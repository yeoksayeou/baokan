<p>時評</p>
<h3>忠勇哉馬占山將軍</h3>
<p>九月十八日日軍暴行突發。我東北擐甲執兵負有保衛國家重責之數十萬健兒。皆於不准抵抗之命令下狼狽退却。坐視自瀋陽以次之數十名。城以及數千萬人民。不數日間盡淪於暴軍鐡蹄踐踏之下。此種怯弱情形之暴露。深令吾人痛心疾首。於我立國精神與民族生命。皆爲若輩喪失殆盡。貽我民族以無窮之恥辱。</p>
<p>於此則有一黑龍江馬占山將軍。本軍人之天職。以男兒之血性。以愛國之忠忱。以不顧成敗不惜生死的精神。以孤軍與犯我黑省之日暴軍作殊死之戰。嫩江橋之役馬將軍親臨前綫。指揮作戰。全軍激於忠義。奮死鏖鬥。前仆後繼。卒能擊退暴軍。使其知我國家尙有克盡厥職之軍人在。此種爲民族爭光榮之英勇戰爭。誠可泣可歌。誠足以愧殺一般不抵抗而遁逃之軍人。惟據目前形勢。日軍尙續續增援不已。馬將軍以絕無援應之孤軍。終恐不能久守。但即此已足以顯馬將軍之忠勇。將軍非不知江省聯絡斷絕。呼援無應一隅之孤軍。不足以敵兇暴之虎狼也。然而忠義所激。不惜生死。將軍之通電云。「占山守土有責。一息尙存决不敢使幾寸之地。淪於異族。」又曰。「我有守土之責。當效命疆塲。誓與寇敵拚命。决不生還。」嗚呼。此種精誠。足以動天地而泣鬼神矣。齊齊哈爾即不幸而終歸失陷。亦不過爲兵家勝敗之常事耳。忠勇哉馬將軍。悲壯哉馬將軍。</p>
<p>我國家年費百分之八十以上之國幣。養二百萬以上之軍隊。然而際此大敵當前。國家危難。而竟不克盡其衛國保民之天職。今有此耿耿孤忠之馬將軍樹之模範。應亦將知所奮勉。知所效法矣。往者不咎。來者可追。國人今且拭目以觀兹後。</p>

<p>（南京）　蔣中正在大會開幕時演辭、昨報刋載未全、兹續如下、</p>
<p>本黨過去的事實、不但没有團結的精神、并且不尊重紀律、總理在世的時候、已發生這種現象、當時就有多少同志、祇要個人有自由、不能爲本黨爭自由、祇要個人有力量、不能爲本黨增力量、而且隨便的反對總理的意旨、甚至侮辱總理領袖的人格、所以總理到了晚年、時時將遵守紀律的話訓誡我們一般同志、記得總理當民國十三年離開廣東要到北平去的前一日、對我們講說是他個人要單身到北京去和軍閥奮鬥、希望一般青年學生及一般黨員、最要緊的一句話、就是「要犧牲個人的自由、把各人的自由平等、都貢獻到革命黨内來、黨内的紀律、都要遵守、黨内的命令、都要服從、只許黨有自由、個人不能自由、革命纔可以成功、」記得總理又講中國國民革命自同盟會到民國十三年、爲什麽還没有成功、就是因爲今天大家說得對、就可結成一個團體、明天如果遇到他個人的利害與團體的利害發生衝突了、他就不惜破壞團體、攻擊領袖、分散力量、以殉其個人的私利、現在我們想起總理這番遺敎、大家同志、必覺得非常痛心、自民國十五年以來、國内一切軍閥官僚的勢力、都被本黨次第削平、十七年以後、黨國已經完全統一、而不意本黨内部糾紛、忽於此時發生、致統一事業、垂成又敗、到了今年、竟成了内憂外患天災人禍一齊交迫的現象、追想總理所說革命事業非敵人所能破壞而是本黨自己破壞自己的一句話、眞使我們傷心之至、總理每於一次革命失敗之後、每每訓示同志、要自己檢查錯誤、尋求失敗的癥結所在、今日四全代會在此開幕、中央同人對於過去的成績、覺得非常慚愧、即使我們全國同志不加責備、同人更何能自恕、但今日内憂外患天災人禍、實爲空前未有之國難、不僅中央同人有負職責、即合全黨同志之才力、共赴國難、亦恐力有不及之虞、故全體黨員、最近有一共同心理、就是大家都覺得非先團結内部、解决本黨的糾紛、不能抵禦外侮、至於如何實現本黨的團結、那自然以親愛精誠爲前提、而同時要不妨害本黨的基本組織、所以此次四次代表大會諸同志所負的責任很大、大家要在不違反黨章與總理遺敎之下、以大會共同的公意來研究出如何使同志團結的方法、我們如果不能想出一個眞實團結的方法、不僅給日本侵略壓迫而已、整個中華民族的前途、將有不堪設想之危險、此次大會是黨的最高權力機關的會議、大家必能在不背本黨的紀律與大會的尊嚴之下、促成本黨的精神團結、來一致抵禦外侮、簡括言之、此次大會兩個最重的使命、就是（一）團結内部、（二）抵禦外侮、這個使命、實比第一次全國代表大會開會時、負有改組本黨改造中國的兩大使命、尤爲重大、我們要負起這種重大的責任、兄弟以爲必須注意兩件事、一是革命的道德、二是革命的精神、什麽是革命的道德呢、在這個革命將有失敗的危險全國對於本黨的信仰漸漸喪失的時候、又有空前的國難來試騐我們革命的道德、我們就要犧牲個人自由、尊重本黨紀律、服從大會公意、發揮出革命黨最高的道德來、什麽是革命的精神呢、就是總理所說的、要有成仁取義的精神、爲國家爲民族而犧牲個人的一切幸福、乃至於生命、我們在這個時候、必須有領導民衆爲國殉難的精神、纔可挽回我們的國運、換句話說、就是一絲不苟且、一毫不游移、義之所至則以全力赴之、一切以革命大義爲依歸、我們能恢復這個革命的道德、提起我們革命的精神、則一切抵禦外侮團結内部的工作、必然可以實現、全體同志、如果都能以黨國之利害爲利害時、我相信黨内問題没有不可以解决的、一切的異同是非、没有不可以我們的精誠去解决的、一致結合、固然無問題、而黨國前途、也自然能得到光明而鞏固了、我們一致認定黨内的團結是我們目前唯一的出路、因爲客觀的事實、不能不使我們有這樣的結論、我們主張已往的糾紛、應以總理所說的同志間給合的精神、來求解决、祇要不背於黨章與總理遺敎、無論如何、應以全力實現我們的團結、這並不是說中央不顧過去的一切、隨便毁壞本黨的統系、現在國難當前、我們全體代表同志、必定知道、（一）日本的横暴侵略、一天天的擴大、（二）水災與匪患以後、已經民不堪命、最近内外交迫、不僅東三省民衆受了莫大的痛苦、即全國同胞、都是在十分的困苦之中、社會經濟、國民生計、已到破産的地步、這樣國危民困的情况、擺在我們面前、怎樣去解决這個困難、是我們大會應該研究的、照現在革命的環境、我們要救國、唯有團結内部、要救黨、也唯有團結内部、要對外、格外的要團結内部、革命是要講求方略的、國難在前、我們要研究、還是解决對外要緊呢、還是解决對内要緊、我們要對外不屈服不妥協、唯有對内講求團結的方法、如果對内不肯退讓、那就對外不能進取、不但不能進展、而且對外與對内的效果、完全成一反比例、我相信對内如能退一步、那就是對外能進十步、假使對内要進一步、其結果必使對外完全失敗、這是必然的定律、這一點、代表諸同志、必能審察我們黨國的環境、而加以適當的决定、總理告訴我們、我們黨員要整齊步驟、聽命於黨、進則同進、退則同退、我們革命黨結合的精神、就是在同進退共生死、黨與黨員的生命是一條的、黨的使命是革命救國、我們所以講團結講寬容、也是爲革命救國、因此我們認爲團結的實現、當以不惜犧牲一切來促成、但不可違背黨章和總理遺敎、更不能違反四全大會的公意、否則如果僅僅達到團結目的之一部、而毁損了全黨的精神和紀律、則於黨於國都無益處的、總之、我誠懇希望大會的代表各同志、認清我們的環境和事實、在愛護本黨基礎和不背本黨紀律之下、實現我們的團結、抵禦空前的外侮、以期不負我們總理和先烈、對得起全黨同志和全國同胞、謹以十分誠意、祝大會的成功、（十三日專電）</p>

<p>— 燕子</p>
<p>宋慶獨守錦州</p>
<p>自朝鮮東林黨變起。項城時爲朝鮮專使。倉猝奔還。中日之戰禍。遂至不可收拾。湘撫吳大澂請纓出師。兵駐關外。朝命以四川提督宋慶副之。宋老於軍務。爲中法諒山戰勝法軍之馮子材部下。所部士兵。久經戰陣。訓練有方。天破曉。全軍整隊入操塲。演習打靶。吳軍聞槍聲。疑是敵軍陷陣。全師奔潰。宋營本爲犄角之勢。幾被牽動。宋率隊退駐錦州。嚴修戰備。日軍抽調大隊。圍攻匝月。用盡種種方法。而不得逞。宋部下兵。士精射擊。發無不中。伏陴禦敵。殲攻城日軍千餘人。日軍畏之如虎。迨馬關和議成。朝命宋回任四川提督。率師還川。錦州士紳攀轅無計。餞於西郊。酒半酣。宋起立致謝辭。極沉痛。合座爲之泣數行下。其戰績散見於各家筆記者極夥。錦州人士至今稱道弗衰。洵甲午戰役中之名將也。</p>

<h3>佛蘭克林（上）</h3>
<p>小徒弟列傳之一</p>
<p>佛蘭克林Benjamin　Franklin生於公元一七○六年，死於一七九○年，活了八十四歲。他死了之後，墓碑上刻有幾行字：「他從皇帝的手裏奪來了政權，從天上奪來了電氣。」</p>
<p>這一篇很短的墓誌銘，不啻爲佛蘭克林一生功業學問之小影。他是一位政治家，文學家，科學家；你如果讀一讀他的自傳，便要驚訝的發現這位偉人只是從一個小徒弟出身的。他參加美洲獨立運動的功績，誰都知道，不必我來多話。我只要叙述他做徒弟時代之小史，和他在科學上之貢獻。</p>
<p>他八歲進拉丁文小學，九歲改入算寫學校，十歲便因家計困難，輟了學，跟着他父親學做蠟燭和肥皂。他不歡喜做這個手藝，却善游泳，會划船，常想航海去。父親知道他的傾向，很是擔憂，便時常帶他在街上參觀木匠，磚匠，銅匠，轆轤匠及其他匠人的工作，以便選擇一行，作爲終身職業。這是個個父母或敎師應該盡的責任。可是走馬看花的參觀也没有多大用處。我們必須引導小孩們仔細的看，看了能做出來，才有效騐。佛蘭克林在自傳裏說這種親切詳細的參觀對於他很有影響。後來，家裏東西破了，用不着匠人，他自己會修理，科學實騐要儀器用，自己也可以做。這些本領都是從參觀手藝中得來。</p>
<p>他雖是在蠟燭店裏做徒弟，但是好看書。兩年後他父親便因此呌他去學印刷業。一七一七年他的哥哥詹姆士從英國帶了印刷機和字模到波士頓來設立印刷所，他便秉承父命和詹姆士立約做九年徒弟。這時他纔是十二歲，要到二十一歲滿約。他自從在印刷所裏做了徒弟，便認識了好些書舖裏的徒弟，於是全城的書舖便成了他的流通圖書館。他每逢借了書來，連夜就要看完，因爲照規矩次日早上是必須還人家的。這樣他雖是做徒弟，同時也算是做學生，因爲他自己看的書比平常學校裏的學生所看的還要多好幾倍咧。</p>
<h3>倭報之諷刺畫</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>倭國以蕞爾三島。不足允殖生民。且時有火山爆發。地壞震動之虞。於是更堅其侵略之野心。而物産饒富疆域廣漠之中華。適當其衝。予取予求。得尺進尺。致成今日之局勢者。固非一朝夕所得而醖釀也。猶憶甲午之役。倭寇旣佔朝鮮。傲睨寰球。目空一切。彼邦之時事新報。嘗刋載一圖。圖爲二女神。持輪戰。英姿颯爽。不讓鬚眉。蓋指倭與英吉利而言也。二女神之中間。立二童作孺慕狀。蓋指中華與朝鮮而言也。中華之地位何若。朝鮮之地位又何若。以絕不相等之地位。而倭人竟以同學地位目光視之。其欲滅亡我中華者。數十年前。已昭然若揭矣。近自瀋陽變起。倭寇縱兵肆暴。焚掠殺戮。無所不至。每佔一地。其報紙輒喧騰其事。以爲計得。且發號外。沿街喚賣。有似雷展。某報且刋一諷刺畫。繪一惡魔。立於瘡痍徧體之孩童後。一寬袍御屐者。手執一劍。殺惡魔而撫存孩童。一若父兄之於子弟然。夫我國之軍閥。奪利爭權。兵連禍結。固一作祟之惡魔也。中華之内憂外患。災眚迭呈。固不啻瘡痍之徧體也。觀此畫幅。能不觸目驚心。而我中華其甘受倭人之保護乎。抑勉力亟圖自保乎。國人其自决。存亡關頭。在此一舉。可不警惕哉。</p>
<h3>世界小事記</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>别開生面的新閙鐘西方人每天早起。總得喝一杯茶。或一杯咖啡。豪富的男女。只要一睜開眼。自有男女僕人。棒着茶盤上來。就在床上給他們喝得舒舒服服。至於一般没有妻子或没有僕人的窮光棍。旣没人在相當的時候喚醒他。更那有茶和咖啡喝。於是不得不想個救濟之法了。最近倫敦的發明品博覽會。lnuentionsExhibition中。就有一雙别開生面的新閙鐘陳列在那裏。不知是那一位表同情於窮光棍的發明家所發明的。這新閙鐘的功用。不但能喚醒你的沈睡。并且做茶給你喝。只須在夜間臨睡的時候。開好了機括。到得明天早上規定的時刻。就有電流燃着了煤氣爐。爐上早已放好了水鍋。茶壺中也會自動的放好了茶葉或咖啡。一會兒鍋中的水沸了。茶也做好了。於是鈴聲大震。不但催你起身。并報告你茶已做好。可以起來喝茶了。這樣的新發明品。何等的便利。眞可以算得上窮光棍的賢内助。</p>
<h3>節婦失戀自縊之奇聞</h3>
<p>— 孫籌成</p>
<p>頃據杭友來函。述及留下附近之東穆塢。發生節婦失戀投環自盡之奇事。爰特轉録如下。</p>
<p>東穆塢在大嶺下。山明水秀。茶樹遍野。居民百餘户。有張某植茶數十畝。家道小康。民五娶附近甘溪女爲婦。貌頗娟秀。性亦温柔。張某終日厮守閨房。不忍一刻離。積久尫羸不堪。次年即抛妻長逝。蓋棺時。女撫屍痛哭。願以身殉。經戚族慰勸而止。自後遂擯脂粉而寡言笑。勤家事以撫遺孤。故親族中。無不以節婦目之。</p>
<p>女因田多人少。需人帮助。乃雇同塢邵某爲長工。邵年富力强。工作甚勤。家内本有一婦。因貧鬻去。力傭自給。張婦夫死時。感伉儷情深。爲禮敎所束縛。强自抑制。未敢放蕩。厥後覺甇獨孤苦。無人慰藉。漸有不甘獨宿之意。被邵窺破隠情。乘間引誘。久之遂爲所惑。實行戀愛。於是日爲主僕。夜作夫妻。卿卿我我。相是恨晚。但表面上仍蒙貞節之假面具。外人鑒於乃夫蓋棺時。渠如是情深。亦不意其中途變節。仍稱頌不已。</p>
<p>詎料邵某居心險詐。不特戀其色。并涎其財。初識時。交鳴此翼。風雨不間。鞠躬盡瘁。冀博其歡。婦因久旱。得此甘霖。宛如麻醉。邵見已入彀。託故告貸。婦恐其不歡。惟命是聽。金盡後繼以首飾。首飾完復售田産。奈家資有限。慾壑難塡。如是數年。則張某所遺之産。無論動與不動。爲邵一人消耗殆盡矣。旋因屢索不遂。知已金盡床頭。邵遂藉故他去。避不見面。</p>
<p>張婦自失戀後。多方探聽邵之蹤跡。冀續舊歡。終日如醉如痴。於是假貞節之黑幕揭穿。親族平素對其尊敬之心。一變而爲鄙棄矣。旋悉邵已另有新歡。正在度其蜜月生活。婦因數載以來。受其迷惑。非特失身。且又喪財。名節掃地。悔恨交加。遂不顧顔面。親往邵家。以興問罪之師。詎邵已聞風。即挾新歡而遠避。至是張婦進退兩難。即萌厭世之念。遂潛入邵屋而自縊。旁晚邵回。覩狀大驚。倩人赴甘溪邀其母來。經人調停。禮懺三日。并代棺殮以贖前愆。於是節婦失戀自縊之奇聞。喧傳閭里矣。</p>

<p>首都歌女。多有系出名門。以心傷潔養之難。身遭亂離之苦。致不得不出其閨中所習之歌曲。以賣藝養親。亦可傷己。就余所知者。如飛龍閣歌女丁美玉。錢塘望族。世居西子湖濱。父某。曾任軍官。歷著戰功。不幸以某事。身繫囹圄。從此獄吏威尊。將軍命賤。鐡窗夜永。省釋難期矣。於是美玉於上書贖罪之餘。復以阿兄學未成名。難責負百里之米。而萱堂年事已高。敢不謀一日之歡。乃於無可奈何之中。爲委曲求全之計。幸有梨園之一技。勝謀卜肆之百錢。遂舉家遷京。使凄凉色相。乞食歌樓。事雖近乎賣藝。義亦等於售文。無淫奔越禮之嫌。亦菽水承歡之義。友人天口翁。於顧曲之餘。贈以聯云。「木蘭秣馬。緹縈上書。美德護靈椿。感通三竺慈雲。化作美人香草。」「太素羅裳。飛瓊錦瑟。玉容開滿月。願洗六朝金粉。本來玉潔冰清。」</p>
<h3>短訊</h3>
<p>— 心權</p>
<p>大戲劇家馬丁法雷文所編之名劇「牢獄義鴛」（The　Coiwinal　Cold）曾在紐約舞臺公演一年。獲得不易獲得之戲劇總會獎賞。嗣攝爲影片。輸運來滬。在南京大戲院開映。有舞臺不能有之特長。爲最有魔力之哀情影片。其佈局純爲小說體裁。重於表演情節。而對白不多。能深刻描寫犧牲愛情之痛苦。背景絕佳。叛獄一幕。機槍掃射。慘目驚心。無與倫比。大明星赫士登氏。飾審判官。嚴酷非凡。描摹入骨。菲立福摩斯飾漢格。尤富内心表演。康絲登之審判官女。表演亦不弱。其餘諸角。皆頗可觀。此片導演霍克氏。能以忠實之傳譯。而予人以極大之刺激。亦屬可嘉云。</p>
<p>聲明前日思想的母親一文中排脫了一段。現將補録如下。</p>
<p>「走不通而不覺得困難。這是庸人。連脚都没有動而心裡却虚造出萬千困難。這是妄人。走不通而感覺有困難便要解决這困難。不到困難解决不止。這是科學家。」</p>

<h3>鄕下人又到上海（十六）</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>那個黑的測老，却穿了一身白的衣服。黑的面孔上，裝了一對黄的眼睛，嵌上兩列白的牙齒，眞有一些兒鬼相。鄕下人想：這位張飛的兄弟，周倉的阿哥，不知到電車上來幹些什麽事的？倒要子細看看。</p>
<p>却見那個測老上了車，並不作聲，祗向乘客們，一個一個的查他們的票。許多乘客們，對於這一張小小的票，保存之法不一。有的握在手中的，有的塞在帽子裏的，有的夾在耳朶裏的，有的啣在口中的。那測老不聲不響地一一查騐過了，眞似鬼一般的泯然的下去了。</p>
<p>「這就呌做測老。」鄕下人算今天又學會了一個乖。</p>
<p>「三馬路到了，請下去吧。」這是賣票人特地對於鄕下人打招呼。不然，賣票人向來不對於乘客報告到了那裏，你要是走過了路程，也不關他事，照例要補票。</p>
<p>而且當鄕下人下車時，他還指點了他一下，他說：「你望西走去，没有幾家門面，就是大舞臺了。」說完那句話兒，電車叮叮噹噹的又向南開去了。</p>
<p>鄕下人聽着賣票人的指導，果然向西走了幾步。那時天色已晚，馬路上的電燈通明了，來來往往的汽車，馬車，人力車，脚踏車，塌車，小車，把路人都擠住了。鄕下人好容易擠過去，却早見了大舞臺三個大字。他如今不免躊躇起來，他還記得他外甥阿木林是給他說在法租界界的梅蘭坊，現在怎麽弄到了大舞臺來了。此地是不是法租界，他也莫名其妙，怎麽他們又說阿木林在這裏？我的照片，又在大舞臺對過呢？</p>
<p>這時候，大舞臺正在上座的當兒，許多染了梅毒（註五）的男男女女，陸陸續續的向戲園子裏走。還有一班案目，手中挾了一疊戲單。在門口見有人遠遠地走來，也不管是來看戲的，不是來看戲的，嚷成一片。見有戴眼鏡的，使呼：「眼鏡！眼鏡！來了一個眼鏡！」見有穿長衫者，便喚：「長衫！長衫！來了一位長衫！」誰先喊了的，誰去招待他，算是誰的主顧。</p>
<p>鄕下人正在東張西望，案目以爲他也是來看戲了。一個案目咳了一聲嗽：</p>
<p>「阿木林！阿木林！來了一個阿木林！」說時，又向傍邊的人，丢了一個眼色。</p>
<p>鄕下人大奇。想我的外甥，眞在此地。</p>
<p>（註五）近人嘲捧梅蘭芳者爲梅毒。</p>

<h3>法將福煦歐戰日記顧昻若譯</h3>
<p>我並且商請波蘭軍總司令黑勒將軍准許把波軍第一師參加進攻、</p>
<p>如此、因各將士的用命、勞倫攻勢戰遂迅速的佈置妥當、步兵二十八師、騎兵三師、在大隊砲兵和六百輛坦克掩護之下準備在十一月十四日開始進攻、戰綫長二十英里、將與砲火猛烈的二百哩戰綫緊接、惟此方面作戰有其新目標而無勁敵、故可望一戰即克十數哩、過此即爲荒凉災區、很已阻礙了聯軍的進行、此方面的隊伍便可與之會師進攻、是爲進兵萊茵直趨柏林之役、我軍由這路進取、大戰的最後勝利可操左券、</p>
<p>十一月初、凡倫西下首以至堪特、喜爾特河之線爲聯軍左翼的障礙、香本方面、塞爾河的强固的防線、則爲我軍中路的障礙、</p>
<p>美第一軍和法第四軍在苗斯河左岸挺進、便足以自東抄擊塞爾河線、法第一軍和英右翼在西面撼疴亞斯河之北、自南攻喜爾特河之線、法蘭特集團軍北取堪特、</p>
<p>我預料北方必有重要發展、便把我的司令部於十月十八日從朋朋移到聖里、現在惟有根據預定的戰略不間斷的進行、我軍不得已而停頓的戰局、到了十月底已告一段落、</p>
<p>十一月一日至五日、美第一軍和法第四軍已包抄成功、進至勒希斯·巴蒙·斯敦尼之線、英軍右翼以狄朋尼軍的掩護、也進至愛佛斯·腓列普、五日六日、我軍便告完全佔領塞爾河之線、</p>
<p>我爲此曾與海格元帥有一度協商、我請他把英軍右翼挺進的時候、他要把暫附於法蘭特集團軍的英第二軍撤回、擔任左翼、並可重新配置他的兵力、我告訴他、如其希望法蘭特集團軍成功、則英第二軍非待其克復比利時直至喜爾特河、不能調動、</p>
<p>實則、法蘭特集團軍在十一月一日即已達到喜爾特河堪特上首、英第二軍就在十一月四日調歸海格元帥了、我便在十一月二日照會比王道、</p>
<p>法蘭集團軍經幾度勝利之後、已進至喜爾特河堪特上首、今後進攻喜爾特河的防線的主要戰事、將由凡倫西南面的英軍擔任、所以全部英軍應歸英軍總司令支配、福煦元帥因懇比王自十一月四日起將英第二軍撥還海格元帥直接指揮、</p>
<p>其時、我鑒於法第一軍在十月二十四日至二十七日間的勝利、便於二十七日寫信給海格元帥道、</p>
<p>狄朋尼軍進展順利、英軍主力曰可聯絡法第一軍向蒙斯·愛佛斯·和拉歇普爾目標進攻、</p>
<p>十月二十九日、海格元帥便令其第四第三和第一三軍準備在十一月三日重新進攻、惟至四日始開始進攻、法第一軍爲其掩護、結果完全勝利、</p>
<p>德軍一再受創、更以左翼法美兩軍不斷的前進、德軍防線動搖、五日開始在蒙斯運河和愛斯南河之間大規模的退却、此後苗斯河方面也動搖了、</p>
<p>八日、法蘭特集團軍的法比兩軍在意克和奥特那間佔領了喜爾特河的渡口、敵軍聞訊更加猛退現從荷蘭邊境以至苗斯河之高斯特、敵軍已實行總退却、</p>
<p>聯軍緊追、希望一鼓作氣攻過萊茵河、而使敵軍瓦解、因萊茵河的天然屏障</p>

<p>威爾遜總統在十月八日發出覆牒、主張德軍立即退出侵佔區域、作爲訂立休戰條約的先决條件、</p>
<p>同日（十月八日）、我首先自動把敵軍應負的義務通知克萊孟沙君、其義務根據下列三大原則、</p>

<p>(Harbin) The fighting on the Tao'an-Ang'angxi line ceased at 7:30 AM on the 12th. Japanese troops completely retreated after 6:00 AM, instead dividing into small units to launch flanking attacks on the positions of our garrison troops on the Da Xing defense line. Our troops stood firm all day, repelling the enemy when they attacked. After 7:00 AM, enemy artillery fire gradually subsided. Our troops killed a Japanese captain and over a hundred soldiers, and captured over ten prisoners. Two regiments of cavalry from Cheng Zhiyuan's brigade arrived at Jiangqiao this morning and immediately joined the defense of Sanjianfang. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Four Japanese planes flew from Changchun to Tao'an today. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Harbin) Feng Zhanhai's regiment captured a Korean spy in Acheng, and discovered a letter from the Japanese Kwantung Army headquarters to various brigades and regiments regarding the deployment of garrisons. The spy has been taken into custody. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) A certain Mr. Zhu from an institution in Harbin has invented a hand-held machine gun capable of firing fifty rounds per minute. He is going to Heihe today to present it to Ma Zhanshan. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the Japanese army's failed attack on Heihe, they retreated completely and concentrated on the west bank of Jiangqiao. The Japanese army suffered approximately 500 casualties in this attack. Lieutenant General Domon, the commander of the Japanese division, has led his troops from Jilin to provide reinforcements, planning a second attack. To defend against the Japanese army, Ma Zhanshan has transferred the brigades of Zhang Dianjiu, Xing Zhanqing, and Su Bingwen to the Tao'an-Ang'angxi line, with a total strength of over 70,000 men. Four regiments of the Tuntian Army artillery have joined the central route. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A telegram from Heihe Province on the 12th stated that on the afternoon of the 12th, a combined Japanese cavalry and artillery force launched a fierce attack on our cavalry. Fierce fighting is currently underway, but the infantry lines have not yet made contact. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>

By dusk, the fighting was extremely fierce, and our morale was very high, but the infantry front had not yet made contact. Another telegram stated that a Japanese plane scouted our positions, and the 1st Cavalry Brigade engaged the Japanese 3rd Cavalry Regiment, immediately killing a Japanese major general and a soldier each. Our troops were encouraged by the vice-commander and morale was extremely high. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) The Chinese Eastern Railway office here received a long-distance call today from the company's representative in Qiqihar, stating that fierce fighting between Chinese and Japanese troops lasted for three hours last night, and the outcome is unknown. However, prior to this report, news was received that the fighting between Chinese and Japanese troops began on Wednesday night. The sound of artillery fire could also be heard in Qiqihar. It is rumored that the Black Army has retreated to a location outside Ang'angxi, but officials have not yet received a report on the outcome. According to reports, both Chinese and Japanese troops along the Tao'an-Ang'angxi Railway have been actively preparing for war in recent days. General Ma Zhanshan is determined to resist the Japanese invasion of his territory. It is reported that the Japanese army attacking Heihe has a total of 20,000 men. Ma has selected a thousand cavalry to defend against them. Ma is currently implementing a forced conscription system in Heihe Province. New recruits are being used to dig trenches, and sixty people who refused to obey orders have been executed by firing squad. Ma's military discipline is very strict. (13th Guomin News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Chinese authorities received reports today stating that the number of Japanese troops gathered on the south bank of the Nen River has greatly increased, preparing to launch a new attack upon receiving instructions from Tokyo. It is reported that Japanese troops are stationed approximately five miles from Jiangqiao. Japanese authorities are eager to know the position that Soviet Russia will take after the Japanese army occupies Heihe. According to information obtained by Chinese authorities, if Soviet Russia sends troops into Manchuria, they will pass through Mongolia to Hailar, which is approximately 110 miles from Manzhouli. It is reported that Hailar has prepared 300 covered wagons and 100 factory cars in order to transport troops along the Chinese Eastern Railway to Qiqihar if necessary. It is reported that Japanese authorities are deeply concerned that Soviet Russia will supply Ma Zhanshan with military equipment, so they have dispatched troops to various locations in order to prevent the transportation of Russian war materiel. Chinese sources predict that the Japanese army will definitely want to occupy Qiqihar, and further predict that the Japanese army will then proceed to Harbin, using the pretext of protecting the lives and property of Japanese residents and preventing attacks by defeated soldiers or mobs. (13th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) Chinese troops in the Ang'angxi area dispatched a strong cavalry force, bypassing the Japanese right flank at Da Xing, forcing the Japanese positions, and the situation is tightening. (12th Allied Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Zhang Haipeng Sends Representatives to See Zhang Wan</h3>
<p>(Beiping) It is reported that Zhang Haipeng, due to the advice of various parties and the fact that the Black Army is difficult to attack, has come to his senses. Yesterday, he sent representatives to Beiping to see Zhang Wan, recounting the situation of being oppressed by the Japanese. He stated that if he is allowed to repent and reform, he will lead his troops to resist the Japanese army. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Official sources have not yet received confirmation regarding Zhang Haipeng's escape. It is reported that Zhang recently suffered a severe relapse of his liver disease after suffering military defeats. The Japanese army is still forcing him to advance, but Zhang requested a delay, which was denied, so he angrily killed his supervisors and fled. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Honjo Shigeru's Ultimatum to Ma Zhanshan</h3>
<p>Demanding Ma's Resignation and the Handing Over of the Provincial Capital, Deadline Was Midnight the Night Before</p>
<p>(Beiping) Ma Zhanshan telegraphed Zhang Xueliang on the 12th, stating that he received a telegram from Honjo this afternoon, the original text of which reads: "Regarding your country's demands, I, the undersigned, request the following three items: (1) Chairman Ma Zhanshan should resign; (2) The Hebei Province military can withdraw from Qiqihar; (3) A portion of the Japanese military, for the safety guarantee of the Tao'an-Ang'angxi line, should advance to the Ang'angxi station on the Tao'an-Ang'angxi line. A response is requested before 12:00 midnight on November 12th. To Chairman of Heilongjiang, Ma Zhanshan, Commander of the Kwantung Army, Honjo Shigeru, November 12th, Showa 6." (13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Ma Zhanshan urgently telegraphed Vice-Commander Zhang on the afternoon of the 12th, stating that Honjo sent Representative Major Hayashi to deliver an ultimatum to Ma orally, demanding that Ma and the Chinese troops hand over Heilongjiang by midnight on the 12th. Vice-Commander Zhang immediately telegraphed Ma, instructing him to sternly refuse and defend to the end, and stated: "(1) Is this ultimatum issued by Honjo personally, or does it represent the Tokyo government? (2) Honjo's representative, Major Hayashi, did not carry identification papers, and a mere telegram is insufficient proof; (3) The ultimatum arrived on the afternoon of the 12th, but without waiting for a response, Japanese cavalry and artillery regiments had already launched a fierce attack on our positions. What is the reason for this?" (13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Military authorities told reporters today that Commander Honjo did not send Ma Zhanshan an ultimatum, but gave him a friendly warning, advising him to withdraw from Qiqihar and transfer police authority in Heilongjiang to Zhang Haipeng and Zhang Jinghui, because Ma's troops continuing to be in the province is causing great anxiety to the Japanese people. If Ma's troops provoke, then Ma will be held responsible. (13th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Continuing to Assist Thugs in Committing Disturbances</h3>
<p>Firing Cannons from Rooftops onto Chinese Streets, Gunfire Resounded Greatly Last Night</p>
<p>Plainclothes Brigade Routs Chinese this Morning, Searching Door to Door</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese authorities agreed with the city authorities on the 12th that Japanese soldiers would not fire guns on the night of the 12th, but they went back on their word. Gunfire erupted from 11:00 PM, becoming more intense at 4:00 AM on the 13th. The Japanese army set up six small cannons on the roof of the Zhongyuan Company building and installed another heavy cannon at noon on the 13th. At 11:30 PM on the 12th, they fired several shots at Chinese Street from the sixth floor, and the extent of the damage is unknown. At 6:00 AM on the 13th, they fired two more shots. One shell landed at the Wu Bao (Afternoon News) newspaper office on Guangxing Street, collapsing the top of the building. Employees of the newspaper were rescued by the Red Cross. The Wanguo Bridge was closed at 10:00 PM on the 12th and reopened to traffic at 10:00 AM on the 13th. Plainclothes brigades were discovered in the areas of Shenzhuangzi and Fenglin Village in Hedong on the night of the 12th, and 18 people were captured on the spot. A group of plainclothes brigades was discovered outside the new railway station in Xiaoyuzhuang at 2:00 AM on the 13th, many wearing security team uniforms, attempting to attack the station. They were exposed and over ten people were killed and three were seriously injured. Our defense line from Nankai to the Ningjia Bridge has been completed. Sandbags have been piled up in front of Nankai Middle School and brick walls have been built on Tianhai Road. Brick walls are being built along the embankment on the west bank of the Xiaoche River in Yangjia Garden, and machine guns are being installed. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) From the night of the 12th to the morning of the 13th, the plainclothes brigade launched several counterattacks, all of which were repelled. At the same time, the Japanese barracks fired over ten shells at our defense positions. Male and female students from Nankai Middle School and Nankai University have been completely evacuated. From the night of the 12th to the morning of the 13th, groups of three to five plainclothes brigades were discovered in the "Three No-Man's Land" in the southern city, as well as Rongye, Fu'an, Yong'an, Dongxing, Guangshan Streets, and all were dispersed. At 10:00 AM on the 13th, a member of the plainclothes brigade was captured at the Caochang Temple. At the same time, several members of the plainclothes brigade threw bombs behind the City Party Headquarters and were dispersed by the police. From 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM on the 13th, the Red Cross and Red Swastika Society dispatched multiple cars to distribute large cakes and steamed buns to residents in the Nankai-Ningjia Bridge area, and to rescue women and children. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Starting at 10:00 AM on the 13th, the Chinese area conducted door-to-door searches for plainclothes brigades, but the Japanese Concession was not only not searched, but plainclothes brigades were openly training at the Haiguang Temple and were allowed to carry weapons in the Japanese Concession. Because the Japanese barracks' cellar could not accommodate everyone, Japanese women and children were placed in the French Concession from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM on the 13th, and many Chinese people took the opportunity to escape. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The authorities announced on the 12th that Zhang Bi did indeed go to Dalian under the protection of Japanese soldiers on the night of the 11th. However, investigations show that Zhang is still in the Japanese Concession, directing the plainclothes brigade. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) At 6:00 AM this morning, beside the Dinggong Temple in the southern city of Tianjin, the Japanese army suddenly fired machine guns at our security police, and our team police resisted with efforts until 8:00 AM without stopping. The city is peaceful. Plainclothes brigades are still being discovered in various places. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) It is said that last night at around 8:00 PM in Tianjin, thugs suddenly bribed over 300 rickshaw pullers and boatmen, hoping to rise up again. Our police and security team immediately used force to suppress them. These people did not fire their guns and fled at the sight of the police, still trying to escape into the Japanese Concession. The Japanese military used machine guns to fire at them, killing over two hundred and thirty people, with only twenty or so not killed. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Tianjin Japanese Concession Increases Security</h3>
<p>Barriers Added at Borders</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Tianjin Japanese Concession has increased security. In addition to the original barbed wire and earthworks at the border with the Chinese area, a second line of earthwork barriers has been added everywhere, increasing the height from three feet to five feet, and more Japanese soldiers have been dispatched to guard each location. The Japanese authorities have also ordered Japanese women and children to be accommodated in the Haiguang Temple barracks if necessary, and then transported to Dalian. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The back doors of shops and residences in the Japanese Concession that lead to Chinese streets have been sealed off by Japanese soldiers with electric fences. Three hundred Japanese soldiers forcibly occupied the second floor of the Zhongyuan Company building, resulting in the complete loss of goods. The French Concession captured one member of the plainclothes brigade in Lishanzhan on the 12th, and eight in Xikai on the 13th, along with three bombs. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese recently secretly recruited six to seven hundred bandits in the eastern part of Tianjin, using small motorboats to supply them with arms and ammunition, attempting to harass Special District One. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese are creating an atmosphere of terror in the concession, saying that the Chinese wanted to use the pretext of inspecting the plainclothes team on the 12th to attack the Japanese Concession. In fact, the joint Chinese-Japanese inspection was requested by the Japanese side to avoid the establishment of a buffer zone by various countries. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The negotiations between the Chinese and Japanese authorities that were rumored yesterday seem to have broken down. This afternoon, the Japanese Concession was unusually active again, with women and children in the concession moving to other concessions, and the defenses of other concessions have been strengthened. Several volunteer teams from the British Concession have been ordered to be on duty. Although rumors are rife, the attitude of foreigners is very calm. The only problem is that many Chinese servants have stayed in the Chinese area and have not been able to return, and there is also a shortage of meat and other food. (13th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Head of Tianjin Plainclothes Team Is Despised by His Hometown</h3>
<p>(Beiping) A visitor from Fengrun County said that Li Jichun, the head of the Tianjin plainclothes team, is originally from the south gate of the county. His younger brother, Li Erdui, strongly opposes his elder brother's traitorous behavior and has declared in the county that Jichun's betrayal is a disgrace to the Li family, and he will sever relations with Jichun from this day forward. The people of Fengrun also do not recognize Jichun as a fellow villager and refuse to allow him to return to his hometown. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Ships Transporting Arms to Tianjin Refuse Customs Inspection</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The Tianchao Maru arrived in Tianjin on the morning of the 13th. Japanese soldiers reported to customs that there were a thousand boxes of military food and requested exemption from inspection. Customs officials inspected the so-called food and found that the boxes were marked with the words "Northeast Arsenal," clearly indicating that they were arms. They stated that an inspection was required before unloading. The Japanese soldiers refused inspection, saying that they would be transported back to Dalian on the morning of the 14th. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Several Japanese ships in the port were seen today carrying soldiers. The Japanese said that because the Chinese military authorities are now searching ships, and because the river ships between Tianjin and Dagu have been bombed, they are specially carrying soldiers for protection. (13th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Tianjin Chamber of Commerce Asks Foreign Troops to Patrol Buffer Zone</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Tianjin General Chamber of Commerce has decided to officially request the provincial and municipal governments to send a formal letter to the garrison troops of the four countries, England, France, the United States, and Italy, to patrol and inspect the 300-meter buffer zone in order to avoid the escalation of the situation and the impact on Chinese and foreign merchants. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Since the riot occurred on Sunday, gunfire has been heard every night, causing people to be uneasy. The gunfire was especially intense last night and did not stop until dawn this morning. The plan to search the so-called "neutral zone" has not been realized due to mutual suspicion between the two sides. The Chinese police fear that they will be bombarded by Japanese soldiers if they enter the area, and the Japanese also fear that the Chinese police will take the opportunity to attack. According to a responsible source, it has been agreed that the Chinese authorities will send several squads of military police, each squad consisting of fifty men, to "inspect the neutral zone." Each squad will be monitored by two Japanese. (13th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Puyi Leaves Tianjin for Shenyang</h3>
<p>(Beiping) According to Japanese sources, Puyi left Tianjin in disguise late on the 10th, escorted by the Japanese to Dalian, and will go to Shenyang immediately. Zaifeng, the former Qing Regent, who originally lived in the British Concession, was accompanied to the Japanese Concession on the 10th by the Japanese and lives with Puyi. Reporters outside Shenyang reported that Puyi has arrived and is preparing to announce his restoration before the 16th. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) It is rumored that Li Jichun has gone to Dalian with Doihara and Puyi, but according to Puyi's residence, Puyi is still in Tianjin. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The official authorities have neither confirmed nor denied the story that Puyi was kidnapped and boarded a small steamer to Dagu and then went to Dalian. However, responsible parties all believe that Puyi has indeed left Tianjin. (13th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) It is now confirmed that Puyi left Tianjin on Wednesday to go to Dalian. Chinese circles widely rumor that Puyi sneaked out of Tianjin during the riots there, being kidnapped by the Japanese to a small steamship, then taken on a Japanese destroyer from Tanggu; but Japanese officials emphatically deny this news. (13th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Strict Security Measures in Beiping</h3>
<p>Run on Banks Occurs</p>
<p>(Beiping) Due to the disruption of telephone service between Beiping and Tianjin, rumors are rampant in Beiping, and a run on banks has occurred. The Tianjin branches of banks such as Jiaotong Bank transferred ten million yuan in cash to Beiping for relief. Five million yuan arrived on the evening of the 12th. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) At 10:00 PM last night, the American authorities ordered all Marines to assemble in the camp. Even those who were in the cinema were recalled, as it was heard that plainclothes thugs were planning to riot. The soldiers of other embassies also strictly guarded against possible attacks. For a time, people were panicked, but the night passed peacefully. Although martial law has not been declared, the Chinese authorities have taken extremely strict precautions. After 11:00 PM, pedestrians on the road are ordered to stop and questioned. Those who do not obey are shot. Last night, a messenger from the Beijing Daobao (Beijing Guide) newspaper was shot and seriously injured for not stopping. (13th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yu Xuezhong issued a notice strictly prohibiting the spread of rumors. Those who are caught will be dealt with by military law. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>There Are Rumors of the Loss of Tongliao</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Foreign sources report that Tongliao is now in the hands of the Japanese army. Dahushan and other places are still safe. The Japanese army in Shenyang is extremely tyrannical. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The League of Nations Will Open on Schedule</h3>
<p>Japan Gathers Diplomatic Talents in Paris, U.S. Representative Will Propose a Compromise</p>
<p>(Paris) The League of Nations Executive Council has been set to meet on November 16 at 4:00 PM to discuss the Sino-Japanese dispute over the Three Eastern Provinces. (13th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) What position the United States will take after the League of Nations Executive Council meets on Sunday has caused much anxiety to the League. At first, the news that the U.S. government sent Dawes as its representative was greeted with joy. However, after hearing that Dawes was only in Paris to participate in discussions when necessary and would not attend the meeting in principle, there was some disappointment. If the U.S. representative or observer does not attend the meeting, then the U.S. government has almost withdrawn from its original position. Even if its sympathy for the League of Nations has not diminished, its cooperation with the League may not be as close as before. If so, then the Japanese delegation, which originally opposed the United States' participation, will have won a great victory. If it does not withdraw, then Gilbert will still be an observer, with Dawes behind him, so that they can consult at any time. Japan is now gathering its diplomatic talents in Paris, which shows that it understands the importance of this meeting. The Japanese ambassadors to the United Kingdom and Italy both have special achievements and are known for their prudence. They have been ordered to help Yoshizawa in his negotiations. At this critical time, they will definitely be beneficial to the Japanese delegation. According to the report from the Chinese representative received by the League of Nations Secretariat today, Japan sent an ultimatum to General Ma Zhanshan, ordering him to resign and hand over Qiqihar to the Japanese army, with a deadline of 12:00 PM last night. However, no news of any developments has been received so far. (12th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) Sending Dawes to France to participate in the resolutions of the League of Nations Executive Council has received satisfactory criticism. The Parisian newspaper Le Journal published an article by the Socialist Party member Baillie, which said: "The United States' sending of Dawes to France can give us the best reason to hope that Americans will prove to be good conscious and practical members. Americans have already prevented many foolish things." It also said that Japan does not comply with the resolutions of the League of Nations, and Briand's recent intervention has been ineffective. Japan has decided to seize Qiqihar, and a major war may break out. (13th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) Under Secretary of State Castle expressed optimism today about the Sino-Japanese negotiations, saying that a compromise solution acceptable to both China and Japan will be proposed at the League of Nations Executive Council meeting in Paris on Sunday, but did not announce the content of the solution. (12th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japan's five basic points will be submitted for discussion after the League of Nations Executive Council meets. Today, according to news from Washington, a compromise solution will be submitted to the Executive Council. Japanese officials believe that Japan has no room for compromise on the five basic points and that China must first recognize them before discussions can begin. However, there seems to be a feeling among officials that if the article on recognizing treaty obligations does not specifically mention the 1915 treaty, then China may start negotiations based on the five basic points. The 1915 treaty was the result of the Twenty-One Demands, and China has always pointed out that the treaty was signed under duress. (13th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>How Loyal and Brave is General Ma Zhanshan!</h3>
<p>On September 18th, the Japanese army's violent act broke out suddenly. Hundreds of thousands of soldiers in our Northeast, armed and carrying weapons and responsible for defending the country, all retreated in disarray under orders not to resist, watching dozens of cities from Shenyang downwards and tens of millions of people fall into the trampling hooves of the brutal army in a matter of days. The exposure of this kind of cowardly situation has deeply saddened us and caused us great distress. The spirit of our country and the life of our nation have been almost completely lost by these people, leaving our nation with endless shame.</p>
<p>At this time, there is one General Ma Zhanshan of Heilongjiang. Based on the duty of a soldier, with the bloodiness of a man, with the loyalty of loving the country, with the spirit of disregarding success or failure and not fearing death, he led a lone army to fight a desperate battle with the Japanese brutal army that invaded our province of Heihe. In the Battle of the Nenjiang Bridge, General Ma personally went to the front line to command the battle. The entire army was inspired by loyalty and fought desperately. One fell, another stepped into the breach. In the end, they were able to defeat the brutal army, making them know that our country still has soldiers who can fulfill their duties. This kind of heroic war to win glory for the nation is truly moving and worthy of praise. It is truly enough to put to shame the ordinary soldiers who did not resist and fled. However, according to the current situation, the Japanese army is still continuously increasing its reinforcements. General Ma, with his isolated army without any support, will ultimately not be able to hold out for long. But even this is enough to show General Ma's loyalty and bravery. The general is not unaware that the connection with Jiang Province has been cut off, that calls for support have not been answered, and that a lone army in a corner is not enough to defeat ferocious tigers and wolves. However, inspired by loyalty and righteousness, he does not fear death. In his telegram, the General stated: "Zhanshan has a responsibility to defend the territory. As long as there is a breath left, I will never allow even an inch of land to be lost to foreign races." He also said: "I have the responsibility to defend the territory. I should give my life on the battlefield and vow to fight to the death with the enemy and never return alive." Alas, this kind of sincerity is enough to move heaven and earth and make the gods weep. Even if Qiqihar is unfortunately lost in the end, it will only be a normal thing in the victory or defeat of military strategists. How loyal and brave is General Ma! How tragic and heroic is General Ma!</p>
<p>Our country spends more than 80 percent of the national budget on the army every year, supporting more than two million soldiers. However, at this time, with a great enemy at our doorstep and the country in danger, they have not been able to fulfill their duty to defend the country and protect the people. Now that we have this model of unwavering loyalty in General Ma, they should also know how to strive and know how to emulate. Let us not blame the past, but look forward to the future. The people of the country should now wait and see what happens next.</p>
<p>Domestic Important Telegrams Two</p>
<h3>Foreign Ministry Issues League of Nations Telegram</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Foreign Ministry released a telegram from League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond from Geneva stating, "To the Nanjing Foreign Ministry, in accordance with the instructions of the Chairman of the Executive Yuan, please forward the following telegram for your information: 'On November 6th, I, the Chairman, telegraphed to both the Chinese and Japanese governments through your office. Now that I have received replies from both governments, I, the Chairman, extend my gratitude to both governments through your office. After careful study of the replies and recent documents received, I believe I should solemnly declare again that both governments have previously promised to do their utmost to avoid any actions that would expand the situation. I, the Chairman, also strongly urge that the officers in command of the confronting armies be strictly ordered to refrain from any new actions. Finally, I, the Chairman, believe it is of utmost importance that facilities be provided to the inspection personnel sent by the member states of the Executive Yuan to the area, especially those sent to the Nenjiang Bridge and Angangxi to gather information as stipulated in the resolution of September 30th.' Chairman of the Executive Yuan, Briand. (13th Dispatch)"</p>
<h3>Foreign Ministry Telegraphs League of Nations Welcoming Neutral Personnel Investigation</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) On the 11th, the Foreign Ministry received a telegram from League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond relaying a telegram from Briand stating that no new actions should be taken and requesting that facilities be provided to the investigation personnel. The Foreign Ministry has now telegraphed a reply to the League of Nations Secretary-General, welcoming an investigation by neutral personnel, and requesting that it be forwarded to Mr. Briand. The text of the telegram is as follows: "The Chinese government has received Your Excellency's telegram forwarded yesterday from the Chairman of the Executive Yuan, and is very grateful to learn that Mr. Briand continues to be extremely concerned about the current situation in the Far East. The Chinese government, apart from having no choice but to take necessary defensive measures against further deliberate attacks by Japan, will strictly avoid any military actions. However, the current situation is becoming increasingly serious due to Japan's continued expansionist actions. For example, at the Nenjiang Bridge in Heilongjiang Province, the Japanese army is concentrating and has declared its intention to seize the provincial capital, Qiqihar. Its commander even demanded that Chairman Ma of the provincial government hand over political power to Zhang Haipeng, a traitorous leader who is cooperating with the Japanese army. Furthermore, recently the Japanese have been engaging in various secret disruptive conspiracies in various parts of China. The events that have already occurred in Tianjin are entirely the result of Japanese planning and direction, and the Japanese barracks and concessions are being used as bases for their disturbances, causing even greater anxiety among Chinese and foreign people. Under these circumstances, the Chinese government sincerely hopes and welcomes neutral observers to go to the areas where the Japanese army is operating in order to obtain accurate information, especially to the Nenjiang Bridge and Angangxi in Heilongjiang, and to Tianjin and other important locations. The Chinese government will provide all necessary facilities to the observers to enable them to complete their tasks. Please forward the above documents to the Chairman of the Executive Yuan."</p>
<h3>Shi Zhaoji Reports to the League of Nations on Japanese Seizure of Mines and Private Fabrication of Deeds</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Chinese Chief Representative Shi today reported to the Council that the Japanese authorities sent small squads of soldiers carrying machine guns to forcibly seize important mines of the Northeast Mining Company, and dispatched Japanese personnel as advisors to various locations of the company, forcing Chinese employees to continue working under Japanese management, mining 250,000 tons of anthracite coal annually. He requested that Council President Briand ask the Japanese government to instruct the Japanese ambassador to return the company's mines to their legitimate original owners, so as to prevent the situation from becoming more serious. He also stated that the Japanese military authorities had previously taken blank documents from the Liaoning and Jilin provincial government offices, and are now privately filling them out to issue land deeds and mining licenses, thereby furthering the Japanese plot to seize property. In Shenyang alone, more than two thousand landowners have lost their property without cause. For example, the Xinghe Agricultural Society (transliteration) is one of the organizations created after the Japanese army occupied the area. Recently, after enclosing land, they notified the original Chinese landowners that if they cultivated the society's land without permission, they would have to sign new contracts with the society within a specified period, otherwise the land would be rented to others. Thus, the Japanese occupation not only expands the occupied areas, but also increases Japanese private property. While claiming to protect the lives and property of Japanese residents, they initially used Mongol bandits and other unscrupulous elements, and added Japanese advisors to various banks and business organizations, thereby undermining the original Chinese organizations and local governments. Later, they seized salt taxes, destroying foreign debt guarantees, and now they are forging land deeds, etc. (12th National Telegram)</p>

<h3>Shi Zhaoji Submits Emergency Note to the League of Nations Reporting Honjo's Ultimatum</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Chinese Chief Representative Shi today sent an emergency note to the Council, reporting that Japanese Army Commander Honjo sent a written ultimatum to Ma Zhanshan, the acting chairman of Heilongjiang Province, this afternoon, demanding that the Heilongjiang provincial government resign and immediately cede Qiqihar. He requested that Briand immediately intervene to prevent the Japanese army from taking further military action, stating that the Japanese are now about to occupy Qiqihar and the Tao'ang Railway. The Chinese army led by General Ma Zhanshan has retreated to Shanshanfang (transliteration), 17 miles from Dasing Station. Dasing Station is currently occupied by the Japanese army. If the Japanese continue to advance in violation of their commitments to the Council, a major war could break out at any time. Before sending the emergency note, Chief Representative Shi had informed League of Nations Secretary Drummond that the situation at Nenjiang was extremely dangerous, and that 4,000 Japanese soldiers were advancing on General Ma Zhanshan. At 10:00 p.m. on the 10th, several Japanese aircraft bombed Chinese military camps, killing and wounding several soldiers. Shi and Drummond discussed the matter for about 40 minutes in the evening, and afterwards stated that he had notified the League of Nations Secretariat of the most serious news, that the Japanese army, after reinforcements arrived, had sent an ultimatum to General Ma Zhanshan, threatening to attack with full force. (12th National News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today, Chinese Representative Dr. Shi reported to the League of Nations Secretariat that Japanese Army Commander Honjo sent an ultimatum to Ma Zhanshan at noon today, ordering him to immediately withdraw from Qiqihar. The Chinese troops have retreated to Sanzhenfangzi, which is now occupied by the Japanese army. He requested that Council President Briand immediately restrain Japan. If the Japanese army carries out the intentions recently expressed by the Japanese government to the Executive Council, war will break out at any time. Council President Briand issued a note to China and Japan, urging them to respect their promises and refrain from any actions that would aggravate the situation. He also stated that the Executive Council will send personnel to Manchuria for inspection, and that both sides must provide all kinds of facilities. Geneva observers believe that the proposal to send personnel for inspection is a key diplomatic move, and the direction of next week's Executive Council meeting can be gleaned from this. Because the reports from both sides differ, and the members of the Executive Council seem unwilling to adopt coercive measures, in this situation, the intervention of a neutral party to investigate can save the critical situation and prevent the expansion of the war. China has now prepared for the arrival of inspectors. Dr. Shi stated that the Chinese Reception Committee was established on November 1st, with Gu Weijun as the chairman, to discuss the withdrawal of troops from the three northeastern provinces with Japan. The Chinese committee will request that representatives of the great powers cooperate closely with the Chinese committee. Dr. Shi also issued a document accusing the Japanese of forcibly seizing Chinese mines and land. The Japanese representative today sent a document to the League of Nations Secretariat, describing the banditry in Manchuria in great detail, stating that in order to effectively protect Japanese residents living in the interior, the existing force of 14,400 men is insufficient, so it is necessary to withdraw the Japanese and Korean residents along the railway into safe areas. However, many Koreans are unwilling to abandon their agricultural products and prefer to remain in their original locations. In order to perform its duty of monitoring the situation and protecting residents, the Japanese army has no choice but to station troops outside the railway zone at Zhengjiatun, Juliuhe, and other places in Jilin, and dispatch detachments from these three locations when necessary to drive out bandits and scattered soldiers. The railway zone is wide, so it is necessary to dispatch armored trains and aircraft. However, the Chinese claim that the Japanese aircraft are flying bombing missions, intending to sensationalize world opinion. The Japanese document also stated that the Chinese authorities are using bandits to attack the Japanese railway, causing the Japanese great losses. Since the incident in September, banditry has become rampant. From mid-September to October 27th, there have been a total of 577 bandit attacks. In addition to detailing the banditry in various places, the Japanese document also includes statistics. (12th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Japanese Government Replies to Briand's Note, Shifting Responsibility for the Nenjiang War</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding President Briand's new note yesterday urging avoidance of hostile acts, Foreign Minister Shidehara today instructed Mr. Sawada, Director-General of the Japanese Bureau, to reply to Mr. Briand as follows: The Japanese troops stationed near the Nenjiang Bridge have received instructions not to expand military operations if the Chinese troops do not engage in combat. This point was clearly stated in my reply to Your Excellency the President on November 8th. The following events have been repeatedly reported by the Japanese Director to the Council: the Chinese side has concentrated forces more than ten times greater than the Japanese army in Qiqihar, Angangxi, and south of there. I would like to draw Your Excellency the President's deep attention to this kind of threat to the Japanese army. The Japanese government can provide the Council with various information in accordance with paragraph 7 of the September 30th resolution. Japan will provide as much convenience as possible to the officials of the Council members who go to Manchuria for inspection after the occurrence of this incident. However, as mentioned above, Japan's attitude has not changed in the slightest. (13th Japan United News Agency Telegram)</p>
<h3>Japan Reinforces Shenyang and Demonstrates with Artillery Fire in Shenyang</h3>

Minami replied that troops would be increased after the army exercises were completed. (13th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<h3>Japan Increases Air Force Strength in Dong Province</h3>

(13th National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Soviet Policy Remains Unchanged, Russian Newspaper Denies Imperialist Rumors</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The Russian newspaper Rabochaya today stated that Russia is only adopting a policy of observation and neutrality regarding the Sino-Japanese dispute. The newspapers of British, American and French imperialism, disregarding Russia's categorical denials, are still spreading rumors that Soviet Russia is sending troops to Manchuria to help the Chinese army. It is important to know that the Soviet working class is now closely monitoring the events in the Far East. The Russian people do not want war, but are prepared to deal harshly with provocateurs. (12th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Under Japanese Influence, Bandits Run Rampant in Jilin Province</h3>
<p>(Beiping) A person from Jilin reported that the opinions of the provincial committee members below Xi Qia are quite inconsistent. Bandits are running rampant in the counties. For a time, there was a rumor in Yushu, Shulan, and Panshi counties that there were no virgins or chaste women in the villages on both sides of the road. Yitong County was captured by bandits on the 5th and is still occupied. The fierce bandit Zhongliexia sank a Dehui County warship on the Songhua River, drowning more than 130 members of the security team. The temporary office of the Jilin Provincial Government will be moved to Bin County. The 34th Regiment of Ma Zhanhai's troops has arrived there to defend it. The director of the education bureau has appointed Rong Mengmei to serve. Xi Qia is currently recruiting soldiers. About a thousand people have responded, all wearing yellow serge military uniforms, military hats, and red hatbands. At first glance, they almost look like Japanese soldiers. They are named the Garrison Team and stationed at the old site of the 34th Regiment outside Deshengmen. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>German People React Negatively to Eastern Newspaper Republishing Okuma's Essay</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Recently, the Japanese Times published an essay by former Japanese Prime Minister Okuma. The essay was written by Okuma in 1921 and was published in newspapers. It stated that Japan's request that China recognize the Twenty-One Demands was originally intended to prevent China from joining the German-Austrian alliance in the European War. Berlin opinion is quite angry and surprised by the reprinting of this essay. Berlin political circles have declared that Okuma's remarks are groundless. Chinese President Yuan Shikai did not collude with Germany or Austria, and the exchange of correspondence with the former German Kaiser was because Qingdao and the entire province of Shandong were already in Japanese hands, so even if China wanted to join Germany and Austria, it would have been impossible. Moreover, Yuan Shikai repeatedly proposed to the Allies that China declare war on Germany and join the Allies, but the Allies ignored it. Today, it is pointless and ridiculous to try to link the Twenty-One Demands incident to Germany's political actions during the European War. (12th National News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Approximately 300 students from various schools in Tianjin, including the Faculty of Law and Commerce, Women's Normal College, Vocational School of Fisheries, Rotary Middle School, Zhenzhong Middle School, Zhongshan Middle School, Jiuzhen Middle School, and Nankai Middle School, organized a petition delegation to petition in Nanjing. Today (the 13th) at 11:00 AM, they gathered at the Central University to petition the Fourth National Congress. Five representatives were first selected to explain their intentions to the staff of the Congress's Public Relations Section. Subsequently, they were received by Secretary-General Ye Chucang, and the representatives presented the main points of their petition and provided detailed explanations: (1) Organize a unified government to jointly resist foreign aggression; (2) Establish a National Defense Conference to consolidate national sovereignty and territory; (3) Actively prepare for war against Japan; (4) Enforce economic severance and order local governments not to interfere; (5) Restore the people's movement; (6) Expand international propaganda to achieve the goal of uniting with other nations in the world who treat us equally to fight together; (7) Based on the spirit of governing the country by the Party, delineate the powers of the Party, government, and military; (8) Clearly stipulate the people's legal obligations and rights and guarantee them; (9) Concentrate national talents. They also inquired about the simultaneous holding of the Fourth Plenary Session in Nanjing and Guangzhou. Finally, they requested the central government to (1) order the authorities in Hebei and Tianjin not to obstruct or resist the movement to boycott Japanese goods; (2) severely punish historical traitors; (3) move the deposed Emperor Puyi away from the Japanese concession in Tianjin to prevent him from being used by the Japanese. After the representatives finished their presentations, Ye Chucang stood up and replied, stating that before answering, two points should be clarified: (1) He was responding in his capacity as Secretary-General of the Congress; (2) The requests would be presented to the Presidium for submission to the Congress. He mentioned that some of the points raised were already being addressed by the Congress. The previous Shanghai talks had yielded results on the principles for improving Party affairs, government administration, and diplomacy, which had been disclosed in the newspapers and were known to everyone. As for the holding of the Fourth Plenary Session in two locations, it was a compromise by the central government to find the best way to end past disputes and achieve the goal of peaceful unification. The central government had initially hoped to hold it together, but the Guangdong comrades disagreed, so it was held separately. However, if everyone's sole purpose was to save the country, even if the Congress was held separately, the results would converge because the Shanghai talks, the Fourth Plenary Session, and the future Fourth Central Executive Committee were all moving towards the realization of a unified government. The organization of the National Defense Conference was, in principle, the government's duty, but the detailed arrangements could not be answered immediately. Restoring the people's movement and expanding the people's movement were essentially the same thing, and in fact, it had already been restored. Furthermore, if Japan did not comply with the League of Nations' resolution to withdraw its troops by the 16th of this month, further measures would be taken, which went without saying. As for the previous propaganda work, it was indeed not done well, but this time, there seemed to be more materials available, which was better than before, but not yet satisfactory. The representatives' suggestion was not so much a petition as a lesson to them. Regarding the issue of unification, they would spare no effort to make concessions to achieve it. Ye then went outside to meet with all the students and praised their spirit of enduring hardship and their patriotic fervor. Subsequently, everyone shouted in support of the Fourth National Congress of the Chinese Nationalist Party and then departed. (13th Dispatch)</p>

Central Committee members Chiang Kai-shek, Yu Youren, Dai Jitao, Chen Lifu, Lin Sen, Ye Chucang, and others also attended and led the ceremony, presenting wreaths and paying respects in the memorial hall before returning to the city. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The speech delivered by Chiang Kai-shek at the opening of the Congress was not fully published in yesterday's newspaper. The following is a continuation:</p>
<p>In the past, our Party not only lacked a spirit of unity but also disrespected discipline. This phenomenon occurred even when the Premier was alive. At that time, many comrades only wanted personal freedom and could not fight for the Party's freedom. They only wanted personal power and could not increase the Party's power. They even opposed the Premier's intentions and insulted the Premier's leadership. Therefore, in his later years, the Premier constantly instructed us to abide by discipline. I remember that the day before the Premier left Guangdong for Beiping in 1924, he told us that he was going to Beijing alone to fight the warlords and hoped that young students and Party members would remember that the most important thing was to "sacrifice personal freedom and contribute each individual's freedom and equality to the revolutionary party. The party's discipline must be observed, and the party's orders must be obeyed. Only the party is allowed to be free; individuals cannot be free. Only then can the revolution succeed." I remember that the Premier also said that the Chinese Nationalist Revolution, from the Tongmenghui to 1924, had not succeeded because everyone agreed today and could form a group, but tomorrow, if their personal interests clashed with the group's interests, they would not hesitate to destroy the group, attack the leader, and scatter the forces to pursue their personal interests. Now, when we think of the Premier's last words, all comrades must feel very pained. Since 1926, the power of all warlords and bureaucrats in the country has been gradually weakened by our Party. After 1928, the Party and the country were completely unified, but unexpectedly, internal disputes within our Party suddenly arose at this time, causing the unification cause to fail just before its completion. By this year, we have reached a state where internal troubles and foreign aggression, natural disasters, and man-made calamities are all pressing down on us simultaneously. Recalling the Premier's words that the revolutionary cause cannot be destroyed by enemies but is destroyed by our own Party, it truly makes us extremely saddened. After each revolutionary failure, the Premier always instructed comrades to examine their own mistakes and find the root cause of the failure. Today, as the Fourth Plenary Session opens here, the Central Committee members feel very ashamed of the past achievements. Even if our comrades across the country do not blame us, how can we forgive ourselves? However, today's internal troubles and foreign aggression, natural disasters, and man-made calamities are truly unprecedented national crises. Not only are the Central Committee members failing in their duties, but even if we combine the talents and efforts of all Party comrades to face the national crisis, we fear that our strength will be insufficient. Therefore, all Party members have a common feeling recently, which is that everyone feels that we must first unite internally and resolve the disputes within our Party before we can resist foreign aggression. As for how to achieve the Party's unity, the prerequisite is naturally mutual love and sincerity, but at the same time, we must not harm the Party's basic organization. Therefore, the comrades attending the Fourth Plenary Session bear a great responsibility. Everyone must, without violating the Party Constitution and the Premier's instructions, use the Congress's common will to study how to unite comrades. If we cannot come up with a truly united method, not only will we be invaded and oppressed by Japan, but the future of the entire Chinese nation will be unimaginably dangerous. This Congress is the Party's highest authority meeting. Everyone must, without betraying the Party's discipline and the Congress's dignity, promote the Party's spiritual unity to jointly resist foreign aggression. In short, the two most important missions of this Congress are (1) to unite internally and (2) to resist foreign aggression. This mission is even more important than the two major missions of reorganizing the Party and transforming China that were carried out when the First National Congress was held. To shoulder this major responsibility, I believe we must pay attention to two things: one is revolutionary morality, and the other is revolutionary spirit. What is revolutionary morality? At a time when the revolution is in danger of failing and the nation's faith in our Party is gradually being lost, and when an unprecedented national crisis is testing our revolutionary morality, we must sacrifice personal freedom, respect the Party's discipline, obey the Congress's common will, and demonstrate the highest morality of a revolutionary party. What is revolutionary spirit? It is what the Premier said: to have the spirit of sacrificing oneself for righteousness, sacrificing everything, including life, for the country and the nation. At this time, we must have the spirit of leading the people to sacrifice themselves for the country in order to save our national destiny. In other words, we must not be negligent or wavering in the slightest. We must devote all our efforts to where righteousness leads us and base everything on the great cause of the revolution. If we can restore this revolutionary morality and revive our revolutionary spirit, then all the work of resisting foreign aggression and uniting internally will surely be realized. If all comrades can regard the Party and the country's interests as their own, I believe that no problem within the Party cannot be resolved, and no differences or right and wrong cannot be resolved with our sincerity. Uniting as one is naturally not a problem, and the Party and the country's future will naturally be bright and consolidated. We unanimously believe that Party unity is our only way out at present, because objective facts cannot but lead us to this conclusion. We propose that past disputes should be resolved with the spirit of solidarity between comrades that the Premier spoke of. As long as it does not violate the Party Constitution and the Premier's instructions, we should make every effort to achieve our unity, no matter what. This does not mean that the Central Committee disregards everything in the past and casually destroys the Party's system. Now, with the national crisis at hand, all our representative comrades must know that (1) Japan's tyrannical aggression is expanding day by day, and (2) after the floods and banditry, the people are already living in misery. Recently, under the double pressure of internal and external troubles, not only the people of the Northeast provinces are suffering greatly, but all compatriots across the country are in extreme hardship. The social economy and the people's livelihood have reached the point of bankruptcy. We should study how to resolve this difficult situation in our Congress. According to the current revolutionary environment, if we want to save the country, the only way is to unite internally; if we want to save the Party, the only way is to unite internally; and if we want to deal with external issues, we must especially unite internally. Revolution requires strategy. With the national crisis at hand, we must study whether it is more important to resolve external issues or internal issues. If we want to be unyielding and uncompromising externally, the only way is to seek unity internally. If we are unwilling to make concessions internally, then we will not be able to make progress externally. Not only will we not be able to make progress, but the effects of dealing with external and internal issues will be completely inversely proportional. I believe that if we can take a step back internally, we can take ten steps forward externally. If we insist on taking a step forward internally, the result will inevitably be a complete failure externally. This is an inevitable law. The representative comrades must be able to examine the environment of our Party and the country and make appropriate decisions. The Premier told us that our Party members must take uniform steps, obey the Party, advance together, and retreat together. The spirit of unity of our revolutionary party lies in advancing and retreating together and sharing life and death. The Party's life and the Party members' lives are one, and the Party's mission is to revolutionize and save the country. We talk about unity and tolerance for the sake of revolutionizing and saving the country. Therefore, we believe that the realization of unity should be promoted by sacrificing everything, but it should not violate the Party Constitution and the Premier's instructions, nor should it violate the public will of the Fourth Plenary Session. Otherwise, if only a part of the goal of unity is achieved while the spirit and discipline of the entire Party are damaged, it will be of no benefit to the Party or the country. In short, I sincerely hope that the representative comrades of the Congress will recognize our environment and facts, and under the premise of protecting the Party's foundation and not betraying the Party's discipline, realize our unity and resist the unprecedented foreign aggression, so as not to let down our Premier and martyrs, and to be worthy of all Party comrades and compatriots across the country. I sincerely wish the Congress success. (13th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Black Army Inflicts Heavy Damage on Japanese寇</h3>
<p>Anti-Aircraft Guns Shoot Down Enemy Plane, Garrison Troops Shell and Kill Many Japanese Troops</p>
<p>│The First Victorious Battle of Our National Army in the Afternoon of 甲│</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: The Japanese army, coercing Zhang Haipeng's rebel forces, launched a large-scale invasion of Heilongjiang. Their intention towards the Black Army was to annihilate them in a single blow, because the Black Army's equipment was outdated and their supplies were inadequate. Compared to the elite troops of Liaoning, they were worlds apart. Therefore, on the 4th, they used heavy troops to pressure Jiangqiao Station, originally hoping to scare away the Black Army without bloodshed, and to cover Zhang Haipeng's entry into Heilongjiang, making him the general they had envisioned. Who would have known that things would turn out so differently? Since the outbreak of hostilities on the 4th, the Japanese army successively increased to two brigades and three regiments, totaling eight to nine thousand men, plus more than seven thousand of Zhang Haipeng's rebel troops, bringing the total force to fifteen or sixteen thousand men, with as many as thirty artillery pieces, and the advantage of more than twenty aircraft. After three days of fierce fighting, they failed to advance even a step beyond Daxing Station, and eventually suffered a defeat and fled in disarray. This was truly an unexpected and unprecedented humiliation for the "Imperial Royal Army." According to military experts, the defeat of the Japanese troops this time was due to the Black Army's extreme courage and determination, with each soldier fighting to the death. However, the arrogance and complacency of the Japanese troops, who did not take our army seriously, was also a cause of their defeat. At a time when the whole country feared Japan like a tiger, the Black Army, under the command of Ma Zhanshan, was able to confront the enemy for several days with a few isolated troops stationed outside the Great Wall, wiping away the great shame of the national army being inferior to the enemy for the past thirty years. This is truly admirable. If all the officers and soldiers in the country were like Ma Zhanshan,</p>
<p>inspired by the bravery of the Black Army, expelling the violent Japanese would not be difficult. The following is an account of the Black Army's heavy defeat of the Japanese寇:</p>
<p>On the 6th, at around 3 p.m., the Japanese troops, besieged by our army, used hand-held machine guns and hand grenades as a vanguard, charging desperately. The aircraft flew very low in the sky, dropping bombs accurately, causing our cavalry line to shift slightly. The Japanese troops then rushed out like wolves and pigs, breaking out of the encirclement and leaving. At around 4 p.m., the Japanese side used two aircraft, taking turns dropping bombs to harass us. Our army did its best to cope until sunset, when the aircraft left, and our army was able to rest. There were no fortifications or villages nearby, making it difficult to supply provisions. Fortunately, the merchants of Ang'angxi and Qiqihar, moved by righteous indignation, made noodles and dry rations, which were transported by cars, and our army was able to fill their stomachs. After 9 p.m., a large force of Japanese troops attacked again. The soldiers fixed bayonets and charged, shouting and killing. Zhang Haipeng's two sons and the commander of the sixth regiment each supervised their troops, encircling from the left and right wings. The terrain was a vast plain, ideal for cavalry. Zhang's Mongol bandits displayed their superb control skills, using one horse and three guns, firing continuously, causing our army considerable trouble. The soldiers fought individually, and those without bayonets on their guns used their gun butts to block and repel the enemy, fighting bravely. Enemy soldiers with broken chests and dragging intestines fell from their horses in heaps. The newly formed garrison army brigade was particularly experienced in combat, firing mortars fiercely, scattering the enemy's dense formations. The enemy lost coordination, and our army took advantage of the situation to sweep with infantry machine guns, causing the enemy to retreat slightly and switch to artillery bombardment. Our garrison army was originally reorganized from the famous artillery brigade of the Northeast, and their aim was very accurate. They fired mountain guns and anti-aircraft guns in direct fire, hitting the target accurately, and the enemy also suffered considerable losses. By 1 a.m. on the 7th, the artillery bombardment gradually subsided, and our army also ceased firing back. At this time, Zhang Dianjiu's troops of the Black Army rushed from Zhalantun, increasing their strength and boosting morale. After 5 a.m., the Japanese army launched a dawn attack, using cavalry to detour to Daxingtun and Xiaoxintun, to take our rear. Our army took the opportunity to feign a retreat of twenty li, pre-positioning artillery at Sanjianfang and Huluxi Station. The Japanese army and Zhang's rebel troops did not realize this and bravely pursued. Our artillery then took advantage of the high ground to launch a fierce bombardment. It is said that this battle killed more than 600 Japanese soldiers, and the death toll among Zhang's rebel troops was even higher, at more than a thousand. Nine Japanese aircraft came to support, circling overhead and dropping bombs. They flew extremely low, and the garrison troops set up anti-aircraft guns in direct fire, firing into the air, and shot down one of the aircraft. The other aircraft, thinking that our army had anti-aircraft guns, did not dare to linger and flew away. With the Japanese army losing support, our army was able to calmly counterattack. By about 10 a.m., the Japanese army and Zhang's rebel troops had suffered more and more casualties, and dared not continue fighting, retreating in disarray to the left of Jiangqiao, fleeing about fifty li, with corpses strewn across the field and countless supplies abandoned. Our army then pursued to Jiangqiao Station, still firmly defending the original defense. The fighting stopped at noon. Black Chairman Ma Zhanshan rushed from the provincial capital to the front to comfort the troops, encourage the soldiers, and comfort the wounded. He also designated the area from Jiangqiao Station in the south to Xinlitun and in the north to Daguantun as the first line of defense, defended by Wu Songshan's brigade with two regiments of garrison troops. Daxing Station, Sijiazi, and Sanjianfang were designated as the second line of defense, defended by two infantry regiments of Zhang Dianjiu's troops and one infantry regiment of garrison troops. Xiaoxintun and Huluxi were designated as the third line of defense, and two regiments of Su Bingwen's brigade and one cavalry regiment of Cheng Zhiyuan's brigade have been transferred to defend it. The defenses are extremely tight and the communication is appropriate. Example Diagram: "Our Army's Defense Line After the Battle"</p>
<p>to prepare for the enemy's return. The Black Province's combat-ready troops have now been mostly transferred to the front, and the defenses along the Eastern Railway's Harbin-Manchuria line are inevitably empty. Ma Zhanshan specially obtained Ding Chao's agreement to transfer the 661st Regiment of the 22nd Brigade of the Jilin Army under Su Dechen from the Harbin-Changchun line, and the 2nd and 3rd battalions of infantry to Ang'angxi Station, and the 1st Battalion of the 674th Regiment of the 26th Brigade of Xing Zhanqing to Zhalantun Station, and the 1st Battalion of the 679th Regiment of the 28th Brigade of Ding Chao to Fularji Station, to replace the Black Army in protecting the railway. Currently, the people of Harbin are overjoyed by the Black Army's defeat of the violent Japanese寇this time, and have launched a campaign to comfort the troops, collecting funds to purchase goods to send to the front to comfort them.

<h3>Panic in Tianjin Not Abated</h3>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: This reporter went to Zhang Mayor Xueming's private residence on No. 17 Road in the Special Area No. 1 on the afternoon of the 10th to interview him. It was then learned that the provincial and municipal authorities were all working in Hebei, so he drove straight to Hebei. The following is a draft of this dispatch based on the information obtained from the interview.</p>
<p>Visiting the Municipal Public Security Bureau, the reporter passed through British Central Street in the Special Area No. 1, and there was nothing unusual, except that there were fewer pedestrians and vehicles. Passing through Central Street in the French Concession, four tanks were glimpsed parked in front of the French Army Headquarters. Entering the Special Area No. 3 through the Wanguo Bridge, there were double guards everywhere, and the pedestrians were as sparse as the morning stars, and looking around, their faces showed panic. Entering the Italian Concession, the intersections connecting the east with Special Area No. 3, the intersections connecting the west with Special Area No. 2, and the area along the river in the south, were all piled with earthbags, set up with electric nets and machine guns, and guarded by foreign sailors with guns. These sailors wore green uniforms and steel helmets. The Public Security Bureau is directly across the river from Special Area No. 2. Japanese soldiers and plainclothes agents fired at the Public Security Bureau day and night. Many stray bullets fell into Special Area No. 2. Although there were no casualties among the residents, many glass doors and windows were broken, and every household was closed, resembling a New Year's scene. Both ends of the Dongfu Bridge and in front of the Public Security Bureau were piled with sandbags, each guarded by more than a dozen members of the security team with guns. Entering the Public Security Bureau, the inspection was very strict. It happened that Wu Yixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau (and Secretary-General of the Public Security Bureau), was working inside. According to Wu, the mayor came to the bureau this afternoon to interrogate the plainclothes agents, and one of them had been executed and his head displayed to the public. There are still more than 100 Northeastern refugee students in the Caojia Building in Special Area No. 2 who have not found suitable schools. Due to the curfew, they have been without food for two days. I have just issued them 50 yuan to temporarily maintain their lives. The Japanese in the Yuda Cotton Mill, a Japanese business in Xiaoliuzhuang, Special Area No. 1, have fled into the Japanese Concession last night. The factory has suspended work today, and more than 3,000 workers have immediately lost their jobs. In this time of terror, adding this hidden worry, there is no way to provide relief for the time being. On the morning of the 9th, Japanese soldiers bombarded the Public Security Bureau with mountain guns. It has now been ascertained that one shell landed on the top floor of the Engineering Department of the Second Telephone Bureau, destroying the roof. One shell landed in the Tonghecheng Dye Shop on Yanghuo Street, destroying the awning. One shell also landed in front of the Public Security Bureau, but did not explode. It was one foot long, with a circumference diameter of four inches, and had the words "Made in the 5th Year of Taisho" on it. According to the report of the security police who were guarding at the time, there were also three artillery shells that landed in the river by the Dongfu Bridge, and people are being hired to salvage them, but they have not yet been retrieved. Also recovered were bullets fired from the Japanese Concession, with the words "Made by Han Linchun" on them. This type of bullet was manufactured by the Three Eastern Provinces Arsenal in the 11th year of the Republic of China, and was stored in the warehouse unused. Now it has suddenly been discovered in this incident. This proves that after the Japanese army occupied Shenyang, they transported the guns and ammunition from the Three Eastern Provinces Arsenal to Lushun. Because in the late last month, a Japanese merchant ship (the date and name of the ship are no longer remembered) sailed from Lushun, loaded with more than seventy boxes of munitions on the 4th. After arriving in Tianjin, it was unloaded into the Japanese barracks. On the 5th of this month, the Japanese ship Tenchomaru also loaded more than three hundred boxes of munitions from Lushun and unloaded them into the Japanese barracks in Tanggu. At that time, the Japanese side used the excuse of military supplies to refuse customs inspection. Although the Japanese authorities have repeatedly denied secretly assisting the plainclothes agents, the artillery shells and bullets are conclusive evidence, and the facts are the most eloquent. I am afraid that it will be impossible to conceal them in the end. After Wu finished talking, he hurried away from the bureau. Suddenly, several gunshots were heard, originating from the gate of the Japanese Concession. The bullets flew through the air with a whooshing sound. The reporter felt that he could not stay for long, so he got into the car and went through Shuige Street, turning into Dongma Road. In the Dahu District of the Guanyinhao area, where vehicles and horses were usually noisy and carriages were connected, the merchants were now tightly closed and no pedestrians were seen. Entering the provincial government through the Jingang Bridge, he was inspected five or six times along the way.</p>
<p>Visiting the Provincial and Municipal Governments, the reporter entered the provincial government and submitted his card to the transmission office to request an audience with Chairman Wang Shuchang. He was received and, according to Wang, the riot by the plainclothes agents was planned and organized. If they did not rely on the secret assistance of foreigners in the concession, where would they get so many guns and bullets? Although local order has been disrupted by these people, fortunately, the police and security forces have been able to cope calmly, loyally and dutifully. As a provincial official, I have the responsibility to defend the territory and will never be intimidated. Commander-in-Chief Jiang sends telegrams every day to inquire about the situation, instructing me and Mayor Zhang to defend strictly. Deputy Commander Zhang also gives instructions on the situation by long-distance telephone from time to time. The plainclothes agents rely on the secret assistance of a certain country and their actions are erratic, but they are an undisciplined rabble and have not received military training. If they do not rely on the protection of the concession, even if there were three or five thousand more of them, they would be easily suppressed. The reporter took his leave and went to the municipal government again, but heard that Mayor Zhang had not arrived and only Liu Bangban was working inside. He then went to the Beining Railway Bureau to visit Director Gao Jiyi. He learned that the Japanese destroyer Karukaya of the Lushun-based Japanese destroyer fleet, carrying more than 300 marines, had arrived in Tanggu at 1 p.m. today (the 10th). Because the Haihe River is shallow, they will sail to Tianjin when the tide rises tonight. He then went to the New Railway Station for inspection and saw soldiers of the 6th Company of the 2nd Battalion of the 654th Regiment of the 15th Brigade of the Northeast, responsible for station security. The tracks and bridges from the Old Station in the east to Beicang in the north were all patrolled by soldiers of that company. A row of Northeastern armored vehicles was parked on the platform, led by Captain Zhao Liangbi with more than 300 soldiers, responsible for the road protection mission between Pingjin. Rumors were rife in the Hebei area, spreading that Japanese soldiers were scheduled to assist the plainclothes agents in a general attack on the Public Security Bureau and the provincial and municipal governments tonight (the 10th). The area had already been placed under martial law at 5 p.m. in advance, cutting off traffic. The personnel of the Beining Railway Bureau and the Tianjin Office of the Jinpu Railway also left work early at 4 p.m. The reporter, fearing that traffic would be cut off, dared not stay for long. On the way back, he turned to the Municipal Party Department for a look, but the staff had all left. He then got into the car and, after several inspections, entered the Wanguo Bridge. Passing by Lizhan, he saw four trucks carrying armed Japanese soldiers, about fifty or sixty of them, driving towards the French Concession. The reporter hurriedly ordered the driver to follow closely behind to see what was going on. However, the car drove extremely fast and disappeared after reaching the British Concession. He then returned home dejectedly. He then used the telephone to inquire in all directions, and only then did he learn that the Japanese soldiers had gone to the Dalian Pier in Special Area No. 1 to board small motorboats and sailed downstream. It can be inferred that they must have been ordered by Japanese Commander Kashi to go to Tanggu to convey important matters to the Karukaya. Since the night of the incident, long-distance calls, except for the provincial and municipal government agencies, have all been suspended. The Japanese army also included the telephone to Tanggu in the suspension list.</p>
<p>The Disturbances of the Night of the 10th. Yesterday, rumors spread that Japanese soldiers were scheduled to assist the plainclothes agents in launching a general attack at 12 p.m. For the sake of preventing any eventuality, the provincial and municipal authorities ordered a special curfew and issued two hand grenades to the police in Special Areas 1, 2, and 3. At around 8 p.m., the Wanguo Bridge was pulled open, cutting off traffic. At night, dozens of Japanese soldiers took four small motorboats to patrol the Haihe River to demonstrate. After 9 p.m., gunshots were heard intermittently. At 11 p.m., the gunshots became tighter. At 12 p.m., the gunshots became even more intense, as dense as broken beads. This morning (the 11th), at 2 a.m., the sound of artillery boomed, still from the Japanese barracks in Haiguang Temple and the gate of the Japanese Concession. By 6 a.m., there were about twenty explosions in total. This afternoon, inquiring in all directions, it was learned that three or forty plainclothes agents were discovered inside Ximen at 11 p.m. last night and were dispersed by the police. In other places, such as Nankai Guangdeli, Yanghuqiao, Nantou Guantou, and Nanshi, groups of thirty to fifty plainclothes agents were discovered and were all routed by the security forces, and more than a dozen were captured. The plainclothes agents surrounded in Paotaizhuang Wandezhuang were suddenly relieved by dozens of Japanese soldiers this morning, who took the plainclothes agents into the Japanese Concession. The Sixth Sub-Bureau in the Second District has been guarded by Japanese military police. The municipal government is scheduled to protest to the Japanese consul this afternoon, demanding that the Japanese military police withdraw immediately. The Public Security Bureau, in response to the request of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, has allowed merchants and residents to go out to purchase food under police supervision and protection from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. Japanese Commander issued an order this morning that all Japanese women and children evacuate into the Japanese barracks, and all Japanese men went to the Veterans Association to await dispatch. Gunshots continue throughout the day today. Chinese territory will cut off traffic after 2 p.m. this afternoon, and the situation is still extremely dangerous. (Afternoon of the 11th)</p>
<h3>Serious Situation in Wuhan</h3>
<p>Nine Japanese Warships Arrive, Hull to Hull, The Garrison Command Has Advanced the Curfew Time</p>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: After the Japanese troops forcibly occupied Liaoning and Jilin, they again attacked Heilongjiang and disturbed Tianjin. The situation is becoming increasingly serious. Recently, the Yangtze River has also continued to increase troops, and the situation in the corner of Wuhan is particularly serious. Director He Chengjun of the Military Affairs Commission originally planned to go to Beijing to attend the Fourth Plenary Session, but was temporarily ordered by Commander-in-Chief Jiang to sit in Wuhan and has ceased to travel. At first, the Japanese sent warships to Wuhan one after another in the name of protecting overseas Chinese, including Hirado, Hira, Urakaze, No. 24, Hoz, and Kotaka, a total of six ships. Later, the Hoz, No. 24, and Hira were ordered to be transferred elsewhere and replaced by Hinoki, Hairokku, and Sumida. By 10 a.m. on the 9th, the 10,000-ton flagship Atago and two destroyers, Momokashi, also arrived in Hankou. Including the previous ships, there are a total of nine ships. Atago, Hirado, Sumida, Hairokku, Kotaka, Kashi, Momo, Hinoki, etc. were eight ships parked in the Japanese Concession Jiang surface. One Urakaze was moored along the river at the Six Pier of the Special Area No. 2. The hulls were connected to each other, the defenses were heavily guarded, and I really don’t know what their intentions are. Atago stationed Japanese Navy Commander Shiozawa, and all ships are under his command. After arriving in Hankou, he held secret meetings in the Japanese Concession with the captains of each ship and the consuls in Hankou, Chongqing, Chengdu and Zhengzhou. Overseas Japanese and vagrant people also seem to be receiving his hints, constantly provoking trouble. According to a certain source, the overseas Japanese recently received instructions from the Japanese government to arm themselves and seize opportunities to launch incidents, corroborating the previous rumors that the Japanese would riot in Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Hankou. It is not without reason. The people of Wuhan are extremely indignant at this violent invasion. However, upholding the government's intention to strive for peace and calm struggle, they are doing their best to avoid conflict. No matter how the Japanese provoke, they tolerate it as much as possible. Therefore, no accident has occurred. It is heard that the authorities recently held discussions, on the one hand, to do their best to protect the overseas Japanese, and on the other hand, to order the people to endure humiliation and bear burdens, so that the Japanese will never find an excuse. At the same time, the Garrison Command also issued a notice, starting from the 10th of this month, advancing the curfew time, cutting off traffic every night at 10 p.m. to avoid the mingling of petty criminals. As for the anti-Japanese movement, it is becoming increasingly tense due to the Japanese violence. The registration of Japanese goods by the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association ended on the 10th and the general inspection began. At 7 p.m. on the 10th, the association held an emergency meeting to discuss inspection methods and precautions for inspectors to avoid the Japanese provoking trouble, and invited the business community's trade associations to organize inspection teams to assist in the process. The measures have been drafted and a letter has been sent to each trade association for verification. (November 10)</p>

<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>The water police have suppressed bandits and rescued hostages. The Su-Xi water police rescued two persons, Yan Jisheng, who had been kidnapped on Maji Mountain, Taihu Lake. Yesterday, they rescued four persons: Ge Shi, Zhu Lisheng, Li Ahong, and Jin Aquan. All were kidnap victims from the Fei Yun Wheel. They were immediately sent back to Dongshan.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>The Wuxi Flood Relief and Reconstruction Association held its eighth cadre board meeting yesterday to discuss the approval of the provincial government to transfer the land tax for road construction to repair dike projects, and also County Chief Chen and Construction Bureau Chief Yao reported that the provincial department continued to send people to Wuxi to guard and collect the land tax for road construction. It was resolved that the local repair of dikes and relief works should be handled by the government. If the province can be responsible, as long as it does not deviate too much from the local plan, the funds raised locally may be handed over to the county and sent to the province for official management. If the provincial department cannot take care of it, then the local government, in view of the imminent disaster in Jiangbei, must take measures for itself. Even if the requested 50,000 yuan of land tax for road construction is transferred in full, it will still be far from enough. Before the provincial department has a definite plan for this case, Hua Yi’s Chen Zhanru should be contacted with Wuxi Jiaotong Bank, and the road construction donation stored in the Construction Bureau shall not be used without the notification of the association.</p>
<p>The League of Nations investigation team visits educational institutions.

We specially request your association to come to our province to collect and transport relief grain to alleviate the people’s food shortage. Our association is willing to do our best to help and provide you with the needs at a low price. Please consider and decide. It has been approved by the provincial relief association and consulted with the disaster-stricken counties in the province to follow suit and transport grain to regulate the food supply in the disaster areas for universal relief.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>A large number of bandits are sentenced separately.

<h3>Shaoxing</h3>
<p>A robbery and injury case occurred in the urban area. The Hengyu Qianzhuang in Xincheng Alley, Shaocheng, is located in a remote area. On the evening of the 11th, two robbers suddenly came. One guarded the door, and one robber entered to rob. Because he did not know where the silver was hidden, he forced him to point out where the silver room was. The clerk of the zhuang knew that they were bandits and replied that he did not know. The bandit immediately took out a sharp knife and stabbed the clerk in the head and fled. The police and military agencies were immediately notified and sent teams to arrest them, but it was too late.</p>

<h3>University Anti-Japanese Associations Appeal for Displaced Students from the Northeast</h3>
<p>The Anti-Japanese National Salvation United Association of University Students, considering that most of the students from the Northeast have been displaced and have nowhere to turn since the Japanese invasion of Shenyang, yesterday specially petitioned the government to provide relief as soon as possible, and telegraphed all schools across the country to find ways to accommodate them. The original text is recorded below:</p>
<p>A Petition to the National Government for Relief for Displaced Students from the Northeast: Since the violent Japanese soldiers invaded the Northeast, they have committed all kinds of atrocities, including rape, looting, and robbery. They are especially wary of cultural groups and educational institutions, causing much destruction by shelling schools and shooting students, resulting in hundreds of thousands of students in the Northeast being displaced. This not only wastes their studies but also harms the foundation of the country and goes against the principles of the government to encourage young people to study and save the country. Now, students from the Northeast are wandering around aimlessly. Although they have the heart to study, they have nowhere to go. They feel uneasy and cannot even talk about saving the country. If this continues, the future is worrying. Therefore, we have prepared a petition, hoping that you will review and approve it, and quickly accommodate and resettle the displaced young students from the Northeast to maintain the foundation of the country and plan for national affairs. The youth of the Northeast will be fortunate, and the future of the country will be fortunate. Respectfully presented to Chiang, Chairman of the National Government.</p>
<p>A Telegram to All Schools and Newspapers Across the Country, Forwarded to All Educational Institutions and Schools Across the Country: Since the violent Japanese occupied the Northeast, they have arbitrarily destroyed and worked hard to undermine cultural groups and educational institutions, shooting, shelling, and doing everything possible, causing students in the Northeast to be displaced. This not only wastes their studies but also harms the foundation of the country and goes against the original intention of the government to encourage young people to study and save the country. Considering this, our association dares to earnestly request that you find ways to accommodate them as soon as possible so that students in the Northeast will not suffer from the discontinuation of learning and the wandering of displacement. Our education will be fortunate, and the country will be fortunate. We respectfully telegram you.</p>
<h3>University Student Anti-Japanese Association Telegrams Requesting the Expulsion of Japanese Troops</h3>
<p>(National News Agency) The Anti-Japanese National Salvation United Association of University Students in this city, considering that the violent Japanese invaded Liaoning and Jilin, not only did not abide by the resolution of the League of Nations to withdraw troops by a deadline, but have recently intensified their efforts to invade Heilongjiang Province and disturb Tianjin, and if the Japanese troops do not withdraw after the deadline, troops will be dispatched to expel them from the country immediately. The telegram is recorded as follows: To the National Government of Nanjing: The fall of Liaoning and Jilin has angered the entire country. Our country, in order to maintain world peace, appealed to the League of Nations, hoping for fair arbitration. Therefore, the League of Nations had a resolution on November 16 that the Japanese troops must completely withdraw, which was announced to the world. Now that the time is pressing, the violent Japanese not only stated that they would never withdraw their troops, but also expanded their atrocities, attacking Heilongjiang Province and attacking Tianjin, and are actively plotting to disturb other important cities in our country and advocating joint management of China, deceiving the great powers. Their malicious intentions are outrageous. They despise the righteous advice of the League of Nations and undermine the credibility of the League of Nations. If our country is still an autonomous country, we should use iron blood and pledge to make a final struggle with perseverance. At that time, if the violent Japanese do not withdraw their troops, we respectfully ask the government to quickly send troops to drive the barbarians out of the country, defend our territory, wash away our humiliation, save China from sinking, and boost the prestige of China. The national crisis is imminent, and we are deeply saddened. (The rest is omitted.)</p>

<p>Soliciting Plans for Promoting Vocational Education</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Vocational Education Society sent letters to the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities, soliciting plans for promoting vocational education, reports, and lists of vocational schools. The original letter stated: Our society is dedicated to researching and promoting vocational education. Since the recent Japanese invasion of the Northeast, in order to fundamentally save the country, we feel more strongly the need to cultivate practical talents and increase production capacity. Our society has first enlisted experts to form a Vocational Education Promotion Design Committee, which, on the one hand, seeks future plans for vocational education from various places and investigates the current situation of vocational education in various places, and on the other hand, waits for the authorities in various places to raise questions and indicate to our society to carefully discuss and answer from both academic theory and facts for adoption. At the same time, the essentials will be publicly announced in the *Education and Vocational* monthly magazine for public viewing. We have long appreciated your bureau's enthusiasm for vocational education. In this time of national crisis, we would like to promote and implement it with greater efforts. We humbly request you to grant us the following three documents: 1. Your office's plans for promoting vocational education, or the entire education plan including the plan for promoting vocational education. 2. Your office's report on the current status of vocational education, or the entire report on the education situation including the report on the current status of vocational education. 3.

<h3>Municipal Circulating Library Opens</h3>
<p>The circulating library established by the Municipal Education Bureau of this city on the second floor of the City God Temple has gradually increased to more than 5,000 visitors per day since it opened last year. Because the library is narrow and insufficient, the library specifically asked the Municipal Education Bureau to borrow a room from the Yimiao Board of Directors. Later, it stopped opening from the 2nd of this month to add embellishments to the original library. It has been completed on the 11th and will be open for reading as usual on the 13th. Except for Mondays, it is open daily from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM. There are now two reading rooms in the library, and all kinds of books, magazines, and newspapers are displayed on the shelves, and readers can browse at will. All kinds of books can be freely borrowed outside the library for reading without any handling fees or restrictions on the number of times. A brief introduction will be sent immediately upon request.</p>

Requests for solicitation or donation from anti-Japanese associations, chambers of commerce, and various groups in this city and other places. 3. After the deadline for registration of Japanese goods in the school, all unregistered Japanese goods found will be confiscated and used for exhibition. The inspection department of the association has implemented various solicitation methods as determined and will be completed in the shortest possible time. At that time, it may be open to the public.</p>

<h3>Dongya Physical Education College Sports Meet Held in the Rain</h3>
<p>Those Who Won First Place in the Municipal Games Are Not Allowed to Participate</p>
<p>The Dongya Physical Education College in Lujiawan in this city was scheduled to hold a sports meet on the previous two days, as reported in this newspaper. Unexpectedly, the weather was not good, and it rained during the period. The school decided not to postpone it in order to train the students' physical fitness. Except for the field events, which could not be held due to excessive water accumulation on the field, the track events were still held. It rained all day, and there were very few guests. Male and female athletes each showed their bravery and competed bravely regardless of the rain. Their clothes were soaked, but they were not afraid and did not lose interest because no one was watching. After the reporter arrived at the scene, they did not see the two girls, Zhang Pingxian and Qian Xingsu, who won the first and second place in the overall score in the city's sports meet, which was quite strange. After inquiring, it was learned that in order to popularize and increase the interest of the second-class players, anyone who won first place in more than one sport in the city's sports meet was generally not allowed to participate. The results of the competition are recorded below:</p>
<p>Men's Group</p>
<p>100 Meters: Peng Guangxin, Dong Keyou, Dan Zhaorong, Yu Zhirui, 12 seconds</p>
<p>200 Meters: Lu Jingguang, Yu Zhirui, Dan Zhaorong, Dong Keyou, 24.8 seconds</p>
<p>400 Meters: Peng Xuemo, Miao Zhishan, Pei Langu, Li Feiran, 56 seconds</p>
<p>800 Meters: Zhang Dianxi, Miao Zhishan, Tan Xi, Lü Mingcheng, 2:20.4</p>
<p>1500 Meters: Zhang Dianxi, Lü Mingcheng, Hou Dechong, Liu Yongchang, 5:02.6</p>
<p>10000 Meters: Tan Xi, Huang Zizhen, Zhou Shujun, Ouyang Yingxue, 41:40.4</p>
<p>110-Meter Hurdles: Yuan Hanmin, Wei Rongtao, Lu Jialin, Bai Zhaosheng, 19.4 seconds</p>
<p>400-Meter Low Hurdles: Tang Zuozhou, Li Cunfu, Peng Guangxin, Xie Zhaosheng, 63 seconds</p>
<p>Women's Group</p>
<p>50 Meters: Lu Puzhen, Sheng Bi, Zheng Lixing, Zhang Shuxin, 7.4 seconds, breaking the school record</p>
<p>100 Meters: Liu Jingfang, Lu Puzhen, Ao Tianyun, Liu Baoshu, 13.8 seconds, tying the national record</p>
<p>200 Meters: Xia Fenlü, Mou Yuxrui, Ao Tianyun, Zhang Mingxia, 34 seconds</p>
<p>80-Meter Hurdles: Liu Jingfang, 16 seconds, tying the North China record</p>
<p>As the competition was about to end, Ms. Liu Jingfang requested to perform the 200 meters. The chief referee approved, and five or six people including Lu Puzhen accompanied her. Four watches were used to time. Ms. Liu was first, with a score of 28.8 seconds. Second was Lu Puzhen, with a score of 32.4 seconds. The results were excellent.</p>

<h3>All Circles Should Rise Up and Substantially Assist Heilongjiang Province</h3>
<p>Sending Telegrams of Condolences Is Not as Good as Providing Military Funds and Sending Aid</p>
<p>Since Ma Zhanshan, the Acting Chairman of Heilongjiang Province, adopted legitimate defense and repelled the Japanese invaders, all circles have been greatly encouraged and have sent telegrams of condolences. However, empty words, although enough to inspire morale, will not be a long-term solution without substantial assistance, considering the small number of hungry and tired national troops facing the rampant Japanese flames. Yesterday's proposals by Wang, Wu, Zou, and Wang deserve the deep attention of all Shanghai citizens and compatriots across the country.</p>
<h3>Telegram from Peace Conference Representatives Wang, Wu, and Zou</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Telegram to the Six Representatives of the Nanjing Peace Conference</p>
<p>Please Forward to Those in Charge the Idea of Legitimate Defense</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei, Wu Chaochu, and Zou Lu, the Guangdong representatives remaining in Shanghai for the peace and unification conference, jointly telegraphed yesterday to Cai Yuanpei, Zhang Ji, Zhang Jingjiang, Li Shizeng, Chen Mingshu, and Wu Tiecheng, the six representatives of the Nanjing peace conference, requesting them to forward the message to those in charge, urging them to quickly reinforce Ma Zhanshan. The original telegram is recorded below:</p>
<p>"To Representatives Cai Jiemin, Zhang Puquan, Zhang Jingjiang, Li Shizeng, Chen Zhenru, and Wu Tiecheng of Nanjing: Ma Zhanshan, Chairman of Heilongjiang, clearly upholds the meaning of defending the territory and fulfills the responsibility of safeguarding it. Compared to those who hold military power but abandon territory and those who do not resist foreign invasion, the difference is like heaven and earth. Recent reports indicate that Japan is increasing its troops to invade Heilongjiang, and Chairman Ma's situation is extremely dangerous. We request that you forward the message to those in charge to quickly send reinforcements, so as not to let patriotic and virtuous men be trapped in desperate situations. At the peace conference, the Guangdong representatives stated in the context of diplomatic unification that they could not agree with the policy of not resisting foreign invasion. The gentlemen also agreed that when foreigners invade our territory and we resist, international law recognizes this as legitimate defense, which is an absolutely legal action. We request that you quickly forward this and implement it, and please reply. Wang Zhaoming, Wu Chaochu, Zou Lu."</p>
<h3>Conversation with Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>We Should Do Our Best to Raise Funds to Assist</p>
<p>Do Not Let Heilongjiang Province Become the Second Tainan</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, stated that the Heilongjiang army is fighting bravely against the Japanese for the country, establishing extraordinary merits, and all sectors should urgently raise funds to help them, so as not to fail due to exhaustion of funds and lack of assistance. Yesterday, he issued a statement to the Xin Sheng News Agency, saying, "The Heilongjiang army has been confronting the violent Japanese at Nenjiang since the fourth day of the month, and it has been nearly ten days. The Japanese are increasing their troops and transporting weapons day by day, plotting a major offensive. Although the soldiers of that province are trying their best to support and fight hard, that province is the poorest of the three provinces. Recently, since the Tao'ang Road was blocked, the transportation of goods jointly operated by Bei'ning has been interrupted, commerce has been depressed, and income has decreased. Moreover, the Guangxin Official Silver Bank, on which the province relied for its funds, has had all its cash taken away by Wanguo Bin, so the shortage of military funds is almost certain. The soldiers of that province are fighting hard while enduring hunger, striving for the dignity of our nation. We, the people who are fortunate enough to be outside the battlefield, have not heard of any rescue efforts besides empty words of comfort. How can we face the soldiers who are dying in the front? The business community in Harbin has already raised 2 million to assist military funds. Overseas Chinese in the Philippines have also reportedly discussed raising funds to assist. This city seems unable to remain indifferent. We must remember the defense of Tainan by Liu Yanting in the year of Yiwu, which also failed due to exhaustion of funds and lack of assistance. The difficult and arduous situation is detailed in Yao Xiguang's "Eastern Military Records." In order to support Ma's righteous act of prioritizing territorial defense, we must not stand by and watch the fire from across the river, and let Heilongjiang Province become the second Tainan of that day. We should immediately unite and do our best to raise funds to assist, in order to solidify the morale of the army in that province, and let future generations know what to learn from."</p>
<h3>Important Telegram from the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of the Five Southeastern Provinces</h3>
<p>Telegraph Request to Vice Zhang, Yan, and Feng to Quickly Dispatch Large Troops to Reinforce</p>
<p>The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of the Five Southeastern Provinces sent two telegrams yesterday:</p>
<p>(1) Telegram to Ma, the Acting Chairman of Heilongjiang Province: "General Ma Zhanshan, under your command, after a long and silent night, we suddenly heard of your victory at Nenjiang, which revitalized the hearts of dying people. We have received telegrams every day, learning that the enemy is retaliating on a large scale, and our army is in a bitter battle. Looking north to the dark clouds, our hearts are filled with worry. The lives of the entire nation now depend on you. If you waver, it would be unbearable to imagine. We implore you to overcome danger as if walking on flat ground, and to die rather than leave, as a lesson to those soldiers who do not know how to defend against aggression, and to further deter the enemy. Our country's army has courage and knows the right direction, and is fully capable of fighting a battle, but it is only because the commanding generals are cowardly and willing to retreat, which leads to disaster. Our association, feeling the emptiness of the League of Nations meetings and the unfulfilled ambitions of the violent Japanese, telegraphed Vice Commander-in-Chief Zhang as early as last month, bitterly stating the righteousness of defending the territory and avenging the enemy, urging him to risk his life and leave the customs immediately to command the various armies and calmly respond to the battle, and also requesting that Generals Bai and Huan come out of retirement and unite against the enemy. Now we telegraph again, requesting that you quickly dispatch large troops to reinforce, so as not to let the general bear the brunt alone. We hereby telegraph our best wishes to the general, may China live forever, the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of the Five Southeastern Provinces."</p>
<p>(2) Telegram to Vice Commander-in-Chief Zhang in Beiping: "To Vice Commander-in-Chief Zhang Hanqing in Beiping: Since the outbreak of the Shenyang Incident, our association, feeling the emptiness of the League of Nations meetings and the unfulfilled ambitions of the Japanese enemy, telegraphed as early as last month, stating that the Japanese threat is deepening and the Central Plains are in turmoil. You, sir, have the responsibility to defend the territory for the country and the righteousness to avenge the enemy for the family. With the situation reaching this point, how can you tolerate it any longer? We implore you to risk your life and leave the customs immediately to command the various armies and calmly respond to the battle. If you win, you can become a hero for the world; if you lose, you can also leave a legacy for the ages. Generals Bai and Huan are experienced and steadfast, and we also request that you telegraph them to come out of retirement and unite against the enemy to defend against difficulties and save the country. Every man has a responsibility to swear to take up arms as a backing. It has been recorded. Now we hear that Ma Zhanshan, the Acting Chairman of Heilongjiang Province, has reported victory at Nenjiang, and the national prestige has spread far and wide, greatly boosting morale. Everyone eagerly hopes that you, sir, will not be Goujian, who tasted bitterness, but Cao Mo. This shows everyone's eagerness to avenge and the urgency of fighting. However, the enemy's cunning is becoming more apparent, and its progress is becoming more evident. The violent retaliation is worrying. The Ma brigade is in a difficult battle, responding calmly. The heart has more than enough, but the strength may not be enough. Once the clouds of war have opened, it is difficult to stop. Now the eyes of the entire nation are on the Ma brigade. If it wavers, the consequences will be dire. We implore you to rush to dispatch large troops to reinforce the front and to make a comprehensive war plan, defending every step of the way, to protect our country's territory, so that no single brigade will bear the brunt alone. Looking north, we bow our heads and beg you to make every effort. In addition to sending a special telegram to comfort General Ma Zhanshan, we hereby report this, the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of the Five Southeastern Provinces."</p>
<h3>Telegrams of Condolences from Party Departments and Labor Unions</h3>
<p>The First District Party Department telegraphed to various newspapers to forward to General Ma Zhanshan, the Acting Chairman of Heilongjiang Province: "When the Japanese bandits invaded, the whole country was shocked. Famous cities fell one after another, and Fengji was lost. Civil officials talked emptily about peace, and military men did not dare to resist. Alas, our beautiful rivers and mountains are allowed to be partitioned and become kingdoms. Only our general is loyal and brave, acting as the vanguard for the country and killing bandits. With a small number of isolated and weak troops, he faced tens of millions of ferocious wolves. In the Battle of Jiangqiao, the Japanese bandits were terrified, glorifying our national spirit and annihilating the enemy's ferocity. The five hundred of Tian Heng and the one brigade of Shao Kang will leave their names in history and serve as a lesson for thousands of years. We, the colleagues, look north to the clouds and mountains and are filled with admiration and excitement. We hereby send a telegram of condolences, hoping that you will cherish yourself for the country, the First Executive Committee of the Shanghai Special City Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party."</p>
<p>The Third District Party Department telegraphed: "The violent Japanese are invading, and there is no one to defend the territory. In a matter of days, ten thousand miles of land have been lost. Looking at the state of affairs, we cannot help but shudder. We have heard that you, sir, are fighting alone and have won a victory over the enemy, making the violent Japanese know that Qin is not without people. You are a pillar in the middle of the stream, and we are deeply impressed. We hope that you will continue to make persistent efforts and continue to fight. We respectfully send a telegram of condolences on behalf of all party members in the district. (The following is omitted)."</p>
<p>The Ninth District Party Department telegraphed to Ma, the Acting Chairman of Heilongjiang Province, and all the officers and soldiers: "After the violent Japanese invaded and occupied our Liaoning and Jilin, they continued to gain an inch after getting a foot, shelling Tianjin and invading Heilongjiang, with the intention of destroying our country and enslaving our people. Fortunately, our soldiers at the front are loyal and brave, and they are fighting hard against the enemy, sweeping away the strange shame of non-resistance in Liaoning and Jilin and strengthening the power of our country and nation. In addition to telegraphing the central government to order troops to reinforce, we hereby send a telegram of condolences, hoping that you will continue to work hard to be a pillar of the country and to comfort the nation's expectations, the Ninth Executive Committee of the Shanghai Special City Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party."</p>
<p>The Press Labor Union telegraphed to Ma, the Chairman of Heilongjiang: "The Japanese invaders have been invading for two months, and our Northeast territory is almost completely lost. There is no greater shame or humiliation. Recently, they have been mobilizing troops and increasing their weapons, intending to invade Heilongjiang. Fortunately, you, sir, are fighting alone and have won many battles, washing away the shame of the nation. The good news has been spread, and we deeply admire you. We hope that you will continue to make persistent efforts to annihilate the dwarfs and protect our borders. Our union will lead all members to support you and send our condolences. We hope you will consider this, the Shanghai Press Labor Union."</p>
<h3>Zhang Ji and Chen Mingshu Arrived in Shanghai on Orders to Visit Wang</h3>
<p>Wang Requested that the Central Government Quickly Study the General Amnesty Case</p>
<p>The Reform of the Political System Case Should Be Approved by the Fourth Plenary Session</p>
<p>The Conflict of the Two Parties' Proposals Has Been Resolved with Remedial Measures</p>
<p>Zhang Ji and Chen Mingshu, the Beijing representatives to the Beijing-Guangdong Peace Unification Conference, came to Shanghai on a special express train yesterday morning at about 8:00 a.m. on orders to discuss the telegrams issued by the Guangdong side when the Fourth National Congress of the Kuomintang was held. After getting off the train, they visited Wang Jingwei, the Guangdong representative, at his residence in the French Concession at about 9:00 a.m. and talked for about an hour. In addition to representing the central government and requesting the Guangdong side to issue a unified telegram in accordance with the general intention of the telegram issued by the Beijing side when the Fourth National Congress was held, they also reported the situation of the meeting held by the Beijing side's Fourth Plenary Session the day before, and expressed President Chiang's sincere attitude towards peaceful unification. Wang agreed to telegraph the Guangdong side according to their intention, and asked Chen and others to return to Beijing and quickly urge the central government to study the political amnesty case, so that all comrades of our country's party can unite as soon as possible to meet the expectations of the people. After Zhang and Chen left, a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency specially visited Wang for an interview. According to Wang, (1) Regarding the content of the meeting between Chen Zhenru and others in Shanghai, it is as described by the reporter above. (2) According to the fourth item of the proposal passed by the last meeting of the Peace Preparatory Committee, namely, "The first plenary meeting of the fourth session shall amend the Organic Law of the National Government and reorganize the government," this case, on the surface, seems to overturn the political system reform plan passed by the Preparatory Committee, and is instead decided by the first meeting of the fourth session. However, according to Wang, the one passed by the Preparatory Committee will be passed in the future, and then submitted by both parties for ratification when the Fourth Plenary Session discusses the proposal, which is equivalent to the one decided by the Preparatory Committee being approved by the Fourth Plenary Session in general. Therefore, there is no reason to overturn anything that has been passed by the previous Preparatory Committee. (3) Regarding the conflict of proposals in the Fourth Plenary Session of both parties, such as one case that the Beijing side can pass but the Guangdong side cannot pass, or the Guangdong side can pass but the Beijing side cannot pass, Wang said that this is inevitable in fact, but both parties have formulated a method, namely, the second item agreed upon at the last meeting of the Peace Preparatory Committee: "All proposals of the Fourth Plenary Session of both parties shall be handled by the Fourth Central Executive Committee at its first meeting in Nanjing."</p>
<h3>The Finance and Economic Committees Will Hold Regular Meetings in Beijing</h3>
<p>Song Ziwen Made a Speech Yesterday</p>
<p>The Guomin News Agency said that regarding the establishment of a Finance Committee by the National Government, Finance Minister Song made a speech, saying that the establishment of a Finance Committee that can represent all sectors of the country is a new era in our country's financial community. Since then, the budget can be established, and the income and expenditure of the national treasury can be made public. For four years, this ministry has repeatedly proposed the necessity of establishing a budget for the government, but due to various problems, it has not been realized until recently, when the country is in great difficulty, and the government and the people know that this move can no longer be delayed. In the two provinces of Hubei and Jiangxi, the red disaster is overwhelming, in the north there is the rebellion of Shi Yousan, in the south there is the change in Guangdong Province, the Yangtze River basin is suffering from floods, the world economy is in chaos and depression, and our country's business situation is also in a desperate situation. Recently, the violent Japanese invasion has occupied our eastern provinces. In the past half year, the disasters and pains suffered by our country are unprecedented in other countries. Even one of them is enough to subvert a general government. However, the National Government has gone through thousands of difficulties and dangers, and has not yet been shaken. Its perseverance is really commendable. Moreover, the series of events in the past few months has made the people of the whole country know that at this time of national crisis, various problems must be dealt with in a practical manner, and they can no longer be perfunctory. The Finance Committee is also the Ningxin'er in this period of national crisis. The purpose of establishing this conference is also in line with the opinions exchanged between representatives of Beijing and Shanghai and the banking community. Among the organizational outline, the following points are most noteworthy: (1) In addition to important military and political personnel from the government, there are also representatives from the industrial, commercial and academic circles in the organization of the committee, and the national finance can be studied openly by all parties in the country. (2) Several vacancies in the committee are reserved for recommendation by Guangdong. (3) All military and political expenses must be reviewed by the committee. (4) All income and expenditure of the government shall be announced every two weeks. (5) The issuance of public bonds must also be audited by the committee. The central government does not want to meet Guangdong with weapons, and the Guangdong side does not want to meet the central government with weapons. The people of the country have also unanimously hated all internal wars. It is the consensus of the people of the country that they have been tired of chaos for a long time. In the future, this will surely be achieved. There is no need to use divination. It is also expected that military expenditure can be gradually reduced. The committee is now scheduled to hold its first meeting in Nanjing this Sunday to discuss the major plans for national finance. It is also noteworthy that when the Finance Committee holds its meeting, the National Economic Committee will also hold its first meeting in Nanjing on the same day. The organization of the Economic Committee is the same as that of the Finance Committee. In addition to government personnel, there are leaders from industrial, commercial, financial, and educational circles. The purpose of the conference is to express itself to the world in a regular and systematic way, and to develop China with the help of the League of Nations. The League of Nations has sent an educational investigation team to China, and its team investigating our country's water conservancy and road construction projects has also embarked on its journey. I deeply hope that after the establishment of the Finance Committee and the Economic Committee, on the one hand, the government's economic needs can be met with systematic economic methods, and on the other hand, the domestic industrial, commercial, and transportation industries can be developed at the same time. I sincerely wish the two conferences a bright future."</p>
<h3>Military Police Group Sets Up Intelligence Department</h3>
<p>In Order to Obtain Timely Information, Especially Pay Attention to Zhabei</p>
<p>The joint office of the military, police, and regiment in this city was established the day before yesterday, but the situation in Shanghai is quite tense. Therefore, the military and police authorities, in addition to setting up an office, are also working hard on the defense of various districts. According to news from the Public Security Bureau yesterday, after the establishment of the military, police, and regiment office, the various agencies are too far apart and cannot communicate with each other. Therefore, an intelligence department was specially organized yesterday. From now on, as soon as an incident occurs in the local area, the military and police authorities can get the news in an instant and add more stringent prevention. Because Zhabei is located in a strategic location, more attention is being paid to Zhabei, and forces are concentrated there. As for other places such as the South City, the defense is also very strict. The Public Security Bureau is confident that it has the ability to maintain public order and suppress local disturbances.</p>

<h3>Shishi News Advocates Building a Memorial Tower for General Han</h3>
<p>Social Response Spurred a Temporary Surge in Donations Sent to the Newspaper's Accounting Department</p>
<p>Shishi News believes that in the Sino-Russian war, General Han Guangdi sacrificed himself and gave his life for the country. His righteousness is awe-inspiring, and his spirit is immortal. How can he be allowed to be buried in obscurity and rest with the grass and trees? At this time of national crisis, when scholars lack complete integrity, it is precisely possible to model later generations, warn those who are responsible for defending the territory at present, and move those who admire their predecessors in the future. In view of this, the newspaper specially advocated building a tower for General Han to pass on immortality. Since its publication, the society has followed suit for a time, and letters have been received from all parties, at least a thousand a day. Regarding donations, they are actively donating. Yesterday, the accounting department of the museum was too busy (it has received more than a thousand yuan in one day). Starting today, a separate collection office will be set up to handle the matter. As for the letters, some urge the progress, some are engineering experts who are willing to draw and build for free, and even some singers and so on donate the money obtained from their hard work and beauty.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>The money is generously donated, which shows that the people of the country have the same deep enthusiasm for the martyrs who died and the heroes who defended the country. From now on, if anyone wishes to donate and help, please send it directly to the accounting department of the newspaper for verification.</p>
<h3>Opening of the Shanghai County Agricultural Product Exhibition</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Farmers' Education Hall, in order to promote agricultural products and improve farmers' income, held the opening ceremony of the Agricultural Product Exhibition at 1:00 p.m. on the 12th of this month. Attendees included Yang Peiwen, representative of the Ministry of Education, Shou Biao, representative of the Ministry of Industry, Shi She, representative of the Provincial Government, Wang Huazhao, representative of the Department of Finance, Lu Feizhi, representative of the Department of Agriculture and Mines, Lu Youchang of the Jianghai Customs Supervisory Office, Yan Shenyu, County Governor, Peng Liren, Lv Zhe, and Jiang Yanchou of the County Party Department, Zhang Yisan, representative of the Construction Bureau, and more than 1,000 farmers. The meeting was chaired by Yan Shenyu, President, Cai Youchang recorded, and the prayer was performed as usual. The President's report briefly stated that today's opening of the first Shanghai County Agricultural Product Exhibition has been through a long period of preparation and many aspects of help, and it was established today. Although it is raining, the attendance is still enthusiastic. The purpose of our opening this meeting is because Shanghai County is close to the urban area, and farmers are running to the urban area. Everyone is unwilling to farm, which leads to a daily decline in agricultural income and increasing difficulties in farmers' livelihoods. We want to use the results of this competition exhibition to make everyone interested in agriculture and gradually improve agricultural work. We want everyone to know the importance of agriculture and pay attention to increasing the production of agricultural products. Moreover, because the Agricultural Education Hall has been running for several years, we want to take an opportunity to show the results and see what the results of the work are. The direction of future progress can be seen at today's venue. There are many products, and there are also many excellent ones. Therefore, I hope that everyone will know that we not only pay attention to the products, but also pay attention to their output. We want everyone to work harder and focus on cultivation, so that the exhibition can progress and develop year by year. This is what we most hope for.</p>
<p>(1) Provincial Representative Shi She's Speech: "The province wants me to represent them in participating in this meeting, which is very gratifying. I have one feeling about the results of this meeting, thinking that the most important thing in our life is food, and China is an agricultural country. The food is not enough every year, and we have to import it from abroad, which makes China poorer year by year and sends a lot of money to foreign countries. To save this loss, we must promote agricultural production and scientific research. Foreign countries pay attention to research, so their output is very high and they can sell it to China. China is such a big country, and we can't even eat enough by ourselves. Isn't it very dangerous? Today's meeting is to ask everyone to find ways to increase agricultural products, improve agriculture, and increase farmers' income. When farmers are rich, the country can also be rich. When the country is rich, China will naturally be strong, and naturally we will not be afraid of Japanese aggression. Therefore, today's agricultural exhibition has a very important definition."</p>
<p>(1) County Party Department Representative Peng Liren's Speech: "There is a problem of poverty in the society now, and everyone feels that there is no food to eat. We want everyone to overcome this difficulty, so we must pay attention to production and promote agriculture. Recently, the situation in Shanghai is mostly difficult to live in, and the countryside is also declining. Farmers are running to Shanghai, and their own farmland is not planted. As a result, they don't see food to eat in Shanghai, and they are still poor. Therefore, the most fundamental and best way to solve the problem of poverty is to promote agricultural production, because agriculture accounts for the main part of the social economy. When production increases, everything can be done. Now the Agricultural Education Hall is opening this exhibition, hoping that everyone will pay attention to increasing agricultural production, which can indirectly solve everyone's problem of eating. I hope everyone will pay more attention and participate more, so that the next conference will be very colorful."</p>
<p>(1) Finance Department Representative Wang Huazhao's Speech: "China is an agricultural country. To seek national wealth and strength, we should pay attention to the improvement of agriculture. China's flood this year required borrowing a large amount of American wheat for relief. If we had accumulated surplus food in normal times, we could have avoided this loss. The meaning of today's meeting is to hope that everyone will do more research in the future, break the old habits, and everyone will have an enterprising spirit. Those who win awards in the agricultural product exhibition competition should be especially happy and strive for further progress. Those who did not win awards should also look at other people's examples and learn other people's methods, so that the next conference can also stand out. That is my greatest hope."</p>
<p>Recreation after the opening ceremony of the conference: (1) National martial arts, (2) Meow Meow Cat, (3) News reporter, (4) The End of the Unscrupulous Merchant, (5) The Descent of the National Demon, (6) Bandit Suppression, (7) Hot Blood, (8) Ventriloquism, (9) Shaoxing Master. After the conference, in order to arouse the interest of farmers, people from all walks of life were specially invited to participate in the performances. In the evening, the Shadow Wish and Zhuanqiao Road were crowded with traffic, and everyone dispersed happily.</p>
<h3>Shanghai City Grain Tax Reduced by 0.7%</h3>
<p>The Land Bureau Ordered Books to be Made Quickly for the Winter Canal Census</p>
<p>Shanghai City is busy with the canal tax and grain. The Municipal Government, in view of the fact that farmland has suffered losses due to the disaster this year, has been ordered by Mayor Zhang to sympathize with the people and reduce it by 0.7% like the County Government, actually collecting 0.93%. The Land Bureau has now been ordered to comply. Since the winter canal season will soon be levied, the bookman Chen Bingrong was dispatched to notify the bookmen of the various Bao Tu in the city to quickly make the winter canal grain books, calculating that the tax and additional levies for the 16th, 18th, and 21st Bao are a total of six yuan and three corners per stone, and the tax and additional levies for the 24th and 26th Bao are six yuan, two corners, four points, and eight li per stone.</p>
<h3>Six Methods of the Anti-Poison and Anti-Japanese Group</h3>
<p>The China National Anti-Poison Society's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Corps has translated the evidence of Japanese people poisoning China into English, and sent it along with the English version of the Tanaka Memorial to important organizations around the world. The anti-Japanese new wall charts published by the group have also been printed and dispatched to personnel for posting in important streets of this city. Those enthusiastic people who wish to join the reprint can have the group handle it for 15 yuan per thousand copies. It is learned that the group resolved yesterday to submit six suggestions to the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, which are recorded as follows: (1) It is requested to promote various groups to send telegrams urging students studying in France and Belgium, as well as overseas Chinese party departments, to petition the League of Nations for a declaration. If this meeting cannot firmly order the Japanese army to withdraw its troops, then our people will automatically declare war on Japan, regardless of any sacrifice. (2) Try to request the Central Propaganda Department, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Shanghai press and business circles to jointly establish a large-scale international telegraph agency to publicize the atrocities of the Japanese people as much as possible, so that the world can understand the truth. (3) Japanese advisors and staff in various agencies and Japanese instructors in various armies have been dismissed one after another. However, Japanese staff in the national customs, post office, and salt inspection offices have not been dismissed. All sectors should unite and request the government to dismiss them as soon as possible to avoid them being mixed in important agencies and secretly acting as spies. (4) Hereafter, merchants' sales contracts, bidding contracts, various printing and construction undertakings shall all indicate that Japanese goods are not used. If Japanese goods are used, the price will not be paid, etc. Store invoices and wrapping paper shall also indicate responsible statements confirming that they are not Japanese goods, etc., to show determination. (5) Please ask teachers and students of national art schools and national artists to hold large-scale anti-Japanese art propaganda, so that the general public can deeply plant anti-Japanese impressions, which is especially beneficial to the propaganda of illiterate compatriots. (6) According to reports from various groups in Xiamen, the Xiamen authorities are suppressing the patriotic movement, not allowing propaganda, not allowing boycotts, and absolutely prohibiting anti-Japanese meetings. The Xiamen teachers and staff held a meeting a few days ago, which was only possible after several negotiations. Only 200 weak scholars attended the meeting, while no less than 400 armed military police were present to suppress it. The means of suppressing and flattering foreigners can be described as extremely extreme. According to local propaganda, the Xiamen authorities and the Japanese consul have secretly signed acts of treason and humiliation of the country. People's comments are not without reason. Please send a letter to the Xiamen authorities to warn them, and request the central government to order a thorough investigation.</p>
<h3>Measures to Relief Chinese Workers in Japanese Factories</h3>
<p>Has been decided by the Anti-Japanese Association after consultation</p>
<p>First Step: Register the Number of Chinese Workers</p>
<p>There are a total of 45 Japanese-owned textile factories in China, with 1,630,430 spindles, 190,844 thread spindles, and 14,082 looms, employing 77,792 Chinese workers. It is estimated that 3,191,769 dan of cotton are used, 823,437 bales of yarn are produced, and 7,587,767 bolts of cloth are produced. Shanghai has the largest number, with 30 factories, 1,148,184 spindles, 189,824 thread spindles, and 9,846 looms. Qingdao is the second largest, followed by Liaoning, Hankou, and Dalian. Since the people of our country automatically cut off economic relations with Japan due to the violent Japanese occupation of our Liaoning and Jilin, Japanese-owned yarn factories in China have become exhausted. The Japanese Textile Industry Association in China has held several meetings to discuss countermeasures. An emergency meeting will be held in Osaka on the 10th to determine fundamental policies, and Chairman Takei Ayazō will be sent to Shanghai to discuss concrete methods. In order to relieve the discharged Chinese workers of Japanese yarn factories, the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association has organized a committee, appointing Lu Jingshi, Fang Jiaobo, Wang Xiaolai, Hou Dachun, Zhang Zilian, and other five people as members. At the same time, it is guiding workers in Japanese yarn factories to organize anti-Japanese associations. The anti-Japanese associations in the eastern and western factories of Shanghai have been formally established. The first step is to start registering the names and numbers of Chinese workers in Japanese yarn factories for record keeping, and the Anti-Japanese Association will consult with leaders of Chinese yarn factories to discuss placement methods. The Central Training Department has also sent personnel to Shanghai to consult with the municipal government and the municipal party department on relief measures. It is reported that concrete relief measures have been determined. When Japanese yarn factories close down, placement can be carried out according to the agreed-upon methods. As for the more than 1,000 workers who voluntarily resigned from the Gongda Yarn Factory, it has been arranged by Lu Jingshi, a member of the Anti-Japanese Association, to be placed in Chinese yarn factories.</p>
<h3>Anti-Japanese Association Finds That Zheng Zenan's Bribery Case Was Falsely Accused</h3>
<p>Zhu Anqing Should Be Dealt With According to Law for Harbouring Resentment</p>
<p>Ju Jiqiu, a staff member of the secretariat of the Anti-Japanese Association, reported that Zheng Zenan, chairman of the Sugar Industry Association, was bribing to release goods. The 16th Standing Committee meeting previously resolved that the Investigation Department should cooperate with the Economic Isolation Implementation Committee of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to conduct a detailed investigation for verification. Now, according to the Investigation Department's report after clarifying the original case, the 18th Standing Committee meeting resolved: (1) Zheng Zenan was framed by someone harbouring resentment and should be exonerated in the newspaper; (2) Yuan Yu Sugar's bribery to foreigners should be confiscated and not discussed; (3) The Reconnaissance Department should order Zhu Anqing to be handed over to the association for legal action after bail; (4) The anti-bribery staff member Ju Jiqiu should be awarded 200 yuan. The report of the Investigation Department is appended as follows: For the matter of reporting, the entire volume of Zheng Zenan's bribery case was submitted and dispatched, and Comrade Yu Zulun was sent to investigate in detail. Now, according to the reply, after being dispatched, together with Comrade Ye Jiaxing, a member of the Economic Isolation Implementation Committee against Japan, investigated the Zheng Zenan case. After a detailed investigation of all parties involved, the results obtained are summarized responsibly as follows: (1) After the Yuan Yu and Mao He numbers were found by the Sugar Industry Association to be suspected of selling Japanese sugar, the meeting decided on October 4 not to discuss it. Then, after the meeting, Zheng Zenan ordered the two firms to donate 1,500 yuan each as funding for the sugar industry primary school. (2) Zhu Anqing and Zheng Zenan have an old feud, so he instigated Yuan Yu to change the registration to "National Salvation Gold" on the account, and then reported it to the association. (3) When the donation was made, Yu Yizhai, the manager of Yuan Yu, was not in Shanghai. After returning to Shanghai, he talked about it with Zhu Anqing and was fooled by Zhu. After being questioned by colleagues, he urgently wanted to settle the matter and took back the account book. However, Zhu Anqing blackmailed a huge amount of money and lobbied the association staff, and even settled the matter privately. After investigation, Zhu Anqing's first secret report was issued out of personal hatred, and then he wanted to settle the matter, intending to profit from it. This person should be brought to justice to warn against treachery. (4) Zhu Anqing and Zhu Anfu are relatives. The promise of promotion and wealth was initiated by Anfu, and the bribe of 1,000 yuan was handled by Anfu. Now he is avoiding meeting, which is very hateful. (5) Yu Yizhai's inconsistency shows that he is guilty, but judging from the inside story, Yu is indeed a loyal and useless person. This time, he was completely fooled by Zhu Anqing, resulting in a dilemma, and the 1,000 yuan was also taken out by Yu privately. According to this, the investigator believes that the claim is true. Therefore, this report is submitted, hoping for your approval. Respectfully submitted to the Standing Committee.</p>
<h3>The Social Bureau Orders the Organization of a National Goods Evaluation Committee</h3>
<p>Prohibit Unscrupulous Merchants from Raising Prices</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Bureau instructed the Municipal Chamber of Commerce: For the matter of compliance, according to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's Instruction Shangzi No. 8562, the Ministry found in February this year that the Fujian National Goods Promotion Association requested the prohibition of raising prices of national goods. The bureau was ordered to issue a sincere announcement. Later, in June, the Executive Yuan issued a letter from the Central Secretariat, and the Hubei Provincial Party Department requested a strict prohibition of unscrupulous merchants from raising prices after the reduction of tariffs. It was re-notified to comply with the record. It is now reported that at this time of vigorously promoting the national goods movement, there are still merchants selling national goods who disregard the overall situation, covet petty profits, and take the opportunity to raise prices for sale, which is extremely hateful. It is important to know that the higher the price of national goods is raised, the smoother the sales of foreign goods will be. It not only infringes on the interests of customers, but also undermines the progress of the group. It is appropriate to reiterate the previous order, that the bureau should transfer to its affiliated chambers of commerce, summon industrialists and merchants to organize a national goods evaluation committee, investigate in detail the national goods sold on the market, and immediately flatten those who raise prices. At the same time, it should announce to the public that if there are unscrupulous merchants raising prices, they are allowed to report them by name and add appropriate punishment to warn and encourage them. This order, for the chamber of commerce to deliberate and reply to.</p>

<p>The National Government's Flood Relief Committee, in View of the Arrival of Winter and the Urgent Need for Winter Relief, and the Need to Consider Spring Relief Measures at This Time, Has Specially Stipulated Ten Detailed Rules for Winter and Spring Emergency Relief Funds and Food Work Relief Measures. At the Same Time, the Disaster Area Working Group of the Association Also Stipulated Four Winter Relief Guidelines and Three Work Relief Methods for Commissioners in Various Areas, Which Are of Great Importance to the Future of Relieving Victims. Now They Are Recorded as Follows:</p>
<p>The Detailed Rules for Food Work Relief. The Detailed Rules for Winter and Spring Emergency Relief Funds and Food Work Relief Stipulated by the Association Total Ten Articles. Article 1: Within the Number of Relief Funds and Food Allocated to the Disaster-Stricken Counties, They May Be Appropriately Proposed to Subsidize the People to Repair Public Embankments and Implement Work Relief. Article 2: Based on the Amount of Relief Funds and Food That Can Be Used for Work Relief, Verify the Total Number of Projects in the County That Destroyed Public Embankments, and Allocate Them on Average. If There Is No Embankment Disaster County, It Can Be Used to Dig Public Ditches and Build Public Roads, With the Main Purpose of Working in Their Local Area. Article 3: According to the Provisions of Article 2, the Owners of the Embankment and Other Impartial Local People Must Draw Up a Drawing Budget of the Earthwork of the Project and Report It to the Relief Personnel for Review. After Verifying the Earthwork Project of the Whole County, Determine the Subsidiary Composition, and Then Verify That the Landlords in the Embankment Can Complete the Project With the Support of Relief Funds. Otherwise, They Shall Not Be Granted Relief. Article 4: Although the People's Public Embankment Is Assigned to Subsidize Relief Funds and Food, It Must Be Divided into Four Times for Distribution. Distribute It Once When the Work Is 1/4, Distribute It Once When It Is Half, Distribute It Once When It Is 3/4, and Distribute It Once After the Completion and Acceptance. Article 5: If It Is Digging Public Ditches and Building Public Roads, Those Who Can Be Donated by Philanthropists Can Be Incorporated Into the Handling and Work as Much as Possible. Article 6: Whether It Is Repairing People's Public Embankments or Digging Ditches and Building Roads, There Must Be More Than Three Substantial and Credible Local People to Guarantee That They Will Be Responsible for Compensation If the Project Is Not Completed or the Work Is Not Good.

If There Is Any Discrepancy, They Should Correct It to the Person in Charge. Article 9: Each Time Relief Personnel Distribute Subsidiary Relief Funds or Ditch Road Funds, They Must Supervise How They Are Allocated. Each Time They Issue It, They Must Obtain a Receipt From the Responsible Person and Report It. Article 10: These Detailed Rules Shall Be Reported to the Standing Committee by the Disaster Area Work Organization for Record and Then Promulgated for Implementation.</p>
<p>Winter Relief Implementation Guidelines. At the Same Time, the Disaster Area Working Group of the Association Formulated Four Winter Relief Implementation Guidelines for Commissioners in Various Areas Starting in November: (1) According to the Time Situation, It Should Be the Winter Relief Period. In Addition to the Victims Who Have Not Completely Receded From the Accumulated Water and Cannot Return Home, the Shelters That Have Been Established Should Still Be Relieved. All Areas Where the Water Has Receded Should Be Allowed to Return Home and Prepare to Resume Operations. (2) If There Is a Small Amount of Work Relief That Can Be Handled Locally, Appropriate Amounts Should Be Proposed From the Allocated Emergency Relief Funds and Food and Held Immediately. (Note That the Workplace Under the Jurisdiction of This Group Is Temporarily Focused on Restoring the Main River System's Important Official Embankments. Branches and Embankments, As Well As Roads and Ditches, Etc., Are Difficult to Take Care of for a While. If There Are Such Small Projects That Can Be Carried Out, They Can Be Carried Out Locally Under the Emergency Relief Item. The Emergency Relief Method Is Not Limited to the Two Ends of the Shelter or Providing Food According to the Population. When Possible, Work Relief Is Allowed.) (3) In Areas Where the Water Has Receded, Victims Return Home. Appropriate Travel Expenses or Equivalent Rations Should Be Given According to the Distance of Their Return. Before or Simultaneously, Personnel Should Be Sent to the Countryside to Check Households and Give Tickets in Accordance With the Reporting Rules and Distribute Relief Food. (4) If the Water Has Not Completely Receded From the Entire Territory, the Shelter Should Reduce the Population Returning Home From the Receded Land. If the Water Has Completely Receded, the Shelter Should Be Closed. If There Are Any Helpless Elderly or Weak, They Should Also Be Ordered to Return to Their Hometown to Receive Relief.</p>
<p>Work Relief Work Scope. The Disaster Area Working Group Also Stipulated Three Work Relief Work Scopes: (1) After This Flood, the Official and Civilian Embankments Collapsed and Were Scoured Everywhere. If You Want to Repair Them One by One, It Will Be Difficult to Pad Manpower and Financial Resources. The Work Relief of This Association Should Be Cultivated Separately by Officials and Private Individuals, and the Urgency of Work Should Be Determined and Key Points Should Be Held to Meet the Emergency. (2) Based on This Idea, This Group Should Weigh the Allocation of Grain, Rice, and Funds in Consultation With the Provincial Government and Competent Authorities Where the Project Is Located, Gather Victims, Divide Into Sections for Construction, and Distribute Relief According to the Amount of Work. Local Areas Should Raise Funds to Supplement Relief If It Is Insufficient. (3) It Is Intended That the Work Is Huge and the Funds Are Insufficient, Which Is Inevitable. It Is Intended to Submit a Further Request to the National Government to Raise Relief Funds. If It Is Approved, It Can Reduce the Burden on Local Areas</p>
<p>Delineation of Work Authority. Regarding the Delineation of Work Responsibilities for Work Relief Work, the Disaster Area Working Group Also Stipulated Three Methods: (1) The Various Works Within the Scope of Emergency Relief Are Handled by the Commissioners in Various Areas (Emergency Relief Is Not Limited to Shelters or Food Relief and Money Relief, Etc. When Local Small Projects Can Be Carried Out by Hiring Victims, Those That Can Be Handled by Allocating Funds From Emergency Relief Are Handled by the Commissioners.) (2) Regarding Work Relief and Agricultural Relief Matters, the Commissioners Are Requested to Fully Provide Opinions and Materials in Consultation With Local Officials and Gentry to Develop Implementation Methods by the Work Relief and Agricultural Relief Departments. (3) The Implementation Organization of Work Relief and Agricultural Relief Shall Be Conducted in a Coordinated Manner by the Work Relief Office and the Agricultural Relief Office in Accordance With Local Conditions.</p>
<h3>Postal Workers' Union Attention to the You Case</h3>
<p>A Document Submitted to the Municipal Party Department and a Letter to the Bar Association</p>
<p>You Bolu, the main culprit in the Baoshan Road tragedy, was tried once by the District Court on the 10th of this month. The official announced that the plaintiff had not arrived, and the trial was rescheduled. It is reported that the Municipal Party Department and the Municipal Government decided to provide considerable compensation to the family of the deceased. However, after the compensation, all private lawsuits and independent rights of appeal related to the case would be waived by the family. Upon hearing this, the union was deeply suspicious and submitted a request to the Municipal Party Department for clear instructions to resolve their doubts. The union also, because lawyers Zhang Yaozeng and others were willing to defend You, who had slaughtered the people, sent a letter to the Bar Association requesting it to immediately warn Zhang Yaozeng and others to voluntarily terminate their contract to represent You in court and to severely punish the lawyers. The document submitted to the Municipal Party Department and the letter to the Bar Association are recorded below:</p>
<p>To the Municipal Party Department: A Request for Examination and Instructions. You Bolu, while serving as the head of the 5th District of the Public Security Bureau, arbitrarily issued orders and wantonly opened fire, slaughtering patriotic people. His crimes were heinous and aroused public outrage. The families of the dead and wounded had filed public and private lawsuits in court. When the court opened the trial on the 10th of this month, it was heard that the plaintiffs were summoned to your department, so they were unable to attend the court. It was also heard that your department, in conjunction with the municipal government, decided to give considerable compensation to the family of the deceased, but after the compensation, all private lawsuits and independent rights of appeal concerning the case were to be waived by the family. Upon hearing this, we were deeply astonished. The families were innocently victimized, a great tragedy. Even if You were sentenced to the most severe punishment and all of his private property was used for compensation and pensions for the victims, it would still not be enough to redress their grievances. Your department, together with the municipal government, generously provided compensation. It was a sign of compassion and a duty that should be fulfilled. However, the private lawsuits filed in court and the independent rights of appeal, according to the law, how can they be waived? They should continue to be pursued in court to protect legal rights. Our association speaks frankly and cannot remain silent. Therefore, we specifically submit this document to your department for clear instructions to resolve our doubts. We are anxiously awaiting your response.</p>
<p>To the Bar Association: Regarding the report that when the You Bolu case was heard in the District Court on the 10th of this month, lawyers Zhang Yaozeng, Sha Xunyi, and Zhu Shaowen were in court to defend You, we cannot but express our indignation. You Bolu undermined the patriotic movement and slaughtered patriotic people. His atrocities are unforgivable. All who have conscience should hate him. Your association has always upheld justice, demonstrated the law, and set an example for society. Since the outbreak of the Japanese invasion, your association has even issued a general order prohibiting your members from representing those who undermine the patriotic movement and are convicted as traitors. Your patriotic zeal is deeply appreciated. Zhang Yaozeng and others, as lawyers in this city, should arouse their conscience and strictly comply with the resolution of your association. However, they openly and brazenly represented the traitor You in court, not only violating the resolution of your association but also abetting the evildoer and indirectly undermining the patriotic movement. They have completely lost their conscience. How can they have a conscience? At this critical moment of resisting Japan and saving the nation, we cannot tolerate such scum surviving in the world. Therefore, we send this letter to your association, urging you to uphold the spirit of your previous resolution and immediately warn Zhang Yaozeng and others to voluntarily terminate their contract to represent You in court and to severely punish Zhang Yaozeng and others to serve as a warning to others and to eliminate the scum. We also hope to receive a reply soon to affirm our public friendship.</p>
<h3>Procedures for Sheltering Disaster Victims in This City</h3>
<p>To Be Handed Over to Su Zhenhui and Others Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Disaster Relief Office in this city was originally scheduled to close at the end of this month, and the disaster victims who came to Shanghai were also planned to be sent back by the end of this month. However, the fellow-villagers associations and relief organizations from the disaster areas requested to continue sheltering them because the floods in various disaster areas have not completely receded. On the other hand, the Social Bureau stated that the severe winter is approaching and that they need to rush to handle other charitable undertakings, so they are unable to take care of both. Therefore, the disaster relief affairs are planned to be handled by the Jiangsu Flood Relief Association, the Gaoyou Flood Relief Association, and the Anhui Fellow-Villagers Association in Shanghai. According to Feng Liutang, the chief of general affairs of the office, told a reporter of Xin Sheng She yesterday, the disaster relief affairs will be taken over by the various relief organizations. The office will hold an office meeting today to discuss the handover procedures. The date of takeover has been set for tomorrow. At that time, the office will prepare to hand over all matters to the organizers. At the same time, the disaster victims from various places can continue to stay in Shanghai. Currently, there are 4,618 disaster victims in the shelter, and there are also about 2,000 new arrivals outside the shelter. Also, Mr. Wang Yiting went to the office yesterday to discuss everything with Director Feng. When the office meeting is held today, the organizers have assigned Qu Wenliu, Wang Binyan, and others to participate.</p>
<h3>Gun Burned</h3>
<p>The Truth of a Murder for Inheritance is Not Successfully Hidden by Crackling in the Kitchen</p>
<p>Zhang Guoxiang, Zhang Yuxiang, and Zhang Qingxiang, sons of Zhang Linsheng of Huayuan Shiqiao, Pudong, were dividing the inheritance when Yuxiang was shot dead and Guoxiang was seriously injured. After investigation by the Third District Police Station, it was found that Zhang Qingxiang was born to Zhang Linsheng's concubine, Zhang Zhang. Zhang Zhang's younger brother, Zhang Quansheng, shot and killed Yuxiang. They were both transferred to the District Court. It is now known that Shen Zhaoming, the prosecutor of the District Court, meticulously investigated the case and determined that Zhang Quansheng was the murderer. He wanted his sister and nephew to inherit the family property alone, so he killed the son of the legal wife. He had a gun for the murder, but it was big and useless, so he exchanged it for a small four-inch pistol from Yang Fulin. His premeditated murder is evident. However, because he was lying in court, he sent Judicial Police Chief Xu Jinqing, along with bailiffs Wang Jianqing and Zhou Qiwu, to search for the gun to use as evidence the day before yesterday. Unexpectedly, after the incident, Zhang Quansheng hid the gun in the stove and burned it, hoping to destroy the evidence temporarily. After being arrested, his wife did not know that there were still bullets in the gun and did not take them out, so she still cooked rice. Unexpectedly, after the fire caught the bullets, there was a sudden crackling in the stove, and the neighbors were terrified, suspecting that it was robbery and blocking the front and back doors to arrest the bandits. Zhang's wife, in a hurry, hid the gun again and buried it in the field afterward. Therefore, when Police Chief Xu and others went to search, they could not find it at the time. After using detective methods to find out the previous situation, they first found two exploded bullets in the stove. Then, they used various methods and words to force Zhang's wife to lead them to the field to find the gun, but it had already been burned. They brought the gun and bullets to the court and reported the situation to Prosecutor Shen. Since the facts of the case are evident, he ordered them to be stored in the warehouse together, awaiting strict handling according to the law.</p>
<h3>How Can the Dignity of the Court Allow Abuse and Protection?</h3>
<p>Dong Zhenlong's Careless Words Make Zhang Baofeng Feel Unhappy, and He Files a Lawsuit for Public Insult</p>
<p>Dong Zhenlong, the manager of the Shenzhou Hotel on Fourth Avenue, was involved in a lawsuit with others over a housing dispute on the afternoon of October 23 of this year in the First Court of the Special District. At that time, there was a Ningbo native named Zhang Baofeng</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>, who used to be a tenant of the Shenzhou Hotel's property. He was also one of the parties involved in the case, so he was summoned to court for the trial. When the judge was questioning him, Dong said that Zhang's testimony was contrary to his intentions and publicly abused him as "fang bi". After the adjournment, he scolded him as a "robber" in front of the seventh court. Therefore, Zhang Baofeng yesterday commissioned Lawyer Gu Jirong to accuse him of the crime of publicly insulting and defaming his reputation in accordance with Article 324 of the Criminal Law in the First Court of the Special District. Judge Feng heard the case in the second criminal court. First, the plaintiff stated as above and pointed out that there were two witnesses, Shan Xingwu and Chen Daosheng, who had heard the abuse. Judge Feng then summoned Shan Xingwu to testify. Shan said that he did not know Zhang and Dong personally. At that time, he was in the court to listen to another case. After Dong scolded Zhang, the audience in the court was in an uproar, thinking that the court was a place of dignity and it was strange to publicly scold people. After leaving the court, Zhang blamed Dong for not scolding him as "fang bi". Dong also scolded him as "You are simply a robber!" At that time, Zhang immediately asked me for my position and asked me to be a witness, so I came to court today to testify. Then, Dong Zhenlong was questioned. He said that in the court, in his reply to Judge Lu, because what Zhang said was inconsistent with the facts of the case, he used the meaning of analogy to say that his words were like "fang bi" and did not scold him personally. Then Zhang continued to say that the "fang bi" he said to Judge Lu did not refer to him, then it must refer to Judge Lu. If that is the case, then he is willing to have Judge Lu sue him, and it has nothing to do with him, because if he does not refer to him, then he must refer to the judge. At this point, the defendant also stated that the plaintiff deliberately slandered and insulted his reputation, and that when the case was not yet public, the Shibao had already published the plaintiff's complaint, which shows that he deliberately publicized it to damage his personal reputation. He presented the newspaper to the court. After Judge Feng read it, he asked Lawyer Gu, "This case has not been publicly tried. How could the reporter of the newspaper record the complaint?" Lawyer Gu replied, "Our reporters often come in and out, and I don't know how they recorded it. However, newspaper reporters have extremely flexible means of obtaining news, which has been recognized by the society, so I don't know how they got it. However, our lawyer personally has absolutely not given the complaint of this case to the reporter." At this point, the court ordered the debate to begin. After the lawyers of both sides debated, the court announced that the sentence would be pronounced on the afternoon of the 18th.</p>
<h3>Shareholders of Zhihe Money Shop Accused</h3>
<p>Should Be Liable for Jointly Repaying the Debt</p>
<p>Zhihe Yongji Money Shop went bankrupt on August 19, owing a huge debt of 2.5 million taels. The debt claims also amounted to 2.5 million taels, of which many were bad debts. For example, Shen Chengji's account owed 1.2 million taels, and the person himself has already fled, making it impossible to recover. Many shareholders are also avoiding appearing. The court-appointed liquidator, Accountant Tang Zaizhang, is legally carrying out liquidation. In addition to collecting debt claims to prepare for an average repayment of debts, he also found the shareholders' register and sent letters to the shareholders asking them to come forward to deal with the matter. Because many shareholders made excuses and shirked responsibility, he specifically filed a lawsuit with the court, asking the court to order the partners to be jointly and severally liable for repayment. The court opened the case in the First Special District District Court yesterday. Many creditors attended the court to listen. The presiding judge was Judge Li Mo, the plaintiff was Accountant Tang Zaizhang, and the lawyers representing the plaintiff were Wang Youling. The lawyers representing the defendant shareholders Chen Yizhai were Wu Jingxiong and Wang Fusang, and the lawyer representing shareholder Chen Rongchu was Zhang Zhengxue. The remaining shareholders did not appear in court. After reviewing the various accounts, the court scheduled another hearing for debate on the 24th of this month.</p>
<h3>Hu Fufang Killed by Kidnappers</h3>
<p>A Coroner's Examination</p>
<p>The Negotiations Were Not Very Smooth and the Corpse Was Collected by His Younger Brother for Burial</p>
<p>The Shanghai police officer No. 873 of the Jing'an Temple Police Station found a white package abandoned opposite the house No. 14 of Southwest Yang Road in Shanghai the night before last. There were blood stains on the outside. He opened the package and found a dismembered body inside. The hands, feet, and head had been cut off. He reported to the police station and ordered the detectives to transport the body to the Feilun Road Mortuary for examination. Details have been recorded in this newspaper. It is now known that the name of the dismembered body is Hu Fufang, 34 years old, a native of Shanghai, living at No. 811 Weihaiwei Road, operating a rice shop. His family is well-off. He also purchased land on Tongfu Road to build three houses, which are about to be completed. On the 17th of last month, Hu went to visit the new house and was kidnapped by several kidnappers at the intersection of Tongfu Road and Weihaiwei Road. They immediately sent a letter to his family, demanding a huge ransom. For more than half a month, the negotiations were not very smooth, and the kidnappers resented Hu and killed him. Then they dismembered the body and abandoned it on the side of the road. Yesterday morning, Guo Wei, the prosecutor of the First Special District Court, accompanied the forensic doctor Wei Ligong and the clerk Liu Chun to the mortuary for examination. The examination confirmed that Hu's body was at the public's disposal. First, the police station stated the facts of the discovery of the body and Hu's kidnapping. Then Hu Jinfang, the younger brother of the deceased, came to the case and requested to collect the body. Prosecutor Guo verified and ordered that Hu Fufang was indeed strangled to death by bandits and then dismembered. The body was returned to his younger brother Hu Jinfang for coffin burial, and the police station was ordered to strictly arrest the murderers and bring them to justice.</p>
<h3>Five Policemen Injured by a Car</h3>
<p>Lu Peiwang, a native of Yangzhou, living at No. 36 Hanzhong Lane, Hanzhong Road, Zhabei, was a driver for Sichuan Automobile Company on Avenue Joffre. On the evening of the 3rd of this month, he drove a car No. 12609 and drove to Avenue Lafayette at 12 o'clock, from west to east. There were nine Chinese police officers from the French Concession Police Station walking in front of him. The driver Lu accidentally knocked down five police officers, No. 256 Xu Zhengrong, No. 235 Cao Asi, No. 612 Chen Jinrong, No. 666 Lu Hongfu, and No. 697 Tao Benxiang. Their arms, legs, waists, backs, and other parts were injured. The accompanying police officers recorded the number and reported it to the police chief. The injured police officers went to the hospital for treatment. The injuries were minor, and they still went to work as usual. Yesterday, the Vehicle Management Office transferred Lu to the Second District Court Criminal Simple Court. The police station lawyer stated the case and filed a lawsuit in accordance with Article 301 of the Criminal Law. The injured police officers went to court to prove the situation of being hit. When questioned, Lu stated that the police officers were walking in the middle of the road, and the people were unable to brake in time, resulting in the accident. Judge Wu Fanglian verified the confession and ordered the police officers to go to the forensic doctor's office to examine the injuries. He also announced the end of the debate and ordered the defendant to pay 50 yuan and a guarantee. Without a guarantee, he would be detained.</p>
<h3>Tragic Abortion Death</h3>
<p>Wang Chen's Death is Pitiful, and Dagouzi is the Culprit</p>
<p>Wang Chen, a woman from Yancheng, Jiangbei, is 38 years old and currently lives at No. 1213 Lincoln Road, Shanghai West. Although old, she is unusually flirtatious. Because her husband, Wang, is in the countryside and she is not used to sleeping alone, she suddenly became acquainted with a fellow villager, nicknamed Dagouzi, this spring and lived together as if they were husband and wife. Unexpectedly, after a short time, she suddenly became pregnant and was already several months along. Her abdomen was bulging, and she was afraid that acquaintances would catch a glimpse and spread it to her husband's ears, which was a serious matter. So, four days ago, she entrusted a fellow villager, Xing Cui, to introduce her to Li Lin, who lives at No. 69 Guangfu Road, Caogadu, Shanghai West, to perform an abortion. She stated that the surgery fee was a certain amount of money. Li Lin took out a root of herb and inserted it into Wang Chen's lower body, saying that the fetus would fall out after two hours without worry. Unexpectedly, after three hours, not only did she not give birth, but Wang Chen became extremely painful and fainted, losing consciousness. Seeing that something had gone wrong, Li Lin still said that it was okay and massaged her abdomen with both hands, but it still didn't work. The situation was even more serious, and her limbs were icy cold and dying. She was rushed to Tongren Hospital for treatment, but it was too late to save her. She died in the afternoon of the day before yesterday.</p>
<h3>Chen Longhai's Wife Gives Birth to Triplets</h3>
<p>Chen Longhai, a native of Jiangyin who lives at No. 12 Minzhu Street, Lao Beimen, and works in copper and tin, is over forty years old and still has the worries of Bodao. He has been married to his wife, Zhang, for ten years and has not had any children. Unexpectedly, she suddenly became pregnant in May of this year. Chen was overjoyed and took great care of her, expecting her to give birth in February next year. Unexpectedly, recently Zhang's abdomen was as big as a bucket. Chen suspected it was a disease and sought medical attention, but it did not worsen. Unexpectedly, in the middle of the night the night before last, Zhang had severe abdominal pain, as if she was about to give birth. Chen quickly hired a midwife to wait for the birth. It was not until yesterday morning that she gave birth to a boy, but the parturient's abdomen was still cramping. Soon, she gave birth to another boy. Who knew that her abdomen was still painful, and she continued to give birth to another boy before stopping. She had a total of three boys in one birth, and they were all plump. The parturient and the children were safe. The neighbors came to see them when they heard the news. They all said that the children who were not yet full-term were so strong, which was indeed rare. Chen named them Xinde, Wangde, and Aide and filled out the forms to report to the First Branch of the Second District.</p>
<h3>Change in Business Hours of Postal Branches</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration, in view of the concentration of commercial firms in the Nanshi and French Concession Central District, will extend the receiving hours of the Gongguan Road, Nanshi Lima Road, and Bund branches to 9:00 PM starting from the 16th of this month for the convenience of senders posting express mail. Also, because the Caogadu branch and the Bairinan Road branch of Wujiaochang are very close, most senders tend to go to the Bairinan Road branch. Starting from the 16th of this month, the business hours of the Caogadu branch will be changed to be from 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Death of Yarn Merchant Xu Qingyun</h3>
<p>Yarn merchant Xu Qingyun had been suffering from stomach disease for a long time. Recently, he underwent surgery, but it was not effective. He died at 10:30 AM on the 11th of this month. Mr. Xu was a native of Cixi, Zhejiang, named Pinwei, also named Weixun, styled Qingyun, and was 51 years old. His ancestors in Shanghai had been in the yarn business. After his death, the business was unfavorable, and his assets were exhausted. Mr. Xu was only ten years old at the time. Seeing his mother depressed, he comforted her, saying, "There is still a son. Don't be too sad." So, he vowed to restore his ancestors' business. At the age of sixteen, he came to Shanghai to learn business, worked diligently and thriftily, and was determined to be successful. Within a few years, he had accumulated some surplus. He founded Futai Yarn Shop. At that time, a Western merchant abandoned a large batch of yarn goods in Shanghai due to poor business and returned to his country, which implicated a major bank. Mr. Xu invested heavily to purchase it from him. His peers secretly laughed at him, but he ignored them. Later, he relied on this to make a profit. From then on, Mr. Xu's courage was admired by his peers. When the stock exchange flourished, he and yarn merchants Mu Ouchu, Wu Linshu, Rong Zongjing, and others initiated the organization of the Chinese Yarn Exchange and served as directors and vice-chairmen of the exchange. In the tenth year of the Republic of China, the former Dafeng Yarn Factory closed down. At that time, after the European War, all the yarn factories in the country were greatly affected and suffered huge losses. Therefore, no one bought the former Dafeng Yarn Factory. It was about to be sold to foreign merchants, and the foreign merchants knew that the Chinese merchants did not dare to operate it, so they deliberately made things difficult, hoping to get it at a low price. Mr. Xu said with great emotion, "Can our country's yarn industry be ruined by this? I don't believe it. Moreover, if this factory falls into the hands of foreigners, then foreign merchants will inevitably have one more foundation to monopolize our country's yarn industry." At that time, his close friend Mr. Qin Runqing advised him to buy it, and Mr. Xu made up his mind. So, he bought it at a high price and collected shares to reorganize it, which is now the Shanghai Dafeng Qingji Yarn Factory. Mr. Xu served as chairman and general manager, planning everything in detail. Within a few years, great achievements were made. He also used his surplus funds to invest in banking and other industries with friends. After the May 30th Massacre, the Shanghai money market was extremely tight, and the financial community was worried. Mr. Xu believed that Shanghai was the commercial hub of the country. If there was a crisis in the financial community, it would inevitably affect the whole country. Therefore, he generously invested heavily to maintain it. Also, Mr. Xu lived frugally but was extremely filial to his mother, kind-hearted, and charitable. He made every effort to support social welfare and hometown charity. He served as a director of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and a member of the Labor-Capital Mediation Committee, being selfless and offering many suggestions. Mr. Xu was elected as the captain of the solicitation meeting and raised more than 50,000 yuan in a month. In addition, he served as a director of various charitable organizations, handled rice sales and construction of model prisons in Ningbo, donated to floods in various provinces, and so on, which are too numerous to mention. In the spring of this year, his stomach disease relapsed, and he went to Hangzhou for recuperation. Then he returned to Shanghai. After being treated by Chinese and Western medicine, none of them worked. He died the day before yesterday, which was a pity for those who knew him. It is said that the coffin will be encoffined at the end of the day on the 14th of this month.</p>
<h3>Japanese Merchants Create New Zhonghe Refining Factory</h3>
<p>Guomin She said that in addition to the factories set up by Chinese people, there is a Zhonghua Refining Company in Yokohama Bridge, which is set up by Japanese people. Its business is extremely developed. Since the boycott of Japanese goods to offset expenses, no one has asked about the Zhonghua Refining Company, so it had to close quietly. Unexpectedly, the Japanese are cunning and have moved traitors to come forward to set up the Zhonghe Refining Factory in the Lujiawan area. It has not been open for many days, but the business is surprisingly gathered. It is reported that the Anti-Japanese Association has heard about it and will give the Zhonghe Factory a heavy blow. Patriotic compatriots should pay attention to it.</p>
<h3>Shantytown Residents on Haig Road Appeal to Party and Government Agencies</h3>
<p>More than a dozen representatives of the shantytown residents on Haig Road in Shanghai West submitted a request to the Party and government authorities yesterday for assistance. Their submissions to the Municipal Party Department and the Municipal Social Bureau are as follows: Submitted for being ordered to be evicted by the French Concession Police Station, requesting assistance, and praying to be submitted to the Municipal Government to quickly build civilian houses to benefit the people's residences. The residents built shacks and lived along the eastern section of Haig Road in Shanghai West, near Laborier Road, for more than ten years. There are about 200 shacks, with more than a thousand men, women, old, and young. On the 6th of this month, the Police Station of Shan Zhong Road in the French Concession suddenly sent several detectives to come and claim that they were ordered to move out completely within two weeks and demolish the shacks, and not to live in the territory, otherwise they would send people to demolish them. The residents were shocked to hear this. The residents have always been rickshaw pullers, small cart pullers, coolie workers, and small businesses, living peacefully and never acting out of line. Moreover, due to the years of natural disasters and banditry in Jiangbei, they have no way to settle down. Especially this year's floods, they have been groaning to make a living. If they are evicted, the residents will inevitably be displaced, no different from being driven into hell. In addition, the weather is getting colder, and their suffering will be even more difficult to predict. Therefore, they specifically submit a request to your Association (Bureau) to show compassion for their poverty and allow them to submit it to the Municipal Government to quickly build civilian houses in the Shanghai West area so that the residents can move in to live. They also pray that the French Concession Police Station be restrained from interfering with the residents' living problems in Shanghai West before the civilian houses are built. For this reason, they should submit a document to your Association (Bureau), praying for examination and approval, so as to benefit the people's residences, and they will be grateful. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai Special Municipality Party Department (Municipal Social Bureau), Haig Road Shantytown Residents Representatives Qian Liudong, Pan Shaopeng, Chen Xiangshan, et al., November 13.</p>
<h3>Problem of the Foreign Merchant Plaintiff's Legal Person</h3>
<p>In the case of the US merchant Aier Wulai Kaoer Burke Company suing William Wu for a debt dispute in the First District Court of the Special District, the court had ordered the accountant to investigate and report on the issue of account reconciliation between the two parties before the case could be reviewed. Yesterday, when the hearing was held, the plaintiff's lawyer Lu Dun stated first, followed by the defendant's agents, lawyers Li Fengshen and Zhao, who stood up to object, stating that the subject of the lawsuit still needed to be corrected. Because in the original complaint, the plaintiff filed the lawsuit in the name of the company. According to the law, a foreign legal person who has not registered with the Chinese government cannot enjoy the right to sue. The court must order the original complaint to be corrected before the trial can proceed. Because the plaintiff company is located in New York, USA, it will take several months to supplement and sign the complaint. Therefore, Judge Lou ruled that the plaintiff should supplement the corrected complaint within two months and then reopen the trial.</p>

<h3>Reader's Letter</h3>
<p>Mr. Qian Dagong's message (abbreviated) (asks how a disabled person can serve the country)</p>
<p>(Answer) Although your body is not healthy, according to your letter, you are still able to stay at home to support your parents and teach your children and nephews. This is a great contribution to the family and the country, and it is where you are fulfilling your duty. In the future, when your children and nephews have completed their studies and put their knowledge to use, you will be able to look back on it with joy. Your current situation cannot be said to be a cowardly existence, and you yourself cannot be said to be useless. You must know that compared to some people who sit in high positions and enjoy many benefits, their behavior is not only useless to society, but may even be harmful. You can ask yourself if your conscience is much more at peace than theirs.</p>

<h3>Letters</h3>
<p>To the esteemed chief editor of the Shen Bao, On the 4th of this month, your newspaper published a telegram from party members in 16 counties of Jiangsu, which included my name. After investigation, I was never involved in this matter. It is obvious that someone has forged my name. In addition to having already jointly sent a telegram on the 9th with Wu Jin party member Li Shouzhi to correct this, I am now writing to you again, hoping that you will publish it in your newspaper to correct this error. I will be extremely grateful. Sincerely, Xu Qihua. November 13th.</p>
<p>Dear Sir, Yesterday I read in your newspaper the proposals of party members, including a telegram issued by Jia Ding party member Lü Guanqün on the matter of the peace conference, which included the names of Mao Xudong and Wang Shuxian, party members of Jiangning. After investigation, Xudong and Shuxian had no prior knowledge of this telegram, and we also do not know Comrade Lü Guanqün. In addition to sending a separate letter to Comrade Lü Guanqün, we are writing to your newspaper for verification and request that the original letter be published in full to clarify the truth. Sincerely, Mao Xudong and Wang Shuxian, party members of the Third District Branch of Jiangning County. November 9, 1931.</p>
<p>To the esteemed chief editor, I recently read in your newspaper on the 4th of this month a telegram from various party members in this province to Mr. Wang Jingwei and Cai Jimin, which contained many criticisms of Mr. Hu Zhantang. However, I, Chen Qilin, am driven by the need for food and clothing and currently work as an administrator at the Gaoqiao Primary School in Shanghai. Regarding this public telegram, it is not only against my personal wishes, but I also did not hear or ask about it before or after the event. There must be someone who has impersonated me. In addition to writing directly to the Jia Ding County Party Department to declare this, I am writing to request a correction. Sincerely, Chen Qilin, Jia Ding County party member. November 9th.</p>

<h3>Random Memories</h3>
<p>— Yanzi</p>
<p>Song Qing's Sole Defense of Jinzhou</p>
<p>Since the Donglin Party Incident in Korea, Xiangcheng (Yuan Shikai), then a special envoy to Korea, rushed back. The Sino-Japanese war was thus unavoidable. Wu Dacheng, the governor of Hunan, volunteered to lead troops, stationed outside the customs. The imperial court appointed Song Qing, the Sichuan brigade general, as his deputy. Song was experienced in military affairs, having been under Feng Zicai, whose troops defeated the French army at Liangshan during the Sino-French War. His soldiers were well-trained and had been through many battles. At daybreak, the entire army would form ranks and enter the training ground to practice shooting. When the Wu army heard the gunfire, they suspected that the enemy army was breaking through their defenses, and the entire army collapsed. Song's camp was originally meant to provide flanking support, but it was almost affected. Song led his troops to retreat and garrison Jinzhou, strictly repairing defenses. The Japanese army dispatched large forces to besiege the city for months, using all sorts of methods, but to no avail. Song's troops were skilled at shooting, and their shots were always accurate. They ambushed and defended the city walls, killing over a thousand Japanese soldiers attacking the city. The Japanese army feared them like tigers. When the Treaty of Shimonoseki was concluded, the imperial court ordered Song to return to his post as Sichuan brigade general and lead his troops back to Sichuan. The gentry and people of Jinzhou tried to stop his carriage without success, and bid him farewell in the western suburbs. Halfway through the drinking, Song stood up and delivered a deeply felt speech of thanks. Everyone present was moved to tears. His war exploits are scattered among many people's writings. The people of Jinzhou still praise him to this day. He was truly a famous general in the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95.</p>

<h3>Franklin (Part 1)</h3>
<p>One of the Biographies of Little Apprentices</p>
<p>Benjamin Franklin was born in 1706 and died in 1790, living to the age of eighty-four. After his death, his tombstone was inscribed with these lines: "He snatched power from the hands of emperors and electricity from the heavens."</p>
<p>This short epitaph is nothing less than a small reflection of Franklin's life, achievements, and scholarship. He was a politician, writer, and scientist. If you read his autobiography, you will be surprised to discover that this great man came from a humble background as a small apprentice. Everyone knows about his contributions to the American independence movement, so I don't need to say more. I just want to recount his small history as an apprentice and his contributions to science.</p>
<p>He entered a Latin elementary school at the age of eight, switched to an arithmetic and writing school at the age of nine, and dropped out of school at the age of ten due to financial difficulties. He followed his father to learn how to make candles and soap. He did not like this craft, but he was good at swimming and rowing and often wanted to go to sea. His father knew his inclinations and was very worried, so he often took him to visit carpenters, bricklayers, coppersmiths, winch makers, and other craftsmen on the street in order to choose a profession for life. This is a responsibility that all parents or teachers should fulfill. However, cursory visits are not very useful. We must guide children to look carefully, and only if they can do it after seeing it will it be effective. Franklin said in his autobiography that this kind of close and detailed visit had a great influence on him. Later, when things in the house were broken, he didn't need a craftsman, he could repair them himself, and if scientific experiments needed instruments, he could also make them himself. These skills all came from visiting craftsmen.</p>
<p>Although he was an apprentice in a candle shop, he liked to read. Two years later, his father asked him to learn printing because of this. In 1717, his brother James brought a printing press and type from England to set up a printing shop in Boston, and he was ordered by his father to sign a contract with James to be an apprentice for nine years. At this time, he was only twelve years old, and he would be twenty-one years old when the contract expired. Since he became an apprentice in the printing shop, he met many apprentices in bookstores, and the bookstores in the whole city became his circulating library. Whenever he borrowed a book, he had to finish reading it overnight, because according to the rules, he had to return it to the owner the next morning. In this way, although he was an apprentice, he was also a student, because he read several times more books than the students in ordinary schools.</p>
<h3>Caricatures in Japanese Newspapers</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Japan, with its small three islands, is insufficient to allow its people to thrive, and there is always the danger of volcanic eruptions and earthquakes. Therefore, it has strengthened its ambitions for aggression, and China, with its abundant products and vast territory, is the first to bear the brunt. Asking for and taking whatever it wants, it has achieved today's situation, which is not the result of just one morning or evening. I still remember the Sino-Japanese War. After the Japanese pirates occupied Korea, they were arrogant and looked down on everything. The Shishi Shinpo, a newspaper in their country at the time, once published a picture. The picture was of two goddesses holding wheels in battle, heroic and not yielding to men. This referred to Japan and England. In the middle of the two goddesses stood two children in adoration, referring to China and Korea. What was China's position? What was Korea's position? With absolutely unequal positions, the Japanese actually viewed them with the same eyes. Their desire to destroy China had been clearly revealed decades ago. Recently, since the September 18th Incident, the Japanese pirates have rampaged, burning, looting, killing, and doing everything imaginable. Every time they occupy a place, their newspapers noisily report it, thinking it is a great plan, and they issue extra editions to sell along the streets, like thunder. A certain newspaper even published a caricature, depicting a demon standing behind a child covered in wounds, while a man in a wide robe and wooden clogs holds a sword, killing the demon and comforting the child, like a father or elder brother to a younger sibling. Indeed, our country's warlords, fighting for power and profit, with endless wars, are a demon at work. China's internal and external troubles, with disasters occurring one after another, are nothing less than a body covered in wounds. Seeing this picture, how can we not be shocked? Will China willingly accept the protection of the Japanese? Or will we strive to protect ourselves? Our countrymen must decide. The moment of survival is at hand. How can we not be vigilant?</p>
<h3>World Snippets</h3>
<p>— Haike</p>
<p>Novel Alarm Clocks Westerners have to drink a cup of tea or coffee every morning. Wealthy men and women only have to open their eyes, and male and female servants will bring tea trays and let them drink comfortably in bed. As for ordinary bachelors who have no wives or servants, since no one wakes them up at the appropriate time, how can they have tea and coffee to drink? Therefore, they have to think of a way to save themselves. Recently, the Inventions Exhibition in London displayed a pair of novel alarm clocks. It is not known which inventor who sympathized with bachelors invented them. The function of this new alarm clock is not only to wake you up from your sleep, but also to make tea for you to drink. You only need to turn on the mechanism at night before going to bed, and at the prescribed time the next morning, the electric current will ignite the gas stove. A pot of water has already been placed on the stove, and tea leaves or coffee have been automatically placed in the teapot. After a while, the water in the pot boils and the tea is made. Then the bell rings loudly, not only urging you to get up, but also reporting that the tea is ready and you can get up to drink it. How convenient are these new inventions? They can truly be regarded as a bachelor's good helper.</p>
<h3>Strange News of a Chaste Woman Committing Suicide After Being Jilted</h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>I recently received a letter from a friend in Hangzhou, describing the strange event of a chaste woman committing suicide by hanging herself in Dongmuwu, near Liuxia. I am now transcribing it below.</p>
<p>Dongmuwu is located under Daling Mountain, with clear mountains and beautiful waters and tea trees everywhere. There are more than a hundred households. A certain Zhang plants dozens of acres of tea. His family is well-off. A woman from Ganxi, near Minwu, was married to him. She was quite beautiful and gentle. Zhang spent all day with her in the boudoir, unwilling to leave her for a moment. Over time, he became weak and frail. He died the following year, leaving his wife behind. At the time of the coffin, the woman wept bitterly over the corpse, wishing to die with him. She was stopped after being comforted by relatives. From then on, she abandoned cosmetics and spoke little, working diligently to raise her orphaned child. Therefore, everyone in the family regarded her as a chaste woman.</p>
<p>Because the woman had many fields and few people, she needed help. She hired a certain Shao from the same village as a long-term worker. Shao was young and strong and worked very diligently. He originally had a wife, but he sold her due to poverty and supported himself by working. When Zhang's wife died, she felt deep affection for her husband and was bound by the moral teachings, so she restrained herself and did not dare to be licentious. Later, she felt lonely and bitter, and there was no one to comfort her. Gradually, she became unwilling to sleep alone. Shao saw through her secret feelings and took the opportunity to seduce her. Over time, she was bewitched and fell in love with him. So they were master and servant by day and husband and wife by night, whispering sweet nothings to each other, regretting that they had not met sooner. But on the surface, they still wore the mask of chastity. Outsiders, seeing how deeply she loved her husband when he was in his coffin, did not suspect that she had changed her mind halfway through and continued to praise her.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Shao was insidious. He not only lusted after her beauty, but also coveted her wealth. When they first met, they vowed to be together. They worked tirelessly, hoping to win her favor. The woman had been parched for so long and finally received sweet rain, as if she had been anesthetized. Seeing that she had fallen into his trap, Shao made excuses to borrow money. The woman was afraid of displeasing him and obeyed his every command. After the money was exhausted, she continued with jewelry. After the jewelry was used up, she sold the field property. But the family's wealth was limited, and the desires were difficult to fill. For several years, all of Zhang's estate, both movable and immovable, was consumed by Shao alone. Then, because his repeated requests were not granted, he knew that the money had been exhausted. Shao then went away on some pretext, avoiding seeing her.</p>
<p>After losing her love, Zhang's wife tried to find Shao's whereabouts, hoping to continue their old love. She was like a drunkard all day long. Then, the black curtain of false chastity was torn down. The relatives' usual respect for her turned into contempt. She soon learned that Shao had found a new lover and was spending his honeymoon. Because the woman had been confused by him for several years, she had not only lost her body, but also lost her wealth. Her reputation was ruined. She was filled with regret and shame. She did not care about her face and went to Shao's house to question him. But Shao had heard the news and had fled far away with his new lover. At this point, Zhang's wife was in a dilemma and had the thought of being tired of the world. So she sneaked into Shao's house and hanged herself. In the evening, Shao returned and was greatly shocked by the sight. He asked someone to go to Ganxi to invite her mother. After mediation, a ceremony was held for three days, and he provided a coffin to atone for his past sins. Thus, the strange news of a chaste woman committing suicide after being jilted spread throughout the village.</p>
<h3>A Record of Jade Purity and Ice Cleanliness</h3>
<p>— Sun</p>
<p>Many of the capital's singers come from famous families. Because they are heartbroken by the difficulty of maintaining their purity and have suffered the pain of war and separation, they have no choice but to use the songs they learned in their boudoirs to sell their art to support their parents. This can also hurt themselves. As far as I know, the singer Ding Meiyu of Feilong Pavilion is from a prominent family in Qiantang, who lived in the Xizi Lake. Her father was a military officer and had made many military achievements. Unfortunately, due to a certain incident, he was imprisoned. From then on, the prison officers were respected, and the general's life was cheap. The iron windows were long at night, and there was little hope of release. Therefore, in addition to writing letters to redeem his sins, Meiyu also thought that her brother had not yet achieved fame and could not be burdened with the cost of rice, and that her mother was old and dared not seek a day's pleasure. Therefore, in a helpless situation, she made a plan for compromise. Fortunately, she had a skill in the pear garden, which was better than finding a fortune teller. So the whole family moved to Beijing, making a living by singing in the brothel. Although this matter is close to selling art, it is also equivalent to selling literature. There is no suspicion of licentious or transgressive behavior, and there is also the meaning of filial piety. My friend Tiankou Weng, in addition to listening to the songs, gave her a couplet: "Mulan feeds the horse, Ti Ying petitions the emperor, her virtues protect the sacred fungus, her kindness touches the Three Bamboo Compassionate Clouds, turning into the fragrance of a beautiful woman's herbs." "A robe of plain silk, a zither of flying jade, her jade face blooms like a full moon, willing to wash away the golden dust of the Six Dynasties, she is originally jade pure and ice clean."</p>
<h3>Short News</h3>
<p>— Xin Quan</p>
<p>The famous play "The Coiwinal Cold," written by the great playwright Martin Falevin, was performed on the New York stage for a year and won the coveted Drama League Award. It was then made into a film and transported to Shanghai, where it opened at the Nanjing Grand Theater. It has special features that the stage cannot have and is the most magical sad love film. Its layout is purely novelistic, emphasizing performance and plot, and there is not much dialogue. It can profoundly depict the pain of sacrificing love. The background is excellent. The jailbreak scene, with machine guns firing, is shocking and unparalleled. The great star Hess Deng plays the judge, who is extremely harsh and vividly portrayed. Philip Fomos plays Hanker, who is particularly rich in inner performance. The trial judge's daughter, Constance, also performs well. The other characters are all quite watchable. The director of this film, Hawke, is commendable for his faithful translation and for giving people a great stimulus.</p>
<p>Statement A section was omitted from the article "The Mother of Thought" the other day. It is now supplemented as follows.</p>
<p>"To walk without feeling difficulty is a mediocre person. To not even move one's feet but create thousands of difficulties in one's heart is a presumptuous person. To walk and feel difficulty and then want to solve this difficulty and not stop until the difficulty is solved is a scientist."</p>

<h3>The Country Bumpkin Goes to Shanghai Again (16)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>That black "Ce Lao" (ticket inspector) was wearing a suit of white clothes. With a black face, a pair of yellow eyes, and two rows of white teeth, he really looked like a ghost. The country bumpkin thought: This brother of Zhang Fei, elder brother of Zhou Cang, I wonder what he's doing on the tram? I'll have to take a closer look.</p>
<p>He saw that the "Ce Lao" got on the tram without saying a word, and checked the passengers' tickets one by one. Many passengers had different ways of keeping their little tickets. Some held them in their hands, some stuffed them in their hats, some clipped them in their ears, and some held them in their mouths. The "Ce Lao" silently checked them one by one, and then disappeared like a ghost.</p>
<p>"That's what they call a 'Ce Lao'." The country bumpkin figured he'd learned another trick today.</p>
<p>"Sanma Road is here, please get off." This was the ticket seller giving a special greeting to the country bumpkin. Otherwise, ticket sellers never announce the stops to passengers. If you miss your stop, it's none of their business, and you have to pay for an extra ticket.</p>
<p>And when the country bumpkin got off the tram, he even pointed him in a direction and said, "Walk west, it's not many shops, it's the Grand Theater." After saying that, the tram went ding-ding-dang-dang and headed south again.</p>
<p>The country bumpkin listened to the ticket seller's directions and indeed walked west a few steps. By then it was already evening, and the electric lights on the road were shining brightly. Cars, carriages, rickshaws, bicycles, collapsible carts, and small carts were all squeezing the pedestrians. The country bumpkin managed to squeeze through, and he soon saw the three large characters "Grand Theater." Now he couldn't help but hesitate. He still remembered that his nephew A-Mulin had told him he was in the Meilan Lane in the French Concession, so how had he ended up at the Grand Theater? He had no idea if this place was the French Concession, so how did they say A-Mulin was here? And my photo is across from the Grand Theater?</p>
<p>At this time, the Grand Theater was in the middle of seating, and many men and women with syphilis (Note 5) were entering the theater one after another. There was also a group of "anmu" (ticket touts) carrying stacks of theater programs. When they saw someone walking from afar at the entrance, they didn't care if they were coming to see the show or not and shouted in unison. When they saw someone wearing glasses, they would shout: "Glasses! Glasses! Someone with glasses is coming!" When they saw someone wearing a long gown, they would call: "Long gown! Long gown! Someone in a long gown is coming!" Whoever shouted first would go to greet them, and they would be considered their customer.</p>
<p>The country bumpkin was looking around when the touts thought he was also coming to see the show. One of the touts coughed:</p>
<p>"A-Mulin! A-Mulin! A-Mulin is here!" As he spoke, he winked at the person next to him.</p>
<p>The country bumpkin was very surprised. He thought his nephew was really here.</p>
<p>(Note 5) In recent times, those who satirize Mei Lanfang call him Mei Du (梅毒, which sounds like "syphilis").</p>

<h3>Financial: Gold Prices Soar</h3>
<p>Short Covering Due to Approaching Settlement</p>
<p>The gold price continued its rapid rise. Yesterday, the 13th, the benchmark gold price again showed a sharp increase, with volatile waves.  There was no firm grip on the market, with both rising and falling periods. There were a total of 22 taels recalled from the previous market, ultimately rebounding by more than 20 taels. This was mainly due to the approaching settlement date, with the bulls trying to push the price higher and the shorts having to cover their positions.  Furthermore, the scarce inventory of physical gold contributed to a bullish sentiment among dealers, resulting in demand exceeding supply in the market. The silver market report did not have any impact, likely because the European market turned soft, and Citibank had been selling.  Therefore, the market opened high, then weakened slightly, before rising again. As for foreign exchange, it was apparently loose but secretly tight, eventually exceeding 610 taels, but with fluctuations, hovering around 10 taels. The after-market once reached beyond 20 taels, but unexpectedly, a sudden storm arose. The exchange rate rose and then fell, with sellers on the floor acting swiftly.  Rumors of escalating conflict in the Heilongjiang province caused a plunge of 10 taels, eventually stabilizing at the end.</p>
<p>A Frenzied Jump at the Opening</p>
<p>The market jumped wildly from the very beginning, rising 13.7 mace to 606.5 taels. The large silver bars rose another 11/16, and forward silver rose 6/8. The silver price increased by 7/8, but buyers were satisfied and unmoved. The Ningbo guild, as well as Tongtaichang, Fuyu, and others, were selling. The price then dropped from 607 taels to 600 taels, followed by a rebound of 6 taels, as Hengchangyong and others bought in, and the exchange rate appeared firm. The closing exchange rate for U.S. dollars was 36.875 to 36.75, and for British pounds it was initially 11 pence 4375. Then, banks absorbed at the same price. However, the posted rate for British pounds had already increased by 1 pence, and the U.S. dollar by 1.5 yuan. This was due to the small exchange rate reported between the U.K. and the U.S. At 02:30, Fuyu, Fuchang, Yuanxing, Yongqian, Changxiang, and others all entered the market, and HSBC also bought British pounds for December at 11 pence 4375. As a result, the gold price soared, increasing by 10 and 9.5/100ths taels, to 13.5 taels. In an instant, within ten minutes, it plunged 6 taels, because British pounds for February were still settling at 375. In addition, Hengyu, Zhifengyong, Tongtaichang, Shunli, and others sold until 10:00, reaching 607.5 mace. After entering the market, it rose more than 4 taels, almost with British pound banks mutually doing 3125, and the U.S. dollar at 36.5 yuan. Especially Hengxing, Yuanwanxing, Shunli, Tianfengyong, Yongchengfengyong, and others were competing to buy, reaching 11.8 taels around 11:00.

<h3>Interest Rates Suddenly Turn Bullish</h3>
<p>Market Overview</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, in the market, the banks, realizing that the previous day’s interest rate was too low, raised their rates in succession, causing the price to suddenly turn bullish, differing from the previous day’s noon market price by as much as 2 li, which cannot be said to be a small market movement. As for the situation of silver funds, the morning was particularly tight, but in the afternoon, banks had deposit funds that could be used to make head starts, and the situation became more relaxed, so the head start was too loose, and the situation became peaceful.</p>

<p>Subsidiary Coin Market Situation</p>
<p>Jiangnan small silver coins were 6 qian 5 fen 2 li in the morning market, which was half a li more than the previous day. In the noon market, due to the scarcity of transactions, the price was the same as in the morning. There were 5,000 jiao of transactions made in the morning market and 2,500 jiao in the noon market.</p>
<p>Guangdong small silver coins were also both 6 qian 5 fen in the morning and noon markets, which was half a li less than the previous day’s noon market. There were 140,000 jiao of transactions made in the morning market and 35,000 jiao in the noon market.</p>

<h3>Securities Bond Prices Rebound, Market Conditions Improve</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot market for securities remained extremely scarce, with only 2,000 yuan opened for trading throughout the day. The futures market was also sluggish, with the market being depressed, large investors watching and waiting, and zero-lot investors entering and exiting sparsely. The market situation became increasingly bleak. It was estimated that about 2.9 million were opened in the morning and over 2.4 million in the afternoon, for a total of only 5.325 million yuan. Bond prices still had no major fluctuations, and the sluggish situation increased throughout the day. Since buying and selling were extremely scarce, people were discouraged, and supply and demand were not likely to have major fluctuations. However, although buyers had no huge investments, sporadic refills were not lonely. On the other hand, sellers were silent, and not only did speculators dare not sell short, but even those with goods were still quietly waiting for opportunities and unwilling to sell off at low prices. In this depressed state, bond prices actually rebounded slightly, opening up five or six jiao or so in the early morning and then continuing to firm up. As a result, the 19 Customs and troop reduction monthly issues both rose by more than one yuan, and others also mostly rose by eight or nine jiao. Only the 96 Salt Tax and the Six-Series fell. Judging from the bond market situation, it has been in a state of uncertainty since the beginning of this week, and today it is unlikely to have major fluctuations.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cloth Market: Retailers Covering Shorts</h3>
<p>The yarn market turned firm as retailers covered shorts. The rising gold price led to bullish sentiment, and the market atmosphere suddenly tightened, with renewed counter-movements. However, silver funds remained tight, and the actual demand was bleak. All guilds had no solutions, and the disturbances in the Northeast caused uneasiness. The situation was not seen as greatly positive, it is said.</p>
<p>Man-Mark Yarn Prices Rise</p>
<p>The opening market for man-mark yarn prices in the previous session was firmer due to retailers covering shorts, and the atmosphere was tighter. Prices for all months rose by 1 tael 4 mace to 9 mace. The situation remained firm in the afternoon, and prices for all months rose again by 1.4.5 mace. Transaction statistics totaled 25,800 bales. It was found that Taixing sold 2,700 bales, Yongchang 650 bales, and Yiyu 1,100 bales. Tongyu bought 1,150 bales, and Yi Da 2,005 bales. The closing prices are listed on the left:</p>

Among customer guilds, 135 bales entered the mainland, 85 bales entered Sichuan, 100 bales entered Changsha, 30 bales entered Shantou, and 65 bales entered miscellaneous trades, it is said.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Slightly Firm</h3>
<p>The cotton market was slightly firm as the gold price turned bullish and sentiment rose. However, the foreign cotton situation was very weak, so foreign cotton prices remained cheap, resulting in a complete halt to transactions in local cotton. All factories had no intention of inquiring, but the Ningbo guild had a strong intention to buy. The Hankou guild and a certain cotton merchant held tightly and did not release, so the market rose slightly. However, judging from the overall trend, it was difficult to be optimistic.</p>
<p>Hankou Mark Rises Three or Four Mace</p>
<p>The opening market for Hankou mark in the previous session was that the gold price was trending upward and foreign cotton was stable. Prices for all months rose by 2 mace to 1 mace 5 fen. Ningbo bought in the afternoon, and prices rose. Prices for all months rose by 1 mace 5 fen to 2 mace. The total transaction statistics for the day were 75,300 dan.

<h3>American Cotton Flat and Tired</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was initially firm due to traders buying and sellers lacking, but later became tired due to some bulls closing out positions. It was estimated that futures rose or fell by 1 to 3 points, and spot prices fell by 5 points. British cotton futures rose by 3 points, and spot prices rose by 4 points. Egyptian spot prices rose by 10 points. Indian cotton was bought by Japanese traders and sold by European exporters. Market conditions were firm due to the low American exchange rate. It was estimated that Pingguoer rose by 3.5 rupees, Aomura rose by 4.25 rupees, and Bailuoxi rose by 2.5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram from the 12th):</p>
<p>American Cotton Compared to Previous Day, Combined Shanghai Standard; British Cotton Compared to Previous Day, Combined Shanghai Standard</p>
<p>December: 652, Down 3, 23.70; 1, 476, Up 3, 27.10</p>

<h3>Grains: The River Market Rice: Tight and Then Soft</h3>
<p>At Nantou yesterday, the rice market remained in a stagnant state. There were very few people visiting the market in the early morning. The source of Suchang new japonica rice and Tongli Pingwang Lixia and other goods remained strong. At the opening of the market in the early morning, each was 2 jiao lower. By the afternoon, it turned stable. There was not much trading in Qingjiao, Fenglian, and Baoye varieties. The short variety was 1 jiao lower. Secondary goods from Jinze and Luxu arrived, and sales were weak with no rise or fall. Yangdu jiansha boat offices went to 300 bags. The price was high. There was no honor or disgrace for Xu Yinyuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, at Xinzha, only 30+ rice boats of various types entered the port. The thick Xin-Jing rice was the strongest among the local transactions, and the large-plate items stood firm. The secondary color was softly falling by 2 jiao. The amount of Kakuli, Shipu, Sijing thin rice and Lian Tang and other goods arriving was small, and the trading was extremely light. Compared to the previous sales, it fell by 2 or 3 jiao. Kunshan and Jiangyin rice slightly had rice stacked, about 1,000 stones or so. According to a survey at 2:30 pm yesterday, there were about 250 rice boats along the Hengfeng Bridge and the Garbage Bridge area, with a total of about 22,500 dan of japonica rice and other goods.</p>
<h3>Spot Foreign Rice Continues to Be Digested in This Street</h3>
<p>Foreign companies continue to dump futures rice... prices are again weak.</p>
<p>Yesterday, spot foreign rice continued to be inquired about and traded in this street, and the market conditions were quite active. However, the market could not turn around for a while, due to the decline caused by futures. Throughout the day, 2,500 bags of No. 1 Saigon were sold at a price of 11.5 to 11.4 yuan, and 300 bags of small twisted rice were sold at a price of 10.02 to 10.015 yuan, all of which were handled by this street. The Tianjin gang had quite a lot of intention to handle the business, because the port was short of grain, but because the public security in the current situation was not very safe, they did not dare to rashly handle the loading. Foreign companies continued to dump futures, and the market trend was increasingly weak. Yesterday, foreign companies sold another 4,000 tons of small twisted rice, calculated at 4 months at 4.75 taels and 5 months at 5 taels, and the price was smaller than before. The main buyers were the Mainland Gang, it is said.</p>
<h3>Flour Prices Fall and Rise Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the market for each month showed a consistent sharp decline. As the gold price situation gradually worsened, and the price of foreign wheat suddenly decreased by six, seven, or eight jiao, the impact of such a continuous decline in the future would naturally be huge. If it were more visible when foreign wheat was smoothly settled, the impact would be even more considerable. The market was still low but only fell by about 2 fen compared to the previous day, but the sentiment for the distant period was relatively weaker (the lowest price for April was 2.05 taels). When the market opened in the afternoon, the gold market rebounded, and the Nanyang gang still absorbed slightly. The near and far terms rose by one or two fen compared to the morning. As a result, the current month did not move, November was up by 5 li, December was up by 5 li, March was up by 2.5 li, and April was down by 5 li, it is said.</p>
<h3>Wheat: Soft in the Morning, Stable at Noon</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the futures wheat market in the morning, each month again tended to be sluggish, as the price of foreign wheat fell by about six, seven, or eight jiao. This kind of state seemed to contradict the expectations of most people. Because the gold market was unstable, people inside and outside the industry felt increasingly indifferent. The opening price for the current month immediately decreased to 3.65 taels, and the distant term was also decreased by 3 to 4 fen or so. However, the actual goods were not smooth, so the market atmosphere relied on this to be stable. When the market opened in the afternoon, the soaring gold market also saw sentiment rebound. Because most of those who settled foreign wheat at a time of unrest did not dare to observe and dump their holdings, and the scarcity of goods being dumped was not difficult to imagine. Therefore, in the subsequent steps, it may be possible to see the market stabilize for the time being because of this. As a result, the current month was down by 2 fen compared to the previous day, December was up by 1 fen, January was up by 2 fen, and March and April were down by 1 fen, it is said.</p>
<h3>Zhabei Goods, Copper Coins, Bubble Coins Have Already Been Released</h3>
<p>The Quanzhou large bubble Gui yuan coins were previously due to the fact that the return prices of various firms were too outrageous, and the two sides had been in stalemate for nearly a week. Recently, they have gradually approached, and yesterday it was heard that half of the upstream had been released, smaller by three taels or so compared to before, but the price was better than before it was released by one or two taels. However, according to the Quanzhou telegraph, the land price was unable to relax, and the market may be able to turn stable, it is said.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: No Major Changes in Overseas Silk Market</h3>
<p>There is Trading but No Market… Truly Lacking New News to Record</p>
<p>The overseas raw silk market is affected by economic unease. Raw silk factories have no sales, and silk prices have no major changes, and are of the variety that have trades but no market. Recently, in January, the New York market has had Standard period silk (i.e. Japanese silk) on the silk exchange fluctuate by a few American cents per pound, with no fluctuations in silk prices. The depression of the Chinese and foreign silk markets is at its extreme, and there is truly a lack of new news to record, it is said.</p>
<h3>Tunxi Zhen Mei Has Already Been Motivated</h3>
<p>Since the invasion of the Eastern provinces by the violent Japanese army, the foreign tea market in this port has shown a steep decline due to the serious situation and the soaring leading rate. In recent days, Pingshui Zhucha and Luzhuang Zhenmei green tea have had sporadic sales. Yesterday, Tunxi Zhenmei, Tongfu, Jinlong, Xiehe and other firms all showed a trend of movement, and the price was opened at 80-90 taels, 2-3 taels lower than before. The market already has movement, but Wuyuan Gaozhuang goods are still sluggish, it is said.</p>

<h3>Hardware Industry Competes by Cutting Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, hardware transactions were quite sluggish. Although various businesses in the industry tried their best to lower prices and peddle their goods everywhere, they were ultimately exhausted due to the large amount of goods and slow sales. Moreover, with a continuous supply and increasing inventory, morale is low. Therefore, the future trend seems uncertain. However, if the supply of tinplate, black iron sheet, and white iron tile runs out and there is a slight breakthrough, the market may regain a better outlook.</p>

<h3>Gu Angru Translates Marshal Foch's European War Diary</h3>
<p>I also requested General Haller, the commander-in-chief of the Polish army, to allow the Polish First Division to participate in the offensive.</p>
<p>As such, thanks to the efforts of all the officers and soldiers, the Laurence offensive was quickly and properly arranged. The 28th Infantry Division and the 3rd Cavalry Division, under the cover of a large artillery corps and 600 tanks, were prepared to launch an offensive on November 14th. The battle line was 20 miles long and would be closely connected to the fiercely bombarded 200-mile battle line. However, this front had new objectives but no strong enemy, so it was expected to conquer dozens of miles in one battle. Beyond this lay a desolate disaster area, which greatly hindered the Allied advance. The troops in this direction could then join forces to attack, in order to advance on the Rhine and directly attack Berlin. If our army advanced along this route, the final victory of the war could be secured.</p>
<p>At the beginning of November, the line from Valenciennes to Ghent and the Scheldt River formed the barrier of the Allied left wing, while the strong defenses of the Selle River on the Chambrai front formed the barrier of our central forces.</p>
<p>The American First Army and the French Fourth Army advanced on the left bank of the Meuse River, which was enough to outflank the Selle River line from the east. The French First Army and the British right wing attacked the line of the Scheldt River from the south, north of the Sensée River. The French Flanders Army Group took Ghent from the north.</p>
<p>I anticipated important developments in the north, so I moved my headquarters from Bombon to Saint-Lyé on October 18th. Now, it was only necessary to proceed uninterruptedly according to the predetermined strategy. The stalemate that our army had been forced into came to an end at the end of October.</p>
<p>From November 1st to 5th, the American First Army and the French Fourth Army successfully outflanked and advanced to the line of Les Islettes-Buzancy-Stonne. The British right wing, under the cover of the Deprez corps, also advanced to Iwuy-Philippeville. On the 5th and 6th, our army completely occupied the line of the Selle River.</p>
<p>I had a consultation with Marshal Haig about this. I asked him that when the British right wing advanced, he should withdraw the British Second Army, which was temporarily attached to the Flanders Army Group, to take charge of the left wing and redeploy his forces. I told him that if he wanted the Flanders Army Group to succeed, the British Second Army could not be moved until it had recovered Belgium up to the Scheldt River.</p>
<p>In fact, the Flanders Army Group had already reached the upper reaches of the Scheldt River and Ghent on November 1st, and the British Second Army was transferred back to Marshal Haig on November 4th. I then notified King Albert of Belgium on November 2nd.</p>
<p>After several victories, the French Flanders Army Group had advanced to the upper reaches of the Scheldt River and Ghent. In the future, the main battle for attacking the Scheldt River defense line would be undertaken by the British army southwest of Valenciennes. Therefore, all British troops should be under the command of the British Commander-in-Chief. Marshal Foch earnestly requested King Albert to transfer the British Second Army back to Marshal Haig's direct command from November 4th.</p>
<p>At that time, in view of the victory of the French First Army between October 24th and 27th, I wrote to Marshal Haig on October 27th, saying,</p>
<p>"The Deprez corps is progressing smoothly. The main force of the British army can contact the French First Army to attack towards the objectives of Mons, Iwuy, and La Chaussée."</p>
<p>On October 29th, Marshal Haig ordered his Fourth, Third, and Thirteenth Corps to prepare to attack again on November 3rd, but the attack only began on the 4th. The French First Army provided cover, resulting in a complete victory.</p>
<p>The German army was repeatedly wounded, and with the continuous advance of the French and American armies on the left wing, the German defense line wavered. On the 5th, a large-scale retreat began between the Mons Canal and the Esnes River. After this, the Meuse River front also wavered.</p>
<p>On the 8th, the Franco-Belgian forces of the Flanders Army Group occupied the crossings of the Scheldt River between Eecke and Audenarde. Hearing the news, the enemy troops retreated even more fiercely. The enemy had implemented a general retreat from the Dutch border to Haute-Sambre on the Meuse River.</p>
<p>The Allied forces pursued closely, hoping to take the Rhine River in one fell swoop and disintegrate the enemy forces, due to the natural barrier of the Rhine River.</p>

<p>The German government is now preparing to negotiate on the basis of President Wilson's speech to Congress on January 8, 1918, and subsequent speeches such as that on September 27, 1918. Finally, the German government, due to the urgent domestic situation, requested the conclusion of an immediate armistice treaty on land, sea, and air.</p>
<p>President Wilson issued a reply on October 8th, arguing that the immediate withdrawal of German troops from the occupied areas should be a prerequisite for the conclusion of an armistice treaty.</p>
<p>On the same day (October 8th), I first voluntarily notified Mr. Clemenceau of the obligations that the enemy army should bear. These obligations were based on the following three principles:</p>
<p>If the following conditions are not accepted, there will be no ceasefire for the troops within Belgium and France.</p>
<p>1.  Restore countries that have been occupied in violation of international law, such as Belgium, France, Alsace-Lorraine, and Luxembourg, and return their residents. As the enemy army must withdraw within 15 days and immediately send residents back to their hometowns, this is the first condition for the armistice.</p>
<p>2.  Our army must guarantee the occupation of a considerable military starting point base in preparation for resuming the war and annihilating the enemy in the event of a breakdown of peace negotiations. Our army must occupy two or three bridgeheads on the Rhine River (the bridgeheads must form a semicircle on the right bank, with a radius of 18 and 3/4 miles). This must also be implemented within 15 days, which is the second condition for the armistice.</p>
<p>3.  Occupy collateral for compensation. The amount of compensation will be proposed during peace negotiations. Therefore, the enemy army must withdraw from the left bank of the Rhine River within 30 days, and the Allied forces will occupy it and manage it jointly with the local authorities until the conclusion of the peace treaty. This is the third condition for the armistice.</p>
<p>There are also additional conditions as follows:</p>
<p>4.  Military equipment that the German army cannot remove within the time limit must be left behind and not destroyed.</p>
<p>5.  Troops that cannot be fully withdrawn within the time limit must be disarmed and considered prisoners of war.</p>
<p>6.  Railway materials must be left behind and not destroyed. All vehicles occupied in Belgium and France should be returned immediately.</p>
<p>7.  All military buildings │barracks, arsenals, munitions factories│ must be maintained as they are and left behind, and no objects should be taken away or destroyed.</p>
<p>8.  The same applies to industrial buildings and various factories.</p>
<p>9.  The war will cease within 24 hours after the above conditions are approved by the contracting countries. (To be continued)</p>
