<p>（巴黎）　國聯行政會今日工作頗忙、以整理其滿洲議案、希望於星期六日提交行政會全體公開大會、覓取一致同意、如美滿通過、則滿洲調查委員即可指派、而國聯解决中日間爭端之工作、暫可告一段落、行政會小股委員會現正考慮星期六日開行政會最後會議時議長白里安所須發表之演詞、大約將述全案之槪略而表示國聯所採之地位、聞演詞係哲理性質、而作槪括的結論、日代表今日已贊成起草委員會所擬定之草案、但對於議長關於提案之批評、尙有不同意之點已提出對案、交起草委員會考慮、聞對案與滿洲治匪之警政有關、苟此對案通過、則日代表將請其政府接受此提案與批評、今日行政會集議至晚七時三十五分始止、其所討論之主要點、爲滿洲調查團之職務、起草委員會定明晨十一時再集會、考慮議長關於調查團之宣言細則、明晚六時行政會將再集議、議案導言之詞句、現已通過者、已將原有文字加以修正、庶可引起中日間之將來談判、導言說明議案中某項條欵之範圍與關係、如滿洲警政與盜匪等是、日代表所不同意者即在某種說明、但衆意日代表所已提出之對案、並不妨害導言中之言論、施博士態度、對於草案甚爲溫和、預料南京當不致發生若何困難、聞行政會主張指派國際著聞之頭等人物爲滿洲調查委員、在此案正式提交行政會最後會議以前、白里安將說明其法律上意味、（一日路透社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　中代表今日將中國答覆十一月二十七日日本關於津事要求之要點、通知國聯秘書長、中國復文略謂、前已迭次聲明中國僅採行預防便衣隊之戒備計畫、絕對非仇視日本、想日本定可完全了解中國始終友好之態度、希望雙方停止可引起誤會之行動、華兵現已撤至距城二十里之處、地方警察負責維持治安、如依日本要求、撤退警察、則中外人生命財產、保護無人、故希望日本了解此種困難、但若因各友邦地方當道之聯合努力、若定維持治安之有效辦法、則中國準備考慮撤退之、中國當道已發命令、禁止民衆仇日行動云、（一日路透社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　起草委員會今晨十一時集議、修正白里安閉會時之演詞、並處理滿洲調查委員團問題、行政會會員昨有數人要求參加調查委員團、意國且以意國被選爲必要條件、聞行政會已决定委員團人數不得過五人、如第四人爲意人、則第五人應從小國内選出之、巴黎日誌報批評此事、謂意國旣堅决欲自爲調查委員、遂發生嚴重困難、第一因意國公然主張修改條約、第二意國旣要求加入、德國或將效法、德國固主張廢除不平等條約也、意代表謝樂嘉現已宣布意國選定駐以巴西大使塞魯惕博士爲參加調查委員團之意代表、因塞博士熟悉中國事也、該報又謂昨日行政會會議時、西班牙與南美代表皆表示調查委員團應有七人或九人之議、故　擬調查委員團五人一節、現尙未切實决定云、法國報紙預料滿洲問題本星期總可結束、錦州問題糾紛仍在、日人指錦州華兵多係新近到者、今日兵雖已停止前進、而前鋒現已撤回瀋陽、但錦州華兵猶未撤退、日政府以爲華兵之不撤退華人將視爲勝利、今日芳澤請白里安注意於因中國不依原約將其軍隊撤至團内而將發生之危險事態、芳澤此次未發恫嚇之言、但一再聲明解决之必要、（二日路透社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　本日午前起草委員會又復開會、其大部份工作業已竣事、現所致力者係調查委員團之細目、委員共有五人、頃已證實、計法英美意四國各一人、意藉委員係該國駐巴西大使塞魯惕、此人通曉中國情形、異於儕輩、至第五委員經荷蘭國提出候選人、各小國均持異議、謂當以瑞士人比利時人或瑞典人充任、决議案全文業於昨日午後送達雙方事國代表、本日之内或明日當可答復報可、最後會議或須俟至星期六日仍可舉行、原因施肇基在巴黎　作談話、與顧維鈞在南京所作談話、較之此間所見不無出入之處、行政院因恐他日解釋錯誤、欲將調查團曁中立區域兩問題明白指陳、不使稍涉含混、庶得良好效果云、（二日哈瓦斯社電）　　（巴黎）　素以消息靈通見稱之紐約紀事報巴黎刋今日載稱、國聯理事會所草决議案、共有六項、（一）重　確定理事會九月三十日决議案之撤兵規定、（二）當事國雙方負有莊嚴義務、禁止易致釀成喪失生命之任何行動、（三）中日應將東三省一應發展、隨時報告理事會、（四）中日應將關於爭執上之一應重要消息、供給理事會、（五）派遣調查委員五人及專家若干、（六）在理事會明年一月間開會以前、請白里安密切注意事態之發展　遇必要時隨即召集特别會議、又　巴黎人報今晨載稱、决議案前有小序、將鄭重聲明此次爭執、係有特殊情形、爲一非常案件、理事會之决議、不應視作今後任何爭執之先例、（二日國民社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　起草委員會今日午後一時前散會、未曾决定何國應加入調查委員團問題、行政會會員所請在遠東無直接關係之小國代表應加入一人一節、似覺言之成理、此事將由今晚集議之行政會决定之、錦州問題又成要點、行政會切欲在閉會以前將中立區域問題切實辦妥、蓋知兩者之間苟無緩衝、則終有發生糾紛之危險也、（二日路透社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　行政院内中立區域問題、中國代表因恐日軍進展、要求予以保證、此項保證當由美英法三國會同擔任、其細目正在商訂、中立區域内警察職務、當由中國人員執行、而由地方民治官吏監督、此層業已　實、（一日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　英法官塲視察員報告兩日前之錦州局勢、此項報告、已送交國聯秘書處、法人報告謂某種報告所載關於錦州與秦皇島草軍佈防之消息、全無根據、英人報告稱、錦州事態如常、人過商業停頓、稅收大减耳、中東鐵路未因裝運日兵四十人由長春往哈爾濱領署一事發生糾紛、法人又謂聞日軍司令已决定將所有軍隊撤至南滿鐵路區域之内、惟在齊齊哈爾留兩大隊、吉林長春與新民對面之遼河各留日兵一大隊云、中代表團致國聯一文、報告若干無關重要之事件、其中最重要者、爲日兵八百名出現於秦皇島、而在該地掘壕佈防事、（二日路透社電）</p>
<h3>日官塲對中立區意見</h3>
<p>竟不容錦州省府存在</p>
<p>（東京）　察今日官塲發言人對於設立中立區域事而表示之意見、似滿洲難題覓求解决之工作中、又起新困難、官塲發言人謂中國僅將軍隊撤入關内、尚屬不充分、必張學良之錦州政府亦撤退而後可云　發言人又說明其意、謂有若干方面對於外務省所發日本準備將中立區域内民政留於華人之手中一語、顯然誤會、日</p>
<p>日本準備容許張學良之政府留於錦州、但僅謂錦州政府所屬各城鎭之地方民政耳、若張學良仍留政府於錦州、則勢必使時局緊張、因張將以此爲滿洲境内之根據地、以指揮匪徒仇日之活動也、是以日本提議瀋陽袁金鎧政府應於錦州政府撤退之後、管理錦州云、白里安關於剿匪問題之宣言、日代表已提出保留、今行政會擬將日本所保留者、加以修正、但日本官塲仍視爲甚不滿意、據謂此項修正、將使日本時時商諸國聯、雖在有極小動作之必要時、亦須商諸國聯、再行政會議案之文字、東京認爲非必要的累贅、在日本官塲視之、且可認爲暗含滿洲中國行政傾覆、由於日人行動之意、故外務省已諭令芳澤堅持原來提出之文字、以其義較確當、而少含混也、日本所提出次要修正案、已否採用、日政府尙無所聞、故日本官塲謂最後草案、日本可否接受、尙難確言、不過似尙可抱樂觀耳云、（二日路透社電）</p>
<p>（東京）　今晨負責方面言及報載巴黎傳來關於起草委員會所擬議案之消息、謂國聯滿洲議案、如不予日本以剿匪之權、則日本不能接受之、東京尙未證實報紙消息之官塲報告、故衆意白里安關於必要的警務計畫之宣言、或可爲美滿代替物、祇須明白規定宣言與議案本身有同國聯新决議案起草完竣⊙朱光沐偕各國武官赴饒陽河通遼等處視察⊙中政會通過二十年度國家歲入歲出總槪算⊙（見國内要電）英印圓桌會議閉幕⊙（見國外要電）抗日會電外部反對中日直接交涉（見本埠新聞）</p>
<p>樣拘束力耳、（二日路透社電）</p>
<h3>俄報揭破美國遠東政策</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）　俄泊拉夫達報載有社論云、美國帝國主義在滿洲爭端所採策略、係由美國各資本大王壓迫而成、此輩之意、端在引起新戰爭、以獲取新利益　美國策略</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>具有兩項目的、其一减削日本在太平洋之勢力、其二予蘇俄以打擊、抑知此種政策、已使日美兩帝國主義相扺觸、觀於史汀生之宣言即可知之、道威斯希望日本帝國主義在滿洲北部與蘇俄發生齟齬、而使兩國關係趨於緊張、以釀成一大戰爭、美國對此戰爭不直接參加、但欲藉此戰爭以恢復其已失之繁榮、紐約交易所聞戰端可開之說、已不勝欣喜、且有利用機會以抬高若干證券及小麥之市價者、現滿洲問題已在巴黎成立妥約、而有美國在内、其内容　將日軍軍事行動之中心點移向滿洲北部、美國資產階級以爲蘇俄必將墮其挑撥技倆之中、不料此種希望竟成夢想、於是日本軍隊乃轉而南向、則美國政府謂其作法自斃、抑又何說、緣日本帝國主義在中國中部之利益與美國帝國主義之利益直接發主衝突、東京與華盛頓之爭議、足以揭破巴黎各帝國主義者秘密會商之黑幕　此輩　仙江畔所籌畫者、乃一種皮蘇俄之陰謀而已、按各帝國主義者之目的、在引起太平洋沿岸之戰爭、滿洲事變日後之發展、足使各帝國主義者意見相左、日益加甚、美國帝國主義已遭失敗、史汀生無論用何手腕、均不能加以遮掩、雖然遠東方面之戰爭危險　未可認爲業已消滅、美國帝國主義者殆目承爲戰爭之挑撥者、觀於近事、實甚顯著云云、（一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>抗日勿忘救災</h3>
<p>自九一八東北禍變突發以來。我政府與國人都焦思苦慮於抗日與自救。目光一致注射於對外。但國内之另一嚴重急迫。不亞於東北禍變之重大問題。則大都已漠然視之。或且已談然忘却。此問題爲何。即洪水泛濫下之十六省災民問題是。</p>
<p>當六七月間水災發生之初國内人士籌謀商討。捐輸賑濟。奔走呼籲極足以表現人類同情性之偉大。政府當時亦有水災救濟委員會之組設。并有發行五千萬水災公債之决議。全國輿論。全國人士之目光。都集中於災民之救濟與災區之善後。都認此爲我國家之一鉅刦。迨九一八之禍變作。於是嚮之注視國内水災之目光。一時都移而對外。於是而捐輸停。而賑務之進行滯。而五千萬公債之議無形擱置。十六省區五千萬之災黎。從茲乃希望斷絕。而愈入於呼籲無門求生無路之悲境矣。</p>
<p>歲云暮矣。朔風凛冽霜雪交侵。此五千萬鉅大數目之災黎廬舍旣隨洪水以漂流。田土亦遭狂波之衝激鳩形鵠面。瑟縮於寒風之下。旣受飢火之炙灼。復遭嚴寒之迫害。飢寒交迫。生機全斷。吾人今日試一瞑目默念此狼籍四野忍死待救之災地同胞之悲慘景象。當知際此歲暮天寒。災地同胞之救濟。萬不容忽。萬無可緩。換言之。即我輩僥倖而未直接蒙受洪流之迫害者。萬不容坐視此廣大之災地同胞之飢寒。死亡而不救濟。</p>
<p>在今日情勢之下。對外問題固爲重要。但對内之水災救濟。亦何嘗不關係我國家民族之存亡。吾人固不容一寸之國土輕易失去。但亦不容坐視爲數之鉅乃至五千萬之災黎。淪入死亡之絕境。今日外患足以亡我國。内憂亦足以亡我國。挺而走險。急何能擇。飢寒交迫。何事不可爲。何亂不可作。今冬與明春潛伏之危機。至爲重大。集五千萬奮死以求生之廣大羣衆。眞無異於不可嚮邇之燎原野火。在此野火蔓延之下。其誰能保證我國家不立即有一突變之局面發生。故當前對外問題固急。對内問題亦至爲嚴重。在整個之社會中。大多數羣衆求死不得、求生不以。絕不容一部分人之獨能安富尊榮。度其安樂之歲月。我醉飽而人飢寒。我歡笑而人悲泣。在道德之觀點上。固不應有此現象。在利害之關聯上。亦决不容有此現象。</p>
<p>政府發行五千萬水災公債之决議。今已無形擱置。吾人誠不解此種公債停頓之原因究何在。將謂外患起而内災遂可不必救濟耶。抑此五千萬人民之生死存亡。皆可聽其自然耶。嗚呼死者暴露。生者流離。此一幅慘絕人寰、呈現吾人目前之災民圖。我政府我國人詎容一日忘諸懷耶。</p>
<p>在今日吾人謹以極慘重之聲音呼籲我政府我國人。對外毌忘對内。抗暴毌忘救災。五千萬廣大羣衆之嗷嗷哀聲。正隨凛冽之寒風傳播四野。吾人試傾耳一聽。</p>

<h3>印席圓會閉幕</h3>
<p>英相宣面對印政策</p>
<p>民族問題陷於僵局</p>
<p>路透一日倫敦電　印度圓桌會議今日開最後一次會議、英相麥唐納宣佈英政府政策、其詞將以白皮書形式發表之、本星期内可提交國會兩院、聞英相謂依英政府之意見、全印聯邦乃眞正解决困難之唯一方法、英政府贊成負責中央政府之原則、但附以過渡時之保留與保障、西北省與辛德皆將改爲單獨省份、各方面多勸英政府立即實施印度各省負責政府之完全計畫、而圓桌會議亦欲有包括一切之憲章、故在此方面僅作一部分之進行、但非各代表所歡迎也、英政府在此環　之下、不欲對此作一部分之解决、惟情勢或有變遷、目前遽作不可挽回之决定、實非必要、最爲各省與中央進行之阻碍者、即爲民族問題之僵局、但政府不願承認此問題之一時的失敗有終久性質、若印人自己不能解决此事、則英政府不得已唯有適用臨時計畫耳、印度將來憲法發展中之第二步驟、須來自圓桌會議委員會、該委員會將城印度進行其工作、並與英政府作極密切之接洽、所有財政等問題、以及印人參政制度、皆將由此委員會處理之、此次大會、雖未實現會衆之全部願望、但較諸大會一年前之地位、已大有進步矣、現雖未得完全解决方法、但英政府願不斷的努力工作、務使彼此經營、獲有成功之結局云云、英相言畢、全塲肅然、最後英相起稱、渠宣告大會現已閉幕、於是英相趨甘地之前、與之握手、兩人對視、略談數語、其音甚低、究不知作何語也、英相後與各代表一一握别、會衆遂陸績退出、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯一日倫敦電　本日下午甘地在英國某　　　棧之客廳中、招待報界代表、圍爐廣　而坐、貎似勞頓、發音低微、幾不可辨、言時且多停頓、其大意謂伊所憂慮者、不在圓桌會議之所爲、而爲此時印度發生之事變、緣印度情形、尤其爲孟加爾情形、至爲可懼、依此情形、則圓桌會議不見有何盛大結果可以希望、甘氏所謂孟加爾事變、係指最近公布之命令而言、此項命令以特别權力畀予政府、俾其鎭壓所謂恐怖主義、甘氏以爲按渠個人之經騐、每値一歐人被害、政府即張惶失措、已成習慣、甘地謂擾亂行爲、渠所深恨、然政府所取之鎭壓手段、亦足使人駭異、若印度人所要求之完全自由、一日不能畀予、則恐怖主義即一日不能斷絕根株、印度人民對於暴力深爲厭惡、故甘地仍抱不抵抗主義、繼續努力、不問政府之能否覺悟也、甘地擬於星其六午前離倫敦、是日下午六時可抵日内瓦附近之新城、而下榻於著作家荷曼荷郎家中、再由該處啓程經羅馬、前赴白蘭地西港買舟回印、</p>
<p>國民社一日倫敦電　印度圓桌會議、未能達到草擬一全印獨立聯邦憲法之目的、其原因全在於各代表或英政府之未能解决少數民族保障問題、此外複雜問題如外交財政·及印兵之管理權等、雖在會議後半期加以討論、但當甘地未能設法解决少數民族問題時、會議已有難逃失敗之勢、此後雖繼續開會、徒屬拖延時日而已、蓋正式會議旣不獲成議、則少數民族與印度敎徒代表間之私人談話、收效自微、按少數民族問題、實係互相關連之數十問題聯結而成、即如印度敎徒雖在英領户口中占絕大多數、但在本迦白·孟加爾·與西北邊境及新特各省、亦屬少數民族、回敎徒在英屬印度共七千萬、實爲最複雜之少數民族問題、此外則有被壓迫階級與錫克族巴斯族耶族耶敎徒與印英混合種及歐洲利益等、均係較大問題、回敎徒在西北邊省與新特省境内佔絕大多數、在本迦白省佔全省居民百分之五十六、在孟加爾亦有百分之五十四、其他各省則祇屬少數、但回敎在此等省内、居省立法會議之重心、已達二十年、所以在此次會議中、仍堅持保障在本迦白省與孟加爾省之多數代表權利、質言之、則在省立法會代表中常占百分之五十一、錫克族集中於本迦白省内、當英國歸併時、錫克族方爲該省之統治者、故此次與印度敎徒聯合力爭、若保證回敎徒在該省立法議會内享有多數權、并非公允辦法、以爲議會重心應握之該族、猶之回敎徒居少數之省份内、回敎徒仍握立法會議之重心、又印度敎徒亦竭力反對保障回敎徒在孟加爾省之多數權、以爲他日印度敎徒或有機會成爲多數民族、又被壓迫階級、全印度不下五六千萬但散居各省悉屬少數民族、故爲極複雜之問題、惟目下談判、專注在本迦白省問題、身當談判之衝者現認印回間問題、　有圓滿辦法、則其他少數民族不難自行解决、</p>

<p>樂華力抗西捕</p>
<p>二與五之比失敗</p>
<p>西捕昨日大失態</p>
<p>衛根生被罰出塲</p>
<p>屢戰屢北之樂華隊、昨日逢强勁之西捕足球隊、安得不敗哉、雖然樂華亦於下半時猛攻、破西捕之門二次、不亦難能乎、結果五比二、比賽爲甲組聯盟、觀者三四百人之數　裁判員蔣湘靑、</p>
<p>樂華上半時之猛鬥　西捕開始即攻、樂華亦出死力以抗、來去三十分鐘　西捕竟不得逞、至此才由衛根生在左攻入一球、紀錄方開、上半時終結、僅由衛根生再入一球、成二比○、</p>
<p>西捕陷落後之失態　下半時開球不五分鐘、</p>
<p>推納在中、突射進一球、成三比○　然而樂華處境雖烈、反攻無已、逼近西捕門前、顧尙動在邊猛射一球、愛墨士兩手捧得　而　鋒擁至、愛向後一退、蔣湘靑遂宣告樂華勝利、愛墨士暗中移上二步、西捕遂表示不能折服、一般爲西捕捧場者亦羣起一吠百吠、</p>
<p>毅然罰衛根生出塲　此後西捕突變常態、凡蔣湘靑有不利於西捕之裁判、即上前結閶、推納再攻入樂華成四比一、樂華繼續進攻、江潮正中一脚、打中西捕、果然成四比二、而西捕之態度益劣、衛根生尤屬難堪、蔣不得已、毅然罰之出塲、喔克萊然右打成五比二、無聯而散、</p>

<h3>玳梁憶語</h3>
<p>— 燕子</p>
<p>遜淸光緒初年。日本明治刻意　新。鯨吞琉球。處視朝鮮。早已視淸廷爲病夫。而西太　　遊自娛。將海軍經費。移修願和圍。雖經李鴻章等力爭無效。論者早已知中日不免一戰。迨朝鮮東林黨起事。淸廷命李鴻章派兵往援。其時袁世凱駐節朝鮮。少年氣盛。不善措置。葉志超奉命帶聶士成左寶貴衛汝貴進兵漢城。各不統率。致一敗於仁川。再敗於平壤。左寶貴竟以身殉。時論榮之。李明知兵不能用。意欲退扼鴨綠江。固守遼東。不問朝鮮政變。何如新進之士如張季　袁項城等。侈談政事。集矢於李。乃自吳大澂大營潰散。湘軍二萬人。肉薄戰殁後。大局幾不可問。幸宋慶扼守蓋平。馬玉崑等摩天嶺。興依克唐阿之八旗兵。成犄角之勢。日軍屢勝之下。趾高氣揚。深入重地。被宋馬依之截擊而俘獲者達千餘人。其時聶士成一軍。亦以善戰者。獨惜統率無人。不能大張撻伐。否則跳梁之倭寇。恐未能如此之猖獗也。</p>
<p>不除庭艸齋夫談薈</p>
<h3>戰神前之對話（四）</h3>
<p>「這話也對！我還有一點顧慮，猶欵不决。我們戰而敗，敗而亡，兩眼一閉，什麽痛苦也不知道了。可是小孩們身受亡國之痛，您可爲他們打算了没有？我們不能把祖宗遺下來的江山弄得更好些交給後代，却把它亡掉，使子孫們世世代代受人宰割，我捫心自問，有些不安。」</p>
<p>「您心裏不安，我心裏又能安嗎？可是我們應當交給後人最寳貴的遺産不在金銀財寳而在威武不屈的精神。如果我們甘心情願做不戰而亡的亡國奴，那末，兒子學爸爸，孫又學兒子，世世代代學做奴隷，永遠不能翻身。倘使我們屢敗屢戰，屢戰而還不免於亡，則這威武不屈之浩然正氣，上冲雲霄，橫被四海，下傳萬年而無窮盡，到了積之旣厚必定是如同尼亞嘠拉大瀑布奔流到海而不可抵禦。那時自然會醞釀成一個總翻身··中華民族翻身，臺灣民族翻身，朝鮮民族翻身，軍閥財閥兩所斧頭宰制下之日本民族翻身，世界一切被壓迫的民族都翻身！」</p>
<p>「這樣看來，我也主戰！我要站在公理人道的戰線上與日本軍閥肉搏。利害，禍福，成敗，存亡都不能搖動我這主戰的信念。」</p>
<p>「您旣確立了爲公理人道、戰之堅决信念，我願意給您一些安慰。不爲利害，禍福，成敗，存亡所搖動然後才可以談利害，禍福、成敗，存亡。依我的看法，宣起戰來中國不一定敗，不一定亡。您不必太悲觀。」</p>
<h3>甲午戰役中之劉含芳</h3>
<p>— 朱瘦狂</p>
<p>大東溝一役。爲中日海軍最激烈之一戰。鄧世昌撞艦身殉。丁汝昌退守北洋海軍根據地之劉公島。命魚雷隊佈港口爲防。魚雷統帶蔡廷幹。乃留美學生。亦新人物也。威海衛有砲台二。南北對峙。俗稱南北幫。守者戴宗蹇。彼時諸將設能誓死禦敵。堅守門户。一心一德以赴之何致一蹶不振。詎意敵艦甫至。蔡廷幹率魚雷先遁。砲台相繼陷　丁汝昌自死。北洋艦隊盡歸倭有。東海關道兼北洋水陸營務處劉含芳。索蔡廷幹甚急。蔡託庇烟台外人得免。按劉含芳號薌林。皖人。爲北洋大臣李鴻章所識拔。有劉瞎子稱。烟台人士有不滿劉氏者。曾作詩譏。喧傳一時。句云。東海監司瞎子當。（第二句已忘）最奇綽號劉叭狗。換尾稱兒拜北洋。可謂笑駡備至。然劉氏尙能盡守士之責。不畏死。不屈節。聞敵軍逼烟台。知大事已去。歎曰。事已至斯。余惟以一死報國耳。言畢。夫婦均公服登大堂。坐待日寇之至。誓死不屈。旋經各國領事出阻日軍。乃未登陸。劉氏當時雖未身殉。然其志其行。誠足媿夫今世之所謂守士疆吏。苟安求生臨難畏死者。</p>
<h3>烽火津門中之雁足</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>余戚一尤室主人。爲津門寓公者有年。此次倭人肆暴。烽火連天　翹首燕雲。懷憂故舊。曾一再飛函詢之。茲得其覆。略知近狀。中心爲之釋然。今將覆札。錄之於下。諒亦關心津門狀况者之所樂聞歟。（上略）此間於八日夜突生劇變。形勢嚴重異常　河西一帶。（各租界均在河東河西）受驚不小。人民死於非命者甚夥。圍困戰綫中。絕食至三四日者。亦復不少。幸得紅十字。紅卍字各會出發救濟。連日救出婦孺。設法安頓。河北爲各機關集中地。故防禦異常周密。尙舞不幸事發生。日來形勢稍弛。然日租界仍增兵築壘。加緊工作。不知其意何居。前途黑暗。仍隨時可變也。此次事出倉卒。人民均未預備。故河北各地。不及遷徙。日租界居民　爲倭人逐出。大都移法租界。因日租界與法租界毘連也。至各旅館　均利市十倍。某暫守鎭靜。好得有市政府戒嚴通行證。故來去尙可自由。擬俟緊急時。再設法移出。然祇能借住友人家矣。旅館飯店無揷足地。租界居民凡有一小屋可騰出者皆賃善價。吾儕何不幸於此内亂外侮之世。鼙鼓驚人。苟全性命。亦殊不易。尙何言哉。尙何言哉。此函到時。不知津沽又成何景象也。（下略）倭人以侵略爲目的。以櫌亂爲計畫。我國人若不亟起對付。恐殃禍全國。近在眉睫之間。錄主人札。爲之慨爲。</p>
<h3>舜水先生全集版本考</h3>
<p>— 朱補鈞</p>
<p>前見自由談載同學王君介人文。稱日本近二百年文化之物勃興。實賴我明季大儒朱舜水先生敎化之力。并以先生空懷復明之志。未遂報國之願。卒致憔悴異邦。楚材晉用。深致慨歎。茲按先生與王陽明黃梨洲二先生。世稱我姚三大學者。流　遺業。沾慨無窮。似宜人傳其學。家有其書。然陽明南雷。固已聲光炯然。瓣香供奉。獨先生之書。傳布未廣。知者殊希。絕學繼述。責在後輩。典型未遠。嚮往彌深。昔年嘗見梁任公有舜水年譜之作。載北平實學雜誌。惜以未窺全稿爲憾。今將關於舜水公遺書版本。近今所稱述者。分錄如左。倘亦景仰先生者所樂聞歟　　（一）朱徵君集。（門人川源剛伯編。加賀侯校補。）（二）舜水先生文集二十八卷。（門人水户侯源光圀編。日本正德五年刻於西京。）（三）舜水全集。（稻葉岩將加賀水户二本參校合刋。又取張廷枚姚江詩存所錄泊舟稿附之。）（四）舜水遺書。（計文集二十五卷。雜箸四卷。山陰湯壽潛蟄先將稻葉本删定。其壻馬一浮爲之序。民國元年出版。近日坊間尙可購得。每部價約四五元。惜此書因當時印書人急於謀利　不及細校。致内容誤字誤句。不勝爬梳。正待詳加勘正耳。）（移酬助賑）</p>

<p>天意亦何慘。斯人得此災。凌空焚玉痛。墮地絕絃哀。鱗爪窺新月。風塵奠舊醅。（君輯新月雜誌又有巴黎鱗爪集）聽歌燕市别。疾首不堪回。君南歸前在北平與余同園聽曲一夕言别遂不復見）</p>
<h3>附紀念志摩之倡議</h3>
<p>楊杏佛致戈公振函云。志摩慘死。使人感覺浮生如夢。年來友人之慘死者。如明復之泅水溺死。腴廬之中彈。志摩之飛行遇禍。竟愈出愈奇。亂世人命。本如草芥。天固不應獨厚於我輩。然亦不應薄之至此也。報載上海友人。已設治喪處。不知計劃如何。弟意不宜倣偉人之舖張。宜注意於永久及有意義的紀念。如墓應擇風景佳處。爲堅固美雅之建築。設新詩奬金或印刷費。爲永久之紀念類。錢不在多。但求用之得當。尤當使有詩意。湘眉謂志摩一生。乃一絕好新詩爲其最佳之創造。治喪似不可忘却此點也。</p>
<h3>陳玄嬰先生六十壽序</h3>
<p>— 黃季剛</p>
<p>四明文章之士。立言粲盛者。自任中丞後。於宋則攻媿。元則剡源淸容。全謝山所稱吾鄮文雄是也。易世而起。謝山以湛園當之。後二百餘年而至玄嬰先生。又湛園之縣人也。近代古文正宗咸曰桐城。祖述其法者盈天下。率用揣摩音嚮塡塞匡廓爲事。而限其封畛。極於八家與歸方。外此者雖成名。亦爲别派。隘矣。非之者未始乏人。唯先生之言鐫切最甚。斥其人爲下究比之於子孫奴隸之行。以順爲正。嘗言文必法上。而又不嫌于創。創而適于時。法之所由成出。順不適乎時。法之所由敝也。得先生之說。不獨可以救桐城末流之失。即近頃薄古血逞□者。亦不至漬决衝陷而無所止。則信乎先生爲今日談文者之司南。宜其克紹西溟而殆欲過之者也。數年前。侃始得讀先生所撰定海縣志。觀其編制條例。迴異於向來郡書地里書之爲。劉子玄所云置於他方罕聞愛異者。至先生此書而不然。蓋昔之方志。畸於考古。而此志則重於合今。昔之方志。質者則類似簿書。文者又模襲史傳。此志詳臚表譜。位置有方。綜叙事實。不華不俚。昔之方志。無過傳述鄕閭之舊聞。此忐則推明民生之利害。使域中千餘縣。皆放此而爲之。不特一革鄕國史之體製。實即吾華國民史之長編。後之人欲知源流淸濁風澤芳臭。不於是取。將焉取之。此其踰章惲越常劉耦馬班而遺九共之遺誥舉行人之墜典者矣。今年春。先生從弟訓慈。以天嬰室叢稿示侃。復得讀文適及與余巖書諸竊。證之先生所爲方志。乃知先生所云法上而不嫌於創者。其力實能赴之。故自言能籀禹貢職方之微。而洗朝邑武功之陋。世皆知非夸語也。夫文史分塗久矣。文士撰箸一二短篇。不成條貫統紀。史家闇於體例。或辭律蕪陋。難副記載之職。如先生之兼有其能。豈非當今所至難覯者哉。方志之書。或尊之儕於史。或夷之於小說。由今觀之。儕之史者則善矣。昔者朱贛所采。浹於九州。鬭駟所脩。殫於四國。其時若無可因之典籍。則朱闝之美亦必不成。是知鄕史者。國史之分。而一方之史。即全國之史之基也。私慨建國以來。内憂外患。迄無寗息。故撰述之事。以擾攘而未遑。淸史稿初出時。偶獲流覽。頗病其局守舊規而不知變。於淸室非信史。於新國爲謗書。誠欲考知此二百餘年之事蹟。將茫乎無所依準。國家果思垂不刋之文於後。自非徵集備三長者以從事。則必無以易前之失。如先生者。能爲鄕史示準繩。即能爲國史成型範。此則在位者所未宜忽忘者也。十二月八日。爲先生六十生辰。門人鄞童第德先期告侃曰。子於玄嬰先生悅服夙矣。曷不因此時而有言。旣以貼子之所懷。亦以爲先生娛。侃不敏。常以文史誨後生。於桐城之文。有所未學。而無所非。獨時時稱說先生所謂法上而不嫌於創者。雖不能至。心嚮往之。爰從童子之言。輒爲此文。以當謂見之摰。若夫舖叙生平。妄作諛頌。則先生集中屢有厭鄙之辭。侃不敢以進也。中華民國二十年九月。蘄春黃侃鞠躬謹譔。</p>

<h3>鄕下人又到上海（三十五）</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>這時鄕下人站在人家的階台上，許多人圍繞着他。他好像是一個黨國偉人，指導羣衆，羣衆都聽他的命令一般。聽得鄕下人說··反對馬占山的，應該打倒，大家一時齊呼道：　　「打倒！打倒！打倒反對馬占山將軍的冷血動物！」</p>
<p>大家喊着口號眞個要打進去了。幸虧裏面有一個老年的人，出來擋住。「慢來！慢來！你們爲什麽事？此地並不出賣日貨呀。」</p>
<p>「可惡！你們爲什麽反對馬占山將軍？」羣衆洶洶然的說。</p>
<p>「我們並没有反對馬占山呀。」那個老年人說。</p>
<p>「還說没有反對？你們的電光燈上，不是明明寫着「反占」兩個字嗎？」</p>
<p>「哈合！誤會了！誤會了！這裏本來是一家大旅館。上海的大旅館，現在一概稱之爲飯店。此地房子已經造好了，究竟呌什麽飯店，還没有定。前天那個電光燈廣告公司來兜生意，我們說：我們什麽飯店還没有定，怎麽可以做電光招牌呢？他們說：開飯店總是定局的了。我們先做飯店兩字，隨後再加上什麽名稱。我們應許他了。誰知過了幾天，飯店的飯字，一個食字旁不亮了，變成一個反字：店字的一點一劃一撇也不亮了，只賸一個占字：我們實在並非有意反對馬占山將軍的，要請諸位原諒。」</p>
<p>大家一聽，倒也不差，的確是誤會了。但是鄕下人，也是出於一種好心，旣然他們不是有心反對馬占山，也就罷了。</p>
<p>閙了這時候，辰光也不早了，他急欲去到梅蘭坊，尋他的外甥阿木林。也是他運氣，雇到了這輛黃包車，却是認得法租界梅蘭坊的，便把他一直拉到梅蘭坊，見了他的外甥阿木林。</p>
<p>「娘舅！我正擔心你，爲什麽夜深了，還不來？」</p>
<p>「咦！你怎麽知道我到上海來？」</p>
<p>「鄕下轉到了上海一封快信在此，你看吧。」</p>
<p>鄕下人一看，是上海申報自由談編輯部寄來的，上寫道：「鄕下人又到上海。請早日結束。因年内爲日無多，而敝部特約之另一小說·亦限於年内刋完，不得不先行通知也。」</p>
<p>鄕下人很爽快，說道：「好！旣然如此，我就立刻滾蛋·回鄕下去。」（完）</p>

<h3>證劵</h3>
<p>公債市非常沉靜</p>
<p>限制後成交大减</p>
<p>昨（二日）華商證劵交易所各債市况、現貨進出活潑、計上午成交二萬九千元、下午亦有一萬五千元、合計四萬四千元、期市較淸、全日買寶始終非常沉靜、計上午開出二百念七萬　後市祗七十餘萬元　合僅二百九十八萬五千元、蓋各債劵多僅有數十萬交易也、至言各債券價之變動情形、晨初一盤、市場人心仍佳、賣方以受有限制、不能自由賣出、買方在市上仍佔優勢、零星收進、依然暢旺、價均續漲頗鉅、如二○關曾漲達二元、其他亦各漲一元左右、次盤則以買進略稀、價復回疲、嗣後趨勢盤旋、無大漲落、結果期貨如二○關捲約漲一元、餘好半元左右、裁兵九六不動現貨二○關統稅亦漲頗鉅、裁兵則比上週漲達八元、獨緼遺二○捲現貨略疲、觀債市形勢、雖目下外交情况、殊少轉機、惟以到期還本付息之各債劵、現均如期履行、人心安定、各方情况、尙屬樂觀、又連日以交易所方面限止新賣出、成交大减　投資者多感不便、現債價轉堅、不久或可望廢除限制云、</p>

<h3>紗花</h3>
<p>紗市趨高</p>
<p>紗市甚堅、且漲風頗熾、因以前看時局不佳之散户、抛出甚巨、多數被廠商吸收、現以消息稍佳　反動驟起　於是散户購買之力、愈趨愈强　然實需依然平澹、總之底貨不旺　容易上漲云、</p>
<p>人標漲二三兩　人標前市開盤、以美棉雖跌、場中買户甚多、致市氣頗緊、各月漲一兩八九錢至二兩五錢、午後近月仍堅、又漲七·八錢　遠跌一二錢、全日成交統計四萬八千四百包、查賣出泰興四千八百五十包、明德一千四百五十包、賡豐一千○五十包、元泰一千○五十包、買進恒德一千三百五十包、信誠一千○五十包、恊生九百包茲將收盤價列左、</p>

<h3>棉市新多蜂起</h3>
<p>棉市漲風劇烈、以金價大漲、而印棉趨漲、致散空恐慌、場中賣户缺乏、目新多者日多、漲風愈趨愈緊、但實需依然岑寂　各廠均無活動、照實際上、仍屬平澹、大槪抛空者太多、反動尤烈、</p>

<h3>美棉重趨疲態之由來</h3>
<p>買户不多···華爾街抛賣</p>
<p>昨美棉初因缺乏重要買户、及華爾街抛賣而疲、後因一部份補空略回　計期貨跌七至十二磅音　現貨跌十磅音、英棉期貨跌一點、現貨漲二十三點、埃及棉現貨漲三十點、印棉市况堅定、計平果爾及白羅溪漲七·五羅比、奥姆辣漲十羅比、原電錄左、（一日電）</p>

<h3>糧食</h3>
<p>米市跌而復硬</p>
<p>南頭　昨日來源二十餘號、城鄕店胃因天時不佳、交易比前市爲旺、聞閘市先提、均抱扳售之態、厚新粳行情頓提二角、　稻客帮辦去近千石、大盤喊起二三角、蘆洋尖到稀銷淡、市呈穩態、西新及早稻存厚、形勢坐定、</p>
<p>新閘　到船不多、市形爽暢、西新買户尤多、高貨及普通各增一二角、早晚稻來貨有限、本街與鄕莊帮略有辦動、故趨勢升高近角、變陰二元、雖呈堅穩、然有向上之勢、杜洋尖到乏、昂起角半、</p>
<h3>洋米因金貴跟漲二三分</h3>
<p>昨日洋米市况、略形活動、但祇有本街問訊、各客帮仍未注意也　統市開出一號西貢五百包、價十一元二角八分、小絞一千包、價十元○一角五六分、期貨新交易有禪臣抛出二月份裝船小絞二千噸價四兩七錢三分、又回籠貨有四月份小絞六百噸、價四兩九錢四分至四兩九錢二分半、又五月份一百噸價五兩　統由本街進出、期現各米本居平勢、昨因金價激漲、產價划高、人心乃　、貨主心思轉堅、各米售價見漲二三分、</p>
<h3>粉市復軟</h3>
<p>洋麥雖好···未能帶起</p>
<p>昨日粉市大致呈平疲之象、當上午開價時、因洋麥報價　仍好四五角左右、市氣雖見穩俏、惟以後各盤　終因時局不寗、北方局勢、又不能渡此難關　日軍此撤彼增　實可大慮、所以人心復軟、本月份即逐小二分之譜、遼期尙覺站住、迫至下午開盤、前三盤市氣依然平疲、惟後以客帮略活、似見略佳、但遠期因差度太高、人心反平、結果本月份較前日小五厘、一月份小二厘半二月份小五厘、三月份小七厘半、四月份小一分半、五月份小二分二厘半云、</p>
<h3>麥市難期過好</h3>
<p>盤旋而已</p>
<p>昨日期麥市面大致呈盤旋之態、以洋麥報價又回漲四五角之譜、大部份人心未免轉定、但時局不佳　麥之立脚點、難免帶動、致市氣甚平、難期過好、下午收價雖見略佳、惟買氣甚寂　恐難久擯、傳祥茂又有澳麥一船抛與廠家、價祗三兩九錢九分、照洋麥之繼定不已、市氣猶不容樂觀也、結果本月份至二月份均無出人、三月份好一分、四月份好二分云、</p>
<h3>糖市</h3>
<p>糖市漲風未已</p>
<p>本古糖存缺更俏</p>
<p>昨日糖市產區電訊、古巴現糖價爲一·一八七五、比前電續跌九三七五　紐約期糖十二月份價一·一二、比升二分、明年三月份一·一○、不動、五月份一·一五、比跌三分、九月份一·二七、亦跌一分、爪哇現期糖仍少升沉　惟據廠方報漲半盾、本埠公會市場劃盤以外匯迭縮、荷市告漲、人氣更盛、需要益見活躍、交易頗湧、荷糖二十四號組砂白成交價自十兩○三錢至三錢半、十六號中砂白九兩八錢、二十號貨十兩○○五分、趨勢甚俏、太古糖漲勢更銳、Ｂ嘜十一兩一錢至九錢、後市喊十二兩、ＤＹ嘜十一兩八錢至二分半、ＨＸ嘜十一兩七錢至七錢半、ＨＭ嘜十一兩五錢至五錢半、出户仍缺、實以市存殊薄、十二月份貨未有售出　統計棧存僅有二萬餘包、故市頗俏俐、</p>
<h3>南北貨</h3>
<p>碼圓肉開九十五兩</p>
<p>石碼生晒桂元肉、今庚因貨少價昂、皆由各行自辦爲多、前日太古公司淸南輪由厦入口、到有數箱、昨已見樣、貨品尙屬乾赤、當即開出、價爲九十五兩、本届新貨、號家猶係首盤云、</p>
<h3>絲茶</h3>
<p>雙宫廠絲輸出不弱</p>
<p>上月中裝往歐美各國二百八十餘件</p>
<p>歐美各國近因經濟恐慌、絲織品銷路疲滯、各綢廠力主减輕成本、對於我國新式雙宫廠絲售價與緝里經相頡頑、需要尙暢、上月中滬關出口數量、尙稱不弱、一月中裝往歡美各國共達二百八十七件云、</p>
<h3>廠經美銷仍無轉機</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊絲市、仍趨疲靜、緣紐約方面對於中身Ｂ級滬白廠經雖有需要、而電轉價仍祇八百三四十兩、廠方本重、仍難抛售、昨祇怡和進揚返黃廠經二十包、泰和等進白乾經二十包、價仍平　云、</p>
<h3>屯溪珍眉續趨堅漲</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊茶市、屯溪高莊珍眉絲茶、英莊怡和恊和錦隆同孚等行、搜買仍不遺餘力、華茶商均以手中存貨不多、態　堅挺　行情較前又漲二三兩　惟婺源北路有色珍眉、夫路依然呆滯、日來英莊行家、雖有電報發出、但極少回音、其餘貢熙秀眉等項、亦均無人問及云、</p>
<h3>疋頭</h3>
<p>呢絨厦門帮活動採辦</p>
<p>昨日呢絨市面、仍未見有特殊變化、零星交易尙覺繁盛、英美德法各洋行定貨生意、亦甚活動、但大半因先令放長、改做金洋、厦門帮邇來呢綁進胃活動、麥爾登·馬褲呢、全毛高等大衣呢及間特呢等、續有需要、而對於鼻烟華特呢、辦胃尤濃、昨由某掮客轉手、成交寗豐牌子毛駝二三箱、每碼價爲三兩六錢半、比元常藍灰便宜二三錢云、</p>
<h3>五金</h3>
<p>馬口鐵出路暢達</p>
<p>馬口鐵市面因存貸充塞、走銷疲滯、其詳情早誌本報、惟新近數日出路驟見暢達、如客帮廠家點綴甚廣、而囤户帮復見其底盤便宜、亦下手收羅、是以在砦萎靡不振之市場中、出路甚爲活潑　總計成交達四五百箱、而期貨成交竟有一千餘箱、因此市貨被搜見缺、標準扶搖　上、計九十磅英貨每箱可售至十二兩光景、一百磅十四兩五錢、美貨九十磅十四兩五錢、一百磅十五兩七錢半、二百磅貨二十七兩五錢、聞現下市存　薄、故人心良佳、苟銀根一鬆、前途定有再漲之勢云、</p>
<h3>煤炭</h3>
<p>山西煤貨缺價漲</p>
<p>山西白煤、近來到貨稀少、棧存現貨奇缺、銷路因天時漸寒、用途日廣、故市上需煤頗殷、惜乎乏貨應市、凡欲有三四十噸之買進者、輒不能得、盤價因而暗漲、昨日市塲售開、每噸有呌至二三十兩者、但正盤則仍爲十九兩二錢半云、</p>
<h3>雜訊</h3>
<p>湖絲三百零五件、運往英法、</p>
<p>茶葉一千六十箱、裝至西班牙、</p>
<p>礦砂二十五噸、運赴倫敦、</p>

<p>日本商業已降至第五位</p>
<p>自瀋案發生、暴日强佔東北、全國人民、一致厲行抵制仇貨以來、滬市日商、莫不大起恐慌、紛紛停裝貨物來華、日本整個在華市塲、亦由第一位而降爲第五位、歐美各國、藉此機會、對於在華商務之競爭、莫不處心積慮、思攫日本在華地位而自代、昨據本埠海關確息、歐美各國運華貨物總額、近兩月來、超出以前輸入、月達數百萬元、至於國貨方面、因旅外僑胞之盡力提倡、及國内同胞之樂於購用、銷路激增、報關裝運出口者、日見踴躍、截至昨日止、據海關精確之統計、較之在未抵制日貨前、已增收二百餘萬元、此項增收關稅、國貨方面、實佔全數十分之七八、日貨則雖尙未完全肅淸、但其衰落之現象、實開自有抵制仇貨以來之新紀錄、海關人員云、若我全國人民、能再堅操抵制本個月、則我國所存日貨、必可完全絕跡、即彼邦在華商業、亦將永久陷於不振之地位矣云云、（新聲社）</p>

<h3>日輪</h3>
<p>瑞陽丸擱斷</p>
<p>船體裂破····拖救無望</p>
<p>日淸公司之航業、現方辦理收束、而留行之長江輪瑞陽丸、上月在南通以上擱淺、該社百計設法、先後派輪六七艘、駛往拖救、詎料船底爲沙泥吸住、以拖曳過猛、瑞陽輪竟至折斷、船員載來上海、輪社損失至大、亟將此事查記如下、</p>
<p>擱淺原因　瑞陽輪由上月十一日赴漢、行至南通以上六十浬、地名和尙沙、即遭擱淺、其失事原因、爲船主係由海輪巴陵丸輪所調任者　第一次上船即肇巨禍、蓋航路不盡熟知之故也、自擱淺以後、江水日退、輪底爲沙泥吸牢、無法出淺、滬社得報、即派小火輪多艘、駛往拖救、經過多次、俱告失敗、</p>
<p>卸貨駁客　船上貨物及上海赴漢之旅客、統由該社派襄陽丸輪往和尙沙代爲駁載、先行送往漢口、一面則派小火輪多艘、在瑞陽丸畔守候漲潮時拖救、擬一舉成功、詎料上次大潮汛時、瑞陽之機器、又告損壞、機會一過、無法再救、而瑞陽之船身　逐漸下陷、至不能移動、</p>
<p>輪身拖斷　上星期江水略漲、該社急派空停在滬之信陽丸輪帶同鋼絲繩索、趕到和尙、沙、套住瑞陽船首、由信陽丸及其他之小輪六七艘、開足火力、將瑞陽拖曳、用力過猛、而瑞陽深陷沙泥、力拖結果　非特未能出淺、反因曳力太大、將瑞陽丸之船知拖斷　其損斷處係在烟囱後之三尺、幸即停拖、否則早成兩叚矣、</p>
<p>職工來滬　瑞陽丸拖斷之後、曳救之希望已全絕、在輪之船員水手及茶房人等、均奉命離船、由小火輪載回上海暫行解散、船上略留船主生火等十餘人、現時擱淺之處、水退至不滿一二尺、甚且小火輪亦不能靠近、該輪已陷入絕境矣、</p>
<p>運木綁船　滬社接到瑞陽丸拖救不成、輪體裂斷之消息、急切派宜陽丸輪在滬運載大宗木頭、並修船工人技師等、一批由滬飛駛至和尙沙、决計先將該輪拖斷之處、暫用大批木料綁繫　勿使即行斷裂、然後再候明春江水盛漲時拖救、年内祇得聽其抛擱在沙、今次瑞陽丸輪擱沙折斷　損失至爲巨大、將來能否應用行駛、刻下尙不可知也、</p>

<h3>影戲素描·蘆·夢·殊</h3>
<p>Ccmmon　Law</p>
<p>百代（Pathe）公司的出品、在它過去的歷史上看來、似乎不很得到一般觀衆的信仰、原因它在美國並不是一爿頭等大公司、像派拉蒙、寰球、福克司、米曲羅、第一國家等、而出品也多是氣魄薄弱、無驚人的可能、故雖經它毅力支持、年年苦戰、終於莫可如何、縱然每年花很多的廣告費、也很少有人注意、但、自從它的名字的前頭加上了ＲＫＯ三個字母之後、就恰和以前的完全相反了、在它的努力和犧牲、便顯然地產生了不少良好的出品、因之、全年美國的Movie　Fans　們、在二小時黑暗中的享受之餘、在它的出品中便做夢也似地得到了奇妙的幻想、就每個人都深刻地對於RKO百代公司的出品有了很良好的印象、</p>
<p>誠然、這是藝術家們腦和血的結晶、科學和金錢的成就、所以、它的出品一到上海孔雀公司的片房裏就有好幾家頭等戲院爭着要拿去開映、</p>
<p>“Common　Law”便是它的出品到上海來的第一砲、現在新光開映華名呌做「洩露春光」的便就是這第一砲了、</p>
<p>「洩露春光」是由别具溫柔的女明星康士登絲本湼德主演的、劇本由RobertW.Chambers　的說部改編而來、寫愛情的偉大與純摯、很有力地打到人們的内心、同時又使人明暸於浪漫之所以浪漫、</p>
<p>它的背景是巴黎的拉丁區、就是描寫拉丁區的生活、拉丁區裏都是波希米亞人、藝術的奮鬭者、都是頂着一個强烈的靈魂而年靑富有血性者、劇中的主人翁魯意斯（男性）便是如上述的一個靑年、離開富麗舒服的家庭去享受他靑春期内的浪漫生活、並且、在拉丁區内一角小樓之中、拚命去研究畫、</p>
<p>然而畫、要有對象的、那便是模特兒、可是、一有了模特兒、在血的靑年　眼的觀察、心的燃燒、性的剌戟、就有如我的朋友穆羅茶兄所謂「溝」的男女日常生活的必然進展了、但是啊、作者要它有曲折、有波瀾、有趣味、有興奮、有剌戟、便刻畫爲工、故意地使它在平凡之中而不平凡起來、大弄其表現的藝術手腕、敎觀衆隨着情節的曲折緊張、做夢也似捉着了劇情而成功了自己奇妙的幻想、這麽一種魅力唯電影方能獨具、而這種魅力却是在「洩露春光」裏表現出來、微妙地、不可思議地攫着了每個觀衆的靈魂、在呌喊、</p>
<p>「洩露春光」所以好、固然如上述的一種魅力、但這魅力、並不是隨便甚麽影戲裏都有的、我看了西洋影戲不爲算少、然有魅力却不多睹、因爲、非得各方面的人材集中起來、共同合作、是不易產生的、即如「洩露春光」、我們固然知道它並不花多大的資本、可各方面人材的共同合作實然使人見到他們的精神的團結、著者是用全副精神寫成已是讀者所共曉的了、而其他如編劇者、導演者、主演者等、都是在修養與經騐上所得到的拿出心和血來共同合作的、你看原著是如何地優美、劇本是如何地縝密、導演是如何地緊凑、表演是如何地吻合個性、透澈深刻、就算科學上頭、佈景方面、也都給我們了然在事前是　經過一番考慮的、而男主演是一個個性堅定的少年、女主演是一個凄艶無雙的少女、却又把劇中的本事看作是自己的事實、毫無做作與勉强地離開了自己去表演劇中人、那末劇中人就活躍在銀幔之上了、並不是猶麥克拉與康士登絲本湼德、然而、他們丨猶麥克拉與康士登絲本湼德、在這一點上頭、就可以使我們看見他們平素的修養、</p>
<p>據好萊塢的消息、康士登絲本湼德已和史璜生（C.　Swanson）剛離婚的丈夫結婚了、牠是一個十六歲就嫁人十七歲就養了兒子現在還没廿歲的少婦、這當然與「洩露春光」無甚關係、但牠的Charms　就可以想見了、</p>
<p>「洩露春光」還有一層使人不能忘懷的、就是、康士登絲本湼德的溫柔别具、和牠的優美的綫條、笛條的身段、股膚以及足部美、</p>

<h3>三元五角</h3>
<p>— 獻魯</p>
<p>「魯、今天我們旅外學生會開會、是不是、」銘披着睡衣剛從洗面間走進寢室笑盈盈地說、</p>
<p>「怎不是、我也接到開會通告的、」我感覺討厭的答、</p>
<p>「那你去不去、」</p>
<p>「去嗎、我當然是要去、正好把我、</p>
<p>的職務交卸、」這時我更想起上届爲了編輯的事想盡了方法、才能把一本小册子出版出來、於是我心上委實有些不馬興去開這個會、</p>
<p>「去、去、我也去、」銘似乎窺察了我的不高興、鼓勵着我去、</p>
<p>飯後一點鐘、我和銘兩人趕上一路公共汽車到派克站下來、走進法學院新宿舍、我注目望了望九號房間、舉起手向門上敲了幾下、裏面許多聲音應着、丨丨Come　in！跟後我推了門進去、幾十位先我而到的同鄕一齊立起身同嚷着、「噢、來了、請坐、請坐······」</p>
<p>「對不信的很、呌你們好等了、」我含有歉意的說、</p>
<p>接下常務委員領導我們到一個敎室去開會、坐定下來、看看人數還不滿半百、銘驚奇問道、「怎樣、我們有一百多會員、難道祇到了四十人嗎、」</p>
<p>「哼、這還算好的哩、你有不知我們這班老爺們寗可到影戲院看電影、往常開會十多個人也竟會有的、」我忍不住的告訴他、</p>
<p>各部的工作已報告完了、差不多的提案已討論過哨於是開始選舉、不幸的很、我又被連選了本届編輯、常務當開票結果報告後、興盡了的衆人正預備着開步走、他提高嗓子喊道、「有没有臨時動議、趕快提出、」</p>
<p>「有、」我舉手應着、「本届出版計劃應該如何擬定、」</p>
<p>爲了我這樣一個動議、會塲的空氣又重新緊張起來、每一個人都交頭接耳的紛論着、各人所取的竟見不一、最後决定因本届改組過遲、暫出數十頁之季刋可矣、</p>
<p>「那末經費怎樣籌措呢、」我仍不得不追緊問、</p>
<p>衆人又爲了這一層有些欵難、默默不見動靜、忽然一位立起來說、「請會計報告本會經濟情形、」</p>
<p>「報告經濟情形嗎、現在除支尙存十三元六角三分、還有一筆賬未付、所餘有限了、」會計極泰然的報告着、</p>
<p>「那末總會有數百元的津貼未付、我們可不可以向欵産處付點來、」剛剛的那位又問、</p>
<p>「那絕對不可能的、分會决不可以支總會的錢、」常務駁斥他的動問、</p>
<p>「我主張向旅滬各同鄕募捐、」又是一位提出、「如陳軍長、程富翁······不都是我們靖江的同鄕嗎、大槪總肯出一點」</p>
<p>「吁······那也不行、」常務搖搖手連聲的說、「他們不都說過「拿錢買老子駡」嗎、其實我們平日的言論並没有詆及他們之處、不過你要他出錢終是很難、</p>
<p>這樣的討論下去、似乎已想到山窮水盡、以學生分利時代大家攤了吧、衆人又没有這樣的勇氣肯犧牲、在辦事人方面并且覺得如此一辦、恐怕下次規避不到會的人格外多了、終於還是幾個委員倒霉、議决應需的欵項由全體委員分派借出、等到會中經濟充足時再還、你想這是那百年上會中經濟能以充足、</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>我開始向在塲各委員收取、可是有些說我今天不便、有些說請你代墊了吧、更有些今天又没到會、若待前往各校收集、車錢也不知要化費多少、我仔細把收到的一算、呵、天哪、僅僅乎三元五角、</p>
<p>晚風很尖利地吹到我臉上、當時坐在汽車中的我爲這三元五角如何出一本數十頁的季刋打一陣寒噤、</p>
<h3>娘子軍</h3>
<p>— 君良</p>
<p>無疑地、自從暴日侵佔東省事件發生以來、宫裏姑娘們經演講者的警告、衣飾方面樸素得多了、記得那天演講者是如此說的、</p>
<p>「······試反顧我們國内的大學生、窮奢極侈、尤其是女同學方面、幾於無襪不絲、無鞋不皮、衣服則紅紅綠綠、五花八門、令人目眩心迷、······」</p>
<p>當時演講者還手指某姑娘而說、</p>
<p>「在此國難聲中、你看我們的女同學、穿得何等花妙、」</p>
<p>於是某姑娘芳頰上阄然赤化了、</p>
<p>經這次的風波、姑娘們的衣飾就趨向於樸實方面、是她們的覺悟、是她們的怕人詬駡、是她們一時的愛國衝動、我們局外人不能下斷語、總之、現在她們是樸素了、</p>
<p>每天晨光熹微着、曉霧迷漫着宫們的時候、姑娘們也得隨着男同學操練、我們遙望這一隊灰色的娘子軍、我們總不相信那些布衣的女軍人、就是從前禁宫中千嬌百媚的姑娘們、</p>
<p>娘子軍的敎練是個男同學、他每天總是很熱心地喊口令、我們除了欽佩他爲抗日救國而努力外、自然不敢說他有别種的目的、</p>
<p>分組檢閱的那天、男同學的制服尙付闕如、隊伍裏中西裝俱全、軍服也有、而娘子軍竟一律穿着靑布的服裝、娘子軍的精神、使少爺兵不得不甘拜下風了、</p>
<p>總司令爲了助長檢閱的威風、特地騎着白馬、掌着指揮刀在全塲看察、娘子軍裏時時發出輕微的笑聲、</p>
<p>突然、塲中起了騷擾、接着是姑娘們的喧嘩聲、娘子軍裏發生了變故、少爺兵都纼頸張望、原來娘子軍裏一位姑娘、經不起烈日的曝晒而暈倒在塲地、即時看護隊便實行她們的工作丨丨搬帆布牀、取藥水、一陣忙亂慢慢地平靜下來、</p>
<p>「在溫和的秋日的陽光之下、姑娘竟經不起操練而發病、他日怎樣上前線去、嗚呼娘子軍、」是少爺兵裏的嘆息聲、</p>
<p>就這樣在溫和的秋日的陽光之下站了三小時、檢閱式在呼口號後閉了幕、少爺兵同娘子軍一哄而散、</p>
<p>娘子軍裏幾位愛美的姑娘、忙跑到宫裏把靑布服式來換了、雖則她們已覺悟到服裝必須樸素、但那靑布的制服、活像女茶房穿的、總不免使她們感得太不雅觀了罷、</p>

<p>胡仲持擇　開明會店出版</p>
<p>世界文學史話初譯稿曾在申報「藝術界」上陸續揭載過的、譯者胡先生在全書付印前曾修改過二次、現在這一部洋洋三十萬言的世界巨著在中國出版界中和我們相見了、我們是非常地歡喜、因爲我們研究文學的人多添了這一部完美的文學史、而同時更深佩譯者有這樣堅决的努力在翻譯界中做下這一個很大的工作、</p>

<h3>日本新滿蒙政策·周·樂·山</h3>
<p>山田武吉著　　　周佩嵐譯</p>
<p>兩月以來、暴日以武力積極侵掠我滿蒙、在此國難聲中、莫不作抗日之準備</p>
<p>而對於日本之新滿蒙政策之研究、已成讀書界之重心、</p>
<p>時到今日、臨時研究滿蒙問題的人如此之多、可見得平日對於滿蒙問題之漠不關心、但是「急起直追」乃是吾人補過之道、也是不可厚非的、</p>
<p>總之、滿蒙問題凡屬國民都應該研究、這是「天經地義」的責任、</p>
<p>我現在所介紹的「日本新滿蒙政策」、是研究日本對華政策的一本重要的書、</p>
<p>這本書的内容是如此丨</p>
<p>第一章論滿蒙之特殊地位與滿蒙政策、第二章論滿蒙開發之要件、如、滿鐵之拓殖事業、滿鐵會社及其使命、對外政策之積極化、吉會鐵路之敷設、大拓殖事業之提倡、高等游民之海外發民、</p>
<p>我們將這本書裏所說到的、證之今日目前之事業、眞是絲毫不爽、一切都早在日本人的預定計劃之中、現在不過是實行他的計劃罷了、</p>
<p>第三章以後、尤其令人觸目驚心、如滿蒙更新之根本的大策、著者山田武吉曾確切地說、「然我國促成滿蒙爲」名副其實之特殊地域將如何而可、則不能不一新其方法者也、自來我國合併滿蒙之方式不侫以爲不外下列四種、</p>
<p>一、　滿蒙合併爲日本之領土、</p>
<p>二、　滿蒙成爲日本之委任統治國、</p>
<p>三、　滿蒙爲淸朝之發祥地、摊立宣</p>
<p>統廢帝爲滿蒙之主權者、日本</p>
<p>則掌握其政治·財政·軍事·及</p>
<p>其他一切之實權、</p>
<p>四、　或在張作霖保境安民之下、挅</p>
<p>取特别手段、無論如何、須斷</p>
<p>乎措置者也、</p>
<p>同胞們、現在眼前日本侵倞我們的事實、完全都是他們預定之中的事、一、二、三、四項、無一項不在積極進行之中、</p>
<p>第四章論滿蒙政策與東北亞細亞政策、有這樣的一段話、「日本之向東北亞細亞發展、與蘇俄之向極東發展、因國情之關係、有不得不互爭雄長者、惟如今日之狀態一再放任之、則日俄之利害必發生衝突或不幸而日俄再見於戰塲、」爲避免戰塲計、我國實行滿蒙更新之大策時、對俄不得不講求妥協之道、······」</p>
<p>这段話、可以將最近國際形勢觀察之、日本一面向蘇俄妥協、一方面防備蘇俄、所以兩月以來、蘇俄並未有所發動、完全是中了日本的妥恊之計了、</p>
<p>從第五章「朝鮮第二之滿蒙」中、可以看出日本人眼中之滿蒙、早已屬於他、並非中國所有、他說、「······今日之俄國、因與帝國時代大異、中國亦與淸朝時代不同、但其勢力究無往年之强盛、如就中俄兩國結合之點、與關係東亞之治亂、及日本之盛衰之點而觀、現在之滿蒙、不啻「朝鮮第二」决非失當之言、可深信焉、······」</p>
<p>總之、這本書的譯者介紹這本書到中國來、確乎具了深長之用意、可惜乎國人對國事太漠不關心、尤其是遼遠的滿蒙、視爲「越人視秦人之肥瘦」、無足輕重、所以會弄到今日的田地、</p>
<p>如果國人稍微注意一點的話、何至於這本書從十六年銷到現在、還是再版本呢、</p>

<p>President to Issue Declaration Explaining Police Rights</p>
<p>Neutral Zone to be Maintained by Chinese Police</p>
<p>(Paris) The League of Nations Council Drafting Committee, this</p>
<p>afternoon, drafted a resolution. This evening at 6 PM, it was presented to a secret meeting of twelve countries' representatives. Neither the Chinese nor Japanese representatives were present. It is heard that the resolution stipulates the prompt withdrawal of Japanese troops to the South Manchurian Railway Zone and the dispatch of an investigating committee to investigate the matter. The twelve directors have already expressed their agreement. As for the Japanese demand for bandit suppression rights, it was not included in the agenda. However, the twelve directors have agreed that President Briand will issue a separate declaration explaining these police rights. The Council will now request agreement from China and Japan on the resolution before submitting it to a full public plenary session for voting. It is heard that the directors oppose including the clause on bandit suppression in the resolution because (1) this clause violates international conventions, (2) including it in the Council's resolution would set a bad precedent, and (3) South American countries strongly oppose it, declaring that they cannot agree to allow a country to enjoy the privilege of using force under the pretext of suppressing bandits. Ito, the Japanese legal advisor, stated to the Associated Press that the Japanese government would likely accept this resolution. The Japanese delegation has reported to the Japanese government and, while they believe the situation is quite favorable, they must wait for instructions from Tokyo to be certain. If the Japanese government accepts the Council's resolution, it will insist that the Japanese army's police rights must be clearly and perfectly explained. It is heard that the Council's plan to dispatch an investigating committee involves five members, including one representative from South America. Initially, the committee was planned to have three members, but Japan requested an increase to seven. The current compromise is to send five. Their terms of reference will also be explained in Briand's declaration. (1st day, Kokumin News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) The League of Nations Administrative Council was quite busy today, sorting out its Manchuria proposal, hoping to submit it to the Administrative Council's full public assembly on Saturday or Sunday to seek unanimous agreement. If it passes successfully, the Manchuria investigating committee can be appointed, and the League of Nations' work to resolve the dispute between China and Japan can be temporarily concluded. The Administrative Council's small committee is currently considering the speech that President Briand will need to deliver at the final meeting of the Administrative Council on Saturday or Sunday. It will likely describe the outline of the entire case and express the position taken by the League of Nations. It is heard that the speech is of a philosophical nature and makes generalized conclusions. The Japanese representative today has approved the draft prepared by the drafting committee, but has raised objections and submitted a counter-proposal to the drafting committee for consideration regarding the President's criticism of the proposal. It is heard that the counter-proposal is related to the policing of banditry in Manchuria. If this counter-proposal is passed, the Japanese representative will ask his government to accept this proposal and criticism. Today's Administrative Council meeting lasted until 7:35 PM. The main point of discussion was the duties of the Manchuria investigating team. The drafting committee decided to meet again at 11 AM tomorrow to consider the details of the President's declaration on the investigating team. The Administrative Council will meet again tomorrow evening at 6 PM. The wording of the preamble to the proposal, which has now been passed, has been amended to facilitate future negotiations between China and Japan. The preamble explains the scope and relationship of certain clauses in the proposal, such as Manchurian policing and bandits. The Japanese representative disagrees with certain explanations, but it is generally believed that the counter-proposal submitted by the Japanese representative does not prejudice the remarks in the preamble. Dr. Shih's attitude is very moderate towards the draft, and it is expected that Nanjing will not have any difficulties. It is heard that the Administrative Council advocates appointing internationally renowned first-class figures as Manchuria investigating committee members. Before the case is formally submitted to the final meeting of the Administrative Council, Briand will explain its legal significance. (1st day, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Chinese representative today notified the Secretary-General of the League of Nations of the main points of China's response to Japan's requests regarding the Tianjin incident on November 27. The Chinese reply stated briefly that China had repeatedly stated that it was only implementing precautionary measures against plainclothes teams and was absolutely not hostile to Japan. It hoped that Japan would fully understand China's consistently friendly attitude and that both sides would cease actions that could lead to misunderstandings. Chinese troops have now withdrawn to twenty li from the city, and local police are responsible for maintaining public order. If the police were withdrawn as requested by Japan, the lives and property of Chinese and foreigners would be unprotected. Therefore, it is hoped that Japan understands this difficulty. However, if, through the joint efforts of local authorities of various friendly countries, an effective method for maintaining public order is determined, China is prepared to consider withdrawing. Chinese authorities have issued orders prohibiting anti-Japanese actions by the public. (1st day, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) The drafting committee met at 11 AM this morning to revise Briand's closing speech and to handle the issue of the Manchuria investigating committee. Several members of the Administrative Council requested to participate in the investigating committee, and Italy even made Italy's selection a necessary condition. It is heard that the Administrative Council has decided that the number of committee members should not exceed five. If the fourth person is Italian, the fifth person should be selected from a small country. The Paris Diary newspaper criticized this matter, saying that serious difficulties have arisen because Italy is determined to be an investigating committee member. First, because Italy openly advocates amending treaties, and second, if Italy requests to join, Germany may follow suit, and Germany advocates abolishing unequal treaties. The Italian representative, Serruys, has now announced that Italy has selected Dr. Cerruti, the ambassador to Brazil, as Italy's representative to participate in the investigating committee, because Dr. Cerruti is familiar with Chinese affairs. The newspaper also said that at yesterday's Administrative Council meeting, representatives from Spain and South America both expressed the view that the investigating committee should have seven or nine members. Therefore, the proposal for a five-member investigating committee has not yet been definitively decided. French newspapers predict that the Manchuria issue can be concluded this week. The Jinzhou issue is still disputed. The Japanese claim that many of the Chinese troops in Jinzhou are newly arrived. Although the Japanese troops have stopped advancing today and the vanguard has now withdrawn to Shenyang, the Chinese troops in Jinzhou have not withdrawn. The Japanese government believes that the non-withdrawal of Chinese troops will be seen as a victory by the Chinese. Today, Yoshizawa asked Briand to pay attention to the dangerous situation that would arise from China's failure to withdraw its troops to within the group, as originally agreed. Yoshizawa did not make any threats this time, but repeatedly stressed the necessity of a solution. (2nd day, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) The drafting committee reconvened this morning. Most of its work has been completed. Its current focus is on the details of the investigating committee. It has been confirmed that there will be a total of five members, one each from France, Britain, the United States, and Italy. The Italian member is the Italian ambassador to Brazil, Cerruti, who is well-versed in Chinese affairs, unlike his peers. As for the fifth member, the Netherlands has put forward a candidate. Various small countries have objections, saying that a Swiss, Belgian, or Swedish person should be appointed. The full text of the resolution was sent to the representatives of both countries concerned yesterday afternoon. Replies are expected to be received today or tomorrow. The final meeting may have to wait until Saturday or Sunday because Dr. Shi Zhaoji's statements in Paris differ somewhat from Gu Weijun's statements in Nanjing compared to what is seen here. The Executive Yuan, fearing future misinterpretations, wants to clearly point out the two issues of the investigating team and the neutral zone, so that there is no ambiguity, in order to achieve good results. (2nd day, Havas Agency Dispatch) (Paris) The New York Times, known for its reliable sources, published in Paris today that the resolution drafted by the League of Nations Council has six items: (1) Re-affirming the troop withdrawal provisions of the Council's resolution of September 30; (2) The parties concerned have a solemn obligation to prohibit any actions that could easily lead to loss of life; (3) China and Japan should report any developments in the three eastern provinces to the Council at any time; (4) China and Japan should provide the Council with any important information regarding the dispute; (5) Dispatch five investigating committee members and several experts; (6) Before the Council meets in January next year, ask Briand to closely monitor the development of the situation and convene a special meeting immediately when necessary. Also, the Paris newspaper Le Matin published this morning that the resolution has a preface that will solemnly state that this dispute has special circumstances and is an extraordinary case, and that the Council's resolution should not be regarded as a precedent for any future disputes. (2nd day, Kokumin News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) The drafting committee adjourned before 1 PM this afternoon, without deciding which country should join the investigating committee. It seems reasonable that a representative from a small country with no direct relationship with the Far East should join, as requested by members of the Administrative Council. This matter will be decided by the Administrative Council at its meeting tonight. The Jinzhou issue has become a key point again. The Administrative Council is eager to properly handle the issue of the neutral zone before closing, knowing that if there is no buffer between the two, there is a danger of disputes arising. (2nd day, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the issue of the neutral zone within the Administrative Council, the Chinese representative, fearing the advance of Japanese troops, requested a guarantee. This guarantee should be jointly undertaken by the United States, Britain, and France. The details are being discussed. The police duties in the neutral zone should be carried out by Chinese personnel and supervised by local civil officials. This level has already been confirmed. (1st day, Havas Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) British and French military observers reported on the situation in Jinzhou two days ago. This report has been sent to the League of Nations Secretariat. The French report stated that certain reports about the deployment of makeshift troops in Jinzhou and Qinhuangdao are completely unfounded. The British report stated that the situation in Jinzhou is normal, but that commerce has stagnated and tax revenue has decreased sharply. No disputes arose on the Chinese Eastern Railway due to the transportation of forty Japanese soldiers from Changchun to the Harbin consulate. The French also stated that the Japanese army commander had decided to withdraw all troops to within the South Manchurian Railway area, with two battalions stationed in Qiqihar and one battalion of Japanese troops each stationed across the Liao River from Jilin, Changchun, and Xinmin. The Chinese delegation sent a document to the League of Nations reporting several insignificant events, the most important of which was the appearance of 800 Japanese soldiers in Qinhuangdao and their digging trenches for defense. (2nd day, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Official Circles' Opinion on the Neutral Zone</h3>
<p>Absolutely Will Not Allow the Existence of the Jinzhou Provincial Government</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Observing the opinions expressed by the spokesperson of official circles today regarding the establishment of a neutral zone, it seems that new difficulties have arisen in the work of finding a solution to the Manchuria problem. The spokesperson of official circles said that it is insufficient for China to only withdraw its troops inside the Pass. Zhang Xueliang's Jinzhou government must also withdraw. The spokesperson further explained his meaning, saying that there are some aspects that clearly misunderstand the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' statement that Japan is prepared to leave civil administration in the neutral zone in the hands of the Chinese.</p>
<p>Japan is prepared to allow Zhang Xueliang's government to remain in Jinzhou, but only refers to the local civil administration of the towns and villages under the Jinzhou government. If Zhang Xueliang still maintains the government in Jinzhou, it will inevitably make the situation tense, because Zhang will use this as a base within Manchuria to direct bandit and anti-Japanese activities. Therefore, Japan proposes that the Shenyang Yuan Jinkai government should administer Jinzhou after the Jinzhou government withdraws. The Japanese representative has submitted a reservation regarding Briand's declaration on the issue of bandit suppression. The Administrative Council intends to amend the Japanese reservation, but Japanese official circles still regard it as very unsatisfactory. It is said that this amendment will require Japan to consult with the League of Nations at all times, even when there is a need for very minor actions. Furthermore, Tokyo considers the wording of the Administrative Council's proposal to be unnecessarily cumbersome. In the view of Japanese official circles, it can even be regarded as implicitly suggesting that the collapse of Chinese administration in Manchuria is due to Japanese actions. Therefore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has instructed Yoshizawa to insist on the original wording, as its meaning is more accurate and contains less ambiguity. The Japanese government has not yet heard whether the minor amendments submitted by Japan have been adopted. Therefore, Japanese official circles say that it is still difficult to say for sure whether Japan can accept the final draft, but it seems that there is still reason for optimism. (2nd day, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Responsible parties spoke this morning regarding reports from Paris about the draft proposal prepared by the drafting committee, saying that Japan cannot accept the League of Nations' Manchuria proposal if it does not grant Japan the right to suppress bandits. Tokyo has not yet confirmed official reports of newspaper reports, so it is generally believed that Briand's declaration on necessary policing plans may be a satisfactory substitute, as long as it clearly stipulates that the declaration has the same binding force as the proposal itself.

<h3>Russian Newspaper Reveals American Far East Policy</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The Russian newspaper Pravda published an editorial saying that the strategy adopted by American imperialism in the Manchuria dispute was formed under the pressure of American capital tycoons. Their intention is solely to provoke new wars to obtain new benefits. American strategy</p>
<p>has two objectives: one is to reduce Japan's influence in the Pacific, and the other is to strike a blow against Soviet Russia. It is known that this policy has brought the two imperialisms of Japan and the United States into conflict, as can be seen from Stimson's declaration. Dawes hopes that Japanese imperialism will clash with Soviet Russia in northern Manchuria and make relations between the two countries tense, so as to brew a major war. The United States will not directly participate in this war, but wants to use this war to restore its lost prosperity. The New York Stock Exchange was overjoyed to hear that war may break out, and some even took the opportunity to raise the market price of certain securities and wheat. Now the Manchuria issue has been settled in Paris, and with the United States involved, its content is to shift the center of gravity of Japanese military operations to northern Manchuria. The American bourgeoisie believed that Soviet Russia would inevitably fall into its provocative tricks, but unexpectedly this hope became a dream. Then the Japanese army turned south, so the American government said that its actions were self-defeating. Why say this? Because the interests of Japanese imperialism in central China directly conflict with the interests of American imperialism. The dispute between Tokyo and Washington is enough to reveal the secrets of the secret consultations of the imperialists in Paris. These people planned a conspiracy against Soviet Russia on the banks of the Seine River. The purpose of the imperialists is to provoke a war along the Pacific coast. The subsequent development of the Manchuria Incident has made the opinions of the imperialists increasingly divided. American imperialism has suffered a defeat, which Stimson cannot hide no matter what tricks he uses. Although the danger of war in the Far East cannot be considered to have been eliminated, American imperialists are almost openly acting as war instigators. This is very evident in recent events.

<h3>US State Department Pays Attention to Chinese Public Opinion</h3>
<p>Makes Statement Regarding Partiality to Japan</p>
<p>(Washington) People in the US State Department, seeing that Chinese public opinion reported that US policy was partial to Japan, declared today that the US government's policy has never advocated direct negotiations between China and Japan. Its declarations only stated that China and Japan should mutually decide on methods that are mutually agreeable to resolve the Far East dispute. Also, the United States does not oppose investigating committees or other methods deemed satisfactory by the two parties concerned. It is now believed that the United States will not formally be invited to join the investigating team, and will probably unofficially invite an American to serve on the committee.

Upon receiving this warning, Honjo had dispatched a part of the mixed brigade to Heihe to replace the 500 Japanese troops stationed there, because they were suffering from frostbite and were too tired to fight against strong enemies.

<h3>Tianjin Japanese Army Rotation</h3>
<p>Japanese Troops Re-enter Chinese Streets Yesterday to Search</p>
<p>Reservist Volunteer Corps Dissolved</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The defenses in the Chinese streets, except for the sandbags and barbed wire of the Public Security Bureau, Provincial Government, and Municipal Government, have all been removed, and the police are on duty without guns to show frankness. However, the defenses in the Japanese Concession have not only not been removed, but have been further heightened and thickened, and are using telescopes to scout the Chinese streets from the Zhongyuan Building. The Chinese are increasingly uneasy due to the arrival of large quantities of Japanese munitions and Japanese troops. The number of people moving out on the 2nd was even more crowded than before. The curfew is still from 7:30 AM to 4:30 PM. Shops open at 10 AM and close at 3 PM, with no business. The most prosperous Nanshi and the "Three No-Care Areas" in Tianjin are now mostly empty. Trams start at 8 AM and stop at 3 PM, and still cannot pass through the Japanese Concession. Formerly, daily ticket sales reached 3,000 yuan, but now they are only 600-700 yuan. The First District General Office has moved into the Public Security Bureau because South Diagonal Street is close to the Japanese Concession. (2nd day, Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) The Resident Group held a meeting at the public hall at 8 PM on the night of the 1st to welcome the Japanese troops who arrived in Tianjin, cheering wildly. At 8:30 PM, 40-50 Japanese marines, playing horns and drums, marched from the southeast corner of the city to the gate and entered the Japanese Concession to demonstrate to the Chinese area. The lights in the Japanese Concession were all turned on on the night of the 2nd. On the surface, things have eased, and the general public believed that the Japanese Concession would lift martial law on the 26th, but unexpectedly, after 10 PM, they suddenly fired artillery at the Chinese area. Today, everyone is uneasy about whether things are loosely guarded on the surface but tightly guarded in secret. (2nd day, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) At 2 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd, Chinese and foreign reporters went to the Municipal Hospital to慰问 the injured security team and people, and then went to Hebei for inspection. A shell landed on the Xinhe Tea House at No. 94 Xinhe Main Street, pierced through the eaves, passed through the two-story wall of No. 95, and even pierced through the roof of the flat house behind, and exploded on the ground. Fortunately, no one was injured. A shell landed on Gutou Main Street and Sheng Factory, pierced into the house.

Cannons have not been removed from Zhongyuan Company, the Imperial Palace Cinema, Mitsui &amp; Co., Ltd., and other places in the concession. Mitsui &amp; Co., Ltd. is also equipped with a radio station to communicate with Beiping, Qinhuangdao, Tanggu, Shenyang, Xinmin, Hankou, and Shanghai. The tram company will send workers on the 3rd to repair the tracks in the Japanese Concession and will open the tram on the 4th. (2nd day, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The reservist volunteer corps organized by reservists was dissolved by order of the Japanese military department on the 2nd because the support team arrived in Tianjin. (2nd day, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese headquarters moved from the public hall back to the Haiguang Temple barracks on the 2nd. Trams can pass through the Japanese Concession on the 3rd, but are still not allowed to stop and sell tickets. (2nd day, Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Events Commentary</p>
<h3>Do Not Forget Disaster Relief While Resisting Japan</h3>
<p>Since the sudden outbreak of the September 18th Incident in the Northeast, our government and people have been anxiously considering resistance against Japan and self-preservation, focusing their attention externally. However, another serious and urgent problem within the country, no less significant than the Northeast Incident, has been largely ignored or even forgotten. What is this problem? It is the plight of the flood victims in sixteen provinces.</p>
<p>During the initial period of the floods in June and July, people across the country devised plans, discussed solutions, donated generously for relief, and actively appealed for help, demonstrating the greatness of human compassion. The government also established a Flood Relief Committee at the time and resolved to issue 50 million yuan in flood relief bonds. National public opinion and the attention of people nationwide were focused on disaster relief and the rehabilitation of disaster areas, recognizing it as a major calamity for our nation. However, with the occurrence of the September 18th Incident, the attention previously focused on the domestic floods shifted outwards. As a result, donations stopped, relief efforts stalled, and the resolution to issue 50 million yuan in bonds was effectively shelved. The 50 million disaster victims in sixteen provinces were left with shattered hopes, sinking further into a desperate situation with no means of appeal or survival.</p>
<p>The year is drawing to a close. The north wind is biting, and frost and snow are intertwined. The dwellings of these 50 million disaster victims have been swept away by the floods, and their fields have been ravaged by the raging waves. Emaciated and wretched, they huddle in the cold wind, suffering from the pangs of hunger and the torment of severe cold. Stricken by both hunger and cold, their will to live is completely broken. Today, if we close our eyes and silently contemplate the tragic scene of our compatriots in the disaster areas, scattered across the desolate fields, desperately waiting for rescue, we should understand that, as the year ends and the weather turns cold, disaster relief for our compatriots in the disaster areas cannot be neglected or delayed in any way. In other words, those of us who are fortunate enough not to have directly suffered from the floods must not stand idly by and watch our compatriots in the vast disaster areas suffer from hunger, cold, and death without providing assistance.</p>
<p>In the current situation, foreign affairs are undoubtedly important, but domestic flood relief is equally vital to the survival of our nation and people. We cannot allow an inch of our territory to be easily lost, but neither can we stand idly by and watch as many as 50 million disaster victims sink into the abyss of death. Today, external threats are enough to destroy our country, and internal troubles are equally capable of doing so. Driven to desperation, what choice can there be? Stricken by hunger and cold, what is impossible to do? What turmoil cannot be created? The potential crisis looming this winter and spring is extremely serious. Gathering 50 million people desperately seeking to survive is no different from a prairie fire that cannot be approached. Under the spread of this prairie fire, who can guarantee that our country will not immediately experience a sudden transformation? Therefore, while external affairs are urgent, internal affairs are also extremely serious. In the entire society, it is unacceptable for a majority of the people to be unable to seek death or find a way to live, while only a minority can enjoy wealth and honor, spending their years in comfort and joy. For us to be satiated while others are hungry and cold, for us to be laughing while others are weeping, is not only morally unacceptable but also utterly detrimental to our own interests.</p>
<p>The government's resolution to issue 50 million yuan in flood relief bonds has now been effectively shelved. We truly do not understand the reasons for the suspension of these bonds. Does it mean that because of the outbreak of foreign aggression, domestic disasters no longer need to be addressed? Or can the life and death of these 50 million people be left to fate? Alas, the dead lie exposed, and the living are displaced. This tragic picture of disaster victims, a scene of utter devastation, is presented before our eyes. How can our government and people allow ourselves to forget it for even a day?</p>
<p>Today, we solemnly appeal to our government and our people: Do not forget internal affairs while dealing with external affairs; do not forget disaster relief while resisting tyranny. The wailing cries of the 50 million victims are being carried across the fields by the biting cold wind. Let us try to listen.</p>
<p>Important Domestic Telegrams Received</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Approximately seventy Japanese sailors left the Japanese Concession this morning and boarded a ship at the riverbank in the British Concession, bound for Tanggu, in order to return to their original ships. It is expected that another batch of sailors will also return to their ships soon, as Japanese infantry troops arrived in Tianjin yesterday, making it unnecessary for sailors to remain stationed here. These sailors were transferred to Tianjin on November 27th. Tianjin was very quiet last night. (Reuters telegram, 2nd)</p>

<h3>Military Attaches from Various Countries</h3>
<p>Depart from Jinzhou for Inspection</p>
<p>Heading to Raoyang River, Xinmin, and Other Locations</p>
<p>US Counselor Arrives Safely at Juliu River</p>
<p>Goubangzi Zhu Guangmu departed from Jinzhou on the morning of the 2nd, accompanied by military attaches from various countries, including US's Magruder, UK's Dannatt, and France's Mons, to inspect the damage caused by the Japanese army in Raoyang River and Tongliao. (Special dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>Goubangzi US Counselor O'Dell arrived at Tangjiawobao from Dahu Mountain by car on the morning of the 2nd. However, due to the three railway bridges between Tangjiawobao and Liuhegou being destroyed by the Japanese army, he switched to a handcar and walked part of the way. He then took a car from Liuhegou eastward, arriving at Juliu River. There are no Japanese troops west of Xinmin. (Special dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The inspection delegation from various countries departed from Jinzhou by special train for Xinmin at 1:25 AM on the morning of the 2nd. However, whether they can reach their destination will be decided upon arrival at Dahu Mountain. (Special dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhu Guangmu and Cai Yuan arrived in Jinzhou at noon on the 1st, met with Rong Zhen, conveyed Vice Commander Zhang's instructions, met with the foreign inspectors, and returned to Beiping after a brief stay. (Special dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to a telegram from Jinzhou, British military attache Dannatt, French military attache Sansse, US military attache Magruder, and German and French army counselors departed for Baiqibao and Tongliao on the morning of the 2nd to inspect the damage caused by the Japanese army to the county towns and railways. They plan to return to Jinzhou soon and report their findings to their respective countries. (Special dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A certain inspector received a report from Paris stating that the Japanese side has been continuously spreading propaganda internationally, alleging that the Chinese side is continuing to increase troops in the Dahu Mountain and Shanhaiguan areas, and claiming that the incident at Raoyang River on the 27th was initiated by our troops firing artillery at the Japanese army. However, since the arrival of inspectors from various countries in Jinzhou, they have been inspecting various locations for days, and the facts speak for themselves, refuting the Japanese side's intentions. Although the Japanese have withdrawn their troops attacking Jinzhou, whether they have other plans should not be ignored, and optimism about establishing a neutral zone is unwarranted.

<p>(Beiping) Inspectors from the UK, US, and France are scheduled to go to Dahu Mountain and Zhangwu for inspection on the 2nd. (Special dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) German Counselor Landow arrived in Beiping at noon on the 1st. (Special dispatch, 2nd)</p>

At 10:40 PM last night, the Jinzhou Command Headquarters telegraphed that Zhang Xueliang's representative had arrived and is currently in contact with the foreign inspectors. It was also stated that the inspectors from the UK, France, and the US are scheduled to leave Jinzhou on the 2nd to inspect the situation in Dahu Mountain.

<p>Purely to Maintain Order</p>
<p>(Harbin) Zhang Jinghui issued a statement, stating: "This is to inform that the reason why this official has dispatched Ying Shun, the deputy director of the Special Zone Administration, to Jiang province with a security detachment is purely because Jiang province's provincial defenses are weak and to assist in maintaining order. However, there are meddlesome individuals fabricating rumors and publishing them in special editions, falsely claiming that so-and-so will be appointed as a department head, and so-and-so as a bureau chief. These are pure rumors and have no basis whatsoever. This announcement is made in the newspapers to clarify the truth." (Special dispatch, 2nd)</p>

<h3>Cheng Tianfang's Statement</h3>
<p>Reports of Requesting Russian Assistance are Untrue</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Shanghai newspapers on the 2nd carried a Havas news agency telegram from Riga stating that the Chinese representative in Russia had requested military assistance from Karakhan, which had been refused. Reporters interviewed Cheng Tianfang, the deputy minister of the Central Propaganda Department, to inquire about the situation. According to him, there was absolutely no such thing. China currently only has Mo Dehui in Russia negotiating the issue of the Chinese Eastern Railway, and there is no charge d'affaires. The National Government is currently seeking a just resolution to the issue of the three northeastern provinces through diplomatic channels. How could there be any intention of requesting Russian assistance? Such news is likely deliberately spread by the Japanese side to divert world attention. Two weeks ago, during the fighting between Ma Zhanshan and the Japanese, the Japanese side claimed that Ma's ammunition was supplied by Russia, but in reality, it was sold by a certain Japanese company in Dalian. Reporters also inquired about the rumors that China and Japan will engage in direct negotiations and that Zhang Xueliang will negotiate with the Japanese. Cheng said that Zhang has repeatedly stated that his diplomatic policy is to absolutely obey the intentions of the Central Government and that there is no possibility of direct negotiations without regard for the Central Government. As for the Central Government, it has long stated that it will not withdraw troops and will not negotiate with the Japanese. It is currently awaiting a resolution from the League of Nations and will definitely not engage in direct negotiations with the Japanese. This is also deliberately created by the Japanese side. (Central News Agency telegram, 2nd)</p>

They stated that they are heading north to Jinzhou with three principles: (1) to swear to go north and expel the Japanese; (2) to disregard whether there are economic means; (3) to disregard the number of branches or lack thereof and vow to fight with hot blood and their heads to promote the national spirit.

<h3>Chiang Kai-shek Receives</h3>
<p>Students Petitioning from Beiping and Xuzhou Yesterday</p>
<p>Gu Weijun Responds with Five Points</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At 9:00 AM on the 2nd, the petitioning delegations from Yanjing University in Beiping and various schools in Xuzhou went to the Central Party Headquarters to petition. Chiang Kai-shek received them, expressed his condolences and acceptance, and said that he had repeatedly announced in the newspapers his acceptance of the opinions of students petitioning from various locations and his determination to go to the country's aid, which could be clearly understood upon reading. Now that the country's difficulties are growing, the government and the people each have their responsibilities. The people must trust the government and support the Central Government so that there is genuine unity within the country and there is no hindrance to diplomacy, so that we can speak of resisting aggression and plan for national salvation. He would go north after the Central Plenary Session, etc. The petitioning delegations were satisfied, shouted slogans, and left. They then went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to petition, where they were received by Gu Weijun, who responded to each point as follows: (1) Jinzhou is our country's territory, and the importance of its sovereignty does not allow foreign interference. However, the League of Nations, due to the proximity of Chinese and Japanese troops, feared that it would easily trigger a war, so it proposed the establishment of a neutral zone so that the Japanese army could no longer advance. (2) The reports that Zhang Xueliang negotiated with the Japanese side and recognized the five principles are absolutely not true. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has received a telegram from Zhang stating that there is no such thing. Shigemitsu's visit to Beijing this time was to offer congratulations in accordance with international practice. During the meeting, he spoke about Japan's position and attitude towards the League of Nations. I also told him about our country's position and attitude, and nothing else. (3) The most important thing that our side considers and must insist on in Sino-Japanese negotiations is the issue of troop withdrawal. Before the issue of troop withdrawal is resolved, there is no possibility of discussing other issues. (4) The issue of resuming diplomatic relations between China and Russia should be carefully considered. After I arrived at the Ministry, I instructed the responsible official to submit all details of past negotiations with Russia for review in order to determine the direction. (5) My diplomatic policy is to follow Sun Yat-sen's teachings and strive to fulfill my responsibility to preserve the territory and uphold sovereignty. (Special dispatch, 2nd)</p>

<h3>Indian Round Table Conference Concludes</h3>
<p>British Prime Minister Announces Policy Towards India</p>
<p>National Issues Reach Impasse</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 1st - The Indian Round Table Conference held its final meeting today. British Prime Minister MacDonald announced the British government's policy, which will be published in the form of a white paper and submitted to both Houses of Parliament this week. It is rumored that the British Prime Minister stated that, in the opinion of the British government, an all-India federation is the only real solution to the difficulties. The British government supports the principle of a responsible central government, but with reservations and safeguards during the transition period. Various parties have urged the British government to immediately implement a complete plan for responsible government in all provinces of India, and the Round Table Conference also desires to have an all-encompassing charter. Therefore, only partial progress has been made in this area, but it is not welcomed by all the representatives. Under these circumstances, the British government is unwilling to make a partial solution to this, and it is not necessary to make an irreversible decision at present, as the situation may change. The greatest obstacle to the progress of both the provinces and the central government is the impasse on national issues, but the government is unwilling to acknowledge that this temporary failure is of a permanent nature. If the Indians themselves cannot resolve this matter, then the British government will have no choice but to apply a temporary plan. The second step in the future constitutional development of India must come from the Round Table Conference Committee, which will conduct its work in India and maintain close contact with the British government. All financial and other issues, as well as the Indian participation system, will be handled by this committee. Although this conference has not fulfilled all the wishes of the participants, it is a great improvement compared to the position a year ago. Although a complete solution has not yet been found, the British government is willing to continue to work hard to ensure that each other's efforts are successful. After the British Prime Minister finished speaking, the entire room was silent. Finally, the British Prime Minister rose and announced that the conference was now closed. The British Prime Minister then approached Gandhi and shook his hand. The two looked at each other and spoke a few words in a low voice. It is not known what they said. The British Prime Minister then shook hands with each representative one by one, and the participants left in succession.</p>
<p>Havas, London, 1st - This afternoon, Gandhi received representatives of the press in the living room of a certain hotel in Britain. He sat around the fireplace and looked tired. His voice was low and almost inaudible. He often paused when speaking. The gist of what he said was that what worried him was not what the Round Table Conference was doing, but the events that were happening in India at this time. The situation in India, especially in Bengal, was very worrying. Given this situation, he did not see any great results that could be hoped for from the Round Table Conference. The events in Bengal that Gandhi referred to were the recently announced orders, which granted special powers to the government to suppress so-called terrorism. Gandhi believed that, based on his personal experience, the government became panicked every time a European was harmed, and this had become a habit. Gandhi said that he deeply hated disruptive behavior, but the government's repressive measures were also startling. If the complete freedom that the Indian people demanded could not be granted one day, then terrorism could not be eradicated one day. The Indian people deeply abhorred violence, so Gandhi continued to advocate non-resistance and continue to work hard, regardless of whether the government could realize it. Gandhi planned to leave London before Saturday, the 6th, and arrive at Neuchâtel near Geneva at 6:00 PM that afternoon. He will stay at the home of the writer Romain Rolland and then leave from there via Rome to Brindisi, where he will buy a boat to return to India.</p>
<p>National News Agency, London, 1st - The Indian Round Table Conference failed to achieve the goal of drafting a constitution for an all-India independent federation. The reason for this was entirely due to the failure of the representatives or the British government to resolve the issue of minority protection. In addition, complex issues such as foreign affairs, finance, and the control of Indian troops were discussed in the latter half of the conference, but when Gandhi failed to find a way to resolve the minority issue, the conference was already doomed to failure. Although meetings continued to be held thereafter, they were merely delaying the matter. Since the formal meeting did not reach an agreement, private talks between minority and Hindu representatives were of little effect. The minority issue is actually a combination of dozens of interconnected issues. For example, although Hindus account for the vast majority of the population in British-controlled areas, they are also a minority in the provinces of Bengal, the Northwest Frontier, and Sindh. Muslims in British India number 70 million and are the most complex minority issue. In addition, there are the oppressed classes, the Sikhs, the Parsis, the Christians, the Anglo-Indians, and European interests, all of which are major issues. Muslims account for the vast majority in the Northwest Frontier Province and Sindh, 56% of the residents in Bengal, and 54% in Bengal. In other provinces, they are only a minority, but Muslims have been at the center of the provincial legislative councils in these provinces for 20 years. Therefore, at this conference, they insisted on guaranteeing the rights of the majority representatives in the legislative councils of Bengal and Bengal, that is, they always occupy 51% of the representatives in the provincial legislative council. The Sikhs are concentrated in Bengal. When the British annexed the province, the Sikhs were the rulers of the province. Therefore, this time they joined forces with the Hindus to argue that it is not fair to guarantee the majority rights of Muslims in the provincial legislative council, because the center of the parliament should be held by that ethnic group, just as Muslims in provinces where Muslims are in the minority still hold the center of the legislative council. Hindus also strongly opposed guaranteeing the majority rights of Muslims in Bengal, believing that Hindus might have the opportunity to become the majority in the future. The oppressed classes number no less than 50 or 60 million throughout India, but they are scattered in various provinces and are all minorities, so it is an extremely complex issue. However, the current negotiations are focused on the issue of Bengal. Those who are at the forefront of the negotiations now believe that if there is a satisfactory solution to the issue between Hindus and Muslims, it will not be difficult for other minorities to resolve their issues on their own.</p>

<p>Beiping Correspondence: Due to the westward advance of the Japanese army, the situation in Jinzhou was very tense for the past few days. The night before last (28th) at 9:30 PM, Japanese Chargé d'Affaires Yano met with Zhang Zuoxiang and stated that he had received instructions from his country that the Tokyo government had informed the French ambassador that it accepted the Chinese side's suggestion of a neutral zone and had instructed Honjo Shigeru to withdraw the troops advancing west back to the South Manchuria Railway-affiliated area within Shenyang. As for the administrative and police powers within the future neutral zone, etc., which are related to Chinese sovereignty, they will also be controlled by the Chinese side. Zhang replied that, as of today (28th), he had not received instructions from the Central Government regarding the establishment of a neutral zone and was not at liberty to act on his own. Since he had been informed of the Tokyo government's opinion in good faith, he would telegraph it to the Central Government for instructions. He also stated that the rumors that he (Zhang himself) had entrusted French Ambassador Wilden to suggest the establishment of a neutral zone were speculative and that there was no such suggestion in Beiping, and that Ambassador Wilden had been in Beijing for a long time and had no way to contact him. However, if the Central Government issues an order</p>

<p>instructing him (Zhang himself) to handle this matter, he would be willing to proceed accordingly. In addition, there was also discussion on the Tianjin incident, and it was decided not to allow the situation to escalate. Both sides have been informed to comply. The tense situation has suddenly eased. At the same time, the Japanese army advancing west from Shenyang has indeed stopped attacking Dagushan and began to withdraw east on the morning of yesterday (29th). All the Japanese troops in Juliuhe have been withdrawn. The garrison in Xinmin is also withdrawing. Zhang Zuoxiang, a member of the Committee for Receiving Lost Territories in the Northeast, took a special train to Jinzhou yesterday (29th) at 4:00 AM. Because it was at night and the special train was driven to Qihuamen, he boarded the train from the Qihuamen station, so few people knew about it. (November 30th)</p>
<h3>Grim Situation in Tianjin</h3>
<p>Situation Slightly Calmed After Security Forces Withdraw</p>
<p>Authorities Issue Proclamations and Notes to Various Legations</p>
<p>Investigation of Damage to Local Areas by Japanese Artillery Shells</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Since the evening of November 26th, a second serious situation has unfolded here. Japanese forces have repeatedly shelled Chinese-controlled areas with heavy artillery, resulting in an unprecedented tragedy. As the reporter's residence is near the Hebei Provincial Government, it has been particularly targeted by artillery shells. The windows rattled violently whenever a shell landed, demonstrating the immense power of the artillery. Fortunately, the shells mostly landed in open areas and in the river in front of the provincial government, so the damage was not as severe as in the southern part of the city. Although the situation has eased somewhat on the surface over the past two days, the future remains uncertain. Due to the curfew, the reporter has been unable to go out for several days. The recent situation is described below:</p>
<p>The most dangerous phase of the incident occurred on the nights of the 27th and 28th. The Japanese planned to deploy 64 aircraft from Shenyang and a brigade of infantry to Tianjin to carry out an occupation, and at the same time advance on Jinzhou from Xinmin in a two-pronged attack. Their ambition extends beyond seizing the three northeastern provinces and is now directed towards North China. This is a confirmed fact. The Japanese consul in Tianjin had notified the consuls of various countries, ordering foreign nationals in Tianjin to evacuate by 6:00 PM on the 27th to avoid the danger of war. Coincidentally, on that day, telegrams arrived from Paris and Washington, D.C., stating that the League of Nations and the United States viewed the Japanese advance on Jinzhou with grave concern. The American attitude, in particular, drew the attention of the Japanese. It is reported that the Japanese militarists, concerned about escalating the issue, have ordered the Japanese forces stationed in Shenyang to halt their advance on Tianjin. At the same time, the consular corps offered friendly advice to the Japanese, so the serious situation has eased somewhat today, except for another artillery barrage by the Japanese military around 5:00 AM yesterday. Meanwhile, the provincial and municipal authorities, recognizing that Tianjin is a mixed Chinese and foreign settlement where the lives and property of millions of merchants and residents are at stake, and fearing even greater devastation should a rupture occur, yesterday agreed to the Japanese demand to withdraw all security forces to Hebei to prevent the Japanese from using it as a pretext to provoke further challenges. This negotiation was conducted by Zhou Longguang, Ning Xiangnan, and Xie Juchuan, specially appointed by the municipal government, who went to the Japanese military camp in Haiguang Temple to exchange views with Commander Kashii. Only after the Japanese were satisfied was the withdrawal carried out. According to the plan, the police will still maintain order in the Henan area, allowed to carry handguns and grenades. If plainclothes soldiers are discovered, they may retaliate. If a large group of plainclothes soldiers attacks, the Japanese will be notified first to request assistance from the security forces. Starting at 4:00 PM yesterday (29th), our side ordered all security forces in various defense areas, such as Nankai, Dongma Road, Nanma Road, and Nanshi, to withdraw to Hebei for concentration. The withdrawal was completed by 6:00 PM. The authorities also dispatched special commissioners to various locations to inspect and, after the withdrawal, notified the Japanese, expressing our sincerity for peace. Therefore, no artillery fire has been heard since last night until this morning (30th). We cannot take this state of affairs as a sign of Japan's genuine desire for peace. The reason for not continuing its atrocities is related to the abandonment of the attack on Jinzhou. In essence, it is a matter of military internationalization. Currently, merchants and residents in the Henan area are finding themselves in even greater danger due to the withdrawal of security forces, and many are moving to the British and French concessions to seek refuge. The flow of people seeking refuge is unprecedented. In the Hebei area, there are few pedestrians and shops are closed, creating a stagnant atmosphere. After withdrawing the security forces, the government today issued a proclamation to reassure the people and sent notes to the Japanese consul and consuls of various countries. The texts are as follows: (1) Proclamation: Regarding the matter of a proclamation, since the disturbances caused by plainclothes soldiers in this city, the police force has been strictly supervised and has made every effort to suppress them. However, due to the mixed Chinese and foreign nature of the area, there are many considerations, making it difficult to eradicate the root of the problem and preventing thorough suppression. This situation has persisted for several weeks without being resolved, as all merchants and residents of the city know. Upon investigation, the area around the southeast corner of Zhakou is riddled with damage and has long been a place where plainclothes soldiers appear. Even the slightest carelessness in dealing with this situation could lead to international disputes, causing Chinese and foreign merchants and residents living there to be in the midst of gunfire and bullets every day, with unspeakable damage to lives and property. The mayor has given this matter careful consideration and feels deeply troubled. Now, in order to reduce the danger to Chinese and foreign merchants and residents and to avoid international misunderstandings, the security forces in that area have been temporarily withdrawn separately, and the patrol police have been ordered to restore their original positions and earnestly maintain order. It is hoped that all Chinese and foreign merchants and residents in the city will live in peace and not cause unnecessary alarm. If any unscrupulous individuals spread rumors or create trouble, they will be severely punished without leniency once discovered. This proclamation is hereby issued to all merchants and residents for their information. (2) Note to the Japanese Consul: Regarding the matter of a note, since the incident that occurred in this city on the 8th of this month, there have been frequent disputes between our two sides. In order to avoid misunderstandings between the two sides, the mayor has once again taken the initiative to gradually withdraw all security forces separately. Chairman Wang has sent personnel to negotiate with your military, and the withdrawal has been implemented starting at 4:00 PM on the 29th of this month. This is to inform you accordingly, and I hope you will take note. It is essential to issue this note. (3) Note to the Consuls of Various Countries: Regarding the matter of a note, since the incident that occurred in this city on November 8th, the mayor, in order to avoid misunderstandings between China and Japan, ordered the security forces to retreat 300 meters from the vicinity of the Japanese concession. Unexpectedly, the Japanese military has still not been able to fully understand, and on the evening of the 26th of this month, there was another artillery bombardment, affecting both Chinese and foreign residents. Now, in order to show that the mayor has no hostile intentions towards the Japanese side, all security forces have been voluntarily withdrawn gradually and separately. Personnel have been sent to negotiate with the Japanese side, and it has been agreed that the withdrawal will be implemented starting at 4:00 PM this afternoon. This note is hereby issued for the information of your Consul-General. It is essential to issue this note.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Japanese military has fired no fewer than dozens of shells at the entire city of Tianjin in recent days. In addition to the previous reports, the following locations have been further investigated: (1) Inside the courtyard of the 5th Company of the Security Forces at Xiaolongwang Temple along the riverbank, one shell landed, creating a hole about five feet wide. (2) In front of the Hebei Provincial Government gate, one 12 cm artillery shell landed and exploded. Fortunately, no one was injured. (3) The roof of the Hebei Provincial Government hall was destroyed by a shrapnel shell, and dozens of small projectiles landed in the courtyard. Shrapnel shells are shaped like pomegranates and contain hundreds of small projectiles connected like beads. They contain a fuze connected to all the small projectiles, capable of timing and corresponding to distance. After being aimed and fired, they explode upon reaching the destination. Another feature is that they do not need to touch anything to explode in the air, making them extremely powerful. They were originally designed for attacking skirmish lines. International agreements prohibit their use in cities, similar to poisonous gas artillery. However, the Japanese military disregarded international law and used them brazenly, which is intolerable under public law. (4) In the river at Jingang Bridge, seven or eight shells landed on the evening of the 26th, and over twenty shells landed on the evening of the 27th. Only one shell landed on the stern deck of a thatched boat, immediately exploding with a thunderous sound. Fortunately, the boatmen escaped ashore unharmed. Soon after, the boat sank. (5) One shell landed in the empty courtyard of the Zhongxing Bathhouse, 300 steps east of the Provincial Government. All the buildings in the courtyard were damaged by the explosion, but no one was injured. (6) One shell each landed inside the Li Gong Ancestral Hall and at the intersection of Huangwei Road. (7) One 12 cm artillery shell landed next to the Hebei Power Plant and the Jijiayao Xinhe Teahouse, destroying the entire building. It was fired from Haiguang Temple and followed a straight trajectory. (8) One shell landed next to the 5th Elementary School in the 1st District of Hebei, destroying residential buildings. (9) A shell landed on Huangwei Road in Hebei, with the intended target being the municipal government. (10) Over ten shells landed on Dongma Road, and one shell also landed in front of the Tongsheng Photo Studio. (11) Three or four shells landed on the main street outside the South Gate. (12) Two shells landed at the Caochang'an temple on Nanma Road. (13) A total of forty to fifty shells landed in the Huaiqingli Ningjia Bridge Fort Village area. The above is the situation before the 28th, but there are still areas that have not been investigated. On the morning of the 29th, the Japanese side again bombarded the Chinese area, firing many shells, all of which were 12 cm large-caliber shrapnel shells. Our side did not retaliate against the Japanese side. At 5:30, they also strafed our defense line with machine guns from Xiatou in Nanguan until 6:00 before stopping. The damage in the attacked areas was extensive. The damage and locations are as follows: (1) Five shells landed in Huaiqingli, destroying one room of the western building of the 20th Company Headquarters. Windows were destroyed inside courtyard number 19 in the same lane, injuring two civilians. The eastern building of the Xia courtyard at number 14 was destroyed. (2) Two grenade launcher shells landed near Huaiqingli. The extent of the damage is pending investigation. (3) One shell landed on the south side of the road in the middle of Zhongxisi Main Street. The extent of the damage is pending investigation. (4) Two shrapnel shells landed on Jianwu Main Street, exploding in the air. The extent of the damage is unknown. (5) Two 12 cm artillery shells landed at the Caochang'an Police Training Center, destroying several buildings and creating a huge crater five feet deep. (6) One shell landed in the courtyard of the Tang family residence at number 18, south entrance of Dong Hutong in Caochang'an, destroying windows but not injuring anyone. (7) One shell landed at the residence of an employee of the Shenchang Foreign Firm at Nanzhakou, destroying the building. Because the residents had already moved away, there was no loss. (8) At 1:16 PM, a Japanese small vessel carrying Japanese soldiers sailed north from Zhakou. The police on the shore raised their hands and ordered it to return. The Japanese soldiers on the vessel fired at them. The bullet passed through the coat. The soldiers guarding the Italian Concession heard the noise and all came out. The vessel then turned back.

<h3>Japanese Plotting Disturbance in Jiaodong</h3>
<p>Five Japanese Warships in Zhifu Port</p>
<p>Japanese Consulate Building Wireless Radio Station</p>
<p>Yantai Correspondence: Since the Tianjin Incident, the Japanese have shown a great ambition to seize key locations in North China in one fell swoop. The Japanese conspiracy in Qingdao, south of Yantai, has been discovered successively. The Qingdao Public Security Bureau has arrested those instigated by the Japanese, armed plainclothes, who confessed to being hired by the Japanese and provided with firearms and bombs to create a second Tianjin. Four Japanese warships, including the Wuzhu, are still anchored in Qingdao Port. The Shandong Provincial Government, in preparation for any eventuality, has strictly ordered the cities of Qingdao and Jinan to be on alert. Warships are also anchored in Zhifu and Longkou. Those stationed in Zhifu Port are the four 13th Destroyer Division ships newly transferred from Japan and one transport ship, fully loaded with ordnance and marines. Sailors often patrol ashore, hoping to cause incidents. On November 26th, they also took films of various agencies and key locations without authorization. At the consulate, they dug a thirty-foot deep pit, intending to build their own wireless radio station, which shows their contempt for our country's sovereignty. The Japanese consul has secretly ordered Japanese residents to leave the country, and many have been leaving in recent days, causing the local atmosphere to be extremely tense. The 21st Division of the Army stationed in Yantai, in order to prevent accidents, has implemented a curfew since last night to prevent the Japanese from causing trouble everywhere.

<h3>Japanese Consul in Shandong</h3>
<p>Reports Withdrawal of Troops to Han Fuju</p>
<p>Japanese Residents Do Not Want Japan to Send Troops to Shandong Again</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Amidst the deteriorating Sino-Japanese situation here, news came last night that the Japanese forces in our three northeastern provinces suddenly showed signs of withdrawal. Today (30th), Han Fuju spoke about this, saying that radio broadcasts from Nanjing and telegrams from Jinzhou all indicated that the Japanese forces were withdrawing to within the South Manchurian Railway zone. Those in Xinmin have also returned to Shenyang, which is probably the case. However, it is difficult to predict whether this is a permanent withdrawal or a temporary one, such as a plan to deal with the League of Nations. Since the Northeast Incident, there has not been a day without storms and heavy rain. Shandong, under these circumstances, and the ports along the coast of Qingdao and the railway zone of the Jiaoji Railway, are still as peaceful as ever. However, some Japanese are still stirring up trouble in Qingdao. If there is hope for a resolution to the Northeast Incident soon, the Qingdao area, I believe, will not have any problems for the time being. If it is delayed for a long time, then it is difficult to say, etc.</p>
<p>The Japanese Consul-General in Jinan, Nishida Koichi, personally visited Chairman Han at the Provincial Government at 3:30 PM today (30th) to report on the withdrawal of Japanese troops and discuss measures to protect Japanese residents. He had not left by around 5:00 PM. According to the information from the Japanese Consulate, the Japanese troops in the Juliuhe area and west of Juliuhe have been ordered to withdraw to Shenyang. As for the Japanese residents in Jinan, in view of the May 3rd Incident, Japanese troops occupied Jinan, and the residents suffered losses and gained no benefit. Therefore, most do not want Japan to send troops to Shandong again this time to avoid being affected again. (November 30th)</p>
<p>Local Correspondence</p>
<h3>Nanhui</h3>
<p>Consistent Opposition to the Guihua Border Demarcation: The Fengxian County Government previously submitted a request to the Provincial Department of Civil Affairs to have Taiping and other villages in this county placed under its jurisdiction. The department ordered this county government to review and respond. The county government organized the Nanhui County Boundary Committee, which held a meeting the other day and unanimously opposed the proposal. It also appointed committee members Xu Shouqing and others to draft a rebuttal of Fengxian's justification for the border demarcation and submit it to the Department of Civil Affairs. Subsequently, the County Chamber of Commerce, Bureau of Education, Farmers' Association, Education Association, Property Office, Relief Agency, and others initiated a conference to protect the border. It was held yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM in the Biyutang Hall in the city, with representatives from all walks of life reaching several hundred people. At the meeting, it was resolved to oppose the placement of Taiping and other villages under the jurisdiction of Fengxian. Pan Ziping and others were elected as representatives to go to the provincial government to petition. A fundraising campaign for border protection expenses of 500 yuan was launched and personnel were assigned to solicit donations to strengthen the advocacy efforts.</p>
<h3>Fengxian</h3>
<p>Dispute Over the Fengnan Border Demarcation Case: Regarding the Fengnan border demarcation case, since this joint conference, the discussions concluded that both sides recognize the need for organization and consolidation in fact. Therefore, in addition to the county government submitting the resolution to the provincial government and representatives of various agencies going to the province to request a decision, yesterday Nanhui also had representatives of the people from the tenth district (i.e., the old Taiping and Duxing villages), He Baoyi, Zhang Bangjie, Ding Zheng, and others, telegraph to the province to petition, stating that the fifteen villages west of Jinhuitang in this district had approved the consolidation under the jurisdiction of Fengxian in the public assembly on the 22nd of this month. The details of the meeting had already been jointly submitted by the village heads for review. It is requested that this case of aligning borders is purely based on the Zhengbian Department's outline for the reorganization of county districts and adopts genuine public opinion. It is lawful and reasonable in every way. However, recently, it has been learned that the county party is limited by feudal ideas and has organized committees for boundary protection and other committees, without seeking the sympathy of the local people or convening the public to participate in the discussions. Their intention is nothing more than to bury the facts and deceive the authorities. In order to dare to uphold justice, they are acting on behalf of thousands of people in the fifteen villages west of Jinhuitang in this district to express their will. It is requested that the lower-level circumstances be followed and a decision be made as soon as possible. Urgent words, awaiting clear instructions.</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>District Branch Opposes Border Demarcation: Fengxian County is plotting to annex various villages and towns in the fourteenth and fifteenth districts of Songjiang. The people of the two districts have unanimously opposed it, and it has been denied in the fourth county administrative meeting. Now, the county party headquarters also received a telegram from the third district and second branch stating that Fengxian County intends to annex the area east of Yexietang, passing through Huan'an, Caojing, Zhaolin, and reaching Chongque, and place it under its jurisdiction. The people of Punan are extremely angry. At a time when the national situation is in danger, the Fengxian County Magistrate does not think about ways to save the country and resist foreign aggression, but instead plots to encroach on the county boundary, violating public opinion and causing disputes. An urgent telegram to your council requests that it be forwarded to the county government and lodged a serious protest, arguing for the cause, to comfort the people. The county party headquarters believes that changing the county boundary is actually related to the interests of local enterprises, and immediately forwarded a letter based on the telegram to the government, lodging a serious protest, so as to avoid annexation.</p>
<p>Students from Chizhi College Come to Songjiang to Publicize: Pan Jianbo and six other comrades from the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of Chizhi College in Shanghai came to Songjiang today to work hard to publicize the issue. They discussed the methods of proceeding with the county party headquarters and decided to convene a discussion with people from all walks of life at 9:00 AM on the 2nd at the county party headquarters to exchange opinions. In the afternoon, they went to the countryside to publicize the issue.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>The Trend of Collecting Feast Tax on Behalf Continues Unabated: The Suzhou City Restaurant Industry has faced a major dispute over opposition to the collection of feast tax on its behalf. Five representatives of the industry, including Wang Xiangbao, have been detained by the Public Security Bureau. Yesterday, the industry separately submitted requests to the Provincial Government's Department of Finance and Education, requesting that personnel be sent to investigate. The 27 industry associations, including the Iron Machine and others, also telegraphed the provincial departments to investigate. All members of the industry went to the County Party Headquarters yesterday (2nd) to petition. Wang Ashui, a representative of the industry, was also summoned and detained by the Public Security Bureau yesterday. Among the five people arrested the other day, Qin Ziyuan has been released, and the rest have not yet been released. Yesterday, the county government also received an order from the Department of Education, ordering that it be handled prudently. It is said that Merchant Han Mutao has voluntarily backed down and eliminated the recognition of the merchant. The focus of the dispute now is that the restaurants do not want to take on the responsibility of guaranteeing the payment and only agree to actually collect and remit. The official side must order them to guarantee a monthly payment of 1,300 yuan.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Debate Concludes on the Case of the Party Committee Being Accused of Fraud: The case of the former Supervisory Committee Member of the County Party Headquarters of this county, Shi Minyong, being accused of defrauding and obtaining money by Tong Shizhong has been heard in the Wu County District Court for three trials. On the 3rd of last month, the plaintiff, defendant, and witnesses were summoned to court for questioning. As a result, it was announced that the debate had concluded. Prosecutor Qian Yu's statement of intent was roughly that Shi Minyong's crime of intimidation and fraud was completely established. According to the law, a public prosecution was filed against him. The crime he committed, according to Shi's defense, was entirely for the sake of the people and for public affairs. That should be done in the name of the Party, but Shi acted entirely in his private capacity, which clearly violated the criminal law. The intent was to illegally obtain for oneself or a third party, and the fact that a trick was used to make people hand over property to oneself is clear. He asked the presiding judge to make a judgment. The presiding judge then instructed that the judgment would be announced on the 3rd of this month.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Department of Finance Discusses Business Tax Law: The Jiangsu Department of Finance, because the Jiangsu Province Business Tax Law is scheduled to be implemented in January of the 21st year, now that the deadline is approaching, urgently needs to revise the detailed rules for the implementation of the Jiangsu Province Business Tax and the tax rate table, and to study and improve collection methods. It has been specifically scheduled to invite representatives of the Chambers of Commerce of various counties to meet at the Department at 2:00 PM today (3rd). After receiving the letter, the Chamber of Commerce of this county invited representatives of various industries to a meeting at 4:00 PM on the 1st to solicit opinions. After the attending representatives Chen Zhanru and others expressed their opinions, it was decided to appoint Qian Sunqing as the representative to go to Zhenjiang by car in the afternoon of the 2nd, first contact the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce, and then attend the Department of Finance meeting.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Japanese Merchant Ship Aground, Seeking Help: The Wangjiatai Police Team outside the East Gate picked up a pigeon yesterday (1st) at Changshan, with an aluminum tube tied to its tail, containing a piece of paper in Japanese, issued by Asai, the owner of the Zuiyo Maru, at 9:55 on the 27th of last month, because the ship ran aground at a certain continent at 1:00 on the 25th. The middle of the ship's body showed slight cracks, but there was no major danger. The Daheng Wireless Radio Station had been damaged, and it was hoped that other ships would come to the rescue.

<p>Gao Liangfu Has Escaped Danger: Gao Liangfu, from West Main Street in the city, went to Xue Liquan's estate in Nanxing Town, Changshu, the other day (19th) to collect sand rent, and was kidnapped by bandits and hidden in a certain village in Nantong. A ransom of 63,000 was demanded. Because the military and police were searching very strictly, he escaped in the meantime and temporarily stayed at the Chuan Port Public Security Branch. Yesterday (29th) he telegraphed his family.</p>
<p>Provincial Executive Committee Sends Personnel to Investigate: The Provincial Party Headquarters sent He Xuyou to Cheng to investigate the illegal organization of the Ship Industry Union because it was accused of illegal organization. On the 29th, he went to the Ship Industry Union outside the North Gate and read the registers and other documents. He then spoke with Ren Shengxiang, a member of the Executive Committee, who examined the documents with He Wei. There was a clue. He Wei set a date to return to the province today (30th).</p>

<p>Students Go to the County Government to Petition for the Wu Case: The Wu County Students Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, because of the riot by traitorous merchants who beat and killed Wu Wenbi, an official of the Party Headquarters, and the culprit has not yet been apprehended, sent more than a dozen representatives, including Deng Dazhang, to the County Magistrate Zhang yesterday to petition. The representatives said that if the culprit is not brought to justice for one day, the case will not be resolved for one day, and everything in the local area will not progress. They demanded that the police chief and detective captain, who were ineffective in the arrest, be removed first, and then a short deadline be given, supplemented by a reward, so that they could be arrested within the deadline. County Magistrate Zhang sent Secretary Xu to reply, saying that another week would be given, and he would definitely arrest all the criminals. He also expressed that if there was no thorough solution, County Magistrate Zhang would resign. The representatives were satisfied and withdrew.</p>
<p>Kidnapping Occurs in the Fifth District: The house of Jin Yujiu, the head of Jinjia Village in Tan Ye Township in the Fifth District of Wu County, was suddenly attacked by more than 20 armed bandits the other night.

They left a letter, instructing him to prepare a ransom of 10,000 yuan.</p>

They then went to the employees' rooms and searched, robbing more than 200 yuan in silver dollars, and left with shouts. Zhu Qisheng and Ji Rongfa, tenants in Changgou Bay, were also robbed by bandits, who twisted Zhu Qisheng and forced him to hand over money, but they did not succeed and severely burned his body. The remaining bandits went to the house of Yu Henghe in Qianzhuang Township and used the same means, searching and robbing on a large scale. When the bandits left, they also told them not to report the case.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau Elementary and Secondary School Patriotic</h3>
<p>Activity Achievement Exhibition Registration</p>

<h3>A Glimpse Along the Way</h3>
<p>Starting Scene: Guanghua University students lined up in front, ready to go at the command, heading straight for the Great West Road, with Ma Darui taking the lead, followed by Peng Shuxin, Zhu Shoukai (Central), and Shu Zhaoxian, while Li Jin (Jiao), Sun Hupei (Fudan), Yin Yanjun (Central), etc., lagged behind.</p>
<p>On Hongqiao Road: After leaving the Great West Road, the runners entered Ferris Road and then Hongqiao Road. The positions gradually began to differentiate, with Shu Zhaoxian (Guang) and Zhou Mingzhang (Central) catching up. At that time, the rankings were as follows: Ma Fengrui, Shu Zhaoxian, Zhou Mingzhang, Peng Shuxin, Kong Guangyi, Jiang Lianggui, Hu Hongji, Ni Dashu, Gu Guangfu.</p>
<p>Further and Further Ahead: On Hongqiao Road, turning into Huobi Lan Road, Ma Fengrui moved further and further ahead, with Zhou Mingzhang trailing by fifty yards and Peng Shuxin another thirty yards behind. Shu Zhaoxian had fallen back to fourth place, while Central's Jiang Lianggui, Ni Dashu, and Jiang Wensen advanced successively. Central University had entered the most advantageous position.</p>
<p>Situation Stabilized: Entering Lincoln Road, crossing Zhongshan Road, only four hundred meters from the finish line, the rankings were now set. Spectators lined the sides of the road. Ma Fengrui was in the lead, one hundred meters ahead of Zhou Mingzhang, with Peng Shuxin fifty meters further behind. Liu Yibi and Zhu Shouxun were neck and neck, chasing, and Shu Zhaoxian kept pace with them. Jiang Lianggui, Ni Dashu, and Jiang Wensen were close behind. The top spot of Central University could not be taken by others. In a moment, Ma Fengrui reached the finish line.</p>

<p>When the Lincoln team first came, their reputation shook the sea, but after being defeated by Jinan in a friendly match, people began to disregard them.

<p>Madam Mardi Goes to Hong Kong</p>
<p>Due to a Cold and to Welcome Her Husband</p>
<p>Whether She Can Compete Upon Returning to Shanghai... Awaits Telegram</p>
<p>Tennis Queen Madam Mardi, who had just arrived in Shanghai, suddenly boarded the original ship, President Madison, yesterday morning to go to Hong Kong to visit her husband and then return to Shanghai together on the President Coolidge. Madame's trip to Hong Kong was unexpected. In fact, she suffered from a cold and was unable to play in Friday's match, so she decided to go to Hong Kong and then decide what to do. She has agreed to telegraph the Grass Court Club after arriving in Hong Kong to let them know whether she can compete on her second trip to Shanghai. The Grass Court Club will announce the news as soon as they receive a telegram. Those who have purchased tickets for the match should keep them temporarily pending the telegram, otherwise they can return the tickets to the Shiping Foreign Firm for a refund after Monday.</p>
<h3>Yesterday Evening's West YMCA Women's Basketball</h3>
<p>Liangjiang Loses to McLane</p>
<p>Result: 22 to 36</p>
<p>Shao Jingying Has an Amazing Performance</p>
<p>The Liangjiang Women's Basketball Team has long been famous. Yesterday, in the West YMCA Women's Basketball League, they met last year's champion, McLane. With a whistle, Captain Shao Jingying displayed her skill of hitting every shot, and the audience cheered wildly. In the first quarter, they took the lead with 10 to 2. However, McLane rose up, and Shao was marked, making it difficult for her to move. McLane's female players relied on their height advantage and took the lead everywhere, reversing the score to 20 to 15 in the first half. In the third quarter, Liangjiang suffered another blow and fell behind by _ to 8. In the fourth quarter, their morale improved slightly, but they were still no match for McLane's strength. As a result, McLane won with 36 to 22. In short, Liangjiang has Shao Jingying and Xi Jun on the outside, and Zhuang Shuyu and Wang Lan on the inside, all of whom are exceptional talents, with Shao Jingying being particularly outstanding. Unfortunately, the overall strength of the team is not evenly distributed, and yesterday's loss was not due to a lack of effort, but rather a lack of natural talent.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Results</h3>
<p>Junior Wins Blue Team 17 to 7</p>
<p>McLane Wins Liangjiang 36 to 22</p>
<p>Rowing Wins Youth B 46 to 3</p>

<p>Yesterday was the second day of the Shanghai Women's Basketball Association's games, with results in three groups: (1) Qiangdong defeated Shangzhong, 29 to 10, Group B, (2) Daxia defeated Nanyang, 21 to 13, Group B, (3) Group A, which was more exciting, and the result was that Southeast won a big victory with 48 to 6.</p>
<h3>Southeast Wins Against China (A)</h3>
<p>Southeast is one of the strongest teams in Shanghai, and China, lacking experience, was naturally no match for them. China only scored four points in the first half, 19 to 4, and only two points in the second half, resulting in a 48 to 6 victory for Southeast. Southeast's performance was skilled and enjoyable, with Pan Yueying being the most agile.</p>

<h3>A League Soccer Match</h3>
<p>Lehua Resists Western Police</p>
<p>Fails with a Score of Two to Five</p>
<p>Western Police Acted Out of Line Yesterday</p>
<p>Wei Gengsheng Was Sent Off</p>
<p>The Lehua team, which has repeatedly suffered defeats, met the strong Western Police soccer team yesterday, and how could they not be defeated? Although Lehua also launched a fierce attack in the second half and broke through the Western Police's goal twice, was it not commendable? The result was 5 to 2. The match was for the A League, and there were three to four hundred spectators. The referee was Jiang Xiangqing.</p>
<p>Lehua's Fierce Fight in the First Half: The Western Police began to attack immediately, and Lehua also fought hard to resist. For thirty minutes, the Western Police could not succeed. Only then did Wei Gengsheng score a goal on the left, opening the record. The first half ended with Wei Gengsheng scoring another goal, making it 2 to 0.</p>
<p>Western Police's Misconduct After Falling Behind: Five minutes into the second half,</p>
<p>Tuina shot in a goal from the center, making it 3 to 0. However, although Lehua was in a difficult situation, they continued to counterattack, approaching the Western Police's goal. Gu Shangdong shot fiercely on the side, and Ames caught it with both hands, but the forwards surged forward, and Ames retreated backwards. Jiang Xiangqing then declared Lehua the winner. Ames secretly moved up two steps, and the Western Police expressed their refusal to accept the decision. Those who supported the Western Police also started to bark in unison.</p>
<p>Resolutely Sending Wei Gengsheng Off: After that, the Western Police suddenly changed their normal behavior. Whenever Jiang Xiangqing made a decision that was unfavorable to the Western Police, they would step forward and argue. Tuina then attacked Lehua again, making it 4 to 1. Lehua continued to attack, and Jiang Chao kicked right in the center, hitting the Western Police, making it 4 to 2. The Western Police's attitude worsened, especially Wei Gengsheng's, which was unbearable. Jiang had no choice but to send him off the field. O'Clay then scored a goal, making it 5 to 2. The match ended without fanfare.</p>

<h3>Reflections from the Eaves</h3>
<p>— Yanzi</p>
<p>In the early years of the Guangxu reign of the late Qing Dynasty, Japan's Meiji Restoration was in full swing. Japan swallowed Ryukyu and coveted Korea, already regarding the Qing Dynasty as a sick man. However, Empress Dowager Cixi indulged in her own amusements, diverting naval funds to renovate the Summer Palace. Although Li Hongzhang and others strongly protested, it was to no avail. Observers had long known that a war between China and Japan was inevitable. When the Donghak Peasant Revolution broke out in Korea, the Qing court ordered Li Hongzhang to send troops to assist. At that time, Yuan Shikai was stationed in Korea, and being young and vigorous, he did not handle matters well. Ye Zhichao was ordered to lead Nie Shicheng, Zuo Baogui, and Wei Rugui to advance into Seoul, but they were not under unified command, leading to a defeat at Incheon and another defeat at Pyongyang. Zuo Baogui even sacrificed himself, which was praised by public opinion. Li Ming knew that the troops were unusable and intended to retreat to the Yalu River and defend Liaodong, ignoring the political changes in Korea. However, new and progressive scholars such as Zhang Jian and Yuan Xiangcheng indulged in political affairs and focused their criticism on Li. Consequently, Wu Dacheng's large camp collapsed, and 20,000 Xiang Army soldiers died in a bloody battle, making the overall situation almost unmanageable. Fortunately, Song Qing held Gaiping, and Ma Yukun and others defended Motianling, along with Yiketang'a's Eight Banner troops, forming a strategic defensive position. After repeated victories, the Japanese army became arrogant and overconfident, penetrating deep into the area, where they were ambushed and captured by Song and Ma, with over a thousand taken prisoner. At that time, Nie Shicheng's army was also known for its good fighting, but it was a pity that there was no one to command them, preventing them from launching a major offensive. Otherwise, the arrogant Japanese pirates might not have been so rampant.</p>
<p>Zhai Fu Talking Points That Do Not Eradicate the Garden Grass</p>
<h3>Dialogue Before the God of War (4)</h3>
<p>"That's right! I still have one more concern, and I'm hesitant. If we fight and lose, and lose and perish, we close our eyes and won't know any more pain. But the children will suffer the pain of national subjugation. Have you considered that for them? We can't pass on a better country to our descendants than what our ancestors left us, but instead, we lose it, causing our descendants to be subjugated for generations. When I ask myself, I feel uneasy."</p>
<p>"If you feel uneasy, how can I feel at ease? But the most precious legacy we should leave to our descendants is not gold or silver, but the spirit of unyielding courage. If we are willing to be subjugated without a fight, then our sons will learn from their fathers, and our grandsons will learn from their sons, and generation after generation will learn to be slaves, never able to turn over. But if we fight repeatedly and repeatedly fail, but still cannot avoid subjugation, then that righteous spirit of unyielding courage will soar to the heavens, spread across the four seas, and be passed down for ten thousand years without end. When it accumulates sufficiently, it will surely be like the Niagara Falls rushing to the sea and impossible to resist. At that time, it will naturally brew a total turnaround... the Chinese nation's turnaround, the Taiwanese nation's turnaround, the Korean nation's turnaround, the Japanese nation's turnaround, which is being controlled by the military and financial powers, and the turnaround of all oppressed nations in the world!"</p>
<p>"Looking at it that way, I also support war! I want to stand on the front line of justice and humanity and fight to the death with the Japanese warlords. Neither benefits, harms, fortune, misfortune, success, failure, survival, nor extinction can shake my belief in supporting war."</p>
<p>"Since you have established a firm belief in fighting for justice and humanity, I would like to give you some comfort. Only when you are not swayed by benefits, harms, fortune, misfortune, success, failure, survival, or extinction can you talk about benefits, harms, fortune, misfortune, success, failure, survival, or extinction. In my opinion, China will not necessarily lose or perish if a war breaks out. You don't have to be too pessimistic."</p>
<h3>Liu Hanfang in the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95</h3>
<p>— Zhu Shoukang</p>
<p>The Battle of Dadonggou was one of the fiercest battles between the Chinese and Japanese navies. Deng Shichang rammed his ship into the enemy and died heroically. Ding Ruchang retreated to Liugong Island, the base of the Beiyang Fleet, and ordered the torpedo squadron to lay mines in the harbor for defense. Cai Tinggan, the commander of the torpedo squadron, was a student who had studied in the United States and a new figure. Weihaiwei had two forts, facing each other north and south, commonly known as the North and South Gangs. The defender was Dai Zongjian. If the generals at that time could have sworn to defend against the enemy, firmly guarded the gates, and united to fight, how could they have suffered such a complete defeat? Unexpectedly, as soon as the enemy ships arrived, Cai Tinggan led the torpedoes to flee first, and the forts fell one after another. Ding Ruchang committed suicide, and the entire Beiyang Fleet fell into Japanese hands. Liu Hanfang, the customs commissioner of Donghai and the director of the Beiyang Naval and Land Camp Affairs, sought Cai Tinggan urgently. Cai sought refuge with foreigners in Yantai and was spared. According to legend, Liu Hanfang, courtesy name Xianglin, was from Anhui. He was discovered and promoted by Li Hongzhang, the Minister of Beiyang. He was known as "Blind Liu." Some people in Yantai who were dissatisfied with the Liu family wrote poems satirizing him, which were widely circulated for a time. One line said, "The Donghai Commissioner is blind." (The second line is forgotten.) The most peculiar nickname was "Liu Baba Dog," who changed his tail and called himself a son, bowing to the Beiyang. It can be said that both laughter and scolding were exhausted. However, Liu still fulfilled his duties as a scholar, not fearing death and not yielding. Hearing that the enemy army was approaching Yantai, he knew that the situation was over and sighed, "Since things have come to this, I can only repay the country with death." After speaking, he and his wife both put on official attire and sat in the hall, waiting for the arrival of the Japanese invaders, vowing not to surrender. Later, the consuls of various countries came out to stop the Japanese army, so they did not land. Although Liu did not die at that time, his ambition and his actions were truly shameful to those who are called "scholars guarding the borders" in this world today, who seek peace and fear death in the face of difficulties.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of Tianjin Amidst the Flames of War</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>My relative, the Master of Yi You Studio, has been living as a recluse in Tianjin for many years. This time, the Japanese invaders were rampant, and the flames of war raged. He looked towards Yan and Yun with concern for his old friends. He repeatedly sent letters to inquire about them. Now I have received his reply and learned a little about the recent situation. I feel relieved in my heart. I am now transcribing the reply below, which I believe will also be welcomed by those who are concerned about the situation in Tianjin. (Omitted above) A sudden and drastic change occurred here on the night of the eighth. The situation is extremely serious. The Hexi area (all concessions are in Hedong and Hexi) was greatly shocked. Many people died tragically. In the besieged battle lines, many people starved for three or four days. Fortunately, the Red Cross and Red Swastika Societies came out to provide relief, rescuing women and children for days and arranging for their resettlement. Hebei is the concentration of various institutions, so the defense is unusually tight. Fortunately, no unfortunate events have occurred. The situation has eased slightly in recent days, but the Japanese concession is still increasing troops and building fortifications, intensifying their work. I don't know what their intentions are. The future is dark and can still change at any time. This incident happened suddenly, and the people were not prepared. Therefore, the people in Hebei and other places did not have time to move. Residents of the Japanese concession were expelled by the Japanese and mostly moved to the French concession, because the Japanese concession is adjacent to the French concession. As for the various hotels, their profits have increased tenfold. Someone is temporarily remaining calm. Fortunately, he has a curfew pass from the municipal government, so he can still come and go freely. He plans to find a way to move out when the situation becomes critical, but he can only borrow from friends. There is no room to stay in hotels. Residents of the concession are renting out any small houses they can vacate at good prices. How unfortunate we are to live in this world of internal strife and foreign aggression. The sound of drums is startling, and it is not easy to survive. What else can be said? What else can be said? By the time this letter arrives, I don't know what the situation in Tianjin and Tanggu will be. (Omitted below) The Japanese aim to invade and plan to incite chaos. If our people do not rise up to deal with it immediately, I am afraid that the disaster will engulf the whole country, which is imminent. I am transcribing the master's letter with great emotion.</p>
<h3>Textual Research on the Complete Works of Mr. Shunsui</h3>
<p>— Zhu Bujun</p>
<p>I recently saw in the "Free Talk" section that my classmate Wang Junjieren called Japanese culture for the last two hundred years a period of burgeoning prosperity. This was due in large part to the teachings of the great Confucian scholar Zhu Shunsui of the late Ming Dynasty. He also expressed deep regret that Mr. Zhu harbored the ambition to restore the Ming Dynasty, but did not fulfill his wish to serve the country, and eventually withered away in a foreign land, with Chu talents being used by Jin. Now, according to Mr. Zhu, Mr. Wang Yangming, and Mr. Huang Lizhou, they are known as the three great scholars of my Yao. Their legacy is vast and evokes endless emotion. It seems appropriate for people to pass on their learning and for every family to possess their books. However, Yangming and Nanlei have already shone brightly and are revered. Only Mr. Zhu's books have not been widely disseminated, and few people know about them. The responsibility for continuing his extinct learning lies with future generations. His model is not far away, and admiration for him is growing. In the past, I saw Liang Rengong's work, "Shunsui Chronology," which was published in the "Beiping Practical Learning Magazine." Unfortunately, I regret that I have not seen the full manuscript. Now I will transcribe the versions of Mr. Shunsui's remaining books that have been mentioned in recent times, as follows. I hope that this will also be welcomed by those who admire Mr. Zhu. (1) "Collection of Zhu the Hermit" (Compiled by his disciple Kawamura Takehiko, revised and supplemented by Lord Kaga). (2) "Collected Works of Mr. Shunsui," twenty-eight volumes (Compiled by his disciple Lord Mito Tokugawa Mitsukuni, published in Kyoto in the fifth year of the Shotoku era in Japan). (3) "Complete Works of Shunsui" (Inaba Iwasho collated and published the Kaga and Mito editions, and also included "Mooring Boat Draft" recorded in Zhang Tingmai's "Yaojiang Poetry Collection"). (4) "Remaining Books of Shunsui" (Including twenty-five volumes of collected works, four volumes of miscellaneous writings. Tang Shouxian Zhexian of Shanyin deleted and revised the Inaba edition, and his son-in-law Ma Yifu wrote a preface for it. Published in the first year of the Republic of China. It is still available in bookstores today. Each set costs about four or five yuan. Unfortunately, because the printers at that time were eager to make profits, they did not proofread carefully, resulting in numerous errors and omissions in the content, which are difficult to sort out. It is being carefully revised.) (Moving to Solicit Aid for Disaster Relief)</p>
<h3>In Memory of Zhimo</h3>
<p>— Lin Shoutang</p>
<p>My painted eyebrows know that they are out of fashion, and I have always loved my grandson's poems most.</p>
<p>At the grave gate, the wind and rain rustle in the evening, and I begin to recognize the swaying poems of the white poplar.</p>
<h3>In Memory of Mr. Zhimo Who Died in a Plane Crash</h3>
<p>— Cheng Yansheng</p>
<p>How tragic is the will of Heaven, that this person should suffer such a disaster. His jade body was burned in mid-air, a painful loss; his zither strings were broken upon falling to the ground, a mournful sound. We glimpse his scales and claws in the new moon; we offer old wine to the winds and dust. (He edited the New Moon magazine and also had a collection titled "Scales and Claws of Paris") I heard you sing in the market of Yan as we parted; I can't bear to turn my head back in sorrow. (Before you returned south, I spent an evening listening to music with you in Beiping as we said goodbye, and I never saw you again)</p>
<h3>Attached: Proposal for Commemorating Zhimo</h3>
<p>Yang Xingfo's letter to Ge Gongzhen said: Zhimo's tragic death makes one feel that life is like a dream. In recent years, the tragic deaths of friends, such as Mingfu drowning while swimming, Yulu being shot in the middle of the night, and Zhimo encountering a disaster in flight, have become increasingly bizarre. The lives of people in troubled times are like weeds. Heaven should not be too generous to us, but it should not be so unkind. The newspaper reported that friends in Shanghai have set up a funeral committee. I don't know what the plan is. I think it is not appropriate to imitate the extravagance of great men. We should pay attention to permanent and meaningful memorials, such as choosing a scenic spot for the tomb and building a solid and beautiful structure, or establishing a new poetry prize or printing fund as a permanent memorial. The money doesn't need to be much, but it should be used appropriately and should be poetic. Xiangmei said that Zhimo's life was a wonderful new poem and his best creation. The funeral should not forget this point.</p>
<h3>Preface to Mr. Chen Xuanying's Sixtieth Birthday</h3>
<p>— Huang Jigang</p>
<p>Among the scholars of Siming, those who have established their words with brilliance since Vice Minister Ren, in the Song Dynasty there was Lou Ji, and in the Yuan Dynasty there were Yan Yuan Qingrong. Quan Zhaoshan called them "heroes of my Mao." As times changed, Zhaoshan replaced them with Zhan Yuan. More than two hundred years later, Mr. Xuanying, also a native of Zhan Yuan's county, appeared. In modern times, the orthodoxy of classical prose has been said to be Tongcheng. Those who followed its methods filled the world, mostly engaging in imitating sounds and filling in empty spaces, and limiting their boundaries to the Eight Great Masters and Gui Youguang. Those outside this, even if they became famous, were considered a separate school. How narrow! There was no lack of those who criticized it, but Mr. Chen's words were the most incisive. He condemned those who went lower as being like the actions of descendants and slaves, taking obedience as righteousness. He once said that prose must follow the supreme standard, but it should not be afraid of innovation. Innovation that suits the times is the source of standards. Obedience that does not suit the times is the reason why standards become obsolete. With Mr. Chen's theory, not only can the decline of the Tongcheng school be saved, but also those who belittle the ancients and indulge in bloodlust in recent times will not be allowed to break through and collapse without restraint. Then it is believed that Mr. Chen is the compass for those who discuss prose today. It is appropriate that he should be able to inherit from Xi Ming and almost surpass him. Several years ago, Kan first read Mr. Chen's edited "Dinghai County Gazetteer." I observed its compilation regulations and found that they were very different from the county books and geography books of the past. Liu Zixuan said that "it is rare to hear of love and strangeness when placed in other places," but this is not the case with Mr. Chen's book. In the past, local gazetteers focused on archaeology, but this gazetteer focuses on combining with the present. In the past, local gazetteers were either like account books in terms of quality, or they imitated historical biographies in terms of literature. This gazetteer has detailed tables and charts, and its arrangement is well-organized. It summarizes facts without being flashy or vulgar. In the past, local gazetteers were nothing more than transmitting old news from the countryside, but this gazetteer promotes the interests and disadvantages of the people's livelihood. If more than a thousand counties in the country all followed this example, it would not only be a reform of the system of local and national history, but also a lengthy compilation of our Chinese national history. Later generations who want to know the source of purity or turbidity, the customs and manners, and the fragrance and odor, will not take it from this, where will they take it from? This is its surpassing Zhang Yun, exceeding Chang Liu, emulating Ma Ban, and inheriting the lost edicts of Jiu Gong and carrying out the neglected classics of travel writers. This spring, Mr. Chen's younger brother Xun Ci showed Kan the "Tianying Studio Collection," and I was able to read the "Essays on Literary Propriety" and "Letters to Yu Yan," etc. Verifying this with Mr. Chen's gazetteer, I then knew that Mr. Chen's statement that "following the supreme standard but not being afraid of innovation" was actually something he was capable of doing. Therefore, he himself said that he could read the subtleties of Yu Gong's "Tribute of Yu" and "Officials of Zhou," and wash away the shortcomings of Chaoyi and Wugong. The world knows that this is not boasting. Literature and history have been separated for a long time. Literary scholars write one or two short articles that do not form a systematic outline, and historians are ignorant of the system and their diction is crude and difficult to fulfill the duties of recording. How rare is it that someone like Mr. Chen combines these abilities? Local gazetteers are either respected as history or treated as novels. From today's perspective, it is good to treat them as history. In the past, what Zhu Gan collected covered the nine provinces, and what Dou Si repaired exhausted the four countries. If there were no available classics at that time, then the beauty of Zhu Yu would not have been possible. It is known that local history is a part of national history, and the history of one place is the foundation of the history of the whole country. I personally lament that since the founding of the country, there have been internal and external troubles, and there has been no peace. Therefore, the work of writing has been neglected due to disturbances. When the "Draft History of the Qing Dynasty" first came out, I happened to browse it and found that it was too conservative and did not know how to change. It is not a true history for the Qing Dynasty, and it is a slanderous book for the new country. If we truly want to examine the events of the past two hundred years, we will be at a loss as to where to turn. If the country truly wants to leave behind indelible writings for posterity, it must gather elders with three strengths to engage in this, otherwise there will be no way to change the mistakes of the past. Someone like Mr. Chen, who can provide a standard for local history, can also create a model for national history. This is something that those in power should not forget. On December 8th, it will be Mr. Chen's sixtieth birthday. His disciple Tong Dide of Yin told Kan in advance, "You have long admired Mr. Xuanying. Why not say something on this occasion? It will both express your thoughts and entertain Mr. Chen." Kan is not talented and often uses literature and history to teach younger generations. I have not learned from the prose of Tongcheng, and I have nothing to criticize. I only often praise Mr. Chen's statement that "following the supreme standard but not being afraid of innovation." Although I cannot reach it, my heart yearns for it. Therefore, I follow Tongzi's words and write this article to express my deep admiration. As for elaborating on his life and making flattering praises, there are repeated terms of disgust and contempt in Mr. Chen's collection, and Kan dare not present them. September of the twentieth year of the Republic of China, Huang Kan of Qichun respectfully wrote.</p>

<h3>The Country Bumpkin Comes to Shanghai Again (35)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>At this moment, the country bumpkin was standing on the steps of someone's house, surrounded by many people. He seemed like a great party-state figure, guiding the masses, who were all listening to his orders. The country bumpkin said, "Those who oppose Ma Zhanshan should be overthrown!" Everyone shouted in unison, "Down with them! Down with the cold-blooded animals who oppose General Ma Zhanshan!"</p>
<p>Shouting slogans, everyone was really about to rush in. Fortunately, an old man inside came out to stop them. "Wait! Wait! What's the matter? We don't sell Japanese goods here."</p>
<p>"Despicable! Why do you oppose General Ma Zhanshan?" the crowd said angrily.</p>
<p>"We haven't opposed Ma Zhanshan," the old man said.</p>
<p>"You still say you haven't opposed him? Isn't it clearly written 'Anti-Occupy' on your electric light?"</p>
<p>"Haha! It's a misunderstanding! It's a misunderstanding! This is originally a large hotel. Large hotels in Shanghai are now generally called restaurants. The building has already been built, but we haven't decided what to call it yet. The electric light advertising company came to solicit business the other day, and we said, 'We haven't decided what restaurant to call it yet, so how can we make an electric light sign?' They said, 'Opening a restaurant is always a certainty. Let's make the words 'restaurant' first, and then add the name later.' We agreed to him. Who knew that after a few days, the 'food' radical of the 'restaurant' character wasn't lit, turning into an 'anti' character; the dot, stroke, and slash of the 'shop' character weren't lit either, leaving only the 'occupy' character. We really didn't intentionally oppose General Ma Zhanshan, and we ask you to forgive us."</p>
<p>Everyone heard this and realized it was indeed a misunderstanding. But the country bumpkin was also acting out of good intentions. Since they didn't intentionally oppose Ma Zhanshan, let it go.</p>
<p>It was getting late, and he was eager to go to Meilanfang to find his nephew A Mulinsen. By luck, he hired a rickshaw that knew Meilanfang in the French Concession and took him straight to Meilanfang, where he saw his nephew A Mulinsen.</p>
<p>"Uncle! I was worried about you. Why haven't you come yet, it's so late?"</p>
<p>"Eh! How did you know I was coming to Shanghai?"</p>
<p>"A quick letter from the countryside to Shanghai is here. Look at it."</p>
<p>The country bumpkin looked and saw that it was sent by the editorial department of the "Free Talk" section of the Shanghai Shen Bao, which wrote: "The Country Bumpkin Comes to Shanghai Again. Please end it as soon as possible. Because there are not many days left in the year, and another novel specially commissioned by our department is also limited to being published within the year, we have no choice but to notify you in advance."</p>
<p>The country bumpkin was very straightforward and said, "Okay! Since that's the case, I'll get out of here right away and go back to the countryside." (The End)</p>

<h3>Finance</h3>
<p>The Fearful Rise of the Gold Market</p>
<p>A drastic increase of twenty-two taels occurred. Yesterday and today, the gold market had a drastic reversal, and the rise intensified. It once broke through 710 taels, with only a few taels of consolidation. The daily high and low varied by as much as 28 or 29 taels. The sentiment among traders was extremely bullish, and the upward momentum was swift. As a result, it rose by about 22 taels. However, the silver market reported a rise, so it opened lower, and then gradually rose, with a prosperous trend. The progress was rapid, probably because large investors bravely resisted short selling and increased their positions on the long side, with great excitement. This was actually due to the weakening of British and strengthening of American foreign exchange rates. Due to the frequent drop in exchange rates, buyers flocked to cover their positions. The American exchange rate for British gold fell from more than 11 pence to within 10 pence 75, and the American gold rate only settled within 31 and a half yuan. Therefore, the price of gold soared by more than 20 taels. The market had slight differences later, and a new high price of 719 taels and 7 mace once appeared. Finally, it fell slightly, and it coincided with the lack of foreign exchange market on Wednesday, etc.</p>
<p>Rising Step by Step After Opening Low. It fell 3 taels and 7 mace immediately after opening early, to 691 taels, because large silver recovered 7/16 in the near term and 1/2 in the long term. The price of silver rose 1/8, and the private telegrams added 1/4. After that, the rise and fall did not spare, with a swing of three or four taels. Taitongchang initially came out after going in, followed by 95 taels. Zhifengyong, Yuancheng Yong, Tongchun, Hengchangyong, etc. came to sell, falling back to 91 taels. Probably the British gold loosened, and the banks did the mutual business of February 11 pence 125, and then absorbed the current month 25. Also, Meijin Zhejiang and He Lan issued March 32 yuan 125 to 1875, and soon retail investors bought in, rising again to 94 taels 2 mace. The internal seems to show a beautiful state of profits, and Chinese businessmen poured in. It is estimated that Meijin has retreated to within 32 yuan, and Shanghai, Huabi, and Maihang issued 32 yuan to 31 yuan 6875. The buying sentiment in the market is more than Heng. Hengyu, Hengxing, Dadecheng, Qianchangxiang, Zhifengyong, Yuankangxiang, Tongtaichang, Yuancheng Yong and other companies have entered the market, and the price has soared all the way, with more than 20 taels of odd. During this half hour, there was only a difference of one or two taels in the highest and lowest. The rate reached twelve taels at ten o'clock, and then fell back four taels, because Neixing, Yuda, Yifengyong, and Cuichangyong came to sell. At ten o'clock and a half, the rate was 0.7 taels and a half. Soon, Cuichangyong, Qianchangxiang, Dadecheng, Yuanmaoyong, Jingwai shang Qiaozhifu and other companies successively competed to purchase, and Meijin only settled 31 yuan and a half. HSBC absorbed British gold at 10 pence and 75, so the market felt more sharp. At eleven o'clock, the rate was 15 taels and a half. Then, with retail investors selling off in many ways, it was slightly less than three taels, and the rate was 12 taels at eleven and a quarter. Later, the wind rose and the clouds surged. Zhifengyong, Hengyu, Hengxing, Richang, Qianchangxiang and other companies continued to make tireless efforts. The Meijin was particularly tight, only settling 31 yuan 375 to half a yuan, and British gold was only 10 pence 6875. At noon, it reached 18 taels 5 mace, and then closed at 17 taels 8 mace. The bidding price was changed to 774 taels, and the pressing was 80 taels to 60 taels. This hedging was gradually drawn in, only accounting for about 40 taels.</p>
<p>A New High Price Appeared Before Closing. The market opened in the afternoon with a small one tael, which was 16 taels, because the Indian exchange rate reported a large twelve anna. And the goods opened low immediately, followed by 13 taels and 5, and then Dadecheng, Qianchangxiang and other companies bought in, and then rose to 17 taels. After a quarter past two, Yuanmaoshui, Hengchangyong, Wanxing and other companies sold out, and they cut down by two and a half taels, but there was no big change, until three o'clock it was 14 taels 5 mace. Suddenly, Zhifengyong, Dadecheng, Tongtaichang and the general retail investors on the table bought in, causing the price to rise sharply, and even raised to 19 taels 7 mace, a new high price. And at this time, the Bombay telegram was small and went to four anna. After half past three, there were two or three taels of disc rotation, but there were not many transactions, mostly sporadic. At ten minutes past four, it fell again to 16 taels, but the hedgers sold, and then added to 17 taels and 2 mace. By the time the market closed at 4:30, the rate was 16 taels 6 mace, a sharp increase of 21 taels and 9 mace compared to the previous day, and it was raised again to within 16 taels. According to the maximum of 719 taels and 7 mace throughout the day, the minimum was 691 taels, a difference of 28 taels and 7 mace. The price of goods in the early market was 91 taels, the afternoon price was 18 taels, the afternoon price was 15 taels, and the closing price was 15 and a half taels. The bidding price was estimated to be within 60 taels. The logging price was 14 taels in November and December, and 18 taels in January. The water was 14 taels, 13 taels in the afternoon, and the red line was estimated to be 5 taels and 25 plus.</p>
<p>The Transactions of Each Company Increased and Decreased. The transactions on the Tongmian surface were still smooth. According to statistics, Yuanmaoyong, Qianchangxiang, Dadecheng, Zhifengyong, Hengxing, Chengfeng Yongyuanxingyong, Hongkangyong, Tongtaichang, Hengyu, and Wu and Foreigner Qiaozhifu and other companies have all entered. Yongfeng, Fuchang, Fuyu, Futaiheng, Yuanchun, Yuantai, Shunli, Cuichangyong, and Yuandayong had frequent entrances and exits. Bingxing, Wanxing, Hengchangyong, Yifengyong, and Yuda all went out. In the afternoon, Tongtaichang, Qianchangxiang, Dadecheng, and Zhifengyong all entered more and exited less. Wanxing, Yuanmaoyong, Yuankangxiang, Hengxing, and Hengchangyong all exited. Yuantai, Senchangyong, Tongfu, Shunli, Fushun, and Yifengyong had occasional entries and exits, but the transactions of each company were not as strong as in the morning. The Dalian Gang had less than a thousand entries and exits, breaking even. The Guangdong Gang also exited one or two hundred articles and entered four or five hundred articles.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Market Weak Outside and Strong Inside</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the British, American, Indian, and Silver markets saw increases again, but the European market did not change much. However, the exchange rates of British and American currencies continued to decline. According to HSBC's quotation, the British gold was long three points (75), which was 1 shilling 10 and a half pence, and the American gold was only long three seven five, which was 31 yuan. Hong Kong was still 76 taels 6875, and the rest were changed to loosening. Probably the British gold actually opened by the bank, first loosened and then flattened. The result was also long 1875, but the US dollar was running in the opposite direction, because it was still squeezed with small exchange rates, so it shrank five or six one five in reverse. It was flat from the morning, and then tended to tighten, which is the different trend of Cheng Mingkuan's secret firmness. As for the gold market, it suddenly soared, and the short side made efforts to resist, and the big households competed to purchase, and it has already broken out of 710 taels. Then a new market was seen, so the hedging was drawn in. In the morning, it was 50 taels, then about 40 taels inside and outside, which was about ten taels closer than the previous day. The same industry as Wu, Chengfeng Yongrunchang, Yufuchang, and Guangdong gang are desperately trying to settle, and it is estimated that there are more than 2 million US dollars. There are occasional singles, not caring about the slips, but British gold is only about 100,000 pounds, mostly bank-to-bank trading. In the afternoon, due to Wednesday, there was no market as usual.</p>
<p>British exchange rate. The internal market has five six two five ups and downs. The loosest one is 1 shilling 11 pence 25, and the tightest is 10 pence 6875. The early offer is about 1 shilling 11 pence, and the purchase price is 11 pence 25. Mitsui and Zhejiang did the mutual business of March 125. Maihang entered this month 25. After that, Mitsui HSBC did the mutual business of April 10 pence 875. Sumitomo HSBC did the mutual business of 75, and March 8125. The noon closing offer was 6875 to 75, and the purchase price was increased by 0625.</p>
<p>American exchange rate. The internal market has eight seven five differences. The loosest price is 32 yuan 25, and the tightest price is 31 yuan 375. The early opening offer is 32 yuan, and the purchase price is 125. Anda Zhejiang issued January and February 125, Holland issued 1875, Shanghai Zhejiang issued 32 yuan, Huabi issued 31 yuan 875, Maihang issued January 9375, Zhengjin Maihang did the mutual business of March 6875, Maihang Zhejiang did the mutual business of March 625, Huabi issued 6875, HSBC issued the same price, East Asia Shanghai did the mutual business of 625, Shanghai issued 12. In February to 625 to half a yuan, Shanghai issued March 4375. The noon closing offer was 31 yuan 375 to half a yuan, and the purchase price was 31 yuan and a half to 625. One US dollar is equivalent to 3 taels 1 mace 2 fen 58 of silver.</p>
<h3>Large Silver Recovered Half a Penny</h3>
<p>Yesterday, according to the London telegram, the price of large silver turned upward, and the near term added 4375, which was 19 pence 25, and the long term also increased by half a penny, which was 19 pence and a half. Both China and India have purchased in their respective seats, but the transaction is rare, and the market is flat. After the market closed, the market was stable. There was not much activity in the United States. A telegram from New York was also received, and the price of American silver also increased slightly by 125. The spot price was 28 and a half cents. The British to the American currency was small, going to 1 and a half cents, which was 3 yuan 2 corner 9 fen 5. The American to the British currency fell 8 and three quarters of a cent, which was 3 yuan 3 corner 1 fen. The British Shanghai shilling increased by 1 penny, which was 1 shilling 11 pence. The Bombay spot added 14 anna, which was 61 rupees 02 anna, and the long term rose by 6 anna, which was estimated to be 61 rupees 04 anna.</p>
<h3>Gradual Recovery of Foreign Interest Rate Silver Speculation</h3>
<p>Market Overview After the various securities crises of last month were safely overcome without problems, the financial community's confidence gradually stabilized in the past two days, and the market showed a slight resurgence. The market prices of various interest rate speculations also gradually showed a positive trend. Silver speculation became looser, and foreign interest rates also tended to decline. However, the market remained sluggish and lacked any real impetus, mainly because the end of the year was approaching, and there was no need for expansion.</p>
<p>Interest Rate Speculation Prices (Foreign Interest Rate) The opening price in the morning was 7 qian, 2 fen, 4 li, and 5 hao, while the afternoon price was 7 qian, 2 fen, 3 li, and 5 hao, resulting in a decrease of 2 hao and 5 li compared to the previous day's opening price. (Silver Speculation) The opening price in the morning was 3 qian and 5 fen, while the afternoon price only opened at 3 qian, which was 1 qian less than the previous day. The bank's listed price also decreased by 2 fen, calculated as 1 qian and 4 fen. The interest rate discount was particularly loose, with only 5 or 6 fen made yesterday.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market The morning and afternoon prices of Jiangnan small foreign coins were both 6 qian, 4 fen, and 7 li. The transaction volume was 3,000 jiao in the morning and 3,500 jiao in the afternoon. The morning and afternoon prices of Guangdong small foreign coins were also both 6 qian, 5 fen, and 2 li. The transaction volume was 135,000 jiao in the morning and 35,000 jiao in the afternoon. Copper coins were revised to 500 wen each, totaling 379,000 wen.</p>
<p>Silver and Foreign Currency Inflow and Outflow (Silver) Yesterday, the bank received remittances totaling 1.89 million for Chinese merchants' remittance tickets, over 2.2 million for foreign merchants' remittance tickets, over 3 million for special remittances, and 7.34 million for various cargo exchange taxes and miscellaneous remittances. The outflow from the warehouse was 1.5 million. The silver public bills received by money shops totaled over 41.1 million, the interest rate discount remittances totaled over 3.4 million, various remittance routes totaled over 700,000, and cash receipts exceeded 1 million. (Foreign Currency) Remittance ticket sales were 1.32 million in the morning and 930,000 in the afternoon. Banknote sales were 50,000 in the morning and 25,000 in the afternoon. Off-exchange banknote sales were 135,000 in the morning and 70,000 in the afternoon. Bank transactions were 600,000 for interbank trading in the morning and 400,000 for interbank trading in the afternoon. Foreign currency receipts and payments between various bank accounts exceeded 1.5 million, foreign currency interest rate discount remittances exceeded 1.7 million, foreign currency borrowing inflows and outflows exceeded 1.6 million, and small coin transactions exceeded 440,000. Over 200,000 silver dollars were shipped to the north. The customs, under orders to prohibit it, refused to declare the shipment, but after the forwarding agent provided proof from the silver and money industries and the customs broker association that it was not being used by the Japanese, it was allowed to proceed.</p>
<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>The Government Bond Market Is Very Quiet</p>
<p>Trading Volume Greatly Reduced After Restrictions</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 2nd), the situation in the various bond markets of the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange showed active spot trading, with a total turnover of 29,000 yuan in the morning and 15,000 yuan in the afternoon, totaling 44,000 yuan. The futures market was relatively quiet, with the total trading volume for buying treasures throughout the day being very quiet. The opening price in the morning was 2.7 million, and the subsequent market was only over 700,000 yuan, totaling only 2.985 million yuan. This was because the trading volume of each bond was mostly only several hundred thousand. Regarding the changes in the prices of various bonds, the market sentiment was still good in the early morning session. Due to restrictions on sellers, preventing them from selling freely, buyers still had the upper hand in the market. Small purchases continued to be active, and prices continued to rise significantly. For example, the 20 Customs rose to 2 yuan, and other bonds also rose by about 1 yuan each. In the second session, the price recovered slightly due to the scarcity of purchases, and the subsequent trend revolved without significant fluctuations. As a result, futures such as the 20 Customs rolled contract rose by about 1 yuan, and the rest rose by about half a yuan. Disbandment 96 remained unchanged. The spot 20 Customs consolidated tax also rose significantly, while disbandment rose by as much as 8 yuan compared to last week. Only the spot 20 rolled contract of Wenyi was slightly weak. Observing the bond market situation, although the current diplomatic situation offers little hope for a turnaround, the various bonds that are due to be repaid with principal and interest are currently being fulfilled as scheduled, the people's hearts are stable, and the overall situation is still optimistic. In addition, due to the exchange's restrictions on new sales in recent days, the trading volume has been greatly reduced, and investors mostly feel inconvenienced. The current bond prices have turned firm, and it is hoped that the restrictions may be abolished soon.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>Yarn Market Trending Higher</p>
<p>The yarn market is very firm and the upward trend is quite strong. This is because many retail investors who were previously pessimistic about the situation sold off a large amount of their holdings, which were mostly absorbed by manufacturers. Now that the news is slightly better, a rebound has suddenly occurred. As a result, the buying power of retail investors has become increasingly strong. However, actual demand remains flat. In short, the underlying goods are not strong, making it easy for prices to rise.</p>
<p>Man Biao Rises by Two or Three Taels In the pre-market opening of Man Biao, although American cotton fell, there were many buyers in the market, causing the market sentiment to be quite tight. Prices for each month rose by 1 tael and 89 qian to 2 taels and 5 qian. In the afternoon, the near months remained firm and rose another 7 or 8 qian, while the far months fell by 1 or 2 qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 48,400 bales. A survey found that Taixing sold 4,850 bales, Mingde sold 1,450 bales, Gengfeng sold 1,050 bales, and Yuantai sold 1,050 bales. Hengde bought 1,350 bales, Xincheng bought 1,050 bales, and Xiesheng bought 900 bales. The closing prices are listed on the left:</p>

<h3>New Bulls Swarm in the Cotton Market</h3>
<p>The cotton market is experiencing a dramatic rise, with the price of gold soaring and Indian cotton trending higher, causing panic among scattered short sellers. There is a lack of sellers in the market, and the number of new bulls is increasing daily, making the upward trend increasingly tight. However, actual demand remains bleak, and factories are not active. In reality, the market is still flat. Generally speaking, there are too many short sellers, causing a particularly strong rebound.</p>
<p>Han Biao Rises by 4 Qian The pre-market opening of Han Biao saw a decrease in buyers due to the fall in American cotton and the sharp rise in Indian cotton. Prices for each month rose by 4 or 5 qian. In the afternoon, each month fell slightly by 1 or 2 qian. A survey found that Gengfeng sold 11,200 dan, Yifeng sold 2,500 dan, Gongtai sold 3,800 dan, Taixing sold 2,600 dan, and Tianlong sold 2,600 dan.

<h3>The Reason for the Renewed Weakness of American Cotton</h3>
<p>Few Buyers... Wall Street Selling</p>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton initially weakened due to a lack of major buyers and selling on Wall Street. Later, it rebounded slightly due to some short covering. Futures fell by 7 to 12 points, and spot prices fell by 10 points. British cotton futures fell by 1 point, while spot prices rose by 23 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 30 points. The Indian cotton market was firm, with Pingguoer and Bailuoxi rising by 7.5 rupees, and Aomula rising by 10 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram from the 1st):</p>

<h3>Anti-Japanese Association Cables the Ministry of Foreign Affairs</h3>
<p>Opposing Direct Sino-Japanese Negotiations</p>
<p>The Anti-Japanese Association, due to the trend of direct Sino-Japanese negotiations, yesterday sent a special cable to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, expressing the essence of the public's opposition. The text reads, "To Minister Gu of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing, the negotiations with Japan have suddenly changed. According to repeated reports, the US government has a firm belief that the solution to the Manchurian problem lies in direct Sino-Japanese negotiations. There are now reports that both sides are acting more gently, and that the Japanese ambassador, Shigemi, has gone to the capital to discuss the Jinzhou and Tianjin issues. There are also reports that Japanese diplomats in the north have been in contact with the local authorities. If this is true, it is extremely shocking. Since the occurrence of the Northeast Incident, the people of our country have been weeping and groaning, running around to inform each other. Our League of Nations representative has made painstaking efforts to compromise and mediate. The soldiers of our Heilongjiang Province have fought bravely and selflessly in the icy and snowy fields. What they have insisted on and sought is nothing more than opposing direct negotiations, fearing that they will repeat the past mistakes, and that local officials or the government will, under the coercion and inducement of the tyrannical Japanese, sign treaties that will once again lose their rights and humiliate the country. You, sir, have taken office in times of crisis, and perhaps you have said that after taking office, you will be able to open up a new situation. How could you have just taken office and heard of direct negotiations, and heard that Japanese diplomats have been in contact with the northern authorities, and then verified by reports that our government has instructed Ambassador Shi to agree to the proposal for a neutral zone in Jinzhou. The profundity of this is truly beyond the comprehension of the shallow and ignorant people. In short, at this time, our country does not recognize direct negotiations. Although the tyrannical Japanese are barbaric, they may not be able to destroy our entire country immediately, and under international supervision, even if the tyrannical Japanese have unreasonable demands, they may not be able to blatantly export them. This is the essence of the opposition to direct Sino-Japanese negotiations that our entire country's people adhere to, and we do not hesitate to repeat it to you, sir. Alas, the country is a people's group, and the people must personally suffer the loss of the country. The benefits and losses are not counted in a moment, and the merits and demerits have their own millennium. Please do not ignore the trend of public opinion. A special telegram is sent to you, waiting for orders. Sincerely, the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association."</p>
<h3>Opposing the Establishment of a Neutral Zone</h3>
<p>Important Telegrams from Various Organizations</p>
<p>The Youth Association Member Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association yesterday sent a telegram to Chairman Jiang, which reads, "To Chairman Jiang of the Nanjing National Government, reports that our country has proposed in the League of Nations to cede land as a neutral zone, and acknowledged the expression of withdrawing the National Army into the customs. Such measures are completely contrary to your initial advocacy of not withdrawing troops or opening talks, and the determination to personally deal with the Japanese bandits in the north, and the spiritual and material sacrifices of the people for seventy years have also been equal to virtual waste. Your loyalty, bravery, and love of country should be able to see the advantages and disadvantages. Also, Zhang Xueliang is currently in Tianjin, and ordered the National Army to make concessions, and also held meetings with Japanese Counselor Yano on the Dong Province incident. Zhang has already become a criminal against the country. If the government values the country, it should follow public opinion and immediately cancel the proposal for a neutral zone, and order the punishment of Zhang Xueliang to demonstrate the model. Still based on your original intention, use force for self-defense to achieve the goal of withdrawing troops, opening talks, and restoring the homeland. Your loyalty and diligence to the country, the people swear to support you to the death. It is hoped that you will eliminate traitors and maintain the overall situation. Sincerely, the Shanghai Youth Association Member Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association." The Telegram from the Unemployed Soldiers Association reads, "All newspapers, agencies, and public groups are informed that since the loss of Dong Province, the Japanese slaves have become increasingly rampant, and the suffering of the compatriots has become increasingly deep. Except for Ma Zhanshan's lack of support, the Liaoning and Jilin armies have never once thought of restoring the land. Recently, they have felt that the alliance under the city is insufficient, and asked the League of Nations to set up a neutral zone to cut off the territory east of Jinzhou. Tracing back to the fall of Liaoning, the British diplomatic authorities declared that the abolition of consular jurisdiction should be postponed. It can be seen that all countries treat China with the Japanese as a shift. Now, the division of a neutral zone is not in the Sino-Japanese border area, but in our country's Jinzhou. How is this different from international co-management? How is it different from the great powers dividing up? According to today's newspaper, a telegram from Paris said that Foreign Minister Gu's intention is only to have Japan sign an agreement not to offend each other in the neutral zone. If this information is accurate, then which country's troops will be stationed east of Jinzhou, and which country will manage it? Does our central government not care about the three provinces and 30 million people, or is there another role? This is truly what we are greatly perplexed and do not understand. How can a magnificent China, with a civilization of thousands of years of history, allow others to slaughter and self-destruct? It is hoped that all compatriots in the country will rise up together, urge the government to adhere to the withdrawal of troops, make diplomatic claims, and prepare domestically to recover the soldiers' land. The telegram is sent in a hurry, waiting for a response. Sincerely, the Republic of China Unemployed Soldiers Association."</p>
<p>Also, the Sichuan Fellow Association and the Chaozhou Fellow Association also have circular telegrams, the texts of which are omitted.</p>
<h3>Effectiveness of Boycotting Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>Customs Duties Have Now Increased by 2 Million Yuan</p>
<p>The Export of Domestically Produced Goods is Becoming More and More Popular</p>
<p>Japanese Commerce Has Now Fallen to Fifth Place</p>
<p>Since the Shenyang Incident, the tyrannical Japanese forcibly occupied the Northeast. Since the people of the entire country have uniformly carried out a boycott of enemy goods, the Japanese merchants in Shanghai have been greatly panicked, and have stopped loading goods to China one after another. Japan's entire market in China has also fallen from first place to fifth place. Taking advantage of this opportunity, the countries of Europe and America are doing everything possible to compete in business in China, thinking about seizing Japan's position in China and replacing it. According to reliable information from the Shanghai Customs yesterday, the total amount of goods transported to China by European and American countries has exceeded the previous import in the past two months, reaching several million yuan per month. As for domestically produced goods, due to the efforts of overseas Chinese and the willingness of domestic compatriots to purchase them, sales have increased sharply, and those who declare customs and transport exports are becoming more and more popular. As of yesterday, according to accurate statistics from the customs, compared with before the boycott of Japanese goods, customs duties have increased by more than 2 million yuan. Domestically produced goods account for seven or eight tenths of the total increase in customs duties. Although Japanese goods have not been completely eliminated, the phenomenon of their decline has created a new record since the boycott of enemy goods began. Customs officials said, "If the people of our entire country can continue to firmly maintain the boycott for another month, then the Japanese goods stored in our country will be completely eliminated, and their commerce in China will be permanently in a state of decline."

<h3>Local Rumors Gradually Subside</h3>
<p>Martial Law Suspended Yesterday</p>
<p>Winter Security Measures Quite Stringent</p>
<p>Authorities in Chinese Concession Pay Attention to Japanese Convention</p>
<p>Due to rumors of Japanese "ronin" intending to disrupt the peace, local military and police authorities declared special martial law on the 29th to maintain public order. Traffic was cut off and pedestrians forbidden after 12 midnight. All military and police forces were fully armed and deployed. As the rumors have gradually subsided, martial law was lifted yesterday. However, as the end of the year approaches, during the winter security period, all districts, branch offices, and police stations under the City Public Security Bureau have, since yesterday, assigned armed double patrols to each post day and night. The police brigade and mobile patrol teams continue to patrol armed. All members of the City Defense Corps, led by their captains, are conducting armed patrols. Armed soldiers are also still stationed as sentries near various garrisons. Furthermore, from the 6th to the 8th of this month, a convention of all Japanese residents in China will be held in Shanghai, at the Japanese school next to the fire station in Shenjiawan, Hongkou. The authorities in the Chinese concession are paying close attention.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Assembly Dispute Resolved</h3>
<p>Central Committee Members Elected Yesterday</p>
<p>Sun and Hu Will Soon Come to Shanghai</p>
<p>The Fourth National Congress of the Kuomintang in Guangdong previously raised objections to the Shanghai peace conference resolution, creating a tense situation. Subsequently, Hu Hanmin, in Hong Kong, and Wang Jingwei, in Shanghai, exchanged telegrams to find remedial measures. With some indication from the Beijing authorities, the Guangdong Fourth National Congress reached a compromise under this understanding, and the situation took a sudden turn for the better. The Guangdong Fourth National Congress elected Central Committee members based on the three proposals of Mr. Hu as reported yesterday. Mr. Wang received a telegram from Guangdong yesterday reporting that the Guangdong Fourth National Congress had elected Central Committee members yesterday, and the congress is scheduled to close today. Regarding the issue of the new 12 million yuan government bonds issued by Beijing, Mr. Wang had previously written to the banking and financial industries associations, stating that the new government bonds could not be recognized before the establishment of a unified government. Now, under the same understanding, the Guangdong side no longer opposes the new government bonds.</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that according to a telegram from Mr. Hu, he does not wish to go to Guangzhou to attend the meeting. He has decided to stay in Hong Kong and wait for the Guangdong side to elect the new Fourth National Congress Central Committee members, after which he will come to Shanghai with Sun Ke, Li Wenfan, Wu Chaochu, and Chen Youren. They are expected to arrive in Shanghai within this week. As for the opening of the first plenary session of the Fourth National Congress Central Committee, according to key figures in Shanghai from Beijing, now that the Guangdong congress dispute has been resolved, the opening date of the first session of the Fourth National Congress Central Committee should not be far off. It is generally believed that this matter will proceed after Sun and Hu arrive in Shanghai and the two sides consult. The venue will naturally be in Nanjing. When the meeting is held in the future, a new unified government will be established based on the peace conference resolutions.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Assembly</h3>
<p>Delegates Who Withdrew Arrive in Shanghai</p>
<p>Totaling More Than One Hundred and Sixty People</p>
<p>Previously, at the Fourth National Congress of the Kuomintang in Guangdong, some delegates opposed various points of the Peace Preparatory Conference resolution, leading to some delegates withdrawing and going to Hong Kong, totaling more than one hundred and sixty people. Among the delegates who withdrew, Jiangsu Province delegate Wang Maogong, Zhejiang Province delegate Zhou Xinwei, Fujian Province delegate Zeng Zhongming, Nanjing City delegate Liang Hancao, and more than one hundred and twenty others have arrived in Shanghai in batches over the past two days. They have visited Wang Jingwei's residence on Rue Petain, requesting an audience to personally report the circumstances of their withdrawal. As the number of people is too large, Wang intends to ask them to elect representatives within a few days for a meeting.</p>
<h3>Wang Jingwei's Talk</h3>
<p>Delegates Remaining in Hong Kong Can Return to Guangzhou Immediately</p>
<p>After the mediation of Hu Zhantang and Wu Chaochu at the Guangdong Fourth National Congress, the delegates who opposed the resolution have agreed to accept it, and the obstacles to mediation have been eliminated. Yesterday, reporters from various news agencies asked Mr. Wang Jingwei about the fact that some delegates, such as Wang Faqin, Guo Chuntao, and Zhao Wailian, had already returned to Shanghai on the 27th of last month, and what would be done about it. Mr. Wang's response was as follows: Reporter: How will you deal with the delegates who withdrew from the Guangdong Assembly? Wang: Delegates are now arriving in Shanghai one after another. Some are still in Hong Kong, and they may go to Guangzhou immediately. Those who come to Shanghai can also express their opinions. (Question) What are the advantages and disadvantages of establishing a neutral zone in Jinzhou for our country? (Answer) I have not received a notice from the Nanjing Special Foreign Affairs Committee, so I do not know the details and it is difficult to speculate.

<h3>Extremely Important</h3>

<p>Totaling Five Items</p>

It is reported that the above five conditions were put forward to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by Shigemitsu Mamoru.</p>
<h3>Export of Silver Dollars</h3>
<p>Shanghai Banking and Financial Industries Responsible for Proof</p>
<p>Guaranteeing No Re-Export After Arrival at Destination</p>
<p>Suggestions from Tianjin Chamber of Commerce and Banking and Financial Industries</p>
<p>Since the Jianghai Customs, under the order of the Ministry of Finance, prohibited the export of silver dollars, ordinary merchants have been unable to use their tricks. However, the various ports that need silver to maintain the local economy cannot avoid panic. Therefore, the banking and financial industries association and the customs brokers association unanimously discussed ways to load silver dollars. It is now heard that the three associations have submitted letters of certification, stating that the export of silver dollars to Tianjin, Beijing, Yingkou, Qingdao, and Yantai is for the purpose of adjusting the market and is not intended to be resold to the Japanese. If there is any use of the silver dollars by the Japanese after they are loaded to these places, they are willing to take full responsibility and guarantee it. They also request the Jianghai Customs to continue to release the silver dollars unimpeded. They also intend to submit another report to the Ministry of Finance, detailing the trade situation and its advantages and disadvantages as much as possible. As for merchants seeking profits by smuggling, various industries have formed anti-Japanese national salvation groups and dispatched inspectors to prevent it at any time, and there will be no abuses.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Banking and Financial Industries Association received telegrams from the Tianjin Chamber of Commerce and the Banking and Financial Industries Association, suggesting alternative methods for exporting silver dollars. Leaders of the Shanghai banking and financial industries also believe that this method is very appropriate and can be adopted as soon as they consult. The Tianjin telegram is recorded below: To the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Banking Association, and Financial Industries Association: Reports indicate that a large number of silver dollars have recently been transported from Shanghai to Dalian, Qingdao, Yantai, etc. In order to prevent foreigners from absorbing them and to maintain domestic finance, it is proposed to take measures to ban them or request the government to order a temporary ban on the export of silver dollars. We deeply admire your detailed plans and thoughtfulness. However, we believe that Shanghai is the financial center of the country, and the Tianjin market is also centered on Shanghai. There have been no restrictions on the exchange and transportation of silver dollars in the past. In normal times, merchants and firms withdraw deposits, or when the silver price rises sharply, they temporarily transfer them to stabilize the market, especially relying on Shanghai as the source. Once interrupted, panic will arise. Especially in times of turbulence, inspection and vigilance should be strengthened and leakage should be strictly prevented. The whole country should assist in this, and Tianjin also expresses its sympathy. In order to stabilize the finance of the two places, during this special period, when banks and firms transfer funds from Shanghai to Tianjin, the firm or bank can request certification from your association in Shanghai or negotiate with our association in Tianjin before loading and transporting. This seems to be more practical and beneficial than issuing a ban on transportation, because it still contains the intention of restraint in the process of maintenance. We humbly offer our views for your consideration and look forward to your telegram. Tianjin Chamber of Commerce, Banking and Financial Industries Association.</p>
<h3>Order Prohibiting Grain Exports</h3>
<p>Municipal Government Orders Social Affairs Bureau</p>
<p>To Instruct the Rice Industry to Investigate and Handle</p>
<p>The Municipal Government yesterday approved the internal memorandum of the Ministry of Interior, which forwarded an order from the Executive Yuan stating that the Yuan had repeatedly issued orders to investigate and prohibit the smuggling of grain exports. This year's floods have been severe, and the autumn harvest has failed, so the previous ban should be reiterated to maintain food supplies. The memorandum was approved and forwarded to the Ministry to be followed and forwarded to the provincial and municipal governments to strictly investigate and prohibit this. It is heard that the Municipal Government has ordered the Social Affairs Bureau to instruct the Grain Commission and the various rice industry associations to investigate and handle this matter.</p>
<h3>Telegram Correspondence of Remittances to Ma Zhanshan</h3>
<p>Jiang Chunhui Tang Telegraphed Chairman Ma, "Admired General Ma Zhanshan, Hailun. Your Excellency's lone army defending the country and resisting the violent Japanese has brought glory to the nation, but as ammunition runs out and reinforcements are cut off, all citizens are filled with grief and indignation. We cannot follow with arms and horses, so we dare to do our utmost to gather 5,000 yuan from family and friends, and entrust the Bank of China to remit it as a humble offering, to fulfill the duty of the common man. We hope Your Excellency will value the country and await good news. We pray earnestly. Jiang Chunhui Tang, Shanghai."</p>
<p>Ma Zhanshan replied to Jiang Chunhui Tang by telegram, "Shanghai Nanyang Road No. 40, Shanghai Jiang Chunhui Tang, all sirs, Greetings. I have received the telegram and thank you for your praise and generous gift. The officers and men of the three armies express their gratitude. The government has now moved to Hailun, and a person has been sent to Harbin to arrange for the transfer of the funds. Ma Zhanshan, Greetings, respectfully."</p>
<p>The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of Fudan Experimental Middle School launched a fundraising campaign some time ago. Yesterday, it held a general meeting and opened the donation box in public. A total of more than 2,000 yuan was donated. The association has remitted the funds to Hailun, and its telegram to General Ma Zhanshan said, "We have remitted 2,043 yuan, 2 jiao, and 9 fen. We hope you will work hard to kill the enemy and restore our country." The students of the school expressed their gratitude to those who generously donated this time.</p>
<p>The Huzhou Shanghai Primary and Secondary Schools received a reply telegram from Chairman Ma from Hailun yesterday, which said, "Huzhou Shanghai Primary and Secondary Schools, Greetings. I have received the telegram and thank you for your praise and generous gift. I am ashamed and grateful. On behalf of my officers and men, I extend my sincere gratitude. Ma Zhanshan, 30th day, printed."</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>Advocates Boycott of Fushun Coal</p>
<p>The Mine is One of the Affiliated Enterprises of South Manchuria</p>
<p>The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce believes that the Fushun Coal Mine is run by the Japanese and should be boycotted, so it has sent letters and telegrams to express this separately. The following is a transcript:</p>
<p>A telegram from the Donghai County Grain Industry Association, "To the City Chamber of Commerce, Greetings. Your port's Anti-Japanese Association has issued a list of Japanese goods, stating that Fushun Coal is a domestic product. Should it be boycotted? Please reply quickly. Donghai County Grain Industry Association."</p>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce replied to the Grain Industry Association by telegram, "To the Donghai Grain Industry Association via the Xinpu Telegraph Bureau, Greetings. We received the telegram. The Fushun Coal Mine is an affiliated enterprise of the South Manchuria Railway and is run by the Japanese. It should be boycotted. We have sent another letter to the Anti-Japanese Association requesting that it be corrected. Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce."</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese from Nanyang Return to the Country to Join the Army</h3>
<p>Korean Cai Zidong Not Admitted Without Guarantee</p>
<p>In recent days, overseas Chinese and Korean people from various places in Nanyang, in view of the atrocities and inhumanity of the violent Japanese, have been filled with righteous indignation and have returned to the country one after another to join the army and resist the Japanese pirates. The day before yesterday, a Korean named Cai Zidong came to Shanghai from Taiwan to register with the Ximen Volunteer Army Committee in order to enlist. However, although Mr. Cai's enthusiasm was commendable, he did not have a letter of introduction from the local authorities, nor a guarantee from a Shanghai organization. For the sake of prudence, he was politely declined. Yesterday morning, Fu Weikun, an overseas Chinese from the Zhonghua School in Cebu, Philippines, Nanyang, also came to Shanghai on a special Nanyang ship and was introduced and guaranteed by Qian Wanqing, a customs officer of the Jianghai Customs. He registered with the association to enlist. After the association reviewed his case, it was deemed acceptable and he has been assigned to a team for training.</p>
<h3>Southeast Medical College</h3>
<p>Latest News on the Arrival of the Rescue Team in Heilongjiang near Ping</p>
<p>The Southeast Medical College Rescue Team departed from Shanghai on the 19th and went north via Nanjing. On the 22nd, it arrived in Tianjin. On the way, it met the chairman of the Guangming Middle School in the port, who expressed great sympathy for the team's patriotic enthusiasm and volunteered to donate a large number of medicines and equipment that he had stored. However, after arriving in Tianjin, because the medicines were stored in a restricted area, after repeated attempts to retrieve them, the medicines and equipment had been sold by their custodian, to great disappointment. On the 23rd, they arrived in Ping, where they were received by the Law School and temporarily stayed in the school. However, the team's mission is to go to Heilongjiang to rescue and protect the soldiers who are resisting the enemy for the country. However, their finances are exhausted. To realize their work, they rely on the sympathy and assistance of all sectors of society. Otherwise, they will only have the heart to serve the country, but no possibility of realizing it. Therefore, after arriving in Ping, they contacted various parties separately and sent telegrams to various sectors of society in Nanjing and Shanghai for assistance. In the past few days, although they have been warmly welcomed and received by all sectors of Ping, there are very few who can actually provide assistance. However, there has been no news of powerful people from Nanjing and Shanghai supporting them, so the entire team is extremely sad. However, they are determined to shed blood in the Northeast to the death and will never return to the Southeast empty-handed. In this desperate situation, they petitioned Vice Commander Zhang for five points: (1) Instructions on the route, (2) Protection along the way to avoid unnecessary sacrifices, (3) Provision of sanitary materials, (4) Provision of winter clothing, (5) Subsidies. On the 26th, Vice Commander Zhang met them and expressed his sincerity in accepting the petition. Regarding the first point, he stated that the distance between Heilongjiang Province and Ping is several hundred miles, and the railway is no longer open. The waterway also passes through Russian territory, and it is feared that it will be difficult to issue a passport. As for taking a detour through Inner Mongolia, it will take several months to reach, and the military situation is unknown. Moreover, during this severe winter, the climate outside the customs is extremely cold, with snow and ice connecting the sky and wilderness stretching for thousands of miles. There are few travelers and the road is endless. Although they have great determination, in fact, they will only make unnecessary sacrifices. However, the team has resolved to live and die with the soldiers in the front and vowed not to return empty-handed. Vice Commander Zhang, moved by the team's enthusiasm, ordered them to stay in Ping temporarily and prepare everything. He will explore the route and, if there is a battle in the front, send them to work locally to fulfill their purpose of sacrificing for the country. The team believes that their goal is not just for Ma Zhanshan personally, but as long as they are soldiers who are resisting the enemy for the country, they can fulfill their responsibilities of rescue and protection. They accepted the Vice Commander's opinion and have moved into the Vice Commander's headquarters and are making preparations. They are now receiving military training and battlefield hygiene duties every day to be ready to set off. Although the team failed to advance as scheduled, it has awakened the public.</p>
<h3>The Public Diplomacy Support Association Emphatically States</h3>
<p>Telegraph Request to Punish Zhang Xueliang and Resist Japan</p>
<p>Oppose Dividing Jinzhou into a Neutral Zone</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>Hua Dong News Agency reports that the Public Diplomacy Support Association telegraphed the Central Government and the Guangdong Government yesterday to oppose the division of Jinzhou into a neutral zone and to request resistance against Japan.</p>
<p>Telegraph to the National Government, "Japanese imperialism has occupied the three northeastern provinces for more than two months. The government has no definite policy on this, and the people across the country are disappointed. At the time of the establishment of this association, after a general resolution, we respectfully submit three matters as follows. When national disasters occur, the government has no self-defense preparations and begs for help from the League of Nations. The League of Nations is a division of spoils by imperialists for weak nations, and it is impossible to help China. This is inevitable. The three League of Nations meetings have shown no ability or sincerity to judge the Japanese atrocities, which is enough to expose its true face. The government should immediately order Shi Zhaoji to withdraw from the League of Nations and engage in self-defense work, without participating in it and merely lending support to the imperialists. This is the first. The way to build a country is to be able to defend itself. Premier Sun Yat-sen took down imperialism to inspire the whole country. Today, when faced with foreign aggression, first it is said, 'Be calm,' and then it is said, 'Do not resist,' getting worse and worse, without any revitalization. If this continues, the country will perish without a day. We request that you embrace the determination to make the greatest sacrifices, send troops to fight Japan, win the war, and the problems in the eastern provinces can be solved easily. If we are unfortunately defeated, we can also revitalize the morale and fight to the end. Now, we are neither dead nor alive, and we are being slaughtered at will. Not only is the loss of the country worrying, but it is also extremely shameful. Today, Commander Zhang Fakui is willing to lead the Iron Army to kill the enemy. His loyalty and righteousness have inspired the whole country. Please provide him with convenience and assistance so that he can complete his great wish of resisting Japan and saving the country. This is the second. Zhang Xueliang, as the governor of the border province, has 200,000 troops and is responsible for defending the territory. How should he sacrifice himself to save the country? However, when the Japanese invaded, he adopted a policy of non-resistance, and lost three provinces in a few days. How can his crime of misleading the country be avoided? The government should issue an order to dismiss him from his post and investigate him in order to warn against recklessness and prevent imitation. This is the third. Since the outbreak of the national disaster, the government has not taken any measures to satisfy the people. The above three are the consistent demands of the people at present. We urge you to issue clear orders immediately to appease the people."</p>
<p>Oppose Neutral Zone, "To the Public Across the Country, Since our Liaoning and Jilin provinces have been occupied by Japan, more than two months have passed. The unreasonableness of the Japanese has been made clear to all countries. The facts are clear and the responsibility has been clearly defined. Our country should have immediately implemented military action to recover the territory and protect its sovereignty in order to rescue the people of the Northeast from the waters and save the entire nation from danger, as Japan twice agreed to withdraw its troops in accordance with the national agreement on October 13 and November 16. The government did not do this, and instead relied on the League of Nations to solve the problem. The government is willing to accept any resolution of the League of Nations. If the League of Nations resolves to hand over all of our country's military and political powers to the League of Nations Council for management, will the government accept it all? Now, it is even more absurd. Our representative Shi Zhaoji has proposed to the League of Nations to divide Jinzhou into a neutral zone, with troops stationed by neutral countries. Is Jinzhou our territory? Should the people of Jinzhou be protected by our government? Has the government lost the power to protect its own territory and has it lost the power to maintain the safety of its own people? In international practice, it may be possible for a neutral country to send troops to be stationed temporarily in the border area between two countries to avoid conflict and war. However, the situation in the Northeast is completely different. Liaoning and Jilin belong to our territory, and the Japanese army occupied them by force. Japan should be held responsible for undermining peace. If Japan does not withdraw its troops, the League of Nations should immediately impose severe sanctions on Japan. As for Jinzhou, which is deep inland, it cannot be compared with the border. Why should it be designated as neutral? If Japan attacks Tianjin, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Hankou, and even Nanjing with artillery fire, will these places also be designated as neutral zones and troops will be stationed by so-called neutral countries? The League of Nations' prestige is shattered by its weakness and bullying in the current Northeast incident, and it has exposed its collapse. Therefore, it is turning to suppress our country and fuel the flames of the Japanese, so as to prolong its life. Our government is not only not withdrawing from the League of Nations to seek self-defense and self-rescue, but also making this reckless proposal, which not only loses power and benefits, but also contains the crisis of joint management. The survival of the nation depends on self-determination. We hope that the people of the country will resolutely oppose this suicidal proposal. The association is determined to fight to the end together. The telegram is urgent and we cannot say everything."</p>
<h3>Youth Support-the-Ma Army Corps</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Reception for the Press</p>
<p>Zhang Shaojie Reports His Determination to Set Off</p>
<p>Hoping for Economic Assistance from All Circles</p>
<p>The Youth Volunteer Corps to the Northeast to Support the Ma Army and Resist Japan held a reception for the Shanghai press at 2:00 PM yesterday on the third floor of the YMCA on Sichuan Road. Over a dozen reporters from various newspapers and news agencies, as well as Huang Jingwan from the Commercial Press, attended. During the event, the corps leader, Zhang Shaojie, and others successively reported on the corps' past work, their determination to depart for the Northeast, and their scheduled departure north on the 6th. A general meeting of the corps members will be held at the Ximen Public Sports Ground tomorrow at 2:00 PM, and representatives from all circles are cordially invited to attend and observe. Details of the situation are recorded below:</p>
<p>Corps Leader's Report: The corps invited reporters from various newspapers and news agencies yesterday to report on everything. Those who arrived were accompanied by the corps' receptionists to their seats on the third floor. Around 2:00 PM, the corps leader, Zhang Shaojie, attended the meeting and reported on the organization's history, work content, and then expressed the corps' determination to head north soon, determined to embody the spirit of sacrifice, support the Ma Army, and resist Japan as a model for the nation. This trip will first go to Beiping and then to the Northeast to fight to the death with the violent Japanese. However, in recent days, although the work has been very active, the economic aspects have been advanced by some members of the corps. Now that the departure is imminent, it is hoped that all circles will provide economic assistance to help them fulfill their patriotic aspirations. Regarding fundraising, apart from Gong Shenghua's voluntary donation of land near Gaochang Temple, selling half the price of 1.9 mu of land to assist our corps, the sale has been underway yesterday but without a buyer. Although other parties are in contact, there is no definite certainty about donations. Before the departure date, it is imperative that all circles provide economic support. If there is still no solution before departure, the corps will inevitably find a way to leave Shanghai to demonstrate the firm initial intention to go to the Northeast to resist Japan and support the Ma Army. Zhang's words were extremely sad and resolute. Subsequently, Zhang introduced the corps' propaganda section chief, Liao Xiangchen, who briefly stated that when joining the corps, the comrades were almost all strangers, but the spirit gave a lot of excitement. Since taking charge of the propaganda section, the work has been allocated to various groups, focusing on art, books, and slogans. The Japanese army's devastation of the Northeast is meticulous, and such tragic publicity among the people sometimes has a greater moving power than writing. Next, the training section director reported that the training steps were carried out in two aspects: military and political. In the political aspect, there are currently no significant achievements. In the military training aspect, the members gather at the public sports ground every morning and afternoon for training, with more than 300 people attending daily. Although the clothing is not consistent, the serious and determined spirit of the members can be fully expressed. Our corps' creed is to swear to support the Ma Army and resist Japan, and the members can all obey military command.</p>
<p>Training Outline: The training section's work outline is divided into: A. Training Group, (1) Discussion Group, (2) Lecture Group, (3) Discussion and Lecture; B. Exercise Group, (1) Infantry Training, (2) Military Subject Lectures; C. Attendance Group, (1) Work Assessment of Cadre Personnel, (2) Work Assessment of Corps Members; D. Disciplinary Group, (1) Supervision of the Work of Various Sections and Corps Members, (2) Punishment for Neglect of Duty of Various Sections and Corps Members.</p>
<p>Corps Member Statistics: According to yesterday's separate statistics of the corps members, there are 166 party affairs personnel, 64 students, 96 middle school students, 44 workers, 92 merchants, 74 military police, 41 workers, 27 doctors, totaling 454. The First Detachment Officer Team has 45 people, and the Third Detachment National Salvation and Protection Team has 45 people.</p>
<p>General Meeting of Corps Members: The corps decided through a cadre meeting to change the general meeting of corps members to 2:00 PM this afternoon, still at the Public Sports Ground, inviting representatives from all circles to visit and guide. There will definitely be a tragic and heroic atmosphere at that time.</p>

<p>Scheduled to Come to Shanghai Today to Expedite the Transfer</p>
<p>The New Director, Mr. Yan, is About to Take Over</p>

<h3>Bai Yunti Arrives in Shanghai</h3>

<h3>Anhui People in Shanghai Strive for Unity</h3>
<p>Sheng Zhiren, Wang Lantian, Xiang Biwu, Lei Zikun, and others from the Anhui Public Association and Anhui party members in Shanghai sent a telegram to the Central Government yesterday for the sake of completing unity: "To the Executive and Supervisory Committee members of the Fourth Plenary Session in Nanjing and Mr. Hu Hanmin in Guangzhou, as well as the representatives of the Fourth Plenary Session: We have read Mr. Wang Jingwei's daily winter telegram and admire his integrity, which shines like the sun and the moon. The Shanghai Association has decided that this is the current path to democratic politics, and the whole country hopes for its realization. What is the intention of some representatives of the Fourth Plenary Session in Guangdong to overturn it, disregarding the current national crisis? How can they be so self-indulgent? Only trust and righteousness can convince people, and only indifference can show ambition. We hope for a change of heart to complete unity and not let those who seek political liberation be controlled by force. It would be very fortunate."</p>
<h3>Overseas</h3>

All descendants of the Yellow Emperor and the Han and Miao people should wake up with enthusiasm and swear to avenge this irreconcilable hatred. We deeply hope that all military and political leaders in our country should eliminate personal prejudices as soon as possible and order the drums to attack the enemy. Overseas Chinese will swear to be the rear support." Another telegram to Chairman Chiang and others said, "To Chairman Chiang, Deputy Commander Zhang, Minister He, and all armed comrades in Nanjing and Guangdong: Japan is taking advantage of our country's current difficulties to impose barbaric means. Overseas Chinese are outraged. We hope that you will eliminate personal prejudices as soon as possible, unite against foreign enemies, and order the drums to attack the enemy. The people swear to be the rear support. All overseas Chinese in Sibu, Sarawak, British Borneo, respectfully kowtow."</p>

Although Japanese warships entered Taijiang before, causing unrest among the citizens, they have withdrawn after negotiations by the provincial government. Minister Yang (Shuzhuang) returned to Shanghai from Nanjing last night (i.e., the day before yesterday) and will go to Fujian within about three or four days because the provincial government affairs are complicated. I came to inspect the navy in this port as usual, with no other special mission.</p>
<h3>Traces of Current Figures</h3>
<p>Ma Hongkui, acting chairman of Gansu Province, Liu Zhi, chairman of the Henan Provincial Government, and Zhu Qinglan, a disaster relief committee member, went to Nanjing by night express train yesterday.</p>
<h3>Wang Jialie Returns to Hunan from Shanghai</h3>
<p>Li Weibai Remains in Shanghai to Negotiate with Various Parties</p>
<p>Qinnianhaishe reported that Wang Jialie, commander of the Xiang-Qian Border Region Bandit Suppression of the National Revolutionary Army, was elected as a representative to the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee by the 25th Army of Guizhou Province and went to the capital to attend. After completing his duties, he came to Shanghai from Nanjing. He originally planned to stay in Shanghai for a few days to make contact with various circles, but due to the importance of border defense, he returned to Hongjiang, Hunan Province, a few days ago. Li Weibai, the secretary-general who came to Shanghai with Wang, is still staying in Shanghai to prepare for negotiations with various parties on important matters. According to Li, Commander Wang leads a total of nine regiments, about 15,000 men, who are working hard to suppress bandits in the Xiang-Qian border region and have won the hearts of the people, thus pacifying the local area.</p>
<h3>Chiang Fangzhen Reportedly Released on Bail and Coming to Shanghai</h3>

Jiang's chief of staff visited a certain important person yesterday and told him that Jiang had been released on bail by Chen Mingshu and Zhu Peide in Nanjing and regained his freedom yesterday. He will be able to leave Nanjing and come to Shanghai within a few days.</p>
<h3>Qin Xitian and Others</h3>
<p>Request to Change Shanghai to a Third-Class County</p>
<p>Qin Xitian, Li Zuyou, Qian Jiao, Huang Yunzhen, Jin Qingzhang, Niu Yongxiang, and other gentry from Shanghai County jointly submitted a request to the provincial government to change Shanghai County from a first-class county to a third-class county. The general idea was that Shanghai County currently has 240,000 mu of fields, all of which are located in remote areas, and its area is not as large as the counties north of the Yangtze River. However, it is now a first-class county like Wuxian County, which has 1.6 million mu. Compared with each other, it seems that the name does not match the reality, which makes officials and people suffer. Therefore, it is proposed to request the provincial government to change Shanghai County to a third-class county, which can both economize the provincial treasury's expenditure and reduce the burden on the local area. In addition to submitting it separately to the Civil Affairs and Finance Bureaus, the humble opinions are hereby presented to Ye, the chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, in the hope that he will adopt the humble suggestions for the benefit of all.</p>
<h3>Record of the County Executive Committee</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Party Department held its 31st Executive Committee meeting at 1:00 PM yesterday, chaired by Peng Liren. The report matters were omitted. Discussion matters: (1) The First Direct Branch requested to forward to the central government a plan to quickly determine national defense plans and strengthen border defenses to resist foreign aggression. Resolution: approved for forwarding. (2) The First Direct Branch requested to forward to the central government a request to permanently expel Zhang Xueliang from the party. Resolution: forwarded as requested. (3) Omitted. (4) Committee member Peng proposed that a letter be sent to the Education Bureau to instruct all primary and secondary schools in the county to use anti-Japanese resistance as the central teaching material and conduct large-unit teaching for propaganda purposes.

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession has approved a temporary measure regarding changes in tap water prices. Generally, there will not be much change in the current water prices. At the same time, due to the impact of the silver price rebound, the company's finances, how to implement Hill's recommendations, and how to reduce the burden on poor users have all been considered. As for the long-term method of setting water prices with water meters, it will be discussed later.</p>
<p>The company's proposal was submitted to the Public Utilities Committee of the Municipal Council, and the Director of Finance and Auditing reviewed and reported that he had consulted with the company and drafted a temporary measure as follows: (1) The current water price list (with surcharges included) will continue to be implemented, but slightly modified as follows: (a) The current price of water used by the Public Works Bureau is 3.75 cents per thousand gallons (with surcharges included), which will now be changed to 4 cents. (b) The landlord who is responsible for the water price of a property should calculate the water price based on the net rental income, not the gross income. (c) The current flexible system of collecting water prices based on the meter should be further promoted so that users who use a large amount of water can get a significantly lower water price. (2) The system of collecting water prices based on the meter should be further promoted, and the company should start installing water meters in designated areas immediately. (3) The implementation period of this method is not specified at present, but the Municipal Council and the company can both propose modifications for legitimate reasons, such as significant changes in the exchange rate. According to the Municipal Council's previous allowance of an additional 25% surcharge on water prices, it was attached with the condition that if the exchange rate reaches 2 shillings per tael, a separate agreement should be made. This condition still exists today. (4) During the current temporary method period, the Municipal Council and the company should carefully consider Hill's recommendations and study the extent to which they can be implemented so that the interests of both users and shareholders can be taken care of. At the same time, a public welfare surcharge water price method should be considered to reduce the burden on poor users. The committee found the report of the Director of Finance satisfactory and suggested that the company be allowed to implement this method. This method has now been approved by the Municipal Council.</p>

<h3>After British Yarn Arrives in Shanghai</h3>

<p>Those Who Changed to Weaving Wool and Silk Products Also Gradually Restore to Their Original State</p>
<p>After all circles automatically rejected Japanese goods, there was a great panic about the raw materials for the knitting industry in this city. However, for the sake of resisting Japan and saving the country, they vowed not to import Japanese raw materials again. Those who had to announce a shutdown accounted for 30% of the city. Due to the lack of raw materials, those who changed to weaving wool and silk products accounted for 40% of the city. At the same time, they also ordered British yarn from British foreign firms to provide relief.

As a result, knitting factories that have been shut down have resumed operations one after another, and the rest are gradually returning to their original state. At present, the foreign exchange rate is quite good, and the cost of ordering goods is relatively low, so merchants are generally happy to order goods.</p>

<h3>Mingde Principal Accused of</h3>
<p>Embezzling Aid-to-Ma Donations</p>
<p>Municipal Party Headquarters Dispatches Investigators</p>
<p>Yesterday, students of the night school at Mingde Middle School in Sanxin Lane, North Sichuan Road, suddenly petitioned the Municipal Party Headquarters, accusing the school's principal, Wu Mengyan, of embezzling donations for the support of General Ma Zhanshan. After receiving the petition, the Municipal Party Headquarters ordered the Civil Training Section to investigate the matter to determine if the accusations were true. The students' petition is recorded below:</p>
<p>"Petition regarding fundraising irregularities, disrespectful to the nation and violating the law, requesting your esteemed association to investigate thoroughly.</p>
<p>Mingde Middle School in Sanxin Lane, North Sichuan Road, prepared 200 donation boxes, distributed by Principal Wu Mengyan to students, for fundraising to support General Ma Zhanshan. For donations of one yuan or more, or two jiao, a card was issued as proof. After several days of fundraising, the results were excellent. Each donation box contained an average of over 800 yuan. The total was estimated to be around 10,000 yuan, or at least 7,000 to 8,000 yuan. Unexpectedly, Principal Wu Mengyan had ulterior motives. That night, he secretly broke open the donation boxes and reported that the total amount collected was only 1,300 yuan, including counterfeit bills, copper coins, and nickel coins. He claimed that there were only 98 donation boxes. Students were shocked and enraged upon hearing this and questioned the principal. They found another donation box in the bookcase, which contained over 300 yuan. When questioned further, the principal initially blushed, then became angry and forbade further discussion, threatening to expel any 'reactionary elements' immediately and hand them over to the headquarters for severe punishment. The students, under duress, were powerless to resist.</p>
<p>Considering General Ma's isolated and arduous battle, bringing honor to the nation, and Principal Wu's position as a school leader who bullies weak students and skims off donations, his crime is worse than the Japanese invaders a thousand times over. We feel obliged to present the circumstances in a written petition to your esteemed association for thorough investigation, for the sake of public convenience.</p>
<p>Respectfully submitted to the Executive Committee of the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Headquarters.</p>
<p>Respectfully submitted by the night school students of Mingde Middle School, Sanxin Lane, North Sichuan Road, Shanghai. (The school's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association seal has been confiscated by the principal; we hereby declare this.)"</p>
<h3>Grandson of Sheng Xuanhuai</h3>
<p>Attempts to Divide Estate</p>
<p>Accuses Sheng Zecheng et al. of Embezzlement</p>
<p>Request for Provisional Attachment Denied</p>
<p>Lin Fengwen and Lin Fengjun, grandsons of the late Qing Dynasty Grand Tutor Sheng Xuanhuai, recently hired lawyers Dong and Yu to file a criminal lawsuit with the First Special District Court, accusing Sheng Xuanhuai's children, Sheng Zecheng, Panchen, Pingchen, Yu Chang, Yu You, Guan Yi, Ai Yi, Jing Yi, and others, of embezzling 3 million yuan of inheritance. The court approved the complaint and issued summonses, ordering both parties to appear for questioning.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM, Judge Shen Shumu convened a hearing in the Third Criminal Court. The plaintiff, Lin Fengwen, arrived at the court around 2:00 PM with lawyer Dong, but none of the defendants appeared, nor did they authorize lawyers to represent them. Judge Shen then instructed the plaintiff's lawyer to present the charges.</p>
<p>Lawyer Dong stated that the plaintiffs are the nephews of the defendants. Last year, the plaintiffs' mother passed away, and they requested the defendants to divide the inheritance equally. The defendants agreed to an equal division. However, on October 31st of this year, the defendants divided the estate without allowing the plaintiffs to participate, thus constituting embezzlement of property. Since the defendants failed to appear today, they should be arrested, and the property at 526 Jing'an Temple Road should be subject to immediate attachment under Article 127 of the Criminal Procedure Law.</p>
<p>Judge Shen ruled that he could not approve this request, as none of the defendants were present. The hearing was postponed to Friday afternoon of next week.</p>
<h3>Xue Die's Appeal Rejected</h3>
<p>Appeal Costs Borne Separately</p>
<p>Last winter, film star Hu Die suddenly received a letter from her fiancé, Lin Xuehuai, proposing to terminate their engagement. Hu responded that she was willing to negotiate under reasonable conditions. Lin persisted, even declaring an end to their relationship. Realizing that a reconciliation was hopeless, Hu hired lawyer Zhan Jifeng to file a lawsuit against Lin to dissolve their engagement, claiming that Lin's unprovoked breach of contract had wasted her youth and demanding 1,000 yuan in compensation for emotional distress, as well as the repayment of all the advances and loans she had made to Lin over the years.</p>
<p>However, once the lawsuit began, Lin refused to dissolve the engagement and denied all the debts. This spring, after repeated hearings and evidence review by the First Special District Court, the court ruled that the engagement should be dissolved and that Lin should repay the demonstrable debts, amounting to slightly over 1,000 yuan. Hu's request for 1,000 yuan in compensation was rejected.</p>
<p>Lin, dissatisfied with both the dissolution of the engagement and the debt repayment, hired lawyers E and Ni Zheng'ao to appeal to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, seeking to overturn the original verdict and maintain the engagement. Hu, through her lawyer, also filed a cross-appeal, demanding that Lin be held liable for the breach of contract and pay 1,000 yuan in compensation.</p>
<p>The High Court's Second Branch held two hearings and concluded its deliberation, scheduling the verdict for December 2nd. Yesterday afternoon, when the verdict was due, many people hoping to see Hu Die arrived at the court's Second Civil Division to wait. By 2:30 PM, there were over 200 men and women in the audience. It was then learned that neither Hu Die nor Lin Xuehuai would appear in person. However, those who wanted to know the outcome of the case remained. Lin's lawyers were also absent, but Hu's lawyer, Zhan Jifeng, was present to await the announcement.</p>
<p>Shortly after, Presiding Judge Hu and Judges Shen and Ye took their seats and announced the verdict: Lin Xuehuai's appeal and Hu Die's cross-appeal were both rejected. Each party was to bear their own appeal costs. The court adjourned. The second instance of the Xue Die engagement case, which had caused a sensation in Shanghai, could be considered concluded. Whether Lin intends to pursue a third appeal or will accept the verdict remains to be seen.</p>
<h3>Murder Suspect</h3>
<p>Collapses After Arrest</p>
<p>Injures Head with Handcuffs</p>
<p>Relevant Parties Interrogated Yesterday</p>
<p>The three-story Western-style house at 196 East Seward Road was occupied by Zhu Yangshan from Qingpu, with the ground floor rented to Yichang Electric Company. On the morning of September 19th, around 1:00 AM, thieves broke in and stole valuables worth over 1,000 yuan, and fatally stabbed Zhu's relative, Gu Cao, and the maid, Zhou Lu. Later, Cai Zhitian, a Chinese detective from the Hongkou Police Station, arrested the suspect, Ma Er'er (the rickshaw puller), a native of Tongzhou, and handed him over to the First Special District Court. He was convicted and sentenced to death.</p>
<p>The afternoon before yesterday, around 5:00 PM, Lu Gensheng, a Chinese detective from the Dixwell Road Police Station, received a tip-off that a suspect in the case, Zhang Xianjun, nicknamed "Little Yellow Hair," from Tongzhou, would be passing through Fairground Road. He went to wait and arrested Zhang, along with his fellow villagers, Yang Dushu and Qu Hanming.</p>
<p>During questioning, Zhang initially denied being called "Little Yellow Hair" and claimed ignorance of the robbery and murder. However, after witnesses identified him as "Little Yellow Hair," he admitted his identity. The detectives then searched his home at 8 Tangshan Road but found no stolen goods. Zhang Xianming (his younger brother), Ji Haikun (a friend), and Li Along (a suspect) were also arrested and detained.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, they were handed over to the Third Criminal Court. Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, stated that the case, in which Ma Er'er had already been convicted and sentenced to death, was unique. Ma Er'er, along with Zhang Xianjun, Zhang Xianming, and Ji Haikun, had been drinking in a tavern and, inebriated, armed with two sharp knives, entered the house through a hidden passage over the wall. They first entered the room of Zhu's maid, Zhou Lu, and began to rob her. When she cried for help, Ma Er'er stabbed her repeatedly. Zhang Xianjun then delivered the final blow, killing her. Zhou Lu suffered eight stab wounds in total.</p>
<p>They then entered Gu Cao's room, demanding that she hand over the 500 yuan she had recently won in a lottery. When she refused and cried for help, they also stabbed her to death. They then stole the clothing and fled.</p>
<p>The next morning, Gu Cao's three-year-old son climbed to a high place and tapped on the windowpane facing the street. This happened again around 5:00 PM. His hands and face were covered in blood. People noticed this and went upstairs to investigate, finding Zhou Lu stabbed to death on the floor. They reported it to the Hongkou Police Station, which sent Detective Cai to the scene. A blood-stained shirt, which had been discarded by the thieves and identified as belonging to Ma Er'er, was found. He was arrested, and the case was solved.</p>
<p>In summary, their robbery and murder were extremely cruel and brutal. The three-year-old child, unable to speak, suddenly climbed to a high place and tapped on the window, and Ma Er'er left his blood-stained shirt at the crime scene. It was truly divine retribution. Furthermore, after Zhang Xianjun was arrested, he collapsed while being taken to the victim's house for identification and injured his head with his handcuffs. He is currently being treated at the Shanghai Municipal Council's Public Hospital. The case should be adjourned for further investigation.</p>
<p>Judge Xiao Xieying questioned the defendants and ordered them to be remanded in custody for a future hearing.</p>
<h3>Boy Kidnapping Case</h3>

<p>Other Bandits Given Prison Sentences</p>
<p>Jiang Jia-shi, a seven-year-old boy named Jia-shi who lived at 529 Tiantong Road and was the son of Jiang Zirong, the owner of the Yi Tai Iron Shop, was kidnapped on the afternoon of November 7th. The bandits demanded a ransom of 50,000 yuan. The Hongkou Police Station arrested twelve suspects, including Shen A-san, Yu Zhulin, Yu Rui, and Qian Zhangyue. They were handed over to the First Special District Court. After hearing the case, the court awaited sentencing, as previously reported.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xiao Xieying presided over the Sixth Criminal Court. Shen A-san and Yu Zhulin were sentenced to death for kidnapping and demanding ransom. Qian Zhangyue and a woman named Yang Wu were sentenced to life imprisonment. Yu Rui and a woman named Qian Qiu were sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment. The number of days spent in detention before the verdict will be credited at a rate of two days for each day of imprisonment. Yang Wenguang, Zhang Mingzhao, Wei Senlin, Wang Yuanlin, a woman named Qian Wang, and a woman named Zhu Jinfeng were all found not guilty.</p>
<p>The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, requested that Qian Wang be remanded in custody at the women's prison during the appeal period, which the court granted.</p>
<h3>Unable to Find Work in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Couple Attempts Suicide</p>
<p>Husband Dies, Wife Saved</p>
<p>Financial Distress Causes Tragedy</p>
<p>Li Haochuan, 33, from Nantong, had once been involved in the cotton yarn business on the exchange but lost his fortune due to speculative failures. He returned to his hometown to make a living. At the beginning of last month, he and his wife, Wang, 33, brought their belongings to Shanghai, hoping to find work to make ends meet.</p>
<p>Upon arriving in Shanghai, they checked into Room 35 of the Huishang Inn at 628 Fujian Road. Every day, he went out to visit friends, hoping to find an opportunity to avoid starvation. However, things did not go as planned. After spending over ten days searching, he found few opportunities. They had already accumulated over 30 yuan in debt for room and board at the inn. He had also borrowed money from relatives and friends, but they were reluctant to lend more due to previous unpaid debts.</p>
<p>Li Haochuan found himself in a difficult situation, unable to advance or retreat. The desolate inn added to his sorrow. He felt that it was better to end his life than to continue suffering. He decided to commit suicide and discussed it with his wife, Wang, who agreed.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, they bought opium and both took it. They then went to his wife's brother's house at 106 Xiangfu Lane, Carter Road, to say goodbye. Soon after, the effects of the poison took hold, and they appeared distressed. Their relatives, realizing what had happened, immediately hired a car and sent them to Shilong Hospital for treatment. However, Li died due to an overdose. Wang survived.</p>
<p>Li was wearing a gray cloth robe and a black wool vest. His wife was wearing a gray cotton qipao with a fake wool qipao vest. Their clothing was old. In the room, there was only a medium-sized suitcase, a small suitcase, and a net basket containing miscellaneous items. According to people at the inn, Li was very frugal. Every morning, he only ate a few crab shell cakes. Even for lunch, he only ate the ordinary meals served at the inn. He owed the inn over 30 yuan. The remaining items were not worth half that amount. Li's death due to financial hardship was truly tragic.</p>
<h3>Child's Head Found</h3>
<p>Next to Garbage Bin</p>
<p>Temporarily Entrusted to Forensic Doctor for Preservation</p>
<p>Investigation Awaits Discovery of Body</p>
<p>At approximately 11:00 AM the day before yesterday, Liu Qingxiang, a small worker from the Sanitation Department of the Public Works Bureau, discovered a child's head on the ground near a garbage bin at 165 Parker Road. Liu immediately reported it to the Xinzha Police Station, who sent Chinese and foreign detectives to investigate. They sent the child's head to the autopsy room on Phillon Road. Yesterday morning, Guo Wei, a prosecutor from the First Special District Court, inspected the body at the autopsy room and issued the following order:</p>
<p>"The head of an unidentified deceased child has been examined and will be temporarily entrusted to the forensic doctor for preservation, pending investigation and resolution of the case."</p>
<h3>Inheritance Murder Case</h3>
<p>Zhang Guoxiang's Life Out of Danger</p>
<p>Court to Punish the Case Severely</p>
<p>Zhang Zhang, concubine of the late Zhang Linsen of Huayuan Shiqiao, Pudong, conspired with her younger brother Zhang Quansheng to murder Guoxiang, the eldest son from a different mother, and Yuxiang, the second son, so that her son Qingxiang could inherit the estate alone. Yuxiang was killed on the spot, and Guoxiang was injured.</p>
<p>It is now confirmed that the bullet in Guoxiang has not yet been removed, but his life is generally out of danger. Zhang Quansheng's gun was originally a Yun-style gun, but he exchanged it for a four-inch pistol from Yang Fulin of Tangqiao because it was more convenient to carry. The court has confirmed this.</p>
<p>Guoxiang has also reported to the court that on the day of the incident, he and Yuxiang were returning home from a banquet at Lan Ni Du. Zhang Quansheng and Qingxiang ambushed them in the dark, shone a flashlight on them, and opened fire on him first, hitting his cheek. He fell to the ground. They thought he was dead. Yuxiang, seeing his brother shot, stepped forward and exclaimed, "Uncle, why did you kill my brother?" Fearing that Yuxiang would be a witness, Quansheng also opened fire, accidentally killing him. Their motive for the murder was to inherit their father's estate, which was all in the possession of their stepmother. Since the stepmother had recently died and had not yet passed the seventh day memorial, they treated him and Yuxiang differently and hatched this evil plan. He requested that they be punished to the full extent of the law.</p>
<p>The court recognizes that this case violates human ethics and will be severely prosecuted to serve as a warning.</p>

<p>The shipping business of Nissin Kisen Kaisha is currently being liquidated, and the Ruiyang Maru, which had been operating on the Yangtze River, ran aground above Nantong last month. The company made every effort to salvage the ship, sending six or seven ships to tow it. However, the hull was stuck in the sand, and the towing was too forceful, causing the Ruiyang Maru to break apart. The crew returned to Shanghai. The company suffered a significant loss. The details of the incident are recorded below.</p>
<p>Cause of Grounding: The Ruiyang Maru departed for Hankou on the 11th of last month and ran aground 60 nautical miles above Nantong, at a place called Monk Sand. The cause of the accident was that the captain, who had been transferred from the ocean liner Baling Maru, was not familiar with the waterway. It was his first voyage on the ship.</p>
<p>Unloading and Ferrying Passengers: The cargo and passengers bound for Hankou were transferred to the Xiangyang Maru, which the company sent to Monk Sand to take them to Hankou. Multiple tugs were sent to Monk Sand to wait for high tide and attempt to salvage the Ruiyang Maru. However, during the last high tide, the Ruiyang's engine broke down. The opportunity was lost, and the Ruiyang's hull gradually sank and could not be moved.</p>
<p>Hull Breaks Apart: Last week, the river level rose slightly. The company urgently sent the Xinyang Maru, which was docked in Shanghai, with steel cables to Monk Sand. The cables were attached to the bow of the Ruiyang Maru, and the Xinyang Maru, along with six or seven other small tugs, towed the Ruiyang with full power. However, the Ruiyang was deeply stuck in the sand. The towing force was too great, and the Ruiyang Maru's hull broke apart behind the smokestack. Fortunately, the towing was stopped immediately, or the ship would have broken into two pieces.</p>
<p>Crew Arrives in Shanghai: After the Ruiyang Maru broke apart, all hope of salvage was lost. The crew, sailors, and stewards were ordered to leave the ship and returned to Shanghai on small tugs, where they were temporarily dismissed. Only a dozen people, including the captain and firemen, remained on board. Currently, the water level at the grounding site is less than one or two feet, and even small tugs cannot get close. The ship is in a hopeless situation.</p>
<p>Transporting Wood and Binding the Ship: After receiving the news that the Ruiyang Maru could not be salvaged and that its hull had broken apart, the Shanghai office urgently sent the Yiyang Maru to Shanghai to transport a large quantity of wood and a group of shipbuilders and technicians to Monk Sand. They planned to temporarily bind the broken part of the hull with a large amount of wood to prevent it from breaking completely. Then, they would wait for the river level to rise next spring to attempt to salvage it. For the remainder of the year, they would have to leave it abandoned on the sand.</p>
<p>The grounding and breakage of the Ruiyang Maru has resulted in a significant loss. Whether it can be used for sailing in the future is currently unknown.</p>
<h3>Used Clothing Collection Points Closed</h3>
<p>Donations Can Be Sent to 1 Jiujiang Road</p>
<p>The National Government's Flood Relief Committee has been collecting used clothing for three months. By the end of November, the Shanghai branch alone had collected 200,000 pieces of used clothing. An additional 70,000 to 80,000 pieces were received from other locations and overseas Chinese communities. In total, nearly 300,000 pieces of clothing have been collected.</p>
<p>The committee has decided that since the autumn season is over and winter is approaching, people have already donated clothing and blankets. There is no need to maintain a large number of collection points, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Therefore, the collection points at various organizations, schools, and churches were closed at the end of November. The original receipts and labels from the collection points have been retrieved. People who wish to continue donating clothing can send it directly to the committee's information center at 1 Jiujiang Road for direct collection.</p>
<h3>Flood Relief Committee</h3>
<p>Actively Planning Relief Work in Hunan and Hubei</p>

<h3>Ho Tung Holds Golden Wedding Anniversary in Hong Kong Yesterday</h3>
<p>Sir Robert Ho Tung, a well-known philanthropist in Hong Kong, celebrated his (50th anniversary) Golden Wedding Anniversary with his wife on December 2nd. From 4:00 PM to 8:00 PM at the Peninsula Hotel, they received congratulations from friends and guests. It is estimated that no less than 2,000 people attended the celebration. The entire seventh floor of the hotel and the rooftop garden of the Rose Room were reserved for the event, which was a lively affair. The Governor of Hong Kong, Sir William Peel, and Lady Peel, along with Admiral Sir Howard Kelly and his wife, General Sandilands, the Chief Justice, and members of the Hong Kong Legislative Council and the Executive Council, attended to offer their congratulations. Former Colonial Secretary of Hong Kong, Mr. Lochart, and the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce sent congratulatory messages.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government's</h3>
<p>Completed Lengthening and Renovation of Ferryboats</p>
<p>Inspection of Ferry and Coal Storage Facility</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government's cross-river ferries originally consisted of three vessels. The design of the hull was based on the needs of the 16 Pu and Qingning Temple areas. Each ferry could carry 50 to 60 passengers, or as few as 20 to 30 passengers. The emphasis was on speed and convenience rather than size.</p>
<p>Previously, the Public Utilities Bureau, at the request of the Jianghai Customs River Department, deployed two of the ferries to operate between the Wayside Wharf and Qichang Warehouse. Because the passengers at that location were mostly factory workers, they felt that the small ferries were insufficient to accommodate the large crowds. As workers were required to arrive at the factory at a specific time, they were unwilling to wait. The bureau determined that the hull and deck, steel frames, and iron plates needed to be lengthened to increase the capacity to 150 to 160 passengers.</p>
<p>After the proposal was approved by the Municipal Government, the construction and lengthening project was contracted to Hexing Machinery Manufacturing Factory. The project has now been completed. On December 1st, the Municipal Government sent Mr. Qin from the Science and Technology Section, along with Deputy Director Cao of the Ferry Management Office of the Public Utilities Bureau, to inspect and accept the project. The ship, originally 17.1 meters long, has been lengthened by 2.4 meters to a total length of 19.5 meters, significantly increasing its capacity. The interior of the cabin has also been renovated. The test speed reached 8.21 knots per hour. It is reported that it will be transferred to Wayside Wharf for operation soon. If the operation is satisfactory, the remaining two ferries will also be renovated in a similar manner.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Public Utilities Bureau, to meet the coal needs of the cross-river ferries, contracted with Guanghua Construction Company to build a coal storage facility on Dongchang Road, Pudong. A portion of the facility was also designated for ferry employees' living quarters. The construction has also been completed. It was inspected and accepted on the previous day.</p>
<h3>大生紡織公司股東常會</h3>

After the reports, the chairman announced the proposed matters: (A) Proposal to recall shipping receipts and reissue Dasheng Shipping share deposit certificates; (B) Proposal to issue additional shares in accordance with the resolution of the previous shareholders' meeting; (C) Proposal to add automatic looms to the auxiliary factory; (D) Proposal to build a power plant; (E) Proposal to approve the company's articles of association. All of the above proposals were discussed and approved. Then, supervisors were re-elected. As a result of the voting, Chen Guangfu, Fang Juchuan, and Yun Jishen were re-elected.</p>
<p>On the 29th, the Dasheng Second Factory held its meeting at the original location. A total of 52 people attended, with more than half of the shares represented.

Both proposals were discussed and approved. Subsequently, some shareholders raised concerns about the factory's purchase of expensive cotton in early spring and improper business operations, leading to some disputes. The board of directors explained that during these times of tight money, the factory's operations could not be suspended for long. Even if things did not go as planned, they still had to make concessions to the banking syndicate. If the banking syndicate did not interfere in the future, they would strive to reorganize and improve personnel matters, which might still yield some positive results. Supervisors were then re-elected. As a result of the voting, Li Bake and Shen Kunshan were re-elected.</p>
<p>On the 30th, the Dasheng Third Factory held its meeting. A total of 65 shareholders attended, with more than half of the shares represented. Mr. Hu Kezhi was elected as chairman.

The proposed matters were: (A) Report on the addition of looms and cotton cleaners, requesting ratification; (B) Proposal to approve the company's articles of association. Both proposals were discussed and approved. Then, shareholders proposed on the spot to distribute dividends from the current term's profits. After public discussion, it was decided that the profits for the current term were not substantial, so they would be temporarily retained and distributed together in the next term. The majority approved. It was also resolved that any future expansion of machinery and equipment exceeding 100,000 taels of silver should be subject to the approval of the shareholders' meeting. Furthermore, when purchasing foreign cotton, the foreign exchange rate should be fixed at the time of purchase, without any speculative nature. The entire meeting passed these resolutions. Then, supervisors were re-elected. As a result of the voting, Wu Nanpu and Li Yunhou were elected. The meeting was then adjourned.</p>
<h3>彩印公會復菸廠公會函</h3>
<p>Regarding the Issue of Printed Materials for Tobacco Factories</p>
<p>The Shanghai Color Printing Trade Association replied yesterday to a letter from the Shanghai Cigarette Factory Trade Association, stating:</p>
<p>To the Shanghai Cigarette Factory Trade Association:</p>
<p>We have received and understood your letter of November 30th. Our reply is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) In our letter of November 23rd, we requested your association to forward a message to the Huada and Huacheng Tobacco Companies, requesting that all subsequent printed materials be permanently contracted to members of our association. This was because your association's letter of November 18th indicated that the Huada and Huacheng Tobacco Companies' printed materials had once again been contracted to the San-Yi Printing Company. Since our association resolved to expel San-Yi from our association, the two tobacco companies have switched all their printed materials to be contracted by members of our association. You requested us to promptly send a telegram to the Guangzhou Municipal Chamber of Commerce Anti-Japanese Association and the Chinese Tobacco Association to provide proof, etc. Our association immediately sent a telegram to the aforementioned groups in Guangzhou to provide proof, and also replied to your association, sending a copy of the telegram for your review. We also stated that since our association had sent a telegram to provide proof, we had assumed considerable responsibility for the two tobacco companies. Therefore, we requested your association to forward a message to the two tobacco companies, requesting that all subsequent printed materials be permanently contracted to members of our association, both because our association had sent a telegram to provide proof, and because this patriotic movement must be sustained permanently, and we must not repeat the mistake of a "five-minute fever." The previous letter is on file and can be reviewed. Your statement that it is "nitpicking" is not in accordance with the facts.</p>
<p>(2) On October 28th, representatives from your association visited our association to mediate the San-Yi Printing Company affair. Our association expressed that we greatly appreciated your association representatives' good intentions for mediation, and we were very willing to accept them. However, San-Yi's violation of the patriotic movement aroused the public anger of our members, and we had to await the public decision of the members' assembly. At that time, your association representatives proposed that all printed materials used by your association members' cigarette factories in the future be contracted to our association. After discussion, our association felt grateful for your association's kindness, but our association is a public organization for the trade, and it is not convenient for the association to directly accept printed materials. Fortunately, our association's membership list has been sent and published in the newspaper, and we can ask the cigarette factories to freely order printing from our association members' printing companies, to avoid any suspicion of manipulation. This matter does not conflict with our association's reply to your association in our letter of November 23rd. As for your letter inviting representatives of our association, Lu, Wang, Huang, and Hu, to visit your association today to discuss the matter, we will certainly go to learn from you at the appointed time.</p>
<p>Furthermore, after reading the reports in today's and yesterday's newspapers, your association's announcement stated that all the capital of San-Yi Printing Company is Chinese-owned, and notified your association members' cigarette factories to take note of this. Our association's resolution to expel San-Yi Printing Company from our association was because the company colluded with Japanese merchants, which was contrary to our association's resolution and the anti-Japanese and overseas Chinese aid association's announcement. Whether the company is entirely Chinese-owned is a separate matter. All of our association's resolutions and important correspondence have been sent for your review on the 6th of last month. Now, your association is publishing an announcement in the newspaper, introducing San-Yi Company, which our association has already expelled, to your association members' cigarette factories. We deeply regret this.</p>
<p>This is a combined statement.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>The Shanghai Color Printing Trade Association</p>
<p>To the Shanghai Cigarette Factory Trade Association</p>

<h3>中華劍術研究會近訊</h3>
<p>The Benefits of Chinese Martial Arts Research Association</p>
<p>The benefits of Chinese martial arts to society are not only sufficient to defend against foreign insults, but also, if practiced step by step and trained properly, can greatly temper the body, invigorate the spirit, and promote ambition. Among the most subtle and profound of Chinese martial arts is swordsmanship. The Shanghai Chinese Swordsmanship Research Association has been in operation for almost ten years since its establishment. Although there are not many people studying in the association, they are all patient, enduring, and consistent from beginning to end. Therefore, they have been able to make progress every day. Such an organization that studies Chinese martial arts is truly rare in today's society. It focuses on practical matters and does not pursue outward appearances. Those who are interested in Chinese martial arts should pay attention to it. The instructor in the association is the famous swordsman Mr. Mi Jianhua. The association is located at No. 7, Daxingfang Alley, Ximen Road, French Concession.</p>
<h3>保衛團長向法警行賄</h3>
<p>Sentence of One Month Imprisonment</p>
<p>Luo Weiren, the head of the Baowei Tuan (security corps) of Longwangmiao in Pudong, because a local woman, Fu Su, sued her stepson, Fu Shunsheng, and nephew, Fu Meisheng, in the local court for assault, the local court dispatched police to arrest Fu Meisheng and others. At that time, Luo intercepted the arrested person and bribed the police officer three yuan. The police officer reported to the prosecutor, who dispatched police to arrest Luo and Fu Meisheng together. A public prosecution was immediately filed. Yesterday, Judge Zhao of the Criminal Court held a trial. Luo bitterly reproached himself and requested leniency. Therefore, the judge announced that leniency would be granted. Luo Weiren and Fu Meisheng were each sentenced to one month of imprisonment for bribery and will be sent to prison to serve their sentences. The assault case involving Fu Meisheng, Fu Shunsheng, and others will be tried separately.</p>
<h3>黃楚九家</h3>
<p>Regarding the Issue of a Huge Amount of Jadeite</p>
<p>The Carver Claims to Have Returned the Jadeite</p>
<p>Creditors Request to Participate</p>
<p>After the Shanghai Daily Night Bank collapsed, the French Court instructed accountants Pan Zhaobang and Wu Zheng to liquidate the bank, its affiliated Gongfa Company, and the Huang Chu Jiu family assets together. The accountants found that Huang owned several hundred pounds of jadeite stones valued at over one million yuan, and entrusted jade giant merchant Liu Xiang Geng to carve them. The previous French Court was informed and summoned Liu on July 8th to hand over the goods. This has been reported in the past. Yesterday morning, the Second Special Court opened an enforcement court to hear the jadeite case.</p>
<p>Liu Shi Geng was represented by his partner, Li Dahui, who stated that Liu Bao Geng was not present due to business, and that he had brought all the jadeite stones to the court. Some of the jadeite stones were at Wang Songnian's place. Wang Songnian claimed that he was from Yangzhou and had been in the jade business for many years. In February of last year, Huang Chu Jiu entrusted him with 50 or 60 pounds of jadeite stones to carve a jadeite incense burner and two jadeite figures. However, because the jadeite material was not good, he returned the jadeite before finishing. He returned the two carved jadeite figures after finishing them, and charged 1,000 yuan for labor. All procedures and handovers were clear, and there were no other goods stored at his place. Creditor lawyer Yan Luqing stated that it was difficult to trust whether Wang Songnian's claims were accurate and requested the court to order him to provide a written guarantee. At this point, Tan Yigong, the lawyer representing the Huang family, rose to object, stating that this case was handled by the previous French Court entirely at the request of the Huang family, and there was no need for the creditor's lawyer to participate. If there was anything inappropriate, it should be raised by the accountants Pan and Wu. Lawyer Yan retorted that the liquidation staff were representing the creditors, and since Huang Chu Jiu was the manager of Gongfa Company, the creditors had the right to participate for the sake of their interests. Lawyer Tan argued that they could not participate, and asked on what legal basis. Judge Wang Weizhen announced that whether the creditor's lawyer needed to participate was not an issue in this case. As for the jadeite stones handed over by Liu Shi Geng, they would be temporarily stored at the court. The court would instruct the accountants Pan and Wu to conduct a thorough investigation with the Huang family's lawyer to determine if there were any other jadeite stones handed over to Liu and Wang. A decision would be made after a report was submitted.</p>

<p>Reader's Correspondence</p>
<h3>洛陽李次樊君訊</h3>
<p>News from Mr. Li Cifan of Luoyang</p>
<p>(Advocates for a Unified National Armed Resistance Against Japan)</p>
<p>Our China has suffered the most severe devastation by the violent Japanese in this instance. Since Japan occupied Liaoji on September 18, and then occupied the Black Province, countless tragic events of burning, killing, looting, and raping have been happening to their extremes. All patriotic comrades are filled with indignation. However, the government does nothing, and we are helpless. Government officials are negotiating with the League of Nations today. Can the League of Nations really resolve the Northeast Incident? Although we do not know the truth, based on my humble opinion, the League of Nations Council is seeking their own interests. If they have the opportunity, they may even want to profit from it. This is the main reason why the League of Nations is constantly thinking and holding meetings day and night. As far as I can see, recovering lost territory by force is the happiness of our people, and a peaceful resolution is a great disaster for our people. We must know that if we continue to be perfunctory and maintain a policy of non-resistance, even if negotiations with Japan are completed, Soviet Russia will come, and other countries will come. The country will be destroyed and the race will perish, and there will be no recovery.</p>
<p>Starting from this point, if the whole country unites and arms itself to fight to the death against Japanese imperialism, even if we unfortunately fail, we will have unparalleled glory. Moreover, Japan has many weaknesses and may not necessarily be able to defeat us.</p>
<h3>蘇州履登君訊（問救國方法）</h3>
<p>News from Mr. Lü Deng of Suzhou (Asking for Methods to Save the Country)</p>
<p>The violent Japanese are unscrupulous, occupying our Liaoji and advancing into Heilongjiang. For two months, the young officials have said, "Do not resist," and the National Government has said, "Be calm," but only beg for help from the League of Nations, while the soldiers and generals throughout the country, armed and ready to fight, remain inactive, watching as our great land is abandoned to the hands of the Japanese bandits. Only General Ma Zhanshan is fighting to resist the enemy, which is truly painful. Only a small number of patriotic people throughout the country have organized volunteer armies and anti-Japanese national salvation societies, while the rest continue to live their lives of getting by. The general psychology of people is that they have wives, property, and fields, so even if the country is destroyed, their families will not be destroyed. The Japanese may not necessarily take all their property or their lives, and everything should be left to fate. Alas, today's country is not the country of the former Manchu Qing government, but the country of our people. We must know that national affairs are family affairs, and how can the family survive if the country is destroyed? I sincerely hope that my compatriots will wake up early, unite to save the country, and not become the second Korea. I am a small apprentice in a shop. Besides advising my relatives and friends not to buy enemy goods, I do not know what other methods of saving the country there are. I hope to receive guidance.</p>
<p>(Reply) Your letter is sincere and admirable. If you ask for methods of saving the country other than external ones, I will introduce you to Ms. Huang Huibai of Suzhou's six oaths to save the country, which are well-written. The way to save the country lies in practical action.</p>
<p>(1) Starting today, vow to stop all entertainment, banquets, and miscellaneous expenses (such as drinking alcohol, tea, cigarettes, etc.) and use the saved money for national salvation.</p>
<p>(2) Starting today, vow to practice frugality and implement the principle of thrift, and use the remaining expenses for national salvation.</p>
<p>(3) Starting today, vow to exercise for one hour and read books that benefit the mind and body for one hour every day.</p>
<p>(4) Starting today, vow to work harder at existing jobs.</p>
<p>(5) Starting today, vow not to use enemy goods, and not to use foreign goods unless absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>(6) Starting today, vow to persuade at least one person every day to implement the above oaths.</p>

<p>Letter</p>
<p>To whom it may concern: Your newspaper published on November 30th that our company was carelessly burned down, and that Renyuanyong Straw Mat Shop was the cause, this is inconsistent with the facts. Our investigation found that Renyuanyong Coal Ball Stove was responsible for the fire. In addition to Renyuanyong’s shop being completely burned, the fire also spread to the back building of our company. The facts are clear and easy to investigate. Our company's losses from this fire are estimated to be more than 3,000 gold in destroyed goods and water damage. This matter concerns the reputation of our company. Therefore, we are writing to request a correction. We would be most grateful for your kindness. Shunchatai Jute Bag Shop, Dadama Road, Nanshi, December 2nd.</p>
<p>To whom it may concern: On December 1st, your newspaper published in the local news column that the principal of Minli Middle School, Su Yingjie, was sued by Gu Shanbao for not providing support, and that they separated last year. This information is inconsistent with the facts. Please correct it immediately, as the two parties have not separated. To the Chief Editor of Shen Bao, Lawyers Jin Yu and Liu Shiqi, December 2nd.</p>

<h3>Movie Sketches: Reed, Dream, Special</h3>
<p>Common Law</p>
<p>Judging from the past history of Pathe, it does not seem to have gained the trust of the general audience. The reason is that it is not a top-tier major company in the United States, like Paramount, Universal, Fox, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and First National. Its productions are often weak in spirit and lack surprising potential. Therefore, although it has persistently supported and fought hard every year, it has ultimately been unable to succeed. Even though it spends a lot of money on advertising every year, few people pay attention. However, since the three letters RKO were added to the beginning of its name, it has been exactly the opposite of before. Through its efforts and sacrifices, it has clearly produced many excellent productions. As a result, the American movie fans of the whole year, after enjoying two hours in the dark, have received wonderful fantasies in its productions as if in a dream. Everyone has a deep and positive impression of RKO Pathe's productions.</p>
<p>Indeed, this is the crystallization of the brain and blood of artists, and the achievement of science and money. Therefore, as soon as its productions arrive at the film room of Shanghai Peacock Company, several top-tier theaters compete to take them for premieres.</p>
<p>"Common Law" is its first shot into Shanghai. The Chinese name currently showing at the New Light is called "Revealing Spring Light," and this is the first shot.</p>
<p>"Revealing Spring Light" stars the uniquely gentle female star Constance Bennett. The script is adapted from Robert W. Chambers' novel, which writes about the greatness and purity of love, powerfully impacting people's hearts while making people understand the romance of romance.</p>
<p>Its background is the Latin Quarter of Paris, which depicts the life of the Latin Quarter. The Latin Quarter is full of Bohemians, struggling artists, all with a strong soul, young and full of blood. The protagonist in the play, Louis (male), is one such young man, leaving his rich and comfortable family to enjoy the romantic life of his youth, and desperately studying painting in a small building in the Latin Quarter.</p>
<p>However, painting requires an object, which is a model. However, once there is a model, the inevitable progression of daily life for men and women in a "groove," as my friend Mu Lu Cha calls it, occurs due to the blood of youth, the observation of eyes, the burning of hearts, and the stimulation of sex. However, the author wants it to have twists and turns, waves, interest, excitement, and stimulation, so it is carefully depicted to make it extraordinary in the ordinary, deliberately using artistic techniques of expression to make the audience follow the twists and turns of the plot, grasp the plot as if in a dream, and successfully create their own wonderful fantasies. This kind of charm is unique to movies, and this charm is expressed in "Revealing Spring Light," subtly and inexplicably seizing the soul of every audience and making them shout.</p>
<p>"Revealing Spring Light" is good, of course, because of the charm mentioned above, but this charm is not found in every movie. I have seen a lot of Western movies, but not many have charm. Because it is not easy to produce unless talents from all aspects are gathered together and cooperate. Just like "Revealing Spring Light," we know that it does not cost much capital, but the joint cooperation of talents from all aspects really allows people to see their spirit of unity. The author has written with all his spirit, which is already known to the readers. And others, such as the screenwriter, director, and leading actors, all use their hearts and blood to cooperate, which they have gained through cultivation and experience. Look at how beautiful the original work is, how meticulous the script is, how tight the director is, and how the performances coincide with the personality, thorough and profound. Even scientifically, and in terms of scenery, we all know that it has been considered in advance. The male lead is a young man with a firm personality, and the female lead is a pathetic and unparalleled young woman, but they both regard the story in the play as their own facts and leave themselves to perform the characters in the play without any affectation or reluctance. Then the characters in the play are active on the silver screen, not Judah McLaglen and Constance Bennett. However, they, Judah McLaglen and Constance Bennett, can make us see their usual cultivation on this point.</p>
<p>According to Hollywood news, Constance Bennett has married the husband of Gloria Swanson, who had just divorced. She is a young woman who married at the age of sixteen, had a son at the age of seventeen, and is now not even twenty years old. Of course, this has nothing to do with "Revealing Spring Light," but her charms can be imagined.</p>
<p>There is another layer of "Revealing Spring Light" that makes it unforgettable, that is, Constance Bennett's unique gentleness, and her beautiful lines, flute-like figure, skin, and the beauty of her feet.</p>

<h3>Three Dollars and Fifty Cents</h3>
<p>— Xian Lu</p>
<p>"Lu, our overseas students' association is having a meeting today, isn't it?" Ming, wearing his pajamas, walked into the dormitory from the washroom, smiling.</p>
<p>"Of course, I received the meeting notice too," I replied, feeling annoyed.</p>
<p>"Are you going?"</p>
<p>"Going? Of course, I'm going, just to..."</p>
<p>"...hand over my duties." At this moment, I remembered how much effort I had put in for the editing work last term to publish a small booklet. So, I really didn't feel like going to this meeting.</p>
<p>"Go, go, I'll go too," Ming seemed to sense my displeasure and encouraged me to go.</p>
<p>At one o'clock after lunch, Ming and I took a bus to Park Station and walked into the new dormitory of the Faculty of Law. I looked at room number nine and knocked on the door a few times. Many voices inside responded, "Come in!" I pushed the door open and went in. Dozens of fellow students who had arrived before me stood up together and shouted, "Oh, you're here! Please sit down, please sit down..."</p>
<p>"I'm really sorry to have kept you waiting," I said apologetically.</p>
<p>Then, the standing committee member led us to a classroom for the meeting. After we sat down, I noticed that there were still less than fifty people. Ming asked in surprise, "How come? We have more than a hundred members. Are only forty people here?"</p>
<p>"Humph, this is already considered good. You don't know, these old gentlemen of ours would rather go to the cinema to watch a movie. Usually, there are only a dozen people at the meetings," I couldn't help telling him.</p>
<p>After the reports of each department's work were finished, and almost all the proposals had been discussed, the election began. Unfortunately, I was re-elected as the editor this term. After the standing committee announced the election results, everyone, their enthusiasm exhausted, was preparing to leave. He raised his voice and shouted, "Are there any temporary motions? Please bring them up quickly!"</p>
<p>"Yes," I responded by raising my hand, "How should the publication plan for this term be formulated?"</p>
<p>Because of my motion, the atmosphere of the meeting became tense again. Everyone was talking and discussing, with different opinions. In the end, it was decided that because the reorganization of this term was too late, only a quarterly journal of dozens of pages would be published for the time being.</p>
<p>"Then how will the funding be raised?" I still had to ask urgently.</p>
<p>Everyone was a bit troubled by this issue, remaining silent and motionless. Suddenly, someone stood up and said, "Please have the accountant report on the financial situation of the association."</p>
<p>"Report on the financial situation? Currently, there is only thirteen yuan, sixty-three cents left after expenses. There is also an outstanding bill. The remaining amount is limited," the accountant reported calmly.</p>
<p>"Then, there are still several hundred yuan of subsidies that haven't been paid. Can we ask the general association to pay a little?" the person who had just spoken asked again.</p>
<p>"That's absolutely impossible. The branch association cannot use the general association's money," the standing committee member refuted his motion.</p>
<p>"I propose soliciting donations from fellow townsmen in Shanghai," someone else suggested, "such as Military Commander Chen, wealthy man Cheng... aren't they all our Jiangjing compatriots? They would probably be willing to contribute a little."</p>
<p>"Ugh... that won't work either," the standing committee member shook his head and said repeatedly, "Didn't they all say 'Spend money to buy someone scolding me'? Actually, our usual remarks haven't denigrated them in any way. But it's still very difficult to get them to donate money."</p>
<p>As the discussion continued, it seemed like they had reached a dead end. Asking students to share the expenses in this era of economic hardship was out of the question. Furthermore, the people in charge felt that if they did so, even more people would avoid attending the next meeting. In the end, it was still a few unlucky committee members who had to bear the brunt. It was decided that the required funds should be borrowed and distributed by all the committee members, to be returned when the association's finances were sufficient. You think the association's finances could ever be sufficient in a hundred years?</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>I began to collect money from the committee members present, but some said they were inconvenienced today, some asked me to pay for them in advance, and some hadn't even attended today. If I waited to collect from each school, the transportation costs would probably be a lot. I carefully calculated what I had received. Oh, heavens, it was only three yuan and fifty cents!</p>
<p>The evening breeze blew sharply on my face. Sitting in the car at the time, I felt a chill at the thought of how to publish a quarterly journal of dozens of pages with this three yuan and fifty cents.</p>
<h3>Women's Army</h3>
<p>— Jun Liang</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, since the invasion of the Eastern Provinces by the brutal Japanese, the ladies in the palace have become much more simple in their dress, thanks to the warnings of the speakers. I remember that the speaker said something like this that day:</p>
<p>"...Look back at our domestic university students, indulging in extravagance, especially the female students, almost all wearing silk stockings and leather shoes, and clothes in red, green, and all sorts of colors, dazzling the eyes..."</p>
<p>At that time, the speaker even pointed to a certain lady and said,</p>
<p>"In this time of national crisis, look at how beautifully dressed our female students are!"</p>
<p>As a result, the lady's fair cheeks instantly turned red.</p>
<p>After this incident, the ladies' clothing tended towards simplicity. Was it their awakening, their fear of being criticized, or their momentary patriotic impulse? We outsiders cannot make a definitive judgment. In short, they are now simple.</p>
<p>Every day, when the morning light is faint and the dawn mist is hazy, the ladies have to practice with the male students. Looking at this gray women's army from afar, we can't believe that these women soldiers in cloth clothes are the charming and beautiful ladies from the forbidden palace.</p>
<p>The trainer of the women's army is a male student. He always shouts orders very enthusiastically every day. Besides admiring his efforts for resisting Japan and saving the country, we naturally don't dare to say that he has other purposes.</p>
<p>On the day of the group inspection, the male students' uniforms were still missing. The team was full of Western suits and military uniforms, while the women's army all wore blue cloth clothes. The spirit of the women's army made the young masters have to admit defeat.</p>
<p>The commander-in-chief, in order to boost the prestige of the inspection, specially rode a white horse, holding a command knife and observing the whole field. Slight laughter was heard from time to time in the women's army.</p>
<p>Suddenly, there was a disturbance in the field, followed by the girls' clamoring. An accident occurred in the women's army. The young masters all craned their necks to look. It turned out that one of the girls in the women's army fainted on the field because she couldn't stand the scorching sun. Immediately, the nursing team carried out their work - moving the canvas bed, taking medicine, and a flurry of activity slowly calmed down.</p>
<p>"Under the gentle autumn sun, the girl couldn't stand the training and fell ill. How can she go to the front line in the future? Alas, women's army!" It was the sigh of the young masters.</p>
<p>Standing under the gentle autumn sun for three hours, the inspection ceremony closed with a call of slogans. The young masters and the women's army dispersed in a rush.</p>
<p>Several beauty-loving girls in the women's army hurried back to the palace to change their blue cloth clothes. Although they had realized that clothing must be simple, the blue cloth uniform, which looked like a female tea room's clothes, inevitably made them feel too unsightly.</p>

<h3>Book and Newspaper Introductions</h3>
<h3>A History of World Literature · Tang · Zeng · Yang</h3>
<p>Written by John Macy, USA</p>
<p>Translated by Hu Zhongchi, Published by Kaiming Bookstore</p>
<p>The first draft of the History of World Literature was published in the "Art World" of Shen Bao. The translator, Mr. Hu, revised it twice before the whole book was printed. Now, this magnificent work of 300,000 words is meeting us in the Chinese publishing industry, and we are very happy, because we who study literature have added this perfect history of literature, and at the same time we deeply admire the translator's firm efforts in doing this great work in the translation world.</p>
<p>This book was originally written by John Macy of the United States. Macy was an outstanding contemporary literary critic. He spent four years writing this book. His life as an author and critic can be said to be the preparatory work for writing this book. He devoted his life to literary interest, as well as the meticulousness of his diligent reference, textual research, and care, which is naturally the first masterpiece of his life.</p>
<p>This book is indeed a perfect history of literature. It explains the great writers who have influenced various nations in the world for thousands of years and their mutual relationships, important periods and their backgrounds. As for the special style and value of this book, it is what our readers should recognize. The author and translator have already told us in the preface at the beginning of the book.</p>
<p>In my opinion, this fulfills all the duties of a history of literature. If it is said that this is a little different from a pure history of literature, then the difference is probably that this book does not put on the face of a scholar like a general history of literature. It is written in a lively and fluent writing style, giving readers the pleasant feeling of listening to a story.</p>
<p>This passage is very clear. Here, we know that this book contains a special flavor, which is the so-called meaning of "story" or "historical story".</p>
<p>I very much hope that readers will have a considerable understanding of this book and welcome it happily. I can make a summary of its content, but because the material in this book is very rich, and the details are very complicated, it is impossible to introduce it in detail due to the limitation of space. Here, only a very brief and very general explanation is given in terms of its outline. As for the detailed content, readers must appreciate it themselves.</p>
<p>The whole book is 300,000 words, and the outline is divided into four parts. The first part is the ancient world, the second part is the Middle Ages, the third part is modern literature before the nineteenth century, and the fourth part is the nineteenth century and modern times. Each part is further divided into many chapters. Below the chapter number, there is an important title, and after the title, there are many programs of analytical narration. Combined, it is extremely complex.</p>
<p>The first part | The Ancient World | This part is divided into thirteen chapters, starting with the manufacturing of ancient books and the development of printing machines and paper materials, followed by an explanation of the beginning of literature, with spoken language preceding written language, and then there are songs and prose, from the beginning of literature to the Eastern mystery and to Jewish literature, the Holy Book of Talmud, etc. Chapters five to nine all describe Greek poetry, drama, prose, philosophy, and Greek history and historians. Chapter ten talks about Roman history and historians. Chapters forty-one to thirteen discuss Latin narrative poetry, drama, philosophy, and prose, etc. The second part | The Middle Ages | The Middle Ages part has four chapters, starting with the origin of the Germanic, Gillett, and Romance systems, followed by French literature in the Middle Ages, early German and Scandinavian literature, and the great Italian poet Dante.</p>
<p>The third part | Modern Literature before the Nineteenth Century | Divided into sixteen chapters, describing, after the Middle Ages, the Italian Renaissance, and French prose, poetry, and drama before the nineteenth century, describing in great detail, followed by modern German literature before the classical era, Spanish and Portuguese literature before the nineteenth century, English literature and literature other than drama before the Elizabethan era, and plays of the Elizabethan era before Shakespeare, Chapter twenty-six is devoted to describing Shakespeare, and the textual research is very precise and elucidating. After that, other playwrights of the Elizabethan era are described, and eleven representative writers are selected for research. Chapters twenty-eight and twenty-nine describe English lyric poetry and prose in the seventeenth century. All the great poets have excellent works. Chapter thirty-one describes English literature in the Restoration era and prose and poetry in the eighteenth century. Contemporary writers such as Addison, Swift, Steele, Fielding, Congreve, Pepys, Blake, Gray, Thomson, etc., all have very detailed descriptions.</p>
<p>The fourth part | Nineteenth Century and Modern Times | Divided into sixteen chapters, this part starts from chapter thirty-four, describing the romantic revival in English literature, represented by poetry. At that time, great poets such as Byron, Shelley, and Keats were born, and the British literary scene was a very prosperous page. Nineteenth-century English novels such as Scott, Thackeray, the Brontë sisters, and other famous novelists and Hardy | A general description of modern novelists. After that, discuss British essayists and philosophers such as Lamb, Hazlitt, Müller, Darwin, Spencer, etc.</p>
<p>Victorian poetry. Poets emerged at this time, countless. Chapter thirty-eight describes nineteenth-century French literature, that is, the romantic era of French literature, occupying a supreme position in the literary department, that is criticism. The following chapter describes French poetry. The first great poet in the group of romanticists was Lamartine. Later, the French poetry world had the rise of the Parnassians and Symbolists, and successively experienced their journey. Chapter forty describes the classical era of German literature. The great writer of this era was Goethe. His novels such as "The Sorrows of Young Werther" and dramas such as "Faust" were world-famous masterpieces at that time. In addition, Schiller, who was as famous as Goethe, first came to the world with his prose drama "The Robbers" and "Kabale und Liebe". His beautiful and sublime revolutionary structure and the power of character depiction, and he built the foundation of modern art in prose tragedy dialogue. After Goethe, German literature, romantic lyric poetry has a long life, and Heine has the highest reputation.</p>
<p>Nineteenth-century Russian literature, what makes us particularly interested is the prose novel. The creators of modern Russian literature were two poets, Pushkin and Lermontov. They also wrote prose, and were strongly influenced by Byron. Later, the Russian literary world produced three great novelists, Turgenev, Dostoevsky, and Tolstoy. The main works and styles of the three are discussed in detail.</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>Chapter forty-three is Italian literature after the Renaissance. In the golden age, Tasso was the last great genius. The power of the Italian Renaissance in the late period was in that prose, reaching the romantic movement that captured and conquered the intellectual power of the Italians in the first half of the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>Chapter forty-four describes modern Spanish literature. The main writers such as Don Quixote, Arnalbin, Pereda, Valle-Inclán, Baroja, Valera, Arolyn, etc., all have very precise descriptions, as well as criticism of their works and values. Chapter forty-five travels through Dutch and Flemish literature. Dutch literature has not been very important in the world for a long time, because the Dutch have devoted all their power to arts other than literature. Its oldest translation is the world-famous book "Reynard the Fox", which seems to be the only great story popular in Dutch translation. The greatest Dutch poet is Vondel. After this era, Dutch literature declined. Most of the works in the eighteenth century were very dull, and it was not until the beginning of the nineteenth century that the resurrection came. Related to Dutch literature is Flemish literature, which still has special vitality due to its political situation.</p>
<p>Chapter forty-six describes Scandinavian literature, including the literature of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. It describes the writers and works of each country in succession, and the influence of European literary trends at that time.</p>
<p>Chapter forty-seven, American novels, contributed to European literature with a romantic style. The famous writers in the novel world are Irving, Cooper, Poe, Hawthorne, Stowe and more than a dozen others. The next chapter is American essays and history, and the last chapter is still American poetry.</p>
<p>The above is a brief introduction to the content of this book. I think this book also has a valuable place. At the beginning of each chapter, there are a few words about the famous people in this chapter, giving us a very awakening and sharp interest. There are many portraits of writers from various eras and countries in the article. Almost every world-famous literary master has his portrait, which also gives us an understanding of the writer.</p>
<h3>Japan's New Manchuria-Mongolia Policy · Zhou · Le · Shan</h3>
<p>Written by Yamada Takeji Translated by Zhou Peilan</p>
<p>For two months, the brutal Japanese have been actively plundering our Manchuria and Mongolia with force. In this time of national crisis, no one is not preparing to resist Japan.</p>
<p>The study of Japan's new Manchuria-Mongolia policy has become the focus of the reading community.</p>
<p>So many people are temporarily studying the Manchuria-Mongolia issue today, which shows that they were usually indifferent to the Manchuria-Mongolia issue, but "catching up" is our way to make up for our mistakes, and it is also not to be blamed.</p>
<p>In short, all citizens should study the Manchuria-Mongolia issue. This is a "natural" responsibility.</p>
<p>The "Japan's New Manchuria-Mongolia Policy" that I am introducing now is an important book for studying Japan's policy toward China.</p>
<p>The content of this book is as follows:</p>
<p>Chapter one discusses the special status of Manchuria and Mongolia and the Manchuria-Mongolia policy. Chapter two discusses the elements of Manchuria-Mongolia development, such as the Manchurian Railway's pioneering undertaking, the Manchurian Railway Company and its mission, the active external policy, the laying of the Ji-Hui Railway, the promotion of the Great Pioneering Undertaking, and the overseas development of higher-level vagrants.</p>
<p>We will verify what is said in this book with today's current business. It is true that there is no difference. Everything was in the Japanese's predetermined plan. Now it is just implementing his plan.</p>
<p>Chapter three and later chapters are especially shocking, such as the fundamental strategy for the renewal of Manchuria and Mongolia. The author, Yamada Takeji, said firmly, "However, how can our country promote Manchuria and Mongolia to be a truly special region? We must renew its method. In the past, our country's method of merging Manchuria and Mongolia was no more than the following four types:</p>
<p>1.  Merging Manchuria and Mongolia into Japanese territory.</p>
<p>2.  Manchuria and Mongolia become a Japanese-mandated territory.</p>
<p>3.  Manchuria and Mongolia are the birthplace of the Qing Dynasty, and reinstate the deposed Emperor Xuantong as the sovereign of Manchuria and Mongolia, while Japan</p>
<p>掌握其政治·財政·軍事·及</p>
<p>掌握其政治·財政·軍事·及 controls its political, financial, military, and</p>
<p>Other All other actual powers.</p>
<p>4.  Or under Zhang Zuolin's protection of the territory and security of the people, take</p>
<p>取特别手段、無論如何、須斷 take special measures, no matter what, must</p>
<p>乎措置者也、 be taken decisively.</p>
<p>Compatriots, the fact that Japan is invading us before our eyes is completely within their predetermined plan. Items one, two, three, and four are all being actively carried out.</p>
<p>Chapter four discusses the Manchuria-Mongolia policy and the Northeast Asia policy. There is such a passage, "Japan's development to Northeast Asia and the Soviet Union's development to the Far East, because of the relationship between the national conditions, have to compete with each other. However, if the current state is repeatedly allowed, then the interests of Japan and Russia will inevitably conflict or, unfortunately, Japan and Russia will meet on the battlefield again." In order to avoid the battlefield, when our country implements the great strategy of Manchuria-Mongolia renewal, we have to seek compromise with Russia.</p>
<p>This passage can be used to observe the recent international situation. Japan is compromising with the Soviet Union on the one hand and guarding against the Soviet Union on the other. Therefore, the Soviet Union has not launched any attacks in the past two months, completely falling for Japan's compromise plan.</p>
<p>From chapter five, "Manchuria, the Second Korea," we can see that Manchuria and Mongolia in the eyes of the Japanese already belong to them and are not owned by China. He said, "...Today's Russia is very different from the imperial era, and China is also different from the Qing Dynasty, but its power is not as strong as it was in the past. If we look at the combination of China and Russia, the order and chaos of East Asia, and the rise and fall of Japan, the current Manchuria and Mongolia are no less than 'Second Korea', and it is definitely not a wrong statement, which can be deeply believed..."</p>
<p>In short, the translator of this book introduced this book to China with a deep intention. It is a pity that the Chinese people are too indifferent to national affairs, especially the distant Manchuria and Mongolia, and regard them as "the fat and thin of the Qin people in the eyes of the Yue people", which is insignificant. Therefore, it has come to this point today.</p>
<p>If the Chinese people paid a little attention, how could this book still be in its revised edition after being sold from the sixteenth year?</p>
