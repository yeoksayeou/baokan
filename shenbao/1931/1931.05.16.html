<p>時評</p>
<h3>白里安赴日内瓦</h3>
<p>本來議會政府制之國。其重要在内閣。内閣得人。對内與議會和洽。對外與友邦合作。國家地位。方克鞏固。總統雖龐然居上。實際不如内閣中一要職之關係鉅也。然而世人多震於總統之虚榮。第竭一黨一派之全力以相爭。從未有自甘放棄者。乃此次法國之選舉總統。左派中欲保持白里安外長地位。使得繼續其向來外交政策。故利用不記名投票以失敗之。而白亦並不以失敗懊喪而辭職。今且毅然赴日内瓦。以周旋於國聯會議矣。此亦足見今人思想。已進於實際。而不沾沾於總统之虚榮矣。蓋今日法國在外交上所處之地位。最爲重要。國際間關係世界安危之大問題。今皆待决於日内瓦會議。而尤以法國之外交方針爲轉移。故此次選舉揭曉後。參與議會各國之代表。皆注目於白氏之行動。向表同情於白氏之外交政策者。皆以白氏不以得失爲意。而稱許爲不愧政治大家。吾人觀察今日世界之情勢。白之去留。關於歐局前途。誠甚重大。而法政黨寗犠牲最榮譽之總統名號。以求貫澈其交政策。亦實今日之政黨中難能可貴者也。</p>

<h3>决賽情形</h3>
<p>千五百米　男子組徑賽昨僅此一項决</p>
<p>賽、中央張元生與中公馬逢瑞固最有希望者、但張日前曾患神經衰弱症、昨竟一籌英展名落遜山馬逢瑞一路浩浩、莫與爭抗、以四分四三秒五分四創大會新紀錄第一中央周名璋落後約三十米、聞中央大事本校運動會時、張元生曾將周退後四五十米、故張昨日如身體健全、堪與馬一爭先後、而成績當亦因之更有可觀也、</p>
<p>女生二百米　昨日本爲預賽、因人少</p>
<p>而改爲决賽、曁南黃鸞嬌曾一度領前、步伐頗大、姿勢亦美、但至後尙餘五十米時、中央吳珠還忽疾步進發、衝出鸞嬌女士、名列冠軍、成績爲三十三秒八、平平而已、</p>
<p>男生跳高　此項成績、未曾出色、復旦</p>
<p>李琳於一米六○即失敗甚可惜、進至一米六三、尙有五人、吳錦祺以一米六九居首、陳隋因高欄方罷、以一米六四次之、餘三人、分名次時竟皆退至一米六三下或皆已甚慌甚之故、</p>
<p>女生跳高　初加入者僅五人、後陸續</p>
<p>而來、第一中央葉瞻美與大夏陸偉坤、競爭甚烈、高度相差僅一格、葉成績爲一米一八、平平　　女生鉛球　曁南王蘭茵七米九八第一</p>
<p>賽者似皆不能利用彈力、擲度故不遠、</p>
<p>男生跳遠　人才最多、當推跳遠、最有</p>
<p>希望之中央趙汝功、犯規二次、第三次棄權、甚可惜、王季淮帶病比賽、遠來居上、六主六二得第一名、</p>
<p>男生鐵餠　昨日風勢甚大、成績不能</p>
<p>减出、王季淮因病未得分、中大高尙志以三十一米○米冠軍、平平而已、</p>
<p>田賽大王光華王季淮、前日進冰淇淋數包、復進以麫、又吃冰淇淋、乃大瀉、昨日負病比賽、故鐵餠未得分、跳遠則仍得第一、</p>
<h3>錦標形勢</h3>
<p>—中央與曁南—</p>
<p>—已短兵相見—</p>
<p>本届大會、中央以上届冠軍資格、大隊人馬浩蕩而來、實力雄厚、保持錦標、頗具雄心、惟曁南大學秣馬厲兵、矢志一决、以昨日成績觀之、中央似未必勝曁南頗有望也、爲述錦標之形勢、　　—田賽錦標—</p>
<p>中央緊張　昨日得分、中央雖居首、然僅勝曁南三分、中央最大失敗、即在跳遠、趙肗功二次犯規、第三次即棄權、致最有希望之一人、全軍</p>

<h3>複賽成績</h3>
<p>男生百米</p>
<p>第一組（一）鍾連基（曁）（二）蔣鵬（光）（三）黃飛龍（曁）十二秒第二組（一）顧再平（復）（二）郝春德（曁）（三）馬幼成（光）十一秒七（按）　賽祇此一項、二百米因人少未舉行覆没、反使曁南得第二名增三分今日曁南撑竿跳有曹裕、標槍有温鼎新鐵球謝全和亦不弱、中央正未許樂觀、惟三級跳趙汝功或能奪回一席、是則尙有望也、然光華田賽亦非弱者、中央須加倍努力方可、</p>
<p>—徑賽錦標—</p>
<p>曁南加鞭　徑賽之中、曁南希望較多、短距離或不能居首、亦當能控制一切、百米及二百米有鍾連基郝春德黃飛龍、四百米有符和蕃曾榮忠、此一項分數頗多其他須努力加鞭、亦有望也、中大兩欄陳陵可穩取十分、短距離已全部失敗、要看長距離如何爲斷矣、</p>
<p>—女生錦標—</p>
<p>中央有望　中央人才最多、他校曁南外、參加者絶少、昨日已得十八分、今日五十米百米穩取荆州、錦標大半歸之矣、</p>

<p>趙先生名鴻翔。字詩高。生而洪楊事起。父兄被擄。母亦早逝。養於叔父。九歲入塾。日習經文數百言。家貧歲饑。不能具束修。出爲人牧。稍長。富膂力。精騎射。應縣試。以第一人入武痒。嘗應鄕舉。馬蹶不試。遂絶意進取。會邑匪烏帶黨亂。洶洶薄城邑。縣令不能救。士夫集議終日。計無出。先生請嚴守備。而躬往省垣請援。陳説當道。乃出兵。發縱决策。日夜不寢。逾月大破。斬其渠。事平。郡守奇其材。欲祿之。不顧也。性剛毅。善裁斷。嚴正足以服人。凡集議城鄕公益。衆論紛紶。輒數言平定之。鄕故强悍善訟。至是皆决之先生。訟不於令者數十年。壬寅癸卯間。淫曲熾盛。先生痛惡之。禁莫入境。瞰其他去。有無賴子挾淫伶入。翕衆張歌舞。先生倉卒歸。諸伶粉墨衣舞衣。雜親衆俱奔。先生狀貎魁梧。美髭髯。布衣潔素。目光如電。家雖貧。甚慷慨。里嫗子佃田爲生。歲凶主者索租急。母子相持泣。先生分粟與之。嫗死無以歛。又資棺槨。性喜客。憾身不學。尤折節禮士人。生子三。長雪詠。季雪珍。先後爲嵊縣巡緝隊隊長。次即觀濤師長。訓督綦嚴。朝敷敎。夕課行。恒以勤苦自飭爲誡。嘗曰。先人所遺惟此苦字。苦。吾家業也。安而樂之。其無墜乎。辛亥革命軍興。先烈陳英士將北伐。觀濤棄學潛出入軍籍。時父兄議追踵。先生獨不可。且笑曰。吾老矣。若在少壯之年。且與兒輩絶塵而馳耳。比觀濤從征齊魯。則曰汝行不吾告。吾不汝憾。若猝膺艱苦。情怯而還。則吾所大惡也。嵊山邑也。故多匪。辛亥壬子間。匪益熾。先生創設團練。督率捍禦。如前平烏帶黨亂時。鄕以無事。閲十六年。終始不懈。匪莫得逞。晚年愛獨秀山景物。山踞剡溪上游。彌望平原。極幽泉怪石之勝。有張嵊。衛夫人。王右軍遺蹟。嘗策馬盤桓其間。一橋一石。摩挲殆遍。病革時。雪詠將召觀濤歸。先生怒上之曰。吾所期於汝弟者何。豈欲戀戀一訣哉。黨國肇建。江南初定。長驅逐北。正國爾亡家之日也。汝弟蓄志革命。願久未逐。今乘戰勝之勢。衝鋒陷陣。寗無狼瞫爲右之用。吾何憾乎。十六年三月十五日没。年七十有五。鄕里對於先生懿行。至今猶稱道勿衰。觀濤師長其時因軍事方殷。奪情遠役。視含負士。旣未獲親。垂哀茹憾。行且五年。今軍事稍閒。擬廣徵文辭。以期垂先型於來茲云。</p>
<h3>羅浮梅絮</h3>
<p>— 斐</p>
<p>梅蘭芳抵粤之後一日。廣州劇界假人和會館開大會歡迎。附近居民多爭欲睹梅氏豐采。臨時集合可數萬人。途爲之塞。有因擠擁不上而起爭端者。幸由軍警維持。始免意外。粤人於梅歡迎之盛。於此可見。</p>
<p>廣州開演以來。無日不滿座。每日收入總在八千元之外。近雖謠諑繁興。賣座依然如故。所謂「國家興亡誰管得。滿城爭説呌天兒。」大有此種氣象。</p>
<p>歐陽予倩在粤創辦戲劇研究所。頗著成效。梅氏特往訪問。舊雨相逢。彌增愉快。翌日。歐陽設席欵梅。席次。關於改革戲劇事宜。有詳細討論。歐陽謂舊戲長處亦甚多。惟須順合現代潮流。逐漸改進。梅氏深以爲然。並詳述游美後所得感想。滔滔不絶。歷數小時之久。兩情至爲融洽</p>
<p>梅氏在海珠戲院共演一星期。已於五月六日赴香港。定七日在高陞戲院開演。至十一日上止。十二日重返廣州。再續演十一天。即行期滿。</p>
<p>梅氏廣東演畢。或作南洋之行。現正在接洽中。如果成爲事實。則在粤畢後。亦必回滬一行。然後再去。蓋舊曆四月二十五日。爲杜月笙先生家祠落成之期。梅已先期有約。届時演劇爲祝云。</p>
<h3>龍舟競賽新端陽</h3>
<p>— 芮鴻初</p>
<p>莫利鎭人烟稠密。商店林立。生涯鼎盛。男女學校共卅處。井然有序。國歷五月五日。爲新端陽佳節。各學校循例休假一天。以示慶祝。前二日。秀明女學校長金文君女士。發起競賽龍舟。以代運動。男女生之報名者二百人。先駕舟考試打漿。錄取三十人。僱小舟三十艘。舟身首尾。均以紙紥黃龍。張牙舞爪。雙目裝小電泡。是日上午八時。在運河舉行競渡大會。到者有各界要人。男女校長。均欣然觀賞。金女土令諸生登舟。一人駕一舟。龍首挿一小旗。臨風飄揚。評判員莫利學校校長徐夢㾗君。下動員令。漿板齊下。各舟突飛猛進。浪花四濺。結果育蠶學校學生施方茂。獲得錦標。贈畫墨龍一幅。掌聲雷動。諸生賽畢登陸。口唱競舟歌而散。</p>
<h3>紅樓夢中之「駁回」</h3>
<p>— 浪漫書生</p>
<p>紅樓夢一書。不知顛倒了多少青年男女。本書的好處。不但寫情處深刻到極點。就是叙事處也就描摹得到家。其中單説王鳳姐處事的方針。在紅樓夢裏的「駁回」一項。大約就可分爲三種。</p>
<p>（一）駁他的回。</p>
<p>（二）又不好駁他的回。</p>
<p>（三）不好駁回。</p>
<p>第一種是鳳姐慣對那些媽子丫鬟用的。因爲這些媽了丫鬟。在榮國府裏無所倚恃。所以一個不對。就直捷痛快加以「駁回」了。第二種是鳳姐對寳玉·黛玉·惜春·寳釵等用的。因爲本人雖然無權。但都深得老太太疼愛的。所以遇着事兒。每每「又不好駁他的回」。只好用些方法來對付。或者給他打個七折八扣。用種折衷的辦法來解决。第三種是鳳姐對老太太·王夫人·薛姨媽等用的。因爲這些簡直是頂頭上司。所以百事百依。「不好駁回了」</p>
<p>我們看了上面這種情形。不禁就以小喻大。從一個家庭中的處事。聯想到現在的官府來了。現在有許多中級機關。處理政事。大概也就不外乎這種情形。遇着普通人民。不妨秉公處理。差不多的就「駁他的回」。遇着那有些聲望的人。那麽。對於面子上的關係。不好直捷駁他的回。祗得想個法兒。給他下個折衷調停。倘然遇着那大來頭。或是自己的上官。那就實在「不好駁回」。除了奉命維謹外。還有什麽辦法呢。</p>
<h3>黃海環遊記（四）</h3>
<p>— 黃炎培</p>
<p>砂金產。地有屬於松花江東源流域之夾皮溝。鴨綠江上流通化附近大廟溝。五鳳樓。北山城東南香爐碗子。鐵嶺站東紫河堡等處。但產額之富。無過於北滿黑河一帶。所以田中奏稱。「滿蒙之利源。悉集於北滿。」而對之　涎欲滴也。</p>
<p>撫順煤礦内。尙有油母頁岩。其藴藏量二萬一千餘萬噸。其成分含油百分之一十四。即在露天發掘區域。亦有四百萬噸以上。</p>
<p>依日人調查。遼吉黑三省及熱河未墾地尙占總面積十之一。而已耕地僅占可耕地百分之六十。其對於每年農產之推定。大豆三萬八千萬石。高梁三萬六千萬石。粟二萬六千萬石。玉蜀黍一萬三千萬石。該館對於大豆之用途與其製造方法。用實物。用圖。用表。種種表示。尤爲詳盡明白。</p>
<p>柞蠶產於蓋平。岫巖。寛甸。安東各縣爲多。年產總額約二十三萬籠。價值一千五百萬元。内安東最多。約七萬籠。</p>
<p>果實收穫。民國十八年得一百六十萬貫。推定十年以後年可得二千萬貫。</p>
<p>其對於森林的推定。滿蒙林地占總地積三分之一强僅。鴨緣江右岸從頭道溝至二十四道溝其材木蓄積是尙有二億七千六百萬石。</p>
<p>最近調查滿蒙畜產統計、馬二百五十萬頭。牛二百萬頭。羊二百五十萬頭。騾六十二萬頭。其他不盡述。</p>
<p>我測此館設立之用意。（一）鼓舞日本人民經營滿蒙的野心。（二）對歐美人表示他們整理並經營滿蒙的能力。至於中國人對此發生何種感想。彼以爲不足注意了</p>
<p>我遊日本。至處車站。貼有滿蒙觀光團廣告。訂有减價優待方法。那個機關發起的呢。就是鐵道省。任何官吏辦公桌旁。必懸滿蒙地圖一大幅。他們是這様用心的呀。</p>

<h3>霍桑探案轉灣（一五）</h3>
<p>— 程小青</p>
<p>霍桑忽抬起頭來瞧着我問道。「他的臉兒怎様」我答道「臉兒是長形的下頷略見尖削。」霍桑的眼光忽的閃了一閃。彷彿他已得了什麽端倪他逼着問道。「他的臉上可有什麽特殊之點。你可也注意到麽」我聽了這句問句很得意的答道。「這一次我自信我的眼光不曾溺職。我覺得那人的臉上有兩個顯明的異點第一他的眼睛帶些兒稜角形。—「這時霍桑突的失聲呼道「哈那第二個異點不是他的鼻子尖端有些兒灣鈎麽。」這時候我假使不是坐在汽車裏面一定跳起身來。我不禁拊掌歡呼道。「着啊。你也瞧見他的麽」霍桑並不回答又接着問道「他的領結不是白地而有細小的藍星的麽。」我疑滯了一下答道「大概是的不過我不曾怎様仔細。」霍桑又道。「他臉上的白色。大半是雪花霜的成績。可不是麽。」　　我又點頭道。「正是。正是。」霍桑道。「近身時還有一股濃烈的香氣。」我忙着應道。「對啊。對啊。那再不會錯——」霍桑又很急促的接嘴道。」他的抺透了司丹康的頭髮。不是向後平梳的麽——唉。我錯了。這個你不會瞧見的。」我不禁舉起右掌。在他肩上拍一下。我呼道。「夠了。夠了。再也不會錯誤。這個人你可認識他麽。」我們的談話正在緊張的當兒。我的身子一震。汽車竟已停住。我探頭一瞧。這裏已是林蔭路。汽車正停在我的寓前。我下了汽車。便邀霍桑到我寓裏去略坐一坐。我在這個時候還殷勤延客。無非要結束我的問句。那是不容諱言的。霍桑忽辭謝道。「</p>
<p>對不起。我不能遵命了。我本應進去問問你夫人的貴恙。不過夜已深了。等明天來問候罷。」於是我在和他分手以前。不得不將我的最後的問句重新提出。霍桑搖頭道。「我不認識。他不過我在高家裏的時候。我的目光並不像你的那麽專注。確曾見過他的。可是在實際上也没有多大用處我的意思。我們要偵查這個人的下落。不妨從你的内姨身上着手。這一着祗能你去擔任。若有端倪。第二步的進行方法。我們再討論罷。」</p>

<h3>The People's Congress Decides on the Date of Promulgation of the Provisional Constitution</h3>
<p>Passes Resolutions on Granting Special Autonomy to Outer Mongolia, etc.</p>
<p>Telegraphs Cantonese Compatriots to Support Peaceful Unification</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Meeting</h3>
<p>Passed Seven Important Proposals and Two Telegram Drafts</p>
<p>Provisional Constitution to be Promulgated on June 1st</p>
<p>Emergency Motion to Telegraph Cantonese Compatriots</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Congress convened its seventh meeting at 8:30 AM on the 15th. 445 representatives and members of the Central National Government attended, with 53 observers. The presidium consisted of eight members: Yu Youren, Zhang Xueliang, Dai Chuanxian, Wu Tiecheng, Zhou Zuomin, Chen Lifu, Liu Chunyi, and Lin Zhifu. Zhang Xueliang presided.</p>
<h3>Reports</h3>
<p>(1) Reading of the minutes of the sixth meeting.</p>
<p>(2) Report by the Representative Qualification Committee, presented by convenor Wu Jingheng. The committee reported that since its first meeting, the congress had received successive registrations of representatives up to the 13th, which were still under review. A second review meeting was convened on the 13th, with 14 committee members present. The qualifications of the newly arrived representatives were reviewed and verified as complete and compliant.</p>
<p>(3) Document report: 14 congratulatory telegrams received.</p>
<p>(4) Representatives Zeng Youqi requested a two-hour leave, Zhu Guangmu a half-day leave, and Tian Kunshan a one-day leave.</p>
<p>(5) Dai Chuanxian reported that in the sixth meeting, concerning the program for industrial construction, representatives from the Southwest provinces requested the development of railway transportation in the Southwest. The congress approved an amendment to the program, stipulating that after the completion of the Yuehan Railway, the Chuanhan Railway would be constructed, and after the completion of the Longhai Railway, the Dianyue Railway would be constructed. This case has been submitted by the presidium to the National Government for record.</p>
<h3>Discussion Items</h3>
<p>(1) Regarding the Mongolian Education proposal (original proposal: The central government should allocate special funds and encourage the establishment of Mongolian education and various cultural undertakings). After an explanation by the proposer Wu Heling, there was little discussion. The presidium drafted a resolution: "The situation in Mongolia and Tibet is unique, with languages and scripts different from the interior. The National Government should, in accordance with the educational policy stipulated in the Provisional Constitution, consider the local situation and formulate appropriate measures to ensure the rapid development of Mongolian and Tibetan culture." The resolution was put to a vote and passed without objection.</p>
<p>(2) To notify domestic and foreign entities of the granting of special autonomy to Outer Mongolia, with the aim of achieving unification at an early date. After an explanation by the proposer Wu Heling, Peng Jiqun spoke, proposing a resolution on this case: "Regarding the local system of Mongolia, Article 10 of the Provisional Constitution clearly stipulates that it will be determined by law based on local conditions. This case should be submitted to the National Government as a reference for formulating laws." The chairman put this to a vote, and it passed without objection.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding maintaining the Mongolian League banner system (original proposal: To protect the Mongolian League banners and the livelihood of the Mongolian people). After an explanation by the proposer Wu Heling, Zhang Xueliang spoke in his capacity as a representative, saying that he came from the Northeast and was more familiar with the situation in Mongolia and Xinjiang. There were already regulations regarding encouraging cultivation in Mongolia and planning for the livelihood of the Mongolian people, but they were not well implemented, preventing the Mongolian people from benefiting. Moreover, in the Northeast, the Han and Mongolian ethnic groups often had misunderstandings due to differences in language, script, and customs, which easily affected politics. He hoped that people in the country would broaden their horizons</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>and unanimously regard developing the border regions as a key strategy for economic development and preventing covetousness. They should devote their efforts to management so that the cultural and economic undertakings and the livelihoods of the ethnic groups in Mongolia and Xinjiang could have the same level of development as the interior provinces. Subsequently, the presidium drafted a resolution: "Regarding the Mongolian League banner system, the 271st Central Political Conference has already decided on the principles and submitted them to the Legislative Yuan for prompt legislation. This case should be sent to the National Government and the Legislative Yuan as a reference for formulating the relevant laws, and it is hoped that the National Government will instruct the Legislative Yuan to promptly formulate these laws. As for the livelihood of the Mongolian people, the National Government should consider this proposal and devise appropriate measures." The resolution was put to a vote and passed without objection. (4) To urgently negotiate with the governments of various countries to abolish the harsh treatment of overseas Chinese, etc. After an explanation by the proposer Zheng Zhannan, Chen Zhaoqi spoke, first describing the suffering of overseas Chinese under harsh treatment, and then proposing two measures: (1) Request the government to instruct diplomatic authorities to telegraph their embassies and consulates to negotiate reasonably with local governments to abolish the harsh treatment. (2) Report the harsh treatment of overseas Chinese in various countries to the League of Nations and request assistance in abolishing it. Subsequently, Chen Xiexun and others also spoke. The chairman then announced that the presidium advocated passing the principle of this case and submitting it to the National Government. Those in favor should stand. The majority were in favor, and the motion passed.</p>
<p>A five-minute break was taken, and the meeting continued.</p>
<p>(5) Amendment to the proposal to establish a National Economic Commission, and another proposal to establish an economic conference to solve China's economic problems. The Economic Review Committee conducted a joint review and submitted a report (the report is recorded separately). It was resolved that the principle was passed, and the National Government was instructed to refer to the previously decided cases of the Central Political Conference for combined handling. The documents related to this case were also sent to the National Government for reference.</p>
<p>(6) Please use the full power of the state to provide relief to the three provinces of Gansu, Qinghai, and Ningxia, and develop the Northwest to carry out public works to seek construction and relieve the people from disaster. The two cases were discussed together. It was resolved that the proposals related to public works and construction in the Northwest provinces should be submitted to the National Government for overall planning and practical implementation.</p>
<p>(7) Chairman Jiang of the National Government requested the National Congress to decide on the date of promulgation of the Provisional Constitution. After consultation with the presidium, it was proposed to the congress for resolution: "The Provisional Constitution for the Period of Political Tutelage of the Republic of China will be promulgated and implemented on July 1, 1931." It was resolved to promulgate the Provisional Constitution on June 1st.</p>
<p>(8) The chairman read the draft telegram supporting peaceful unification, which was passed by the entire assembly.</p>
<p>(9) The chairman read the draft telegram warning Chen Jitang, which was passed by the entire assembly.</p>
<h3>Emergency Motion</h3>
<p>Representatives Zeng JiKuan and others proposed that the National Congress should telegraph revolutionary armed comrades in Guangdong, explaining the difference between right and wrong, and obedience and defiance, and that the National Congress should telegraph Guangdong compatriots to unanimously support peaceful unification and not be exploited by a small number of people. It was resolved to have the presidium draft the telegram.</p>
<p>The chairman announced that the eighth meeting would be held at 2:00 PM on the 16th.</p>
<p>The meeting adjourned at 12:15 PM.</p>

<h3>National Congress Announces to the Whole Country its Support for Peaceful Unification</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Congress issued a public announcement to the whole country supporting peaceful unification in a telegram. The text reads: "To all compatriots in the country: The foundation of our country's future lies in construction, and the prerequisite for construction is peaceful unification. Only by carrying out construction can we actively fulfill the responsibilities of a modern nation and resolve all current and future problems. Only by maintaining peace and unification can the construction plan not become empty talk on paper and be realized on schedule. Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the leader of the Kuomintang, led the entire nation in revolutionary efforts. Thirty years of struggle were based on this aim. After Dr. Sun's passing, his followers continued to work hard, inheriting his teachings. They destroyed the power of the warlords to complete the unification of the country and, in recent years, quelled rebellions and removed obstacles, establishing a strong central government for the entire nation and laying the foundation for the country for millions of generations. This achievement is the highest expression of public opinion and must be safeguarded with the greatest determination and effort. In the past, when warlords stole power and the central authority was lost, our entire nation unanimously felt the importance of peaceful unification, but ultimately, due to the lack of leadership, we could not encourage ourselves to strive for the early settlement of national affairs. Now that the Kuomintang has inherited the Prime Minister's ideology and is shouldering the heavy responsibility of construction and completing the great cause of unification for our entire nation, our entire nation should remember the countless heads and blood shed by the revolutionary martyrs and that the construction of the country is still far from the ideal state. We should know that future national affairs will not succeed unless all of our people unite under the banner of the Three People's Principles and work together. The method of this joint effort is, first and foremost, to support peace and unification. The Provisional Constitution for the Period of Political Tutelage has already been formulated by this congress. Hereafter, all national affairs should follow common norms and be resolved in accordance with the fundamental law, and no recourse to any force outside the law will be permitted. The Republic of China will forever be a unified republic, as clearly stipulated in the Provisional Constitution. Therefore, anyone who uses forces outside the law to undermine peace and unification is an enemy of the entire nation. This congress dares to represent the entire nation in announcing to China and the world that from now on, any individual or group that seeks to undermine peace and unification, whether passively or actively, is a traitor who violates the fundamental law of the country. If the National Government unfortunately sees the occurrence of such a situation, it should exercise the power granted by the entire nation and use the most expeditious and appropriate methods to implement strict sanctions to protect the interests of the country. At this time of founding the nation, our entire nation should be of one mind and support the government so that national construction can be realized and the foundation of the country can be permanently secured. This is the telegram. (Issued by the National Congress). (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<h3>Telegram Warning Chen Jitang</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Congress sent a telegram to Chen Jitang and others: "To Commander-in-Chief Chen of the 8th Route Army in Guangzhou, Commander Xiang, Commander Yu Hanmou, and Commander Li Yangjing: The representatives of the National Congress are gathering in the capital to determine the long-term peace and stability of the country, but you suddenly sent a telegram like the 'Jiang Ri' telegram, picking up the untrue accusations of the four supervisors Deng, Lin, Xiao, and Gu, and arbitrarily attacking party and government measures. Roadside rumors even say that you are mobilizing troops, seemingly with other plans. This Congress is extremely shocked. You are a member of the party and bear important military responsibilities. In terms of party discipline, all issues within the party should be resolved by the highest party organs. All party members can only obey the party's decisions and are not allowed to disrupt the system and act on their own. In terms of national discipline, soldiers have an absolute duty to obey. Without orders from superiors, they must not move troops without authorization, and even less should they overstep their authority and arbitrarily speak on national politics. Historically, warlords who initiated chaos always used military training as a pretext, but in the end, they were abandoned by public opinion and perished one after another. From Li Bai, Zhang Tang, to Yan Feng, the past is clear and serves as a warning. Peaceful unification was the request of the Prime Minister on his deathbed and the unanimous desire of the people of the whole country. For several years, the central government has been suppressing chaos and reversing setbacks, not resting day or night, spending countless sacrifices and huge costs, just to achieve this day of peace. How can any individual be allowed to undermine it? Moreover, the atmosphere of rebellion has not yet subsided, and campaigns are in full swing. The exhausted people urgently need relief. If you have any love for the country and concern for the people, you should remember this achievement, which is like building a nine-fathom tower with one basket of earth. How can you disrupt your own steps, allowing the stubborn bandits to hear the news and become even more rampant? Public opinion and national righteousness are very clear in their direction. You are now making a big fuss, forgetting the warning against overstepping your authority and shocking the world's attention. It is as if you have no love for the glorious revolutionary history of the past, nor do you cherish the foundation of peace in the country. What could be more ominous than this? This Congress follows the Prime Minister's teachings and affirms that the country's military force should protect the interests of the people, and the needs of the people must be guaranteed by strict laws and disciplines. We cannot sit idly by and watch the laws and disciplines be undermined, nor can we bear to see you destroy your reputation and bring disaster to the country. Therefore, we formally resolve to represent the national will and send you a solemn warning. The judgment of public opinion is related to both fortune and misfortune. We hope you will be mindful of the danger on the precipice and avoid the regret of biting your navel. What to do and what to choose is up to you to reflect on the country. (Deleted by the National Congress). (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<h3>Report of the Economic Review Committee</h3>
<p>Proposal to Establish a National Economic Commission</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Economic Review Committee reported: "Upon receiving the proposal to establish a National Economic Commission from the congress, we convened a meeting on the 14th to review it. Forty-nine people attended. After summarizing the opinions of the review committee members, we believe that the National Economic Commission is indeed necessary to establish as soon as possible. However, there are slight amendments to the content and methods of this proposal. The amended text is attached below. Is it appropriate? Please decide." Convener of the Economic Review Committee, Jin Enqi.</p>
<p>(1) The first item of the rationale is amended as follows: "(1) Gathering representatives of national professional groups, government agency personnel, and specialists together, holding regular annual meetings to decide on various practical plans for national economic improvement and economic facilities, for the government to adopt and implement, can achieve the effect of unified national improvement of people's livelihood."</p>
<p>(2) The second item of the rationale is amended as follows: "(2) It can enable all sectors of the country to pay attention to the solution of people's livelihood problems, which is the key to solving China's problems, and not to be manipulated by someone's words or attitudes, each for their own private interests, each not planning for the other, until they are all harmed."</p>
<p>(3) The fifth item of the rationale is amended as follows: "(5) China's soldier-bandit problem is a most serious livelihood problem, which should be solved with the strength of the whole country. It is impossible to talk emptily about disarmament and simply blame the government. Therefore, if the government appoints military personnel to participate in the Economic Commission and meet with representatives from all sectors, it can eliminate mutual estrangement and promote the solution of the soldier-bandit problem."</p>
<p>(4) The entire text of the methods is amended as follows: (The first item of the methods adds a second item according to the original proposal, and the remaining items are merged and amended into the third item.)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Briand Goes to Geneva</h3>
<p>In countries with a parliamentary system, the key lies in the cabinet. If the cabinet is competent, it will harmonize with the parliament internally and cooperate with friendly nations externally. Only then can the country's position be consolidated. Although the president sits majestically on top, in reality, their influence is not as significant as that of a key figure in the cabinet. However, people are often dazzled by the president's superficial glory and exhaust the strength of their party and faction to compete for the position. No one has ever willingly given it up. However, in the recent French presidential election, the left wing wanted to maintain Foreign Minister Briand's position and allow him to continue his long-standing foreign policy. Therefore, they used secret ballots to defeat him. But Briand did not resign in disappointment due to the defeat. Now he is resolutely going to Geneva to deal with the League of Nations meeting. This also shows that people's thinking has advanced to reality and is not obsessed with the president's superficial glory. Today, France's position in foreign affairs is most important. Major issues concerning international relations and world security are now awaiting resolution at the Geneva Conference, and the direction of France's foreign policy is particularly crucial. Therefore, after the results of this election were announced, representatives from various countries participating in the parliament focused on Briand's actions. Those who previously expressed sympathy for Briand's foreign policy all praised him for not being concerned about personal gains and losses and for being worthy of a great political figure. We observe the current world situation, and Briand's departure or stay is indeed very important to the future of the European situation. The French political parties are willing to sacrifice the most honorable presidential title to implement their foreign policy, which is truly commendable among today's political parties.</p>

<h3>National Press Circle Hosts a Banquet for National Congress Representatives</h3>
<p>Pan Gongbi Delivers Welcome Speech</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The national press circle held a banquet at the Central Gymnasium (National Congress Representatives Banquet Hall) at 6 PM on the afternoon of the 15th to welcome all the representatives of the National Congress, members of the Central Committee, and members of the National Government, totaling more than 300 people. Chairman Pan Gongbi delivered a welcome speech. Shao YuanChong, Liu Luyin, and representative Yan Hongzhu all gave sincere speeches. Pan Gongbi's speech is as follows:</p>
<p>"Colleagues in the press circle sincerely welcome all the gentlemen attending the National Congress. Colleagues in the press circle in Nanjing have been admiring your style and listening to your high-level discussions in the National Congress for days. We are deeply pleased to have you gather here tonight despite your busy schedules. The National Congress has been convened for exactly ten days. In these ten days, you have passed the Provisional Constitution for the Period of Political Tutelage, declared the abolition of unequal treaties, and decided on various major policy plans, making great contributions to the country and the people. You gentlemen are national representatives, and my colleagues dare not claim to be representatives of the people to thank you. But my colleagues are also citizens, and how can we not express our deep gratitude? You come from overseas, from Mongolia and Tibet, from various provinces and cities. Although the title of representative you hold is only temporary, the reason why you were elected as representatives must be because your talents, virtues, and integrity are admired by all. Those who are admired by all, even without a title, are in fact leaders of society. Therefore, my colleagues hope that your role as representatives of the National Congress is important and great, but we hope that your role as social leaders is even further and more important. My colleagues in the press circle select materials and discuss matters from different perspectives, seeing benevolence and wisdom, and our views are not entirely the same. But there are two points on which we are consistent. First, we hope for peace and unification, and we believe that peace and unification must be consolidated by the strong power of the people. Looking at the strong and prosperous countries of modern times, they have not had internal strife for a long time, which is enviable. Is this because of the wisdom of their governments, or because of the strong power of the people? If it is said that it is because of the wisdom of the government, is it accidental, fate, or is it because the people have the power to prevent the existence of an unwise government? Looking at the endless internal strife in our country, is it not lamentable? However, from the perspective of the people, who does not hate chaos? Despite the hatred of chaos, the chaos continues, is it not because the people who hate chaos have no power at all? My colleagues firmly believe that the National Government has the power to quell chaos, but what the people seek is definitely not quelling chaos, but no chaos. The method to seek no chaos is definitely not for the government and army to suppress the whole country, but for the people to have a strong power at any time and any place, so that chaos cannot occur. In other words, those who want to create chaos are afraid of the power of the people and dare not create chaos, until they do not want to create chaos. Therefore, it is said that peace and unification must begin with increasing the power of the people. On this point, my colleagues feel that we have the responsibility to promote and publicize it, while the actual work of increasing the power of the people is still up to you gentlemen. This is the first belief of my colleagues and the first wish for you. Second, my colleagues believe that in principle, it is difficult for the government to satisfy everyone. This is the same in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad. In fact, the achievements of today's National Government are also difficult to satisfy everyone. However, my colleagues consider the oppression of the international community, the lessons of history, the difficulties of the country, and the exhaustion of people's livelihood, and deeply feel that the National Government is worthy of support and must be supported, and supported for the sake of the people, not for the sake of the government. My colleagues believe that supporting the government from the perspective of the press is definitely not blind praise, but is based on well-intentioned criticism to promote the functions of governments at all levels. This is the most appropriate and effective method of support. Because the government has the greatest functions, it is the most solid government. This is the second belief of my colleagues, and it is your responsibility to practically assist the functions of governments at all levels. This is the second wish of my colleagues for you. People regard public opinion as the representative of the people. My colleagues dare not be self-deprecating, and often regard ourselves as the representatives of the people. Tonight, we are meeting the representatives elected by the people in the capital, and we cannot help but feel inferior. However, my colleagues consider the basis for the existence of public opinion and the mission that public opinion bears, and we will still say what the people want to say and say what the people should say, and claim to be representatives of the people. Are we representing the people, or are you representing the people? Although the nature and position are different, at least all those present are great citizens of the great Republic of China. The two points mentioned above are the responsibility of my colleagues, the responsibility of you gentlemen, and what is not the responsibility of the people? Increasing the power of the people also depends on the guidance and encouragement of the government, and assisting the functions of the government also depends on the government's openness and tolerance. This is especially hoped for the members of the Central Committee and the members of the National Government present today. I respectfully offer you a glass of wine, and let us all drink it."</p>
<h3>Important Proposal Contents: Case to Cancel Harsh Treatment of Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Zheng Zhan-nan and 54 others propose urgently negotiating with various countries' governments to cancel harsh treatment of overseas Chinese. Measures: (1) Whenever various countries' governments promulgate various harsh treatment regulations against overseas Chinese, the government should earnestly negotiate for their cancellation. (2) For countries whose governments have not yet signed treaties with China, treaties of equality and mutual benefit should be promptly established to allow overseas Chinese to develop freely under treaty protections. (3) The government should carefully select consular appointees stationed in various regions in the future, appointing those with suitable talents, enabling them to argue based on reason against the harsh treatment regulations promulgated by various governments. For consuls already dispatched who cannot seek benefits for overseas Chinese and are opposed by overseas Chinese, the government should immediately recall them and appoint replacements.

<h3>Developing the Northwest and Handling Relief Through Labor</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Li Fan-yi and 68 others propose developing the Northwest and handling relief through labor to seek construction and rescue the people from disaster. Measures: (A) The focus of this case is on developing the Northwest, and</p>
<h2>Page 9</h2>
<h3>Receiving Important Domestic Telegrams</h3>
<p>to use the capital for developing the Northwest to organize relief through labor. In other words, it means utilizing disaster victims in the Northwest to engage in Northwest construction. (B) It is found that the consumption of cigarettes has become a huge drain on the country. Young men and women arbitrarily smoke, which harms the nation's health and corrupts national morality. The harm cannot be overstated. According to precise statistics, the national consumption of cigarettes alone amounts to a staggering 200 million yuan annually. It is proposed that this conference inform the National Government and instruct the Ministry of Finance to increase the current tax rate by 30 percent, which would yield 60 million yuan. This would be used as a fund to issue 60 million yuan in public bonds for national disaster relief, with 30 million yuan allocated specifically for developing the Northwest. This fund would be used to organize beneficial relief through labor, combining prohibition with taxation. This would not only curb the decadent habits of young people but also be used for productive construction, achieving two goals with one move, and nothing could be better than this. As for cigarette tax rates, the amounts levied in other countries are excessive. Even with our country's increase, it is still far from the tax rates of other countries. Contemporary scholars have discussed this in great detail, so there is no need to elaborate further.</p>
<h3>Establishing Mongolian Education Programs</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Wu He-ling and 182 others propose that the central government allocate special funds and encourage the establishment of Mongolian education and various cultural undertakings. Measures: (1) The central government should allocate special funds and actively establish Mongolian education according to the established plan. (2) The central government should formulate reward measures to encourage Mongolians to independently establish education and various cultural undertakings. (Fifteenth Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Guaranteeing Mongolian Leagues and Banners</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Wu He-ling and 180 others propose guaranteeing Mongolian leagues and banners and the livelihood of Mongolians. Measures: (1) The governing rights of all Mongolian leagues and banners should remain as before. (2) Land in Mongolia unsuitable for cultivation should remain as pastures for Mongolians, and the central government should encourage the improvement of animal husbandry. Land suitable for cultivation should, when cultivated, first provide Mongolians with ample land for their livelihood and public school land. (Fifteenth Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Relieving the Three Provinces of Gansu, Qinghai, and Ningxia</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Ma Fu-xiang and 149 others propose that the nation use its full strength to relieve the three provinces of Gansu, Qinghai, and Ningxia. The original text is as follows: Since unification was achieved and military affairs concluded, those who seek long-term stability and peace for the Party and the nation all say, "Develop the Northwest, manage the Northwest." Among the most powerful proposals is "Move troops to populate the border," which is a fundamental plan for consolidating national defense. From a superficial perspective, it seems to be well-founded and logically sound. However, after studying the actual situation of the three provinces, it is best to start with the economic construction of the three provinces, which is easy to implement quickly, achieving twice the results with half the effort. The government spends a limited amount, and the people benefit immensely. Specific relief measures are proposed, which are also the initial steps in the Northwest development plan. (1) The Baoning Railway should be completed ahead of schedule to facilitate transportation. Measure: Instruct the Ministry of Railways to complete it by a set deadline. (2) The aviation routes in Gansu, Qinghai, and Ningxia should be developed ahead of schedule. Measure: Instruct the Ministry of Communications to open air routes in Gansu, Qinghai, and Ningxia in the shortest possible time and to equip aircraft to facilitate civil aviation. (3) Developing water conservancy in the upper reaches of the Yellow River to avoid floods in the lower reaches of Henan and Shandong provinces. Large-scale measures should be taken in Ningxia and the Hetao region to dig canals and divert the river for irrigation. Measure: Request the government to designate special funds and instruct the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission to implement it by a set deadline. At a minimum, it should be planned and considered concurrently with the Huai River diversion project to achieve effective results. (4) Improve animal husbandry, agriculture, and forestry in Gansu, Qinghai, and Ningxia to enrich the people's livelihood. Measure: Instruct the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to use its full strength to develop water conservancy in the three provinces ahead of schedule, encourage afforestation, protect forests, develop animal husbandry, improve breeds of horses, cattle, and sheep, exploit mineral resources, and use local raw materials to establish factories. (5) Education in Gansu, Qinghai, and Ningxia should receive special attention to achieve universal education. Measure: Instruct the Ministry of Education to stipulate local education funding for the three provinces and, given the special circumstances of the three provinces, request special subsidies from the central government or designate special funds for education in the three provinces from the Boxer Indemnity funds to ensure practical implementation. (Fifteenth Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Establishing an Economic Conference</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) He Yu-fang and 54 others propose establishing an economic conference to resolve China's economic problems. (Measures) (1) The German Economic Council has a special clause in its constitution. Since China's constitution has not yet been established, it is advisable to formulate a special Economic Council Law or stipulate it first in the provisional constitution to include it in the constitution in the future and to serve as the basis for organizing the Economic Council now. (2) After Germany promulgated its constitution, it immediately began drafting laws for the organization of the Economic Council. Due to the urgency, it first promulgated the Provisional Economic Council Organization Law to convene it by a set deadline. China's economic problems urgently need to be resolved, so it is also advisable to first promulgate a type of Provisional Economic Council Law to meet the needs and facilitate convening. (3) The points that should be noted in the establishment of the Economic Council are that the mechanism for resolving economic problems must be independent, and the people resolving economic problems must be average in terms of occupation and even more so in terms of individuals. Based on these two points as the goal of organizing the Economic Council, the laws and resolutions passed by the council will have an independent spirit, and the various groups and classes gathered by the council will have opportunities for coordination. In this way, the tragedy of class struggle can be avoided, and international economic survival can be adapted.</p>
<h3>Special Authorization for Outer Mongolian Autonomy</h3>
<p>Wu He-ling's Proposal</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wu He-ling and 173 others propose announcing to the country and abroad the special authorization for Outer Mongolian autonomy to achieve unification as soon as possible. Reasons and measures: Outer Mongolia is a part of China's territory, which has long been recognized by the world. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, the addition of new troops in Outer Mongolia caused suspicion among the Mongolians. Taking advantage of the Wuchang Uprising, they declared independence. By the fourth year of the Republic of China, considering the generous treatment of Inner Mongolia by the central government, they cancelled their independence and changed to autonomy, recognizing China's suzerainty and that Outer Mongolia was still China's territory. If the covenant had not been violated, it could have been a long-term solution. However, in the ninth year of the Republic of China, Xu Shu-zheng forcibly cancelled Outer Mongolian autonomy by deploying troops, which led to a reaction from Outer Mongolian officials and civilians and a declaration of a second independence. Since returning and leaving again and again, the enthusiasm of the people for their homeland has changed from hope to a mentality of turning away and leaving for good. The Soviet Russian imperialists took advantage of this weakness to spread their communist heresies, ultimately creating today's dangerous situation. The knowledgeable people of Outer Mongolia are not unaware that drinking poison will kill them, but to quench their immediate thirst, they have no choice but to endure bitterness. Although the ultimate goal of Soviet Russia is to swallow Outer Mongolia, its propaganda and measures all cater to the extreme ideas of Mongolian youth to sell their deceit, such as publicizing and guiding the establishment of an independent republic in Mongolia, sending Inner Mongolian students to study in Europe and America, providing military supplies to strengthen armaments, supplying machinery to establish various industries, and dispatching teachers to instill communist doctrines. At the same time, they vigorously publicize China's harsh treatment of Mongolia to provoke them. All of these are things that Mongolian youth are very happy to hear and very willing to promote. Once someone comes forward to assist them, how can they not regard it as kindness and be anesthetized by it? Although Soviet Russia's influence in Outer Mongolia is not yet fully consolidated, in recent years, it has greatly moved towards Inner Mongolia, such as directing Mongolian soldiers to plunder Inner Mongolian livestock, dispatching party members to Inner Mongolia to instigate and recruit young people to study in Outer Mongolia. If this continues unchecked, then in a few years, not only will the relationship between Soviet Russia and Outer Mongolia become closer and more difficult to eradicate, but also the various leagues and banners of Inner Mongolia, bordering the provinces, will inevitably lead to an unquenchable disaster due to the outward development of Russian and Mongolian violence. Moreover, the property and goods of Chinese businessmen in Outer Mongolia have now been confiscated, and calls for help are endless. People fleeing from Outer Mongolia describe the cruelty of communism and their earnest hope for China. However, because they do not know how China will treat them, they dare not return rashly. The situation is particularly heartbreaking to hear. At this time, when the National Assembly is jointly planning unification and construction, we cannot but urgently seek a proper solution to this major problem of hidden worries. After repeated consideration, the representatives believe that the reason why the people of Outer Mongolia are hesitant is partly due to Soviet Russia's misrepresentations and partly due to their doubts about our government. The urgent task now is to uphold our Party's advocacy of supporting small and weak nations to enable them to self-determine and self-govern, to grant Outer Mongolia autonomy, and to have the National Government stipulate support measures and announce them to China and abroad to show great faith. Then, based on this principle, engage in propaganda, so that the people of Outer Mongolia who love their motherland can return with peace of mind, and those anesthetized youths will also become aware of it due to the trend of the majority. In this way, through gradual management, the already missing territory can be restored to completeness. Otherwise, we are nurturing disaster and leaving endless troubles. The representatives come from Mongolia and have more accurate observations. We respectfully offer our humble suggestions and respectfully request a public decision. (Fifteenth Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Continuing Yesterday's Resolution on Suppressing Bandits</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Fourth, producers in rural and urban areas must seek mutual benefit within the scope of legal protection based on the principle of labor-capital mutual assistance and coordination. The Red bandits, under the direction of red imperialists, are dedicated to destroying our country's rural and urban economies. Therefore, they lure farmers with slogans such as resisting rent and taxes and confiscating land, causing them to constantly engage in cruel struggles of murder and arson. They lure workers with slogans such as increasing wages, reducing working hours, and improving treatment, causing them to constantly engage in daily struggles that exceed the scope. The result of these two struggles is that, in reality, both the rural economy and the urban economy are in a state of bankruptcy, and the farmers and workers they utilize will also perish due to unemployment and displacement. The people of our country, especially the farmers and workers of our country, should know that the theories boasted by the Red bandits are completely unsuitable for China's actual economic situation. As far as the rural economy is concerned, the central theory boasted by the Red bandits is the land revolution, and the content of the land revolution is to equally divide the land. However, they do not know that China's land system was originally very equal. According to statistics in recent years, farmers with 10 to 20 mu of land account for 62% of the total cultivated land in the country, those with 30 mu or more account for 21%, those with 50 mu or more account for 11%, and those with 100 mu or more account for about 6%. It can be seen that the distribution of land in China is already so equal. At the same time, the changing state of land ownership of farmers with 10 to 50 mu of land has a tendency to increase, while the changing state of land ownership of farmers with 50 to 100 mu or more has only a trend of division and no trend of concentration. It can be seen that the change in land distribution in China still does not exceed its scope of equal balance. Therefore, it is clear that the Red bandits' theory of equally dividing land is not applicable to China. Moreover, the so-called equal division of land by the Red bandits, although superficially claiming to equally divide it according to population, in fact, they neither count the population nor count the land. How can they equally divide it? Even if there are local statistics, the population density of the country is different, and the breadth and fertility of the land are very different. How can the bandits equally divide it? If it is equally divided according to the population, it will inevitably lead to those who can cultivate the land having no land to use, and those who cannot cultivate the land having no people to use. Seeking equality in this way will result in the opposite. From this, it can be seen that the fallacies used by the Red bandits to incite farmers have been refuted in fact. Furthermore, in terms of the urban economy, our country's production is backward, and the capitalist system has not yet been formed. To deal with the powerful Western capitalist methods, adding them to the weak investors will not only destroy the production enterprises that are just beginning, but also cut off the lifeline of the workers themselves. This is a fact that the Red bandits have repeatedly tried and tested since the Wuhan terror era in the fifteenth year, without waiting for any other evidence. In recent years, workers have also known that economic struggles are enough to increase their own suffering, so they no longer believe in the fallacy of striking at every turn. The Red bandits have seen this psychology of their fellow countrymen, so they have changed their methods of incitement and advanced with the tactic of slowing down work. However, no matter how the Red bandits change their methods of inciting workers, the result is still to destroy our country's production enterprises, and the result is still that workers themselves will never have any improvement in their welfare. At the same time, because Chinese workers misuse economic struggles for the production enterprises of their own country, any large-scale production in their own country cannot be revitalized. As a result, foreign industries backed by strong Western capitalism are able to take advantage of the situation to invade China's territory. This phenomenon is particularly evident in Shanghai. From this, it can be seen that another result of Chinese workers' believing in economic struggles is to promote the transplantation of foreign capitalism into China. Therefore, the theories and methods relied upon by the Red bandits to deceive the workers of our country, once tried and used, will ultimately result in three kinds of disasters: first, the elimination of our country's production; second, the increase of unemployment among workers in our country; and third, the promotion of the invasion of foreign capitalism. In the eyes of the red imperialists, they have been seeking these disasters that harm China's economic life day and night, but why are a few workers in our country willing to be tigers and not realize it? To sum up the theories and methods of the red imperialists' instigating their bandits to lure farmers and workers, their intention is to destroy our country's rural and urban economies. It is obvious that from now on, the farmers and workers of our country must thoroughly understand that this method of the Red bandits, which destroys social and economic life, is inappropriate. They must each follow the principle of labor-capital mutual assistance and coordination to engage in increasing production and improving production skills. Only by striving to increase production can production enterprises continue to develop, only by the continuous development of production enterprises can the interests of farmers and workers continue to increase, their lives can continue to improve, and their skills can continue to improve. If they do the opposite and do not strive to increase production, but seek to increase benefits, improve their lives, and improve their skills, there will be no escape from the situation where labor and capital perish together. Now, the principle of labor-capital mutual coordination has been established as one of the fundamental policies of the national economy, and the state is also based on this principle, formulating various laws and regulations to protect the interests of farmers and workers, in the hope that all the people involved in production enterprises in the country will jointly implement it in the future. This is not only the direction that must be taken to develop the national economy, but also the means to reverse the bad habits of those who have been misled by the Red bandits. This is another important meaning of our people's assisting the government in suppressing the disasters of the Red bandits in accordance with the principle of labor-capital mutual assistance and coordination within the scope of the law to seek the mutual benefits of both parties.

<h3>He Yingqin Responds to Long Yun's Telegram</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) In addition to jointly issuing a telegram denouncing Chen Gutong, He Yingqin and 25 other generals also responded to Long Yun, Chairman of Yunnan Province, expressing their support for Yu Dian's proposal. The telegram reads: "It is a pleasure to read Yu Dian, and we admire it so much. At this time, after the rebels have been pacified and the communist bandits are rampant, all comrades in our Party are excited to plan for governance and strive to build up after the destruction, lay the foundation for the country, establish the cause of lasting prosperity, and complete the unfinished ambition of the Premier. However, Deng Zeru, Gu Yingfen, Chen Jitang and others, at the beginning of the National Assembly, which the whole country hopes to govern, dare to use empty words and sectarianism to reverse right and wrong and arbitrarily issue telegrams, not hesitating to indulge in their own foolish anger, hoping to provoke internal strife and destroy the established situation. This is no different from creating opportunities for the communist bandits and digging graves for the people, harming the country and ruining the people. There is nothing more so. If we do not denounce it, the momentum will not stop until the financial resources are exhausted, the country is destroyed, and the family is destroyed. The brothers are loyal to the Party and the country, and their sincerity is unparalleled. Those who dare to be the head of the army, harm the country, and destroy the people's livelihood will be vowed to rise up and cut them down to maintain the peaceful situation and avoid the misery of destruction.

<h3>People in Guangzhou are Uneasy</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Guangzhou information obtained by foreign consulates can be summarized as follows: (1) Humen Fortress suddenly fired a cannon towards Guangzhou yesterday, but it was not live ammunition, but it caused the people of Guangzhou to shake, and those who moved to other places were constantly on the road. (2) The navy in the East Dongjiang and Guangzhou areas completely obeyed the government. The Guangdong authorities sent personnel to lobby and demanded a million yuan in military pay to maintain neutrality, but it was not completed. (3) The gunshots in Guangzhou City the night before were caused by a battalion commander and a staff officer of Chen Jitang's troops arguing over a prostitute, and both sides fired guns, killing one battalion commander. (4) Although the Guangxi army was ordered to deploy to the Hunan border, and the Guangdong army was prepared to prevent the Jiangxi border, the progress was very slow. (5) Paper money is not used in all cities and towns in Guangdong, and all purchases must be made in cash. However, large amounts of money from the private sector can still be exchanged through the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications. (6) Chen Jitang is recruiting soldiers in seven counties in Guangzhou, but few have responded. (7) Many people speculate that the remaining warlords of Guangdong and Guangxi will resort to any means to unite with the communist bandits in Hunan and Jiangxi. If so, the government army can soon defeat them one by one. (Fifteenth Dispatch)</p>

Therefore, the discussion was not public. At today's meeting, German Foreign Minister Curtius had lengthy talks with British Foreign Secretary Henderson, followed by Italian Foreign Secretary Grandi. However, the Soviet Russian representative will not arrive until late tonight, so the formal discussion of economic issues will be at the earliest tomorrow afternoon.

At that time, in order to prevent the continued decline of the Spanish currency, anyone who secretly transported money abroad was severely punished.

A special committee has been established and will continue to discuss this matter tomorrow.</p>
<h3>British Airship Policy Changes Financial Policy</h3>
<p>Conservatives Propose Amendments</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 14th: British Prime Minister MacDonald stated in the House of Commons today that British airship policy and procedures must be completely changed after the R-101 accident. No more airships will be built, and the existing R-100 will be converted into a test airship, because there are various unresolved problems that still need to be studied. However, it will not be used for long-distance flights. The funding for maintaining and researching this ship will be 120,000 pounds in the first year, 130,000 pounds in the second and third years, and at most 140,000 pounds. After three or four years, a plan will be determined. If three years of research show the government that maintaining this ship is useless, it will be abandoned. If it is found that the future of airships is very promising, it will be expanded. Conservative Hoare said that airships may be very beneficial to the British Empire in the future, so the research and testing work that has been carried out for five years should not be terminated. Liberal Simon also supported the Prime Minister's proposal.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 14th: The Conservative Party has proposed an amendment in the House of Commons, disagreeing with the Snowden budget bill scheduled for a second reading on May 19th. The most opposed is the proposal to levy land tax.</p>

All Chinese people are deeply shocked and puzzled. We later learned that Mr. Cai Zimin and other members of the Central Supervisory Committee had already sent a telegram to correct them, hoping that Deng Zeru and others would soon feel ashamed and repent. However, Cantonese generals Chen Jitang and others, oblivious to the greater good, again sent a Jiang telegram. The call for safeguarding peace and unity is at its height, but their inferior nature of fomenting chaos has resurfaced. This kind of behavior is not only forbidden by Party discipline and national law, but also intolerable to the public and reason. Moreover, the fierce flames of the Red bandits have not yet been quelled. Anyone with a conscience thinks of uniting as one to overcome the difficulties together. How can we allow madmen with lost hearts and minds to spread rumors and advocate chaos, willingly creating opportunities for the Red bandits? Thinking of this, we are filled with worry and indignation. Your esteemed assembly is a group representing the public will of the people, and you are deeply concerned about the national economy and the people's livelihood. Therefore, we respectfully request that you swiftly correct the erroneous statements in the telegram from Deng Zeru and others to maintain discipline and rectify public opinion. We await your orders with utmost anticipation. We sincerely hope that all compatriots and comrades of the Party will unite in advocating this. We remain, the Provisional Reorganization Committee of the Hankou Special Municipality Party Headquarters of the Chinese Kuomintang, respectfully, Yuan Yin.</p>
<p>Telegram from Anqing Addressed to all Newspapers for their perusal: We have just replied to Director He Jingzhi et al. with the following telegram: Upon reading your sincere telegram, we deeply admire your righteous and stern advice to the Cantonese Chen. We are currently following the teachings of the late Premier to realize the National Conference. The whole country, from top to bottom, should sincerely support and implement the resolutions. Internally, we should strictly abide by the provisional constitution and promote the progress of political tutelage. Externally, we should revise treaties and strive for international equality. How can we hold private opinions and rashly start disputes? Moreover, the people are tired of chaos and yearn for peace, and the Red calamity is rampant and urgently needs to be suppressed. We should not be used by others and willingly become leaders of bandits, plunging the Republic into danger and acting as pioneers for the Red bandits. If Bo Nan truly has the country at heart, he will be able to follow our sincere advice, repent and reform, eliminate discord, and establish harmony. Diao Yuan et al. are loyal to the Party and the country, and our duty is to defend, conquer, and quell the chaos. We will only follow the orders of the Central Government. If it benefits the country, we will not hesitate. We hope that the leaders of the Party and the government, our comrades in the army, and all compatriots nationwide will rise up together and work together to stop the source of chaos. It would be fortunate for the Party and the country. Chen Diaoyuan, Fan Xiji, Yue Shengxuan, Ruan Zhaochang, Liang Hongen, respectfully, Yuan.</p>

<h3>Recent Financial Situation in Guangdong Province</h3>
<p>Tax Revenue Collected in Cash Starting in May</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Since the Central Bank suspended convertibility in Guangdong Province, the market price of banknotes is currently about 80% of cash. The daily opening prices for buying and selling at silver shops also fluctuate between 79% and 80%. Yang Jianping, the Deputy Governor of the Central Bank, has resigned, and Huang Guanzhang has been sent by the head office to replace him. However, since the Central Bank suspended convertibility, its branches in various regions have also announced suspension of convertibility. Therefore, the Central Bank's business has been very quiet recently. It is rumored that the bank still has more than one million yuan in funds. Fan Qiwu, the Director of the Finance Department, has resigned and is temporarily replaced by Lin Yungai, a member of the Provincial Committee. Lin took over affairs at the Finance Department on the 11th. Starting on May 1st, tax revenues in Guangdong Province have been converted to collection in silver coins, according to the following methods for revenue and expenditure: (A) Revenue: (1) Starting on May 1st, all tax revenues in the province that were originally collected in Central Bank banknotes will be collected in full cash. The four prefectures of Chaozhou, Meizhou, Qinzhou, and Lianzhou, which previously collected land name bonds, will continue to collect land name bonds without any changes. However, if the land name bonds have been announced to be non-convertible, they will also be collected in full cash. (2) Before May 1st (i.e., up to the end of April), the Central Bank banknotes collected by various counties and authorized collection agencies should be verified by May 15th. The amounts, along with the revenue statements and receipt stubs, should be reported for verification and then deposited into the treasury. Failure to do so will result in a penalty of silver coins. The amount of funds contracted by the merchants and companies that are based on silver coins should be collected in cash, whether it is salary owed before the end of April or new salary after May. They should not use Central Bank banknotes to settle the debt. (B) Expenditure: (1) The expenses of various agencies, whether regular, temporary, or commission fees, will be paid in full cash starting on May 1st. For expenses incurred before April, except for military expenses and those specifically approved to be paid in silver coins, whether payment orders have been issued or not, will be paid in Central Bank banknotes. (2) The four prefectures of Chaozhou, Meizhou, Qinzhou, and Lianzhou, which previously paid with land name bonds, will continue to pay as before without any changes. However, if the land name bonds have been announced to be non-convertible, the first method should still be applied. (3) The principal and interest of financial treasury bonds will continue to be paid with Central Bank banknotes starting on May 1st. The remaining silver coins will be used to consolidate the Central Bank's funds. (May 12th)</p>
<h3>Jiaoji Railway Decides to Extend the Route</h3>
<p>Extending Westward from Jinan</p>
<p>Surveyed in Eight Lines</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: The Jiaoji Railway Bureau previously considered that the entire line was only over 400 kilometers long, limiting the absorption of merchants and goods to the eastern part of Shandong Province. Inter-station transportation was limited to the Jinpu line. In order to make full use of the superior location of Qingdao Port, develop railway business, and increase passenger and freight revenue, it was proposed to extend the existing line westward from Jinan, so that it would be close to the Grand Canal and further connect with the Pinghan line. This would allow all goods from north and south of the Yellow River and east and west of the Grand Canal to be directly exported through the Jiaoji Railway, benefiting the sale of local products and increasing the railway's economy. The first line would extend from Jinan to Linqing. The Engineering Department organized a survey team to conduct on-site surveys and detailed investigations into the economic conditions along the line. At the same time, three lines from Linqing to Shunde, Zhangde, or Daokou were also planned for preliminary surveys and economic investigations, so that routes could be selected when extending the line in the future. It is now learned that the railway has formulated a plan for surveying the extended route, which has been divided into two types: exploration and preliminary survey. The exploration will be conducted on eight lines: Jinan to Dongchang, Jinan to Linqing, Linqing to Shunde, Linqing to Zhangde, Linqing to Daokou, Dongchang to Linqing, Dongchang to Zhangde, and Dongchang to Daokou. Preliminary surveys will also be conducted on the two lines from Jinan to Dongchang and Jinan to Linqing. The plan has been submitted to the Ministry of Railways and approved. (May 12th)</p>
<h3>A Batch of Books from the Haiyuan Pavilion Discovered</h3>
<p>A Total of Twenty Titles, Mostly Rare Song and Yuan Editions</p>
<p>Liu Songnian is Willing to Sell to the Library</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The loss of books from the Haiyuan Pavilion of the Yang family in Liaocheng has been reported in previous letters. Recently, a batch of books from the Haiyuan Pavilion was discovered in the Jinan market. It turns out that when Wang Guanjun's troops looted books from the Haiyuan Pavilion last year and headed north, they passed through Gaotang. One soldier, finding several sacks of books cumbersome, sold them to Liu Songnian, the director of the Gaotang Post Office, for sixty strings of cash (equivalent to three thousand copper coins). Liu did not pay much attention to the books at first. He entrusted a friend to sell them in Jinan, saying that if they were sold to the library for the public benefit, he would accept a lower price, as Liu is a public-spirited person. His friend came to Jinan and told Wang Xiantang, the director of the Provincial Library. Wang, knowing that they were books from the Haiyuan Pavilion, asked him to negotiate with Liu Songnian. The books have now been transported to Jinan, totaling twenty titles, mostly rare Song and Yuan editions, but some are incomplete. They include: (1) Yuan edition of Zhu Wen Gong's Commentary on Han Changli's Writings (complete), the main collection in forty volumes, the outer collection in blank volumes, and a volume of collected anecdotes and poems. (2) Fugubian (complete), Qing edition. (3) Manuscript of the Fengyunlou Book List (complete), Wang blank Sun's collection. (4) Manuscript of the Qinghuatang Poetry Draft (complete). (5) Manuscript of Mr. Xiong Wuxuan's Writings (complete). (6) Chunqiu Guliang Zhuan. (7) Dam Ming Yitong Zhi (incomplete), Ming edition. (8) Dongxiyang Kao (complete), Ming edition. (9) Du Gongbu (complete), Ming edition. (10) Manuscript of the Jiaoming Ji (complete). (11) Yuan edition of the Fan Deji Collection (complete). (12) Manuscript of the Wang Shuiyun Collection (complete). (13) Ming edition of the Ji Zhongsan Collection (complete). (14) Manuscript of the Shulin Waiji (complete). (15) Kaicheng Stone Classics (incomplete). (16) Manuscript of the Beitang Shuchao (incomplete). (17) Song edition of the Wei Suzhou Collection (one volume missing). (18) Liuyi Wenchao (complete). (19) Hailu Suishi (incomplete). (20) Hu-engraved Zizhi Tongjian (incomplete). After examining the books, Wang Xiantang directly wrote to Liu Songnian to negotiate. The main points of the original letter were: "I heard that you intend to sell all the books from the Haiyuan Pavilion to our library, and your public spirit is admirable. The estimated current market value of the books is eight hundred yuan, but if you sell them to booksellers, the price would be less. Our library is currently in contact with Yang Jingfu, the owner of the Haiyuan Pavilion, to have him donate half and sell half of his entire collection to the library, requesting the National Government to commend Mr. Yang. It would be best if you also sold the books at half price (four hundred yuan) to the library. Please also fulfill this kindness and ask the ministry to commend you with the Shandong Postal Administration." Liu Songnian is quite enlightened, and it is likely that this matter will be successful. The library has also recently purchased a copy of Xue's Inscriptions on Bells and Tripods, a manuscript from the Haiyuan Pavilion collection, for thirty yuan (incomplete). The book is finely copied on gold-flecked scripture paper from Mount Jinsu. The Haiyuan Pavilion Book List engraved by Jiang Jianxia originally had two volumes, but only one remains. The Qilu University Library in the city has also purchased two kinds of books from the Haiyuan Pavilion collection, but the titles are not detailed. (May 13th)</p>
<h3>Communist Bandits Massacre in Ruijin</h3>
<p>Many Bandits Killed in Suichuan and Anfu</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The bandits on the east bank of the Gan River, due to being severely suppressed by the National Army, are moving in large numbers to the east of Gan and Fujian. It is reported by refugees fleeing Ruijin that the county has been brutally massacred by bandits for many years, with about tens of thousands of people killed and over twenty million yuan in property lost. Fortunately, the local customs are strong, and a militia has been formed to resist the bandits, preventing them from being completely slaughtered by the Red bandits. Last winter, the local militia joined forces to recover the county seat, gaining some peace. Unexpectedly, this spring, Deng Yi's troops of the Red Army's pseudo-35th Army infiltrated Ruijin from Yunmenling and carried out a major massacre. Luo Binghui's troops of the pseudo-12th Army then joined Deng's troops from Ningdu to attack the county seat. The militia, outnumbered, lost the county seat again. After the bandits entered the city, the county government, the Party headquarters, various public buildings, and slightly better houses were all burned to the ground. Jiubao, Gaoweinao, and other places, which were the concentration areas of the county's militia, were also captured. Residents, young and old, fled. Because the Luo blank bandits blank the local residents blank blank, people were killed indiscriminately. Blank members of the Nine blank People blank blank and Tong Rongdi blank and hundreds of others were killed. Hundreds of buildings in Yangjiaze were blank blank. Hundreds of people, including Yang Jiaqiu, were captured, extorted, and imprisoned in the bandits' lair. Tens of thousands of farmers from the surrounding villages blank fled to Ganzhou, and thousands more fled to Huichang Yunmenling, all displaced, in a state of wanting to live but being unable to die. It is indeed tragic. Suichuan was previously occupied by Li Mingrui's troops. After being recovered by Luo Lin's division, it was guarded by the county police force. On the 28th of last month, a large number of Red bandits suddenly rushed into the county seat. County Magistrate Wang and the police force, caught off guard, withdrew from the city and gathered their troops to fight back with all their might, causing the bandits to retreat from the county seat. Some Red bandits, unable to retreat in time, were disarmed by the police force. As for Li Mingrui himself, at the end of last month, he led the pseudo-7th Army from Yongxin Suichuan to Anfu, launching a fierce attack on Anfu County. At that time, only one regiment of Han's division was in the city, and they defended the city to the death. The bandits used ladders to climb the city walls but were still repelled, with many bandits killed. Unable to succeed, the bandits retreated to Liaotangqiao, 25 li from the city, that night, intending to counterattack. The next day, government troops arrived to reinforce them, and the bandits were repelled again, with over two thousand bandits killed. The bandits then retreated to the Jinqingtian and Daonanzhen areas. Division Commander Han and Brigade Commander Zhang have now stationed their troops in the county to command their units and the police forces of Yongxin and Lianhua counties, joining forces with the Fourth Route Army to eliminate Li's bandits.

<h3>Pseudo-Communist Suppression Team Leader Arrested in Bengbu</h3>
<p>Yan Weiyu Set Up a Scam to Defraud Money</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: Yan Weiyu, who previously impersonated the commander of the Longjin Railway Communist Suppression Volunteer Team, falsely claimed to be under the direct jurisdiction of the central government in January of this year and led his accomplices in the areas of Xu, Bengbu and Linhuai. The Ji Battalion of the 268th Regiment of the 45th Division captured more than twenty of them in Linhuai. Division Commander Wei Lihuang telegraphed a report to the capital. The central government immediately issued an order to the garrison troops of Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, Henan and other provinces to cooperate in the arrest. Before long, Yan secretly came to Bengbu and hid behind the old Governor's Office on Erma Road. In recent months, Yan has falsely used the names of Zhang Fuyun, the Director of the National Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance, Zhang Gongchen of Anhui, and Yue Shengxuan, the Commander of the 46th Division, to forge appointment letters from the Anhui Provincial Tobacco Prohibition Bureau and the Anhui Provincial Tobacco Prohibition Committee, and privately engraved seals and sold official positions such as District Director, Deputy Director, Branch Director, and Inspector, charging dozens to hundreds of yuan per position. Miao Jiesan of Suxian County, desiring to obtain a position as Director of a Tobacco Prohibition Branch Bureau, gave Yan 800 yuan, plus miscellaneous expenses, totaling more than 1,000 yuan. Yan then gave Miao a fake appointment letter. However, Miao has not been able to take office from March to now. Miao realized that he had been deceived by Yan, and was very angry. A few days ago, he submitted a document to the Northern Anhui Garrison Headquarters accusing Yan of fraud and requesting his arrest and investigation. At the same time, Liu Yisan, the former confidential secretary of the pseudo-Communist Suppression Volunteer Team, also filed a complaint, saying that Yan had swindled him out of five box cannons last year. These guns were borrowed from someone, and Yan had repeatedly refused to return them. He also accused Yan of extorting more than 1,000 yuan from someone named Jia in Renqiao, and requested his prompt arrest and investigation to recover the guns. Upon receiving the report, the Garrison Headquarters dispatched a team at noon on the 12th to arrest Yan Weiyu at his address and seized many pieces of evidence. He was sent to the Public Security Bureau that night for detention. Yesterday (the 13th) afternoon, the Garrison Headquarters sent a team to bring Yan back for interrogation by the Military Law Office. Yan suddenly claimed to be ill and was temporarily released on bail to a hospital for treatment. He will be summoned for interrogation as soon as he recovers. (14th)</p>
<h3>Northern Wei Antiquities from Tianlong Mountain</h3>
<p>Occupying an Extremely Important Position in Art</p>
<p>There are Rumors of Theft and Sale</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: Tianlong Mountain in Taiyuan County, Shanxi Province, is a famous scenic spot. There is a temple at the foot of the mountain, about eighty li from the provincial capital. Cars can reach the vicinity. The temple buildings are magnificent, and the trees reach the sky, making it look like a large village. The four mountains surround it, with cliffs standing upright. There are ancient cypresses on the top of the mountain that are more than a dozen feet in circumference. However, due to the rugged mountain roads, many tourists have not been able to get a close look. The scenery is excellent, and the terrain is relatively high, and the climate is very cool. In recent years, many Chinese and foreigners have gone there to escape the summer heat. The mountain walls have Buddhist statues made during the Northern Wei Dynasty, carved into recessed shapes in the stone walls. They are a masterpiece of the Northern Wei Tuoba clan during its heyday, occupying an extremely important position in Eastern art and sculpture history. According to art critics, their value is higher than that of the Yungang Grottoes in Datong. Therefore, they are highly admired by Chinese and foreigners, especially the Japanese. Since Dr. Tokiwa Daijo, a Japanese literary scholar, published a masterpiece describing their value, they have attracted the attention of scholars in the East and West. In the 15th year of the Republic of China, the Crown Prince of Sweden came to Shanxi to investigate and regarded them as national treasures of China. The number of Japanese who come to Shanxi every year specifically to visit this mountain is even more numerous. Even a brick or a piece of wood is considered a treasure, so many people pick up broken tiles from the temple. A student from a certain Japanese university, using the art of the temple as material for his doctoral dissertation, has come to Shanxi. Due to its reputation, unscrupulous people always want to steal and sell them to obtain huge sums of money. There have been repeated thefts in the past two or three years, which have caused a national sensation. In order to preserve the national essence, the Ministry of Education telegraphed the Shanxi Provincial Government last spring, requesting that it be carefully protected. The Provincial Government immediately ordered Taiyuan County to investigate. The Magistrate of Taiyuan County then expelled the abbot of the temple and sent a special commissioner to guard it. It is now learned that a man named Wang Shanting, a native of Hebei, who was previously a section chief of the Tianjin Executive Headquarters of the Pingjin Garrison Command, came to Shanxi in desperation and bribed the guards of Tianlong Mountain, blank precious statues, blank blank, the situation blank blank people, still higher than Bing blank, I do not know why the authorities of Shanxi province do not strictly investigate this matter, (10th)</p>

Five male and female bandits were captured on the spot, and four firearms and a quantity of ammunition and stolen goods were seized. The people and goods were all taken to the 9th Branch for detention. The bandit ships were also locked up. Due to the limited police force at the branch, they specially requested that the Public Security Bureau dispatch a Browning team to the countryside on the 15th to bring them to the city for interrogation.</p>
<p>Detective Zhu Captures Bandit in Shanghai: The home of Xu Zhangshi near Cuiqiao Town, 5th District of Wuyi County, was previously robbed and someone was injured. A suspect named Qian Gengsheng was arrested and sent to the county for interrogation. Detective Zhu Sen of the town's Public Security Substation learned that the ringleader of the gang, Zhong Longbao, was hiding in Shanghai. He immediately led detectives, carrying official documents and firearms, to Shanghai on the 13th. They captured the ringleader Zhong Longbao at No. 21 Yuqing Lane in the French Concession. That night, he was temporarily detained at the Third Section of the Fourth District of the Zhabei Public Security Bureau. On the 14th, the suspect was taken on the noon train to Changzhou. In the evening, he underwent a preliminary hearing at the Public Security Bureau. On the 15th, he was transferred to the county government for investigation.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Robbing Boat Bandits Arrested: Two merchant boats of Xinzhuang and Luyuan were previously robbed in Huqiao one after another. Afterwards, the 13th Water Police Team stationed in Changshu arrested Luo Zengquan, Jin Changxi, and Chen Changcai, three people from Taicang County, outside the West Gate. According to their statements, they had legitimate occupations, and they were released on bail on the 13th. However, on the afternoon of the 12th, the team received a tip that the robbers were hiding in Dahu Dian outside the South Gate. Upon receiving the report, Team Leader Yang Qingjiu dispatched Officer Hu to Dahu Dian with the informant on the morning of the 13th, where they arrested Chen Er and Wu Da. Later, they captured a bandit ship in front of the Daxing Warehouse in Yongjiqiao, and arrested Wang Xiaolao Han and Jiang Xiaoliuzi, two people, on the ship. They were all taken to the Second Platoon and transferred to the 13th Team Headquarters. After Team Leader Yang personally interrogated them, Chen Er confessed that his other name was Jinbao, a native of Yancheng. On the eighth day of the third month of the lunar calendar, he and Wu Da, Wang Xiaolao Han, and others sailed to the Huqiao area outside the West Gate, planning to land there to steal chickens. Unexpectedly, in the middle of the night, a merchant boat passed by, and they had the idea of robbing it. They robbed the boat and took 84 pieces of cloth, 20 yuan in foreign currency, and more than 20,000 copper coins. There was nothing else. The cloth had already been pawned, and the money had been spent. When questioned, Jiang Xiaoliuzi only claimed that he was sailing the boat for them and denied any robbery. The statements of Wu Da and Wang Xiaolao Han were similar to Chen Er's. Based on the confessions, Team Leader Yang temporarily detained the bandits at the team headquarters and decided to hand them over to the Suzhou District Headquarters for interrogation on the 14th.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Zhanwenqiao Defense Corps Captures Bandits: At about 2 PM on the 14th, several bandits suddenly came to rob the home of villager Chen A-mo in Chenjiagang, 7 li from Zhanwenqiao Street, Second District of Dongwai. Because only women were at home, the bandits set a fire. The Zhanwenqiao Defense Corps heard the alarm and went to the scene, capturing one bandit, wounding one corps member, and burning two bandits to death. The captured bandit was handed over to the county for processing.</p>
<p>The Truth About Sub-Bureau Chief's Private Torture of Chen Xianghan: Huang Zhifang, the sub-bureau chief of the Houmu Public Security Third Sub-bureau, in order to prevent merchants from celebrating the opening of the National Assembly, prohibited theatrical performances, causing a market strike. He arbitrarily arrested Chen Xianghan and privately tortured him. Zhou Fanshun, a patrol officer, advised him to stop, but Huang Zhifang did not listen. Later, because Ren Shaoshan stood up for Chen Xianghan to the merchants, proving that Chen Xianghan had indeed been privately tortured, Huang Zhifang used the excuse of inciting a market strike to arrest Ren Shaoshan and send him to the county for interrogation. The merchants of Houmu strongly refuted this, saying that Huang Zhifang's private torture of Chen Xianghan caused serious injuries, and there were injury reports and witnesses. But Ren Shaoshan was groundlessly arrested and sent to the county for interrogation. Chen Xianghan left the sub-bureau, and Sub-bureau Chief Huang set off firecrackers late at night and respectfully escorted him home before the market was allowed to open.</p>
<p>Jiang Sheng Daily is Sued: Wu Jiangshi, the widow of the late shop owner Wu Yufeng of the Wu Yisheng Rice Shop in Jintongqiao, First District, hired lawyer Xia Ding because the Jiang Sheng Daily published a news item on April 17 about plotting to seize his wife's property, which damaged his reputation. He filed a criminal lawsuit with the county government. Yesterday (the 13th) afternoon, Judge Wu heard the case in court. The plaintiff Wu Jiangshi and the editor of the Jiang Sheng Daily, Wang Sengru, were present. The judge asked the plaintiff which newspaper was being sued. The plaintiff did not know how to answer, only saying it was a newspaper. She then said that because the news had damaged his reputation, he had asked his maternal uncle, Zhang Liangshi, to write a letter to the newspaper on the 18th to make a correction, but it was not published, so he filed the lawsuit. When questioned, Wang Sengru said that the news item was a submitted manuscript, and it was difficult to judge whether it was true or not. However, if there was a mistake, he could send a letter to make a correction according to the publishing law, but the newspaper had not received a letter from Wu Jiangshi. Wu Jiangshi's lawsuit did not mention that the lawsuit was filed because no correction was made. After the hearing, the judge ordered Zhang Liangshi to be summoned to court for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Bandits Arrested in Yizheng and Sent to the Governor's Office for Interrogation: The Pacification Governor's Office previously received a report from a farmer named Peng in Guishan Village, Yizheng, stating that a seven-and-a-half-month-old child had been abducted by bandits and torn up. The Yizheng County was ordered to investigate and bring the perpetrators to justice. Shi Maozhong, Peng Dezhao, Peng Guangshan, Chen Dingfu, Zhou Kuaizi, Xiao Shenqi, and Chen Pengshi, seven people in total, have now been arrested by the county. They were escorted to the office this morning to await trial.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Four Representatives Go to Beijing to Petition: The 11th Division of Hankou sent personnel to Nantong to prepare for the establishment of a disabled soldiers' vocational training factory, which was unanimously opposed by all sectors of society. On the 13th, Zhao Jian and three others were selected to go to Beijing to petition the headquarters. Various organizations and the Chinese Association telegraphed Commander-in-Chief Chiang, saying, "We, the association, etc., believe that the 11th Division stationed in Hankou designated to establish a disabled soldiers' factory in Nantong has many obstacles. We submitted it to the party and government organs and held a joint meeting. Zhao Jianhua, Cheng Yunke, Hou Ruzhou, and Wang Jimin were publicly elected as petition representatives. We respectfully submit the reasons why a disabled soldiers' factory cannot be established in Nantong. We respectfully request that Your Excellency grant an audience and promptly order the division to select another location, etc." Zhuang Mingyuan, a member of the 11th Division Committee, returned to Hankou on the 13th to ask for instructions due to local opposition.</p>
<p>Robberies and Assaults Occur Frequently in Urban and Rural Areas: The atmosphere in the urban and rural areas of Nantong is uneasy. At 2 a.m. on the 14th, the Lu family east of Hongmiao was robbed, and the victim was killed. The Gaolian Nunnery was robbed, and the nuns were raped. Furthermore, an American named Xie Lesi was robbed by bandits near Houting in the west of the city. He has filed a complaint with the American consul for intervention. The county government, due to the frequent occurrence of banditry, has ordered the Public Security Bureau and the county police to patrol the roads from time to time. Because the census has been completed, a notice was issued to the people on the 14th, forbidding them to accommodate idlers. The Public Security Bureau was also ordered to investigate.</p>
<p>Change of Head of Shigang Anti-Smuggling Team: The head of the Shigang Huainan Salt Affairs Anti-Smuggling Water Team has been changed by the Anti-Smuggling Bureau to Ni Chong.</p>
<h3>Huzhou</h3>
<p>Kidnapping Occurs in Yaotou Village: In Yaotou Village, located at the border of Xiaang Town and Jingshan in Wuxing County, where there are more than 40 households, mostly surnamed Shen, two bandit ships suddenly arrived around 6 p.m. on the 10th of this month. About 20 bandits, each carrying firearms, rushed ashore and carried out a large-scale robbery in the village. Shen A-jin, Shen A-si, Shen A-xue, Shen Jitang and other four families were robbed, suffering huge losses. Six villagers, men and women, including Shen A-lian, Shen Xin-yuan, Shen A-jin, Shen A-mao, and Mao Mao, were kidnapped. After the incident, various authorities, upon hearing the news, dispatched police officers to investigate in all directions, but there was no trace of the bandits.</p>
<h3>Pinghu</h3>
<p>The Truth About Wang Jingqing's Appeal: Wang Jingqing of Ganhe Street in this city was sentenced to life imprisonment for attempted rape of Gai Zhao, which led to the woman's suicide out of shame and anger. Wang refused to accept the sentence and appealed to the High Court. According to reliable sources in Hangzhou, the High Court considered the appellant's appeal unreasonable and rejected it in court, dismissing the prosecution. The original sentence was still enforced. The rumors that he was resentenced to death by hanging in recent days were all false.</p>
<p>The Crisis of Education in Zha District: The educational funding in Zha District has always been extremely tight. In addition, the management committee has been mismanaging affairs, and the funding owed to various schools has been overdue for more than four months. The teachers and staff of various schools have been asking the principals for their salaries, and the principals have found it difficult to cope and unable to maintain operations. They will soon convene a meeting to unanimously petition the Education Bureau.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Ancient Tomb of Concubine Song Wang Robbed: There is an ancient tomb of a Song Dynasty royal concubine in He Yan, Sanjiadun East Jiangqiao, Hangzhou County. Due to years of neglect, all the tomb stones have been stolen and sold by local ruffians. However, the concubine's coffin has not yet been excavated. Recently, a local tyrant named Zhu Xiaolei secretly colluded with unscrupulous people such as Jiang Tianfu, falsely claiming to be the landlord, and sold the tomb to Zhu. Zhu then hired workers to excavate it. Two ancient bottles and 7,000 ancient coins were found. A gap was also exposed in the soil, and a stone was thrown down, making a clanging sound, indicating that it was the place where the concubine's coffin was suspended. Originally, they intended to continue digging deeper to steal the treasures in the coffin, but because they were afraid of being seen, they covered it with soil again. A few days later, they summoned dozens of workers and built a mud wall around the tomb, which is now half completed. After it is completed, they plan to close the door and directly explore the location of the concubine's coffin and inspect the treasures inside. Local citizens Jiang Yifei, Xie Naichang, etc., believe that all antiquities should be preserved according to the law, and local people should not privately occupy or destroy them. Now that Zhu Xiaolei has illegally excavated the tomb of a famous concubine, he should be stopped. They specially wrote a letter to the provincial government requesting that officials be sent to investigate thoroughly and that Zhu Xiaolei and Jiang Tianfu be detained and brought to justice according to the law. After receiving the report, the provincial government ordered the Hangzhou County magistrate to investigate and report back for verification.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing</h3>
<p>Unbearable Wife-Murder Case: An unbearable wife-murder case occurred in Huangniutang, south of Shaoxing, yesterday. Yin Dachun, who works as a grocery store clerk in Heilongjiang, returns home once a year. His wife, Yin Zhao, is 31 years old and has two sons. Yin returned home in early May and heard that his wife had an affair, and they had an argument. Later, the wife's mother mediated, and they reconciled. Unexpectedly, on the night of the 10th, the woman suddenly shouted loudly. Neighbors heard the sound and went to check, but the husband had already fled. The woman was lying face down and unable to move. When people asked her the reason, she said that her husband had forced her to lie face down after intercourse, and then suddenly used a round wooden stick to stuff her vagina, causing serious injuries. She died tragically at midnight the next day. Her aunt prepared the body for burial. The incident was reported to the Lizhu Public Security Bureau, which reported it to the local branch court. Prosecutor Yang, accompanied by coroner Hu, went to the countryside to open the coffin for an autopsy. It was found that the vagina and uterus were broken, and the death was indeed caused by serious injuries sustained during her lifetime. The murderer is now being strictly apprehended and brought to justice for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Compilation of Kidnapping Cases: Ma Mingluo, a resident of Majia Village, Yuntan Township, Yuyao, is from a family of modest means. The other night, more than ten bandits suddenly came and carried out a large-scale robbery, and kidnapped Ma Mingluo. At the same time, six or seven bandits went to the home of Ma Mingbao in the same place and carried out a robbery, also kidnapping Mingbao. Furthermore, in Zhangai Village, Meixu, Yin County, five or six bandits suddenly came to the home of resident Shen Xianghua the other day, and robbed gold jewelry, clothing, etc., worth about 400 yuan, and also stabbed the victim Shen Xianghua. Furthermore, two families, Wu Yongming and Zhang Liushi, in Baozhuang, Yin County, were robbed by bandits the other day of more than 200 yuan worth of clothing, gold jewelry, etc., and Wu Lushi and Wu Caiying were injured. Furthermore, more than ten bandits also came to the home of Zhou Lianzhong, a farmer in Suqiao near Xiwu, Fenghua, the other night. They entered through the front door. Zhou heard the alarm and secretly opened the back door to escape and sound the alarm. Neighbors gathered, and the bandits knew that things were not going well and fled in all directions. However, Zhou's house was surrounded by small rivers, making it difficult for the bandits to escape. Wang Shaoxi and Wang A-fu were arrested in the rice paddy and sent to the Clearing and Suppression Bureau for investigation. Furthermore, the family of Fan in Xiyu Village, Yuanyuan District, Fenghua, also had a few bandits who kidnapped his eight-year-old son yesterday, and his whereabouts are still unknown.</p>
<p>Dispute Over Gambling Leads to Murder: The Xinjian Tianlun arrived in Ningbo from Shanghai on the 12th. That evening, around 8 p.m., Jiang A-mao, a carpenter on the ship, and Zhang Yifa, a teahouse worker, had a dispute over gambling and fought each other. Unexpectedly, after the fight, Jiang A-mao returned to his room to sleep and suddenly felt severe pain in his chest. He immediately became unconscious and died shortly after. The incident was heard by the ship's purser, who, believing that Zhang Yifa had beaten Jiang, ordered the ship's police to watch Zhang. The next morning, the ship arrived at Ningbo port and reported the incident to the court for an autopsy. The suspect Zhang Yifa was taken to the court and sent to prison to await interrogation. Jiang's body is still displayed in the Zhaoshangju Alley, covered with a shed for safekeeping, pending resolution.</p>

<h3>Final Details</h3>
<p>1500 meters The men's track race yesterday only had this one final. Zhang Yuansheng of Central and Ma Fengrui of Zhonggong were the most promising, but Zhang had suffered from neurasthenia a few days ago. Yesterday, he failed to show his skills. Ma Fengrui led the way and no one could compete with him, winning first place with a new meeting record of 4 minutes 43 seconds 54. Zhou Mingzhang of Central was about 30 meters behind. It is said that Zhang Yuansheng had pushed Zhou back 40 to 50 meters at the Central University Games. Therefore, if Zhang was in good health yesterday, he would have been able to compete with Ma for first place, and the results would have been even more impressive.</p>
<p>Women's 200 meters Yesterday was originally a preliminary round, but it was changed to a final due to the small number of people. Huang Luanjiao of Jinan once led, with large steps and beautiful posture, but when there were 50 meters left, Wu Zhuhuan of Central suddenly sprinted and surpassed Ms. Luanjiao, winning the championship with a mediocre time of 33.8 seconds.</p>
<p>Men's High Jump The results of this event were not outstanding. Li Lin of Fudan failed at 1.60 meters, which was a pity. There were still five people at 1.63 meters. Wu Jinqi took the lead with 1.69 meters, and Chen Sui was second with 1.64 meters because he had just finished the high hurdles. The remaining three people all retreated to below 1.63 meters when determining the rankings, perhaps because they were all too nervous.</p>
<p>Women's High Jump There were only five participants at the beginning, and more came later. Ye Zhanmei of Central and Lu Weikun of Daxia competed fiercely, with the height difference being only one notch. Ye's result was a mediocre 1.18 meters. Women's Shot Put Wang Lan'yin of Jinan won first place with 7.98 meters. The athletes did not seem to be able to use their elasticity, so the throws were not far.</p>
<p>Men's Long Jump The most talented athletes were in the long jump. Zhao Rugong of Central, who was the most promising, committed two fouls and gave up on the third attempt, which was a pity. Wang Jihuai competed with illness and came from behind to win first place with 6.62 meters.</p>
<p>Men's Discus Throw The wind was very strong yesterday, and the results could not be improved. Wang Jihuai did not score points due to illness. Gao Shangzhi of Central won the championship with 31.0 meters, which was mediocre.</p>
<p>Wang Jihuai, the King of Field Events from Guanghua, ate several packs of ice cream the day before, followed by noodles, and then ate ice cream again, resulting in severe diarrhea. He competed with illness yesterday, so he did not score in the discus throw, but he still won first place in the long jump.</p>
<h3>Championship Situation</h3>
<p>—Central and Jinan—</p>
<p>—Already Engaged in Close Combat—</p>
<p>In this year's conference, Central University, with the status of last year's champion, arrived with a large contingent and substantial strength, harboring great ambition to retain the championship. However, Jinan University, having prepared its troops and sharpened its weapons, is determined to compete for victory. Judging from yesterday's results, Central University may not necessarily defeat Jinan, which has a good chance of winning. The following is a description of the championship situation:</p>
<p>—Track and Field Championship—</p>
<p>Central University Tense. Although Central University ranked first in yesterday's scoring, it only led Jinan by three points. Central's biggest failure was in the long jump. Zhao Rugong committed two fouls and then abandoned his third attempt, resulting in the complete loss of one of their most promising athletes.</p>

<h3>Semi-Final Results</h3>
<p>Men's 100 Meters</p>
<p>First Group (1) Zhong Lianji (Jinan) (2) Jiang Peng (Guang) (3) Huang Feilong (Jinan) 12 seconds Second Group (1) Gu Zaiping (Fu) (2) Hao Chunde (Jinan) (3) Ma Youcheng (Guang) 11.7 seconds (Note) Only this one event was held. The 200 meters was not held due to lack of participants, resulting in Jinan getting second place and adding three points. Today Jinan has Cao Yu in pole vault, Wen Dingxin in javelin, and Xie Quanhe in shot put, who are also strong. Central cannot be optimistic yet. However, Zhao Rugong in the triple jump may be able to regain a spot, so there is still hope. However, Guanghua's field events are also not weak, so Central needs to work twice as hard.</p>
<p>—Track Championship—</p>
<p>Jinan Spurs On. Jinan has more hope in track events. Even if they cannot be first in short distances, they should be able to control everything. Zhong Lianji, Hao Chunde, and Huang Feilong are in the 100 meters and 200 meters, and Fu Hefan and Zeng Rongzhong are in the 400 meters. There are many points in this event. They need to work harder in other events, and there is also hope. Chen Ling of Central University can steadily get ten points in the hurdles. They have completely failed in short distances, so it remains to be seen how they will do in long distances.</p>
<p>—Women's Championship—</p>
<p>Central Has Hope. Central has the most talent. Except for Jinan, other schools have very few participants. They have already obtained eighteen points yesterday. Today, they will steadily take Jingzhou in the 50 meters and 100 meters. Most of the championship will belong to them.</p>

<h3>Tianma vs. Gujia Ping Pong Champagne Final Tomorrow Night</h3>
<p>—At the Ningbo Native Place Association—</p>
<p>Jiaotong University Plans to Hold an Exhibition Match</p>
<p>The Ping Pong Champagne Cup final, which has been much publicized, is just around the corner. The two teams competing, Tianma and Gujia, will do their best to win this dazzling silver cup. Also, the Jiaotong University combined team and the Qibu combined team will hold an exhibition match on the same night at 7 p.m. Therefore, at the Ningbo Native Place Association tomorrow night starting at 7 p.m., we will see the athletes of each team gathered together, fighting fiercely.</p>
<p>Since the advance sale of tickets, people from all walks of life have been enthusiastically purchasing them. However, the Cup Organizing Committee believes that the venue is limited, so the number of tickets is also quite limited. Once sold out, no replacements will be made. It is hoped that fans will purchase them in advance to avoid regret. Furthermore, anyone without a ticket at the time will be denied entry, regardless of who they are.</p>

<p>Rules and Penalties Decided</p>
<p>Expanded Prize List</p>
<p>List of Racers Announced</p>
<p>The highly anticipated twelve-mile Chinese race is scheduled to be held at 8 a.m. tomorrow. The following are the important updates obtained yesterday:</p>
<h3>Revised Route</h3>
<p>The route initially set by the association had the final section going straight to the athletic field from Lafayette Road. However, after investigation, Lafayette Road is currently under repair. The French Chief Inspector is concerned that the large number of spectators may hinder the racers. He requested the association's consent to change to a route of the same distance. The association specially sent Shi Youhui and Yao Wenhui yesterday afternoon to negotiate with the French Chief Inspector. The Chief Inspector first expressed his support and explained the road repair situation, requesting a change to Fulu Li Road leading directly to the athletic field. Shi and Yao agreed (see route map for details). The Chief Inspector also said that he would send a large number of police officers to protect the route.</p>
<h3>Rules and Penalties Decided</h3>
<p>The association convened a meeting of referees at 5:30 p.m. yesterday to decide on the penalties, as follows: (1) The referees will be assigned by the chief referee to different sections of the route, depending on the number of racers, to issue warnings and penalties, record the number of violations, and submit them to the chief referee for review. (2) If there are too many guides, hindering the progress of the racers, it is proposed to have them introduced in sections: racers numbered 1 to 150 should wait at the intersection of Wujiao Chang, and racers numbered 151 to 249 should wait at the entrance of Zhaofeng Garden. (3) Guides are not allowed to leave the racer they are guiding on the route and must follow the instructions of the referees at all times. (4) If other racers pass the racer being guided, the guide must give way and not deliberately obstruct them. Otherwise, the racer being guided will receive a warning. (5) Guides must stop at the intersection of Luban Road and take another route directly into the athletic field to prepare clothes for the racer to wear and are not allowed to enter or linger again. (6) All racers must gather at 7:30 a.m. on the 17th for roll call and departure. (7) Performers must wear blue short-sleeved shirts worn by the youth, without the need to wear numbers, but with a national flag on their chest. Guides are exempt to avoid congestion.</p>
<h3>Expanded Prize List</h3>
<p>The association originally planned to award prizes to ten people. Recently, due to the large number of prizes donated by various sectors, it was decided to distribute all prizes as much as possible to encourage the racers.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Held Hygiene Movement Week</h3>
<p>First Day's Situation</p>
<p>Yesterday was the first day of the Shanghai Municipal Seventh Hygiene Movement Week. The Public Security Bureau specially ordered the head patrolmen of each district to supervise the sanitation workers at dawn to conduct a thorough cleaning in the city. The Municipal Health Bureau, regarding the publicity and implementation work of each section, advanced concurrently and was extraordinarily busy. The yesterday's situation is compiled as follows:</p>
<p>Citywide Cleanup　The central government stipulated yesterday (the</p>
<p>15th) as the national city and county cleanup day. After receiving the order, the Shanghai Public Security Bureau specially notified the 29 district police stations in the city and countryside a few days ago to urge the sanitation patrolmen to carry out cleaning and sweeping yesterday. More than 500 sanitation workers intensified sweeping as soon as it dawned. By 9 a.m., the main roads of the city were already presenting a clean road surface. At 12 noon and 3 p.m., the urban districts were still supervised by the sanitation patrolmen to continue sweeping. It is also heard that in addition to the special cleanup on the day stipulated by the central government (i.e., yesterday), the Municipal Public Security Bureau will strictly supervise the cleaning work from the 16th to the 21st. On one hand, each patrolman is responsible for rectification, and on the other hand, the bureau's special commissioner goes to the main roads and avenues of each district to investigate and observe, it is said.</p>
<p>Generality of Slogans　The day before yesterday, the Municipal Health</p>
<p>Bureau sent personnel to lead workers to post wall slogans in various districts of the north and south cities. Hygiene movement slogan strips in red and green characters and cholera posters on the walls of main roads, avenues, and near tram stops can be seen everywhere by passersby. The key points are recorded as follows: "Boil water before drinking, never drink raw water to avoid cholera," "Do not buy and eat exposed food and cut and sold melons and fruits," "To avoid cholera, get a vaccination quickly," "Pay attention to public health and cultivate a healthy nation," "Do not spit or urinate anywhere," etc. For the sake of widespread publicity, the bureau will continue to post these wall slogans and cholera pictures today (the 16th). The rickshaw association is responsible for the slogans posted on the rickshaw frames and forwards them to each rickshaw company to post on the frames. They have been found in the city yesterday, but only in a few places. The bureau believes that the hygiene slogans posted on rickshaws last year were not earnestly implemented, so this year it supervised the association to intensify implementation and rush to paste them widely on the 17th and 18th. At the same time, the bureau sent personnel to use trams, buses, and long-distance buses to post them. On the 19th and 20th, they were specially posted on telegraph poles.</p>
<p>Busy Vaccinations at the North Station　The health</p>
<p>department of the two railway administrations has expanded prevention work since the 15th. It specially cooperated with the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau to jointly run a free cholera vaccination station at the Shanghai North Railway Station, specializing in advising passengers from other places coming to Shanghai to get free cholera vaccine injections. It has been open since 8 a.m. yesterday. Medical officers and nurses dispatched by the railway bureau and medical staff dispatched by the Health Bureau set up tables and chairs outside the first and second-class waiting rooms inside the North Railway Station to cooperate in handling. From 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., cholera vaccine injections have been given to hundreds of passengers.</p>
<p>Departure Team This Morning　This morning (the 16th), a</p>
<p>team of doctors and nurses were dispatched to various municipal primary schools in the north and south cities to administer cholera vaccinations. The schools they went to include Municipal Xunyu, Mingzong, Cangji, Hubei, Gongshang, Dexin, Xinmin, and other primary schools.</p>
<p>Slow Vaccinations in Shantytowns　The shantytown areas in the city</p>
<p>are very numerous. The Health Bureau pays great attention to the hygiene of shantytown residents and the poor. From May 1st to yesterday, doctors have been vaccinating shantytown residents and children with cowpox vaccine every day. As of yesterday, a total of 20,297 people have been vaccinated. From November 1st last year to yesterday, a total of 181,329 people have been vaccinated. Although doctors went to shantytown residences yesterday to advise on cholera vaccinations, the poor often said "the weather is not hot yet" as a pretext. The doctors earnestly advised, but only a few responded to the vaccinations. Now the bureau has decided to implement compulsory vaccinations from the 20th. The period for vaccinations in shantytowns was previously stipulated by the bureau to be from May 1st to the turn of August and September, it is said.</p>
<p>Two Large Yellow Umbrellas　The Health Bureau specially made two large yellow</p>
<p>umbrellas, with a canopy length diameter of about eight feet and a bamboo handle more than ten feet long, painted with red slogans, for doctors and nurses to use to shield from the sun when going to shantytowns to administer vaccinations.</p>
<p>Public Notice from the Health Bureau　Hu</p>
<p>Hongji, Director of the Municipal Health Bureau, issued a public notice yesterday, which was posted on the sides of various main roads, attached with various hygiene slogans. The public notice includes eight key points: (1) Everyone should get cholera vaccinations to prevent cholera; (2) Boil water before drinking, never drink raw water to avoid cholera; (3) Do not buy and eat exposed food and cut and sold melons and fruits; (4) Do not spit or urinate anywhere; (5) Everyone should pay attention to personal hygiene; (6) Everyone should maintain public hygiene; (7) If you are sick, you should see a doctor, do not be superstitious about seeking gods and taking elixir; (8) Maintain street cleanliness, do not step on it at will. The Situation in Shanghai County　Various agencies under Shanghai County</p>
<p>held a meeting at Maqiao in Puxi at 10 a.m. yesterday. Fu Dianying of the County Government, Jiang Yanchou, Tao Yishan, Gong of the Construction Bureau, She of the Education Bureau, Wang Chengyao of the Sixth District of the County, and hundreds of people from all walks of life attended. First, a meeting was held at Maqiao Qiangshu School, chaired by Wang Chengyao. After performing the rituals, the chairman first reported on the significance of the hygiene movement, followed by speeches by various officials. After the meeting, a photo was taken, and then the team marched in a parade. Each official held a broom and swept along the way. Hygiene slogans were posted everywhere, which was quite a grand occasion for a while.</p>
<p>The Situation in Baoshan County　Qiu Ming,</p>
<p>the magistrate of Baoshan County, convened more than 1,000 people from various agencies, groups, schools, and the public at the People's Assembly Hall at 1 p.m. yesterday to hold a grand cleanup and hygiene movement meeting. Magistrate Qiu chaired the meeting and reported on the significance of the cleanup and the elements of the hygiene movement and the relationship with the people's well-being in detail. Then representatives from various agencies and groups gave speeches one after another (the length of the speeches is omitted). Immediately afterwards, a parade set off, starting from the Assembly Hall, passing through Xin Street, out of the West Gate, passing along the city river, facing east, passing Xinglong Bridge, entering the West Gate, facing west to the Drum Tower, entering the North Gate, passing along Fengjia River, entering the East Gate, facing west to the Drum Tower, entering South Gate Street, passing through Miaonong, and returning to the People's Assembly Hall for dispersal. During the parade, leaflets were distributed along the way, slogans were shouted, and slogans were posted. The viewers blocked the road.</p>
<h3>Yesterday, the Fresh Meat Industry Implemented Slaughter Cessation</h3>
<p>Overnight Meat to Meet the Market</p>
<p>Talks with the Municipal Finance Bureau</p>
<p>The fresh meat industry in the north and south cities of the Chinese area, in opposition to the municipal government's direct collection of slaughter tax, held a meeting at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and resolved five conditions. On one hand, representatives such as Jin Guifu and Huang Jitang were sent to the capital to petition. It is learned that the authorities in the capital are holding a national conference these days and have no time to meet with the representatives, so Jin and others only submitted their petition and have already returned to Shanghai. However, the fresh meat shops are still insisting on the requirement that the slaughter tax be changed to a business tax and that the pre-slaughter and post-slaughter inspection fees be abolished. Starting yesterday, they have implemented a slaughter cessation and have asked a certain merchant to mediate. It is said that the meat sold yesterday and today is overnight meat slaughtered the day before yesterday.</p>
<p>The Municipal Finance Bureau issued a notice that after the collection of the slaughter tax, it has been ten days, and the meat industry is still in dispute. Now we have obtained a detailed account of the situation from the bureau as follows: This bureau was ordered to take over the slaughter tax in the urban area, which was originally scheduled to be collected on May 1st. After the announcement, most meat businesses were waiting and watching. The initial intention of this bureau was that this tax revenue was transferred back to the city by the Jiangsu Education Fund Management Office and was changed from contractor payment to direct collection. The meat businesses may not fully understand it, so they did not hesitate to send personnel to lead and guide them separately, hoping to avoid misunderstandings. Unexpectedly, after many days of delay, no one was seen buying tax tickets. When asked, the people in the meat business said that they originally wanted to comply with the regulations and pay taxes, but because the industry association asked them to wait for a solution, they dared not buy tickets alone, etc. Later, it was reported that a certain meat shop in the north of the city was carrying money to buy tax tickets, but was stopped halfway by colleagues, etc. This bureau repeatedly investigated the facts and believed that there must be someone manipulating it from behind. If strict enforcement is not carried out, it will inevitably become more and more serious. Unable to do otherwise, on the 9th of the month, each collection office was ordered to implement it in accordance with the regulations. On that day, the pigs slaughtered in the south and north of the city were not allowed to leave the factory because they had not purchased tax tickets. After 4 p.m., the meat shops in the south of the city purchased tickets from the collection office and took the pigs out of the factory. However, the meat shops in the north of the city still ignored it. After 5 p.m., the Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter (already seen in the previous report). This bureau believed that the Chamber of Commerce was acting as a mediator and calculated the amount of tax owed. Since the Municipal Chamber of Commerce was responsible for recovering it, the collection office was immediately ordered to release the pigs stored in the factory first and temporarily count them before the 15th of this month. It was hoped that given time, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce would earnestly guide them and would not be deceived by villains again. On the 13th, it was suddenly seen in the newspaper that the Fresh Meat Industry Association had resolved to request the municipal government not to execute the buying of tickets and paying taxes, otherwise, they would unanimously close their businesses, etc. At the same time, it was reported that the number of pigs slaughtered in various slaughterhouses in the south and north of the city on the 14th of this month exceeded the usual number by one or two times, with the intention of striking. It is obviously visible that this bureau's takeover of the slaughter tax has not increased the burden on the meat industry. However, after repeated consultations against it, they did not hesitate to use the strike as a means of coercion. The reason for this is nothing more than a few villains who are playing tricks in order to restore the contractor system and achieve their desire to control and monopolize it. Everyone knows that the contractor system is easy to cause abuses. Under the revolutionary government, it cannot be allowed to exist forever, leaving a social stain. This bureau believes that directly handling all collections is to eliminate the interests of a few contractors and increase public revenue. In other words, the donations and taxes paid by the citizens are used as much as possible for municipal administration and are no longer pocketed by the contractors. Therefore, with this kind of reform determination, there is no slightest fear of difficulty. It is hoped that the meat merchants will not be fooled by a small number of people and suffer losses in vain, it is said.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ship Caused Another Disaster</h3>
<p>Sakimaru Collided with Xinming</p>
<p>In recent years, Japanese ships have been charging and colliding on the sea surface of our country, causing disasters from time to time. Although negotiations have been conducted, there have been few results. Now there is another incident of a Japanese ship colliding with a Chinese ship. We will urgently investigate and record what we have learned as follows: Xinming Was Hit　The China Merchants Bureau's northern line Xinming</p>
<p>ship was going from Shanghai to Tianjin this time. On the 13th, when the ship arrived at Dagukou, it was preparing to enter Tanggu and sail into Baihe to stop at Zizhu Forest. Suddenly, a Japanese merchant ship named Sakimaru came head-on. The captain of the Xinming ship tried to avoid the collision according to the sea route, but the Japanese ship directly crashed into the Xinming ship at close range. Fortunately, Xinming evaded urgently to avoid a major disaster. However, the stern of the ship had been hit, and the supports were damaged. Fortunately, the cargo and passengers were safe and sound.</p>
<p>Towed to Tianjin for Repairs　After Xinming was hit, the Tianjin branch</p>
<p>sent a ship to tow the ship into Tanggu and immediately reported to Tianjin Customs, which sent personnel to inspect and verify to prove that the Japanese ship caused the accident and should be fully responsible. After verification, workers were hired to repair it first. On the other hand, the ship reported the situation of the collision to the head office, opened a loss sheet, and demanded compensation from the Japanese ship.</p>
<h3>All Sectors Support the People's Conference's Declaration on Treaty Abolition</h3>
<p>Eighth District Party Department　(Omission of Titles) Sirs, the imperialists use unequal treaties as amulets to deceive our foolishness and weakness, slaughter and divide us, reduce our country to a semi-colony, and put our nation on the brink of extinction. The oppression and pain we have suffered are truly unbearable. Now our National Conference, with a decisive attitude, following the example of Russia, makes a declaration of automatic treaty abolition to lift the shackles of national survival and wash away the stain of modern civilization. The news has spread, and the world is rejoicing. Sovereignty is complete, and justice is proclaimed. If the imperialists still hope to use their remaining power that is about to collapse to hinder the realization of our goals, the party department in this district vows to lead its party members and the people in this district to sincerely support this declaration, unanimously be the government's backing, and not care about any major sacrifices. We especially hope that all compatriots in the country will rise up to fight for the survival of the nation. We respectfully send a telegram to report it. We hope you will examine it. The Eighth District Party Department of the Kuomintang Shanghai Special Municipality bows and deletes,</p>
<p>Citizens' Federation　The Special District Citizens' Federation telegraphed the National Conference yesterday, saying, "To the public view of all representatives of the Nanjing National Conference, we have read the declaration of treaty abolition on the 13th. The righteousness is correct, and the words are strict. All parties praised it. All people in the world who have peaceful knowledge and understand justice, who are not violent and barbaric, will be happy to accept it and express sympathy. Then the entire citizens of the Republic of China respectfully support each other and ascend to Datong together. If there are countries and nations that oppose peace and justice and are willing to be violent and barbaric, then the entire citizens of the Republic of China should unite in one mind and work hard to defend them for the sake of self-defense, self-preservation, equality, and peace. The citizens of the special district of Shanghai should devote their loyalty and unanimously support this declaration. We respectfully send a telegram to report it. We respectfully ask for your examination. The Preparatory Committee of the Citizens' Federation of the Special District of Shanghai bows,</p>
<h3>British Minister Scheduled to Enter Beijing Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Discussions Have Been Held in Shanghai for Several Days</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that after British Minister Lampson arrived in Shanghai on Wednesday, he met with British officials and businessmen for several days to discuss important matters related to the future of British expatriates in China. Yesterday (the 14th) morning, he met with the Joint Committee of the British Chamber of Commerce and the China Association in the British office. However, the details of the discussion are still kept secret. On Saturday evening, British Consul General Brenan will host a banquet in the office to welcome Lampson and invite naval and army officers, representatives of British expatriate organizations, and Sir Sassoon to accompany him. It is expected that at that time, important issues will be discussed and opinions will be exchanged.

It is heard that General Kelly will go to Hankou tomorrow (the 16th) to inspect the British ships on the Yangtze River. The date for the British minister to go to Beijing has been set for Sunday morning. Taishu Mann and other staff will also travel together so that they can continue the legal negotiations with Minister Wang after arriving in Beijing, it is said.</p>
<h3>Prelude to Convening an International Silver Conference</h3>
<p>Bei Sung-sun Has Arrived in London</p>
<p>Scheduled to Return to China in Mid-Next Month</p>
<p>The case of convening an international silver conference proposed by our country's representatives, which was passed by the Fifth International Chamber of Commerce Congress, has been actively pursued by the two representatives, Bei and Li, who are traveling abroad. The reporter from the National News Agency learned about the news about this matter yesterday and compiled it as follows:</p>
<p>Representative Bei Has Arrived in London　Representative Bei Sung-sun,</p>
<p>believing that this case is of great importance, and the American representatives once expressed their unwillingness to take the lead, specially visited Secretary of State Stimson to make earnest negotiations and hoped for understanding. It has now been completed. According to Lin Kanghou, chairman of the National Federation of Commerce, Representative Bei has now arrived in London, the capital of England, and plans to make similar efforts to the British government. His return to China is expected to be in mid-June, it is said. The Conference Date Is Set for This Winter　The reporter also asked Lin</p>
<p>how to proceed after Bei returns to China. Lin said, "All progress on this case must wait until representatives such as Bei return to China before we can make efforts. However, this matter is of great importance to the country, so we must ask the government for instructions. The conference date will be after the Pacific Conference this year, around November. The venue is tentatively in Shanghai. Countries Involved Will Participate　The countries</p>
<p>most affected by the low silver price are China, Britain, the United States, Japan, France, Germany, India, and Mexico. It is heard that when the future conference is implemented, there is no doubt that the above countries will participate.</p>
<h3>This Year's International Agricultural Conference</h3>
<p>Will Be Held in the Czech Republic in Mid-June</p>
<p>Czech Minister Sends a Letter Inviting Our Country to Participate</p>
<p>The 15th International Agricultural Conference is scheduled to be held in Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic, from June 5th to 8th this year.

<h3>Yixian Warship Trial Voyage to Minhang</h3>
<p>The Speed Can Be 18 Miles Per Hour</p>
<p>Since the Yixian warship was launched, it has been nearly half a year, and the internal and external installations have been completed. It is scheduled to be compiled on June 1st and made</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Trial Voyage of the Yixian Warship (Captured by Chunghua)</h3>
<p>as the light cruiser of the First Fleet. It is learned that the ship departed at 7 a.m. yesterday, accompanied by Chief Supervisor Li Shijia, Captain Chen Hongtai of the ship, Deputy Director Chen Zaofan of the shipbuilding plant, and various supervisors. They boarded the ship and sailed to the Minhang Longhua area for a test run. The average speed, after testing three times upstream and downstream, was 15 nautical miles per hour. According to the ship's supervisor, the maximum speed could not be opened today due to the small water in Longhua, but the results were already good. Ten days later, it will be sailed to the Wusongkou for a trial voyage again. The average speed is expected to be more than 18 miles. Vice Minister Chen (Shaokuan) was unable to come to Shanghai to participate due to busy reviewing matters in Beijing.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Unemployed in Jambi Cannot Return to China</h3>
<p>China Merchants Bureau Has No Ship to Send</p>
<p>More than 350 unemployed overseas Chinese in Jambi are cut off from their livelihood and urgently need to be rescued and returned to China. The Chinese consul there telegraphed the Ministry of Industry, requesting relief. It is estimated that purchasing tickets and sending these overseas Chinese back to China will require at least more than 60,000 yuan. The ministry, lacking this huge amount, consulted with the Ministry of Communications and asked them to send a ship to carry them. Wang Boqun telegraphed Shanghai, ordering the China Merchants Bureau to send a merchant ship to Jambi to carry cargo and passengers, and to rescue unemployed overseas Chinese to return to China to avoid being stranded in foreign countries. The China Merchants Bureau has repeatedly planned this case and is very willing to do its best to rescue them. The result of the discussion was that there was no ship to sail overseas, and the power and heart were violated, so it was impossible to send them. Therefore, this fact was reported to the Ministry of Communications, requesting that another method be determined.</p>
<h3>Postal Service Reduces Airmail Fees for Beijing and Tianjin</h3>

<h3>Re-election of Executive Committee of the Two-Railway Special Party Department</h3>
<p>The term of office of the previous executive committee members of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Two-Railway Special Party Department, including Min Luo, has expired. Last month, the party members of the two railways voted to re-elect them. The Central Party Department approved the Liu Weichi, Luo Panhui, Xun Chengshi, Zou Kexin, Li Dasan, and five others of the Railway Bureau as the successor executive committee members. Luo Panhui was elected by the executive committee members as a standing member of the Executive Committee and took office the day before yesterday.</p>
<h3>Kang Jiyao Telegraphed Arrival in Shaanxi</h3>
<p>The Shaanxi Disaster Relief Society received a telegram yesterday from Kang Jiyao, chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Relief Society, reporting that he had arrived in Xi'an. The text said, "Regarding Shaanxi relief, everything depends on your great efforts. Yao was recently in Shanghai and was fortunate to receive guidance, for which I am immensely grateful. Ning can be declared appropriate. I arrived in Xi'an yesterday and conveyed my warm intentions on your behalf. All sectors were deeply moved upon hearing this. Now is the time when the green and yellow are not connected, and relief is urgently needed, so it is difficult to delay any longer. I hope that Elder Ziqiao will be urged to come to Shaanxi as soon as possible to jointly supervise emergency relief and quickly convert the funds into Shaanxi to save the urgent need and achieve complete success. Kang Jiyao bows,"</p>
<h3>Starting Today, National Customs Will Collect Unified Tax on Behalf</h3>
<p>Tax Exemption Will Be Implemented Immediately</p>
<p>Restrictions on Business Tax on Cotton Yarn Merchants</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance previously believed that the resident customs offices of the Unified Tax Administration should be abolished, so it expressly ordered the administration to abolish them uniformly from May 1st. All customs procedures for collecting the unified tax on behalf of the customs will be handled by the customs. After receiving the order, the Unified Tax Administration</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>believed that the date of May 1st was too hasty, so it reported to the Ministry of Finance for approval and postponed it to today. The national customs will collect imported goods from foreign countries and non-unified tax areas that belong to the scope of the unified tax from today. The staff of the original resident customs offices of the Unified Tax Administration will be abolished from today. The Unified Tax Administration will specially give one month's salary to show compassion. In addition, Zhang Fuyun, Director of the Customs Administration, has replied to the administration yesterday that the exemption of native cloth from tax should be immediately ordered to the customs for immediate implementation. The business tax is not within the scope of the Unified Tax Administration. However, the collection of business tax on yarn mills in various places exceeds the original scope set by the central government and should be stopped by means of setting a regulation. Since merchants who buy and sell direct woven finished products are within the scope of exemption from the unified tax, they should be included in the business tax, it is said.</p>
<h3>Yarn Stored Before February Should Be Absolutely Exempted from Unified Tax</h3>
<p>The Yarn Association Requests the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Yarn Mill Association telegraphed the Ministry of Finance about the issue of unified tax on yarn stored before February 1st, requesting absolute exemption in order to maintain commercial difficulties. The original telegram said, "Minister Song of the Ministry of Finance, the unified tax exemption for yarn and cloth produced before February 1st. This association has repeatedly petitioned for an extension, which was only extended to April 15th. This inventory should not be subject to additional tax in terms of law and reason. Because the association does not dare not obey, it seems that yarn and cloth that has been shipped away from the manufacturing plant before the deadline should be allowed to pass through and cannot be asked about the ownership for the purpose of supplementing the tax or not. Otherwise, the deadline of April 15th is equivalent to setting up a false deadline. Recently, the unified tax bureaus in various provinces have been particularly demanding for this inventory, and merchants are therefore afraid, and yarn sales are completely stagnant, and the factory industry is almost impossible to maintain. We sincerely request that the ministry, thinking about commercial difficulties, quickly order the Unified Tax Administration to immediately cancel the original ownership restrictions on yarn and cloth that has been shipped away from the manufacturing plant before April 15th. The damage to the national treasury is limited, and the manufacturers are sincerely grateful for the gift. We cannot help but urgently await orders."</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Communications Sends Personnel to Inspect One or Two Foreign Telegrams</h3>
<p>Great Eastern, Great Northern, Pacific</p>
<p>Personnel Have Been Sent to Inspect Separately</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications of the National Government has now sent personnel to inspect the incoming and outgoing telegrams of the Great Eastern, Great Northern, Pacific, and other three companies in Shanghai. Chen Wende has been appointed as the inspection director of the Great Eastern Company, and Tu Taren, Chen Nianchun, and Shao Chongyuan have been appointed as inspectors.

Sun Xichen has been appointed as the inspection director of the Pacific Company, and Shao Baochun and Ye Liangbi have been appointed as inspectors. In addition, Zhu Mujie and Sun Fusen have been appointed as inspectors of the receiving and dispatching branch offices of the three companies. The Shanghai International Telecommunications Bureau has received an urgent telegram from the Ministry of Communications yesterday and immediately forwarded it to the members for them to take up their duties separately today, it is said.</p>
<h3>Negotiations on the Fire Disaster of Overseas Chinese in Tanah Grogot, Dutch East Indies</h3>
<p>The Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Requests the National Government to Allocate 30,000 Yuan First for Relief</p>
<p>On August 1st last year, a fire disaster occurred in Tanah Grogot, Dutch East Indies, which destroyed the wealth accumulated by overseas Chinese for generations, which is regrettable. However, the local government not only refused to offer a helping hand but also allowed the military and police to take the opportunity to loot. After the fire, they forced the overseas Chinese to relocate. Our innocent overseas Chinese, having suffered a fire disaster and been oppressed, were sorrowful and complained without a place to appeal. They telegraphed the Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission one after another, requesting assistance. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission forwarded the request to the National Government, ordering the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to conduct serious negotiations and allocate funds for relief. It is heard that the Ministry of Internal Affairs convened the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Finance yesterday to discuss relief measures. As a result, the Ministry of Finance will first allocate 30,000 yuan for relief. As for the one-sided section, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will be responsible for handling it.</p>
<h3>Recent News on Sino-American Shipping</h3>
<p>Kawasaki Launches Regular Service: Following its collaboration with Toyo Kisen Kaisha, the Japanese firm Kawasaki Kisen Co. has added numerous new ships. It is now introducing new routes within the Pacific, establishing a regular service between China and America. It has been decided that starting from the 24th of this month, a dedicated Shanghai-San Francisco line will be inaugurated, deploying eight 8,000-ton vessels, departing every fourteen days. The first ship scheduled is the "Ryoyo Maru." Its business focus will be on aggressively competing for the transport of Chinese exports to Japan, while also carrying American lake silk.</p>
<p>Da Lai Implements Layoffs and Retrenchment: Due to business conditions and the current situation of numerous ships but a shortage of cargo, Da Lai Shipping Company is implementing a policy of retrenchment. Previously, twenty-eight employees, including office and dock personnel, were laid off. Now, following orders from the head office, further layoffs are being conducted. Four Western employees and three Chinese employees have been dismissed. It is reported that further layoffs are expected in the near future.</p>
<h3>Bookbinding Industry Resumes Work Yesterday</h3>
<p>Booksellers Reject Price Increases</p>
<p>After the strike by bookbinding workers in the city, they resumed work yesterday as ordered. The Booksellers Association held a meeting and firmly rejected price increases, making it difficult to resolve the wage issue. The details of the situation are described below:</p>
<p>Resumption of Work: After the bookbinding workers' union issued a notice for all workers to resume work, inspection teams set out yesterday morning in all directions (east, south, west, and north). Only the workers in the Zhabei area had not resolved the wage issue and refused to resume work. After repeated persuasion by the inspectors, over two thousand workers at more than one hundred and forty binding workshops fully resumed work around 9 a.m. As for the arrested workers, they were transferred from the judicial section to the Public Security Bureau yesterday. The union will submit a petition to the Social Affairs Bureau requesting their release on bail.</p>
<p>Booksellers' Meeting: The Booksellers Association held a committee meeting yesterday afternoon at 4 p.m., attended by thirteen people including Lu Feibohong and Cheng Xiechun. Chairman Lu Feibohong addressed the letter from the Bookbinding Association requesting an increase in bookbinding prices. It was decided that the increase in binding wages in the sixteenth year of the Republic [1927] was already substantial. In recent years, raw materials have been expensive, and business has been poor, making business increasingly difficult for booksellers, to the point of being unsustainable. In the past, many finished books were wholesaled to other areas, while few unbound sheets were. In the last four years, for the sake of saving on binding costs, other areas have gradually increased their wholesale of unbound sheets. It is feared that in the future, printing and binding will both be decentralized to the provinces and not concentrated in Shanghai. Judging from the facts of recent years, the number of lithographic printing presses has already decreased by thirty or forty units. Those that remain are struggling to find work to print. If this continues, the book industry and printing houses will suffer, and the bookbinding industry will also face ruin. Therefore, it is difficult to agree to the request for increased bookbinding prices. The Bookbinding Association will be notified immediately by letter.</p>
<h3>Third Meeting of the Xin Anshan Support Association</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Support Committee for the Xin Anshan Case held its third committee meeting yesterday at the Municipal Union Association. Zheng Chengqing presided. Shao Shixing and Zheng Chengqing reported on recent negotiations with the French authorities and the municipal government. Resolutions were passed on the following items: (1) Send a letter to the French consul, urging them to realize the situation and promptly negotiate the case with our authorities. Resolution passed. (2) Appoint negotiation representatives and determine negotiation principles. Resolution passed. Zheng Chengqing, Shao Baoxing, and Dong Xinqin were appointed as representatives. The negotiation principles are as follows: (A) Xin's disability is a fait accompli, and compensation for lifelong losses of at least 10,000 yuan is demanded. (B) The involved Western police officer should be dismissed and punished according to law. (C) The French authorities should formally apologize to our government. (D) Guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future. (3) Notify friendly nations of the facts and seek public judgment. Resolution passed. (4) Wire the five representatives from the city attending the National Assembly, urging them to supervise the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to conduct serious negotiations. Resolution passed. The meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Central Government Explains That Rickshaw Pullers and Sedan Chair Carriers Cannot Form Unions</h3>
<p>The municipal government instructed the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday regarding the prohibition of rickshaw pullers and sedan chair carriers from organizing unions. The directive stated that the Ministry of Industry had consulted on a case where the Anhui Provincial Department of Construction requested clarification on whether sedan chair carriers could form a union. The case had been referred to the Training Department of the Central Executive Committee for verification and reply. The reply stated that sedan chair carriers do not have an employer-employee relationship, provide their labor, and their work is not fixed in terms of time or location. They are completely the same as rickshaw pullers, and there is no need for them to organize a union. In addition to internal distribution, it is appropriate to consult with you for reference and to instruct your subordinates to take note. This directive is issued for the bureau to take note.</p>
<h3>Italy Issues Prize-Winning Treasury Bonds</h3>

<h3>Request to Change Tooth Tax to Business Tax</h3>
<p>Petition from the Various Industries Tax Regulations Association</p>
<p>The Tax Regulations Research Committee of the Shanghai Various Industries Associations submitted a document to the municipal government yesterday, requesting that the tooth tax be changed to a business tax. The case was based on a letter from the Chicken and Duck Industry Association stating that the draft regulations for business tax rates in the city, as formulated by the Bureau of Finance, did not mention the tooth industry. However, Article 21 of the revised Regulations for Business Tax in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces by the Ministry of Finance stipulated that the tooth industry should still follow its old regulations. In the past, during the tax assessment period, tooth tax permits in the city were all provincial property, and the tax was collected by the province, which was inconsistent with the authority of the municipal administration. The current draft business tax regulations in the city do not mention the tooth industry, but if the revised regulations of the Ministry of Finance are implemented, although business tax licenses will not be charged separately out of consideration for the difficulties of businesses, for the sake of unifying matters, the tooth industry should also be included in the city's draft business tax regulations and issued business licenses. This would benefit both the municipal administration and merchants. It is requested that the municipal authorities promptly include the tooth industry in the city's draft business tax regulations to comply with the law and benefit merchants. The Ministry-promulgated Outline of Business Tax, Article 6, stipulates that after the implementation of the business tax, all existing tooth tax permits and taxes in the provinces, slaughter taxes, etc., and other taxes similar to the business tax, should be abolished. Therefore, the association's request to change the tooth tax to a business tax is in line with the tax authority of the province and city and complies with the law. It is appropriate to prepare a document based on the facts and submit it to the higher authorities for review and transfer instructions to change the tooth tax to a business tax to unify authority, which is fair and convenient.</p>
<h3>Various Industries Request Exemption or Reduction of Business Tax</h3>
<p>Silk Factories: Shen Huachen, chairman of the Shanghai Silk Factory Association, sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance of the National Government in Nanjing yesterday, stating that the implementation of the business tax in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Hubei provinces will soon begin, and it is reported that the silk and cocoon industry is included in the scope of taxation, which contradicts the Outline of Business Tax and Supplementary Measures promulgated by your ministry. There are three reasons: Article 1 of the outline stipulates that "business tax will not be levied on items that have already been subject to special taxes levied by the central government." Cocoons are the raw material for silk, and a special tax has already been levied on the transportation and sale of raw silk. Therefore, this should be exempted, first. As for the location of the cocoon market, it only involves purchasing, and there is absolutely no sales business. According to your ministry's decree No. 5754, the Shanghai Various Industries Associations Tax Regulations Research Committee sent a telegram stating, "The agents who only buy and do not sell have no business income and are naturally not subject to taxation." The cocoon market is purely a purchasing agent and has no business income. Therefore, this should be exempted, second. Article 11 of the supplementary measures stipulates that "the first step of the transitional measures is to change the tooth tax permit to a business tax, and the tax rate will be levied according to the original amount of the tooth tax." Therefore, each cocoon market pays taxes and receives permits. This should be exempted, third. The silkworm cocoon season is about to begin. It is earnestly requested that your ministry issue a telegram to the governments of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Hubei provinces to correct this and not include cocoon markets in the scope of business tax collection, so as to comply with the law and maintain commerce, which would be a great convenience.</p>
<p>Ham Industry: The Shanghai Ham Industry Association fraudulently sent a letter to the Tax Regulations Research Association, stating that ham and cured meats are the same type of food, and the collection of their business tax rate should be uniformly based on 0.2% to be fair and reasonable. Ham is made from the meat of pigs. Fresh pork is initially slaughtered, salted to become cured meat, and dried to become ham. Although the names are different, the substance is the same. Now, for the same type of food, cured meat and fresh pork are taxed at 0.2%, while ham is taxed at 1%. This is extremely unfair. I venture to submit my humble opinions as follows: (1) The process of making ham, from fresh meat to ham, involves only adding salt and the natural effects of air drying. There are no other materials mixed in. Since there are no other materials mixed in, ham and cured meat are essentially the same as fresh meat. This is one reason for the same taxation. (2) The raw material for ham is fresh meat, as mentioned above. Fresh meat spoils within one day in summer, and even in winter, it can only be preserved for a week. If salted to become cured meat, it can be preserved for three to five months. If dried and sun-dried to become ham, it can be stored for three years. Therefore, ham has a preservative effect and can be stored longer than fresh meat or cured meat. In other words, it embodies the virtues of thrift and frugality. This is a second reason for the same taxation. (3) To illustrate with vegetables, fresh green vegetables and radishes are equivalent to fresh pork. Pickled vegetables and radishes are equivalent to pickled meat. Dried vegetables and dried radishes are equivalent to dried meat like ham. Since there is no distinction between fresh, pickled, and dried vegetables, why should there be discrimination between fresh meat, cured meat, and ham? This is a third reason for the same taxation. In conclusion, the principle is clear. I urge your association to uphold justice and request the Ministry of Finance and the municipal Bureau of Finance to reduce the business tax on ham and collect it at the same rate as cured meat and fresh pork, to be fair and convenient for businesses. Respectfully submitted by the Shanghai Ham Industry Association to the Tax Regulations Research Committee of the Shanghai Various Industries Associations.</p>
<h3>Meierle and Approves Wu Liande's Opium Prohibition Measures</h3>
<p>Meierle, the Inspector-General of Customs, who has been handling customs affairs in China for many years, will express his approval of Wu Liande's opium prohibition measures in a reply letter. The original letter is recorded as follows: "In response to your letter and article 'The Poisonous Opium Problem,' I am deeply impressed by your lofty arguments and grand opinions. Opium is more harmful than fire and water. If the government does not take measures to strictly manage both production and sales, how can it be eradicated at the root? I agree with the points you raised. I am sending this reply for your information. Sincerely, Meierle, May 12."</p>
<h3>Guangji Ship Runs Aground on the Yangtze River</h3>
<p>Hull Aground: The Guangji ship, which originally sailed to Wenzhou, was recently transferred by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, joining the Hankou-Yichang line. On the 14th, the ship was carrying cargo from Hankou to the Shayichang area when it ran aground on the Yangtze River about three miles from the Coal River. Cargo must now be unloaded before it can be towed.</p>
<p>Pilot Negligence: This incident was caused by the negligence of the pilot, causing the front of the ship to run aground on a shallow bank while the rear of the ship remained in the river. The water depth in that area is nine feet. It only needs to be lifted clear of the shallow bank to sail.</p>
<p>Dispatching Workers to Unload: Yesterday, the Shanghai office received the news and ordered the Hankou branch to quickly dispatch a small tugboat to unload the cargo from the Guangji ship to reduce the weight of the forehold. Then, tow it away. It should be rescued from the shallows in a day or two, and the hull is undamaged.</p>
<h3>Recent Developments on the Two Railways</h3>
<p>Since Luo Qinshan took office as the director of the two railways, he has been diligently rectifying the railway administration. Recently, it was found that more than 10,000 mu of land along the two railways had been rented to various households for farming. These tenants often owed rent for many years, which was detrimental to railway funds. He strictly ordered the property section of the general affairs department to actively rectify the situation, list the households that owed rent monthly, and order the rent collectors to collect rent on time. Those who failed to comply or colluded to conceal the situation would be punished. Also, due to the increasing number of passengers at the Shanghai North Station, Nanxiang, Jiangwan, and Taiwan stations, passengers often did not know the ticket prices, which was inconvenient. He instructed the transportation department to install price lists for each class of tickets next to each window of the ticket office for everyone's information. Twelve long benches were added to the platform at Nanxiang Station, and electric lights were installed in the awnings at Jiangwan and Taiwan stations, making it more convenient for passengers. In addition, a section of the platform at Wuxi Station was not covered by a wooden awning, making it difficult for guards to prevent theft. He instructed the engineering department to quickly build a shed to prevent theft. Furthermore, it was found that the lead seals on freight cars were not secure, often resulting in the theft of goods, which was detrimental to the reputation of the railway. He instructed the transportation department to review the situation and adopt new-style lead seals, similar to those used on the Pinghan and Xiang-E railways, to enhance security and ensure thoroughness. Luo has been with the railways for many years and is familiar with the situation on both lines. All measures are focused on convenience for passengers. With these improvements, passengers on the two railways will benefit significantly.</p>

<h3>Wang Zhenhuan Case: Kidnappers Committed Numerous Major Crimes</h3>
<p>Three Cases of Kidnapping</p>
<p>Twelve Cases of Robbery</p>
<p>All Sentenced Separately Yesterday</p>
<p>Wang Zhenhuan, the young owner of Wang Yutai Tea Shop at No. 17 Julaida Road in the French Concession, was the victim of an attempted kidnapping. The criminals shot and killed Chinese Constable No. 2124 of the British Police Force and wounded Gatekeeper No. 1580. The criminals fled to No. 9 Zhengxingli, Beidi Road, entering through the front door and escaping through the back, abandoning a box cannon outside the back door of the house. Detectives arrived later, retrieved the weapon, and took it back to the police station to await arrest. This was previously reported. It is now known that Jin Jiulin, special detective inspector of the French Police, along with chief detective Li Yaolong, deputy detectives Qian Yumin, Mao Jingen, Zhang Ziying, and plainclothes detectives Zhou Buguang and Cai Jinzhang, discovered that the kidnappers were hiding at the Pingan Inn at No. 25 Pingjili Road. They proceeded to the inn the night before last without raising suspicion and arrested kidnappers He Yuren, Chen Xinggen, Zhu Debiao, Xue Mingshan, along with accomplice Pan Kaibang (the elder brother of the pirate Pan Kaiqu, a subordinate of Kaiqu with thousands of followers who specialize in looting on the sea outside Wusongkou), Miao Huaqing, and suspects Chen Gaoshan, Zhang Liansheng, Yu Peigui, Zhang Yishan, Tang Youting, Chen Deren, a woman named Jin Er Guniang, and Wang Sunshi, a total of fourteen individuals. They also seized a box cannon and a handgun and brought them to the police station. After interrogation by Western Detective Bao Ermao, He Yuren, Chen Xinggen, and Zhu Debiao confessed to plotting to kidnap Wang Zhenhuan and shooting and killing the Chinese constable. They also confessed that on February 8th of this year at 12:00 am, they attempted to kidnap Guangdong native Lin Weiqing, a head worker, at No. 55 Peikai'er Road in the Public Concession. On February 15th, they kidnapped Lu Mingsheng at the entrance of Leyuli on Yunnan Road, hiding the ransom note at No. 484 Fulililu. The family paid 32,000 yuan to redeem him, which was then divided among the kidnappers. In the past year and this year, they had also committed robberies in the French Concession, targeting the home of Cao Han at No. 22 Xiafei Road, the home of Ma Dongting at No. 20 Xiafei Road, the home of Cao Junda at No. 198 Pushi Road, the home of Zhang Maomao at No. 1 Lane 363 Kangti Road, Qian Fulai Nanyang Biscuit Company at No. 370 Houfuli, Bai'er Road, the home of Cao Sha II at No. 105 Fuka森 Road, Yongfeng Rice Shop at No. 180 Laoshenfu Road, the home of Wang Caimin at No. 5 Lane 94 Xiai Xian斯 Road (all robberies committed last year), the home of Zhang Jinquan at No. 455 Caishen Lane, Kangti Road, the home of Gao Yinfeng at No. 7 Tongkangli, Shengnv Yuan Road, the hosiery factory of Pan Sheng at No. 41 Anshunli, Kangti Road, and the home of Qian Longquan at No. 123 Meitaikong斯tuo Road, a total of twelve households. The order was given to detain them pending verification. Yesterday, they were sent to the French Court for prosecution. The Western Detective first reported the previous situation and presented the box cannon as evidence. Then, the plaintiffs complained about the circumstances of the robberies. Lu Liankui, a detective from the Chief Inspector's Office of the British Police Force, also filed a case, requesting that the four criminals, including He, be transferred for interrogation. He Yuren, Chen Xinggen, Zhu Debiao, and Xue Mingshan confessed to forming a gang to commit robberies and successively kidnapping victims, resisting arrest and committing violence. Pan Kaibang confessed that he was not present at the scene of the kidnappings, but that he had conspired to rob a certain store in Baxianqiao, which was unsuccessful, and was arrested by detectives. Miao Huaqing confessed that he was invited by Pan Kaibang to rob a certain store, and that he was not aware of the previous robberies. Chen Gaoshan, Zhang Liansheng, and others confessed that although they were acquainted with He Yuren and others, they did not know that they were thieves and requested a thorough investigation. Judge Zhu, the French Consul, sentenced He Yuren, Chen Xinggen, Zhu Debiao, and Xue Mingshan to five years in the Western Prison, to be deported after serving their time, and to be handed over to the mainland authorities for interrogation. They were first sent to the Public Concession Police Station for interrogation. Pan Kaibang was sentenced to three years, and Miao Huaqing to two years. Upon completion of their sentences, they will be permanently expelled from the Concession. Chen Deren, Jin Er Guniang, and Wang Sunshi were released as they were not involved. Chen Gaoshan and the other five were all expelled from the country. The seized box cannon and handgun were confiscated.</p>
<h3>Pliers Used as Handgun</h3>
<p>Li Buxin Specializes in Petty Crimes</p>
<p>Zhang Wenkui's Wife Saw Through the Fake</p>
<p>Zhang Wenkui, a local, 45 years old, operates a Yingyu Cigarette and Paper Store at No. 17 Nanjing Street in Nanshi. Around 9:00 pm the night before last, two robbers suddenly entered the store. Both were wearing blue cloth short shirts and pants and spoke with a Jiangbei accent. One robber brandished a black handgun, driving Zhang and his wife into a corner and warning them not to make a sound. The other robber then grabbed nine yuan in silver dollars and fourteen cents in small coins from the counter and fled out the door with the loot. As the robber holding the gun was about to escape, Zhang's wife realized that the black handgun was not real but a pair of iron pliers, with the handles hidden inside the sleeves. The middle section was being gripped, and the pliers head was exposed, resembling a handgun. It was originally intended to scare people. At this point, she felt a surge of courage and grabbed the robber from behind, shouting "Catch the robber!" Liu Xueqing, a watchman from the 24th patrol post nearby, and Yin Wanyou, a watchman from the 23rd patrol post, heard the commotion and arrived, managing to capture the robber. He was taken back to the First Precinct of the First District. During the preliminary interrogation by the station chief, the robber confessed his name was Li Buxin, 29 years old, from Funing, residing in Caonitang, Pudong. He claimed that he was experiencing financial difficulties, so he and his friend Ji Agen brought iron pliers to use as a fake handgun for intimidation. He did not expect to be arrested. He also stated that he and Ji had committed a robbery on a ship at Laiyi Wharf last month, obtaining five and a half yuan in silver dollars, and that ten days prior, they had also robbed a cigarette and paper store at the eastern end of Qinglong Bridge, obtaining five yuan in silver dollars and one hundred and eighty cents in small coins. Ji was also present. All the things they did were small-scale crimes, and the stolen money had already been divided and spent. As the matter involved robbery, he was ordered to prepare a document to be submitted to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Two Westerners Accuse Each Other</h3>
<p>A Major Dispute Over 200 Yuan</p>
<p>Involving Chinese Clerk Xuan Jinrong</p>
<p>Around 8:00 pm the evening before last (the 14th), a drunken Westerner took a train from Shanghai to Wusong and disembarked at Paotaiwan. He was staggering and claimed he wanted to go to the Feili Steamship Company to board a ship to Hankou. Chen Yinfu, a tea boy from the Seaside Hotel, was at the station picking up guests. The stationmaster Wu ordered Chen to take him to the Feili Company. Because it was late, there were no ships departing, so the company refused. Chen felt it was not his responsibility, so he returned to the hotel. Unexpectedly, after being rejected by the company, the Westerner ran around on the seaside until about 1:30 am yesterday morning. He went back to the Feili Company and knocked on the door. Xuan Jinrong, a Chinese clerk at the company, heard the noise and opened the door. The Westerner broke into the room and insisted on staying overnight. Xuan told him that this was not a hotel and he could not stay. Unexpectedly, the Westerner fell to the ground and fell sound asleep. The clerk had no choice but to let him be. When the Westerner woke up around 7:00 am yesterday morning, he got up from the ground and suddenly appeared alarmed, claiming that a wallet in his pocket, containing 200 yuan in banknotes, had disappeared. He accused Xuan of stealing it, and the two began arguing and were taken to the 7th District of the Public Security Bureau. Officer Cheng of the district interrogated them. The Westerner stated his name was Harder Peterson, 42 years old, originally from Norway but later an American citizen. He was currently the chief engineer of a Dutch steamship in Hankou. He came to Song from Shanghai last night and went to the Feili Company to borrow a room. He took out the 200 yuan in his wallet at that time and showed it to them. It was taken from Mitsui 洋行. 100 yuan was the company's public funds, and 100 yuan was for his personal use. They were all 10-yuan banknotes. He discovered the theft at 6:00 am this morning. Only Xuan saw it, so he concluded that Xuan had stolen it. Xuan stated that he was 60 years old and from Chongming. Around 8:00 pm last night, Chen Yinfu brought the Westerner to the company and said that he wanted to take a ship to Hankou. Because there were no ships, Mr. Zhang, the translator in the company, told me to close the door and ignore him. After the Westerner left, he came back to knock on the door at 1:30 am, insisted on staying, and fell asleep on the ground, refusing to get up. When he woke up at 7:00 am this morning, he falsely accused me of stealing 200 yuan and was very aggressive. While the interrogation was in progress, Mike, a British employee of the Feili Company, also filed a case, stating that Xuan Jinrong had been a Chinese clerk in the company for more than ten years and was very loyal. He could be held responsible for guaranteeing that he would not be a thief. Peterson broke into the company late at night without permission, which was illegal, so he filed a counterclaim and asked that it be investigated according to the laws of your country. Officer Cheng reviewed the confessions and found that the two Westerners' statements were inconsistent and the case was complicated. He immediately reported to District Chief Zhao Zezhou, who sent all the witnesses to the Public Security Bureau for legal action at 4:00 pm yesterday.</p>

<h3>Dagillie Massacre Summons Scheduled</h3>
<p>Regarding the Dagillie Massacre, the issue of court jurisdiction was previously fought for by the victim's family, Cai Jinchun, and others, who entrusted lawyer Yan Lunkui to the Shanghai Local Court. It is now heard that a satisfactory solution has been reached, and it is also heard that the court summoned some of the victims' families yesterday.</p>
<h3>Negotiation on Unauthorized Carriage of Foreigners by Ferry</h3>
<p>A few days ago, the Passport Inspection Office of the Second Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau received a telegram from the Wusong Office stating that the Asiamar Oil Company's Si Mai (transliteration) steamer had arrived in Wusong today. Deputy Director Chen Timin went to the scene with inspectors Zhou Chunyue and others, and together with customs and quarantine officers, took a small boat to inspect the Si Mai steamer. However, upon arrival, they saw a lighter alongside the steamer and luggage being unloaded from the large steamer onto the lighter. At that time, the Si Mai large steamer was flying a yellow flag. According to regulations, a yellow flag indicates that quarantine has not yet been carried out, and passengers on the steamer are not allowed to disembark. Director Chen believed that the small boat had violated regulations by taking passengers and luggage without waiting for quarantine and passport inspection, so he went to inspect the small boat. He found one passenger and more than ten pieces of luggage in the cabin. The passenger was from Norway and had come to China on the Si Mai. Although he had a passport, it had not been endorsed by the Chinese embassy abroad. He was ordered to fill out a registration form, declare three pieces of luggage, and go to the Public Security Bureau for endorsement. It was then learned that the violating small boat was a boat of the British-owned Wusong Ferry Company that was picking up pilots and passengers. He was questioned why the company had violated regulations and disrupted work, undermining friendly relations, as the Municipal Public Security Bureau had notified the consulates of various countries in Shanghai, through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' note to the ministers of various countries and the letter from the Municipal Government and the Public Security Bureau, that passengers were not allowed to disembark until the passports of foreign ships entering the country had been inspected. If a passenger without a passport or a wanted criminal was smuggled into the country, who would be responsible? Since this was the responsibility of his position, it was difficult to forgive. The violating ferry was detained. Subsequently, someone came forward to mediate, claiming that the passengers on the ferry were not passengers but pilots. However, according to the passenger's own registration form, he came to China from Norway and brought three pieces of luggage. The evidence was conclusive and there was no room for denial. It is reported that the matter has been reported to the Public Security Bureau, and the Municipal Government has been requested to seriously negotiate with the consulate in charge and punish them.</p>

<h3>Preliminary Hearing in the Woman's Strangulation Case</h3>
<p>Xu Lu, a woman who lived in front of the Minli Middle School on Zhonghua Road, was strangled to death on the night of March 12th this year. The local court detained the suspects Qiao Fusheng and Ling Xingen. Prosecutor Wu paid close attention to the case and conducted a thorough investigation. In addition to numerous detailed investigations, yesterday he summoned Qiao Fusheng's maid, A Lin, Chen Taohan, Tao, Zhou Qiantai, Wu Xigui, and the deceased's ten-year-old daughter Da Xin and eight-year-old son Jinglu, to the preliminary hearing. It was reported that A Lin stated that she lived next to the escalator, and Qiao Fusheng had to pass her door when he went out. Zhou Qiantai stated that he lived downstairs, and anyone who walked past would have to pass this way. Chen Tao Tao claimed that he slept on a cot at the front door, and anyone entering or leaving at night would have to be opened by him. The official asked if Qiao had gone out on March 12, which was the 23rd night of the first lunar month. They all said that he did not go out. The official then asked the ten-year-old girl and eight-year-old boy, who slept with their mother, if they knew who had harmed their mother. They answered that they were asleep and did not know. Therefore, it is still difficult to identify the murderer. The official ordered them to be dismissed and to wait for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Dispute Over the Disappearance of the Village Girl Lianlian</h3>
<p>Wang Wenlan Has Major Suspicions</p>
<p>Chen Guangfu, a 55-year-old man from Tongzhou, has been working as a farmer in his hometown. He has a daughter named Lianlian, who is now 19 years old. Since childhood, she has been betrothed to the son of Ji Hejun, a fellow villager, but she has not yet married. Unexpectedly, Lianlian suddenly disappeared on the 15th day of the third lunar month this year. After searching everywhere without success, it was discovered that she was abducted to Shanghai by Wang Yun, a fellow villager. Chen, along with his future father-in-law Ji Hejun, came to Shanghai by boat during the past week and stayed at 7 Yong'an Lane, Yong'an Street, in the French Concession, at the residence of Ji Xichang (Ji's nephew). Every day they went out to inquire about Lianlian's whereabouts, but without any news. A few days ago, a man named Wang Wenlan, also from Tongzhou, contacted Chen. Wang claimed to be familiar with Shanghai and offered to help find her, assuring them that he was confident. However, he first asked for six yuan for travel expenses. Chen readily agreed and paid the money. Unexpectedly, for several days in a row, there was still no sign of Lianlian. Chen then realized he had been fooled. Yesterday, he twisted Wang Wenlan over to the police in Lujiazhai, Pudong, who took him to the third district of the Public Security Bureau. Chen explained the circumstances of his daughter's elopement. Wang Wenlan confessed that he was 24 years old, lived in Wufu Road, Lujiazhai, Pudong, and was engaged in a small business. Because he had a fellow villager relationship with Chen Guangfu and Ji Hejun, they entrusted him to help find Lianlian, and they did give him six yuan for travel expenses. However, the money was stolen by a pickpocket on the way. The district chief questioned him about whether he knew the whereabouts of Chen's daughter. He was vague. Chen Guangfu further stated that the abductor, Wang Yun, was Wang Wenlan's uncle and that he had a strong suspicion of helping to abduct her. As the case was related to a criminal matter, in the afternoon it was judged to transfer the group to the local court for disposal.</p>
<h3>A Large Batch of Smuggled Salt Seized</h3>
<p>A Large Bamboo Mat Boat</p>
<p>Containing More Than 300 Bags of Salt</p>
<p>Yu Qiutang, captain of the first brigade of the Wusong Su Wu Salt Smuggling Enforcement Team, together with Xu Wenyou, patrol captain of the second brigade, and others, led their officers and men on patrol boats in the outer waters of Chuansha at about 7:30 AM the day before yesterday. They spotted a bamboo mat boat parked at the Beigang Estuary. The captains suspected the boat and went forward to search it. Unexpectedly, as they approached the boat, two people jumped ashore and fled west. They detained the boat and seized a large batch of smuggled salt in the cabin, totaling more than 300 bags. After being informed, captains Li and Xie reported to Director Song of the General Bureau yesterday and removed the smuggled salt from the boat and sent it to Chuansha Salt Depot for temporary storage, pending further action.</p>
<h3>Chinese Detective Involved in Morphine Robbery Case on Kele Road - Continued Hearing</h3>
<p>Liang Chengyu, a Chinese detective of the Public Concession General Patrol Room, was recently accused by the police of stealing a large amount of morphine. On the morning of the 6th of this month, Western Inspector Yao Ke, General Detective Lu Liankui, and Detective Liu Shaokui of the Inspectorate escorted Liang to the Second Criminal Court of the Special District Local Court for trial. The facts of the accusation were that at 7:00 AM on the 28th of last month, seven robbers suddenly came to a company at 1 Wende Lane, Kele Road, in the French Concession, and robbed morphine worth 50,000 yuan. The stolen goods were later brought into the Public Concession and first placed on Dagu Road, then moved to Danshui Road, and finally hidden in the home of Li Liansheng at 439 Laomale Lane, Chongqing Road. Li was one of the seven robbers who robbed on Kele Road. That evening at 11:00 PM, six bandits came to Li Liansheng's house and robbed all the morphine. Liang Chengyu, a Chinese detective, was accused of being one of the six thieves. After the police arrested Liang, they had Li Liansheng and his concubine identify him as one of the robbers, which was confirmed. This was detailed in the newspaper on the 7th of this month. Yesterday afternoon, it was time for the continued hearing of the case. The defendant's lawyers Ye Fukang, Yuan Yang'an, and others also appeared in court. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin rose and stated that the case was of great importance and complex. Many people were present in the courtroom, which may slightly hinder the trial. Therefore, he requested to prohibit the audience. Judge Ge Zhiqin approved the request, so all people who were not related to the case were ordered to leave the courtroom. Lawyer Zhang then continued that the police had conducted a detailed investigation during the adjournment and learned that after Li Liansheng and others robbed the morphine from Kele Road, they first hid it at 562 Dagu Road, from 7:10 AM to 7:30 AM, and then moved it to the building at 1500 Hexing Lane, Edward Road. The house was rented by Zhou Fangting. At 9:30 AM, they moved it to 382.5 Defu Lane, Mahuo Road, until 5:00 PM, when they moved it to Male Lane, Chongqing Road. It was robbed that night. Now Dong Lanting and others have been arrested. Please question them. Dong Lanting testified that he was from Ningbo and lived at 7 Fudeli, Edward Road. He was friends with Liang Chengyu. He often came to my house to play. Before May 1st, one evening, Liang received a telegram from Shandong that his father had passed away. He came to my place and said that he wanted to ask for leave to return home. The next evening at 9:00 PM, he talked with Liang at Yao Jinlong's place at 349 Shengping Lane in the French Concession for about two or three hours before they parted ways. The witness Zhou Qu testified that on the afternoon of April 28th, Li Liansheng and his wife came to Male Lane to rent the remaining parlor room in my house. They stated that the monthly rent was 18 yuan. They moved in soon after. In the evening, four people entered through the back door and went straight into the parlor room, claiming to visit Li Liansheng. They did not leave late at night. The next day, I told Li Liansheng that I was terminating the lease. I don't know anything else. The witnesses, women Yang Dai and Zhang Kong, and others also complained. The defendant Liang Chengyu was questioned and still insisted that he did not commit the morphine robbery, and claimed that on that night, he and Dong Lanting went to the French Concession to investigate the party member Xiao Jiang, Wang Zilian and Fang Liansheng, of the Li Huiqing kidnapping case, who was Li Liansheng. Judge Ge verified the testimonies and ordered the defendant to be returned to custody and to wait for the continued hearing on the afternoon of May 26th.</p>
<h3>News of the Performance at the Xie Residence in Jianlu</h3>
<p>Xie Baosheng, a well-known figure in Shanghai, will be 50 years old on the 16th. It is said that he has received many congratulatory messages from all walks of life. Famous opera enthusiasts in Shanghai have also jointly organized a grand performance to celebrate his birthday. Figures such as Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, Yuan Ludeng, He Wuliang, Zhou Jianyun, Qiu Jianfei, and Rong Boming will all gather together, each performing their best pieces. The most remarkable thing is that Mr. Cheng Junmou, who gained a very big reputation when performing in Tianjin last year, and who was claimed by newspapers as the successor of Tan Xinpei, coincidentally came to Shanghai to visit relatives, and he has also agreed to participate in the performance. The play is a full version of "The Empty City Stratagem." Many opera performers in Shanghai admired his skill. This time, Cheng generously took the stage because he was a close friend of Xie. It is considered a rare opportunity, and everyone is eagerly waiting to see his masterpiece.</p>

<p>Incoming Mail</p>
<h3>Letter from Fan Fayuan et al. to Hu Shuhua</h3>
<p>Fan Fayuan et al. wrote to Hu Shuhua, the Shanghai representative to the National Assembly, regarding traditional Chinese medicine: "Mr. Shuhua, greetings. We rushed to the capital a few days ago, intending to unite with colleagues to hold a meeting to welcome you upon your arrival in Beijing, to express our long-standing intentions. Upon hearing that you had already traveled north, we were only able to promote your return to Shanghai due to business constraints and urgent telegrams. We were unable to achieve our purpose and regret it to this day. Recently, we read in the Shanghai Shen Xin newspapers in the local news column an article that the Shanghai Medical Association petitioned you to submit a proposal to the National Assembly. The general idea is: (1) Please ask the government to establish Western medical schools and hospitals everywhere, and designate Western medicine as the national medicine of the Republic of China. (2) Falsely accuse traditional Chinese medicine of violating science, limit traditional Chinese medicine to a one-time registration, so that no more traditional Chinese medicine practitioners will be allowed to be produced in the future. (3) To organize and manage traditional Chinese medicine with Western medicine, and so on, and only send Pang Jingzhou as a representative to go to Beijing to negotiate. Although on the surface it claims to be for the country and the people, its purpose is to eliminate our country's inherent medicine. Colleagues in both the traditional Chinese medicine and traditional Chinese medicine industries have been running around alarmed, and the public is indignant. If such a proposal is unfortunately passed, I am afraid that not only will traditional Chinese medicine and traditional Chinese medicine go bankrupt from now on, but the loss to the country will also be unbearable. Now the relationship between interests and harms is briefly stated separately below, and I hope that you will be informed. (1) Establishing Western medical schools and hospitals everywhere is not only beyond the financial resources of the country recently, but also the gains are not worth the losses. Why do we say this? All the instruments and medicines used by Western medicine now need to be supplied from foreign countries. Some say that 'Western medicine in China is like a foreign medicine salesperson disguised as a mailman.' Considering the actual situation, it is not an exaggeration. Establishing one more Western medical school will cultivate several more 'foreign drug salesmen.' Shouldn't Western medicine practitioners with a little patriotism do their best to promote the imitation and manufacture of foreign medicines and machinery? Is it true that scientists do not need to consider the national economy? The national economy is the lifeblood of the country. Every penny that flows out means a loss of the national lifeblood. According to the current Chinese medicine, there are no more than 10,000 people, and the annual import of foreign drugs has reached more than 200 million yuan. A little consideration is enough to shock people. If we vigorously promote Western medical schools and hospitals all over the country before we can produce Western medicine in our country, even if traditional Chinese medicine cannot cure a single disease, even if Western medicine is truly omnipotent and cures all diseases, I am afraid that the people's diseases will be cured, and the country's lifeblood will be cut off. Is it like scientific principles to seek for the people but not for the country? As for asking to designate Western medicine as the Chinese national medicine, it is even more nonsense. According to the association's previous article opposing the central government's establishment of a 'National Medical Center' to lead the organization of traditional Chinese medicine, it said, (Medicine is the common property of the world, and academic studies should not have national boundaries,) and then said, (Before traditional Chinese medicine has been organized and completed to become an independent oriental medicine, it should not be called national medicine,) 'extracting the original meaning,' etc. Not long ago, unexpectedly, in the blink of an eye, they were willing to give up the names of new medicine practitioners and ask to call themselves national medicine practitioners. Is it because their medical knowledge knows that it cannot be shared with the world, and can only be called national medicine? Or has Chinese medicine in China recently become an independent oriental medicine? Its contradiction and ridiculousness are truly difficult to understand. According to the members of the association, some graduated from domestic schools, and some studied in England, America, Germany, France, and Japan. Should we call the former Chinese medicine practitioners, or the latter Chinese medicine practitioners, or both Chinese medicine practitioners? The lectures are all in foreign languages, and the supplies are all foreign goods. To call this 'national' is like calling imported goods domestic goods, and Western clothes national clothes, which is no different from robbing others of their beauty and making the world laugh. And since there is Chinese medicine, there cannot be Chinese medicine. Since Western medicine is Chinese medicine, is Western medicine Chinese medicine? Those who boast of being new medicine and call themselves scientists, have this kind of view, so it is no wonder that old medicine does not know science. (2) Science cannot be separated from facts, and separation from facts is not science. The main purpose of medicine is to cure diseases. Whether traditional Chinese medicine can cure diseases, whether its curative effect is inferior to Western medicine, and whether traditional Chinese medicine has a necessity and possibility to be limited, sensible people will have a fair opinion. Only arguing for the name of science without arguing for the fact of curing diseases is already a dispute that violates science. Moreover, Western medicine is Western medicine, Chinese medicine is Chinese medicine, each treats its own affairs, and there is no mutual obstruction at first. Chinese medicine is not an obstacle to Western medicine. Why does Western medicine deliberately want Chinese medicine to be destroyed and then quickly? Whether this kind of expression is in line with science is not discussed for the time being. Whether a Western medicine professional group publicly requests the elimination of Chinese medicine exceeds the scope and has ulterior motives, everyone knows. The traditional Chinese medicine community will not bother to argue with it about academic theories. The reason why Japan does not value traditional Chinese medicine is that traditional Chinese medicine in Japan, like Western medicine, is imported from Japan. Moreover, it was easy to send people to learn Western medicine at that time, but it was difficult to send people to master Chinese medicine. It is also not difficult to manufacture artificial Western medicine, but it is not easy to produce natural Chinese medicine. For the sake of the people, both Western medicine and traditional Chinese medicine are acceptable. For the sake of the country, we have to limit the imperial Chinese medicine. The Chinese medicine of our country is our own, and the agriculture, industry, and commerce of Chinese medicine are in the tens of millions. The situation is exactly the opposite. How can we cite it as an example? Moreover, Japan's crackdown on Chinese medicine was still decades ago. What is the situation of Chinese medicine today? Both the upper and lower levels are trying to revitalize it, and the parliament is also on the agenda. Why does the association only know what is far away and not what is near, or know what is near and deliberately abandon it? In short, the theory of limiting Chinese medicine to a one-time registration is enough to put the Republic of China in a state of economic downturn. It is truly a heresy that is not in line with national conditions, hinders people's livelihood, and violates scientific principles. (3) The academic theories of Chinese medicine and Western medicine are different. Organizing Chinese medicine with Western medicine is like using a coachman as a construction engineer. The result must be the opposite of the purpose and is unimaginable. Chinese medicine theories are mostly formed after experience. Chinese medicine theories must be organized. Chinese medicine experience will never die. The strength of Chinese medicine lies in having another experience. The weakness of Chinese medicine lies in the inconsistency between the theory and experience. Therefore, if you want to organize Chinese medicine, you must use its experience as a tool for organization, and you must never use Western medicine theory as a standard for organization, because the starting points are completely different. Looking around at Chinese medicine in our country, there are few who have Chinese medicine theories, and even fewer who have Chinese medicine experience. If Western medicine practitioners who have no experience in Chinese medicine are responsible for organizing Chinese medicine, does it mean using their Chinese medicine theories to organize it? Chinese medicine will never be successful. Does it mean using their Western medicine knowledge to organize Chinese medicine? If you do not completely change Chinese medicine into Western medicine, you will lead Chinese medicine to a path that is neither donkey nor horse. Losing the true face of Chinese medicine and destroying the true value of Chinese medicine is the same. Moreover, there is even more progress. In this proposal of the association, first, it said that old medicine uses unscientific bases, performs incomplete methods, and advocates abandonment, which is reasonable.... Then, it said that scientific medical experts should be hired to study old medicine, so that they can organize old medical techniques, hoping to eliminate the false and preserve the true, and preserve the national heritage.... According to the former statement, old medicine is useless, and abandoning it is not a pity. According to the latter statement, old medicine still has true things that can be preserved and the value of national heritage. The inconsistency between the former and latter is so serious that a scientist dares to send this contradictory statement to the sacred and solemn National Assembly. What is their intention? What is their value? Clear and wise as you, sir, will definitely be able to see through their bottom line and see through their treachery. The essence of medicine for more than 4,000 years, and the three million traditional Chinese medicine and commercial workers, the survival and destruction are not only related to the people's livelihood, but also related to the nation. I hope that you, sir, will use your usual aspirations for love to lend a hand in this critical moment, and find a way to dispel the above-mentioned proposals by the Shanghai Medical Association that are harmful to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and refuse to submit them. I respectfully ask all traditional Chinese medicine colleagues across the country to bow their heads and make a request. I hope that you will give us guidance at any time. This is the honor and good fortune. Sincerely, Fan Fayuan, Gu Weichuan, Cai Jiping, Shen Zhuoru, Cheng Diren, Xu Xiangren, and others."</p>

<h3>Record of the Words and Deeds of Zhao Guantao's Respected Father</h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>Zhao Guantao, the current commander of the Sixth Division of the Army stationed in Xinyang, Henan, is a native of Sheng County, Zhejiang. His home is located in Taoyuan Township, at the foot of Mount Duxiu, and he is from the same hometown as Wang Xiaolai, the chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. The two families are only a few miles apart, so Mr. Wang knows his family history very well. According to him, Commander Zhao's respected father, Mr. Shi Gao, is highly regarded in his hometown. His words and deeds throughout his life are sufficient as a model for future generations. Therefore, I have extracted a few examples to substantiate this discussion.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhao's given name was Hongxiang, and his courtesy name was Shi Gao. He was born when the Taiping Rebellion began. His father and elder brother were captured, and his mother also passed away early. He was raised by his uncle. At the age of nine, he entered a private school and studied several hundred words of Confucian classics daily. Due to poverty and famine, he could not afford the tuition. He went out to tend cattle. As he grew older, he possessed great strength and was skilled in riding and archery. He took the county examination and entered the military academy as the top candidate. He once took the provincial examination, but his horse stumbled, and he failed the examination. He then gave up all intention of seeking advancement. When the local bandits, led by Wu Dai, caused turmoil, threatening the city, the county magistrate was unable to help. The local gentry gathered for discussions day and night, but could not come up with a solution. Mr. Zhao requested strict defense and personally went to the provincial capital to request reinforcements. He presented his case to the authorities, who then dispatched troops. He made decisive plans and did not sleep day or night. After more than a month, they achieved a great victory, beheading the bandit leader. After the matter was settled, the prefect admired his talent and wanted to offer him an official position, but he refused. He was resolute and decisive by nature, and his uprightness was sufficient to convince people. Whenever there were discussions on public welfare in the city and countryside, and opinions were divided, he would often settle the matter with a few words. The local people were originally strong and fond of litigation, but from then on, they all sought Mr. Zhao's judgment. For decades, they did not bring lawsuits to the magistrate. Between the years of Renyin and Guimao, obscene songs and plays became prevalent. Mr. Zhao abhorred them and prohibited them from entering the area. He kept watch to prevent them from entering. Some unscrupulous fellows brought in lewd actors, gathering crowds to sing and dance. Mr. Zhao returned home suddenly. The actors, in their makeup and costumes, and the audience all scattered. Mr. Zhao had a tall and imposing appearance, with a beautiful beard. He wore simple, clean clothing, and his eyes shone like lightning. Although his family was poor, he was very generous. An old woman in the neighborhood and her son relied on farming rented land for a living. In a year of famine, the landlord demanded rent urgently. The mother and son clung to each other and wept. Mr. Zhao shared grain with them. When the old woman died without the means to pay for a coffin, he provided the coffin and burial clothes. He enjoyed having guests. Regretting his lack of education, he was especially respectful to scholars. He had three sons. The eldest, Xueyong, and the youngest, Xuezhen, served as captains of the Sheng County patrol team successively. The second son was Commander Guantao. He trained and supervised them strictly, teaching them in the morning and examining their actions in the evening. He always warned them to be diligent and hardworking. He once said, "The only thing our ancestors left behind is this word 'hardship.' Hardship is our family's business. If we are content and enjoy ourselves, will we not fall into ruin?" When the Xinhai Revolution broke out, the martyr Chen Ying士 was about to lead the Northern Expedition. Guantao abandoned his studies and secretly enlisted in the army. His father and elder brother discussed pursuing him to bring him back, but Mr. Zhao refused. He laughed and said, "I am old. If I were young and strong, I would have raced ahead of my sons!" When Guantao went on the expedition to Shandong and Hebei, he said, "You went without telling me, and I do not blame you. But if you encounter hardship and return out of fear, then that is what I will greatly despise." Sheng Mountain is a mountainous area, and therefore has many bandits. Between the years of Xinhai and Renzi, the bandits became even more rampant. Mr. Zhao established a local militia and led them in defense, just as he had done in suppressing Wu Dai's bandit rebellion. As a result, the village was free from trouble. For sixteen years, he persisted without懈怠. The bandits were unable to succeed. In his later years, he loved the scenery of Mount Duxiu. The mountain sits on the upper reaches of the 剡溪 River, overlooking a vast plain, with the beauty of secluded springs and strange rocks. There are relics of Zhang Sheng, Lady Wei, and Wang Youjun. He often rode his horse among them, caressing every bridge and every stone. When he was critically ill, Xueyong was about to summon Guantao to return. Mr. Zhao angrily rebuked him, saying, "What do I expect of your younger brother? Do I want him to be reluctant to say goodbye? The founding of the Party-state and the initial pacification of Jiangnan, and the long drive to expel the north, is precisely the day of your family's destruction! Your younger brother has long cherished the ambition of revolution, but his wish has not been fulfilled. Now, taking advantage of the momentum of victory, he charges into battle. How can there not be someone like 狼瞫 to assist him? What regrets do I have?" He passed away on March 15th of the sixteenth year of the Republic, at the age of seventy-five. The villagers still praise Mr. Zhao's virtues to this day. Commander Guantao, at that time, was deeply involved in military affairs and was serving far away, enduring hardship as a soldier. Having failed to serve his parents, he suffered grief and regret. Almost five years have passed. Now that military affairs have become slightly less pressing, he plans to widely solicit writings in order to leave a model for future generations.</p>
<h3>Plum Catkins of Luofu</h3>
<p>— Fei</p>
<p>One day after Mei Lanfang arrived in Guangzhou, the Guangzhou theater community held a grand welcome meeting at the Renhe Guild Hall. Many nearby residents flocked to see Mr. Mei's elegant demeanor. The temporary gathering numbered tens of thousands of people, and the roads were blocked. Some people started disputes due to the crowds and inability to get in. Fortunately, the military police maintained order, preventing any accidents. The warm welcome the Cantonese people gave to Mei Lanfang is evident from this.</p>
<p>Since the performances began in Guangzhou, there has not been a single day without a full house. The daily income is always over eight thousand yuan. Although rumors have recently proliferated, ticket sales remain as strong as ever. It is as if the saying "Who cares about the rise and fall of the nation, the whole city is talking about 呌天儿" is being lived out.</p>
<p>Ouyang Yuqian established a drama research institute in Guangdong, which has been quite successful. Mr. Mei made a special visit. The old friends were delighted to meet again. The next day, Ouyang hosted a banquet for Mr. Mei. During the dinner, there was a detailed discussion on the reform of drama. Ouyang said that old operas have many strengths, but they must adapt to modern trends and gradually improve. Mr. Mei deeply agreed with this and recounted his experiences after visiting America. He spoke eloquently for hours. The two friends were very congenial.</p>
<p>Mr. Mei performed at the Haizhu Theater for a week and went to Hong Kong on May 6. He was scheduled to perform at the Ko Shing Theatre on the 7th and until the 11th. On the 12th, he returned to Guangzhou to continue performing for another eleven days, which will be the end of the run.</p>
<p>After Mr. Mei's performances in Guangdong, he may travel to Southeast Asia. Negotiations are currently underway. If this becomes a reality, he will definitely return to Shanghai after Guangdong before going there. This is because the completion ceremony of Mr. Du Yuesheng's family ancestral hall will be held on April 25th of the lunar calendar, and Mr. Mei has already made an appointment to perform for the celebration.</p>
<h3>Dragon Boat Race on a New Dragon Boat Festival</h3>
<p>— Rui Hongchu</p>
<p>Morley Town is densely populated, with many shops and thriving businesses. There are a total of 30 schools for boys and girls, all well-organized. The fifth day of the fifth month of the Gregorian calendar is the traditional Dragon Boat Festival. Each school traditionally takes a day off to celebrate. Two days prior, Ms. Jin Wenjun, the principal of the Xiuming Girls' School, initiated a dragon boat race as a form of exercise. Two hundred boys and girls signed up. They first took a boat to test their paddling skills, and thirty people were selected. Thirty small boats were hired. The boats' bows and sterns were decorated with paper dragons, baring their teeth and claws. Small electric light bulbs were installed in their eyes. At eight o'clock in the morning of that day, a dragon boat race was held on the canal. Prominent figures from all walks of life and principals of boys' and girls' schools were present to watch with pleasure. Ms. Jin ordered the students to board the boats, one person per boat. A small flag was inserted on each dragon's head, fluttering in the wind. Mr. Xu Mengyi, the principal of Morley School, served as the judge and issued the order to start. The paddles went down in unison, and the boats shot forward, splashing water everywhere. In the end, Shi Fangmao, a student from the Sericulture School, won the championship and was awarded a painting of an ink dragon. Applause thundered. After the race, the students disembarked and dispersed, singing the dragon boat race song.</p>
<h3>"Rejection" in Dream of the Red Chamber</h3>
<p>— Romantic Scholar</p>
<p>The book Dream of the Red Chamber has captivated countless young men and women. The merit of this book lies not only in its profound depiction of emotions but also in its vivid portrayal of events. Taking Wang Xifeng's way of handling affairs as an example, the item of "rejection" in Dream of the Red Chamber can be roughly divided into three types.</p>
<p>(1) Rejecting his return.</p>
<p>(2) Not good at rejecting his return.</p>
<p>(3) Not good at rejecting.</p>
<p>The first type is what Fengjie is accustomed to using against those maids and servants. Because these maids and servants have nothing to rely on in the Rongguo Mansion, she straightforwardly and happily "rejects" them when they do something wrong. The second type is what Fengjie uses against Bao Yu, Dai Yu, Xi Chun, Bao Chai, and others. Because although they themselves have no power, they are all deeply loved by the Old Matriarch, so whenever something happens, she often "is not good at rejecting their return." She can only use some methods to deal with them, or give them a 70% or 80% discount, using a compromise to resolve the matter. The third type is what Fengjie uses against the Old Matriarch, Madam Wang, Aunt Xue, and others. Because these are simply the direct superiors, she obeys them in everything, and "is not good at rejecting." Besides following orders carefully, what other way is there?</p>
<p>After reading the above situation, we can't help but draw a small analogy to the big. From the way things are handled in a family, we are reminded of the current government offices. Nowadays, many intermediate agencies deal with political affairs, and are probably no different from this situation. When dealing with ordinary people, they may handle things impartially, and "reject their return" for things that are not right. When dealing with people who have some reputation, then, for the sake of face, they are not good at directly rejecting their return. They can only think of a way to give them a compromise mediation. If they encounter a big shot or their own superior, then it is really "not good at rejecting." Besides obeying orders, what other way is there?</p>

<h3>Hawthorne Case Conversion (15)</h3>
<p>— Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Hawthorne suddenly raised his head and looked at me and asked, "What does his face look like?" I replied, "His face is long and his chin is slightly pointed." Hawthorne's eyes suddenly flashed. As if he had gotten some clue, he pressed on and asked, "Is there anything special about his face? Did you notice it too?" I was very proud to hear this question and replied, "This time I am confident that my vision has not been negligent. I think there are two obvious differences on that person's face: first, his eyes are somewhat angular —" At this moment, Hawthorne suddenly exclaimed, "Ha! That second different point isn't the tip of his nose a bit hooked?" If I hadn't been sitting in the car at this time, I would have jumped up. I couldn't help but clap my hands and cheered, "That's right. You saw him too?" Hawthorne did not answer and then asked, "Isn't his bow tie white with tiny blue stars?" I hesitated for a moment and replied, "Probably, but I didn't pay much attention." Hawthorne also said. "The whiteness on his face is mostly the result of snow cream. Isn't it?" I nodded again. "Exactly. Exactly." Hawthorne said. "There is also a strong fragrance nearby." I hurriedly replied, "Yes, yes. That can't be wrong——" Hawthorne then hurriedly interrupted and said, "His hair that has been smeared with Stancome is combed flat back——Oh. I was wrong. You can't see this." I couldn't help but raise my right palm. Pat him on the shoulder. I shouted, "Enough. Enough. There will never be any mistakes again. Do you know this person?" Our conversation was at a tense moment. My body shook. The car had already stopped. I poked my head out and took a look. This is already Lin Yin Road. The car is parked in front of my residence. I got out of the car. Then I invited Hawthorne to sit in my residence for a while. I was still enthusiastically inviting guests at this time. I can't deny that all I wanted to do was to end my question. Hawthorne suddenly declined. "I'm sorry. I can't obey. I should have gone in to ask about your wife's illness. But it's late at night. I'll come to ask tomorrow." So before I parted with him. I had to re-propose my last question. Hawthorne shook his head and said, "I don't know him. But when I was in the Gao family. My eyes were not as focused as yours. I have indeed seen him. But it's not of much use in reality. What I mean. If we want to investigate the whereabouts of this person. We might as well start with your aunt-in-law. You can only take on this move. If there is any clue. Let's discuss the second step of the implementation method."</p>

<h3>Financial Gold Market Mediocre and Unremarkable</h3>
<p>Private Exchanges Post More Premiums. Yesterday, the gold price on the 15th rose and then fell again, with a relatively flat trend. From morning to night, there was a difference of only five taels. In the end, it rose slightly by a few cents. The intentions of each company varied, leading to differences in supply and demand. This was probably because the overseas silver market was flat in England and down in the US. Therefore, the market opened high early in the morning. Afterward, it rose and fell slightly by one or two taels, while the foreign exchange was clearly listed as unchanged but secretly tightened slightly. Later in the market, firmness turned into weakness, and finally fell to over 742 taels. Later, due to the quick selling of positions, and because the market had already privately opened exchanges, the price rose from small to large, initially by one tael, and still with many premiums. However, there were few transactions at this price, and later because the short sellers were unwilling to exchange lightly, it was increased to around two taels. All the companies involved in mutual exchanges, such as Zhifengyong, Yongfeng, Qianchangxiang, Hengyu, Daxingyong, and the Dalian Gang, etc., still have a large portion to be officially exchanged today (the 16th). The long positions include Daxingyong, Chengfengyong, Zhenchangxiang, Qianchangxiangsheng, Taihengxing, etc., while the short positions include Yongfeng, Zhifengyong, Yuanheng, Fuchang, Xinheng, Yonghengshunli, Wanxing, Yingfengheng, etc. Yuanmaoyong, Dadecheng, and others have both long and short positions due to different clients. The recent spot trend is not sensitive, probably because there will not be much collection in June. Observing the situation, the market is unlikely to be optimistic and there will be a period of consolidation. The market opened high and then hovered. The June market opened four taels higher yesterday morning, at 745 taels and 8 mace. Although large bars had no impact, the silver price fell by a quarter. Private telegrams were the same, and European buyers were unsatisfied. Later, from 5 taels and 5 mace to 6 taels and 5 mace, Zhifengyong and Qianchangxiang and others bought in, and then Wanxingshunli, Dadecheng and others sold, falling one tael, for 5 taels and 1 mace, and then 7 or 8 cents were added, and Yuanchengyong Huiyuan and others bought in, but the exchange rate was stable, and the bank offered prices from 25 to 3121.

The highest price of the whole day was 47 taels and 6 mace, and the lowest price was 42 taels and 2 mace, with a height of 5 taels and 4 mace.

<p>Yarn and Cloth: Yarn Market Mediocre</p>
<p>The yarn market is calm, and the trend is still weak. There are many rumors about the current situation, and the overseas cotton market is sluggish. Furthermore, there are rumors that a large amount of 10-count coarse yarn is being delivered, and it is expected that the buyer will be unable to take delivery of a large batch. Therefore, this month's market fluctuates up and down, and most people have a consistent bearish outlook, selling as soon as the market price is slightly higher. However, from a fundamental point of view, because raw material prices are firm, manufacturers are already in pain, and the standard price is lower than the current yarn price. Except for 10-count coarse yarn, there is no goods to deliver, because the price is higher than 45 taels, so a certain merchant's intention to take delivery is still firm. However, American cotton is still weak, and current yarn sales are still good. Shenxin Factory sold 1,000 bales of 16-count "Ren Zhong" yarn at a price of 172 taels, to be delivered in Qingdao. If there are no changes in the current situation, the market is expected to rise.</p>
<p>This Month's "Ren Biao" Yarn is Unusually Firm: The "Ren Biao" yarn market opened with a soft outlook due to rumors about the current situation and the fall in American cotton. Prices fell by 3, 4, or 7 qian, but this month's yarn rose by 2 qian. In the afternoon, as there were few sellers of "Biao" yarn, prices rose by 2, 3, 4, or 5 qian for each month. The total transaction volume for the day was 20,350 bales. It was found that 1,150 bales of Tianlong yarn were sold, 2,000 bales of Gengfeng yarn, 550 bales of Yichang yarn, 750 bales of Shenxin yarn, 1,050 bales of Xianjinyuda yarn, 500 bales of Gongtai yarn, 1,000 bales of Tianlong yarn, 750 bales of Rongxing yarn, 1,050 bales of Changfeng yarn, and 550 bales of Yukang yarn. The closing prices are recorded on the left.</p>
<p>| "Ren Biao" Closing Prices | Rise/Fall | Open Interest |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| May 160.6 | Up 0.536 | 700,800 |</p>
<p>| June 160.3 | Down 0.468 | 450,000 |</p>
<p>| July 160.0 | 0.376 | 350,000 |</p>
<p>| August 160.0 | Down 0.282 | 350,000 |</p>
<p>| September 156.3 | 344,000 | 500,000 |</p>
<p>| October 156.5 | 131,000 | 800,000 |</p>
<p>Current Yarn Demand is Not Weak: Current yarn sales are still good. It was found that various merchant groups bought a total of 1,300 bales throughout the day, with 600 bales being traded among colleagues. The market was mediocre. Merchant groups from the interior took 270 bales, Sichuan took 125 bales, Changsha took 100 bales, Hankou group took 210 bales, Yunnan took 40 bales, Gaoyang took 40 bales, Xiamen took 60 bales, and miscellaneous groups took 200 bales.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market: Sellers Scarce in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>The cotton market is weak due to the continuous fall in American cotton, and the market sentiment is quite poor. Therefore, retail investors are selling off consistently, and the public's sentiment has changed. However, it is difficult for prices to fall significantly due to the weak bottom cargo. Japanese merchants are still not letting go. Judging from the situation of foreign cotton, there should be a possibility of a drop. However, with the exchange rate being firm, the combined price of foreign cotton is still difficult to import. Therefore, the buyer's attitude is still firm.</p>
<p>"Han Biao" Rises by 1 Qian: The "Han Biao" market opened with a fall of 5 fen to 1 qian following American cotton. In the afternoon, the market sentiment tightened again due to a lack of sellers. Prices rose by 5 fen to 2 qian. The transaction volume was 31,000 dan. It was found that 4,000 dan of Jifeng yarn were sold, 1,800 dan of Shenchang yarn, 1,600 dan of Xincheng yarn, and 1,400 dan of Yuanda yarn. 2,000 dan of Changfeng yarn were bought, 1,100 dan of Deji yarn, 1,100 dan of Jinfeng yarn, and 1,000 dan of Yicheng yarn. The closing prices are recorded on the left.</p>
<p>| "Han Biao" Closing Prices | Rise/Fall | Open Interest |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| July 386.0 | Up 1.018 | 370,000 |</p>
<p>| May 391.5 | Up 1.593 | 308,000 |</p>
<p>| August 384.5 | 105,000 | 370,000 |</p>
<p>| June 388.0 | 1.014 | 390,000 |</p>
<p>| October 367.5 | 1.040 | 000,000 |</p>
<p>Cotton Spot Market Quiet: Spot cotton transactions are quiet. The source is estimated to be 800 bales of Yao cotton and 100 pieces of wooden frame cotton.</p>
<h3>Foreign Yarn and Cotton: The Downturn Intensifies</h3>
<p>American Cotton Continues to Fall: Yesterday, American cotton fell initially due to unfavorable news from Liverpool. Later, due to favorable weather and a sluggish Wall Street, the market situation became even weaker. Futures fell by 10 to 15 points in pounds, and spot fell by 15 points in pounds. British cotton futures fell by 3 points, and spot fell by 6 points. Egyptian cotton spot fell by 5 points. The Indian cotton market was sluggish, with Pingguo Er unchanged, Aomula down 2 rupees, and Bailuo Creek down 3 rupees. The original telegram records are on the left (dated 14th):</p>

<p>Grain: Foreign Rice Sees New Telegraphic Transactions</p>
<p>Domestic Xiang and Dumai Rice Steps Up Briskly</p>
<p>Yesterday, domestic Xiang rice was 2 or 3 jiao higher due to Dumai rice rising. The local street's handling became even healthier, people are hoping for the best, and transaction volume was not weak. It is estimated that the Tongshi market opened with 1,000 bags of Jiangxi machine-milled late rice, priced at 11 yuan 4 jiao, 11 yuan, and 10 yuan 07 jiao and a half. Also, there were 300 bags of machine-milled early rice, priced at 10 yuan 06 jiao. The Beiyang group also handled 90 bags of Jiangxi machine-milled Yuanyuan rice, priced at 14 yuan 3 jiao. The market situation is still brisk, and the prices are 5 or 6 fen better than the previous market. Furthermore, because the price of Dumai rice is gradually rising, the local street will definitely have a strong appetite, and with thin inventory and continuous sources, the future market is still promising.</p>
<p>After Mitsui opened two batches of foreign rice, local customers in the market are eager to try. Yesterday, traders and local street retailers contacted foreign merchants again to continue, and there were already two batches of telegrams sent. Mitsui &amp; Co. had 1,000 tons, priced at 5 taels 2 qian and a half, and Bader &amp; Co.'s No. 1 Saigon rice was priced at 5 taels 3 qian and a half. It is expected that whether or not the transactions can be successfully completed will be confirmed today or tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Flour: Downtrend Quite Fierce</h3>
<p>Clear Weather: Many are Eager to Sell</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market unanimously fell back. The quoted prices of foreign flour have fallen back by 2, 3, or 4 jiao. The unexpected weather turned sunny again, causing the internal and external sentiment to shift, and many speculators eagerly sold, so near and far terms have fallen sharply. In the afternoon, because the Beiyang group slightly increased its intake, the market became stable. Looking at the future situation, with the route for foreign flour unbroken, even if prices rise sharply, they will inevitably fall back in the end. Because yesterday, there were also rumors that foreign flour was priced at 2 yuan 5 jiao and a half, and is currently being inquired about by telegram. As a result, this month's flour fell by 1 fen and a half compared to the previous day, June and July fell by 2 fen and 2.5 li, August fell by 1 fen and 7 li, September fell by 2 fen and 2.5 li, and October fell by 2 fen.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Step Down</h3>
<p>Yesterday, wheat futures showed a tired state. The previous day's crazy rise had little meaning in fact, but only took advantage of the weather to raise prices excessively. Yesterday, the weather turned dark again, and foreign wheat also reported small numbers, so the opening prices of each contract stepped down. It is rumored that foreign wheat is priced at around 18 yuan 5 jiao and is currently being inquired about by telegram. If this becomes a reality, it will surely change the landscape. As a result, this month's wheat fell by 1 fen compared to the previous day, June fell by 4 fen, July fell by 3 fen, and August and September fell by 5 fen, and October fell by 4 fen.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea: The Current Situation of Changxing Spring Silkworms is Terrible</p>
<p>Purely Damaged by Cold Rain</p>
<p>This year's spring silkworm feeding amount in Changxing's various markets and villages is still not weak, but the early silkworms suffered from cold weather and reduced egg hatching. The climate was unusually cold after the late silkworms started to sleep, coupled with little sunshine and much rain. The silkworms' development was unfavorable. The early silkworms are now opening leaves after the first sleep. Due to continuous heavy rain, many silkworms are suffering from white muscardine disease. The late silkworms are also in their third sleep and have started consuming leaves. Due to eating wet leaves, yellowing has been observed. The current situation is terrible.</p>
<h3>European and American Factory Jing Silk: Telegraphic Transfer Prices Still Small</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai foreign trading house yarn market still tended to be peaceful. It was found that the overseas market's daily silk opening prices were increasingly lower, and the telegraphic transfer prices for Shanghai white factory Jing silk were increasingly smaller. Chinese merchants found it difficult to sell their heavy loads. Yesterday, only Weicheng and others took 20 bales of Shanghai white factory Jing silk, and Xinfu took 40 bales of Baiqian Jing silk. The prices remained stable.</p>
<h3>The Stunning Debut of Qihong's New Crop</h3>
<p>The Qimen new black tea, which has attracted attention from both Chinese and foreigners, arrived yesterday by the Yangtze River with more than 2,900 boxes. Including the previous batches, there are more than 3,000 boxes on the market. Due to the excellent aroma of the tea leaves, it has attracted great attention from the British. The market atmosphere is unusually tense. Initially, Baochang &amp; Co. opened with 280 taels for the top lot. Jardine, Concord, Jinlong, and other firms expressed their eagerness and rushed to bid. Depending on the quality of the goods, the bidding continued to reach beyond 300 taels. Finally, the Liulv brand sold by Yuanfengrun Tea House opened at the top price of 360 taels. This high price is unprecedented in history. This year, the Qimen estates focused on harvesting green leaves early, resulting in excellent products and developed European sales, which fully demonstrates that China's tea foreign trade urgently needs fundamental improvement as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Province's Tea Season</h3>
<p>Wuning black tea has always been famous. In recent years, due to foreign merchants suppressing prices, most tea businesses have suffered losses and have been unable to pay high prices for purchases. Mountain households have also reduced planting due to low prices, leading to a sharp decline in the natural quality product. This year, the Tea Industry Association paid attention to improvements, widely issued declarations, and persuaded mountain households to open gardens early and process and manufacture. Tea shops also offered high prices and limited the harvest to before Grain Rain and the end of weighing to before the Beginning of Summer. Now, all the goods from each estate have been collected, with estimated costs averaging 60 to 70 taels, more than double the previous year. However, the gardens opened earlier this year, and the goods are extremely tender. The weather is sunny and the aroma is especially good. In the future, when transported to Shanghai, high prices are expected. This year's turnaround is truly due to the efforts of the Tea Industry Association's promotion.</p>
<h3>More Than Ten New Local Tea Factories Added</h3>
<p>Due to sluggish business in recent years, the number of local tea factories in Shanghai has decreased from more than 80 to more than 30. When the new tea came on the market this year, most tea factories adopted a wait-and-see attitude, and purchases were sparse. However, since the opening of the new tea market, tea merchants have seized the opportunity to reorganize and sent personnel to the mountains to purchase. According to recent surveys, there are already 46 tea factories in Shanghai, an increase of more than ten from before.</p>
<h3>Tunxi Tea Firms are Launching Scales</h3>
<p>The early new tea from Xiuyi County has already been harvested and the gardens are closed. The famous high-grade estate teas will also be half-harvested. The tea firms in Tunxi's Liyang and Shuikou areas have seen the Shanghai market's stock of Zhenmei tea being low, and the sales of Xiumei, Zhenmei, and lower-grade teas to France becoming smooth, so their interest has greatly increased. Recently, many tea firms have launched scales, specializing in searching for the leading teas before the Beginning of Summer in the northeast of Wu and the southeast of Xiuyi, hoping to obtain more genuine goods and increase sales prices. The Tunpu money shops have transported large amounts of silver from Shanghai and Hangzhou to meet the needs of the tea firms due to the new tea coming on the market and the urgent need for funds. Recently, Shanghai notes have been selling for 1,380 yuan to 1,376 yuan per thousand, and the money supply has become active, with the tea market showing signs of gradually becoming lively.</p>
<h3>Wuyi Tea Affected by Heavy Rain</h3>
<p>Since the opening of the gardens for the new tea in Wuyi County, the weather has been overcast and rainy. Recently, there have been heavy downpours and mountain floods. The tea-picking men and women have been working hard in the mud and water every day. The tea leaves are soaked in rain, stiff and not soft, and grow very quickly, easily becoming old and grassy. In the beginning, many households with more tea reduced the number of workers hired to save money, as they thought the mountain prices would be difficult to increase this year. Unexpectedly, the weather was unfavorable, and they were all struggling to harvest and process in time. Today, all families are adding extra female tea workers, braving the rain to pick and intensify the roasting, as the tea is growing rapidly and cannot be delayed. According to this, the cost of picking workers and firewood is more than double the old cost. The cost for small households has increased compared to last year, and the tea production is again suffering losses. Therefore, under the tea trees in the tea gardens, one can hear the complaints and sighs of these people everywhere.</p>
<p>Sugar Market: Raw Brown Sugar Opens with More Than 4,000 Bags</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market received telegrams from the producing areas: Cuban current sugar prices remained unchanged, New York sugar futures for May remained unchanged, and the other months fell back by 1 point each. Java current and futures sugar also had no fluctuations. The market's negotiated transactions were quite active. Dutch No. 24 coarse sand white sugar rose to 10 taels 05 qian and a half, and high-quality goods rose to 10 taels 07 qian, with more than 1,000 bags being transacted. This was an increase of 5 fen compared to the previous day, and the market sentiment was strong. No. 20 medium sand sugar was priced at 10 taels 01 qian and a half, with little demand. The daily market was active, and the market price gradually trended upwards. N Mark was priced at 10 taels 06 qian and 2.5 fen to 6 qian and a half, TK Mark was priced at 10 taels 06 qian, and later shouted for 10 taels 07 qian, TX Mark was priced at 10 taels 09 qian, YP Mark was priced at 10 taels 09 qian and a half, TM Mark was priced at 10 taels 03 qian, J Mark was priced at 11 taels to 11 taels 05 fen, YT Mark was priced at 10 taels 05 qian and a half, YRO Mark was priced at 9 taels 9 qian 7.5 fen, and Minghua goods were priced at 10 taels. The market was generally brisk and showed signs of further increase. For the sale of spot goods for May and June, Wanqing Bingchang &amp; Co. sold 200 tons at a silver price of 8 taels 1 qian. Huaxin &amp; Co. opened with more than 1,000 bags of spot medium sand white sugar, priced at 10 taels 01 qian. More than 4,000 bags of raw brown sugar were priced at 9 taels 2 qian, which was an increase of 1 qian compared to the previous market. The factory's Binghua Qing sugar, for delivery in three weeks, opened at 9 taels 4 qian and a half. Guohuo Huanggang Qing sugar opened with 400 bags, priced at 7 taels 8 qian and a half to 7 taels 9 qian, and high-quality goods were shouted for 8 taels 2 qian, but there were few buyers at the moment. Wufu Bing sugar opened with 180 boxes, priced at 8 taels 5 qian, a decrease of 2 qian compared to the previous market. The market shape was generally firm and brisk.</p>
<p>Hardware: New Black Iron Nails Arrive</p>
<p>Because there are not many black iron nails on the market, they are also a popular item on the market recently. Various groups, such as those from Tianjin, Yantai, Qingdao, Yingkou, and Andong, are all purchasing them. As a result, the market supply is becoming increasingly scarce, and the standard price has risen by several qian. Currently, a double box of 3-point nails sells for 61 taels 5 qian, a single box sells for 31 taels 4 fen, a double box of 60 taels, and a single box of 30 taels 07 qian and a half. A double box of 5-point nails sells for 59 taels 5 qian, a single box of 30 taels, and a double box of 6-point nails sells for 58 taels, a single box of 30 taels. It is heard that groups from Sichuan, Nanjing, and Wuhu are also sending telegrams to purchase them, but lament that there are no goods to buy. It is heard that new goods, such as 400 to 500 boxes shipped by Xintai Ancient Store yesterday, will surely create a lively scene in the market.</p>
<p>Piece Goods: White Background Colored Tings are Selling Very Well</p>
<p>Yesterday, the piece goods trade was very active due to the warm weather, so summer goods were unusually active. Among them, the white background printed colored Tings were selling the best. Local and domestic merchants were strongly purchasing them, priced from 2 qian 05 li to 2 qian 2 fen and a half. More than 200 pieces were transacted yesterday. Striped Fu silk has already become scarce. The Huxinting Qingguan Mirror is quickly selling out. Arrow Lai Tu is selling for 4 qian 05 li. Yuansubu is still difficult to improve due to the large amount of spot goods. Li Taibai is priced at 14 taels 1 qian, Little Beauty at 12 taels 05 fen, Dian Qiuxiang at 10 taels 03 qian, and Hanshan Temple Double Children Deer at 10 taels 01 qian and a half. White trend cloth is also showing signs of life, but the upper-body goods are quite popular, probably because there are few arrivals. Black goods are not selling as well as before due to the unfavorable season. There was no significant change in Zhigongni yesterday. Although there is a market for fine Biji, the number is also small. Blue striped colored Tings have slightly fallen due to the impact of abundant arrivals. Jun Nong Tu and Yang Guifei have all fallen to 2 qian 2 fen and a half, Kewai Chunfeng to 2 qian 6 fen and 7 li and a half, and Putuoshan to 2 qian 7 fen and 2 li and a half. There is a shortage of spot goods for printed Zhigongni and medium-grade Zhigongduan.</p>
