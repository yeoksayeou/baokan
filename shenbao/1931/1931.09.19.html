<p>時評</p>
<h3>防水當先治標</h3>
<p>前清政治不修。官吏泄沓成風。百廢不舉。舉而獨於有關數省民命之黃運各河大工程。尚知注意。特派大員以督理其事。對於歲修工程。不敢稍有疏忽。無論如何困難。至遲必須於霉汛前趕竣。蓋一至霉汛。風潮隨時可至。苟不竣工。一遇大風潮襲擊。勢必前功盡棄。遺禍實大。如此次金山嘴海塘。修工未竣、突遇風災。即將所有設施過半之新工程。盡捲入海洋以去。此即其明證。故前清時負治水工程之責者。决不敢稍加玩忽。苟其有之。必受最嚴重之處分。至於出險搶修。更不容有片刻之偷懈。因其數千萬垂危之民命。一髮千鈞懸之於負責人員之手。絕不能如其他工事之稍可耽延也。今者潮汛將過。搶修工畢之後。正宜派員將河海各隄防塘壩。詳細逐一勘察。備於霜降以後。大加修理。蓋經此大風潮衝擊以後。即幸未出險之處。隄身亦亦必衝動受損。目前苟不預爲修理。則來年潮汎一至。又將皇急無措。危險實不堪設。想果欲全盤修理。則今日正當計劃準備之時。倘若仍如從前之悠忽。日日空言而不舉。則此半年中可以動工之時。轉瞬即過。縱欲修理而不及矣。然今日返觀國内現狀不。能令人無憂即以運河論。江北潰决各口。所謂搶修工程。進行尚甚困難。或因未涸出而不能施工。或因料缺財乏而不能着手。臨時工程。猶且日延一日。而不能迅速告竣。則欲進一步而爲防患未來之計。大舉修理。以爲恢復歲修之先聲。不更戞戞乎其難之乎。諺云。「賊出關門。」中國人向來之防患政策。無不如此。今大水之突然侵入。爲賊於我民者至鉅且酷。若不將防水之門。急速修理。則他日大水又至。又將何法以禦之乎。</p>
<p>上述之修理工程。不過治標之策耳。然在今日。實以治標爲最急要。我國革命而後。揭櫫以革命之精神。努力於建設。竊願目前暫置其他建設。而努力於水利上之建設。尤願移其革命之精神。以努力於水利上治標之建設。</p>

<h3>蘇省營業稅開徵期問題</h3>
<p>▲官方主張夏季起算</p>
<p>▲商界要求秋季啓徵</p>
<p>無錫通信、民國二十年一月一日、爲裁釐之期、四月一日爲開始徵收營業稅之日、蘇省各縣商會、當時因稅率發生疑義、請求省方解釋、並作進一步之要求、請予豁免或展緩、相持甚久、最後對於稅率之輕重、亦有一度之請求、商界方面曾得到少許之勝利、在四月間、蘇省各縣營業稅局先後成立、將申報書發交商會、轉發各業同業公會塡報、其未入商會之各業、由局直接派員調查、或託公安分局就近調查、至五月間、多數已調查竣事、即塡發營業調查登記證、在七月間、即開始徵收稅銀、入商會者交由商會彙解、不入商會之各業、由局派員直接收取、惟各縣營業稅啓徵時期、現又發生問題、在省方係四月一日開徵、稅銀當然作爲夏季、但在商界方面、則謂調查塡報竣事、已過六月、從七月起、當然要作爲秋季啓徵、官商相持、未有解决、而各縣營業稅局爲省方催欵急迫、急於解欵起見、特變通辦法、於第一次收取稅銀時、其收條上並未書明某季稅欵、作爲將來伸縮之地步、最近各地營業稅局接奉省廳訓令、飭將夏季營業稅結束、預備徵收秋季稅銀、各營業稅局奉令後、當即轉函商會查照、錫邑商會自接王仲清局長公函後、以此事關係重要、特函營業稅局、陳述商業凋敝情形、請即轉呈省廳、准從秋季啓徵、王局長接函後、當即轉呈省廳請示、一面由錫商會代電鎭江商會、請聯合各縣商會、一致向省廳請求、准從秋季徵起、此電去後、尚未得省廳之答復、此事究達目的與否、現尚未能逆料也、</p>

<h3>第三國際與蘇俄之陰謀（九續）</h3>
<p>阿斯德　吾等對於罷工之爆發、前此已屢爲提及、特别是關於絲廠方面、即君亦早有是項推測、何以結果竟如此其壞、吾人一再叮嚀各同志作相當之準備、且囑黨部設法、與絲廠取聯絡、然而罷工一過、事實上已證明吾等較之今年一月、實無絲毫之進步、</p>
<p>哥魯平　在組織方面言、吾等亦間有成功、特不過不在絲廠中耳、最近某英國電氣公司内、吾人已新成立一小組、惟僅有同志二人、在某汽船公司内、亦有同志二人、吾人已派同志二十人赴各工廠内工作、以與右派搗亂份子一搏、蓋彼等曾語一般工人曰、「汝切勿聽信中央委員會派來作職工運動者之言、彼等囑汝罷工、囑汝發生組織、但一遇危險、則彼等已溜之大吉、而汝則身繫囹圄、甚或召殺身之禍矣」、此種論調、對於少數工人當然有甚大之影響、故吾人必須派遣同志赴廠中、與彼等共同工作、惟一般同志又頗不耐在工廠工作之苦、故只好將應受懲戒之同志担任之、至於今日、一般的意見、皆以爲派赴工廠作工本身即係一種懲罰、以是每派一同志、彼必數數追問究犯何罪、</p>
<p>德律風工人中、吾人已成功三個紅色職工會的團體、人數亦有二十人之多、在汽船公司中負責之同志、則已將工人七十人組織成十個之職工團體、吾人在公共租界電車工人中所做之工作、亦頗有成績、吾人進行之步驟、係第一步與彼等接交、然後秘密約集各部份之代表談話、數日内耿福泰同志即可出獄、有若干工人已組織一會、爲彼除霉、并醵集欵項、以供彼家庭之費用、同</p>

<h3>接要聞</h3>
<p>時并要求廠方恢復彼之工作、并决定於彼出　之日罷工一天、以資示感、足證吾等在彼輩中之勢力尚屬不小、</p>
<p>阿斯德　似此則尚差强人意、但此種計劃、是否係全體工人的自動、抑或僅限於吾等所有之小組、</p>
<p>哥魯平　此種計劃、實係工人自動的主張、吾人已决定將此種運動加以擴大、并將此次之歡迎會改組爲五一委員會、吾人現正爲彼等預備作一度增加工資的鬭爭、蓋不久電車公司即將增另票價出、過去電車公司每增加票價一次、工人之工資亦必增加一次、彼等最近一次增加工資之事、係起於今年元旦爲免除工人頻繁的索加工資起見、吾人已决提出下列之要求、（一）代工人付給房金、（二）免費乘坐上海各路電車、（三）每季須爲工人特製衣服（四）反對罰金、（五）作工滿一年、應多給一月工資、滿二年應多給二月、餘類推、以上數項要求、實與此次公司方面增加票價針鋒相對、蓋增加票價、工人當然首蒙影響也、一面吾人更將聯絡貧苦社會、以及反帝國主義同盟、竭力反對增加票價、并將彼等組成一合法之團體、</p>
<p>阿斯德　君等以後當仍時刻注意中國各地之蘇維埃區、勿因上海之工潮緊張、遂置之腦後、前日意沙麥諾告予、君等對上海工人所發之傳單、竟毫未提及中國各地蘇維埃之事、至爲遺恨、君等前此謂有一千人動員、參加紅軍活動、何近日又無所聞、</p>
<p>哥及向　近日各工廠參加紅軍活動之代表、尚無一人、因此種辦法、原係個人應募性質、且開始時又未行之甚善、少數不忠實之工人確曾應募、但彼等於領得旅費之後、即不願再往蘇維埃區、甚有自此避不見面者、</p>
<p>阿斯德　君等必須切實調查、此輩狡賴之工人、究屬何廠、以及何人介紹、加以相當之處分、參加紅軍活動工作、何等重大、乃竟受一般工人之欺騙耶、以後對於負責同志亦應澈底考查、且應從新訂定計劃、要知此種工作、勢在必行、而紅軍及蘇維埃區之命脈、亦全係於黨的方面能否與以切實之援助也、且經過今回之試騐、以後吾人觀於參加之踴躍與否、即可以得到上海各項組織之眞確的評價也、</p>
<p>君等近來與巴布諾瓦及克盧有無具體之計劃、彼等在此二三月中、竟未授以工作、寗不可惜、彼等最近即將往蘇維埃區、但在未出發以前、應與以相當工作、且必使其隨時可以動身、</p>
<p>關於五一節之準備、亦希望君等能有簡短之報告、予曾與斯拉温及意沙麥諾討論此問題、并已有詳盡之規劃、君等將來進行、甚盼隨時報告、</p>
<p>（五十）先鋒隊記甘納地轉呈之報告摘要、紅色職工各小組情形、在東區吾人已有五個紅色小組、其中三個、係本星期所組織、紗廠方面、爲新愼（譯音）紗廠·上海第一紗廠·厚生紗廠·由新紗廠·以及申新同名之一紗廠、三星）等、皆有份子散佈於其間、五個小組之人數共約二十、彼等能分頭散發傳單、此五小組、近已共組一區委員會、每組選派代表一人、船塢工人中、吾人亦有七個小組、每組約十人、英界電車工人中、有三個小組、每組亦有十人、吾人近更成立一工廠委員會、該會委員五人、皆係工人所選、此會產生之目的、在於設法援救去年被捕之某一工人、（吾人之同志）彼等已將請求釋放之要求提出、並已集欵五百元、以資應用、此外工人間若有糾紛、亦常就此會解决、各小鐵工塲内、亦有十八人、組成幾個小組、其中一人、係在公共租界工部局所有之鐵塲内工作、</p>
<p>附屬組織之最近情形、目前吾人共有十八人、其中一人在西區某茶號内作工、二人係在該區作小販、五人在兵工廠及法租界電車公司附近作小販東區有宿舍一間、閘北有小販一、學校二、其中一校、約有工人三十、</p>
<p>（五八）關於全國組織之工作報告之决議一九三一年五月一日、中央委員會接受、（一）中央自接到組織部關於全國組織之報告以後、深知四次大會對於轉變後之實際工作、應立一强有力之基礎、但此時之轉變、乃工作之開端、亦殊無重要之表現、足令人滿意、如爭領導權之方法、以及多數黨部之工作、仍呈現過去之遺憾、且轉變後之速度亦覺太慢、關於黨務之發展、及工業區中央小組之成立、亦殊乏可觀之成效、幹部問題、其不滿人意之處、亦如從前、至關於吸收新幹部、尤其是於勞工幹部、亦無若何之結果、黨之組織情勢、及蘇维埃區域之羣衆、仍乏定向、至於蘇維埃區域鄰境及白色省之農業中心區域、等地之組織、亦殊無顯著實力之表現、自組織之觀點言之、吾人尚未能證實使農工能自動的立於領導者之地位、重要之紀念日、吾人并無良善之組織、甚至於無充分之預備、五月之各種紀念日、吾人竟不能自然地成立一五月委員會、更爲吾等無力之玫現、黨與羣衆團體的關係、仍不免常常發生錯誤、不是黨忽略羣衆的工作、就是黨包辦羣衆工作、辦理工會的行動、常有無政府主義之傾向、黨與靑年團之關係、在各方均顯出種種對立之傾向、近來多數組織、被敵人破獲、同時中央深信許多黨的機關尤以領導機關爲甚、尚不明瞭秘密黨之眞正任務、及轉變後工作之切實内容、甚至有少數黨部、且不能執行四次大會之減縮上級機關及深入羣衆的决議、</p>
<p>以上所述、均屬「嚴重不易救藥」之病微、亟應從速改正、使實際工作的轉變痛快的實現、</p>

<p>第三役　東南對兩江　一八比三七　兩江勝</p>
<p>總結　兩江勝二次　東南勝一次　曁南全負</p>
<h3>丨大戰眞相丨</h3>
<p>市虎杯蛇　銀笛聲中、戰幕徐揭、兩江中鋒龍競雄高出人頭、一拍即得、由邵錦英楊而仁、再歸龍氏之中、投而不中、再投又不利、楊繼之、仍未如願、球轉風向、東南　亦德失之交臂、兩江王蘭犯規、潘月英當塲錯過、二分鐘光陰、如是過去、一轉旋間、楊仁輕騎叩關、邵錦匹馬奪壘、笛聲兩起、連告命中、東南宣稱停戰、商劃戰略、冀挽狂瀾、一球飛來、潘月英順水推舟、打入籃中、甚爲美觀、東南遂開紀錄得二分、兩江陣綫驟變、前鋒出沒無常、内衛點水不入、東南戰士失色、驚措不安、市虎杯蛇、草木皆兵、把守失策、球籃屢害、第一節比數二十六比三、東南落後、</p>
<p>精神激昂　東南經此劇創、勝利難望、戰將精神、反現激昂、其初内衛處位過前、每授敵方侵入之機、茲乃轉立其後、緊緊相隨、此計見效、前鋒亦昂然而起、作對抗之勢、顧兩江久戰之師、攻守超人一等、任汝金城鐵壁、先下强手者、仍爲兩江邵錦英楊仁二人、東南竇文德計從心來、兩次暗渡陳倉、咸告凱旋、能自强敵手中、接連中的、竇氏亦可自慰矣、繼而又見邵錦英自天羅地網中、打入一球、潘月莫連中兩次罰球、停戰笛聲之前、邵氏再顯身手、又加二分、是節也、雙方緊凑異常、兩江多勝二分、良覺艱難、比數八比六、上半時兩江二十六分、東南九分、</p>
<p>工力適敵　東南表演、逐漸佳妙、迨至第三節、外有潘月英領導、内有蔣懷萱把舵、左右輔佐、莫不奮起、兩江空懷天大本領、亦難縱橫如意若第一節者、東南潘月英一投中的、銳氣突增、後此局面、全見雙方守衛之工夫、左搶右奪、前阻後欄、你來我往、各有巧妙、雙方成績、兩江邵錦英罰中一分、龍竸雄三分、東南潘月英再加一分、是節結果四比三、兩江勝一分、</p>
<p>雖敗猶榮　普通球隊一旦失風、即呈瓦解之象、成不可收拾之勢、女子尤易犯斯病、惟彼東南、獨矯斯弊、第二第二兩節、分庭相抗、博得觀衆同情、第四節最後發奮、愈見精神、實際上論、東南人才尚不及兩江、然而能繼兩江之後、有起而代之雄心者、惟東南耳、東南昨日之之敗、理勢所必然、相差過鉅、咎在第一節之慌忙失措耳、末節中、兩江頻下敵壘、勢不可當、東南發奮有爲、最後加鞭、分數緊張、不下上述兩節、第四節七比六、兩江僅多一分、下半時兩江十一、東南九分、總結果三十七比十八、兩江勝、</p>

<p>棒球第二幕江灣戰勝立意</p>
<h3>丨六比二丨</h3>
<p>昨日爲棒球三角循環之第二幕比賽、與賽者爲江灣（復旦）對立意、酣戰七局、江灣以人才平均而得勝、立意技術優劣不均、而失敗、查前日立意戰勝約翰、而昨日敗於江灣、今日江灣如能再戰勝約翰、則得本屆之棒球錦標、以兩日之比賽情形而論、江灣似可操必勝、但事往往有出人意料之外者、如海星排球之敗於務本、孫成璧汪民視網球雙打之戰勝錢耀彬屠開元等、皆出多數人之預料、記者無知、不敢作確定之判斷、欲知如何且待今日打過明白、</p>
<p>頭兩局一無所得　第一局開賽立意先行攻打、在繫球之五人中、張兆李文煊各得一次安打、魏宗鏜并得四球進駐一壘、但李子機黃啟樞均由一壘出局、魏堂鏜亦以奔跑太遲、致死於第二壘、以此立意於第一局一無所得、江灣進攻、馮兆元金鎭東接連出局、曾邦廣雅賴敵隊遊擊之錯誤、進占一壘、惟在安樂生得安打時、冒險衝鋒、致於第三壘出局、亦屬兩手空空、第二局再戰、益發爽快、立意四人動手、三人繼續於片刻間出局、江灣亦復如是、</p>
<p>得安打江灣發威風　三局開始、立意忽現不景氣、處處是逆境、至江灣進攻時、顧得剛雖爲江灣隊柱石、但未至第一壘、裁判員已令其出局、任傑星於馮兆元擊球時、以偷壘亦取消資格、在大衆以爲無望時、孰料柳暗花明、忽造成新局面、馮兆元、金鎭東先後均以敵人之錯誤、得進佔一二壘、曾廣邦又以得安打聞、於是、馮兆元先行跑回本壘、打開紀錄、繼馮跑者爲金振東、至梁耀華打球時、三壘俱有人在、斯時之空氣緊張爲昨日比賽最興奮之一幕、惜梁君擊　太高、爲敵一壘員由空中截止、結束第三局、</p>
<p>三打數樂生顯神通　第四局再戰、江灣投手安樂生、大顯神通、使李煊於第一壘出局後、於黃啟樞陳光榮攻打時、連得兩「三打數」獲女籃球錦標之兩江隊（本館攝）</p>
<p>使立意一時無從捉摸一時士氣頓振、故於反攻時、安偶生顧得剛又連得兩「安打」并又得後方之助、得跑回本壘、製成四單○之比、</p>
<p>二壘打立意還顏色　立意受此重創、力圖恢復、於林文成陳桂森相繼出局後、高永新、由敵方一壘員之失誤、得進佔一壘、偷進第二壘、然後藉張兆元之二壘打、還以顏色、亦跑回一分、惜喜訉方來、驚耗又至、江灣黎耀華又得三壘打周崇道又跑進一分、繼而黎照華又因敵方二壘員之錯誤、又衝進一分、或者曰得不償失、</p>
<p>難恢復立意再得分　第六局開始立意聲勢赫赫張兆元、一擊得安打、李子機、繼續再一個、斯時江灣諸隊員、莫不心驚肉跳、在混局中、張兆生跑回本壘、回觀三壘、均有人在、苟立意再能於此千鈞一髮之際、得一三壘打、或本壘打、江灣之勝利、將因之危險、誰想曇花一現、陳光榮打一高球、爲安樂之由空中接得、傳與三壘、再傳至二壘、連殺三人、由此終了第七局立意無建樹、江灣遂以六比二得勝、</p>

<h3>持志奪得男球錦標</h3>
<p>四十分鐘血戰結果</p>
<p>滬江三四比四三敗</p>
<h3>丨孔廣益全塲之王丨</h3>
<p>持志籃球隊昨晚以四十三比三十四之數、克服最後之强敵滬江混合隊、奪得本屆全市運動會之錦標、鈎心鬥角、各竭所能、精彩百出、嘆爲觀止、尤以持志之孔廣益爲全塲最生色、</p>
<h3>優勝劣敗强中有强</h3>
<p>持志丨全黑丨持志丨大夏丨鐵隊丨大夏丨靑光丨滬東丨靑光丨丨靑光丨持志丨砲隊丨丨曁南丨曁南丨滬江南洋丨丨丨曁南滬江丨滬江丨持志</p>
<h3>大戰開塲疾風捲雨</h3>
<p>滬江最先得機、馮念華罰顧光道之犯規、竟然不中、陸鍾恩再罰夏澤人、紀錄方開、兩隊俱鋒鋩百倍、各逞神威、錢鼎愼一轉身避去陸鍾恩、沿邊籃下直衝、一舉而中、馮念華再罰、滬江亦再得一分、兩軍時進時退、美妙傳球、其速如飛、滿塲如疾風捲雨、勢不可當、孔廣益連得三分、錢鼎愼又加一球、錢復絆倒籃下、再罰二分、持志遂以九比三佔極優勢、滬江要求暫停、形勢乃稍趨和緩、</p>
<h3>球運太差失於分寸</h3>
<p>滬江戰略旣定、持志亦計議進攻、夏澤人在後襲進、顧光道遠射中的、孔廣益繼之破籃、持志十五比五、十七比七、相去更遠、而滬江三鋒十餘次射籃、皆差於分寸、向之百發百中者、昨晚乃一籌莫展、形勢旣佳、持志一鬆、李汝純連中五分、錢敬鏞二射二中、上半時滬江落後五分、二十一比十六、</p>
<h3>突破重防金蟬脫殼</h3>
<p>下半時起、滬江取嚴防政策、加重防務、一個緊跟一個、使持志徘徊後場、近籃不得、錢鼎愼乘𨻶急傳與孔、羣趨向孔、此一刹那、金蟬脫殼、錢已避去陸鐘恩而直向籃底、孔一揮手、錢早托之入網、神妙無窮、嘆爲觀止、</p>
<h3>大將罰出頓現緊張</h3>
<p>持志雖在此節節勝利中、三十五比二十三、以十二分超出、而後衛大將夏澤人已四次犯規罰出、後防大感動搖、陸鐘恩遂乘機急進、襲擊猛衝、遠射近投、連得六分、李汝純又加二分、滬江僅相差四分而已、時尚有七分鐘、</p>
<h3>千鈞一髮失之交臂</h3>
<p>持志呌息、力持鎭靜、孔廣益指揮三軍、不慌不亂、又中二分、滬江亦加二人追上、千鈞一髮之際、陸鍾恩衝至籃下、昂首投入、竟失之交臂而不中、此機一失、大勢乃隨諸流水而逝、持志扶搖直上、四十三比三十四卒勝九分、</p>
<h3>英雄成敗各有千秋</h3>
<p>英雄固不能以成敗論之、不妨述其勝負之因由、持志之勝、神速而已、擲射準確、自爲得勝大因、全隊完全一部機器、同進同退、速率相同、而孔廣益之堅强穩固、不折不摧、能攻能守、不愧而爲全場之王、滬江擲射機會、三與一比、然分寸之差、固球運不佳實亦綠强敵當前、把握大失、經騐不足而已、前後線速率之不匀、使前鋒遠去、後衛尚搖搖而來、敵人得充分準備、王錫良之傳球、前鋒得分、功不可滅、而其不準確之擲射、失去分數亦不少也、</p>

<h3>市工務局排球隊（麗光攝）</h3>
<p>（一）排球决賽</p>
<p>工務局勝社會局　二比一</p>
<p>統觀兩隊戰將、實力相等、社會局人材整齊、藝無高下、工務局之黃遠光蔡濟英等、均屬健者、餘子略遜、第一局社會迎拒有方、穩健迫擊、以二十一對十七先居上風、第二局工務黃遠光蔡濟等兩員健將、發球準疾、勢似殞石、社會幾無以禦之以七對二十一敗挫、第三局成爲勝負决賽關頭、故雙方之精神益奮、相隨進分、各不相下、後排導托、中排推抬、前軍躍擊、各盡平生之力、結果工務以二十二對二十再勝一局、而奏凱歌、</p>

<p>（二）足球預賽</p>
<p>（一）敎育局勝衛生局　　三比零</p>
<p>（二）公安局勝公用局　　二比一</p>
<p>（三）土地局勝工務局　　三比零</p>
<p>敎育局與衛生局之賽、在初時勢均力敵、入後敎育局漸見强硬、右翼楊佩文尤脚頭正確、迭建殊勳、成績上半時二對○、下半時一對○、公安局與公用局之賽、精神較前場爲多、以個不乏老手也、上半時公安局前鋒傳球猛衝、一獲一球、但公用亦於刹那間還以顏色、下半時仍相持不下、觀者方謂勝負將無從判分矣、詎公用局内衛不愼觸手被罰十二碼球、額外損失、以致敗挫、洵屬不幸、土地局與工務局、上半時紛駛逐鹿、各無所獲、堪稱棋逢敵手下半時之始、仍對峙不下、俄而土地銀出奇襲擊、獲得一球、紀錄旣開、順流而下、霎時間續獲二球、工務幾乏抵抗之策、此非實力之遠差、乃士氣之轉移也、</p>
<p>（三）籃球預賽</p>
<p>（一）市政府勝土地局　四十五比二十一</p>
<p>（二）社會局勝衛生局　五十九比十九</p>
<p>四隊球藝、均頗可觀、比較的以市府及社會局爲優、市府戰土地局、兩衛監敵極嚴、左鋒宗孝杰、馳騁敵陣中、劫球射籃、如入無人之境、獨獲二十二分、可謂勇矣、社會局戰衛生局、前半時雙方堅持、得二十二對十六之比、衛生局雖出兵不利、紀錄之差尚不甚遠、下半時則一落千丈、社會局增三十七分、而衛生局僅獲三分、致成五十九比十九之慘敗、</p>

<p>（覆）接讀來函、對君旣表敬意又多憫惻、這種情緒、也不必細細講說了、過而能改、本是無上的道德、况且君以曾受敎育之人、不得已而爲此、必定爲環境所逼、嚴格說來、社會上也應負一部分責任、不能完全歸過於君了、至於可改之業、塗徑甚多、以君受過敎育、用靈敏之心思、活潑之手段、耐勞耐苦之精神、去謀一小小的服務、必定可以得到、即使收入少些、然而職業穩定、天君泰然、能儉便可以養廉了、君說以前的收入、不過嫖賭浪費、現在旣悟其非、力能戒除、自然也不至於不夠、至於以前的歷史、固然不是光榮的一葉、然而改過之後、倒也不必内疚於心、在前清咸豐同治之間、湖南有個積竊、名呌羅思舉、犯案纍纍、後來投入曾營、屢建戰功、陞授提督之職、做官一清如水、愛民如子、地方人士、無不愛戴、死後還有䘏典、他在任的時候、曾經親自行文各州縣、凡是他從前做而未破的案件、一律註銷、並且、明是本人做的、不必再行追求、當時上司同僚、也沒有因而歧視他、並且有一位同事、曾經當衆問他、他說思舉做賊還做官、諸公做官還做賊哩、細細體會此言、君必然可以領悟、至問何處得到正軌的職業、怕要廣托朋友、留心機會、不過君該先下决心、敬謹勸君、速本良心上之驅使、决心改業、並祝頌君以後的發展成功、</p>
<h3>姜秀峯君訊</h3>
<p>我現在是商店的一個職員、辛金所入、足以維持家中開銷、合本人的正當用項、但自華僑被戮事件後、生意無形蕭條、現在商號亦受此影響、不遠就待收束、本人藉以維持身家的金井、將隨石沈、若仍由此地謀生活、亦未嘗不可、但是只可圖安一時、究非遠久之策、以此欲歸祖國、冀謀永久營業、但苦無門可敲入、我的决意、是欲歸國到東三省、此舉不但無門可入、且聞云東省商業、因景氣不佳萎頽殊甚、失業人口、在在皆是、以此堅决之意又歸猶豫、但是爲身家生活關係、不得不先事打算、若祇個人問題、解决猶易、因閱歷所得、餬口小題、總可不成問題、只是嗷嗷待哺者、難於維持耳、旅鮮吾僑、經被戮後、歸者過半、其不能遽然言歸者、大都犯了上述之困難了、不只我一個人如是、貴報存有拯救社會癓結之心、祈將上述難决問題、代决報端、我的感激是不容說了、旅外僑胞之有犯同樣困難者、諒亦均感激焉、（下略）</p>

<h3>王祖鉉君訊</h3>
<p>自從貴報增加了讀者通信以後、我相信貴報今後替讀者不知又要解决多少疑問啦、我和其他許多讀者一樣、在此感謝、並望貴報繼續努力、中國的敎育、一向是偏於空談而不尚實際、換句話說、便是不着重生產的敎育、所以結果、只弄成一批手無縛雞之力的、只會消費而不事生產的學者、到今日、敎育幾乎到了破產的地步、以中國之生產落後、本是不該有的現象、中國是處於次殖民地的地位、所以成了列帝國主義者商品的活動天地、以上海而論、工廠羅布、商店林立、何嘗不是充溢着外人經濟的勢力、反之、中國現在的情形如何、每件事業、不是仰外人的鼻息、便是毫無蓬勃的氣象、所以在職業界一方面、是外國的洋行需要買辦、跑街、和能打字能操英語的練習生······等類、去帮着推廣洋貨、在中國方面、却是粥少僧多、沒有揷足的餘地、國營工廠商店、不但沒有一些新氣象、却倒閉的倒閉、不倒閉的也在苟延殘喘中、在這種情勢之下、一般人却在高唱着「敎育職業化」或「提倡職業敎育」等的調兒、這使我不能發生下面幾個疑團、（一）「鄰之厚、我之薄也、」外國經濟、在中國强、一分、便是中國經濟的弱一分啦、提倡職業敎育者、在外人經濟鐵腕包圍着中國的當兒、要想造就許多洋行走狗推廣洋貨、摧殘中國經濟置吾國人於死地而後快、是不是、（二）我想要使中國生產發達經濟轉機、决不是造就幾箇職業人材、所可補於大局的、因爲中國根本缺乏的是職業、而不是職業人材、是不是、（三）照以上兩點看來、提倡職業敎育、也和其他的敎育一樣地不着癢處、而毫無裨益、抑或有害（他們往往以歐美日本爲例、那知歐美日本的社會、根本就與中國不同呢、我是一個受過中等敎育的（所受的也是職業敎育、）學生、現在處在失業的境地、一方面爲我自已悲、他方爲大多數靑年恐慌、我希望貴報將以上的疑團、給一箇圓滿的答復、並望發表在貴報上、給大多靑年以一箇指導、謝謝</p>
<p>（覆）君對現社會觀察得深切而且正確、吾們狠佩服的、不過所發三箇問題、吾們的看法還有多少異同的地方、</p>
<p>（一）職業敎育、是敎人生活的知識和技能、同時還該注重人格、君所說造就洋行走狗、推廣洋貨等、大槪看見洋貨業中人、多學過商業、能說洋話、打洋字、因而疑到商業學校有這種種功課、即是以造成這種服務洋行人員爲唯一目的、其實不然、商業學校敎人說外國話、打外國字、何嘗敎人替洋人說話打字、假使吾人認定替洋人說話打字是不該的、那末等於一箇人因喫飯過量或不潔致病、而疑給人吃飯、是害人的、君想說得通嗎、而况職業敎育有種種、商業敎育、不過其中的一種罷了（三）說到中國根本缺乏的是職業、不是職業人材君大槪看到現今百業不興、雖有人材、怕無用處、這句話不能說完全沒有理由、不過如果要興百業、沒有人材能興嗎、現今的弊病、還是在造成人材不合需要、請看許多地方要專門人才、至今還沒有找到哩、昨日報上不是登載敎育部准鐵道部咨請通令培植土木工程專才、以應需要麽、（三）說到提倡職業敎育、和其他敎育一樣、沒有搔着癢處、這句話頂中肯、原來職業敎育、乃至一般敎育、都該以適應需要爲原則的、萬不能看到外國需要什麽、就認中國有同樣需要、這就是現今敎育失敗的一大原因、</p>
<p>所以辦職業敎育的、和受職業敎育的、都該注意到社會需要這一點、</p>

<p>我以爲二人的話都不錯，衹是各人的觀點不同罷了。皛父所說是爲用人者下針砭，大才小用則小才自必大用，甚而至於專用；小才大用則大才自必小用，甚而至於無用。受了社會付托掌有用人權的，弄得許多人不得其所，豈不糟糕！紫老的話志在爲自律者說法。有大才，定要做大事，立刻就要做大事而不肯從小做起，心理上便不免有怨望，閱歷上也沒有堅實穩固的基礎，如何不將以求大而適見其小呢？</p>
<h3>張嗇公軼事</h3>
<p>— 印瘦曼</p>
<p>南通張嗇公。原名育才。字樹人。至丁丑（光緒三年）始更名騫。字季直。（周彥昇有更名篇詩寄之）與揚州束畏皇。泰興朱曼君。如臯顧錫爵。海門周彥昇等。爲莫逆交。俱以文章才藻。蜚聲州鄕。時稱爲江北五才子。其後張漸顯貴。餘皆鬱鬱不得志。而往返交誼。未嘗以顯蹇之珠。稍易其心。一日。顧錫爵舟經通城。以歸心甚急。過張氏之門而未入。及張聞知。急追至唐閘。（距城十六里）始獲相見。登舟把晤。談笑甚歡。至暮色蒼茫。方各珍重而别。</p>
<p>嗇公之文章學識。固爲世人所景仰。而其待人接物。尤覺仁和可親。故地方人士。迄今仍歌誦不止也。余憶某次。張自城南某紳處宴罷回家。時已黃昏。以所乘之包車未曾燃燈。爲望仙橋畔之崗警所阻。謂依律須罰洋四角。車夫正欲置辯。張急止之。探囊出小銀幣四枚與之。事後。有識張者謂警曰。此四先生也。爾奈何加以罰鍰。警聞言。惶悚不已。私念必遭嚴責無疑矣。詎至次日。警局忽得張函。深嘉某警之能執行警律。不稍寬假。特奬洋二元云。余謂某警之能執法不足奇。惟張氏之以身守法爲可貴耳。</p>
<h3>世界小事記</h3>
<p>新發明的特别鬧鐘凡是職業的人。身爲職務所覊。不得不早起。而有時睡得太着。不能準時而起。於是不得不在枕邊放一架鬧鐘。可是那鬧鐘聲太鬧。往往驚醒了别人的好夢。最近英國方面。就有人發明一種特别的新式鬧鐘。是將鐘與留聲機并合在一起的。到了一定的時候。那留聲機上的片子自會開動。奏一支催人起身的曲兒。任是沈睡的人。也不會不醒的了。</p>
<p>以蝸牛爲珍饌　吾國廣東人吃蛇吃貓吃蜜鼠。大家以爲是咄咄怪事。那麽法國人以蝸牛爲珍饌。也不能不算是奇蹟了。據說這種蝸牛。與尋常的蝸牛。截然不同。它們的食料。是生菜與葡萄的葉子。所以非常潔凈而腴美。價格很貴。在最高等的宴會中方可吃到。普通餐膳。决無此物。英國上流社會中。近亦喜食蝸牛。每年蝸牛之由法國輸入倫敦。計有二百萬餘頭之多。（海客）</p>
<h3>上海預防大水之趣聞</h3>
<p>— 芮鴻初</p>
<p>上海自一丈二尺大水之謠言傳播後。一般居民。咸起杞憂。日來陰雨時作。是以頭腦簡單者。恐慌更甚。人謂海上文明甲全國。孰知海上迷信亦不落人後。洵可一粲。茲將最近數日中。所聞見之預防水災趣事。拉雜書之。</p>
<p>油米業利市三倍　本市數日來。如油米醬酒煤炭等。受大水謠之影響。居民爭先恐後。預事購買。故各業翻得利市三倍。聞諸業中尤以油米爲最獲利云。</p>
<p>旅行箱權作米桶　靜安寺路雪園里。有無錫籍少年夫婦。因夫現供職於滬上某銀行。今春二月。特賃亭子間於該里。伉儷甚篤。不忍一步離。此番惡謠傳出。見鄰居均躉糧防災。因於昨日亦斛石米送家。但行裝素簡。苦乏貯存之所。結果盡出衣服。將米裝納提箱中。婦語人云。倷俚弄得團團轉嘸法想了。</p>
<p>七十老翁習游泳　小東門某烟紙店。有一老叟。年逾古稀。生平不諳游泳。且亦不喜游泳。近忽變更態度。時習游泳之術。說者謂翁亦受大水謠之影蠁云。</p>
<p>經年仇怨一時消　予寓之對門。樓上爲一黃姓。樓下爲一吳姓。同居以來。已近三年。去歲五月。黃以欠吳欵涉訟。自後二宅茶水不相通。今年八月梢。而樓下吳姓婦忽以大宗禮物餽黃。意至殷勤。必使黃非受不可。斯時黃固不解。直至本月初。吳宅所有珍貴衣物箱籠絡續丐存黃處。黃至此。始悉吳突然親善之意。蓋亦由於預防大水之波及也。</p>
<h3>請明令停止錢塘觀潮</h3>
<p>— 逋居士</p>
<p>浙江之有海潮。自古以爲患。未聞引爲樂觀也。遜清舊制。浙江設東中西三防同知。分段管轄。專治塘務。督撫以時履勘。察其塘身之是否穩固。柴料木石之有無積儲。而黜陟進退之。至秋大汎。則於潮漲之先。愼防其沖刷。潮退之後。亟理其工巡。蓋惴惴焉惟恐怒潮之猝至也。自近十年來。始有錢江觀潮之盛會。乃至滬杭路特開專車。海寗當地徧設行館。車水馬龍。數日乃罷。公私耗費。以巨萬計。當太平豐樂之時。聯袂壯游。徵奇覧勝在愛惜日力者。猶或非之。居今日而言浙江之潮。恐有不暇觀。不忍觀。又或不敢觀者。</p>
<p>比歲匪患之熾　軍務之殷。幾於日不暇給。今且内憂未已。外患滋深。此正當局枕戈待旦之秋也。又况天災流行。洊及一十六省。政府方汲汲籌運民食。救濟水災。賢豪者流。就上海及各省區。集議賑卹。婦孺則分赴各界勸募。此又舉國皇皇。食不甘味。寢不安席之會也。今使軍人釋其戎衣。政界輟其前箸。士流皆不恤噬臍。而爲游目騁懷之舉。所謂不暇觀者此也。</p>
<p>今之陸沈巨浸。延頸而待命者。以鄂之武漢三鎭。蘇之高寳各區爲最甚。此乃全國之菁華。魚米財賦之自出也。試一觀夫難友流離之狀。水鄕慘澹之圖。未有不酸鼻而冰衿者。彼以洪水橫流爲奇禍。而我以巨潮洶湧爲奇觀。稍有人心。安能張目。所謂不忍觀者此也。</p>
<p>近滬上謠傳。以八月中大潮將至。此讕言原不足據。然稽之歷史。浙海固嘗泛溢。其尤甚者。唐光化三年。海溢壞民居。宋淳熙元年七月。錢塘大風濤。决隄一千六百餘丈。漂民居六百三十餘家。明時海塘出險者六次。前清同治初年。塘身被刷。幾至大决。浙撫請撥國帑至六百萬兩。沿塘悉砌巨石。而輔以坡陀之柴塘。數十年無水患。然增柴設埽。歲有常費。今塘工旣撤專員。未知濱海若何豫備。萬一潮汎適逅颶風。即不至波及各區。而觀潮諸君。豈復有立足之地。所謂不敢觀者此也。</p>
<p>然必請明令停止者。觀潮之舉。數年來幾成習慣。海寗郊外。游觀之塲。酒食之肆。以及賣買雜趁者。麕聚以謀短期之贏利。鐵路局别配客車。專程疾赴。亦有小販隨之往還。若行者裹足。而使居者虚糜。非所以體人情。惜物力也。但請令行路局。停止觀潮專車。彼登報宣傳。當地自罷設備。且使一般社會。知政府方倡率屬僚。刳心於救災弭亂。風行草偃。皆將廢除燕樂。而相戒以儉勤。我中國其庶有豸乎。</p>

<h3>扶桑雜記</h3>
<p>— 艾艾自東京寄</p>
<p>咖啡女郎的魔力（續）</p>
<p>一箇咖啡店的營業發達與否。並不在乎會做精巧的細點。或咖啡調製得濃厚得宜。他的命運是完全繫在這些神秘的女郎身上。那常常被顧客所稱贊而歡迎的女郎。是具有特殊天才的。伊能一面將端着的咖啡。凑到甲客的嘴邊。而一面和乙客談話。同時將靈活的眼波。黝黑含情的眸子。照顧了丙。照顧了丁。丙丁都恍同觸電似的有點不自然了。便是那些座位距離稍遠的客人。僅能望見女郎項背的客人。他們也都爲着伊輕盈的體態。曲綫的纖腰。富於彈性的臀部。而表示好感。總之郎們一個輕微而普通的行動。好比是一個石子投入一汪清水一樣。會擴大成無數的圓暈。而博得滿座的羨歎。女郎們很聰明。伊們看見客人們興奮的情緒。出就格外的做作。唱着迷人的小曲。表示着異樣的温存。伊們會說着平常女郎們所說不出口的話。伊們爲做出平常女郎們所做不出的笑聲。伊們的薄怒佯羞。一顰一笑。伊們的一切的一切。都使客人滿意。陶醉。沉迷。</p>
<p>這是一個疑問。研究日本民族性的學者。不都說日本人的性情很暴躁麽。何况是那些血氣方剛的靑年呢。但是在咖啡店方面看起來。他們簡直是那些女郎們所豢養的一羣綿羊。他們從那些妖艶的女郎繊手中接過來的一個不到五英吋長的小玻璃杯中所盛着的咖啡。緩緩地喝着。分十幾次的喝着。咖啡店裏的那些彈簧凳子。被客人們長時間的坐着。都有點傾斜了。呀有魔力的女郎們喲。</p>
<p>説部扶輪會</p>
<h3>丈夫的妻子（十七）</h3>
<p>— 江紅蕉</p>
<p>但是他們很老實的一同出去了。他們走了以後，陳先生一個人悶坐着，覺得妻子不但是不管家；並且每天和李先生同出同進，究竟是不妥當的。他在沒有結婚的時候，是希望得到一個善於交際的妻子，家裏的粗作，不必要妻子管的；現在已覺得這思想完全是錯誤了。他已瞧出李先生近來和自已的妻子親密得太過份，無論如何不拘禮節，一個男子站在朋友的妻子床前瞧伊只穿了一身睡衣起床，總是很少的。他想到這裏，心裏很妒恨着李先生太欺負了他，他預備另外找屋子遷住，和李家分居；他預備和李先生絕交，永遠不相往來；他預備得到一個相當機會，把李先生的不道德，公布在許多朋友面前，使他受到名譽上的懲創；但是他又想到近來李夫人也和我很親密；我不拒絕伊，這也是不道德，我們的罪惡，正是相等，不覺自已笑起來了。</p>
<p>於是他自已警戒自已，不能再增加和李夫人親密的程度。伊現在固然很可憐，得不到丈夫的愛心，但是萬一李先生回心轉意愛伊，伊當然也愛伊丈夫的，那時我一定得到一個空虚的夢，只增加些惆悵；否則，伊丈夫是永遠不愛伊，伊愛了我，我也愛了伊，但是我有我的妻子，决不能被人家知道這秘密，我的妻子知道了，更容易惹起極大的風波。現在我的妻子，或者並沒有做對不起我的事，伊只愛玩耍，不肯管理家事罷了，我應該好好勸伊，使伊安靜，逐漸地把放心收回來，也許還是一個很好的妻子？他更諒恕地想，他以爲上海的環境，足以推動女子的脚跟，走到奢華，懶惰，舒適的路上去，决不是自已妻子一個人的罪惡；李夫人的勤儉刻實，不曾被上海環境所推挽，乃是一個例外。李夫人當然是可以敬愛的人，但是伊已有丈夫了，我愛伊，放在肚子裏自已知道，千萬不要再表示給伊知道吧，這是我自已人格的試騐期，也是我名譽上危險品，再不注意，也許會演也重大的悲劇了。他想從今天起，逐漸地和伊疎遠起來，减少接近談話的機會。</p>

<h3>棉市被紗帶好</h3>
<p>棉市㣲昂　因金價平堅、紗市又現活潑氣象、人心緊俏、然外棉狀况依然不振、且各廠均有外棉購進、本棉交易杜絕、故大户抛賣心思仍烈、惟棉商仍在多頭地位、仍不放鬆云、</p>
<p>漢標㣲好二三錢　漢標前市開盤以外棉微跌、人氣仍軟、後以紗市良好、帶漲五分、午後聞紗市上漲、各月亦漲二錢、一錢五分、成交統計五萬一千九百擔、查賣出賡豐三千八百擔、梅記二千五百擔、吉豐一千六百擔、公泰一千五百擔、買進昌記二千六百擔、新豐四千七百擔、餘昶二千三百擔、茲將收盤價錄左、</p>
<p>漢標收盤價漲跌存賬數十二月三三八五漲二二二八、九００</p>
<p>十月三四一０漲二一一七、四００一月三三八０二二二０、三００</p>
<p>十一月三四０五三二二七、四００二月三三八０二一三二、四００</p>
<p>棉需又是淡極　現棉交易又清、來源計姚花一千三百九十六包云、</p>
<p>姚花三四·○○客帮中進一千五百包棧交</p>
<h3>美棉減種運動</h3>
<p>十七日鐵克塞斯州奥斯汀電、鐵克塞斯下議院對於明年减少棉用三分之二之法令、已經通過、上議院則贊成减少四分之三、南方各州大致贊成减種、惟須俟鐵克塞斯發起、因鐵克塞斯產額、占全美三分之一云、</p>
<h3>外紗花杳無起色</h3>
<p>美英印棉一致下墮　昨日美棉初因南方套賣而疲、後因空户抵補及華爾街有力而堅、計期貨跌三至五磅音、現貨跌五磅音、英棉期貨跌六至八點、現貨跌十六點、埃及棉現貨跌十五點、印棉市况疲弱、計平果爾跌一·二五羅比、奥姆辣及白羅溪跌二羅比、原電錄左、（十七日電）</p>

<h3>糧食　新穀登塲鬆落五六角</h3>
<p>南市　米市昨又旋入疲境、蓋因來源接而且夥、故雖天時繼陰、仍不能助增胃納、以致城鄕店銷益覺懈淡、成交㣲細、客方仍則貶價鬆售、厚粳行情步削三角、薄稻以松航發續抵、且價較廉銷化頓呆、價亦短三四角、論厚薄破粳、照店舖各宵不動、中秋節前、恐難轉機、蘆洋尖貨仍零星、銷亦呆滯、市勢跟疲、新蘆洋尖登塲、計抵北㘮·黎里·西塘·陶莊·四筒、因到近午開出、跌落五六角、香粳新粳各跌半元光景、</p>
<p>新閘　昨日裏路來源尚多、本街走銷呆滯、厚粳薄稻二種各低三角、買氣極靜、市上人心、近以秋節將屆、逐步下游、一因新貨登場、二以太古輪船裝來敏黨西貢小絞約二十萬包、到埠堆棧、新粳新客尖來貨尚厚、價軟四五角、陳蘆埠尖呆而不動、無榮辱、糯米陰元因受破粳影響、帶疲角許、河廠貨斛開二千石左右、</p>
<h3>小絞米跌風獨鋭</h3>
<p>▲現米小四角　▲期米小一錢</p>
<p>昨日洋米市况又復疲跌、因洋行兜售甚力、到頭不絕、貨主紛紛貶價求脫、市面立見劇大之變化、小絞米因月前旺時令中、定貨太多、跌勢更比他米爲甚、昨日竟小去四角以上、他米亦小角許、期小絞回籠貨亦狂小一錢有奇、市形仍未見站、西貢米尚居平穩、統市成交小絞三千包、價十二元七角半至十二元五角半、敏黨一百包、價十三元、小絞九月份三百噸、價六兩○五分至六兩○三分、又十月四百噸、價亦六兩○五分至六兩○三分、均係回籠貨、新交易則有大倉洋行抛出一號西貢五百噸、價六兩七錢、爲十一月份云</p>
<h3>俄麥訂購二船</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份市面、又呈不佳、因俄麥訂購、已確實訂成二船、照目下情形推測、後步尚須繼續成交、所以人心皇恐、均不免爲此種事實所壓迫、本月份最低至三兩七錢、十月·十一月份至三兩七錢四分、十二月份至三兩七錢九分、一月份至三兩八錢三分、三月份至三兩九錢一分、較前日又落二三四分不等、迨至下午開盤、初尚盤旋、後以外行空頭、步步抵補、不振之市勢、又見回振、較前日之最低價、回漲四五分不等、惟實銷壓迫過甚、後步仍難免回跌也、結果本月份較前日反好一分、十月份不動、十一月份好二分、十二月份至二月份各好一分云、</p>
<h3>粉市不振</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市面、又趨不振之象、以洋麥互有上落、出入甚㣲、至市上盛傳俄麥交易、聞確已成交二船、總數計一萬四千噸左右、一係船某行家所定、一船則係廠家、上海散倉交貨、合價三兩八錢、聞尚係試售性質、後步之成交、將看中國之需要、再定進止、因此人心不穩、本月份最低至二兩零六分二厘半、遠期亦均低落一分後、迨至下午開盤、近期因實銷客帮、曾有收進、遠期則獲利空頭、相互抵補、較上午之最低價徵見回起、惟以大勢言、前途仍無過回之希望也、結果本月份至十二月份各小二厘半、一二月份各小七厘半云、</p>
<p>糖市　抛貨粗紗白交易更盛</p>
<h3>現貨市亦略穩</h3>
<p>昨日糖市產區電訉、古巴現糖價爲一·四○六二五、比前電跌三一二五、紐約期糖九月份價一·三三、跌一分、十二月份價一·三一、未有起伏、明年三月份一·三五、亦跌一分、五月份一·五九、猛跌六分、爪哇現期糖仍乏升沉、公會劃盤、荷糖二十四號組纱白、交易殊寥、新貨十二兩六錢、二十號中砂白十一兩一錢、氣尚堅、太古糖現貨該公司又復喊漲五分、華新售開Ｂ嘜六百包、價十一兩、劃盤陳貨Ｂ嘜成交價爲十一兩○二分半、ＨＮ嘜十一兩五錢二分半至五分、市形尚挺、抛貨荷糖交易頗盛、價格續見鬆落、天祥洋行售開即裝陳粗砂白三百噸、順全隆洋行亦售出三百噸、價均五元四角半、華新兜售、仝價亦售出三四百噸、旋後更削價二分半兜攬、因致人氣轉弱、受手反寥、尚盛隆兜九月份二十號中砂白價五元二角半、十六號五元二角、行方進意尚有、但須回電作數、號盤有錦發售開現貨新租砂白一千袋、價十一兩六錢、新二十號中砂白一千袋、價十一兩一錢、比前盤雖無升降、但市象頗爲穩秀矣、</p>
<h3>閘北貨　湘蓮市價高昂</h3>
<p>銷路平平</p>
<p>湘蓮近以地價迭升、市勢堅俏、申價亦隨之而漲、查到貨存底均屬不多、故後市殊無鬆望、至於銷方、以市價高昂、不免稍形减色、昨市湘潭蓮售六十五兩、九溪蓮六十四兩、衡州蓮六十三兩、常德蓮六十兩、白蓮亦以蘭谿地價步緊、已升至五十二三兩矣、</p>
<h3>絲茶　米蘭義絲價由堅轉疲</h3>
<p>米蘭市場、義絲見新以來、因歐美動辦、絲價步漲、茲以歐銷疲滯、價均轉跌、雙特號三百九十一利拉、特號開三百四十五利拉、上等二百八十八利拉、每基羅各跌三四利拉云、</p>
<h3>高莊珍眉英銷活動</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊茶市、婺源·屯溪兩路之高莊珍眉綠茶、英莊怡和協和·福時等行、均起動辦、婺源西路貨、市盤開出一百四五十兩、較前仍無漲落、貢熙一項、俄銷續趨暢達、白頭行瑞昌·富林·謙義等行、均繼續搜辦、市面益形活潑、惟大帮綠茶、近來美銷忽趨疲滯、但本年產額大減、茶數已銷出十分之八、因之華商態度、依然堅挺、</p>
<h3>五金　白鐵瓦白鐵薄花色俏俐</h3>
<p>五金交易、邇來時旺時靜、而對於各花色趨勢、亦時俏時疲、白鐵瓦二十八號二十六號等薄花色、近日客帮交易十分興旺、本街廠家以及建築帮等莫不收辦、因此市貨供不敷求、市貨十分俏俐、價則二十八號估十六兩五號錢、二十六號十五兩五錢、其較厚花色則因走勢滯疲、故行情較廉、如二十四號售十四兩、二十二號十三兩七錢半、此外平白鐵趨况亦屬厚呆而薄活、其原由亦不外薄花色走勢之順利、行情二十八號估十七兩二錢半、二十六號十五兩七錢半、二十四號及二十二號則祇　估十四兩五錢云、</p>

<h3>南洋華僑實况的調查（一）</h3>
<p>— 丘斌存</p>
<p>說起來很可憐、我們老大的中國、因爲大多數人民沒有民族的意識、缺乏國家的觀念、和素無政治的興味的原故、以致形式上對國内言雖也和别國一樣有所謂中央的政府、對國外言雖也和别國一樣設有所謂領事也者、然而實際上我們的政府、不能替我們的國家取得國際上平等的地位、我們的領事對於「保僑」的責任更是不能擔當、現在專來說領事保僑的問題吧、</p>
<p>像日本的領事館、内部的設置至少有調查課、外事課、地理課、編修課、…等、把居留地的國勢、僑民一切的實况、都調查得清清楚楚、綱舉目張的印出刋物來、遍告國人、以决定移民的政策、　國外僑民經濟的發展、策至良善、</p>
<p>反映我國的領事館則如何、領事館祇是外部虚設的胼肢的機關、領事除只知道收取領照費簽發護照、和偕他的妻子常與洋大人交際外、無所事事、亦不知有所事事、對於測查在地國情、詳察華僑實况的重大使命、他們夢也未曾發過這個夢、</p>
<p>我們的商務代表的領事館、旣不能負此調查實况責任、我們自已幹吧、我因任西大學華僑文化部特約通訊人的名義、於往年回國前就破私費就事於華僑實况的調查的工作、結果我的計劃是失敗了、我調查的熱度也要因失敗而降至冰點了、……我所調查的範圍、包含華僑的商會、閱書報社、報社、會館、俱樂部…等有組織的團體機關、以爲從有組織的華僑團體機關入手調查華僑的實况自當較爲容易、我所送寄發出的各種調查表的地域、包含暹羅、英屬、荷屬三處、爲數也不下數百張、其實華僑在這三處的團體機關、何止數千個以上、而我所收到將調查表塡好寄回的、僅僅只有七張、不可謂非咄咄的怪事、</p>
<p>我們的民族向以一盤散沙暴露於世界、我們的國民向以無有團結精神著聞於天下、我們民族國民的劣根性、若長此蔓延下去、我們的種族國家還要有希望的嗎、丨丨至於我們僑居海外的華僑、受殖民地宗主國政府的壓迫、和殖民地土人的仇視的夾攻之下、竟有種種包有民族意識和祖國觀念的組織團體、和提高華僑文化機關在發展、不以不說是我們國族的有生機的希望、國族前途一線的光明、但是華僑國團體機關有人肯負責和辦得有精神的、也實在不易多見、不然我發去數百多張的調查表何至竟有鳳毛麟角的七張塡好付回呢、現在我也只好把這收到的七張調查表、紀錄出來作個簡單的一個小報告、</p>
<p>（一）商會</p>
<p>南洋華僑的商會、我所知道的並不多、我所發的調查也不普遍、故所收到的調查表等於零、是以對商會的實况、也無從說起、不過我所欲調查的商會的事項也可得一爲告訴閱者、這裏把調查商會實况的一個空表式列下、以期中國領事館、商會或個人能從而做切實的調查而統計之、</p>

<p>南洋華僑的報紙、大都以營利爲目的、不過近年來以營利爲目的之餘、多能振刷編輯部、力求新聞之改良、講究揷畫、增刋畫報、而趨於美術化、是其一件好事、</p>

<h3>Order</h3>
<p>The National Government, on the 18th, issued an order: "The Law on Fortress and Fortified Zone Areas is hereby enacted and promulgated." This order is issued.</p>
<p>Domestic Important Telegrams</p>
<h3>Zhang, Li, and Wu Hope the Guangdong Side Will Leave Room for Mediation</h3>
<p>The Guangdong Side Telegraphed That No Troops Have Been Dispatched</p>
<p>(Beiping) Li Shizeng, Wu Tiecheng, and Zhang Ji previously jointly telegraphed to Guangdong, appealing for peace. On the 17th, they received a reply from Guangdong, stating that the Guangdong-Guangxi armies were still stationed on the borders of the two provinces and had not advanced north. They were determined not to lightly initiate hostilities, stating that those invading Hunan were not the main force of Guangdong-Guangxi, but only a part of Tang Shengzhi's old subordinates on the Guangdong-Hunan border. Zhang, Li, and Wu conferred this afternoon to discuss a response plan, which will be sent out tonight. The general idea is to appeal to them, considering the severe national flood disaster, to think of the national crisis, support peace, dispel absolute demands, and leave room for mediation. Tiecheng told reporters that the Guangdong reply stated that no troops had been dispatched, showing that there was still a glimmer of hope for peace. They were now planning to telegraph Guangdong that if they acknowledged peace, mediation was necessary, and there could be no so-called absolute or thorough demands. If it was said that A must defeat B, or B must defeat A, there would be no mediation and absolutely no peace. Once this point was clarified, everything could be resolved smoothly. (18th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>Guangdong-Guangxi Armies Retreat to Yongzhou</h3>

(18th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>Executive Yuan Investigates Disaster Conditions in Various Regions</h3>

<h3>The Huai River Conservancy Association Holds a Plenary Meeting</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Huai River Conservancy Association is scheduled to hold a plenary meeting on the 19th to discuss issues such as commencement of construction and entry into the sea and river. At the same time, considering that the Huai River Conservancy funds, although decided to allocate 300,000 yuan from the Boxer Indemnity, are far from sufficient, it will propose to the National Government Flood Relief Committee and the Chinese and Foreign Fundraising Association and other organizations, requesting allocation of funds for subsidies. (18th Special Telegram)</p>

<h3>Xu and Fu Urge Yan to Go to Jilin</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Xueliang has been consulting with Li Shizeng, Wu Tiecheng, and others for days on the issue of Yan leaving Shanxi, and all hope that he will leave Shanxi for Beiping or go to Jilin immediately.

(18th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Xueliang summoned Xu Yongchang to the hospital yesterday to inquire about the process of Huang Luchu, Wang Ping, and others contacting Yan Xishan.

Zhang telegraphed the situation reported by Xu Yongchang to the central government last night and asked for instructions on how to deal with it. (18th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>Regarding the Nakamura Incident</p>
<h3>The Second Investigation Team Returns to Shenyang</h3>
<p>(Shenyang) Rong Zhen, chief of staff of the Northeast Border Defense Army, formally notified the Japanese Consulate General yesterday afternoon, explaining two points: (1) Guan Yuheng, the third regiment commander of the Reclamation Army, is now under serious detention in the Military Law Department and will be subject to a military law conference for serious interrogation. (2) The second investigation team will return to Shenyang on the 19th, and its investigation results will be reported at that time. (18th Teletype News Agency)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) Guan Yuheng, the third regiment commander of the Reclamation Army, who is considered the main culprit in the Nakamura Incident, replied during interrogation the night before that his subordinates may have killed Lieutenant Nakamura, but he did not know the rest. As for himself, he had no direct involvement in the killing. It is not known whether the report of the First Investigation Team is consistent with Guan's statement. As the interrogation proceeds, the Nakamura Incident has a tendency to become complicated. The Japanese side became tense upon receiving this report. (19th Teletype News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The interrogation of Guan Yuheng, a person involved in the Nakamura Incident, will begin soon. Diplomatic negotiations between China and Japan will also begin at the same time. The Japanese government will hold a cabinet meeting today to discuss specific policies. Foreign Minister Shidehara will report on the negotiation process and then present the specific policies decided at the meeting with Prime Minister Wakatsuki on the 16th, requesting a decision from the cabinet meeting. Army Minister Minami, who advocates a hard line on the Manchuria-Mongolia issue, will also express his will, or even take the opportunity to criticize Shidehara's diplomacy within the government. The cabinet meeting is expected to be tense. (18th Teletype News Agency)</p>
<p>Lindbergh Arrives in China This Morning</p>
<h3>Landing at the Jinghai Customs Wharf</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) American global aviator Anne Morrow Lindbergh, piloting the "Saint Louis Cyclone" aircraft, arrived in Fukuoka on the afternoon of the 17th. It was originally scheduled to depart for China on the morning of the 18th, and was expected to arrive in Nanjing directly at 3 p.m. Representatives from various agencies gathered at Xiaguan at 2 p.m. to welcome her. However, a notification was received from the American Consulate stating that a telegram from Fukuoka said that Lindbergh was temporarily staying for a day due to bad weather this morning and planned to depart for Nanjing on the morning of the 19th, and should arrive after 2 p.m. The representatives dispersed immediately. The Aviation Administration has now selected the naval wharf at Xiaguan as the landing site for the aircraft and borrowed naval sampans for the representatives to ride to welcome her upon arrival. The Chinese army, navy, and American warships will all send personnel to the site to take care of the situation. The American Consulate plans to invite Lindbergh to stay at the consulate, and various agencies in Nanjing will hold a grand welcome party at the Lizhi Society that evening.

<h3>The World Economic Decline: America and France Can Hardly Escape Disaster</h3>
<p>Foreign Trade Has Seen Sharp Declines; the United States Plans to Raise Tariffs to Make Up for Budget Shortfalls</p>
<p>The National Society, Paris, 17th Telegram. Although France appears to be rich, a study of its foreign trade in August shows that France can hardly escape the disaster of the world economic decline. According to trade statistics released today, the decline in France's foreign trade is unprecedented. According to the table, exports fell to 2,519,000,000 francs in July and 2,316,000,000 francs in August. The drop in imports was even greater. Imports in August were 3,190,000,000 francs, while imports in July were still 3,635,000,000 francs. In the first eight months of this year, France's foreign trade fell by a huge 13,000,000,000 francs compared to the same period last year, and the trade deficit increased sharply from 5,680,000,000 francs to 9,950,000,000 francs. The National Uprising Society, Washington, 17th Telegram. The US Department of Commerce announced today that the value of foreign trade exports in August was $165,000,000, and the value of imports was $166,000,000, the first trade deficit since 1926. As for the trade volume for the first eight months of this year, exports totaled $1,661,785,000, and imports totaled $1,447,632,000, still resulting in a trade surplus.</p>
<p>The National Society, Washington, 17th Telegram. The US President believes that the national treasury is short by 1 billion yuan, and the tax revenue is in severe deficit, which cannot be compensated by reducing government spending and issuing treasury bonds. He has decided to increase taxes. Treasury Secretary Mellon is currently planning tax increase measures and their impact, preparing to submit them to Congress this winter.</p>

<h3>Serious Situation in Britain</h3>
<p>Pound's Position Unsustainable, Governor of the Bank of England Warns Prime Minister</p>
<p>Naval Soldiers Disobey Orders, First Lord of the Admiralty Chamberlain Declares No Punishment</p>
<p>Customs Protection Policy Highly Advocated, Geneva Greatly Shocked</p>
<p>National News Agency, London, 18th: The political correspondent of the London Daily Mail stated in today's newspaper that the situation in Britain is very serious. The Governor of the Bank of England made an unusual visit to Prime Minister MacDonald in the House of Commons on Thursday evening to report on the precarious situation in the foreign exchange market. He stated that the pound's difficult position was largely due to the recent unrest in the navy and rumors of a general election. If the government does not announce that it will not hold a general election for the time being to reassure the public, it is expected that the pound will fall sharply. The London Daily Herald, a Labour Party publication, also reported that the Governor of the Bank of England visited the Prime Minister at the Parliament last night.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 17th: First Lord of the Admiralty Austen Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons tonight in response to a question from a Member of Parliament that the Admiralty has issued an order to allow investigation of the special difficulties caused by pay cuts, but declared that any further disobedience of orders would be dealt with according to military law. A great debate ensued, with the Labour Party taking the offensive, attacking the First Lord of the Admiralty, and accusing him of mishandling the pay cut issue. The First Lord of the Admiralty replied that when he took office, he saw that the order for the pay cut had already been drafted and was awaiting issuance, indicating that the previous Labour government had reached the point of completing the difficult task of actively reducing national expenditures before resigning. Former First Lord of the Admiralty Alexander stated that senior officials of the Admiralty had warned the Labour Cabinet of the dangers of pay cuts, anticipating this phenomenon. As for the pay cut order, it was tentative, and the details had to be discussed with the Chancellor of the Exchequer before it was issued. Austen Chamberlain was about to reply when Prime Minister MacDonald rose from his seat and said that the Admiralty had advised the Labour government that sailors could faithfully accept pay cuts, but with two conditions: (1) All those serving in public undertakings must have equal pay cuts; (2) Unemployment benefits must be adequately reduced. After the House of Commons heard the Prime Minister's words, supporters welcomed them enthusiastically, while opponents unanimously rose to support a motion proposed by a Labour MP, advocating an immediate adjournment to discuss the extremely important public issue of naval unrest. After the disturbance subsided, the opposition parties questioned the First Lord of the Admiralty and demanded that there be no disciplinary action for the navy's disobedience. However, the Labour Party made it clear that it did not approve of sailors disrupting discipline. Austen Chamberlain then replied that past offenses would not be pursued and that the navy's pay cuts were not as large as rumored, with reductions of up to 50%. The army and air force also had the same pay cuts. Furthermore, sailors who enlisted after October 1925 had already had this reduction, and this group accounted for about 25% of the national navy. Now, the Admiralty has ordered that special hardships be investigated as soon as possible and reviewed by the commander-in-chief, but the government will never allow its deficit reduction plan to be affected. Alexander, representing the opposition party, expressed his satisfaction with the First Lord of the Admiralty's statement. The Labour Party then withdrew its motion to adjourn.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 17th: Financial Secretary to the War Office, Cooper, stated in the House of Commons tonight that the Cabinet has organized a committee to investigate the hardships that may arise in the army due to the implementation of pay cuts.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 17th: The German Communist Party's Red Flag newspaper published an article inciting British sailors, advising them to disarm the crew and expel them. The authorities have now banned the publication of the newspaper for one month.</p>
<p>Reuters, Wellington, 17th: Here, two British ships with 200 sailors remained silent upon hearing the news of the pay cuts. There are also two cruisers whose sailors' monthly salaries are paid by the New Zealand government. Although they are not affected by the British government's deficit reduction plan, they must also reduce their salaries by one-eleventh, like other agencies.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 18th: Last night, the Liberal Party in Parliament made remarks against a general election, and the business community also expressed disapproval of holding elections at the present time. However, those who pay attention to politics generally believe that the National Government will soon appeal to the people on the issue of tax rates. All important government matters will be quickly passed in both Houses so that Parliament can be dissolved on October 9 and voting can take place on October 19. Last night, the Prime Minister met with representatives of the banking sector. It is heard that the bankers demanded that a general election not be held until the British gold exchange rate crisis has passed. However, there are also rumors that what the bankers are concerned about is only the method of protecting British gold during the election period. After meeting with the bankers, the Prime Minister held a cabinet meeting at 9:30 to consider the matter. Its policy will be announced in a few days. If an election is held, the current government will fundamentally change its financial policy from beginning to end. Snowden has always disapproved of using tax rates as a tool to remedy the current financial difficulties, and the Liberal Party's Samuel also advocates free trade and has not changed his thinking due to the current panic. MacDonald's attitude is undecided. When Baldwin joined the new cabinet, he declared to the Conservative Party that the organization of the new government was solely for the purpose of implementing necessary methods to balance the budget and restore national debt credit. Therefore, the Conservative Party agreed to join the cabinet for a limited time. From this, it can be seen that there is no issue of permanent combination. The new government exists to carry out a certain task. When this task is completed, Parliament should naturally be dissolved. The idea of protecting domestic industries to seek Britain's eternal prosperity is not only advocated by those who support tax rates, but also by those who have always advocated free trade, such as Mr. Chikai, Mr. Renshiman, and Sir Simon. If Baldwin believes that the urgent issues that the National Government must deal with have now passed, and the cabinet committee is now considering methods to maintain the balance of national trade, and there is also a report in favor of restricting imports, then the holding of a general election next month is inevitable.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 17th: The focus of the International Parliamentary Committee meeting shifted today from the Political Committee to the Special Committee. The crowd was quite shocked at Britain's adoption of a customs protection system. The French Minister of Commerce, Loree, spoke first, stating that the general situation in Europe was very dangerous and that it was urgent to take action to save it. The tide of unemployment is becoming increasingly turbulent, threatening to overturn the continent. All countries should not hesitate to make sacrifices and work together in the same boat. Next, German representative Posse stood up and declared that the calls for cooperation and sacrifice were highly advocated, but tariff barriers were also growing taller and taller, which seemed to run counter to solving Europe's current crisis. The last country in the world to advocate free trade will inevitably be swept into the whirlpool. Looking at the future, he could not help but feel terrified. The German representative strongly opposed the adoption of a customs protection policy to protect domestic industries, and at the end, he requested the committee to quickly study everything in order to obtain practical results.</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Prevention First, Short-Term Measures</h3>
<p>The political administration of the Qing Dynasty was lacking. Officials were sloppy and became the norm. Nothing was being done. The only thing that was focused on was the major project of the Yellow River waterway, which was related to the lives of the people in several provinces. Special officials were appointed to supervise the matter. They did not dare to be negligent in the annual maintenance project. No matter how difficult it was, it had to be completed before the rainy season. Once the rainy season arrived, storms could come at any time. If it was not completed, a major storm would inevitably wipe out all previous efforts and cause great harm. The recent sea dike at Jinshanwei is a clear example. The repair work was not completed and a sudden typhoon struck, sweeping more than half of the new construction into the ocean. Therefore, those responsible for water management projects during the Qing Dynasty never dared to be negligent. If they were, they would be subject to the most severe punishment. As for emergency repairs, there was no room for delay, because the lives of tens of millions of people in danger were hanging by a thread in the hands of those responsible. This was absolutely not like other construction projects that could be delayed slightly. Now that the flood season is about to pass, and the emergency repairs are completed, it is time to send officials to inspect the river and sea dikes and dams in detail, one by one. After the frost falls, major repairs should be carried out. After this major typhoon, even in places that were not in danger, the dikes must have been impacted and damaged. If repairs are not made now, then when the flood season comes next year, there will be panic and helplessness again. The danger is truly unimaginable. If a full repair is desired, then now is the time to plan and prepare. If we continue to be as negligent as before, with empty words every day and no action, then the time for construction in these six months will pass in an instant. Even if we want to repair, it will be too late. However, looking back at the current situation in the country, we cannot help but worry. Take the Grand Canal as an example. The so-called emergency repairs at the breaches in Jiangbei are still very difficult. Either the water has not receded and construction cannot be started, or there is a lack of materials and funds and work cannot begin. The temporary project is still being delayed day by day and cannot be completed quickly. If we want to take a further step and plan for the future, and carry out major repairs to restore the annual maintenance, is it not even more difficult? As the saying goes, "The thief has left the gate." The Chinese have always had a prevention policy like this. Now, the sudden intrusion of the flood is a great and cruel thief to our people. If we do not repair the flood prevention gate quickly, then when the flood comes again in the future, what method will we use to defend against it?</p>
<p>The above-mentioned repair project is only a short-term measure. However, today, short-term measures are the most urgent. After our country's revolution, we have been advocating the spirit of revolution and working hard on construction. I secretly hope that we will temporarily put aside other constructions and work hard on water conservancy construction. I especially hope that we will shift our revolutionary spirit to work hard on short-term water conservancy construction.</p>
<h3>Receiving Important Foreign Telegrams</h3>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 18th: Today, five countries, Belgium, Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, and Sweden, jointly submitted an important proposal to the Second Committee of the League of Nations, requesting all countries not to change their tax regulations or commercial policies, so as to avoid disrupting economic balance and aggravating the situation. The motivation for this proposal is fear that Britain will change from a free trade system to a protectionist system.</p>
<h3>Informal Silver Conference</h3>
<p>First Meeting Held in the French Capital</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 18th: The informal conference to study the silver problem held its first meeting here yesterday and continued its discussions today. The conference is hosted by the International Chamber of Commerce and invites experts from Britain, France, India, China, Japan, the United States, and other countries to participate. The conference does not aim to find a way to stabilize silver prices, but rather to discuss ways to prevent silver prices from fluctuating violently. An official of the International Chamber of Commerce, when talking to a Reuters reporter this afternoon about the current state of silver, said that the silver conference's proposal originated from the semi-annual meeting of the Washington Chamber of Commerce in May of this year. At that time, it was not clear what kind of benefits this kind of conference would have. Later, the Board of Directors adopted a resolution to select an independent private expert committee to review the various sections belonging to the specialty so that the Board of Directors of the Chamber of Commerce could determine policies. Currently, the work of the committee has not yet been completed. He hopes that the report can be submitted when the Board of Directors of the International Chamber of Commerce meets on October 23 of this year.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 18th: Lord Hunsdon, who is famous for advocating bimetallism to save the world's economic woes, declared today that he will move in the House of Lords on September 30, requesting the government to consult with the governments of the various autonomous territories and the United States on the need to raise current wholesale prices and the desire to deal with the silver problem, so that the price of silver can be raised to an appropriate rate to increase the purchasing power of most of the world's people.</p>
<h3>Gandhi Proposes Suggestions to the Indian Federal Structure Committee</h3>
<p>Has Minor Criticisms of the Conference's Chaotic Steps</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 17th: Gandhi attended the meeting of the Indian Federal Structure Committee today and said that the advisers of the British Emperor should put forward concrete methods. In his opinion, the proceedings of the meeting seemed chaotic and lacked direction. These were criticisms of the British government. Chairman Sankey agreed to bring Gandhi's suggestions to the government's attention. Gandhi then stated his views on the issue of the Indian parliamentary representative system, saying that he advocated that all adults should have the right to vote, and that every 500,000 people should elect one representative, and that the representatives elected should elect members of the Indian Federal Assembly. This would avoid creating unwieldy electoral districts. He opposed the Second Chamber. In addition to the disputes between Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs, and the interests of the untouchable classes, he also opposed the separate treatment of any special interests.</p>

<p>Reuters, Alexandria, 18th: The Egyptian government received news from Washington today, stating that the U.S. authorities believe that convening an international conference to consider the current state of the world cotton industry is not necessary.

Egypt also advocated the organization of an international committee to study the problem of surplus cotton in order to equalize world cotton prices, but this proposal also did not receive the support of the United States.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Madrid, 18th: The draft constitution text passed on Wednesday, stipulates that Spain is a laboring republic, which may soon be revised. The Radical Party has now repented of its overzealous move, fearing that it will cause misunderstandings. Prime Minister Zamora, in order to salvage the situation, has proposed a motion to return the case to the Constitutional Committee for review. It is expected that the committee will find a compromise solution, roughly stipulating that Spain is a free and democratic republic based on labor.</p>

<p>Telegram from Tianjin: To the Shanghai Shenbao, Regarding the matter of the Tianjin Xin Tianjin Bao being banned and suspended today, a telegram to the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee stated, "To the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee in Nanjing, The Tianjin Xin Tianjin Bao has been established for seven years, with great effort, and has been praised by society and has a very rich circulation. Previously, due to mistakenly adopting the news from the Electrical Communications Agency that He Yingqin was assassinated, two corrections were made according to the circumstances. The Municipal Party Department has already understood and forwarded it to your department. However, on August 18, the Tianjin Municipal Government suddenly imposed a ban on the grounds of a central government order. Colleagues are deeply saddened and have jointly appealed to the Municipal Government to release it. There has been no result as of the 20th. The newspaper was forced to temporarily suspend publication on New Year's Day, not only causing colleagues to lose a good friend but also bearing the public opinion of the people and protecting labor. It can be used to adjust current abuses. We dare to ask for forgiveness for its past faults and observe its future effects. Please forward the telegram to the Tianjin Municipal Government to comply with the order and facilitate its resumption of publication, awaiting orders." and other words.

<p>Telegram from the Anhui Northern Flood Relief Association: To the Shanghai Shenbao, forwarded to all charitable organizations, Northern Anhui is located in the central hub of the Changhuai River, and it is also where the waters of the Ying, Wo, Fei, Qian, Huai, and Hui rivers converge. The collapse of the Huai Dike in the upper reaches and the eruption of mountain floods have inundated more than a thousand miles, leaving people with nowhere to return. The reason is that water conservancy is not well managed, resulting in disasters in nine out of ten years. This time, the floods are reaching the sky, encompassing the territory of twenty-one counties. Except for the mountains and high hills, everything has become a swamp. Cries are heard everywhere, and refugees are on the road. The old and weak are buried in the bellies of fish, and the strong are scattered in all directions. In addition, the Huai River is met by the Yangtze River and has no way to the sea, so those submerged in the water have not retreated for two months. Tens of thousands of acres of vast ocean, with nearly ten million victims. How can they survive this catastrophic catastrophe? The people of Northern Anhui are simple and have no way to appeal. Although various charitable organizations have been rescuing them, the disaster area is too wide, and a drop in the bucket is of no help. The colleagues of this association care about their hometown and feel the pain deeply. Therefore, we have gathered representatives from the disaster areas of twenty-one counties, cities, and towns to initiate the organization of the Anhui Northern Flood Relief Committee in Bengbu. In addition to submitting the case to the National Government and the Provincial Government for filing, we hereby sincerely send a telegram, hoping that your newspaper will show compassion for the backwardness and convey it to various charitable organizations, treating them equally, so that the supply of righteousness and kindness will continue to flow. The colleagues respectfully bow nine times to ask, Chairman of the Anhui Northern Flood Relief Committee Zhou Yushan, Standing Committee Members Gao Weixuan, Chen Ziheng, and others, along with ten million victims from twenty-one counties, cities, and towns, respectfully beg.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Government Decides to Dredge the San Mao You River</h3>
<p>▲ Compensation for Tenant Farmer Losses May Be Subsidized by the Provincial Government</p>
<p>▲ Li Mingyang to Depart Immediately for Dongtai to Conduct On-Site Investigation</p>
<p>Representatives from Dongtai, Xinghua, and three other counties, Fang Yuechen, Mei, and others, paid a morning visit to Provincial Governor Ye on this, the 18th, to petition for the dredging of the Mao You River. Governor Ye verbally agreed to four points: 1. Thoroughly dredge the soil dams and hidden dams within the San Mao You; 2. Dredge the levees of uncultivated wasteland belonging to companies (Yulong, Renfeng, and other districts); 3. All tenant farmer losses will be approved for subsidies from the provincial government; 4. Please dispatch Director Li Mingyang to Dongtai immediately to conduct an on-site investigation and handle the matter.</p>
<p>Previously, the Jiangsu Provincial Government dispatched commissioners He Haiqiao and Xu Ji, together with Councilor Zhang from the Pacification Commissioner's Office, leading a battalion of soldiers to Dongtai to oversee the dredging of the Mao You River. On the 8th of this month, the Yancheng, Yanfu, Taidong, and Xinghua Flood Relief Association also sent a telegram on behalf of the provincial government, proposing the establishment of a committee to not only dredge the San Mao You River but also quickly open the water-blocking dams of companies, followed by the dredging of 800 zhang, to address the urgent situation. The provincial government instructed the association, stating that the case had been reported by Section Chief He Yu via telegram, indicating that he had discussed with Dongtai County Magistrate Huang and various representatives regarding all methods for dredging the 800 zhang, and work could commence this morning. The soil dams of the companies in the Mao You had been automatically opened. Concurrently, a telegram was sent to the section chief, urging continued supervision of the prompt commencement of work on the soil dams in the Mao You. On the same day, the Civil Affairs Department also sent a telegram on behalf of the provincial government, stating that according to a telegram from the Yancheng Taihe Company Board of Directors, the company had preemptively dug rivers and built sluice gates to discharge water for the salt fields, but now the cultivated areas with unobstructed waterways are being forcibly destroyed, posing an imminent disaster. They requested a joint inspection and instructions. On the 11th, the provincial government instructed the Civil Affairs Department to instruct the Yancheng County Magistrate to investigate and handle the matter properly. On the 12th, the Dongtai County District Party Headquarters telegraphed the provincial government, requesting the recall of Commissioners He and Xu, and ordering the county to promptly open all levees, sluice gates, and dams of the company, and further oversee the dredging of 800 zhang. On the same day, the provincial government telegraphed the Dongtai County Magistrate and Commissioners He and Xu, stating that the provincial government had resolved to order Dongtai County to open all outlets to the sea and dispatch personnel to dredge 800 zhang, connecting to Wangjiagang, entirely as a plan for flood discharge and disaster relief, with absolutely no private interests for the company. They hoped for earnest persuasion of the masses to avoid misunderstandings and requested a detailed report on the progress of dredging the 800 zhang. Simultaneously, the County District Party Headquarters was notified via telegram. On the 15th, the provincial government received a telegram from Commissioner He from Dongtai, stating that the 800 zhang had commenced dredging, and the companies were being held accountable for promptly dredging the thoroughly cleared soil dams in the Mao You to facilitate water discharge. They were currently accompanying Construction Department Technician Xu on an inspection of the five ports to the sea, etc. It is heard that the provincial government's opinion on the downstream water discharge issue is to prioritize weighing the importance and striving for smooth discharge as the standard. As for the company's interests, if they do not harm downstream water discharge, the government is happy to protect them. To seek more concrete plans, Commissioner Li Mingyang will personally go to conduct an on-site investigation in the coming days.</p>
<p>There is Absolutely No Opening of the Eastern Dam</p>
<h3>No Such Proposal in Southern Anhui Counties</h3>

The department had immediately telegraphed the county to strictly prohibit it and dispatched personnel to investigate. According to the returning personnel's telegram, they had jointly inspected and confirmed that the dam foundation was intact, and there was absolutely no opening. The local authorities were closely guarding it, etc. In addition to separate telegrams, it is imperative to inform you and immediately announce it to the public, cautioning against easily believing rumors and causing unnecessary alarm. Civil Affairs Department Director Hu Yin.</p>
<p>The Anhui Provincial Government's Reply to the Jiangsu Provincial Government Telegram Jiangsu Provincial Government Governor Ye Chu-cang, respected sir: Your telegram is respectfully acknowledged.

<h3>Jiangsu Civil Affairs Department Strictly Prohibits Trafficking in Disaster Victims' Children</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Civil Affairs Department yesterday telegraphed the Provincial Public Security Bureau and various county magistrates, stating that this year's continuous rain has caused a disaster unprecedented in decades. Many disaster victims in various counties have been displaced, selling their children in an attempt to survive. This situation is truly lamentable. However, it has recently been heard that there are greedy individuals who dare to take advantage of the situation, trafficking in disaster victims' children to seek profit. The director of this department, in order to protect the flesh and blood of disaster victims and uphold social morality, hereby telegraphes you to promptly order your subordinates to strictly investigate and prohibit such activities at all times. If any of the aforementioned situations occur, impose severe punishment without leniency. Sincerely, Civil Affairs Department Director Hu Yin.</p>
<p>A Petition from the Yancheng, Yanfu, Taidong, and Xinghua Flood Relief Association</p>
<h3>Urgent Appeal for Dafeng and Yuhua to Quickly Dredge the Mao You River</h3>
<p>Since the breaching of the canal dike, the counties downstream have suffered increasingly severe flood disasters. Repairing the breach is difficult to accomplish quickly, so we must urgently seek a solution by opening outlets to the sea. Previously, the provincial government commissioned Section Chief He Haiqiao, along with Construction Department Technician Xu Ji, and Councilor Zhang from the Pacification Commissioner's Office, leading a team to Dongtai to open the San Mao You and water-blocking dikes and dams within the Dafeng and Yuhua companies' enclosures. They arrived in Dongtai on the evening of September 6th and immediately convened a meeting, deciding to first open the Mao You River and all dikes and dams obstructing the westward flow of water to the sea, and then dredge 800 zhang. Dongtai County Magistrate Huang even wrote a record of this decision, which can be verified. Upon hearing this news, all of us disaster victims celebrated as if we were being reborn. Unexpectedly, after the commissioners contacted the company, they reversed their previous decision, declaring that their mission to Dongtai was only to dredge 800 zhang, and they did not mention the Mao You River or the water-blocking dikes and dams at all. On the one hand, they fabricated a telegram to the provincial government, claiming that they had discussed all methods for dredging the 800 zhang with Dongtai County Magistrate Huang and various representatives, and work could commence this morning. The soil dams of the companies in the Mao You River had been automatically opened, etc. In reality, the company had already driven stakes to narrow the openings of the Mao You River at each estuary and added hidden dams and soil dams every seven and a half li within the river, deliberately impeding water flow to circumvent public orders and deceive the disaster victims. The opening of the dams was in name only, not in reality, only trapping the disaster victims of the five counties in a desperate situation. This time, the canal dike breach caused widespread flooding, inundating over 100,000 square li, affecting millions of people. The deaths of humans and livestock and property losses are countless, far exceeding one ten-thousandth of the company's capital and the area of land it occupies. Moreover, the land occupied by the company originally had seven rivers leading to the Doulonggang, (1) Dongyang River, (2) Jiangjiagou, (3) Xiudejiagou, (4) Xiaohaligang, (5) Modangang, (6) Dagouzi, (7) Sangang, all of which were government-owned ports to the sea. When the western waters flowed down, these were the only essential routes for water discharge. Because the Dafeng Company was established, they privately filled them up. In the face of this catastrophic disaster, even if they do not restore all the above ports to their original state to fulfill their legal responsibilities, from the perspective of human sympathy, they should also examine their conscience and quickly open all water-blocking dikes, levees, sluice gates, and dams to attempt a rescue. However, the company disregarded this, initially refusing to open them, fabricating various frivolous excuses to confuse public opinion. On the one hand, they incited tenant farmers to demonstrate with weapons, almost causing a major disaster. After repeated urging by the provincial government, they nominally agreed to open them, but still used various tricks to make the opening in name only, not in reality. Outsiders, unaware of the situation, believed that the 800 zhang had been opened and was sufficient to discharge water. They did not know that the so-called 800 zhang was a section of civilian land at the eastern end of the Mao You River leading to Wanggang, which the company had been trying to open for years but had been unable to. Now, they are focusing their work on this area to fulfill the company's wishes. The floods in the five counties remain the same, while the company's plans are achieved first. The priorities are reversed, and the essential is abandoned for the trivial. What is even stranger is that the company claims that the terrain on the coast is higher in the east than in the west, so even if all the enclosures are opened, it will be difficult to discharge water. If this is the case, what is the use of all five ports and the company's Mao You River? What is the company's justification for opening the 800 zhang? Now, if the water in the five counties were not blocked by the company's large dikes, it would have long flowed flatly into the sea. The claim that the east is higher than the west and water cannot be discharged is merely their excuse. The truth is obvious and needs no further debate. In fact, if our five counties are submerged for a long time, millions of people will become starving corpses. We ask if the company can remain safe and sound. Thinking about it later, they should realize this themselves. Recently, we have found that the important shareholders of the company are all famous people of the time. There are also those among them who are running around to beg for aid for the disaster situation in the five counties. The people of our five counties are grateful beyond words. If it were not for the matters of life, death, and interests, why would we confuse gratitude and resentment and waste our breath? However, we know that the company has worked hard to establish its current situation, and it is not easy. It would be difficult for them to sacrifice their interests for the sake of the people of the five counties, which is also a normal human sentiment. If the company can resolutely decide to not only open the Mao You River but also open multiple breaches in all water-blocking enclosures, dikes, sluice gates, and dams to discharge water as much as possible to save our millions of dying people, the people of the five counties will repay their kindness in the years to come. They can reduce their food and clothing or contribute grain and taxes to compensate for their losses. This is what we want to solemnly declare. In conclusion, the upstream blockage requires time, and the disaster relief funds in various regions are limited. The only essential thing now to solve the life and death problem of millions of people in these five counties is to open the downstream. To open the downstream, we must first open all the Mao You River and water-blocking dikes, enclosures, sluice gates, and dams of the Dafeng and Yuhua companies. The situation is urgent and allows no delay. In addition to earnestly requesting the provincial government to recognize this suffering and implement it immediately, we also hope that all sectors will provide unanimous support, advocate for righteousness, and awaken the company, so that it does not obstruct any further. We are overwhelmed with emotion and tears. We make this sincere appeal.</p>
<h3>An Appeal from the Gaoyou County Party Headquarters on Behalf of the Entire County</h3>
<p>▲ First, Begging for Relief for Hundreds of Thousands of Disaster Victims</p>
<p>▲ Second, Requesting Severe Punishment for Mao Yisheng and Li Zhongqiang</p>
<p>To the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Provincial Party Headquarters, the Provincial Government, Newspapers, and All Elders, Brothers, Sisters, and Compatriots: The Huai River is a source of disaster, and the importance of the canal dike project is recorded in history. It is closely related to people's livelihood and has long been understood by the people of the country. Gaoyou is located along the canal, close to the Five Dams. The floods it has suffered throughout history are well known to the people of the country. However, this summer, continuous rain and torrential floods caused the Huai River to swell, and the water level of the lakes and rivers gradually increased. The single canal dike was in great danger. At that time, local people ran around calling for help, making every effort to rescue the dike, hoping to reverse the disaster. However, the water conservancy authorities treated the protection of the dike and flood control as a child's play, only knowing how to enrich themselves and disregarding the overall situation. As a result, there was no one to rescue the dike, and the workers were helpless, finally leading to a rare disaster unseen for hundreds or thousands of years. Alas, what crime have the people of Gaoyou committed to suffer this catastrophe? Recalling that one month before the autumn harvest, excessive rainfall had flooded most of the farmland. As the harvest approached, the canal water continued to rise. Three dams were opened in quick succession within ten days, causing the fields and enclosures to be breached, with no harvest at all. The people of the entire county felt that their livelihoods were difficult and were planning to raise relief funds. Suddenly, on the night of August 25th, the west wind roared, and a torrential rain fell. The sub-dikes added to the canal dike were washed away. At that time, all the staff of this association, together with local military police and responsible persons from various agencies and organizations, made every effort to rescue the dike. However, the wind intensified, making it impossible to save it. The滔天巨浪 giant waves breached the canal dike, causing four breaches in the area around Qigongdian Imperial Pier, Miaoxiangkou, and Dangjunlou outside the city, with a total breach width of 380 zhang. Instantly,狂濤澎湃 furious waves surged, rushing towards the land. At that time, the river workers had already fled, and prisoners were escaping from the city. The police suppressed the situation, and gunshots rang out. People were panicked, and despite beating gongs and calling for help, no one responded. In a moment, the floodwaters were滔天 unstoppable. People woke up in their dreams and fled in droves, supporting the old and carrying the young, with cries shaking the sky. Those who could not escape in time were mostly buried in the bellies of fish. Floating corpses followed each other endlessly. Some strong people only managed to climb to the tops of trees and roofs, calling for help in a heartbreaking scene. Residences were submerged, and fields and crops were lost. The losses were immeasurable. Looking around from above, the entire area was a vast expanse of water, transformed into a swamp. Alas, the dead are gone, and the living are displaced, homeless, exposed to the wind and eating in the open, enduring all kinds of hardships. All kinds of tragic scenes are unbearable to describe in detail. Although this association has勉力勉力 managed to raise funds and organized disaster relief sub-committees with various agencies to go to the disaster areas to seek rescue urgently, the disaster area is vast, and the number of disaster victims is large. A drop in the bucket is not enough to provide universal relief. An uncountable number of people are嗷嗷待哺 waiting to be fed and sitting and waiting to die. While the weather is still mild, they can勉力勉力勉力 barely manage to hold on. Once it reaches the dead of winter, the north wind will be凛烈 piercing to the bone, and their suffering will be even more unimaginable. Recently, all industries in the county have been凋零 falling apart, their vitality has been greatly depleted. In addition to the rice shortage, there is also a lack of salt. They are constantly calling for help, but who will come to their aid? It seems that the hundreds of thousands of disaster victims who have not yet died will all suffer the same fate. We hope that our compatriots at home and abroad will generously provide relief funds to maintain the lives of the disaster victims. We also urge the government to severely punish the river management authorities, Mao Yisheng and Li Zhongqiang, who have engaged in營私舞弊 self-dealing,凟職 dereliction of duty, and殃民 harming the people, to serve as a warning to the future. On the other hand, we urge the government to quickly send special personnel to quickly堵塞 the breached canal dike to plan for the aftermath. The hundreds of thousands of disaster victims in Gaoyou are all looking forward to it. I am filled with悲憤 grief and indignation as I write this, and I cannot fully express what I want to say. Gaoyou County Executive Committee.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Agricultural Bank Provides Loans Specifically for Disaster Areas</h3>
<p>▲ In Addition to Promoting Grain Storage Pledges</p>
<p>▲ It Also Raises Livestock and Provides Seed Loans</p>
<p>The establishment of the Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank aims to support the farmers' economy and provide general farmers with reasonable organizations for various needs, to promote production. Its nature is active, which is different from other passive relief efforts. Therefore, its original charter stipulated that loans to farmers must be limited to cooperative societies, which is why it was established. Later, although cooperative societies in Jiangsu Province have gradually been established, they have not yet become widespread. The supervisory committee of the bank decided that before cooperative societies are fully developed, loans may be granted for the improvement of agricultural tools and other agricultural products. Its business scope is not as limited as before. Now, He Yushu, a member of the supervisory committee of the bank, believes that the floods in Jiangsu Province are widespread, and the dykes are breached, and the land is submerged. The entire countryside is on the verge of bankruptcy. All parties who need funds for disaster relief will look to the Agricultural Bank. The Agricultural Bank's strength is limited, but in this extraordinary disaster, it has to be slightly flexible. He proposed that in addition to the grain storage pledge that the bank originally handles, it should be promoted in Jiangbei as soon as possible, following the methods of the Changshu, Kunshan, and Wujiang branches, to prevent farmers' grain from being sold at low prices due to lack of storage space. He also proposed to set aside 70,000 yuan specifically for raising livestock in the counties along the canal and downstream and other severely affected areas, and for providing seed loans for winter crops in the areas where the water has receded this year. All applications submitted by the county government, finance bureau, property management office, and agricultural improvement farm, with the number approved jointly by the finance and agriculture departments, using agricultural improvement donations or other taxes as collateral, are eligible for loans. It is reported that the bank's supervisory committee held a meeting the day before yesterday (16th) and approved this proposal.</p>
<p>The Xun River is Gradually Receding, and the Number of Refugees is Increasing</p>
<h3>The Relief Association Dispatches Personnel to the Countryside to Distribute Relief</h3>
<p>Jiujiang Correspondence: The water level in Jiujiang has been gradually receding in recent days. Today, the customs water gauge is at 44 feet 9 inches, but the accumulated water in the city has not yet receded. Nearly 4,000 more refugees have arrived in the city, bringing the total to over 20,000, including the original 16,000. The fastest the shelter can be established is by the 20th of this month, and it can accommodate 10,000 people. The second shelter has been contracted to merchants and will be completed in 14 sunny days from the 18th, accommodating 6,000 people. Another private shelter can accommodate 1,000 people. Currently, more than 20,000 refugees are crammed into temples, and half of them are sleeping in the streets. The strong can receive two meals of porridge a day, while the weak may not get a meal for several days. Dozens of people die of starvation every day. The Shanghai Flood Relief Association believes that the disaster situation in Jiujiang is particularly severe and has specifically remitted funds to Nanchang, entrusting Xiong Shihui to purchase 10,000 shi of rice to be transported to Xun for porridge distribution. Zhou Baipeng has also telegraphed Zhu Qinglan, the director of the relief work group of the Emergency Relief Association, urging him to quickly send 10,000 reed mats to Xun for the refugees to use as bedding. In addition, the Jiujiang Flood Relief Committee decided today to divide the 10,000 yuan remitted by the Shanghai Relief Association specifically for the emergency relief of Jiujiang (originally remitted 20,000 yuan, with 10,000 yuan designated for the emergency relief of Xinjian County) from the 19th, into three groups to distribute it to the 7th, 8th, and 9th districts. Those who are old, weak, disabled, lonely, and helpless will receive 1 yuan, and those who are sick will receive 2 yuan. It is estimated that 3,600 yuan will be distributed in the 9th district, and 3,200 yuan each in the 7th and 8th districts, still under the supervision of Zhou Baipeng.</p>
<p>Yan Zhuang, a member of the National Government Emergency Relief Committee, has brought 130,000 yuan in relief funds to Jiangxi. The amount allocated to each county has been repeatedly discussed in the province. Jiujiang County also sent representatives to attend the meeting to report on the disaster situation. It is reported that it has been decided to allocate the funds to 23 counties, with the first-class disaster areas receiving 10,000 yuan. Jiujiang has been listed as a first-class disaster area because its disaster situation is very serious (September 17th).</p>
<h3>Han Fuqu Returns to the Province After Inspection</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Provincial Governor Han Fuqu went to Jiaodong for inspection this time. On the evening of the 15th, he went to Gaomi from Weixian. Before leaving, he learned that the bandits in the Zuoshan Station and Huangqibu area of the Jiaoji Railway were rampant, taking advantage of the fact that the Yun Qichang brigade stationed there was transferred south to Linyi. He specifically telegraphed the first battalion of Lei Taiping's pistol brigade stationed in Jinan and the Chuan Guozhen regiment of Qiao Lizhi's 74th Division to suppress the bandits in the Huangqibu area. The Jiaoji Railway is preparing three trains for transportation. The first train of the Fu regiment has already departed from Jidong, and the remaining troops will be sent successively. Lei Taiping has decided to lead his troops in person. Han himself went to Jiaoxian from Gaomi this morning to give a speech to the Yun Qichang brigade and inspect everything. At 3:24 pm, he returned west by special train from Jiaoxian and stopped in Gaomi in the evening. He is expected to arrive in the province tomorrow (September 16th).</p>
<h3>Red Bandits in Western Fujian Surrender After Being Surrounded</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: After Deng Yingchao and Xiao Jingxuan succeeded Zhang Dingchen and Lin Yizhu as commanders of the Red Bandits in Western Fujian, internal conflicts arose. On September 5th, the military and civilians of Western Fujian launched a large-scale joint encirclement and suppression. Zhang Zhen's division and Wang Zuqing's brigade advanced from Yongding Hexi towards the eastern part of Shanghang. Yang Chunchun's brigade's two regiments also advanced towards Shanghang from Hugang. Zhong Shaokui led the armed village self-defense corps and departed from Shanghang City. Luo Jieren led the Tinghang Lianyong security team and advanced north from Hangfeng City. Fu Bocui led the Yanhang Lianyong security team and advanced southwest from Shanghang Jiaoyang. Zhong Wencai's bandit suppression army's third detachment blocked the border between Shanghang and Wuping. Lu Xinming's bandit suppression army blocked the border between Shanghang and Changting. Five days later, Wang's brigade arrived at Lanjia渡 ferry, Yang's brigade reached Dayang坝 dam, Zhong Shaokui's troops reached Baisha, Luo Jieren's troops reached Lufeng, and Fu Bocui's troops reached Fengnian Bridge. As a result, the communists under Deng and Xiao were surrounded on all sides in Hongqiaotou. One-third of the Red Army troops were from Shanghang, many of whom were Fu Bocui's old troops. On the 8th, they fought with Zhong Shaokui's troops in the Baisha area. The Red Bandits were defeated, and their morale was gradually collapsing. At that time, the so-called worker-peasant armed elements suddenly changed their minds and turned their guns on the Peng Yang pseudo-military school students. After hours of fierce fighting, each detachment retreated. The worker-peasant elements went to Fengnian Bridge and surrendered to Fu Bocui's troops, intending to return to their original homes in Jiaoyang and return to farming. The Red Bandits' power is weakening, and the chaos in Western Fujian can be quelled within ten days (September 13th).</p>

<p>Wuxi Correspondence: January 1, 1931, was the date for abolishing Likin, and April 1 was the date for starting to collect business tax. At that time, chambers of commerce in various counties of Jiangsu Province had doubts about the tax rate and requested an explanation from the province, as well as further requests for exemption or postponement. After a long stalemate, there was a request to lower the tax rate, and the business circles achieved a small victory. In April, business tax bureaus were established in various counties of Jiangsu Province, and declaration forms were sent to the chambers of commerce, which forwarded them to the trade associations for completion. For industries not in the chambers of commerce, the bureaus directly sent personnel to investigate or entrusted the public security sub-bureaus to investigate nearby. By May, most investigations had been completed, and business investigation registration certificates were issued. In July, tax collection began. Those who were members of the chambers of commerce submitted their taxes through the chambers of commerce, and those who were not members were collected directly by the bureaus. However, the commencement date of business tax collection in various counties has now become an issue. The province stated that it should be collected from April 1, and the tax should be considered for the summer. However, the business circles said that the investigation and completion of the declaration form was after June, so it should naturally be considered for the autumn commencement from July. The officials and businesses are in a stalemate, and there has been no resolution. The business tax bureaus in various counties are eager to remit the funds due to the provincial government's urgent demands for payment. They have adopted a flexible approach, not specifying the season of the tax on the receipts when collecting the tax for the first time, leaving room for future adjustments. Recently, the local business tax bureaus received instructions from the provincial departments, ordering them to close the summer business tax and prepare to collect the autumn tax. After receiving the order, the business tax bureaus immediately forwarded a letter to the chambers of commerce for their information. The Wuxi Chamber of Commerce, after receiving the official letter from Director Wang Zhongqing, believed that the matter was of great importance and specifically wrote to the Business Tax Bureau, stating the dilapidated state of commerce and requesting that it be forwarded to the provincial departments for permission to commence collection from the autumn. After receiving the letter, Director Wang immediately forwarded it to the provincial departments for instructions. At the same time, the Wuxi Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce, requesting that it unite with the chambers of commerce in various counties to request the provincial departments to approve the commencement of collection from the autumn. After sending this telegram, there has been no reply from the provincial departments. It is not yet possible to predict whether this matter will achieve its goal.</p>
<h3>Measures for Repaying Local Military Advances</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce previously stated that there were no clear regulations on the method of repaying all the advances borrowed by the troops when they passed through the area and specifically requested the National Government for instructions. Now, the Ministry of Military Affairs has drafted measures and submitted them to the Executive Yuan, which forwarded them to the Zhejiang Provincial Government for its information. After receiving the order, the provincial government instructed the provincial security office to forward the order to the various regiments of the security team yesterday for them to comply with. The text of the Executive Yuan's order is as follows: "The National Government has transferred to the Yuan a case from the Zhejiang Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce requesting that clear regulations be established for the repayment of all advances borrowed by the troops when they pass through the area to relieve the people's difficulties, etc. The Yuan instructed the Ministry of Military Affairs to review and reply. Now, it has been replied that the headquarters of the quartermaster department has approved and replied that all troops sent to suppress bandits are issued bandit suppression expenses in accordance with regulations, and the transportation and support are handled by the station. There is no need for local supplies. If there is a request to local units to hire boats, carts, and horses, purchase food and materials, etc., the requesting troops should pay the price. However, to facilitate marching and avoid delaying military operations, it is unavoidable for troops to borrow from the local area temporarily. In all these circumstances, the troops should pay themselves to clear the procedure. If the borrowing chambers of commerce cannot recover the funds, they should submit the existing receipts of the troops to the headquarters and request that they be deducted from the troops' expenses to help the merchants in difficulty. Is this appropriate? We are submitting a written document to the Yuan for review and approval. The proposed measures are appropriate and should be approved and implemented. In addition to instructing the Ministry to circulate the order to all troops for compliance and submitting a report, the Provincial Government should also immediately instruct its subordinates to be informed."</p>
<h3>The Third International and Soviet Russia's Conspiracy (Continued from the Ninth)</h3>
<p>Asder: We have repeatedly mentioned the outbreak of strikes, especially concerning silk factories. Even you had early suspicions about this. Why did the outcome turn out so badly? We repeatedly urged the comrades to make adequate preparations and instructed the Party to find ways to contact the silk factories. However, after the strike, it has become clear that we have not made any progress since January of this year.</p>
<p>Golu Ping: In terms of organization, we have also had some success, but not in the silk factories. Recently, we have newly established a small group within a certain British electrical company, but it only has two comrades. There are also two comrades in a certain steamship company. We have sent 20 comrades to work in various factories to fight against the right-wing saboteurs, because they have told ordinary workers: "Do not listen to the words of those sent by the Central Committee to carry out labor movements. They tell you to strike and organize, but as soon as danger arises, they will run away, and you will be imprisoned, or even killed." This kind of argument naturally has a great impact on a small number of workers. Therefore, we must send comrades to the factories to work with them. However, most comrades are not willing to endure the hardships of working in factories, so we have to assign comrades who should be disciplined to do it. As of today, the general opinion is that being sent to work in a factory is a kind of punishment. Therefore, every time a comrade is sent, they will repeatedly ask what crime they have committed.</p>
<p>Among telephone workers, we have successfully established three red trade union groups, with more than 20 people. The comrades responsible for the steamship company have organized 70 workers into ten trade union groups. The work we have done among the tram workers in the Public Concession has also been quite successful. The steps we are taking are to first make contact with them, and then secretly gather representatives from various departments to talk. Comrade Geng Futai will be released from prison in a few days. Some workers have organized an association to help him, and have collected funds to support his family. At the same time,</p>

<h3>Summary of Important News</h3>
<p>they also demanded that the factory reinstate him in his job and decided to strike for one day on the day of his release to show their gratitude, which proves that our influence among them is still considerable.</p>
<p>Asder: If this is the case, it is still somewhat satisfactory, but is this plan the automatic initiative of all the workers, or is it limited to the small groups we have?</p>
<p>Golu Ping: This plan is actually the workers' own proposal. We have decided to expand this movement and reorganize this welcome meeting into a May 1st Committee. We are now preparing them for a wage increase struggle, because soon the tram company will increase fares again. In the past, every time the tram company increased fares, the workers' wages would also increase. Their last wage increase was at the beginning of this year. To avoid workers frequently asking for wage increases, we have decided to put forward the following demands: (1) pay housing allowance for workers, (2) free rides on all tram routes in Shanghai, (3) specially made clothes for workers every season, (4) oppose fines, (5) one month's extra salary for one year of work, two months' extra for two years, and so on. The above demands are directly aimed at the company's fare increase, because workers are naturally the first to be affected by fare increases. On the one hand, we will also contact poor communities and the Anti-Imperialist League, and do our best to oppose fare increases, and organize them into a legitimate organization.</p>
<p>Asder: You should still pay attention to the Soviet areas in various parts of China at all times. Do not neglect them because of the tense labor unrest in Shanghai. The other day, Yishamaino told me that the leaflets you distributed to the workers in Shanghai did not mention the Soviet areas in various parts of China at all, which is very regrettable. You said before that you would mobilize a thousand people to participate in the Red Army activities. Why have we not heard anything about it recently?</p>
<p>Ge Ji Xiang: Recently, no representatives from various factories have participated in the Red Army activities. This method was originally based on individual recruitment, and it was not done very well at the beginning. A few dishonest workers did apply, but after receiving travel expenses, they were unwilling to go to the Soviet areas again. Some even avoided meeting us.</p>
<p>Asder: You must conduct a thorough investigation of which factories these cunning workers belong to, and who introduced them, and give them appropriate punishment. How important is the work of participating in the Red Army activities, and yet it has been deceived by ordinary workers? In the future, the responsible comrades should also be thoroughly examined, and a new plan should be formulated. We must know that this kind of work is imperative, and the lifeline of the Red Army and the Soviet areas depends entirely on whether the Party can give them practical assistance. Moreover, after this test, we can get an accurate evaluation of the various organizations in Shanghai based on whether the participation is enthusiastic or not.</p>
<p>Have you had any concrete plans with Babu Nova and Kluer recently? It is a pity that they have not been given any work in these two or three months. They will soon be going to the Soviet area, but before they leave, they should be given appropriate work, and they must be able to leave at any time.</p>
<p>We also hope that you can have a brief report on the preparations for May Day. I have discussed this issue with Slavin and Yishamaino, and we have already had detailed planning. We hope you will report at any time in the future.</p>
<p>(50) Summary of the report submitted by Gannadi of the Pioneer Team, the situation of the red trade union groups. In the eastern district, we have five red groups, three of which were organized this week. In the yarn factories, there are the Xin Shen (transliteration) Yarn Factory, Shanghai First Yarn Factory, Housheng Yarn Factory, Youxin Yarn Factory, and Shenxin, the same name of a yarn factory, Sanxing), etc., all have members scattered among them. The number of people in the five groups is about twenty. They can distribute leaflets separately. These five groups have recently formed a district committee, with one representative selected from each group. Among the dockworkers, we also have seven groups, about ten people in each group. Among the tram workers in the British Concession, there are three groups, also with ten people in each group. We have recently established a factory committee, with five members of the committee, all elected by the workers. The purpose of this committee is to find ways to rescue a worker who was arrested last year (our comrade). They have put forward a request for release and have raised 500 yuan for application. In addition, if there are disputes among the workers, they often resolve them through this committee. In various small iron factories, there are also eighteen people, forming several groups, one of whom works in the iron factory owned by the Shanghai Municipal Council in the Public Concession.</p>
<p>Recent situation of affiliated organizations. At present, we have a total of eighteen people, one of whom works in a tea house in the western district, two are peddlers in the district, and five are peddlers near the arsenal and the French Concession tram company. There is a dormitory in the eastern district, and a peddler and two schools in Zhabei, one of which has about thirty workers.</p>
<p>(58) Resolution on the work report of the national organization, accepted by the Central Committee on May 1, 1931. (1) Since the Central Committee received the report of the organization department on the national organization, it is well known that the Fourth Congress should establish a strong foundation for the actual work after the transformation, but the transformation at this time is the beginning of the work, and there is no significant performance that is satisfactory. For example, the method of fighting for leadership and the work of most party departments still show the regrets of the past, and the speed of the transformation is too slow. The development of party affairs and the establishment of the central group in the industrial area are also lacking in impressive results. The problem of cadres, its unsatisfactory aspects, is the same as before. As for absorbing new cadres, especially labor cadres, there is no result. The organizational situation of the party and the masses in the Soviet area still lack direction. As for the organization of the Soviet area's neighboring areas and the agricultural center areas of the white province, etc., there is no significant strength. From the point of view of organization, we have not yet been able to prove that the workers and peasants can automatically stand in the position of leadership. On important anniversaries, we have no good organization, or even insufficient preparation. On various anniversaries in May, we cannot naturally establish a May Committee, which is even more of an expression of our incompetence. The relationship between the party and mass organizations is still often wrong. Either the party ignores the work of the masses, or the party monopolizes the work of the masses. The actions of managing trade unions often have anarchist tendencies. The relationship between the party and the Youth League shows various opposing tendencies in all aspects. Recently, most organizations have been broken by the enemy. At the same time, the Central Committee firmly believes that many party organs, especially the leading organs, do not understand the true mission of the secret party and the practical content of the work after the transformation. Even a few party departments cannot implement the resolution of the Fourth Congress to reduce the upper-level organs and go deep into the masses.</p>
<p>The above are all "serious and incurable" symptoms, which should be corrected as soon as possible to make the transformation of practical work happen quickly.</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Confessions of the Three Criminals Jin Shunming et al. Fan Guozhong, Captain of the First Water Police Team, arrested notorious bandit Jin Shunming, i.e., Jin Dongquan, in Shanghai on the 10th of this month, and at the same time, he also captured notorious bandits Jin Heshang and Song Xinglin. He seized the hidden weapons, etc. Captain Fan has personally investigated the case. According to Jin Shunming's confession, he worshipped the famous notorious bandit Shen Yongshun, i.e., Shen Ahai, as his teacher. The accomplices all called me the vanguard. After Shen Yongshun was arrested, I planned to combine with the guards in the prison and asked me to transport weapons inside. Because the number of people was not enough, I did not send them in. I still remember when planting seedlings last year, we, twenty or thirty people, went to Fuhuangdai to rob Huang Jieshi's house. After the incident, Shen Yongshun gave me 15 yuan. In August of this year, the original team went to rob Zhu Shutang's house in Maqiao, Lower District, of 150 yuan, and I got 20 yuan. Shen Yongshun asked me to hide a box cannon and a pistol each in a temple near Han Jingdu, and I am willing to hand them over, etc. Captain Fan got the confession, and immediately escorted him to the Yingfu Temple and found them inside the treasure plaque of the Mengjiang Hall, along with twenty-four bullets. Jin Heshang confessed that he helped Jin Shunming rob Zhu Shutang's house in Maqiao Bay and got 11 yuan. Song Xinglin confessed that he robbed Zhang Qiupu's house in Hujiaqiao, Zhabei, of 428 yuan, and I got 47 yuan. Recently, I helped Jin Shunming and others rob Zhu Shutang's house, and I cannot deny the loot. It was also found that the criminal Song Xinglin committed robbery and injured the victim in Fengxian County. On the 16th, the criminals and the seized guns and bullets were escorted to the First District Department of Minhang for verification. Recently, Captain Fan received a report that Gan A Zuo's house in Jingshan Sixth Bao Fifteen Tu hid guns. He sent patrol officer Yao Yuangeng to take the informant to the back of Gan Shen's house and found a box cannon and a pistol in the coffin frame, and then brought Gan Shen back for interrogation.</p>
<p>The Aftermath of the Kidnapping Case in Dazhangjing. After Han Lisheng's seven-year-old son in Tukicun, Dazhangjing Qitu, was kidnapped, the Public Security Bureau immediately ordered Inspector Yang Shijie to lead the entire team of detectives to take a steamship to pursue and rescue him. They went to Yexie, but found no trace of him and returned. Now, the merchants and people there believe that Dazhangjing is an important port of the Pujiang River, and bandits can easily enter, which is a concern. County Magistrate Shen discussed with Cao Tuanchang Pang of the Security Regiment and allowed him to send a company of soldiers to station at Mizidu, the key hub of Huangpu Port, to suppress the bandits.</p>
<h3>Nanhui</h3>
<p>Situation of Disaster Severity in Each District. The disaster situation in each district has been surveyed by the county government. In the first district, the seawall of the third regiment was damaged by more than 230 zhang, and 20,000 mu of newly reclaimed and enclosed reed fields and cotton fields were heavily damaged. The total harvest is about 40% of the normal yield. In addition, the embankment of the fourth regiment's outer dike broke for more than 40 zhang, and about 2,000 mu of newly reclaimed reed fields were flooded. The breach has become bare land, and the harvest is less than 10% of the normal yield. It is proposed to reduce or exempt 30% of the land tax for the entire district. The second district is close to the coast and has outer and inner dikes. This time, the outer dike collapsed, and 1,500 mu of fields inside the outer dike are completely hopeless for harvest. The fields inside the inner dike are fine. It is proposed to reduce 20% of the land tax for the entire district. In the fourth district, the Zaozao Dike of the Sanzhao Second Regiment collapsed for more than 60 zhang, and more than 100 mu of cotton fields were hopeless for harvest. The rest of the areas have been hit by strong winds and heavy rains, and the harvest has also been reduced by 20-30%. It is proposed to reduce 15% of the land tax for the entire district. The fifth district is close to the coast. This time, the tide rose and flooded the area, and the outer dike and Li Gongdi broke in many places, totaling dozens of zhang. More than 3,000 mu of cotton fields were heavily affected, and the harvest was only 20-30% of the normal yield. It is proposed to reduce 25% of the land tax for the entire district. The seventh, eighth, and ninth districts were less affected by the disaster. They can only be regarded as a thin harvest, not a disaster. The second district is adjacent to the two townships of Huangpu Taiping and Jinjing, and the damage is more serious, with a harvest of about 50-60% of the normal yield. It is proposed to reduce 10% of the land tax for the entire district.</p>
<p>The Prank Case Has Been Judged. Mei Kuiru, the main criminal in the prank case, was sentenced to three years and six months of imprisonment by the county government yesterday. It is said that Mei will appeal.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>

<p>The Department of Agriculture Sent Commissioners to Investigate the Disaster Situation in Four Counties. Wuxian's townships have suffered severe flooding this year. The County Government Finance Bureau has jointly dispatched personnel with the County Agricultural Association to form groups to go to the townships to investigate the disaster situation. Now, the Department of Agriculture and Mining has specially appointed Huang Xizhou as a member of the investigation of the disaster situation in the four counties of Changshu, Wujiang, Wuxian, and Kunshan. Huang came to Su yesterday (18th) and will go to the countryside immediately for on-site investigation. After the investigation in this county is completed, he will go to Wujiang for investigation.</p>
<p>Organizing the Joint Defense Office of Eight Counties. After the joint defense office of the four counties of Wu, Kun, Jiang, and Chang was ordered to be abolished, Wu, the county magistrate of Wuxian, believed that since bandit police reports were frequently heard everywhere, neighboring counties should have the necessity of joint defense. Therefore, he initiated the organization of the joint defense office of the eight counties of Wu, Kun, Jiang, Chang, Xi, Yi, and Li, and sent letters to each county to solicit their consent. Yesterday (18th), he received a reply from Wuxi, expressing his agreement. Wujiang Yixing mostly advocated following the majority's decision. After all the counties agree, the first joint defense meeting will be convened to plan the implementation method.</p>

<p>The Autumn Silkworm Guidance Work of the Agricultural Improvement Center is Tense. In order to compensate for the losses of farmers in this flood, the County Agricultural Improvement Center has widely distributed autumn seeds and established 12 guidance stations in this autumn. More than 3,000 silkworm farmers have received guidance. The instructors inspect them separately every day, and the silkworm farmers have formed many joint breeding groups, dividing the work and cooperating, which is progressing smoothly. The early batches of silkworms collected ants on the 24th and 25th of last month, and now they are in the fifth instar and are in full feeding. The late batches collected ants at the end of last month and are now in the third instar and are feeding. The instar period has been quite good, but because the mulberry land has been submerged, the leaves are mostly yellow and old, and the unsubmerged leaves are full of insect pests. Fortunately, the instructors of the center are working tirelessly, running around day and night, and rushing to prevent and control them. At present, there is no major problem.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Tan Bancheng's Ancient Tomb Was Dismantled and Sold. The construction of the county seat was undertaken by the brothers Tan Zhao (zi Ruxi) and Tan Xiao (zi Jingchuan), the great merchants of Dongxiang during the Jiajing period of the Ming Dynasty, who spent their family wealth to build half of the county seat. Therefore, they are known as Tan Bancheng. Later, the Tan brothers died and were buried on the banks of Chengjiaqiao in Xiguo. The tomb was very exquisite, with stone horses and stone sheep and other things built. However, it has been safe for more than 300 years. Unexpectedly, recently a person named Cao Jinfu privately dismantled the tombstone and stone horses and stone sheep and sold them. He also falsely reported to the official property office that it was official wasteland and reported under the pseudonym Shao Yuqing to receive it. Tan Fukang, the nineteenth-generation descendant of the Tan family (currently a county government clerk), heard about it and filed a lawsuit with the county, accusing Cao Jinfu of stealing and selling the ancient tomb. After receiving the report, the county government ordered the First District Office to investigate and reply, confirming the above facts. The county government has first interrogated the plaintiff Tan Fukang and found out the cause of the matter. Now, it will set a date to summon the defendant for further interrogation.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>A Snake Fifteen Feet Long. A large snake was found yesterday in the Jiaoshan Shantang area near Anzhen, Eighth District (Huaixia City). The whole body was gray, the head was as big as a bowl, the body was fifteen feet long, the eyes were bright as electricity, and it weighed about forty kilograms. It has now been captured by Chen Ar, who is a professional snake catcher, in a desolate tomb of a certain family. It was put into the tank. At that time, the audience was overcrowded. According to Chen Ar, one of the snake's eyes is blind, and the selling price in the future can only be reduced by half.</p>
<p>The Bizarre Murder Case at the Station Was Opened for Autopsy. Li Qiannian, a native of Chengdu, Sichuan, was an employee of the Ordnance Depot of the Bengbu Military and Political Department, and has been there for more than a year. On the third of this month, he asked for leave in Bengbu and carried a white leather suitcase, and took a car to Shanghai to study. At half past twelve in the afternoon on the fourth, when the car passed through the Luoshe Station in this county, Li suddenly fell out of the car and died. Afterwards, the Fourth Section of the Railway Police Department sent a letter to the Bengbu Ordnance Depot, saying that Li's head, abdomen, etc. were all injured, and he had been coffined and buried, etc. Ruan Xu (Youwen), the foreman of the department, learned of this, because he was related to Li and was a fellow villager, so he came to Xi on the 7th and went to Luoshe to investigate and got the truth. He returned to Bengbu and came to Xi again on the 15th with the investigator Ning Dingchen and Li's relative Liu Fangchong. Yesterday (18th) at 3 pm, Ruan Xu filed a report with the Procuratorate of the County Court, requesting an autopsy to find out the truth. At the same time, Chen Huiquan, the head of the district, also filed a report with the office. The prosecutor Du opened a court for interrogation and ordered them to be sent back together to wait for the morning car to go to the countryside to open the coffin for autopsy for verification. It is also heard that the deceased Li Qian had 160 yuan in paper money, a silver watch, a woolen coat in the suitcase, a blue serge coat, and more than ten other clothes. Now they are all missing. The death is bizarre. After the autopsy is opened, all the necessary items have been prepared and are planned to be transported to Bengbu and then transferred to Sichuan for burial.</p>
<p>The Construction Bureau Widens the Streets at the Foot of the West City. The County Government Construction Bureau of this county believes that the foot of the city outside the West Gate is the throat of the northwest traffic. Only the streets are narrow, the road surface is out of repair, the traffic is congested, and the danger is worrying. It has now been decided to widen the narrowest street from the North Water Gate to Yan Lane to four feet (13 feet 2 inches in the British system) at a time. The calculation standard is from the outer foot of the city wall to the stone foot of the house. Various projects such as paving the road will be carried out one after another to achieve a permanent solution. All houses located in the section with a width of less than 4 meters (Chinese "gongchi") must be demolished and vacated voluntarily before October 20 of this year. If the demolition and vacating are not implemented after the deadline, the Municipal Engineering Office will hire workers to enforce them. For those whose original width has exceeded the prescribed 4 meters, they should still maintain their original state and are not allowed to occupy it. A special joint notice was issued yesterday.</p>
<p>The Public Debt Was Received with Profits, But the Work Has Not Yet Started. The Yinyi Silk Factory in Lihua Village outside the North Gate is operated by Gao Keming, a local of the county. However, due to the slump in the silk market in recent years, the factory has stopped work. The Zhuangjia who usually deal with him is Yuanchang Zhuang in Beitang. Qian Yongqing, the manager of the Zhuang, has been asking Gao for arrears since Yinyi stopped work. Gao has been perfunctorily replying with no money in hand. Now that the silk industry public debt has been issued, Gao and Qian went to Shanghai to receive it. They received a public debt of 20,480 yuan. After returning to Xi, they still deposited the money into Yuanchang Zhuang and credited it to Yinyi's account. Gao Keming prepared to resume work and notified the factory's employees to go to the factory to work. More than 200 workers heard the news of the resumption of work and prepared to go to work. Unexpectedly, it was still not resumed until yesterday, so they went to the factory to question him. The factory explained that the money received had been deducted by Yuanchang Zhuang. The workers heard this and turned to the Trade Union and requested them to come forward for negotiation. Subsequently, the standing committee of the Silk Factory Federation, Hui Jizhi, invited Gao Keming, the manager of Yinyi Silk Factory, to visit Chen, the county magistrate, in the County Government, and reported the reason for the failure to resume work in person. Chen, the county magistrate, immediately sent police officers to summon Qian Yongqing, the manager of Yuanchang, to the county and ordered him to return the money, and limited Gao Keming to resume work within seven days to maintain the livelihoods of the workers.</p>

Upon receiving the report, the High Court specially sent Commissioner Shi Zechen to Chang on the 17th to investigate the truth of the case. Commissioner Shi first met with County Magistrate Zhang, then went to the County Court, and then went to the local prison to interrogate Chen Mazi's fellow prisoners.</p>
<p>The Newly Appointed Director of Education Will Take Office. Pan Jingrang, the Director of the Education Bureau of Wu Yi, requested to resign. The Department of Education has approved the appointment of Yang Haoming, the County Supervisor, to act as his agent. After receiving the appointment, Yang went to the province on the 17th to ask for instructions on everything. After returning to Chang, he will take over.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>The Provincial Public Security Reinvestigates the Case of Shooting the Captain. Yang Jincheng, the captain of the detective team of the Provincial Public Security Team, came to Yang on the 16th with detective Gu Gaolin to investigate the major case of shooting Ma Qian, the captain of the team, for refusing to arrest him. They summoned and interrogated Jiang Rong and Wu Zhenghai, the local guards outside the South Gate. According to the confession, detective Hu Keyin arrested Dai Xiaoerzi on August 12 and escorted him to the Public Security Bureau. He was released on bail by Wu Zhenghai after interrogation. On the 17th, Jiang Bao and Wu Zhenghai were taken across the river for verification.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Yizhen Association Sent Commissioners to Cheng to Survey the Disaster. Wang Yiting et al., the chairman of the Jiangsu Flood Relief Yizhen Association, received a telegram from Cao Yuanmo, the director of the Jiangyin Relief Home, and Zhu Danxiang, the representative of the township, stating that the water disaster in various townships along the canal in Shazhou was very serious and requesting the allocation of relief funds. Chairman Wang then sent secretary Wu Zhigang (a native of Xiagang, Jiangyi) to Cheng on the 16th. On the 17th, he met with County Magistrate Peng in the County Government and contacted Cao and Zhu, requesting them to send personnel to the disaster area of Shazhou to investigate the actual situation. Today (18th), Secretary Wu and the district chief of the district went to Sha to investigate. Because there were more than 40 breached dikes, they planned to divide the work into emergency relief, winter relief, and construction relief, so that they could report back to the association and then decide on a plan.</p>
<p>Impersonating Military Recruiters Was Sentenced to Imprisonment. Last month, the Changshou Guard Corps of the Ninth District arrested Jin Biao, a native of Dantu, who impersonated a recruiting member of the Constitutional Police Office and extorted money in the countryside.

Jin Biao was sentenced to six months of imprisonment, Lu Yunzhang and Yu Yinting were each sentenced to four months of imprisonment, and Kong Fanhua, Wang Zhengrong, Yu Deshan, and Jiang Deyu were each sentenced to three months of imprisonment.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>The Trend of Salary Demands in the Education Sector: In this county, the education sector is currently facing difficulties in maintaining livelihoods because salaries have only been paid up to the first half of February, coupled with the recent floods. Therefore, a large-scale salary demand was held the other day. After a resolution by the entire body, a request was first submitted to the county government to audit the accounts of the education land tax managed by the Finance Bureau. On the morning of the 12th, the county government approved the request, ordering the Education Bureau and the Finance Bureau to conduct the audit. The entire education sector then went to the Education Bureau at 12:00 noon to meet Director Yang, demanding a quick settlement of accounts. Director Yang replied that the accounts for the recent months of July and August were the responsibility of Section Chief Zhong. The education sector then sent ten representatives, including You Lucheng, to Zhong's private residence, requesting him to go to the Finance Bureau for discussions. However, Zhong immediately said that they were not qualified to talk to him. While they were at an impasse, a messenger from County Magistrate Wang arrived, ordering Zhong to go to the magistrate. Zhong could not refuse and went with the crowd. However, when they arrived at the county government's auditorium, Zhong wanted to go to the county government, but the education sector representatives requested him to go to the Finance Bureau first. Unexpectedly, Zhong's male servant shouted that there were bandits and blew a police whistle. At this moment, the police from the Western Hill were about to open fire, but Police Captain Zhang Peifu arrived and, knowing that it was a salary demand by the education sector, ordered them not to fire. The education sector representatives argued that if a bloody tragedy occurred due to the false report of bandits, who would be responsible? Upon arriving at the Finance Bureau, they announced the situation to the public and negotiated with Zhong. Zhong then knelt on the ground to apologize and the matter was settled. At this time, County Magistrate Wang also arrived at the Finance Bureau and ordered Zhong and Fei Shibao, the acting director of the Education Bureau, to go to the county government to settle the accounts. Gao Fusun was also sent by the education sector to supervise the process. As a result, only the accounts from July 27th to August 25th of this year were handed over. After auditing, it was found that the education sector was allocated 1,300 yuan. The remaining accounts were promised to be handed over on the 18th of this month. The funds allocated to the education sector were to be covered by a check from Zhong issued by Heng Yu Zhuang, temporarily stored by tax collector Huang Genshen. On the morning of the 13th, the entire education sector gathered again at the County No. 1 Elementary School. Tax collector Huang, together with education sector representative Gao Fusun, went to Heng Yu Zhuang to cash the check. Unexpectedly, Heng Yu Zhuang refused to pay. Huang and Gao then went to the Finance Bureau to negotiate with Zhong. Zhong then went to the county government to ask County Magistrate Wang to find a solution. The entire education sector endured hunger from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM. Since there was still no response, they went to the county government and saw Zhong, Huang, and Gao discussing with County Magistrate Wang, but there was still no solution. They returned to the Finance Bureau and stayed there with Zhong overnight. It was not until 8:00 PM that Zhong requested to go out to raise funds. Huang and Gao accompanied him. They returned at 10:30 PM with only 250 yuan, which was handed over to acting director Fei Shibao for safekeeping. Zhong promised to collect the remaining 1,050 yuan by the evening of the 14th, and the group dispersed. At 3:00 PM on the 14th, the principals of various schools, leaders of social education institutions, and education committee members from various districts held a special meeting at the County Library, with 19 people in attendance, to discuss important matters: (1) How to continue urging the Finance Bureau to allocate the promised 1,300 yuan. It was resolved that acting director Fei and the tax collector, along with the previous four representatives, should seriously negotiate with the Finance Bureau. (2) How to settle the various funds collected by the Finance Bureau on behalf of the education sector. It was resolved that acting director Fei should follow the county magistrate's order and promptly settle the accounts at the Finance Bureau, and that the responsible personnel of various educational institutions and the four representatives previously selected should be present to supervise. Before the supervision of the accounting, the acting director should notify all supervisors.</p>
<h3>Pinghu</h3>
<p>French Catholic Priests Secretly Encroach on Zha Mountain Land: Hu Tianshun, a farmer from Changshan Village, Zhapu, secretly sold four "lou" of mountain land on the southern slope of Poshan Mountain to the French Catholic Church. Later, when Tianshun went up the mountain to cut trees, the Catholic Church came out to stop him and summoned bailiffs to negotiate with Hu. Hu's clan members learned of this situation and questioned Tianshun. However, Hu Tianshun claimed that he had only mortgaged the land to Wang Guihe, a Catholic parishioner, and had not signed any documents of abandonment. The two sides remained deadlocked. Yesterday, Zhu Xiulin from the church filed a complaint with the Zhapu Public Security Bureau, requesting Hu's arrest for legal resolution.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Reduction of Education Funds Causes Panic Among Teachers: Yesterday, the Yinxian County government's county administration meeting decided to reduce the education funds for the 20th year by a certain percentage due to financial constraints. The salaries of all primary and secondary school teachers in the old urban area would be discounted by 84%. Upon hearing this news, the primary and secondary school teachers in the old urban area were panic-stricken. All 274 teachers in the district jointly declared, requesting all sectors to uphold justice and provide assistance. They also sent representatives Zhang Bocheng, Ye Zihan, and others to petition the Party headquarters and sent representatives to the provincial capital to petition, determined to overturn the decision to reduce salaries.</p>
<p>Police Officer Convicted of Extortion for Twelve Years: Xu Guoliang, a police officer from the Mazhu Public Security Bureau, colluded with gangsters Zhang Yaochu, Lao Afu, and others in February of this year to extort a large sum of money from Yang Xiuzhang, the manager of the Yang Tongyu dried goods store in Houyan Town, Mazhu, by sending letters with bullets. After Yang reported the case to the authorities for investigation, Xu Guoliang and the other two were arrested and sent to the Yuyao County Court for investigation. As a result, they were prosecuted and each sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment. Later, because Xu and the others did not accept the original verdict, they appealed to the High Court. It is now known that the High Court has upheld the original verdict and Xu and his accomplices will still serve twelve years of imprisonment.</p>
<p>Shi A'si Kidnapped: Shi A'si, the owner of Shi Yuchang Rice Store in Dudong Village, Cibei, was suddenly visited by more than ten bandits at around 9:00 PM last night. They broke into the house, kidnapped A'si, and fled into the sea from the Guanhaizhou area, leaving behind a letter demanding a ransom of 80,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>Town Chamber of Commerce Charged by Two Counties: Linpu is an area jointly administered by Shaoxing and Xiaoshan counties. All kinds of administrative agencies are set up in both places, but the Chamber of Commerce is a joint organization of the two counties and there is only one. Therefore, this time, when Shaoxing and Xiaoshan counties were ordered to raise public bonds to clear old debts in the 20th year, the amount of public bonds to be raised by the Chamber of Commerce was determined to be 30,000 yuan in Shaoxing and 9,000 yuan in Xiaoshan. It is now known that the Chamber of Commerce has been charged with debts by both counties, amounting to as much as 39,000 yuan, which is difficult to raise. Merchants in the Xiaoshan area believe that since the debts charged by the two counties are different, they should be allocated according to the boundaries of the land.</p>
<p>Letter Received</p>
<h3>Letter from the Gaoyou County Flood Relief Temporary Association</h3>
<p>To the Editor: We recently read in your newspaper's Gaoyou News column on the 13th that 23 refugees outside the South Gate took a ferry to Xiaohexi to board a refugee ship to find food in the south. Due to the small size of the boat and the large number of people, it was overturned by the wind and waves in the center of the canal, resulting in the drowning of eight people, etc. After careful investigation by our association, it was found that on the evening of August 28th, a small boat carrying nine people was discovered. When crossing the river and reaching the center, the boat capsized due to the strong current. Fortunately, the Fu Yun Yu Tai steamboat came to the rescue and rescued six people. The other three swam ashore. No one drowned. The Public Security Bureau has now banned small boats from crossing the river at night. This is the real situation that day. It is likely that the report was based on rumors and does not match the facts. We hereby request a correction. Gaoyou County Flood Relief Temporary Association Rescue Team, September 15th.</p>

<p>Liangjiang Wins the Women's Basketball Championship</p>
<h3>37-18 Victory Over Southeast丨Southeast's Performance Was Also Very Commendable</h3>
<p>A total of three teams participated in this city's women's basketball competition: Liangjiang, Southeast, and Jinan. They competed in a triangular pattern, using a single round-robin to determine the winners. Liangjiang first defeated Jinan 22-9, and then defeated Southeast 37-18 yesterday. In two consecutive matches, they leveled the playing field and won the Shanghai Women's Basketball Championship. This is a grand event and must be recorded.</p>
<h3>丨Progress of the Competition丨</h3>
<p>First Match: Jinan vs. Southeast, 18-31, Southeast Wins</p>
<p>Second Match: Liangjiang vs. Jinan, 22-9, Liangjiang Wins</p>
<p>Third Match: Southeast vs. Liangjiang, 18-37, Liangjiang Wins</p>
<p>Conclusion: Liangjiang Wins Twice, Southeast Wins Once, Jinan Loses All</p>
<h3>丨Truth of the Battle丨</h3>
<p>City Tiger and Cup Snake: In the sound of the silver whistle, the battle slowly unfolded. Liangjiang's center, Long Jingxiong, stood out, getting the first rebound. Shao Jinying and Yang Eren then returned to Long's center, but their shots missed. Yang continued, still unsuccessful. The ball turned direction, and Southeast also missed. Liangjiang's Wang Lan committed a foul, and Pan Yueying missed the opportunity. Two minutes passed like this. In a flash, Yang Ren lightly knocked on the door, and Shao Jinqiang snatched the fort. Two whistles sounded, indicating a hit. Southeast declared a truce to strategize and try to turn the tide. A ball flew in, and Pan Yueying pushed the boat along the river, hitting the basket, which was very beautiful. Southeast then opened the record with two points. Liangjiang's lineup changed suddenly, with the forwards appearing and disappearing unpredictably, and the guards unable to enter. The Southeast fighters lost their color and were panicked. City Tiger and Cup Snake, all the vegetation was soldiers, and the guard failed, and the ball basket was repeatedly harmed. The score in the first quarter was 26 to 3, with Southeast lagging behind.</p>
<p>Spirits Aroused: After this dramatic creation, Southeast's victory was hopeless. The spirit of the warriors, on the contrary, appeared aroused. In the beginning, the guards were positioned too far forward, giving the enemy opportunities to invade. Now they stood behind them, closely following. This plan was effective, and the forwards also rose up, making a posture of confrontation. However, the Liangjiang long-term battle division, the offense and defense were superhuman. No matter how strong your golden city and iron wall, those who first defeated the strong players were still Liangjiang's Shao Jinying and Yang Ren. Southeast's Dou Wende came up with a plan, and two times secretly crossed Chen Cang, and they all reported victory. It is also gratifying that Dou can continue to hit from the hands of strong enemies. Then Shao Jinying was seen hitting a ball from the Tianluodi net, and Pan Yuemo even hit two free throws in a row. Before the sound of the truce whistle, Shao once again showed his skills, adding two more points. In this section, the two sides were extremely close, and Liangjiang won two more points, which was very difficult. The score was eight to six. In the first half, Liangjiang had 26 points and Southeast had nine points.</p>
<p>Work and Strength Appropriate: The performance of Southeast gradually became better. Until the third quarter, Pan Yueying led the outside, and Jiang Huaixuan steered the inside, assisting left and right, and all of them rose up. Liangjiang only had great skills, and it was difficult to be as comfortable as in the first quarter. Southeast's Pan Yueying's hit increased her sharpness, and after that, the whole situation saw the skill of the guards on both sides, snatching left and right, blocking front and back, and you came and I went, each with its own ingenuity. The scores on both sides were Liangjiang Shao Jinying's free throw of one point, Long 竸xiong three points, and Southeast Pan Yueying added another point. The result of this section was four to three, with Liangjiang winning one point.</p>
<p>Although Defeated, Still Honorable: Once an ordinary team loses the wind, it presents a sign of disintegration and becomes irreversible. Women are especially prone to this disease. However, Southeast alone corrects this defect. In the second and second sections, it confronted each other, winning the sympathy of the audience. The more it worked hard in the fourth section, the more it showed its spirit. In fact, in terms of theory, Southeast's talent is not as good as Liangjiang's. However, Southeast is the only one who can follow Liangjiang and have the ambition to replace it. Southeast's defeat yesterday was inevitable due to the situation. The difference was too great, and the blame was on the first quarter's panic and gaffe. In the last quarter, Liangjiang frequently invaded the enemy's fort, and its momentum was unstoppable. Southeast worked hard and gave the last whip. The score was tense, no less than the above two sections. In the fourth quarter, it was seven to six, with Liangjiang only one point more. In the second half, Liangjiang had 11 points and Southeast had nine points. The total result was 37 to 18, with Liangjiang winning.</p>

<p>Baseball Second Act Jiangwan Wins with Determination</p>
<h3>丨Six to Two丨</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the second act of the baseball triangular cycle competition. The participants were Jiangwan (Fudan) against Liyi. After a fierce battle of seven innings, Jiangwan won because of its average talent, while Liyi failed because of its uneven technical strengths and weaknesses. It was found that Liyi had defeated John the day before, but lost to Jiangwan yesterday. If Jiangwan can defeat John again today, it will win this year's baseball championship. Judging from the competition situation in the past two days, Jiangwan seems to have a sure chance of winning, but things often exceed expectations, such as the defeat of Haixing volleyball to Wuben, and the victory of Sun Chengbi and Wang Minshi's tennis doubles over Qian Yaobin and Tu Kaiyuan, all of which exceeded the expectations of most people. The reporter is ignorant and dare not make a definite judgment. If you want to know what to do, just wait for today's game to be clear.</p>
<p>Nothing Gained in the First Two Innings: At the beginning of the first inning, Liyi took the lead in attacking. Among the five people who were connected to the ball, Zhang Zhao and Li Wenxuan each got a hit. Wei Zongtang also got four balls and entered first base, but Li Ziji and Huang Qishu were both out of first base. Wei Tangtang was also killed at second base because he was too late to run. Therefore, Liyi did not gain anything in the first inning. When Jiangwan attacked, Feng Zhaoyuan and Jin Zhendong were out one after another. Zeng Bangguang relied on the enemy team's shortstop error to advance to first base, but when An Lesheng got a hit, he risked charging and was out at third base, which also resulted in empty hands. In the second inning, the battle was even more enjoyable. Four people from Liyi moved and three continued to be out in a moment. Jiangwan was also the same.</p>
<p>Getting a Hit Jiangwan Shows Its Power: At the beginning of the third inning, Liyi suddenly showed a downturn, and everything was in adversity. When Jiangwan attacked, Gu Degang was the backbone of the Jiangwan team, but he did not reach first base and the referee had ordered him out. When Feng Zhaoyuan hit the ball, Ren Jiexing was also disqualified for stealing the base. When the public thought there was no hope, who would have thought that there would be a new situation. Feng Zhaoyuan and Jin Zhendong were able to advance to first and second base because of the enemy's errors. Zeng Guangbang was also heard to have gotten a hit. So, Feng Zhaoyuan ran back to home base first and opened the record. The follower of Feng was Jin Zhendong. When Liang Yaohua hit the ball, there were people at all three bases. The tension in the air at this time was one of the most exciting scenes of yesterday's game. Unfortunately, Liang Jun hit too high and was intercepted in the air by the enemy's first baseman, ending the third inning.</p>
<p>Three At-Bats Lesheng Shows His Power: In the fourth inning, Jiangwan pitcher An Lesheng showed his power, causing Li Xuan to be out at first base. When Huang Qishu and Chen Guangrong attacked, he got two "three at-bats" in a row. The Liangjiang team that won the women's basketball championship (taken by this museum) made Liyi unable to grasp the momentum for a while, so when they counterattacked, An Ousheng and Gu Degang got two more "hits" and also got the help of the rear, and were able to run back to home base, making a ratio of four singles to zero.</p>
<p>Two-Base Hit Liyi Returns the Color: Liyi suffered a heavy blow and tried to recover. After Lin Wencheng and Chen Guisen were out one after another, Gao Yongxin was able to advance to first base due to the enemy's first baseman's mistake, and stole second base. Then, relying on Zhang Zhaoyuan's two-base hit, he returned the color and also ran back one point. Unfortunately, the good news had just arrived, and the bad news came again. Jiangwan Li Yaohua also got a three-base hit and Zhou Chongdao ran in for another point. Then, Li Zhaohua rushed in for another point due to the enemy's second baseman's error. Or it can be said that the loss outweighs the gain.</p>
<p>Difficult to Recover Liyi Scores Again: At the beginning of the sixth inning, Liyi's momentum was overwhelming. Zhang Zhaoyuan hit a hit, and Li Ziji continued with another one. At this time, all the Jiangwan team members were terrified. In the mixed situation, Zhang Zhaosheng ran back to home base. Looking back at third base, there were people on all three bases. If Liyi could get a three-base hit or a home run at this critical moment, Jiangwan's victory would be in danger because of it. Who would have thought that it would be a flash in the pan. Chen Guangrong hit a high ball, which was caught in the air by Anle, and passed to third base, then passed to second base, killing three people in a row. As a result, Liyi had no achievements in the seventh inning, and Jiangwan won by six to two.</p>

<p>Hujiang seized the first opportunity. Feng Nianhua failed to make the free throw after Gu Guangdao's foul. Lu Zhongen then shot a free throw against Xia Zeren. As the game started, both teams were fiercely competitive, displaying their skills. Qian Dingshen dodged Lu Zhongen with a spin and charged straight along the sideline under the basket, scoring in one go. Feng Nianhua then shot a free throw, and Hujiang scored another point. The two teams advanced and retreated, with beautiful passes moving at lightning speed. The entire court was like a storm sweeping in, unstoppable. Kong Guangyi scored three consecutive points, and Qian Dingshen added another basket. Qian Fu tripped near the basket and scored two more points on free throws. Chih Chih then took a significant lead with a score of 9 to 3. Hujiang called a timeout, and the situation eased slightly.</p>
<h3>Poor Luck Leads to a Loss of Accuracy</h3>
<p>With Hujiang's strategy set, Chih Chih also planned their attack. Xia Zeren advanced from the rear, and Gu Guangdao scored a long shot. Kong Guangyi then broke through the basket, bringing the score to 15 to 5 and then 17 to 7, widening the gap further. Hujiang's three forwards missed more than ten shots, lacking accuracy. Those who were usually accurate last night were at a loss. With the situation favorable, Chih Chih relaxed, and Li Ruchun scored five consecutive points, and Qian Jingyong made two shots out of two, bringing Hujiang behind by five points at halftime, 21 to 16.</p>
<h3>Breaking Through Heavy Defenses: A Golden Cicada Sheds Its Shell</h3>
<p>Starting in the second half, Hujiang adopted a strict defensive policy, increasing their defense. They closely marked each opponent, keeping Chih Chih lingering in their own backcourt, unable to get close to the basket. Qian Dingshen took the opportunity to quickly pass to Kong. Everyone rushed towards Kong. In that instant, like a golden cicada shedding its shell, Qian dodged Lu Zhongen and went straight to the basket. Kong waved his hand, and Qian quickly tossed the ball into the net, a marvel to behold.</p>
<h3>A Key Player Fouled Out: Tension Emerges</h3>
<p>Although Chih Chih was winning in this section, leading by twelve points at 35 to 23, their key defender Xia Zeren had been fouled out after four fouls, greatly shaking their defense. Lu Zhongen then seized the opportunity to advance rapidly, attacking and charging fiercely, scoring six consecutive points with long and short shots. Li Ruchun added another two points, leaving Hujiang only four points behind. There were still seven minutes left.</p>
<h3>A Hair's Breadth Away: A Missed Opportunity</h3>
<p>Chih Chih called a timeout, trying to maintain their composure. Kong Guangyi commanded the team, calmly and methodically, scoring another two points. Hujiang also added two players to catch up. At a critical moment, Lu Zhongen rushed to the basket and shot, but missed by a hair's breadth. With this opportunity lost, the overall momentum flowed away like water. Chih Chih went straight up, eventually winning by nine points at 43 to 34.</p>
<h3>Heroes' Successes and Failures Each Have Their Reasons</h3>
<p>Heroes should not be judged solely by success or failure. Let's discuss the reasons for their victories and defeats. Chih Chih's victory was due to their speed. Accurate shooting was a major factor in their win. The entire team functioned as a complete machine, advancing and retreating together at the same pace. Kong Guangyi's strength and stability, unyielding, capable of both offense and defense, deservedly earned him the title of King of the Court. Hujiang had three times as many shooting opportunities as Chih Chih, but the difference in accuracy was due to both poor luck and the strong opponents in front of them, leading to a significant loss of control and a lack of experience. The uneven pace between the front and back lines meant that the forwards went far ahead while the defenders were still lagging behind, giving the opponents ample time to prepare. Wang Xiliang's passes and the forwards' scoring were commendable, but his inaccurate shots also resulted in lost points.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government employees' health exercises began yesterday at 1:30 p.m. The team members arrived on time, dressed in their uniforms, in excellent spirits. Observing the matches, the members showed a foundation, but limited by their duties, they lacked practice and easily became fatigued. The results are recorded below:</p>
<h3>City Public Works Bureau Volleyball Team (Photo by Li Guang)</h3>
<p>(1) Volleyball Finals</p>
<p>Public Works Bureau defeats Social Affairs Bureau　2 to 1</p>
<p>Looking at the players of both teams, their strengths were equal. The Social Affairs Bureau had a well-rounded team with no outstanding players. Huang Yuanguang and Cai Jiying of the Public Works Bureau were strong players, while the rest were slightly inferior. In the first set, the Social Affairs Bureau received and countered well, steadily pressing and taking the lead with 21 to 17. In the second set, Huang Yuanguang and Cai Jiying of the Public Works Bureau served accurately and quickly, like falling meteors, and the Social Affairs Bureau could hardly defend, losing badly with 7 to 21. The third set became the decisive moment for victory. Both sides were extremely motivated, advancing point by point, not giving way to each other. The back row guided and lifted, the middle row pushed up, and the front line jumped and attacked, each exerting their best efforts. As a result, the Public Works Bureau won another set with 22 to 20 and celebrated their victory.</p>

<p>(2) Football Preliminary Games</p>
<p>(1) Education Bureau defeats Health Bureau　　3 to 0</p>
<p>(2) Public Security Bureau defeats Public Utilities Bureau　　2 to 1</p>
<p>(3) Land Bureau defeats Public Works Bureau　　3 to 0</p>
<p>In the match between the Education Bureau and the Health Bureau, the forces were evenly matched at the beginning. Afterwards, the Education Bureau gradually became stronger, especially the right winger Yang Peiwen, whose footwork was accurate and made many contributions. The score was 2-0 in the first half and 1-0 in the second half. The match between the Public Security Bureau and the Public Utilities Bureau was more energetic than the previous match, with no shortage of veterans on both sides. In the first half, the Public Security Bureau's forwards charged fiercely and scored a goal, but the Public Utilities Bureau quickly retaliated with a goal. The second half remained evenly matched. Just when the audience thought it would be impossible to determine the winner, the Public Utilities Bureau's inner defender carelessly touched the ball and was penalized with a penalty kick, resulting in an extra loss, which was truly unfortunate. In the match between the Land Bureau and the Public Works Bureau, the teams fought fiercely in the first half, and neither side scored, proving them to be evenly matched. At the beginning of the second half, the standoff continued. Suddenly, the Land Bureau launched a surprise attack and scored a goal. Once the score was opened, they went with the flow and quickly scored two more goals. The Public Works Bureau had almost no resistance. This was not due to a significant difference in strength, but rather a shift in morale.</p>
<p>(3) Basketball Preliminary Games</p>
<p>(1) Municipal Government defeats Land Bureau　45 to 21</p>
<p>(2) Social Affairs Bureau defeats Health Bureau　59 to 19</p>
<p>The skills of the four teams were quite impressive, with the Municipal Government and the Social Affairs Bureau being superior. In the match between the Municipal Government and the Land Bureau, the two guards strictly guarded the enemy. The left forward, Zong Xiaojie, galloped in the enemy's camp, stealing the ball and shooting at the basket as if there was no one there, scoring 22 points alone, which was truly courageous. In the match between the Social Affairs Bureau and the Health Bureau, the two sides held their ground in the first half, resulting in a score of 22 to 16. Although the Health Bureau was not successful, the difference in the score was not too great. In the second half, they plummeted, with the Social Affairs Bureau adding 37 points while the Health Bureau only scored three points, resulting in a crushing defeat of 59 to 19.</p>
<p>Construction of the National Games Venue</p>
<h3>Expected to Be Completed This Month丨Registration Deadline is the 25th</h3>
<p>Elementary School Students in Beijing Perform General Exercises</p>
<p>Nanjing, 18th - All the construction of the National Games venue is expected to be completed this month. The organizers have decided to hold the games as scheduled. The registration deadline is the 25th, so in recent days, many provinces have registered with the organizers, with as many as 25 provinces and regions. The Beijing Municipal Preliminary Games were originally scheduled to be held at the National Games venue, but due to the coal cinder used for the track being washed away by water, it will be difficult to complete on time. Therefore, the preliminary games have been changed to the Central University playground.</p>
<p>The principals of municipal schools in southern Beijing decided on the 17th that senior students in the city will participate in general exercises at this National Games. The specific measures will be determined separately.</p>

<h3>Central University Held Preliminary Games Yesterday</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 18th - Yesterday afternoon, Central University held preliminary games on campus. The purpose was to allow new students to practice track and field, so that they could be selected to participate in the city games. Because school has not started, there were not many students present, so there were very few participants in each event, and the results were mediocre.</p>
<h3>Mr. Jing Renqing Wins the Championship in the Ren Group in the City No. 1 Stadium Amateur Tennis Tournament</h3>
<p>The singles competition of the amateur tennis tournament at the City No. 1 Stadium was divided into ten groups. The championships for nine of the groups had been decided before the 31st of last month. Only Tang Shuming and Jing Renqing in the Ren group were evenly matched and needed to be re-decided. At 9 a.m. yesterday, the order was given, and the two men fought their final battle. Tang Shuming took the lead in the first set, attacking fiercely and winning 6 to 1. However, in the second and third sets, he was too eager for success and his methods were too aggressive. The balls he hit repeatedly touched the net, which was controlled by Jing Renqing. The scores were 6 to 3 in both sets. Thus, Mr. Jing won the championship for the Ren group in this tournament.</p>

<h3>Two District Party Departments Send Telegrams Condemning Guangdong and Guangxi</h3>
<p>The Guomin News Agency reports that the First and Fifth District Party Departments of this city yesterday sent telegrams denouncing the Guangdong faction for engaging in war, harming the country, and undermining peace. The original text is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Telegram from the First District Party Department: To all newspapers and fellow compatriots nationwide, it is noted that in recent years, natural and man-made disasters have occurred in rapid succession. Internal and external troubles are pressing in. The Northern Expedition had just achieved unity when the Communist bandits in Hunan and Jiangxi raised their heads. Diplomacy was gradually making progress when the Wan-Korean incident broke out. Then floods struck, covering sixteen provinces. Compatriots were displaced, reaching sixty million. The old, the young, the weak, and the disabled were buried in the bellies of fish, while the strong men and women had no home to return to. At a time when people at home and abroad share compassion and the whole country is working together to relieve the disaster, the rebels in Guangdong and Guangxi are actually claiming to use troops to invade Hunan, willingly becoming the heads of the bandits. Their gloating over the misfortune and undermining peace is utterly inhumane and devoid of conscience. Reading the telegrams from comrades Chiang and Zhang from Dongjiang, calling for peace and cessation of hostilities, suppressing bandits, and relieving the disaster, all of us of Chinese descent are moved and inspired. Based on this purpose, we send a telegram to the whole country, willing to share the country's difficulties, urgently needing rest and recuperation. We ask that you show compassion for the people's suffering and not allow the resurgence of war. We must cease fighting and seek other ways to ensure the well-being of the nation. This depends on this. If there are those who are stubborn and willing to risk the wrong, then we can only telegraph the Central Government to clearly order a punitive expedition to maintain unity and preserve peace. We respectfully present our sincerity, hoping for your understanding. Qiao, First District Party Department of the Chinese Nationalist Party, Shanghai Special City.</p>
<p>Telegram from the Fifth District Party Department: To all newspapers, it is noted that this year, internal and external troubles have been pressing in, and natural and man-made disasters have occurred one after another. All those with a conscience are saddened and worried, rising up with all their strength and wisdom to jointly overcome the national crisis. However, at this difficult time, the authorities in Guangdong and Guangxi are actually using troops to invade Hunan, undermining peace, and wanting to make our wandering and precarious China relive the irrecoverable state. Who can believe that they are not insane? The two telegrams from comrades Chiang and Zhang from Dongjiang are righteous and well-reasoned, and are supported by the whole country. If the Guangdong faction has any conscience, they should take the overall situation into consideration, cherish the lives of the people, repent and change their plans, and submit to the Central Government. Why don't they consider this, but instead think of acting arbitrarily, risking the wrong? Isn't this isolating themselves from the people and the party-state? This association, aware of the many difficulties facing the party-state, believes that to eradicate the root of the evil, it is necessary to clearly order a punitive expedition against Guangdong and Guangxi, to save the situation and rescue the people from fire and water. In addition to requesting the Central Government to immediately order a punitive expedition against Guangdong and Guangxi to maintain unity, we are sending this special telegram, respectfully requesting the attention of all sectors. Qiao, Fifth District Party Department of the Chinese Nationalist Party, Shanghai Special City.</p>
<p>Zhu Qinglan Suggests Measures to Guide the Huai River</p>
<h3>Telegram Sent to the Huai River Guidance Committee Discussing Five Points</h3>
<p>General Zhu Qinglan, a standing committee member of the National Government Flood Relief Committee, sent a telegram to the Huai River Guidance Committee yesterday, saying: "To Chairman Zhuang and all members of the Nanjing Huai River Guidance Committee, it is noted that this year, the Yangtze River and the Huai River basin have been overflowing and causing great pain. Now your committee is holding a general meeting. I would like to contribute five points: (1) Please start promoting the work immediately. (2) Please guide the Huai River into the sea, still using the old course of the Yellow River, straightening the river bend in Lianshui County and entering the sea through Qitao Town and Taozikou, which can avoid local disputes. (3) Implement military labor and recruit more disaster victims to provide relief through work. (4) When guiding the Huai River into the sea, we should also plan for the downstream. (5) If there is overflow land on both sides, villages can be designated to reward officers and soldiers who open the river. This matter has been discussed with Chairman Xu Jingren and Chief Engineer Li Yizhi. Please give your committee a discussion." Zhu Qinglan, Qiao.</p>

(6) The Shanghai Chinese Jisheng Society wrote a letter stating that, according to Mr. Feng Yangshan's report, the disaster situation in various counties of Henan Province was extremely severe. The society had previously allocated 40,000 yuan, for which they were very grateful, but it was still insufficient. The Jisheng Society had added another 25,000 yuan to provide relief in one area alone, and hoped that this association would consider doubling the relief funds for Henan Province. (7) The Shanghai Chinese Jisheng Society wrote a letter stating that the previously allocated relief funds for northern Anhui were insufficient for distribution, requesting this association to increase the amount. Also, Messrs. Liu and Qu stated in a telegram that the disaster area was vast, and they could only manage a few counties, which would require consultation with various parties. They also sent 500 bags of rice to Anhui for relief, requesting that it be forwarded without a separate receipt. Another telegram from Mr. Liu stated that it would be more convenient to convert the rice into cash, and the society had already used the rice for relief elsewhere and would remit the proceeds. Also attached were eight reports from various locations. (8) The Relief Association forwarded a telegram from Mr. Jin Junwen of Zhenjiang, reporting on the disaster situation in Gao Shao. (9) Chen Bogang of the Navigation Association wrote a letter stating that he could not attend the meeting to work, but regarding transportation matters, please notify him by telephone, and he would comply. (10) Zhang Xiaolin reported on his efforts to solicit donations for flood relief from Chinese and foreign landlords, and would report again when he had results. He requested that the publicity team pay special attention to and actively promote rent contributions for relief. In addition, there were letters and telegrams from various public associations, including the Tongling County Flood Relief Association, the Anhui Dangtu Flood Relief Association in Beijing, Li Shican of the Henan Relief Association in Ping, the Anhui Guangjiwei Flood Relief Association, and the Wangjiang County Cloth Industry Association, reporting on the disaster situation and requesting relief aid. (B) Discussion Items: (1) On the matter of distributing relief funds, it was resolved to allocate the remaining 130,000 yuan to the six provinces of Hubei, Hunan, Anhui, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, and Henan, with 20,000 yuan to each province. The remaining 10,000 yuan would be used to purchase turnip and rapeseed seeds, which would be given to Mr. Liu Lingsheng in northern Anhui for widespread planting. Also, of the 20,000 yuan for Anhui, 7,000 yuan would be given to Zhang Gongheng and Qu Zhancheng in southern Anhui, 7,000 yuan to Xu Pingxuan in central Anhui, and 6,000 yuan to Liu Lingsheng in northern Anhui. (2) On the matter of how to handle the association's expenses, as the 20,000 yuan requested from the Relief Committee had not yet been received and the current funds were exhausted, it was resolved to allocate 2,000 yuan first. (3) Wang Pinggeng telegraphed, asking how to cover the expenses for distribution of the 40,000 yuan from this association and the 20,000 yuan from Jisheng Society by himself.

<h3>Director Pan Discusses the Situation of Receiving Disaster Victims in This City</h3>
<p>In recent days, disaster victims from various places have continuously arrived in Shanghai. Yesterday, this reporter from Wuchen visited Director Pan of the Social Affairs Bureau and inquired about the recent situation regarding the reception of disaster victims. The main points of Mr. Pan's remarks are summarized as follows: (1) The First Reception Center on Liuying Road has been continuously receiving people, and the number has reached over 2,500. Each person is registered by name and organized by room, with a room leader designated to assist in care. (2) Regarding food, three meals are provided daily: porridge in the morning and dry rice for lunch and dinner. (3) Regarding clothing, in addition to disinfecting and distributing the clothes donated by various sectors, single-layer shirts and pants are being made and issued. Now that the autumn wind is gradually tightening, the office is rushing to make cotton-padded clothes and quilts. (4) Regarding medicine, there are separate Chinese and Western medicine departments. The Western medicine department has a resident chief physician, and the National Medicine Association and Pharmaceutical Association provide Chinese medicine. More than 100 people seek treatment daily. (5) Regarding public security, there are more than 30 police officers on duty and guarding. (6) Regarding fire prevention, 24 fire extinguishers have been borrowed from the Home Industry Society and installed in the center to prevent accidents, but it is still feared that this is insufficient, and it is planned to request additional loans. (7) Regarding hygiene, men's and women's bathrooms and washrooms have been completed, and administrators supervise rotating bathing. There are also public toilets, and all facilities can be said to be basically in place. (8) The first completed section of the First Reception Center, with 240 rooms, is now full, and the remaining 160 rooms are being rushed to completion. (9) Regarding funds, only 50,000 yuan has been received from the municipal government, plus several thousand yuan in donations. However, the estimated reception cost for 5,000 people is at least 1,000 yuan per day for food alone, not to mention the cost of clothing, bedding, sheds, and other expenses. In one month, it will take more than 50,000 yuan to manage. The reception center does not solicit donations from outside, and deeply hopes that all sectors will provide voluntary assistance. (10) In recent days, various provinces upstream of the Yangtze River and the Jiangbei Huaiyang area have continued to send disaster victims to Shanghai without prior notice or consultation. Large numbers often arrive at the port late at night. The staff of the Disaster Victim Reception Office have been working almost day and night to handle the reception, and their morale is difficult to maintain. Since no prior notice was received, preparation was impossible. Furthermore, these disaster victims come from various provinces, and their usual character and occupation are unknown. Disaster areas provide free transportation, so many unemployed vagrants and those who are greedy for small gains wear disaster victim signs and mix in. There are no special escorts, so these disaster victims have freedom of movement after arriving in Shanghai and cannot be tracked. These are the most difficult issues for the local authorities in this city. After suffering from hunger, cold, and hardship, disaster victims hope to receive excellent treatment in Shanghai, which is human nature. They do not consider the difficulties of the office and only feel dissatisfied, which is to be expected. However, in all fairness, the authorities in the disaster areas of various provinces and cities should pay full attention to this point. Otherwise, sending disaster victims to Shanghai in a disorganized manner is equivalent to a "beggar-thy-neighbor" policy. In my humble opinion, instead of sending disaster victims to Shanghai as much as possible, it would be better to set up reception centers in high, dry, and safe areas near the disaster areas. Shanghai's fundraising organizations can continuously send clothing, food, bedding, and cash to provide assistance, avoiding the waste of time and money on repeated sending and returning. The Flood Relief Committee, the various provincial emergency relief associations, and various charitable organizations should also work together to this end.</p>
<h3>News from the Municipal Disaster Victim Office</h3>
<p>Inviting Relevant Clan and Trade Guilds to Assist: Most of the disaster victims arriving in this city come from Hubei, Hunan, Anhui, Jiangxi, Jianghuai, and other places, with different dialects and customs. The Shanghai Disaster Victim Reception Office fears that language differences may cause misunderstandings. Furthermore, it has been reported that some petty criminals have mixed in with the disaster victims, pretending to be in distress, and that it is difficult to ascertain whether each place has actually suffered a disaster without the investigation of fellow villagers. On the 12th of this month, letters were sent to the clan and trade guilds of Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Jianghuai, requesting them to send personnel to the reception centers to assist in management and hospitality. The Hunan Guild has already declined. The Hubei Guild stated yesterday through Gao Jianqing that it would send Zeng Shouhe to serve at the center. The Anhui Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association has been the most enthusiastic, sending three gentlemen, including Zhu Runbin, and six or seven staff members to serve at the reception center, working day and night like the center's staff. The Lianghu Public School also voluntarily declared to the office yesterday that it was willing to send Tao Jingwu to serve at the center. Other guilds and fellow villagers associations have not yet responded.</p>
<h3>Sending Letters to the Business Community to Solicit Work for Disaster Victims</h3>
<p>The Municipal Disaster Victim Office believes that disaster victims who have been received should be given work. Yesterday, it issued a notice to the business community of this city, stating that the office has received over 3,000 male and female disaster victims from Xiang, E, Wan, Gan, and Jiangbei, who are idle all day long, which is not appropriate. Setting up factories would be too costly and is not possible for the time being. Therefore, it is requesting the business community to consider the unemployment and displacement of the disaster victims. If there is any work that requires labor, please share it with the disaster victims to provide relief. Please contact the office for details.</p>
<h3>Kong Xiangxi Welcomed the Japanese Disaster Relief Delegation Yesterday</h3>
<p>Kong Xiangxi, Standing Committee Member of the National Government's Flood Relief Committee, welcomed Mr. Fukao and Mr. Funatsu, the Japanese disaster relief delegates sent to China with a large amount of relief goods and funds from Japan, by holding a tea party at his residence on Avenue Petain in the French Concession at 4:30 PM yesterday. Standing Committee Members Zhu Qinglan, Xu Shiying, Yu Qiaqing, Committee Members Zha Liangzhao, Wang Xiaolai, Zhang Yuanshan, and Foreign Committee Member Yang Ge were present. Minister Kong personally hosted the event. During the event, in addition to the committee members discussing relief matters, they expressed their gratitude to the Japanese delegates Fukao and Funatsu. The meeting adjourned at about 6:00 PM. It is said that the two delegates will depart for the disaster areas along the Yangtze River after the arrival of the Japanese relief goods in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>News from the Jiangsu Flood Relief Association</h3>
<p>The Urgency of Seeking Relief in Huaiyin: Yu Yunliu of the Huaiyin County Relief Branch wrote to the Shanghai Jiangsu Flood Relief Association stating that Huaiyin is located in Jiangbei, and the land is barren and the people are poor. Since July, there has been continuous rain, causing rivers and lakes to overflow. Floods have swept through all seven districts of the county. In the first district, along both banks of the Grand Canal in Jiangbei, more than ten villages including Yaodong, Yaoxi, Duzhuang, and Longzhao have had their fields completely submerged and countless houses collapsed. Residents in low-lying areas within the city are living in water. In the second district, bordering Hongze Lake, more than twenty of the thirty-eight townships in the district are submerged in water. Although the disaster is lighter, the water level in the flatlands of the townships is still three to four feet. Boats travel on the roofs of houses in Shunheji. The embankments of Zhangwei, Chenji, and Xiwuji have been completely destroyed, making this the most severely affected area in the county. In the third district, the old Yellow River has low-lying terrain, and all the waters converge. Villages such as Xiaoying, Nanbeizhen, Hetian, Linhu Wangwei, Renhe, and Xiawei, as well as Patriotic Villages 1, 2, and 3, Siqiu Villages 1, 2, and 3, and Daxingzhuang Villages East, West, South, and North have had their autumn crops completely submerged. In the fourth district, the Xiajiahugou area has accumulated water into canals, forming a vast expanse of water. In the fifth district, the villages of Liupizhen, Fengyi, Delin, Lianzhuang, Sunwei, Youlian, Yongan, and Le'an are all submerged by several feet of water, and the fields and seedlings have been completely destroyed. In the sixth district, the villages of Tanghe, Linhu, Guangou, Taizihao, Huiji, Taishan Lake, Qili Lake, Xiaotan, Taozha, and Jiuxian, as well as the Guangou Cliff near Xiaoqiao, Jiubao, Liubao, and the area near Honghu Lake have had their houses drifting and their crops completely submerged. The seventh district is located on the banks of Honghu Lake, and all seven townships in the district are submerged. In total, the disaster area in the county covers more than 1,051 square kilometers, with more than 900,000 mu of crops submerged, resulting in a complete loss of harvest. Approximately 5,000 households have had their houses destroyed, resulting in direct losses of approximately 6 million yuan. Approximately 300 people have died, and approximately 185,000 people have been displaced. The good farmland has been transformed into habitats for fish, and the sounds of cooking fires have ceased. All that can be seen are treetops and the corners of houses swaying in the raging waves. Disaster victims are living in the open on the banks of the Taihuang and Honghu Lakes, crying out in distress and awaiting food. The situation is so dire that it has not been seen in a century. If relief is not provided quickly, they will inevitably die. People's lives are at stake, which is unimaginable. Although local communities in this county have taken the lead in raising funds and selecting those most in need of relief, the disaster area is too large and the number of disaster victims is too great. A drop in the bucket is of no use. We have long admired your association's compassion for the suffering of living beings and its benevolent spirit of universal salvation, benefiting disaster victims, maintaining social order, and preserving the nation's vitality. Therefore, we urgently report the disaster situation and earnestly request your benevolent assistance as soon as possible so that our lives can be extended. We are infinitely grateful for your great kindness. We await your orders with utmost urgency. Liu Yongrun, Chairman of the Huaiyin County Relief Branch, and all disaster victims bow in unison. Sincerely.</p>
<p>The Appeal from the Tenth District of Gaoyou: The Gaoyou Tenth District Flood Relief Fundraising Committee telegraphed the Jiangsu Flood Relief Association stating that since 1928 and 1929, drought had plagued their district. Only a partial harvest was achieved last year. This year, since the beginning of summer, there has been continuous rain for a month, and all the low-lying fields have been submerged. Later, the Grand Canal swelled violently, and the dam was opened before autumn, causing the high-lying fields to be submerged again, resulting in a complete loss of harvest. On August 26, the city walls at Dangjunlou, Hehuatang, Qigongdian, and other places breached, turning the entire district into a swamp. Countless houses have collapsed. The 100,000 disaster victims in the district are crying out for food. Because the district is located in a remote area, the city cannot provide much assistance. They earnestly request the urgent remittance of food and relief funds to save the remaining survivors. The 100,000 disaster victims will be grateful for the life-saving grace. The Gaoyou County Tenth District Flood Relief Fundraising Committee bows in unison. Sincerely.</p>
<h3>Lian Shui Representatives Come to Shanghai Seeking Relief</h3>
<p>In Lian Shui this past spring, continuous rain lasted for ten days, resulting in a poor wheat harvest. Bandit and Communist looting and riots during the summer caused even greater losses. In March of this year, a hurricane caused widespread destruction, destroying almost all civilian houses. In April, there were three severe frosts, killing more than half of the wheat seedlings. Since June, there has been continuous rain for a month, and the Yi and Huai Rivers have swollen violently at the same time, causing the Yifan, Minbian, Gongxing, Yuhuang, and other river basins to flood, with the water level in the flatlands reaching several feet. The north Liutang River embankment in the county breached in several places. It is estimated that the total disaster area in the county is more than 3,900 square li, with not only a complete loss of the autumn harvest, but also countless houses collapsing and being washed away. More than 110,000 disaster victims are exposed to the wind and dew and crying out for food. The various agencies have organized a flood relief association and telegraphed the provincial government and various relief agencies and charitable organizations to request funds for relief. Because the disaster situation is extremely severe, the association has sent Wang Youding, Director of the Construction Bureau, as a representative to Shanghai to report the disaster situation in person to various charitable organizations and request them to allocate funds for emergency relief.</p>
<h3>News from the Red Cross Hankou Rescue Team</h3>
<p>The Hankou Rescue Team dispatched by the Chinese Red Cross Society is continuing its work in Heshan, administering vaccinations and treating illnesses. The branch has hired two small boats for convenient transportation to and from the area. Director Jin of the Ministry of Health has sent a portion of his staff to remain on the streets of Wuhan, where they are working together to administer vaccinations and treat disaster victims. Many people are seeking treatment, especially those suffering from rotten feet, which is caused by being immersed in water all day long. True cholera has now been discovered in Heshan. The situation has been reported to Director Jin, who immediately performed surgery and administered cholera vaccines to prevent the spread of infection. The water level in the Hankou area remains the same, and the team members continue to leave early and return late. Although they are working very hard, they dare not neglect their duties. The team has been working extremely hard in recent days. Three large wooden boxes of medicine were shipped from the Yangtze River Steamship Company today for their use.</p>
<h3>Special Envoy Liang Shichun of the Youth Association Discusses the Hankou Disaster</h3>
<p>The National Youth Association, in view of the particularly severe disaster situation and the concentration of refugees in the Wuhan area, sent its secretary Liang Shichun to Hankou to conduct an on-site inspection and to liaise with the local youth association and relief branch to assist in relief measures. Recently, a telegram was received from Hankou requesting that secretaries Zheng Wei, Shu Boyan, and Jiang Wenhan be sent to Hankou to handle the relief work on a long-term basis, initially for a period of three months. They have already been ordered to go. Mr. Liang returned to Shanghai from Hankou yesterday and said that he flew to Hankou and saw that the Yangtze River banks from Nanjing to Wuhan were a vast expanse of water, with houses gone and fields completely submerged. Although the accumulated water in the city is gradually receding, the vast fields are flooded, and there is no way to discharge the water. The future disaster is extremely dangerous. Even in the present, tens of millions of disaster victims are displaced and living like years. If large-scale relief and rehabilitation are not carried out quickly, the consequences will be dire. He hopes that people across the country will come together to help. Mr. Liang also said that the Wuhan reception centers, with the exception of one or two that are relatively complete, are mostly poorly equipped and have no one in charge. As a result, many refugees are ill and dying in succession. Medical and rescue matters are particularly urgent.</p>
<h3>The Hunan Relief Association Hosted the Press Last Night</h3>
<p>The Hunan Shanghai Relief Fundraising Association hosted the press at 8:00 PM last night. Ye Kaixin, a Standing Committee Member of the Fundraising Association, and others were present to host the event. Ye first reported on the severity of the disaster in Hunan. Due to inconvenient transportation, outsiders are mostly unaware of the truth. He hoped that the press would promote the cause more, which would be a great merit. The characteristics of the Hunan disaster are sixfold: (1) Hunan Province suffered from successive bandits and Communists last year, and the wounds have not yet healed. Now it has suffered another flood disaster. (2) Mountain floods broke out upstream, and Hengxiang and other counties were affected by the disaster, which was the earliest period between spring and summer. (3) Downstream counties such as Nanhua suffered both mountain floods and a month of continuous rain, and were also backfilled by the West River of the Yangtze River, with some being affected by the disaster as many as four or five times. (4) In addition to the flood disaster, there was also an insect plague. (5) Of the 73 counties in the province, 67 reported disasters, covering a very wide area. (6) There were more than 15 million disaster victims, a very large number. The meeting adjourned at about 10:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Allocation of Emergency Relief Funds for Anhui Province</h3>
<p>Of the 60 counties in Anhui Province, 48 counties have been affected by the disaster. The National Government Relief Association recently allocated 300,000 yuan in emergency relief funds to Anhui Province. The amount allocated to each county has now been determined according to the severity of the disaster in the area, as follows: Huaining, Wangjiang, Tongcheng, Wuwei, Li County, Xuancheng, Guichi, Dongliu, Tongling, Fengyang, Huoqiu, Wuhe, Shou County, Fengtai, Huaiyuan, Fuyang, Lingbi, Dangtu each received 10,000 yuan.

<h3>Zhizhi College to Fundraise Today</h3>
<p>Faculty, staff, and students of the Jiangwan Zhizhi College, in view of the severe flood disasters in various provinces, will hold a roadside fundraising event today using bamboo collection tubes to fulfill their duty of mutual assistance as fellow countrymen. All funds raised will be sent to the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association for transfer to the disaster areas. Yesterday, Lao Jianzhao was sent to contact the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association. Before the fundraising event begins today, the association will send personnel to count the number of bamboo tubes. After the fundraising event ends, the bamboo tubes will be sealed. Tomorrow, both parties will jointly open the bamboo tubes and count the funds, and a receipt will be issued. Today is Saturday, the day of the Jiangwan horse race, and there are sure to be many tourists. People have compassion for disaster relief, so it is expected that the college's fundraising results will be considerable.</p>
<h3>News of Assistance from Various Sectors</h3>
<p>Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company Donates for Relief: The Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company had previously provided relief during the Guangdong disaster and is now doing the same in the Yangtze River area. In addition to the 3,000 yuan previously donated to the National Government Flood Relief Committee, male and female employees of the Shanghai factory donated 1,500 yuan in wages, which has been sent to the Renji Charity Hall for verification by the Fundraising Association for Flood Relief in Various Provinces. In addition, staff and directors of the head office and branch offices have made great efforts to raise funds, amounting to another 10,000 yuan. Furthermore, at the Xiang, E, Wan, Gan, and Ning branch offices, 8 yuan will be deducted from the price of each carton of top-grade cigarettes, 6 yuan for medium-grade cigarettes, and 3 yuan for lower-grade cigarettes, starting for three months. The prices of all cigarettes will not be increased to avoid increasing the burden on the people in the disaster areas. Recently, the sales of the company's Baijinlong, Changcheng, Aiguo, Daxiao Lianzhu, Honglü Daxi and other cigarettes have been very strong. It is expected that the amount deducted in three months will be at least 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. The company can be said to be enthusiastic about relief.</p>
<p>Cigarette Manufacturers Continue to Pledge Donations: Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Cigarette Manufacturers Association sent representatives Shen Weiting and Hong Huiguan to contact the factories that had not yet attended the meeting to continue to pledge donations.

<p>Li Wang of the American Chinese Youth Newspaper, Liang Shaochu, General Secretary of the Chinese Youth Association, and others initiated a fundraising effort, together with Mr. Hou Zhi'er, the purser of the ship, among Chinese and foreign passengers, to raise funds for disaster relief in the Yangtze River area. As a result, Chinese people donated a total of US$193.50, and foreigners donated a total of more than US$200, totaling more than US$400, equivalent to more than 2,000 national currency dollars. The funds were handed over to the purser of the ship on the 11th, and sent to the accounting department of Dale Company in this port, and then transferred to the National Government Relief Committee for collection.</p>
<p>Western Overseas Hospital Ship and Women's Fundraising, according to the "Zi Lin Daily," the hospital ship organized by Western expatriates in this port is now ready and will set sail to Hankou on Sunday morning to prevent and treat epidemics. The ship is named "Hanna Moller" and is currently docked at the Jiangnan Shipyard. Previous donors can board the ship for a visit on Saturday. In addition, the donations raised by women's groups selling flags on the 12th of this month have been counted, totaling 4,751 yuan, 4 jiao, and 8 fen, which have also been allocated to this project. As of today, the hospital ship donation has reached a total of 18,498.53 taels of silver and 26,779.48 yuan in silver dollars, according to reports.</p>
<p>Zhi Lan Society Raised 133 Yuan. During the dinner party held by the Zhi Lan Society on the 13th of this month, Messrs. Bao Weiyang, Ding Zifeng, and Wang Tingkai proposed fundraising on the spot. The members generously donated, raising a total of 133 silver dollars, which were all handed over to the China Red Cross Water Disaster Relief Association for distribution to the disaster areas for relief.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Bar Association Proposes Commuting Criminal Sentences to Assist Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>Before the Amendment of the Criminal Code</p>
<p>Adopting a Temporary Commutation System</p>
<p>The Shanghai Bar Association yesterday submitted a recommendation to the National Government Legislative Yuan, Judicial Yuan, and Ministry of Judicial Administration, stating: "Regarding the matter of recommendation, according to the proposal of 30 members of this association, including Qian Shusheng and Huang Han, it is found that this year's water disaster is serious and affects more than ten provinces. Raising funds for urgent relief is indeed an important plan. The various fundraising methods proposed and implemented by the government, various charity relief organizations, mass organizations, merchants, and individuals can be said to be meticulous. Our Bar Association and colleagues share a benevolent heart, how dare we lag behind? However, relying solely on individual donations is inevitable that our hearts exceed our strength, and the effect is ultimately limited. In the opinion of the members, the current judicial system, except for serious cases of kidnapping, murder, and theft that should be punished with the death penalty and cannot be evaded, the execution of criminals sentenced to imprisonment or below is aimed at reforming them according to the current criminal policy. However, due to the shortage of prison funding and various inadequate facilities, the number of people who can achieve the purpose of reform is very few, judging from the facts. Therefore, some habitual criminals often go to prison several times without any repentance, because they have not received proper training during their execution, and they have no skills to make a living after being released from prison. As a result, they regard the prison as their place to live and eat. In addition, those who are punished by verdicts due to temporary bad motives, even if they are lenient with their past, will not harm the society. Therefore, in view of the serious disaster situation, it is proposed to the government to allow them to pay money to redeem their sentences, depending on the nature of the crime, the length of the sentence, and the number of offenses. The standards for payment of redemption money may also be determined separately according to the severity of the crime, the length of the sentence, and the individual's property. A temporary regulation should be drafted and promulgated, and it should be implemented uniformly for all convicted and unconvicted criminals. All redemption money will be directly remitted by the receiving courts to the government's disaster relief agency for disaster relief, and reported to the competent authority for record. This seems to alleviate the congestion in prisons, while also implying the meaning of fines and penalties, and the collected redemption money is used entirely for disaster relief, which can further help the disaster victims. Whether it is feasible or not, we respectfully propose it and request your review and public decision for implementation. In addition, member Yao Jian proposed that this year's flood in China has affected 80 million people. Although the government has issued 80 million public bonds, the average per person is only one yuan. Although the people are willing to donate, it is difficult to reach more than 80 million yuan. The government should follow all requests that do not harm the vitality of the country. In recent years, the number of crimes has increased, and all provinces are suffering from overcrowded prisons, which cost the national treasury. Now, in order to save the disaster victims and divert the prisoners' food, those whose crimes are punishable by less than five years, regardless of gender or crime, whether convicted or unconvicted, will be allowed to temporarily commute their sentences to fines, starting from this month. Each day will be valued at one or two yuan, and they will be allowed to commute their sentences with cash. The commutation money is calculated at an average of 1,000 yuan per person, and 10,000 people will have 10 million yuan (the number of criminals in the Shanghai Chinese Concession is more than 10,000). The national total should be more than 80 million yuan. Those with sentences of more than five years, except for those sentenced to death, kidnappers, and robbers, should be sent to the disaster areas as laborers for river management, with one day of labor offsetting two days of imprisonment. This will empty the prisons, allowing for harmony between heaven and earth, and the prisoners' food can also be diverted for relief. People who commute their sentences can work in society and become productive members. The state's formulation of commutation regulations for disaster victims is more glorious than the previous national day amnesty. Redemption is permitted by ancient laws and should not leave any trouble for future generations. All the above were brought to the meeting, and the 87th Executive Supervisory Committee of this association decided that the redemption system has a very long history in our country's legal system. From the redemption penalty in the Tang, Yu, and Xia dynasties to the detailed determination of the fine system by King Mu of Zhou for doubtful cases, Emperor Wu of Han established a system for redemption to collect military funds due to border affairs. The Tang, Song, Ming, and Qing dynasties all followed this system. From the death penalty to flogging, all were allowed to redeem according to the law. The current criminal law imitates Europe and the West, and does not adopt the old rules of flogging, exile, commutation, and redemption for criminal names, but adopts five types: death penalty, life imprisonment, fixed-term imprisonment, detention, and fines. In practice, there are only three types: death penalty, imprisonment, and fines (life imprisonment, fixed-term imprisonment, and detention are all detained in prisons according to Article 54 of the Criminal Law). The fine penalty is rarely applied in the Criminal Law Regulations. There are only eleven clauses for specialized fines, twenty-one clauses for commutable fines, and seventy-four clauses each for fixed-term imprisonment, detention, and fines, and for fixed-term imprisonment, detention, or fines. The five-level fixed-term imprisonment with conditional commutation of fines is not adopted by the current criminal law. Therefore, most offenders are sent to prison because of criminal convictions. As a result, all new and old prisons in the country are overcrowded, judicial revenue is sharply reduced, and prisoner food expenditures are soaring. The prison for reforming criminals has become an agency for training criminals, which has the opposite effect on the reform policy. The association, based on these reasons, proposed amending the criminal law's criminal names at the Second National Lawyers Association Congress in June of this year. The proposal has been forwarded by the association but has not yet been approved. Now, the members have proposed it again due to the huge need for disaster relief funds, which is beneficial to both reforming the criminal law and collecting disaster relief funds. The intangible reduction of crime and the appeal to harmony have a great impact on social psychology. For this reason, it is proposed to formulate specific clauses to recommend to your government, court, and ministries, and request a decisive decision to adopt it resolutely. The law will be fortunate, and disaster relief will be fortunate. "</p>
<p>Hua Shang Electric Workers Petitioned Yesterday</p>
<h3>Employee Treatment to be Mediated by Party and Government on a Fixed Schedule</h3>
<p>All employees of Hua Shang Electric held a major petition yesterday due to salary and conditions issues. The result was very satisfactory, and the trams in the concession area continued to operate as usual. The details of the various situations are recorded below.</p>
<p>Workers' Petition. The First District Water and Electricity Industry Union held an emergency general meeting at 7:00 AM yesterday, attended by more than 200 workers, chaired by Zhou Guangrong. He reported the advice of the Social Affairs Bureau not to hold a general petition to avoid misunderstandings. It was resolved that each branch should send two representatives to join the full-time executive directors and go to the Social Affairs Bureau at 8:00 AM to petition. Director Pan Gongzhan received them and expressed his responsibility to strictly order the company to fulfill the conditions, hoping that everyone would work with peace of mind and not take other actions. They then went to the Municipal Party Department, where Xu Yefu, the director of the Civil Training Section, received them and agreed to handle the matter together with the Social Affairs Bureau.</p>
<p>Union's Submission. The union submitted a document to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, stating: "Regarding the petition to strictly order the capitalists to fulfill the signed treatment agreement, it is said that the association previously received instructions from your bureau, and the agreement signed by both parties has been ordered by the capitalists to fulfill. The unresolved parts will be convened again. Upon receiving this, we immediately obeyed the order and sold tickets as usual. The association retreated ten thousand points, starting on July 14, and the treatment agreement of eleven articles was decided by both parties again. Who knew that the capitalists would relapse, and Articles 3, 4, 5, 7, and 10 of the repeatedly signed treatment agreement have not yet been fulfilled. After repeated urging, all were ineffective. All the workers believe that the capitalists are so stubborn that they not only deceive the workers, but also have no government in their eyes. The association's representative conference decided that all representatives would go to your bureau to petition, ordering the capitalists to fully fulfill the treatment agreement completely on the same day, otherwise the capitalists should be fully responsible for any accidents that may occur as a result. "</p>
<p>Staff Action. The Municipal Party Department specially sent Zhao Erchang yesterday to investigate thoroughly and advised all staff to resolve the matter according to law, and not to take other actions, and said that the Municipal Party Department has scheduled to convene a mediation meeting with the Social Affairs Bureau. After receiving the company's report, the Garrison Command ordered the company yesterday to promptly submit a complaint to the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation because it was a labor-capital dispute.</p>
<p>Staff Submission. All staff submitted a document to the Social Affairs Bureau and the Municipal Party Department yesterday for mediation, stating: "Regarding the capitalists' refusal to negotiate, please expedite the mediation to settle the dispute. All the staff of Hua Shang Electric Company, due to the hardship of life, requested the company to improve the treatment. Upon receiving the order from the Social Affairs Bureau, we asked the capitalists to negotiate by themselves. However, Lu Bohong, the manager of the company, did not care about the staff's hard life and acted arbitrarily, not only refusing to negotiate, but also not accepting any expression. The details of the capitalists' refusal to negotiate are reported in writing. Please expedite the appointment of a mediator to settle the dispute. "</p>
<p>Company Submission. (1) Hua Shang Electric Company submitted a document to the Social Affairs Bureau on the 16th, stating: "Regarding the reporting matter, upon receiving your bureau's instruction No. 14915, it said, "According to the petition from the representatives of all the staff of the company, Deng Shuping, etc., they said that they had made a request to improve the treatment conditions and negotiated with the capitalists several times, but were rejected. Later, after submitting a request to the Party Department for approval, they made a request again, but were still rejected." We ordered to negotiate, etc. Upon receiving this, according to the manager's authority, the various requests of the staff this time have been submitted to the board of directors for review and discussion. The representatives were convened and informed in person, but they ignored it. For example, the first time was about the subsidy for the Lianyi Society. It was submitted to the board of directors on July 7 and was approved after deliberation. Because the society's regulations involve the administrative scope of the company and are not purely recreational in nature, it is not convenient to approve it. The second time was about the eight conditions submitted on August 8, which was also submitted to the board of directors for deliberation. The manager and all colleagues are employees serving the company and have no distinction between labor and capital. Moreover, the staff salary table has long been stipulated by this association. Now, in order to organize it, the manager is responsible for informing each department to investigate the results and then review them. As for the retirement pension, bereavement allowance, and life savings, the same treatment methods as the workers should be used, and there is no need to set up separate rules. The above two resolutions of the board of directors have been informed to all staff by the manager. On September 8, according to the letter from the representatives, one said to endure the pain and make concessions, the other said it was difficult to retreat, and the other said it was unbearable, or it would cause other incidents, and the manager would be responsible, etc. This kind of gathering to coerce and intimidate with alarming words is not allowed by law. Seeing this letter, the board of directors, in order to prevent problems before they occur, has reported the general situation of the case to the chief. According to Article 3 and Article 16 of the Trade Union Law, employees of public utilities shall not organize trade unions, and trade unions of public utilities shall not have the right to conclude collective agreements. The staff of this company may not establish a union, and it is impossible to conclude an agreement. However, they have put forward conditions and set a deadline for signing, which is a violation of the law. Moreover, they posted notices inside and outside the company on the 12th of this month, which is even more arrogant. The manager believes that this matter may be initiated by a few young and good-for-nothing people. If they are not earnestly persuaded, it will be difficult for them to repent. Therefore, at 9:15 this morning, he convened all the staff to talk about the situation of the case, and the board of directors' treatment of the staff, all life savings, retirement pensions, and bereavement allowances, followed the workers' methods, that is, under the profit-sharing item, it was also increased by nine percent compared to the old rules. In addition, they should follow the company's regulations. However, before the manager finished speaking, Liu Xuekun, Lin Yiyun, Shen Yuping, Sun Zhifei, Ding Hanqing, and others spoke insultingly and argued loudly, still taking the conditions as the premise and being responsible by all the representatives. We don't want to hear about other things, and then shouted slogans to support the representatives and dispersed. At that time, it was about 9:20, except for all the staff of the documentation and accounting departments and a few staff members of each section, who were working as usual, the rest left the company, and the company's official business was suspended for a while, which was the same as a strike. This kind of deviant behavior was unexpected, and it is difficult to guarantee that there are no bad elements mixed in. Otherwise, I am afraid that they will be provoked and instigated by the outside world and used by others. Our company handles public utilities in the city, which is very important. For this reason, we attach a copy of the letter from the representatives on September 8 and the situation of the case and submit it to your bureau for review. This matter concerns public utilities and should be severely punished to maintain business and ensure public safety. It is for the public good. In addition, the words "representatives of all staff" at the end of the letter do not match the facts and are stated together. (2) Hua Shang Electric Company submitted a document to the Social Affairs Bureau, stating: "Regarding the reporting matter, it is found that the First District Water and Electricity Industry Union requested our company to sign a worker treatment agreement, which was signed by both parties on July 9 of this year. The only reason is that on July 4, our company's tram workers idled without selling tickets, causing losses to the company. The board of directors decided on July 8 to submit a report to your bureau, ordering the union to compensate for the losses. It was found that the usual fare revenue is more than 6,500 yuan on average. On that day, only more than 2,100 yuan was collected, with a loss of more than 4,400 yuan, which is equivalent to more than 1,600 yuan in silver dollars. We should have reported to your bureau to execute according to the resolution. The manager considered the workers' difficult life and temporarily reserved the case, originally wanting to give them a way to reform. On July 16, he wrote to the union, guaranteeing that each worker would abide by the company's regulations and work diligently in the future. If similar incidents occur again, all losses will be compensated in full, and the payment will be suspended from the life savings item or deducted from the bonus item to show punishment, etc. At that time, the manager and the union representatives stated that a guarantee letter must be returned before the subsidy fee of 5,000 yuan can be paid. However, the union has not yet returned the letter. The union has already received 2,000 yuan last month because they are in urgent need of use. There is no budget for how to use it. Therefore, the remaining 3,000 yuan should be paid according to the original agreement after the guarantee letter is returned and the expenditure budget is submitted in advance. This is because two months have passed and it has not been reported to be concluded. This is the reason. We should report the facts truthfully and respectfully ask for your attention. I think the director cherishes merchants and benefits workers, and has never been biased. There must be a way to improve it. Sincerely presented to the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau. "</p>

<h3>British Public Bus Company Fully Resumed Service Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ Company Orders Workers to Hand Over Uniforms</p>
<p>▲ Workers Have Organized Another Committee</p>
<p>▲ More Than Seventy Unions in the City Start to Assist</p>
<p>After the British Public Bus workers went on strike again, the company announced the dismissal of all striking workers. The Social Affairs Bureau rejected the strike because it had not been submitted for approval in accordance with legal procedures. All workers are preparing to go to the Municipal Government again to request mediation. From yesterday, public buses in the concession area have fully resumed. The details of the various situations are recorded below.</p>
<p>Service Resumed. The British Public Bus Company, according to the decision of the board of directors, is trying to restore the public buses on all routes. Now that most of the newly recruited workers are well-trained, from yesterday, it has fully restored the public buses on all routes in the concession area. The routes and prices have also returned to normal. Route 1: Jing'an Temple to Gongyuan Bazichang; Route 6: Waiyangjing Bridge to Gongyuan Bazichang; Route 5: Sanmaoge Bridge to North Railway Station; Route 7: Caojiadu to Nanyang University; Route 9: Jing'an Temple to Electric Light Factory; Route 10: Caojiadu to Hangxiang Port. Route 3 is located in the Chinese area, and Route 6 is located in the wilderness. Fearing worker riots, it is temporarily suspended.</p>
<p>No Hope of Returning to Work. After the company announced the dismissal of all striking workers, it refused to unconditionally return to work. Hua Dong's mediation was also ineffective. All workers will be completely unemployed due to the strike to demand improved treatment. The company has strictly ordered all striking workers to hand over their uniforms within a time limit and collect their savings to terminate the employment relationship. As of yesterday, more than 30 of the 254 striking workers, seeing that the negotiations were fruitless and the company's attitude remained tough, had returned their uniforms to the company and voluntarily resigned to find other jobs.</p>
<p>Workers' Petition. After receiving the rejection from the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau the night before, all the workers sent representatives Hong Mingdao, Xu Hongfei, etc. to the Central Party Department at 11:00 AM to petition, requesting the Social Affairs Bureau to consider the workers' livelihood and mediate again to avoid unemployment. Xu Yefu, the director of the Civil Training Section, received them and accepted the request. Then, they went to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition, requesting the withdrawal of the decision. Wang Bing received them and explained the reasons for the rejection. It is reported that all the workers will petition the Municipal Government for relief.</p>
<p>Strike Committee Dissolved. All the striking workers, in view of the unsound organization of the strike committee, the ineffectiveness of past work, internal divisions, and the dispersion of members, announced its automatic dissolution yesterday and reorganized the Committee for Requesting Resumption of Work, appointing Hong Mingdao, Xu Hongfei, and 12 others as members. The internal organization is divided into six sections: communication, accounting, documentation, communication, and special affairs, with one chief and one deputy chief in each section. It was officially announced yesterday and started work on the same day.</p>
<p>Labor Community Assistance. More than 70 unions in the city, including publishing, water and electricity, cigarette, cotton weaving, and cotton spinning, discussed the case of assisting the British Public Bus workers' strike in the Zhabei Publishing Industry Union at 1:00 PM yesterday. Chen Peide, Li Yongxiang, Gong Yuting, Lu Muqin, Cao Haosun, and others were appointed on the spot to investigate the content of the public bus workers and guide all the proceedings. Tui Dachun, Wang Yongliang, and Chen Peide went to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition.</p>
<p>Continued Recruitment of New Workers. Since the British Public Bus Company continued to recruit new ticket sellers the day before yesterday, as of yesterday, more than 500 people have registered, which shows the number of unemployed workers. 61 people, including Shi Baoshan, have been admitted and are undergoing training in the factory. The monthly salary is 20 yuan, food and lodging are not provided, and they have to provide a guarantor and fingerprint. It is insisted that striking workers will not be hired.</p>

<h3>Grand Occasion of Public Tour After the Arrival of the Sino-American Giant Liner President Hoover in Shanghai</h3>
<p>To compete in the Sino-American Pacific shipping business, the American trading company Dalla has invested US$16 million to build two new and fast mail ships, one named "President Hoover" and the other "President Coolidge," to sail the Shanghai-San Francisco-New York route. Now the first ship has been completed and arrived in Shanghai, docked at the China Merchants Bureau North Wharf. Yesterday, a simple invitation was extended to various sectors to tour the ship. This ship's loading capacity, speed, and elegance on the Pacific route surpass those of previous ships and can be said to set a new record in the Sino-American shipping industry. Details of the tour are recorded below:</p>
<p>A Grand Feast on Board: After the completion of the President Hoover, it came to Shanghai from the U.S. with a full load of passengers, arriving in Shanghai on the 17th. For the convenience of various sectors to tour the ship, it did not stop at the company's pier but docked at the China Merchants Bureau North Wharf. Dalla sent its second son, Harold, to supervise the voyage to China. On the first day, Mr. Harold specially prepared a grand feast on board and invited all the Chinese and Western employees of the Shanghai branch to the banquet at night. Mr. Harold, on behalf of his father, expressed his deep gratitude to the Shanghai branch staff for their daily hard work and cooperation, which made the business prosper. Mr. Harold recounted the process of building the new ship and spoke of the necessity of Sino-American economic cooperation. Mr. Harold also said that although he is an American, he has lived in China for a long time, and Shanghai is no less than his second hometown. The gathering ended happily at 11 o'clock.</p>
<p>Tour by Various Sectors: Yesterday, from 3:00 PM to 5:30 PM, the entire ship was open to welcome visitors from all walks of life. The police sent detectives to maintain order on the dock. All the staff of the Shanghai branch, such as Chuan Wenyuan, Wu Hongyuan, Tong Xinyuan, and Mr. Zuo, Yin, etc., were on board to act as hosts. Four thousand invitations were sent out in advance, but there were actually five to six thousand visitors yesterday. The routes were pre-arranged inside the ship, taking the method of "left out, right in" to prevent confusion and omissions for the guests. At each staircase entrance, there were staff to guide the guests. Almost all personnel from Chinese and foreign shipping companies in this port came to visit, especially Westerners. However, due to the short time, refreshments were not prepared.</p>
<p>The Ship's Immense Size: The President Hoover has a displacement of 33,000 tons, a length of 635 feet, and a depth of 81 feet. The entire ship has six decks, with 350 first-class cabins and 150 special-class cabins. In the first and special-class cabins, for the convenience of passengers to dress up, there are as many as 80 dressing rooms, as well as dedicated washrooms and other facilities. The third-class cabins can accommodate 700 people. In addition to the passenger cabins, the construction of the cargo holds is also very sophisticated. For example, the mail room, gold and silver room, lake silk room, tea room, and cold storage room are all set up separately. The perfection of management and the safety of cargo loading are truly the most meticulous.</p>
<p>Magnificent Decorations: The magnificence and splendor of the interior decorations of the ship can be said to break the records of all Pacific mail ships. The hall, dining room, smoking room, dance hall, gym, and writing room in the first-class cabin are all specially separated, with a wide area and magnificent layout. The murals on the four walls use granite, carvings, and embedded antique porcelain, with a variety of colors that are dizzying. The chairs and sofas are also different in each hall. The best ones are made of gold-threaded velvet. The carpets are all replaced with the finest, cleanest, most expensive thick wool rugs. Even the lamps use the latest style of cubism, all made of specially built Moroccan glass, forming various patterns. Even the ashtrays and spittoons are exceptionally exquisite, making people feel as if they are in a palace as soon as they enter. Each hall has wireless music.</p>
<p>Electric Propulsion: The ship uses the latest electric engine, fueled by oil, with great horsepower, capable of traveling 23 nautical miles per hour. It is currently the fastest ship on the Sino-American route. The reporter was guided by Mr. Tong Xinyuan to visit the engine room. The complexity of its weaving and the greatness of its physicality cannot be known by those who are not proficient in mechanics. We are only amazed by its greatness. It is said that the ship can also use its mechanical power to prevent the ship from rolling in the face of ocean waves, and passengers will no longer suffer from seasickness.</p>
<p>Departure for Hong Kong Today: Yesterday, the ship stopped all work for tours. Starting at 6 PM, night work was done to rush to load cargo. This morning, it departed from Shanghai for Hong Kong and Little Luzon, and is scheduled to come to Shanghai on October 2nd for its maiden voyage back to the U.S. After the President Hoover is in service, the three giant ships of the Japanese Post Office, Chichibu, Tatsuta, and Asama, were suppressed. Even Changxing's Empress of Japan, which originally occupied the position of the largest ship in the Pacific, now has to be second. There is also a sister ship of the same class as the Hoover, the President Coolidge, which is scheduled to leave the factory in November and come to Shanghai in mid-December. It is said that all the first-class seats on the President Hoover's trip to the United States have been booked. After the ship is in service, Dalla will suspend the President Johnson, and it will be retained for repairs of any ship.</p>
<h3>Long Baichun, Who Embezzled Military Pay, Was Arrested</h3>
<p>▲ Embezzled 17,000 Yuan</p>
<p>▲ Hidden in the Huitong Hotel</p>
<p>▲ Confiscated Savings Account and Stock Certificate</p>
<p>▲ Approved for Transfer to the Garrison Command for Interrogation</p>
<p>Long Baichun, a native of Guizhou who was an accountant in the Finance Department of the newly formed 10th Division of the Army in Hankou, colluded with his colleague Wen Tingcan in April of this year to embezzle 17,000 yuan in silver dollars that were ordered to be sent to Tongcheng as military pay. He absconded from his job with the money, and the division commander ordered his arrest. It was recently discovered that Long Baichun had fled to the Shanghai Public Concession, so a telegram was sent to the Songhu Garrison Command, which was forwarded to the First Special District Court to issue an arrest warrant. At 8:30 AM the day before yesterday, inspectors Wang Bin, Xu Pengfei, Yang Fengqi, and Wang Shaohua of the Garrison Command learned that Long was living in house number 2035, Hongrui Lane, Xinzha Road. They reported to the Xinzha Police Station and, together with Chinese detective Zhao Fuhai and Western detective Sears, went to the address to make an arrest, but found nothing. According to the tenant, Long had moved six weeks ago to room number 5, Huitong Hotel, number 24 Guangxi Road. The Chinese and Western detectives went to Huitong Hotel and arrested Long Baichun. They confiscated a savings account book from the Bank of China, with 764.38 yuan in it, and a stock certificate for 3,000 yuan from Huitong Hotel, and took them to the police station for custody. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The police lawyer, Wang Yaotang, stated the circumstances of the arrest and did not object to the transfer to the Garrison Command. Wang Bin, an inspector from the Garrison Command, also submitted an official document requesting the transfer. Judge Wu Tingqi verified the report, questioned Long Baichun briefly, and ordered him to be taken back by Wang Bin, an official from the Songhu Garrison Command.</p>
<h3>Daughter Opposes Father's Remarriage and Attempts Suicide by Drowning in the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>▲ Because the Anniversary of Mother's Death Had Just Passed</p>
<p>▲ Saddened by Suicide, Fortunately Rescued</p>
<p>Shen Aizhen, a local woman, is 23 years old and quite beautiful. She is currently a piano teacher at Moore Memorial Church on Hankou Road. Her father, Shen Jiyi, lives at number 9, Daan Lane, Rue Poncet in the French Concession. He has been engaged in social moralization and voluntary education throughout his life and is quite reputable. Recently, because the first anniversary of her mother's death last year had just passed, Aizhen suddenly heard that her father was planning to remarry. She tried hard to object to her father in person, but to no avail. She was so angered and world-weary that she took the number 6 ferry at the Hankou Road Custom House Wharf the day before yesterday afternoon, crossed to the middle of the river, and attempted to commit suicide by drowning. Fortunately, an old man, Monk Shi, bravely rescued her, and she was not sacrificed. She was immediately sent to the water police station, which sent detectives to summon her father, Shen Jiyi. Aizhen was taken home. The reporter obtained this information and, fearing that there might be other reasons, drove to the woman's father's address yesterday. According to Mr. Shen, his remarriage was for the sake of life's needs. The small daughter did not achieve her intention because of this matter, resulting in a suicidal act. It was truly a momentary thought error. Now, after much persuasion, the father and daughter are as loving as ever. There are absolutely no other incidents involved, he said.</p>
<h3>Proposal to Prevent Smuggling by Shipping Lines</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau and Jardine Matheson have recently written to the Public Works Department of the Public Concession to assist in preventing smuggling on ships docked at the Broadway Road wharf. They propose building several doors on North Yangzi Road to facilitate surveillance because the road is mostly occupied by goods and is of no benefit to the public. According to reports, several years ago, the Municipal Council discussed extending Huangpu Road and selling this Yangzi Road. Before long, the North Yangzi Road buried the main water pipe, and because relocation was difficult, the discussion was shelved. Now, Jardine Matheson also proposes to block Yuanfang Road, and the China Merchants Bureau proposes to block Taiping Road, because there are very few pedestrians on these two roads, and they are smuggling routes. The head of the Public Works Department believes that the request can be granted, but the required expenses should be borne by the shipping companies. The Municipal Council Committee discussed this matter and has not made a decision. It is proposed that the head of the Public Works Department inquire with the two companies for details before making a decision.</p>
<h3>Feng Shaoshan Returned to Shanghai the Night Before Last</h3>
<p>Feng Shaoshan returned to Shanghai on Jardine Matheson's Dongsheng ship at 8 PM the night before last. Two to three hundred people welcomed him at the port. After Feng landed, he shook hands with the welcomers one by one, and the relatives and friends escorted him to the New Asia Hotel to rest.</p>
<h3>Liu Haisu Returned to China Yesterday</h3>
<p>Liu Haisu, who went to Europe two years ago and traveled to various countries in Western Europe, arrived in Shanghai on the French mail ship Sarassin at 7 PM yesterday. More than five hundred people, including Chu Minyi, Ge Gongzhen, Wang Jiyuan, Lu Erqiang, and groups such as the Shanghai Art College, welcomed him at the port. When the ship arrived at the port, they shouted welcome slogans. Mr. Liu replied from the ship with a loudspeaker and introduced the great French writer (D.I.) who gave a brief speech.</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabric Expert Wu Jiazhen Returns to China</h3>
<p>Mr. Wu Jiazhen is the son of Mr. Wu Pinfang, namely the nephew of Mr. Wu Pinrui. He is 25 years old and a native of Zhenhai County, Zhejiang. In 1925, he went to France to study at the Roubaix Higher Textile School, majoring in textile and wool fabric. Mr. Wu is intelligent and successful in his studies. After graduating in 1928, he continued to study dyeing. He graduated this summer. In all the examinations, he ranked among the best. He specializes in both textile and wool fabric dyeing, and his knowledge and experience are extremely deep. It is rare to find talents in the country who specialize in both weaving and dyeing. It is learned that Mr. Wu left France on August 14th on the Sinus ship and returned to China. He arrived in Shanghai yesterday.</p>
<h3>Ye Garden Amusement Fair Opens Today</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Relief for Flood Disasters in Various Provinces Amusement Fair held in Jiangwan Ye Garden officially opens today. The invitation cards sent to various organizations, groups, and newspapers the day before yesterday were originally scheduled for the 17th, but were changed to today (the 19th) at 3:00 PM due to rain and incomplete arrangements. Tea and refreshments are specially prepared for the opening ceremony. Various badges issued are valid during the amusement period. Today, there are Peking Opera, Chinese and foreign fireworks, and various entertainments, which are rare in Shanghai, with more than a thousand kinds.

<p>Circulation Department of the Oriental Library News</p>
<h3>Book Borrowing Statistics</h3>
<p>The Oriental Library on Baoshan Road, Zhabei, has seen a surge in borrowing since it added a circulation department in June of this year. As of the end of August, a total of 3,177 kinds of books have been borrowed, of which literature books account for 40%, social sciences account for 1%, natural sciences account for 9.6%, applied technology accounts for 9.5%, history and geography account for 5.8%, philosophy accounts for 5.5%, fine arts account for 5%, religion and linguistics account for 9.6%, the total number of Western books borrowed accounts for 1% of the total, Japanese books account for 7%, and the rest are Chinese books. The number of borrowers is the largest in the academic community, followed by the business community, and then by the political and workers' circles. It is heard that a certain gentleman borrowed 109 kinds of books from various disciplines from the library in 87 days, which shows that the library's circulation department has made a great contribution to public welfare. The library has recently purchased a large number of Chinese and Western books, which will be numbered and completed within February to expand the operation. Those in this port who want to borrow books from the library can attach a postal letter to request detailed regulations. Due to the more complicated procedures in other ports, it is still under study.</p>
<h3>Ren Chunfeng and His Wife Request Confirmation of Parent-Child Relationship and Return to Ancestry</h3>
<p>▲ The Biological Son Is Wu Tongwen</p>
<p>▲ Previously Mediated, Now Involved in Litigation Again</p>
<p>Wu Tongwen, a paint tycoon, is the son of the late Wu Futang. Recently, a woman named Ren Zhou filed a petition with the Second Special Court to mediate the confirmation of the parent-child relationship and to request a judgment to return to the ancestry. Yesterday morning, Judge Qu opened a court for mediation. Neither party was present. First, Zheng Wenkai, the lawyer representing Ren Zhou, stated that the petitioner, Zhou, is 62 years old this year. Her husband, Ren Chunfeng, is a native of Shaoxing and is now suffering from paralysis in his hometown, so he did not come to Shanghai. The petitioner and his wife adopted their biological son (namely Wu Tongwen) to Wu Futang through the introduction of Mrs. Zhao on the fifth day of May twenty-seven years ago. Now the petitioner and his wife are thinking of their son and want their son to return to the ancestry. Unexpectedly, after the petitioner came to Shanghai, not only could the mother and son not meet, but they could not even enter the door. Therefore, they had no choice but to file a petition for mediation, requesting confirmation of the parent-child relationship and allowing them to return to the ancestry to comfort their old age, and so on. Xu Yannian, the lawyer representing Wu Tongwen, stated that Wu Tongwen is actually the son of Wu Futang, and Wu's mother is Xu. The petitioner, Ren Zhou, came to Shanghai once and borrowed 800 yuan from Wu Futang. Later, in 1928, she came to borrow again but failed. Lawyers Yan Tankang and others filed a lawsuit in the former French court. Subsequently, Chen Junbao came forward to mediate once and gave her 7,000 yuan in ocean dollars, and a settlement was reached. Both parties signed as proof, and the trial judge Chen Jieqing of the former French court stamped it for record. Now, the settlement certificate is presented for your examination. The fundamental facts of this case are inconsistent, and there is no need for mediation. Moreover, this case has been announced in various newspapers before mediation, which is obviously for other purposes. The settlement certificate is recorded as follows: (Ren Chunfeng and Ren Zhou, the undersigned husband and wife, due to economic difficulties and a difficult life, entrusted a lawyer to demand alimony from Wu Tongwen. Because of a momentary misunderstanding, they repeatedly asked the lawyer to sue in court, hoping to gain something. However, after thinking about it, there were many abruptnesses. It is difficult for the undersigned and his wife to claim alimony rights for the Wu family's assets. Moreover, Mr. Wu had previously lent the undersigned and his wife 800 yuan out of respect for the elderly and compassion for the poor, which has not yet been repaid, and should not cause further complications. For this reason, Chen Junbao was automatically requested to explain and mediate. Wu Jun was understood and, considering the circumstances of the undersigned and his wife, there was no need to delve into it deeply. Therefore, in addition to waiving the previous debt of 800 yuan, he also generously helped to maintain the living and old-age expenses, totaling 7,000 yuan. His high friendship is appreciated. Hereafter, the undersigned, etc., will never make any unreasonable demands from Mr. Wu or borrow any more points. In addition to requesting the withdrawal of the complaint from the French Court, the certificate will also be sent to the French court for registration, etc., May 1929, written by Ren Chunfeng and Ren Zhou, witnessing lawyers Xu Yannian and Shen Yushan. After reading it, Judge Qu passed it on to the lawyer representing the petitioner to read. Judge Qu ruled that the mediation between the two parties was unsuccessful and ordered that another lawsuit be filed.</p>
<h3>The Drugstore Employee Committed the Murder Not for Money but for Lust</h3>
<p>▲ Teasing Two Girls in the Attic Room</p>
<p>▲ Feeling Uncomfortable, He Took This Action</p>
<p>Xu Guozhang, a native of Changzhou who was an employee of the Dunhetang Pharmacy at number 1039 Dongyouheng Road, broke into the bedroom of the shop owner, Ma Youzhi, drunk at midnight on the 8th of this month. He used a medicine-cutting knife to slash Ma in the head, chest, back, and other parts, causing injuries. Ma called for help, and Chinese constable number 1168, who was on guard duty outside, heard the alarm, broke down the door, captured Xu, and took him and the murder weapon to the Huishan Police Station, and escorted him to the First Special District Court for interrogation and custody. This has been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xiufen came to the Third Criminal Court to continue the interrogation. Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, stated the case and said that there were three witnesses in court today to be interrogated. According to Xu Mingde's testimony, he had been working with the defendant for only a few months. He joined the store after the Dragon Boat Festival. He did not drink sorghum liquor with him that night. Moreover, he is a believer in the religion and does not drink alcohol on weekdays. At that time, I was sleeping and was awakened by the shouting for help of the shop owner, Ma Youzhi. He ran to Ma's bedroom to see what was going on, and the defendant had already been arrested by the Chinese constable, he said. Chen Cai and Chen Ruibao, two sisters from Shaoxing who lived in the attic room of the store, testified one after another that they wove silk in a silk factory, left early and returned late, and had no ambiguous relationship with either the plaintiff or the defendant. They did not know what the defendant had injured the shop owner, Ma. Ma Youzhi said that the defendant had seen that he had 500 yuan in income, but this amount had already been paid to the medicine store. He only had 88 yuan in cash with him when he committed the murder that night. He thought that the reason for his intention to harm him was for money. The defendant firmly stated that it was not for money but for the opinion of the two girls in the attic room. Although he had no illicit relationship with Chen Cai, he used to be intimate with her. Recently, Ma Dongjia often went to the attic room with his nephew to tease the two girls, which made him feel very uncomfortable. Therefore, he bought Gao Su with beef that night, ate and drank heavily, and could not control himself, causing this disaster, as if in a dream, etc., please see. The police lawyer Zhang also said that the facts of this case are not related to money but to lust. It is obvious. Please punish him according to the law. After Judge Xiao checked the confession, he ordered the defendant's agent, Lawyer Ge, to argue, and ordered him to be returned to custody for sentencing on a scheduled date.</p>
<h3>The Madman Speaks Nonsense</h3>
<p>What He Says Is Laughable</p>
<p>The madman Qi Jiaquan stole a large bundle of lead sheets at the North Station yesterday morning and hired Wei Guozhang's rickshaw to drive away, but was arrested by the traffic police and escorted to the District Court. When the prosecutor opened a court for preliminary review, Qi spoke incoherently, saying that he was from Zhoupu, Nanhui, and his father was the director of the Nanjing Law School, and he himself graduated from the Nanhui Law School and then went abroad to study, graduating from the University of Berlin in Germany, the London Shipping School, and the University of Paris in France. After that, he traveled around the world to 53 countries. My diplomas are all at the station. These lead sheets, a total of more than ten bundles, belong to my relatives, so I took a bundle. But I am the son of an official family, and my relatives are all commanders and celebrities, which makes people laugh when they hear it. The prosecutor, considering that he was such a madman, ordered him to be sent to a mental hospital for treatment before further investigation.</p>
<p>Wife addicted to Gambling and Missing</p>
<h3>Husband Scouts in All Directions</h3>
<p>The wife of Mr. Zhou at number 41 Yuancheng Lane, Rue Lafayette in the French Concession, is addicted to gambling. Recently, she has been losing repeatedly, reaching more than ten thousand. The day before yesterday, her husband found out and reprimanded her severely. One party became angry and ashamed, and a quarrel broke out, with harsh words exchanged. Mr. and Mrs. Zhou have always been affectionate, and this is the first time in more than ten years. Later, Mr. Zhou's wife was still angry and left everything behind. She has not returned yet. Now Mr. Zhou is repentant and is scouting in all directions, hoping to return home soon, etc.</p>
<h3>Minutes of the Municipal Council Meeting</h3>
<p>The Public Concession Municipal Council issued the situation of the board meeting at 4:30 PM on the 16th. (1) Staffing of the Public Information Office: The chairman stated that the Japanese news publicist has been selected by the Japanese director, and the Chinese news publicist will also be selected by the Chinese director in the near future. (2) Land Committee Quota: The Chinese director will raise his opinions at the next meeting. (3) Refugee Issues: The chairman reported that the director of the Engineering Department has drafted a plan for the shelter, estimating that it will cost 100,000 yuan. Now he has received a letter from Hu Hongji, director of the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau, stating that the establishment of the shelter is not urgent at present. The bureau has instructed the police department to ask the Shanghai municipal authorities to notify them in advance when disaster victims come to Shanghai at the request of the Health Department. (4) Addition of a Japanese Assistant General Manager to the General Manager's Office: A director stated that the number of Japanese residents in Shanghai is the largest among foreigners, and there is no senior administrative officer to connect the Municipal Council and the overseas Chinese. Therefore, he strives to add a Japanese Assistant General Manager. However, the selection of personnel needs to be carefully considered, so it will not be launched immediately, only seeking to pass the principle first. After some discussion by the directors, (5) Rice Purchase Funds: The Social Bureau wrote to the Municipal Council to request a donation of rice funds for disaster victims arriving in Shanghai. The chairman proposed to transfer the remaining 20,000 yuan from last year's purchase of low-priced rice. All the directors unanimously agreed. (6) Issues Concerning the Implementation of the Factory Law in the Concession: After circulating the police department's report, the directors discussed it briefly and decided that since the factory owners did not object to the Social Bureau staff going to inspect, the Municipal Council should not object either. The police department can be immediately informed that the police station does not need to intervene.</p>

<h3>Reader Correspondence - Mr. So-and-So's Inquiry</h3>
<p>Thirteen years ago, I received some primary school education in my hometown. Unfortunately, I was forced by circumstances to drift into society and engage in pickpocketing. I did this on the British, American, and French trams in Shanghai, as well as on long-distance public transportation, both with and without rails, to steal money from passengers to make a living. I have twelve or thirteen years of experience in Shanghai. I have seen countless techniques and amounts of money, but it all goes to gambling and waste. I often feel that this way of life is not suitable for my legitimate business and has no end. If I make a mistake, I will inevitably be imprisoned and suffer invisible pain. I really don't want to continue. Therefore, I am determined to eradicate the pickpocketing business and change to a real industry, but I am having trouble entering the door of legitimate work. Now, after reading a news item about employment issues, I know it can solve various problems of employment, unemployment, and career change. Therefore, I earnestly request you to point out a legitimate path so that I can possibly see the light of day again.</p>
<p>(Reply) After reading your letter, I feel both respect and pity for you. There is no need to elaborate on this feeling. Being able to change after making mistakes is the highest virtue. Moreover, since you are an educated person, you are compelled to do this, and it must be due to environmental pressures. Strictly speaking, society should also bear part of the responsibility and cannot completely blame you. As for industries you can change to, there are many paths. With your education, keen mind, lively methods, and spirit of enduring hardship, you can definitely find a small service job. Even if the income is less, the job is stable, and your conscience is clear. By being frugal, you can maintain integrity. You said that the previous income was just for gambling and waste. Now that you realize it is wrong and are able to quit, it will naturally be enough. As for the previous history, it is certainly not a glorious page, but after changing, there is no need to feel guilty. During the Xianfeng and Tongzhi periods of the Qing Dynasty, there was a notorious thief in Hunan named Luo Siju, who committed numerous crimes. Later, he joined Zeng's army, repeatedly performed military exploits, and was promoted to the position of admiral. As an official, he was as clean as water and loved the people like his own children. Local people all loved and respected him. After his death, there was even a posthumous ceremony. When he was in office, he personally wrote to various prefectures and counties, ordering that all the cases he had committed before and had not been solved be canceled, and even if it was clear that he had done it himself, it should not be pursued further. At that time, his superiors and colleagues did not discriminate against him because of this, and one colleague even asked him in public. He said, "Siju was a thief and is now an official, but you gentlemen are officials and are still thieves." Carefully consider these words, and you will surely be able to understand. As for asking where to find a legitimate job, you may need to ask friends widely and pay attention to opportunities. However, you should first make a determination. I sincerely advise you to quickly be driven by your conscience, be determined to change careers, and wish you success in your future development.</p>
<h3>Mr. Jiang Xiufeng's Inquiry</h3>
<p>I am currently an employee of a shop, and the income I earn is enough to maintain the household expenses and my own legitimate expenses. However, since the incident of the massacre of overseas Chinese, business has been invisibly sluggish. Now the company is also affected by this and will soon be closed. The gold mine that I rely on to maintain my livelihood will sink with the stone. If I continue to seek a living here, it is not impossible, but it is only a temporary solution and not a long-term plan. Therefore, I want to return to my motherland and seek a permanent business, but I have no way to knock on the door. My decision is to return to the three northeastern provinces, but this move not only has no way to enter, but I also hear that the business in the eastern provinces is very depressed due to the poor economy, and there are unemployed people everywhere. Therefore, my firm intention has returned to hesitation. However, for the sake of my family's livelihood, I have to plan ahead. If it is just a personal problem, it is easier to solve. Based on my experience, making a living is a small matter and should not be a problem. It is just that it is difficult to support those who are waiting to be fed. More than half of the overseas Chinese in Korea have returned after being massacred, and those who cannot return suddenly are mostly facing the above-mentioned difficulties. It is not just me who is like this. Your newspaper has a heart to save the knots of society. I hope you will solve the above-mentioned difficult problems on behalf of the newspaper. My gratitude is beyond words. I believe that overseas Chinese who are facing the same difficulties are also grateful. (Omission below)</p>
<p>(Reply) After reading your letter, I express my infinite sympathy for you and for the general Korean compatriots. I am very willing to do my best with my meager intelligence and ability to help you and the general compatriots. Unfortunately, there is very little practical contribution. For your personal consideration, there are many hopes for the future. Although the business in the eastern provinces is not prosperous, with your rich experience and considerable funds, there is definitely room for development. What we dare to assert is that for the general compatriots, if the public all return to the country, we dare not say whether there will be a way to live. Moreover, from the perspective of the country, as a national, we should always develop outwards. Moreover, we have been overseas for a long time, and we have a considerable foundation in our careers. Once the public abandon it and return, both individuals and the country will suffer great losses. This matter should be carefully considered. What we can answer is only this.</p>
<p>At the end of the letter, another question, we believe that loyalty to the country does not necessarily require any title or status. I think you understand this meaning.</p>
<h3>Mr. Wang Zuxuan's Inquiry</h3>
<p>Since your newspaper added reader correspondence, I believe your newspaper will solve many more questions for readers in the future. Like many other readers, I thank you for this and hope your newspaper will continue to work hard. Chinese education has always been biased towards empty talk and not practical. In other words, it is education that does not focus on production. So, as a result, it only produces a batch of scholars who are too weak to truss a chicken, who only know how to consume but do not engage in production. Today, education has almost reached the point of bankruptcy. China's backwardness in production is a phenomenon that should not have happened. China is in a semi-colonial position, so it has become a playground for the goods of imperialist countries. Taking Shanghai as an example, factories and shops are everywhere, and are they not filled with the economic power of foreigners? Conversely, what is the situation in China now? Every business is either at the mercy of foreigners or has no vigorous atmosphere. Therefore, in the business world, foreign firms need compradores, salesmen, and trainees who can type and speak English to help promote foreign goods. On the Chinese side, however, there are more monks than porridge, and there is no room to insert a foot. State-owned factories and shops not only have no new atmosphere, but those that are bankrupt are bankrupt, and those that are not bankrupt are also struggling. Under this situation, the general public is chanting the tune of "professionalizing education" or "promoting vocational education." This makes me unable to generate the following doubts: (1) "The neighbor is rich, and I am poor." The stronger the foreign economy is in China, the weaker the Chinese economy is. Those who promote vocational education, when the iron fist of the foreign economy surrounds China, want to create many running dogs of foreign firms to promote foreign goods, destroy the Chinese economy, and put our people to death as soon as possible, isn't it? (2) I want to make Chinese production developed and the economy transformed. It is definitely not possible to make up for the overall situation by creating a few professional talents, because what China fundamentally lacks is jobs, not professional talents, isn't it? (3) Judging from the above two points, promoting vocational education, like other education, is not scratching where it itches, and is of no benefit, or even harmful. (They often take Europe, America, and Japan as examples, but they do not know that the societies of Europe, America, and Japan are fundamentally different from China.) I am a student who has received secondary education (what I received is also vocational education), and I am now in a state of unemployment. On the one hand, I am sad for myself, and on the other hand, I am panicked for the majority of young people. I hope your newspaper will give a satisfactory answer to the above doubts and hope to publish it in your newspaper to give a guidance to the majority of young people, thank you.</p>
<p>(Reply) You have observed the current society deeply and correctly, and we admire it very much. However, regarding the three questions you raised, we have some differences in our views.</p>
<p>(1) Vocational education is to teach people the knowledge and skills of life, and at the same time, it should also focus on personality. What you said about creating running dogs of foreign firms and promoting foreign goods, etc., probably because you saw that many people in the foreign goods industry have studied commerce, can speak foreign languages, and type foreign words, and thus suspect that commercial schools have these kinds of courses, that is, the only purpose is to create such personnel who serve foreign firms. In fact, this is not the case. Commercial schools teach people to speak foreign languages and type foreign words, but they do not teach people to speak and type for foreigners. If we believe that speaking and typing for foreigners is not right, then it is the same as a person getting sick because of overeating or uncleanliness, and suspecting that giving people food is harmful. Do you think this makes sense? Moreover, there are many kinds of vocational education, and commercial education is just one of them. (3) Speaking of China fundamentally lacking jobs, not professional talents, you probably see that the current hundred industries are not prosperous, and even if there are talents, I am afraid they are useless. This sentence cannot be said to be completely without reason, but if you want to develop a hundred industries, can you develop without talents? The current problem is still that the talents created do not meet the needs. Please see that many places need specialized talents, and they have not been found so far. Wasn't it reported in the newspaper yesterday that the Ministry of Education approved the Ministry of Railways' request to issue a notice to cultivate civil engineering specialists to meet the needs? (3) Speaking of promoting vocational education, like other education, it does not scratch where it itches. This sentence is very pertinent. Originally, vocational education, and even general education, should be based on adapting to needs. It is absolutely impossible to see what foreign countries need and think that China has the same needs. This is a major reason for the failure of education today.</p>
<p>Therefore, those who run vocational education and those who receive vocational education should pay attention to the needs of society.</p>

<h3>Southeast Entrance of Confucius Channel Waterway Police Float Changes</h3>
<p>Customs Marine Division Inspection Department No. 1011 Announcement: The Marine Department of this Inspection Department has investigated the changes in the police float at the southeast entrance of the Confucius Channel Waterway within the boundary of the Jianghai Customs Tax Department. The situation and trend are listed on the left. Because the shoal on the north side of the navigation channel about 1.8 nautical miles east-southeast of the East Entrance Float of the Baimaosha South Waterway has increased southward, it will change the Southeast Entrance Police Float of the Confucius Channel Waterway as follows around September 25 of this year. It will be implemented at that time and will not be notified again. (1) A new gas light float is set up, decorated in red and named Bridge Float, with a white, intermittent light on top, flashing once every eight seconds, that is, light for four seconds and extinguished for four seconds, which is to indicate the north side of the navigation channel, from the float to the Biandansha stake, which is north 9 degrees and one-quarter west, 6 nautical miles away. All upstream vessels passing through the area must be on the left side of the float. (1) The East Entrance Float of the Baimaosha South Waterway is changed to black without light, and the float remains in its original position. (1) The Baimaosha East Corner Lower Float moves the azimuth, from the new moving location, to the Biandansha stake, which is north 65 degrees and three-quarters east, 2.7 nautical miles away. The rest of the situation remains the same. Now the waterway between the Bridge Float and the East Entrance Float is narrow. All vessels passing through the area must be careful and cautious. All the degrees listed above are based on the compass direction. Refer to Chinese Navy Hydrographic Chart No. 141 for clarity. The Marine Department of this Inspection Department hereby announces to all vessels that they must pay attention to and record it carefully to avoid negligence.

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the esteemed Editor of Shen Bao: Respectfully, our firm, entrusted by the Shantou Committee for Raising Funds for the Wuhan and Other Regions Flood Disaster Relief, remitted 20,000 yuan to the Hankou Chamber of Commerce for disaster relief. This was done on the 14th through our associated firm, Dingsheng Zhuang, which paid the Bank of Communications the full amount for remittance. This was already acknowledged in the third announcement column of the Hubei Association of Fellow Provincials in Shanghai for Raising Emergency Relief Funds for the Flood Disaster in Hubei Province in the Xinwen Bao on the 15th. Yesterday (17th), I read on page 4 of the first section of your newspaper, regarding the Shantou Chamber of Commerce raising funds for the Wuhan flood disaster, the sentence "First remitted 10,000 yuan, delivered to Shanghai Dingfeng." The difference of 10,000 yuan is likely a mistake in reporting. I am sending this special letter to you to request a correction, to avoid misunderstandings among outsiders. This is my earnest hope and request. With best wishes, Dingsheng Exchange House, September 18th.</p>

<h3>Writing</h3>
<p>Han Zilao said:</p>
<p>"A large brush can write small characters, but a small brush cannot write large characters."</p>
<p>Xiao Fu disagreed, he said:</p>
<p>"To write large characters, one must use a large brush; to write small characters, one must use a small brush. A large brush cannot write small characters, just as a small brush cannot write large characters."</p>
<p>I think both of them are right, it's just that their perspectives are different. What Xiao Fu said is a prescription for those who employ people: if great talent is used for small tasks, then small talent will naturally be used for great tasks, even exclusively; if small talent is used for great tasks, then great talent will naturally be used for small tasks, even to the point of being useless. Those who have been entrusted by society with the power to employ people, causing many people to be misplaced, wouldn't that be terrible! What Zilao said is intended as a rule for self-discipline. If one has great talent, one must do great things, and one must immediately do great things, not willing to start from small things, then one cannot help but have resentment in one's heart, and one also lacks a solid foundation in experience. How can one not seek greatness and end up seeing one's smallness?</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of Zhang Qian, the Elder</h3>
<p>— Yin Shouman</p>
<p>Zhang Qian of Nantong. Originally named Yucai, courtesy name Shuren. He changed his name to Qian only in Dingchou (the third year of the Guangxu reign). Courtesy name Jizhi. (Zhou Yansheng sent him a poem on the change of name) He was close friends with Shu Weihuang of Yangzhou, Zhu Manjun of Taixing, Gu Xijue of Rugao, Zhou Yansheng of Haimen, etc. All were famous in their hometowns for their literary talent. They were known at the time as the Five Talents of Jiangbei. Later, Zhang gradually became prominent, while the others were unsuccessful. But their friendship never changed because of his prominence or their misfortune. One day, Gu Xijue was passing through Tongcheng by boat, but he was eager to return home, so he passed Zhang's gate without entering. When Zhang heard of this, he rushed to Tangzha (16 li from the city) and finally met him. They boarded the boat and chatted happily. They cherished each other and parted at dusk.</p>
<p>Elder Zhang's literary knowledge was admired by the world, and his treatment of people was especially kind and approachable. Therefore, the local people still sing his praises. I remember one time, Zhang was returning home from a banquet at the residence of a gentleman in the south of the city. It was already dusk. Because the rickshaw he was riding in did not have lights, he was stopped by a guard near Wangxian Bridge, who said that according to the law, he had to be fined four jiao. The rickshaw puller was about to argue, but Zhang quickly stopped him, took out four small silver coins from his pocket, and gave them to the guard. Afterwards, someone who knew Zhang said to the guard, "This is Mr. Zhang. How dare you fine him?" The guard was terrified when he heard this, thinking that he would definitely be severely punished. Unexpectedly, the next day, the police station suddenly received a letter from Zhang, highly praising the guard's ability to enforce the law without showing any leniency, and awarded him two yuan. I say that the guard's ability to enforce the law is not surprising, but Zhang's commitment to upholding the law himself is commendable.</p>
<h3>World Anecdotes</h3>
<p>Newly Invented Special Alarm Clock: All working people are bound by their duties and must get up early. But sometimes they sleep so soundly that they cannot get up on time. Therefore, they have to put an alarm clock by their pillow. But the alarm clock is too loud and often wakes up other people's dreams. Recently, in England, someone invented a special new alarm clock that combines a clock and a phonograph. When the set time arrives, the record on the phonograph will automatically start playing a song that urges people to get up. Even the deepest sleeper will wake up.</p>
<p>Snails as a Delicacy: People in Guangdong, China, eat snakes, cats, and honey rats, which everyone thinks are strange things. Then the French regard snails as a delicacy, which must also be considered a miracle. It is said that these snails are completely different from ordinary snails. Their food is lettuce and grape leaves, so they are very clean and plump. The price is very expensive. They can only be eaten at the highest-class banquets. Ordinary meals definitely do not have this. The upper class in England has also recently enjoyed eating snails. More than two million snails are imported into London from France every year.

<h3>Interesting Stories of Preventing Floods in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Rui Hongchu</p>
<p>Since the rumor of a great flood of twelve feet in Shanghai spread, the general residents were worried. It has been raining intermittently in recent days, so those with simple minds are even more panicked. People say that Shanghai is the most civilized city in the country. Who knows that Shanghai's superstition is also not inferior? It's truly laughable. Here are some interesting stories about flood prevention that I have heard and seen in the past few days.</p>
<p>Oil and Rice Industry Profits Triple: In the past few days in this city, such as oil, rice, soy sauce, wine, and coal, have been affected by the flood rumors. Residents are rushing to buy them in advance. Therefore, all industries have tripled their profits. It is said that the oil and rice industry is the most profitable.</p>
<p>Suitcase Used as Rice Bucket: In Xueyuan Lane, Jing'an Temple Road, there is a young couple from Wuxi. Because the husband is currently working in a certain bank in Shanghai, this spring in February, they specially rented a room in the lane. The couple are very affectionate and can't bear to leave each other for a moment. When this bad rumor spread, they saw that their neighbors were all buying grain to prepare for the disaster. So yesterday they also sent a shi of rice home. But their luggage is simple, and they lack a place to store it. As a result, they took out all their clothes and put the rice in their suitcases. The wife told people, "You guys are making me dizzy, I can't think of anything."</p>
<p>Seventy-Year-Old Man Learns to Swim: In a certain cigarette and paper store in Xiaodongmen, there is an old man who is over seventy years old. He has never known how to swim in his life, and he also doesn't like to swim. Recently, he suddenly changed his attitude and is learning the art of swimming. It is said that the old man is also affected by the flood rumors.</p>
<p>Years of Feuds Suddenly Disappear: Across from my residence, upstairs is a family surnamed Huang, and downstairs is a family surnamed Wu. They have lived together for nearly three years. Last May, Huang was involved in a lawsuit for owing Wu money. Since then, the two families have not communicated with each other. At the end of August this year, the woman surnamed Wu downstairs suddenly gave Huang a large gift, very diligently, insisting that Huang accept it. At that time, Huang didn't understand. It wasn't until the beginning of this month that Wu's family successively asked Huang to store all their precious clothes, boxes, and cages. Huang, at this point, finally understood Wu's sudden goodwill. It was also due to the impact of preventing floods.</p>
<h3>Please Order the Cessation of Qiantang Tidal Bore Viewing</h3>
<p>— Bu Jushi</p>
<p>The tides of Zhejiang have been a disaster since ancient times. I have never heard of them being regarded as an optimistic view. Under the old system of the Qing Dynasty, Zhejiang set up three defense deputy magistrates in the east, central, and west, who were responsible for managing sections and specialized in governing embankments. The governors and viceroys would inspect the embankments from time to time to see if they were stable and whether there were stockpiles of firewood and wood and stone. They would then demote, promote, or dismiss them. When the autumn flood came, they were careful to prevent erosion before the tide rose, and after the tide receded, they would quickly repair the work patrols. They were always anxious and afraid of the sudden arrival of the raging tide. Since the past ten years, there has been a grand event of watching the Qiantang tidal bore. Even the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway has opened special trains, and the local area of Haining has set up hostels. Carriages and horses are crowded, and it only stops after a few days. Public and private expenses are in the millions. In times of peace and prosperity, traveling together and seeking strange sights is still criticized by those who cherish their time. When speaking of the Zhejiang tide today, I am afraid there is no time to watch, no heart to watch, or even dare not watch.</p>
<p>In recent years, the bandit disasters have been rampant and the military affairs have been heavy, almost without a day to spare. Now, with internal worries unresolved and external troubles deepening, this is the time when the authorities should be ready for battle. Moreover, natural disasters are prevalent and have affected sixteen provinces. The government is eagerly planning to transport food and relieve the flood. Virtuous and heroic people are gathering in Shanghai and other provinces to discuss disaster relief. Women and children are going to all walks of life to solicit donations. This is also a time when the whole country is panicking, unable to eat well or sleep peacefully. Now, if soldiers release their military uniforms, politicians stop their plans, and scholars do not care about the consequences and engage in sightseeing, that is what I mean by "no time to watch."</p>
<p>Today, those who are submerged in the flood and waiting for their fate are most severely affected in the three towns of Wuhan in Hubei and the various districts of Gaobao in Jiangsu. This is the essence of the country, the source of fish, rice, wealth, and taxes. If you take a look at the plight of the victims and the tragic pictures of the flooded areas, no one would not be moved to tears. They regard the floods as a terrible disaster, and we regard the huge tides as a spectacle. With a little bit of humanity, how can we open our eyes? That is what I mean by "no heart to watch."</p>
<p>Recently, rumors have been circulating in Shanghai that a large tide will come in the middle of August. This is an unfounded statement. However, according to history, the Zhejiang Sea has often overflowed. The most serious case was in the third year of Guanghua in the Tang Dynasty, when the sea overflowed and destroyed people's homes. In July of the first year of Chunxi in the Song Dynasty, there was a great storm in Qiantang, which broke the embankment for more than 1,600 zhang, drifting away more than 630 homes. During the Ming Dynasty, there were six incidents of sea dikes collapsing. In the early years of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty, the dike was eroded, almost leading to a major collapse. The Zhejiang Governor requested an allocation of six million taels of national silver, and all the embankments along the coast were built with huge stones, supplemented by sloping firewood embankments. There were no floods for decades. However, there were constant expenses for adding firewood and setting up barriers every year. Now that the embankment project has withdrawn its special commissioner, it is unknown what preparations have been made by the coast. In the event of a tidal surge coinciding with a hurricane, even if it does not affect various districts, how can the tide viewers have a foothold? That is what I mean by "dare not watch."</p>
<p>But I must request an explicit order to stop it. The act of tide watching has become a habit in recent years. Outside Haining, the sightseeing places, the wine and food shops, and the vendors selling miscellaneous items gather to seek short-term profits. The railway bureau allocates special passenger cars to rush to the destination, and there are also peddlers who follow back and forth. If the travelers wrap their feet, and the residents waste their money, it is not to be kind to people or cherish material resources. Just order the road bureau to stop the tide-watching special train, and they will announce it in the newspaper, and the local area will naturally stop its preparations. And let the general public know that the government is advocating that its subordinates wholeheartedly focus on disaster relief and pacification. When the wind blows, the grass bends, and everyone will abolish banquets and be frugal and diligent. Then China will be close to recovering.</p>
<p>Publishing News: Zhang Junzhenlu has edited a kind of literary periodical, named "Ten Day Report". The content emphasizes both literature and art, and is oriented towards art. The inaugural issue is published today. It is sold by newspaper vendors. The annual subscription fee including postage is sixty cents. Those who send a postal request for the inaugural issue to the Ten Day Report Office, No. 676 Beijing Road, will not be charged any fee.</p>
<h3>Miscellanea from Japan</h3>
<p>— Ai Ai, sent from Tokyo</p>
<p>The Magic of the Coffee Waitress (Continued)</p>
<p>Whether a coffee shop's business is flourishing or not does not depend on whether it can make exquisite snacks, or whether its coffee is brewed thick enough. Its fate is entirely tied to these mysterious waitresses. The waitress who is often praised and welcomed by customers has a special talent. She can bring the coffee she is holding to Customer A's mouth, while talking to Customer B, and at the same time take care of Customer C and Customer D with her flexible eyes and dark, affectionate eyes. Customer C and Customer D are both a little unnatural, as if they have been shocked. Even those customers who are sitting a little further away, those customers who can only see the waitress's back, are also expressing their goodwill because of her light figure, curved waist, and elastic buttocks. In short, the waitresses' slight and ordinary actions are like a stone thrown into a pool of clear water. It will expand into countless circles and win the admiration of the entire room. The waitresses are very smart. When they see the excited emotions of the customers, they are especially affected. They sing charming little songs and express extraordinary tenderness. They will say things that ordinary girls cannot say. They make laughs that ordinary girls cannot make. Their slight anger, feigned shyness, a frown, a smile, everything about them satisfies, intoxicates, and captivates the customers.</p>
<p>This is a question. Don't scholars who study Japanese national character say that the Japanese are very impatient? What about those vigorous young men? But from the perspective of coffee shops, they are simply a flock of sheep raised by those waitresses. They slowly drink the coffee contained in a small glass that is less than five inches long, which they receive from the slender hands of those enchanting waitresses. They drink it in more than ten sips. The spring stools in the coffee shop have been sat on by customers for a long time and are a little tilted. Oh, waitresses with magic!</p>
<p>Tales of the Rotary Club</p>
<h3>The Husband's Wife (17)</h3>
<p>— Jiang Hongjiao</p>
<p>But they honestly went out together. After they left, Mr. Chen sat alone in boredom, feeling that his wife was not only not managing the house, but also going out and coming in with Mr. Li every day, which was really inappropriate. Before he got married, he hoped to get a wife who was good at socializing, and it was not necessary for his wife to take care of the chores at home. Now he already feels that this idea is completely wrong. He has noticed that Mr. Li has been too close to his wife recently, regardless of etiquette. It is rare for a man to stand in front of his friend's wife's bed and watch her get up in only a sleeping gown. Thinking of this, he hates Mr. Li for bullying him too much. He is preparing to find another house to move into and separate from the Li family. He is preparing to break off relations with Mr. Li and never interact with him again. He is preparing to get a suitable opportunity to announce Mr. Li's immorality in front of many friends, so that he will be punished in terms of reputation. But he also thought that Mrs. Li has also been very close to me recently. It is also immoral for me not to refuse her. Our sins are exactly equal. He couldn't help but laugh.</p>
<p>So he warned himself not to increase the degree of intimacy with Mrs. Li. She is certainly very pitiful now, not getting her husband's love, but in case Mr. Li changes his mind and loves her, she will certainly love her husband too. Then I will definitely get an empty dream and only increase some sadness. Otherwise, her husband will never love her, she loves me, and I also love her, but I have my wife and can never let people know this secret. If my wife knows, it will be easier to cause a huge disturbance. Now, my wife may not have done anything to betray me. She only loves to play and is unwilling to manage the house. I should advise her well, so that she can be quiet and gradually take back her heart. Maybe she will still be a very good wife? He thought more forgivingly, believing that the environment in Shanghai was enough to push women to luxury, laziness, and comfort, and it was by no means the sin of his wife alone. Mrs. Li's diligence and thrift, not being pushed and pulled by the Shanghai environment, is an exception. Mrs. Li is certainly a respectable and lovable person, but she already has a husband. I love her, I will keep it in my stomach and know it myself, and never show it to her again. This is my trial period for my personality, and it is also a dangerous product for my reputation. If I don't pay attention, it may develop into a major tragedy. He thought that from today onwards, he would gradually distance himself from her and reduce the opportunities to approach and talk.</p>

<h3>Strong Rise in Financial and Gold Markets</h3>
<p>Surged Eight Liang and Six Qian: Yesterday, the gold price suddenly rose sharply. The trend was good. It was said to be a large increase with small retracements, with a difference of only one or two liang in the intraday trading. The difference between the morning and afternoon sessions was more than seven liang. People were bullish. The demand of each firm exceeded the supply. Overseas silver market reported a drop, so it opened high. In the future, both official and unofficial exchange rates will be tight. Fellow traders are rushing to settle contracts. Especially because of rumors from foreign telegrams that silver bars are about to fall again, the short sellers were eager to cover their positions. Also, because Chengfeng Yong, Yongheng Luo, Hengxing Yuan, Lu, etc., were excited and competing to buy, British gold weakened, and 1 shilling, 2 pence, and 9375 were not easy to obtain. Later, 875 were available for delivery. As a result, the gold price felt even sharper. It once broke through the 780 liang mark. The soft decline in the afternoon was due to many parties selling off. Exchange rates seemed firm, but had retraced to within 80 liang. Afterwards, it eased slightly.</p>
<p>Morning Session Rose Steadily: The November opening price in the morning session increased by 4 liang and 7 qian, to 775 liang and 4 qian. Large silver bars fell by 1/8 to 1/16.

British gold for October was 9375, both buying and selling could be transacted. Soon after, December was also 9375. When British gold was announced, Chunyuan Yong, etc., sold out, so it was reduced to 6 liang and 67 qian. The listed price has been reduced by 125, American gold 25, Japanese gold increased by 1 1/2 fen, but it was not affected. In fact, internally, it was still settled at 9375. In a moment, it increased to 7 liang and a half, and then to 6 liang and 2 qian. After 9:30, it hovered around 77 liang, with a slight swing of 1 liang. Later, after 10 o'clock, news was heard that the silver market was bearish, and people's hearts were excited. So Chengda Yong, Chengfeng Yong, Fuxing Yong, Hengxing Yuan, Tongtaichang Yongheng, etc., rose like a storm, striving to buy. British gold became tight. Those who settled contracts were tireless. Until 11:00, Linghua Bank, etc., sold 875, and the price went up all the way, breaking through 80 liang, a total increase of 5 liang. However, there was only a 1 liang retracement in between.

The listed price was changed to 797 liang and 4 qian, discounted 20 to 16 liang.</p>
<p>Afternoon Session Turned Relaxed: The afternoon session opened at 78 liang and 8 qian, following the momentum after the noon closing. Next was 9 liang and a half. Soon after, Yuancheng Yong Cuichang Yong Yongfeng Tongtaichang, etc., sold off one after another, dropping 2 liang. At 2:45, it was 77 liang and 7 qian. Afterwards, there was a slight advance and retreat of one liang. After 3 o'clock, Tongtaichang bought again. Xinheng bought in the Indian exchange rate for less than one anna, so it rose to 9 liang and 3 qian. Suddenly, I heard that HSBC was releasing January British gold at 9375.

<h3>Consolidated Tax and Salt Tax Suddenly Rose by 1.56 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's securities exchange market saw no spot transactions and only moderate futures transactions. Aside from significant movements in important bonds, the market was relatively quiet. The trend for bond prices remained in a fluctuating state. Since the start of the week, the bond market environment had been dull, market sentiment was uncertain, and fluctuations were chaotic, with no consistent trend. Yesterday, bond prices rebounded because there weren't large sellers, and small investors were enthusiastically buying.

<h3>Yarn &amp; Cotton: Major Yarn Market Players Covering Short Positions</h3>
<p>The yarn market has turned firm, showing an upward trend, due to major players covering their short positions. This has buoyed market sentiment, and actual sales are also increasing. Various firms are seeing sporadic transactions, so confidence is rising, and market prices have slightly increased. However, overseas cotton markets remain weak, so Japanese firms are still selling, and their accumulated positions are growing, creating significant pressure. As a result, the market hasn't seen a dramatic increase.</p>
<p>Man-Marked Good Two Outsides: The opening of the market for man-marked goods saw the covering of short positions for the current month, causing market prices to trend upward. Distant months were dragged along, with increases of 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, and 0.07 qian. In the afternoon, it was reported that spot sales were good, and all months increased again by 0.04, 0.06, and 0.07 qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 30,200 bales. Sales included 2,150 bales from Tongyu, 800 bales from Taixing, 900 bales from Shenchang, 550 bales from Houfeng, 700 bales from Shenda, and 500 bales from Gongtai. Purchases included 1,150 bales from Tianlong, 800 bales from Mingde, 1,400 bales from Shenji, and 1,400 bales from Changfeng. The closing prices are recorded below, along with the number of open positions.</p>

<h3>Cotton Market Buoyed by Yarn</h3>
<p>Cotton Market Slightly Up: Due to stable gold prices and a lively yarn market, sentiment is firm. However, the situation for foreign cotton remains weak, and factories are purchasing foreign cotton, halting domestic cotton transactions. As a result, major players still have strong selling intentions, but cotton merchants are maintaining their long positions and not loosening their grip.</p>
<p>Hankou Cotton Slightly Up by 0.02-0.03 qian: The opening of the Hankou cotton market saw a slight decline in foreign cotton, and sentiment remained soft. Later, due to the good yarn market, it rose by 0.05 fen. In the afternoon, with the yarn market rising, all months also increased by 0.02 qian, 0.015 qian. Total transactions amounted to 51,900 dan.

<h3>U.S. Cotton Acreage Reduction Movement</h3>
<p>Austin, Texas, 17th: The Texas House of Representatives has passed a bill to reduce cotton acreage by two-thirds next year. The Senate supports reducing it by three-quarters. Southern states generally agree to the reduction, but they are waiting for Texas to initiate it, as Texas's production accounts for one-third of the U.S. total.</p>
<h3>Foreign Yarn and Cotton Show No Improvement</h3>
<p>American, British, and Indian Cotton All Decline: Yesterday, U.S. cotton initially weakened due to Southern sales, but then firmed due to short covering and strength on Wall Street. Futures prices fell by 0.03-0.05 British pounds and spot prices by 0.05 British pounds. British cotton futures fell by 0.06-0.08 points and spot prices by 0.16 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 0.15 points. Indian cotton market conditions were weak, with Pingguore falling by 1.25 rupees, and Aomula and Bairoxi falling by 2 rupees.

<h3>Grains: New Grain Enters the Market, Prices Drop by 0.5-0.6 Yuan</h3>
<p>Southern Market: The rice market entered a state of weakness again yesterday. Due to a steady stream of supply, continuous cloudy weather couldn't boost demand. Sales in urban and rural shops were slow, and transactions were minimal. Merchants were selling at discounted prices. Thick粳 (jīng) rice prices fell by 0.3 yuan. 薄稻 (báo dào, thin rice) was continuously arriving from Songhang, and its price was lower, making it difficult to sell. Its price also fell by 0.3-0.4 yuan. The prices of thick and thin broken粳 (jīng) rice remained unchanged in stores. It would be difficult for the market to turn around before the Mid-Autumn Festival. Luyang premium goods were still selling sporadically and slowly. Market conditions followed the weakness. New Luyang premium goods entered the market, arriving from Beiji, Lili, Xitang, and Taozhuang. Because they were released near noon, prices dropped by 0.5-0.6 yuan. 香粳 (xiāng jīng, fragrant rice) and new粳 (jīng) rice fell by about 0.5 yuan.</p>
<p>New Gate: Yesterday, there were still many sources of supply on the alleyway. Sales on this street were sluggish. Thick粳 (jīng) rice and 薄稻 (báo dào, thin rice) prices both dropped by 0.3 yuan. Buying sentiment was extremely quiet. Market sentiment expected a gradual decline as the Autumn Festival approached. First, new goods were entering the market. Second, the Taikoo steamer brought approximately 200,000 bags of Min Dang Saigon small rice to port for storage. New粳 (jīng) rice and new customer premium goods arrived in large quantities, and prices were soft by 0.4-0.5 yuan. Old 蘆埠 (lú bù, reed wharf) premium goods were stagnant. Glutinous rice was affected by the broken粳 (jīng) rice and showed signs of weakness. The river factory opened approximately 2,000 shi of goods.</p>
<h3>Small Glutinous Rice Experiences Sharpest Price Decline</h3>
<p>▲ Spot Rice Down by 0.04 Yuan ▲ Futures Rice Down by 0.01 Yuan</p>
<p>The foreign rice market weakened again yesterday. Because foreign firms were vigorously peddling and the supply never ceased, merchants were discounting prices to sell, and the market saw a dramatic change. Small glutinous rice, due to over-ordering during the previous peak season, saw an even steeper decline than other rice, dropping by more than 0.04 yuan. Other rice also dropped slightly. Futures small glutinous rice returned cargo also fell sharply by more than 0.01 yuan. The market trend showed no signs of stopping. Saigon rice remained stable. Total market transactions for small glutinous rice were 3,000 bags, priced at 12.75 yuan to 12.55 yuan. Min Dang rice was 100 bags, priced at 13 yuan. Small glutinous rice for September was 300 tons, priced at 6.05 taels to 6.03 taels. October was 400 tons, also priced at 6.05 taels to 6.03 taels. Both were returned cargo. New transactions included Jardine Matheson selling 500 tons of No. 1 Saigon rice at 6.7 qian taels for November.</p>
<h3>Two Ships of Russian Wheat Ordered</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market saw unfavorable conditions in the morning after the opening, for all months. This was due to the confirmation of two ships of Russian wheat being ordered. Based on the current situation, continued transactions were expected, so sentiment was fearful and oppressed by this fact. This month's prices fell to a low of 3.7 qian taels, October and November fell to 3.74 qian taels, December to 3.79 qian taels, January to 3.83 qian taels, and March to 3.91 qian taels, a decrease of 0.02-0.04 qian compared to the previous day. However, when the market opened in the afternoon, it initially fluctuated, and then outside short sellers gradually covered their positions. The weak market trend rebounded, rising by 0.04-0.05 qian compared to the previous day's lowest price. However, due to excessive selling pressure, a decline was still expected. As a result, this month's price was 0.01 qian better than the previous day, October was unchanged, November was 0.02 qian better, and December to February were all 0.01 qian better.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market showed signs of weakness after the opening in the morning. Foreign wheat fluctuated slightly. There were rumors in the market about Russian wheat transactions. Two ships had been confirmed, totaling approximately 14,000 tons. One ship was ordered by a certain merchant, and the other by a factory. Delivery would be made in bulk in Shanghai warehouses, at a combined price of 3.8 qian taels. The transactions were reportedly a trial sale. Subsequent transactions would depend on China's needs. As a result, sentiment was unstable, and this month's price fell to a low of 2.0625 qian taels. Distant months also fell by 0.01 qian. When the market opened in the afternoon, nearby months saw some buying from customer firms, and distant months saw profitable short sellers covering their positions, slightly rebounding from the morning's lowest price. However, the overall trend suggested little hope of a reversal. As a result, the price for this month to December each decreased by 0.0025 qian taels, and January and February each decreased by 0.0075 qian taels.</p>
<p>Sugar Market: More Dumping and Transactions of Coarse Yarn White</p>
<h3>Spot Market Also Slightly Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw reports from the production area that the price of Cuban spot sugar was 1.40625, a decrease of 0.003125 from the previous report. New York sugar futures were priced at 1.33 for September, a decrease of 0.01, and 1.31 for December, with no change. The price for March next year was 1.35, also a decrease of 0.01, and 1.59 for May, a sharp decrease of 0.06. Java spot and futures sugar saw little fluctuation. Public association market reports saw minimal transactions of Dutch sugar No. 24 yarn white. New goods were priced at 12.6 qian taels, and No. 20 medium sand white was 11.1 qian taels, maintaining its firm price. Jardine Matheson's spot sugar also increased by 0.05 yuan. China New sold 600 bags of B mark at 11 taels. Market reports showed old B mark goods trading at 11.025 taels and HN mark at 11.525 to 11.55 taels, with a relatively firm market trend. Dumping of Dutch sugar was prevalent, and prices continued to fall. Tianxiang Foreign Firm sold 300 tons of coarse sand white ready for immediate loading. Shunquanlong Foreign Firm also sold 300 tons, both priced at 5.45 yuan. China New was also selling at the same price, and sold 3-400 tons. Later, the price was lowered by another 0.025 yuan to solicit business, weakening sentiment and resulting in few takers. Shang Shenglong sought to sell September No. 20 medium sand white at 5.25 yuan and No. 16 at 5.2 yuan. The other party was still interested, but required a telegram confirmation. Number reports had Jinfas selling 1,000 bags of spot new leased sand white at 11.6 taels and 1,000 bags of new No. 20 medium sand white at 11.1 taels. Although the price was unchanged from the previous market report, the market was quite stable.</p>
<h3>Zhabei Goods: Hunan Lotus Seed Market Prices High</h3>
<p>Sales Average:</p>
<p>Hunan lotus seeds have seen steady price increases recently due to rising land prices. Prices have also risen in Shanghai. Arriving goods and inventories are generally low, so there is little hope for price declines in the future. However, on the sales side, prices have slightly reduced. Yesterday's market prices were 65 taels for Xiangtan lotus seeds, 64 taels for Jiuxi lotus seeds, 63 taels for Hengzhou lotus seeds, and 60 taels for Changde lotus seeds. White lotus seeds have also risen to 52-53 taels due to the rising land prices in Lanxi.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Milanese Silk Prices Shift from Firm to Weak</h3>
<p>Milan Market: Since the arrival of new Italian silk, prices have increased due to European and American activity. Now that European sales are sluggish, prices have fallen. Super special grade is 391 lira, special grade is 345 lira, and upper grade is 288 lira. Each kilogram has fallen by 3-4 lira.</p>
<h3>Gaozhuang Zhenmei Tea Active in British Sales</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign market for tea saw Gaozhuang Zhenmei green tea from Wuyuan and Tunxi being actively traded by British firms such as Jardine Matheson, Concord, and Fok Shi. The market price for goods from the Wuyuan West Road area opened at 140-150 taels, unchanged from before. Gongxi teas continued to sell well in Russia. Baitou firms such as Ruichang, Fulin, and Qianyi continued to seek out tea. The market was becoming more active. However, major green teas saw a recent slump in American sales. The production volume for this year has been significantly reduced, and 80% of the tea has already been sold, so Chinese merchants are maintaining a firm stance.</p>
<h3>Metals: White Iron Sheet Metal and Colored Thin White Iron Selling Well</h3>
<p>Hardware transactions have been active and quiet at times, and trends for various colors have also been good and bad at times. Thin metal colors, such as No. 28 and No. 26 white iron sheet metal, have seen very prosperous transactions recently from customer firms. Factories and construction firms on this street are buying. As a result, the market supply cannot meet demand, and market goods are selling very well. No. 28 is estimated at 16.05 taels, and No. 26 is 15.05 taels. Thicker colors are selling poorly, so prices are lower. For example, No. 24 sells for 14 taels and No. 22 for 13.075 taels. Plain white iron is also experiencing slow sales for thick products and active sales for thin products, due to the smooth sales of thin colors. No. 28 is estimated at 17.25 taels, No. 26 at 15.75 taels, and No. 24 and No. 22 are estimated at 14.05 yuan.</p>

<h3>An Investigation of the Actual Situation of Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia (1)</h3>
<p>— Qiu Bincun</p>
<p>It is pitiful to say, our great China, because the majority of its people lack national consciousness and a sense of the country, and have no interest in politics, so that in form, although it has a so-called central government like other countries, and in foreign affairs, although it has so-called consuls like other countries, in reality, our government cannot obtain an equal international status for our country, and our consuls are even less able to assume the responsibility of "protecting overseas Chinese." Now, let's focus on the issue of consular protection of overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>Like the Japanese consulate, its internal setup has at least survey sections, foreign affairs sections, geography sections, compilation sections,... etc., to investigate the national power of the residing area and all the real situations of the overseas Chinese clearly, print publications in a well-organized way, and inform the people of the country to determine immigration policies and plan for the economic development of overseas Chinese to the best.</p>
<p>What about our country's consulates? The consulate is just an externally empty organ. Consuls only know how to collect visa fees, issue passports, and socialize with foreign adults with their wives. They do nothing else, nor do they know what to do. Regarding the important mission of surveying local national conditions and carefully examining the real situation of overseas Chinese, they have never even dreamed of it.</p>
<p>Since our commercial representative consulates cannot bear the responsibility of investigating the actual situation, let's do it ourselves. In the name of being a special correspondent for the Overseas Chinese Culture Department of Xiamen University, I took on the work of investigating the actual situation of overseas Chinese at my own expense before returning to China in previous years. As a result, my plan failed, and my enthusiasm for investigation also dropped to freezing point due to the failure... The scope of my investigation includes organized groups and institutions such as overseas Chinese chambers of commerce, reading newspapers, newspaper offices, guild halls, and clubs, etc., thinking that it would be easier to investigate the real situation of overseas Chinese by starting from organized overseas Chinese groups and institutions. The regions where I sent out various questionnaires include Siam, British, and Dutch possessions, totaling no less than several hundred. In fact, there are more than thousands of overseas Chinese groups and institutions in these three places, but I only received seven questionnaires filled out and returned, which is undeniably a strange thing.</p>
<p>Our nation has always been exposed to the world as a plate of loose sand, and our people have always been known to the world for their lack of unity. If the inferiority of our nation and people continues to spread, will our race and country still have hope? As for our overseas Chinese, under the oppression of the colonial suzerain governments and the siege of hatred from the colonial natives, there are various organized groups with national consciousness and patriotism, and cultural institutions to improve overseas Chinese culture are developing, which cannot be said to be a hopeful sign of our nation and a ray of light for the future of the nation. However, it is really not easy to see people who are responsible and manage well in overseas Chinese national groups. Otherwise, why would I have only received seven filled-out questionnaires out of hundreds of questionnaires I sent out? Now, I can only record these seven questionnaires I received and make a simple small report.</p>
<p>(1) Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>I don't know much about the chambers of commerce of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, and the investigation I sent out was not widespread, so the number of questionnaires received is equal to zero. Therefore, there is no way to talk about the real situation of the chamber of commerce. However, I can tell readers one thing I want to investigate about the chamber of commerce. Here is a blank questionnaire for investigating the real situation of the chamber of commerce, in the hope that Chinese consulates, chambers of commerce, or individuals can do a thorough investigation and statistics.</p>

<p>(2) Newspaper</p>
<p>Scholars who study newspapers in our country all know that the news industry in our country is divided into the following four periods: (1) The period of official newspaper monopoly (from the Han and Tang dynasties to the end of the Qing Dynasty); (2) The founding period (since the arrival of Protestant Christianity, Wollium Milon founded "Survey of the World's Customs" "Monthly Statistical Transmission," which was the beginning of modern newspapers in our country); (3) The period of prosperity (after the Sino-Japanese War, revolutionary thoughts flourished, leading to the success of the Xinhai Revolution); (4) The period of commercialization (since the establishment of the Republic of China until now, most of them tend to commercialization because they do not get involved in party struggles. Material progress is indeed considerable, but commercial colors are strong, and spirit is inevitably reduced.) The origin of overseas Chinese newspapers in Southeast Asia is also very long. When the Chinese-language newspapers in Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Japan, known as the three birthplaces of the Minbao, emerged, the Singapore Quanbao Zonghui Bao was also produced. However, the later Penang Guanghua Daily, Singapore Xin Guomin Daily, and Siam Hua Siam Xin Bao, etc. should be promoted for their hard work in the revolution.</p>
<p>Most of the newspapers of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia are for profit, but in recent years, in addition to making profits, they can often improve the editorial department, strive for news improvement, pay attention to illustrations, add pictorials, and tend to be artistic, which is a good thing.</p>

<p>(3) Reading Newspaper Society</p>
<p>The role of the reading newspaper society of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia is different from that of the reading newspaper society in China. The reading newspaper society in China has no other role than to collect books for people to read. However, the reading newspaper societies of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia were mostly founded by Sun Yat-sen leading the revolutionary pioneers of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia. Their role is (1) to carry out revolutionary work, but in the environment of living under others' roofs, they have to have the name of a reading newspaper society, such as the Penang Reading Newspaper Society, the Singapore Tongde Reading Newspaper Society, and the Xingzhou Reading Newspaper Society. (2) At the same time, to improve the culture and degree of overseas Chinese, such as various reading newspaper societies widely place books and newspapers for people to browse to increase knowledge, such as Guanghua Daily and Xin Guomin Daily have cultural institutions, and they are produced and survive by the Penang Reading Newspaper Society; (3) Promoting the popularization of overseas Chinese education, such as Singapore Overseas Chinese Middle School is the one founded by Tongde Reading Newspaper Society, Penang Zhongnong Middle School is the one initiated by the Penang Reading Newspaper Society, and Jiangsha Chonghua Yongzhong is the one initiated by the Juemin Reading Newspaper Society. Moreover, many high primary schools in various places are produced by reading newspaper societies; (4) In case of natural disasters and man-made disasters, reading newspaper societies in various places will collect rescue funds equally, such as the Tianjin flood, Shantou flood, Zhejiang flood, and Japan flood, etc. Man-made disasters such as the May 30th Massacre and the Jinan Massacre, etc. These reading newspaper societies have all collected huge amounts of money and achieved significant results. Therefore, the reading newspaper societies of overseas Chinese occupy a special and important position in the group of overseas Chinese.</p>
