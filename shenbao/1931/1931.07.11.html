<p>於此。吾人謹以至誠忠告日人。近世以來。太平洋上風雲。本巳日形緊急。隨時有因一髮之牽而引起世界第二次慘劇之可能。美總統胡佛氏爲欲弭此危機。使人類文明不至毁滅於一旦。正主張停付戰債賠欵一年。及進行召集軍縮會議。亟亟於謀世界永久之和平。此種精神。至爲可欽。日本立國太平洋上。爲全世界所注目。一舉一動。都與整個大局息息相關。際此全世界正籲求和平之日。日人獨不惜干犯衆怒。肆其侵略之野心。横行於太平洋上。向全世界挑釁。必欲引起人類第二次之大屠殺而後快。是何居心。德意志之覆轍。鑒在前車。日人目前之國力。是否可以比擬歐戰前之德意志。固巳不待吾人之較量而後知。就令能之。大戰一起。歲月延長。蕞爾三島。果將何以自存。日人目前藉反蘇俄之名。而謀達到侵佔我東北大陸之野心。欲以一手掩盡天下人之耳目。并避免列强之嫉妬。但事實顯然。衆目昭彰。天下耳目。豈日人一手所能掩盡。就令舉世瞶瞶。都爲日人所朦蔽。侵我東北。不至引起列强之干涉。但以中國之大。人口之衆。革命以後。民氣益張。此時之中國。巳遠殊於滿清時代及二十一條時代之中國。勢之所迫。玉碎亦所不惜。億萬大衆。一旦奮臂而起。以救國爲口號。以正義爲旗幟。拚其死命。與日周旋。日人果能確有把握置我東北於其掌握之中乎。此次萬寳山農民以赤手空拳之羣衆。一旦激於義憤。亦足以與日荷槍實彈之軍警相峙。雖排槍掃射。不稍退却。此種事實。實足予日人以當捧喝。日人滅亡韓國。巳歷年所。然而時至今日。不穩空氣。仍充滿鷄林三道。復國之聲。再接再厲。三韓志士。不惜斷脰以赴。事實具在。固難掩飾。統治韓國之不能。且欲跨步以入我東北大陸。高唱其鮮滿一元之謬論。能乎不能。日人殆未熟思。尤有進者。中日兩國。同文同種。近爲比隣。誼如手足。假如兩國果真能以誠意合作。互相提携。共謀兩國之福利。共保世界之和平。則何事不可竭誠商量。顧乃欲以暴力横肆侵凌。我國人尚未死盡。寗能俯首帖耳。任人宰制。彼田中者。實日人之大敵也。歷年來中日間無可平復之惡感。皆彼輩一手所造成。日人每一次暴力來侵。除激起我國對日經濟絶交之高潮外。日人所得。究有何物。故日人之真愛國者真善謀國者。必能主張以誠意與我國合作。彼田中諸人之謀國不臧。所貽誤日本國家。實至多且大也。日人慎勿狃於清日日俄兩次戰役之足以使其增加國富。增高國際地位。今日時勢。巳異往昔。日本國内情勢。如經濟之窘迫。國債之增高。失業者數目字之加大。國民思想之左傾。都岌岌可慮。外戰一興。内變必起。國本動摇。甚至不可收拾。殆可斷言。此點日本謀國智士。尤應認清。吾人爲愛惜日本計。爲維護和平計。深願日本爲太平洋上和平之神。而不爲擾亂和平之魔鬼。深願日本爲維護和平計。深願日本爲太平洋上和平之神。而不爲擾亂和平之魔鬼。深願日本爲推進人類文明之首功。而不爲毁滅文明之元惡。日人之真愛國真善謀國者。於此言其一熟慮長思。</p>
<p>至於三韓。過去關係。與我尤密。自彼國脈斷絶。吾人更深具同情。近年韓人之僑居我東北三省者。爲數達二百餘萬人。僑居我關内各地者。爲數亦至多。我國家我國民都一視同仁。向不歧視。此種事實。應爲三韓人士所公認。蓋以地位言。中韓同爲被壓迫之民族。以國勢言。尤有唇亡齒寒之實患。我國本國民革命之精神。謀被壓迫民族之互相提携。實爲神聖之職責。對三韓流離之國民。更何忍予以排斥。此次韓人在萬寳山强闢稻田。强挖水道。及全韓各地慘殺我僑胞之不幸事件。雖都由於日人發縱指使甚至以暴力威脅督促韓人而發生。但吾人對此。仍不能不引爲憾事。韓人國士尚在。宗祖之邱墓猶存。背鄉井棄邱墓而來我東北。舍巳之田而芸人之田。東出自願。抑由於暴力之壓迫。此韓人之所應深思者一也。萬寳山强闢稻田及水道。使我當地農民蒙受莫大之損失。以侵犯主權言。以侵犯利益言。究爲我國壓迫韓人。抑爲韓人受人敎唆壓迫我當地農民乎。此韓人之所應深思者二也。韓人受日人報紙之挑撥。與針小棒大之宣傳。發生排華之慘劇。以兩民族之血肉。爲日人而犧牲。我國僑胞。固巳財産損失。死傷貇藉矣。但韓人所得者。又果爲何物耶。中韓兩民族肉博於街巷間。日人則得意旁觀。慶幸其隂謀之得售。發縱由彼。鷹犬我任。兩敗俱傷。日人乃坐享其利。低首自念。痛乎不痛。我負三韓抑三韓負我。此韓人之所應深思者三也。尤有進者。韓人國亡家破。輾轉流離。處人暴力之下。生命且朝不保夕。身之所受。以及亡國之痛。應爲韓人一日所不能忘所不忍亡。而自身所應負之責任。應努力之工作。三韓志士仁人。更應認清。共起努力。而此次參加暴行之少數韓人。竟捨重就輕。其爲可痛。實十百倍於我僑胞之被襲擊。吾人正不暇爲韓人責。實不勝其爲韓人哀也。日來據日方消息。平壤等地排華呼聲。猶未止息。迷不覺悟。一至於此。吾人深願韓人速釋其襲擊之兇器。一靜心細思。更以掣誠祝望韓人努力担負其民族使命與時代使命。我國家基於弱小民族互相提携之原則。當永以摯誠與三韓志士仁人携手共進也。</p>
<p>最後。著者更謹以血涙致辭於我國人。歷來我國外交之失敗。都由於國人未能一致團結。强鄰環伺。得隙即逞。我能團結。則列强自無隙可乘。故國必自侮。然後人侮。近百年來之重重恥痛。應巳可以喚醒國人之沉沉酣夢。煑豆燃箕。自相煎逼。而置外侮於不足輕重。坐視國難曰亟。國恥日增。果必待國亡而後覺醒耶。上月二十六日外交部情報司長鮑靜安在廣播無線電台報告最近外交形勢。列舉近來因國内内政不能統一。而影響對外交涉之事實。國人應都有耳共聞。國難當前。何事不可捐棄。再不團結。共謀抗禦。更有待於何日。日人計劃巳定準備亦齊。空口交涉。决不能遏抑共侵略之野心。此次萬案之發生。不過其牛刀之小試。來日漫漫。嚴重情况。更可預揣。東北之危殆。亦即我國家之危殆。東北問題。非局部問題。而深繫我全國家全民族之命脈。此點國人深應認清。此次萬寳山農民有謂「我國家旣無力保護。被害者惟有起而自衛而巳。」語之沉痛。真如一字一血。一字一涙。令人不忍卒讀。國人聆此。寗尚再能無動於中。爲救東北計。爲救民族計。爲救我人自身計。再不團結。更待何時。再不奮起。更待何日。時危時迫。國人其興。傳有云。「無敵國外患者。國恒亡。」此次日人壓迫之來。自另一方面言之。實爲激起我民族力謀自强之絶好機會。六十年前。日本以美國數艘黑船之闖入。遂開民治維新之盛業。我國丁此大難。抑何不可以奮起維新。禍福無常。都在國人一廻念間。往者巳矣。來者可追。國人國人。猛醒猛醒。</p>

<p>螞蟻是昆蟲界中一個蕞爾小蟲。怎麽會醫傷呢。然而南美洲的秘魯Peru國。竟有這麽一回事。最近英國有一個游歷團前去游歷。據說曾親見當地的醫生利用螞蟻醫治外傷因爲秘魯有一種螞蟻。生着特有的强有力的牙牀。只要把它們放在可以咬嚙的所在。它們立刻會張牙咬去。並且牢牢的不放。所以土人們皮膚上要是受了甚麽傷。求醫生去醫治。醫生就將他的傷口擠緊攏來。而從地上拾一個螞蟻放上去。把它的頭貼在傷處。於是它立刻咬了。用它的挺大的牙牀。將傷口縫合。接着截去了它的身子。更把别的螞蟻一個個放上去。依樣的接在一起。直至全條傷口完全縫合爲止。這樣的療治法。真是聞所未聞哩。</p>
<p>鱷魚懸賞</p>
<p>德京柏林的動物院中。有一次從美洲運到了一千頭鱷魚。預備陳列展覽。院中主持者爲使大衆周知起見。用一個大汽球飛昇在動物院園地的上面。吸引觀衆的視線。汽球上寫着幾個大字道。「一千頭鱷魚。」可是那汽球的分量太重。而繫球的錨比較的輕些。不一會那汽球騰空而上。直到九千尺以上。漸漸不見了。於是園中主持者更利用這個機會。大事宣傳。說有誰找到這汽球。交還院中的。賞以活鱷魚一頭。决不食言。</p>

<p>古今同姓名者往往而然。自梁元帝有古今同姓名錄一書。續者紛起。近今人名。如徐世昌江朝宗張弧馬良王震之流。古皆有之。上海有探目張良。亦此類也。兹更就本報年來上海新聞所紀同姓名者數事。戲爲别解。以資談助。其登載月日。多巳遺忘。想讀者當猶在腦海也</p>
<p>蘇洵爲女徵婚告白　按蘇洵即宋蘇老泉。有女蘇小妹。負才自喜。苛於擇配。小說所記三難新郎。巳可概也。宜其徵婚必出之以告白矣。</p>
<p>孟浩然飲酒肇禍　按李白贈孟浩然詩。醉月頻中聖。迷花不事君。是浩然之好飲可知。但其人無灌夫駡坐之風。則亦何至肇禍。此其所以爲閘北之孟浩然歟。（報載其人住閘北）</p>
<p>趙子昻墮馬　按趙子昻即趙孟頫。以善畫馬名於時。至今得其寸縑。詡爲壞寳。胡竟以墮馬聞。意者良醫之子。必死於藥。良巫之子。必死於鬼。善畫馬者。必厄於馬耶。一笑。</p>
<p>宋玉被汚　按宋玉爲楚之美男子。其鄰有女。窺之三年。宋玉被汚。亦意中事。新刑律亦有女子强姦男子之條也。然今之宋玉。不雄而雌。倘與楚之宋玉諧爲伉儷。則真一對璧人矣。</p>

<p>— 王星垣</p>
<p>旬日以來。天氣炎熱。溽暑困人。雖巳入夏。而氣候如此燠悶。吾人早己預料不久將降大雨。洎至三日晚間。黑雲滿佈。雷聲大作。陣雨傾盆而下。連續不止。到處一片白水。幾成澤國。誠十餘年來所罕見。爰將見聞所及。誌之以告閱者</p>
<p>中山路上積水成潦。首都馬路。首推新築之中山路。平坦廣闊。幾與滬上之南京路相埒。自大雨之後。水勢未及排洩。竟積尺許。稍低之處。更無論矣。行人搴衣而過。水幾及膝。汽車往來疾駛。水花飛濺。真奇觀也。</p>
<p>人力車夫利巿三倍　水旣大漲。行人往來。大有行不得也哥哥之歎。因之人力車被呌一空。價昻二三倍不等。車夫喜形於色。然雨中狂奔。衣服淋漓。亦苦矣哉。</p>
<p>時髦女郎進退維谷　記者因事由下關赴新街口時。雨勢尚小。經鼓樓。有二女郎。絲襪革履。衣服麗都。彳亍途中。霎時大雨滂沱。不及躱避。遍體竟如落湯之雞。進退不得。可笑亦可憐也。</p>
<p>秦淮河水幾平兩岸　經此大雨之後。秦淮河水。亦巳暴漲數尺。幾與岸濟。倘無晴意。兩岸居屋。盡在水中矣。</p>
<p>江北客民呌苦連天　江北客民。叢集下關一帶。築棚而居。地都低處。雨後水漲。倒坍者爲數不少。未坍者悉浸水中。竟難安身。莫不愁容滿面。厥狀極爲可憐云。</p>
<p>江水暴漲浩浩蕩蕩　長江之水。入夏迄今。水勢奇漲。經此大雨。江水更漲丈餘。浩浩蕩蕩。高幾及岸。加之狂風吹激。怒浪澎湃。勢不可當。亦奇觀也。</p>
<h3 id="c261">談巴黎女子之修飾指甲 <a href="#c261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— 烟雨</p>
<p>巴黎繁華甲天下。固早巳蜚聲世界矣其於化妝一道。窮奢極麗。無與倫比。雖倫敦紐約。亦都望塵莫及。最近該邦女子。競以修飾指甲爲香閨韻事。鈎心鬥角。風行一時。兹特節譯數則。以饗讀者。</p>
<p>從指甲辨别女子　在今日法國社會中。吾人苟欲辨别一女子之時髦與否。祗消審視其纖纖十指之指甲。曾否經過一番精美之修飾。即可知之。因目下稍稍出入於交際塲所之法國婦女。巳無一再願保留其指甲之天然美。而不加以染色或繪圖矣。</p>
<p>指甲與衣裙一色　吾人苟徜徉於巴黎巿上。則立可見女子指甲上所染之顔色。每與衣裙之色相同。目下巴黎最流行之女子衣料。爲淺藍色。故若儕之指甲。亦大都梁淺藍色。以相配合。此種染指方法。非常簡單。宛如使用敷頰或點唇之胭脂膏。惟於染色之前。需先塗一種膠質水。以防褪淡之虞。然亦可隨時擦去。故一般時髦女子之指甲染色。每有隨衣裙而一日數變者。</p>
<p>千金一擲繪指甲　巴黎名舞女梅波麗。月入之豐。較法總統猶高十數倍。而生活之奢侈。堪埒后妃。衣飾化妝。恒爲全國時髦女子所景從。每逢梅波麗新裝一成。則不數日後。即巳風靡巿上矣。自修飾指甲之風興。女士迭翻新花樣。曾有不少貢獻。最近又特聘法國名畫家史德堡氏。於每一指甲上。各作巧小玲瓏之彩色花鳥。從此雪膚纖指。益以名家佳畫。相映之下。愈顯美媚。據云繪指所費。不下美金千元云。</p>

<h3 id="c263">游韓漫談（二） <a href="#c263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>— 寄萍</p>
<p>朝鮮排華暴動事件。據日代辦重光氏的代表林出謁王外長時所言。巳歸平穩。然而噩耗傳來。吾國總領事館竟於八日夜被暴徒搗毁。器具案卷。無一倖存。領館職員。暫避總督府。在館三千避難僑胞。死傷枕籍。慘不忍睹。朝鮮當局。旣不保護外僑。甚至友邦外交官駐在地。都不曾安全防範。所謂「近聽不聞雷霆之聲。熟視不見泰山之形」。其昏瞶失責。真是千古奇聞。在今有强權而無公理的世界。我們向誰去申訴。但我們維護公理。非把實情宣告於世界不可。</p>
<p>講到朝鮮總領事館。我又是脹了一肚子的氣。憶在漢城時。每天都到那裏去訪友。一進大門。便是一所華僑小學。領館内部。高樓大厦。比東京公使館還要加倍寛敞。庭園裏芳草妍花。林木葱蘢。景緻非常優美。回想當年袁世凱任商務督辦時。館後平房。都是他衛隊的營舍。他出門時前擁後衛。威風凛凛。城内有我國的警察。城外有我國的練兵場。治權操諸我手。韓人歌功頌德。後來甲午一戰。我軍慘敗。朝鮮併於日本。一切特權。完全撤消。到如今看那數幢平房。傾斜圯頺。滿目悽凉。領館絀於經費。任其破碎。巳令人起今昔之感。不幸突遭搗毁。想到那凌亂的狀態。不知讀者們作何感想。</p>
<p>朝鮮人對華的觀念。大概分析爲四派。五十歲以上的老年人。到還有厚道。他們追念光緒八年時李鴻章。吳長慶諸先賢統兵渡海。戡定朝鮮内亂。又想起吳兆有提督二次平定内亂的勞績。復時時不忘中國歷代扶助朝鮮的恩德。希望中國早日强盛之後。能再扶助他們弱小的民族。一般有志青年。不甘屈伏於日帝國主義暴力壓迫之下。來華參加革命。或研究學術。對日抱「不共戴天」的决心。尤盼吾國革命及早成功。還有那國内少數受過充分敎育的青年。他們雖感到亡國之痛。可是身不自由。啣怨飲恨。只好偷度歲月。然而那幾派究居少數。最多數的青年。從小受着奴隸敎育的麻醉。不知道自巳是何種民族。也不知道朝鮮過去的歷史。幾乎同化於日人。那班青年。根本不可救藥。此次暴動的羣衆。也就是這一輩子可憐的亡國奴。現在我們惟有希望存厚道的老年人。和革命的韓國青年。起來。起來喚醒那班不覺悟的蠢徒。</p>

<p>— 徐卓呆</p>
<p>子良不理伊，只管做自巳的事，夫人無法可施，便下樓去了，伊一到樓下，立刻就回上來，手裏拿着方才一封南京寄來的快信：</p>
<p>「這是什麽時候送來的？你爲什麽不告訴我？」</p>
<p>「在你看大出喪看得出神的時候來的。你回來之後，要緊羡慕白相人嫂嫂，我也來不及對你說。」</p>
<p>這時候，伊巳把信拆開，看了一遍，頓時興奮起來了：</p>
<p>「現在什麽時候了？」</p>
<p>伊過來拿丈夫左臂上的錶一看：</p>
<p>「兩點零五分，快來了，我要去換衣服了，你也換一件衣服才是。」</p>
<p>「什麽事？這是誰的信？」</p>
<p>「你不曉得麽？這是我的好朋友葉韵玉來的信，伊今天從南京到上海來，兩點半鐘可以到我家裏，我們去換衣服。」</p>
<p>「爲什麽伊來，我要換衣服？」</p>
<p>子良此時，想起了葉韵玉，心裏就担憂，因爲葉韵玉，又是一個會鬧的女子，伊身體極小，而聲音極高，因此，子良便替伊起一個雅號，呌做知了。伊是月如的同學，一向住在上海，去年伊丈夫供職外交部了，所以把家眷搬了去，子良家中，就不見知了的踪跡。伊是月如的好朋友，兩個人鬧在一起，今天還能夠做事麽？</p>
<p>「你真丢臉！韵玉的丈夫，做了官了，你鬧了幾年，還是一個學敎師，不怕羞麽？你再穿了一件舊布長衫出去見客人，我的面子，被你削盡了」。</p>
<p>「做官的，當然體面；白相人，也很闊氣。從你看來，只有學校敎師是寒酸的麽？」</p>
<p>月如不理他，趕到前面房裏去了，同時呌娘姨也上樓，帮着伊開箱子，尋衣服，洗臉，拍粉，鬧得亭子間裏，也大受影響。過了好一回，娘姨下樓去了，大約伊化妝好了，一陣高跟皮鞋的聲音，頓時亭子間裏，現出一個打扮得齊齊整整的夫人來。</p>

<p>Riots in Wonsan and Busan</p>
<p>Rumors of Destruction of Seoul Consulate Untrue</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Information from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs states: The Consul General in Seoul is safe, and serious negotiations are ongoing. Zhang Weicheng has not sought refuge. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The capital has not yet received an official telegram regarding the destruction of the Chinese Consulate General in Seoul. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the anti-Chinese incidents by Koreans, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a telegram today from the Kuomintang branch in Wonsan, Korea, stating that a Korean riot has erupted. In Wonsan alone, Chinese casualties are numerous, and the situation is even more dangerous elsewhere. 2,555 people have already sought refuge at the consulate, and more are on their way. The Chinese community is extremely indignant and urgently requests serious negotiations. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has just received a telegram from Chen Zubao, the Consul in Busan, stating that an anti-Chinese riot has occurred in Busan. As a result of negotiations, the Busan police have been fully mobilized to rescue the distressed Chinese residents. The consulate is currently sheltering over a hundred Chinese people. Overseas Chinese in other districts continue to send telegrams seeking assistance, and the situation is urgent. On the morning of the 8th, when the new Korean Governor-General passed through, Consul Chen personally requested measures to quell the riot. The Governor-General has promised to address the situation after taking office. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a public telegram received by the Ministry of Colonial Affairs at 9:10 PM last night, the situation in various parts of Korea on the 9th was generally stable due to the authorities' strict vigilance. There were only minor incidents of stone-throwing and small clashes between Koreans and security forces. The situation is gradually returning to calm, and the authorities are increasing vigilance. (10th Dentsu Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Various parts of Korea have gradually returned to normal since yesterday. Local sentiments are also gradually stabilizing and calming down. The Ministry of the Army announced the following this afternoon: The areas of Pyongyang and Chinnampo are now completely stable. Twenty-six auxiliary military police officers were withdrawn at 2:00 PM yesterday, and all troops were withdrawn at 6:00 PM yesterday. (10th Dentsu Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A telegram received this morning from Seoul states that the rumor of the destruction of the Chinese Consulate in Seoul is completely unfounded. This rumor likely arose because a wall of the consulate collapsed due to rain. (10th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Sends Wang Rongbao to Korea to Investigate the Truth</p>

<p>Japanese Newspapers Publicize the Expulsion of Korean Residents</p>
<p>Restrictions on Public Assemblies Specifically Relaxed</p>
<p>A Chinese resident who fled from Korea to Dalian yesterday spoke in detail about the anti-Chinese riots. After the Wanbaoshan Incident, Japanese newspapers extensively published false propaganda, fabricating various scenarios of Korean residents being oppressed by Northeast authorities, with the intention of provoking Sino-Korean animosity and profiting from it. On the 4th, Japanese newspapers in Incheon and other places suddenly published news of Korean farmers being massacred by Chinese farmers in Wanbaoshan, and that the Northeast authorities had ordered the expulsion of Korean residents. Koreans were greatly alarmed upon seeing this. On the evening of the 4th, Koreans held a citizens' assembly to discuss the issue of Korean residents being forced to leave. The Japanese authorities had always strictly prohibited Koreans from holding meetings, especially public assemblies, but they specifically allowed it this time. Ignorant Koreans were greatly incensed and formed groups to demonstrate in the Chinese district. Japanese police stood by and did not stop them. The demonstrators went to the vicinity of the Incheon Chinese Chamber of Commerce and threw stones, causing damage. Conflicts began between the shop front and the Chinese inside the Chamber of Commerce, and the Koreans then launched a large-scale attack on various Chinese businesses, with great force. The Japanese police patrolled the streets to the sides of the marching crowds. There was certainly a possibility of preventing the attack on Chinese businesses beforehand, but the Japanese allowed it to happen. Some Korean intellectual groups printed leaflets urging the public not to riot, but the Japanese police prevented their distribution. The Japanese police heavily guarded the Young Men's Association hall. The Japanese ulterior motives are obvious. (9th Shijiebao Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e6">Changchun City Prepares Report on the Wanbaoshan Incident <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Consul Tashiro's Attitude is Stubborn</p>
<p>(Harbin) After the Wanbaoshan Incident, Zhou Yubing, Director of the Changchun Municipal Preparatory Office, reported to Zhang Zuoxiang: "To Marshal Zhang of Jinzhou, may this message find you well. Regarding the respectful receipt of your top-secret telegram regarding the Wanbaoshan incident in Changchun County, where Korean farmers forcibly dug into private land to build waterways with the intention of constructing dams across the Yitong River to divert water for paddy fields: the farmers reported to the county government for prohibition, and the Japanese consul sent police to protect them. After negotiations between the two parties, it was agreed to withdraw the protection and suspend work, and to jointly conduct an on-site investigation and resolve the matter based on reason. The results of the investigation revealed that not only did the waterway pass through over twenty li, infringing on the ownership of the farmers, but also that the cultivated land of each household was cut into two sections, making farming even more inconvenient. Moreover, if the dam across the river were to be built, navigation would be interrupted, hindering transportation, and the river level would rise, causing flooding of the banks, with thousands of hectares of farmland being subject to water damage. These circumstances were formally communicated, but the other side did not acknowledge the facts. Therefore, on June 12th, Japanese Consul Tashiro Shigetoku, disregarding the consequences, brazenly sent plainclothes Japanese police with weapons to provide protection and continue the work. Repeated formal inquiries were made, clearly stating that if the police were not withdrawn and the work stopped, the other party would be fully responsible for all disputes and losses that might arise in the future. The consul completely ignored this and proceeded with the work. The farmers in the area, filled with anger and indignation, had no choice but to gather three hundred people on July 1st to implement legitimate self-defense measures and restore the original state. The consul requested that the Public Security Bureau be ordered to stop them, but this was reasonably rejected. The consul then sent a large number of armed Japanese police to the scene, and on the morning of the 2nd, when the farmers gathered, the Japanese police went to stop them. The farmers' representatives spoke to them reasonably, but they were beaten. The crowd rose up to protect them, and the Japanese police fired over a thousand rounds of live ammunition. The farmers all jumped into the trenches, so there were no casualties. The other side continued to increase the number of police, bringing machine guns. There were approximately fifty or sixty Japanese police on the ground, and they forcibly occupied the courtyards of farmers along the river, intending to hold them. Thereupon, on the 2nd, this office sent another letter to the Japanese consul, instructing him to withdraw all police on the same day and punish the police who caused the incident, while the county government consoled the farmers and waited for a negotiated resolution. There has been no response from the other side. Due to the aforementioned reasons, this report is submitted, and we request that it be forwarded to the Ministry for verification of the facts of this case, brought to the attention of the Japanese ambassador, and serious and fundamental negotiations be conducted to resolve it and avoid further complications. This is our sincere plea." (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) The ten Koreans involved in the Wanbaoshan incident are under joint guarantee. One person escaped, and the other nine were flogged. Although the Koreans currently find the work difficult, they are monitoring each other and dare not escape. Regarding this case, the Japanese side generally advocates for easing the situation and hopes to settle it with compensation for losses. However, Tashiro, the young and meddlesome Japanese consul in Changchun, remains stubbornly inflexible. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e7">Outrage is Extreme on All Sides <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the anti-Chinese riots in Korea and the Wanbaoshan incident, the First, Second, and Third District Branches of the Kuomintang in the capital dispatched over ten representatives to the City Party Headquarters on the afternoon of the 10th to petition, requesting that a request be submitted to the central government to conduct serious negotiations with the Japanese side and to order all party members nationwide to rise up in support and act as a diplomatic backing. Executive Committee member Xiao Jishan received them and promised to submit it for discussion at the next standing committee meeting. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Tenth Branch of the Tenth District of the City held a general meeting of party members on the 10th to discuss how to deal with the Korean riots in Korea and the case of the forced occupation of farmland in Wanbaoshan. It was decided to submit a request to the central government to forward it to the National Government, ordering the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to conduct serious negotiations. (10th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e10">Establishment of an International Club in Shanghai <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>In recent times, there have been interconnected relationships between progressive countries around the world. Commercial and economic issues, in particular, have had mutual impacts between nations. Therefore, whenever an issue arises, experts, scholars, and leaders from various organizations must first gather to conduct joint research and discussions. If the issue involves the development of commerce, the development will be rapid. If the issue involves resolving economic problems, the resolution will be easier. This explains the prevalence of international conferences. However, if there is no prior sentiment or contact and many people gather in one place, there may be conflicts and incompatibility. Therefore, it is necessary to focus on fostering sentiment in ordinary times. During holidays, opportunities for recreation are often used to exchange knowledge or establish friendships. In major trading ports and areas with thriving banks and commerce, countries must establish these kinds of recreational facilities where people from all directions gather. Although they are for private socializing, they substantially benefit diplomacy and the progress of commerce and the economy.</p>
<p>For years, we have only heard of the establishment of commercial associations or clubs of specific countries in Shanghai. Each goes its own way. We have not heard of the establishment of an international club. This is Shanghai's biggest shortcoming. In this 20th century, human civilization is progressing daily and has shrunk the vast Earth into a small ball. Every action between countries is closely related and has transcended national boundaries to become one. Therefore, it is even more necessary to establish an international social organization in Shanghai. The capital organized the International Friendship Society a few years ago, where Chinese and Western people could socialize in a political setting. It has achieved remarkable results since its opening. Now, the Shanghai International Club is about to be established. Its founders are well-known figures in the Chinese and Western economic circles. It will not only seek cooperation in Chinese and foreign economic endeavors, but will also take the lead in public diplomacy.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Recently, the Fujian Provincial Government telegraphed the Ministry of Interior, requesting an explanation of the meaning of the Opium Suppression and Investigation Bureau. Liu Shangqing took the telegram and asked the Executive Yuan for an explanation. The Executive Yuan stated that the Investigation Bureau had already been explicitly ordered to be abolished, and all opium suppression policies would be handled in accordance with all laws and regulations, continuing to prohibit planting, transportation, sale, and smoking without any leniency. The reasons for the abrupt cancellation of the Opium Suppression and Investigation Bureau this time are that it was not only giving the impression of loosening the prohibition, but also facilitating the encroachment of investigation agencies and opium merchants, with very little benefit to the public. In addition, the provinces involved were collecting shares and dividing responsibilities, causing widespread scandal and dragging things out, becoming a laughingstock at home and abroad. Even the original estimate of a monthly income of one million in Shanghai was actually less than half. Therefore, the decision was made to enforce the prohibition strictly. (10th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Willingness to Accept Stringent Arms Reduction Plan</p>

<p>After meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Stimson this morning, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini told reporters that if all other countries' armaments are no more than Italy's, then Italy can accept any possible minimum amount. Even if the entire territory of Italy is limited to 10,000 rifles, there is no problem. The two Prime Ministers also talked for two hours. After a long private conversation, Mussolini told people that Italy and Stimson held the same opinions on choosing a path to peace.</p>

<p>U.S. Secretary of State Stimson had his first meeting with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini at 6 p.m. this evening, lasting about an hour. The issues discussed included the U.S. loan to Italy. Furthermore, newspapers reported that the U.S. Secretary of State had stated to Mussolini that the U.S. greatly sympathized with Italy's position on naval armaments. Afterwards, Mussolini also received Italian and foreign reporters. During the conversation, Mussolini stated that Italy was willing to reduce its standing army to 10,000 men, but other countries must also make similar reductions. Mussolini also greatly praised President Hoover's new plan.</p>

<p>After a long conversation with U.S. Secretary of State Stimson, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini answered American reporters, stating that Italy was willing to accept a stringent arms reduction plan, as long as other countries did the same. In response to questions from the Associated Press about Italy's arms reduction methods, Mussolini stated frankly that Italy was prepared to accept the lowest possible limit on arms reduction, even if Italy were only allowed to have 10,000 guns, it would be willing to accept it. Italy will attend next year's arms reduction conference with the utmost enthusiasm and sincerity, because the Italian government firmly believes that in order to solve the economic crisis, the political and moral crises must first be solved. Therefore, Italy embraces a frank and peaceful policy.</p>

Furthermore, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has always been reclusive, and all diplomatic missions have been represented by Foreign Minister Grandi. Now there are rumors of his first visit abroad in seven years, but it is not yet known whether this hope can become a reality.</p>

<p>President of the German Reichsbank, Luther, Arrives in Paris</p>
<p>Has Long Conversation with President of the Bank of France</p>
<p>Rushing Around</p>
<p>Negotiating Loans</p>

<p>Dr. Luther, President of the German Reichsbank, arrived in London this afternoon by plane from Berlin. His purpose in coming to England is to propose a 50 million pound loan to Germany from the Bank of England. Germany is in urgent need of this loan. Another dispatch says that after arriving in London, Dr. Luther, together with Norman, President of the Bank of England, set off for Europe. Norman went to Basel, Switzerland, and Luther went to Paris first and then to Basel to attend the meeting of the Bank for International Settlements.</p>

<p>The fact that Dr. Luther, President of the German Reichsbank, is rushing around in Europe looking for money is attracting much attention in financial circles here. There is much discussion about the outcome of his mission, but most opinions predict that it will eventually succeed. Germany has to make a large payment this month, and the 100 million yuan that was provided to the Reichsbank last week will also expire on the 15th of this month. Although domestic banks and commercial firms have helped the Reichsbank raise 500 million marks two days ago, the government has issued an urgent order acknowledging the validity of this move, but this amount is still insufficient and only consolidates the Reichsbank's position to borrow larger amounts from British and American banks. Luther is rushing around for this large loan. It is reported that the New York Federal Reserve Bank will join in lending to Germany. If so, the German Reichsbank can overcome its current difficulties and escape the financial crisis.</p>

<p>The stock exchange opened rather weak today, with little trading, but because the Deutsche Bank had a steady outlook, and the hope for Luther's trip to London was good, people's hearts were firm. At the close, the various prices had an upward trend.</p>

<p>The President of the Deutsche Bank, Luther, and the President of the Bank of London, Naumann, arrived here together at 11 o'clock this afternoon. Luther is scheduled to meet with the President of the Bank of France tomorrow. After going to Beijing, Luther will probably go to Basel, Switzerland, with the President of the Bank of France on Saturday or Sunday.</p>

<p>Luther, President of the German Reichsbank, and Moret, President of the Bank of France, have been secretly negotiating from 10 o'clock this morning until noon, and it is not yet over. At today's luncheon, Luther will meet with French Finance Minister Flandin and former President of the Bank of France, Moreau. It is expected that there will be a comprehensive discussion among the three. Also, before going to the Bank of France, Luther met with reporters, claiming that the purpose of this trip was to seek convenience for loans, so that Germany could regain financial balance. He has tried his best in the past few months to persuade the presidents of international banks to resume the policy of long-term lending to Germany, because short-term loans are no longer sufficient to alleviate Germany's urgent needs, so long-term lending should be adopted even more.</p>

<p>After Dr. Luther, President of the German Reichsbank, flew to England today, he went to France with Mr. Naumann, President of the British National Bank. According to Luther, this trip is related to Germany's short-term loan problems, but the details are not yet fully known. At this moment, Germany's domestic finances are in extreme difficulty, so there is great hope for Luther's trip, and public opinion especially hopes that the major banks of various countries can extend the 400 million mark loan that is due on the 16th of this month and increase the amount of the loan.</p>

It is rumored that this trip is related to negotiating the rediscount of 400 million gold yuan for the Deutsche Bank. Naumann, President of the Bank of England, is going to Basel, Switzerland, and traveled with Luther to Dover.</p>

<p>Six members of the Seiyukai - Kodama Ujikazu, Kita Koji, Nakatani Sadayori, Terada Ichisei, Fujii Ihao, and Miyakawa Ikkkan - visited Colonial Affairs Minister Hayami yesterday afternoon to inquire about the truth of the Korean incident. After learning about the situation, they said that if the incident could have been foreseen, why didn't the Governor-General of Korea take appropriate measures? Furthermore, at the time of this major event, Governor-General Ugaki and other leaders were away from their posts for a long time, which could be said to be a major failure on the part of the authorities. Colonial Affairs Minister Hayami explained various matters and asked for understanding. The group left after deeming the Colonial Affairs Minister's response unsatisfactory. They are scheduled to visit Foreign Minister Shidehara this afternoon to ask the same questions.</p>

The selection of inspectors will be left to the secretaries. Both the Koseikai and the Research Society believe that the cause of this problem should be attributed to the weakness of Shidehara diplomacy. The two groups intend to cooperate to make the Korean issue a major government issue in the Upper House.</p>

The government had promised to use the money saved under the Hoover plan to reduce floating debt, so it was decided to temporarily repay this money and not extend the term of the debt.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<p>Here is a careful English translation of the provided sections of the historical Chinese newspaper *Shen Bao*, preserving whitespace:</p>
<p>Here, we would like to sincerely advise the Japanese. In recent times, the situation on the Pacific Ocean has become increasingly tense, with the possibility of a second world tragedy being triggered by even a slight incident. President Hoover of the United States, in an effort to avert this crisis and prevent the destruction of human civilization in an instant, is advocating for a one-year moratorium on war debt and reparations payments, as well as initiating a disarmament conference, earnestly seeking lasting world peace. This spirit is admirable. Japan, established on the Pacific, is watched by the entire world. Its every move is closely related to the overall situation. At a time when the whole world is calling for peace, the Japanese alone are willing to risk public anger, indulging in their aggressive ambitions, rampaging across the Pacific, and provoking the entire world, seemingly determined to initiate a second human massacre. What is their intent? The example of Germany's downfall serves as a warning. Is Japan's current national strength comparable to that of Germany before the European War? It goes without saying that we need not even make the comparison to know the answer. Even if it were, once a war breaks out and extends for years, how can these small three islands possibly survive? The Japanese are currently using the pretext of opposing Soviet Russia to achieve their ambition of invading and occupying our Northeastern territories, attempting to deceive the world and avoid the jealousy of the great powers. However, the facts are clear, and the truth is obvious to all. Can the Japanese truly deceive the world? Even if the world were deaf and blind and all deceived by the Japanese, and invading our Northeast did not provoke intervention from the great powers, China is vast, and its population is large. Since the revolution, the people's spirit has grown stronger. The China of today is vastly different from the China of the late Qing dynasty and the era of the Twenty-One Demands. When pushed to the brink, we will not hesitate to shatter like jade. Once hundreds of millions of people rise up in arms, with saving the nation as their slogan and justice as their banner, risking their lives to fight the Japanese, can the Japanese be truly confident of seizing our Northeast? In the recent Wanbaoshan incident, a crowd of farmers armed only with their bare hands, once stirred by righteous indignation, was able to stand up against the Japanese soldiers and police armed with guns and ammunition. Despite being subjected to gunfire, they did not retreat. This fact should serve as a wake-up call for the Japanese. The Japanese have been destroying Korea for years. However, to this day, an unstable atmosphere still permeates the three provinces of Korea. The calls for restoration grow louder and stronger. Korean patriots are willing to sacrifice their lives. The facts are there and difficult to conceal. They cannot even govern Korea well, yet they want to step into our Northeastern territories and sing the absurd tune of Korean-Manchurian integration. Can they succeed? The Japanese have probably not thought this through thoroughly. Furthermore, China and Japan share the same script and belong to the same race. As close neighbors, they should be as close as brothers. If the two countries could truly cooperate sincerely, support each other, and jointly seek the welfare of both countries and safeguard world peace, then what could not be discussed with sincerity? However, they insist on using violence to invade and oppress. The Chinese people have not all died yet. How can we possibly bow our heads and submit to being controlled? The likes of Tanaka are truly the great enemies of the Japanese. The irreconcilable animosity between China and Japan in recent years has all been created by them. Every time the Japanese resort to violence, it only triggers a surge in economic boycotts against Japan in our country. What have the Japanese gained? Therefore, the true patriots and wise strategists of Japan must advocate for sincere cooperation with our country. The poor national planning of the Tanakas has harmed Japan greatly. The Japanese should be cautious and not indulge in the belief that the two wars, the Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War, were sufficient to increase their national wealth and elevate their international standing. The current situation is different from the past. The domestic situation in Japan, such as the economic difficulties, the increase in national debt, the increase in the number of unemployed, and the left-leaning of national thought, are all cause for concern. Once a foreign war breaks out, domestic unrest will inevitably arise. The foundation of the country will be shaken, and it may even become impossible to recover. This is almost certain. This point should be recognized by Japanese strategists. For the sake of cherishing Japan and maintaining peace, we deeply hope that Japan will be the god of peace in the Pacific, not the demon that disrupts peace. We deeply hope that Japan will be the leading force in promoting human civilization, not the chief culprit in destroying civilization. The true patriots and wise strategists of Japan should consider this carefully and think it over thoroughly.</p>
<p>As for the Koreans, their past relationship with us was particularly close. Since their country was destroyed, we have felt even more sympathy for them. In recent years, the number of Koreans residing in our three Northeastern provinces has reached over two million. The number residing in various parts of our country within the passes is also very large. Our country and our people treat them all equally, without discrimination. This fact should be recognized by the Korean people. In terms of status, China and Korea are both oppressed nations. In terms of national situation, there is the real concern of "when the lips are gone, the teeth will be cold." The spirit of our National Revolution is to seek mutual support among oppressed nations, which is our sacred duty. How can we possibly exclude the displaced people of Korea? In the recent unfortunate events of Koreans forcibly reclaiming rice paddies and digging waterways in Wanbaoshan, and the massacre of our compatriots in various parts of Korea, although all of this was due to the Japanese instigation, direction, and even the use of violence to threaten and urge the Koreans to do so, we still cannot but regret this. The Korean patriots are still alive, and the ancestral graves still exist. Leaving their hometowns and ancestral graves to come to our Northeast, abandoning their own fields to cultivate other people's fields, is this of their own volition, or is it due to the oppression of violence? This is something the Koreans should think deeply about. The forcible reclamation of rice paddies and waterways in Wanbaoshan has caused great losses to our local farmers. In terms of infringing on sovereignty and infringing on interests, is it our country oppressing the Koreans, or is it the Koreans being instigated to oppress our local farmers? This is something the Koreans should think deeply about. The Koreans, incited by the Japanese newspapers and their exaggerated propaganda, have engaged in the tragic act of anti-Chinese violence, sacrificing the blood and flesh of two nations for the benefit of the Japanese. Our compatriots have already suffered property losses, deaths, and injuries. But what have the Koreans gained? As the two nations fought each other in the streets, the Japanese watched with satisfaction, rejoicing in the success of their conspiracy. They initiated the conflict, and we became their pawns, resulting in losses for both sides, while the Japanese sat back and enjoyed the benefits. Thinking about this, do you not feel the pain? Have we wronged Korea, or has Korea wronged us? This is something the Koreans should think deeply about. Furthermore, the Koreans have lost their country and their homes, and they are wandering and displaced. Under the violence of others, their lives are uncertain. The suffering they have endured and the pain of losing their country should be something the Koreans can never forget and never bear to forget. The responsibilities they should bear and the work they should do should be recognized by Korean patriots. They should rise up and work together. And the few Koreans who participated in the violence have chosen the easy path, which is a tragedy ten times greater than the attacks on our compatriots. We have no time to blame the Koreans. We are truly grieved for them. According to recent news from the Japanese side, the calls for anti-Chinese violence in Pyongyang and other places have not stopped. They are lost and unawakened. We deeply hope that the Koreans will quickly put down their weapons of attack and think carefully. We sincerely hope that the Koreans will strive to shoulder their national mission and their mission of the times. Based on the principle of mutual support among weak nations, our country will always work hand in hand with the Korean patriots.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to address our countrymen with tears of blood. The failures of our country's diplomacy in the past have all been due to the failure of our people to unite. Powerful neighbors are watching, ready to take advantage of any opportunity. If we can unite, then the great powers will have no opportunity to exploit. Therefore, a nation must insult itself before others insult it. The many humiliations and pains of the past hundred years should have awakened our people from their deep slumber. We are boiling beans and burning stalks, oppressing each other, and treating foreign insults as insignificant. We are sitting idly by as the national crisis worsens and national humiliation increases day by day. Must we wait until the country is destroyed before we awaken? On the 26th of last month, Bao Jing'an, the Director of the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, reported on the recent diplomatic situation on the radio, listing the facts of how domestic politics have affected foreign negotiations. Our people should have all heard this. In the face of national crisis, what cannot be abandoned? If we do not unite and jointly resist, what day are we waiting for? The Japanese have finalized their plans and made their preparations. Empty negotiations will never be able to curb their aggressive ambitions. The occurrence of the Wanbaoshan incident is just a small test. The future is long, and more serious situations can be anticipated. The danger in the Northeast is the danger to our country. The Northeast issue is not a local issue, but is deeply connected to the lifeblood of our entire nation and our entire people. This point should be recognized by our people. In the Wanbaoshan incident, the farmers said, "Since our country is unable to protect us, the victims have no choice but to rise up and defend themselves." These words are so painful, like a word of blood, a word of tears, making it unbearable to read. Hearing this, can our people remain unmoved? To save the Northeast, to save the nation, to save ourselves, if we do not unite, when will we? If we do not rise up, what day are we waiting for? The times are dangerous and pressing. Our people, rise up! It is said that "a nation without foreign enemies will perish." The oppression of the Japanese, on the other hand, is a great opportunity to stir up our nation's determination to strengthen itself. Sixty years ago, Japan, with the intrusion of a few American black ships, began the great work of the Meiji Restoration. Our country is facing this great calamity. Why can we not rise up and reform? Fortune and misfortune are impermanent, all depending on the change of heart of our people. The past is gone, but the future can be pursued. Our people, our people, awaken, awaken!</p>

<h3 id="e87">Confrontation Between Chinese and Japanese Military Police in Wanbaoshan <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Military Police Concentrate 700 Personnel</p>
<p>Japanese Police on the South Manchurian Railway Line Await Mobilization Orders</p>
<p>Japanese Consul's Reply Contains Strong Words and Unreasonable Arguments</p>
<p>Changchun dispatch: After the Wanbaoshan incident occurred, on the 2nd and 3rd, Japanese military police successively went to support, totaling 500 personnel. Together with the military police who arrived in Wanbaoshan earlier, there were more than 700 personnel in total. They are now stationed in the rice paddy area and inside and outside the town. Zhou Yuping, the Director of the Municipal Government and concurrently the Director of the Foreign Affairs Office, and Ma Zhongyuan, the County Magistrate, believing that Japan was destroying Sino-Japanese relations, specially dispatched Tang Yuheng, the Chief of the Security Corps, and Lu Qi, the Chief of the Public Security Bureau, to lead 350-360 police and security personnel to protect the victimized Chinese people and stop the illegal actions of the Japanese military police. Lu departed with his team around 10:00 AM on the 2nd, and Tang led his team to support at 8:00 AM on the 3rd. However, around 9:00 AM on the morning of the 4th, the Japanese side again sent 40-50 soldiers. Our side also sent Hu Qingfeng, the captain of the mounted patrol team, to lead 30 mounted patrolmen, and Fu Kui, the captain of the security team, to lead 50 cavalrymen, all under the command of the County Magistrate, to go directly to Wanbaoshan to reinforce. According to a telephone report at 4:38 PM on the 4th, our military police had all arrived. The Japanese army's plan to go to the villages to collect firearms from the farmers filling the ditches was dispelled because our police and security personnel were concentrated for monitoring and refused based on reason. However, the Chinese and Japanese military police are stationed in the rice paddy area and Wanbaoshan town, forming a confrontational situation. Director Lu and Chief Tang demanded that the Nakamura team of the Japanese army return to Changchun together with their team to await instructions from their superiors. They replied that they would not withdraw until the case was concluded and they received orders, and that if the Chinese people gathered again to fill the ditches, they would be dealt with by force.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 3rd, Japanese residents in Changchun held a Wanbaoshan Korean Farmers Support Association meeting at the Yoshino-cho Performing Arts Hall, organized by the Japanese Youth Association of Toutaogou and the Changchun branch of the Kenjidan. In addition to the leaders of various institutions, there were also all members of the Changchun branch of the Japanese Autonomous Alliance in Manchuria, students from commercial schools, and thirty or more Japanese women, totaling 140 Japanese and Koreans. Many resolutions were passed at the meeting, and the content was quite secret. On the same day, the Police Bureau of the Kwantung Government also telegraphed the Japanese police stations along the Princess Ling, Kaiyuan, Sipingjie, and Tieling lines, ordering them to each select ten elite personnel within the shortest period of time to reinforce Changchun and participate in the operation in Wanbaoshan. Upon receiving the telegram, the above police stations immediately complied. In addition, the Japanese garrison stationed in Toutaogou also received a telegram from the Japanese consul ordering them to prepare for deployment and go to Wanbaoshan in the shortest period of time to provide support for the Japanese police.</p>
<p>When the Wanbaoshan incident occurred, Toshiro, the Japanese consul in Changchun, immediately received two letters from Zhou Yuping, the Director of the Municipal Government on our side, proposing negotiations. Toshiro initially ignored the letters and finally replied with one letter, filled with strong words and unreasonable arguments, which is excerpted below to show the Japanese people's cunning: "To the esteemed Zhou, Director of the Changchun Municipal Government Preparatory Office: Regarding the Sanxingpu Farm issue, yesterday, July 1st, a staff member was dispatched based on a report from that area to convey the events of the violent actions of your country's farmers. Although we previously notified your side, there was no intention to suppress the rioters, and we had no choice but to dispatch appropriate police to protect the Korean farmers. However, according to subsequent reports, a hundred farmers from your country suddenly destroyed the embankment construction and filled the ditches. The police previously dispatched by our side stopped the Korean farmers' resistance in order to avoid conflicts between the two sides. It was found that when the rioters went to the scene at 10:00 AM on July 1st, Tian Xizhan, the Chief of the Second Public Security Sub-bureau of your country, was present with seven policemen to stop the farmers' riot, but they were beaten by them. Based on this kind of violent behavior, our police cannot but take self-defense measures when it is unavoidable. We hope that your side will take complete measures to vigorously stop the farmers' violent behavior. In addition, according to the Korean farmers' request, the damages suffered by the farmers due to the destruction of the embankments and filling of the ditches will be investigated later. We kindly request negotiations, etc. Addressed to Zhou, Director of the Changchun Municipal Government Preparatory Office, July 2nd, Showa 6th year, [signed] Toshiro, Consul stationed in Changchun." At the same time, the Japanese consul also requested the Municipal Government to allow the establishment of a temporary telephone line between Wanbaoshan and Changchun to facilitate communication. After hearing the situation, Director Zhou of the Municipal Government replied with the most humorous words, saying, "Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs plans to extend the Beining Railway directly to Tokyo, Japan. I wonder if the Japanese diplomatic authorities can approve it." The Japanese consul was ashamed and speechless. This is truly due to the lack of Japanese diplomatic talent and their unfamiliarity with international law, and it also shows their contempt for our country's sovereignty. (July 4th)</p>

<p>The Group Currently Lingering Near Yumen</p>
<p>Tianjin News: Guang Lu, the representative of the Xinjiang Provincial Government stationed in Beijing, recently came to Tianjin on official business. Yesterday, he received a telegram from Jin Shuren, the new Chairman of Xinjiang, stating that the Yellow Race Inspection Group would be strictly refused entry. The previous rumor that the group had already entered Xinjiang was fabricated. The original telegram is as follows: "Guang Ji Gaojian, the Yan telegram is received. Ma Zhongying's bandit remnants, totaling two to three hundred people, have lost all their arms and supplies. We have mobilized to strictly prevent them. Even if they want to flee west, they are not to be feared. Xinjiang's welcoming or refusing the Academic Investigation Group of 19 depends entirely on the government's orders and public opinion. There is no single welcome to the French side. Bu An's counter-espionage is a fabrication. The original telegram will not be difficult to expose. Chu was deceived, which is truly negligent. We have already telegraphed to investigate and stop it. No legal person is allowed to enter. Please disclose this telegram to avoid misunderstandings. Chairman Jin Shuren Dong Wu Print."</p>
<p>Beiping News: The Ancient Relics Preservation Committee yesterday received a telegram from Jin Shuren, Chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial Government, reporting that the Sino-French Inspection Group is still lingering near Yumen, repeatedly requesting entry into Xinjiang, but has been refused. The original telegram is as follows: "To Qian Mengcai, Brother of the Beiping Ancient Relics Preservation Committee: The Sino-French Inspection Group is still lingering near Yumen, repeatedly telegraphed, requesting entry. We have strictly refused it. As for the French side's publicity that Xinjiang welcomes legal persons, that is not the case. It is clearly a provocation. Ma Zhongying's troops have been severely attacked, and now there are only three to four hundred people left, unable to do anything. Special announcement, Jin Shuren Dong, (July 8th)"</p>

<p>Majority of Red Bandits Still Defending Old Nest</p>
<p>Nanchang dispatch: News was received from the front lines that other than the fact that one contingent of red bandits are attempting to escape to Min territory, the majority are still defending the old nests. Zhu Mao's main force has gathered in Guangchang Ningdu Xingguo Shicheng Ruijin Huichang regions, and its important units, such as the fake Soviet and fake military commission, are situated in Ningdu Guangchang county town, as well as the bandit dens like Luokou Xiaobu Longgang Donggu Chenggang Shaxi Futian Baisha etc. The bandit front lines are located at the border of Lean and Ningdu in Zhaoxie, border of Nanfeng and Guangchang in Qia Village, as well as Hengshi in Yihuang, Yaotian in Yongfeng, Shuikou and Baisha in Jishui, Futian in Jian, Guobei in Taihe. In addition, the borders of Wan'an Ganzhou and Xingguo Yudu are also bandit front lines centered around Ningdu. The Red Bandits have no base in Eastern Jiang, and are largely guerillas. After the annihilation of the red armies in Nanfeng, the red bandits were at a loss, and fled to Southern Jiang and Western Min, hence the extremely quick progress made by the left wing, with the annihilation of the bandit army of Lichuan already breaking out of the Min border, and the various armies in Nanfeng pressing on Guangchang, and Kangdu could be retaken. After retaking this area, the various red bandit gangs of Jianning in Fujian, and Ningdu Guangchang Nanfeng in Jiangxi, could no longer link up. The central route is trying to take Ningdu, the right wing attacking Futian Shuikou and Yaotian, having already reached the bandit region and pressing closer to the bandits' positions.</p>

<h3 id="e91">Jinan Again Searches for Qian Wencan's Remains <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Another Page of the Tragic History of the May 3rd Massacre</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The May 3rd Massacre saw countless Chinese citizens killed. Moreover, the Japanese army always moved and destroyed corpses after committing atrocities. Therefore, to this day, the exact number of martyrs remains unknown. Cai Gongshi, a diplomat, was martyred at the old Diplomatic Affairs Office. Recently, Mrs. Cai came to Shandong to search for his remains. Excavation resulted in only a pile of charred bones and several lumps of burnt flesh. Now, the family of Qian Wencan is also requesting exhumation. The process is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>A week before the May 3rd Massacre, an event ignited the tragedy. On April 26th, two Japanese soldiers were swaggering eastward on Jing Si Road, west of Jinan Commercial Port Park. Suddenly, a person in plainclothes fired a pistol at them from behind in an assassination attempt. The assassin then fled into the park. It was rumored at the time that the attacker was actually a Chinese rogue hired by the Japanese to provide a pretext. Consequently, the Japanese implemented a full-scale emergency curfew in the city starting on April 26th, inspecting pedestrians with extreme violence. At this time, Qian Wencan, a linesman from the Jinan Telegraph Bureau, finished his work in the western part of the commercial port and was returning to the bureau by car. Unexpectedly, he was stopped by the Japanese army for inspection. Because Qian did not understand Japanese, he was arrested and taken to Donglu Middle School, south of Sanlizhuang, as the school was occupied by the Japanese army at the time and used as a garrison headquarters. From then on, Qian disappeared. The Telegraph Bureau tried every means to rescue him, but the Japanese army flatly denied knowing anything. It was not until the Japanese army withdrew in the 18th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1929] that the Telegraph Bureau and Qian's family went to Donglu Middle School to search. However, when the school was occupied, all the staff had been driven away, and the files had been burned, making it impossible to investigate. The mysterious case remained unresolved. To commemorate this case, the Telegraph Bureau erected a monument at Jinpu Station with the inscription "Although the barbarians' bombs are fierce, the spirit of the martyrs is immortal," to commemorate the martyr Qian. In September of the 18th year [1929], when Donglu Middle School reopened, it was full of rubble and severely damaged. Workers were hired to repair the damage. At that time, Qian's family and friends went to the school to search, but found nothing. This year, Mrs. Cai Gongshi came to Jinan to excavate the remains of the martyrs, and obtained many bones. Qian Wencan's wife, Qian Yu Peiyuan (from Jiangsu), was touched by this and also wanted to come to Shandong to search. She entrusted Yu Bangnai, the business manager of the Jinan Telegraph Bureau, and Lu Yaoxi of the Yanji Telegraph Main Line Works Office of the Ministry of Communications, to contact Donglu School. Principal Zhu Jinggu of the school, considering this a matter of national humiliation, readily agreed. Mr. Lu and Mr. Yu then requested the Jinan Telegraph Bureau Works Office to issue an official letter. Donglu has replied, requesting that the excavation be carried out during the summer vacation to avoid interfering with school affairs. (July 9th)</p>
<h3 id="e92">Dangerous Situations Occur in the Upper and Lower Reaches of the Yellow River in Shandong <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: In recent days, the water level in the upper reaches of the Yellow River has risen sharply. Fortunately, the spring embankments are still intact, preventing a breach. However, the south bank of Liuzhuang was hit by a strong current, which was extremely turbulent. The Kaibao [brushwood and earth dams] were washed away, and the dam collapsed, creating a very dangerous situation. Zhang Lianjia, the director of the River Affairs Bureau, is inspecting the upper reaches. The Cao Prefecture Eight County River Works Promotion Association sent an urgent telegram to the province yesterday (the 7th), requesting funds and materials for emergency repairs. The relevant letters and telegrams are recorded below: (1) The River Works Committee's letter stated: "To the Director of the Shandong River Affairs Bureau and Standing Committee Member of the River Works Committee, Zhang: We have received an urgent telegram from the Cao Prefecture Eight County River Works Promotion Association stating that the south bank of the Yellow River in Liuzhuang is being hit by a strong current, the water level has risen by four feet, two sections of Kaibao have been washed away, and the dam has collapsed. They urgently request funds for emergency repairs, etc. In addition to promptly convening a meeting to discuss solutions, we are sending a copy of the telegram for your review. Respectfully yours, Shandong River Affairs Bureau." (2) The River Works Promotion Association's telegram stated: "To Chairman Han of the Provincial Government, Director Li of the Department of Civil Affairs, Director Zhang of the Department of Construction, Director Wang of the Department of Finance, Director He of the Department of Education, Director Wang of the Department of Agriculture and Mining, and All Members of the Provincial River Works Committee: The south bank of the Yellow River in Liuzhuang is being hit by a strong current, the water level has risen by four feet, two sections of Kaibao have been washed away, and the dam has collapsed. There are no materials or funds, and the situation is critical. We urgently request that funds be allocated for emergency repairs to protect the lives of the people. We are extremely anxious. The Cao Prefecture Eight County River Works Promotion Association kowtows."</p>
<p>Dangerous situations have also occurred in the lower reaches. Urgent telegrams have been received from the downstream sections, stating: (1) "To Director Zhang of the River Affairs Bureau: According to the report from the Third Flood Season Defense, due to heavy rain in recent days, there are a total of twenty-six wave nests caused by the erosion of the newly added Hou Chuang and the dam foundation at Wu Yangjia. Each wave nest requires about five or six fen of soil. As the project lacks foundation protection, erosion and wave nests are unavoidable. In addition to ordering the section to quickly fill and reinforce to prevent accidents, we respectfully report this. Li Fuchang, Section Chief of the Fifth Section of the Lower North, kowtows." (2) "To Director Zhang of the River Affairs Bureau: We have inspected the Guiren East New Shoal in this section. Since spring, it has eroded, collapsing a width of five zhang and a length of over one hundred zhang. The remaining root filling is only two zhang. The current has become slightly smoother. A total of five hundred and thirty-six old willow saplings that had survived on the shoal have been washed away. We respectfully report this for your review. Li Fuchang, Section Chief of the Fifth Section of the Lower North, kowtows." (3) "To Director Zhang of the River Affairs Bureau: We have inspected the sixteenth tier of rock protection downstream of the Buddha Head Temple dike. It has now been completely washed away, damaging the dike body. We plan to build four new sections of attached brushwood dike to resist the current and prevent major risks. We respectfully report this. Zhou Yumei, Section Chief of the Fourth Section of the Lower South, kowtows." (July 8th)</p>
<h3 id="e93">Continued Reports on the Tragic Flood Situation in Northern Guangdong <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>The Counties of Yingde and Qingyuan Have Become Vast Expanse of Water</p>
<p>Many Drownings and Collapsed Houses; Flood Victims Deprived of Food</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Previous reports have briefly described the floods in the northwest rivers of Guangdong Province. Further investigation reveals that the disaster in the North River is particularly severe. According to a telegram from the Yingde section chief of the Yuehan Railway, the area around the Yingde branch line has been flooded. Moreover, at piling position number 3497, Lan Mountain has collapsed, preventing train passage. The subgrade on the upper section of the Pajiang has collapsed for over 400 feet. At piling position number 610 in Pajiang, the subgrade has collapsed for over 1,000 feet. At Bancun, the subgrade has collapsed for over 2,000 feet. The electricity poles in that area have been washed away by the water. The villages of Pajiang have become a watery world. The water level in Caotang Market is rising further. Bridges and markets near Yuantan have been flooded. The water level is still rising at a rate of three inches per hour. According to refugees, this flood in the northwest rivers is the worst in ten years, as tragic as the disaster in the year of Yimao [1915]. Along the North River, from Yingde downstream to Bolokeng, Lidong, Hengshi, and Pajiang, the area has become a vast expanse of water, reaching depths of seventeen or eighteen feet in some places and eight or nine feet in shallower areas. Village houses have been flooded up to the roofs, and countless houses have collapsed. Refugees are camping on the mountains, their cries shaking the wilderness, and deaths are occurring one after another. In Yuantan, over a hundred refugees have no place to live and have gathered in a nearby broken brick kiln. The kiln walls suddenly collapsed, burying over a hundred refugees alive, with no survivors. On the 30th, over twenty houses collapsed in Yuantan, drowning dozens of men and women, whose bodies floated away with the current. In Qingyuan County, the floodwaters suddenly rose by over twelve feet starting on the 29th. The upper and lower Guo Streets in Qingyuan City have become a watery world. The area in front of the county government is over a foot deep. The affiliated Zhoushin, Jiangkou, Feishikou, and Shantang areas have water levels matching the eaves of the houses. Livestock and paddy fields have been completely submerged. Rafts of fir wood (used for timber) moored on the river have been washed away, causing tens of thousands of dollars in losses to various timber shops. In Shantang Township, over twenty houses were knocked down by fir wood rafts. Rice and grain within the city have run out. A special envoy came to the province one day to request disaster relief. The boat journey from Qingyuan to Shantang takes thirty minutes. No paddy fields can be seen along the way; only a vast expanse of water. Only the trees and grass on the hills can occasionally be seen. The landslides on the mountainside that collapsed at Bolokeng on the Yuehan Railway several days ago have now piled mud on the road, covering an area of approximately sixteen to seventeen hundred feet. Moreover, over ten thousand old railroad ties along the railway have been washed away by the water. The roadbed has been eroded by the water, forming cavities. Repair work will take at least twenty days. Through trains on the Yue Shao Railway are suspended indefinitely. In total, the losses from the North River flood to the Yue Shao Railway Bureau alone are estimated at several hundred thousand dollars. Various charitable organizations here believe that the disaster in the North River is serious and have been organizing and dispatching relief teams in recent days. The Nanyang Company relief team purchased 50,000 loaves of bread, 50 bags of rice, and a large quantity of biscuits, bait, and medicine. A team of sixty members departed along the Yuehan Railway on the morning of the 3rd. Also departing on the same day was the Fuguo Mining Company relief team, heading to Yuantan to distribute relief. It is impossible to travel beyond Yuantan because the North River is turbulent, and boats cannot sail upstream. The situation beyond Yuantan is unknown. Since yesterday, charitable institutions such as Guangzhou Convenience Hospital have formed corpse retrieval teams and have ordered a large quantity of coffins, which they are carrying to the disaster areas to recover the bodies of drowned refugees. The water level in the West River is simultaneously higher than in the North River. Disaster conditions are currently being investigated, and a detailed account will be provided in the next dispatch.

<h3 id="e94">Shanxi Currency Continues to Plunge Wildly <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>First Discounted Lottery Redemption</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: Since the provincial government announced the 25% discounted consolidation method for Shanxi currency, the exchange rate between paper money and silver dollars on the market has never fallen below three yuan, and the daily market has been relatively stable. Yesterday was the first day of the new method implementation where discounted lottery redemption was conducted, but the currency price not only failed to rise due to the lottery, but also fell by 32 jiao or more per yuan in a day or two. As a result, social discussions were rampant, presenting a kind of incredible phenomenon. The newly established lottery method still sorts all the paper money issued by the provincial bank by the last two digits of their serial numbers into one hundred lots. Excluding the previously drawn lots 86, 19, and 95 which were redeemed at full value, it is now planned to divide the remaining ninety-seven lots into seven drawings, with the first drawing being thirteen lots, and subsequent drawings being fourteen lots each, to be held every five months, and is estimated to be completed in three years. All drawn lots can be redeemed from the provincial bank at 40% of their face value. Yesterday was the first day of the lottery. Around 10 o'clock, many people had gathered at the entrance of the Chamber of Commerce, blocking the road. Representatives from various institutions and the public numbered about a thousand. Around 12 o'clock, Gao Buqing, the general manager of the provincial bank, announced the opening of the meeting. Xing Fenggang, the representative of the provincial government, was elected chairman, and briefly explained the lottery procedures. Thirteen people were randomly selected from the audience to draw one lot each. The numbers drawn were 98, 96, 82, 75, 66, 62, 57, 49, 39, 30, 25, 34, 79, etc. However, the drawn lots only differed from the current price by 40 jiao per yuan, and in practice, they only differed from the undrawn notes by a few fen of silver dollars per yuan, so it was not particularly noticed by the general public. The most concerning issue for society is still whether the currency price can be stabilized. Yesterday, the reporter visited a gentleman from the financial sector and asked about the reason for the continuous decline in the price of provincial currency in recent days. According to the conversation, although the financial consolidation method decided by the provincial government is not perfect, in Shanxi, which is currently facing financial difficulties, it can be considered a relatively good method. If all parties can prioritize the overall welfare and remove the previous bad ideas of only knowing private interests and disregarding the overall situation, then the financial situation of the entire province can gradually stabilize. However, all parties are not doing this, and are instead intensifying their pursuit of individualistic gains. Although there are many reasons for the decline of the provincial currency in the past, manipulation by a small number of powerful figures in the financial sector is the main reason. For example, on a certain day, the provincial bank sold 200,000 silver dollars, but ordinary businesses did not dare to intervene, and only certain businesses connected to the banking authorities purchased as much as possible, causing the currency price to fall sharply. If the provincial authorities only know how to verbally prohibit this, the result will only be that ordinary people suffer, while large businesses with sufficient financial resources and access to information will take advantage of the situation and earn even greater profits, etc. (July 6th)</p>

<h3 id="e98">Continued Report on the Wuhu French Concession Lawsuit <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Higher Court Sends Personnel to Investigate</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: The Wuhu Lawyers Association has accused Pei Xiyu and Da Shiying, judges of the local court, and Li Weixin and She Honghao, two lawyers, of malfeasance, embezzlement, and bribery. The association resolutely reported them, ordering the expulsion of the two lawyers She and Li from the association, and submitting accusations to the Control Yuan, the Ministry of Judicial Administration, and the Anhui Higher Court. Thus, a major disturbance has arisen between the legal profession and the judiciary. Zeng Youhao, the president of the Anhui Higher Court, traveled from the province to Beijing and made a special stop in Wuhu to investigate the matter, and also dispatched Sheng Shibi, a prosecutor from the Higher Court's Procuratorate, to Wuhu to conduct a preliminary investigation into the truth of the case. After She and Li were expelled from the Lawyers Association, She alone accused Zhang Benyi and Huang Jing, the drafters of the accusation submitted to various parties by the Lawyers Association, of smoking opium. She also accused Ge Fenglai, the president of the Lawyers Association, and members Hu Baisha and Huang Jing of abuse of power and obstruction of rights. Li Weixin, for his part, also accused President Ge Fenglai of obstructing the exercise of his rights. It is truly a complex and tumultuous lawsuit. The court considered the accusation of obstructing rights to be an act of judicial administration and dismissed the case. The court immediately accepted the accusation of opium smoking. After Huang Jing arrived at the court, he underwent 74 hours of examination, and no signs of opium addiction were found. He continued to draft documents, hold discussions, and perform his duties as usual. As a result, various witnesses, the court, the bailiffs, and Lawyer She Honghao all agreed that there was no need for further examination. Yesterday, Cui Xiangqiu, the former president of the Lawyers Association, Ge Fenglai, the current president, and Chen Ya arrived at the court together to welcome Huang out. At this time, Zhang Benyi, another lawyer accused of smoking opium, suddenly returned from Shanghai and went to the court to surrender. He stated that the prosecutor handling the case, Pei Xiyu, was one of the defendants accused by the Lawyers Association and should be recused. The court accepted this and reassigned Prosecutor Li Yucang to conduct the interrogation today. Zhang stated that he does not smoke opium, and that She, resentful of the fact that he was one of the drafters of the accusations by the Lawyers Association, was intentionally retaliating. He also argued that the court's issuance of an arrest warrant without first issuing a summons was unlawful and requested that a doctor be appointed to examine him in order to protect his reputation. It is reported that the Higher Court believes that this case has a significant impact on the judiciary and is determined to investigate it thoroughly. Due to the complexity of the case, it is planned to hold the trial in Wuhu for the sake of convenience. (6th)</p>

<p>Chen Xiaopeng, the president of the Anhui Central Bank branch, was sentenced to two years in prison by the Jiangning District Court for embezzling public funds and ordered to return the embezzled funds of 26,000 yuan. Chen refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the Higher Court. After a final hearing, the court pronounced its verdict on the 10th, still sentencing him to two years in prison and imposing a fine of 1,000 yuan. Regarding the 26,000 yuan portion of the embezzlement, the court considered that 24,000 yuan was not handled by Chen Xiaopeng and rescinded that portion. However, 2,000 yuan was confirmed to be fraudulent by Chen and should be returned. Chen still refused to accept the verdict and declared in court that he would appeal to the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>Zhang, an adopted daughter-in-law with the nickname Qiaogu, from the twenty-third district of the county, was abducted and sold three years ago by Huang Apu, a local rogue, to a brothel in Hankou. Later, fortunately, Zhu Hanzhong, a carpenter from the same village, rescued her from the fire pit and remarried her as a concubine to You Pusheng, a cigarette broker. Unexpectedly, You recently failed in business and came to Shanghai to make a living. Forced by food and clothing, he mortgaged his wife to Hu Huogen, a Tianjin native, for 200 yuan. Hu then hired someone to sell her to another port, but Zhang, having experienced great hardship, regretted her past mistakes. Therefore, she took a boat back yesterday and went directly to her husband's house, kneeling down and begging for forgiveness. Finally, the relatives of both parties reconciled, and they were reunited. One party, after the incident, reported Zhang's kidnapping by Huang Apu to the county court today, requesting that he be punished according to the law.</p>

However, some dishonest merchants are taking the opportunity to raise prices, which is inappropriate and should be strictly prohibited. The county should send personnel to work with the County Chamber of Commerce to thoroughly investigate the prices of various commodities before the abolition of transit taxes and the prices of various commodities after the abolition of transit taxes, as well as the actual increase or decrease, and submit a detailed list for review. After receiving the order, the department yesterday specially forwarded it to Magistrate Pan of this county to comply with it.</p>

<p>Wuyi has been experiencing continuous heavy rain recently, and the low-lying fields have become a swamp. The river water has risen sharply, causing great panic among residents along the banks. Before the rain, the price of rice was about nine yuan per load. It rose to nine yuan, eight or nine cents the previous two days. Starting from the 10th, it has been sold for ten yuan and six cents. If the weather does not clear up and goods do not arrive from the river, prices are expected to rise further. Near Qishuyan in the eastern countryside, Wang Xiaolong's boat collided with Chen's black bean boat the other night due to the rapid water flow. Chen and his wife and children fell into the river. Xiao Long stopped his boat to rescue them. Chen and his wife and two sons were rescued, but his three-year-old daughter was dead when she was pulled out of the water. The beans and rice in the boat sank or floated away. Furthermore, a Changzhou-Wuxi express boat carrying fifteen pieces of tin foil also capsized near Yangqiao浜. Although it was recovered, the tin foil was damaged by water and was useless, resulting in a loss of about one thousand six hundred yuan.</p>

<p>Dear Sir, We are writing to address the case of He Bingsen, the owner of Heyuanji Woodwork, who was found to have used old city bricks in the wall of the Hongxing Pool construction on Zhongshan Road. This office thoroughly investigated and found evidence that He Bingsen, the owner of Heyuanji Woodwork, claimed that the bricks were obtained at a price after dismantling the wall of the Security Office Prison, and that when moving the broken bricks when paving the floor of the Finance Department, these bricks were sorted out and there were only a few. Because the He Bingsen, the owner of Heyuanji Woodwork, was suspected of using public property, he was immediately punished by constructing a public project worth one hundred yuan, and He Bingsen submitted a written guarantee on file. Your newspaper published an article on the 6th of this month that this office would punish He Bingsen, the owner of Heyuanji Woodwork, for stealing city bricks and would be fined 4,000 yuan for confiscation. This is not in accordance with the facts. This letter is specially sent to request a correction.

<h3 id="e125">Jiangsu Province's 20th Annual Education Budget (6) Shi Zhang <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>(6) Review of the Implementation of Last Year's Budget</p>
<p>The actual and possible budgets for this year have been discussed in detail by the reporter yesterday. Of course, a mere ideal estimation of last year's income and expenditure does not fully conform to the actual situation. Now, let’s make a precise calculation based on the monthly income and expenditure reports published by the Education Fund Management Office. In this way, the reality of last year's budget can be obtained here. However, up to the most recent time, the income and expenditure reports of the management office have only been printed and published until March of this year, and the reports for the three months of April, May, and June have not yet come out, so there is no way to guess their numbers. But there is also a remedy, which is to add up the actual income and expenditure figures for the nine months from June of last year to March of this year, and calculate the average number. This average number is equivalent to the monthly value of the other three months (April, May, June). Although it is not completely accurate, it may be roughly similar. The actual income, expenditure, and balance of the nine months are listed below:</p>
<h3 id="e126">Actual Income and Expenditure Status of Each Month from July 18th to March 19th <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Month Item Income Actual Number Expenditure Actual Number End of Month Balance Remarks</p>
<p>July 19 One Six Seven, Nine Four Eight, Eight Five One One Five, Seven Zero Zero, Seven Zero One Four Two, Seven Seven Six, Five Two Last month's balance was Nine Zero</p>
<p>, Five Two Eight, Three Nine</p>
<p>August One Five Seven, Four Five Six, Five Seven Two Four Two, Zero Zero Six, Eight Nine Five Eight, Two Two Six, Two Zero</p>
<p>September Two One Five, Six Seven Zero, Eight Eight One Nine Nine, Two Six, Five Three Seven Four, Seven Eight Zero, Five Five</p>
<p>October Four Six Five, One Three Nine, Four Seven Three Nine Eight, Five One Four, One Two One Four One, Four Zero Five, Nine Zero</p>
<p>November Four Eight Zero, Nine Nine Six, Four Three Four Two Three, Two Four Six, Seven Zero One Nine Nine, One Five Five, Six Three</p>
<p>December Two Eight Seven, Six Six Two, Eight Zero Three Eight Zero, Eight Eight Seven, Eight Five One Zero Five, Nine Three Zero, Five Eight</p>
<p>January 20 Two Four One, Six Five Nine, One Six Two Six Zero, Six Four Eight, One Nine Eight Six, Nine Four One, Five Five</p>
<p>February Six Three One, Four Seven Three, Two Five Five Zero Nine, Five Eight Two, Seven Zero Two Zero Eight, Eight Three Two, One Two</p>
<p>March Five One Zero, Seven Four One, Seven Five Five Seven Nine, Eight Five Seven, Eight One One Three Nine, Seven One Six, Zero Six</p>
<p>Total for Nine Months Three, One Five Eight, Seven Four Nine, One Six Three, One Zero Nine, Five Six One, Four Nine Four Nine, One Eight Seven, Six Seven The remaining balance of the above item, plus the balance for June, is exactly One Three Nine, Seven One Six, Zero Six, which is the same as the balance for March.</p>
<p>Let us look at the table on the right. The total income for the nine months is more than 3,158,749 yuan, with an average of more than 50,972 yuan per month. Assuming that the total income for the three months of April, May, and June is 1,052,916 yuan, then the total income for the whole year will be 4,211,665 yuan. (The reporter assumed yesterday that the annual income would be less than 4,300,000 yuan, and the difference seems to be small.) As for the expenditure, of course, the situation is the same. As long as we understand the actual income and expenditure situation in the past, we can imagine the general trend in the future. The reporter sincerely prays for the success of the Jiangsu Province's 20th Annual Education Budget, and will discuss its progress in detail with readers on this day next year. (End)</p>

His victory was entirely due to his extremely resolute determination. In the second singles match, Bailey's victory over Haxied was without much contention. Bailey's straight-set victory showed that the British players had fully returned to their original state. Although they were in a foreign land, their spirit was even better than in the Wimbledon tournament, and the championship situation was looming.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Interest Focused on the Anglo-American Decisive Battle <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>With Britain's elimination of the Czech Republic already a settled fact, all interest is now focused on next week's Anglo-American zonal final to win the right to challenge France. The United States has won the Challege Round for four consecutive years, while Britain has not won it since 1919. The Davis Cup was last won in 1912. In total, the United States has won the cup 10 times, Britain 5 times, Australia 6 times, and France 4 times.</p>
<h3 id="e147">The United States Still Holds a Zonal Advantage <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Judging from the performance of the American team members in the Wimbledon tournament, the United States still holds the advantage in the Anglo-American zonal final. Van Lenlood's doubles are probably insurmountable for Britain, and Hills Wood's singles are also likely to win.</p>

<p>Preparations Completed, Lectures to Begin on the 20th</p>
<p>Listeners Recommended by the Education Bureau, No Individual Admissions</p>
<p>Jiangsu Province has always strongly advocated for sports. Recently, in view of the importance of social sports, it established a summer vacation training class for service personnel of public sports fields in various counties this year, which is organized by the Zhenjiang and Nanjing Provincial Sports Fields to enhance the effectiveness of promoting social sports in various counties. Since the preparations began, it has been two weeks, and in addition to the meeting place already borrowed from the Zhenjiang Public Education Center, all the lecturers have been hired, the curriculum schedule has been compiled, and lectures will begin on July 20th. It is also reported that because the listeners of this class have special goals and actual difficulties, it is stipulated that the education bureaus of various counties should recommend current and former service personnel of the sports fields. Physical education teachers of primary and secondary schools in various counties may also request their local county education bureaus to recommend them together. Individual direct applications will not be accepted. However, many people who do not know the procedures have sent letters to the association to register. According to the staff of the Zhenjiang Public Sports Field, the eagerness of various places to learn about sports is indeed a very good phenomenon. Unfortunately, the methods for this year's training class have been decided and cannot be accommodated. It is hoped that there will be a summer sports training class with complete facilities next year to meet this need.</p>

<p>The Korean anti-Chinese incident is becoming increasingly serious. Overseas Chinese have been attacked by Korean rioters, with countless deaths and injuries. Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting lodged a strong protest with Japanese Acting Minister Chongguang Kui on the 9th.

<p>Incheon Chinese Chamber of Commerce Asks for Funds for Relief</p>
<p>Taxpayers' Association Telegram Asks to Send Troops to Protect Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>Since the Wanbaoshan incident in Jilin, where Korean farmers forcibly planted rice paddies, the anti-Chinese trend in Korea has intensified, and the lives of overseas Chinese are in imminent danger. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce received a telegram from the Incheon Chinese Chamber of Commerce yesterday, requesting funds for assistance. All sectors were indignant. The city's industrial and commercial groups will hold a meeting to expand publicity. The Taxpayers' Association sent a special telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday, requesting the speedy dispatch of troops to protect overseas Chinese. The situation yesterday is recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Telegram from Seoul <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce Greetings: In recent days, major riots have occurred throughout Korea, with countless deaths and injuries. Seoul, Incheon, and other places have sheltered more than 8,000 overseas Chinese refugees, and funds are extremely difficult. Please allocate funds for relief. We are extremely eager to receive them.

<p>The city's industrial and commercial groups, in view of the fact that the Wanbaoshan incident is actually a conspiracy by the Japanese to implement their Manchurian-Mongolian policy, and cannot be compared to a simple local incident, believe that if the Chinese people continue to be lenient, the Japanese will become even more barbaric and continue their aggression. Therefore, they have risen up and convened all public groups in the city to hold an enlarged publicity meeting at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce on July 13th at 2:00 p.m., and to discuss anti-Japanese plans. It is reported that the convening notice was issued yesterday.</p>

<p>Wang Xiaolai and Xu Jiying, Chairmen of the Shanghai Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association, telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing yesterday regarding the Wanbaoshan incident: Minister Wang Greetings, ever since our government decided to abolish foreign consular jurisdiction in China and withdraw its troops stationed in China, the relevant foreign governments have said that our country's laws and order do not have the ability to ensure the safety of the lives and property of their people traveling in China, and that there is a possibility of danger. The Japanese government is especially vociferous. However, this time, in the Wanbaoshan incident, the Koreans ruled by Japan relied on their consular jurisdiction and troops to illegally oppress our people. Korea is now a region ruled by Japan, and the anti-Chinese movement of its people is extremely cruel, with 2,000 to 3,000 overseas Chinese killed or injured. This shows that the Japanese government has completely lost its ability to maintain law and order. Therefore, we especially telegraph Your Excellency, in addition to seriously negotiating the Japanese people's anti-Chinese atrocities, regarding Japan's consular jurisdiction and troops stationed in China, take effective measures, otherwise we can only request the government to send troops to Korea to protect overseas Chinese. We eagerly await your reply.</p>

<p>National Government Ministry of Foreign Affairs Greetings: According to a public telegram from Korea, the riots have temporarily stopped, but the people are uneasy. Chinese businessmen have closed their doors, and they especially hope that government officials will come to handle the aftermath. The Shanghai Association is urged to quickly urge the authorities to relieve the people's suffering. According to this, the Korean people's riots have stopped and restarted repeatedly, and their intention has not died. If methods are not quickly taken to stop them, I am afraid that the riots will resume. The lives of tens of thousands of people are in imminent danger. We earnestly request Your Ministry to quickly send special personnel to stop the crisis and handle the aftermath. We eagerly await your reply. Shanghai Shandong Guild Hall.</p>

<p>National Government Ministry of Foreign Affairs Greetings: The Korean people's anti-Chinese riots have brutally killed overseas Chinese and destroyed shops. The shocking news has spread, and the public is in a panic. We have repeatedly received telegrams from overseas Chinese in Korea, stating that lives and property in Pyongyang, Incheon, Seoul, Wonsan, and other areas have suffered great losses. Other places have also been severely damaged. Japan is a country of law and civilization in the world. How can it not be able to stop these rioters?

<p>The Shanghai Journalists' Union declares regarding the Korean people's brutal killing of overseas Chinese: All elders, brothers, and sisters in the country, please be aware. Since the Jinan Incident, the anti-Japanese movement of our people has become increasingly lax, and the Japanese imperialists' aggression and oppression of our country have become increasingly intensified. Judging from the Japanese immigration policy implemented in Manchuria and Mongolia in recent years, their ambition is clearly visible. This time, the Japanese instigated Koreans to forcibly plant Chinese farmland in Wanbaoshan, causing public outrage among our people. The Japanese imperialists dared to disregard justice and instead used machine guns to shoot our innocent Chinese farmers, causing countless deaths and injuries. In recent days, riots have spread throughout Pyongyang, Incheon, Seoul, and other places, and our overseas Chinese have been brutally killed without end. The news has spread, and it is extremely hateful. This kind of organized and planned barbaric act is not only prohibited by law, but also intolerable to justice. If this can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated? We earnestly hope that the people of the whole country will rise up and fight a decisive battle with the Japanese imperialists until the purpose of punishing the murderers and compensating for the losses is achieved. We hereby declare.</p>

<p>Bonus...5% of 30% of Net Profit</p>
<p>Housing...Annual Subsidy of 10,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The Chinese electrical workers of the city have been passively striking due to the company's lack of sincerity in resolving the housing and bonus issues, with trains running without ticket sales. The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs scheduled a mediation for yesterday, but the labor and management sides had already reached an agreement and signed a resolution on their own the night before. The situation is recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Negotiation Situation <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>At 9:00 a.m. on the 9th, the First District Water and Electricity Industry Union sent responsible representatives Zhou Guangrong, Tang Junsheng, Zhu Hanhe, Fang Ronggeng, Jia Renjie, and others to negotiate with Lu Bohong, manager of the Huashang Electric Company, and representatives Yao Xinzhi and Zhu Shaoyi, among others, on the workers' bonuses and housing issues. Because the union obeyed the workers' will, it requested the company to allocate 200,000 yuan to purchase land to build workers' housing, to be completed by the end of 20 years. Before the construction is completed, the company will issue a housing allowance of 10 yuan per month to each person. The board of directors will be responsible for proposing the bonus from the 20th year onwards, and the shareholders' meeting will approve that the workers' share of the annual net profit should not be less than 21.96%, of which 60% will be used exclusively for the labor cause fund, and the remaining 40% will be distributed to the workers according to the size of their wages. The company insisted on not acknowledging this. Until 7:00 p.m., the labor side repeatedly made concessions in order to maintain their inherent feelings, and the issue was finally resolved.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Resolution <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>The original text of the worker bonus and housing issues resolved by mutual agreement and signing between the labor and management sides of the Huashang Electric Company is as follows: (1) The company shall not provide less than 5% of 30% of the net profit each year as a bonus for the workers, to be handed over to the union for distribution. (2) The company shall provide 10,000 yuan in national currency each year as a special subsidy, to be handed over to the union each month for equal distribution to all workers. (All supplementary negotiation clauses will be added when the contract is signed, and will be implemented from June 1st of this year.)

<p>Constantly Believing… It Occurred Within Our Own Territory</p>
<p>The Proper Solution… Request the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission for Rescue</p>
<p>Following the forced landing of a Eurasian Aviation Corporation plane in Outer Mongolia, Mr. Shuang Qing, the general manager of the company, made the following statement yesterday: (1) The reason and location of the plane's landing, according to telegrams, the landing point is 248 kilometers south of Manzhouli, southeast of Lake Baikal, which is within our national border. There do not appear to be any national troops stationed there. The reason for the forced landing has not yet been reported in detail, but it is speculated that it was due to the adverse weather conditions, forcing a landing, resulting in detention by Mongolian soldiers. The transportation is inconvenient, and the pilot has been unable to report the news to the company. (2) The current rescue methods, the company immediately reported to the Ministry of Communications upon receiving the telegram. Now, it has submitted a request to the Ministry of Communications, requesting the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission to find ways to rescue them, so that they can be released as soon as possible. Perhaps the local authorities in Outer Mongolia are not clear about the true situation of the postal aviation run by our company. This action may have arisen from a misunderstanding. It is expected that once the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission sends a telegram to explain, there will be no problems. As for the news that the German staff of our company in Peiping have asked the German consulates in China to intercede with the Soviet Union for rescue, this may be a rumor or a misunderstanding. Perhaps the German consulate, considering that the detained pilots and workers are all German nationals, is seeking to rescue these two Germans, and, out of friendly relations, is asking the Soviet consulate nearby to help. It is possible, but our company constantly believes that this matter occurred in the Outer Mongolian region of Chinese territory, and has absolutely no connection to diplomatic relations. The only proper solution is to ask the Ministry of Communications to request the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission to explain and rescue them. As for the No. 1 and No. 3 planes sent to search, they flew back to Peiping from Manzhouli on the 9th via the original route, and no obstacles occurred. It can be seen that the No. 2 plane's accident was also accidental, or there is no other background. We cannot regard a temporary event as a major issue, and engage in overly sensitive speculation, which would only create further complications. As for the Berlin special dispatch, stating that the German Foreign Office has begun negotiations with the Soviet Foreign Office, it is probably also about the rescue of German pilots and seeking Soviet friendship, and it is definitely not about specific negotiations regarding this matter, etc.</p>

<h3 id="e190">Results of Petition in Beijing by Representatives of the Sichuan Association <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Both the Presidential Office and the Executive Yuan Agreed to Forward to Chairman Chiang</p>
<p>Sichuanese in Beijing and Shanghai Prepare for Large-Scale Petition</p>
<p>The Sichuan Provincial Association in Shanghai, in opposition to Liu Xiang and Liu Wenhui requesting the central government to approve the issuance of two 20 million yuan post-disaster reconstruction public bonds, sent executive committee members Qiu He, Huang Fogong, and Huang Douyin to Beijing to petition. They have now completed their work and returned to Shanghai. According to Tan, the results obtained are as follows: (1) The National Government sent Secretary Zhu Wenzhong to meet them, stating that the government is aware of the suffering of the Sichuanese people. The request to reject the two Liu public bonds will be reported to the Chief Secretary, who will forward a telegram to Chairman Chiang for instructions. (2) Liu Gongqian, Section Chief of the First Section of the Secretariat of the Executive Yuan, met them, stating that the government has already shelved the provincial public bond requested by Liu Wenhui. The post-disaster reconstruction public bond requested by Liu Xiang had already been approved by the State Council. Currently, due to the opposition of the Sichuanese people, the government is still carefully considering whether to approve its issuance. The request to reject it will be presented to President Song, who will forward a telegram to Chairman Chiang for a decision. (3) The Legislative Yuan sent Secretary Chen Haicheng to meet them, stating that the Legislative Yuan has no prejudice regarding this matter and has not yet submitted it to the general assembly for discussion. The request to reject it will be forwarded to Acting President Shao and the legislative members. After the petition, Representative Qiu and others, because the Presidential Office and the Executive Yuan have already agreed to forward a telegram to Chairman Chiang, immediately invited Sichuanese in Beijing to discuss and unanimously telegraph Chairman Chiang, requesting that he heed public opinion to save the people of Sichuan. They also decided that if approval is not granted, they will gather Sichuanese in Beijing and Shanghai to organize a large-scale petition group to appeal to the central government until their goal is achieved.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Rice Merchants Petition for Exemption from Business Tax <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday Representatives Were Sent to Petition Various Agencies</p>
<p>The Rice Merchants Association, because the Municipal Finance Bureau announced the business tax rate schedule, including the grain and rice industry in the one-thousandth tax levy, already explained that rice and grain are related to the people's livelihood and that the levy of business tax on the rice industry would only increase the burden on the people. They have already listed reasons for requesting the Municipal Finance Bureau to exempt them from the tax, but have not received approval. Upon seeing a report that the Zhejiang Provincial Government had decided to exempt the grain and rice business tax, they specially cited the case to request the Party and government agencies to exempt the Shanghai rice merchant business tax. Yesterday, they nominated representatives Lu Wenshao, Zhang Nianxuan, Shi Hongxun, Lu Jingwen, Xu Jingzhi and five other gentlemen who went to the Municipal Government at 10:00 AM, where they were received by Section Chief Luo of the Second Section. The representatives explained the purpose of their visit, stating the importance of rice and grain to people's livelihood. Section Chief Luo agreed to report this to the mayor. After the representatives excused themselves, they then went to the Municipal Finance Bureau, where they were received by Secretary Chen. After leaving, they returned to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, where they were received by Commissioner Fang, who agreed to forward the reasons to the Yuan (Executive Yuan) and the Municipal Government to request exemption based on the case. The representatives then took their leave, by which time the clock had already struck twelve. The petition document is transcribed below: It is submitted that rice and grain concern the people's livelihood, requesting that the Zhejiang precedent be followed and that business tax be exempted. I note that the Shanghai business tax rate schedule has already been issued by the Municipal Finance Bureau, stating that the rice and grain industry is subject to a one-thousandth tax on business volume, and so on. Because rice and grain are closely related to the people's livelihood, we have listed reasons and requested the Municipal Finance Bureau to grant an exemption, but no reply has been received. Recently, we saw a report that Zhejiang Province has already approved an exemption for the rice and grain industry. We wish to restate our reasons and request that the precedent be temporarily exempted. We note that Shanghai is not a rice-producing region, and the daily needs of the people depend entirely on the supply from neighboring producing areas and foreign companies. The rice and grain sold in rice stores and door markets, in rice stores and factories in the producing areas, have already been taxed. Foreign rice has already paid customs duties. If the business tax of rice shops is levied again, it would be multiple taxes on one item, which obviously violates the principle of one tax per item, this being the first point. Shanghai city has a population of 2.7 million, most of whom are poor people. Just by checking the rice sales, inferior rice and foreign varieties make up the majority, which is enough to prove the number of poor people in Shanghai. The addition of business tax to rice and grain will inevitably lead to cheap sales prices, indirectly exploiting the livelihoods of the common people, this being the second point. In the past, when lijin tax had not been abolished, other industries suffered from it, but the rice and grain industry was fortunate enough to be spared. Now that the lijin tax has been abolished, a tax has been added instead, without benefiting from the abolition of lijin tax and suffering from its harm instead, this being the third point. In recent years, disasters and crop failures have been reported repeatedly, and the price of rice has been high, increasing costs and making profits difficult. Whenever the transition between seasons is approaching, the price of rice will be high and expensive, and the community will rise up to criticize it. Government offices restrict prices, and rice shops suffer from the burden of buying high and selling low. Selling rice at retail often leads to the loss of capital. Looking back on past events, there have been many places where panic occurred due to the high price of rice. Workers demand rice allowances which leads to disputes, and labor unrest occurs frequently, creating an unstable social scene, this being the fourth point. The borders of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces are adjacent to each other, and Shanghai is especially close. Since Zhejiang Province has been granted an exemption, and the situation in Shanghai is the same as in Zhejiang Province, it should be requested according to the precedent. I respectfully request that the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry, and the Central Party Headquarters consider the importance of food for the people and approve the Shanghai Municipal Government to follow suit and exempt the rice and grain industry from business tax in order to reduce the burden on the common people. In addition to nominating representatives to petition the Municipal Government for an exemption, the timing is pressing. We earnestly request a prompt reply for guidance. With utmost urgency, we await your command. I respectfully submit this, and so on.</p>

<p>This Morning on the Tatsuta Maru to Investigate the Silk Industry</p>
<p>The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has determined that the grading and inspection methods for raw silk in the United States and Japan are generally in place. Starting in January next year, Japan will implement this compulsory inspection. Furthermore, in order to alleviate the recession in the silk industry, Japan has promulgated laws and various measures that are sufficient for our country to learn from. Therefore, Director Zou presented a request to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to dispatch Miao Zhongxiu, the director of the Raw Silk Inspection Office of the Bureau, along with technical officer Dr. Li Yaobang, to Japan for investigation. They are scheduled to depart this morning (July 11th) at 5:00 AM on the Tatsuta Maru for a three-week trip and return to Shanghai around the 2nd of next month. The important objectives of the investigation are: (1) The content of Japan's implementation of raw silk grading and inspection; (2) The current situation of the Japanese silk industry.

<h3 id="e194">American Women's Alliance Severely Protests the Opium Public Sales <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>The China National Anti-Narcotics Association recently received a protest letter from the American Women's Alliance in Washington, D.C., against the opium public sales in our country, requesting the association to convey this message. The translation is as follows: The American Women's Alliance is shocked and concerned about the news that your country is currently implementing opium public sales to expand the production, sale, and distribution of opium in order to increase tax revenue. Your country has always waged a clear war against narcotics, but now it has adopted a self-destructive policy, causing countless friends of China to be saddened and disappointed. The League of Nations recently published the report of the Far East Opium Investigation Team, which described on page 27 the impact of the spread of opium addiction on society and the economy: "The ability to work gradually decreases, and it is seen that the entire living force has the possibility of disappearing. Under this situation, we dare to conclude that the average opium addict has already reduced their ability to live by 50%. As for workers who smoke opium, they have to spend 40% to 70% of their wages every day to pay for smoking, and the amount left over for personal and family daily expenses is negligible." Your country's close friend, Bishop Brent, expressed his opinion at the Geneva International Opium Conference in 1924, saying, "Our greatest contribution to helping China is to lead the Chinese government to resist all temptations to establish an opium public sales agency, or to say that we do not use this evil trade to collect huge profits, others will also take it, or to think that a country that exploits human weaknesses and evils for tax revenue cannot become a dignified government. This kind of erroneous view is deeply painful." Based on the above reasons, it was resolved by this alliance to lodge a severe protest against the implementation of opium public sales by your government. We hope that your association will convey this message.</p>

<h3 id="e204">A Large-Scale International Club Planned <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>Initiated by an international banking syndicate</p>
<p>Meeting to be held on the 17th</p>
<p>An international club, established at the site of the Majestic Hotel, including its luxurious ballroom, to accommodate 2,000 members, will be formally discussed at a meeting convened at the offices of the Allied Building Company on July 17th. Mr. Li Fucun, General Manager of the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, and Mr. Spike, Manager of the Allied Building Company, jointly issued seventy invitations yesterday, inviting prominent Chinese and Western figures in Shanghai and business leaders to serve as initiators. The purchase of the Majestic Hotel, after being rejected by the foreign ratepayers at the Public Concession's annual meeting on April 15th, saw the Municipal Council relinquish its right to purchase. Consequently, the international banking syndicate acquired it for 3.5 million taels, divided into seven shares. These shares are held by the Allied Building Company, Mr. Li Fucun, and Mr. Chen Guangfu, representing the Chinese banks, Sir Robert Ho Tung, Sassoon &amp; Co., the Yangtse Finance Corporation, and the Probst, Hanbury &amp; Co., each holding one share. The international banking syndicate, recognizing the lack of international club facilities in Shanghai, considered it a deficiency. They proposed allocating a portion of the Majestic Hotel's premises, along with all its equipment and decorations, for the use of an international club, at a cost of 1.3 million taels. The ballroom would also continue to operate as a social hub. All handover procedures have been completed. The Majestic Hotel property covers a total of 58.593 mu, with over 23.5 mu allocated to the international club. We cannot help but admire the generosity of the international banking syndicate, considering the low cost. Given such favorable circumstances, the club's thriving future is predictable. As for the repayment plan, it is proposed to issue 6% debentures worth 1.4 million taels, with Chinese and Western individuals each subscribing to half. Thus, in addition to repaying the purchase price, there will be a surplus of 200,000 taels for development. Regarding membership, Mr. Li Fucun and Mr. Spike plan to have 500 shareholder members and 1,500 ordinary members. The club will hire one Chinese and one Western secretary each to manage the various affairs of this Shanghai social center. Additionally, an experienced European will be hired to serve as the hotel's manager. Mr. Zhang Qun, the Mayor of Shanghai, will be the first president of the club, while the vice president will be selected from among reputable Westerners in Shanghai. Female groups, regardless of nationality, are welcome to join. In addition to ordinary members, there will also be honorary members. Once formally established, a declaration will be issued stating that the club is purely a social organization and is not involved in politics. Regarding the purpose of establishing the international club, it is reported that Mr. Li Fucun and Mr. Spike will provide a brief explanation at the meeting on July 17th, emphasizing the spirit of true internationalism. Therefore, anyone residing in Shanghai, regardless of nationality, is eligible to become a member. The invitations issued to solicit initiators and participants for the July 17th meeting include the following individuals: Chinese side: Yu Qiaqing, Zhang Gongquan, Li Fucun, Chen Guangfu, Hu Mengjia, Liu Hongsheng, Rong Zongjing, Shi Liangcai, Xu Xinliu, Qian Xinzhi, Ye Zhuotang, Tang Shoumin, Qin Runqing, Robert Ho Tung, Chen Bingqian, Chen Zeqing, Chen Jian'an, Song Ziliang, Huang Rongliang, Wu Yunzhai, Zhu Boquan, Li Shuxiong, Xia Xiaofang, Zhou Zongliang, Cai Zengji, Wei Jingzhou, Dong Xian Guang, Zhang Zhuping, and others.

<p>Tables and chairs flew in the Hongyun Restaurant</p>
<p>Resulting in injuries to two people</p>
<p>At 10:15 last night, a violent fight broke out among workers of the French Tram Company at the Southeast Hongyun Restaurant, numbers 67-69, on the vegetable market road in the French Concession. Two people, a ticket seller and a driver, were injured on the spot. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Workers Divided into Two Factions <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>It is said that the entire workforce of the French Tram Company, located in various places, is mostly composed of local, Hubei, Shandong, and Jiangbei workers, divided into two major factions: the Liu faction, led by Liu Degong, a Shandong native and ticket inspector number 20, and the Li faction, led by Li Linshu, a Jiangbei native and inspector number 2.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Sending Public Contributions for Memorial Birthday <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>Since the entire group is divided into two factions, opinions inevitably diverge. Yesterday was the memorial birthday of the mother of Cai Hongjun, a local ticket seller number 18. Cai sent out invitations to a banquet at the Southeast Hongyun Restaurant, numbers 67-69 on Vegetable Market Road. A portion of the Shandong faction, about thirty people, initiated a collection of public contributions, with each person contributing three small silver coins to purchase a silk banner.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Light Gifts Served with Meager Dishes <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>At 10:00 last night, the guests gathered. Some of the workers from Cai's faction expressed dissatisfaction, believing that the three-coin public contribution was deliberately insulting to Cai. They immediately checked the gift registry and served a bowl of clear water and a table of the cheapest dishes to those who had participated in the three-coin public contribution and attended the banquet, as a form of retaliation. Unexpectedly, there were further twists and turns within.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Anger Transferred to the Initiators <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>It is said that some workers did not know that the public contribution was only three coins when they collected it. When they arrived at the Hongyun Restaurant and saw the host's meager treatment, they realized it contained a retaliatory motive. They then transferred their anger to some of the initiators of the public contribution. When the initiators arrived, they were attacked by the group. Tables, chairs, and miscellaneous objects were thrown down from upstairs. The two sides fought each other for a long time.</p>
<h3 id="e210">Resulting in Injuries to Two People <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>It is reported that one of the injured was driver number 164 and the other was ticket seller number 178. Upon hearing the news, the French police dispatched many detectives to suppress the situation. The streets were littered with broken chairs and benches, and onlookers blocked the road. The injured have been sent to the hospital by police car. The above situation was personally described by workers present at the scene.</p>
<h3 id="e211">Wife Sues Husband for Trafficking, Requests Divorce <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>Judge Advises Reconciliation</p>
<p>Plaintiff Firmly Opposes</p>
<p>Gao Chou, a Ningbo woman currently residing at number 84, Lower Sea Temple, has recently retained a lawyer to sue her husband for repeated trafficking and request a divorce from the Special District Court. The gist of her lawsuit is as follows: She was betrothed to the defendant, Gao Kangbao, as a child and married him at the age of seventeen. Because his family was poor, all living expenses were initially covered by pawning her dowry. However, he continued to wander and neglected his duties. Later, he had a far-fetched idea to sell the plaintiff. In March of the fifteenth year, the plaintiff came to Shanghai to work as a servant to earn a living. In December of the nineteenth year, the defendant tracked her down to Shanghai, hoping to live together. Considering that they were husband and wife, they formed a family in Mingyuan Fang on Huade Road. For a long time, they lived in harmony, but later he became acquainted with hooligans, repeatedly demanded money, and colluded with Wang A-jin, the second landlord, intending to sell her a second time. Upon learning of this, she opposed him, and he beat her. After someone intervened and persuaded him, she was spared. She was forced to request a divorce. Yesterday, Judge Zhou Daren heard the case in the civil court. The plaintiff first testified as above, stating that she was severely beaten on April 2nd of this year. She called the police, but after begging, she was not taken to the police station. After the police left, he became vicious again and threatened to sell her. She had no choice but to seek legal relief. Gao Kangbao denied the assault and trafficking, claiming that the plaintiff was having an affair with Wu Yongsheng, which is why she filed for divorce. Judge Zhou advised the plaintiff to drop the lawsuit and instructed the defendant to treat her well, so as to avoid separating after six years of marriage. However, Gao Chou was quite resolute and strongly opposed it. The debate then began and was declared closed, with a date set for sentencing.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Riverside Garden Opens in Minhang <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>Featuring Swimming Pools and Ball Courts</p>
<p>Shanghai-Minhang Shuttle Bus Service</p>
<p>Minhang Town, located southwest of Shanghai, is sixty li away. The town faces the river and borders a canal, creating a natural landscape. In the past, a local magnate, Mr. Li Yingshi, raised a large sum of money to purchase land and build the Shanghai-Minhang Highway, facilitating transportation. Trees are planted along both sides of the road, providing shade. During the summer, Chinese and Western people from Shanghai come to visit after work, constantly passing along the road or strolling along the river. However, there was no place to rest. This summer, the business community in the town opened a Riverside Garden on the southern end of the Shanghai-Minhang Road, along the Huangpu River. The garden features a ball court, swimming pool, Western-style restaurant, and small tile-roofed houses with elegant seating surrounded by bamboo fences. Under the shade of the trees, winding paths and thatched pavilions create a refreshing atmosphere. In recent days, the tourists coming are like clouds and all of them admired the scenery. The air is clean, beneficial to the body and mind. The scenery is especially good. The Shanghai-Minhang Long-Distance Bus Company opened a special shuttle bus service upon the passenger's request until 7:00 pm. Also, the garden has a lodge to accommodate guests. The riverbank has steamships for passengers to ride on, but regrettably, the supply often cannot meet the demand. Currently, a wealthy merchant has invested and surveyed the riverbank to build a world-class hotel, so that tourists from Europe and the Americas can come to experience the natural scenery of Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e213">Gonghexing Escapes Pirates, Runs Aground <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>The Beikou Sandboat Gonghexing recently loaded soybean oil and northern goods worth forty to fifty thousand taels from Yufeng Company in Dalian and set sail for Shanghai. However, when it sailed to the northwest of Jishan Island, it suddenly encountered a large group of pirates. Five or six pirate ships sailed onto the sea to inspect merchant ships. When they saw the Gonghexing approaching, the pirate ships surrounded it from all sides. Seeing this, the Gonghexing knew they were pirate ships and quickly set sail, but the pirate ships chased after it relentlessly and fired more than ten shots at the merchant ship. Several holes were shot in the Gonghexing's mast, and two crew members were wounded by bullets. There were more than twenty people on board the Gonghexing. Seeing two crew members injured, they tried their best to resist and simultaneously unfurled the sails and sped away. The pirate ships pursued them for two or three hours. Seeing that the Gonghexing was sailing very fast, they stopped chasing. The Gonghexing saw that the pirate ships were trailing behind them and the distance was gradually widening, and the crew's fear subsided slightly. Soon, the pirate ships disappeared, and they escaped danger. However, although the Gonghexing was not robbed by pirates, the crew was frightened and sailed in a panic. Because the sails were fully unfurled, the ship sailed too fast and ran aground on a sandbar in the middle of the Jishan sea. The bow of the ship was buried in the sandbar, causing damage. The soybean oil in the baskets was shaken and damaged, and the oil leaked out. The Gonghexing's owner, Mr. Lu, came to Shanghai from Haimen by boat to report the cargo number and hired a tugboat to tow the ship out of danger and unload the cargo to inspect the ship. It is reported that the losses suffered are already considerable.</p>

<p>Committed kidnapping and extortion in Qingpu County</p>
<p>Director Shen Meets Unexpectedly While on Business in Shanghai</p>
<p>Xu Aban, the leader of the Qingpu kidnapping gang, specialized in kidnapping and extortion cases in various places in the county. Recently, he kidnapped a wealthy household, Mr. Tang, in Fengao Pond, which belongs to the county. Later, Mr. Tang's family prepared money to redeem him. Shen Jinghua, the director of the county's Public Security Bureau, had repeatedly ordered the arrest of the bandit leader, but Xu's whereabouts were uncertain, making it difficult to arrest him. The day before yesterday, Director Shen, accompanied by Shi Baofu, a patrol officer of the county's water patrol team, came to Shanghai on business. Yesterday morning, at about 8:00 am, they met the bandit at Fengji Wharf in the South City. Director Shen immediately, together with Su Shenwu, a police officer from the first precinct of the first district, stepped forward to arrest Xu and took him back to the precinct. The precinct chief conducted a preliminary interrogation. Xu Aban confessed that he was thirty-four years old, from Kunshan, and currently residing at number 20, Qiufuli, Baek Road in the North City. He was managing trucks in the fire brigade on Baek Road. Regarding the Tang family in Fengao Pond, he kidnapped them because of a dispute with them.

<h3 id="e215">Young Girl Cooling Off in the Dark, Neighbor Uses It as an Excuse for Extortion <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>Claims She Was Committing Adultery in Public</p>
<p>Demands Seventy Dollars in Compensation</p>
<p>Xu Fen, a girl from Taizhou, is twenty-eight years old and has a fair appearance. Previously, due to the hardship of rural life and extreme poverty at home, she came to Shanghai with a fellow villager in January of this year and stayed at the boarding house opened by Miao Jutian at number 71, Hehe Workshop, Robert Road in western Shanghai. The owner of the boarding house helped her find work in a yarn factory to make a living. Since the girl was of marriageable age and had a smart demeanor, there were many people who coveted her. At about 10:00 pm the day before yesterday, the girl was cooling off nearby. A neighbor, Wang Deyi, went out on business. After walking a few steps, he suddenly caught sight of a man and a woman committing adultery in a dark place behind the house. Wang then stepped forward to investigate. The girl Xu ran away, and the man also escaped. At that time, Wang did not make any accusations. Yesterday morning, Wang gathered more than ten burly men and, with a menacing aura, rushed to Miao's boarding house, claiming that Miao's boarding house girl, Xu Fen, was committing adultery in public last night, offending his luck and causing him to have chills and fever. Miao needed to compensate him seventy dollars and host a feast, otherwise, they would resort to force. Upon hearing this, Miao was extremely shocked. He asked the girl, who denied it and claimed it was not true. Seeing that the situation was not good, Miao called the police to the scene, who arrested Wang Deyi and four others, along with the girl and Miao You, and took them all back to the sixth district police station, accusing Wang Deyi and others of gathering a crowd to extort money. After questioning by the district chief, according to the plaintiff Miao Jutian, he was fifty-two years old, from Taizhou, and operated a boarding house at number 71, Hehe Workshop. Today, Wang Deyi suddenly came and claimed that the boarding house girl Xu Fen was committing adultery along the road, offending his luck and demanding seventy dollars in extortion and hosting a feast. According to the girl Xu Fen's confession, she was sixteen years old, from Taizhou, and was cooling off with Miao You last night. She did not have any intimate relations with anyone. According to Miao You's confession, she was forty-nine years old, and her words were the same as those of the girl. According to the defendants' confessions, one named Wang Deyi, thirty-four years old, from Taizhou, worked in a factory; one named Luo Xiaosizi, twenty-nine years old, from Qingjiang; one named Li Hailin, twenty-six years old, from Yangzhou; one named Zeng Dayuan, twenty-nine years old, from Qingjiang; and one named Bai Changhai, thirty-five years old, from Qingjiang. After obtaining the confessions, the district chief considered the case to involve gathering a crowd to extort money and prepared a document to transfer it to the General Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e216">Two Slaps on the Head Lead to Death <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>The Deceased's Family Claims Loss of Soul Caused Death</p>
<p>Xu Xiaozizi, the sixteen-year-old daughter of Xu Gao, a woman from Yancheng, who lived on a boat at Lujiazui in Pudong, had been picking chicken feathers in a chicken feather shop. Five days ago, while working, she suddenly dozed off. A female worker, Zhu Zhou, jokingly slapped her head twice. Xiaozizi suddenly got scared and after she returned home, she suffered from chills and fever, eventually dying the day before yesterday. Xu Gao then dragged Zhu Zhou to the third district police station, accusing her of causing her death by beating and losing her soul. The police station immediately sent her to the local court. Yesterday, Xie Along, the bailiff of the 24th map, reported the autopsy to the local court.</p>
<h3 id="e217">Pudong Extortionist Confesses <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>Jiang Xiguang Tries His Best to Expose</p>
<p>Zhai Miaogen Confesses to Writing Letters</p>
<p>Jiang Xiguang and Zhai Miaogen, from Pudong, were arrested for repeatedly writing threatening letters between last autumn and June of this year to extort a large sum of money from Jiang Weibin, a local resident at number 16, Fengtian Road. The arrests were made by Chinese and Western detectives from the Harbin police station. Qian Zhenmiao, also a local resident, was arrested for being implicated in the case, but after questioning, the court determined that he was not involved in the case and was released on bail with the condition that he be available for questioning at any time. The charges against Jiang and Di remained. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xieqian presided over a hearing in the third criminal court. The police lawyer, Li Zhishan, presented the case, stating that no other cases had been discovered during the postponement. When questioned, Jiang Xiguang firmly stated, "I am a relative and foster brother of the plaintiff and would never do such a thing. On the day of my arrest, I recognized that the handwriting on the threatening letters was Zhai's, so I had my father secretly lead the police detectives to arrest him. How could he not hate me? That is why he is incriminating me in court. His behavior is despicable. From a loan incident, it can be seen that he used someone else's name to borrow money from lenders, and therefore I broke off relations with him. If I had conspired with him in this case, I would gladly be shot. Moreover, the location agreed upon in the threatening letters was a pit latrine near the Longwang Temple in Pudong, right across from his residence, to observe the situation." When questioned, Zhai Miaogen confessed, "The facts are that Jiang Xiguang instructed me. Before, in a loan incident, he was indeed the one who borrowed money from others as collateral, but he used a small amount, so it did not suit his purpose. He came to me for money. Before this incident occurred, Jiang Xiguang came and said that the plaintiff Jiang Weibin had recently sold a house for 120,000 yuan, so he repeatedly came to me to write the threatening letters. Because Jiang knew his handwriting, he is now arrested and cannot deny it. I request the court to impose a lenient sentence because I have a blind father and a wife and children in their sixties who depend on me for support. If I am given a long-term sentence, my family will starve to death." As he spoke, tears welled up in his eyes. Jiang Xiguang, hearing this, loudly said, "His father is a well-known gangster in that area. Please, Your Honor, punish him severely." Judge Xiao verified the confessions and instructed both sides' lawyers to argue their cases before ordering that they be remanded in custody pending sentencing.</p>

<h3 id="e220">The First Sound of Zhonghe Shaole <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>Our country's music, since ancient times, has regarded Zhonghe Shaole as the highest and most valuable music, which is what Confucius called perfect and beautiful music. Its advantage is that it can withstand full research. The dynasties of all ages have respected and valued it. They promulgated its score to all provinces and counties, and selected outstanding disciples from the scholars to serve in the music and dance positions (named Yisheng, commonly known as half-head scholars), whose qualifications were equal to today's middle school graduates. The country was very grand, but the people in charge (education officials, county officials, etc.) did not know how to seek truth from facts, but instead encroached on public funds from it, so that many musical instruments were incomplete and inaccurate. At ordinary times, they did not supervise the Yisheng's practice, only rehearsing once or twice a year during the grand sacrifice. The performers didn't know what they were playing, and how could the listeners hear it. The Datong Music Society in this city has always been committed to organizing national music. The basic work must be based on Shaole as the premise. The entire orchestra members of the association have taken on the responsibility of practicing. The musical instruments used are based on the Yuan Dynasty system. (All musical instruments used in the Yuan Dynasty's worship of Confucius are collected.) Those that can be collected are also used. Coincidentally, this music is mature. It coincided with the 50th anniversary of Mr. Yu Yeqing, who was one of the committee members recommended by the association. It is appropriate to celebrate together, and the crown cover is very prosperous, which is a good opportunity for publicity. It is scheduled to be held on Saturday and Tuesday at the Italian Hall of the Majestic Hotel for the first performance. Shaole, which has been respected for thousands of years, is now suddenly revived in the world and performed publicly. The ears and eyes are refreshed. Isn't it a grand event? It is also heard that the association is also planning ancient dances, either running a primary school or contacting nearby primary schools to select 64 students and teach them various ancient dances to achieve perfection.</p>

<p>Twenty-two passengers and crew members fall into the water with the ship</p>
<p>A cucumber vendor, Mr. Wang, drowns on the spot</p>
<p>A ship belonging to the Wusong shipping household, Gao Ayu, specializes in running between Song and Shanghai, carrying cargo. The day before yesterday, the ship loaded salted goods, dried fish, and northern and southern goods worth two or three thousand gold from Yushun, Huang Changfa, Wanchunshun, and other companies in Shanghai and set sail for Song. At about 2 pm, when it reached the Yangshupu Donggou port, an Yihua Company's Rising Sun Liner was exiting. The liner passed by the ship from behind. The ship accidentally caught the liner's small rowing boat with its masts and sails, which was difficult to pull apart for a while. Unexpectedly, the ship's helmsman panicked and released the rudder, causing the ship to capsize. The cargo was all submerged, and four crew members and eighteen passengers fell into the water with the ship. Except for twenty-one people who climbed out of the cabin and stood on the bottom of the ship, a passenger, Mr. Wang, a Yang peddler who was forty-seven years old and sold cucumbers for a living, drowned on the spot. The body has not yet been recovered. The ship has now sunk to the bottom of the sea. It is reported that the shipowner, Gao Ayu, is unwilling to go to salvage the cargo.</p>

After being discovered, the incident was reported to Chang Zhenshan, the watchman at the No. 13 sentry post on nearby Linyin Road, who then reported it to Chief Wang of the Second District. Chief Wang ordered a patrol officer to investigate and first had the body extracted. He also instructed the local administrator to report to the local court for an inquest. It is reported that the deceased had an elder brother and uncle doing business in Shanghai, and the factory owner, Ni Xiqing, has instructed someone to notify them.</p>

<p>The late Mr. Zhang Shisheng of Haimen, former Standing Committee Member of the National Federation of Traditional Chinese Medicine Organizations, devoted his life to the cause of Chinese medicine for nearly thirty years. His knowledge and experience were highly respected throughout the country. Unfortunately, last winter, while attending the inaugural meeting of the Central National Medical Hall, he overworked himself and caught a cold. He passed away from illness on April 16th of this year in his hometown of Haimen. The news of his death shocked and saddened both the national medical and pharmaceutical communities.

<p>This Month, the 18th</p>
<p>Purely Buddhist land in our country, combining the two scenic beauties of sea and mountain, and the supreme Pure Land of Buddhism, is Putuo. Every summer, there are many tourists, but because the voyage is circuitous and takes time, travelers often feel inconvenienced. The Jingwu Athletic Association's travel group, in view of this, has chartered the Dahua Steamboat on the 18th of this month for a special trip. It will depart at 4:00 PM and arrive at Putuo at 6:00 AM the next morning. At 4:00 PM that afternoon, it will return to Shanghai on the same ship, arriving in Shanghai at 6:00 AM on the 20th. The fee is divided into seven types, ranging from five yuan to sixteen yuan. Except for the different levels of cabins, the treatment for food and other items is the same. Because the association has found that the number of people on board during previous trips to Putuo has been too crowded, this time, in order to ensure the comfort of the travelers, the quota is limited to 400 people, and registration will be closed when the quota is full.</p>

Starting from the 15th of this month in the Gregorian calendar, he will provide diagnosis and medicine at the clinic of Dr. Hou Kangbo at the temple, with a daily quota of 50 people, limited to one month.</p>

<p>Based on the French Franc</p>
<p>International wireless telegraph rates were reduced starting yesterday. The amount of the reduction is based on the French franc.

<p>Publication of "Shanghai's People's Food Problem"</p>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs established a Grain Commission in the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, with the approval of the government, to specialize in the study of all people's food problems. As there was no special work on the study of people's food in the market, the members of the committee wrote special works on various aspects of the people's food problem, focusing on the entire people's food problem, not limited to the city of Shanghai. The bureau's food administration over the years, and the Grain Commission's suggestions and reforms regarding food, were also attached to provide a reference for food administration. The book is now published, entitled "Shanghai's People's Food Problem." It is being sold by the Commercial Press and the Civilization Bookstore both locally and in other cities. The book contains more than 300,000 words, is beautifully bound, and contains thousands of illustrations. Mayor Yuejun once commented on the book, saying, "We believe that this article is not only an aid to the study of the people's food problem in Shanghai, but also those who are concerned about the people's food problem in China should have a copy in hand." This shows the content of the book.</p>

<p>To whom it may concern:</p>
<p>Having read in today's edition of your esteemed newspaper the article regarding the resolution of the strike by employees of the French Municipal Council, which stated, "Wang Zhuangyong, Liu Zhigang, Tao Qipeng, and others served as negotiating committee members, and after lengthy discussions, both parties agreed and signed a resolution," I humbly believe that Mr. Tao Qipeng and I were elected as members of the Executive Committee, and we are aware of our limited abilities and heavy responsibilities and fear of failure. However, due to the public interest, we must strive to fulfill our duties. As for the negotiating representatives this time, they were Liu Zhigang, Gao Pengcheng, Qiu Gaogang, Yang Wugang, Peng Quanfu, Wang Yaogen, Pan Wenqing, Sun Shanhai, and eight others. Mr. Tao and I not only did not represent them in signing the agreement but also did not attend the negotiations at the Du residence. I am deeply concerned that this may cause misunderstandings among the employees of our association, so I am writing to request an immediate correction. Respectfully submitted to the editor of the Shenbao.</p>
<p>Wang Zhuangyong, Preparatory Office of the Chinese United Association of the French Concession. July 10th.</p>
<p>Esteemed Mr. Editor:</p>
<p>I am writing to you regarding the news item in the local news section of your July 5th edition concerning a divorce case involving a barren woman, and the statement that she received some form of compensation. This does not correspond with the facts. Since the beginning of this matter, your esteemed newspaper has shown care and provided detailed coverage, for which I am extremely grateful. However, based on the insistence of both parties' parents, I hired a lawyer to draw up an agreement for a divorce without any compensation whatsoever. I respectfully request a correction. With best wishes.</p>

<p>This chapter describes the origins of the extraterritorial roads, the process of their extension, and how the Municipal Council gradually developed a partial administrative management system for the extraterritorial roads and the houses accessing them. Tracing its outline, the report indicates that the development of the extraterritorial roads began as early as 1862 and 1863. At that time, as the Taiping Rebellion was nearing its end, the public concessions were crowded with refugees, and the foreign community believed that there was a need to expand the land west of the concessions to provide recreational areas. The new racecourse, located outside the western boundary, was opened in 1862. The carriage road starting from the Mud City Creek and ending at Jing'an Temple, which soon became known as Jing'an Temple Road, was also opened in the same year. This carriage road was originally operated by a private entity, and only those who had contributed funds and paid tolls could use it. However, the committee found that the income was insufficient for various purposes, so at the taxpayers' annual meeting in April 1866, a motion was passed authorizing the next Board of Directors of the Municipal Council to take over the management of Wusong Road, Jing'an Temple Road, and the surrounding roads, which Mr. Keswick, the then-Chairman of the Municipal Council, referred to as the "lungs of Shanghai." After the passage of this motion, the Municipal Council took over Jing'an Temple Road and Xujiahui Road (now Haig Road). To understand the state of the villages outside the boundaries of the public concessions in the past, one only needs to observe the current state of the places where the Municipal Council's roads near Shanghai ended. Although there was development on the suburban land adjacent to both sides of these roads, the extent of the development was very short, except for one or two miles. Generally speaking, the villages outside the boundary in the past had no roads to speak of; the creeks and country paths were the means of transportation. Therefore, foreigners inside and outside the boundary believed that their movement would be greatly restricted if roads were not built to connect to the nearby suburbs. Between 1853 and 1863, several roads were hastily designed and built for military needs to connect outside of the concessions. It is said that these military roads were built by General Gordon, including Xujiahui Road "Haig Road," the section of Xinzha Road west of Xizang Road to Jing'an Temple Road, Maigen Road, and a road leading to Zhaojiaodu. After the end of military operations, how to maintain these roads in the future became an important issue. The Chinese authorities were not prepared to take any action, but the foreigners in the concessions paid attention to this issue and tried to urge the Municipal Council to assume this maintenance responsibility. In 1869, the Municipal Council proposed to the Daotai (local governor) the conditions under which the Council would assume responsibility for maintaining certain roads, including three points: (1) the land through which the roads passed should be exempt from land tax; (2) the Daotai should provide financial assistance for road repairs; and (3) a guarantee should be given that the Daotai would adopt "effective and resolute measures to prevent the Chinese from destroying public property." The 1868 Municipal Council Annual Report contained a report from the Works Committee stating that the Municipal Council had been notified that the Daotai had consulted with Sir Alcock and agreed to donate 1,200 yuan annually to cover the maintenance costs of roads outside the concession. This amount was considered insufficient at the time, and in fact, it seems that no funds were ever donated. The issue of road tax was related to the issue of maintaining the road so that it would not be damaged, as can be seen in the report of Mr. Medhurst, the British Consul in 1871. The report mentioned the fact that local owners of land used for road construction would often cut the road surface and destroy bridges in retaliation because they had to bear the obligation of paying land tax on the land. The issue of paying land tax on land used for road construction inside and outside the public concessions was often the subject of negotiations between the Municipal Council and the Chinese authorities. This issue was resolved in 1885. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Ants Heal Wounds</p>
<p>Ants are tiny insects in the insect world. How could they heal wounds? However, in Peru, South America, this is indeed the case. Recently, a British tourist group went to visit. It is said that they personally witnessed local doctors using ants to treat external injuries because there is a kind of ant in Peru that has a unique and powerful jaw. As long as they are placed where they can bite, they will immediately open their mouths and bite firmly, not letting go. Therefore, if the natives suffer any injuries to their skin, they seek treatment from a doctor. The doctor will squeeze the wound tightly together and pick up an ant from the ground and place it on the wound, with its head touching the injured area. It will immediately bite with its large jaws, sewing the wound together. Then, the doctor will cut off the ant's body and place other ants on the wound, one by one, in the same way, until the entire wound is completely sewn up. Such a treatment method is truly unheard of.</p>
<p>Crocodile Reward</p>
<p>In the Berlin Zoo in Germany, a thousand crocodiles were once transported from America, ready for display. The director of the zoo, in order to make the public aware, used a large balloon to fly over the zoo grounds, attracting the attention of the audience. The balloon had large words written on it: "One Thousand Crocodiles." However, the weight of the balloon was too heavy, and the anchor tying it down was relatively light. Before long, the balloon soared into the sky, reaching over nine thousand feet, and gradually disappeared. Therefore, the director of the zoo took advantage of this opportunity to publicize the event widely, saying that anyone who found the balloon and returned it to the zoo would be rewarded with a live crocodile, a promise that would not be broken.</p>

<p>— Jiaolou</p>
<p>It is often the case that there are people with the same names in ancient and modern times. Since Emperor Yuan of Liang had a book called "A Record of People with the Same Names in Ancient and Modern Times," many people have continued to write such records. Recent names, such as Xu Shichang, Jiang Chaozong, Zhang Hu, Ma Liang, and Wang Zhen, all existed in ancient times. There is also a Shanghai police officer named Zhang Liang, who also belongs to this category. Now, I will take a few cases of people with the same names recorded in the Shanghai news of this newspaper in recent years and offer some other interpretations for amusement. The dates of publication have mostly been forgotten, but I think readers should still have them in mind.</p>
<p>Su Xun Posts an Advertisement to Find a Husband for His Daughter</p>
<p>Note: Su Xun is Su Laoquan of the Song Dynasty. His daughter, Su Xiaomei, was proud of her talent and was very picky in choosing a spouse. The novel's description of the three difficulties for the groom can summarize it. It is fitting that his advertisement to find a husband must be in the form of a public announcement.</p>
<p>Meng Haoran Causes Trouble While Drinking</p>
<p>Note: Li Bai's poem to Meng Haoran says, "Often intoxicated by the moon, he does not serve the ruler because of flowers." It is known that Haoran liked to drink. But he did not have the style of Guan Fu scolding people while sitting, so why would he cause trouble? This is why he is the Meng Haoran of Zhabei. (The newspaper reported that the person lived in Zhabei)</p>
<p>Zhao Ziang Falls from a Horse</p>
<p>Note: Zhao Ziang is Zhao Mengfu. He was famous at the time for his skill in painting horses. Even today, obtaining an inch of his painting is hailed as a precious treasure. How could he be known for falling from a horse? Perhaps the son of a good doctor must die from medicine, and the son of a good shaman must die from ghosts. Someone who is good at painting horses must suffer from horses. Just a laugh.</p>
<p>Song Yu is Smeared</p>
<p>Note: Song Yu was a handsome man from Chu. There was a girl next door who spied on him for three years. It is to be expected that Song Yu would be smeared. The new criminal law also has a clause for women raping men. But the current Song Yu is not male but female. If she marries the Song Yu of Chu, they would truly be a perfect match.</p>
<h3 id="e259">The Capital After the Heavy Rain <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Xingyuan</p>
<p>For the past ten days, the weather has been hot and humid, making people feel stifled. Although it is already summer, the climate is so sultry that we have long anticipated that heavy rain would fall soon. Then, on the evening of the third day, dark clouds filled the sky, thunder roared, and torrential rain poured down continuously. Everywhere was a sea of white water, almost turning into a swamp. It has truly been a rare sight in more than ten years. I will record what I have seen and heard and tell the readers.</p>
<p>Water Accumulates on Zhongshan Road</p>
<p>The most prominent road in the capital is the newly built Zhongshan Road, which is flat and wide, almost comparable to Nanjing Road in Shanghai. After the heavy rain, the water had not yet been drained, and it accumulated to a foot deep. The lower places are even worse. Pedestrians had to lift their clothes to pass, with the water almost reaching their knees. Cars sped back and forth, splashing water, truly a spectacular sight.</p>
<p>Rickshaw Pullers Profit Threefold</p>
<p>The water had risen greatly, and pedestrians had a great sigh of helplessness. As a result, rickshaws were all booked up, and prices rose by two or three times. The rickshaw pullers were overjoyed, but running wildly in the rain, their clothes soaked, was also a hardship.</p>
<p>Fashionable Young Ladies in a Dilemma</p>
<p>When the reporter went from Xiaguan to Xinjiekou for business, the rain was still light. Passing through Gulou, there were two young ladies wearing silk stockings and leather shoes, dressed beautifully, walking on the road. Suddenly, torrential rain poured down, and they could not avoid it. Their bodies were completely drenched, like chickens that had fallen into the water. It was laughable and also pitiful.</p>
<p>The Water in the Qinhuai River Almost Reached the Banks</p>
<p>After this heavy rain, the water in the Qinhuai River also rose several feet, almost reaching the banks. If there is no sign of clear weather, the houses on both sides will all be in the water.</p>
<p>People from Jiangbei Cry Out in Misery</p>
<p>People from Jiangbei gathered in the Xiaguan area, living in sheds. The ground was all low-lying. After the rain, the water rose, and many sheds collapsed. Those that did not collapse were all immersed in water, making it difficult to find a place to settle down. Everyone had a sad look on their faces, and their condition was extremely pitiful.</p>
<p>The River Water Rose Violently and Vastly</p>
<p>Since the beginning of summer, the water level in the Yangtze River has risen remarkably. After this heavy rain, the river water rose even more than ten feet, vast and surging, almost reaching the banks. In addition, the violent wind blew and stirred up angry waves, which were irresistible. It was also a spectacular sight.</p>
<h3 id="e260">Talking About the Nail Decoration of Parisian Women <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— Yanyu</p>
<p>Paris is the most prosperous city in the world, which has long been famous. Its pursuit of extravagance in makeup is unparalleled. Even London and New York cannot compare. Recently, women in that country have been competing to decorate their nails as an elegant activity in their boudoirs, fighting each other for innovation, and it has become a popular trend. I will excerpt a few examples to share with readers.</p>
<p>Identifying Women by Their Nails</p>
<p>In today's French society, if we want to identify whether a woman is fashionable or not, we only need to examine the nails of her slender fingers to see if they have undergone exquisite decoration. Nowadays, almost all French women who slightly frequent social occasions no longer want to retain the natural beauty of their nails without adding color or drawing patterns.</p>
<p>Nails and Dresses in the Same Color</p>
<p>If we stroll through the streets of Paris, we can immediately see that the color of the nail polish on women's nails is often the same as the color of their dresses. At present, the most popular women's clothing material in Paris is light blue, so the nails of those women are mostly dyed light blue to match. This method of dyeing nails is very simple, like using rouge for cheeks or lipstick for lips. However, before dyeing, a layer of colloidal water needs to be applied to prevent fading. However, it can also be wiped off at any time, so the nail polish of fashionable women often changes several times a day depending on their dresses.</p>
<p>Spending a Fortune on Painting Nails</p>
<p>Parisian dancer Meiboli earns more than ten times more per month than the French president, and her extravagant lifestyle is comparable to that of a queen or concubine. Her clothing and makeup are always imitated by fashionable women all over the country. Whenever Meiboli has a new outfit, it will become popular on the market in a few days. Since the trend of nail decoration became popular, ladies have come up with new styles one after another and have made many contributions. Recently, she specially hired the famous French painter Stederborg to paint exquisite and delicate colorful flowers and birds on each nail. From then on, the snow-white skin and slender fingers are even more beautiful with the famous paintings, making them even more charming. It is said that the cost of painting the nails is no less than a thousand US dollars.</p>

<h3 id="e262">Random Thoughts on Traveling in Korea (2) <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>— Jiping</p>
<p>Regarding the anti-Chinese riot in Korea, according to Mr. Hayashi, the representative of the Japanese Chargé d'Affaires, Mr. Shigemitsu, when he visited the Korean Foreign Minister, it has returned to stability. However, bad news has come that our country's Consulate General was destroyed by rioters on the night of the 8th. Not a single piece of equipment or document survived. Consulate staff have temporarily taken refuge in the Governor-General's Office. Among the 3,000 Chinese expatriates seeking refuge in the consulate, many have been killed or injured, a truly tragic sight. The Korean authorities have neither protected foreign nationals nor even provided safe protection for the diplomatic representatives of friendly nations. The so-called "nearby, one does not hear the sound of thunder; staring, one does not see the shape of Mount Tai" is a truly bizarre failure of responsibility. In today's world with might but without justice, to whom can we appeal? But we must uphold justice and declare the truth to the world.</p>
<p>Speaking of the Korean Consulate General, I am filled with anger. I remember when I was in Seoul, I went there every day to visit friends. Upon entering the gate, there was a Chinese expatriate elementary school. The interior of the consulate had high-rise buildings that were twice as spacious as the Japanese Embassy in Tokyo. The gardens were full of fragrant grass and beautiful flowers, and the trees were lush, with very beautiful scenery. Recalling that when Yuan Shikai was the Commercial Commissioner, the flat buildings behind the consulate were all the barracks for his guards. When he went out, he was surrounded by guards in front and behind, with great pomp and circumstance. There were Chinese police in the city, and Chinese training grounds outside the city. The right to govern was in our hands, and the Koreans sang praises. Later, after the defeat in the Sino-Japanese War, Korea was annexed by Japan, and all special rights were completely revoked. Looking at those flat buildings now, leaning and dilapidated, the sight is full of sadness. The consulate is running out of funds and allows them to be broken. It is already a feeling of the past and the present. Unfortunately, it was suddenly destroyed. Thinking of the chaotic state, I don't know what the readers will think.</p>
<p>The Korean people's views on China can be roughly divided into four factions. The elderly people over fifty years old are still kind. They recall that during the eighth year of Guangxu, Li Hongzhang, Wu Changqing, and other former sages led troops across the sea to quell the Korean internal rebellion. They also remember the merits of Admiral Wu Zhaoyou's two suppressions of the internal rebellion. They also constantly remember China's past assistance to Korea and hope that after China becomes strong as soon as possible, it can help their weak nation again. Most ambitious young people are unwilling to succumb to the violent oppression of Japanese imperialism and come to China to participate in the revolution or study academics. They hold a "never share the same sky" determination against Japan and especially hope that our country's revolution will succeed as soon as possible. There are also a small number of young people in the country who have received sufficient education. Although they feel the pain of national subjugation, they are not free and can only resentfully pass the years. However, those factions are in the minority. The largest number of young people have been anesthetized by slavery education since childhood. They do not know what kind of nation they are or the past history of Korea and have almost assimilated into the Japanese. That group of young people is fundamentally hopeless. The crowd in this riot is also this generation of pitiable enslaved people. Now, we can only hope that the kind elderly and the revolutionary Korean youth will rise up and awaken that group of ignorant fools.</p>

<p>— Xu Zhuodai</p>
<p>Ziliang ignored her and continued to do his own thing. The wife had no other choice, so she went downstairs. As soon as she got downstairs, she immediately came back up, holding a fast letter from Nanjing:</p>
<p>"When did this arrive? Why didn't you tell me?"</p>
<p>"It came when you were watching the grand funeral procession with such fascination. After you came back, you were so eager to admire the playboy's sister-in-law that I didn't have time to tell you."</p>
<p>At this time, she had already opened the letter and read it. She immediately became excited:</p>
<p>"What time is it now?"</p>
<p>She came over and looked at the watch on her husband's left arm:</p>
<p>"It's 2:05. It's almost time. I need to go change my clothes. You should change your clothes too."</p>
<p>"What's the matter? Who's letter is this?"</p>
<p>"Don't you know? This is a letter from my good friend, Ye Yunyu. She's coming to Shanghai from Nanjing today. She should arrive at our house at 2:30. Let's go change our clothes."</p>
<p>"Why should I change my clothes just because she's coming?"</p>
<p>At this time, Ziliang thought of Ye Yunyu and became worried, because Ye Yunyu was another troublemaker. She was very small, but her voice was very loud. Therefore, Ziliang gave her a nickname, calling her Cicada. She was Yueru's classmate and had always lived in Shanghai. Last year, her husband got a job at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, so she moved her family there. Ziliang's house has not seen Cicada since. She is Yueru's good friend. The two of them together, how can anything get done today?</p>
<p>"You're so embarrassing! Yunyu's husband has become an official. You've been messing around for years and are still just a schoolteacher. Aren't you ashamed? If you go out to meet a guest in an old cotton gown, my face will be completely ruined."</p>
<p>"Officials are certainly respectable, and playboys are also wealthy. In your eyes, only schoolteachers are poor?"</p>
<p>Yueru ignored him and rushed to the front room. At the same time, she called the nanny to come upstairs to help her open the suitcase, find clothes, wash her face, and apply powder, which greatly affected the small attic. After a while, the nanny went downstairs. Presumably, she had finished her makeup. The sound of high-heeled shoes suddenly appeared in the small attic, and a neatly dressed lady appeared.</p>

<p>Financial Specie (Gold Standard) Reversal and Decline</p>
<h3 id="e264">Decline of Ten Taels and Five Mace <a href="#e264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Specie (Gold Standard) tended to reverse, and declined again. The situation was unstable, fluctuating throughout the day around 730 taels, with a difference of more than nine taels between the highs and lows. As a result, it fell by ten taels and some odd mace, showing great twists and turns. Traders were at a loss. Although the silver market fell, it was unmoved. Inquiries suggested that although American silver was slightly lower, sellers were still scarce, and stocks turned slightly gentler, resulting in a lower opening for gold prices. Later, buyers showed strength, and with stable foreign exchange rates and no price changes, it rose again, once rising above 734 taels. However, speculators sold off, resulting in a setback, with a slight fluctuation of two or three taels. The market later became weaker and weaker, and the situation worsened. In fact, it was because the British exchange rate seemed to loosen, and banks were willing to sell. In addition, various firms tended to sell off, and finally fell to about 725 taels. Afterwards, the decline stopped, and peace returned. It is said that large bars are expected to rise this morning.</p>
<h3 id="e265">Agricultural Development Immediately Fell Eight Taels and Two Mace <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>The opening price for August this morning immediately fell by eight taels and two mace, to 729 taels. However, the evening closing price on the previous day had already fallen to 32 taels, which was actually the aftermath. The price of large bars of silver fell by one-quarter, and the price of silver also shrank by one-quarter. Private telegrams fell by three-eighths, but the European market was firm, and there were many sellers in the market. Shunli, Wanxing, Dadecheng, Zhifengyong, Hengyu and others all sold, so the price fell from 30 taels to 27 taels. The bars suddenly turned upwards, because Qianchangxiang and the Dalian Gang came to buy again, and Hengxing, Yongfeng, etc. all entered. As for British gold, it fluctuated slightly. HSBC initially took half a penny, and then Zhengjin and others sold half a penny. Then China Bank offered 0.4375, so the gold price jumped by six or seven taels, with one or two taels of turnover in between. At around 9:30, it was 34 taels. The first order was not changed, but Tongtaichang and others sold off, so it retreated to 31 and a half taels. British gold for October could be settled at half a penny. Afterwards, Hengyu, Yuanmaoyong, Hengxing, Zhifengyong, Wanxing and others went on the market and rose, and pulled up three taels again. At around 10:30, it was 34 taels and four mace. Afterwards, Tongtaichang, Senchangyong, Qianchangxiang, Yiyu and others all came to sell, dropping more than seven taels in one go. However, there was a rise and fall of one or two taels. The exchange rate seemed to loosen, and the bank bought British gold at 0.5625, so at 11:00, it was only 27 taels. Later, Fuyu, Dadecheng and hedgers came in, and it rose by more than four taels, to 31 and a half taels. In a moment, it was suppressed by more than three taels, because Yuanheng, Yuanxingyong and others sold off. At 11:30, the Indian exchange telegram had shrunk by two annas, and then rose by three taels, to 31 and a half taels. However, the sellers were still strong, and in just four or five minutes, it retreated to 29 taels. The noon closing price was 29 taels and six mace, and then it was made to 28 taels and some odd mace. The posted price was still calculated at 771 taels, which was clamped down from 27/28 taels to 43/44 taels. The noon closing was 41/42 taels.</p>

<p>The market opened at 27 taels 5 mace, then 29 taels 5 mace.  Another firm arrived to participate, but due to a large exchange report, it fell to 27 taels 8 mace. After 2:15 PM, buying activity on the surface began to rise.  This was because British gold was snapped up by various firms for 5625, so at 2:30 PM it was 32 taels.  Ten minutes later, it retreated to 29 taels 5 mace because HSBC offered August half-pence.  By 3:00 PM, it had risen another 2 taels to 31 taels 5 mace.  After that, it hovered around 30 taels.  Close to 4:00 PM, it was suddenly heard that banks were selling half-pence British gold.  It was likely that Richang, Yutai, Hongli, and others colluded to sell, and in an instant, the waves were turbulent, leading to dire straits and a fall of 5-6 taels.  Finally, at 4:15 PM, it closed at 24 taels 8 mace.  At this time, Yongfeng and others bought in, and HSBC snapped up another 5625 in British gold, immediately pulling it up more than 2 taels to 27 taels 2 mace.  By the closing at 4:30 PM, it was 26 taels 7 mace, a decline of 10 taels 5 mace compared to the previous day.  Trading then continued to 28 taels, as Wanxing and others bought in.  Based on the highest price before and after the market of 34 taels 4 mace and the lowest price of 24 taels 8 mace, there was a fluctuation of 9 taels 6 mace.  Spot goods were 30 taels in the morning market, 29 taels at noon, 8 taels 2 mace in the afternoon, and 28 taels 5 mace at the close.  The price of goods was pressed from 43 taels to 39 taels, and then back to 43 taels.  Book entries were from 33 taels to 30 taels, with 33 taels for replenishing water. The afternoon was 30 taels.</p>
<h3 id="e267">Spot Market Rises 11 Taels 5 Mace <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>Several hundred taels of spot bare silver were taken in by Yingfeng Hengjin, sold by the Northern Gang, with the price increasing by 11 taels 5 mace according to the gold price. However, demand was not strong, and prices were feared to be difficult to rise.</p>
<h3 id="e268">More Transactions Out Than In <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>Furthermore, transaction statistics from each firm show that Zhifeng Yong, Cuichang Yong, Zhimao Yong, Hengxing, Shunli, Yuda, Yuanxing Yong, and others all bought in, while Tongtaichang, Fuchang, Senchang Yong, Hengxing Yuan, Futaiheng, Chengfeng Yong, and Yuantai all sold out. Dadecheng, Qianchangxiang, and Hengyu had many transactions both in and out. In the afternoon, Yuanmao Yong and Yuanxing Yong both bought in, while Zhifeng Yong, Qianchang Yong, and Yuda bought in and then sold out again. Tongtaichang, Shunli, Wanxing, Cuichang Yong, Hengxing Yuan, Yuantai, Futaiheng, Yuanheng, Richang, and others all sold out. The Guangdong Gang bought in more than 500 bars, while the Dalian Gang had about 4,000 bars in and out, roughly balancing out.</p>
<h3 id="e269">Foreign Exchange Domestic Market Slightly Looser <a href="#e269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the British, American, and Indian silver markets all reported declines, but the market was stable and firm, and sellers were not active.  As a result, the Shanghai market was flat.

<p>Japan's Export Trade Is Still Prosperous</p>
<p>The overall trend of the yarn market is flat, because the overseas situation is becoming more downstream, a certain merchant is still selling, the quota is particularly huge, there is talk of delivery, and people's hearts are therefore softened, but there are also some who hold on to futures and do not release them, this is because Japan's export trade is very prosperous. Yesterday, Shenxin sold another 16 and 20 count "Ren Zhong" yarn for a total of 4,500 bales, for the July-August period, so the futures bids are tight, and the market atmosphere is unusually tight. However, the inventory of coarse yarn is too thick, and it is found that there are about 23-4,000 bales in the yarn warehouse.</p>

<p>At the opening of the exchange's futures bids, the market was tired because American cotton had fallen for two consecutive days and some big players were selling. Each month fell by 5, 6, 7 qian. In the afternoon, it was heard that the export business of labeled yarn was still booming, and the market atmosphere was slightly firm, rising by 1, 2, 3 qian each. The turnover was 21,800 bales. It was found that Ruidai sold 2,750 bales, Yuda 1,050 bales, Meiji 900 bales, and Heshen 900 bales. Changfeng bought 1,150 bales, Lichang 1,700 bales, Taixing 1,300 bales, Shenchang 950 bales, and Taishengkang 800 bales. The closing price of futures bids is recorded on the left.</p>

<p>Japanese Merchants Continue to Absorb Long-Term New Cotton</p>
<p>The cotton market is slightly depressed, because the situation of American cotton is extremely pessimistic, so the market atmosphere is gradually entering a tired phase, and the purchasing attitude of each factory is very cold, which is really disappointing. However, the vast majority of long-term new cotton has been absorbed by the Japanese merchant Dongmian Trading Company. Recently, the weather has been abnormal, with sudden rain and sunny days, and reports of excessive rainfall in various regions. New sellers are still absent, so the transactions in the market are quite clear, and there will be changes in the future.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Western Road had 20 to 30 shipments, and street sales were smooth. Due to the inverted production price between Changshu, Xichang, and Sukun’s thick japonica rice and the Shanghai market, combined with poor weather, although the source was small, the supply was limited. It is said that machine factories still have a small amount of accumulation. Village sales were very strong, and the situation looked promising. Transactions of thick japonica rice and early and late rice were extremely weak. The opening price dropped by 5 fen. Not much glutinous rice was loaded, and the trend was unchanged. Reed flat rice all felt dull. Dam flat rice lacked goods and had no market.</p>

<p>Yesterday, each gang's source was sparse, and the river accumulation was weak. City and rural store sales, although feeling average in the morning, the initial holding was guarded, but later, due to the failure to receive goods, transactions turned smooth. The price of thick japonica rice rose by half a chi, and the market still looked tight. The arrival of thin rice was sporadic, and the Ning taste was very thin. This street's sales were extremely weak, and the market looked high and fixed and then soft. The taste of reed ocean flat rice was limited, causing the price to loosen by one chi. Metain yuan followed as it came and was sold, with no increase or decrease in price. The arrival of ocean rice was lonely, and the transaction of local customers was still good, and the situation was tight.</p>

<p>Rumors Abound of a Certain Factory Releasing a Large Batch</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the flour market, after the opening of the market in the morning, the prices of each month were still stable, because the quotation of foreign wheat, although it continued to fall by 2-3 jiao, and the weather had turned clear, the situation of rising due to rain must still be tired. However, the mainland bulls always held firm and did not want to return, and the factory's sale of goods was also sporadic, so the opening price of each month was not much different from the previous day. Until the afternoon market opened, the situation of each month suddenly became depressed. The sharpness of the decline was similar to the rising wind of the previous day, because the price of foreign flour was only called 2 yuan 6 jiao, and it was rumored that a certain large factory would release a large batch, and general speculators seemed to strike first and make a major return, and the market gradually plunged sharply. Speaking frankly, according to the water situation in the mainland, looking at the bigger picture is still reasonable, but looking back on foreign countries, the quotation of foreign wheat has been low for 5-6 days in a row, and it is still not free from surplus, so it is difficult for people's hearts in the country to resist the comparison of foreign prices. As a result, this month fell by 2 fen from the previous day, August fell by 2 fen 2 li half, September fell by 2 fen, October fell by 1 fen 7 li half, November fell by 2 fen, and December fell by 1 fen half, it was said.</p>
<h3 id="e287">Futures Wheat Plunges by 7-8 Fen <a href="#e287" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c287" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">287</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the futures wheat market in the morning, the market of each month had already shown signs of fatigue, because the quotation of foreign wheat was again low by 2-3 jiao, and most people could not help but be suspicious because of this, but there were still few sellers and the degree of decline was also slight. Until the afternoon market opened, the near and far periods were again hit hard, because the foreign firms' foreign wheat price was only called 4 taels 3 qian 6 fen, and if they wanted to set a price, they would listen to the Chinese merchants' bids, which greatly stimulated people's hearts, and the selling sentiment suddenly increased, and the market plunged sharply, falling by 6, 7, or 8 fen. Looking at the future trend, with the open road of foreign wheat, simply picking up hard seems inappropriate. As a result, this month fell by 6 fen from the previous day, August, September, and October fell by 7 fen, November fell by 8 fen, and December fell by 4 fen. The current wheat market situation is still average, because the big factories have not moved, and the bottom is gradually thickening. In recent days, only small and medium-sized factories have had slight exchanges, opening 2600+ bags of Taicang, Taizhou, Benniu, Nanjing, Yangzhou, Xuzhou, Penglai, Shuangfeng, and Hezhou wheat, which were handled by Xiangxin and Xinda.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the foreign silk market in this port was even more desolate, because in the European and American markets, the daily silk cheap price competition sales were still strong, and Chinese silk prices were high, and telegrams did not turn, and the market atmosphere was bleak. Yesterday, only Public Security entered Shanghai white factory warp silk for 10 bags, Zhonghe, etc., entered white dry warp silk for 15 bags, and Gao Pei entered yellow coarse silk for 5 bags, and the price was still not vibrating.</p>
<h3 id="e289">Wuxi Summer Silkworms Damaged by Rainwater <a href="#e289" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c289" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">289</a></h3>
<p>In Wuxi's various markets and villages, this year's summer silkworm feeding was quite smooth, but the feeding was uneven, with both foreign and local breeds being bred. After receiving the ants, the weather was sunny and warm, and the development was smooth, but after the third sleep, there were continuous rainfalls, coupled with sultry heat and sudden cold. The early silkworms in the middle of the big sleep were found to have diseases such as diarrhea and black vomit due to eating rainwater leaves. The late silkworms with sufficient leaves in the third sleep were all lying stiff and unable to sleep, and most of them were stiffly dead. Mulberry leaves had a line but no market. The harvest of this year's Wuxi summer silkworms must still be poor, and the silkworm farmers were all frowning, and the loss of silkworm books was considerable.</p>

<p>Yesterday, in the foreign tea market in this port, the Wuyuan North Road Da Bang green tea was opened by Jinlong Foreign Firm at 58 taels, not much higher or lower than last year. The road village Zhenmei green tea, the upper and middle village goods of the past few days, have been sold, and the selling price is also firm. Items such as needle eyebrow and elegant eyebrow are also becoming more smoothly sold to France, but the market price is about 2-3 taels lower. Gongxi green tea, the Russian farm has not yet opened, and although Baitu village has a small number of good-quality goods, there has been no major progress.</p>

<p>The sale of yarn and wool Lanhutong is very smooth, and the market price is firm and rising. Since the tariff increase, orders have suddenly decreased, so it is expected that the import of new goods this year will fall sharply. Local customers are aware of this and rushed to collect old goods and old goods, which have all been sold. Goods that used to be sold for 6-7 qian a yard are now sold for 1-2 taels. For example, Ningfeng brand is sold for 1 tael 05 fen, and Lixing goods are 1 tael 4 qian.</p>

<p>According to a letter from Tianjin, the number of apricots coming out this year is still abundant. Now the new Jiudao eyebrow has already appeared, and the first Tianjin dish opened at 40 taels. Then Shanghai Bank handled 7 pieces, which were transported to Shanghai yesterday. It has not yet been seen. The cost, including foreign expenses, must be close to 50 taels.

<p>Typing is a skill necessary for businesses. However, without suitable textbooks, students have nowhere to turn. Typing instructor Xu Changqing, in view of this, based on his experience in the YMCA typing course, has compiled the book "Typing Speed Method." The content includes mechanical operation methods, nomenclature, fingering methods, and practice curriculum methods. It is very complete. If students purchase this book and follow the rules and regulations in the book, and practice for one hour each day, they will be able to type fifty words per minute with their eyes closed in one day. In order to promote this widely, each book is priced at only 60 cents. The book is sold at the Educational Department of the YMCA on Sichuan Road, the Dahua Magazine Company on Sichuan Road, the Commercial Press on Henan Road, and the Youth Association Bookstore at 20 Museum Road.</p>
<p>The Bailian Literary Society at 2 Yuanyuan Lane, Tientong'an Road, declares: Our society publishes a semi-monthly journal of youth literature. The content is entirely devoted to publishing outstanding youth works and discussing literary and artistic subjects. The inaugural issue has now been published. The consignment point is located at 126 South of the Grand French Avenue on the East Zilaihuo Street. Each copy sells for three copper coins.</p>
