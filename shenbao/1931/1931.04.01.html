<p>— 光美</p>
<p>事情—失竊雖屬是和饑食渴飲一樣的平凡但在任誰底生活史上决不會像那樣的易逢吧所謂平凡者不消說是指人類全部而非個别固然有一部份人因了生活和環境的緣故常時會請他嘗到滋味當然在他是無足爲奇的可是在試嘗第一遭者却又免不了有幾句閒話略加記載同時她又覺得失竊的原則雖一致而其環境和方式則又非一語可以包括了加之她們對於此次的失竊事自始至終都以爲是在做着幻夢若不借着今天這不凡的印象底機會隨便留下一些痕跡恐怕終於成功了一場不醒的幻夢哩</p>
<p>有情的棉被還在緊擁着她們各自圓着靑春少女底美夢雲雀也不敢高呌怕驚醒了她們太陽也早已體貼到這幾天没有課特地把她那極富金光的臉蛋兒深藏到雲霄裏爲的呵不忍一早就透進了窗紗直射到梳裝檯上再由鏡的反射直達她們那嬌態的面龐驚擾她們底睡眠呵同時都又不敢輕易地和她們吻合深恐她們夢中底情人暗中饗她以無音烟的手槍起身鐘地趁着她們尚在羅浮的時候偷偷地嚮過了房間裏空氣依然和夜深一般的靜穆</p>
<p>「不好了賊骨頭來過了小姐呀………」娘姨哭聲滴嗒地邊呌邊衝進她們房間掀起床毬查着他們的箱子是否被竊去可是聲音已顫抖得非嘗勵害神色已慌張到極點</p>
<p>這樣一來可空抛了棉被的有情雲雀的虚心和太陽的善於體貼了</p>
<p>「什麽什麽…」驚也似地睜開睡眼翹着那截短靑絲亂蓬鬆的頭聽到娘姨在房外哭應着「賊骨頭…」可嚇壞她們了</p>
<p>接着一瞧床面前的皮袍和門背上堆集成衣山般的大衣等都和他們宣告别離了</p>
<p>「是我們被…」還不待她們呌出娘姨又哭進來了「還有信件圖章在漏斗裏不知是那位小姐的…」</p>
<p>「是我的還有東西和錢呢」眉聽到圖章和信件知道是她的了連忙急呌着「是有用的東西呵…」聲音已帶哭顫了</p>
<p>「我也有錢呵鋼筆大約也在裏面哩……」</p>
<p>「我的衣服都没有了……」</p>
<p>寄和志也都同時哭呌出來了幼小的亞見此情狀跟着大哭娘姨恐懼的哭說着同學們關心和驚奇地垂訽着另一部份同學各自在檢點着自己的衣物有否被竊去還有一部分的人在吱吱喳喳地研究着失竊的眞象「賊從那裏進來的又從那裏出去的天還在落雪呵他怎麽知道單單到九號偷呢…………」一時議論紛紜哭聲擾嚷有小菜場上婦人們還價的瑣碎有火場中救火員救火的急切有被竊者的啼呼號陶嘈雜的空氣充滿了整個兒女生宿舍至時被一班男同學們戲稱爲「宮也者」頓時形成了虹口菜市</p>
<p>别的房間都未涉及只是九號裏發現大衣皮袍銀洋等物不翼而飛了計共四百餘元之譜而失主就是志寄眉三人呵</p>
<p>雖然是雨雪時作天公不做美可是在上海都不成問題他們預先相約趁着這不上課的期間内盡量地白相一下然也僅限於電影吧了還有早被人家請定了去吃廢歷的年夜飯美其名爲聚餐如今呢一切計劃均歸失敗</p>
<p>自從被竊後他們只好悶居房中没有衣服走不出去了</p>
<p>說也可怪明明門背面的四件大衣和其他衣服不翼而飛了衣架都已換了夏季而赤膊身上的皮衣一變而爲襯絨的還不時地要感着戰慄但好們始終不相信她們的衣服是眞的被人偷去了她們完全是好像做夢呵</p>
<p>她們沉悶煩惱雖算不得一件什麽可却有其他的原因在寄是本來就負着病將近一週就未曾進什麽飲食到此加上受凍便益形厲害了志的皮袍才做好的第六天便被竊去她原來預備回家過她祖母的八十壽的如今怎好回去呢她心急似劍她幻象着家人是多麽渴望着她回去祖母壽辰是幾何閙忙再看看現在所處的境遇呢不得不憤恨黯然楣因特種情形刻刻紀罣着她那慈祥的母親她們雖不同病但相憐</p>
<p>這還是第一遭的現象哩她們竟改了素來無憂的笑容吵閙的態度她們的活潑也隨在她們的愁容裏消失了那淸脆的歌喉再也找不出從她們的房間裏蕭和笛也可趁此難逢的機會大大地休息一番向來充滿了靑春朝陽般的她們的九號房間裏如今頓成灰色抑鬱的世界愁城病國生生地把她們葬進了</p>

<p>江灣一帶近年來將形成校區除開江灣那多所的學校不算外單江灣路上已有鼎足而立的法科持志與愛國最近每校都有失竊事發生且皆不僅一次此在地公安局久已弄得頭痛覺得治安上的不寗是維持者的責任或有旁怠該局當事者頗明大義於是引以爲咎和恥辱决意非將此案破獲不可藉以得知其他旣往的竊案正未可知而在學校方面也是如此男女宿舍的失竊委實是不下數次了</p>
<p>自從報告了公安局後該局的偵察隊曾三番五次地來察看失主的房間九號大概是考察賊子可以出進的途徑她們希奇覺怪一次一次地在她們的心目中無往而不存着個『奇』字甚至竟被新聞記者採去了由通信社發了一段消息無意中在各大報端發現了她們失竊的消息至於小報上上更不待言</p>
<p>好了她們的工作來了雖然是比較的麻煩些但都可從這麻煩中獲得了相當的安慰和消這在這期間中她們每天總得收到幾封本埠或外埠的慰問的信</p>

<h3 id="e2">Central Political Council Foreign Affairs Group Discusses Extraterritoriality Negotiations <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing: The Foreign Affairs Group of the Central Political Council convened a meeting at 6 PM on the 31st at the new site of the Central Political Council. Wang Chonghui, Sun Ke, Wang Zhengting, Kong Xiangxi, and special secretaries Li Jinlun and Xie Guansheng were present. Wang Chonghui chaired the meeting, and the Foreign Minister reported on the negotiations with relevant countries regarding extraterritoriality. The French response regarding extraterritoriality and other important cases concerning extraterritoriality were also presented for study. It is reported that decisions have been made. The meeting adjourned after 7 PM. Furthermore, regarding the extraterritoriality issue, all countries have generally expressed acceptance of the principle of returning extraterritoriality, but important points still need to be negotiated. The Foreign Affairs Group meeting on the 31st decided to continue adhering to the original purpose and that Foreign Minister Wang should respond to the opinions of various countries based on reason. (31st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing: The recent progress in the talks on extraterritoriality by the Foreign Affairs Group has been quite rapid. Although the British side previously proposed a plan for abolishing extraterritoriality in stages by district, it has shown a tendency to compromise due to our firm opposition and rejection. Therefore, the Chinese-British side is 80-90% towards a solution. Regarding the unresolved part, the British side has also made considerable concessions. However, the process of their concessions differs significantly from the original intention of our proposal. After consultations in recent days, a telegram has been sent to London for instructions. If the British government can further express concessions on this matter, a preliminary solution can be announced. The French side has also made considerable progress recently. It is untrue that France and Japan have adopted a coordinated approach. Since the Sino-Japanese treaty has expired, the proper way to resolve it is to conclude a new treaty of mutual benefit and equality. If the Japanese side is willing to express a friendly attitude and resolve the extraterritoriality issue first, it can only be considered as an unconditional consultation. Our side has sufficient reasons to negotiate separately with Japan, and it is permissible not to discuss it at all. The Brazilian side has a good attitude. According to a telegram from Envoy Wu, the American side has generally reached a solution. The remaining minor issues are being actively negotiated. All discussions with various countries are based on our country's final proposal on extraterritoriality as the basis for negotiations, and the answers proposed by various countries are merely expressions of their opinions for reference during discussions only. Furthermore, our country has made full preparations and is determined on this matter. Therefore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently made a serious statement to the envoys of relevant countries, expressing the hope that all friendly nations will resolve the matter with a sincere and friendly attitude within April; otherwise, other measures beyond the conference will be adopted. Currently, the attitudes of various countries have changed, and if one takes a broader view, a concrete solution can be obtained. (31st Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e24">The German-Austrian Customs Agreement and the League of Nations <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>The dispute caused by the German-Austrian Customs Agreement is indeed a major issue concerning the European situation and is worthy of study. On the part of Germany and Austria, it is believed that this agreement is purely an economic integration that does not concern politics, does not conflict with the interests of other countries, and is open to accession by third countries. It is still in line with Briand's proposal for a European Federation. Briand's opposition, on the other hand, argues that the agreement is sufficient to undermine external obligations and that the procedures used are outside the cooperative policies he previously proposed, so opposition must be expressed. The points of contention found in today's newspapers are only these. If the points of contention held by both sides are only in the interpretation of the articles, and only whether the procedures of the agreement are in compliance, then Germany and Austria have already declared that they are not afraid of legal research, and the governments of various countries have mostly ordered experts to conduct research. Once results are obtained, it will be clear whether the agreement is in conflict with the law and there will be no need for dispute. However, Europe's historical state is complex, with intricate economic and political interests. Each country has its suspicions and senses a fear of being infringed upon, mutually restraining each other in order to secure temporary peace. Once there is any action, the interests cannot be evenly distributed and the repercussions will not only be partial. Therefore, since the disclosure of the German-Austrian agreement, the voices of support and opposition have been mixed, which has its own complex relationship and even unmentionable issues. The British Foreign Secretary advocated requesting that the League of Nations include the issue on the agenda for discussion at the Council meeting on May 18. This is a powerful method for interpreting legal points and resolving disputes. However, if the disputed issues are not simple and the countries involved are unwilling to compromise, it is not easy to say whether the League of Nations meeting will yield good results.</p>

<p>Organizing a Financial Design Committee for Reorganization</p>
<p>Requesting the Executive Yuan to Approve the Issuance of Financial Public Bonds</p>
<p>Taiyuan: The wild fall in Jin banknotes is indeed being manipulated by unscrupulous merchants. The provincial government has decided that in addition to the seven predetermined relief measures, it plans to separately recruit business shares for the provincial bank, establish branches in various counties to be responsible for by the chambers of commerce, issue new banknotes to absorb the old banknotes, and organize a Financial Design Committee for Reorganization consisting of the Party headquarters, provincial government, military commanders, general headquarters, military supply departments, financial reorganization departments, chambers of commerce, money industry associations, education associations, agricultural associations, provincial banks, and financial experts to study measures. (31st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Taiyuan: Shang Zhen telegraphed the Executive Yuan on the 29th, stating that the Jin province's financial public bonds have not yet been officially restored, causing rumors to spread, and the price of provincial banknotes has plummeted, causing commodity prices to soar and affecting the lives of the people. Moreover, after the military reorganization, there is still no source for military funds, causing panic among the military and civilians and making it impossible to survive. He earnestly requested that the aforementioned public bonds be approved and issued as soon as possible to reassure the people. He also telegraphed Zhang, stating that the value of Jin banknotes has plummeted to less than 30%, and although the reasons are very complex, the main reason is that military funds have not been settled and provincial banknotes have no guarantee.

<h3 id="e72">British Attitude Towards German-Austrian Tax Agreement <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Strongly Advocates Submission to the League of Nations for Review</p>
<p>Germany Not Afraid to Study Legal Points</p>
<p>Austria-Hungary Conducting Similar Negotiations</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 30th: In the Lower House this afternoon, when questioned about the German-Austrian customs union, Foreign Secretary Henderson replied that the method adopted by Britain for the German-Austrian economic alliance was the only way to solve the problem of pan-European upheaval. The time and method chosen by Germany and Austria to release the news of this alliance were enough to arouse suspicion and extinguish the benefits of exchanging opinions provided by the League of Nations gathering in Geneva. He wanted to notify the Secretary-General of the League of Nations that he was willing to discuss at the next League of Nations Administrative Council meeting whether the German-Austrian agreement was in conflict with Austria's treaty obligations. The British government's attitude towards the legal issues arising from this agreement was not yet expressed. He initially thought that the German government misunderstood his original proposal, so he telegraphed Berlin again on March 28, and received a reply that day stating that the German government fully understood his proposal but still did not see any reason to submit this agreement to the League of Nations. He hoped that the German-Austrian negotiations would not proceed to the extent that would hinder the inherent friendly atmosphere when the League of Nations Administrative Council met in the future. The existence of the League of Nations mechanism has benefited member states in countless ways in cases where, without such a mechanism, ill feelings and harsh words could have arisen. As for the impact of the German-Austrian customs union on British trade, the government is currently studying it carefully. Former Conservative Foreign Secretary Chamberlain expressed his opinion that he agreed with the approach adopted by Henderson.</p>
<p>Reuters, Vienna, 30th: The Austrian Foreign Minister spoke today defending the German-Austrian customs agreement, saying that Austria had repeatedly negotiated with neighboring countries to reduce or remove tariff barriers, but to no avail, resulting in the German-Austrian agreement. Austria was conducting similar negotiations with Hungary and Czechoslovakia, while Germany was also negotiating with Romania, indicating that cooperation throughout Central Europe was a much-needed goal. Germany and Austria were merely fulfilling their responsibilities to their own countries and to Europe, and had no intention of disrupting European peace.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 31st: Foreign Minister Curtius said in the Federal Parliament today that Germany and Austria were forced by economic difficulties to take action to balance the tax rates between the two countries in order to improve and expand the industry and commerce of the two countries. It is incomprehensible that friendly countries cannot understand this plight and have risen up in opposition, pointing out that this move hinders Austria's independence and violates treaties and endangers peace. Although British Foreign Secretary Henderson wants to submit this matter to the League of Nations Administrative Council for discussion, Germany and Austria believe that studying this matter from a legal point of view is not necessary, but they have not objected to it.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 31st: French newspapers expressed dissatisfaction with British Foreign Secretary Henderson's speech in the British Lower House last night regarding the German-Austrian agreement and demanded direct action. For example, Le Matin stated that France might insist that Germany must guarantee the preservation of Austria's territorial status quo.</p>
<h3 id="e73">German Opposition Parties Petition to Withdraw Emergency Decree <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Government Issues Stern Reprimand</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 30th: Since the President announced the emergency decree, the opposition parties have petitioned the President to revoke the repressive order and dismiss his advisors. Today, the government issued an order to sternly reprimand the petition. The order first stated that the far-right's request for a mass vote to determine whether to dissolve the Prussian parliament was not prohibited, and refuted the statement that the government had no active construction in a year. The final section argued that the President had always been very receptive to the representatives of the right wing, and had carefully considered the content and impact of the order before signing it, so requesting to revoke the order was tantamount to directly attacking the President himself. Although members of the German National People's Party are now fabricating facts and spreading rumors to make the people of the country gradually doubt the President's impartiality and selflessness, such actions are regrettable and hateful.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Sino-Japanese Joint Transportation Conference <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Japanese United News Agency, Tokyo, 31st: On the third day of the 25th Sino-Japanese Joint Transportation Conference, the meeting was held at the Japanese Ministry of Railways at 10:00 AM yesterday. China proposed "The joint transportation business of the Xinmin Station on the Beining Line has no results and should be cancelled." The Chinese representative explained the content of the proposal, and the result was approved. Then, China proposed "The case of correcting the names of the lines, station names, and place names listed in the various contracts and measures." The necessary materials will be submitted by each participating organization. Next, the Railway Bureau of the Governor-General of Korea proposed "A new round-trip ticket scheme passing through Shenyang, Beiping, Tianjin, Dalian, etc." The Manchuria Railway proposed "Increasing the types of round-trip tickets sold at Changchun, Lushun, and Andong stations for both China and Japan." After discussion, China recognized the second question, "The case of selling tickets from Mukden to Fushun or from Hunhe to Fushun to passengers who have purchased round-trip tickets for both China and Japan" was also approved. The third question, "The case of starting the handling of group passengers between China and Japan" was discussed by both parties, and it was decided to calculate the fare in accordance with the regulations of the Chinese local area. The Japanese Ministry of Railways' "New round-trip ticket scheme between Shanghai and Japan" and "The establishment of Sendai, Hakodate, and Sapporo stations as stations for handling group tickets, and the establishment of a new station for handling group tickets on the Ping Sui Line of China" were also approved.</p>
<p>Japanese United News Agency, Tokyo, 31st: The fourth Sino-Japanese Joint Transportation Conference was held at 10:00 AM this morning to discuss the third question raised by the Japanese Ministry of Railways, changing the weight limit for small items in joint transportation to 50 kilograms. This is because many of the bekelide and artificial ivory exported from Japan and the porcelain and carpets exported from China exceed the current limit of 30 kilograms. As for the volume, it was also proposed to limit it to 300 cubic centimeters. Expanding the 50-kilogram piece was approved without objection. The volume piece was left to the committee. The case of correcting the calculation rules in the fourth question was too complicated and a simplification was proposed. The abolition of the report was approved. As for the abolition of the calculation book, it was retained until the next meeting for discussion at the request of the Chinese representative. Araki, the Director of the International Tourism Bureau, explained the nature of the International Tourism Bureau, the purpose and effect of attracting foreign tourists, etc., and stated that he was willing to handle this work jointly by China and Japan. The Chinese representative also understood this. All the questions in this meeting have been completed. The committee will meet on April 1st and 2nd, and the final meeting will be held and signed on the 6th.</p>

<p>A telegram from Nanchang to all newspapers and charities: We are writing to inform you that the people of Jiangxi have suffered from banditry for a long time, and the wounds are deep. Since ancient times, such suffering has been rare. Although the central government has repeatedly issued urgent relief and all parties have contributed funds and assistance in recent years, the disaster area is vast, and the vitality has been greatly damaged. The assistance is like a drop in the bucket, and the suffering is widespread. Now, the areas occupied by bandits have been gradually recovered, but the scars are everywhere, and the houses have been reduced to ruins. To settle the refugees, it is necessary to provide timely farming. The spring plowing season is now approaching, but the storage is empty. Unless a large amount of money is quickly raised to purchase seeds and farming cattle, it will be difficult to restore their livelihoods. We have always admired your compassion and love, and we hope that you will consider the orphans and the needy, and find a way to raise and advance 200,000 yuan in relief funds to quickly remit to Jiangxi for the purchase of agricultural tools and distribution to the refugees. We are eagerly awaiting your good news. If the great philanthropists form a disaster area inspection team to come to Jiangxi for inspection, we will be especially grateful. We hereby send a telegram to ask for your help. Ho Ying-chin.</p>

<h3 id="e77">The Aftermath in Shanxi Province is Increasingly Difficult to Handle <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Mutinies Also Occur in Jiang County and Lingchuan</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: In Shanxi Province, due to the lack of military expenses and the sharp drop in provincial banknotes, mutinies have been affected. The Changzhi riots have not yet been completely resolved, but Jiang County and Lingchuan have also been disturbed one after another. The stationed in Jiang County is a part of Zhang Zizhong's Brigade of Song Zheyuan's troops. The provincial government immediately telegraphed Song Zhe to investigate and deal with it as soon as possible. However, the mutinous soldiers are still in the city, and the cause of the mutiny has not yet been clarified. According to the report from the county to the province yesterday, the county magistrate was bound at the time. In addition to the release of prisoners, hundreds of merchants were looted, and they are still in a state of chaos. On the Lingchuan side, a part of the mutinous soldiers from Changzhi went to the county seat, monitored the county magistrate and the director of the Public Security Bureau, confiscated the guns of the police station, and extorted 100,000 yuan in cash and food. The division commander Zhou Sicheng is sending a team to suppress them. In addition, Yincheng Town, 70 miles away from Changzhi County, was invaded by mutinous soldiers on the 21st. They first extorted 5,000 yuan from the Chamber of Commerce. The mutinous soldiers then left Yincheng. Before leaving, the president of the Chamber of Commerce and the village chief all went to send them off. After leaving the town, the district chief and the president of the Chamber of Commerce turned back, but the village chief was forced to send them for another journey. Unexpectedly, when they reached Jianning Town, which belonged to Gaoping County, 20 miles away from Yincheng, they stopped and detained the village chief, sending a letter ordering the Yincheng Town to redeem them within three days with 200,000 yuan in cash. The town immediately agreed to 8,000 yuan and sent people to negotiate, but there was no result. On the night of the same day, the bandits returned to the town and looted, and no one was spared. According to the town, which is famous for its iron production and has a commercial prosperity that is no less than that of Lu'an City, the loss is estimated at more than one million. On the night of the 22nd, Division Commander Zhou of the Fourth Division ordered the First Battalion of the Eleventh Regiment and a company of mortar artillery to go to suppress them overnight, and it was heard that he had also agreed with the troops stationed in Gaoping to jointly suppress them, and it is expected that they will be pacified soon.

<h3 id="e78">Discovery of Ancient Tombs of the Liang and Song Dynasties in Nanxi, Sichuan <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Two Pottery Coffins with Intact Lids Found in Liang Tomb</p>
<p>Song Tomb Has a Monument Inscribed with "Established in the 16th Year of Qingli"</p>
<p>Chongqing Dispatch: In recent years, Chinese people have repeatedly discovered antiquities, which is of great significance for archaeologists and those who study ancient culture. Recently, ancient tombs of the Liang and Song dynasties were also discovered in Nanxi County, Sichuan, and among them were also Wu Zhu coins minted during the reign of Emperor Wu of Liang, which can be described as a major contribution to archaeology. The circumstances of the discovery are recorded below for the reference of archaeologists.</p>
<p>Luo Boxi of Nanxi County is skilled in calligraphy and painting and proficient in epigraphy. Wherever he goes, he personally visits ancient temples and tombs. Last year, when he returned to his hometown from Qian, he heard that ancient tombs had been discovered in two places near Daqiao, about three miles outside the east gate of Nanxi. The villagers did not know about it and immediately covered them up. So, on February 24th this spring, he invited Zeng Mengliang, the director of the education bureau, and Zeng Jiguang, Zhong Chaoxu, and others to investigate. He inquired with local scholars and indeed found two ancient tombs. The Liang tomb had a deep and wide tunnel, stretching about a mile. There were two pottery coffins inside, with many pottery figurines of civil and military officials, and many pottery utensils. Wu Zhu coins were scattered around the coffin. There was nothing in the coffin except for the skull. After Mr. Luo's identification, this was a tomb from the Six Dynasties, and it had been excavated several years ago, as the lids of the two coffins were moved to the ground and the pottery fragments were scattered in the tunnel, which could not have happened if it had not been excavated. The Wu Zhu coins were quite large, minted during the reign of Emperor Wu of Liang, not the Wu Zhu coins of the Han Dynasty, so it was determined to be an ancient tomb of the Liang Dynasty without a doubt. The Song tomb was also discovered in previous years by Chen Yutu, a doctor of Chinese medicine. Because the tunnel was deep and wide, he was afraid to enter. This time, Mr. Luo and Mr. Zeng entered with lanterns for about a mile and reached the tomb gate. On both sides of the gate stood figurines of civil and military officials, tall and sturdy, about five or six feet tall. After a few more steps, turning left, there was a sacrificial hall. There were six rows of figurines of civil and military officials on both sides of the hall. Behind the hall were more than ten stone steps. Ascending the steps, a large monument stood tall, about seven feet high, with the inscription "Tomb of Zhou Qi, Grand Master of Military Affairs of the Song Dynasty." Beside it was a line of small characters that read "Established in the 16th Year of Qingli." Behind the monument was the burial chamber, with a stone door that was tightly locked. Looking inside through the window, a vermilion coffin gleamed brightly. Fearing that there might be snakes, they did not dare to enter. Mr. Luo and others lingered in the sacrificial hall for a long time before leaving. After Mr. Luo discovered the two tombs, he discussed with Zeng Mengliang, the director of the education bureau, to move the two pottery coffins, pottery figurines of civil and military officials, Wu Zhu coins, etc., to the library of the education bureau for future museum display. As for the vermilion coffin, because the figurines of civil and military officials were tall and the burial chamber was eerie, it could not be moved by a few people. It was planned to excavate on a small scale, and the stone walls of the sacrificial hall were still engraved with epitaphs, but the inscriptions were covered by moss and the characters were indistinguishable. It will be examined further in the future. According to Mr. Luo, pottery coffins are not uncommon, but the pottery coffins discovered in Sichuan Province are most valuable in three cases: (1) When Yang Zihui was governor of Sichuan, six pottery coffins were discovered in Wulidun, Chengdu, and are now stored in the provincial library, but none of them have lids, which is quite strange. (2) In the past, an American named Gevie Han discovered a pottery coffin in Yaan Tianquan, which had a lid but was broken, and is now stored in the museum of the Yibin Youth Society. (3) The two pottery coffins discovered this time have intact lids and can be called perfect. The material of the pottery coffins this time is ancient brown, six or seven inches thick. When struck, they make a clanging sound, very similar to metal and stone. If used to make inkstones, their value is immeasurable and cannot be compared with other pottery coffins. They are truly rare objects.</p>

<h3 id="e79">Shi Yousan's Troops Transported to Heilongjiang Province <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>30,000 Surplus Troops Reorganized</p>
<p>Reorganized into the Heilongjiang Provincial National Defense Force</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: The reorganization of Shi Yousan's 13th Route Army and the issue of military pay were personally handled by Shi in Shenyang a month ago, consulting with Deputy Commander Zhang Xueliang at length. As Wan Fulin, the chairman of Heilongjiang Province, was in Liaoning, Deputy Commander Zhang invited Wan to discuss the matter jointly. The final decision was to reduce Shi's troops to three divisions, with the military pay to be borne by the central government and the Northeast at 200,000 each per month, and Heilongjiang to bear 100,000. The 30,000 surplus troops were to be transported to Heilongjiang and reorganized by Wan into the national defense force. Since the anti-Russian campaign, the national defense force has had many vacancies. For example, the three Class A brigades, the 2nd, 15th, and 17th, should have had more than 15,000 men each. After the war, after several recruitments and reorganizations, each brigade had only about 7,000 men. Heilongjiang Province has a sparse population, especially young men, so the recruitment has not been sufficient for a year. This time, the surplus troops from Shi's army are being reorganized, which is what the Heilongjiang authorities agreed to. Therefore, in mid-month, Wan summoned the commander of the 2nd Brigade, Su Bingwen, the commander of the 15th Brigade, Wang Yongsheng, and the commander of the 17th Brigade, Yu Zhaolin, to Shenyang, where Deputy Commander Zhang convened Wan Shi and the three brigade commanders to jointly discuss the number of troops to be reorganized into each brigade. After the decision was made, Wan returned to Heilongjiang on the 13th. At the same time, he sent four adjutants from the military command, Lin Shuchun and Zhang Baosen, with 50,000 yuan to Liaoning to transport the troops. On the 20th, a batch of these troops, totaling 760 soldiers and 50 officers, or 810 people in total, arrived in the provincial capital via the Tao'ang Railway. The rest will be transported successively, and are expected to arrive in Heilongjiang Province completely by late April. Currently, each of the 15th, 17th, and 2nd Brigades has a commissioner in the province waiting to lead the soldiers to their respective defense areas. It is heard that 4,000 men can be reorganized into the 15th Brigade, 6,000 into the 17th Brigade, and 7,000 into the 2nd Brigade. The rest will be reorganized separately into the 1st Brigade stationed in Heihe and the 2nd Cavalry Brigade stationed in Manzhouli Station. (25th)</p>
<h3 id="e80">Retrial Judgment of Gao Ying Case by the Jiangsu High Court <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>The case of Gao Ying, the former deputy consul in San Francisco, helping to traffic opium and dereliction of duty, was sent back for retrial by the Supreme Court. The Jiangsu High Court yesterday (30th) acquitted Gao Ying of the opium charges and sentenced him to one year and four months of imprisonment for dereliction of duty, with a fine of 1,400 yuan. Sun Yuan was sentenced to two years of imprisonment for the opium charges, with a fine of 2,000 yuan. The judgment has been delivered today (31st) at 5 pm and is recorded below:</p>
<p>Criminal Judgment of the Jiangsu High Court (Suit No. 1422 of the 19th Year) Appellant: Gao Ying, male, 36 years old, from Changle County, Fujian Province, former deputy consul of the Consulate General in San Francisco, USA, appointed defense lawyers Wang Youling and Liu Shifang. Appellant: Prosecutor of the Jiangning District Court Defendant: Sun Yuan, male, 41 years old, from Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province, former clerk of the Consulate General in the United States, appointed defense lawyers Li Zongqian and Lu Jianai. The above appellant Gao Ying and the defendant were charged with crimes such as opium and dereliction of duty. The Jiangning District Court issued the first-instance judgment on November 11, 18th year of the Republic of China. Gao Ying appealed the judgment, and the prosecutor of the original court filed an appeal against the part of the original judgment concerning the defendant. After the case was tried by this court, it was appealed again to the Supreme Court, which sent it back to this court for retrial. The judgment is as follows:</p>
<p>Main Text: The original judgment concerning Gao Ying and Sun Yuan is reversed. Gao Ying is sentenced to one year and four months of imprisonment for soliciting bribes for acts related to his duties, with a fine of 1,400 yuan. The number of days of detention before the judgment is determined shall be offset against the imprisonment at a rate of two days for one day of imprisonment. If the fine is commuted to imprisonment, it shall be calculated at a rate of three yuan per day, but the imprisonment period shall not exceed one year. He is acquitted of the opium charges. Sun Yuan is sentenced to two years of imprisonment for assisting in the sale of opium, with a fine of 2,000 yuan. The number of days of detention before the judgment is determined shall be offset against the imprisonment at a rate of two days for one day of imprisonment. If the fine is commuted to imprisonment, it shall be calculated at a rate of three yuan per day, but the imprisonment period shall not exceed one year.</p>
<p>Facts: Gao Ying was formerly the deputy consul of the Consulate General in San Francisco, USA. Sun Yuan was a clerk of the consulate. Sun Yuan had lived in San Francisco for a long time and was familiar with the overseas Chinese there. He also knew that, according to international practice, the luggage of consulate personnel and their families could be exempted from inspection upon entry. Therefore, in January of the 18th year of the Republic of China, when Gao Ying's wife, Gao Liao, returned to China from San Francisco, he asked a merchant named Shou Nanruoyun, whose surname was unknown, to ask Gao Liao to take advantage of this opportunity to transport a large amount of opium back to the United States for sale. At the same time, he asked Gao Liao to contact the Hong Kong smugglers Wen Yuxian and Shen Guang to purchase 2,299 cans of K-brand and Chang-brand opium paste, each can weighing about twelve taels and five qian. These were packed into eleven foreign boxes, with seals of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government and signatures of the Consulate General in San Francisco affixed to the boxes, which were marked as Gao Liao's own luggage, along with keys and letters addressed to Sun Yuan and Shou Nanruoyun. Gao Liao took the foreign boxes and three pieces of her own luggage on the Tianyang Maru, a ship of the Japanese Mail Steamship Company, on June 14th of the same year, departing for the United States. She first informed Gao Ying of the date of departure and the name of the ship by letter, and Gao Ying informed Sun Yuan. On July 5th, when the ship arrived at the port of San Francisco, they went together to meet her. However, they were detected by the U.S. Customs, which detained all fourteen pieces of luggage carried by Gao Liao. After Gao Ying and Sun Yuan negotiated unsuccessfully to avoid inspection, the Customs opened the boxes and inspected them on the 8th of the same month, and found opium and letters entrusting the transportation of opium. The U.S. court arrested Gao Liao, Gao Ying, and Sun Yuan and sent them to Minister Wu in the United States, who sent them back to China and handed them over to the Jiangning District Court Prosecutor for investigation. It was discovered that in April of the 17th year of the Republic of China, while Gao Ying was serving as the deputy consul of the Consulate General in San Francisco, he had accepted the request of Chen Yi to introduce four Chinese laborers, Mei Guang, Mei Geng, Wu Zhuo, and Lu Huan, to go to the United States and disembark in San Francisco, with an agreed-upon reward of US$3,200, which was later changed to $2,600. On June 8th of the same year, Mei Guang and others arrived at the port on the Siberia Maru. Gao Ying boarded the ship to receive them and discovered that their passports had been altered and that the name of the abolished Mexican Consulate had been abused. He sent Mei Guang and others back to China. In addition to Chen Yi's separate defense, Gao Ying was prosecuted for assisting in the sale of opium and soliciting bribes, and Sun Yuan and Gao Liao were prosecuted for assisting in the sale of opium. After the Jiangning District Court tried the case, Gao Ying and Gao Liao were not satisfied, and the original prosecutor was also not satisfied with the part of the judgment concerning Sun Yuan, and appealed. After the case was tried by this court, it was appealed again to the Supreme Court, which sent the part concerning Gao Ying and Sun Yuan back for retrial. The reasons for the court's decision are explained in two parts below: (1) Regarding the opium part, Gao Ying in this case is the husband of Gao Liao. Although the opium boxes carried by Gao Liao were affixed with seals of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and signatures of the Consulate General in San Francisco, it has not been proven whether the signatures were from the Consulate General in San Francisco and issued by Gao Ying's hand, as the signatures were not affixed with seals. Moreover, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not issued seals to foreign embassies and consulates for advance storage, as has been verified by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Gao Ying, who was far away in the United States, cannot be held responsible for the seals of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs affixed by Gao Liao in China. The original judgment that the consulate seals were given to Gao Liao by Gao Ying in advance is highly speculative. After the U.S. Customs detained Gao Liao's boxes, Gao Ying went to the Customs to negotiate and repeatedly telegraphed Minister Wu to request exemption from inspection and release, which clearly showed that he was shielding her. However, since the appellant and Gao Liao are husband and wife, and it cannot be proven that the appellant had a common intention in advance, it is difficult to consider his subsequent efforts to remedy the situation as an act of assistance. Moreover, the repeated telegrams all stated that they were for the sake of preserving the national honor, so there is no crime. The original judgment that the appellant Gao Ying assisted Gao Liao in transporting opium, which constituted a violation of Article 15 and Article 6 of the Opium Prohibition Law, and was punished according to Article 271, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, is flawed in both fact and law. The appellant's appeal regarding the opium part should be deemed reasonable. Furthermore, Sun Yuan, the defendant in this case, has lived in San Francisco for many years and is familiar with many overseas Chinese there. The letters from Wen Yuxian and Shen Guang to Sun Yuan carried by Gao Liao state: "I am now handing over the foreign boxes that the visitor is carrying, from No. 1 to No. 9, a total of nine boxes, to Brother Ruoyun for receipt, and two foreign boxes to Brother Shounan for receipt. Please send the foreign boxes to Brother Ruoyun and Brother Shounan for receipt as soon as they arrive (should be a typo for 'port'). Please telegraph the safety of each foreign box after they have been delivered." Wen Yuxian also sent Sun Yuan a separate letter stating: "Please personally open the foreign boxes and check that boxes No. 2 and No. 11 are delivered to Brother Shounan for receipt. Please deliver the remaining boxes to Brother Fu." It can be concluded that the defendant Sun Yuan has a close friendship with the Hong Kong opium traffickers Wen Yuxian and Shen Guang, and the San Francisco opium trafficker Shou Nanruoyun. Moreover, the 2,299 cans of K-brand and Chang-brand opium paste each weigh about twelve taels and five qian. According to the letters from Wen Yuxian and Shen Guang to Shounan, the cost of the K-brand is 70 yuan. If, as the defendant claims, he does not know Wen Yuxian, Shen Guang, or Shou Nanruoyun, how could he dare to entrust them to transfer opium worth millions of yuan? Moreover, since Wen Yuxian and Shen Guang entrusted Gao Liao to carry the opium, if there were no prior arrangements with the defendant Sun Yuan, Gao Liao could have directly handed it over to Shou Nanruoyun. Why would it be necessary to entrust the defendant to transfer it? The words "Telegraph the safety of each foreign box after they have been delivered" in the original letter clearly show that Gao Liao has no close relationship with Wen Yuxian and others. Her carrying of opium on behalf of Wen Yuxian and others, and the sending of opium to Shou Nanruoyun by Wen Yuxian and others, were all coordinated by the defendant. His assistance in the sale of opium is even more obvious. Although the defendant went to the ship to take care of the opium after it was transported, he was detained by the Customs and did not hand it over to Shou Nanruoyun. However, since there is sufficient evidence that he contacted Wen Yuxian and others in advance to traffic opium, he should also be held responsible for assisting in the sale of opium. The original trial did not study the details of the crime carefully and hastily acquitted the defendant, stating that the letters from Wen Yuxian and others carried by Gao Liao were merely one-sided requests and could not prove that Sun Yuan had any criminal intent. The prosecutor's appeal regarding this part is not unreasonable. (2) Regarding the dereliction of duty part, a letter from Chen Yi to the appellant Gao Ying stated: "I now have three or four people who want to go to the United States. Can I obtain diplomatic passports on their behalf? Can you receive them? If so, I will reward 1,000 yuan per person, and I will only take back a quarter." Another letter from Chen Yi to the appellant Gao Ying stated: "I received a telegram in the east stating that they have already boarded the ship and had to leave to pick up a letter in Shanghai stating that the Mexican identity could not be used. Fortunately, only one person used it. I don't know what the result will be. The amount could have been 3,000, but it was changed to 2,400. I have asked them to increase it to 2,600." This shows that Chen Yi requested Gao Ying to receive and introduce the four Chinese laborers Mei Guang, Mei Geng, Wu Zhuo, and Lu Huan to disembark in the United States. The appellant Gao Ying not only did not refuse, but also said that the Mexican identity could not be used, and instructed them on how to go to the United States. When the Chinese laborers arrived in the United States, the appellant Gao Ying falsely claimed that two of them were his private servants and asked Consul Gong to provide assistance. Moreover, the appellant admitted this clearly, and Sun Yuan also stated how he profited from it in detail. It can be seen that the evidence that the appellant and Chen Yi agreed on a reward to receive and introduce Chinese laborers to disembark is conclusive and leaves no room for argument. The Supreme Court has already made a clear judgment in its decision. The issue that should be investigated further now is whether the appellant's introduction of Chinese laborers to disembark is within the scope of his consular duties. Although Article 1 of the Regulations on Consular Officials states that the duties of consuls, consuls general, and vice consuls stationed abroad in the jurisdictional area are to develop the country's commerce and comfort overseas Chinese merchants, the consular duties stated in Articles 8 and 9 are not limited to commercial matters. Moreover, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated in a public letter to the original trial that "Consular duties are to protect overseas Chinese. Therefore, although there are no explicit regulations on receiving and introducing them at the port, it is something that should be done if it is actually necessary." It is difficult to say that receiving and introducing Chinese laborers to disembark is not a consular duty. Moreover, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied to this court that "Consular duties are originally to protect overseas Chinese. The United States has always restricted the entry of Chinese laborers. If the consul in charge determines that the situation requires it and sends personnel to the port to receive and introduce them, it is a duty that should be performed, and there is no need to issue any special orders." It can be seen that the appellant's introduction of Mei Guang and the other four people met the actual needs. The original trial found that the appellant Gao Ying's solicitation of bribes was not inappropriate, but his actions in office could not be said to be a violation of his duties. The original judgment's citation of Article 129, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, and its application of the law, were flawed. Although the appellant's argument denying the facts of soliciting bribes is untenable, his attack on the inappropriateness of the original judgment cannot be said to be completely unreasonable.</p>
<p>In summary, in accordance with Article 385, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the original judgment concerning Gao Ying and Sun Yuan is reversed and a new judgment is issued. Gao Ying is sentenced to one year and four months of imprisonment and fined 1,400 yuan for the crime of soliciting bribes for acts related to his duties, in accordance with the first part of Article 2, Article 128, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, Article 3 of the Criminal Law Enforcement Regulations, Decree No. 160 of the National Government, Article 1, Paragraph 1 of the Regulations on the Crime of Betraying the Oath of Party Members, Article 5 of the Special Criminal Law and Other Criminal Sentencing Standards Regulations, with a one-third increase in the original sentence. He is acquitted of the other opium charges in accordance with Article 316 of the Criminal Procedure Law. Sun Yuan is sentenced to two years of imprisonment and fined 2,000 yuan for the crime of assisting in the sale of opium, in accordance with Article 2, Article 6, Article 15 of the Opium Prohibition Law, and Article 9, Article 44, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. The number of days of detention before the determination of the judgment shall be offset in accordance with Article 64 of the Criminal Law. If the fine is not paid after compulsory execution, imprisonment shall be commuted in accordance with Paragraphs 3 and 4 of Article 55 of the Criminal Law. The judgment is hereby issued as in the main text.</p>

<p>Request to Postpone the Conversion of Land Tax to Silver Denied: Yesterday, the County Finance Bureau received instructions from the Provincial Department of Finance stating that Hu Wei and others, fellow villagers of Songjiang in Beijing, had reported that the conversion of land tax to silver in Songjiang County had exceeded 1% of the land price and requested a temporary postponement of the increase in tax to alleviate the suffering of the people. In response to this, the Provincial Department of Finance instructed that after the Provincial Department of Finance commissioned a field investigation and reply on the increase in tax in Jinshan and Baoshan counties, it has already ordered that the case be handled in accordance with the plan and that there is no postponement. In addition, the other matters presented are not consistent with the facts and should not be considered. Shen, the director of the County Finance Bureau, posted a notice after receiving the order, informing Hu Wei and the businesses to comply.</p>

<p>Su Wenxiang Has Escaped from the Bandit's Lair: Su Wenxiang, a villager from Qingcungang South Salt Lane in the Fifth District, who was kidnapped, has reportedly escaped from the bandit's lair after two months. However, the circumstances of his escape are strange, and many people are suspicious. According to the reporter's investigation, Su's family claimed that a few days before Wenxiang's escape (the night of March 14), twelve accomplices of the bandits came to their house and demanded a ransom of 10,000 yuan, otherwise they would tear up the ticket. They also forced Su's wife to negotiate the price herself. Unable to do otherwise, she was accompanied by a brave neighbor to the bandit ship (anchored in the sea about 30 miles away from Qianjia Bridge and Qin Gongtang). She saw Wenxiang tied up in the hold, suffering greatly. Just as she was about to negotiate, she saw three large ships sailing towards the sea, and the bandits suddenly panicked and waved her away. Not far from the ship, she heard rapid gunfire. However, whether it was a suppression operation by government troops could not be ascertained because she was anxious to escape. It was not until the afternoon of the 25th of this month that two patrol officers sent by the Zhejiang Water Police came to the town to report the news of the escape, and it was learned that it was the suppression operation of the 9th Patrol Team of the 2nd District of the Zhejiang Offshore Water Police. Su's family went to the newspaper yesterday and asked the county government to send police to accompany them to Jiashan, Zhejiang Police Team to identify him.</p>

<p>Another Robbery Case in Xiaojian Township: At about 11 pm on the 28th, eight or nine robbers suddenly came to the home of Lu Qingqing, a farmer near Nandu Bridge in Xiaojian Township, Hongdou District. Speaking with a Hakka accent and carrying sharp weapons, they broke down the door. When Lu woke up from his sleep and tried to resist the robbers, he was immediately grabbed and forced to reveal the location of his hidden silver, and was beaten severely. After Lu begged, he was spared from harm. The robbers then sent two people to guard Lu and others, and the rest went inside to rob. They robbed for about an hour before leaving. After the incident, it was checked and it was found that more than a hundred silver dollars and several sets of clothes had been stolen. The Fisheries Representatives of Eight Counties Hold a Meeting in the Province: Hupukou in this county has a dense collection of fish markets. During the spring fishing season, thousands of fishing boats gather at this port for sales. The value of the fishing market in one season is about a million yuan. In recent years, due to the rampant sea bandits and frequent robberies on the Yangtze River, fishing boats dare not go fishing, so the Hupu fish market has been declining day by day. At the current spring fishing season, fisheries organizations have sent representatives to the provincial meeting to discuss remedies. Representatives from Tongzhou, Haizhou, Ganlu, Fuyang, Yancheng, Dongtai, Rugao, Changshu and other eight counties signed in. Ren Fei'an, a representative from this county, attended. The representatives proposed four key points, which are recorded as follows: (1) Salt Smuggling Problem: Regarding the fishery salt law and the method of changing the color and taste of salt, it has been announced on January 7 this year, so there should be no more private seizure and extortion. Small fishing boats can purchase salt in bulk at the salt fields, or purchase it separately from the local district office, fishery association, or fishery cooperative in accordance with the method of changing the color and taste. (2) Banditry Problem: Regarding banditry, two solutions were decided: a fundamental solution and a stopgap solution. A. The stopgap solution is to suppress the bandits before the small yellow croaker fishing season and enable the boats to go to sea for fishing with peace of mind. B. The fundamental solution is for the conference to appoint seven representatives from the Naval Department, the Coastal Patrol Office, the Security Office, the Jiangzhe Fisheries Affairs Bureau, the Civil Affairs Department, the Agricultural and Mining Department, and the Pacification Commissioner's Office to form a Maritime Defense Committee to organize a maritime security team. (3) Donation and Tax Problem: The issue of fisheries donations and taxes was not discussed at the meeting. Only Ren Fei'an, the representative from Changshu, submitted a written request to the provincial department to forward it to the central government for the implementation of fishery protection tax. It is now heard that the central government has submitted this case to the State Council for approval to exempt fisheries tax for discussion. (4) Problem of Encroachment on Fishing Grounds: Regarding foreigners arbitrarily occupying fisheries in the national territory, please request the central government to ask the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to separately resist. Regarding the Ministry of Finance, if Japanese fishing vessels do not have an export certificate from that country when importing, order the customs to prevent their import. Regarding the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, negotiate with the Japanese ambassador to prevent them from using the country as a fishing base within the national territory.</p>
<p>Great Fire in Xushi Town: Gu, a resident of Xushi Town in this county, runs a small cloth factory in the town, which is quite prosperous.

<p>A Doctor Causes an Accident While Giving an Injection: In Yangming Township, under the jurisdiction of the county, near Xiadian Bridge, in Zhang Alley, a farmer named Zhang A’bao’s son, A’gou, twelve years old, suddenly contracted acute meningitis the day before yesterday. They immediately invited Chen Zushou, a Western-style doctor from the Furen Hospital near Dagong Bridge outside the South Gate, to come to the village for treatment. Chen attempted a spinal tap, but somehow the needle suddenly broke off inside the skin. The doctor, realizing the trouble he had caused, immediately sent someone to carry A’gou to Puren Hospital to have the needle removed. Dr. Li Kele performed the surgery and extracted the broken needle. Unexpectedly, after the needle was removed, A’gou deteriorated and died yesterday morning. Zhang A’bao, deeply grieved by his son’s tragic death, had serious negotiations with Dr. Chen and carried A’gou’s body to the hospital, placing it in the doctor’s office. Later, others intervened and mediated, proposing to collect several tens of dollars to give to the family of the deceased for a coffin. It is not yet known whether the family of the deceased will agree.</p>
<p>Another Robbery and Assault Case in Nanyanshi: In the 11th District (Nanyanshi), in Di Ze Township, in Henghe Tou Village, a resident named Hua Yaozu, who made a living as a fortune teller, had accumulated some savings, which attracted the attention of bandits. The day before yesterday, around 1 a.m., a boat suddenly arrived with seven or eight bandits on board. Their faces were painted with colors, and they were armed with dangerous weapons. They swarmed ashore, broke open the Hua family's front door, and entered the house to rob them. Yaozu resisted the robbery and was struck in the head by the bandits. Fortunately, his injuries were minor and not life-threatening. Hua’s second daughter was also tied up with rope by the bandits. The bandits then went from room to room, overturning chests and cabinets, and looting extensively. After about half an hour, they left with their stolen goods, boarding the original boat and speeding away. Afterwards, an inventory revealed that gold and silver jewelry, clothing, and other items worth over 200 dollars had been stolen.</p>
<p>An Escaped Bandit from Jiangyin Arrested in Wuxi: Xiao Linshu from Shasha, Jiangyin, previously served as a leader of the Red Bandits and repeatedly participated in riots in various townships in Jiangyin.

<p>Major Fire Along Miao Yan River: There was a fire at the Gao Family Courtyard along Miao Yan River in Wuyi City, with a total of five or six connected houses, totaling several dozen rooms. The owner was Dr. Gao Qin Xun, and there were also six or seven tenant families living there, including the Li, Wang, and Lu families. Around 11 p.m. on the 30th, the firewood room in the back suddenly caught fire. In an instant, the fire blazed into the sky and the flames were fierce. The fire brigades from various districts rushed to the scene to put out the fire, but because the fire had already spread extensively, it took two hours to extinguish. After the investigation, it was found that a total of eighteen rooms, both upstairs and downstairs, had been burned, resulting in significant losses.</p>
<p>Workers Engage in a Brawl Outside the North Gate: Outside the North Gate of Wuyi City, around 5 p.m. on the 29th, Wang Dalong led a group of ruffians and hooligans resembling workers, numbering over a hundred, all wielding iron bars and shouting loudly. At that time, many railway workers happened to arrive, and a conflict erupted after a heated exchange. Wang Minwei, the patrol officer from the local Public Security Substation, immediately telegraphed the garrisoned soldiers and the wooden-helmeted team from the Public Security Bureau to rush to the scene to stop the brawl. Three perpetrators, Hu Lao San, Tu Shousheng, and Wu Jinsheng, were apprehended on the spot, and the fighting ceased. After being interrogated by the Public Security Bureau, the perpetrators were transferred to the county government on the 30th for further investigation.</p>

<p>Jiangsu Provincial Government Streamlines Land Taxes: The provincial government considers land taxes to be the largest source of revenue for the province.</p>
<p>However, there are many longstanding problems in various counties. Some landowners fail to pay taxes on their land, while others fail to report cultivated land for tax assessment. Streamlining these issues would pose many difficulties. First, there are no accurate statistics on the area of arable land in each county. Second, in the counties north of the Yangtze River, powerful landlords control the land and resist paying taxes. If the government were to strictly enforce the regulations, these landlords could incite tenants to cause disturbances and obstruct the process. Therefore, the current plan is to divide the entire province into several districts and begin streamlining the process in a few counties where the situation is relatively simple. The Land Bureau will work with the Finance Bureau to conduct a clear measurement of the land, using triangulation to determine the approximate area of the land. This will then be carefully reconciled with the actual amount of grain collected to identify discrepancies and gradually streamline the process.</p>
<p>Former Pixian Magistrate Sent to the Provincial Capital for Interrogation: According to a report from Wang Xipeng and other citizens of Pixian, the former magistrate of the county, Wang Lantian, was arrested in Jiangsu for owing public funds and failing to provide a clear accounting of his handover. They requested that the provincial government send someone to escort him to the provincial capital for interrogation. The Jiangsu Provincial Government immediately instructed Zou, the director of the Wuxian Public Security Bureau, to ensure that Wang was safely escorted to the provincial capital for interrogation. Director Zou, upon receiving the order, appointed Detective Team Leader Zhou Hongjiang to escort Wang to the provincial capital. The Finance Department sent a letter to the Zhenjiang County Government requesting that they detain Wang and ordering Magistrate Zhang to strictly pursue the recovery of the owed public funds.</p>

While many schools have diligently followed the laws and regulations and made determined progress, a significant number have failed to comply or have not reported their implementation, even if they have implemented it. Currently, the Ministry is determined to ensure effective implementation. Therefore, we request that your ministry instruct the educational authorities in each province to investigate and report the following information for all public high schools and higher institutions under their jurisdiction, as well as private high schools and higher institutions that have been approved for establishment, regardless of whether they have implemented military training: the name of the school, its location, and the number of students, grades, and classes. Please compile and submit this information to the Ministry before the summer vacation so that we can take action." The Ministry has reviewed the matter and found that information on the names, locations, number of students, grades, and classes of public and private high schools and higher institutions in various provinces and cities has been reported to the Ministry and forwarded to the Training Directorate General for review. However, this information may be outdated due to the passage of time and may need to be updated. Therefore, in accordance with the consultation from the Training Directorate General, we urgently order that your department promptly compile a report in accordance with the attached format for all public and private high schools and higher institutions under your jurisdiction that have been approved for establishment and submit it to the Ministry by May 31 of this year for review and forwarding.

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau issued Instruction No. 252 to all middle and primary schools in the city (without separate documentation): "Instruction No. 471 from the Ministry of Education states that our country's middle and primary school education has not emphasized labor and production activities, resulting in graduates who are unable to engage in manual labor and have no vocational production skills. At a time when production is declining and people's livelihoods are in distress, school education must adapt to social needs to remedy the situation and avoid cultivating youth with excessive desires and a focus on personal gain, who lack the skills to earn a living after graduation. This is not only unhelpful to society but also exacerbates social unrest. These past educational shortcomings must be corrected. The education objectives of the Republic of China include 'enriching people's lives, supporting social survival and development, and developing national livelihoods,' and the implementation guidelines clearly state that 'general education must be based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings... and aim to cultivate citizens' livelihoods and improve national production capacity.' This is intended to correct past imbalances. All educational institutions must strictly adhere to these principles and not neglect them. In order to implement these education objectives and remedy educational shortcomings, the specific measures to be taken are listed below: (1) All public and private primary schools must strictly implement the work subjects as stipulated in the Ministry's Temporary Standards for the Primary School Curriculum. (2) All public and private junior middle schools must strictly implement the various subjects of agriculture, industry, and home economics as stipulated in the Ministry's Temporary Standards for the Junior Middle School Curriculum, taking local conditions into consideration. (3) All students in public and private middle and primary schools must participate in labor activities within the school. Special emphasis should be placed on production activities in various subjects. (4) Provincial, municipal, and county inspectors should pay special attention to the performance in agriculture, industry, home economics, and other subjects during inspections. (5) The Bureau should promote and advocate for labor and production education in various ways so that society and families fully understand the current trends in our country. All of the above points should be followed by the schools under your jurisdiction. If equipment is insufficient or teachers are lacking, funding should be increased and content enriched within a limited time, and teachers should be trained in various ways within the scope of your Bureau's responsibilities to achieve practical results. A report on the implementation should be submitted for verification. This is the order."</p>

The two aviators' round-trip flight between Paris and Tokyo was relatively smooth, except for being hindered by heavy fog in the Hong Kong area and being detained by the Japanese authorities in Seoul for a few days for flying over the Japanese military defense zone. If the weather in the south turns better this morning, they will first go to Hong Kong and then all the way back to France via Saigon and Hanoi. It is also heard that the purpose of the two aviators' flight this time is to open up a future air route from Paris to Tokyo.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Jianghai Customs Takes Over Foreign Warship River Moorings <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Effective Today</p>
<p>Jianghai Customs issued a notice stating that the river moorings in Huangpu Port for warships from the United Kingdom, the United States, Japan, France, and Italy are causing obstructions to passing ships. Therefore, it has requested the navies of various countries to hand over the available river moorings to Jianghai Customs for unified management of the river surface. This will prevent collisions and accidents caused by merchant ships entering and exiting the Huangpu River. This matter was announced earlier and scheduled to begin on April 1st, with the Customs Commissioner taking over. Investigation revealed that river moorings No. 1 to No. 5 were for warships of various countries to moor, river mooring No. 6 was for China Merchants Bureau ships to moor, and river mooring No. 7 was for public ships to moor. Nos. 1 to 5 were all designated for foreign merchant ships, so foreign warships could moor freely. Nos. 8, 9, and 10 were for Japan Mail Company and Osaka Shosen, etc. Japanese warships coming to Shanghai all moored at river moorings Nos. 8, 9, and 10. Starting today, Customs plans to first take over river moorings Nos. 8, 9, and 10. Prior to this, the Japanese merchants were notified and negotiated. It is said that Japan Mail Osaka and other companies, although holding objections to this matter, had no choice but to prepare for the return due to the limitation of the situation, but they had to recover the price of the chains and other costs of setting up the river moorings from Customs. Negotiations are currently underway, and river moorings Nos. 1 to 5 must also be taken over and managed one by one in the shortest possible time.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Japanese Ships Disappear from Haizhou <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The First Voice of Regaining Navigation Rights</p>
<p>Since the opening of Haizhou Port, Japanese ships initially dominated the shipping routes in the area. The route between Qingdao and Haizhou was almost exclusively operated by Japanese shipping merchants. Chinese ships only began operating after 1923, but under the pressure of Japanese ships, Chinese shipping merchants had no room for expansion. Japanese ships also often collided with Chinese ships. Until last year, after the central government negotiated with the Japanese side for a year, Japanese ships finally disappeared from Haizhou on February 21st this year. Our country regained its navigation rights, with Haizhou being the first voice of realization. The entire process and the current development of Chinese ships are recorded below.</p>
<p>Negotiations on Japanese Ships Stopping Navigation For nearly ten years, Japanese ships have been sailing between Haizhou, Qingdao, and Shanghai. Initially, few Chinese ships operated, resulting in Japanese ships dominating the Qinghai and Shanghai routes. Since the Japanese warships arbitrarily entered Haizhou the year before last, and because Japanese ships were hijacked by bandits, the Japanese navy arbitrarily landed, shot and killed Chinese people, and burned civilian houses, the central government began to protest and prohibit Japanese ships from entering the Haizhou inland area. Later, there was another incident of a Japanese ship sinking a Chinese ship. The central government negotiated again and sent warships to the Qinghai border to monitor Japanese ships, not allowing them to enter the inland area arbitrarily, otherwise they would be detained. To this end, Japanese ships changed their methods, specially preparing the blue sky and white sun flag inside the ship. When arriving at the outer port of Haizhou, they changed to hanging our national flag, posing as Chinese ships to mix into Haizhou. It was not until late February this year that customs were set up to prohibit them.</p>
<p>Haizhou Adds Branch Customs In the past, import and export taxes in Haizhou were collected by the Qingdong Tax Bureau. Japanese ships often evaded taxes. In February of this year, the Ministry of Finance decided to add Jianghai Branch Customs in Haizhou to specialize in collecting import and export taxes. Customs also sent patrol ships to patrol the outer sea of Haizhou to prevent tax evasion. Japanese ships that falsely hung our flag and secretly arrived in Haizhou to steal navigation were discovered by the branch customs several times and the ships were detained. Since February 21st, Japanese ships that falsely mixed in under false flags have not come to Haizhou.</p>
<p>Chinese Ships Are Developing More and More At present, the number of Chinese ships operating on the routes between Qingdao, Haizhou, and Shanghai, which were previously prohibited for Japanese ships, is increasing day by day. Initially, only Tongde, Hezheng, Yuelai, and other companies dispatched one or two ships. Now, China Merchants has also dispatched Tonghua, Yudada, and Northern companies, all of which have ships sailing to Haizhou. Last year, Dazhen Shipping Company was established, and there were formal scheduled liners dedicated to sailing between Shanghai and Haizhou. Huge docks were built in Dapu, and railways were built to directly connect to the Longhai Railway Station to facilitate freight transportation. After the end of the Northwest War, freight from Haizhou directly reached the three provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, and Henan, and the volume of goods traveling back and forth increased day by day. Dazhen's Dayong and Ping'an ships are no longer sufficient. The company has decided to increase new shares by 500,000 to purchase two new ships to join this route, one named Jiyang and one named Ping'an. The plan is to expand the Shanghai-Haizhou route to 20 times per month, which is in progress.</p>
<p>Alliance of Three Shipping Companies Dazhen, Hezheng, and Chengxin shipping companies have agreed on a business alliance. Starting today, the export water freight from Shanghai to Haizhou will be increased by 20%, and the import water freight from Haizhou will be increased by 10%. The alliance treaty has been signed, and private price cuts are not allowed. If found, the first violation will be fined five times the collected water freight, the second violation will be fined ten times, and the third violation will be fined one hundred times. The fines will be used for charitable purposes.</p>
<p>Hidden Reefs Discovered on the Route In the middle of Haizhou, Shanghai, and Qingdao, near Wudaosha, at 122 degrees 12 minutes east longitude and 33 degrees 15 minutes north latitude, a new reef with a large area was suddenly discovered. It is very dangerous for ships traveling on the Qinghai and Shanghai routes. Customs has sent technicians to survey and map it, and notify each shipping company and list it on the new map. In addition, the body of the British ship Yingfa, which sank in August last year at the Linhong Port outside Haizhou, is gradually entering the waterway and obstructing navigation. The Longhai Railway Bureau plans to send personnel to blow it up to facilitate navigation.</p>

<p>Water Supply and Sale Industries Separately Exempted from Tax</p>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating: "In the case approved by Beiping Municipal Government No. 68, the Finance Bureau stated in its presentation that there are still doubts about the tax scope of banks and special companies, streetcars, electric lights, and tap water as stipulated in the General Outline and Supplementary Measures for the Collection of Business Tax. Please explain separately. The Ministry, in addition to investigating the General Outline for the Collection of Business Tax, stipulates in Article 1 that companies that have already paid income tax to the central government and those that have already been levied special taxes by the central government are excluded. The phrase 'refers to those who have already paid income tax or special taxes to the central government.' The Ministry has already established five explanation measures for circulation. Also, the banks and special companies mentioned in Article 1 of the Supplementary Measures should be taxed separately by the central government and are not within the scope of business tax in various provinces and cities. As for streetcars, electric lights, and tap water, each is a state-run enterprise and of course is not subject to business tax. If it is a private enterprise, streetcars and electric lights belong to the electrical industry, and the business tax rate shall not exceed 2/1000 of the business income. Water is the most needed and most easily consumed small commodity among daily necessities. Tap water industry, water sales industry, etc., are removed and exempted from tax." In addition to replying to the municipal government and instructing the Finance Bureau to be informed, it is hereby notified to you, Ministry of Finance, Jian Yin.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Paint Industry Requests Reduction of Business Tax <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Paint Industry Association submitted a document to the central government. (Title omitted) "We humbly note that business tax is related to local tax revenue. All industrial and commercial sectors should fulfill their tax obligations. However, an excessive tax rate will inevitably hinder the ability to bear the burden. It is found that the association previously due to the rosewood and sandalwood in the member's woodenware items, the business tax regulations for the sale of goods issued by Jiangsu Province stipulates that the tax rate is 20/1000. The association considered that this regulation violated the framework set by the Ministry and sent a telegram to various ministries and courtyards of the central government for amendment last month. Later, the Ministry of Finance replied in a telegram on a certain day, stating that the business tax rate for the oil paint and rosewood industries should be amended separately and replied to the provincial government for transfer to the provincial Finance Department for compliance. The newspaper reported on the 26th of this month that the Jiangsu Province business tax regulations for oil and paint categories are 2/1000, while the Western furniture and rosewood industries are still taxed at 10/1000, which does not clarify the situation of the rosewood industry. It is found that although rosewood materials are produced in Siam and are clearly imported goods, the increase in import tariffs has increased several times compared to the past. When arriving in Shanghai and entering the trade (i.e., the rosewood trade), the trade should pay business tax. When the trade wholesales to the rosewood dismantling industry, business tax should be paid. When the materials are manufactured into various appliances and wholesaled to woodenware shops, manufacturing business tax must be paid. When the woodenware shop sells rosewood appliances, an additional 10/1000 business tax is added. A raw material such as rosewood is taxed no less than four times when manufactured into an item. It is not known that the general rules of taxation are that the tax rate of raw materials and goods needed by the country is reduced or even exempted from tax. The appliances made of rosewood are necessary for household use. Although their price is more expensive than ordinary miscellaneous wood, they are of high quality, durable, and last for decades or centuries. They are not as easy to rot as other miscellaneous wood, so they are popular with those who are proficient in household management. Most of the appliances made are used by Chinese people, and it cannot be regarded as a luxury item for tax purposes. Moreover, since rosewood is imported into China and manufactured into finished products, it is subject to heavy business tax. Woodenware merchants will be on the verge of bankruptcy, and the livelihood of tens of thousands of fellow workers will be completely cut off. The distress of being unsustainable is also understood by the authorities. It is regrettable that our country's industry is declining and production is backward, and the products made of rosewood are finely carved and exquisitely styled. They have won the most honorable awards in various national goods exhibitions and competitions in Europe and the West, which is enough to show the progress of our country's fine arts and art. The authorities should promote and support the development of the inherent culture. The government should give special awards to the rosewood industry. The name of the business tax should be based on the industry as a unit, and the goal of taxation should not be based on the goods. The association has previously telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to correct the situation, but it has still not been able to be considerate. Now that the opportunity is pressing, we have to express our feelings and request that the original business tax rate for Western-style woodenware and rosewood industries be paid special attention to when the conference passes it. In accordance with the original tax amount of the oil paint industry, the maximum limit is to reduce it to 2/1000, so as to cultivate national production and take care of the livelihood of merchants and people. This is also the reason for retaining the art of our country's inherent industry and maintaining the lives of poor workers. Accordingly, we intend to formulate a special reason for reducing the business tax on rosewood and other categories, and send a telegram requesting that it be approved for implementation. We are extremely eager to wait for orders. The Shanghai Paint Industry Association seals the document.</p>
<h3 id="e124">The Unified Tax Office Prohibits Extortion <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance's Unified Tax Office issued a notice to various factories yesterday, stating that inspections of unified tax personnel sometimes involve extortion: "We hereby state that the collection of unified taxes at factories and customs is originally intended to facilitate merchants and people and eliminate accumulated malpractices. Merchants should comply with regulations and pay taxes without evading taxes or smuggling, and officials should be honest and impartial, and should not delay or extort. The director of this office has repeatedly warned and strictly prohibited this when he was in the Tobacco Unified Tax Office. Now he is also in charge of various unified tax affairs, which is busy and important. All subordinate officials should strive to improve their spirit and earnestly implement it. However, with the passage of time, they have become playful. Recently, it has been heard that inspection personnel still follow the old habits of the likin office and cannot avoid delaying and extorting fees for stamping procedures. Such behavior is superficially compliant but secretly violates the regulations, and it is extremely hateful. It should be investigated and punished severely. We hereby reiterate the ban and draw up a simple announcement for publication and posting to serve as a warning and rectify tax administration. In addition to issuing notices to all districts and offices for posting to inform the public, this announcement is hereby sent to your factory for reference. It is hoped that it will be posted together.</p>

<p>But No Tax Refunds If Heavily Taxed</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance's Unified Tax Office replied to the Yarn and Cloth Association: "We hereby reply that we have received your presentation regarding the transportation and sale of artificial hand-woven cloth within the country. If the raw materials are woven from cotton yarn that has already been subject to the unified tax, it should be exempt from the unified tax and customs duties. However, during the period of tax-exempt transportation, customs duties are still collected by customs according to the usual practice, and it is still requested that customs stop collecting now. Also, rural households buy yarn in small quantities to weave cloth, and they have never obtained a tax certificate. What kind of procedures will be used for the inspection and release of local cloth for transportation and transshipment in the future, and please verify and order compliance, etc. It is found that the order to exempt existing cotton yarn and its direct woven products from the unified tax before March 31st and to pay customs duties as usual when passing through customs is an open case handled in accordance with the Ministry's order. All hand-woven cloth cannot prove that it is woven from new yarn that has been taxed after February 1st. During the period when inventory is abundant, it is treated as inventory and customs duties are levied accordingly, which is very fair. And the deadline for exempting inventory from the unified tax is approaching. From April 1st, customs will be able to verify the unified tax certificate for this item.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>[Hunger&gt; Third Edition (10)</p>
<p>Local cloth can be verified with a unified tax certificate and released, and no tax will be levied again. The deadline is already very short, and all merchants should strictly comply with the regulations and must not be trivialized in order to maintain the original case. As for rural households buying yarn in small quantities and weaving it by hand, it is claimed that there is no way to obtain the original cotton yarn tax payment certificate, and it is difficult to prove that the raw materials have been subject to the unified tax. However, in order to show special consideration, this office will temporarily allow everyone to apply for a transport permit so that customs can verify it and release it. However, all hand-woven cloth, whether it is transported and sold abroad or in non-unified tax areas or in unified tax areas, will not be refunded if heavily taxed, to indicate restrictions. A stamp stating "Hand-woven cloth cannot be refunded" is added to the transport permit to identify it. In addition to instructing all bureaus to comply, we hereby reply for your reference."</p>
<h3 id="e126">News of the Sixth Congress of the International Chamber of Commerce <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Please add specialized commissioners</p>
<p>Please issue branch seals</p>
<p>Please issue congress dues</p>
<p>Delegates depart in mid-month</p>
<p>The Sixth Congress of the International Chamber of Commerce is scheduled to be held in Washington, D.C., on May 4th of this year. Our country has already established a Chinese branch, nominating Guo Bingwen, Bei Songsun, and Li Guoqin as representatives. However, several specialized commissioners should be appointed by the government. Yesterday, the association specifically telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, etc., requesting the government to appoint them, and also telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Railways, the Ministry of Transportation, and the Ministry of Industry, etc., to appoint them. The congress dues and travel expenses for the delegates are also requested to be issued. The following is a record of the telegrams:</p>
<p>Telegram requesting the dispatch of specialized commissioners: To the Nanjing Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Industry, Ministry of Transportation, and Ministry of Railways: The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce previously participated in the International Chamber of Commerce in the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, dispatching ten representatives and three specialized commissioners to attend the Fifth Congress of the International Chamber of Commerce. The Sixth Congress of the International Chamber of Commerce is scheduled to be held in Washington, D.C., on May 4th of this year. After the association was organized and established, it formally telegraphed its participation and nominated Bei Songsun, Guo Bingwen, Li Guoqin, and others as representatives. It is now found that the proposed agenda for this congress includes (1) measures to prevent the decline in silver prices, (2) the issue of claims against European debts, (3) the issue of German reparations, (4) the issue of gold hoarding by the United States and France and the concentration of gold, (5) the issue of global production restriction agreements, and (6) the issue of tariff barrier removal. The decline of our country's foreign trade and the losses from the high cost of gold and the low value of silver necessitate the dispatch of more representatives and specialized commissioners to attend and propose discussions on relief methods. In addition to the three representatives already nominated by the association, we hereby inform your departments, earnestly requesting approval to add representatives and specialized commissioners to attend, so that officials and merchants can cooperate and work together. We also hope for a reply to facilitate statistics on the number of attendees and budget for travel expenses. This is of utmost importance. Chen Guangfu, President of the Chinese Branch of the International Chamber of Commerce, and Guo Bingwen, Vice President, respectfully bow.</p>
<p>Petition for an official seal: A report regarding the organization and establishment of the Chinese Branch of the International Chamber of Commerce has been telegraphed to the International Chamber of Commerce for formal participation. Please examine and approve the record and issue an official seal for credibility. The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China previously participated in the International Chamber of Commerce in the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, dispatching representatives and specialized commissioners to attend the Fifth Congress of the International Chamber of Commerce, and preparing to organize the Chinese Committee of the International Chamber of Commerce. The articles of association have been attached and submitted for record, and a request has been made for financial assistance. Upon investigation, the articles of association of the International Chamber of Commerce seem to be based on the old system, which China should follow. Therefore, the name "Chinese Committee of the International Chamber of Commerce" has been changed to "Chinese Branch of the International Chamber of Commerce," and it was organized and established on February 7th of this year. Chen Guangfu was appointed as President, Guo Bingwen as Vice President, and Lin Kanghou as Secretary-General. They have taken office and telegraphed the International Chamber of Commerce to report formal participation. We hereby submit a report to your government and departments regarding the organization and establishment, requesting your examination and approval of the record and the issuance of an official seal for credibility. Please grant an approval order for compliance, as it is in the public interest. In addition to separate submissions, we respectfully submit this to the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Industry.</p>
<p>Request for dues: A report requesting the allocation of government subsidies of 30,000 silver dollars for the Sixth Congress of the International Chamber of Commerce. The expenses of the International Chamber of Commerce were previously submitted by the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China to the National Government, requesting a subsidy of 30,000 silver dollars for congress fees in the year of each congress and 10,000 silver dollars for annual expenses. An order was received to collect the congress fees for the eighteenth year. The Sixth Congress of the International Chamber of Commerce is scheduled to be held in Washington, D.C., on May 4th of this year. The association should be organized and established, and it has telegraphed formal participation and nominated Bei Songsun, Guo Bingwen, and Li Guoqin to attend. Efforts are still being made to add more representatives to attend. Once they are nominated, they will travel to the United States. Travel expenses for each representative should be prepared in advance. In addition to seeking other sources of funding, we hereby submit a report to your department regarding the request for government subsidies for the International Chamber of Commerce congress fees, requesting 30,000 silver dollars to be approved for collection. Please grant an approval order for compliance, as it is in the public interest. We respectfully submit this to the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p>Delegates will depart: A reporter from the Guowen News Agency visited Mr. Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, yesterday to inquire when our country's delegates would depart. According to Mr. Lin, Guo Bingwen, Bei Songsun, and Li Guoqin will depart from the country next month (i.e., April) around the fifteenth, lest they be too late to arrive, except for Mr. Bei, who is already in Europe and the United States examining the financial situation.</p>

<p>In the future, the general rates will inevitably be greater than the rent one day</p>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession is protesting the Municipal Council's destruction of municipal principles. It is reported that the assessment of rent for the collection of general rates has actually increased the rate from 1% to 20%. The entire city is unanimously opposed to the Municipal Council, but there has been no concrete response. The following is the letter from the Taxpayers' Association to the Municipal Council:</p>
<p>Taxpayers' Association to the Municipal Council: We are writing in response to the letter from the Shanghai Zhongshe (see yesterday's newspaper), which included a draft letter, certificate, lease, rent receipt, etc. Upon investigation, the association believes that your council's act of destroying municipal financial principles by assessing rent for the collection of general rates and actually increasing the rate is inappropriate and should be corrected. We have repeatedly sent letters to this effect. We hereby request that you investigate and handle the case, and promptly cancel the action of increasing the rate, so as to avoid causing major disputes. To the Municipal Council.</p>
<p>Taxpayers' Association to Zhongshe: We are writing in response to your letter of today, regarding the Municipal Council's assessment of rent for the collection of general rates, which is equivalent to a huge increase in the rate, and requesting negotiations. The attachments have been received. The association has repeatedly reported this matter and sent letters to the Municipal Council requesting the cancellation of this measure, which is inconsistent with municipal financial principles. We have learned that the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Preparatory Committee of the Citizens' Association of the Special District have also sent letters to the Municipal Council making the same claim. In the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, the association actively protested the Municipal Council's increase of the police rate by two li from the autumn of that year for the benefit of all taxpayers. The increase in the police rate calculated by the Municipal Council based on the estimated rent is far more than two li. As your association stated, it has increased from 4% to over 20%. According to our knowledge, it has even increased from 1.4% to over 26%. If this bad precedent is set, there will inevitably be a day when the police rate is greater than the rent. Will taxpayers still have the ability to bear the burden? In addition to sending a letter to the Municipal Council, we hereby reply for your information. The attachments are temporarily stored here.

<p>All ports should follow the lead of Shanghai's Qian Industry</p>
<p>Since the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau proposed the year-end closing period for industrial and commercial accounting in the twentieth year and solicited opinions from various industries, the Shanghai Qian Industry unanimously agreed that the end of January of the following year was the most appropriate. After sending letters to various port industry associations, they have recently received letters from various port industry associations unanimously agreeing. In addition to the letters from the Nanjing and Wuhu Qian Industry Associations that were published in yesterday's newspaper, we have now obtained five more letters from Nantong, Jiangdu, Jiujiang, Qingdao, and Yingkou, which are reproduced below:</p>
<p>Nantong Qian Industry Association: Upon receiving your letter and attachments, we greatly admire your foresight in setting the year-end closing period for the twentieth year at the end of January and advocating for its adoption. We should unanimously support it to achieve the goal. We have already transcribed the message to various industries to jointly strive for it. In addition to writing an article based on the intention of your esteemed association and requesting the county chamber of commerce to forward it to the Executive Yuan and ministries, we still hope for your guidance at any time.</p>
<p>Jiangdu Qian Industry Association: Upon receiving your letter requesting to determine the national industrial and commercial accounting year, and based on the proposal of the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to set the end of February as the year-end closing period and sending letters to various industry associations to solicit opinions, the association convened a general meeting of all members to discuss it in detail. The members unanimously agreed that setting the end of February as the year-end closing period has various obstacles and advocated that setting the end of January as the year-end closing period is the most appropriate. This has been unanimously approved and the reasons have been detailed in a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce requesting its adoption. After receiving your esteemed letter, the association immediately convened a general meeting of all members to discuss it. The members unanimously stated that the proposal of your esteemed association is very insightful and not only benefits the Qian Industry but also benefits commerce and agriculture. This is especially admired by our colleagues. In addition to informing the county chamber of commerce, we hereby send a special letter to express our association's agreement.</p>
<p>Jiujiang Qian Industry Association: Upon receiving your letter of the thirteenth and three drafts, we are fully aware of everything. Regarding the so-called end of January as the year-end closing period, the association immediately convened a general meeting of all members for discussion.

<h3 id="e130">News of the Dissolution of the National Pharmaceutical Federation <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Remarks by Zhang Meian, Standing Committee Member</p>
<p>The National Federation of Pharmaceutical Organizations of this city was previously dissolved by the 131st Standing Committee Meeting of the Central Government. According to Mr. Zhang Meian, a standing committee member of the association, the news of the association's dissolution was only seen in the Central Government's resolution of the 131st Standing Committee Meeting published in the local newspapers on March 6th. However, as of today, the Central Government has not yet sent a clear order of dissolution to the association. However, since the Central Government has made a resolution to dissolve it, the association should comply with it. Therefore, the association has already resolved at a standing committee meeting to prepare for dissolution. Once the clear order arrives, work can be stopped. However, the pharmaceutical organizations under the association are located throughout the country, and there are also many branches overseas. The association is jointly organized by the medical, pharmaceutical, and labor sectors nationwide. When the organization was initially established, it was intended to concentrate efforts to jointly develop the pharmaceutical industry, so the cooperation of the medical, pharmaceutical, and labor sectors was painstakingly constructed. Now that the association has been ordered to dissolve, the branches in various provinces, cities, and counties will of course be dissolved uniformly, and the spirit of cooperation between the medical, pharmaceutical, and labor sectors will be fundamentally eliminated. This is regrettable. However, the reason why the Central Government is dissolving the association this time is precisely because it has violated the organizational regulations of people's organizations by mixing the medical, pharmaceutical, and labor sectors. The country's legislation is such, and the association should obey the decision of the Central Government. As for the national medical and pharmaceutical sectors after the association is dissolved, they can continue the spirit of the past and implement unity in accordance with the law. However, medicine and pharmaceuticals are different paths and should go their separate ways. When the Central National Medicine Hall held a preparatory conference in the capital last month, many representatives of medical and pharmaceutical organizations from various places went to Beijing to attend. During the interval, they made a detailed discussion on the issue of the association's dissolution. As a result, the majority advocated that after the association is dissolved, the medical side should follow the example of the National Physicians' Association and the medical colleagues in various places should initiate the organization of the National Chinese Medicine Federation. The pharmaceutical side should follow the regulations of the industry and commerce guild law and the pharmaceutical colleagues in various places should initiate the organization of the National Chinese Medicine Guild Federation. In the future, the two associations will be located in one place and can still contact each other for handling matters. This plan meets the needs and complies with the laws and regulations. If it can be realized, then even though the association is dissolved, it will not have any impact on the entire national Chinese medicine. The Central Government will definitely approve the establishment without any doubt. Tracing back to the establishment of the association on March 17th of the eighteenth year, it first passed the abolition of Chinese medicine case with the Central Health Committee and fought against it with all its strength. Finally, relying on the efforts of colleagues nationwide, it won the sympathy of people from all walks of life and fundamentally abolished this bill. The following year, the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Education issued orders prohibiting Chinese medicine from establishing schools, Chinese medicine from establishing hospitals, and Chinese medicine from using Western instruments and methods to treat people's diseases. Regarding the pharmaceutical aspect, there were also so-called regulations for the management of pharmaceutical merchants. In essence, all of its contents were sufficient to fetter the future development of China's medical and pharmaceutical industry. The harm to China's medical and pharmaceutical community in this environment is unspeakable. Subsequently, the association convened the Second National Congress of Medical and Pharmaceutical Organizations. It was unanimously resolved in Shanghai to nominate myself and Mr. Qiu Jisheng to go to Beijing to petition. Fortunately, Chairman Chiang was wise and decisive and immediately issued a handwritten instruction to abolish the ordinances that imprisoned Chinese medicine and pharmaceuticals. Thus, the Chinese medicine and pharmaceuticals that were on the verge of death had a chance to survive. However, the association was still worried that the status of national medicine and pharmaceuticals could not be consolidated. It also requested the Executive Yuan to follow the example of the National Health Hall and prepare to establish the Central National Medicine Hall as the hub for the revitalization of Chinese medicine and pharmaceuticals. It also relied on the assistance of the late President Tan and the Central Committee members Chen Lifu and Jiao Yitang to submit it to the Central Political Conference for approval to establish it. Now the Central National Medicine Hall has been established by advanced party and state officials. The task of the association can be completed. Counting the past work of the association, although there has not been much achievement, it has fortunately avoided the danger of falling. This is what all colleagues of the association can tell the medical and pharmaceutical colleagues nationwide.</p>

<p>All those over one yuan should be stamped with one cent</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce issued a notice to various industries in this city through the industry association yesterday, stating that on the 30th of this month, it received a letter from the Shanghai Special Zone Stamp Tax Office of the Jiangsu Stamp Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Bureau, stating that the Chinese Chemical Industry Corporation had stated in its letter that invoices issued by stores are different in nature from silver and money documents and should be exempt from stamping. Please explain so that it can be followed, etc. Accordingly, the office replied that invoices are certificates for urging payment of debts. According to social customs, when a debt is received, a receipt is not issued separately. Therefore, they are stamped separately according to the silver and money receipts. Later, an order was received from the Ministry of Finance that in order to show consideration for the hardships of merchants, all foreign amounts above one yuan should be stamped with one cent and no additional stamps should be affixed. This has been followed for a long time. Before the revised Stamp Tax Law is promulgated, it should still be handled according to the original plan. In view of the foregoing, a letter is hereby issued to inform you so that you can follow it.</p>

<p>Donations from philanthropists will be used</p>
<p>Without using a single penny of the relief funds</p>
<p>The Shanghai community has launched the Shaanxi Disaster Relief Association because Mr. Zhu Ziqiao, President of the North China Charity Association, personally led relief efforts in Shaanxi last year with huge sums of money raised himself, fearing no hardship and sparing no effort, which is difficult for others to do. Therefore, the relief funds received in the past ten days have reached 200,000. What is particularly noteworthy is that the costs of advertising, printing, donation books, receipt books, and stationery, as well as the expenses of accounting clerks, etc., have been completely donated and paid for by philanthropists without using a single penny of the relief funds, so that every penny raised can reach the disaster victims. The donated amounts are listed below: Wu Zhihao 300 yuan, Zhu Ziqiao 200 yuan, Wang Yiting 100 yuan, Wang Xiaolai 100 yuan, Huang Hanzhi 100 yuan, Zhang Gongquan 100 yuan, Yuan Ludeng 100 yuan, Yu Youren 100 yuan, Kang Jiyao 100 yuan, Li Yunshu 100 yuan, Zhu Yinjiang 100 yuan, Qingzhen Board of Directors 100 yuan, Wang Yunfu 100 yuan, Tang Mufen 100 yuan, 蕢延芳 100 yuan, Sun Longji 50 yuan, Jin Guanfu 50 yuan, Shang Yunting 50 yuan, totaling 1,950 yuan.

<p>Passenger trains delayed</p>
<p>At 1:30 p.m. yesterday, the No. 34 locomotive on the Jinghu Railway was sending eight coal cars to the coal yard road when the foremost car suddenly fell into the track at a junction, blocking the tracks. Since the location was also the entrance and exit for cars on the Jinghu, Hangzhou, and Ningbo lines, the train to Beijing from the gate, as well as the Shanghai-Changzhou, Shanghai-Wuxi, and Hangzhou No. 8 express trains and the No. 10 Beijing-Hangzhou trains, were all detained at the North Station and could not depart on time. The workers from the engine factory immediately tried to empty the coal cars and put them back on the tracks. It was not until about 6:40 p.m. that the tracks were cleared and the trains were able to depart. Each train was delayed for more than an hour.</p>

<p>Although there are minor issues, they are not a problem</p>
<p>The Great America Evening News reported that the Municipal Council of the Public Concession had set the end of March as the deadline for dog racing in the dog racing grounds. From tonight onwards, they should be closed. Today, the Dog Racing Association, which operates Mingyuan, sent a letter to the Municipal Council stating that the association's board of directors has no intention of opposing any actions taken by the Municipal Council for the public interest. However, due to environmental inconveniences, it cannot stop dog racing on its own. Therefore, unless the Municipal Council takes active measures to interfere, it will continue to race dogs. It is scheduled to hold races as usual this Saturday. However, if the Municipal Council starts negotiations to resolve the issue at this time, the association is willing to postpone it indefinitely. In addition, it mentioned the issue of compensation that was understood by both parties during informal negotiations in November last year. However, a reporter asked a person from the Municipal Council, who said that the Municipal Council will take the necessary steps to stop dog racing. In addition, it is heard that Mingyuan has signed numerous contracts with employees and other related parties. It must wait for the Municipal Council to forcibly close it down before it can be considered an irresistible environment as stipulated in the contract before the restrictions can be lifted.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Seven Investors Plan to Purchase the Majestic Hotel <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Becoming an International Organization</p>
<p>Zhang Qun Expresses Support</p>
<p>Prominent figures from Chinese and foreign banking and industrial circles in this city established an international association on the 28th of last month. The seven members, including Li Fusun, manager of the Zhejiang Industrial Bank in this city, Benjamin, director of the Shanghai Land Company, David, representative of Sassoon &amp; Co., and Sir Robert Ho Tung of Hong Kong, unanimously resolved last night that, since the Municipal Council is unwilling to spend 3.5 million taels to acquire the Majestic Hotel property, they will jointly purchase it by April 15th to serve as a central hub for society and a venue for Chinese and foreign individuals. The detailed information regarding the organization of this international group is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Equal Investment Each of the seven members of this international group represents various commercial organizations from China and abroad. Each will contribute 500,000 taels, totaling 3.5 million taels, to acquire the Majestic Hotel property. At the same time, it was decided that all internal architecture would be completely preserved. Benjamin initially proposed using the Majestic building as a venue for activities for Chinese individuals. Later, Li Fusun advocated using it as an international center. Consequently, it was resolved to establish an international organization without national or racial boundaries. Last night, this international group held a dinner party. Shanghai Mayor Zhang Qun requested Mr. Li Fusun to deliver a speech on behalf of the group, expressing congratulations and offering to provide assistance to the best of his ability.</p>
<p>Banking Consortium Mr. Li Fusun represents prominent figures in Shanghai's banking sector, including Chen Guangfu, manager of the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, and Zhang Jia'ao, manager of the Bank of China. The movement for this proposition has been ongoing for some time, deeply fearing that the Municipal Council's rejection of the acquisition of the Majestic Hotel would lead to the solemn and magnificent building becoming ruins, which would be a great pity. Furthermore, according to those familiar with the real estate situation, the price of 3.5 million taels in the Jing'an Temple area is currently a particularly low price, only an increase of 800,000 taels compared to the previous purchase price.</p>
<h3 id="e140">The Debt of the Riye Bank Has Not Yet Been Distributed <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Greatly Different from What Was Said in Yesterday's Newspaper</p>
<p>There Is Still Hope for Full Repayment in the Future</p>
<p>Directors Must Advance at Least 20% in Cash</p>
<p>The Sale of Shops Is Progressing Actively</p>
<p>Yesterday, this newspaper reported on the case of the Riye Bank liquidation heard by the Mixed Court of the French Concession, stating that accountants Wu Zheng and Pan Zhaobang, among others, claimed that lawsuits had been filed against those who had not repaid their debts to various accounts, and that many had already been repaid, allowing for a preliminary distribution of 20% to each creditor. Upon investigation, this information does not match the facts. It was found that what accountants Wu and Pan said at the time was that, although the pursuit of debts from various accounts was actively underway, the estimated total debt of the company was significantly different from what was needed to fully repay all debts. Therefore, they requested the court to order the shareholders and directors of the company to advance at least 20% in cash so that distribution could be made as soon as possible, not that there was already sufficient money available for a preliminary distribution of 20%.</p>
<p>According to another report, since the French Concession court appointed accountants Wu Zheng and Pan Zhaobang to liquidate the Riye Bank, they have been actively pursuing debts and selling off various institutions affiliated with the Gongfa Company. Yesterday, someone met with accountants Wu and Pan to inquire about the progress of future debt repayment. They said that most of the debts owed to the Riye Bank were related to the Gongfa Company and Huang Chujiu, making it particularly difficult to recover them. As of yesterday, only a little over 40,000 yuan had been received in scattered payments. The Chinese and Western pharmacy was sold for 240,000 yuan, but the deposit had not yet been paid. The hot spring bathhouse was sold for 50,000 yuan, but the deal had not been finalized due to rental issues. Even if the above two deals could be completed and added to the scattered payments received, it would still be difficult to distribute even 10%. Yesterday's report mentioned a 20% distribution, but that is not yet possible. As for future repayment plans, efforts must be made to fully repay the creditors, as the creditors of the bank are mostly women and laborers. It is currently planned to sell off each of the Gongfa Company's shops one by one and auction off Huang Chujiu's estate. If that is not enough, a request will be submitted to the French Concession court to order the shareholders and directors to pursue repayment.</p>

The Special Court scheduled the trial for March 31, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, the date for the trial arrived. Defendants Huang and Gao, as well as the plaintiff, arrived in turn. However, Zhang Xingheng alone did not arrive. Judge Feng Shide ascended to the Fifth Court. Due to the time spent examining other cases, this case was not addressed until the clock struck five. Furthermore, the plaintiff, Zheng Lanru, could only speak the Yue dialect, making it difficult for the judge to understand. An interpreter was needed, but the interpreters familiar with the Yue dialect in the court had already left work and returned home, so the examination could not proceed. Judge Feng then ordered that the examination be postponed to Saturday afternoon of this week.</p>

Judge Zhou Daren of the Civil Court took on the case and began arguments on the 23rd of last month. The plaintiff's agent, H.P. Maine, and two foreign lawyers elaborated on the plaintiff's reasons for demolishing the houses for reconstruction. The tenants' lawyers, Xue Jiaqi and Wang Zuxun, refuted the legality of the plaintiff's demolition activities based on legal principles.

<p>Since Qin Yanqi and Zhu Cisheng Took Over as Director and Deputy Director of the Shanghai Charity Association Tongren Fuyuan Hall, They Have Seriously Rectified the Affairs of Various Departments, Which Are Gradually Coming into Order.

There Are Eight Types of Coffins: Wealth, Prosperity, Longevity, Happiness, Celebration, Regular, Deputy, and General. They Are All Sold at the Actual Cost of the Materials and Labor for Making the Coffins, Without Taking Any Profit. Recently, Due to the Sharp Rise in Lumber Prices and the Increase in Labor and Materials Costs, Selling at the Original Prices Is Not Enough to Cover the Costs. The Board of Directors of the Charity Association Has Resolved to Appropriately Increase the Prices. Except for the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall on Avenue Ningbo in the Concession, Which Is Selling at Actual Prices with Lower Subsidies, the Main Hall Will Still Have a Semi-Credit System for the Regular, Deputy, and General Coffins. Based on a Comparison of Last Year's Credit Amounts, More Than Ten Thousand Jin Will Still Need to Be Subsidized Annually. Therefore, New Coffin Prices Have Been Set to Maintain the Cost, Effective from the First Day of This Month. The Prices of Each Type of Coffin Are Recorded Below: Wealth, 126 Yuan; Prosperity, 110 Yuan; Longevity, 80 Yuan; Happiness, 66 Yuan; Celebration, 54 Yuan; Regular, 32 Yuan; Deputy, 20 Yuan; General, 16 Yuan.</p>

Therefore, the Shanghai Trade Association held a joint meeting to decide that, due to the different jurisdictions, the first step would be for Shanghai to petition the Shanghai Municipal Government, and for the counties to jointly petition the provincial government, in order to achieve a unified approach.</p>

<p>— Chen Boying</p>
<p>What day is today if not April 1st? This day is no different from any other day of the month in our country. However, in France, it is a strange day. What is strange? It is that everyone can lie on this day. The origin of lying is said to be that Jesus lied to escape from difficulties on April 1st, and later generations commemorated Jesus by designating this day as a day for lying. Therefore, on this day, one can deceive others and be deceived by others. It is said that one person met a friend on the road, and the friend said that the neighbor was careless and that their house would be affected. The person hurried home, but everything was fine, so he realized he had been deceived. Another person planned how to fool an acquaintance after leaving home. He met a friend who was walking in a hurry. When asked where he was going, he said that he had important business. He also said that he would have dinner at a famous restaurant in two hours and invited the person to go with him. The person agreed, and the friend hurried away. When the time came, he went to look for his friend but could not find him, and he realized that he had been deceived. Others may invite guests on behalf of someone, but the host had not made such an invitation; or they may make an appointment but not find the place; or they may order something that is not urgent. These are all castles in the air, focusing on the unreal and neglecting the real. I think that on this day, everyone should pay attention to the words of others, which actually contain a lesson. Also, throughout the year, people always say serious things. It is especially interesting to have one day when one can break free from the shackles of honesty and escape from the norm, without causing any harm. The world may have people who enjoy this and make every day like April 1st, but that is beyond my knowledge.</p>

<h3 id="e183">Interesting Facts from the Half-Yearly Meeting of the Child Welfare Association <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>The Chinese Child Welfare Association is jointly established by Chinese and American educators, collecting donations to promote the happiness of children. The half-yearly members' meeting was held at the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce on Saturday (the 28th). Half of the members who attended were Chinese and half were Westerners. In addition to reporting on the association's affairs in the past half-year, famous people were invited to give speeches. Here are some interesting excerpts from the meeting:</p>
<p>On this day, the association's order sheets and other materials were all in light green, which was different from the usual white used in meetings. It is said that doctors value the color green, and the association is charitable and dedicated to educating poor children, so it adopted this color. Dozens of photos of children when they were taken in and after they entered the hospital, as well as various charts, were hung throughout the meeting venue. In the past six months, 127 helpless children have been taken in, 63 of whom have been selected to enter the educational institutions set up by the association. The rest have been fostered in Xiangshan Orphanage and Taian Orphanage, etc. Chairman Kong Yongzhi, Deputy Chairman Luo Yunyan, and Mrs. Guo Bingwen all had matters and asked for leave, so Executive Committee member Le Lingsheng (transliteration) was elected as chairman. During the opening speech, he spoke in English, which was translated by General Secretary Wu Weide. Then, he reported that from April to December of the 19th year, a total of 29,833.55 yuan was spent on five items: child protection, child education, child health, child research, and social education. Next, Dr. Peter Hui (transliteration), a health expert, gave a speech on child health. Dr. Hui spoke in English, describing the history of child welfare work in the United States in great detail. He held a manuscript in his left hand and a piece of chalk in his right, like a teacher giving a lecture in a school. He spoke and gestured for half an hour, and two Western women recorded with pens and listened attentively, taking it very seriously. After the speech, he smiled and spoke in Chinese, saying that the infant mortality rate in the United States has gradually decreased in recent years. After China pays attention to child health, there will be fewer deaths after birth, and the birth rate should also be considered in terms of population increase. Dr. Hui had been in China for a long time and spoke fluent Chinese. Next, Dr. Chen Heqin, a child education expert, spoke on child education, saying that parental education is the foundation of child education. Children imitate a lot, and the actions of parents unconsciously instill the nature of children. The general parental education in our country is not yet perfect and has a great impact. He gave examples to prove his words and said that being a parent is not easy. The audience laughed. Then, Wang Xiaolai gave a speech, saying that strict fathers and kind mothers are in line with education and cultivation. He dared to say that the children of everyone present are not as numerous as his. This statement caused everyone to laugh. He also said that he had the most children, and after educating the older ones well, the others would follow suit. He cited facts to prove this. He could not remember the names of his dozens of children, so when he came home from work, he ordered them to line up in order, which he did every day. The youngest ones saw that their older brothers and sisters were standing upright in front of him. Although they had just learned to walk and their footing was unstable, they also followed their older siblings and stood still, which showed that children's imitation comes from nature. By analogy, the older ones are well-behaved, and the younger ones learn from them, saving a lot of effort. Finally, he also said that after reading the coffin donation report of Pushan Villa, he learned that an average of 100 children die in Shanghai every day, and most of the origins of the disease are nothing more than excessive hunger and cold, and uneven heating and cooling. If parents can understand the methods of education and cultivation, there would not be so many infant deaths. He hoped that everyone present would expand the publicity of child health methods so that everyone would know, which would be of great merit.</p>

<p>— Luxi Layman</p>
<p>Reading the two sentences "easy to agree with the same voice" and "same spirit seeks each other" in books, I thought that the ancients must have had the actual traces of responding and seeking, not just made up empty words. Living in today's world, observing the invention of wireless electricity, I sighed that the principle of responding to requests is in line with it. People ask private words, and heaven hears them like thunder. If people do not believe it, just look at the agility of wireless electricity. Even if separated by thousands of miles, it can knock here and respond there. Experts know that it is because the degree of electrical waves in the air is the same. The degree of good and evil in people's hearts also has the same seat number and different degrees. If goodness and goodness are the same degree, then the reward must be good, and if evil and evil are the same degree, then the reward must be evil. The innumerable thoughts of all beings flow invisibly, like electrical waves traveling through the air, which cannot be seen by the naked eye. Once it encounters the same degree, it will trigger without any error. It can be known that whether it is good or evil is created by the mind. Although the intention is very subtle, it can be magnified without end. The so-called misfortune and fortune have no door, but people invite themselves. No matter whether they are wise or foolish, those who understand this principle can be without a fierce introspection. The villain occasionally feels ashamed that he is not an expert and cannot speak freely, but borrows him to solicit this, and wishes to question all the people in the world who have the mind to seek, promote, and teach the world and the people. Isn't it helpful?</p>

<h3 id="e185">The Supervising Committee Member as Monk in the Control Yuan <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— By Man Yin</p>
<p>Among the newly appointed supervising committee members of the National Government's Control Yuan, Mr. Xie Wuliang deeply appreciates Zen philosophy and has published works such as "History of Buddhism." His residence in Beijing is called "Compassion Society." His physique resembles the Maitreya Buddha, and his aspirations are always filled with compassion. Consequently, his peers call him "Monk Xie." Following Su Manshu's "Monk Su," there is now also "Monk Xie." However, the Control Yuan's duty is to impeach and investigate, and now "Monk Xie" uses the compassionate gaze of a Bodhisattva to become the fierce glare of a Vajra. Although Wuliang indulges in the joys of Zen, he is ultimately a lay Buddhist. However, it is heard that there is indeed one supervising committee member who practices as a monk, namely, Mr. Ye Quan from Yunnan Province. Ye was originally a brave revolutionary, courageously fighting the enemy, and all who were pointed to by his banner collapsed. However, "one general's success is built upon ten thousand bones turned to dust." From a Buddhist perspective, one ultimately feels the suffering of sentient beings who have encountered this great calamity, which is beyond words. Ye originally had a predestined connection and encountered a wise teacher, a high monk from Mount Emei, who advised him, "The world is turbulent, and the atmosphere of killing pervades the universe. Why does layman also follow and enter the vortex?" Ye explained the difficulty of withdrawing, as the soldiers' loyalty depended entirely on the general, otherwise there would be disintegration. The high monk sighed deeply, "Layman has already broken the precept against killing, so there is nothing that can be done. But you should bravely retreat from the rapid current. The so-called 'lay down the butcher's knife and immediately become a Buddha.'" The layman remembered this. One month and one day, if you see a red light hanging high in the air, do not advance rashly, but immediately rein in your horse and return. Otherwise, you will suffer a fatal disaster. People may be able to advance bravely, but they often cannot retreat bravely. Layman, firmly remember my words." As a result, during a certain battle, Ye Quan was pursuing the enemy in victory, his momentum unstoppable. In the dark night, he suddenly saw a red light in the sky. Ye Quan immediately remembered the high monk's words and immediately ordered the army to retreat. The red light was the enemy's signal. If they had gone deeper, the entire army would have been annihilated. Ye then realized that killing begets killing, and the cycle continues endlessly. He shaved his head, entered the mountains, and took refuge in the emptiness. Although this resembles a myth, the Control Yuan summoned Ye, but they could not find his whereabouts. Ye's inability to take office is no longer in doubt. This monk supervising committee member will remain vacant for a long time.</p>

<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>The rhinoceros (Rhinoceroo) is as large as a large ox, with a long face and a single horn in front that is not very large, but its skin is extremely thick and wrinkled, resembling armor and somewhat similar to elephant skin. Its color is ashen gray when in the mud. A mother hippopotamus with a small hippopotamus (Hippotamns), reddish-purple in color, is also as large as the rhinoceros, with a similar face. However, they are still at a distance of twenty or thirty steps when viewed. The method of raising them is also in mud. Their skin is also very thick. I saw a giraffe, which was the first time in my life. According to my research, it should be called a giraffe, which is not wrong. The English name is Giraffe, which is translated as "camel leopard," as its markings resemble those of a leopard, and its species resembles a camel, according to the English name's explanation. However, ancient studies of the giraffe mention a cow's tail, horse's hooves, fleshy horns, and deer's ears, and its shape also matches. Some people also translate it as "long-headed deer," and the deer is a deer-like animal. It is a vegetarian with high moral character. Its head is small and its neck is long, reaching up to eighteen feet. Among all animals, it can look down on everything. The transliteration "giraffe" is likely a native African word. In Africa, they live in herds of thousands, as seen in movies. When the world is united and all nations communicate, it is like the ancient saying, "a auspicious sign of a king." However, this creature has unique skills. Its tongue can thread a needle's eye, and its hooves can kick down a tiger. Its kick is extremely fast, faster than the human eye can blink, and it arrives on the body instantly. Its speed is evident. I believe that this creature must be the giraffe. Therefore, tigers and leopards do not dare to harm this vegetarian animal, so it can lead the beasts. I placed beans in my hand, and it stretched its head to take food from my palm. A Western woman gave it green grass, and it also took it from her palm. Its nature and virtue are similar to that of a deer, without any ferocity. It is docile and gentle, yet capable of subduing tigers and leopards, truly an auspicious creature. There is also a creature similar to a strange monkey (Mandril), shaped like a demon king, frightening, with a red nose, ears, and mouth with patterns, five claws, and a tail and buttocks that are all crimson red. There are also flower-faced small monkeys and long-tailed monkeys, two or three feet long. In general, many animals come from Africa. There are two types of zebras, one with full stripes and one with half stripes. Only the four limbs are striped, and the stripes on the upper body are very few. This is likely due to interbreeding with other species of horses, so the stripes gradually decrease. Zebras are nothing special and resemble donkeys. I gave them beans, and they also took them from my hand. Their smell is very similar to that of donkeys. I find the Chinese idiom "the donkey of Guizhou" very strange, because there are no donkeys in Guizhou and Guangxi. I once asked a person from Guangxi, and they replied that the land is hot, and the donkeys' hooves are thin and cannot withstand the heat, so they cannot be raised. But I do not believe it, because Guangxi is mountainous and the roads are difficult, and all carrying is done by manual labor. If donkeys could be raised, it would greatly reduce the suffering of the people. According to geography, present-day Africa and Egypt are also near the equator, within ten degrees of latitude. Why is it that even before reaching the tropics, donkeys cannot be raised in Guizhou and Guangxi? Yesterday, I read Herbert Spencer's biography, which stated that he often rode donkeys when traveling in Egypt. Why is it that donkeys cannot be raised even before reaching the tropics in Guizhou and Guangxi? I do not believe it. There were large snakes, but I could not see them because the houses were being repaired. Finally, I saw several lions, ashen gray and appearing old and experienced. The males had long manes and were large, while the females were small and without manes. This indicates the natural aggressiveness of the males. South of Annam, tigers are often used to represent power. In India, lions and elephants are preferred. In Western languages, the word for "king" is "lion." Buddha compared himself to a lion's roar. Pictures often depict beautiful women submitting to elephants, which represents the psychology of the expression of power in the natural world.</p>
<p>There are also many women in the park. Aside from a few with the custom of nose piercing, the ordinary Indian women's clothing is somewhat similar to the Guanyin headdress in Chinese paintings, which is very beautiful. However, because Indians are darker due to the heat of the sun, their beauty is ultimately inferior. The wealthy women in Western attire are no less adorned than Western women. Human efforts can surpass nature, and relying solely on nature is insufficient.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a roar erupted, with the force of a mountain valley rushing forth. This is called a lion's roar. I also left the park. The sunlight was shrouded in the evening mist.</p>

<h3 id="e187">Gold Price Exceeds 700 Taels <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>The Result of Advancement: An Increase of 9.4 Taels</p>
<p>As a result of continuous advances, the gold price continued its peak yesterday, March 31st, exceeding the 700 tael mark. The state of gradual agility and stability, however, was such that the prices rose and fell incessantly throughout the day, with a total fluctuation of 14 taels. Looking back, the price hovered around 700 taels in the early market and remained above 705 taels thereafter. As the foreign exchange market tightened, the listed prices remained unchanged. However, trading was varied at the counter, and speculators took different paths. In the early market, Hengxing, Yuansen, Changchang, Yongyuan, Maoyu, Yuda, and others were buying, while Yongheng, Yuansheng, Zhifeng, Yongtong, Taichang, Jingda, and the Dalian Gang were selling. The overseas silver market had fallen again, and public sentiment was agitated. The gold price opened high and surged by 10 taels. Then, a large account, Yongheng, emerged to counter the shorts. Furthermore, buyers were excited, and the exchange rate improved, reaching 710 taels. In the later market, the Dalian Gang and Qianchangxiang, Zhifengyong, etc., bought, and as the Indian exchange rate fell, they initially showed great momentum, soaring beyond 710 taels, with an apparent upward trend. Later, Hengxing and others sold off and returned to a stable position. Afterwards, the exchange rate was peaceful between 705 taels, and the bank was still willing to sell. It is said that large accounts today may see a continued decline.</p>
<p>The Opening is an Angry Jump: The opening price for May contracts this morning rose by as much as 9.40 cash, calculated as 705 taels. It is said that large accounts reported a drop of 5/16, with a long-term decline of 1/4, and the silver price also shrank by 1/2. The European market was quiet, and private telegrams also showed a small decrease of 3/8. Furthermore, Maoyuyong and Wupin immediately advanced, so another 5 cash were added, with only 1 tael of fluctuation, from 04.5 taels to 5.5 taels. In an instant, the sellers were very diligent. Cuichang, Yongyuan, Chengtong, Taichang, and the Dalian Gang all came to sell, turning downwards. Furthermore, as British gold seemed to loosen, the June settlement could be 1375. Then, the banks mutually quoted near-term prices, all reaching the same figure. When the initial bidding was announced, it fell to within 700 taels, and the listed price did not change, continuing to decline to 698 taels. At this time, Yongheng, Yuancheng, and others all sold off. However, within a moment, there was approximately 1 tael of fluctuation. It is said that the June Citibank contract from Taiwan sold for 32 yuan, and Mitsui offered a near-term British gold contract at 1375. After 10 o'clock, it tended to rise again because Maoyuyong and the speculator Mr. Wu chased after it, so it had already cleared the threshold. Immediately afterwards, it rose sharply. It is said that Hengxing, Changsheng, Yongtong, Taichang, Hengxing, Yuanqianxiang, and others were competing to buy. As foreign exchange tightened, Mitsui advanced Dalian by 1.5 cash, 4.75 cents. HSBC ate a British gold contract for April at 13.6875, and the gold price soared by 10 taels, reaching 710 taels at 11:00. After a moment, Hengxing, Wanxing, Shunli, and others took the opportunity to sell off, so it was difficult to maintain the price for long, and it retreated by 4 taels. At 11:30, it was 06 taels. Hengxing, Yuantong, Taichang advanced again. At noon, it rose to 09 taels. At the close, the listed price for 08.5 taels was still calculated as 759 taels, with a small discount of 60 taels to 50 taels.</p>
<p>A Slight Evening: In the afternoon market, the opening price was 708 taels, and the Indian exchange rate fell by 5 annas, reaching as high as 10 taels and 3 cash. Then, it fell back by 2 taels, and the account was sold off. Furthermore, the Indian exchange rate was again low by 5 annas, and there were more buyers on the counter than usual. Mitsui bought Dalian by 1.5 cash, 5.625 cents, and immediately rose to 12 taels. Then, Hengxing and others entered the market to sell, and as British gold was willing to sell at 1362.5 cash, it fell sharply by more than 5 taels, reaching around 06.5 taels at about 2:30. Suddenly, it rose well by more than 2 taels, calculated as 09 taels. Then, Shunlichangsheng and Yong bought. After 3 o'clock, the trend softened, and there were also many sellers, especially Huayin, which once sold a June British gold contract at 1368.75. The Dalian Gang and Hengxing etc. made a closing advance, thus came to sell notes, and so there was a fall of three or four taels. However, in half an hour there were two taels of盘头. After 4 o'clock it was only 04.5 cash, and about to close at 06 cash. Finally, at 4:30 the closing was 705 taels, an increase of 9.4 cash compared to the previous day. However, buyers suddenly flourished again and轰至 08 taels and zero, so Wupin did挹 two taels. The highest price for the day was 712 taels, the lowest price was 698 taels, with a difference of 14 taels. In the morning market, Wupin opened at 05 taels, closed at noon at 08 taels, and closed in the afternoon at 8.2 cash and 07 taels respectively. The list price was calculated at a discount of 50 taels to 47 or 48 taels, and finally 53 or 54 taels. The book-entry was 05 taels to 09 taels and the 补水 was 02 taels, with the afternoon low at 698 taels.</p>

<p>The yarn market is considered平定, as exchange rates are difficult to松 and silver prices have fallen, raw materials cannot便宜. Yarn factories, due to the high昂 of costs, have changed纺细纱. The日厂s sold out the majority of their August-September orders early, so the large accounts做多have always been unwilling to松. The空方, because of the减少of sales, have tended to 抛空. Furthermore, with the United States cotton situation not good, they are consistently bearish. It has been said that a merchant has directly运装 twenty-seven branches of Five Happiness and Shepherd brand directly to each Zhuangkou of 四处. Other factories have also 装出 2000 packages.

<p>Yesterday's overseas cotton market was 평澹 and without 神, but this city's cotton market was very firm. As gold prices trended涨, the 沪存底 goods were枯薄, each way source was凋零, so if it encountered the gold market's 上涨, the sell side immediately discovered that it was afraid of 虚, the city trend became even more firm. The changes of the future cannot be预料d.</p>

<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, various firms gradually sold their inventories as the weather cleared up and the end of the month approached, leading to further weakening. Both retailers and bulk buyers adopted a wait-and-see approach. Top-quality white rice was scarce, causing continued market weakness. High-quality rice remained around twelve yuan and a half, with thin but stable sales and sluggish market conditions. Yang Du Jian rice generally weakened, but top-quality rice was slightly stable. The trend toward Yuan-Yin rice continued, keeping prices at a low level. Recently, arrivals in Shanghai have decreased, boosting confidence. Prices fluctuated within a narrow range, with the opening price around twelve yuan.</p>
<p>South Shanghai: Yesterday, it was observed in the Hexia area that the market was sluggish on the 30th. The sluggish sales of white rice from various firms greatly impacted the market, making it difficult to recover. Although there were attempts to stabilize the market in the morning, prices soon declined. Currently, the rice market is facing abundant arrivals from the Yangtze River, poor conditions in the rice markets of producing areas, and large stockpiles in Shanghai, leading to stagnant transactions and weak market conditions. Arrivals of thin early rice from southern firms varied, and sales were slow. Prices have been further reduced, with Yang Du Jian rice and Yuan-Yin rice showing stagnant conditions.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Flour and Wheat Transactions in March <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Transactions Were Extremely Smooth... but Delivery Quantities Were Very Small</p>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, the total number of flour deliveries for March was only 11,000 bags of Red and Blue Car brands. This small quantity was truly beyond general expectations. Due to falling market prices, only a small number of deliveries took place. It can be seen that the decline was driven by the environment and did not match the actual situation. Most manufacturers gradually withdrew their goods through customer assistance or took them back themselves, resulting in no deliveries. The supply of actual goods is still low, and market prices may slightly increase in mid-April. However, futures trading was very active, almost doubling compared to previous months. The following table shows the details (in thousands of bags):</p>
<p>March: 2369 April: 2663</p>
<p>May: 4227 June: 4134</p>
<p>July: 4105 August: 5432</p>
<p>Wheat: The total number of wheat deliveries for March was only 36 truckloads, delivered by firms such as Taixun and Runde, and received by factories such as Shen Da and Hengfeng. It is said that the total amount of deliveries was over one million, mainly due to prior direct settlements between buyers and sellers.</p>

<p>The price of pig lead plummeted yesterday due to a sharp drop of over two pounds in the price of foreign lead. The arrival of Hunan lead in Shanghai further fueled panic throughout the city. Hankou-based Shanghai merchants rushed to sell, causing the standard price to plummet by forty to fifty cash. Currently, Hunan lead is estimated at fifteen taels and three and a half cash, while foreign lead is at sixteen taels and three cash. Transactions were limited to minor purchases by local factories, with virtually no interest from other customers. According to insiders, the sales of pig lead have been very slow recently, and arrivals from various sources continue unabated, maintaining a state of fear. Therefore, there is concern that the trend will continue to weaken in the coming days.</p>

<p>The price of land in Xiamen for tangerine peels has recently risen by half a yuan, making it difficult to match Shanghai prices. As a result, arrivals have been cut off recently. Shanghai's market has already been opened, so the market price is bound to rise. Locally produced peels are of high quality, with a bright red color and dryness. However, the output is small, and there are concerns about insufficient supply. The current market price is twenty taels.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market received a telegram from the producing areas. There were no changes in the price of Cuban and Javanese spot and forward sugars. The price of New York futures sugar fell by two cents in May, and three cents each in September and December. The Association's price for Dutch No. 24 coarse granulated sugar was firm due to the rise in foreign exchange rates. The asking price was initially ten taels and two cash, but trading was slow. Later, transactions occurred at ten taels and one and a half cash, with the market shape being generally flat. No. 20 medium granulated white sugar was quoted at nine taels and seven cash, but there were few inquiries. Japanese sugar YP brand was at nine taels and nine cash and two and a half cents, YRO brand was at nine taels and five cash, YT brand was at ten taels and one cash, Z brand was at ten taels and two and a half cents, and TK brand was at ten taels. Transactions were also slow, and the overall trend was stable.</p>

<p>Locally Made Cloth: The rising trend in the market has intensified, and the sales of fine cloth were even smoother yesterday. Factories are again having difficulty with warehouse receipts for spot goods, as demand exceeds supply. Trumpet brand thin cloth is selling for seven taels and five and a half cash, Blue Double Fish for seven taels and six cash and two and a half cents, Colored Clouds for seven taels and five cash and seven and a half cents, and fine twill has also risen accordingly. Yang Crane is selling for seven taels and four cash and seven and a half cents, Blue Double Fish for seven taels and two cash and seven and a half cents, and eleven-pound coarse cloth from Tianjin has resumed movement. Yesterday, 100 pieces of Three Deer were sold at five taels and four cash, and Human Clock at five taels and three cash. Nine-pound cloth was slightly sluggish due to purchases by the Wenzhou and Taizhou merchants, and the price slightly fell. Yesterday, Five Blessings Cat Eagle brand was quoted at four taels and eight cash, and sixteen-pound cloth remained strong.</p>
<p>Eastern and Western Piece Goods: Yesterday's market was boosted by rising gold prices, which increased confidence. Prices of Eastern goods such as direct tribute woolen cloth, direct tribute satin, and fine broadcloth all rose. Zhongshan woolen cloth was even stronger. Banana Leaf Title Book brand was at two cash, eight cents, and seven and a half mils, exchanged for Crown Prince at two cash and eight cents. There were many purchases of official goods. Cotton velour also rose. Liang Wudi brand bright red and concubine colors were both at two cash and one cent. However, plain white had reached two cash and four cents, and Thick Peony brand white muslin was at three cash and three cents. This stable high price is rare. Wool silk cloth is in high demand from the Yangtze River region. Three Horse Head brand was at two taels, eight cash, and two and a half cents, and Three Joint brand was at two taels and seven cash. Flowers Straight Tribute Woolen Cloth from the Hankou region has moved. The Sleeping Dragon Ridge Seven Sons Picture brand is needed at three cash and six and a half cents. Western goods such as plain Western velvet are gradually moving. Taihe Yan Nian brand plain white is at sixteen taels, and Yi Ji brand Three Autumn is at nineteen taels.</p>
<h3 id="e203">Melville Sales Are Sluggish <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>Due to Too High a Selling Price</p>
<p>Melville, specializing in the sale of Western clothing, has qualities known as Hun Tian, Liang Tian, and San Tian, with San Tian being the thickest and most popular. Sales have suddenly become extremely sluggish this spring, reportedly due to the high selling price. Yesterday, Gong Ping, Rong Tai, Zhen Zhi, and TTT Melville sold for three taels and two cash and five cents, while other miscellaneous brands of Chong San Tian sold for only two taels and six or seven cash. The width of Melville is only thirty-two inches. Compared to French flannel, it is extremely uneconomical, as top-quality all-wool French flannel is fifty-eight inches wide and sells for only five taels per yard, while the quality is softer and thicker than Melville. As a result, Melville sales are becoming increasingly sluggish.</p>

<h3 id="e205">Theft <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Guangmei</p>
<p>The affair—theft—although as mundane as eating when hungry and drinking when thirsty, is certainly not as easily encountered in anyone's life history. What is called mundane, needless to say, refers to the entirety of humanity rather than individuals. Of course, there is a segment of people who, due to their lives and circumstances, frequently get to taste it, and naturally, it is nothing to be surprised about for them. However, those who are trying it for the first time cannot avoid adding a few words for the record. At the same time, they feel that although the principles of theft are consistent, the circumstances and methods are not something that can be encompassed in a single statement. Moreover, they have believed throughout the entire theft incident that they were living in a dream world. If they do not take advantage of today's extraordinary impression to leave some traces, they are afraid that it will end up being an unending dream.</p>
<p>The affectionate quilt was still tightly embracing them, each dreaming the beautiful dreams of youthful girls. The lark did not dare to call loudly, fearing to wake them up. The sun had also thoughtfully kept the fact that there were no classes these days in mind, specially hiding its golden face deep in the clouds, so as not to let it shine directly through the window screen onto the dressing table, and then reflected by the mirror directly to their charming faces, disturbing their sleep. At the same time, it did not dare to kiss them lightly, fearing that the lover in their dreams would secretly present them with a silent gun. The alarm clock quietly passed the room while they were still in their dreams. The air was still as quiet as deep night.</p>
<p>"Oh no, the thief has been here, miss..." The nanny cried as she rushed into their room, lifting the bedding to check whether their boxes had been stolen. But her voice was already trembling severely, and her expression was extremely flustered.</p>
<p>In this way, the affection of the quilt, the lark's modesty, and the sun's thoughtfulness were all wasted.</p>
<p>"What, what..." They opened their sleepy eyes as if startled, tilting their short, messy hair. Hearing the nanny crying outside, responding "the thief...", it frightened them.</p>
<p>Then, they saw the fur coat in front of the bed and the coats piled up on the back of the door, declaring their departure.</p>
<p>"We were..." Before they could shout, the nanny cried again, "Also, letters and seals are in the funnel, I don't know whose miss's are..."</p>
<p>"It's mine, and there are things and money too!" Mei heard the seal and letters and knew it was hers, and shouted anxiously, "They are useful things!" Her voice was already trembling with sobs.</p>
<p>"I also have money! The pen should be in there too..."</p>
<p>"All my clothes are gone..."</p>
<p>Ji and Zhi also cried out at the same time. Little Ya, seeing this situation, followed crying. The nanny cried in fear, and the classmates inquired with concern and surprise. Another group of classmates checked their own clothes to see if they had been stolen. And a part of the people were chattering and studying the truth of the theft. "Where did the thief come in from and where did they go out from? It's still snowing, how did they know to only steal from number nine..." For a time, discussions were diverse, crying was noisy. There was the triviality of housewives haggling prices in the small market, the urgency of firefighters rescuing fires in the fire scene, and the lamentations of the stolen. The chaotic air filled the entire girls' dormitory. The place, which was once jokingly called "Palace" by a group of male students, suddenly formed the Hongkou vegetable market.</p>
<p>Other rooms were not involved, only in number nine were found coats, fur coats, silver dollars and other items missing, totaling more than four hundred yuan. The owners were Zhi, Ji and Mei.</p>
<p>Although it was rainy and snowy, the heavens were not beautiful, it was not a problem in Shanghai. They had previously agreed to take advantage of this period without classes to have fun as much as possible, but only limited to the movies. Also, they had been invited early to eat the old calendar New Year's Eve dinner, euphemistically called a gathering. Now, all plans have failed.</p>
<p>Since being stolen from, they have had to stay in their room, unable to go out without clothes.</p>
<p>Strangely, the four coats and other clothes on the back of the door disappeared, and the clothes rack had been replaced with summer clothes. Their own fur coats had turned into velvet-lined coats, and they still had to feel the shivers from time to time. But they still did not believe that their clothes had really been stolen. They were completely like they were dreaming.</p>
<p>Their depression and annoyance, although not a big deal, had other reasons. Ji was originally ill and had not eaten anything for nearly a week. With the added cold, it became more severe. Zhi's fur coat had only been made for six days before it was stolen. She had originally planned to go home for her grandmother's eightieth birthday, but how could she go back now? Her heart was as anxious as a sword. She imagined how much her family was looking forward to her going back, how busy her grandmother's birthday would be. Looking at the current situation, she could only resentfully feel lost. Mei, due to special circumstances, was constantly concerned about her kind mother. Although they had different illnesses, they sympathized with each other.</p>
<p>This was still the first phenomenon. They had changed their usual carefree smiles and noisy attitude. Their liveliness had also disappeared into their sorrow. That clear singing voice could no longer be found in their room. Xiao and the flute could also take advantage of this rare opportunity to rest greatly. Their number nine room, which had always been full of youthful sunshine, had now become a gray, depressed world. The city of sorrow and the sick country had buried them alive.</p>

<p>— Bing She</p>
<p>In recent years, the Jiangwan area will form a school district. In addition to the many schools in Jiangwan, the Faculties of Law, Chi Chih, and Ai Kuo are already standing in a tripartite manner on Jiangwan Road. Recently, each school has experienced theft, and not just once. The local public security bureau has long been troubled by this and feels that the public security is not as quiet. Those responsible for maintaining it were perhaps negligent. The bureau officials were quite clear about the righteousness, so they took this as their fault and shame and decided to solve the case in order to find out about other past theft cases. On the school side, thefts in male and female dormitories were indeed not less than several times.</p>
<p>Since reporting to the Public Security Bureau, the bureau's investigation team has come to inspect the victims' rooms three or four times. Number nine was probably examined as a route for the thief to enter and exit. They felt strange and peculiar. The word "strange" existed in their minds at all times, and even newspaper reporters picked it up and a message was sent by the news agency. They inadvertently discovered the news of their theft in major newspapers, not to mention the tabloids.</p>
<p>Okay, their work came. Although it was relatively troublesome, they could gain considerable comfort and relief from this trouble. During this period, they would always receive several letters of condolence from local or out-of-town.</p>
