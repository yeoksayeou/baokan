<p>時評</p>
<h3>世界經濟種種</h3>
<p>其一日本大藏省調查。日美英法德五國貿易之衰退率。輸出以日本之退減百分之三一五爲最高美國之百分之二六六次之。英次之法又次之德又次之。輸入以美國之百分之三零四爲最高。日本之。德次之。英又次之。法又次之。據此以觀。其率雖有高下。無論輸入輸出。其退減則。一貿易之不振。於此可見。</p>
<p>其二。英國財政部說帖。除戰事恩俸外國家所負社會事業之經費。自一九一○年。至一九三○年。已由二千八百萬鎊。增至一萬五千八百萬鎊。僅就失業保險而言。一九三一年。比一九二八年時。已增多四千五百萬鎊。是英國失業入數之日益增多不言可喻。而該說帖又云。一九三一年之稅收勢必減少則預料今後經濟界之不振。一時不能恢復。又在言外矣。</p>
<p>其三美國華盛頓州議會。通過請願國會之挽救銀市議案。請願書。中請國會注意目下全世界銀價之日向下趨急宜召集國際大會。共商挽救。因中國與東方數國。爲銀價下賤購買力驟爲减小。致全世界經濟之凋敝。益形增劇也。是對於世界經濟之恐慌而注意。已達於極度矣。</p>

<h3>華虚明博士明日抵滬</h3>
<p>▲文納特卡制之特點</p>
<p>美國敎育家華虚朋博士（Dr·Cbaleton　W·Washburne）將於本月十三日來華講演、關於博士之生平國内知者頗鮮、按博士爲研究個别敎育家、所謂「文納特卡（Winnetka）制」之創造者、出身於斯丹福大學、從事小學敎育有年、對於學校班級制深用懷疑、立志研究個别敎學、最初着手試行屢受敎育當局之反對、至一九一九年、博士始應芝加哥附近文納特卡鎭小學校之聘、爲大規模之個别敎育實騐、兹將其特點略述於下、</p>
<p>一、文納特卡制包含四個重要原則、（一）使兒童能盡量獲得將來生活上應用之知識及技能、（二）每一兒童能自然的快樂的完美的享受兒童生活、（三）人類之進步、在各份子能充分的發展、（四）人羣之福利、須在各份子中有整個的社會意譯之發展、</p>
<p>二、文納特卡制之課程包括兩部份、（一）一部份課包括足以養成兒童社會化態度之知識與技能、（二）一部份課程包括足以養成兒童努力於創造工作之刺激與環境、</p>
<p>三、文納特卡制所施之個别敎學、包括三個特殊的進程、（一）課程之目標、按社會之需要而定、並參照兒童在各時期發展之能力而組織、（二）敎材之編制、能使兒童自行學習、自行改正錯誤、（三）文納特卡制創造者華虚明爵士之像</p>
<p>編製診斷式的測騐、能適合各階段學習的應用、四、文納特卡制完全打破班級敎學、在文納特卡學校、無年級之區分、某一兒童須坐在某敎室、悉依社會年齡而區分、所謂「社會年齡」即指其在敎室中最能與其他兒童相聯合而言、</p>
<p>五、文納特卡制、特别注重團體的與　造　　動、活動中心、多集中在社會科學或文學方面、其目的在刺激兒童得發現其個性、啟發其本能與創造力、養成其服務心、及對於羣衆福利之意識、以救濟個性敎育之畸形的發展、</p>
<p>六、文納特卡學校課室中、旣無背誦、亦少講解、以診斷式的測騐代替背誦、他方面更有團體的與創造的活動、又因編有兒童自習敎材、故需要敎師之講解者甚少、</p>
<p>關於文納特卡之詳情、聞我國專門研究兒童敎育之團體兒童敎育社、將在機關雜誌一兒童敎育」出版一文納特卡專號、不日即由開明書店發行、</p>

<p>▲各隊最後成績</p>

<h3>▲麥令大功告成</h3>
<p>丨華東功虧一簣丨</p>
<p>裁判員白勃脫宣令開戰、華東重兵出征、陸鍾恩斜道出關陳　龍騰空越海、二球中的聲勢倍盛、顧指之間麥令二罰一中、立成和數、華東五虎車輪大戰　陳·黎·汪·陸·歐陽等互顯身手、各中一軍、成十四比四之超峯、忽而全局形勢、趨向平淡、久而久之、麥令得勢、速下敵壘、推以對方防守嚴密、所得有限、上半時華東以十六對十二占先、再戰聲中、活石皮忽得陸之傳球乘勢侵入、一舉而下、陸施巧計、又占先著、迨後畢雪濃沙台先後奏功、打成十八和局、不久又成二十一與二十三和數、過後、麥令進迫、華東追隨、又成二十七和數、末來麥令勃郎一球、竟以二十九比二十七後來居上、可謂僥倖之至、</p>
<p>▲青光海盜得利</p>

<p>海盜表演甚佳、進攻退守、無睱可擊也是屈居人下、倍受困阨上半時海盜二十九也是十四、下半時、海盜縱横如意、分數大增、也是朿手待斃一籌莫展、迨至海盜四十五分時、方見康約法打中一球否則下半時將以鴨蛋告終也比賽結果海盜以四十八比十六得勝、二　裁判員均係貝立新擔任、</p>

<h3>張輝瓚氏之果斷　楊花</h3>
<p>赤氛邊及。苦無孑遺。如湘如卾如贛。其尤其者也。國軍第十八師師長張輝瓚氏。於東固一役。竟以身殉。張爲湘籍名將。該省參與黨國諸役。張皆身與。護國之役。張任湘中游擊司令。援卾之役。張任旅長兼江防司令。討賊之役。張任師長。洎至建國軍之北伐革命軍之北伐。張皆偏領師干。馳驅沙塲。所各披靡。而西征一役。張尤以算定稱。蓋其時張任二軍副軍長。所部駐宜昌。軍長爲魯滌平。常駐南京。時中央正對唐生智用兵。即所謂「西征」也。二軍爲中央部隊。唐乃令吳尚李品仙何鍵以三軍之衆。合謀二軍。俾免後慮。張　知其謀。遂召所部將領會議。僉以孤軍無援。不若由宜昌退湘西。以待中央軍軍事勝利。再圖策應。張力排衆議。堅持直出武漢。期速解决唐部。遂分遣使者西說楊森。餌以宜昌稅收。北勸方振武。（方時駐襄陽）勗以戮力黨國。果也偏師朝出。唐部宵解矣。</p>
<p>張氏在湖南。無論婦孺。皆知其名。蓋張氏於援卾一役受挫後。解除軍職。轉任湖南省會警察廳長。時長沙有婦人名劉麻子者。專以引誘良家婦女暗地賣淫爲事。湘人名爲台基業。亦曰調台。主其事者則名之曰提調。劉麻子則爲長沙唯一之大提調。時趙恒惕主湘政。以宴游爲時尚。文職若廳長秘書。武職若師長旅長。無不以一登劉麻子之門爲榮。故劉麻子一時勢燄熏天。良家婦女受其蠱惑者不知凡幾。即各達者顯者之姨太太小姐輩。亦多有認劉麻子爲乾媽供劉麻子之調遣者。張就任之始。即欲得劉麻子而置之法。顧以所稔者多。騎緹未返。保狀已至。乃先令司文牘者秘書就罪狀。親率弁兵躬往劉麻子所居將劉逮捕。逕赴刑塲斬决蓋若從事訊問。則保者已紛至沓來矣。自此以後。張輝瓚之名。遂震聞全湘。長沙人至今引爲談料焉。</p>

<p>會場在四川路青年會二樓。門口圍以松柏。中嵌「朱成章先生追悼會」八字。朱君皈依耶敎。故所定禮節。與尋常不同。有祈禱讀經。祝福等項。予二時前往。見台右並坐遺孤四。均穿灰布長袍。白帽白鞋。臂繞黑紗。台上供朱君半身西裝遺像。奕奕有神。上懸「精神終古榘範長存」横額。旁有宋子文王正廷兩部長所贈。「一炬竟焚卞和玉。九霄驚隕少微星。」與「但傷麟角遭摧折。莫與鴻毛論重輕」之輓聯。因耶敎關係。僅以松柏鮮花。堆積如山。不設祭台。台口置盆花二十。花圈七。圈内均嵌十字形。四壁遍掛祭幛輓聯。孔祥熙主席。報告開會宗旨時。謂人必死。祇要問死者生前做人如何。朱君所做事業。可以對上帝。對國家。對社會。均無愧。繼全體唱哀歌。唱畢。西人費吳生與湯承熙登台。舉行祈禱。中西語並用。旋由余日章讀新約全書。哥林多前書十五章第三十七節一段。獻花時。孔庸之楊敦甫張嘉甫鄺富灼林康侯五君。皆手持花圈。魚貫而至遺像前行一鞠躬禮。演講秩序單上。規定張市長等六人。註明每位限五分鐘。但結果張市長代表俞鴻鈞講六分鐘。陳光甫講九分鐘。劉王立明講六分鐘。王儒堂代表余日章講十一分鐘。鮑乃德（西人）講八分鐘。黄任之講二十分鐘。莫不逾限。陳光甫與朱君關係最深。故演講時悲痛異常。渠所贈之輓聯。亦最沉痛。文曰「老父八旬餘。子幼妻羸。痛慘遭狙擊。遽棄塵寰。撒手應知瞑目。」「同舟十五載。推心置腹。悵遠客燕山。竟成永訣。臨喪未免太傷神。」劉王立明極言朱君生前善侍其妻。爲看護夫而兼領子女。謂當此借戀愛自由四字而破壞家庭制之時所不可多得。黄任之對於朱君遇難後。主對仇人不報復之語。大加稱許。繼由上海雅樂社唱特别哀歌。七男七女同時合唱。用英語。未悉意義。祇覺如訴如泣。甚爲悲慘耳。未，上修中誠牧師高舉兩手。舉行祝福而散會。</p>
<h3>葉譽虎致楊小樓書</h3>
<p>小樓先生。聞大駕來滬。因抱病多日。不得一聆雅奏。憾甚。往在北平。雖恒相見。而未及深談。僕於戲劇本無所知。以性躭文藝。故對此亦頗具興趣。竊謂我國戲劇今日宜亟有以保全其眞相與特色。方可進言改良。否則眞相先失。何從知其得失。近年各劇家爲趨時起見。已大半失其故步。而先輩凋零漸盡。後生能繼起者稀。斯尤此道之厄。執事藝術超越儕輩。今無其敵。以隨波逐流之上海。對執事具眞賞者尚不乏人。足知實至然後名歸。此中尚有公理。惟鄙人所亟欲奉告者。則執事應自覺爲吾國戲劇界之一特材。爲吾國戲劇界計。應負使自已絶藝流傳於後之責。今尊年已過五十。體力有漸衰之傾向。不知高徒内有無足以繼起之人。竊謂執事宜格外留意。選擇質美可敎者。盡力陶鑄。使窺藴奥。庶絶藝不至無傳。而盛名亦與之俱永。此較之以財産遺子孫爲遠勝。病中所見。率臆直陳。惟鑒昭不宣</p>

<h3>宜興徐家村之怪物　蔣柏泉</h3>
<p>宜興縣和橋鎭之西南五六里。有村曰徐家村。村後半里許。有大池塘一。周圍百數十步。塘可與外河相通。然僅一小狹漕之連接。塘上植荆　。備作燃料之資。鄉民之赴市漕者必經其旁焉。</p>
<p>半年來乃盛傳塘中忽來一怪物。鄉民之赴市或由市歸者。遂相率而行於阡陌之間。遠避之。人言鑿鑿。數日間即傳遍於鄉民。因是觀奇者踵接於道。余之戚友數人亦往觀焉。然是怪究爲何物。觀者雖衆。莫之名也。</p>
<p>據附近之居民云。塘上有大穴。直徑可尺餘。塘旁與水相接處。亦有相等之大穴一。初。每晚遠見巨燈一盞於塘上。光發紅色。近視之。燈光轉小。直趨而觀之。光小似螢火。由洞口出。由足漸疑懼。繼默察之。如是者數日夜。一日晨間。太陽將由東山上。鄉民數人徘徊於塘旁。以觀究竟。忽有黑色之圓頂一。出現於塘中。與水面幾相平接。漸久。圓頂漸大。鄉民駭而奔。未幾。再顧之。則黑色之圓頂已擴展於半池。質之往觀者。所見亦相同。據謂此物出現時。常在晨間與飯後。而尤須於天氣晴朗之日。若人聲嘈雜。則不之見也。</p>
<p>怪物之嘴略尖。有人因謂之爲龍馬。惟怪物之頭如何。眼如何。軀體如何。因觀者膽怯。不敢近池旁。且若相約鼓勇而前。則怪物又沉没而不可見。故是怪究爲何物。至今莫能名也。</p>
<p>以余測之。是必爲多年之動物無疑。天下安有所謂怪物者。望生物學家往察究竟。釋鄉民之愚。且携歸陳之於博物館。供世人之研究焉。（未蓋章）</p>
<h3>齒石　康安</h3>
<p>齒石。並非石如齒形。而是石有齒痕。質細而堅。異常秀麗。土人名之曰齒石。</p>
<p>齒石産於湖南益陽西鄉之浮邱山。浮邱山爲益陽第二高山。上有古廟。住和尚數人。滿山皆大小石塊。均有齒痕。或多或少。或美或陋。齒痕縱横交錯。有淺有深。齒數有多有少。齒片有闊有窄。土人謂爲鼠或他獸所嚙。古時是否有咬石塊之動物。殊難斷定。和尚謂古有仙人聚居此山。日不舉火。惟啖石以充飢。兩說如何。惟有質諸地質學家耳。</p>
<p>此種齒石。自該山附近梅林高級小學開辦後。往拾取者日衆。以其秀麗。琢爲硯盤墨水缸或其他裝飾品。殊美觀也。後由某君介紹。陳列於長沙勸工塲。求重價估之鑒賞者竟不惜重價。數十件竟於一星期内售罄雕刻者獲重利焉。</p>
<p>現今該山齒石雖多。甚少美者。該廟中和尚或收藏數件。不知地下尚有埋存否也。</p>
<h3>寒之損失　陳伯英</h3>
<p>去年天氣之嚴寒。僅得華氏表十餘度。不獨數年來所未有。抑亦爲光緒以後所希逢也。乃有人因之損失萬金。誌之以供談助。有蔡子璜者。安亭人。曾爲省議員。家道小康。精鑒别。喜收藏。去秋在首都莫姓家。購得董其昌書屏一堂。及金剛經墨迹一册。又明人繪耕織圖一幅。又痰盂一只。價二百元而不足。携歸審視。則書畫固非贋。利已十倍。而痰盂竟爲宋窰。宋窰時價無萬金以内者。若稍一居奇。則五萬唾手可得。乃大喜。欲什襲藏之。將陳諸廳事。恐召覬觎。置於低處。恐小兒婢僕不謹而蹴之。庋之高處。又恐狸奴鼠之過而觸之。躊躇良久。恍然又增祝融之慮。窮思終日。方得一法。市巨缸二。置痰盂其中。實土滿之。自以爲計出萬全矣。時骨董商得訊。紛紛求讓。蔡曰。此希世物。不能割愛。但爲諸君擴眼界則可。於是骨董商詣其居請觀。蔡啓缸出土。則盂碎一角。蓋天寒水冰。土亦沍結所致。磁器以完好爲第一義。若缺裂即無所貴矣。蔡乃抱盂而泣。七日後猶爲太息。其盂如現在所用狀。色黑如漆。煜煜作奇光。中段鼓起處。有海棠花四朶周之。花白色如玉。粹然而温。花心又作山水。設色紅如鷄冠。碧如翡翠。鮮明欲滴。友人顧君親見之。或曰。其名爲甄。</p>

<h3>棉市始跌終漲</h3>
<p>棉市始跌繼漲、但海外棉市轉漲、匯兌稍有回鬆、故有一部份傾向抛空、然日商態度强硬、拉力甚緊、附和者亦屬不少、因外棉不能進口、原棉不敷供給、故一跌買户即蜂擁而來、賣方均似驚弓之鳥、敵力甚衰、總之世界上尚未到棉荒時代、匯兌如能鬆落、外棉就能輸進、前途須依匯兌爲轉移耳、</p>

<h3>糧食　河下米市步堅</h3>
<p>▲閘北　昨日裡路來源寥寥、緣本埠將停斛、内地貨商故不再裝來滬故少數賣户尚抱扳售、然河中存積仍旺買客方欲放盤、因此市形祗略步堅而已、北粳高貨仍少、大盤悉好一角、形勢頗秀、薄稻到銷兩淡、市無上落、羊秈到貨不多、而棧廠貨主居奇抬售、行情續升角左、特頂須十二元二角、杜尖埠尖情况堅穩、交易平常、變元陰化産訊殊佳、然此間買氣不振、斛數寥落、故勉守原盤、</p>

<p>書報介紹</p>
<h3>矛盾　湯彬</h3>
<p>民族主義文藝運動、在中國文壇上已成爲有力底主潮、這是誰也不能否認的事、屬於民族主義的創作小說、突現於我們眼前的雖然不多、但是大都爲不多得的力作、决不像普羅作家在那裏大量地生産所謂淺薄的普羅作品、使我們讀了、祗感到它底粗暴有如口號標語一般、一點也没有什麽藝術價值可言、置諸文學的本質而不顧、所以、這類淺薄粗暴的作品、是不能具有文學的永久性、在不久之前、就没落了、民族主義文藝理論、已底定鞏固的基礎、這是極形顯明的事實、因爲它在理論上已有　　的基礎、　　民族主義文藝運動特現於中國文壇僅有很短的時期、它底創作已有這樣的成熟、雖然不能說是達到藝術的最高峯、但比諸一些淺薄粗暴的普羅作品的技術却有異樣的進展、具有相當欣賞力的讀者、大概可以瞭然的吧、</p>
<p>前鋒月刋是民族主義文藝最有力的一種定期刋期、現在已出版三期、每期的内容都極豐富、除發表多量理論文字、批評文字之外、對於民族主義文藝創作是尤爲傾重、在數量上雖然不是怎樣的洋洋大觀、在質量上却使我們企羨、因爲、每一篇都是作者精心之作、足見編者選擇創作之嚴格一斑了、</p>
<p>在這裏、技術方面最熟練的、我們要推李贊華的作品了、這期所刋的一篇「矛盾　」實是國内創作界罕見之作、在形式上、决不是普羅作品那樣的粗暴、在文字上更不是那樣的淺薄、但是它却含有民族　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　以看出民族主義文藝創作的偉大來、</p>
<p>這篇「矛盾」故事的内容是很簡單的、寫一個外人辦公室裏的職員燕樵、爲了秘密結會、被那猪也似的監督者責問、青年人的性情、本來是崛强的、但是爲了生活問題又不能不屈服於洋人爪牙之下、作者在這裏、是要表現出現世界裏處處都是矛盾着在、有了這種不能解脫的矛盾、才能使人感到革命的需要、這是很顯明的事實、</p>
<p>作者的文筆很熟練、在每一字句的組織裏、都可以看出他經過推敲的工夫、所以、隨時隨地使我們看了感到作者所寫的是含有矛盾的意志、這是非有充分文學上修養的人所不能做到的、在這文的起始、作者就這樣有力的表現着、</p>
<p>辦公室裏的空氣永遠是這樣呆板、這樣濃厚、彷彿是凝滯住的霧塊、這霧塊、似與外間隔成了兩個世界　　　　　　　　　是那樣猛烈他奔來、迅捷地退去、……</p>
<p>這樣的字句是多麽的熟練、這樣的含意又是多麽深沉、讀者看了總能明白的、我以爲、决不是一般平凡的創作所能表現得如此有力的、在普罷作品裏、更其是望塵莫及的了、</p>
<p>接着、是寫猪也似的人是那麽莊嚴、對於下級職員如燕樵等是用一種沉重的態度、當他蹣跚地走到辦公室裏來、把一件件的薄記翻着看、有的立刻便簽上字、但有的却使他縐着眉、隨手抛在一邊、在這時候、職員們頓時便免不了有一陣惶急與不安、忐忑着的心、感到他的臉色是那麽沉重、自已竟是這樣的渺小、在此、我們就可以明白一個人的心理都有矛盾的現象浮沉着、同時、現世界裏無論那裏都在矛盾着呢、這猪也是的人、把燕樵喚到自已房間裏來責問、在這裏、燕樵是平地的走進想望中的世界了、</p>
<p>燕樵在想望中的世界裏、感到拘謹、不自然、身子不知放到什麽地方好、那白白、胖胖的、猪也似的人、指點面前的椅子給他坐、他曲着腰、才坐下、明白這世界是屬於别人的、作者這樣的表現、是多麽有力而輕快、使我們看了能夠感憤、怎樣不要起來爲我們中華民族而革命呢、同時、作者是灌輸、多量的向上的意識、這暗示力、是充滿了文學的因素、如果普羅作家來描寫、一定要變爲粗暴的呌喊、爲某個階級而宣傳什麽革命的主義了、</p>
<p>我們在洋大人支配之下混飯吃、當然没有自由可言、因此、使我們感到中華民族是受外來的壓迫異常嚴重、在這裏、作者是以很輕快的筆法表露下來了、例如丨</p>
<p>「自由嗎、你去自由好了、洋經理昨天要開除人、你怎不明白、」</p>
<p>開除了也好、滅絶着意志這樣地混下去、也不是路、他打算用這樣的話來回答、但置身在這另一世界裏、是消逝了那年青人的勇氣、</p>
<p>這、作者很明白的告訴我們在外人支配之下是不能得到自由的、但是、爲了種種的關係、是不敢加以反抗、同時也明瞭這是青年們的弱點、這在已經成爲矛盾的了、以後、作者所表現的是更爲有力、鼓勵着我們爲中華民族而奮鬭、</p>
<p>他想到自已本身是在革命怒潮中經過的青年、明知一朝闖進這樣的牢籠是很大的錯誤、兩年來使他的勇氣是消沉了許多、我爲什麽應該跳出我們的時代以外、我爲什麽能夠抛棄民族的生死不顧、度過這兩年慒　的生活呢、望着那勇氣在生活的磨下逐漸化成粉、望着年青人的一切都歸於消失、這是自已能甘心的麽、</p>
<p>眞的、這是極有意義的話、如果青年人有這樣的反省、　們中華民族一定能在不久之前盛興志來、這是不可毁滅的事實、一最高的　望祗想做到那猪也似的人那一樣、須　　　對洋人笑、對本國人横着眼、一個　　　人、把希望寄託在這上面、實在是最　有出息、也太可憐了、」這是另一種藝術手腕的表現、同樣能使我們引起感憤、青年人、是應該振起精神來爲我們中華民族而努力奮鬭的、一種偉大的文藝作品、它一定具有起伏波紋、决不是平凡的描寫能表現出藝術的價值來、即使這樣、在讀者也須感到單調的意味、接着、作者就在正面來刻劃了、「他想到那猪也似的人、眼睛裏是要射出火、自已是忍受了他兩年的侮辱、在他的束縛下是失了整個的自由、猪也似的人敎他不要做個人、敎他去忍耐着甘心做奴隷、每月在他手裏取那三十六塊錢、彷彿把自已的一切都出賣了、然而、被他更轉賣給别人了、這種事實、在外人支配之下　事的　　以想　到的、但是不能活　地把這種情形表現下來、尤其是在文藝的作品裏、由此、我們可以看出作者描寫青年心理有　到高超之處翼他分析女子丨燕樵的妻丨的心理更爲迫眞而生動、因限於篇幅、祇有讓讀者自已去欣賞它的眞義了、</p>
<p>全篇結構、都異常緊凑、簡直没有一些枝節可以减削的、這就是作者善於剪裁的一點、在藝術上、這創作無疑地是已達到圓熟的一面、民族主義文藝創作、突現於中國文壇祇有很短的時期、就給予我們有如是偉大的成績、委實是難能可貴、與諸淺薄粗暴的普羅作品互相比擬、距離眞有天壤之别了、這是擺在我們眼前的事實、民族主義文藝作品不像所謂普羅作品那樣大量的生産、使它技巧的熟練也是一個最大的原因</p>

<h3>畢業前後　君平</h3>
<p>「哈哈、本學期可以結束了、」</p>
<p>彬手上拿了一張選課表、從敎務處跑回來、得意地說、</p>
<p>「怎麽、老米、寒假畢業了麽、」</p>
<p>「寫寫意、三年半畢業、便宜了一學期、」</p>
<p>彬臉上呈着笑容、兩隻脚動動地擊着地板、全身的筋脈都振動起來了、</p>
<p>本來、彬離開畢業的時候還有一年、因爲他還差了二十六個學分、依學校現在的規定、在一學期裏是祇可讀二十二個學分的、這次實出於彬自已意料之外、他向敎務長說了種種的苦衷以後、敎務長竟在他的選課表上寫了「特許」兩個字、於是彬的畢業年限、也就在敎務長的筆尖下縮短了半年了、</p>
<p>這在彬自已看來、實是一件幸事、</p>
<p>兩個月的光陰過去了、彬在校長佈告欄上看到畢業生試騐期間的佈告、於是他就將那篇做成一大半的畢業論文加緊工作、晚上電燈黑了後、再在瑩瑩的燭光下竪起筆尖在紙上劃、早上還是起得很早、洗完了臉、又靈續拿了那枝舊式的派克自來水筆來劃、</p>
<p>好容易把那篇畢業論文做成了、彬的臉上就時時現着笑容、好像畢業前的難關已經過了、前途是充滿着希望、彬想、畢業後的生活、是大有異於今日啊、</p>
<p>第二天早晨一起、彬披上了大衣、戴上帽子、就向一個照相館進發、到照相館後、彬換上一件學士衣、戴上學士帽、做起了十足的姿勢、叫店夥拍了幾張照片、這時、彬立在鏡前看看自已的面影、一種無名的愉快、頓時從心頭裏湧上來、</p>
<p>隔了幾天之後、照相館裏的學徒把照片送來了、彬取出來一看、覺得各方面都還可以、但是精神欠足一點、這只能說是美中不足、可不必去追求、於是他的臉上又浮起了一層可掬的笑容、</p>
<p>「應該先贈一張我最知已的朋友」、</p>
<p>彬坐在書桌前想、兩眼凝視手上的照片、臉上浮着兩個欲滴的笑渦、</p>
<p>「不、應先在裏面揀一張送給我的愛人、」彬繼續着想、</p>
<p>「老張、贈一張給你要不要、」彬的視線向着我閃、面上微微地呈了喜色、「那裏不要、米學士的照片、」</p>
<p>「哈哈、……………………」</p>
<p>彬聽到我稱他「米學士」、不由地笑了、</p>
<p>畢業試騐的日子到了、彬每天隨着鐘聲慢步地進敎室、在敎室裏也隨隨便便的作答、好像分數對他没有什麽關係似的、同時他的行動似乎也有些近於反常、臉上的笑渦也漸漸地不見了、</p>
<p>考試完畢後、彬的臉色和考試前又不同了、這時、彬的臉上祗是充滿了沉悶和煩惱、</p>
<p>也許彬已嘗到畢業的趣味了吧、在這人浮於事時候、畢業的出路問題眞不容易解决呢、你看、現在中國有多少失業的大學生、如果詳詳細細的把他調查起來、這個數目、眞要把我們嚇倒呢、</p>
<p>三個星期過去了、彬的生活問題還是没有解决、是的、飯是個個人都要吃的、這對於彬的前途、於他那副帶圓形的面龐上、自然又是添上一層悲苦的表情了、</p>
<p>一天下午、彬接到一張秘書處的通知單、說是校長呌他於明天上午到他家裏去談話、彬想、在一星期前自已曾有信寫給校長、這次呌他談話、或許與自已的出路問題有關、一忽兒他又想、校長在不久以前曾代好幾位畢業同學找出路、他們現在都已有事情做、是的、自已的出路問題也必會在這次談話的聲中解决了、　　彬把那張條子好好的摺起來放在皮袋、臉上微微地現着喜色、</p>
<p>第二天彬起得特别早、把面一洗、就跨出房門、向校長家裏進發了、</p>
<p>到了校長家裏、校長還没有起身、彬在客堂裏足足坐了兩點多鐘、才看到校長從房裏走出來、</p>
<p>「米彬麽、你來得很早、」校長說、</p>
<p>「秘書處的條子什麽時候到的、」校長繼續發問、</p>
<p>「昨天下午、」</p>
<p>「在現在的時候、找事情實非常困難、我替你寫了三四封介紹信、都没有結果、」</p>
<p>「…………」彬聽了剛才校長說的話、就像一盆冷水澆在他的身上一樣、心坎裏充滿了的一腔熱望完全消失了、」</p>
<p>「還是再請校長設法設法、」停了一會、彬用懇求的態度說、</p>
<p>「是的、我替你時時留意、」</p>
<p>談到這裏、彬就向校長告辭出來了、在馬路上踟蹰了一會、終於喊了一部黄包車回到校裏來、</p>
<p>在房裡、彬緊緊地閉着口、不作聲、「老米、談話的結果怎樣、」停了一會、我受了好奇心的壓迫向他發問、</p>
<p>「暫時不告訴你、」彬有點氣悶、不願答、</p>
<p>接着、房裡也就靜寂下來、</p>
<p>「像你們的生活眞有趣、天不管、地不管、」停了一會、彬一面走一面說、像有所思似的、</p>
<p>「那裡有趣、畢業才是有趣呢、」</p>
<p>「畢業有趣、是的、這是没有嘗過畢滋味的人說的話、」</p>
<p>「那麽、畢業是痛苦的麽、」</p>
<p>「至少是不快樂的、我覺得、尤其是大學畢業更覺痛苦、」</p>
<p>「那麽、在學期開始的時候、你又何必急急乎要畢業呢、</p>
<p>「那是我畢業前的幻想、那時候也和你現在一樣、以爲畢業是快樂的、」</p>
<p>…………………………………</p>
<p>彬和我辯了一會、終於他得到勝利了、</p>
<p>最後彬說、求學的目的是想爲社會服務、但是社會却不給我們服務的機會、所以畢業後祇有痛苦、其實、我也早已明白這個道理、但是我却不相信社會是絶對的不給我們服務的機會、</p>
<p>但是事實排在我們面前、社會確在拒絶一班剛從大學出來的學生、</p>
<p>彬畢業後已有兩個多月了、現在還是失業着、</p>
<h3>一對青年　曼引</h3>
<p>「你明天就走嗎、王」</p>
<p>「是的、明天離開此地、但是到京裏去還得後文、因爲李先生呌我到他家裏等兩天同他一道去、」</p>
<p>「那麽、後天我來北火車站送你、好不、」</p>
<p>「不客氣、省得麻煩、」</p>
<p>什麽客氣、這是應當的、我們流浪者除了不在彼此朋友問得點安慰什麽地方去找同情呢、」他這句話似乎引起王的感傷來、</p>
<p>「唉…」王嘆了一口長氣、</p>
<p>他自已則更深的墮入到别離的傷心的情景中、若有無限的煩愁、苦惱、梗塞在他的心頭、使他覺得難過、</p>
<p>房中有了一個暫時的靜默、</p>
<p>馬路上的車鈴聲、商店裏爲招引顧客而有的啦吧聲、金鼓聲、以及無數的市語聲、眞是雜　不堪、慢慢地經空氣的傳播、響澈了他們所居的室内了、</p>
<p>這時、王在低頭做他的工作、整束行裝、他呢、藉着爲王整理書籍的名義、走馬看花似的約略讀那些書的内容、然而他的内心、何曾注意到書中隻字呢、他聽着路上喧嚷的聲音、似咽唔、似泣訴、似哀呌、似呻吟、如波濤般起狀、他不禁生出絶大的厭惡之心來、</p>
<p>其實與其說是馬路上的喧嚷令人討厭、無甯說是這房内寂寞、無聊、而且充滿了愁惱、傷感成分的空氣令人窒息、令人難過還恰當些、因爲前者是活潑而有生氣、後者却是陰沉沉的、死一般的憂鬱着呵、</p>
<p>是的、死一般的憂鬱着、古人所謂生離死别、是最難堪的時候、他們此刻不正是生離的時候嗎、</p>
<p>他把手中正在整理的書籍往棹上一抛、霍地站起身來、氣憤地說、</p>
<p>「眞討厭、這些雜邃的聲音、」</p>
<p>他走到窗户前、惡狠地將那未關緊的窗門使勁的一推、意思是埋怨牠爲什麽不將馬路上喧嚷的聲音隔絶、而令傳到房内來侵襲人的心、然而這窗門却頑皮的因爲阻力的原故、反而張開了、於是「叮噹」「轟轟」一切馬路上的聲浪都爭先恐後敲着他的耳膜、而紅的、緑的、一切都市中的「色」也全透入他的眼簾、他便順勢地站在窗前張望、</p>
<p>天似乎同他的心情一樣的憂鬱着、太陽躱在雲的後面、一陣冷風迎面吹來、他感覺到空中在下着霏霏細雨了、俯視馬路上、則依舊紅的、緑的、一對對的、有如萬箭、蠕動着的電車、有如長蛇、飛跑着的汽車、有如奔虎、而這萬箭、長蛇、奔虎似乎聯合起來向他進攻、馬路上雜　的聲音就是進攻的號音、終於使着他的心痛、難過、</p>
<p>他呆一般的站立在窗前暝想着過去他是江省人、在江省某中學畢業後、便在一家報館裏作事、這職業是頗合乎他的興趣、因爲他歡喜文藝、想到在報社裏有充分的寫作機會、他不禁樂意了、在生活上、一個月有五十元大洋的進賬、也很彀開消、然而他終於將這筆好差事辭却不幹了、這裏不能不怪他脾氣不好、或者說「不識時務」了、原來他是個青年、有血性的青年、看不慣報館裏職員們擺官僚架子、討厭那些迎流合汚的編輯先生作的時評、社論一類的文章、他覺得這環境於他是不宜的、因爲你想長此幹下去、非得同他們鬼混不可、什麽打牌、請客、挾妓…都是現代官塲中少不了的應酬、</p>
<p>丨這是怎麽行、假使學會了這些把戲、那還成爲一個青年嗎、而且、我的前途、就甘願埋葬在這樣齷齷的環境中嗎、</p>
<p>丨不、不、我要離開此地、離開這生活雖然很優裕、而環境却很糟糕的、記者、生涯、爲丁我的事業、爲了我的前途、</p>
<p>丨走、到海埠去、丨</p>
<p>他自進報館裏作事以來、感覺自已學識不彀、有再求學之必要、一貧如洗的家庭不能供給他的學費、他常想到海埠去半工半讀、而且他知道海埠是近代文化的發祥地薈萃着許多文人、學者、他夢想在那樣一個文化水準很高的環境中、必能得到他所要得的學識、能力、經騐、他也曾顧慮到生活問題、可是他以爲那不算什麽、海埠工廠很多、只要能吃耐勞、找不到相當的事情作、就到工廠裏做工、他確信一個青年、一個純潔忠實而有遠志的青年、决不會爲社會所擯棄、「不能賣腦力、就賣體力、」他常常這樣說、</p>
<p>於是他來海埠了、</p>
<p>在江埠動身之前、他還回到離江埠三百里路遠的故鄉一镒、告别他的老父母、說他們的兒子將有遠行、</p>
<p>「海埠有朋友爲你謀得好的位置、是不是、」常常囑咐挣錢養家的五十多歲的父親問、因爲他讀書、至今家中還欠有幾百塊錢的債呢、</p>
<p>「是的、父、海埠有朋友寫信呌有去、」他撒謊騙他的父親、</p>
<p>「依我看、頂好是不要去、兒、海埠太遠了、年歲又不好、倒不如在本省就報館裏事幹着、地方近些、人也混熟了、等日後慢慢地謀發達好些、」他的慈母說、</p>
<p>「你們婦女不曉得什魔、」父親說、「男兒志在四方、天下爲家、只要海埠有朋友呌他去、怎麽不去、光守本地幹什麽、」雙親雖是這樣互相勸慰着、然而等到與兒分手的時候、他說一聲、「爺、媽、我去了、」</p>
<p>「好、你去、路上放過細些、」是他父親戰顫的喉音、</p>
<p>「不要忘記了家、兒、到了就寫信回來、免得爲娘的掛念、」他母親流出眼涙來、</p>
<p>他深深地領略到父母愛子之心、眞不可以用言語來形容、</p>
<p>廿世紀交通發達、三千餘里路程、坐輪船只三天、他就從江埠來海埠了、初到海埠時他頗驚喜、一個從農村出來的幼稚兒、突然混入這東方第二巴黎的海埠、那偉大的兵艦、高矗的洋房、寛敞的馬路、繁華的街市、還有那花枝招展的美人、他不禁散了一口在江埠久積鬱的悶氣、儘量地向這大都市的懷抱裏去找尋他生命的泉源、追求他至終的歸宿、他要努力、他要前進、他要抖起精神、大踏步向人生道上走…</p>
<p>……時光一溜地三個月過去了、他努力前進走的結果呢、除了失望、研璧、所得的不過是侮辱、奚落、窮困、凍餓……起首他去應徵報紙上招請職員的廣告、被拒絶、他想賣文寫稿、不是給編輯先生們不睬、便是「本刋停辦、尊稿奉還、」最後他到工廠找工做、却硬給工廠辦事員指爲有工人運動者嫌疑「社會對待一個青年、該是這樣殘酷麽、」他常常嘆息痛恨着、墮入到失望的深淵裏而悲哀哭泣更是常事、他的腦經原是有點神經質的、至是則失了組織、自制的能力、時而哭、時而笑、惹起二房東的女孩取笑他、說是「瘋子、」當然、他再不能用心思看書而努力寫作了、整日裏只蜷伏在一小亭子間裏睡覺、心血一潮、就往馬路上跑、一天、兩天、一禮拜、……就這樣過去、他的身體本來不很强健、近來因爲飮食失調、說不好聽點、就是餓飯、弄得瘦弱不堪了、如今他才了解海埠一切的繁華、熱閙、於一個窮苦陌生的流浪者是没有絲毫好處、除了令你氣憤、痛恨、詛咒、以致於悲哀哭泣、……</p>
<p>如果勉强要他說來海埠三個月所得的好處的話、那他不能不舉出况先生、以及由况先生的介紹認識的王、快要分離的王、</p>
<p>况先生是海埠有名交際家、在精神上、物質上、都帮助了他不少、這、在况先</p>

<h3>Policy Towards Russia Undecided</h3>
<p>Sun Ke Hosted a Banquet for Mo Dehui Yesterday</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Because the central government has not yet decided on its policy towards Russia, Mo Dehui will remain in Nanjing for two more weeks. The issue of Sino-Russian trade and resumption of diplomatic relations will be discussed further after Foreign Minister Wang recovers from his illness and the diplomatic group of the Central Political Council reconvenes. Mo will continue to attend. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain important figure in diplomatic circles was recently interviewed regarding the two issues of Sino-Russian trade and resumption of diplomatic relations. According to him, although Sino-Russian trade has not been realized, Harbin and Xinjiang have long been markets dominated by Russian goods. Russia transports its surplus goods to Xinjiang and transfers Xinjiang's production to Russia, taking whatever it wants. It is virtually an outer province of Russia. It may not be unwelcome if Russia imports inexpensive goods that China does not have. However, whether a complete trade agreement can be signed is still under study. Countries such as Japan and the United Kingdom have resumed diplomatic relations but have not yet signed trade agreements. The issue of resumption of diplomatic relations must be based on whether Russia can truly abandon communist propaganda. As Russia does with Turkey today, stopping all propaganda is the first step. It is also necessary to consider whether the domestic situation can allow the people to live and work in peace. Our country has been deeply influenced by five thousand years of ethics, and communism is difficult to assimilate. China and the Soviet Union share thousands of miles of border, and the relationship is complex and close. There should be a true understanding of the Russian situation, and in-depth research should be conducted to assist in dealing with it. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>(Nanjing) This afternoon, reporters visited Mo Dehui. According to him, he attended and reported at yesterday's diplomatic group meeting. Because of Wang Zhengting's illness, a policy has not yet been decided. He will remain in Nanjing in order to conduct detailed research with the central government. Regarding the issue of redeeming the Eastern Railway, he exchanged opinions with Karakhan in Russia. The Russian side has no objections. What needs to be studied is the method of redemption. However, this issue should be observed from the perspectives of both benefit and national sovereignty. For the sake of benefit, it would be best to wait until it can be recovered unconditionally after twenty-five years. Because even according to our lowest estimates, the redemption fee would be over two hundred million, and the interest alone would be twelve million per year. The Eastern Railway is still difficult to generate this amount of revenue annually. It is better to wait twenty-five years, when it can be recovered free of charge. However, for the sake of national sovereignty, it should be discussed separately, without considering the amount of benefit. The influence of overseas Chinese on the Eastern Railway is still not balanced. For example, of the three thousand employees of the entire railway, Russians occupy two thousand and Chinese only one thousand. In this round of layoffs, five hundred and fifty Russians and fifty Chinese were removed. The Russian side is already considered to have shown special goodwill. The central government is carefully considering the two issues of trade and resumption of diplomatic relations, which can be said to be closely related to diplomacy and domestic unity. The first Sino-Russian meeting was after Chiang returned to Nanjing from Henan. The second meeting was after Zhang Xueliang arrived in Nanjing. The attitude toward Russia is like this, and the attitude toward all diplomacy is the same. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<h3>Abolition of Consular Jurisdiction</h3>
<p>Achieving the Goal This Year</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Foreign Minister Wang's cold has not yet healed. He still went to the ministry on the 11th and told reporters that the government is firmly advocating the abolition of consular jurisdiction and is determined to achieve this goal this year. He hopes that friendly countries will uphold justice and treat us with sincerity to seek a solution quickly. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<h3>Xiamen Electric Bureau Takes Over Xiamen-Gulangyu Underwater Cable</h3>
<p>(Xiamen) The Xiamen Electric Bureau is scheduled to take over both the Great Northern and Great Eastern bureaus in Xiamen and Gulangyu on the 12th. (Special dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain gentleman from the Ministry of Communications told reporters that the Shanghai-Qi new contract has been under discussion for a long time. However, both sides have been extremely careful about the quotation, arguing over even the slightest discrepancy. Therefore, it has not yet been completed. External rumors regarding the negotiations are inaccurate. The Japanese representative may come to Nanjing next week to complete the signing procedures. The landline from Chuanshistan to Nantai in Fuzhou, which the Great Eastern Company borrowed from us, and the land and sea lines from Xiamen to Gulangyu, which the Great Northern Company borrowed, were originally planned by the Ministry of Communications to be recovered uniformly at the end of last year. Later, the company requested an extension of six weeks to facilitate the completion. Now that the extension period has expired, the Ministry of Communications telegraphed the Fuzhou and Xiamen electric bureaus on the 11th, ordering them to recover all of the land and sea lines. Both companies should cease operations in Fuzhou and Xiamen. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 11th)</p>

<p>(Xi'an) Yang Hucheng telegraphed Sun Weiru, stating that Zhao's brigade had reached Nanzheng and all nearby bandits were fleeing far towards the Sichuan border. However, the situation of the army and bandits on the Sichuan border is complex, and it is still appropriate to suppress them separately in order to complete the task of pacification. He ordered the division commander to quickly advance his troops to Hanzhong in stages. The 173rd brigade should take over the defense duties of Sun's division in Fengxiang, and ordered them to rush to construct an airfield in Nanzheng and Fengxiang, completing it within a limited time.

<h3>News Regarding US Bank Loan</h3>
<p>(Beiping) According to foreign banking circles, the price of silver is falling in the US, and the silver mined is not enough for industrial refining. Therefore, US investment in China is becoming more profound. They are now unofficially negotiating with important Chinese officials stationed in the US, and there are concerns in China about rising silver prices and the possibility of prices falling again. They can agree on a fair price to pay for the silver, so that neither side suffers. This view is still that the US is planning for itself, and the benefits to China are not deep. If silver prices fall to the point where industrial refining is not possible, then silver production in the US and Mexico will inevitably decrease, and gold prices will inevitably slowly fall.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Various Aspects of the World Economy</h3>
<p>First, according to a survey by the Japanese Ministry of Finance, the rate of trade decline in the five countries of Japan, the United States, Britain, France, and Germany shows that Japan has the highest rate of export decline at 31.5 percent, followed by the United States at 26.6 percent, then Britain, then France, and finally Germany. In terms of imports, the United States has the highest rate at 30.4 percent, followed by Japan, then Germany, then Britain, and finally France. Based on this observation, although the rates vary, the decline in both imports and exports is consistent. The sluggishness of trade is evident from this.</p>
<p>Second, according to a memorandum from the British Treasury, the national expenditure on social undertakings, excluding war pensions, has increased from £28 million in 1910 to £158 million in 1930. In terms of unemployment insurance alone, the increase in 1931 compared to 1928 was £45 million. The increasing number of unemployed people in Britain is self-evident. The memorandum also states that tax revenues in 1931 are bound to decrease, which implies that the economic downturn is not expected to recover in the near future.</p>
<p>Third, the Washington State legislature in the United States passed a resolution petitioning Congress to rescue the silver market. The petition asks Congress to pay attention to the rapidly declining price of silver worldwide and to convene an international conference to jointly discuss the rescue. This is because the cheap silver price has drastically reduced the purchasing power of China and other Eastern countries, further exacerbating the world's economic depression. The concern and attention towards the world economy has reached an extreme level.</p>

<h3>Japan's Trade Surplus</h3>
<p>Decline in Japanese Purchasing Power - Reflection of Economic Downturn</p>
<p>Comparison of Trade Reduction Rates in Five Countries</p>
<p>▲Exports: Japan Highest, US Second</p>
<p>▲Imports: US Highest, Japan Second</p>
<p>▲Dentsu, Tokyo, 11th - Japan's trade surplus in the first ten days of the month was 7.8 million yen. This surplus during the import period is a rare occurrence in recent years, and has surprised many. However, this surplus is not due to increased exports, but rather a sharp decline in total trade volume, especially a decline in purchasing power for miscellaneous goods, with no sign of improvement in imports.</p>
<p>▲The World News Agency reports that, according to a survey by the Japanese Ministry of Finance, the trade reduction rate for Japan, the United States, Britain, France, and Germany is highest for exports in Japan at 31.5%, followed by the United States at 26.6%. For imports, the reduction rate is highest for the United States at 30.4%, followed by Japan at 29.6%. The table is as follows: (Unit: Japan million yen, US million dollars, UK million pounds, France million francs, Germany million marks)</p>
<p>Year Before Last　　Last Year　　Percentage Reduction</p>
<p>Japan Imports　1,680　2,388　29.6</p>
<p>Japan Exports　1,518　2,217　31.5</p>

<h3>Disposition of British Boxer Indemnity</h3>
<p>Disagreement Arises at Three British Universities</p>
<p>Discussion to Be Postponed for One Week</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 10th - The proposed application of the Chinese indemnity, namely the disposition of the Boxer indemnity returned by Britain, was discussed in the House of Commons Select Committee today. The Conservative Party proposed postponing the debate on the proposal for one week for careful consideration of amendments, as Oxford, Cambridge, and Manchester universities have raised objections to the sudden progress of the proposal. The three universities hope that their interests will not be ignored under the proposal's measures. The three universities have been paying attention to Chinese culture and scholarship, and it seems appropriate for the government to meet with representatives of the three universities. Foreign Office Under-Secretary Dalton said that the government is prepared to meet with university representatives to discuss the matter. The House of Commons has now approved the Conservative Party's proposal to postpone the debate. The proposal is based on the report of the Chinese Indemnity Committee, which proposes that the returned indemnity be used for: (1) improving Chinese education; (2) developing Chinese enterprises, such as railway construction. The beneficiary of the educational part of the proposal is the University of Hong Kong.</p>

<h3>Japanese Government Decides on Policy Toward Parliament</h3>
<p>Budget Review Extended by Five Days</p>
<p>Leaders of the Seiyūkai and Minseitō to Meet Soon</p>
<p>Uprising of the Anti-Government Faction in the House of Peers</p>
<p>▲Dentsu, Tokyo, 11th - The government held a cabinet meeting in the Diet building at 7 pm last night, inviting party leaders and Chairman Takeuchi of the Budget Committee to attend and discuss countermeasures for the upcoming Diet session and the Chairman of the Budget Committee. All agreed that if the Seiyukai brings a vote of no confidence on the budget before the plenary session, citing a slip of the tongue, the government will counterattack. The problem of a slip of the tongue is different from the problem of an Imperial Rescript and is not an error of conduct, but merely a slip of the tongue. If this is used as a material for attack, it would be tantamount to hiding under the sleeves of the Emperor (meaning seeking shelter under the Emperor) to launch an attack, which is highly inappropriate. The government is determined to counterattack with an absolute majority to prevent it from succeeding.</p>
<p>▲Dentsu, Tokyo, 11th - The House of Representatives' representatives of each faction held a meeting at 2 pm on the 10th. The Minseitō proposed extending the budget review period by three days, while the Seiyukai proposed five days. As a result of the discussion, it was decided to extend it by five days. At 5:30 pm, the Budget Committee was convened, and the following order was decided: The Budget Committee will be convened at 10 am on the 12th, where Prime Minister HARA will withdraw his slip of the tongue, and then Nakajima and Ando of the Seiyukai will continue to question him. Branch meetings will be held on the 13th and 14th, the attitude of each branch meeting will be determined on the 16th, and the budget will be placed on the agenda for the plenary session on the 17th.</p>
<p>▲Dentsu, Tokyo, 11th - Based on the agreement between the Minseitō and Seiyūkai yesterday morning on purifying the parliament, the Parliament Reform Committee held its first meeting in the Diet building at 6 pm last night. As a result of the discussion, the following was generally decided: (1) The Minseitō and Seiyūkai will withdraw all accusations; (2) The leaders of the two parties will meet and have another serious discussion; (3) The committee will elect members to discuss appropriate methods, such as amending the Diet Law and the Rules of Procedure. However, when the Minseitō proposed a meeting between the leaders of the two parties, the Minseitō used Interior Minister Adachi as the party leader representative, acting for President Hamaguchi. The Seiyukai reserved their immediate response and adjourned the meeting first. At 7 pm, Akita visited President Inukai at his private residence to report on the progress of the negotiations with the Minseitō and inquire about Mr. Inukai's intentions. Mr. Inukai immediately agreed to meet.</p>
<p>▲Dentsu, Tokyo, 10th - The Seiyukai hopes to use the problem of a slip of the tongue to encourage an uprising of the anti-government faction in the House of Peers, so that the two houses can echo each other and attack the government from both sides. These Imperial-appointed members of the House of Peers from the anti-government faction and large taxpayers from the anti-government faction held their first joint meeting at 6 pm last night. Forty-four people, including Suzuki, Katsuta, and Hanai, attended. They each expressed strong opinions on the problem of a slip of the tongue and financial problems, and decided to work together to censure the government.</p>
<h3>Polish Foreign Minister Unstable in Position</h3>

<h3>Austrian Presidential Re-Election</h3>

<p>▲National News Agency, Vienna, 10th - The Austrian presidential re-election has been scheduled for October 18th in accordance with the newly amended constitution. The new president will be elected by the entire nation for a term of seven years.</p>
<h3>British Unemployment Insurance Problem</h3>
<p>Treasury Submits Memorandum to the Royal Commission</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 10th - The British Treasury has prepared a memorandum and submitted it to the Royal Commission investigating the unemployment insurance problem, stating the large increase in social welfare expenditures and its impact on future budgets and the British fiscal system. It is said that, apart from war pensions, the nation's social welfare expenditures have increased from £28 million in 1910 to £158 million in 1930. For unemployment insurance alone, the Treasury will have to pay £55 million in 1931, an increase of £45 million compared to 1928. Even under the most favorable circumstances, such a large increase in expenditures will make the budget difficult and break the balance based on existing tax laws. Moreover, national tax revenues are bound to decrease in 1931. If the balance is to be maintained, expenditures must be reduced to match the decrease in tax revenues. The debt owed for unemployment insurance was changed to £39 million at the beginning of 1930, and will reach £72 million to £75 million by April of the following year. If borrowing on such a large scale continues without adequate preparation for repayment, doubts will soon arise about the stability of the British fiscal system. Therefore, the scope of borrowing must be greatly reduced, and the basic fund must be reorganized so that the debt can be repaid quickly under more favorable circumstances. It is now necessary to set an urgent plan, on the one hand to reduce the benefits received by the beneficiaries, and on the other hand to increase the subsidies of those who subsidize this fund.</p>
<h3>Trans-Pacific Flight</h3>
<p>Yoshihara Scheduled to Depart from Japan at the End of April</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Tokyo, 11th - Trans-Pacific flights from the US have already been made, but there has been no flight from Japan to the US.

Yoshihara flew from Berlin to Tokyo last year and is a famous pilot in the Japanese aviation community. This time he plans to fly from Tokyo to San Francisco, a distance of about 10,000 kilometers. He will set up refueling points along the way.</p>
<h3>Washington State Legislature Petitions Congress to Save Silver Market</h3>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Reorganization of the Jin Army Reaches a Conclusion</h3>
<p>▲Establishment of a Military Commission Still Pending</p>
<p>Taiyuan dispatch, since Sun Chu and others sent a telegram to Zhang Xueliang from Jiangxi, the issue of military reduction here has indeed come to an end. However, what has not yet been resolved is the issue of the Military Commission. Yesterday afternoon, the mediator Lu Fengnian hosted a special banquet for the military commanders at his private residence. During the banquet, the military reduction plan and the necessity of establishing a military commission were discussed again, and the results were quite satisfactory. The troops of Song Zheyuan and Sun Dianying have now been reorganized and disbanded. The Northeast has dispatched Fu Zhan Kui to Bingzhou and then to Yuncheng, Jincheng, and other places for verification. Mr. Fu is expected to arrive in the next day or two. As for the military police, Chen Xingya returned from Wutai Mountain last night and should be able to negotiate with Li Runfa. The position of commander will still belong to Mr. Li. Also, Sun Chu's remarks on the reorganization and disbandment, which were published yesterday, are quite relevant. He said, "The issue that the military commanders disagreed with the most in the Tianjin negotiations was the issue of mutual transfers of troops. Because the officers and soldiers of each unit have been together for a long time, they naturally have their historical connections. If the Tianjin agreement is followed, Zhang Huizhao's troops, which are currently stationed in Datong and as far as Chaigoupu, would have to be transferred to the east of Yangquan, and Li Fuying's troops would have to be transferred to the area of Suiyuan. How can such mutual transfers not cause the soldiers to lose their usual joy with each other, and the residents along the way would inevitably suffer harassment, or even abscond with their weapons and become bandits? Judging from what has been heard in the past, this is an inevitable fact. The military commanders' insistence on phased reorganization is nothing more than to avoid local chaos, because phased reorganization should not be sudden, and the officers and soldiers of each unit will be spared the suffering of repeated transfers back and forth. In this way, the reorganization will proceed smoothly in three to five months. Therefore, the military commanders' efforts to strive for phased reorganization at that time were for this purpose, and were not about opposing someone or arguing over a position. Regarding the reorganization issue, after repeated consultations between the military commanders and Shang Xuyang in recent days, a modified plan has been completely determined. However, the principles of the Tianjin meeting have not been changed in the slightest. Regarding the modified plan, the results obtained have been telegraphed to Zhang by Ji (Yiqiao) and Hu (Yiling). The military commanders believe that if this matter is not resolved for one day, the people will bear an additional burden of more than 100,000 yuan per day. If this continues for a long time and is not resolved, the people will inevitably suffer. For the sake of the people's livelihood, the generals have decided to formally telegraph Zhang within two to three days via Shang Xuyang to request instructions. Once Zhang's consent telegram arrives, the military commanders will immediately assume their posts and take responsibility. Currently, the Jin army is said to have ten armies, but in reality, each army only has nine regiments, each army is divided into three divisions, and each division only has three regiments. If each regiment is calculated with 1,500 people, plus various special forces, each division is only around 5,000 people. The Tianjin conference organization is based on the Northeast organization. The Northeast army follows a large organization, each regiment has 1,800 people, each division of four regiments, there have been more than 7,000 people, plus special forces, it has been not less than 8,000 people. According to this organization, the existing soldiers are not enough, but the number of officials dismissed, is indeed very large, not the issue of how many, that is proof of this. As for the establishment of the Military Commission, it is the most pressing need for internal affairs. The reason for this is that the Jin army cadres mostly come from here, and the soldiers are also mostly from Shanxi. In the course of past wars, the number of people killed and injured is unknown. Matters such as the payment of pensions, plus the aftermath of the completion of the reduction, all require a fixed high-level organization to handle them. Without this organization, the above matters will inevitably be ignored, and the authorities' hearts will inevitably be uneasy. Therefore, there was a previous proposal to organize this commission as the main body for the payment of pensions to the families of the deceased and the handling of the aftermath after the completion of the reorganization. However, this commission is purely for internal, temporary, and not permanent purposes. As for the organization of this commission, it is planned to reorganize the existing headquarters, and personnel</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>will be eliminated. According to the recent consultations, this commission is indeed likely to be established, but one point that needs to be clarified is that the outside world has heard of the organization of this commission and is inevitably surprised, suspecting that it is a disguised headquarters, which is a big mistake. It must be understood that the significance of the establishment of this commission is to handle various unfinished matters related to the aftermath. (February 8th)</p>
<h3>Statistics on Shanxi People's Drug Use</h3>
<p>▲Golden Pills and White Powder Are Everywhere in the Province</p>
<p>▲Annual Expenditure Reaches 60 Million</p>
<p>▲There Are Drug Manufacturing Plants in Bo'ai County</p>
<p>Taiyuan dispatch, In Shanxi Province, the amount of Golden Pills and white powder narcotics used has increased over the years. According to unofficial statistics, Shanxi Province remits approximately 60 million yuan to Tianjin each year to purchase raw materials. Approximately 70% of the people in the province use the material. Therefore, it is indeed a major social problem. Government offices have been extremely strict in investigating the source of the material, but traffickers use all kinds of tricks, making it difficult to crack down on them. Therefore, it is generally believed that although Shanxi has achieved considerable success in banning opium and Golden Pills, the source of the material has actually increased. This is especially prevalent in the border counties of southern Shanxi. It is said that the largest secret den for manufacturing Golden Pills is located in Xinzhuang, a village on the border of Henan Province (belonging to Bo'ai County. Bo'ai County is the former Qinghua Town. Xinzhuang is about 30 miles from Jincheng and about 20 miles from Bo'ai County. The village has about 3,000 households, of which about 95% are Hui people. The area is wealthy and the scenery is very beautiful, with rice paddies and bamboo gardens everywhere, which leads to extravagant customs. Also, because the villagers are naturally fierce, robbery cases have occurred frequently in the border area between Shanxi and Henan in recent times, mostly committed by the residents there. As for how the area has become a major secret den for manufacturing Golden Pills, it is because many of the villagers travel between Tianjin and Shanghai to engage in the leather business. These merchants saw that it was profitable, so this trend became very popular. Activities such as manufacturing, using, and selling became rampant in the area. Also, because the people there are naturally fierce, whenever defeated soldiers retreat there during the years of turmoil in Henan Province, the villagers will surround the fleeing soldiers and order them to surrender their weapons. Therefore, they have obtained many weapons over the years. They now have more than 1,000 pistols, more than 2,000 rifles, and more than 100 machine guns, and they have built stone houses in important locations in the village, resembling military bunkers. Therefore, the villagers rely on their business capital and the weapons they have acquired over the years to specialize in the Golden Pill business. There are three or four manufacturing companies in the village, and the capital is also raised through shares. The exact amount is difficult to know from the outside. Some villagers are manufacturers, some are transporters, and some stay behind to house merchants and act as intermediaries. Child laborers and female laborers are responsible for manufacturing, packaging, testing, and other tasks. The source of the raw materials is from Shanghai, divided into two types, coarse and fine. Fine goods are popular in more than ten counties in the Shangdang area of Shanxi, and Jincheng on the border of Shanxi is the first to be affected because it is adjacent to Bo'ai. In Jincheng County alone, the money spent by the people on using the material each month is approximately 100,000 yuan, and the amount spent each month in the ten counties in the Shangdang area should be around 1 million yuan, which is shocking. Furthermore, the fluctuating exchange rate between Shanxi currency and silver dollars between Taiyuan and Jincheng also has a significant relationship with this matter. When the manufactured Golden Pills are transported outward, they are gathered into a group of hundreds or dozens of people, each carrying weapons. Each group is a unit. Although each county has tobacco control inspectors and police, they can only hide and disappear when they encounter them passing through the border, and dare not confront them. The scale of their power is evident. It is said that the company's internal organization also has certain regulations. Each company also prepares a monthly public fund, which is specifically used for social expenses. The amount that each company should contribute depends on the amount of its output. If there is any danger during the manufacture or transportation, or if someone dies due to illness, the company also has a kind of maintenance fund. Therefore, many residents there are happy to engage in this business. (4th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Merchants in Xiang Resist Paying Business Tax</h3>
<p>▲Japanese Consul in Xiang Shields Them</p>
<p>▲Department of Finance Submits Petition to Ministry to Protest</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: After the provincial government of Hunan was ordered to abolish likin, it prepared to abolish all the original unified tax bureaus and checkpoints throughout the province. At the same time, in accordance with the law, it selected key counties to establish business tax collection agencies. It has been a month since the preparations began, and just as it was expected that the implementation would be smooth and beneficial to local tax revenue, it was unexpected that Japanese merchants in Hunan would resist paying this business tax. Moreover, the Japanese Consul in Hunan, citing instructions from the Minister of Foreign Affairs of his country, argued that Japanese merchants in China had never borne this type of tax and shielded them. The occurrence of this situation is not only sufficient to obstruct the progress of the new tax in Hunan Province but also hinders China's tax rights. The Department of Finance has now submitted a report to the Ministry of Finance, requesting that it be forwarded to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for negotiation. The text of the Department of Finance's report is recorded as follows: "Regarding the implementation of business tax in Hunan Province, the matter of foreign merchants in Hunan paying taxes has been communicated by the provincial government to the consuls concerned, requesting compliance. Subsequently, a letter from the Japanese Consul in Hunan, Yasutani Renji, was received, stating: 'To the Director: I have received your official letter dated the 30th of this month with the reference number Cai 73, stating that the likin and all similar taxes in your country have been abolished from January 1931, according to the instructions of the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance. All the original unified tax bureaus and checkpoints in Hunan Province have been abolished, and at the same time, business tax collection agencies have been established in various counties in Hunan to collect business tax and business license fees from all merchants, effective from January 1931. You requested that I instruct Japanese merchants residing here to comply and pay taxes. I have also received the Hunan Province Business Tax Collection Regulations, the Hunan Province Business Tax Collection Detailed Rules, the Hunan Business License Application Regulations, and the Hunan Province County Business Tax Review Committee Provisional Regulations. I have read and understood them. However, regarding this matter, this consulate has not received any instructions from its superiors before, so it is difficult to handle. I am replying accordingly for your information.' The Department is awaiting the consul's request for instructions and reply. Now, we have received an official letter from the Secretariat of the Hunan Provincial Government, stating: 'To the Director: The Chairman has reviewed the letter from the Japanese Consul in Hunan, denying the payment of business license tax by Japanese merchants. Regarding whether it should be recorded and reported to the ministry for instructions or how to reply, the original letter is enclosed for your department to handle.' Enclosed is the original letter. Upon investigation, foreign merchants operating in Hunan are equally protected by Chinese law and should uniformly pay business tax to demonstrate fairness. The Department previously reported to your Ministry in December of last year, and it was approved by telegraph. Now, the Japanese Consul has written a letter, stating that he has received instructions from the Foreign Minister of his country that Japanese merchants in China have never borne this type of tax, and this business tax should not be paid either, which is indeed hindering our tax rights. Moreover, Hunan Province is not the only country with foreign merchants; if Japanese merchants are the first to resist payment, merchants from other countries will inevitably follow suit. In the future, Japanese merchants will affect merchants from other countries, and Hunan Province will affect foreign merchants nationwide. Even unscrupulous merchants in our country may impersonate foreigners to seek tax exemptions. Inspection will become difficult, and tax revenue will inevitably decrease. The disadvantages are unimaginable. It is requested that you forward the matter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, instructing the Japanese Minister in Beijing to instruct the Japanese Consul in Hunan to inform the merchants of his country to comply with the regulations and pay taxes to uphold national rights and maintain tax laws. A document is hereby submitted, along with a copy of the Japanese Consul's reply, for your Ministry to review and instruct accordingly.'" (2nd)</p>
<h3>Large-Scale Suppression of Communist Bandits on the Guangdong Border</h3>
<p>▲Li Mingrui's Band Flees from Lian County to Lechang</p>
<p>▲Zhu De and Mao Zedong's Band from Jiangxi Invades Guangdong Border but is Repelled</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Li Mingrui's Communist bandit band from Xiaobei River in Guangdong Province was recently defeated in Lian County and has retreated to the border between Hunan and Guangdong. They are indirectly heading towards southern Hunan, planning to cross over to Rucheng and other places in northern Guangdong, attempting to join forces with various bands in western Jiangxi. When the bandit band was leaving Lian County, they plundered no less than sixty to seventy thousand yuan in cash. Fortunately, they did not enter the city, so the residents of Lian County were spared from disaster. However, more than a hundred shops outside the West Gate of the city have been burned down. Recently, various community organizations in Lian County sent telegrams reporting the bandits' trail, stating that the Communist bandit Li Mingrui led his troops to Lian on the [馬日 - cannot be translated]. They attacked the county seat for four days and nights. Fortunately, the army fought bravely to resist, ensuring safety. However, more than a hundred shops and houses outside the city were burned, causing significant losses. The bandits, hearing that the defense army was approaching, lifted the siege on the evening of [有晚 - cannot be translated] and are still lingering in the county. Another telegram stated that Deng's regiment arrived in Liancheng, and the public breathed a sigh of relief. Li Mingrui's troops are unpredictable and are harassing the border area. Now that news has arrived that Deng's troops are departing, the public is even more shocked, urging the dispatch of orders to Deng's regimental commander to leave troops in Lian to maintain stability. After Li's troops retreated from Lian County, a part of them arrived in Longping on the 27th, joining forces with Deng Shixi's bandit gang from Yangshan, and besieged Xingyuan in Yangshan County. The Yangshan County government urgently dispatched the police guard and the First Battalion of the regular army, along with 400 reservists, to gather in Libu, together with a company of the Lian County police guard, to launch a fierce suppression against the local communists. The local communists also resisted stubbornly, and after a fierce battle for half a day, the local communists were defeated and retreated to the old lair of Bailian Qi Gong. In this battle, more than thirty bandits were killed, and a red flag and several fake proclamations were seized. Currently, the remaining bandits, seeing that Li's troops have fled to Ping Shi, have also gathered and followed the main force, so there are no bandit traces in Bailian Qi Gong and other places. However, when Li's troops initially fled northeast from Lian County, they headed towards Ping Shi, intending to break through the border between Hunan and Guangdong at Yizhang and Lechang. The county magistrate of Lechang has already sent an urgent telegram to the province to report. The authorities have now transferred Guo Runhua's regiment of the Guangdong North Defense Army to Ping Shi at full speed. The regiment traveled along the Shao Ping Highway on January 31, arrived in Jiu Feng on February 1, and reached Ping Shi yesterday. In recent days, the Shaoguan Defense Army has also continued to use cars to transport troops to Lechang. As for Deng's regiment stationed in Lian County, they are pursuing and suppressing from Lian County, having already passed Xing Zi and heading north from Xing Zi to Lechang Ping Shi, assisting the troops dispatched from Shao to block and attack. However, the 8th Route Headquarters is still concerned that the defense forces in the area are weak, so on the evening of the 3rd, it issued an order to Yan Yingyu's regiment of the 63rd Division stationed at the sulfuric acid plant in Wuzhou to return to Guangdong from Wuzhou. The regiment immediately boarded more than 30 civilian ships that evening and headed east on the morning of the 4th. At 12:00 on the 5th, they all arrived in the province. After replenishing their military supplies, they took the Yuehan Railway train to Shao on the 6th, transferring to Ping Shi to assist in suppressing the bandit troops.</p>
<p>At the end of January, fierce battles between government troops and communist bandits also occurred on the border between eastern Guangdong and Jiangxi. On the 28th of the previous month, the Communist bandits of Zhu De and Mao Zedong from Jiangxi suddenly sent a force of about four to five thousand people, heading south from Yudu, capturing Xunwu, and sending a part of their force to invade the territory of Pingyuan County in Guangdong. At that time, only two companies of the 247th Regiment of the Defense Army were stationed in Pingyuan. In addition to desperately resisting, they urgently telegraphed Shantou for assistance. Xiang Hanping, the commander of the 62nd Division, transferred Chen Ju's 248th Regiment stationed in Jiaoling to reinforce the defense and telegraphed the headquarters, requesting that Wu Jianxiong's 246th Regiment stationed in Beijiang be quickly dispatched to Dongjiang for support. Chen Yang's regiment arrived in Pingyuan and engaged the bandit army. Unexpectedly, the bandit army suddenly increased to seven or eight thousand people, and their momentum was great. Xiang Hanping then transferred two battalions of Li Zhenliang's 247th Regiment and a special service company with machine guns and mortars from Xingning to the Fenshuicao area, launching successive suppression efforts. After fighting the bandits for two days and nights, they finally dispersed the bandits, who fled to Anyuan in a disarray. In this battle, dozens of bandits were killed, and government troops also suffered some casualties. Currently, Xiang Hanping is still concerned that the remaining bandits are lurking on the border and has agreed with the headquarters to leave Wu's regiment in Dongjiang awaiting orders. Wu's regiment departed from Shixing in Beijiang on the 3rd to return to the province and transfer to Dongjiang. Yan Yingyu's regiment will fill the defense of Shixing. (February 6)</p>
<h3>Reasons for the Decline of Commerce in Shenyang</h3>
<p>▲The Impact of Money Shortage and Gold Inflation</p>
<p>▲More Than a Thousand Stores Close Down</p>
<p>▲Government Agencies Prepare Relief Measures</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: In recent years, all construction projects in Shenyang have made significant progress. However, the commercial sector has been in a state of depression and hardship, reaching its extreme. The main reasons are nothing more than the money shortage and the gold inflation. The market and commercial firms have been affected by this, leading to frequent closures. According to statistics from the Chamber of Commerce, there are approximately 15,000 commercial firms in Shenyang, and more than 1,000 have closed down this year, which is indeed a major problem in the Northeast today. Generally speaking, the standard of living in the Northeast is higher than that in the interior. In previous years, rising prices did not hinder merchants. This year, prices of various goods have fallen sharply, but there are fewer customers, so the commercial downturn of recent years is particularly severe this year. The so-called money shortage has become a common phrase among merchants, and the culprit behind the money shortage is the Feng Piao (Feng Tiao, Feng Currency). The Feng Piao's shortage is partly due to the government's unlimited issuance and partly due to the manipulation of unscrupulous Japanese merchants. When the Feng Piao was first issued, it was fully convertible without any loss. The so-called small silver coupons, which were valued at twelve jiao for one silver dollar, were relatively convenient for merchants to circulate. Later, the Japanese secretly manipulated, deliberately collecting Feng Piao from the market with silver dollars and exchanging them for silver dollars at the official silver bank, repeatedly causing chaos. (At that time, the Feng Piao gradually had a discount.) Over time, the value fell. The official silver bank, fearing that it would be unable to handle the situation if it continued, then issued silver dollar notes, which were not allowed to be cashed, for circulation in the market. However, Shanghai, Wuhan, Tianjin, and Jinan could be used for remittances to prevent fraudulent withdrawals. However, the number of issues was unlimited, and the value fell sharply. As of now, the authorities have stipulated that each Feng Piao is equivalent to one silver dollar, and the price has stabilized. However, 70% of the merchants have been ruined by this, so the older the brand, the greater the loss. As for gold inflation, it is not unique to the Eastern Provinces; all provinces have been affected. However, merchants in the Eastern Provinces have special circumstances. When the Feng Piao was falling, the Japanese used large sums of gold (the old-fashioned Korean currency, called gold notes by Shenyang merchants) to lend to farmers and merchants in the Eastern Provinces. The interest rate ranged from eight li to a maximum of one fen and two li, with most being one fen. The total amount reached 160 million yuan, with Shenyang alone reaching 80 million yuan. After the gold inflation, the gold notes also soared. Within a year, the exchange rate rose from one yuan and a few jiao in silver dollars for one yuan in gold notes to more than two yuan. Therefore, merchants who borrowed Japanese gold suffered heavy losses, and the financial situation in Shenyang was on the verge of bankruptcy. The Shenyang General Chamber of Commerce has repeatedly requested the authorities to find ways to provide relief to maintain the market. In the winter of 1929, the official silver bank of the Eastern Provinces had the intention of issuing silver dollar exchange coupons to restore the silver standard and maintain the market. However, it feared that the preparations would be insufficient, leading to the same mistakes as with the Feng Piao, so it hesitated to issue them. Currently, the money market is becoming increasingly scarce. After repeated requests from the Chamber of Commerce and after review by the authorities, it was deemed necessary to issue them. Recently, the official silver bank reissued 20 million exchange coupons, which are used in silver dollars without any discount. Since their circulation, the market has shown some activity. However, Shenyang's commerce has long been in a critical situation, and the lack of cash has reached its peak. The provincial government, recognizing this, has taken measures to maintain the prosperity of the provincial capital, including providing commercial and industrial loans. The method is for the government to order the official silver bank to provide 1.5 million yuan in cash to the Chamber of Commerce to establish a commercial and industrial loan office, which will lend to merchants in Shenyang at an interest rate of one fen and five li. The office is attached to the Chamber of Commerce and began accepting applications on the 1st of this month. Commercial firms that wish to borrow must first apply there, stating the name of the firm, the amount of the loan, the names of the shareholders, the names of the executives, the amount of capital, and the location. They must also have sufficient collateral and two guarantor firms. After the office completes the investigation and review, it can formally issue the loan. Since applications began on the 1st, 170 firms have applied as of the evening of the 4th, requesting loans of approximately 400,000 yuan. It is planned that the Chamber of Commerce will convene a board meeting on the 5th to review the applications of the firms to determine whether they are sound and whether the collateral is sufficient. After the review, the first batch of loans will be issued. However, the amount of loans is somewhat limited. For example, with 10,000 yuan of collateral, only 3,000 yuan can be borrowed. The maximum amount is 3,000 yuan. With 20,000 yuan of collateral, only 3,000 yuan can be borrowed. The cash is still stored in the official silver bank, and the General Chamber of Commerce only acts as an intermediary. The government's intention is to maintain the market and financial situation and to resist the input and manipulation of foreign capital. (4th)</p>
<h3>Transfer of Jurisdiction in the Harbin Official Murder Case</h3>
<p>▲Northeast Political Affairs Committee Orders Shenyang Court to Hear the Case</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: At 9:00 AM on the 6th, the Binjiang District Court received an order from the Northeast Branch of the Liaoning High Court, forwarded by the Northeast Political Affairs Committee, instructing that the case of Ye Yixiong, a judge of the Special District Court, murdering Zhang Wang Liqing, the female owner of the Xie Xing Sauce Garden, be transferred to the Shenyang District Court for retrial. According to the procedure, the Shenyang District Court Prosecutor's Office will first investigate and then file a lawsuit with the same-level court. Last night, the court assigned four judicial police officers to escort the files and Ye Yixiong to Liaoning. However, the transfer did not take place because the official transfer documents and all procedures had not been completed. It is scheduled to depart at 10:45 PM tonight. Last night, Ye's wife, Peng Churu, visited her husband at the detention center twice, bringing clothes and money. The couple met, hugged each other, and cried. The fellow inmates were all moved to tears. Ye, feeling that he had brought it upon himself, expected that there would be no good outcome after the transfer to Liaoning and repeatedly called out to his wife, "I'm sorry, I'm ashamed." However, the Binjiang Court originally intended to handle this case and did not dare to be negligent. After the first public trial on the 19th of last month, it was delayed for many days due to the illness of Judge Jia Jingyang. On the 3rd of this month, Jia returned to work after recovering from his illness and summoned Zhang Wang Liqing and Ye Yixiong to court. The chief clerk, Zhang Yimin, read the records of the original plaintiff and defendant, and Ye Zhang confirmed that they were accurate and agreed to sign them. The court had scheduled the third public trial for the 9th of this month, and the summons had already been issued. Yesterday morning, they suddenly received a telegram transferring jurisdiction, which brought the matter to a close and transferred the case to Liaoning. It is reported that on the 4th of this month, the Northeast Political Affairs Committee held a regular meeting, attended by Deputy Commander Zhang Xueliang. Seeing the reports in the newspapers about the second public trial and the slow handling of the case by the Binjiang Court, he immediately raised it for discussion. It was the consensus that the case was related to the reputation of the Northeast judicial community and the movement to reclaim extraterritoriality, so they all advocated transferring jurisdiction and returning to [歸 - incomplete sentence in original]. As for Zhang Wang Liqing, unable to collect the 7,050 yuan in drafts and unable to borrow money, and with the case further delayed, she did not know when it would end. In anxiety, her wound recurred yesterday, and her lung disease worsened. The First Goodness Hospital administered several injections, but there was still no improvement. It is also reported that after Ye is escorted to Shenyang, the Prosecutor's Office will first investigate and then summon Zhang Wang Liqing to the case. (February 7)</p>
<h3>Implementation of Contract System in Shandong Province</h3>
<p>▲Revising the Value of Fields and Houses</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Department of Finance yesterday proposed at the Provincial Government Standing Committee that all counties implement a contract system and revise the value of fields and houses, which has been approved and will be promulgated and implemented from April. The measures set by the department are as follows: "The investigation of contract tax in this province has always been a major source of income for the provincial treasury. Regulations have been promulgated and strictly enforced to the best of our ability. However, county residents are accustomed to old habits, often delaying the payment of taxes when purchasing fields and houses, or writing down the contract price, which affects tax revenue significantly. To rectify tax revenue, two measures are proposed as follows: (1) It is proposed to order all counties to implement a contract paper system as a basis for urging tax payment. The contract income depends on the number of field and house transactions. In order to investigate whether county residents have delayed paying taxes, in December of the sixth year of the Republic of China, in accordance with the contract issuance method promulgated by the Ministry, counties were ordered to establish contract issuance offices to sell contracts for use by county residents when transferring fields and houses. The county governments can use this contract stub to investigate whether there are households that have delayed paying taxes and can use it as a basis for urging tax payment. However, since its implementation, most have followed the establishment, while some have not established it due to special circumstances. If the delay is allowed to continue, it will greatly hinder the future of tax revenue. It seems that all counties should be ordered to complete the establishment of the aforementioned issuance offices, earnestly promote them, and report them. They should also prepare and equip a circulating contract sales book in accordance with the regulations, which will be circulated monthly by each issuance office for the county to check and verify, thereby urging tax payment. If any person does not purchase a contract in accordance with the regulations but pays taxes with a draft contract, the tax will not be allowed to show restriction. However, the original price of this contract was set at five copper coins per sheet for printing materials and subsidies for the office. Later, in August of the 18th year, according to the reports from Qihe Teng County and other counties that it was not enough for application, former Director Yuan changed it to ten copper coins per sheet. Recently, according to reports from various counties that the current prices of goods are expensive and still not enough for application, please increase it. After verification, it may be the case, it seems that the sales price of this item should be changed to twenty copper coins per sheet to make up for it and facilitate implementation. (2) It is proposed to order all counties to re-determine the value of fields and houses as a standard for tax collection. The original value of fields and houses was set up to prevent writing down the contract price. In the past, in the ninth and thirteenth and fourteenth years of the Republic of China, the counties were ordered three times to determine the fair price according to the actual value at that time, divided into three grades: upper, middle, and lower. If the contract price for tax payment exceeds the assessed value, the tax will still be collected according to the contract price. If it is less than the assessed value, the assessed value will be the standard. All departments have followed this in the case. However, this value varies from time to time and cannot be fixed. Currently, the value of fields and houses in various counties is more expensive than in the past. If it is not re-determined, it will not be appropriate. It seems that all counties should be ordered to re-determine and report the value of fields and houses as a standard for tax collection. The above two measures are important for rectifying the contract tax and should be carried out in order. However, the contract tax of each county, from January to the end of March of this year, has just been ordered to be collected at half the original rate of six percent for purchase and three percent for mortgage, in order to make it easy and encourage payment, and to show consideration. It should be waited until this case is over before ordering the counties to do it accordingly. The relevant details are respectfully requested for public decision." It was decided that it should be handled as proposed. (February 9)</p>
<h3>Overflow of Ice Floes in the Yellow River in Shandong</h3>
<p>▲Two Places Overflow in Fan County</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Yellow River is currently in the period of ice floe overflow, and dangerous works are emerging one after another. The people's embankment at Liao Qiao on the north bank of Fan County upstream reported two breaches with a width of eight zhang. Upon investigation, the biggest reason is that the weather this winter has been erratic, with the river ice thawing and freezing alternately. The climate in Lijin, near the sea downstream, is colder than upstream. Recently, the weather suddenly warmed, and the ice upstream thawed. Giant ice floes, several zhang in size, swept down the river like an avalanche. Seventy li from the sea, the ice had not yet thawed. The giant ice floes accumulated and could not move down, causing the river water to rise. Zhang Lianjia, the director of the River Affairs Bureau, personally inspected the downstream on the 5th and returned to the bureau on the 7th. On the 7th, 8th, and 9th, the weather suddenly turned cold again, and the river ice re-froze to above Luokou, while there were still unfrozen areas in Luokou and Qinghezhen below, where the ice floes accumulated and could not move down, causing the river water to rise another eight chi. The dikes on both sides of the river were only one chi above the water. The dangerous works at Wangzaojia and Jizi stayed downstream, racing against the clock to prevent the danger, but the ground was frozen like stone, making it impossible to obtain earth. The weather was cold, and the water was cold, and the ice floes were too large. Those who were rushing to the rescue could not get into the water and dared not get close. According to the old regulations of the Qing Dynasty, river affairs personnel could be exempted from punishment for ice floe overflow in the Yellow River, and it is for this reason. The dangerous situation this time is unprecedented. Director Zhang Lianjia went downstream again yesterday to supervise the rescue efforts. The emergency telegrams from various places are recorded as follows: (1) To Zhang Jun, Director of the Jinan River Affairs Bureau: It is hoped that you will understand the song telegram. According to Xu Desheng, the head of the first section in the north, the Jiang Fan chief reported that the river water has risen one chi since winter, a total of five chi. New small embankments are still leaking. The engineering section chief of the Liao Work Committee, Zhang Shi, is on-site to take charge of everything. He immediately supervises the Fan chief to lead soldiers and civilians to rush to protect and block with straw. Unexpectedly, a leak occurred not far from the material factory to the west of the West Dam. The water was turbulent. Because the ground was frozen like stone, it was impossible to obtain soil. At noon on the winter day, it overflowed more than eight zhang. When Jiang Fan chief met with Zhang Gu, he first set up a method to rescue and protect. According to the urgent telegram from Wei Shen, the river water fell three chi from Dong Hai to Jiang You. In the afternoon of that day, Wang, the magistrate of Fan County, brought Zhong Lian chief and others to Liao to meet with Zhang Gu to discuss the work on the Zizhi day. First block the west mouth, then block the east mouth. In addition to ordering Liu Fan chief Jiuxing to assist, he will also clamp the river from Jiang Mao to Zhishi, and the water rose four chi and two cun. I only stopped knowing this morning, etc. Based on this, in addition to the urgent telegram to Zhong Lian chief Xu sub-section chief and others to speed up the method of blocking the mouth and report the preparation situation at any time, Li He Dian Chen, please ask for your appraisal, Chief Chen Wenmo, knocking You. (2) Chen Wenmo, Chief of the Shilibu Upstream Section: I know the Yuyou telegram. According to the report, the Liao West Dam overflowed more than eight zhang to the west, and new small embankments leaked. Wang, the magistrate of Fan County, took Zhong Lian chief to Liao and agreed with Zhang Gu that Zizhi day will start work, first blocking the west mouth and then blocking the east mouth. Based on this, it is appropriate to rush to prepare for blocking the Liao Work Ling Fan overflow. However, in the cold weather, hasty blocking may not be stable. You, the chief of the general section, went to work in person on the day to handle it appropriately, and report the engineering situation at any time as necessary. Director Zhang Lianjia Gengyin.

<h3>Records of Bandit Suppression in Henan Province</h3>
<p>▲ Sixth Division Vigorously Attacks Long-Time Ferocious Bandits</p>
<p>▲ More Than Two Thousand Hostages Rescued</p>
<p>A dispatch from Xuchang reports that Zhao Guantao, Commander of the Sixth Division, concurrently serving as Director of the Third Pacification Zone of Henan, immediately dispatched his troops to various locations for garrison duty based on the severity of the bandit situation, and had already completed the deployments. Unexpectedly, Zhang Tietou, a bandit leader who had long entrenched himself in Taikang, led several thousand men, fully equipped with firearms and ammunition, intending to operate within the pacification area of the Sixth Division, kidnapping people for ransom everywhere, tearing up tickets, and setting fires. Any villages they passed through were completely looted. On the 28th of last month, they suddenly intruded into the northern border of Xuchang. Upon hearing the news, the people of the entire county were terrified. Zhao Guantao, the director of the pacification zone, believed that this band of bandits could not be spared a severe suppression. He immediately ordered the independent brigade under his command, led by Wang Yunshan, to dispatch a regiment under Si Yugui to intercept them, using a rescued hostage as a guide. They encountered the bandits northwest of Chenlou in Xiaogongzhai and immediately opened fire. The bandits, numbering several thousand, resisted stubbornly, leading to a fierce battle lasting seven hours. Over four hundred bandits were killed and twenty-four were captured alive. The bandit forces were unable to withstand the assault and fled in disarray to the northwest. On the spot, over one hundred and thirty mules, horses, cattle, and donkeys, more than fifty miscellaneous rifles, over thirty fake flags, and more than two thousand hostages were seized. The regiment, while ordering the troops to pursue and track down the fleeing bandits, also escorted the captured prisoners, mules, horses, cattle, and donkeys to the Xuchang Pacification Headquarters. Commander Zhao then instructed personnel from the division to work with the Xuchang County Government Public Security Bureau to investigate the hometowns and circumstances of the kidnapped hostages and to make proper arrangements for their overnight stay. The next day, they were given dry rations and travel expenses and sent back to their respective hometowns. The total number included 414 from Luyi, 401 from Chenzhou, 352 from Yanling, 304 from Xihua, 169 from Fugou, 92 from Linying, 8 from Xuchang, 4 from Qi County, and 3 from Xiangcheng. Various public groups and organizations in Xuchang, recognizing that Commander Zhao's arrival in Xuchang and swift action to suppress the long-standing bandits marked a significant achievement, specially entrusted Zheng Kanghou, the magistrate of Xuchang County, to host a banquet in celebration. Magistrate Zheng, acting as chairman, rose to give a speech during the banquet, stating that after the esteemed division assumed command of the Third Pacification Zone of Henan, it immediately dispersed a large band of bandits and rescued over two thousand hostages, setting a new record since the suppression of bandits in Henan began. Furthermore, the soldiers of the esteemed division were disciplined and caused no alarm wherever they went, serving as a model for the military. He, as the magistrate, represented the people of the county in offering a toast to express their gratitude. Commander Zhao then rose to respond, stating that since he began leading troops, he had always advocated the principle of "strict suppression of bandits and absolute non-disturbance of the people." However, he emphasized that to completely eradicate local bandits, the political sector must organize rural reforms, and the people must promptly report any suspicious activities. Since he had assumed the position of Director of the Pacification Zone, he would do everything in his power to protect the people of the region and ensure their safety and security.</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>News of Bandit Suppression Near Zhangyan: Zhang Rubi, a battalion commander of the 30th Regiment of the Fifth Division of the Lu Army stationed in Songjiang, led his troops to Jinshan to suppress bandits the other day. The county Public Security Bureau also sent Inspector Yang Shijie along with them. It is now learned that after Battalion Commander Zhang arrived in Jinshan, he, along with Shi, the director of the Jinshan County Public Security Bureau, and Yang, the inspector of the Songjiang Public Security Bureau, each led their troops and at night detected traces of bandits gathering near Zhangyan. Battalion Commander Zhang ordered an encirclement and suppression. Director Shi and Inspector Yang each guarded one side, forming a pincer movement. The bandits landed and resisted with machine guns. Battalion Commander Zhang and Inspector Yang led the soldiers and bravely advanced, but they were outnumbered and almost surrounded by the bandits. After several hours, the bandits began to flee.

After an examination by the county coroner, the corpse was placed in a coffin, sealed, and put up for identification. At that time, rumors spread that the corpse was Shen Guanjin, murdered by bandits. His family, upon hearing the news, inquired about everything from the coroner, believed that the corpse's appearance and clothing were similar to Guanjin's, and claimed it from the county. It was confirmed to be Guanjin's body. The family members carried the body back, changed the coffin, and held a funeral. They also requested the county government to strictly apprehend the bandits involved in this case and bring them to justice.</p>

<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Postponement of the Implementation of the New Pawnshop Regulations: The pawnshop associations in various counties of Jiangsu Province have repeatedly appealed to the provincial government regarding the case of overdue redemption fees after the New Year, but have not received approval. Most of the capital of pawnshops throughout the province is less than 100,000 yuan, and the actual interest charged is often less than six months. Although the nominal monthly interest rate is two percent, after deducting occupancy, unsalable goods, and all expenses, the net profit is only between five and six percent. With increasing expenses, further reductions in revenue would make it impossible to maintain operations. Therefore, on the 5th of this month, representatives of pawnshop associations from various counties went to the provincial capital to submit a petition, which was accepted by the provincial authorities. They were allowed to postpone the implementation and were scheduled to hold a meeting of pawnshop associations from the entire province in Suzhou on January 15th to provide further encouragement. However, the county government had already received an order from the Construction Department to instruct pawnshops to implement the new regulations and had issued a public notice. Yesterday, the County Chamber of Commerce, considering that the current time is during the winter season and the end of the year, when pawnshops should be redeeming more and pawning less, stated that overdue redemption fees are currently of little consequence. Based on the provincial government's approval to postpone the implementation, the Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the county government requesting that it not urge pawnshops too much until the provincial pawnshop association has held its meeting in order to maintain the pawnshop business.</p>
<p>The Outcome of the Prostitution Case Involving a Police Officer: Zhou Runshi, an investigator from the Civil Affairs Department's police affairs department, was accused by Shen Xiang of soliciting prostitution and abducting his concubine Zhou Xingzhen. After the county government transferred the relevant witnesses in the case to the county court, Zhou Runshi, who was in custody, hired lawyer Zhou Shuijin to submit a petition to the court, arguing that soliciting prostitution does not constitute a criminal offense but only involves personal morality and should only be subject to administrative punishment. He further argued that there was no suspicion of abduction and requested an impartial investigation and acquittal. After receiving the petition, the county court summoned the plaintiff Shen Xiang, his mother Ms. Yu, his wife Ms. Yu, En Rui, a member of the third branch of the Public Security Bureau, and the defendants in custody, Zhou Runshi, Zhou Xingzhen, Wang Lihong, and Wang Chongxi, for questioning by prosecutor Zhu Zonghai. After a lengthy investigation, prosecutor Zhu announced in court that the abduction part of the case would not be prosecuted, and the prostitution part was a violation of police regulations and would be transferred to the Public Security Bureau for sentencing. The plaintiffs Shen Xiang and Ms. Yu were dismissed. Zhou Runshi, Zhou Xingzhen, Wang Lihong, and Wang Chongxi were temporarily returned to custody to await punishment by the Public Security Bureau. Qin Enrui was released on bail. After the verdict, the plaintiff Shen Xiang declared in court that he was dissatisfied and argued vehemently. The defendant Zhou Runshi also stated in court that since the plaintiff's accusations had been dismissed, the plaintiff should be punished for false accusation and defamation. Prosecutor Zhu ordered a separate lawsuit to be filed. Thus, the scandalous case of a police officer soliciting prostitution came to an end.</p>
<p>Temporary Suspension of Self-Organized Feast Donation Collection: The County Party and Government Consolidation Committee, based on a letter from the third district branch transferring a request to the county government to abolish the education donation for self-organized feasts for weddings and funerals, immediately forwarded the letter to the county government. The county government, also based on a report from Hu Zhongfang, the district chief of the fifth district, regarding Feng Ziyuan, who was collecting the feast education donation, was collecting in violation of regulations, submitted the matter to the 77th county administrative meeting. It was decided that this self-organized feast donation should not be collected without the approval of the Finance Department, and the county magistrate instructed the finance department to direct the collection director to comply.</p>
<p>Silk Factory Female Worker Commits Suicide for Love: Chen Afu, also known as Chen Xiaomao, the owner of a southern goods store in Chenming Bridge, outside the South Gate of this county, and resident of Xiadian Bridge in Jingyun City, second district, fell in love with Xi Mei, a female worker in the silk sorting section of the nearby Yongtai Silk Factory last summer. They engaged in secret affairs more than once, and their love was as deep as that of a married couple. Recently, Chen Afu suffered from inguinal hernia typhus, and his illness was severe and unresponsive to medication. He died the other day. Upon hearing the news, his lover Xi Mei was heartbroken. She went to the Chen family to attend the funeral and immediately developed a sense of world-weariness. Yesterday, she walked to the nearby river and committed suicide by drowning.

<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>The Bandit Situation in the County: The county government received an order from the Jiangsu Pacification Supervisory Office to investigate the bandit situation throughout the county.

The report stated that Jiangyin is situated with its northern boundary adjacent to the Yangtze River, with Xia Gang to the west extending directly north to the river, and with the area from Lupu Port directly north to the Jianghuang Earth and Stone Village area, and with the area from the Peach Blossom Port extending directly north to the Jiang Port. The bays and ports are complex and easy for bandits to use for concealment. Therefore, in areas such as Huangtu Earth and Stone Village, Jiajiatou, and the east and west Zhuang areas, bandit leaders such as Gao Xiaosheng and Yang Yaoda were causing disturbances. Bandit leader Yu Abing was executed, and bandit leaders Zhu Awu, Shen Awen, Xia Peizhi, and Liu Hongxi were captured. The remaining bandits fled north across the Yangtze River, and the bandit situation was slightly reduced. In the northeast, there are mountains and ports such as Changshan, Xiangshan, Zhangqi Mountain, Panlong Mountain, Huangshan Port, Baisha Port, Wushan Port, Zhangjia Port, Hucao Port, and Duan Shan Port, which are intertwined and also easy for bandits to hide in. Therefore, in areas such as the southern foothills of Changshan, Anquan Village, Qianjia Chang, Renjia Qiao, Xinjing Bridge, Baisha Bridge, to Zhanwen Bridge, Ergongdian, and Yunting, bandit leaders Zheng Chaoyong, Jiao Shaohong, and Xiang Xuzhuang, and bandit leaders Lu Zhanglin, Qin Qiyun, and Xu Haishan were causing disturbances. Bandit leaders Chen Weiwu, Fan Jinquan, and Chen Latong have been sentenced. Bandit Wang Ziming killed himself, and bandit Tao Jigen and Tang Awen were shot dead. Bandit Liu Ziwen and Wang Shaowen were captured. The remaining bandits also fled successively across the Yangtze River, and the bandit situation was also slightly reduced. The southern part of the county is inland, and there are fewer bandits. After the execution of bandit Zhou A Kui, the situation in the western townships has also become slightly more stable. This is the general situation.</p>

<h3>City Police Chief Chen Xizeng Assumes Office Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ Summons all Staff for Instructions</p>
<p>▲ Separate Swearing-in Ceremony to be Scheduled</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Xizeng, the newly appointed Director of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, assumed his duties at the bureau yesterday morning at 10:00 a.m. upon the order of the Municipal Government, in view of the urgent winter defense period and local security. A separate swearing-in ceremony will be held at a later date, inviting guests from all sectors to observe. A summary of yesterday's handover proceedings is detailed below:</p>
<p>▲ Handover Proceedings: Director Chen, accompanied by Chief Inspector Wang Yufen, arrived at the bureau at 10:00 a.m. yesterday morning. Prior to their arrival, the Police Brigade and all staff of the Public Security Bureau, along with the military band, were assembled in the bureau's courtyard, playing music to welcome them. The new director was led to the director's office by Section Chief Huang Guangdou and others, where he received the seal of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau and the handover inventory. After a brief deployment, he summoned all staff for instructions. Those who came to the Public Security Bureau yesterday morning to congratulate Mr. Chen included Secretary-General Yu Hongjun, representing the Municipal Government, as well as Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Ye Huijun, Wen Lanting, Tang Naikang, Xu Peihuang, Zhu Zhongzhou, Tan Shaoliang, and many others.</p>
<p>▲ Director's Address: "Brothers, I am a revolutionary soldier. I am honored to be appointed to take charge of public security in this city and to meet all of you. Many of the officers, both senior and junior, within and outside the bureau, are former colleagues and comrades who have shared hardships. Some are classmates and old friends, and some are new comrades whom I have not yet met. However, since we are all serving in the same organization, it is important that each person be loyal to their duty. Whether we knew each other before or not is irrelevant. There should be no distinctions or boundaries. The government selects people based on talent. I will treat everyone, regardless of whether they are new or old comrades, whether I know them or not, based on their job responsibilities, assessing their performance, and judging their merits. The duty of public security personnel is like the red blood cells in the human body, constantly working every moment to ensure public safety. You must have a spirit of sacrifice, sacrificing personal happiness and tranquility to preserve public safety, so that you can be worthy of the Party, the country, and society, and be considered to have fulfilled your duties. In officialdom, it is common for subordinates to be anxious and even seek connections to secure their positions whenever a superior changes. I believe that if you want to know your own status, you should only ask yourself whether you have fulfilled your responsibilities and whether your performance is good. If your performance is good, even if no one speaks for you, I will trust you greatly. If your performance is poor or non-existent, even thousands of recommendations from wealthy people will not be tolerated. I do not care whether you have a personal relationship with me, or whether we have shared hardships, and I do not distinguish between those appointed by the previous director and those appointed by the current director. I serve the Party and the country, and I only recognize the Party and the country. I do not recognize the faces of wealthy people. Personal relationships are personal, and I will never allow them to interfere with public duties. I hope everyone will recognize their responsibilities, work together, and put aside all personal gains and losses, as well as old habits, in order to be worthy of the Party, the country, and society. Then you will be my good friends and loyal comrades. Governing does not require many words, but relies entirely on action. I will use my own eyes to see your merits and demerits in practice. No matter how nice someone speaks, I will never rely on hearsay. We are currently in the winter defense period, and the responsibility of public security is even more important than usual. Maintaining social security is our sole duty, and fulfilling our responsibilities is an opportunity for everyone to be assessed. As for all superficial formalities, I will not speak of them, nor is it necessary to speak of them. I hope to work with everyone to invigorate our spirits and work together."</p>
<p>▲ Inauguration Notice: Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to Order No. 624 of the Municipal Government, Chen Xizeng is hereby appointed as the Director of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau.

<h3>Dredging of the Wusong River Commences Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ Shanghai River Bureau Receives Commission Letter from Mayor Zhang</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that the proposal to dredge the Suzhou River has been advocated for twelve years. Due to various reasons, it has not been implemented for a long time. Until today, the Shanghai River Bureau has been commissioned by the Special Committee for Dredging this River to start construction. It is scheduled to be completed in six years from the mouth of the Suzhou River to Yujidun. The bureau received a commission letter from Mayor Zhang on Monday and will begin work today (11th). A reporter met with the Chief Engineer of the Shanghai River Bureau yesterday, who stated that the scope of the dredging project is currently limited to the Shanghai city boundary, starting from Yujidun, approximately five miles west of the Bund, to the mouth of the Suzhou River. It is planned to start construction near the mouth of the river. Two dredgers have been dispatched, one at the mouth of the Outer White Bridge and one between the Outer White Bridge and Zhaofeng Road, to dredge in sections. The dredged mud will be transported to the bureau's mud pumping station downstream of the Huangpu River to fill shallows. In addition, small crab claw-style dredgers will need to be added to dredge the upper reaches. They are currently being built at the Jiangnan Shipyard and are expected to be completed and put into use around this autumn. The dredging depth is planned to be six feet deep even at the lowest water level, so as not to affect the safety of the river bank. However, this project is quite large. According to the current plan, it will take six years to complete.</p>
<h3>Guangji Returned to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>

A passenger named Mr. Li, who is familiar with the reporter, recounted the truth of the Guangji ship's discovery of pirates, which is worthy of publication. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Bandits Mix into Ship: When the Guangji ship left Wenzhou on the morning of the 6th, the bandits had already disguised themselves as passengers and mixed into the cabins. The bandit leader was very young, only 26 years old. He arrived on the ship in advance and booked cabin No. 9. He was wearing a camel绒 robe and carrying a leather bag. When the ship set sail, the crew did not pay attention. After the anchor was raised, the bandit leader, under the alias of Hu Acun, went to and from various cabins, carefully inspecting the luggage of the passengers, seemingly assessing their wealth. A passenger saw that his eyes were shining brightly and he was walking back and forth suspiciously. A passenger secretly reported to the captain and asked him to pay attention to this person's movements. Sure enough, he was seen signaling to passengers in the steerage. The captain determined that he was undoubtedly a bandit and reported it to the police for arrest, and the case was solved.</p>
<p>▲ Marine Police Search and Seize Weapons: The captain remained calm and sailed to Huanghuaguan outside the port of Wenzhou and dropped anchor. The Chao Wu warship of the Marine Police Department was berthed there. The captain reported to the captain of the warship and asked him to send police to search. The Chao Wu warship immediately sent ten armed marine police officers to board the ship. First, they searched Hu Acun in cabin No. 9. At first, the bandit leader refused to allow the leather bag to be searched. The marine police then used a bayonet to pry open the leather bag, revealing twelve brand-new Browning pistols. The marine police officers immediately subdued the bandit Hu. The bandit wanted to take out a gun to open fire, but it was too late. A pistol was also found on the bandit's body. He was immediately escorted to the warship, and police officers were sent to guard the cabin entrances, preventing anyone from escaping, as further searches were required.</p>
<p>▲ Twelve More Bandits Apprehended: After the bandit leader arrived on the warship, he was interrogated by the captain and confessed that there were a total of twenty accomplices who boarded the ship to rob. The marine police boarded the Guangji ship for a second time and searched the steerage cabin one by one. Fifteen suspicious persons were found and escorted to the warship for further interrogation. Among them, twelve were identified by the bandit leader as accomplices. Three people proved that they were passengers. The captain detained the bandits and released the passengers back to the ship.</p>
<p>▲ Confession of Pirate Organization: Hu Acun was the leader of the bandits. Two or three other leaders were also arrested. Interrogated by the captain, they confessed that there were four more bandits on the ship, but they could not be identified, or they may not have boarded the ship. They also claimed that this robbery was carefully planned. More than 100 accomplices and six bandit ships had been dispatched 100 miles away from Huanghuaguan in Wenzhou waters, preparing to take action on the ship tonight and unload the stolen goods there. They also confessed that they planned to rob not only the Guangji ship, but also other ships going to Shanghai, Taiwan, and Wenzhou one by one. They hoped to rob 300,000 yuan from the Guangji ship.</p>
<p>▲ Raid on Bandit Nest in Wenzhou: On the morning of the 7th, the marine police escorted the third bandit leader back to Wenzhou from the Guangji ship. The security team boarded the ship at the port again for a search, but found no trace of the four bandits, knowing that they had not yet boarded the ship. They then took the bandit to the bandit's nest mentioned by him, in a folk house in Dongmen. The security team went to search, but the four bandits had escaped. Only an old woman was found, and a wooden shell gun was found. They were immediately taken to the Fourth Command of the Wenzhou Security Command for interrogation. The bandit was then escorted to the Chao Wu warship for joint handling.</p>
<p>▲ Guangji Protected to Shanghai: The Guangji sailed from Wenzhou to Shanghai via Huanghuaguan on the 8th, but dared not sail because there were more than 100 pirates waiting on the sea. The Chao Wu warship was requested to send troops to escort them. The captain selected seven capable police officers with machine guns and rifles to board the ship to escort them to Shanghai. They arrived in Shanghai safely yesterday. All the passengers and their families were deeply grateful to the organizers of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company for their effective handling. The passengers went to the bureau to express their gratitude after arriving in Shanghai. The ship will resume its voyage to Wenzhou today.</p>
<h3>Report of the Canadian Trade Mission After Returning Home</h3>
<p>▲ Submitted to the Canadian Government by the Canadian Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>When the Canadian Trade Mission visited Shanghai last year, Chinese groups and individuals expressed their sincere hope that the harsh restrictions on the entry of Orientals would be lifted and the treatment of overseas Chinese would be improved. According to news from Ottawa, after the mission returned to Canada, it proposed in its report to the Canadian government that the government study whether the regulations governing the entry of merchants and tourists from the Far East could be amended in order to enhance friendship between Canada and the Japanese and Chinese nations and facilitate the development of commerce. In addition, (1) it requested the government to increase the number of trade commissioners stationed in the Far East, especially in northern China, where there is currently no special commissioner; (2) the cost of telegraphs between the Far East and Canada is too high, which hinders commerce, and the government is requested to study the possibility of establishing wireless telephones to reduce merchants' costs; (3) it requested the Department of Commerce and the Department of Finance to investigate the separation of goods indirectly shipped from the Far East to Canada and to find ways to encourage direct trade in order to reduce the rise and fall of trade between Japan and China and Canada. The above four points are all more related to the Far East. It is reported that this report was formally submitted to the Canadian government by the Canadian Chamber of Commerce on January 22nd.</p>
<h3>Wu Jingxiong Internally Appointed as Head of the Chinese Affairs Department of the Public Concession</h3>
<p>▲ Wu Visited Mayor Zhang Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>▲ Expected to be Approved by the Board of Directors Next Week</p>
<p>The addition of a Head of the Chinese Affairs Department to the Shanghai Public Concession is likely to become a reality. The person selected is Wu Jingxiong, former President of the Provisional Court. Mr. Wu visited Mayor Zhang at the Municipal Government yesterday morning to discuss this matter for about an hour. It is heard that more than forty or fifty people have submitted voluntary applications for the position of Head of the Chinese Affairs Department, but Mr. Wu was not among them. The Public Concession has taken this into consideration. Now, Chinese Directors Yu Qiaqing and others are recommending him, so it is no longer a problem. It is expected that this case will be formally approved by the Public Concession Board of Directors next week. A reporter from this newspaper specifically interviewed Mr. Wu yesterday, and Mr. Wu did not deny it.</p>
<h3>Navigation Public Bonds to be Issued Soon</h3>
<p>▲ Talk After Yu Qiaqing Returned to Shanghai</p>
<p>Navigation industry leader Yu Qiaqing went to Nanjing the night before last for the navigation public bonds and returned to Shanghai yesterday morning. According to him, the bond issuance method has been decided by the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Finance through consultation. In the future, a committee will be organized to be responsible for the safekeeping and distribution. The number of committee members will be from seven to nine, with one each from the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Communications, the Municipal Government, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the rest will be representatives from the navigation industry. The issuance regulations have also been drafted and sent to the Legislative Yuan for review and approval, and will be announced after approval. It is expected that the final decision will be made within three or four days and the bonds can be issued. The face value of the bonds will be from 6 million to 10 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk Industry Business Tax Approved for Reduction</h3>
<p>▲ Telegram Report from Silk Relief Association</p>
<p>The China National Silk Relief Association sent a telegram yesterday announcing the success of reducing the business tax on the silk industry: It is known to all silk industry groups in various provinces and cities that when various provinces are implementing business taxes, the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Finance first proposed a tax rate of 30 per mille for the silk industry. Later, during the meeting, the representatives of the silk industry strongly argued for a reduction to 15 per mille. This exceeded the highest rate of 2 per mille for business tax collection in various provinces promulgated by the Executive Yuan by nearly eight times. Not only is it difficult for businesses to bear, but it also regards silk as a luxury item that should be banned. This is contrary to the Central Government's intention to promote domestic silk weaving. If this is not contested, it is feared that various provinces will follow suit, and the future of the silk industry will decline and eventually disappear. Hundreds of thousands of farmers and silkworms in Jiangsu and Zhejiang will lose their source of livelihood, and the clothing materials of our country's 400 million compatriots will rely entirely on imported goods. The relationship is so great that we cannot bear to say it all. As expected, the tax rate in Jiangsu Province is also the same as that of Zhejiang Province at 15 per mille, while Fujian Province even follows the initial draft of Zhejiang Province, stipulating it as 30 per mille. Even compared to the lowest tax rate in Hubei Province, it is still 5 per mille. Therefore, the silk industry in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai, for the sake of the survival of the domestic silk industry, was forced to push forward and publicly elected representatives to go to the central government and various ministries and courtyards to petition. Yan Song followed Luo Qinghua, Zhu Mouxian, Zheng Bing, Pan Xiangsheng, Jiang Linshu, Shen Zicha, Wu Xingcha, Lou Fengshao, Cai Liangyou, Lin Zhaorong, and other representatives, rushing to Nanjing and Beijing to explain to the authorities the reasons why the silk industry must reduce taxes. Fortunately, the authorities adopted them and promised to consider them. Today, we respectfully read the Executive Yuan's notice that the request of the silk industry that the business tax rate collected by various provinces should not exceed 2 per mille to protect it is in line with the Central Government's previous approval of the relief of the silk weaving industry and should be approved. We deeply appreciate the Executive Yuan's virtue of maintaining domestic production and caring for farmers and merchants. We are deeply grateful and share the same feelings. Therefore, we specially send a telegram to inform you and hope that you will note it. If the business tax rate on the silk industry in various provincial and municipal governments still exceeds 2 per mille, you should request corrections at any time to emphasize government orders. The reason why this tax reduction was achieved is due to the Central Government's willingness to accept public opinion and benefit silk merchants, and the representatives of the silk industry in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai did not hesitate to travel and appeal, and the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Secretary of the Compilation Committee, Mr. Yan Esheng, took the lead in drafting and publicizing as much as possible, so that the feelings of the people could be conveyed and the government authorities could be moved. We hereby inform you of this and commend the hard work. Chairman Yan Song of the China National Silk Relief Association kowtows.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry Permits Exemption of Tobacco Industry Inspection Fees</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Industry yesterday approved the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce's request to the Nanyang Huacheng and Eryan factories to transport tobacco leaves to Shandong, where the Qingdao Inspection Bureau collected inspection fees. The electric request for review and approval and the order to exempt fees to maintain the tobacco industry, etc., were approved, saying: "The electric message has been received. Commodity inspection is related to improving commodity reputation and supervising production improvement. It is of utmost importance and a responsibility of the Ministry, which is difficult to stop. For the sake of both inspection administration and commercial hardship, the Qingdao Commodity Inspection Bureau has been ordered, except for thoroughly inspected cotton and commodities specially approved by the Ministry, to exempt all non-export commodities from inspection fees to show consideration. You should be informed immediately and also inform others accordingly."</p>
<h3>Electric Request to Revise the Business Tax Rate in Jiangsu Province</h3>
<p>▲ National Federation of Chambers of Commerce Sends Electric Message to the National Government to Order the Provincial Government to Reconsider</p>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce sent a public telegram to the National Government's Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Industry yesterday, stating: "Recently, the Jiangsu Yixing County Chamber of Commerce's electric message stated that the business tax rate implemented in Jiangsu Province exceeds the key points set by the Ministry by a large amount. After the Zhejiang business tax rate was revealed in the newspapers, various industries in Shanghai have been appealing for a reduction in the tax rate. Now, the Jiangsu tax rate is even higher than the Zhejiang tax rate. Furthermore, the match industry has already collected a unified tax and is included in the business tax. Tobacco and alcohol have license fees, but the business tax rate is included in the brewing industry. Domestic silk and satin are forcibly listed as luxury goods and charged the highest tax rate. All these repeated and harsh details not only overwhelm the businesses but also greatly affect the livelihoods of ordinary people. Arbitrary taxation is a great loss to the country's original intention to resolutely abolish tariffs. If various provinces follow suit, the key points set by the Ministry will become mere formalities, and the suffering of the businesses will be extreme. We hereby send this electric message to your association, hoping that you will jointly fight for this. We pray that you will promptly order the Jiangsu Provincial Government to seriously review and properly revise it, so that consideration can still be given to the people amidst the resistance. President Bei Kanghou of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce respectfully kowtows."</p>
<h3>Request to Exempt or Reduce Business Tax</h3>
<p>▲ Qian Shops: The Municipal Committee for the Study of Business Tax Regulations telegraphed the Ministry of Finance yesterday, requesting exemption of the business tax on Qian shops, stating: "Article 1 of the supplementary measures for the outline of business tax collection in various provinces stipulates that banks may be exempted from business tax in accordance with special companies. However, Qian shops, which also bear the responsibility of regulating social finance and do not use commodities as the object, are uniquely lacking in this. According to the principles of things, it seems to be unequal. We dare to submit an electric request to the Ministry, praying that the Ministry will approve the exemption of the business tax on Qian shops, which have a long history and similar business nature, in accordance with the tax exemption precedent for banks, in order to show support and conform to equality, for the sake of public convenience."</p>
<p>▲ Candle Industry: The Candle Industry Association sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, requesting that the Ministry of Finance forward it to the Jiangsu and Zhejiang provincial governments for correction. The reason is that the output of the candle industry can rise in time, resist foreign goods, save profits, and help the lower classes and promote the strength of the people. The government should not have time to reward and promote it, so how can it increase the tax rate and curb its development? The Ministry's outline of business tax stipulates that the maximum rate shall not exceed 2 per mille. It is understandable that the highest tax is levied on consumer goods. Even the unnecessary needs are not taxed at a rate of 5 per mille or 10 per mille, but only at a rate of 2 per mille, which is considered the highest standard. The Ministry is considerate of businesses. We request that your association forward it to the Ministry of Finance to complete the virtuous policy and quickly issue a sub-consultation to the Jiangsu and Zhejiang provincial governments for correction."</p>
<p>▲ Wine Industry: Yesterday, the Wine and Baijiu Industry Association submitted a report to the Ministry of Finance, the Jiangsu Department of Finance, the Shanghai Municipal Government, and a letter to the Municipal Committee for the Study of Tax Regulations on the matter of business tax, stating: "Recently, we read in the newspapers that the Jiangsu Province has promulgated the Provisional Business Tax Regulations, which stipulates that the brewing industry will be taxed at 10 per mille. Does the term "brewing industry" refer to wineries, or does it refer to shops that specialize in selling oil, soy sauce, and wine, which are commonly referred to as "brewing industry"? Both types of shops have already been taxed by the central government for tobacco and alcohol business licenses. Furthermore, wine merchants do not produce wine themselves but transport it from wineries and resell it to retail shops, which specialize in selling oil, soy sauce, and wine. The same goods have already been taxed three times by the central government's license tax. If the brewing industry is included in the local business tax, it would be like adding a bed on top of a bed and collecting taxes repeatedly, which is seriously inconsistent with the Ministry's outline. The burden on merchants at all levels is unbearable. Domestic wines are likely to be greatly affected, which is contrary to the late Premier Sun Yat-sen's emphasis on people's livelihood. The matter concerns the livelihood of wine merchants. Therefore, we specially submit a request to correct and remove the brewing industry listed in the Jiangsu business tax. When formulating the business tax in this city, please exempt the brewing industry to avoid duplication and maintain the Ministry's regulations."</p>
<h3>Oil and Bean Cake Industry Requests Exemption from Special Tax</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Miscellaneous Grains, Oil, and Bean Cake Trade Association yesterday telegraphed the Nanjing Ministry of Finance, saying: "Respectfully to Minister Song: We recently heard that oil and beans are to be designated as special taxes. Although this has not yet been formally announced, we are quite concerned. We believe that oil and beans are daily necessities and cannot be compared to luxury goods. After the surtax reduction, they should be exempt from taxation. Even if taxes are to be levied, they should be specially reduced. Moreover, the customs already levies export taxes on these items. If they are designated as special taxes, double taxation would be excessive. Merchants are happy about the surtax reduction, but they would be burdened by additional taxes, which is not the government's intention to consider the hardships of businesses. Furthermore, the special tax on cotton yarn only applies to yarn, not to cotton cloth, because they are considered one type of material. Oil comes from beans, and oil and beans are essentially one type, like mother and child. This is similar to the cotton yarn and cloth example, and they should not be taxed separately. As the tax regulations are being discussed, any oversights could easily lead to excessive taxation. If implementation is hindered, and changes are then made, it would damage the government's credibility. Therefore, this association respectfully requests that the Ministry exempt oil and beans from special taxes, in addition to the export taxes already levied by customs. If this is not possible, we request that the cotton yarn and cloth tax example be followed, taxing only one item and not both, and granting a special reduction within that one item to reduce the burden on the people's livelihood and ease the difficulties of businesses. This would be greatly appreciated. Respectfully, Ye Zengming, Chairman of the Shanghai Chinese Merchants Miscellaneous Grains, Oil, and Bean Cake Trade Association, bows."</p>
<h3>Yarn Factories Request Transportation of Cotton Stored in Shaanxi and Henan</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Yarn Mill Association telegraphed the Ministry of Industry, Nanjing, yesterday: "Respectfully to Minister of Industry: Since last spring, cotton from Shaanxi and Henan has not been transported out. Reports indicate that there are still 1.4 million dan stored. The cotton harvest in the southeastern provinces has been very poor, and yarn mills rely on foreign cotton. Recently, prices have been extremely high, and there is a shortage of raw materials. We earnestly request that you instruct the authorities in Shaanxi and Henan to find ways to facilitate transportation, and that the railway bureau adds trains to transport the stored cotton out by land. This would allow yarn mills to purchase less foreign cotton, preventing the outflow of money. It would also allow Shaanxi to exchange cotton for food, alleviating famine. This would be a great benefit in several ways. We respectfully request your prompt implementation. Respectfully, the Chinese Yarn Mill Association."</p>
<h3>Customs' Combined Collection of Liquor Tax is Difficult to Implement</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce previously sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance, requesting that the liquor tax bureau in the Chinese-controlled area be abolished and replaced with a one-time collection by customs to facilitate enforcement, prevent smuggling, and unify tax policies. Yesterday, the Ministry of Finance replied, saying: "This case was previously submitted by the Shanghai Liang Liquor Trade Association, represented by Huang Yuming. The proposed tax rate for liquor is 30% of the value, and 20 yuan per hundred jin for alcohol. This includes all liquor manufactured by foreigners or imitated by Chinese, as well as imported liquor. This liquor tax is a domestic consumption tax and is different from the customs duties on imported liquor and alcohol. The request to have customs collect the tax is difficult to implement. Regarding the prevention of alcohol smuggling, the former provincial Tobacco and Liquor Affairs Bureau also submitted a similar request, which was approved to establish an alcohol inspection station in Shanghai. Now, based on the previous request, we will instruct the Jiangsu Stamp Tax and Liquor Tax Bureau to investigate and deliberate and submit a reply. This reply is for the public association's record and will be sent to the Jiangsu Bureau."</p>
<h3>Postal Workers' Demands Reported Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union's request to the central government to maintain the original organization of the union and its demands for a housing subsidy of ten yuan have been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. It is now known that the union has contacted the authorities several times regarding the housing subsidy issue, but there have been no results. Postal workers are extremely angry and seem determined to achieve their goals. The union's petition and notice are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲Petition The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union petitions the Municipal Party Committee to forward to the central government to allow the original organization to be maintained, in order to strengthen the national revolutionary forces and benefit the postal service. The petition states: "Since the union followed the teachings of the late Premier and strived for revolution, it has been nearly seven years. The postal workers have been united and have been devoted to the mission of our party under the leadership of the union. During the Shanghai battle in 1928, they fought bravely against the Zhili-Lu warlords and were honored to sacrifice their lives to assist the progress of the national revolution. Since then, they have moved forward bravely and fearlessly, so that in the period of purification, the communists did not dare to exist in our post office. Looking back at the past work achievements, there is much to be proud of. However, the union does not dare to be complacent. At this time of national unrest, any hesitation would give reactionaries an opportunity to take advantage of the situation. Therefore, in all revolutionary movements under the leadership of our party, the union is determined to lead its postal workers to fight bravely and serve as a model for the people's movement, so that our party's policies can be implemented. No matter how many obstacles there may be, we will not give up. Last year, we opposed the loss of national rights in the Sino-German aviation contract, and our loud appeal shocked society and won public opinion, so that the unequal contract could be revised. Although we were resented by those in charge, we did our best to protect our national rights. As for the postal service itself, the union and its members love it more than their own families. For example, we assisted the government in recovering the postal rights held by foreign countries for more than 30 years. We supported the Premier's belief that the best examination system in China is the postal service's own examination system, and we abolished the document clerks and assistant clerks who had not passed the examination. We opposed the establishment of parallel agencies for the postal savings and remittance business, which wastes public funds. We demanded that those who controlled the post office and embezzled public funds be investigated. All of these efforts were aimed at eliminating all corruption and evil in the postal service, which has been painstakingly operated by our country. Not only is this praised by society as being reasonable and justified, but also by your Ministry and the Executive Committee of the Central Party Department, who have expressed their sympathy and concern. The union is a revolutionary group of postal workers, and it knows the situation best. We have no feelings of good or bad about any event, but only want to protect the postal service and do not want to see it in danger of bankruptcy, which would make us a laughing stock to foreign countries. In summary, the union has been loyal to the national revolution, politics, and the postal service. This has been clear and undeniable. The union hopes to strengthen its unity in the future to serve as a driving force for our party and as a powerful backing. Unexpectedly, news came that the Central Party Department intends to order the reorganization of postal workers' unions throughout the country in accordance with the Trade Union Law. The union was shocked and the public was in an uproar. Although it is still under consideration by the Central Party Department, the union cannot help but speak out. According to the Trade Union Law, the members of the union will be limited to postal workers below the rank of letter carrier. If this is carried out, the union, which has a long and glorious history, will lose its solid</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>solidarity and strength. To put it bluntly, a large revolutionary group of the people will be wiped out. This is probably not what our Central Party Department wants to see. Premier Sun Yat-sen earnestly instructed us to protect labor groups and develop their strength, and our party's previous declarations have also recognized that the people's revolutionary movement not only does not violate the interests of the national revolution, but also increases the strength of the national revolution, so that it can overthrow imperialism, warlords, and all domestic counter-revolutionary forces. Therefore, our party advocates that we must do our best to make the people's movement widespread. From this point of view, the strength of the people is being developed and not destroyed. Undoubtedly, the union does not dare to criticize the Central Party Department's move, but it is afraid that at a time when the revolution has not yet been completely successful, this will weaken the vigorous people's movement in China. At a time when we have not yet entered the period of construction internally and rely heavily on the support of the people externally, it is even more inappropriate to do this. In terms of the postal service, the union has always struggled against corrupt forces. Once these corrupt forces are dissolved, they will run rampant and be even more unscrupulous. The future of the postal service is unthinkable. Even if our postal workers want to protect it, they will not be able to. What the heart feels is dangerous, it is difficult to remain silent. We do not hesitate to risk death to state our case. We hope that you will forward to the Central Party Department and approve the maintenance of the original organization of the union and all postal workers' unions throughout the country, and request that a special trade union law be promulgated as soon as possible in accordance with the original organization of the union. The future of the national revolution and the future of the postal service depend on this. Respectfully submitted, the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Department, the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union, February 11, 1931.</p>
<p>▲Notice Shanghai Postal Workers' Union Notice No. 20 states: "Regarding the resolution of the Second Plenary Representatives' Conference on (1) striving to maintain the original organization of the union and (2) requesting a housing subsidy of ten yuan for all members, the union has been ordered to handle these two cases, and is working hard to implement them and actively strive for them. It has also decided to take steps to specifically handle these two cases. Regarding the first case, in addition to the unanimous support of friendly unions across the country and the joint publication of a declaration, the union has also submitted a petition to the Municipal Party Department to forward to the Central Party Department, stating the reasons and requesting approval to maintain the original organization of postal workers' unions across the country, and requesting the promulgation of a special trade union law as soon as possible in accordance with the original organization of the union. Regarding the second case, we have made every effort to proceed, studied the countermeasures day and night, and contacted the authorities several times, but the authorities have refused on the grounds of lack of sincerity. The public is resentful because, due to the relationship between gold and silver, rents have suddenly increased. This request is a must for our postal workers. We will not stop until we achieve our goal. In summary, public opinion is very sympathetic to these cases and has received support from all sides. However, we hope that all members will wait patiently for a solution during this period, follow all orders from the union, and unite as a backing for negotiations. This is very important. This is hereby notified. Shanghai Postal Workers' Union, February 11, 1931."</p>
<h3>Economic Demands of Postal Workers</h3>
<p>Recently, the cost of living in this city has been rising, and rents and prices have been increasing steadily. Postal workers' union members are finding it difficult to cope with the economic pressure. The representative conference has resolved to request a general promotion. It is reported that the union has requested this from the authorities.</p>
<h3>A Visit to the Belgenland</h3>
<p>The Red Star Line's world cruise ship Belgenland, carrying 350 tourists, arrived at Sanjiaoshui outside Wusong at 6:30 PM the night before last and anchored overnight. The tourists disembarked in groups to sightsee on the night before last and yesterday morning. Yesterday, the reporter was invited to visit the ship, along with 20 other people. The passenger launch departed from the Customs Pier at 1:30 PM and, after an hour and a half, approached the Belgenland. After climbing the steps, we were led by a guide to visit the smoking room and the dining room. Then we went to the gymnasium and the swimming pool, which had a Japanese garden and a dance hall. Finally, we visited the ship's newly installed sound movie and wireless telephone. The captain hosted us with tea and snacks, and we returned at 7:00 PM. The ship was built in 1923, is 697 feet long and 79 feet wide, and has a tonnage of 27,200 tons. It is on its seventh world cruise. It left Shanghai last night at 9:00 PM, heading south.</p>
<p>Another Maritime Accident Involving Jianghai Vessels</p>
<p>▲Stranding丨Engine Damage丨Collision▲</p>
<p>▲Xinningxing Stranded The Sanbei Company's Changjiang liner Xinningxing was carrying a large number of goods for export from Shanghai to Lian. The draft reached 12 feet. When sailing to the Baihushan section of the river upstream, the water level was receding, with only 9 feet. Xinningxing could not pass through the area and the ship ran aground. The captain tried to reverse the ship, but it was ineffective. They immediately sent a radio distress call. The Shanghai Bureau received the message and ordered the Hankou branch to send four tugs to tow the ship. However, the bottom of the ship was stuck in the sand. After a day and night of towing, it was still not towed out. Yesterday, the bureau sent another telegram to Hankou, ordering the Hankou Bureau to send two shallow-water vessels, Yian and Yang'an, to the Baihushan section of the river to transfer the goods from the Xinningxing to the four tugs to reduce the draft by one foot and then try to tow the ship.</p>
<p>Qinghe Escapes Danger The Jardine Matheson Company's Chongqing vessel Qinghe ran aground in the Fujiang River on the 26th of last month while sailing upstream from Yichang. At that time, it was attacked by bandits, creating an extremely dangerous situation. Fortunately, the rescue vessel sent from Hankou arrived and the British soldiers on the rescue vessel repelled the river bandits. The cargo inside the ship was unloaded at the grounding site, and the vessel was finally freed. Yesterday, the company received a telegram from Hankou stating that although the Qinghe had escaped danger, the hull had been damaged by the grounding. It is now being sailed back to Shanghai to enter the dock for major repairs. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai in two or three days.</p>
<p>▲Jianguo Loses Blades The China Merchants Bureau's Jianguo vessel entered shallow water near Anqing. When the captain reversed the ship, two of the rear propeller blades were broken, and the ship lost its ability to sail. The Anhui Bureau sent two small vessels to tow it out. The Shanghai Bureau received the report and requested that the Weidedao send a tugboat to the Changjiang River to tow the Jianguo back to Shanghai. It is unloading cargo today and tomorrow and will enter the factory for repairs.</p>
<p>▲French Postal Ship Incident The French Postal Ship Company's Baodao S vessel collided with the Japanese Nisaki Shipping Company's Goshumaru in the Akashi Bay, Hyogo Prefecture, Japan. Yesterday, the Shanghai office received a telegram from the ship stating that it was to rescue the Japanese ship and that the ship was taking responsibility for the disaster, causing it to not be able to arrive as scheduled. The date must be delayed by 24 hours. Because the postal ship cannot postpone the export date, the company has decided to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow. It will only stay in Shanghai for one day and will depart for France on Saturday.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Sea Vessels Suspend Service</h3>
<p>▲Tongyang Vessels Also Suspend Sailing</p>
<p>Six shipping companies operate on the coastal routes in eastern Zhejiang, such as Shanghai to Taizhou, Shipu, Zhoushan, Chuanshan, and other ports. Due to the end of the lunar year and a lack of cargo to load, the shipping companies decided yesterday to suspend service after the last vessel departs today, and to resume service on the third day of the lunar new year. In addition, the Shanghai Tongyang vessels have also decided to suspend sailing during the lunar new year under the pretext of repairing the vessels.</p>
<h3>Verdict on Fangbang Road Property Case</h3>
<p>▲Executive Yuan Upholds Ministry of Finance's Original Ruling</p>
<p>Xinshanghai News reports that the representatives of the Siming Guild Hall, Shen Xiangfu, the Huining Guild Hall, Yu Yanghan, and He Shaoji, Song Jingcheng, Zhang Cansheng, Zhang Zhongxuan, Zhou Rongkun, Yang Laogang, Xu Liushen, Xu Shengji, Qian Wenguang, and Qian Wenbiao, previously hired ten lawyers, led by Shang Min, to appeal to the Executive Yuan against the Ministry of Finance's decision to uphold the previous disposition of the Shanghai Fangbang Road property case by the former Shanghai Baojing Official Property Bureau. They requested a fair judgment. It is now known that the Executive Yuan has ruled to uphold the Ministry of Finance's previous ruling. The decision has been issued by the Executive Yuan to the Municipal Government and forwarded to the aforementioned representatives for compliance.</p>

<h3>Court Order Explains Protest Certificate for Negotiable Instruments</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association requested that the court clarify the procedure for making a protest certificate under Article 103 of the Negotiable Instruments Law, as the Negotiable Instruments Law and its implementation regulations did not mention it. The court forwarded this to the Department of Judicial Administration for interpretation and has now received an order from the Department. The order and official letter are recorded below: (1) The Jiangsu High Court Second Branch issued an order to comply with the matter. It received an instruction from the Department of Judicial Administration that the court had submitted a report requesting an interpretation of the procedure for a holder of a negotiable instrument to apply to the court for a protest certificate. The Department of Judicial Administration, after reviewing the report, submitted it to the Judicial Yuan for verification. The Judicial Yuan instructed that the holder's application to the court for a protest certificate should be considered a non-contentious matter, and fees should be collected in accordance with the Provisional Rules for Fee Collection for Non-Contentious Matters. The preparation of the certificate and all other matters may be handled by the court clerk. (2) The Shanghai Special District Local Court issued an official letter stating: "The association's letter requested a detailed explanation of the actual procedure for handling the application for a protest certificate and the simple methods that the holder and the court should use, so that it can be forwarded to the members for their reference. The court should be applied with a written statement, and the original of the rejected negotiable instrument should be attached to the statement. The stamp duty should be purchased and affixed in accordance with the Provisional Rules for Fee Collection for Non-Contentious Matters.

<h3>Robbery and Murder of a Bandit on Catholic Church Street Last Night</h3>
<p>▲ Bodyguard Opens Fire and Hits a Bandit</p>
<p>▲ Four Robbers, One Dead, Three Escaped</p>
<p>At 7:05 last night, four robbers suddenly appeared at the Chengfeng Woolen Goods Store, No. 9-10 Xiangyu Lane, Catholic Church Street, French Concession, plotting a robbery. Fortunately, the bodyguard of the store was vigilant and ambushed behind the banister. When the robbers went upstairs, he suddenly opened fire. As a result, one robber was shot twice and fled out the door, collapsing on the way. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲ Opening a Woolen and Knitting Goods Store for Eight Years Mr. Hu, a native of Ningbo, has been operating the Chengfeng Woolen and Knitting Goods Store at No. 9-10, Alley 1, Xiangyu Lane, Catholic Church Street, French Concession for eight years. The remaining rooms are rented to Longzhang Indigo Store, Chengzhi Pigment Store, Hengji Photographic Film Material Store, and Yijuxing Woolen and Sundries Store. The main door of No. 10 has been closed for years, and entry and exit are through the main door of No. 9.</p>
<p>▲ Hiring a Bodyguard for Defense To avoid being targeted by bandits, Mr. Hu hired a bodyguard a year ago for security, as there are many stores in the building and the location is quiet. The bodyguard, named Wu Jingui, is from Shandong, nearly 30 years old, exceptionally strong, and particularly vigilant. Hu valued him highly and specifically purchased a self-defense pistol to prevent emergencies.</p>
<p>▲ Four Robbers Arrive Suddenly, Two with Handguns At 7:05 last night, four robbers arrived, two wearing blue cloth robes, one wearing a gray serge gown, and one wearing a purple sauce-colored silk robe, covered with an old overcoat. They spoke with a northern accent. Two robbers were armed with handguns and rushed in through the main door. At that time, Hu's driver, A-Xi, was about to go out to urinate and encountered the robbers face to face. The robbers had already detected that Hu had hired a bodyguard. Upon seeing A-Xi, they mistook him for the bodyguard.</p>
<p>▲ Bodyguard Vigilantly Ambushes in the Dark Upon seeing A-Shan, the robbers immediately held the gun against A-Xi's chest, forbidding him from making a sound. One robber held a gun to watch him. The three robbers went straight into the parlor. However, the bodyguard Wu Jingui was standing idly in the parlor and saw several people rushing in, taking out a gun to scare A-Xi. Knowing that he had encountered a robbery, he quickly retreated behind the screen, took out his self-defense pistol, loaded the bullet, and hid in the darkness behind the stairs, waiting in ambush.</p>
<p>▲ One Robber Shouts, and the Bandits Flee One robber was responsible for watching the driver and also acted as a lookout. The remaining robbers entered the hall, looking around, appearing very flustered, and repeatedly shouting, "Where is the money? Get it out quickly!" After shouting, they walked towards the screen, intending to go straight upstairs. However, just as he reached the middle section of the stairs, two gunshots suddenly rang out. At the same time, a robber wearing an overcoat cried out, "Ah yo, ah yo" repeatedly. Seeing that the situation was not good, the robbers quickly turned around and fled out the door.</p>
<p>▲ The Wounded Bandit Falls and Dies It turned out that the two gunshots were fired by the bodyguard. One robber had been shot twice and, wounded, fled out of the alley, went south to Avenue Edward VII, turned west, and then went north into Zhubao San Road. However, the wounded robber had just fled to the entrance of No. 29 when he fell to the ground and died due to injuries to vital parts. The remaining robbers took the opportunity to escape without a trace. The patrolman from post No. 289 saw him, sent him to Renji Hospital nearby by car. After the doctor's examination, it was found that he had already died. He immediately notified the police station, which sent detectives to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall to examine the body.</p>
<p>▲ The Dead Bandit Had Two Bullets in His Body The examination revealed that the dead bandit had two bullets in his body. One hit his abdomen, going in from the front and out from the back, and the other pierced his right chest and right shoulder. The bandit had a slightly pockmarked face, was about 30 years old, wore an old overcoat, a dark sauce-colored silk robe, silk pants, his hair was combed back, black silk socks, velvet shoes, and wore a black copper basin hat. The body is waiting for an autopsy this afternoon.</p>
<h3>Organization of the Gongfa Company</h3>
<p>▲ Two Accountants Cleared Yesterday</p>
<p>▲ Stating That There Is No Partnership or Agreement</p>
<p>▲ Accountants Reported to the Social Bureau Yesterday</p>
<p>Accountants Wu Zheng and Pan Zhaobang previously inquired about the partnership agreement and shareholder list of Gongfa Company. They received a letter from the company yesterday, but it was not formally stamped. They immediately replied, "Replying directly, we have received your company's reply of February 11th, stating that you inquired about the Gongfa Company's partnership agreement and shareholder list. The situation is difficult for outsiders to understand, because Gongfa Company is not a partnership and has no agreement. Now, we will give a simple answer in good faith, hoping for your understanding. Ten years ago, Mr. Huang Chujiu initiated the night market exchange at the Great World, starting with rapid success and great prosperity. Later, due to the exchange turmoil, he was caught in a vortex, leading to failure. Mr. Huang felt quite uneasy about the suffering shareholders, so he merged the established Great World Day and Night Bank, Chinese and Western Pharmacy, Fuchang Tobacco Company, and Hot Spring Bathhouse into one, reorganizing it into Gongfa Company. He converted the shares of the night market exchange, etc., at a discounted price of 50% for each share of ten yuan, into a total of 700,000 yuan (Huang accounted for about 60%) as shares of Gongfa Company. He solemnly declared to the shareholders that he would do his best to ensure that all shareholders recovered their losses. Since then, Mr. Huang has been fully responsible in the capacity of chairman and general manager. Although interest has never been interrupted, dividends have never been distributed. Shareholders' meetings and board meetings have not been held for several years, making it difficult to comply with the company's regulations. In short, we trusted them too much, leading to today's results, which is very painful. The above is all the truth. We hope for your understanding. The incoming letter is responsible for replying in the name of Gongfa Company, but it is not stamped (with the Gongfa Company seal, it is difficult to use as a formal letter. Accordingly, we reply to your company and request that you quickly stamp it formally. Accountants Wu and Pan submitted to the Social Bureau yesterday, saying, "Submitting directly, we previously received Decree No. 6323 from your bureau, instructing our accountants to submit the articles of association and the list of shareholders and directors of Gongfa Company to the bureau as soon as possible, and to report the liquidation situation at any time. We have already submitted a report on receiving and keeping the Shanghai Day and Night Bank and the Shanghai Great World Savings Department (i.e., the Savings Department) and the balance sheet for inspection on February 2nd. Now, we will copy the abridged plan for the liquidation of the bank and department and the handling situation ordered by the French Concession Mixed Court to your bureau for your inspection and filing. Furthermore, our accountants were appointed as liquidators of the bank and department by the French Concession Mixed Court on February 9th. In addition to the published announcement, we jointly present this to the Director of the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau.</p>
<h3>The High Court Still Needs to Inquire in Detail About the Dalun Real Estate Lawsuit</h3>
<p>▲ The Municipal General Chamber of Commerce Replied to the High Court</p>
<p>▲ Various Key Points Are Still Not Clear</p>
<p>The Great China Department Store previously leased a piece of land near Zhifu Lane on Nanjing Road from Dalun Real Estate Company to demolish and build a seven-story department store. Because the existing tenants refused to move, they were in litigation with Dalun Real Estate Company, preventing the Great China from starting construction. Although the Great China purchased the land from Dalun, the tenants refused to move because the transfer of ownership should be restricted while the lawsuit was in progress. Since Dalun disagreed with the second-instance judgment and appealed to the Supreme Court, the court reviewed the files and believed that there were doubts about the second-instance judgment. The court sent it back to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court for retrial last month. The High Court followed the instructions of the Supreme Court and sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal General Chamber of Commerce to investigate. It is recently reported that the Municipal General Chamber of Commerce has now replied to the High Court truthfully. Regarding the point of whether there is any custom for not signing a lease contract during the investigation, it said that there is no precedent to cite. As for the economic flow and commercial prosperity after the opening of the Great China Department Store, it must depend on the situation of the company's operation in the future, and it is impossible to predict it now. Although the High Court has received a reply, it is still unclear. It plans to subpoena both parties to court in the near future for detailed questioning.</p>
<h3>Female Student Demands Divorce</h3>
<p>▲ Both Lawsuits Were Rejected</p>
<p>▲ Plans to Appeal to the Supreme Court Again</p>
<p>▲ Accusing Wife of Non-Virginity on Wedding Night</p>
<p>▲ Maid Recounts the Young Madam's Suffering</p>
<p>Ms. Zhai Xiuying, a student at the Patriotic Girls' School, is 29 years old and quite beautiful. She married Shen Rongzong last year. Shen is 27 years old and studied at Fudan University. The couple suddenly divorced after only a few months of marriage. Xiuying claimed that she could not bear Shen's abuse, so she filed a petition with the Special District Local Court a few days ago, requesting a divorce. The court rejected it. Zhai was still unwilling to give up and entrusted lawyers Lu Qi and Wu Shou Gong to appeal to the Second Branch of the Higher Court. On the afternoon of the 4th of this month, the first hearing was held. The hearing was conducted by Judge Hu Yigu of the Second Civil Court. Because both parties were in academia, many male and female students attended the court that day, and most of them were classmates of both parties. Yesterday was the date of the verdict. The previous trial situation and the verdict are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Previous Trial Situation After Judge Hu took the seat, the plaintiff Zhai Xiuying shyly stated the reasons for the divorce, saying that there were two points: (1) She could not bear her husband's abuse. Before the marriage, both parties did not want to get married. It was all based on the orders of her parents and the words of the matchmaker. On the wedding date, Shen avoided marriage in Hangzhou. Within a few months of marriage, she was beaten three times. From this point of view, what is the normal affection between husband and wife? (2) She suffered serious insult from her husband. On the wedding night, he accused me of not being a virgin. One day, I accompanied my sister to the New World at my mother's request, and he accused me of going to a brothel, slandering me completely. Under such circumstances, it is really difficult to grow old together. She should be allowed to divorce. After stating this, Judge Hu ordered the witness, the maid A-Xiu, to the witness stand, asking how the relationship between the Xiuying couple was usually. A-Xiu replied that the young madam and the young master had a bad relationship. When she returned home after a full month, the young master searched the young madam's handbag repeatedly. The young master really didn't treat the young madam like family members, guarding against her like a thief. Moreover, the young master did not sleep in the same bed with the young madam at night. After the young madam went to the New World, she was slapped twice, punched once, and kicked once when she returned, and the next day, blood was found in the spittoon. At this point, Judge Hu questioned Shen Rongzong again. Shen confessed that he had studied at Fudan University. The marriage was decided by both parents and obtained my consent. Before marriage, the two parties communicated and were deeply in love. After marriage, they were also deeply affectionate. This divorce lawsuit is not Xiuying's intention, but her father's claim. Judge Hu immediately ordered the lawyers of both parties to begin the debate. After the lawyers of both parties debated each other, Judge Hu announced the end of the debate and scheduled the verdict for the afternoon of the 11th of this month.</p>
<p>▲ Yesterday's Due Date for Verdict Yesterday, Judge Hu still opened the civil court to pronounce the verdict. Zhai Xiuying did not arrive, and Shen Rongzong arrived on time to await the verdict. The appeal was immediately dismissed. It is heard that Zhai Xiuying is still unwilling to accept it and plans to appeal to the Supreme Court again.</p>
<h3>Husband and Wife Eat Puffer Fish and Die Together</h3>
<p>▲ One Fish Kills Two Lives</p>
<p>Jin Liangshi, a woman from Jiangbei, was 45 years old and used to collect wild vegetables everywhere. She bought a puffer fish at the market the day before yesterday, brought it home for cooking, and ate it with her husband Kui Guangsheng. At first, they felt the taste was exceptionally delicious, but three hours later, their abdomens gradually became painful due to the swelling of the fish roe. They cried for help. Neighbors hired a car to send them to Tongren Hospital for treatment. The hospital did not keep female patients, so Jin Liangshi was changed to Guangren Hospital, but both were beyond salvation. They both died at 8:00 PM. The police received the report and sent detectives to the Fielun Road to examine the bodies. Prosecutor Guo from the Special District Local Court was commissioned to the office for examination, ascended to the public seat, and questioned the deceased's nephew Jin Wenxi and his friend Qin Cunyu, who surrendered to claim the body. After approval, Jin and others made a statement and took it away for burial.</p>
<h3>Frank Buck Left Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ The Grand Meeting at the Cathay Hotel Yesterday</p>
<p>▲ Du Xigui Specially Gave Several Embroidered Items</p>
<p>American movie star Frank Buck arrived in Shanghai the night before last. Yesterday morning, he and the World Tour Group took cars to tour the streets.</p>
<p>At 4:00 PM yesterday, Mr. and Mrs. Mo Aijun, representatives of the National News Agency in New York, held a grand tea party at the Cathay Hotel to welcome Mr. Buck. About 100 people participated, mostly foreigners. On the Chinese side, those who attended included Admiral Du Xigui, Zhao Jinqing, Director of the Industrial and Commercial Delegation, Wu Jingxiong, former President of the Provisional Court, Diao Minqian, Director of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Liu Yunfang, Deputy Director of the Foreign Affairs Office, and Liu Zhanen, President of Shanghai University. First, Mo Aijun delivered a welcome speech, saying that Mr. Buck's art on the screen is known worldwide, and this visit to China has the mission of international emotional connection, so he is happy to introduce him to the Shanghai community. Then, Mr. Buck stood up, smiled and replied, being very humble and extremely humorous. The guests applauded. Finally, Mo recited the telegram from Wang Zhengting, Minister of Foreign Affairs, saying that he was detained in Beijing for official business and could not attend the grand meeting, which was regrettable. He sent Mr. Diao Minqian as a representative to attend and wished Mr. Buck good health. The meeting ended at about 5:00 PM. Mr. Buck and his entourage took a small boat to Wusong at 7:00 PM last night and transferred to the original boat to Hong Kong, passing through Singapore to hunt in Siam. Mr. Du Xigui specially gave Mr. Buck several embroidered items as a souvenir because he was unable to entertain him due to time constraints yesterday.</p>
<h3>The Accuser in the Xin Xin Employee Embezzlement Case Sentenced to Six Months in Prison</h3>
<p>▲ Zhou Shuqing Commits the Crime of Joint Embezzlement</p>
<p>▲ Given Probation for Two Years Due to Surrender</p>
<p>Zhang Shiying, Weng Hengqi, Yang Fuyuan, and others, retired employees of Xin Xin Company, colluded and embezzled more than 180,000 in account funds when they were employed years ago. They were exposed recently, and Inspector Wang Changgeng detained them and sent them to the Special District Local Court for separate punishment, which has been reported in this newspaper. It is found that a total of 13 people participated in the embezzlement. Zhou Shuqing, who reported this time, was also a member of the embezzlement group and is still working at the company. The director of the company, thinking that he had surrendered, did not pursue the matter generously, so he was not sued jointly with Zhang Shiying and others. However, the Legal Group of the Bureau of Public Works believes that the law cannot be selectively applied. Since Zhou jointly embezzled, he should be held criminally responsible. Although he surrendered, the law has provisions for cases of surrender. It seems insufficient to warn those who commit fraud if they want to completely avoid criminal liability by surrendering. Therefore, he still sued Zhou for joint embezzlement in the Special Court. Zhou admitted that it was undeniable that he jointly embezzled. Judge Zhou sentenced him to six months in prison for the crime, and announced a two-year probation in court, considering that he surrendered.</p>
<h3>Verdict on the Russian's Opening of a Casino</h3>
<p>▲ Defendants Sentenced to Two Months Imprisonment and Fined</p>
<p>▲ Plaintiff Countersued for False Accusation, Sentenced to One Month Imprisonment</p>
<p>Gao Laisi Re Gao Fu, the president of the Russian Military Society at No. 9 Tongfu Road, accused Ai Hai Ying Peng Fan Che Lin in the Special District Court of three crimes: seizing the society, opening a casino, and intimidating with a gun. The case had been heard several times, and the details have been reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday was the date for the verdict. At 2 PM, Judge Cheng Shangfeng opened the Fifth Court to pronounce the judgment. The plaintiff, defendants, and their respective lawyers were all present on time to await the verdict. After Judge Cheng took the bench, the lawyers from both sides first engaged in a round of debate. Judge Cheng then asked the plaintiff and defendants a few questions before declaring the debate in this case closed and awaiting the verdict. The main text of the judgment is as follows: Ai Hai Ying Peng Fan Che Lin are each sentenced to two months imprisonment and a concurrent fine of 400 yuan in silver for the crime of jointly providing a place for gambling with the intention of making a profit. The other charges are acquitted. Gao Laisi Re Gao Fu is sentenced to one month of imprisonment for the crime of false accusation, which is reduced in penalty. The number of days of detention before the judgment becomes final can be offset against the imprisonment at a rate of two days for one day. If the fine cannot be paid, it can be commuted to imprisonment at a rate of three yuan per day. During the appeal period, the defendants are allowed to be released on bail of 2,000 yuan, and the defendant Gao Laisi Re Gao Fu in the countersuit is allowed to be released on bail of 400 yuan.</p>
<h3>Pirates Outside Wusong Estuary Request Amnesty</h3>
<p>After the various pirate gangs outside the Wusong Estuary engaged in infighting, they attacked each other on the sea, resulting in mutual slaughter. As a result, Shen Guanxi's gang has fled north, and the two smaller gangs of Song Lisan and Zhong Zhaokui have also invaded and plundered various towns along the river. Only Yan Zhenling's gang, with more than 400 pirates and more than 20 sailing ships, is still extorting donations from fishermen at sea. Recently, Yan's pirates have felt that living at sea is not a long-term solution and are quite willing to abandon evil and return to righteousness. A few days ago, they requested the district office in Lüsi to forward their request to the military and political authorities for approval of amnesty. If this is successful, navigation to and from Wusong Estuary may be peaceful.</p>
<h3>Xia Jingeng and Wife's Divorce Case</h3>
<p>▲ Both Parties to Go Out and Reconcile Again</p>
<p>Xia Yao, the wife of Xia Jingeng, filed a criminal lawsuit in the Special District Court, through lawyer Shi Lin, against her husband for the crimes of assault and abandonment, seeking a divorce. Judge Cheng Shangfeng had previously heard the case once and ordered the parties to reconcile outside of court and rescheduled the hearing, as reported in previous newspapers. Because the reconciliation between the two parties failed, Judge Cheng opened the Fifth Court again yesterday afternoon at 2 PM to hear the case. After briefly questioning both parties, he declared that since they are husband and wife and have lived together for eight years and have children, reconciliation without divorce is the best solution. According to the court's opinion, Xia Yao should return home with her husband immediately, and Xia Jingeng should issue a statement promising to give Xia Yao 20 yuan in silver each month for living expenses, so that they would not need to litigate again to avoid suffering. When asked if Xia Jingeng agreed, Xia answered in the affirmative. When asked if Xia Yao agreed, Xia Yao replied that 20 yuan per month was not enough and that she had no guarantee. Judge Cheng said that you should return home with your husband, and Xia Jingeng will issue a statement promising to give you 20 yuan per month. If he does not give you the money, you can still sue him. If you want more, I don't think Xia has the ability to provide it. He further instructed that, whether you agree or not, the court must handle the case in this way. Xia Yao then replied, "In that case, he has a mistress. Can the court rule for a divorce?" Judge Cheng said that this was another issue, but at the same time, he instructed Xia Jingeng, "You should not abandon your wife and have an affair with someone else." Xia replied that he did not have a mistress. At this point, Shi Lin, the plaintiff's lawyer, stood up and requested the court to reschedule the hearing to allow for another reconciliation. Judge Cheng agreed, saying that whether you agree or not, reconciliation is best; otherwise, the verdict will be pronounced next time.</p>

<h3>News from the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Relief Association Regarding Shaanxi</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Relief Association received a message from Shaanxi yesterday, stating that the province has suffered from successive years of disasters, and the people are in dire straits and in urgent need of relief. Now that it is the severe winter season, with ice and snow on the ground, and the time when the old harvest is gone and the new harvest has not yet come, the disaster victims are freezing and starving, on the verge of death. Winter relief is now extremely urgent. The provincial relief association is actively preparing according to plan, such as distributing cotton clothes, setting up shelters, and opening porridge kitchens, of which there are more than 20. It is striving to provide relief. Recently, the porridge kitchens have reported that the disaster situation in various places is still very severe, and the disaster victims are waiting for relief like expecting clouds and rain, but the amount of food is too small and the number of tickets is limited, making it difficult not only to help the masses but also to maintain the current situation. They are presenting petitions to the provincial relief association, requesting that porridge be allocated to maintain the porridge kitchens, as the situation is as precarious as a pile of eggs. To save the survivors of this disaster and give them a chance to live, if food and money are not available, then there may be no survivors left.</p>
<h3>Passenger Dies Before Boarding Ship</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at around 6 PM, a man, about 30 years old and appearing to be a worker, carrying a suitcase and an umbrella, bought a ticket at the Ningshao Pier on the 16th Pier, intending to board the Ningshao steamer to Ningbo. At that time, the ticket seller noticed that the man's face was pale and his breath was weak, as if he was seriously ill. Fearing that something might happen after he boarded the ship, he ordered the No. 1 patrolman of the Ningshao Company to escort him to the Red Cross Hospital in Nanshi for treatment. Unexpectedly, the man died shortly after arriving at the hospital, before he could be treated. The company then reported the matter to the First District Police Department for investigation.

<h3>News of the Italian Lending Bank</h3>

The bank's dividends have been 8% in previous years, but it is rare to achieve this result in the current depressed economy. This is because the bank's operations are proceeding step by step, and the plan approved at last year's meeting has been fully implemented, which is why the board of directors is very satisfied.</p>

<p>Women's Normal College to Merge with Normal University</p>
<p>Russian College of Law and Politics No Longer Enrolling New Students</p>
<p>All Colleges and Institutes to Set Up Preparatory Courses and High Schools to Run an Affiliated High School</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education has ordered the reorganization of Peking University, the Russian College of Law and Politics, and Peking Normal University. The orders are listed below:</p>
<h3>(1) Order to Peking University Wen</h3>
<p>"It is found that the existing organization of Peking University is mostly the result of factual succession. The system is complex and difficult to manage thoroughly. Teaching equipment and management in all aspects are gradually declining. It is difficult to improve the efficiency of education without making changes and reorganizing. The following measures are hereby stipulated regarding the organizational aspects of the university that should be improved:</p>
<p>(1) The Women's Normal College and its affiliated schools will no longer be subordinate to Peking University starting this semester and will merge with the original National Peking Normal University to form the National Peking Normal University, temporarily divided into the First Department and the Second Department. (2) The central government has formulated other measures to cultivate Russian specialists. The Russian College of Law and Politics, originally subordinate to Peking University, should be gradually closed down starting this year and will no longer enroll new students. A closing committee should be established, organized by three members selected and hired by the president of Peking University, to handle the closing and preside over the college affairs. During the closing period, it will still be temporarily called the Russian College of Law and Politics and will be subordinate to Peking University, but no new president will be appointed. (3) The existing departments and classes of the Law School will remain as they are for the time being. How to change the subjects or run other colleges starting next school year should be carefully investigated by Peking University and a plan should be submitted to the Ministry for approval. (4) The College of Art should be closed down in accordance with the previous order of the Ministry. Peking University is responsible for supervising and reorganizing the college affairs and saving costs. (5) The Women's College should be renamed the Women's College of Arts and Sciences starting this semester to match its name and reality, and efforts should be made to enrich its content. If it is necessary to increase funding, Peking University should make overall arrangements and supplement it from the college's funding scope and submit it to the Ministry for approval. (6) The organization of the President's Office of Peking University should be appropriately expanded in order to effectively reorganize school affairs. The president of Peking University should formulate an organizational outline and submit it for approval. The expenses increased due to the expansion should not exceed 2,000 yuan per month and should be planned and subsidized by Peking University from the funds of each college and submitted to the Ministry for approval. (7) The preparatory courses and high school classes set up in the colleges and institutes of Peking University should be planned in detail by Peking University to jointly run a perfect affiliated high school. Peking University should implement the above measures to seek improvement and report the implementation to the Ministry for record."</p>
<h3>(2) Another Order to Peking University Wen</h3>
<p>"Yesterday, the Ministry of Education ordered Peking University to resolve the turmoil in the Russian College of Law and Politics, approving the resignation of President Duan Qitang and dismissing the teachers and staff involved in the turmoil, stating: 'It has been found that the student unrest in the Russian College of Law and Politics of the university has been prolonged, and the dispute has become increasingly serious. The Ministry has ordered Xie Shuying, Section Chief, to go to investigate and report on the abandonment of college affairs and the students' blocking of accounting and other excessive actions, which is very distressing. It is reported that the president of the college, Duan Qitang, has applied for resignation and should be approved immediately. All accounts of the college should be checked and submitted by the president to the university for detailed review and reported to the Ministry for record. The teachers and staff of the college who were involved in the turmoil and have been dismissed should not be rehired. In addition to the fact that the college should be closed down year by year, the Ministry has separately ordered the university to comply and take responsibility for supervising and reorganizing."</p>
<h3>(III) Order to Beiping Normal University</h3>
<p>It has been decided by the Ministry that the Women's Normal College and its affiliated schools, originally under the jurisdiction of Beiping University, will no longer be under the jurisdiction of Beiping University from this semester. They will be combined with the university to form the National Beiping Normal University, to create a perfect institution in the country for training secondary school teachers and educational administrators, and for researching educational academia. At a time when the nation is rectifying education, the school bears a very heavy mission. The following are the matters that need to be improved urgently in the university:</p>
<p>(1) The National Beiping Normal University after the merger will be temporarily divided into two parts, the first and the second. The departments and classes of the original National Beiping Normal University will be the first part, and the original Women's Normal College will be the second part. The principal of National Beiping Normal University shall draft detailed measures on how to avoid duplication of the departments set up in the two parts, and how to unify the organization and establish colleges in accordance with the University Organization Law to gradually abolish the separation of the two parts, and submit them to the Ministry for approval before the summer vacation of this year. (2) After the merger, the funds of the Women's Normal College and its affiliated schools will still be distributed according to the original allocation, and the Normal University will receive them all at once. The expenditure of the funds will remain the same as before this year, but efforts must be made to be thrifty. The principal of National Beiping Normal University shall draft detailed measures on how to plan and redistribute the funds as a whole in the next year, and submit them to the Ministry for approval. (3) The Normal University should focus on cultivating secondary school teachers and educational administrators, and on researching educational academia. After the merger, the university's curriculum, equipment, training, etc., should be based on this purpose, and should be stipulated separately. The affiliated primary and secondary schools and kindergartens must be fully utilized to give normal students more opportunities for practical training. (4) All the affiliated primary and secondary schools and Montessori kindergartens of the original Beiping Normal University and Women's Normal College will be temporarily operated as before, but they should be gradually planned to become an integrated affiliated school of the Normal University in the future, and there should be a close connection between the university and the affiliated school, so that the main functions of both parties can be gradually completed. The above items should be earnestly implemented by the university to seek improvement. This order is hereby issued for compliance, and the handling situation should be reported for reference. This order.</p>

<h3>Dr. Hua Xuming Arrives in Shanghai Tomorrow</h3>
<p>▲ The Characteristics of the Winnetka System</p>
<p>The American educator Dr. Carleton W. Washburne will come to China on the 13th of this month to give lectures. Few people in the country know much about the doctor's life. According to him, the doctor is a researcher of individual education, the creator of the so-called "Winnetka System." He graduated from Stanford University and has been engaged in elementary school education for many years. He deeply suspected the school class system and was determined to study individual teaching. He initially started to try it out, but was repeatedly opposed by the educational authorities. In 1919, Dr. Hua Xuming was hired by a small school in Winnetka Town near Chicago to conduct a large-scale individual education experiment. The characteristics of the experiment are briefly described below:</p>
<p>1. The Winnetka system contains four important principles: (1) to enable children to obtain as much knowledge and skills as possible that can be applied to their future lives; (2) to enable each child to naturally, happily, and perfectly enjoy their childhood life; (3) the progress of mankind lies in the full development of each member; (4) the welfare of the people must be in the development of the entire social translation of each member.</p>
<p>2. The curriculum of the Winnetka system includes two parts: (1) a part of the course includes knowledge and skills that are sufficient to cultivate children's socialized attitudes; (2) a part of the course includes stimuli and environment that are sufficient to cultivate children's efforts in creative work.</p>
<p>3. The individual teaching implemented by the Winnetka system includes three special processes: (1) the goal of the curriculum is determined according to the needs of society and is organized with reference to the children's ability to develop in each period; (2) the compilation of teaching materials can enable children to learn by themselves and correct their own mistakes; (3) the image of Sir Hua Xuming, the creator of the Winnetka system</p>
<p>The compilation of diagnostic tests can be adapted to the application of each stage of learning. 4. The Winnetka system completely breaks the class teaching. In the Winnetka school, there is no distinction between grades. A certain child must sit in a certain classroom, and all are distinguished by social age. The so-called "social age" refers to the fact that he can be most united with other children in the classroom.</p>
<p>5. The Winnetka system pays special attention to group and creation activities. The activity center is mostly concentrated in social science or literature. The purpose is to stimulate children to discover their personality, inspire their instincts and creativity, cultivate their sense of service, and their awareness of the welfare of the masses, in order to save the malformed development of individual education.</p>
<p>6. In the classrooms of Winnetka schools, there is no recitation or explanation. Diagnostic tests are used instead of recitation. On the other hand, there are more group and creative activities. Because there are children's self-study materials, there is very little need for teachers to explain.</p>
<p>Regarding the details of Winnetka, it is heard that the Children's Education Society, a domestic organization specializing in the study of children's education, will publish a special issue of Winnetka in the journal "Children's Education," which will be published by Kaiming Bookstore soon.</p>
<h3>Publication of the National Language Grammar</h3>

<h3>Monthly Meeting of the Chinese Sports Referees Association</h3>
<p>▲ New Referees Approved</p>
<p>▲ Referees Must Have Protection</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Sports Referees Association held a monthly meeting at Jinling Restaurant at 7:00 PM the night before last (the 11th). More than 20 people, including Xu Zhendong, Zhang Guoxun, Le Xiurong, Ling Xirun, and Zhou Jiaqi, attended and discussed the following cases:</p>
<p>(1) The Football Committee Member Le Xiurong and the Basketball Committee Member Xu Zhendong reported on the examination of the referees who took the exam and the names of those who passed. The general meeting approved the acceptance of the new referees as formal members. There were three football referees: Wu Shouheng, Zhang Yi, and Hu Zong_. There were eight basketball referees: Le Xiurong, Wang Yiqiao, Huang Juying, Zhou Jiaqi, Wu Jiatang, Shi Zhaokang, and Zhang Peter Xiao Pei (2). Feng Jiasheng and Xu Shaowu were allowed to be members of the association. The basketball committee will test the two men's refereeing methods by mail.</p>
<p>( ) The book "A List of Shanghai Chinese Sports Referees Association" has been published and will be distributed to members in and out of the city for reference. If outside groups or individuals want to obtain it, they can ask the secretariat for it.</p>
<p>(4) In view of the contempt for the referees' decisions at the previous National Games, if members of the association are hired to serve as officials at the next National Games, they must negotiate protection clauses with the association in advance. The referees' decisions should be absolutely obeyed, and there is no room for change or compromise, in order to comply with the principles of sports competitions.</p>
<p>(5) Zhang Xinfu and Wu Bang_, two members of the association who are currently representatives of the National Games, reported that the next National Games will be held on the Double Tenth Festival. They are fully prepared for the meeting, and the sports referees for the meeting will still rely on the hard work of the members. The problems of accommodation and reception will be prepared by us to the best of our ability, and we do not expect any disappointment.</p>

<h3>Xiqing Basketball Tournament Ends, McLins Wins Loser's Championship</h3>
<p>▲ Defeated East China 29 to 27 Last Night</p>
<p>McLins won every game in the Xiqing Loser's Championship, and eventually won the championship with a full victory. Among the five games, the two games against Qingguang and East China were the closest. The game against East China last night was particularly tense. The overall situation was that McLins was mostly at a disadvantage. However, they rose up in the last ten minutes and finally achieved great success and happily won the championship.</p>
<p>▲ Final Results of Each Team</p>
<p>Team Name Wins Losses Points For Points Against Win Percentage</p>
<p>McLins 5 0 185 147 1.000</p>
<p>Qingguang 4 1 208 141 0.800</p>
<p>East China 3 2 164 153 0.600</p>
<p>Pirates 2 3 160 139 0.400</p>
<p>Laoda 1 4 124 159 0.200</p>
<p>Yeshi 0 5 124 226 0.100</p>
<h3>▲ McLins Achieves Great Success</h3>
<p>丨East China's Efforts Fall Short丨</p>
<p>Referee Bai Bobo announced the start of the game. East China sent heavy troops. Lu Zhongen exited from the oblique path, Chen Long soared across the sea, and the sound of two goals was very strong. Gu Zhi scored one of McLins' two penalties, immediately tying the score. East China's five tigers fought in a wheel battle, with Chen, Li, Wang, Lu, and Ouyang showing their skills and each scoring one goal, reaching a super peak of 14 to 4. Suddenly, the overall situation tended to be flat. After a long time, McLins gained the upper hand and quickly took down the enemy's fortress. Due to the opponent's tight defense, the gains were limited. East China took the lead with 16 to 12 in the first half. In the sound of the second battle, Huo Shipi suddenly received a pass from Lu and took the opportunity to invade, taking it down in one fell swoop. Lu used a clever plan and took the lead again. Later, Bishuenong and Shatai made contributions one after another, tying the score at 18. Soon, it became 21 and 23. Afterwards, McLins pressed forward and East China followed, and it became 27. In the end, McLins Brown scored a goal and finally took the lead with 29 to 27. It can be said to be extremely lucky.</p>
<p>▲ Qingguang Pirates Benefit</p>
<p>Qingguang's victory over Laoda was actually obtained from a hard battle. At the beginning of the game, the two teams were difficult to distinguish between first and second, and each scored 16 points in the first half. In the second half, Qingguang changed its lineup, and the situation was better. After 19, 21, and 23, Qingguang suddenly rose, and Laoda tried hard to counterattack but failed, and finally lost. As a result, Qingguang won 42 to 28.</p>
<p>The Pirates performed very well. Their offense and defense were impeccable. Yeshi was at a disadvantage and suffered greatly. In the first half, the Pirates scored 29 and Yeshi scored 14. In the second half, the Pirates were as comfortable as they wanted, and their score increased greatly. Yeshi waited to die and was helpless. When the Pirates scored 45 points, Kang Yuefa scored a goal, otherwise the second half would have ended with a duck egg. As a result of the game, the Pirates won 48 to 16. The referees were both Bailey Xin.</p>

<p>Owner 丨 Nonsense. I didn't see you come here.</p>

<h3>Zhang Huizan's Decisiveness Yang Hua</h3>
<p>The Red Army spread to the border. There was no one left. Like Xiang, like E, like Gan. These were the most extreme cases. Zhang Huizan, the commander of the 18th Division of the National Army, died in the Donggu battle. Zhang was a famous general from Hunan. He participated in all the party-state battles in the province. Zhang was involved in all of them. In the National Protection War, Zhang was the commander of the guerrillas in central Hunan. In the aid-E war, Zhang was the brigade commander and commander of the Yangtze River defense. In the bandit suppression war, Zhang was the division commander. During the Northern Expedition of the Founding Army and the Northern Expedition of the Revolutionary Army, Zhang led the division as a partial commander and drove on the battlefield, all of which were defeated. Zhang was especially known for his calculations in the Western Expedition. At that time, Zhang was the deputy army commander of the Second Army. His troops were stationed in Yichang. The army commander was Lu Diping, who was stationed in Nanjing. At that time, the central government was using troops against Tang Shengzhi, which was the so-called "Western Expedition." The Second Army was a central government unit. Tang ordered Wu Shang, Li Pinxian, and He Jian to use the forces of three armies to conspire against the Second Army in order to avoid future troubles. Zhang knew of the plot, so he summoned his generals to a meeting. Everyone thought that the isolated army had no support, so it was better to withdraw from Yichang to western Hunan to wait for the military victory of the central army before planning to respond. Zhang forcefully rejected the crowd's opinions and insisted on going straight to Wuhan, hoping to quickly resolve Tang's troops. He sent messengers to persuade Yang Sen to the west, luring him with Yichang's tax revenue, and persuaded Fang Zhenwu to the north (Fang was stationed in Xiangyang at the time) to work hard for the party-state. Sure enough, the partial army went out in the morning, and Tang's troops were resolved at night.</p>
<p>In Hunan, everyone, whether women or children, knew his name. After being defeated in the aid-E war, Zhang was dismissed from his military post and transferred to the post of police chief of the provincial capital of Hunan. At that time, there was a woman in Changsha named Liu Mazi who specialized in luring women from good families to secretly engage in prostitution. The people of Hunan called it Taiji Ye, or Diaotai. The person in charge was called the Tidiao. Liu Mazi was the only big Tidiao in Changsha. At that time, Zhao Hengti ruled Hunan and made banquets and tours the fashion. Civil officials such as the director of the hall and the secretary, and military officers such as the division commander and the brigade commander, all regarded it as an honor to enter Liu Mazi's door once. Therefore, Liu Mazi's power was overwhelming for a time, and many women from good families were bewitched by her. Even the concubines and young ladies of the dignitaries and celebrities had many who recognized Liu Mazi as their godmother and obeyed Liu Mazi's orders. When Zhang took office, he wanted to arrest Liu Mazi and put her to death. However, because there were so many people she knew, the arrest warrant had not yet been returned, and the guarantee had already arrived. So he first ordered the clerk to record the charges, and personally led the soldiers to Liu Mazi's residence to arrest Liu and take her directly to the execution ground for execution. If he had engaged in interrogation, the guarantors would have come one after another. From then on, Zhang Huizan's name shook the entire Hunan. The people of Changsha still cite it as a topic of conversation today.</p>
<h3>Recording the Zhu Chengzhang Memorial Service Sun Choucheng</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhu Chengzhang was enthusiastic about public welfare. This time, he was tragically assassinated and died unjustly. Whether they knew him or not, everyone mourned. On the afternoon of the 8th, relatives, friends, and former colleagues held a memorial service for him to express their grief. Choucheng also went to participate. Here is a record of what I saw and felt.</p>
<p>The venue was on the second floor of the YMCA on Sichuan Road. The entrance was surrounded by pine and cypress trees. In the middle was embedded the eight characters "Mr. Zhu Chengzhang Memorial Service." Mr. Zhu was a convert to Christianity, so the ceremonies were different from ordinary ones. There were prayers, scripture readings, and blessings. I went at 2 o'clock and saw four orphans sitting side by side on the right side of the stage. They were all wearing gray cloth robes, white hats, and white shoes, with black gauze wrapped around their arms. On the stage was a half-length Western-style portrait of Mr. Zhu, looking lively and spirited. Above was a horizontal plaque with the inscription "His Spirit Will Last Forever, His Example Will Always Remain." On the side were couplets presented by Minister Song Ziwen and Wang Zhengting: "One Torch Burned the Jade of Bian He, a Tiny Star Fell in the Ninth Heaven," and "Only Grieve for the Unicorn Horn Being Broken, Do Not Compare It with a Feather." Because of the Christian connection, only pine, cypress, and fresh flowers were piled up like mountains. There was no sacrificial table. Twenty potted flowers were placed at the mouth of the stage, and seven wreaths. All the wreaths were embedded with cross shapes. Memorial banners and elegiac couplets were hung all over the four walls. Chairman Kong Xiangxi said when reporting the purpose of the meeting that people must die, but we must ask how the deceased lived before death. The career that Mr. Zhu made can be worthy of God, the country, and society. Then everyone sang a dirge. After the singing, the Westerner Fei Wusheng and Tang Chengxi took the stage to pray, using both Chinese and Western languages. Then Yu Rizhang read a section from the New Testament, Corinthians 1, chapter 15, section 37. When offering flowers, Kong Yongzhi, Yang Dunfu, Zhang Jiafu, Kuang Fuzhuo, and Lin Kanghou all held wreaths in their hands and went to the front of the portrait in a row to bow. On the speech order, it was stipulated that Mayor Zhang and other six people were limited to five minutes each. But as a result, Mayor Zhang spoke for six minutes on behalf of Yu Hongjun, Chen Guangfu spoke for nine minutes, Liu Wang Liming spoke for six minutes, Wang Rutang spoke for eleven minutes on behalf of Yu Rizhang, Bau Nai De (a Westerner) spoke for eight minutes, and Huang Renzhi spoke for twenty minutes. None of them exceeded the limit. Chen Guangfu had the deepest relationship with Mr. Zhu, so he was extremely sad when speaking. The elegiac couplet he presented was also the most poignant. The text said, "The old father is over eighty years old, the children are young, and the wife is weak. The pain is terrible. He abandoned the world after being attacked. He should know that he can close his eyes when he lets go." "We have been in the same boat for fifteen years. We trust each other sincerely. I am sad that the distant guest Yanshan has become an eternal farewell. I can't help but be too sad when I arrive at the funeral." Liu Wang Liming spoke highly of Zhu Jun's kindness to his wife and his care for his husband while concurrently leading his children, saying that this is rare at a time when the family system is being destroyed by borrowing the four words of freedom of love. Huang Renzhi greatly praised Zhu Jun's words of not retaliating against the enemy after the disaster. Then the Shanghai Ya Le Society sang a special dirge. Seven boys and seven girls sang together at the same time, in English. I don't know the meaning, but I just felt like complaining and weeping, which was very tragic. At the end, Pastor Shang Xiuzhong raised his hands and gave a blessing before the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Ye Yuhu's Letter to Yang Xiaolou</h3>
<p>Mr. Xiaolou, I heard that you have come to Shanghai. Because I have been sick for many days, I have not been able to listen to your elegant performance. I regret it very much. In Beiping, although we often met, we did not have a deep conversation. I know nothing about drama, but because I am interested in literature and art, I am also quite interested in this. I believe that our country's drama today should strive to preserve its truth and characteristics before we can talk about improvement. Otherwise, if the truth is lost first, how can we know its gains and losses? In recent years, in order to keep up with the times, various drama artists have mostly lost their old ways, and the older generation is gradually dying out, and there are few who can succeed them. This is especially the disaster of this way. Your Excellency's art transcends your peers, and there is no enemy today. In Shanghai, which follows the trend, there are still many people who truly appreciate Your Excellency, which is enough to know that fame comes after the fact. There is still a principle in this. However, what I urgently want to tell you is that Your Excellency should be aware that you are a special talent in the Chinese drama industry. For the sake of the Chinese drama industry, you should bear the responsibility of making your own unique art pass on to future generations. Now your age has passed fifty, and your physical strength has a tendency to gradually decline. I don't know if there is anyone among your senior disciples who is sufficient to succeed you. I believe that Your Excellency should pay special attention to selecting those who are of good quality and teachable, and do your best to mold them so that they can glimpse the mystery. In this way, the unique art will not be lost, and the great name will last forever with it. This is far better than leaving property to children and grandchildren. What I saw while sick, I presented frankly. I only hope that you will understand.</p>
<p>Ye Gongchuo, February 8th</p>
<h3>The Strange Creature of Xujiacun Village in Yixing, by Jiang Boquan</h3>
<p>Five or six li southwest of Heqiao Town in Yixing County, there is a village called Xujiacun Village. Half a li behind the village, there is a large pond, with a circumference of a hundred or so steps. The pond is connected to the outer river, but only by a small, narrow channel. Brambles are planted around the pond, providing resources for fuel. Villagers going to the market by boat must pass by it.</p>
<p>For the past half year, there has been a widespread rumor about a strange creature suddenly appearing in the pond. Villagers going to the market or returning from the market have been traveling together along the paths between the fields, avoiding it from afar. People speak of it with certainty, and within a few days, the rumor spread throughout the village. As a result, those who came to see the spectacle lined the road. Several of my relatives and friends also went to see it. However, no one could name what the creature was, despite the many viewers.</p>
<p>According to nearby residents, there is a large hole in the pond, more than a foot in diameter. There is also a hole of equal size next to the pond where it connects to the water. Initially, every night, a large lamp was seen from afar on the pond, emitting a red light. Upon closer inspection, the light became smaller. Approaching directly to observe it, the light became as small as a firefly, emerging from the opening of the hole. People gradually became suspicious and fearful. They continued to observe it silently for several days and nights. One morning, as the sun was about to rise from the eastern mountains, several villagers lingered by the pond to see what it was. Suddenly, a black dome appeared in the pond, almost level with the surface of the water. Gradually, the dome grew larger. The villagers were terrified and ran away. After a short while, they looked back, and the black dome had expanded to half the pond. When asked, those who had seen it confirmed that their observations were the same. It is said that this creature usually appears in the morning or after meals, especially on sunny days. If there is a lot of noise, it will not be seen.</p>
<p>The creature's mouth is slightly pointed. Some people therefore call it a "dragon-horse." However, no one knows what the creature's head, eyes, or body look like, because the viewers are timid and dare not get close to the pond. Moreover, if they agree to muster courage and go forward, the creature will sink and disappear. Therefore, no one has been able to name what the creature is to this day.</p>
<p>In my estimation, it must be an animal that has lived for many years. There is no such thing as a "monster" in this world. I hope a biologist will go and investigate to clear up the villagers' ignorance and bring it back to exhibit in a museum for people to study. (Unstamped)</p>
<h3>Tooth Stone, by Kang An</h3>
<p>Tooth stone is not a stone shaped like a tooth, but rather a stone with tooth marks. Its texture is fine and hard, and it is exceptionally beautiful. The locals call it "tooth stone."</p>
<p>Tooth stone is produced in Fuqiu Mountain in the western part of Yiyang, Hunan. Fuqiu Mountain is the second highest mountain in Yiyang. There is an ancient temple on top, inhabited by several monks. The mountain is full of large and small stones, all of which have tooth marks, some more, some less, some beautiful, some ugly. The tooth marks are crisscrossed, some shallow, some deep. The number of teeth varies, and the tooth marks are sometimes wide, sometimes narrow. The locals say they were gnawed by rats or other animals. It is difficult to determine whether there were animals in ancient times that bit stones. The monks say that immortals lived on this mountain in ancient times. They did not cook, but only ate stones to satisfy their hunger. Which of the two explanations is correct? Only geologists can provide an answer.</p>
<p>Since the Meilin Senior Elementary School was opened near the mountain, more and more people have been going to pick up tooth stones. Because of their beauty, they are carved into inkstones, inkwells, or other ornaments, which are very beautiful. Later, through the introduction of a certain gentleman, they were displayed at the Changsha Industrial Exhibition. Appreciators were willing to pay high prices to acquire them, and dozens of pieces were sold out within a week, bringing great profit to the carvers.</p>
<p>Although there are many tooth stones on the mountain now, few are beautiful. The monks in the temple may have collected a few pieces. It is unknown whether there are any still buried underground.</p>
<h3>Losses Due to Cold, by Chen Boying</h3>
<p>Last year's severe cold, with temperatures only reaching just over ten degrees Fahrenheit, was not only unprecedented in recent years, but also rare since the Guangxu era. As a result, someone lost ten thousand taels of silver. I record it to provide conversation material. There was a Cai Zihuang from Anting, who was once a provincial assemblyman. His family was comfortably well-off. He had a discerning eye and loved to collect. Last autumn, at the home of a certain Mo in the capital, he bought a set of Dong Qichang's calligraphic screens, a copy of the Diamond Sutra in ink, a painting of farming and weaving by a Ming artist, and a spittoon, for which he paid two hundred yuan, which was not enough. When he took them home and examined them carefully, he found that the calligraphy and painting were genuine and worth ten times the price, and the spittoon was actually a Song kiln piece. Song kiln pieces are worth no less than ten thousand taels of silver at current prices. If he waited to resell he could easily get fifty thousand taels. He was overjoyed and wanted to store them carefully. He wanted to display them in the hall, but he was afraid of attracting covetous eyes. He put them in a low place, but he was afraid that the children and servants would be careless and kick them. He put them in a high place, but he was afraid that cats and mice would knock them over. He hesitated for a long time and suddenly became worried about fire. After racking his brains all day, he finally came up with a solution. He bought two large vats and placed the spittoon in one of them, filling it with soil. He thought he had come up with a foolproof plan. At that time, antique dealers got wind of it and asked to buy it. Cai said, "This is a rare treasure and I cannot bear to part with it. But I can show it to you gentlemen to broaden your horizons." So the antique dealers went to his house and asked to see it. Cai opened the vat and took out the spittoon, but one corner was broken off. It turned out that the cold had frozen the water, causing the soil to freeze and break the pottery. Porcelain is valued above all else for its completeness. If it is broken or chipped, it is worthless. Cai then wept, holding the spittoon. Even seven days later, he was still sighing. The spittoon looked like the ones used today, black as lacquer, shining with a strange light. In the middle, at the bulging part, there were four flowering crabapple blossoms around it. The flowers were white as jade, pure and warm. The center of the flowers also depicted landscapes, colored red as a cockscomb and green as emeralds, vivid and lifelike. My friend Mr. Gu saw it with his own eyes. Some say its name was "Zhen."</p>
<h3>Epitaph for Yi Junshi (Continued), by Cheng Songwan of Ningxiang</h3>
<p>Thus eight years passed. In the year of Gengshen, on the thirtieth day of the eighth month, at the hour of Hai (9-11 PM), he fell ill and died in his residence in the capital. He was born on the fifth day of the ninth month of the year Wuwu in the Xianfeng era, at the hour of Xu (7-9 PM). He was sixty-three years old. With his talent, he bathed in the sun and moon, and his capacity was as vast as the sea and the earth, without limit. His learning encompassed all schools of thought, and he incorporated historical events and evidence into his writing. In an instant, he created myriad things, naturally. At times, his work was like decaying ghosts and burning gods, strange and bizarre. Throughout history, only Li Bai and Su Shi can be compared to him in terms of talent. He once described his life in a poem, saying that the "four souls" he collected were mostly related to national heritage, and the "ten peaks" he visited were Qingcheng, Emei, Zhongnan, Putuo, Kuanglu, Tai, Heng, Dawei, Tiantong, and Luofu, each forming a collection. He also said that his hobbies were mountains and waters, and women, and that if he had mountains and waters, he would forsake women, a hint of spiritual ambition that came from within. In all, he left behind seventy-two volumes of poetry, ten volumes of ci poetry, and twenty-three volumes of historical and miscellaneous writings. Including collections of poems exchanged with others, there are more than sixty kinds. Eighteen or nineteen of these were published. In the last six years, his poetry manuscripts were lost to others and were occasionally seen in newspapers and periodicals. He lived with utmost integrity and had no pretensions to life, death, wealth or nobility. He was trustworthy to his friends and courageous in his actions. Although he was subject to slander and ridicule, he never complained or blamed others. He was persevering, upright, and knew when to stop. He can be said to have sought benevolence. His wife was Liu Jingdong, the granddaughter of a Hunan provincial governor. Their son died young. His second wife was Shen, daughter of Shen Baoxiang, the prefect of Hanyang, from Wuxing. Both sons died young, and both wives were granted the title of Lady. His concubine was Wang, and their sons are Jia Chui, Jia Yue, and Jia Zhu. Zhu died before him. His concubine was Li, and their daughter married a certain grandson of Qu Guoxian of Baojing. He has several granddaughters. On a certain day of a certain month in the year Dingmao, the coffin was returned and buried in the mountains of Hanshou. I had been connected to him by marriage for more than three generations. In the past, he sent me a poem, in which he wrote that if he had an epitaph in future, he would want me to write it. Now, the tomb trees have grown, but there is no inscription. This is my responsibility. In recent years, I have been living in exile on the coast. His younger brother, Shun Yu, and his son, Jia Yue, came one after another, urgently requesting that I fulfill my promise. Therefore, I have examined his deeds and composed this inscription: Valiant in the restoration, illustrious among the Hunan scholars. Beyond the lake, there are three changes, like Su of Dongpo. His father was a teacher, and his administration was benevolent. The wise king called him, calling him "little sage." His talent was benevolent, and he was filial to heaven. Jin Xiong and Tang Chong, he emulates them. He was filial and able to govern, and he was loyal and able to harmonize. He submitted ten thousand words to the throne, but the book was burned and not destroyed. He held the flag on the Yellow River, fighting with one heart against the Red Cliff. The waves could not gnaw at him, his benevolence was like a rock. He traveled ten thousand miles to the wilderness, to Jiaozhi in the south. Proclaiming our emperor's benevolence, he disregarded life and death. The turtle overturned, the pillar broke, there was no end to the return. He redeemed it with poetry, a vast talent. Dry evil, Kun evil, don't bury your pain. Enough, no resentment, share with those who come. Who knows your pain? Only Heaven knows your benevolence. One hut contains all things, changing bodies for a thousand years. Beautiful is that hill, the image is only a ball. I examine the inscription, it will not be erased for ten thousand years.</p>

<h3>Financial Gold Prices Plunge Violently</h3>
<p>▲ Due to an Abundance of Cash</p>
<p>▲ A Sharp Drop of Twenty-Five Mace Per Tael</p>
<p>▲ Utter Panic Yesterday, on February 11th, the gold market continued its frantic decline. The situation was perilous, volatile, and highly turbulent. In an instant, there were price swings of several to ten taels, an unstoppable trend. People were in a state of utter panic. The difference between the morning and afternoon markets reached sixteen or seventeen taels, making the market unpredictable and chaotic. In the end, there was a drastic drop of more than twenty taels. This was due to the easing of both official and unofficial foreign exchange rates. Official exchange rates had already widened by one and a half points. The selling pressure in the market intensified. In the morning market, companies like Fuchang, Yongfeng, Yuanheng, and Yuansheng all sold off, while Yuanmao, Yongbing, Xingtai, and Kangrun bought in. Overseas silver markets had rebounded. As a result, gold prices plummeted by more than ten taels at the opening. Subsequently, due to a severe shortage of Shanghai banknotes, the sixty-tael mark was briefly broken before drifting erratically, lingering around the sixty-tael level. However, banknote rates seemed to have stabilized. Later in the day, major players like Yuansheng, Yuanmao, Yongfu, and Changfu tended to sell, mainly because the swap date was approaching. Overall, due to the abundance of cash and the need for bulls to pay premiums, many parties took the opportunity to sell off. As a result, market prices continued to decline, eventually breaking through the 750-tael mark, almost without any chance of recovery. Afterwards, bears made some covering purchases, and the market eased slightly, briefly rising above the fifty-tael level. However, with price swings of ten taels, the market seemed to be shrouded in a fog. It was said that foreign exchange rates might continue to rise this morning because it was Wednesday, a day of low trading volume.</p>
<p>▲ Plunge at the Open The March contract opened with a drop of 11.5 taels, priced at 760 taels. This was because the major exchanges rose by 5/16ths, forward rates rose by 1/4, and silver prices rose by 3/4. The European market was very strong, and there was renewed buying interest from the United States, with few sellers. As a result, market sentiment was weak. Private telegraphic transfers increased by 7/8ths yesterday, reaching 59 taels. Subsequently, due to buying by Yuanmao Yong and hedging traders, the price briefly rose to 63.5 taels. Soon after, Yongfeng and Yuancheng sold off, mainly because the exchange rate was weak. Sterling could be settled at 1.25625, and it was known that advance orders had to be priced higher. As a result, there was a sharp drop of 12 taels. When the advance order was announced to be 375 higher for sterling, 75 higher for US dollars, and 4.75 lower for Japanese yen, the price fell to 51.5 taels. Immediately, it rose by another 7 or 8 taels, as March sterling could be purchased at 1.25. Mitsui absorbed April US dollars at 29.4375, and Yucheng, Yongzhi, Feng, Yongfu, and Yu and other companies bought in. At 9:40 AM, the price was 59.5 taels. Later, Fuchang, Yuanheng, Hengxing, Yu, Yongfeng, and other companies sold off, and banks traded short-term US dollars at 29.125, causing the market to decline. By 10:30 AM, the price had fallen to 57 taels, with price swings of 3 or 4 taels in between. Afterwards, Yuanxing, Yongheng, Xingyuan, Yuhe, and other companies chased the market higher. Sterling seemed stable, and Hua Bi absorbed this month at 1.2375. It also traded with Dehua for May at 3.125, causing the gold price to jump by 6 taels. At 11:15 AM, the price was 63 taels. After that, sellers became active, with Yongfeng, Fuchang, Yuanheng, and others competing to sell, suppressing the price by more than 7 taels in half an hour. At 11:45 AM, the price was 55.5 taels. Soon after, it rose by more than 5 taels, with Xinhang and Bingxing buying in, reaching 61 taels. At noon, the price closed at 58.5 taels, and the official price was revised to 833.4 taels, a reduction of 82 to 70 taels.</p>
<p>▲ Irreversible Decline The afternoon market opened at 57.5 taels. Subsequently, due to Yuanmao Yong, Xinhang, Yuancheng, Fuchang, and others aggressively selling off, and due to reports of higher Indian exchange rates, market sentiment was fearful, resulting in a frantic drop of 10 taels. By 2:15 PM, the price had broken through 50 taels, reaching only 47 taels. After that, the price fluctuated without settling. After 3:00 PM, the market suddenly reversed upwards, due to Taikang Run, Zhifeng, Yong Bingxing, and others buying in, driving the price up by 8 or 9 taels. By 4:00 PM, the price was 55.5 taels. After that, selling pressure increased again, causing the market to weaken again. At the closing at 4:30 PM, the price was 51 taels, a drastic drop of 25 taels compared to the previous day. The price later traded around 53 taels. The highest price of the day was 63.5 taels, and the lowest price was 47 taels, a difference of 16.5 taels. The opening price for goods was 62.5 taels, the noon closing price was 58 taels, the afternoon price was 58.5 taels, and the closing price was 53.5 taels. The official price was adjusted to reflect a reduction of a small 76 to 86 taels, then later 82 to 83 taels. The booked price was 54 taels and 59 taels, and the supplementary water price was 54 taels. The afternoon price was 46 taels.</p>
<p>▲ Heavy Selling Pressure In inter-dealer trading, Yongfeng, Yuancheng, Yuanheng, Fuchang, Hengxing Yuan, and Yuan Xingyong were all sellers. Zhifeng Yong, Dadecheng, Yuanmao Yong, Yuantai, and Xinhang had fluctuating positions. Shunli and Wanxing were sellers and buyers at different times. Yuhe, Yucheng Yong, Hengyu, Bingxing, Tong Taichang, and Hengxing were all buyers. In the afternoon, Taikang Run, Bingxing, Hengyu, Wanxing, and Fuli were all buyers. Yuancheng, Yuan Xingyong, Fuchang, Yuanmao Yong, and Xinhang were all sellers. Zhifeng Yong was a seller and then a buyer. Dadecheng had many fluctuations. The Dalian gang bought a total of 1,500 bars and sold over 800 bars. Transactions by the Guangdong gang were scarce.</p>
<p>▲ Holiday Issue The Gold Exchange will be closed on the afternoon of the 16th and on the 17th and 18th of this month. It is expected that all banks and money shops will also be closed on the 17th and 18th, and will resume normal business on the 19th.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Slightly Looser Officially, Stable Unofficially</h3>
<p>Yesterday, sterling, US dollar, Indian, and silver markets all reported gains. The sterling-US dollar exchange rate fell. The European market showed signs of strength.

As for the domestic market, it was initially loose and chaotic, but later seemed to stabilize, with only fluctuations. Because the gold market was very volatile, with price swings of ten taels, the situation could not be contained. However, in the end, there was a sharp drop of 20 taels. At the noon closing, sterling was 1875 higher compared to the previous night, the US dollar was 375 higher, and the Japanese yen was 2.75 lower. In the afternoon, due to Wednesday's usual low trading volume, commercial transactions were less active than on the previous day, with only a small number of receipts and payments.

The spot price rose due to Indian covering, and the market was calm. After the closing, the US tended to buy and there was a lack of accounts, making the market stronger.

The Reuters and Dentsu reports in the morning were uneventful.</p>
<h3>Call Loan Market Remains Sluggish, Guangdong Small Coin Rises Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the exchange rate for foreign silver coins in the morning was 7 mace, 2 fen, 0 hao, and 75 li, and in the afternoon was 7 mace, 2 fen, 0 hao, and 875 li. The result was the same as the previous day. In the morning and afternoon, the silver call loan market continued to do white loans, and no additional interest was added for overnight loans, even white overnight loans, and there was no interest in asking. Foreign exchange transactions were made. In the morning, exchange drawing funds were 973,000 yuan, and banknotes were 30,000. In the afternoon, exchange drawing funds were 1,035,000 yuan, and banknotes were 25,000. Outside the market, banknote transactions were 135,000 yuan in the morning and 75,000 yuan in the afternoon. Bank interbank trading was 400,000 in the morning and 600,000 in the afternoon. Due to the extended hours for silver and money shops to settle various silver coins and foreign currencies, it was impossible to accurately calculate. It was only heard that remittance funds from various sources exceeded 1.5 million yuan, foreign currency funds exceeded 700,000 yuan, and withdrawals exceeded 1.8 million yuan. Small money shops redeemed banknotes and sold exchange headers totaling 700,000 to 800,000 yuan. Banks collected and issued more than 2 million yuan in banknotes. The market for auxiliary coins showed that Jiangnan small silver coins rose by 3 li, reaching 6 mace, 7 fen, and 95 li in the morning and 6 mace, 8 fen, and 1 li in the afternoon.

Transactions were 125,000 jiao in the morning and 90,000 jiao in the afternoon. Copper coins rose by 3,000, reaching 345,000 wen.</p>
<h3>Extensive Silver Coin and Foreign Currency Settlements Extend Hours</h3>
<p>Commercial customs place great emphasis on the lunar calendar for year-end settlements. Therefore, although there were extensive inflows and outflows during the lunar New Year in the past, there are still more than at the current lunar New Year. Since the government issued an order to allow reconciliation until February 16, the business community no longer regards the national calendar settlement as important. Therefore, it is stipulated that the deadline is in mid-February. Now, the deadline is approaching, and all accounts must be reconciled and finalized. The silver and money industries, which hold the key to Shanghai's commercial finance, are particularly busy. In the past, a notice was issued to extend the ticket collection time by 2 hours, starting on February 10 (the day before yesterday), with a deadline of 4:00 PM. Therefore, it is difficult to normally calculate the detailed amounts of money industry settlements during these few days.</p>
<h3>Securities and Bond Prices Continue to Fall by Several Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market conditions for various public bonds in Shanghai showed that spot trading remained light, with a total of 27,500 yuan traded throughout the day. Futures trading activity was quieter than before, with a total of 6.69 million yuan. The 20-year cigarette bonds, the 19-year welfare bonds, and the demobilization bonds were more active, accounting for 1.34 million yuan each. The 19-year customs bonds reached 1 million yuan, and the reorganization bonds were only over 600,000 yuan. Although various other bonds were also listed, transactions were still scarce. The trend of various bond prices remained stable, fluctuating without major increases or decreases in both the morning and afternoon markets. However, as selling was more active than buying, prices were weaker than the previous day, with declines of 2 to 3 jiao each. However, financial futures continued to rise by 7 jiao, and demobilization spot bonds also continued to rise slightly.</p>

<h3>Yarn Market Morning Weak, Evening Strong</h3>
<p>The yarn market opened lower in the morning and rose in the afternoon, with an overall firm trend. Bullish sentiment remained strong, and traders were unwilling to let go. In the afternoon, rumors circulated in the market that the increased special margin requirement for buyers might be canceled, leading to a rush of purchases by retail investors. Japanese traders tightened their pulling force on the spot market, further intensifying the upward trend. The yarn market, being closely linked to the cotton market, rebounded due to fundamental difficulties in declining. However, Japanese traders still showed no intention to cover their large short positions. Some claimed that there were ample yarn stocks in Shanghai, and they feared that the yarn market might be weaker than the cotton market if sales remained sluggish next spring.</p>
<p>▲Human Label Trend Still Stable The human label market opened with a decline due to rising U.S. cotton prices and fluctuating exchange rates, causing retail investors to sell and close positions. Prices fell between 3.48 cents and 1.68 dollars. The afternoon opening was quiet, but the market quickly rebounded due to the surge in cotton prices and rumors of the cancellation of special margin requirements. Sellers were scarce, and prices rose between 3.5 cents and 1.35 dollars. Total transactions amounted to 24,650 bales. Yuda sold 2,600 bales, Fuhe 1,000 bales, Yichang 2,000 bales, Shengtai 550 bales, and Mingde 850 bales. Gongtai bought 2,100 bales, Xincheng 2,550 bales, and Heshen 750 bales. The closing prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Human Label Closing Prices, Gains/Losses, and Open Interest</p>
<p>February: 1643, down 1, 23,900 May: 1695, 2,000</p>
<p>March: 1663, up 2, 47,900 June: 1696, up 3, 43,200</p>
<p>April: 1680, up 3, 55,050 July: 1697, up 7, 3,100</p>
<p>▲Spot Sales Only Average Spot yarn sales remained average. Total purchases by various groups were 245 bales, with 10 bales traded among local merchants. Prices were stable. Among out-of-town merchants, 75 bales were sold to the interior, 120 bales to Hong Kong, 15 bales to Ningbo, 15 bales to Tianjin, 10 bales to Shantou, and 10 bales to Guangdong.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Initially Fell, Then Rose</h3>
<p>The cotton market initially fell but then rebounded. However, overseas cotton markets rose, and exchange rates eased slightly, leading some to lean towards short selling. Nevertheless, Japanese traders maintained a strong stance, and their pulling force was tight. Many others echoed this sentiment. Due to the inability to import foreign cotton and the shortage of raw cotton supply, buyers flocked in as soon as prices fell. Sellers appeared like frightened birds, and their strength was weak. In conclusion, the world has not yet reached a cotton famine. If exchange rates can ease, foreign cotton can be imported. The future depends on exchange rate fluctuations.</p>
<p>▲This Month's Han Label Rose Nearly Half a Dollar The Han label market opened firm due to rising U.S. and Indian cotton prices. Later, gold prices fell, and market sentiment eased, resulting in a decline of 6.8 cents.

<h3>Grain: Hexia Rice Market Gradually Firms</h3>
<p>▲Zhabei Yesterday, the supply of rice from inland areas was scarce, due to the impending closure of rice shops in Shanghai, which discouraged inland merchants from shipping rice to Shanghai. A few sellers were still trying to raise prices, but the inventory in Hexia remained abundant, and buyers were looking to release their holdings. As a result, the market only firmed slightly. High-quality northern japonica rice remained scarce, and wholesale prices were generally better by ten cents, showing a promising trend. Sales of thin indica rice were sluggish, and prices remained unchanged. Arrivals of lamb indica rice were limited, and warehouse owners were hoarding and raising prices, leading to continued price increases. Top-grade rice required 12.20 dollars, while Du Jian and Bu Jian rice remained stable, with normal trading. Reports on the production of rice from Bianyuan Yin Hua were excellent, but local buying interest was weak, and trading volume was limited, so prices barely held steady.</p>
<p>▲Hunan Yesterday, very few boats arrived from various groups. Sales in the local market were not very brisk. Changshu Northern Japonica and Sutongji Northern Japonica initially benefited from the previous day's momentum and firmed up, but then became sluggish due to slow sales. Nevertheless, the price still increased by about half a foot. Southern merchants were eager to sell their thin early rice, but buying interest was still decent, and prices rose by nearly ten cents. Supplies of lamb Du Jian rice remained scarce, and traders and shops made small purchases, leading to a tight market. High-quality white yuan rice was sluggish, while mid-range rice was active, and overall prices remained stable. Daily transactions in various stalls were not sparse.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Shanghai Factories Use European Firms to Suppress Prices and Hoard</h3>
<p>Yesterday, silk transactions in Shanghai's foreign firms remained slow. Overseas raw silk prices were low, and Shanghai factories still considered the prices too high after sending telegrams, resulting in limited telegram exchanges. Although European firms suppressed prices and hoarded, factories found it difficult to sell at a loss. Yesterday, only Lianna and others imported 20 bales of Shanghai White Raw Silk, and Gong'an and others imported 20 bales of White Dry Raw Silk. Kejiang imported 10 bales of Yellow Coarse Silk, with prices remaining stable and weak.</p>
<h3>Double Cocoon Silk Continues to Show Strength</h3>
<p>Since local merchants started purchasing double cocoon silk in the interior, the market in Shanghai has become lively, and the supply of double cocoons cannot meet demand. Prices have also been gradually rising. Although the spring sales season has passed, the inventory of double cocoons is limited, and asking prices remain strong. Yesterday, the Shuang Gong Factory imported 84 dan of double cocoons from a remote area at a price of 65 dollars, and the market continued to show a strong trend.</p>
<h3>Needle Eyebrow Green Tea Sales to France Become Smooth</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in Shanghai's foreign tea market, Yongxing Tongfu and other firms showed strong interest in Needle Eyebrow Green Tea from Luzhuang and Tuzhuang. Total transactions were over 350 boxes, with average selling prices and firm prices. Jinlong Xiehe and other firms also showed some interest in Luzhuang's Zhenmei Green Tea, but negotiations often failed due to low prices from overseas. Gongxi Xiamei and other items had no transactions in the market yesterday.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Lead Prices Soar</h3>
<p>Lead prices have soared recently, with each dan estimated at 16.5 taels, an increase of more than two taels compared to before. It is said that the reason for the price increase is the impact of the sharp increase in the fixed price, and the increase in taxes and duties also has some impact.</p>
<h3>Huisi Iron Arrived Yesterday, 3,000 Boxes</h3>
<p>3,000 boxes of 200-pound Huisi iron arrived yesterday at Pudong Qichang Warehouse, which helped maintain the market that was about to run out of stock. It is reported that Anli, Weili, Jiecheng and other firms will have more large batches arriving at the end of this month, so the market outlook is expected to be more active.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous News: 900 bales of Huzhou silk will be shipped to Lyon tomorrow.</p>
<p>▲Five pieces of silk waste will be shipped to Marseille.</p>

<p>Book and Newspaper Introduction</p>
<h3>Contradiction - Tang Bin</h3>
<p>The nationalist literary movement has become a powerful mainstream trend in the Chinese literary world. This is undeniable. Although there are not many nationalist creative novels that appear before us, most of them are rare masterpieces, unlike Proletarian writers who produce a large number of so-called shallow proletarian works, which make us feel that their rudeness is like slogans, with no artistic value at all, disregarding the essence of literature. Therefore, this kind of shallow and rude work cannot have the permanence of literature and will soon decline. The theoretical foundation of nationalist literary theory has been established and consolidated. This is a very obvious fact, because it has a solid foundation in theory. Although the nationalist literary movement has only appeared in the Chinese literary world for a very short time, its creation has been so mature. Although it cannot be said to have reached the highest peak of art, its technology is different from that of some shallow and rude proletarian works, and readers with considerable appreciation ability can probably understand this.</p>
<p>Pioneer Monthly is a powerful periodical of nationalist literature. It has now published three issues, and each issue is very rich in content. In addition to publishing a large number of theoretical and critical articles, it is particularly inclined to nationalist literary creation. Although it is not a large amount in quantity, we admire it in quality, because each article is the author's carefully crafted work, which shows the strictness of the editor in selecting creations.</p>
<p>Here, we want to recommend Li Zanhua's works as the most skilled in terms of technology. The article "Contradiction" published in this issue is a rare work in the domestic creative world. In form, it is not as rude as proletarian works, and in words, it is not as shallow, but it contains national . We can see the greatness of nationalist literary creation.</p>
<p>The content of the story "Contradiction" is very simple. It is about Yan Qiao, a clerk in a foreigner's office, being questioned by the pig-like supervisor for secretly forming a association. Young people's temperament is inherently strong, but for the sake of livelihood, they have to submit to the claws of foreigners. Here, the author wants to express that there are contradictions everywhere in the current world. With this kind of inextricable contradiction, people can feel the need for revolution. This is a very obvious fact.</p>
<p>The author's writing is very skilled. In the organization of each word and sentence, we can see his efforts in deliberation, so we always feel that what the author writes contains contradictory will. This is something that people without sufficient literary cultivation cannot do. At the beginning of this article, the author powerfully expresses:</p>
<p>The air in the office is always so dull and so thick, as if it is a solidified fog. This fog seems to be separated from the outside world into two worlds. It is so violent that he rushes in and retreats quickly...</p>
<p>Such sentences are so skillful, and such meaning is so deep. Readers can always understand it. I think that it is definitely not something that ordinary creations can express so powerfully. It is even more beyond the reach of proletarian works.</p>
<p>Then, it is written that the pig-like person is so solemn and uses a heavy attitude towards lower-level employees such as Yan Qiao. When he walks into the office staggeringly and flips through the thin records, some are signed immediately, but some make him frown and throw them aside. At this time, the employees inevitably have a burst of panic and unease, and their anxious hearts feel that his face is so heavy and they are so small. Here, we can understand that a person's psychology has contradictory phenomena floating and sinking, and at the same time, there are contradictions everywhere in the current world. This pig-like person calls Yan Qiao to his room to question him. Here, Yan Qiao walks into the world of imagination from the flat ground.</p>
<p>Yan Qiao feels restrained and unnatural in the world of imagination. He doesn't know where to put his body. The white, fat, pig-like person points to the chair in front of him for him to sit on. He bends his waist and sits down, understanding that this world belongs to others. The author's expression is so powerful and light, making us feel angry. Why don't we stand up and make a revolution for our Chinese nation? At the same time, the author is instilling a large amount of upward consciousness. This suggestive power is full of literary factors. If a proletarian writer were to describe it, it would definitely turn into a rude shout, promoting some revolutionary doctrine for a certain class.</p>
<p>Of course, we have no freedom when we eat under the control of foreigners. Therefore, we feel that the Chinese nation is suffering from foreign oppression very seriously. Here, the author reveals it in a very light style, for example:</p>
<p>"Freedom? You go be free. The foreign manager wants to fire people yesterday, why don't you understand?"</p>
<p>It's better to be fired. It's not the way to go on like this with a dying will. He intends to answer with such words, but in this other world, the courage of the young man disappears.</p>
<p>This, the author clearly tells us that we cannot get freedom under the control of foreigners, but for various reasons, we dare not resist, and we also understand that this is the weakness of young people. This has already become a contradiction. Later, the author's expression is even more powerful, encouraging us to fight for the Chinese nation:</p>
<p>He thought that he himself was a young man who had gone through the revolutionary upsurge. He knew that it was a big mistake to break into such a cage. In the past two years, his courage has been much depressed. Why should I jump out of our era? Why can I abandon the life and death of the nation and spend these two years of muddled life? Watching the courage gradually turn into powder under the grind of life, watching everything of the young people disappear, can I be willing to do this?</p>
<p>Really, these are extremely meaningful words. If young people have such reflections, our Chinese nation will definitely flourish soon. This is an indestructible fact. The highest hope is just to be like that pig-like person, smiling at foreigners and staring at his own people. A Chinese puts his hope on this, which is really the most hopeless and too pitiful. This is another kind of artistic technique, which can also arouse our anger. Young people should cheer up and work hard for our Chinese nation. A great literary work must have ups and downs. Ordinary descriptions cannot express the value of art. Even so, the reader will feel a monotonous meaning. Then, the author directly depicts it: "He thought of that pig-like person, his eyes were about to shoot out fire. He had endured his insults for two years, and he had lost his entire freedom under his restraints. The pig-like person taught him not to be a person, taught him to endure and willingly be a slave, and took thirty-six yuan from his hand every month, as if he had sold everything about himself. However, he was resold to others. This kind of fact, those who work under the control of foreigners can think of it, but cannot express this situation vividly, especially in literary works. From this, we can see that the author's description of the psychology of young people has reached a high level. His analysis of women's psychology, Yan Qiao's wife, is even more realistic and vivid. Due to space limitations, readers can only appreciate its true meaning for themselves.</p>
<p>The entire structure is extremely compact, with almost no branches that can be cut. This is the author's ability to cut. In art, this creation has undoubtedly reached a mature side. Nationalist literary creation has only appeared in the Chinese literary world for a very short time, and it has given us such great achievements. It is really commendable. Compared with the shallow and rude proletarian works, the distance is really like the difference between heaven and earth. This is the fact before us. Nationalist literary works are not produced in large quantities like so-called proletarian works, so the skill of its technique is also a major reason.</p>

<h3>Before and After Graduation 君平</h3>
<p>"Haha, this semester can finally end!"</p>
<p>Bin held a course selection form, ran back from the registrar's office, and said triumphantly,</p>
<p>"What's up, Lao Mi, are you graduating in the winter break?"</p>
<p>"Casually, graduating in three and a half years, saving a semester."</p>
<p>Bin's face was full of smiles, his feet tapping the floor, and all the muscles in his body vibrated.</p>
<p>Originally, Bin still had a year before graduation because he was still short twenty-six credits. According to the school's current regulations, he could only take twenty-two credits in a semester. This time, it was really beyond Bin's own expectations. After telling the provost all kinds of difficulties, the provost actually wrote the words "Special Permission" on his course selection form. Thus, Bin's graduation deadline was also shortened by half a year under the provost's pen.</p>
<p>In Bin's own view, this was indeed a piece of good fortune.</p>
<p>Two months of time passed. Bin saw the notice of the graduate examination period on the president's bulletin board. So, he intensified his work on the graduation thesis, which was already more than half done. After the electric lights went out at night, he raised the tip of his pen under the faint candlelight and scribbled on the paper. He still got up very early in the morning, washed his face, and then continued to scribble with that old-fashioned Parker fountain pen.</p>
<p>With great difficulty, the graduation thesis was completed. A smile often appeared on Bin's face, as if the difficult hurdle before graduation had been overcome, and the future was full of hope. Bin thought that life after graduation would be very different from today.</p>
<p>The next morning, Bin got up, put on his overcoat, and put on his hat, and set off for a photo studio. After arriving at the photo studio, Bin changed into a bachelor's gown, put on a bachelor's cap, and struck a perfect pose, asking the shop assistant to take several photos. At this time, Bin stood in front of the mirror looking at his own image. An unnamed joy suddenly surged from his heart.</p>
<p>A few days later, the apprentice from the photo studio delivered the photos. Bin took them out and looked at them, feeling that everything was okay, but the spirit was a little lacking. This could only be said to be a flaw in the ointment, so there was no need to pursue it. Thus, a layer of amiable smile floated on his face again.</p>
<p>"I should first give one to my most intimate friend,"</p>
<p>Bin sat at his desk thinking, his eyes fixed on the photos in his hand, his face floating with two dimples of wanting to drop a laugh.</p>
<p>"No, I should first pick one from inside to give to my lover," Bin continued thinking,</p>
<p>"Lao Zhang, do you want me to give you one?" Bin's gaze flashed towards me, his face slightly showing a hint of joy, "Don't need it, the photograph of Bachelor Mi."</p>
<p>"Haha, ..............."</p>
<p>Bin laughed involuntarily when he heard me call him "Bachelor Mi."</p>
<p>The day of the graduation examination arrived. Bin walked slowly into the classroom every day with the sound of the bell, and answered casually in the classroom, as if the score had nothing to do with him. At the same time, his behavior seemed somewhat abnormal, and the dimples on his face gradually disappeared.</p>
<p>After the exam, Bin's complexion was different from before the exam. At this time, Bin's face was only filled with depression and annoyance.</p>
<p>Perhaps Bin has already tasted the fun of graduating. In this time of overstaffing, the problem of the way out after graduation is really not easy to solve. Look, how many unemployed college students are there in China now? If we investigate it in detail, this number will really scare us.</p>
<p>Three weeks had passed, and Bin's livelihood problem was still not solved. Yes, everyone has to eat. This, for Bin's future, naturally added a layer of tragic expression to his round face.</p>
<p>One afternoon, Bin received a notice from the secretariat, saying that the president wanted him to go to his house tomorrow morning to talk. Bin thought that he had written a letter to the president a week ago. This time, calling him to talk may be related to his problem of finding a way out. In an instant, he thought again that the president had helped several graduating students find a way out not long ago, and they all have things to do now. Yes, his own problem of finding a way out will definitely be solved in the sound of this conversation. Bin carefully folded the note and put it in his wallet, a slight hint of joy appearing on his face.</p>
<p>The next day, Bin got up especially early, washed his face, and stepped out of the door to head towards the president's house.</p>
<p>When he arrived at the president's house, the president had not yet gotten up. Bin sat in the living room for more than two hours before he saw the president walk out of the room.</p>
<p>"Is that Mi Bin? You came very early," the president said,</p>
<p>"What time did the secretariat's note arrive?" the president continued to ask,</p>
<p>"Yesterday afternoon,"</p>
<p>"At the current time, finding things is really difficult. I wrote three or four letters of introduction for you, but none of them worked out,"</p>
<p>"............" After hearing what the president said just now, Bin felt like a basin of cold water had been poured on him, and the passion that filled his heart completely disappeared.</p>
<p>"Please ask the president to find a way again," After a while, Bin said with a pleading attitude,</p>
<p>"Yes, I will pay attention to it for you all the time,"</p>
<p>Talking to this point, Bin said goodbye to the president and came out. After hesitating on the road for a while, he finally hailed a rickshaw and returned to the school.</p>
<p>In the room, Bin kept his mouth tightly closed and did not speak. "Lao Mi, how was the result of the conversation?" After a while, I asked him, succumbing to curiosity.</p>
<p>"I won't tell you for the time being," Bin said a little bit frustrated, not wanting to answer.</p>
<p>Then, the room fell silent.</p>
<p>"Your life is really interesting, heaven doesn't care, earth doesn't care," After a while, Bin said as he walked, as if he was thinking about something,</p>
<p>"Where is it interesting, graduating is the interesting part."</p>
<p>"Graduating is interesting, yes, that's what people who haven't tasted the taste of graduation say."</p>
<p>"Then, is graduating painful?"</p>
<p>"At least it's not happy. I feel that, especially graduating from university is even more painful."</p>
<p>"Then, at the beginning of the semester, why did you rush to graduate?"</p>
<p>"That was my fantasy before graduation. At that time, I thought that graduating was happy, just like you do now."</p>
<p>…………………………………</p>
<p>Bin and I argued for a while, and finally he won.</p>
<p>Finally, Bin said that the purpose of studying is to serve the society, but the society does not give us the opportunity to serve, so there is only pain after graduation. In fact, I have already understood this truth, but I do not believe that the society is absolutely not giving us the opportunity to serve.</p>
<p>But the fact is placed in front of us, the society is indeed rejecting a group of students who have just come out of university.</p>
<p>It has been more than two months since Bin graduated, and he is still unemployed.</p>
<h3>A Pair of Youths Man Yin</h3>
<p>"Are you leaving tomorrow, Wang?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I'm leaving this place tomorrow, but going to Beijing is still a story for later, because Mr. Li asked me to wait at his house for two days and go with him,"</p>
<p>"Then, I'll come to the North Railway Station to see you off the day after tomorrow, okay?"</p>
<p>"Don't bother, save the trouble,"</p>
<p>"What bothering, this is what should be done, where else can we vagrants find sympathy except in asking each other's friends?" His words seemed to arouse Wang's sadness.</p>
<p>"Ah..." Wang sighed a long breath,</p>
<p>He himself fell even deeper into the sad scene of parting, as if there were infinite sorrows and troubles blocking his heart, making him feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>There was a temporary silence in the room.</p>
<p>The sound of car bells on the road, the sound of loudspeakers and drums in the shops to attract customers, and countless city voices were really a chaotic mess. Slowly, through the transmission of air, they resounded in the room where they lived.</p>
<p>At this time, Wang was bowing his head doing his work, packing his luggage. As for him, in the name of organizing books for Wang, he roughly read the contents of those books like a horse watching flowers. However, his heart had never noticed a single word in the books. He listened to the noisy sounds on the road, like sobbing, like crying, like wailing, like groaning, rising and falling like waves. He couldn't help but feel a great sense of disgust.</p>
<p>In fact, rather than saying that the noise on the road was annoying, it was more appropriate to say that the lonely, boring, and sorrowful atmosphere in the room was suffocating and making people uncomfortable, because the former was lively and energetic, while the latter was gloomy and dead-like melancholy.</p>
<p>Yes, dead-like melancholy. The ancients said that parting in life is the most unbearable time. Aren't they in the time of parting in life at this moment?</p>
<p>He threw the books he was organizing in his hand onto the table, stood up abruptly, and said angrily,</p>
<p>"It's really annoying, these miscellaneous sounds,"</p>
<p>He walked to the window and pushed the unclosed window door hard, meaning to complain about why it didn't isolate the noisy sounds on the road, but let them invade people's hearts in the room. However, the window door stubbornly opened instead because of the resistance. Thus, "ding-dong" "rumbling" all the sounds on the road rushed to knock on his eardrums, and all the "colors" of red and green in the city also penetrated into his eyes. He then stood in front of the window and looked out.</p>
<p>The sky seemed to be as melancholy as his mood. The sun hid behind the clouds, and a gust of cold wind blew in his face. He felt that it was drizzling in the air. Looking down on the road, it was still red and green, pairs of pairs, like ten thousand arrows, wriggling trams, like long snakes, flying cars, like running tigers, and these ten thousand arrows, long snakes, and running tigers seemed to unite to attack him. The chaotic sounds on the road were the sound of the attack, finally making his heart ache and feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>He stood in front of the window in a daze, thinking about the past. He was from Jiang province. After graduating from a certain middle school in Jiang province, he worked in a newspaper office. This occupation was quite in line with his interests, because he liked literature and thought that there would be plenty of writing opportunities in the newspaper office. He couldn't help but be happy. In terms of life, an income of fifty yuan of ocean per month was also enough to spend. However, he finally quit this good job. Here, we can't blame him for his bad temper, or say that he "doesn't know the times." Originally, he was a young man, a young man with blood, who couldn't stand the officials in the newspaper office putting on airs and hating the current reviews and editorials written by those editors who catered to the trend. He felt that this environment was not suitable for him, because if you want to continue to do it for a long time, you have to mess with them. What playing cards, treating guests, and prostitute... are all indispensable social activities in the modern officialdom.</p>
<p>How can this work? If I learn these tricks, then will I still become a young man? Moreover, am I willing to bury my future in such a dirty environment?</p>
<p>No, no, I want to leave this place, leave this life that is very well-off, but the environment is very bad, reporter, life, for my career, for my future,</p>
<p>Go, go to the seaport,</p>
<p>Since he started working in the newspaper office, he felt that his knowledge was not enough, and it was necessary to study again. His impoverished family could not provide his tuition fees. He often thought about going to the seaport to work and study at the same time, and he knew that the seaport was the birthplace of modern culture, gathering many literati and scholars. He dreamed that in such a high-level cultural environment, he would definitely be able to get the knowledge, ability, and experience he wanted. He also worried about the livelihood problem, but he thought that it was nothing. There are many factories in the seaport. As long as you can endure hardship, if you can't find a suitable job, you can work in the factory. He firmly believed that a young man, a pure, faithful, and ambitious young man, would never be abandoned by the society. "If you can't sell brainpower, then sell physical strength," he often said.</p>
<p>So he came to the seaport.</p>
<p>Before setting off in Jiangbu, he also returned to his hometown, which was three hundred miles away from Jiangbu, to say goodbye to his old parents, saying that their son was going on a long journey.</p>
<p>"A friend in the seaport has found a good position for you, is that right?" The father, who was over fifty years old and often exhorted to earn money to support the family, asked, because he was studying, and the family still owed hundreds of dollars in debt.</p>
<p>"Yes, father, a friend in the seaport wrote a letter asking me to go," he lied to his father.</p>
<p>"In my opinion, it's best not to go, son, the seaport is too far away, and the age is not good. It's better to work in the newspaper office in this province. The place is closer, and people are also familiar with it. It's better to slowly seek development in the future," his loving mother said,</p>
<p>"You women don't know what to do," the father said, "A man has ambition in all directions, and the world is his home. As long as a friend in the seaport asks him to go, why not go? What are you doing by just guarding the local area?" Although the parents were comforting each other like this, when it came time to part with their son, he said, "Dad, Mom, I'm leaving,"</p>
<p>"Okay, you go, be careful on the road," it was his father's trembling voice,</p>
<p>"Don't forget your home, son, write a letter back when you get there, so that your mother won't worry," his mother shed tears,</p>
<p>He deeply understood the parents' love for their son, which cannot be described in words.</p>
<p>With the development of transportation in the 20th century, a journey of more than three thousand miles only takes three days by ship. He came to the seaport from Jiangbu. When he first arrived in the seaport, he was quite surprised. A naive child from the countryside suddenly mixed into this second Paris in the East seaport. The great warship, the towering foreign houses, the wide roads, the bustling streets, and the beautiful women with colorful dresses, he couldn't help but spread out the stuffy air that had been accumulated in Jiangbu for a long time, and tried his best to find the source of his life and pursue his ultimate destination in the embrace of this big city. He wants to work hard, he wants to move forward, he wants to shake up his spirit and walk on the road of life with big strides...</p>
<p>......Time flew by for three months. What was the result of his efforts to move forward? Besides disappointment, grinding, what he got was nothing but insults, ridicule, poverty, freezing and starvation...... At first, he went to apply for advertisements on newspapers that were recruiting staff and was rejected. He wanted to sell articles and write manuscripts, but he was either ignored by the editors, or "This journal is suspended, and your manuscript will be returned." Finally, he went to the factory to find work, but he was stubbornly designated by the factory staff as a suspected worker movement person. "Is this how society treats a young man so cruelly?" He often sighed and hated, and it was even more common to fall into the abyss of disappointment and cry sadly. His brain was originally a bit neurotic, and even then he lost the ability to organize and self-control, sometimes crying, sometimes laughing, causing the girls of the second landlord to laugh at him, saying that he was "crazy." Of course, he could no longer concentrate on reading and working hard to write. All day long, he just curled up in a small booth and slept. When his mind was hot, he ran to the road. One day, two days, a week, ...... that's how it passed. His body was not very strong to begin with, and recently, because of dietary imbalances, or to put it bluntly, starvation, he became thin and weak. Now he understands that all the prosperity and liveliness of the seaport are of no benefit to a poor, unfamiliar vagrant, except to make you angry, hate, curse, and even cry sadly......</p>
<p>If he were forced to say what the benefits of coming to the seaport for three months were, then he could not help but mention Mr. Kuang, as well as Wang, whom he met through Mr. Kuang's introduction, the Wang who was about to separate.</p>
<p>Mr. Kuang is a famous socialite in the seaport, who has helped him a lot in terms of spirit and material. This, in Mr. Kuang</p>
