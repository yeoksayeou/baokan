<p>時評</p>
<h3>民衆慰勞馬將軍之心理</h3>
<p>黑龍江省代主席馬占山將軍以絕塞之孤軍。抗狼虎之暴日。落日孤城。而壯氣衝天。艱苦作戰。卒使暴軍望而却步。其通告全國之電文。慷慨激昻。可歌可泣。守土盡責。大義凛然。「疾風知勁草。板蕩識誠臣。」此誠無忝於我國家之好軍人。無愧於我民族之好男兒。此誠足爲喚起我古國民族精神之木鐸。　　日來全國各地民衆團體。以及私人。爲鼓勵馬部之忠勇將士。并予以實力上之救援。多自動捐集鉅欵。匯黑慰勞。甚至販夫苦力。亦出其血汗。踴躍捐輸。至於慰勞激勵之文電。則更如雪片紛飛。輿論之所集。皆推馬將軍爲民族之武力。爲軍人之模楷。雖三尺童子。亦都知孤軍抗禦暴日之馬占山其人。</p>
<p>從此種事實輿論中。吾人應即可以窺見眞實之民意。即人民對於軍人之要求與希望。在於衛國。在於保民。在於捍衛侵害我民族之寇患。能盡此責任者。即爲人民之武力。即爲人民所竭誠擁護。</p>
<p>邇年以來。國内變亂不絕。每次籌措軍餉。人民無不疾首蹙額。於無可奈何之中。勉力應承。此蓋爲不可否認之事實。但對於此次抗禦暴日之馬軍。則自動踴躍捐輸。如恐不及。節衣縮食。出諸至誠。於此更可見民視最明。民聽最聰。萬目睽睽之下。明辯是非。最爲公正。毫無偏袒。蓋人民之所取以判别是非者。爲實質之事實而非口頭上之宣傳也。</p>
<p>我全國軍人在此種事實敎訓之下。兹後當有以認清本身之職責。并認清其當前所應負之使命。凡眞能捍國守土克盡厥職之軍人。人民雖肝腦塗地。竭其生命。以爲其後盾。亦所不惜。今日我國家已處於最後之存亡綫上。人民且已具最後犧牲之决心。奮起衝向前陣。爲公理正義以及民族之生存而搏鬥。此爲最後之時機。若先周詳考慮。躊躇於萬一戰敗之足以亡國。先自餒氣。而無寗爲玉碎不爲瓦全之精神與决心者。國乃必亡。故今日我全國將士。應急踵馬將軍之忠勇而奮起。全體人民。已準備毁家毁身。作最後之奮鬥。</p>

<p>（巴黎）　今日國聯理事會第一次會議時、議長法外長白里安於致開會辭後、即將中日遼吉爭執事件、從首至尾宣讀一遍、並日人在九月十月接受决議案之諾言、及中國施總代表轉致中國國民政府遵守决議案之函、白氏復謂國聯理事會仍當設法和平解决中日爭執案件、旋於四時三十分閉幕後、乃進行秘密討論會議、（十七晨二時國民電）</p>

<p>（日内瓦）　今日衆料滿洲難題將僅在大處着手處理、至於與此有關之各種問題、非一時所可解决、十月廿四日行政會議决案請中日兩國政府於日軍撤退後開始直接談判、除日本外、行政會一致通過之、可見行政會固承認中日交涉非撤兵所能完全解决之也、是以須提出有效力的擔保、以確定此難題之和平解决、行政會若能供給此項擔保、則有大功於全世界、以言美國合作、無論美國加入行政會議席與否、當無區别、因美國在對此難題謀取和平解决法之工作中、定與行政會有密切之合作也、（十五日路透社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　法國外交部將於今日午後四時啓門、國聯之正戲、將於半小時後開始、集中於滿洲問題、雖對手兩方即中日兩國依然未變、而劇中之人物已稍有更動、有若干方面現以爲白里安之態度、因法國參謀部之壓力、或將稍變、縱極同情於國聯、然不能不依政府之意旨而行事也、西門爵士以英外相之資格初次出塲、大爲羣衆注意、今晨與白里安談三刻鐘、全用法語、英法皆希望本星期杪可得解决中日爭端之折中辦法、衆料中日代表在行政會討論之初、不免有一塲舌戰、但終可趨於温和、庶中國日本與國聯之命運、皆可保全、國聯方面以爲日本除軍閥外、尙有平民之大利益在焉、滿案之解决、與平民有莫大之利益、希望日本終可側重於平民方面云、各代表團今日全日極形活動、現有兩種談判正在同時進行中、一爲白里安之忙於草定今日午後開會手續、希望開會時間不長、但恐非易事也、白里安之演詞、定屬一種止痛劑之性質、但中日代表將繼續發言、其言或甚長也、一爲關於總問題之談判、美大使道威斯在此項磋商中、甚爲活動、雖目前尙不能云及任何切實方案、但衆料或有「新道威斯計畫」出現、以解此目前難關也、道威斯復訪松平、午後將商諸西門爵士、白里安除籌備開會外、亦參加此種談話、西門語白里安、星期四日或須返倫敦、出席於内閣重要會議、如屆時中日爭端仍無解决、則渠即可再至巴黎云、（十六日路透電）</p>

<h3>施肇基訪晤各國代表</h3>

<p>（巴黎）　中國施總代表今日會晤美大使道威斯日大使松平、其時距理事會重開時間不過數小時、事後施氏語人謂美大使道威斯並不欲向理事會提出折衷辦法、道氏告渠美政府未曾擬有折衷方案、蓋目下無所謂折衷、日軍非退則留、日本自九月三十日以來、一再允諾將軍隊撤回滿鐡附屬地、况又受理事會十月間議案之拘束、故中國認理事會今日會議、乃日本與國聯間事、此項問題非常明瞭、日本必須撤回其軍隊、否則取消其對國聯之諾言、中國將仍守原來地位接受理事會任何决議、但目下不能有折衷云云、施氏今晨已擬一新宣言、將在下午理事會開會後宣讀、其内容大致係彚述日前迭次報告理事會之日本暴行、（十六日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　中國施總代表又與國聯總秘書德魯蒙會晤、德氏復與美大使道威斯日大使松平相晤、旣而法外長白里安先接見英外相西門、次延見蘇俄大使杜格萊夫斯基、當白杜相晤時、美大使道威斯則與松平作第二次談話、按白氏在兩日内連晤蘇俄大使兩次、言蘇俄對於東三省中日爭執、保持中立之必要、（十六日國民電）</p>
<h3>關於撤兵問題日本對我覆牒</h3>
<p>（東京）　中政府於十一月四日致牒日政府、要求撤退駐滿軍隊、日政府已於今晚以覆牒送致此間中國使署、牒文極長、臚舉各案、以證明中國故意增重滿洲之時局、繼又舉出若干事、以證明中政府與聞全國之抗日運動、繼乃切實聲明十月二十四日國聯之决議案、未得一致之同意、故不能實行、而中國乃要求日本履行該决議案之規定、足徵中國實圖牽强國聯之行動、以求自利、至九月三十日國聯之决議案、並未定有時限、日本固擬照案辦理、但中國未能如此、蓋中國未圖恢復兩國間尋常之關係、且反故意增重時局也、牒文末段於駁十月三十日中國牒文所述各節後、切實聲明非俟中國承認條約之尊嚴、及罷行利用排外運動以達其目的之政策、則遠東和平仍將陷於危險之中云云、（十六日路透社電）</p>
<h3>國聯方面一種奇異提議主張另派東省軍事長官</h3>
<p>（巴黎）　此間現有一種奇異提議、行將提出理事會、其主張係由理事會請中國另派東三省軍事長官、其實力足以剿平土匪、而其人亦爲日人所能接受者、其意以爲日人在東三省有鉅大之財政的實業的及鐡路的利益、自將歡迎一力能剿匪之軍事長官、故此舉當比派遣國聯軍事委員團較易實行云、（十六日國民電）</p>
<h3>歐戰將士會切望和平解决爭端</h3>
<p>法國咸斯城歐戰戰士會通過議案云多數國家如德英奥美意法葡萄牙等國、所有曾經參戰與受殘害者羣集此間、互相携手、足見世間利用目前政治經濟上之困難、而刺戟各民族使之互相仇視者、實爲輿論所不容、此城前因戰爭大受破壞、頃始修復、參戰戰士集會於此、其共同志願、厥爲國際間棄嫌修好、而各民族在有組織之和平中、咸皆安全共享正義、并負聯帶責任云云、旋又决定電達白里安云、參戰戰士與受殘害者屬於十二國代表八百萬人、謹向國聯會最高代表即行政院表示拳拳之意、務請依據吾輩在精神上之力量、對於危害和平之爭端予以解决、吾輩坦白爲懷、對於中日兩大國務請其尊重非戰公約、并接受行政院所採取之措置、俾新事變不致發生、而爭端亦得和平解决、（十六日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<h3>國聯前途美國頗抱樂觀</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）　此處國務院官員今日宣稱、彼等對於星期一日在巴黎召集之國聯理事會前途頗爲樂觀、因中日間之爭執、定可得一解决之方也、現日本態度已較前爲緩和、亦爲樂觀原因之一、前傳蘇俄協助中國軍隊之說、現已證明不確、美國官塲方面已覺心安、加以日本一再聲明、不願與蘇俄構成衝突、美人尤爲滿意、將來美國駐英大使道威斯將時時以巴黎會議之情形報告國務院、但道威斯並不參加理事會之討論、故地位與上期理事會會議中之美國觀察員吉爾白氏不同云、（十五日國民電）</p>
<h3>英法方面所傳美國調解方案</h3>
<p>不限期的督促日本撤兵條約問題必要時交公斷</p>
<p>倫敦今日倫敦每日電聞載外交通訊員稿、謂近數日間英外相西門與美大使道威斯日大使松平在倫敦晤商、及法外長白里安與日大使芳澤在巴黎晤商結果、對於東三省事件、已有一折衷解决方案、將於國聯理事、會重開後提出、内容係請日本重踐其撤兵諾言、但不規定時限、由國聯與美國會派中立視察員、監視日軍撤退與華官接收各地、至日本要求中國承認現行條約一層、倘至必要時、將提交海牙法庭公斷云云、現此間雖對於理事會重開後作何行動、紛紛揣測、但官廳方面尙無表示、（十五日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　時報載稱、美國所擬調解辦法、聞將由道威斯將軍加以說明、并相機加以辯護、此項調解辦法内容如何、無人得知、僅有一端不難推測、即一方面須使日本迅速撤退軍隊、一方面中國於日本軍隊盡數撤回南滿鐡路附屬地以前、須與日本開始直接談判（十五日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　據本日傳聞美國有一解决中日爭端草案、其内容如何則言者不詳、一般人以爲此項新計畫、未必於開會之始即行提出、道威斯將軍於談話時表示日本宜從速撤兵之意、謂東京屢有諾言、則撤兵實爲必要、至撤退日軍必須明定期限一層、按之目前滿洲情形是否切要、一般心理咸以美國之意、撤兵在所必行、期限非必限定、至日本要求承認之條約、似係下列之數項、即（一）一九○五年條約及關於滿洲鐡路不相競爭之附帶議定書、（二）一九○九年條約關於日本墊欵所修之中國各鐡路、（三）一九一五年二十一條各項、中國方面則繼續聲明此等條約向無不承認之言、但因此項條約所起之爭端、應由海牙國際法庭審理之云、（十六日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<h3>英報斥責國聯處理不善致引起中日嚴重局面竟有主張停繳會費者</h3>
<p>倫敦今日各方面皆以爲本星期中巴黎所辦之重大事件、成敗在兩可之間、一般人對此時局、咸覺憂慮、報紙批評多責難國聯處理之不善、致起嚴重時局、謂限期撤兵、尤其是期限不長、乃一大錯、何能希望日本依此要求、國聯今必須設法展長時期、以免受辱而免衝突云、惟今晨彚聞報社論、則謂國聯會章第十五條與第十六條給予國聯以處理此種緊要事件之充分權力、國聯應表示有施用任何權力爲維持和平所必要者之膽量、此乃最關重要之點云、（十六日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦每日快報登載社論、謂國聯會已距死期不遠、英國人應要求政府中止繳納會費、（十六日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<h3>國聯威信動搖法報譏我過於信任</h3>
<p>（巴黎）　巴黎辯論報謂國聯行政會之第六十五次會議、在甚暗淡之氣象中開幕、此語可代表法人之觀念、衆覺中國之謎、最令人迷離恍惚者、莫此爲甚、法人輿論不一、竟有認日本在盜匪遍地之地方爲法律與秩序之保障者、有謂中國弱國乞助國聯者、惟無論如何、國聯自己威信刻在搖搖不定之秋、中國雖信任國聯、日本則對於國聯之用處、不能無疑云云、（十五日路透社電）</p>

<h3>玳梁憶語</h3>
<p>— 燕子</p>
<p>遜清光緒中葉。中日因朝鮮而失和。陸軍旣挫於平壤。祇左寳貴殉難。直督李鴻章即令北洋海軍駛往迎戰。海軍提督丁汝昌以陸軍宿將。統領海軍。用非所長。識者早知其必敗。幸德人某爲之佈置禦敵之策。得以整隊啓碇。遇日艦於黄海。其時海軍人材。以閩籍爲夥。粤籍次之。致遠者一千八百噸之砲艦耳。艦長鄧世昌。粤人也。素爲閩籍中人所忌。兩軍旣遇。旗艦鎭遠揚旗發令。巨艦居中。排作一字陣。日艦張兩翼作雁行式。包抄我艦隊。圍鎭遠定遠於中間。砲聲震天。而不敢接近。畏兩艦之巨砲也。戰旣酣。揚威中彈火起。超勇擱淺。經遠沉没。惟致遠雖受日砲擊燬艦面。管帶鄧世昌猶親自發砲擊沉一日艦。殲敵百餘人。後見事不可爲。乃命開足速力。衝撞日艦。以冀同歸於盡詎未達目的。艦已沉没。於是忠勇壯烈之鄧管帶。與二百健兒。同葬身於黄海波濤中。死事之烈。可與左寳貴並垂不朽矣。壯哉鄧世昌。</p>

<h3>佛蘭克林（四）</h3>
<p>小徒弟列傳之一</p>
<p>我没有叙述佛蘭克林從天上奪取電氣之前，先要叙述佛蘭克林時代一般人對於電之見解。</p>
<p>天空中之閃電打雷，自有人類以來，誰都看見過，聽見過。古人遇了這種恐怖的現象便以爲是下界犯罪，所以上帝震怒，差遣雷公電母來收伏妖怪，猛獸，惡人。他們以爲雷電是天神，被天神，打死的都是罪大惡極，犯了天條。中國現在一般愚人，還是這樣的迷信着。佛蘭克林時代的歐美人民對於天然電象也抱有大同小異的見解，往往閙出離奇的笑話。</p>
<p>人造電氣的歷史也很古，但在佛蘭克林以前只是一些零碎而不可以解釋的小把戲。摩擦皮猫生火花，摩擦瑪瑙吸燈草：這種把戲人類至少是要了二千多年。葛雷Stephen　Gray在二百年前開始在倫敦用絲線包繞的幾十丈長的粗繩，將摩擦的電從這一頭通到那一頭。這位葛雷是一位窮老翁，靠活電的把戲賺小孩們的錢，養活自己。黑白分明的寫在紙上說這種火花響聲之性質很像雷電。</p>
<p>法國的都費C.F.Dufay復演葛雷的把戲，能將摩擦的電通過一二五六呎長之線。他是第一個人發現電之兩性，稱爲玻璃電，Vitreous　Eleotricity（即後來所謂之陽電，）和松香電，Resinous　Electricity（即後來所謂之陰電。）他首先發現若使兩種性質的電氣接近，結果是同性相拒，異性相吸</p>
<h3>弱國戰勝强敵之史片</h3>
<p>— 清癯</p>
<p>人有恒言。曰「弱肉强吞」。而不知此特名詞耳。非一定之成局也。國之存亡。亦一國之朝野上下自亡之。而於國無與。一聽人之自擇。昔孟叟謂「若夫豪傑之士。雖無文王猶興。」其詔示我後世有國者之克自樹立。與對抗强隣侵逼之敎訓。亦至深且切。</p>
<p>吾讀春秋。華元曰。「過我而不假道。鄙我也。鄙我亡也。殺其使者。必伐我。伐我亦亡也。亡一也。遂殺楚使。」盲左記此數言。令人誦之。猶懍懍有生氣。偪人眉目者。何也。古人之於國權得喪之際。兢兢若此。而不惜以孤注一擲之舉。爲徒手搏虎之計者。亦以亡國之慘。痛於殺身。其間利害。辨之不容不審。而其最後之成敗。固不遑問已。</p>
<p>由外言之。昔波斯王澤耳士的十萬之衆。圖吞希臘。而留民達士親率壯士。僅數百耳。卒以扼險死守。至數月之久。能以少勝多。殲敵人於域外。不遺一卒。至今德摩比勒之役。榮名震於列强。雖泰西三尺之童。靡不知之。而崇拜之。區區半島之希臘。而有義不辱國之士。則以生爲無國之民。何如死爲疆塲之鬼。雖敗猶榮也。否則。爲奴隸之戮。且酷於斧𨨅。試問其能忍乎。</p>
<p>即以近世言之。吾國康熙二十四年稚克薩之役。彭春以萬八千之兵。陷俄人於重圍。直搗其堅壘。至片石無存。且擒其驍將托爾布泰。而終斃之。卒使俄帝俾得之聲威。墜於極地。而尼布楚條約。遂逐俄人於外興安嶺以北。不克南逾一步。此非吾國當時彭春一戰之力乎。然則强弱之形雖殊。而勝負之數。固未可逆睹。安見柔和而遵公理者之必受人凌侮。與殘暴無人道者之可逞志於我。而無敵於世界哉。噫。吾國民可以興矣。</p>
<h3>世界小事記</h3>

<h3>飲乳淺識</h3>
<p>— 心佛</p>
<p>牛乳在今日新家庭中。已爲唯一之食料斯亦西風東漸之一端。惟乳之種類殊夥。如蒸乳、煉乳、乳粉、鮮乳、應用互殊。品質各異。爰就所得。論述於後。聊供主婦之參考耳。</p>
<p>（一）蒸乳製自二加侖鮮乳經蒸發機消散乳中一加侖之水分之比例而成。養分充份保存。消毒完備。菌類絕跡。故能保藏罐中歷數年之久而完好如新。此足爲純潔之鐡證開罐以後。置空氣中。雖在夏季。自晨垂暮亦不酸腐。有時賓客不速而至。餉客需用牛奶者。食物鋪中隨處出售。多寡任意。當蒸發時。用極大之集中力Concentration消毒。一經注入食品。如冰淇淋咖啡之類。發生一種香味。足以增人食慾。此種香味爲鮮乳乳粉煉乳所不具者。其價格以質而論。實較鮮奶爲廉。總之蒸乳爲乳中最完美者。但吾國普通家庭中。尙未習用。此由於未悉其底藴耳。惜蒸乳盡屬外貨。漏巵頗巨。深願吾國企業家起而仿造之。</p>
<p>（二）煉乳十分之六爲乳質。十分之四爲麥糖。嬰孩嗜其甜味。益以胃弱。飲之頗宜。</p>
<p>（二）乳粉用鮮乳加熱至一百四十五度。然後用大壓力或熱軋狀法排去雜質而導入蒸溜室。噴作霧狀。由暖室中吸去水分而成。佳者入水溶化。毫無沉澱。面起薄膜。氣味濃香。携帶輕便。宜於行旅飼嬰。養分富於鮮鮮百分之三十五强。</p>
<p>（四）鮮乳八分之七爲水分。八分之一爲滋養料。胃弱者飲鮮乳爲宜。</p>
<h3>救國賑災口琴音樂會</h3>
<p>— 墨逸</p>
<p>中華口琴會前晚假座北京大戲院。舉行一週紀念大會。收入票資。以百分之八十助賑。百分之二十作救國基金。滬上慈善而愛國的士女們。不到八點鐘。便把整個的北京大戲院坐得滿滿了。</p>
<p>開幕時。全體合奏黨歌。由王慶勳先生指導。我們聽了不覺對於爲人民謀福利。捍衛國家的黨員們從内心裡發出萬分的敬意。奏畢由林康侯先生致開幕詞。他說「要救國先要救人。因爲多救一人。便給國家多留一分實力。這次中華口琴會之所以舉行一週紀念會。便是這個宗旨。」這眞是慨乎言之了。</p>
<p>災民被救。實力充足了。就得鼓勵人民去從軍。爲國家出力。把在東三省横行的日軍趕出國土。於是一曲從軍歌。便在王慶勳先生指導之下。傳入我們的耳鼓了。繼而是王曉籟先生演說。他用紹興官話。說出令人感動的演詞。他主張「人們應該有正當的娛樂。不應該把實貴的金錢和精神用在（昨晚一副三百和没有和下來）的不正當的娛樂上。有了正當的娛樂。便能把人民弄得强起來。當然不會有哭的時候笑和笑的時候哭的事。因此國家也强盛了。」在這短短的演詞中。已經把我們中國人的劣根性暴露無遺了。</p>
<p>暴日這次對我不宣而戰。除了人民轟轟烈烈的表示了幾次以外。我國當局只有鎭靜。不抵抗。向國聯哭訴。這眞是一個抹不去的奇恥大辱。幸而有黑龍江的馬占山將軍。以軍器窳敗而在東三省算爲最懦弱的軍隊。和日軍抵抗。把驕傲而有犀利軍械的日軍擊得大敗而逃。才算給我們中國吐了一口氣。並且表示我們中國不全是只倚賴外人而抱不抵抗主義的。也還有些勇氣冲天的軍人。敢和兇悍的日軍週旋於戰塲上。王慶勳先生爲敬佩馬將軍。便把Suppe作的Ligat　Cavaery一曲改名爲「黑馬奮蹄」。奏到低音時。有如含枚疾走。使我們想到馬將軍的騎兵在黑夜裡去襲擊日軍那一幕緊張神情。高音時。有如山崩地裂。使我們想到屯墾軍的迫擊砲在掩護步隊向日軍衝鋒時那一種雄壯的喊殺聲。觀衆都不覺精神爲之一壯。奏畢。由王慶勳先生臨時提議。請在座的觀衆都慷慨解囊。不論銅元角子都隨便。以所得之欵去援助馬占山將軍。當塲募得大洋一百九十四元三角。小洋二百十角。銅元六十六枚。交給王曉籟先生匯黑。由此可知人心未死。中國前途大有希望。於是東方曲「運命」起奏。表示中國將來的運命甚佳。誠如拿翁所說。「睡獅一旦醒來。便能震撼全球了。」</p>
<p>同時並舉行全滬口琴錦標最後决賽。結果女子組第一是趙濡漌女士。男子組第一是曾克明君。接着便是喻宜萱女士的獨唱。戴粹倫君的提琴獨奏。都異常悅耳。然後是潘仰堯先生的演說。他說「我聽口琴隊所奏的聲音。有的彷彿是黑龍江省的雄壯殺敵聲。有的彷彿是在暴日鐡蹄下的同胞宛轉呻吟。有的彷彿是熱血民衆的悲壯呼聲。有的彷彿是災民啼飢號寒的慘聲。」這幾句話眞沈痛已極。把民國二十年整個中國的遭遇。全給表現出來了。</p>
<p>最後是凱旋進行曲。祝觀衆事業順利。祝馬占山將軍勝利。祝中國和平統一。祝該會前途無疆。觀衆便頓時鼓掌。好像一切的一切已經到了想像的地步。而大會也在這熱烈慶祝凱旋聲中閉幕了。</p>
<p>短訊四馬路卿雲書局。最近出版一部言情小說。名「怨鳳啼凰」。係名作家鍾吉宇所著。内容絕佳。全書以友愛。熱戀。犧牲。眞情爲要點。描寫情塲風味。非常透澈。結構佈局。深刻入微。情節之曲折。事實之離奇。堪與啼笑因緣並駕齊驅。甜酸苦辣。忽悲忽喜。殊能感人。他日苟能攝成影片。定可轟動社會。爲電影界生色不少云。</p>
<p>說部扶輪會</p>
<h3>鄕下人又到上海（十九）</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>我勸你們兩家併成一家，開銷也可以省點，店也可以擴大點，我們買東西的也覺得一致點。」鄕下人很誠懇的貢獻他的意見。</p>
<p>那夥計想：這干他甚事，要他如此發急。便道：</p>
<p>「這是他們東家的事，我們當夥計的，管不到這些事。」他意思是說我們夥計尙不能管，關係鄕下老頭兒什麽事？</p>
<p>「做夥計的自然都帮着東家咧。譬如他們相打，連你們了也打得頭破血淋，你們到底爲了些什麽事？你們夥計和夥計是没有什麽仇怨呀。他們爲了搶生意，因此蝕本，兩方面都發不出薪水，你們夥計不倒霉嗎？甚而至於關店，你們也有歇生意的恐慌咧。我勸你們還是大家看老祖宗面上，互相讓步點吧。」鄕下人居然以第三者的資格，來做一個和事老了。</p>
<p>「就使要合併，也要敎他們併到我們這裏來，因爲我們是大房，在統系上說起來，我們是正統。」那個夥計站在店堂裏，還是侃侃而談。</p>
<p>「阿呀！手背也是肉，手心也是肉，旣然一家人，也不用搭什麽豆腐架子了。大家合併起來就是咯，也不用爭你先我後了。」鄕下人又嚕哩嚕囌，說個不休。</p>
<p>正在這個當兒，他們的東家回來了。</p>
<p>「你們在吵什麽事？」</p>
<p>「這個鄕下人，敎我們兩家合併起來，在這裏刺刺不休。」</p>
<p>「不要理他！」那個東家，瞅了鄕下人一眼。</p>
<p>鄕下人覺得没有了下塲勢。忽然想起：不是電車上的賣票人，說大舞臺對過，還有我的照片嗎？我本是來尋我的照片的，憑空因爲見他們兩家文魁齋，有對峙之勢，所以來勸勸他們，勸得醒，自然最好，勸不醒，只索罷了。我倒還要尋尋我的照片，果然是在這裏不在？</p>
<p>鄕下人東張西望了半天，照片却不曾尋着，猛抬頭却見他們的招牌上，畫著一雙大烏龜。</p>
<p>「咦！我的照片倒没有，只有一雙大烏龜。」他自己念了一遍，不覺有些覺悟起來。便道：「啐！上了這個促狹短命鬼的當了。他尋他老子的開心了。什麽有我的照片，原來是一隻大烏龜。」</p>

<h3>銀根重緊之由來</h3>
<p>證券頻跌…金融界影響匪淺</p>
<p>拆票交易…不得不加以審愼</p>
<p>銀拆直上…勢厚者亦難救濟</p>
<p>市場概况近數日中、金融界有少數因受證券慘跌之影響、虧折至巨、對於營業上難免受莫大打擊、結果停頓或擱淺者大有人在、而市塲中拆票不得不出諸審愼、以致銀根頓時吃緊、銀拆扶搖直上、即勢力雄厚者亦無能爲力、予以救濟、使市面成爲緊張之現象矣、</p>
<p>厘拆價格「洋厘」早市爲七錢二分五厘二毫半、較前日早市頓高一厘二毫半、午市又復提高、計爲七錢二分五厘三毫七忽半、交易形勢亦佳、「銀拆」早市四錢三分、午市四錢五分、較前日市價頓時狂抬一錢、且劃頭加水亦漲至四錢五六分、甚至最高到過五錢以外、銀行掛牌一錢七分、</p>
<p>輔幣市情江南小洋早市爲六錢五分二厘、午市爲六錢五分二厘半、較前日略昻半厘、交易早市四千角、午市六千五百角、廣東小洋早市爲六錢五分、午市爲六錢五分零六毫二忽半、交易早市二十四萬角、午市七萬五千角、銅元仍爲三百八十千文、</p>
<p>銀洋進出　「銀拆」昨日銀行略有收欵、故銀根較緊、收解亦繁、華商收解票欵三百三四十萬、外商收解票欵三百二十餘萬、特欵收解三四百萬、電滙欵五六十萬、押欵催贖二百萬左右、各種貨滙稅什諸欵收解一千零五六十萬、進倉一百七十萬、錢莊銀公單收解五千一百餘萬、劃頭欵收解四百八十餘萬、各路滙欵收解八十餘萬、解現一百餘萬、「洋欵」匯劃票欵早市做出一百五十八萬五千、午市做出一百二十七萬五千、鈔票早市十一萬、午市三萬五千、塲外鈔票早市十三萬五千、午市十七萬、銀行交易早市互市八十萬、午市互市九十萬、各銀行洋户往來收解一百六十餘萬、鈔票進出二百七八十萬、錢莊洋公單收解六百二十餘萬、洋劃頭欵收解一百八十餘萬、拆借洋欵進出一百九十餘萬、小錢莊進出鈔票滙頭六七十萬、客路去胃三十餘萬、</p>
<h3>證券債市仍清價益低疲</h3>
<p>人心續觀望趨勢仍平和</p>
<p>昨（十六日）華商證券交易所各債券市况、現貨交易全日僅七千元、期市亦續鮮生氣、前後市賣買兩方人氣、依然非常沉靜、其閑散情况、與上週末同、計上午成交四百八十餘萬、後市二百十萬元、合計六百九十餘萬元、至言各債價之變動情形、亦見頗屬穏定、全日盤旋無大漲落、蓋爲國聯會雖定昨日重開、其前途猶殊黑暗、目下之嚴重局勢、能否藉會議而有轉機、未易測知、一般人心、觀望如前、大户進出仍稀故也、惟以日來國際間情况、對我漸呈不利、列强一部份譽論顯見袒日助惡、而日在我東省、陰謀獨立、進行益力、增兵備戰、攻掠擾亂、不稍顧忌、市上人心、遂頗虚弱、各方零星售出、殊見踴躍、致各債券市價乃較前繼續下跌、一致傾疲、内如整六裁兵二○捲等本月期貨均跌一元數角、其他亦各小六七角左右、惟關稅九六期貨及編遣裁兵下月期貨僅小二三角、觀債市之形勢、現貨仍極沉悶、將視對外局勢之發展以爲轉移云、</p>

<p>寗漢兩帮多頭購進加碼</p>
<p>現貨不充近期多方拉緊</p>
<p>棉市情勢尙緊、因漢帮寗帮多頭購進加碼、市盤遂帶堅、然海外美印兩棉狀况十分疲弱、趨勢仍向下游、投機者仍抛賣不絶、美棉又做開九千件、價格甚廉、本棉之能堅漲、因現貨缺乏、本月份交解者甚少、多頭拉緊不放、市面平定、然照大勢論之、難以看漲也、</p>

<h3>印英棉業週訊</h3>
<p>孟買上週因國外市場預測良好、銀價上漲、及印棉收成不佳、趨勢堅穏、美棉政府報告雖利賣方、然因日商購進、美棉堅定、結果反漲、其後市况、因賣户缺乏、始終挺秀、現貨方面、頗能維持、存底不厚、新棉來源、因天雨受阻、預料年前之現貨情形、將難寬鬆、輸往歐洲及中國之需要、週内非常活動、附録上週計如下、（單位千包）</p>

<h3>糧食河下米市天晴轉鬆</h3>
<p>南頭昨日各帮來船仍有三十餘艘、而浦存漸濃、城鄕店舖雖越賬期、依然不振、實緣銀根壓迫、成交與昨相仿、厚新粳行情復修角外、早薄二稻貨色稍有銷塲本街復呆、寗胃亦細、價又削二角、變陰元及洋杜尖到積不弱、交易清懈、價疲角餘、</p>
<p>新閘昨日西路來貨三十八九號、河積豐厚、市銷寂寞、人心平淡、西新頂貨跌落一角、中關貨亦短二角、後步尙難站定、窰種早稻晨間交易極少、到頭雖缺、價軟角半、陰變二元酒作坊需要尙殷、開盤有一角之上落、洋杜尖胃口寥寥、下游之象、</p>
<h3>現洋米本街去胃尙佳</h3>
<p>昨日洋米市况、初呈疲勢、後以本街進胃仍佳、市面依然站住、交易反比上週活潑、計開出現小絞二千五百包、價十元二角、十元零一角半、次至十元、一號西貢三百包、價十一元五角七分、敏黨二百包、價十元零七角七分、期貨洋行續抛、市形仍軟、昨日又由本街購進新交易五百噸、四月份小絞、價仍四兩九錢云、</p>
<h3>標粉晨落午回</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市面、又見巨大之落勢、以洋麥報價、仍小六七角、而金市亦搖搖不定、故人心異常不安、本月份初開低至一兩九錢二分半、十二月份至一兩九錢四分半、一月份至一兩九錢七分、二月份至一兩九錢七厘半、三月份至二兩零一分七厘半、四月份至二兩零二分半、較前週收盤、又跌一二分不等、惟以後各盤、因浮空怠事抵補、南北洋之客銷帮、無近論遠、均有吸進、大致認此種市值、已覺低廉、故紛紛暢進也、迨至下午開盤、以客帮仍有進胃、市氣仍見騰貴、聞天津各埠、因將封河、存底又枯、致進意濃厚、人心遂力見堅挺也、結果本月份及十二月份、反較前週回漲一分七厘半、一月份漲二分七厘半、二月份漲二分半、三月份漲二分七厘半、四月份漲三分云、</p>
<h3>期麥疲而復穏</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上下午開盤後　各月份市面、呈初疲繼穏之象、以因洋麥報價仍落六七角、（傳聞國外麥價之重落、因得甘霖、麥産仍可豐收）且匯率之不能重縮、所以大部分人心、終見虚軟、後因空方暢補、并因粉市之回振、人心又趨激昻、惟最後復傳西部洋麥可有定成、合價祇三兩九錢、照此情形、似乎廠家又在活動之中、故粉之環境雖轉好、麥則反重見問題也、結果本月份反好二分、十二月份好二分、一月份不動、二三四月份好二分、</p>

<h3>日清籌辦結束</h3>
<p>從此長江無日船</p>
<p>此次抵制日貨、全國一致、實施以來、滬地日商、已陷入無法維持之境、而在華日輪、受創尤甚、本埠日清輪社、自受抵制以後、已無貨客、兩個餘月、可稱絕無營業、在各船全開時、每月開支須三十萬元、上月該社已停航輪船三分之二、今以抗日風潮、愈趨愈烈、營業前途、絕無希望、該社連日會議、以今次抵制風潮、恐非一二年内所可平息、各船常此空航、則暗虧殊無底止、遂由該社議定、將在華航業、辦理結束、記者昨遇該社負責人員、叩以狀况、承告準備收束狀况頗詳、兹記其概况如下、</p>
<p>已停船舶該社以揚子江輪業爲主、在上下游均有船舶行駛、每年營業、約在在百至四百萬元左右、自抵制事起、在上月中旬、已先將滬宜班宜渝班各輪停班、繼又將長江輪減去四船、祇留四輪行駛、上游已無輪行、即滬漢一路、亦無生意、留行之船、多走空班、</p>
<p>日人回國該社自上海起、若鎭江·南京·蕪湖·九江·漢口·宜昌·沙市·重慶·長沙·等埠、均有碼頭躉船棧房及分社、自本月分起、雇用日本職員、已全體辭退、並令挈眷歸國、碼頭躉船棧房分社、凡在漢口之上者、陸續封閉、邇日又將上海總社内各部份日人職員、一律解雇、資遣歸國、唯社長尚留滬埠、</p>
<p>海輪停業該社自上月起、中國水陸職工、已經解雇者、業有二千名以上、邇日迭開會議、以本社營業、向以裝日貨爲主、今已完全停運、南北洋五輪、自天津事起、營業更覺慘落、故已先將巴陵丸滬津專航班撤廢、其嵩山·廬山·華山·唐山·等船、昨據該社負責人員言、已經决定、在數日内、亦將停航不開、</p>
<p>辦理結束華經理部份、早辦收束、故該社全部營業、事實上早已十停七八、上海社長電致東京總社、討論善後辦法、兹聞業經總社决定、令滬社速辦收束辦法、以便減少損失、南北洋停航、今日會議、大致可以取决、輟班後、津汕厦粤青各埠分社碼棧、亦封閉解散、最後將留行長江四輪停行、爲全部業務之總收束、刻已着手進行中、</p>
<p>江輪失事該社長江船瑞陽丸、今次由滬赴漢、行至通州上流、適遇大霧、當時因航路蔽没、不能行駛、欲待抛泊、而已誤入淺灘、船身擱在暗礁、輪體不能行動、遂在發急電多通求救、該社除派襄陽丸駛往救護、並駁載貨客、先往漢口外、昨又加調小火輪柏號、飛往拖救、</p>

<h3>郵務工會所得日人拘長春郵務長訊</h3>
<p>哈瑟均抗議檢查郵件被囚禁兩日備受屈辱</p>
<p>上海郵務工會、昨日接得吉黑郵務職工會爲長春郵局署副郵務長哈瑟均因抗議檢杳郵件、慘遭日軍拘禁、開釋到哈治病經過、敬告上海郵界同人禦外書云、此次東北事變、本區内吉林長春等處、自被日軍强佔之後、據我官署、奪我政權、殺我人民、燬我居室、其横暴恣肆、窮兇極惡、令人痛心切齒、各該處郵局、雖幸未被占領、但處其淫威之下、已完全失却自由、而凌虐我員工情事、亦已數見不鮮、就中尤以拘禁長春局署副郵務長哈瑟均一案、爲最嚴酷、兹特將其經過情形、分述如次、</p>
<p>入獄經過　緣駐長春日本憲兵司令部於本年十月初間、强執派員在長春檢查郵件、經該局呈報之後、於十月二十三日奉令提出抗議、該局哈局長固知當地我國機關、已不能行使職權、而日軍氣燄正盛、經抗議、難免受其茶毒、然以職責所在、國權攸關、以爲縱有危險、豈能畏縮、遂毅然以抗議書遞交該部、翌晨、果接該部電話傳訊、哈局長當即前往、該日本憲兵司令氣態倣慢、怒形於色、厲聲謂汝竟提出抗議、公然反日、罪無可逭、竟不容辯解、立命憲兵二名、將哈局長架上汽車、押送監獄、途中憲兵分立左右、如解重囚、路人見者、相與驚懼、旣抵監獄、褫去外衣、曳入斗室、時雪後天氣驟寒、室内窗户洞開、朔風砭骨、哈局長以衣衫單薄、戰慄幾不自持、且自入獄以後、飲食斷絕、其凍餒之苦、夫豈能堪、當時哈局長自念以爲三五日間、如不能出獄、殆恐難保殘生、其情形之凄慘、令人言之酸鼻、</p>
<p>開釋情形初哈局長被拘之後、該局同人、立即報告當地中國官長、懇爲援救、乃彼輩以在日軍監視之下、畏葸不敢出面、且謂對於此案、日軍正在集議、即使出面、亦恐無濟於事、當時情勢之嚴重、概可想見、嗣經該局報請濱江管理局派員到長、託由日本郵便局長代爲緩頰、始於二十五日晚九時半、將哈局長開釋、計囚禁兩日、備受屈辱、且於臨出司令部之前、該憲兵司令嚴加警告、謂此次姑予寬免、倘使再犯、定必嚴重處理等語、蓋其居心叵測、尙欲尋釁報復、已屬昭然若揭也、</p>
<p>到哈治病哈局長此番被難、精神上損失極重、自出獄以來、食不下咽、寢不安枕、心氣異常衰弱、於十一月四日奉令來哈、面陳經過後、已先請病假一個月、延醫調治、脫非靜心攝養、恐短期間内難望痊可、敝會同人等以哈同志於環境顚危之下、不顧個身利害、擬然向日軍提出抗議、爲此次東省事變中有聲有色之一幕、其偉大之人格與犧牲之精神、實有砭鍼末俗、喚起人心之價值樹厥風聲、資人崇敬、</p>
<p>協力禦侮而悍賊恃勢憑陵、侵略我國土、蹂躪我人民、此種大辱奇恥、尤爲吾人永世所不能忘、用特舉陳事實、奉告遐邇、所望我全國郵界同志、念國難之方殷、外侮益逼、人人抱切實衛國之心、人人鼓拚命殺敵之勇、以挽危亡、以雪國恥、庶哈同志個人、雖因公受辱、而舉國同志、感其忠烈、互相激勵、能於救國工作上、多增力量、則已有相當之代價、惟同人所不安者、以哈同志所病非輕、時未能康復、而現在長春地方、仍在日軍盤據之中、彼輩殘暴性成、罔識信義、旣與哈同志嫌怨已深、難免不藉辭别生枝節、如於此時回局服務、不獨病體所不許、且前途危險、實在在堪虞、亟應留哈長期靜養、免生意外、至哈同志、忠於職守、不惧艱危公家應如何從重獎叙、以勵公忠、應如何特加體恤、以策安全、則酬庸懋賚、例有常經、郵政當局、必能優爲之計也、除於哈同志來哈後、已由本會開會慰問、並隨時勸其調養、以期早復健康外、特此馳聞、敬希公鑒、吉黑郵務職工會、十一月六日、</p>

<h3>日文報之謬論</h3>
<p>國人抵貨應努力到底勿再蹈五分鐘之譏笑</p>
<p>上海日日新聞前日發表一文預測「經濟絕交之崩壞」誣衊排貨爲「飽其私囊、」原文云、此次抗日救國運動之經濟絕交與從來不同、不許依救國基金之制度、販賣日貨、因此該會之收入頗少、委員等不得照其預期而飽其私囊、繼而紗廠工人碼頭工人之强制罷工、不能計劃、至於最近絕對的經濟絕交、亦漸有動搖之徵象、即抗日會於十三日對於左列條件在中國報上發表救國基金之納付方法、以該商品輸入於該地之期日爲差等、七月十四日以前者照價格一成五分、十五日以後二十四日爲止者二成、十六日以後九月十八日爲止者二成五分、而由九月十九日以後輸入者由抗日會發賣通行證（價格不明）、（譯者按、以上各條、爲經濟絕交會所提議、與抗日會無涉、）商人方面、最高以五分爲限、對於以上之率、似有不應命之意、昨日亦爲此與抗日會交涉、今明日内諒能妥協、以一般中國商人之意氣亦軟化、至於實施前述辦法之程度、所謂經濟絕交、已有逐漸越過最高峯之感云云、</p>

<p>關於其他被告者查民法四五○條第二項明白規定「但有利於承租人之習慣者從其習慣、」按上海租賃房屋習慣、（一）欠租三個月以上、（二）房屋破舊、實有翻造之必要、（翻造後、舊房客仍有優先租賃權、）（三）房主收回自用外、房東不能令房客遷讓、被告等租賃之始、雖未約定期限、然依據上項之習慣、故敢付給鉅額之小租及裝修費、且房屋並不破舊、自毋庸翻造、原告等居心叵測、貿然勒令遷讓、在法律上毫無根寫、應請駁斥原告之訴、</p>
<p>關於假執行部份查本案原被兩造、於租約應否解除之點、旣發生爭執、即屬賃借權涉訟、當然不屬初級管轄之件、（見最高法院對大綸案十九年十一月念八二九八八號判决書）核閱鈞院之傳票上、載明二十年地字四五二號、認爲本案係地方管轄之件、原告等所援用民訴條例四六二條第三欵、係就第二各欵訴訟所爲被告敗訴之判决而言、本案旣不屬初級管轄、更無適用該條欵之餘地、應請駁斥宣示假執行之請求者一、查被告等其中屬於商店者居多、所選貨物價值在百萬以上、均以合於時尙爲標準、但時尙有日新月異之勢、若遽予宣示假執行、則數百萬元之貨、勢必擱置、其價值自不免一落千丈、此種損害、不獨難以計算、抑且陷於萬刦不復之地、應請駁斥者二、被告均有營業關係、放出賬項、遠至内地各埠、若一旦停業、債務人以後永不往來、則所欠貨欵、咸將裹足不前、此種損害、誰負其責、應請駁斥者三、被告等雇用職工、在千人以上、平時胥賴薪工、以資生活、一旦停業、直接使數千職工坐以待斃、間接使數千人之家屬、亦陷於絶境、值此暴日蹂躪東北、水災幾遍全國、滬上市面蕭條、人民方救死之不遑、而原告等亦同胞一份子、何必定欲置經濟弱者於死地、應請駁斥者四、基上理由、被告等合詞籲請鈞院、將原告等之訴及宣示假執行之請求、併予駁斥云云、」</p>
<p>請調查上海習慣昨晨由楊易推事開民十庭傳訊、原告經律師陳明起訴事實後、請迅速進行、以免原告受有損失、泰昌號之律師陳兆祺稱、泰昌係將房屋另行轉租與人、現泰昌對三房客業已起訴云云、而王傳璧等律師則請求調查上海習慣、楊推事遂諭本案改期、候定期傳審、</p>

<p>社會消息</p>
<h3>法將福煦歐戰日記</h3>
<p>— 顧昻若譯</p>
<p>十月初頭兩星期、我軍尙未佔領北萊茵、惟南萊茵已在我軍掌握、十月八日我提出的條件要求佔有萊茵北岸三處橋頭堡、這樣、我軍在和議不成重新開戰的時候便可直攻萊茵中部了、</p>
<p>我的建議同美總統宣布的退兵條件相差甚遠、惟威爾遜總統的最低限度的休戰先决條件、並不是說聯軍認爲必要的其他條件可以不提、因此協約國代表於十月九日午後在巴黎外交部集議的時候我便把條件提出、</p>
<p>克萊孟沙君雖主張不參加柏林華盛頓間的談判、勞合喬治君爲避免以後誤會起見、力勸其他代表通告威爾遜總統、請注意他的條件尙欠詳盡、英首相道、威爾遜總統所提出的條件「不能防止德軍不利用休戰的機會佈置優勢的軍事地方、一俟和議决裂再圖反攻、德軍必乘停戰機會、逃避困境、救出軍實、改編隊伍、縮短防綫、退歸新陣地、徐圖佈防、」</p>
<p>他又說、「軍事專家没有協商和軍事形勢没有研究之前、休戰條件不能决定……」、</p>
<p>勞合喬治君這個主張頗有見地、因德軍野心未死、一定要乘機作死灰復燃之企圖的、</p>
<p>十月十二日、巴敦親王急急忙忙的通告華盛頓政府、「準備根據威爾遜總統的退兵條件訂立休戰條約、」</p>
<p>但其時美總統已接得協約國警告此點的危險、遂改取强昻主張、十月十四日、他電告德首相道、</p>
<p>……休戰條件須取决於美國和協約國政府軍事專家、一切條件、如不能絕對滿意的保障美軍和協約軍現在的優勢、美政府不能接受、</p>
<p>德政府對於白宫提出的新要求决不甘心輕易就範、德政府對於美國突然提出嚴厲條件、必然置之不理、美國旣須柏林政府向協約國軍事當局交涉、自然不能反對、惟德政府希望能使協約政府予以更有利的條件、</p>
<p>十月二十日、德首相答覆美總統道、　　「德政府於接受退出、佔領區域條件之時、主張將退兵辦法和休戰條件取决於軍事顧問、而以前敵兩軍的比例作爲保障休戰條件的基礎、德政府現請總統提出詳細條件、深信美國總統未必提出與德國榮譽和媾成公正和平衡突之要求……」、</p>
<p>巴敦親王的陰謀不能使協約政府入其圈套、惟柏林華盛頓間談判已兩星期、現在必須停止、因其前途徒足引起糾紛、更不能使德人認威爾遜總統爲協約政府和德奥的仲裁人、這種局面只能使協約國有百弊而無一利、所以協約國軍事顧問應即自己出面、</p>
<p>最高軍事評議會在一九一七年成立之後、協約政府當局即有其專家顧問爲軍事代表常駐凡爾賽、四個月之後、聯軍總司令産生、這些顧問遂無足重輕、但於名義上彼等仍不失爲協約政府的普通諮議、彼等便於十月八日根遽這個資格奉命擬就對德休戰計劃、</p>
<p>協約政府固須諮詢其軍事顧問、但亦更須同各軍司令商量、他們對於軍隊狀况和休戰條件知之較詳、他們對於准許休戰以及指揮戰爭均有責任、我便在十月十六日致法總理函中提出這點、</p>

<p>强暴橫蠻的日本、乘着我國天災人禍交迫之時、大舉其凶悍得如狼似虎的軍隊、覇佔我物産豐富的東北、而我當局眼睜睜的讓敵人在那裏任意的殺戮我人民、奸淫我婦女、炸毁我城池、此而可忍、孰不可忍、</p>
<p>我們愛國的民衆、痛恨倭奴的暴戾、傷心國土的淪亡、個個都氣憤塡膺、個個都莫不髮指、遂自動地起來反抗、商人抵貨、工人罷工、學生罷課、並且組織義勇軍爲作戰前驅、組織請願隊晉京請願、要求政府對日宣戰、我們民衆能做的、也總算做到了、雖則我政府鑑於國内團結的未固、匪患的未除、仍在猶豫的、但人民愛國的熱誠、並不因此銷沈、而且更加熱烈起來、</p>
<p>我是中國國民的一份子、現在我以一個小百姓的資格、捧呈赤熱的心、在全國同胞的面前、在這裏我將向全國同胞訴說我在這國難聲中的微弱的、然而是於心無愧的行動、</p>
<p>我是在中日合辦的機關内的一個普通職員、我雖還年青、然而負担却不小、家庭經濟完全靠我一人維持、自從聽見東三省的惡耗傳來後、便終日悶悶不樂、還是辭職呢、抑是吞聲忍氣的在日人的得意的形態之下工作呢、這個問題無時無刻不在我胸中激戰、要是辭職後家庭的生計怎樣呢、否則自己的良心怎樣安定呢、</p>
<p>我終於受不過良心上的譴責、憤憤地辭去眼前的職務了、雖則生活的問題漸漸向我逼迫、使我感覺到無限的痛苦、然而我想念到爲祖國的光榮、而犧牲我個人的幸福、是神聖的、值得的、因此我並不後悔、</p>
<p>當我在職的時候、我時和同事的日本人談到東北事件的問題、我固然爲着懦弱的中國辯護、但他們却也同樣爲着他們侵略的帝國辯護、有時甚至於爭吵起來、這也是當然的事、</p>
<p>但是日本人民之抱着野心的固然是很多、而同時也不乏眞實同情中國的日本青年、這當然是思想清晰的一類、在我同事的日本青年中、便有一個名呌野島的這人、在我辭職的前幾天的一個上午、我和他兩個在化學科的工作室裏坐着、各人皆沉默地看着當日的報紙、這報紙上面用頭號字記載着日軍的野蠻行爲、我正在憤慨得不能自持、想馬上離開那地方、</p>
<p>野島却突然向我說起話來了、</p>
<p>「這次的事變、實在是中日兩國人民的大不幸、」</p>
<p>我祇覺得他是在得意地諷刺我、我幾乎想破口辱駡他一頓、我氣憤地說、</p>
<p>「這完全是强盜行爲、乘我們天災内亂之際、竟舉兵來相犯、還口口聲聲地說什麽中日親善、還說什麽共存共榮、還說什麽同文同種、這簡直是放屁、」</p>
<p>但野島却從容地說、</p>
<p>「不錯、這全都是放屁、這都是日本的軍閥政客資本家大地主所放的屁、但這和我們一般日本小百姓却無關、只要熟悉現社會制度的便都知道、日本出兵侵犯中國的領土、不但中國百姓受着非人道的苦難、即日本的百姓也一樣受着苦難、這話說來太長、而且你也一定會不相信、我且不多說、但我得向你表明、我個人也是和你一樣、痛恨着日本軍閥政客資本家太地主這次的暴行、我完全同情中國、同情你、是的、你這時會以爲我是在欺騙你、在愚弄你吧、」</p>
<p>「你欺騙我也好、愚弄我也好、」我說、「我從此誓不再和你們日本人合作、從此斷絕和你們的關係、」我滿胸氣憤無處發洩、這樣說了的第二天我便離開那個中日合辦的機關了、雖則那個中日合辦的機關現在仍舊是中日合辦、雖則東省事件到了現在仍然毫無樂觀的希望、雖則我現在正受着失業的磨難、然而、我並不後悔、</p>
<h3>老爺敎授</h3>
<p>— 獻魯</p>
<p>提起了老爺敎授、誰還不搖頭、心領着他的懿範、</p>
<p>「法學通論」規定爲必修科、所以雖然有些人不願意讀、然而受着學分威迫和引誘而選的人却也不在少數、</p>
<p>留學法國堂堂巴黎大學的法學博士×老師來上課了、他穿着灰色嗶嘰袍子黑馬褂、脚上拖了、粉底對臉緞子響鞋、面部蓄着八字短鬍、左手夾一本法學通論慢搖二擺地走進敎室、在離講臺還有一丈多遠老早把那本染有粉筆灰的書撲的丢過去、隨後重重的坐進講座、兩雙眼睛向下面望了一望、</p>
<p>「×××」、他用着平生最低微的聲浪喊名字、接着又陡然高起來、另喊着學號「三三四九」、你如果没有注意的話、只當他是點「×××·三三四九」、决不在意他是點着兩個人、</p>
<p>「××美德」、他的聲音更小得幾乎聽不出了、</p>
<p>「怎麽美而且德的女士不到嗎」、他似乎又轉變了滑稽的面孔說、</p>
<p>「到的、先生、我没有聽見」、</p>
<p>「哼、没有聽見……」</p>
<p>一次名點了有二十分鐘、於是他開始講書、</p>
<p>「今天我……來……講……法學、」輕輕的語調似斷未斷的說着、忽而又特别高起來、「什麽是法學呢、」</p>
<p>這樣講着、委實使你無從聽起、大家面對面的示苦、他似乎也明白一切、嚴厲的說、</p>
<p>「你們不聽嗎、這就是我的Lecture、要你們筆記的啊、」</p>
<p>照着這個方式講到下課、全堂能紀全他筆記的人没有幾個、衆人除了呌苦以外、簡直没有什麽法子、在同一語調中可以聽到的、</p>
<p>││老爺敎授、</p>
<p>呵、老爺敎授、嘸伊那能、</p>
<p>這確是很好的消息、×敎授許久没來了、我們眞要喊一聲感謝上帝、爲×老師祝福、多虧他放了我們這些時的生、在他享有數百萬的家産、擁有嬌美妻子什麽「推事」的官也做過、大可不必來敎書、吃這個粉筆灰、閒居享樂、以逍遙於世外、不過有人說、老爺敎授因爲還有點名氣、現在已去當什麽委員、做大老爺去了、</p>

<h3>Fierce Battle on Tangchi Front, Our Army Achieves Great Victory</h3>
<p>Japanese Troops Charge Into Our Lines</p>
<p>Our Troops Emerge from Trenches to Engage</p>
<p>Over Two Hundred Japanese Soldiers Captured</p>
<p>Ceasefire at 3:30 AM Yesterday</p>
<p>(Harbin) The battle between Tangchi and Moguxi is intense. The fighting continued until 2:00 AM on the 15th. A Japanese cavalry unit charged towards our positions at Shuanma and other places, using hand-thrown grenades to destroy horses. Our cavalry, in order to protect the area, emerged from the trenches to engage. Ma Zhanshan's guard regiment led the charge, and the two cavalry regiments of Tu Sha advanced in an encircling maneuver. The enemy troops were caught off guard and routed, and over two hundred were captured and disarmed. At 3:30 AM, the fighting ceased. The Japanese prisoners will be escorted back to Heihe for custody today. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Today at noon, a Japanese aircraft scouted our front lines for ten minutes before being driven off by our artillery fire. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) During the Tangchi battle on the 14th, our wounded regimental commander, Sha Libu, is being transported to Harbin for medical treatment. He was injured in the left leg, but the injury is not severe. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) At 3:00 PM on the 14th, fierce fighting erupted again between Tangchi and Moguxi. Over a thousand Japanese artillery and cavalry troops fiercely attacked our cavalry lines. The area is 25 li from Ang'angxi. The sound of artillery was clearly heard at Ang'angxi station on the night of the 14th. At 1:00 AM on the 15th, fierce fighting was still ongoing in the front, with our troops holding a significant advantage. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) At 2:00 PM on the 14th, four Japanese aircraft dropped six bombs on our infantry lines at Sanjianfang, causing no casualties. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) On the 14th, Major Lin, a representative of the Japanese Kwantung Army Commander, threatened Ma Zhanshan, claiming that they had obtained Russian understanding and could pass through and utilize Yitie when necessary. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Bu Kui telegram: On the 14th, the Japanese army launched a general offensive, using over ten aircraft and a large number of poison gas bombs to fiercely attack our troops' positions north of the Nen River in the area of Huotouqi, Da Xiaoxintun, and Sanjianfang. Bombs rained down, injuring Regimental Commander Sa Libu and many soldiers. Cheng Zhiyuan's brigade completely joined the front lines from Ang'angxi. Ma Zhanshan personally went to supervise the battle. Fierce fighting continued at noon on the 15th. The unexploded bombs dropped by Japanese aircraft all bear the mark "Showa 6th Year" [1931]. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Harbin telegram: According to the White Russian spy Shanov, who was captured at the Manchouli station, Zhang Haipeng is suffering from madness and is completely swollen. His fourth son and several trusted regimental commanders have been killed in action. Zhang is filled with remorse and his illness has worsened. The Japanese army suffered four to five hundred casualties in this offensive. The Japanese troops attacking Heihe consist of six infantry battalions, three artillery battalions, over ten aircraft, and over forty artillery pieces. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Today, the battle in the Nen River Bridge area is raging fiercely, and it is feared that it will escalate into a larger-scale battle. According to Japanese military reports, fierce fighting has been ongoing since dawn until now. Among the Japanese casualties, there is one cavalry officer, four non-commissioned officers, and three artillerymen. The sound of artillery can be heard in various locations between Daya and Ang'angxi. The Japanese Ministry of the Army, due to the outbreak of war along the Tao'ang line, has ordered the immediate dispatch of aircraft squadrons from Hamamatsu in Japan and Pyongyang in Korea to the front lines of the Nen River Bridge, arriving overnight. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) The Japanese demands for the Heihe army to withdraw from Heihe and Ang'angxi, and the Japanese bombardment of the Heihe cavalry yesterday, seem to have aroused suspicion on the part of the Chinese army. Therefore, the Chinese army is currently preparing for the next battle in various locations. At the same time, the Japanese soldiers disrupting the Nen River Bridge end, and the long trench lines south of Ang'angxi, have been quickly improved by the Heihe army to prepare for the expected Japanese invasion. Reconnaissance cavalry is very active. Last night, an assault team crossed the Japanese lines, attacked the Qiandun station, 90 miles south of Ang'angxi, and cut off its communications. By the time Japanese troops arrived to pursue, the route had been destroyed. Repair work is currently underway, but there are fears of similar attacks in the future. The Heihe army near Ang'angxi is currently collecting food and other supplies, showing no sign of accepting the Japanese demands for withdrawal. (16th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Harbin news urgent telegram: It is said that Ma Zhanshan attacked the Japanese army's Daxing position at dawn today. A fierce battle is currently underway. Tokyo has not yet received official reports. (16th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Reinforce Nen River</h3>

The Fourth Plenary Session approved the candidates for various committees (see domestic news). Yugoslavia is borrowing money from France to expand its military (see foreign news). The technical committee of the National Government Disaster Relief Committee held a meeting yesterday. The Qing Company is preparing to close (see local news).</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>The Public's Sentiment of Comforting General Ma</h3>
<p>General Ma Zhanshan, the acting chairman of Heilongjiang Province, leads a lone army in a remote frontier, resisting the violent Japanese like wolves and tigers. An isolated city at sunset, yet his heroic spirit soars to the heavens. He fights arduously, ultimately causing the violent army to retreat in the face of his valor. His telegram to the nation is impassioned and inspiring, worthy of song and praise. He fulfills his duty to defend the territory with unwavering righteousness. "Only in a strong wind does one know the strength of the grass; only in times of upheaval does one recognize a loyal minister." He is truly a good soldier of our nation, a good man of our people. He is truly worthy of being a rallying cry to awaken the national spirit of our ancient country.</p>
<p>In recent days, people's organizations and individuals across the country, to encourage the loyal and brave soldiers of General Ma's army and to provide practical support, have spontaneously donated large sums of money and sent them to Heihe as comfort. Even peddlers and laborers are contributing their hard-earned money enthusiastically. As for letters and telegrams of comfort and encouragement, they are flying in like snowflakes. Public opinion regards General Ma as the military force of the nation, a model for soldiers. Even three-foot-tall children know of Ma Zhanshan, the man who resists the violent Japanese with a lone army.</p>
<p>From this kind of fact and public opinion, we should be able to glimpse the true will of the people, that is, the people's demands and expectations for soldiers: to defend the country, to protect the people, and to defend against the invasion of our nation's enemies. Whoever can fulfill this responsibility is the people's military force, is the one who is wholeheartedly supported by the people.</p>
<p>In recent years, domestic unrest has been incessant. Every time military expenses are raised, the people are distressed and frown, reluctantly bearing the burden in helplessness. This is an undeniable fact. However, for Ma's army, which is resisting the violent Japanese this time, people are donating spontaneously and enthusiastically, as if afraid of being left behind, saving on food and clothing, and giving with utmost sincerity. From this, it can be seen that the people's vision is the clearest, the people's hearing is the sharpest. Under the scrutiny of all eyes, they distinguish right from wrong with the greatest fairness, without any bias. For the people's judgment of right and wrong is based on substantial facts rather than mere verbal propaganda.</p>
<p>Under the lessons of these facts, soldiers of our nation should henceforth recognize their own responsibilities and recognize the mission they should shoulder at present. Any soldier who can truly defend the country, protect the territory, and fulfill his duties, the people will spare no effort, even sacrificing their lives, to be his backing. Today, our nation is at the final line of survival. The people have already made the resolution to sacrifice themselves, to rise up and rush to the front lines, to fight for the sake of justice, righteousness, and the survival of the nation. This is the final opportunity. If one first considers carefully and hesitates, fearing that defeat in the war would lead to national demise, losing heart from the start, and lacking the spirit and determination to prefer shattering like jade rather than surviving like tile, then the nation will surely perish. Therefore, today, all the generals and soldiers of our nation should urgently emulate the loyalty and bravery of General Ma and rise up. All the people have prepared to destroy their homes and bodies, to make the final struggle.</p>
<h3>Receiving Important Domestic News</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Bu Kui telegram: The Japanese army attacking Jiangyan was repelled by our army yesterday. There is currently no fierce fighting. The Japanese army is replenishing its forces and has transferred the 2nd Division from Korea to move towards the Tao'ang line. Japanese Lieutenant General Domon personally arrived at the Nen River to command the battle, but failed to succeed. We have increased troop reinforcements to stabilize the lines. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>All Japanese Residents in Qiqihar Have Left the City</h3>
<p>(Harbin) All Japanese residents in Qiqihar have left the city. Even personnel from the consulate and military attachés have all departed. Consul General Shimizu and Japanese military representative Major Lin, along with eleven consulate personnel, arrived in Harbin yesterday. This is because they believe the war may not end, so they are leaving the provincial capital of Heilongjiang. Consul General Shimizu told people that General Ma Zhanshan's troops are concentrated in the area of Sanjianfang, Daxingtun, and Xiaoxingtun, totaling about 8,000 men, relying on strong fortifications. The fortifications are in a four-row system. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The news that the Japanese consulate in Qiqihar has left the city, which was spread by the Chinese side yesterday, has been confirmed by official sources this afternoon. This is because the situation is becoming increasingly dangerous, so they have no choice but to leave the city. The claim by Soviet Russia that Japan is plotting to seize Qiqihar is firmly denied here. However, if Ma Zhanshan's troops clash with the Japanese army, then there may be warfare around Qiqihar. It is reported that the train leaving Harbin for Manchouli this morning to connect with the Siberian Express was delayed due to the serious situation in Ang'angxi. The tense situation is evident. (16th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Tianjin Rioters Become Active Again Under Japanese Protection</h3>
<p>Attacking the Peace Preservation Corps, Japanese Troops Open Fire to Support Them, Rioters Disperse Only Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>(Beiping) At 10:30 PM on the 15th, a large number of rioters suddenly appeared again near the Methodist Church outside the South Gate, opening fire and starting trouble. Our security police tried their best to resist, but the fighting continued late into the night. At the same time, the Japanese side declared to our authorities that when resisting the rioters, stray bullets must not fly towards the Japanese barracks. In fact, the Methodist Church is only 200 meters away from the Japanese barracks. These rioters deliberately gathered tightly in the area in front of the Japanese barracks and opened fire on us. If the security police retaliated, stray bullets would inevitably hit the Japanese barracks. Therefore, it is extremely difficult for our authorities to deal with the situation. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tianjin telegram: Last night, plainclothes troops opened fire in the area of the Methodist Church, attacking our security police. After holding out for two hours, the plainclothes troops were defeated and scattered in all directions. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) At 10:40 PM on the 15th, the sound of gunfire was deafening. The Peace Preservation Corps reported that over a thousand plainclothes troops launched fierce attacks on our lines from the Haiguang Temple area in several groups. Because they were ordered not to open fire, they requested instructions. Mayor Zhang immediately contacted Kashii by telephone. Soon, a large group of plainclothes troops attacked our defense lines. Kashii replied that he didn't know anything. Zhang said, "In that case, for the sake of maintaining order and self-defense, our Peace Preservation Corps must open fire." Kashii said, "Opening fire is permissible, but bullets must not enter the Japanese barracks or the Japanese concession." Zhang hung up the phone, angered by Kashii's obvious protection of the rioters and his intention to make things difficult for us. He telegraphed an order to fiercely suppress the rioters. At 11:30 PM, the battle was raging fiercely. Japanese troops opened fire in support. Military attachés from Britain, France, and the United States inquired of our side why gunshots and artillery fire were heard again tonight. Our side replied that the situation was unclear and suggested that they go to inspect. The attachés then contacted Kashii, who agreed. By this time it was already 12:00 AM. The attachés did not depart, and the gunfire stopped and the rioters dispersed. In such a situation, who can believe that the Japanese were not secretly assisting them? (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Over a hundred Japanese women and children returned to their country from Tanggu yesterday. Six or seven out of ten Chinese people in the Japanese concession have also fled. The Japanese army has set up machine guns on the upper floors of the Da Lun Lao Jiu Zhang Building. The Japanese warship Asagao sailed up from Tanggu on the morning of the 16th, loaded with a large amount of ammunition, intending to go to Tianjin, but sailed to Gegu due to the shallow water and stopped. Over a hundred marines went ashore to demonstrate, and returned to Tanggu at noon. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tianjin telegram: The Japanese preparation funds for the Tianjin Incident were originally set at six million, but only one million six hundred thousand has been used so far. The plainclothes troops are hired by the Japanese on a monthly basis, with a monthly salary of thirty yuan. During the riot, they received six yuan per day. Before the riot, a large quantity of flour was purchased and stored for use. It is rumored that Zhang Bi and Li Jichun are still hiding in Tianjin. During the riot last night, our Peace Preservation Corps suffered one death and over ten injuries. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Many in Tianjin's Labor Community Are Destitute Due to Martial Law</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Due to martial law, up to 300,000 people in the labor community have been unemployed and destitute for a week. The relief association is prioritizing assistance to women and children. Assistance to laborers will have to wait for a week. Currently, the people are restless and the situation is serious again. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Wang Shuchang Admits Humiliating Conditions and Apologizes to the Japanese Authorities at Japanese Barracks</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Wang Shuchang went to the Japanese barracks on the afternoon of the 15th to negotiate with Kashii. He was forced to accept the following conditions by 8:30 PM: (1) The Chinese authorities apologize to the Japanese authorities for the Chinese Peace Preservation Corps pointing guns at the Japanese concession within 300 meters on the 14th. (2) Suppress propaganda that is detrimental to Japan's reputation. (3) Remove defensive fortifications within 300 meters. The Peace Preservation Corps is not allowed to enter this area. Chinese police are allowed to serve with handguns. Wang returned to his residence at 9:00 PM. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Japanese Commander Kashii invited Chairman Wang to the Japanese barracks for a meeting. Wang went at 1:00 PM and returned at 8:30 PM. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) When Wang Shuchang went to the Japanese barracks to meet with Kashii on the 15th, Japanese soldiers surrounded the area in full gear. They talked from 5:00 PM to 7:30 PM without result. Japanese soldiers fired machine guns at Haiguang Temple, provoking our Peace Preservation Corps on one hand and threatening Chairman Wang on the other. Wang remained calm and ordered his attendants to strictly telegraph the Peace Preservation Corps not to return fire. When Wang left the Japanese barracks at 9:00 PM on the 15th, Japanese soldiers used machine guns to force Wang to take pictures to commemorate the humiliation of China. Wang sternly refused. The Japanese newspapers reported on the 16th that Wang Shuchang showed no fear during the great gunfire last night. Many people praised Wang, believing that last night was the grand finale of the Tianjin Incident. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tianjin telegram: On the 15th, Wang Shuchang met with the commander of the Japanese army stationed in Tianjin to discuss the aftermath of the Tianjin Incident. The meeting was quite pleasant. It was decided that detailed discussions on everything would be held on the 16th. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Japanese dispatch: Wang Shuchang visited Japanese Army Commander Kashii last night and talked for three hours. As a result, both sides agreed to simultaneously withdraw defensive positions in the buffer zone. Documents will be exchanged by the Chinese and Japanese authorities. It is heard that the official documents will be announced today. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yesterday afternoon, Wang Shuchang and the commander of the Japanese defense forces in the Tianjin Japanese Concession agreed on a method of reconciliation. Afterwards, Wang visited the Japanese Consul General and expressed his regret for the several conflicts between the Chinese police and plainclothes rioters last week that affected the Japanese concession. At 9:30 PM last night, Wang verbally informed the Japanese authorities that he was willing to have the troops withdraw 20 li from Tianjin in accordance with the Boxer Protocol, as requested by the Japanese side, and promised to formally sign the agreement today. The barbed wire and trenches built by the Chinese army near the Japanese concession will also be dismantled. The Chinese army within the Chinese boundary must also withdraw. Armed police from the Chinese Public Security Bureau are not allowed to enter the 300-meter area between the Chinese boundary and the Japanese concession. Only plainclothes police will maintain order there. With the agreement reached, there will be no further conflicts between China and Japan. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Hebei Chairman Wang Shuchang and the commander of the Japanese army in Tianjin talked for four hours yesterday, discussing preliminary measures to restore normalcy, remove obstacles, and withdraw armed Peace Preservation Corps to the Chinese territory. Another meeting will be held today. According to police reports, several plainclothes troops were discovered again in the neutral zone at midnight, but no disturbances occurred. (16th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tianjin telegram: Japanese Consul Sangshima met with Zhang Xueming on the evening of the 15th. It is heard that as a result of the negotiations, a concrete solution was obtained and can be implemented today. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The restriction on the movement of people within the Chinese territory was relaxed today, and many people flocked to the concessions, carrying packages, supporting the elderly and the weak, heading towards the former Austrian Concession. Those entering foreign concessions are endless. The Chinese government does not allow the removal of furniture and utensils, so those who are relocating can only bring their clothes and food necessities. Chinese employees of foreign companies living in the city dared not go out for a week and only resumed work today. (16th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Chinese and Japanese authorities held a meeting at the Japanese consulate this afternoon. According to the Chinese side, the Chinese agreed to dismantle the obstacles and other defenses directly opposite the major streets of the Japanese concession tomorrow, but requested that the Japanese side also remove their defenses at the same time. The Japanese authorities refused, but agreed to remove their defenses after the Chinese side had completely dismantled all the obstacles. It is heard that the Chinese authorities have approved this agreement, but attached a reservation that the obstacles in front of the telephone bureau and the Public Security Bureau will not be dismantled for the time being. This reservation will probably be discussed at a follow-up meeting tomorrow.</p>

<h3>Puyi's Enthronement Postponed, Japanese Fear It Will Provoke League of Nations' Opposition</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Xinmin telegram: Puyi's usurpation of the throne was postponed because Japanese military personnel had differing opinions and the renovation of the Forbidden City was not completed. It was not until late on the 14th that it was decided to postpone the ceremony by three days. The opinions of various Chinese and Japanese people in the area are different. Yuan Jinkai and others advocate careful consideration before ascending the throne again. Kan Chao Xi, Zhao Xinbo, and others are running around seeking positions, fearing they might be left behind, and advocate ascending the throne immediately. Honjo said that the League of Nations meeting on the 16th had nothing to do with the restoration and advocated a deliberate arrangement before making an appearance. The Doihara faction, eager to take credit, advocated enthronement immediately. Japanese diplomats have a more far-sighted view, saying that the enthronement on the 15th would inevitably provoke opposition at the League of Nations meeting on the 16th. This view prevailed, so it was decided to postpone the ceremony. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) On the morning of the 15th in Shenyang, all agencies and shops were notified by the Japanese military police headquarters to hang the newly issued flags in advance, bearing the words "Celebrating the Return of Political Power." The flag is red, blue, and white in vertical stripes, which is the Japanese forcibly expressing the people's will and welcoming Puyi's usurpation of the throne. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese military police and police around Puyi's residence are heavily guarded and have not been withdrawn. Recently, because the telephone lines between the Japanese concession and the outside world are cut off, people have been sent from the residence to the former Prince Chun, Zaiyi, and the residences of various former officials in the British concession to convey that Puyi is safe at home, which is probably a deliberate attempt to cover up the truth. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Xinmin telegram: An American journalist visited Puyi at his Shenyang residence. Puyi came out to meet him, accompanied by a Japanese general from Dalian who acted as an interpreter for consultations before answering. The Japanese man said that Puyi did not participate in Puyi's restoration and that how the political system will be in the future has not been determined today. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Japanese Consul General Lin told everyone that the Japanese consulate had never been involved in Puyi's actions and that the Japanese consulate could not prevent Japanese people from running around and planning for Prince Gong. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Where did Puyi go? Doubts deepen. A Chinese news agency that claimed yesterday that Puyi was enthroned in Shenyang now says that the enthronement ceremony has been delayed by two or three days and that Puyi has not yet arrived in Shenyang. From this, it can be seen that no one knows where Puyi is. (16th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Xinmin telegram: Reasons for Puyi's delayed enthronement: (1) It is heard that Puyi and Puwei are competing fiercely for the throne, which is not easy to resolve. The Shenyang traitors are clearly divided into two factions, one supporting Puyi and one supporting Puwei. Puwei's meeting with foreign journalists without expressing his opinion is due to this. Consul General Lin declared there was no significance to it. (2) Foreign sources say that Puyi's enthronement was delayed because he personally strongly opposed the restoration, and it is heard that Puyi had a suicide threat. It is heard that Tokyo sent instructions to Honjo, saying that Puyi's enthronement at this time, which happened to be the day before the League of Nations meeting, might provoke international opposition, and ordered him to handle the matter carefully. Therefore, it was decided to postpone it. (3) Puyi refused to ascend the throne and threatened suicide, so the ceremony was temporarily postponed for three days to allow for room for negotiation. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) On the morning of the 15th, ten Japanese military policemen and self-defense police officers notified all shops to hang the new tricolor flag, and then issued the Yellow Dragon flag again for them to hang. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Tense Atmosphere: China League Reopened Yesterday. Briand Delivered an Opening Speech Recounting the Mediation Process</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Administrative Council's public meeting reopened amidst tense atmosphere at 4:06 PM. Briand delivered an opening speech and adjourned the meeting at 4:27 PM. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The clock room of the French Foreign Ministry, magnificent and splendid, stands in stark contrast to the simplicity of the Geneva conference room. Before 4 PM, it was already packed. The first representative to arrive was Viscount Cecil, followed by the League of Nations secretaries. Before the meeting, Sir Simon and François-Poncet had a brief conversation. At 4:06 PM, Briand, looking tired, stood up and delivered a speech lasting ten minutes. He coughed several times, appearing very distressed, which caused great concern. The seating arrangement was horseshoe-shaped. Shi Zhaoji sat on the far right, Simon sat in the center, François-Poncet was on his left, and League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond was on his right. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The League of Nations Council, reopened today, held its first meeting at 4:07 PM. Representatives' cars, along with their secretaries carrying maps, arrived in succession at the French Foreign Ministry as the red sun was setting. The first to arrive was the Japanese Ambassador to the UK, Matsudaira, at 3:30 PM. He was followed by Japanese representative François-Poncet, then Spanish Foreign Minister Lerroux, British representative Lord Cecil, and Chinese Chief Representative Shi, all smiling. They were photographed and filmed for newsreels as they entered the ornately decorated conference room and took their seats at 3:45 PM. By then, the conference room was filled with journalists and observers from various countries. The seats of the Japanese representatives, including François-Poncet, were directly opposite those of the Chinese representatives, including Shi. French Foreign Minister Briand, as chairman, stood up to deliver the opening address, first thanking the League of Nations Secretariat staff for coming to Paris from Geneva, then stating that the representatives, meeting in this room today, should remember the founding of the League of Nations and uphold its responsibilities. It is worth noting that this conference room was where French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau passed the League of Nations Charter in 1919. The time difference between Paris and Shanghai is approximately eight hours. (Kuomintang News Agency dispatch, 1 AM, 17th)</p>
<p>(Paris) During the first meeting of the League of Nations Council today, Chairman and French Foreign Minister Briand, after delivering the opening address, read through the entire Sino-Japanese dispute over Liaoning and Jilin provinces, and also recounted the Japanese promise to accept the resolutions in September and October, and the letter from Chinese Chief Representative Shi conveying the Chinese National Government's compliance with the resolutions. Briand further stated that the League of Nations Council should still seek a peaceful resolution to the Sino-Japanese dispute. The meeting was adjourned at 4:30 PM, followed by a closed-door discussion. (Kuomintang News Agency dispatch, 2 AM, 17th)</p>
<p>(Paris) During the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting this afternoon, Chairman Briand explained to the Administrative Council members and world public opinion the efforts he and the Secretariat had made to prevent the Sino-Japanese dispute from escalating into open war. Briand would reiterate the origin of the dispute and the difficulties encountered, whether resolved or not. He would also emphasize that if the ongoing consultations failed, the consequences would be extremely dire. It is unlikely that anyone other than Briand would speak at today's afternoon meeting. Both parties involved are eager to present their arguments and are preparing documents to be read to the Administrative Council, but the Administrative Council may postpone allowing both parties to speak until tomorrow. Such a public meeting would follow private talks, which have already begun. (Havas Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today, it is generally expected that the Manchurian issue will only be addressed in broad strokes. The various related issues cannot be resolved in a short time. The Administrative Council's resolution of October 24 requested the Chinese and Japanese governments to begin direct negotiations after the withdrawal of Japanese troops. This was passed unanimously by the Administrative Council, except for Japan. This shows that the Administrative Council recognizes that Sino-Japanese negotiations cannot be completely resolved by troop withdrawal alone. Therefore, effective guarantees must be proposed to ensure a peaceful resolution to this issue. If the Administrative Council can provide these guarantees, it will make a great contribution to the world. Regarding US cooperation, there will be no difference whether the US joins the Administrative Council or not, because the US will have close cooperation with the Administrative Council in seeking a peaceful resolution to this issue. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The French Foreign Ministry will open its doors at 4 PM today, and the main act of the League of Nations will begin half an hour later. The focus is on the Manchurian issue. Although the two opposing parties, China and Japan, remain unchanged, the characters in the play have been slightly altered. Some quarters now believe that Briand's attitude may change slightly due to pressure from the French General Staff. Although he sympathizes greatly with the League of Nations, he cannot but act according to the government's wishes. Sir Simon's first appearance as the British Foreign Secretary has attracted much attention. This morning, he spoke with Briand for three-quarters of an hour, entirely in French. Both Britain and France hope to reach a compromise solution to the Sino-Japanese dispute by the end of this week. It is expected that the Chinese and Japanese representatives will inevitably have a verbal battle at the beginning of the Administrative Council's discussion, but it can eventually become moderate, so that the fate of China, Japan, and the League of Nations can all be preserved. The League of Nations believes that in addition to the military faction, Japan also has a large civilian interest. The resolution of the Manchurian issue is of great benefit to the civilians, and it is hoped that Japan can ultimately focus on the civilian aspect. The various delegations have been extremely active all day today. Two types of negotiations are currently underway simultaneously. One is Briand's efforts to draft the agenda for this afternoon's meeting, hoping that the meeting will not be long, but this may not be easy. Briand's speech will definitely be in the nature of a painkiller, but the Chinese and Japanese representatives will continue to speak, and their speeches may be very long. The other is negotiations on the overall issue. US Ambassador Dawes is very active in these consultations. Although it is not yet possible to mention any concrete plan, it is expected that a "New Dawes Plan" may emerge to solve this current difficulty. Dawes also visited Matsudaira and will discuss matters with Sir Simon this afternoon. In addition to preparing for the meeting, Briand also participated in these talks. Simon told Briand that he may have to return to London on Thursday to attend an important cabinet meeting. If the Sino-Japanese dispute is still unresolved at that time, he can come to Paris again. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Paris) British Foreign Secretary Simon arrived here at 3:30 PM this afternoon. British Ambassador Campbell and representatives of French Foreign Minister Briand welcomed him at the station. Japanese Ambassador to the UK, Matsudaira, arrived in Paris in the same car and was received by François-Poncet. British representative Cecil will arrive at 10 PM tonight. Polish Foreign Minister Zaleski and Spanish Foreign Minister Lerroux are already in Paris. German representatives Prittwitz and Mutius are both expected to arrive tonight. On the way from London to Paris, Matsudaira had a long private conversation with British Foreign Secretary Simon. After arriving, Matsudaira immediately met with Dawes for a deep discussion. Dawes had also met with Matsudaira before leaving the UK. Although the US representative will not join the Administrative Council, the major role it will play in future negotiations seems to have been indicated by this conversation.

<h3>Shi Zhaoji Meets with Representatives from Various Countries</h3>
<p>(Paris) After arriving in Paris, Chinese Chief Representative Shi Zhaoji met with US Ambassador Dawes for a long time this afternoon, detailing China's attitude towards the Northeast incident. According to a US embassy staff member, Dawes will stay in Paris for several days. Although he will not participate in the actual discussions, he is prepared to offer his opinions at any time and is expected to meet with Briand frequently. (Kuomintang News Agency dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Chinese Chief Representative Shi Zhaoji met with US Ambassador Dawes and Japanese Ambassador Matsudaira today, just hours before the reopening of the Council. Afterwards, Shi told people that US Ambassador Dawes did not want to submit a compromise plan to the Council. Dawes told him that the US government had not drafted a compromise plan, as there was no such thing as a compromise at the moment. The Japanese troops must either withdraw or stay. Japan has repeatedly promised since September 30 to withdraw its troops to the South Manchurian Railway Zone and is also bound by the Council's resolutions in October. Therefore, China believes that today's meeting of the Council is a matter between Japan and the League of Nations. This issue is very clear: Japan must withdraw its troops, or else it will break its promise to the League of Nations. China will maintain its original position and accept any resolutions of the Council, but there can be no compromise at the moment. Shi drafted a new declaration this morning, which will be read after the Council meeting this afternoon. Its content will mainly be a summary of the repeated reports of Japanese atrocities to the Council in recent days. (Kuomintang News Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Chinese Chief Representative Shi Zhaoji also met with League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond. Drummond then met with US Ambassador Dawes and Japanese Ambassador Matsudaira. Subsequently, French Foreign Minister Briand first received British Foreign Secretary Simon, then invited Soviet Ambassador Dovgalevsky. While Briand and Dovgalevsky were meeting, US Ambassador Dawes held a second conversation with Matsudaira. It is noted that Briand has met with the Soviet Ambassador twice in two days, mentioning the necessity of the Soviet Union maintaining neutrality in the Sino-Japanese dispute over the Northeast. (Kuomintang News Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>Japan's Reply to Us Regarding the Troop Withdrawal Issue</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Chinese government sent a note to the Japanese government on November 4, requesting the withdrawal of troops stationed in Manchuria. The Japanese government sent a reply note to the Chinese Embassy here tonight. The note is very long, listing various cases to prove that China deliberately aggravated the situation in Manchuria. It then cites several events to prove that the Chinese government was involved in the nationwide anti-Japanese movement. It then firmly stated that the League of Nations resolution of October 24 did not receive unanimous agreement and therefore could not be implemented, and that China's demand that Japan fulfill the provisions of the resolution shows that China is actually trying to force the League of Nations to act in its own interest. The League of Nations resolution of September 30 did not set a time limit. Japan intended to act in accordance with the resolution, but China failed to do so because China did not attempt to restore normal relations between the two countries, and instead deliberately aggravated the situation. The final paragraph, after refuting the various points stated in China's note of October 30, firmly stated that unless China recognizes the dignity of treaties and abandons its policy of using anti-foreign movements to achieve its goals, peace in the Far East will remain in danger. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>A Strange Proposal from the League of Nations: Advocating for the Appointment of Another Military Governor for the Eastern Provinces</h3>
<p>(Paris) There is a strange proposal here that is about to be submitted to the Council. It advocates that the Council ask China to appoint another military governor for the three eastern provinces, whose strength is sufficient to suppress bandits and who is also acceptable to the Japanese. The idea is that Japan has huge financial, industrial, and railway interests in the three eastern provinces and will welcome a military governor who is capable of suppressing bandits. Therefore, this measure should be easier to implement than sending a League of Nations military commission. (Kuomintang News Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>Veterans of the European War Eagerly Hope for a Peaceful Resolution of the Dispute</h3>
<p>The Veterans of the European War Association in Reims, France, passed a resolution stating that the majority of countries, such as Germany, Britain, Austria, the United States, Italy, France, and Portugal, all those who participated in the war and suffered harm, gathered here, hand in hand. This shows that those who use the current political and economic difficulties to incite various nationalities to hate each other are not tolerated by public opinion. This city was severely damaged by the war and has only recently been repaired. Veterans of the war gathered here, their common aspiration being that countries abandon their suspicions and repair their relations, and that all nationalities, in an organized peace, can safely share justice and bear joint responsibility. It was then decided to send a telegram to Briand stating that the veterans of the war and those who suffered harm, representing 8 million people from 12 countries, respectfully express their sincere intentions to the highest representative of the League of Nations, the Administrative Council, urging them to resolve disputes that endanger peace based on our spiritual strength. We are frank and ask the two great countries, China and Japan, to respect the Kellogg-Briand Pact and accept the measures taken by the Administrative Council, so that new incidents will not occur and the dispute can be resolved peacefully. (Havas Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>The United States is Quite Optimistic About the Future of the League of Nations</h3>
<p>(Washington) Officials at the State Department here announced today that they are quite optimistic about the future of the League of Nations Council, which will convene in Paris on Monday, because a solution to the dispute between China and Japan can be found. The fact that Japan's attitude has become more moderate than before is also one of the reasons for optimism. The previous rumor that the Soviet Union was assisting Chinese troops has now been proven inaccurate. US officials feel relieved, and they are particularly satisfied that Japan has repeatedly stated that it does not want to create a conflict with the Soviet Union. In the future, US Ambassador to the UK, Dawes, will report the situation of the Paris conference to the State Department from time to time, but Dawes will not participate in the Council's discussions, so his position is different from that of US observer Mr. Gilbert in the previous Council meeting. (Kuomintang News Agency dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>The US Mediation Plan Reported by the British and French Sides</h3>
<p>Urge Japan to Withdraw its Troops Indefinitely; The Treaty Issue Can Be Submitted to Arbitration if Necessary</p>
<p>London Today's London Daily Telegraph published a稿 from its foreign affairs correspondent, saying that as a result of the meetings between British Foreign Secretary Simon and US Ambassador Dawes and Japanese Ambassador Matsudaira in London, and between French Foreign Minister Briand and Japanese Ambassador François-Poncet in Paris, a compromise solution to the Northeast incident has been reached, which will be submitted after the League of Nations Council reopens. The content is to ask Japan to reaffirm its promise to withdraw its troops, but without specifying a time limit. The League of Nations and the United States will send neutral observers to monitor the withdrawal of Japanese troops and the Chinese officials taking over the areas. As for Japan's request for China to recognize the current treaty, it will be submitted to the Hague Tribunal for arbitration if necessary. Although there is much speculation here about what actions will be taken after the Council reopens, the government has not made any statements. (Kuomintang News Agency dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Le Temps reported that the mediation plan proposed by the United States will be explained by General Dawes, who will also defend it as appropriate. No one knows the content of this mediation plan, but one point is not difficult to infer, that is, on the one hand, Japan must quickly withdraw its troops, and on the other hand, China must begin direct negotiations with Japan before the Japanese troops have completely withdrawn to the South Manchurian Railway Zone. (Havas Agency dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to today's rumors, the United States has a draft solution to the Sino-Japanese dispute. The content of the draft is unknown to the speakers. The general public believes that this new plan may not be submitted at the beginning of the meeting. General Dawes expressed the opinion during the talks that Japan should withdraw its troops as soon as possible, saying that since Tokyo has made repeated promises, withdrawal is necessary. As for whether a clear deadline must be set for the withdrawal of Japanese troops, it is generally believed that the current situation in Manchuria is not necessarily crucial. The general public agrees with the United States that the withdrawal of troops is imperative, but a deadline need not be set. As for the treaties that Japan demands to be recognized, they seem to be the following: (1) the 1905 Treaty and the Supplementary Agreement on non-competition of Manchurian railways, (2) the 1909 Treaty on Chinese railways repaired with Japanese loans, and (3) the Twenty-One Demands of 1915. The Chinese side continues to state that it has never said that it does not recognize these treaties, but the disputes arising from these treaties should be tried by the Hague International Court.

<h3>The British Press Criticizes the League of Nations for Poor Handling, Leading to a Serious Sino-Japanese Situation; Some Even Advocate for Stopping the Payment of Membership Fees</h3>
<p>London Today, all quarters believe that the success or failure of the major event in Paris this week is uncertain. The general public feels anxious about the current situation. Newspaper criticisms mostly blame the League of Nations for poor handling, leading to a serious situation, saying that setting a deadline for troop withdrawal, especially a short deadline, is a big mistake. How can it be hoped that Japan will comply with this request? The League of Nations must now find a way to extend the time period to avoid being humiliated and to avoid conflict. However, the Hu Wen newspaper editorial this morning stated that Articles 15 and 16 of the League of Nations Covenant give the League of Nations full power to deal with such urgent events. The League of Nations should show the courage to use any power necessary to maintain peace. This is the most important point. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>The London Daily Express published an editorial saying that the League of Nations is not far from its death, and the British people should demand that the government suspend the payment of membership fees. (Havas Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>The Credibility of the League of Nations is Shaken; The French Press Ridicules Our Over-Reliance</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Paris Debates said that the 65th meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council opened in a very gloomy atmosphere. This statement can represent the French concept. Everyone feels that the mystery of China is the most confusing. French public opinion is divided, with some recognizing Japan as the guarantor of law and order in a bandit-ridden area, and others saying that China is a weak country seeking help from the League of Nations. In any case, the credibility of the League of Nations itself is currently wavering. Although China trusts the League of Nations, Japan cannot but doubt the usefulness of the League of Nations.

<h3>Chiang Kai-shek's Speech at the Finance Committee Meeting</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Finance Committee of the National Government held its first meeting on the 15th. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek delivered an opening speech, the original text of which is as follows:</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the National Government, committees related to finance have been established many times to seek to reorganize finances and supervise national treasury revenue and expenditure. However, the candidates for its members were all government officials. The establishment of this committee this time recruited people from all walks of life in industry, commerce, finance, education, in order to ensure that the national finances can be mutually linked with national finance and economic education. It is expected to gather ideas and benefit widely. Long-term financial plans urgently need detailed discussion. The current financial situation should be reported first. Military and government expenses have increased over the years, while national tax revenue has failed to keep pace. The annual deficit is getting larger and larger, relying entirely on borrowing to make up for the losses. If this continues, it will be difficult to sustain. There is no other way but to vigorously seek to increase revenue and reduce expenditure. Now the Minister of Military Affairs and the Minister of Finance are both members of this committee and attended this meeting. I hope to report the situation of military and government expenses and the financial situation in detail, and ask the committee members to discuss in detail and properly discuss the ways to increase revenue and reduce expenditure, and prepare for the government to adopt them.

<p>(Hong Kong) With the cessation of the Yue government's affairs and after the closing of the Fourth National Congress, the Ning-Yue renewed peace talks. The representatives were to be chosen from the 48 members of the Central Committee from the first, second, and third sessions of the Ning and Yue, with 24 from each side. Those selected by the Yue side were not to be selected by the Ning side, and vice versa. The Yue side proposed Shanghai as the location of the peace talks and is currently seeking the consent of the Ning side. According to this method, there are slight differences from the resolutions of the Shanghai conference. Separately, it is reported that the representatives of the Yue Fourth National Congress are now divided into two factions, and whether to proceed according to the Shanghai conference's method still needs to be voted on. Although the resolutions of the Shanghai conference were generally accepted by the Extraordinary Council on the 15th, they still need to be finally decided by the Fourth National Congress.

<h3>Japanese Army Determined to Invade Qiqihar</h3>
<p>Replenishing Strength, Dispatching Heavy Artillery Regiment</p>
<p>Using Light Cavalry to Disrupt Our Defensive Line Troops</p>
<p>Heihe Army has Established Defenses in Fularji</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: The Japanese army is pressuring Ma Zhanshan, engaging in fierce battles at Jiangqiao Station. After winning against the Japanese in a four-day battle, Ma sent a telegraph to report to all parties. However, because communication organs in Hei Province are not functioning properly, evidence of the Japanese army's insistence on occupying Qiqihar was only received here today. This shows Ma's vigor and determination. The original telegram stated: "Japan's ambition to plot against Northern Manchuria is exposed and known worldwide. There is no need to hide it. This time, they are using the excuse of repairing the Jiangqiao Bridge to launch a large-scale attack. Our army is trying to defend itself and can only engage in skirmishes. Fierce battles have been ongoing for days, attacking day and night. The Japanese army's demands for Ma Zhanshan to step down is evidence of their will to kill and maim. Our army has suffered heavy casualties. The Japanese army's weapons are advanced, surpassing ours a hundredfold. Knowing that communication with Jiang Province is cut off and calls for assistance are unanswered, how can we resist a major enemy like Japan with the strength of one corner of the country? The officers and soldiers at the front all understand the great righteousness, are passionate and indignant, and have a strong sense of shared hatred against the enemy. Moreover, Zhanshan has been deeply entrusted by the country and heavily relied upon by the people. Seeing Liaoning and Jilin fall and Jiang Province in a precarious situation, rather than losing territory and abandoning the elders, it is better to sacrifice everything and fight to the end. If blessed by Heaven, we may be able to maintain it for a time and obtain a final stroke of luck. Today, Japanese troops repeatedly sent aircraft to continuously bombard us, while also mobilizing forces to gradually advance. Observing the situation, I fear that a large-scale attack will be launched in the shortest period of time. Zhanshan is responsible for defending the territory and, as long as there is a breath left, will never allow an inch of land to fall into the hands of foreign races. I will adhere to my original intention, engage in skirmishes, and insist on not yielding. I hope that those who are wise in the country will understand and discern this. In addition to vowing to lead the officers and soldiers at the front to fight to the death, I have also telegraphed the League of Nations to request that measures be taken to stop them, and I am waiting for a fair resolution from the countries of the world. I earnestly implore all elders in the country to strive for improvement to save the dying. I am filled with extreme indignation." Acting Chairman of Heilongjiang Province, Ma Zhanshan, respectfully reports. Evidence of the Japanese army forcing the repair of the Nenjiang Bridge (1)</p>
<p>Hongqiyingzi: After the Hei army defeated the Japanese army, the front lines have entered a state of ceasefire. Ma then returned to the provincial capital at 2:00 PM on the 8th with his guard regiment to take command, ordering Deputy Commander Xie Ke to go to the front to take charge of everything. Although there is temporary stability inside and outside the provincial capital, a renewed attack by the Japanese army is inevitable. In addition to ordering the officers and soldiers at the front to dig new-style trenches for long-term defense, he also ordered all officials in the provincial capital to intensify their work, without resting on Sundays, to avoid delaying military opportunities. While the soldiers are working so hard, some who are greedy for life still cannot feel at ease. Zhao Zhongren, a member of the Provincial Committee, is one of the most forceful advocates for peaceful retreat. Before the outbreak of hostilities, Zhao, in his capacity as a representative of the people of Hei Province, privately contacted Shimizu, the Japanese consul in Qiqihar, and agreed to many conditions, including Ma Zhanshan ceding the provincial capital and Hei Province electing six representatives to welcome Zhang Haipeng to take charge of Hei's administration. Unexpectedly, before the conditions could be realized, the war broke out at the front, and Zhao was already despised by Shimizu. However, Zhao still refused to abandon his proposal. On the 9th of this month, he came to Harbin again, still in the name of a representative of Hei Province, to contact Ohashi, the Japanese consul in Harbin. Ohashi also refused to see him. Zhao wandered around Harbin for three days, and dissatisfied with his unfulfilled aspirations, he reluctantly returned to Hei today. Before this, Zhao had served as the Daoyin of Hulunbuir during the anti-Russian campaign, and was known as a traitor for supplying the enemy with grain. Unexpectedly, his inferior nature has not changed in several years. With this person in Hei Province, Ma's military actions may ultimately be constrained. As for the three lines of defense in the Jiangqiao area, the trenches have all been built, and communication trenches have been dug to connect each trench.

In the afternoon of the same day, two more planes came, using machine guns to strafe downwards and drop more than 30 bombs, injuring three cavalrymen and three horses from Wu Songshan's unit. Most of the bombs dropped did not explode. Upon inspecting the shell casings, the words "Showa 6th Year" were found, which can serve as evidence for future negotiations. At 7:00 PM on the 10th, more than 1,000 Japanese troops appeared between Sijiazi and Jiucaigou. This location is about 15 li from our defensive line. Our army did not engage in battle because they did not make any moves. At noon on the 9th, refugee farmers fled from Jingxing and arrived at Ang'angxi, reporting to the military authorities that more than 1,000 troops resembling Japanese soldiers were discovered between Jingxing and Tuquan, advancing forward. In the afternoon of the same day, about 30 li from the Fularji Station on the Harbin-Manzhouli Railway, Japanese troops and Zhang Haipeng's forces, numbering about 700, attacked our Black Gang and Zhulikan defending troops, and were repelled after our troops killed dozens of them. On the morning of the 10th, Yuan, the brigade commander of the 1st Brigade of the Hei Army Infantry, and Cheng, the brigade commander of the 2nd Brigade of Cavalry, traveled to Zhulikan together on a special train to inspect and deploy defenses. The two brigade commanders went at 9:30 AM and returned to Ang'angxi at 12:00 PM. Then, at 12:45 PM, they went to the front of the Nenjiang Bridge for inspection. According to the two brigade commanders, a regiment of the 1st Brigade of Infantry and two companies of cavalry have been dispatched to deploy defenses in that area. On the same day, before the two brigade commanders boarded the train to Jiangqiao, four Japanese aircraft flew to Ang'angxi Station and dropped eight bombs on the station. Because the flight was very high, all of them fell outside the station. Regarding the Japanese army, its military plan seems to have been changed to detour, using surprise attacks to seize Qiqihar. The front is harassed by aircraft and a small number of troops alternately to disrupt our line of sight. The Japanese troops appearing near Jingxing on the 9th are their detour troops. According to military observers, the success of this plan is extremely slow because entering from Jingxing takes at least ten days to cross Ang'angxi, and another two days to reach Qiqihar. The area is a flat plain, and troops are not easily concealed, so their movements are easily spotted. However, Commander Domen of the 2nd Division arrived in Taonan the day before yesterday. The heavy artillery regiment from Lushun passed through Gongzhuling and opened to Taonan on the evening of the 10th. The elite Japanese soldiers of the Kwantung Army are gathered between Tailai and the town to the east. It is expected that a full-scale invasion will be launched within days. It is heard that the National Salvation Army, numbering more than 3,000, has been discovered near Taonan, led by the chivalrous robber Sanhe, disrupting Taonan and the town to the east. Zhang Haipeng dispatched Fu Jingfen and Bai Lisheng's two units, with more than 2,000 troops, to engage them in battle twice, and were defeated both times. Because of this concern in the rear, the Japanese army dispatched an artillery company and a regiment of Zhang's troops to assist on the 10th. With this resistance to the Japanese army's disturbance of Hei, the battle situation on the Taonan-Ang'angxi line has been eased for several days. (11th)</p>
<h3>Ma Zhanshan Speaks to American Reporters</h3>
<p>Will Resolutely Resist to the Last Man and Last Soldier</p>
<p>Did Not Request Assistance from Russia, No Russians in the Army</p>
<p>American Reporters Confirmed That There Was No Soviet Russian Assistance</p>
<p>Qiqihar dispatch from the American Evening News, 15th: Your reporter interviewed General Ma Zhanshan tonight. Ma stated that he is determined to defend against the Japanese invasion to the end. Even if forced to leave the province, he will lead his troops to retreat to the countryside and continue the resistance. Currently, Qiqihar is the only provincial capital in the Northeast that has not fallen into the hands of the brutal Japanese. People from all walks of life in various provinces have telegraphed me, urging me to hold on. I will fight to the death. Even if overwhelmed by the enemy's numerical superiority and forced to leave the province, I will retreat to the countryside. While Mr. Ma was talking to the reporter, the sound of heavy artillery could be clearly heard from 20 miles south, indicating that the Japanese army had resumed firing and was preparing to attack. Ma stated that in the past three days, Japanese aircraft have been scouting from time to time, circling over Qiqihar, spying on important locations such as the provincial government, armory, and barracks. It is expected that they will come to drop bombs within the next day or two. At this time, people in the provincial government all expect a major battle to be imminent. Therefore, the train from Qiqihar to Ang'angxi today was full of Chinese fleeing. The last batch of Japanese also left the country at this time. General Ma strongly refuted rumors of Soviet Russian assistance, saying that if I had received Soviet Russian assistance, it would have been easier to stop the Japanese army from crossing the Jiangqiao Bridge and advancing north. I have not received a single gun or bullet from the Russian side, nor have I requested Russian assistance. There are no Russians in my army, nor are there any revolutionary elements as falsely claimed by the Japanese. I am defending against a strong enemy with an isolated army. No matter the outcome, as long as there is one man and one soldier left, I will resolutely resist to the end. Your reporter inspected the front lines and confirmed that there was no evidence of Soviet Russian assistance. The only Russians seen were a few impoverished White Russians, with their wives and children, sitting listlessly at Ang'angxi Station, seemingly waiting for a train to Harbin. General Ma grew up in the Northeast, is about five feet tall, about forty years old, and has a heroic spirit. In the reception room of his yamen, there was a box of Russian cigarettes and a bottle of champagne. General Ma took the wine and urged the reporter to drink, but he did not touch it himself. General Ma also stated that the Japanese send him messages almost daily. The most recent one was delivered yesterday morning, with simple wording, demanding that I immediately cede power to the person they want to establish. The reporter asked who that was. Ma replied, General Zhang Haipeng. But I heard that although Zhang is under Japanese control, a portion of his troops have defected and are loyal to the central government. The reporter also asked about his attitude towards the League of Nations. Zhang glanced at the calendar and said that in less than 24 hours, the deadline set by the League of Nations for the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops would be reached. I believe the League of Nations will uphold international justice and fairness. The Japanese claimed that they would not invade Northeastern territory, but now they have deceived the whole world. Therefore, I am defending the territory, hoping that the League of Nations will provide assistance and force the Japanese troops to withdraw. What China needs today is nothing more than fairness. I am waiting quietly for the League of Nations to indicate whether it intends to implement its orders. When the reporter arrived in Qiqihar before midnight, he saw a crowd gathered on the station platform, including many Japanese, all wearing heavy fur coats and leather hats, surrounded by a cordon of burly Chinese soldiers. The Japanese standing in front of them were like dwarfs. Another group of Chinese gathered on the platform to watch the Japanese, all with anger on their faces. Before long, a locomotive and a train approached the platform. Chinese soldiers helped the Japanese retrieve their luggage and helped them board the train. Your reporter also followed them, catching a glimpse of Japanese Consul Shimizu and his nine staff members also in the crowd. Qiqihar originally had 150 Japanese, and this was the last batch leaving the country. Shimizu was stunned to see an American correspondent on the train, initially appearing embarrassed and uneasy, claiming that he was going to Harbin on official business. He then admitted that because the Japanese army was about to attack and he feared that the Chinese army would be defeated and insulted by the mob, he had no choice but to leave with his staff. Shimizu also stated that he had been corresponding with General Ma Zhanshan daily and had been treated with great courtesy. Before leaving, he had also received all kinds of conveniences. The train arrived at Ang'angxi Station, and Chinese soldiers escorted the Japanese onto the Chinese Eastern Railway night train and prepared first-class sleeping cars for them to go to Harbin.</p>
<p>There are several American missionaries in Qiqihar. Yesterday, the American Consul General in Harbin, Hanlin, issued a warning, ordering them to leave the country. Because it was dark and General Ma Zhanshan was about to go to the front line and was eager to pay respects, I was unable to inquire about the whereabouts of the missionaries. But I heard that the Dutch Consul in Harbin is currently here, having been dispatched yesterday on behalf of the League of Nations to investigate whether there is Soviet Russian assistance as claimed by the Japanese. Also, it is expected that U.S. Army Attaché Captain Denglai is also within Heilongjiang Province, probably investigating in Hailar at this time. It is heard that General Ma's troops engaged in fierce battles near Nenjiang for three days, with a total of 400 dead and 300 wounded. In the past three days, they have been bombed by Japanese artillery and aircraft, with 30 dead and 20 wounded. The wounded are all being treated in a small hospital in Qiqihar.</p>
<h3>The Situation in Wuhan Remains Serious</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Since the Tianjin Incident, the number of Japanese warships on the Han River has been continuously increasing. Japanese residents from all over have come to Wuhan to organize so-called volunteer armies, youth groups, and yellow volunteer corps, intensifying military training, and the situation is deteriorating. The indignation of our people is also growing as a result. The Wuhan authorities, in order to avoid Japanese provocations, earnestly encourage calm struggle and declare that anyone who dares to be used by others to disrupt order will be punished with the death penalty. At the same time, Zhou Zechun, a diplomatic inspector of five provinces, also sent letters to the consuls of various countries, stating that if the Japanese use destructive policies, please give China sympathy. The situation of all parties is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Tension in the Japanese Concession: The situation in the Japanese Concession has become increasingly serious recently. The Japanese Consulate General ordered Japanese residents on the Chinese streets to move into the concession before the 13th. Japanese residents from various places upstream of the Yangtze River and from Changsha and Wuxue have also been transferred to Wuhan. Except for a part that went to Shanghai and returned to their country, the rest were organized into volunteer armies. Those between the ages of 15 and 18 were organized into youth groups, and hooligans and local ruffians were recruited to form yellow volunteer corps, intensifying military training. Ishikawa Katsutoshi, the director of the youth training center, issued a notice on the 13th, ordering all trainees to train daily at the Meiji Elementary School's grand parade ground. Army officer Morioka and Consul Itagaki all went to give speeches. The volunteer army practices street fighting fully armed in the Japanese Concession every night at 11:00 PM. The secret meetings held daily by the captains of various ships, the naval commander, the army officer, and the consuls of various places have been moved to the Marine Corps Department. The department stores a large number of guns and ammunition, including more than a dozen machine guns, six small cannons, 200 rifles, and more than 100 portable cannons, with more than 40 gunners. A munitions repair shop has now been established, contracted by the Sakurai Iron Factory.</p>
<p>Investigation of the Strength of Japanese Warships Anchored in Wuhan: The Japanese warships anchored in Wuhan have been slightly adjusted during the day. There are currently eight ships in Wuhan, including one first-class gunboat, the Ataka, with more than 130 officers and soldiers. The ship has a displacement of 820 tons, a speed of 1600, two 12 cm main guns, six side guns, one aircraft, 30 portable machine guns, and 12 new-style large machine guns. There is one second-class gunboat, the Katata, with a displacement of 620 tons, a speed of 1300, four 8 cm main guns, four side small guns, 12 new-style large machine guns, and six portable machine guns, with more than 100 officers and soldiers. There is one first-class destroyer, the Urakaze, with a displacement of 907 tons, a speed of 2800, two 13 cm main guns, four side guns, two torpedoes, 12 portable guns, and eight machine guns, with more than 80 officers and soldiers. There are three second-class destroyers, the Hinoki, Kashi, and Momo, each with a displacement of 835 tons, a speed of 3150, three 12 cm main guns, one anti-aircraft gun, six machine guns, and ten portable machine guns, each with more than 60 officers and soldiers. There is one reconnaissance ship, the Kotaka, with two machine guns and more than 20 officers and soldiers. The Fushimi warship recently came to Wuhan, and its strength cannot be investigated. In addition to cannons and machine guns, each soldier on the above ships has two rifles, each officer has two pistols, and they are equipped with bombs, etc. As for the Hirato warship, it has now sailed to Shanghai, carrying important documents.</p>
<p>Saltazawa's Strong and Unreasonable Statement: It is heard that Naval Commander Saltazawa inspected various ships after arriving in Wuhan and summoned all officers and soldiers to give speeches, the content of which is unknown. Recently, Saltazawa summoned Japanese merchants in Hankou to a meeting, stating that if the Wuhan anti-Japanese association confiscates Japanese goods, the Japanese merchants should quickly report to the Navy or the Consulate, and the Marines will be dispatched to take them back by force. According to an unofficial report from a certain party, Saltazawa also declared to Japanese merchants and civilians that Japan is fully prepared along the Yangtze River, and Hankou is also extremely meticulous. If necessary, it will protect overseas Chinese merchants by force, regardless of everything. His provocative intentions against us are obvious.</p>
<p>Zhou Zechun's Statement to Various Consuls: Zhou Zechun, a diplomatic inspector of five provinces, stated that the Japanese are preparing to launch a large-scale provocation, and it is not difficult to apply the means of seizing Liaoning and Jilin and disturbing Tianjin to Wuhan. The future danger is particularly worrying. On the 13th, he sent letters to the consuls general and deputy consuls of various countries, including Britain, the United States, France, Italy, and Belgium, making a statement that if the Japanese adopt destructive policies, he hopes that the consuls will uphold justice and give China sympathy.</p>
<p>Police Department's Proclamation to Maintain Public Order: The Wuhan Garrison Headquarters issued a proclamation to the citizens yesterday, saying, "At a time when the diplomatic situation is serious, the local order and tranquility are extremely important. All of our people should maintain order and abide by the law. The following three things are strictly prohibited: (1) If there are traitors and ruffians who are induced and bought by others, pretending to be patriotic, but in fact engaging in subversive activities to incite diplomatic incidents, they will be executed without mercy. (2) Laborers working under foreign investment who have been dismissed should, if there are legitimate issues between labor and capital that have not been resolved, report to our competent authorities for negotiation or relief. Direct negotiation is absolutely prohibited. Violators will be arrested. If direct negotiation leads to a serious diplomatic incident, the death penalty will be imposed. (3) During this serious period, all meetings and associations must first report to the Wuhan Camp of the General Commander of the Army, Navy, and Air Force for approval, and then report to this headquarters for the garrison agencies and troops to be notified. Otherwise, they will be ordered to disband or be detained. In addition to reporting separately for orders, all are hereby proclaimed to strictly comply. (November 13th)</p>

<p>A Case of Husband Allegedly Beating His Wife to Death: In Liuxiangli, near Yanqiao (Tianshang City) in the fifth district of the county, Qin Apeipei, a villager, is a farmer. His family is well-off. He has a son, Abing, who married Hu, a child bride. They were married last year, and the couple was harmonious. On the 13th of this month, Hu returned to her mother's home due to some matter. Unexpectedly, the next day, her body was suddenly discovered in the Zhangjingbang River, not far from Qin's home. After someone reported it, the Qin family tried to salvage it and carried it back home to prepare for the coffin and burial. After hearing the news, the mother of the deceased raised concerns. According to outside rumors, the deceased committed suicide by throwing herself into the river after being beaten and humiliated by the Qin family father and son. It is said that there were also wounds on the deceased's body, and there are other circumstances. After hearing the news, Fu Qin, the director of the 13th Public Security Branch, came to the city the day before yesterday because the case concerned a human life and sent a letter to the county court requesting a coroner's examination. The prosecutor's office reported that it was too late to conduct a coroner's examination, and the next morning (the 16th) at 9:00 AM, Prosecutor Du, accompanied by Secretary Ni and two coroner's clerks Shen and Wang, went to the countryside to conduct a coroner's examination. At the same time, Zhou Longhui, the chief of the neighborhood, and Hu Rongtai, the father of the deceased, reported to the prosecutor's office requesting to waive the coroner's examination, but were not approved. After Prosecutor Du and others arrived in the countryside, they conducted a coroner's examination according to law. It was found that the deceased had died in the river after being injured before death. Because the deceased's husband, Abing, had escaped without a trace, his father, Qin Apeipei, was taken to the court for questioning. Qin admitted in court that he had beaten her and was ordered to be detained pending the arrest and interrogation of Abing. The body of Hu is now being prepared for burial by her father, Hu Rongtai.</p>

<h3>He Jian Submits a Proposal to the Fourth Plenary Session for Adding Civics Courses to Primary and Secondary School Curricula</h3>
<p>Changsha Dispatch: He Jian, Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Government, went to Beijing on the 8th of this month to attend the Fourth Plenary Session. Believing that the resolutions of the session concern the entire nation, and observing that people from all walks of life today largely disregard China's inherent morality, that hearts are shallow, and society is uneasy, he believes that it is difficult to achieve tangible results without addressing the root causes. Therefore, he has specially proposed to the session that civics courses be added to primary and secondary school curricula as a means of remedy. The full text of his proposal is recorded below:</p>
<p>(A) Main Text: Civics courses should be added to primary and secondary school curricula to maintain the inherent morality of the nation and save the drowning hearts of the people. (B) Rationale: Since the reform in our country, although material things have strived towards civilization, people's hearts have become increasingly shallow. There is historical materialism and proletarian literature to tempt young people, and there are Third International communist bandits who carry out treacherous acts against farmers and workers. The pain caused by the poisonous flames will not cease until human nature and morality are completely destroyed. To save the situation, we must rely on education. Before the early years of the Republic of China, primary and secondary school curricula originally had a subject called "Self-Cultivation," which taught people the way to conduct themselves, treat others, and fulfill their responsibilities to family, society, the nation, and humanity. It was not until the eighth or ninth year of the Republic of China that the scope of the "Self-Cultivation" subject was expanded and renamed "Civics," with an even greater significance. To mold healthy citizens, they must be enriched with healthy knowledge and trained in healthy personalities. Primary and secondary school education is the foundation for cultivating national character and should not be neglected. Learning from the past and being wary of the future, it is necessary to add civics subjects to primary and secondary education to train the people and guide their direction. Some argue that civics is already included in the Party Principles course and does not need to be added again. However, Party Principles are the basic concepts of the entire national independence and have broader implications and higher ideals. Using them to train young people in primary and secondary schools, whose wills are not yet determined, may be difficult for them to fully understand. It seems better to restore the previous civics course, incorporating the knowledge that citizens should possess and China's inherent morality into the subject, as concrete and practical training, to save the drowning hearts of the people and reverse the tide. (C) Measures: (1) The Central Executive Committee should consult the National Government and instruct the Ministry of Education to add civics courses to higher primary and junior high school curricula. (2) Civics teaching materials should be carefully selected by the Ministry of Education, and curriculum standards should be compiled. The part on civic morality should adopt as much of China's inherent morality as possible, such as loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, trustworthiness, righteousness, harmony, and peace, for active training, in order to live up to the Deputy General's call to promote and develop it.</p>

<h3>Anti-Japanese Student Associations of Various Universities to Hold Executive Committee Meeting Today</h3>

The propaganda guidelines for this week have been distributed to all schools for propaganda purposes. The propaganda guidelines are as follows: 1. The Japanese government's failure to comply with the League of Nations' resolution to withdraw troops within the time limit requires all Chinese people to rise up and take effective self-defense actions to drive the Japanese aggressor troops out of the country. 2. All Chinese people must rise up to support Heilongjiang's efforts to resist Japan and fight to the end. 3. Unanimously request the government to declare war on Japan immediately. 4. China should immediately withdraw from the League of Nations, which cannot stop the tyranny of Japan. 5. Promote peaceful unification to overcome national difficulties together.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Universities Receive Firearms</h3>

<p>Also Suffers Setback</p>
<p>Macklin's Stamina is Formidable</p>
<p>Macklin Brown's ball was the fuse for the battle between the two sides. Also Zheng Zhifang also scored a point from a penalty, pressing very closely. In the silver whistle sound, Macklin Brown reported successive victories, and soon took the lead with 10 to 1. The general trend fell, also sang a marching song, rising step by step, for a long time, surpassing with 14 to 13, the situation was tense, and the heartstrings of the audience were shaken. After the score of 19 equalized, there was another dispute. Macklin was ahead with 22 to 20 in the first half. At the beginning of the second half, Also first made a strong move, and Guan Xia scored a point from each penalty, resulting in a tie score, and hope came. Suddenly, Graham Brown and others joined forces to invade, the pass was lost, the situation turned again, the rescue was ineffective, and Also eventually failed with 28 to 46.</p>

<h3>John Demonstrates Power</h3>
<p>Jinan's General Injured</p>
<p>Jinan's Huang Zhaolin, known for his accurate shooting, was injured and left the field after breaking his nasal bone while displaying his martial prowess. It is difficult for Jinan to be called a strong team, and it is difficult to compete with John. Moreover, John's strategy is excellent, the team is neat, and the leading position is always maintained. John Hou Xuemin first scored for his team, and Jinan Li Chengyuan scored under the basket, resulting in an equal score. Both sides were able to intercept the ball in the air, so it was not easy to find the basket. Soon, John Chen Xianglong and Saint Shou Totto each succeeded, and John took the lead. When Jinan was gradually rising and about to confront, Huang Zhaolin was injured and left the field again, and John was able to take the lead with 18 to 15 in the first half. In the second half, John was consistent inside and out and continued to dominate. Jinan tried to resist but was ultimately ineffective. As a result, John won with 40 to 30.</p>

<p>Wings Lost Due to Pride</p>
<p>Sakhalin Has Courage</p>
<p>The Wings team is organized by Fudan Middle School, and the whole team is agile and nimble, and extremely fast. Sakhalin is brave but lacks strategy and is clumsy in response. At the beginning of the game, the Wings team was far ahead with 13 to 3, which aroused their pride and reduced their skills. Sakhalin scored eight points in a row. In the first half, the Wings team had 13 points and Sakhalin had 9 points. In the second half, Sakhalin became more and more colorful, and they confronted each other. At the end of the game, they each scored 29 points. After a 5-minute extension, Sakhalin came from behind with 35 to 33. Referee Lu Zhongen.</p>

<h3>1931-1932 Basketball Rule Changes</h3>
<p>Chapter 1, Article 4 (Note): This note has been changed to be part of Article 4 itself, so it becomes an official part of the court diagram. The last section of this article is as follows: When taking a free throw, for the convenience of the players standing in their respective positions, a position should be marked on both sides of the free throw area. The position should be marked with the word "Home" to indicate that it is for the home team to stand, and the word "Away" to indicate that it is for the away team to stand (see court diagram).</p>
<p>Chapter 5, Article 3: The following new note has been added: When substituting players, if the coach or other person in charge is not present, the referee should confirm the substitution based on the captain's confirmation.</p>
<p>Chapter 5, Article 6 (Note): The last section of this note has been added: It is best for the players to wear numbers on the front and back of their vests or pants.</p>
<p>Chapter 6, Article 6: There is a slight modification in the wording, that is, "should order" is changed to "can order."</p>
<p>Chapter 7, Article 3 (Note): A sentence has been added to this note to explain the meaning of "backcourt". The entire note is as follows: If a player in the backcourt (that is, the half of the court farthest from the player's own basket) is guarded by an opponent within one yard of him, so that he cannot take any action, and this lasts for more than five seconds, the referee may declare a "jump ball".</p>
<p>Chapter 7, Article 7: The entire rule is as follows: The following circumstances constitute a "dead ball". When a dead ball occurs, the game should be stopped immediately, and then restarted in the manner specified by the referee. (1) When the referee or scorer blows the whistle; (2) 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 are the same as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 in the old rules; (10) In the case of successive penalties, the time of declaring a dead ball after each penalty except the last one, if it is at the time when the player throws the basket and the ball has left the hand, the ball should be valid if it is thrown in, except in the following circumstances. If a player on the same team as the thrower commits a foul or violation at the time the ball leaves the hand, the ball is invalid. If the referee declares a jump ball, even if the ball is already in the air, the ball should also be invalid if the whistle is blown first.</p>
<p>Chapter 7, Article 10: The wording has been modified, but the meaning remains the same, as follows: If a player throws, taps, bounces, or rolls the ball out, or it falls out of his hand, and then touches the ball again before it has been touched by another person, this is called "dribbling". When dribbling, except for throwing the ball into the air and tapping it once with the hand, the ball must make contact with the ground. At the beginning of dribbling, the ball may be thrown into the air, or the ball may be tapped into the air once with the hand during dribbling. If the ball stops in a player's one or both hands during dribbling, or both hands touch the ball at the same time, the dribbling ends. At this time, the player should pass the ball or throw the basket, and may not dribble again. After a legal dribble, it may be followed by a spin.</p>
<p>Chapter 8, Article 6: A sentence has been inserted as follows: According to this article, the ball can be tapped four times during a jump ball, that is, each center can tap the ball twice.</p>
<p>Chapter 9, Article 3 (Note): Has been changed to be part of this article, as follows: When junior high school or younger age teams must have a tie-breaking period, except as provided in the last sentence of this article, it should be limited to three times. If such a game requires a second tie-breaking period, there should be a five-minute break between the first and second, during which players may also leave the field. There should be a one-minute break between the second and third tie-breaking periods. If there is still no winner or loser after the second tie-breaking period, then, unless otherwise agreed upon by the person in charge during the break time after the first tie-breaking period, the team that first obtains two points during the third tie-breaking period shall be the winner. If neither team obtains two points during the third tie-breaking period, a method of resolving the win or loss may be agreed upon according to the provisions of the first sentence in this section.</p>
<p>Chapter 11, Article 1: Only the referee has the right to suspend the game. When a dead ball occurs, the referee may allow the game to be suspended for substitution of players. This suspension should not be counted if the time spent does not exceed 30 seconds. When a dead ball occurs, or when the team in possession of the ball requests a timeout during the game, the referee may allow the captain's request to suspend the game. Each such suspension is limited to one minute, and less than one minute is also counted as one suspension. When a dead ball occurs, or when a player on the team in possession of the ball is injured, or as explained in Chapter 6, Article 6, the referee may allow the game to be suspended due to the player's injury, waiting for the end of the other party's game. This suspension should be counted once, unless the injured player leaves the field within one minute.</p>
<p>Chapter 11, Article 2: Each team may request a timeout three times during the entire game, but in the event of injury or other accident, the referee may still accept its additional request and allow it to be suspended, but each additional time should be treated as a technical foul.</p>
<p>Chapter 14, Article 2 (Note): A player who violates this article during a single free throw or the last free throw in a series of free throws should have a jump ball in the center circle, regardless of whether the free throw is made or not.</p>
<p>Chapter 14, Article 7 (Penalty): If the violator is a player on the same team as the free thrower, the free throw is invalid. Regardless of whether it is made or not, there should be a jump ball in the center circle. If the violator is a player on the opposing team of the free thrower, the free throw is valid. If it is not made, the penalty is repeated once. This repeated penalty is purely to replace the original free throw. If the original free throw was penalized due to a personal foul, the game should continue if the repeated penalty is not made. If both players violate this rule, the free throw is invalid. Regardless of whether it is made or not, there should be a jump ball in the center circle. In the event of reckless behavior in the free throw area, it may be treated as a personal foul. Players may not line up on both sides of the free throw area when free throws are awarded for a technical foul or a double foul. If the same team has more than one free throw, the center circle jump ball described in the previous section shall not be applied, except for those who violate the rules during the last free throw.</p>
<p>Chapter 14, Article 9: This article adds the phrase "if the ball does not touch the rim or backboard". This article does not apply if the ball only touches the net. If the ball touches the net first and then the backboard or rim, the game continues. The entire rule is as follows: If a player does not throw the basket in good faith during a free throw and passes the ball to another player, the game shall proceed as usual after the free throw. If the ball does not go into the basket or touch the rim or backboard, the ball shall be given to the free thrower's opponent to throw the ball into the field from out of bounds.</p>
<p>Chapter 15, Article 1 (5): The following new note has been added after this article: If a player stands legally in the circle and shoots the ball into his own basket during a jump ball, it shall be valid. If the above fifth example is committed at the same time, no penalty shall be imposed.</p>
<p>Chapter 15, Article 11: The following new note has been added after this article: When a player is throwing the basket and the opponent's player's actions are unusually rude and not intended to block the ball, the referee may disqualify the violator from the game.</p>

<h3>Recollections of the Ivory Tower</h3>
<p>— Yanzi</p>
<p>In the middle of the reign of Guangxu of the declining Qing Dynasty, China and Japan became enemies due to Korea. The army had already been defeated in Pyongyang, with only Zuo Baogui dying in the line of duty. The Zhili Governor-General Li Hongzhang immediately ordered the Beiyang Fleet to sail out and engage the enemy. Naval Admiral Ding Ruchang, a veteran army general, was placed in command of the navy, a role for which he was not suited. Informed observers knew early on that defeat was inevitable. Fortunately, a German devised a strategy for defending against the enemy, allowing the fleet to organize and set sail. They encountered the Japanese fleet in the Yellow Sea. At that time, the navy's personnel were mostly from Fujian, followed by Guangdong. The Zhiyuan was only a 1,800-ton gunboat. Its captain, Deng Shichang, was from Guangdong and was often resented by those from Fujian. When the two fleets met, the flagship Zhenyuan raised its flag and issued orders. The large ships took the center, forming a line. The Japanese ships formed two wings in a V-formation, encircling the Chinese fleet, trapping the Zhenyuan and Dingyuan in the middle. Cannon fire shook the heavens, but they dared not approach, fearing the giant cannons of the two ships. As the battle intensified, the Yangwei caught fire after being hit. The Chaoyong ran aground, and the Jingyuan sank. Only the Zhiyuan, though its deck was destroyed by Japanese fire, had its captain, Deng Shichang, personally fire and sink a Japanese ship, killing over a hundred enemies. Later, seeing that the situation was hopeless, he ordered full speed ahead, attempting to ram a Japanese ship in a suicidal attack. Unfortunately, he failed to achieve his objective, and the ship sank. Thus, the loyal, brave, and heroic Captain Deng, along with two hundred brave men, were buried in the waves of the Yellow Sea. His heroic death can be compared to that of Zuo Baogui, their names forever immortalized. How magnificent, Deng Shichang!</p>

<h3>Franklin (4)</h3>
<p>One of the Biographies of Little Apprentices</p>
<p>Before I narrate how Franklin stole electricity from the sky, I must first narrate the general understanding of electricity during Franklin's time.</p>
<p>Since the dawn of humanity, everyone has seen and heard lightning and thunder in the sky. Ancient people considered such terrifying phenomena to be the result of crimes in the lower realm, causing God to become angry and send the Thunder God and Lightning Mother to subdue monsters, beasts, and evil people. They believed that thunder and lightning were deities, and those killed by the deities were extremely sinful, violating the laws of heaven. To this day, the general ignorant populace in China still holds such superstitions. The people of Europe and America during Franklin's time also held similar, albeit slightly different, views on natural electrical phenomena, often leading to bizarre jokes.</p>
<p>The history of man-made electricity is also quite ancient, but before Franklin, it only consisted of fragmented and inexplicable little tricks. Rubbing a cat's fur to produce sparks, rubbing agate to attract pith: humanity had been performing such tricks for at least two thousand years. Stephen Gray, two hundred years ago, began using silk-wrapped ropes dozens of feet long in London to conduct frictional electricity from one end to the other. This Gray was a poor old man who made a living by using electrical tricks to earn money from children. He clearly stated in writing that the nature of these sparks and sounds was very similar to thunder and lightning.</p>
<p>The Frenchman C.F. Dufay re-enacted Gray's tricks, managing to conduct frictional electricity through a wire 1,256 feet long. He was the first person to discover the dual nature of electricity, calling them Vitreous Electricity (later known as positive electricity) and Resinous Electricity (later known as negative electricity). He first discovered that when two types of electricity are brought close together, the result is that like charges repel and opposite charges attract.</p>
<h3>A Historical Film of a Weak Nation Triumphing Over a Strong Enemy</h3>
<p>— Qingqu</p>
<p>People often say, "The weak are prey to the strong." But they don't know that this is just a noun. It is not necessarily a fixed outcome. A nation's survival or demise depends entirely on the actions of its government and people. It has nothing to do with other nations. It is entirely up to them to choose. Mencius once said, "As for heroic figures, they will rise even without King Wen." This deeply and urgently instructs future rulers to be self-reliant and to resist the encroachments of powerful neighbors.</p>
<p>When I read the Spring and Autumn Annals, Hua Yuan said, "To pass us without asking for passage is to despise us. To despise us is to doom us. Killing their envoy will surely lead to an attack. To be attacked is also to doom us. It is all the same doom." He then killed the Chu envoy. The blind historian Zuo recorded these words, and when people recite them, they still feel a vibrant energy, pressing upon their minds. Why is this? In ancient times, people were so anxious about the loss of national power, they were willing to make desperate gambles, like fighting tigers with bare hands, because the tragedy of national destruction was more painful than death. The distinction between benefit and harm must be carefully considered, and the final success or failure is not even a question.</p>
<p>Externally, the Persian King Xerxes, with an army of hundreds of thousands, attempted to conquer Greece. But Leonidas personally led only a few hundred brave warriors, holding the pass to the death for months. They were able to defeat a large force with a small one, annihilating the enemy outside the borders, leaving not a single survivor. To this day, the Battle of Thermopylae's glorious name resonates among the great powers. Even a child in the West knows and admires it. This small peninsula of Greece had men who valued honor over national humiliation, thinking it better to die as a ghost on the battlefield than to live as a stateless person. Even in defeat, there is glory. Otherwise, the humiliation of slavery is more cruel than the axe. How could they endure it?</p>
<p>Even in recent times, in the Battle of Yaksa in the twenty-fourth year of the Kangxi reign of our country, Peng Chun, with 18,000 troops, trapped the Russians in a tight encirclement, directly attacking their strongholds until not a single stone remained. He even captured their brave general, Tolbuzin, and ultimately killed him. This caused the prestige of the Russian Emperor Peter to plummet in the Arctic, and the Treaty of Nerchinsk forced the Russians north of the Outer Khingan Range, unable to advance a single step south. Was this not due to the power of Peng Chun's one battle at that time? Therefore, although the forms of strength and weakness are different, the outcome of victory and defeat cannot be predicted. How can one say that those who are gentle and abide by public reason will inevitably be bullied, and that those who are brutal and inhuman can achieve their goals against me and be invincible in the world? Alas, my people can prosper!</p>

<h3>A Superficial Understanding of Milk Consumption</h3>
<p>— Xinfo</p>
<p>Milk has become the sole food in modern families; this is another aspect of Western influence spreading eastward. However, there are many types of milk, such as evaporated milk, condensed milk, milk powder, and fresh milk, each with different uses and varying qualities. Therefore, based on what I have learned, I will discuss them below, providing a reference for housewives.</p>
<p>(1) Evaporated milk is made from two gallons of fresh milk, evaporating one gallon of water using an evaporator. The nutrients are fully preserved, and the milk is thoroughly sterilized, eliminating all bacteria. Therefore, it can be stored in cans for many years while remaining as fresh as new. This is sufficient proof of its purity. After opening the can, even in summer, it will not spoil from morning until evening when exposed to air. Sometimes, when guests arrive unexpectedly and need milk, it is readily available for sale in grocery stores, in any amount desired. During evaporation, a very high concentration of sterilization is used. Once it is added to food, such as ice cream or coffee, it produces a fragrance that enhances appetite. This fragrance is not found in fresh milk, milk powder, or condensed milk. In terms of price and quality, it is actually cheaper than fresh milk. In summary, evaporated milk is the most perfect form of milk, but it is not yet commonly used in our country. This is because people are not familiar with its underlying virtues. Unfortunately, all evaporated milk is imported, resulting in a significant financial drain. I sincerely hope that entrepreneurs in our country will rise up and imitate its production.</p>
<p>(2) Condensed milk is 60% milk solids and 40% cane sugar. Infants love its sweetness, and it is particularly suitable for those with weak stomachs.</p>
<p>(3) Milk powder is made by heating fresh milk to 145 degrees, then using high pressure or hot rolling methods to remove impurities and introducing it into a distillation chamber, spraying it into a mist. The water is then absorbed from the warm room. A good product dissolves in water without any sediment, forms a thin film on the surface, and has a rich aroma. It is lightweight and convenient to carry, making it suitable for travel and feeding infants. It is 35% richer in nutrients than fresh milk.</p>
<p>(4) Fresh milk is 7/8 water and 1/8 nutrients. It is suitable for those with weak stomachs to drink.</p>
<h3>Patriotic Harmonica Concert for National Salvation and Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>— Moyi</p>
<p>The China Harmonica Association held its first-anniversary celebration at the Beijing Grand Theater the night before last. Eighty percent of the ticket revenue will be used for disaster relief, and twenty percent will be used for a national salvation fund. The charitable and patriotic gentlemen and ladies of Shanghai filled the entire Beijing Grand Theater before 8 o'clock.</p>
<p>At the opening, the entire group played the Party Song together under the direction of Mr. Wang Qingxun. After listening, we couldn't help but feel immense respect from the bottom of our hearts for the party members who strive for the welfare of the people and defend the country. After the song, Mr. Lin Kanghou delivered the opening speech. He said, "To save the country, we must first save the people. Because saving one more person means leaving one more strength for the country. The reason why the China Harmonica Association is holding its first-anniversary celebration is for this purpose." These are truly heartfelt words.</p>
<p>Once the disaster victims are rescued and have sufficient strength, the people must be encouraged to join the military and contribute to the country, driving the Japanese army rampant in the Northeast out of our territory. Thus, a military song was transmitted to our eardrums under the direction of Mr. Wang Qingxun. Then, Mr. Wang Xiaolai gave a speech. He spoke in Shaoxing dialect, delivering a moving speech. He argued that "people should have proper entertainment. They should not spend their precious money and energy on improper entertainment (such as a mahjong game from last night where a hand worth 300 was not completed). With proper entertainment, people can become stronger. Naturally, there will be no crying when one should be laughing, and no laughing when one should be crying. Therefore, the country will also become prosperous." In this short speech, he had already exposed all the inferior qualities of us Chinese.</p>
<p>This time, the brutal Japanese launched an undeclared war against us. Apart from a few passionate demonstrations by the people, our authorities have only been calm, not resisting, and crying to the League of Nations. This is truly an indelible disgrace. Fortunately, there was General Ma Zhanshan of Heilongjiang, who, with outdated weapons and the weakest army in the Northeast, resisted the Japanese army, defeating the proud Japanese army with sharp weapons, giving us Chinese a chance to breathe. It also shows that we Chinese are not all relying on foreigners and embracing a policy of non-resistance. There are still some courageous soldiers who dare to fight the fierce Japanese army on the battlefield. In admiration of General Ma, Mr. Wang Qingxun renamed Suppe's Ligat Cavaery to "Black Horse Galloping." When playing the low notes, it was like a covert advance, reminding us of the tense scene of General Ma's cavalry attacking the Japanese army in the dark. When playing the high notes, it was like mountains collapsing and the earth cracking, reminding us of the magnificent shouts of the pioneer troops as they charged the Japanese army under the cover of mortars. The audience all felt their spirits lifted. After the performance, Mr. Wang Qingxun made a temporary proposal to ask the audience to generously donate whatever they could, whether copper coins or dimes, and use the money to support General Ma Zhanshan. On the spot, 194.3 yuan in silver dollars, 21 dimes in small silver coins, and 66 copper coins were collected and handed over to Mr. Wang Xiaolai for remittance to the Northeast. From this, it can be seen that the people's hearts have not died, and there is great hope for China's future. Thus, the Eastern music "Destiny" began to play, indicating that China's future destiny is very good. As Napoleon said, "When the sleeping lion awakens, it will shake the world."</p>
<p>At the same time, the final of the Shanghai Harmonica Championship was held. The first place in the women's group was Ms. Zhao Runhan, and the first place in the men's group was Mr. Zeng Keming. Then, Ms. Yu Yixuan's solo singing and Mr. Dai Cuilun's violin solo were both exceptionally pleasant. Then, Mr. Pan Yangyao gave a speech. He said, "When I listen to the sound played by the harmonica team, some seem to be the heroic sound of killing the enemy in Heilongjiang Province, some seem to be the weeping and groaning of compatriots under the iron hooves of the brutal Japanese, some seem to be the tragic cries of passionate people, and some seem to be the miserable cries of disaster victims suffering from hunger and cold." These words are extremely painful, expressing the entire experience of China in the year 20 of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Finally, the Triumphal March was played, wishing the audience success in their careers, General Ma Zhanshan victory, China peace and unification, and the association a limitless future. The audience immediately applauded, as if everything had reached the realm of imagination, and the meeting closed in this enthusiastic celebration of victory.</p>
<p>Short Message Qingyun Bookstore on Simalu recently published a romance novel entitled "Grieving Phoenix Crying Huang." It is written by the famous writer Zhong Jiyu. The content is excellent. The whole book emphasizes friendship, passionate love, sacrifice, and sincerity. It portrays the charm of the love field very thoroughly. The structure and layout are profound and meticulous. The twists and turns of the plot and the strangeness of the facts are comparable to "Tears and Laughter." It is full of sweetness, sourness, bitterness, spiciness, sudden sadness, and sudden joy, and it is particularly touching. If it can be made into a film in the future, it will definitely cause a sensation in society and add a lot of color to the film industry.</p>

<h3>A Country Bumpkin Comes to Shanghai Again (19)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>"I advise you two families to merge into one, you can save some expenses and you can expand the store. It would also be more convenient for us customers to buy things." The country bumpkin sincerely offered his opinion.</p>
<p>The clerk thought, "What does this have to do with him? Why is he so anxious?" So he said,</p>
<p>"These are matters for the owners. We clerks can't control these things." He meant that we clerks can't control it, so what does it have to do with a country bumpkin?</p>
<p>"The clerks naturally help the owners. For example, if they fight, even you will get hit and bleed. What are you fighting for anyway? You clerks have no grudges against each other. They are fighting over business, so they are losing money. Both sides can't pay your salaries. Aren't you clerks unlucky? Even if the store closes, you will also have to worry about losing your jobs. I advise you to give each other a break for the sake of our ancestors." The country bumpkin actually acted as a mediator in the capacity of a third party.</p>
<p>"Even if we merge, we have to make them merge into our place, because we are the main branch. In terms of lineage, we are the orthodox branch." The clerk stood in the store and continued to talk eloquently.</p>
<p>"Ah! The back of the hand is also flesh, and the palm of the hand is also flesh. Since we are one family, there is no need to put up a tofu frame. Just merge together. There is no need to argue about who is first and who is last." The country bumpkin mumbled endlessly.</p>
<p>Just then, their owner came back.</p>
<p>"What are you arguing about?"</p>
<p>"This country bumpkin is telling us to merge the two families. He is being annoying here."</p>
<p>"Ignore him!" The owner glanced at the country bumpkin.</p>
<p>The country bumpkin felt that he had no place to stay. He suddenly remembered: Didn't the ticket seller on the tram say that there was a photo of me across from the Grand Theater? I came to look for my photo. I just happened to see that the two Wen Kui Zhai stores were facing off, so I came to advise them. If they listen, that would be best. If they don't, then forget it. I still have to look for my photo. Is it really here?</p>
<p>The country bumpkin looked around for a long time, but he couldn't find the photo. He suddenly looked up and saw a pair of large turtles painted on their signboard.</p>
<p>"Huh! There is no photo of me, only a pair of big turtles." He recited to himself, and then he suddenly realized. He said, "Tch! I was tricked by this sly, short-lived devil. He is making fun of his father. What photo of me? It's just a big turtle."</p>

<h3>Financial Swap Gold Price Soars</h3>
<p>The swap short side posted three taels. Yesterday's standard gold price fell and rose again, turbulent and surging, advancing and retreating suddenly, the situation was chaotic, but due to the start of the swap, the exchange opened the market half an hour early, at 8:30, but various firms had already traded outside the market with each other before 8:00. The short side still posted, initially at three taels, then increased to three taels, two or three qian, then two taels, five or six qian, according to the listed price of two taels, seven qian, three taels at noon, but the industry's long and short sides were not completely swapped properly. As for November and December, they are usually not traded, but the opening price was 597 taels and 2 qian, and the closing price was 608 taels and a half, an increase of four taels and seven qian compared to last Saturday. This was a transfer according to the January term. Afterwards, the market has cancelled the suspension of listing. Almost the January term has entered the market. Initially, the price fell due to weak investor sentiment, but afterwards, the foreign exchange rate went from loose to tight, and major investors purchased it, and the market sentiment went straight up to the clouds, once breaking through 610 taels. It weakened slightly at noon because of news that Britain had purchased silver bars. The subsequent market exchange rate became stronger, and the buyers exceeded Heng. The Indian exchange rate fell repeatedly, flying Meng Jin, and then rose by ten taels. Afterwards, compared to last weekend (plus a swap of three taels), it rose by more than twenty taels.</p>

Afterwards, sellers suddenly became stronger, and Hengxing, Fuchang, Hengchang Yong, Yuankang, Xiang, and hedging, etc. all sold, and immediately fell downstream by six or seven taels. 11:10 was zero seven taels. In an instant, another high image appeared. Hengxing entered again, and retail investors followed suit, lifting six taels as a result. 11:30 was 13 taels. After entering, news suddenly came that Britain was buying silver, and the market atmosphere was frustrated, sharply reduced by six or seven taels, and Yuancheng Yong, Yuankang Xiang Hengchang Yong, etc. came to sell. At noon, the Indian exchange rate also rose by eight annas, so the closing price was zero five taels and 5 qian, but the buyers increased sharply, remaking zero seven taels and a half to eight taels.

<h3>Currency Market: Apparent Ease, Actual Tightness</h3>
<p>Yesterday, HSBC's listed rates widened by two levels in the morning, then narrowed by one level. This was because the British and American silver markets reported gains the day before, and exchange rates rose. From 9:30 AM, British gold rose by half a penny, to one shilling and eleven pence; the US dollar rose by one yuan, calculated at thirty-six yuan, and the Hong Kong dollar decreased by twenty-five, calculated at seventy-six taels and a half. The rest all rose. By 10:30 AM, they suddenly narrowed by twenty-five, calculated at one shilling and ten pence, and the US dollar by fifty cents, calculated at thirty-five yuan and a half. All other exchange rates, except for the Hong Kong dollar, also narrowed. As for the domestic market, the British and American exchange rates were initially loose and then tight, slightly flat at noon, and increasingly sharp in the afternoon. This was because the gold market recovered from weakness to strength, finally reaching six hundred and seventeen or eighteen taels. However, this great change occurred amidst talk of swapping periods, making it impossible to predict. The result, compared to last Saturday, was that British gold narrowed by half a penny, and the US dollar narrowed by sixty-two and a half cents, truly a situation of apparent ease and actual tightness. Chinese merchants in the gold industry initially sold off and then bought back. In the afternoon, Fuchang and others strongly resisted short selling, probably because Indian exchange rates repeatedly reported declines, indicating that large deals might turn to narrowing. It is estimated that over two hundred thousand pounds of British gold and four or five hundred thousand yuan of US dollars were traded, and the market atmosphere was sharp.</p>
<p>The British exchange rate in the domestic market fluctuated by six and a quarter cents throughout the day. In the morning, the asking price was about one shilling and eleven and a half pence, and the buying price was six and a quarter cents. Soon after, Zhengjin and Huabi made a deal for February at three seventy-five, Huabi bought for January at four thirty-seven five, HSBC bought for December at three seventy-five, and again for January at four thirty-seven five. Huabi bought at three seventy-five, Shanghai offered at twenty-five to one twenty-five, Zhengjin offered for February at eleven pence, and Maihang absorbed at the same price. At this time, the listed rate had already narrowed. At noon, the asking price was zero six two five, and the buying price was one two five. Because news of British purchases of silver was heard, the market situation was slightly firm. In the afternoon, Shanghai and Huabi mutually traded for November at one two five, and Shanghai again offered for December at one two five. After 3:30 PM, Shanghai Dongya offered for February at eleven pence. The closing price was ten pence eight seventy-five, and the buying price was nine thirty-seven five. In summary, the loosest was eleven and a half pence, and the tightest was ten pence eight seventy-five.</p>
<p>The US exchange rate in the domestic market had a one-yuan difference. In the morning, the asking price was thirty-six yuan seventy-five cents, and the buying price was thirty-seven yuan. Huabi bought for March at thirty-six yuan nine three seven five, and offered again at eight seventy-five. (Foreign merchants settled in.) Da Ying and Huabi made a deal for February at eight seventy-five. Later, Shanghai and Maihang mutually traded for January at thirty-six yuan one two five, and Mitsui and Meifeng made a deal for March at thirty-five yuan eight seventy-five. At noon, the asking price was thirty-six yuan one two five, and the buying price was twenty-five. In the afternoon, Yuntong offered for December at one two five, and Citibank bought in. Zhengjin offered for January at thirty-five yuan nine three seven five, and Sumitomo offered for January at six eight seventy-five. The closing price was thirty-five yuan seventy-five to six two five, and the buying price was eight seventy-five to seventy-five. The loosest was thirty-six yuan seventy-five, and the tightest was thirty-five yuan six two five. The initial listed rate for the US dollar was equivalent to two taels seven mace seven fen seven qi per dollar, and was later changed to two taels eight mace one fen six li nine hao, it is said.</p>
<h3>Origin of the Tightening of the Money Market</h3>
<p>Frequent Stock Declines…Significant Impact on the Financial World</p>
<p>Bill Discounting…Necessitates Careful Consideration</p>
<p>Interbank Lending Soars…Even Those with Strong Capital Find Relief Difficult</p>
<p>Market Overview: In recent days, a small number in the financial world have suffered huge losses due to the severe decline in securities, which has inevitably had a great impact on their operations. As a result, many have stalled or run aground, and bill discounting in the market has had to be done with caution, leading to a sudden tightening of the money market. Interbank lending has soared, and even those with strong capital have been unable to provide relief, creating a tense situation in the market.</p>
<p>Interbank Lending Rates: The "Foreign Interest Rate" in the early market was seven mace two fen five li two hao and a half, a sharp increase of one li two hao and a half compared to the previous day's early market. The afternoon market further increased, calculated as seven mace two fen five li three hao seven hu and a half, and the trading situation was also good. The "Silver Interest Rate" was four mace three fen in the early market and four mace five fen in the afternoon market, a sudden surge of one mace compared to the previous day's market price. Furthermore, the "劃頭加水" (literally "adding water to the drawing head," meaning adding extra interest) also rose to four mace five six fen, and even reached above five mace at the highest. The bank's listed rate was one mace seven fen.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Currency Market Conditions: Jiangnan small silver coins were six mace five fen two li in the early market and six mace five fen two li and a half in the afternoon market, a slight increase of half a li compared to the previous day. Transactions were four thousand 角 (jiao, a unit of currency) in the early market and six thousand five hundred 角 in the afternoon market. Guangdong small silver coins were six mace five fen in the early market and six mace five fen zero liu hao two hu and a half in the afternoon market. Transactions were two hundred and forty thousand 角 in the early market and seventy-five thousand 角 in the afternoon market. Copper coins remained at three hundred and eighty thousand cash.</p>
<p>Silver Dollar Inflow and Outflow: The "Silver Interest Rate" saw a slight withdrawal of funds by banks yesterday, so the money market was tighter, and settlements were also frequent. Chinese merchants settled ticket funds of three million three hundred and forty thousand, foreign merchants settled ticket funds of over three million two hundred thousand, special funds settled three to four million, telegraphic transfer funds five to six hundred thousand, and pledge funds were called in for about two million. Various cargo exchange taxes and miscellaneous funds settled ten million five hundred and sixty thousand, warehouse entries were one million seven hundred thousand, money shops and silver public accounts settled over five million one hundred thousand, 劃頭 (drawing head) funds settled over four million eight hundred thousand, and exchange funds from various routes settled over eighty thousand, with over one million settled in cash. "Foreign Funds" - exchange ticket funds made one million five hundred and eighty-five thousand in the early market and one million two hundred and seventy-five thousand in the afternoon market. Banknotes were eleven thousand in the early market and thirty-five thousand in the afternoon market. Off-market banknotes were one hundred and thirty-five thousand in the early market and one hundred and seventy thousand in the afternoon market. Bank transactions - interbank transactions were eight hundred thousand in the early market and nine hundred thousand in the afternoon market. Foreign account transactions between banks settled over one million six hundred thousand, banknote inflow and outflow were two million seven to eight hundred thousand, money shops and foreign public accounts settled over six million two hundred thousand, foreign 劃頭 (drawing head) funds settled over one million eight hundred thousand, interbank lending of foreign funds inflow and outflow were over one million nine hundred thousand, small money shops inflow and outflow of banknote exchange heads were six to seven hundred thousand, and remittance to other places was over thirty thousand.</p>
<h3>Securities and Bond Market: Still Sluggish, Prices Lower</h3>
<p>Public Sentiment Remains Observant, Trend Remains Peaceful</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 16th), the bond market situation at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange saw only 7,000 yuan in spot transactions throughout the day, and the futures market remained sluggish. The sentiment on both the buying and selling sides in both the morning and afternoon markets remained very quiet, and the leisurely situation was the same as last weekend. It is estimated that the morning session had over four million eight hundred thousand in transactions, and the afternoon session had two million one hundred thousand, totaling over six million nine hundred thousand. As for the changes in the prices of various bonds, they also appeared to be quite stable, fluctuating without major ups and downs throughout the day. This was because although the League of Nations Association had set yesterday as the reopening date, its future was still very dark. Whether the current serious situation could be turned around through the meeting was difficult to predict, and the general public's sentiment remained observant as before, with large accounts still rarely entering or exiting. However, because the international situation in recent days has gradually become unfavorable to us, part of the opinions of the great powers are clearly favoring Japan and helping evil. Moreover, Japan is increasingly pursuing its conspiracy for independence and strengthening its military preparations in our eastern provinces, attacking and disturbing without any scruples. The public sentiment in the market has become quite weak, and sporadic sales from all sides are particularly enthusiastic, leading to a continued decline in the market prices of various bonds, all showing a downward trend. Internally, such as the "整六" (Consolidated 6% Loan), "裁兵" (Disbandment Loan), and "二○捲" (1920 Loan) of this month's futures have all fallen by one yuan several 角 (jiao, unit of currency), and others have also fallen by small six or seven 角 each. However, the "關稅" (Customs) 96 futures and the "編遣裁兵" (Reorganization and Disbandment) loan of next month's futures only fell by small two or three 角. Observing the situation of the bond market, the spot market is still extremely depressed, and will depend on the development of the external situation for a shift.</p>

<h3>Yarn, Cotton, and Yarn Market in a Mediocre Situation</h3>
<p>The yarn market is flat and lifeless, with a softening trend. Due to the turbulent times and the increasing aggression of the violent Japanese, public sentiment is weak, and the financial situation is tight, making it difficult for commerce to develop. Actual sales among merchant groups are particularly light, so general retail investors tend to sell short, it is said.</p>
<p>Manbiao [a cotton yarn brand]: Near term firm, far term weak. The exchange's Manbiao market opened with a softening of public sentiment due to falling US cotton prices, and each month fell by 4 cents. In the afternoon, it rose slightly by 1, 2, or 3 cents. The total trading volume for the day was 23,800 bales. It was found that Gengfeng sold 1,400 bales, Yicheng 1,150 bales, Hengde 850 bales, and Shenchang 950 bales. Gongtai bought 1,100 bales, Xingyuan 850 bales, and Xincheng 800 bales. The closing prices are listed on the left.</p>

<p>February 1544 Down 3 77,500</p>
<p>December 1536 Down 1 64,800</p>
<p>March 1548 2 61,150</p>
<p>January 1537 2 75,500</p>
<p>April 1547 2 35,350</p>
<p>Current yarn sales are flat and the market is soft. The statistics show that various merchant groups bought a total of 500 bales throughout the day. 255 bales were transacted among peers. The market trend is softening. Merchant groups imported 270 bales from the interior, 25 bales from the North, 90 bales from Guangdong, 35 bales from Ningbo, and 35 bales from miscellaneous sources, it is said.</p>
<h3>The Main Reason for Cotton Market Recovery</h3>
<p>Many Bulls from Ningbo and Hubei Groups are Buying and Adding Positions</p>
<p>Tight Spot Supply Leads to Tightening of Near-Term Positions</p>
<p>The cotton market situation remains tight. Because many bulls from the Hubei and Ningbo groups are buying and adding positions, the market is firm. However, the conditions for both US and Indian cotton overseas are very weak, and the trend is still downward. Speculators continue to sell, and another 9,000 lots of US cotton were opened, at very cheap prices. The ability of this cotton to rise firmly is due to the lack of spot goods. Very few are being delivered this month, and the bulls are holding tight. The market is stable, but according to the overall trend, it is difficult to see an upward trend.</p>
<p>The Exchange's Hubei cotton rebounded in the afternoon market. The opening price in the morning market was lower due to the trend of falling US cotton, causing public sentiment to soften. Each month fell by 1 cent and 5 fen. In the afternoon, it was heard that gold prices had risen slightly, and the bulls added positions, with each month rebounding by 1 or 2 cents. The total trading volume for the day was 80,000 dan. It was found that Yuanda sold 6,800 dan, Tongyu 1,900 dan, Shenda 1,900 dan, Yilong 1,800 dan, and Gongtai 1,500 dan. Shenchang bought 6,000 dan, Yiyu 3,500 dan, and Xincheng 3,000 dan. The closing prices are listed on the left.</p>

<p>New Special Cotton 30.25 Shenxin bought 1,000 pieces for factory delivery in February-March.</p>
<h3>Weekly Report on Indian and British Cotton Industries</h3>
<p>Mumbai: Last week, due to good forecasts in foreign markets, rising silver prices, and poor Indian cotton harvests, the trend was firm and stable. Although the US cotton government report was favorable to sellers, the market firmed up due to Japanese purchases, and the result was a rebound. Subsequently, the market situation remained strong due to a lack of sellers. In terms of spot goods, it was able to maintain well, and inventory was not thick. New cotton sources were hampered by rain, and it is expected that the spot situation before the end of the year will not be relaxed. Demand for shipments to Europe and China was very active during the week. The attached table shows the statistics for the past week (unit: thousands of bales):</p>
<p>1930 1931</p>
<p>Cumulative Receipts since September 1st 192 112</p>
<p>Weekend Inventory 386 402</p>
<p>Cumulative Exports since September 1st 417 197</p>
<p>Shipments to Europe 100 47</p>
<p>Shipments to China 85 69</p>
<p>Shipments to Japan 228 67</p>
<p>Other Locations 4 14</p>
<p>Liverpool: Spot demand was quite good last week. In the futures market, the US cotton government report did not surprise, despite its large quantity. However, the activity of Lancashire manufacturers and the good news from Manchester caused prices to rise. The Egyptian cotton market situation was even more active due to the firmness of Alexandria.</p>

<h3>Grain Market: River Downstream Rice Market Turns Loose After Sunny Weather</h3>
<p>Yesterday, more than thirty boats from various gangs came to Nantou, and the amount in storage at the docks gradually increased. Although the shops in the city and countryside are past the accounting period, they remain sluggish, mainly due to the pressure of tight money. Transactions were similar to yesterday. The price of thick Xin Geng rice recovered slightly by a few jiao (unit of currency), and the thin early and late rice had some sales. This street remained sluggish, the Ningbo appetite was also small, and the price was cut by another two jiao. The changing yuan and yangdujian rice accumulated without weakening, transactions were light and loose, and the price was weak by more than one jiao.</p>
<p>Yesterday, thirty-eight or nine boats arrived in Xinzha from the west, with abundant supplies at the river. The market was quiet, and public sentiment was calm. The top goods from Xixin fell by one jiao, and the goods from Zhongguan also shortened by two jiao. It is still difficult to stand firm. There were very few transactions of kiln-grown early rice in the morning. Although the supply was short, the price was soft by one and a half jiao. The changing yuan liquor workshops still had strong demand, with fluctuations of over one jiao at the opening. The appetite for yangdujian rice was scarce, a downstream phenomenon.</p>
<h3>Spot Foreign Rice: Still Good Appetite on This Street</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the situation of the foreign rice market initially showed weakness, but later, because this street still had good intake, the market remained stable, and transactions were more active than last week. It is estimated that 2,500 bags of spot small絞 (small grain rice) were opened, priced at ten yuan and two jiao, ten yuan and one jiao and a half, and then down to ten yuan. 300 bags of Saigon No. 1 were priced at eleven yuan and five jiao seven fen, and 200 bags of Min Dang were priced at ten yuan and seven jiao seven fen. Foreign futures firms continued to sell, and the market shape was still soft. Yesterday, 500 tons of new transactions were purchased by this street, small 絞 (small grain rice) for April, the price was still four taels and nine qian, it is said.</p>
<h3>Flour Market: Fell in the Morning, Recovered in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the flour market, after the opening in the morning, the market for each month saw a huge decline again. Because foreign wheat quotations still fell by six or seven jiao, and the gold market was also shaky, public sentiment was unusually uneasy. The initial opening price for this month was as low as one tael nine qian two fen and a half, December was one tael nine qian four fen and a half, January was one tael nine qian seven fen, February was one tael nine qian seven li and a half, March was two taels zero one fen seven li and a half, and April was two taels zero two fen and a half, a drop of one to two fen compared to the previous week's closing price. However, in later sessions, those short covering due to procrastination, and the north and south ocean sales groups, whether near or far, all absorbed. It was generally believed that this market value was already cheap, so they entered enthusiastically. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, the market atmosphere was still expensive because the customers still had an appetite. It was heard that the various ports of Tianjin, because they were about to close the river and the inventory was exhausted, had a strong intention to enter, so public sentiment was strongly firm. As a result, this month and December rebounded by one fen and seven li and a half compared to the previous week, January rose by two fen and seven li and a half, February rose by two and a half fen, March rose by two fen and seven li and a half, and April rose by three fen, it is said.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures: Weak and Then Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the wheat futures market, after the opening in the morning and afternoon, the market for each month showed a phenomenon of initial weakness followed by stability. This was because foreign wheat quotations still fell by six or seven jiao (it was rumored that the price of wheat abroad had fallen sharply again, because there had been timely rainfall and the wheat production could still be abundant) and because the exchange rate could not be significantly narrowed, so most people's hearts were ultimately weak. Later, due to smooth short covering, and because of the recovery of the flour market, public sentiment turned excited again. However, it was finally reported that the western foreign wheat could have a fixed price, and the price was only three taels and nine qian. In this situation, it seems that the factory is active again, so although the environment for flour has improved, wheat has seen problems again. As a result, this month improved by two fen, December improved by two fen, January did not move, and February, March, and April improved by two fen.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Xinghua’s Authentic Second-Grade Ground Price Turns Down</h3>
<p>This year, the ground price of Xinghua's authentic second-grade longan is exorbitantly high due to a significant production shortage, far exceeding the norm. For example, the standard Jiechun authentic second-grade opened at ninety-nine taels, and it was still difficult to break even. However, the sales volume is inevitably reduced due to the excessively high selling price. Because the ground price has already loosened, the Shanghai market has also fallen accordingly. Now, the standard Jiechun brand authentic second-grade has already opened at a two-tael decrease, and each of the sub-brands and miscellaneous brands has also retreated accordingly. Sales remain sluggish in recent days, and the market may have to continue to soften.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: European and American Silk Sales Still Show No Improvement</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the local foreign merchant silk market, there was still no improvement. After investigating, the silk market in Lyon and London still had not shifted via telegram, so European sales cannot be expected to be active for the time being. Although Ganli and others had B-grade factory silk intake, the average price of 83 fen was only 856 taels, and the gray warp was only 334 taels. Chinese silk merchants all believe they are losing money, so the transaction is pending. Yesterday, only Xintai bought ten packs of Bai Chang warp on behalf of Huzhou silk merchants, Samsung bought five packs of Xiao Che Huang Chang warp, and Dachang bought ten packs of Bai Qian warp, and the prices were stable, it is said.</p>
<h3>Ping Shui Aged Tea: European Sales are Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the local foreign merchant tea market, Huzhou Ping Shui pearl tea, the British Zhuang Yihé, Tongfu, Xiehe, and other firms, all had intake, and the city sold more than 700 boxes. Among them, the top-grade pearl tea was priced at 98-99 taels, two to three taels lower than before. The Ping Shui green tea market has not yet fallen significantly. However, the Luzhuang tea market is still quiet. There were no transactions of Zhenmei and Gongxi, and the tea price has dropped by twenty or thirty taels. The future is quite pessimistic, it is said.</p>
<h3>Coal: White Coal Transactions are Most Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the weather cleared up, and various types of white coal were the most actively traded in the market. The city opened with transactions of about 800 tons. It is estimated that 205 tons of Liujiang white coal fragrant goods were priced at sixteen taels and a half, and 53 tons of stinky goods were priced at twelve taels and a half. 136 tons of Shanxi white coal were priced at nineteen taels two qian and a half, 97 tons of Hongqi white coal were priced at 22 taels, 150 tons of Mark white coal were priced at 23 taels, 143 tons of Special Great Wall white coal were priced at seventeen taels two qian and a half, and 84 tons of No. 1 Great Wall white coal were priced at eleven taels five qian, it is said.</p>

<h3>The Rise of All Circles to Help the Black Army</h3>
<p>The Municipal Party Department Appeals for Aid for the Black Army, Telegrammed Commanders Chiang and Zhang Yesterday, and Remitted 2,000 Yuan as Consolation</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Party Department, considering Chairman Ma Dai of Heilongjiang Province's isolated army resisting Japan, a model of loyalty and bravery, decided yesterday in a meeting to economize 2,000 yuan from the office expenses and telegraph it to Qiqihar as a token of consolation. Meanwhile, it is also widely soliciting donations from leaders from all walks of life. Furthermore, the Shanghai various circles celebrating the Premier's birthday and the opening anniversary of the Fourth Plenary Session of the National Congress decided to telegraph General Commander Chiang and Deputy Commander Zhang, requesting them to send troops to aid Heilongjiang. After the presidium of the conference accepted it, it was sent to the executive committee for handling. It is now learned that the conference has already sent a telegram requesting assistance. The original text is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>To Commanders Chiang and Zhang, Respectfully to Comrade Chiang Kai-shek, General Commander in Nanjing, and Comrade Zhang Hanqing, Deputy General Commander in Beiping: Recently approved a report from Hu Shuhua and six others of the presidium of the Municipal Various Circles Celebrating the Premier's Birthday and the Opening Anniversary of the Fourth National Congress, stating that the conference resolved to request the telegraphing of General Commander Chiang and Deputy Commander Zhang to dispatch troops to aid Heilongjiang promptly. Upon investigation, Ma Zhanshan, the acting chairman of Heilongjiang Province, is resisting the violent Japanese and defending the frontier. His isolated army is fighting bravely and loyally, which is admirable. The news of his victory is deeply inspiring. However, considering the masses in a poor and barren corner resisting fierce and skilled bandits, the soldiers are few and the supplies are scarce, and mistakes are feared. At this critical juncture, the General Commander and Deputy Commander should immediately dispatch reinforcements to boost morale. The violent Japanese have already occupied Liaoning and Jilin and are now eyeing Heilongjiang. They are advancing step by step and acting recklessly. Our country's resistance is not only a factual necessity but also praised by justice. In addition to separate telegrams to General Chiang and Deputy Commander Zhang, this is an urgent telegram, requesting you to quickly gather elite troops and send them out to support the frontier, so as to protect the border and recover lost territory. We eagerly await your response. Respectfully, the Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang Shanghai Special Municipality.</p>
<p>To the Black Army, Respectfully to Chairman Ma Dai and All Anti-Japanese Soldiers of Qiqihar: The violent Japanese disregard justice, dispatching troops to the Northeast, having occupied Liaoning and Jilin, and advancing into Heilongjiang, causing heartbreak throughout the country and laughter around the world. Fortunately, our generals and soldiers in Heilongjiang Province refuse to surrender and are bravely fighting against Japan. The isolated army is holding up the sky, fighting for the country's dignity and seeking a way out for the nation. Their righteousness reaches the clouds, and their loyalty moves the gods. Hearing of this from afar, we are deeply inspired. In addition to coordinating with various circles in this city to raise funds and continuously send encouragement, we are also economizing 2,000 yuan, telegraphing it to your esteemed office to comfort your hard work. We hope that you will continue to fight bravely and resolutely kill the enemy. The compatriots in this city are willing to be your rear guard. We are moved to tears as we send this telegram, filled with hope. Respectfully, the Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang Shanghai Special Municipality.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Responds to Wang Yansong</h3>
<p>The Funds for Rewarding the Ma Army Are Still Being Raised, Please Sincerely Urge the Central Government to Send Troops to Aid</p>
<p>Wang Yansong, a representative of this city attending the Fourth National Congress, telegraphed the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Silver Money Guild, and various trade associations from Beijing the day before yesterday, stating: "General Ma Zhanshan has been fighting alone for more than ten days, defending the country, fighting on the border, and urgently awaiting assistance. It is heard that the Chamber of Commerce has remitted 10,000 yuan and must still be raising funds. The Chamber of Commerce and the Silver Money Guild should promptly raise 1 million yuan and telegraph it to Heilongjiang Province to reward the army. Yansong, personally, is willing to raise 5,000 yuan to hand over to the Chamber of Commerce for remittance. Please, gentlemen, leaders of the business community, rise up and promote this. If we still watch from the sidelines and remain indifferent at this moment, the country will be destroyed and the family broken, and there will be no time for us to redeem ourselves. I am saddened and eager to send this telegram." The Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed back yesterday, saying: "Respectfully to Mr. Wang Yansong, Central Hotel, Nanjing: We have received your telegram. Shanghai merchants have successively collected funds, amounting to nearly 50,000, which has been sent out first and is still being raised, without a fixed amount. However, the Japanese are greatly increasing their reinforcements. Today there is also news from Harbin. Unless the central government quickly sends a large army to provide substantial assistance, I am afraid it will eventually be unsustainable. Please sincerely urge the central government nearby. Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce."</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Municipal Trade Unions Telegraphed Request for Mobilization</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Trade Unions Telegraphed to the National Government Urgently: "Respectfully to the National Government in Nanjing: The violent Japanese are resisting the League of Nations' resolution to withdraw troops before November 16 and are increasing their troops and invading our land. Their ambitions are increasingly unstoppable. If our country continues to endure humiliation and bear the burden, it will leave behind troubles that are difficult to resolve. The government's responsibility lies in mobilizing the whole country immediately, consolidating the army, denouncing the enemy, driving out the Japanese pirates, and recovering the occupied areas. The opportunity is critical, so a quick plan is needed. More than 800,000 workers in Shanghai are vowed to be the rearguard. The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union, the Postal Workers' Union, the Publishing Industry Union, the First District Water and Electricity Industry Union, the Seventh District Cotton Textile Industry Union, the Fourth District Cigarette Industry Union, the Fifth District Cigarette Industry Union, etc., lead the more than 800,000 workers in the city to salute."</p>
<h3>Various Groups Telegraph to Comfort Ma Zhanshan</h3>
<p>(1) The Eighth District Party Department telegraphed: "Respectfully to General Ma Zhanshan, Chairman of the Heilongjiang Provincial Government, and All Soldiers: The Japanese invaders have entered our land, and Liaoning and Jilin have fallen. Our General Ma Zhanshan and all the soldiers of our Heilongjiang Army are loyal, brave, and insightful, and are able to resist the fierce enemy despite the cries of no resistance. Under the calm environment, they have repeatedly frustrated the stubborn enemy. The isolated army is fighting hard to protect our territory and to eliminate the brutal soldiers, speaking up for the people. They are the pillars of the party and the state and the barrier of the Northeast. They have won supreme glory for China and washed away the unprecedented shame for the nation. Their loyalty to the country is admirable. We look to the north with admiration. We hope to continue our efforts to achieve the final victory, to maintain the history of the country, and to promote justice for the world. Special telegram of condolence, I hope you will understand. The Eighth District Party Department of the Chinese Kuomintang Shanghai Special Municipality salutes." (2) The Zhirenyong Girls' High School telegraphed: "To Chairman Ma of the Heilongjiang Provincial Government in Qiqihar: The violent Japanese are invading, and the country is on the verge of destruction. We rely entirely on your loyalty and bravery to kill the enemy and protect the country. This person and this achievement will be recorded in history forever. All teachers and students in our school initiated assistance for the military and vowed to be the rearguard. We send this telegram of condolence. All Teachers and Students of Shanghai Zhirenyong Girls' High School." (3) The Seventh Branch of the Municipal Federation telegraphed: "To Chairman Ma of Heilongjiang Province: You are faithfully performing your duties, being loyal to the battlefield, making continuous efforts, resisting the Japanese army, and repeatedly hearing good news. The people are celebrating. You are upholding the personality of the Chinese people and speaking up for the nation. You will be remembered for thousands of years and add glory to history. With the spirit of great fearlessness and the loyalty of iron and blood, you should quickly gather a large army to complete the territory. The merit lies in the party and the country, and the chairman is the one to figure this out. In addition to telegraphing the National Government to send reinforcements quickly, our association has also telegraphed condolence and is raising funds to help. When the country is in trouble, it is hoped that you will be encouraged to inspire the elite and drive out the violent Japanese. We eagerly look forward to and pray." (4) The Ninth Branch of the Municipal Federation telegraphed: "To Chairman Ma of Heilongjiang: The violent Japanese are approaching endlessly, and Heilongjiang Province has been invaded. Fortunately, our army is vowing to resist the enemy and repelling the Japanese army again and again, with the determination to hold the city firmly and the enthusiasm to loyally kill the enemy. Good news has spread, and the whole country is celebrating. The chairman has the indomitable and courageous spirit to eliminate the fierce flames and eradicate the Japanese pirates. The critical moment is now. We hope that you will work hard to fight and persevere to the end. The survival of the country and the livelihood of the people depend on it. We hereby send this telegram of condolence. The future is carefully planned for. The Eighth and Ninth Branches of the Shanghai Citizens' United Association salutes." (5) The Twenty-sixth Branch of the Municipal Federation telegraphed: "To Chairman Ma of Heilongjiang Province: The violent Japanese are rampant and are taking an inch and wanting a mile. Liaoning and Jilin have been occupied, and Heilongjiang Province has been taken. Fortunately, our chairman is commanding properly, and the morale is loyal and brave. We have repeatedly resisted the enemy and repelled the Japanese army. The righteousness of protecting the country will be passed down for generations and speak up for the country, making contributions to the party and the country. In addition to telegraphing the Commanders-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force to request mobilization to aid Heilongjiang, our association has automatically organized a volunteer army and is making every effort to appeal. We ask the rich to donate to prepare for the proper use of saving the country and to strengthen the rear defense. We deeply hope that you will drive out the enemy and persevere to the end. The citizens of this district are willing to be the rearguard. We specially send this telegram of condolence and hope that you will work hard to fight. The Twenty-sixth Branch of the Shanghai Citizens' United Association salutes." (6) The Southern Fujian Fellow Association telegraphed: "The Southern Fujian Overseas Shanghai Association telegraphed the highest party, political, and military organs in Nanjing and Beiping yesterday, requesting assistance for Heilongjiang, saying: "Respectfully to the National Congress of Nanjing, the National Government, General Commander Chiang, and Deputy Commander Zhang in Beiping: Our country has been intimidated by accumulated power and fears Japan like a tiger. Now, Chairman Ma is using the strength of Heilongjiang Province to resist the army of the violent Japanese country. He is still able to chop off generals and capture flags, chasing the fleeing enemy. It is solid for our army to be straight and strong, and the enemy's army to be crooked and old. However, the paper tiger of the East is not enough to be afraid of, and it has been exposed to the world. However, it is common sense that the few cannot defeat the many. If the isolated army is allowed to fight hard, how can we reward the loyal officials? If Heilongjiang Province is unfortunately lost again, Shandong and Henan will be next, and Jiangsu, Hubei, Zhejiang, and Fujian will be defeated one by one, until the whole country is enslaved. Therefore, assisting Heilongjiang is to save the country, and abandoning Heilongjiang is tantamount to selling the country. We urge you to quickly send elite reinforcements to provide sufficient salaries and weapons. Please do not destroy the Great Wall of Ten Thousand Miles, which would be painful for loved ones and pleasing for enemies. We are anxiously awaiting orders in alarm. The Southern Fujian Overseas Shanghai Association salutes.""</p>
<h3>The Latest News on Resisting Japan and Saving the Country</h3>
<p>Submitted to the Municipal Party Department to Order Oaths Not to Buy Japanese Goods</p>
<p>The Anti-Japanese Association received a letter from the Wuhan Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, requesting that the Wuhan method be followed to instruct all subordinate groups, etc., to swear not to buy Japanese goods. The Municipal Party Department submitted the following document yesterday, saying: "The case is a petition, and the letter from the Wuhan Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association states, "At present, when the country is in trouble, people from all walks of life should put public before private and work together to save the country. An economic boycott against Japan is the only good way for the people to save the country. (Omission) It is hoped, therefore, that the Wuhan various organizations, schools, groups, etc., will swear not to buy Japanese goods. How can our Shanghai, a large commercial port, be willing to lag behind? The matter concerns the main purpose of saving the country, and we should agree to it. In accordance with the letter, we should prepare a document and submit it to the Executive Committee of the Shanghai Special Municipality Party Department, asking you to examine and approve it, and allow it to be transferred to various agencies, schools, and groups, etc., to follow it uniformly, which is convenient for the public."</p>
<p>Strict Letter Warning Bao Sheng Qian Zhuang for Privately Exchanging Japanese Currency</p>
<p>The Anti-Japanese Association issued a special letter of warning to Bao Sheng Zhuang regarding the private exchange of Japanese currency, saying: "Respectfully, it is reported that Bao Sheng Zhuang in Miller Road is privately trading with Japanese merchants and sending partners to the Bank of Korea to exchange Japanese currency. The colleagues have detected the evidence and seized the witnesses. However, the Zhuang is still evasive and unrepentant. Please give him a severe punishment, etc. In accordance with this, the Qian Dui Industry Tongyi Association has long declared an economic boycott against Japan and will not buy Japanese currency. The penalty rules are there. The country is still in trouble, and the Zhuang is openly sending partners to exchange enemy currency. What about credibility? What about conscience? In view of the previous situation, we should first issue a strict letter of warning. If you trade with Japanese merchants again, you will be sanctioned upon detection. Please be careful to follow this order."</p>
<p>Letter to the Match Industry: Yang Wood Produced in Henan Can Be Made into Rod Slices</p>
<p>The Anti-Japanese Association sent a letter to various match companies yesterday, saying: "Respectfully, according to a letter of suggestion from Mr. Qiu Kaizhen, matches are sold to poor rural areas. The people of the country use them every day. If we print national salvation propaganda words on the matchbox surface, users will remember them every time. Compared with any propaganda, the effect is greater. In addition, the Japanese match rods and foreign Yang wood used to make stem slices by various match factories in China should be exempted uniformly. It is now found that the Yang wood produced in Henan Province in our country is sufficient to be used as raw material for self-made stem slices. In accordance with this, resisting foreign goods and promoting domestic goods is the fundamental way to save the country through industry. Since our country has Yang wood produced in Henan, which can be used to make stem slices, we should adopt it uniformly. Printing national salvation words on the matchbox surface is also a timely and important plan, which is beneficial and inexpensive. We should send letters to various match companies to adopt them uniformly, so as to block the leak and awaken the people of the country."</p>
<p>Letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce: Do Not Raise the Price of Domestic Raw Materials</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce issued a letter to various trade associations in the city yesterday, stating: "On the 13th of this month, the letter from the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association stated, "The letter from the Beijing Anti-Japanese Association states, "The Japanese pirates are rampant. Taking advantage of our soldiers and disasters, they sent troops to the eastern provinces and occupied Liaoning and Jilin. All our people are outraged. If we don't destroy these guys, how can we survive? At present, in order to resist the enemy and save the country, everyone believes that boycotting Japanese goods and promoting domestic goods are the most important tasks at present. Therefore, this association has issued a declaration to advise various shops in Beijing and Tianjin not to increase the value of domestic goods during the period of boycotting Japanese goods. According to letters from various trade associations, the raw materials and goods of domestic goods in Tianjin and Shanghai have increased in value, which has greatly affected Beijing and Tianjin and made it difficult to maintain business." The noble association is requested to inform the various shops in your area of the purpose of the people's national salvation and maintain the original prices of domestic goods to show their promotion and consolidate the national foundation." In accordance with this, increasing the price of domestic raw materials during the anti-Japanese movement will greatly affect the future of domestic goods. We should prepare a letter and forward it, and ask your noble association to check and forward it to various shops to follow it in order to maintain domestic goods. In accordance with this, at the time of boycotting Japanese goods, it is a good opportunity to promote domestic goods. Do not raise prices because of this. Our association has issued a circular to advise you. Now, in accordance with the previous reason, we should record the letter again and notify you, and ask the relevant trade associations to inform their members to follow it."</p>
<p>Letter to Various Industries: Use Eye-Catching Titles for Various Goods</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to more than ten trade associations, including the Western Clothing Industry Association, the Seafood Miscellaneous Goods Industry Association, the Western Paint Industry Association, the Yarn Industry, the Paper Industry, the Cotton Cloth Industry, the General Miscellaneous Goods Industry, the Sugar Industry, the Iron Industry, the Hardware Industry, the Water and Electricity Materials Industry, the Mercerized Cotton Weaving Industry, the Woolen Fabric Industry, the Knitting Industry, and the Pickled Meat Industry, stating: "Respectfully, the letter from the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association states, "According to a suggestion from citizen Li Yongfu, there is a method that can help promote domestic goods and resist foreign goods. That is, various shops in Shanghai, such as those selling foreign goods, southern goods, and foreign paper, should classify the goods they sell and use eye-catching titles to indicate the country of origin. They should also print a case and hang it in front of the door for customers to consult and purchase at will. This method has several benefits." In accordance with this, if various industries can implement it, it will not only achieve special effects in resisting Japanese goods, but also greatly help in promoting domestic goods. For this reason, we enclose the original letter and send it to your noble association for review and implementation, and we hope that you will forward it to the various industries, so that buyers can easily identify the names of the goods in stock and the names of the manufacturing countries, etc. In addition, a form is enclosed." In accordance with this, this time, the violent Japanese are rampant, and the whole country is angry. We have the determination to resist Japanese goods, but who are Japanese goods and who are not Japanese goods? Ordinary buyers are struggling to identify them, which is a major obstacle to resisting goods. The association advocates that various shops classify the goods they sell and use eye-catching titles to display them in front of the stores. If it can be implemented, the effect will be great. We should record the letter urgently, print the form and enclose it, and send it together with a letter. We hope that you will check and forward it to the member stores to follow it."</p>
<p>The Seventh District Branch of the Municipal Federation Inspects Japanese Goods: The Seventh District Branch of the Municipal Federation of Citizens, led by Liu Zhongying, Zhou Fuzhang, Chen Ruijin, Zhou Lexiang, Yan Zuqing, Fan Tianjin, Jiang Jianpei, etc., went to the East Broadway Road area yesterday morning to check each household.

It is heard that the team will go to the Yangshupu area tomorrow to check each household in order to clear it.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Disposes of Sealed Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>│The Western Clothing Industry Association Expressed Opposition│</p>
<p>The People of the Country Bear the Pain to Seal Them, How Can They Be Unsealed and Sold?</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Western Clothing Industry Association sent a letter to the Committee for Implementing Economic Boycott Against Japan of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, stating: "Respectfully, on the 12th of this month, we received a letter from your association regarding the disposal of sealed Japanese goods. Yesterday, the 24th Executive Committee of the Association discussed it and signed it with the resolution of your association, which is a comprehensive consideration of resisting Japan and helping merchants. However, the so-called giving certificates and selling them is not appropriate. When the violent Japanese invaded the Northeast and massacred our compatriots, the people of the country sought the survival of the nation and the preservation of the rivers and mountains, and then there was the act of implementing economic boycott against Japan. For several months, the people of the country have borne the pain to seal the enemy goods, hoping to persevere to the end, so that the dwarfs on the three islands will die without fighting. Unexpectedly, the lost land in the Northeast has not been recovered, the blood stains of our compatriots have not dried, and the glue on the sealed enemy goods has not yet dried. The gentlemen of your association have heard about unsealing and selling enemy goods. I don't know what is the intention. Or is it the good intention of taking care of the merchants' capital? However, can the gentlemen of your honorable office guarantee that the secret private entry of unscrupulous merchants is not inevitable? Or what method is there to improve it? The members of the Association are not good, and they dare to send a letter for guidance so that they can follow it."</p>
<h3>End of Preparations for Nisshin Kisen Kaisha's Closure</h3>
<p>From Now On, No More Japanese Ships on the Yangtze River</p>
<p>The nationwide boycott of Japanese goods, implemented consistently, has placed Japanese businesses in Shanghai in an unsustainable position. Japanese shipping companies in China have been particularly hard hit. The Shanghai branch of Nisshin Kisen Kaisha (Nisshin Steamship Company), since the boycott began, has had no cargo or passengers for over two months, virtually no business at all. When all ships were operating, monthly expenses amounted to 300,000 yuan. Last month, the company had already suspended two-thirds of its ships. Now, with the anti-Japanese sentiment growing fiercer and the prospects for business hopeless, the company has held meetings for days. It fears that the boycott will not subside within a year or two. With ships constantly sailing empty, the hidden losses would be endless. Therefore, the company decided to liquidate its shipping business in China. Yesterday, when the reporter met with a person in charge of the company and asked about the situation, they provided detailed information about the preparations for the closure. The following is a summary:</p>
<p>Ships Already Suspended</p>
<p>The company's main business was the Yangtze River shipping, with ships operating both upstream and downstream. Annual turnover was about 100 to 4 million yuan. Since the boycott began, in mid-last month, the Shanghai-Yichang and Yichang-Chongqing routes were first suspended. Then, four more Yangtze River ships were removed, leaving only four ships in operation. There are no longer ships operating upstream. Even on the Shanghai-Hankou route, there is no business. The remaining ships often sail empty.</p>
<p>Japanese Returning Home</p>
<p>The company has wharves, hulks, warehouses, and branches in various ports from Shanghai, such as Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Wuhu, Jiujiang, Hankou, Yichang, Shashi, Chongqing, Changsha, etc. Starting this month, all Japanese employees who were hired have been dismissed and ordered to return to their home countries with their families. Wharves, hulks, warehouses, and branches above Hankou are being closed down one after another. Recently, all Japanese employees in various departments of the Shanghai headquarters have been dismissed and sent back to their home countries. Only the president remains in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Ocean Liners Cease Operations</p>
<p>Since last month, the company has laid off over two thousand Chinese workers on land and water. Recent meetings have been held repeatedly, considering that the company's business has mainly relied on transporting Japanese goods, which has now completely stopped. The five ocean liners on the North and South routes have seen a sharper decline in business since the Tianjin Incident. Therefore, the Baling Maru's Shanghai-Tianjin route has already been abolished. Regarding the Songshan, Lushan, Huashan, and Tangshan ships, according to a person in charge of the company yesterday, it has been decided that they will also cease operations within a few days.</p>
<p>Handling the Liquidation</p>
<p>The Chinese management has been handling the liquidation for some time, so the company's entire business has, in fact, already stopped seventy or eighty percent. The Shanghai president has telegraphed the Tokyo headquarters to discuss the aftermath. It is reported that the headquarters has decided to order the Shanghai branch to expedite the liquidation process to reduce losses. The suspension of North and South ocean routes will likely be decided at today's meeting. After the routes are suspended, the branch wharves and warehouses in Tianjin, Shantou, Xiamen, Guangzhou, Qingdao, and other ports will also be closed and dissolved. Finally, the four remaining Yangtze River ships will be suspended, marking the total end of all business operations. This process has already begun.</p>
<p>Yangtze River Ship Accident</p>
<p>The company's Yangtze River ship, Ruiyang Maru, was traveling from Shanghai to Hankou this time when it encountered heavy fog upstream of Tongzhou. Due to the obscured navigation, the ship could not proceed and attempted to anchor, but mistakenly entered shallow waters. The ship's hull was grounded on a reef, and the vessel could not move. Urgent telegrams were sent for help. The company dispatched the Xiangyang Maru to rescue and transfer the cargo and passengers to Hankou first. Yesterday, the small steamer Baihao was also dispatched to tow the ship.</p>
<h3>Temporary Suspension of Coal Freight Increase</h3>
<p>Temporary Suspension of Price Increase for Three Months from November 1st</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Ministry of Industry issued an order to Yu Qiaqing and Wang Xiaolai, stating, "For the information of the magistrates, regarding the previous petition to request the Ministry of Railways to instruct various routes to increase carriages and reduce fees to facilitate transportation and avoid coal shortages, etc., this Ministry has consulted the Ministry of Railways for verification and handling, and has approved it in writing. It is heard that regarding the reduction of fees, the Ministry of Railways has approved the letter, and has ordered representatives of various coal merchants to negotiate various items, and the method of temporarily suspending the increase in coal freight prices. All freight increases since May 1st of this year will be temporarily suspended for three months from November 1st." This order is hereby issued for information.</p>
<h3>Hu Hanmin Issues Statement</h3>
<p>Sends Letter to Ahan Daily to Replace Inscription</p>
<p>Since the Peace Conference decided that both the Nanjing and Guangdong sides would each hold the Fourth National Congress, the attitude of various parties towards Mr. Hu Zhantang has attracted great attention. Yesterday, the reporter specifically called on Mr. Hu to inquire about everything. According to him, "My views on the current situation have been made public many times. I advocate that political, party affairs, and military affairs must be thoroughly reformed to achieve genuine peace and unification for the country. In diplomacy with Japan, the focus should be on recovering territory by a specific date and making preparations for any eventuality with the greatest determination to safeguard the country's survival. General Ma Zhanshan's ability to shield the Heilongjiang Province with a lone army is truly admirable. The government authorities should promptly provide assistance to strengthen support. In the past, the authorities have only stated that they rely on the League of Nations and trust the League of Nations. There is nothing else that is called diplomacy. Recently, I heard that the Japanese intend to propose joint management of China to the League of Nations. Although this proposal is absurd, I deeply believe that the League of Nations, which has always been committed to upholding justice and safeguarding peace, will not be deceived and will definitely find a way to implement its demand for the withdrawal of Japanese troops to ensure its credibility. However, if, unfortunately, the League of Nations cannot take effective measures immediately, I don't know if we will let it drag on and continue to rely on it and trust it. In my opinion, as an independent country, it should never fail to resolve all issues within the realm of possibility and rely on begging a third party for help, or even close its eyes and do nothing. This is self-deception for individuals, and the national dignity is completely damaged for the country. If the authorities do not wake up and continue to use the three 'no' policies of no plan, no responsibility, and no resistance as the only way to deal with Japan, then the country will perish and the race will become extinct. This is what the people of the country should pay close attention to." Mr. Hu continued, "My views on the current situation are based on the telegram I issued last month, and they are firm and unwavering. As a party member, I cannot abandon the party's doctrines and policies. As a citizen, I cannot sit idly by and watch the entire country be sacrificed for the sake of a few individuals' power. Today, if the Kuomintang wants to continue its life, and if the country wants to guarantee its survival, it must make substantial reforms in internal affairs. However, I have heard that some people outside have been falsely promoting my views and doing the opposite of what I advocate. They do not hesitate to reverse right and wrong to confuse people and aim to discredit me personally. I have touched on these ridiculous tricks in my previous statements. I believe that a revolutionary's views and attitude should be open and honest, subject to the criticism of the people of the world. It is impossible to flatter or pander to the world and damage the personality of a revolutionary. I have followed the Premier for decades, and the time spent in exile and failure accounts for almost half of it. I have always acted according to this principle and have never changed. Therefore, people often think that I do not want the masses, do not want organization, and act as if I am walking in the air without a base. In fact, only the party should have the masses and their organization. If I seek personal gain and use extremely despicable means to use the masses and engage in organization as my own background, even ordinary politicians would not bother to do so, let alone those who take on the role of revolutionaries."</p>
<p>Also, recently, a newspaper called Ahan Daily has appeared in this city, specializing in current affairs commentary. The inscription on the newspaper's masthead was written by Mr. Hu Zhantang. The reporter made a special visit to Mr. Hu to inquire about it. During the conversation, his secretary, Wang Yangchong, handed over a letter from Mr. Hu to Ahan Daily, instructing it to be published. Mr. Hu also said, "In the past, I liked to write very much. If comrades asked for it, I would always agree as long as time and energy allowed. However, I have never attacked people. There are many people who falsely use my name to promote their views, and there are also people outside who conspire to discredit me personally. This is very ridiculous." Now, Mr. Hu's original letter is recorded as follows: "To the Ahan Daily: A few days ago, someone asked me to write the four characters for Ahan Daily, believing that it was related to Buddhist terms and would not involve current affairs, so I readily wrote them. Now I see that it is published and mostly discusses political issues, which is far from what I expected. Recently, I have heard that there are many people outside who falsely use my name to promote their views, and there are also people who conspire to discredit me personally. Your newspaper's intention may not be this, but it is enough to cause people to doubt. Please immediately replace the inscription I wrote and publish this letter to clarify the truth. Sincerely, Hu Hanmin."</p>
<h3>Wang Jingwei Telegraphed Request to Extradite Du Xuantai Back to Guangdong</h3>
<p>To be Severely Punished by the Special Court According to Law</p>
<p>Du Xuantai, the main instigator of the Guangzhou Massacre, has been arrested in Hankou. Wang Jingwei, the representative of Guangdong stationed in Shanghai, telegraphed Cai Yuanpei, Zhang Ji, and Chen Mingshu, representatives in Beijing, yesterday, requesting them to find a way to extradite Du back to Guangdong to be severely punished according to law. The original telegram reads, "To Cai Jiemin, Zhang Puquan, and Chen Zhenru in Nanjing: I have just received a telegram from Xiang Hanping, Director of the Public Security Bureau of Guangdong Province, stating that Du Xuantai has been arrested in Hankou and requesting that the suspect be extradited back to Guangdong for legal punishment. Du Xuantai refused to obey the orders of Chen Qingyun, Director of the Public Security Bureau, on October 10th and 11th, and recklessly opened fire on the public. Then, he colluded with police officers of the Public Security Bureau and escaped privately, treating people's lives and national law as a child's play, which is extremely infuriating. Fortunately, the authorities in Hankou were able to cooperate in arresting the wanted criminal, preventing him from escaping. We are truly grateful for this public service. We respectfully request that the three gentlemen find a way to extradite this criminal back to Guangdong so that the special court established specifically for the massacre can fully punish him according to law. I believe that the three gentlemen, hating evil as much as you do, will grant our request. Sincerely, Wang Zhaoming."</p>

<h3>The Japanese Detain the Director of Changchun Postal Affairs for Interrogating Postal Affairs</h3>
<p>Haserjun Protests Inspection of Mail and is Imprisoned for Two Days, Suffering Humiliation</p>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Workers Union received a report yesterday from the Jilin-Heilongjiang Postal Workers Union regarding the deputy director of the Changchun Postal Bureau, Haserjun, being detained by the Japanese army for protesting the inspection of mail. He was released, went to Harbin for medical treatment, and the incident was reported to postal circles in Shanghai, as well as a call to resist foreign aggression. The report stated, "Since the Northeast Incident, the areas of Jilin and Changchun in our district have been forcibly occupied by the Japanese army. They have seized our official offices, usurped our political power, killed our people, and destroyed our homes. Their brutality and recklessness are extremely heinous, causing us to feel pain and gnash our teeth. Although the postal bureaus in those areas have fortunately not been occupied, they have completely lost their freedom under the oppression of the Japanese army, and incidents of abuse against our employees are not uncommon. Among them, the case of the detention of Haserjun, the deputy director of the Changchun Postal Bureau, is the most severe. Now, the details of the incident are described as follows:</p>
<p>Details of Imprisonment: In early October of this year, the Japanese Military Police Headquarters stationed in Changchun forcibly dispatched personnel to inspect mail in Changchun. After the bureau reported this, it was ordered to protest on October 23rd. Director Ha of the bureau knew that our country's agencies in the area could no longer exercise their functions, and the arrogance of the Japanese army was at its peak. After the protest, it was inevitable that he would suffer from their poison. However, due to his duty and national sovereignty, he believed that even if there was danger, he could not flinch. Therefore, he resolutely submitted the protest letter to the headquarters. The next morning, he received a telephone summons from the headquarters. The Japanese military police commander was arrogant, his face full of anger. He shouted sternly, 'You dared to protest and openly oppose Japan. You are guilty of unforgivable crimes!' He did not allow any explanation and immediately ordered two military police to put Director Ha into a car and escort him to prison. The military police stood on either side of him, as if escorting a serious prisoner. Passersby were frightened when they saw this. After arriving at the prison, he was stripped of his outer clothing and dragged into a small room. The weather was suddenly cold after the snow, and the windows in the room were wide open. The piercing wind was bone-chilling. Director Ha was shivering and almost unable to control himself because he was thinly dressed. Moreover, since entering the prison, he had been deprived of food and drink. The suffering of cold and hunger was unbearable. At that time, Director Ha thought to himself that if he could not get out of prison within three to five days, he might not be able to preserve his life. The situation was so miserable that it made people feel sad.</p>
<p>Details of Release: After Director Ha was detained, the colleagues in the bureau immediately reported to the local Chinese officials and begged for rescue. However, they were afraid to come forward under the supervision of the Japanese army and said that the Japanese army was discussing the case and even if they came forward, it might not help. The severity of the situation at that time can be imagined. Later, after the bureau reported to the Binjiang Management Bureau, it sent personnel to Changchun and asked the Japanese postal director to intercede. Director Ha was released at 9:30 p.m. on the 25th. He was imprisoned for two days and suffered humiliation. Before leaving the headquarters, the military police commander sternly warned him, saying that this time he would be lenient, but if he committed the same crime again, he would be dealt with severely. Their insidious intentions to find fault and retaliate were already obvious.</p>
<p>Going to Harbin for Treatment: Director Ha suffered a great mental loss during this ordeal. Since his release, he has not been able to eat or sleep well, and his mental state has been extremely weak. On November 4th, he was ordered to come to Harbin to personally report the incident. He has already requested a month's sick leave to recuperate. Unless he calms down and takes care of himself, it will be difficult to recover in a short period of time. Our colleagues at the union believe that Director Ha, in a dangerous environment, disregarded his personal interests and resolutely protested to the Japanese army, which was a colorful scene in the East Province Incident. His great personality and spirit of sacrifice have the value of correcting the customs of the day and awakening the people's hearts, establishing his prestige, and serving as a model for people to admire.</p>
<p>Cooperating to Resist Foreign Aggression: The bandits rely on their power and arrogance to invade our territory and trample on our people. This great humiliation and shame are unforgettable for all of us. Therefore, we specially present the facts and report them far and wide, hoping that our colleagues in the postal circles across the country will remember the urgent national crisis and the increasing foreign insults, and everyone will embrace the sincere heart of defending the country and everyone will鼓起the courage to fight the enemy to the death to save the country and avenge the national shame. Even though Director Ha personally suffered humiliation due to public affairs, the comrades in the country felt his loyalty and encouraged each other, able to add more strength to the work of saving the country, then there has been a considerable price. However, what the colleagues are uneasy about is that Director Ha's illness is not light, and he may not be able to recover in time, and the Changchun area is still occupied by the Japanese army. They are inherently brutal and do not know信義。Since they have deep grievances with Director Ha, it is inevitable that they will take the opportunity to cause trouble. If he returns to the bureau to serve at this time, not only his sick body will not allow it, but also the danger ahead is really worrying. He should stay in Harbin for a long time to recuperate and avoid accidents. As for Director Ha, who is loyal to his duties and not afraid of difficulties and dangers, how should the public reward and commend him heavily to encourage public loyalty, and how should he be given special consideration to ensure his safety? The Postal Administration must be able to make excellent plans for this. In addition to the fact that the union has held a meeting to comfort Director Ha after he came to Harbin and has always advised him to recuperate in order to recover his health as soon as possible, we are hereby reporting this to you. Sincerely, Jilin-Heilongjiang Postal Workers Union, November 6th.</p>
<h3>Various Agencies and Groups Met Yesterday to Discuss Remedies for Cotton Textile Raw Materials</h3>
<p>Advising British Merchants to Voluntarily Transport Goods to Shanghai</p>
<p>To be Handled According to Party Branch Methods When Unable to Supply</p>
<p>Since the silk mercerizing and cotton weaving industry in this city rejected Japanese raw materials, the demand for domestic raw materials has exceeded the supply, resulting in panic. The Bureau of Social Affairs believes that if business were suspended, the livelihood of workers and the national industry would be greatly affected. Therefore, it specially invited relevant agencies and groups to hold a meeting yesterday morning to discuss remedies. Zhang Pansun from the Bureau of Industry and Commerce Visiting Group of the Ministry of Industry, Zhou Funong from the Municipal Party Branch, Pan Xusheng from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Qu Xingen from the Federation of Chinese Cotton Mills, and Zhu Wengi from the Silk Mercerizing and Cotton Weaving Industry Association attended. Wu Huanru, Section Chief of the Bureau of Social Affairs of the Municipal Government, presided over the meeting. First, the chairman reported on the process. Then, the representatives expressed their opinions on the lack of raw materials in the silk mercerizing and dyeing industry after rejecting Japanese raw materials. The following four decisions were made regarding remedies: (1) The Industry and Commerce Visiting Group should contact British merchants and foreign firms in Shanghai to persuade them to voluntarily transport British yarns to Shanghai, ensuring that they will not suffer unexpected losses. They should not wait and see and miss this opportunity. (2) The industry association should unite and directly order British goods from British merchants and foreign firms, and then distribute them to various factories after they arrive in Shanghai. (3) There are many Russian yarns on the market, but they are not purchased for various difficulties. (4) If British raw materials cannot be supplied, workers will be handled according to the methods decided by the Municipal Party Branch. The meeting adjourned at 1 p.m.</p>
<h3>Fallacies in Japanese Newspaper</h3>
<p>The Chinese Should Strive to Boycott Goods to the End and Not Repeat the Laughter of Five Minutes</p>
<p>The Shanghai Japanese Daily published an article the day before yesterday predicting the "Collapse of Economic Severance," slandering the boycott as "Filling Their Own Pockets." The original text said, "The economic severance of this anti-Japanese and national salvation movement is different from the past. It does not allow the sale of Japanese goods under the national salvation fund system, so the association's income is quite small, and the committee members cannot fill their own pockets as expected. Then, the compulsory strikes of textile workers and dockworkers cannot be planned. As for the recent absolute economic severance, there are also signs of shaking. That is, the Anti-Japanese Association published the method of paying the national salvation fund in Chinese newspapers on the 13th, with the date of import of the goods into the area as the difference: those before July 14th pay 15% of the price, those from the 15th to the 24th pay 20%, those from the 16th to September 18th pay 25%, and those imported after September 19th will be sold with a pass issued by the Anti-Japanese Association (price unknown). (Translator's note: The above articles were proposed by the Economic Severance Association and have nothing to do with the Anti-Japanese Association.) On the merchant's side, the maximum is limited to 5%. There seems to be a reluctance to comply with the above rates. There were also negotiations with the Anti-Japanese Association for this yesterday, and it is expected that a compromise can be reached within today or tomorrow. The spirit of the average Chinese merchant has also softened. As for the degree of implementation of the aforementioned methods, the so-called economic severance has gradually passed its peak."</p>
<h3>Workers of the Great East Book Company Strike</h3>
<p>All the employees of the Great East Book Company headquarters have been repeatedly requested to improve the conditions of employment and seek agreement with the company. However, the company has never sincerely accepted the request. As a result, the indignation of all the employees has been aroused. From yesterday, all the employees have gone on strike to promote the company's awareness.</p>
<h3>Special News from the Shipping Industry</h3>
<p>British Ship Catches Fire: The Xue Wu Huaer ship, managed by Yitai Foreign Company, came to Shanghai from New York, carrying a lot of American cotton. It was docked at the Zhaoshangju North Warehouse for unloading. At 11 a.m. the day before yesterday, smoke suddenly came out of the ship's cargo hold. When the shipowner learned about it, he ordered the crew and sailors to try their best to put out the fire, but the fire had already burned the cotton. For a while, the flames pierced through the hatch and spread fiercely. Later, the fire truck arrived after hearing the news, and cooperated with the crew to try their best to absorb water and shoot. It was not until 5 p.m. yesterday that the remaining fire was extinguished. A lot of cotton in the cabin was burned, and the unburned cotton was also damaged by water. The Yitai Foreign Company is now handling the摊水。</p>

This huge sum was transported and declared by the Shanghai Bank, Nanrongji, Beihengmao, Xinshengchang, Tongjulong, Litaichang, Dongshengji, Yishengshun, and other customs agents.</p>

<h3>Meeting of the National Government Relief Committee's Technical Committee</h3>
<p>Eight Important Flood Prevention Plans Approved</p>
<p>Four Suggestions to the National Government</p>
<p>All Plans Expected to Be Implemented by the End of This Month</p>
<p>The Technical Committee of the National Government Flood Relief Committee held two meetings yesterday, from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM and from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM, at the Banking Club at 4 Hong Kong Road. Over twenty flood prevention plans for the constitution, construction guidelines, and the Grand Canal, Han River, and Gan River were approved. The details of the meeting are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Attending Representatives: The attendees included Shi Ying, Director of the Zhejiang Construction Department; Shen Baixian, Director of the Jiangsu Construction Department; Wang Huiguang, representative from Hunan; Zhu Xishang, Director of the Yangtze River Works Bureau; Zhou Xiangxian and Li Jin, members of the National Government Relief Committee; Li Xie, Zhu Yong, and Zhu Enlian, Chief Engineers; Xiang Kai, Deputy Chief Engineer; Xi Dexiong, Director of the Labor Relief Office; Qiu Zhidao and Chen Chongwu, representatives from Hubei; Kong Herong, representative from Shandong; Stowe, Chief Engineer of the Yangtze River; Chadley, Engineer of the Jianghai Customs; and over twenty other Chinese and foreign personnel.</p>
<p>Meeting Details: The committee held two meetings yesterday. The first meeting started at 9:00 AM and adjourned at 11:45 AM. The second meeting started at 2:00 PM and adjourned around 7:00 PM after discussions. The attendees were the same for both the morning and afternoon sessions.</p>
<p>Results of the Two Meetings: In addition to the three items reported by the chairman during the morning meeting—(1) the survey of the disaster areas, (2) the construction guidelines, and (3) the construction specifications—the following were also passed in principle, after revisions: Chief Engineer Li Yizhi's proposed draft of the committee's charter, draft of construction standards, draft of construction methods, the case of the occupation of people's land for dike construction, how to repair dikes and embankments that are not covered by the committee's projects, and the proposal to stipulate dike types. Additionally, the causes of this year's floods, proposed by the Chief Engineer of the Yangtze River, were reviewed and passed, to be used as a reference by the Chief Engineer. Items passed during the afternoon meeting included: Case 9, the Huai River dike project plan; Case 10, the Yangtze River dike project plan; Case 11, the Hui Xia River drainage project plan; Case 12, the Grand Canal dike project plan; Case 13, the Hankou flood prevention plan; Case 14, the Gan River flood prevention plan; Case 15, the Han River flood prevention plan; Case 16, the Hunan dike and embankment issues. All of the above were submitted to the Standing Committee of the National Government Relief Committee for execution and approved to be implemented by the end of the month. Case 17, flood prevention should simultaneously focus on revitalizing water conservancy to benefit the people; Case 18, it is proposed to complete the Tai Lake water conservancy project ahead of schedule to save the flood-stricken counties of western Zhejiang; Case 19, the construction of reservoirs in the eastern and western Tianmu Mountains to prevent flooding, were decided to be left for the National Government to handle. Case 20, suggestions for improving the waterways of Dongting Lake and the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, was retained for reference. Case 21, a temporary motion, the disaster prevention plan for counties along the Grand Canal in Shandong, was submitted to the Chief Engineer for reference.</p>
<p>Construction Guidelines: This year's continuous rain has caused flooding, and the disaster area spans fifteen or sixteen provinces. The most severely affected areas have been aerially photographed by the committee to map the disaster areas. The damage suffered by the disaster areas is very complex. The committee's work involves repairing dikes and banks and removing accumulated water. Repairing dikes and banks includes patching breaches, thickening and raising embankments, straightening bends, and building new dikes. Removing accumulated water includes discharging it into the river, channeling it into the sea, or diverting it from low-lying areas into rivers. The existing river channels should be dredged and connected to provide direct and unobstructed paths. This is the general situation of the engineering work to be implemented. The committee's construction method is to divide the area into labor relief districts based on river systems and taking into account provincial and county boundaries. Each district is further divided into sections, sections into groups, and groups into squads. Each squad consists of twenty-five people, each group of twenty squads, totaling five hundred people. Each section consists of ten groups, totaling five thousand people. The number of sections under the jurisdiction of each district is determined based on the scope of the project and geographical relations. This is the general situation of the labor relief district division. Each labor relief district has a labor relief administration, with one engineer, one to two deputy engineers, two to four engineers or surveyors, four to six clerks, and two secretaries. Each section has a labor relief office, with one engineer in charge, one engineer, two to four clerks, and one secretary. Each group has one foreman and one deputy foreman. Each squad has a squad leader selected from among the workers based on their honesty and intelligence. This is the general situation of the engineering organization. Each district's project is vast, and the number of workers needed was originally estimated to be one million disaster victims. However, because 150,000 tons of wheat were allocated for urgent relief and agricultural relief, the remaining amount is now 300,000 tons, and the number of workers has also been reduced to 650,000. It is planned to recruit 40,000 workers by the end of this month, 80,000 in December, 100,000 in January, 150,000 in February, 200,000 in March, and 80,000 in April. If the number of disaster victims is insufficient, other workers will be hired to supplement the workforce. As the projects yield results, workers will be dismissed in stages to return to farming. It is planned to dismiss 150,000 in May, 350,000 in June, 80,000 in July, 40,000 in August, and 30,000 in September. This is the general situation of worker recruitment and dismissal. The 450,000 tons of wheat loaned from the United States will be shipped continuously starting this month. The estimated arrival dates are 48,000 tons in November, 52,000 tons in December, 86,000 tons each in January, February, and March, and 85,000 tons in April. Wheat grain stations will be set up in Shanghai, Pukou, Wuhu, Anqing, Jiujiang, and Hankou. The transportation and storage will be managed by the committee's transportation team and storage and transportation office. In the next month or two, labor relief will not be carried out on a large scale. It is planned to allocate wheat grain for urgent relief first, and then mostly for labor relief thereafter. This is the general situation of American wheat transportation. It is most difficult to distribute wheat grain evenly. The amount of wheat grain depends on the number of workers, and the number of workers depends on the amount of earthwork. The surveys in various locations have not yet been completed. For now, the amount of wheat grain of American wheat (300,000 tons) will be divided based on the amount of earthwork needed for the old dikes. 40,000 tons will be used as reserved for engineering and twenty-six tons will be temporary distributed proportionally for earthwork artificially to various rivers, Yangzi River, Hankou, Xiangyuan, Huaihe, Grand canal, Xiangxia River and Hongying Rivers. The excess wheat grain will compensate the shortage when conducting the construction. Workers are recruited and dismissed monthly. Assuming 500,000 people are employed, there should be 20,000 squads and 1,000 groups. About 100 squads need surveying instruments, with 10 theodolites, 100 levels and hand levels, 500 tape measures, 400 leveling rods, and 20,000 bamboo measuring rods, as well as wooden stakes, iron axes, notebooks, and pencils. About 200,000 hoes, 80,000 rakes, 400,000 zhang of rope, 300,000 carrying poles, 600,000 baskets, and 6,000 rammers are needed. Instruments are borrowed from various agencies as much as possible. Workers who bring their own tools are also welcome to use them. These are the plans for the disposal of materials. The above describes the Labor Relief Office's planning and implementation of labor relief and engineering facilities. As for whether the future implementation and results will be excellent, it depends entirely on the opinions and guidance of the gentlemen attending today's meeting, so that we can gather wisdom and benefit from each other, make smooth progress, and the disaster victims can be blessed with boundless grace.</p>
<p>Construction Standards Rationale: After this flood, dikes and embankments have collapsed in many places. With limited resources, the committee cannot repair them all one by one. Therefore, we follow the principle of treating the symptoms in an emergency, distinguishing between the urgency and importance of dike projects, constructing in sections, and providing relief based on labor. Based on this principle, eight construction standards are specified. We respectfully await your public decision on whether they are appropriate. Methods: (1) The scope of labor relief is limited to earthwork, and the types of projects are mainly the repair of main dikes, with dredging and draining water as secondary. (2) Dike repair focuses on the main rivers, particularly the parts that collapsed during this year's floods. (3) Dike repair should restore the original state or be able to resist floods like this year's. (4) Dikes that are dilapidated may be slightly modified, such as increasing the height, thickening the base, or straightening bends. (5) If the cost of earthwork does not exceed the cost of repairing the old dike, a new dike may be built when repairing the old dike. (6) To facilitate the drainage of accumulated water, existing river channels may be dredged or old river channels may be connected, but new channels should not be opened.</p>
<h3>Japanese Soldiers Assault Again</h3>
<p>Rickshaw Puller Beaten Nearly to Death</p>
<p>Japanese soldiers have been harassing and causing trouble in the eastern part of Shanghai recently, which has been heard daily. The other day, a Chinese child and workers were severely beaten by violent soldiers on Pingliang Road, which is clear evidence. Unexpectedly, only a day later, many bored Japanese marines caused trouble in broad daylight and arbitrarily beat Chinese people. The incident occurred around 5:53 PM yesterday. A rickshaw puller was pulling his rickshaw, passing the intersection of Taopeng Road and Pingliang Road, when suddenly more than ten Japanese soldiers followed behind on motorcycles. As they approached the rickshaw puller, the Japanese soldiers got off one by one. The leader suddenly threw a punch, hitting the rickshaw puller in the back. The rickshaw puller was confused and looked back. The violent Japanese soldiers were not satisfied, took another step forward, and slapped the rickshaw puller dozens of times. At the same time, they kicked the rickshaw puller in the shins. Then they laughed wildly a few times and swaggered away. When passersby saw this situation, they gnashed their teeth and shouted, wanting to get their hands on the perpetrator. However, the Japanese soldiers stroked the guns they wore on their waists and, amid leering and arrogance, jumped into their vehicles and sped away. By the time the police heard the news and sent officers, the Japanese soldiers had already disappeared into the smoke and noise. The injured rickshaw puller had to return home in a sorry state and go to the hospital for treatment. As he left, his eyes were filled with tears, and he stumbled with every step. The onlookers could only watch him leave with a sigh.</p>
<h3>Fire on Min'guo Road Kills Two</h3>
<p>One Old and One Young Charred beyond Recognition</p>
<p>Two Corpses Too Horrific to Look At</p>
<p>The Mao Yutai sofa chair shop at No. 391 Min'guo Road in the French Concession was opened by Mao Yufen (66 years old), a native of Fenghua. Recently, due to old age, he rented the shop to his relative Wang Jinyu for business. Mr. Mao and his wife and six-year-old granddaughter, Xiaoya Nv, lived on the mezzanine floor. The upper floor was sublet to others. Yesterday morning at 5:20 AM, a fire broke out from an unknown cause, spreading and piercing the roof. Mao and his family and cohabitants were awakened from their dreams and escaped. Because Xiaoya Nv was still in danger, Mao turned back to rescue his granddaughter, but was blocked by the flames and could not escape, causing both him and his granddaughter to die in the fire. The fire department was notified and immediately dispatched fire engines to extinguish the fire. However, the sofa shop was completely destroyed, and the fire also damaged the neighboring buildings. Afterwards, firefighters dug out two bodies, one large and one small, from the rubble. Both were charred beyond recognition and too horrific to look at. The bodies were immediately sent to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch for examination. The police sent detectives to investigate the cause of the fire. At 10:00 AM, the police reported to the Second Special Court, and Prosecutor Ding Shikui, along with forensic doctor Wei Ligong and clerk Peng Yi, arrived for the examination. Mao Xinhui, the son of the deceased, requested exemption from the examination and planned to collect the bodies himself. After Mr. Ding questioned the corpse's family about the fire, he approved the exemption from the examination, and the corpse was handed over to the son of the deceased, who provided a written guarantee to collect the bodies.</p>
<h3>程霖生 Sues Tenants over House Eviction Dispute</h3>
<p>Submitting a Petition to Declare Provisional Execution, Tenants Offer Four Rebuttal Points Based on Significant Relationships, Requesting Attention to Shanghai Customs</p>
<p>Wealthy merchant Cheng Linsheng, desiring to rebuild all his houses on Nanking Road, Route des Soeurs, and Yixin Lane into Western-style buildings, sent notices to each tenant to move out. The tenants refused, so he hired lawyer Wang Youling to file a petition with the First Special Court, requesting a judgment ordering the tenants Taichang Wood Shop Xiao Hanji, Shen Yongyang, Sun Guangtai, Dadechang, Hengkang, Xu Senchang, Cheng Shiliang, Chen Songzhou, Huang Jinqing, Hengyi Gong, Mao Yushu, Tu Daozhou, Paris Hotel, Rongchangxiang, Wu Baosun, and sixteen other households to move out, and requesting a declaration of provisional execution.</p>
<p>The original petition of the plaintiff states that his reasons are as follows: The plaintiff owns houses in the Yixin Lane area of Tibet Road, which have been rented to Taichang Wood Shop and others for residence. Some of these leases have fixed terms that have already expired (such as Taichang Shop), while others have terms that have not yet expired (such as Rongchangxiang). However, the majority are tenants with indefinite leases. Because the plaintiff needs all the tenants to move out, he refuses to renew the leases of those whose terms have expired. As for those whose terms have not yet expired, he gave them prior notice to allow them to prepare to move. As for tenants with indefinite leases, he could terminate the contract at any time, and he even gave them a two-month grace period and agreed to waive two months' rent. His preferential treatment of the tenants has already exceeded ordinary practice. Unexpectedly, while some tenants did not object, the majority of households refused to move. He applied to your court for mediation without success. Article 450 of the Civil Code stipulates that if a lease has a fixed term, the lease relationship terminates upon the expiration of the term. Furthermore, Paragraph 2 of the same article states that if a lease has an indefinite term, each party may terminate the contract at any time. Now, the defendants are resisting moving out, which clearly violates legal provisions and damages the plaintiff's rights. In addition to reserving the right to claim damages, he is first filing a lawsuit to demand eviction. He requests that Rongchangxiang be ordered to move out immediately after the lease term expires, and that the fifteen defendants, including Taichang Wood Shop, be ordered to move out immediately. He also requests a declaration of provisional execution in accordance with Article 462, Paragraph 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure. In addition to Taichang Wood Shop hiring lawyer Chen Zhaoqi for defense, the remaining households including Rongchangxiang jointly hired lawyers Yu Hualong and Wang Chuanbi to file a response. Excerpts of the arguments for defense are as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding Rongchangxiang, Rongchangxiang rented the house at 648 Nanking Road and paid a large tip. In the autumn of the eighteenth year [of the Republic, i.e., 1929], a portion of the house was destroyed by fire, and they negotiated with the landlord to rebuild a formal three-story building. Cheng entrusted Dehe Foreign Firm to complete the drawings and ordered Rongchangxiang to advance the construction costs, stating that the lease term could be extended by seven years and the rent would be increased by one hundred taels. Now, the plaintiff, knowing that the value of the land and house has increased due to the beneficial expenses incurred by the defendant, suddenly wants to renovate and move them out for no reason. In terms of reason and sentiment, this is a clear breach of contract and bad faith. Furthermore, according to Article 832 of the Property Law of the Civil Code, the defendant, with the plaintiff's consent, has the right to use the land on which the building is built, and has obtained the surface rights to the land. Unless the defendant is in arrears with rent, the landowner may not revoke the surface rights. The plaintiff's lawsuit should be rejected.</p>
<p>Regarding the other defendants, Article 450, Paragraph 2 of the Civil Code clearly stipulates that "if there are customs that are beneficial to the lessee, those customs shall be followed." According to Shanghai customs for renting houses, (1) rent is in arrears for more than three months; (2) the house is dilapidated and there is a real need for renovation (after renovation, the old tenants still have the right of first refusal); (3) the landlord cannot order the tenants to move out unless the landlord takes back the house for his own use. Although no term was agreed upon at the beginning of the defendants' lease, they dared to pay a large tip and renovation fee based on the above customs. Furthermore, the house is not dilapidated and there is no need to renovate it. The plaintiffs have ulterior motives and rashly order them to move out, which has no legal basis. The plaintiff's lawsuit should be rejected.</p>
<p>Regarding provisional execution, since the two parties in this case have a dispute over whether the lease should be terminated, this is a lawsuit involving lease rights and naturally does not fall under the jurisdiction of the primary court (see Judgment No. 2988 of the Supreme Court on the Dalun case, November 19 [of the Republic, i.e., 1930]). Reviewing the summons of your court, it is stated that the case is No. 452 of the Land Division of the 20th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1931], considering that this case falls under the jurisdiction of the local court. Article 462, Paragraph 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which the plaintiffs cited, refers to a judgment in which the defendant loses in the second category of lawsuits. Since this case does not fall under the jurisdiction of the primary court, there is no room for applying this article. The request for a declaration of provisional execution should be rejected. First, many of the defendants are stores, and the value of the selected goods is over a million, all of which meet the standards of fashion. However, fashion changes with each passing day. If provisional execution is suddenly declared, the goods worth several million will inevitably be shelved, and their value will inevitably plummet. This kind of damage is not only difficult to calculate, but also puts them in a state of irreparable ruin. The request should be rejected. Second, the defendants all have business relationships and have extended credit to various ports in the interior. If they suddenly cease business, the debtors will never deal with them again, and the outstanding payments will all be stalled. Who will be responsible for this kind of damage? The request should be rejected. Third, the defendants employ more than a thousand workers, who usually rely on wages to make a living. If they suddenly cease business, it will directly cause several thousand workers to starve to death, and indirectly cause the families of several thousand people to fall into destitution. At a time when the brutal sun is trampling the Northeast, floods have spread across the country, and the Shanghai market is depressed, and the people are struggling to survive, the plaintiffs are also fellow countrymen. Why must they put the economically weak to death? The request should be rejected. Based on the above reasons, the defendants jointly appeal to your court to reject the plaintiffs' lawsuit and the request for a declaration of provisional execution."</p>
<p>Request to investigate Shanghai customs. Yesterday morning, Judge Yang Yi of the Tenth Civil Division summoned the parties. After the plaintiff stated the facts of the lawsuit through his lawyer, he requested a quick hearing to avoid losses to the plaintiff. Chen Zhaoqi, the lawyer for Taichang Shop, stated that Taichang had subleased the house to others and had already sued the three tenants. Lawyers Wang Chuanbi and others requested an investigation into Shanghai customs. Judge Yang then announced that the case would be adjourned and scheduled for another hearing.</p>
<h3>Datong Music Society Organizes New Chinese Military Band</h3>
<p>Full team of sixty-four people</p>
<p>The relationship between military music and morale is even more important than the relationship between national music and national character. According to research, our country invented this type of band two thousand years ago, during the Eastern Han dynasty, called Rao Ge. Cao Cao of the Three Kingdoms used it to conquer Wuhuan. It was highly valued by successive dynasties, and was still popular during the Southern Song dynasty, with as many as one hundred and eighty members. In the late Qing dynasty, it was only occasionally seen during the grand military reviews of the governors-general, but it had degenerated to the extreme. The instruments used were only shawms, bamboo flutes, drums, gongs, and cymbals. The number of people was only about ten. Later, Western military music entered China and it was completely abandoned. Now, the Datong Music Society in this city, which is dedicated to reviving ancient music, recently felt inspired by the rise of volunteer armies in various places. Last Sunday, it convened a meeting of all members of the grand orchestra and decided to organize a national military band. The full team will consist of sixty-four people. Half of the team will be organized first, and preparations have already begun. Various new instruments with loud volumes will be manufactured. The music used will be selected from the applicable parts of the original twenty-eight chapters of the Rao Ge score for practice. It should be implemented soon. This music is purely martial in nature. With this, national music should become more complete.</p>
<h3>Song Xueqin's Defense</h3>
<p>Refuting his Daughter's Lawsuit</p>
<p>Song Xueqin, the former director of the Shanghai Office during the Sun Chuanfang era, was suddenly abandoned by his concubine Bo Xuezhen in May of this year. He signed a separation agreement with witnesses such as Gao Zixi and gave Bo Xuezhen and their daughter Lizhen a total of 20,000 yuan in alimony and education/marriage expenses according to the predetermined distribution method, permanently severing relations. For some reason, Bo Xuezhen recently hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the name of their daughter Song Lizhen. A case of a daughter suing her father is rare. It is heard that Song Xueqin has entrusted lawyers Wang Yintai and Wang Chuanbi to provide a defense, and we have obtained the defense statement for publication as follows:</p>
<p>In the Matter of Legally Defending: Defendant Song Xueqin, upon receiving a copy of the complaint filed by plaintiff Song Lizhen, through her legal representative Bo Xuezhen, seeking alimony and an education fund, was deeply surprised after reading it. The reasons for the defense are presented below: In May of the 20th year of the Republic [of China, i.e., 1931], Bo Xuezhen, the legal representative of the plaintiff in this case, requested to separate from the defendant. A separation agreement was signed and the defendant gave Song Lizhen and Bo Xuezhen a total of 20,000 yuan, which was temporarily used as alimony, the plaintiff's education fund, and marriage expenses. This is not disputed by the plaintiff and her legal representative. Unexpectedly, the ink was not yet dry before they started a lawsuit. This is unreasonable. First, Song Lizhen, the plaintiff, is only seven years old and has no ability to freely express her intentions. All her actions are advocated by Bo Xuezhen in an attempt to defraud money, which goes without saying. Bo Xuezhen did not obtain the plaintiff's consent and used the plaintiff as a tool for extortion, which is legally invalid. This is unreasonable. Second, the level of education that children can receive should be based on their family's situation. The defendant has exhausted his resources and gave all the expenses to Bo Xuezhen, the plaintiff's legal representative, for safekeeping in May of this year. The defendant has no ability to bear any further burden. This is unreasonable. Third, the defendant followed General Sun Xinyuan as an official for several years, and his salary was not much. As the situation changed, he lived at home. Where did the large sum of money come from? Bo Xuezhen's empty words, falsely claiming that he has accumulated millions, are nothing more than exaggerations to sensationalize and achieve her extortion plan, which has no value for debate. Fourth, the plaintiff ignores the facts, picks up superficial words, uses a daughter to sue her father, and tries to extort money, which is a criminal of morality. In this time of turbulent tides and moral decay, this bad example should not be set to encourage their arrogance. This is not only the interest of the defendant himself, but also concerns the hearts of people and the way of the world. Fifth, combining the above reasons, the statements made by the plaintiff and her legal representative have no basis in human feelings or legal principles. Your court is requested to examine and reject all the requests of the plaintiff in this case and order them to bear the litigation costs, which would be virtuous and convenient. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai First Special District Local Court by the complainant Song Xueqin, through the lawyers acting for the litigation, Wang Yintai and Wang Chuanbi.</p>
<h3>Public Works Bureau Revises Regulations for Managing Automobile Drivers</h3>
<p>Regarding Driver Examination Matters</p>
<p>The Public Works Bureau has registered over 12,200 automobile drivers in the city. According to Article 2 of the Regulations for Managing Drivers, "those who have already obtained a driver's license in the Special District may be temporarily exempted from examination." The bureau believes that the actual driving experience of automobile drivers is particularly important for traffic safety. For the sake of caution, it has been approved by the Municipal Government to cancel the above regulation and add two new articles, namely Article 3: "Any automobile driver who has obtained a driver's license in the Special District or its city or county and can prove that he has six months of driving experience may be exempted from examination, but must pass an oral interview. If any doubts arise, he must still pass the examination before a license can be issued." Article 4: "Any automobile driver who has obtained a driver's license in this city or a driver's license issued by other municipal authorities, but only has experience driving ordinary passenger cars, must be re-examined if he wants to drive freight cars, long-distance buses, public buses, or large cars." It is also learned that the bureau's examination of automobile drivers was originally limited to Monday, Wednesday, and Friday mornings. Now, to facilitate general drivers, examinations are held every morning except Sundays and other holidays.</p>

<h3>All Lights in the French Concession Went Out Last Night</h3>
<p>Restored after Two Hours</p>
<p>At 5:45 PM last night, all the lights in the French Concession suddenly went out, creating a dark world. The most important traffic lights also failed at the same time. Patrolmen directed traffic in the dark, which was very busy. All stores lit candles instead, and kerosene and candles immediately increased tenfold in sales. At 6:20 PM, the lights west of Route de Montigny were restored. From the Xixin Bridge eastward to the Bund, the lights were not restored to their original state until 7:10 PM, and the light reappeared.</p>
<h3>Impersonating Public Officials to Extort Money</h3>
<p>Leading to the Discovery of Illegally Possessed Firearms</p>
<p>Lei Wenkui, a native of Nanxiang, 32 years old, resides at No. 460 Xie Xu Road outside the Old West Gate in the Nanshi area. Lei has been unemployed for two years due to idleness, and his economic life has become increasingly difficult. Recently, he suddenly came up with a bizarre idea and colluded with Xu Xingsheng (also known as Lu Xingsheng), a native of Shaoxing, who lived in the same house. They printed false titles of inspectors of the Shanghai Municipal Public Works Bureau on business cards, and Lei changed his name to Zhang Zhiliang. They specialized in checking the construction and demolition projects of residents in the Chinese area. If they encountered anyone who did not understand the municipal regulations or did not obtain a permit from the Public Works Bureau, they would interfere and threaten the person involved. If they encountered anyone who was timid or wanted to avoid trouble, Lei and others would take the opportunity to use their extortion skills. Some people were even extorted for more than a hundred yuan. Over the past few months, dozens of households have been deceived by them, and Lei and others have relied on this as a way to make a living and worked hard to carry it out. Unexpectedly, due to an uneven distribution of spoils among the accomplices, an internal conflict suddenly arose, which was detected by Dong Mingde, a foreman of the First District General Office. He immediately led detectives Yuan Haishan, Yu Maolong, Lv Anpu, Zhao Fusheng, etc., and went to the address together with the police chief of the Liyuan Road Police Station of the Second District General Office to arrest Lei and Xu. Under interrogation, the two admitted that they had impersonated public officials without denying it. At that time, Lei confessed that Wang Yongsheng, a native of Jiangling, who lived at No. 458 next door, had illegally possessed firearms at home. Dong led Lei and others to point out Wang and arrested him. Sure enough, a pistol was found. Wang confessed that he used to be a tailor, and the pistol was found accidentally while catching mice under the stairs in the room a few days ago. He had given the gun to Lei to look at, who said that the gun was rotten and had long been useless. At that time, he threw the gun in the corner of the house. Wang also confessed that Lei had a revolver at home, which he had seen. The detectives then went to Lei's house and searched carefully. Sure enough, a revolver, five bullets, and many scattered gold and silver ornaments were found. Under further interrogation, Lei confessed that the ornaments were his own, and the pistol was given to him by Chen Chaozong, a member of the third squad of the first platoon of the sixth team of the Shanghai City Security Corps, for safekeeping. Chen is now working as an accountant at the Yuanxing Ice Factory in Rihui Bridge. In a moment, Chen was arrested and confessed that he was 35 years old and a native of Haimen. He said that Lei's confession was completely fabricated and asked for investigation. After Chief Chen interrogated him, he immediately prepared a document and submitted it to the judicial section for investigation, as the case involved illegally possessing firearms, impersonating public officials, and fraud.</p>
<h3>Shen Chengfu's Creditors Vie to Assert Their Rights</h3>
<p>A Dispute between Priority and Common Claims</p>
<p>Shen Chengfu, the compradore of the British firm Taikoo 洋行, owed millions of debts and was unable to repay them. After he abandoned his job and fled in August, his father Shen Yingxiang's Zhiheyongji Money Shop was implicated and went bankrupt. In addition, there were many lawsuits filed by various creditors against Shen Chengfu. For example, Shen had mortgaged the land deed No. 13279 英册 (English registration) for 7 mu, 2 fen, 5 li, and 7 hao (units of area) of land and the adjacent land of 2 mu and 9 li and 8 hao 方單 (single piece) to Ankang Money Shop for a mortgage of 30,000 taels of silver. He sold it to Yisheng Real Estate Company for an agreed price of 259,875 taels of silver. The company paid a deposit of 30,000 taels. Later, Shen fled and the transaction was not completed. The company sued in the First Special Court, which has already made a judgment, ordering the plaintiff to pay the land price of 229,875 taels into the court and allowing the company to manage the land. Furthermore, the contractor Lu Yongshun built a western-style house for Shen on Avenue Haig, but was owed construction costs. He also requested the court to recognize his mortgage right of 35,000 taels on the house. The judgments in these two cases have been dissatisfied by other creditors, including Geng Yumingji Money Shop, Rongkang Money Shop, Hefeng Money Shop, Huifeng Money Shop, and Chunyuan Money Shop. Shen owes these shops a total of over 75,600 taels. If the claims of Yisheng Company and Lu Yongshun are recognized as priority claims, other creditors will suffer losses. Therefore, they hired lawyers Wu Linkun and Yuan Hanyun to sue in the First Special District Local Court, requesting a judgment ordering Shen Chengfu to repay the debts owed to the shops, and requesting confirmation that the 30,000 taels of deposit paid by Yisheng Real Estate Company is also a common claim, and that the construction work done by Lu Yongshun to build the house is now only worth 10,000 taels, and Lu's claim can only be determined based on this amount. Yesterday morning, Judge Guo held a hearing. Representatives of each shop brought account books to prove the amount owed. The issues involving Yisheng and Lu Yongshun involved legal issues, and lawyers Wu and Yuan, as well as Cai Rudong, the lawyer representing Yisheng Company, and Xu Shihao, the lawyer representing Lu, debated based on legal principles. Judge Guo then announced that the judgment would be announced on the morning of the 19th of this month.</p>
<h3>Gambling Case Cracked in the French Concession</h3>
<p>Hua Agen, a native of Suzhou, privately set up a gambling den at No. 23 Baoxing Lane in the French Concession, gathering people to gamble on pai gow and profiting from the commission. Lu Jinchen, the chief detective of the French Concession Police, and Wang Rusong, the deputy detective, etc., detected this and raided the place the night before, confiscating gambling equipment and foreign banknotes worth 8,912 yuan, and arresting 23 gamblers. They were all taken to the police station. The police chief ordered the gamblers to pay 10 yuan each as bail, and Hua was detained. Yesterday, they were sent to the Criminal Simplified Court of the Second Special Court. The police lawyer Chen Ming stated the facts of the case. Hua confessed that it was his mother's birthday and friends came to congratulate her, so they played pai gow for entertainment and did not dare to take a commission. Judge Ma Shounan verified the confession and sentenced Hua Agen to a fine of 800 yuan and the gamblers to a fine of 10 yuan each. The gambling equipment and gambling funds were confiscated according to the list.</p>

The president of the association launched an impromptu donation to support General Ma. In a moment, several hundred yuan were raised on the spot and handed over to Wang Xiaolai to be remitted to Heilongjiang Province. This kind of patriotic enthusiasm is truly rare. The second part was the harmonica championship. The judges were Ms. Hu Zhou Shu, Chu Minyi, Huang Jinwu, and Wang, the president of the association. There were five contestants in each of the male and female groups. The top three were selected for the finals. The names are recorded below.

Finally, there was a speech by Pan Yangyao, who used the topic to expand and elaborate, which was lively and incisive. The harmonica team then played the triumphal march and the concert ended at 11:00 PM.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the esteemed reporter of Shen Bao: Recently, I saw in various newspapers that a reporter from the Daily News had published an interview with me that included criticisms of the League of Nations. I hereby solemnly declare that I did not make any such statements. At a time when the conflict between China and Japan is severe, the League of Nations' stance is clearly sympathetic to China. I sincerely hope that the League of Nations can further uphold international faith and world peace to restrain Japan's atrocities, and this is something I would say. However, to vehemently criticize it would be unwise, as it would turn those who are sympathetic to us into feeling resentment. I have always used this to advise others, and I would certainly not do it myself. I respectfully request that this letter be published in your newspaper to clarify the truth. As for the issue with Japan, we cannot rely solely on the League of Nations to help us; we must rely on our own ability to resist and our determination to sacrifice. This goes without saying. With best regards, Wang Zhaoming, November 16th.</p>
<p>Note: This newspaper did not publish the news about Mr. Wang's interview with the Daily News reporter yesterday. This statement is made for clarification.</p>
<p>Dear Sirs: I have just read in the local news section of your October 29th issue an article stating that Chen Qiyu has contracted to collect the tax on tobacco seedlings in southern Fujian. After reading it, I was extremely astonished. I am a Christian and have served as an elder for over thirty years. I have always been careful in my conduct and devoted to practicing medicine and running my business. I have never interfered in any local affairs. How could I dare to contract to collect the tobacco tax, thus violating church regulations? The information published in your newspaper is definitely a false report. I am writing this letter to request that you investigate and correct it. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai Shen Bao, Chen Qiyu of Zhangzhou, November 7th.</p>

<h3>A Message from Mr. Zhang Xu Tang</h3>
<p>(Supporting Mr. Lu Shifang's Proposal to Punish Corruption)</p>
<p>Mr. Lu Shifang's advocacy for punishing corrupt officials is indeed the key to clarifying politics, saving the country, and resisting foreign aggression today. The biggest problems facing the nation and society today are violations of laws and regulations, and the acceptance of bribes. Even when reported, those who are corrupt are not punished, which has led to the current deplorable situation where "there is no moral standard above and no law to abide by below." If this continues, corruption, treason, and奸商will only increase. How can we hope that the country will not be in chaos and the nation will not perish? It is painful to say and infuriating to think about. After our disappointment, we can only rely on the united strength of our citizens to use public opinion to restrain and punish them. The method is that, regardless of their field or identity, those whose words and deeds are consistent, who are honest and simple, who act for the public and the country, and who meet the qualifications of excellent citizens, should be unanimously supported, respected, and assisted by the people. Those whose words and deeds are inconsistent, who are deceitful and treacherous, who are corrupt and licentious, who harm the country and the people, and who meet the qualifications of bad citizens, should be unanimously warned against and denounced by the people. The goal is to make those who are corrupt, licentious, harm the country, and deceive the people, even if they are wealthy, be cut off from all interaction by the people, to show disapproval, and to have no place in society. If compatriots across the country can immediately implement this method, its effectiveness will be no less than execution. Only then can the declining trend be reversed, and the path to a bright future for the country, society, and nation can be unfolded. It is hoped that compatriots across the country will put aside personal feelings, strive to promote and implement this. Although Xu Tang's heart for saving the country is long, his academic ability is short. If the above words are of any benefit to the country and society, please publish them in your esteemed newspaper.</p>
<p>To Mr. Jiang Xiufeng: Regarding your letter of November 8th stating that you sent the Regulations for Resisting Japanese Goods and two remittances, our department has not received them. We hereby inform you. Shanghai Shen Bao Reader Correspondence Department</p>

<h3>Market News</h3>
<p>The Guanshengyuan Food Company on Nanjing Road announced that, starting yesterday, the company, in conjunction with the old store on Nine Acres and its three branches, is holding its 13th-anniversary celebration, following the old practice of offering a year-long sale for three weeks. Various goods are being sold at discounts of 30% to 10%, or buy-one-get-one-free items. There are more styles than in previous years. Yesterday was the first day of the sale, and business was booming, breaking all previous records. The buy-one-get-one-free items were especially welcomed by purchasers, and the demand greatly exceeded the supply.</p>
<p>The British-owned Pathe Company at No. 118 Sichuan Road announced that various records produced by the company have always been welcomed by all sectors of society. The recently released four-and-a-half-minute steel needle records are especially popular. However, these records play for a longer time. If played with ordinary steel needles from other brands, the needle tip will be worn down halfway through, and the sound will be turbid and low, which is very unpleasant. To compensate for this deficiency, the company has newly manufactured a red box of Chicken Brand steel needles, with 200 needles per box, which are most suitable for playing records. The price is low, and major record player companies in the city and other places are selling them.</p>
<p>The Baofang Company at the east end of the New World on Nanjing Road announced that it has newly imported a large number of record players from abroad, with novel designs and accurate sound. They can be used legally and can maintain the original sound even after ten years. To give preferential treatment to all sectors of society, they are being sold at low prices at the same time as other records.</p>
<p>The Sino-American Department Store at the Xinxiao Bridge in the French Concession announced that since its opening, winter goods have been selling well, with wool products being the most popular. Manager Hu Xiongfei is overseeing the production of self-made woolen goods, with low prices. Bee brand wool sweaters weighing two pounds each are only $7.65. At a time when there is a boycott of enemy goods, patriotic youths will surely compete to buy them.</p>
<p>The Gaoerfu Ball Court in the Meilai House across from the New Vegetable Market has a convenient location and exquisite construction. It has an American train, famous scenic spots from various provinces, airships, real mountains and rivers, and rare flowers and plants. It also has excellent prizes. Once it opens, it will surely be welcomed by customers.</p>

<h3>Marshal Foch's Diary of the European War</h3>
<p>— Translated by Gu Angruo</p>
<p>During the first two weeks of October, our army had not yet occupied the northern Rhineland, but the southern Rhineland was already in our control. On October 8th, the conditions I proposed required the occupation of three bridgeheads on the northern bank of the Rhine. In this way, our army could directly attack the central Rhineland if the peace talks failed and the war restarted.</p>
<p>My proposal differed greatly from the terms of withdrawal announced by the American president. However, President Wilson's minimum prerequisite for an armistice did not mean that other conditions deemed necessary by the Allied forces could not be proposed. Therefore, when the Allied representatives gathered at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Paris on the afternoon of October 9th, I put forward the conditions.</p>
<p>Although Mr. Clemenceau advocated not participating in the negotiations between Berlin and Washington, Mr. Lloyd George strongly urged the other representatives to notify President Wilson, so as to avoid future misunderstandings, and to pay attention to the fact that his conditions lacked details. The British Prime Minister said that President Wilson's conditions "cannot prevent the German army from using the opportunity of the armistice to deploy superior military positions, and then attempt a counterattack once the peace agreement breaks down. The German army will take advantage of the armistice opportunity to escape from their predicament, rescue military supplies, reorganize their troops, shorten their defense lines, retreat to new positions, and slowly prepare their defenses."</p>
<p>He also said, "Armistice conditions cannot be decided before military experts have consulted and military situations have been studied..."</p>
<p>Mr. Lloyd George's proposal was insightful, because the German army's ambition had not died, and it would certainly take the opportunity to attempt a resurgence.</p>
<p>On October 12th, Prince Barton hurriedly notified the Washington government, "Prepare to conclude an armistice treaty based on President Wilson's terms of withdrawal."</p>
<p>But by that time, the American president had already received the Allied warning of this danger, and then took a strong stance. On October 14th, he telegraphed the German Prime Minister,</p>
<p>"...The armistice conditions must be determined by the military experts of the American and Allied governments. The American government cannot accept any conditions that do not absolutely guarantee the current advantage of the American and Allied forces."</p>
<p>The German government was unwilling to easily submit to the new demands put forward by the White House. The German government naturally did not ignore the sudden imposition of harsh conditions by the United States. Since the United States required the Berlin government to negotiate with the Allied military authorities, it naturally could not object. However, the German government hoped to obtain more favorable conditions from the Allied governments.</p>
<p>On October 20th, the German Prime Minister replied to the American President, "When the German government accepted the conditions for withdrawal and occupation, it advocated that the method of withdrawal and the terms of the armistice should be determined by military advisers, and that the basis for guaranteeing the armistice conditions should be the former ratio of the opposing armies. The German government now asks the President to propose detailed conditions and believes that the American President will not propose requests that are inconsistent with German honor and the conclusion of a fair and balanced agreement..."</p>
<p>Prince Barton's conspiracy could not trap the Allied governments, but the negotiations between Berlin and Washington had lasted two weeks, and now they must be stopped, because their future would only cause disputes and could not make the Germans recognize President Wilson as the arbiter of the Allied governments and Germany and Austria. This situation could only be of a hundred disadvantages and no advantages to the Allied powers, so the Allied military advisers should come forward themselves.</p>
<p>After the Supreme Military Council was established in 1917, the Allied governments had their expert advisers as military representatives permanently stationed in Versailles. Four months later, the Allied Commander-in-Chief was produced, and these advisers became insignificant. But nominally, they were still ordinary consultants of the Allied governments. They were ordered on October 8th to prepare a ceasefire plan against Germany based on this qualification.</p>
<p>The Allied governments must consult their military advisers, but they must also consult with the commanders of each army, who know more about the military situation and the terms of the armistice. They are responsible for authorizing the armistice and directing the war. I made this point in a letter to the French Prime Minister on October 16th.</p>

<h3>I Don't Regret It</h3>
<p>— Hanxin</p>
<p>The violent and barbaric Japan, taking advantage of our country's natural and man-made disasters, sent its ferocious and wolfish army to occupy our resource-rich Northeast. Our authorities watched helplessly as the enemy arbitrarily slaughtered our people, raped our women, and destroyed our cities. If this can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated?</p>
<p>Our patriotic people, hating the brutality of the Wokou and grieving the loss of our territory, were all filled with anger and indignation. They spontaneously rose up to resist. Merchants boycotted goods, workers went on strike, students went on strike, and they organized volunteer armies to be the vanguard of the war and organized petition teams to petition the capital, demanding that the government declare war on Japan. We the people have done what we can. Although our government, in view of the lack of internal unity and the eradication of bandits, is still hesitant, the people's patriotic fervor is not diminished by this, but has become even more intense.</p>
<p>I am a part of the Chinese nation. Now, in the capacity of a small citizen, I offer my ardent heart. In front of compatriots across the country, I will tell you about my weak but conscientious actions in this time of national crisis.</p>
<p>I am an ordinary employee in a Sino-Japanese joint venture. Although I am still young, I bear a heavy burden. The family's economy relies entirely on me. Since hearing the bad news from the three northeastern provinces, I have been depressed all day long. Should I resign, or should I swallow my anger and work under the triumphant form of the Japanese? This question was constantly raging in my chest. If I resign, what will happen to the family's livelihood? Otherwise, how can my conscience be at peace?</p>
<p>I finally couldn't stand the condemnation of my conscience and angrily resigned from my current job. Although the problem of livelihood is gradually pressing me, making me feel infinite pain, I think that sacrificing my personal happiness for the glory of the motherland is sacred and worthwhile, so I don't regret it.</p>
<p>When I was on the job, I often talked with my Japanese colleagues about the Northeast Incident. I certainly defended the weak China, but they also defended their aggressive empire. Sometimes, we even quarreled, which is of course to be expected.</p>
<p>However, while there are many Japanese people with ambitions, there are also some Japanese youths who sincerely sympathize with China. These are of course the clear-thinking ones. Among the Japanese youths I worked with, there was one named Nojima. One morning a few days before I resigned, he and I were sitting in the chemistry lab, each silently looking at the day's newspaper. The newspaper was printed in bold headlines reporting the barbaric behavior of the Japanese army. I was so indignant that I couldn't restrain myself and wanted to leave the place immediately.</p>
<p>But Nojima suddenly spoke to me.</p>
<p>"This incident is really a great misfortune for the people of China and Japan."</p>
<p>I only felt that he was satirizing me triumphantly. I almost wanted to break out and curse him. I said angrily,</p>
<p>"This is completely an act of robbery. Taking advantage of our natural disasters and internal strife, you actually sent troops to invade us, and you still talk about Sino-Japanese friendship, co-existence and co-prosperity, and that we are of the same culture and the same race. This is simply farting!"</p>
<p>But Nojima said calmly,</p>
<p>"That's right, it's all farting. These are all the farts of Japan's warlords, politicians, capitalists, and landlords. But it has nothing to do with us ordinary Japanese people. Anyone familiar with the current social system knows that Japan's invasion of Chinese territory not only causes inhumane suffering to the Chinese people, but also causes suffering to the Japanese people. It's a long story, and you certainly won't believe it. I won't say much, but I have to tell you that I personally hate the atrocities of the Japanese warlords, politicians, capitalists, and big landlords as much as you do. I completely sympathize with China, sympathize with you. Yes, you may think that I am deceiving you at this time, that I am fooling you."</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter if you deceive me or fool me," I said. "I swear from now on that I will never cooperate with you Japanese people again, and I will break off relations with you from now on." My chest was full of anger and there was nowhere to vent it. I said this, and the next day I left the Sino-Japanese joint venture. Although that Sino-Japanese joint venture is still a Sino-Japanese joint venture, although the Eastern Province Incident has no optimistic hope to this day, although I am now suffering from unemployment, however, I do not regret it.</p>
<h3>Professor Master</h3>
<p>— Xian Lu</p>
<p>Whenever Professor Master is mentioned, who doesn't shake his head, understanding his exemplary conduct?</p>
<p>"General Theory of Law" is prescribed as a required course, so although some people are unwilling to study it, there are still quite a few people who choose it under the coercion and temptation of credits.</p>
<p>The law Ph.D. teacher from Paris University in France, Mr. ×, is here to teach. He is wearing a gray serge robe and a black mandarin jacket, with pink-soled satin shoes on his feet. He has a short mustache. He walks into the classroom slowly, waving the "General Theory of Law" book stained with chalk dust in his left hand. When he is still more than ten feet away from the podium, he throws the book forward with a swoosh, and then sits heavily in the lecture chair. He looks down with two eyes.</p>
<p>"×××," he calls names in the lowest voice of his life, and then suddenly raises it and calls the student number "3349". If you don't pay attention, you will think that he is calling "×××·3349", and you will not realize that he is calling two people.</p>
<p>"×× Virtue," his voice is so small that it is almost inaudible.</p>
<p>"Why isn't the beautiful and virtuous lady here?" He seems to turn into a funny face and say,</p>
<p>"Here, sir, I didn't hear you."</p>
<p>"Hmph, didn't hear you..."</p>
<p>It takes twenty minutes to call names once, so he starts to talk about the book.</p>
<p>"Today I...am here...to...talk...about...law," he says in a light tone, as if disconnected. Suddenly he gets especially loud, "What is law?"</p>
<p>The way he talks really makes it impossible for you to understand. Everyone shows their suffering face to face. He seems to understand everything, and says sternly,</p>
<p>"Aren't you listening? This is my Lecture, and I want you to take notes."</p>
<p>Speaking in this way until the end of class, there are not many people in the whole class who can take all of his notes. Everyone has no choice but to complain. The only thing that can be heard in the same tone is,</p>
<p>││Professor Master,</p>
<p>Oh, Professor Master, how can we?</p>
<p>This is really good news. Professor × has not been here for a long time. We really want to shout a thank you to God and bless Mr. ×. Thanks to him for letting us off these days. He has hundreds of millions of family properties, and he also has a beautiful wife and has also served as a "prosecutor". He doesn't have to teach and eat this chalk dust. He can live in seclusion and enjoy himself in the world. However, some people say that Professor Master has gone to be a member of something and is a great master because he still has some fame.</p>
