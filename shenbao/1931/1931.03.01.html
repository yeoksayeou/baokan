<h3>軍縮與軍備增費</h3>
<p>自歐戰告終。國聯會成立之後。各國之當局。無一不日盡力於軍縮問題　以欲預弭將來世界之戰事。必先减少今日軍備之競爭故各海軍國之縮减海軍軍備會議已一再舉行。近且因英相之游歐。而英美日三國之海軍協定。將成爲英美日法意五國。海軍公約之成績。自外表觀之。軍縮事業之進行。不可謂不努力。且明年二月。國聯會將有國際裁兵大會之召集。是軍縮前途誠大可樂觀也。然而據倫敦某報。軍事訪員之調查。謂七十年來。各國軍備之競爭。未有甚於今日者。是其表裏之矛盾。豈不大可驚駭耶。</p>
<p>據其調查。陸軍美國則增三萬餘人。意國則增二萬餘人。俄國則增四十萬人。海軍之巡艦。意國則增四萬噸。美國則增一萬三千噸日本則增十四萬一千噸。海軍中之潛艇。法國則增一萬八千噸。意國則增三千一百噸。美國則增四萬三千七百噸。統計各國所增陸海軍之軍費。約五萬萬餘其言果確所謂縮减軍備實際豈非正在增加軍備也耶。</p>

<h3>英意海軍談判</h3>
<p>因法方之提案</p>
<p>又將陷入僵局</p>
<p>英代表團昨離意赴巴黎</p>
<p>▲國民社二十七日羅馬電　今日上午海軍談判繼續進行、英意兩外相就政治性質上討論、兩國專家則忙於覓商可以令英法意三國海軍界滿意之方式、將午意外相馳報首相墨索里尼後、卽設宴欵待英代表、午後雙方復繼續討論、大約須至星期六午前方能完畢、聞意國對於英法所擬之三國公約、已提出對案若干條、故在切實定議前、英代表有再與法外部交換意見之必要、至會議内容嚴守秘密、但就今日下午情形觀察、似法國所提之某項提議、將有陷入僵局之象、現英方宣稱、不論談判結果若何、將於星期六下午二時起程赴巴黎、</p>
<p>▲國民社二十七日羅馬電　今晚英大使歡宴參加海軍談判之意閣員及專家、意相墨索里尼亦破例赴宴一、外間甚爲驚異、按意相對於此類宴會向不親臨、故此次當係對於英　外海兩大臣表示特别好感、且聞席間與兩大臣談話甚久、又據官廳宣稱、英國外務海軍兩大臣將於明日離意前覲見意王、至談判結果、因尚須商諸法美日三國、暫時不能發表、</p>
<p>▲國民社二十七日巴黎電　此時法政界目光自皆集中於羅馬海軍談判、今日下午發行之晚報評論此事稱、意國顯似欲將全國問題移入政治途徑、而法政界則主張此類條約、純屬專門技術性質、又載謠傳英代表團問外海兩大臣與海軍專委克萊琪意見亦不甚一致、但此訊當然不能徵實、</p>
<p>▲國民社二十七日莫斯科電　俄報評論法英意海軍談判、謂有一般主張干涉俄國者在内活動、法人深忌意俄相親、不惜在他方面讓步、以購致英人之贊助、故預料不久當復有排俄新十字軍出現、惟各報評論絶無一語涉及意國之態度、足見俄政府仍希望意國仍堅持法意海軍均等原則、俾談判之無功云、</p>
<p>▲路透二十八日羅馬電　英意兩國外相與海相之談判、今晨告畢、負責方面發表消息、謂意國於不重要保留條件之下、已承認英外相漢德森從巴黎携來之辦法、苟無意外阻礙、法意兩國可加入美英日所簽之倫敦海軍條約云、英外交家成功之消息、使意國人士大爲滿意、但漢德森與亞力山大之工作、猶未完畢、現將返巴黎、俾作最後之結果、而使三國條約變爲五國公約、查漢德森二月二十三日由倫敦赴巴黎、一日之内、竟使法國依允减少噸數上對意之優勢、旋於二十五日抵羅馬、次日與意當道接洽、前後僅一星期、而此爭執已久之海軍問題居然可望解决</p>
<p>▲路透二十八日羅馬電　英使署發出公報、言英意外相談判事、謂倫敦海軍會議閉幕時尚未解决之問題、現英意兩國在其原則上已有一種協定、其條欵已提交法政府、故漢德森與亞歷山大卽赴巴黎、如法政府無異議、則此協定文將送交英美日及海外自治地政府、因上述政府皆曾參加倫敦海軍會議也、</p>
<h3>世界各國軍備概况</h3>
<p>年需五百萬萬金元</p>
<p>較大戰前幾增一倍</p>
<p>▲倫敦訊、國際裁軍大會已由國聯行政院决定於明年二月召集、而最近數日來法意海約談判、亦頗有接近之趨勢、故歐洲各政治家對裁軍前途多有抱樂觀者、蓋在事實上、七十年來各國軍備爭競、迄今已達極點、若再勉强擴充、實已有力不從心之虞、據倫敦某大報軍事訪員經過詳細調查後報告、現在全世界重要各國除不列顚外、其軍備幾均較一九一三年非特不曾減少、抑且增加多多、統計全世界每年軍備費用、共達五·○○○·○○○·○○○金元之鉅、較之一九一三之三·五○○·○○○·○○○元、約增一·五○○·○○○·○○○元、其中不列顚之國防費、約較從前減三千萬元、但意法美俄等國則平均約各增四五○·○○○·○</p>
<p>○○元、美國在一九一三年共有兵士十萬五千人、一九三一年則已增至一三九··○○○人、意大利一九一三年爲二八○··○○○人、今年增至三○四·○○○人、但法國則由七六○·○○○人、減至四九○·○○○人、英國則由一七四·○○○人、减至一三八·○○○人、至於蘇俄聯邦之軍力、現在己幾與前帝國軍隊同其數額、一九一三年俄軍力爲六九八·○○○人、一九一九年之紅軍僅一○五·○○○人、而今日則已增至五六二·○○○人、至於海軍、意大利自一九一九年來、計增巡洋艦四萬噸、美國增一萬三千噸、日本增十四萬一千噸、而英國則減十二萬六千噸、又潛艇噸位、計法國增一萬八千五百噸、意大利增三千一百噸、美國增四萬三千七百噸、而英國則減三萬二千三百噸、統計五年來、五國海軍人數已增一萬二千人、其中六千人係加入日本海軍云、（世界社）</p>
<h3>英工黨前閣員着手組織新黨</h3>
<p>工業爭端案勢將擱置</p>
<p>▲路透社二十八日倫敦電　前因失業政策不合辭出工黨内閣之摩斯萊氏、現已正式組織新政黨、今日摩氏發表一文、謂渠已得朝野之充分援助、故招請同志並請求資助、俾在下屆總選舉時新黨有候選員四百人、以爭國會議席、又謂渠之新黨、旣不贊成使國内市塲受世界狀况的紛擾之自由貿易政策、亦不贊成保護資本家、損及勞動家與　　者之保護政策、渠之政策、含有保護人羣各方面利益、維持穩固市塲、保持生活高程度、及切實改造之計畫、如以新的經濟機關聯絡海外自治地一條、卽其切實改造計畫之一云、</p>
<p>▲路透社二十七日倫敦電　政府之工業爭端案、現確有擱置之勢、工聯總會行政會已函致首相麥唐納、謂自由黨加於此案之修正文、其影響使工聯運動處於視一八七一年以來任何時代更爲不利之地位、如此修正之案、全非工聯運動所可接受云、衆料政府將抛棄此案、</p>

<h3>萬目睽睽之下雪蝶對簿公庭</h3>
<p>昨日相逢視同陌路</p>
<p>早知今日何必當初</p>
<p>胡蝶要求解約損失費千元</p>
<p>林謂解約後别人可向求婚</p>
<p>林雪懷頓悔前非仍求舊好</p>
<p>胡蝶謂感情已壞難以偕老</p>
<p>丨法官勸和解改期再訊丨</p>
<p>萬目睽睽之電影明星胡蝶與未婚夫林雪懷於去冬雙方發生意見、以致婚變涉訟一案、胡蝶初控於上海地方法院、嗣因被告家住公共租界、以原就被、乃將控案移轉特區地方法院、其間雙方曾經數次試行和解、而結果均以彼此意見相去甚遠、未能成功、延至二月初間、法院已將本案排定開審日期、票傳雙方聽候審理、昨日爲第一次審理之期、前往旁聽之仕女、不下千人、浩浩蕩蕩、實爲空前未有之擁擠也、於上午十一時半起至十二時半止、共審一小時、結果諭令雙方出外和解、改期於三月二十日上午九時再訊、茲將開審時之詳細情形、分紀如下、</p>
<p>▲空前未有之擁擠　本案爲民事訴訟、原定在該院第九民庭審理、昨晨八時許、法院尚未屆開始辦公時間、而專爲是案赴院旁聽者、已絡繹而至、第九庭本甚狹隘、百人猶屬難容、故一刹那間、遂患人滿、庭外之長廊、亦被擠得水洩不通、而後之來者、仍絡繹不斷、俄而嘩　一聲、第九庭門上之玻璃一方、被衆擠成粉碎、該庭推事出人之門、亦爲　衆軋壞、承審是案之周達仁推事、聞悉此種情形、雖覺旁聽者不守法庭之旁聽規則、然以案係公開審問、又未便禁止旁聽、祗得另想别法、</p>
<p>▲改第三刑庭審理　當經周推事再三設法、據報審理刑事之第三法庭、所審案件無多、乃决俟該庭刑事審畢、將是案權移第三庭審訊、蓋其地點甚廣、足容千人以外也、更換庭址之消息傳佈後、專欲旁聽之男女人士、竟如潮水由第九庭汎濫至第三庭、雲時之間、此寬宏之第三庭、頓成人海、項背相望、踵趾相接、直突破特院成立以來旁聽之新紀錄、時纔九句半鐘、蕭燮棻推事所理之刑事猶未訊結、衆人正在盼望之時、</p>
<p>▲胡蝶與乃父同來　雪蝶訟案中之主角胡蝶、已與其父胡少恭及代表律師詹紀　同乘汽車、風馳電掣而來、駛抵院内大門首、相將下車時、鵠候門前之攝影記者、雙手　攝影器具、見胡蝶之倩影、翩然經過、爭相攝取、胡蝶雖亟避之、已無及矣、胡氏早經裁　、而昨則似倍極膏　沐、益覺　　蛾眉、姿　愈妍、御醬黄色直線　藍條子長袍、外罩虎黄色皮大衣、其毛茸茸、足登黑皮鞾、肉色絲襪、牽其父之裾、而隨詹律師從人叢中、姗姗步入第三庭、頓時空氣緊張、千人視線、不期然　注此豸、而彼姝之態度、仍極從容、偕老父坐於法庭左首之證人席、俯首默然、一若有所深思者然、</p>
<p>▲林雪懷到院較遲　胡蝶雖到、而林雪懷猶　來、旁聽者均紛紛探望、而原告代理人亦正在懷疑之時、至十時後、林雪懷始偕其律師鄂森、倪　　、驅車到庭、旁觀者此　以爲雙方當事人俱已齊集、則瞬息之間、將見公庭對簿、各曰理由、及至　推事審畢刑事訟案、宣告退庭、而猶未見周推事升座、於是紛紛談論、或吸烟捲、其實斯時周推事正在第九庭審理其他民事案件、須俟各案　畢、始能更蒞第三庭、故直至十一時半、方與書記官升座是庭、堂下一呼、庭内諸人、咸一致起立、表示敬意、並由庭丁法　傳言不得喧譁、以便審理、</p>
<p>▲司法警力維秩序　但人數旣衆、謹守秩序者固有、而談笑如故者尤多、且所立地位較遠之人、因欲一瞻法宜風采及聆兩這供詞、遂相李高立於座上或　沿、延頸跂踵、如廣塲中之觀　戲法、經法　頻頻揮之使坐聽者藐藐、法官　守秩序、亦置若罔聞、厥後由警長惠丁、　西籍警目警士等數員至庭、將不受指揮之旁聽者、强制命其退去、餘人始各就坐靜聽、秩序得以維持、此種情狀、實較審黄白英案　尤爲熱烈倍蓰也、</p>
<p>▲今日如同陌路人　胡蝶偕乃父胡少貢同坐左首　人席、林雪懷代理律師到庭時、因無坐位、初立于律師坐位前、向其他律師鄂森頻頻詢問「我坐何處」、鄂律師四顧均無隙地、乃命人坐于律師之左邊、適在胡蝶之旁、相距僅咫尺之遥、但坐位雖近、而彼此絶、相應、如同陌路之人、當其兩人在三年前互訂婚約于月宫舞塲之時、卿卿我我、應作如何感慨也、（胡林于十六年三月廿二日在北四川路　宫跳舞塲訂婚時、記者當時亦係　客之一、曾爲攝一影、茲附刋于後、）</p>
<p>▲歲月蹉跎忽變心　周推事升座後、首傳原告胡蝶、訊問姓氏年籍住址、繼訊被告林雪懷之年籍住址畢、乃轉問胡蝶因　對林起訴、由答、因他要求解除婚約、全無理由、（問）此外尚有何事、（答）追還各項欠欵總共三千餘元、計分代購汽車、代借現欵、及欠胡蝶公司　欵等類、（問）還有什麽請求、（答）因被告要求解約、使我名譽精神、皆受痛苦、應令賠償損失洋一千元、（問）此數有何根據、（答）我倆訂婚至今三年、被告倘欲解約曷不早提、茲則歲月蹉跎、忽然變表心、損失誠難計算、現所請求數目甚微、多則深恐被告無力耳、</p>
<p>▲提解約深自懊悔　周推事旋問林雪懷是否訂過婚約、林答、原告控告、實有其他用意、推事以林　非所問、因仍以訂約否訊之、林始　婚約係於十六年三月二十二日訂立、問、有媒妁否答、未有媒人、問、有契約否、答、無契約問、有聘禮否、答、有戒子一只、問、是否汝要解約、答、我對解約事今已非常抱歉、蓋胡女士名譽雖不甚佳、但女士身爲影女演員、應酬交際、在所難免、故我總希望回復原來感情、現在不願意解約、問、當時汝何故有此主張、答因受其壓　過甚、激而出此、今已深自懊悔、蓋當時處於惡劣環境報紙上復有不名譽之記載、問、報載原告何項不名譽事何報所登答小報（報名爲大報）登載她跳舞、及種種不名譽之事</p>
<p>▲解約係何人主動　此時被告</p>
<p>律師倪　　起稱、解除婚約、實係原告主動、原告先向明星公司周　　及、輾轉　諸報章、原告律師詹紀鳳亦起稱、此事究竟由何方主動、稍待當有當面證明周推事續問胡蝶解約事起於何時、答、十二月中、問、汝允否、答、祗須有條件、自當允許、問、何種條件、答、卽還我欠欵、問、解約事汝何由而知、答、他有信來揚出、倪律師復稱、「解約係原告與人言及、遂被登報、詹律師駁之曰登報在後、而被告來信通知在先　隨將林之律師至胡第一信函呈　、推事問林雪懷此信寫於何時答、十二月二十八日問、信内云行止不檢聲名譽藉、有何根據、答、載在小報、此小報今未帶來、鄂森律師乃請求飭傳明星公司經理周劍雲到案、當可證明解約實係原告之主張、詹律師卽稱被告業已以書面表示解除婚約、自較證人之言爲有力似無用傳、周推事因原告所控之解約部份、已得相當之明瞭、遂卽改訊欠欵部份、</p>
<p>▲借欵部份之審理　先問林雪懷欠胡蝶公司之貨欵否、答、非獨不欠、而我之薪水、猶未算淸、然原告公司提出證據證明我欠其貨欵、自當承認、現在我實莫明其妙、詹律師隨卽將賬單支票存根簿等、一併呈　、推事問、代借六百元之事有否、林答、此事約在十月四日胡　我支票一紙、代向銀行取欵、俾其給付製衣工資、　晨、我取得欵項、於午飯時、悉數　之於胡矣、詹律師曰、關於此點、原告可以證明、是日取得六百元後、並在原告處凑足銀五百兩、存於虹口之上海銀行分行、而開往來戸名、鄂森律師提出辯駁、僅及一語、林又續稱、是日因順便以欵存於銀行、並非原告之欵、推事卽訊以　車事件、林答　此車之合同、及所捐之照會、可　證明車爲誰有、車價約七百元、係在法租界亞爾培路安飛車行贖買、詹律師遂向庭上稅、但購車之資、係由胡蝶墊付、有支票存根可稽、是時倪律師忽提出一問題、謂原告所請求者、爲解約與債務兩項、彼是否因債務而欲解約、應　命令原告表示、詹律師則曰、此乃審判長之職權行爲、律師毋庸聲請、至付欵與被告之經過情形、須請庭上對原告加以原諒、蓋欵項概係　父所付給、今其父亦在案、可由其詳述、鄂律師以原告之父旣非證人、又非原告、反對其代表乃女陳述、推事爰命胡蝶將付給林雪懷欵數日期逐一報告、胡蝶遂　呈　之支票存根簿取回、按欵報告林雪懷所用之欵、</p>
<p>▲欠欵細目之報告　計四月十四日三十三元六角、四月十六日三十元、二月十九日五十元、二月十八日二十元、六月三十日二十五元、六月十五日十六元五角、七月八日二十八元六角、四月二十五日五十元、八月二十九日五十元、十一月初五日九十六元四角、十二月十四日二十元、二月二十七日五十元、二月二十五日十一元、二月二十五日三十元五角、五月十三日三十七元、九月五日四十元、九月十五日六十九元一角、九月二十九日一百元、十月初十日、三十二元四角、十　十二日、六十九元一角、十月二十七日、五十元、十月三十日二十元、十一月十五日六十九元一角、十一月初十日三十元、四月五日二十元、五月三十日七十五元、六月二十九日二十元、七月初十日六十九元、八月十五日二十元、二月五日九十六元四角、四月十六日規銀四十兩、十月十八日規銀五十兩零九錢三分、十二月初十日、規銀三十二兩八錢、二月十日、規銀四十兩、</p>
<p>▲未婚夫婦無借據　報告畢續穉以上支票、俱係工商銀行所出該行之總行在香港、上海僅此一分行問、支票由誰簽名答我父親簽的、問此欵是汝所有抑汝父所有答、是我父借給他的、詹律師卽爲聲明胡蝶父女並未分家、推事續問汝代向明星所借之欵有憑據否答其時我正無錢、故向明星借得支票　付被告據言係做標金生意、被告將支票兌欵後、卽往上海銀行開往來戸名　我因彼此係未婚夫婦、未便向其索取借據</p>
<p>▲購汽車分期付欵　問、汽車誰買的答我給資交他買的、所給亦屬支票因購車須訂合同而我不識英文故由被告簽字該車價銀三百八十兩分三期付淸第一期二百兩係八月三十日期票、第二期九十兩係十月初二期票第三期九十兩係十一月初二期票均付與安飛汽車行問借給被告各欵其支票上有記名否答有但有記名者亦有無記名者、</p>
<h3>雪蝶訂婚詩攝影（金華亭攝）</h3>
<p>問其不記名者、何以知由被告所用答票根上、曾經註明故用逾皆可查案問汝製西裝否、答無且我製衣費由我自付支票上之無被告簽字者因係親戚之故鄂律師卽稱、唯其爲親戚關係、被告交還胡六百元未向取收據、現除此項票根外、何以無其他賬簿提出證明林施欠貨欵、而購車合同及汽車照會均署　名　敝律師且曾偕林赴售車之公司調查　惟因其車價已付淸、合同遺失該公司西人願立據證明該車之所有權確屬於林原告頃稱因不諳英文故由林簽訂合同然滬上不識英文而置　車甚多則代其簽名之人皆可據所購之車爲已有寗非怪談、</p>
<p>▲林指胡舌底翻蓮　是時林雪懷向庭上聲言、謂有意見陳述、但渠不善詞令、未能如原告之舌底　蓮、異常動聽、旋稱適閱原告提出支票存根、見其第一欵、卽係付與時事新報之廣告費、由此可概其餘其實原告、因對解約無法抵抗、遂想出此筆、謂我欠債、汚辱我人格使我名譽受損失、然或有所欠、亦不能定但票根上祗有欵數曁日期、便能證明其欵係屬我用所憑者惟彼自批之字而已推事問、原告因汝無故解約要求賠償損失一千元、汝有何意見林答我現在不願解約、希望維持原來狀態、然縱解約而至動由於原告、况其解約後、仍可爲影戲演員、且别人多可自由向伊求婚、（聽衆發　）何損失之有、</p>
<p>▲胡謂林重金輕愛　推事諭原告曰、刻據被告表示、已不願解約、你們相好於前、被告旣悔前此之孟浪、本院之意、亦以和解爲善、胡蝶訴稱我們先前由友誼而訂婚姻被告初固待我甚好、舉凡他人及傭僕所不願爲之事、均樂代我爲之、我心甚悅、故所　得之金錢、極願　其使用、而　用　亦復　當、厥後突聞人言　被告實係將欵浪費、　酒嫖賭跳舞、無所不爲、屢加　勸、省以我之金錢、多係心血精神所換、不應任意揮霍、乃被告匪特不聽、且從此温柔態度、變爲暴戾之氣、我不得不將經濟一項、加以監督、被告愈益變本加厲、實屬使　灰心、方悟其以前之待我好者、非愛我之人品、乃愛我之金錢也、友人聞知、咸來　　、我猶希望其能悔過自新、</p>
<p>▲感情破裂難偕老　詎未幾、忽遞來律師信、提議　除婚約、我復函詢問條件、</p>
<p>彼則不理唯堅决要求解約、聲言恩斷義絶、承庭上勸諭言歸於好、感　莫名、第將來結婚之後、恐仍無良好結果目婚姻大事非同兒戲、彼此感情旣已决議焉能偕老白頭故我實不願復合惟有任彼飛短流長已也鄂律師遂爲被告辯稱、林雪懷前因誤聽　言、致起　曾、自原告與一小報涉訟、林卽深悔前非、敝律師復經所勸以後舞場少去、卽去則夫婦偕往、原告若以往舞場跳舞卽認爲有情侣、亦未免過甚甚　胡蝶績稱、被告要求解約在前、而我與鈴報涉訟在後、何能諉爲信報紙讕言、推事因問鄂律師解約之函發於何日、答、當時被告因見大報（三日刋之大報）所載、卽來委託致函原告、主張解約、敝律師當勸其勿過信報紙所述、被告謂不獨報載、卽明星之周劍雲亦言原告决計解約、故特請先爲函達、敝律師遂依其意旨代爲致書、</p>
<p>▲林雪懷否認用錢　林雪懷最後則稱胡女士所言皆空空洞洞之詞我自十餘歲至今、從未失業、焉用其津貼、而原告未　名時所住僅月租十五元之房屋、亦斷不致有欵給我使用假使我須其津貼者則彼又何故與窮　大爲配偶耶、詹律師亦復繼續聲稱、被告律師頃</p>

<h3>樂華征歐未成之原原本本</h3>
<p>丨英人李思廉不平之鳴丨</p>
<p>英人李思廉滬上足球宿將亦係著名裁判員之一、曾任南洋（卽交大）足球教練有年、爲中國足球隊首先訓練者、茲對於上海及香港西人足球會解决樂華足球隊之業餘問題一事、發表最後之意見、分錄如後、</p>
<p>▲遠征目的正大光明</p>
<p>一九二九年之初、社會民衆咸知樂華體育會、提議組織足球隊、於一九三○年之秋作歐美之游、先赴歐洲大陸諸國及英蘇等國、回國時或將順道兼赴加拿大及美國此行主旨、乃聯絡與賽各國之友誼、而予諸年輕球員良好有益之旅行、且可使歐美各國、一識新中國運動員之豐采已可與他國並駕齊驅、由此推論、今日中國之體育要非彼等平素理想中之不良及落伍者也、</p>
<p>▲赴歐接洽極爲滿意</p>
<p>李思廉君於一九二九之夏、赴英時、樂華體育會職員、卽請李氏與歐洲英國等接洽、待其返滬報告、以定行止、李氏乘其在歐假日之便、與各國體育會接洽、並於離英返滬之前、、親與實際支配全世界足球運動之英國足球總會書記法萊迪克華爾爵士、面商樂華來歐辦法當時曾得爵士口頭上之允准、並徵實樂樂之行動係在業餘運動範圍之内、此外管轄歐洲大陸各國足球運動之大陸協會、亦允以全力贊助、</p>
<p>▲大軍出發種種準備</p>
<p>李氏返國、將其接洽結果、及進行方略、告諸樂華旣獲完全採納之後、乃預定於八月中旬自新加坡出發以期抵歐時、適在足球季節中、先由樂華赴爪哇南洋羣島等比賽、藉以籌募遠征歐美之費用、並挑選香港新加坡及南洋羣島各埠之選手、組成極堅强之球隊、李氏則暫以留滬上、以便與歐洲通訊、待後逕往新加坡、與樂華同船赴歐、</p>
<p>▲香港球會無風起浪</p>
<p>一九三○年八月中旬、各事均已將緒、乃最後一閃間、香港足球會、禁止該會華人球員、不得參加遠征、所持理由、謂樂華已失業餘資格、轉成職業家矣、軒然大波、由是以起、英倫英國總會、來電暫緩進行、俟得香港之所謂職業證據及函件等後、再定行止百事爲之延緩、遠征雄圖、難以久待樂華全軍、乃作返滬之計、</p>
<p>▲天大要事隨意處置</p>
<p>自樂華返滬之後、上海足球會卽有組議特殊委員會之議藉以審查樂華内容及球員業餘資格乃轉輾至五個月之後、直至一月二十日、方見上海足球會在各報披露該會之决議、茲當注意者、該會並未組織任何特殊之委員會、不過似在普通執行委員會中、産生此項重要决議而樂華職員、並未有一人被邀列席陳述此中事實、故其决議若在攝影器中得之耳、且在披露决議之前中華全國體育協進會、早舉行專門委員會、審查一切、公認樂華仍有業餘資格、毫未有職業之行爲、</p>
<p>▲上海球會謝絶說明</p>
<p>上海足球會之决議淆惑公衆聽聞、李氏得樂華職員之同意正式致函西人足球會要求該會對於發表之宣言、加以說明、並出示證據、兩星期後、李氏接得該會覆函内謂該會審查所得之結果、已付諸公、告以爲對於此事、毋庸再行答復、換言之、西人會完全拒絶答復李氏及樂華所要求之說明矣、</p>
<p>▲上下機關主張矛盾</p>
<p>一九三一年（本年）二月七日、字林西報載有消息、謂英國足球總會、已通告香港足球會、彼南華足球會曹桂成與陳光耀及樂華球員、均有業餘資格並未犯有職業之嫌、以後仍可參加一切業餘之球賽、現今兩個全國足球總機關如中華全國體育協進會及英國足球總會、咸已宣告樂華係非職業之運動員、彼地方之機關如上海與香港之足球會、何能加以已成職業之罪名二月十日、李氏又函致上海足球會、請其注意於英國總會之决議、但至今日、李氏仍未得隻字之覆音</p>
<p>▲是非曲直付之公論</p>
<p>今上海足球會、指樂華連背英國總會業餘條例、然中華體育協進會旣宣告未犯職業嫌疑於前、英國總會表示於後、不知該會又可以堅持此種態度、至該會所稱其他各節、實無申辯之意義、惟李氏與樂華、亟願公衆明瞭斯事眞相是非曲直、究在何方、可付之公論、抑上海足球會或樂華足球隊乎、</p>
<p>▲不咎旣往努力將來</p>
<p>李氏非意在反抗上海足球會之行動、但爲顧及樂華令名計地位計、且爲將來中國足球隊及球員計、不得不有此陳述也、李氏深覺樂華以前道德精神之健全、應有今日公正之酬報、其於國家於將來之靑年、咸有良好之影響、而値得贊許也李氏最後之貢獻、願彼不咎旣往、努方於將來、聯合一致、表示中國大國民之精神、塲上與塲外本如一律也、</p>

<p>丨施谷德失敗葛托雷罪魁禍首</p>
<p>昨日申園六千有餘之觀衆誠是喜出望外、眼見眞茹健兒顯身手、逞奇能、一球·二球·三球·大破施谷德軍、以三對一之結果、凱旋而歸、西人會甲組中之首席覇軍、竟爲眞茹學子所敗、天下事之不可逆料、有如此者、雖然、眞茹固以技術上之優越、高佔上風、敵人唯有自嘆不如而已、</p>
<p>▲兩隊英雄……列陣相對</p>
<p>眞茹新陣綫之實力、倍增於前、昨日大破强敵、未始非得力於彼也、戴中鋒缺席、其初不無令人膽寒、所幸中衞綫堅硬可靠、然後前後二部、益能應付裕如、全軍表演均佳、惟守門謝全和左翼陳秉祥二人略差耳、施谷德中堅喬治上半時威風八面、下半時侷促一方、前後恍如二人、最後失敗、咎在内衞葛托雷二次失策也、</p>

<p>▲前鋒得勢……本營失守</p>
<p>眞茹逆風猛撲、有進無退、莊中堅二次迎送、造成無限風浪、施軍反侵、乘林莊二罰再罰之便、深人　地、右内打門、彈向後方、梅洪寳起兵右陲、陳鎭和羅海光互相呼應、敵方守門、不得已二次出關奪球、方告平安、十二分鐘韶光已過、右翼却爾登一脚射門、謝守門俯身抬球、不料飛將軍潘爾登自天而降、由守門手中踢入網内、謝果敏捷、不難化險爲夷也、</p>
<p>▲全軍奮起…一鼓下關</p>
<p>施谷德勝球之後、又有一度奮興、斯時差幸謝守門早有决斷、及時得救、眞茹全軍奮起、羅海光搶出人前、一馬當先、聲東擊西、横門斜過、江馮兩　、遙爲接應、陳梅二將、並駕齊進、球傳中央、羅海光轉交左方、陳秉祥中而越位、陳羅再進、又越位無效、眞茹三次大攻、球初由右部侵人、轉向中央、羅海光出人不意、對門猛射、球出如矢、切柱入網、成一一之對、接後陳鎭和單槍匹馬、誤中守門之手、被其擋出、陳秉祥又孤軍深人、射中門柱、彈回之球、陳鎭和迎之以頭、又被守門接去、上半時、一對一、高下不分、</p>
<p>▲頭臚倒戈……飛渡入網</p>
<p>下半時開場未久、眞茹海洪寳一鳴驚人、首作探門之舉、一球飛向門角、守門躍起撲出、施軍如一字陣、五虎並進、右來爲江擋出、左去由守擊出、敵勢旣退、眞茹又起陳鎭和帶領三軍、打中門柱前後三次、如出一轍、大有神門在此、百無禁忌之概、十五分鐘之後、陳中鋒家球、遠在三十碼左右、忽而提脚攻門、正苦路遥難達、適逢内衞葛托雷頭臚倒戈、觸中後腦、飛向門去、守門六神無主、手足失措、球脚上、假渡内衞頭臚、飛入網中、事出情理之外、觀衆驚奇不已、至時眞茹以二對一占先、</p>
<p>▲罰球一脚……大功告成</p>
<p>比後兩軍由緊入淡、大半光隂、耗在往返之際、如是者十五分鐘、眞茹五將、又在進興、羅海迎身一頂、球向前飛、陳秉祥逐影追至、與内衞葛託雷相衝、球中葛氏手臂、處以十二碼之罰、陳鎭和負全軍使命、主持執行、碰然一脚、應聲入網、施軍兩遭不幸、而中鋒又以復退出、十人應戰、傾師遠出、作背城一戰、眞茹抵抗得力、每多進攻、然以越位失效、結果三對一、眞茹勝、裁判員李特、</p>

<p>余數聞人言、華人於西人創辦之學校中肄業、最易爲西人所腐化。其結果。則甘心　伏於西人之下余曰。不然。在西人學校中肄業。往往爲國際思想而發奮用功。往往欲爲祖國爭光焉。</p>
<p>余表兄程君。肄業於某公學。該校爲工部局所創辦。學生雖皆華人然教員除教國文者以外。悉爲西人。彼曾語余一事曰。某日。英文教員英人某。令學生作英文論文題爲「中國之海盜」。學生知該教員欲以此辱華人。故所作之文章。其意皆謂「海盜者乃一種結隊而刦掠於海中之盜也。世上以英人爲海盜者最多。故沿歐一帶之大西洋。時有盛大之刦案發生。雖西班牙之海軍艦隊。亦不敢駛行於此一帶也。（一八三三年。西班牙海軍爲世界冠。後西與英失和。大戰於大西洋中。英軍大敗。西軍追擊之。途遇英海盜。海盜將西軍擊退。奪掠軍械船隻無數。西軍以是聞英國之海盜。莫不驚心喪膽。英國海軍。遂賴之而稱雄於全球）。夫我國本無海盜。乃因歐美電影輸入。片中皆言歐美之海盜。我國人依樣畫葫蘆、於是亦有海盜發生矣。」該西教員閱而大怒。盡删之而發下。諸學生皆憤而撕之。於是課室之中。盡飛紙舞煞是好看云。</p>

<h3>上週美棉堅漲之由來</h3>
<p>▲利物浦市况堅穩</p>
<p>▲印度政局良好</p>
<p>▲原布需要起色</p>
<p>二十七日紐約電告一週間棉市狀况云、休假前棉價反動後、利物浦市况堅穩、而埃及與印度棉市亦復視前穩定、印度政治消忽令人興奮、美國境内原色棉布之需求亦有活動報告、棉價乃因之而起、本週之初、日人方面之收買爲市塲特色、但十月期貨超過一角二分之上時、日人停購、三月份交割通告共約十二萬六千包、皆爲收買現貨之大公司與合作社所吸收、卽堪薩斯以東天氣陰雨、田事爲之延緩、但一般棉作準備進行較平時爲早、惟極西與台克薩斯州南方不在其内、商家雖不願隨市價之漲起而買進、以爲同業缺方業已大減、而市價有反動之可能、但紡織品貿易狀况起色之景象、使人不敢放出空頭、</p>
<p>▲又訊　市况較前更屬雙方的穩定、買風視前稍弱、現棉需求稍減、國内疋頭貿易、近來聞成交頗多、其價不與棉價之漲起相合、今則稍停滯矣、棉價高雨量足、政府又發給大批賬欵、說者因此遂謂棉田減少、將不若預料之多、茲將週末統計列后、（單位千元）</p>

<h3>藝術界</h3>
<h3>最近的法蘭西文壇　曼如</h3>
<h3>約克斯愛彌兒白蘭須</h3>
<p>（Ｔacques　Emile　Blancle）是一個著名的國家、亦是一個重要的作家、他出版過幾部小說、最近的一部、名呌「愛默列斯」（Ａvmeris）的、却要算是他的最重要的作品、</p>
<p>「愛默列斯」是一部怎樣的作品呢、</p>
<p>有許多人說這是他的自傳、其中的事實就是他自己的事實、譬如書中的主人翁喬治愛默列斯、和白蘭須自己一樣、是巴黎的一個貴族舊世家底後裔、而愛默列斯底父親、一個很有聲望的律師、是使人想起了白蘭須底父親、白蘭須的父親雖然和書中愛默列斯的父親底職業不同、但他是個有名的精神病醫生、兩人的聲望地位是很相似的、而且白蘭須還是近代法蘭西文壇掌故中的人物、因爲莫泊桑晚年患瘋狂病時、他曾醫治過莫泊桑的、此外、還有一點、主人翁和作者一樣、也是個畫家、而且也是在馬納（Ｍanet法圖印象派大畫家）獲得地位前二十年、就欽敬馬納的、所以從這幾點看起來、有人就說這本小說是白蘭須底自傳、可是、這些理由只是一些膚淺的理由、並不能卽因此而斷定這本作品確是自傳的、其實呢、約克斯愛彌兒白蘭須底「愛默列斯、」和别的許多作家底小說一樣、是作家從他的記憶中取出了若干事實來作爲小說底成分、然而這些成分是經過修改和變動的、當然和照事直書的自傳不同、這部小說寫的是一八七零年到一九一四年之間的法蘭西、可以說是一幅有趣的圖畫、</p>
<h3>靑年作家中</h3>
<p>有兩個已經出版了他們的第一二部作品、大凡新進作家們、第一部作品一舉成名之後、第二部作品往往難以爲繼、所以第二部作品底出版、對於靑年作家們、實在是一個艱難而又重要的關口、如果能夠突過這個關口、以後的地位大有把握了、現在我們所說的兩個作家、就都可以說是能夠通過這關口的、他們的家二部作品都得到相當的成功、字琴達壁特（Ｅug</p>
<p>ene　Dabit）床新著是「少路易」（ＰetitLouis）、這部小說、和他的處女作「北國旅舍」（Ｈotel　du　Nord）一樣、情節是非常簡單、在一九一四年的八月、歐戰爆發的時候、小路易看見他父親出去打仗了、他家裏是窮苦的、他只好在家裏作工贍養他母親、幾個月過去了、這幾個月的生活是充滿了不安、欲望、和狂暴、後來他也從軍了、他的生活難苦寂寞的、在一個駐在的地方、他遇見了從前店裏的一個同事、這人底叔父是開妓院的、小路易在晚間就到那裏去工作、洗洗杯盤碗盞、那裏的一些女人都當他同伴看、後來他離開後方、調在前線去了、於是又經歷了一些新的苦難、列了休戰以後、他回到家裏、但到了家裏、舊日的生活又再從頭開始始了、本書的情節、如此而已、事實當然是平凡的、但是把平凡寫得可愛、就是不容易的了、第二個是彼哀·伐萊（Ｐierevery）</p>
<h3>彼哀·伐萊</h3>
<p>底作品、在風格上、是正和宇琴達壁特底相反、他的新著底作風是詩情的、頗有點狂氣的、同時是艱澀而又有趣的、和他的處女作底格調正是一樣、對於愛看有連貫的故事和淸晰的冒險的小說的人、這本書是不適宜的、但對於那些想找到奇特的詩趣的人、彼哀·伐萊底新著却是一部使人欣喜的作品、</p>
<p>巴黎拉打區出身的文學家弗蘭昔司、卡可（Ｆrancis　Carco）、是以善寫拉丁區生活出名的、他最近出版了一部長篇小說、題名「街」（Ｌa　Ｒa）、這部小說底主要物還是挾有浪漫氣性的法國式文藝家、但在題材上、却很是新穎、可以說是一部</p>
<h3>披藍特婁式的小說</h3>
<p>披藍特婁（Ｐirandello）、我們知道是現代意大利以題材新奇著稱的怪誕派劇作家、弗蘭昔司卡可這部新著、取材的奇特就彷彿披藍特婁的劇本、所不同者、卡可所寫的故事尚有現實的情調、雖然新奇、却並不是必無此情、必無此事、所以倒並不使人發生荒誕的感覺、這小說底情節、大略說起來、是這樣的、某著作家邂逅了一個浪蕩女子、因爲覺得這女子可以做一部小說底絶妙題材、他就對她發生了濃厚的興趣、他設法使她愛上了他、使她覺得他對她是個有情意的人、因爲她看出他是比有些男子們關心她所過的那種賣淫的生活、於是他從她和她的生活裏獲得了許多材料、但是一到他計劃中的小說所要用的材料都已經搜齊了之後、他的秘密的目的已經圓滿達到、他對她就失去了興味、雖然覺得自己不應該如此、但到底抛棄了她、蹂躪了她的肉體、同時也蹂躪了她的心靈、結局是不可避免的悲劇、她慘死在一個醫院裏、</p>
<h3>盎特萊馬洛</h3>
<p>（Ａndre　Mlalraux）是法國新進作家中最傑出的一個、他可以說是屬「新浪漫派」的、他的作品是智慧、現世主義、和决絶的虛無主義底綜合、浪漫的情調是顯而易見的、他的新著「御道」（Ｌa　Voie　Ｒoyale）亦是一本這樣的小說、這部書是他預備要寫的一套長篇小說底第一部、這一套小說將來的總名是「沙漠之勢力」「Ｌes　Puissancesdu　Deseld」、顧名思義、這些大概都是帶有冒險意味的浪漫小說了、「御道」寫的是一個名呌克勞特·梵耐克的胆壯的法國靑年、因爲經濟破産在本國不能立足了、就跑到暹羅去、他研究過東方藝術、知道在那從未有人探險過的柬博寨的叢林裏、有一條湮没的古代大道、沿這條大道有許多無人知道的廟宇、這條路就是「御街」、在古代是印度支那各國交通往來的咽喉要道、梵耐克到暹羅去、就是想到沿這條路的叢林裏去探險、他希望在那些廟宇裏發見些古代東方的淺浮雕、將來帶回歐洲、當古玩賣、可以發一筆財、但這是一個含有兩重危險的冒險事業、一則他旣然要深入蠻荒、當然不免要和未開化的士人發生衝突、二則他要將發現的古物運回歐洲、那末和暹羅的法國當局就亦不免要發生衝突、因爲私運古物藝術品出境是嚴厲禁止的、但是這兩層他都不怕、他立意去探險、本來是因爲要嘗嘗冒險和危險的兩種滋味、鬥爭和反抗底不可避免、更加是使他覺得躍躍欲試、在赴印度支那的海船上、他遇到一個旅客、這人年紀比他大些、而且現世的態度比他更厲害、克勞特梵耐克就提議約他同去、答應日後有福同享、有贓同分那人答應了、這一部小說寫到此爲止後事如何、自然要等第二部了、</p>
<p>這部作品之應歸入浪漫主義之下、是因爲浪漫作品底一切特點、它都有、例如、熱情底放縱、反抗的情緒、自身命運的創造、和希冀毁滅的慾望等、都是、書中人物底擺脫了現代的社會、抱首無畏的精神而去創造自己的命運、正和浪漫主義初期的作品突破了古典主義底藩籬而發洩着自由奔放的情緒一樣、所以如梵　克之類的作品可以說是新浪漫主義的作品、不過態度底沉靜、調子底枯燥、類乎自然主義的作風罷了、至於梵耐克文辭底美麗、詩情的描寫底豐富、則又彷彿如唯美派的作品、竭盡纖麗優美之能事、</p>

<h3>Impeachment Power of Supervisory Committee Members of the Control Yuan</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A member of the Control Yuan stated that when a member of the Supervisory Committee proposes an impeachment case, the President of the Yuan will appoint three other members of the Supervisory Committee to review it. If it is deemed that a disciplinary action is warranted, the impeached person should be transferred to disciplinary action. If the Committee on Disciplinary Sanctions for Officials decides that no punishment should be imposed, the original impeacher will not be held responsible. If the review deems that the matter should not be handed over for disciplinary action, but the proposer still insists on the proposal, the Control Yuan should also transfer the impeached person for disciplinary action. If the Committee on Disciplinary Sanctions for Officials decides that no punishment should be imposed, the original impeaching member of the Supervisory Committee should be entitled to the rights stipulated by the Law on the Protection of Members of the Supervisory Committee. Furthermore, if a civil servant is subject to impeachment, there is obvious truth, or has been reported by the people, and the impeachment is intentionally not carried out, then the member of the Supervisory Committee has failed in their duty, and the Legislative Yuan may raise questions to the Control Yuan.

<h3>Reporting of Pardoned Political Prisoners to the Central Government for Record</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government issued an order to the Executive Yuan and the Judicial Yuan on the 27th, stating that the Amnesty Ordinance was originally intended to give political prisoners a chance to reform. However, among those pardoned, it is difficult to guarantee that there are no incorrigible individuals who, after escaping the law by chance, will still tend to be reactionary and change their names to do evil. The Judicial Yuan and the Ministry of Military Affairs should instruct their subordinates to report the approved pardon of criminals by the approving agency to their superior agency for record. At the same time, an excerpt of the case details, along with a photo of the criminal, should be submitted to the central government for record. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<h3>Shanxi Provincial Government Requests Restoration of Financial Public Bonds by Telegram</h3>
<p>(Taiyuan) The Shanxi Provincial Government telegraphed the central government requesting the restoration of financial public bonds. It stated that the livelihood of the people of Shanxi is declining, the value of paper money is plummeting, and the people are uneasy, barely able to survive. They are eagerly awaiting relief. Therefore, it is requested that the central government issue the previously agreed-upon financial public bonds to reorganize the finances. The suspension of the bonds was a measure taken by the central government out of necessity. However, the responsibility for past events lies with others. The suffering people have nowhere to appeal. It should be clear to the central government that the opportunity for survival is now in danger, a hundred times more critical than before. It is requested that the central government grant approval for the restoration. As for the originally designated fund, which has been allocated for military expenses, it should be directed to another source and used as the foundation. The Ministry of Finance should be instructed to review and implement. (Special dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<h3>Shanxi Military Generals Request Military Pay</h3>
<p>Military Conclusion Meeting to be Established Today</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) There are still no clear regulations for the Northeast re-organization fees and the monthly pay for the various units of the Shanxi Army starting from March. The generals believe that the re-organization is about to be completed and funds are urgently needed. They have decided to send representatives to Shenyang again within the next few days to request allocation. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) The Provincial Party Department telegraphed Chiang and Zhang requesting the prompt allocation of military pay for the various troops stationed in Shanxi, and the immediate dispatch of troops to suppress bandits and open up land, so as to avoid local requisitioning and hardship for the people. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) All employees of the headquarters will have their salaries suspended starting from the 28th. The military conclusion meeting is scheduled to be established on the 1st. The original departments of the headquarters will be scaled down, renamed as groups, and handle various military aftermath matters. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) The Li Fuying unit has completed reorganization, with a total of over 200 officers and over 3,000 soldiers laid off. (Special dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The original plan for Shanxi reorganization was to end by the end of February. Starting in March, the salary will be received by the deputy directorate. According to the five armies and ten divisions, plus the railway protection and security forces, there are a total of seven armies and two independent divisions. The monthly salary is 1.8 million, and food and clothing are not included. The total monthly salary and food costs are 3 million. The three national taxes of Shanxi province, namely tobacco, alcohol, stamp tax, and Hedong salt tax, have a total monthly revenue of 500,000. The original monthly Likin tax of 500,000 has been abolished. The unified tax and business tax are less than one-fifth. Statistics show that Shanxi's military expenditure is 3 million per month, not including the arsenal. The revenue is only over 500,000. The Shanxi gentry only knows to urge the issuance of financial public bonds for reorganization, but does not account for the total amount of Shanxi banknotes, which is 60 million. Previously, Yan requested to handle 2.4 million financial public bonds, intending to intercept the national tax of 6 million annually as a public bond fund. Now that the Likin tax has been abolished, the tobacco, alcohol, stamp tax, and salt tax must be submitted to the central government or the deputy directorate. Even if it is not submitted, there is a transfer procedure. The public bond fund is now empty. Even if the public bonds are issued, who would dare to buy them? Currently, the Shanxi Finance Department director has not yet taken office. Thousands of workers in the arsenal are crying out for food. Shang Zhen requested to go to Liaoning to see Zhang. Zhang said that the local area is important and there is no need to come in person. Shang has suspended his trip to Liaoning. Recently, Zhang did not quite approve of Shanxi increasing the number of railway protection and security forces. He said that the original five armies were already financially strained. Increasing the number of two types is equivalent to two armies. This matter was beyond the expectations of the Tianjin talks. Therefore, he cannot bear full responsibility for the Shanxi army's salaries. This is the latest real situation. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<h3>Shanxi Provincial Government Requests the Implementation of Emergency Disaster Relief by Telegram</h3>
<p>(Taiyuan) The Shanxi Provincial Government telegraphed the central government on the 27th requesting the implementation of emergency disaster relief. It stated that Shanxi Province has suffered from continuous years of famine and the people have little savings. After this war, a large army has gathered again. Even if discipline is strictly enforced, the army's hunger is a burden on the people. The supply of grain is exhausted. The people's clothes are thin and the weather is cold. People are dying on the roads. The severity of the disaster is unprecedented. The provinces of Shaanxi and Henan have repeatedly received disaster relief. Although Shanxi does not have obvious natural disasters, it is not a direct battlefield. Applying for relief according to the precedent may be considered difficult. However, the disaster in Shaanxi and Henan is like locusts, which is visible to all. The disaster in Shanxi is like rice borers, which is not easy to know. It is requested that disaster relief be provided to pacify the hearts of the people of Shanxi and forever praise the blessings of the central government. We await your orders with utmost urgency.

<h3>Xiang Yuren Talks About Sichuan Province Construction</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Xiang Yuren, the newly appointed Director of the Sichuan Provincial Construction Department, said that the Sichuan army has reached 500,000 to 600,000, forming a situation of separatism, and losing the authority of the entire government, which has led to the failure of all undertakings. Sichuan is now an exhibition hall for various doctrines. The general youth are influenced by various heresies and often take excessive actions. The main reason is the corruption of education. In terms of transportation, the Chuan-Han Road should be built as soon as possible, and the Tongchuan Line and the Chuan-Dian Line are particularly important. If they are built early, the trunk lines of the inland railways will form a ring, connecting each other and facilitating many aspects. Because he wanted to investigate construction projects in various places, he planned to go to Zhejiang, Guangdong, and North China for a trip. The return date to Sichuan has not yet been determined.

<h3>Qinghai Provincial Government Representatives Host the Press</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Qinghai Provincial Government representatives Wang Tingrui and others hosted a report to the press on the afternoon of the 28th, reporting that after Feng's troops withdrew from Qinghai, Ma Qi used his 15,000 troops to maintain order in the interior and, at the request of the Gansu authorities, sent a portion to Lanzhou, Liangzhou, and other places to prevent banditry. Qinghai's annual income is only 1.5 million, which is not enough to cover military and government expenses. Large-scale construction is even more impossible. Since Ma Qi was appointed acting chairman of the Qinghai Provincial Government, he has been planning and organizing education, industry, and other matters. Being in the remote western frontier, border defense is important, and military training is especially urgent. In the future, it will still be necessary to request the central government to comprehensively plan and provide appropriate support. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<h3>Feng Da Traveling Group Visits Nanjing</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Liaoning Feng Yong University Walking Group visited Yu Youren and Liu Shangqing on the 28th, both of whom wrote inscriptions of commendation. The group plans to visit schools and scenic spots for another day or two, and then leave Nanjing. They will walk along the Beijing-Shanghai line and arrive in Shanghai around mid-March. They also plan to travel from Hangzhou to Fujian, but are worried that the communists in Fujian may not be pacified, and whether they can go will depend on the situation. According to group leader Jin Tiefu, Feng Da's equipment and training have military qualities. The colleagues are used to military life and do not feel tired even after traveling long distances. They encountered bandits when passing through Huai Zhong and Da Wenkou, but fortunately escaped danger. However, after passing through places affected by war, seeing the traces of material destruction and the plight of displaced people, they felt the devastation of war and were truly heartbroken. Upholding peace in the future is the responsibility of our youth. Southern cultural construction is thriving and is a source of academic progress. We are willing to work hand in hand with the youth comrades in South China, encourage each other, learn from each other, and each dedicate our spirit to future undertakings, so that the purpose of this trip will not be in vain.

<h3>Disarmament and Increased Military Spending</h3>
<p>Since the end of the European War and the establishment of the League of Nations, governments of all countries have been making every effort to address the issue of disarmament. To prevent future world wars, it is essential to reduce the current arms race. Consequently, naval powers have repeatedly held conferences on reducing naval armaments. Recently, due to the British Prime Minister's tour of Europe, the naval agreement between Britain, the United States, and Japan is about to become a naval pact among Britain, the United States, Japan, France, and Italy. From an external perspective, the progress of disarmament efforts appears to be vigorous. Moreover, the League of Nations will convene an international disarmament conference next February. Thus, the prospects for disarmament seem very promising. However, according to a survey by a military correspondent for a London newspaper, the arms race among nations has never been more intense than it is today in the past seventy years. Is not the contradiction between appearance and reality shocking?</p>
<p>According to the survey, the United States has increased its army by more than 30,000 men, Italy by more than 20,000 men, and Russia by 400,000 men. In terms of naval cruisers, Italy has increased by 40,000 tons, the United States by 13,000 tons, and Japan by 141,000 tons. Regarding naval submarines, France has increased by 18,000 tons, Italy by 3,100 tons, and the United States by 43,700 tons. The total military expenditure increased by various countries is about 500 million. If the above data is accurate, isn't disarmament in name only a mere disguise for increased military spending?</p>

<h3>British-Italian Naval Negotiations</h3>
<p>Stalled Again Due to French Proposals</p>
<p>British Delegation Left Italy for Paris Yesterday</p>
<p>▲National News Agency, Rome, 27th: Naval negotiations continued this morning. The British and Italian foreign ministers discussed political issues, while experts from both countries busied themselves finding a way to satisfy the naval circles of Britain, France, and Italy. At noon, the Italian Foreign Minister rushed to report to Prime Minister Mussolini and then hosted a banquet for the British representatives. The two sides continued their discussions in the afternoon, which are expected to conclude by Saturday noon. It is reported that Italy has proposed several counter-proposals to the tripartite agreement proposed by Britain and France. Therefore, before making a concrete decision, British representatives need to exchange views with the French Foreign Ministry again. The content of the meeting is strictly kept secret, but judging from the situation this afternoon, a certain proposal put forward by France seems to be on the verge of a deadlock. Currently, the British side claims that regardless of the outcome of the negotiations, they will depart for Paris at 2:00 PM on Saturday.</p>
<p>▲National News Agency, Rome, 27th: Tonight, the British Ambassador hosted a banquet for the Italian cabinet members and experts participating in the naval negotiations. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini also attended the banquet, which was quite surprising to the outside world. It is said that the Italian Prime Minister rarely attends such banquets. Therefore, this time it was to express special goodwill to the British Foreign and Naval Ministers. It is also reported that he spoke with the two ministers for a long time during the banquet. According to government officials, the British Foreign and Naval Ministers will be received by the Italian King before leaving Italy tomorrow. As for the outcome of the negotiations, it cannot be announced for the time being because it still needs to be discussed with France, the United States, and Japan.</p>
<p>▲National News Agency, Paris, 27th: At this time, the attention of the French political circles is focused on the naval negotiations in Rome. Evening newspapers issued this afternoon commented on the matter, saying that Italy seems to want to shift national issues into the political arena, while the French political circles advocate that such treaties are purely technical in nature. It also carries rumors that the British delegation's foreign and naval ministers and naval commissioner Claychi also have inconsistent opinions, but this news cannot be verified.</p>
<p>▲National News Agency, Moscow, 27th: Russian newspapers commented on the naval negotiations between France, Britain, and Italy, saying that some advocates of intervention in Russia are active in them. The French deeply fear the rapprochement between Italy and Russia and are willing to make concessions in other areas to gain the support of the British. Therefore, it is predicted that a new anti-Russian crusade will soon appear. However, none of the newspapers' comments mentioned Italy's attitude, which shows that the Russian government still hopes that Italy will adhere to the principle of equal naval power between France and Italy, so that the negotiations will fail.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Rome, 28th: The negotiations between the British and Italian Foreign and Naval Ministers concluded this morning. Responsible parties released news that Italy has recognized the method brought by British Foreign Minister Henderson from Paris with unimportant reservations. If there are no unexpected obstacles, France and Italy can join the London Naval Treaty signed by the United States, Britain, and Japan. The success of the British diplomats has greatly satisfied the Italian people. However, the work of Henderson and Alexander has not yet been completed. They will now return to Paris to make a final result and transform the tripartite treaty into a five-nation pact. Henderson traveled from London to Paris on February 23. In one day, he persuaded France to agree to reduce its tonnage advantage over Italy. He arrived in Rome on the 25th and contacted Italian authorities the next day. In just one week, the long-standing naval issue is expected to be resolved.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Rome, 28th: The British Embassy issued a communiqué, saying that the British and Italian foreign ministers discussed matters, stating that the problem not resolved when the London Naval Conference closed, now the British and Italian have an agreement on the its principles. Its articles have been submitted to the French government, so Henderson and Alexander will immediately go to Paris. If the French government has no objection, this agreement will be sent to the governments of Britain, the United States, Japan, and overseas autonomous regions, because the above-mentioned governments all participated in the London Naval Conference.</p>
<h3>Overview of Military Preparedness in Various Countries</h3>
<p>Annual Need is Five Billion Gold Yuan</p>
<p>Nearly Doubled Compared to Pre-War</p>
<p>▲London News: The International Disarmament Conference has been decided by the League of Nations Administrative Council to convene in February next year, and the negotiations on the French-Italian sea pact have also been approaching. Therefore, many European politicians have high hopes for the future of disarmament. In fact, the arms race among countries in the past seventy years has reached its peak. If it is forced to expand further, it is already beyond its ability. According to a report from the military correspondent of a major London newspaper after a detailed investigation, the military preparations of all major countries in the world, except for Great Britain, have not only not decreased compared with 1913, but have also increased a lot. According to statistics, the annual military expenditure of the world amounts to 5,000,000,000 gold yuan, an increase of about 1,500,000,000 yuan compared with the 3,500,000,000 yuan in 1913. Among them, the national defense expenditure of Great Britain has decreased by about 30 million yuan compared with before, but Italy, France, the United States, Russia and other countries have increased by an average of about 450,000,000 yuan each. The United States had 105,000 soldiers in 1913, and has increased to 139,000 in 1931. Italy was 280,000 in 1913, and has increased to 304,000 this year, but France has decreased from 760,000 to 490,000, and Britain has decreased from 174,000 to 138,000. As for the military strength of the Soviet Russian Federation, it is now almost the same as the former Imperial Army. In 1913, the Russian military strength was 698,000, the Red Army in 1919 was only 105,000, and today it has increased to 562,000. As for the navy, Italy has increased by 40,000 tons of cruisers since 1919, the United States has increased by 13,000 tons, Japan has increased by 141,000 tons, and the United Kingdom has decreased by 126,000 tons. In addition, the tonnage of submarines, France has increased by 18,500 tons, Italy has increased by 3,100 tons, the United States has increased by 43,700 tons, and the United Kingdom has decreased by 32,300 tons. According to statistics, in the past five years, the number of navies of the five countries has increased by 12,000, of which 6,000 have joined the Japanese navy. (World News Agency)</p>
<h3>Former Members of the British Labour Party Start to Organize a New Party</h3>
<p>Industrial Disputes Are Likely to be Shelved</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 28th: Mosley, who resigned from the Labour Party cabinet earlier due to disagreements over unemployment policy, has now formally organized a new political party. Today, Mosley published an article saying that he has received full assistance from both the government and the opposition. Therefore, he is inviting comrades and requesting financial assistance so that the new party will have 400 candidates in the next general election to fight for seats in the National Assembly. He also said that his new party neither supports the free trade policy that makes the domestic market subject to the disturbances of the world situation, nor does it support the protection policy that protects capitalists and damages the interests of workers and . His policy contains a plan to protect the interests of all aspects of the people, maintain a stable market, maintain a high standard of living, and effectively reform. For example, linking overseas autonomous regions with new economic institutions is one of its practical reform plans.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 27th: The government's industrial dispute bill is now indeed likely to be shelved. The Executive Committee of the Trade Union Congress has sent a letter to Prime Minister MacDonald, saying that the amendments added to this bill by the Liberal Party have made the trade union movement in a more unfavorable position than at any time since 1871. Such an amended bill is completely unacceptable to the trade union movement. It is expected that the government will abandon this case.</p>

<h3>The Executive Yuan Again Cables Anhui Province to Abolish the Salt Surtax and Rice Permit Fee</h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan has now cabled the Anhui Provincial Government to abolish the salt surtax and rice permit fee, and instructed the Ministry of Finance to take note. The telegram reads: Urgent to Anqing, Anhui Provincial Government: It has been found that the provincial government is collecting surcharges on Zhe salt in southern Anhui, Huai salt and Lu salt in northern Anhui, and passport fees for exported rice. Orders have been repeatedly issued to abolish these fees, but they have not been followed, which is contrary to the central government's decrees. Furthermore, Huai salt is sold in Anhui and Henan, and winter is usually the peak season. Since the province added the surtax, salt merchants have been reluctant to move forward, and the national tax loss is substantial. People in dozens of counties in northern Anhui and eastern Henan are worried about eating bland food. The collection of passport fees for exported rice hinders the circulation of food within the country. In Anhui Province, it will inevitably suffer from low grain prices harming farmers. In neighboring provinces that rely on Anhui rice, they will inevitably have to switch to eating foreign rice, allowing rights and interests to flow overseas. Recently, we have received telegrams from merchants and people in various places in Anhui Province, stating that the provincial government has sent troops to collect donations, detain salt and rice boats, seal salt warehouses, and even open fire and kill boatmen. The reports are true, and the handling is particularly hasty. In short, the collection of these two donations by the provincial government is inconsistent with government decrees, and the government cannot approve it. Even if the province's political expenses are insufficient after cutting taxes, it should find other good ways to compensate. I am afraid that the repeated orders from this court to abolish it have not been fully understood. I hereby send another earnest telegram, hoping that you will strive to comply and immediately stop the collection and report it. Concurrently President Jiang [Chiang Kai-shek] (seal).</p>
<h3>Sun Lianzhong's Troops Arrive in Jiangxi</h3>
<p>▲ Sun Will Convene a Bandit Suppression Meeting Immediately Upon Arrival</p>
<p>Nanchang Communication: Sun Lianzhong's troops of the 26th Route Army, upon orders to go to Jiangxi, had their advance troops, Shi Jishu Brigade of Gao Shudong's 27th Division, and the pistol battalion of the 26th Route Army Headquarters transported by boat from Pukou to Xun on the 20th. Shi Brigade, Wang Regiment, and the pistol battalion arrived in the province by train on the Nanchang-Xun Railway on the 26th. The equipment was very complete, and the soldiers were strong and burly. The banner of the 179th Brigade's headquarters, which led the way, was more than twice as high as the flags of other armies, so it was extremely eye-catching. It is reported that Sun's concurrent 25th Division is also moving south one after another. The entire army of two infantry divisions can arrive completely around the beginning of next month.</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>Sun sent a telegram to Chairman Han of Shandong yesterday, with the words "meet and teach the bandits remotely." Also, Sun's telegram on taking over the bandit suppression office in Jiangxi has also arrived in the province. Sun should be able to arrive in Jiangxi in the shortest possible time. All sectors of the province are now preparing to welcome him. According to military sources, He Yingqin plans to convene a bandit suppression meeting immediately after Sun arrives in Jiangxi. Lu Diping, Han Deqin, and Liu Yi are all in the province. Tan Daoyuan, Ruan Zhaochang, Gong Bingshen, and also arrived in the province to visit He. Wang Jinyu and Hao Mengling are all about to arrive. Generally, after the meeting, the general offensive order will be issued on the entire line. (February 26)</p>
<h3>Baron Okura Arrives in Shenyang</h3>
<p>Shenyang Communication: Japanese industrialist Kihachiro Okura's investment in Northeast agriculture, mining, industry, and commerce amounts to more than 100 million yuan. After Okura left Shenyang, his son, Baron Kihachiro, succeeded him in managing the business. In the spring of the year before, he came to Manchuria for the first time from Japan to inspect the business and participate in the 20th anniversary of the Sino-Japanese joint venture Benxi Lake Coal and Iron Company. He first visited Deputy Commander Zhang Xueliang in Shenyang, and both sides had an extremely cordial and harmonious exchange. Zhang also invited Okura to visit Shenyang at the beginning of this year. In order to fulfill his previous appointment, Okura arrived in Dalian from Japan at the beginning of last month, stayed for more than a month, and arrived in Shenyang from Dalian at 3:30 p.m. on the 24th of this month. Zhang sent Yang Zhengzhi, the director of the Bian署 adjunct's office, Tao Shangming, the Japanese secretary, Cao Chengzong, the secretary sent by Wang, the special envoy for foreign affairs, Hayashi Kyujiro, the Japanese consul general, Kasakawa, the police chief, Noguchi Tanei, the chairman of the residents' association, and others all went to the station to welcome him. The people who came to Shenyang with the General Assembly included Mr. Kono, the former representative in Shenyang. They all stayed at the Shenyang Hotel. At about 6:00 p.m. that night, they went to visit Deputy Commander Zhang. It is reported that Okura came here because the expansion of the mining area of the Sino-Japanese joint venture Benxi Lake Coal and Iron Company has been under discussion for a year, but no result has been achieved. He needs to ask Zhang for a solution. The mining business is quite developed. Although it is called a Sino-Japanese joint venture, the Japanese side has much more control and has long exceeded the mining area stipulated in the Sino-Japanese contract. Last year, the Liaoning Provincial Government fined it 1 million yuan for this matter. Okura will stay in Shenyang for about a week. (February 24)</p>
<h3>The Harbin Relief Plan is Determined</h3>
<p>▲ Issuance of 21 Million Harbin Foreign Vouchers</p>
<p>▲ Used Exclusively to Purchase Soybeans to Maintain Commerce</p>
<p>Harbin Communication: At 2:30 p.m. on February 23, the Special Zone Administrative Chief Executive's Office convened various organs and organizations inside and outside the Daoli district to discuss ways to relieve Harbin City. Zhong Yu, the director of the Binjiang Municipal Preparatory Office, Li Kewen, the Binjiang County Magistrate, Gao Qidong, the director of the Binjiang Public Security Bureau, and organizations including the Daoli City Chamber of Commerce, the Daowai County Chamber of Commerce, the Grain Exchange, the Money Industry Association, the Oil Mill Association, the Flour Mill Association, the Grain Industry Association, and more than 20 representatives from banks such as the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Three Eastern Provinces Bank, the Frontier Industry Bank, the Yongheng Bank, and the Guangxin Bank attended. Zhang Jinghui presided over the meeting. Zhang first said that the plan to relieve Harbin City had been previously submitted to the financial conference in Liaoning, but was rejected by the public for fear of affecting the finances of the three provinces. It has now been decided to issue an additional 21 million Harbin notes, which, together with the 39 million yuan issued by various banks before, will make up a total of 60 million. The newly issued notes will also be stamped with the seal of the Supervisory Officer of the Chief Executive's Office to show caution and restriction. In the future, the exchange rate will not exceed 25 yuan at most. Within 25 yuan, all banks and exchange houses are allowed to accept and remit without restriction. If there is any high price, it will be severely punished once it is found out. If the Harbin notes become scarce due to the increase in the amount of notes issued, the banks will sell their existing silver to recover the Harbin notes and raise the price. When Zhang said this, the banking industry stated that they had sufficient preparations and would never allow the issuance of Harbin notes to affect the market. Representatives of various organizations asked about the use of the newly issued Harbin notes. Zhang Jinghui immediately explained that it would only be used to purchase soybeans and would not be used for other purposes. The representatives thought the method was complete and left the meeting satisfied. The issuance of the new Harbin notes will be realized within the month. The original holders of the right to issue Harbin notes were the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Three Eastern Provinces Bank, the Frontier Industry Bank, and the Guangxin Bank. This time, the Yongheng Bank was added. The amount of issuance for each bank is determined as follows: Yongheng Official Bank 5 million yuan, Three Eastern Provinces Official Bank 5.5 million yuan, Frontier Industry Bank 3.5 million yuan, Bank of Communications 500,000 yuan, Bank of China 1 million yuan, and Guangxin Official Bank 5.5 million yuan. In the past, before the Harbin notes were stamped with the seal of the Supervisory Officer, various banks and exchange houses issued them indiscriminately and engaged in ancillary industries. The total amount of notes once reached more than 70 million at most. At the same time, the foreign exchange rate also rose to more than 40 yuan per 100 yuan. This time, 21 million will be added, which is not much different from the circulation amount when it was not stamped. Although the authorities say that they will try their best to maintain the exchange rate and prevent it from exceeding 25 yuan, it is feared that it will be difficult to achieve in practice.

<h3>The Movement of Various Armies Under the Supervision of Jiangsu and Shandong Provinces</h3>
<p>Xuzhou Communication: Wang Jun, the garrison commander of the Jinpu Railway, previously issued a notice to various departments stationed along the Jinpu line, asking them to report on the actual strength of the defense zone. It has now been completed. However, it is necessary to have an overall plan for the future distribution of the defense zone and the garrison matters. It is specifically scheduled to convene a Jinpu Railway garrison meeting in Xuzhou on the 28th, and each division has been telegraphed to send the chief of staff or the director of the staff office to attend. At the moment, Zhang Lisheng has telegraphed back to send Cheng Songqing, the director of the staff office. Chen Yaohan has also telegraphed back to send Sun Yixin, the chief of staff, to attend in Xuzhou. Wei Lihuang replied that he could also arrive in Xuzhou within a few days. Currently, Wei's 45th Division is stationed in the Bengbu section, and Zhang Lisheng's Cavalry 2nd Division is stationed in the Bengbu, Chuzhou, and Guzhen sections north and south. Wang recently telegraphed to the headquarters, proposing that Chen Yaohan's division stationed in Yizhou be transferred to take over the defense of Lincheng and Tengxian. The 29th Brigade Li Hanzhang Department of Han Fuju's department originally stationed in Lincheng was ordered to take over the defense of Jining. The troops sent by Chen's division to Linsheng have already arrived in Zaozhuang temporarily, waiting for orders to take over the defense of Linteng. Also, Wang is currently inspecting the troops of the 7th Division in Xuzhou, and it is almost completed. He will go to Haizhou on the 27th to inspect the troops of the 12th Division and return to Xuzhou on the same day to attend the garrison meeting on the 28th. It is reported that there will also be a new regulation on the defense between Puteng on the Jinpu Line. (February 26)</p>
<h3>The Twists and Turns of the Hunan Army's Reduction</h3>
<p>▲ Dai Huiyuan Disagrees with the Reduction</p>
<p>▲ But He Has Already Left Changde for Hankou</p>
<p>Yangtze River Communication: Because He Jian owes a huge amount of more than 5 million yuan in military expenses in Hunan Province, he is doing his best to reduce the army to maintain it. He previously issued a reduction order, totaling the cancellation of the 9th and 10th Independent Brigades, the Xiangxi Bandit Suppression Command, the Column Headquarters, the First and Third Bandit Suppression Battalions, and the name of Independent Regiment, which can save 100,000 to 200,000 yuan in military expenses per month. However, Dai Huiyuan, the commander of the 10th Independent Brigade and the commander of the Xiangxi Bandit Suppression, originally had two regiments under his jurisdiction, He Ying and Xiang Keqiang, and Li Guojun's Column Headquarters. This reduction, He Regiment was編制into the 16th Division's teaching regiment, Xiang Regiment was into the 31st Division's 3rd Brigade 5th Regiment, and Li's troops were into the 15th Division's 44th Brigade. Although the names have changed, their positions have not shaken. Only Dai Huiyuan alone was relieved of his duties as brigade commander and commander of the Xiangxi Bandit Suppression and transferred to be a counselor of the General Headquarters. Dai's troops are all in Fengzhou to suppress He Long. Dai himself led a special service battalion to guard Changde. On the evening of February 19, Dai suddenly led the entire special service battalion out of the west gate. On the morning of the 20th, the Changde area was greatly shocked, thinking that Dai's troops had rebelled. At the same time, Dai's command post was robbed by scattered soldiers, and officers and soldiers in Dai's troops and their families fled one after another, and order was almost disrupted. Tang Youyue, the magistrate of Changde County, Li Houkun, the director of the 19th Division's garrison office in Changde, and Hu Kun, the commander of the Changtao-Han three-county regiment defense, rushed to send regiment soldiers and standing troops to the streets to suppress them before order was maintained. At the same time, they jointly issued a notice to reassure the people, which read: "According to the report, Dai's troops have left Changde. The local government has sent standing troops and the garrison office of the 19th Division and the command of the Changtao-Han regiment defense area to be jointly responsible for maintaining the security of the city and the officials and subordinates of the department. Anyone who spreads rumors to confuse the public or infringes on the officials and subordinates of the department will be dealt with by military law once they are captured. This is hereby announced, and all must comply with it and not violate it." It was not until after 1:00 p.m. that the people's hearts began to settle down. On the same day, Magistrate Tang summoned the responsible personnel from the military, police, regiment, and other circles and held a security meeting at the county government. It was immediately resolved that (1) the county government's standing troops would be responsible for guarding the city, (2) the soldiers of the 19th Division's garrison office would be responsible for inspecting hotels and patrolling the streets, (3) any army, without orders, would not be allowed to enter the city, and (4) He General Commander would be telegraphed to rush to send troops to Changde to take over the defense. Before the troops taking over the defense arrived in Changde, Tang County Magistrate, Director Li, and Commander Hu would consult and handle matters related to security at any time. Therefore, order was slightly restored.</p>
<p>He Jian paid great attention to the report of Dai Huiyuan's escape. In addition to flying the entire Tao Liu Brigade of the 19th Division from Cha You to the province and transferring them to Changde by car to take over the defense, he also telegraphed various counties in Xiangxi to investigate Dai Huiyuan's whereabouts. On the 21st, he received a secret telegram from Taoyuan County, stating that Dai Huiyuan had arrived in Taoyuan, and Dai also telegraphed his troops He Ying, Xiang Keqiang, Li Guojun, and others to concentrate in Taoyuan, which was about to change, etc. According to the report, He Jian immediately issued three telegrams: (1) A circular telegram to various troops in Hunan Province, stating that those who destroy the reduction order or take extraordinary actions will be dealt with by military law. (2) A secret telegram to Li Jue, the commander of the 19th Division, Zhang Ying, the commander of the New 11th Division, and Chen Quzhen, the commander of the New 32nd Division, to strictly prevent Dai's troops from taking extraordinary actions and strictly stop them. (3) Order Tao Liu Brigade of the 19th Division to rush to Changde at night without delay. In general, everyone was deeply afraid that He Ying, Xiang Keqiang, Li Guojun, and other troops would be incited by Dai, but fortunately, He, Xiang, and Li were not moved by Dai and telegraphed to the province one after another, expressing their sincere support for the reduction order, and all took up the positions of the newly appointed brigade and regimental commanders in Fengzhou. Dai Huiyuan then said that his troops obeyed the reduction order and refused to go to Taoyuan to gather, so he could not do anything. On the 22nd, he quietly left Taoyuan and went to other places secretly. On the 23rd, Dai Hongxun, the chief of staff of the Xiangxi Bandit Suppression Command, telegraphed to He Jian from Taoyuan, saying that Dai Huiyuan had gone to Hankou for medical treatment due to illness, and the special service battalion under his command was waiting for orders in Taoyuan, and it was proposed to return to the establishment of He Regiment, and there was no abnormal movement. The rumors about Dai in Changde were actually a misunderstanding. On the same afternoon, Taoyuan County Magistrate Ouyang telegraphed to report that Dai had left the county to go to Hankou, and the special service battalion under his command had gone to Chenzhou, and the local area was peaceful. As for the entire Tang Xinzhao Regiment of Tao Liu's troops, they arrived in Changde at noon on the 23rd to take over the defense. The twists and turns of Dai's troop reduction came to an end here.

<h3>Wuhu Quick News</h3>
<p>▲ After Anhui Province created levies for rice certificates and surcharges on salt by the jin (unit of weight), Anhui people repeatedly opposed them. The central government also issued telegrams to stop them. However, to raise funds for government expenses, the provincial government continued to collect them. Regarding the rice certificate levy, when officials and merchants were deadlocked, rice transported out of Wuhu by steamship was temporarily recorded by the General Auditing Office for Rice Transport by Steamship in Anhui. Recently, as the office received a telegram from the Department of Finance ordering collection according to regulations, it has now implemented the collection of a donation of four jiao per shi (unit of volume) of rice exported. As for the salt tax surcharge, it is two yuan per shi in southern Anhui and two yuan and four jiao in northern Anhui, and offices have long been established to collect them. However, after the central government abolished likin (internal transit tax), it decided to unify the salt tax, with the central government taking over the collection of salt jin surcharges from all provinces starting from March 1. It also issued a circular to all provincial governments, ordering them to comply with the arrangement of the central government allocating a certain amount of subsidies to each province on average each month based on the future collection amount. The Anhui Salt Monopoly Bureau also repeatedly received urgent requests from the Ministry of Finance to have the Audit Office take over the collection and remittance of the Anhui salt jin surcharge and the price increases for Jiangsu and Anhui, starting from March 1. To maintain the unification of the salt tax, the Anhui provincial government recently telegraphed the Salt Monopoly Bureau to comply with the ministry's order and implement the handover on the first of next month.</p>
<p>▲ Communist bandits in Jiangxi Province have been harassing the border of Anhui. Chen Tiaoyuan previously telegraphed the 57th Division stationed in Wuhu to dispatch the entire Third Battalion of the 341st Regiment to Yin Jia Hui to defend against them. They scattered the fleeing bandits. Now, the battalion has received orders to return to Wuhu today, leaving only one company to garrison. Furthermore, the Yu Fengrun unit of the 342nd Regiment of the division stationed in Guangde has now received orders to depart for Wuhu and then proceed to Hefei to garrison and intercept mutinous soldiers from Liu'an.</p>
<p>▲ Yesterday, the Wuhu Local Court escorted four bandits sentenced to death – Liu Xisan, Chen Ruilin, Deng Hongtao, and Wang Youyi – to the Beiping Road outside the Thirteen Arches to be executed by firing squad. (January 27)</p>

<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Theft of Funds Leads to Suicide in Wuxi: A man named Yuan Siguan, 24 years old, was from Beikuzhen, Bachixiang, Suzhou. He had collected silver dollars at home and traveled to Suzhou to purchase embroidered goods wholesale to open a Shenpao (god robe) store in the town. After arriving in Suzhou, he stayed in Room 7 of the Yi Da Inn outside Tumeng. That night, Yuan happened to meet Shen Erguan (a 35-year-old local man) whom he had known from his time working at the Jinchangsheng store in Shengzezhen. They stayed at the inn together. Unexpectedly, the next morning, Shen Erguan, seeing that Yuan Siguan was sound asleep, stole a leather suitcase that Yuan had placed beside his pillow (containing 135 yuan in banknotes) and left. When Yuan discovered the theft, he immediately took a car to Wuxi, searching everywhere for him, but to no avail. Around 5 PM the day before yesterday, Yuan Siguan passed by the Wu family’s outhouse by the river at Lihuangni Bridge inside the Old North Gate, and suddenly had a death wish. He took off his belt from his waist and hung it on the beam of the outhouse, hanging himself. Fortunately, a passerby discovered him, took him down, and gave him first aid, gradually bringing him back to consciousness. Later, the owner of the outhouse, Wu Yushu, learned about it and, feeling sorry for Yuan Siguan, generously donated nine yuan and four jiao. Meanwhile, Gao Chongshan, the Chief of the First Public Security Sub-bureau in charge of the area, dispatched police to take Yuan to the bureau. Yesterday, Chief Gao dispatched police officers again to send Yuan back to Suzhou, handing him over to the Cangqu Public Security Sub-bureau to inform his family to come to Suzhou to take him back, to prevent further accidents.</p>
<p>Investigation of Nantang Boat Accident Concludes: The Houchi-class steamship of the Taili Steamboat Company capsized near Nanshuixian Temple on the 14th, resulting in the drowning of ten passengers. After the County Public Security Bureau transferred the case to the County Court, the Prosecutor's Office implemented an investigation, detaining Yang Xiangqi and two other managers of the company for interrogation. At the same time, the families of the victims organized a joint association, held meetings, and hired lawyers to pursue litigation. Now, the County Court Prosecutor's Office, based on the accusations from all parties and after interrogating Yang Xiangqi, has concluded the investigation. Yesterday, it transferred the entire case to the Trial Division to file a public prosecution. The Trial Division has also issued summonses, scheduling a hearing for February 2, and separately summoning the five bereaved families who have filed lawsuits: Mi Zhu, Yang Qiaoquan, Gu Dechang, Yang Baiquan, and Wang Longguan. In addition to hiring lawyers to file lawsuits with the County Court, the Bereaved Families Association has also submitted petitions to the Ministry of Transportation, the Provincial Government, the Department of Construction, the County Government, and the Construction Bureau, requesting relief and asking the County Party Headquarters to uphold justice and provide assistance.</p>
<p>Inquiries by Telegram Regarding Methods for Smuggling Rice Exports: Since the government explicitly ordered the abolition of likin, tax checkpoints in various places have long been abolished, and ships traveling back and forth have passed without obstruction. However, some unscrupulous merchants have taken advantage of the opportunity to smuggle white rice exports, causing rice prices to gradually increase. Huang Chengji, the captain of the Ninth Team of the Second Water Police District, believes that Yixing Wuxikou Hetanggang and other places under his jurisdiction are located at the junction of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, which has always been a shortcut for unscrupulous merchants to smuggle. Recently, since the abolition of tax checkpoints at various lake ports, rice ships have been exporting one after another. As there are no explicit regulations prohibiting this, he did not dare to intercept them without authorization. Yesterday, he sent a letter to the Yixing County Government and submitted a request to Mao, the District Chief of the Second District, for instructions on how to handle the matter. District Chief Mao immediately telegraphed the Civil Affairs Department to request instructions.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Jiangyin Riot Police Kill Bandits: Jin Qingxian, head of the Jiangyin Sixth District Security Regiment, and Yin Geng, chief of the Sixth Branch of the county’s Public Security Bureau, set out on the 26th with armed police to suppress bandits. Zhang Jinbei, a notorious bandit from the county, fled to Shuangwenkou in Weifeng Township, the Fifth District of Wujin. He was killed by the police, and his body was left on the roadside. Since that area is under the jurisdiction of Zheng Tianqiao’s Fifth Public Security Branch of Wujin, Chief Jin, and others went to the Fifth Branch to report and request transfer for official inspection. They also handed over another captured bandit, Qu Shunjin, to the Jiangyin County Government for interrogation. Zheng Liuqiao’s Fifth Public Security Branch reported the matter to the Main Bureau on the 27th, requesting the County Court for official inspection. On the morning of the 28th, Chief Prosecutor Yang Kongyi led officials to conduct the inspection for verification and processing.</p>

The bandits fled with their loot.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Provincial Committee Auctions Zhang Cha's Assets as a Traitor: Zhang Cha, a native of the county, was charged with colluding with the enemy and local thugs in 1927. The Special Criminal Court requested and obtained the approval of the Provincial Government to issue an arrest warrant and confiscate all his property. Recently, Zhang Cha, in Dalian, presented a request to the provincial and central authorities to invoke the New Year's amnesty for the release of his property, but it was not approved. After deliberation, the Provincial Government decided to allocate 60% of the confiscated property to the province and 40% to the county for educational and charitable purposes. On the 27th, Zhang Fengzhou was sent from the Provincial Committee to Jinlai Tong to jointly auction off the property with County Magistrate Zhang. After investigation by the County Government, the value of the property in 1928 was estimated at 633,060 yuan. After deducting 108,605 yuan of disputed funds, the actual total was 524,455 yuan. It is still necessary to re-estimate the value this time.</p>
<p>Thorough Investigation of Irregularities in the Collection of Mang Cao Taxes: The personnel involved in the collection of Mang Cao taxes in Tong County were reported for irregularities.

Pan Rongfu was then questioned: "Did Chen Bingquan order you to pick up the opium?" Pan said no. The interrogator questioned him, stating that the facts were obvious and denying them was useless. Then, Qiu Zanqing was asked: "Is the opium yours?" Qiu stated no. The interrogator said that even if the opium was not yours this time, you have also been involved in relief work before. The court concluded that the investigation of the case was now completed. They were scheduled to rule on the 27th. The three were returned to custody.</p>
<p>Communist Xu Hongying's Surrender Deemed Inadmissible: The County Reorganization Committee, based on Xu Hongying (Xu Zhensheng) inadvertently joining the Communist Party, requested to surrender. At yesterday's meeting, it was found that Xu's case did not meet the legal requirements for Communists surrendering. The request was deemed inadmissible. Also, the Communist Chen submitted a request stating that he was innocently arrested, pleading for the case to be dropped and to be spared from injustice. How should this be handled?

<p>Correction of Names for Long-Distance Telephone Numbers in Various Counties: The Department of Construction, based on a report from Deng Fupei, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Electricity Management Office, stated that the names of county-owned long-distance telephones in various counties were inconsistent and could easily cause misunderstandings. The Department heard that in addition to changing the names to "County Town Rural Telephone of [County Name]" and filing a report with the government for record, and instructing for notification, they specially notified the county magistrates, the Construction Bureau, and the Construction Office of each county yesterday to be aware.</p>
<p>Change of Standing Committee Member of County Party Headquarters: Wu Lianqing, a standing committee member of the County Party Headquarters Executive Committee in this county, resigned due to personal matters. The committee approved his resignation at a standing committee meeting and elected Jing Nian to succeed him.</p>
<p>Clearing Village Headquarters Approves Bandit Surrender: The Jiangsu Clearing Village Headquarters believes that among the bandits in various counties, many were wrongly induced or coerced. If they were not allowed to surrender, they would never have a chance to reform. Therefore, in accordance with Article 17 of the Clearing Village Regulations, it drafted nine articles of interim measures for handling bandit surrenders in Jiangsu Province. It requested the Provincial Government to discuss them. The Provincial Government presented them to the 372nd meeting, which resolved to approve them, consult the Pacification and Supervision Office for joint issuance, and report them to the headquarters for record. Therefore, the Clearing Village Headquarters specially notified the Clearing Village Bureaus of various counties yesterday to instruct all Clearing Village Sub-bureaus to follow them accordingly.</p>
<h3>Rugao</h3>
<p>The Smuggling Suppression Camp Reorganized into an Army Battalion: The Rugao Smuggling Suppression Camp was ordered yesterday by the Smuggling Suppression Headquarters to be reorganized into the Second Battalion of the Army.

<h3>Fengxian</h3>
<p>Prohibition of Political Police Extorting Money from Gambling and Opium Dens: County Magistrate Shen Qingchen discovered that some lawless political police were using the pretext of secretly investigating gambling and opium dens to extort money outside. Therefore, in addition to issuing a public notice prohibiting this yesterday, he also stipulated the following measures: (1) All reports of opium addicts or private opium sellers, as well as substitutes and all criminal offenders, must be signed and sealed by the reporter and include their place of origin and occupation, and have a reliable shop guarantee; otherwise, they will not be accepted. (2) The political police handling the case must wear badges and be issued official credentials by the County Government. Anyone falsely using the name or extorting money will be allowed to be arrested and reported for punishment. All fines for gambling and opium dens will have official approvals and will be announced and published at the end of the month. If there is any embezzlement or omission, it can be reported to the County Government to ensure accuracy.</p>
<p>Divorced Daughter-in-Law Leaves, Son Returns to His Clan: Zhang Qing, a farmer from the 39th Tu of the Eighth District, had no son. Seven years ago, he recruited Ruan Dasheng from the same Tu to marry his eldest daughter, Baoyun, to continue his lineage. However, after the marriage, the daughter suddenly disliked her husband's appearance and firmly refused. Zhang was forced to marry Chen Qiaozhen, the daughter of Chen Yuan from the 40th Tu, as a substitute. She was married in the first month of last year. At that time, Dasheng showed no dissent on the surface, but since his wife was not his original spouse, he harbored resentment in his heart, leading to conflicts in the family. Since Zhang Qing himself now had a biological son, his treatment of Dasheng became increasingly poor, leading to a widening gap between the two parties. Now, Dasheng's new wife has fled due to abuse from her parents-in-law. At the same time, Dasheng wants to divorce her. Therefore, on the 28th of last month, relatives and friends gathered the two parties for negotiation. An agreement was reached that they would separate. Zhang Qing was responsible for finding another wife for Dasheng. Dasheng suddenly indicated that he would not recognize anyone except his original wife’s biological daughter. Since Zhang's daughter had already been married off, the clan mediated again. As a result, since Dasheng did not want to take the surname, he drew up an agreement yesterday to return to his own clan. In addition, Zhang posted 80 yuan as expenses for returning home and completing the marriage.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>Smuggling Suppression Soldiers Smash Public Security Sub-bureau: On the afternoon of the 24th, soldiers from the Smuggling Suppression Camp stationed in Wenyan were arrested by police from the Wenyan Public Security Sub-bureau for gambling. Unexpectedly, the soldiers refused to accept this and used the entire camp to directly enter the Public Security Sub-bureau, destroying all the desks, chairs, beds, furniture, doors, and windows in the bureau. The local scholars mediated unsuccessfully. Director Du Weiguo immediately reported the incident to the County Public Security Bureau. Yesterday, a large number of police officers were dispatched to investigate. The soldier Wang Xianzeng was taken to the county for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Hefei</h3>
<p>The Devastation of the Liuan Mutiny: It is said that the troops of a certain division stationed in Liuan Gui'an were instigated by bandits and communists to mutiny on the 28th of the last month of the year. They first rushed into the chamber of the battalion commander and firmly requested two months' salary. The battalion commander replied that the authorities had only issued one month's salary and that if they wanted two months, he would have to borrow from the local government. The mutineers refused and shot the battalion commander, wounding the brigade commander. They then dispersed to loot along the streets. None of the homes of middle-class people or above were spared. The goods in the shoe and sock stores were completely taken by the mutineers. The looting lasted for a day and a night. It was not until the eve of the new year that they bundled up their stolen goods and fled out of the west gate towards Jinjiazai. Afterwards, the four major teams of the Liuan Security Regiment - Yang Songshan, Liu Xiushan, Zhu Menggong, and Quan Liting - maintained order. Fearing that the mutineers would return, they kept the city gates tightly closed. They were not opened until four days after the Spring Festival. It is said that Liuan has been broken into by bandits and communists three times. This is the fourth devastation.</p>
<p>Letters</p>
<h3>Letter from the Relief Committee of Xiushui County</h3>
<p>Yesterday, I read in the "Important Telegrams" section of your newspaper on February 10, a special dispatch from Changsha on the 8th, stating that there were bandits in the Manjiang Shankou area of Xiushui County, Jiangxi Province, numbering about 3,000 and claiming to be 5,000, attempting to attack Xiushui City. On the 5th, our teacher Hao Mengling gave them a head-on blow, killing many bandits and capturing a large amount of supplies. The remnants of the bandits are fleeing towards the Manjiang Shankou area and are being pursued. We were very surprised. The bandits are still entrenched in the Manjiang Shankou, Jinglin, Gongjingkeng, and Zizhuang areas of our county. Our county is sending telegrams to the authorities to request additional troops to suppress them. The rumors published in your newspaper are untrue. We are afraid that the authorities will not understand the truth and it will affect the reinforcements, causing considerable harm. We are writing to request a correction. Respectfully, Xiushui County Relief Committee, February 21.</p>
<h3>Letter from the Capital Police Department</h3>
<p>We are writing to you regarding the news in the newspapers of the 26th of this month about the Capital Police Department arresting officials of the Party Headquarters, which is inconsistent with the facts. In this instance, our department was following secret orders to arrest Liu Jihan and others. We only sent two or three plainclothes officers. They were not uniformed detectives, nor did they carry shackles or ropes. Furthermore, the arrests took place on the road and did not intrude into the house. They did not take place in a meeting place. We also had an official letter prepared to be sent to the Nanjing Special City Party Headquarters for investigation and assistance. This can be verified. Our department handled this case with extreme care, fearing that there would be misunderstandings from the outside world or damage to the dignity of the party. Therefore, the procedures were unusually cautious. Please disclose this to clarify the truth and publicize the facts. With respect, Capital Police Department, February 27.</p>
<h3>Letter from Du Qiaosheng</h3>
<p>We are writing to you regarding a news report on February 23, that the prosecutor of the Nantong County Court abandoned his post and left Nantong. This is inconsistent with the facts. In 1928, Qiaosheng was appointed as the president of the Qufu County Court in Shandong Province. At the time of the handover, a conflict occurred with his successor, Wang Yinpu, who reported him to the Shandong High Court, accusing him of failing to affix stamp duty. The Ministry was asked to investigate thoroughly. Therefore, on February 16 of this year, Qiaosheng voluntarily requested the Jiangsu High Court to temporarily suspend him from his position as prosecutor of the Nantong County Court in order to go to Beijing to defend himself before the Ministry. This was not an abandonment of his post. Fearing that this would confuse the public, I am writing to request a correction. Please publish this letter in the "Letters to the Editor" section of your newspaper. With gratitude, Du Qiaosheng, February 26, noon.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Carries Out Election of People's Assembly Representatives</h3>
<p>▲Drafting Detailed Rules of Procedure</p>
<p>▲Determining Election Qualifications</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Election Office for the National People's Congress Representatives has been actively proceeding since its establishment, under the supervision of Zhang Qun. It is scheduled to start working in full tomorrow (the 2nd). The situation yesterday is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲Expanding Office Space: Supervisor Zhang Qun, Chief Secretary Fan Zhengbo, and others believe that the office is located at the former International Labour Bureau address, occupying only two rooms. They are now borrowing the remaining rooms from the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Supervisor Zhang and others went to the Foreign Affairs Office yesterday morning around 10:00 AM to survey the site and discuss borrowing it to expand the office space. The Foreign Affairs Building is the most suitable. Director Liu has agreed to ask the Ministry for instructions. In the future, it is planned to use the Foreign Affairs Building as the election site. The room on the right side will be the office of the secretaries of each group.</p>
<p>▲Drafting Detailed Rules of Procedure: The detailed rules of procedure for the office were drafted by Li Dachao as a result of a discussion by the secretaries the day before yesterday. Yesterday, they had already been drafted. Secretaries Fan Zhengbo, Feng Liutang, Li Dachao, Chen Kecheng, Chen Bai, and others held a meeting at the office at 11:00 AM yesterday to discuss and decide on the details.</p>
<p>▲Election Qualification Issues: Regarding the election qualification issues, the election groups have already been stipulated by the election regulations. However, according to Fan Zhengbo, speaking to a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency, only the above-mentioned groups in this city that have been guided by the Party Headquarters and filed with the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau are qualified. If they have been guided by the Party Headquarters but have not filed with the Social Affairs Bureau, or have only filed but have not received guidance, it will not be easy to accommodate them. According to the reporter's investigation, among the public groups in this city, only the district farmers' associations have organizations. It is uncertain whether the districts will elect jointly. For example, with the Chamber of Commerce, it is uncertain whether it includes the various industry associations, and whether the various industry associations will hold separate elections. Furthermore, the central government has stipulated that the reorganization of the various groups must be completed by March 15. During this time limit, will the various groups be allowed to reorganize? The election office is carefully discussing this matter and deciding on an extremely fair and appropriate method.</p>
<h3>Zhaohe Pension Received</h3>
<p>▲Distributed by Yang Hu, Military Advisor to the National Government</p>
<p>During the Zhaohe Uprising in 1915, a total of thirteen soldiers and sailors were killed. Yang Hu, Military Advisor to the National Government, was the commander of the uprising at that time. Last year, Yang submitted a request to the National Government to commend the deceased martyrs and provide pensions to their families. The National Government approved the request. The total pension to be given was 12,800 yuan, with 5,000 yuan belonging to the Ministry of Military Affairs and 7,800 yuan belonging to the Ministry of the Navy. Yang, after consulting with Mayor Zhang Qun, advanced the funds. Yang then notified the families of the martyrs to go to Yang's residence on Huanlong Road to receive their respective shares. The names of the martyrs, the amount they should receive, and the posthumous ranks they were awarded are listed as follows: Martyrs' names: Chen Kejun and Wang Ji, both posthumously awarded the rank of Rear Admiral, each with a one-time pension of 1,500 yuan; Lu Yasheng, Wang Kai, Ye Yougui, Liu Yuanhong, Wang Dagong, and He Hanying, all posthumously awarded the rank of Rear Admiral, each with a one-time pension of 1,500 yuan; Cheng Peng, Feng Weitian, Bi Zaiteng, Jin Yiting, and Chai Zi'an, all posthumously awarded the rank of Captain, each with a pension of 1,000 yuan.</p>

<p>▲ The Industrial and Commercial Management Association Organizes an "Implementation Committee" The Chinese Industrial and Commercial Management Association, yesterday at noon, at the United China General Association on Beijing Road, convened representatives of all factories in Shanghai and various experts to continue discussing the issue of implementing the Factory Law. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲ Representatives Attending Those who attended yesterday were representatives of various factories and experts in Shanghai, including Chen Canglai, Pan Yangyao, Hu Shuhua, Shen Junyi, Chen Wanyun, Ji Jiannan, Chen Zongcheng, Ge Shengru, Ji Tong, Yang Xiaoshu, Wu Yun Chu, Liu Ruihuang, Wang Zhixin, Liu Hongsheng, Dai Xiu Zan, Cao Yunxiang, Fang Genbo, Xu Yongzuo, Zhang Zhuping, Gu Xun, Li Zhaohuan, Xu Peihuang, Xiang Songmao, and more than a hundred others, warmly received by Yuan Qingtan, Hu Yinmin, and others.</p>
<p>▲ Overview of the Meeting The chairman of the association, Minister Kong Xiangxi, was unable to attend due to matters in Beijing. He entrusted Liu Hongsheng, the managing director, to chair the meeting. After some drinking, the chairman rose to give an opening speech, stating that Minister Kong could not attend and had entrusted him to act as chairman. Everyone present today has come to study the issue of implementing the Factory Law. The association has now received four proposals from various parties, which have been mimeographed and distributed. He welcomed everyone to offer their opinions. Then, Ji Jiannan, representative of the Shanghai Machine-Made National Goods Factory Federation, explained the meaning of the proposal regarding the Factory Law, providing a very detailed explanation. Next, Chen Zongcheng, Director of the Chinese Branch of the National Labor Bureau, gave a speech on his views regarding the implementation of the Factory Law. Next, Ji Jiannan proposed that the Industrial and Commercial Management Association organize a "Research Committee for Implementing the Factory Law." The chairman put the proposal to a vote, and it was unanimously passed. The selection of committee members was left to the chairman to designate and would be announced later.

<h3>County Clean-Up Bureau Carries Out Propaganda</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Shanghai County Clean-Up Bureau has been engaged in the first step of the clean-up work, deciding to start with propaganda. It has already issued instructions regarding the clean-up plan and propaganda program to the district chiefs and public security sub-bureau chiefs for compliance. In order to make the public understand the meaning of the clean-up, Director Ci Yan specially appointed the first section chief Fu Dianying and the third section chief Yao Fusheng to go to various districts yesterday to convene clean-up propaganda meetings with the district chiefs, local groups, township heads, and local gentry, to provide guidance and facilitate progress.</p>
<h3>National Federation of Commerce Cables Request for Serious Negotiations with Russia</h3>
<p>▲ Using Rubles to Redeem the Chinese Eastern Railway</p>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China yesterday sent telegrams to the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry, and Mo Dehui, the plenipotentiary representative for negotiations with Russia, stating that it had previously been ordered by the Executive Yuan to investigate the exact amount of rubles issued by Russia in China in preparation for negotiations to redeem the Chinese Eastern Railway. The federation then sent a circular telegram to chambers of commerce across the country to conduct investigations. Later, it was temporarily unable to complete the investigation on schedule. As the rubles were spread throughout the country, especially in the Northeast, merchants held them, and it was impossible to know the exact amount. The deadline had been extended several times. Later, news came that Sino-Russian negotiations had been suspended, and ticket holders paid even less attention. Shortly after, domestic military events occurred, and transportation was blocked, resulting in a delay. Since the cessation of domestic military events and the resumption of Sino-Russian conferences, the federation has again sent circular telegrams urging chambers of commerce to promptly conduct investigations. The federation has received numerous letters and telegrams from chambers of commerce and merchants across the country, requesting it to submit a serious negotiation. Now that the Sino-Russian conference is about to resume, the federation will, as soon as possible, investigate, organize, and submit a report on the exact amount of rubles in our country. It is imperative to send a telegram to your government and ministries, ordering Representative Mo to initiate serious negotiations to achieve the goal of redeeming the Chinese Eastern Railway with rubles. This is the earnest prayer of Lin Kanghou, chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, and standing committee members Su Minsheng, Zhang Yuquan, Lu Guangji, Chen Riping, Li Kuian, and Peng Chuli, respectfully.</p>
<h3>Wei Jia-Hua Visited the Municipal Party Headquarters Yesterday for Inspection</h3>
<p>▲ A Thorough Inspection with Detailed Inquiries</p>
<p>Central Committee member Zhu Jia-Hua was ordered to come to Shanghai the day before yesterday to inspect party affairs. The details were recorded in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that Zhu attended the inaugural meeting of the Shanghai Publishing Industry Trade Union Preparatory Committee at 9 AM yesterday at the invitation of the committee, delivering a speech to encourage them. He then went to inspect the party headquarters in the six districts of the city. At 2 PM, Zhu and his entourage went to the various departments and offices of the Municipal Party Headquarters, inspecting thoroughly and making detailed inquiries. It was originally scheduled for him to continue inspecting the party headquarters in various districts today. However, today is Sunday, and the party headquarters in various districts are closed as usual. Therefore, it has been changed to Monday morning at 9 AM, after attending the Municipal Party Headquarters' Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Week, he will lead his entourage to inspect the districts separately.</p>
<h3>Shen Yi Delivers a Lecture on Shanghai Public Works Administration</h3>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works Director Shen Yi gave a lecture on "An Overview of Shanghai's Public Works Administration" at the Municipal Research Society of the YMCA on Sichuan Road yesterday. More than two hundred people attended. The key points of the speech are as follows: The Municipal Bureau of Public Works is the engineering bureau of the city. According to the Municipal Organization Law, it is responsible for civil engineering related to urban construction, as well as guiding and regulating road traffic and citizen construction. As for the content of the design, it involves building new urban areas and reorganizing old urban areas. Reorganizing old urban areas is a palliative measure, while building new urban areas is a fundamental solution. I will now give a brief report on the general situation of public works: (A) Building New Urban Areas Why do we need to build new urban areas? Because the capacity of commercial ships has gradually increased in recent years, and the draft has also deepened. We are concerned that the water volume of the Huangpu River will not be sufficient. Furthermore, the current lack of connection between land and water will inevitably make Shanghai's commercial port become outdated in the future. Therefore, the municipal government is carrying out construction in the Wusong area, on the one hand, building a central area, and on the other hand, building a new commercial port. The Wusong port has closer inbound traffic and is very deep. Even at low tide, ships can stop there. It is also connected to the Songhu Railway, making transportation more convenient. There are many open spaces around, making it easy to develop in the future. The buildings of various bureaus of the municipal government are scheduled to be laid the cornerstone on July 7th of this year, and will then be moved to the new urban area. The road system in the current central area has been planned, and the zoning has also been designated. The new commercial port is under construction. The progress of the central area can be divided into three points: (1) Implementing the acquisition of 5,000 acres of land; (2) Building trunk roads; (3) Preparing to build municipal government buildings; (B) Plan for Reorganizing Old Urban Areas: (1) Planning a citywide trunk road system to achieve overall citywide unification; (2) Straightening out roads that are not uniform in various districts; (C) Regulating citizen construction; buildings in the city that are in danger of collapsing or that do not meet sanitary standards will be ordered to be rebuilt; (D) Improving roads, such as Fangbang Road and Jishui Street, which were very narrow in the past and have now been transformed into Dongmen Road, becoming a major road in Nanshi. Roads currently planned for reorganization include Ximamen Road and Ximen Road; (E) Maintaining Old Roads: In addition to planting trees along the roads and repairing scattered roads, there is also ditch work. I remember that after a heavy rain in September of the 17th year of the Republic (1928), both the northern and southern cities were submerged in water. Due to economic reasons, the municipal government was unable to implement thorough measures. However, in the past three years, 21 kilometers of drainage pipes have been installed in Baoshan Road, Lujiabang Road, and other places. In terms of bridge engineering, more than forty bridges have been built on Wusong Zhongshan Road and other places. There are sixteen docks, and other public buildings include small vegetable markets, police stations, and slaughterhouses. Projects under planning include concert halls and parks. Other reportable items include significant progress in the construction industry, for three reasons: (1) The publication of construction regulations in July of the 17th year of the Republic (1928); (2) The registration of construction companies and architects; (3) The solicitation of blueprints for rental housing. The Bureau of Public Works spends 58,800 yuan per month, with only 35,000 yuan remaining for construction after deducting salaries for staff and other expenses. In terms of area, the Chinese area is 22 times larger than the Public Concession and 56 times larger than the French Concession, but in terms of funding, it is only one-thirteenth of the Public Concession and one-fifth of the French Concession. Therefore, we can only select the most important ones and implement them first. I will now present the content and organization of the Bureau of Public Works to everyone. The organization of the Bureau of Public Works is divided into five sections: (1) General Affairs Section; (2) Bridge Section; (3) Road Section; (4) Construction Section; (5) Planning Section. The bureau holds a design meeting every two weeks and a bureau affairs meeting every Tuesday to report on the handling of public works during the week.</p>
<h3>The Social Bureau Freely Distributes Seedlings</h3>
<p>Two Thousand Superior Seedlings</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Bureau purchased a large number of seedlings during last year's Afforestation Propaganda Week and distributed them to various sectors for planting, with excellent results. It is reported that the bureau will again select and purchase 20,000 superior seedlings for this year's Afforestation Propaganda Week, distributing them to various agencies and organizations in the city, as well as members of the public who are interested in planting trees. The allocation is limited to a maximum of 500 seedlings per district and a maximum of 100 seedlings per school or organization. The remainder will be allocated to the public as appropriate. All those requesting seedlings must declare the quantity needed and the planting location in writing to the bureau before March 8 for registration. After verification, they can go to the bureau between 9 AM and 5 PM on March 11 to collect the seedlings, which will be issued free of charge.</p>
<h3>New Developments in North China Shipping</h3>
<p>▲ Beining Plans Intermodal Transportation The products from the three northeastern provinces that are transported to inland areas are mostly soybeans, soybean oil, hides, and medicinal materials. In recent years, since the South Manchuria Railway has expanded its affiliated Dalian Steamship Company, the number of ships has increased daily, and the shipping routes have expanded. There are dedicated ships to Shanghai, Qingdao, Shantou, Hankou, Xiamen, and Guangdong, utilizing intermodal transportation to monopolize the transportation of miscellaneous grains from the eastern provinces. The transportation fees taken by the Japanese each year are very large. In order to develop the export of local products from the eastern provinces and to break the Japanese monopoly on intermodal transportation, the Beining Railway Authority is now establishing a port warehouse in Qinhuangdao for the export of goods from the eastern provinces and is consulting with Kai Luan Company (because Kai Luan in Qinhuangdao has docks, warehouses, and ships) to request that it send several more commercial ships to the port to open routes to Shantou, Xiamen, and Guangdong to carry the export goods from the Beining Railway. It will also expand the existing Shanghai route at the same time. This matter is currently being discussed. Once Huludao is developed into a free port in the future, the Beining Railway will plan to establish its own Shanghai, Hankou, Shantou, and Guangdong routes. The Japanese were shocked to hear this news, and the South Manchuria Railway Authority is paying great attention to it.</p>
<p>▲ Shanghai-Tianjin Chinese Ships Resume Service After the Bohai Sea was frozen last winter, Shanghai's Chinese ships stopped sailing to the Bohai Sea. They were planning to resume service last month, but Tianjin experienced a second cold snap, and the Haihe River froze again. The suspension of Chinese ships from Shanghai to the Bohai Sea lasted for more than two months. Now that the weather is gradually warming and the number of goods shipped from Shanghai to Tianjin is increasing, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is planning to resume Bohai Sea shipping services and telegraphed Tianjin to inquire. Yesterday, they received a reply stating that the ice on the Haihe River has melted, the temperature is 40 degrees, and ships can pass. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has decided to resume Bohai Sea shipping services starting March 3 and has assigned the Xinfeng ship for the first run.</p>
<p>▲ Chinese Ships Begin Sailing to Weihaiwei Weihaiwei has long been under British occupation, and no Chinese ships have sailed there. Since the National Government recovered the port last year and organized an administrative bureau to handle government affairs, Director Xu requested that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company open a shipping route to Weihaiwei to facilitate commercial transportation and promote municipal prosperity. At the same time, the British merchant Taikoo ships stopped sailing. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company telegraphed the Ministry of Communications requesting an allocation of 4,000 yuan for the start-up costs of establishing a branch office. It also ordered the Yantai branch manager to go to Weihaiwei to prepare for the establishment of an office, waiting for the ice to thaw before officially opening the route. This matter has been planned for more than three months. Now that everything is ready, they are waiting for the Ministry of Communications to allocate the subsidy before opening the route. Yesterday, the bureau also submitted the budget for the establishment of the Weihaiwei bureau and the operating expenses for the shipping route to the Ministry of Communications. It was originally planned to open the maiden voyage on March 3, but the Ministry of Communications' approval has not arrived, so it has been decided to postpone it for one more run, about ten days. The Weihaiwei route will be implemented on the next voyage of the Xinfeng ship.</p>
<h3>The Foreign Concession Water Company Extra-Collects Water Fees</h3>
<p>▲ Real Estate Association Writes to British Consul to Legally Stop the Practice</p>
<p>The Shanghai Real Estate Association wrote to British Consul-General Sir John Brenan yesterday, stating: "Dear Sir, According to a letter from member Xinping Company, water fees are usually included in the gross rent. For example, if the water fee is 6% of every 100 yuan of rent, then the net rent is 94 yuan and 34 cents, and the water fee is 5 yuan and 66 cents. The British-owned Shanghai Waterworks Company collects water fees not based on the net rent approved by the Municipal Council, but based on the gross rent. This kind of unjust enrichment by the company and the landlord's meaningless loss totals two to three hundred thousand yuan annually, which should be corrected as soon as possible. Although our company's contract with the water company stipulates a certain water fee and does not send a bill report, this certain water fee was previously calculated based on the gross rent and was requested by the water company, and it was also allowed to deduct the rent for vacant houses. In order to recover this meaningless loss, that is, the loss of paying water fees on water fees, we once negotiated with the water company, and the company then issued a notice of water cut-off. For the sake of the residents' life safety, our company paid the money under duress and protest, retaining ownership of the money, which should not be paid to the water company according to law and reason. Then, we calculated the rent by deducting the water fee from the gross rent and submitted the bill to the water company. The company insisted on sophistry, and in the end, it still threatened to cut off the water supply to tenants, intending to continue to achieve the purpose of obtaining other people's property by violent and coercive means. The company is so domineering, seeking illegal benefits. Not only is our company's rights being plundered, but all landlords will be exploited by it. Now our company no longer needs to respond to the company's final threatening letter, but only to copy the correspondence and send it to your association for verification, and quickly negotiate with the British consul to stop the company's illegal and unreasonable actions and protect the legitimate rights of all our landlords, in order to maintain Sino-British commercial friendship." The last time your country's merchant-run Shanghai Waterworks Company, for the sake of adding water fees, disregarded humanity and used violent coercive means of cutting off water, almost causing a major case similar to the May Thirtieth Movement in 1925. Fortunately, those in charge mediated in many ways, and nothing happened. Now, the member is arguing over the fact that water fees should not be collected again on water fees, which is an act of protecting legal rights and a very fair method. If the water company believes it is inappropriate, it has the legal procedure to appeal to a public judgment or court. However, it does not do this, but resorts to cutting off the water supply at every turn as a threat, and even vents its anger on residents instead of confronting those who are arguing, which is even more inhumane. This kind of behavior, which is similar to using violent coercive means and intends to continue to obtain other people's property, is likely to cause major misunderstandings and hinder the traditionally good Sino-British commercial relationship. Our association is very concerned. According to the letter, we hereby send this letter in response, hoping that you will investigate and order the company to handle the matter in accordance with legal means, and not to collect water fees on water fees again, so as to avoid resentment and maintain the long-standing friendship in Sino-British trade. We trust in your fairness."</p>
<h3>American Chamber of Commerce Re-elects Board of Directors</h3>
<p>The American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai held a meeting at the American Club the day before yesterday, at which Chairman Follansbee reported on the association's activities in the past year and elected the board of directors for this year. At that time, Pierce, Burton, Fleming, Follansbee, Forbes, Hawkins, Jumeaux, Steere, Stouck, Twogood, and Torrey were elected as directors for this year. Except for Torrey, the president of the American Local Bank, who was newly elected, the other ten were directors from the previous term and were re-elected. According to Chairman Follansbee's report, the association's membership, according to this month's statistics, is 112 corporate members and 48 individual members, a slight increase compared to last year. The newly elected board of directors will hold a board meeting next Monday to elect the chairman and officers of various departments.</p>
<h3>American Consul General Cunningham Will Return to Shanghai</h3>
<p>It was previously reported that the U.S. Consul General to Shanghai, Cunningham, had returned to the United States for a vacation. Yesterday, according to news from the American community in Shanghai, Cunningham will return to Shanghai next week by ship from San Francisco with his family. Cunningham had sent a letter to a friend in Shanghai, stating that he had booked two ship cabins to avoid delays. After Cunningham left Shanghai, all affairs were handled by U.S. Consul General Kim Sheng, who was stationed in Hong Kong. Kim said that after Cunningham returns to Shanghai, he will personally hand over the affairs and return to the Hong Kong consulate with his wife.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Disapproves the Establishment of Zhenghua Bank</h3>
<p>▲ Insufficient Capital...Defective Articles of Association</p>
<p>The application of Shanghai's Zhenghua Bank for registration was previously rejected by the Ministry of Finance, stating that the submitted documents were not signed and sealed by the board of directors and supervisors, which did not comply with the regulations.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>Moreover, of the required legal documents, only the articles of association were submitted, failing to comply with the provisions of Articles 3 and 5 of the Bank Registration Regulations. The Ministry was unable to verify the documents, and the request for approval and issuance of a license was denied, and the articles of association were returned. The company then complied with the instructions, corrected the procedures, and submitted the documents again. Now, Finance Ministry Qian Yu No. 10634 has been received, stating that the submitted documents and attachments have been reviewed. Although there is no fixed amount of capital required according to the current regulations, a small fixed amount would result in an unstable operating foundation. Shanghai is a prosperous commercial area, and banking operations require substantial capital to operate smoothly. The company's total capital is only 100,000 yuan, and according to the regulations, only 50,000 yuan is collected, which is too little. Since the company is established by raising shares, it should also establish a prospectus in accordance with the regulations and submit it for approval. Furthermore, the submitted articles of association are also incomplete, and the registration request cannot be approved. The attached documents are returned. This is the approval.</p>

<h3>Gaoqiao Township Residents Oppose Foreign Merchants Building Oil Tanks</h3>
<p>▲ Appealing to the Central Government for Relief</p>
<p>Since the wave of building oil tanks by the Asia Oil Company subsided in Gaoqiao Township (i.e., Laoshu Sha) in Songnan, another foreign merchant, Texaco, has been encircling land and starting construction to build oil tanks. The villagers have repeatedly opposed it, but the company has ignored them. Recently, they have been carrying out large-scale construction. As a result, all the residents of the township held a special meeting in the township on the 26th. It is reported that they have decided on a plan to jointly submit a petition to the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Central Party Headquarters, and other agencies by citizens Lu Zhongquan, Huang Suntian, Tang Weichong, and Zhou Laiqing, requesting relief.</p>
<h3>Five Thousand Yuan in Taxes Stolen from a Lighter in Wuhu</h3>
<p>▲ Li Zhonggong Strongly Advocates Investigation</p>
<p>▲ Wuhu China Bank Expresses Satisfaction</p>
<p>Five thousand yuan in taxes from Datong China Bank was stolen while being transported to Wuhu. The details of this matter are reported as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Taxes Transported to Wuhu Five thousand yuan in salt taxes from Datong China Bank was loaded for collection by Wuhu China Bank. The money was packed in a box and handed over to the Jiangyu ship for transportation. The Jiangyu crew members were very careful in transporting the money. When they arrived in Wuhu, because no one from China Bank came to pick it up, it was handed over to a Wuhu lighter for safekeeping, and a receipt was obtained. With the procedures completed, the ship left for other destinations.</p>
<p>▲ Only an Empty Box Remains The next day, when Wuhu China Bank sent someone to the lighter to retrieve the money, only an empty box was left. The five thousand yuan in cash had disappeared. The person retrieving the money questioned the lighter's cashier, who said that the entire amount had been stolen and that they did not know who had stolen it. However, the cashier promised to be responsible for urgently investigating the matter in order to find out the truth.</p>
<p>▲ Reward for Information At that time, Wuhu lighter, in order to clarify the matter and maintain its reputation and credit due to the theft of a large sum of money, issued a reward notice and published it in the Anhui Jiang and Wuhu newspapers, offering a reward for information. The manager of Wuhu China Bank also went to the lighter and asked Li Shounong of the China Merchants Branch about it. Li said that there was no bill of lading for the transportation of the money, and according to regulations, the bureau had no obligation to be responsible. However, he personally ordered the lighter staff to be responsible for compensation.</p>
<p>▲ Bureau Investigates The matter was reported to the head office of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and Chief Manager Li was very angry, stating that whether there was a bill of lading or not, the theft from the lighter was due to the negligence of the staff and the dereliction of duty of the lighter's person in charge. Moreover, goods from both Anhui and Tongzhou were transported to Wuhu with bills of lading, so how could this be used as an excuse? In order to protect the rights of the shipper and ensure the safety of the transporter, even if it was stolen, it should be responsible for recovering it. He has telegraphed the Wuhu bureau, ordering it to hold the responsible person in charge of the lighter fully responsible and to recover the money, and not to allow the shipper to lose a single penny. Otherwise, the responsible persons in charge should be held liable for compensation. At the same time, in accordance with this intention, he replied to China Bank, stating that it was under strict investigation. It is reported that Wuhu China Bank expressed great satisfaction with Chief Manager Li's effective measures.</p>
<h3>Continued News of the Gonghe Steamer Tea Room Dispute</h3>
<p>▲ The Case Should Be Heard by the Wuhu Court</p>
<p>The Gonghe steamer's old and new tea room dispute has been reported in this newspaper twice. The following is a report of the news obtained yesterday:</p>
<p>▲ Yih Ho Foreign Firm's Claim: Yih Ho Foreign Firm, in order to eliminate future disputes, has proposed that the Yangtze River steamer tea rooms be reformed with a new method, directly employing workers and paying wages internally, not managed by the comprador. Monthly wages would be given, and the income from passenger alcohol sales would be deposited into the company's accounts, with a certain amount allocated to the tea room staff. However, when hiring, members of the guild would still be employed, but the guild has expressed its disagreement.</p>
<p>▲ Five Tea Room Staff Examined for Injuries: The old tea room staff members who were beaten, including Cui Wanxi, Yang Guisheng, Song Dingxun, Lin Shaozhi, and others, were sent to the court by the hospital yesterday to request an examination of their injuries, in order to obtain official injury certificates as a basis for suing Shen Shanting.</p>
<p>▲ Telegram Requesting Military and Police Protection: Yesterday, the Seamen's Guild, deeply concerned that the tea room staff working on the Gonghe steamer would be beaten again like in Wuhu while traveling through various ports from Shanghai to Hankou, sent telegrams yesterday to the military and police authorities in Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Wuhu, Jiujiang, and Hankou, requesting that they protect the safety of the tea room staff on board the ship at all times when the ship arrives.</p>
<p>▲ Number of New Tea Room Staff to Be Retained: According to Shen Shanting's proposal, in addition to retaining the old tea room staff on board, at least thirty new tea room staff members must be brought on board to work. However, the guild has not yet expressed agreement on this matter. While retaining new tea room staff is acceptable, the number still needs to be considered, it is said.</p>
<p>▲ Lawsuit Must Be Filed in Wuhu: The District Court Prosecutor's Office believes that since this case was first accepted by the Wuhu District Court, it should be handled by Wuhu according to Article 19 of the Criminal Procedure Law. It was ordered in court that the lawsuit should be filed in Wuhu. The group of people subsequently apprehended by the water patrol police were sent back to the court at the place where the incident occurred yesterday for trial.</p>
<h3>Negotiations Regarding a Vietnamese Policeman Injuring a Worker</h3>
<p>▲ French Concession Police Allow Four Things</p>
<p>Around 1 PM the day before yesterday, a Vietnamese policeman from the French Concession's Dazimingzhong police station, transporting many French soldiers, drove a cargo truck to Gaochang Temple in Nanshi. Unexpectedly, while passing near Guan Bridge, he suddenly knocked down a worker, Jiang Along, to the ground. A policeman from the First District Public Security Bureau immediately apprehended the Vietnamese policeman and took him to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. Yesterday, the responsible French Concession police station immediately requested the Public Security Bureau to extradite him. However, the Public Security Bureau, believing that the Vietnamese policeman drove carelessly and injured a worker, required the French Concession police station to agree to four things: (1) bear the medical expenses of the injured worker; (2) compensate for all losses; (3) provide full compensation if the injured worker dies or becomes disabled due to the injury; and (4) punish the Vietnamese policeman who caused the accident and submit the judgment to the Public Security Bureau for review. The responsible police station agreed to all of these, and then the extradition was approved, it is said.</p>

<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Stipulates Form of Election Ballot for Trade Union Officials</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau issued a notice yesterday to the preparatory committees of various industry trade unions, stating that, in compliance with regulations, the election of officers of people's organizations must use election ballots formulated by the organizations themselves. Since the reorganization of the various trade unions in the city, they are about to be established, and most of the election ballots to be used for electing officers have not been formulated. If formats are not stipulated in advance, they will inevitably be inconsistent. It is appropriate to formulate the size and format of the election ballots for the directors and supervisors of trade unions, and issue them to the preparatory committees of the various trade unions, instructing them to comply with them and print them according to the format as soon as possible (mimeograph or letterpress printing is acceptable) for use. This order includes the following dimensions and formats for the election ballots of trade union directors and supervisors: The director election ballot is 14 cm long and 10 cm wide, with the name of the candidate and the name and date of the voter noted inside. The supervisor election ballot is 14 cm long and 8 cm wide, with the same content as the director ballot.</p>

<h3>Public Security Bureau Renovates Detention Center</h3>
<p>▲ Construction to Begin in One Week, to Be Completed in One Month</p>
<p>Since Chen Xizeng took office as the director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, he has been quite active in matters that should be promoted and reformed. According to Huang Daolin, the chief of the Judicial Affairs Section of the bureau, the Public Security Bureau is responsible for protecting the people. The bureau's detention center, inherited from the former Police Department, is narrow inside, and men and women are not separated. This is not only detrimental to hygiene but also unsightly. During the hot summer months, prisoners are prone to illness. The renovation has been proposed by himself, and the blueprint has been drawn. The estimated cost is around 1,000 yuan. Construction will begin in one week and is expected to be completed in one month. The interior has been divided into five sections: (1) detention center, (2) solitary confinement room, (3) holding cell, divided into ordinary and special sections, (4) guard booth, and (5) prisoner reception room. Director Chen has ordered that the renovation begin as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council Adds Chinese Members to Land Valuation Committee</h3>
<p>According to the Continental News, the Chinese-organized Real Estate Owners Association recently petitioned the Municipal Council, stating that the Public Concession Land Valuation Committee is entirely composed of Westerners, which may lead to arbitrary valuations.

It is now heard that the Municipal Council Board of Directors has agreed to add one Chinese member as a valuation committee member, so that Chinese opinions can also be taken into account.</p>
<h3>Labor Hospital Board Meeting</h3>
<p>▲ Resolved to Host a Regular Banquet for Chinese Directors</p>
<p>The Labor Hospital on Xiaoshadu Road in this city held its seventh board meeting yesterday at Dadong Restaurant. More than ten people were present, including Chu Minyi, Pan Gongzhan, Xu Jiyu, Wu Bokuan, Qin Runqing, Tang Demin, Wang Yansong, Fan Shouyuan, and Wang Jingyang. Pan Gongzhan chaired the meeting, and Liu Xinqiu recorded the minutes. After the chairman's report, there was much discussion on the agenda, summarized as follows: (1) How to handle the Nanjing clinic. It was resolved to actively find a house to relocate to Pudong or an area with more factories. If a suitable house is found, the relocation will be handled immediately; (2) Send a letter to Mr. Wang Yansong, a standing member of the Finance Committee, asking him to convene a meeting of the Finance Committee next week to resolve the funding issue.

It has been notified to various factories, instructing workers to be informed.</p>
<h3>First Board of Directors and Supervisors of the Beijing-Shanghai Section of the Railway Workers' Union Took Office Yesterday</h3>
<p>The first board of directors and supervisors of the Beijing-Shanghai Section of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Workers' Union held an oath-taking ceremony yesterday morning at 10:00 AM. First, Chairman Zou Kejian reported on the past work of the Railway Workers' Union. Due to environmental factors and the inability of members to deeply understand the union's purpose, it had fallen into disarray and even stalled. Later, the central government, in view of the fact that the Beijing-Shanghai Railway workers had made many contributions when the revolutionary army first established Jiangnan, and that it was a pity that there was no formal organization to unite them, specially appointed eleven organizing committee members to organize it. Thus, the Organizing Committee was established. Now that the reorganization work is complete, the formal directors and supervisors have also been produced. The reason why the past Railway Workers' Union stalled was because members lacked training. Therefore, future work should focus on member training to avoid repeating the same mistakes. Then, the oath-taking ceremony was held, led by representatives from the two railway special party departments and the two railway labor reorganization committees, as well as speeches from guests. After the meeting, photos were taken, and it was past 12:00 PM.</p>
<h3>High Price of Cotton in Song City</h3>
<p>▲ Farmers Show Joyful Expressions</p>
<p>The Wusong cotton market has been very prosperous recently. The six cotton firms in the town receive about 400 to 500 loads of cotton per day. The highest quality cotton can be sold for 20 yuan per load. Therefore, the villagers are all joyful. The price of green cotton has never been this high. When the new cotton was released last year, it was only sold for more than 15 yuan per load. Now it has soared by 4 to 5 yuan. According to people in the industry, the sharp rise in cotton prices is due to the influence of gold prices. Fortunately, sales are very good, and there is no accumulation. However, all farmers in the countryside who have cotton at home have already sold it all. It is expected that in the future there will be a price but no goods.</p>

<h3>Amidst Ten Thousand Eyes, Snow and Butterfly Confront in Court</h3>
<p>Yesterday, they met as strangers</p>
<p>If I had known this day would come, why did I begin?</p>
<p>Hu Die demands contract termination fee of one thousand yuan</p>
<p>Lin says after contract termination, others can propose marriage</p>
<p>Lin Xuehuai deeply regrets past mistakes and still seeks reconciliation</p>
<p>Hu Die says the relationship is broken and it is difficult to grow old together</p>
<p>丨Judge advises reconciliation, adjourns for another hearing丨</p>
<p>The case of film star Hu Die and her fiancé Lin Xuehuai, which arose from disagreements that occurred last winter, leading to a broken engagement and subsequent lawsuit, has attracted much attention. Hu Die initially filed the lawsuit in the Shanghai District Court. Later, because the defendant resided in the Public Concession, the case was transferred to the Special District Court based on the principle of suing the defendant in their place of residence. During this period, both parties attempted reconciliation several times, but the results were unsuccessful due to significant differences in their opinions. By early February, the court had scheduled a trial date and summoned both parties to appear for the hearing. Yesterday was the date of the first hearing, and no fewer than a thousand ladies and gentlemen attended to observe, creating an unprecedented crowd. The hearing lasted for one hour, from 11:30 AM to 12:30 PM. As a result, the court ordered both parties to attempt reconciliation outside of court and adjourned the hearing until 9:00 AM on March 20. The detailed proceedings of the hearing are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲ Unprecedented Crowd The case was a civil lawsuit originally scheduled to be heard in the Ninth Civil Court of the court. Yesterday morning, around 8:00 AM, before the court's official opening hours, those who came to the court specifically to observe the case had already arrived in a continuous stream. The Ninth Court was already very narrow, making it difficult to accommodate even a hundred people. Therefore, in an instant, it became overcrowded, and the long corridor outside the court was also packed tightly. Those who arrived later continued to come in an endless stream. Suddenly, with a crash, one of the glass panes on the door of the Ninth Court was shattered by the crowd. The door used by the judge of the court was also broken by the crowd. The judge presiding over the case, Zhou Daren, upon learning of this situation, felt that the observers were not adhering to the courtroom's observation rules. However, since the case was being heard in public, he could not prohibit observation. Therefore, he had to think of another solution.</p>
<p>▲ Hearing Changed to Third Criminal Court Judge Zhou repeatedly tried to find a solution. It was reported that the Third Criminal Court, which handles criminal cases, had few cases to hear. Therefore, he decided to wait until the criminal trials in that court were finished and then transfer the case to the Third Court for hearing, as the location was very spacious and could accommodate more than a thousand people. After the news of the change of venue spread, men and women who specifically wanted to observe the hearing flooded from the Ninth Court to the Third Court like a tide. In an instant, this spacious Third Court turned into a sea of people, with shoulders rubbing against each other and heels to toes touching, breaking the new record for attendance since the establishment of the Special Court. At around 9:30, Judge Xiao Xieffen had not yet concluded the criminal case he was handling, and everyone was waiting in anticipation.</p>
<p>▲ Hu Die Arrives with Her Father Hu Die, the protagonist in the Snow-Butterfly lawsuit, arrived in a car with her father, Hu Shaogong, and her lawyer, Zhan Jilu, at high speed. As they stepped out of the car at the main entrance of the court, the photographers waiting in front of the door readied their equipment. Seeing Hu Die's beautiful figure gracefully passing by, they scrambled to take pictures. Although Hu Die tried to avoid them, it was too late. Hu was already slender, but yesterday she seemed to have meticulously groomed and dressed herself, making her eyebrows appear even more refined and her figure more attractive. She wore a long cheongsam with straight sauce-yellow lines and blue stripes, covered with a tiger-yellow fur coat. Her furry boots were black leather, and her stockings were flesh-colored. Holding the hem of her father's coat, she followed lawyer Zhan and walked gracefully into the Third Court through the crowd. Instantly, the atmosphere became tense, and the eyes of thousands involuntarily focused on her. However, she remained calm and sat with her elderly father in the witness seat on the left side of the courtroom, bowing her head in silence, as if deep in thought.</p>
<p>▲ Lin Xuehuai Arrives at Court Later Although Hu Die had arrived, Lin Xuehuai had not yet come. The observers were all looking around, and the plaintiff's representative was also in doubt. After 10:00 AM, Lin Xuehuai finally arrived at the court by car with his lawyers, E Sen and Ni. Onlookers thought that both parties were now present and that they would soon see them confront each other in court, each stating their reasons. After the judge finished hearing the criminal case and announced the adjournment, Zhou had not yet taken his seat. As a result, people talked among themselves or smoked cigarettes. In fact, at that time, Judge Zhou was hearing other civil cases in the Ninth Court and had to wait until all the cases were finished before he could go to the Third Court. Therefore, it was not until 11:30 AM that he and the clerk took their seats in the court. Upon hearing the call from the court usher, everyone in the courtroom stood up in unison to express their respect. The court usher then announced that there should be no noise in order to facilitate the hearing.</p>
<p>▲ Judicial Police Maintain Order However, as there were so many people, there were those who carefully maintained order, but even more who continued to talk and laugh. Furthermore, those who were standing far away, wanting to catch a glimpse of the judge's demeanor and listen to the testimonies of both parties, stood on tiptoe or stretched their necks, like watching street performers in a public square. Despite frequent waves from the court ushers urging them to sit down and listen quietly, they paid no attention to the judge's calls to maintain order. Later, police chief Hui Ding and several Western police officers came to the court and forcibly ordered the unruly observers to leave. Only then did the remaining people sit down and listen quietly, and order was maintained. This situation was even more lively than the Huang Baiying case.</p>
<p>▲ Today, They Are Like Strangers Hu Die sat with her father, Hu Shaogong, in the witness seat on the left. When Lin Xuehuai's lawyers arrived at the court, they initially stood in front of the lawyers' seats due to the lack of seating, repeatedly asking lawyer E Sen, "Where do I sit?" Lawyer E looked around and found no space. He then ordered someone to sit on the left side of the lawyers' seats, right next to Hu Die, only a short distance away. However, although the seats were close, they did not acknowledge each other, as if they were strangers. When they exchanged vows at the Moon Palace Ballroom three years ago, how emotional they must have been! (Hu and Lin got engaged at the Moon Palace Ballroom on North Sichuan Road on March 22, 1927. The reporter was also one of the guests at the time and took a photo, which is attached below.)</p>
<p>▲ Time Slips By, Hearts Suddenly Change After Judge Zhou took his seat, he first called the plaintiff, Hu Die, to ask for her name, age, origin, and address. He then asked the defendant, Lin Xuehuai, for his age and address. Then, he asked Hu Die why she was suing Lin. She replied that it was because he had requested to terminate the engagement without any reason. (Judge) Is there anything else? (Hu Die) To recover various debts totaling more than three thousand yuan, including the purchase of a car, a loan of cash, and debts owed to Hu Die's company. (Judge) What else do you request? (Hu Die) Because the defendant requested to terminate the engagement, my reputation and spirit have suffered greatly. He should be ordered to compensate for the loss of one thousand yuan. (Judge) What is the basis for this amount? (Hu Die) We have been engaged for three years. If the defendant wanted to terminate the engagement, why didn't he mention it earlier? Now, time has slipped by, and he has suddenly changed his mind. The loss is truly difficult to calculate. The amount requested now is very small, as I am afraid the defendant would not be able to afford more.</p>
<p>▲ Deeply Regrets Requesting Termination Judge Zhou then asked Lin Xuehuai whether he had entered into an engagement. Lin replied that the plaintiff's accusations had other intentions. The judge felt that Lin's reply was not relevant to the question, so he continued to ask whether they had entered into an engagement. Lin finally replied that the engagement was made on March 22, 1927. (Judge) Was there a matchmaker? (Lin) No matchmaker. (Judge) Was there a contract? (Lin) No contract. (Judge) Was there a betrothal gift? (Lin) There was a ring. (Judge) Is it you who wants to terminate the engagement? (Lin) I am now very sorry for the termination. Although Ms. Hu's reputation is not very good, as a film actress, social interaction is unavoidable. Therefore, I always hope to restore our original relationship. Now, I do not want to terminate the engagement. (Judge) Why did you have this idea at the time? (Lin) Because I was under too much pressure and was provoked to say this. Now, I deeply regret it, as I was in a bad environment, and there were also disreputable reports in the newspapers. (Judge) What disreputable things about the plaintiff were reported in the newspapers? Which newspaper published them? (Lin) Small newspapers (the newspaper's name is "Big Newspaper") published articles about her dancing and various disreputable things.</p>
<p>▲ Who Took the Initiative to Terminate the Engagement? At this time, the defendant's lawyer, Ni, stated that it was actually the plaintiff who took the initiative to terminate the engagement. The plaintiff first spoke to Zhou, then to various newspapers. The plaintiff's lawyer, Zhan Jifeng, also stated that the matter of who took the initiative will be proven in person. Judge Zhou continued to ask Hu Die when the matter of termination began. (Hu Die) Mid-December. (Judge) Did you agree? (Hu Die) Only if there were conditions, I would agree. (Judge) What kind of conditions? (Hu Die) To return the money he owed me. (Judge) How did you know about the termination? (Hu Die) He sent a letter announcing it. Lawyer Ni replied, "The termination was mentioned by the plaintiff, which was then published in the newspaper." Lawyer Zhan refuted, saying that the publication in the newspaper was later, while the defendant's letter notifying it was earlier. He then presented Lin's lawyer's first letter to Hu to the court. The judge asked Lin Xuehuai when this letter was written. (Lin) December 28. (Judge) What is the basis for saying in the letter that she had improper conduct and a sullied reputation? (Lin) It was reported in a small newspaper. I did not bring this small newspaper today. Lawyer E Sen then requested that the manager of Star Film Company, Zhou Jianyun, be summoned to the court, which could prove that the termination was actually the plaintiff's proposal. Lawyer Zhan immediately said that the defendant had already expressed his intention to terminate the engagement in writing, which was more powerful than the witness's testimony. There was no need to summon him. Judge Zhou, because the portion of the plaintiff's complaint regarding the termination was already quite clear, then changed to questioning the debt portion.</p>
<p>▲ Hearing of the Loan Portion First, he asked Lin Xuehuai if he owed Hu Die Company money. (Lin) Not only do I not owe it, but my salary has not been settled. However, if the plaintiff company provides evidence to prove that I owe them money, I will admit it. Now, I really don't understand. Lawyer Zhan immediately presented the bills, checks, and bankbooks to the court. The judge asked if the matter of borrowing six hundred yuan was true. (Lin) This matter was around October 4th. Hu had me cash a check to pay for the tailoring wages. In the morning, I obtained the money and gave it all to Hu at lunchtime. Lawyer Zhan said that the plaintiff could prove that after obtaining six hundred yuan that day, they also collected five hundred taels of silver at the plaintiff's place and deposited it in the Shanghai Bank branch in Hongkou, opening a current account in her name. Lawyer E Sen raised an objection, but Lin continued to say that he deposited the money in the bank on the same day for convenience and that it was not the plaintiff's money. The judge then asked about the car incident. (Lin) The contract for this car and the registration document can prove who the car belongs to. The car price was about seven hundred yuan and was purchased at the Anfei Motor Company on Avenue Albert in the French Concession. Lawyer Zhan then presented the document to the court, but stated that the money for the car was paid by Hu Die and that there was a check stub to verify this. At this time, Lawyer Ni suddenly raised a question, saying that what the plaintiff requested was the termination of the engagement and the debt. Should they order the plaintiff to state whether they wanted to terminate the engagement because of the debt? Lawyer Zhan then said that this was the power of the presiding judge and that the lawyer did not need to request it. As for the process of paying the money to the defendant, please forgive the plaintiff, as the money was generally paid by her father, and now her father is in the case and can describe it in detail. Lawyer E objected, saying that the plaintiff's father was neither a witness nor the plaintiff and objected to him representing his daughter. The judge then ordered Hu Die to report each payment date and amount given to Lin Xuehuai. Hu Die then took back the checkbook presented to the court and reported the money that Lin Xuehuai used.</p>
<p>▲ Report on Detailed Debt Items A total of 33 yuan and 6 jiao on April 14, 30 yuan on April 16, 50 yuan on February 19, 20 yuan on February 18, 25 yuan on June 30, 16 yuan and 5 jiao on June 15, 28 yuan and 6 jiao on July 8, 50 yuan on April 25, 50 yuan on August 29, 96 yuan and 4 jiao on November 5, 20 yuan on December 14, 50 yuan on February 27, 11 yuan on February 25, 30 yuan and 5 jiao on February 25, 37 yuan on May 13, 40 yuan on September 5, 69 yuan and 1 jiao on September 15, 100 yuan on September 29, 32 yuan and 4 jiao on October 10, 69 yuan and 1 jiao on October 12, 50 yuan on October 27, 20 yuan on October 30, 69 yuan and 1 jiao on November 15, 30 yuan on November 10, 20 yuan on April 5, 75 yuan on May 30, 20 yuan on June 29, 69 yuan on July 10, 20 yuan on August 15, 96 yuan and 4 jiao on February 5, 40 taels of standard silver on April 16, 50 taels and 9 qian and 3 fen of standard silver on October 18, 32 taels and 8 qian of standard silver on December 10, and 40 taels of standard silver on February 10.</p>
<p>▲ Unmarried Couple, No IOU After reporting, she continued that the above checks were all issued by the Industrial and Commercial Bank, whose head office was in Hong Kong, and this was the only branch in Shanghai. (Judge) Who signed the checks? (Hu Die) My father signed them. (Judge) Does this money belong to you or your father? (Hu Die) My father lent it to him. Lawyer Zhan then stated that Hu Die and her father were not separated. The judge continued to ask if she had any proof of the money borrowed from Star Film. (Hu Die) At that time, I had no money, so I borrowed a check from Star and paid the defendant, who said it was for speculation. After the defendant cashed the check, he went to the Shanghai Bank to open a current account in his name. Because we were an unmarried couple, it was not convenient to ask him for an IOU.</p>
<p>▲ Car Purchased in Installments (Judge) Who bought the car? (Hu Die) I gave him the money to buy it. The money given was also a check. Because buying a car requires a contract, and I don't know English, the defendant signed the contract. The car price was 380 taels of silver, paid in three installments. The first installment of 200 taels was a postdated check on August 30, the second installment of 90 taels was a postdated check on October 2, and the third installment of 90 taels was a postdated check on November 2, all paid to Anfei Motor Company. (Judge) Did the checks you lent to the defendant have a record? (Hu Die) Yes, but some had records and some did not.</p>
<h3>Photo of Snow and Butterfly Engagement Poem (Taken by Jin Huating)</h3>
<p>(Judge) How do you know that the checks without a record were used by the defendant? (Hu Die) The check stubs were annotated, so they can all be investigated. (Judge) Did you make a Western suit? (Hu Die) No, and I paid for my own clothing. Lawyer E Sen immediately stated that because they were relatives, the defendant returned 600 yuan to Hu without asking for a receipt. Now, apart from this check stub, why are there no other account books submitted to prove that Lin owed money, while the car contract and car registration document are all in Lin's name? My lawyer also went to the car sales company with Lin to investigate. However, because the car price had been paid off, the contract was lost, and the Westerner in the company was willing to provide a written statement proving that the ownership of the car definitely belonged to Lin. The plaintiff recently stated that she did not know English, so Lin signed the contract. However, there are many people in Shanghai who don't know English but buy cars. Could it be said that those who signed on their behalf can claim ownership of the purchased car? Wouldn't that be absurd?</p>
<p>▲ Lin Accuses Hu of Spinning Words Lin Xuehuai then stated to the court that he had an opinion to present, but he was not good with words and could not spin words like the plaintiff, which was very pleasant to listen to. He then stated that he had read the check stubs presented by the plaintiff and saw that the first item was the advertising fee for the Shishi Xinbao (China Times), from which it could be inferred that the rest was actually the plaintiff, who, because she could not resist the termination of the engagement, came up with this trick, saying that I owed her money, insulted my personality, and damaged my reputation. However, even if there was a debt, it could not be determined. However, the check stub only had the amount and date, and it could prove that the money was used by me based only on the words she wrote. The judge asked, "The plaintiff is demanding compensation of one thousand yuan because you terminated the engagement without reason. What is your opinion?" Lin replied, "I do not want to terminate the engagement now and hope to maintain the original state. However, even if the termination was due to the plaintiff, she can still be a film actress after the termination, and others can freely propose to her. What loss is there?"</p>
<p>▲ Hu Says Lin Values Money Over Love The judge told the plaintiff, "The defendant has now expressed that he does not want to terminate the engagement. You were friendly before, and the defendant regretted his recklessness. This court also hopes that reconciliation is the best outcome." Hu Die said, "We first became friends and then engaged. The defendant initially treated me very well, willingly doing things that others and servants were unwilling to do for me. I was very happy, so I was very willing to let him use the money I earned, and the use was also appropriate. Later, I suddenly heard people say that the defendant was actually wasting the money, drinking, whoring, gambling, and dancing, doing everything. I repeatedly advised him that my money was earned with hard work and should not be squandered arbitrarily. However, the defendant not only did not listen but also changed his gentle attitude into a violent one. I had no choice but to supervise the economy, and the defendant became even more extreme, which was really disheartening. I realized that the reason he treated me well before was not because he loved my character but because he loved my money. Friends heard about it and all advised me to leave, but I still hoped that he could repent and reform."</p>
<p>▲ Relationship Broken, Difficult to Grow Old Together Before long, he suddenly sent a lawyer's letter proposing to terminate the engagement. I replied asking about the conditions. He ignored me and insisted on terminating the engagement, declaring that our relationship was over. I am grateful for the court's advice to reconcile, but I feel uneasy. After we get married in the future, I fear that there will still be no good outcome. Marriage is not a child's play. Since our feelings have been broken, how can we grow old together? Therefore, I really do not want to reconcile and can only let him spread rumors. Lawyer E then defended the defendant, saying that Lin Xuehuai had previously misunderstood due to rumors. Since the plaintiff was involved in a lawsuit with a small newspaper, Lin deeply regretted his past mistakes. My lawyer also advised him to go to dance halls less often, or to go with his wife. If the plaintiff thinks there are lovers when going to dance halls, it is also a bit too much. Hu Die then continued to say that the defendant asked to terminate the engagement first, and my lawsuit with Lingbao was later. How can it be blamed on believing newspaper lies? The judge then asked Lawyer E on what day the letter of termination was sent. (E) At that time, the defendant saw what was published in the big newspaper (the three-day big newspaper) and entrusted me to send a letter to the plaintiff, advocating the termination of the engagement. My lawyer advised him not to overbelieve what the newspaper said. The defendant said that not only did the newspaper report it, but Zhou Jianyun of Star also said that the plaintiff had decided to terminate the engagement. Therefore, I specifically asked to send a letter first. My lawyer then wrote the letter on his behalf.</p>
<p>▲ Lin Xuehuai Denies Using Money Lin Xuehuai finally said, "What Ms. Hu said is all empty words. Since I was over ten years old, I have never been unemployed. Why would I use her allowance? The house she lived in before she became famous only cost 15 yuan a month, so there is no way she would have money to give me. If I needed her allowance, why would she marry a poor guy?" Lawyer Zhan then continued to state that the defendant's lawyer had just said that whoever's name was on the car registration owned the car, which was a big mistake. You must know that the car registration is available to everyone, so if that's the case, then the car drivers are all the owners. Besides, the cost of buying the car and the defendant's debts have all been proven. Lawyer E refuted, saying that the civil law has a clause on donations. Even if the cost of buying the car did not come from him, if the person who paid for it had already donated it to the defendant, it should not be recovered. Lawyer Zhan then refuted that the donor has the responsibility to provide proof that it was a gift and cannot rely on empty words.</p>
<p>Judge Zhou Strongly Urges Reconciliation At this time, it was 12:30 noon, and the judge then announced that the case would be adjourned to 9:00 AM on March 20 and also told Hu Die that it would be best to try to reconcile out of court. If there was a possibility, the lawyers of both parties could mediate. Otherwise, the court would rule according to the law and then announced the adjournment.</p>
<p>▲ The Shape of the Black Gold Ring The questions examined yesterday were purely the questions listed in the plaintiff's complaint. The defendant's counterclaim was not examined. However, there was a matter of returning the black gold ring in his counterclaim. It is said that the ring is worth four hundred gold. This ring was brought to the court by Lawyer Zhan yesterday. Because the counterclaim was not examined, it was not presented. According to those who saw the ring, the outside looks like nine-karat gold, with something inside that resembles a bullet in a hunting gun. However, it is not possible to say for sure whether it is black gold.</p>
<p>▲ The Process of Reconciliation Failure This newspaper reported yesterday that there was a trial reconciliation in the Hu-Lin termination case, which was true. The reason why both parties were still involved in court yesterday was that the defendant did not go to sign at that time, which led to the failure of the reconciliation. Here is a recap of the situation on that day. Lin had previously been introduced by Qiu Yuan of Wing On Company to meet with the plaintiff's representative, Lawyer Zhan, to express his willingness to reconcile and settle the debt. After several consultations, they were quite close and agreed to go to the lawyer's office at 1:30 PM the day before to sign a reconciliation agreement. At the same time, Zhan also arranged for Hu Die and her father to be there to sign. The agreement had a total of five articles, the content of which was roughly that both parties agreed to terminate the engagement, and neither party would interfere with the other's marriage in the future. Hu Die would return the engagement ring, and neither party would bring up the old matters, otherwise, they would be liable. The agreement had a total of four pages. In addition to each party holding one page, there were two pages stored with the witness, Mr. Zhou, and the certifying lawyer, Zhan Ji. After this agreement was written and agreed to by both parties, Hu first signed the cross on it. Lin then said that he had to go home and would come back at 5:00 PM to sign. However, by evening, Lin had not gone, so they met in court yesterday.</p>
<h3>Verdict in the Fu Chang Lawsuit</h3>
<p>▲ Defendant Shall Refund More Than 170,000 Taels</p>
<p>▲ Yao Jixian is Responsible for Clearing and Repaying</p>
<p>▲ If Insufficient, Huang Xianyao, etc. to Repay</p>
<p>The case of Fu Chang Tobacco Company, sued by creditors Mei Hua Tobacco Company, Cao Zhiqing, etc., and represented by lawyer Xu Shihao, to the Special District Court for the recovery of goods, previously involved the court seizing the property of Fu Chang Company, Fuxing, Jiuxing, and other theaters in advance. The previous report has been noted. The Special Court then held a trial on February 21, announced the conclusion of the debate, and announced the judgment yesterday (February 28). The main text of the judgment is as follows: 1. The defendant, Fu Chang Tobacco Company, shall refund the defendant, Cao Zhiqing, a total of 172,131 taels, 4 qian and 3 fen of Huahua goods. The defendant, Yao Jixian, is responsible for clearing and repaying the debts from the property of Fu Chang Tobacco Company. If the amount is insufficient, Huang Xianyao and Huang Xianzhong shall be jointly and severally liable for repayment.</p>
<h3>Aftermath of the Gong Fa Company</h3>
<p>▲ The Manager of the Great World Plans to Develop a Reorganization Plan</p>
<p>The aftercare of the Gongfa Company since Huang Chujiu's death is currently being organized jointly by the Municipal Government and relevant parties, but the aftercare method has not yet been determined. A reporter from Hua Dong News Agency learned that Min Caizhang, the manager of the Great World, has already prepared a real way of dealing with this matter and has separately sent letters to accountants Wu Zheng and Pan Zhaobang and Wang Xiaolai, a member of the reorganization committee. Yesterday, he was specifically interviewed. According to Mr. Min, the method of dealing with this matter is very simple and very safe, which is that Mr. Min will lease the entire Great World, paying a rent of 100,000 yuan per year. The lease contract of the Great World still has 29 years (or 30 years). Within 29 years, 2.9 million can be repaid. However, the lease contract is signed for five or ten years first, as a trial period. After the lease is determined, 100,000 yuan will be paid in advance to meet the needs of repaying part of the debt. Others include the sale of the Hot Spring Bathhouse, which can get a price of 50,000. The Chinese and Western pharmacy can get 300,000. Fu Chang Smoke Company can get about 500,000 or 600,000 by selling. In addition, the land rent for the Chinese and Western pharmacy area on Four Malu will be able to receive 300,000 per year six years later. Based on the above, even if the repayment of the debt amount is within the specified period, there is already ample surplus. If it is still not enough, Huang's private property should also be considerable. For the debt amount of Gongfa Company, at least three-quarters can be repaid in the short term. As for the remaining number, it can also be cleared within a few years. Many parties concerned are very supportive of this matter, and it is currently planned to submit a request to the Municipal Government and the Social Affairs Bureau for approval, and then it can begin.</p>
<h3>Further Hearing of Zou Aizhen's Counter-Suit Against Tang Huixuan</h3>
<p>▲Tang Says He Did Not Make False Accusations</p>
<p>▲Zou Talks About Tang's Character</p>
<p>Tang Huixuan, with a Ph.D. in economics, also known as Chong Ci, is currently being counter-sued by his wife, Zou Aizhen, for false accusation and bigamy. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhao continued the hearing. Tang Huixuan stated, "I did not falsely accuse them. They are doing it openly. It's just that there is no man in their house, and Chen Genwei falsely claims to be a sibling, but is actually committing adultery. For example, there is one instance:</p>
<p>When Chen Genwei was taking a bath, Zou Aizhen would also go to wash her face. When Chen had leftover porridge, Zou would eat it for him. At the same time, his maid, Zhou A'mei, also told me about it. Zhou A'mei was also indignant about it. In addition, many neighbors around also knew about it. Furthermore, she (Aizhen) gave birth to a child in December. I know that I had lived with her in May. How could she give birth to a child in only six months?</p>
<p>It is evident that it is an illegitimate child." Police Officer He Fenglin testified, "I am a police officer from the third precinct of the first district. When Tang went to report the adultery, I was at the bottom of the stairs and did not go up. Later, they brought Chen Genwei and Zou Aizhen up. Zou Aizhen's sister, Yuezhen, wanted to go with them, but I did not allow her to. At that time, Chen was wearing pajamas,</p>
<p>and Zou Aizhen was wearing underwear. I was only dispatched</p>
<p>by the police chief. At the time of departure, I did not know what it was about. I only found out after arriving at Zou's house." Chen Genwei testified, "Zou Aizhen and I are foster siblings. I was adopted at the age of twelve. I used to work at Yingzhong Foreign Firm and later worked at Gonghe Foreign Firm as a sample maker. Tang Huixuan and Zou Aizhen came from the United States one after the other. At that time, I was acting on internal orders to go to Beiping to negotiate construction matters. I was living in the back building of Zou's house. Tang wanted to use me</p>
<p>to facilitate his divorce from his wife. Therefore, he asked Le Zifang to persuade me to reconcile, but I refused." Zou Yuezhen testified, "Zou Aizhen is my sister, and Chen Genwei is my foster brother. He has always been in my house. At that time, there were three plainclothes officers and a police officer who dragged me out. Tang Huixuan saw it and said, 'This is not the woman.' My sister heard the noise and came out. Tang said,</p>
<p>'This is the woman,' and took her to the police station." Zou Aizhen testified, "I was sleeping when I heard my sister arguing with them, so I came out. Tang Huixuan said, 'This is the woman,' and then went to the police station." Last year, before Tang came home, three boxes arrived first.</p>
<p>Inside were all women's clothing. When I questioned him about it, he said that a friend had asked him to bring them. A few days later, Tang asked for a private divorce, but I did not agree. So he falsely accused me. Regarding the matter of raising the child, when I asked him for medical expenses, he said that raising a child was</p>
<p>fulfilling his obligation to the country and that he did not think it was anything special. Please consider his character to this extent." Tang Huixuan stated, "My ten years of savings are all tied up in her name. Now I have nothing to use," and presented a stack of pawn tickets. He added, "If Aizhen can break away from her relationship with Chen, the couple can reconcile." The judge said that further investigation was needed and adjourned the hearing. Furthermore, Tang Huixuan believed that the telegram urging him to return home was a deceitful scheme designed by a third party to falsely accuse him of the risk of escaping, so he declared that he would never leave Shanghai.</p>
<h3>A Kidnapped Child Rescued in Meiyan Township, Wujiang</h3>
<p>▲Only After Arriving in Shanghai Was It Discovered It Was Not Li's Son</p>
<p>▲Detectives Made Two Trips to Wujiang to Rescue</p>
<p>The four-year-old son of a Mr. Li, residing at No. 38 Anren Lane, Kangti Road, French Concession, was playing at the door with his nanny on the evening of February 15th when he was kidnapped by bandits and escaped. The victim immediately reported the case to the French Concession Police Department, requesting investigation and arrest. Subsequently, it was discovered that after abducting the child, the kidnappers had taken him to Meizhen Township in Wujiang County, Suzhou, to hide. The case was immediately reported to the Captain, and Chief Detective Lai'er, along with Chinese detectives Zhang Pingpu, Yang Shan, and others, were dispatched to Suzhou to collaborate with the patrol officers of the third district of the Water Police and the detectives of the fifteenth team of Wujiang to rush to Meizhen Township for a search. However, the kidnappers had already fled after hearing the news, and only the kidnapped child was rescued. In addition, a box cannon, two rifles, and three carbines were found in an abandoned coffin in a certain family's cemetery nearby. Later, the Chinese and Western detectives brought the child to Shanghai, and the victim confirmed that it was not Li's son.

<h3>The Second Route of the Chinese Merchants' Public Bus Will Be Suspended Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Zhabei Chinese Merchants Public Bus Company originally had 26 buses, divided into three routes. The first route had 11 buses, running from Baoshan Road to Jiangwan; the second route had 4 buses, running from Qiujiang Road and North Sichuan Road to Xinzha Bridge; and the third route had 11 buses, running from Baoshan Road to Zhenru. Routes one and three saw prosperous business, but the second route had fewer passengers since it was opened on May 16th of the 18th year, and business failed to develop. From September 1st of the 18th year, the full route fare of 27 cents was changed to 21 cents. At that time, the route still extended east to North Sichuan Road and west to Hengfeng Bridge. On September 1st of the 19th year, the route was changed again to the west to Xinzha Bridge, in an attempt to attract more passengers. However, for several months, the number of passengers was still scarce, and business made no progress. The company's manager, Lei Zhaopeng, decided that from March 2nd, the second route of public buses would be completely suspended, and the reason for the suspension would be reported to the Municipal Public Works Bureau for record.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai-Minhang Long-Distance Bus Increases Prices</h3>
<p>▲The Full Route is 7 Jiao and 5 Fen</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai-Minhang-Nanzhe Long-Distance Bus Company added new buses and worked hard to reorganize, transportation has become more convenient, business has developed, and local merchants and residents have praised it unanimously. Recently, due to the soaring prices of oil and tires, and the continued increase in the prices of various parts, the ticket price revenue is not enough to maintain the current situation. It has been reported to the Municipal Public Works Bureau for approval, and the full route ticket price has been increased by 1 jiao and 1 fen. The bus ticket from Shanghai to Minhang is now 7 jiao and 5 fen, and each station along the route will increase prices separately according to the kilometer. It is reported that the company is scheduled to implement this today and has notified all stations to check accordingly.</p>

<h3>The Wing On Company Savings Department is Reorganized into a Bank</h3>
<p>The Savings Department operated by the Wing On Company was originally allocated a fund of one million yuan by the company. The business and accounting have always been independent, and the credit has been very good. In fact, it is no different from an independent bank, but because it has not been registered with the government, its legal status is not separate from the Wing On Company itself, which violates the suspicion that the store is also operating savings. A resolution has been made by Guo Le, Guo Biao, Guo Quan, Yang Huiting, Guo Shun, Ouyang Minqing, Du Zewen, Guo Linshuang, Guo Ruixiang, and others to completely separate the Savings Department from the Wing On Company to form an independent bank, which is named Wing On Commercial Savings Bank. The company's accounting consultant, Accountant Pan Xulun, has been entrusted to prepare the registration procedures so that the interests of each saver can be fully guaranteed in the future.</p>

Later, a teacher from a certain elementary school passed by and saw this and reported it to the Third District Police Station, saying that this kind of copper tooth, when placed in the mouth, was harmful to health, and if the children were not careful, they might swallow it, which would be life-threatening.

After a preliminary interrogation by Chief Xu, the woman confessed that her name was Guo He, 42 years old, from Yancheng, and the child's name was Xiao Niu, 6 years old this year. "I am my own. My husband's name is Guo Rubao, and he lives at No. 14 Gongji Lane, Xieqiao, outside the West Gate. Because the family is poor, Zhang Hongen (referring to the man under arrest) helped me escape to Fujian to work." When asked, Zhang Hongen confessed that he was 36 years old, and that he had a friend named Li Kaisan, who was introduced by Zhu, who lived at No. 12 Gongji Lane, to buy Guo Rubao's wife, He, along with Xiao Niu, for 42 yuan, to help with household affairs. Li then asked me to take them to Fujian, and so on. Because the confessions of both parties were inconsistent, the police immediately went to the address to summon Guo Rubao to the case. According to his confession, he was 40 years old, earning a living by pulling a rickshaw. "My wife, He, and I disagree because the family is in poverty. Today, early in the morning, I went out to pull a rickshaw. When I returned home, my wife was gone, and my son, Xiao Niu, was also missing. I rushed to look for them everywhere. Just as I was at a loss, I was summoned by the police who came to my house, and I learned about the situation. Please investigate thoroughly."

<p>Letter</p>
<p>Dear Editor, I recently read a news item in the February 27th issue of your newspaper about the "twelve colleagues" \[...\] Shanghai's \[...\] for a yearly rent of 3,000 yuan, which is deeply inappropriate. \[...\] The Industry Association, etc., and Yu Zhiqing of the Sanbei Company are in contact about \[...\] loading and unloading goods in Shanghai, which is a matter of friendly consultation and not a financial transaction. Since there is only the fact that each recognizes the annual rent, how can there be a reason to discuss and allocate the rent? This is inaccurate hearsay. In order to avoid confusion, we hereby send a letter requesting immediate correction to show the truth here to the editor of the Shenbao. Shanghai Fruit and Ground Products Industry Association, Shanghai Pickled Goods Industry Association, Shanghai Chinese Medicine Industry Association, February 28th.</p>

<h3>The Whole Story of Lehua's Failed European Expedition</h3>
<p>| An Uneven Cry from Englishman Li Silian |</p>
<p>Englishman Li Silian, a veteran of Shanghai football and also a famous referee, served as the football coach of Nanyang (now Jiaotong University) for many years and was the first trainer of the Chinese football team. He has now expressed his final opinion on the resolution of the amateur status of the Lehua Football Team by the Shanghai and Hong Kong Westerners' Football Clubs, which is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲ The Purpose of the Expedition is Just and Honorable</p>
<p>At the beginning of 1929, the public knew that the Lehua Athletic Association proposed organizing a football team to tour Europe and the United States in the autumn of 1930. First, they would visit various countries in continental Europe, as well as England and Scotland, and on their return journey, they might also visit Canada and the United States. The main purpose of this trip was to connect with and compete with the friendship of various countries, to give young players a good and beneficial journey, and to allow European and American countries to recognize the demeanor of new Chinese athletes, who could be on par with other countries. From this, it can be inferred that today's Chinese sports are not as poor and backward as they usually imagine.</p>
<p>▲ The Consultation in Europe is Extremely Satisfactory</p>
<p>In the summer of 1929, when Mr. Li Silian went to England, officials from the Lehua Athletic Association asked Mr. Li to contact Europe and England and report back to Shanghai to decide on the next steps. Mr. Li took advantage of his holidays in Europe to contact various sports associations and, before leaving England to return to Shanghai, personally discussed the Lehua trip to Europe with Sir Frederick Wall, the secretary of the English Football Association, who actually controls football movement worldwide. At that time, he obtained the oral approval of the Sir, and confirmed that Lehua's actions were within the scope of amateur sports. In addition, the Continental Association, which governs football movements in various countries in continental Europe, also promised to provide full support.</p>
<p>▲ The Expedition Sets Out, All Preparations are Made</p>
<p>After Mr. Li returned to China and told Lehua about the results of his consultation and the implementation strategy, which was fully adopted, it was scheduled to depart from Singapore in mid-August in order to arrive in Europe in the football season. First, Lehua went to Java and the South Pacific Islands to compete, in order to raise funds for the expedition to Europe and the United States, and to select players from Hong Kong, Singapore, and other ports in the South Pacific Islands to form an extremely strong team. Mr. Li would temporarily stay in Shanghai to communicate with Europe, and then go to Singapore by boat with Lehua to Europe.</p>
<p>▲ The Hong Kong Football Club Raises Trouble Without Reason</p>
<p>In mid-August 1930, when all matters were about to come to an end, the Hong Kong Football Club suddenly banned its Chinese players from participating in the expedition. The reason was that Lehua had lost its amateur status and had become a professional. A huge wave arose from this. The British Football Association sent a telegram to postpone the process and wait for the so-called professional evidence and letters from Hong Kong before making a decision. Everything was delayed, and the ambition of the expedition could not wait any longer. The entire Lehua army decided to return to Shanghai.</p>
<p>▲ Major Events are Handled Casually</p>
<p>After Lehua returned to Shanghai, the Shanghai Football Association had a meeting to organize a special committee to review Lehua's content and players' amateur qualifications. Five months later, until January 20, the Shanghai Football Association disclosed the resolution of the association in various newspapers. It should be noted that the association did not organize any special committees, but this important resolution seemed to be produced in the ordinary executive committee, and none of Lehua officials was invited to attend the meeting to state the facts, so the resolution was obtained in a camera. Before the resolution was disclosed, the China National Amateur Athletic Federation had already held a special committee to review everything and publicly recognized that Lehua still had amateur qualifications and had no professional behavior.</p>
<p>▲ The Shanghai Football Club Refuses to Explain</p>
<p>The Shanghai Football Association's resolution confused the public. With the consent of Lehua officials, Mr. Li formally wrote to the Westerners' Football Club asking it to explain the declaration and show evidence. Two weeks later, Mr. Li received a reply from the association stating that the results of the association's review had been made public and told him that there was no need to reply to this matter again. In other words, the Westerners' Club completely refused to answer the explanations requested by Mr. Li and Lehua.</p>
<p>▲ The Upper and Lower Organs Have Conflicting Views</p>
<p>On February 7, 1931 (this year), the North China Daily News published a message stating that the British Football Association had notified the Hong Kong Football Club that Cao Guicheng and Chen Guangyao of the South China Football Club and Lehua players were all qualified amateurs and had not committed any professional misconduct, and could still participate in all amateur games in the future. Now, the two national football governing bodies, such as the China National Amateur Athletic Federation and the British Football Association, have declared that Lehua is a non-professional athlete. How can the local authorities, such as the Shanghai and Hong Kong Football Clubs, impose the crime of becoming professional? On February 10, Mr. Li again wrote to the Shanghai Football Club, asking it to pay attention to the British Football Association's resolution, but to this day, Mr. Li has not received a single reply.</p>
<p>▲ Let the Public Judge the Merits and Demerits</p>
<p>Now, the Shanghai Football Club accuses Lehua of violating the amateur regulations of the British Football Association. However, the China Sports Association has declared that it has not committed any professional suspicions, and the British Football Association has expressed this later. I do not know if the Association can insist on this attitude. As for the other sections mentioned by the association, there is no point in defending them. However, Mr. Li and Lehua are eager for the public to understand the truth of the matter. Where are the merits and demerits? Can it be judged by the public, or by the Shanghai Football Club or the Lehua Football Team?</p>
<p>▲ Do Not Blame the Past, Strive for the Future</p>
<p>Mr. Li did not intend to resist the actions of the Shanghai Football Club, but for the sake of Lehua's reputation and status, and for the sake of the Chinese football team and players in the future, he had to make this statement. Mr. Li deeply felt that the soundness of Lehua's previous moral spirit should be rewarded with today's fairness, which would have a good influence on the country and the youth in the future, and is worthy of praise. Mr. Li's final contribution is that he hopes not to blame the past, strive for the future, unite as one, and express the spirit of the Chinese people, which should be the same on and off the field.</p>
<p>| Luo Haiguang, Chen Jiaqiu, and Chen Zhenhe Each Scored One Goal |</p>
<p>| Schutze's Failure is Due to Gu Tore's Calamity |</p>
<p>Yesterday, more than 6,000 spectators in the Shen Garden were sincerely delighted, and saw the athletes of Zhen Ru show their skills and talents, scoring one goal, two goals, and three goals, and defeating the Schutze army, and returning triumphantly with a result of three to one. The chief hegemon in Group A of the Westerners' Club was actually defeated by the students of Zhen Ru. Such things are unpredictable in the world. However, Zhen Ru did take the upper hand with its superior technology, and the enemy could only sigh and admit defeat.</p>
<p>▲ The Heroes of the Two Teams... Lining Up Against Each Other</p>
<p>The strength of Zhen Ru's new formation is twice that of the previous one. Yesterday's defeat of the strong enemy was not necessarily due to its strength. The absence of the center forward caused some concern at first. Fortunately, the center back line was solid and reliable, and then the front and rear parts were able to cope with ease. The performance of the whole army was excellent, but the goalkeeper Xie Quanhe and the left winger Chen Bingxiang were slightly worse. Schutze's center back George was powerful in the first half, but cramped in one side in the second half. The front and back were like two people. The ultimate failure was due to the two mistakes of inside guard Gu Tore.</p>
<p>▲ Zhen Ru Team</p>
<p>Xie Quanhe, Feng Yunyou, Jiang Shanqing, Liang Shutang, Zhuang Shihong, Lin Songfa, Chen Bingxiang, Luo Haiguang, Chen Jiaqiu, Chen Zhenhe, Mei Hongbao</p>
<p>▲ Schutze</p>
<p>Man Shishi, James, Gu Tore, Han Ladie, George, Nan Er, Wilson, Greyham, Brandt, Pan Erden, Che Erden</p>
<p>▲ The Forwards Gain Momentum... The Base Camp is Lost</p>
<p>Zhen Ru fiercely pounced against the wind, advancing without retreating. Zhuang's center back sent and received twice, creating endless waves. The Schutze army invaded, taking advantage of the second penalty from Lin and Zhuang, and went deep into the territory. The right inside shot, and the ball bounced to the rear. Mei Hongbao raised his troops on the right border, and Chen Zhenhe and Luo Haiguang echoed each other. The opposing goalkeeper had to go out twice to seize the ball to be safe. Twelve minutes of time had passed, and the right winger Che Erden shot. The goalkeeper Xie bent down to lift the ball, but the Flying General Pan Erden descended from the sky and kicked it into the net from the goalkeeper's hand. Xie was quick to respond and it was not difficult to turn danger into safety.</p>
<p>▲ The Whole Army Rises... And Takes Down the Fortress in One Go</p>
<p>After Schutze scored a goal, there was another period of excitement. Fortunately, Xie, the goalkeeper, had made a decision early and was rescued in time. The entire Zhen Ru army rose, and Luo Haiguang rushed out in front, taking the lead. Making feints to the east and attacking in the west, he crossed the door obliquely. Jiang and Feng were far away to respond. The two generals, Chen and Mei, advanced side by side. The ball was passed to the center. Luo Haiguang turned it over to the left. Chen Bingxiang was in the middle and offside. Chen Luo advanced again, but it was invalid offside. Zhen Ru launched three major attacks. The ball initially invaded from the right, and then turned to the center. Luo Haiguang unexpectedly shot fiercely at the door. The ball came out like an arrow and hit the net. Chen Zhenhe singled out the horse and mistakenly hit the goalkeeper's hand and was blocked by it. Chen Bingxiang once again went deep into the lone army and shot the goalpost. The rebounding ball was greeted by Chen Zhenhe's head and was caught by the goalkeeper again. In the first half, one-on-one, it was difficult to determine the outcome.</p>
<p>▲ The Head Turned Against... And Flew Into the Net</p>
<p>Not long after the start of the second half, Zhen Ru Haihongbao made a stunning move, and made the first attempt to explore the door. A ball flew to the corner of the door, and the goalkeeper jumped up and swooped out. The Schutze army was like a one-word formation, and the five tigers advanced in parallel. The right came and was blocked by Jiang, and the left was struck by the goalkeeper. As the enemy's momentum retreated, Zhen Ru once again raised Chen Zhenhe to lead the three armies, hitting the goal post three times before and after, just like coming out of the same mold. There was a general saying that the god was here, and there were no taboos. Fifteen minutes later, Chen's center forward Jiaqiu was about thirty yards away, suddenly raised his foot to attack. It happened that the inside guard Gu Tore's head turned against the sky, touched the back of his head, and flew towards the door. The goalkeeper was distraught and at a loss. The ball kicked on the top, flew into the net with the fake degree guard. It was unexpected and the audience was amazed. At that time, Zhen Ru took the lead with two to one.</p>
<p>▲ A Penalty Kick... A Great Success</p>
<p>After the two teams got closer, most of the time was spent going back and forth. If so, for fifteen minutes, the five generals of Zhen Ru were also in high spirits. Luo Hai greeted him and topped the ball forward. Chen Bingxiang chased after the shadow, and collided with the guard Ge Tore. The ball hit Ge's arm, and the penalty was twelve yards. Chen Zhenhe assumed the mission of the whole army, presided over the execution, and hit the net with a bang. The Schutze army suffered two misfortunes, and the center forward retired again, and ten people responded to the battle, leading the troops out of the city to fight back. Zhen Ru resisted and made more offensives, but the offside was invalid. As a result, three to one, Zhen Ru won. The referee was Li Te.</p>
<h3>West Qing Women's Basketball Team Wins Championship</h3>
<p>▲ Defeated Liangjiang 25-24 Yesterday</p>
<p>| Liangjiang's Spirit is Praiseworthy and Ranks Third with West Qing |</p>
<p>▲ Mai Ling Wins Liangjiang</p>
<p>Mai Ling defeated Liangjiang by one point yesterday, winning six games in a row and winning this year's championship. At the beginning of the battle between the two teams, Mai Ling was tall and upright, and occupied a lot of momentum. In the first quarter, Mai Ling took the lead with 7-2. In the second quarter, Mai Ling took the lead again with 10-5. In the first half, Mai Ling scored 17 points and Liangjiang 7 points. In the third and fourth quarters of the second half, Liangjiang's momentum was even greater than Mai Ling's. Among them, the referee's improper handling led to failure. Starting from the third quarter, the forwards Shao Jinying, Xi Jun, Yang Ren, inside guards Long Jingxiong, Zhuang Shuyu, Wang Lan, Tu Yunsheng, etc. were in high spirits and imposing. However, they won the third quarter with 9-5 and the fourth quarter with 6-3. As a result, they unfortunately failed with 24-25 and ranked second with West Qing. The referee was Gray Tuoma.</p>
<p>▲ West Qing Wins Dongguang</p>
<p>Dongguang was also a talent for a while, but was jealous of creation. At the beginning of the game, he suffered a series of blows, and the morale of the army was distracted, and he fell into a slump. Yesterday, when he met West Qing, he was largely inferior. After the transfer battle, only Han Wen hit one goal, and the loss was as much as 48. As a result of 48-2, the referee was Lu Zhongen.</p>

<h3>Chinese Students Studying in Western Schools, Tears of America</h3>
<p>I have often heard people say that Chinese people studying in schools founded by Westerners are most easily corrupted by Westerners. The result is that they are willing to submit to Westerners. I say, that's not true. Those who study in Western schools often work hard with international ideas, often wanting to win honor for their country.</p>
<p>My cousin, Mr. Cheng, studied at a public school. The school was founded by the Public Works Bureau. Although the students are all Chinese, the teachers, except for those who teach Chinese, are all Westerners. He once told me something: One day, an English teacher, a certain Englishman, asked the students to write an English paper with the topic "Chinese Pirates." The students knew that the teacher wanted to humiliate the Chinese with this, so the meaning of the articles they wrote all said, "Pirates are a kind of thief who rob and plunder in the sea in gangs. There are the most Englishmen in the world who are pirates. Therefore, great robberies often occur in the Atlantic Ocean along Europe. Even the Spanish naval fleet did not dare to sail in this area. (In 1833, the Spanish navy was the best in the world. Later, Spain and England fell out and fought a great battle in the Atlantic Ocean. The British army was defeated. The Spanish army pursued them and encountered British pirates on the way. The pirates defeated the Spanish army and seized countless military equipment and ships. The Spanish army heard about the British pirates, and they were all terrified. The British navy relied on it to become the dominant force in the world.) Our country has no pirates. It is because European and American movies are imported. The movies all talk about European and American pirates. Our people follow suit, so pirates also occur." The Western teacher was furious after reading it and deleted it all and sent it down. The students were all angry and tore it up. So the classroom was full of flying paper, which was quite a sight.</p>
<h3>A Record of Two Red Doctors in Hongkou · · Knight</h3>
<p>Xu Xiaopu of Wuchang Road specializes in pediatrics. Since his residence was rebuilt, it has become even more magnificent and resplendent. He sees patients every day, always around 180, and is very busy. A friend took his son to see him the other day. It was only a second or two away from the scheduled time. Just as he was reaching into his pocket to get the money, the registration clerk urged him, saying, "Hurry, hurry! Otherwise, once the bell rings, you will have to pay four dollars and four cents twice as much." His self-worth is so high.</p>
<p>Zhu Ziyun of Zhoujiazui's business is no less than Xu's, but his fee is one dollar less. Whenever you call a rickshaw, just tell them "Dr. Zhu Ziyun," and most people know where it is. Since the second time he was unbound, the precautions have been strict. He hired a bailiff from the Yamen and installed three iron gates, which are closed immediately upon entry. Treating patients is no different from treating serious prisoners, but it is also a way to prevent problems before they occur.</p>
<p>There was another day when a drawing teacher, Mr. Smith, asked the students to draw a map of China and draw other things on the map to embellish it. A student finished drawing and drew a large merchant ship, more than ten stories high, with our national flag hanging on it, majestic and awe-inspiring, sailing in the East China Sea. Mr. Smith saw it and said to the student, "China does not have this kind of merchant ship. Only England has this kind of merchant ship in the world." So he forced the student to change the national flag to the British flag. The student had no choice but to erase it with an eraser several times and draw a small sampan with the British flag hanging on it. Mr. Smith could do nothing about it.</p>
<h3>Interesting Snippets from the Opening of the "Snow Butterfly" Divorce Case, Can Rong</h3>
<p>Since the movie stars Lin Xuehuai and Hu Die had disagreements, they filed a lawsuit in court for the dissolution of their marriage contract and the recovery of debts. People in the society are paying close attention. The 28th of this month was the date of the first trial. On that day, all the newspapers published the details of the case early. Therefore, hundreds of people went to the Provisional Court to listen in. Interesting things arose from this. ▲ Lin Jim is excited. The protagonist of the silent love case, Lin Jim, arrived at 8:00 in the morning. He inquired about the opening of the court hearing. Suffering from his inability to speak, he frequently made gestures and used a pen to communicate. He bumped into things everywhere, his expression very excited.</p>
<p>▲ Reporters are sleepy-eyed. Most reporters go to bed at 3:00 or 4:00 every morning, and this case happened to be tried at 9:00 in the morning. They probably didn't get enough sleep. However, this case is a sensational divorce case, and the society is paying close attention. They had to abandon their warm beds and attend to record. Their sleepy eyes are quite pitiful. Some reporters were so afraid of not being able to wake up early for this case that they didn't sleep all night. It was also hard.</p>
<p>▲ Temporary change of court. At 9:00, more than 200 people arrived to listen in. This case was a civil case and was originally scheduled to be tried in the ninth court. However, the ninth court only had seating for more than 30 listeners. Therefore, it was moved to the third criminal court because it could accommodate more listeners.</p>
<p>▲ Invite reporters to smoke red pills. After the news of the court change spread, the listeners all rushed into the third court. However, the court was still trying a case of private smuggling and smoking of red pills. The exhibits in the case were all smoking lamps, smoking pipes, and red pills. After the trial, all these exhibits were moved to the lawyer's seat. At that time, because the audience was crowded, the news reporters were already sitting on the lawyer's seat. Therefore, so many smoking tools were displayed in front of them, as if pitying the reporters for getting up early and lacking energy, inviting them to take a puff to refresh themselves.</p>
<p>▲ Waiting for the judge. The judge presiding over this case was Mr. Zhou Renda. Because the cases in the ninth civil court had not been tried, the court did not open until around 11:00. The listeners were already overcrowded and had been waiting for the judge for a long time, which was very frustrating. People continued to arrive in an endless stream. At that time, two Westerners stood behind the judge's seat and bowed to the crowd to elicit laughter. Their facial expressions and figures were very similar to those of Keystone.</p>
<p>▲ Lin Xuehuai is willing to do anything. Hu Die testified that Lin Xuehuai used to treat me very well. He was willing to do anything for me, even things that servants were unwilling to do... The meaning was profound. The listeners roared with laughter.</p>
<p>▲ Competing to take photos. In order to increase the interest of the news, each newspaper specially sent a photographer to take photos of the parties involved. Some took photos secretly, some requested them, and some pulled them hard. The parties involved were very busy, and the listeners followed and chased after them, like a collapsing torrent. It was truly a spectacle.</p>
<h3>New Embellishments to Wuxi Park, He Tianjian</h3>
<p>Every year, people in Wuxi take the park as the central point for recreation. Although the lunar calendar has been abolished, the custom still exists. Therefore, recently, the people playing in the park are still shoulder to shoulder, like a flock of birds. Among them, the most noteworthy new embellishments are Mr. Wu Zhilao's long couplet in the Tonggeng Hall and the artisticization of the Wuxi Grand Theater.</p>
<p>▲ The humor of Wu Zhilao's calligraphy couplet. The Tonggeng Hall was built by Mr. Cao Zhangheng and other elders at their own expense as a memorial to their common age. At the end of the abolished lunar year, when Mr. Wu Zhilao was in Wuxi, Cao Zhang and Mr. Wu were old friends. He asked Mr. Wu to write a couplet for the Tonggeng Hall. Mr. Wu agreed. However, after arranging the ink, Mr. Wu suddenly disappeared. Everyone thought that he did not want to write. Unexpectedly, after a few days, a postman came and delivered a letter, which turned out to be a couplet paper of one zhang. Looking at the inscription, the three characters "Wu Jingheng" were clearly visible. Everyone was disappointed but got this in the end, and they all praised it. The characters written were in seal script. The upper couplet said, "Talent can carve dragons, skills excel in embroidery tigers." The lower couplet said, "Strength is used to catch rabbits, wisdom holds spiritual snakes." There was also a postscript, but I don't remember it anymore. The original character for snake was 〇, which is an ancient character. Those who read it all mistook it for another character, or some even didn't recognize it. This shows the humor of this old man.</p>
<p>▲ The artisticization of the Wuxi Grand Theater. The Wuxi Grand Theater was founded by Mr. Wu Guanli. The architecture imitates the latest European style, covering more than one mu of land. It is located in the northwest corner of the park. It is equipped with a retractable roof and has complete equipment. The seats are wide and comfortable, without any crowding. The films ordered are all valuable films from Central Europe. The walls at the entrance are painted with lyrical goddesses, the work of artists Xing Zhonglian and Tang Xuandao. There are seven goddesses in the whole picture, all lifelike. This treasure is only seen in movie theaters. The grand opening ceremony of the theater was held on the first day of the abolished lunar calendar. Movie star Ms. Hu Die and Mr. Zhou Jun Jianyun were invited from Shanghai to participate in Wuxi. Ms. Hu was also invited to unveil the theater. Mr. Zhou called it a model movie theater in the interior. On that day, no less than thousands of people visited, which was also a grand occasion.</p>
<h3>One Page of Dog Judging Scripture, Sick 〇</h3>
<p>My friend Mr. Li has been teaching in a private school for ten years. Recently, he saw that his profession would eventually be eliminated, so he switched to studying medicine. He has also been studying for many years and has gained quite a lot of experience. He once borrowed several books on prescriptions from me and copied them by hand. Unfortunately, he died of illness last autumn. His family returned the borrowed books to me. When I checked them, there was a page of dog judging scripture clipped in them. I don't know where he copied it from. I am recording it for the Free Talk, just for the world's researchers who have a passion for Han Lu and Song Que.</p>
<p>Enter the door to the east, exit the door as a dragon. Enter the door to the west, exit the door as a maggot. (Note) Entering the door to the east means that the tail curves to the east. Entering the door to the west means that the tail curves to the west. Like a dragon or a maggot, the difference between good and bad is as great as heaven and earth.</p>
<p>Four feet high, thieves flee at the sight of the master. Four feet low, chasing rabbits in the wilderness is as fast as flying. (Note) High and low mean too high and too low. They are all strange appearances. Guarding the house and hunting, each is suitable for its use.</p>
<p>Two eyes blue, no one in the southern and northern villages can compare. Two eyes yellow, busy stealing food from the eastern and western families. (Note) Pure blue dog eyes are also a strange appearance, so they are fierce. Yellow eyes are inferior breeds.</p>
<p>Jade children are produced in Jiangnan, black dragons are produced in Jiangbei. It is rare to see them in different places. If you see them, they must be brave and heroic. (Note) Pure white is called jade children, pure black is called black dragons. Black dragons are common in Jiangbei, and jade children are often seen in Jiangnan. If they are produced in different places, there is no doubt that they are the leaders of their race.</p>
<p>If there is a golden lion yellow dog at home, there is no need to guard the front and back doors. If there is a peach blossom spotted dog at home, the kitchen will ring with knives every day. (Note) Golden lion yellow is a golden yellow lion dog. They are good at guarding the house. Peach blossom spots are white with spots, like peach blossoms. They are excellent hunting dogs, and they will ring with knives every day because of the game they bring back to be slaughtered.</p>
<p>Facial Assurance, Qiu Shui</p>
<p>▲ A Recent Interesting Story in an American Court According to American communications, in a certain place in Illinois, a female typist from a certain company drove her car from home to the company one morning to work. Because the car's speed was too high, she was stopped by the traffic police, who intended to fine her ten dollars. The woman had no way to pay, so she was arrested and taken to court. The judge presiding over the case saw that the woman was graceful and charming. He fell in love with her and released her. He allowed her to pay the fine tomorrow and did not detain her. He said, "Such a beautiful face is more than enough to guarantee ten dollars." It is also an interesting story. Therefore, I recorded it for everyone's amusement.</p>
<h3>Eastward Travel Correspondence (27), Wu Xiaohou</h3>
<p>The Tokyo Japan-China Association. The Tokyo Japan-China Association was initiated by Baron Shibusawa in April of the seventh year of Taisho (1918) with like-minded people. Its initial fund was composed of the remaining money from the Association of Students Studying in Japan, amounting to more than 37,500 yen, and 10,000 yen donated by Mr. Naito Hisakazu. The association's business was initially to guide Chinese students studying in Japan in selecting schools, transferring schools, providing dormitories, and introducing them to internships in banks, companies, factories, and stores. The first president was Mr. Komatsubara Eitaro. The directors were Mr. Naito Hisakazu, Mr. Yamamoto Jotaro, Mr. Shiraiwa Ryuhei, and Mr. Hamano Torakichi. Mr. Hamano Torakichi was also appointed as the permanent director. Baron Shibusawa, along with Viscount Kiyoura, Viscount Okabe, Baron Yamakawa, Baron Kondo, Baron Kaita, Mr. Tagawa Miharu, Mr. Toyokawa Ryohei, and Mr. Eto, served as advisors to the association. In addition, faculty members from the Imperial University and various public and private higher vocational schools, as well as officials from the three ministries of Education, Agriculture and Commerce, and Foreign Affairs (i.e., the three departments of Education, Agriculture and Commerce, and Foreign Affairs), and other famous figures from the government and the public were appointed as councilors. As a result, the foundation of the association was established, and its affairs grew more prosperous day by day. In October of the same year, the First Chinese Society was established. By July of the ninth year of Taisho (1920), the Mitsubishi Mitsui Company, the Yokohama Specie Bank, the Sumitomo Bank, and the Taiwan Bank, as well as Mr. Inoue Junnosuke and Mr. Kimura Seishiro, jointly donated 115,000 yen, and the Second Chinese Dormitory was established. In May of the tenth year of Taisho (1921), the Ministry of Education again subsidized 150,000 yen from the national treasury's petition fund. In June of the same year, it was formally reorganized and registered as a public interest foundation. In July of the same year, it purchased more than 220 tsubo of land at No. 15 Sakuma-cho, Kanda-ku, Tokyo, and built two-story and three-story buildings, each occupying half of the land (i.e., two-story and three-story buildings). This is the current association building. The current president is Marquis Hosokawa Moritatsu, who also serves as the principal of Tokyo Higher Preparatory School. The permanent director is Mr. Yamai Kakutaro. Mr. Hosokawa does not often attend the association, but his name is used for all external introductions and official documents. This is because Japan is an enlightened autocratic country and has not yet shaken off the feudal class ideology. It is more convenient to use the name of a marquis externally. Mr. Yamai, on the other hand, comes to the association every morning and leaves only at night. He is extremely kind and simple. When international organizations or commissioners come to Japan to visit, the association not only introduces them to accommodation and meals, but also sends a person in charge or other staff to accompany them during the visit, taking responsibility for guidance and interpretation. This is completely voluntary. When the reporter was investigating in Tokyo, although he could communicate in English or by writing Chinese characters (most people in the Japanese middle class and above are proficient in Chinese and familiar with English), he still felt inconvenienced. Fortunately, the association initially sent Mr. Uchida Takeo to accompany him, and then sent Mr. Okada Hisashi (Okada's father, Okada Yumin, lived in China for 30 years and is said to have a historical relationship with this newspaper, Shen Bao) to Yokohama. The convenience was great. As for the Chinese people, their criticism of the association is that it puts on a false show of hospitality to international investigators and that it does not come from sincerity but is pretentious and worthless. However, in all fairness, the association can sincerely guide and assist Chinese investigators and new students going to Japan (from the opening of the association to the end of Showa 1 (1926), the association subsidized expenses for more than 180 government-funded students from various provinces of China who were unable to continue their studies due to domestic wars or other obstacles that interrupted their funding. The provinces were Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Sichuan, Hubei, Jiangsu, Guizhou, Fujian, Shaanxi, Henan, and Shanxi. The introduction of everything is also quite commendable.</p>

<h3>Financial Gold Standard Tends to Decline</h3>
<p>▲Volatility Has Not Degenerated Yesterday, February 28th, the gold standard has again tended to decline, once again breaking into the 770 tael range. From morning to noon, there was still a ten tael range. Looking back, the volatility has still decreased. It is almost as if foreign exchange is loosening on all fronts. The listed price continues to rise by half a point. Trading within the market is divergent. Companies such as Qian Changxiang Zhifeng Yongheng Xing Yuanyuantai mostly bought in. Companies such as Yu Dayuanheng Fuchang all have wise exits. People's hearts are still undecided. Overseas silver markets have reported slight increases, causing the gold price to fall slightly at the beginning. Afterwards, there was a slight undertow, hovering around 70 taels. It was then heard that American congressmen were planning to allocate war veterans' incentive funds to help unemployed workers. If this were implemented, the silver price would probably fall again. As the news spread in the market, the gold price rose sharply to more than 73 taels. Unfortunately, the situation of exchange tickets was weak. Almost at noon, the sellers agitated and returned to a low peak, falling by 10 taels. The large bars this morning may rise again. In the afternoon, because it was Saturday, the market was usually closed. The situation this week was chaotic, with changes of 55 or 56 taels. The total increase was slightly 7 taels. The trading volume of the exchange was about 36,000 bars.</p>
<p>▲Closing Price Falls by Nine and a Half Taels The opening price for April in the free market was 774 and a half taels, a decrease of 〇 and a half taels. Large bars increased by one-sixteenth, and the silver price increased by one-eighth. Citibank's buying interest did not cease, and private telegrams also increased by one-eighth. However, traders selling were agile. Hongli Hengyu Run Changyu and hedgers all had sales, so the price continued to fall. At 9:15, it was 66 taels and 3 qian. Then Zhifeng Yong Qian Changxiang and other companies bought in. Also, the bank's one hundred transactions were currently at 124375. The March Citibank's hedge at 29 yuan 1875.

Then Mitsui absorbed the May British gold at 4375, Zhengjin and others sold at 375, and also sold to Huazhi at 29 yuan 125. Da Decheng Zhifeng Yong and others competed to buy, so the price has exceeded 70 taels. It was then heard that the United States wanted to use the war veterans' fund to help unemployed workers, and people's hearts suddenly turned upward, triggering a rise of four or five taels, to 73 taels and a half at around 10 o'clock. Afterwards, selling pressure did not cease, and it fell by more than three taels to 69 taels and 78 qian. Shortly afterwards, Hengxing Yuanyuan Mao Yongfu Yu and others scrambled to buy, so the British gold was still stable, and the bank ate 4375. There was also a settlement in the industry, totaling 375, so the gold price rose by four taels again. At 11:30, it was 74 taels. Unexpectedly, the exchange ticket suddenly changed its momentum. In addition, Hengxing Yuda and other companies came to sell, and in an instant, the wind and rain spread, almost like a river going down. It fell sharply by eight or nine taels. At noon, it was suddenly 65 taels and 2 qian. At the closing, it was 66 taels and 5 qian, a drop of nine and a half taels compared to the previous day. Afterwards, continued trading was at 62 or 63 taels, because Yuanyilian Da Dalian Gang Yuda and other companies were selling vigorously. The maximum price in half a day was 74 taels and 5 qian, and the minimum price was 65 taels and 2 qian. (According to the listed price, there was a difference of 9 taels and 3 qian.

<h3>Cotton Yarn: The Yarn Market Declines</h3>
<p>The yarn market has turned weak, with a significant downward trend. Recent fluctuations have been rapid and substantial, causing considerable concern. This is mainly due to the continuous decline in overseas cotton yarn conditions over the past two days and the softer gold prices, along with the easing exchange rates. Market demand for spot yarn has been met for the next few days, and there are currently no expectations for significant development in the near future. The price of marked yarn has reached around 180 taels, showing instability. Due to these various factors, even slight negative news triggers market changes. However, based on raw material costs, factories are unable to profit, except for some manufacturers who purchased at lower prices and can still profit from the price difference with current cotton prices. Therefore, some have engaged in hedging. However, a major manufacturer is reportedly absorbing large quantities, with substantial contract volumes.</p>
<p>▲Human Mark (Ren Biao) Drops by Four Taels. In the opening session of the Human Mark market, due to the decline in foreign cotton, market sentiment was weak, and the market trended downward. The decline was significant, ranging from 2.79 to 3.29 taels. In the afternoon, the market remained flat, with each month declining by another 2.4 to 2.8 taels. The total transaction volume for the day was 23,750 bales. Credit &amp; Trust bought 3,400 bales, Geng Feng 1,600 bales, Sheng Tai 1,850 bales, and He Shen 1,150 bales. Ji Ji sold 1,200 bales, Yi Chang 1,350 bales, Chang Feng 1,300 bales, Xie Sheng 1,450 bales, and Li Chang 2,150 bales. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>
<p>Human Mark Closing Prices, Change, and Balance: May 1556, Down 35, 50,850</p>
<p>March 1722, Down 41, 22,950 June 1757, Down 33, 18,100</p>
<p>April 1744, Down 41, 55,250 July 1756, Down 37, 11,750</p>
<p>▲Yarn Sales Extremely Slow. Spot yarn sales are very slow. Only 250 bales were bought by various guilds throughout the day, with fellow traders taking in 115 bales. Customer guilds from Nanyang took 30 bales, Tianjin and Huai took 10 bales each, and inland areas took 46 bales. Wenzhou took 35 bales, Ningbo 5 bales, Xuzhou 55 bales, Wuhu 10 bales, and Hankou 10 bales.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Trends Downward</h3>
<p>The cotton market is weakening, with a sharp decline. This is mainly due to the continued decline in Indian and American cotton, more peaceful exchange rates, and the slightly more cautious sentiment of the Japanese trader Dongmian, who sold off over 10,000 piculs of bullish positions in the morning session, leading to a loosening of the market and a drop of over one tael. However, most retail investors remained long. The future of the cotton market depends on gold prices and American cotton.</p>
<p>▲Hankou Mark Declines by More Than One Tael. In the opening session of the Hankou Mark market, due to the continuous decline in Indian cotton for two days, market sentiment was weak, and merchants closed out positions in large quantities, with declines ranging from 1.15 to 1.4 taels. In the afternoon, the market was slightly weak, with fluctuations ranging from up or down five fen to one qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 64,800 piculs. Yu Da sold 4,500 piculs, Chang Feng 7,900 piculs, Gong Ji 6,800 piculs, Shen Chang 3,700 piculs, Tong Xing 2,000 piculs, and Xie Sheng 2,100 piculs. Yu Da bought 5,600 piculs, Gong Tai 2,800 piculs, Shen Chang 2,400 piculs, Xin Cheng 6,900 piculs, and Yuan Da 2,200 piculs. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>

<p>April 4385, Down 115, 4,100 July 4395, Down 125, 32,00</p>
<p>▲Spot Transactions Remain Scarce. Spot cotton transactions remain scarce due to high prices, making it difficult for factories to participate. It is estimated that there are 1,350 bales of Yao flower.</p>
<p>Fire Engine Flower: 42.50, Chongxin Factory took in 400 bales, spot goods delivered to the factory.</p>
<h3>Foreign Cotton Yarn Falls More Than It Rises</h3>
<p>▲The American Cotton Market Remains Weak.

Futures fell by 8 to 11 points, and spot fell by 10 points. British cotton futures fell by 10 to 12 points, and spot rose by 2 points. Egyptian cotton spot rose by 15 points.

<h3>The Reasons for Last Week's Firm Rise in American Cotton</h3>
<p>▲Liverpool Market Situation Firm and Stable</p>
<p>▲Favorable Political Situation in India</p>
<p>▲Improvement in Raw Cloth Demand</p>
<p>A New York telegram on the 27th reported on the cotton market situation for the week: After a price correction before the holiday, the Liverpool market situation was firm and stable, and the Egyptian and Indian cotton markets also returned to their previous stability. The encouraging news from the Indian political situation and reports of activity in the domestic demand for American raw cotton cloth contributed to the rise in cotton prices. At the beginning of the week, Japanese purchases were a characteristic of the market, but when the October futures exceeded 12 cents, Japanese purchases stopped. A total of approximately 126,000 bales were delivered in March, all absorbed by large companies and cooperatives purchasing spot goods. Weather conditions east of Kansas were overcast and rainy, delaying field work, but cotton crop preparations were generally ahead of schedule, except in the far west and southern Texas. Although merchants were unwilling to buy as prices rose, believing that the shortage of fellow traders had greatly reduced and that prices might correct, the improving prospects for the textile trade made people reluctant to short.</p>
<p>▲Further News: The market situation is more stable for both sides than before, with slightly weaker buying and slightly reduced demand for spot cotton. Recently, there have been reports of considerable transactions in domestic piece goods trading, but prices have not matched the rise in cotton prices, and now there is a slight stagnation. High cotton prices, sufficient rainfall, and large government disbursements have led some to say that the reduction in cotton acreage may not be as large as expected.

<h3>Recent Trends in French Literature - Man Ru</h3>
<h3>Jacques-Émile Blanche</h3>
<p>Jacques-Émile Blanche is a well-known figure nationally and an important writer. He has published several novels, with his most recent, "Aymeris," considered his most significant work.</p>
<p>What kind of work is "Aymeris"?</p>
<p>Many say it is his autobiography, with the events mirroring his own life. For instance, the protagonist, Georges Aymeris, like Blanche himself, is a descendant of a noble Parisian family. Aymeris' father, a respected lawyer, resembles Blanche's father. While Blanche's father had a different profession than Aymeris' father in the book, he was a renowned psychiatrist. The reputations and status of the two are quite similar. Moreover, Blanche is a figure in the anecdotes of modern French literature, as he treated Maupassant's mental illness in his later years. Furthermore, like the protagonist, the author is also a painter and admired Manet (the famous Impressionist painter) twenty years before Manet gained recognition. Therefore, based on these points, some claim that this novel is Blanche's autobiography. However, these are just superficial reasons and cannot definitively prove that the work is indeed an autobiography. In reality, Jacques-Émile Blanche's "Aymeris," like many other writers' novels, draws from the author's memories for some of its elements. These elements have been modified and altered, differing from a straightforward autobiography. The novel depicts France between 1870 and 1914, offering an interesting panorama.</p>
<h3>Among Young Writers</h3>
<p>Two have already published their first and second works. Typically, after a new writer's debut work achieves fame, the second work often struggles to maintain that success. Therefore, the publication of the second work is a challenging and important milestone for young writers. If they can overcome this hurdle, their future position is greatly secured. The two writers we are discussing can both be considered as having successfully navigated this milestone. Their second works have achieved considerable success. Eugène Dabit's new work is "Little Louis." This novel, like his debut "Hotel du Nord," has a very simple plot. In August 1914, at the outbreak of the European War, Little Louis saw his father go off to war. His family was poor, and he had to work at home to support his mother. Several months passed, and these months were filled with anxiety, desires, and turmoil. Later, he also joined the army. His life was difficult and lonely. In a garrison town, he met a former colleague from the shop. This man's uncle ran a brothel, and Little Louis went there to work at night, washing dishes and glasses. The women there treated him as a companion. Later, he left the rear and was transferred to the front lines, where he experienced new hardships. After the armistice, he returned home, but old life started again from the beginning. The plot of the book is just like that. It is not easy to write ordinary events so lovely and touching. The second is Pierre Véry.</p>
<h3>Pierre Véry</h3>
<p>Véry's works are stylistically the opposite of Eugène Dabit's. His new book is poetic, somewhat wild, and both challenging and interesting, just like his debut work. This book is not suitable for those who enjoy clear and adventurous stories, but for those seeking unique poetic charm, Pierre Véry's new book is a delightful work.</p>
<p>Francis Carco, a writer from the Latin Quarter of Paris, is famous for his depictions of life there. He recently published a novel titled "The Street." The main character in this novel is still a French artist with a romantic temperament, but the subject matter is very novel. It can be described as a</p>
<h3>Pirandello-esque Novel</h3>
<p>We know that Pirandello is a modern Italian playwright famous for his novel subject matters and grotesque style. The subject matter of Francis Carco's new work is reminiscent of Pirandello's plays. The difference is that the stories written by Carco still have a realistic tone. Although novel, they are not necessarily without realism, so they do not give people a feeling of absurdity. The plot of the novel can be summarized as follows: A certain writer encounters a prostitute. Because he feels that this woman can be a wonderful subject for a novel, he develops a strong interest in her. He tries to make her fall in love with him, making her feel that he cares about her. Because she sees that he is more concerned about the kind of life of prostitution than some men, he obtains a lot of material from her and her life. But once all the material he wants to use in his planned novel has been gathered, his secret goal has been fully achieved, and he loses interest in her. Although he feels that he should not do this, he abandons her, violating her body and her soul. The ending is an inevitable tragedy. She dies miserably in a hospital.</p>
<h3>André Malraux</h3>
<p>André Malraux is one of the most outstanding new French writers. He can be said to belong to the "New Romantic" school. His works are a synthesis of wisdom, secularism, and resolute nihilism. The romantic sentiment is obvious. His new book, "La Voie Royale" (The Royal Way), is also a novel like that. This book is the first part of a series of novels that he intends to write. The future title of the series will be "The Forces of the Desert," "Les Puissances du Désert." As the name suggests, these are likely to be romantic novels with adventurous themes. "La Voie Royale" tells the story of a brave young Frenchman named Claude Vannec, who, due to financial ruin, cannot establish himself in his home country and goes to Siam. He has studied Eastern art and knows that in the unexplored jungles of Cambodia, there is an ancient road that has been forgotten. Along this road are many unknown temples. This road is "The Royal Way." In ancient times, it was the main thoroughfare for communication between the countries of Indochina. Vannec goes to Siam with the intention of exploring the jungle along this road. He hopes to discover some ancient Eastern bas-reliefs in those temples, which he can bring back to Europe in the future and sell as antiques to make a fortune. But this is an adventure with two layers of danger. First, since he will be going deep into the wilderness, he will inevitably clash with uncivilized natives. Second, if he wants to transport the discovered antiquities back to Europe, he will inevitably clash with the French authorities in Siam, because smuggling antiquities and works of art out of the country is strictly prohibited. But he is not afraid of either of these layers. He is determined to go on an adventure, originally because he wants to experience the taste of adventure and danger. The inevitability of struggle and resistance makes him feel eager to try even more. On the ship to Indochina, he meets a traveler. This man is older than him and has an even more worldly attitude. Claude Vannec proposes that they go together, promising to share the blessings and divide the spoils in the future. The man agrees. The novel ends here. What will happen next naturally has to wait for the second part.</p>
<p>This work should be classified under Romanticism because it has all the characteristics of romantic works. For example, passionate indulgence, rebellious emotions, the creation of one's own destiny, and the desire for destruction are all present. The characters in the book break away from modern society, embrace a fearless spirit, and go to create their own destiny, just like the works of the early Romantic era broke through the barriers of Classicism and expressed free and unrestrained emotions. Therefore, works like Vannec's can be said to be works of New Romanticism, only with a calm attitude, a dry tone, and a style similar to Naturalism. As for Vannec's beautiful language and rich poetic descriptions, they resemble the works of the Aesthetic Movement, exerting all the abilities of delicacy and beauty.</p>
