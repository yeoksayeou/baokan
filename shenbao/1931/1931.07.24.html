<p>時評</p>
<h3>外侮與外交（三）</h3>
<p>今日我國外交之應有準備。應確定政策。旣已略述於昨評矣。茲請請根據事實。更作退一步之論列。外交上事件之發生。大抵都非偶然。都非如暴風驟雨之來自意料之外。卽如我國近百年來。國旣積弱。所處之地位。則又爲世界列强耽耽虎視之中心。歷年來與各國訂立之不平等條約。在在足以引起外交上之糾紛。尤以日本大陸政策之確定。卽無異以我國爲其準殖民地。彼朝野上下。高唱其所謂滿蒙積極政策及對華强硬政策。久已響澈雲霄。而其憑藉不平等條約在我東北各地之一切非法行爲。更纍纍不可勝計。凡此皆早已顯示我國對日外交前途之隱憂與大難。任何事件这發生。不必有定地有定日。而事態之嚴重或困難。當更不難逆料。嚮使我外交當局。平時能就力之所能及。於各種可能發生嚴重事態之問題。早爲相機解决。或預籌應付之對策。則至少亦可减少外交上臨時無所措手足之缺憾。然而就事實言。今日外交當局對於此點。是否曾予以注意。殆爲一大疑問。東北韓人移植問題。内地雜居問題。土地商租問題。性質之嚴重。早已隱伏禍機。卽無萬案發生。我國亦應早日提出與日方交涉解决。絶其禍源。奈之何等閑怱視。擱置勿理。必待其一旦禍發。始開始就事交涉。且猶不能進而掊掘禍變之根。今而如此。後更可危。此我外交官吏在今日所應一深思者也。再退一步言之。我國政府固早已有革命外交之宣示。嚮使我外交當局。卽不能於事先掊掘禍變之根。但於事件旣發。兩國交涉之時。能堅秉不讓步之本旨。以不屈不撓之精神。作嚴正之抗爭。卽不能進而挫人。要亦可以退而衞。不至反而爲人所着先。然而就事實言。已往茲且擱置。卽自萬案及韓人排華事件發生。日言交涉。日言抗議。而萬寳山日人武裝保護掘河如故也。全韓各地「殺盡胡人」之呼聲猶未已也。萬案韓案。同爲日人有計劃有準備之行動。蛛絲馬跡。尋索可見。責任所在。彼何能推諉。正義所在。我更何必軟弱。國權喪失。僑胞慘死。萬寳山農民「國家旣不能保護我非弱者惟有起而自衞」之語。及由韓逃回僑胞被害慘狀之報告。一字一涙一血摧人心肝。凡有血氣。靡不悲憤。然而日人則倔强如故。對韓案則僅表示遺憾。允予相當之撫卹。對萬案則反提出賠償韓農損失等無理要求。最近重光氏晉京。且專談懸案。不談目前嚴重之交涉。其視我如無人之國。至爲顯明。吾人迴思庚子義和團之暴變。殺數外國人。結果遂至八國聯軍。破我舊都。鉅欵之賠償。至今尚按年分付。人所施我者如此。我所受諸人者如彼。此而不爭。吾固何貴乎有國。然而民情愈憤。交涉似愈形鎭靜。迄至今日。外部絶未將兩案交涉之寳况。及交涉文件。向國民作一有序統之報告。俾國人明其眞相。共同商榷。而且徵諸日文報載。日本覆牒原文。我國抗議通牒中。似更有表示中國政府嚴重取締中國人不穩言動之意。故日覆牒中末有日本政府所完全同感之語。是則其爲軟弱。殆無可遁飾。至駐日公使汪榮寳電部報告。謂韓案日人事先固失之防範。事發後則防制頗力。輕輕一語。爲曰人卸脫無限責任。則殆更爲昧於大體。不知外交爲何物者矣。凡此種種。則又我外交當局今日所應深思者也。總之。我國勢積弱。旣無以遏制强暴之横臨。則政府當局所荷負之責任。乃益見其加重。應本革命之精神。艱苦奮鬥。庶幾其可以新内政。庶幾其可以禦外侮。至於激昂之民氣。實爲政府有力之後盾。有外交緊急之際。絶不可加以遏抑予民衆以更大之失望。此則我外交當局所又不。可不知者也。</p>

<h3>韓民移植東北之研究</h3>
<p>（一續）彬</p>
<p>（三）韓民移殖東北之史的考察</p>
<p>韓民移殖東北。已非一朝。其沿革歷史。關係本問題至鉅。吾人亟應追本溯源。以期明瞭此問題在歷史上之進展狀態。并以作如何解决此問題之參考資料。惟是吾國史乘以及古代典籍。對於邊疆問題。頗多忽視。而於韓民之移殖我土。更無可稽。至於日人方面。則杜撰史實。穿鑿附會。如矢野等。竟著成專書。認東北爲非我國之領土。種種狂悖之論調。無非欲藉以淆亂國際間之視聽。而有利於其侵略之行動。吾人偶一不愼。卽受其矇蔽。供其利用而不自覺。卽如韓民移殖我東北之史實。日人亦多杜撰。或故作偏言。國人不察。取爲根據遂至以訛傳訛。中彼隂謀。遺誤匪淺。此吾人於考察歷史事實時。不可以不嚴加注意者也。</p>
<p>據近世較爲可靠之紀載。韓民之移殖我東北。係在光緒初元以後。前此雖有越境盜墾之韓民。要非正式之移殖。淸光緒三十三年吳祿貞所編延吉邊務報告有云。</p>
<p>「國朝定鼎中原。朝鮮列爲藩屬。朝貢聘問。交通貿易之道。率由朝鮮之義州渡鴨綠江。而達盛京之鳳凰城。至圖們江北。爲國朝根本重地。悉行封禁。流民入境。禁例綦嚴。讀國初封禁吉林之明諭。及道光年間巡查圖們江北移民之嚴旨。則國民絶跡於此者。且二百年。韓民更無論矣。國初時。吉韓界禁極嚴。兩國之民。有私自越圖們江一步者。由兩國官吏處死。否亦格殺無論。則不惟韓民不許越江。卽華民之無故渡江者。固亦顯干厲禁矣」。</p>
<p>此足徵當淸之初興。視東三省爲其發祥地。禁止人民居住。尤嚴防韓民移殖。中韓兩國。界限極嚴。韓人固不得渡江犯我。我國民亦不得私越一步。鴨綠江流。無異天塹。實爲可稽之史實。而日人則故謂自有淸初葉。白山黑水之間。幾成爲無所屬之曠野。其言之有所爲。吾人蓋不難灼見也。</p>
<p>迨同治九年。朝鮮大雨雹。國内奇荒。餓莩載道。韓民遂不惜冒犯重禁。渡江越境。賣妻鬻子。乞食求生。然不逾年而韓民之有家室者。仍歸故土。其流寓中國者。男僕女奴而已。（此時吉林琿春等處。有以斗米易韓民一子一女者）。時則但有傭奴寄食之韓民。而無越境墾地之韓民。光緒初元。敦化縣放荒。淸查地畝。朝鮮茂山對岸。如外六道溝等處。間有韓民私墾者。蓋琿春附近地方。每歲由協領派兵巡視。有私自墾田構舍者。卽平毁。而茂山對岸等處。則以距琿春較遠。巡查稍形疏忽也。但時雖有冒禁盜墾之韓民。而絶無領荒種地之韓民。韓民之來犯禁侵入。絶非正式之移殖。</p>
<p>光緒七年。吉林將軍銘安督辦邊防。吳大澂奏准將朝鮮流民查明戸籍。分歸琿春敦化管轄。迄至此時。我延邊境内始有韓民領荒租種。但絶無土地主權。而韓皇怵於其人民之流亡。更有向我國請將流民刷還之舉。其咨禮部轉奏文略曰。</p>

<p>▲兩英雄入塲震天動地</p>
<p>丨夏蓋體重較多二十九磅丨</p>
<p>▲華格東山再起　　蓋華格氏、世界中量擊拳錦標、在其下野之前、每戰必克、保住學譽於不敗、當其宣言躍入重量擊拳舞台時、一般擊拳專家、多予其良好之同情、如昨本報所載、下野之輕量錦標麥克奥立夫氏且許以未來之錦賽家、其受人之愛戴可知、體重一百六十九磅半、</p>
<p>▲夏蓋豪氣奪人　傑克夏蓋氏、去年與薛墨林爭奪覇主時、正在長驅直入之際、乃以犯規被判失敗、論者惜之、迨後夏蓋心不甘服、要求再賽、薛氏不允、紐約委員會遂反奉夏蓋爲錦標、體重一百九十八磅半、較華格重二十九磅、頗占便宜、當兩英雄虎步入塲、先後感受羣衆熱烈之歡呼、震天動地、一時之盛會也、</p>
<p>▲十五合逐鹿并肩稱王</p>
<p>丨全塲觀衆多數推許華格丨</p>

<p>▲華格漸占優勢　第三第四兩合、夏蓋失利、第四合中、夏蓋努力設法、以制華格死地、兩拳横置胸前、面目全露、以誘敵人之進取、然後乘機攻之、無奈華格進退有方、不陷敵阱、華格於此二合、雖屢勝面、但略占上風而已、</p>
<p>▲夏蓋傷敵得利　第五合起、夏蓋猛力擊去、華格倒地、然立時躍起、絲毫未傷、俄而華格目受拳傷、因此連失第五·第六·第七·三合、第八合平手、蓋因夏蓋終不能擊破華格之防線也、</p>
<p>▲華格奮發有爲　第九合、兩人相對狂擊、繼而華格累中敵人胃部、夏蓋爲之擺搖不定、華格遂勝此合、接後第十名、不分高下、</p>
<p>▲形勢捉摸不定　第十一合、華格仍取攻勢、夏蓋受擊、恍如中酒、華格又占優勢第、十二合、夏蓋拳中敵人面部、華格血流滿面、賴其防衞有方、雖失此合、大局無妨、</p>
<p>▲二人平分秋色　第十四合、夏蓋每思一擊而下敵人、顧敵人善於防衞、第十五合、三人加倍努力、但一硬一軟、一拙一巧、終兩合平分秋色、强弱難判、</p>
<p>▲羣衆推許華格　華格出其生平拿手、未予夏蓋略許便宜、因此大爲羣衆讚美、夏蓋對此挑戰者、似有驚異之態、裁判三人、投票結果、道拿文推舉華格、其一推舉夏蓋、第三人則舉和平票、大戰閉幕、遂宣告二人并肩稱王、</p>

<p>▲衞士談話　宋財長發表之談話中、謂其衞士受傷者二人、一重傷、但遍詢各方、均謂衞士僅傷一人、本報記者、因於昨晚訪晤受傷之衞士閔子淸於寳隆醫院、閔右腿彈皮尚未取出、精神良好、據談、衞士六人中、負傷者確僅余一人、當時情形、極端危險、暴徒就余目擊者約有六七人、均爲身穿白長衫之靑年、最初彼等係開手槍、後乃用手溜彈、余等本有手提機關槍二具、新式槍四桿、今晨均用新式槍射擊、恐用手提機關、多傷無辜也、當時全廳烟霧迷漫、余等遂失目標、致令暴徒揚長逸去、殊爲恨事云云、</p>

<p>▲陳局長談　新聲社記者　爲求明瞭此事眞相起見、特馳謁市公安局長陳希曾氏、叩以消息、陳局長謂、余在晨間七時半、聞警卽先赴宋部長私邸謁問、接見之下、余覩宋部長安然無恙、心始稍安、據在塲目擊者、述所見兇犯、多白衣操粤音、以此推測、似出粤方反動派之所爲、至究以何原因出此、則尚未能深悉、現正嚴飭所屬、秘密偵緝、惟路局地界内之警權、向歸鐵路警察担任、故兩路車站南面鐵棚門外爲租界、鐵棚内又完全爲路警、市公安局警察、遠在寳山路口、其奉派在車站者、祗有檢查行李違禁品之一名、係隨同警備司令部偵查隊工作者、除遇特殊情形以外、市公安局警察、皆不得擅至車站門口、此次之事、苟非宋部長之衞十得力、幾不堪設想、而京滬密邇、國府要人、不時往來、本局格於事權成例、殊無從盡其職責、實爲憾事、深盼此後鐵道部鑒於覆轍、加以變通、或能使本局警員與路警合作、庶可免意外之危險發生、卽於其他事項上、亦多便利、如查車照及逮捕人犯等事、車站以内、欲求路警盡力協助、每多困難、例須先行正式知照、始可執行、幾如對於租界之捕房一樣、事權紛歧、極爲可怪云云、</p>
<p>▲慰問宋氏　此事發生後、本埠各要人、如市長張羣·江海關監督唐海安·及銀行界要人等、均先後至宋宅慰問、宋氏上午在寓邸休息、下午五時許、至孔祥熙宅訪晤孔夫人、</p>

<h3>女性生理上之優點</h3>
<p>— 履冰</p>
<p>在我國人目光中觀察。似乎女性偏於</p>
<p>柔弱。而男性則多數剛强。斯雖未可一概而論。但女子體質勝過男子者。究居少數。不意新近據德國某大學教授所發表、竟决定女性生理。優於男性。此說頗奇。誠大堪研究也。</p>
<p>德教授之推許女性。其原因由於實際上女子所含之維他命。平均較男子爲富。彼曾集合多數男女。在距今不久。作公開之試騐。結果缺乏維他命之三百三十人中。祇有三十八人屬諸女性。教授又謂女子所穿衣服。恒較男子單薄。如嚴寒之際。輕裘蔽體。足上祇穿絲襪。毫不畏冷。斯足表明肌肉堅强。爲女性優點。不過婦女界驟聞此說。難免心中發生懷疑。以爲維他命旣多。身體常見肥碩。對於美觀方面。雅不相宜。實則殊未盡然。蓋女子所含之維他命。深藏於皮膚底層之肌肉中。發育比男子更速。行動時間。藉高跟皮鞋之助。足尖用力。而全身欵擺多姿。天然一種運動。足以免除肌肉之過趨發胖。且亦能保持其女性應具之美態。至男子維他命並不過量者。自無須行走時作相似之運動也。據教授研究。又斷定人類之秃髮。爲腦部發育所成之現象。此節無關本題。茲不贅述。</p>
<h3>西伯利亞旅行之險惡（丁）</h3>
<p>— 萍</p>
<p>▲飲食惡劣　車中飲食。不堪入口。七七飯票每日四餐。祇是夾沙黑麵包數片。牛排·臭魚·酸菜湯·輪流調換而已。無一不掺雜灰沙。不惟淡而無味。且極汚穢。極昂貴。例如牛排一碟。取價美金一元四角。（合國幣五元餘）奚蛋一枚。美金一角五分。甚至牛乳·牛油。無不發酸臭。與其食而病。不如忍饑。被扣錢。與曹君同行之西友數人。中途抱病。皆由飲食不良所致。</p>
<p>▲白俄拰祟　火車開行後。沿途必有路人以石塊·泥渣·向車窗及乘客猛擊。餐室及臥房。玻璃擊碎。傷及旅客。在俄境七日之中。共發生八次。客中有被擊而頭部流血者。有眼鏡擊碎者。某西婦腰際被傷而吐血者。詢其原因。謂係白俄失業者。藉此以洩憤。可謂無聊之尤者矣。</p>
<p>▲没收機件　旅客中隨身携帶之照相機·打字機·望遠鏡·留聲機·無線電收音機·等、赤俄認爲資本家所有物。依舊章一概没收。今則抽收入口稅。幾成無定則。惟照相底片。於出境時須由關員冲洗。有時亦被没收。蓋恐揭破赤俄專政後之内幕也。</p>
<p>▲樂如仙境　旅客一進滿洲里。如歸故鄕。莫不笑逐顔開。余等一路困頓之餘。率皆面黄肌瘦。疲憊不堪。中俄交界换車之日。各各互相慶賀。中國關吏及護路警察。亦均笑靨相迎。余等彷彿破重圍。脫虎穴。入蓬萊。登仙境。其愉悅匪可以言語形容也。</p>
<h3>夏荷瑣談</h3>
<p>— 楊一笑</p>
<p>▲荷茶　荷花初開時。取細茶葉一撮。以薄紙包之。置花中。明晨取出。泡茶於其内。更覺淸香而味美。</p>
<p>▲荷露　夏日取荷露。其法以竹竿揭新潔毛巾一條。向荷池攝取。待巾潤濕。以兩手緊絞於器中。飲之味甘。并可消暑袪熱。</p>
<p>▲荷粥　沙鍋内燉粥。放連梗荷葉一張。俟粥初沸。卽可取去。則色徵碧。而芳香滿口矣。</p>
<p>▲荷片　白荷花取其初放而無疵之瓣。以雞蛋靑麵糊拌匀。入油鑊。汆之二面黄卽止。加白糖小許於其上。香脆可口。</p>
<h3>空棺計</h3>
<p>— 黄影呆</p>
<p>有張某者。新靑年也。曩曾求學滬上。卒業而後。任職於天津某機關。乃挈眷北上。其妻亦爲新式女子。夫婦二人。在津賃屋而居。享盡新家庭樂趣張喪偶而後。倍嘗鰥居之苦。嗣得岳家去電。囑其將柩運回南方。奈張之在津。所入非豐。平時夫婦二人。僅堪温飽耳。自津運柩南旋。所費當非千元不可。一時人地生疏。無法籌此鉅欵。乃决意將其愛妻。實行火葬。用最新式之電葬方法。在十五分鐘内屍體卽化成灰燼。裝入一洋鐵盒内。預備携盒南旋。乃岳家之人。思想陳舊。如言火葬。必加反對。嗣後並屢屢去電。促張將柩運回。張無奈。且彼此向屬親戚。恐傷情面。乃設一空棺之計。事前携此鐵盒。先行南旋。抵滬後。購一空棺。將鐵盒及其妻生前愛物。置諸棺中。寄厝於某公所殯房。然後報告岳家。謂柩已運回。寄厝某公所中。岳家諸人。聞訊之下。卽往公所祭吊。其岳母並扶棺大哭。不勝悲哀。不知棺中無物。僅灰燼一盒耳。</p>
<h3>可怕的水災</h3>
<p>— 羽</p>
<p>中國人在這幾年裏。受盡災難。如兵災·旱災·匪災·及其他種種·不一而足。各種被災區域。往往廣袤數省。被災期間。又往往綿亘數年。人民之死亡。多到不可數計。並且至今未已。各災區的人民。尚不知何日纔能脫離水火而登袵。不料新近又加上一種向所未有而區域尤爲廣大的水災。方在開始造成中。將來爲害至若何程度。還未能預測。各地的人心。却已恐慌至不可名狀了。唉。彼蒼不仁。一至於此。還有什麽說的呢。若問災區如何廣大。則竟可以說南北東西。無地没有被災的可能。南北新舊兩都。都已發生災象。北平自本月初一日大雷雨後。電燈電話之線。盡被吹斷。全市黑漆漆地。有三人被雷殛死。房屋倒毁無數。街上水深没踝。一片汪洋。成爲澤國。永定河水陡漲二丈。超過地平線五尺。水距堤面。不過尺許。隨時有潰决的危險。張副司令學良特令工兵紮營堤上。日夜防維。四郊農田。也變成汪洋萬頃。就是徼倖不再降大雨。永定河維持不潰而秋收已是無望了。南京在上星期内。亦大雨如注。各街道積水没脛。其他各地。亦多患水。有成災象之勢。舉此新舊兩都爲例。其餘便可想見。昨天遇見一個高郵來的朋友。方知江北各邑的水災。格外厲害。這位朋友由高郵來時。人民住宅已大半爲水所淹。浸坍住宅一千餘家。運河陡漲至一丈四尺。人民日夜恐慌。不遑寢食。因爲運河之西。只隔一隄岸。便是四百餘里北連洪澤的西湖。如果再降大雨。隄岸就靠不住。隄岸一决。高郵全縣陸地。就要與西湖連結起來。全部人民有葬身魚腹之虞。上海已續降大雨數次。不知高郵現在怎樣了。我的故鄉。當然也是可慮。在半月之前報上卽有鮑家壩險些兒潰决的記載。更聞人言。城上亦已有水。那末四鄉農田之被淹。自更不消說得了。且鎭江輪船已停開多日。消息隔絶。所以連家書也接不着。不知究竟被災至若何程度。俗語道「水火無情」。可是水之爲災。有極大的普遍性。火災不過一地。又那能相提並論呢。唉。可怕的水災。</p>

<p>三月一日晨。一學生克利須那。年可十六歲。約余往詣印度教之金廟。蓋波羅奈有名之廟也數日。彼卽促余往。云不可不去一觀印度教之精華。余等步行而往。約三里。過窄巷。曲折甚多。車馬不能通也。漸見有許多老哲人面塗五彩。從此出。知離金廟不遠矣。有許多窮人索錢。若與其一。則彼將取包圍之勢。亦不敢與。至一窄巷口。忽見有灰白大物。頭有雙角。從巷口出。衆皆以手抹其額曰。此神物也。余視之。乃一灰白之牛。恭敬讓路。令神牛過去。又有一小神牛隨之。巷旣窄。一神牛之身當道。已無餘地可通行人。男女甚多。殊擁擠。地下多水泥與花。忽有一人止余前進。曰此何人。可以入印度神廟乎。學生曰。此中國佛教徒也。彼乃洒水於余頭。乃可過。過者必洒水也。又前進至廟門。須脫鞋。見一井内散多種花。有售花者。須以花水洒頭。乃可入。又有守門者不許入。彼見吾戴之帽爲西氏。云是耶穌教徒。學生與說明良久。乃得入。據云。雖遠地印度人。亦有時不得入也。其神聖難瞻仰如此。余持花跣足。隨衆擁入。地下水泥。廟中惟見多人擠於花水壇旁。水中央有隂陽石。卽余見述之男女隂陽具交合狀之聖物。衆圍而受洗禮。但室中四面皆懸鏡。照見無數人皆在此受洗。余知催眠術中有此一法。爲滿室懸鏡催眠法。入其中。人旣多。擠不得上。其人衣服均不潔。余甚畏擁擠。而引導者必欲令余一沾花水之恩。曳余擠上。余腹内欲笑不得。不久卽出。此卽受金廟之洗禮矣。余前曾同回教人參與回教禮拜。此次參與印度隂陽教之洗禮。亦學無量法而已。玩其人生之儀式。衆生無量。吾又安敢甚非之哉。</p>
<p>出金廟約一里許。乃至恒河邊。朝日東升。河水澄淸。景緻甚美。不若加爾吉打市恒河之濁。然男婦仍浴於濁泥中。求解脫也。此水淸且漣漪。有小舟盪漾往來、忽見波中出一大頭。如人頭狀。余驚問此何物也。曰大魚耳。余問此間無人打魚否。答此神市無人吃魚。大魚亦不吃人。過此至他處。回教人打魚吃。大魚亦吃人矣。此地大魚任其往來。並不傷人也。余似信學童之言。殊有理。與昨某教授言。甘地聽人打虎蛇而爲之哀悼相等。蓋因果之理。兩不相害。則相忘也。徐州北方人好吃狗肉。故狗往往吃死人。吾鄉父老云江南人不吃狗肉。故停棺於野甚久。狗無食死人者。父老云然。想與此童所論波羅奈人不食魚魚亦不食人之理相同歟。吾尚未能十分信之。因余頭腦有科學之理在。亦一半信此宗教上之科學因果談也。</p>

<h3>？？？（三一）</h3>
<p>— 徐卓呆</p>
<p>「不會？你不會捉臭虫，就可以做我的丈夫麽？」</p>
<p>「笑話！你的丈夫，一定要會捉臭虫的麽？」</p>
<p>「也不獨是我的丈夫，凡是不會捉臭虫的人，不配做任何人的丈夫！」</p>
<p>子良氣極了，他立着並不過去捉。</p>
<p>「那末，我們岳父岳母選女婿的時候，何不先開一個捉臭虫大會，看什麽人捉得多，就把女兒嫁給他？」</p>
<p>「這不是我創始。聽說杭州有一家紗廠裏，工人閙着寄宿舍裏有臭虫，於是經理先生，忽然發一個命令下來，說無論大小職員，以至工人，凡是不會捉臭虫的，一律停歇生意。當眞這命令一下，大家努力捕捉，没有好久，竟把臭虫捉斷了根了。有幾個實在不會捉的人，在月底捲舖蓋滾蛋。有人替他們去說說情，那經理先生說：一個人連臭虫都不會捉，還能做别的事情麽？還配做工人麽？照這經理先生的話看來，可見捉臭虫是人生極容易的一種工作，所以你做丈夫的，也不能不會。不會，也可以歇生意！」</p>
<p>說罷，伊又是笑着。</p>
<p>「這是經理對工人的話，不是女子對丈夫的話。」</p>
<p>「丈夫也是工人之一種！」</p>
<p>子良曉得越說越不對，還是姑且去捉捉，敷衍一下罷。他先點了一枝洋燭，走到床前，翻開枕頭一看，總算是子良的運氣，就看見有一個大臭虫，在那裏疾走。</p>

<h3>紗花　紗市受流言打擊</h3>
<p>紗市上午因哀悼死難僑胞停市半天、午後開市、現紗銷路益暢、且對於檢查劣貨工作、業已實行、各地大都不能通行、故東洋紗大受影響本紗價格上漲、日紗反跌、所以一部份做多心思異常濃厚、惟某巨戸依然抛賣不絶、市面壓力尚重、而時局謠言紛紛、金價又跌、於是打擊尤重、但榮興號購進六·七千包、前途情形、殊不敢逆料也、</p>
<p>▲人標隨金價突跌　交易所人標午後開盤、市氣堅挺漲風劇烈各月漲一兩外、旋至二三盤突然轉跌、以金市大跌、流言紛紛、結果近跌二錢、遠漲二錢、成交計四萬零七百五十包、查裕大一千三百包、森康八百五十包、瑞大二千四百包、益昶一千零五十包、大昶一千四百五十包、買進明德七百五十包、榮興六千八百五十包、永豐六百五十包、元泰六百五十包、茲將人標收盤價錄左、</p>

<h3>棉市被雨冲高</h3>
<p>棉市始漲後跌、海外印美棉市狀况、一味傾向下游、本埠因天雨綿綿、新棉有水災之患、人心堅挺、散戸多數購進做多、但金價疲落、現棉生意岑寂、一部份執貨者、套賣不絶云、</p>
<p>▲漢標始漲後跌　交易所漢標午後開盤、形勢十分鋒利、各月漲五·六·七錢、二三盤以金價大跌、市面亦小、結果各月漲五分至一錢半、成交計十一萬四千八百担、查賣出和愼二千三百担、裕大二千担、公泰三千六百担、庚豐三千五百担、恒德二千三百担、信誠二千担、新亨三千九百担、晋豐三千五百担、買進大豐一千八百担、榮興六千六百担、愼昌三千六百担、厚豐二千三百担、同興二千二百担、益昶二千一百担、長豐二千七百担、德記三千四百担、新豐七千四百担、茲將漢標收盤價錄左、</p>

<h3>糧食　天雨米價日漲</h3>
<p>▲新閘　昨日内地來貨、計常熟·無錫·崑山·丹陽·重固·靑浦·西塘等十艘左右、晨間因大雨停斛、及至午後、同興公萬盛泰瑞昌和豐泰大昌等五家北粳薄稻做開千餘擔、形勢比前市喊起近尺、其餘之貨、均無交易、據西路來信、糙粳市面步增、故本埠形勢、難以回低、</p>
<p>▲南頭　各帮來源寥寥、浦存亦弱、城鄉店銷乃觀天時小雨、且聞上路發水、人心更堅、厚粳行情高料又增角許、但中段略爲帶起、薄稻到積凋零寗胃及本街銷場、實屬不敷分配、市價又提二三角、蘆洋尖到銷二平、勢無榮辱、洋米來貨仍乏、客帮稍取、致價步緊、</p>
<h3>絲茶　歐莊乘機補購廠經</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊絲市、實銷依然不動、祇各歐莊以外匯平定、乘機補充黄白廠經等缺貨、而海外絲電仍無轉滬、昨祗連納等進滬白廠經三十包、達昌等進黄廠經二十五包、安利進白乾經十包、價均堅挺云、</p>
<h3>無錫新廠經八十件運滬</h3>
<p>無錫各絲廠自新繭上市後、相繼開工繅製、本月份新繭絲期貨在滬抛成不弱、茲以月終解期將屆、分裝存絲運滬、昨午滬錫客車、運到金雙鷹金雙鹿等牌新廠經八十件、預備送請騐絲處、檢騐條份後、依期交解各洋行云、</p>
<h3>綠茶交易旺盛</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊茶市、路莊土莊平水等路綠茶、英法各莊進意均趨濃厚、交易頗形旺盛、其中針眉秀眉等項、市盤激漲四五兩、蝦目鳳眉大帮等貨、　勢亦均趨堅硬、珍眉去路、雖較前活潑、然因存民豐厚、售價仍難站定、至買熙一項、市面完全停頓云、</p>
<h3>糖市荷糖抛貨猛開二千噸</h3>
<p>▲上氷白價開十四兩二錢</p>
<p>昨日糖市産區電訊、古巴現糖價未變更、紐約期糖各月份均比升一分至四分不等、爪哇現期糖依然無升沉、公會市塲創盤、市氣頗堅、但需要較寥、故交易殊屬零落、荷糖二十四號粗砂、</p>
<p>白、香港貨成交價自十一兩四錢二分半至四錢半、二十號中砂白十兩○九錢半至十一兩、市形均屬堅秀、太古車糖ＨＭ嘜十一兩四錢、趨勢尚挺、Ｂ嘜十二兩一錢、ＣＷ嘜十一兩九錢、ＤＹ嘜十一兩八錢、市則較平、抛貨荷糖、交易頗盛、源仝持攀新亦開出一千一百噸、價格相同、南盛隆開出八九月份粗砂白三百噸、價五元九角半、源記售出十六號中砂白三百噸、價五元五角、係可納每擔二元四角之中稅、故要手尚勇、市象均且俏秀、號盤有國貨足上冰白糖開出數十包、價十四兩二錢、略高者號索十四兩五錢、尚無問津、上湖赤開十一兩四錢半、南靑八兩六錢、亦各有售開、市形殊不弱云、</p>
<h3>五金美白鐵走銷漸旺</h3>
<p>五金交易、昨因天　、兼之僑胞遇害紀念、各固業祗有半天買賣、是以頗覺冷落、如東白鐵緣各帮來電止辦、所以均改辦美白鐵、致此貨交易比前稍見健旺、行情因之有扶搖直上之勢、計四十八張每担估十九兩二錢半、二十八號售二十兩、二十六號十八兩七錢半、二十四號十八兩、查各帮開出共有三四百担之多、其他馬口鐵·新鉛絲·白鐵瓦等雖均有開出、但行情一節、殊無軒輊云、</p>

<h3>欲速則不達</h3>
<p>— 都美</p>
<p>「欲速則不達」、「網細不漏魚」、所有一切類似格言式的成語、現在大都逐漸被我相信了、這、並没有什麽特殊的原因、不過是年齡漸大、經騐較多、自然給我的閱歷吧了、在我、並不覺得可喜、我只感到我童眞逐漸的消失、專門在大樹底下乘蔭凉的生活、已無形中宣判了破産、雖還不需我去摚什麽大風、抵什麽巨浪、可是在相當的範圍内、總得要我去照顧一番、呵、那終日嬉戲、見着油瓶倒了也與我無關的生活、今生恐也休想了、十六歲以前的情景、時時要在我腦海裏泛着歷歷的波紋、年華和天眞、却偏偏不斷地在互相排斥、各相背馳、可惡的年華、毫不知趣地在一秒不讓地增加上去、那可寳貴的「天眞」、無形地便被她逐漸摧瑴、逐漸侵蝕、推之不去的是年華、挽之不留的却是天眞呵、呀、消失在那裏去了</p>
<p>姊姊的出嫁、便是個極好的證明、雖然她婆家在當地是數一數二的人家、可是四五年來、她已是兩個孩子的母親了、那一雙可愛的寳貝呵、却是她靑春消失的主因、再想到我們的母親呢、撫育我們姊妹七人、人卽使是鐵鑄的、也得磨亮了吧、慢說别的、就連我這爲人姊的、從最近的以往起、爲了一個十歲的小妹妹、還不知擔了多少心、受了多少累、目下又盡照料弟弟的責任了、</p>
<p>小妹妹在今年正月、由我領來此地進學校、因爲她年齡太小、初次離開慈母的懷抱、加之最大要點、不懂本地話、她因不懂别人的、别還更不懂她的哩、她非但講的一口純土語、並且還雜有許多幼童所有的而成年人不大慣用俗話、在這種情形之下、無住校之可能、於是住在我的宿舍裏、天天我得送她到附近我校的愛國女學附小去走讀、幸虧愛國是我的母校、倒還有照應的地方、可是半年來、照料她的飲食起居、饑寒飽餓、尤其是初來不久那次的生病、飯太蹩脚、吃不慣、弄得我手足無措、當時、我好像受了一種驚嚇、思想到母親撫養我等的辛苦、從一把八寸的毛囝、一直撫養到這麽大、再施之以教育、這是何等的勞苦呢、跟着我就重新立願、母恩是應該一一地報答的、呵、天下偉大的慈母呀、您對於人類的貢獻、是多麽精絶卓絶、</p>
<p>最近呢、小妹妹雖然回去、弟弟却又來了、我將照料妹妹的心、可以說移植到他的身上來了、他不大吃得來本地菜、在可能範圍内、我總得設法使他能夠下餐、好了、這樣一來、我必得吃過中飯才得出去、下午在六點鐘以前、總得趕回學校、否則、我便心神不定、在外面的時光、尤其是當我關照他等我後而不能准時趕回時、更其急了、昨天就是這樣、「弟弟、我出去了、定准回來吃晚飯、」「好、等你着、」</p>
<p>也是爲了寫成一篇稿子、於是昏昏沉沉地便不介意花去了過量的時間、包飯作已經送飯來、朋友們留我吃過飯再走、可是、我那成呢、連忙捲拾紙筆、雨傘、拿了就跑、調車時、又買了些零星食物、不免又耽擱了一些時光、待到北站、便饑、不擇食地根本忘了先看一看三路呢、還是一路的共公汽車、緊忙跳上去、買好了票子、不多時、車身載着衆客移動了、我心算略告了一些安慰、不消一刻鐘、就可到校了、六點半還不怎麽算遲我的雜亂思潮還未爾靖下來的時候、查票這朋友來向我查票、就此打斷了我混雜的思潮、車子逐漸灣向西首、我知事情有點不妙、又要開回廠裏加「軋士林」、也就是要多耽誤幾分鐘、這又引起我剛被打斷的、煩燥與焦急、</p>
<p>「喂、密司金、你往眞茹去嗎、」</p>
<p>「不、回學校」這聲音於我很熟悉、不待抬頭看、便斷定是在該汽車公司裏辦事的許先生、我便隨口這樣回應他、</p>
<p>「呵、你錯了、怎麽好到三路來呢、我以爲你往眞茹去呢、」</p>
<p>「呀、我可不注意呵、這才是荒天下之大唐、我從來没有這樣糊塗過、我急得攪昏了、還虧得被你瞧見、」我感到異常慚愧、焦急與煩燥、層層加緊、逼近我心理、這時、我懊恨極了、爲什麽如此粗心、不被人家笑不識字、也得被人笑我太不仔細、</p>
<p>「好、不關事、仍請上這車子、到廠外下來再調、」許先生和那倦熟識的查票員、見我如此焦急和赦顔的神色、都同聲的對我這般說、好似含有安慰的口吻、並且那檢票員還向許先生說、「你送她上車、對買票的講一聲、此票有效、」</p>
<p>在這樣的過程中、當然已換掉一部路車、許先生陪我在虬江路等了好久、才見有一部車來、標是標的「１」號、但往眞茹開的、又在等、倒好、不隔一霎時、來的又是「１」號、但又不是往江灣的、底下標明「入廠」、並且裏面也空無乘客、這樣一來、計共經過了四部車子、以五分鐘一部計算、五四便二十分鐘過去了、除了最初那部到廠裏加「軋士林」的車子不算、還又另換了一部車、照算起來、無論如何是不止二十分鐘了、一直等到第五部上、去了、誰知又開到廠裏、這次不是「加軋士林」、而是換隻新喇叭、同時、那些開車的賣票的、碰到一起、還在互說笑話、可是、他們那裏知道乘客底我、在心急如火呢、</p>
<p>回到學校、時已七點三刻、計共損去四十分鐘、我於是深深地感到、（欲速則不達」、「網細是絶不會走魚」的、無形中、給了我一個教訓、</p>
<h3>吳文敬女士</h3>
<p>— 冰攝</p>
<h3>門房之女</h3>
<p>— 語溪</p>
<p>我校的門房是一個高個子的北邊人、姓蔡、人家都呼他爲老蔡、因爲他的年紀有點老了、但是他的精神、還是少年人的精神、面是紅潤潤的、眼角上常是掛着和藹的微笑、一種老成持重的態度、是會令人肅然起敬的、</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>我校創始之初、他就進來作門房了、其間學校不知經過多少滄桑變故、校長也不知換了多少、學生是每年蛻變、舊的去、新的來、像旅客一樣、就是教員也莫有一個二十年前曾在我校教課的、而現在仍在我校的、祇有他、門房、從没有調動過、他作我校門房的來歷是與我校的生命史同樣長、他是我們的掌故、有時他和同學或任何人談起學校往昔的種種情况、有如八九十歲的老頭爲孩子們講「長毛」那樣地津津有味、</p>
<p>他的薪俸在校工之中要算最大的、同學對於他亦頗多好感、每到學期終了、或有給他一塊或兩塊錢作爲他送信的酬勞的、這樣克勤克儉地做了很多年頭、當然他是頗有點積蓄的了、據說在所有校工以及校門口開店人家之中、他是最富裕的了、</p>
<p>每個人都這樣相信的、</p>
<p>但據確實調查、校工中最有錢、要算那做宿舍茶房的老汪、其次要算姓李的本地跑差、老蔡祗挨得第三、說他最富、其實是冤枉他的、不過你寃枉他、他也並不見氣、他祇笑笑、慢慢說着、「哈哈、誰都這樣希望的囉、祇是事不從願呀、」</p>
<p>有時他接着作一些慨嘆、「這些年頭、單單家裏油鹽柴米一點開銷、已夠使人吃緊了、」</p>
<p>他的家、就在校門口、計平房三開間、家門口、開設糖菓店、零吃點心以至日用物品都賣、生意頗好、但據老蔡自己告訴我們、做學生子生意眞難、不放賬、生意小、放放賬、那末討賬的時候、眞累死人、而且無論如何緊、每年賬頭裏總有多少虧折的「所以像我這爿店、」他說、「每年能夠開銷過、已經很滿足的了、」</p>
<p>話是實情、我校同學、四方八路人都有、四川人、廣東人、東三省人、還有來自海外的華僑、他們吃用不算錢、但偏歡喜賒、比如他說、</p>
<p>「喂、麵包一隻、茄菲一杯寫寫、」或者說、</p>
<p>「喂、那兩瓶汽水記記我賬、」</p>
<p>這時誰能夠說「不行一定要現付」的話、或者指給他看那張貼在壁上的「承蒙賜顧概叨現惠」的紅紙條、當然只有賒給他、一做賬、半年之内便會不知不覺欠得很多錢、有些人、欠了錢、非等你再三討、他不想到還、或者就是討、他也會明天後天下禮拜這樣推延下去、直到推無可推的時候、才還你幾塊欠轉幾塊、甚至於還是說没有錢還、遇到這種人、個個要押他行李、那便麻煩死、結果總便馬虎了事了、</p>
<p>的、…………</p>
<p>老蔡的家裏、還有他的老妻和愛女、店裏還雇有夥計兩名、連他自己一共五個人吃飯、他女兒是在附近某初級中學讀書的、那筆讀書用費也是我們的門房常計算在心頭的、</p>
<p>他女兒年紀還只有十六七歲光景、因爲她讀書的地方離家近、所以是走讀的、她很用功、據我校幾個慣於早起的同學說、每天早晨總會聽見她在她房裏朗讀英文、讀了一時書、然後挾了書包上學去、到四點鐘散學才回家來、她回家之後並不到外面什麽地方玩、她只帮同她母親佬浣衣淘米洗菜等工作、有時還坐在店裏相帮賣東西、寫賬、假如你在店堂間裏不見她人、望望河灘上也不見她影子、那時她一定又在臥室裏做算學習題或演習英作文無疑、</p>
<p>她身段小巧、面貌也生得端整、人又聰明活潑、所以我校同學常常歡喜借買東西爲題由而得到同她攀談的機會、這事、那天眞的姑娘、是並不表示不願意的她同她們談談、有時她還要他們爲她解釋功課上的疑難、這時、那被請求的人、不問自己對於這門功課是内行或門外漢、是没有不慨然允諾了她的請求的、……</p>
<p>我校同學作她義務教師的頗不少、</p>
<p>這暑假、她初中畢業了、畢業班她是第一名、此番我校第一次招生、她來投考預科一年級、評閱結果、她的名次也在前面、她父親看見我校錄取新生榜上有她女兒的名字、歡喜得不得了、他常常說、</p>
<p>「這是先生們帮忙的、」其實他又何嘗不料到他女兒是必定會考取的呢、他對於他女兒抱有無窮的希望、他願負任何負担、爲她讀書、爲她謀幸福、</p>
<p>而蜜絲蔡也在在給他父親以不少的光榮、她非但功課好、且在球塲上、也顯過身手的、在她所新近畢業的初級中學裏、她是女子籃球隊隊長、半年以前、她們的女子隊同我校的女子隊、曾在我校球塲上交鋒過、那時她是打後衞的、</p>
<p>欣喜我校下半年又增多一個籃球女將了、……</p>
<p>我們偶然談起蔡女士升學我校的事曾有人說笑話、「父親做門房、什麽都便宜、惟有一件事吃虧、便是不能同男子通情書、哈哈、」</p>

<h3>英國開造最大水上飛機德國獨霸陸上飛機勢優</h3>
<p>— 雋山</p>
<p>英國人的句誇張的話說、他們是統轄着海中波浪、這本是指船隻講的、但自水上飛機勃興以來、驕傲的英國人、竟也不肯給人家奪去霸權、所以現在開造一艘世界上最大的水上飛機、已在南新浦登動工了、</p>
<p>這艘飛機、造竣之後、不但是世界上最大的飛機、也要算是最富麗繁華的一艘了、雖然他的形狀大小和德國最大的ＤＯ丨Ｘ號差不多、但載客可以較多、速率較大、舒適奢華、也要高的多哩、這機的定名、還未宣布、祇知道是維格士Ｖickere公司造的、裝的是Ｒolls-Ｒcyce的“Ｂuzzard”</p>
<p>摩托、</p>
<p>他的馬力、同Ｄo丨X號相等、但所用引擎、却祇有六隻、Ｄo丨X號要用到十二雙呢、每隻引擎、有一千匹馬力、是裝在機的單翼上的四個座子裏的、最大速度、可至一小時一四五英里、通常是一小時一百二十英里、這機可載四十個乘乘客、外加七個船員、乘客也不是像大多的商業飛機强要擠在一堆、他差不多有美國頭等閱覽火車的舒適呢、每個乘客都有寬大的睡舖、還有一間私室、膳食也是優良更有瞭望室預備、</p>
<p>這艘飛機、是英國航空部下令製造的、雖則他的用處還未宣布、但猜來總是預備去飛行各殖民地的、從英國飛到印度這件事、　則Ｒ丨１０１號飛船出了毛病、　是要舉行的、</p>
<p>雖是全用純鋼造的、這水上飛機却是極輕、極靈巧的、乘客乘滿後、他祇能飛行一千英里、但要是不載乘客、却能很安穩的不差陸飛過大西洋呢、</p>
<p>我們同時也可轉到陸上飛機一方面去看看、無疑的、德國是覇佔着無上的優勢、現在在使用的最大的陸上飛機、是一架仁克的Ｌufthansa　Junkers、在柏林倫敦間載客、那機連船員可載二十個人、</p>
<h3>紐約職業婦女生活</h3>

<p>（七）生活冩眞</p>
<p>曼米在中午有三刻鐘的時間進膳、若在很忙碌的日子、那末祇准離開半小時、這種情形大概在减價期中碰得、或許有幾個星期六日也是這樣、曼米於中午必須到更衣室裏、披了外衣方始跑出去找地方吃東西、她的店裏本有膳室供給職員進餐、不過曼米和她的同事願在中午離店進食、店裏的膳室比較好些、東西也不貴、跑出店外、可以多找地方吃東西、曼米的意思一刻鐘儘夠吃飯了、大半的中午曼米跑上一家藥店、站在蘇達水櫃外吃些山明治和冰淇淋、伊常常覺得法蘭西式餅糕的可口、她很願意拿精美的糕餅來代替山明治、一家意大利麵店出賣一碟熱麵和一杯咖啡、取資二角五分、美味的乳餅放在檯上任意取食、至於小食店裏食品種類、更覺繁多、曼米常覺得她跑上這些地方去、便過賞她的餐費、因爲那些食物實在是引人埀涎、吃飯的時候、幾個女子往往同吃、售貨女郎與打包者地位截然不同、一個人從打包畢業後方纔給她一本售貨簿、這個便是曼米的企望、她想做一個售貨女郎、她們的薪水可多至每星期二十元、有時候佣錢有四元之多、要做一個售貨員、她必須滿十八歲、並須在他店得有經騐、或從本店上升的、</p>
<p>在吃飯的時候、女郎們無非談些店裏的事、偶爾也談談個人的事、像衣服問題、男朋友、及家庭齟齬等事、她們在吃東西時並不多躭擱、</p>

<h3>Zhang Xueliang's Telegram Condemning Shi Yousan</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Xueliang telegraphed on the 23rd, saying, "To all newspaper offices: For several months, reports from various sources have stated that Shi Yousan, Commander-in-Chief of the 13th Route Army, has been inciting military sentiment and secretly plotting rebellion. In the areas where his troops are stationed and nearby, he has forcibly recruited civilian workers, extorted funds, arbitrarily requisitioned supplies and vehicles, and confiscated weapons from local security forces, causing countless disturbances. The people's appeals have been heard daily. Recently, his rebellious behavior has become even more obvious. In recent days, he has been detaining vehicles along the roads, moving troops, ambushing nearby garrison troops, and carrying out attacks north in several directions. His vanguard troops advanced to Shijiazhuang on the evening of the [date], openly declaring that they would take Beiping and Tianjin. All his treacherous plots have been confirmed. It is his duty as a soldier to diligently obey orders. Last year, when the national army was in trouble, he suddenly spied on the Central Plains before the entire campaign was completed, defying orders and raising troops. Fortunately, the Central Government was generous and gave him preferential treatment, and he was still recruited. I was ordered to take over the military affairs of the North, and his unit was placed under my command. I exhausted my efforts and did my best to comfort and appease him. I repeatedly pleaded with the Central Government for the reorganization and payment of his troops, and I invited them to accept my advice. He also swore to heaven and earth that he would obey orders. The documents are all preserved and can be verified. My handling of everything was always in line with the Central Government's overall goal of eliminating civil war and ensuring unity. I was humble in dealing with matters and generous to others. Comrades at home and abroad should be aware of this. Even when his rebellious actions were exposed and he was carrying out incursions, I still tolerated him, ordering the garrison troops not to lightly use force without a final order. All this was out of concern for peace and to avoid war. If there was a glimmer of hope, I always thought of urging him to reflect and extricate himself from his misguided path, so as to jointly maintain the situation of peace. How could I have known that he harbored evil intentions and acted recklessly, launching a cunning plan and rushing forward? He clearly had ulterior motives and intended to subvert the party and the country. Since the completion of unification, construction has begun, and the people's livelihood has not yet been established. Internal and external troubles have come one after another. The Central Government is worried about danger, and the military is campaigning to suppress the Communists. Before Commander-in-Chief Chiang entered Jiangxi, his earnest admonishments were still ringing in my ears. At this time, he is willing to be the leader of the rebels. Does he still have a conscience? In short, he is treacherous, stubborn, and deluded, disgracing soldiers and shaming the nation. He is not only intolerable by national law, but also abandoned by all people. I have the responsibility to pacify and have failed to transform him. I am deeply remorseful in my heart. Considering that it is my responsibility to protect the land and the people, and seeing that he is plotting to endanger the foundation of the country and harm the people's lives, his crimes are clear, and I dare not be lenient again. In addition to repeatedly reporting the fact of his rebellion to the Central Government, I have been ordered to supervise the various armies and carry out the campaign. I have already ordered my officers and soldiers to advance and attack by the appointed day. At the same time, Commander-in-Chief Liu of our Southern Route Group Army has also led his troops across the Yellow River and advanced north. The troops are advancing rapidly, and the soldiers are excited, vowing to serve the party and the country in quelling the chaos and annihilating the rebels. The situation of the campaign will be reported in succession. I respectfully announce my sincerity and ask for your clear guidance. Zhang Xueliang respectfully bowed, Deputy Secretary Seal."</p>

In the midst of a desperate battle with the communists, he suddenly received alarming news of the Korean massacre, Shi Yousan's rebellion, and the invasion of Guangdong and Guangxi into Hunan and Jiangxi. He rushed back to Nanchang overnight. After reviewing reports from all sides, he realized that these four events were interconnected. At this moment of life and death, there is no time to waste. We must unite to resist foreign aggression and pacify internal unrest. He will never change his position on personal advancement or retreat for the benefit of the party and the country.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Foreign Insults and Diplomacy (3)</h3>
<p>The necessary preparations for China's diplomacy today should be to establish a clear policy, as briefly discussed in yesterday's commentary. Now, based on the facts, let us take a step back and discuss further. The occurrence of diplomatic events is generally not accidental. They are not like unexpected storms. Given China's weakness over the past century, its position has become the center of attention for the world's powers. The unequal treaties signed with various countries over the years are sufficient to cause diplomatic disputes. In particular, Japan's determination of its continental policy is tantamount to treating China as its quasi-colony. Its officials and citizens, both high and low, have been chanting their so-called positive policies for Manchuria and Mongolia and tough policies towards China, which have long resounded throughout the sky. Moreover, its illegal activities in various parts of Northeast China, relying on unequal treaties, are innumerable. All of this has long shown the hidden worries and great difficulties in China's diplomatic future with Japan. Any event can happen at any time, without a fixed place or date, and the severity or difficulty of the situation is not difficult to predict. If our diplomatic authorities could have addressed various issues that could potentially lead to serious situations and formulated response strategies to the best of their ability, then at least the regret of being at a loss in diplomatic emergencies could have been reduced. However, in reality, it is highly questionable whether the diplomatic authorities have paid attention to this. The issues of Korean immigration to Northeast China, mixed residence in the interior, and land rental for commerce have long harbored seeds of disaster. Even without the occurrence of the Wan Incident, China should have raised these issues with the Japanese side to negotiate a solution and eliminate the source of trouble. Why treat them with such indifference and neglect? We must wait until disaster strikes before starting negotiations on the matter and still fail to dig up the root of the trouble. If we are like this now, the future will be even more dangerous. This is something that our diplomatic officials should deeply consider today. Taking another step back, the Chinese government has long declared a revolutionary diplomacy. Even if our diplomatic authorities cannot eliminate the root of trouble in advance, they can adhere to the principle of not giving in and make a solemn protest with an indomitable spirit when an event occurs and the two countries negotiate. Even if we cannot advance and defeat others, we can retreat and defend ourselves, without being preempted by others. However, in reality, let us put the past aside for now. Ever since the Wan Incident and the Korean expulsion of Chinese incidents occurred, we have been talking about negotiations and protests every day, but the Japanese armed protection of the excavation of canals in Wanbaoshan remains the same. The cry of "Kill all the Hu people" throughout Korea has not stopped. Both the Wan Incident and the Korean Incident were planned and prepared actions by the Japanese. Clues can be found by searching carefully. They cannot shirk their responsibility. Where justice lies, why should we be weak? National rights are lost, and overseas Chinese die tragically. The words of the Wanbaoshan farmers, "Since the country cannot protect us weak, we have no choice but to rise up and defend ourselves," and the reports of the tragic deaths of overseas Chinese who fled back from Korea are filled with tears and blood, tearing at the heart. Anyone with blood and spirit cannot but be filled with grief and indignation. However, the Japanese remain stubborn. They only expressed regret over the Korean Incident and promised appropriate compensation. For the Wan Incident, they even made unreasonable demands for compensation for the losses of Korean farmers. Recently, Mr. Shigemitsu visited Beijing and only talked about pending issues, not the current serious negotiations. It is clear that they treat us as if we are an unguarded country. When we recall the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, the killing of several foreigners resulted in the invasion of the Eight-Nation Alliance, the destruction of our old capital, and the huge amount of indemnity that is still paid annually. People treat us like this, and we treat others like that. If we do not fight for this, what is the value of having a country? However, the more the people are angry, the more calm the negotiations seem. To this day, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has never made an orderly report to the public on the progress of the two incidents and the negotiation documents to allow the people to understand the truth and discuss it together. Moreover, judging from the Japanese newspaper reports, the original text of the Japanese reply and China's protest note seem to indicate that the Chinese government intends to severely suppress the unstable words and deeds of the Chinese people. Therefore, the Japanese reply ends with the words "fully agree with the Japanese government." This is indeed weakness, and there is no way to deny it. As for Ambassador Wang Rongbao's report to the Ministry stating that the Japanese side failed to prevent the Korean Incident in advance but made great efforts to control it after the incident, his casual words relieve the Japanese of unlimited responsibility and show that he is ignorant of the big picture and does not know what diplomacy is. All of this is something that our diplomatic authorities should deeply consider today. In short, China's national power is weak, and we cannot curb the rampant violence of the powerful. The responsibility borne by the government authorities is even more onerous. We should work hard in the spirit of revolution so that we can renew internal affairs and resist foreign insults. The enthusiastic spirit of the people is a powerful backing for the government. In times of diplomatic emergency, it must not be suppressed, giving the people greater disappointment. This is something that our diplomatic authorities must not be unaware of.</p>

<h3>London Conference Adopts U.S. Proposals</h3>
<p>Resolving Germany's Economic Crisis</p>
<p>Banking Community Has Agreed to Cooperate</p>
<p>Unsecured Short-Term Loans</p>
<p>French Representatives Insist on Opposition</p>
<p>After the Seven-Nation Conference Concludes</p>
<p>Three-Nation Conference Will Follow</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Washington, 22nd: Secretary of State Stimson telephoned the White House, saying that the London Conference had adopted proposals satisfactory to the United States. According to official sources, major world banks have agreed to cooperate in President Hoover's new plan.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 22nd: The Seven-Nation Conference held a plenary session today to discuss the short document obtained by the Finance Committee after studying for five hours yesterday. Its contents are still kept secret. It is said that what was discussed was the easiest way to restore Germany's financial credit. The plenary session exchanged views on the root causes of the financial panic without involving political aspects. The conference ultimately decided to focus on the most important task of restoring Germany's financial credit. The meeting lasted for three hours and decided to refer certain issues to the Finance Committee for review and report to the conference tomorrow. U.S. Secretary of State Stimson told reporters today that he is optimistic about the progress of the London Conference. He said that there is now real progress and expects things to be completed tomorrow. The mood of the meeting is quite good. The situation is indeed difficult, but there is still hope. The financial authorities later gathered outside and consulted for a long time. A communiqué was issued at night, stating that an agreement had been reached on the terms of the report to be submitted to the plenary session for approval tomorrow.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 22nd: Official sources claim that the Committee of Finance Ministers has agreed on the terms of the report to be submitted to the plenary session for approval tomorrow. One of the terms is to extend the 25 million pounds of debt that the German National Bank must pay on August 16th for 90 days. The report also briefly mentions ways to prevent foreigners from withdrawing deposits from Germany and to provide general assistance to Germany, as well as special assistance to the German National Bank. It is estimated that the procedure recommended by the committee will be undertaken by the bankers themselves, immediately releasing loans to help Germany restore its credit. After the London Conference considers this report, the Bank for International Settlements intends to establish a committee to consider the points that have been raised.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 22nd: If German Chancellor Brüning brings back less than expected when he returns home tomorrow, it will be largely due to the attitude of the French. The French have always held their attitude before the meeting, unwilling to lend new debts to Germany without sufficient guarantees. Stimson used Germany as a leaky basin in his talks yesterday, wanting to pour more water into it, but the holes must be plugged. British Chancellor of the Exchequer Snowden and French Prime Minister Laval contradicted each other in their words, and the efforts of the British and American representatives to propose new debts completely failed. Germany can only lament this. According to French sources, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer advocated that British, American, and French banks should share short-term debts equally, saying that so far, American banks have provided 60% of short-term debts, British banks 35%, and the French only 5%. The French Prime Minister strongly opposed this suggestion. According to a Reuters interview in New York, Wall Street believes that the London Conference has failed and is quite disappointed. Today, the British Emperor invited important representatives attending the meeting to participate in the garden party.</p>
<p>▲National News, London, 22nd: The London Seven-Nation Conference will be adjourned tomorrow. Its only results are: (1) A temporary solution to save Germany's finances. This solution has been drafted by the Financial Subcommittee, and its main points are the extension of short-term debt of 350 million pounds, as well as the allowance of another type of debt, the amount of which is still under consideration. (2) Brüning has proposed that various countries organize an international banker inspection team to go to Germany to inspect the real financial situation and decide whether the current rescue methods are sufficient to help Germany overcome the crisis. If this proposal is adopted, there may be various</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>International meetings will follow to seek a final solution. The financial misfortunes of Germany and the re-emergence of the reparations issue may also be expected. France is the focus of the entire issue. In the past 24 hours, a very important change has taken place in the friendship between Germany and France. The passionate feelings that were established before have now been extinguished by cold water. Laval, Briand, and Flandin still insist on using long-term loans as an exchange condition for political concessions, but because Germany firmly opposes political concessions, France is also disgusted with temporary relief measures. The communiqué issued by the British Foreign Office clearly acknowledges that the French attitude is an obstacle to the progress of the meeting. London newspapers are also attacking France wantonly, and France is clearly in a solitary position, with a tendency to disregard public opinion and offend the public.</p>
<p>▲National News, Berlin, 22nd: According to reliable reports, after the London Conference, the tripartite conference of Britain, the United States, and Germany will continue on Saturday or Sunday at the Hubertusstock hunting lodge on the shores of Lake Weiblin in Germany. British Foreign Secretary Henderson will accompany the German Chancellor and others back to Berlin after the London Conference ends, while British Prime Minister MacDonald will fly to Germany on Friday. U.S. Secretary of State Stimson will also travel to Germany in the same car. Perhaps Henderson, Stimson, Brüning, Curtis, and others can exchange views and explain various issues while returning to Germany in the same car. Because British newspapers are dissatisfied with France for the failure of the London Conference, British public opinion believes that if France does not change its attitude quickly, Britain, Germany, and the United States may form an economic alliance.</p>
<h3>German President Issues New Decree to Increase Minting of Silver and Copper Subsidiary Coins</h3>
<p>To Supplement the Shortage of Circulating Gold</p>
<p>Departure Tax Implemented</p>
<p>Left and Right Extremist Factions Join Hands</p>
<p>Greatly Affecting the Future of the Political Situation</p>
<p>▲National News, Berlin, 22nd: Today, the President issued a new decree to increase the circulating cash in the country from 1.3 billion marks to 1.9 billion marks, including the minting of 500 million marks in silver coins and 100 million marks in copper coins. According to the old regulations, the German people should share about 20 marks of silver, nickel, copper, and other auxiliary coins per person, but now it has been increased to 30 marks. In this way, the financial aspect may be slightly loosened.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Washington, 22nd: The U.S. Department of Commerce recently released figures explaining some of the reasons for Germany's financial difficulties. Germany's trade deficit in the seven years ending December 1930 was 1.5 billion yuan, and Germany paid 2.45 billion yuan in reparations during these seven years. To meet these expenses, Germany had to borrow 3.835 billion yuan.</p>
<p>▲National News, Berlin, 22nd: The previously issued order that all Germans leaving the country should pay a departure tax of 100 marks has been implemented at midnight today. As a result, all trains leaving Germany are deserted, and domestic holidays and travels in Germany are thriving instead.</p>
<p>▲National News, Berlin, 22nd: Germany's two major hostile parties, the National Socialist Party and the Communist Party, have reached a reconciliation and are joining hands today. This matter clearly affects the future of the German political situation, because their alliance today is solely for the right to veto the dissolution of the Prussian parliament. However, if they unite to confront the federal government one day, the situation will inevitably develop seriously.</p>
<h3>Mexican Expulsion of Chinese Incident</h3>
<p>Authorities Have Ordered Investigation</p>
<p>▲National News Agency, Nogales, 22nd: The Mexican Anti-Chinese Committee attacked five Chinese shops and robbed them of cash, firearms, etc. After a serious protest from the Chinese Consul, the Governor of Sonora has ordered a detailed investigation today.</p>
<h3>Spain Still Disturbed and Uneasy</h3>
<p>Will Endanger the Safety of the Republic</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Madrid, 22nd: The disturbances in Spain are increasing and will endanger the safety of the Republic, so the government has decided to eliminate them. The leaders of the disturbances in Madrid and Seville have been arrested, and their residences have been sealed. The government has issued an order that workers must give ten days' notice of strikes, and those who violate the order will be severely punished. At the same time, a serious armed conflict occurred in Seville today, and strikers in Barcelona threw very powerful bombs in the city center, destroying 1,500 telephone lines.</p>
<h3>The Lindberghs Will Fly to China Soon</h3>
<p>Safety Equipment is Ready</p>
<p>▲Reuters, New York, 23rd: The famous American aviator Lindbergh will travel to the Far East with his wife and is scheduled to fly out within the next week. They will pass through Alaska and Siberia and arrive in Japan and China. Various safety equipment are being arranged, including a water-resistant package. If the plane touches the water, this package will automatically open, containing a small boat with sails, as well as essential food and a full set of wireless equipment.</p>
<h3>British House of Commons Pays Attention to the Missing Case of Sambien in China</h3>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 22nd: The missing case of the British Sambien in China caused various questions in the House of Commons today. Undersecretary of State Dalton said that Ambassador Lampson had learned that the Chinese government's investigation committee had reported this matter to the Chinese government, but Ambassador Lampson had not yet seen the original report. Ambassador Lampson had made serious representations to the Chinese government. Conservative Party Austin Chamberlain said that the British government must keep this case in mind when abolishing consular jurisdiction negotiations. Conservative Party Cayser said that the British government should urge the Chinese government to appoint a British representative to join the subsequent investigation. Dalton replied that the British government could not urge the Chinese government to appoint a British representative. Foreign Secretary Henderson attaches great importance to this matter, and Ambassador Lampson will continue to do his best to negotiate with the Chinese government until the matter is clarified.</p>
<p>Telegrams</p>
<h3>Telegram from Beiping</h3>
<p>For the information of all newspaper offices: a telegram just received from Chairman Liu of Kaifeng and other comrades, which reads: "Having read the circular telegram of the auspicious day, we praise justice, denounce treacherous rebels, offer sincere words of advice, which are stricter than axes and saws. We admire it repeatedly beyond words. Since the completion of unification, governance has been rough, internal and external troubles have come one after another. The common people eagerly desire good governance, and patriots are keen to save the country. The current plan is that without internal pacification, we cannot resist foreign invasion; without eliminating selfishness, we cannot collectively make progress. The survival of the nation hangs by a thread; all who have blood and breath share this sentiment. However, Shi Yousan has lost his conscience and acted against reason, prioritizing personal gain over public duty, plotting rebellion, and taking advantage of the situation to launch it suddenly. Public safety in North China once again faces war. This hinders the progress of construction in the near term and affects the safety of the nation in the long term. As alarming news spreads, we all deeply condemn it. We still remember when the Commander-in-Chief previously inspected the troops in Jiangxi and sent a telegram to all comrades in the country, offering diligent comfort and earnest encouragement. How long ago was that? How could he be so forgetful? This officer is now raising troops to rebel. His deliberate and long-planned intention is nothing more than to profit from this difficult situation and expedite his theft. To sum up this officer, he is fickle and treacherous, with a dangerous and poisonous heart, lost on his way and unwilling to return, persisting in evil and showing no repentance. Not only is he intolerable by law, but also a profound disgrace to soldiers. We and others, who have been soldiers since childhood, dedicated ourselves to defending the country.

<p>▲Telegram from Zhengzhou For the public attention of Shen Xin and other newspaper offices: The Fresh People are instigated to invade our farmland, killing wantonly, with cruelty and brutality unheard of in history. Such disregard for humanity makes them enemies of the world. All merchants and citizens of the country are deeply indignant. We should request the National Government to engage in serious negotiations. All our citizens vow to be the backing. Zhengzhou Chamber of Commerce, Yang Yin,</p>
<p>○Telegram from Nanchang To all newspaper offices: The Japanese imperialists have been deliberately invading our Manchuria and Mongolia for more than a day. This time, because of the Wanbaoshan incident, they let the police open fire, killing and wounding more than 100 of our farmers. As if that were not enough, they extremely instigated Koreans to stage a major massacre in places such as Pyongyang and Incheon. Woe to our overseas compatriots, bearing grievances in foreign lands. It pains us to speak of it. We humbly implore our Central Government to uphold revolutionary diplomacy and lodge a serious protest with Japan, striving for a satisfactory resolution. All our countrymen, in particular, should sharpen our swords and be prepared, united as a diplomatic backing. While there is still a breath, we would not hesitate to die a hundred times. We respectfully telegraph our words, filled with indignation. Jiangxi Provincial Government, kowtowing.</p>
<p>○Telegram from Hankou To all newspaper offices: The Red bandits are being suppressed, but their nests remain, and if they are not eradicated completely, they will spread and be a cause for concern. Our Commander-in-Chief Jiang, and Dong, lead the troops, braving the summer heat and embarking on expeditions, vowing to sweep away the evil atmosphere, not allowing the poison to escape. Wherever their banners point, they conquer famous cities, such as Guangchang, Shicheng, and Ningdu. In less than a fortnight, they achieved successive victories. The Red bandits Zhu and Peng can be cleared with a glance. This is truly a good opportunity to eradicate the Red bandits. All who have blood and breath, who would not wholeheartedly support the Central Government, hoping to achieve complete success early, to eliminate the Red disaster forever, to save the people from suffering, and to guide humanity to peace? Moreover, at a time when strong neighbors are provoking troubles, stirring up chaos in the eastern borders, benefiting from our disturbances and unrest, and further engaging in aggression, if internal strife were to erupt again, it would truly affect diplomacy. Furthermore, Hubei, Henan, Fujian, and Guangdong are suffering from floods, with thousands of miles submerged, almost becoming a watery land. The suffering people are impoverished, and disaster relief has not yet begun. Already afflicted by natural disasters, how can they endure the calamity of war? If there are those who harbor sinister intentions, disregarding the greater good, taking advantage of the situation to launch a rebellion, it would be no different from hindering the suppression of the Red bandits, aligning themselves with the Red bandits, and increasing the Red disaster. It would also be no different from acting as an accomplice for the enemy, giving them the opportunity to invade, and betraying their own country. Furthermore, it would be no different from becoming enemies of hundreds of millions of disaster victims, increasing their suffering from hunger, drowning, and displacement, and isolating themselves from humanity. They would truly be public enemies of the state and great traitors to the nation. They would be difficult to forgive and impossible to tolerate. We must unanimously denounce them and have no turning back. Cheng Jun and others, as soldiers, have a responsibility to defend the country. Eradicating the chief villains is our only focus. We stand ready with weapons and horses, awaiting clear instructions.

<p>Special Essay</p>
<h3>A Study on the Transplantation of Korean People to the Northeast</h3>
<p>(Continued from the previous article) Bin</p>
<p>(III) Historical Examination of the Transplantation of Korean People to the Northeast</p>
<p>The transplantation of Korean people to the Northeast is not a recent event. Its historical evolution is of great importance to this issue. We should urgently trace its origins to understand the historical progress of this issue and use it as a reference for resolving it. However, our country's historical records and ancient books often neglect border issues, and there is even less information on the transplantation of Korean people to our land. As for the Japanese side, they fabricate historical facts and make far-fetched interpretations. For example, Yano and others have even written special books, claiming that the Northeast is not our country's territory. These kinds of absurd arguments are intended to confuse international opinion and benefit their acts of aggression. If we are not careful, we will be deceived and used by them without realizing it. For example, the Japanese also fabricate much of the historical fact of the transplantation of Korean people to our Northeast or deliberately make biased statements. If our countrymen do not examine them carefully and take them as a basis, they will spread errors and fall into their conspiracies, causing great mistakes. This is what we must pay close attention to when examining historical facts.</p>
<p>According to more reliable records in recent times, the transplantation of Korean people to our Northeast began after the early years of Guangxu. Before that, although there were Korean people who crossed the border to steal and cultivate land, it was not a formal transplantation. Wu Luzhen's "Report on Border Affairs in Yanji," compiled in the thirty-third year of Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty, states:</p>
<p>"When the Qing Dynasty established its rule in the Central Plains, Korea was listed as a vassal state. The way of paying tribute, exchanging envoys, and conducting trade was generally by crossing the Yalu River from Uiju in Korea and reaching Fengcheng in Shengjing. As for the area north of the Tumen River, it was a key area for the Qing Dynasty's foundation and was completely sealed off. The ban on illegal immigrants entering the country was extremely strict. Reading the clear edict of the early Qing Dynasty banning Jilin and the strict decree of patrolling the Tumen River in the years of Daoguang, it is clear that the people were extinct here for two hundred years, and Koreans even more so. In the early Qing Dynasty, the border between Jilin and Korea was extremely strict. If the people of the two countries privately crossed the Tumen River by one step, they would be executed by officials of the two countries, or they would be killed without exception. Therefore, not only were Korean people not allowed to cross the river, but also Chinese people who crossed the river without reason were clearly violating the strict ban."</p>
<p>This shows that in the early days of the Qing Dynasty, the three northeastern provinces were regarded as their birthplace, and the residence of people was prohibited, especially to prevent the transplantation of Korean people. The border between China and Korea was extremely strict. Koreans were not allowed to cross the river to violate our territory, and our people were not allowed to cross one step privately. The Yalu River was like a natural moat. This is a verifiable historical fact. However, the Japanese deliberately said that since the early Qing Dynasty, the area between Baishan and Heishui had become a vast wilderness without belonging. We can easily see what their words are intended for.</p>
<p>In the ninth year of Tongzhi, there was heavy rain and hail in Korea, and the country was extremely barren. Hungry people filled the roads. Korean people did not hesitate to violate the heavy ban, crossed the river and border, sold their wives and children, and begged for food. However, within a year, the Korean people who had families still returned to their homeland. Those who stayed in China were only male servants and female slaves. (At this time, in Hunchun and other places in Jilin, one son or one daughter of a Korean person could be exchanged for a bucket of rice.) At that time, there were only Korean people who were employed as servants and lived on food, but there were no Korean people who cultivated land across the border. In the early years of Guangxu, Dunhua County released wasteland and investigated land. There were Korean people who privately cultivated land in places such as Wailiudaogou, opposite Mount Mu in Korea. This was because the area near Hunchun was patrolled by troops sent by the assistant commander every year. Those who privately reclaimed fields and built houses were destroyed. However, places opposite Mount Mu were farther away from Hunchun, and patrols were slightly neglected. However, although there were Korean people who risked the ban to steal and cultivate land at that time, there were no Korean people who received wasteland to cultivate. The violation and intrusion of Korean people were by no means a formal transplantation.</p>
<p>In the seventh year of Guangxu, the Jilin General Ming'an supervised border defense. Wu Dacheng was approved to investigate the household registration of Korean refugees and assign them to the jurisdiction of Hunchun and Dunhua. It was not until this time that Korean people began to receive wasteland and rent land in our Yanbian territory. However, they had no land sovereignty at all. The Korean emperor was afraid of the emigration of his people and even asked our country to return the refugees. The document sent to the Ministry of Rites stated:</p>

Later, Deputy Commander Zhang believed that Wang still had to take on the frontline command, so it has been decided to appoint Tianjin Mayor Zhang Xueming as the commander-in-chief of martial law, with Guo Dianju, brigade commander of the Fourteenth Brigade, as the deputy commander, to strengthen prevention. Mayor Zhang has received an order from the executive headquarters. The city's Public Security Bureau is currently preparing for martial law.

<h3>Fu Shuangying's Talk on the Current Situation</h3>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: The circumstances of Fu Shuangying's visit to Bing have been reported in previous newspapers. The mission of Fu's visit is: (1) to inspect the situation in Shanxi; (2) to convey the intentions of Chiang and Zhang; (3) to solicit the opinions of various generals on the current situation. In the past two days, Fu visited various parties and exchanged opinions, which was very harmonious. The Shanxi generals Shang Zhen, Yang Aiyuan, Sun Chu, Song Zheyuan, Pang Bingxun, Fu Zuoyi, Rong Honglu, Zhang Huizhao, Zhou Dai, Li Shengda, Li Fuying, Yang Chengyuan, Yang Xiaoou, Feng Pengzhu, Yang Yaofang, Wang Jingguo, Zhao Chengshou, Li Runfa, etc., specially held a joint banquet at the Shanxi Hotel last night.</p>
<p>To welcome Fu and to remove the dust, after the banquet, a lengthy agreement was reached on the current situation. Fu's attitude was extremely optimistic. The reporter visited yesterday and recorded his conversation as follows: (Reporter asked) When did the military commander arrive in Shanxi? Fu (replied) I arrived here at 4:10 pm on the 16th of this month. (Asked) Can you tell us about the commander's experiences over the years? (Answered) I have been in the military for about 20 years, and have served as a brigade commander and military commander.</p>
<h2>Page 11</h2>
<p>In various battles, I am ashamed of my lack of achievements due to my limited talent and strength. Since the reorganization, I originally intended to return to the fields and recuperate, but I was entrusted by Vice-Chairman Zhang to be a military advisor, and last winter I was ordered to take over the Jingxing Mining Bureau. I have a great interest in industrial affairs, because the suffering of the people in our country for more than ten years has been unbearable. If I can contribute to a little production enterprise for the society, it would be much better than the dangers of war and would benefit a lot. I will study mining affairs carefully and gradually develop it, but whether I can achieve my wish can only be left to fate. (Asked) What is the mission of your visit? (Answered) I came here because the generals in Shanxi are mostly classmates and old friends. I was instructed by the Deputy Commander to come here to convey the overall situation in the North. It is more important to unite and reorganize than to destroy. Moreover, every man has a responsibility for the rise and fall of the country. At this critical moment of internal and external troubles, we soldiers are particularly important. The Third International is doing everything possible to provoke and destroy, and will not stop until China is no longer a country. How should we be responsible for prevention? If there are elements who are used by them, we should work together to drive out evil and support what is right, abandon selfishness and value righteousness, in order to maintain the national interest. How can we harm the people with selfish intentions? It is much better to conserve strength and build up energy to face the outside world with great courage than to engage in civil war in the country. I came here only based on this purpose. Fortunately, all the generals can meet each other with sincerity, and I am quite optimistic about the future of the overall situation. Regarding the Shanxi and Northwest armies, since the reorganization last year, it has been a complete plan, and they all belong to the same army, so there is no difference in treatment. Therefore, the Deputy Commander has repeatedly asked the Central Government to maintain the various armies at all costs to prevent disasters and consolidate the country. However, due to the hasty time and insufficient preparation, it was not possible to fulfill the wish immediately. Now that a considerable amount of time has passed, all the departments that have been announced and established will be treated the same as the Northeast, without any favoritism. Finally, he also said that although the Deputy Commander is only about thirty years old, he is extremely loyal and sincere in treating people, and often says that he can be friends with anyone and can be used by anyone. If someone tells him that someone is not good, he will say that it is his own fault, that he is not sincere enough to impress people, and that he is not wise enough to observe people. What can he blame others for? From this, we can see his character. As for the Vice Chairman's illness, he has now recovered and is currently in a period of recuperation. He will be discharged from the hospital in a few days and often meets with guests and news reporters to talk, but according to the doctor's advice, the talk time should be short and not too long. He had intended to go to Beidaihe for recuperation, but after persuasion from all parties, he is still recuperating in the hospital, which is more suitable than going to Beidaihe. He has now decided to recuperate in the hospital and will no longer go to Beidaihe. Fu also telegraphed Hou Zhencun, the director of the Jingxing Mining Bureau, yesterday, saying that at this time when rumors are rampant, the bureau's staff and workers should remain calm and work, and invited them to come to Jin to discuss everything. It can be seen that Fu's attitude is also quite calm.</p>

<h3>Wanbaoshan Becomes a Japanese Alert Zone</h3>
<p>▲Japanese Police Actually Expel Original Chinese Residents</p>
<p>Recent news from Jilin: Yesterday, someone came from Wanbaoshan to the province to report that as of the 14th, the Japanese, under supervision, directed Korean people and Shandong workers to dig through the ditches that had been leveled by the civilians before, and set up a total of 29 cloth tents. In the tents, a Japanese flag was erected high. Within three miles, our people were still not allowed to pass through, so the area had become a Japanese alert zone. Many people's houses have been occupied. So far, the negotiations on this case have been such that we have no way to expel the illegal occupying Koreans, while they have actually expelled the original Chinese residents, making it impossible for them to stay. The injustice of the matter is such.</p>
<p>The Wanbaoshan case in Changchun was originally a matter that could be resolved locally, but the Japanese side was unilaterally strong and overbearing, and carried new-style artillery to put too much pressure on us. Our people still know that the country is important and have never dared to confront the Japanese police directly, but sometimes they took advantage of their carelessness to dig through the soil and fill the moats, hoping to restore the original state of the farmland. When they saw the Japanese police coming, they fled and dispersed. Their plight is also pitiful. Unexpectedly, they are still arguing strongly and making alarming statements about one or two small things. For example, at noon on the 12th of this month, students from the Changchun Commercial Port Elementary School were giving speeches about the Wanbaoshan incident in the old city market. A Japanese military police officer, Inoue, disguised himself in Chinese clothes and mocked them from the side. A student, Chi Shirong, only thirteen years old, had a verbal argument with him and tore Inoue's gown. Inoue immediately grabbed the student and claimed that he had lost his watch and official documents. After our Public Security Bureau compensated for the loss, the matter was settled. The Japanese newspapers immediately published a headline, saying that the anti-Japanese trend in Changchun was intensifying, that Japanese military officials were beaten by the people for no reason, and that Japanese residents did not dare to go out. On the 13th, the Japanese consul stationed in Jilin suddenly declared to our authorities that more than 1,000 students in Dunhua were conducting a grand anti-Japanese propaganda campaign, fearing that an ominous event would soon break out. After investigation, it was learned that the commercial and academic circles of Dunhua had received a telegram from the Korean Chinese Chamber of Commerce about the situation of the overseas Chinese being harmed, and a special meeting was held to discuss and telegraph the provincial government for a serious protest, as a diplomatic backing. The Japanese side's creation of troubles has been like this recently.</p>

<h3>Mass Rally in Beiping by All Circles to Support Overseas Chinese and Oppose Japan</h3>
<p>▲ Resolution to Form a Committee to Support Overseas Chinese and Oppose Japan</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: The Beiping mass rally to support overseas Korean Chinese and oppose the Japanese movement was held yesterday (the 20th) at 9:00 AM in the Zhongshan Hall of Zhongshan Park. More than 300 people attended. The presidium consisted of eight people, including Chen Shiquan from the Municipal Party Department, Yang Shaoye from the Chamber of Commerce, Zheng Guocai from the Provincial Party Department, Liu Ying from the Farmers' Association, Zhang Deliu from the PingSui Special Party Department, Zhou Xuechang from the Education Association, Di Yingxian from the Municipal Government, and Hou Fu from the Labor Union. Chen Shiquan served as the Chairman. After the formal opening ceremony, the Chairman reported on the significance of the meeting, saying, in brief, "Today is the Beiping City mass rally to support Korean Chinese and oppose the Japanese movement. We should commemorate it with sorrow and grief. Since the Wanbaoshan Massacre on July 1st, Japan has provoked the emotions between China and Korea, using the Koreans as tools to massacre Chinese living in Korea. We should recognize two points about this: (1) This Korean anti-Chinese massacre was very methodical and was instigated and manipulated by the Japanese. This tragedy is not only heartbreaking for us but also leaves a major stain on human history. The responsibility for this should be borne by Japanese imperialism. (2) We should sympathize with the Chinese victims of the Korean massacre and hope that they realize the need to unite the weak nations' front. This meeting has two major tasks: (1) How to assist the overseas Chinese, and (2) How to resist Japanese imperialism. The overseas Chinese have suffered greatly this time. Our compatriots at home should provide assistance in spirit and materially. Some of our compatriots who suffered have already sacrificed themselves under the iron heel of imperialism. The responsibility of revenge rests on the surviving Chinese. We should urge the government to lodge a serious protest and have the spirit of enduring hardship and persevering. We should unite and resist Japanese imperialism, sever economic relations with it, and have the determination to fight Japanese imperialism to the death. We should not only inform the people of the whole country of this situation but also the people of the world. International propaganda is everyone's responsibility. Finally, we hope that the Koreans realize that the only way to maintain peace is for China and Korea to shake hands." Next, Zheng Guocai reported on the process. Finally, eleven proposals were passed: (1) The Chairman proposed a draft declaration of the conference and asked for its approval. (2) The Presidium proposed to send a telegram to the National Government, asking it to negotiate seriously with Japan and implement effective assistance, together with the draft telegram for approval. (3) The Presidium proposed to send a telegram of condolence to the affected overseas Chinese, together with the draft telegram for approval. (4) The Presidium proposed to send a telegram to the whole country to unite against Japan, together with the draft telegram for approval. (5) The Presidium proposed to issue a letter to the Korean people, together with the draft of the letter, for approval. (6) The Presidium proposed to carry out propaganda to the world to stop Japan's counter-propaganda. (7) The Presidium proposed to organize the Beiping Committee to Support Overseas Korean Chinese and Oppose Japan, responsible for planning and implementing the work of supporting overseas Chinese and opposing Japan, and to recommend the Party Department of Hebei Province, the Party Department of Beiping City, the Party Department of PingSui Railway, the Beiping General Chamber of Commerce, the Beiping Suburban Farmers' Association, the Beiping Education Association, the Beiping Large Vehicle Workers' Union, the Tram Workers' Union, the Newspaper Carriers' Union, the Journalists' Association, the PingSui Railway Union, Peking University, Beijing University, the Oriental Problems Research Association, the Beiping Bankers' Association, the Beiping Preparatory Committee for Autonomy, and other organizations to be members, asking for a public decision. (8) The Preparatory Committee for Autonomy proposed to raise funds to be remitted to Korea to provide relief to the overseas Chinese, with any party advancing the funds first and then being reimbursed after the funds were raised, with the amount being at least 10,000 yuan. (9) Ye Mengyuan proposed to suspend all entertainment in the city for three days. (10) Cui Jingyuan proposed to actively prepare for land reclamation to establish a clear diplomatic policy towards Japan. (11) Dong Lin proposed to send a telegram to warn Shi Yousan and others in Guangdong to lay down their butcher knives and unite against foreign enemies. All the above proposals were unanimously approved. The meeting adjourned at 1:30 PM. (21st)</p>
<h3>Shandong Brick, Tile, and Book Exhibition</h3>
<p>▲ Tens of Thousands of Visitors on the First Day</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Shandong Provincial Library, in order to awaken the attention and interest of all circles in preserving antiquities, has specially opened a brick, tile, and book exhibition. Today (21st) is the first day of the public exhibition. The brick and tile exhibition is set up in the reference book reading room on the ground floor of the north building of the library. On display are the Qin and Han bricks and tiles collected by Gao Zang in Weixian County. Numbers one and two are the twelve-character bricks of the Xiongnu peace treaty, one in yangwen (raised characters) and the other in yinwen (recessed characters). The famous twelve-character brick "Hai Nei Jie Chen" (All Subjects Within the Seas) was taken away by Japan. The value of the above two bricks can be compared to that of the Xiongnu. The remaining bricks and tiles, which were previously disclosed, are also on display. Also on display is the book "Shizhong Shanfang Wanyin Lou Yinwen" (Seal Imprints from the Ten Bell Studio and Ten Thousand Seal Building) by Chen Fusai of Weixian County, and "Xiao Pan Lu Zhuanwa Wenzi" (Brick and Tile Texts from the Little Climbing Cottage) edited by Xu Yinlin of Rizhao. The printing plates of Chen's book are kept by the Chen family, and each copy requires a price of over one hundred yuan. Xu's book is currently kept in the library, and the original plates are probably not easy to obtain. These are also on display. In addition, what is eye-catching is the four scrolls written by Li Wanyong of Korea, which are hung on the north wall. One scroll contains a poem that reads, "A hundred battles have won功名, the heavenly troops are full of yìqì, the three borders will never fight永不戰, this is my royal英." Another scroll reads, "Ten thousand miles of plains in Southern Manchuria, the scenery is broad and the autumn sky is vast. The battle迹跡留餘憤, even more cause the traveler to have暗愁." Another scroll reads, "Holy virtue transcends the 千古, royal威静四方, the common people now息戰, feel the long time of無事." Another scroll contains the four characters "Shoushan Fuhai" (Longevity Mountain and Blessed Sea). Under each scroll is the signature Yitang Li Wanyong, with two seals: one is the seal of Li Wanyong, and the other is "Yitang." Wang Xiantang, the librarian, has a postscript, which roughly says that Li Wanyong is a traitor who sold Korea. Our Chinese who sell antiquities to foreigners are also traitors, because antiquities are where the national culture is寄. The book exhibition is set up in the museum under the Hutian Yijiao building. On display are the Song, Yuan, and Ming rare books collected by Haiyuan Pavilion in the cabinet of the Grand Library, too many to be recorded. Also on display are the "You Huang Zuo Xiao Tu" (Seated and Whistling in a Bamboo Grove) and "Xun Chi Chang He Tu" (Ocarina and Panpipe Harmony Picture) made by Yu Zhiding for Wang Yuyang, which are also rare精品. The library has printed a small pamphlet called "Why Should Brick, Tile, and Books be Exhibited," and everyone who signs in at the meeting will receive a copy. The library's quarterly, "Haiyuan Pavilion Zhu Yuan Secret Book Catalogue," "The Present and Future of Haiyuan Pavilion's Collection," and brick and tile images are also sold temporarily. In the morning and afternoon, visitors came in an endless stream, and almost no space was available in the entire library. In total, on the first day, there were about tens of thousands of people. Also, the aforementioned book "Seal Imprints from the Ten Bell Studio and Ten Thousand Seal Building," with the printing plates kept by the Chen family in Weixian County, and the originals are also kept in the Chen family, totaling more than 7,000 ancient seals. In particular, the two seals Zhao Feiyan Seal and Huaiyang Wang Seal are珍寳世. It was previously rumored that the Chen family would sell them to Japanese merchants, asking for 130,000 yuan. The Japanese merchants offered 80,000 yuan, but the Chen family refused. It is now heard that the Japanese merchants are still living in Weixian County, willing to offer 110,000 yuan, intending to get them at all costs, but the deal has not yet been成交. A certain party has now sent a letter to the magistrate of Weixian County, asking him to pay attention to this matter, lest national treasures flow to foreign lands again. (21st)</p>
<h3>Investigation of Disaster Situation in Various Counties in Northern Anhui</h3>
<p>▲ Various Counties Have Formed Disaster Relief Associations</p>
<p>▲ Appealing to All Parties for Relief</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: The recent floods in northern Anhui have turned the area along the Huai River into a swamp. The disaster area covers more than 20 counties. People who have drowned or starved to death are happening all the time. Property losses are no less than several million. The voices of various counties calling for disaster relief are deafening. A few days ago, the Huai River water level showed a slight pause in rising, but there was no way to discharge it, and the recession was very slow. Unexpectedly, since the 19th, it has been raining again, non-stop. Therefore, the crops, trees, and houses are still mostly in the water. The disaster situation in each county is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Wuhe: Wuhe's terrain is low-lying. The Huai, Hui, Chong, Tong, and Tuo rivers surround the entire county, making it prone to floods. In recent years, it has suffered repeated poor harvests, and famines have been frequent. This summer, it was hoped that the two wheat crops would have a bumper harvest to alleviate the people's difficulties, but unexpectedly, they were flooded before they matured. After the water receded, the autumn crops were just planted when it rained continuously, and the Huai River flooded. The dikes and embankments were all breached, and a vast expanse of water turned into a swamp. Most of the people's houses collapsed, and they lived in the open air, barely eking out a living. The fields were filled with wailing, crying out for relief. The Wuhe branch of the World Red Swastika Society recently sent telegrams to various Red Swastika Society branches, appealing for the disaster victims.</p>
<p>▲ Fengyang: Fengyang borders the Huai River to the north and has flat terrain. The heavy rain caused the water depth on the flat ground to reach several feet. The autumn crops were completely submerged. Linhuai, due to its proximity to the Huai River and low-lying terrain, had a water depth of nearly ten feet in some places. More than 2,000 households of residents' houses were washed down by the rain. The local Red Swastika Society has also united with all circles to organize a flood emergency relief association to raise relief funds to help the disaster victims.</p>
<p>▲ Suxian: Suxian previously suffered a hailstorm, and the farmers suffered heavy losses. This time, there were four consecutive days of torrential rain, day and night. The water depth in the streets and markets was about a foot, and many houses collapsed. In the Xupoji area of the first district, the water depth on the flat ground was three feet, and boats could travel without obstruction. Moreover, the heavy rain in Yongcheng and Xiayi counties in eastern Henan also flowed into the Suxian border. Therefore, the low-lying areas in the northwest of the county have become a swamp. The autumn crops have been completely submerged. The district chiefs of each district in the county have separately investigated the disaster situation and reported it for relief.</p>
<p>▲ Mengcheng: Mengcheng is located in the Wo River basin, with the Fei River to the north and the Qian River to the south. The soil is fertile, making it the crown of the counties in northern Anhui. Since the beginning of summer, there has been continuous rain, and water has accumulated everywhere, forming ditches. During the recent heavy rain, which lasted for five days and nights, the Wo, Fei, and Qian rivers flooded at the same time, overflowing and mixing together. The water depth on the flat ground was five or six feet, drowning people and animals, and washing down houses, countless. The crops have been completely submerged, and the autumn harvest is almost hopeless. The people are crying out in pain, and the disaster situation is very serious.</p>
<p>▲ Shouxian: Shouxian has been suffering from continuous rain since the beginning of summer. Last month, when the Huai River water rose, the former county magistrate Zhang Xiangkun removed the moat dam outside the north gate of the city, causing the river water to overflow and flood the fields. Recently, there has been torrential rain and flash floods. Several sections of the north and south walls of the county were washed down by the rain, and the city and countryside were a vast expanse of water. Countless fields, houses, people, and livestock were swept away. Zhengyangguan in the southwest, due to its proximity to the confluence of the Huai and Pi rivers, had dangerous water conditions. The city and countryside were submerged in water, and the disaster situation was particularly tragic.</p>
<p>▲ Yingshang: Yingshang is located west of Shouxian, bordering the south bank of the Ying River and north of the Huai River. The terrain is low-lying, and there have been years of famine. The people's difficulties have not been alleviated. Since the beginning of summer, there has been heavy rain for many days, and flash floods have occurred. The Ying and Huai rivers have risen simultaneously, and the banks have collapsed and the embankments have breached, turning the entire county into a swamp. In Zhao Jiaji, Run Heji, Qiujiadi, Lingtai, and other places along the Huai River, more than 5,000 households of houses have been washed away, and countless people and livestock have been drowned. No less than 20,000 people have no homes to return to. The local Red Swastika Society believes that the disaster situation is severe and that relief is urgently needed. It has appealed to all parties for relief.</p>
<p>▲ Fuyang: Fuyang is the largest county in Anhui Province, and this time the flood was the largest and the disaster was the most severe. When the floodwaters rose sharply, there was torrential rain that did not stop for ten days. The water rose more than thirty feet, with towering waves, unprecedented. The Huai River water surface was hundreds of miles wide in some places, and the city walls were surrounded by water, in extreme danger. The entire territory was a vast expanse of water, with an estimated 50,000 households submerged and more than 2,000 people dead. Residents were scattered and half-submerged in water. Even those who climbed on the roofs of houses and trees had no way to survive and no way to appeal for help. Once they encountered wind and waves, they were swept into the water and became companions with the water gods. All circles in the county believe that the disaster situation is extremely tragic and that the refugees are crying out for food. A disaster relief association has been organized to raise relief funds and appeal to all parties to quickly allocate funds for disaster relief.</p>
<p>▲ Tianchang: Tianchang is located between the Yangtze and Huai rivers, bordering Jiangsu Province, and is the easternmost county in Anhui Province. It borders Gaoyou, Jieshou, and Bao Ying three lakes to the northeast, and the Baita River runs through it. The terrain is low-lying and prone to floods. There were major floods in 1916, 1921, and 1926. At the beginning of this month, there was heavy rain that lasted for several days and nights. The city and the countryside became a swamp. The new and old dike fields were all submerged. The white waves were滔滔, and the water and sky were the same色. The autumn crops in the fields were completely submerged in water, and countless residents' houses collapsed. The severity of the disaster is unprecedented since the beginning of the Republic. The county government has reported the disaster to the provincial government and requested relief.</p>
<p>▲ Xuyi: Xuyi is located in the lower reaches of the Huai River, bordering Hongze Lake to the north. The terrain is low-lying. The southeast is mountainous, and the terrain is relatively high. This time, there was continuous heavy rain, and the Huai River water level rose by thirty feet. The dikes and embankments were breached, and the riverbanks collapsed, resulting in a flood. In the Mingguang Zilaiqiao area in the southeast, flash floods broke out, and the water was even greater. The entire territory was a vast expanse of water, becoming a swamp. The people suffered heavy losses. The county authorities believed that the disaster situation was extremely severe and have telegraphed the province to report the disaster, requesting the allocation of funds for relief to save the survivors.</p>
<p>▲ Huaiyuan: Huaiyuan's terrain is low-lying, shaped like the bottom of a pot. This time, there was heavy rain for many days, flash floods broke out, and the rivers overflowed. The Huai River rose sharply by several dozen feet. The force of the water was unstoppable, causing the city and countryside to become a water kingdom. In addition, the hurricane blew and stirred up huge waves. The Huai Dike breached more than a hundred feet, and the water was滔天, flooding the wilderness, rushing downwards, and the momentum was extremely turbulent. Hundreds of miles of villages, houses, and livestock were almost completely submerged by the floods. Countless people drowned, and the surviving old, young, women, and children were displaced, gathering in the mountains, lying伏穷巖, moaning in the secluded valleys, having no place to栖片帍, and their kitchens were断烟. The Huaiyuan Flood Disaster Relief Association sent a letter to the Bengbu General Chamber of Commerce, appealing for the disaster victims. Sun Yuanfu and other standing committee members of the Chamber of Commerce, due to their hometown relationship, raised 200 bags of rice and transported them to Huaiyuan, which were handed over to the Relief Committee and the County Chamber of Commerce for distribution.</p>
<p>▲ Fengtai: Fengtai is located on the north bank of the Huai River and is the smallest and most impoverished county. This month, the continuous rain caused a disaster, and the water levels of the Huai and Fei rivers rose simultaneously. Many dikes and embankments were washed flat, and the entire territory was a vast expanse of water, becoming a swamp. Only the terrain in the west of the county was higher, and the water was slightly shallower. A person named Cao in the south of the county, seeing the flood rushing in, knew that there was no hope of escape. He tied his entire family of seven, men, women, old, and young, together with a long rope and went into the water to die together. The bodies floated to the Huai River and drifted downstream. A few days ago, they drifted to the river below this place, where they were finally fished out. It was also tragic. Within the disaster area, the crops were gone, and most of the villages were submerged in water. The autumn harvest was completely hopeless.</p>
<p>▲ Huoqiu: Huoqiu is located south of Yingshang, bordering the Huai River, and bordering Liuan and Gushi. The soil in the south of the county is fertile and has always been known as a rich area. In recent years, it has suffered from赤禍, and nine out of ten houses are empty. The north of the county is slightly low-lying due to its proximity to the Huai River. This time, the Huai River breached, and the water was very great. In addition, the East and West Lakes overflowed at the same time. Therefore, the northern border of the county has become a swamp. The crops and houses have been washed away, and countless people and livestock have been drowned. Disaster victims have come in groups to the east to flee the disaster, residing in the old Governor's Office and Guanyue Temple in Bengbu, totaling more than 500 people. The Huoqiu Compatriots Association in Bengbu has telegraphed the Central Disaster Relief Committee, requesting relief funds. The Disaster Relief Committee allocated 1,000 yuan, which was handed over to the Bengbu Public Security Bureau to collect and distribute on its behalf. After the Public Security Bureau received it, it distributed it separately in conjunction with the Huoqiu Compatriots Association Red Swastika Branch. (July 20th)</p>
<h3>After Deflan, the Murderer in the Wang Case in Dexian County, Was Escorted to Jinan</h3>
<p>▲ The US Consul Repeatedly Demanded Extradition</p>
<p>▲ The Provincial Government Telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for Instructions</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: In the case of Deflan, the deputy director of the Weishi Boji Hospital in Dexian County, shooting and killing the Chinese worker Wang Guoqing, the provincial government has telegraphed the Dexian County government, ordering Deflan to be escorted to Jinan yesterday (20th) and temporarily guarded by the Jinan Public Security Bureau. However, US Consul General Mihard has repeatedly demanded extradition. The provincial government, after the abolishment of the Foreign Affairs Office, according to the post-processing measures announced by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, was not convenient to advocate. On the same day, it telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for a detailed reply to base the handling. Today (21st) at about 4:00 PM, the US Consul again went to the provincial government to demand extradition. The provincial government replied that it had telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for instructions and that it could not be extradited temporarily before receiving a reply telegram. Currently, Deflan is in the No. 4 cell of the Jinan Public Security Bureau detention center. He is treated extremely well, and his daily life and diet are all sanitary, but he cannot move freely. The provincial government's telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is as follows: "Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Nanjing, with respect, secret, the case of Deflan, an American at the Boji Hospital in Dexian County, shooting and killing the Chinese worker Wang Guoqing, the deleted telegram should have been received. Later, because the public sentiment in the county was激昂, I was deeply afraid that the case would expand and accidents would occur. According to Article 11 of the Sino-US Treaty, I have ordered the collection of Deflan and escort to the province for transfer to the Jinan Municipal Government for temporary custody. The US Consul stationed in Jinan is currently demanding extradition, but it has not yet been transferred. In addition to the detailed sequel telegram, the matter concerns foreign affairs. According to the post-processing measures of the abolished Foreign Affairs Office of your ministry, the local government does not dare to preside over it. How should this case be handled? Please reply by telegram as soon as possible. Seal of the Shandong Provincial Government." (21st)</p>
<h3>Sun Hongzhe of the Jiangsu Construction Department Inspects the Water Situation in Jiangbei</h3>
<p>The water level of the canal in Jiangbei, Jiangsu Province, has risen, and it has only recently begun to stabilize slightly. However, it rained again yesterday and the day before, and the area along the canal is still in the period of rushing to protect it. Mao Yisheng, Director of the Water Conservancy Bureau, has arrived in Gaoyou to meet with Wu Tongju, Director of the Canal Construction Office. Director Wu returned to Zhenjiang from Gaoyou yesterday to report the situation of the flood to Sun Hongzhe of the Construction Department. According to reports, the canal water level has reached the堤, and the water outlets of the dams returning to the Yangtze River are a vast expanse of water. When will Director Mao return to the bureau? It depends on how the water situation develops in the future. The Construction Department is requesting the Finance Department to quickly allocate funds for the construction and prevention of disasters to meet urgent needs. At the same time, it plans to request the provincial government to send a special commissioner to supervise the construction. Director Sun has also decided to leave for Yangzhou by car across the river at 7:00 AM today (23rd), then take the new spring small wheel to inspect the water situation in the upper and lower reaches of the canal. In addition, according to the telegrams from various places to the Water Conservancy Bureau yesterday, the water level in Bengbu has dropped by 4 meters, with a stored water level of 19.79 meters. The water level in 灣 has increased by 4.6 centimeters, with a stored water level of 18.843 meters. The water level in Gouzha has increased by 4 inches, with a stored water level of 1 zhang and 8 chi and 5 cun. The water level in Gaoyou Yumatou has increased by 2 inches, with a stored water level of 1 zhang and 4 chi and 9 cun. This is due to the impact of the Huai River rising a few days ago. The water level in Bengbu has been falling repeatedly, and the phenomenon has improved slightly. Although the water level in 灣 has risen, the Liu Laojian Dam has been opened and can be discharged into the Liutang River to the sea as much as possible, which may not have much impact on the inner运.

It is said that the heads of each section will be changed.</p>
<p>The Farmers' Bank Admitted Trainees: The Suzhou Farmers' Bank recruited trainees on the 19th of this month. On that day, more than 190 people applied for the exam. After the written test, Yang Fengshu, the Deputy General Manager of the Head Office, and Sun Boyan, the Manager of the First District Branch, conducted oral examinations separately.

<h3>Kunshan</h3>
<p>The Garrisoned Soldiers in Kunshan Seized a Huge Amount of Opium: There are no less than dozens of well-known opium dealers in Kunshan. The organization meets at a certain tea house on Zhengyang Bridge. These people are very agile, making it impossible for the government to arrest them. The opium dealer Zhang Laowu, due to a dispute with a fellow dealer, reported to Hu Chengzhu, the squad leader of the Garrisoned Soldiers in Kunshan, and the soldier Sun Liren, saying that a certain train arriving in Kunshan had a large batch of opium unloaded. He requested an immediate arrest. Upon receiving the report, Hu went to wait beside Waiyangqi. When the train was about to arrive, he saw a large package of opium (300 taels) thrown from the train. A certain opium dealer stepped forward to pick it up. At that time, squad leader Hu ordered him to put it down and took the opium away. Afterwards, Zhang Laowu managed to recover the seized opium completely. The matter was learned by Battalion Commander Wen of the battalion. He immediately summoned squad leader Hu Chengzhu and soldier Sun Liren and arrested Zhang Laowu and the well-known opium dealer Run Zongren. After questioning, on the 23rd, he prepared a document to submit all the persons to the First Regiment Headquarters in Wuxi for disposal.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>The Hidden Reefs of the Cigarette Industry and Tobacco Shops: The county has added new urban areas and its population has increased year by year, and the cigarette industry has also developed accordingly. Originally, there was a cigarette paper industry association formed by cigarette paper dealers. Besides the incense cigarette companies stationed in Wuxi, all industries are now reorganizing into trade associations. The cigarette industry has also recently reorganized according to law. More than a dozen companies engaged in the wholesale of incense cigarettes, such as Da Mei, Zhou Yuansheng, Fu Taiyuan, Feng Taiyuan, and Tai Kang, initiated the reorganization to form the Cigarette Trade Association. However, there are a total of six or seven hundred tobacco shops, large and small, in the city. Previously, they all belonged to one association, but now they have been abandoned by the major firms and are resentful. They are also secretly initiating the organization of a tobacco shop trade association. The name is compliant and does not violate laws and regulations. The major firms learned of this and immediately tried to win over some tobacco shops to join their association in order to divide the organization. However, the number of tobacco shops is still not small, and they are now actively organizing according to the precedents in Shanghai and other places, and will soon be able to announce their establishment.</p>
<p>Continuous Rainstorms and Expanding Disaster: After two heavy rains this month, the river water in the county rose sharply, and low-lying fields have become a watery world. Fortunately, the river water gradually receded, and the disaster did not expand. Who knew that on the night of the twenty-second, the weather was unusually cool, the thermometer reached seventy-two degrees, the heavy rain continued, and the river water suddenly rose. The water volume has exceeded the highest level of the previous time, and even slightly higher low-lying fields are in imminent danger. The disaster is expanding and cannot be contained. Houses in low-lying areas in urban and rural areas have been submerged in water, and many have collapsed. Fields, gardens, and vegetables have been submerged in water, and prices are surprisingly high. There are no vegetables to be found in the low-lying areas.</p>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce's Position on Anti-Japanese Aid to Overseas Chinese: All Chinese people are deeply indignant about the Korean Wanbaoshan case. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce has initiated the organization of an All-Circles Anti-Japanese Aid to Overseas Chinese Committee, and has resolved four measures. The Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce has also telegraphed the central government to clearly define its diplomatic policy in order to concentrate efforts, and advised all industries related to Japanese goods to pay attention to the measures set by Shanghai and wait for the county party headquarters to lead the handling. Furthermore, since the central government is now actively suppressing the communists, and there have been many rumors in the north recently that the Japanese are using traitors to engage in sabotage, as evidenced by the Wanbaoshan case, which is a customary trick, there are many deep concerns in our country. Within the scope of not harming the country's economy and not hindering social public order, we should follow the central government's leadership and actively participate. As for Japanese goods in the interior of Jiangsu Province, they are all imported from Shanghai. If Shanghai can investigate, detain, and completely eliminate them, there will be no problem in the interior. Yesterday, a special telegram was sent to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce to lead and actively proceed to prevent Japanese goods from being transported in, which would protect the commerce in the interior. At the same time, separate telegrams were sent to the Central National Government, the Jiangsu Provincial Party Department, and the Provincial Government to request instructions on policy for consistency. On the one hand, various industries were also encouraged to actively raise funds and remit them to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce for transfer to aid overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>The Rising Water Level at Lujiangkou and Defense: The 14th Branch of the Public Security Bureau, considering that Lujiangkou in its jurisdiction is an important route to enter the lake, previously consulted with the 17th District Office and resolved to set up water gates at the entrance of the river to prohibit ships from traveling to prevent lake bandits from infiltrating. Who knew that recently, due to continuous heavy rains, the lake water rose sharply, the wooden piles sank, and were entangled by aquatic plants, blocking the water flow, resulting in the submergence of more than a thousand acres of rice seedlings nearby. After discussion, it was decided to remove the wooden piles, but once removed, the defense would inevitably be empty. Yesterday, a special report was submitted to the Public Security Bureau for forwarding to County Chief Chen, requesting the dispatch of four patrol boats to be stationed permanently, so that water conservancy and defense can be taken care of at the same time, and banditry can be prevented.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Liu Hongzhao Handed Over Public Funds in Full During His Term: Liu Hongzhao, the former director of the Finance Bureau of the county, rushed to complete the handover immediately after leaving office. Yesterday, he specially invited party and government agencies and local gentry to conduct a public review. In addition to the fact that special funds had been fully allocated, not only was there no hidden deposit under the provincial tax items, but also seven thousand yuan of loans had been cleared.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Another Rural Case in Gaozi Township, West of the County: Gaozi Township in the west of the county has been plagued by bandits year after year, with looting, extortion, arson, and killings, and there has been no peace. Fortunately, the 4th Battalion of the 3rd Infantry Regiment of the Security Force searched and suppressed the bandits in the town for several months, and the bandits began to disappear. Now, because they are stationed in Xiashu, the bandits have become rampant again. The other night, dozens of bandits suddenly took away Xiao Bangkui and Xiao Longfu in Xiaojiazhuang. Yesterday, one person was taken away in Zhuke Village in the mountains. Now the head of the Second District, Tong Jiasheng, has sent people to investigate and telegraphed the county government on his behalf to forward the report to the Security Office, requesting the dispatch of a team to station there as soon as possible to deter the bandits.</p>
<p>Speculative Merchants Import Japanese Goods on a Large Scale: Since the Wanbaoshan massacre occurred, people everywhere have been indignant. Zhenjiang, as an important trading port in Jiangbei, has seen that the Zhenjiang Party Department has organized a Support Association for Anti-Japanese Aid to Overseas Chinese and will implement a boycott of Japanese goods. General unscrupulous merchants are now seeing that the Zhenjiang Party Department has organized the Anti-Japanese Aid to Overseas Chinese Support Association and will implement a boycott of Japanese goods. They are deeply afraid of affecting their business, so recently, sugar merchants in the Yaoyiguan area have been particularly panicked, with cars and porters transporting goods all day long. Even if they don't have time to unload goods during the day, they continue to do so at night. Even though it has been raining these past few days, they have not stopped. Other industries have also purchased goods in large quantities.</p>
<p>Yao Mingrang Released on Bail: Yao Mingrang, the former director of the Jingjiang Construction Bureau, was dismissed for embezzling public funds, and the Construction Department investigated and handed him over to the Zhenjiang Court for investigation. He was taken into custody. After being detained, Yao filed a petition for bail, which was approved. Yesterday, he was notified to present one thousand yuan of public bonds to offset three thousand yuan of bail to the court, and was immediately released to await summons.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Huang Yunxuan Throws Himself into the Net Again: Huang Yunxuan of Xiaoliufang Lane in this city, two months ago, represented his relative Tang Lin and Chen Hongfu in filing a complaint with the Superintendent's Office due to a real estate dispute. He was rejected and ignored. Later, Chen accused Huang of impersonating a military officer of the Superintendent's Office to extort money. The Superintendent's Office summoned Huang and Chen for interrogation, and it was found that Huang Yunxuan was not suspected of impersonating a military officer, and Chen Hongfu was making a false accusation out of malice. Huang was released, and an official document was prepared to transfer Chen to the Procuratorate of the Jiangdu County Court for custody, investigation, and handling. After repeated investigations and inquiries by the Procuratorate, the investigation was concluded and a decision was made not to prosecute, and Chen was released. However, Huang Yunxuan was still unwilling and accused Chen at the Superintendent's Office, believing that the allegations were contradictory and abnormal. The Superintendent's Office again took Huang into custody at the Public Security Bureau to await investigation.</p>
<p>Prison Warden Arrested for Smoking Opium: Cao Yukun, a prison warden in Jiangdu County, was accused of smoking opium and reported to the High Court, which secretly ordered the Jiangdu County Court to conduct a thorough investigation and report back. It is reported that after receiving the order, the court sent personnel to investigate the prison warden and confirmed that he had a habit. This morning (22nd) at 7:00 a.m., Judge Huang Zhe and Clerk Yin Yongxi were dispatched to search for evidence in the prison warden's bedroom, and they found smoking paraphernalia and opium dregs. Judge Huang immediately brought the prison warden and the paraphernalia to the court for interrogation. The warden admitted to smoking opium. President Chen believed that the prison warden was under the jurisdiction of the county government, so he transferred him to the county government for custody. At the same time, the court reported to the High Court for instructions on how to handle the case.</p>
<p>Continued Investigation of the Qianjiashan Massacre: It is reported that in the case of burying people alive in Qianjiashan, in the west of the county, the murderer Qian Sanxi's son Xue Youfu and Da Hualian, because the authorities had news of the investigation, secretly dug out the body from the pit in the middle of the night, put it in a coffin, and gathered the villagers nearby to sign a circular document, aiming to eliminate the distinction between principal offenders and accomplices, falsely claiming public opinion, and many mourned the innocent dead and refused to sign. The outcome is unknown.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Remedies for Local Financial Difficulties: The local finances of Nantong have recently been extremely strained.</p>
<p>The Property Office issued 30,000 yuan of temporary loan certificates and borrowed 35,000 yuan from industrial and financial circles to pay for accumulated political, police, and self-government expenses. The county government stated that the county's provincial tax revenue is 100,000 yuan per year, but the advances often exceed more than double that amount, so it submitted a report to the provincial government for forwarding to the department, requesting that notifications be issued within the scope of provincial tax revenue. Furthermore, considering that the supplementary tax on salt land differs greatly from that on civilian land, it was decided to convene a meeting of salt land field managers, district chiefs, and representatives of various agencies on August 2 to discuss the average burden method for civilians and salt workers.</p>
<p>Education Bureau Takes Over All Confucius Temples in the County: The Education Bureau, upon receiving instructions from the department, will jointly with the county take over the Confucius temples in various districts of the county, as well as all assets and equipment, to expand education.</p>
<p>Jiangbei Automobile Industry Opposes Revising New Regulations: The automobile industry in various counties in Jiangbei opposed the revision of the new automobile donation regulations by the Construction Department and went on strike to oppose the donation. The Nantong Construction Bureau has telegraphed the department to postpone the implementation.</p>
<h3>Rugao</h3>
<p>The Trend of Draining Water from Juegang is Increasing Day by Day: The tail end of the Jianxiaoshuai Changhe River in Juegang City of this county, which is also the junction point of the upper end of the public river, is separated by an earth dam with a water hole, called the Dragon King Cave. The drainage of the waterway outside the dam all depends on this cave. However, due to the terrain, the water from Chenjiayuan and various ponds in the northwest exits from this cave, and the effect is very weak. Recently, heavy rains have caused disasters, and the rice fields have been flooded, so the earth dam was opened to connect with the salt land public river to facilitate drainage and allow the water to enter the sea. However, because the salt residents outside the dam have low-lying terrain, the rice seedlings have been submerged. The route for drainage has been obstructed by the dikes built by various salt reclamation companies, and it is about to become a watery world. If the water from the dikes is poured in again, it will be like adding fuel to the fire, which is unthinkable. Therefore, the salt residents of the sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth districts went to the district office and various agencies on the 15th to petition, demanding to build up the earth dam, but there was no result. The salt residents then automatically built it up. On the 16th, the farmers from the dike farmland gathered more than a hundred people and opened the dam again. Who knew that while they were working, the salt farmers gathered three or four hundred people with gongs and drums, each carrying agricultural implements. The farmers from the dike farmland saw the situation was not good and fled. The dam was still blocked by the salt residents. Farmers from both the farmland and salt land have disputes over water drainage due to their respective interests, as described above. The drainage of water from the salt land is almost entirely controlled by the Da Yu Company and various warehouses, disregarding the lives of the Lao圩 farmers. Previously, because the gates and dams were closed, many tenant farmers were beaten and injured. On the 16th, the village chiefs and deputy chiefs of various salt land villages invited people from all walks of life to hold a meeting in Zhongshan Hall to discuss solutions. They unanimously resolved to submit a petition to the county government to quickly investigate the situation and provide relief, open the Lujia River, and order the companies to open various dams and gates to facilitate drainage, and to punish the murderers of the dead and injured. While the meeting was in progress, farmers from both the farmland and salt land came to petition. The resolved solutions were announced to the public, and then they dispersed. The merchants and residents of the city also believed that the Da Yu Company prohibited the salt residents from draining water and arbitrarily beat and killed people, so they went on strike from the 16th to support them, and the market has not yet opened until today (20th). The outcome of this matter is unknown.</p>

<p>Two嵊 County Bandits Executed by Firing Squad: The notorious bandit Liu Baocheng (alias Dong Qianjia Die) from 嵊 County repeatedly colluded with bandits such as Zhang Hanquan and Zhang Shiming, using guns to kidnap Jin Baixiang and others and demanding ransom, committing many crimes. Zhang Chunhe, the captain of the 10th team of the county's militia patrol, led his team to suppress the bandits in the Xiangnan District and captured the notorious bandit at the foot of Badouguling. In addition, the 嵊 County bandit Yao Linlao had repeatedly kidnapped five or six "Gods of Wealth."

Both confessed during interrogation and were sentenced to death. The sentences have been submitted to the provincial government for approval and were executed by firing squad immediately.</p>
<p>Murderer's Appeal Rejected, Death Sentence Upheld: You Mingzhai, a 24-year-old farmer from Linhai, was previously accused of committing a serious murder case in his hometown. After a trial by the local court, the facts of the case were clarified and he was sentenced to death. You filed an appeal and was sent to Hangzhou in January and detained in the High Court's detention center. After several trials, the case has been concluded. Yesterday, the First Criminal Division of the High Court announced its verdict, upholding the original sentence and ordering him to be sent back to his hometown in Linhai for execution.</p>

<h3>Mingguang</h3>
<p>The Tragic Situation of Flooding in Various Counties in Eastern Anhui: There has been torrential rain in eastern Anhui for the entire month, and rivers have overflowed, causing a major disaster. The disaster situation in various counties is recorded below. The eastern border of Dingyuan is the source of the Chi River. On the 5th of this month, there was torrential rain. On the 6th, the torrents from the Wanghuigang mountains rushed down, and the water level was as high as ten feet. As a result, the entire Chi River bank became a watery world, and the towns of Daiqiao, Outang, Renhe, and Sanhe were all several feet deep in water. Countless villages were submerged, and more than a thousand people died. It was truly a catastrophe. The northwest township of Lingbi, which borders the Chi River, was also severely affected. All the most productive agricultural areas of Hongmiao, Jiaocheng, Chendui, Qili, and Jiansi, etc., were submerged, and there is no hope for the autumn harvest. Wuhe is the confluence of several rivers. This time, all the rivers overflowed, and the torrents from Sanhejian, Zhengyangguan, and other places rushed straight down. On the 7th, dozens of sections of the western embankment of the Huai River collapsed, and the water level is now more than ten feet above the embankment. The entire county has suffered a major flood. Except for a section of North Main Street, the entire town is a vast expanse of water. The extent of the disaster can be imagined. Fearing that the roadbed would be destroyed by the water, the railway authorities transported a large amount of gravel on the 19th to reinforce the roadbed. The small ferries of Wudang and Wuling suspended operations one after another due to the excessive water level. The floodwaters in Mingguang have receded very slowly, and the disaster area is still a vast expanse of water. The victims are scattered in the Houshantou area, exposed to the wind and dew, and their situation is extremely tragic. Recently, there have been continuous heavy rains, and the water has risen again. Alas, the people of this place have nowhere to die.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Orders That Normal School Students Must Serve for One Year Before Being Allowed to Enter University</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education has issued an order to the education departments of various provinces and cities, national universities, and vocational schools that graduates of high school normal departments who have received free treatment must serve for one year before being allowed to enter university. It is stated that the method for normal school graduates of senior high schools to enter university has been instructed by the Ministry to National Zhejiang University and published in the Gazette. The high school normal department was originally established to train primary school teachers or other personnel serving in the education field. Students receive free treatment during their studies and should have service obligations after graduation. These students should be slightly restricted from applying to vocational schools and above. Therefore, the previous order is reiterated to clearly stipulate that all graduates mentioned above, whether they are exempted from all or part of their tuition, food, lodging fees, must have proof of service in the education field for more than one year before they can apply to public or registered private vocational schools and above. In addition to distributing the instructions, this order is hereby issued to the department for forwarding to the provincial and registered private vocational schools and above for compliance, and to instruct all public senior high schools to be informed of this order.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education's Instructions on University Admission for Rural Teachers</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education also received a report from Huang Jiabai stating that since the level of students graduating from rural teacher special programs is equivalent to that of those who have completed the second grade of senior high school normal departments, can they be inserted into the third grade of senior high school according to the old system of university admission for normal school graduates? Are there any restrictions on the departments they can enter? The Ministry of Education instructed that since the graduation level of rural teacher special programs is equivalent to the second grade of senior high school normal departments, those who wish to continue their studies can be handled according to the old system of senior high school enrollment for normal school graduates stipulated in the Ministry's Instruction No. 976 of the previous year, but they must be limited to applying for senior high school normal departments or normal schools. The admission standards should still be subject to the strict examination of the school in order to ensure the connection of levels. Please be informed accordingly.</p>
<h3>Investigator Xu of the Jiangsu Education Department Destroys Education in Songjiang: An Appeal</h3>
<p>To the Fellow Villagers of Songjiang in Shanghai:</p>
<p>We, Xu Pengzu and 575 other teachers and staff of primary and secondary schools in Songjiang, respectfully address you, esteemed gentlemen of Songjiang residing in Shanghai. The education budget for Songjiang, since the 17th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1928], has been allocated according to the minimum standards stipulated by Zhongshan University. By the 19th year [1930] budget, it had already been drastically reduced by the Education Department, causing actual difficulties. However, due to strict official decrees, we have endured the hardship until now. With the 20th year [1931] budget, it was further reduced by the Education Department. School administrators were already deeply concerned. Unexpectedly, Xu Xihuang, a staff member from the Education Department, came to Songjiang for investigation and suddenly drastically reduced the already approved 20th-year budget, amounting to over 37,000 yuan, reaching three-tenths of the total education expenses of the entire county. Furthermore, based on his personal negative views, he ordered the closure of more than 30 schools. Such destruction of education and mistreatment of teachers is a clear violation of the late Premier's exhortation to revitalize education and disregards the National Assembly's motion to improve treatment. Such retrograde actions have gone too far. Upon investigation, Songjiang education funds have savings and have never been in deficit. Even the newly added land tax has been kept untouched, as instructed. However, Investigator Xu acted according to his own whims, falsely reporting to the Education Department and forcing schools to stop operating, like "abandoning eating for fear of choking" and "cutting the feet to fit the shoes." The sudden shock has left us in a state of panic and bewilderment. In addition to sending telegrams to the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Ministry of Education, the Provincial Party Headquarters, and the Provincial Government requesting correction, we also earnestly implore you, gentlemen, to provide assistance in your esteemed newspaper to safeguard the education of our hometown and benefit its progress. We would be immensely grateful.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Xu Pengzu, Wang Chengxun, Chen Guisan, Shen Fusun, Zhu Zhu, and 575 other teachers and staff of primary and secondary schools in Songjiang County.</p>
<p>Attached: Facts of the Matter</p>
<p>Upon investigation, although Songjiang's education budget is not affluent, it is sufficient to maintain operations. Since the 17th year, school expenses have been allocated according to the minimum standards stipulated by Zhongshan University, leaving no cause for concern about inadequacy. Therefore, in past years, there have been no unfortunate incidents such as arrears in school expenses or unpaid salaries for teachers and staff. The Education Bureau's budget submissions have not indicated any shortfall or requested guidance on solutions. This proves that Songjiang's education funds can maintain the current state. Why should it be exhausted or bankrupted? However, Xu Xihuang, the investigator appointed by the Education Department, hastily conducted a brief inquiry, disregarding the truth, and abruptly claimed that this year's budget required a deficit of 111,000 yuan. If Investigator Xu's words are true, why didn't the Education Bureau consider this when submitting the 20th-year budget? Why did the Education Department approve it after review? It is clearly evident that Investigator Xu's investigation was negligent and did not align with the facts. The resulting impact is that primary and secondary schools are unable to maintain operations due to arbitrary budget cuts, causing a sudden drastic change to the stable educational state in Songjiang. Can it be said that Investigator Xu did not intend to destroy it? Our late Premier's views on revitalizing and expanding education are found in his doctrines and speeches. Yet Investigator Xu is destroying and undermining it. How can such words and actions come from an educational administrator under the Three Principles of the People? Furthermore, the inaccuracies in Investigator Xu's report and plan are self-evident. For example, when reducing primary and secondary school expenses, he merely stated a certain amount was reduced in general terms, without specifying which item was reduced by how much. This shows that he did not carefully examine the facts and based it solely on speculation. Such important education expenses can be arbitrarily allocated, revealing the extent of the errors. According to the 17th-year budget for primary school senior grades, with four classrooms in the senior level, the annual amount was 5,496 yuan. In the 19th-year budget, with four classrooms in the senior level, the annual amount was 4,476 yuan for Category A and 4,224 yuan for Category B, a reduction of 1,020 yuan to 1,272 yuan. The submitted and approved 20th-year budget allocated 4,140 yuan for Category A and 3,912 yuan for Category B for four classrooms in the senior level, a decrease of 336 yuan and 312 yuan compared to the 19th year, and a decrease of 1,356 yuan to 1,584 yuan compared to the 17th year. The junior levels were also reduced accordingly. Recently, the Department issued an order to suddenly change the already approved 20th-year budget. According to Investigator Xu's plan, each senior level grade would be reduced by another 400 yuan, leaving only 700 yuan. After paying teacher salaries, there would be nothing left for other staff salaries and miscellaneous expenses. It is incomprehensible what standards Investigator Xu used to determine this plan. Primary school tuition revenue is extremely low, even to the point of being non-existent, and books and supplies must be provided free of charge. Now, Investigator Xu calculates that each classroom in urban areas should have 40 students, and rural areas should have 80% of that amount, which is difficult to achieve in reality. In addition, each grade has its recurring expenses reduced by 40 yuan. Whether it can be maintained or not is obvious to those who are perceptive. Our Songjiang secondary schools only have the Provincial Middle School, County Middle School, County Normal School, and County Women's Normal School. The Provincial Middle School also admits out-of-province students. The County Normal School will only recruit junior high school graduates from now on, and the Women's Normal School does not recruit public classes every year. However, the number of elementary school senior level graduates in the current year is over 400, and it is already difficult to accommodate all of them. Yet, Investigator Xu only knows how to save money and does not allow the County Middle School to establish double tracks in the first year, as per the existing plan, but only allows the recruitment of 50 new students. He also does not allow the County Normal School to recruit first-year students, intending to make so many eager students lose their opportunity to study. The intention behind this is difficult to understand. The County Middle School has over 50 students in the second year. According to the regulations, it should be allowed to establish double classes. During Investigator Xu's investigation, the actual attendance was 54 students. However, Investigator Xu incorrectly stated that the actual attendance was only 49 students, and that the 20th year should be combined into one classroom. This is a significant oversight. The County Middle School originally had two instructors, as it was more convenient and effective to train male and female students separately. However, Investigator Xu did not understand this point and planned to cut one person. Examining the facts, there is no agreement on the top. Although the County Normal School's school buildings are not spacious, adding a grade is more than sufficient. Although the facilities are not perfect, they are gradually being improved each year. For the sake of implementing teacher training and providing students with a path, it is best to recruit elementary school graduates. However, Investigator Xu insisted on recruiting junior high school graduates, disregarding teacher training and local needs to such an extent. The Women's Normal School, due to limited funding, only pays half the salaries of other secondary schools, paying 50 cents per hour. Therefore, many hired teachers have to take on multiple roles. However, the Women's Normal School, with its limited funding, has established private classes in addition to public classes to remedy the shortage of teachers. Graduates from previous classes who serve in schools have achieved excellent results. However, Investigator Xu only saw that there were fewer full-time teachers and immediately made harsh accusations. It is unlikely that someone with a clear mind would do this. Investigator Xu said that Songjiang is close to Shanghai, but the salaries of teachers and staff are lower than in Shanghai. Therefore, those with better qualifications and more experience flock to Shanghai. This is indeed the reality. With such large-scale budget cuts, the salaries of teachers will certainly be further reduced. Is this not a signal to those seeking improvements to leave quickly? Investigator Xu said that many collection agencies in Songjiang are behind on tax collections, such as having funds from one year being settled two or three years later, causing the revenues and expenditures of education funds to be mismatched. However, it is not known that although the funds from Year C are collected in Years D and E, the funds from Years A and B can be collected in Year C. The funds from Years A and B are used to offset the deficit of Year C, and so on, so there is no shortage. It is only cleared one year at a time.</p>
<p>It only seems like there is a deficit. Investigator Xu said that there is a lot of waste in the school expenses, and they must be greatly reduced. However, the salaries paid to teachers and combatants in each school are in accordance with the regulations, and other expenses are supported by vouchers. Moreover, recurring revenues and expenditures are listed monthly and sent to the Economic Audit Committee for auditing. Even the annual budget was approved by the order. What does the so-called waste mean? In short, Investigator Xu disregarded the facts and arbitrarily reduced the expenses of primary and secondary schools. His statements are often unfair. Whether he had preconceived notions before the investigation, or whether he was not careful during the investigation, we dare not rashly conclude. However, the investigation is untrue, obscuring the authorities, and the plan is inappropriate, affecting education. The blame for dereliction of duty cannot be shirked. Strictly speaking, using a report to destroy the education of primary and secondary schools in our Songjiang and put it in a desperate situation is a major responsibility. Since Investigator Xu said that the reason for the deficit in Songjiang's education expenses lies in the clerks and so on manipulating the funds, the solution should be designed from the tax collection side. However, he did not think about the root cause and only reduced the expenses of the schools. If the clerks manipulate the funds and the education expenses are completely cut off, will Investigator Xu also advocate that our schools in Songjiang be completely closed? How can such retrograde actions go so far? For the sake of the future of education in Songjiang, Pengzu and others convened a joint meeting of primary and secondary school teachers and staff on the 14th of this month to discuss this matter. Everyone agreed to send telegrams to various agencies requesting correction, maintain the original budget of the 17th year, avoid reductions, and maintain education and promote progress.</p>

<h3>Huizhong Middle School, a Church School, Proceeds with Registration</h3>
<p>▲ Western Principal Crawford Resigns… Zhang Dongmin Succeeds</p>
<p>Huizhong Middle School, located at Ximen Xieqiao in this city, has been run by the American Seventh-day Baptist Mission for over 40 years. It has long been known for its reputation in the Christian education community in East China. In the past two or three years, in order to adapt to the new trends, the school has held many meetings to discuss the issue of school registration and seek to proceed with it. However, it was ultimately unable to become a reality because it did not obtain the approval of the American Mission. Until mid-May of this year, after the school's entire faculty and staff finally requested the American Mission, it agreed. Therefore, in the past two months, the school has been proceeding with registration matters. It is now reported that the board of directors has been established and invited thirteen people, including Liu Zhanen, Liao Shicheng, Rong Qizhao, Wang Xinzhai, Zhu Kaichou, Pei Dike, and Sun Henian, to serve as directors. The original Western principal, Mr. Crawford, has also voluntarily resigned, and Zhang Dongmin, Director of the Biology Department of Guanghua University, has been appointed as the new principal. It is also reported that the school's operating policy in the future, in addition to maintaining the original principle of emphasizing quality over quantity, will appropriately balance the number of students due to the completion of the new school building, and add a business department in the senior high school.</p>
<h3>Preparation for Modern Middle School</h3>
<p>People in Shanghai who are enthusiastic about education have initiated the establishment of a Modern Middle School and have invited Yi Peiji and Fan Xianyun to be directors. All preparations have been completed, and an application has been submitted to the Municipal Education Bureau for approval and filing. Enrollment information will be published in the newspaper soon.</p>

<h3>New York Heavyweight Boxing Championship: Wagner and Xia Gai Tie</h3>
<p>丨The result of fifteen rounds of hard work丨</p>
<p>New York, 22nd telegram The local boxing association, after expressing its dissent regarding the German Schmering holding onto the heavyweight boxing championship this year, started anew and held a match between Mai Gai Wagner and Jack Xia Gai on the evening of July 22 at the Aibola Arena in Broukelun. There were 25,000 enthusiastic spectators participating in this scene of a dragon and tiger fight. Fifteen rounds went by, and the two were equally matched, resulting in a tie.</p>
<p>▲ The entry of the two heroes shook the earth.</p>
<p>丨Xia Gai weighed 29 pounds more丨</p>
<p>▲ Wagner makes a comeback Wagner, the world middleweight boxing champion, had won every battle before his retirement, maintaining his reputation undefeated. When he declared his leap into the heavyweight boxing stage, boxing experts generally gave him good sympathy. As reported in yesterday's newspaper, McOlifu, the retired lightweight champion, even promised him to be a future championship winner. His popularity can be seen. His weight is 169 and a half pounds.</p>
<p>▲ Xia Gai is full of heroism Jack Xia Gai, when he competed with Schmering for hegemony last year, was on a roll, but was judged to have failed due to a foul. Commentators regretted it. Afterwards, Xia Gai was unwilling to accept and requested a rematch. Xue refused. The New York Committee then reversed and recognized Xia Gai as the champion. His weight is 198 and a half pounds, which is 29 pounds heavier than Wagner, which is quite an advantage. When the two heroes entered the arena with tiger-like steps, they were greeted by enthusiastic cheers from the crowd, shaking the earth. It was a grand event for a time.</p>
<p>▲ Fifteen rounds of competition: crowned kings side by side</p>
<p>丨Most of the audience at the arena praised Wagner丨</p>
<p>▲ Xia Gai launches a strong attack At the beginning of the match, Xia Gai was cautious and repeatedly forced Wagner to the side of the rope. His left and right hands kept circling and advancing. Wagner's defense was thorough, and he was spared injury. In the first and second rounds, Xia Gai launched a strong attack and gained the upper hand.</p>
<p>▲ Wagner gradually gains the upper hand In the third and fourth rounds, Xia Gai was defeated. In the fourth round, Xia Gai tried hard to trap Wagner in a dead end, placing both fists horizontally in front of his chest and exposing his face completely to lure the enemy to attack, and then taking the opportunity to attack. However, Wagner advanced and retreated well, and did not fall into the enemy's trap. Although Wagner repeatedly won in these two rounds, he only had a slight advantage.</p>
<p>▲ Xia Gai injures the enemy and benefits From the fifth round, Xia Gai struck fiercely, and Wagner fell to the ground, but he immediately jumped up without any injury. Soon after, Wagner's eye was injured, and he lost the fifth, sixth, and seventh rounds as a result. The eighth round was a tie because Xia Gai was ultimately unable to break through Wagner's defense.</p>
<p>▲ Wagner strives to be promising In the ninth round, the two men fought wildly against each other. Then, Wagner repeatedly hit the enemy's stomach, causing Xia Gai to sway. Wagner won this round. In the next tenth round, there was no distinction between the two.</p>
<p>▲ The situation is unpredictable In the eleventh round, Wagner continued to take the offensive. Xia Gai was hit and swayed as if drunk. Wagner took the upper hand again. In the twelfth round, Xia Gai punched the enemy in the face, and Wagner's face was covered in blood. Thanks to his effective defense, although he lost this round, the overall situation was not affected.</p>
<p>▲ The two divide the honors equally In the fourteenth round, Xia Gai always thought of knocking down the enemy with one blow, but the enemy was good at defending. In the fifteenth round, the three worked even harder, but one was hard and one was soft, one was clumsy and one was skillful, and the two rounds ended in a tie. It was difficult to judge who was strong and who was weak.</p>
<p>▲ The crowd praises Wagner Wagner performed his lifelong best, not giving Xia Gai any slight advantage. Therefore, he was greatly praised by the crowd. Xia Gai seemed surprised by this challenger. After the three referees voted, Daonawan nominated Wagner, one nominated Xia Gai, and the third cast a peaceful vote. The battle closed, and the two were declared crowned kings side by side.</p>

<h3>Song Ziwen's Encounter with Danger at the North Station Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>▲ Assailants and Guards Exchange Fire</p>
<p>▲ Minister Song Escapes Danger with Alertness</p>
<p>▲ Secretary Tang Yuluo Tragically Dies</p>
<p>▲ One Guard and Ten Passengers Injured</p>
<p>▲ Assailants Flee, One Suspect Apprehended</p>
<p>Finance Minister Song Ziwen, accompanied by his confidential secretary Tang Yuluo and six guards, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning at 7:00 AM from Nanjing on the overnight express train. After Song and his party alighted from the train and walked out of the platform into the station hall, passing the information desk and reaching the waiting room entrance, a group of assailants suddenly appeared. They pulled out hand grenades, Mauser pistols, and handguns and launched a fierce attack on Song. Song's guards also drew their guns and returned fire. Bullets flew in all directions, and smoke filled the air. The North Station hall was instantly transformed into a battlefield. At the time, passengers were crowding to exit the station and scattered in panic at the sound of gunfire, throwing everything into chaos. As a result, Mr. Song was fortunate to escape unharmed, but Secretary Tang Yuluo sustained three gunshot wounds and died from his injuries at 11:30 AM yesterday. One of Song's guards sustained minor injuries, and ten other passengers were wounded by stray bullets, including Wang Shiduo, a secretary of the Control Yuan with the rank of senior appointee. The details obtained by our newspaper reporter from the investigation are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Column at the North Station Hall Marked with Bullet Holes (Photo by This Newspaper)</h3>
<p>Song and Tang Walked Side by Side: The Nanjing-Shanghai overnight train is scheduled to arrive at the North Station at 6:53 AM. Yesterday morning, the train arrived at 7:08 AM, a delay of fifteen minutes. Mr. Song was riding in the private car at the rear of the train. After getting off, he emerged from the platform in the crowd. At the time, Inspector Zhao Xinzhong, dispatched by the station police department, was leading the way with two officers. Mr. Song was wearing a Western-style suit, an overcoat, and a white foreign cloth helmet. He walked side by side with Secretary Tang. Tang was wearing a summer cloth long gown and carrying a large black leather bag. Behind Song and Tang were Song's six guards.</p>
<h3>Portrait of Mr. Tang Yuluo</h3>
<p>▲ Assailants Lay in Ambush: As Song and his party walked past the station information desk at the east entrance of the hall and advanced a few more steps, about seven or eight assailants, who had concealed themselves by the large cement columns, suddenly pulled out their guns and fired at Song. Several loud bangs rang out, and the scene instantly changed. The time was 7:12 AM. Song's guards quickly drew their guns and returned fire. The assailants then threw hand grenades, creating bright flashes and dense smoke. Mr. Song, with his quick wits, quickly threw away his white hat and also ducked behind a large column. The guards surrounded and protected him from the front and rear, but Secretary Tang became the target of the attack and instantly fell to the ground, wounded. At the same time, Song was escorted by railway police to the traffic office and rested in the office of the two bureau chiefs on the second floor. Meanwhile, the remaining guards continued to engage in a fierce battle with the assailants. The two sides fired no less than a hundred bullets. After about five minutes, the assailants, not daring to linger, hastily abandoned their weapons and escaped into the crowd of passengers, disappearing without a trace.</p>
<p>▲ Tang Sent to Hospital: After the assailants fled and the gunfire gradually subsided, the injured Secretary Tang was quickly helped into Mr. Song's car by the guards and taken to Baolong Hospital for treatment. They arrived at the hospital at 7:25 AM. At the same time, Minister Song, in the bureau chief's office, urgently notified the Garrison Headquarters by telephone, requesting that troops be dispatched to provide protection. At 7:40 AM, Song himself, accompanied by his guards, returned to his residence in his own car that had come back from Baolong Hospital, to rest. Among Song's party, besides Tang, who sustained three gunshot wounds, and one guard, Min Ziqing, whose left leg was hit by shrapnel from a hand grenade, the rest were unharmed, which was indeed fortunate.</p>
<p>▲ Severe Bladder Injury: The guard Min Ziqing, 32 years old, from Hubei, was injured in the right leg by shrapnel and immediately collapsed to the ground, unable to stand. After Song and his party returned to their residence, a car was hired by the railway police to first take Min to his residence in Zhabei. At around 9:00 AM, he was also sent to Baolong Hospital for treatment. After Secretary Tang arrived at the hospital, his family members rushed to visit him. His cousin, Xu Zhendong, telegraphed Niu Huisheng to come and provide medical treatment. At 8:20 AM, Dr. Niu arrived at the hospital with Dr. Cao Chentao. However, Dr. Bader from Baolong Hospital had not yet arrived by 8:40 AM. At the time, Dr. Niu immediately believed that surgery was imperative and could not be delayed any longer. At 8:45 AM, he was transported to the Red Cross Society on Haige Road for treatment. It was found that Tang had sustained three gunshot wounds: two in his right arm and one in his bladder. The bladder wound was the most serious, and the bullet was still lodged inside.</p>
<p>▲ Dies Yesterday Afternoon: Surgery was performed immediately on his lower abdomen, and it was discovered that his bladder had been pierced in three places, which were repaired. However, the bullet could not be removed. When Tang was at Baolong Hospital, his spirits were still good, and he was still conscious. However, after the surgery, his temperature suddenly rose at around 11:00 AM. At 11:30 AM, he succumbed to his injuries and could not be saved. His family members quickly moved his body to the Universal Funeral Parlor and scheduled the funeral for this Saturday (the 25th).</p>
<p>▲ Mr. Tang's Brief Biography: Tang Yuluo was 32 years old and a native of Jinhua, Zhejiang. In 1920, he graduated from Harvard University in the United States, majoring in economics and earning a master's degree. After returning to China, he served as a secretary for Feng Yuxiang and later became the chief editor of the English-language "Continental Daily News" in Shanghai. When Qian Dajun served as the Songhu Garrison Commander, Tang served as his secretary. Tang had served as a secretary in the Ministry of Finance for three years, working in the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Finance. He was recently promoted to confidential secretary and was highly trusted by Minister Song. Tang accompanied Song on his trips between Nanjing and Shanghai. Just last week, Tang accompanied Song to Nanjing. He returned to Shanghai with Song yesterday morning, a matter of only two days.</p>
<p>▲ Newly Married for Two Months: Mr. Tang was the brother of the socialite Tang Ying. His father, Tang Naian, passed away two years ago. Mr. Tang married the niece of the late Executive Yuan President Tan Yankai just two months ago. He lived at No. 39 Route Dufour, with only an elderly mother and no brothers. Yesterday afternoon, when the tragic news arrived, his wife was grief-stricken and fainted repeatedly. She was revived by medical attention. The whole house was filled with cries, a truly tragic scene. Guo Dehua, Secretary of the Ministry of Finance, and Tang Haian, Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, personally went to offer their condolences.</p>
<p>▲ Number of Injured: Yesterday morning, in addition to Tang Yufu, who died, a total of ten people were wounded by gunshots. The details are listed as follows: (1) Wang Shiduo, a secretary of the Control Yuan with the rank of senior appointee, injured in the right foot by a hand grenade, at Fumin Hospital; (2) Min Ziqing, a guard of Song Ziwen, injured in the right leg by a hand grenade, at Baolong Hospital; (3) Wang Xifang, gunshot wound to the right foot, currently the supply director of the 33rd Independent Brigade, at Baolong Hospital; (4) Zhang A'gen, 54 years old, from Suzhou, bullet entered from the back and exited from the left waist, perforated colon, life in critical condition, at Renji Hospital; (5) Zhang Zhenxiang, 36 years old, from Nanxiang, gunshot wound to the right ear; (6) Lin Jingfang, 27 years old, adjutant of the 8th Regiment of the 2nd Guard Division, Cantonese, picked up a bomb, four fingers of his right hand were blown off, and his face was injured, at Renji Hospital; (7) Ding Xueyuan, 21 years old, from Hubei, guard soldier, gunshot wound to the head, at Renji Hospital; (8) Liu Baoqing, 40 years old, grocery store owner, bullet in the buttocks, at Renji Hospital; (9) Zheng Jinian, railway police officer, hand grenade injury to the lower jaw; (10) Zhu Yuwen, 32 years old, rickshaw puller, bullet grazed the right eye. It is said that there were at least a dozen others who sustained minor injuries from stray bullets and went to various hospitals for treatment on their own.</p>
<p>▲ Weapons Recovered: After the incident, the police department of the two railways recovered a Mauser pistol, two Brownings, and a hand grenade from the hall. The Mauser pistol still had two bullets in it. All were sent to the Fifth District Police Station for safekeeping. Yesterday afternoon at around 3:00 PM, Tang Haian, Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, went to the station to inspect and retrieved the weapons from the Fifth District Police Station for reference. In addition, a handgun with seven bullets inside was also recovered by Chinese and foreign detectives from the side of the border road near the iron shed opposite the station and stored in the Huikuisi police station.</p>
<p>▲ Hand Grenade Explosion: At 8:17 AM, railway police officers were re-investigating the area and found a handkerchief-wrapped object stuffed into a crack in the western iron shed. They suspected it was an explosive device placed there by the assailants. Railway police officer Zheng Jiyuan was stationed to guard it, waiting for a way to safely remove and destroy it. Unexpectedly, Lin Jingfang, a Cantonese adjutant from the 8th Regiment of the 4th Brigade of the National Government Guard Army, who had come to Shanghai from Nanjing on the night train, passed by the area after disembarking from the train. Upon hearing people say that the package contained a bomb, Lin bent down to pick it up. Although Officer Zheng advised him not to take the risk, Lin, relying on his long experience in battle, was not afraid of firearms. He still reached out to take it, saying it was to prevent harm to others. As soon as he reached out, a loud explosion went off inside the package. Four fingers of Lin's hand, which had taken the package, were blown off, and his left hand, chest, and face were all injured. The lower jaw of railway police officer Zheng Jiyuan was also injured by shrapnel. A rickshaw puller named Zhu Yuwen, who was passing by at the time, was also affected and injured in the corner of his eye.</p>
<p>▲ Temporary Martial Law: When the bombs exploded and the gunfire rang out, passengers in the station scrambled to escape, and the order was quite chaotic. Passengers on the Routes 5 and 6 trams stopped at the border road also got off and fled at the sound of the gunfire. Rumors flew everywhere. The concession police station dispatched a large number of armed detectives to the border road and imposed temporary martial law. Soldiers from the Sixth Division of the Fifth Army also stood guard in the station, armed and declaring martial law. You Bolu, the chief of the Fifth District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, upon hearing the news, immediately dispatched Inspector Li with armed police officers to investigate the scene. However, the assailants had already fled and disappeared without a trace. Later, police officer Chen Changmin found two rows of bullets on the ground in front of the station and took them to the district for record. The district chief immediately went to the Public Security Bureau to report the incident to Director Chen Xizeng.</p>
<p>▲ Song's Interview: Afterwards, Finance Minister Song Ziwen issued a statement saying, "I arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing on the overnight express train, arriving at the station at 7:00 AM this morning. After getting off the train, I walked to a point about fifteen feet from the station door when I suddenly heard gunshots coming from both sides. I knew that someone was trying to assassinate me. I took off the white hat I was wearing and threw it into a dark corner of the station to avoid being conspicuous, and I mingled with the crowd, hiding behind a pillar. I also drew my handgun for self-defense. As soon as I reached the pillar, I heard the sound of an exploding bomb, two loud bangs. Smoke filled the station, and bullets flew in all directions. My guards also returned fire. The shooting lasted for about five minutes before it stopped. By this time, everyone except my party had fled the station. According to what my guards saw, at least four assailants were firing guns, or perhaps more than that. When the smoke cleared, I saw that my secretary, Mr. Tang Yuluo, had fallen, shot. Tang was walking shoulder to shoulder with me when the assailants opened fire. He was hit in the bladder, hip, and arm. The bullets came from both sides. There were bullet holes in his hat and briefcase. I am taller than him and escaped without any injury, which is truly unbelievable. Mr. Tang has died from his injuries. Two of my guards were also injured, one seriously. Passengers were also injured. I have received repeated warnings that people in Guangzhou were plotting against me, but I did not expect them to take such an extreme measure as to attempt assassination."</p>
<p>▲ Guard's Interview: In Finance Minister Song's statement, he said that two of his guards were injured, one seriously, but after inquiring with various parties, it was said that only one guard was injured. Our newspaper reporter interviewed the injured guard, Min Ziqing, at Baolong Hospital last night. The shrapnel from Min's right leg had not yet been removed. He was in good spirits. According to him, only one of the six guards was injured. The situation at the time was extremely dangerous. There were about six or seven assailants in sight, all young men wearing white long gowns. At first, they fired handguns, and then they used hand grenades. We had two portable machine guns and four new-style rifles, but we used the new-style rifles this morning because we were afraid that the portable machine guns would injure innocent people. The entire hall was filled with smoke, and we lost our target, allowing the assailants to escape, which is regrettable.</p>
<p>▲ Secretary Wang's Interview: Wang Shiduo, a secretary of the Control Yuan who was recovering from his injuries at Fumin Hospital yesterday, told the reporter, "I came to Shanghai on the night train. After arriving at the North Station this morning (i.e., yesterday morning), I got off the train and exited the station. As I walked to the gate of the information desk, there was a sudden loud noise. Then, bullets came from all directions, front, back, left, and right. The sound of gunfire filled my ears. I quickly lay down on the ground to avoid the bullets. At that time, I was disoriented, so I could not recognize what was happening around me, nor the faces and clothing of the assailants. I did not even feel the pain of the shrapnel wound to my right foot. After the incident, I only knew that my right foot was bleeding and injured. So I exited the station, hired a car, and went to Fumin Hospital for treatment."</p>
<p>▲ Director Chen's Interview: A reporter from the "New Voice News Agency" made a special trip to interview Chen Xizeng, the director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, to clarify the truth of the matter and asked for information. Director Chen said, "I received the alarm at 7:30 AM this morning and first went to Minister Song's residence to inquire. Upon meeting Minister Song, I saw that he was safe and sound, and I was relieved. According to eyewitnesses at the scene, the perpetrators were mostly wearing white clothes and speaking Cantonese. From this, it seems that it was done by Cantonese reactionaries. As for the reasons, they are not yet fully understood. I have strictly ordered my subordinates to secretly investigate. However, the police authority within the railway bureau's boundaries has always been the responsibility of the railway police. Therefore, the south side of the iron shed door outside the two-railway station is the concession, and the inside of the iron shed is entirely controlled by the railway police. The Municipal Public Security Bureau police are far away at the Baoshan Road intersection. The only person dispatched to the station is one person who is responsible for inspecting luggage for contraband, who works with the investigation team of the Garrison Headquarters. Except in special circumstances, the Municipal Public Security Bureau police are not allowed to go to the station entrance without permission. In this incident, if it were not for the efforts of Minister Song's guards, the consequences would have been unimaginable. However, Nanjing and Shanghai are close, and important officials of the National Government travel back and forth frequently. The Bureau is restricted by its authority and precedents, so it is difficult to fully fulfill its responsibilities, which is regrettable. I sincerely hope that the Ministry of Railways will learn from the past and make changes in the future, so that the police of the Bureau can cooperate with the railway police. This would prevent unexpected dangers from happening again and would be more convenient in other matters, such as checking car licenses and arresting criminals. Within the station, it is often difficult to get the railway police to fully assist. It is necessary to formally notify them in advance before execution, which is like dealing with the concession police station. The division of authority is fragmented, which is very strange."</p>
<p>▲ Condolences to Mr. Song: After the incident occurred, important figures in Shanghai, such as Mayor Zhang Qun, Jianghai Customs Superintendent Tang Haian, and important figures in the banking industry, visited Mr. Song's residence to offer their condolences. Mr. Song rested at his residence in the morning. At around 5:00 PM in the afternoon, he went to Kong Xiangxi's residence to visit Mrs. Kong.</p>
<p>▲ Inspection of the North Station: After the incident occurred yesterday morning, at around 8:00 AM, the Longhua Garrison Headquarters dispatched a platoon of soldiers to the station to provide protection. The Public Security Bureau also sent armed police officers to maintain order, creating a tense atmosphere. The reporter went to the North Station to inspect at around 10:00 AM in the morning and saw more than a dozen bullet holes in the ceiling of the hall. There were also several bullet holes in the wall and glass windows of the inspection office. There was a large bullet hole in the lower part of the cement column on the right side. Station staff members who were present yesterday morning were all frightened, which showed the intensity of the fierce battle at the time.</p>
<p>▲ One Suspect: After the incident, the Public Concession Police Department dispatched detectives to arrest the assailants. They soon apprehended one suspect in the Anle Hotel on North Zhejiang Road.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>It is said that his surname is, given name Dan, from, 23 years old. He went to the Anle Hotel at about 6:00 AM, and went out half an hour later, saying he was going to eat. He returned at about 7:30 AM. It is also said that he came to Shanghai on the same train as Mr. Song and previously studied at the Central Military Academy in Nanjing. Because there are suspicions, the concession handed him over to the Chinese authorities for interrogation.</p>

<p>The Spirit Remains - The Soul Returns</p>
<p>This, coupled with the cloudy skies and continuous heavy rain, seemed as if the heavens themselves could not bear the grief and indignation. It was not until after 12:00 PM that businesses reopened uniformly. In the Chinese areas, the major stores on Zhonghua Road and Minguo Road also lowered flags to half-mast and closed in the morning. The lowering of flags on the main roads was quite consistent, and it did not stop due to the heavy rain.</p>
<p>▲ Venue Arrangement: The Party and National flags were hung at the entrance, with a bamboo and cloth horizontal plaque reading "Shanghai Municipal All-Circles Memorial Service for the Deceased Overseas Chinese in Korea" placed horizontally. At the entrance of the venue, there was a mourning couplet from the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Department: "Dying at home is not as good as dying for the country," "Catching the thief is not as good as catching the king." The venue was filled with mourning couplets and scrolls sent by all sectors. In the memorial hall, the spirit tablets of the deceased overseas Chinese in Korea were enshrined, surrounded by many wreaths. Mourning couplets from the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce were hung on both sides. The entire venue was white, extremely desolate.</p>
<p>▲ Participating Organizations: The organizations that participated yesterday included the First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth District Party Departments, as well as their branches; various district education associations; agricultural associations; publishing industry guilds; cigarette industry guilds; lithographic industry guilds; knitting industry guilds; shipbuilding industry guilds; water and electricity industry guilds; newspaper delivery industry guilds; transportation industry guilds; coal industry guilds; cotton fabric industry guilds; military uniform industry guilds; tobacco industry guilds; Korean community associations; National Goods Preservation Association; women's associations; and more than 300 other organizations, with more than 2,000 representatives.</p>
<p>▲ Conference Officials: The presidium consisted of Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yansong, Hou Dachun, Yu Qiaqing, Tao Baichuan, Lu Jingshi, and Chen Tingrui. The chief celebrant was Ye Huijun, the master of ceremonies was Zheng Chengqing, the recorder was Xue Guangqian, and the receptionists were Yuan Hongjun, Li Zhang, Chen Quyun, and Zhang Honghai.</p>
<p>▲ Conference Order: 1. All stand at attention; 2. Presidium takes their seats; 3. Chief celebrant takes office (Ye Huijun); 4. Play mournful music; 5. Sing the Party anthem; 6. Bow three times to the Party and National flags and the portrait of the Prime Minister; 7. Chairman respectfully reads the Prime Minister's will (Wang Tingsong); 8. Silent tribute for three minutes to mourn the deceased overseas Chinese in Korea; 9. Respectfully present wreaths; 10. Respectfully read the memorial text (Wang Xiaolai); 11.

<p>▲ Chairman's Report: After the ceremony was performed as scheduled, Wang Xiaolai was nominated by the presidium to give a report, briefly stating: "Today we are holding this conference to mourn the deceased overseas Chinese, and all industries in the city have stopped business for half a day and uniformly lowered flags to half-mast to express our grief. This shows that the national spirit of our country is no longer what it used to be. Today's meeting is held on the one hand to commemorate the overseas Chinese, and on the other hand to hold the re-swearing ceremony for the committee members of the Anti-Japanese and Aid-to-Overseas-Chinese Association. Recalling the wanton brutality of the Japanese this time can be called an unprecedented catastrophe for Chinese overseas Chinese. If the people of the whole country do not rise up to help with such a tragedy, the international status will inevitably decline further. Now the Anti-Japanese and Aid-to-Overseas-Chinese Association has been formally established, and all anti-Japanese measures are being planned and implemented in detail. I hope that the people will work together and cooperate with the Anti-Japanese and Aid-to-Overseas-Chinese Association to move forward, and there will be satisfactory results in the future. This is the responsibility of those who survive. The occurrence of this incident was tragic, and heaven and earth wept. It is indeed a crisis for the Chinese nation to strive for its own survival."</p>
<p>▲ Third Conference Memorial Text: On July 23rd, the 20th year of the Republic of China, the Shanghai All-Circles Anti-Japanese and Aid-to-Overseas-Chinese Committee respectfully offers a sacrifice of modest wine and pure food to the spirits of the deceased overseas Chinese in Korea, saying: Alas, without diligent effort, how can people live and rest in peace? Seeking a livelihood in foreign lands is like floating duckweed, rootless and drifting, left to the mercy of others, like a knife and cutting board. Korea, the three Hans, is the same vein as our divine land. People of the same race have interacted for centuries. People of Lu crossed the sea to the east, like water returning to a valley, each receiving a share, forming villages of their own. Fraud and deception were dispelled, and they lived in peace, farming and cultivating. But misfortune arrived, and Japan grew violent. Thieves hated their masters, bullying the weak with the strong, employing tiger cubs and stirring up locusts, invading and plundering. In the shadows of Pyongyang, in the outskirts of Seoul, they cut down trees and raised poles, conducting a great search for ten days. Alas, our overseas Chinese, their strength restricted, like overturned nests with no intact eggs, like frost falling on duckweed. Merchants lost their assets, farmers lost their harvests. Escaping from the jaws of tigers, they were satiated with the edge of swords. Six thousand gentlemen, reduced to insects and monkeys. Who will avenge the national shame? Who will act as a shepherd? May your spirits be aware, accept this one drink. Enjoy the sacrifice.</p>
<p>▲ Committee Oath: After the chairman recited the memorial text, all the committee members of the Anti-Japanese and Aid-to-Overseas-Chinese Association took their re-oath of office. The oath read: "We swear in all sincerity that under the leadership of the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Department of the Chinese Kuomintang, we will strive to work against Japan and aid overseas Chinese. We will not be self-serving, we will not engage in corruption, we will work diligently, and we will use people with caution. If we violate this oath, we are willing to accept the most severe punishment. We solemnly swear."</p>
<p>▲ Representative's Speech: Huang Zhaoxiong, the representative of the Municipal Party Department, gave a speech, briefly stating: "This time, the Japanese instigated the Korean people to massacre overseas Chinese, and all Chinese people are filled with righteous indignation. Today's memorial service should recognize that this Japanese action against China is a systematic and planned implementation of the policy of invading and occupying Manchuria and Mongolia. The affected overseas Chinese are now suffering death and injury. I hope that the people of the country will unite to help the overseas Chinese, use the entire strength of the people to engage in the relief movement, and, on the one hand, unite as a whole to be the government's backing in diplomatic relations with Japan. Then the future of the nation will probably have hope.</p>
<p>▲ Speeches from All Sectors: The representative of the Korean United Association gave a speech, briefly stating: "This time, the Japanese instigated the Korean people to massacre overseas Chinese, and I would like to express my apologies on behalf of all the Korean people. However, the occurrence of this tragedy was not the intention of the Korean people themselves. Because Korea is a conquered country, a colony, not comparable to other independent countries. Under the iron heel of Japanese imperialism, there is no freedom of action to speak of. It was entirely the Japanese who used bad elements of the Korean people to massacre overseas Chinese. Please, nationals of your esteemed country, be understanding and please support the Korean people's liberation movement. Next, Cai Guo Jingluan, Liu Zhongda, the representative of the Incheon Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Korea, Lin Kecong, the representative of the Women's Association, and Zhu Xuefan, the representative of the workers, gave very painful speeches (details omitted). Finally, Tao Baichuan, nominated by the presidium, gave a closing speech and adjourned the meeting.</p>
<p>▲ Conference Slogans: (1) To mourn the deceased overseas Chinese, we must strive for the anti-Japanese movement; (2) To mourn the deceased overseas Chinese, we must strictly implement economic severance; (3) All compatriots, unite to avenge the deceased overseas Chinese; (4) All compatriots across the country, unite and permanently sever economic ties with Japan; (5) All compatriots across the country, unite and overthrow Japanese imperialism; (6) The spirit of the deceased overseas Chinese will never die!</p>

<h3>Confiscation of Japanese Goods Continues</h3>
<p>▲ Transportation Industry Announces Suspension of Transport</p>
<p>Since the Anti-Japanese Aid-the-Compatriots Committee resolved that all Japanese goods are not allowed to be moved and began inspection work on one hand, Japanese goods being transported for export have been seized at any time. As a result, the transportation industry decided yesterday to notify all colleagues to suspend the collection of Japanese goods from today (the 24th). The news yesterday is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Continued Confiscation The Committee received a tip the day before yesterday that a large batch of Japanese goods was about to be smuggled to Hangzhou on the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo line at the South Station. The Inspection Section of the Committee immediately sent personnel to confiscate them. The details were recorded in yesterday's newspaper. It is now reported that the number of Japanese goods is actually more than 1,100 tons. Except for 400 tons that had already been loaded onto the train when the Anti-Japanese Committee sent personnel to seal them off and could not be stopped, the remaining 700 tons were all confiscated at the station. More than a dozen officials from the Inspection Section of the Committee guarded the station overnight in the rain. Yesterday, the Railway Bureau temporarily handed over the goods to the railway warehouse for safekeeping, pending a resolution by the Anti-Japanese Committee. Also, at 5:00 PM yesterday, a large batch of Japanese goods at the North Station was trying to be shipped out and was discovered and confiscated by the Committee. It is reported that the Committee has also rented a patrol boat for the transportation of Japanese goods in the middle waterway of the Huangpu River to closely patrol and prevent any escape.</p>
<p>▲ Suspension of Japanese Goods Transportation The Shanghai Transportation Industry Association issued a notice yesterday, saying: "For the matter of the notice, we have received a letter from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, based on the four measures for the disposal of Japanese goods decided by the Shanghai All-Circles Anti-Japanese Aid-the-Compatriots Committee, hoping that everyone will pay attention, etc." According to the industry, it is acting as an agent for the transportation of goods, and there is no distinction between accepting customer goods. During this anti-Japanese wave, before the announcement, Japanese goods that have been received, or that are still stored in the railway warehouse due to lack of vehicles, or that have already been transported to the middle of the journey and have not yet arrived at the destination, are inevitable. It is quite difficult to conduct a detailed investigation for a while, and it is deeply feared that it will be implicated for no reason. Therefore, the company convened an emergency meeting of all colleagues in the city today and decided on four measures as follows: (A) The Japanese goods that have been received but have not yet been transported will be checked in detail by the end of today and reported to the association. The association will compile a detailed list and report it to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for registration. (B) From today (ie, the 24th), the collection of Japanese goods will be suspended, and a notice will be posted at the cargo warehouses at both Maigen Road and the North Station to make it known to everyone. (C) The association will issue a wooden stamp with the words "Jointly agreed by the industry, if there are any Japanese goods or disguised goods in the consigned goods, once discovered, the cargo owner will be responsible, and the carrier will not be involved," etc., and distribute them to the industry for universal use. (D) For those that have been transported out but have not yet reached the destination, or have just arrived but have not yet been unloaded, the local industry should report to the association for registration nearby. In addition to notifying the industry to comply with it, it is a special notice for the attention of all circles.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Lawyers' Association Executive and Supervisory Committee Resolves Three Lawyers' Withdrawal Cases</h3>

(Resolution) Reply to the member that the association believes that Member Ren has violated the Lawyers' Association Charter and Regulations. If he disagrees, he can handle it in accordance with Article 34 of the Lawyers' Association Charter. (2) The Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Bureau sent letters inquiring about lawyer Yan Luqing's voluntary registration on behalf of creditors of the Riye Bank and the issuance of 10% of the deposits by the Riye Bank Liquidation Office, which was abusively issued at a discount of 85%, which is tantamount to fraud. (Resolution) Recommend Committee members Tang Yingsong and Zhang Feixiong to review and report before further verification. (3) Luo Buzhou sent a letter reporting that lawyer Zheng Yuxiu had returned the public fee of 1,000 yuan and requested to withdraw the previous letter. (Resolution) Not to be withdrawn. (4) Chen Zemin, Lu Jianai, and Liu Zuwang, the third committee member, investigated the details of the witnesses and evidence of lawyer Zheng Yuwei's acceptance of public fees and dereliction of duty. The investigation report is recorded. (Recorded later) The committee members present expressed their opinions. The chairman summarized the opinions and proposed two measures: (A) Refer for disciplinary action. (B) Report the withdrawal from the association and refer for disciplinary action. Please vote. As a result, the majority passed the second measure to report to the superior court on member Zheng Yuxiu's withdrawal and request the court to refer for disciplinary action. (5) Members Ni, etc. sent a letter requesting reconsideration of member Jiang Shiyi's violation of the association rules. (Resolution) Reply to the members that if they disagree with the resolution of this meeting, they can handle it in accordance with Article 34 of the Lawyers' Association Charter. (6) Lawyers Yao Jianguang, Ke Tingzhen, Chen Feng, and Ma Hongyuan applied for membership. (Resolution) Passed. The report of the three committee members Chen Zemin, Lu Jianai, and Liu Zuwang is recorded later: For the matter of the report, on the 12th of this month, this association was recommended to quickly investigate and report on the case of Luo Buzhou's letter to lawyer Zheng Yuxiu's dereliction of duty, etc. Upon receiving this, Zemin and others immediately went to Luo Buzhou's office to inquire. Luo went to the capital for business and could not be met. They went to the witness Li Shirui's office for detailed investigation. Lawyer Li handed over the evidence for review: (1) The receipt for public fees issued by Zheng Yuxiu, with Mr. Li Cishan's name on it. (2) A delivery book with the stamp of Zheng Yuxiu's law firm on September 14th and 13th. (3) Two stubs of checks from Tongyi Trust Company. (4) Two drafts of letters requesting the return of public fees. All of the above have probative value in this case. The inquiries are recorded in detail. They also went to Tongyi Company to find out that the checks delivered by Lawyer Li for public fees were all filled in with the words "Lawyer Zheng Yuxiu" and collected by Hongsheng Qianzhuang. This was the investigation before the 19th. When the meeting was held on the 19th, another letter from Zheng Yuxiu was handed down, ordering a quick investigation and report. Therefore, on the 20th, they went to Luo Buzhou's office to meet Tan Yiqie. According to Tan, all the evidence was at Lawyer Li's office. However, he stated that he had made an appointment with Lawyer Li at Lawyer Zheng's office in October of the previous year. He had gone alone once a few days later. He had gone twice in March of last year. Lawyer Zheng was not in the office, so he had not met him. The details are also recorded in the minutes. Lawyer Wu Chengyu visited many times and did not meet him. He only spoke to Zemin once on the phone. According to him, he did not know that Lawyer Zheng was involved in the case. On the 21st, they visited Lawyer Zheng and did not meet him. Lawyer Zheng called in the morning and made an appointment. They went in the afternoon. According to Zheng, he had explained to Lawyer Li that he would not appear in court. Luo Buzhou had never been there since making the appointment. Zemin and others asked to see the entrustment contract, but he said that there was no case file, so it was not clear whether there was a contract. Moreover, the office had moved several times, so it was difficult to find it. The rest is also recorded in detail in the minutes. The three investigation records, along with the three pieces of evidence, are submitted for reference. It is also stated that the delivery book under the evidence item is needed for daily use, so it was not handed over to the meeting. This report is respectfully submitted. Investigators of the Executive and Supervisory Committee: Chen Zemin, Lu Jianai, Liu Zuwang. 20.7.13.</p>

<h3>Two Thousand Yuan in Campaign Funds for a Detective Squad Leader</h3>
<p>▲ Turns Out It Was a Big Scam</p>
<p>▲ Dared to Pay at the Public Security Bureau</p>
<p>Zhang Guobin, a local, 38 years old, used to be in the coal business and is now unemployed. On the 1st of this month, he came to Shanghai from Hangzhou to look for a job. That night, he went to the rooftop garden of the New World Company and met an old friend, Zhang Zheng from Hunan. After talking, he learned that Guobin was unemployed, so he offered to introduce him to a job, arranging to meet again at the Qinglian Pavilion teahouse at the intersection of Fuzhou Road and Hubei Road the next day. On the 2nd, Guobin and Zhang Zheng met at the Qinglian Pavilion. Zhang Zheng said that he was friendly with senior officials of the Municipal Public Security Bureau and was willing to help him find the position of captain of the First Detective Squad, arranging to meet again on the 4th. After speaking, they dispersed. On the 4th, Guobin and Zhang Zheng met at the Qinglian Pavilion again. Zhang Zheng said that he had already arranged it, but he needed</p>
<p>▲ Two Thousand Yuan in Funds as campaign funds. Guobin, eager to find a job, did not distinguish between truth and falsehood and rashly agreed. He then asked his younger brother, Zhang Tongbang, to raise 1,000 yuan in cash and went with Zhang Zheng to the Municipal Public Security Bureau to pay. When they reached the entrance of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Zhang Zheng instructed Guobin to wait at the entrance and ordered him to hand over 1,000 yuan and his resume to him inside. After a while, Zhang came out and said that he had contacted Section Chief Wang of the Third Section.</p>
<p>▲ Sent Campaign Funds He only needed to wait quietly for the appointment. The letter of appointment would be issued around the 7th or 8th, and another 1,000 yuan would be paid at that time. Guobin then went to the Shenzhou Hotel on Zhejiang Road on the 8th and opened room 421 to wait for the appointment. On the 11th, Zhang Zheng came as expected and took out No. 1715,</p>
<p>▲ A Letter of Appointment with the seals of Municipal Public Security Bureau Director Chen, Squad Leader Lu, and Section Chief Wang was handed over to Guobin, and Guobin also handed over the remaining 1,000 yuan in cash to Zhang. After receiving the money, Zhang also said that if he wanted to carry out his duties and arrest criminals, he would need to provide another certificate, which would be given in a few days. After speaking, he took the money and left. After a few days, Guobin became suspicious because he disappeared without a trace. He then asked his younger brother, Zhang Tongbang, to take the letter of appointment to the Municipal Public Security Bureau to inquire. After Director Chen examined it,</p>
<p>▲ Learned It Was Forged and ordered an investigation. Guobin then reported to the Patrol Room. Until 7:00 PM the night before last, Zhang Zheng went to Shenzhou to visit Guobin and was secretly reported to the Old Gate Patrol Room, which sent detective Yan Yu to arrest Zhang Zheng and detain him in the Patrol Room. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special District Court. According to Patrol Room lawyer Ru Bao Yi, who detailed the above situation, the Municipal Public Security Bureau sent personnel to the case today, requesting a transfer. However, according to my lawyer's opinion, the most important thing is to first study the defendant,</p>
<p>▲ The Location of the Crime Where is it? If it is in the Concession, the Municipal Council should prosecute according to law. Then Zhang Guobin and witness Zhang Tongbang surrendered, proving everything. When questioned, the defendant confessed, "I entrusted this matter to my friend Wang Chundai to handle. Wang claimed to be working in the Municipal Government. All the letters of appointment were also given to me by Wang, but I did not receive the money." According to the public security detectives who delivered the official documents, they said that they were ordered by the director because the money was delivered at the Public Security Bureau.</p>
<p>▲ There May Be Other Circumstances so they requested a transfer. Judge Xu Jiashi declared after checking the report, "After examining the circumstances of this case, the location of the crime is in both the Chinese and Concession areas. This court and the local court can both accept the case, so the court that accepted the case first should handle it." Patrol Room lawyer Ru then declared in court that he was prosecuting under Article 225 of the Criminal Law. Judge Xu then ordered a postponement of two weeks. Zhang Zheng was allowed to be taken to the Public Security Bureau for investigation and then sent back for trial.</p>
<h3>Prison Inmates on Hunger Strike</h3>

According to General Patrolman Martin, Mrs. Van has been threatening to go on a hunger strike for several days and began refusing breakfast this morning. However, the prison staff is not worried about this. If Mrs. Van really refuses to eat, the prison doctor will be called to handle it according to the usual procedures. Hunger strikes in the Public Concession Western Prison are common, but it is the first time that it has been done by Western women.</p>

<h3>Director of the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities Visits the Shanghai-South China and French Water Plants</h3>
<p>▲ Expresses Satisfaction and Approval</p>
<p>Huang Boqiao, Director of the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities, accompanied by Sun Guangyi, a technician from the Bureau, and Li Qingquan, a technician, went to the inland water plant the day before yesterday to inspect the plant's newly built rapid filter pool, clear water pool, and electrical inlet machine room, and electrical outlet machine room, and other new projects, which have all been completed. All the old-fashioned steam water pump machines have been abandoned and replaced with electric water pump machines, so the water volume is unusually abundant and the water pressure has increased several times. In terms of water quality, it has also made considerable progress compared to the past due to sand filtration and three times of green gas disinfection. After being led around by Yao Mulian, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the company, Lu Bohong, Director, Dong Engineer, and Lu, Chief of the General Affairs Section, they felt very satisfied. They then rushed to the Machine Factory Street to visit the French Water Plant, where Mr. Meng Suo, the French General Manager, personally led them. Each part from the inlet to the outlet was explained in detail. The water inlet of the plant uses a water absorption trumpet, which can automatically rise and fall with the tide, and has not experienced any failures since it started generating electricity itself in April of this year. Therefore, Huang expressed his appreciation for the plant's equipment and management.</p>
<h3>Shanghai's Future Wind and Rain</h3>
<p>Astronomer Ye Youqin predicted that the heavy thunderstorms in Shanghai on the morning of July 6th and the major earthquake in Ecuador, South America on the morning of the 17th were both closely related to the date table of earthquake storms predicted by Yu in the Shenbao on January 1st of this year. Now it is predicted again that there will be wind, rain, and high tides in Shanghai on August 14th and 15th and September 12th and 13th. This summer is a cold and rainy year, and its temperature cannot be higher than 96 degrees Fahrenheit.

<h3>Bandit Chief Lin Meisheng of Fujian Province Arrested</h3>
<p>Lin Meisheng, a well-known bandit in Fujian who had not been captured for several years, is over thirty years old, tall and strong, with piercing eyes and a fierce light shining like electricity. When he was in Fuzhou and other places, he killed and set fires almost every day. Now, the local authorities are sending detectives out day and night to visit and arrest him. Lin then sneaked into Shanghai, first staying in the Public Concession. On the day of his arrest, he suddenly rented a room at No. 3 Anle Palace Hotel on Aiduya Road. Deng Jingming, the chief of the detective team of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, learned of Lin's whereabouts. At the same time, an official from Fujian came to report that the bandit was hiding in the Public Concession and asked for assistance. Therefore, he immediately dispatched officers Yang Fengqi, Xu Pengfei, Wang Bin, etc., on the 21st, together with the patrol room detectives, to rush to Anle Palace Hotel in the French Concession, where the bandit Lin was last hiding, and captured him. However, since Lin was fierce and brave, he was unwilling to be captured without a fight. Moreover, the captors were in a hotel and it was inconvenient to draw guns and open fire, hurting tourists. Therefore, the two sides fought hand-to-hand, and the situation was extremely fierce. However, in the end, due to the disparity in strength, Lin surrendered when he was exhausted. It is reported that he was taken back by the detective team for questioning on the afternoon of the 22nd.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Pudong Fellow Villagers Association Initiated</h3>
<p>The number of Pudong fellow villagers traveling to Shanghai is increasing day by day, with no fewer than 300,000 people in the industrial and commercial circles. However, there is a lack of huge unity and strict organization, so the emergency relief for Pudong fellow villagers and the facilities of the cause have not been able to fully assist. Therefore, Du Yuesheng, Lü Yuequan, and other people in Shanghai initiated the organization of the Shanghai Pudong Fellow Villagers Association. Yesterday afternoon at 7:00 PM, a meeting of initiators was specially convened on the eighth floor of the Hua'an Building. Those present included Du Yuesheng, Wang Yiting, Ye Huijun, Mu Jichu, Huang Renzhi, Zhang Shangyi, Yang Qingyuan, Pan Hongding, and seventy-seven others.

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities Relieves the Water Shortage in Chongdeli, Zhabei</h3>
<p>▲ Urging the Addition of Public Faucets</p>
<p>There are more than 20 bungalows opposite Chongdeli on Nantong Road, Zhabei, with only one public tap installed. During this hot summer, the demand for water is urgent and insufficient, resulting in frequent disputes among residents. Moreover, the tap is set up on the side of the road, and anyone can take it at will, so there are even more disputes. After the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities received a report from the residents there, it sent personnel to investigate and confirmed that it was true. The owner, Chen Shunji, was instructed to add several public taps before the end of this month to provide relief. It is reported that the owner has expressed his intention to comply.</p>
<h3>Investigation of Water Expert Hill to Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Great America Evening Post said that Hill, the American expert hired by the Municipal Council to investigate the Water Company, is now scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the Japanese Queen ship on September 1st. After arriving in Shanghai, he will immediately start work and is expected to complete it in six weeks. The public fee is 12,000 US dollars. According to Hill's appointment, it is due to the opposition of Chinese taxpayers in the Public Concession to the Water Company's price increase. Therefore, the Municipal Council specially hired experts to come to Shanghai to investigate the company's accounts and management methods to see if there are any ways to save money.</p>
<h3>A Famous Beach Opera Star, Shi Xiangyun, Stage a Home Theft</h3>
<p>▲ Two Women Suffer Unjust Accusations</p>
<p>A certain Mrs. Yong, residing near Xiaobeimen, set up a steamed rice stall daily at the entrance of a rice shop south of the Ningfeng Inn on Min'an Road. This spring, a fellow villager, surnamed Fei, entrusted her with the care of a foster son, providing a monthly allowance of six yuan for nursing. During business hours, she always brought the child, who sat on a mat beside her. A woman selling cakes at a nearby stall also cherished the child, often holding and playing with him, which became customary. Unexpectedly, on the third day of the fifth lunar month, while Mrs. Yong was selling rice, the child sitting on the mat beside her suddenly disappeared. Suspecting the cake-selling woman of conspiring to abduct the child, they engaged in heated arguments, but the doubts remained unresolved. When the foster parent learned of this, he sent out scouts everywhere, but to no avail. He then beat a gong and searched along the streets and alleys for several days, but it was like searching for a yellow crane – impossible. Unable to do otherwise, he reported to the police station, even having both Mrs. Yong and the cake-selling woman arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to abduct the child. More than a month passed, and the injustice remained unaddressed. It wasn't until the afternoon of the 21st of this month, at three o'clock, that someone discovered the child at the home of Shi Xiangyun, a famous beach opera singer, in the third lane of the Mintiniyin Road. The foster parent reported this to the Songshan Road Police Station, which immediately dispatched detectives to Shi's home. They found a six-month-old boy under the stairs. It was said that the child had been secretly taken by Shi Xiangyun's female apprentice. Now, Shi's father, Liansheng, has hired a wet nurse to care for the child at home. The unjust case has finally come to light.</p>
<h3>Chief Clerk Accused of Seducing an Underage Girl</h3>
<p>Sun Fusheng, a Suzhou native, age 41, working as a chief clerk at the residence of a certain Westerner at No. 1490 Xiafei Road in the French Concession, has recently engaged lawyer Chen Bingxing to file a lawsuit with the Special District Court, accusing Yang Genquan of No. 244 Xinzha Road and Qian Asan, a chief clerk working for a Westerner in Room 3, No. 181 Maitini Road in the French Concession, of obstructing marriage and other offenses. The essence of his lawsuit is as follows:</p>
<p>For seducing an ignorant girl and eloping with her privately, and for filing an incidental private prosecution. My own daughter, Fengdi, is currently 19 years old and studies at Tongyi Public School. She is honest and chaste. In order to avoid a desolate old age, I adopted a son early on, hoping he would marry into the family and provide support. However, the first defendant, Yang Genquan, a married man, saw that Fengdi was slightly attractive and had been coveting her for a long time, attempting to seduce her in every possible way. Furthermore, the second defendant, Qian Asan, incited her to elope secretly. Fengdi, with her weak will, was swayed by them and, on the 12th of May this year, took her clothes and jewelry and disappeared without a trace. That same day, at 2 p.m., I suddenly received a letter from Yang, filled with absurd and baseless claims. After reading it, I reported it to the police station and posted advertisements in search of her, but without any results. Later, I received a letter from Dai Jien, a lawyer representing Yang, stating that Yang had already cohabitated with Fengdi, but the address was not clear. I immediately went to lawyer Dai's office to negotiate, but he instead advised me to sign an agreement acknowledging Yang as my son-in-law. However, I am nearing the age of knowing my fate and only have this one daughter to rely on in my old age. Yang already has a wife and children. He is clearly seducing a girl under the age of 20, and his actions constitute a crime under Article 257 of the Criminal Law, without a doubt. Moreover, Qian Asan had previously incited her to elope and provided methods for doing so, constituting a crime under Article 258 of the Criminal Law. Therefore, I am filing this lawsuit, requesting that they be arrested and punished according to the law, and that the defendants be ordered to hand over Fengdi to me and return the stolen clothes, etc. After reviewing the complaint, the court approved the request and issued summonses. Yesterday morning, judge Cheng Shangfeng ascended to the third court of the High Court and conducted a preliminary hearing. The defendants did not appear, but lawyer Chen Wenxiang appeared in court and requested a postponement. Judge Cheng verified the report, questioned the plaintiff, and ordered a postponement for a later hearing.</p>
<h3>Tailor Covets Neighbor's Adopted Daughter-in-Law</h3>
<p>▲ Attempted Affair Ends in Frustration and Rage</p>
<p>▲ Mother and Daughter-in-Law Severely Wounded</p>
<p>Cao Er, a 44-year-old road worker from Tongzhou, rented a rear flat at No. 15 Tanjiabang, Jiangwan Road. His wife, Mrs. Li, was 42 years old. His son, Xiao Bing, was 20 years old and also a road worker. They also had an adopted daughter-in-law, Ms. Ma, who was only 15 years old. The family of four relied on the father and son's hard labor for a meager living. Their landlord, Chen Gengquan, was a local tailor, 22 years old, unmarried, and living alone. He often saw the adopted daughter-in-law, Ms. Ma, who had a slight beauty and a small-town charm, and therefore, the idea of coveting her arose spontaneously. When Cao Er and Xiao Bing were not at home, he would often flirt with Ms. Ma, intending to seduce her. Over time, Cao Er discovered this and urgently wanted to move. He recently canceled the lease with Chen. Unexpectedly, Gengquan harbored insidious intentions, immediately falsely claiming that your wife still owes several yuan, quickly settling it will allow you to move. Mrs. Li listened to the words, started theorizing with her, and verbal arguments occurred. Yesterday, both sides invited neighbors to listen and judge, and Lu Zhonglian came forward to mediate, and the matter was settled. When Cao and his son were moving furniture, Mrs. Li was busy cooking. Chen saw an opportunity to take advantage of and immediately grabbed the arm of the adopted daughter-in-law, Ms. Ma, forcibly pulling her into the room, intending to commit indecency. Ms. Ma was greatly frightened and called out loudly. Her mother-in-law heard the alarm and arrived. Chen, upon seeing Mrs. Li, was like meeting an enemy on a narrow road. He immediately grabbed a kitchen knife and slashed Mrs. Li ten times on the head, back, and arms. The adopted daughter-in-law saw her mother-in-law covered in blood and shouted for help. Chen then rushed over and slashed the adopted daughter-in-law, Ms. Ma, more than ten times on the head, causing blood to splatter, a tragic sight to behold. Gengquan, seeing that he had caused such a disaster, suddenly contemplated suicide. He went into the room and immediately took off his pants belt and hanged himself. People came forward to rescue him while reporting to the Fifth District, Third Precinct Public Security Bureau, ordering the police to come and detain Chen at the precinct. After the chief interrogated him, he ordered him to be detained and sent to the Zhabei Judicial Section for review. The injured woman was ordered to be sent to Tongren Hospital in police car No. 3022 and then transferred to Guangren Hospital for treatment. It is said that the adopted daughter-in-law, Ms. Ma, was injured in two places on her skull, and her condition was not light.</p>
<h3>Chinese National Invents Mosquito Repellent</h3>
<p>Mr. Zeng Ziyun, who had studied chemistry in Europe for a long time, recognizing that mosquito repellent is an indispensable item in the summer but imported products are too expensive, meticulously researched and manufactured "Flying God" brand mosquito repellent, which also kills ants, flies, fleas, and the like, to meet the needs of society. The efficacy is remarkable, priced at one yuan per bottle. He has entrusted Wing On, Sincere, Sun Sun, Tze Cheng, and major pharmacies to sell it on consignment.</p>
<h3>Preparation for a Domestic Galvanized Iron Sheet Factory</h3>
<p>It is found that galvanized iron sheet is an essential item for construction, with annual imports exceeding 600,000 piculs. Initially, it came from the United Kingdom, followed by Germany and the United States competing to contend. Recently, the Japanese imitated the manufacturing, and within three years, they unexpectedly became dominant. The goods from the United Kingdom, the United States, and Germany were all crowded out. In the national market, Japanese goods account for sixty to seventy percent. Currently, Mr. Wang Gechen, general manager of China Steel Products Company, and important figures in the iron industry, in view of this, have united with comrades to initiate China Galvanized Iron Manufacturing Co., Ltd., to establish a factory in Shanghai to manufacture galvanized iron sheet, with a capital of 300,000 yuan in national currency. They will first build the first factory, with an annual output of about 200,000 piculs of galvanized iron, which can reduce imports by one-third. In the future, they will gradually expand to achieve self-reliance. The raw materials required, except for black iron sheet, which the country cannot manufacture yet, will be temporarily ordered from the Tin Kingdom. The remaining sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, white alkali, and tin will all be domestic products. At a time when the anti-Japanese goods trend is in full swing, this self-made factory is a fundamental solution for crowding out Japanese goods. Those with aspirations, why not join in?</p>
<h3>Huatong Electric Appliance Factory Hosts Banquet</h3>
<p>Huatong Electric Appliance Machine Factory, established for many years, has a remarkable reputation. Recently, due to the development of business, the old site on Dixiwei Road was insufficient, so they moved to No. 131 Zhoujiazui Road.

Entertainment was provided during the banquet, and it did not end until around eleven o'clock.</p>
<h3>Hat-Snatching Thieves in the Min Guo Road Area</h3>
<p>▲ Leader Captured</p>
<p>Recently, a gang of bandits suddenly appeared in the Min Guo Road area of Ximen, specializing in snatching straw hats from tram passengers. Taking advantage of the fact that the tram has iron doors that close, the victims had no way to react and could only sigh in vain. For this reason, there were as many as seven reported snatchings on one day. Later, these bandits became even more rampant, even snatching the straw hats of adjutants and detectives from the headquarters and French police. Wang, the district chief of the Second District Police Station, ordered Cao Junda, the leader of the detective team, to pay attention to investigating and apprehending them. He then had the detectives disguise themselves and wait in the small alleys along Min Guo Road for these bandits. The detectives pretended to stumble and feign falling into a pit. Two bandits snatched a hat and fled, and the detectives arrested them together. They confessed that they were forced to do this due to living problems. They were sentenced to be sent to the vagrant work-study center for detention and vocational training. At the same time, Li Ada, also known as Xu Atai, was arrested on Old North Gate Min Guo Road. He was the leader, so he was sent to the District Court. After interrogation, the court ordered him to be detained and severely punished.</p>
<h3>Fei Yuqing's Daughter Killed by Car Case</h3>
<p>▲ Car Owner and Driver to Pay a Total of 1,500 Yuan</p>
<p>Fei Yuqing's daughter from Sichuan was hit and killed by a truck driven by Guo Yuchun near the Great World on Edward Road in the French Concession last month. The police station then summoned both parties to the French Court for questioning. After lawyers debated, the court ordered them to await verification and judgment on record. Yesterday was the scheduled date for the verdict, and both parties were summoned. The Chinese and Western judges ruled that the defendant driver was careless and the brake system was ineffective, making it difficult to deny culpability. The defendant and the car owner were each fined 10 yuan or detained for 5 days as a warning. The deceased in this case was also at fault, so all losses should be borne equally, estimated at 3,000 yuan. Half of the amount should be calculated, and the defendant driver and car owner jointly compensate the plaintiff for a loss of 1,500 yuan.</p>
<h3>Two Russians Litigate Over Stock Funds</h3>
<p>Russian Guse Nisky, represented by a lawyer, criminally accused Russian Walgensky in the French Court, stating that in March of this year, the plaintiff handed over three checks, each for 700 taels, totaling 2,100 taels, to the defendant Walgensky, instructing him to hand them over to a certain cosmetics company as capital. Unexpectedly, the defendant took the money and used it privately, without handing it over to the company. In this situation, he committed a criminal offense and requested that he be interrogated and the debt be recovered. The defendant, represented by lawyer Tidbeck, defended that the plaintiff, the defendant, and three others jointly opened a cosmetics company. After obtaining the plaintiff's checks, the defendant took them to the bank to discount them, netting 1,843 yuan, which, together with the defendant's capital, totaled 4,031.29 yuan, and handed it over to the company in full as capital. This can be investigated. In short, the cause of this case is that the plaintiffs wanted to revoke the defendant's shareholder status, so they used this tactic. He requested a clear investigation. Judge Zhu ruled to hear the continuation for further verification.</p>
<h3>Opium in Egg Basket on Wuxi Boat</h3>
<p>Zhang Yushu and Tian Jingsan, police chiefs of the Second Squad of the Water Patrol Team of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, led officers such as Xie Hongqi on a river patrol near the Central Warehouse Pier of the New Garbage Bridge in Beishi at about 1 a.m. the night before last. They spotted a Wuxi boat with City Permit No. 23984 docked on the north bank of the creek. They immediately boarded the boat to conduct an inspection for contraband. They found a bamboo basket at the rear rudder of the boat. Upon opening it, they found it contained colored eggs. Upon further inspection, the lower half contained white rice. They wondered why the white rice was stored in the basket with the colored eggs and became suspicious. They inserted an iron skewer into it, pulled it out, and smelled it. They detected the smell of opium and became even more suspicious. They then poured out all the rice and discovered a large package of opium, weighing about 50 taels. They took the boat owner, Xu Lanfen, along with the evidence, back to the squad and transferred them to the Nanshi Headquarters. During the preliminary interrogation by Xu, the chief of the headquarters, Xu Lanfen, a 32-year-old from Wuxi, confessed that the bamboo basket was brought to the boat by a tea servant named Asheng from the Shanghai office of the Litae Textile Company of Taicang, North City, who entrusted him to take it to Taicang and deliver it to the Litae Textile Company for inspection. He really did not know that there was opium hidden in it. Since the case involved carrying opium, which violated the prohibition regulations, he was ordered to submit a formal statement to the Third Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Telegram Requesting Thorough Investigation of Lou Wenzhao</h3>
<p>Yu Hede et al. of the Ningbo Association in Shanghai telegraphed Chairman Zhang of Zhejiang, Zhang Jianjun, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government and concurrently Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, Hangzhou: It is now reported by our fellow villager Dong Dunhuai that Dunhuai lives in Sanqishi, Cixi. On the evening of the 19th of this month, he went to the family's charity manor. He investigated why Chen Qingfu had not handled the security payment. The accountant spoke disrespectfully. He was invited to the home of Dong Jinqin, the village chief and general manager of the charity manor, for a fair discussion. Unexpectedly, Dong Jinqin sheltered his wings, and they disagreed and started hitting people. He directed his wife, daughters, and servants to hold Dunhuai's hands and feet. Dunhuai dared not fight back because he was the head of the household and was old and respected. He tried his best to avoid them and escaped home. Just as he was preparing to file a complaint, Dong Jinqin's second daughter suddenly led Lou Wenzhao, the chief of the Jinchuan Public Security Bureau, and five policemen to break into the door and arrest Dunhuai and detain him in a narrow, muddy room. The next day, after repeated requests from his family, he was allowed to provide bail. On the morning of the 21st of the same month, just as Dunhuai was getting up from bed, the bureau chief led many policemen to arrest Dunhuai again. He was not allowed to eat or change his clothes and shoes. He was tied with ropes, causing his 70-year-old mother to faint and fall. His pregnant wife was frightened and fell to the ground. They pushed and insulted him on the road in every possible way. The viewers were like mountains and all sighed. He was escorted to the county. After the county magistrate conducted a collective interrogation, Dong Jinqin only gave an oral report, falsely accusing Dunhuai of insulting his respected relatives and eating opium. Dunhuai defended himself in court and requested an investigation. He also requested that the county magistrate pay attention to the fact that the chief of the public security bureau and Dong Jinqin were colluding with each other and abusing civilians. The county magistrate issued an order to the Baoli Hospital for an investigation, proving that he did not eat opium. He was sent to the county for review and allowed to post bail for five days, temporarily restoring his freedom. Currently, in addition to Dunhuai submitting a petition to request a countersuit for legal relief, regarding the illegal abuse of civilians by the police chief, please forward it to the provincial government for investigation, etc. It is found that Dong is a child of a noble family, who studies peacefully. He had a verbal dispute with his clan over the charity manor, which is a common matter. The chief of the Jinchuan Public Security Bureau used ropes to tie him, prohibited him from changing clothes and eating, and there is suspicion of illegal abuse. Based on the previous circumstances, we urgently request that you review and order the county magistrate to thoroughly investigate the matter and punish him. It is deeply appreciated. Yu Hede et al. of the Ningbo Association in Shanghai, respectfully.</p>
<h3>Yuyao People Request Bail for Fei Jianzai</h3>
<p>Regarding Fei Jianzai (also known as De Zhao), a Yuyao native who was previously arrested by the French Public Concession, it is heard that Fei is a Yuyao gentry, nearly sixty years old, who acts righteously. He was previously the director of the defense regiment and the captain of the water patrol team, cracking down on thieves very severely, leading to resentment from the bandits. The bandits falsely accused him and pointed to him as the leader of the bandits. The Zhejiang Provincial Government consulted the French Public Concession to arrest him. He has been detained for some time. After three interrogations, it seems that there is little evidence, so he has not yet been extradited. Currently, the people of the county are all crying out for him, and thirty or forty village chiefs have jointly submitted a petition to the authorities, willing to guarantee him with their lives and property. The Shaoxing Seven Counties Association in Shanghai has telegraphed the Zhejiang Provincial Government to clear his name. It is expected that he will be released soon.</p>

<h3>Refuting the Feitham Report</h3>
<p>▲ Party Headquarters of the Two Railways Issue Declaration</p>
<p>▲ People Across the Country Should Pay Attention Together</p>
<p>The National Society says that the Shanghai Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Special Party Headquarters (namely, the Party Headquarters of the Two Railways) has issued a declaration refuting the absurd report submitted by Mr. Feitham, consultant of the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council, with pain, the original text reads, China has suffered from the constraints of unequal treaties for a long time, since the Opium War, until today, the oppression suffered by our country and nation is truly enormous and deeply painful, the exhaustion of the economy, all because the great powers use unequal treaties as tools, to increase the source of domestic chaos, the corruption of society, all because the great powers use unequal treaties as privileges, to destroy the legal system, arbitrarily carve up, raise warlords, and poison living beings, in short, the reason why our country and nation is poor, weak, declining, and corrupt, to this point, all because unequal treaties are the root cause, therefore, if our country is not free from the shackles of unequal treaties for a day, then our country and nation has no way out for a day, our party takes saving the country and saving the people as its mission, leads the national revolution, and its greatest object is to overthrow the aggression of the great powers, and abolish all its privileges, the talisman of aggression, unequal treaties, and restore our country and nation to the realm of freedom and equality, therefore, our party has been working hard on this important work day and night since the Northern Expedition was completed and unified, and has never been lazy, now, thanks to the concerted efforts of our compatriots across the country, concessions in various places have been gradually recovered, and the most unequal consular jurisdiction among unequal treaties will also be declared abolished, but the imperialists ignore justice, and spread false rumors, obstructing in various ways, recently, such as the investigation report on the concession by Feitham, consultant of the Shanghai Municipal Council, the wording is especially shocking, Mr. Feitham said that the return of the concession must have a long-term transition period, and believes that before the return, certain conditions should be fulfilled, the recovery of the concession is our country's proper and reasonable demand, and it is also our current urgent plan, the so-called concession is the land in our country rented to foreigners for residence, the sovereignty of the land belongs to us, we want to recover it and recover it, what conditions are there to fulfill? What transition period is there to go through? Moreover, the creation of the concession on that day was originally a barbaric means by which foreigners used violence to oppress, the current situation is different, how can it be taken as a permanent privilege, Mr. Feitham also said that immediately returning the concession will lose the safety of the concession, and a terror atmosphere will spread, this is deliberately making dangerous words to frighten people, it is found that the British concessions in Hankou and Jiujiang, and the Debi and other concessions in Tianjin, have all been recovered successively, and there have been no so-called unrest and terror events, the facts are there, how can one use personal speculation as an excuse to delay the return of the concession, it is also said that the FAP should be maintained, and it is suggested to replace it with a newly formed court, the abolition of consular jurisdiction, through our country's active negotiations over the years, the authorities of various countries have indeed recognized that this kind of privilege is a stain on modern civilized countries and should be cancelled, but Mr. Feitham does not understand the truth, on the one hand, he praises the rule of law of the public concession, on the other hand, he sets up this method to maintain the legal system of the concession, to advocate for the imperialists, trying to hinder the progress of the abolition, how hateful it is, it is found that the promulgation of our country's laws and the improvement of courts and prisons in recent years are no less than those of Europe and the United States, and there are many excellent legal talents, so after the abolition of consular jurisdiction, our country's courts will handle foreign people's criminal lawsuits, which must be better than the chaotic and complicated consular court, it can be asserted, Feitham's strong words and unreasonable arguments are so shameless, and Feitham is more protective of the concession, believing that the concession system is sufficient to represent a vibrant and freely functioning legal system within Chinese territory, other things such as road construction beyond the boundary, advocating co-management, adding 22 to 30 concession directors, not adding Chinese directors, what does his arrogant and exaggerated heart want to do, in fact, the concession is the source of sin, hiding dirt and filth, there is nothing that is not there, such as kidnapping and robbery, which are almost daily occurrences, excellent legal system, is that what it is, as for the prosperity of the Shanghai public concession, it is created by our Chinese people, and we should return the sovereignty to us, and our country will govern it by itself, then not only all the sins in the concession, our country will be able to clear it, and make Shanghai's prosperity more and more limitless, alas, Feitham's intention is so, it cannot be said that it is not deep, although its nature belongs to an individual, in the national movement to actively demand the abolition of the treaty, there is really no room for such absurd arguments to survive for a moment, and slightly hinder our country's lifesaving movement to abolish the treaty, hope that our people across the country will quickly rise up and plan it, this is the declaration,</p>
<h3>Public Concession Issues</h3>
<p>▲ The Municipal Council, Based on Feitham's Report</p>
<p>▲ Submits a Request to the Government to Begin Negotiations with China</p>
<p>The National Government is now taking the recovery of concessions everywhere as an important task. Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting has repeatedly expressed this. The Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council also hired Mr. Feitham, a South African judge, as an expert consultant to study the future of the concession city government. His report has been published successively by Chinese and foreign newspapers. According to sources from the Municipal Council, foreigners have expressed unanimous support after reading Feitham's report. However, its translation has not yet been completed, so the Chinese side has not been able to express its opinion. The Municipal Council believes that the best step now is to submit this Feitham report to the governments of China and foreign countries through diplomatic channels, urging them to consider it so that negotiations can begin as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Shareholders of Hanyeping Warn Sheng Zecheng</h3>
<p>▲Advocating for a Rigorous Investigation</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, the Hanyeping Coal and Iron Company, Limited, is a well-known enterprise in the country, with abundant mineral resources and a grand organizational structure, surpassing those of Japan and Russia. However, for decades, due to mismanagement, the full authority of the company has been transferred to the Japanese, and most of the Daye pig iron has been monopolized by them. Recognizing this situation, the shareholders jointly sent a warning letter to Mr. Sheng Zecheng, the company's manager, demanding the disclosure of information for reorganization. The letter reads: "To Whom It May Concern: The Hanyeping Coal and Iron Company, Limited, has been in operation for a considerable number of years, and the two share offerings totaled 30 million yuan, which is a significant investment. As the most famous mining industry in the country and a top-priority enterprise, it should benefit the nation and its people, and its ability to achieve extraordinary profits goes without saying. However, since its inception, Mr. Sheng has governed incompetently, allowing others to dominate and exploit the company. He has wholeheartedly used the production of the two mines to benefit our enemies. During the European War, coal and iron prices soared, but the company's management turned a blind eye and allowed the Japanese to buy pig iron and iron sand at the lowest prices, deceiving the nation and its people in a shocking manner. The losses incurred are immeasurable. Although the manipulation originated with the Japanese, collusion occurred within the management. They disregarded the shareholders and the country's interests. Since then, the company's management has become increasingly bold, granting full authority to the Japanese. The mine management is now under the control of the Yawata Iron Works, and the company's accounting is handled by the Japanese Imperial Government. The company deceives itself and others by paying them salaries, acting as accomplices to the enemy. The coal and iron industry is related to the rise and fall of national power. Therefore, the company's articles of association prohibit foreign shares. The late Premier Sun Yat-sen also emphasized this in his plans for national development. The National Government claims to be governed by the party and follows the teachings of the late Premier in all its measures, protecting coal and iron mines with utmost care. However, you have inherited the legacy and continued the practice of ceding national rights and inviting wolves into the house. While this may be beneficial to you, what about the shareholders? What about the country? Furthermore, the Japanese loan case has historically involved unfair low prices. During the European War, they made huge profits, which has been publicly criticized by people in Japan. According to international morality, the Japanese government has no right to say anything other than to relinquish the loan. However, you, as a Chinese citizen and a key member of the company, have failed to argue on principle, allowing the Japanese to usurp our position and acting as a puppet. What face do you have to meet the elders of the country? What is even more hateful is that the Daye mine is world-renowned, and its interests are not limited to the shareholders. The endless treasures are being surrendered to the Japanese. For decades, the annual output of ore to the Yawata Iron Works has been over 400,000 to 500,000 tons. These important raw materials are supplied to the Japanese without corresponding compensation. Even if you do not leave any room for the country, shouldn't you think about future generations? The Japanese loan agreement and the purchase contract are private actions that the shareholders cannot recognize. The shareholders have a duty to oppose the Japanese control of the company's full authority. For more than ten years, no official profits have been received, and the shares are now worthless. Furthermore, the company's accounts have not been reported, and the shareholders' meeting exists only in name, with no meetings ever convened. All of these matters fall within your scope of authority, and you should be questioned about them. Regarding the above items, we request that you provide a clear response within ten days and make it public. If you fail to do so, we will disclose the entire case and seek a just resolution through legal means. We hereby inform you and hope you will consider this. Sincerely, shareholders of Hanyeping Coal and Iron Company, Limited, Qiu Jiao Ji, Li Shen Shouting, etc. Communication address: Law Office of Feng Kan, 106 Sichuan Road."</p>
<h3>Yongjia Medical Association Requests Measures to Prevent the Spread of Fujian Plague into Wenzhou</h3>
<p>▲Letter to the National Seaport Quarantine Service</p>
<p>Dr. Wu Liande, Director of the National Seaport Quarantine Service at 2 Jiujiang Road, yesterday received a letter from the Yongjia Medical Association of Zhejiang, stating, "To Whom It May Concern: We recently learned from the Xiamen news column in the Shanghai Shibao of July 6th that the plague in southern Fujian is rampant, with outbreaks in Xiangtian Village in Xianyou County, Hanjiang Town in Putian County, Yan Nian Guan Xiamen Port, Foyun District in Zhangpu County, and Xinqiao Tou Rice Market Street in Zhangzhou, causing hundreds of deaths in succession, and there are not enough coffins to purchase, etc. Fujian Province borders southern Zhejiang. In recent years, sea transportation has become increasingly convenient, with ships arriving in the morning and evening. If the plague spreads, Pingyang's Ao River, Ruian's Feiyun River, and Yongjia's Ou River will all be entry points. In the past, the plague in Fujian Province spread to Pingyang, but fortunately, transportation was obstructed at the time, and the impact was quickly eliminated. Today, however, sea and land transportation is very different from the past, and the speed and extent of its spread are self-evident. Your office should have carefully investigated the details reported in the newspaper. If the situation is true, then for the sake of taking precautions, strict inspections should be carried out on ships traveling to and from the ports of Pingyang, Ruian, and Yongjia. These areas have never had formal quarantine agencies. Therefore, during the large-scale cholera and meningitis outbreaks in recent years, no quarantine officials were found to be diligently performing their duties. This association, in light of the past neglect of seaport quarantine and the fear of future plague transmission, must ask your office to take early measures to ensure the well-being of the people and eliminate hidden dangers. As this matter concerns urgent epidemic prevention, this letter is sent for your information and attention, and to strengthen our public duty."</p>
<h3>Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Certifies Huachang Paint</h3>
<p>▲Subjected to Chemical Testing by the Hygiene Testing Laboratory</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent an official letter to the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Civil Affairs yesterday regarding the case against Li Guohua of Huachang Manufacturing Factory, stating, "To Whom It May Concern: Our chamber previously saw a local news item in Hangzhou, which stated that over two hundred cans of health paint from the Hangzhou branch of Shanghai Huachang Paint Factory were seized and, after chemical testing by the Department of Civil Affairs, were confirmed to be opium substitutes. As the factory is a member of our chamber, the reported incidents indirectly affect the reputation of commercial organizations. We inquired with the factory about the situation and requested a detailed response. On the 22nd of this month, we received a reply from Huachang Factory, which stated, 'The health paint produced by our factory is made from useless scraps of leather and chemical solutions and does not contain opium. In July of the 18th year of the Republic of China, it was submitted to the Central Hygiene Testing Laboratory for testing, which confirmed that it was oil and issued Notification No. 24, which was received by our factory as proof. Furthermore, when our oil is exported, it is inspected by customs. If it contained opium, would customs allow it to pass? This time, the Zhejiang Department of Civil Affairs identified the health paint sold by the Hangzhou branch as an opium substitute and has detained and interrogated the manager of our branch, Huang Liquan, and Li Shengqing. Officials from Zhejiang have also been dispatched to Shanghai to investigate the factory together with Western officials from the Public Works Department. The Western officials declared on the spot that the paint produced by our factory did not contain any toxic substances and that the concession authorities had approved its operation. The officials from Zhejiang were speechless and withdrew. Therefore, the paint produced by our factory, according to the above-mentioned sales procedures and the statement of the Public Works Department officials, is purely made from scientific compounds and does not contain any toxic substances. It is evident. If the Zhejiang Department of Civil Affairs is raising the issue, what is the truth? Fortunately, the managers of our branch have been detained and are awaiting investigation, and the truth will come out. However, in today's world, it is difficult to guarantee that there will be no framing or false accusations. This must be solemnly declared and brought to your attention. We also implore you to forward this to the Zhejiang Department of Civil Affairs for an impartial investigation to avoid fabrication and to serve public justice, etc.' Attached are copies of the Central Hygiene Testing Laboratory's chemical testing certificate and the customs registration certificate. The health paint produced by Huachang Paint Factory has been tested by the Central Hygiene Testing Laboratory and confirmed to be oil without any toxic substances, with a certificate as proof. Furthermore, the products are exported and inspected by customs. If they were indeed opium substitutes, how could they be easily released? Moreover, the Public Concession has strict prohibitions on opium and has never allowed the manufacture of drugs. The factory's statement is credible. The sudden discovery of substitutes in the Hangzhou branch is suspected to be something else. Based on the above, we have enclosed copies of the chemical testing certificate and the customs registration certificate for your information."</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To Whom It May Concern: In your newspaper on the 22nd of this month, a section about the Maritime Affairs Administration taking over the customs agency mentioned fees charged by customs officials for assistance, etc. This is inaccurate and not what I said that day.

<h3>Words of Wisdom</h3>
<p>— Hanman</p>
<p>▲Sun Guoting said: "Only with the beauty of Nan Wei can one discuss She Yuan; only with the sharpness of Longquan can one discuss cutting." But generally, people often lack these abilities and like to make unfounded criticisms or act recklessly.</p>

<p>▲Being ignorant oneself and resenting those who are learned—this is speaking for the jealous. Seeking only one's own benefit and disregarding the opinions of others—this is speaking for the shameless.</p>
<p>▲Poison in a delicacy will never be eaten by those who know.</p>
<p>▲Love is like eating ginger candy: sweet at first, then spicy.</p>

<p>▲If regarding virtuous mothers and good wives as shameful for modern women, then the crisis of the nation will lie here in the future.</p>
<p>▲Love is the most treasured and secret thing at the center, and also the thing most desired to be shown to others. All suicides by lovers are merely a way to tell people things that cannot be said.</p>
<h3>Physiological Advantages of Women</h3>
<p>— Lü Bing</p>
<p>In the eyes of the Chinese, women seem to be weak and men are mostly strong. While this is not a universal truth, women who are physically stronger than men are in the minority. Unexpectedly, according to a recent publication by a German university professor, women are physiologically superior to men. This is quite a surprising statement and worthy of study.</p>
<p>The German professor's praise for women is based on the fact that women, on average, have a richer supply of vitamins than men. He gathered a large number of men and women and conducted a public experiment not long ago. The results showed that among the 330 people who lacked vitamins, only 38 were women. The professor also said that women's clothing is generally thinner than men's. For example, in severe cold weather, they wear light furs and only silk stockings on their feet, without fear of the cold. This is enough to show that strong muscles are an advantage for women. However, women may feel suspicious upon hearing this, thinking that more vitamins often lead to obesity, which is not aesthetically pleasing. In fact, this is not entirely true. The vitamins contained in women are deeply embedded in the muscles beneath the skin and develop faster than in men. Furthermore, aided by high-heeled shoes, women use their toes to exert force and sway their entire body, which is a natural exercise that prevents excessive muscle fat. It also maintains the beauty that women should possess. As for men, who do not have excessive vitamins, there is no need to perform similar exercises when walking. According to the professor's research, baldness in humans is a phenomenon caused by brain development. This is not related to the topic, so I will not elaborate.</p>
<h3>Perils of Traveling in Siberia (4)</h3>
<p>— Ping</p>
<p>▲Poor Diet: Food in the train is inedible. Seventy-seven meal tickets are given each day, providing four meals, consisting only of a few slices of sandy black bread, beefsteak, stinky fish, and sauerkraut soup, which are rotated in turn. All of them are mixed with ash and sand, not only bland and tasteless but also extremely dirty and expensive. For example, a plate of beefsteak costs US$1.40 (more than RMB 5), and an egg costs US$0.15. Even milk and butter are sour and smelly. It is better to endure hunger than to eat and get sick. Several Western friends traveling with Mr. Cao fell ill on the way, all due to poor diet.</p>
<p>▲White Russian Harassment: After the train departs, passersby along the way will throw stones and mud at the windows and passengers. The glass in the dining car and bedrooms is shattered, injuring passengers. This happened eight times in seven days in Russia. Some passengers were hit and bled from the head, some had their glasses broken, and a Western woman was injured in the waist and vomited blood. The reason given is that unemployed White Russians are using this as a way to vent their anger, which is the ultimate in boredom.</p>
<p>▲Confiscation of Equipment: The Red Russians consider items such as cameras, typewriters, telescopes, phonographs, and radios that travelers carry with them to be the possessions of capitalists and confiscate them according to old regulations. Now, they impose import taxes, which are almost arbitrary. However, photographic negatives must be developed by customs officers upon departure and are sometimes confiscated as well, for fear of exposing the inside story after the Red Russian autocracy.</p>
<p>▲Heavenly Bliss: As soon as travelers enter Manchuria, they feel like they have returned home. Everyone's faces are filled with smiles. After suffering all the way, we were all thin and exhausted. On the day of changing trains at the Sino-Russian border, everyone congratulated each other. Chinese customs officials and railway police also greeted us with smiles. We felt like we had broken through heavy encirclement, escaped from a tiger's den, and entered Penglai, ascending to a fairyland. The joy cannot be described in words.</p>
<h3>Trivial Talk About Summer Lotus</h3>
<p>— Yang Yixiao</p>
<p>▲Lotus Tea: When the lotus flower first blooms, take a small handful of fine tea leaves and wrap them in thin paper. Place them in the flower and take them out the next morning. Brew tea with it for a fresher and more delicious taste.</p>
<p>▲Lotus Dew: In the summer, collect lotus dew. The method is to use a bamboo pole to lift a clean towel and collect the dew from the lotus pond. When the towel is wet, wring it tightly into a container. The taste is sweet, and it can relieve summer heat.</p>
<p>▲Lotus Congee: Stew congee in a casserole and add a lotus leaf with its stem. Once the congee begins to boil, remove the lotus leaf. The color will be greenish and the aroma will fill your mouth.</p>
<p>▲Lotus Petals: Take the petals of a white lotus flower that are newly opened and without blemishes. Mix them with egg white and flour, then fry them in hot oil until both sides are yellow. Add a little white sugar on top. They are fragrant, crispy, and delicious.</p>
<h3>The Empty Coffin Scheme</h3>
<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>There was a certain Mr. Zhang, a modern youth. He had studied in Shanghai and, after graduating, took a job in an agency in Tianjin. He then took his family north. His wife was also a modern woman. The couple lived in a rented house in Tianjin and enjoyed all the pleasures of a modern family. Zhang, after losing his wife, experienced the pain of being a widower. Later, he received a telegram from his wife's family, instructing him to transport the coffin back to the South. However, Zhang's income in Tianjin was not high. During their life together, he and his wife could barely make ends meet. Transporting the coffin south from Tianjin would cost no less than a thousand yuan. He was unfamiliar with the area and had no way to raise such a large sum of money. Therefore, he decided to cremate his beloved wife. Using the latest electric cremation method, the body was reduced to ashes in fifteen minutes and placed in a tin box. He planned to take the box south. However, his wife's family had old-fashioned ideas. If he mentioned cremation, they would definitely object. Later, they repeatedly sent telegrams urging Zhang to transport the coffin back. Zhang was helpless. Moreover, they were relatives, and he feared hurting their feelings. Therefore, he devised an empty coffin scheme. In advance, he took the tin box south. After arriving in Shanghai, he bought an empty coffin and placed the tin box and his wife's favorite belongings in it. He deposited it in the funeral parlor of a certain public office. Then, he reported to his wife's family that the coffin had been transported back and was deposited in the funeral parlor. Upon hearing the news, his wife's family went to the public office to pay their respects. His mother-in-law even hugged the coffin and cried bitterly, unable to contain her grief. She did not know that the coffin was empty, containing only a box of ashes.</p>
<h3>Terrible Flood</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>In these past few years, the Chinese people have suffered all kinds of disasters, such as war, drought, banditry, and countless others. The afflicted areas often spanned several vast provinces, and the periods of suffering often stretched for years. The number of deaths was uncountable, and even now, it has not ended. The people in the disaster areas still do not know when they will be able to escape from the fires and waters and find peace. Unexpectedly, a new kind of flood, unprecedented and affecting an even wider area, has begun to wreak havoc. The extent of the damage in the future cannot yet be predicted. The hearts of people everywhere are filled with indescribable panic. Alas, Heaven is merciless to this extent; what else can be said? If you ask how vast the disaster area is, then it can be said that there is no place, north, south, east, or west, that is not likely to be affected. Both the northern and southern capitals, the old and new, have shown signs of disaster. After a heavy thunderstorm on the first day of this month in Beiping, the electricity and telephone lines were all blown down. The whole city was pitch black, and three people were struck and killed by lightning. Countless houses were destroyed. The water on the streets was ankle-deep, a vast expanse of water, turning the city into a swamp. The Yongding River rose sharply by twenty feet, exceeding ground level by five feet. The water was only about a foot away from the top of the embankment, and there was a risk of collapse at any moment. Deputy Commander Zhang Xueliang specially ordered engineers to camp on the embankment to guard against it day and night. The surrounding farmland has also turned into a vast expanse of water. Even if there is no more heavy rain, the Yongding River will remain intact, but the autumn harvest is hopeless. In Nanjing, there has also been torrential rain in the past week. Water accumulated on the streets, reaching shin-deep. Many other places are also suffering from flooding, showing signs of becoming a disaster. Taking these two capitals, old and new, as examples, one can imagine the rest. Yesterday, I met a friend from Gaoyou, and only then did I learn that the floods in the northern Jiangsu area were particularly severe. When this friend left Gaoyou, most of the people's homes had already been flooded. More than a thousand houses had collapsed from being submerged. The Grand Canal rose sharply to fourteen feet. People were in a state of panic day and night, not even having time to sleep or eat. Because to the west of the Grand Canal, separated only by an embankment, is West Lake, which is over four hundred li long and connects to Hongze Lake in the north. If there is more heavy rain, the embankment will not be reliable. Once the embankment breaks, all the land in Gaoyou County will be connected to West Lake. All the people are in danger of being buried in the bellies of fish. Shanghai has had several consecutive days of heavy rain. I don't know what the situation is like in Gaoyou now. My hometown is certainly also a concern. Half a month ago, the newspaper reported that the Baojia Dam almost collapsed. I have also heard people say that there is water on the city walls as well. Then, the flooding of the surrounding farmland is self-evident. Moreover, the steamer to Zhenjiang has been suspended for many days. News is cut off, so I can't even receive letters from home. I don't know what the extent of the disaster is. As the saying goes, "water and fire are merciless." But the disaster of water has great universality. A fire only affects one place, so how can they be compared? Alas, a terrible flood.</p>

He especially immersed himself deeply in painting flowers, adhering to a style that is both vigorous and graceful. Later, he traveled to Shanghai with his uncle, Mr. Xuehou, and resided at 16 Dongpushi Road in the French Concession. Many seek his art there.</p>
<h3>Travel Notes from India (67)</h3>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>On the morning of March 1st, a student named Krishna, about sixteen years old, invited me to visit the Golden Temple of Hinduism. It is a famous temple in Varanasi. For several days, he urged me to go, saying that I must go to see the essence of Hinduism. We walked there, about three li. We passed through narrow alleys, with many twists and turns, where carriages and horses could not pass. Gradually, I saw many old philosophers with their faces painted in various colors coming out of the alleys. I knew that we were not far from the Golden Temple. There were many poor people begging for money. If you gave money to one, they would surround you, so I dared not give any. At the entrance to a narrow alley, I suddenly saw a large, gray-white creature with two horns on its head coming out of the alley. Everyone touched their foreheads with their hands and said, "This is a divine creature." I looked at it and saw that it was a gray-white cow. I respectfully made way and let the sacred cow pass. There was also a small sacred cow following it. The alley was narrow, and the body of a sacred cow blocked the way, leaving no room for pedestrians. There were many men and women, and it was very crowded. The ground was covered with mud and flowers. Suddenly, someone stopped me and asked, "Who is this person? Can he enter the Hindu temple?" The student said, "This is a Chinese Buddhist." He sprinkled water on my head, and then I was allowed to pass. Everyone who passes must have water sprinkled on them. We went further to the temple gate. I had to take off my shoes. I saw a well with various kinds of flowers scattered in it. There were people selling flowers. You had to have flower water sprinkled on your head before you could enter. There was also a gatekeeper who would not allow me to enter. He saw that the hat I was wearing was Western-style and said that I was a Christian. The student explained for a long time before I was allowed to enter. It is said that even Hindus from distant lands are sometimes not allowed to enter. Its sacredness is so difficult to behold. I held flowers and entered barefoot with the crowd. The ground was muddy. In the temple, I only saw many people crowding around a flower water altar. In the center of the water was a yin-yang stone, which is the sacred object I described earlier, depicting the sexual union of male and female organs. The crowd surrounded it and received baptism. However, all four walls of the room were hung with mirrors, reflecting countless people receiving baptism here. I knew that there was a method in hypnotism called the full-room mirror hypnosis method. Entering it, there were too many people, and I couldn't squeeze through. The people's clothes were all unclean. I was very afraid of being crowded, but the guide insisted on letting me receive the grace of the flower water. He dragged me and squeezed me up. I wanted to laugh but couldn't. Soon I came out. This was receiving the baptism of the Golden Temple. I had previously participated in Muslim worship with Muslims. This time, I participated in the baptism of the Hindu yin-yang religion. I am simply studying limitless methods. Playing with the rituals of life, there are limitless beings. How dare I criticize them severely?</p>
<p>About a li away from the Golden Temple, I reached the banks of the Ganges River. The morning sun rose in the east, and the river water was clear. The scenery was very beautiful, unlike the turbid Ganges in Calcutta. However, men and women were still bathing in the muddy water, seeking liberation. This water was clear and rippled, with small boats swaying back and forth. Suddenly, a large head emerged from the waves, shaped like a human head. I asked in surprise what it was. They said, "It's a big fish." I asked if anyone fished here. They answered that no one eats fish in this sacred city. The big fish also do not eat people. After passing this place, in other places, Muslims fish and eat fish. The big fish also eat people. Here, the big fish are allowed to come and go freely and do not harm people. I seemed to believe the student's words, which made sense. It was similar to what a certain professor said yesterday, that Gandhi mourned for people who killed tigers and snakes. It is the principle of cause and effect. If two do not harm each other, then they forget each other. The people of Xuzhou in the north like to eat dog meat, so dogs often eat dead people. The elders in my hometown say that the people of Jiangnan do not eat dog meat, so when coffins are left in the wild for a long time, dogs do not eat the dead. The elders say that this is so. I think it is the same principle as the one the child discussed, that the people of Varanasi do not eat fish, and the fish do not eat people. I am not yet fully convinced of this because I have the principles of science in my mind. I also half believe in this scientific cause-and-effect talk of religion.</p>
<p>The Rotary Club Storytelling</p>
<h3>??? (31)</h3>
<p>— Xu Zhuodai</p>
<p>"You can't? You can't catch bedbugs, so you can be my husband?"</p>
<p>"What a joke! Does your husband have to be able to catch bedbugs?"</p>
<p>"It's not just my husband, anyone who can't catch bedbugs is not fit to be anyone's husband!"</p>
<p>Ziliang was extremely angry, he stood there and did not go to catch them.</p>
<p>"Then, when our father-in-law and mother-in-law choose a son-in-law, why not first hold a bedbug-catching contest, see who catches the most, and marry their daughter to him?"</p>
<p>"This is not my creation. I heard that there is a yarn factory in Hangzhou where the workers were complaining about bedbugs in the dormitory, so the manager suddenly issued an order saying that all staff, large and small, and even the workers, who could not catch bedbugs would be suspended from work. Sure enough, as soon as this order was issued, everyone worked hard to catch them, and before long, they completely eradicated the bedbugs. Several people who really couldn't catch them were fired at the end of the month. Someone went to plead for them, but the manager said: 'If a person can't even catch bedbugs, what else can they do? Are they fit to be workers?' Judging from the manager's words, it can be seen that catching bedbugs is a very easy task in life, so you, as a husband, must also be able to do it. If you can't, you can also be suspended from work!"</p>
<p>After saying that, she laughed again.</p>
<p>"This is what the manager said to the workers, not what a woman said to her husband."</p>
<p>"A husband is also a kind of worker!"</p>
<p>Ziliang knew that the more he said, the more wrong it would be, so he might as well go and catch some, just to get by. He first lit a candle, walked to the bed, opened the pillow, and luckily for Ziliang, he saw a big bedbug scurrying there.</p>

<h3>Financial Gold Market Storm Rises Suddenly</h3>
<p>▲ A Difference of Twenty-Three Taels in Half a Day: Yesterday, the 23rd, the Gold Exchange held a memorial service for the tragic incident involving overseas Chinese in Korea, so it was closed for half a day in the morning. When business resumed as usual in the afternoon, the gold price rose and fell repeatedly, changing drastically. The wild storm could not be contained. From noon to evening, there was a difference of twenty-three taels. People were panicked. In the end, it fell by more than six taels. It seems that the silver market fell, and American stocks also declined, so the gold price immediately soared, suddenly exceeding the 750-tael mark. Buyers were quite strong. Afterwards, it was suddenly heard that Germany was borrowing money from the United States, which was hopeful, and buying silver to mint silver coins to supplement the financial system. People were immediately terrified. Many large bullish traders tended to sell. Then, the exchange rate also weakened, and a big wave arose, plummeting twenty taels, giving the impression that the sky was shaking. It finally reached 732 or 33 taels. Afterwards, buyers seemed to become active, and a peaceful atmosphere returned.</p>
<p>▲ Unofficial Trading Before Noon: From before noon, a small number of colleagues had been trading unofficially outside the exchange, with prices ranging from 751 or 52 taels to 55 taels, then back to 51 or 52 taels. The big news had not yet changed. The silver price fell by a small eighth, and private telegrams also fell by a sixteenth, so people's hearts were high. However, the exchange rate quotation did not change, only adding 25 to the Japanese gold price.</p>
<p>▲ The Opening Price in the Afternoon Jumped More Than Eight Taels: The official opening price in the afternoon was 54 taels and 5 qian, which was 8 taels and 2 qian higher than yesterday's closing price. Next was 55 taels and 2 qian. Dalian Trading Company and exchange rate arbitrage firms were buying. It seems that British gold could be settled at 125 to 0625. Soon after, Yuancheng, Tong Taichang, Yingfenghang, etc. sold, falling back by more than four taels. At 2:10 pm, it was 50 taels and 05 qian, and British gold could be settled at 125. Soon after, Mitsui ate 125 to 1875. Banks traded interbank transactions for this month at 125 to 2:30 pm at 52 and a half taels.</p>
<p>▲ Hopes for German Debt, a Plunge of Twenty Taels: Afterwards, a storm suddenly arose. Rumors spread that German debt had been settled and that they wanted to buy silver. Large traders such as Bingxing, Yuanxingyong, Qianchangxiang, and speculators sold one after another. Bullish traders were eager to get rid of their holdings. Bearish traders worked hard to add to their positions. Also, goods were also being sold off. Consequently, the price broke through 50 taels and continued to fall, seemingly unstoppable. In a moment, it plummeted another ten taels or more. The price of British gold was being sold by colleagues to various banks at prices as low as 3125 to 375. Therefore, at 3 pm, it was finally 32 taels. Dalian gangs and others took advantage of this to chase the price, and it was heard that HSBC was eating 3125, so it pulled up another seven or eight taels to 40 taels. However, the selling wind did not stop and remained weak. It fell by more than five taels. At 3:30 pm, it was 30 and a half taels.</p>
<p>▲ Evening Recovery, Still Up Six Taels and Seven Qians: From 4 pm, it recovered and rose again. Buyers were strong again. Yuan Maoyong, Wanxing, Tong Taichang, etc. pulled in a lot, and the price was raised by six taels. Near the close, it was 40 taels and 05 qian. At 4:30 pm, the closing price was 39 and a half taels, then it rose another three taels, to more than 42 taels to three taels. Compared to the day before (according to the listed price), it still fell by six taels and seven qian. The maximum price in half a day was 55 taels and 2 qian, and the minimum price was 32 taels, a swing of 23 taels and 2 qian. The volatility of the market made people feel at a loss.</p>
<p>▲ Raw Silver Adds Only Ten Taels and Two Qians and Five Lis: The opening price for goods was 54 taels and 5 qian, and the closing price was 40 taels and 05 qian. The listed price was changed to 792 taels and 6 qian, subtracting 40 to 60 taels, then back to 52 or 3 taels. The book price was 38 to 40 taels. Supplementary water was 38 taels. The raw silver seemed to be softening, adding only ten taels and two qians and five lis. Yingfenghang sold more than 1,000 taels to Tianjin and Dalian gangs because those gangs, seeing the sharp drop in the gold price, thought the raw silver was small and profitable, so they immediately acted. Also, Hankou gangs and silver shops sold several hundred taels to Yingfenghang at a price of ten taels and two qians and five lis.</p>
<p>▲ Chaotic Market, Difficult to Investigate In and Out: As for the transactions of various firms on the trading floor, they were extremely complicated and the volume was quite high. Because the market was extremely chaotic and the changes were dramatic, it was difficult to investigate. However, according to statistics, Yuan Maoyong, Wanxing, Tong Taichang, Shunli, etc. were all buying positions. Bingxing, Yuanxingyong, Yuantai, Yu Da, and goods were all selling. Qianchangxiang, Zhifenghang, Cuichangyong, Yuanheng, Futaiheng, Yuanchun, Yuankangxiang, Longsheng, Yuhe, etc. were in and out in a very complicated manner. Also, those who specialized in exchange rate arbitrage came in and out repeatedly. The Dalian gangs bought a total of more than 7,000, sold more than 1,000, and the Guangdong gangs had few transactions.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Turns Tight to Loose</h3>
<p>▲ Chinese Merchants Rise and Fall in the Front Market</p>
<p>Yesterday, the British and American silver markets were still flat. British silver did not change, and American silver fell slightly. Also, the exchange rate saw a small drop.

Eastern Exchange added 25, totaling one tael, six qian, four fen and a half. All others were unchanged.

As for the gold market, it was only half a day in the afternoon, but the storm was very big, rising and falling, and finally trending down.

British gold traded for about 400,000 pounds, mostly arbitrage. Also, American gold was not very active. Japanese gold was being sold heavily by the Dalian gangs, with Dalian bills of 1 million yuan to buy gold. It seems that the German debt issue was being discussed in London, and rumors were optimistic, fearing that the silver market might rise, so the market turned from tight to loose yesterday.</p>

<h3>Securities: Yesterday's Bond Market Only Opened One Afternoon Session</h3>
<p>▲ Slightly Reduced Price, Quiet Market:</p>
<p>Yesterday, the stock exchange closed for half a day in the morning to mourn the massacre of Korean residents. In the afternoon, only one session opened, and the market was quite idle. The total futures volume was more than 6.2 million, and the spot volume was only 6,000 yuan. Regarding the trend of various bond prices, the market was still quiet, and the bond market was as dull as before. Therefore, the balance between supply and demand was maintained, and bond prices became increasingly stagnant. Prices only fluctuated by a few corners. Compared to the previous day, when supply exceeded demand, there was a general trend of fatigue, but it was very slight, only about one or two corners to one yuan. It was found that bond prices had been very chaotic in recent days, trapped in a spinning state, with a rare turnaround. In the near term, unless affected by other important reasons, it is feared that there will be no significant rise or fall.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Market Hit by Rumors</h3>
<p>The yarn market was closed for half a day in the morning to mourn the deceased overseas Chinese. When the market opened in the afternoon, the sales of spot yarn were increasingly smooth. The work of inspecting inferior goods had been implemented, and most places could not pass it. Therefore, the price of local yarn increased, while the price of Japanese yarn fell. As a result, some people had a very strong bullish mindset. However, a certain major firm still kept selling non-stop, and the market pressure was still heavy. The market was particularly badly hit by the rumors of the current situation and the fall in the gold price. However, Rongxing bought 6,000-7,000 bales, and the future situation was difficult to predict.</p>
<p>▲ Human Standard Suddenly Falls with Gold Price: The exchange's human standard opened in the afternoon. The market atmosphere was strong, and the price increased dramatically in each month by one tael. Then, in the second or third session, it suddenly turned down due to the sharp fall in the gold market and various rumors. In the end, the near month fell by 2 qian, and the far month rose by 2 qian. The transaction volume was 40,750 bales. It was found that Yuda had 1,300 bales, Senkang had 850 bales, Ruida had 2,400 bales, Yichang had 1,050 bales, and Dachang had 1,450 bales. The purchases included Mingde's 750 bales, Rongxing's 6,850 bales, Yongfeng's 650 bales, and Yuantai's 650 bales. The closing price of the human standard is recorded below:</p>
<p>| Human Standard Closing Price | Increase/Decrease | Account Balance |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| July 164.0 | 21,600 |</p>
<p>| October 163.9 | Up 2 | 90,800 |</p>
<p>| August 164.9 | Down 2 | 77,600 |</p>
<p>| November 164.5 | 81,000 |</p>
<p>| September 162.9 | 2 | 95,000 |</p>
<p>| December 165.2 | 2 | 64,900 |</p>
<p>▲ Spot Yarn Customer Sales of 3,000 Bales: The sales of spot yarn were still smooth. According to statistics, various gangs bought a total of 3,000 bales, and colleagues bought 900 bales. The local yarn price increased step by step. Customers from Guangdong imported 800 bales, Qingdao imported 750 bales, the interior imported 450 bales, the northern gang imported 160 bales, Shantou imported 100 bales, and miscellaneous gangs imported 350 bales.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Boosted by Rain</h3>
<p>The cotton market initially rose then fell. The situation in overseas Indian and American cotton markets consistently favors the downstream. Due to continuous rainfall in this port, there are concerns about floods affecting the new cotton. People's sentiment is firm, and many retail investors are buying to go long. However, with gold prices weakening, spot cotton business is quiet. Some who hold goods are said to be continuously short selling.</p>
<p>▲ Han Standard Initially Rises Then Falls.  The Exchange's Han Standard opened sharply in the afternoon, with each month rising by five, six, or seven "qian". Due to the large drop in gold prices during the second and third sessions, market activity was also small. As a result, each month rose by five "fen" to one and a half "qian". The total transaction volume was 114,800 "dan". Sold by He Shen 2,300 "dan", Yu Da 2,000 "dan", Gong Tai 3,600 "dan", Geng Feng 3,500 "dan", Heng De 2,300 "dan", Xin Cheng 2,000 "dan", Xin Heng 3,900 "dan", Jin Feng 3,500 "dan".

<h3>Foreign Yarn and Flower Prices Fall Sharply</h3>

<h3>Grains - Rice Prices Rise Daily Due to Rain</h3>
<p>▲ Xin Zha.  Yesterday, inland goods arrived, including about ten ships from Changshu, Wuxi, Kunshan, Danyang, Chonggu, Qingpu, Xitang, etc.  Threshing was suspended in the morning due to heavy rain. By the afternoon, five firms including Tongxinggong, Wanshengtai, Ruichang, Hefengtai, and Dachang traded over a thousand "dan" of northern japonica and thin rice. The situation was nearly one "chi" higher than the previous market. The rest of the goods had no transactions. According to letters from the west, the market price of coarse japonica is increasing, so it is difficult for the port situation to fall back.</p>
<p>▲ Nantou.  Few sources from various gangs, and weak inventory in the docks. City and rural store sales depend on the weather and light rain. Moreover, there are rumors of flooding upstream, and people's sentiment is even firmer. The market price of thick japonica is high, and the expected price has increased by another "jiao". However, the middle segment has been slightly lifted. The supply of thin rice delivered to Ji Ling Ning Wei and local street markets is truly insufficient for distribution. The market price has increased by another two or three "jiao". The sales of Lu Yang Jian are evenly split, with no significant gains or losses. The arrival of foreign rice is still lacking, and customers are slightly taking it, resulting in a step-by-step tightening of prices.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea - European Firms Seize the Opportunity to Replenish Stock</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai foreign firm silk market saw no movement in actual sales. Only European firms took the opportunity to replenish missing goods such as yellow and white factory silk due to the stabilization of foreign exchange rates. There were still no telegrams from overseas silk markets turning towards Shanghai. Yesterday, only Liana and others shipped 30 bales of white factory silk to Shanghai, Dachang and others shipped 25 bales of yellow factory silk, and Anli shipped 10 bales of white dried silk. Prices were all firm.</p>
<h3>Eighty Pieces of New Wuxi Factory Silk Shipped to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Since the listing of new cocoons, various silk factories in Wuxi have successively started reeling. The futures trading of new cocoon silk in Shanghai this month has not been weak. With the end of the month approaching for delivery, silks were packed and shipped to Shanghai. Yesterday afternoon, the Shanghai-Wuxi passenger train transported 80 pieces of new factory silk of brands such as Golden Twin Eagles and Golden Twin Deer to prepare for delivery to the silk inspection office for inspection of the filaments, and then delivered to various foreign firms on schedule.</p>
<h3>Green Tea Trading Flourishes</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the Shanghai foreign firm tea market, the interest in green tea from various roads such as Lu Zhuang, Tu Zhuang, and Pingshui roads by British and French firms was increasingly strong, and trading was quite prosperous. Among them, items such as Needle Eyebrow and Show Eyebrow saw market prices surge by four or five taels. The momentum of goods such as Shrimp Eye Phoenix Eyebrow and large gangs was also trending firm. Although the destination of Treasure Eyebrow was more active than before, it was difficult to stabilize the selling price due to abundant stock in the hands of the people. As for Buy Xi, the market was completely stagnant.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market - Dutch Sugar Throws 2,000 Tons Open Fiercely</h3>
<p>▲ Top Ice White Price Opens at Fourteen Taels and Two Qian.</p>
<p>Yesterday, sugar market production area telegrams reported that Cuban spot sugar prices remained unchanged, and New York sugar futures for all months rose by one to four points. Java spot and futures sugar remained unchanged. The Association market opening was quite firm, but demand was low, so transactions were sparse. Dutch 24-grade coarse grain white sugar:</p>
<p>White and Hong Kong goods traded at prices from eleven taels four qian two and a half fen to four qian five fen. 20-grade medium grain white sugar at ten taels nine qian five fen to eleven taels. The market form was firm and elegant. Taikoo car sugar HM mark at eleven taels four qian, the trend was still firm, B mark at twelve taels one qian, CW mark at eleven taels nine qian, DY mark at eleven taels eight qian, the market was relatively flat. The throwing of Dutch sugar was quite popular. Yuan Tong, Chi Pan, and Xin also opened 1,100 tons, with the same price. Nan Shenglong opened 300 tons of coarse grain white sugar for August and September, priced at 5 yuan and 9 jiao and a half. Yuan Ji sold 300 tons of 16-grade medium grain white sugar, priced at 5 yuan and 5 jiao, which is a tax of 2 yuan and 4 jiao per "dan" for Kena, so key players are still bold, and the market outlook is promising. Some domestic goods merchants opened dozens of packages of full ice white sugar, priced at fourteen taels two qian, with slightly higher asking prices of fourteen taels five qian, but there were no inquiries. Shang Hu red sugar opened at eleven taels four qian and a half, and Nan Qing at eight taels six qian, and each also saw sales, and the market form was not weak.</p>
<h3>Hardware - American Tinplate Sales Gradually Become Active</h3>
<p>Hardware trading was quite quiet yesterday due to the weather and the commemoration of the compatriots who were killed, and various fixed businesses only had half a day of trading. Because of this, various gangs stopped handling eastern tinplate, so they all switched to handling American tinplate, causing the trading of this commodity to be slightly more robust than before. The market price has taken on a momentum of rising sharply. Forty-eight sheets are estimated at 19 taels 2 qian and a half per dan, 28-gauge is sold at 20 taels, 26-gauge at 18 taels 7 qian and a half, and 24-gauge at 18 taels. It is found that various gangs opened a total of three or four hundred "dan".

<h3>Haste Makes Waste</h3>
<p>—Du Mei</p>
<p>"Haste makes waste," "A fine net catches no fish," all similar aphoristic idioms, I have gradually come to believe now. This is not for any special reason, but simply because I am getting older and have more experience, which naturally gives me more insights. I don't feel happy about it; I only feel that my childlike innocence is gradually disappearing. The life of simply enjoying the shade under a big tree has been implicitly declared bankrupt. Although I don't need to weather any great storms or resist any huge waves, I still need to take care of things within a certain range. Alas, the days of playing all day, when the oil bottle falling over was none of my business, I'm afraid I can only dream of now. The scenes before the age of sixteen constantly ripple in my mind, but youth and innocence are constantly repelling each other, going in opposite directions. Detestable youth increases relentlessly, second by second, while the precious "innocence" is invisibly eroded and destroyed by it. What can't be pushed away is youth, but what can't be kept is innocence, alas, where has it disappeared to?</p>
<p>My sister's marriage is a very good example. Although her husband's family is one of the best in the area, she is already the mother of two children after four or five years. Those adorable babies, alas, are the main reason for the disappearance of her youth. And when I think of our mother, raising the seven of us sisters, even if a person is cast from iron, they would have to be polished bright, right? Not to mention anything else, even I, as an older sister, have been worried and tired for a ten-year-old younger sister, starting from the recent past. Now, I am also taking on the responsibility of caring for my younger brother.</p>
<p>My younger sister was brought here by me in the first month of this year to attend school. Because she was too young and away from her loving mother's embrace for the first time, and most importantly, she didn't understand the local language. She didn't understand others, and others didn't understand her even more. She not only spoke a pure local dialect but also mixed in many colloquialisms that young children have but adults rarely use. In this situation, living at school was impossible, so she lived in my dormitory. Every day, I had to take her to the attached elementary school of the Patriotic Girls' School near my school. Fortunately, Patriotic Girls' School is my alma mater, so there was still a place to take care of her. But for the past six months, I have taken care of her daily life, whether she was hungry or cold, especially when she was sick not long after arriving. The food was too bad, and she wasn't used to eating it, leaving me at a loss. At that time, I felt like I had been startled and thought about the hardship my mother endured raising me and the others, from babies of eight inches to growing up so big, and then educating us. What a tremendous labor that is! Then I made a new resolution: my mother's kindness should be repaid one by one. Alas, great and benevolent mothers of the world, your contribution to humanity is so exquisite and outstanding!</p>
<p>Recently, although my younger sister has returned, my younger brother has come. I can say that I have transplanted the heart of caring for my younger sister onto him. He can't eat the local food very well. Within the realm of what is possible, I always have to find a way to make him eat. Fine, as a result, I have to eat lunch before I can go out. In the afternoon, I have to rush back to school before six o'clock; otherwise, I will be uneasy. The time I spend outside, especially when I tell him to wait for me but cannot get back on time, makes me even more anxious. Yesterday was like this: "Brother, I'm going out. Be sure to wait for me to come back for dinner." "Okay, I'll wait for you."</p>
<p>It was also to finish writing a manuscript, so I was so engrossed that I didn't care that I had spent too much time. The boarder had already sent the food. Friends asked me to eat before leaving, but how could I? I hurriedly gathered my papers, umbrella, grabbed them, and ran. While changing cars, I bought some snacks, which inevitably delayed me a little. When I got to the North Station, I was hungry and didn't care to look to see if it was Route 3 or Route 1 public bus. I hurriedly jumped on, bought a ticket, and felt a little relieved. In less than a quarter of an hour, I would be able to get to school. It wasn't too late at six-thirty. While my chaotic thoughts had not yet settled down, the ticket inspector came to check my ticket, interrupting my mixed thoughts. The bus gradually turned westward. I knew things were a little bad. It was going to go back to the factory to add "Vaseline," which would delay me a few more minutes. This again caused the impatience and anxiety that had just been interrupted.</p>
<p>"Hey, Miss Jin, are you going to Zhenru?"</p>
<p>"No, back to school." The voice was familiar to me. Without looking up, I determined that it was Mr. Xu, who works in the bus company. I casually responded to him like this.</p>
<p>"Oh, you're wrong. How did you get on Route 3? I thought you were going to Zhenru."</p>
<p>"Oh, I wasn't paying attention. This is really absurd. I've never been this confused before. I was so anxious that I got confused. I'm glad you saw me." I felt extremely ashamed, and anxiety and irritability intensified, pressing in on my mind. At this time, I was extremely resentful. Why was I so careless? Even if people don't laugh at me for being illiterate, they'll laugh at me for being too careless.</p>
<p>"Okay, it doesn't matter. Please stay on this bus, get off outside the factory, and transfer again." Mr. Xu and the familiar ticket collector, seeing my anxious and remorseful expression, both said this to me, as if containing a tone of comfort. And the ticket collector also said to Mr. Xu, "You put her on the bus and tell the ticket seller that this ticket is valid."</p>
<p>In this process, of course, I had already switched to a different route bus. Mr. Xu waited with me on Qiujiang Road for a long time before seeing a bus come that was marked "1," but it was going to Zhenru. So, we waited again. Luckily, not a moment later, another "1" came, but it wasn't going to Jiangwan. It was marked "Entering Factory" below, and there were no passengers inside. As a result, a total of four buses passed by. At five minutes per bus, five times four is twenty minutes that had passed. Besides the first bus that went to the factory to add "Vaseline," I also had to switch to another bus. By calculation, it was certainly more than twenty minutes. I kept waiting until the fifth bus went. Who knew it would go to the factory again? This time it wasn't to "add Vaseline," but to replace a new horn. At the same time, the drivers and ticket sellers were laughing and joking with each other. But how could they know that I, as a passenger, was burning with anxiety?</p>
<p>When I returned to school, it was already 7:45, a total loss of forty minutes. I then deeply felt that "haste makes waste" and "a fine net will never catch fish," which invisibly gave me a lesson.</p>
<h3>Ms. Wu Wenjing</h3>
<p>— Bing She</p>
<h3>Daughter of the Gatekeeper</h3>
<p>— Yu Xi</p>
<p>The gatekeeper of our school is a tall Northerner, surnamed Cai. People all call him Old Cai, because he is a bit old, but his spirit is still that of a young man. His face is ruddy, and a kind smile is always hanging at the corners of his eyes. His mature and prudent attitude is admirable.</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>He came to work as a gatekeeper at the beginning of our school's founding. During this time, the school has gone through many vicissitudes, and the principals have been replaced many times. The students are transformed every year, the old go and the new come, like travelers. Even the teachers, there is not one who taught at our school twenty years ago and is still at our school. Only him, the gatekeeper, has never been transferred. His history as the gatekeeper of our school is as long as the school's life history. He is our authority on the past. Sometimes when he talks to students or anyone about the various situations of the school in the past, he is as enthusiastic as an eighty- or ninety-year-old man telling children about the "Longhairs" (Taiping rebels).</p>
<p>His salary is the highest among the school workers. The students also have a good impression of him. At the end of each semester, some would give him one or two dollars as a reward for delivering letters. After working diligently and frugally for many years, he must have quite a bit of savings. It is said that among all the school workers and the shopkeepers at the school gate, he is the wealthiest.</p>
<p>Everyone believes this.</p>
<p>But according to reliable investigation, the wealthiest among the school workers is Old Wang, the dormitory tea server, followed by the local errand runner surnamed Li. Old Cai only ranks third. Saying he is the richest is actually wronging him. But even if you wrong him, he doesn't get angry. He just smiles and says slowly, "Haha, everyone hopes so. It's just that things don't go as planned."</p>
<p>Sometimes he would then sigh, "These years, just the expenses of oil, salt, firewood, and rice at home are enough to make people struggle."</p>
<p>His home is at the school gate, consisting of three rooms in a one-story house. In front of the house, there is a candy store selling snacks and daily necessities. The business is quite good, but according to Old Cai himself, doing business with students is really difficult. If you don't give credit, the business is small. If you give credit, it's really exhausting to collect the debts. And no matter how tight you are, there will always be some losses in the accounts every year. "So for a store like mine," he said, "I am already very satisfied if I can make ends meet every year."</p>
<p>This is the truth. The students of our school come from all directions: Sichuan, Guangdong, the Northeast, and even overseas Chinese. They don't care about the cost of food and drink, but they like to buy on credit. For example, they say,</p>
<p>"Hey, one bread and one cup of coffee, write it down." Or they say,</p>
<p>"Hey, those two bottles of soda, put it on my tab."</p>
<p>At this time, who can say "No, you must pay now," or point to the red paper strip pasted on the wall that says "Thank you for your patronage, cash only"? Of course, you can only give them credit. Once you do, within half a year, they will unknowingly owe a lot of money. Some people, after owing money, won't think about paying until you ask them again and again. Or even if they do, they will postpone it to tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, or next week, until they can't postpone it any further. Then they will only pay you a few dollars and transfer a few dollars to the next account. Some even say they have no money to pay. When you encounter this kind of person, everyone wants to impound their luggage, which is a lot of trouble. In the end, it always ends up being handled carelessly...</p>
<p>At Old Cai's house, there are also his old wife and beloved daughter. The store also employs two assistants, making a total of five people eating. His daughter is studying at a nearby junior high school. That tuition fee is also something that our gatekeeper often calculates in his mind.</p>
<p>His daughter is only sixteen or seventeen years old. Because the place where she studies is close to home, she is a day student. She is very hardworking. According to several students in our school who are used to getting up early, every morning they can always hear her reading English aloud in her room. She reads for a while, then takes her schoolbag and goes to school. She doesn't come home until school is dismissed at four o'clock. After she comes home, she doesn't go out to play anywhere. She only helps her mother with chores such as washing clothes, washing rice, and washing vegetables. Sometimes she even sits in the store to help sell things and write accounts. If you don't see her in the store, and you don't see her on the river beach, then she must be in the bedroom doing math problems or practicing English composition.</p>
<p>She is petite, her face is also well-proportioned, and she is smart and lively. Therefore, the students of our school often like to use buying things as an excuse to get a chance to chat with her. This naive girl does not show any unwillingness. She talks to them, and sometimes she even asks them to explain the difficulties in her homework. At this time, the person being asked, regardless of whether he is an expert or a layman in this subject, cannot but readily agree to her request...</p>
<p>There are quite a few students in our school who act as her volunteer teachers.</p>
<p>This summer, she graduated from junior high school. She was first in her graduating class. This time, our school is enrolling students for the first time, and she came to apply for the first year of preparatory class. After reviewing the results, her ranking was also at the top. When her father saw his daughter's name on the list of newly admitted students to our school, he was overjoyed. He often said,</p>
<p>"This is with the help of the teachers." But how could he not have expected that his daughter would definitely be admitted? He has infinite hope for his daughter. He is willing to bear any burden for her to study and for her to seek happiness.</p>
<p>And Miss Cai is also giving her father a lot of glory. Not only is she good at her studies, but she has also shown her skills on the basketball court. In the junior high school she recently graduated from, she was the captain of the women's basketball team. Half a year ago, their women's team played against our school's women's team on our school's basketball court. At that time, she was playing defense.</p>
<p>We are glad that our school will have another female basketball player in the second half of the year...</p>
<p>When we occasionally talked about Miss Cai's admission to our school, someone joked, "Her father is a gatekeeper, so everything is cheap. The only thing she suffers from is that she can't exchange love letters with boys, haha."</p>

<h3>Britain Building the Largest Seaplane, Germany Dominates Land Planes with Superior Strength</h3>
<p>— Jun Shan</p>
<p>To use an exaggerated phrase of the British, they rule the waves of the sea. This originally referred to ships, but since the rise of seaplanes, the proud British have refused to let anyone else seize the hegemony. Therefore, they are now building the world's largest seaplane, which is already under construction in South New Port.</p>
<p>This plane, once completed, will not only be the largest plane in the world, but also one of the most luxurious and prosperous. Although its shape and size are similar to Germany's largest DO-X, it can carry more passengers, has a higher speed, and is much more comfortable and luxurious. The name of this plane has not yet been announced. It is only known that it is being built by the Vickers company and is equipped with Rolls-Royce "Buzzard"</p>
<p>motors.</p>
<p>Its horsepower is equal to that of the Do-X, but it uses only six engines, while the Do-X uses twelve. Each engine has 1,000 horsepower and is installed in four seats on the plane's monoplane wing. The maximum speed can reach 145 miles per hour, and the normal speed is 120 miles per hour. This plane can carry forty passengers plus seven crew members. Passengers are not crammed together like most commercial planes. It is almost as comfortable as an American first-class parlor car. Each passenger has a spacious berth and a private room. The meals are also excellent, and there is a lookout room available.</p>
<p>This plane was ordered by the British Air Ministry. Although its purpose has not yet been announced, it is guessed that it is intended to fly to various colonies. The matter of flying from England to India, after the R-101 airship had problems, is about to be carried out.</p>
<p>Although it is made entirely of pure steel, this seaplane is extremely light and agile. When fully loaded with passengers, it can only fly one thousand miles, but if it is not carrying passengers, it can fly across the Atlantic Ocean safely without landing.</p>
<p>At the same time, we can also turn to the aspect of land planes. Undoubtedly, Germany occupies an unparalleled advantage. The largest land plane currently in use is a Junkers of the German Lufthansa, carrying passengers between Berlin and London. That plane can carry twenty people, including the crew.</p>
<h3>The Life of Working Women in New York</h3>
<p>— Lin</p>
<p>(7) A Glimpse of Life</p>
<p>Mamie has forty-five minutes for lunch. On very busy days, she is only allowed half an hour. This situation usually happens during the sales period, or perhaps on a few Saturdays and Sundays. Mamie must go to the changing room at noon, put on her coat, and then run out to find a place to eat. Her store has a dining room for employees, but Mamie and her colleagues prefer to eat outside the store at noon. The store's dining room is better and the food is not expensive. Running outside the store, they can find more places to eat. Mamie thinks fifteen minutes is enough to eat. Most of the time at noon, Mamie runs to a drugstore, stands outside the soda fountain and eats some sandwiches and ice cream. She often finds French pastries delicious. She would like to replace sandwiches with exquisite pastries. An Italian noodle shop sells a plate of hot noodles and a cup of coffee for twenty-five cents. Delicious cheese is placed on the table for free consumption. As for the variety of food in the snack bar, it is even more diverse. Mamie often feels that when she runs to these places, she overspends her meal allowance, because those foods are really mouthwatering. When eating, the girls often eat together. Salesgirls and packers have completely different statuses. Only after graduating from packing is a sales book given to her. This is Mamie's hope. She wants to be a salesgirl. Their salary can be as high as twenty dollars a week, and sometimes the commission is as much as four dollars. To be a salesperson, she must be eighteen years old and have experience in the store, or be promoted from the store.</p>
<p>When eating, the girls talk about nothing but store matters, and occasionally about personal matters, such as clothing issues, boyfriends, and family disagreements. They don't dawdle much when eating.</p>
<p>After the meal, everyone hurries back to the store to spend the long afternoon. The girls prefer to be busy, so that time passes easily. When the store is crowded with customers, they cannot rush home. Of course, during Christmas, the crowds of customers are terrible. When the girls go back, they are really too tired to move. During the Christmas season, they only have half an hour to eat, and they work all day without rest. Sometimes they even work overtime. According to New York's newly revised labor laws for working women, they cannot work too much overtime except for a fixed amount of time.</p>
<p>Mamie pays one dollar from her salary every month as an insurance fund and medical fund. She feels very stingy about this money and feels that it is paid after being forced. Many girls think this way, although a few people understand the benefits of this system.</p>
<p>During work hours in the store, knowledge is increased. There are several classes taught in the store, but the courses are all related to store organization and product knowledge. Very little is said about culture.</p>
<p>After the closing bell rings, probably at twenty minutes to six, the girls hurriedly cover the merchandise and rush to get their bags. If there are still many customers at that time, the bell cannot be rung to close the door until five thirty.</p>
<p>Mamie goes home, retracing the old path. At this time, the subway car is always unbearably crowded. Everyone breathes in bad air, and you push me and I push you in endless noise. Finally, Mamie arrives at her station and struggles to get out of the door. How cool and lovely is the air on the street! She loves the hazy street lights, which shine straight into Mamie's heart.</p>
<p>Finally, she arrives home. A hot and intense smell rushes into her nose, but she is hungry. Her mother has done a lot of hard work at home. The rent is forty-two dollars a month. Her father's money is very unreliable. When the family's economic situation is difficult, her mother has to go out to do odd jobs. She registers at a home service agency, so that she can find something to do when she needs work. Mamie gives half of her small monthly salary to her mother, and she keeps the remaining six dollars for transportation, meals, and clothing. She cannot be extravagant at all.</p>
<p>"Here comes Mamie," the girl shouts, "Now we can eat."</p>
<p>They don't eat in a fixed way. Dad hasn't come home yet. When it's late, he chatters endlessly with people, so the family no longer waits for him. Mamie swallows her food in one gulp.</p>
<p>"Mamie, why are you in such a hurry?" Rose asks.</p>
<p>"I have a date."</p>
<p>"Who are you dating?" Connie wants to know.</p>
<p>"Oh, Bert," Mamie gently taps her sister's head and rushes back to the bedroom to change clothes.</p>
<p>Bert is very young, a clerk in a store. He arrives at Mamie's place at about a quarter past eight. Mamie hasn't finished dressing yet. The girls are very shy when they see young men. They don't dare to talk to him. Mrs. Rochester is in the kitchen and doesn't come out. Finally, Mamie appears. She has dressed up very hard, looking like a wax doll, with blood-red lips, a face covered with white powder, and a lot of rouge on her cheeks. Her eyebrows and eyelashes are as black as a crow's wings. In short, as far as Mamie is concerned, she has put a lot of thought into her makeup to cope with a night gathering. She is wearing a black and tight-fitting dress, which makes her look even thinner.</p>
<p>Mamie and Bert run to the "Poppy Tots Club" to dance. This venue is organized by a group of young people who are still wet behind the ears. Each person pays two dollars to cover all the expenses of the dance floor and a three-person band. There are probably two hundred young men and women in the entire venue, and everyone's circumstances are about the same.</p>
<p>The music starts, Mamie's legs move faintly, and her boyfriend also waves non-stop.</p>
<p>"Come on, girl," Bert says as he spins her on the floor. Although the music is loud, it is not very in tune, but there is a kind of enthusiasm. In this place, many starving children find happiness and relieve all their boredom. (To be continued)</p>
