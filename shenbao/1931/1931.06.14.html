<p>（南京）十三日晨第三屆中央執行委員會第五次全體會議常務委員會提出處理粤變及剿匪兩案如下、</p>
<p>（甲）報告處理廣東事變經過並請决定方針案、略稱本黨秉承總理遺敎、謀訓政之實施與完成、於五月五日、由國民政府召集國民會議於首都、制定約法、政府所提政治總報告案、剷除赤匪報告案、建設實施程序案、敎育方針等案、均經大會一致之決議、以一切執行決議案之責任、付於政府、五月十七日國民會議閉幕、六月一日國民政府公布約法、本當於此、方當極盡智慮、領導全國人民、一心一德、承和平奮鬭之遺訓、赴訓政建設之前途、不幸乃有少數同志、惑於流言、不念此匪終凶之戒、謀破和平統一之局、集會廣州、迷途罔反、中央一意斡旋、於茲逾月、溯粤事之始、爲古應芬等於四月三十日、突由廣州發表通電、對蔣同志中正、作背理蔑法之糾彈、其所摭拾、悉屬浮譌、蔣同志於五月一日、呈向中央監察委員會、自請查辦、中央監察委員會認爲古等卅電、摭拾浮言、不足損蔣同志之毫末、又以署名此電之人、未必全爲同意此電之人、應先詳細根問、俾白内容、因請蔡孑民張溥泉李石曾張靜江吳稚暉五同志、電致古等、糾其錯誤、一方力邀適在上海之孫科同志、共同勸告、維繫和平、不圖古等旣無反省之表示、孫科同志、入粤之後、復爲唐紹儀汪精衛陳濟棠等所誘惑、乃有五月二十五日唐紹儀領銜之電、嗣是以後、諸同志之在粤省、如陷重圍、益難自拔、雖經中央諸同志、海内外各級黨部、多方勸告、而一切惡化腐化份子、乘在粤諸同志一時之誤、紛集於廣州、舉行所謂非常會議、組織所謂國民政府矣、中央常務會議於此、認於此種反動集團之行動、已拂逆全國人民之意思、危害和平統一之基礎、妨礙剿滅赤匪之進行、乃於五月三十日中央執行委員會、對在粤諸同志、作肫誠之勸告、同時於六月一日、發表宣言、痛陳中國當前之大禍爲赤匪、政府唯一之責任爲剿匪、對於粤事、力主寬大、冀其覺悟、今蔣同志即日親自督師剿匪、黨國存亡、繫此一局、爲特略述經過情形、及中央始終維護和平專力剿匪之决心、提請大會討論、决議施行、</p>
<p>（乙）全國一致協力剿赤匪案、自第四次全體會議議决、以剷共刻匪、爲本年度施政綱要之首務、常務委員會、秉此旨督促國民政府、積極進行、數月之間、剿匪工作、日有進展、贛省爲匪患最熾區域、自經圍剿、其勢亦已日蹙、徒以匪情狡詐、裹脅民衆、憑藉險阻、出没靡常、必須妥定計劃、節節合圍、方能殲滅凈盡、永絶根株、最近國民會議集會首都、接受國民政府剿滅赤匪之報告、有極詳盡之决議、本黨以解救民困爲職責、自應殫精極慮、爲民族除此最大之禍患、常務委員會特以專一心力剿滅赤匪之義、昭告國人、縱有意外之橫逆、决不稍爲所挫阻、唯默察赤患所伏隱微普遍、不同平常癬疥之疾、苟非本黨同志、確認此事爲目前革命唯一工作、全體一致爲民前驅、各級政府通力一心、上下呼應、一洗曩往散漫旁觀之�</p>

<h3 id="c17">再論内田繼任滿鐵總裁事 <a href="#c17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>此次日本以内田康哉伯爵繼任滿鐵總裁。更有說焉近自中日鐵路會議之說起後。日人對於以滿鐵爲中心之滿蒙發展計劃。復大活動。在我東北之日僑。大倡所謂自主同盟。以保持帝國之權益。並發展日本在滿之民族。而在東京方面之元老派。則大倡經營滿鐵之獨立化。使滿鐵有議决方針之權。自主與獨立說遥相呼應。僑商與元老派交相策勵。目的爲急欲發展滿蒙。故反對幣原外相之軟弱外交。又恐政府外交軟弱。對滿鐵交涉讓步。故有此自主與獨立之運動。彼所謂自主與獨立。並非眞不受政府支配。不過欲使其政策。不隨政府之更迭而有所變更。其實意即欲以滿鐵機關。操緃經營滿蒙之大權也。日人之此種活動。已促起政府相當注意。故此次選擇繼任人物。頗爲鄭重。昨電通社謂。日政府以滿鐵關係重要。須具有外交手腕之大人物。方免向來隨内閣更迭爲轉移之弊。由是以觀。日政府固已容納自主獨立之主張矣。特未知此後之内田氏。果仍一秉向來之幣原政策。以辦滿鐵乎。抑從日人之强硬方針以辦滿鐵乎。此則與外交前途大有關係者也。。</p>

<p>内閣改組</p>
<p>興登堡總統不表贊同</p>
<p>預算虧短爲數甚鉅</p>
<p>市上外幣爭購一空</p>
<p>國民社十三日柏林電、德總理白魯寗往東普魯士進謁總統、報告赴英經過及國内政局情形後、今日返京聲稱、總統完全贊成内閣主張、不改組内閣、亦不允召集國會、故政局必須認爲極嚴重、</p>
<p>路透社十二日柏林電民黨要求下星期中召集國會、俾討論上星期六所公佈之緊急命令、如屬必要、得修改或取消之、此德國政潮所以倐然發生、國權黨亦主張召集國會、故若政府所有此時不宣召集國會之主張、不爲人重視、則内閣定須辭職、握時局之樞紐者爲社會黨、該黨所認爲緊急命令中不堪容受之條文、德總理若不修正之、則社會黨亦將與他黨同有此開會之要求、政府方面現希望政府與社會黨間可得折中互讓之辦法、民黨目的、顯欲强迫政府改組、尤欲撤回該黨黨員寇蒂斯、而另舉手腕較强之人以代之、報稱、民黨所屬意之人、爲現任駐英大使紐拉資、今日當道宣佈三月底止德國一年預算、約缺少六千四百五十萬鎊、目前衆所反對之緊急命令、其目的即在防免德國破産之危險、</p>
<p>路透社十二日柏林電各界爭購外幣、此爲時局吃緊中令人不寗之一點、以致銀行美金鈔票現形缺乏、匯市委員會已决定塡發半月内可在此換取銀行鈔票之紐約支票、查過去數日中、約有價値七百萬鎊之現金運往倫敦、</p>

<p>電通十三日東京電本日内田語往訪之記者云、予對於鐵道向無經騐、此後非努力不可、向來滿洲有所謂三重外交與四重外交、大抵以立塲異、故意見亦異、總之對華關係、祇須能互相諒解、即可圓滿解决、我何時赴任刻尙未定、但擬從速上任云云、</p>

<p>— 李邦棟</p>
<p>今日爲本校創立廿五週年紀念，又値大學擴充後之第四週年，兼舉行畢業典禮，亦即四年前之今日鄭校長重新蒞校視事之日也，吾校同仁於慶祝歡呼聲中，復承社會人士光臨參舉，以隆榮典，昨晚且由樊處長提倡預伸慶祝，亦若餪壽者然，今日校内之空氣飽滿，吾人精神上这愉快，誠有難以言喩者，在本校過去之成績，由中學以至單科大學，更由鄭校長擴充而爲整個大學之經過，本刋多有詳細追叙，無俟不佞贅述，不佞感念曁南所處之地位，以及所負之偉大使命，與夫比年突飛孟晉之氣象，今日之盛會，固逈非尋常之紀念可比，自較任何學府爲値得慶祝與讚揚也，不佞恭參斯盛，以爲吾校今日之紀念，至少含有三要義焉，</p>
<p>一曰促進社會人士對于曁南之認識</p>
<p>猶憶民十七年冬，不佞追隨鄭校長北上迎櫬，昔年校長爲政朔方，澤惠所被，賢聲載道，舊雨同僚，咸來請謁，有聞我校長方長曁南，竟有以校址何在爲詢者，不佞訝甚，且竊恨曁南之名何以不見稱於人人也，繼而思之，誠有難怪，蓋過去曁南，純係培植海外僑胞子弟，與國内人士殊少接觸，致不免隔閡，自鄭校長重來長校，卽首先擴充敎育之範圍，增廣敎育之旨趣，不僅爲僑胞造就子弟，且爲僑胞造就助長海外事業發展之國内優秀靑年，交換文化，所見務大，四年來對于國内社會之影響如何，今日廣義之曁南·與昔日狹義之曁南·就成績以觀·就使命以較·盛會之開·正所以促進社會人士對于曁南得有確切之認識也</p>
<p>二曰提高曁南在國際上之學術地位</p>
<p>夫一國之學術文化程進如何，必有其代表之學府，以崇國際上之觀瞻，如英之劍橋牛津，美之哈佛耶魯，法之巴黎，比之魯文，其所昭示，吾人舉能道之，然則吾國之學府其足以代表東方大國之文明，而爲世人所推重者，將誰屬耶，吾人固未敢妄許而謬譽，然以曁南歷史之短淺，而學子來自海外各屬，人才養成，還諸其地，在在莫不與異邦人民相接獨，相周旋，其在國際間之關係如何，文野程度，舉足以代表我國家，今大會有成績展覧，望而生感，剏造努力，則今後宜如何提倡曁南之學術文化以崇高國際上之地位耶，</p>
<p>三曰策進華僑唯一學府内容之充實</p>
<p>曁南剏校已歷二十五年，中經種種顚危挫折，又曾以政局紛紜，而絃歌中輟，大學擴充後亦僅四稔，校欵支絀，經常維持，已感困難，特種設備，曾不稍緩，僉由鄭校長長袖善舞，而典家質産，以維校用，尤爲人所難能，又嘗謂『我寧茹苦含辛，以建設學校于鞏固，再求人之贊襄，使益加發展，不願以虚聲惑人，昧然求助』，故曁南不肯輕易向海内外父老募捐，然觀學生歲占費在國立大學中爲最低，以經濟方法，獲今日之成績，値茲雙重紀念，吾人檢閲過去，責望將來，宜如何策進此唯一華僑學府，使其内容更臻充實，觀感所及，海内外不乏賢達熱心之士，此後倘亦樂於贊助曁南，以分肩我校長之厥責也耶，</p>
<p>由此觀之，則曁南之得有今日，端賴鄭校長之慘淡經營，未碩果成于遠因，曁南之特具精神，早基于剏校之時，請讀鄭校長剏校時手製之校歌，可窺知其來有自，非偶然也，敬錄之以殿吾文，藉弁于端，歌曰</p>
<p>爪島殖民本我先，溯自有朋前，胡爲父老竟酣眠，讓人着先鞭，</p>
<p>旣與歐人闢土田，還受苛税捐，哀我同胞墮九淵，何日覩靑天，</p>
<p>丈夫絶不受人憐，内渡賦聯翩，優勝劣敗原天演，好將科學研，</p>
<p>誓爲祖國張海權，大任吾黨肩，喚起僑魂風雲變，錦繡好山川，</p>

<p>— 鄭洪年</p>
<p>余以淸光緖三十三年與聞曁南剏校事，以民國十六年夏重任曁大校長；由前計之，迄今二十有五載；由後計之，改組以來亦已四年。嗚乎！華僑敎育，我中華民族隆替之樞紐，百千萬僑胞運命之所繫，固匪一朝一隅一人之細事也！余不揣力薄，爲先總理繼此未竟之宏願，肩荷重任以至今日；今當二十五週年紀念之期，前事不忘，敬述一二以爲國人告。</p>
<p>憶曁南學校之剏設，初非計劃前定。其時駐荷蘭公使錢念劬先生，遣參贊調查爪哇敎育狀况，深慮華僑子弟不知祖國文化，且有滅種之憂，乃電請兩江總督端方爲歸國僑生籌求學之地，端督接電之初，猶未知所謂爪哇者何義；及復電始知爪哇爲荷屬殖民地，有僑生二十一人將歸國求學，得淸廷報可，乃由董鴻褘先生護送北來，以僑生籍隸閩粤者多，乃使余及溫秉忠先生主其事；江南提學使陳伯陶先生力贊斯舉，且設校講誦，定名爲「曁南」。以國勢言，南洋早爲世界列强角逐之場，海外僑民爲人魚肉早蒙宰割之苦，曁南學校之設立，亦已晚矣。乃肉食者鄙，瞶然昧於世界大勢；端督剏設曁校，議者乃列之於彈章。張勳駐軍江寗，曁校卽被嚴厲之監視；彼時國人之於海外僑情，固如是其隔閡也。</p>
<p>然曁僑生愛國之熱烈，自剏校時已然。曁校創立於先總理組織同盟會之翌年，余彼時所製校歌，卽以喚醒民族觀念爲主旨，與總理革命之宗旨相吻合。故學生中革命思想至爲發皇。辛亥前後，學生往保定軍官學校者有之，往習海軍者有之；革命旣起，或往武漢，或往上海，皆以許身報國爲志。猶憶僑生李全發年最幼，一日語余曰：「南洋者吾中華民族之南洋，有志者不當南圖耶！」言雖率直，壯氣可貫日月矣；近世學者謂新興民氣多朝氣，僑生有之！</p>
<p>辛亥間，僑生旣星散，曁校亦中停。逮民國六年，以黃炎培先生奔走之力，重行籌辦，至民國七年，而曁校復開。自爾以還，曁校乃曲折前進：趙正平先生以民國七年任校長職，至民國十四年解職，先後任事凡七載。（民國十年間，柯箴心先生任校長一年）師範科商科之擴充，初中部之完成，商科大學之增設，眞如校地之圈購，校舍之建築，皆正平先生所擘劃經營者也。民國十四年秋，姜伯韓先生繼任校長，商科大學組織乃大定；且値變亂相尋，曁校得維護不墮者，伯韓先生及諸校董之力也。民國十六年夏，余奉命接收曁校，嗣膺校長之命。余以垂老之身，重長曁大，以私言：華僑敎育乃二十年來未了之心願，盡此一分職責，所以了心願也。以公言，總理以拯助僑胞爲民族革命目標之一，爲華僑增高敎育文化，所以答總理也。</p>
<p>余受命之初，卽事擴大組織，改組爲完全大學。商學院而外，中國語文學系，外國文學系，敎育心理學系，數理學系，法律學系，生物學系，歷史社會學系先後成立，規模粗定。夫剏始者難艱巨，百業皆然，敎育尤甚。彼時人才之消乏，物質之簡陋，在在足爲擴大組織之梗。余乃訪求名儒碩學，來主講席；崇尊師之禮，倡好學之風，凡所以集中人才蔚成學府者，竭吾心力，黽勉求之。至物質上之建築，民國十六年秋間，完成圖書館，冬間築成蓮韜館。其明年，先築科學館，繼築初中宿舍及敎舍。至民國十九年，致遠堂及高中宿舍中學部辦公處先後築成始與余預定之計劃相去不遠。籌數十萬之巨欵，營十數項之建築，余之心力亦已瘁矣！</p>
<p>目今組織，大學設文學院理學院法學院敎育學院商學院凡五院，中學部設普通科師範科商科農科及初級中學，凡五科，别設秘書處訓育處洪年圖書館及南洋美洲文化事業部四處分掌職務，與敎務相輔而行。年來思想界空疎淺薄，靑年學子浮光掠影，實堪殷憂；余力矯此弊，大學專科分系，以養成專攻學術之風，各家學說，其並行不悖者，聽學生自由研究，但期深造，不鶩虚聲。年來社俗澆薄，個人利已之風日張，舉凡蠅營狗苟之汚行，公然飾之以美辭，恬然居之而不知恥，舊倫理旣毁棄殆盡，新倫理漫無綱紀，淪人道於禽獸，可爲寒心。余力懲此短，以倫理爲人紀之先；在校則崇師道，在家則睦親誼，在社會則持正義，在國家則守公忠；相期今日之好靑年，爲異日之良公民，年來黨同伐異，隨地皆然；敎育界以高尙自鳴，而亦同此汚濁。前數年，余以一身與所謂派系者敵，彼以私來我以公應；人之欲取曁南大學爲播植勢力計者，卒亦廢然以返。往年，亦常有因緣波盪而成之風潮，近乃師生相安，一無間然，純趨於學術上之競爭矣。中學敎育則以嚴格訓練爲主，課程重基本練習，亦重職業指導，訓育取道德訓練，陶成完全人格。中學爲大學之基礎，中學生爲社會之骨幹，所謂基本敎育者也。中學生而放蕩不覊，工具不精習，難以窺學術之堂奥，行爲不檢點，難以受艱困之磨鍊，所謂玉不琢不成器也。且僑生天性率眞，情感易衝動，放任則流於粗魯，剪理榛楛，乃可成材，此余之所以主嚴格訓練也。至僑生愛國之忱，流爲過激，余則以宣導爲主。蓋僑生萬里歸國，脫身於千鈞高壓之帝國主義鐵腕中，喘息初蘇，感慨常深，身受民族間不平等之待遇，眷懷故國，望治之心倍切。且吾校學生，皆中産以下子弟，民間疾苦，素所知聞，家國興亡，引爲已任；主持敎育者，自不宜阻此朝氣。宣導之方，使靑年改就平實，或研究文學，或研究科學，或研究體育，各擅一技，各治一科，以朝氣臨之，自能精進無已。吾校體育，無間大學中學，平均發展，不待提倡而技術日進，此其證也。學生之課外修習，以圖書館研究室爲輔助，圖書館藏中西文圖書十餘萬卷，年增圖書費六千元以爲常。研究室，院部分設，以敎授爲導師，學生各就所學，專題研究，研究所得，彙刋季刋以公諸學術界。其關於南洋文化之研究，則南洋美洲文化事業部主之，刋行南洋研究及南洋叢書以促國人之注意，印發南洋通訊以傳播國内之消息，南洋重要問題，部中人員分題專治，著爲論文以備僑胞之參攷。至若歸國僑生之指導，在校僑生之監護，則訓育處主之；則政之出納，庶務之措理，則秘書處主之。吾校財政，完全公開，一錢之微皆可稽核；則又余長校以來之方針，歷屆事務人員所共守者也。</p>
<p>前言之矣，華僑敎育匪一朝一隅一人之細事，竭吾愚私，所歎汲深莫及！敎育所以適應社會之需求；僑胞所期望於吾曁大者，培植工商業之專才，華僑敎育之師資；二十五年間所養者果有幾許？僑胞所期望於吾曁在者，工商業之實際改革方案，經濟政策之改進方案，二十五年間所曾爲僑胞謀者果有幾許；不但此也，海外華僑學校仰外人之鼻息，聽其自生自滅，吾曁大未籌褓育之策：十百萬僑胞失學子弟，聽其優勝劣敗，歸於天演，吾曁大未籌救濟之方；華僑敎育之事業者，吾曁大未嘗盡其一育，參差不齊，又以南洋各屬開發先後之不同，因而受敎育之年齡至相懸殊，吾曁大未能酌此事實，分别補救；僑生在海外皆受嚴格管理，父兄又嚴爲提嘶，萬里歸國，遠離父兄，吾曁大未能盡父師之責，時或淪於放佚：僑生多貧寒子弟，而俊秀者轉在貧寒之中，吾曁大未能裕籌經費，扶此英才；究言之，曁大以華僑敎育自稱，仍無以異於他校，此余之所日夕焦思者也！嗚呼！民族精神一日不振作，中華國運卽一日無隆盛之希望：中華民族一日不復興，弱小民族卽一日無昭蘇之生機：南洋問題一日不解决，世界和平卽一日無實現之可能！余以衰老之身，貢獻於曁南大學，卽所以貢獻於華僑敎育：所以報答總理，卽所以報答國家：國人乎，僑胞乎！吾曁南大學之師生乎，衆擎易舉，爲中華民族爭此一息，庶乎可以與列强競爭也！</p>

<h3 id="c135">曁南大學之回顧與前瞻 <a href="#c135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>— 樊守執</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>曁南大學誕生於淸光緒三十三年，（一九○七年）直到今年，恰好是二十五年。曁南大學是肩負『華僑敎育』這個特殊使命的學校，她的生命和海外千百萬華僑的生命息息相呼應，他的歷史卽華僑生命史的寫照，在這個重要意義上，我們應得回頭看這二十五年來的演進。</p>
<p>在滿淸末年『民族自覺』的空氣非常濃厚，孫總理的革命事業，那時最努力的是喚醒民族的自覺。同時資本主義勢力圈擴張到太平洋上，南洋羣島成爲帝國主義者角逐之場；海外僑胞寄人籬下，劈頭便感受到帝國主義者的壓迫，因此，孫總理的革命事業，僑胞認識得最早，贊助亦最力。曁南學校卽在這瀰漫的民族自覺空氣中産生出來。</p>
<p>首先注意華僑敎育的是駐荷蘭公使錢念劬先生，他明白中華民族在國際上的危機，電請兩江總督端方爲僑生在國内籌劃一個求學的去處。端督得了淸庭許可，便請今校長鄭洪年先生和温秉忠先生主持這件事。第一批回國僑生，都是從爪哇來的，共二十三人，後來八馬壟諫義里巴城泗水等處先後送些僑生回國，在創辦第二年的冬天，僑生已有一百十五人。二年之間，僑生增加得這麽快、可見海外僑胞嚮往祖國，眞是非常熱烈的。在僑生中，都迫切地期望中國的復興，對於民族革命，不僅同情，而且鼓着勇氣去參加；那時曁南學校在南京，成爲革命的中心點。鄭校長對於革命事業，竭力愛護，他所做的校歌有『誓爲祖國張海權，大任吾黨肩；喚起僑魂風雲變，錦繡好山川』之句，沸騰了多少靑年的熱血！</p>
<p>但這愛國的熱血中斷了曁南的生命；淸庭對於端督設立曁校收容革命靑年，說了許多閑話。江寧將軍竟用旗籍敎員來監視曁校，張勳駐兵南京，對於没有辮子的僑生，更視爲大逆不道。宣統三年，革命軍在武昌起義，長江下流各省先後響應；曁南僑生忍不着這蟄塞的空氣，便分頭往武昌上海參加革命工作，於是曁南學校便無形地解散了。</p>
<h3 id="c136">秘書長樊守執先生 <a href="#c136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>曁南學校的復開，是在民國七年。鄭校長對於曁校中停，深爲惋惜，幾次想設法重開，終於没有成功。因爲袁世凱怕僑生從事革命，又怕僑生帮孫總理的忙，在他生前，曁南重開是無望的了。洪憲帝政失敗，袁世凱去世，黃炎培先生往來奔走，於民國六年冬間，開始籌辦，於民國七年春間正式成立，以趙正平爲校長。那時，歐戰正烈，白色人種相斫事忙，爲暇東顧，南洋羣島的工商業卽在這機會中抬起頭來。復興後的曁校，適合這個環境的需求：第一爲僑胞培植一些商業上的人才，第二爲僑胞培植一些華僑學校的師資。趙正平先生任校長七年，對於師範科商科二科最爲注意，設備亦最完全，後來，還增設了商科大學部。</p>
<p>校址從南京移到眞如來，也是趙正平先生的計劃，他認定振興商業爲南洋僑胞自救的唯一法門，所以努力造就商業專門人寸。校址移至上海相近，其意即在使學生與現代都市相接近，使學生有實習的機會。可奈民國十三年校舍剛落成，江浙戰事便爆發了；原有商科大學的學生，還得借學於中國公學，更不必說什麽擴充了。</p>
<p>民國十四年以後，姜伯韓先生接連做了兩年校長。在時局反復變幻中，勉强把商科大學部組織完全，又把高中文理科師範科商科及初中部充實起來。僑胞在歐戰以後，暫時還能維持商業上的地位，那幾年回國僑生甚多；民國十五年間，學生增至七百餘人。接着便是國民革命的大潮流來了，民國十六年春間，國民革命軍佔領了江浙，曁校乃由鄭校長之手擴充爲完全大學。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>鄭校長復任校長的志願是非常宏大的；他要把曁南大學基礎穩固下來，他要盡瘁華僑敎育來報答孫總理，他要建設一個研究學術的純粹學府來慰華僑父老的期望。海外僑胞散處各地，總數在六百萬以上，以千分比例算，僑生至少在萬人上下；曁校原有建築，至多只能容五百人，在物質上無論如何是不够的。四年來，鄭校長極力籌劃物質上的建設，先後築成蓮韜館，科學館，大禮堂，初中宿舍，高中宿舍，女生宿舍，敎職員宿舍，敎職員住宅，中學部辦公處，中學部敎室共十餘項，依現况論，已可容千五百人之數。至於圖書儀器及體育設備等等，年年增設，近十萬元之數。曁南大學在草創局面中，没有這巨量物質上的建設，基礎是難得穩固的，鄭校長便把這責任担負起來。</p>
<p>孫總理的革命事業，得力於海外僑胞帮助之處非常之多，所以總理一生常以僑胞休戚爲念，一心要把僑胞從不平等鐵腕拯救出來。但革命事業尙未完成孫總理不幸已長逝了。酬答海外僑胞的心願竟未達到。鄭校長接辦曁南，卽是繼承孫總理的心願。鄭校長說：『我願獻此身辦好華僑敎育，使海外父老，恢復固有的民族精神，亦可對得起先總理，慰他在天之靈。』這四年間，鄭校長雖爲國從公，不能常住校中，但他的心念没有一刻不在爲曁南校籌劃一切的。</p>
<p>鄭校長辦理曁南大學的方針是要把曁南大學造成一個研究學術的純粹學府。他說：『救國不是空口狂喊所能做得到的，要救國惟有埋頭研究學術。』自從國民政府成立以後，訓政卽已開始；像中國這様地大物博，什麽都不缺少，所缺少的，只是學術專門人才。五四運動以後，把學生從學校喊到街上來，滿街儘是愛國的靑年，現在大家都該覺悟了，應該從街上回到研究室中去了。鄭校長四年來毎次講演都把『學術救國』的話沉痛地提出來，並且指點一九二八年以後的世界經濟危機，華僑經濟破産的趨勢，用以證明僑生研究學術才是華僑自救的大道。現在，在學部的文學院敎育學院理學院法學院商學院五院，中學部的普通科師範科商科農科及初中五科，都已完全成立，各部院的敎授敎員，鄭校長以集中人才爲主旨，從各地禮聘而來，在研究學術這個旗幟之下，共同努力起來。</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>紀念日近了，我們回頭看看過去，這二十五年間已經完成了三件工作：Ａ，在民族自覺運動中引起了僑胞對於祖國的認識，Ｂ，在華僑經濟復興中培植了許多商業上敎育上的專門人才，Ｃ，爲華僑敎育立百年基礎，把曁南大學擴充爲學術研究的完全大學。我們再舉目看看將來，對於『華僑敎育』這個重要使命，應得努力的地方正是很多。</p>

<p>鄭校長說：「我來辦曁南是爲了安慰自已的良心，我是不以曁南爲我個人的工具的，爲我個人的權利的；大家應該擁護曁南，不必擁護我個人。」大家應該擁護曁南，這是一句根本的話。一切事業，都是千百人一點一滴地造成；鄭校長在物質建設上擴充組織上費盡了他的心力，如何把這個事業繼續下去，如何把這個事業擴在起來，這是大家的責任。以物質建設上而論，體育館博物館膳廳等重要建築物，在鄭校長預定計劃之中，姑且不提。一個大學的圖書館儲藏千萬卷書籍，科學館設置千萬元的試騐所，原是極普通的事，我們曁南大學現在總覺得離這個標準還很遠。一個大學的學術研究，産生一個有力量的學派，如法蘭西學院巴黎文科大學高等師範學校及古簡學校各自代表史學上的一個派别，也是極普通的事。我們曁南大學雖以華僑敎育爲標的，但特殊研究的成績畢竟還很少。南洋羣島爲世界各種專門學術的試騐所，我們曁南大學除了敎導歸國僑生而外，對于可供專門學術的南洋，尙應分别去考察。鄭校長所提學術研究的方針，我們已做了一個引端，那迢迢的前途，應得從今天起，担着重担一步一步走過去的！</p>
<p>南洋華僑近年所經歷的磨難，可以說是近百年來最困苦的磨難，但在最近的將來，决没有解脫這個磨難的可能。曁南大學旣與華僑生命息息相關，解脫磨難的途徑，我們應得替僑胞找尋出來。而且世界大戰萬一爆發起來，南洋羣島在英日美三國勢力圈中，僑胞將經騐一個更困苦的磨難，如何來預防這個磨難，救濟這個磨難，我們也應得替僑胞計劃一下。這是當前的重大責任，我們不能不共同担負起來！</p>
<p>總之：廿五年眞是短短一個期限，我們所曾盡力的眞是很少！鄭校長以一身兩次爲華僑敎育盡力，我們應得共同來繼續他的事業！我們莫忘了「學術救國」，我們莫忘了擁護曁南，那才能完全華僑敎育的使命呀！</p>

<p>有五百元之財産的、或是識字的智識階級、三者只要有其一、都要被殺戮的、今日在座各位、恐怕都具有上述三種資格的、由匪徒看來、都是在屠殺之列的、現在我們不去救濟被匪災之江西人民、將來匪勢益衆、到了全國皆匪、那時人但我們不能救濟他人、恐怕連救我們的人都没有了、所以救江西即是救中國、救江西災民、即是救各人本身、上海各界、對於西北及東北之夫災、已募有巨大金額、想對於爲害程度有千百倍之江西匪災、必能熱心振助云云、次許世英演說、謂西北和東北的天災看得見聽得到、只要有錢、死者可以掩埋、寒者可得衣、飢者可得食、江西的人災、被屠殺者幾十萬、餓死凍死者幾十萬、逃難出了無處可歸者又幾百萬、不但看不見、連確實的數目、都不能前往調查、若不急行救濟、將來偪而爲匪的益多、我們要先救江西、才可以說救中國云云、次虞洽卿演說、江西土匪問題、乃是國家存亡民族生死的問題、比任何問題爲重大、江西問題能解决、廣東問題可不必慮及、所以我們要各盡力量去救助云云、次王曉籟演說、謂我們在上海的各界、雖然已經寫了許多次捐、但是終願我們在上海的去救他人、不願他人江西橫峯縣鄉村匪刦後之慘狀</p>
<p>來救在上海的我們、况且熊司令在上海、爲歷來所未有之賢明司令、我們各團體、對於陜西旱災、尙且募了十八萬餘金、對於熊司令提倡之江西賑務、當更熱心捐助云云、</p>

<p>— 方楚囚</p>
<p>革命之風，吾皖唱之最早者。當推淮上梁烈士廷棟昆仲。烈士字石卿。世居皖之壽縣。性仁而毅。好交任俠。淸光緖末葉。見國是日非。因走四方。廣交游。所至輙以革新之義，相機啓導。履險蹈危。十餘年如一日。至冀北。慨然曰。燕趙古稱多慷慨悲歌士。雖其風氣閉塞。然可以大義開之也。遂居北平。時與毅軍官佐士兵。往還甚洽。舊日同志。多往依之。會淸宣統嗣位。載灃攝政。隆裕太后。欲追論戊戍政變事。置袁世凱於法。軍民皇皇然。烈士密與毅軍同志。謀乘機舉義。爲嗜利者所洩。政府索之急。乃間道走吉林。隱居長春。易名梁擎宇。同志復繼續而至。用不充。鬻文爲活。其季弟廷樾。字卓卿。天資孝友。長於語言。通金石算術音樂之學。感乃兄所志不酬。假敎育圖進步。倡私塾改良。自任敎授。不受俸。而樂人之樂。憂人之憂。久之朋從衆多。忌者陷之。縣吏疑焉。禍機雖伏。而氣不少餒。尋即奉母命之長春。晤其兄廷棟。至則其三兄廷櫰。已先在焉。廷櫰一名冰。字蔭靑。少與廷棟同志。先是熊烈士成基在皖舉事。旣敗。東渡日本。而至吉林。廷櫰自北平與謀。就東三省倡義。旋熊爲藏貫三所賣。被捕。搜獲廷櫰北平寓址。吉撫陳昭常。密電淸廷。購捕甚急。而廷櫰聞風得脫。遂至長春。辛亥秋。武昌義軍起。全國響應。廷棟兄弟與同志議曰。内地漸次光復矣。東三省爲邊陲重要地。趙爾巽等擁兵自固。謀抵抗。若不速圖破之。必將擁戴小朝廷。號召滿蒙。而以日俄外交。牽制其間。則南軍雖盛。不無鞭長莫及之憂。是宜集民軍。舉義旗。策應中原。於是同志劉乾一商震等。在奉天公推藍天蔚爲關外大都督。而烈士昆促。分任吉黑事。即於哈爾濱設機關部。出孫大總統黎副總統檄東三省文。偏示同志曰。此正大丈夫立功之會也。衆皆踴躍。相與計曰。東三省萬山叢錯。而綠林出没。軍警密布。今日之事。軍警無綠林之鼓動。則發難無機。綠林無軍警之監視。則操縱無術。當以綠林牽制軍警。以軍警範圍綠林。僉曰善。乃以陶遇春王文峯等聨警士。莊玉書姚脩雲等聯軍隊。王澤臣李範五等結合地方團體。谷繡齋等招撫綠林。於是田邊羊等。大股劉漢之衆。輸誠受約以待。而濱江道李家鰲。統帶么佩珍皆通欵。廷樾則任外交。而得各領事承認中立、遂拔龍幟易五色幟。而慶光復矣。即假自治公所。召集官紳軍警商學議庶政。除苛税。釋獄囚。安民護商。秩序井然。七鬯不驚。皆呼萬歲。趙爾巽等聞之。急易幟圖自保。繼聞淸廷遜位。南北停戰。而吉撫陳昭常。希冀任都督。嫉黨人。以降將么佩珍爲其舊部也。嗾使出不意。攻民軍。戰竟日。彈盡援絶。廷棟廷樾竟及於難。同殉者陶君遇春。王君澤臣。李君範五等十餘人。各處民軍。失領袖。多自動散去。然猶守成約不擾民。且相約改行曰。不忍爲梁先生兄弟遺臭也。濱江夙爲綠林嘯聚所。居民出必戒備。惟革命時。綠林皆守約歛迹。濱人至今思之。廷棟有丈夫子一。名大宗。廷樾一子名大昕。皆能承其先人遣志。而廷櫰爲國奔走。從事革命。三十年來。迄未少懈。顧其家道即因以中落。至饔飱不給。廷櫰略不置意。常曰。爲國忘家。志士不當如是耶。其胸襟之闊也。又如此。余悲兩烈士之遇。更壯廷櫰之志。故特表而出之。俾天下後世得所徵焉</p>
<h3 id="c208">記楊妃荔支 <a href="#c208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— 蟬退</p>
<p>我雖不敗吹這海外牛皮。說什麽足跡走遍中國的名山。口腹飽嘗各處名品。但以我所得的地方而論。「足跡半天下。」這個半字。儘有盤旋餘地了。食物更不必提。就以荔支說吧。我是四川人。生於北平。長於浙江。游蹤所至。南北東西。只要有閑暇工夫。我口說。呌兩名書記寫稿子。這部游記。或可比美名山記了。</p>
<p>我是民國五年隨軍入蜀。民國六年駐紮嘉陵。嘉陵山水甲於天下。所以城門上有這一副海螺嚮的聯語。「嘉陵三百里。　苑十二樓。」唐明皇入蜀。愛嘉陵山水。曾命吳道子圖嘉陵三百里於屏風之上。嘉陵山水不能搬移到上海。我說嘉陵山水是大靑大綠。亦只一句話、不能證實。就有攝影器具。只能得其形似。不能得其精神。但因爲唐明皇的愛吳道子的畫。寓目者必能相信於無言了。</p>
<p>再說這十二樓。第一是鳳皇樓。是大周金輪皇帝降生之地。特設此樓以爲紀念。樓高三丈。上有碧玉鐘一懸。碧玉鐘爲天下罕見的至寳。鐘上所鑄的字。均爲武后所製。大可爲文字上考證。</p>
<p>第二是楊妃樓。楊妃之父楊元琰。爲蜀利州司户。利州即今　中縣。樓在府署之後。相傳即司户住宅。楊妃曾自植荔支百樹。今猶成園。其荔支中腰有紅線一捻。故别名「一捻紅。」楊妃入宮册爲貴妃。明皇特詔利州剌史。置驛郵遞。故唐人詩中有「一騎紅塵妃子笑。無人知是荔支來」之句。即洪昉思長生殿。對於楊妃荔支曾有長調歌之。可見楊妃荔支是四川的名品了。</p>
<p>民國七年五月。我曾一度兼揶攝　中縣。在任四十七日。又有什麽政績可言。但是對於楊妃荔支。園在樹後。且爲隔年一産。我在任的日子。正値荔支初熟。要是前淸時代。本屬貢品。縣官累煞。那還敢吃得一顆。現在民國了。縣官之大。大於黃牛。四鄉的農産。尚可勒爲官有。何况本署之荔支。毎値公餘之暇。邀同三五僚屬。煑酒於園内。就於樹頭摘食初熟的荔支。色味的美。水氣的鮮。眞不愧爲楊妃之名。我毎次所吃。可得百顆。當比較上海市賣的荔支。相差何啻有霄壤之别。所以我今天入市。購得一簍荔支。雖說初到上海的鮮果。究不及樹頭摘鮮的味美了。</p>

<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>張小三兒道。「。好巡警瞧不起我罷了。我自家媳婦也瞧不起我。房子是老子租下的。房錢是老子出的。你憑什麽關着門不讓我進去。」說着。對門一脚。噗鼕一聲踢開。跳了進去。對伊瞪着眼道。「你吃老子的。喝老子的。你敢和老子蹩扭。老子要揍你。反正拉洋車的都鬧不過警察。大不了。一塊上區子裏去。」他一路駡着。一路走了進來。只見靠墻的白爐。火勢正旺。上面的小鐵鍋。蓋着一層籠屜。鍋裏骨都骨都的響聲。冲出一陣陣的白氣。由這白氣裏面。帶着一股子窩頭香。看這様子。鍋裏蒸着窩頭。準是快熟了。張小三肚子裏。正是餓得難受。一聞到了這種香味。禁不住就要流出口水來。於是走上前去。一掀屜蓋。只見熱氣瀰漫中。籠屜裏蒸着上十個拳頭大的窩頭。黃澄澄的。抹上一陣汽水。現着是蒸透了。在牆上筷子筒裏。抽了一雙筷子。正待向籠屜裏一挿。張二嫂搶了過來。將籠屜蓋上。用手按着道。别忙。我問你。昨天你扔下錢買棒子麵（注·棒子麵·即玉蜀黍所磨之粉·製窩窩頭者也·）没有。」張小三道。「没有又怎麽着。」張二嫂道。「這不結了。你說我吃你的。穿你的。這可見得我不是吃着你的。這是我在裁縫店裏接着活。（注·凡工作之事·平語皆謂之活·如理髮匠出門剃頭謂之外活是）作來的錢買的。你算吃我的了。我該怎麽辦。」張小三道。「你天天吃我的。我吃你一頓。也不算什麽。」張二嫂道。「吃一頓。你算算。這十天吃我多少頓了。有錢你就上茶館。聽說書的胡扯。回得家來。薛仁貴征東。黃天霸招親。還得學上三天三晚。二三十歲的人。還得要媳婦兒養活你啦。」伊囉哩囉唆。說上這一大段。手依然按着籠屜蓋。不讓張小三去掀開。張小三拿了一條矮凳子。向屁股下一塞。蹲着身子。坐了下去。見張二嫂站在那裏。兩手抬起來。去摸攏頭上的亂髮。把兩隻大袖子抬將起來。露出伊那兩隻大白乳。一哆嚕的向下埀着。不覺噗哧一聲笑了。張二嫂見他一笑。更有了門兒了。端着一把破籐椅子。斜向他坐着。兩手拿了衣襟下擺。向上翻動着。當了扇子摇。越扇越高。衣擺翻上來。露也了肚臍眼。</p>
<h3 id="c210">「說謊者」的比較研究 <a href="#c210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— 韻先</p>
<p>復旦劇社第十一次公演之名劇</p>
<p>在瓊斯的「說謊者」的劇情中間。藏着作者的靈魂。而這神技的靈魂。扮了嘻皮笑臉的人物。對全世界的大衆宣說。離婚是不幸的。說謊是不可能的。飽經世故。嘗遍艱辛而對自已的痴心的朋友張景凱。苦口婆心勸說他回頭的林望仙。顯明地是看透了世人的心幕的此劇的作者自身。這裏的林望仙。認爲引誘有夫之婦。雖然是出於神聖的精神上的熱戀。也是不應當的。看來。爲張景凱的瓊斯。是戴了禮敎的面具而說敎的道學先生。自由戀愛。在現時代。是誰者承認的神聖事件。不應加以任何壓迫的。無論伊或他是有夫之婦或有婦之夫。如果夫婦間已經没有愛情。這建築在死去了的愛情上的婚姻。是無須必要他維持的。要是頭腦淸醒的人物。全都這麽想。那麽。如此說來。瓊斯是頭腦腐敗的舊時代的份子了。不必在今日再來出演他的著作的了。</p>
<p>可是又不然。</p>
<p>瓊斯是何等様的人物呢。是舊禮敎的維持者麽。慢慢。請翻讀比「說謊者」早二年作成的「瑪加爾及其失去的天使」吧。這個劇本。是單刀直入地攻擊着舊禮敎的。是逼出血來地攻擊着敎會敎堂的。「瑪加爾及其失去的天使」的攻擊舊禮敎。舊道德。比在「說謊者」中批評離婚的不當加十倍的激烈。</p>
<p>「說謊者」中的著者。對於專心一意懇摯地熱纞着的張景凱。全無同情地驅他人失戀的苦海中不得超度。在第四幕中末了之處。頗有喜劇一變而爲悲劇的情調的。這被戀人突然不顧道聲珍重再會而去的張景凱這時候的苦悶。給觀衆十足地同情。感動了起來。甚至替他抱不平的。而作者終於送他上那裏只有苦熱焦渴工作的南洋去。作者在這等處所。十分表示了他是冷淡而薄情的人物。可是作如此想的先生們。亦請一讀「瑪加爾乃其失去的天使」吧。此中出於同一手筆的作者。是充滿着對於人生抱有好感的熱情的。</p>
<p>現在。將兩部同時瓊斯貢獻給世界劇壇的不朽的傑作比較觀照。我們才明白他不是舊道德的維持者。不是薄情的冷淡人物。那末我們得問。爲什麽在「說謊者」裏。作者表現了在「瑪加爾及其失去的天使」裏的相反的傾向呢。如果容許我下句斷語的話。這是大作家的瓊斯的反面寫法。是他技巧的變化的塲所。也是他變態的手段。</p>
<p>無論如何。著者借了林望仙的嘴說了下面似的話。是對於目前正鬧着離婚熱的中國的男男女女的唯一的當頭棒喝。</p>
<p>「伊不要以爲你結了婚。就可以放下你的妻子不去理伊了。不能的。你現在娶了一個上海最漂亮的女子了。可是假如你不繼續跟伊再戀愛着。别的人會跟伊戀愛了。没有話說的。這是人生的悲劇。」（敏時按。該劇已由復旦劇社朱端鈞君改譯並導演。於月之十三十四兩日在寗波旅滬同鄉會舉行公演。復旦劇社和。久著聲譽。此次公演。其第十一次也。）</p>

<p>昨日糖市産區中電訉、古巴現糖價仍一·三一二五、紐約期糖九月份價一·二九、比前續升一分、十二月份價一·三七、未有升沉、明年度三月份一·四五、五月份一·五一、亦各升一分、爪哇現糖價八盾、期糖七八月份價均八·一二五、與前依然無升降、公會市塲劃盤、交易仍靜、荷糖二十四號粗砂白買氣略見活躍、初市十一兩四錢七分半、出户見缺、旋升十一兩五錢、市形殊平、二十號中砂白十兩○八錢半、受手殊寥、日糖交易亦屬零落、ＥＲ嘜十一兩七錢、ＹＰ嘜同價、ＹＴ嘜十兩三錢、ＹＲＯ嘜十兩○九錢半、市象均見平定、號盤交易更靜、僅禎祥號開售現貨粗砂白一千袋、價十一兩五錢、趨勢殊屬不奇云、</p>

<p>四川榨菜今庚因出産豐盛、來源頗多、以致供過於求、市價步降、現下已到底盤、昨市上中莊僅售二十一二元、較之最高價相差十餘元之多、故業中有擬購入囤積者、市勢或能因此回好少許、亦未可知、</p>

<p>八號·十號·十二號以及十三號·十四號等新鉛絲、新近交易、大有雨後春草之勢、聞其購辦者、統係長江帮、而天津帮點綴聞亦不弱、行情因供不應求、扶摇直上、計估十兩至十二兩不等、但後市餘貨枯竭、行情有逐步加高之象云、</p>

<h3 id="e6">Opening Address <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The text of the opening address by Chairman Yu Youren at the opening ceremony of the Fifth Plenary Session is as follows:</p>
<p>Today is the opening day of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Third Central Executive Committee of our Party. We deeply remember the instructions of the Premier's great will, based on the procedures for the founding and construction of the nation, the needs for the survival and prosperity of the nation, following the revolutionary path, to devote ourselves to the completion of this great task. The Central Executive Committee, due to the heavy responsibility it bears, in every period of revolutionary development, first decides on the appropriate guidelines and their implementation plans, as the criteria for the will and actions of all party members, and expects to achieve success with determination and diligence. Externally, it assesses the international situation, and internally, it adapts to the aspirations of the people, to determine the central work in a period. The convocation of each Central Plenary Session is based on this purpose, so it can be considered appropriate and implemented thoroughly. The government follows the course of events, and the people and party members are of one mind and work together. In recent years, in quelling disasters and providing relief, we have not forgotten the work of revitalizing the industry after the pain. Recently, the National Assembly has been convened and completed in accordance with the Premier's will. The Premier's earnest instructions to the party members and the people of the country, time is passing, and the mountains are in sight. The people's livelihood is urgent, and the fate of the country is at stake. We will formulate fundamental laws and make long-term plans. All the meetings accept the Premier's entire will and adhere to the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution of our Party, and the implementation of the provisional constitution during the period of political tutelage, and the matters decided by the meeting that should be led and handled by the Party and the government, should first be planned in detail and implemented. The most important thing is that the provisional constitution during the period of political tutelage is actually the people's recognition of the exercise of the political power of our Party based on their revolutionary needs and political choices, which can fulfill their expectations, and therefore entrust the responsibility of nation-building and governing the country to our Party. Our Party also solemnly agrees with the people on what it should bear, expecting to see results in the coming years. The rights and obligations of the people during this period are determined by the principles and goals pursued by our Party, weighing the importance and urgency. As for the responsibilities of the government, the regulations should be as detailed and sincere as possible, with the people's livelihood and education as the central issues of the revolution, so that the government can do its best to be a faithful servant of the people, so that the revolutionary interests can be returned to the people, and the economic and political realities can be completed by the revolutionary government. The revolutionary demands, the internal crises accumulated in the society, and the aggression imposed on our country and nation by the international community can all be eliminated in a peaceful and happy environment through the implementation of this fundamental law. As for other cases transferred by the meeting, such as the procedures for industrial construction and the trends of educational facilities, all are regarded by our Party as matters that the government should decide and implement, and they are still in line with the spirit of the provisional constitution. Therefore, the party's governance from now on is actually the people's governance of the whole country, and the government from now on is actually the government of the whole people. This is the first thing that the Central Committee should urgently gather to discuss the guidelines to lead the government and the people after the completion of the National Assembly. According to the provisional constitution, the National Government has the power to govern the Republic of China. The provisional constitution of the Republic of China during the period of political tutelage has been promulgated, so the government organization should be completed according to law. The provisional constitution stipulates that during the period of political tutelage, the National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang, representing the National Assembly, exercises the central ruling power, and when the National Congress is not in session, its powers are exercised by the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang. Therefore, the convocation of this Central Plenary Session, regarding the bill on the government organization, is actually an important part of the implementation of the agreement. There must be a good system to have a good government. The consolidation of the central government and the unification of the country are of great importance. As for the formulation of various laws mentioned in the provisional constitution, the implementation of various resolutions passed by the Congress, the start of local autonomy during the period of political tutelage, and all construction projects, all depend on a strong government to take charge and plan for their success. This is the second thing that the Central Committee should urgently gather to discuss the scale and complete the organization regarding the political system after the promulgation of the provisional constitution. Our country and our nation have been disrupted by the Red bandits for many years, and the devastation of various places is extremely cruel in the history of the world. The loss of people's lives and the complete destruction of the production and business of rural and urban areas are regarded by the Red bandits as the result of class struggle, and the creation of the country and the nation has been unbearable to ask. Therefore, our Party is exhausted in persuading and repairing, and it must resort to the use of troops to quell the chaos, otherwise the people will not be able to protect their survival, let alone live and work in peace and enjoy the rule of law. Recently, since the Guangdong incident occurred, according to reports from the front, the Red bandits are very happy about it. This is truly related to the survival of our country and the rise and fall of our nation. If the comrades do not work together with one heart and the people of the whole country do not urgently mobilize, and are organized under the unified and clear command of the central government, and urged by the generals who are loyal and diligent in serving the country, the situation will spread and it will be difficult to plan, trapping the national economy and the people's livelihood in an unrecoverable situation. How can the revolutionary people and the revolutionary government save themselves and survive, and how can the revolutionary Party fulfill its responsibilities? Therefore, the Central Committee should gather to discuss strategies and work hard to suppress the bandits, appease the local areas, and stop the spread of chaos. This is the third thing. The task of this Central Plenary Session is huge and the timing is serious. We should deeply respect the Premier's instructions, examine the urgent needs of the Party and the country, and gather the wisdom and strength of the people to greatly comfort the people and the comrades. Now that the meeting is about to begin, I respectfully deliver this address. (Special dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<h3 id="e7">Two Proposals from the Standing Committee <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) On the morning of the 13th, the Standing Committee of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Third Central Executive Committee submitted the following two cases: the handling of the Guangdong Incident and the suppression of bandits.</p>
<p>(A) Report on the Handling of the Guangdong Incident and Request for a Decision on Policy. It stated that our Party is following the Premier's will and seeking the implementation and completion of political tutelage. On May 5, the National Government convened the National Assembly in the capital and formulated the provisional constitution. The political general report案submitted by the government, the report案on eradicating the Red bandits, the construction implementation procedure案, and the education policy案, etc., were all unanimously resolved by the Congress, and the responsibility for implementing all resolutions was entrusted to the government. On May 17, the National Assembly closed. On June 1, the National Government promulgated the provisional constitution. At this time, we should have done our best to lead the people of the whole country, with one heart and one mind, to inherit the legacy of peace and struggle, and to go to the future of political tutelage and construction. Unfortunately, a small number of comrades were confused by rumors, disregarded the warning that bandits would eventually be fierce, and plotted to break the situation of peace and unification. They gathered in Guangzhou and went astray. The central government has been mediating in good faith for more than a month. Tracing back to the beginning of the Guangdong incident, Gu Yingfen and others suddenly issued a telegram from Guangzhou on April 30, making an unreasonable and illegal accusation against Comrade Chiang Kai-shek. The allegations they picked up were all floating rumors. Comrade Chiang submitted to the Central Supervisory Committee on May 1, requesting an investigation. The Central Supervisory Committee believed that the 30 telegrams of Gu and others were picked up floating words, which would not damage Comrade Chiang's hair. Also, because the people who signed the telegram may not all agree with the telegram, they should first ask in detail to clarify the content. Therefore, Cai Yuanpei, Zhang Puquan, Li Shizeng, Zhang Jingjiang, and Wu Zhihui were requested to send a telegram to Gu and others to correct their mistakes. On the one hand, Sun Ke, who was in Shanghai, was invited to jointly persuade and maintain peace. Unexpectedly, Gu and others had no sign of repentance. After Sun Ke entered Guangdong, he was seduced by Tang Shaoyi, Wang Jingwei, Chen Jitang, and others. On May 25, Tang Shaoyi led the telegram. Since then, the comrades in Guangdong Province have been trapped and unable to extricate themselves. Although the comrades of the Central Committee and the party departments at all levels at home and abroad have repeatedly persuaded, all the evil and corrupt elements have taken advantage of the temporary mistakes of the comrades in Guangdong, gathered in Guangzhou, held the so-called extraordinary meeting, and organized the so-called National Government. At this point, the Central Standing Committee believes that the actions of this reactionary group have violated the will of the people of the whole country, endangered the foundation of peace and unification, and hindered the suppression of the Red bandits. On May 30, the Central Executive Committee gave sincere advice to the comrades in Guangdong. At the same time, on June 1, a declaration was issued, painfully stating that the biggest disaster facing China at present is the Red bandits, and the only responsibility of the government is to suppress the bandits. Regarding the Guangdong incident, we insisted on leniency, hoping that they would wake up. Now Comrade Chiang himself is personally supervising the army to suppress the bandits. The survival of the Party and the country depends on this situation. Therefore, we briefly describe the situation and the central government's determination to maintain peace and focus on suppressing the bandits, and submit it to the Congress for discussion and resolution.</p>
<p>(B) National United Effort to Suppress the Red Bandits. Since the Fourth Plenary Session resolved to eradicate the Communists and suppress the bandits as the top priority of this year's policy guidelines, the Standing Committee has urged the National Government to actively implement it. In the past few months, the work of suppressing the bandits has been progressing day by day. Jiangxi Province is the area where banditry is most rampant. Since the encirclement and suppression, its momentum has also been decreasing day by day. However, the bandits are cunning, coerce the people, rely on dangers, and appear and disappear frequently. It is necessary to properly formulate a plan and encircle them step by step in order to wipe them out completely and eliminate their roots forever. Recently, the National Assembly convened in the capital and accepted the National Government's report on eradicating the Red bandits, and made a very detailed resolution. Our Party takes solving the people's difficulties as its responsibility, and should do its best to eliminate this greatest disaster for the nation. The Standing Committee specially announced to the people of the country the meaning of focusing on suppressing the Red bandits with all our strength. Even if there are unexpected setbacks, we will never be discouraged. However, we silently observe that the hidden and widespread nature of the Red bandits is different from ordinary skin diseases. If the comrades of our Party do not confirm that this matter is the only task of the current revolution, and the whole body is in the front of the people, and the governments at all levels work together with one heart and respond from top to bottom, washing away the past scattered and bystander habits, then the work of suppressing bandits and eradicating the Red bandits will not be easy to achieve quickly. Especially if the people of the whole country do not know that if this disaster is not eliminated, the country will not be able to stand and the people will not be able to live, and with the greatest determination, make a concerted effort, it will not be enough to eliminate the roots of the Red disaster and quell the great robbery of the roving bandits. The Standing Committee observes the recent situation of the bandits, and based on the progress of the bandit suppression work, it intends to request the Plenary Session to formulate the main points of the work, instruct all party members to know what to work hard for, and at the same time urge the government to instruct administrative personnel at all levels to quickly rejuvenate and earnestly take responsibility, and in the name of the Plenary Session, widely announce to the people and awaken their determination to save and defend themselves, and rise up together and cooperate to fundamentally eradicate the bandit disaster in the shortest possible time, so as to lay the foundation for the people's livelihood and stabilize the foundation of the country. Whether it is appropriate, please wait for public resolution. (Special dispatch on the 13th)</p>

<h3 id="e17">Further Discussion on Uchida's Succession as President of the South Manchuria Railway <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>This time, Count Yasuya Uchida of Japan succeeded as the president of the South Manchuria Railway. It is said that after the recent Sino-Japanese railway conference, the Japanese have greatly promoted the plan for the development of Manchuria and Mongolia with the South Manchuria Railway as the center. The Japanese living in the Northeast of our country strongly advocate the so-called autonomous alliance to maintain the rights and interests of the empire and develop the Japanese nation in Manchuria. The veteran faction in Tokyo strongly advocates the independence of the South Manchuria Railway to give it the power to decide on policies. The autonomous and independent theories echo each other, and the overseas Chinese businessmen and the veteran faction encourage each other. The purpose is to develop Manchuria and Mongolia urgently, so they oppose the weak diplomacy of Foreign Minister Kijūrō Shidehara. They are also afraid that the government's diplomacy will be weak and make concessions in the South Manchuria Railway negotiations, so there is this autonomous and independent movement. What they call autonomy and independence is not really free from government control, but they want their policies not to change with the change of government. In fact, they want to use the South Manchuria Railway to manipulate the power to manage Manchuria and Mongolia. This kind of activity of the Japanese has prompted the government to pay considerable attention. Therefore, the selection of successors this time is very serious. Yesterday, the news agency said that the Japanese government believes that the relationship of the South Manchuria Railway is important, and there must be a great figure with diplomatic skills to avoid the past evils of shifting with the change of the cabinet. From this point of view, the Japanese government has already accepted the proposition of autonomy and independence. However, I don't know if Mr. Uchida will still adhere to the past policy of Shidehara to run the South Manchuria Railway, or follow the strong policy of the Japanese to run the South Manchuria Railway. This is a matter of great relationship with the future of diplomacy.</p>
<h3 id="e18">Domestic Urgent Telegrams <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>To Mr. Chen Mingshu, Mr. Xu Ruwei, Mr. Zou Haibin, and brothers Bo Nan, Hui Chang, Chou Shuo, Wo Qi, Han Ping, Qin Fu, Ding Zhong, and Qing Yun,</p>
<p>I have received all your telegrams from previous days. Since the Hu case occurred, the comrades in Guangdong have been aroused with great vigor. I, as the head of the government, am deeply worried that this will lead to a major change. Whenever the masses are clamoring, I have always wanted to stay away from these matters and no longer hear about state affairs. However, considering that unification has just been achieved, the people's livelihood is declining, the foundation of the country is not yet stable, the people's minds are confused, the common disaster is imminent, and the nation's fate is hanging by a thread, this is truly a time when there is no time to save the dying. If we can quell this strange disaster and save the nation's destiny, then the internal disputes within the party can certainly be discussed and negotiated openly. If not, a moment of anger, using it as an excuse to start a war, will affect the whole situation. If we are divided and ruled separately, the communists will take advantage of it. What a terrible prospect for the future of the country! Those with foresight all say so. Therefore, every time I talk with the generals of the Eighth Route Army, I always base my words on this principle, secretly coordinating and harmonizing. Gradually, I saw that public sentiment was trending towards reconciliation. The generals of the Nineteenth Route Army also jointly telegraphed the central government and Bo Nan, opposing internal strife and focusing on dealing with the communists. Thereupon, I felt relieved and went on an inspection tour of various counties. Unexpectedly, Bo Nan and others sent messengers everywhere, exaggerating the situation and deceiving people, creating a situation that was bound to lead to action. I received the report and hurriedly returned to the province, but the arrow was already on the string and could not be stopped. Alas, how sad! To hasten the country's fate towards danger and create an irreparable situation, how can those who advocate revolution truly bear to do this? At this time, I have no way to save the situation and I feel unspeakable pain. Therefore, I still have no choice but to leave. This is the reason and the process of my departure from Guangdong. Now, you all give me earnest advice, and your intention is to have Chiang Kai-shek step down. The ancients said, "One should demand of others only what one has oneself, and criticize others only when one does not have it oneself." I ask, even if Chiang Kai-shek steps down, what method do you have to unify the situation and eliminate the chaos? Everyone in the world can see through it clearly and knows that you cannot do it. This is something you do not have yourselves, yet you demand it of others. Furthermore, I ask, with the motley crew and situation you have gathered together, what method do you have to achieve the true democratic government of our party? This is also something that people all over the world can criticize you for not being able to do. This is something you cannot do yourselves, yet you criticize others. If unification is impossible and the chaos becomes even worse, and you say that only when Chiang Kai-shek leaves can you suppress the communists, even a three-year-old child cannot be deceived. Do you think that the communists only rose up for Chiang Kai-shek? Now, the communists are indeed advocating that they welcome you to oppose Chiang Kai-shek and cooperate with you. Do you think that the communists do not want China to suffer until the disaster is upon them? Why not come to the front line and take a look? Even a heartless person would return in despair. All these theories and facts are clear in the minds of the people of the whole country. I have no subjective bias and am not interfering in any way. Please use your own conscience and wisdom to question yourselves. I need not say more. I am humbly among the ranks of revolutionary men. In my conduct and actions, what I have contributed to the party and the country can be witnessed by heaven and earth and questioned by ghosts and gods. At this time, I am exploring various objective ways to save the country from disaster with clear understanding like watching a fire, and my will is as firm as gold and stone. I am about to lead my old troops and personally go to the communist dens, vowing to decide the final fate with the communist party. If I am not successful, I will collect my bones between Zhang and Gong. As for the two years I was in charge of Guangdong's administration, all my aspirations were thwarted. Looking back on everything, they have all become my sins. Even if the people of Guangdong do not blame me, what face do I have to see them? Fortunately, if I have a day left with my remaining strength, I would rather be exiled to the border than sit and watch the division of the party and the infighting among comrades. If we can abandon hatred and love and worry about the country's demise together, and if it is not too late to make amends, then on the day the communists are defeated, I will lower my head and submit, and I will be willing to be your servants. I am baring my heart. Please understand. Sincerely, Chen Mingshu respectfully bows with his true seal.</p>

<p>(Jinan) Han Fuqu, Ma Hongyuan, Sun Tongxuan, Cao Fulin, Qiao Lizhi, Gu Liangmin, and others replied to Chiang's telegram, stating, "After reading your telegram, anyone with blood and qi would be moved to tears. Since we have followed you, we have long vowed to exhaust our meager efforts to repay your great kindness. Now, you have instructed us to eliminate internal strife, safeguard unity, suppress the Red bandits, and stabilize society, which is a critical juncture for the survival of the party and the country. We should stand by each other in adversity and make every effort to follow your instructions to relieve your worries day and night. State affairs are the common affairs of all the people of the country, not just your affairs. Since you do not avoid difficulties and resentments and advocate for the whole country, who is not a stone-hearted person who would vow to fight to the death and be loyal to the country? Wherever the banner points, the red flames will disappear immediately. The south is hot and humid, please remain calm and do not overwork." (Special telegram on the 13th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Zuoxiang, Wan Fulin, and Tang Yulin telegraphed Chiang, saying, "The disaster of the Red bandits is fiercer than a flood.

However, we are bound by our duties and cannot avoid troubling you to personally take command. Reflecting on this, we feel ashamed. We only hope that your mighty bow will quell the flames of war, capture the leaders, and sweep away the bandits, bringing peace to the people and solidifying the foundation of the country.

<p>Difficulties in Cash Conversion of the Boxer Indemnity</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Huai River Conservancy estimates that the cost of the first phase of the project is 50 million. The total amount of British Boxer Indemnity funds available in accumulated and unmatured installments is approximately 30 million yuan at current market prices. The amounts due from the Russian and Italian Boxer Indemnities are approximately the same. The Russian funds have already been paid for education expenses, and the Italian funds have not yet been paid. Of the 30 million in British funds, only 10 million in cash is available for material expenses. The Italian funds are also stipulated in this way. The Huai River Conservancy has appointed Committee Members Chen Qicai and Chen Guanghui to contact the Shanghai business community to discuss ways to transfer these material expenses. The Shanghai business community will pay the Huai River Conservancy in cash, and the Huai River Conservancy will use the Boxer Indemnity funds to purchase goods. However, there are many difficulties. Currently, the latest world machinery products are made in the United States, and the cheapest prices are in Germany. The products of British machines, other than spinning machines, are inferior. Merchants are unwilling to purchase and sell these products, so the transfer of cash is also being affected. The Conservancy plans to petition the government to find ways to raise cash to avoid hindering the project. Chen Shutang, the current captain of the Conservancy's engineering team, is leading the engineers to depart from Beijing on the 15th for the middle and upper reaches of the Huai River to survey the waterways and dam projects. It is expected to be completed in one or two months. (Special telegram on the 13th)</p>

<p>Emergency Decree</p>
<p>Party Leaders Convene Parliament to Resolve Issues</p>
<p>Cabinet Reorganization</p>
<p>President Hindenburg Disapproves</p>
<p>Budget Deficit is Enormous</p>
<p>Foreign Currency Rapidly Being Purchased on the Market</p>
<p>Berlin, 13th (National News Agency) - German Chancellor Brüning went to East Prussia to meet with the President and report on his trip to England and the domestic political situation. He returned to Nanjing today and stated that the President fully supports the Cabinet's position, will not reorganize the Cabinet, and will not allow the convening of Parliament. Therefore, the political situation must be considered extremely serious.</p>
<p>Berlin, 12th (Reuters) - The People's Party has requested that Parliament be convened in the middle of next week to discuss the emergency decree promulgated last Saturday. If necessary, it should be amended or abolished. This is why the German political crisis has suddenly occurred. The National People's Party also advocates convening Parliament. Therefore, if the government's current proposal not to convene Parliament is not taken seriously, the Cabinet will definitely have to resign. The key to controlling the situation is the Social Democratic Party. If the German Chancellor does not revise the unacceptable provisions of the emergency decree as deemed by the Party, the Social Democratic Party will also join other parties in demanding the convening of Parliament. The government is currently hoping for a compromise between the government and the Social Democratic Party. The People's Party's aim is clearly to force the government to reorganize, especially to remove its party member Kurtz and replace him with someone with stronger tactics. It is reported that the person the People's Party has in mind is the current Ambassador to England, Neurath. Today, the authorities announced that the German budget for the year ending at the end of March is short by approximately 64.5 million pounds. The purpose of the currently opposed emergency decree is to prevent Germany from going bankrupt.</p>
<p>Berlin, 12th (Reuters) - The scramble for foreign currency from all walks of life is a disturbing aspect of the current tense situation, leading to a shortage of US dollar bills in banks. The Exchange Committee has decided to issue New York checks that can be exchanged for bank bills within half a month. It has been found that in the past few days, approximately 7 million pounds worth of cash has been transported to London.</p>

<p>London, 12th (Reuters) - Labor Party cabinet members and key figures from the Liberal Party met at the Prime Minister's residence today in an attempt to avert the crisis caused by the Liberal Party's proposed amendment to the land tax on Tuesday, which led to the government's defeat. Liberal Party leader George, realizing that the matter had reached a dangerous level, rushed back to London from Scotland yesterday and immediately held a round table meeting with other key figures and cabinet members. The frank discussions between the leaders of the two parties have gradually calmed the political crisis. It is now heard that there has been progress in the talks. The Liberal Party will hold a general meeting on Monday to make a final decision on the amendment.</p>

<p>Official Appointment Announced</p>
<p>Japanese Government Attaches Importance to South Manchurian Diplomacy</p>
<p>Tokyo Newspapers Deeply Rejoice at the Selection of a Capable Person</p>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Reuters) - The appointments of Yasuya Uchida as President of the South Manchuria Railway and Sadajo Eguchi as Vice President have now been officially announced. Eguchi has long served at Mitsubishi Corporation, having been its bank manager and later deputy director of the general affairs department of the head office. It is expected that the affairs of the South Manchuria Railway will be managed by Eguchi, while Uchida will focus on broad policies.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Reuters) - Major Japanese newspapers unanimously praised the government's appointment of Uchida as President of the South Manchuria Railway as a success. The government's appointment of a politician from the opposition party to this important position, regardless of party affiliation, has set an unprecedented example. Newspapers especially praise it. Uchida has served as Foreign Minister three times and has been the Ambassador to the United States, enjoying international renown. The government's appointment of him as President of the South Manchuria Railway shows its importance to South Manchurian diplomatic relations. As the Manchurian problem is very complex, the government has chosen a highly capable person to handle it, regardless of party affiliation. The Kokumin Shimbun also strongly advocates consolidating the position of the Japanese in Manchuria and establishing a buffer zone to ensure peace in the Far East.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Denchu) - Today, Uchida told reporters who visited him, "I have no experience with railways, so I must work hard from now on. In the past, there was so-called triple diplomacy and quadruple diplomacy in Manchuria. Generally speaking, opinions differ due to different positions. In short, as long as China and Japan can understand each other, the issue can be resolved satisfactorily. I have not yet decided when I will take office, but I plan to take office as soon as possible."</p>

<p>Authorities Dispatch Troops to Suppress</p>
<p>Roubaix, France, 13th (Reuters) - Yesterday, strikers and police clashed here. The strikers were all cotton mill workers. Because the police prohibited them from gathering to demonstrate, they threw stones at the police. The authorities dispatched troops to assist the police, but the soldiers were also pelted with stones. One military officer and one police driver were seriously injured. The troublemakers placed obstacles in the streets. The soldiers and police retreated. The authorities have now deployed guard posts in the riot area.</p>
<p>Roubaix, 13th (Reuters) - The rioters have quietly dispersed this morning. Everything is now quiet. However, the authorities have tightened security. Several rioters, incited by Communists, erected red flags on the obstacles and strung wire across the road. A notice was written in chalk, stating, "This is the boundary of the people. Trespassers will be punished." Kerosene was poured all over the road, apparently intending to set the police on fire when they crossed the obstacles.</p>

<h3 id="e77">He Jian Goes to Hengyang for Inspection and Will Return to the Province <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Cables Chiang Kai-shek Expressing Support and Inviting Him to Hunan</p>
<p>No Signs of Guizhou and Guangdong Troops Invading Hunan</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Recently, there have been no signs of Guizhou and Guangdong troops invading Hunan. According to reports received by He Jian, the main force of the Guangdong army is now concentrated in the Dongjiang area. The Guangdong army in Shaoguan is still strictly guarding and has not moved. Most of the Guizhou army is now concentrated in Liuzhou and is moving towards Wuzhou. Xia Wei has been appointed as the Director of the Wuzhou Forward Command in Guizhou, but there has been no action yet. He Jian took this opportunity to travel by car to Hengyang on the morning of the 11th to inspect the fortress and deploy defenses. He is scheduled to return to the province on the 13th. He Jian also sent a telegram expressing his sincere support for Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek the day before he left for Hengyang, saying, "To Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek of the National Revolutionary Army, Navy, and Air Force: The scourge of the Red bandits is spreading, causing national unrest. The dying people are eagerly awaiting rescue. Since the sudden changes in Guangdong, there is widespread fear that the banditry will spread further, causing panic and anxiety. Fortunately, our central government has repeatedly declared its determination to fully suppress the bandits, and your Excellency published a proclamation to the officers and soldiers of the entire nation, clearly indicating the purpose of eliminating internal strife, ensuring unification, suppressing the Red bandits, and ensuring the safety of society. The people of the whole country have suddenly found a way to escape death and enter life, and are grateful to the point of weeping. Your Excellency works diligently day and night, fully embodying benevolence and love for the people. Your virtue and prestige will spread, and the flames of banditry will be extinguished. This is not only the fortune of the Party and the nation, but also an immortal achievement for all generations. This office respectfully leads the 30 million people of Hunan in wholeheartedly supporting you and respectfully welcomes Your Excellency to Hunan to oversee the suppression of the bandits and bring rain to the people. We are immensely hopeful. This telegram is respectfully submitted, and we implore your wise consideration. Respectfully submitted by He Jian, Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Government, and all members of the committee." In addition to sending a telegram expressing support for the central government, He Jian also specifically sent Song Hekeng, Director of the Department of Construction, to Hankou on the Xiang-E Express at 4 PM on the 10th, to transfer to Nanjing and explain Hunan Province's sincere support for the central government to the central government.</p>
<p>As for the Guangdong and Guizhou troops, He Jian has cabled the county magistrates of each county bordering Guangdong and Guizhou to report the situation daily, and has sent a large number of field officers familiar with the situation in Guangdong and Guizhou to scout the Hunan border. Reports received from all parties in recent days indicate that there are no large numbers of Guizhou troops in the Longsheng to Guilin area. Guizhou troops are observing the terrain and constructing fortifications at Longhuguan, appearing to be on the defensive against Hunan. As for the Guangdong troops, there are no concrete plans to send troops to Hunan. It can be seen that the situation on the Hunan border is not very tense. Attached are reports from various parties, as follows:</p>
<p>Situation of the Guizhou Troops: (1) General Commander Xie Xiaoguan Cheng sent a telegram from Yongzhou saying that Guizhou troops are currently observing the terrain in the Longhuguan area, appearing to be deploying defenses. The Guilin area is still stationed with local militia, and no additional troops have been added. However, the First Army is recruiting soldiers in Quanzhou and Guilin. The Hunan border is as peaceful as ever. (2) General Headquarters Bai Xiaoguan Xuan sent a telegram from Dong'an saying that Tan Lian's Guizhou Teaching Regiment has arrived at Longhuguan to scout the terrain and build defensive fortifications. Recruitment notices have been posted in Ping, Gong, Quan, and Guan counties in Guizhou for the past week, but there are not many recruits. (3) Yongming County Magistrate Tang Mengren sent a telegram saying that according to reports, Chen's Regiment of Guizhou troops, with about a battalion of riflemen, went to Longhuguan from Gongcheng to inspect the terrain, and the next morning turned to patrol the Fuchuan and He counties. The border of our county is still peaceful. (4) Suining County Magistrate Nie Jikang Yu sent a telegram saying that he received a telegram from Zhang Liangji, Commander of Baoqing, stating that according to Jiang Tiesheng (Commander of the Quanxing Garrison), the main force of the Guizhou army is concentrated in Longsheng, planning to invade Suining, Jingxian, Chengbu, Wugang, and other counties. The county magistrates are instructed to supervise the militia to take serious precautions. He immediately sent scouts to investigate and found that only the militia command was stationed in Longsheng, with two teams of regular troops. There is no large force of Guizhou troops concentrated there. Only a small number of Han Caihui's troops are stationed in Guilin, and a portion of them have mutinied and fled to Sanjiang. Further details will be investigated.</p>
<p>Situation of the Guangdong Troops: (1) Chenxian County Magistrate Zhong Yuying sent a telegram saying that Li Yangjing's troops are stationed in Shaoguan, and there are no large armies stationed in the Lechang Pingshi area. However, there is a lot of forced labor, and merchants are reluctant to travel. According to reports, the Guangzhou puppet government wants to collude with Northwest warlords to respond, and has sent Ye Qi to persuade them. The Chenyi border is peaceful. (2) Jianghua County Magistrate Liu Bingding sent a telegram saying that Guangdong authorities still have no concrete plans to send troops. Lianzhou is still defended by Deng Hui's regiment, and there have been no changes. At Mashi, 120 li from the county seat, a Guo has been ordered by Chen of Guangdong to establish an organization and recruit troops across the border. The office sent the first team of regular troops to drive them away. Guo fled upon hearing the news, and there were no other issues. (11th)</p>

<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>to leave Hankou for Nanjing. The pilot was Yan Yuzong, captain of the First Aviation Team. According to He's telegram, he arrived safely that day. It is said that He's trip to Nanjing, in addition to attending the Fifth Plenary Session, also carries a new plan for the suppression of bandits in Hubei Province, which will be presented to Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek for review and approval, so that it can be effectively implemented after returning to Hankou. Since the Red bandits in Hubei Province have been severely suppressed by various armies, most of them have already been wiped out. Recently, the remnants of Kuang Jixun's bandits have fled to eastern Hubei, and the remnants of He Long's bandits have fled to northern Hubei. The Jiangxi bandits have disturbed southern Hubei, hoping to revive their forces. When He was in Hankou, he ordered various troops to be responsible for the suppression. As a result of the efforts of various armies, He's bandits have been trapped in the Wudang Mountains in Yunxian, Kuang's bandits have been trapped in the northeast of Huang'an, and the Jiangxi bandits who fled across the border have also been severely damaged in the Longyan Hengbao area and have fled to Chuanbu. Now He has formulated a new plan based on the recent situation, hoping to wipe them out in one fell swoop. The content of the plan, due to military secrets, is not convenient to announce.

<p>Plans to Inspect Xingguo and Return to Nanjing</p>
<p>Chen Mingshu's return to China from Japan this time was kept secret, and few people outside knew about it. According to a certain important person from Nanchang who came to Nanjing, Chen Mingshu arrived in Shanghai from Japan on May 31. After receiving the news of Chen's arrival in Shanghai, Nanjing sent a military aircraft to Shanghai to pick him up. Chen boarded the military aircraft and arrived in Nanjing at 10 AM on the 5th of this month. He stayed at the headquarters and had a long and cordial conversation with Chairman Chiang. On the 6th, he took a military aircraft from Nanjing to Jiujiang. He originally planned to transfer to Nanchang, but due to heavy rain, Chen stayed in Jiujiang and visited Lushan. On the morning of the 7th, he changed to the Hankou aircraft of the airline company and flew to Nanchang. Upon hearing the news, He Yingqin and Lu Dipin specially led the provincial government military band to the airport to welcome him. After Chen got off the plane, he went to the headquarters with He and Lu for a pleasant conversation. On the morning of the 9th, he took the same aircraft from Nanchang to Ganzhou. The Nanchang Headquarters also sent a military aircraft to guide the aircraft Chen was on. At 11:20 AM on the 9th, he arrived safely in Ganzhou.</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Chen Mingshu, carrying Chairman Chiang's order, arrived in Ganzhou from Nanjing to comfort the officers and soldiers of the 17th Route Army.

<p>Denies Discussing the Issue of Shipments to Shi Yousan's Troops</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Shao Lizhi, Secretary-General of the Commander-in-Chief's Office, recently came to Jinan. I recently visited Shao at the Jiaoji Hotel and obtained the following remarks from him: (Question) Has Shi Yousan sent any telegrams recently? (Answer) Shi sent a telegram to Chairman Han. I have not received his telegram. The general meaning of the telegram to Han is that he takes Han's position as his position, and his support for the central government's peaceful unification is consistent. (Question) Has the issue of shipments to Shi Yousan's troops been resolved? (Answer) The issue of shipments to Shi Yousan's troops has been discussed and decided with Chairman Chiang when Deputy Commander Zhang was in Nanjing. I don't know and don't care. The report that I came to Jinan to resolve the issue of shipments to Shi Yousan's troops with Chairman Han is completely wrong. (Question) Is there a date for Shi to send a representative to Jinan? (Answer) Although Shi said in the telegram that he would send a representative, he has not arrived yet. (Question) What is the news from Guangdong in the last two days? (Answer) I am in Jinan and have not received a report. I don't know the details, but it can be asserted that there is no major problem. Shao also solemnly stated that he only holds the title of Secretary-General of the Headquarters, and all matters are handled by the Chief of Staff. He has no major responsibilities in the Headquarters. This trip to Jinan is even less important. The outside world believes that he came to Jinan with a major mission, which is due to outsiders' ignorance and conjecture. Finally, the reporter asked if Ma Hongkui would take office as Chairman of Ningxia. Shao replied that he will eventually go, but the date cannot be determined yet.</p>
<p>Also, this morning (11th), the Pingpu 201st train arrived in Jinan from Ping. Xiao Xiangge, the former division commander of the Northwest Army, was on the train. Jinan Mayor Wen Chenglie met with him on the train. It is said that Xiao is going to Nanjing on behalf of the Northwest Army to meet with Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek. Liu Yufen, Chief Counselor of the Commander-in-Chief's Office, also traveled with Xiao. (11th)</p>

<p>Hai Tao, Chief Counselor of the Fifteenth Route Army, Comes Along</p>
<p>Cheng Says Shi's Illness Has Not Healed, Cannot Come to Jinan</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Cheng Xixian, the representative of Shi Yousan, Commander-in-Chief of the Thirteenth Route Army (Commander of the Thirteenth Route Army Teaching Division), arrived in Jinan at 9:05 PM tonight (11th) on the first train of the Jinpu Railway after passing through Shunde from Tianjin. Hai Tao, Chief Counselor of the Fifteenth Route Army Headquarters, came along. Jinan Mayor Wen Chenglie and others welcomed them at the station. According to Cheng's remarks to reporters at the station, there is nothing else going on in Shunde. The outside rumors are unexpected. Recently, when Committee Member Shao came to Jinan, Chairman Han telegraphed Commander-in-Chief Shi, asking him to meet in Jinan. Commander-in-Chief Shi could not go to Tianjin either because his stomach illness has not healed, and Deputy Commander Zhang asked him to go to Beiping. He could not come to Jinan either. He first telegraphed Han to ask if he could send Xixian to Jinan. Han telegraphed his permission, so Xixian came to Jinan. Cheng then went to the municipal government with Wen Chenglie to rest and stayed there. According to Hai, he was ordered to go to Beiping from Tai'an to celebrate the birthday of Deputy Commander Zhang. After the matter was over, he went to Shunde by the way. The situation in Shunde is very peaceful. Zhang Xuecheng is also there. Shi's army's monthly salary is 400,000, which is allocated by Deputy Commander Zhang on a monthly basis.

<p>The entire mine has three coal shafts, so-called, which are the paths for extracting coal and the routes for coal miners to enter and exit. No. 1 shaft is located in the southern part of the mining area, excavated in the 28th year of the Guangxu reign, and converted from a rectangular shape to a circular shape in the 3rd year of the Republic of China. It was renovated once in the 7th year of the Republic of China, with a depth of 184 meters. Each time, it hoists 1.3 tons of coal, and 600 tons every eight hours. The coal from the first layer underground is transported out from this shaft, but the coal mining area of the first layer is gradually shrinking, and the transportation route for coal from other layers is too far. Based on the current situation, its coal transportation lifespan is no more than five or six years. No. 2 shaft was excavated in the 30th year of the Guangxu reign, in the northern part of the mining area, 400 meters from No. 1 shaft. Initially, it was used to extract the coal from the first and second layers, and later, for ventilation, it was excavated to a depth of 184 meters. The shaft opening is circular, and each time it hoists 1.3 tons of coal, and 800 tons every eight hours. Currently, the coal from the second and third layers underground is extracted from this shaft. The entire mine's drainage and air outlet also utilize this shaft, but the shaft is not straight, which not only wastes materials but also often causes danger. It is now planned to stop coal extraction from this shaft and use it exclusively for workers to go up and down, as well as for drainage and air outlet. No. 3 shaft is located in the northwestern part of the mining area, 1,740 meters from No. 1 shaft and 1,520 meters from No. 2 shaft. It was excavated in the 13th year of the Republic of China and completed in the 18th year of the Republic of China. This shaft has the best construction, with a depth of 250 meters. A 1,000 cubic meter long reservoir was excavated underground, and a new 1,600 meter long reservoir was excavated in the fifth layer of the tunnel. This shaft is equipped with a large water pump (pronounced as 'pound', i.e., a water pump), which can pump 3,000 liters of water per minute. The coal extracted from the fourth layer, which used to be transported by No. 2 shaft, has now been changed to be transported by the North Shaft, which can hoist 1,300 tons of coal every eight hours. The coal transportation railways all lead directly to the shaft openings. The underground coal mining methods are roughly divided into three types: one is the room and pillar method, the second is the natural caving method, and the third is the backfilling method. The room and pillar method is the most common method for coal mining. Although the natural caving method saves labor and is efficient, it often causes injuries due to caving, and a lot of coal is discarded as it falls with stones. The backfilling method is now being used.</p>
<p>The entire mine's machine motive power is divided into three locations. The hourly steam production of the boilers is 17,000 kilos. There are four generators with a capacity of 394 K·V·A. The important machine parts are as follows: (A) Seven winches, located in various places underground and on the ground, with three types: steam-powered, electric-powered, and compressed air-powered, depending on the location where they are installed. No. 1, 2, and 3 shafts and the winch rooms each have a steam-powered winch, specifically for hoisting coal, lowering materials, and for workers to go up and down. The first layer material road, the third layer dark shaft, and the fourth layer dark shaft underground each have a compressed air-powered winch, used to transport coal to the 184-meter-deep level tunnel, and then transported out of the shaft opening by the ground winch. (B) Water pumps. Two horizontal water pumps are installed in the tunnel 184 meters from the ground to discharge water directly to the ground. Each pump operates for 22 hours per day. One vertical water pump discharges the water from the bottom of the well to the tunnel 132 meters from the ground, and then a horizontal water pump continues to discharge it to the ground, operating for five hours per day every day. Last year, a double steam-powered horizontal pump was added at the lowest point of 254 meters underground. This machine pumps 3,000 liters of water per minute. (C) Ventilation equipment. There are two old exhaust fans, one with an exhaust capacity of two cubic meters per minute, and another with 800 cubic meters per minute. A new 180,000 cubic foot fan and a 450-horsepower steam engine have also been installed. No. 1 shaft has nine boilers, No. 2 shaft has eleven boilers, and No. 3 shaft has four boilers. More than 300 electric lights are installed underground, and more than 1,700 are installed on the ground. Three telephones are installed underground, and 32 are installed on the ground.</p>
<p>The entire factory is divided into two main sections. One section specializes in repairs, and simple manufacturing is also done occasionally. The other section manages the use and maintenance of various machines, such as coal extraction and transportation. The existing machine tools include only seven lathes, two planers, two drilling machines, one iron sawing machine, two wood sawing machines, one wood lathe, one mechanical forging hammer, one wood planing machine, and one iron rolling machine. The work in the factory is roughly divided into four categories: 1. Smelting and casting (mold making, sand casting, etc.); 2. Cold metalworking (filing, lathing, planing, riveting, cutting, piercing, drilling, flattening, rolling, etc.); 3. Hot metalworking (forging, casting, etc.); 4. Woodworking (all kinds of wood materials, tools, etc.). According to Secretary Su Changgeng, who visited the mining area, the various equipment in the wood mine is relatively complete, but the lack of drinking water facilities underground is a shortcoming. The summer season is approaching, and the workers are sweating profusely. The daily demand for drinking water has increased sharply compared to the winter. If water cans are transported by manpower, it is difficult to supply them adequately. Director Fu pays close attention to this and has decided to install drinking water pipes underground to provide workers with sufficient drinking water. (To be continued)</p>

It was decided that Li Boxing's Great Road and Great Garden would be used as the park site, and engineering commissioners Zhang Zhongfu, Duan Tianzhen, and others, five in total, were appointed to be responsible for the preparation.</p>
<p>Businesses have repeatedly objected to the issue of affixing stamps to the bills for the three festivals. Recently, the Stamp Tax Bureau still strictly ordered stamps to be affixed to the bills, otherwise, penalties would be imposed. The County Chamber of Commerce believes that the bills are of a notification nature, and very few payments are received immediately after a bill is issued. If stamps are affixed every time, it would be a double tax, which is contrary to the constitution. Therefore, it has sent a circular to all guilds to unanimously oppose it. (12th)</p>

<p>Citizens petition for drinking water. Recently, County Magistrate Song Wei has been constructing cement and steel bridges at Zhugan Huidongwai and other places. Zhu Bingji contracted the project from the Construction Bureau through bidding. However, to seek convenience for his own work, he cut off the river channels at the bridge construction sites. People objected at the time, but he ignored them. In recent days, the water flow has been blocked, and the river water smells foul. Citizens believe that the bridge construction will take time, and if the dams are not removed and the flow allowed, epidemics are feared. On the morning of the 13th, dozens of citizens went to the county government with banners to petition. County Magistrate Jin summoned the heads of the Construction and Public Security Bureaus and ordered the contractor to quickly remove one-third of the dam. The contractor agreed to do so, and the citizens were satisfied and left.</p>

<p>Sea bandits kidnap and murder. Xujialu Town in the northern part of the county borders the sea to the east and Baoshan County to the west. At about 9:00 PM on the 10th, more than a dozen sea bandits suddenly arrived, each armed with pistols and Mauser pistols. They first robbed Huang Tongchang's general merchandise store of more than 400 yuan. Then, they went to Xia Changshun's fish store and kidnapped the owner Xia Hanglin and the shop assistant Cai Genbao. At the same time, they fired shots to show their power, intending to loot the store. At that time, the Public Security First Branch stationed in Gu Town (about four li from Xu Town) happened to dispatch two patrol officers to patrol near the town. They suddenly heard gunshots and stopped and fired into the air. The bandits heard the sound and fled in all directions. However, Zhou Tulin, the owner of the Zhou Xiesheng butcher shop in the town, had a five-shot pistol at home. Hearing that the bandits were fleeing, he chased after them with the gun and fired at the bandits. The bandits turned around and returned fire. He was shot in the left leg and fell to the ground. The bandits jumped forward, snatched the gun, and beat him severely with the gun butt, then threw it into the river. He died instantly. The bandits then went into the butcher shop and kidnapped the clerk Chen A'mao and fled with shouts. By the time the detectives arrived, the bandits were far away. The body of Zhou Tulin, who was shot and killed by the bandits, was fished out of the river. His body was covered with scars, a truly tragic sight. On the 12th, County Magistrate Tu, along with Examining Officer Huang, went to the countryside to examine the scene. As for the fish shop owner Xia Hanglin and the other three kidnapped, there has been no news to this day.</p>

<p>County clerk commits adultery with a maid. Peng Gengzi, a clerk at the County Middle School, had a love affair with a maid named Wu Erbao and lived together. In June of last year, she gave birth to a boy. On December 15th, Wu Erbao's uncle, Chen Bingchu, because Erbao's original spouse was surnamed Bian, planned to hold a wedding. So, Chen's wife, along with Erbao's mother, Wu Xue, went to Peng's house and dragged Erbao away. Peng Gengzi then filed a lawsuit with the local court, accusing Chen Bingchu and others of obstructing freedom. The criminal court judge Wang Dawei presided over the trial and ruled that Chen Bingchu and others were not guilty. However, the prosecutor disagreed with the ruling and appealed to the High Court. Yesterday (13th), Judge Zhao of the Second Criminal Court held a hearing. The plaintiff, Peng Gengzi, was ill and did not attend. Only Wu Erbao testified in court, stating that her mother and uncle did indeed obstruct her freedom. Subsequently, Prosecutor Sun Xiheng made his arguments. The trial concluded, and the verdict is scheduled to be announced on the 18th of this month.</p>
<p>Detective team captures abductor. Shen Mingbao, the seven-year-old daughter of Shen Xiao'si, a tea boy at the Suzhou Orphanage, was abducted by abductors Yin A'san, Qian Yin, etc. in February of this year and sold to the Zhu family in Runyu Lane, Lao Laji Bridge, Shanghai, for thirty yuan. Later, Shen Xiao'si received a letter and reported it to the detective team for investigation. A relative of Shen Xiao'si named Qian A'wu was captured and sentenced by the local court to one year and two months in prison.

They were immediately taken to the bureau and transferred to the local court for investigation.</p>
<p>Measures to eliminate lake bandits. The Wu County government previously planned to work with the water and land police to first eliminate the bandit lairs in Tian Da Tan, Da Fu Dun, Xin Kai Lu, Shen Jia Lu, and other places in Taihu Lake, and then thoroughly investigate the straw shed tenants along the lake, and formulate strict measures to eliminate banditry. After reporting this to the Civil Affairs Department for approval, an instruction was received yesterday stating that the plan was essential and should be discussed and implemented conscientiously, and detailed rules for cracking down on the lakeside tenants should be drafted and submitted for review.</p>

<p>Jiangsu Provincial Water Police to be reorganized. The news of the reorganization of the Jiangsu Provincial Water Public Security has been circulating for a long time. Now, we have received confirmation that the Civil Affairs Department has decided to reorganize the six water police districts in the province into three branch bureaus, with a general bureau to oversee everything. The plan is as follows: 1. The original first and fourth districts will be merged into the first branch bureau, with the bureau headquarters located in Wusong. The current chief of the first district, Xu Pu Cheng, will be appointed as the branch bureau chief. 2. Wuxi's second district and Suzhou's third district will be merged and reorganized into the second branch bureau, with the bureau headquarters located in Suzhou. The current chiefs of the second and third districts, Shen Gao Chen, will be appointed as the branch bureau chief. 3. The fifth and sixth districts will be merged and reorganized into the third branch bureau. The current chief of the sixth district, Cheng Zhuang, will be appointed as the branch bureau chief. The general bureau will be located in Minhang, Shanghai, and Jiang Chao Xiong has been appointed as the bureau chief. This plan has been decided to be implemented on July 1st. After the reorganization, it will be divided into inland river and offshore departments. The inland river department will be responsible for suppressing the Taihu Lake bandits, and the offshore department will be responsible for suppressing the Yangtze River pirates. Measures have also been formulated.</p>
<p>Silk factories oppose tax on cocoon traders. The issue of collecting business tax from the cocoon trade was previously discussed by Director Yang of the Business Tax Bureau, along with Qian Sunqing, chairman of the County Chamber of Commerce, and Hua Shaochun, chairman of the Cocoon Trade Association. The cocoon trade argued that they were requesting the ministry and province to exempt them from the tax, but had not yet received a response. Moreover, the silkworm season was terrible this year, with only one or two percent of the usual harvest. In fact, it was impossible to add this burden. The director of the Business Tax Bureau, however, stated that the department's orders were strict and could not be delayed any longer. He demanded that the recognized amount be determined first and then start collecting the tax. After repeated discussions, it was decided to recognize an amount of 3,500 yuan. However, yesterday, Yongtai, Qian Sheng, Zhen Yi Cheng, Zhen Yi Xie, Ding Chang, De Feng, Tai Fu, Zhen Feng, Yi Feng, San Tai, Yu Feng, Cheng Feng, Qian Feng, Rui Chang, Yuan Kang, and 15 other silk factories, argued that fresh cocoons purchased in Jiaxing, Zhejiang, and Wu County, Suzhou, were not subject to business tax. Why should Wuxi be the first to collect it? The trade association should seek benefits for the industry. How could it comply with the Business Tax Bureau's intentions and hastily recognize the amount? They immediately sent a letter to the Cocoon Trade Association, stating their opposition and refusing to recognize the recognized tax amount.</p>
<p>Gu Wangyi of Bancun Township kidnapped. Gu Geng Shang, a small village in Bancun Township, tenth district of this county, has a resident named Gu Wangyi, who is over fifty years old and has a small amount of land, barely enough to make a living. However, he was coveted by bandits. At about 3:00 AM the day before yesterday (12th), five or six bandits suddenly arrived, carrying guns and flashlights, broke open the gate of Gu's house, and went straight into the inner room. They did not rob anything but dragged out Gu Wangyi, who was already asleep. Without even putting on his clothes, he was surrounded by the bandits and taken away. Afterwards, his family reported the incident to the district office, which in turn reported it to the police team stationed in the township, requesting a rescue.</p>
<p>Large number of refugees cause trouble in the countryside. Yesterday (13th), more than a hundred refugees, men and women, suddenly arrived at the Da Ci An near Yangjian Town in the eighth district. Most of their clothes were gorgeous. Several leaders of the refugees claimed to the people in the temple, "We want to borrow some travel expenses from you." The temple holder replied that they had no money. The refugees were furious and rushed in, looting extensively. After an hour, they looted more than 200 yuan in cash and two dan of white rice and carried them out. The next morning, the refugees pawned six fur robes at the Kangji Pawnshop in the town for more than 100 yuan. They were spotted by the members of the 28th detachment of the business corps, who saw that they looked flustered and interrogated them. The refugees hesitated and stammered, and a pawn ticket was found in their bags. They were immediately detained and reported to the detachment leader, who immediately sent more than a dozen corps members, armed with guns, to escort the refugees towards Yanqiao. In Dongqiao Town in the ninth district (Beishang Township), fifty or sixty refugees also arrived. The township chief issued them food rations. However, the refugees went to the Xinbaoji Deyin nunnery and robbed it of dozens of silver dollars. Then, they went to the home of a farmer named Ji Huzi in Liubanqiao Township, claiming to be thirsty and asking for tea. Ji believed them and gave them a cup of hot tea to quench their thirst. After the refugees left, his neighbor said that the refugees had an abacus. Ji heard this and immediately went into the room to check the box. Sure enough, 80 silver dollars were missing. He immediately went outside to look for them, but the refugees had long disappeared and could not be found.</p>
<p>Party department investigates private settlement of opium case. Xue Chunxian, a resident of Li She Town (Qingcheng City) in the fifteenth district, smoked opium, defying the current ban. Local people reported this to the 15th Public Security Branch for investigation. However, the branch chief not only did not send police to arrest him but instead sent Shen Jinfu, an outsider, to collude with local ruffian Xue Chaojing to bribe and settle the case privately. The fifth district's third sub-department learned of this and considered that the branch chief dared to accept bribes and settle the case privately, which was corrupt and derelict of duty. The truth should be investigated. Therefore, yesterday, they submitted a request to the higher-level party department to investigate the matter. At the same time, Public Security Director Xu also detected the news and planned to send someone to the countryside to investigate.</p>

Tang Renjie, chief of the ninth public security branch in Butou, Wu County, previously worked with the business corps branch to uncover a robbery plot by Li Si and other bandits and seized three stolen ships, four pistols, bullets, silver ornaments, and other items. However, Wang Zhengshu and Wang Zhengfu were still at large. It was reported that they had fled to Suzhou. Xu Shaoyun, the deputy captain of the Qingxiang Bureau's detective team, was secretly dispatched to Suzhou and captured Wang Zhengshu at the Fu'an Teahouse. He was escorted to Changzhou on the 12th. Wang Zhengfu escaped without a trace.</p>

<p>Deep-water port villagers resist arrest and cause a disturbance: The Construction Bureau is requisitioning labor to expand the Jiangbian revetment of the Deep-water Port. The villagers strongly oppose it. At 5 pm on the 11th, Director Feng Mufu invited County Police Captain Jin Juechen and others to the county government for secret discussions on arresting the ringleaders. At 8 pm, two large vehicles carrying more than 40 armed police officers drove to search and arrest them. They arrested 15 people including Ni Pangzi and Wang Lin in Ni Jiayuan and Wang Jiayuan. Just as they were being escorted onto the vehicles, the villagers rang gongs, and in an instant, six or seven hundred people gathered, each holding farm tools to resist arrest, hoping to rob the arrested people. They smashed the vehicles. The police opened fire as a warning, wounding four people including Zhou Jishi, Chen Pan, Qian Lin, and Shi Pan. The crowd then dispersed. The 15 people including Ni Pangzi were escorted to the county government. On the morning of the 12th, the villagers carried the wounded men and women to the court to request an autopsy and to the county government to request the release of the 15 people in custody. Because County Magistrate Zhang had gone to Jinsha to inspect district affairs and had not returned, there was no result, and they dispersed.</p>

<p>A rural farmer loses his life due to a misunderstanding: Zhang Shaomei, a farmer from Shuangjin Gate in Huaiyin, 29 years old, was harvesting wheat in the field on the 7th when he saw troops passing by. Zhang mistakenly thought the troops were conscripting laborers, so he put down his farm tools and ran away in a hurry. The soldiers saw Zhang's panicked appearance and suspected that he was a bandit, so they opened fire. The shot hit Zhang in the waist, and he fell to the ground immediately. Zhang's family heard the news and rushed over, hurriedly carrying him to the Benevolence Hospital in the port for treatment, but due to the severity of the injury, he could not be saved, and he died on the morning of the 9th.</p>

It was determined that Shi had three gunshot wounds on the left temple and around the ears of her face and was killed. Because no family members of the deceased were present, Jiang Lianke, who rented the house, was ordered to hand over Shi's husband, Wu Yinhou, to the authorities for investigation.</p>

<p>A police team's gambling arrest leads to a fatal case: In Tangjiagang, near Liubaimu Dang on the border of Jiaxing and Jiashan, various gangs of gamblers opened a large gambling den there. The Jiashan County Government, considering that the area belonged to Shan territory, ordered You Sixian, the captain of the patrol team, to lead the police to arrest them. Captain Xu believed that the area was only separated from Jiaxing territory by a river and feared that the gamblers would flee into Jiaxing territory when arrested. Therefore, on the afternoon of the 12th, he personally went to the Jiaxing County Public Security Bureau to report the reason and asked Director Gao to send police to assist. Captain Luo led four patrol officers and accompanied Captain Xu on the No. 1 patrol boat to arrest them. The gamblers fled one after another. At that time, Hu Xueyin was running from Tangjiagang to Hudiegang, already half a mile away. The police officers chased him hard and shot him with a wooden-shell gun, causing Hu to be shot three times and killed on the spot. The other police officers arrested Shen Lianshou, Cai Xiong, Li Deyi, and three others. Captain Xu handed them over to the Jiaxing police team to be escorted to the Jiaxing County Public Security Bureau for temporary detention. Hu's body was carried back to Qianjiaqiao in Tanghui by his family. On the 13th, they reported the case to the Jiaxing and Jiashan County Courts for an autopsy and filed a complaint requesting compensation.</p>

There are six buildings at No. 17, occupied by eight families including Jiang Binghong, Guan Peiran, Li Hongsheng, Zeng Xinglin, Chen Jifu, Jiang Baoting, Jin Dingjun, and Wang Jinshui. Around 9 pm the night before last, Jiang Pan, the mother of the Jiang family, accidentally set fire to the mosquito net while using a lamp to catch bedbugs, and the fire blazed fiercely, making it inaccessible.

<p>Foreign sheds of foreign steamships in Xiangkou are ordered to relocate: Xiangkou Town, located 120 miles upstream of Anqing in Dongliu County, has foreign sheds set up by the Nichi-Qing and Jardine Matheson companies for steamships to stop, load, and unload passengers. Recently, the provincial government, based on the report from Yang Ying, the magistrate of Dongliu County, claimed that the foreign sheds forcibly occupied civilian property. Additionally, based on the report from Zhou Shantong, the director of the Provincial Ship Management Office, the steamships of the two companies often privately transported military supplies and red pills, unloading them in the town. It was requested that this be banned. Therefore, the county magistrate and the Xiangkou Public Security Bureau were instructed to order the Nichi-Qing and Jardine Matheson companies to relocate the foreign sheds within a limited time and to prepare a plan for alternative transportation, requesting the Ministry of Communications to review and approve. Yesterday, instruction No. 2720 from the Ministry of Communications was received, stating that since the foreign sheds set up by the Nichi-Qing and Jardine Matheson companies have now been ordered to relocate within a limited time, efforts should be made to supplement them to facilitate transportation. In addition to ordering the China Merchants and Sanbei companies to handle this matter as soon as possible, they should be informed.</p>

<p>Box tea is changed to business tax collection: Box tea exported from the county to foreign firms was previously subject to special collection by officials sent by the Finance Department. Since the implementation of tax reduction, the tea tax bureaus in various counties have also been abolished. All box tea is now subject to business tax. The Qimen and Shanghai Tea Industry Associations have successively sent telegrams to the Ministry of Finance requesting exemption, which has been approved for reduction. Now, the County Tea Industry Association has received an order from the province, forwarded from the Ministry of Finance, to collect 5/1000 of the capital amount. After receiving the order, the association convened a meeting of all tea merchants to discuss the matter. They all stated that collecting based on the capital amount was inaccurate and proposed collecting 1.4 jiao per box to avoid disputes arising from disagreements over the amount. Li Kangmin, the commissioner of the business tax district stationed in Qimen, Yixian and Wuyuan, recently sent a Mr. Hu to Wuyuan to start the investigation and asked all tea merchants to stamp and register in advance. Once the investigation is completed, the collection will begin.</p>

<h3 id="e106">Zhejiang's New Budget for the 20th Year <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Income: 21,178,957 yuan Expenditure: 27,246,301 yuan</p>
<p>Deficit: 6,067,344 yuan, which will be offset by a discretionary allocation from old debts and public bonds.</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Government, in view of the fact that the reliable income of the province in the 19th year was only more than 15 million yuan, while the expenditures listed required more than 38 million yuan, and the arrears were accumulating, since the reorganization of the provincial government last December, after Chairman Zhang Nanxian took office, similar duplicate organs were separately merged, various expenses were repeatedly reduced, and various organs were ordered to prepare and submit the income and expenditure budget for the 20th year in accordance with the provincial government's austerity policy, so as to match income and expenditure. Therefore, after the budget meeting of the provincial government committee decided to reduce the budget, the relevant competent organs first prepared and sent detailed budgets to the finance department, which then carefully reviewed them. Then, the finance department invited the accounting personnel of the competent organs to attend a meeting to discuss and re-reduce the budget. However, the relevant educational organs did not submit detailed figures for the reduction, and although the original budgets submitted were slightly changed, the total amount was generally the same, so they were still included in accordance with the original budgets submitted. The new budget for the 20th year, which has been compiled by the finance department overnight, is estimated to have an income of 21,178,957 yuan and an expenditure of 27,246,301 yuan. The difference between income and expenditure is a deficit of 6,067,344 yuan. All the insufficient funds will be offset by a discretionary allocation from the 8 million yuan of public bonds issued to clear old debts. Yesterday, the finance department had submitted the above budget to the Zhejiang Provincial Government Committee for discussion.</p>

It is now known that the Finance Department, considering the difficult lives of educators and the end of the semester, has decided to take advantage of the start of tax collection in various counties and the relatively strong income from land taxes to issue education fee notices for March, April, and May in one lump sum, so that all new and old debts of education fees can be completely cleared. It is also heard that it has been decided to send the aforementioned notices to the education department tomorrow (the 15th) so that they can be transferred to the relevant educational organs for application.</p>

<p>The Boy Scout service staff, group, and other three registrations were originally scheduled to end at the end of last month.

<p>Da Xia University held its 7th anniversary and graduation ceremony yesterday (the 13th). More than 2,000 guests including Xu Peihuang, Zhu Jingnong, Zhu Yingpeng, Hu Shuhua, Li Zhaohuan, Chu Fucheng, Xu Peikun, Zhao Yunwen, faculty, and Da Xia graduates attended the ceremony. Parade (Qichang photo)</p>
<p>The meeting started at 9 am, and the ceremony was held as usual. President Wang Boqun was unable to attend due to attending the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Committee. Vice President Ou Yuanhuai represented the chairman and delivered the opening speech, stating that the school was established only seven weeks ago, and the scale is still rough. Judging from the meaning of the school's name Da Xia University (that is, the university of Greater China), it is still far away. I hope that all teachers and students of the school will remember the name and strive together with the spirit of cooperation and struggle to achieve our goals. As for the responsibilities of the graduating students, they are very important. According to recent statistics, there are only more than 17,000 students in national and registered universities in the country, that is, only one person in 20,000 people in our country enters university. Compared with European and American universities, where one school has as many as 10,000 to 20,000 students, there is a vast difference. However, university students are criticized, saying that one more graduate means that the family has one less useful son, and society has one more unemployed person. In all fairness, our country's politics is not on track, and society is in chaos, making it impossible for university students to have a proper way out. This is really not the fault of the university students themselves. How should you overcome this harsh environment to seek a path to self-reliance in the future? Only your own efforts are considered. Next, Wang Yuxiang reported on the progress of the school in the past seven years. Zhu Jingnong then spoke, stating that students graduating is like a ship launching into the water. From now on, the sea is vast, and the future is full of dangerous waves. One must have a fearless spirit. Chinese university students often suffer from having nothing to do after graduation. In fact, there are many things that can be done, only if you can find your own way. I hope that you will work hard in all aspects of society in the future and not only tend to politics. Next, degrees were awarded, songs were sung, and music was played, and the ceremony ended. In the afternoon at 3 pm, various ball games were held, and at 7 pm, there was a grand variety show. It is estimated that there are 7 graduates from the School of Liberal Arts, 2 from the School of Science, 58 from the School of Education, 5 from the School of Business, 21 from the School of Law, 53 from the Advanced Normal Department, and 88 from the Preparatory Department.</p>

The day before yesterday was the first day of the meeting. Visitors from all walks of life and students' families who went to the school for sightseeing on the second day numbered more than 2,000 each day. After the opening ceremony on the first day, Principal Li Bojun of the school first reported on the 30-year history of the school and the construction process of the new dormitory.

<p>|Daxia Volleyball Defeats Jinan Three Sets to Two|</p>
<p>Yesterday, Daxia University held a China-Japan track and field competition to celebrate its 7th anniversary. Simultaneously, there was a volleyball match between the university and Jinan University. The Patriotic Girls' School volleyball team also came to participate and cheer. Due to the late hour, it was difficult to gather the Daxia women's volleyball team, so it was cancelled. In the China-Japan competition, Daxia scored 79 points, and the Japanese residents scored 47 points, resulting in a Daxia victory. In the volleyball match, Daxia also defeated Jinan three sets to two. People are in high spirits during joyous occasions. It is fitting for everyone at Daxia to be motivated and accomplished during this anniversary.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Six Heroes Shine for a Time <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the China-Japan meeting at the Lida River attracted the attention of the general public. In the twelve events, Daxia dominated with nine first places, while the Japanese residents only had one first place and two shared first places (because the Japanese residents requested it, the order was not determined according to the usual rules). Daxia's excellent performance was truly astonishing. When discussing merit and rewards, the six heroes should be commended first. The six heroes are He Debao, Li Shaoshang, Long Zexian, Chen Baoqiu, Luo Chuanxian, and Wu Jinqi. He Debao's 11.52 seconds in the 100 meters and Luo Chuanxian's 17.51 seconds in the high hurdles were the best performances in each event. Long Zexian's 4 minutes and 56 seconds in the 1500 meters was a new school record. The Japanese residents were almost defeated everywhere. Fortunately, Furukawa single-handedly supported Daxia, excelling in both the high hurdles and high jump.</p>

<p>Defeats Jinan Three Sets to Two</p>
<p>The Daxia volleyball team competed against the Jinan volleyball team at 4:00 PM. At the beginning of the match, Daxia's captain, Chen Baoqiu, was absent due to participating in the China-Japan competition. During the intense battle, Jinan showed great momentum, winning two consecutive sets with scores of 21-12 and 21-10. Daxia was in a critical situation. Captain Chen personally joined the ranks, and the entire team rallied. The situation changed. In the subsequent three sets, Daxia won consecutively with scores of 21-14, 21-17, and 21-17, resulting in a victory of three sets to two. The referee was Lu Xiangqian.</p>

<p>The amateur basketball competition at the City No. 1 Public Sports Venue saw the two powerhouses of the God Group, the "Bomber" team and the "Nanguang" team, compete for the championship yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM. The "Nanguang" team had good coordination, while the "Bomber" team displayed exquisite skills. Each team showed their strengths in stealing the ball and shooting baskets. However, basketball is a team sport, not an individual one. Despite the "Bomber" team's strength, they initially fell behind in the first half with a score of 8-11. In the second half, the "Nanguang" team, filled with pride and impatience, directly attacked with the ball, each player wanting to score points, resulting in a disorganized formation. The enemy seized the opportunity to strike, and the situation drastically changed. Xu Zhuo, the left forward of the "Bomber" team, repeatedly made successful shots, gaining great prestige. The score difference was 15-5. In total, the "Bomber" team won the God Group championship of this tournament with a final score of 23-16. The referee was Gong Zhenyi.</p>

<p>(Tokyo Dispatch) Kinue Hitomi, a world-renowned Japanese track and field athlete, is now 25 years old. In 1927, she attended the Second World Women's Games at the age of only 19. Fighting alone, she broke four world records, instantly stunning the world. She is a talented track and field athlete. Her records in the 60-meter dash (7.4 seconds), 100-meter dash (12 seconds), and long jump (6.07 meters) remain unbroken to this day. Her 100-meter result once reached 11.8 seconds, and her name is known worldwide. However, when she participated in the Third World Women's Games last year, her performance declined. She finished third in the 60-meter dash and javelin throw. In the long jump, she won again with a result of 5.95 meters, but she still finished second in the individual overall score. Since returning to Japan, she has been quite discouraged and has been giving speeches everywhere without rest, leading to a severe case of pleurisy. She was hospitalized in Osaka Medical University Hospital last October. She has been seriously ill several times, and doctors were particularly worried. She barely survived, but she has been bedridden for more than half a year and has not yet recovered. Her vitality has been greatly diminished. She knows that the World Games to be held next year in Los Angeles, USA, are approaching, but her life is in danger. She shed tears of sadness and announced her departure from track and field life, retiring from competition. The entire nation of Japan is deeply saddened by this.</p>

<p>National Jinan University 4th Anniversary of University Establishment &amp; 25th Anniversary of School Founding Special Issue No. 1</p>
<h3 id="e130">Preface <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>— Li Bangdong</p>
<p>Today marks the 25th anniversary of our school's founding and the fourth anniversary of its expansion into a university. It is also the graduation ceremony, and the anniversary of President Zheng's return to the school four years ago. Our school colleagues are filled with celebration and joy, and we are honored to have members of the community join us for this grand occasion. Last night, Director Fan advocated for an advance celebration, like a birthday celebration. Today, the atmosphere within the school is vibrant, and our spirits are indescribably joyful. Regarding the school's past achievements, from middle school to a single-faculty university, and then expanded into a comprehensive university by President Zheng, this publication contains detailed accounts, so I will not elaborate further. I am mindful of Jinan's position and the great mission it bears, as well as its rapid progress in recent years. Today's grand event is indeed unlike any ordinary anniversary, and it is more worthy of celebration and praise than any other academic institution. As I participate in this grand occasion, I believe that our school's anniversary today contains at least three essential meanings:</p>
<p>1.  Promoting Public Awareness of Jinan</p>
<p>I recall in the winter of 1928 when I accompanied President Zheng to the north to welcome the coffin. In the past, President Zheng governed the northern region, and his benevolence was widely praised. Former colleagues all came to pay their respects. Some, hearing that our president was now in charge of Jinan, even asked about the location of the school. I was very surprised and secretly regretted why Jinan's name was not known to everyone. Upon reflection, it was not surprising. In the past, Jinan was solely dedicated to cultivating the children of overseas Chinese, with little contact with people in the country, resulting in a sense of separation. Since President Zheng's return, he first expanded the scope of education, broadened its purpose, not only to nurture the children of overseas Chinese but also to cultivate outstanding domestic youth who would help the overseas Chinese develop their businesses, exchanging cultures, and focusing on the big picture. What has been the impact on domestic society over the past four years? How does the broad Jinan of today compare to the narrow Jinan of the past in terms of achievements and mission? The opening of this grand event is precisely to promote a definite understanding of Jinan among the public.</p>
<p>2.  Enhancing Jinan's Academic Standing Internationally</p>
<p>The academic and cultural progress of a nation must be represented by its leading academic institutions, showcasing it to the world. Examples include Cambridge and Oxford in England, Harvard and Yale in America, Paris in France, and Leuven in Belgium. We all know their significance. Then, which academic institution in our country can represent the civilization of this great Eastern nation and be respected by the world? We dare not presume to make false claims. However, given Jinan's short history, with students coming from overseas and talents cultivated and returned to their respective countries, all interacting and engaging with people from foreign lands, its relationship with the international community and its level of civilization can represent our nation. Today's event includes an achievement exhibition, inspiring a sense of awe. How should we promote Jinan's academic culture to elevate its international standing in the future?</p>
<p>3.  Advancing the Substantive Content of the Only Overseas Chinese University</p>
<p>Jinan has been in existence for 25 years, enduring various crises and setbacks. It was also interrupted due to political turmoil. It has only been four years since its expansion into a university. The school funds are stretched thin, and maintaining regular operations is already difficult. Special equipment has not been improved at all. It is thanks to President Zheng's skillful management that the school's property has been used to maintain operations, which is commendable. He once said, "I would rather endure hardship and build the school on a solid foundation, and then seek support from others to further its development, rather than deceive people with empty words and seek help blindly." Therefore, Jinan is reluctant to solicit donations from elders at home and abroad easily. However, the student tuition is the lowest among national universities. The school has achieved today's results through economic methods. On this double anniversary, as we review the past and look forward to the future, how should we promote this only overseas Chinese university to make its content more substantial? Regarding concerns, there is no shortage of enlightened and enthusiastic individuals at home and abroad. In the future, they might also be happy to support Jinan to share President Zheng's responsibility.</p>
<p>From this perspective, Jinan's achievements today are due to President Zheng's tireless efforts. A great harvest comes from distant causes. Jinan's unique spirit was established from the beginning of the school's founding. Please read the school song handwritten by President Zheng during the founding of the school, which reveals that it has a origin and is not accidental. I respectfully record it at the end of my article, using it as a preface. The song goes:</p>
<p>Colonization in Java, our ancestors pioneered, tracing back to ancient times. Why are the elders sleeping soundly, letting others take the lead?</p>
<p>Having cultivated the land with Europeans, we also suffer from harsh taxes. Alas, my compatriots have fallen into the abyss, when will we see the light?</p>
<p>A true man will never accept pity, but instead, pay taxes diligently. Superiority and inferiority are the laws of nature, so let's study science well.</p>
<p>Swearing to expand our country's maritime power, this great responsibility rests on our shoulders. Awaken the spirit of overseas Chinese, and the situation will change. The beautiful rivers and mountains are waiting.</p>

<p>— Zheng Hongnian</p>
<p>I participated in the founding of Jinan School in the thirty-third year of the Qing Guangxu reign, and I reassumed the post of President of Jinan University in the summer of the sixteenth year of the Republic of China. Counting from the former, it has been twenty-five years to this day; counting from the latter, it has also been four years since the reorganization. Alas! Overseas Chinese education is the pivotal point for the rise and fall of our Chinese nation, and the lifeline for the fate of hundreds of millions of overseas Chinese compatriots. It is certainly no small matter concerning one dynasty, one region, or one person! Regardless of my limited abilities, I followed in the footsteps of the late Premier Sun, continuing his unfinished grand vision, and shouldered this heavy responsibility to this day. Now, on the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary, I do not forget the past and respectfully recount one or two things to inform the people of the country.</p>
<p>Recalling the establishment of Jinan School, it was not initially a predetermined plan. At that time, Mr. Qian Nianqiu, the Minister to the Netherlands, sent a counselor to investigate the educational situation in Java, deeply concerned that overseas Chinese children did not know about their ancestral culture and feared the extinction of their race. He then telegraphed Liangjiang Governor-General Duan Fang, requesting him to find a place for returning overseas Chinese students to study. At the beginning of receiving the telegram, Governor-General Duan did not even know what Java meant. It was only after replying to the telegram that he learned Java was a Dutch colony, and that twenty-one overseas Chinese students would return to the country for study. After receiving approval from the Qing court, Mr. Dong Hongyi escorted them north. As most of the overseas Chinese students were registered under the provinces of Fujian and Guangdong, I and Mr. Wen Bingzhong were assigned to take charge of the matter. Mr. Chen Botao, the Jiangnan Director of Studies, strongly supported this initiative and even established a school for lectures, naming it "Jinan." Speaking of the national situation, Nanyang had long been a battleground for the world's great powers, and overseas Chinese had long suffered the pain of being butchered and slaughtered like fish and meat. The establishment of Jinan School was already late. However, those in positions of authority were ignorant and oblivious to the great trends of the world. Governor-General Duan's establishment of Jinan School was even listed in impeachments by those in power. When Zhang Xun stationed troops in Jiangning, Jinan School was placed under strict surveillance. At that time, the people of our country were so isolated from the overseas Chinese situation.</p>
<p>However, the ardent patriotism of the overseas Chinese students was evident from the very beginning of the school. Jinan School was founded the year after the late Premier Sun organized the Tongmenghui (Revolutionary Alliance). The school song I composed at that time focused on awakening national consciousness, which coincided with the Premier's revolutionary goals. Therefore, revolutionary ideas among the students were greatly developed. Around the time of the Xinhai Revolution, some students went to Baoding Military Academy, and others went to study naval affairs. After the revolution began, some went to Wuhan, and some went to Shanghai, all with the ambition to dedicate themselves to serving the country. I still remember that overseas Chinese student, Li Quanfa, was the youngest. One day, he said to me, "Nanyang is the Nanyang of our Chinese nation. Shouldn't those with ambition seek to expand southward!" Although his words were straightforward, his heroic spirit could penetrate the sun and moon! Modern scholars say that the newly emerging people's spirit is full of vigor, and the overseas Chinese students possessed it!</p>
<p>During the Xinhai Revolution, the overseas Chinese students dispersed, and Jinan School was suspended. It was not until the sixth year of the Republic of China that, with the efforts of Mr. Huang Yanpei, preparations were made to reopen the school. In the seventh year of the Republic of China, Jinan School reopened. Since then, Jinan School has been advancing with twists and turns. Mr. Zhao Zhengping served as president from the seventh year of the Republic of China until his resignation in the fourteenth year of the Republic of China, serving a total of seven years. (During the tenth year of the Republic of China, Mr. Ke Zhenxin served as president for one year.) The expansion of the normal school and business school, the completion of the junior high school department, the addition of the business school university department, the purchase of land for the school, and the construction of school buildings were all planned and managed by Mr. Zhengping. In the autumn of the fourteenth year of the Republic of China, Mr. Jiang Bohan succeeded as president, and the organization of the business school university department was largely finalized. Moreover, during times of successive turmoil, Jinan School was able to be maintained without declining due to the efforts of Mr. Bohan and the various school board members. In the summer of the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, I was ordered to take over Jinan School and subsequently received the appointment as president. As an old man, I reassumed the presidency of Jinan University. Speaking personally, overseas Chinese education has been an unfinished wish for the past twenty years, and fulfilling this duty is to fulfill that wish. Speaking publicly, the Premier took rescuing overseas Chinese compatriots as one of the goals of the national revolution, and enhancing education and culture for overseas Chinese is to repay the Premier.</p>
<p>When I first received the order, I immediately expanded the organization and reorganized it into a complete university. In addition to the business school, departments of Chinese Language and Literature, Foreign Languages and Literature, Educational Psychology, Mathematics and Physics, Law, Biology, and History and Sociology were established one after another, and the scale was roughly determined. It is difficult and arduous to start anything, and this is especially true for education. At that time, the lack of talent and the simplicity of materials were all obstacles to expanding the organization. I then visited and sought out famous Confucian scholars and great academics to preside over the lectures; respected the etiquette of teachers and advocated a style of good learning. All that was necessary to gather talents and create a university, I exhausted my heart and diligently sought it. As for the construction of material facilities, the library was completed in the autumn of the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, and the Lientao Hall was built in the winter. The following year, the Science Hall was built first, followed by the junior high school dormitory and classrooms. By the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, the Zhiyuan Hall and the high school dormitory, as well as the middle school department office, were built one after another, and the project was not far from my predetermined plan. Raising tens of thousands of huge sums and managing dozens of construction projects, my heart and energy have also been exhausted!</p>
<p>Currently, the organization of the university includes five colleges: the College of Liberal Arts, the College of Science, the College of Law, the College of Education, and the College of Business. The middle school department includes five departments: the General Studies Department, the Normal School Department, the Business Department, the Agricultural Department, and the Junior High School. In addition, there are four departments: the Secretariat, the Student Affairs Office, the Hongnian Library, and the Nanyang and American Cultural Affairs Department, each responsible for their duties, complementing the academic affairs. In recent years, the ideological circles have been empty, superficial, and shallow, and young students have been superficial and fleeting, which is truly worrying. I am striving to correct this shortcoming. The university's specialized departments are divided into specialized fields to cultivate a style of specialized academic research. Various schools of thought, those that do not conflict with each other, are open to students for free research, but only with the aim of in-depth study and not pursuing empty fame. In recent years, social customs have been thin, and the trend of personal self-interest has increased. All the dirty deeds of petty gains and dog fights are openly adorned with beautiful words, and they live in them without shame. The old ethics have been destroyed, and the new ethics have no discipline. The degradation of human nature to that of animals is chilling. I am striving to punish this shortcoming, taking ethics as the first priority of human discipline; in school, we respect the way of teachers; at home, we cultivate family friendship; in society, we uphold justice; and in the country, we maintain public loyalty. We hope that today's good young people will be tomorrow's good citizens. In recent years, factionalism and partisanship have been everywhere, and the education community, which prides itself on being noble, is also in the same dirty state. In the past few years, I have been fighting against the so-called factions alone. They respond to me with selfishness, and I respond with public interest. Those who wanted to take Jinan University to plant their power eventually returned in vain. In the past, there were often trends formed by waves, but now teachers and students are at peace with each other, with no differences, and purely tending towards academic competition. Secondary education is based on strict training. The curriculum emphasizes basic practice and also emphasizes vocational guidance. Moral training is taken for ideological education to cultivate a complete personality. Middle school is the foundation of the university, and middle school students are the backbone of society, which is the so-called basic education. If middle school students are dissolute and unruly and their tools are not well-trained, it is difficult to glimpse the hall of learning. If their behavior is not restrained, it is difficult to endure the hardships of adversity. The so-called jade must be carved before it can become a useful object. Moreover, overseas Chinese students are naturally candid and their emotions are easily impulsive. Letting them go will lead to rudeness, and pruning and managing them can make them talented. This is why I advocate strict training. As for the patriotism of overseas Chinese students, which flows into extremism, I mainly guide them. Overseas Chinese students return to the country from thousands of miles away, escaping from the iron fist of imperialism under heavy pressure. Their breathing is initially relieved, and their feelings are often deep. They suffer from unequal treatment between ethnic groups and cherish their homeland, and their desire for governance is even more urgent. Moreover, our school's students are all children of middle-class families and below, and they are familiar with the suffering of the people. They take the rise and fall of their families and countries as their own responsibility. Those who preside over education should not hinder this vigor. The way to guide them is to make young people turn to pragmatism, either studying literature, science, or sports, each mastering a skill and each studying a subject. By approaching it with vigor, they can make progress endlessly. Our school's sports, regardless of university or middle school, develop evenly. Without promotion, the technology is improving day by day, which is proof of this. Students' extracurricular study is assisted by the library and research room. The library has more than 100,000 volumes of Chinese and Western books, and the annual book fee is 6,000 yuan as usual. Research rooms are set up in colleges and departments, with professors as mentors. Students each study their own subjects and conduct special research. The research results are compiled and published in quarterly journals for the academic community. The Nanyang and American Cultural Affairs Department is responsible for the research on Nanyang culture, publishing Nanyang Research and Nanyang Series to promote the attention of the Chinese people, and issuing Nanyang Newsletter to disseminate domestic news. Important issues in Nanyang are specially treated by the staff of the department, and they are written into papers for the reference of overseas Chinese compatriots. As for the guidance of returning overseas Chinese students and the supervision of overseas Chinese students in the school, the Student Affairs Office is responsible for it; the Secretariat is responsible for the receipt and expenditure of government affairs and the management of general affairs. Our school's finances are completely open, and even the smallest amount of money can be audited. This is the policy that I have followed since I became the president of the school, and it is what the staff of each session has adhered to.</p>
<p>As I said earlier, overseas Chinese education is no small matter concerning one dynasty, one region, or one person. I have exhausted my foolishness, but I sigh that I cannot reach the depths! Education is to adapt to the needs of society; what overseas Chinese compatriots expect from our Jinan University is to cultivate talents specialized in industry and commerce, and teachers for overseas Chinese education. How many have been trained in the past twenty-five years? What overseas Chinese compatriots expect from our Jinan University is a practical reform plan for industry and commerce, and an improvement plan for economic policies. How much has been planned for overseas Chinese compatriots in the past twenty-five years? Not only that, but overseas Chinese schools rely on the breath of foreigners and let them live and die on their own. Our Jinan University has not planned a policy of protection. Hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese children who are out of school are allowed to win or lose and return to natural evolution. Our Jinan University has not planned a rescue plan. Those who are engaged in overseas Chinese education, our Jinan University has not tried its best to nurture them, and they are uneven. Moreover, due to the different times of development in various parts of Nanyang, the age of receiving education is very different. Our Jinan University has not been able to consider this fact and make up for it separately. Overseas Chinese students are all under strict management overseas, and their parents and brothers are also strictly supervising them. When they return to the country from thousands of miles away, they are far away from their parents and brothers. Our Jinan University has not been able to fulfill the responsibility of parents and teachers, and they sometimes fall into indulgence. Most of the overseas Chinese students are children of poor families, and those who are talented are in poverty. Our Jinan University has not been able to raise enough funds to support these talents. In the end, Jinan University claims to be an overseas Chinese education, but it is no different from other schools. This is what I worry about day and night! Alas! If the national spirit is not revitalized for one day, the national fortune of China will not have the hope of prosperity for one day. If the Chinese nation is not revived for one day, the weak and small nations will not have the chance of recovery for one day. If the Nanyang problem is not resolved for one day, world peace will not have the possibility of realization for one day! I dedicate my aging body to Jinan University, which is to dedicate myself to overseas Chinese education; to repay the Premier, which is to repay the country. Compatriots, overseas Chinese compatriots! Teachers and students of our Jinan University, many hands make light work. Strive for this one breath for the Chinese nation, and perhaps we can compete with the great powers!</p>

<h3 id="e136">Review and Outlook of Jinan University <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>— Fan Shouzhi</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>Jinan University was born in the thirty-third year of Qing Guangxu (1907), and this year marks its twenty-fifth anniversary. Jinan University is a school that bears the special mission of "Overseas Chinese Education." Its life is closely related to the lives of millions of overseas Chinese, and its history is a reflection of the life history of overseas Chinese. In this important sense, we should look back at the evolution of the past twenty-five years.</p>
<p>In the late Qing Dynasty, the atmosphere of "National Awakening" was very strong. Premier Sun's revolutionary cause was most diligently awakening the national consciousness at that time. At the same time, the capitalist sphere of influence expanded to the Pacific, and the Nanyang Islands became a battleground for imperialists. Overseas Chinese compatriots lived under the eaves of others and felt the oppression of imperialists at the outset. Therefore, overseas Chinese compatriots recognized Premier Sun's revolutionary cause the earliest and supported it the most. Jinan School was born in this pervasive atmosphere of national awakening.</p>
<p>The first person to pay attention to overseas Chinese education was Mr. Qian Nianqiu, the Minister to the Netherlands. He understood the crisis of the Chinese nation in the international arena and telegraphed Liangjiang Governor-General Duan Fang, asking him to plan a place for overseas Chinese students to study in the country. Governor-General Duan obtained the permission of the Qing court and invited the current President Zheng Hongnian and Mr. Wen Bingzhong to preside over this matter. The first group of overseas Chinese students who returned to the country were all from Java, totaling twenty-three. Later, places such as Bama Long, Jian Yili, Baca, and Surabaya successively sent some overseas Chinese students back to the country. In the winter of the second year of its founding, there were already 115 overseas Chinese students. In two years, the number of overseas Chinese students increased so quickly, which shows that overseas Chinese compatriots' longing for the motherland was very enthusiastic. Among the overseas Chinese students, they all eagerly expected the revival of China. They not only sympathized with the national revolution but also plucked up the courage to participate. At that time, Jinan School in Nanjing became the center of the revolution. President Zheng did his best to protect the revolutionary cause. The school song he made had the sentence "Pledge to expand the sea power of the motherland, the great task is on our shoulders; awaken the overseas Chinese soul and change the situation, beautiful mountains and rivers," which boiled the blood of many young people!</p>
<p>However, this patriotic enthusiasm interrupted the life of Jinan. The Qing court said a lot of gossip about Governor-General Duan's establishment of Jinan School to accommodate revolutionary youths. The General of Jiangning even used Manchu teachers to monitor Jinan School. Zhang Xun stationed troops in Nanjing and regarded overseas Chinese students without braids as extremely rebellious. In the third year of Xuantong, the revolutionary army launched an uprising in Wuchang, and the provinces in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River responded one after another. Overseas Chinese students in Jinan could not bear this stifling atmosphere and went to Wuchang and Shanghai to participate in revolutionary work, so Jinan School was dissolved invisibly.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Secretary-General Mr. Fan Shouzhi <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>The reopening of Jinan School was in the seventh year of the Republic of China. President Zheng deeply regretted the suspension of Jinan School and tried several times to find a way to reopen it, but he never succeeded. Because Yuan Shikai was afraid that overseas Chinese students would engage in revolution and that overseas Chinese students would help Premier Sun, the reopening of Jinan was hopeless during his lifetime. After the failure of Hongxian's imperial regime and the death of Yuan Shikai, Mr. Huang Yanpei traveled around and began preparations in the winter of the sixth year of the Republic of China, and it was officially established in the spring of the seventh year of the Republic of China, with Zhao Zhengping as the president. At that time, the European War was raging, and white people were busy fighting each other, so they had no time to look east. The industry and commerce of the Nanyang Islands rose in this opportunity. The revived Jinan School met the needs of this environment: first, to cultivate some commercial talents for overseas Chinese compatriots, and second, to cultivate some teachers for overseas Chinese schools for overseas Chinese compatriots. Mr. Zhao Zhengping served as president for seven years and paid the most attention to the Normal School Department and the Business Department, and the equipment was the most complete. Later, he also added the Business School University Department.</p>
<p>The relocation of the school site from Nanjing to Zhenru was also Mr. Zhao Zhengping's plan. He believed that revitalizing commerce was the only way for overseas Chinese compatriots to save themselves, so he worked hard to cultivate commercial experts. The relocation of the school site to near Shanghai was intended to make students close to modern cities and give students the opportunity to practice. Unfortunately, the school building was just completed in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, and the war in Jiangsu and Zhejiang broke out. The original students of the Business School University Department had to borrow studies from China Public School, not to mention any expansion.</p>
<p>After the fourteenth year of the Republic of China, Mr. Jiang Bohan successively served as president for two years. In the changing situation, he barely completed the organization of the Business School University Department and enriched the high school liberal arts department, normal school department, business department, and junior high school department. After the European War, overseas Chinese compatriots were able to maintain their commercial status temporarily, and many overseas Chinese students returned to the country in those years. In the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, the number of students increased to more than 700. Then came the great tide of the National Revolution. In the spring of the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, the National Revolutionary Army occupied Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and Jinan School was expanded into a complete university by President Zheng.</p>
<p>(III)</p>
<p>President Zheng's ambition to reassume the presidency was very grand. He wanted to stabilize the foundation of Jinan University, devote himself to overseas Chinese education to repay Premier Sun, and build a pure academic research institution to comfort the expectations of overseas Chinese elders. Overseas Chinese compatriots are scattered everywhere, with a total of more than six million. Calculated by a thousandth ratio, there are at least tens of thousands of overseas Chinese students. The original buildings of Jinan School can accommodate up to 500 people, which is materially insufficient. In the past four years, President Zheng has tried his best to plan material construction, and has successively built Lientao Hall, Science Hall, Auditorium, Junior High School Dormitory, High School Dormitory, Girls' Dormitory, Faculty and Staff Dormitory, Faculty and Staff Residences, Middle School Department Office, and Middle School Department Classrooms, totaling more than ten items. According to the current situation, it can accommodate 1,500 people. As for books, instruments, and sports equipment, etc., they are added every year, close to 100,000 yuan. Jinan University is in a pioneering situation. Without this massive material construction, the foundation would be difficult to stabilize, and President Zheng took on this responsibility.</p>
<p>Premier Sun's revolutionary cause benefited greatly from the help of overseas Chinese compatriots, so the Premier always cared about the well-being of overseas Chinese compatriots throughout his life and was determined to rescue overseas Chinese compatriots from the unequal iron fist. However, the revolutionary cause has not yet been completed, and Premier Sun has unfortunately passed away. The wish to repay overseas Chinese compatriots has not been achieved. President Zheng took over Jinan University to inherit Premier Sun's wish. President Zheng said: "I am willing to dedicate myself to running overseas Chinese education well, so that overseas Chinese elders can restore their inherent national spirit, and I can also be worthy of the late Premier and comfort his spirit in heaven." In these four years, although President Zheng has not been able to live in the school often because he has been serving the country, his mind has always been planning everything for Jinan.</p>
<p>President Zheng's policy of running Jinan University is to make Jinan University a pure academic research institution. He said: "Saving the country cannot be done by empty shouts. The only way to save the country is to bury oneself in academic research." Since the establishment of the National Government, political tutelage has begun. A country like China, which is vast and rich in resources, lacks nothing but academic experts. After the May Fourth Movement, students were called from schools to the streets, and the streets were full of patriotic youths. Now everyone should be aware that they should return from the streets to the research room. In the past four years, President Zheng has solemnly raised the words "Saving the country through academic research" in every speech, and pointed out the world economic crisis after 1928 and the trend of economic bankruptcy of overseas Chinese, using it to prove that overseas Chinese students' academic research is the great way for overseas Chinese to save themselves. Now, the five colleges of the Faculty, the College of Education, the College of Science, the College of Law, and the College of Business, and the five departments of the Middle School Department, the General Science Department, the Normal School Department, the Business Department, the Agriculture Department, and the Junior High School, have all been fully established. The professors and teachers of each department are recruited from all over the country by President Zheng with the aim of concentrating talents, and they are working together under the banner of academic research.</p>

<p>The anniversary is approaching, and we look back at the past. These twenty-five years have completed three tasks: A. In the national awakening movement, aroused the overseas Chinese compatriots' understanding of the motherland; B. Cultivated many commercial and educational experts in the economic revival of overseas Chinese; C. Established a century-old foundation for overseas Chinese education and expanded Jinan University into a complete academic research university. We look to the future again, and there are many places that should be worked hard for the important mission of "Overseas Chinese Education".</p>

<p>President Zheng said: "I came to run Jinan University to soothe my conscience. I do not use Jinan as a tool for myself or for my personal rights. Everyone should support Jinan, not me personally." Everyone should support Jinan; this is a fundamental statement. All undertakings are built bit by bit by hundreds or thousands of people. President Zheng has exhausted his efforts in material construction and organizational expansion. How to continue this undertaking and how to expand it further is everyone's responsibility. In terms of material construction, important buildings such as the gymnasium, museum, and dining hall are in President Zheng's planned projects, so I will not mention them for now. It is extremely common for a university's library to store tens of millions of books and for a science museum to have tens of millions of dollars' worth of experimental equipment. We, Jinan University, still feel that we are far from this standard. It is also extremely common for a university's academic research to produce a powerful school of thought, such as the French Academy, the Paris Faculty of Arts, the École Normale Supérieure, and the École des Chartes, each representing a school of thought in history. Although our Jinan University aims at overseas Chinese education, there are still very few achievements in specialized research. The Nanyang Islands are proving grounds for various specialized academic disciplines. In addition to teaching returning overseas Chinese students, our Jinan University should also conduct separate investigations into Nanyang, which can be used for specialized academic studies. We have already made a start on the academic research direction proposed by President Zheng. We must carry the heavy burden and walk step by step from today onwards towards that distant future!</p>
<p>The hardships experienced by overseas Chinese in Nanyang in recent years can be said to be the most difficult in the past century, but in the near future, there is no possibility of escaping these hardships. Since Jinan University is closely related to the lives of overseas Chinese, we should find a way to help our compatriots escape their suffering. Moreover, if a world war breaks out, the overseas Chinese in the Nanyang Islands, which are in the sphere of influence of the United Kingdom, Japan, and the United States, will experience even more difficult hardships. We should also plan for how to prevent and relieve these hardships for our compatriots. This is a major responsibility at present, and we must all shoulder it together!</p>
<p>In short, twenty-five years is a very short period, and we have done very little with all our efforts! President Zheng has twice devoted his efforts to overseas Chinese education, and we should work together to continue his undertaking! Let us not forget "saving the country through scholarship," and let us not forget to support Jinan. Only then can we fulfill the mission of overseas Chinese education!</p>

<h3 id="e142">Xiong Shihui's Speech on the Spreading Disaster in Jiangxi <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Saving the Disaster Victims in Jiangxi</p>
<p>Is Saving China</p>
<p>Is Saving Everyone Themselves</p>
<p>Xiong Shihui, Commander of the Songhu Garrison, held a reception for people from all walks of life at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce last night regarding the Jiangxi disaster relief effort. Xu Shiying, Wang Yiting, Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Shi Liangcai, Wang Boqi, and several hundred others attended. Xiong delivered a speech, stating that the severity of the disaster in Jiangxi is a hundred times greater than the drought in the Northwest and the floods in the Northeast. This is well known. As for the Jiangxi disaster relief effort, I have held receptions for people from all walks of life several times. I hope that the people of the country will not say that I am particularly enthusiastic about my hometown. I am indeed from Jiangxi, but the disaster in Jiangxi is by no means a problem for Jiangxi Province alone. Because the bandit disaster in Jiangxi is spreading, if relief is not provided urgently, it will spread to neighboring provinces and become widespread throughout the country, even more terrible than the influenza epidemic that spread to Shanghai years ago. As you all know, the Jiangxi bandits who kill and set fires target the general population, especially those over thirty years of age, those with more than five hundred yuan in property, or the educated intellectuals. As long as one of these three conditions is met, they will be slaughtered. Today, all of you present probably possess the above three qualifications. From the bandits' point of view, you are all on the list for slaughter. Now, if we do not provide relief to the people of Jiangxi who have suffered from the bandit disaster, the bandits will become even more numerous in the future. When the whole country is filled with bandits, not only will we be unable to help others, but I am afraid that there will be no one to save us. Therefore, saving Jiangxi is saving China, and saving the disaster victims in Jiangxi is saving everyone themselves. All circles in Shanghai have already raised huge sums for the droughts in the Northwest and the floods in the Northeast. I believe that they will be even more enthusiastic in providing assistance to the bandit disaster in Jiangxi, which is a hundred times more harmful. Xu Shiying then spoke, saying that the natural disasters in the Northwest and Northeast can be seen and heard. As long as there is money, the dead can be buried, the cold can be clothed, and the hungry can be fed. The human disaster in Jiangxi has resulted in the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of people, the starvation and freezing to death of hundreds of thousands of people, and the displacement of millions of people with nowhere to return. Not only can it not be seen, but even the exact number cannot be investigated. If relief is not provided urgently, more people will be forced to become bandits in the future. We must first save Jiangxi before we can talk about saving China. Yu Qiaqing then spoke, saying that the Jiangxi bandit problem is a matter of national survival and the life and death of the nation, which is more important than any other problem. If the Jiangxi problem can be resolved, the Guangdong problem need not be worried about. Therefore, we must all do our best to help. Wang Xiaolai then spoke, saying that although we in Shanghai have already written many donation checks, we ultimately hope that we in Shanghai can save others, and do not want others to come to Shanghai to save us. Moreover, Commander Xiong is the most wise commander Shanghai has ever had. Our various groups have already raised more than 180,000 yuan for the drought in Shaanxi. We should be even more enthusiastic in donating to the Jiangxi disaster relief effort advocated by Commander Xiong.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Xiong Shihui Discusses the Bandit Suppression Problem <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Hoping for a General Mobilization of Jiangxi People</p>
<p>Obligation is Absolute, Not a Right</p>
<p>Since the central military plan decided to focus all efforts on suppressing bandits in Jiangxi Province, Commander Xiong was summoned to stay in Beijing for many days. He will soon accompany Commander-in-Chief Chiang to Jiangxi. He returned to Longhua yesterday morning, made some arrangements, and issued a statement as follows: In addition to the extremely detailed military arrangements, Commander-in-Chief Chiang's trip to Jiangxi will also include outlines for other issues such as political party affairs, construction, post-disaster relief, and local security. He plans to recruit talents from all parties to conduct in-depth research and formulate plans for implementation. Those from Jiangxi who have special talents and can contribute to various issues, regardless of their previous history in the province, are all among those to be recruited. People of Jiangxi, whether for the province or for the country, must adopt a general mobilization approach during this period. The wise should exert their abilities, the rich should contribute their wealth, the elders should supervise education, and farmers and workers should resume their work. Everyone must be united, and all actions must be carried out in accordance with military law. Only then, after the military has achieved a degree of success, will the common disaster be immediately cleared. What is particularly important is that our common purpose in going to Jiangxi this time is entirely driven by the obligation to love our hometown. We must sacrifice everything, strive to be the government's backing, and seek to enrich our self-reliance, without any private plans for rights. All colleagues must unanimously recognize this. According to this prediction, when Commander-in-Chief Chiang sets off, the accompanying commissioners will be very numerous.</p>
<p>Xiong Shihui came to Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning specifically to raise funds for the Jiangxi disaster. He held a banquet for people from all walks of life at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce last night. According to what Xiong told this newspaper's reporter, I will go to Beijing with Secretary Li Dezhao tomorrow night (i.e., tonight) to accompany Chairman Chiang to Jiangxi to suppress the communists. The date of Chairman Chiang's departure from Beijing has not yet been decided. As for my position as Chief of Staff of the Campaign Headquarters, it concerns my hometown, so I will humbly offer my meager efforts and participate in the final discussions, but there will be no official inauguration ceremony.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Zhang Ji Passes Through Shanghai to Go to Beijing <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Hoping that the Guangdong Issue Can Still Be Resolved Peacefully</p>
<p>Currently Researching Appropriate Solutions</p>
<p>Going to Beijing Tonight to Report on the Progress</p>
<p>Zhang Ji, a member of the Central Supervisory Committee, was ordered to go to Guangdong to mediate for peace. He arrived in Shanghai on the President Wilson from Hong Kong on the 11th. He arrived at the port at 10:30 AM yesterday morning. Liu Luyin, Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, and Chen Xizeng, Director of the Public Security Bureau, personally welcomed him at the pier. After Zhang landed, he went with Liu to Wu Tiecheng's residence on Haig Road to rest. He will take the night express train to Beijing at 11:45 PM tonight to attend the Fifth Plenary Session, report on the progress of negotiations in Guangdong, and discuss the corresponding policy. The situation of his arrival at the port yesterday and Zhang's remarks are recorded below.</p>
<p>The Ship Docks at the Huangpu River: The President Wilson docked at the Fifteenth Pontoon on the Huangpu River at 10:30 AM yesterday morning, near Yangshupu Lan Road. Liu Luyin, Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, and reporters from various newspapers took the Dala Company's small boat from the New Customs Wharf to welcome him. Chen Xizeng, Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, took another Maochang Company's small boat with more than ten police officers to welcome him. They all boarded the ship to meet with Zhang. Zhang was wearing a white linen long gown and smiled as he shook hands with the welcomers, saying that the heat in Guangdong was unbearable and the northerners found it very uncomfortable. He then took the Maochang small boat with Liu and others to the New Customs Wharf to land at 11:10 AM. He then took a car with Liu to Wu Tiecheng's residence to rest.</p>
<p>Hope for Peace: After meeting with Zhang on the ship, this newspaper's reporter had a long conversation with him on the way back on the Maochang small boat. Zhang said that he had repeatedly contacted Mr. Tang Shaochuan, Sun Zhesheng, Wang Zhaoming, and Gu Xiangqin in Guangdong. Both sides were eager for peace, and what they were eager to resolve was the method of peace. This trip to Beijing to attend the Fifth Plenary Session is to report on the attitude of the Guangdong side and to discuss an appropriate solution. I firmly believe that it will not resort to force.</p>
<p>No Comment: When the reporter asked about the two methods of mediation that were rumored to have been drafted by the Central Committee members in Shanghai, (1) holding a plenary meeting of the Central Supervisory Committee in Shanghai, and (2) establishing a political branch in Guangdong, and asked what the Guangdong side's response was to this, Zhang made no comment. He only said that both sides were comrades of many years, and there was nothing that could not be discussed. After arriving in Beijing, I will meet with the various committees and then discuss it.</p>
<p>The Premier's Hometown: Zhang also said that I once accompanied Mr. Tang Shaochuan to visit Zhongshan County, stayed for six days, admired the Premier's residence in Cuiheng Village, and visited the construction projects in Zhongshan County. The progress of all matters was very admirable. The county magistrate is still concurrently held by Tang. The houses in the Premier's ancestral village all face east, but the Premier's house alone faces west, which is also a unique point.</p>
<p>Secretaries Stay in Guangdong: Zhang's two secretaries, Huang Jianfen and Sheng Cheng, who accompanied him to Guangdong, were once kidnapped by bandits in Guangdong. According to Zhang, they were kidnapped by bandits while playing at Baiyun Temple. The authorities ordered Panyu County to solve the case within three days. The bandits knew that the county government was looking for them, so they sent them out the next day. They are now out of danger and are recuperating in Guangzhou due to minor illnesses. They will return to Shanghai soon.</p>
<p>Not Going North for the Time Being: Zhang also said that everyone in the country, from top to bottom, hopes for peace, and only the Communist Party and certain foreigners do not want our country to be in chaos. For example, the recent rumors that I will stay in Guangdong and not return, and that I will return north from Hong Kong instead of going to Nanjing, are all kinds of discord and instigation, and their joy in chaos is obvious. This time I am going to Beijing to discuss mediation methods with the Central Government and will not go north for the time being.</p>
<p>Telegram to Beijing: After arriving in Shanghai, Zhang immediately telegraphed Beijing through Chen Xizeng to report his whereabouts, and said that he would take the night train to Beijing tonight to personally report everything.</p>
<p>Visit to Zhang Jingjiang: After lunch at Wu's residence yesterday afternoon, Zhang went with Liu Luyin to Masnan Road at 1:30 PM to visit Zhang Jingjiang, report on the progress of the negotiations, and talk in detail for about half an hour before leaving. Zhang Jingjiang is temporarily unable to go to Beijing due to illness.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Guangdong Pilot He Huiwu Passes Through Shanghai <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Guangdong Aviation School Students Accompany Him</p>
<p>Guangdong pilot He Huiwu received a telegram from Huang Yupei, captain of the 6th Team of the Central Aviation Corps, at the beginning of the month, and left Guangzhou on the 5th of this month with three aviation students from the 4th class of the Guangdong Aviation School. They came to Shanghai from Hong Kong on the Taiyo Maru and went to Beijing last night. Before leaving, He Huiwu told reporters that Guangdong has more than 20 airplanes, but most of them are damaged and cannot be used in combat. There were originally three aviation teams, with Hu Jinya as the captain of the 1st Team, Deng Yueming as the captain of the 2nd Team, and Chen Yousheng as the captain of the 3rd Team. However, the 3rd Team only had three training planes when it was first established. After Zhang Huichang arrived in Guangdong, Chen Jitang appointed him as the Air Force Commander, and he is now planning to organize three more air force teams, with Yang Guanyu, Tian Xi, and Ding Ji as the captains. However, there is a lack of airplanes and insufficient financial resources. Although it was previously planned that the Guangdong Headquarters would allocate 500,000 yuan to send Huang Guangrui to France to purchase airplanes, this plan has now been canceled in effect. Moreover, Zhang Huichang and Huang Guangrui have long been at odds with each other and jealous of each other. Before long, there will be changes in the Guangdong aviation industry. As for military and political figures such as Chen Ce, Chen Qingyun, and Xiang Hanping, they have always supported the Central Government. Before Sun Ke and Wang Jingwei entered Guangdong, they had all tried their best to promote peace. Therefore, they will soon jointly send a telegram to return to the right path.</p>
<h3 id="e146">First District Party Headquarters Sends a Telegram to Expel Chen Youren <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>The Nation Will Not Tolerate Descendants of the Dark Registry</p>
<p>The Land Will Not Keep Submissive Subjects of Red Russia</p>
<p>The First District Party Headquarters of this city has telegraphed Chen Youren, urging him to leave Guangdong immediately, and has also issued a circular telegram. The original text is as follows: To all levels of party headquarters at home and abroad, all national agencies, all organizations, and all newspapers, please note. We have just sent a telegram to Chen Youren, which reads: "You were born on the black island of Totda in South America, a rogue and a beggar of English nationality. Since Guangzhou became a government, it has been recruiting fugitives and thieves from all over the world to claim a small court for itself. You have come a long way and have also seized a seat in diplomacy. In recent days, you have repeatedly made crazy remarks, slandering the Central Government. The bizarre nature of the pseudo-government of Guangzhou has become even more obvious to China and foreign countries since your participation. I recall that when the Premier established the government in Guangdong, you were in the ranks of the porters, fortunately receiving his kindness. Later, Borodin, because you did not understand Chinese, was suitable as a puppet, and asked in many ways, and was promoted to Minister of Foreign Affairs. From then on, you rushed to Borodin's door, but only provided service, and finally the post of Minister of Foreign Affairs was nothing more than Borodin's mouthpiece. After Borodin was expelled, you were uneasy in your position, looking forward to advancement and scrambling to take advantage of the situation. For several years, you have submitted to Soviet Russia with a submissive heart. Soviet Russia also feels that since you have been raised, you will surely be able to drive you to serve. Now, the pseudo-government of Guangzhou has unknowingly employed you, giving arms to the enemy and giving food to the thieves. Its self-destruction is not to be discussed. However, for you, it is also a chance to serve the tiger and to repay Soviet Russia for a thousand years. However, your mixed-race precious daughter is still wandering in the dance halls and singing stages of Moscow, offering her charms for people to enjoy every night. Your black-skinned wife is still guarding the black registry in South America, waiting for the return of the handsome man. You have suddenly bewitched young women, pursuing the powerful, and sitting among the comrades in Lingqiao, looking like a human being. You grew up in a foreign land and have not heard the teachings of poetry and books, abandoning benevolence and righteousness. It is not surprising. However, your lungs have been seen through by the people of the country, and the tricks of the donkey in Guizhou are also coming to an end in time. If you are still shameless, bragging and boasting, you are too immeasurable. I dare to tell you, the black-registered demon king, the descendant of Kritofer, the submissive subject in the wings of Red Imperialism, cannot be tolerated by our people, nor is he allowed to stay in our land. If he lingers in Lingbiao, reluctant to leave, know that 'Henan is not far away, and you will be the 'ghost island' where he will stay for a long time.' Sincerely, we hereby announce this for your attention." Sincerely, we hope you will give it your attention. The Executive Committee of the First District of the Shanghai Special Municipality of the Chinese Kuomintang, Wen Yin.</p>

<p>Since Chen Mingshu went to Jiangxi, he issued a circular telegram, commanding the two divisions of the 19th Route Army, Jiang Guangnai and Cai Tingkai, to actively suppress the bandits. According to news obtained by the Xin Sheng News Agency yesterday from the Guangdong side in this city, after Chen returned to Jiangxi, an emergency meeting was held, and it was decided to shorten the defense line. Daju, Nanxiong, and Shixing on the northern route were all abandoned. Tan Xinglang's regiment was ordered to withdraw from Xinfeng to Nanxiong and stationed in Xiongshi. The various armies were also ordered to withdraw to Shao, and it was decided to use the Shao line, the Yingde line, and the Qingjiang line as the defense lines.</p>

<p>Deng Zhenquan, Commander of the Wusong Fortress, telegraphed the Nanchang Camp to inquire about He Yingqin's recent situation.

<p>Yesterday, this newspaper's Nanjing telegram stated that the Turkish Embassy in China would be closed due to the country's budget cuts, and that all affairs of Turkish nationals in China would be entrusted to the Dutch ambassador. The Turkish Chargé d'Affaires, Fudepei, would soon return home. When this was investigated at the Turkish Embassy in this city yesterday, it was said that Ambassador Fu had not yet received instructions from his government regarding this matter, and it was feared that it was a rumor. Moreover, the Sino-Turkish Commercial Treaty had recently been signed, and Turkey was planning to engage in commercial activities with China, so it was unlikely that the embassy would be closed.</p>

<p>More Than 500,000 Yuan Has Been Raised</p>

<h3 id="e154">Unresolved Case of National Products Department Store Closure <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Council Says Equipment is Fully Restorable</p>
<p>Staff Posting Slogans Arrested then Released</p>
<p>The Chinese National Products United Department Store has remained closed for five days since the Shanghai Municipal Council ordered its shutdown. The following is a record of yesterday's events:</p>
<p>Industrial Department Investigation: Guo Bingwen, Director of the Industrial and Commercial Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, was ordered by the ministry to investigate the closure of the Chinese National Products United Department Store by the Municipal Council. Yesterday, he specially dispatched Pan Zengyin to investigate the truth from all sides in order to report back to the ministry.</p>
<p>Municipal Council Letter: Michael, Acting Secretary of the Public Concession Municipal Council, sent a letter to the National Products Department Store yesterday, saying, "To Mr. Zhang Deyin of the National Products Department Store: Regarding your letter of June 4th to the assistant of the Revenue Department of our bureau, discussing the improvements the Municipal Council and the Fire Brigade require before issuing a license to your store, we now reply to you that while some improvements have been made, conversely, our bureau believes that many of your store's imperfect facilities actually reduce the safety of the building. The improvements required by our departments are purely for the sake of protecting the lives and property of the people within the concession. If you can comply with these requirements and they are deemed satisfactory by the relevant departments, the license to resume business can be issued immediately. We hope for your cooperation."</p>
<p>Staff Arrested and Released: Staff members of the National Products Department Store have been arrested by the police three times, and all have been released completely. Yesterday morning at 4:40 AM, two staff members, Lou Shangde, a clerk from Shuntai Silk Store, and Jiang Sibao, a new staff member from Sanlin Toys, were arrested by Chinese detectives from the New Gate Police Station for posting slogans. They were detained for two hours and then released.</p>
<p>Party Headquarters Instructions: Wu Kaixian, Pan Gongzhan, and Wu Bochen, standing committee members of the Municipal Party Headquarters, received a petition yesterday from the National Products Department Store regarding the unwarranted closure of the Chinese National Products United Department Store by the Public Concession Police, requesting serious negotiations. The instructions given were to forward the petition to the Municipal Government for review with additional comments.</p>
<p>Manufacturer's Petition: The National Products Department Store Manufacturers Association sent a letter to Wu Jingxiong and He Deqiu, municipal advisors to the Municipal Council, stating, "To Mr. Deqiu and Mr. Jingxiong: We, the manufacturers, recognizing the weakness of national products and the failure of vigorous promotion, participated in the National Products Department Store in July of last year at the former Municipal Hall site on Nanjing Road, aiming to promote sales and develop the future. However, since participating, the progress has been extremely difficult due to the embryonic stage of national products. Statistics show that annual losses have exceeded one million. We have not allowed such a large sacrifice to hinder our initial purpose. This time, the department store moved to the historically significant New World site in Shanghai for reorganization, hoping to develop the business after initial planning. Unexpectedly, on the 9th of this month, at 3 PM, the police suddenly closed all the doors and ordered the store to close, and successively arrested store staff, arresting and releasing them intermittently. What legal basis is there for this behavior? This kind of action is clearly destroying national products, placing our national economy and people's livelihood in a desperate situation, and treating the dignity of us Chinese people like dirt. The actual truth and the process have been reported in the newspapers for several days, and we believe you are already aware of them. We have always known that you care about the people's livelihood, and we earnestly request you to uphold justice. We are extremely eager for this."</p>
<p>Party Headquarters Declaration: The Fifth District Party Headquarters declared, "British imperialism has written many sad and infuriating facts in the history of its aggression against China. Even today, when our party has unified China, it has not restrained its actions. Arrogant behavior and unreasonable actions continue to emerge endlessly. Looking at the recent closure of the Chinese National Products Department Store by the Municipal Council on the pretext of reasons, the ferocious face of British imperialism is even more exposed. The tools of imperialism for invading weak nations are nothing more than three types: population oppression, political oppression, and economic oppression. Among these three, economic oppression is the most dangerous. For several years, our country has strived to fundamentally overthrow the imperialist system. The most important thing is to resist imperialist economic aggression and strive to liberate ourselves from the iron hooves of imperialist economic aggression. Under this anti-imperialist movement, promoting the national products movement is the most effective and fundamental movement. Anyone who loves the country wants to recover China's annual economic losses. Who does not agree? Unexpectedly, like a bolt from the blue, the British Municipal Council suddenly closed the department store on the pretext of reasons and arrested three staff members. Who is not shocked when the news comes? Who is not indignant? This association believes that the Municipal Council's action is definitely not for a simple notification issue. It must be intentionally destroying our country's national products movement in order to maintain its imperialist interests as its ultimate goal. We believe that this incident itself (closing a national products department store) is small, but the fact that British imperialism uses its concession privileges to oppress the Chinese and insult our national system is significant. On the one hand, we oppose the Municipal Council's closure of the department store and hope that the Municipal Council will reopen it as soon as possible and apologize. On the other hand, we must also put forward two great slogans: (1) Recover the concessions; (2) Abolish unequal treaties. Since the closing of the National Assembly, the government and the people have been striving to achieve the independence and freedom of the entire nation. We hope that the government will promptly implement the abolition of treaties and recover all concessions. This declaration is made."</p>
<p>National Products Association Telegram: The Shanghai National Products Factories United Association telegraphed the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Municipal Government, saying, "On the 9th of this month, the Public Concession Police dispatched police to order the National Products Department Store to close and beat and detain staff. This is not only destroying national products, but also despising national rights. If this can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated? The association held a meeting to discuss the matter and unanimously decided to engage in serious negotiations. It was resolved that, in addition to telegraphing the central government for assistance, we also request your department to warn the Municipal Council to bear full responsibility for this provocation. This telegram is respectfully submitted for your review and implementation."</p>
<p>Academic Circles Expressed: More than 20 schools, including Pudong Middle School, held an emergency conference yesterday afternoon at 2 PM. Sun Yucai was publicly elected as chairman to discuss the case of the forced closure of the National Products Department Store. It was resolved that: (1) propaganda teams will set out to publicize the issue; (2) further assistance measures will be determined based on the results of negotiations with the authorities. Furthermore, the Suzhou Students Association in Shanghai dispatched Qian Daming, Li Shidu, and two other representatives to the National Products Department Store to express their condolences and offer their support.</p>
<p>Telegraph to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: The Biscuit and Candy Trade Association telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, saying, "To Minister Wang of the Nanjing Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Mr. Zhang Zilian and other Shanghai merchants initiated the National Products United Department Store, intending to promote national products and resist foreign goods, which has been deeply supported by all sectors. On June 9th, the Public Concession Municipal Council, on the pretext of non-compliance with layout procedures, suddenly dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to force the store to close, seal the doors, and arrest staff, with various destructive measures. If we do not protest strongly, national rights and people's livelihood will be completely lost. Therefore, we telegraphically request that Your Excellency promptly send a senior official to Shanghai to negotiate. We swear not to give up until we achieve victory. The telegram is urgent and we await your orders with utmost anxiety."</p>

<p>China Merchants Bureau Ships Returned Five</p>
<p>Guo Waifeng, Director-General of the China Merchants Bureau, went to Beijing a few days ago to discuss important matters and returned to Shanghai yesterday. It is understood that Guo's trip to Beijing was due to the conscription of more than ten ships from the bureau after the central government's anti-bandit campaign intensified. Therefore, Guo specially negotiated with the Transportation Department of the General Headquarters, which agreed to return five ships within days.</p>
<h3 id="e156">News of British Warship Collision Case Yesterday <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Yingkou Reply Still Does Not Mention Yu Da</p>
<p>Whether the Yu Da steamer of the Shanghai Haichang Steamship Company collided with the British submarine Perseus, resulting in the drowning of eighteen British soldiers, is still difficult to determine. The Haichang Company has repeatedly telegraphed Yingkou to inquire. The reply received from Yingkou at 8 PM the night before yesterday, sent at 8 AM that morning, stated that the Yu Ji departed for Shanghai. At the same time, the Hai Shun steamer from Niuzhuang also telegraphed yesterday, but neither mentioned the Yu Da. Therefore, suspicions remain unresolved. It is expected that the matter can be clarified after the Hai Shun and Yu Ji arrive in Shanghai tomorrow.</p>
<h3 id="e157">The Mutual Collision Case of Da Hua and Da Chang Steamers Has Not Yet Been Publicly Adjudicated <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Because the Arbitration Conditions Have Not Yet Been Agreed Upon</p>
<p>Ping An Company Requests a Sincere Meeting</p>
<p>The Guomin News Agency says that the Da Chang steamer collided with the Da Hua steamer, causing the Da Chang steamer's engine room to leak and sink, while the bow of the Da Hua was damaged. According to the Ping An Company, the owner of the Da Hua, the Da Chang took the wrong route at the time and drove into the Da Hua's waterway. When it realized this, it hurriedly crossed the bow of the Da Hua, trying to enter the correct route, but it was too late, and the left side of the hull crashed into the bow of the Da Hua. Therefore, the accident was entirely due to the Da Chang's violation of navigation rules. The Da Hua not only had no fault beforehand but also did its best to rescue afterward. However, the Da Hua Company, the owner of the Da Chang, held a dissenting opinion on the aforementioned statement, insisting that the Ping An Company should be responsible. As for exactly why Ping An should be responsible, that is, how the Da Hua's driving was wrong, it has never provided specific details, only vaguely claiming that the Da Hua should be responsible. Since the statements of both parties differed, both agreed to submit to expert arbitration to clarify the truth. However, the arbitration requires prior agreement on the arbitration rules, specifying the number of arbitrators and the arbitration procedure, and guaranteeing that both parties have the ability to fulfill the judgment after the arbitration. In the initial consultations, the original plan was for both parties to send responsible representatives to a meeting at the Navigation Association. Ping An's attitude seemed quite sincere, but it was reported that the Da Hua Company was being manipulated by a certain insurance company regarding this case, refusing to send the Da Hua Company's manager to the meeting for sincere discussion of the contract conditions, and even wanting to invite a lawyer to attend the Navigation Association meeting to participate in the meeting. Ping An believed that this would not lead to any results, and it would be easier for the managers of the two companies to have a face-to-face and sincere discussion. The following is the letter from the Ping An Company to the Da Hua Company: "In response to your company's letter of the 8th of this month, we have learned that our company's previous letter specifically explained the identity of the representatives, for fear that one party might not be clear, so we clarified in advance to avoid misunderstandings from occurring temporarily. Moreover, the company's important staff member is Manager Ou, so we requested that the manager attend in person, precisely to express solemnity, not to impose restrictions. Now, after reading your letter, your explanation of the representatives differs from our company's opinion, and you have even changed the original agreement, in addition to wanting to appoint someone other than the company's legal representative as the representative, and also intending to add a consulting lawyer. Our company finds it difficult to agree to this new proposal. We sincerely hope that you will still follow the original agreement and the statement in our company's previous letter and sincerely discuss the conditions. If there are any further changes, our company will not be responsible for the delay." This letter is addressed to the Da Hua Company, Ping An Company, June 13, 20th year.</p>

<p>Departing from Shanghai to Hangzhou on July 1st</p>
<p>Tian Shulan, a geography professor at Minzhi Middle School, is scheduled to depart from Shanghai on a bicycle on July 1st, with the aim of touring the country in six years. According to Tian, who spoke to a reporter from the Guowen News Agency yesterday, for six or seven years, he has been working in Nanjing, teaching courses in various schools, all focusing on geography. He has always been skeptical of geography books and has observed with a comparative eye, feeling that there is a need for pragmatic research. Foreigners often come to China to investigate because of China's vast land, abundant resources, and special natural endowments. Some foreigners understand our national conditions even more precisely than our own people. This time, I (Tian said) have the ambition to tour, hoping to observe what others cannot observe, and to search for what others cannot easily search for, such as geographical formations, folk customs, scenic spots, and other data. I will complete this in six years and compile a book to contribute to the people of our country. Recently, I have been making temporary changes to the planned six-year route, depending on the conditions of each province I pass through. Tian's business card is printed with phrases such as "Traverse Divine China, Tour the Earth, The World is One Family, China is One Person." Looking at the drawing instruments, handwritten maps, military water bottles, and specially made bags placed on the wall of Tian's residence, the scene in the room is particularly unique.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Shocking News of Missing Coffin <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Wang Ahua Murder Case</p>
<p>The Court Scheduled Inspection for the 15th</p>
<p>Yesterday Morning the Coffin Was Discovered Missing</p>
<p>Later Found in Reeds Far Away</p>
<p>Wang Fengzhou's son, Ahua, a villager from Luqitang Township in Yuepu Township, northwest of Wusong, went to Song on the 19th of last month. Through an introduction, he worked as a helper at Gao Yisheng's home in Nan Xujiawan, Zhang Huabang. Later, Ahua suddenly disappeared. Subsequently, a floating corpse was found in the Hejiaqiao River. Because it was unclaimed, the local security officer Qin Baolin put it in a coffin and placed it in a nearby public cemetery. Later, it was identified as Wang Ahua's body. Furthermore, there were many discussions outside, claiming that Ahua was beaten to death for stealing a sheep from his master Gao Yisheng's home, and the body was thrown into the river. Wang Fengzhou received this bad news and reported it to the First Branch of the Seventh District of the Public Security Bureau on the 4th of this month. The branch dispatched police to arrest the suspect Gao Yisheng and summoned the security officer Qin Baolin, Yan Chunshan, and witness Tang Arong to the case and sent it to the Local Court for investigation. Details have been recorded in this newspaper twice. The Local Court held a hearing on the case once and scheduled an inspection of the coffin on the 15th. The day before yesterday, Wang Fengzhou, the father of the deceased, received a subpoena from the court. Yesterday morning before 9 AM, he went to the public cemetery near Heqiao to inspect his son's coffin. When he arrived at the public cemetery, he was surprised to find that the heavy coffin had disappeared. He searched everywhere without a trace. Wang Fengzhou was greatly shocked. Considering the importance of the matter, he immediately took a car to Shanghai to report it to the Local Court and request an investigation. Meanwhile, he sent people everywhere to investigate the whereabouts of the coffin. It was not until around 1 PM that the coffin was found by someone in the reeds northwest of the Xujiazhai, about half a mile east of Heqiao. The most peculiar thing was that a corner of the coffin's head on the left side had been sawn off. The secret mark originally made by the corpse's family on the coffin had also been moved by a grain of rice. As for the internal condition of the coffin, it is difficult to understand for the time being. Since this strange incident occurred, people from far and near have been flocking to watch, and all are greatly astonished.</p>

<p>Not Forgetting His Fur Coat</p>
<p>Requesting it be Placed on His Body</p>
<p>Pan Xitang (also known as Cao Dengshan) and Zhao Faqing, Ma Xibing, formerly platoon leaders under Bai Baoshan, became bandits in Shanghai after being disbanded. On the night of November 14th of the 16th year, the Cantonese Liang Shaoxuan, who lived at No. 48 Deqing Lane, Peng Road, was kidnapped by bandits. Pan was the mastermind. He was arrested by the police last winter and sent to the Special District Local Court, which sentenced him to death.</p>
<p>After submitting to the higher authorities for approval, the execution was carried out according to the law. Yesterday morning, Judge Cheng of the Special Court ordered the bandit to be brought forward and asked if he had any last words. Pan requested to send a letter to Father Lao Yuren at No. 5 Jin Gengyu Lane, to be forwarded to his brother Cao Dengyu to take care of his children, and said that he still had a fur coat that could be placed on his body after the execution. Finally, he begged for wine and food. Judge Cheng then ordered him to be taken down. After the prisoner finished his meal, he was escorted onto a prison van and taken to the Caohejing Jiangsu Second Prison execution ground to be shot.</p>

<p>Ye Pays 3,000 Yuan in One Lump Sum</p>
<p>The Man and Woman Will Have No Further Relationship From Now On</p>
<p>Ye Zhongfang and Chen Xiuzhen have been in litigation for several months, which has not been resolved. This newspaper has reported on it many times. Since Chen returned to her mother's house, Ye has still been unable to forget Chen, even wanting to mend the broken mirror. Later, Ye's relatives and friends and lawyer Dong Yu repeatedly persuaded Zhongfang, and he finally agreed to painfully sever the emotional ties and decided to end the husband-concubine relationship with Xiuzhen. On the one hand, the lawyer applied to the court for an extension of the trial period, and on the other hand, he proceeded with reconciliation. It has been three weeks, but the conditions have delayed the reconciliation. It is now reported that Dong Yu, the lawyer, invited Ye Zhongfang and Chen Xiuzhen's lawyer Yao Zhaodi, etc., to continue discussing the reconciliation terms at Dong's law firm the night before yesterday. At that time, both parties were able to understand each other and were willing to settle peacefully. The reconciliation contract they signed was roughly as follows: (1) From the date of signing this contract, Chen Xiuzhen and Ye Zhongfang will terminate all relations arising from cohabitation. In the future, both parties will be free to marry and live their own lives. (2) After Chen Xiuzhen leaves Ye Zhongfang, she is free to choose her profession, and Ye Zhongfang will not interfere. If Chen Xiuzhen becomes a dancer again, she must not ask him to accompany her, so as not to cause misunderstandings. (3) Ye Zhongfang and Ye Pengshi should jointly and severally pay Chen Xiuzhen and Chen Yanshi 3,000 yuan in cash within three days, and return Chen Xiuzhen's clothes and ornaments left in Ye's home, including a diamond-studded watch and two diamond rings, to Chen Xiuzhen. The recipient will issue a separate receipt as proof. (4) Once Ye Zhongfang and Ye Pengshi fulfill the above conditions and deliver the money, clothes, and ornaments, all parties will withdraw the cases they have already filed and will not cause any further disputes. After both parties agreed, they wrote five identical copies of the reconciliation contract for Ye Zhongfang, Chen Xiuzhen, Ye Pengshi, Chen Yanshi, Ye Lushi, and the certifying lawyers Jiang Yiping, Dong Yu, and Yao Zhaodi, and all the above-mentioned names signed and sealed the documents. The two lawyers, Dong Yu and Yao Zhaodi, yesterday filed separate petitions with the Special District Court and the French Court, requesting the withdrawal of the cases.</p>

<p>Sad Events Bring Tears</p>
<p>Jumped into Huangpu River, Fortunately Rescued</p>
<p>At 0:40 AM yesterday morning, at the Public Concession Hospital pier in Suzhou Creek, a young woman wearing a cheongsam and with short hair, suddenly jumped into the river to commit suicide when no one was on the shore. Fortunately, she was spotted by Hua, a patrolman from the Seventh Station of the Maritime Customs Police Station, who immediately stepped forward and rescued her, allowing her to be reborn. She was taken to the police station by the patrolman. According to her confession, her surname is Chen, her name is Xuanying, also known as Huizhen, she is 17 years old, from Suzhou, and lives on the third floor of the Kotada Yoko shoe store at No. 200 Seymour Road, Jing'an Temple Road. Her father's name is Youyue, and she has a stepmother, two older sisters, one older brother, one sister-in-law, and one younger brother. Four months before today, the owner of the shoe store, Guan, talked to me from time to time and accompanied me to the cinema. According to him, he was not married and revealed his admiration for me, further proposing to me. However, I did not express my consent at the time,</p>
<p>Whether or not to agree. Since then, Guan has become even more intimate with me. I was confused for a while, thinking that free love was not a shameful thing, so a month ago, we went to the Shenzhou Hotel on Fourth Horse Road together for one night. Afterwards, we went to the Gaosheng Hotel on Fifth Horse Road for two nights. A moment of error, lost my virginity forever. Eventually, the matter was discovered by my family because it was not kept secret. My father became even more furious and recently drove me out of the house, saying that I was shameless and should not come home again, shaming the Chen family, etc. Unable to do otherwise, I planned to find a place to live temporarily, so I made an appointment with Guan to discuss finding a house to live together. Unexpectedly, Guan was iron-hearted and cold, abandoned me, making me a helpless orphan who had not yet entered the world. I had nowhere to turn. I wanted to go home and beg my parents to forgive my momentary foolishness and take me in, but I did not have the courage to do so. In the end, I decided to die to get rid of my troubles, etc. According to the police chief, seeing that she was very pitiful, he ordered Detective Wu Rongsheng to escort her to the Local Court at 2 PM yesterday to seek relief.</p>

<p>The notorious thief Zhi Jingui, also known as Zhi Xiaotao, committed numerous robberies in Yancheng and other places in northern Jiangsu, totaling more than 70 cases.

Later, Zhang Zhijiang, the Jiangsu Pacification Commissioner, sent officials to Shanghai with documents to welcome and extract him from the French Court, which approved the transfer. However, Zhi was dissatisfied with the first instance verdict of the French Court and requested a retrial. The Chinese and Western officials approved the petition and summoned him for questioning, and then announced the verdict. The Pacification Commissioner's Office sent officials to negotiate the extradition. As reported previously, yesterday was the date of the verdict. The police escorted Zhi to the French Court, where the Chinese and Western officials ruled that the case would still be executed according to the first instance Tang Yu, and ordered the defendant Zhi Jingui to be handed over to the mainland government officials to be taken away for investigation and verification.</p>

<p>On March 7th of this year, Qi Haitian, the leader of the Detective Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, intercepted seven notorious thieves near Xiaobeimen who were attempting to commit robbery and resisting arrest by opening electric guns. The details were reported in this newspaper that day. However, one of the seven thieves, Wang Yaoting from Wuxi, suddenly confessed during the interrogation that he was involved in the assassination of An Zhendong, a patrolman in the Fourth District of Zhabei, and said that the case was instigated by Li Maolin, the owner of the Liangxi Hotel at No. 45 Hubei Road. The Public Security Bureau, considering the case to be serious because it involved the assassination of a public official, the original investigators and the police station arrested Li. After several interrogations, it was ordered that Li be temporarily released on bail and await summons. Recently, it was heard that after the seven thieves were sent to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, Wang still insisted on his previous confession during the repeated preliminary hearings, insisting that Li Maolin was indeed the instigator of An's murder. For the sake of prudence, the military court specially ordered the original investigator of the Detective Team, Qi Haitian, to come to the case for questioning during the retrial yesterday afternoon. Leader Qi reported all the details, one by one, recounting how he solved the case at the time, how he led the team for strict interrogation, how Wang suddenly confessed to the An case, how he joined forces with the police to arrest Li Maolin, how Wang was taken to the scene of the incident to identify it without error, and how the Special District Court opposed bringing Li to be questioned, etc. After hearing the confession, the military judge believed that it was necessary to bring Li Maolin to the case for questioning and ordered Wang to be remanded in custody, pending a written request to the Special District Court to arrest Li and conduct further verification.</p>

<p>Driver Flees After Causing Accident</p>
<p>Huang bao cart driver Zhi Haipeng, a native of Yancheng, was hired by passenger Chen Chang'an on the afternoon of the day before yesterday, at 1 p.m., on Xiaoshadu Road to take him elsewhere. After traveling only a few steps, a No. 6901 cargo truck came head-on and knocked over the huang bao cart. Chen suffered minor injuries, while Zhi was crushed under the wheels of the truck. The truck driver, Shao Xinchun, seeing that he had caused an accident, immediately drove away. When the police were informed, they sent detectives to the scene to investigate. They found that Zhi had died and taken the body to the forensic examination office on Faelun Road. Yesterday morning, the Special District Court commissioned Prosecutor Guo to visit the office for an examination and instructed the deceased's wife, Zhi Pengshi, to sign a pledge to claim the body, provide a coffin, and await the arrest of the driver who caused the accident for interrogation.</p>

<h3 id="e172">Zhou Huanzhang and Wife in Protracted Litigation <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Verdict Scheduled for the 19th of This Month</p>
<p>Zhou Huanzhang, residing at No. 102, Siwen Li, Dagu Road, has been in the bamboo business. At the age of eight, he was betrothed to Xu, who was only seven years old at the time. They married at the age of nineteen and are now forty-three years old. They have a son named Dongquan, who is now twenty-four years old and studying at Great China University, and a second son, Dongxing, who is also twenty-two years old and studying at the Faculty of Law. They have an elderly mother at home, and in theory, the family should be harmonious and happy. However, the couple is now separated, the mother and sons rarely see each other, and the grandparents and grandchildren are often apart. Recently, his wife, Zhou Xushi, filed a complaint with the Special District Court, accusing him of neglecting support and demanding cohabitation. Her complaint stated that she was betrothed to the Zhou family at a young age and married at eighteen. However, the family was poor at the time, and her late uncle had a Zhou Yida bamboo shop. The plaintiff and defendant worked together to manage the shop, and after more than ten years of hard work, the situation improved, and they successively purchased more than thirty mu of land in Shanghai. Unfortunately, her late uncle passed away in 1920, and the defendant secretly cohabited with a certain woman. Since December 30, 1923, he has not stepped foot in the house for nine years. Although the eldest son was raised by an aunt, the second son was only twelve years old and the third daughter, A'gen, was only nine years old, and their upbringing and education required expenses. The daughter, seeing her husband's heartlessness, could only sigh and hope for his repentance. However, the defendant monopolized the family property, and the children's food and clothing depended on her ten fingers and the annual rent of 1,200 taels from the land on the Suzhou Riverbank on Maigen Road. Recently, her strength has declined, and the land has been sold by her husband for 50,000 to 60,000 taels. The tenant demanded the return of the rent fee of 1,000 taels, claiming that the lease term had not expired. He refused to pay for the children's schooling and living expenses, hence the lawsuit. In the first instance, the defendant failed to appear twice after being summoned, and the court ruled that the allegations were well-founded based on the evidence. The 1,000 taels of land rent was declared to be alimony due and was subject to provisional execution. The defendant Zhou Huanzhang, dissatisfied with the judgment, hired lawyer Yu Hualong to file an appeal. Yesterday was the joint hearing, and all parties were present. The grounds for the appeal stated that the appellant had land on the Suzhou Riverbank, which was privately leased by Zhou and received an annual rent of 1,200 taels, which she pocketed. Recently, the land was bought by the Public Works Bureau for road construction, and 1,000 taels had already been collected from the tenant in advance, which should be returned by Zhou. As for the alimony portion, when they separated in 1921, Zhou obtained the Zhou Yida North Shop, with inventory worth 7,000 to 8,000 yuan, plus the income from leasing the base over the years, which was considerable and sufficient for Zhou and her children's future living expenses. Moreover, there were eight rooms on Maigen Road, which could collect more than 70 yuan in rent per month, so it could not be said that he neglected support. Furthermore, after his father's death, Zhou wanted to drive out the appellant's mother, causing constant disturbances, which was the subject of a lawsuit in the former Mixed Court, leading to their separation. At that time, half of the family property, the Zhou Yida Bamboo Shop, was given to her to occupy exclusively for her livelihood, which could be said to be benevolent and righteous. As for the request for cohabitation, he also agreed. When his mother was summoned, she testified that after her husband's death, the son and daughter-in-law had disagreements and often quarreled, so her husband left behind the Zhou Yida North and South Bamboo Shops, and the son and daughter-in-law each lived in one shop. When the daughter-in-law returned, she would always quarrel and leave, and she bore the cost of the eldest grandson's tuition, etc. Then, his sons, Dongquan and Dongxing, were summoned and ordered to mediate, and they testified that the younger generation had no room to intervene in this matter and requested the court to handle it impartially. After further debate by both lawyers, the prosecutor's opinion was that the 1,000 taels of rent should be returned by the appellant, Zhou Huanzhang should give Zhou a monthly living allowance of 30 to 40 yuan, and the father should be responsible for the tuition of the two sons. The court announced that the verdict would be delivered on the 19th of this month.</p>

<h3 id="e174">Screening of Pornographic Films <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Mastermind Arrested After Being Discovered by Police</p>
<p>In Shanghai, all kinds of strange things emerge endlessly. The concession authorities conduct strict investigations but cannot completely eliminate them. Recently, Chinese and Western detectives from the Laozha Gate Police Station, based on secret reports from informants, discovered that the China Hotel behind the Xinxin Company on Guizhou Road often had unscrupulous individuals screening obscene pornographic films to attract tourists. The police investigated several times but did not obtain any real evidence. Until yesterday, Laozha Gate detective You Fugen discovered that several hooligans in Room 220 of the China Hotel had opened a room to screen this kind of obscene film. The police believed that if this kind of obscene drama was not quickly banned, it would be detrimental to public morals and security, and immediately ordered Chinese and Western detectives to arrest them. When they arrived, the perpetrators were crowded in a room, enjoying themselves, and their minds were muddled. The detectives arrested the masterminds, Kong Zhangfu and Lu Chunsheng, as well as three tea waiters and the projectionist, and seized a reel of film and a projector, and took them to the police station. The next morning, they were sent to the Special District Court for interrogation. Kong and Lu confessed that they were in the foreign goods business and lived at No. 766 Beijing Road. The judge said that since they were legitimate businessmen, they should not commit such illegal acts that harm society and ordered each of them to post 1,000 yuan in cash as bail, and sent the other two to the police station for detention, and scheduled a retrial for Thursday.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Two People Commit Suicide by Poison <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>㈠ On the 11th, a man from Suzhou checked into the Laodexing Inn at No. 155, McGao Baolu Road in the French Concession, claiming to be Yuan Mingzhi, 25 years old, and in the foreign goods business. He opened Room 1 and paid five dimes for the room, then closed the door and went to sleep. Yuan, feeling that the environment was bad, became tired of the world and committed suicide by smoking raw opium. At about 1 p.m. on the 11th, the tea waiter went to knock on the door, but there was no response after a long time. Knowing that something was wrong, he managed to pry open the door and saw Yuan's face was pale and his breath was weak. On the table in front of the bed, there was still a box of raw opium and six pieces of banana candy. He immediately reported to the accounting office, which reported to the Songshan Road Police Station. He was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment, but he died at 12:30 p.m. yesterday and was sent to the mortuary to await burial. ㈡ Li Baoming, 24 years old, from Pudong, was in the foreign goods business. At 9:30 p.m. the day before yesterday, he pre-purchased opium and opened Room 6 at the Fuxing Inn at No. 70, Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, paying five dimes for the room, then closed the door and went to bed. At 10 a.m. yesterday, the tea waiter heard a miserable groan from the room and knew that something was wrong. He broke down the door and entered, and saw Li lying stiffly in bed, his face pale and unable to speak. Knowing that he had taken poison, he reported to the accounting office, which reported to the Songshan Road Police Station. He was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment, but he died at about 1 p.m. and was sent to the forensic examination office to await examination.</p>

<h3 id="e177">The Businesses on Limalu and Dadatou Submit a Document to the Municipal Government <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Requesting a Postponement of House Demolition</p>
<p>The businesses on Limalu and Dadatou in Nanshi have been notified by the Land and Public Works Bureau to demolish their houses by a certain deadline. They believe that the deadline is too short and that they will not be able to relocate in time, and there is nowhere to move to. They have submitted separate documents to the Municipal Government and the Land and Public Works Bureau, stating: "We are submitting this document to request that you take into consideration the difficulties of the businesses and the livelihoods of the workers, and postpone the demolition of the houses so that we can make amends. We, the businesses located on Limalu and Dadatou, have been operating for many years. We have read the announcements issued jointly by your bureau and the Land (Public Works) Bureau, and we have also received notices stating that the project to reorganize the road line on the northern section of Limalu and the eastern section of Dadatou is very important and should be widened as soon as possible so that it can be completed. It is now stipulated that all houses on this road must be demolished by the end of June of this year so that construction can begin. We understand that the houses we rent are all to be demolished. We admire your government (bureau)'s efforts to build and revitalize the city. However, we must also ask you to consider the difficulties of the businesses and the importance of the livelihoods of the workers. According to Shanghai custom, landlords must notify businesses and tenants at least three months or half a year in advance if they want them to move so that they can prepare. However, the date we received the notice from the landlord is only one month before the stipulated deadline. We are very alarmed by this urgency. Shanghai is a densely populated city, and it is difficult to find hundreds of empty houses at the same time. Even if we find a few houses, it will be impossible to complete the procedures for negotiating prices, moving goods, and clearing accounts in time. Moreover, the location of the market may not be suitable for business. If hundreds of businesses are demolished, they will inevitably close down, and the thousands of workers they employ will lose their jobs. The construction project is huge and will not be completed in a short time. For a long time, the families of those who rely on their daily income will have nowhere to turn. The livelihoods of thousands of people are at stake and cannot be ignored. Each business has goods in storage, which is where their capital lies, and they cannot be abandoned. Even if there is a place to store them, fresh goods will spoil if stored for a long time, and goods that can be stored for a long time rely on brisk sales to turn over their costs. Otherwise, they will have no source of income and disputes will inevitably arise. Furthermore, the accounts that each business has extended this year are not small. Once the stores are closed, how will they be collected? All of these matters concern the capital of the businesses and the financial stability of the market. We, the businesses, are compelled to discuss this matter together and want to find a place to move so that the thousands of workers will not be completely displaced, the extended accounts can be recovered, and the losses will not be too great. We sincerely request that you consider the difficulties of the businesses and allow us to postpone the demolition until the end of February of next year (i.e., after the end of the current year's accounting) and then begin the demolition and construction in stages, so that both municipal administration and business conditions can be taken into account. We are eagerly awaiting your orders." This document is respectfully submitted by Zhang, the Mayor of Shanghai Municipality, Zhu, the Director of the Land Bureau, and Shen, the Director of the Public Works Bureau, as well as Fengtai, Yuanlai, Tonghe, Zhisheng, Yufeng, Yuanfeng, Huichang, Yuanyucheng, Heta, Hongchangyu, Changyu, Shunji, Fahe, Hengji, Hengyuan, Wancheng, Shentai, Chunmaohe, Wanxing, Yongda, etc.</p>

<h3 id="e179">New Weights and Measures System Implemented in This City <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Inspections Began the Day Before Yesterday</p>
<p>Concession Authorities Assisting in Implementation</p>
<p>There are many types of weights and measures in China. Not only are there differences between different regions and industries, but even within the same region and industry, there is no consistency. This has caused deep-seated problems that affect the livelihood of the people and are of great consequence. Previously, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce convened a meeting of provinces and cities to discuss the implementation of a new system of weights and measures, promulgated regulations, and ordered all provinces and cities to comply accordingly. This city is promoting the aforementioned new system, and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has urged the Weights and Measures Verification Office to actively proceed according to a uniform procedure. Currently, the uniformity of various vegetable markets in the city has begun. It is reported that the Verification Office, together with the public security organs, sends police to inspect each one every day. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency, believing that this matter concerns municipal construction and wanting to understand the implementation situation, visited the Verification Office on Xieqiao Manufacturing Bureau Road to observe its contents. There were countless large and small weighing instruments stored inside. The staff of the office were very busy, working an extra hour each morning and evening (7 a.m. to 6 p.m.). The following is an excerpt from an interview with the director of the office, Zhou: (Reporter asks) What is the new system? (Answer) There are two systems in the new system: one is the standard system, which adopts the international metric system, and the other is the municipal system, which is suitable for civilian habits. (Question) What is the difference between the municipal system and the standard system? (Answer) The standard system is the French system, which is very convenient for decimal calculation. However, it is somewhat different from civilian habits, so a municipal system that is most convenient for conversion with the standard system has been formulated. The municipal system is also known as the one-two-three system, that is, one standard liter is equal to one municipal liter, one standard jin is equal to two municipal jin, and one standard chi is equal to three municipal chi, hence the name one-two-three system. In fact, the standard system and the municipal system are one and two and three and one. Moreover, the relationship between the two is very easy to remember. (Question) How much does the municipal system differ from the old weights and measures? (Answer) There are too many types of old systems, with different sizes and weights. Therefore, when people usually say a few jin, they must specify what kind of scale and how many jin, otherwise it is impossible to know its absolute weight or quantity. Therefore, I can only answer what kind of old weights and measures it is equivalent to and how much, otherwise it is impossible to be clear. Generally speaking, one municipal chi is equal to 9.37 inches of a tailor's ruler, one municipal hu is equal to 8.452 dou of a sea hu, one municipal jin is equal to 12.988 qian of a Sima scale, 15.15 qian of a guild scale, and 13.64 fen of a balance scale. (Question) Has the vegetable market been changed to the new system? (Answer) The original plan was to start using new instruments in the vegetable market on June 1. The day before yesterday, inspectors were sent to inspect the Tangjiawan and Hongqiao vegetable markets together with the police from the Public Security Bureau. The results were very good. In the past, buyers often used heavy scales, which often led to disputes between buyers and sellers. Now there is a uniform method, and all the vendors in the vegetable market welcome it. (Question) There are very few factories and shops in this city that manufacture weights and measures. If new instruments are used one day, will there be a shortage of supply? (Answer) You are right. This is an unavoidable thing in the transitional era. However, the Social Affairs Bureau and our office have long foreseen this and have been urging the manufacturing factories and shops to prepare early this year. However, the merchants were waiting and watching, so there was not much inventory. Two months ago, the Municipal Government allocated funds to recruit merchants to jointly establish a Weights and Measures New Instrument Manufacturing Factory Co., Ltd. to engage in manufacturing and sales. Only then did the shops dare to boldly manufacture new instruments in large quantities. Currently, the company has accumulated more than 20,000 large and small lever scales, which are currently sufficient to meet the needs of various vegetable markets. One side is rushing to build, and our office is afraid that the shops will take the opportunity to raise prices, so we have specifically stipulated uniform prices and strictly prohibited hoarding. (Question) Are these new instruments sold by various factories outside? (Answer) Yes, but the production capacity of each shop owner is weak and there is not much inventory. They are not as well-funded and large-scale as the company established by the Municipal Government. If you want to order goods, you can contact them directly. The company's office is located in our office, which is more convenient. (Question) Is the price of the company the same as the price of each factory? (Answer) Completely the same. (Question) The date for the city's uniformity is approaching. Will it be handled uniformly in the Special Zone within the time limit in the future? (Answer) Regarding the implementation of the new system in the Special Zone, we have discussed with the authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession, the Chinese Taxpayers' Association, and the Special District Court several times. The implementation method is generally no problem. After all, there are precedents in various countries for uniform weights and measures. Our office will carry out the national laws and regulations and will of course proceed consistently. Now the concession authorities have expressed their support for the implementation.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Record of the Joint Meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees of the Lawyers Association <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Eighty-First Meeting</p>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association convened its 81st joint meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees at 8 p.m. last night. The attending committee members were Chen Zemin, Shan Yuhua, Zhang Enhuao, Cai Nipei, Zhao Yuhuang, Tang Yingsong, Yu Zhongluo, Li Shirui, Tan Yigong, Zhao Zuwei, Zhang Feixiong, Liu Zuwang, and others. Li Shirui was elected as the chairman, and Dai Jixian recorded the proceedings. After the formalities, the proposed resolutions were recorded as follows: ㈠ The chairman reported on the situation of attending the Lawyers Association in Hangzhou this time, stating that the representatives of the Lawyers Association proposed many important resolutions this time. The resolutions proposed by our association were passed, except for the Notary Public Law, which was not sympathized with due to conflicts with the legislative intent of the Legislative Yuan and the notary public laws of the United States and Britain. In addition, it was resolved to organize the International Lawyers Association and elect our association as the chief of the preparatory committee. The intention was to achieve the goal of abolishing consular jurisdiction in the International Association. Regarding the expenses, it cost 70,000 to 80,000 yuan to hold meetings in the Philippines and Japan in the past, while it is proposed to prepare 200,000 yuan in our country. This amount is not small, and it is proposed that the government bear the preparatory expenses, first agreeing to 5,000 yuan. This amount will be used to publish various legal books in our country for the purpose of promoting the Chinese legal system, which will be borne by the Shanghai, Hangzhou, Beiping, and Jiangning associations and paid in four installments. The location will be in Shanghai, and the Beiping Lawyers Association has many Japanese books, which were obtained from the International Lawyers Association meeting, and these books can be transferred to our association. Regarding this matter, the liaison with the government will be handled by Committee Member Chen Zemin, and the minutes of the first preparatory meeting of the International Lawyers Association were submitted for discussion. Then, Committee Member Chen Zemin reported on the process of contacting Foreign Minister Wang Rutang in Beijing, who was willing to help, and supplemented that our country had previously prepared to open the International Lawyers Association and had initially obtained the consent of more than 20 countries around the world, but it was not implemented due to funding problems. Moreover, the criminal law issue has changed slightly, and the world's criminal law is more inclined to the criminal law of Siam. However, this criminal law is based on our country's ancient criminal law as a blueprint, while our country adopts the Western five major legal systems of the Chinese legal system, which has fallen into obscurity. Therefore, there is an opportunity to launch this conference and promote the Chinese legal system as much as possible. After Tan Yigong, Li Shirui, Cai Nipei, Zhang Feixiong, and others expressed their opinions, it was resolved that this case is an important relationship. The minutes of the first preparatory meeting of the International Lawyers Association were passed and submitted to the extraordinary general meeting on the 14th of this month for decision. ㈡ The Jiangsu Higher Court instructed to interpret legal ambiguities. If it is a matter of personal qualifications, it is not appropriate to forward the request for interpretation. It was resolved that cases of interpretation of legal ambiguities will not be listed in the name of individuals in the future to avoid non-compliance with the conditions. ㈢ The Shanghai District Court Procuratorate issued an order to investigate whether lawyer Gu Yongquan's practice outside the district violated the Lawyers' Regulations. It was resolved to send a letter to member Gu to reply. ㈣ The Anhui Shanghai Fellow Association reported that an American sailor stabbed a fellow villager and requested that the association negotiate. It was resolved to introduce member Wu Jingxiong to provide voluntary assistance and send a letter to the association for verification. ㈤ The China National Products Commercial Market reported that British imperialists were oppressing and blockading the commercial market on the pretext and requested assistance. It was resolved to hand it over to the Standing Committee for handling and send a letter to the commercial market for verification. ㈥ Lawyers Shen Chenju, Yang Liufeng, Wen Zhenlin, Mao Yun, Sha Yunxiang, Xia Xunqi, and Hu Yuanteng applied for membership. It was resolved to pass. ㈦ Member Ni Gang reported that the fifth district and third branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau insulted a lawyer and requested that the Municipal Public Security Bureau investigate. It was resolved to hand it over to the Standing Committee for handling. The meeting adjourned late at night after the discussions.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Navigation Administration Actively Preparing <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>The Bureau Address Has Now Been Found</p>
<p>Registration and Inspection Matters</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Communications appointed Xi Dingmo as the director of the Shanghai Navigation Administration, preparations have been underway and are exceptionally busy. The current status of preparations and the outline of the internal organization are recorded below:</p>
<p>Recent Preparations According to Xi's interview with a reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency yesterday, after I was ordered, I immediately started planning and proceeding. Since this is the first time that our country has officially established a Navigation Administration, the first difficulty I felt was the issue of talent. In our country, there are very few excellent navigation administration talents, and even those with slightly more experience are not many. After I searched in many ways, I reluctantly found three or four people. The office location has now been found on the second floor of the new building at No. 6 Sichuan Road, Aiduya Road. The building is still under construction and is expected to be completed around the 20th of this month. Once it is completed, I plan to start arranging it. As for the transfer of the Shipping Administration Bureau of the Customs Service, the Ministry of Communications has consulted the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Finance has ordered the Customs to handle the handover. Once the Navigation Administration is officially established, it can be taken over.</p>
<p>Organizational Outline Regarding the internal organization, in addition to the director, there are two section chiefs and eight technicians. According to the provisions of the Maritime Law, they will handle maritime affairs, and the most important of these are about four types: ㈠ Registration, regardless of whether it is a Chinese or foreign ship, its tonnage, draft, and pilots and seafarers must be registered with the Navigation Administration for assessment. ㈡ Inspection, the equipment of the ship, the weight of the cargo, the qualifications of the driver, etc., must be inspected by personnel when entering and leaving, and a permit must be issued before allowing travel. ㈢ Nationality Passport, ships of all countries have nationality passports, but our country only has ministerial passports. The nationality passport is still lacking. In the future, if our country's shipping industry wants to develop abroad, this procedure is indispensable. Therefore, after the Navigation Administration is established, it must handle this work. ㈣ Measurement, in the future, the length and width of ships must be measured to check the amount of its capacity. In addition, the drawings of newly built ships must be submitted to the bureau for approval in advance, etc., which are more important.</p>

<p>Notice of Registration in the Concession</p>
<p>Fundraising for Emergency Relief in Jiangxi</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Medicine Association issued a circular yesterday to all members, saying: "Dear colleagues, because you are very busy with your medical practices, you cannot often attend meetings. Now we are notifying you in writing of the matters that should be brought to your attention: ㈠ Those practicing medicine or operating branch clinics in the French Concession must register with the French Municipal Council. The registration fee is two silver dollars. Any members residing or running branch clinics in the French Concession who have not yet registered with the French Municipal Council are requested to bring their health bureau licenses to the Association. For the convenience of its members, the Association can handle the registration on their behalf. ㈡ Colleagues residing outside the French Concession who wish to make house calls in the French Concession must, according to the original regulations, also register. However, after efforts of the Association's negotiation, it has been agreed that registration is not necessary. However, each person must have a small license with a two-and-a-half-inch photo of themselves. Those who wish to make house calls in the French Concession should prepare a two-and-a-half-inch photo and a stamp fee of one dime. Please send the year and number of the health bureau license to the Association, and the Association can obtain it from the health bureau on your behalf for your convenience, free of charge. ㈢ The Public Concession is also planning to implement registration. The Association has negotiated with them several times, with the aim of reducing the inconvenience and burden on colleagues, but no satisfactory result has yet been achieved. However, if you urgently need to register now, the Association can also submit the application on your behalf, with a registration fee of two taels of silver per person. ㈣ Currently, about thirty or forty letters issued by the Association have been returned due to changes of address of members. Please notify the Association of your new location when you move in the future so that we can make corrections. ㈤ The Modern National Medicine journal published by the Association was originally intended to be sent to members, but the printing and postage costs are more than two hundred dollars per issue, which the Association cannot afford. We have no choice but to collect a small fee to cover the costs. The Association has now received several valuable manuscripts that cannot be bought elsewhere, and will be included successively starting from the third issue. If you want to buy them, you will only be charged half price, one silver dollar for twelve issues per year. The Association will mail them to you issue by issue upon receipt of the subscription fee. ㈥ Twenty-four students graduated from the Chinese Medical College run by the Association during the summer, and their results were excellent. If any of you have children or relatives who wish to study medicine, you can introduce them to the school. The Chinese Hospital run by the Association has been registered with the Social Affairs Bureau. Factories are notified that if workers are sick, they can obtain half-price consultation vouchers from the Social Affairs Bureau for treatment. Therefore, there is a very high volume of patients. Due to the provision of medicine, the expenses are very large. The funding of the two institutions is the responsibility of the Board of Directors organized by the Association. Among our colleagues or your relatives, there are many who are public-spirited and charitable. We hope that everyone will donate as they see fit, or do their best to solicit donations, and deliver the funds to the respective institutions on Huangjia Que Road in Ximen, or to the Association for forwarding. ㈦ The Shanghai Emergency Relief Association for Jiangxi, chaired by Xiong Shihui, has notified us that the common bandits in Jiangxi are rampant, and the people are displaced and facing starvation, so they are organizing emergency relief. In addition to the Association's colleagues participating as initiators in their individual capacities, if any of our colleagues are financially well-off and enthusiastic about charity, they may wish to donate according to their ability. Please deliver the funds to the Shanghai Emergency Relief Association office inside the Red Cross Society at the east end of Wangping Street on Second Malu."</p>
<h3 id="e184">Preparing for the Reorganization of the Shanghai Chinese Medicine Association <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Medicine Association, originally located in the Chinese Medicine Specialized School in Shipi Lane in the city, has been suspended for several months. Recently, it obtained a permit from the City Party Department for Civil Training for reorganization. A meeting of former supervisors and committee members was specially convened on the evening of the day before yesterday at Mr. Ding's residence in Renheli, Baker Road. Xie Liheng and He Yunsheng presided over the meeting, reported on the progress, discussed the reorganization method, and publicly elected Xie Liheng, Ding Zhongying, Ding Jiwan, Dai Dafu, He Yunsheng, Yu Hongsun, Chen Yaotang, Yu Shunchen, Cao Weichun, Liu Zuotong, Chen Tiandun, and other seventeen people as preparation members. It was decided that the first preparatory meeting will be held on the 17th at the old office in Shipi Lane, and Xie Liheng was elected as the director of the preparation, responsible for convening the meeting.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Yesterday's News of the Guanghua Factory Labor Strike <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>All the workers of the Guanghua Dyeing and Weaving Factory on Luban Road in this city, due to resisting the oppression of the factory manager Gu Yongquan, incited public outrage and caused a dispute. More than one hundred labor unions in the city have jointly decided on various disposal measures, which are selected as follows: ㈠ Sending representatives to the party and government to petition. Yesterday morning, representatives Zhao Shusheng, Wang Wenhua, Lu Muqin, Gu Ruofeng, and others were specially sent to meet with Zhang Tinghao, section chief of the Social Affairs Bureau, and the Civil Training Association of the City Party Department, to express their extreme dissatisfaction with Gu Yongquan's oppressive behavior. They intend to stop him from working in Shanghai to avoid causing similar disputes. ㈡ Labor unions have donated funds to help. The Shanghai Postal Workers Union donated thirty yuan, the Shanghai Postal Workers Union donated ten yuan, the Water and Electricity Workers Union donated ten yuan, and other labor unions have also donated a considerable amount. ㈢ Joint Declaration (The Shanghai Labor Unions' Declaration on the Guanghua Dyeing and Weaving Factory Labor Strike is as follows: We, the more than 300 workers of the Guanghua Dyeing and Weaving Factory, unable to endure the trampling and oppression of the factory manager Gu Yongquan, stomp our feet and beat our chests, crying in pain and despair, almost falling into a situation where we cannot live or die. We and others have witnessed this with heartache. In order to save the dying workers and maintain the healthy development of the labor movement, we have to speak out righteously and report to all sectors of society. It is found that Gu Yongquan was originally a worker in a mercerized factory and one of the responsible persons of the former Mercerized Factory Union. (Omission) In March of this year, he resigned from his position in the labor union and jumped to become the factory manager. Within just over two months of taking office, he arbitrarily set unreasonable factory rules and treated workers harshly. More than 140 workers were given demerits for minor or even no reason, and more than 70 workers were fired. Our workers crawled under Gu Yongquan's licentious power, weeping silently and daring not to speak. Unfortunately, worker Zhu Linhou, on the day of this month, during working hours when the machine was in operation, his clothes were suddenly splashed with medicated soapy water. In order to prevent his clothes and skin from being burned, the worker took off his clothes and washed them himself. Unexpectedly, Gu Yongquan became angry and accused him of violating factory rules and neglecting work, and immediately fired Zhu Linhou. After repeated negotiations by the labor union, he was allowed to return to work, but he had to write a letter of repentance. However, on the day of this month, when Zhu Linhou went to work, Gu Yongquan again used the letter of repentance as an excuse, claiming that the wording did not match, and unreasonably forced Zhu Linhou to leave the factory, and even added unbearable insults. All the workers in the factory were unanimously indignant and expressed their resistance. Gu Yongquan concealed the military and political authorities and falsely accused them of riots and strikes, and successively reported to the Public Security Bureau and the Garrison Command. On the day of this month, seventeen innocent workers, including Jiang A'er, were arrested by the Public Security Bureau. Afterwards, the party and government sent personnel to investigate. We and others could not bear to sit idly by, so we urgently listed the crimes, urged the party and government organs to provide assistance, release the workers, and expel Gu Yongquan from the party, remove him from his post, and send him to the court to be dealt with according to the law for the crime of false accusation and concealment, so as to serve as a warning to those who are unrepentant. The Shanghai Postal Workers Union, the Publishing Industry Union, and more than one hundred other labor unions, 206, 13, the Shanghai Dyeing Industry Workers Union, and the Mercerized Factory held an emergency representative meeting yesterday, publicly electing Liu Jintai as chairman, and performing the rituals. (A) Reporting items: ㈠ The process of Guanghua Factory manager Gu Yongquan deliberately causing a labor strike; ㈡ The process of Yan A'er and other seventeen people from Guanghua Factory being arrested; ㈢ Gu Yongquan's coercion of workers to sign contracts; (B) Discussion and decision items: ㈠ The case of assisting the arrested comrades of the Guanghua Factory, decided to have all members of each factory petition to the higher authorities; ㈡ The case of expelling Gu Yongquan from the Guanghua Factory to ensure work stability, decided to submit a request to the higher authorities for investigation; ㈢ The case of how to handle the Guanghua Factory's forcible contract and oppression of workers, decided to unanimously deny and broadly request the higher authorities to immediately revoke it.</p>
<h3 id="e186">The Tariff Commission Requests Approval to Reduce Export Tariffs <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>The Various Industries Tariff Research Committee submitted a report to the National Government yesterday, requesting approval to reduce export tariffs on tung oil and other industries. The original report stated: "The report is submitted to request approval to reduce export tariffs on tung oil, tobacco leaves, firecrackers, and other industries, in order to maintain commerce and benefit the people. Since the promulgation of the new export tariffs, merchants and people of various industries have repeatedly telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, claiming that the burden has increased. However, the Ministry's reply was that the case had been reviewed and approved by the Legislative Yuan, and the National Government had issued a clear order for implementation, so the Ministry could not revise it, resulting in the tariff rate not being reduced, which has indeed affected the progress of export trade. This special summary report is hereby submitted to your government, requesting that it be forwarded for approval and reduction, and hoping that you will take note of it. ㈠ The export tariff rate for the tung oil industry has been increased by a huge amount of 2.56 times. At a time when the United States is vigorously planting tung trees and exports are being squeezed by Japan, the tax-paying price should be re-estimated and lightly revised to avoid repeating the mistakes of the silk and tea industries. ㈡ The export tariff rate for tobacco leaves is 7.5%, and each dan must pay one tael and seven qian, which is more than eleven times the old tax of one qian and five fen per dan. Moreover, the governments of various countries have repeatedly increased the import tax on Chinese tobacco leaves, and the export trade of domestic tobacco leaves has been severely hit. If a high export tax is levied domestically, it will be difficult to survive. It is requested that it be forwarded for light revision to maintain it. ㈢ The export tax on firecrackers is one tael and two qian per dan, which is more than seven qian more than the original tariff rate. Firecrackers are entirely handmade products, and millions of workers and merchants in the country rely on them for their livelihoods. The annual sales abroad are very large. Taking Annam as an example, according to French statistics in 1925, it was worth six million francs. Considering the government's main purpose of encouraging the development of handicrafts and foreign trade, it seems that it should be specially reduced, and the raw materials for the product are paper, nitrate, and sulfur, which have all been taxed, so the tariff rate should be further reduced to avoid affecting costs. It is reasonable to submit a written summary report to your government, hoping that you will review and approve it, and allow it to be forwarded for separate light revisions, in order to maintain commerce and benefit the people, which is very fair."</p>
<h3 id="e187">The Federation of Machine Industries Requests Exemption from Business Tax for the Paint Industry <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Federation of Machine Industries submitted a document to the Ministry of Finance, saying: "The report is submitted to truthfully forward the request for exemption from business tax. It is reported that the members Kailin, Yonggu, Yonghua, Zhenhua, and other four paint companies stated in their letters that they had previously read in the newspaper that the business tax rate for the Shanghai Municipality's draft manufacturing industry tax rate item was 10% of the capital amount. According to our companies' manufacture of paint, it has long been approved to be treated as machine-made foreign-style goods, and it is generally exempt from repeated taxation when transported and sold domestically, and completely exempt from taxation when exported abroad. It should be based on the original case, and we earnestly request your association to forward the request to the Ministry of Finance for exemption from business tax, which is really a matter of public interest. It is based on this, and it is found that the government is undertaking business tax in order to offset the tax revenue of likin. However, machine-made foreign-style goods approved in the original case can be exempted from likin, and should be exempt from business tax. It is found that the implementation of business tax in Shanghai Municipality is imminent, and the tax rate for the paint manufacturing industry is 10% of the capital amount, which does not seem to be in line with the government's intention to promote domestic goods and encourage industry. It is really necessary to submit a request for exemption, so this special report is submitted truthfully, hoping that your ministry will review and approve it, and allow the business tax for the paint manufacturing industry to be exempted from collection, in order to alleviate the difficulties of merchants and promote industry, which is very convenient. Respectfully presented to the Ministry of Finance of the Executive Yuan of the National Government) The Ministry of Finance's No. 12947 decree replied, "The report is noted. The city's business tax collection regulations should be consulted and verified by the Ministry, and after a decision is made, it will be forwarded for compliance." This approval (a separate document submitted to the municipal government is omitted)</p>

<p>Regarding the supervision of the Shanghai stock exchanges, after the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry announced the appointment of Mr. Chen Jian'an and Mr. Xu Jianping as exchange supervisors, the office of the exchange supervisors was officially established on the 4th of this month. Supervision of the exchanges has been carried out separately. The initial procedure is to first investigate the internal situation of each exchange, such as the regulations of each exchange, as well as the business methods and procedures, all of which are quite noteworthy. As for the future supervision matters, it will not be outside the scope of curbing manipulation to avoid confusing the market. Currently, there are only six exchanges in Shanghai. The most noteworthy are the Chinese Securities and the Commodity Securities exchanges. The commissioners assigned by the office to investigate the various exchanges are Mr. Xu Chao Hou, Mr. Bao Linmei, and Mr. Zhang Chengmo.</p>

<p>Guo Dianxiang, a native of Funing, who lived at No. 98 Beijing Jiang Road in Zha, has been in the second-hand goods business. He and his wife, Yuan, have been married for many years, and their relationship is still good. Guo has been plagued by illness in recent years, has been unemployed for several years, and is in extremely difficult financial straits. They are often worried about running out of food. Yuan is not accustomed to the cold and hardship. At first, she sighed that her life was thin and relied on the income from her ten fingers to maintain her livelihood. Then, feeling angry that her husband's chronic illness was not improving, she often said that it would be better to die than to live in suffering. Her husband had heard it so often that he didn't take it seriously. Unexpectedly, the night before last, they quarreled over a trivial matter. She went straight to the bedroom, found a hemp rope, tied it to the roof beam, and hanged herself. When Guo went inside, he saw that the light was off and was very surprised. Feeling around in the dark, he was shocked to find his wife's feet dangling in the air. He quickly lit a fire and saw that she was already dead. He held her body and wailed loudly. He was reported to the Fourth District General Office by his co-residents. Yesterday afternoon, an appointed prosecutor came to inspect the body and ordered it to be collected and buried first, while Guo was detained for questioning.</p>

<h3 id="e208">Remembering the Martyrs Liang Tingdong and Tingyue, Brothers Who Died for Their Cause <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Fang Chuqiu</p>
<p>The revolutionary wind, our Anhui sang it the earliest. It should be the Liang martyrs Tingdong brothers on the Huai River. The martyr's name is Shiqing. He lived in Shouxian, Anhui. He was benevolent and resolute. He liked to make friends and was chivalrous. In the late Qing Guangxu years, seeing that the country was declining day by day, he traveled around to make friends widely. Wherever he went, he always used the meaning of reform to guide people as the opportunity arose. He braved dangers and difficulties for more than ten years. When he arrived in Hebei, he said with emotion: Yan and Zhao have been known since ancient times for having many generous and tragic scholars. Although their atmosphere is closed, it can be opened with great righteousness. So he lived in Peiping. At that time, he was very close with officers and soldiers of the Yi Army. Many old comrades went to rely on him. When Qing Xuantong succeeded to the throne, Zai Feng was regent. Empress Dowager Longyu wanted to pursue the matter of the Wuxu coup and put Yuan Shikai on trial. The military and civilians were in a panic. The martyr secretly conspired with Yi Army comrades to take the opportunity to launch an uprising. It was leaked by those who were fond of profit. The government demanded it urgently. So he took the indirect route to Jilin, hid in Changchun, and changed his name to Liang Qingyu. Comrades continued to arrive. Because of insufficient funds, he sold articles for a living. His younger brother Tingyue, whose name was Zhuoqing, was naturally filial and friendly, excelled in languages, and was proficient in epigraphy, arithmetic, and music. Feeling that his brother's aspirations were not fulfilled, he used education to seek progress and advocated private school reform. He took on the role of professor without accepting a salary, and took pleasure in people's pleasure and worried about people's worries. After a long time, many friends and followers. Those who were jealous framed him. The county official suspected him. Although the disaster was hidden, his spirit was not diminished. Soon, he obeyed his mother's order to go to Changchun to meet his brother Tingdong. When he arrived, his third brother Tinghuai was already there. Tinghuai, also known as Bing, whose name was Yinqing, was a comrade of Tingdong from a young age. Earlier, the Xiong martyr Chengji launched an uprising in Anhui. After the defeat, he went to Japan and then to Jilin. Tinghuai conspired from Peiping and advocated righteousness in the three eastern provinces. Soon Xiong was sold by Zang Guansan and arrested. Tinghuai's Peiping residence was searched. Jilin Governor Chen Zhaochang secretly telegraphed the Qing court. The purchase and arrest were very urgent, but Tinghuai escaped upon hearing the news and went to Changchun. In the autumn of Xinhai, the Wuchang uprising broke out. The whole country responded. Tingdong and his brothers discussed with their comrades: The inland is gradually being restored. The three eastern provinces are important border areas. Zhao Erxun and others hold troops to consolidate themselves and plan to resist. If we do not quickly break it, they will surely support the small court and call on Manchuria and Mongolia, and use Japanese and Russian diplomacy to contain it. Although the Southern Army is strong, there will be worries that the whip is beyond its reach. It is appropriate to gather the people's army and raise the banner of righteousness to support the Central Plains. So comrades Liu Qianyi, Shang Zhen, etc. in Fengtian publicly elected Lan Tianwei as the Grand Governor of Guanwai, and the martyr Kun promoted the affairs of Jilin and Heilongjiang. The agency was set up in Harbin, and the documents of Sun President Li Vice President to the three eastern provinces were issued. They showed the comrades: This is a meeting for a great man to make contributions. Everyone was enthusiastic. They discussed with each other: The three eastern provinces are densely populated with mountains, and bandits come and go. Military and police are densely distributed. Today's affairs, the military and police without the encouragement of bandits, there is no chance to launch. Bandits without the surveillance of military and police, there is no way to control. We should use bandits to contain the military and police, and use military and police to control bandits. Everyone said it was good. So Tao Yuchun, Wang Wenfeng, etc. joined the police. Zhuang Yushu, Yao Xiuyun, etc. joined the army. Wang Zechen, Li Fanwu, etc. combined local groups. Gu Xiuzhai and others recruited bandits. So Tian Bianyang and others, a large number of Liu Han's people, sincerely accepted the agreement to wait. Li Jiaao, the chief of Binjiang Dao, and Yao Peizhen, the commander, all communicated with the funds. Tingyue then served as the foreign affairs official and obtained the recognition of neutrality from various consuls. They then pulled down the dragon flag and changed it to the five-color flag to celebrate the restoration. The Self-Government Office was established to convene officials, gentry, military police, merchants, scholars, and the common people to discuss government affairs, eliminate harsh taxes, release prisoners, and protect the people and merchants. The order was orderly. Qichang was not surprised. Everyone called long live. Zhao Erxun and others heard of it and hurriedly changed the flag to protect themselves. Later, they heard that the Qing court abdicated and the north and south ceased fighting. The Governor of Jilin, Chen Zhaochang, hoped to be the governor and was jealous of the partisans. He used the surrendered general Yao Peizhen as his old department. He instigated an unexpected attack on the people's army. The battle lasted all day. Ammunition was exhausted and reinforcements were cut off. Tingdong and Tingyue died in the end. Those who died together were Tao Yuchun, Wang Zechen, Li Fanwu, and more than ten others. The people's army in various places lost their leaders and mostly dispersed automatically. However, they still kept their promises not to disturb the people. And they agreed to change their behavior, saying: I can't bear to be the legacy of the Liang brothers. Binjiang has always been a place where bandits gather. Residents must be prepared when they go out. Only during the revolution did the bandits keep their promises and restrain themselves. The people of Binjiang still think about it today. Tingdong has a son, named Dazong. Tingyue has a son named Daxin. Both can inherit the legacy of their ancestors. And Tinghuai ran for the country and engaged in revolution. For thirty years, he has never slackened. But his family has declined because of this, to the point where he cannot afford food and clothing. Tinghuai did not care about it at all. He often said: Forgetting the family for the country, shouldn't a person of ambition be like this? His breadth of mind is like this. I am sad about the encounters of the two martyrs. I am even more impressed by Tinghuai's ambition. Therefore, I specifically present it to the world so that future generations can learn from it.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Remembering Yang Guifei's Lychee <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Chan Tui</p>
<p>Although I don't boast about my travels overseas, saying that my footprints have traveled all over China's famous mountains, and that my appetite has tasted the famous products of various places, but as far as the places I have been to, the word "half" in "footprints halfway around the world" still has room for maneuvering. Not to mention food. Just take lychee for example. I am from Sichuan, born in Beiping, grew up in Zhejiang, and have traveled north, south, east, and west. As long as I have free time, I say that two secretaries write manuscripts. This travelogue may be comparable to a famous mountain record.</p>
<p>I entered Sichuan with the army in the fifth year of the Republic of China and was stationed in Jialing in the sixth year of the Republic of China. The mountains and rivers of Jialing are the best in the world. Therefore, there is a conch-like couplet on the city gate. "Three hundred miles of Jialing, twelve buildings in the garden." Emperor Xuanzong of Tang entered Sichuan. He loved the mountains and rivers of Jialing. He once ordered Wu Daozi to draw three hundred miles of Jialing on a screen. The mountains and rivers of Jialing cannot be moved to Shanghai. When I say that the mountains and rivers of Jialing are dark green, it is just a sentence and cannot be confirmed. Even if there are photographic equipment, it can only obtain its appearance and cannot obtain its spirit. But because of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang's love for Wu Daozi's paintings, those who see it will surely believe it without words.</p>
<p>Let's talk about these twelve buildings. The first is the Phoenix Tower. It is the birthplace of the Golden Wheel Emperor of the Great Zhou Dynasty. This tower was specially built as a memorial. The tower is three feet high. There is a jade bell hanging on it. The jade bell is a rare treasure in the world. The words cast on the bell were all made by Empress Wu. It can be used for textual research.</p>
<p>The second is Yang Guifei Tower. Yang Guifei's father, Yang Yuanzhen, was the household secretary of Lizhou in Shu. Lizhou is now Zhongxian. The tower is behind the prefectural office. According to legend, it is the residence of the household secretary. Yang Guifei once planted hundreds of lychee trees herself. Now it is still a garden. The lychee has a red line in the middle of the waist, so it is also called "One Pinch of Red." Yang Guifei entered the palace and was made a noble concubine. Emperor Xuanzong specially ordered the governor of Lizhou to set up post relays. Therefore, there is a poem by the Tang people: "A rider of red dust smiles for the concubine. No one knows that lychee is coming." That is, Hong Fangsi's Palace of Eternal Life has a long tune singing about Yang Guifei's lychee. It can be seen that Yang Guifei's lychee is a famous product of Sichuan.</p>
<p>In May of the seventh year of the Republic of China, I once served as the acting governor of Zhongxian. I was in office for forty-seven days. What political achievements can be said? But for Yang Guifei's lychee, the garden is behind the tree, and it is produced every other year. The days I was in office were just when the lychee was first ripe. If it were in the former Qing Dynasty, it would have been a tribute. The county official would have been exhausted. How dare he eat one? Now it is the Republic of China. The county official is bigger than an ox. The agricultural products of the four villages can still be forcibly owned by the officials. Not to mention the lychee of this office. Every time I had free time, I invited three or five colleagues to cook wine in the garden and pick fresh lychee from the trees. The beauty of the color and taste, and the freshness of the water, truly deserve the name of Yang Guifei. Every time I eat it, I can get hundreds of them. Comparing it with the lychee sold in Shanghai, the difference is no less than that between heaven and earth. That's why I bought a basket of lychee today when I entered the market. Although it is said to be fresh fruit that has just arrived in Shanghai, it is not as delicious as the fresh lychee picked from the trees.</p>

<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Zhang Xiao San'er said. "Okay, the police look down on me. Even my own wife looks down on me. I rented the house. I paid the rent. Why do you dare to lock the door and not let me in?" Speaking, he kicked the door with one foot. With a thud, it kicked open. He jumped in. He stared at her and said. "You eat my food. You drink my drink. You dare to quarrel with me. I'm going to beat you. Anyway, rickshaw pullers can't beat the police. At worst, we'll go to the police station together." He scolded all the way. He walked in all the way. He saw the white stove against the wall. The fire was burning brightly. The small iron pot on top had a layer of steamer. There was a rattling sound in the pot. A burst of white steam rushed out. From this white steam, there was a smell of corn bread. Seeing this, the corn bread was steaming in the pot. It was about to be cooked. Zhang Xiao San's stomach was starving. When he smelled this smell, he couldn't help but drool. So he walked forward. He lifted the steamer lid. He saw the heat filled the air. More than a dozen fist-sized corn breads were steaming in the steamer. They were golden yellow. He brushed a layer of soda on it. It showed that it was steamed through. He pulled a pair of chopsticks from the chopstick holder on the wall. Just as he was about to insert it into the steamer. Zhang Er Sao grabbed it. She covered the steamer and pressed it with her hand. Don't be busy. I ask you. Did you throw down the money to buy corn flour yesterday? (Note: Corn flour is the powder ground from corn. It is used to make corn bread.) Zhang Xiao San said. "What if I didn't?" Zhang Er Sao said. "That's it. You said I eat your food. I wear your clothes. This shows that I didn't eat your food. This is the money I made from sewing work in the tailor shop. (Note: All work is generally called work in plain language, such as a barber going out to shave heads is called external work.) You are eating my food. What should I do?" Zhang Xiao San said. "You eat my food every day. It's nothing for me to eat one meal from you." Zhang Er Sao said. "Eat one meal. You calculate. How many meals have you eaten from me in the past ten days? You have money to go to the teahouse. Listen to the storytellers' nonsense. When you get home, Xue Rengui's expedition to the east. Huang Tianba's marriage proposal. You still have to learn it for three days and three nights. You are in your twenties and thirties. You still need your wife to support you." She rambled on and on. She said this long paragraph. Her hand was still pressing the steamer lid. She didn't let Zhang Xiao San lift it. Zhang Xiao San took a short stool. He stuffed it under his butt. He squatted down. He sat down. He saw Zhang Er Sao standing there. She raised her hands. She reached out to touch the messy hair on her head. She raised her two big sleeves. It revealed her two big white breasts. They hung down in a daze. He couldn't help but laugh. Zhang Er Sao saw him smile. She had more confidence. She held a broken rattan chair. She sat diagonally to him. She held the hem of her clothes with both hands. She turned it upwards. She fanned it like a fan. The higher she fanned it. The hem of her clothes turned up. It revealed her navel.</p>
<h3 id="e211">A Comparative Study of "The Liar" <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Yun Xian</p>
<p>The famous play by the Fudan Drama Society in its 11th public performance.</p>
<p>In the plot of Jones's "The Liar," the author's soul is hidden. And this magical soul plays a smiling character. He proclaims to the masses all over the world. Divorce is unfortunate. Lying is impossible. Lin Wangxian, who has experienced the world and tasted all kinds of hardships and advises his infatuated friend Zhang Jingkai to turn back, is clearly the author himself who has seen through the hearts of the world. Lin Wangxian here believes that seducing a married woman, although it is out of a sacred spiritual love, is also inappropriate. It seems that Jones, who is Zhang Jingkai, is a moralist who wears the mask of etiquette and teaches. Free love, in the present era, is a sacred event recognized by everyone. It should not be subject to any oppression. Whether she or he is a married woman or a married man. If there is no love between husband and wife, then this marriage built on dead love does not need to be maintained. If all the clear-headed people think this way. Then, in this way, Jones is a member of the old era with a corrupt mind. There is no need to perform his works again today.</p>
<p>But it is not so.</p>
<p>What kind of person is Jones? Is he a maintainer of old etiquette? Slowly. Please turn over and read "Magal and His Lost Angel," which was created two years earlier than "The Liar." This script directly attacks the old etiquette. It attacks the church with blood. The attack on the old etiquette and old morality in "Magal and His Lost Angel" is ten times more intense than the criticism of the impropriety of divorce in "The Liar."</p>
<p>The author in "The Liar" has no sympathy for Zhang Jingkai, who is wholeheartedly and sincerely in love, and drives others into the sea of ​​bitter love and cannot be saved. At the end of the fourth act, the audience fully sympathizes with and is moved by Zhang Jingkai's distress at this time, when his lover suddenly leaves without saying goodbye. They even feel sorry for him. But the author finally sends him to Nanyang, where there is only bitter heat and hard work. In such a place, the author fully shows that he is a cold and unfeeling person. But please also read "Magal and His Lost Angel," gentlemen who think so. The author in this book, from the same pen, is full of enthusiasm for life.</p>
<p>Now. Comparing the two immortal masterpieces that Jones contributed to the world of drama at the same time. We only understand that he is not a maintainer of old morality. He is not an unfeeling and indifferent person. Then we have to ask. Why in "The Liar." The author showed the opposite tendency to that in "Magal and His Lost Angel." If I am allowed to make a judgment in the following sentence. This is the opposite writing method of the great writer Jones. It is the place where his skills change. It is also his perverted means.</p>
<p>In any case. The author said the following through Lin Wangxian's mouth. It is the only loud warning to the men and women in China who are currently in the divorce craze.</p>
<p>"Don't think that once you get married. You can leave your wife alone and not care about her. You can't. You have now married the most beautiful woman in Shanghai. But if you don't continue to love her. Someone else will love her. There is nothing to say. This is the tragedy of life." (Min Shi's note: The play has been translated and directed by Mr. Zhu Duanjun of the Fudan Drama Society. It will be performed at the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Association on the thirteenth and fourteenth of this month. The Fudan Drama Society is well-known. This performance is its eleventh.)</p>

<p>With slight fluctuations, the bullion decline wind did not stop yesterday, the 13th. There were slight ups and downs. It fluctuated by several taels of money in half a day. In the end, it fell by more than four taels. The forward rate approached, and the bulls sold off. The silver market continued to rise. The opening was low, and it had broken the 800-tael mark. As for the foreign exchange trend, it was still loose, but the quoted price did not move. People's hearts were floating, and the big sellers were excited, but the Guangdong group and the shorts took advantage of this low price and dragged it in. Therefore, the market price fluctuated by two to four or five taels. The situation was complicated, and it seemed to be tortuous. In the end, it was around 798 taels. The market will be closed on Saturday. Checking the situation this week, it was unpredictable. The maximum price was 815 taels and 1 qian, and the minimum price was 789 taels. There was a difference of 26 taels and 5 qian. The total increase was still 5 taels.</p>
<p>Down 4 taels and 6 qian. The July opening fell by 4 taels and 9 qian, to 797 taels and a half. Almost all major items rose by 1/16. The silver market rose by 1/8, the private telegram rose by 3/16, and the European market was still stable. The buyers did not slacken. Therefore, it affected the Shanghai market, falling to 7 taels and 8 qian. Daxing, Yongyu, Dazhi, Feng, Yongheng, Xingyuan, etc. all sold out. It continued to fall by 2 or 3 taels, to 95 taels. Before long, Qianchang, Xiang, Tong, Taichang, Wanxingsheng, Dahengli, etc. came in, and it immediately rose by more than 3 taels. The exchange market was first absorbed by banks, totaling 3125 British gold, so it rose to 98 taels and 5 qian. After entering, it was slightly inferior by more than 1 tael. The first order was announced and not changed, at 96 taels, 7 qian to 7 taels and 3 or 4 qian. Bingxing, Tianfa, Yongyuan, Mao, Yongqian, Changxiang, Yuanxing, Yongheng, Xingyuan, etc. all sold out. However, the domestic British gold market was still fair. Zhengjin Mitsui absorbed July 3125. At 9:30, it fell to 95 taels and a half. Suddenly, the Dalian gang and Yuancheng, Hengyu chased in, adding slightly to 2 taels. After 10 o'clock, it was 97 taels and 7 qian. However, Hengxingyuan's selling intention was very strong. Zhifeng, Yongshenchang, Yong and other items came to sell. It was even more difficult to sell British gold 3125. It fell by 3 taels in one go, to 94 taels at 10:30. Again, because Shanghai Zhengjin had eaten July and August British gold 375 to 3125. And Chenfeng, Yongyu, Chengyong, Yuanheng, Yu, Dazhifeng, Yongfeng, Yuanmaoyong, etc. dragged in one after another. So the price jumped by more than 5 taels, to 99 taels and 4 qian at 11:15. In a moment, it went down a little to 1 tael, to 8 taels and 2 qian. Then, because the banks mutually traded British gold 25 to 3125, it rose by 1 tael. Around 11:30, it was 99 taels and 3 qian. The Dalian gang sold out, depreciating by more than 1 tael. However, there were ups and downs of more than 1 tael at times. At noon, it only counted 97 taels and 3 qian. People's hearts were flustered, and they were uncertain about whether to advance or retreat. At noon, the closing price was 97 taels and 1 qian, continuing to be 7 taels and a half to 8 taels. Compared with the previous day, it fell by 4 taels and 6 qian. (According to the listed price) According to the half-day, the maximum price was 99 taels and 4 qian, and the minimum price was 94.

<p>The yarn market was calm, with a slightly softening trend. The atmosphere in the market relaxed slightly after a large long position was closed out yesterday. Rumors of a major merchant exiting the market also circulated, causing anxiety among small investors, who mostly expected prices to fall. As a result, the market appeared soft again. However, actual sales were good overall, although some slow-moving goods remained unsold, putting pressure on sellers. Japanese yarn prices continued to rise steadily, and supplies were tightening daily. 16s and 20s yarns remained scarce. Shenxin 20s "Ren Zhong" yarn was bought by Dongyang for 100 bales at 178 taels, duty-free for export. Transactions continued uninterrupted.</p>
<p>People's Standard Yarn fell by 4-5 qian. At the opening of the People's Standard Yarn market, there were many rumors about the current situation, and there was a lack of buyers. Prices fell by 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 qian. In the afternoon, prices rose slightly by 2, 3, and 4 qian. The total volume traded was 13,350 bales. Sales included 1,000 bales by Senkang, 800 bales by Changfeng, 600 bales by Yichang, and 750 bales by Deji. Purchases included 500 bales by Gongtai, 1,400 bales by Shenda, and 300 bales by Shenyu. The closing prices are recorded on the left:</p>

<p>The cotton market remained firm because US cotton trends were stable and local inventories were low, so the situation remained stable. However, some expected prices to fall slightly, but the lack of incoming goods made it difficult for prices to decline. The future was difficult to predict.</p>
<p>Hankou Standard Yarn settled down. At the opening of the Hankou Standard Yarn market, the atmosphere was flat. Near-term prices fell by 5 fen, and far-term prices fell by 2 qian, 5 fen.

<p>US cotton was bought by fellow traders yesterday and remained firm, then weakened due to the closing of long positions, and finally strengthened again due to strong support from Wall Street. Futures prices rose by 2-7 points, and spot prices rose by 5 points. British cotton futures rose by 3 points, and spot prices rose by 10 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 20 points. The Indian cotton market was firm, strengthening first due to short covering and speculative buying, and then weakening due to profit-taking by long positions. July and August White Rowcliffe were stronger due to rumors of a monopoly. Fairgrieves and Oomra rose by 5 rupees, and White Rowcliffe rose by 8 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated the 12th):</p>

<p>A New York dispatch from the 12th reported on the cotton market during the week. At the beginning of the week, the cotton market reached new lows due to the weakness of the securities market and favorable reports on the southern climate. Those who had bought futures sold them again during the recent rebound, but the decline in value did indeed increase the demand from domestic and foreign traders, and short covering also caused prices to rise. The current market is certainly below cost, so price declines are sufficient to attract purchases by long positions, but buyers rarely indicate that they will follow the upward trend when prices rise. The climate in the cotton region is generally favorable, and cotton production is progressing well. However, there are many reports of bollworms in Garu Lana and southern Texas, which are said to be a major threat to the new cotton crop, and this is causing great concern. The closing of long positions for July futures was absorbed by spot traders to cover their short positions in far-month contracts.</p>

<p>Yesterday's market at Xinzha remained stagnant. Few stores opened in the morning, and appetite was even weaker. The opening price gradually declined, with weak buying leading to lower prices, indirectly affecting cargo by boat. Continuous arrivals from the west increased supply, but with the Dragon Boat Festival approaching, firms were settling accounts and the river storage was full. The hot weather made it difficult to store cargo for long, and rice was prone to heating, so the market lacked vitality. Medium and lower grades of Northern Japonica rice saw the least trading, with prices dropping by 0.2-0.3 yuan. Early and late rice, as well as foreign rice, were neglected, and prices fell by 0.1-0.2 yuan. Sales of white yuan rice were slow, and the trend continued downward.</p>
<p>Yesterday in South Shanghai, 16th and 17th grade rice arrived from the lower river region, but sales were sluggish. Changshu and Xixi premium japonica rice and Suzhou white japonica rice continued to decline, with premium rice down 0.2 yuan and lower grades down 0.4 yuan. The decline in early and late rice slowed, with opening prices down around 0.3 yuan. Foreign dujian rice was not in short supply, and medium and lower grades saw the most improvement in trading. White yuan rice sold well, and the trend was unlikely to loosen. Buying was weak and sales were flat. Arrivals from Anhui and Jiangxi were dwindling, and inventory was limited. Sporadic trading was minimal, and prices were uniquely stable.</p>
<h3 id="e222">Improved Outlook for Flour Futures <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday in the flour market, after the opening in the morning, the market for each month was good due to favorable weather and a shift in sentiment among inland traders. Although foreign wheat prices had rebounded by around 0.2-0.4 yuan, most traders did not change their minds. After the opening, selling pressure increased, and market prices gradually declined, falling by 0.1-0.2 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. However, at the opening in the afternoon, the market initially fluctuated, but due to the hot and muggy weather, people again speculated that heavy rain was coming, and suddenly short covering occurred, so the market strengthened again. However, the actual sales for this month were stagnant, so the outcome remained the same, as the reported price for Tianjin current flour by naval vessel was still 3.07 yuan. As a result, this month was down a small 0.25 li, July was up 0.25 li, August was unchanged, September was up 0.25 li, October was down a small 0.25 li, and November was down a small 0.25 li.</p>
<h3 id="e223">Wheat Futures in Flux <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday in the wheat futures market, after the opening in the morning and afternoon, the market for each month generally tended to fluctuate. Although foreign wheat prices had improved in the morning, prices for both near and far contracts fell by around 0.1-0.2 fen due to weak sentiment. In the afternoon, the market naturally followed the large decline and small rebound in the flour market, and stabilized slightly. However, the new wheat situation this year showed that about 90% had already been harvested in the Jiangnan region, and although there was still 20-30% remaining in Jiangbei, it would not hinder the future. Furthermore, the quality of the wheat was better than in previous years, so if the standard was raised too much, it would inevitably lead to an influx of current goods in the future. As a result, this month was unchanged, July was up by 0.1, August, September, and October were unchanged, and November was down by a small 0.1. The current wheat market was characterized by initial attempts at packaging, which were not yet smooth. Yesterday, 4 liang of Chuzhou wheat was opened, totaling over 200 bags.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the foreign long-grain rice market was unusually quiet. No one inquired about foreign rice, and there were no sellers. There were no transactions in either futures or spot markets. Although foreign long-grain rice holders were willing to sell, buyers had absolutely no interest. The only transaction was by this street for 170 bags of late Jiangxi machine rice at 11.1 yuan. There were no other transactions, and the market remained sluggish.</p>

<p>Yesterday, foreign firms in the local silk market continued to struggle. Overseas Japanese silk prices remained lower than Chinese silk prices. Telegram inquiries to Shanghai were few. Chinese merchants were passive, and transactions were difficult. Only Jardine Matheson and other firms brought in 30 bales of Shanghai white filature silk, and Taisoo and other firms brought in 25 bales of white dried filature silk. Prices remained firm.</p>

<p>The spring cocoon production in Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, and Zhenjiang was unusually poor, with less than 30% of the usual volume. Only about 30% of the cocoon shops opened compared to previous years, and the amount collected was generally not smooth. Currently, they are gradually closing down and processing the collected fresh cocoons for drying, and shipping them to Shanghai in batches by train. Temporary inspections and weighings are being conducted at the Maigen Road station of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway. Due to the poor harvest and small quantities of goods, only 500-600 bags are being transported to Shanghai each day, which is less than one-tenth of the previous year.</p>

<p>Wuyuan crated tea is usually exported via the waterway through Poyang and Jiujiang to Shanghai. Last year, due to banditry on the Yue-De line, the route was changed to land transport via Tunxi. Currently, the First Grade Precious Eyebrow teas from various firms are being crated and shipped in large quantities. However, due to concerns about unresolved banditry on the Gan River, which could lead to further losses, firms are cautiously deciding to continue using the old route via Tunxi. Although land transport increases costs, they are not concerned about this in order to ensure speed and avoid risks.</p>

<p>This year's spring tea harvest in the counties of Wuyuan, Xiuning, and She in Anhui Province was poor, with production only about half of last year. As a result, the amount of tea purchased by the tea firms in Tunxi, Wuyuan, and She was mostly less than expected. The bud tea harvest is now expected to make up for the shortfall. In various regions, the buds are now emerging, with a slightly purple color and a fragrant taste. If the weather is clear for ten days, with dew every morning, good development can be expected. Farmers are treating the bud tea as a rare commodity, preparing to harvest and process only a limited amount. The price when it is released is expected to be higher than regular tea.</p>

<p>Yesterday, in the local tea market for foreign firms, Jinlong, Tongfu, Xiehe, and Jardine Matheson were showing strong interest in shot-sized pearl tea from the Ping Shui Tu Zhuang area. The highest price for top-grade pearl tea reached 110 taels, and the market price was quite firm. For Zhenmei tea from the Lu Zhuang area, Chinese and foreign traders were still unable to reach an agreement due to the large difference in market prices. No special prices were offered throughout the city. However, Jardine Matheson and Xiehe made slight purchases of Needle Eyebrow tea, with high-grade tea selling for 73 taels and low-grade tea selling for 32-33 taels, with no increases or decreases from the previous day.</p>

<p>The woolen fabric market has been relatively calm recently, with no unusual price fluctuations. Only summer white drill and white straight-tribute fabrics saw slight changes yesterday. Demand was strong, and inventories were low, so selling prices gradually increased. Door-to-door shops and small traders were adding inventory daily, but full-box transactions were rare. Mitsui goods were very popular, and other Western goods from Levy, Hoste, and Italian firms were also running out of stock. Yesterday, Mitsui white straight-tribute fabric sold for 4 taels, 6 qian, 5 fen, and white drill sold for a net price of 4 taels.</p>

<p>The local cotton cloth market showed improvement again yesterday, with fine cloth making a leap forward. This was due to renewed activity from Tianjin traders and large-scale purchases from Sichuan traders, which caused a sudden surge in sentiment. Current goods were in short supply, and prices of all brands rose by around 1 qian. Blue Chicken reached 7 taels, 5 qian, 2 fen, 5 li in the afternoon. Blue Flying Fish was very scarce, selling for 7 taels, 9 qian, 7 fen, 5 li. Blue Double Fish sold for 7 taels, 7 qian, Yang Crane sold for 7 taels, 6 qian, 5 fen, and Hunter sold for 7 taels, 5 qian, 7 fen, 5 li. Blue Chicken was the most popular among all brands, with over 300 pieces purchased by Sichuan traders. Nine-pound cloth was the firmest among coarse cloths, reaching over 5 taels, 1 qian. Fine twill rose by 5 fen, and both Yih-Ho bleached cloth and plain cloth were firm.</p>
<p>In the Eastern piece goods market, Eastern goods were more active, and the demand from traders was unprecedented. In particular, Sichuan traders showed a sudden surge in demand, with over 50 pieces of hunting goose straight-tribute woolen fabric traded at 3 qian, 7 fen, 7 li, 5 hao. Purchases of fine drill were also significant, with Lake Pavilion at 3 qian, 4 fen, 5 li, and Jin Wengong at 3 qian, 3 fen, 5 li. Tianjin traders bought more Three Friends brand cloth, which sold for 3 qian, 3 fen, 5 li. Bleached cloth was added by many on this street, with Fu Hui at 12 taels, 4 qian, 5 fen, Ding Fu Jun San Shi at 11 taels, 9 qian, and Fu Shou San Xing at 11 taels, 1 qian. Striped Fu Silk and Striped Satin were consistently firm due to the gradual reduction in current goods.

The current price of Javanese sugar was 8 guilders, and the price of sugar futures for July and August was 8.125, unchanged from the previous day. Trading at the public association market remained quiet. Trading in Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar was slightly more active, opening at 11 taels, 4 qian, 7 fen, 5 li. Due to the lack of suppliers, it then rose to 11 taels, 5 qian. The market situation was particularly flat. No. 20 medium granulated white sugar was 10 taels, 08 qian, 5 fen, with very few buyers. Trading in Japanese sugar was also sporadic, with ER mark at 11 taels, 7 qian, YP mark at the same price, YT mark at 10 taels, 3 qian, and YRO mark at 10 taels, 09 qian, 5 fen.

<h3 id="e233">Dried Goods: Sichuan Pickled Mustard Greens Have Reached Bottom <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>Due to a bumper crop and abundant supply of Sichuan pickled mustard greens this year, supply exceeded demand, and market prices have gradually declined. Prices have now reached the bottom, with middle-grade mustard greens only selling for 21-22 yuan, a difference of more than ten yuan from the highest price. Therefore, some in the industry are planning to buy and stockpile them, which may cause the market to improve slightly.</p>
<h3 id="e234">Hardware: New Lead Wire Sales Active Among Yangtze Traders <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>New lead wire of sizes 8, 10, 12, 13, and 14 has recently seen a surge in trading. It is reported that the buyers are mostly from the Yangtze River region, with some scattered demand from Tianjin traders. Due to supply falling short of demand, prices have risen sharply, estimated at 10-12 taels. However, as remaining inventory dries up, prices are expected to gradually increase further.</p>
