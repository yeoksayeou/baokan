<p>時評</p>
<h3>謹貢獻於一中全會—整頓軍事</h3>
<p>今日而欲澄淸政治。而欲防遏内亂。而欲起我國家民族之痼疾。而欲拯我全國平民大衆於塗炭。必須嚴厲整頓軍隊。澈底改革軍制使軍人不能干涉政治。使軍隊成爲眞正之國家與人民之武力。使野心梟傑無所憑藉而得以魚肉人民。擾亂國家此蓋爲第一要着。亦即所以澄淸二十年來一團死水式之混亂政治之對症要藥。</p>
<p>我國家今日養兵二百餘萬。而所謂警察團防保安隊以及自招兵自買馬無所依附之雜牌軍隊。尙不在内也。國家年費國幣百分之八十以上以養兵。而各省各地軍隊之强徵軍費。以及人民所擔負之種種團防費保安費。尙不在内也。國家養如此其多之軍隊。人民擔負如此其重之軍費。然而其結果則恰以養成二十年來相繼而起之軍閥。造成循環不息之内戰。愈以致國家之鷹爛。民生之塗炭迄於今日。更情勢岌岌。不可終朝故我國今日之軍隊。不僅不足以衛國保民。而適足以禍國害民。國家固無貴乎有此軍隊。人民更何貴乎有此武力。</p>
<p>即以眼前之事實而言。各省各有其軍隊。各區各有其軍隊。各成系統。各立派别。派别之間。隱然敵對。各劃防地。戒備嚴密。國家軍費年有定額。而士兵餉糈。長期拖欠。就地籌欵。挨户抽丁。各自日益積極擴張其勢力。互相排擠。互相猜忌。排擠之極。即爆發而爲戰爭。前日袍澤。今日仇讐。互相醜詆。不留餘地。爲時無久。則又握手言歡。怡然道故。循環起伏。有如一轍。然而人民所蒙受之創傷與痛苦。則逐年增加。迴想北代期間。黨軍與人民打成一片。實際爲人民解除痛苦。拯人民於水深火熱之情况。眞令人興白髮宮女談開元盛事不堪回首之感惟其如此。故政治黨務皆爲軍人所操持。軍人勢力之所及。土地人民。則皆爲其所獨有。榨取與戰爭之結果。使民生愈困流亡愈多。人民求生無所。即以當兵爲唯一之出路。擁有實力之梟傑。乃月予數元。衣以灰　。命之爲兵。驅之爲個人作忠實之鷹犬。軍督僱傭。但知有個人。絶不知有國家。絶不知有人民。絶不知其本身所應負荷　衛國保民之天職。有如此之軍人。故勇於内爭而怯於禦外。吾人今不欲拯我國家民族之危亡則已。如其不然。則此種情勢絶不能再容其延長。今日必以斷然之手段。澈底整頓軍隊。改革軍制嚴厲制止軍人干涉政治。使武人政治。永無復活之機。</p>
<p>整頓之道爲何。曰統一編制。統一指揮。限制招幕。實行墾屯。確定餇糈。平均分配。　予敎訓。改良士兵之待遇。嚴禁長官之剥削。打破其系派之成見。分别調駐　　要塞。使其實際負荷衛國保民之天職必如此。然後可以杜絶軍人之干涉政治。然後可以杜絶内亂。我國家民族。然後得有甦生之機。</p>
<p>日本今日雄踞東亞虎瞰全球。國勢之盛。固已登峯造極。然彼國内政。跋扈專横。心腹之患。終必爆發於一旦。我國力旣遠不逮日本。而軍人之跋扈專横則尤過之。今日之危困。夫豈無因。兹後如再不翻然改圖。澈底改革。則極目茫茫。國家前途。眞黝黑如漆。永無新生之望矣。</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>玳梁憶語</h3>
<p>— 燕子</p>
<p>予弱冠後。頗喜徵逐。一日與友輩偶登酒家樓。隔室聞弦索聲而和以蚓唱跬鳴之曲。頗異之。叩之酒傭曰。日妓也。友固好事者。囑傭取日妓花名簿。檢閱之妓名之後。粘以妓照。高髻寬衫。毫無丰致之可取。酒傭從旁諛之曰。若善謳之名妓也。若善戰之名妓也。友漫應之飛箋召二日妓至。（多在中虹橋一带）年相若。满臉塗粉。幾如逼宮之阿瞒。余一見欲嘔友强使坐余側。雖言語不通。而殷勤倍至。余侷促竟如轅下駒。探囊取鷹翼三枚。擲與之。而促其返。妓離座鞠躬道謝而去。如釋重負。自此與友誓。永不許再罹此厄。蓋當夕之困苦。實有難言之隱痛也尋歡云何哉。</p>
<p>不除庭竹齊夫谈薈</p>
<h3>甘地先生敷衍法國人（下）</h3>
<p>在亞洲，一八八四年中法戰後，安南成爲法國保護國。廣州灣是在一八九八年向中國借去的。這些地方連交趾，老撾，柬埔寨，一起歸一個法國總督管轄。現在風傳法軍侵我西南，雖經法國公使否認，但從歷史的趨勢看來，要說法國没有擴大它的亞洲帝國的野心，便是獃子也不肯信。</p>
<p>一個標榜自由平等博愛的所謂共和國也做了帝國主義的高徒，究竟有什麽道理去辯護它的矛盾。法國人自已的辯護是¨</p>
<p>（擴大殖民地實負有文化上之使命，因劣種人不受敎訓是不配實行自由平等博愛的。）</p>
<p>在安南鄰近有一個自主國，呌做暹羅。一千人當中有六十個學生。而法國文化使命下之安南。一千人中只有學生七人。這文化的使命是負到那兒去了？</p>
<p>法國人旣受了甘地先生之恭維，以後眞能將自由平等博愛實踐出來，纔算是不辜負甘地先生之好意咧。</p>
<p>可是將英法殖民方法比較一下，印度可以產生甘地¨甘地若在安南是早已槍斃了。那末甘地恭維法國人的話，不但是摩洛哥人，阿拉伯人，黑柏柏人，安南人不服，就是英國人聽了也未必以爲公平咧。</p>
<p>弱小民族，各自爲謀，如何可以翻身？印度人必定要把眼光射到印度以外才能有些成功。中國人也必定要有這個認識，前途纔有光明。</p>
<h3>記嘉定黄允之</h3>
<p>— 淸癯</p>
<p>黄君允之。爲吾邑著聞於時之一人物。於上月二日病殁於上海之大華醫院。噩耗所傳。聞者哀之。十九日開追悼會於邑之公共演講廳到者幾及千人。而座爲之满。滬上黄任之。亦於是日下午乘汽車蒞嘉。參預是會其演說時。至泣不成聲。傳曰（一生一死乃見交情。）吾於此公亦云。蘇州張一麔且挽以詩。曰（陶庵不作西莊逝偪拶時艱出異才。大陸未沈君已去。满城桃李痛山頽）。（車中促膝幾何時。忽地牙琴感子期。八百彌羅彈指合。生天容見鐵輪馳。）蓋不特愴懷故友。而感傷國難。有鬱於中而不得不藉此一傾吐焉。</p>
<p>允之考文惠先生。耽於經史。其兄鄦臣。能傳家學。於邑政多所規畫。著有謀邑編。稱先進焉。而允之尤富於政聞。民初任省議員。目爲四兇之一。以每出席。常若骨　在喉。不吐不安之態。有以致之。婁東洪伯言知上海縣事任第一科長。倚之若左右手。嗣任新申報撰述。每日千言立就。購者爭閱之。未幾。與當局意不諧。即輟筆以去。金山陳陶遺民黨先輩。民十四有徵爲江蘇省長者。陳恐難於措理。久不决。顧欲得允之爲秘書。方報可。君諾而陳乃應命。故陳雖孱羸。憚於行動之老　。亦於日前來嘉親自一弔。亦可見其情誼之篤已。</p>
<p>尤可異者。黄氏三十年中。文惠卒後。繼以鄦臣。至今歲君之淹怱以逝。皆越十年。一若有定數者然。其家素畜狸奴以伺鼠。每遭故。輒生子五頭。幾於歷試不爽。</p>
<h3>所見所聞</h3>
<p>— 大維</p>
<p>看見一個中學生。問他現在國勢怎樣了。他說（現在開會·宣傳　·請願…忙不了。那有時間去看報。）</p>
<p>打電話到學校去找他們。他們都說忙着救國。在電影院門口碰着他們。都說在院中做宣傳工作。我默然了。</p>
<p>在國難聲中去看國產影片。這是提倡國貨。在舊劇院中說是發揚國粹。在游藝塲中又說是（娛樂不忘愛國。愛國不忘娛樂。）</p>
<p>此次夏間貓之所產復稱是。君之萱堂固健在。年已八十餘矣。見之蹙然曰。（何物之不祥屢也。）聞者不識所以。迨君病到滬。醫者束手。家人咸秘不以告。母夫人謂（潮兒恐終難治。不復能生回。余已早知之。爾等尙欲瞒我耶。）時實已病篤。彌留不久矣。噫、此豈所謂理之不可推。而事之不可解。竟有如是之奇哉。</p>
<h3>出征</h3>
<p>— 淸年援馬團一團員</p>
<p>六（離蘇州）</p>
<p>如雲如水的光陰。怱怱地過得很快。不知不覺我們别了上海已是六天了。在這六天之内。我們並不感到有些勞苦。祇恨未能即時殺向前方。把倭奴的鮮血當美酒酣飲一頓。</p>
<p>十三日下午。我們全體乘車到了無錫。不消說。歡迎的同胞不减在蘇州的盛况。當晚就在鐵路堆棧内留宿一宵。</p>
<p>次日晨。江蘇敎育學院。各中小學校。及各團體等約萬餘人。在公園開歡迎及歡送大會。蒙各界代表致詞訓勉。十分感激當時有靑年學生十二人要求加入。一片至誠。剌血宣誓。我們不忍拒絶。開會後。環市街游行一週。到車站候車前進。</p>
<p>無錫的工廠。在國内算是最多了。當火車尙未到車站時。遠遠地早就看見了一枝一枝筆直的烟囱矗立着。尤其令人欣喜的。便是各個烟囱都是放着綿綿的黑烟。我們從此點觀察。可以推測到無錫的商業發達的概况了。我因此而感到日帝國主義者在上海的烟囱。何嘗不是如無錫一樣。我們又可以想見我國的商業被倭寇侵略的成績了。現在日商爲了我們上下一心的經濟絶交以後。所有烟囱已漸漸没有烟放了。這個。我們雖然是很可快慰的。但是。還希望後方的同胞們。不要再僅有五分鐘的熱度才好呵。</p>
<h3>湔雪國恥的福音</h3>
<p>— 天虚我生</p>
<p>昨見某紙號有一種樣本云係專爲中國銀行預備將所用一切紙張。完全改用中國紙而設其樣本中之紙。均係中國紙夾裱而成。並拖礬水。以便鋼筆寫字用洋墨水不致滲化其實滲化之弊。不在於紙。而在於墨水。僕自患書痙以來。即用鋼筆寫字。所用墨水。從前亦係卡德墨水。自設利用造紙廠後。决心將洋墨水屏棄不用。自製一種墨水居然鋼筆毛筆可以兩用。（名爲栩製墨水）且較用洋墨水便宜之處有五。（一）但用海棉一小塊。浸於墨水缸中。即可任用鋼筆或毛筆寫字於任何中國紙上。均不滲化。但新筆尖在第一次用時。須用火柴燒熱。以後即永遠受墨且可免銹（二）洋墨水不易乾燥。故必自左而右横行斜寫。方可免於沾污。此則隨寫乾。不必用吸墨紙矣。（三）洋墨水可用藥水洗去墨跡。此則任何化學藥品不能洗去。故於簿記最宜。（四）洋墨水祇有藍黑而無濃黑如中國墨者。此則與臨時磨用之中國墨完全無二。若寫大件可省磨墨之煩。（五）外國紙帳簿。價值奇昻。因用鋼筆寫字。不致兩面滲轉故不得不用厚紙洋裝今則完全不生問題。任用何種中國紙均可。除上述外。尙有一種奇事即凡用日本木漿所造之東洋連史胃充爲中國紙者。若用此種墨水。以鋼筆寫之。依然滲化。故愚以爲此種天然的抗日利器。實足以打倒一切侵略武具。而使人人寫字檯上宣告光復。湔雪國恥。造成革命化之新紀元也至於支票用紙亦可改印利用夾連。藉以引起用户之愛國心。自兹以往。凡爲寫字用紙。即無需用外國紙之必要豈不差强人意。而信紙信封以及公文書與講義等。則更無論矣。故愚認爲福音。謹以報告讀者。（却酬）</p>
<h3>高君珊歐美歸來話國難（六）</h3>
<p>— 寄萍</p>
<p>從今以後。我國的政府如能及時覺悟。就應當注意國際宣傳的工作。永久的工作。奬勵駐外使領館的職員。用私人名義。主做國際宣傳。選拔留學生中能寫文章。能演說的人。专做這一項工作。這種事需要時間和精力。政府應當給以相當的報酬。國内的西文雜誌。如中國評論週報。民族週刋。密勒評論報等等。都是極好的國際定傳　工具。政府應當充分去利用。平日應令此類刋物多做宣傳的文字。并應給以充分的補助費。使能多多散寄於各國。以引起各國人士的注意。兩月前。中國評論週報社曾刋印田中奏摺全文。出版之後該社曾分寄各國。舍間亦購買若干份。郵寄各國報館。及政府機關。據十一月中旬。申報載東京路透電稱。日人因聞田中奏摺已到歐洲各國。大爲驚愕。并誣爲中國人所杜造云。又蘇俄。倫敦。紐約。路透電稱。該地報紙同日載此項奏摺。并很能引起社會的注意。倫敦晨報曾電問中國評論週報社。此項奏摺的來源。并且匯洋若干。以爲覆電的費用。可見得就是這一點的宣傳　工作。已經能夠引動各國的視聽了。我們因此更加努力。十餘天前曾　東京帝國大學敎授横田喜三朗的演說辭。（内言日本出兵東北是有背公理的）印成小册子數百份。除散寄各國報館。雜誌社。各機關。各要人外。并曾將數十份由我國代表轉交國聯要人。希望此項工作不久可以發生效力。總而言之。國事到了這個地步。我們也不用灰心。也不用痛哭流涕。祇要忍着奇恥大辱。再向有效的方面努力地去幹。能有一分的成績。就是一分的好處。照這樣或者有失之東隅。收之桑榆的希望吧。</p>

<h3>與子同仇（二十）</h3>
<p>— 顧明道</p>
<p>第五章沙塲喋血</p>
<p>戰夠多時。忠淑見自已部下死傷漸多。陣地也被騎兵衝破。急令退走。於是漸漸退却。太陽軍大喜。他們也以爲中國軍隊本不夠打的。更加輕視。自　狠命的一齊追撃。不料追至野鷄岡前。對面突然隆隆的連開三砲。正撃中太陽軍的騎兵隊。炸死不少人馬。金龜十三郎知道敵人有了接應。也吩咐砲兵開砲還撃。一時黑烟障天。砲撃震地。忠淑的兵也同時返攻。都用手溜彈衝鋒。結連附近槍聲一處處的響起。金龜十三郎知道中計。不知敵人有多少埋伏。祗得吩咐退軍。忠淑指揮部下一步步的逼上去。太阳軍退至半途。正要擇地而守。不防侧面華乃强率領騎兵殺來。人强隊壯。無不以一當十。太陽軍措手不及。紛紛潰退。華乃强騎着一匹高大的白馬。一手握手槍。一手揮寳劍。當先衝鋒。勇不顧生。激動了部下的勇氣。一齊努力殺賊。太陽軍一向是輕敵的。不想今天遇到了勁敵。大敗而回。華乃强收集部下。死亡一百餘人。受傷者數十人。奪獲鐵甲車一輛。重砲兩尊。步槍數百枝。敵人殲滅甚衆。屍横盈野。此役得獲全勝。足寒賊人之膽。華乃强與忠涉喜不自勝。遂商量乘勝克復T城。下令全軍迅即開拔。金龜十三郎敗入T城。探知中國軍隊追踪而至。忙吩咐部下堅守城垣。四周佈置電網。架設大砲。悉力禦敵。一邊飛電至S城請援。華乃强攻打了一日夜。都因太陽軍砲火猛烈。不能近城。但是城中人民巴不得太陽軍失敗。漸有躍躍欲試之意了。可惡的太陽軍大隊援兵已於次晨開到三千餘名。且有鐵甲車三列。飛機七八架。分兩路向華乃强軍包圍。飛機在空中助戰。時時投下重磅炸彈。眞是彈雨硝烟。馬横人倒。兩軍血戰一日。到得晚上。華乃强見部下傷亡甚多。防地已被衝破。再不退走。將被敵軍包圍。不能得脫。没奈何長嘆一聲。傳令部下總退却。此時金龜十三郎也已率騎兵衝殺出城。見華乃强軍隊復退。深恐再中詭計。便止住太陽軍不要窮追。因此華乃强一軍能夠安穩而退。退至野鷄崗。見敵人並不追殺。即令暫駐。檢點部下死傷甚多。總計不足三千人了。忠淑對華乃强說道。我瞧太陽軍已有增援。T城一時難於克復。我等不如據險而守。再圖反攻。</p>

<h3>紗市趨勢頽唐</h3>
<p>紗市甚疲、趨勢異常衰弱、蓋以國事日趨嚴重、錦州戰事空氣緊張致人心虚軟而銀根難鬆、故多數心理、一致看跌、然底貨未見濃厚多頭拉緊不放市勢由此遂成殭局、實銷蜀帮採辦仍不間斷云、</p>

<h3>棉市庸碌</h3>
<p>棉市稍軟、形勢十分暗淡、因瑕境不良、金融奇緊、實需岑寂各廠外棉均已吸飽本棉全、無辦胃、故　况甚弱、但一般業外者及漢寗帮、以其底盤太　且金價難小因此拉緊不放、所以市氣亦成不上不落之狀、</p>

<h3>糧食河斛益形呆滞</h3>
<p>兩頭　昨日來原尙湧、浦江中船貨存積約有七八十號、本衝胃口因天時晴正、臨市者極缺、河下斛脚不满千石、蘇同北場來貨不斷、形勢各低一角、　稻市小角外、洋杜尖無所榮辱、變陰元　　店黄進六百石虹　照原盤、</p>
<p>新閘　昨到不多、河下斛脚不見起色、早間各店號交易微細、厚新粳行情低落角許、早薄二稻來貨尙多、價小二角洋杜尖本城方面買進不多、惟外埠　越二帮均有採辦故價趨緊、</p>
<h3>北洋帮續辦小絞米</h3>
<p>蘇更地新有成交</p>
<p>昨日洋米市况、仍居穩站之局、因漢口帮昨市停手後、有北洋帮問津、本街胃口仍活、市面依然站勢、北帮續辦小絞五百包此批去後如能合划、則再有繼續成交、統市開出小絞米一千包、價九元四角至九元二角七分、一號西貢五百包、價十一元二角半至十一元、北帮除洋米外、又去贛元二百多包、價十三元七角至十三元四角半、本街又去台州米五百包、價十元至九元四角期貨回　不多新交易有二月份小絞一千噸、價與前市相同、又祥茂售出仰光長尖米（即蘇粳地）二月份一千噸價四兩八錢半、此米久無到埠、新始成交云、</p>
<h3>麥市近堅遠軟</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面大致呈盤旋之象、近期月份以買户尙堅、市氣微佳、遠期月份、以洋麥之報落、并因廠方之定貨、終不絶跡、故市值雖低、人心未能带緊、不過收束已近、當可暫時平靜也結果一二月份較前日好一分、三月份小一分、四月份小二分、五月份小一分云、</p>
<p>本月份之小麥交　聞　　約四千餘車、預備收貨者、聞志誠永將將三十餘車、仁誠收八車云</p>
<h3>標粉復趨疲勢</h3>
<p>昨日粉市大致呈平疲之象、以洋麥報價回小二三角左右、兼以陽歷年終結束不遠一部份内地帮、均有回出、北路實銷帮、半因封河關係、半因日軍之横行、實際辦貨自均减少、故近遠期復趨疲軟、惟大廠籌碼、均已了結舒齊、祇中小廠尙有套貨、故此後市面、或無大出人也、結果本月份較前日跌一分二厘半、一月份跌一分半、二月份跌五厘、三月份跌一分二厘半、四月份跌一分、五月份跌一分半云、</p>
<p>南北貨</p>
<h3>南芡市價高昂逾恒</h3>
<p>南塘芡實今庚因出產稀少、　來到存均缺、市價愈漲愈高、昨市高貨竟達一百九十元、次一百八十五元、如至來春或將到二百餘元亦未可知池芡近亦見升、現售三十七八兩、勢甚穩固、後市不致轉鬆云、</p>
<h3>絲茶歐美絲銷每况愈下</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊絲市、每况愈下、查歐美市場、華絲價均慘跌、無人問訊、絲電毫無轉滬、絲市前途、益陷絶境、昨祗高倍等進白乾經五包、克昌進黄粗絲三包價仍平疲云、</p>
<h3>里昂白廠經猛跌</h3>
<p>每基羅各跌一二十法郎</p>
<p>里昂生絲市場、近受日絲廉價侵銷影響、加以經濟益呈恐慌、華絲無人問訊、絲價猛跌尤以滬白廠經爲最、計A字級线基羅祇開一百三十五法郎B字級一百二十法郎、C字級一百○八法郎、較上週初各跌一二十法郎云、</p>
<h3>五金紫銅開出三百餘擔</h3>
<p>紫銅交易、久告岑寂、故市場中亦多日未見報告、惟昨日南京方面、忽來電委辦三百五十餘担、其開出價每担爲三十八兩、比前似覺小夫五錢、惟調查存貨仍屬充塞、所以行情一節、頗有續軟之象云、</p>
<h3>黑鐵皮蠕蠕欲動</h3>
<p>黑鐵皮自上次津帮狂辦後、市面曾一度發展、其後因購者岑寂、市告冷落、近數日來交易方面、亦有蠕蠕欲動之象、其購辦者則爲靑津河南諸帮、惟本衝買買、仍不見有回好氣象云、</p>

<h3>江鵾飛機失事後</h3>
<p>兩駕駛員死得可惜</p>
<p>陳紹寬等親往致祭</p>
<p>海軍航空處之江鵾號飛機、於前晨由該處之駕駛員李利峰·陳啓華·駕駛不愼、而致失事、兩人均受重傷、送至寳隆醫院治療、無效身死、新聲社記者昨晤該處處長曾貽經、據談此次失事情形頗詳、兩死者尸體、已舁入萬國殯儀館、於昨日午後六時半、由海軍次長陳紹寬、率海空航空全體人士赴館、主持主祭禮、聞海部亦擬給以撫恤、兩尸則由軍艦運往原籍　州、公司中所受損失達一萬餘元、兹將詳情分誌如下、</p>
<p>失事眞相死難之李利峰氏、於本年五月間、畢業於航空學校、學識技術均佳、爲航空處學生中之最佳者、是日失事、實有一大原因、緣前兩日有英美二飛行家、假該處試演航空技術、五花八門、而於飛至百五十尺以上、即行小轉灣、李見之、即憤謂彼西人能如此、吾豈不能、於是即於兹日試演種種花樣、且於二百五十尺以上、即行小轉灣、（按該處駕駛員試演普通均至四百尺以上、始行小轉灣、否則萬一發生不測、不易補救、因飛愈低、而墜地愈速也、）再將機倒轉、致失重心而下墮、陳啓華僅存一息、旋即斃命、李則尙能發言、惟腦壳略受傷、舌頭亦跌斷、迄至入殮、其舌尙未檢得、</p>
<p>損失統計據曾處長語新聲社記者、此次損失尙微、一呆練習機、僅值一萬餘金、不及二萬、所可惜者、即二人之慘死、因李陳兩人、均爲該處人員中技術最精者、向例航空學校畢業、祗有四十餘個鐘點之飛行經騐、但兩死者平時、常在試飛、故已有一百六七十鐘點之飛行經騐、上下計有二千餘次、李之術尤較陳爲精、故殊爲可惜云、</p>
<p>舉行公祭兩死者于寳隆醫院斃命後、即送至萬國殯儀館、昨日午後六時半、由海次陳紹寬親赴致祭、到者有海軍飛機處處長曾貽經、海岸巡防處處長吳振南、中國航空公司代表王助、歐亞航空公司代表吳國章、中央航空第四隊隊長崔滄石、海軍第一艦隊司令陳季良、海軍部測量局局長吳光宗、航空工廠代表温陳兩副官、及全體海軍航空人員、　　給予撫恤李陳兩人、因公而死、海部照章程、將給撫恤、予其家屬、惟數目尙未確定、陳啓華死後、由其弟陳啓彬到塲、李氏則無親屬、至兩死者均隷籍福州、刻海軍部已令如有軍艦至福州、將兩死者之靈柩带回云、</p>

<p>汽車新聞</p>
<p>專論</p>
<h3>汽車與人生</h3>
<p>乃日用品非奢侈品</p>
<p>近世汽車事業。突飛猛進。大有一日千里之勢。在歐美物質文明發揚之邦。幾於家置一輛。早視爲日常不可或缺之必需品。實際上言之。汽車有關人羣生活。增進世人福利。其爲日用要品。自無待言。不過歐美諸邦。經浪裕如。國富民阜人民享用汽車。本視爲普通之事。若在吾國則其情形自又不同也。吾國經濟衰落。處處在人之後。生活程度亦較歐美爲低。故人民亨用汽車遠不如彼。且一般人心目中之視汽車。其觀念亦因之而異。譬如以一上海一區而言。市中道路交互。車水馬龍。目不暇接。汽車一物。要已司空見慣。然試執途人而叩之曰。汽車爲日用必需品耶。抑爲奢侈品耶。余敢斷其答語屬於前者之三十。而後者乃佔十之七也。夫以上海事事爲風氣之先者。尙且如此。若在窮鄉僻境。民智閉塞之地。其視汽車爲何物哉。甚者且以神秘之怪物視之。嘗見某英人所著筆記。稱其在西藏時。竟見有士人向汽車膜拜。而目爲神物者。此雖一個絶對之引證。不能謂爲一般人皆如此。但亦不能謂爲絶無引證之價值也。職是之故。欲在中國而談汽車。其根本立塲。當然與歐美有異耳。試再申述其理由數點如次。歐美汽車事業之猛進。其第一點。爲工業發逹。利用機械人力。開發各種原料。一旦造成汽車。產量旣多。價亦經濟。於是流行廣泛。均屬意中之事。第二點。爲國家經濟充裕。人民財富普及。故汽車產生後。需要甚殷。產銷兩旺。一轉瞬間。普遍於全國。咸視爲日用之必需品。第三點。爲道路建築良佳。四通八逹。到處通行。郊外旅行還近代步。均可利用汽車。有此三種原因。與歐美之汽車事業。日新月盛。日益發逹。其視吾國情形。相去之遠。誠不可以道里計也。吾國生產落後。交通阻塞。雖有造車原料。無從開發。無從利用。於是汽車一項不得不遠求異邦。梯山航海。路途迢遙。一車之作。以較出產地。相去不啻倍蓰矣。此乃就汽車之來源而言。若其他附带關係。亦有可進一言者。前段所述不過論其來源差異。若就購買及使用上言。以視歐美生癧超前諸國。又有極大出入。試分兩點言之。一爲汽車之購買。國人於物質文明之享用尙未臻於頂點。在日常生活中使用機械物件。爲數殊不多　。此種原因。前已述之。即工業不發達。及經濟衰落是也。因之汽車之購買。初不過限於富有之人。若中人之家。則無置備此種代步用具之可能。夫物以稀爲貴。汽車之購買旣如是其不易。又無怪一般人之視爲奢侈品哉。苟與汽車出產最多之美國相比較。其相去誠有天懸之别。數年前。美國盛行一種口號。意爲（每一家庭須購置汽車一輛。）然時至今圖示福特運貨車拖曳巨木之情形。此木經七十四英寸。可鋸成長三千六百英尺之木板。總重量計十一噸。</p>
<p>日。情勢變遷。汽車事業尤爲猛進。於是此項口號。亦竟一變而爲（每人一輛汽車。）以彼例吾。相差如何。姑以全國最繁盛之上海而言。亦覺膛乎其後。據全市最近統計。上海汽車總數尙不到七千輛。以號稱百萬人口作比率。一百個家庭亦不能置車一輛也。第二、爲汽車之使用。汽車爲交通利器。人盡知之。然欲求汽車之實現其功用、必先自有寛暢平坦之道路起。試問今日國内各處築路情形如何。是否每一道路可以通行汽車。即退一步而言。有可駛汽車之道路。而汽車究將何求。因之雖有致遠任重之絶好代步品。亦無從發揮其最大之本能也。不過汽車之在今日。自有其卓越之地位。造福人羣。功用極大。實不能列於奢侈品之中。兹特將美國汽車雜誌編輯主任垔生勃君。關於汽車之演說詞。錄之如次。亦可以確估汽車之價值矣。（汽車製造業近載力謀改變各方視汽車爲奢侈品應科稅捐以爲限制之觀念。蓋汽車初興之時。價格昻貴。僅爲富者之御用。然自產量大增。價格步跌。而汽車之用途亦漸廣。不特私人代步。且爲公衆運輸所必需。</p>
<p>各國視汽車爲奢侈品科以相當稅捐尙數見不鮮。不知近世國家欲謀經濟之發展。以與他邦競勝。非藉汽車運輸·及良好道路不可。</p>
<p>今日汽車運輸百分之九十屬於商務性及必需性。僅百分之十近乎奢侈。兹再申述之。以爲我政商各界告。汽車之被爲奢侈品。或由於兜風二字。然兜風之意義頗難確定例。如星期日率家人兜風郊外。雖不能定全目爲奢侈。然猶近似之。倘以娛樂或社交爲目的者。可目爲奢侈。故汽車之屬於奢侈性者有二端。即兜風·娛樂·社交·反觀汽車之充商業上必需之用。則包括運貨汽車·長途汽車·出租汽車·販賣貨車公司車·私人用汽車·農民用汽車·醫士用汽車·電氣電話等公共事業所用汽車·政府官用汽車·郵件汽車·救火·救生等汽車·等等皆是。試以先後兩項比較。可知汽車運輸之屬於必需性者實佔百分之九十以上。而屬於奢侈者僅屬少數。</p>
<p>是項情形各國皆有。不特美國如此而已。汽車事業之發達方興未艾。不受世界產業壓迫及任何阻力所限止。蓋汽車事業方於近數年間適應交通上之需要。漸次推行。且使交通上之需要亦繼長增高。前程方長。未可限量。</p>
<p>汽車業某領袖嘗言。倘非每人能駛用並備置一汽車。歷久不壞。則汽車業之進步必無止境也。</p>
<p>譯聞</p>
<h3>汽車瀛聞　沛</h3>
<p>克雷斯勒造車增多　據克雷斯勒車廠副經理兼司庫赫金生氏稱。本年第三季九月份之克雷斯勒汽車。製造及銷售方面均較去年即一九三零年同時爲增多。據其報告上言。今年九月共產車二三，七五九輛　去年同時則爲一五，七二零輛。互相比較之下。足徵已增加百分之五十一也。本年第三季中運於各銷售商之克雷斯勒計共一○三，二二七。輛一九三零年同時則爲五五，六六五輛。計共增多百分之八十五。若以九個月相加計算。則今年九個月之時期中共產車二四二，九五三輛。去年則爲二三八，○六三輛。計共增加百分之二云。</p>
<p>蘇俄造車成績可觀　蘇俄專製拖曳汽車之司塔林勒工廠。邇來出品日多成績良佳。殊爲克拉謨林地方人士所自慶。此廠創立於一九三零年夏季。當時說者謂爲時機過早恐無良好結果。因之蘇俄政府對於此項工作。亦不過視爲一種之試騐性質耳。蓋常時廠中旣無專門學識之領袖。熟練之工人又極稀少。欲以經營新廠。而令其有良佳之出品。誠爲不易之　　　然而事至今日。大謬不然。蘇俄領宙人物感覺此廠之經營。已屆成功之途。而出品亦都切於實用。今年九月廠中共造拖曳汽車二千一百五十一輛。以工</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>作平日匀　　平時　　　造車八十二輛。然此數不過就平均計算之日而言若例外之時。則出品更多。　可每日造車一百輛之多。此廠革創之始。種種設備咸頗簡陋。不僅人才缺少已也。故自成立後之數個月中。逐日出產爲數頗少。其第一個月。每日不過出車二十輛之譜。且因製造欠良。質地不佳。使用時毫不耐久。往往用之數日便成廢物。因之說者謂司搭林勒廠之出品。可證明蘇俄尙無力創設一頭等之汽車製造廠也。然廠中職工不因出品不佳而灰心。續繼努力。猛進不已。其後出品即日就進步。數量方面亦日見增多。至去年七月其出品已由每日二十輛之數。一躍而達每日五十輛。及至九月又增至八十二輛。因之今年十月之日出一百輛拖曳汽車之預計。定可成爲事實也。</p>
<p>討論</p>
<p>外灘散亂草地</p>
<h3>可改爲停車塲　　阿平</h3>
<p>銅人碼頭之後。江海關署之前。有一長方之空地焉。地處黄浦灘濱。昔日整鋪潔草。現已散亂污穢四周繞以鐵環。其中不堪言狀。常見二三小宵。玩遊追逐·尋嬉作樂。凡此皆公衆之損失也。君其憶之。試再環顧外灘左右。汽車停駐者甚多。而來往該區。找尋地位者。更見絡繹不絶。上海現有汽車計一萬二千輛。外灘乃是必由之路。幾皆集中於是。加之最新頒布之停車規例。甚難使在外灘附近各路將車暫等。是以外灘遂爲上海中心區域唯一之停汽車塲焉。惜哉該處空地已佔殆盡。</p>
<p>中心區域之地價固貴。而其主因則在外灘地位適中。遠處仕女來集。商賈日臨。服務於斯。午則齊蒞附近就餐。此後又有市貨購物者。接踵而至。入晚才見仕女駛車返家。而離外灘。</p>
<p>上海車務管理職員。對於停車問題。實無辦法。蓋中區實無方寸土地。足以容納如許有增無减之車輛也。</p>
<p>公共租界工部局。爲何不將該散亂草地四周之鐵環拆去。而作停車塲乎。約計如是增出空地。有一千米突之多。換言之。上海汽車十二分之一。乃得解决在外有所矣。</p>
<p>倫敦之公共汽車</p>
<p>外灘共有草地四塊。其較近公園之二地。稍爲整潔。果可作爲上海水濱之點綴。然則其他二地。確盡被小販與乞兒所盤踞。是故旣不能使外灘。稍增美觀。又不見得與有利佐。</p>
<p>關於討論車務問題之文雖多。然尙以此篇有具體竟獻爲最有價值也。（上文係譯自大陸報職員西人魯易氏對工部局所呈之意）</p>
<p>我對於上海租界</p>
<h3>公共汽車一商榷　蕭國祥</h3>
<p>歸國後。勾留上海數次之多。每次出門。必藉諸公共汽車之力。故對於公共汽車。已有相當的認識。在我抵滬的第二日。因不熟習上海交通。買一幀新上海圖以便行旅。那知那圖並未詳細說明汽車路綫。故有等於無。後詢問友人各路汽車之情形。始得略知一二。一日。余在北四川路欲搭公共汽車往靜安寺。友人告余須乘第一號汽車。於是在汽車站守候片刻。即看見一輛公共汽車疾馳而來。余曾記憶此處有數號汽車經過。非先看淸楚不可。故多遠即注視那車頭處之號碼。或目的地牌子。那知所看見的牌子。旣不是路綫號碼。又非所達之目的地點牌子。確是一塊梅蘭芳牌香烟透亮廣告。當時怕乘錯了。不敢上去。故等第二部。數分鐘後。果來一輛。也是在車上掛一透明透亮的一塊矮克發照相材料字樣的廣告。徘徊數次。仍不敢冒昧上去。直等那第三輛來。屆時無法。只好詢問待車乘客號碼之所在。當蒙那位指點那暗而不明一個號碼。印在車頭之下部右角上。這次總算哥侖布發現大陸。喜出望外。看來果是１號。就放心扒上。交了車費。安然到了目的地。回憶此次假若在車頭上廣告處。放上一個１字或靜安寺字樣。那裏要躊躇許久呢。我希望公共汽車當局特加注意。急於改良。務使乘客易於辨識各車路綫。而感受許多便利。切不可以廣千之一筆收入。而誤原來之宗旨。除將每路號碼　　　明於車頭上外。可使外鄉及不熟識路綫乘客。不感困難。此乃余對於租界公共汽車一個商榷。尙希當局明察。今特將倫敦公共汽車標號登出。以便參考。</p>
<p>消息</p>
<h3>湖南全省公路局近况</h3>
<p>學遷</p>
<p>湖南省之有公路局。自民國二年始。嗣經華洋義賑會曁湖南第一第二第三各汽車路局。先後修築通車營業。至民國十八年。政府鑒於路政須有整個計劃。乃於是年九月。經黨政聯席會議。議决收歸省辦。成立湖南全省公路局籌備委員會。派員分途接收。十一月成立湖南全省公路局。迄於本年度止。將關於該局一切經過情形。約有四點。分述如次。</p>
<p>公路計劃　自成立全省公路局後。原定築路計劃。分七大幹線。十三支線。幹綫爲湘粤·湘桂·湘黔·湘川·湘贛及湘鄂東西各綫。共長四千八百二十里。分四期完成。支線爲沅衡·常洪·常芷·洪武·武零·零汝·茶祁·桂零·瀏汝·陰壽·常臨·寗湘·澧石·各線。共長八千六百六十九里。亦分四期完成。惟工程進行。純視經費爲轉移。兹公路局就目前財政情形。擬定本年度進行計劃如下。（一）本年度擬完成之路。爲湘粤線之郴宜段。湘鄂東線之黄高段。湘桂線之衡洪段·瀏汝支線之攸茶段。湘黔線之桃高段。（二）本年度擬興修之路。爲湘桂線之洪永段。湘川線之鄉橋段·湘鄂東線之高平段。（三）組織探測隊二組。分别探測桃洪桃沅兩段保路。（四）設立洪武·桃沅兩叚保管處。（五）完成通車各路站屋道棚橋梁設備等等。</p>
<p>修築經費　此項經費之籌措。預計爲統稅附加。年約一百二十萬元。鹽稅附加。年約十二萬元。營業盈餘。年約五十餘萬元。省庫撥助銀。年約一百五十萬至三百萬元。不料軍興以來。省庫支　不能充分發給。而營業收入。及各項附加。亦以戰禍影響。不能達預定之數。故築路經費。日呈艱窘。及長沙再陷。公私財政。悉行破產。裁釐以後。統稅附加。又無著落。路欵問題。至此遂更無從籌措。計自公路局成立日起。截至本年度四月底止。收入兩批。尙差十萬元有奇。</p>
<p>已成路線　查湘省路線之已成者。計有七線。（一）湘粤線之長衡段。由長沙起經湘潭衡山迄衡陽止。長三百一十七里。又衡郴段由衡陽起經來陽永興迄郴縣止。長二百四十七里。（二）湘黔畿之潭寳段。由湘潭起經湘鄉永豐迄邵陽之桃花坪止。長四百七十八里。（三）湘鄂西綫之長常段。由長河經寗鄉益陽迄常德止。長三百零四里。（四）湘桂綫之衡泉段。起衡陽迄泉湖。長六十一里。（五）瀏汝支線之醴攸段。起醴陵迄攸縣。長一百三十九里。（六）常洪支線之常挑段。起常德迄桃源。長六十一里。（七）湘贛綫之長水段。起長沙迄永安市。長五十四里。又湘鄂東綫之黄高段。業已完成。由黄花市至瞿家　之一十一里。共計已成之路長千六百八十餘里。其他郴宜·泉洪·攸茶·瞿高各段工程。均已完成十之七八。如路欵有着。均可於最近期内完成通車。</p>
<p>營業狀况　查湘省公路局成立之初。即值數十年來未有之冰雪。不能行車。歷時兩月有餘。四月以後。討逆軍興。各路車輛。疲干軍運敢入因之銳减。及桂軍入湘。軍輛益多損壞。營業方面。影響尤鉅。桂軍旣去。赤匪又來。全省行政。陷於停頓者前後將近一月。赤氛偏野。行旅戒途。營業收入。自無可言。本年五月以來大水爲災。各路路線。多被淹没。而尤以長常常桃兩叚。淹没較久。路基車輛。損壞特甚。營業愈受打撃。計自公路局成立日期起。截至本年七月止。各叚每月平均收入。計潭寳叚六萬五千餘元。長衡叚二萬五千七百餘元。衡郴叚一萬三千八百餘元。醴攸叚七千六百餘元。長常叚一萬五千二百餘元。常桃叚五千三百餘元。長永高叚七千六百餘元。全部合計每月平均總收入約十四萬餘元。此因年來天災人禍之影響。有數處幾無收入之故。嗣後時局日趨穩定社會經濟力。逐漸恢复。加以公路局對於營業方面。銳意整理。即以現在論每月總收入。旺月可達十九萬元以上。淡月亦十三萬餘元。將來當更有起色也。</p>

<p>上海銀行調查部編</p>
<p>普通銀行的最大使命、在乎辅助及發展工商業、要輔助及發展工商業、先要了解工商業、能了解工商業能輔助其進展、能改善其經營才能不辜負社會上一般存欵人士之信託、才能算一個眞正的銀行、我國近十年來、銀行事業發展很快、就理論上言、工商業似乎也要一天天的興盛起來了、可是十年來工商事業的凋疲、却是有目共見的事實、大多數的銀行、乃不過做了一個公債買賣的機關、對於工商業、簡直不發生什麽大的關系、更不發生十分合理的關係、放起欵來、也和錢莊一樣、看看東家財產、聽聽經理吹嘘、而定期數額、對於其所經營之商品或事業、是否合理、是否可靠、反置之不求甚解之列、工商事業的性質、旣不願十分了解、那麽圑助工商事業的程度、也當然是很有限的、年來銀行發展、而工商事業之不發展的畸形狀態、也由此而成、</p>
<p>上海銀行、本其服務社會及輔助工商業之宗旨、於本年發行商品叢刋、已出有米·棉·紗三種、這種工作、能由一普通銀行去進行、實值得吾人非常的欽偑）因爲這一種叢刋的編印、並不是一定賺錢的勾當、該行不眩於近視的賺錢問題、竟能發行此種叢刋、姑不論其工作的價值如何、但就其工作本身而言、巳具見該行欲澈底了解工商業的决心、與積極輔助工商業的準備、倘使此種精神、在銀行界中、能蔚爲一種風氣、多能注意於工商業的推進、而不在公債賣買上討生活、那麽吾國工商業、必能大大進展、不特抵制日貨、可完全發生效力、國民經濟全體、或許也要改進不少、該行出版此種叢刋、旣有相當意義、並且叢刋的内容、亦要言不煩、叙述簡明材料豐富而有序、實有一讀的價值、因予以介紹如下、</p>
<h3>一、米、</h3>
<p>商品叢刋第一册是米、吾人天天吃米、可是米有幾種、或許只有吃米行或米店的人才能回答得出、因此本篇第一節就講上海米之種類、並附以各種米的化學上成分、俾吾人知道天天吃米、究應吃那佳米最佳、第二節述上海米之供需、對於上海糧食委員會的估計、有所更正、據該書估計、上海每年需米約爲五百六十萬石、供給亦如之、在米糧供給中、洋米到數最巨、可是本埠所需要的、都並非洋米、而是粳米、其中有一段（米的悲劇）、兹錄之如下、</p>
<p>（洋米到貨雖多、大部份轉運其他地方、本埠生活程度較高、對於品質較次於粳秈之洋米、除貧民外、不甚光顧、光顧者多爲粳米、於其銷數中、可以見之、而種植粳米之内地農民、因粳米價貴、洋米價賤之故、反糶出粳米、吃進洋米、以博微利、）</p>
<p>第三節論米的運輸、詳述自内地或自外國運輸米糧至上海的費用、及在外省或外國定米的手續、第四節述上海米之交易、——即米業、把米業分爲下列數種、（一）米客或米販、（二）經售米糧業、（三）米行、（四）米店及（五）碾米廠分别與以解說、對於外省米及外洋米的交易及上海碾米廠之經營、亦有詳盡的叙述、第五節述上海米業之金融、分業中金融運輸金融、及米業金融季節三項討論、於其利益來源、所負風險等等、叙述頗詳、第六節述上海米業之會計、第七節述上海之米價、先述其長期趨勢、次述其季節變化、再述其漲落之原因、最後一段述上海米價漲落之動力、頗有精彩、節錄如下、</p>
<p>（…米之種類旣多、其漲落之發動、以何種爲標準乎、就一般觀察言、爲特别粳、逢特别粳漲價、則各種米糧均隨之而漲、但考之實際、特别粳不過佔粳米中之二成、爲數不多、今以少數米統率多數米、一若爲多數米之代表、揆之事理、豈得謂平年來上海米糧之奇漲、特别粳爲之厲階、蓋特别粳之消費者爲富貴階級、米價儘可向上升漲、並不斤斤於此、然而其他米乃隨之而升、一般小民、乃大受其害、故晚近頗有人禁止特别粳之輸入、以爲衡平米價之方法者、）</p>
<p>第八節述上海米業之團體、第九節即最後一節、述上海米業改善之方針、分爲三點說、（一）自商品本身言、滬上米糧種類過多、且最貴之米、並非營養最佳者、最貴的米、是常特别粳、實際上營養滋料、反不如糙米、且碾白時一石僅得七斗五六升、浪費甚多、因此政府對於米糧應分定等級、並規定米廠碾白標準、（二）自賣買習慣言、米業中分業過多、且交易上不無流弊、如粳米混以秈米、攙水、輕斛與衝斛、暗盤貼價、昻佣等、改善方法、一方面應由官廳監督、一方面亦應由同業互相規勵、力求革新之道、此外缺乏新式米倉或米棧、也是米業中的缺憾、應亟事創設、（三）自金融方面言、應推廣押匯及押欵辦法、便利米業資金的因轉、對於米的供</p>

<p>需、自能助其平衡、</p>
<p>正文以外、又輔以附錄多種、如上海米店、米行、經售米糧業、售出洋米行家覧、及六十年來上海米價指數表、上海粳米價格表、米產地斛與上海斛比較表、六十二年洋米輸入表、全國產米重要區域表等、都是良好的參考資料、</p>
<p>（二）棉</p>
<p>本篇的組織、與上篇相同、即分爲上列數節、（一）上海棉花之種類、（二）上海棉花之供需、（三）上海棉花之運輸、（四）上海棉花之交易—棉業、（五）上海棉業之金融、（六）上海之棉價、（七）上海之棉業團體、及（八）上海棉業改善之方針、</p>
<p>在（上海棉花之供需）中、有一段很能引人注意、估計滬上棉花的需要凡四百九十餘萬擔、供給凡五百三十餘萬擔、可是在這巨大需供裏面、論上海棉花之需要、華商紗廠反不如日商紗廠之大、而論上海棉花之供給、華棉反不如外棉之多、前者爲喧賓奪主之象徵、而後者爲農業破產之表示、隱患如是、大堪杞憂、）以農立國的中華、竟亦具這種現象、可見工商業固然落伍、農業也不見得高明、我國棉業之亟待提倡、於此可見、</p>
<p>本篇論上海棉花之輸甚詳、關於運輸棉花的預備、（即打包）運輸的路程各費用、輸出入的報關堆棧手續、以及輸出入的數量、均逐條叙述、可做從事於棉業者的參考、關於棉業中之交易手續、及棉業之金融、亦予以詳盡的分析、最後節、論上海棉業改善之方針、爲本篇最有精彩之處、先論上海棉業的缺陷、分三方面說（一）自棉花本身言、其缺點爲（甲）產量太少、供給不足、（乙）品質退化、（丙）品質不齊、（丁）包裝不一、及（戊）缺乏統計、（二）自棉業本身言、其缺點爲（甲）流弊叢生、如撬水、混入棉子或籽棉、混入低級棉、混入飛花廢花及混入泥砂等、（乙）運輸不便、（丙）外人辦棉、品質良者國人反不能染指、（丁）外人包辦棉花進出口贸易、及（戊）中間商人過多、（三）自棉業之金融言、其缺點爲（甲）缺　資本、及（乙）對於新式之信用方法、尙未能充分利用、改善方法、亦分三點言、（一）政府方面、應（甲）提倡植棉、（乙）實施檢騐、（丙）設立棉　統計機關、（二）棉業方面、應（甲）創設大規模之運銷公司、（乙）創設打包廠、及（丙）建築棉花堆棧、（三）金融界方面、應（甲）扶助大規模之棉花運銷機關及（乙）推廣棉花之押匯押欵、各點均詳細說明、洵可爲棉業良好的參考、</p>

<p>(Nanjing) At the opening ceremony of the First Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee on the morning of the 22nd, Yu Youren delivered a speech, the original text of which is as follows: "Fellow comrades, today we are holding the first plenary session of the Fourth Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang. In this solemn and historic opening ceremony, we deeply feel that the convening of this First Plenary Session is due to the urgency of the national crisis, the expectations of the people, and mutual understanding and concession among comrades. To be able to hold this plenary session, we must also report to the Premier with sorrowful silence about the convening of this plenary session. We must also remember that this plenary session is the first plenary session since the death of the Premier and the first plenary session since there was a plenary session. Therefore, the success we must achieve this time must be an unprecedented success. We try to caress the wounds of the past. In these wounds, we do not know how much blood and tears of comrades, nor how much blood and tears of the people. Fortunately, in the continuous difficulties, comrades have felt the necessity of sincere unity, which has enabled the party to move from division to unity and from fragmentation to integrity. It can be seen that under a common belief, there are no opinions that cannot be sacrificed, no feelings that cannot be coordinated, and no roads that cannot be turned back. Many comrades and many people have used countless blood and tears to lay the foundation for a path for us. Therefore, this plenary session must require everyone to exhaust their minds, exert their efforts, and make a general solution to the internal and external troubles of the country. Only in this way can we comfort the hopes of the people and the demands of comrades, and can we complete the mission of this plenary session. This plenary session can bring together comrades who are not easily able to gather together. In this meeting, everyone must be very frank in seeking to alleviate the national crisis and jointly plan the progress of party affairs. We have very clearly determined that saving the country must first save the party, and saving the party can save the country. The task of the plenary session is divided into the main points in this main place. First, the mission undertaken by our party is related to the future of the entire country and nation, and even more related to all mankind. The Three Principles of the People, if not realized in one day, means that the work of our party is not completed in one day. After a plenary session, there should be a push. This time, we must boldly open up a new path for the party, so that every party member can shoulder the work of revitalizing the party. We are determined and confident to create a new life for our country and nation and even for the people of the world. Secondly, during this national crisis, the plenary session should make extremely resolute efforts to eliminate all obstacles existing within the party and the country, and cut off all disputes. The general guidelines of the party and the policies and systems of the country, whatever should be corrected, should be corrected happily, and whatever should be built, should be built happily, without shirking or delaying. The entire party serves as a driver for the people, and gives the people a strong guarantee to save the country and the nation. Furthermore, the most important aspect of the party's work in the future is its performance in the political field, so that political facilities become the crystallization of the party's work, and the system strives to be precise and effective. Policies should be practical and feasible, and people should be in the right positions and talents should be used appropriately. The success of politics is the success of the party. This time, we must focus on one proposition, which is to meet the people with good governance and to grant positions with caution, as the people expect. Recently, the reactionary situation surrounding our party has become increasingly tumultuous. Under our firm belief, we do not need to worry, but when we check our work, we cannot but be extremely wary. With such internal and external troubles, everyone feels that we must first work hard from the slogan of sincere unity. Now that the plenary session has opened, for our party and for our country and nation, I think everyone cannot help but wipe away tears and comfort each other. However, brothers believe that sincere unity is not only necessary for the party, but also for the entire country and the entire nation. Only then can this plenary session show its great significance. Perhaps some people say that this unity, in terms of party discipline and national law, inevitably has some shortcomings. I think we are wrong. If we can achieve sincere unity, it is enough to make up for this shortcoming and more. Sincere unity is the national law and the party discipline. We only need to always adhere to this sincere unity. Moreover, in the current situation, to save our country, and in the future, to build our country, the responsibility of saving and building the country is shouldered by the party. Party comrades should always keep in mind the only thing is sincere unity. Otherwise, the cause of saving and building the country will not be achieved. The period is so serious, and reactionaries are always creating rumors and slandering. Comrades must be conscientious, loyal to the party, and loyal to the country. The right and wrong of one thought is related to the survival of the country and the nation. This plenary session is where everyone shows this great spirit. We must be worthy of the Premier, worthy of the people, and worthy of the party and the country and nation. Everything must be seen in this meeting. The success of this plenary session is not only the success of our party, not only the success of our entire country and nation, but also the success of all mankind by following this path forward. Brothers are instructed by the conference to respectfully deliver this speech. (Special dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the opening ceremony of the First Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee on the morning of the 22nd, two cameramen specially sent by Paramount Pictures of the United States came to the Central Committee to produce a sound film. First, Mr. Lin Sen gave a short speech, saying that now that the country is in trouble and the party is in its infancy, everyone should unite. Our unity requires everyone to be of one mind and one heart, and to intensify their work. Everyone should bear their own responsibilities. The business community has the responsibility of the business community, the labor community has the responsibility of the labor community, the academic community has the responsibility of the academic community, and the agricultural community has the responsibility of the agricultural community. We must all bring out our full spirit, stand on the same front, and move forward. For example, the business community should do its best to promote domestic goods, and those with capital should cooperate with labor, increase work, and strive to manufacture domestic goods. The academic community should strive to engage in scientific research, train their bodies, and serve as a reserve for the country. The army should have good training, and the agricultural community should also strive for production, so that we can jointly save the country from the national crisis. Next, Wu Chaoshu gave a short speech in English. (Special dispatch on the 22nd)</p>

<p>Chiang and His Wife Travel by Plane</p>
<h3>To Return to Fenghua for Recuperation</h3>
<p>Parting Words to Students of Military Academy</p>
<p>Leaves Letter for Yu Youren Asking Not to Send Inquiries</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the opening of the plenary session on the 22nd, Chiang went to pay respects to the Premier's Mausoleum, and gathered all the students of the military academy and the students of the revolutionary martyrs' school in front of the mausoleum to give instructions, encouraging them to be diligent in their studies and prepare for national service, as parting words. At 1:00 PM, he went to the airport with his wife, Soong Meiling, and took his private plane to Shanghai, and then returned to Fenghua for recuperation. Another saying is that he went directly back to Fenghua. Those who accompanied him were Gao Lingri, Wang Shihe, etc. Before leaving, Chiang wrote a letter to Yu Youren and others, saying, "Now that the plenary session has opened, my responsibility is completed. If I do not leave again, it will be a hindrance to the party. Therefore, I have decided to return to my hometown to retire and find freedom. I only hope that the plenary session will achieve satisfactory results. No matter what, we must endure for the sake of the country, so that the government can be completed as soon as possible. I have no other intentions. I must enter the mountains for quiet recuperation. Please do not send letters or telegrams. Even if there are letters or telegrams, I will not open them." (Special dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain member of the Central Committee said that Chiang's spirit had been stimulated and his body was extremely tired in recent years, so he decided to take the opportunity to recuperate. Moreover, there were many criticisms of his past facilities. Chiang felt that since he could not be understood by all parties, it would be better to retire in time to wait for the virtuous. Now that the plenary session has opened, his responsibility has come to an end, so he left Nanjing and returned to his hometown today. (Special dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>( ) Former Chairman of the National Government Chiang Kai-shek and his wife, Soong Meiling, arrived at by plane at 3:30 PM on the 22nd, changed to a car, and went straight to Xikou, Fenghua.

<p>After Chiang Leaves Nanjing</p>
<h3>Various Committee Members Exchange Views</h3>
<p>Distributing Important Positions in the Government</p>
<p>Joint Telegram to Hu Hanmin Urging Him to Come</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After learning of Chiang's departure from Nanjing before today's preparatory meeting, the Guangdong and Nanjing committees exchanged views on the factual issues in a certain official residence, and first distributed the important positions in the government. They believed that the position of President of the Executive Yuan was related to the future reorganization of the provincial governments, and it was necessary for a leading figure of the party and the country to preside over it. Sun Ke's prestige was still insufficient, so it was proposed to choose one of Hu and Wang, and let Sun Ke be the Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance. As for the Ministers of the Army and Navy, in order to facilitate Chiang's assumption of the position of Chairman of the National Defense Council, they would temporarily retain their old positions without making any changes. Zou Lu was proposed as the Minister of Railways, Li Wenfan as the Minister of Communications, and the Ministry of Industry was given to the left wing, initially Gu Mengyu, but Gu Mengyu said he would not do it, and then Chen Gongbo was proposed. As for the organizational law of the National Government, it would not be changed for the time being. Moreover, the new government's financial plan has no specific plan yet. It is heard that it will be based on the Premier's will and start from the issue of seven lands. A land administration agency preparatory office will be specially established, and Ren Tuo is still in charge of its affairs. As for the Minister of Foreign Affairs, no one has taken office yet, because Wu Chaoshu will return to Guangdong. (Special dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After Chiang's plane took off, after the preparatory meeting was over, a group of Central Committee members gathered in a certain place to jointly telegraph Hu to report the real situation in Nanjing and urge him to go north to preside over it, because Hu had firmly stated that he would never come to the capital unless Chiang left Nanjing. (Special dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>Li Zongren Agrees</p>
<h3>People's Representative Conference</h3>
<p>Wang Gu and Others Plan to…</p>
<p>Draft a Plan for the National Salvation Conference</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Li Zongren telegraphed Sun Ke, saying that the proposal to convene a People's Representative Conference to jointly assume responsibility with the new government as a transition to preparing for constitutional government is a good idea and a brilliant vision, and he strongly agrees. Mr. Wang previously advocated the National Salvation Conference, and I have telegraphed my approval. I hope you will consider it. (Special dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The organizational plan for the National Salvation Conference has been drafted by Wang Jingwei, Gu Mengyu, and Chen Gongbo, and will be submitted to the conference in the name of Wang within the next few days for a decision. It is heard that its constituent members will be based on various professional groups across the country, which is roughly the same as the constituent members of the National Assembly. However, whether party departments and military units at all levels can send representatives to participate is still under discussion. (Special dispatch on the 22nd)</p>

<p>Current Events Commentary</p>
<h3>Respectfully Offered to the First Plenary Session—Military Reorganization</h3>
<p>Today, if we desire to clarify politics, prevent internal strife, address the deep-seated maladies of our nation and people, and rescue the masses of common people from misery, we must rigorously reorganize the military and thoroughly reform the military system. This will ensure that soldiers cannot interfere in politics and that the army becomes a true force of the nation and its people. It will also prevent ambitious and ruthless individuals from exploiting the people and disrupting the country. This is of paramount importance and the essential remedy for clarifying the stagnant, twenty-year-old chaotic political situation.</p>
<p>Our country today supports over two million soldiers, not including the so-called police, local defense forces, security teams, and unaffiliated irregular troops recruited and equipped independently. The nation spends over 80% of its national currency annually on maintaining the military, not including the forced military expenses levied by various provinces and localities, and the various local defense and security fees borne by the people. The country supports such a large military, and the people bear such a heavy military burden. Yet, the result is the cultivation of warlords who have emerged in succession over the past twenty years, leading to endless civil wars. This has further eroded the nation and brought misery to the people. The situation today is precarious and cannot continue. Therefore, our country's military is not only insufficient to defend the country and protect the people but is also sufficient to harm the country and endanger the people. The country should not value such a military, and the people should not value such a force.</p>
<p>Looking at the present situation, each province has its own army, and each region has its own army. Each forms its own system and establishes its own faction. There is a veiled hostility between the factions. Each demarcates its own defense area and maintains strict vigilance. The national military expenditure is fixed annually, but the soldiers' pay is constantly in arrears. Funds are raised locally by collecting levies from each household. Each is increasingly aggressive in expanding its power, squeezing each other out and being mutually suspicious. At the extreme of this squeezing, war breaks out. Former comrades become enemies today. They slander each other without holding back. Before long, they shake hands and make peace, cheerfully reminiscing about the past. The cycle repeats itself. However, the wounds and suffering inflicted upon the people increase year by year. Recalling the period of the Northern Expedition, the Party's army and the people were united, and the army practically relieved the people's suffering, rescuing them from dire circumstances. This truly evokes the feeling of an aging palace maid reminiscing about the flourishing Tang dynasty, an unbearable memory. Because of this, politics and party affairs are controlled by the military. The land and people within the reach of the military's power become their exclusive domain. The result of extortion and war is that the people become increasingly impoverished, and more become refugees. When the people can find no way to survive, they resort to joining the army as their only option. Ruthless individuals with real power give them a few dollars a month, clothe them in gray uniforms, and order them to be loyal hounds for personal gain. The military leaders act as employers, knowing only of individuals, knowing nothing of the nation, nothing of the people, and nothing of their inherent duty to defend the country and protect the people. With such soldiers, they are brave in internal strife but cowardly in resisting foreign aggression. If we do not want to save our nation and people from danger, then so be it. If not, then this situation must not be allowed to continue. Today, we must use decisive measures to thoroughly reorganize the military, reform the military system, and strictly prohibit military interference in politics, ensuring that military rule never has a chance to revive.</p>
<p>What is the way to reorganize? It is to unify the organization, unify the command, restrict recruitment, implement land reclamation, establish pay, distribute it equally, provide education and training, improve the treatment of soldiers, strictly prohibit exploitation by officers, break their factional prejudices, and separately station troops in important fortresses, so that they actually bear the responsibility of defending the country and protecting the people. Only in this way can we prevent military interference in politics, prevent internal strife, and give our nation and people a chance to be reborn.</p>
<p>Japan today dominates East Asia and surveys the world like a tiger. The prosperity of its national power has reached its peak. However, its internal affairs are arrogant and tyrannical, and the hidden dangers will inevitably erupt one day. Our national strength is far inferior to Japan, and the arrogance and tyranny of our military are even greater. The present predicament is not without cause. If we do not fundamentally change course and thoroughly reform from now on, the future of the country will be bleak and hopeless.</p>

<p>Dai Chuanxian</p>
<h3>Submitting Resignation from All Concurrent Positions</h3>
<p>National Government Order to Persuade to Remain</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Dai Chuanxian has been suffering from a nervous disorder. Previously, the illness flared up severely, affecting his stomach and intestines, so he went to Baohua Mountain for recuperation. Recently, as the illness has not yet improved, he has specially submitted a request to the Central National Government to resign from his positions as government committee member and president of the Examination Yuan, etc., stating that since the establishment of the capital and the creation of the five-yuan system, he has shouldered heavy responsibilities with his inherently ailing body and lack of academic experience, and has concurrently handled work several times his primary duty. He has repeatedly requested to resign, but has not been granted permission. However, as the country faces many difficulties, he has had to勉强撑持. Now that unification has been achieved, he is specially requesting to resign from all his concurrent positions to make way for capable individuals and to facilitate his recovery. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After receiving Dai Chuanxian's resignation, the National Government sent a letter from the Civil Affairs Office to Dai, stating: "Respectfully informing you, upon receiving your committee member's submission, stating that you are requesting to resign from all concurrent positions due to illness, the chairman instructed that the country is currently facing difficulties, and the central government bears heavy responsibilities. We have long relied on your hard work and perseverance to support us through difficult times. Given your loyalty to the country, why not set aside these matters and return to your duties to reassure the public? We earnestly hope for this." Correspondingly recording the instructions and informing you for your reference. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government instructed the Examination Yuan, stating: "We have received your submission. Since the president of the Yuan assumed heavy responsibilities and created a new model, all measures have been praised and benefited. We hope you will maintain your initial loyalty to the Party and the country, accomplish the grand plan of cultivating talents for a hundred years, overcome difficulties together, and not shirk your responsibilities. This is our earnest expectation. This order." (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Domestic Important Telegrams Three</p>
<p>Gu Weijun</p>
<h3>Issuing Declaration to Foreign Countries</h3>
<p>The Manchurian Incident is Not Merely a Chinese Issue</p>
<p>The Nine-Power Treaty Must Undergo a Serious Test</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Gu Weijun has issued a declaration on the Northeast issue to newspapers in Europe and America. The full text is excerpted and translated as follows: "A great American statesman once predicted that the Pacific Ocean would become the center of international political explosions, and that the developments on its coastal lands would have a significant impact on the future of the world. The signs of this prediction can now be said to have materialized in Manchuria. Since Japan's unwarranted occupation of Manchuria by force, not only is peace in the Far East difficult to guarantee, but also the optimism that humanity has held for the world since the European war has been completely dispelled. For three hundred years, Manchuria has been part of China, with Chinese people accounting for 80% of its population, while Japanese people account for only 1%. Its rich agricultural, mineral, and natural resources make it the leader in China, its railway mileage accounts for two-thirds of the total in China, and its foreign trade accounts for an important position in the total foreign trade of China. Such a rich and vast land should originally belong to China. From a purely legal standpoint, Japan's occupation should have ended long ago. In addition, there are several reasons why Japan should promptly remedy its unreasonable actions in Manchuria. Manchuria's important position in international transportation means that if it is occupied by another country, the balance of international forces will gradually be disrupted, and the position of the ten countries along the Pacific coast will face a major danger, which is bound to trigger an international war. Recognizing this situation, former US Secretary of State John Hay issued his declaration respecting China's territorial integrity, and former US President Roosevelt made great efforts to mediate the Russo-Japanese Treaty of Portsmouth, so that China could recover Manchuria. Subsequently, US President Wilson protested against Japan's demands on China's Twenty-One Demands. US President Harding and Secretary of State Hughes also signed the Nine-Power Treaty, all to preserve China's territorial integrity and ensure that Manchuria would forever belong to China. In short, the Manchurian issue is not merely a Chinese issue but an international issue. The resolution of this issue has a significant impact on the future of the world and a great impact on the issue of arms reduction in Europe. Various guarantees of international peace, such as the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the League of Nations Covenant, are closely related to this issue. As for the most famous achievement of the United States, the so-called Nine-Power Treaty, its first article stipulates that China's sovereignty, independence, territorial, and administrative integrity should be respected. Now that such a situation has occurred, the treaty itself must undergo the most serious test." (22nd Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Gu Weijun submitted his resignation again and flew to Shanghai on the 22nd. The ministry's affairs are being handled by the vice-minister, Jin Wensi. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>League of Nations Investigation Team</p>
<h3>Representatives Chosen from Five Countries</h3>
<p>Departing Around the End of January</p>
<p>(Paris) Received a telegram from Geneva tonight, predicting the organization of the Manchurian Investigation Team. It is said that the British representative is Lord Lytton, former Governor-General of India, the French representative is General Claudel, the German representative is Dr. Schnee, former Governor of German East Africa, the Italian representative is Marquis Paulucci di Calboli, former Ambassador to Germany, and the US representative is Hines, the wartime US military railway superintendent in France. It is estimated that the investigation team will go to the Far East around the end of January. Reuters has learned that the above prediction is still premature, as although the above-mentioned people have been invited to join the investigation team, they have not yet agreed, so their names have not yet been submitted to China and Japan for their approval. The investigation team can only be officially established after China and Japan agree. In any case, the investigation team may not be able to depart before the end of January. The US representative, Hines, is the most likely to take office among the five. Hines has served as a League of Nations arbitrator for resolving issues related to the navigation of European rivers based on treaty judgments and has represented the League of Nations in investigating Rhine and Danube River navigation incidents. The State Department in Washington recently notified the League of Nations, stating that it does not oppose Hines being a member of the neutral investigation team. It is heard that Yoshida, the Japanese associate member of the investigation team, will leave his position as ambassador to Switzerland, likely arriving in Paris first to discuss the investigation team's issues before departing for Tokyo.

<h3>Issuing Statement Regarding Jinzhou</h3>
<p>No Longer Issuing an Ultimatum</p>
<p>Deceiving the Eyes and Ears of the World</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Army issued a statement today regarding the beginning of the suppression of bandits in western Liaoning, as follows: "Since the outbreak of the Manchurian Incident, the temporary government established in Jinzhou, under the orders of Zhang Xueliang, has concentrated the Northeast Army in the vicinity and manipulated bandits and special forces to disrupt the security of all of Manchuria. Moreover, taking advantage of the river's freezing, their actions have become increasingly active. Zhang Xueliang is using the League of Nations and the United States' concern for Jinzhou to consolidate his base for instigating anti-Japanese actions and continuing his anti-Japanese behavior. Our Kwantung Army previously temporarily suspended its bandit suppression operations in western Liaoning, exerting all efforts to endure and exercise self-restraint, hoping for the Chinese side's reflection. However, Zhang Xueliang, who has no sincerity, continues to advocate anti-Japanese sentiment, using Jinzhou as a base to disrupt the security of Manchuria through planned and provocative attempts. Given this situation, our Kwantung Army's self-defense is also unavoidable. We hereby declare in advance that in the event that the Chinese army near Jinzhou aids the bandits and engages in provocative behavior, our army, for the sake of self-defense, will resolutely punish them without hesitation. The people of all of Manchuria will thereby attain the beginning of happiness and tranquility, and the sacrifice of a small part will also be unavoidable." (22nd Japan United Press Telegram)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) The Kwantung Army issued a statement to both domestic and foreign audiences, explaining that its decision to suppress bandits was unavoidable and stating clearly that if anyone interferes with its actions, it will resolutely repel them. In a certain sense, this statement contains the nature of an ultimatum to the Jinzhou side. Therefore, the ultimatum demanding the withdrawal of the Jinzhou army can be considered unnecessary to issue again. (22nd Japan United Press Telegram)</p>
<h3>Harbin Property Rights Surrendered</h3>
<p>(Harbin) The property rights of real estate owned by foreigners in the Harbin Special District have never been recognized by China and have become an unresolved issue.

The exchange of memoranda will be held on the 25th of this month. (21st Japan United Press Telegram)</p>

<p>British Newspaper Condemns</p>
<h3>Japan's Christmas War</h3>
<p>(The Pen Has Not Touched Ink, But the Sword Has Already Been Drawn)</p>
<p>London: The London Daily News published an editorial today entitled "Japan's Christmas War," criticizing the situation that the League of Nations investigation team will encounter, saying that "the pen has not touched ink, but the sword has already been drawn." The newspaper compared Japan's general attack of suppressing (bandits) to the past occupation of Korea, saying that "this analogy is ominous, but it is very obvious." The most avoidable thing that can happen at the moment is an offensive by the Chinese army. Any Japanese person with a little knowledge who reads Gu Weijun's message to the United States will understand the impact it will inevitably have on the Japanese public, which is very concerned about Japan. Those who violate world opinion will rarely gain anything. Those who inflict a major blow on the hope of a sounder and more peaceful world will find that the regrettable comfort of their sins will ultimately be unattainable. (22nd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>America's Strange Attitude</h3>
<p>Actually Sympathizing with the Activities of the Japanese Army</p>
<p>(Washington) US Secretary of State Stimson declared today that he had not yet received official confirmation of the Japanese army's attack on Jinzhou. Stimson did not want to speculate on the situation in Jinzhou based on newspaper reports. Last month, Japan mistakenly attributed Stimson's remarks to being a criticism of the Japanese government. Afterwards, the United States remained silent and did not send an official document to the Japanese government. Also, a few weeks ago, US Ambassador to Japan Forbes informally notified the Japanese Foreign Ministry that the League of Nations and the United States viewed the Japanese army's attack on Jinzhou as a very unfortunate event. Since then, the United States has been silent on the Liaoning case. However, Washington now also admits that it is paying close attention to the activities of the Japanese army in the three eastern provinces, but believes that this large-scale Japanese military advance is aimed at eliminating bandits and unofficial Chinese troops.

<h3>Receives the Press in the Capital</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A delegation of 31 representatives from various universities in Shanghai arrived in Nanjing on the morning of the 22nd. In the afternoon, they held a tea party at the Central Hotel to receive the press. More than 20 people attended. Lu Zurong, representative of the Law School, chaired the meeting and reported that everyone was extremely saddened and indignant at the violent Japanese occupation of various parts of Northeast China. It was generally believed that the life and death of the country and the nation were major issues. Petitions had been repeatedly submitted to the National Government in Nanjing, but no satisfactory results were obtained. Demonstrations were then held jointly to express the spirit of sacrifice and struggle. However, the result was extremely tragic, and some of our students were unable to sacrifice themselves in resisting violence, but sacrificed themselves first in the patriotic movement. It is extremely heartbreaking. Now that the First Plenary Session has opened and national affairs are being discussed together, it seems that this can be called a turning point for the country. The mission of our visit to Nanjing this time is to demand the release of arrested students, investigate and console missing and injured students in Nanjing, request investigation and punishment of the murderers and instigators of the tragic incident, demand that such incidents not occur again in the future, welcome back the bodies of the dead, and request compensation. Please punish Tao Baichuan, Chen Xizeng, and others, the murderers of the January 29th Incident in Shanghai. In addition, we also plan to petition the Plenary Session and the government for: 1. Declaration of war against Japan; 2. Implementation of revolutionary diplomacy; 3. Rejection of the unfair resolution of the League of Nations; 4. Opposition to secret diplomacy; 5. Recovery of lost territory in Northeast China; 6. Strengthening of national defense; 7. Announcement of major policies; 8. Guarantee of popular movements; 9. Guarantee of all freedoms of the people; 10. Absolute openness of finance; 11. Permanent cessation of all internal wars; 12. Unite with all oppressed peoples of the world to fight together.

<p>Defeat Foreign Ink and Solve the Difficulty of Chinese Paper. Please Use Invincible Brand Double-Purpose Ink.</p>
<p>(1) For fountain pens, use a small piece of sponge soaked in the inkwell. Any fountain pen tip can write smoothly and freely. New nibs often have oil on them, so it is advisable to heat them with a match once, after which they will always absorb ink and will not rust. Writing on any Chinese paper will not bleed and will dry immediately, so it is not necessary to use blotting paper. (2) For brushes, the cotton batting of old-fashioned steel ink boxes can also be replaced with sponge to avoid drying and bad odor. For large calligraphy scrolls and couplets, it is best to pour the ink into a ceramic cup for use. After use, the remaining ink can still be returned to the bottle. If it is too thick, you can add boiling water to dilute it as desired.</p>

<h3>Fiftieth National Affairs Conference</h3>
<p>Relaxation of Wheat Flour Ban Approved for Another Year</p>
<p>Transfer of Zhang Zhongdao to Ministry of Education as Counselor</p>
<p>Appointment of Zhou Fohai as Director of Jiangsu Department of Education</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan held its 50th National Affairs Conference on the 22nd, attended by Yang Shuzhuang, Wang Boqun, Kong Xiangxi, Chen Mingshu, Ma Fuxiang, Li Shuhua, Liu Ruiheng, and He Yingqin, chaired by Chen Mingshu. The following matters were discussed: (1) The Ministry of Finance reported that the one-year trial period for the relaxation of the ban on the export of domestic wheat flour had been reported to the Executive Yuan for approval and record. Now that the trial period has expired, the ban on export should be implemented as per the original plan. Later, the Shanghai Flour Mill Trade Association submitted a report stating that the flour sold by various factories overseas only refers to places such as Dalian, Hong Kong, and the South Seas Islands, where the overseas Chinese there are accustomed to eating Chinese flour. If a ban is imposed, it would hinder their patriotism and give foreign flour the opportunity to sell. The flour eaten by disaster victims is all third and fourth-grade flour, while the flour exported is all second-grade yuan flour. Therefore, the export of wheat flour does not affect disaster victims, and it is still requested that the relaxation of the ban be continued. After inspecting the various sections requested by the association, they were found to be true. Except for the third and fourth-grade flour, which should still be banned from export to maintain the people's food supply, the second-grade flour can be allowed to continue to be relaxed for one year, from December 1 of this year to November 30 of the 21st year. It is appropriate to submit it for verification and recording. Decision: Approve the recording. (2) Decision: Please appoint Li Limin as the Simplified Appointment Secretary of the Executive Yuan. (3) Decision: Please appoint Rao Guozhang as the Colonel Academic Education Management Officer of the Aviation School of the Ministry of Military Affairs. (4) Decision: Cheng Tianfang, Member of the Jiangsu Provincial Government and Director of the Department of Education, submitted a request for resignation, which was forwarded for approval. Please appoint Zhou Fohai to succeed him. (5) Decision: Zhao Naichuan, Counselor of the Ministry of Education, has been appointed elsewhere and submitted a request for resignation, which should be approved. Please transfer Zhang Zhongdao, Director of the Nanjing Municipal Education Bureau, to fill the vacancy.</p>

On the 16th, people from all walks of life were extremely surprised when they received the news. Some people went to the provincial government to visit Zang but were not received. It is said that since the incident, Zang has been under strict surveillance by the Japanese, who have repeatedly used threats to force him to take charge of the provincial government, but Zang has remained unmoved. This time, his sudden appointment as governor must have a secret behind it. After investigation by various parties, it was learned that it was all orchestrated by the traitor Zhao Xinbo, who acted on the instructions of the Japanese. Initially, Zhao, in his capacity as mayor, convened a meeting of all members and directors of the industrial and commercial associations on the 15th, ostensibly to discuss tax issues. When the meeting began, all the directors and secretaries of the municipal government attended. First, Feng Hanqing (secretary-general of the municipal government) explained that the people of Shenyang were in dire straits, and the Maintenance Association could not alleviate the suffering of the people, so it was necessary to organize a provincial government, and that the former chairman, Zang Shiyi, was the most suitable candidate for governor. He then took out a prepared proposal and, under the surveillance of police officers carrying guns and live ammunition, forced all the members and directors to sign it. At this time, Zhao Xinbo also arrived, bringing with him two hundred self-defense police and security team members. Zhao first expressed how much he loved the country and the people, saying that it was necessary to establish a provincial government in the current situation. Then he ordered everyone present not to leave and forced them to sign the document before going to the Maintenance Association. Yuan Jin saw them and asked why they had come, but no one from the industrial and commercial associations spoke. Then someone from the municipal government took out the prepared proposal and gave it to Yuan to read. The gist of it was that on December 15th of the 20th year, all the people of Fengtian held a meeting at the Chamber of Commerce and resolved to request that the Maintenance Association and all agencies in the provincial capital resign en masse and publicly invite Zang Gong to take office as governor. As soon as Yuan saw it, he knew what they meant and immediately said that he had long wanted to relinquish his responsibility and that this was very good. He immediately drafted a public letter to dissolve the Maintenance Association and invite Zang to take office as governor. During this time, Kan Chaoxi gave a passionate speech, saying that today he saw police and security teams guarding the provincial government with live ammunition, and he did not know what was going on. It turned out that they wanted the members of the Maintenance Association to resign. It was a pity that he and the others had no foresight and felt deeply ashamed. However, thinking back to the past, he could not help but sigh. He originally intended to come out to maintain the city and seek safety for the people, but he did not expect things to get worse and worse, and eventually he broke away from the National Government and Deputy Commander Zhang, causing the people of the whole country to scold him. Even if he died now, he would be sorry to his ancestors and could be called a sinner for all time. Kan's complaint was a subtle rebuke to Zhao Xinbo, because this matter was entirely created by Zhao Xinbo alone, and he had not notified them beforehand. After Yuan Jinkai finished writing the public letter, they all went to Zang Shiyi's residence to make a superficial request. Although Zang repeatedly said that he was afraid that he would not be able to do the job, he did not firmly decline. So everyone escorted Zang to the provincial government to take office. It is said that Zang only left Japanese surveillance and returned to his private residence the day before, perhaps on the condition of taking on this puppet government. (16th)</p>
<h3>Tragic Incident of Students' Petition in Taiyuan</h3>
<p>Provincial Party Department's Discipline Squad Opens Fire, Wounding Many</p>
<p>Authorities Investigate Students' Petition and Seal Off Provincial and Municipal Party Departments</p>
<p>Taiyuan Dispatch: Yesterday (the 18th) morning at 9:00 AM, the Shanxi Provincial Student Anti-Japanese United Association convened an anti-Japanese national salvation conference of various schools in Zhongshan Park, with more than 3,000 people attending. After the meeting, it was decided that the entire team would go to the provincial party department. When they arrived at the gate of the department, it was tightly closed. After repeated negotiations, five students were allowed to enter as representatives. Unexpectedly, the provincial party department suddenly ordered the discipline squad to surround the students and beat them with wooden sticks, followed by opening fire and throwing bombs. Thirteen students were seriously injured on the spot, and many were slightly injured. City Garrison Commander Rong Hongquan rushed to the scene to maintain order and first sent the injured students to hospitals such as Langsu for treatment, while comforting the remaining students. All the students then made three demands to Rong, including the closure of the provincial and municipal party departments. Rong agreed to comply. At 8:00 PM that night, the provincial and municipal party departments were sealed off, and party committee members Han Kewen, Su Shouyu, and others were detained in the garrison headquarters. Mu Guangzheng, a student at Jinshan Middle School who was most seriously injured, died that night. The situation after the tragic incident is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Emergency Meeting of Various Schools: Yesterday afternoon at 6:00 PM, middle schools and above in the provincial capital held a joint emergency meeting at the Confucian Temple. Representatives from 19 schools, including the Law School, attended. Chairman Zhang Shengxiu presided over the meeting. After the opening ceremony, the chairman reported on the incident that occurred today, stating that the association's petition was organized and could take full responsibility for the petition. It was not like the previous incident where the provincial government and school students慰問 various schools' petition representatives met unexpectedly without any organization. In view of the impropriety of the previous incident, the fourth executive committee resolved that the petition should form a 200-member discipline squad to maintain order and avoid the temporary inability to suppress the students. The provincial party department, which號負 民衆 領導, deliberately massacred patriotic youth, with extremely strict security, as if deploying an army. They originally wanted the students to send representatives to petition to avoid any conflict. After pushing more than ten representatives to see them, without specifically presenting the petition matters, the party department executive immediately ordered the department's discipline squad to massacre the representatives and the petitioning students outside. In view of the representatives not coming out and such strict defenses, fearing that there would be no good result, they sent representatives to see them for the second time, but they were not received and were given the same order to shoot the students outside. For a time, order was disrupted, representatives were killed inside, and students were killed outside, beaten and then driven out of the gate. According to subsequent investigations, more than 20 people were seriously injured, and countless were slightly injured. Jinshan student Mu Guangzheng died due to serious injuries. It was also heard that the department threw several representatives who were beaten into the well. In addition to a detailed investigation report to the authorities, this report is first to clarify the truth. The following ten resolutions were passed: (1) Submit to the central and Shanxi military and political authorities the names of the murderers who shot and killed unarmed student representatives and citizens, including Han Kewen, Yao Dahai, Hu Boyue, Chou Yuan, Li Min, Li Fen, Liang Xanda, Li Jinxian, Liu Guanru, Su Shouyu, and the entire provincial committee.

<h3>The Fall of Wuyuan County, Anhui</h3>
<p>Wuhu Dispatch: The area of Huizhou, southern Anhui, is adjacent to Jiangxi. Ever since　黨 occupied Ganzhou Province, the border areas have been disturbed. Fortunately, Huizhou is mostly mountainous, and many people make a living by hunting. They are skilled in shooting and united, so their self-defense is very strong, and they have not suffered major damage. Unexpectedly, a large group of bandits from Ganzhou Province, about a thousand people, suddenly窜 to Wuyuan. The county magistrate, Qi Qingchi, received the news in advance and did not plan to resist. He secretly took his wives and concubines to Tunxi and Yan City, and hid in Wuhu, leaving no one in charge. As a result, the city fell.

Moreover, the police team and hunters have more than 300 guns, which can be defended. After the bandits entered the city, they once opened fire with the police team, but due to the disparity in numbers and lack of leadership, the police team could not resist and retreated.)

<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Opening and Dredging Baitang Pond is Opposed by Villagers to Project A: Baitang Pond in the northeastern township of this county, with water flowing through seven counties, is the main river of the county. The discharge of Lake Tai depends entirely on this river. Recently, due to years of disrepair, the river channel downstream has been silted up. In addition, this year's river tide has been氾滥, and the farmland along the pond has been damaged. Therefore, the villagers there have sent letters and telegrams, requesting that it be opened and dredged. The Provincial Construction Department ordered the Taihu Lake Water Conservancy Basin Committee to send personnel to investigate. As a result, two projects were formulated. Project A is to截灣取直 Baitang Pond near the Zhitang area and open a new river to connect it, costing 60,000 yuan. Project B is to流浚 the original road, costing only more than 20,000 yuan. The Construction Department designated Project A to be implemented. After receiving the order, the construction bureau sent a surveying team to survey. However, the farmers did not 主 Project A and beat the surveyors, causing the work to be suspended. According to the乡 villagers, Project A has more harm than good. Moreover,截灣取直 requires a huge amount of 60,000 yuan in wages, and the闸口 of Baitangkou is not included. Building the闸 is very important, because if Baitang has no閘口,　　 water can easily rush in, and the farmers along the pond will be in greater danger. Moreover,退水 is not easy, and潮 沙 is more likely to accumulate. For a radical cure, the闸口 should be built first, which will be beneficial. Now舍本求末 is done, and only the 河身閘浚 is built, which is劳而无功. For the present plan, the fixed dredging Baitang Pond funds should be divided into a portion to be used as the funds for building the gate. The remaining money can then be used to dredge the original road, which will be 力半功倍. Currently, those who strongly advocate this project include Qian, the former chief of the 15th district and a native of Zhitang　　, etc., and Jin Xiangqiu, the current chief of the 6th district, and Gu Zhaorui of the 11th district, etc. They have separately requested the county government to转 to the Construction Department to change the original Project A to Project B.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Chen Jianxiao is Unwilling to Serve as Director of Jiangxi Education Department</h3>
<p>He is Very Interested in Serving as a Professor of Psychology and Education at Wuhan University</p>
<p>Wuchang Dispatch: A few days ago, the National Government issued a clear order to reorganize the Jiangxi Provincial Government, and the former Director of the Ministry of Education, Chen Jian　, was appointed as the provincial party committee member and director of the Education Department. Chen returned to the south from Shanghai and told reporters that he had recently been sent by Wuhan University to petition in Nanjing. Although he had contacted the central government and the Ministry of Education several times to discuss petition matters, he had not heard about the reorganization of the Jiangxi Provincial Government. This time, he was suddenly ordered to take the position, which was unexpected. In recent years, he has been serving as a professor of psychology and education at Wuhan University and feels that the research atmosphere in the school is very strong. His personal interest in reading has deepened, and he has a very harmonious relationship with his colleagues and classmates. He does not want to leave this leisurely environment and re-enter the political whirlpool. Therefore, he intends to request the central government to resign as soon as he receives a formal order.</p>
<p>Anhui Education Department Chief</p>
<h3>Yang Zhongming Acting Director Duties</h3>
<p>Provincial Government Resolution: Acting during the period before He Qigong arrives</p>
<p>The position of Director of the Anhui Education Department has been vacant since Cheng Tianfang resigned from the position in the spring of this year. The central government then announced that Li Zhonggong would be a member of the provincial committee and concurrently serve as the director. Li took leave of absence due to illness and has not yet taken office. During the period of this year's summer, when the old and new years are接, all plans and facilities for education in the province need to be carried out responsibly. The position of Director should not be left懸虚 for another day. The provincial government decided to nominate委员 Yu Enbo to兼代 to meet the urgent needs of the situation at that time. It has been half a year in a blink of an eye. Recently, Yu felt that his energy was insufficient due to illness, and he was deeply afraid that there would be遺误 in the performance of his duties during this autumn of national crisis and multiple events. Therefore, he resigned from the兼职 to the central government and the provincial government. The authorities have understood. Since Li Zhonggong was unable to销假 to take office, the central government issued a clear order to appoint 省委 He Qigong to兼行 the Director of the Education Department. It is not certain when He will come to Anhui. Yu is eager to leave for recuperation. On the 18th of this month, the provincial government committee meeting decided to appoint Yang Zhongming, chief of the department, to perform the duties of the director before Director He arrives. It is learned that Yang took over on the 19th.</p>

The entire faculty and staff of the National Jinan University in Shanghai respectfully salute you."</p>

The government has repeatedly issued warnings and exerted all efforts to resist. We earnestly implore you to order the generals and soldiers on the front lines in Jinzhou to consolidate their forces and firmly defend the city, sacrificing themselves for the city. Furthermore, reinforcements should be sent immediately to avoid repeating past mistakes and abandoning the people again." (Urgent)</p>

East China maneuvered several times, and Liang Guoquan and Chen Qidong scored successively, tying the score. Then Liang and Chen scored again. East China's momentum suddenly rose, and Yun, Li, and Jun each contributed. The score gradually became 26 to 7, with East China taking the lead in the first half. In the second half, East China had more than enough heart but not enough strength. The Red Team was different from the day before, and within eight minutes, the Red Team scored nine points, while East China did not score at all. The disparity was so great. Fortunately, Liang Guoquan scored three times alone, reversing the misfortune, and then they took turns advancing. As a result, East China defeated the Red Team 34 to 21.</p>

<h3>Recollections from Dai Liang</h3>
<p>— Yan Zi</p>
<p>After I reached adulthood, I quite enjoyed seeking pleasure. One day, I accidentally ascended to the upper floor of a restaurant with some friends. From the adjacent room, we heard stringed instruments accompanied by croaking and chirping songs, which I found rather peculiar. I asked the waiter, who told me they were Japanese prostitutes. A friend, being fond of such things, asked the waiter to bring the Japanese prostitutes' registry. Upon reviewing it, the prostitutes' names were followed by their photographs. They had high buns and wide-sleeved shirts, with nothing attractive to be found. The waiter, flattering from the side, said, "These are famous prostitutes who sing well," and "These are famous prostitutes who are good at battle." My friend casually responded by sending a note summoning two Japanese prostitutes to our table (mostly from the Hongqiao area). They were about the same age, their faces plastered with powder, almost resembling Cao Cao forcing the palace. Upon seeing them, I felt nauseous, but my friend forcibly made me sit beside them. Although we couldn't communicate verbally, they were exceedingly attentive. I felt awkward, like a colt under a cart. I reached into my pocket, took out three "eagle wing" coins, and tossed them to them, urging them to leave. The prostitutes bowed and thanked me before departing, and I felt as if a great weight had been lifted. From then on, I swore to my friend that I would never again suffer such an ordeal. The hardship of that evening held an unspeakable pain. What is the point of seeking pleasure?</p>

<h3>Mr. Gandhi Elaborates on the French (Part 2)</h3>
<p>In Asia, after the Sino-French War in 1884, Annam became a French protectorate. Guangzhou Bay was leased from China in 1898. These areas, along with Cochinchina, Laos, and Cambodia, were governed by a single French Governor-General. Now, there are rumors that French troops are invading our southwest. Although the French Minister has denied this, judging from the historical trend, only a fool would believe that France has no ambition to expand its Asian empire.</p>
<p>A so-called republic that proclaims liberty, equality, and fraternity has also become a high-achieving student of imperialism. What justification can there be for its contradictions? The French themselves defend it by saying:</p>
<p>(Expanding colonies is a cultural mission because inferior races are unworthy of practicing liberty, equality, and fraternity unless they are taught.)</p>
<p>Near Annam is an autonomous country called Siam. There are sixty students per thousand people. In Annam under the French cultural mission, there are only seven students per thousand people. Where did this cultural mission go?</p>
<p>If the French can truly put liberty, equality, and fraternity into practice after receiving Mr. Gandhi's compliments, they will not have failed his good intentions.</p>
<p>But comparing the British and French colonial methods, India can produce Gandhi. If Gandhi were in Annam, he would have been shot long ago. Therefore, Mr. Gandhi's compliments to the French are not only unconvincing to the Moroccans, Arabs, Black Berbers, and Annamese but even the British might not consider it fair.</p>
<p>Weak nations must each seek their own way. How can they turn things around? Indians must cast their eyes beyond India to achieve some success. Chinese people must also have this realization, only then will there be light in the future.</p>
<h3>Remembering Huang Yunzhi of Jiading</h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>Huang Yunzhi was a well-known figure in our town. He passed away on the second day of last month at the Dahua Hospital in Shanghai. The news of his death spread, and those who heard it mourned him. On the nineteenth, a memorial service was held at the town's public lecture hall, attended by nearly a thousand people, filling the hall. Huang Renzhi from Shanghai also arrived in Jiading by car that afternoon to attend the service. During his speech, he wept uncontrollably. As the saying goes, "A lifetime and a death reveal the depth of friendship." This is also my sentiment for this man. Zhang Yijun of Suzhou also composed a poem in his memory: "Tao'an no longer writes, the Western Villa has passed away, pressed by the difficulties of the time, extraordinary talents emerge. The mainland has not yet sunk, but you have already left, the whole city mourns the fall of a mountain covered in peach and plum blossoms." "(How many times did we sit knee-to-knee in the car? Suddenly, the harmonica evoked the feeling of meeting Ziqi. Eight hundred miles can be reached in a snap of the fingers, may you be reborn in heaven to see the iron wheels speed." It not only mourns the loss of an old friend but also laments the national crisis, a feeling pent up inside that must be expressed.</p>
<p>Yunzhi's father, Wenhui, was devoted to classics and history. His elder brother, Quchen, was able to pass on the family learning and made many plans for the town's administration, authoring "Mouyi Bian," praised as a pioneering work. But Yunzhi was particularly rich in political knowledge. In the early years of the Republic, he served as a provincial assemblyman, known as one of the "Four Fierce Ones," because every time he attended a meeting, he seemed to have a bone stuck in his throat, unable to rest until he spoke his mind. Hong Boyan of Loudong, who knew about Shanghai County affairs, appointed him as the first section chief, relying on him as his right and left hand. Later, he became a writer for Xin Shen Bao, producing a thousand words daily, eagerly read by buyers. Before long, he disagreed with the authorities and immediately stopped writing. Chen Taoyi of Jinshan, a senior member of the Min Party, was invited to be the Governor of Jiangsu Province in 1925. Chen feared he would have difficulty managing the situation and hesitated for a long time. He wanted Yunzhi to be his secretary before agreeing. Therefore, Chen, despite being weak and hesitant to move, came to Jiading in person to pay his respects, showing the depth of their friendship.</p>
<p>Even more strangely, in the Huang family's thirty years, after Wenhui's death, followed by Quchen's, and now Yunzhi's sudden passing this year, all occurred ten years apart, as if predetermined. The family has always kept cats to catch mice. Whenever a death occurred, the cat always gave birth to five kittens, almost without fail.</p>
<h3>What I Saw and Heard</h3>
<p>— Da Wei</p>
<p>I saw a middle school student and asked him how the national situation was. He said, "We're busy with meetings, propaganda, and petitions. We don't have time to read the newspaper."</p>
<p>I called the school to find them. They all said they were busy saving the country. I bumped into them at the entrance of a movie theater. They all said they were doing propaganda work in the theater. I remained silent.</p>
<p>Going to see domestically produced films amidst the cries of national crisis is promoting domestic goods. Saying it's promoting national essence in the old theater. Saying at the amusement park, "Entertainment does not forget patriotism. Patriotism does not forget entertainment."</p>
<p>This summer, the cat's litter is again said to be so. Your mother is still healthy and over eighty years old. Seeing her frown and say, "What an ominous thing, repeatedly!" Those who heard it didn't understand why. When you fell ill in Shanghai, the doctors were helpless. The family secretly didn't tell her. Your mother said, "Chao'er is probably incurable. He won't be able to come back. I already knew it. Are you still trying to hide it from me?" At that time, he was already critically ill, and not long after, he passed away. Alas, is this what is called the incomprehensible principle and inexplicable event? Such a strange thing!</p>
<h3>Going to War</h3>
<p>— A Member of the Qingnian Aid-Horse Corps</p>
<p>Six (Leaving Suzhou)</p>
<p>Time passes like clouds and water, quickly. Unknowingly, it has been six days since we left Shanghai. In these six days, we haven't felt any hardship. We only regret not being able to immediately rush to the front and drink our fill of the blood of the Japanese devils as if it were fine wine.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the thirteenth, our entire group traveled by car to Wuxi. Needless to say, the welcome from our compatriots was no less grand than in Suzhou. That night, we stayed overnight in the railway depot.</p>
<p>The next morning, the Jiangsu Education College, various elementary and middle schools, and other organizations, totaling about ten thousand people, held a welcoming and send-off rally in the park. We were deeply grateful for the speeches and exhortations from representatives from all walks of life. At the time, twelve young students requested to join, with utmost sincerity, cutting their fingers and swearing an oath. We couldn't bear to refuse. After the meeting, we paraded around the city streets for a week before heading to the station to board the train and advance.</p>
<p>Wuxi has the most factories in the country. When the train was still far from the station, we could already see the straight chimneys standing tall. What was particularly gratifying was that each chimney was emitting continuous black smoke. From this, we can infer the general state of Wuxi's commercial development. This made me think of the Japanese imperialists' chimneys in Shanghai. Weren't they just like Wuxi? We can also imagine the extent to which our country's commerce has been invaded by the Japanese pirates. Now that Japanese merchants have, after our unanimous economic severance, gradually stopped emitting smoke from their chimneys, we can be quite gratified. However, we still hope that our compatriots in the rear will not only have a five-minute burst of enthusiasm.</p>
<h3>The Gospel of Washing Away National Humiliation</h3>
<p>— Tianxu Wosheng</p>
<p>Yesterday, I saw a paper sample from a certain paper company, which claimed to be specially prepared for the Bank of China to completely switch to using Chinese paper for all its paper needs. The paper in the sample was all Chinese paper pasted and mounted, and treated with alum water to prevent ink from spreading when using fountain pens with foreign ink. In fact, the problem of ink spreading does not lie in the paper but in the ink. Since suffering from writer's cramp, I have used a fountain pen to write. The ink I used to use was Carter's ink. After setting up a paper mill, I decided to abandon foreign ink and make my own ink, which can be used with both fountain pens and brushes (named "Xu-made Ink"). Moreover, it is cheaper than using foreign ink in five ways: (1) Just soak a small piece of sponge in the inkwell, and you can use a fountain pen or brush to write on any Chinese paper without spreading. But the new nib must be heated with a match when used for the first time, and it will then permanently receive ink and prevent rust. (2) Foreign ink does not dry easily, so you must write horizontally from left to right to avoid smudging. This ink dries as you write and does not require blotting paper. (3) Foreign ink can be removed with chemicals, but this ink cannot be removed by any chemical, so it is most suitable for bookkeeping. (4) Foreign ink only has blue-black color and not the deep black of Chinese ink. This ink is exactly the same as freshly ground Chinese ink. If writing large pieces, it can save the trouble of grinding ink. (5) Foreign paper account books are extremely expensive because fountain pens are used, and ink does not bleed through to the other side, so thick foreign-bound paper must be used. Now, this is no longer a problem. Any kind of Chinese paper can be used. In addition to the above, there is another strange thing: if you use this ink to write with a fountain pen on Dongyang Lian Shi paper, which is made from Japanese wood pulp and masquerades as Chinese paper, it will still spread. Therefore, I believe that this kind of natural anti-Japanese weapon is enough to defeat all aggressive weapons and allow everyone to declare restoration and wash away national humiliation on their writing desks, creating a new revolutionary era. As for check paper, it can also be reprinted using Lian paper, to arouse users' patriotic spirit. From now on, there is no need to use foreign paper for any writing paper, which is quite satisfactory. The same goes for stationery, envelopes, official documents, and lecture notes. Therefore, I recognize it as a gospel and report it to readers. (Gratitude)</p>
<h3>Mr. Gao Shanshan Returns from Europe and America to Talk About National Crisis (6)</h3>
<p>— Jiping</p>
<p>From now on, if our government can wake up in time, it should pay attention to international propaganda work, permanent work, and reward the staff of embassies and consulates abroad for doing international propaganda in their private capacity. Select students studying abroad who can write articles and give speeches to specialize in this work. This kind of thing requires time and energy, and the government should give appropriate compensation. Domestic Western-language magazines, such as the China Critic Weekly, the National Weekly, and the Millard Review, are all excellent international propaganda tools. The government should make full use of them. Usually, these publications should be instructed to write more propaganda articles and be given sufficient subsidies so that they can be widely distributed in various countries to attract the attention of people from all countries. Two months ago, the China Critic Weekly published the full text of the Tanaka Memorial. After publication, the company distributed it to various countries. I also bought some copies and mailed them to foreign newspapers and government agencies. According to a Reuters report from Tokyo published in Shen Bao in mid-November, the Japanese were greatly shocked when they heard that the Tanaka Memorial had reached European countries and falsely claimed that it was fabricated by the Chinese. Furthermore, Reuters from Soviet Russia, London, and New York reported that the newspapers in those places published the Memorial on the same day and were able to attract a lot of attention from the public. The London Morning Post wired the China Critic Weekly to ask about the source of the Memorial and remitted some money to cover the cost of replying. It can be seen that this small amount of propaganda work has been able to attract the attention of various countries. We are therefore working harder. More than ten days ago, we printed hundreds of copies of the speech by Professor Yokota Kisaburo of Tokyo Imperial University (which stated that Japan's dispatch of troops to the Northeast was against public reason) into a booklet. In addition to distributing it to foreign newspapers, magazines, agencies, and important figures, we also had our representatives forward dozens of copies to important figures in the League of Nations, hoping that this work could take effect soon. In short, the national affairs have reached this point, and we don't need to be discouraged or cry. As long as we endure the extraordinary humiliation and make efforts in effective areas, even a fraction of an achievement is a benefit. In this way, there may be hope of losing in the east and gaining in the west.</p>

<h3>Sharing the Enemy With You (20)</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 5: Bloodshed on the Battlefield</p>
<p>After a long battle, Zhongshu saw that his troops were suffering increasing casualties and that the enemy cavalry had broken through his position. He urgently ordered a retreat, gradually withdrawing. The Japanese troops were overjoyed. They also thought that the Chinese troops were not strong enough to fight, so they became even more contemptuous and recklessly pursued them together. Unexpectedly, when they chased to the front of Yejigang, three cannons suddenly fired in quick succession from the opposite side, hitting the Japanese cavalry team directly, killing many people and horses. Kamekichi Jusanro knew that the enemy had reinforcements and ordered the artillery to return fire. For a time, black smoke obscured the sky, and the artillery fire shook the earth. Zhongshu's troops also launched a counterattack at the same time, charging forward with hand grenades. Gunshots rang out everywhere nearby. Kamekichi Jusanro knew that he had fallen into a trap and did not know how many enemies were lying in ambush. He had to order a retreat. Zhongshu commanded his troops to press forward step by step. The Japanese troops retreated halfway, just about to choose a place to defend, when Hua Naiqiang suddenly led his cavalry to attack from the side. The men were strong and the team was large, with everyone fighting as if they were ten men. The Japanese troops were caught off guard and collapsed in defeat. Hua Naiqiang rode a tall white horse, holding a pistol in one hand and waving a sword in the other, leading the charge, brave and fearless. He stirred up the courage of his subordinates, who all worked hard to kill the enemy. The Japanese troops had always been contemptuous of the enemy and did not expect to meet such a strong enemy today. They were defeated and returned. Hua Naiqiang gathered his troops. More than a hundred people died, and dozens were injured. They captured an armored vehicle, two heavy cannons, and hundreds of rifles. They annihilated many enemies, and corpses littered the fields. This battle was a complete victory, enough to chill the enemy's courage. Hua Naiqiang and Zhongshu were overjoyed. They discussed taking advantage of the victory to retake City T and ordered the entire army to set off immediately. Kamekichi Jusanro fled into City T. Upon learning that the Chinese troops were following closely, he hurriedly ordered his subordinates to defend the city walls, deploy electric fences around the perimeter, and set up cannons to resist the enemy with all their might. At the same time, he sent a telegram to City S requesting reinforcements. Hua Naiqiang attacked for a day and a night, but could not get close to the city because the Japanese troops' firepower was too fierce. However, the people in the city couldn't wait for the Japanese troops to fail and gradually became eager to try. The detestable Japanese troops' large reinforcements of more than three thousand people arrived the next morning, with three armored vehicles and seven or eight aircraft. They divided into two routes to surround Hua Naiqiang's army. The aircraft supported the battle in the air, constantly dropping heavy bombs. It was truly a rain of bombs and smoke, with horses falling and people collapsing. The two armies fought fiercely for a day. By night, Hua Naiqiang saw that his troops had suffered many casualties and that the defense line had been broken through. If he did not retreat, he would be surrounded by the enemy and unable to escape. Helpless, he sighed and ordered the troops to retreat. At this time, Kamekichi Jusanro had also led his cavalry out of the city. Seeing Hua Naiqiang's army retreating, he feared that he would fall into a trap again and stopped the Japanese troops from pursuing them recklessly. As a result, Hua Naiqiang's army was able to retreat safely. They retreated to Yejigang and saw that the enemy was not pursuing them, so he ordered them to temporarily station there. He counted the troops and found that there were many casualties, totaling less than three thousand people. Zhongshu said to Hua Naiqiang, "I see that the Japanese troops have reinforcements. City T will be difficult to retake for a while. We should defend the strategic location and plan a counterattack."</p>

<h3>The Waning Strength of the Call Loan Market</h3>
<p>Market Overview: As the end of the year approaches, the need for silver and foreign currency intensifies, naturally causing them to stabilize at a relatively even level. Given the current state of panic, the significant impact on finance is self-evident. However, achieving a level and balanced state may be beyond human control. Therefore, concerns about tight money are not unexpected. As for whether any crucial events will occur in the future, it's uncertain. Considering the present situation, silver and money businesses harbor immense anxiety. Thus, it's difficult to predict any stability in the call loan market.</p>
<p>Call Loan Rates (Foreign Currency Loans): The early morning call loan rate was 7 qian, 2 fen, 3 li. The afternoon rate was 7 qian, 2 fen, 3 li, 2 hao and a half, a decrease of 0.00375 compared to the previous day. The afternoon situation was slightly more stable. (Silver Loans): The early morning rate suddenly rose to 4 qian. The afternoon rate decreased slightly by 0.02, to 3 qian, 8 fen, the same as the previous day's market.

Subsidiary Currency Market: The price of Jiangsu small silver dollars increased with the Guangzhou coins, with the early morning rate at 6 qian, 5 fen, 1 li. The afternoon rate was 6 qian, 5 fen, 1 li. The volume of transactions was 13,000 coins in the early morning and 10,000 coins in the afternoon. The price of Guangdong small silver dollars was 6 qian, 5 fen, 7 li in the early morning and 6 qian, 5 fen, 7.5 li in the afternoon. The volume of transactions was 260,000 in the early morning and 150,000 in the afternoon. Copper coins suddenly decreased by 6,000 wen, to 365,000 wen. Clothing tokens decreased significantly by several tens of wen, to only 2,630 to 2,640 wen.</p>
<p>Silver and Foreign Currency Inflow and Outflow (Silver): Yesterday, banks received remittances. Chinese banks received remittances worth over 1.7 million, foreign banks received remittances worth over 1.89 million, and settlement remittances amounted to over 3 million. Various goods, exchange taxes, and miscellaneous remittances amounted to 7.78 million. 600,000 went into storage and 800,000 went out of storage. Silver shops and public guilds received over 4.1 million in remittances, and head office remittances amounted to over 320,000. Remittances from various routes amounted to over 500,000, and cash remittances amounted to 300,000 to 400,000. (Foreign Currency): The early market for rising exchange rates and draft remittances was 1.155 million, and the afternoon market was 840,000.

<p>Securities</p>
<h3>Bond Prices Continue to Decline</h3>
<p>Falling Further by About One Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 22nd), the trading activity in various bond markets on the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange saw increased activity, with brisk transactions both before and after the market session. A wide variety of spot transactions occurred, and trading was not dull. Regarding changes in the market prices of various bonds, the aggressive attitude of the Japanese, their continued advance, and open preparations for war have led to increasingly precarious Sino-Japanese relations, leaving market sentiment unchanged. Moreover, the imminent arrival of the December futures settlement and the end of the lunar year have tightened money supply in the market. Financial institutions are generally cautious, and investors are very hesitant, with few large-scale purchases. However, due to adverse factors, sellers are eager to sell, leading to a prevailing bearish sentiment in the market. The trend is chaotic, with price fluctuations depending solely on the temporary supply and demand conditions. For instance, although prices generally declined in the afternoon session, some bonds showed significant gains compared to the morning. As a result, the current month contracts for the 20th year consolidated bond and salt bonds, as well as the next month contract for the reorganization bond, each fell by over two yuan. Other bonds fell by around one yuan, while the 96th year customs bonds, reorganization bonds, and the current month contract for the 1919 charity bond experienced only minor declines. Only the current month contract for the consolidated 6% bond showed a rise. If there are no major changes in adverse conditions, the bond market is unlikely to see significant fluctuations for the rest of the year, it was said. Statistics show that spot transactions for the entire day amounted to 24,000 yuan, with futures transactions reaching 3 million in the morning and nearly 4 million in the afternoon, for a total of 6.98 million yuan.</p>

<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Market Trend Declining</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market is very weak, with an extremely weak trend. This is due to the increasingly serious national affairs, the tense atmosphere of the Jinzhou war, which has led to nervous sentiment and tight money supply. Therefore, most people consistently expect prices to fall. However, the base holdings have not been seen to be dense, and bulls are holding tight, resulting in a stalemate in the market. Actual sales of Sichuan yarn continue uninterrupted, it is said.</p>
<p>Minor Drop in Human Label: The opening of the Human Label market saw declining US cotton and poor news on current affairs. However, trading was very weak, with a very desolate market. Each month fell by 0.012. The afternoon remained weak, with each month falling by 0.012. The total daily transaction volume was 4,700 bales. Xian Chu sold 250 bales, Yi Chang 500 bales, and Chang Feng 300 bales. Heng Yi bought 600 bales, Tai Xing 600 bales, and Shen Chang 250 bales. The closing prices are listed below.</p>
<p>Human Label Closing Price, Rise and Fall, Inventory</p>
<p>February 15.28 Down 0.012 50,503</p>
<p>March 15.34 Down 0.01 64,700</p>
<p>January 15.23 52,805</p>
<p>April 15.36 51,302</p>
<p>February 15.25 63,103</p>
<p>May 15.37 32,202</p>
<p>Customer Sales of 1,500 Bales: The sales of spot yarn are still good. It is estimated that various banks bought a total of 1,500 bales throughout the day. 100 bales were taken in by colleagues. The market is trending downward. Among the customer banks, Sichuan took in 1,200 bales, Shantou 110 bales, the interior 55 bales, and miscellaneous banks 70 bales, it was said.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Mediocre</h3>
<p>The cotton market is slightly soft, with a very dim outlook. Due to the poor environment and extremely tight finances, actual demand is weak. All factories have absorbed their fill of foreign cotton, and local cotton has no room for purchase. Therefore, the situation is very weak. However, general non-industry players and the Han Ning bank, due to their large base positions and difficulty in reducing gold prices, are holding tight. Therefore, the market sentiment has become neither rising nor falling.</p>
<p>Minor Drop in Chinese Label: The opening of the Chinese Label market saw a very flat market. Due to declining US cotton, each month fell slightly by 0.005 to 0.01. The afternoon fell another 0.005. The total daily transaction volume was 13,100 dan. Heng De sold 4,200 dan, Geng Feng 800 dan, and Shen Chang 800 dan. Heng Da bought 1,000 dan, Chang He over 1,200, Tong Xing 1,300 dan, and Xin Cheng 4,200 dan. The closing prices are listed below.</p>
<p>Chinese Label Closing Price, Rise and Fall, Inventory</p>

<p>February 31.85 85,010 May 32.40 87,800</p>
<p>Spot Transactions Still Bleak: Spot cotton transactions are still bleak. The source is estimated to be 100 bales of Yao cotton and 500 bales of Tong cotton, it was said.</p>
<p>Yancheng Cotton 3.175 Chong Xin 200 bales of spot goods delivered to the factory</p>
<h3>Prediction of Total Indian Cotton Fields and Cotton Harvest</h3>
<p>A telegram from Calcutta on the 21st stated that the third estimate of total Indian cotton fields and cotton harvest was released today as follows (units in thousands):</p>

<p>Same period in 1926 15,542,000 bales</p>
<h3>Foreign Cotton Down Across the Board</h3>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton prices were weak due to a lack of major buyers and the liquidation of long positions in the South. Futures fell by 8 to 12 points and spot prices fell by 10 points. British cotton futures fell and spot prices fell by 5 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 15 points. The Indian cotton market was quiet and firm, with Pingguoer unchanged, Aomula down 7.75 rupees, and Bairoxi down 0.5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram of the 21st):</p>
<p>US Cotton Compared to Previous Day Combined Shanghai Standard British Cotton Compared to Previous Day Combined Shanghai Standard</p>

<h3>Grain and River Rice Increasingly Stagnant</h3>
<p>Two Heads: The source of supply was still surging yesterday, with about seventy or eighty ships loaded with goods in the Huangpu River. The local market had little appetite because the weather was clear and sunny. There was an extreme shortage of rice hulls from the river, with less than 1,000 stones. Goods from Suzhou, Tongzhou, and the northern market were continuously arriving, causing prices to fall by 1 jiao each. Except for a small drop in rice, Foreign Du and Tip rice experienced no change, and Bianyin Yuangfeng Shop bought 600 stones of Hongzhao at the original price.</p>
<p>New Gate: Not many arrived yesterday. The rice hulls from the river showed no improvement. There was little trading in the early morning at the shops. The price of thick, new japonica rice fell by about 1 jiao. There was still a lot of early thin rice arriving, and the price fell by 2 jiao. Not much Foreign Du and Tip rice were purchased in this city, but the outside ports and Yueer banks were purchasing, so the price trended tighter.</p>
<h3>Northern Banks Continue to Handle Small Polished Rice</h3>
<p>Suzhou and Gengdi Rice Have Transactions</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market was still stable. After the Hankou Bank stopped trading yesterday, the Northern Banks showed interest, and the local market still had an active appetite, so the market remained stable. The Northern Banks continued to handle 500 bags of small polished rice. If this batch is profitable after it leaves, there will be continued transactions. The market opened with 1,000 bags of small polished rice, priced at 9.4 yuan to 9.27 yuan. 500 bags of Saigon No. 1, priced at 11.25 yuan to 11 yuan. In addition to foreign rice, the Northern Banks also took more than 200 bags of Gan Yuan rice, priced at 13.7 yuan to 13.45 yuan. This market also took 500 bags of Taizhou rice, priced at 10 yuan to 9.4 yuan. Futures recovered a little. There was a new transaction of 1,000 tons of small polished rice for February, at the same price as the previous market. Xiang Mao sold 1,000 tons of Yangon long tip rice (i.e., Suzhou Gengdi rice) for February, priced at 4 taels and 8 qian and a half. This rice has not arrived in port for a long time, and this is the first new transaction, it was said.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market Near Firm, Far Soft</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market generally showed a meandering trend. The near-term months had a slightly better market because the buyers were still strong. The far-term months, due to the falling price of foreign wheat and the continuing orders from factories, although the market value was low, sentiment could not be tightened. However, the settlement is near, and it should be calm for a while. As a result, January and February were better by 1 fen compared to the previous day, March was down by 1 fen, April was down by 2 fen, and May was down by 1 fen, it was said.</p>
<p>It is heard that about 4,000 cars of wheat will be delivered this month. It is heard that those who are prepared to receive the goods are Zhi Cheng Yong, who will take more than 30 cars, and Ren Cheng, who will receive 8 cars, it was said.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Returns to Weakness</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market generally showed a flat and weak trend. The price of foreign wheat fell by about 0.02 or 0.03 yuan, and the end of the Gregorian year was not far away. Some inland banks were returning their positions. Due to the river closure and the Japanese army's rampage, the actual procurement of goods by the northern sales banks has been reduced. Therefore, near and far-term prices have returned to weakness. However, the large factories have all settled their chips, and only the medium and small factories still have goods to cover. Therefore, there may be no major surprises in the future market. As a result, the current month fell by 0.00125, January fell by 0.0015, February fell by 0.0005, March fell by 0.00125, April fell by 0.001, and May fell by 0.0015, it was said.</p>
<p>North and South Goods</p>
<h3>Southern Gorgon Nut Market Prices Exceedingly High</h3>
<p>This year, the production of gorgon nuts from Nantang is scarce, and both arrivals and inventories are lacking. The market price is rising higher and higher. Yesterday, the high price reached 190 yuan, and the secondary price was 185 yuan. If it lasts until next spring, it may even reach more than 200 yuan. Pond gorgon nuts have also risen recently, and are currently selling for 37 or 38 taels, which is very stable. The market is unlikely to turn loose in the future, it was said.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: European and American Silk Sales Deteriorating</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market for foreign firms in this port was deteriorating. It was found that the prices of Chinese silk in European and American markets have plummeted, and no one is inquiring. There has been no improvement in silk dispatches to Shanghai. The future of the silk market is becoming increasingly hopeless. Yesterday, only Gao Bei and others imported five bags of white dried silk, and Ke Chang imported three bags of yellow coarse silk. Prices are still flat and weak, it was said.</p>
<h3>Lyon White Factory Silk Plummets</h3>
<p>Each Kilogram Drops 10 to 20 Francs</p>
<p>The Lyon raw silk market has recently been affected by the low-priced intrusion of Japanese silk. In addition, the economy is increasingly showing signs of panic, and no one is inquiring about Chinese silk. Silk prices have plummeted, especially Shanghai white factory silk. It is estimated that A-grade wire is only opening at 135 francs per kilogram, B-grade at 120 francs, and C-grade at 108 francs, each down 10 to 20 francs compared to the beginning of last week, it was said.</p>
<h3>Five Metals: Over 300 Dan of Electrolytic Copper Opened</h3>
<p>Transactions in electrolytic copper have been quiet for a long time, so there have been no reports in the market for many days. However, yesterday, Nanjing suddenly sent a telegram commissioning 350 dan. The opening price was 38 taels per dan, which seemed to be a slight decrease of 0.005 yuan compared to the previous time. However, investigations showed that inventories were still full, so the trend is likely to continue to soften, it was said.</p>
<h3>Black Iron Sheet Starts to Stir</h3>
<p>After the last frenzy of purchases by the Tianjin bank, the market for black iron sheet once developed. Afterwards, the market became deserted due to quiet purchases, and trading has been bleak. In recent days, there have been signs of movement in transactions. The purchasers are the Qing, Tianjin, and Henan banks. However, the local buyers are still not showing signs of improvement, it was said.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous News: 3,750 bales of US cotton will be imported tomorrow.</p>

<h3>Movements of Important National Figures</h3>
<p>Chiang Kai-shek Returns to Ningbo: Central Committee member Chiang Kai-shek, after resigning from his concurrent positions as Chairman of the National Government, intended</p>
<h3>Jiang Zuobin Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Embassy Affairs Temporarily Handled by Jiang Huaben</p>
<p>Japan's Diplomatic Policy Remains Fully Consistent</p>
<p>To Go to Beijing This Morning to Attend the First Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee</p>
<p>Mr. Jiang Zuobin, the ambassador to Japan, arrived in Shanghai yesterday at 11:00 AM aboard the Japanese Empress ship. The ship docked at the Pudong Wharf. Zhao Tiezhang, section chief of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai office, personally greeted Mr. Jiang upon landing. Afterward, he went directly to his private residence on Route Lafayette for a rest. Our reporter interviewed Mr. Jiang at his residence yesterday. According to Mr. Jiang, he came to attend the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee. He was accompanied by a secretary from the embassy. Embassy affairs are currently being handled by Jiang Huaben. Since the establishment of the new cabinet in Japan, its diplomatic policy has remained fully consistent and has not changed. Regarding the Northeast Incident, it may even be intensified. Many overseas Chinese in Japan are engaged in small businesses and are suffering from various forms of intangible oppression, resulting in many closures. However, those forced to return to China account for only 20-30% of the total. As for students, most of those studying at their own expense have returned to China, while those on government scholarships are continuing their studies. Mr. Jiang also stated that the Seiyukai party holds an absolute majority in the Japanese parliament, and the Minseito party is no match for it. However, the new cabinet is determined and will ultimately resort to dissolution. When the reporter inquired about the truth of the rumor that the ambassador to Japan would be replaced, Mr. Jiang replied that his previous trip to Japan was at the urging of various parties, so he had no choice but to reluctantly accept the position. If the central government can appoint someone else, he would be very happy to relinquish his responsibilities. It is heard that Mr. Jiang is scheduled to take the early train to Beijing this morning to attend the First Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee.</p>
<p>National Crisis Relief Association</p>
<h3>Telegram Urges Mobilization for Self-Defense</h3>
<p>The National Crisis Relief Association of the Republic of China telegraphed the National Government, saying: To the National Government in Nanjing, considering the brutal Japanese invasion of Jinzhou, if we do not resist, how can we establish ourselves as a nation? Please mobilize immediately and strive for self-defense. The people pledge to be the backing. National Crisis Relief Association of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3>National Crisis Relief Association Circular Telegram</h3>
<p>The National Crisis Relief Association of the Republic of China issued a circular telegram, saying: To all the people of the country, the national crisis is imminent. Internal strife continues, and foreign aggression comes one after another. The brutal Japanese act recklessly, and the country is about to perish. The people demand unity and resistance to aggression. The authorities do not examine the crux of their inability to unify and resist aggression, and hastily respond, causing incidents of hostility towards party headquarters in Nanjing, Hangzhou, Shanghai, Beiping, Taiyuan, and other places. The so-called foundation of the party, built on the people, has been fundamentally shaken. Tracing the cause, it is not entirely due to one-party dictatorship. Now that the government is reorganized, the people's support depends on this crucial moment. The only way is to immediately lift the party rule and proceed with constitutionalism to establish a fundamental plan for a hundred years. Regarding the urgent demands of the people at present, the government's minimum expression must be to promptly prohibit party headquarters at all levels from oppressing the people and interfering in administration, and to guarantee the people's freedom of association, assembly, and all other freedoms. It is absolutely inappropriate to resume the name of tutelage government and the reality of dictatorship. This is the first point that should be unanimously advocated. Our country's provinces have been implementing autonomy for many years. Since the establishment of party headquarters in various provinces, cities, and counties, the foundation of civil governance has suddenly collapsed. The party dictatorship has no ability to form a reasonable organization for the lower-level people, but instead allows bandits to use it, so that righteous people hesitate and bandits thrive. The so-called construction is nothing more than extorting the people's wealth, establishing many names, and creating institutions. There is no record of achievement, and the expenses are only abused. Moreover, it is incomprehensible that party fees are paid by the national treasury. Now, to increase social capacity and relieve the people's suffering, the only way is to return provincial and county local powers to the people, strictly implement autonomy, and let everyone work together to resist the country's difficulties and jointly plan for construction. If we do not do this, and only want to use the false name of a national salvation conference to gather talents and reverse the fortunes of the country, how can we succeed? This is the second point that should be unanimously advocated. The slogan of revolutionary diplomacy has been resounding for several years, but most of the diplomatic envoys are vacant, and the national defense army is useless. When the national crisis suddenly arises, the authorities avoid armed resistance, rely on the League of Nations as a talisman, and watch the country perish, unable to do anything. At the beginning of the government reorganization, the people's expectations are new. How to remedy the past failures, how to equip the national defense strength, how to train the people's armed forces, and how to deal with the continuous dangers should be promptly announced by the government in concrete plans, otherwise, how can we strengthen the foundation of the country and stabilize the people's hearts? This is the third point that should be unanimously advocated. Political improvement has countless aspects, and shifting people's hearts is the key. It is necessary to place the party system within the scope of civil governance and include party members in the constraints of the rule of law, so that internal unity and external resistance to aggression can be achieved. The survival of the Republic of China depends on this. I extend public opinion and respectfully hope for your clear instruction. National Crisis Relief Association of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3>Shao Lizi Issues a Statement</h3>
<p>Mr. Shao Lizi, a member of the Central Executive Committee, came to Shanghai by train yesterday morning and returned to Beijing by train last night. The main points of his statement are summarized as follows: (1) Mr. Shao came to Shanghai specifically to visit Mr. Wang Jingwei. According to him, Mr. Wang's condition is generally as reported in yesterday's newspaper, but he is still very concerned about the plenary session. He promised that in two or three days, if his fever subsides slightly, he will go to Beijing despite his illness. Mr. Shao's visit to Mr. Wang was permitted by the doctor and was brief, in strict accordance with the doctor's instructions. (2) Regarding being appointed to guide party affairs in Shanghai, Mr. Shao said that because the Central Executive Committee is holding a plenary session, Committee Members Chen and Wu, as well as Shao, have not been able to come to Shanghai. However, Shao himself feels that his talent and ability are insufficient, and he has never actually participated in party affairs before. He is determined to resign from this task to the Central Executive Committee after the plenary session. (3) Regarding the appointment of the chairman of the Gansu Provincial Government, Mr. Shao said that he still intends to firmly decline. The reports that he has agreed to take office are not accurate. Shao feels that his talent and experience are not sufficient for the heavy responsibility of the chairmanship, especially in dealing with personnel matters. However, it is not because he dislikes Gansu's remoteness and barrenness. Therefore, he said that if the Central Executive Committee relieves him of his chairmanship, he would like to go to Gansu as an idle person. (4) Regarding the farewell event for students of the China Public School, Shao said that he never wanted to be the principal of the school and repeatedly declined. The fact that he rarely went to the school is also true. However, he had obtained the permission of the board of directors in advance, and the vice principal was responsible for the school affairs. Vice Principal Pan and others sincerely ran the school, and Shao feels very sorry for this result, but is also fortunate to be relieved of the school affairs. Shao recently received a telegram of resignation from Vice Principal Pan and immediately forwarded it to the board of directors, requesting to resign together. He hopes that the board of directors can hold a meeting as soon as possible to elect other capable people. (5) Mr. Shao heard from a friend yesterday that a small newspaper in Shanghai called (New Continent) reported that Shao advocated using machine guns to deal with students. Shao was very grieved and said that he had never made such remarks and that they were completely contrary to his usual advocacy. He does not understand where such fabricated rumors come from, nor does he understand the intention of the rumor-mongers.</p>
<h3>National Salvation Association Telegram to Lin and Chen</h3>
<p>The National Salvation Association of the Republic of China telegraphed Chairman Lin and Premier Chen of the National Government in Nanjing, saying: To Chairman Lin of the National Government and Premier Chen of the Executive Yuan, after reading your telegram, we are extremely pleased. You, sir, are a model for the masses and a pillar in times of crisis. Taking on the heavy responsibility of this crisis, pacifying the country and resisting foreign aggression, the whole people are looking forward to it. However, the brutal Japanese are fierce and have not stopped increasing their troops. The people are indignant, and the country is restless. At this time, when a unified government has not yet been formed and internal and external measures are related to survival, we should publish our policies to dispel public doubts and comfort expectations. In addition to sending representatives to request instructions in person, we hereby telegraph our views. The National Salvation Association of the Republic of China respectfully bows.</p>
<h3>Various Circles in Shanghai Retain Mayor Zhang</h3>
<p>And Congratulate Commander Xiong on His Promotion</p>
<p>Yesterday, the municipal business, commercial, and academic circles of Shanghai telegraphed the Executive Yuan of the National Government to retain Mayor Zhang, and telegraphed to congratulate Commander Xiong on his appointment as Chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial Government. The two telegrams are as follows:</p>
<p>Telegram to the National Government: To Chairman Lin of the National Government and Premier Chen of the Executive Yuan, we have recently heard that Mayor Zhang of this city has suddenly telegraphed the central government, requesting to resign. We are extremely dismayed to hear this news. Since Mayor Zhang took office, he has been able to appease the people and win their support. At this time of foreign aggression and domestic uncertainty, he suddenly wants to retire, which does not seem to be the right time. Moreover, this city is a place where Chinese and foreigners intertwine, and it is related to the observation of China and foreign countries. It is especially important to have a capable person to govern it. We dare to telegraph to the Executive Yuan, asking the government to prioritize the local area and quickly order him to cancel his resignation. Don't let him retire.

<h3>Yan Zhaozhen and Others Host a Banquet for Guangdong Central Executive Committee Members</h3>
<p>Jiao Yitang Talks About the Essentials of National Salvation</p>
<p>Yan Zhaozhen, Duan Youjun, Wang Yanghao, and others hosted a banquet at the Atlantic Restaurant at 6:00 PM the night before last for Guangdong Central Executive Committee members Chen Zhongfu and Jiao Yitang, as well as more than thirty guests. Yan Zhaozhen first delivered a speech, saying that all past disputes in the country were due to the dispersion of revolutionary forces and the lack of unity among the people. Now, the comrades in Nanjing and Guangdong will eliminate all past mistakes and prejudices and unite to jointly seek strategies for national salvation to cope with the national crisis. Then, not only can China's fate be turned from danger to safety, but also the suffering of the people can be gradually relieved. Then, Central Executive Committee member Jiao Yitang replied, saying that national salvation requires unity first. Only with unity can we talk about autonomy, and only with autonomy can we seek self-preservation. At this time of serious diplomatic crisis, the people should rise up together to save the country and unite against foreign aggression. At about 9:00 PM, the hosts and guests dispersed happily.</p>
<p>Initiation</p>
<h3>Meeting of Holders of Domestic Public Debt Treasury Bonds</h3>
<p>It is rumored that a certain Central Executive Committee member has proposed to the central government to earnestly consult with the financial community, considering the central government's financial difficulties and maintaining the credit of public debt, and to find ways to extend the payment of a portion of the principal and interest of public debt. The general public in Shanghai who hold public debt treasury bonds are extremely panicked. Hundreds of people, including Qi Huiji, Xu Yuji, Hu Qiuji, and Hu Laiji, have initiated the organization of the (Republic of China Domestic Public Debt Treasury Bond Holders Association) and are actively preparing. A declaration will be issued in the coming days, and claims will be made to the government. An announcement will be made in the newspaper to notify all bondholders to participate and proceed together.</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Federation</p>
<h3>Declaration on National Financial Issues</h3>
<p>If the Central Government Delays the Payment of Principal and Interest on Public Debt</p>
<p>Banknotes Will Become Irredeemable Paper Money</p>
<p>Financial Institutions Will Inevitably Shut Down</p>
<p>Guowen News Agency reported that the National Chamber of Commerce Federation of the Republic of China issued a declaration yesterday on national financial issues, saying: "It is found that at the end of the Qing Dynasty, the national public debt was only about 400 million yuan, and the people already believed that there was a risk of bankruptcy. The budget of the third year of Xuantong was returned to the government by the Zizhengyuan because the income and expenditure could not be offset, ordering it to be recompiled. The loan for the Sichuan-Hankou Railway was 10 million pounds in British currency, equivalent to 100 million yuan in national currency at that time. The people all ran around telling each other, horrified that it was a loan that would lead to the demise of the country, triggering a storm and causing a revolution. The collapse of the Qing Dynasty was due to political darkness, cowardly military officials, money-loving civil officials, going against the will of the people, and obstructing constitutionalism. What hastened its demise was the lack of transparency in finance and the lack of establishment of national credit. When the Republic of China was established, the people all celebrated with joy, thinking that from then on, politics would become increasingly clear and finance would make daily progress. Unexpectedly, because of a 5 million yuan loan from Belgium, Premier Tang fled to Tianjin, and the cabinet collapsed. Following this, a 250 million yuan loan for reconstruction was issued. Public debt and foreign loans were not possible publicly, so they were followed by private deals, which eventually led the Beijing government to its demise, struggling to make ends meet. Such a government was bound to collapse sooner or later. The Chinese Kuomintang rose, calling itself the representative of the people's interests and aiming to relieve the people's suffering. Its ideology was the Three Principles of the People, and its method was construction. At that time, the people looked forward to it like the years, hoping that the Soviet Union could be expected. Therefore, the Northern Expeditionary Army advanced with irresistible force, and the people all welcomed the party army with food and drink. The reason why it gained the sympathy of the people was that the people had been suffering from harsh government for a long time and hoped for financial liberation so that they could live and work in peace. What else could they seek besides the livelihood of the people? Unexpectedly, after the completion of the Northern Expedition and the realization of unification, the comrades immediately took up arms against each other. The east, west, north, and south fought in chaos for several years. There was no construction, and destruction followed. They only sought military victory and disregarded the failure of the government, let alone the bankruptcy of finance. They imposed excessive taxes and miscellaneous levies. Public debt treasury bonds were issued in the tens of thousands, so that in a short period of four or five years, the people bore more than one billion yuan, and the newly added huge taxes were not included. With such a financial situation, even without the floods in sixteen or seventeen provinces, the red land of Shaanxi, Gansu, and Henan, and the brutal Japanese invasion of the Northeast, it would have been enough to make the government unable to raise funds and the people unable to live. The Ningbo-Guangdong conference and the reunification of the party have been determined. The Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee was held in the capital, next to Sun Yat-sen's mausoleum on Zijin Mountain. All the supervisors and members will be able to repent of each other and make up for the mistakes of each country. Although politics has a myriad of things to be managed, the financial plan that most affects the life and death of the people must have a practical plan to establish national credit and stabilize the people's hearts. How can we imagine that news has come that there is a proposal that will make the people unable to sleep or eat, that is, to (ask the central government to earnestly consult with the financial community, considering the central government's financial difficulties and the scope of maintaining public debt credit, and to find ways to extend the payment of a portion of the principal and interest of public debt), rashly proposed, and there are even important people who have long held the party and national plan who are happy to support the rumors. It is appropriate that bond prices have fallen sharply, and people's hearts are panicked to the extreme. The national politics under party rule, calmly thinking about its achievements, there are countless things that are enough to disturb the people's hearts. The facts are there, and hundreds of mouths cannot argue. What is more or less satisfactory is that the repayment of principal and interest on public debt treasury bonds can still be made on time, and the management of the fund can still be independent and held in the hands of the people. Therefore, in the past four or five years, although public debt treasury bonds have reached saturation and are on the path of expansion, the real bondholders are still sufficient to be used as the necessary expenses for life and as a means of financial flexibility. If any country does not have even this basic credit of repaying principal and interest, how can it be ranked among the nations of the world? If even this basic credit is lacking, the collapse of the government can be expected. The proposer believes that extending the repayment of principal and interest can be discussed with the financial community. Alas, how wrong and ignorant is that! The holders of public debt treasury bonds are not the financial community, but the vast majority of merchants and middle-class people who rely on interest income for their livelihood. Even if the financial community holds public debt and treasury bonds because of pledging loans as guarantees and issuing banks as guarantee reserves, regardless of the amount, their interests are completely related to the general public. Although this kind of public debt is in the vaults of the financial community, it has actually become banknotes and entered the hands of the general public. Once the payment of principal and interest is stopped, the effect of the bonds is fundamentally lost. Those who rely on interest to live will of course have nothing to live on, and merchants who rely on it to finance capital will of course have nothing to trade. Following this, industry, agriculture, and general businesses will all be unable to proceed. Not only that, but the four-tenths of the guarantee reserve of the issuing bank is prepared with bonds. If the bonds cannot circulate in the market, it is tantamount to promoting banknotes to become irredeemable paper money. Once this kind of fact occurs, how can banks and money shops cope? To put it bluntly, financial institutions will inevitably be unable to turn around and shut down. This is an inevitable fact, and no amount of effort can remedy it afterwards. The responsibility of this association lies in being the representative of the national economic community, and it dares not fail to express it with tears. I hope that all circles will rise up to fight for it, otherwise, under the overturned nest, how can there be a complete egg? I hereby declare this, hoping that you will all be aware of it.</p>
<p>Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce</p>
<h3>Wang Xiaolai Hosts Representatives from Various Industries</h3>
<p>Wang Expresses His Determination to Defend the Chamber of Commerce to the Death</p>
<p>Over a Hundred Industry Representatives Unanimously Deny the Business Operation Committee</p>
<p>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Chairman Wang Xiaolai, yesterday, to report on the recent dispute within the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, hosted a lunch at the Atlantic Restaurant, inviting representatives from various industry associations and store members. Attendees included representatives from banking, money exchange, shipping, bean and rice trade, woolen fabrics, factories, the woolen fabric industry, cigarette factories, securities, silk fabrics, the fishing industry, timber, coal mines, the rice trade, the book industry, insurance, Chinese medicine, the coal industry, the chicken and duck trade, new-style laundry and dyeing, noodle shops, mercerized cotton velvet, northern and southern goods, knitting, the egg trade, silverware, silk factories, new medicines, southern goods, color printing, ginseng and bird's nest, woolen fabrics, and over 170 other groups, including Bei Songsun, Xu Xinliu, Wu Yunzhai, Chen Zhezheng, Pei Yunqing, Ye Huijun, Lao Jingxiu, Gu Xinyi, Wang Binyan, Fang Jiaobo, Ma Shaoquan, Ma Jiliang, Lü Yuequan, Lu Feibohong, Sheng Tongsun, Liu Shisun, Wu Tingsheng, Yuan Lüdeng, Lu Zhengbing, Qiu Liangyu, Wu Zhihao, Fei Yunsun, Chen Liangyu, Tu Kaizheng, Chen Songyuan, Ge Jechen, Gu Jiuru, and over 250 other representatives.</p>
<p>Chairman Wang's Report Chairman Wang Xiaolai delivered a speech, saying:</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>"It is my great pleasure to have representatives from various industry associations in the city present today. In June of last year, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce was established according to law. Representatives from various industries elected Xiaolai and others as executive and supervisory committee members. We have been handling the affairs of the Chamber in accordance with the Chamber of Commerce Law, the Implementing Rules of the Chamber of Commerce Law, and the charter approved by this association, for a year and six months now. I am ashamed that we have not achieved enough to live up to the expectations of the public. However, we have always strived to be public-spirited and law-abiding, and to uphold the desire to protect commerce. Unexpectedly, on the 18th of this month, a so-called Shanghai Special Municipality Business People's Movement Committee sent personnel leading dozens of plainclothes followers to the Chamber with a letter, claiming to take over. Their momentum was fierce, almost like a robbery. Fortunately, the Chamber handled it appropriately, and with the protection of the police dispatched by the authorities, we avoided an accident. The industry representatives entrusted us with handling the affairs of the Chamber of Commerce. Today, we are still able to maintain the integrity and safety of the Chamber of Commerce and meet with the industry representatives, avoiding the crime of dereliction of duty. This is a great fortune for all the committee members, and we can report it to the industry representatives with satisfaction. Since the incident occurred, the Chamber of Commerce immediately issued an important declaration, expressing our attitude. At the same time, after deliberation by the joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees, all executive and supervisory committee members issued a joint statement based on legal facts, which has been published in newspapers one after another and should be seen by all industry representatives. However, the foundation of the Chamber of Commerce lies in the industry associations, and the actions of the Chamber of Commerce staff should be subject to the will of the industry associations. This time, 160 industry associations were able to express their rational and law-abiding demands with a swift and solemn attitude, issuing a declaration to the public, so that the methods of the Chamber of Commerce committee members in dealing with this matter could be based on the true public opinion of all the merchants in the city and become a strong expression. At the same time, the notices issued by the Business People's Movement Committee, ostensibly by various industry associations to convene meetings, have now been denied by the cotton cloth, new medicine, department stores, refining, knitting, noodle shops, ginseng and bird's nest, and Fen wine industry associations, as well as the National Goods Factory Federation, proving that justice is clear and their tricks are exhausted. For this, we cannot but thank the industry representatives. The Chamber of Commerce is a legally organized group, and the committee members are legally elected staff. What is being fought for today is only adherence to the law. This is what I dare to solemnly declare to the industry representatives on behalf of all the executive and supervisory committee members. If you are dissatisfied with the organization of the Chamber of Commerce or have any opinions about the name of the Chamber of Commerce, the only way is to request the Legislative Yuan to amend the Chamber of Commerce Law, and then convene a general meeting of members to handle it according to law. It is absolutely impossible to achieve the goal by borrowing a name, using violence, and attempting to rob. If we abandon the law and talk about people, then since Mr. Xu Jiying resigned as chairman of this association, I have been elected to succeed him and reluctantly take on the responsibility to maintain the overall situation. If I can be relieved of my burden, I would be happy to seek it through legal procedures and proper channels. Now, Article 19 of the Chamber of Commerce Law clearly stipulates that the term of office of the executive and supervisory committee members is four years, with half of them being re-elected every two years, and they cannot be re-elected. Counting to June of next year, it will be the time for the two-year re-election. If I am determined to resign, I will not be able to be re-elected and hold onto the affairs of the association according to law, which is something that cannot be done. As for the execution of the affairs of the association, a standing committee meeting is held once a week according to law, and it must be executed only after the attendance and resolution of more than three standing committee members. The more important matters must also be submitted to the executive committee for approval. Moreover, the public documents issued every day must be signed by more than three standing committee members. Individuals have no power to make decisions alone, and the responsibility is shared. No committee member can take sole credit for the affairs of the association, nor can any committee member bear sole responsibility for the affairs of the association. As for Mr. Wang Yansong, he is one of the standing committee members of this association. He has always worked hard for the commercial movement and is well known to the people of the country. In the past, he has worked tirelessly and taken on a lot of responsibility in striving for the regulations of various industries and eliminating labor disputes. This is not because I am pleasing him, but because it is fair to say a word. This is in terms of my personal issues. As for the chairman of the Business People's Movement Committee, not only have we worked together for many years, but I have also helped him resolve difficulties in the past. However, what is being fought for today is the law, and what is being fought for is fairness. I am willing to follow the industry representatives and all the committee members to defend the Chamber of Commerce to the death. Personal friendship is not what I rely on, violence cannot subdue me, and the law and justice are the final and most powerful guarantee. This is what I deeply believe. The above is the attitude and efforts of the members of this association and myself towards this case. I sincerely hope that the representatives attending today will give us their corrections and advice, so that we can follow them in the future when executing the affairs of the association. Thank you, thank you very much." The representatives present then delivered speeches, the summaries of which are as follows: (1) Wang Yansong's speech, which roughly stated that the dispute within the Chamber of Commerce had already been reported by the chairman and did not need to be repeated. However, he recently saw in the newspaper the declaration issued by the Business Movement Committee and in anonymous leaflets, there were quite a few attacks on him. He would not argue, but only said that sensational words would cause misunderstandings. Taking this opportunity, he briefly described a few things. He had been doing business in Shanghai since the tenth year of the Republic of China, when he founded the Taichang Silk Fabric Bureau. Later, he also established the Dahua, Daxin, and Damei Bureaus, which had been in operation for more than ten years. However, the declaration of the Business Movement Committee falsely accused him of only recently engaging in commerce, which was not worth laughing at. It also claimed that he operated companies and banks such as Lidajiang Zhejiang, which was even more absurd. He did not even know whether there were such companies and banks as Lidajiang Zhejiang in this city, let alone engage in operations. Furthermore, he had never participated in the Fund Management Committee or the Finance Committee of the Anti-Japanese Association in this city, nor had he ever heard of them. Later, the National Salvation Fund was investigated by personnel sent by the central government and designated as the Labor Hospital Labor Education Fund, which was also on file. As for the matter of preparing the Jisheng Yarn Factory, he did put in effort when it was first initiated, but after the factory was formally established in accordance with the Company Law and a board of directors was formed, he severed his relationship and no longer served as a consultant. All these things were facts and could not be fabricated. In short, at this time of internal and external troubles, he deeply hoped that all the merchants in the city would uphold the past spirit of love and sincerity, strengthen unity, and work hard and strive for progress. Now, the Business Movement Committee was actually taking advantage of this opportunity to cause unnecessary disputes, which was truly heartbreaking, etc. (2) Fang Jiaobo's speech roughly stated that the Chamber of Commerce could not be seized by anyone. Nowadays, the world is going downhill, justice is not upheld, and right and wrong are not judged fairly. Those of us engaged in the business movement feel truly discouraged. Since Mr. Wang Yansong took charge of the Chamber of Commerce, he has always been mindful of the welfare of all industries. Whether it was the revision of the regulations of various industries, the request to abolish harsh taxes, or the efforts to reduce the business tax, Mr. Wang has always worked and called out before us. Now he is being envied and attacked, which is truly heartbreaking. However, since we have already resolved to serve the society, we will not care about any sacrifices. He deeply hoped that all colleagues and Mr. Wang Yansong would not be discouraged by this and weaken their spirit, which is what he earnestly hoped. (3) Zhu Wenqi's speech roughly stated that the declaration of the Business Movement Committee reported this time actually involved the Jisheng Yarn Factory, which was very strange. The factory's background was that after the May 30th Tragedy in the 17th year of the Republic of China, the dyeing and weaving industries in this city and other ports planned to set up a fine yarn factory. They were struggling to raise funds, so they asked the former Shanghai Anti-Japanese Association to collect a fine yarn factory fund for each yarn line on behalf of the dyeing and weaving industries. Members were recommended by the dyeing and weaving industries to manage the fund, and personnel were sent by the former Anti-Japanese Association to supervise. By March of that year, the anti-Japanese movement stopped, and the fund could no longer be collected, totaling about 600,000 taels of silver. Later, one party legally convened an establishment meeting and elected directors and supervisors, while the other party ordered machinery and factory foundations. However, because the funds were insufficient, they advertised publicly to solicit shares, preparing to raise 1 million taels. However, after advertising for several months, there were very few respondents. The board of directors reported the difficult situation of soliciting shares to the shareholders' meeting in December of last year. After full authorization, it was decided that because new shares could not continue to be raised and there was no way to proceed, the Jisheng Yarn Factory would be declared dissolved in accordance with the company regulations. All the shares would be returned to the shareholders on schedule, and detailed accounts would be reported to each shareholder. The handling process was always in accordance with the company regulations. It was unexpected that the Business Movement Committee would involve it in the business dispute, which can be said to be exhausting the ability to fabricate, etc. Furthermore, Ma Shaoquan, Wu Zhihao, Zhang Meian, Cheng Xiechun, Chen Qisheng, Jiao Liangyu, and others successively delivered speeches, all unanimously expressing their support for the legal actions of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. They were very angry at the Business Movement Committee's borrowing violence and attempting to destroy. If the Chamber of Commerce could be seized, then the industry associations and even the stores of various industries, which are protected by law, could also be arbitrarily robbed, which would lead to what kind of situation. Therefore, various industries vowed to do their best to oppose this illegal movement, unanimously denied the illegally organized Business Movement Committee, and prayed that all the committee members of the Chamber of Commerce would continue to work hard to protect the safety of the Chamber of Commerce, which is also to protect the safety of commerce, etc.</p>
<p>Convening a Joint Meeting The Shanghai Shipbuilding, New Laundry and Dyeing, Chicken and Duck Trade, Restaurant, Noodle and Fish, Jun Boat, Oil Sesame, Shaoxing Wine, Barber, and 14 other industry associations issued a notice yesterday, saying: "All industry associations are informed that the case of the Shanghai Special Municipality Business People's Movement Committee sending Zhao Nangong and others to take over the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce on the 18th of this month has a profound and significant relationship with all industry associations in the city. Whether the Municipal Chamber of Commerce allows anyone to be taken over under any name is a very urgent issue at present. In order to solve all disputes as soon as possible, after discussion at the joint meeting of representatives of various industries such as this association, it is considered necessary to invite representatives from various industries in the city to exchange views together. It has been decided to hold a temporary talk meeting of representatives from various industry associations at 3:00 pm on Wednesday, December 23, to discuss various important matters. We must ask each of our industry associations to send responsible representatives to attend at that time, etc."</p>
<p>Denying Being Listed as a Convenor The Chicken and Duck Trade, New Laundry and Dyeing, and Noodle Shop Industry Associations issued an urgent statement yesterday, denying being listed as a convenor of a joint meeting, stating: "Reading the notice signed by the Hotel Industry and other industry associations, it is very alarming that our association and others are listed among them. After investigation, our association and others have not agreed to this notice. It is clear that evil people are using our names to make a show. Moreover, the convening of meetings by various industry associations has its legal procedures. Our association and others will not recognize this kind of illegal behavior. We are deeply afraid of confusing the audience, so we hereby publish a statement."</p>
<h3>After the Jiangkun Aircraft Accident</h3>
<p>It is a Pity That the Two Pilots Died</p>
<p>Chen Shaokuan and Others Personally Went to Pay Tribute</p>
<p>The Navy Aviation Department's Jiangkun aircraft crashed in the morning, due to the improper driving by the department's pilots, Li Lifeng and Chen Qihua. Both were seriously injured and sent to Baolong Hospital for treatment, but they died despite efforts to save them. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency met with the department's director, Zeng Yijing, yesterday, who spoke in detail about the circumstances of the accident. The bodies of the two deceased have been moved to the International Funeral Home. At 6:30 pm yesterday, Navy Vice Minister Chen Shaokuan led all the naval and air aviation personnel to the funeral home to preside over the main sacrificial ceremony. It is heard that the Navy Department also intends to provide compensation. The two bodies will be transported to their native Fuzhou by warship. The losses suffered by the company amounted to more than 10,000 yuan. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Truth of the Accident The deceased, Li Lifeng, graduated from the Aviation School in May of this year. He had excellent knowledge and skills and was the best of the students in the Aviation Department. There was a major reason for the accident that day. Two days ago, two British and American aviators came to the department to demonstrate aviation techniques, showing all kinds of tricks. When they flew above 150 feet, they would make small turns. Seeing this, Li was angry and said that if those Westerners could do this, why couldn't he? So, on that day, he tried all kinds of tricks, and when he was above 250 feet, he would make small turns. (According to the regulations of the department, pilots usually fly above 400 feet before making small turns, otherwise, if an accident occurs, it is not easy to remedy, because the lower the flight, the faster the fall to the ground.) He then turned the plane upside down, causing it to lose its center of gravity and fall down. Chen Qihua only had a breath left before he died. Li was still able to speak, but his skull was slightly injured and his tongue was also broken. His tongue had not been found by the time he was put into the coffin.</p>
<p>Loss Statistics According to what Director Zeng told the reporter of the Xinsheng News Agency, the loss this time was still small. A practice aircraft is only worth more than 10,000 yuan, less than 20,000. What is a pity is the tragic death of the two men. Li and Chen were both the most skilled personnel in the department. According to the usual practice, graduates of the aviation school only have more than 40 hours of flying experience, but the two deceased usually flew test flights, so they already had 160 to 170 hours of flying experience, up and down a total of more than 2,000 times. Li's skills were even better than Chen's, so it was a great pity, etc.</p>
<p>Holding a Public Memorial After Li and Chen died at Baolong Hospital, they were sent to the International Funeral Home. At 6:30 pm yesterday, Navy Vice Minister Chen Shaokuan personally went to pay tribute. Those who attended included Zeng Yijing, Director of the Navy Aircraft Department, Wu Zhennan, Director of the Coast Guard Department, Wang Zhu, representative of the China Aviation Corporation, Wu Guozhang, representative of the Eurasia Aviation Corporation, Cui Cangshi, captain of the Central Aviation Fourth Team, Chen Jiliang, commander of the Navy First Fleet, Wu Guangzong, director of the Navy Department of Surveying, Wen and Chen, two adjutants representing the aviation factory, and all the naval aviation personnel. Providing Compensation Li and Chen died in the line of duty. The Navy Department will provide compensation to their families in accordance with the regulations, but the amount has not yet been determined. After Chen Qihua's death, his brother Chen Qibin arrived at the scene. Li had no relatives. The Navy Department has ordered that if there are warships going to Fuzhou, they will bring back the coffins of the two deceased, etc.</p>
<h3>Solemn Declaration by the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions</h3>
<p>The executive and supervisory committee members of the Shanghai Special Municipality Federation of Trade Unions solemnly declare to compatriots from all walks of life and workers across the country. The Shanghai Special Municipality Federation of Trade Unions, under the unity of more than 70 organized trade unions in the city, was declared established on the 19th of this month. We have been appointed as executive and supervisory committee members by the congress of representatives of the working class in the city. We know that our talents are limited, and the task is heavy. We are deeply afraid. However, we have personally experienced the grief of the past fragmentation of the labor movement, recalled the sacrifices of the martyrs for the party and the country, thought of the groans of our compatriots in the eastern provinces who are waiting to be rescued, resented the cruelty of the violent sun's oppression, and feared the tragedy of the destruction of the country and the extermination of the race in Taiwan and Korea. We cannot but have the heart of dying, swear the same hatred, unite with the already organized trade unions in the city, take appropriate actions, and become the shield of the government's diplomacy, expanding the existing strength to unestablished trade unions so that all 800,000 workers in the city have appropriate organizations. From the unity of this city, we will extend to the provinces and to the whole country, without shrinking back, without suspicion, creating a strong will and strength, going to the national crisis together, to save the dangerous situation. This is the highest goal of this association after its establishment. Looking back at the resolutions of the congress, they are public-spirited and noble, and must be understood by all walks of life. We hope for sincerity and patience, to overcome difficulties together and gradually seek the liberation of the working class. However, a few trade unions, after receiving the notification letters from more than 30 trade unions initiating the association, suddenly held a meeting in the Nanshi area on the same day. We will not discuss their intentions for the time being. However, we are concerned that a few workers cannot distinguish and prevent themselves from being coerced and used, and cannot freely express their true ability to unite workers to settle internal affairs and resist external aggression. As a result, the entire labor movement will be difficult to progress and achieve the most desired goal, which is what we are most saddened by. Alas, the blood stains of Shenyang have not dried, and the situation in Jinzhou is tight again. Looking around the country, the opinions on national affairs are complex and the organizations are fragmented. The country, both high and low, is still fighting for power and profit, as if forgetting the impending national disaster. How can we not be saddened when we talk about this? We, moved by righteousness, accept our mission with sorrow and vow not to betray our dignity, and we must do our best to fulfill our sacred duty. Our humble wishes are truly sad. At this time when the national pulse is on the verge of breaking, in the future autumn of unity, we sincerely hope that all workers in the city, comrades and compatriots across the country will use their wisdom and talents to distinguish right from wrong, correct errors, seek sincere and lasting unity, strive to concentrate strength, organize steps, and actively serve the party and the country together, and conspire for the common interests of the nation. This is all we, who are generous in the face of difficulties, will never forget. Now that the Fourth Session of the First Plenary Session is opening, we dare to contribute our foolish sincerity, and work together with all our compatriots and workers across the country who are saving ourselves and saving the country, thinking carefully and striving to do so.

<p>Chinese Electrical Workers' Union</p>
<h3>Disturbance Occurred Yesterday</h3>
<p>Workers Implemented the Takeover of the Union</p>
<p>Authorities Sent Personnel to Thoroughly Investigate the Truth</p>
<p>The Chinese Electrical Workers' Union on Guohuo Road in Nanshi had a disturbance yesterday. It was the workers taking over the union, and the situation was quite serious. They also set a three-day deadline to resolve the year-end bonus issue. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Workers' Congress Around 11 pm the night before, the Chinese Electrical Workers held an automatic congress on Guohuo Road, publicly electing Ding Changyan, Tan Honglin, and six others as the presidium. The following resolutions were made on the spot: (1) Regarding the year-end bonus issue, those who have worked for more than one year will be given two months' salary, and those who have worked for less than one year will be given one month's salary. The company must negotiate an agreement within three days, otherwise, the most severe measures will be taken. (2) Dismiss the standing directors of the union and take over the union. (3) Elect six standing directors: Zhao Sanyuan, Hu Yida, He Zhaokui, Li Shunjin, Cai Heshang, and Tan Honglin, and three supervisors: Ding Changyan, Huang Defang, and Dong Zhaolin. The congress did not disperse until 3 am yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Situation of Disturbance At 9 am yesterday, more than 100 electrical workers, led by Tan Honglin and others, suddenly went to the entrance of the First District Water and Electricity Workers' Union on Guohuo Road to take over the union. The situation was quite serious. The union's standing directors, Tang Junsheng, Zhou Guangrong, Zhu Hanhe, Fang Ronggeng, and others, were outnumbered and unable to resist. They were forcibly taken over and did not hand over the affairs clearly until 11 am.</p>
<p>Common Talk Tang Junsheng, Zhu Hanhe, Zhou Guangrong, Jia Renjie, Xu Guangsheng, Fang Ronggeng, and other standing directors of the First District Water and Electricity Workers' Union issued a joint statement yesterday, saying: "Now, a few union members, under the direction of others, are inciting workers in the name of year-end bonuses and salary increases, slandering the union directors and refusing to negotiate. Last night, they illegally held a general meeting of members, produced directors and supervisors, and forcibly took over the union today. We, considering the national crisis and the local security, and to avoid conflicts, have no choice but to hand over the affairs clearly, and wait for the party and government organs to handle it according to law. As for the issue of salary increases, we have negotiated with the company and decided to discuss it again next year. The company has agreed to provide remedial measures for the issue of year-end bonuses."</p>
<p>Authorities Thoroughly Investigate The Second District Police Station of the Municipal Public Security Bureau was ordered to send Inspector Si, along with the senior police, to thoroughly investigate the truth in order to report it and handle it according to law. According to Tan Honglin, whom the reporter of the Xinsheng News Agency met yesterday, the former directors violated the resolutions and were economically dictatorial, so they went to take over. They also decided to go to the company today to negotiate the issue of year-end bonuses. If there are no results, they will hold another congress on the 25th and take severe measures.</p>
<h3>Joint Meeting of the Pharmaceutical Industry Workers' Union</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Pharmaceutical Industry Workers' Union held its eleventh joint meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday. Zhao Zhenhui was the chairman, Zhou Dichen was the recorder, and the etiquette was as usual. The chairman reported the purpose of the meeting (omitted). The following cases were discussed: (1) Should this association regularly convene joint meetings of directors from various districts to discuss major plans during this period? It was resolved to convene a joint meeting of all directors, supervisors, and district directors at the afternoon hour on the 24th of this month. (2) At the general meeting of representatives on the 20th of this month, it was resolved to deny the illegally organized Pharmaceutical Industry Workers' Union Reorganization Committee, and all directors and supervisors of this association will be responsible for handling the affairs of the association as usual. According to confidential reports, the illegal reorganization committee recently held an illegal general meeting of members. How should this be dealt with? It was resolved that since the general meeting of representatives has entrusted all directors and supervisors with the work of the association as usual, it is necessary to notify all members of the city not to attend illegal meetings to avoid accidental misfortunes, otherwise, the organization will not be responsible. (3) Comrade Fang Qingqin published a notice in the newspaper today resigning from his position in this association, but no letter of resignation has been received. How should this be dealt with? It was resolved to unanimously retain him. (4) The monthly fees for this month have already been issued for collection, but since the misfortune occurred, they have not been concluded on time. How should this be handled? It was resolved to notify the collectors that whether they have been collected or not, they must bring them to the association by the 24th of this month to be concluded, and there must be no delay. (5) Since the misfortune occurred in this association, the reorganization committee of the illegal organization published advertisements slandering the instructors and Zhao Zhenhui of this association, which will inevitably make the members not dare to tell the truth. Should the facts be announced to all members of the city? It was resolved to publish the facts in the newspaper and announce them to all members of the city, so that the truth can be revealed.</p>

<h3>Lawsuit Against the Shanghai Municipal Council</h3>
<p>Victory for the Shanghai Kennel Club</p>
<p>Original First Instance Judgement Overturned</p>
<p>The Ta Mei Wan Pao (Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury) reports that after the Shanghai Kennel Club's second lawsuit against the Shanghai Municipal Council regarding the racecourse in the Cadarès Garden, it achieved victory this morning (the 22nd). After the Court of Appeal, presided over by Hong Kong Chief Justice Kemp and King's Counsel Mowser, along with the British Envoy Extraordinary to China, Grain, heard the case in October, Kemp and Mowser issued their verdict today. They overturned the original judgement by Justice Lycett of the first instance court, which dismissed the case brought by the plaintiff, the Shanghai Kennel Club, against the defendants, the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Macnaghten, and the Head of the Police, Martin. During the appeal, Justice Grain, who had participated in the hearing, stated that since two judges had granted the appeal, his opinion was unnecessary, and he would reserve his judgement. Following the Shanghai Municipal Council's order to close the Cadarès Garden racecourse this spring, the Shanghai Kennel Club sued Macnaghten and Martin, seeking damages of 2.5 million taels. Justice Grain held a hearing and determined that the issue of the Shanghai Municipal Council's authority was not under the jurisdiction of British courts. According to Article 27 of the Yangjingbang Regulations, any doubts regarding the Shanghai Municipal Council's powers should be resolved by the consuls in consultation with Chinese local officials, subject to the approval of the Chinese government and the Minister in Beijing. Therefore, the lawsuit was dismissed. Consequently, the Shanghai Kennel Club appealed. Chief Justice Kemp stated that in his opinion, the respondents were being sued in the only court under his jurisdiction. Therefore, the Shanghai Kennel Club's lawsuit was not an abuse of the Chief Justice's Court. Furthermore, Chief Justice Kemp and Counsel Mowser both believed that the respondents had failed to provide evidence during the appeal to demonstrate that the appellants' lawsuit was intended to harass them or to seek improper gains. They also failed to prove that the case lacked obvious merit. It was also recognized that the appellants had presented a reasoned case, and the appeal was not trivial or frivolous. Therefore, the appeal by the members of the Shanghai Kennel Club was granted, the original first instance judgement was overturned, and the court costs were to be borne by the respondents.</p>
<p>Changxing's New Creation</p>
<h3>Unprecedented Giant Ship Arrives in China</h3>
<p>Ship Name: Empress of Britain</p>
<p>Capacity: 43,000 Tons</p>
<p>Expected Arrival in Shanghai: Mid-February</p>
<p>Since the Changxing Shipping Company of this port put the 32,000-ton (displacement) Empress of Japan, built last year at a cost of 2 million pounds, into service on the Pacific route, the American President Lines has also built two new ships, the President Hoover and the President Coolidge, larger than the Empress of Japan. The Changxing Company has invested another 3 million pounds to build an even larger new ship of over 40,000 tons. The construction has taken three years and has now been completed. It is named the Empress of Britain. Its maiden voyage will be a round-the-world trip, and it is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai in February. This ship will be the largest passenger liner in the Far East and the largest and fastest ship to arrive in Shanghai since the establishment of self-operated commercial shipping. The ship has now departed from New York and is heading to China via Europe. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Grand Design: The ship was built by John Brown &amp; Company in the UK and completed last month. It has a displacement of over 50,000 tons and a net tonnage of 42,348 tons. It is 765 feet long, 100 feet longer than the current President Hoover, and 85 feet wide. The ship has eleven decks from the hold to the deck surface, with 465 first-class cabins, 260 special third-class cabins, and 470 third-class cabins. The crew and service staff number 714. The ship is powered by electricity and has four propellers powered by the latest-style engines in the world. Due to its high speed, it uses 60,000 horsepower. Due to the new design, it is very fuel-efficient. During the completion test drive, it reached a speed of 25.52 nautical miles per hour. It only takes eight and a half days to cross the Pacific. The ship has 22 lifeboats and motorboats and can carry a seaplane. It is the largest ship in the Changxing Empress fleet.</p>
<p>Magnificent Decoration: The Empress of Britain is equipped with reception rooms, dining rooms, gardens, swimming pools, gyms, ballrooms, wireless rooms, smoking rooms, etc., all with special equipment. The most beautiful and valuable carpets are used throughout. Its magnificence is comparable to a palace at sea. The first-class cabins are divided into double and single rooms, each with a bathroom. It is said that dozens of types of antique porcelain, wood, and stone were used for the interior decoration, all purchased from various countries. Therefore, the decoration of each room is unique. Departure to Shanghai: After the completion of the giant ship, its maiden voyage is a world tour. It arrived in New York in the United States on the 3rd of this month. People from all walks of life came to visit the ship. It has now taken on more than 370 tourists for the world tour and has departed from New York, heading to Shanghai via Europe from the Atlantic Ocean. The Changxing Company in this port has received a telegram from the ship stating that it will arrive in Shanghai on February 16. At that time, people from all walks of life will be invited to visit the ship. The ship's capacity and speed will break all previous records. Shen Chengfu</p>
<h3>200,000 Yuan Shop Guarantee</h3>
<p>Taihe Foreign Firm Withdraws Private Lawsuit</p>
<p>Trial Postponed for Two Weeks</p>
<p>The British firm Taihe Yanghang recently filed a lawsuit against compradore Shen Chengfu in the First Special District Court for breach of trust and embezzlement. The circumstances of the trial have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Xu Jiajun, along with court clerk Guan, continued the hearing in the First Criminal Court. First, Shen Chengfu's lawyers, Jiang Yiping and Shan Yuhua, stated that the plaintiff had filed a partial civil suit before the criminal suit was initiated. Now that the case has been prosecuted by the police, and the plaintiff has also filed an incidental private suit, it seems inappropriate. The plaintiff's lawyer, Luo, stated that they had already withdrawn the part of the incidental private suit concerning the 3,550 bales of cotton. Jiang Yiping continued, stating that the defendant's health has been weak and that he has been ill since being detained. The amount involved in the case is very large, and the circumstances are extremely complex. It is impossible to understand without a detailed examination of the accounts. Therefore, they requested permission to be released on bail to investigate the accounts, so that the facts of the case could be clarified and it could be determined whether the defendant should bear criminal responsibility. The court then questioned Soroci, the former head of the cotton department of Taihe Yanghang, asking whether Shen Chengfu had entered into any secret agreement with him besides the contract with Taihe. Soroci denied it. Judge Xu said that since Taihe's account books had not yet been presented to the court, the case could not proceed and had to be postponed. He instructed Taihe to present the account books for verification. The defendant's lawyers, Jiang and Shan, once again requested bail. The plaintiff's lawyer, Luo, expressed opposition, saying that if Shen Chengfu was released on bail, he might sell his property, which would be greatly detrimental to the plaintiff, and he should still be detained. The defendant's lawyers insisted on bail, saying that if Shen was detained and died, would the plaintiff's lawyer be able to bear the corresponding responsibility? After a long argument, the police representative, lawyer Ru Baoyi, stood up and said that for criminal cases, the main considerations for granting bail are whether the case is serious and whether there is a risk of escape. The fact that the defendant, Shen Chengfu, had previously attempted to escape was true, but it was also true that he later surrendered himself so there was not an intention to suppress evidence. Now that he has surrendered, it seems unlikely that he would try to escape again. As for the plaintiff's lawyer's claim that the defendant might sell his property if released on bail and their objection to bail, there is no basis for this. Therefore, he requested the court to pay attention to whether the case is serious and whether there is a risk of escape to determine whether bail should be granted. Judge Xu then ruled that the case would be postponed for two weeks. Shen Chengfu was to pay a shop guarantee of 400,000 yuan. Lawyer Jiang, upon hearing this, said that the amount of the guarantee could be reduced because it would be difficult to find a business in Shanghai willing to provide such a large sum. Therefore, to protect the defendant's interests, he requested that the court allow the guarantee to be reduced to 100,000 yuan. Judge Xu considered this and then ordered that Shen Chengfu could be released on a shop guarantee of 200,000 yuan to await summons.</p>

<h3>Assassinated Youth Dies</h3>
<p>Victim of Factional Conflict</p>
<p>An assassination attempt occurred at 5:45 PM the day before yesterday in Jianye Lane, Fulü Lane, in the French Concession. A young man was shot and fell to the ground, while the three assailants fled. The lane watchman reported the incident to the police, who sent the injured man to Guangci Hospital for treatment. When questioned about the incident, the victim refused to divulge any information. Details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that the injured man has been identified by the detective as Liang Guixing, 33 years old, from Henan Province, residing in the back building of the Gonghexin Paper Store at 29 Remy Road in the French Concession for only one month. He was alone and had no family members. It is said that he was a member of a political faction and was lured to Jianye Lane for assassination. He was shot, and the bullet entered his right side and exited through his back. He died at 12:00 AM that night due to his injuries. The hospital notified the police, who transported the body to the Tongren Fuyuan branch hall for an autopsy. At 10:00 AM yesterday, Prosecutor Ding Shikui of the Second Special District Court, along with a French forensic doctor, arrived at the hall and confirmed that the deceased had died from a gunshot wound sustained during his lifetime. Since there were no family members, the official ordered that the body be collected by the Tongren Fuyuan Hall. The police then took photos of the body and had it buried by the hall, pending identification by relatives. The police are investigating the assailants.</p>
<p>Falsely Representing Sale of Military Weapons</p>
<h3>Attempting to Defraud for Financial Gain</h3>
<p>Shen Xueming and Others Fined 60 Yuan Each</p>
<p>Cai Liu, a Cantonese-speaking Chinese detective in the Old Gate police station, recently received a tip that someone was secretly selling weapons in Room 52 of the Yipinxin Inn on Xizang Road. On the 19th of this month, Cai, pretending to be a representative of the Guangdong military, wanting to order a large quantity of military equipment, went to Yipinxin and met Shen Xueming, Wang Daosong, Tang Ziyou, and three other people. After contacting them, they agreed to discuss the matter again at the same location the next day. On the 20th, Detective Cai returned, and Tang Ziyou showed him a Mauser pistol, saying that this was a sample. Cai then answered he wants to buy twelve of them. He agreed to a price of 180 yuan per pistol, including 100 bullets and a wooden holster, for a total of 2,200 yuan. They agreed to meet at 9:00 AM on the 21st in Room 91 of the Xinxin Inn, where half of the money would be paid first, along with six Mauser pistols, in exchange for silver. Detective Cai then reported to the police chief. At the appointed time, he secretly dispatched Detective Howell, Detective Yu Agen, Inspector Wang Jinshou, Liu Junqing, and others to wait at the Xinxin Inn. Meanwhile, Cai went alone to Yipinxin. Soon after, Cai received a phone call from Shen Xueming from the Xinxin Inn, saying that the goods had been delivered and requesting him to quickly bring 1,100 yuan to pick them up. By this time, the Chinese and foreign detectives had also arrived, so what Shen and Cai said on the phone was overheard by the detectives. Convinced that the weapons had been obtained, they arrested Shen and entered Room 91, where they arrested Wang Daosong, Tang Ziyou, Xun Hangsong, and three other people. However, after searching the room, no weapons were found. At 3:00 PM, they arrested Han Huixing and took him to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the summary court of the First Special District Court. Judge Jiang Gongliang questioned them, and the police lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated the case, saying that after arresting the five defendants and interrogating them at the police station, they learned that the defendants were running an empty fort, falsely claiming to be selling weapons with the purpose of defrauding for financial gain. The defendants confessed at the police station that they did not have weapons. The sample Mauser pistol was borrowed from someone named Jia who was still at large. They intended to use it to convince people that they had weapons in order to achieve their goal of defrauding. Therefore, the police are now prosecuting them for attempted fraud under Article 363 of the Criminal Code. The Chinese and foreign detectives also reported the circumstances of the contact and arrest, and said that the fifth defendant, Han Huixing, went to the Xinxin Inn at 3:00 PM yesterday and told the tea boy that because of the incident at Yipinxin, they did not want to rent Room 91. They overheard this and arrested him. When questioned, the defendants gave evasive answers and hired lawyers to defend them in court. After verifying the confessions, Judge Jiang sentenced Shen Xueming, Wang Daosong, Tang Ziyou, and Xun Hangsong to a joint charge of attempted fraud, fining them 60 yuan each. Han Huixing was found not guilty.</p>
<h3>Aftermath of Death of Railway Bureau Staff Member</h3>
<p>Adopted Son Accused of Forgery</p>
<p>Appeals Against Original Judgement</p>
<p>Zhou Changwu, also known as Henian, a special staff member of the Lianglu Railway, died on July 10 of this year. During his lifetime, he adopted Qian Yanling as his son and was very fond of him. In June of this year, when Zhangwu became ill and could not work, his duties were taken over by Yanling. Zhangwu's brother-in-law, Chen Henian, also wanted to take over Zhangwu's position. His cousin, Shi Xi, planned this for him. The Railway Bureau believed that Chen did not know English and could not qualify, so Yanling took over Zhangwu's vacant position. During his lifetime, Zhangwu received a nominal salary of 30 yuan from the Nanjing Stamp Tax Bureau. In June, Zhangwu personally wrote a note instructing Yanling to send a letter to his friend Miao Rongshan in Nanjing to collect the salary. On July 31, Yanling wrote to Miao again to collect the salary from the Stamp Tax Bureau. Because the seal was incorrect, it was returned. Zhou Shixi found this letter in his home and believed that Yanling was guilty of forgery. He reported it to the police, who detained him and sent him to the First Court of the Special District. The initial trial sentenced Yanling to two months' imprisonment. Yanling refused to accept the sentence and hired lawyer Zhang Ding to appeal to the Second Branch of the Higher Court. Yesterday was the date of the trial, presided over by Judge Song Yuan. First, Qian Yanling stated that this case was entirely because Chen Shixi wanted to replace Xianwen's wife, Chen Henian, in order to obtain a position in the Railway Bureau, and framed him to be sentenced to imprisonment. According to the salary receipt sent to Nanjing, it was written by Shixi, who then ordered him to write the envelope and send it to the Miao family in Nanjing. He never handled this letter after that, and the initial trial said that this returned letter was found in Shixi's home on August 10. According to him, this letter was sent out on August 15, so how could it be found on the 10th? Later, he realized there was an error and changed the date to the lunar calendar. Moreover, on the day of the detention, Shixi had already arranged for a detective to wait at the door. After being sent to the police station, the police refused to accept it because there was no evidence. Shixi returned home and brought two books as evidence before they would take him. Everyone who works in the Railway Bureau has these books, so it is not yet known whether they were in his possession. Therefore, the facts are suspicious and resemble a conspiracy to frame him. He asked for justice. Next, Xianwen, Zhou Shixi's brother, appeared in court as an agent, saying that Shixi was busy with funeral arrangements in the countryside and could not attend the hearing. He was very clear about this case and came to represent him. He testified that the returned letter from Nanjing was indeed picked up by him at the Zhongxi Department Store on Haining Road when he and Shixi came to play. As for the claim that he wanted to seek a position, it was completely fabricated. The court then ordered him to write a note in order to compare handwriting. Finally, the lawyers on both sides were instructed to argue the case, and the verdict was announced to be delivered on the 28th of this month.</p>
<h3>Traveler Commits Suicide</h3>
<p>A traveler checked into the Jintai Hotel on Fuzhou Road on the 20th, claiming to be surnamed Tang, named Qiren, 21 years old, from Shaoxing, residing in Room 95. Yesterday afternoon, he went to bed very early and instructed the tea boy to wake him up at 9:00 PM. When the time came, Yang covered him with a quilt and lay down. He shook him, but there was no response. He opened the quilt to look, and his face had turned pale, and his breath was very weak. He was rushed to Renji Hospital for treatment but died before he arrived. His suicide note was found, stating the reason for his suicide. It is heard that the deceased was a partner in a bookstore.</p>
<h3>Lu A'mei Cannot Bear Life as Prostitute</h3>
<p>Escapes and Requests Legal Assistance</p>
<p>Lu A'mei, a woman from Nanxun, 20 years old, was sold by her own husband to Shen Shunshan, who currently lives at 698 Furun Lane, Beijing Road, in 1929, and forced into prostitution for more than two years. A'mei is attractive and has many customers. However, at times like this, when there is little income due to constant rain, Shen resorts to violence, severely beating her or forcing her to stand naked in the cold, inflicting all kinds of abuse, which is unbearable. Recently, A'mei took advantage of an opportunity when no one was watching and escaped alone, going directly to lawyer Feng Buqing's office to request legal assistance. It is heard that lawyer Feng has drafted a complaint on her behalf and filed a criminal lawsuit with the First Court of the Special District.</p>
<p>Wireless Radio Station Colleagues</p>
<h3>Organize Consumer Cooperative</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of the colleagues of the Wireless Radio General Station of the Ministry of Communications has spared no effort in its anti-Japanese work. It is heard that the association, feeling that it is difficult to distinguish between Chinese and Japanese goods, in order to resolutely reject Japanese goods and earnestly promote national goods, has specially organized a consumer cooperative to specialize in daily necessities of Chinese origin. The establishment of the cooperative is entirely voluntary, and the goods are sold at cost. It is heard that the buyers are very enthusiastic. Furthermore, the association is actively preparing for the "Four Simplifications" movement, striving for frugality in clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Once the methods are determined, they will be put into practice.</p>

<h3>Emergency Meeting Held Yesterday</h3>
<p>After the reorganized committee of the Pharmaceutical Workers' Union was established by representatives elected by all workers, it began the reorganization work. On the 18th, it took over the union. Recently, the committee learned that Lin Zhao and others were still secretly active, attempting to make a comeback, and fabricating facts, publishing them in newspapers, confusing outside observers. Therefore, the reorganized committee convened a joint meeting of all reorganization committee members and representatives of each district committee at 7:00 PM yesterday to discuss countermeasures. Chairman Fang Zheng presided over the meeting and resolved the following motions: (1) How to deal with Lin Meiyan and Zhao Zhenhui's activities outside the union?

<p>University United</p>
<h3>Submission to the First Plenary Session of the Fourth National Congress</h3>
<p>Regarding the Handling of the Aftermath of the December 17th Tragedy</p>
<p>A joint submission from university students to the First Plenary Session of the Fourth National Congress stated: "Submitting a special delegation to urgently propose and clarify (regarding the December 17th Tragedy) methods for handling the aftermath, requesting full acceptance to uphold justice and appease public anger. Since the Japanese invaders have been rampaging since September 18th, the government has abandoned its duty to protect the country and its people, repeatedly retreating, leading to the ever-increasing arrogance of the invaders and the intensification of the atmosphere of aggression. We, as descendants of the Yellow Emperor, cannot bear to see our nation perish. Therefore, based on the principle that (everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the nation), we petitioned in the capital once, and urged the government to send troops to resist the Japanese a second time, running around and appealing, enduring many hardships. What we hoped for in our hearts was that our patriotic zeal would move and awaken the leaders of the authorities to rise up, resist aggression, and seek survival. However, the government superficially accepted our requests, but in reality, it has not sent troops, procrastinating and delaying, damaging its own credibility. Furthermore, it fears us like snakes and scorpions, and guards against us like fire and water. Every time we entered the capital, the person in charge of the National Government would issue statements, affirming that we were deliberately causing trouble and had ulterior motives. The Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters would secretly sabotage or openly slander us, and the news published by the Central News Agency and the Central Daily News were even more deliberately fabricated and slandered, attempting to cover the eyes and ears of the world with the crime of being reactionary, and eliminate the patriotic movement in its infancy. We, with pure intentions and sincere hearts, sacrificed our studies and time, and strived to resist Japan and save the nation. However, the government's attitude towards us has been repeatedly like this. Although it has spared no effort to damage its own reputation after the fact, correcting the falsehoods of its previous statements, how heartbroken are we! On the 16th of this month, at the invitation of students from Beiping, Jinan, Suzhou, Nanjing, and other places, we formed a team to enter the capital to urge the government to make a final decision to resist Japan and save the nation with a firm attitude. As soon as we arrived at Xiaguan, we heard that Beiping students had clashed with military police while petitioning the Central Party Headquarters, and that two gentlemen, Cai Zimin and Chen Zhenru, were injured, and many students were also injured and arrested. We deeply regretted this. At that time, according to the Central Daily News, the Beiping students were identified as (Communists) and (irrationally causing trouble), while according to the reports and emergency extras issued by the Beiping students, the opposite was true. The incident happened suddenly, and it was not easy for us to ascertain the truth. However, based on our own past experiences, we believed that since the government and the Party Headquarters and Party newspapers could repeatedly falsely accuse us of being reactionary, it would not be difficult for them to falsely accuse the Beiping students later based on their consistent policy of spreading rumors. Therefore, we dared not believe the news published by the Central Daily News. The situation was like this, and the reasoning was also like this. However, in addition to having abundant sympathy, we were not without concern for what was necessary. Since we organized the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, all our actions have been based on two basic principles: first, standing on a purely nationalistic position, we absolutely do not want to be used by any party or faction; second, our actions must be aimed at gaining social sympathy. Anything that is not the urgent requirement of the patriotic movement of the masses, but is enough to satisfy the hearts of the people, we will not do. Based on these two major principles, our organizations have been unusually strict and our discipline has been unusually strict every time we entered the capital. When we arrived at Xiaguan this time, all the students were checked twice, and all slogans and leaflets were not allowed to be carried. At the joint meetings of various units, all radical and empty slogans were opposed. Uniting students from all over the country to carry out orderly and meaningful anti-Japanese national salvation actions was our only central idea in this movement. On the morning of the 17th, the entire team set off, and we were in the first column. When we were passing by the Central Party Headquarters, we suddenly received a report that the Beiping students in the rear were negotiating with the Central Party Headquarters to release the arrested students, and asking the front column to support them. Driven by sympathy, we decided to leave a small number of troops to wait for a while before advancing. However, in order to avoid misunderstandings, we were about twenty yards away from the Beiping students. The staff of the Central Party Headquarters witnessed this situation, and residents along the road can testify to it. Unexpectedly, just as the vanguard troops arrived, we suddenly received a report that some students in the rear were surrounded and beaten by thugs for questioning the Central Daily News, and a conflict occurred. The vanguard students were extremely angry when they heard this, and rushed back to rescue them. Since the (January 29th) incident, the Shanghai Party police authorities have been buying thugs to kidnap and beat students. The students have deeply hated the authorities' gangster policy, and would naturally rise up to help when they heard the police report. However, as soon as the students arrived near the Central Daily News, most of the military police suddenly shouted loudly, or used sticks or bayonets to charge and engage in hand-to-hand combat with the students. The sounds of (kill) (kill) were endless. The students were unarmed and retreated one after another. However, the military police recklessly displayed their ferocity and carried out vicious attacks, relentlessly attacking unarmed young students who were retreating, determined to put them to death. Under the bayonets, rifle butts, wooden sticks, and stones, the number of students who died or were injured instantly reached hundreds. Some were even pushed into the water after being stabbed or beaten, and then attacked with huge stones. Alas! The people of the country spend tens of millions of military expenses every year to support soldiers, but the soldiers are extremely tolerant towards Japanese imperialists, and never dare to add a single arrow to them. However, they have exhausted their brutal and murderous abilities towards our patriotic youth. What the evil warlords of the past dared not do, the military police under our Blue Sky White Sun banner have brazenly done. Once the tragic change occurred, the dead and injured were everywhere. In addition to gathering the scattered and fleeing students and rushing back to the Central University to avoid a more serious conflict, we dispatched female rescue teams wearing red cross armbands to rescue the injured. However, the military police, regardless of the circumstances, violently beat the rescue team and fired more than ten shots into the air to intimidate them. Alas! What the belligerent countries in the European war could not bear to do, the military police under our Blue Sky White Sun banner brazenly did to our countrymen, leaving our nation with unprecedented shame and opening the greatest evil precedent in Chinese and foreign countries, making Mr. Sun Yat-sen, if he were alive, would be extremely saddened and weep bitterly. That night, the students were extremely exhausted and went to bed to rest. However, the next morning, before dawn, thousands of military police suddenly surrounded Zhongda layer by layer.</p>

<p>In addition to firing shots to demonstrate, they also sent planes to hover in the sky, and soldiers broke into our bedrooms, forcibly ordering us to get up and loudly declaring the government's intentions, saying that we were being used by the Communists and had to be immediately escorted back to Shanghai, and that anyone who disobeyed would be executed as a rioter. Alas! We do not know who the Communists are, and we have never wanted to be used by the Communists. If there is indeed a fact of being used, then the promoters of our being used are actually the Party and government authorities and the Party-run newspapers that have repeatedly spread rumors and slanders, causing us to lose credibility. We do not take the blame. Seeing that the situation was urgent at the time, we did not want to cause further disputes, so we gathered our teams and set off in order. However, with a clear conscience, we sincerely asked for the release of the innocent arrested students and the return of the bodies of the dead students. However, the new warlord Song Xilian refused this reasonable request and behaved aggressively and impetuously. In addition to slapping and insulting the students who were crying over the corpses, he also tied them up and abused them. The organized and planned oppression of patriotic youth by the military is now evident. After the brigade was escorted to Xiaguan, we sent representatives to negotiate with the police hall and the Ministry of Education to claim the corpses, but to no avail. Song then forced the cars to drive, escorting us back to Shanghai. This is (the whole story of the December 17th Tragedy). After returning to Shanghai, all the students remaining in Shanghai were extremely indignant and wanted to go to Beijing again to fight to the death with the murderers who massacred our classmates in order to fight for national dignity. We thought over and over again, deeply believing that the convention had already opened, bringing together senior members of the Kuomintang. If they did not forget their history and cut themselves off from the masses, they would definitely use the law to uphold justice, vent their anger, and comfort us and the national integrity that had been sacrificed and oppressed for the sake of resisting Japan and saving the nation. For this reason, we sent a delegation to urgently propose and clarify the following opinions on handling the aftermath of the (December 17th) tragedy: (1) Immediately release the arrested students; (2) Investigate the perpetrators and instigators; (3) Order the government to apologize to the people; (4) Provide compensation to the students who were killed or injured; (5) Guarantee that the same oppression of students will not happen again in the future. The above points are the most common and minimum requirements, in order to win back the hearts of the people, prevent future disasters, quell the public anger of the whole country, and show the world justice. Therefore, we earnestly ask the convention not to abandon our humble opinions, fully accept them, and implement them decisively, without any hesitation. We respectfully submit this to the First Plenary Session of the Fourth National Congress of the Kuomintang of China."</p>
<h3>Statement by Wang Hanliang and Others</h3>
<p>Disavowing the Committee for Improving Party Affairs</p>
<p>Wang Hanliang, Chen Yafu, Zhang Yichen, and others stated that they had not participated in the Committee for Improving Party Affairs, saying: According to yesterday's newspaper, over 1,400 people claiming to be loyal comrades, including Wang Jialun, held an emergency meeting of city party members at Shenyuan and established a Committee for Improving Party Affairs, nominating Hanliang and the other two as executive members. This is deeply surprising. Since taking office as executive members of the Committee for Improving Party Affairs, Hanliang and others have advocated in previous declarations that they will work with all comrades to improve party affairs and will not participate in other organizations. They were not consulted before the convening of the meeting, and they do not know any of the elected members. Therefore, they do not recognize any actions of the meeting and fear that the outside world will not understand the truth. They hereby jointly declare this.</p>

<h3>Mr. Li Zhongrong's Dispatch (Pay Attention to Recent Actions of France and Russia)</h3>
<p>Recently, a new incident has occurred, concerning a matter of great importance to the nation, which the people must pay close attention to. News has emerged from the United States that France and Japan have concluded a special agreement concerning China, with Japan guaranteeing France's occupation of one of China's provinces. Although both Japanese and French authorities have absolutely denied this, after experiencing the following three things, we cannot help but be suspicious: (1) Recently, France has sent troops to Annam to disturb the Guangxi border, and the government considers this matter quite important, so it has dispatched high officials Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi to Guangxi to defend it effectively. We fear that the province of China that Japan guarantees France's occupation of may be Guangxi. Guangxi is adjacent to France's colony of Annam and its leased territory of Guangzhou Bay. If France lays its hands on Guangxi, it can permanently rule Annam on the one hand, and obtain economic and military advantages on the other, and in the key areas of the two Guangs, it can create a confrontational situation with Hong Kong, which is ruled by Guangdong and the British. (2) After the Mukden Incident, French public opinion supported Japan. If Japan did not promise France some special benefits, wouldn't it be willingly serving as a tool for evil? (3) Russia has recently proposed convening a Far East round table conference. I am afraid that it also knows about the agreement between Japan and France, so it is holding a conference to hinder it, or to demand to join it, and cooperate with them to secretly divide China. Fang Ze is now in Moscow negotiating secretly with the Russian Foreign Minister. It looks like it is more ominous than auspicious.</p>
<p>If Japan, France, and Russia succeed in secretly invading China, then the remaining imperialist powers will also join in the fun, and that will be the end of it. People, pay attention to how our government will respond!</p>
<p>(Reply) The French envoy has firmly denied the matter of France invading the Yunnan-Guangxi border areas. However, our people must pay attention to such places at all times. Fang Ze passed through Moscow, claiming to stay for a few days, which also deserves attention.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated that the Yangtze River basin and coastal areas would be mostly cloudy with possible rain. There would be localized snowfall in the Yellow Sea. The wind was variable east of Shandong. There was a northeasterly wind in the East China Sea. Also, the highest temperature in the city in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday was 54.5, and the lowest was 41.9. On the same day last year, the highest was 41.9 and the lowest was 33.8.</p>

<p>Automobile News</p>
<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Automobiles and Life</h3>
<p>Daily Necessities, Not Luxuries</p>
<p>In modern times, the automobile industry has advanced rapidly, showing a tremendous momentum. In countries with developed material civilization in Europe and America, almost every household owns one. They are already regarded as indispensable daily necessities. In fact, automobiles are related to the lives of the masses and enhance the welfare of the world. There is no need to say that they are essential daily necessities. However, the situation is different in our country. Our economy is in decline, lagging behind others in every aspect. The standard of living is also lower than in Europe and America. Therefore, people in our country do not enjoy automobiles as much as they do. Furthermore, the general public's view of automobiles is also different. For example, in Shanghai, the roads are crisscrossed, and there is a constant flow of traffic. Automobiles are already a common sight. However, if you were to ask a passerby: "Are automobiles daily necessities or luxuries?" I dare to say that 30% of the answers would be the former, while 70% would be the latter. If Shanghai, a place that leads the way in everything, is like this, what would people think of automobiles in remote and ignorant areas? Some even regard them as mysterious monsters. I once saw in a British notebook that when he was in Tibet, he actually saw scholars worshiping automobiles and regarding them as deities. Although this is an absolute example and cannot be said to be the case for everyone, it cannot be said that it has no value as an example. Therefore, when discussing automobiles in China, the fundamental standpoint is naturally different from that in Europe and America. Let me elaborate on the reasons below. The first point of the rapid advancement of the automobile industry in Europe and America is industrial development. The use of mechanical manpower and the development of various raw materials have led to a large production volume and economical prices once automobiles are manufactured. Therefore, the widespread popularity of automobiles is within expectations. The second point is that national economies are abundant and people's wealth is widespread. Therefore, after the production of automobiles, there is a great demand, and production and sales are booming. In a blink of an eye, automobiles have become popular throughout the country and are regarded as daily necessities. The third point is that road construction is excellent, with roads extending in all directions, allowing automobiles to travel everywhere. Suburban travel and modern walking can all utilize automobiles. With these three reasons, the automobile industry in Europe and America is becoming more prosperous and developed day by day. The difference in situation compared to our country cannot be measured by distance. Our country's production is backward, and transportation is blocked. Although there are raw materials for manufacturing cars, there is no way to develop or utilize them. Therefore, automobiles must be sought from foreign countries, across mountains and seas, and the journey is long. The cost of a car is more than double that of the place of production. This is only in terms of the source of automobiles. There are also other related factors that can be further discussed. The previous section only discussed the difference in sources. In terms of purchase and usage, there are also great differences compared to Europe and America, which are ahead in development. Let me explain from two aspects. One is the purchase of automobiles. The enjoyment of material civilization by the Chinese people has not yet reached its peak. The number of people using mechanical objects in daily life is very small. The reason for this has already been stated above, namely, the lack of industrial development and economic decline. Therefore, the purchase of automobiles is initially limited to wealthy people. Families of average wealth have no possibility of owning this kind of transportation tool. Things are valued for their scarcity. The purchase of automobiles is so difficult, so it is no wonder that the general public regards them as luxuries. Compared with the United States, which produces the most automobiles, the difference is like heaven and earth. A few years ago, a slogan prevailed in the United States, meaning (Every family must purchase an automobile.) However, the situation has changed today, and the automobile industry has advanced even more. Therefore, this slogan has changed to (Every person an automobile.) Comparing them with us, how different are we? Let's take Shanghai, the most prosperous city in the country, as an example. It is still far behind. According to the latest statistics for the city, the total number of automobiles in Shanghai is still less than 7,000. If we compare it to a population of one million, 100 families cannot own one car. Second, is the use of automobiles. Everyone knows that automobiles are useful transportation tools. However, in order to realize the function of automobiles, we must first have wide and flat roads. Let me ask, what is the state of road construction in various parts of the country today? Can every road be used by automobiles? Even if we take a step back and say that there are roads that automobiles can travel on, where will the automobiles go? Therefore, even if we have an excellent transportation tool that can carry heavy loads, there is no way to maximize its potential. However, automobiles have their own prominent position today. They benefit people and have great uses. They really cannot be listed among luxury goods. I would like to quote the words of Mr. Yin Shengbo, the editor-in-chief of an American automobile magazine, regarding the value of automobiles. (The automobile manufacturing industry is recently striving to change the prevailing notion that automobiles are luxuries that should be taxed and restricted. When automobiles first emerged, they were expensive and only used by the wealthy. However, as production volume increased and prices fell, the use of automobiles gradually expanded. They are not only personal transportation but also necessary for public transportation.</p>
<p>It is not uncommon for various countries to regard automobiles as luxury goods and levy considerable taxes on them. However, modern countries seeking economic development and competing with other countries must rely on automobile transportation and good roads.</p>
<p>Today, 90% of automobile transportation is for commercial and essential purposes, and only 10% is for luxury. Let me reiterate this as a message to the political and business circles. The reason why automobiles are regarded as luxury goods may be due to the word "driving for pleasure." However, the meaning of driving for pleasure is difficult to define. For example, driving with family to the suburbs on Sundays, although not entirely luxurious, is still close to it. If the purpose is entertainment or socializing, it can be regarded as luxury. Therefore, there are two aspects of automobiles that are luxurious, namely, driving for pleasure, entertainment, and socializing. On the other hand, the commercial and necessary uses of automobiles include freight vehicles, long-distance buses, taxis, sales trucks, company cars, private cars, farmers' cars, doctors' cars, public utilities vehicles such as electricity and telephone companies, government official cars, mail cars, fire trucks, ambulances, etc. Comparing these two categories, we can see that essential automobile transportation accounts for more than 90%, while luxury accounts for only a small percentage.</p>
<p>This situation exists in all countries, not only in the United States. The development of the automobile industry is booming and is not limited by world industrial oppression or any obstacles. The automobile industry has only recently adapted to the needs of transportation and is gradually being promoted, and the needs of transportation are also increasing. The future is long and immeasurable.</p>
<p>An automobile industry leader once said that the progress of the automobile industry will not stop until everyone can drive, own, and use an automobile that lasts a long time.</p>

<p>Chrysler Increases Car Production: According to Mr. Heckingsen, Vice President and Treasurer of Chrysler, Chrysler's automobile manufacturing and sales in the third quarter of this year, September, have increased compared to the same period last year, 1930. According to his report, a total of 23,759 cars were produced this September, while 15,720 cars were produced during the same period last year. Compared with each other, it shows an increase of 51%. In the third quarter of this year, a total of 103,227 Chrysler cars were shipped to distributors, while 55,665 cars were shipped during the same period in 1930. The total increase is 85%. If calculated by adding up the nine months, the total number of cars produced in the nine months of this year is 242,953, while the number last year was 238,063, an increase of 2%.</p>
<p>Soviet Russia Achieves Remarkable Results in Car Manufacturing: The Stalinle factory in Soviet Russia, which specializes in manufacturing tractors, has been producing more and more products recently with good results, which is celebrated by the people of the Kramorin area. This factory was founded in the summer of 1930. At that time, some people said that the timing was too early and there would be no good results. Therefore, the Soviet Russian government regarded this work as a kind of experiment. In the past, there were no leaders with specialized knowledge in the factory, and there were very few skilled workers. It was not easy to operate a new factory and make it produce good products. However, today, this is not the case. The Soviet Russian leaders feel that the operation of this factory has reached the road to success, and the products are practical. In September of this year, the factory produced a total of 2,151 tractors. By working</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>on weekdays, the average number of cars produced per day is 82. However, this number is only an average calculation of the day. In exceptional cases, there are more products. Up to 100 cars can be manufactured every day. At the beginning of this factory's innovation, all kinds of equipment were quite simple. Not only was there a shortage of talents. Therefore, in the months after its establishment, the number of daily output was quite small. In the first month, only about 20 cars were produced per day. And because the manufacturing was poor and the quality was not good, it was not durable when used. It often became waste after a few days of use. Therefore, some people said that the products of the Stalinle factory proved that Soviet Russia was not capable of creating a first-class automobile manufacturing plant. However, the workers in the factory were not discouraged by the poor products and continued to work hard and make continuous progress. Later, the products improved day by day, and the quantity also increased day by day. By July of last year, its output had jumped from 20 vehicles per day to 50 vehicles per day. By September, it had increased to 82 vehicles. Therefore, the forecast of producing 100 tractors a day in October of this year will definitely become a reality.</p>
<p>Discussion</p>
<p>Scattered Grass on the Bund</p>
<h3>Can Be Changed to a Parking Lot - A Ping</h3>
<p>Behind the Bronze Man Wharf, in front of the Jianghai Customs Office, there is a rectangular open space. The land is located on the Huangpu Bund. In the past, it was covered with clean grass. Now, it is scattered, messy, and dirty. It is surrounded by iron rings. The situation inside is indescribable. It is common to see two or three young people playing and chasing each other, seeking fun and making merry. All of this is a loss to the public. Do you remember it? Try to look around the left and right sides of the Bund again. There are many parked cars, and those who come to the area to find a place are even more numerous. Shanghai currently has 12,000 cars. The Bund is a must-pass road. Almost all of them are concentrated here. In addition, the latest parking regulations make it difficult for cars to wait temporarily on the roads near the Bund. Therefore, the Bund has become the only parking lot in the central area of Shanghai. It is a pity that the open space has been almost completely occupied.</p>
<p>The land price in the central area is indeed expensive, but the main reason is that the Bund has a convenient location. Ladies and gentlemen from afar gather here, and merchants come every day. They work here and eat lunch nearby. After that, there are those who come to shop for goods one after another. It is not until late that the ladies drive home from the Bund.</p>
<p>Shanghai's car management staff have no way to solve the parking problem. The central area has no land to accommodate so many vehicles that are increasing day by day.</p>
<p>Why does the Public Concession's Public Works Department not remove the iron rings around the scattered grass and turn it into a parking lot? It is estimated that such an increase in open space would be more than 1,000 meters. In other words, one-twelfth of Shanghai's cars would be able to solve their problems outside.</p>
<p>London's Public Buses</p>
<p>There are four pieces of grass on the Bund. The two pieces closer to the park are slightly cleaner. They can indeed be used to decorate Shanghai's waterfront. However, the other two pieces are indeed occupied by peddlers and beggars. Therefore, they neither make the Bund more beautiful nor are they of any benefit.</p>
<p>Although there are many articles discussing car-related issues, this one is the most valuable because it has concrete suggestions. (The above article is translated from Mr. Lu Yi, a Westerner and staff member of the Mainland Daily, who presented his opinions to the Public Works Department.)</p>
<p>Regarding Shanghai's Concession</p>
<h3>A Discussion on Public Buses - Xiao Guoxiang</h3>
<p>After returning to China, I stayed in Shanghai several times. Every time I went out, I had to rely on public buses. Therefore, I have a considerable understanding of public buses. On the second day of my arrival in Shanghai, I bought a new map of Shanghai to facilitate my travels because I was not familiar with Shanghai's traffic. However, the map did not explain the bus routes in detail, so it was useless. Later, I asked friends about the situation of the various bus routes, and I learned a little. One day, I wanted to take a public bus from North Sichuan Road to Jing'an Temple. My friend told me to take bus number 1. So I waited at the bus stop for a while and saw a public bus speeding towards me. I remembered that several buses passed by here, so I had to look clearly before I could. So I watched the number on the front of the bus or the destination sign from a distance. But what I saw on the sign was neither the route number nor the destination point sign. It was a bright advertising sign for Mei Lanfang brand cigarettes. At that time, I was afraid of taking the wrong bus, so I didn't dare to get on. So I waited for the second bus. A few minutes later, another bus came. It also had a transparent and bright advertising sign with the words "Eckefa Photographic Materials" on it. I hesitated several times and still didn't dare to get on. I waited for the third bus to come. At that time, there was no way. I had to ask the waiting passengers where the number was. I was pointed to a dark and unclear number printed on the lower right corner of the front of the bus. This time, I finally discovered the continent like Columbus. I was overjoyed. I saw that it was indeed number 1, so I boarded with confidence. I paid the fare and arrived at my destination safely. Recalling this time, if a number 1 or the words "Jing'an Temple" had been placed on the advertising sign on the front of the bus, I wouldn't have hesitated for so long. I hope that the public bus authorities will pay special attention and improve as soon as possible so that passengers can easily identify the routes of each bus and feel a lot of convenience. You must not sacrifice the original purpose for a small amount of advertising revenue. In addition to clearly marking each route number on the front of the bus, you can make it easier for passengers from other places and those who are not familiar with the routes so that they do not feel difficult. This is my discussion on the public buses in the concession. I hope that the authorities will understand and investigate. Now I am posting the London public bus number for reference.</p>

<h3>Recent Situation of the Hunan Provincial Highway Bureau - Xue Qian</h3>
<p>Hunan Province has had a highway bureau since the second year of the Republic of China. Subsequently, the China and Foreign Famine Relief Committee and the first, second, and third automobile bureaus of Hunan successively built and operated roads. In the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, the government realized that road administration must have an overall plan. Therefore, in September of that year, it was decided at a joint meeting of the Party and the government to take over the province's affairs and establish a preparatory committee for the Hunan Provincial Highway Bureau. Personnel were dispatched to take over the roads in different ways. The Hunan Provincial Highway Bureau was established in November. Up to this year, the entire process of the bureau can be divided into four points, which are described as follows.</p>
<p>Highway Plan After the establishment of the Provincial Highway Bureau, the original road construction plan was divided into seven major trunk lines and thirteen branch lines. The trunk lines are the Xiang-Guangdong, Xiang-Guangxi, Xiang-Guizhou, Xiang-Sichuan, Xiang-Jiangxi, and Xiang-Hubei east-west lines, with a total length of 4,820 li. They are to be completed in four phases. The branch lines are the Yuan-Heng, Chang-Hong, Chang-Zhi, Hong-Wu, Wu-Ling, Ling-Ru, Cha-Qi, Gui-Ling, Liu-Ru, Yin-Shou, Chang-Lin, Ning-Xiang, and Li-Shi lines, with a total length of 8,669 li. They are also to be completed in four phases. However, the progress of the project depends entirely on the transfer of funds. Now, the Highway Bureau has formulated the following plan for this year based on the current financial situation. (1) The roads to be completed this year are the Chen-Yi section of the Xiang-Guangdong line, the Huang-Gao section of the Xiang-Hubei east line, the Heng-Hong section of the Xiang-Guangxi line, the You-Cha section of the Liu-Ru branch line, and the Tao-Gao section of the Xiang-Guizhou line. (2) The roads to be built this year are the Hong-Yong section of the Xiang-Guangxi line, the Xiang-Qiao section of the Xiang-Sichuan line, and the Gao-Ping section of the Xiang-Hubei east line. (3) Organize two survey teams to survey the Bao Road of Tao-Hong and Tao-Yuan sections respectively. (4) Establish management offices in Hong-Wu and Tao-Yuan. (5) Complete the station houses, road sheds, bridge equipment, etc. for the roads that have been opened to traffic.</p>
<p>Construction Funding The estimated funding for this project is an additional unified tax of about 1.2 million yuan per year, an additional salt tax of about 120,000 yuan per year, a business surplus of about 500,000 yuan per year, and a provincial treasury subsidy of 1.5 million to 3 million yuan per year. Unexpectedly, since the military uprising, the provincial treasury has not been able to fully distribute funds, and business income and various surcharges have also been unable to reach the estimated amount due to the impact of the war. Therefore, road construction funds are becoming increasingly scarce. After Changsha was captured again, public and private finances were bankrupt. After the abolition of customs duties, there was no source for the additional unified tax. The problem of road funds has become even more difficult to raise. It is estimated that since the establishment of the Highway Bureau, as of the end of April this year, the income from the two batches is still more than 100,000 yuan short.</p>
<p>Completed Routes The routes that have been completed in Hunan Province include seven lines. (1) The Chang-Heng section of the Xiang-Guangdong line, from Changsha through Xiangtan Hengshan to Hengyang, is 317 li long. The Heng-Chen section, from Hengyang through Laiyang Yongxing to Chen County, is 247 li long. (2) The Tan-Bao section of the Xiang-Guizhou line, from Xiangtan through Xiangxiang Yongfeng to Taohuaping in Shaoyang, is 478 li long. (3) The Chang-Chang section of the Xiang-Hubei west line, from Changhe through Ningxiang Yiyang to Changde, is 304 li long. (4) The Heng-Quan section of the Xiang-Guangxi line, from Hengyang to Quanhai, is 61 li long. (5) The Li-You section of the Liu-Ru branch line, from Liling to You County, is 139 li long. (6) The Chang-Tao section of the Chang-Hong branch line, from Changde to Taoyuan, is 61 li long. (7) The Chang-Shui section of the Xiang-Jiangxi line, from Changsha to Yong'an City, is 54 li long. The Huang-Gao section of the Xiang-Hubei east line has also been completed, from Huanghua City to Qujia. The eleven li of it, a total of more than 1,680 li of completed roads. The Chen-Yi, Quan-Hong, You-Cha, and Qu-Gao sections are all 70-80% completed. If road funds are available, they can all be completed and opened to traffic in the near future.</p>
<p>Business Situation At the beginning of the establishment of the Highway Bureau in Hunan Province, there was unprecedented ice and snow for decades, and vehicles could not travel. It lasted for more than two months. After April, the anti-rebellion army was launched, and the vehicles on each road were reduced due to the daring to transport the army. The impact on business was even greater. When the Guizhou army entered Hunan, the number of military vehicles increased and they were damaged. After the Guizhou army left, the Red bandits came again. The administration of the entire province was suspended for nearly a month. The red atmosphere was everywhere, and travelers were warned. The business income was naturally unspeakable. Since May of this year, floods have caused disasters, and the routes on each road have been flooded. In particular, the Chang-Chang and Chang-Tao sections have been flooded for a long time. The roadbed and vehicles have been particularly damaged. Business is becoming increasingly affected. It is estimated that from the date of establishment of the Highway Bureau to July of this year, the average monthly income of each section is more than 65,000 yuan for the Tan-Bao section, more than 25,700 yuan for the Chang-Heng section, more than 13,800 yuan for the Heng-Chen section, more than 7,600 yuan for the Li-You section, more than 15,200 yuan for the Chang-Chang section, more than 5,300 yuan for the Chang-Tao section, and more than 7,600 yuan for the Chang-Yong Gao section. The total average monthly income of all sections is about more than 140,000 yuan. This is due to the impact of natural disasters and man-made disasters in recent years, and some places have almost no income. Subsequently, the situation is becoming more stable and the social economy is gradually recovering. In addition, the Highway Bureau is keen to reorganize business. Currently, the total monthly income can reach more than 190,000 yuan in peak months and more than 130,000 yuan in off-peak months. There will be further improvements in the future.</p>

<h3>Demonstration Group</h3>
<p>— Gold</p>
<p>This month, the 17th was the day of the Shanghai secondary school students' general demonstration. I got up early, ate some snacks, and hurried to school.</p>
<p>"(Mister Gold,           )" Xiang, who liked to speak English, asked me as soon as he saw me.</p>
<p>"(Brother, please don't translate into English, I really am...)" I replied to him uninterestingly.</p>
<p>"(Mister Gold, today is the day of the secondary school students' general demonstration. The notice was posted a long time ago. Are you going?)"</p>
<p>"(I, I want to go, what about you?)"</p>
<p>"(Of course I'm going.)"</p>
<p>...The sound of footsteps rang out, and rows of classmates began walking towards Zhonghua Road.</p>
<p>"(Sigh, truly hateful, what demonstration is it again?)" Yu, whose grades were often in the nineties, said unhappily.</p>
<p>"(You really don't know what's good for you. How happy is a strike? You don't have to study during the day, and you don't have to review at night. You play all day long. Think, how rare is this kind of day?)" The mischievous Hui搶着 said.</p>
<p>"(You are all wrong. I hate going to class the most, and I don't think it's good to march without class. You walk all day long, and you don't even rest. I'm afraid if you walk for a few more days, your legs will be straight. In my opinion, it's best to sit in the room, play the piano, and sing songs. When you have nothing to do, go to the cinema to watch a movie. Isn't this the best way?)" Huang, nicknamed Olive Head, also joined their conversation.</p>
<p>"(Right or wrong, we don't need to worry about it now, but we have to discuss the slogans, because the other teams are already shouting enthusiastically. If we don't shout a single sentence and just have a conversation, we might be too sorry for people.)" Yu said unhappily.</p>
<p>"(Okay, I elect Yu as the captain.)"</p>
<p>"(No, I elect Huang as the captain, because the sound he shouts out is like a tiger's roar and can excite people.)"</p>
<p>"(I elect……………)"</p>
<p>After a while, they吵得吵得了不得 over each other's sentences... Fortunately, the volunteer corps of the乂 school came and dispersed our conversation group, and also elected a captain to lead us to shout slogans. Our slogans were (Urge the government to immediately send troops to resist Japan.)</p>
<p>(Vigorously implement revolutionary diplomacy.)</p>
<p>(The whole nation compatriots arm themselves.)</p>
<p>(Prepare for war against Japan.)</p>
<p>(Down with Japanese imperialism.)</p>
<p>(Long live the Republic of China.)</p>

<p>Book Review</p>
<h3>Rice, Cotton, Yarn Qin Jiannan</h3>
<p>Commodity Series, First, Second, and Third Compilations</p>
<p>Compiled by the Shanghai Bank Investigation Department</p>
<p>The greatest mission of ordinary banks lies in assisting and developing industry and commerce. To assist and develop industry and commerce, one must first understand industry and commerce. Only by understanding industry and commerce can one assist its progress, and only by improving its management can one live up to the trust of the general depositors in society, and only then can one be considered a true bank. In the past ten years, China's banking industry has developed rapidly. Theoretically, industry and commerce seem to be prospering day by day. However, the decline of industry and commerce in the past ten years is a visible fact. Most banks are nothing more than agencies for trading in public bonds. They simply do not have a major relationship with industry and commerce, let alone a very reasonable relationship. When lending money, they are like money shops, looking at the property of the owner and listening to the manager's bragging. They do not bother to understand whether the fixed amount is reasonable and reliable for the commodities or businesses they are engaged in. Since they are unwilling to fully understand the nature of industry and commerce, the extent of their assistance to industry and commerce is naturally very limited. The abnormal state of banking development and the lack of development of industry and commerce over the years has also resulted from this.</p>
<p>Shanghai Bank, based on its purpose of serving society and assisting industry and commerce, issued a series of commodity publications this year, and has already published three types: rice, cotton, and yarn. It is truly worthy of our great admiration that this kind of work can be carried out by an ordinary bank. Because the compilation and printing of this kind of series is not necessarily a money-making business, the bank is not dazzled by the short-sighted problem of making money, and is able to issue this kind of series. Regardless of the value of its work, the work itself shows the bank's determination to thoroughly understand industry and commerce and its preparation to actively assist industry and commerce. If this kind of spirit can become a trend in the banking industry, and more attention can be paid to the promotion of industry and commerce instead of making a living by trading in public bonds, then China's industry and commerce will surely make great progress. Not only will boycotting Japanese goods be completely effective, but the entire national economy may also be greatly improved. The bank's publication of this series is of considerable significance, and the content of the series is concise, the narration is clear, the materials are rich and orderly, and it is really worth reading. Therefore, I will introduce it as follows:</p>
<h3>I. Rice</h3>
<p>The first book in the commodity series is rice. We eat rice every day, but how many kinds of rice are there? Perhaps only those who run rice shops or rice stores can answer. Therefore, the first section of this article talks about the types of rice in Shanghai, and attaches the chemical composition of various types of rice, so that we can know which is the best rice to eat every day. The second section describes the supply and demand of rice in Shanghai, and revises the estimates of the Shanghai Grain Commission. According to the book's estimates, Shanghai needs about 5.6 million shi of rice per year, and the supply is the same. Among the rice supply, the amount of foreign rice is the largest, but what the port needs is not foreign rice, but japonica rice. There is a paragraph in it ("The Tragedy of Rice"), which is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(Although there is a lot of foreign rice arriving, most of it is transshipped to other places. The standard of living in the port is higher, and the quality of foreign rice, which is inferior to japonica and indica rice, is not very popular except among the poor. Most of those who patronize it are japonica rice, which can be seen in its sales volume. However, farmers in the interior who grow japonica rice, because the price of japonica rice is expensive and the price of foreign rice is cheap, 反糶 sell japonica rice and eat foreign rice to earn a small profit.)</p>
<p>The third section discusses the transportation of rice, detailing the cost of transporting rice from the interior or from foreign countries to Shanghai, and the procedures for fixing rice in foreign provinces or countries. The fourth section describes the transaction of rice in Shanghai—that is, the rice industry. The rice industry is divided into the following types: (1) rice brokers or rice dealers, (2) rice retailers, (3) rice firms, (4) rice stores, and (5) rice mills. They are explained separately. There is also a detailed description of the transaction of rice from foreign provinces and foreign rice, and the operation of rice mills in Shanghai. The fifth section describes the finance of the rice industry in Shanghai, dividing the industry into three items: financial transportation finance and seasonal rice industry finance. The description is quite detailed regarding its source of profit, the risks it bears, and so on. The sixth section describes the accounting of the rice industry in Shanghai. The seventh section describes the price of rice in Shanghai, first describing its long-term trend, then describing its seasonal changes, and then describing the reasons for its rise and fall. The last paragraph describes the driving force behind the rise and fall of rice prices in Shanghai, which is quite wonderful. An excerpt is as follows:</p>
<p>(...Since there are many types of rice, what kind of rice is the standard for its rise and fall? From a general observation, it is special japonica. When the price of special japonica rises, the prices of various grains of rice also rise. However, in reality, special japonica only accounts for 20% of japonica rice, which is not a large number. Now, a small number of rice commands a large number of rice, as if it represents the majority of rice. How can it be said that the strange rise in rice prices in Shanghai in recent years is the fault of special japonica? The consumers of special japonica are the wealthy class. The price of rice can rise as much as possible without them worrying about it. However, other rice also rises with it, and the general public suffers greatly. Therefore, in recent years, some people have banned the import of special japonica as a way to balance rice prices.)</p>
<p>The eighth section describes the organizations of the rice industry in Shanghai. The ninth section, the last section, describes the direction of improvement of the rice industry in Shanghai, dividing it into three points: (1) From the commodity itself, there are too many types of rice in Shanghai, and the most expensive rice is not the best in nutrition. The most expensive rice is often special japonica. In fact, the nutritional value is not as good as brown rice, and only seven or six dou of rice can be obtained from one shi during milling, which is a lot of waste. Therefore, the government should classify rice and stipulate the milling standards of rice mills. (2) In terms of buying and selling habits, there are too many sub-industries in the rice industry, and there are many drawbacks in transactions, such as mixing japonica rice with indica rice, adding water, using light dou and冲斛,暗盤貼價,昂佣, etc. The way to improve is to supervise by the government on the one hand, and to encourage each other by the industry on the other hand to strive for innovation. In addition, the lack of new-style rice warehouses or rice docks is also a shortcoming in the rice industry, which should be created as soon as possible. (3) In terms of finance, the method of consignment and mortgage should be promoted to facilitate the turnover of funds in the rice industry.</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>Demand, can naturally help its balance.</p>
<p>In addition to the main text, there are also various appendices, such as a list of rice stores, rice firms, rice retailers, foreign rice sellers in Shanghai, a rice price index table for Shanghai over the past sixty years, a Shanghai japonica rice price table, a comparison table of rice production areas 斛 and Shanghai 斛, a foreign rice import table for sixty-two years, and a table of important rice-producing areas in the country. These are all good reference materials.</p>
<p>(II) Cotton</p>
<p>The organization of this article is the same as the previous article, that is, it is divided into the above sections: (1) Types of cotton in Shanghai, (2) Supply and demand of cotton in Shanghai, (3) Transportation of cotton in Shanghai, (4) Transaction of cotton in Shanghai—cotton industry, (5) Finance of the cotton industry in Shanghai, (6) Price of cotton in Shanghai, (7) Cotton industry organizations in Shanghai, and (8) Direction of improvement of the cotton industry in Shanghai.</p>
<p>In ("The Supply and Demand of Cotton in Shanghai"), there is a paragraph that is very noticeable. It is estimated that the demand for cotton in Shanghai is more than 4.9 million dan, and the supply is more than 5.3 million dan. However, in this huge supply and demand, in terms of the demand for cotton in Shanghai, Chinese-owned yarn factories are not as large as Japanese-owned yarn factories. In terms of the supply of cotton in Shanghai, Chinese cotton is not as large as foreign cotton. The former is a symbol of the guest being more important than the host, while the latter is a sign of agricultural bankruptcy. Such hidden dangers are worthy of great concern.) China, which is based on agriculture, actually has this phenomenon. It can be seen that industry and commerce are indeed lagging behind, and agriculture is not necessarily outstanding. The urgent need to promote China's cotton industry can be seen from this.</p>
<p>This article discusses the transportation of cotton in Shanghai in great detail. It describes in detail the preparations for transporting cotton (i.e., packing), the route and costs of transportation, the customs declaration and warehousing procedures for imports and exports, and the quantity of imports and exports. It can be used as a reference for those engaged in the cotton industry. The transaction procedures in the cotton industry and the finance of the cotton industry are also analyzed in detail. The last section, on the direction of improvement of the cotton industry in Shanghai, is the most exciting part of this article. First, it discusses the defects of the cotton industry in Shanghai, dividing it into three aspects: (1) In terms of cotton itself, its shortcomings are (A) too little production and insufficient supply, (B) quality degradation, (C) uneven quality, (D) inconsistent packaging, and (E) lack of statistics. (2) In terms of the cotton industry itself, its shortcomings are (A) many malpractices, such as adding water, mixing cotton seeds or seed cotton, mixing low-grade cotton, mixing cotton lint and waste cotton, and mixing mud and sand. (B) Inconvenient transportation, (C) Foreigners run cotton businesses, and Chinese people cannot get involved in good-quality cotton. (D) Foreigners monopolize cotton import and export trade, and (E) There are too many middlemen. (3) In terms of the finance of the cotton industry, its shortcomings are (A) lack of capital, and (B) Failure to fully utilize new credit methods. The ways to improve are also divided into three points: (1) On the government side, it should (A) promote cotton planting, (B) implement inspection, and (C) establish cotton statistics agencies. (2) On the cotton industry side, it should (A) establish large-scale transportation and sales companies, (B) establish packing factories, and (C) build cotton warehouses. (3) On the financial side, it should (A) support large-scale cotton transportation and sales agencies and (B) promote cotton consignment and mortgage. Each point is explained in detail, and it can be a good reference for the cotton industry.</p>
<p>After the main text, there are also various reference materials, such as a list of the cotton industry in Shanghai, a table of prices for American and Indian cotton, a table of worldwide and Chinese cotton production, inspection rules of the Cotton Inspection Office of the Commodity Inspection Bureau, and the bank's domestic consignment remittance rules. The material is substantial, showing the bank's attention to the cotton industry. (To be continued)</p>
