<h3 id="c24">國難中敎育界應有之自覺 <a href="#c24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>敬告大學校當局</p>
<p>昨日一評。吾人已以誠摯之言辭。勉勵國内大學生切實荷負其求學致用之責矣。今請更向大學校當局貢其蒭蕘。</p>
<p>洪水驟臨。舉國束手外侮突至。朝野失色旣無以禦自然之禍變。復無以抗强鄰之侵襲。如肉陳爼。坐待宰割。我民旅衰老無能積弱不振之弱點。至此已暴露無餘矣。曩者國人尙以地大物博人衆之文明古國强自解嘲而今則何如者地雖大而半没洪流。物雖博而民皆凍餒人雖衆而死亡纍積。此日之鉅難。更隱伏他日之危機。然而國内歌舞之聲。猶不絕於耳。娱樂之羣。逹日不休。對此慘刦。漠不動心。（商女不知亡國恨。隔江猶唱後庭花。）吾人誠不解我民族何以墮落衰頽一至此極。</p>
<p>彼暮氣已深行將過渡之國人吾人已不能對其存若何希望矣。將來之一線希望即繫於今日之大學生。如何敎育大學生。如何訓練大學生。使其成爲我國家將來之健全柱石。以復興我民族。振興我國家。此鉅大之重責即全在大學校當局之身何以言之。大學敎育。爲一國之最高級敎育。作育人材。樹立風氣。皆在於是。現在之大學生。即他日支撑我國家之柱石。未來中國之命運。即决斷於今日之大學敎育。故大學敎育。即爲立國之基礎而今日在學學生。都爲健全純潔之青年。尙未沾染積重惡習眼前悲慘事實之剌激。更易激起其發奮蹈厲之雄心。但使一念轉涙。决意奮起。則我國前途。光明正自可期。獨是（十年樹木。百年樹人）（種瓜得瓜種頭得豆。）如何爲國家樹植人材。如何爲未來社會播植良。種欲收良果必種善苗。大學校當局即今日播植種子之農夫。他日果實之爲佳爲劣。我國家前途之爲盛爲衰。即全繫於今日之播植。是則大學校當局肩上所負荷之責任。其艱鉅果爲何如乎。</p>
<p>今日學校當局一談及敎育輒曰政治未上軌道。學生好亂成性敎育自難收良好之效果。是誠然矣。然而否否。吾人與其諉過於人毌寗先求其在己。先盡已責。乃能責人。先正己身。乃能正人。試一檢閱近數年來敎育界之現象。一校之内。派系分歧。爭持傾軋。各不相下。利用學生爲爪牙。聨絡顯逹爲奥援。視學校如官署。視校長如官缺。敎育至此尙堪問乎。次之今之大學校長。或則異地遥領。或則兼長數校。校長不理校中之事。學生不識校長之面。校長成爲官僚化。等敎育如兒戲。視責任如鴻毛。一校之長尙且如此。其他尙堪問乎。復次。學校敎授。大都一渡重洋。讀書數載。即若有無限學問。取之不竭。用之不盡。不更求進益。徒視敎書爲衣食工具。或目爲做官之階梯。弱者則浮沉取容。强者則播弄風潮。己不能正焉能正人己不能立。焉能立人爲之師者如此。而欲望其學者遵循正軌。勤其所業。是何能得。上有好者。下必有甚焉者。以故學生中之意志薄弱者。即沉湎放浪。徵逐於電影跳舞之場。其優秀而怨憤内積無可宣洩者。乃挺而走險。趨於歧途。頻年以來。國内學潮。彼伏此興瘴氣一團。學風蕩然。敎育破產。誰爲爲之。孰令致之不以自責。輒曰政治未上軌道。學生好亂成性。是眞明於責人而暗於責己者矣。敎育所以改良社會。今敎育本身。尙日夕呼籲槍彈之彈壓與維護。其欲以之樹人材。正風氣。爲國家建立新基礎。是何能得。吾人言此。固非抹殺一切。敎育界儘有自好盡責。視敎育爲終身事業者。但如上所述。要亦爲陳現於吾人之眼簾不可掩飾之事實也。</p>
<p>過去已成過去。與其顧後。毌寗瞻前。當此國家大難。民族慘刧。從前種種。切應痛自悔艾。身任何職。即應盡其本分正己以正人立己以立人。勤勤懇懇。務求踐實。時時以國難爲念。時時以國家與民族之前途爲念。時時以自身難鉅之責任爲念毌以一己私利。貽誤青年。且誤國家。則敎育前途。庶有轉機。民族前途。或尙有望。逆境當前。禍福自擇。吾人其各沉痛覺醒。毌甘作國家與民族之罪人。</p>

<p>此外尙有若干文件、頗足引起我等之興趣、易言之、即從該若干文件中顯示中國尙未受共黨搗亂若何盛大之影響、蓋共黨報告中、供認自内部分裂爲左傾·右傾·機會主義·取消主義·托洛斯基主義·李立三路綫·幹部派等派别、後加以最近本黨之加倍努力、在全國三百萬產業工人中、受彼輩之影響者、不過二三千人、此千分之一之產業工人、不過各爲赤色工會會員而已、而在產業最發逹之上海、彼輩不能發生絲毫作用、由此即可想見因共黨之没落、連帶而生的職工運動之衰弛、其他如福建西部紅軍之反對共黨、鄂東紅軍之慘敗、紅軍軍事長官之不聽政治局指揮、紅軍軍事發展、超越共黨黨務之發展、農民運動之流寇化、在在顯示第三國際在中國搗亂之高潮已成過去、而日見其低落</p>

<p>江北水災臨時義賑會第一救濟隊於上月三十日由省出發、本月五日上午九時返鎭、爲程計共一週、此次原以調查興東一帶水災、並散放急賑爲目的、嗣因到興化後所携賑品、略一散放、即已無餘、又裝載數百難民在船、事實上不能再赴東台、故在興工作結束後、即行返鎭、據隊長柳君報告、沿途所經各地及興化一帶災况如下、</p>
<p>（一）沿途水災狀况就沿途所經各地災况比較、可分三段、一爲興化永安間、水勢最大、災况亦最重、一路水天相連、汪洋浩瀚、不知有幾千萬頃、舟行其中、如入太湖、僅有樹頭蕩漾水面外、餘無所見、蓋人畜飄流、廬舍蕩析、已勢等陸沉、雖難民悽厲之呼救聲、至此亦欲聞而不可得、施賑亦無從施起、哀哉、永安一鎭、受災最酷、全鎭數百之生靈、盡行淹没、祇入鎭橋口一家、巍然獨存耳、二爲喬墅以北眞武廟楊家莊邱墅閣一帶、災情雖較前次重、然景况則甚慘居民有搭屋樹際者、有直立屋脊上者、側耳惟聞呼救聲、輪隊行駛時、居民竟不避危險、紛紛駕小舟逐浪、隨輪乞賑、甚者駕一小板或木盆前來、男婦老幼、擁擠一處、跪者揖者、哭聲震天、皇皇然祇求一食、景象之慘、有生所未見、眞武廟一帶、人民多露宿圩岸上、無處避風雨、岸亦僅與水平、稍有風雨、危險即下堪設想、每一輪來、難民齊立乞賑、每段人數不下千人、所携賑糧杯水車薪、不濟於事、祇有忍痛鼓輪快馳、三爲喬墅以南仙女鎭邵伯一帶、災况較輕、四野良田亦成爲巨浸、然尙有陸地可見、居民房屋雖有被水冲毁者、然半數尙有屋可居、有物可食、較之以上各地、已不可同日而語、仙女鎭兩岸已高出水面數尺、可無問題、邵伯當大水時、勢極危險、大街亦有水三四尺、全鎭長僅三里許、而被水冲倒之堤岸、如六閘孫鷄毛帚南大王廟官驛前士馬頭等有十餘處之多、該鎭原有米市及楊木匠巷以北市街、皆被冲毁無餘、淹斃人口約三百餘、損壞房屋約二千間、到處頽屋危垣、蕭條景象、慘不忍覩、現水勢低落、全鎭已脫險境、地方人士正在努力整頓中、鎭北一帶堤岸、亦正由二十五路軍派有兵工築路隊修築、由邵而南災况則尤輕矣、以上各段災况比較、完全由揚至興一路觀察所得、總之水初大發時、高邵一帶首當其衝、受災慘重、待至車南新三壩開放、運河東岸各處及昭關壩北一帶决口時、水勢均直趨下河、傾洪澤高郵邵伯三湖之水、源源下貫、鹽阜興泰東等地勢窪下、又無可宣洩導引入海、勢不得不成爲澤國、故就現在水勢言、裏下河一帶災况、實重於上河各地、亟應設法救濟、據有水利經騐者言、現欲救濟下河水災、應乘此水退流緩之際、在運河東岸各處搶險堵防、并迅速設法開掘范公堤、疏通卯酉河、引水入海、下河一帶或可有救、否則將成一片大湖、亦不可知也、</p>

<p>此次中國水災、幾遍全國、爲空前所未有、生命財產之損失、豈只億兆、而中國上自政府、下至平民、均朿手無策、徒呼奈何、可憐一般人民、旣有内戰之擾、復有水災之害、政府旣用全力剿匪滅共、自是吾人所欽佩、吾人亦盼政府用全力與水災奮鬥、誰謂人力不能勝天耶、</p>
<p>人人皆知下雨太多、但是何以偏偏在中國下雨一多、就成大害、其他如日本落雨亦多、何以不致成災呢、豈天之厚於人、而薄於我耶、蓋其中自有原因在也、其原因爲何、即森林之講究與否是、</p>
<p>中國不但没有森林、即間有之、木未長成、即被砍伐、一層是人民之任意摧殘、二層是政府對於已有之林、不加保護數千年來如此、所以中國就成爲世界上缺乏森林之頭等國家、童山千里、不見一樹、結年旣久、地質變壞、而一般人還在夢中未醒、</p>
<p>何以中國下雨一多、就成大害呢、譬如一個山陂、所有的樹木、已被我們砍伐乾盡、到了夏天時候、落雨過大、雨水由上落下有種重力、結年旣久、山陂之面、已被水滴築緊、不能儲蓄水量、因此全部雨水、即依山陂流下、且同時石塊·土壞·細沙·等等、亦被山陂水冲動同水流去、因此水之流動、速度增高、則成所謂一種可怕的急流、何以可怕呢、因爲（一）他不但可以冲毁堤岸、并且可毁滅吾人所種之農田、及所住之房屋、（二）可使河床增高、對於航行、危險頗大、（三）使平原肥沃可耕之地、舖滿沙石、變爲不毛矣、</p>
<p>換言之、没有森林、地面不能儲畜水量、所落之雨、全部變爲急流、向河中流去、河道不能在短期中、將各處驟聚之水消去、又加大雨繼作、因此水面增高、水災成矣、水災旣成、農田已毁、民食無着、飢饉乃至、如水災之後、必有飢饉、此爲千古不易者也、明乎此、則知我國水災之所由來矣、</p>
<p>今再談何以日本（歐美列强亦然）下雨頗多、不致成災呢、這就是他們森林講究之結果、今特將其究竟一述、就以上的取響、假若我們將這山陂空地、從事造林、并且假設此山陂已變成森林、到了夏天落大雨的時候、試問又是怎樣的呢、當然水患可以减輕、若果全國的森林講究得很好、水患可以完全消減的、何以故呢、</p>
<p>（一）因爲闊葉樹類森林之枝與葉、可以吸收三分之一的水分旨樹類森林（日本最多）之枝與葉、可以吸收二分之一的水分、過後這些枝葉等所吸收的雨水、又發散在空中去了、至於枝葉不能吸收之過量雨水、則流入地中、</p>
<p>（二）在未說流入地中之水之先、應說說森林下面之地質、因爲我們旣有森林、而每年冬季所落於地面之葉枝等、漸次變乾、第三年亦然、以至每年冬季、所落之葉、均蓄地面、所以地面積有一厚層樹葉層、此樹葉層、有兩種功效、一、下層樹葉腐化、與土混合、則成黑土、可作肥料、復使地變沃、給樹木營養之需、二、對於雨水、此種樹葉層、有一種海綿性、能容多量之水、并且吸收與他本質重五倍或六倍甚至九倍之水量、所以流入地中的水、被樹葉層吸去頗多、</p>
<p>（三）俟樹葉層到飽合狀態、又有一部水分被陽光蒸發、其他則點點流入地下、變爲泉水、</p>
<p>（四）至於最少量不能容納之水、則向他處流去、但在他所經過的道上遇着了窮的障碍、不遇着樹幹樹枝、即遇着蘇苔及其他草本植物、不遇着地下之樹根、即遇着樹葉層等、這些障碍物、有漏斗的功用、他可使水慢流、且能將石沙等與水分開、至最後最少量不能容納之水、以最慢速度、流入河中、因此河床不致增高、河水不致高漲、有時稍漲、亦無所害也、</p>
<p>換言之、若講究森林、不但森林可用去大部雨水、并可使多量雨水、成爲緩流、雖大雨繼作、河水能從容流去、農田旣得以灌溉、人民亦豐衣足食、是以國家之富强文明、森林之講究、是一最重要原素也、</p>
<p>其他可以發生水災者、就是雪化、山中積雪、冬季不化、若無森林、春夏熱雨或陽光、與雪完全接獨、故融化較快、有水災之虞、若有森林、則其樹枝等、可以阻碍與雨水或陽光、完全接觸、雪化較慢、水災不易成矣、</p>
<p>由上看來、森林與水災的關係、何等的重要、歐美各國、森林向來頗爲發逹、政府尙繼續不斷的提倡造林、一層是歐美工業發逹、所須木材太多、二層是有時還有小小水災、故不斷的鼓勵造林、歐美各國之注重民命、於此可見、然造林一事、非一朝一夕所能成功、古人云、十年之計在樹木、余獨以爲未足也、若政府欲從事造林、今其時也、不然、此種水災、當層出不窮、國脈危矣、（寄自法國南錫）</p>

<p>久别返滬之我國網球聖手林寳華、曾於九月四日、在時報上發表、中華網球前十傑一則、所列次序、頗欠週詳、其所語雖非正式、然影響事實甚巨、因此種言論、缺乏一種事實上之證明、且其所舉之十傑、皆從愛惡中寫來、爲予國人以切實之認識、故不忖冒昧、申述如次、</p>
<p>（一）地點之狹也林君所論之十傑、均限於北平、天津、上海、星埠、四地耳、何能包括全國二字、况華南素產英才、網球界現赫赫有名者、大有人在、何得任其遺珠、</p>
<p>（二）事實上之欠缺也林君在間接中、自居首席、降抑他人、實予人一種反感、况現在坐前三把椅子之好漢、非重經過一種實地上比賽、甚難定論、若徒憑往昔勝邱一戰、置已身於首席、居邱飛海於中、屈林望蘇於後、其爲不公可見、憶當日雙林之戰、（林寳華於未戰邱飛海之前、與林望蘇對打、林望蘇連勝兩盤居先、天黑未完、後林寳華因他故、未曾畢賽、）林望蘇大有戰勝林寳華之可能、若邱林（望蘇）相較、則林遠不如邱、（歷年星埠各項比賽、林望蘇祗曾勝邱飛海一次、餘則屢戰屢北、）故目下前三位之次第、實爲一大懸案、其餘如、</p>
<p>高惠民高氏雖係北平聖主、但技術平平、無甚特長、曩在全國分區比賽時、高曾表華代北、在滬一現身手、但均爲華東諸將所敗、今林置其於第四席、似欠根據、且類高氏之球技、國中較其優超者甚多如香港之羅文惠、吳仁光、廣州之高熾熏、星埠之蔡春良、（譯音）林約翰、</p>
<p>高氏實非敵手、</p>
<p>鄭兆佳鄭爲新進好手、年少英俊、前程無量、惜今年病胃、鮮於練習、惟按其程度擊法而論、仍屬在幼稚時代、編入十傑榜内、尙非其時、查去年全國運動會時、鄭曾代表上海市出席於杭州、初賽中即爲浙選手陳乃新所敗、檢查其過去成績、除在津得有學生單打冠軍、並去歲與林寳華獲華人公開雙打錦標外、無他顯著成績、林謂其曾大敗江道章、實係錯誤、亟宜更正、</p>
<p>江道章江君體碩、故動作時、稍覺遲慢、其技藝雖未逹爐火純青之候、但目下正竿頭日進、豈可謂其黄金時代已成過去、觀此次江在扶輪杯賽中、戰坎之利德、日之町田二役、可爲鐵證、今林屈其於高鄭二子之下、豈不怨哉、</p>
<p>餘子若吳少香梁寳奎等、雖全爲後起之秀、惟國内技藝、與彼輩相等者、處處皆是、倘列併於第一流名手中、是好惡之論矣、不佞年雖而立、向嗜網球、技雖不精、然積十餘年之經騐、身歷各地與各名手、有深刻之交游、自料有一得之愚、因敢於林君所談之十傑次序、有所商榷、以合事實、非有謗妬於林君也、茲將不佞所舉之十傑、列之於後、所見諸網球界同人未知以爲然否、尙乞有以敎之也、</p>
<p>（一）林寳華（次第未定）</p>
<p>（二）邱飛海（次第未定）</p>
<p>（三）林望蘇（次第未定）</p>
<p>（四）蔡春良（Chua　Choon　Leong）註當邱飛海在星埠連得馬來羣島錦標三年時、蔡屢爲亞軍、又一九二五年曾敗菲島第一名手亞力根於菲列濱、</p>
<p>（五）羅文惠香港去年公開單打冠軍、</p>
<p>（六）江道章</p>
<p>（七）吳仕光</p>
<p>（八）林約翰</p>
<p>（九）馬熾熏十九年杭州全國運動會單雙打錦標、</p>
<p>（十）高惠民或何家鎏</p>

<p>對此問題方案之發表、惟若後者亦有去之可能或必要、敢請敎以如何進行之法、（須關於專研究社會科學者）如坊間現有可供參考之書出賢者亦請示知、</p>

<p>經營進出口生意、正如君函所言、必須有相當之專門知識與技術、不能冐昧從事、在今日中國、待做之事極多、君應就本身之所長、擇定一事、先從極小的範圍按步就班去做、不必騖遠、尤不可計速效、</p>

<p>黛玉葬花詩裏說：（一年三百六十日，風刀霜劍嚴相逼。）這是中國普通人對於一年的觀念。秦西人民從埃及以及到現在都說一年三百六十五日。其實，這種通常的口頭語都是不正確的。地球繞太陽一周所需之時間是三百六十五日五小時四十八分五十秒。我們現在已改陽曆，對於這五天五小時四十八分五十秒的零頭自然不可再像從前那樣忽略。埃及人和羅馬人當初只算一年爲三百六十五天把零頭略去。弄得差之毫厘，失以千里。每四年便差一天，四十年便差十天，四百年便差一百天。日積月累四季都弄顚倒了。到了該撤的時代，時令差了八十天光景。他在公元前四十六年把它糾正過來。這年他定了十四個月，四百四十五天，是歷史上最長的一年。這是補足從前缺欠的辦法。從這年以後，他定了每四年閏一天，把這一天加在二月的日數上。羅馬風俗二月只可有二十八天，雖該撤之專制也不敢擅改，所以平常年份的二月總是二十八日。其他月份月大三十一日。月小三十日。閏年照現在看來是二月有二十九天。但是照羅馬人的說法這增加的一天是稱爲三月前一日，不稱爲二月二十九日，所以羅馬人的二月二十八日的風俗便补該撤騙過去了。該撤之後，曆書爲主敎Pontiff所管。他們把曆法弄錯，三年一閏。三十六年中多閏了三天。奥古斯都Augustus爲他糾正過來。他是一位好名的人，見着七月July是因該撤得名Julius　Caesar而且是月大；他用自己的名字稱呼八月August，且改月小爲月大，致使月份大小次序受他搗亂。但是該撤所定四年閏一天的辦法，未免長了一點。因爲四個五時四十八分五十秒只有二十三時十五分二十秒。每年多算十一分十秒，在一百二十八年便要多算了一天。一年一年的堆積起來到了格列高里第八Gregory　VIII（一五八三年）已經多算了十天。他於是把一五八三年的十月五日定爲十月十五日一直推到年終。爲了使以後不致再發生這種錯誤，他規定凡世紀年Century　Year如一九○○，二○○○，二一○○，二二○○是删去最後兩個圈，用四除得凈的閏一天，除不凈的不閏。這樣一來，四百年中便减了三個閏年。但是格列高里第八的改正還不能算澈底，因爲在一萬年中還有兩三天的錯誤。</p>

It is reported that the first shipment will be wheat flour. Song Ziwen has instructed the Flood Relief Association to entrust various Shanghai warehouses to store and transfer the flour to the disaster areas. It is also planned that domestic mail steamers will provide free transportation. (Special dispatch from the 7th)</p>
<p>Zhuang Songfu of Nanjing stated that rumors of opposition from the Legislative Yuan regarding the loan for disaster relief are untrue. The borrowed grain will meet the needs without being wasted.

Over 200 people broke through and fled to the southeast towards Tai'an, while the rest scattered. However, they seemed to be avoiding attacks by government troops in a planned manner. The headquarters has again telegraphed Ma Hongkui, stationed in Tai'an, and Gu Liangmin, stationed in Yanzhou, to quickly dispatch troops to intercept them and prevent them from fleeing back to their old lair in the mountains of Feixian. Furthermore, the remaining Liu troops in Guan County have become local bandits. They have been severely attacked by various armies and fled to Lijin and are being pursued.

<p>Striving Diligently Within My Capabilities</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Xueliang telegraphed Chairman Chiang on the 5th in response to the Eastern Telegram, with the original text as follows: To Chairman Chiang in Nanjing, Having read your telegram of September 1st, I am deeply moved by your profound concern for the country, your thorough self-reproach, your demonstration of impartiality to the world, and your consideration for the hunger and drowning of the people. Upon hearing it, I am filled with admiration. I believe that the nation is in great difficulty, suffering frequent internal strife and external insults. The flames of the Red menace are spreading, poisoning several provinces. It was only through Your Excellency's laborious efforts that the suppression was nearing completion, yet who would have thought that natural disasters would follow, with floods inundating vast plains, turning them into giant swamps, the misery of death and displacement being appalling. In our weak and declining nation, with the lives of the people hanging by a thread, we are faced with a situation of extreme difficulty. All those under the rule of the Republic of China, unless they are foolish and guilty, should reflect deeply in time, pool their wisdom and efforts, and seek to extricate themselves from the raging waves. Moreover, having repeatedly received Your Excellency's exemplary guidance and sincere exhortations, those with any conscience should not turn a deaf ear. Xueliang has always been obedient and concerned about the danger. He loyally supports peaceful reunification. To the best of his humble judgment, he has also telegraphed the entire country, calling for mutual assistance. I now receive your earnest admonition, which I will follow. I will strive diligently within my capabilities. I respectfully submit my humble sentiments for your consideration. Zhang Xueliang bows respectfully. (5th) Secret seal at noon.

<p>Our Country's Representatives Participating in League of Nations Work</p>
<p>(Nanjing)</p>
<p>During the Ministry of Foreign Affairs memorial week on the morning of the 7th, Wang Zhengting reported that the League of Nations meeting would be held this week. A telegram has been received from the three representatives of our country, stating that they have arrived in Geneva. Our country has a chance of being elected to the League of Nations Council this year. This League of Nations meeting will provide much assistance to our country's diplomacy. With more opportunities for the representatives to meet with the prime ministers and foreign ministers of various countries, our country will also have the opportunity to engage in work with the League of Nations. In recent years, the League of Nations has sent commissioners to China to investigate and guide economic, industrial, health, labor, and other affairs, providing much assistance. Our President Wang also participates greatly in international work as an international judge. This spirit of international cooperation is something that all countries should have. He also said that he recently heard Chairman Chiang report at the National Government that the communist bandit strongholds have all been broken, but they are now running around aimlessly, forming roving bandits. Historically, suppressing roving bandits is truly not easy. Li Hongzhang spent ten years of effort to suppress the Nian bandits, and Yuan Shikai spent two years to eliminate the White Wolf, which shows how difficult it is. Now, suppressing the communist bandits will not take as long, but this is related to internal affairs. If internal affairs are prosperous and police administration is developed, then all bandits and roving communists will naturally not last long. Regarding the incidents in the two Guangdong provinces, the central government has always taken a lenient approach, hoping they will realize their errors. However, for the sake of the overall prestige of the country, force must be used as a last resort. (Special dispatch from the 7th)</p>

<p>The Dalai Lama Proposes Three Conditions</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the Sino-Tibetan dispute, the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission is making optimistic propaganda to calm things down. According to external reports, the Dalai Lama has proposed conditions: (1) Troop withdrawal must occur after a treaty is signed, and both sides must do so reciprocally. (2) The issue of the Sino-Tibetan border should be submitted to the League of Nations for public judgment. (3) The location of the Sino-Tibetan conference, originally set at Chamdo, cannot be changed. Tang Kesan has no solution. (It is noted that the Dalai Lama's request for the Sino-Tibetan border issue to be decided by the League of Nations is a serious problem. If the League of Nations resolves the issue based on the principles of covenants (the expansion of nationalism and the premise that the right to govern should be based on the consent of the governed), it would not be beneficial to us.) (Special dispatch from the 7th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the Sino-Tibetan issue, progress is gradually being made.

According to reliable sources, on the 6th, he telegraphed Lei Zhongtian and Ma Wanche, ordering them to promptly restore Ma Hongbin's freedom so that he can exercise his powers and to prevent the use of force against Ma Tingxiang's troops in Longnan to maintain peace in the Northwest. (Special dispatch from the 6th)</p>
<p>(Xi'an) Yang Hucheng received a telegram on the 3rd from Ma Lin, acting chairman of Qinghai Province, and Ma Bufang, a division commander, forwarding a telegram from representatives of all circles in Ningxia, containing over a thousand words of statements regarding the Gansu affairs, requesting Yang to forward it to the central government, ordering Lei Zhongtian and others to release Ma Hongbin back to Ningxia so that political changes would not lead to ethnic issues.

<p>(Nanjing) Liu Yufen telegraphed Lei Zhongtian, stating that he had received verbal instructions from the Commander-in-Chief that Ma Wanche would be solely responsible for the Gansu incident, ordering him to detain and supervise him and restore Chairman Ma's freedom.

Considering your position, you are at the forefront of the situation. Even if my heart is clear, it is difficult to gain the understanding of others. Since the central government has shown leniency and provided room for maneuver, I hope you will dispel all doubts, make a decisive decision, and handle the matter separately according to the central government's telegram. Your future can be advanced from this point on. (Special dispatch from the 7th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Yang Hucheng telegraphed Ma Fuxiang, stating that according to Ma Wanche's telegram of the 4th, he had discussed with Division Commander Lei and sent Chairman Ma Hongbin back to his private residence, restoring his freedom. However, regarding the exercise of his powers, based on the environment, it is difficult to convince the people of Gansu. Wanche is very willing to obey the orders of the central government and maintain the authority of the central government. However, due to the trend of public opinion, he has no power and cannot go against the will of the people. His efforts are sincere but insufficient. He is currently maintaining order and waiting for the central government to resolve the issue. From the telegram, it appears that Chairman Ma has not yet been released. In addition to strictly ordering Ma Lei to comply with the previous telegram, a special telegram is sent for your information. (Special dispatch from the 7th)</p>

<h3 id="e24">Self-Awareness That the Educational Community Should Have Amid National Crisis <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>A Respectful Admonition to University Authorities</p>
<p>In yesterday's commentary, we sincerely encouraged university students in the country to earnestly bear the responsibility of learning and applying their knowledge. Today, we would like to offer our humble opinions to the university authorities.</p>
<p>The sudden arrival of floods and external aggression has thrown the entire nation into disarray. The court and the common people are dismayed. There is no way to resist the disasters of nature, nor can we resist the invasion of strong neighbors. Like meat on a chopping board, we await slaughter. The weaknesses of our people—old age, incompetence, accumulated weakness, and stagnation—have been fully exposed. In the past, the Chinese people were still able to comfort themselves with the civilization of an ancient country with vast lands, abundant resources, and a large population. But what is the situation now? Although the land is vast, half of it is submerged by floods. Although the resources are abundant, the people are starving and freezing. Although the population is large, death is accumulating. This great difficulty of today conceals the crisis of tomorrow. However, the sounds of singing and dancing in the country have not ceased. The group of entertainers does not rest every day. They are indifferent to this catastrophe. ("The singing girls are unaware of the grief of a fallen nation, still singing songs of pleasure across the river.") We truly do not understand how our nation has fallen into such a state of decline.</p>
<p>As for the people of our nation who are deeply immersed in a dying spirit and about to pass away, we can no longer place any hope on them. The only glimmer of hope for the future lies in the university students of today. How to educate university students, how to train university students, so that they become the sound pillars of our country in the future, to revive our nation and revitalize our country—this great responsibility rests entirely on the shoulders of the university authorities. Why do we say this? University education is the highest level of education in a country. It cultivates talent and establishes a social atmosphere. Everything depends on it. The university students of today are the pillars that will support our country in the future. The fate of China in the future depends on the university education of today. Therefore, university education is the foundation of the country, and the students studying today are healthy and pure youths. The stimulus of the tragic facts before our eyes is more likely to arouse their ambition to be diligent and courageous. But if they change their minds and resolve to rise up, then the future of our country will be bright. However, ("It takes ten years to grow a tree, but a hundred years to nurture a person.") ("You reap what you sow.") How to cultivate talent for the country, how to sow good seeds for future society? If you want to reap good fruit, you must plant good seedlings. The university authorities are the farmers who sow the seeds today. Whether the fruit will be good or bad in the future, and whether the future of our country will be prosperous or declining, depends entirely on the planting of today. Therefore, how arduous is the responsibility that the university authorities bear on their shoulders?</p>
<p>Today, when school authorities talk about education, they always say that politics is not on the right track, that students are prone to troublemaking, and that it is difficult for education to achieve good results. This is certainly true. However, should we first seek the cause within ourselves, fulfill our own responsibilities before blaming others, and correct ourselves before correcting others? Let us examine the phenomena in the educational community in recent years. Within a school, factions are divided, fighting and undermining each other, and each refuses to yield. They use students as pawns and connect with prominent figures as support. They treat the school as a government office and the position of president as an official vacancy. Can education in this state still be asked about? Secondly, today's university presidents either remotely lead from other places or concurrently lead several schools. The president does not manage the affairs of the school, and the students do not recognize the president's face. The president has become bureaucratized and treats education as child's play, regarding responsibility as light as a feather. Even the head of a school is like this. What else can be asked about? Furthermore, the school professors mostly cross the ocean, study for several years, and then act as if they have unlimited knowledge, inexhaustible and inexhaustible. They do not seek further advancement but simply regard teaching as a means of clothing and food or as a stepping stone to becoming an official. The weak flatter and accommodate, while the strong manipulate the situation. If one cannot correct oneself, how can one correct others? If one cannot stand, how can one stand others? Teachers are like this, so how can one expect the students to follow the right path and be diligent in their studies? Those above like something, and those below will do even more. Therefore, those with weak wills among the students indulge in debauchery, pursuing movies and dancing. Those who are excellent but have resentment accumulated internally and cannot vent it take risks and go astray. For years, domestic student movements have been rising and falling, and the atmosphere of learning has disappeared. Education has gone bankrupt. Who is responsible for this? Who caused this? They do not blame themselves but always say that politics is not on the right track and that students are prone to troublemaking. They are truly clear about blaming others but ignorant of blaming themselves. Education is meant to improve society, but today education itself is still calling for suppression and maintenance by guns and bullets. How can it be used to cultivate talent, rectify the atmosphere, and build a new foundation for the country? We say this not to negate everything. There are many in the educational community who are self-respecting and dutiful, regarding education as a lifelong career. However, as mentioned above, these are undeniable facts that are presented before our eyes.</p>
<p>The past is the past. Instead of looking back, it is better to look forward. At this time of national crisis and national catastrophe, all past mistakes should be deeply regretted. Whatever position one holds, one should fulfill one's duties, correct oneself to correct others, and establish oneself to establish others. Be diligent and conscientious, striving to be practical. Always keep the national crisis in mind, always keep the future of the country and the nation in mind, and always keep in mind the responsibility that one bears. Do not mislead young people for personal gain, and do not mislead the country. Then the future of education will have a turning point, and the future of the nation may still be hopeful. In the face of adversity, one chooses one's own fortune and misfortune. Let us all wake up with grief and remorse, and not be willing to be the sinners of the country and the nation.</p>

<p>Romanian Representative Elected President</p>
<p>French Foreign Minister Briand Personally Attends</p>
<p>▲National News Agency Geneva dispatch on the 7th. The 12th International League of Nations Assembly opened this morning with the opening ceremony conducted by Spanish Foreign Minister Lerroux, Chairman of the Council. Mr. Lerroux delivered a speech, praising the League's activities and achievements in the international arena, and its positive influence in striving to achieve a European Federation. It has not only helped Europe to overcome the current economic crisis, but also has been very active in South America and Asia, especially in promoting health and anti-smoking cooperation, which has been most successful. Subsequently, the election of the President took place. Representatives from several countries proposed Count Albert Apponyi, an 84-year-old Hungarian statesman, as the most suitable candidate, but France and the Little Entente strongly opposed it. Finally, Romanian Prime Minister Titulescu was elected with 25 votes out of 49 electoral votes. This time, Argentina and Honduras were the only two countries that did not send representatives to attend, and other South American countries also sent only one representative each, which also shows the rise and fall of the League of Nations' influence in the Western Hemisphere.</p>
<p>▲National News Agency Geneva dispatch on the 7th. The most important items on the agenda of this League of Nations Assembly are the issues of disarmament and economic recovery. There are also the re-elections of non-permanent council members from Spain, Persia, and Venezuela. It is expected that, in addition to Spain, which currently holds a semi-permanent position and is expected to be re-elected, China may be elected in place of Persia. The full agenda is as follows: (1) Election of the President and Secretary, selection of committees, and adoption of the agenda; (2) Report on the League's work over the past year; (3) Election of three non-permanent council members; (4) Compilation of the International Legal Code; (5) Discussion of preparatory procedures for negotiating international conventions; (6) Elimination of conflicts between the League's Charter and the Kellogg-Briand Pact; (7) Proposal to designate the Hague International Court as the international arbitration court of appeal; (8) Organizational issues of the Secretariat, the International Labour Bureau, and the secretariat of the Hague Court; (9) Election of Supervisory Committee members; (10) Criminal administration report of the Secretary-General; (11) Committee for Consideration of the European Economic Federation; (12) Convention on improving methods for preventing war; (13) International Bureau for Military Disaster Refugees; (14) World Report on Abolition of Slavery; (15) Nationality of women after marrying foreigners; (16) Work of the Economic and Financial Departments; (17) Work of the Communications and Transportation Department; (18) Work of the International Health Department; (19) Work of the Advisory Committee on Opium and Dangerous Drugs; (20) Work of the Advisory Committee on the Protection of Women and Children; (21) Intellectual Cooperation; (22) Convention on the Protection of Whales; (23) 1932 Budget; (24) Work of the International Educational Cinematographic Institute in Rome.</p>
<p>▲National News Agency Geneva dispatch on the 6th. French Foreign Minister Briand arrived here today. According to Mr. Briand himself, he came to Geneva this time because there were rumors outside that he was seriously ill and unable to get up, so he came here specifically to provide proof to the contrary. Mr. Briand's spirits are excellent, and he answered all kinds of personal questions asked by reporters in detail, but he did not talk about politics at all. In addition to talking to ex-Prime Minister Scialoja of Italy and Russian Foreign Commissar Litvinov, Mr. Briand is said to be participating in the General Assembly of the League of Nations, while the Council meeting of the League of Nations will still be chaired by Finance Minister Flandin as the chief representative of France, because Mr. Briand does not want to be involved in the whirlpool of the dispute over the German-Austrian Customs Union again. As for what kind of disputes the German-Austrian Customs Union issue may cause after the Permanent Court renders its verdict, it is still unknown, because Germany and Austria, with the consent of England and Italy, advocate that the Council of the League of Nations should only acknowledge the verdict of the Permanent Court, while the French delegation still insists that there must be a formal debate.</p>

<p>New Leader of the Labour Party Publishes an Article</p>
<p>Believes Old Comrades Organized a New Cabinet</p>
<p>Driven by a Sense of Responsibility</p>
<p>▲Reuters dispatch on the 7th, London. The Labour Party's official newspaper, the Daily Herald, published this morning that those in the new Labour Party cabinet who made this decision were indeed motivated by faith and a sense of responsibility. Labour Party members in the House of Commons will not make personal accusations against these old comrades when it reconvenes. Although Henderson said this, there is no doubt that the Labour Party is determined to fight. One of the most serious weeks in British political history since the war is about to begin today. According to recent estimates, the new government can get a majority of fifty or sixty votes in the House of Commons vote tomorrow. The Labour Party refers to this situation as a war between workers and financiers. Although the former Minister of Commerce, Graham, is an Edinburgh economist, he also firmly believes that the organization of the national government is a direct result of pressure from the foreign financial community. However, the authorities firmly deny this view. The new cabinet will meet once this afternoon. Parliament will reconvene tomorrow, and the House of Commons can vote to express its confidence in the new government before about midnight.</p>
<p>▲Reuters dispatch on the 7th, London. The Dobbies Union held a regular meeting today and passed a motion by a vote of 103 to 48 to cancel Thomas's eligibility to be a Labour Party candidate in the election district. However, there was no expression of personal hatred at the meeting place, nor was Thomas asked to resign from his seat in Parliament. Thomas himself attended the meeting in person and rose to speak at the end of the meeting, praising the audience's attitude during the discussion and saying that he had served the Dobbies constituency for a long time. Although the constituency has decided that it does not want him to be a Labour Party candidate in the next election, he has no grievances. Who is right and who is wrong will be known in the future. He is willing to serve Dobbies again, but according to what he knows, a general election may not be held until after the crisis has passed. According to reports, Thomas has been a Dobbies Labour Party member of Parliament since 1910, for a total of 21 years.</p>

<p>Kindness Comes from Nature</p>
<p>Patriotism Inspires Admiration</p>
<p>The Silence of All Things Praises Hymns</p>
<p>Sleeping on the Deck with the Blue Sky as a Tent</p>
<p>▲Reuters dispatch on the 6th, London. Indian National Party leader Gandhi is on his way to England by British ship to attend the Round Table Conference. According to a telegram from a Reuters correspondent on the same ship, Gandhi is very happy on the voyage. His actions are like a student traveling for the first time. He often plays with children, strokes the young and weak, and laughs and talks with their parents. This morning, Gandhi, wearing a loincloth, joined the Christian worship service, which surprised the onlookers. When the ship was sailing on the river and sea, and all things were silent, Gandhi followed the Christians and sang the hymn (Guide with Compassionate Light). Today, the Reuters correspondent asked what kind of clothes he would wear after arriving in England. Gandhi replied that if it is cold, he would wear a thick wool fabric, which is ankle-length, with a self-woven white shirt. Gandhi gets up very early in the morning, usually at 4 o'clock every morning, and sleeps on the deck with the sky as his tent. During the day, he reads and writes, or talks with companions and fellow passengers. He must spin yarn every day, regarding it as a religious ritual, which he never interrupts. Gandhi never refuses anyone who wants to take his picture, so many people take pictures with a quick camera. He also readily grants those who want to ask for his autograph. Gandhi's food is simple, and his main food is boiled goat's milk, so the ship always has this item on hand. Many places in England and Wales are willing to provide goats for Gandhi, and there will definitely be no shortage of this supply when Gandhi arrives in England in the future.</p>

<p>Inukai Tsuyoshi is Old but His Heart is Not</p>
<p>Strongly Advocates Using Force as a Backing for Diplomacy with China</p>
<p>▲Denstu Agency dispatch on the 7th, Tokyo. The political war for local elections is in full swing, and the Seiyukai party and the government are now focusing all their efforts on the election battle. The lobbying groups dispatched by the headquarters to various places have begun their activities. Prime Minister Wakatsuki attended the Rikken Minseito party's Hokuriku conference in Toyama City on the 5th and has since personally participated in political battles in various places, chanting the policy platform of the current cabinet and unveiling new topics such as 50 million yen in low-interest loans and the issuance of rural unemployment bonds to appeal to local voters. As for the Rikken Minseito party headquarters in Tokyo, Interior Minister Adachi is responsible for guarding the fort, planning strategies based on reports from local branches and local officials. As of noon yesterday, the Seiyukai party had only 149 candidates, while the Rikken Minseito party had 279 candidates. Interior Minister Adachi believes that establishing too many candidates will lower the election rate and affect morale, so he is very careful in his selection, aiming to have 1,000 candidates elected.</p>
<p>▲Denstu Agency dispatch on the 7th, Tokyo. The Seiyukai party is facing active attacks from the Rikken Minseito party and is also making strong war preparations. Recently, the headquarters has urged local branches to carefully select candidates and monitor the oppression of government officials. As a result, it is confident that it can compete with the government and the Rikken Minseito party. The Kumamoto conference on the 8th will be the last local conference, and it will then enter the second phase of the political war.</p>
<p>▲Denstu Agency dispatch on the 7th, Kozufu. Inukai, the president of the Seiyukai party, along with advisor Tokonami and several members of parliament and party members, set off westward from Tokyo at 1:00 PM to attend the Seiyukai party's Kyushu conference in Kumamoto. In the car, he said that in Manchuria and Mongolia, unlucky incidents have occurred repeatedly.</p>

<p>Matters, negotiations have stalled, which is extremely worrying. This time, the Chinese side's attitude towards the Nakamura incident is quite arrogant, which is due to the current cabinet's weak diplomacy. Recently, Prime Minister Wakatsuki has also become gradually tougher, but I am afraid that no one trusts him. Perhaps he was forced by the military and is just a cornered rat biting the cat. If diplomacy cannot be resolved and national strength must be resorted to, then it is the responsibility of the current cabinet. Regarding financial issues, the current cabinet has not implemented a single fact in its agreement with the people. Recently, Interior Minister Adachi and Agriculture Minister Machida are advocating abandoning the non-debt raising principle, probably because the budget cannot be compiled, so they are doing this. The fate of the current cabinet's policies has reached a dead end.</p>
<p>▲Denstu Agency dispatch. The Proletarian Party has decided to adopt the first principle of verbal warfare in its strategy against established political parties, arousing the national public. The National Labour-Farmer Masses Party, led by Aso Hisashi, Oyama Ikuo, and others, and the Social Democratic Party, led by party leader Abe Isoo and member of parliament Katayama Tetsu, are lobbying local areas, chanting about the economic downturn after the lifting of the gold ban, publicizing the poverty of the masses, exposing the tyranny of capitalists and landlords, and awakening the national proletariat so that they will rise up in response. As for officially recognized candidates, the National Labour-Farmer Masses Party has 20, and the Social Democratic Party has 15, which are expected to be elected.</p>

<p>A Wave of Strikes is Brewing at Home</p>
<p>The Future of the Political Situation is Unpredictable</p>
<p>▲Reuters dispatch on the 6th, Santiago, Chile. The Chilean government had planned to cut naval salaries twice, which the navy opposed, eventually leading to a mutiny. The government tried to mediate, but the rebels refused to comply. Today, the government sent aircraft to bomb the rebel ships anchored at Coquimbo, which is 220 miles north of Santiago. The bombing was reportedly very heavy, and the cruiser Lautaro has been sunk, while the rebels on the battleship Almirante Latorre have now surrendered.</p>
<p>▲Reuters dispatch on the 6th, New York. A fast telegram from Santiago, Chile, was received here tonight, stating that government troops and naval rebels fought today at the port of Talcahuano, 270 miles south of Santiago, with 1,000 deaths. Another telegram reported that according to the Chilean government's latest report, there were only 50 deaths in the battle at the port of Talcahuano, but 1,000 prisoners were taken. Most of the fleet is still in the hands of the rebels.</p>
<p>▲National News Agency dispatch on the 6th, Santiago, Chile. The Chilean navy has mutinied again, and the communists are also threatening to cause incidents. The Chilean interim government has difficulty coping. Currently, the situation in and around Santiago, Chile, is extremely chaotic, with many contradictions. The wave of strikes is also surging endlessly, and the authorities are finding it particularly difficult to deal with the army and navy personnel. Therefore, the future of the government is difficult to predict.</p>

The French government specially sent the Director-General of Aviation to hold a victory memorial ceremony here. At that time, German General Kluck crossed the Marne River on September 3 and advanced victoriously towards Paris. Joffre waited for reinforcements to gather and ordered a counterattack on the 6th, thus blunting his advance. The old taxis that transported reinforcements from Paris at that time are still on display in the memorial hall. According to reports, this town went through two major wars in 1914 and 1918, but today everything has been restored, and there are few traces of destruction left.</p>

<p>Bartering Goods</p>
<p>▲National News Agency dispatch on the 6th, Berlin. Due to the current financial crisis and lack of cash in Germany, all trade is gradually trending towards bartering goods. Farmers not only pay taxes with agricultural products, but also exchange goods for daily necessities. Therefore, local government offices have accumulated a lot of inventory, waiting for the government to decide whether the subsidies for unemployed workers can also be paid in goods in the future. Furthermore, the steel trust recently stated that the coal accumulated in the various coal mines in the Ruhr area has reached more than 9 million tons, so it plans to contact the Dutch authorities, willing to exchange this inventory of coal for vegetables and food from the Netherlands. However, farmers in Germany have expressed opposition to this plan, because if this plan can be established, the livelihoods of German farmers will fall into an increasingly difficult position. Moreover, the German government has not yet expressed its permission for this matter, so it is feared that it will be difficult to achieve.</p>

<p>To all newspaper offices in Nanjing: Hunan has suffered a terrible flood, and the entire province has been affected. The areas along the lake have been flooded by the overflowing rivers and lakes, and the mountain counties have been flooded by flash floods. Villages and houses have been washed away, and the disaster-stricken people are starving and waiting to be fed. Autumn is already deep, and hunger and cold are pressing. Fortunately, the government has repeatedly issued relief funds, which have temporarily alleviated the crisis, but the future is long, and there are many concerns. Yaozu and others are using their limited strength to provide a small amount of assistance, but they have the heart to save people from drowning but cannot turn the tide. We still ask all charitable organizations and major philanthropists to use their generosity to provide benevolent broth and righteous grains. Every bit of grain and cloth is a great kindness, and abundant streams and thick grace will surely benefit the people. We dare not waste the good intentions. We hereby express our sincerity and ask for your understanding. He Yaozu, Lü Bichou, Chou Ao, Jiang Chuou, Wang Zhijue, Yang Xiji, and Zhou Aoshan, standing committee members of the Hunan Flood Relief Association in Beijing, bow in reverence.</p>

He then briefly outlined his findings and thoughts. Regarding the shortcomings in Party affairs, he noted that most Party members only knew about ordinary work within the Party and did not pay attention to the necessary external movements. They only took on the Party's name, and were not very clear about the Party's responsibilities and all regulations. There was little contact between Party members and the public, their spirits were dispersed, and disagreements easily arose. As for the social aspect, the situation was very complex. Party officials only knew to generally reject bad and corrupt elements, and could not find ways to influence and correct them, making it difficult to eliminate reactionary forces and impossible to develop Party affairs. Regarding military affairs, whenever the Red bandits launched an attack, the Party headquarters and local people were extremely panicked and fled. Although there were civil defense organizations in various counties, their strength was weak. Furthermore, because the bandit suppression troops were sparsely distributed, it was difficult to lead various self-defense groups to mount a strong defense. Therefore, the bandits who fled from Jiangxi were able to wreak havoc in northern Fujian, and the local people suffered greatly. An investigation revealed that most of the bandits in Fujian were local bullies, with very few true Red bandits. When they first arrived, they preached communism, and many people were hypnotized by them. Later, they changed their faces, robbing, plundering, burning, and killing everything. By this time, even if the people wanted to resist, they could not. From this point of view, it was due to the failure to fully develop military efficiency, but more importantly, the Party headquarters and Party members had failed to effectively carry out the work of influencing and leading the people. Therefore, in the future, all comrades who handle Party affairs should take leading society as a prerequisite for their work, earnestly assume the responsibility of propaganda and training, and work hard towards the people. This is not only the case in Fujian, but all Party members in various parts of the country should understand this principle. The meeting adjourned after the report.</p>
<p>▲At 10:00 AM on the same day, the National Government held a weekly memorial service for the Premier. Chiang Kai-shek, Yu Youren, Zhu Peide, Ye Chucang, Wang Zhengting, Wang Boqun, Ma Fuxiang, Lian Shenghai, Zhou FoHai, He Yaozu, Lin Xiang, Ru Yuli, Wei Daoming, Chen Yi, Chen Shaokuan, Gao Weiyue, Zhang Wohua, and more than 300 staff members from the National Government's civil service, military affairs, accounting, and other departments attended. Chiang Kai-shek presided over the meeting. After the ceremony, Chiang reported on supervising the suppression of bandits and inspecting the flood situation, stating that the work of suppressing the Red bandits in Jiangxi Province had not slackened in the past two months. The soldiers at the front were enduring hardship, which was even more painful than that of the flood victims. Now, thanks to the efforts of the soldiers, the main force of the Red bandits has been defeated, and all bandit nests have been eliminated. This can be reported to the people. Rumors of failures in bandit suppression are all reactionary fabrications. Although there are still remnants of bandits fleeing east and west in Jiangxi Province, he is confident that if Guangdong does not obstruct them, the problem can be completely resolved soon. Recently, it has been reported that Guangdong and Guangxi have sent troops to the Chenzhou area of Hunan, hoping to take advantage of the Yangtze River flood and the imminent elimination of the Red bandits to confront the Central Government, collude with imperialists, and receive supplies of guns and ammunition. At a time when the Chinese people are washing away national humiliation, Guangdong is taking such actions, which shows that their conscience has been completely lost. Even if they were to win by chance, they would be spurned by the people, and the result would inevitably be failure. Regarding the flood problem, the disaster in Wuhan and northern Jiangsu is heartbreaking. Not only should government colleagues have a responsibility to alleviate the suffering of the people, but all citizens should also have this responsibility. We must work together with one heart to overcome this disaster and unite under the guidance of the Party to overcome this difficulty and maintain order. Next, he also expressed his views on the issuance of disaster relief bonds as follows: (At this time, when domestic and foreign troubles, natural disasters, and man-made disasters are pressing in, our Party comrades, entrusted with the heavy responsibility of the Premier, face the serious impact of the current situation. Only by being of one mind and one heart, with the spirit of abiding by the law, the determination to be responsible, and rushing towards the goal of saving the country and the people, can we overcome dangers and overcome great disasters. Zhongzheng has been on expeditions for months, and the order in the rear depends on the maintenance of the comrades in the Central Government, so that Zhongzheng has no need to worry about internal affairs and can concentrate on suppressing the Red bandits. This is not only what Zhongzheng personally appreciates, but also what the people of the whole country expect. The disaster relief bonds passed by the Legislative Yuan, with a total amount of 80 million, were passed by the Central Political Conference in full, without reducing it by a penny. The comrades of the Legislative Yuan are enthusiastic about disaster relief, and the Central Political Conference has never lagged behind. Moreover, there are currently no accurate statistics on the disaster victims in each province, and the disaster situation in each province is being actively investigated. If it is considered necessary in practice, the Central Government should continue to handle disaster relief by adopting all other effective methods in addition to issuing these bonds. This is the first point that Zhongzheng dares to report to the people of the whole country with responsibility. The Central Political Conference decided that the 80 million public bonds should be issued in installments, originally for the convenience of promotion, hoping to avoid losses of these public bonds in the market and reduce the actual benefits of the disaster victims. These public bonds are now decided to be issued in two phases. The first phase is 30 million, which will be issued within ten days, and before it is printed, the unused portion of the salt tax bonds issued last time will be fully advanced, and military and political expenses will be temporarily postponed. The second phase is 50 million, which will be issued before the end of the 20th year. This is the second point that Zhongzheng dares to report to the people of the whole country with responsibility. However, regarding the second point, I also hope that the Legislative Yuan will pass it as soon as possible. If it still insists on misunderstandings and makes it impossible to proceed with this case, the disaster victims who are on the verge of death will be greatly affected. Now, let me offer some contributions to the comrades on the nature and relationship between the five branches of the National Government, in the spirit of Party governance and the spirit of the rule of law: (1) The five branches exercise five powers, and these five powers are completely independent. However, the principle of independence has only one element: not to infringe on each other. For example, regarding the powers between the Legislative Yuan and the other branches, the comrades of the Legislative Yuan should not give up the powers belonging to the Legislative Yuan, and the comrades of the Legislative Yuan should also respect the powers belonging to the other branches. As for the powers of the Political Conference and the National Government, each branch should respect them even more, and should not come to violate our legislative spirit and Party governance system for the sake of something of a certain branch. Therefore, only by respecting each other can we be independently without harm. The designation of the public bond fund and the organization of the management committee are the powers of the Executive Yuan. The Central Government has issued public bonds more than once, and the precedents are all there, which cannot be erased. If we must cross the threshold of legislation and replace the Executive Yuan in cooking, and disrupt responsibilities, starting from the Central Government, it is by no means the original intention of the independence of the five powers. (2) The political system of our Party has a consistent spirit that cannot be obliterated. Violating this consistent spirit is tantamount to violating Party discipline. The Central Political Conference is the center of Party tutelage. The legislative procedure further clarifies the connection between the Central Political Conference and the Legislative Yuan. No matter which branch it is, it has no right to modify or resist and reject what has been decided by the Central Governance Conference. The amount of debt determined by the Central Political Conference for this disaster relief bond case is the same as the amount of debt originally determined by the Legislative Yuan, which is already consistent in general. If this kind of legal fact and comprehensive resolution cannot be understood, how is it different from having to tear up the legislative procedure and completely destroy the power of the highest political center? This is absolutely impossible. I think the comrades who clearly understand the Party's governance of the country and the political system of the National Government will definitely understand and will not misunderstand. (3) In addition to the mutual complement of the five powers and the consistent spirit, our Party has always had an important point left by history that can work together with one heart, that is, based on the collegial approach of mutual love and sincerity. Judging from the facts and the law, the National Government is now completely a collegial system. No matter which branch or department, it cannot force the government to agree to a proposal with the prejudice of one branch or one person and treat the National Government as a puppet. All important state affairs must be consulted first and then decided. Therefore, these decisions can be pleasant and harmonious and proceed smoothly. If the resolution of one branch must force other branches to be unable to, and even force the entire central government to be unable to, and even repeatedly delay the disaster relief bonds themselves, making the disaster victims wait to die, this is absolutely impossible. Moreover, the National Government Organization Law clearly stipulates that cases that cannot be resolved between branches should be decided by the National Government Conference. Therefore, the branches should respect the resolutions of the government. Based on the above points, I hope that the comrades of each branch will understand this point and dispel unnecessary misunderstandings. Therefore, I do not hesitate to speak frankly and make this report. The disaster victims who are waiting for relief while enduring death cannot wait for us to quibble and argue about right and wrong. The comrades of each branch should understand this difficulty and understand each other, hoping to achieve the goal of fighting together and completing the revolutionary responsibility. I am very fortunate.)</p>
<h3 id="e68">The Conspiracy of the Third International and Soviet Russia <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>(Continued from Part 1)</p>
<p>In addition, there are some documents that are of considerable interest to us. In other words, these documents show that China has not been as greatly affected by Communist Party sabotage as one might think. The Communist Party's reports admit that it has been internally divided into leftist, rightist, opportunist, liquidationist, Trotskyist, Li Lisan line, cadre faction, and other factions. In addition, with the recent doubled efforts of our Party, only two to three thousand of the three million industrial workers in the country have been affected by them. These one-thousandth of the industrial workers are only members of the Red Trade Union. And in Shanghai, the most developed city in industry, they cannot exert the slightest influence. From this, it can be imagined that the labor movement has declined due to the decline of the Communist Party. Other things, such as the Red Army in western Fujian opposing the Communist Party, the disastrous defeat of the Red Army in eastern Hubei, the military commanders of the Red Army disobeying the instructions of the Political Bureau, the military development of the Red Army surpassing the development of the Communist Party's Party affairs, and the banditization of the peasant movement, all show that the climax of the Third International's sabotage in China has passed and is declining day by day.</p>
<p>Of course, the total mobilization of our Party to intensify the suppression of the Red bandits has been sounding the death knell of the Communist Party. The subjective conditions of the Communist Party and the objective environment of China have been declaring the arrival of the end of the Communist Party. The content of these documents has revealed the Third International's aggression against weak ethnic groups. This cannot be said to be able to stop its further destruction of weak ethnic groups. Therefore, we should work harder and hope that the weak ethnic groups in the East will wake up as soon as possible and unite with our Party to form a united front to jointly attack the Red and White imperialism in order to seek the self-determination of independent survival. At the same time, we hope that the weak ethnic groups and oppressed people all over the world will deeply recognize the true face of the Third International.</p>

<h3 id="e70">Dumping of Russian Goods Endangers Northern Manchuria <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Total Imports of 22 Million in the First Half of the Year</p>
<p>State-Run Trading Branches Established in Various Border Areas</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: For months, the shops here have been panicked. The reason for the panic is the dumping of Russian goods, which has invaded Northern Manchuria and has become an overwhelming trend. The customs summaries of Suifenhe and Manzhouli before July 15 stated that the value of Russian goods imported in half a year was more than 22 million yuan. The staggering number has startled those who heard it. However, the border with Russia is thousands of miles long, such as Heihe, Tongjiang, Hulin, Mishan, and Dongning, Raodong, Suiyuan, and Luobei counties and towns, all have imports, but no one knows the value of them. Along the Eastern Railway, there are also mobile consumer cooperatives that sell goods by train, which has caused the Harbin merchants to feel extremely oppressed. All commercial markets have been destroyed as a result. Recently, Soviet Russia successfully purchased grain in the lower reaches of the Songhua River, and Harbin lost its economic center, and felt a greater threat. The merchants associations inside and outside the Daoli district have successively convened trade associations to study countermeasures. The only solution is to petition the government to restrict the import of Russian goods, but when the petition was submitted to the government, it was said that the Sino-Russian meeting was in the midst of negotiations, and it did not want to take decisive measures to cause disharmony between the two countries. However, there is no other good plan except to prohibit the import of Russian goods. The Special Police Management Office once agreed to collect a defense donation for Russian goods, and to add a 2.5% donation for every hundred yuan of value in addition to various regular taxes, in order to limit the smooth entry of Russian goods. After submitting the report to the Northeast Political Affairs Committee, it was rejected and instructed the Special Zone Administrative Chief Executive Office to discuss other laws. Until now, the Chief Executive Office has not yet replied. The so-called other law is actually difficult to imagine. A certain organization here recently reported to the Suifenhe police that Russia has recently established state-run commercial trading offices in various border areas, which will be the main agency for dumping goods to our border towns. Then Russia's sales plan will be carried out on a large scale, so the enlightened people in the business community recognize this as a very large crisis in Northern Manchuria. In two years, the trade of Northern Manchuria will be completely occupied by Russia. Recently, the two police offices in Te and Lu have respectively investigated the types and quantities of Russian goods exported and imported, and will report to the Chief Executive Office and submit it to the Central Government for approval to show the prevention policy. However, the Central Government has also heard of the dumping of Russian goods in Northern Manchuria for a long time, and has recently telegraphed the Chamber of Commerce to investigate and report, so as to decide on a plan.

<h3 id="e71">Five Counties' Disaster Victims Telegraph the Provincial Government to Order Mao and Li to Take Responsibility for Repairs <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>The Yancheng, Funing, Taixing, and Dongtai Disaster Relief Association stationed in the town telegraphed Chairman Ye, saying: To Jiangsu Provincial Government Chairman Ye Jun鑒, The collapse of the canal embankment is a catastrophe of immense proportions. The fault lies with the river affairs personnel, who failed to prepare in advance and fled completely afterward. Public opinion points to this, and there is no denying it. Previously, members of our association personally presented relief measures, which were entirely adopted by your government. You also expressed that if this is not handled well, you would have no face to face the central government again. This good news spread, and everyone was moved to tears. Later, we saw your personal inspection of the construction and the committee's repeated resolutions on various cases, all of which demonstrate sincerity. However, outsiders, unaware of the situation, have fabricated rumors about the penalty of dismissal and retention of Director Mao, claiming that the affected people are mostly dissatisfied. They do not know that the disaster was caused by him, and the lives and property of millions of people have been destroyed. Now, to have him reinstated to oversee repairs is only right. Unfortunately, the original plan did not include the words "responsible for repairs," so the river affairs personnel remain at large. In fact, confiscating the assets of these officials and assigning them to plug the breach would be enough. Now, we hear that these officials are trying every possible means to escape responsibility, as evidenced by Li Zhongqiang's undisguised joy at being ordered to be dismissed. We urge your government not to be misled by rumors and to order Mao Yisheng, Li Zhongqiang, and others to go to the construction site immediately and take responsibility for the repairs. This is the first request. Furthermore, your government has now hired Wang Shuxiang and others as members of the disaster relief committee. According to our association's telegraph of a few days ago, their role is only to guide. The responsibility for emergency repairs should still be borne by the original river affairs personnel. The original telegram can be reviewed. However, we hear that the Department of Construction intends to use this as an excuse to shirk responsibility. The breach-plugging project has not been actively carried out to date, which is disappointing to the people. Moreover, they are repeatedly blaming the flood on "the will of Heaven, which cannot be averted by human effort." Yesterday, we read in the newspaper that "Fifth Uncle" Tan and others discussed the aftermath of the project, stating that it would require at least ten million yuan and countless human sacrifices. Moreover, the land and sea are changing, and Shaobo Lake tends to shift eastward, which cannot be reversed by human effort. The decline of Shaobo Town is predetermined by Heaven. Although Chairman Ye will hire Wang, Wang's words are quite negative. After repeatedly reading this, our association feels that it is very unlike him. Your government's decision to hire Wang to join the disaster relief work must have been with Wang's prior agreement. Otherwise, why engage in empty gestures? As for the statement that the eastward shift of Shaohu is the will of Heaven and cannot be reversed by human effort, it sounds like the excuse of the Department of Construction and the current river affairs personnel to shirk responsibility. How could Wang, with his usual words and morals, echo them? Also, the breach-plugging project requires one hundred million yuan, a terrifyingly large sum, intended to keep the counties downstream submerged forever and to relieve the current river affairs personnel of their difficulties. Such a malicious psychology is surely not something Wang would say. There must be someone deliberately creating illusions and undermining the disaster relief plan. We urge your government to firmly carry out the original plan to save this great calamity. This is the second request. Furthermore, we were previously approved to distribute 100,000 yuan for emergency relief. Apart from the first distribution of over 30,000 yuan to various counties, when will the remaining 60,000 yuan be distributed? We urge your government to clarify this. This is the third request. The above-mentioned matters are of utmost importance. We earnestly request your immediate decision and a reply to comfort the people. We are immensely grateful. The Yancheng, Funing, Taixing, and Dongtai Disaster Relief Association stationed in the town respectfully presents this message.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Zhang Zhijiang's Reply to the Yancheng Reclamation Association Telegram <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>▲ There was no dispatch of troops to destroy the dykes of various companies. To the Joint Association of Yancheng Reclamation Companies in Northern Jiangsu: Your telegram has been read. The flood has caused disaster, and the people of several counties east of the canal are completely submerged, with deaths and displacement, which is deeply tragic. This office, mindful of the lives and property of the people, is doing everything within its power to rescue them. Every ordinary man and woman, every inch of land, is in our consideration. How could we destroy the salt farms without cause and disregard the lives of hundreds of thousands of tenant farmers? This time, the provincial government, in order to dredge the waterway to the sea in the Dongtai area, feared that the people on both sides might have misunderstandings and disputes, so it telegraphed this office to send a team to suppress them. This office, in order to maintain order, immediately sent a team. As for the dredging work, the provincial government has its own proper plans. If your association has any suggestions, you should directly submit them to the Jiangsu Provincial Government. Zhang Zhijiang (seal).</p>
<p>Attached is the telegram from the Joint Association of Yancheng Reclamation Companies in Northern Jiangsu to the Provincial Government: To Chairman Ye, Director He, Director Hu, and Director Sun in Zhenjiang: We have just received a telegram from the Dafeng Company, stating that the tenant farmers have been persuaded to comply with the order to open the Sanmao You River Dam. We also saw in the newspaper that the people of Jiangdu have requested Director Zhang to send troops to the company to forcibly remove the dikes. In the current situation, this association will never fight for the survival of the companies. However, the lives and livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of tenant farmers in the reclaimed land are at stake, and we cannot but consider them. Moreover, in recent years, the tenant farmers have become increasingly assertive and easily incited. According to a telegram from the Xiaohai Tongsuo Company, there have already been casualties in the fighting between farmers and tenants. The number of tenant farmers in Dafeng is particularly large. The company's eastern area is high and the western area is low, which has long been understood. It can be calculated whether the removal of the dike can reduce the flow of water in the three counties. Otherwise, the sea defenses have been removed, the autumn floods are imminent, and the saltwater will flood inland, leaving the tenant farmers with no hope of survival. The harm will not be limited to the company. This matter concerns the lives of the people, and any negligence will lead to disaster. In addition to appealing to Director Zhang to assess the situation and not allow the disaster area to expand, we are sending this special telegram to your government for review. Please take immediate measures, investigate in detail, and handle the matter carefully. In the current situation, this association has a responsibility to speak out, and our conscience is concerned. We are deeply worried about the disaster caused by the械鬥械鬥, and we cannot but make this request. We are all trying to save those who are drowning, and there is no room for selfishness. We ask you to weigh the two harms and choose the lesser. Chairman, your knowledge and talent are admired throughout the world, and your mind is clear and unbiased. We sincerely submit this message. The Joint Association of Yancheng Reclamation Companies,</p>

<h3 id="e73">Investigation of the Disaster Situation in the Xinghua Area <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Findings of the First Relief Team's On-Site Inspection</p>
<p>The First Relief Team of the Jiangbei Flood Relief Association set out from the province on the 30th of last month and returned to Zhenjiang at 9 a.m. on the 5th of this month, a journey of one week. The original purpose was to investigate the flood situation in the Xingdong area and distribute emergency relief. However, after arriving in Xinghua and distributing a small amount of the relief supplies, there was nothing left. Furthermore, with hundreds of refugees on board, it was impossible to go to Dongtai again. Therefore, after the work in Xinghua was completed, they returned to Zhenjiang. According to the report of Team Leader Liu, the disaster situation along the way and in the Xinghua area is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The Flood Situation Along the Way: Comparing the disaster situation along the way, it can be divided into three sections. The first is between Xinghua and Yong'an, where the water is the highest and the disaster is the most severe. The water and sky are connected all the way, a vast expanse of water, covering countless acres. Traveling by boat, it is like entering Taihu Lake. Only the tops of trees are swaying on the surface of the water, and nothing else can be seen. People and livestock are drifting, and houses are destroyed, as if they have sunk to the bottom of the sea. Even the desperate cries for help from the refugees cannot be heard. Relief cannot be provided. Alas, Yong'an Town has suffered the most severely. Hundreds of lives in the entire town have been drowned. Only one family at the bridge entrance remains standing. The second is the area north of Qiaoshu, including Zhenwumiao, Yangjiazhuang, and Qiushuge. Although the disaster is more severe than before, the situation is very tragic. Some residents have built houses in the trees, while others are standing directly on the rooftops. Only cries for help can be heard. When the relief team travels, the residents, disregarding the danger, drive small boats and follow the waves to beg for relief. Some even come on a small plank or wooden basin. Men, women, old and young, are crowded together, kneeling and bowing, crying to the heavens, desperately seeking food. The scene is the most tragic I have ever seen. The people in the Zhenwumiao area are mostly sleeping on the embankments, without shelter from the wind and rain. The embankments are only level with the water surface, and any wind or rain would be very dangerous. Every time a relief team arrives, the refugees stand together begging for relief, with no less than a thousand people in each section. The relief supplies they carry are a drop in the bucket, not enough to solve the problem. They can only grit their teeth and speed away. The third is the area south of Qiaoshu, including Xiannv Town and Shaobo. The disaster is relatively light. The good fields have also become a vast expanse of water, but there is still land to be seen. Although some residents' houses have been washed away, half of them still have houses to live in and food to eat, which is incomparable to the areas above. The banks of Xiannv Town are several feet above the water, so there is no problem. Shaobo was in extreme danger during the flood. The main street also had three or four feet of water. The entire town is only three li long, but the embankments that were washed away, such as Liuzha, Sun Jimaozhou, Nantawangmiao, and Guanyi Qian Shimadou, number more than ten. The town's original rice market and Yangmujiang Lane in the north street were all washed away. About three hundred people were drowned, and about two thousand houses were damaged. Dilapidated houses and crumbling walls are everywhere, a desolate scene that is unbearable to witness. The water has now receded, and the entire town has escaped danger. Local people are working hard to reorganize. The embankments north of the town are also being repaired by the 25th Army, which has sent an engineering team. The disaster situation is even lighter south of Shaobo. The above sections are compared based on observations made along the road from Yangzhou to Xinghua. In short, when the water first flooded, the Gao and Shao areas bore the brunt and suffered the most severely. When the Che Nanxin Sanba opened and the breaches occurred on the east bank of the canal and north of Zhaoguan Dam, the water flowed directly downstream, pouring the water of Hongze, Gaoyou, and Shaobo Lakes, originating from the source, downstream. The low-lying areas of Yancheng, Funing, Xinghua, and Dongtai had no way to discharge and divert the water into the sea, so they had to become a泽国泽国. Therefore, in terms of the current water situation, the disaster in the Lixia River area is actually more severe than in the upper river areas. Relief measures should be taken urgently. According to those with water conservancy experience, in order to relieve the flood disaster in the lower river area, we should take advantage of the current slow water recession and rush to repair the breaches on the east bank of the canal and quickly find ways to excavate the Fan Gong Dike and dredge the Mao You River to lead the water into the sea. The lower river area may be saved. Otherwise, it may become a large lake, and it is impossible to know.</p>
<p>(2) The Current Situation in Xinghua: Xinghua is like the bottom of a pot, where all the waters converge, and it suffers the most severe disaster. Almost no place in the entire county is spared. According to local people, this flood is more than a foot deeper than the last one sixty-six years ago, when the Qing Shui Tan was flooded. Only a corner of the county government in the urban area is dry land. The rest has become a 泽国泽国. The lowest point is about four feet deep, and the highest point is also three feet deep. People travel by wading in the water, which reaches above the chest and abdomen. Their clothes are all wet. Some have specially built small boats about five feet long and three feet wide as transportation tools. Many houses are submerged in water and have collapsed. People mostly live in water pavilions. The water in the four villages is even higher, more than ten feet deep in the deepest places, and more than five or six feet deep in the shallow places. Wherever our (Liu's) relief boat went, within a radius of dozens of li, we did not see a single family cooking. Most of the villagers have no house to live in. Some have built wooden boards and straw mats into houses, some live in large temples and on opera stages, and some have built houses in the trees. Some are even buried in the water all day long. The state of panic is truly the most tragic in the world. When people die, there is no place to put them in the house, and there is no soil to bury them in the fields. Most coffins are hung on trees. The cattle have no grass to eat, and many have starved to death, so cheap that they are six or eight yuan each, and there are no buyers. Villagers mostly kill and eat them. Since Xinghua was surrounded by the flood, the riverbanks in the four villages are indistinguishable. The ferries have long been suspended, and there is no fixed schedule for the help boats. The telegraph poles have been washed down by the water, and the telegrams have not been connected for a long time. Transportation is blocked, and there is no communication. Outsiders are naturally full of doubts, and the truth is unknown. Even the people of Xinghua themselves say that they live in a land of despair, and that the county's rice and grain supply is only enough for ten days. All day long, people are in a panic. Since the arrival of our First Team and the first relief boat of the Relief Affairs Association on August 31, the people of Xinghua have begun to feel a little more at ease. County Magistrate Hua Zhen is ill and does not come out, and he rarely asks about the flood. Although local groups have a temporary organization for disaster relief, because the content is complex, there is little activity. It is hoped that in this time of great disaster, everyone will see righteousness and courage, cooperate to the end, and jointly rescue the crisis. It must be known that the disaster area is so vast and the refugees are so numerous that a few people cannot cope with it.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Inspection Report on the Gaoyou Disaster Area <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Refugees on the West Canal Embankment Crying Bitterly for Their Families</p>
<p>Corpses Piled Up Like Mountains at Beiyaodun</p>
<p>Gaoyou correspondence: On the morning of the 3rd of this month at 7 a.m., I set out from Huayan Temple in the South Gate and headed north along the Canal Embankment to inspect the disaster area. Arriving at the southern end of Shuangrenjintou, I saw that the Canal Embankment there was cracked for more than four zhang. According to residents, the area was extremely dangerous around 12 p.m. on the 26th. When the northwest wind was blowing hard, huge waves directly washed against the embankment, causing it to collapse immediately. Emergency repairs were carried out, but to no effect. Two hours later, because the 25th Lipu south of the city and the Hehuatang, Xiaolubao, and Shaobo areas of Yangzhou also reported breaches, the water level in the Canal dropped by a foot, which saved the embankment. If the embankment had breached there, the whole city of Gaoyou would not have survived. From Shuangrenjintou to the Wangmiao section of the Canal Embankment, the population is dense, and vendors selling food are everywhere. The liveliness is unprecedented. There are more than twenty newly built straw sheds in the Pipa Lock, mostly housing refugees who live outside the North Gate. Their houses have been washed away by the water. There are many clothes piled up outside the sheds, soaked in water. The refugees are all disheveled and dirty, black and thin, and their condition is extremely pitiful. Going north, I arrived at Wangmiao, where there are many refugees. In addition to the house being full, there are many people sleeping in the courtyard. I met Zhao Huchen, the Inspector General of the Sixth District of the Water Police, who said that there were more than 5,000 refugees in the temple. From the 26th to the 28th, the refugees' food was supplied by his private funds. Now, the Gaobao You Patrol Team is receiving and maintaining relief from the Gaoyou Relief Branch. I then said goodbye and went north along the embankment. From the West Gate to Tonghu Bridge, there are more than a thousand straw sheds for refugees, with an estimated seven or eight thousand people. This area is entirely inhabited by residents outside the North Gate, and some refugees are crying in the sheds, because their family members were drowned in the water. The situation is extremely tragic. According to the refugees, the relief associations in the South Gate do not often come to this area to distribute relief, so there are many who are starving. From Tonghu Town to Qigongdian, the Canal Embankment is about a li long. The old and new dikes were destroyed by huge waves on the 25th and 26th. The stonework is completely exposed. The breach at Qigongdian is about twenty zhang long and about two zhang deep. The Qigongdian, which has stood for more than a thousand years, is no longer majestic on the top. There are many small boats parked below the breach. I hired a small boat to inspect back and forth in the southeast. The houses in Zuojiaxiang, Fangsheng Temple, and Tubakouhoujie have all been washed away. A vast expanse of water. About one thousand houses have been washed away in this area. From Tonghu Town, east of Zuojiaxiang, to the North City Gate and Tangzixiang, about two li long, eight out of ten houses have been washed away. Going north to the Royal Wharf, there is a small breach, about five zhang long and about two zhang deep.</p>
<p>The houses below the breach have also been washed away. Further north to Miaoxiangkou (i.e., Hehuatang), the breach there is larger, about sixty zhang long and about two zhang deep. The houses from Kongxinjie to the east of Dangjunlou below the breach have been completely washed away. A vast expanse of water. All that remains are the Yuheng Flour Mill and the Xingshang Gongji, but the houses have suffered heavy losses. When the boat arrived at Hehuatang, the waves were very large. I took the risk and ordered the boatman to cross. Arriving at Dangjunlou, the breach there is the largest of the four, about eighty zhang long and about two zhang deep. After the inspection, I returned to Zuojiaxiang by the same route, preparing to inspect the North Main Street. However, the road was blocked by the fallen houses and I could not go. I landed and walked back to the South Gate, arriving at 1 p.m. After lunch, I hired a boat from the Xiahe Haizi River to inspect north. From the boat, I could see a vast expanse of water in the east, south, and north. The city of Gaoyou is submerged in water, about ten zhang deep. When I arrived at the North and South Yaodun, there were about two thousand refugees gathered in the protective enclosure of the city. The four sides of the mound are surrounded by water. Refugees come and go by small boats. The Red Cross Society of this city has been sending people to salvage corpses in that area for several days, and the corpses are piled up on Beiyaodun, so the corpses are piled up like mountains on Beiyaodun. The situation is extremely tragic. The corpses have rotted and the stench is overflowing. Boats passing through the area cannot help but cover their noses. Crossing the East Gate, there are also a thousand refugees on the city wall, living in straw sheds. Passing through Haichao Temple, I saw that the temple and the houses were completely washed away. The boat can go directly to Taishan Temple. Half of the thirty-six houses in the front courtyard of the temple have collapsed. I entered through the back door. I was invited by the receptionist, Mr. Lian Kaixiang, to the office. According to him, there are a total of 1,860 refugees here. The previous day, some actors who performed at Qigongdian also lived here and set a fire, but fortunately it was extinguished and did not become a major disaster. I immediately sent someone to report to County Magistrate Wang, who then ordered the team to drive the actors out of the area. The order is now calm, but there is too little food. County Magistrate Wang sends eleven bags of foreign flour every day, which is less than four taels per person. Therefore, the refugees cannot eat their fill at every meal. Mr. Lian then led me to inspect the refugees' residences in Wenyoutai and Wanghulou for a week. I then bid farewell and left. I boarded the boat and went west to inspect the areas of Huashijie, Niuji, Yuetang, Chouhebian, Xixiangkou, Yingcheng, Xinqiao, and Zhuntian in the North Gate. The water depth varies from about four to five feet. Most of the families are empty. Some residents are living on the water pavilions. About seven out of ten houses along the way have been washed away by the water. The North Main Street from the North City Gate to the Model Bridge has now been drained of water. I landed and inspected along the way. The North Gate Bridge has been washed away by the water. The east side of the city gate has also been washed away at one corner. The houses on the North Main Street are still neat. Except for those that were washed away at the water's head, the rest are intact. However, Yuxingcheng Shoe Store, Cha Yongcheng Lime Store, and Wanshunchang Store, although they were not harmed by the flood, suddenly suffered a fire on the morning of the 27th of last month. All the houses were burned to the ground, which can be said to be a great misfortune. After the inspection, I returned to the South Gate on the same boat. It was already 7 p.m. (September 4)</p>

<p>Chen Quzhen's Telegram</p>
<p>Rumors that the Guangdong-Guangxi Army is Sending Troops to Western Hunan</p>
<p>Beijing News: It was previously heard here that the Guangdong-Guangxi Army, in order to avoid the real and attack the empty, planned to sneak into western Hunan from the border of Guangxi and extend to the Yangtze River. The communications office of the newly compiled 34th Division stationed in Beijing telegraphed western Hunan to inquire. Now, we have received a reply telegram from Division Commander Chen, saying, "Your telegram is understood. I previously heard that the Guangdong-Guangxi Army was sending troops to western Hunan. I ordered Brother Wu Seng (Director of the Division's Office in the Provincial Capital) to investigate and report the news from the provincial capital. The story that the Guangdong-Guangxi Army is sending troops to western Hunan is unfounded. Moreover, our army's border defenses are solid. Even if evil rebels invade, we swear to meet them head-on with all our strength. If petty thieves cause trouble, we will also find ways to prevent and control them. Within the defense area of western Hunan, where we are responsible, security will be assured. Special reply, Chen Quzhen respectfully (seal). According to this, it can be known that western Hunan is as peaceful as usual. After receiving the telegram, Li Jimin, the director of the division stationed in Beijing, visited Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek to report on the defense situation in western Hunan. He was greatly gratified and promised to provide a large amount of military　equipment　to be transported to western Hunan through that office for replenishment. (September 7)</p>
<h3 id="e76">The Tragedy of the Guangdong Huizhou Ship Sinking <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Capsized in the Shuilong River Due to Overloading</p>
<p>More Than One Hundred People Drowned, Only Dozens Rescued</p>
<p>Guangzhou correspondence: The Huizhou electric ship of the Xin Guangyuan Company, which travels between Guangzhou and Huizhou, has always been required to anchor at the ports along the way during its daily voyage, so that passengers can disembark and embark and load and unload cargo. The ship recently sailed from Huizhou to the province at 8 a.m. on August 30, with about 150 to 160 passengers and a large amount of cargo. After sailing, it normally passed through Boluo County and the Lulan area. It was noon when the ship arrived at Shilong City in Dongguan County. The Shilong Dike has always had a ferry pier for the provincial Huizhou ships. At that time, the Huizhou ferry docked as usual so that passengers could land. There were many passengers in Shilong that day. Before the ship approached the shore, the passengers were preparing to retrieve their luggage and crowded in one corner, causing the ship to lose its balance. When the ship was turning its rudder, the passengers were scrambling to disembark, causing the ship to suddenly tilt to one side. The side with the most weight went into the water first, and all the passengers on the side of the ship fell into the sea. Before long, seawater flowed into the ship, and in a flash, the entire ship sank. When it sank, unfortunately, the small windows next to the ship were completely closed, so none of the passengers in the cabin escaped. Those on the deck jumped into the water to seek help. For a time, the sound of crying shook the sky, and it was unbearable to hear. Neighboring ships, hearing the news, rushed to rescue them, but the river was turbulent, and rescue was difficult. Only thirty or forty people were rescued, and the rest were buried in the bellies of fish. After the ship sank, its bottom faced the sky and was swept by the current to the Longdi area under the railway bridge in Shilong. There were still hundreds of people trapped in the ship who could not escape. The Dongguan County branch office, hearing the news, immediately sent prosecutors to the scene to investigate and sent workers to salvage corpses on the riverbank. Within two days, only more than twenty bodies were salvaged on the surface of the water. In addition, the corpses trapped in the cabin have not yet surfaced. The shipping company has hired four boats and two barges and sailed to the scene of the accident to find ways to lift the sunken ship. The Convenient Hospital of this province has also prepared more than one hundred coffins to go and salvage the corpses. According to those who survived, about one hundred people were drowned in this accident, half of whom were women and children. It is said that the ship has never had so many passengers in the past. Recently, because the Qinsheng steamship, which also travels on the route, was damaged and entered the dock for repairs, only the Huizhou electric ship was traveling back and forth to the province, so the passengers suddenly became crowded, causing this tragic accident.

<p>The Lingtong Section Expected to Open Next Month</p>
<p>Since the resumption of construction on the Lingtong section of the western Longhai Railway this spring, there was an initial plan for completion in October. According to railway news, the section has seen rapid progress with no work stoppage. The roadbed from Lingshi to Tongguan is now fully completed, and tracks have been laid up to a certain point. Currently, passengers and small freight shipments heading west can travel on construction material trains to a certain village. It is expected that the Lingtong section will officially open to traffic on October 1st. After this section is opened, expansion towards Xi'an will continue to facilitate the implementation of the Northwest development plan. The Railway Administration issued the following announcement yesterday: (It has been determined that track laying on the Lingtong section of this railway has reached a certain village. During this construction period, to facilitate merchants and the public, passenger and small freight shipments will be carried on material trains starting August 26th. This has been reported and circulated, so it is hereby announced.)</p>
<p>The Longhai Railway Bureau received an order from the Ministry of Railways to include the railway as a key east-west line in North China in a joint immigration transportation scheme involving the Beining, PingSui, Jinpu, and PingHan railways. Starting September 1st, joint tickets will be issued. The railway has designated five stations: Shangqiu, Kaifeng, Luoyang, Shanzhou, and Zhengzhou, with Zhengzhou as the final destination. Each ticket will be discounted by 40% of the third-class fare, costing one yuan and forty cents from Shangqiu to Zhengzhou, five jiao from Bian (Kaifeng) to Zhengzhou, eight jiao and five fen from Luo (Luoyang) to Zhengzhou, and one yuan eight jiao and five fen from Shan (Shanzhou) to Zhengzhou.

<h3 id="e78">Liu Guitang's Troops Flee to Feicheng <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Ma Hongkui Has Dispatched Troops to Encircle and Suppress</p>
<p>A dispatch from Jinan reports that Liu Guitang's bandit troops suddenly fled north from Liangshan, stopping in the western part of Feicheng. The local militia clashed with them once, suffering significant losses. According to official sources, Liu Guitang's troops were still entrenched in the Yemazhuang area west of Feicheng as of yesterday (the 5th). In addition to pursuing troops following in pursuit, Ma Hongkui, based on repeated urgent telegrams from officials and civilians in Feicheng and a delegation to Tai'an requesting a swift deployment of troops to intercept them and prevent further flight, reportedly dispatched over a thousand men to Feicheng. They are currently deploying defenses and are twenty to thirty li away from Liu Guitang's bandit troops, but there has been no contact yet.</p>
<p>When Liu Guitang's troops passed through the South Gate of Jining, they looted the area, causing enormous losses to the business community of Jining. The Department of Civil Affairs dispatched personnel to Jining today to investigate. The General Headquarters, concerned about the rampant banditry in western Shandong, has specially dispatched Ning Chunxiao, commander of the 64th Brigade, with a regiment of troops from Yanzhou to Jining to provide deterrence. Tang Yaoxun's 65th Brigade has also dispatched a regiment of troops from Jinan to Juancheng on foot, to join forces with Gu Liangyou's command of the Shandong Militia to exterminate the bandits, stabilize western Shandong, and maintain security.</p>
<p>People coming from the city say that Liu Guitang's troops have fled into Feicheng territory, occupying the Xiaogangshan and Anling Station areas, burning, looting, and doing whatever they please. Unable to resist, the villagers have no choice but to flee together, and the sound of weeping along the way is harrowing. Those who are slower to flee have to submit to their abuses. It is also heard that Liu's bandits, unhappy with the villagers' hospitality, set fire to more than twenty village houses. Since before yesterday (the 4th), many of these bandits have also been seen in the Yemazhuang and Tuntou villages. It is heard that Ma Hongkui, General Commander of the 15th Route Army, in response to the people's</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<p>request, has sent a regiment of Ma Quanliang's Brigade stationed at Dawenkou to Feicheng to suppress the bandits. They arrived in Feicheng territory yesterday (the 5th) and are expected to issue orders to encircle and suppress the bandits today (the 6th) or tomorrow (the 7th). After receiving a telegram from Feicheng, Governor Han Fuju also instructed the Third Route Army to deploy a unit to Feicheng to assist in the suppression before he left for Henan, so as to eliminate the bandit scourge as soon as possible. The Feicheng County government, as various units of troops are about to arrive in the county, and to understand the inside story of the bandit situation, also sent personnel to the bandit area yesterday (the 5th) to investigate, in order to exterminate the bandits (6th).</p>

<p>Second Group of Patrol Officers Sent to Province for Training. The Department of Civil Affairs has established a police officer training school and issued an order to the Public Security Bureaus of various counties to select current patrol officers for training in the province. This county previously dispatched three patrol officers, including Luo Zhenglin from the Second District, to study, and they have now graduated and returned to Songjiang, resuming their original positions. Now, having received orders to send a second group to the province for training, Director Shen has designated Zong Yulin from the Eighth Substation, Jiang Shengwu from the Ninth Substation, and Chen Shuliang from the Tenth Substation to carry their credentials and proceed to the province on the 10th. To fill the vacancies, Xu Xuejiang, Meng Zhaoying, and Qian Haiquan, police academy graduates assigned to this county awaiting assignment, will be appointed to act as substitutes.</p>
<p>Danger Arises Again in the Second Section of the Seawall. Sections 3 and 4 of the seawall at Jinshanwei in this county were severely damaged by the violent winds and waves last month, and over a thousand wooden piles were uprooted, leaving the people of coastal counties in imminent danger. The County Chamber of Commerce here urgently telegraphed the provincial government to appeal, and received a reply today (We have instructed the Department of Construction to send personnel to supervise the urgent reinforcement of the seawall. We hereby reply.) Unexpectedly, the First Section of the dike is also in danger due to the wind and rain two days ago (the 6th) and the excessive high tide. Patrolman Li Yihua, seeing the tense situation, urgently sent a letter to District Chief Xu to discuss emergency rescue measures at Jinshanwei. However, Songcheng is lower than sea level, resembling the bottom of a cauldron. Now that the autumn high tide is approaching, it is hard to imagine the disastrous consequences if precautionary measures are not taken. Although the local authorities have sent personnel to investigate, the people are eagerly awaiting the responsible officials to formulate practical and safe measures to protect the lives of several counties.</p>
<p>The Third Security Battalion Captures a Notorious Bandit. Yu Guihe, a notorious bandit operating in eastern Pinghu, is a member of Taibao A Shu's gang. He specializes in committing crimes in the eastern countryside. He was apprehended by Fang, battalion commander of the Third Security Battalion, while loitering in Beicang Town two days ago after his whereabouts were discovered. It is reported that he will be transferred to Songjiang immediately.</p>

<p>Village Head and Grandson Abducted in Xishan. The County Government received a telegram yesterday (the 7th) from District Chief Zhu of Dongting Xishan stating that seven or eight bandits armed with knives and guns suddenly arrived at Hancun Village the night before last at 10 PM. They went to the home of Village Head Jin Zhongsheng, looted items such as rice, and abducted Jin Zhongsheng and his grandson Mei Gang when they left, requesting assistance for rescue. County Magistrate Wu telegraphed the provincial government and ordered the water and land police to tighten the investigation and rescue the hostages. As for Xu A Fa, who was abducted in Baowang Village, he has already been released.</p>
<p>Calamity Never Comes Alone. Zha Genggeng, a native of Changshu, had his brick and tile boat sunk by a coal boat under the Darihui Bridge in Suzhou city on the 1st of this month, drowning Zha Genggeng's wife and daughter. Subsequently, Zha Genggeng's clansman Zha Hehe went to Changshu to inform Zha Genggeng's relatives and then brought seven relatives, including Zha A Er, to Suzhou to handle the aftermath. However, on the way to Suzhou, their boat encountered a bandit ship in Yezhangjing, and all the cash they were carrying was looted, leaving them penniless upon arrival in Suzhou, a truly miserable situation. The shops outside Xumen then pooled together fifty-five yuan to hire workers to salvage the sunken brick and tile boat. Unfortunately, just as they were raising the boat, a stone barge came along, riding the wind and waves, and smashed the brick and tile boat that was about to be salvaged into two pieces. The owner of the stone boat, Guo Qinglang, was immediately taken to the local substation and transferred to the Public Security Bureau for questioning.</p>

Qian Yuming, a 21-year-old from Xiamen, arrived in Suzhou on the 4th and stayed at Room 67 of the New Suzhou Hotel in the city, using the pseudonym Zhou Ziqing. Unexpectedly, on the afternoon of the 6th, he secretly swallowed six bottles of tranquilizer pills. By 8 PM that night, the tea attendant discovered that he had died. The responsible police district reported the incident to the local court, which dispatched personnel yesterday (the 7th) to examine the body. Qian Yuming was wearing a Western suit and appeared to be a student. The reason for his suicide is unknown.</p>

<p>Relief Committee Inquires About the Recent Situation of Dongba. Qian Sunqing of the Wuxi Flood Relief Committee, having heard of the collapse of Dongba in Shenyang County, is concerned that if this is true, Wuxi and other counties are at risk of flooding. He telegraphed the Liyang Chamber of Commerce yesterday.</p>
<p>Autumn Cocoons Soon to Be Weighed and Sold. The early batch of autumn silkworms in Wuxi has already spun their cocoons. The Cocoon Industry Association held a general meeting of members at its clubhouse in Xujialong, in the city yesterday at 3 PM. More than one hundred members, including Yuan Fuchen and Chen Yuanzhu, attended. Hua Shaochun, the chairman, reported on the silk price situation and the autumn silkworm situation this year. The prospects are not very good. Each business opening to buy cocoons must pay a deposit of fifty yuan. The members discussed the price of autumn cocoons and decided on a price of sixty yuan per dan. Weighing and selling will begin once the cocoons are available, and the rest will be handled as in previous years. The meeting adjourned after the discussion. Also, in the fifth district of the county (i.e., Tianshang City), the autumn silkworms in the Yanqiao Village, Qianchang Bridge, Zhangcun, Sitou, and Xizhang Xiaolishi areas are generally safe. However, the cold weather a few days ago caused the discovery of white silkworms, but the losses are not significant. The early batch of "three gourd" variety has already spun its cocoons, and the silkworms are still healthy. Cocoon businesses in Chang'an, Qiaotai, and Pingqiao areas have already started buying cocoons at a high price of sixty yuan, but there are few sellers. The early harvest is less than 10%. The later batch can also spin cocoons in another one or two days. This autumn silkworm crop is almost half a month later than usual. Mulberry leaves have decreased significantly due to being submerged in water, which has had a significant impact.

<p>Garrison Headquarters Orders Investigation of Assassination. Wu Biao, a native of Dongwai, previously served as a detective. He acted as an informant in Shanghai several years ago, leading to the capture of the bandits Zhu A Wu and Xie Peizhi, who were subsequently executed. Wu was dismissed for extorting money in Jiangyin under false pretenses. He took his wife, Wang, and daughter, Junxiu, to Zhabei, Shanghai. On the evening of August 13th this year, he was ambushed and killed by thugs. It is rumored that Zhu's remaining gang members sought revenge for adultery. After the Shanghai Garrison Command detective team leader Deng Jingming and deputy team leader Ma Zhuoqing sent a letter to the Jiangyin Public Security Bureau to investigate the reasons for Wu Biao's dismissal and forward the report to County Magistrate Peng for compliance, it was found in the files that Hua A Peng, a suspect previously released on bail from the Sixth District, has a younger sister, Hua A Rong, who is betrothed to Lu Xiaoyuan. It is suspected that his sister is related to this case. The police were ordered to summon Hua A Peng to the case within two days and hand over his sister for interrogation.

<p>Security Team Captures Two Bandits. Xin and Sheng counties are areas of Zhejiang with many bandits. Gangs rob and loot, abduct people for ransom, and these events are almost daily occurences. Their fierceness and cruelty makes people shudder. Recently, eight people were torn apart in a tea mountain near Dashi, Xin Chang. After the soldiers of the Sixth Regiment, First, Second, and Third Battalions of the Security Team conducted a large-scale joint suppression, they scattered and fled, becoming nothing more than spent arrows. A small group of bandits fled to Yangtianwu in the southern countryside of this county the other day. The troops of Chen Penghua's battalion of the Third Battalion gave chase. As a result, two bandits were captured and sent to the Yuyao Battalion Headquarters on the 5th for transfer to the Baiguan Regiment Headquarters for interrogation.</p>
<p>Bandits Arrested Who Robbed a Yuyao Express Boat. Shi Yongtai, who is currently serving as a boat captain, spotted a bandit who robbed a Yuyao express boat in the Anwan area at the junction of the two counties on the morning of July 22nd. He was wearing a low-brimmed straw hat, walking in the crowd. He and A Da, the owner of the Hexing Fruit Shop, followed him. Later, they saw the bandit buying straw shoes at the Lishunxing Fruit Shop on Xianqian Street, and they reported to the police. The police went forward and arrested him. He was taken to the Public Security Bureau, where Director Zheng Weiyi questioned him. He stubbornly refused to reveal his name, only saying that he was currently a patrol officer in the anti-smuggling team and that he was going to Lianghu to find a job with the security regiment. As he spoke, he pointed to the symbol on his collar and showed a letter of recommendation. However, the symbol was found to be blurred, and his story was determined to be a hoax. He was severely investigated, and his words were vague. A document was prepared to send him to the county for legal action.</p>

<p>Construction Department Urgently Repairs Embankments in Three Counties. The Zhejiang Construction Department received a telegram from the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway Engineering Bureau reporting that the Zhushuihe People's Dike in the Jianzhu Section of the First General Section of the railway had collapsed, and it was feared that it would endanger the railway embankment. It has ordered the general manager of the section and the division chiefs to quickly bring craftsmen and materials to assist the people in urgent protection. After strenuous protection efforts, it is currently safe. However, there are many embankments along the way, and during this season of torrential floods, the rivers are turbulent, making dangers inevitable. Yesterday, the bureau was ordered to dispatch more workers to each section for protection, and the department purchased a large batch of emergency materials for application. Furthermore, the county magistrates of Xiaoshan, Shaoxing, and Zhuji counties were ordered to quickly dispatch competent officials to strictly supervise the nearby residents to protect the construction and to send laborers to patrol in shifts day and night to prevent unforeseen circumstances.</p>

<p>Guangfeng and Guangji Dikes Desperately Awaiting Relief. The Guangfeng Dike in Dongliu County is located on the opposite bank of Anqing, with over ten mu of fields and a population of over ten million. The rural economy has been difficult due to years of disaster and crop failure. Since the beginning of summer this year, there have been continuous heavy rains, and the river tides have been surging. On a recent windy and rainy night, it suddenly collapsed. The surrounding hundreds of miles have become a vast expanse of water, with people and livestock drifting and houses destroyed, a very tragic situation. In addition, the Guangji Dike outside the East Gate of Anqing spans Tongcheng and Huaining counties, with seven to eight million mu of fields and over two million people. It produces several million shi of grain each year and is one of the largest dikes in Anhui. It also collapsed the other day, and many people and livestock were drifting. Now, the general refugees, due to the cool breeze, have no clothing or food, and their situation is precarious. Therefore, the Guangfeng and Guangji dikes deeply hope that all sectors will quickly provide relief to save the survivors.</p>

<h3 id="e90">Afforestation Is the Only Way to Save Us From Floods - Meng Shu <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>This flood in China has spread throughout the country and is unprecedented. The loss of life and property amounts to many trillions, and China, from the government to the common people, is at a loss and can only sigh helplessly. It is pitiful that the general public is disturbed by both internal warfare and the harm of floods. The government is using all its strength to suppress bandits and eliminate communists, which is admirable. I also hope that the government will use all its strength to fight the floods. Who says human power cannot overcome nature?</p>
<p>Everyone knows that it rains too much, but why does a lot of rain in China always cause great harm? Other countries, such as Japan, also have a lot of rain, but why doesn't it cause disasters? Is it that God is kind to others but unkind to us? There must be a reason for it. What is the reason? It is whether or not there is attention to forests.</p>
<p>China not only has no forests, but even if there are any, the trees are cut down before they are fully grown. One aspect is the arbitrary destruction by the people, and the second is that the government does not protect the existing forests. This has been going on for thousands of years, so China has become the world's leading country in lacking forests. The mountains are bare for thousands of miles, not a single tree can be seen. As the years pass, the geology deteriorates, and the general public is still not awakened from their dreams.</p>
<p>Why does a lot of rain in China cause great harm? For example, if a hillside has all the trees cut down, when summer comes and it rains heavily, the rainwater falls from above with a kind of gravity. As the years pass, the surface of the hillside has been hardened by raindrops and cannot store water. Therefore, all the rainwater flows down the hillside, and at the same time, stones, soil, fine sand, etc., are also washed down by the hillside water. Therefore, the speed of the water flow increases, becoming what is called a kind of terrible torrent. Why is it terrible? Because (1) it can not only destroy embankments, but also destroy our cultivated farmland and our houses, (2) it can make the riverbed higher, which is quite dangerous for navigation, (3) it makes fertile arable land in the plains covered with sand and stones, turning it into barren land.</p>
<p>In other words, without forests, the ground cannot store water, and all the rainfall turns into torrents that flow into the rivers. The rivers cannot eliminate the sudden influx of water from various places in a short period of time, and if heavy rain continues to fall, the water level will rise, and floods will occur. Once floods occur, farmland is destroyed, and people have no food, leading to famine. If there is a famine after a flood, this is an unchanging truth throughout the ages. If we understand this, we will know the origin of floods in our country.</p>
<p>Now let's talk about why Japan (and the European and American powers as well) has a lot of rain but doesn't have disasters. This is the result of their attention to forests. Now I will describe the details, taking the above as an example. If we were to afforest this empty hillside, and assuming that this hillside has become a forest, what would happen when it rains heavily in the summer? Of course, the flood damage could be reduced. If the forests across the country are well managed, the flood damage could be completely eliminated. Why?</p>
<p>(1) Because the branches and leaves of broad-leaved forests can absorb one-third of the water, and the branches and leaves of forests with coniferous trees (most common in Japan) can absorb one-half of the water. Afterwards, the rainwater absorbed by these branches and leaves evaporates into the air. As for the excess rainwater that the branches and leaves cannot absorb, it flows into the ground.</p>
<p>(2) Before talking about the water flowing into the ground, we should talk about the geology under the forest. Because we have forests, and the leaves and branches that fall on the ground every winter gradually dry out. The same happens in the third year. Thus, every winter, the fallen leaves accumulate on the ground, so the ground surface has a thick layer of leaves. This layer of leaves has two effects: first, the lower layer of leaves decomposes and mixes with the soil, forming black soil, which can be used as fertilizer and also makes the land fertile, providing nutrition for the trees; second, this layer of leaves has a kind of sponge-like quality for rainwater, able to hold a large amount of water, and absorbing water five, six, or even nine times its own weight. Therefore, a lot of the water flowing into the ground is absorbed by the layer of leaves.</p>
<p>(3) When the layer of leaves reaches saturation, a portion of the water is evaporated by sunlight, and the rest flows into the ground in droplets, becoming spring water.</p>
<p>(4) As for the smallest amount of water that cannot be contained, it flows elsewhere. But in the paths it passes, it encounters endless obstacles: if it doesn't encounter tree trunks and branches, it encounters mosses and other herbaceous plants; if it doesn't encounter tree roots underground, it encounters leaf layers, etc. These obstacles have the function of a funnel. They can make the water flow slowly and can separate the stones and sand from the water. Finally, the smallest amount of water that cannot be contained flows into the river at the slowest speed. Therefore, the riverbed does not rise, and the river water does not rise. Sometimes it rises slightly, but it doesn't do any harm.</p>
<p>In other words, if we pay attention to forests, not only can forests be used to remove most of the rainwater, but they can also turn a large amount of rainwater into slow-moving water. Even if heavy rain continues to fall, the river water can flow away calmly. Farmland can be irrigated, and people have enough food and clothing. Therefore, the wealth and civilization of a country, and the attention to forests, is a most important element.</p>
<p>Another thing that can cause floods is snowmelt. Snow accumulates in the mountains and does not melt in winter. If there are no forests, hot rain or sunlight in the spring and summer will completely touch the snow, so it melts faster, and there is a risk of flooding. If there are forests, their branches, etc., can block the complete contact with rain or sunlight. The snow melts slower, and floods are less likely to occur.</p>
<p>From the above, the relationship between forests and floods is very important. European and American countries have always had relatively developed forests. The governments are also continuously promoting afforestation. One reason is that European and American industries are developed and require too much timber. The second is that sometimes there are still small floods, so they constantly encourage afforestation. The attention that European and American countries pay to the lives of their people can be seen from this. However, afforestation is not something that can be achieved overnight. The ancients said, "The plan for ten years lies in planting trees." I alone think that this is not enough. If the government wants to engage in afforestation, now is the time. Otherwise, such floods will continue to emerge, and the national pulse is in danger. (Sent from Nancy, France)</p>

<p>The Municipal Education Bureau Requests Contributions from Various Concessions</p>
<p>Twelve Percent for Education Funding is Underway</p>
<p>(China Eastern News Agency) Regarding the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau's recovery of education rights in concessions, yesterday, according to Lu Buqing, section chief of the Second Section of the Municipal Education Bureau, speaking to a reporter from the China Eastern News Agency, it is not appropriate to say that the education rights within the concessions of this port have not been lost and recovered. However, the internal facilities of schools founded by the Public Works Department, such as the Chinese Children's Technical and Vocational Schools, the East District, West District, North District, and Girls' Middle Schools, do not comply with the regulations of the Ministry of Education. For the sake of unifying education rights, this bureau is urging them to register and file as soon as possible. It is expected that this matter will have excellent results, because if the above-mentioned schools do not register and file, there will be major obstacles for the graduates' future. As for the request to the Public Works Department to allocate 2/10 of the annual revenue of 20 million in various taxes and levies to education funding, this is also currently underway.</p>

<p>The day before yesterday (the 6th), at 2:00 PM, the General Association of Chinese Students Who Studied in Belgium held its first anniversary meeting at the Yipinxian Grand Auditorium on Xizang Road. Approximately forty members attended. Li Yingbiao, representing Belgium, presided, and Yang Qi served as the recorder. First, the chairman reported on the work of the past year, followed by a discussion on amending the constitution and re-electing officers. Li Yingbiao, Yang Qi, Jiang Wenxin, He Shangping, Chen Qifu, and five others were elected as executive committee members. Liao Songxue, Yang Sifu, and Liu Zhimou were elected as supervisory committee members. The meeting adjourned at 5:30 PM, followed by a dinner. In addition to all members and their families, invited guests included Fan Zhengbo, Nong Ruhui, and foreign guests such as the Belgian Vice-Consul He Mengshi. At the dinner, Wang Jingqi first gave a speech, saying that what he hopes from the Belgian alumni is not only that they will make full use of the skills and knowledge they acquired during their studies to contribute to China, but also, and most importantly, that they will not forget the Belgian national spirit and perseverance—the ability to be peaceful and to strive—and take it as our model. If two or three Chinese people insist that small and weak countries cannot have fair diplomacy, cannot have prosperous industries, and cannot have the ability to resist powerful neighbors, the alumni will certainly not believe them, because the example of Belgium is there to prove that things are accomplished by human effort. Then, the Belgian Vice-Consul, He Shangping, Li Yingbiao, and others delivered speeches one after another, and lottery tickets were prepared to help with the fun. The first prize was a gramophone, won by Wang Jingqi, who then donated it back to the association. The gathering ended happily at 10:00 PM.</p>

<h3 id="e101">Last Night's Basketball Game: Qingguang Wins Big Over Military Academy <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Result: 29 to 17</p>
<p>Tomorrow Night's Confrontation with Jinan</p>
<p>The Nanjing Central Military Academy basketball team made its debut the night before last, defeating the Artillery Team by two points. Last night, at 7:30 PM, they competed with Qingguang, and as a result, lost 17 to 29. Tomorrow night at 7:30 PM, they will confront Jinan.</p>
<p>▲ The Military Academy is a Flash in the Pan: The military academy players are tall and strong. At the start of the game, they made a surprising move. Li Gongyu and Huang Guangqian successively scored points, earning as many as four points and creating a powerful momentum, making people shudder. However, the Qingguang veterans have been through many battles, and victory or defeat is not enough to move their hearts. Once the enemy's situation is detected, defeating the enemy is as easy as turning one's hand. Starting with Tan Dahua's three-pointer, Xu Kepei and others continued to advance fiercely, completing fourteen points in one breath. Although the military academy was brave, there was no room for counterattack. In the first half, Qingguang had fourteen points, and the military academy had four points.</p>
<p>▲ Qingguang Showed Mercy: Starting in the second half, Zhang Jinxiang scored in the basket, and Xu Kepei followed suit. With Qingguang's victory already determined, they took turns sending generals to respond. At this time, the military academy took the opportunity to attack and made some improvements. The short general Yin Hanchu's movements were interesting and his skills were also quite impressive. As a result of the game, Qingguang won by a large margin of twenty-nine to seventeen over the military academy. The referee was Shao Ji.</p>

<h3 id="e103">Race Meeting Preparatory Performance <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday (6th) at 4 pm, the Chinese Race Walking Association specially selected new talents at the China Athletics Field to prepare to join the City Games performance race walking. Unexpectedly, it rained heavily all day, and the postponement was imminent. Fortunately, after 3 o'clock, the sky suddenly cleared, and the contestants began to report one after another. When the clock struck four times, Mr. Lu Yutian grouped and called the roll, and then Mr. Zhang Zaocai gave the order. Messrs. Shi Youhui, Shi Jinsheng, and Yao Wenhui timed the race, and Zhou Yuyu, Le Meigang, Zhang Zao, Jiu Hoge, Ren Cai Shuyan, and Lu Yutian supervised. In addition, the Boy Scouts of the 270th Regiment were on the scene to provide first aid and maintain order. Therefore, as a result, many people completed the 5,000-meter run with excellent results within 27 or 28 minutes. It can be seen that in the future, maintaining the International Race Walking Championship can be predicted. The list of players joining the City Games performance competition will be submitted to the Municipal Education Bureau in the coming days. Furthermore, in view of the fact that those who are old, such as Ge Zhonggao, and those who are young, such as Wang Mengmao, have achieved considerable results, they are also included for promotion and encouragement.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Liu Jian Discusses with Lin Baohua the Deliberation of the Top Ten Chinese Tennis Rankings <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Lin Baohua, a Chinese tennis master who has been away for a long time and returned to Shanghai, published an article on the "Top Ten Chinese Tennis Players" in the Times on September 4. The order listed is quite flawed. Although his words are not official, the impact on the facts is very significant. Because this kind of statement lacks a factual proof, and the ten outstanding figures he mentioned are all written from love and hatred, in order to give the people of the country a real understanding, I do not hesitate to venture to state as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The Narrowness of the Location: The ten outstanding figures discussed by Mr. Lin are limited to Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Singapore. How can the two words "nationwide" be included? Moreover, South China has always produced talents, and there are many well-known figures in the tennis world today. How can they be allowed to be neglected?</p>
<p>(2) Lack of Facts: Mr. Lin indirectly occupies the first seat, degrading others, which gives people a kind of aversion. Moreover, it is difficult to determine the good guys sitting in the top three chairs without going through a kind of real competition. If you rely solely on the victory over Qiu in the past to put yourself in the first seat, place Qiu Feihai in the middle, and demote Lin Wangsu to the back, the injustice is obvious. Recalling the battle between the two Lins (Lin Baohua and Lin Wangsu played against each other before Lin Baohua fought against Qiu Feihai. Lin Wangsu won two sets in a row and took the lead. It was not finished due to darkness. Later, Lin Baohua did not finish the game for other reasons.) Lin Wangsu had a great chance of defeating Lin Baohua. If Qiu and Lin (Wangsu) are compared, then Lin is far inferior to Qiu (In various competitions in Singapore over the years, Lin Wangsu only won against Qiu Feihai once, and lost repeatedly in the rest of the battles.) Therefore, the order of the top three is currently a major suspense. As for the rest, such as:</p>
<p>Gao Huimin: Although Gao is the master of Beijing, his skills are mediocre and he has no special strengths. When Gao once represented North China in the national zonal competition, he made a debut in Shanghai, but was defeated by the generals of East China. It seems that there is no basis for Lin to place him in the fourth seat. And there are many people in the country who are better than Gao's skills, such as Luo Wenhui and Wu Renguang in Hong Kong, Gao Chixun in Guangzhou, and Cai Chunliang (transliteration) and Lin Yuehan in Singapore.</p>
<p>Gao is really no match.</p>
<p>Zheng Zhaojia: Zheng is a promising new player, young and handsome, with unlimited prospects. Unfortunately, he suffered from stomach problems this year and rarely practiced. However, judging from his level and hitting method, he is still in his infancy. It is not yet time to include him in the list of ten outstanding figures. According to the national games last year, Zheng represented Shanghai in Hangzhou and was defeated by the Zhejiang player Chen Naixin in the preliminary round. Checking his past achievements, in addition to winning the student singles championship in Tianjin and winning the Chinese Open doubles championship with Lin Baohua last year, he has no other significant achievements. Lin said that he had defeated Jiang Daozhang, which is a mistake and should be corrected.</p>
<p>Jiang Daozhang: Mr. Jiang has a large physique, so he feels a little slow when moving. Although his skills have not reached the point of perfection, he is now making progress day by day. How can it be said that his golden age is over? This can be proved by Jiang's battles against Can's Leed and Day's Machida in the Rotary Cup. How can Lin, who relegated him under Gao and Zheng, not complain?</p>
<p>The rest, such as Wu Shaoxiang and Liang Baokui, are all rising stars, but there are people everywhere in the country whose skills are equal to theirs. If they are included in the first-class masters, it is a theory of likes and dislikes. Although I am in my thirties, I have always loved tennis. Although my skills are not good, I have accumulated more than ten years of experience and have deep friendships with masters from all over the world. I think I have a silly idea, so I dare to discuss the order of the ten outstanding figures discussed by Mr. Lin in order to match the facts, and not to slander Mr. Lin. Here is the list of the ten outstanding figures I have cited. I don't know whether the tennis community agrees with it or not. I still ask for advice.</p>
<p>(1) Lin Baohua (order undecided)</p>
<p>(2) Qiu Feihai (order undecided)</p>
<p>(3) Lin Wangsu (order undecided)</p>
<p>(4) Cai Chunliang (Chua Choon Leong): Note that when Qiu Feihai won the Malayan Islands Championship in Singapore for three consecutive years, Cai was repeatedly the runner-up, and in 1925 he defeated the first master of the Philippines, Aligan, in the Philippines.</p>
<p>(5) Luo Wenhui: Hong Kong Open Singles Champion last year</p>
<p>(6) Jiang Daozhang</p>
<p>(7) Wu Shigang</p>
<p>(8) Lin Yuehan</p>
<p>(9) Ma Chixun: Singles and Doubles Champion of the National Games in Hangzhou in the 19th year</p>
<p>(10) Gao Huimin or He Jialiu</p>

<p>Nanyang Won 3-0 Yesterday</p>
<p>Situ Wei and Wang Chunruo are the Top Players of Haixing</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, the Haixing Women's Volleyball Team played a practice match with Nanyang High School of Commerce at the Nanyang Court on Tongji Road. Although Haixing lost 0-3, the scores were very close, and the intensity can be known. The scores were 21-16, 22-20, and 21-11. Nanyang is a mixed team of teachers and students. Under the fierce pressure and killing of Haixing, they were unyielding, especially the talents of Situ Wei and Wang Chunruo, the players of the Dadao, were the most skillful, and the passes, spikes, and saves were meticulous. Tao Li was not bad either. In the City Games in the future, there will be a fierce battle with Wuben. Haixing is scheduled to play Nanyang Model Middle School at the Jiaotong University court tomorrow. The single lineup was as follows yesterday:</p>
<p>First Row Second Row Third Row</p>

<p>Notice from the Organizing Committee: The Jiande team recognized that Article 3 of the resolution of the Third Congress of Representatives of each team in this session canceled the qualification of its team member Lu Zhongqiu to participate in the Champagne Cup, believing that "the team member organization has been broken and ruptured, and we have to withdraw for the whole year." A special letter was sent to the meeting to state this. The organizing committee is very sorry for the team's misunderstanding of subjective events. However, since it has no intention of participating, it is allowed to withdraw. Therefore, all matches scheduled with the team on the order form will be canceled. All the registration fee of two yuan will be transferred to the Shanghai Fundraising Association for the Relief of Flood Disasters in Various Provinces.</p>

<h3 id="e112">Zhu Qinglan Narrates the Tragic Situation of Floods in Various Provinces <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, the Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters held the weekly memorial service for Dr. Sun Yat-sen and invited Mr. Zhu Qinglan to speak about the tragic situation of floods in various provinces in the Southeast to expand publicity. The meeting was presided over by Mr. Pan Gongzhan, a standing committee member of the City Party Headquarters. After the ritual, a brief report on last week's work was given, followed by an introduction of Mr. Zhu Qinglan to deliver his speech. The following is the speech by Mr. Zhu: (Ladies and Gentlemen, I am both happy and worried to meet you all today. I am happy that I have the opportunity to speak today, but I am worried about the floods in various provinces and cities across the country, where the disaster situation is very serious. I am happy that Shanghai is spared and has a piece of clean land, but I am worried about whether the people across the country will pay attention to this flood and give the best possible help. This spring, I personally went to Shaanxi to inspect the severe disaster situation there. The severity and complexity of the disaster was rarely seen in history. In March, I came to Shanghai to invite leaders from all walks of life in Shanghai to discuss fundraising. I am grateful to the groups and philanthropists in this city for their enthusiastic donations, raising 400,000 gold coins to take to Shaanxi for disaster relief. I dare not boast about the results, but the desolate and barren land of the past is now filled with the sounds of chickens and dogs, and men and women are farming in the fields. Although the local vitality has not been fully restored, the people's livelihood has begun to show a glimmer of hope. This is something to be gratified by the people of this city. On behalf of the hundreds of thousands of disaster victims in Shaanxi, I bow deeply in gratitude. This year, the disaster situation in Gansu is also very serious, coupled with war and traffic obstruction. I went to inspect despite the difficulties. The local product is hardship, the bandits are fierce, the disaster situation is serious, and the suffering of the people is beyond description. In addition, volcanoes erupt frequently, and villages and towns are often in ruins, which is heartbreaking and unbearable to witness. The difference between Gansu's disaster relief and other provinces is that the political problem must be solved first. Otherwise, relief workers will not be able to carry out relief, and the disaster victims will never be relieved of their suffering due to the continuous disaster. On the way back south, I received an urgent telegram from the central government, saying that the Southeast was suffering from floods, and I rushed south to help with the relief. A few days later, I received an urgent telegram from Peiping (Beijing), saying that the disaster areas in the war zone were in urgent need of fundraising, and asked me to come to Peiping immediately to preside over everything. I took a detour to the war-torn disaster area in Baoding to make preliminary arrangements before taking a train south. The water on both sides was flooded, and the fields were submerged. The disaster situation along the Jinpu Railway was particularly tragic. The water was chest-deep, and there were no local good people to provide relief. The cries for help were unanswered. The old and weak died in ditches, and the young and strong struggled to survive. Corpses floated on the water, and the living were pale and emaciated. I asked the police at the train station and was told that some people had to fill their stomachs with one cake for four or five days. Helpless, I gave them some money and asked them to buy food to eat and wait for rescue. When I arrived in Shanghai, urgent telegrams were piled up, and representatives seeking relief followed one after another. Considering that relief could not be delayed and the true situation of the disaster needed to be known, I took a plane to Hankou to inspect. The areas around Wuhu, Anqing, and Jiujiang were a vast expanse of water, with fields submerged and houses floating. The once prosperous villages and towns had been transformed into swamps. Only the roofs and treetops were visible on the water. Corpses were floating and the stench filled the air. The surface of the Yangtze River in Hankou was both water and fire, making the situation even more tragic. The stench in the streets of Hankou made people imagine the terrible epidemic that would follow the flood. Fortunately, Wuhan relied on its former prosperity, and the disaster victims were not starving to death. Compared with other places, it was already considered lucky. After returning to Shanghai, I immediately sent a large number of staff to provide urgent relief. However, there were many obstacles during the implementation, which was difficult to achieve. Soon, I received a warning from Jiangbei, so I rushed to the Gaoyou and Shaobo areas. The people, animals, and houses had been submerged. Some of the disaster victims took boats to other places, but I don’t know how many died. Those who relied on their hometown and were eventually chased by the water waves did not know how many. Sighing and looking up at the embankment, even those on the rooftops were not safe. In short, the Southeast, which is known for its prosperity in the country, has suffered this catastrophe. Heaven's cruelty to us can be said to be both tragic and cruel. To attribute the crime and reveal the bottom line, the people cannot escape the blame. For the current plan, there are three things that need to be done urgently: first, urgent relief; second, industrial relief; and third, agricultural relief. Step by step, do it seriously, or there may be a day when the people will be relieved. Now is the time to raise funds, which is easier to arrange. In the future, when urgent relief is implemented, the funds will be ten or a hundred times more than today, and the difficulty of donating funds will also be ten or a hundred times more than today. Then, the hidden worries of the society and the future of the nation can be imagined. At this time, the country is in trouble, and the national steps are difficult. All of us Chinese people must not wake up and work hard to revitalize. It is painful for those who are close to us and pleasing to those who hate us. Imperialists are taking advantage of the situation and invading step by step. How can we resist them? How can we maintain the survival of the country and the livelihood of the people? Those who have money contribute money, and those who have no money contribute effort. Exhaust the power of the people across the country to deal with it. Although the disaster situation is great, relief has been achieved. People will conquer nature. I am willing to work hard with you all and my compatriots across the country.)

<p>(1) The shallow water areas of the West Bank should be blocked and built solid immediately, with crushed stone slopes added, and progress should be made step by step to achieve contraction. (2) The breaches in the East Bank should be wrapped with head protection to prevent further collapse. (3) Organize the East Bank defense works. (4) Wrap the foot of the East Bank slope and make windbreaks as appropriate. (5) The East Bank breach has been leveled and the top has been cleaned up and the roads cleared to facilitate the transportation and storage of materials and to benefit the work. However, it is still not easy to plug the breach now, because there is nowhere to store materials and there is water everywhere. Now, I will divide the breaches I saw below (those within ten feet that are easy to block are excluded). (1) Two breaches of forty feet at Majia directly damaged six gates. (2) Heiyu Pond sixty feet, a total of four breaches. (3) Zhaoguan Dam more than fifty feet, the water flow is very rapid, I heard that the dam foundation has been washed away, and the waves are two miles long, pouring straight down. (4) Lotus Pond more than ninety feet, the flow is also rapid. (5) Laisheng Nunnery thirty feet, the land belongs to Lujin Weinei, 36,000 mu, the residents on the ground have been washed away. (6) Thirty Li Pu more than sixty feet, the bank behind the gate has been destroyed, and the dam will collapse one after another. There are three breaches in the West Bank, one of which is very serious. (7) Twenty Li Pu ninety feet, the water situation is dangerous. (8) Qigong Temple thirty feet, not very smooth in the past. (9) Yuma Tou forty feet, the water situation is very dangerous. (10) Miaoxiang Kou seventy feet, the water situation is extremely dangerous. Yaogunjian Building is about 170 feet long, the situation is the most dangerous, the sound of the water is turbulent, and the sound is heard for ten miles. Dozens of ships were washed down the breach and died together. Alas! In short, if the breach is not blocked for a day, the water of Hongze Lake will inevitably pour into the various counties of Yang, and the villages, towns, and cities will be turned into lakes. The saying that the West Lake moved east has unfortunately come true. It is a catastrophe that has never happened before. Chairman Ye asked Uncle Xiang to participate in the matter in person, and Uncle Gong still said that he was not sure, but after repeated appointments, he promised to transfer the appointment to Wan Xiaoan, who is also a water conservancy expert in Suzhou. Chairman Ye decided to go to Qingjiang with Uncle Gong to visit Xiao Lao in person. Jing then divided the boat with him. Director Li has been busy on the canal for several days, has already understood the situation, is brave in taking responsibility, and is doing his best to plan, which is admirable. In short, the two public officials, Ye and Li, have a compassionate heart, and those who do not take responsibility cannot be compared on the same day. That night, Jin Junxingya and Shi Junzhiying had rescued 200 refugees and transported them to Yangzhou for resettlement. On the second day of September, when the resettlement was located in the three places of Dawang Temple Chengtian Temple, etc., more than 6,000 people were rescued. Temporary resettlement was established in more than forty places, and ships were used for transportation and have been revoked. The most lacking in You and Shao are rice, food, and reeds, and telegrams have been sent to Shanghai and Yang for handling. In the morning, passing Jieshou, there was backwater five miles away, which was not very fierce. There was backwater fifteen miles away from Shuishui, which was also very peaceful. In the afternoon, a storm came from the southeast, and the backwater rose by several feet along the way. In the afternoon, I arrived at Bao Ying and met the local elders. The backwater rose sharply last night and this morning, breaking the Taiping and other embankments. The water had forced the northeast gate. A meeting was held at the Jinsheng Association, and Mr. Bao Zhizhi and others cried bitterly. In the evening, I went out of the east gate to look at the water, and only the Tongxing Embankment was not broken. Thousands of people were rushing to protect it, and the sound of evil was miserable. At night, gongs were sounded everywhere, and people were talking, because once the Tongxing Embankment was broken, there would be no clean land in the whole area. According to reports, many people died in Dongxiang. The office in Bao was hired by the association to hire sixty ships to rescue the lives. Once rescued, they should be kept together with the more than 1,000 Gaoyou refugees who have been resettled. The people in the city are in a panic, and there is a tendency to be unsustainable. On the second day, the ships still did not reply, and more than twenty were requisitioned. In the afternoon, I went south to Shuishui and asked Mr. Hua Fu to organize a resettlement center and requisition ships. In the evening, I passed Jieshou and contacted the local area and requisitioned fifty ships to rescue and resettle. On the morning of the third day, Kui Gaoyou, Director Zhu Zhongjian had arrived in Yangzhou to contact the resettlement. I did not meet him. On this day, You successively resettled more than 6,000 people. At noon, I arrived in Yangzhou. The two gentlemen Cao and Yuan had added two resettlement centers because the three places were not enough for resettlement and had requisitioned eighty ships to go to remote areas to rescue disaster victims. The kitchen utensils were complete and the office was very well-organized. At that time, I immediately decided on various measures with Cao, Yuan, and Zhu. On the morning of the fourth day, I arrived in Zhenjiang and discussed the issues of Zhenkuan Zhenpin and restoring traffic with Leng Yuqiu, Lu Xiaobo, and Director Hu. That evening, I took a night train to Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Disaster Victims from Gaoyou and Shaobo Arrive in Shanghai <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, 4,000 refugees from Gaoyou and Shaobo in northern Jiangsu arrived in Shanghai and were resettled by the Shanghai Disaster Victim Resettlement Office at Chao Hui Villa. Fourteen people had gone to the Chaozhou Wuyi Villa at the South Railway Station and were also provided with accommodation and supplies by the Resettlement Office. Yesterday, reporters from the Guowen News Agency went to various places to investigate and found that the resettlement in various places had increased compared with a few days ago. The disaster victims were from the four provinces of Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu. Other provinces have not been seen. The statistics of the number of people resettled in recent days are as follows: 16 people at the Liuying Road Resettlement Center in Zhabei, 130 people at Qu Zhenren Temple on Zhizaoju Road, 125 people at the Hunan Guild Hall on Xieqiao, 95 people at the Dongting Dongshan Guild Hall on Liyuan Road, 40 people at the Suzhou Jiyi Public Office, 24 people at the Chaozhou Wuyi Villa at the South Railway Station, 204 people at the Chao Hui Villa on Longhua Road, 63 people at the Gaochang Temple on Dananmen, 21 people at the Cuiwei Nunnery on Liuying Road in Zhabei, 40 people at the Zhejiang Jinji Shantang on Liyuan Road, and more than 40 people at the Chao Hui Villa on Longhua Road.</p>

<h3 id="e116">Investigation Report on the Disaster Situation in Jiangpu <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Flood Relief Association requested Mr. Wang Shaoyun to go to investigate the disaster situation in Jiangpu. The investigation report is excerpted below. (1) Causes of the disaster: This summer, the county has been experiencing continuous rain for ten days, and the rivers have been rising. The weirs and banks in the countryside are low and already in danger. In addition, floods broke out in Huangshan, Anhui Province, rushing to Pujing via Quanjiao, and pouring down. The water was huge, reaching several feet high. The big and small weirs and banks were all breached, and the roofs of the houses and the tops of the trees were submerged under the water. It was extremely tragic for a while. (2) Disaster-stricken areas: The county is divided into five major areas. The disaster situation is the most serious in the eastern area, followed by the northern area, then the southern and central areas, and the western area is free from disaster, only suffering slight losses during strong winds. A. Eastern area: It belongs to the Banqiao Huaqi Camp area. Among the villages in this area, Beicheng suffered the most, followed by Gao Li Yi and Er villages, and then Hua Ta Ding Nao and other villages. Beicheng is close to Anhui Province, and the mountain flood broke out, bearing the brunt. Beicheng Weir is the largest weir in the county, with a circumference of more than forty miles and about 30,000 to 40,000 mu of farmland. The weir bank was breached in eighteen places, ranging from forty to fifty feet long to more than ten feet short. In addition, the Sanlian Yueyang two weirs nearby were breached at the same time, with about 20,000 mu of farmland each, and suddenly became a swamp. Other places such as Jiqing Township, Laoyougang, and General Temple were also submerged, and they were waiting for relief. According to the Red Swastika Society's investigation report, there were more than 1,800 households. B. Northern area: It belongs to the Dongge area. This area has a larger area and the largest population. Nineteen villages were affected by the disaster, and twenty-five weirs were breached, with Kangjia Weir being the most serious, followed by Xujia Weir and Fuxing Weir. When the flood came, a large gap was washed away in the nearby mountains, about several feet wide, and there were many small gaps. The ferocity of the water can be imagined. A total of about 40,000 mu of farmland was submerged, and more than 4,000 households were affected by the disaster. C. Southern area: It belongs to the Puzhen area. Gao Wang, Changshan Bridge, Dongzun West and other places are all disasters, with more than ten weirs breached and more than 800 households affected by the disaster. They moved to Gaofu and were waiting to be fed. Since August 25 and 26, the wind was strong and the tide was high, and more were submerged. Fifteen of the sixteen villages in the area were affected by the disaster. D. Central area: The disaster situation in Jiufu Township in this area is more serious, followed by Shifo and then Luofeng. Initially, fewer than ten weirs were breached, but since the wind disaster, it has become even more widespread. The situation is similar to that in the southern area. E. Western area: This area is a mountainous area and is free from disaster, but after strong winds, Huangcaofang, Xiaoli Township, and Zhaojiaba suffered slight losses. (3) Emergency relief situation: Since the county was affected by the disaster, the Red Swastika Society organized 200 bags of flour for emergency distribution and sent a wheel to rescue more than 1,000 people. The second time, another 2,000 bags of flour and 2,000 reed mats were distributed, but only for the use of the northeastern area. In addition, various businesses in Puzhen raised more than 1,000 yuan to relieve the eastern area. The provincial government issued 5,000 yuan, which is still in the county government. It is now planned to purchase flour and distribute it in different areas. This is the general situation of emergency relief. (4) Needs for continued relief: This time, the county was flooded in various areas. At the beginning, the disaster victims could move to higher places and bring some food and utensils. When the mountain flood broke out, the high and low weirs and fields were submerged. Many disaster victims climbed trees, and those who could not escape were drifting with the current. In the eastern area alone, about two or three hundred people were drowned. The fields, houses, food, livestock, farm tools, and food were washed away. The survivors after the robbery had no home to return to and were sleeping in the open air, waiting to die. The cries for help were unbearable to hear. The water is still more than ten feet high, and it is a vast expanse of water. Looking into the distance, only the treetops can be seen. It is a catastrophe that has not happened in a hundred years. In the blink of an eye, autumn will pass and winter will come, and the water will recede. The future is long. Alas, these disaster victims have no place to live, no clothes to keep warm, and no food to eat. How can they bear it? Therefore, emergency relief is necessary today, and winter relief should not be delayed. How should we continue to raise relief funds? Please decide and implement it.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Report from Dongtai: The Water Level Continues to Rise <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Dongtai Shanghai Association received a letter from the county's temporary flood relief association, stating that the water level has increased without decreasing in recent days. The city is several feet deep in water, and boats are passing through the streets. The houses have been washed away, and people and animals have been drifting away. The warehouses have been destroyed, and the losses are incalculable. The disaster victims are clinging to trees, waiting to be rescued. The leaves of the trees have been eaten, followed by algae. The wailing is deafening, and it is unbearable to hear. The corpses are rolling and drifting downstream. The most tragic thing is that the corpses of men, women, and children are tied together with ropes, thinking that the whole family could not escape and made the decision to live together and die together. The county previously sent Liu Shaoxuan to Dafeng Yuhua to open the Beimaoyou River Dam, but the two companies still firmly resisted. However, the provincial government has telegraphed Supervisor Zhang and Director Li to allocate teams to assist, and representatives from the three counties of Taiyan have also arrived in Dongtai one after another to discuss the way out of the West Water. On the 30th, the Xiaohai people went to Wenwangjiagang to dredge the sand and at the same time demanded the opening of the Wangjiagang Fuli River in the nine counties of Xiahe, which was blocked by the gate dam of the Zhongtong Sui Company, in order to facilitate the common discharge. However, the Tong Sui Dafeng Company and other hundreds of tenant farmers colluded, holding iron forks, wooden sticks, broadswords, etc., and swarmed to intercept and attack. Now, many corpses have been found at the mouth of Wangjiagang, and the families have identified Shan Baolai and Wang Wenshou. Others are still under investigation. On the 31st, provincial government member Wu Yuanyou brought 6,000 yuan in foreign currency and 100 bags of flour to Dongtai for emergency relief. The county flood relief association discussed and decided on the following distribution methods: (1) Dry food will be distributed immediately. (2) Flour will be made into cakes, steamed buns, and other foods immediately. (3) 6,000 yuan in relief funds will be used as immigration fees for 50% and relief fees for 50%. (4) Ferries and civilian ships will be dispatched as much as possible. (5) Immigration fees will be issued after the disaster victims reach the concentration point (those leaving the county). (6) Ships will be sent out to purchase and immigrate for food. (7) Implement Ping Ti. (8) Send another telegram to the province for relief. (9) Immigrate to Jiangdu Nantong and other counties. (10) Committee member Wu and County Magistrate Huang telegraphed the three counties of Nantong Jiangdu Rugao to set up refugee shelters. (11) Relief funds and supplies will be received and distributed by this association. The Nantong County Flood Relief Group has prepared relief food, four steamers, and twenty-five civilian ships, which will be sent to Dongxing and will arrive on the 1st. On the same day, Rugao County also sent a steamer. A rescue team has been organized and divided into five groups to rescue the lives. The disaster situation is so serious that it is rare in ancient times. It is useless without a large amount of emergency relief. It is also hoped that the Sanhe Dam in Huxi will be reinforced to prevent the source. Otherwise, the eastward migration of Hongze Lake will become a reality, and the disaster will be even more unpredictable.</p>

<h3 id="e120">The Relief Committee Announces Ten Admonitions for Relief Distribution <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Xu Shiying, concerned that relief personnel in various provinces currently engaged in urgent relief efforts might be negligent or engage in embezzlement, personally drafted ten admonitions for relief distribution. These were promulgated by the Central Relief Committee and are recorded below: (1) Know that relief distribution is the most important duty and greatest responsibility of mankind. One should dedicate one's entire body and mind to the victims, embracing a spirit of self-sacrifice and putting forth genuine effort to fulfill this serious mission. (2) Know that the lives of the victims rest on your shoulders and their survival is in your hands. (3) Know that relief funds are of utmost importance. Embezzlement and corruption are unforgivable sins and misappropriation violates national laws. (4) Know that saving the afflicted is like fighting a fire. There should be no delay or carelessness. (5) Be diligent in your own life. Be upright and conscientious. Be meticulous in your planning and efficient in your execution. (6) Always maintain a strong spirit and be thorough in your actions. Furthermore, remain calm and patient and do not be afraid of hard work. (7) Do not rely on hearsay and never delegate to others. Investigations must be thorough and precise and distributions must be meticulous and thoughtful. Every penny and every ticket must be personally delivered to the victims. (8) Immerse yourself among the victims. You must put yourself in their shoes and think from their perspective. Treat the diseases and suffering of the victims as you would the diseases and suffering of your own parents, siblings, and children. Do your best to provide assistance and do not simply consider the distribution of money and food as the end of the matter. (9) After each day's work, examine your conscience and carefully reflect on your actions. Examine yourself for any mistakes and use your personal experiences to improve relief efforts. (10) Know that one penny can save a life. Wasting one penny is tantamount to killing a life. Failure to be honest and thorough is self-destructive and goes against conscience. Sucking the marrow of the victims is like condemning your descendants to eternal suffering. The innocent children are watched over by Heaven above. Rewards and punishments will be given without fail. A single moment of carelessness will be condemned by both man and Heaven. Be vigilant and careful.</p>
<h3 id="e121">The Sino-Foreign Relief Association Accelerates Disaster Relief <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>▲The Sino-Foreign Relief Association's Investigator Returns from Jiangbei. Gu Jisheng, vice-chairman of the Sino-Foreign Relief Association, along with members Lu Bohong, Wang Junsheng, and others, went to Yangzhou to inspect the disaster areas of Jiangbei and organize the Yangzhou branch. They returned to Shanghai yesterday. The disaster situation in various parts of Jiangbei is extremely severe, the disaster area is vast, and there are many victims. A huge sum is needed to provide relief. The Yangzhou branch has already been established, and its relief area includes the disaster areas of Gaoyou, Shaobo, Dongtai, and Xinghua.</p>
<p>▲Board of Directors to Meet Today. After President Gu and others returned to Shanghai, they were eager to raise funds to be allocated to the various disaster areas. Therefore, a temporary meeting of the board of directors was scheduled for this afternoon to report on the situation in Jiangbei and to discuss how to raise funds and how to implement relief measures.</p>
<p>▲Donations from Home and Abroad.

<h3 id="e122">The Jisheng Association Discusses Relief Affairs <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The China Jisheng Association yesterday earnestly discussed important matters related to disaster relief.

The association has publicly appointed directors to go to these areas to handle the urgent relief situation. (2) It widely encourages benevolent friends to raise more relief funds. (3) It seeks more personnel with disaster relief knowledge. (4) It transports relief rice, relief noodles, and medicines, and rushes to make relief cotton clothing. Afterwards, a gentleman suggested that he had previously seen in the newspaper that Xiang Ru and others, on behalf of the victims, appealed to the major landlords of the Shanghai Chinese and French Concessions to donate their rent to help the flood victims, which he greatly admired. He also read the letter from the Feng Jishan Hall to the Relief Association, which took the lead in advocating for rent assistance for relief, with very earnest words. This association should consider saving people's hearts as the first priority when discussing disaster relief. After careful consideration, the members all agreed and planned to adopt this important message, that saving people's hearts must be the starting point for saving from disaster, as a form of persuasion.</p>
<p>▲The National YMCA Rises Up to Rescue from Disaster. The Association of National YMCAs' executive staff had previously reduced their salaries to help with disaster relief, and telegraphed to YMCAs in cities and schools across the country, urgently mobilizing to participate in disaster relief efforts. Yesterday, the association held a board meeting to decide on a disaster relief plan. (1) All YMCA directors, committee members, executives, and staff members should, in addition to personal donations, do their best to participate in disaster relief work.

It is reported that the association has established a National YMCA Flood Relief Emergency Committee, which is composed of various directors and Shanghai-based committee members. In addition, telegrams have been sent to YMCAs in various overseas countries requesting assistance.</p>

At a time when victims are everywhere and awaiting relief, it is requested that the association be forwarded a letter requesting the Wan Guo Savings Society to transfer one month's prize money to relief funds and not hold a lottery this month. This move would not necessarily result in the gain of money for depositors, and it seems that there would be no relationship if a period were stopped, while the society spent the same expenses, and in a transition, hundreds of thousands of victims could be revived, and there was no reason to reject it. The Emergency Relief Association has sent a letter to the Association for commercial processing within days.</p>

The various situations are recorded as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e130">Yesterday Was U.S. Labor Day <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The U.S. Bridge Is Suspended for Rest</p>
<p>Dami Evening News said that today (7th) is U.S. Labor Day. The U.S. government has long been listed as a legal holiday. All public and private institutions in the United States are suspended for rest. The U.S. Consulate General and the Procuratorate in this city are closed for one day as usual. American foreign firms are also closed to commemorate it. Labor Day was created with the American Federation of Labor. The American Federation of Labor was initiated by Gompers, an American Jew. Gompers was originally from the United Kingdom and dedicated his life to seeking welfare for workers. After becoming an American citizen, he devoted all his energy to the labor movement. Because of his noble character and hard work, he was quickly promoted to the leader of the labor movement. He overcame all difficulties to form this association. Today, Americans may have doubts about the methods and means he used, but they all agree that his original intention was purely to seek welfare for workers, with no selfish intentions involved. Even on his deathbed, he still remembered the Federation of Labor. Therefore, every Labor Day, tens of thousands of American workers go to Gompers's tomb to pay their respects.</p>
<h3 id="e131">After the Wuhan Water Level Receded <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The Shipping Industry Is Planning to Recover</p>
<p>▲Rescue Personnel Go to Hankou. The flood in Wuhan has gradually receded in recent days, but the accumulated water in the city has lasted for four weeks and has produced odors, which has a major impact on hygiene. The Doujin Hospital opened by the Japanese in Qingdao has specially organized a Doujin Rescue Team to bring medicine to Hankou to assist in rescue. The team leader, Dajiro Ishida, together with doctors Eizo Nishimura and Zhizao Chen, team member Tanuma, and nurses Yamamoto and Osumi, a total of eight people, have come to Shanghai by the Dalian Maru. Mr. Kanai of the Manchurian Railway Health Department also arrived in Shanghai with them. When they arrived in port, Wu Liande, director of the Anti-epidemic Office of the Ministry of Health in Shanghai, went to the pier to welcome them. They stayed at the Fengyang Hotel and agreed yesterday that the Doujin Hospital would take the Yueyang Maru to Hankou today, and the Xiangjiang Maru would be allocated to the team for use on the upstream line. According to Ishida, the purpose of this trip to Hankou is to treat sick refugees in Wuhan and other disaster-stricken areas who are unable to receive medical treatment for 45 days and provide them with medicines. Another team will arrive in China from Tokyo soon.</p>
<p>▲Pumping Accumulated Water from Various Warehouses. The lower-level goods in the warehouses of various shipping companies in Hankou are completely submerged in water, and the losses are immeasurable. There is no way to move them until recently when the water has gradually receded. Various shipping companies in this city, such as Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, and Nissin, have begun to hire a large number of workers to pump water from the flooded warehouses and clean up the goods. The companies have shipped a large number of pumps and water pumps from Shanghai to Hankou for draining warehouse water for days. Among the submerged goods, it is reported that items such as sugar, salt, and seafood are completely lost, while cloth yarn can still be auctioned for a small amount. Metal products are less damaged.</p>
<p>▲Foreign Vessels Compete to Transport Goods. The Japanese Yamashita Company in this city has begun to proceed in an attempt to obtain the right to transport American wheat. Various American ships in Shanghai are also considering competing to transport it. British ships are planning to transport hardware and building materials from Shanghai to Hankou. Recently, various foreign ships have been doing their best to compete for this business.</p>
<p>▲Ocean Vessels Transport Goods Upstream. Since the rise of the waters, the ocean vessels of the European and American lines in this city, which used to go directly to Hankou to load export goods such as mineral sand, sesame, tung oil, eggs, beans, and cotton, have all suspended their voyages. Recently, as the water has receded, the British, Japanese, and German foreign vessels in this city have proposed to restore the direct Hankou service for foreign ocean cargo to avoid transshipment at Yichang, Shashi, and Changsha. There is no difficulty for European and American goods to arrive in Hankou without warehouse storage capacity. In addition, Japan annually transports about 150 million yuan worth of raw materials for industry and commerce, such as grains, hemp, and eggs, from Hankou to Japan. This flood and boycott have greatly affected them, and they are seeking to remedy the situation.</p>

<h3 id="e137">楊 阿 囡 謀殺 親夫 嫌疑 <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>屍體 有 傷痕 數 處</p>
<p>眞相 如何 候 偵訊</p>
<p>Yang Anan is suspected of murdering her husband. There are several wounds on the body. The truth remains to be investigated.</p>
<p>Liu Lun, the chief of the Sixth District, Third Precinct of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau in the Caojing District of Western Shanghai, learned on the 6th of this month that Yang Linxiang, a resident of Jia Yi Bridge in the 24th Tu of this district, was murdered by his wife, Yang, and immediately ordered Police Chief Zhang Bukui to conduct a detailed investigation. According to reports, the deceased Yang Linxiang's original surname was Xia. He was adopted as a son-in-law by Yang Bingsheng. Yang was 31 years old, and his wife, Yang, whose nickname is Anan, had been married to Linxiang for four years.</p>
<p>Anan's romantic nature caused a poor relationship between the couple. With Yang Linxiang's death, there was a consensus that she was murdered by his wife. Chief Liu, regarding this case as murder, went to investigate himself and saw that Yang Linxiang's body was moved to the parlor and lay supine on the coffin lid. Upon closer inspection, there was a purple mark on the neck, extending to behind the ear, bloodstains on the tip of the nose, a small broken skin on the forehead, and several red and blue spots on both legs. The body was swollen and already smelling. The deceased's wife, Yang Anan, was not at home, which was suspicious. He immediately ordered the local bailiff to report to the court and ordered the police to arrest the murderer. At 5:00 PM on the same day, Yang Anan was arrested and brought to the precinct. According to Yang's confession, her original surname was Xu. When she was three years old, Yang Bingsheng adopted her as his own daughter. Her husband, Yang Linxiang, entered the family as a son-in-law at the age of nine and had been married for four years. They had a son. Her adoptive father, Bingsheng, had passed away. On the third day of this month, after her husband Yang Linxiang got drunk, he suddenly</p>
<p>demolished the brick tomb of the adoptive father's coffin and was beaten several times by his uncle Yang Huaisheng. She entered the room at night, closed the door, and went to sleep. At eight o'clock the next morning, she still hadn't gotten up. Since she and her husband slept separately, she knocked on the door and asked him to have breakfast, but he did not respond after a long time. She pried the door open and saw that her husband had used his belt to hang himself on the</p>
<p>rafter wood in the room. She firmly denied the murder. Chief Liu, considering that Yang Anan was highly suspected of murder, temporarily detained her and waited for the court to verify the situation before further investigation. Yesterday (the 7th) at 1:00 PM, Prosecutor Wu Deying and Clerk Wang Mengtao of the Local Court came to examine the body. It was stated that</p>
<p>the body had changed and could not be determined. After the deceased's wife, Yang Anan, was sent to the court for interrogation and trial, a re-examination will be conducted to finalize the case. It was also learned that Chief Liu summoned Xia Fusan, the brother of Yang Linxiang, for questioning. According to the testimony, the deceased was his younger brother. He heard from the villagers that his sister-in-law, Yang, had a lover outside. Because they lived separately and were far away, he did not know if it was true. Today, seeing the wounds on Linxiang's body, he didn't know if he was murdered by his sister-in-law. However, rumors are frightening and he dared not say anything rashly. Chief Liu, considering that this case involved injury, decided to prepare a document today and send it to the court for interrogation and trial.</p>

<p>A giant rat actually bit a woman. It took four hours to capture and kill it.</p>
<p>Tang Xiaomei, a woman residing at 146 North Sichuan Road in this city, had her husband working on a Yangtze River liner for Jardine Matheson and was not at home. She has five sons. The night before last, her third son was already asleep when she got up to check the room. She saw a giant rat stealing the leftover rice from her youngest son's bowl. She tried to scare the giant rat away, but the rat jumped up and bit her throat, nose, and neck forcefully. She screamed in extreme pain and called for help. Neighbors and people living with her rescued her with weapons. The Zhabei Health Bureau officials, upon hearing the news, led three inspectors to the scene. After examining the scene, it took four hours to dig the rat out of the ground, kill it, and inspect it. It was found that it was not poisonous. The woman was sent to the hospital for treatment. Although she was seriously injured, her life was not in danger.</p>

<p>市府 及 公用 局 之 批詞</p>
<p>The issue of designating wharf for navigation ships. The approvals of the Municipal Government and the Public Utilities Bureau.</p>
<p>Xing Zhigang and other representatives of the Puxi navigation ship owners, because the Punan riverside coastline is gradually being occupied by ports, which prevents ships from the four rural areas from stopping in Shanghai, recently joined forces with Hengxing, Hengfeng, Yixing, Xinxing, and other merchants from the two cities to request the Municipal Land Bureau to designate the Wanyu, Gongyi, Yongsheng, Dongjiadu, and South Guild Hall wharf areas for the construction of wharves to facilitate transportation. This matter was reported in the previous newspaper. Now, it is learned that the approval states that all the submitted forms have been reviewed. It is found that public wharves are currently under the management of the Public Utilities Bureau. The submitted forms and other documents will be forwarded for review. The bureau will notify the representative to wait for the bureau to review and handle the matter. The form is stored and other reasons. Yesterday, the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau replied to representative Xing Zhigang, (omitted above) Previously, the Land Bureau forwarded the joint petition of the navigation ship owners, requesting the designation of the riverside coastline for navigation ship wharves, with a copy enclosed, and requested to handle it. It was found that the area north of Dongjiadu has de facto become a steamer wharf area, and it is difficult to designate additional navigation ship wharf coastline. It is only possible to the south of Dongjiadu, after the timber rafts have been moved, to survey and designate a suitable location for the navigation ship owners to pay for the construction of wharves. They should invite you to come to the bureau for an explanation. Later, they requested to temporarily allow the use of the Gongyi Wharf, relax the South Guild Hall Wharf, and not allow the navigation ship wharves to be located too far from Dongjiadu in the future. These matters have been forwarded by this bureau to the Land Bureau and sent to the Public Works Bureau for reference. (omitted below)</p>

<p>金山 高 吹 萬 君 之 義舉</p>
<p>Moving the recitation of scriptures to aid disaster relief - the righteous act of Mr. Gao Chuiwan from Jinshan.</p>
<p>Mr. Gao Junbin from Jinshan originally planned to hold Buddhist ceremonies in September this year to commemorate the third anniversary of the death of his grandmother, Madam Li. Now, upon the order of his father, Mr. Chuiwan, in view of the floods in the country, he is willing to transfer the 200 yuan for the ceremonies to disaster relief. The funds have been turned over to the Flood Relief Association. It is also heard that Mr. Junbin's sons and nephews, who are only three or five years old, have all donated their money for sweets to relief efforts, collecting 100 yuan, which will be sent to the charity relief organization for distribution. The original announcement of Mr. Gao is recorded below:</p>
<p>Oh virtuous ancestor, filial and kind, with complete roots of goodness and perfect fulfillment of blessings. The days and months do not dwell, and the third anniversary has arrived in a flash. Every festival, the sound of Sanskrit chants should be declared, relying on the great grace of my Buddha, one should ascend to the Pure Land early. Now, Heaven has brought disaster to China, and floods have caused devastation. The land is filled with wailing, and all are drowning. People are not made of wood or stone, how can they not feel compassion? Unfilial ones are willing to follow the great compassion of the former virtuous ancestor, to take the lead in rescuing those in distress. They respectfully donate 200 yuan for disaster relief, daring to hope that you will distribute it on their behalf. The former sages have said, reciting the Buddha and reciting relatives are originally one and the same. Using this to help, we use it to make do with a temple for the moment, and to keep those who are hungry alive, it can still fund blessings in the afterlife. A single grain of millet knows that it is of no help to the Ganges River, and it is appropriate to devote one's efforts for attaining the triple wisdom. Resident Chuiwan Gao Xiexun of Jinshan respectfully announces.</p>

<p>兩 打胎 婦人 俯首 無 詞</p>
<p>判 還押 候 再 定期 宣判</p>
<p>Abortion leading to death. Both abortionists bow their heads silently. The sentence is postponed to another date.</p>
<p>On the 18th of last month at 6:00 PM, Madam Yuan from Yangzhou, a resident of 1211 Wuzhou Road, 33 years old, became pregnant due to an affair with an absconding fellow villager known as "Big Eyes." Fearing that the fetus in her womb would cause inconvenience in the future, she entrusted Madam Gao Dai, a woman from Jiangbei, to introduce Wang Chen, a skilled abortionist from the same village, to abort the fetus for three yuan. However, after the procedure, she was sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment but was ineffective and died on the evening of the 30th. After the matter was investigated by the Harbin Police, Detective Yuan Taibin arrested Gao and Wang and sent them to the First Special District Court for questioning and detention, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xiephan presided over the further trial in the Third Criminal Court. Attorney Zhang from the police station presented the case and requested investigation. Madam Liu Yushi, a woman from Yancheng, testified that she had known the deceased for many years and that Gao Dai lived with her. Yuan came and asked her to introduce Wang Chen for an abortion. Judge Xiao declared to the two defendants that the forensic doctor of this court found that Yuan died from abortion. Did they have anything to say? Both defendants bowed their heads silently and asked for leniency. The judge ordered both to be remanded in custody, awaiting a scheduled sentence.</p>

<p>貧 不 聊生 自殺</p>
<p>A man's body hangs himself in an empty house. He committed suicide because he was too poor to live.</p>
<p>The widening of the Ximen Yi Lane is currently underway, and all houses are being demolished. Unexpectedly, the night before last, a man's body was found hanging in an empty house. Upon learning of this from the Second District Police Station, police were dispatched to investigate. A note was found in the deceased's pocket, which read "Shi Zhifeng, residing at No. 5, Lin Jin Li, Lin Yin Road, Da Lin Road outside Xiaoximen" and two lines of poorly written poetry, explaining the reason for the suicide. The original poem reads, "It's hard for a poor youth to get through the day, that's why there's no other way." The police officer presented the report to the district chief, who ordered that his wife, Shi Wu, be summoned. She stated that her husband used to sell foreign socks, but recently because his capital was short, he could not continue his business. He had been eating away at his savings for days during the heavy rain, so he had spent all his money and became disillusioned. The district chief immediately ordered the fifth district bailiff, Dong Jianqing, to report to the local court. Prosecutor Wu and others came to the scene and determined that it was a case of death by hanging. They instructed the family to collect the body for burial. If they were unable to do so, the bailiff was ordered to report to the authorities to arrange for burial.</p>

<p>Further interrogation of the case of Jiang Asan being beaten to death.</p>
<p>Chang Sanren (real name Zhu Zhonghu), a Ningbo native who collected tickets at Zhuang Yuantai Changchunlou Tanhuang venue, was arrested by Detective Shen Dehui of the Hongkou Police Station and sent to the First Special Court for questioning and denial in connection with the case of Ningbo native Jiang Asan being beaten and killed near the Qingyu Lane entrance of Huade Road at about 10:00 PM on the 21st of last month. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xiephan ascended to the Third Criminal Court for further investigation. Attorney Zhang Tianyin of the police station stated that two witnesses had come to court today and requested interrogation. According to Sun Baoren's testimony, he was a friend of Jiang Asan. He did not witness him being beaten at the time. Afterwards, passers-by said that the murderer, Chang Sanren (i.e., a Xiangshan native), was the defendant's alias. According to the testimony of Ningbo woman Shen Chen, Jiang Asan was the person who beat her at the time. He was taller and fairer than the defendant. In addition to what she witnessed, fellow villagers Wang Huang and Shao Yan also saw it, but they have all returned to their hometown. Judge Xiao verified the testimony and ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody, awaiting another date to summon witnesses for further interrogation.</p>

<p>Identity confirmed of the traveler who took poison. Wang Zhikui is actually Shen Jiatai. Public funds were used up and could not be compensated.</p>
<p>On the evening of the third, Wang Zhikui, who claimed to be a native of Suzhou doing business in foreign goods, checked into a room at the Nanjing Hotel in the French Concession and committed suicide by swallowing raw opium. The bellboy heard moaning and reported it to the police station. He was taken to Renji Hospital for treatment but died. The body was verified by the court. Because there was no way to investigate the family of the deceased, it was ordered that the body be collected by Tongren Fuyu Tang. It is now learned that the real name of the deceased is Shen Jiatai, 28 years old, from Nanxiang, who worked as a clerk at HSBC Bank. He usually liked gambling. He was already married and had children. Seven years ago, he wanted to commit suicide by jumping into the sea at Wusong Paotaiwan because of debt, but his wife found out and chased him back halfway. Recently, because he used up the funds in the bank and could not compensate for it, he had a short-sighted view and committed suicide by taking poison. His father, Shen Chunfu, works at the Zhabei Charity Group and lives at No. 470 Fangbang Road. Yesterday, his father learned about it and rushed to the mortuary with his wife to identify the body. However, the body had already been collected, so he immediately requested it back, purchased clothes and a coffin, replaced the coffin, and transported it back to his hometown for burial.</p>

<p>The examination of the female corpse drowned on Yuyuan Road.</p>
<p>The Nanjia Lane area of the Twelfth Tu of the Twenty-eighth Bao of Western Shanghai's Yuyuan Road is located in a remote and desolate area, and pedestrians rarely set foot there. There are only a few tall Western-style houses standing there. Yesterday morning at about 8:00 AM, the residents of the Western-style house suddenly smelled a foul odor that made people sick. They opened the window on the upper floor and looked around and suddenly saw an unnamed female corpse floating on the surface of a small stream (named Lujia Creek) next to the house. It seemed to have rotted. They immediately sent someone to report to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, considering that it hindered hygiene and involved a human life. The police chief, because the place belonged to the Chinese territory, sent a detective to the Sixth District Police Station. After receiving the report, District Chief Ren sent Inspector Xu to investigate. It was found that the female corpse was about thirty years old, wearing a black foreign cloth shirt and pants, with her hair in a bun, and a bunch of keys beside her. She looked like a woman from Jiangbei. Her entire body had rotted, and several inches of large intestine flowed out of her lower body. It was presumed that she had fallen into the water and died from drowning about three or four days ago. After inspecting the scene, he immediately ordered the bailiff of the Tu, Sheng Xiangzhou, to report to the local court and request that someone be sent to examine the body. At about 4:00 PM, Prosecutor Wu, appointed by the court, brought a forensic officer to the scene to examine the body. It was found that the unnamed female corpse had indeed drowned after falling into the water. Because there was no way to find the family of the deceased, he ordered the bailiff of the Tu to prepare a coffin, collect the body, and bury it.</p>

<p>Pan Xiang'e insists on divorce.</p>
<p>Pan Xiang'e, the eldest daughter of Pan Guoliang, a local resident of No. 5 Yonglu Lane, Baxianqiao, French Concession, is 25 years old this year. She married Zhang Muqing's son Zhang Yiling of Zhenjiang at the age of sixteen. They have three sons and one daughter. Due to unbearable abuse, she returned to her mother's home in the winter of last year. Recently, she hired a lawyer to file a petition to the Civil Mediation Court of the Second Special District, requesting mediation and separation from her husband. Because the mediation failed, she has now formally filed a lawsuit, requesting a judgment for separation, and demanding that the defendant pay 2,880 yuan in living expenses for two years (120 yuan per month), 400 yuan to repay the expenses for returning to her mother's home for eight months, and 500 yuan in savings and 45 yuan in interest, totaling 3,825 yuan. However, she is unable to pay the litigation fee and requests assistance. Yesterday, Judge Pang Shurong summoned both parties to the case to investigate the litigation assistance and mediate. He ordered the parents of both parties to appear in court and repeatedly persuaded them to make concessions and return to harmonious cohabitation. However, Zhang Pan Xiang'e firmly refused. Regarding the litigation fee, she requested permission to guarantee assistance and pay it after the case is closed. The judge, seeing that persuasion was ineffective, ordered them to leave and wait for verification.</p>

At Yongan Street, they saw a rickshaw carrying two cattail bags with no one riding in it, and its appearance was suspicious. They stepped forward to search, and the bags were full of opium. When they questioned the rickshaw puller, the opium carriers had already escaped. They immediately took the opium to the police station, weighed it, and it weighed 79 pounds. They sent it to the Second Special District Court for instructions. First, Gu Shouxi, the aide of the police station, explained the case and presented the opium to the court. Then, according to the report of the detective in charge, Judge Ma Shounan announced in court that the opium was confiscated.</p>

<p>The Nanshi Dongjiadu Fire Brigade has been in operation for many years. The officials of the association, from the chairman and director to the firefighters, are all volunteers. In addition to the 300 yuan subsidy from the municipal government, the remaining expenses for monthly expenses and the purchase of new equipment are all donated by members.

<p>Wang Huazhao, Director of the Shanghai County Finance Bureau, held a supplementary oath ceremony on the second floor of the County Government at 2:00 PM yesterday. The provincial department sent Yan Shenyu, the magistrate of Shanghai County, to represent and supervise the oath. Dozens of representatives and guests attended the ceremony. After Director Wang took the oath, the supervisor gave a speech, saying, "I am here as both a representative of the Department of Finance and in connection with the county government. The matter of finance, in today's terms, can simply be said to be having finances without politics. Today's ceremony for Director Wang is also a formality that does not supplement reality, but now that we are in this position, we on the one hand must work hard to manage finances, but on the other hand, we must do it practically and not be empty. For all matters related to finance, it is best to establish a budget in advance, and the budget must be carefully reviewed so that it does not exceed the scope, because exceeding the budget will lead to difficulties in completing the project and in developing it." Then, Jiang Yanqiu, representative of the County Party Department, Sun Shengzeng, Director of the Construction Bureau, Zhang Junpu of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and Shi She of the Education Bureau gave speeches one after another. Director Wang replied, "The biggest income in finance is of course the land tax, but the land tax is fixed and the career is infinite. In terms of construction, it can be said that construction begins with destruction, but in terms of finance, there is only construction and no destruction. Therefore, it is really difficult to use the fixed income to run the unlimited career. In the future, I will only follow the rules of the predecessors and follow the gentlemen to work hard. On the one hand, I still need you to teach me generously in order to seek new developments, so that Shanghai's finances do not have the danger of going off track." The meeting adjourned after the speech.</p>

<p>The Public Utilities Bureau pays attention to the city's water source. Orders the water plant to increase disinfection.</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau believes that the water in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River contains a lot of toxic substances due to the recent floods, which flow downstream and inevitably affect the city's water source. The two water plants in the city, the mainland and Zhabei, both draw water from the Huangpu River. If it contains toxic substances, it will be a great danger to the health of the citizens. Therefore, it sent a letter to the Health Bureau to quickly plan special disinfection methods for the water to be followed. It is now heard that the Health Bureau has ordered the two water plants to follow the following three points: (1) Use more alum for sedimentation; (2) Frequently wash and change the fine sand in the filter pool; (3) Disinfect the clear water with salt water and conduct strict inspections at any time to emphasize drinking.</p>

<p>Reader's Letters</p>
<p>Message from Mr. Xu Zhiping</p>
<p>(1) In recent years, the call to go to the Northwest and the Northeast has been overwhelming. However, what is the specific plan? Is going to the frontier limited to the working class, or are people in the higher intellectual circles also going?</p>
<p>Regarding the publication of plans to address this issue, and if the latter also has the possibility or necessity to go, I would like to ask how to proceed (specifically regarding those who specialize in social sciences). If there are any books available on the market for reference, please also let me know.</p>
<p>(2) The phenomenon of economic recession has almost permeated the globe. However, because our country's politics are not on track, wars are frequent, and natural disasters are adding to the chaos, the people are struggling to survive. This situation is even more dire. How many of those who received a university education in the past have now become unemployed, high-level vagrants? The solution to this problem is also one of the things that your newspaper declares it wants to contribute to society. However, I have heard people say that there are indeed young people today who can run businesses independently without seeking help from others, such as import and export business. However, I think that to run an import business, one must have considerable knowledge and means, otherwise failure can be expected immediately. Now, I ask, is this reliable? If so, how can one obtain that knowledge? Also, are there any other businesses that one can operate independently without seeking help from others?</p>
<p>(Reply) Laborers can immigrate to the Northeast, and so can intellectuals. However, immigration requires a whole plan, where to move the surplus population from, where to move it to, travel expenses, and reclamation expenses must all have concrete plans. Scattered resettlement is definitely not possible. There are many things that can be done in the frontier, the most important of which is the education of immigrants, which is waiting to be launched. As long as you have a diligent and hardworking spirit, you will not have to worry about having nothing to do in the vast virgin lands of the Northeast. If you are interested in going, you can first investigate publications, such as the China Eastern Economic Monthly, published by the China Eastern Railway Bureau in Harbin, which has a lot of substantive material on immigration issues and can be subscribed to for reference.</p>
<p>Running an import and export business, as you mentioned in your letter, requires considerable specialized knowledge and skills. You cannot engage in it blindly. In today's China, there are many things to be done. You should choose one thing according to your own strengths and do it step by step, starting from a very small scope. Do not be greedy for quick results.</p>

<h3 id="e159">The Business Community's Inspection Association Regularly Establishes Inspection Teams <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Two Steps Decided Yesterday</p>
<p>Completely Resist the Transit of Goods with Special Levy</p>
<p>The inspection work of the Anti-Japanese Aid-the-Compatriots Association has been taken over by the business community. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce's Inspection of Japanese Goods Association has already decided last week to organize inspection teams for various industries before the 10th of this month to carry out the work of resisting Japanese goods and has also passed inspection rules. The news of each item is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Standing Committee of the Anti-Japanese Association The Anti-Japanese Aid-the-Compatriots Committee held its 15th standing committee meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday. The committee members present were Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yansong, Tao Baichuan, Hou Dachun, and Lu Jingshi. Wang Yansong was elected as chairman. The following important cases were resolved: (1) Discussing the Wu County Anti-Japanese Association's letter requesting to bring in an industrial fund, it was decided to reply that it was difficult to do so. (2) Discussing Secretary Feng's report, that the association's method of verifying and issuing cotton yarn passes has been reviewed and completed, please pass the case. It was decided to submit it to the Executive Committee. (3) Discussing the proposal of the Custody Section regarding whether insurance, stacking and unloading, and warehouse rental fees should be recovered from the owners when releasing goods, please make a public decision. It was decided to recover it from the owners. (4) Discussing the case of Yongcheng Cloth Factory forging account books to seek registration, it was decided to revoke the registration. (5) Discussing the case of Huafeng Industrial Raw Materials Company falsely reporting the number of goods to apply for passes, it was decided that the visitor had not acted seriously enough. (6) Discussing the release of goods and passage of various goods, it was decided to handle them separately.</p>
<p>▲ Business Community Talk The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce's Japanese Goods Inspection Committee convened a talk yesterday with the business community of this city to discuss the progress of the work of the inspection teams for various industries. More than 100 representatives from various industries attended. Chairman Ye Jiaxing reported that the purpose of convening this talk was based on the decision made at the plenary meeting of the Inspection Committee on September 5th, believing that this economic severance of relations with Japan would adopt methods of resisting goods. However, this resistance to goods is slightly different from the past. Because our industrial and commercial circles are at the forefront of the economy, and in view of the past lessons, the current resistance to goods must be carried out according to two principles: one is to use chronic resistance to Japanese goods as a temporary solution, and the other is to use acute promotion of domestic goods as a fundamental solution. According to these two goals, we will proceed simultaneously to achieve a thorough solution. Therefore, the Anti-Japanese Association is drafting a five-year plan to ensure that Japanese goods are eliminated on the one hand, and that our country's industrial and commercial circles have a way to remedy the situation on the other. Now, speaking of resisting goods, the goods imported from Japan to our country can be divided into four types: (1) luxury goods, (2) general goods, (3) necessities, and (4) industrial raw materials. Among these four types of goods, in addition to the first two types, which are purely for consumption, should be strictly and absolutely resisted. The latter two types, from a factual point of view, cannot but be temporarily transported with a small levy before our country's domestic products can fully supply them, and the funds obtained from the levy will be used as preparations for our industrial and commercial circles to establish industries in the future. This matter is closely related to our industrial and commercial circles, and our industrial and commercial circles share the same hatred of the enemy and dare not lag behind others in their patriotism. Therefore, the association convened a temporary member meeting on July 24th and decided on the spot that our industrial and commercial circles would automatically resist Japanese goods and passed the organization of two committees for resisting goods research and inspection. Since the beginning of the process, we have been working hard and dare not slack off. Recently, the matter of inspecting Japanese goods, due to the variety of Japanese products and the situation of their import, is directly related to our industrial and commercial circles, so we know it more clearly. Therefore, at the plenary meeting of the Inspection Committee on the 5th, we proposed the method of organizing inspection teams for various industries, using the spirit of self-governance to encourage each other, and it was decided to start work on the 10th of this month. However, this matter is of great importance, and we deeply hope that our colleagues in the industrial and commercial circles will express their opinions to collect ideas and benefit widely. This is our sincere hope. As for the inspection team's rules, they have been drafted and sent to the printer. Once printed, they will be distributed to various industries for reference. Next, Qiu Liangyu, the director of the inspection team, reported that the establishment of the Chamber of Commerce's Inspection Committee is actually to strengthen the power of the Anti-Japanese Aid-the-Compatriots. Because the entire organization of the Anti-Japanese Aid-the-Compatriots, the inspection of resisting goods is a local work of the anti-Japanese movement, and the resistance of goods is mainly based on goods, and the situation of goods is known more clearly by our industrial and commercial circles. Today, when we automatically resist Japanese goods, the inspection work will be handled automatically by our industrial and commercial circles, which is also more cordial. Next, representatives from the medicine, sugar, clock and watch, mercerized cotton weaving, and other industries put forward many opinions. Because they must wait for the Inspection Committee to discuss before deciding on the proposal, it is temporarily kept secret. The inspection team's rules have been obtained and published on the left.</p>
<p>▲ Rules of the Inspection Association The rules of the Inspection Teams for Various Industries of the Business Community's Japanese Goods Inspection Committee: (Article 1) The inspection team is based on the principle of merchants automatically resisting goods, and its purpose is to eliminate Japanese goods from the same industry in the shortest possible time.

<p>Yang Linxiang, a villager from Ayiqiao Village, Meilong District, was 21 years old. He was originally from Songjiang. He married into the family a few years ago as a son-in-law. He was originally the most unhappy person, controlled by his wife's family, forcing a smile, and had no emotional interest. The patrol police of the Sixth District Third Precinct passed by the other day and saw the villagers talking to each other, saying that Yang Linxiang suddenly died the night before. All the people in the family fled, which seemed to be a secret operation. The police went to investigate and indeed the whole family was gone, only his wife was next to the corpse. They immediately interrogated her, who claimed that the deceased hanged himself after a quarrel over family trivial matters. The police suspected the matter and reported it to the chief, who ordered Pan Jinliang, the local security officer of the 26th Bao 24th Tu, to report to the local court for inspection. Wu, the prosecutor, and others arrived at the scene for inspection. As a result, it was determined that he died by hanging himself, and the family members were ordered to collect the body and wait for questioning in the court.</p>

<p>Wang Yongkang, a Ningbo native, 45 years old, has been operating Fengji Xiekangsheng Southern Goods Store at No. 239-241 Caishi Street, French Concession. At 9:15 last night, three robbers wearing white shirts and trousers suddenly came. Two robbers held guns and jumped into the store, and one robber stood guard at the door. A total of two silver dollars and 627 jiao in small change were robbed. At that time, Fan Changqi, a Chongming native, a partner from the neighboring Pinxiang Baoxian Restaurant at No. 249, happened to be in the Fengji store chatting with the store's partners. He was also robbed of more than ten silver dollars. Then, the robbers escaped with the stolen goods. The Chinese police at No. 434 nearby heard the alarm and frantically sounded the police whistle. When the detectives gathered, the robbers had already fled into the nearby dark alleys without a trace. However, the owner of Fengji did not want to report the robbery because the loss was very small. However, the Chinese police at No. 434, due to their responsibility, did not dare to delay and took Fan Changqi to the Grand Clock Tower Police Station to await verification.</p>

<p>Since Mr. Zhang Minyi went to Europe to investigate and returned to China, the Populace Printing House has used the organization of major European printing companies as a mirror, and the interior has been greatly renovated. The printing work is becoming more and more sophisticated. Due to the complete organization, the delivery of goods is also extremely fast and punctual. At present, there are many people who entrust the printing of various Chinese and Western books to the house. They have specially ordered many Chinese and Western type matrices from famous type matrix factories at home and abroad to cast new type to live up to the elegance of the patrons. After this improvement, the house is truly a rising star among the printing industries in Shanghai.</p>

<p>The Dongting Xishan fellow villagers in Shanghai have been established for twenty years. The association's affairs are presided over by the board of directors. After the third board of directors was produced, disputes suddenly arose. Luo Gantang was publicly elected to organize a temporary executive committee to be responsible for reorganization.

It was ordered to convene a general meeting within a time limit to produce a new board of directors, and the city house will be rebuilt after the new board of directors handles it. They immediately followed the instructions and convened a general meeting on the day before yesterday (September 6) to handle the election matters.

<p>Letter</p>
<p>To Whom It May Concern, The news item (Guohua Electrical Appliance Store Sued) published in your newspaper on the 7th of this month is completely inconsistent with the facts. It has been found that the Shanghai-Suzhou Guohua Electrical Appliance Store has illegally established a radio station without legal procedures, and has mixed and used the international radio station call sign (XGK XGK), and has interfered with the stations of this bureau. Therefore, in accordance with the provisions of Article 21 of the Telecommunications Regulations, the Ministry of Transportation has confiscated all its machinery and accessories, and must also impose a fine of more than 50 yuan to 2,000 yuan. After being ordered by this bureau, the case has been referred to the court for legal handling, and the court has repeatedly opened a trial. The industry has already admitted this without denying it. As for the various sections mentioned by the industry's lawyer during the court hearing, they have all been refuted by the representative of this bureau. We are now afraid that the outside world does not know the truth, and we would like to make the following clarifications: (1) (There are more than 20 companies besides Guohua in Shanghai that install radio broadcasting machines. Why are the others not investigated and only Guohua is investigated?) It has been found that this question has gone beyond the scope of this case. Guohua's private establishment of a radio broadcasting station should be dealt with according to law, and there is no excuse to escape it. (2) (Is it because Guohua Wireless in Suzhou disturbed the international radio waves and mistakenly affected Guohua in Shanghai?) It has been found that both the private establishment of radio broadcasting stations by Guohua Electrical Stores in Shanghai and Suzhou violate the provisions of the Telecommunications Regulations, and they have been strictly banned separately, and there is no misunderstanding. In view of the above two points, we hope that you will publish them in your newspaper's letter column to clarify the truth and avoid confusion. Sincerely, to the editor of Shen Bao, from the International Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation, September 7.</p>

<h3 id="e173">The Troubles Caused by the Solar Calendar <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Daiyu's burial flower poem says: (Three hundred and sixty days a year, wind, knife, frost, and sword closely persecute.) This is the ordinary Chinese people's view of the year. People from the Qin Dynasty to the present have said that a year has three hundred and sixty-five days. In fact, this common spoken language is incorrect. The time required for the earth to revolve around the sun is 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, and 50 seconds. We have now changed to the solar calendar, and we can no longer ignore the remainder of 5 hours, 48 minutes, and 50 seconds as we did before. The Egyptians and Romans initially calculated a year as only 365 days, omitting the remainder. The difference of a hair's breadth leads to a difference of a thousand miles. Every four years there is a difference of one day, every forty years there is a difference of ten days, and every four hundred years there is a difference of one hundred days. Over time, the seasons are all turned upside down. When the time came for change, the seasons were off by about eighty days. He corrected it in 46 BC. That year, he set fourteen months, 445 days, which is the longest year in history. This is a way to make up for previous deficiencies. From that year onwards, he determined that every four years would have a leap day, adding this day to the number of days in February. Roman customs only allowed February to have 28 days, and even Caesar's autocracy did not dare to change it arbitrarily, so February in ordinary years was always 28 days. Other months had 31 days in large months and 30 days in small months. Leap years now appear to have 29 days in February. But according to the Romans, this added day was called the day before March, not the 29th of February, so the Roman custom of February having 28 days deceived Caesar. After Caesar, the calendar was managed by the Pontiff. They messed up the calendar, having a leap year every three years. In thirty-six years, there were three extra leap days. Augustus corrected it for him. He was a man who loved fame. Seeing that July was named after Julius Caesar and was a large month, he called August by his own name, Augustus, and changed the small month to a large month, causing the order of the months to be disrupted by him. But Caesar's method of having a leap day every four years was inevitably a little long. Because four times 5 hours, 48 minutes, and 50 seconds is only 23 hours, 15 minutes, and 20 seconds. Each year there is an extra 11 minutes and 10 seconds, and in 128 years there will be an extra day. Year after year, the accumulation reached Gregory VIII (1583), and ten days had already been added. So he set October 5, 1583, as October 15 and pushed it all the way to the end of the year. In order to prevent this kind of error from happening again in the future, he stipulated that all century years, such as 1900, 2000, 2100, and 2200, should have the last two circles removed, and those that can be divided evenly by four will have a leap day, and those that cannot be divided evenly will not have a leap year. In this way, three leap years are reduced in four hundred years. But Gregory VIII's correction cannot be considered thorough, because there are still two or three days of error in ten thousand years.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Memorial Record of Premier's Statue Base <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Yan Ye</p>
<p>I pass by the base of the Premier's bronze statue outside the North Station gate every week, once or twice. Neither wind nor rain can stop me. Each time I pass, I linger, paying my respects with a sigh, tears welling up. For it has been long since the cornerstone of our Premier's statue was laid. Yet the towering statue, to be revered by all, is still not to be seen. Only the square foot of stone, lying horizontally and vertically, is buried in the overgrown weeds. Although surrounded by an iron fence, inaccessible to people, the withered grass is covered with discarded batting, scraps of paper, and all sorts of filthy things, almost like a place to hide dirt and receive filth. Sometimes, one even sees trousers of a calf drying at the end of a horizontal pole on the fence. The foundation of a respected Premier's bronze statue, in the North Station, which is observed by all, is so dilapidated, and the statue has not been built for so long. Is this not lamentable? This is why I sigh every time I pass. I remember the grand ceremony of the cornerstone laying in the past. I also participated in the grand event, listening to the great speeches of those who ascended the platform. It seemed that the statue could certainly be completed in the shortest period. Who would have known that seasons have changed repeatedly, yet it is still just a base? Later, due to the shame of insufficient funds, Chen Ying Shi, for his contributions to the party and the nation, has a memorial tower towering on West Gate Road. Zhao Tie Qiao, for his work in reorganizing the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, has a bronze statue erected on the Huang Xie Pu Riverbank. Is it possible that, in the eyes of the people of Shanghai, the great personality and merits of our Premier are still below those of Chen and Zhao? Alas.</p>

<p>▲ Lobster Strangles a Mouse to Death In Paris, the capital of France, there is a central market, Cen tral Markets, which is the hub of the vegetable market. One day, a fish and shrimp vendor had a basket of lobsters. Suddenly, a large mouse came, hoping to find some good things to have a hearty meal. Who knew that there was a lobster in the basket. While the mouse was slowly crawling, the lobster suddenly stretched out its two big claws and grabbed its head and neck. Before long, it strangled the mouse to death. For a time, people in the market spread it as a strange event.</p>
<p>▲ Modern Cave Dwellers Near Stourbridge in Worcestershire, England, there is a small village called Kinver. Most of the village consists of sandy rocky rocks, like artificial rockeries piled up. If the villagers want to build houses on the flat ground, they have to remove these rocks. However, this is impossible. So they made the best of it, hollowing out the rocks and turning them into the shape of houses, fitting them with windows and doors, and living inside. On the contrary, they saved a batch of labor and materials for building houses. (Hai Ke)</p>
<h3 id="e177">Remembering a Couplet Lamenting Mr. Jiang Baiqi <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Zi Sou</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou Nangai is an old comrade of the Republican Party. He is proficient in history, skilled in poetry and prose. His book, Notes from the Qilan Jing She Studio, contains many anecdotes. Since the Republic, it records inside stories and anecdotes of politics in the government and among the people, but he keeps them secret and does not show them to others. He laughs and says that I am verbally insincere, or perhaps it will be after my death. Within thirty years, it is not time to publish it. In the past, those who had seen it all praised its careful judgment and strictness. The events are supported by evidence. Using the note-taking style, it secretly records historical methods. It can use the small to imply the large, and use the simple to control the complex. His talent and knowledge are both high, and his learning is especially profound. It is a work that will surely be passed down. Occasionally, one or two excerpts are circulated, but they are merely rare glimpses. For example, the record of Su Manshu was collected and published by Shou Juan Guang Sheng in the Bi-Monthly Magazine. Later, when Liu Yazi and his son compiled the Complete Works of Manshu, because it was different from the records of other people at the time and the relationship was not shallow. (This shows the great insight of the Liu family). He did not hesitate to personally visit the people mentioned in the record to inquire in detail. (This shows the thoroughness of the Liu family). They all said that it was consistent with the facts. Therefore, it was included in the Complete Works, and two poems by Zhou lamenting Su were included. Such as "Friends still have tears, the world is already without spring. Bones are decayed, and fame stands empty, the heart is hurt, and death is regretted," which were recited for a time. Mr. Jiang Baiqi rushed about for the revolution and opened a government in the southeast. His actions and words were related to the political situation, and the case in the late winter attracted worldwide attention. He recently passed away at sea, and there were many elegies. Yesterday, I saw a couplet by Zhou, saying:</p>
<p>(Running around for the Party and the nation, trying to save the comrades of the past. Those who were generous and kind often suffered hardship.) (Weary at the river pass, still troubled by a last letter. Full of bloody words, forever recording the hardships.) Especially I don't know what he wrote in his last letter. I think it has already become a resource in the secret history. Zhou's poems and articles are treasured and kept secret, and his words are not uttered rashly. His saying "forever record" and "bloody words" must be related and have the value of being passed down. (Uncompensated)</p>
<h3 id="e178">Record of Ziyi Inkpad <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Xi Zhe</p>
<p>For anything that is expected to be passed down, one must concentrate on its path, and then one can achieve great results. Although inkpad is a minor art, it must undergo a long period of research and dedicated effort before it can reach a wonderful state. The making of inkpad has three essentials: first, the oil must be dry and not seeping; second, the cinnabar must be red and not dark; and third, the down must be fine and not broken. If the research and preparation are done properly, then the color will be fresh and thick, the mud will be smooth and moist, there will be a sound when it leaves the paper, and the imprint will be deep and fine. Only then will the inkpad have all its capabilities. Among the inkpads that have a reputation in the world, in the past, there was only the Lihua Zhai in Zhangzhou, Fujian, and now there is only the Xiling Seal Society in Hangzhou. Although there are many other makers, they always seem to lose this and gain that, and they are not fully prepared. Mr. Xia Ziyi of Shanghai has a special love for tea and inkpad making. Every day, besides dealing with teacups, he also uses inkpad making as a pastime. He has spent decades of focused effort on refining oil, selecting sand, and making down, and has unique insights. He does not spare money or effort, and does not seek profit. Therefore, the inkpad he makes is better than the two mentioned above. I also have a fondness for this, and I once selected his newly made Chensha Ousi Divine Inkpad. After trying it, it was exquisitely unparalleled. Compared with inkpads made by other families, it is more than a hundred times better. It can be said to be an unprecedented invention. Its color is pure, not purple, not yellow, like a beautiful woman applying powder to her face and then adding rouge. It is red, tender, and moist, with a kind of ancient elegance that makes people feel relaxed. All three of the aforementioned essentials are fully prepared. Calling it a divine product is truly not an exaggeration. And Mr. Xia's dedicated and focused work will benefit the art world and be forever recorded in the history of inkpads. Therefore, I specially record it to promote it.</p>
<p>▲ Letter to the Editor Dear Sir, I read Zhu Ji's biography in the "Free Talk" on the 4th, which said: "A certain famous actor played Farewell My Concubine, and mistakenly pronounced 苧 (ning) in 苧蘿村 (Ningluo Village) as 丁 (ding)." According to my understanding, Ningluo Village is the hometown of Xi Shi. There are lyrics about it in the Xi Shi play, which has nothing to do with Farewell My Concubine. There is absolutely no Ningluo Binwang in Farewell My Concubine. Moreover, both Farewell My Concubine and Xi Shi were compiled and performed by Mei Lanfang. The "certain famous actor" refers to Mr. Mei, so Mr. Mei is not illiterate. And both plays have been directed by men of letters. I have traveled north and south and have been to many theaters. I have never heard him read 苧 as 丁. As for Farewell My Concubine not containing the words 苧蘿, that is fundamentally wrong. I think the writer must have misremembered. I am specially correcting it on your behalf. Please publish it in the "Letters to the Editor" column to avoid spreading misinformation. Respectfully submitted to the editorial department of Free Talk, Zhou Meijun, September 6th.</p>

<p>— Gan Yi</p>
<p>Pei Jingfu</p>
<p>Pei Boqian (Jingfu) is a native of Anhui. He served as a magistrate in Guangdong for a long time. Some people said that he could resolve a trial with a few words, revealing the truth and falsehood, and clarifying right and wrong. I also thought he was a talented man. When Ni Danchen (Sichong) was in power during Yuan Shikai's reign, he led the so-called Anwu Army to garrison northern Anhui, holding both military and political power. Pei Jingfu was in charge of political affairs, and he consulted him on everything, no matter how big or small. Jingfu followed the crowd and only said yes, without the courage he had in the past. Many people found it strange. Fu said, "I am old. I can't help but worry about my children and grandchildren. I dare not do anything illegal." Once, he went to Beijing for something. One night, he attended a banquet hosted by Yang Jiqing (Shicong). Wang Jixun (Ruikai) was present. Jingfu, drunk, spoke loudly, saying, "Hongxian is rising. Yuan Shikai can be compared to Cao Cao. Who is Cao Pi? I am afraid that it will not be like Qin, which perished in the second generation." Yang and Wang were both speechless. The next morning, Ruikai told Zhang Zhongren (Yi) about what he had said. Yi said, "Boqian's words are what I wanted to say but dared not say. Can you arrange for him to come to my humble residence for a chat?" Ruikai remained silent. Just then, Yuan Shikai summoned Yi to discuss important matters. Yi immediately said, "Does the President know that there are officials in charge of the army who criticize the monarchy?" Yuan Shikai was surprised and asked, "Who is it?" Yi said, "Ni Sichong." Yuan Shikai replied, "What does he mean?" Yi said, "Who can be Cao Pi to succeed Cao Cao?" Yuan Shikai laughed and said, "Danchen is a soldier. How can he say such things? Someone must be using his name to say what they want to say. I think it's you, my son?" Yi's face changed. Knowing that he could not hide it, he stammered, "Pei Boqian once said this, saying that Danchen really meant it." Yuan Shikai said, "Boqian is an acquaintance. You can ask him to come and see me." Yi said yes and retreated. He rushed to Ruikai's place, and they agreed to go to Jingfu's residence together to explain the matter. Fu was terrified. He packed up and left the capital overnight. Before leaving, he gnashed his teeth and said, "I almost lost my life because of Wang and Zhang's indiscreet words."</p>

<h3 id="e180">A Husband's Wife (7) <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Hongjiao</p>
<p>But she knew very well in her heart, and her entire spirit was longing for her husband's return. She wanted to go up to look for him, but she was afraid of going the wrong way at the fork in the road; she thought about calling the neighbors who had a telephone to inquire at the homes of familiar relatives and friends, but because it was too late, the families with telephones had closed their doors and were sleeping quietly. She worried that her husband might be drunk and fall in the snow, or be hit by a car on the road, or be robbed and injured by thieves. She thought of everything.</p>
<p>Finally, a car was coming towards this side in the distance. Mr. Li had really returned. But there seemed to be a woman in the car, very beautiful and very young. Who was it? Was it his lover? Mrs. Li hurriedly hid in the darkness, watching him hold hands with that woman, watching him slowly get out of the car, and even hearing the woman say to her husband: "Come earlier tomorrow and wait for you to have dinner." The car door closed and drove away, and he was still standing there waving to the car. He pulled up the leather collar of his leather coat and wrapped it tightly around himself before starting to call the gatekeeper to open the door.</p>
<p>She was extremely angry and regretted waiting for him here and seeing such an unfortunate thing. She only felt that everything suddenly turned black in front of her, and she couldn't hear or see anything, and fell to the snow.</p>
<p>The gatekeeper opened the inner gate and let him in.</p>
<p>"You're back!" The gatekeeper seemed a little indignant and said very impolitely.</p>
<p>"Oh!" Mr. Li made a sound in his nose and walked away.</p>
<p>"Where's Mrs. Li?" The gatekeeper stopped him.</p>
<p>"What are you asking for?" Mr. Li was a little angry.</p>
<p>"Mrs. Li was just standing in the snow waiting for you. I advised her to go home, but she refused. When I locked the door, she was still standing on the road. Maybe she went to find you."</p>
<p>"She's alone?"</p>
<p>"Yes." The gatekeeper shined a flashlight around the alley. Mr. Li was also a little embarrassed and hurried out of the alley to look for her.</p>
<p>"Oh no! Something bad happened! Mrs. Li fell here!" the gatekeeper shouted. Mr. Li hurried over to look and, sure enough, it was his wife. He couldn't think of a way to rescue her, so he could only pick her up. He called the gatekeeper to shine the light and first went to knock on the door of his house. He poured brandy into her mouth and rubbed her body. Mr. and Mrs. Chen and the servants of the house also all got up to help with the rescue. It wasn't until dawn that she woke up. Besides crying loudly, she didn't say anything.</p>

<h3 id="e181">Fluctuations and Uncertainties in Financial and Gold Markets <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>▲ Complex Image Yesterday's gold price changes were unpredictable, weakening then strengthening, with fluctuations from morning to night. There was a difference of seven taels. In the end, it rose again by more than one tael. The industry sold first and then bought, the situation was complicated, and people's hearts were floating, unable to take action. Almost the silver market reported a rise the day before, opened slightly lower, but the selling intention of major players continued unabated, and finally saw a low price of 765 taels and one mace. As for the foreign exchange rate, it was lengthened by half a point, and the domestic market also loosened slightly. Afterwards, hedgers bought in, and speculators also slightly covered their shorts, so it turned mild. However, there were two or three tael plates. The after-market was initially soft, but later, because general retail shorts and hedgers were eager to buy, how could it not be high? There was a rapid advance, suddenly exceeding the 770 tael mark. However, the exchange rate was flat.</p>
<p>▲ Initial Opening Suffered Setbacks The October opening in the morning fell slightly by one tael and two mace, totaling 769 taels. The general bar already rose by one-sixteenth to three-eighths in the telegram the day before. The silver price rose by one-eighth in both public and private telegrams. It was heard that two or three more banks in the United States were suspending operations, so the gold price did not fall sharply. The next was nine taels and a half, but there were always more sellers, and it fell again to sixty-seven taels. In a moment, Tong Taichang, Yuanmao, Yongyi, Fengyong and others bought in, and it was seen again at nine taels and a half. Unexpectedly, Yongfeng, Yuancheng, Yongfu, Yuzhi, Fengyong, etc. came to sell, and recently English, Japanese and merchant banks bought in thirteen, so it has fallen to five taels and eight mace. Subsequently, Bingxing, Cuichangyong and others pulled in, slightly better by one tael. The English gold posting has increased by 125, the US gold by 25, and the Japanese gold decreased by 1.25 points, but it had no impact. At this time, it rebounded to seven taels and one mace, and continued to add to seven taels and sixty-seven mace. In a moment, Fuyu, Yuancheng, Yonghongli, Zhifengyong, Yongyongfeng, Richang and others continued to sell, and the recent English gold in September could be bought and sold at 13, so at about 9:30, it was sixty-five taels and one mace, when Maigali etc. ate December English gold 13.0625, and Yu Dayuancheng, Chengfengyong, Yuanxingyong and others took advantage of this, and at 10 o'clock it was eight taels and two mace. The Guangdong gang sold out, and recently Japanese gold was bought by Korea, only counting 1 tael 6 mace 2 fen 625, and at 10:20, it was six taels and a half. In a flash, Yuanheng Fuchang and hedgers bought in, and Mitsui ate October Japanese gold 1 tael 6 mace 2 fen 875, so it has returned to three taels. At 10:40, it was nine taels and three mace. Unexpectedly, Hengxing Qianchangxiang and others sold out, plummeting three taels, to six taels and a half at 11 o'clock. In a blink of an eye, Yu Da, Fuyu, Yuanheng and others entered again, and the bank ate December English gold 13.0625, and pulled up two taels again. At 11:45, it was eight taels five or six mace. The Indian exchange rate was reported to be a large two annas, which retreated to seven taels and two mace, and suddenly added to eight taels and three mace. At the closing of the market, it was seven taels and a half. The posted price was changed to 804 taels and six mace, totaling thirty-six or seven taels to thirty-nine taels. At noon, it was thirty-seven taels.</p>
<p>▲ After-Market Slightly Strong The after-market opened at sixty-seven taels and a half. Bingxing and others sold out, so it was six taels and four mace, followed by one tael, to seven taels and sixty-seven mace, so the bank ate US gold thirteen. Later, Zhengjin and others ate December 13.0625, and Qianchangxiang, Yuanmao Dadecheng, Yifengyong Xiekang and others sold out, and immediately traveled down one tael, and at 3:30 it was six taels and one or two mace. Afterwards, Yuancheng, Fuchang, Fuyu, Yongfeng, Qianchangxiang, Yuanmao, Yuanyongheng and others quickly disengaged and competed to buy, and sporadic shorts followed, and people's hearts suddenly rose, and the market suddenly showed sharp sales, and in three quarters of an hour it soared six taels, jumping out of the seventy tael level, and at 4:20 it reached seventy-two taels and one mace, which was really unexpected, and then sharply fell by two Xu, to one tael and two mace, and at 4:30, the closing price was seventy-one taels and six mace, compared to the end of last week it rose one tael and four mace, according to the largest price of the previous and subsequent markets was seventy-two taels and one mace, and the smallest was sixty-five taels and one mace, totaling a difference of seven taels.</p>

<h3 id="e185">Sharp Decline in Securities and Bond Prices <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>A drop of about two yuan more than last weekend.</p>
<p>Yesterday's bond market conditions saw the opening of several spot bonds, but trading remained scarce. The futures market experienced a sharp decline in bond prices, and the market was more active than before. The sentiment among buyers and sellers was particularly lively. Unified Tax, Salt Tax, and the 20 Customs bonds all saw significant activity. As for the trend of bond prices, although the current situation remains as dull as before, the market is seeing a surge in the sale of new bonds, with very strong selling sentiment. The supply and demand situation is very disparate, while buyers appear relatively weak. As a result, prices fell step by step from the initial opening in the morning. This low and weak situation was rarely seen recently. Afterwards, the decline in the market did not abate. As a result, Unified Tax, Salt Tax, and the 20 Customs bonds each fell by about two yuan, while others fell by about one yuan. Only the 96 Consolidated Sixth Customs Tax fell by a few cents. Observing the situation of the bond market, whether bond prices will continue to fall seems to depend on whether new bonds continue to be sold in large amounts. The total daily spot trading volume was 14,000 yuan, while futures trading was 1.3 million yuan in the morning and 6.6 million yuan in the afternoon, for a total of 19.9 million yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e186">Continued Stagnation in Yarn, Cotton Yarn Market <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market remains weak and the situation is quite uncertain. Due to the harsh surrounding environment and severe floods in various regions, there are concerns about future actual sales, leading many to lean towards short selling. In addition, the spot yarn trading is particularly sluggish, but the Toyo Sanpin yarn has slightly reversed to an upward trend, so a portion of the market leans towards going long, buying a lot. However, the overall trend is still weakening.</p>
<p>▲Manbiao The pre-market opening for Manbiao was weak, with poor sentiment and more sellers in the market. Each fell by 8-9 cents. The November contract further fell by 50 taels. Later, due to some purchases, it rebounded by 4-5 cents. As a result, each fell by 1, 2, and 4 cents. In the afternoon, due to good performance of Sanpin yarn, it rose by 1, 2, and 4 cents. The total transaction volume was 43,900 bales. It was found that Gongtai sold 1,200 bales, Tongyu 1,050 bales, Tianlong 1,250 bales, Taixing 2,000 bales, and Yichang 1,250 bales. The buyers were Hengde 3,550 bales, Gengfeng 1,450 bales, Changfeng 1,550 bales, Yiyu 1,400 bales, Xiesheng 1,300 bales, and Xincheng 900 bales. The closing prices are recorded on the left.</p>

<p>November 150.2, -, 100,600, February 150.6, 31,350</p>
<p>▲Sluggish Yarn Sales Spot yarn sales are dull. It is found that the total purchases by various gangs throughout the day were only over 400 bales, with 65 bales entering the trade. The market is flat. Among the customer gangs, Hankou purchased 100 bales, the interior 55 bales, Ningbo 55 bales, Changsha 50 bales, Guangdong 75 bales, and miscellaneous gangs 110 bales.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Cotton Market Weakens with More Selling <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market is trending weaker, and the situation is softening. Due to the sunny weather and the weaker state of foreign cotton, most have unanimously sold. The Japanese merchant, Dongmian, has also closed out long positions, so the market is becoming looser. However, cotton merchants still have no intention of releasing their holdings, so the market remains hard. In short, the global situation is not good, so there are more sellers. However, domestically, after the wind and rain disasters, the annual yield is greatly reduced.</p>
<p>▲Hanbiao Down 1-2 Cents The pre-market opening of Hanbiao was fairly flat. Later, due to the closing of long positions by Japanese merchants, it fell by 5 fen to 1.5 cents. The afternoon was flat, with each month falling by another 5 fen to 1 cent. The total transaction volume was 71,700 dan. It was found that Yudai sold 4,600 dan, Gongtai 3,400 dan, Meiji 2,500 dan, Taixing 2,400 dan, Xingyuan 1,800 dan, Lichang 2,400 dan, and Xinheng 2,700 dan.

<h3 id="e189">British and Indian Cotton Industry Weekly Report <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>▲Bombay The futures market was extremely quiet last week. Prices fell along with American cotton. The price difference between American and Indian cotton remains narrow. Foreign manufacturers have no intention of buying, and the amount of hedging is also limited. Local cotton merchants tend to be short. On the spot side, demand is quiet. The inter-news is better. Local manufacturers have some transactions, but the amounts are small. Japanese exporters have no transactions. European exporters are completely inactive. European demand is very poor. The statistics for the past week are attached below (unit: thousand bales):</p>
<p>1930 1931</p>
<p>Accumulated Receipts from September 1st 65</p>
<p>Weekend Inventory 62,8540</p>

<p>Exports to Europe 43</p>
<p>Exports to China ......</p>
<p>Exports to Japan ......</p>

<p>▲Liverpool Spot sales are moderate. Futures fell due to the closing of long positions and slight hedging before the government report. However, the main reason is the lack of purchasing power. Afterwards, the trend was better due to purchases from Bombay and local short covering. The overall trend is still waiting for the release of the US cotton government report next week. Egyptian cotton trading is small.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Food Grain, Downriver Rice Market Rises and Falls <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>▲South City Rice Situation The source of supply from the west yesterday was slightly connected. Retail sales in cities and towns still slowed down as the weather cleared, and customer intentions to purchase weakened, only picking top-quality goods. The price of thick japonica rice decreased by two chi, while thin indica rice was slightly available. Customer purchases were stagnant, and the local market also turned dull. However, the special edge goods were scarce and the demand was still acceptable, so the price was temporarily set. The supply of Lu Yang sharp rice was scarce and the demand was flat, so the market had no special changes. The arrival of new japonica rice and new customer sharp rice was continuous, but sales were sluggish, so the market slightly declined. A change in the weather will affect both incoming shipments and sales, which remains stable.</p>
<p>▲Zhabei Yesterday, there was a lack of incoming shipments of northern japonica rice from Changshu, Kunshan, and other places along the Suzhou River in the morning. By the afternoon, when the wind stopped, there were twelve or thirteen shipments. There were also five or six shipments of Jiangyin rice. In the market transactions, rural gangs purchased 500 dan. Top-quality goods barely maintained the original price, while the price of the middle and second grades decreased by three chi. The early indica rice from the south road was fine in grain, and although the arrival of green, thin indica rice and Shipu goods was small, the trading was extremely light, so the price decreased by two chi. The arrival and sales of Lu Yang sharp rice and glutinous rice were evenly matched, and the price did not rise or fall. The arrival of new japonica rice was brisk but sales were sluggish, so the price fell by about half a yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Foreign Indica Rice Falls Consistently <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Taizhou Rice Continues to Arrive with 5,000 Bags</p>
<p>Foreign Rice Can Arrive at the Port in a Few Days</p>
<p>▲Foreign Rice Yesterday, the foreign rice market saw another small decline. Because foreign firms were selling hard and the market price in the producing areas was also showing signs of weakening. Number one Saigon telegraphic report was at 7 liang, and Shanghai merchants slightly ordered some. Outgoing customer purchases were inactive, and price dealings between local merchants and speculators were softer than last week. 400 bags of Mindang were offered at 13 yuan 5 jiao and a half to 13 yuan and a half, and 1,000 bags of Xiaojiao were offered at 13 yuan 5 jiao and a half. Also, a batch of Number one Saigon rice arrived on the 18th, offering 400 tons delivered at the pier for 14 yuan and 7 jiao.</p>
<p>▲Customer Indica In recent years, due to famine and floods, there have been no incoming shipments for a long time. Only Taizhou's output this year is still good. Yesterday, another 5,000 bags arrived, and the price was also slightly lower than before. Over 1,000 bags of white indica rice were offered at 13 yuan 4 jiao to 12 yuan 8 jiao 3 fen, and 1,000 bags of brown rice were offered at 12 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the bean noodle market in the morning, the prices of each month's contract saw another huge drop. Because there was no major change in the quoted price of foreign wheat, and after the Wanguo Relief Wheat was confirmed, domestic long positions seemed to have lost hope for future sales in the disaster area. Furthermore, the factory's reserves are enough to last until February of next year. For these reasons, sentiment was greatly softened, and people rushed to sell, causing this month's contract to drop to a low of 2 liang and 05 fen and a half, October to 2 liang and 07 fen, November to 2 liang and 08 fen and 7.5 li, and December to 2 liang and 09. The 12th month's contract to 2 liang and 09 fen and 7.5 li. Amidst the severe floods, this degree of decline is good news for the future of food. In the afternoon, each contract rebounded by about 2 fen in the near term and 1 fen in the far term due to strong short covering. However, if actual sales do not pick up, it will still be difficult to stabilize the market. (The total daily transaction volume reached over 2.5 million bags.) As a result, this month's contract fell by 1 fen compared to the previous weekend, October fell by 7.5 li, November fell by 5 li, and December to February fell by 7.5 li.</p>

This month's contract dropped to a low of 3 liang and 7 qian and 8 fen, October to 3 liang and 8 qian and a half, November to 3 liang and 8 qian and 6 fen, December to 3 liang and 5 qian and 1 fen, January to 3 liang and 9 qian and 3 fen, and February to 3 liang and 9 qian and 9 fen, continuing to fall by 3, 4, and 5 fen compared to the previous weekend. When trading opened in the afternoon, the trading was still extremely brisk, and the closing of long positions was also very smooth, but most of the profitable short positions were also covered very smoothly, so the market stabilized and showed a slight stabilizing trend. Looking ahead, because the decline in the past few days has been huge, it may be necessary to consolidate temporarily. As a result, this month's contract fell by 2 fen compared to the previous day, October by 2 fen, November fell by 1 fen, December fell by 2 fen, January fell by 1 fen, and February remained unchanged. The spot wheat market remained quiet, factory demand was unchanged, and there were not many arrivals.

The price of pond-grown Euryale Ferox was less than 20 taels when it was at a low price, but now it has risen to 32 taels due to the scarcity of goods, which is also a rare high price in recent years. The market will not ease until new goods arrive in large quantities.</p>

<p>Farmers in various counties in the Hangzhou area mostly supplemented by raising autumn silkworms this year to compensate for the losses of the spring and summer cocoons. The amount of silkworm eggs raised was quite high. After the silkworms hatched, the weather was sunny and smooth, and the development was quite smooth. However, wind and rain caused trouble in the middle of the third sleep, and the silkworms suffered heavy damage. Now, the continuous autumn rains and sudden cold weather have caused most of the silkworms with vigorous appetites to become jaundiced, vomit black, and die by 60%. The autumn silkworm harvest this year is bound to be poor.</p>

The mooncakes made by our store at the Nanjing Road and Shilu intersection are already famous in Shanghai. Mr. Pan, the proprietor, has observed the increasing number of mooncake makers in the market. To maintain our past reputation, we have been particularly diligent this year in selecting various fillings and ingredients, even if it means higher costs. We are selecting top-quality materials for making the cakes and have hired many skilled artisans. The proprietor personally oversees the production. The weight and composition have both been increased, and there are even more varieties, totaling over thirty. Since being launched on the market, buyers...differently able to make real progress from those merely paying lip service to promotion.</p>

<p>▲ Xiaoximen Popular Lecture Hall announces: At 8 PM on the 5th, our hall held a costume lecture meeting. Over three hundred people attended. The chairman was Wang Longchao, and the recorder was Ni Zhizhan. The meeting proceeded as follows: (1) Wang Longchao lectured on the severity of this year's flood and urged the public to generously donate to disaster relief. (2) Wang Yinren and Cai Wenqing presented a comedic dialogue. (3) The costume lecture was titled "Overseas Cries," depicting the brutal killings of overseas Chinese by Koreans, exposing the insidious schemes of the Japanese, and aimed at awakening the public to unanimously oppose Japan and aid overseas Chinese. The audience applauded, showing that everyone has a responsibility for the survival of the nation. Our hall holds regular lectures, which were suspended due to the summer vacation but have now resumed their original schedule.</p>
<p>▲ Imperial Grand Theater announces: Wang Meiyu's performance of reformed new drama at the Imperial Grand Theater opened yesterday. Before 8 PM, it was already sold out. The first performance was "The Sentimental Dancing Girl," with each scene lively and striving for perfection. Prominent Shanghai figures such as Du Yuesheng presented silver shields, plaques, and other items. We heard that the audience was too crowded yesterday, leading to many casual and careless handling of ticket sales and reception. We will strive to correct this in the future and strive for perfection.</p>
