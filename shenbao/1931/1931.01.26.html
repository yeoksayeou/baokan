<p>㈢</p>
<p>（乙）孫特惠把人生活動歸納爲四方面丶</p>
<p>㈠經濟丶㈡健康丶㈢樂羣丶㈣審美丶</p>
<p>這個歸納方法丶在兒童時代丶經濟一項活動丶沒有多大的關係丶簡直可以說丶兒童本身丶對於經濟一點也不懂丶並且樂羣丶審美等名字丶冠在兒童活動的上面丶兒童自巳不容易了解丶</p>
<p>（丙）班賽爾把人生活動丶也歸納爲四方面丶不過和孫氏絕然不同丶其歸納法如下丶</p>
<p>㈠公民活動丶㈡健康活動丶㈢職業活動丶㈣休問活動丶</p>
<p>班氏的歸納丶最覺妥當丶並且在兒童生活中丶對於那種分析方法丶很是適當丶不過職業活動一項丶在兒童全部生活中丶是不會有直接的職業活動丶同時爲了要使兒童明瞭爲求學而求學的意思丶把兒童整個的生活活動丶歸納成爲四方面如下丶</p>
<p>㈠公民活動丶㈡學術活動丶㈢健康活動丶㈣休問活動丶</p>
<p>（四）生活指導的目標整個的兒童生活指導之下丶决不能有具體的目標存在丶雖有丶也不過是一種假定的目標丶並且吾們希望兒童能在他們自己的生活中丶發現些社會目標丶</p>
<p>現在吾們根據了上面四種人類生活分拆出來的四種活動定了下列的四種之活動目標丶</p>
<p>Ａ紀律的活動丶B科學的思想丶Ｃ健康的體魄丶Ｄ藝術的興趣丶</p>
<p>總之紀律的活動是做公民活動的目標丶科學思想做學術活動的目標丶健康的體魄丶做健康活動的目標丶藝術的興趣丶做休間活動的目標丶</p>
<p>這四個目標在吾們施行兒童生活指導一年後覺得需要丶方在活動中發現的丶</p>
<p>（五）生活指導的方法訓育和育訓變相的兒童自治丶偏重在訓」丶這種方法的主動者是敎師丶是學校丶不是兒童自已丶生活指導的重心在「生活」丶這生活丶决不是敎師的生活丶也不是屬於任何人的這種生活丶是附着在兒童自己身上丶從這一點上觀察丶訓育是他動的丶生活指導是自動的丶育訓是死的丶生活指是活潑潑的丶</p>
<p>再在指導所站的地位上來說丶生活指導丶不在站在兒童活動的前頭丶後方丶傍邊丶做着領導丶指揮丶和督促的工作丶兒童生活指導要深深地加入兒童活動的中間丶親密地時時加以活動的指導丶活動指導到親密的最高點丶要兒童忘記自已是兒童丶教师也忘記自已是敎師丶這是兒童生活指導的極則丶</p>
<p>㈣末了幾句</p>
<p>這個研究問題丶吾們已把過去的兒童自治丶下了批評丶對於生活指導的理論基礎丶也加以陳述了丶至於生活指導的實際丶因限於時問丶不能詳細報告丶抱歉得很丶不過丶諸位是要探究實際情形丶請看敝校出版的兒童生活指導的埋論和實際丶</p>

<p>東京美術學校鷳長正木直彥。畫家渡邊晨畝。曁隨員飯島政男·正木篤三·井上紀子·汪亞塵等。爲徵集將於今春在東京及大阪舉行之元明清名畫展覽會。與夫同時並舉之中日聯合現代繪畫展覽會出品事。於十九日特別快車由滬來杭。寓居西湖飯店。當即往訪日本領事及國立西湖藝術專科學校。順道游覽西泛印社。歸途買醉於西悅來酒樓。飽啖各種魚鮮。西湖醋魚。固屬名馳寰宇。而甲魚又係日人特好之物。尤見珍賞。咸謂東京一隅之所以有支那御料理至三百六十餘家之多者。於此可以知其有所自來矣。二十日晨。訪問陳屺懷市長。冀得其嚮導。及盡賓主之誼。奈以適在會議。僅由秘書處接見。乃匆匆辭出。轉訪袁巽初。亦未遇。以時已近午。於是逕赴日領米内山庸夫之洗塵宴。一時藝術界名流如余越園張暄初·正薌泉·商野侯·武劼齋·余雪楊·楊雪玖·袁慰宸·成田虎次郎。堤六三郎等二十餘人。均在邀請陪席之列。頗極躋蹌一堂之盛。午後訪問馬夷初。得窺新出土之漢唐古物及宋代壁畫多種。嘆爲觀止。是晚由余雪楊楊雪玖欵宴於聚豐園。席間譯及善本木刻。因知馬有宋元古本極多。遂約是日馬於午刻龍井寺素餐相邀時。携來觀賞。宴畢。謁張暄初於暄廬。以爲時過晏。略道寒暄而别。二十一爲預定遊山之日。以有龍井寺午膳之約。清晨即就道。沿途園林多幽嫻有致。就中尤以高氏之紅櫟山莊。最得袁子才所謂曠如奧如之妙。蓋高莊係由元人遺址改建而成。故林木古岸奇偉。其連理之紅櫟。則更爲不可多得者。櫟本廢材。以連理故。竟能歷四百餘年而不敗。山莊又因此而得名。幸哉。過于忠肅墓少駐。於石刻多加探討。抵龍井則已過午。即席於龍井名產詳爲研究。於是所謂旗槍者即龍井之象徵。與夫獅子峯所出之爲五突形。以及雲棲虎跑。亦各有特徵。而向所稱獅龍雲虎者。始覺恍然大悟焉。尋向靈隱進。發。至理公碑步行。歷觀摩崖刻石。於完整者均攝影傳眞。後經飛來峯一綫天而至靈鷲寺。訪玉明大師不遇。乃取道玉泉。岳墳而赴新新旅館之西湖藝專同人之公宴。並聞於二十二日離杭州。尙有余越園袁巽初张暄初王薌泉高野侯武曾保公請之送别宴。屆時並陳列各收藏家之精品若干。以資觀摩云。</p>

<p>成言</p>
<p>近月來歌舞事業又入重興時代。梅花之會。旣一開於奧迪安。再展於市政廳。更將於三十一日起出演於中央大戲院。（聞「七情」而外。復有非戰派大歌舞劇「不見去年人。」據言可使觀者如身入戰場之中。）而華南負有盛名之紫羅蘭女士。亦適於二十五日出演於奥迪安中。滬人士之有歌舞迷者。正得大飽所欲也。</p>
<p>愚於三年前。已震於女士之譽。爾時友人林視三君曾以女士小影數幀見惠。更爲道其天資之敏慧。藝術之優美。以而女士芳名。時即方寸。厥後聞有來滬之訊。因走訪馮自由君。盡得小史。爲布於一小報報端。不圖態以事離申。比返則女士表演適完畢。不禁徒呼負負耳。</p>
<p>今者。女士偕其令堂馬夫人。理事陳越生君。重游海上。愚亦以事返滬。乃嘆前者緣堅而今之福厚。因與王汝嘉兄訪之於膠州路宅第。座中更值勝利唱片公司經理潘家瑞君。互談爲快。昨日首場。復於奥迪安中。得聆清歌。暢觀妙舞。「樓東怨」本係粵曲中最高雅之作。其詞句之古樸。音調之悲哀丶蓋以女士之珠喉。乃令人讚嘆不止。諧劇「半邊鷄」女士男裝登場。則又儼然翩翩公子。表演歌唱。咸極突梯滑稽之能事。與馮自由君長公子台舞之「太戈」則步伐進退。在在中節。上座稱盛。意中事耳。隔座復值歌舞家錢锺秀女士。謂雖不諳粤語。至心折其歌喉及表情也。聞今日節目中有「木蘭從軍」一折表演服装。俱有人所難能之點。而劍舞之精奇。猶其餘事。當仍與潘王兩君。作再度之欣賞也。</p>

<p>爲創設特洛哈得教授所胡說的那多諾哥城計。須先有資本才行。於莽丹最初便從運動銀行家入手。經過許多周折。最後畢竟得到了一個想要發財的財政家帮助。組織一個法美公司以改良和擴充多諾哥城並開發其附近地帶爲目的。宣傳機關成便有許多人來報名加入。多諾哥這名字引起了全世界人的夢想。各國都有許多投機者組成團體到這神秘的地方去發洋財。第一批去的照着特洛哈得所妄說的路徑尋找。在熱帶的山中走了幾星期亳無所得。後來實在疲倦了。便在一個地方停下來竪起營棚定居了。這便是多諾哥城的發軔。後來第二批第三批跑去發財的源源不絕。人口一天一天的多起來。眞的房屋也一天比一天建築得多了特洛哈教授的妄談竟成了事實。以前灰心得想要自殺的拉莽丹現在竟做了多諾哥城的總督。而荒唐的特洛哈得教授也安然的做了國家學會的會員。並且他的銅像將永久聳立在那新建的城內。</p>
<p>我們單看這情節便知道這劇本决不是普通舞台所能排演的了。皮加劇院這次排演「多諾哥」總算盡了舞台佈景的能事。憑良心說有些地方並狠値得我們驚歎的。但無論如何我們總覺得這劇是電影劇而不是舞台劇。用四個鐘點的長時間表演在舞台上實在遠不如用一個鐘頭映放在銀幕上比較經濟而且自然。由這一點看來。我們雖不能說以後舞台戯劇將被電影淘汰。但至少這種大塲面的佈景戯以後將不復屬於舞台戯劇的領域則可斷言。至「多諾哥」一劇所包含的思想及其在文學上的價值。那自然是另一問題。值得我們細細吟玩。</p>

<p>龍紫耘道。。怎樣一班人。。稱之爲二毛子呢。。老林黛玉道。。二毛子的意思。。便是帮着洋人的。。出於一輩上等人的口裏。。稱之爲漢㚥。。北方人士語。。便呼之爲二毛子。。大槪大毛子便是洋人了。。他們瞧見有許多在天津洋行裏做事的。。和北京東交民巷出進的。。都稱之爲二毛子。。到後來也不拘定了。。凡是看他身上所穿的衣服。。帶點洋氣的。。也都稱之爲二毛子。。我有一個親戚的兒子。。他是在天津當電報學生的。。爲了脚上穿了一雙洋襪。。恰巧遇着義和團。。被他們捉住了。。便說這是二毛子了。。險些兒把他一雙脚砍了下來。。幸虧得義和團裏面。。有一個熟人。。給他說了許多情。。没有砍去脚。。但他們還要牽到祖師爺壇前去升表。。又幸虧表也升起來了。。這小子命不該絕。。得救了性命。。左詩晨道。。判决罪名。。一聽之於祖師爺。。這便是一種野蠻制度。。其實他們的殺人。。關於那一天的天氣。。龍紫耘急問道。。這又是一個什麼講究。。左詩晨道。。我也聽得人家說。。他們的升表。。和天氣是大有關係的。。倘然今天的天氣晴明高爽。。所謂氣壓不低。。那表就便升起來。。飛捲空中。。這人就有生機了。。要是今天的天氣不好。。或是一個陰濕的天氣。。那表便升不起來。。這决定是二毛子。。連祖師爺也不帮他們忙。。那就他的命該如此了。。其次。。聽說升表的人。。也有一些手法。。他們的所謂表也者。。是用黄表紙製成的。。升表的時候。。用大把燃着的棒香。。在風中一煽。。火就旺了。。將束成一捲的黃表。。高擎在手中。。口中還念念有詞。。當表燃着的時候。。可是要用一些手法。。順着風勢。。往上一送。。那紙灰便升上去了。。否則你的手一動不動。。經着本來天氣不好。。紙灰便升不上去。。所以升表人的那隻手。。的確可以操生死之權。。老林黛玉聽了左詩晨的話。。似乎很不以爲然。。便道。。也不能說一點没有道理。。升不起表來的人。。後來一調查。。全是帮洋人的。。不然。。北京城裏。。那一班王公大人。。都是讀書明理的人。。怎麽也會相信他們呢。。左詩晨道。。就是被那班讀書明理的人弄壞了。。提倡什麼國粹的武術。。什麼拳什麼拳的鬧不清楚。。結果便鬧出義和拳的亂子來了。。把這種東西。。用以鍜鍊身體。。消遣光陰。。算爲一種體操。。原無不可。。若大吹大擂起來。。便成爲這樣的结果了。。</p>

<p>在我們中國的文藝界丶無疑地是呈顯着貧弱的狀態丶即如「中國文學史「一書丶直到現在還沒有一本所謂標準的問世丶不是狭義的在作形式的機械的叙述丶就是廣義的擬包括一切中國所有的學問在研究丶但是比較有系統的丶正確一些的「中國文學史」等巨著丶它底出處丶還是賴乎日本對於漢學具有深刻研究的學者丶這是多麼使我们聽聞岂後感到極界慚愧的事丶現在丶我們回顧中國的新聞形丶也是這樣丶誰也曉得丶我國的新聞事業丶起源是最早丶然而它底發展是極形遲滯丶既不能與諸歐美並駕齊驅丶即比之所謂「東隣小邦」丶亦落於他國之後丶這當然有種種原因的丶一方面是由於教育實業交通的不甚發達丶與社會的秩序不甚安靖丶使大多數的人民輾轉於困苦愚昧之中丶未得使其參預於國家社會的大計丶而養成閱報的興趣丶在它一方面丶當然是爲了新聞體質的本身不十分堅實丶眞正對於新聞人才有深刻造詣的亦不很多丶因此丶便不能以較善的新聞紙丶供獻於一般民衆之前丶雖然丶最近上海各大報紙均在向前進展之中丶這却是很值可喜的事丶但終於未曾改進得使它成爲一個我們理想中報紙丶或許這是不久以後的事了丶至於對於研究中國新聞事業的專書丶在坊間更其是「寥若晨星」丶除了黃先生供獻於出版界最豐富的此項書籍之外丶其餘也不過祇有戈公振先生·周孝庵先生的一兩本值得我們注意的專著丶其次丶是再也找不出較善的佳本了丶這如果與諸歐美日本等出版界比較起來丶眞個相差得很遠丶這種新聞專籍的缺乏丶與及新新聞紙不甚振興的狀態丶却與中國的文藝界相彷彿丶　　實際丶一國的新聞事業的盛興丶與其所屬國的關係甚大丶現今我國國政巳次第走入訓政時間丶建設事業日漸振業起來丶那麼對於新聞界亦須有以鼓勵它丶促進它丶從事於新聞教育之提倡丶將來使我國新聞事業的發揚光大丶正可以日本的發達的情形丶所推測之丶一定有一種驚人的偉大成可言丶所以丶國内如復旦大學之創設新聞學專科丶委實值得我們底注意丶在關於我國新聞事業在正確研究的專著丶那麼黃先生這部出版不久的「中國新聞事業」一書是值得推薦於讀者之前的丶</p>
<p>這書的内容極爲豐富丶作者最先在第一章「新聞事業緒論」裏丶即將新聞事業的特質丶給予有志研究新聞事業者所認識丶但世人對於此項定論丶不外是這樣丶「是人類公共的機關丶民眾輿論的代表丶廣度的社會教育丶各種藝術的綜合的綜合丶一般人的必需品」等等丶這亦有充分的理由丶是值得供給研究新聞事業的參考的丶作者現在是根據此項所說之外丶是加以自巳研究與經騐丶而詳加伸述丶如」新聞事業的公共性」這是述新聞事業與民眾的關係丶新聞紙則應以公眾的利益爲準則丶報告正確的消息丶貢獻公允的意見丶這都是它應循的正軌丶在我人評判新聞紙價值的高低丶即可以它所具的公共性的多寡而定分寸丶這都是極形正確而有深刻見地的話丶其次是述「新聞事業的舆論性」丶這一點是非常重要的丶即如新聞紙上的評論丶有明顯的主張是不必說丶西人每稱新聞紙爲國民的喉舌丶這在我國亦常以辦報的發刋詞代表社會與論爲職責丶這就是說新聞紙必有其民族性與政治性的存在丶最初是代表國民的與論於政府丶繼則代表國家的與論於國際丶末則代表民族的與論於人類丶而使人生永遠的享受丶依照今日的情形看來丶新聞紙自爲國民與論的代表丶一國政治的隆替丶國民思想的趨向丶社會狀况的狀態丶皆可於新聞紙中求乏丶這實是極有見地的定論丶由此丶亦可以使我們明白新聞紙與所屬民族的關係丶黃先生在此書中能夠注意到這一點丶委實值得我們叙述的丶同時丶作者將國家與民族的不同點丶亦有詳細的解說丶再其次丶是論「新聞事業敎育性」丶「新聞事業的藝術性」丶這即是「集若干物之英華丶以製成一新聞紙丶福不盈尋丶而巳呈藝術之大觀」丶這實可以本刋爲代表丶以及「新聞事業的一殷性」五稱特質丶作者所論均有精密獨到之處丶第二節爲「新聞事業的定義」丶第三節爲「新聞事業與人生」丶這其中所發揮丶均爲作者生平研究新聞學的所得丶加以論斷丶第四節爲「新聞事業與中國」這是將中國新聞事業的起源丶以及它與中國的關係的密切丶都有精密的明論丶詳細的徵引丶作者在末段所說丶其他如交通上的指南車丶書寫上的蒙恬筆丶皆爲中國所發明丶而爲世界文明的先導丶我人秉這光榮的歷史丶今應該如何的努力丶乃無忝於我先賢的佳譽丶亦爲吾輩應具的職責」丶大意爲此丶但是見此節與全書的關係的一斑丶亦與我國新聞事業發展過程上的重要丶所以讀者對於此節是不可忽視的丶第五節爲「本書編輯的方法」丶即是全書的綱領丶亦有一讀的必要丶</p>

<p>Agenda Already Prepared</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Supervisory Committee is scheduled to hold a general meeting on the 26th in the morning. The agenda has already been prepared. It is said that the general meeting of the Supervisory Committee is held every June as a matter of routine. This meeting is also a routine meeting. There are several cases to be reviewed. The meeting is expected to last about three or four days. A telegram has been sent to urge Standing Committee member Gu Yingfen to return to Nanjing, but Gu is still in the hospital due to an unhealed back tumor. It is still uncertain whether he will be able to attend. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Meets with Chiang and Other Key Figures</p>
<p>Reports on the Latest Situation in Guangxi Province</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Huang Shaoxiong arrived in Nanjing on the morning of the 25th. He Yingqin, Zhang Zhizhong, and others welcomed him at the station. Those who came with Huang included Wu Tingyang, representative of the headquarters to Hong Kong; Lei Biao, former Chief of Staff of the 1st Division of the 15th Army; Huang Huami, former Director of Education of Guangxi Province; Shang Luqi, former Director of Construction of Guangxi Province; Ma Junwu, President of China Public School and President of Guangxi University; and more than 20 followers. After Huang got off the train, he shook hands and exchanged pleasantries with He and Zhang, expressing his gratitude. He then entered the city and stayed at the Anle Hotel. After a short rest, at about 10 a.m., he went to the headquarters to meet with Chiang, reporting on everything that had happened in Guangxi Province and the latest situation. At 3 p.m., he met separately with Hu Hanmin, Zhang Jingjiang, Wu Zhihui, and other key figures, discussing the direction for resolving the situation in Guangxi Province. According to someone who came with him, the people of Guangxi Province have suffered indescribable pain due to the military influence of the past two years. The central government is trying to save the people of Guangxi through peaceful unification, and because there are unclear aspects of the situation in Guangxi Province, Huang was specially summoned to Nanjing to inquire about everything. As for the cessation of military operations in Guangxi Province, the Guangdong Army is currently stationed in Xun County, Guilin, and Gui County, while most of the Yunnan Army has returned to Kunming. Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, Zhang Fakui, and others are all in Guangxi awaiting orders, waiting for the central government to resolve the situation. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Huang Shaoxiong stated: 1) He has always supported the central government, striving for the greatest unity within the Party, and unanimously eliminating the communists. 2) The Guangxi issue will be entirely resolved by the central government, and he has no preconceived notions. 3) The generals of Guangxi Province have all awakened and are awaiting the central government's disposition.

<p>(Hong Kong) The central government telegraphed Guangdong, stating that it plans to first establish a Post-War Rehabilitation Director for Guangxi as a transition, to be filled by Huang or Wu, and then establish a provincial government after Zhang and Gui have been completely reorganized. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Chen Jitang is scheduled to go to Wu at the end of the month with Li Yangjing to supervise the election of the Party headquarters of the 63rd Division. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Guo Runhua's regiment stationed in Mengjiang returned to Guangdong on the 24th, heading to the Xiaobei River. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) It is rumored that Chen Jitang will go to Nanjing soon to meet with Chiang and discuss the Guangxi issue. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Chen Mingshu took a few days off due to illness and is scheduled to return to the provincial government on the 26th to resume his duties. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Chen Yinglin, Director of the Eighth Route Army Management Office, was ordered by Chen Jitang to go to Nanjing to meet with Song to discuss the allocation of military expenses. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Qi Yiqiao and Others to Conduct Preliminary Investigation</p>
<p>(Beiping) After Qi Yiqiao and others arrived in Shanxi, they felt that the original army divisions were still holding troops and asking for pay, and it was quite difficult to start with the inspection and reorganization. They could only conduct a preliminary investigation. Furthermore, those who came from Shanxi said that it was very difficult to reorganize the Shanxi army. Each army still adopted the previous method of asking for pay. If there was a roll call, they would ask for pay, and after the pay was issued, they would not disband. If the government did not provide sustenance, they would ask the local areas. It is said that the Feng Bu has completely used this method recently. Therefore, the newly created five armies and ten divisions are inevitably changing in practice. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Those who came from Shanxi said that Gao Guizi's troops only had more than 3,000 when they arrived in Shanxi. Now they are trying their best to recruit soldiers and have exceeded 7,000. Shang Zhen advised Gao to quickly cut down the army after returning to Shanxi, saying that more soldiers were useless, so as to facilitate reorganization. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Wang Shuchang went to Beiping on the evening of the 24th to inquire about the truth from Yu Xuezhong because a problem arose again in the issue of the Shanxi army reorganization. He is scheduled to return to Tianjin on the night of the 25th and also go to Liaoning to inquire. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain key figure in the headquarters said that the news in a certain Shanghai newspaper on the 25th that Chiang telegraphed Shang Zhen, stating that Shang was fully responsible for Shanxi's military and political affairs, was completely inaccurate. Because Chairman Chiang certainly hoped that Shang could be responsible for Shanxi's military affairs, but since all military and political affairs in the north had already been entrusted to Vice Commander Zhang with full authority, there was no direct telegram to Shang.

<p>Possible to Become a Reality</p>
<p>Sir Arthur Salter to Come to China</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the matter of American loans to China, according to reports from financial circles, since Lin Bai Ke returned to the United States, American officials have repeatedly visited Wu Chaochu to informally exchange views on China's current national conditions and investment needs, and have instructed American diplomatic officials stationed in China to collect all the facts. This matter has been given considerable consideration by officials and studied by experts, and it is possible to become a reality. As for the gold industry in London, it is speculated that after the huge amount of silver flows into China, there is concern about affecting the price of gold. Japan has the same view, but it is the perspective of local merchants, who have failed to thoroughly review the world's financial trends. It is said that the American authorities, because Sir Arthur Salter, the head of the Financial and Economic Group of the League of Nations, has the motive to come to China to investigate the economy, has entrusted Salter to come to China to pay a visit and negotiate with our country's authorities. Salter is expected to arrive in China around mid-March. (Nanjing) Regarding the large loan of 100 million taels, it is said that various key figures in the central government have discussed this privately, but it has not yet been discussed in any formal meeting.

<h3 id="e28">The Release of Gandhi and the Future of India <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Generally, the means of suppressing resistance begin with severity and then continue with appeasement. The former severity makes them aware of the irresistibility of power, while the latter allows them to know that those who subdue people by force ultimately cannot sustain it. Therefore, they want to use a more moderate method to subdue their hearts. This method has been effective in the past. However, in the current era, it is feared that it will have little effect.</p>
<p>The reason why Gandhi and others of the All-India Congress are plotting to break away from the shackles of Britain and seek freedom and independence is not due to a momentary stimulus, but to the awakening of past suffering. Therefore, their actions of destroying the salt ban, opposing taxation, and so on have long put their lives and fortunes aside. Their only requirement is the freedom and independence of their nation. Therefore, not only will the results of the Indian Round Table Conference held in London this time be insufficient to satisfy the hearts of the Indian people, but the previous arrest of the leaders of the All-India Congress, such as Gandhi, was already expected by the Indian people, and it never chilled the courage of the Indian people. Therefore, I say that the Indian Governor's release of Gandhi and more than 30 other leaders to appease the hearts of the Indian people and to use this to calm the resistance of the Indian people may not be possible. Why? According to the declaration of the former chairman of the Indian National Congress, Bethael, what the British have given to India is only the shadow of a self-governing territory. All important rights in finance, finance, and military affairs are still retained by themselves. This so-called solution is not recognized by the Indian people.</p>

<p>The Dispute Between Germany and Poland is Resolved</p>
<p>Complete Victory Belongs to Germany</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 24th - The 62nd Administrative Conference of the League of Nations held its closing ceremony this afternoon. Chairman Henderson delivered a brief speech, congratulating the smooth progress of the conference, saying that such a result is sufficient to dispel the world's impression that the League of Nations has achieved nothing. Before the chairman delivered the closing remarks, the Japanese representative first presented the review report on the treatment of the German minority in Upper Silesia, which had just been drafted, and it was unanimously passed by the whole assembly. The content, after narrating the origin and facts of the case, stated that Poland admitted that it had greatly violated the Geneva Minority Treaty during the general election campaign, and hereby solemnly declared that the current administrative system in Polish-controlled Upper Silesia needs to be greatly reformed, and should be responsible for fully remedying and appropriately punishing the dereliction of duty of police officers and administrative officials, and fundamentally reorganizing the anti-executive committee of the main culprit. Finally, Poland was requested to report the details of the implementation of the League of Nations' suggestions to the Administrative Conference in May. The tone was mild but the words were strict. It was the first time in the history of the League of Nations that such a severe reprimand was publicly given to a member state, so this move can be called a complete victory for Germany. The Germans are naturally proud of this. (Translator's note: Our overseas Chinese have also suffered greatly from abuse. What do our countrymen think about this?)</p>

<p>New York News - Professor Kaimman Long of the University of North Carolina has recently invented a new method of making silk from cotton. The details have not yet been announced. It is said that if this method can be commercialized, it will have a revolutionary impact on both the cotton and silk industries. Professor Kaimman Long advocates making rayon from cotton to compete with wood pulp. The results of the experiment show that the raw materials for making silk can be greatly reduced, only accounting for 10% to 20% of the value of the current rayon raw materials. The professor said that the fundamental raw material for rayon is fiber, and cotton is the richest in this substance. Cotton linters contain 95% to 98% of high-quality fiber, which is suitable for making the best rayon. (World)</p>

<p>Li Mingrui's Troops Invade Xiaobeijiang</p>
<p>Huang Yanzhen Returns to the Province to Report Military Situation</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence - The communist bandits in southeastern Jiangxi have recently been forced by the 19th Route Army's advance into Xingguo, Yudu, and Ganzhou, and the Zhu Mao factions dare not pursue the border of Guangdong. Those who harass the villages and towns of Xionghao are only a small number of local communists who use this as an excuse to contain us. However, after being searched and suppressed by the official army of Northern Guangdong, there are no major problems at the moment. The bandits who sneaked into Shaoguan from southern Hunan a few days ago have also been completely searched and arrested by the 3rd Independent Regiment stationed in Shaoguan. As for the Nanxiong area, the 19th Route Army's replenishment of troops has been continuously departing from Guangzhou in recent days, so the communist bandits near Xiongshi have also disappeared. Although Xionghao has temporarily gained peace, Xiaobeijiang has suddenly become tense again. It is reported that Li Mingrui's troops in southern Hunan, numbering about several thousand, broke through Jianghua City, burned, killed, and plundered, and then harassed Lian County via Mashi. Mashi is only about 100 miles away from Lian County, so the people of Lian County are panicking. In recent days, the Lian County Chamber of Commerce and the Party Headquarters have repeatedly sent urgent telegrams to the province for assistance. Liu, the magistrate of Lechang County, also sent a telegram to the province for emergency assistance. On the 19th, the 8th Route General Headquarters received a telegram from the 125th Brigade Headquarters in Shaoguan, stating that Li Mingrui's bandit troops in southern Hunan invaded the Hedong Market area near Lian County and Lechang on the 10th and several other days. The 3rd Independent Regiment stationed in Shaoguan was immediately transferred to Lechang to search and suppress them. The magistrate of Lechang County was ordered to recruit 300 laborers to serve the army. The regimental commander, Deng Hui, has concentrated his troops and is scheduled to lead his troops to Lechang on the 22nd. If necessary, Wang Dinghua's troops of the Training Regiment will also be dispatched to Lian County and other places in Xiaobeijiang to intercept them. Today, the Aviation Office sent a Corsair aircraft to reconnoiter the bandit traces in the Lian County area. Yesterday, the Lian County Chamber of Commerce sent another telegram reporting that, according to reconnaissance, Li Mingrui retreated from the Guibian area to the Daxishan area of Jianghua, only a few tens of miles away from Lian County. The county police force is weak and difficult to resist. Please send a large army and firepower to assist. It is reported that the authorities intend to transfer the two regiments of Tan Langxing and Wu Jianxiong stationed in Xionghao back to Renhua and advance towards Lechang to suppress the bandits. Huang Yanzhen, the commander of the Northern Guangdong Bandit Suppression, returned to the province from Shao on the 17th due to the seriousness of the Xiaobeijiang defense, and reported the military situation in Northern Guangdong to the 8th Route General Headquarters and requested instructions. Huang will return to Shao in two or three days to command the troops to intercept and suppress the Li bandits. As for the situation on the Jiangxi border, new soldiers of the 19th Route Army have been continuously advancing in recent days. After the first batch of troops departed from Shao, on the 19th, the 1st Special Service Battalion of the 9th Brigade of the 61st Division, Huang Zhen's troops, the 2nd Special Service Battalion, Li Zhiyi's troops, one machine gun company, the 3rd Special Service Battalion of the 8th Brigade, three transport companies, one heavy equipment company of the division headquarters, unarmed new soldiers and laborers, totaling about 1,500 people, and a large amount of military supplies from the 60th and 61st Divisions were all led by Zhang Yan, the brigade commander of the 9th Brigade, along with personnel from the 19th Route Army headquarters, divided into 18 professional vehicles, and departed at 11:00 AM to Shao, and then transferred to Nanxiong to enter Jiangxi. This morning at 8:00 AM, Cai Tingkai, the commander of the 60th Division, continued to depart by luxury car, accompanied by Qu Shaoquan, the chief of the management office of the 60th Division, and attendants. It is reported that Cai has ordered the troops departing from the province to reach Dageng before the 25th and gather to enter Jiangxi. (January 20th)</p>

<p>Sun Appointed Jiangxi Clearing Countryside Supervisor</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence - Sun Lianzhong, the commander-in-chief of the 26th Route Army, arrived in Jinan yesterday by special train from Jining. It is reported that Sun's visit to Jinan this time was due to the results of the consultation between Han Fuqu and Jiang Bocheng and others, who went to Jining the day before yesterday to consult with Sun. Because Sun's troops had just been downsized and were still awaiting reorganization, they requested and were granted permission from Commander-in-Chief Chiang to temporarily postpone the transfer to Jiangxi. However, after Han and Jiang returned to the province from Jining at noon on the 21st, Sun received another telegram from Commander-in-Chief Chiang, appointing him as the Jiangxi Clearing Countryside Supervisor, and ordering his troops to depart from Caozhou and Jining to Jiangxi starting from the 27th of this month and arrive in Jiangxi by February 10th. All defenses in the Caozhou and Jining areas will be filled by Ma Hongda's troops of the 15th Route Army stationed in Tai'an. After Sun received the order, he felt that this matter had to be discussed with Han Fuqu and Jiang Bocheng, so he took the Heping armored train from Jining to Jinan at 10:00 PM that night and arrived in Jinan at 5:00 AM on the 22nd. Han Fuqu and others all went to the station to welcome him. Sun got off the train and went to the Pingpu Hotel to rest. In the afternoon, Han held a banquet in the west flower hall of the provincial government to welcome Sun. It is reported that Sun is scheduled to return to Jining today or tomorrow to prepare to depart for Jiangxi. (January 23rd)</p>

<h3 id="e59">Shang Zhen Returns to Taiyuan from Tianjin <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Military Commanders Advocate for Civilian and Military Governance Separately</p>
<p>Shang Zhen Issues Important Statement</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: Shang Zhen, the newly appointed Acting Chairman of the Shanxi Provincial Government, along with Yang Aiyuan, Sun Dianying, and others, returned to Taiyuan yesterday (the 19th) at around 1:00 PM by special train from Tianjin. After disembarking, Shang and his party briefly greeted the welcomers and then returned to their private residences. Yesterday morning, many new and old dignitaries visited Shang. The former directors, Geng Buchan and Qiu Yangjun, also visited. Shang comforted Qiu, saying that the Chairman concurrently holding the Civil Affairs Department was the intention of the Central Government. He also said that Geng would be appointed as the General Manager of Baojin Company, as Geng was originally a director of the company. In the afternoon, Shang went to the Shanxi Hotel to visit Li Guanglin, the director of the Northeast Foundry, and Li Yichun, the director of the Artillery Factory, and then returned to his residence without going to the Provincial Government. Shang plans to hold a meeting after Xu Yongchang, Fu Zuoyi, and others return to report to the military commanders on the negotiations in Tianjin, and to hope for sincere unity to jointly maintain the aftermath. In accordance with the reduction and reorganization plan set by Commanders-in-Chief Jiang and Zhang, the process has begun. Because the military commanders generally hope to implement separate military and civilian governance for the aftermath of the Jin situation, to plan a fair and proper method for the reduction and reorganization of the troops, and to urge the authorities to resolve it as soon as possible, there was an informal meeting to discuss everything. The telegram jointly signed by Commanders-in-Chief Jiang and Zhang arrived in Taiyuan yesterday, and the military commanders have expressed their unanimous obedience. Currently, the Civil Affairs, Agriculture and Mining Departments are all rushing to hand over their duties. It is reported that the Headquarters, various military agencies, as well as the Village Administration Office, Statistics Office, Likin Tax Office, Financial Reorganization Office, and Municipal Office will all be abolished. The problem of displaced officials in Shanxi Province may become a major social issue. The following is a record of Shang's statement to the press yesterday:</p>
<p>(Q) Who accompanied the Chairman on his return to Jin from Tianjin?</p>
<p>(A) I returned from Tianjin with Xu (Yongchang), Yang (Aiyuan), Fu (Zuoyi), Gao (Guizi), and Sun (Dianying). When we arrived in Beiping, Fu immediately took the Ping-Sui train to Suiyuan. Xu stayed in Beiping due to business, so only Yang and Sun arrived in Taiyuan with me.</p>
<p>(Q) When will the newly appointed members of the Provincial Government come to Taiyuan?</p>
<p>(A) The newly appointed members are not all in one place. Zhang Ji, the new member, was originally the Salt Commissioner of Zhangjiakou and is currently in Zhangjiakou. Chang Bingyi is the director of the Hebei Agriculture and Mining Department. Hu Yiling is a member of the Jin Army Inspection Committee and is currently in Beiping. They should arrive in Taiyuan in a day or two.</p>
<p>(Q) When will the Chairman of the Provincial Government and the members take office?</p>
<p>(A) The date for the reorganization of the Provincial Government will be determined after the members arrive in the province. My taking office as Chairman will also be at that time.</p>
<p>(Q) Is the military reorganization fee secured? How will the surplus officers and soldiers be settled?</p>
<p>(A) I have brought back 450,000 yuan for the reorganization fee. Vice Commander Zhang has secured 2 million yuan in Tianjin. The surplus soldiers will be given funds to return to their hometowns. Officers, except for those appointed as division or brigade commanders, will be sent to Beiping to establish a military academy, maintaining their original salaries, to pursue further studies.</p>
<p>(Q) The Chairman's return to Jin this time will surely bring a new look to Shanxi's politics. Please tell us the main policy directions.</p>
<p>(A) I have just arrived in Taiyuan and do not have specific political plans to announce. However, I have three hopes for Shanxi's politics in the future: (1) To ensure that the people of Shanxi achieve a peaceful life. (2) To reduce the burden on the people as much as possible. (3) To select talented individuals to participate in politics.</p>
<p>(Q) From where will the military expenses be drawn in the future?</p>
<p>(A) Since the Shanxi garrison has been reorganized by Vice Commander Zhang, the military salaries of all the troops will be paid from the Central Government's revenue. After the troops are reorganized, the military expenses will be paid by the Deputy Commander's Office.</p>
<p>(Q) Since the Jin banknotes plummeted, the people of the province have been greatly affected. How will the Chairman reorganize the Jin banknote issue?</p>
<p>(A) The Jin banknote issue is related to the survival of the people of Shanxi. I will thoroughly reorganize it. I have discussed it many times with Minister Lai in Tianjin. Minister Song has personally promised to maintain it. Song returned to Beijing the night before last. After returning to Beijing, he will send a senior official to Shanxi to inspect and arrange for funds from the Central Government to be used as the foundation for reorganizing the Jin banknotes. I will definitely make the price of Jin banknotes rise greatly in the near future.</p>
<p>(Q) After the abolition of the likin tax, how will the deficit be compensated?</p>
<p>(A) The likin tax, an evil tax, must be abolished. As for the compensation method, in addition to the special consumption tax, business tax, and nineteen other taxes, the shortfall will be prepared by the Central Government.</p>
<p>(Q) Will there be any changes in the organization of various agencies?</p>
<p>(A) The organization of all agencies will be determined in accordance with the Central Government's organization law. The Chairman concurrently serves as the head of Civil Affairs, as is generally the case in other provinces. All other redundant agencies will be abolished in the near future. (20th)</p>
<h3 id="e60">Li Chen, Special Commissioner of the Sino-Russian Conference, Returns Home for Medical Treatment <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Li Will Accompany Mo Dehui to Beijing</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: Li Chen, a specialist assigned by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to accompany Mo Dehui to the Russian conference, has returned to China on leave for medical treatment due to illness in Russia. He departed from Moscow on the 11th of this month, accompanied by Nan Wenming, a member of the delegation. He arrived in Harbin at 8:30 AM on the 20th. He plans to stay in Harbin for several days before going to Liaoning to accompany Mo Dehui to Beijing. When Mr. Li was in Harbin, he told visitors that the reason the Russian side did not insist on the Boli (Khabarovsk) Record was that its demand for expanding the scope of the conference had already achieved its purpose, so it stopped at the right time. The future of the conference should not face any more obstacles. As for whether the Soviet Russian side is sincere, it is also difficult to say, because the benefits of international conferences are all in one's own favor. If each other can understand the interests of both sides and have less hesitation, they can negotiate frankly. When Plenipotentiary Mo returned to China, there was not much criticism from Russian public opinion, because in bilateral conferences, it is also appropriate for the plenipotentiary to return home for instructions. It was rumored that the conference had stopped after Plenipotentiary Mo returned to China, but in fact, it did not stop. Naturally, things were reduced after the main person left. Plenipotentiary Mo left Russia on December 21 last year, and December 25 was Jesus' Christmas Day. The world regards this as a major event, so the Soviet Union also took a holiday to celebrate. Connecting to the New Year, the delegation took a vacation, and both sides stopped working, so there was nothing to do. I originally had stomach problems, which recurred after arriving in Russia. Since autumn, the Russian capital has not seen the sun for several months, so it was a little difficult to take care of myself. Also, the Russian capital prohibits the import of medicines, so although there are famous doctors, it is extremely difficult to buy medicines. Often, I can buy it this time, but I cannot find it next time. Plenipotentiary Mo returned to China, and the delegation's official duties were simple, so I asked for leave to return home for treatment. I plan to return to Russia with Plenipotentiary Mo within three months. If I recover within one or two months, I will go to Russia early. If I meet Plenipotentiary Mo in Liaoning, I will go south with him. If Plenipotentiary Mo stays in Liaoning for several more days, I will go to Beijing first, etc. (20th)</p>
<h3 id="e61">The Case of the Robbery on the Siping-Taonan Railway is Solved <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Three Criminals Have Been Interrogated and Executed</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: Sun Xuchang, the Director of the Liaoning Police Department, previously reported that Li Shutian, the Suppression Officer, and Fu Duolin, the Chief of the Liaoyuan County Public Security Bureau, reported that they had detected three main offenders in the Siping-Taonan Railway robbery case last year, namely Wu Yanshan, Gao Fuchen, and Li Hui, and recovered four large and small guns. The Provincial Government approved the report, and the Department replied to Liaoyuan, instructing them to interrogate the criminals and execute them on the spot to enforce the law. Later, it was reported that the Siping-Taonan robbery was directed by the bandit leader Sao Bei and approved by the two bandit leaders Tianxia Hong. They gathered and discussed at Wu Yanshan's nitrate pot at Boli Mountain Station and set off from Wu Yanshan's home on the evening of December 7. Wu Yanshan, Gao Fuchen, Li Hui, and others accompanied them. When they arrived south of Boli Mountain, many people had gathered. The total number was 47 people, and the shares for guns and horses totaled 147. They stopped for a meal once when they reached Da Tu Mountain. The next morning, they arrived at the robbery site near Shanshaozi and hid. Several days later, they captured the railway workers near Shanzuizi and forced them to remove the spikes, dismantling three sections. When the train arrived, it suddenly derailed, and a first-class and second-class carriage were overturned. They swarmed up at once. Although the railway police resisted, they were outnumbered and robbed. A total of more than 2,000 yuan in cash and eight small guns were robbed. After the robbery, they went north to Huanghuadianzi to divide the spoils, with each share receiving 60 yuan. The bandit leader Sao Bei took five guns, Tianxia Hong took two, and Shuangshan took one, etc. It was found that the criminals were captured because the Chief of the Liaoyuan Public Security Bureau disguised himself for interviews and purchased service lines. On the evening of the 4th of this month, a secret agent reported it. A large team was dispatched to capture Wu Yanshan and two box cannons were found on the spot, one belonging to Sao Bei and one robbed from the Siping-Taonan Railway. Subsequently, Gao Fuchen and Li Hui, accomplices, were confessed and were arrested together. Li Hui also confessed that he had hidden guns at Zhao Fengting's home, where two large guns, one Type 38 and one Russian Lianqiu, were recovered. The Bureau interrogated and confirmed the facts and immediately reported to the Police Department for review. On the 17th, a provincial order was received. The criminals Wu Yanshan (reported name Zhenhai), Gao Fuchen (reported name Dajiuzi), and Li Hui (reported name Zhanjiang) were taken from the prison, identified and executed by shooting. (22nd)</p>
<h3 id="e62">Second Trial of the Judge Ha Murder Case <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>(Continued)</p>
<p>Next, Judge Zhang Wang Liqing (asks): You are called Zhang Liqing? (Answers): Zhang Liqing is me. (Asks): How old are you? (Answers): Thirty-two years old. (Asks): Where do you live? (Answers): I currently live in Shou Shan Hospital. (Asks): Where are you from? (Answers): Beijing. (Asks): What is your maiden name? (Answers): Wang. (Asks): Were you Zhang Ziming's wife or concubine? (Answers): Wife. (Zhang speaks with a heavier tone). (Asks): What did Zhang Ziming do when he was alive? (Answers): Please forgive me, Judge, because I am not well enough to speak much. Please ask important questions. This is not important, please don't ask it. (Zhang lowers her head as if embarrassed.) The judge agrees. He explains to Zhang, saying, "This point is important, and it must be asked. You know that this case has been delayed for two hearings, which is very uneconomical. If this is not clarified this time, it will have to be asked again next time. Rather than asking multiple times, it is better to ask it all at once. Don't be shy. While shyness is understandable, when things come to this point, it can't be helped. Moreover, it is now a public social matter, and this is not much." After the judge finishes speaking, Zhang answers, "Long-distance telephone bureau," her voice extremely soft, almost imperceptible. The judge then asks, "Did you send your husband's spirit back to Beijing last year during the Double Tenth Festival?" (Answers): Yes. (Asks): When did you meet Ye Yixiong? (Answers): I knew him when my husband was alive. (Asks): You returned to Beiping last year during the Double Tenth Festival and came back this January, is that right? (Answers): Yes. (Asks): What was the matter when you returned from Beiping? (Answers): It was about the capital and deposits of Nengxing Sauce Garden. (Asks): Has the capital of Xie Xing Sauce Garden been withdrawn now? (Answers): Not withdrawn. (Asks): Were the deposits withdrawn? (Answers): They were withdrawn. (Asks): When did your love affair with Ye Yixiong begin? (Answers): After the Double Tenth Festival in the eighteenth year. (Asks): Have you ever stored all your belongings at Ye Yixiong's place? (Answers): Indeed, I have stored many things. (Asks): Did he also help you when you made deposits? (Answers): He helped. (Asks): Why did you return to Beiping this time? (Answers): To go home and see. (Asks): Weren't you going back to marry Liu Kelong? (Answers): Yes. (Asks): Did Ye Yixiong handle the remittance of money when you returned to Beiping? (Answers): Because I was sick and couldn't go, I asked him to handle it. (Asks): How much money did you give him? (Answers): Originally, there was money deposited in the bank, a total of five deposit slips: two Hanyang (silver dollars), two Tianjin yang (silver dollars), and one red deposit slip for the business part. Because a bank deposit slip could only hold 5,000 yuan. (Asks): Then, did you give him an additional 800 yuan besides the 7,050 yuan remitted? (Answers): Because the deposit was not enough to remit 7,050 yuan, I gave him an additional 800 yuan for remittance fees and to buy train tickets. (Asks): Did he also handle the train tickets? (Answers): He handled them. (Asks): Did you give him your personal seal when remitting the money? (Answers): Taking money from the bank requires a seal to be valid, so I gave him the seal. (Asks): Ye Yixiong remitted the money from the Bank of Communications, but he didn't give you the check back? (Answers): I was originally scheduled to leave on the 21st, but because of diarrhea and some delays, I couldn't leave, so I asked him to keep the check to avoid mistakes at Xie Xing Sauce Garden. Because he is usually very reliable in handling things, I didn't suspect him. (Asks): Is a guarantor required to withdraw money in Beiping? (Answers): Banks do not pay without a guarantor. (Asks): Did he go with you when you returned to Beiping? Did you ask him to, did he ask you, or did he have something to do in Beiping? (Answers): I didn't ask him, and he didn't ask me. Because the scenery in Beiping is good, both of us agreed to go to Ping to play. (Asks): According to your original statement, you were going to marry Liu Kelong, is that right? (Answers): Yes, but I hadn't told him about the marriage when we got engaged. I had implicitly indicated it to him. This time, when I returned to Ping, I didn't plan to come back. (Asks): He is employed and would not have had time to send you off. Because you were marrying Liu and not returning, he sent you off despite the long distance, which shows his loyalty and sincerity. (Answers): Yes. (Asks): On what day did you tell him about marrying Liu? (Answers): I had implied it before getting on the train, but I hadn't mentioned it before. (Asks): You hadn't said it before? (Answers): I hadn't said it before. (Asks): Exactly where did you indicate it? Think about it, don't rush. At this point, Zhang asks the judge to allow her to think. She then (answers), saying that she had indicated it when they went to a small Russian restaurant to eat before leaving. (Asks): What day? (Answers): I don't remember. (Asks): You need to speak clearly, otherwise, it cannot be recorded. At this point, Zhang says again, "Judge, forgive me for not being in good spirits, allow me to think." The judge says, "Okay, you can think more if you want." (Answers): That day, before boarding the train, I indicated it in the dining car. (Asks): What was his reaction when you said this? (Answers): There was no reaction. (Asks): Did you board the train after that? (Answers): I boarded the train. (Asks): Did you sit in a second-class sleeper? (Answers): Yes. (Asks): Were you in the same room? (Answers): Yes. (Asks): Is a second-class room for four people? (Answers): Yes, a room for four people. (Asks): What did you say between when the train started and before arriving at Shuangcheng? (Answers): After boarding the train, we drank tea in the corridor and talked about what places had good scenery. Later, I said I wanted a cigarette, but the cigarettes were in my purse, so I gave him the key and asked him to open the purse and get the cigarettes. The judge wants to clarify that he didn't trick me into giving him the key. (Asks): He said he was changing clothes. Where had the train arrived at that time? (Answers): Because I am usually a careless person, I didn't pay attention. (Asks): Did he change his clothes? (Answers): I don't know. (Asks): What did he say when the train arrived at Shuangcheng Station? (Answers): He said there was a place with good scenery that we could go see. Because I wasn't familiar with Shuangcheng, we got off the train together. That day, I was wearing leather shoes, and the road was slippery. We didn't walk far after getting off the train before the train started moving. I was so anxious that I scolded him. Because I slipped and fell after chasing the train for only a few steps. (Asks): He said there was good scenery to see, didn't you ask him how long the train would stop? (Answers): He said the train would stop for ten minutes at this station and fifty minutes at the next station, a total of sixty minutes, so we could catch up with the train. (Asks): Catch up with the train at the next station? (Answers): Yes, because the train started moving, we rushed forward, and I slipped and fell. (Asks): You know that when going out, you shouldn't leave the platform when getting on and off the train? (Answers): That day, I was really careless. (Asks): Your original statement said that the road was difficult to walk after getting off the train, and he even helped you. Is that true? (Answers): Yes. (Asks): Your original statement said that you cried and scolded him, and he even said to you, "Good sister, I'm sorry." Is that true? (Answers): We didn't walk far after getting off the train. Because the shoes were slippery, I didn't want to walk, so I scolded him. I lost my temper. (Asks): Was it pushed down, or did you slip and fall? (Answers): It was a slip and fall, I admit that. (Asks): Why did you say in your statement to the Shuangcheng police that you were pushed? (Answers): I told the judge that I didn't make a statement in Shuangcheng. (Asks): If you didn't make a statement in Shuangcheng, how would they know what clothes Ye Yixiong was wearing, how he was dressed, and how he committed the crime on the third day? (Answers): That was after they saved me and gave me a strong injection. I only described his appearance. I didn't say anything else, and there was no statement. (Asks): You said that you fell because you slipped, not because you were pushed. Did you see him take out a gun? (Answers): I didn't see it. (Asks): You only knew after you were shot? (Answers): Yes. (Asks): From when you got off the train until you slipped and fell, did you ever see him take out a gun? (Answers): I didn't see it before. I lost my temper later and didn't know if he had a gun or not. (Asks): When he was helping you walk, didn't you say that a bandit took out a gun? (Answers): No. (Asks): After he shot you, were you conscious? (Answers): After being shot, I lay down. When I looked back, Ye Yixiong was not in front of me. I saw a person holding a lantern and then shouted for help. (Asks): After he shot you, you didn't see anything else and only saw someone with a lantern coming? (Answers): Not long after, a person with a lantern came, and I shouted for help. (Asks): The slip and fall was on flat ground? (Answers): The ground was covered with snow, I don't know if it was flat ground. (Asks): Were there any pits? (Answers): There were deep pits under my feet. (Asks): How deep were they? (Answers): About above my knee. (Asks): After the person with the lantern came, what did they say? (Answers): He asked if I was a person or a ghost. I answered that I was a person, told him how I was injured, and was very scared. He said that one person couldn't save me and called for several more people. They carried me up with a bed, and I didn't know anything after that. (Asks): When you gave him the key to get the cigarettes until you got off the train, did he show any expression or dissatisfaction? (Answers): He went back into the room a second time to change his pants. When I spoke, he ignored me. (Asks): What else did you say on the road between getting off the train and slipping and falling? (Answers): I didn't say anything because I was angry. (Asks): Didn't he say, "Good sister, I'm sorry"? (Answers): He did say that, but I was angry and said, "You damned thing, you're hateful. Who would want to go with you?" He said, "You don't want to go with me? You want to go with Liu Kelong?" I said, "I'm going with him, what's it to you? It's a righteous thing." He didn't say anything. (Asks): Before you left, did you ever ask to marry him? (Answers): I asked him in the eighteenth year. He said it couldn't be done because there were various difficulties. I returned to Ping on March 1 of the nineteenth year and came to Ha on May 3. I got engaged to Liu Kelong when I returned to Ping. (Answers): Why did you get off the train at Shuangcheng, and why did he shoot you with a gun at Maozi Tomb? Do you know? (Answers): I can't figure out what it means. (Asks): Was it for your money, because you were marrying Liu Kelong, or was he jealous, or for some other reason? (Answers): If it was for money, he wouldn't admit it. Because valuable items and money have been stored with him many times, this time it was just a small amount. (Asks): You mean it wasn't necessarily for adultery or money? (Answers): It wasn't for money, because I had returned to Beiping several times before, and he had sometimes seen me off on the train. The amount of money was even greater than this, and he managed it all. Why didn't he do it then? (Asks): He thought you wouldn't return, that you would definitely end the relationship, and that you were marrying someone else in Beiping. Although this time the money wasn't as much as before, he thought you weren't coming back, so he did this. Isn't that right? (Answers): I don't think it was for money. If it was for money, there was a lot of money before. He could have just married me, wouldn't that have been easier? (Asks): After he shot you, did he touch anything on your body? (Answers): He didn't touch anything. After shooting me, he ran far away. (Asks): Did you take your luggage down when you got off the train? (Answers): I didn't take anything down when I got off the train. (Asks): Has he seen the letters between you and Liu? (Answers): I didn't want to show him, and he usually doesn't read my letters. (Asks): Last year, there was a letter in which you mailed ten yuan because it was Liu Kelong's father's birthday, asking him to buy birthday gifts. Has he seen that? (Answers): I'm really careless. I don't know if he saw it or not. (Asks): Has he seen the letter you sent to Liu with mooncakes? (Answers): I don't know. (Asks): Was this letter in the box when you boarded the train? (Answers): It was in the big suitcase. (Asks): Did he see it when he opened the suitcase? Do you know? (Answers): I don't know. (Asks): Had he seen this letter before you left? (Answers): He usually doesn't see my letters. (Asks): What does the mooncake in the letter you gave Guan mean? (Answers): It means the Mid-Autumn Festival. (Asks): There's also a letter Ye Yixiong wrote to you that says, "My dear, if you don't come back for a day, I'm leaving. True love is eternal, it doesn't care about a moment. I've been so busy these past few days that I've forgotten everything. You probably know that, not only busy but also sick, because I've had a headache and haven't been in good spirits these past few days. If you like me, you'll naturally forgive me, and I don't need to beg you. I'll come see you again tomorrow at twelve o'clock. Please wait for me. Yun, afternoon five o'clock on the nineteenth." Does this letter exist? (Answers): Yes. (Asks): Is it the 19th of what month last year or the 19th of what month this year? (Answers): I don't remember clearly. (Asks): The word Yun at the end, does it mean Ye's name, Yiyun? (Answers): Yes. (Asks): Is the love character in red pen on the letter written in blood, or was it dyed with something? What is the meaning? (Answers): I don't know. (Asks): Was it there originally, or did someone add it? (Answers): I don't know. (Asks): Before this incident, you gave him four thousand yuan and asked him to deposit it because he didn't believe in you, which can prove that you were sincere. Is that true? Zhang doesn't answer. The judge tells her to think and tells her that this is just an ordinary point. Zhang then (answers): That was once before I returned to Ping for the first time. (Asks): After you came back this January, did you indeed give him four thousand yuan before you left this time? (Answers): There was once. (Asks): Did you take everything with you when you left this time? (Answers): I took everything. (Asks): Are you still storing anything at Ye Yixiong's place? (Answers): That's just a bank interest check. (Asks): Today, you have appointed lawyer Chi Longshi to represent you in the civil case, seeking compensation for losses. What is the purpose? (Answers): Because the postman and the police who saved me in Shuangcheng are my benefactors, I should certainly reward them with some money. (Asks): Is there anything else? (Answers): Yes, there were many people who saved me that day. (Asks): What you are asking for is because the people who saved you were kind to you, and you plan to have him compensate so you can repay them, is that right? (Answers): Yes. (Asks): How much do you want? (Answers): If I want it, I want a lot. If I don't want it, I don't want a penny. The lawyer will decide. (Asks): This is your right. The lawyer is just representing your meaning. You still have to say it yourself. How much do you want? (Answers): At least three to four thousand yuan. (Asks): In summary, your meaning is between three thousand and four thousand, is that right? (Answers): Yes.</p>
<p>At this point, the judge turns to question Ye Yixiong about Zhang Liqing's statement, asking if he has any opinions. Ye says that Ms. Zhang said she implicitly indicated to me that she was going to marry Liu Kelong. Please, Judge, ask her how she indicated it. I had no idea at all. I didn't see the letter. I didn't know she was going back to Beiping to marry someone. When I saw the letter, I was completely unwilling in my heart. The judge asks Zhang Liqing how she implicitly indicated it. Zhang answers that she implied that after returning to Ping, we would probably see each other less in the future. After hearing this, Ye is speechless. The judge then speaks, saying, "According to what you, Ye Yixiong, have stated, you killed Zhang Liqing on a sudden impulse. According to Zhang Liqing's statement, she had already told you that she would not return after going to Ping. You killed her, and she didn't know anything about it beforehand. Your statements are completely contradictory." Ye then asks the judge to ask Zhang Liqing if the previous events were as he described. The judge rejects this, saying, "Before, you were just on good terms. You spent her money, and she used your money. You were always together and played together. That is unrelated to this case. What is the need to ask?" At this point, the defendant's lawyer, Lü Fan, speaks, asking the judge to ask Zhang Liqing if she had ever seen Ye Yixiong carrying a handgun when they were playing by the river at the Eighth Station last August. Zhang answers that she seemed to have seen it. The judge tells Zhang that she must tell the truth and not speak vaguely. Zhang says that she had seen him have a toy handgun before. The defendant then asks the judge to ask Zhang how she scolded Ye on the road after getting off the train in Shuangchengbao. Zhang answers that she scolded him, "You evil ghost, you're nothing. Don't you know I have things to do in Beiping? Who would want to go with you?" The defendant's lawyer then asks the judge to ask Zhang exactly how she indicated to Ye that she was going to marry him in the dining car. Zhang then becomes impatient, asking the judge why the lawyer is asking about this. The judge tells her that it is for the record and that she must state it again and tells her that now men and women have equal rights. Men have girlfriends, and women have boyfriends. Things have reached this point, so don't be shy and should speak directly. Zhang answers that she roughly indicated that this time, when she returned to Ping, it would be at least three years before she could come to Ha again, and we would see each other less in the future. He asked what exactly was happening. I said that I was probably getting married this time when I returned to Ping. (Asks): Didn't he ask you who you were marrying? (Answers): He asked. I said I was marrying Liu Kelong. (Asks): Did he not ask anything after that? (Answers): The things he said after that are irrelevant to this case. The defendant's lawyer stands up and speaks, asking the judge to pay attention. What the plaintiff just stated was not an implicit indication, but wasn't it a clear indication? The judge then asks Zhang again if what she just said was true. Zhang answers that it was true. The judge asks the defendant's lawyer if he has any opinions. The lawyer answers that the witnesses in this case are not complete and that he will express his opinions at the next hearing. The judge then asks the plaintiff's lawyer, Chi Longshi, if he has any opinions. Chi stands up and speaks, stating that he only represents the civil part of the plaintiff's case, requesting compensation for damages, including 500 yuan to repay the Shuangcheng postman, 100 yuan to the police, 150 yuan for the Central Hospital nurse, 400 yuan for Shou Shan Hospital medical expenses, 150 yuan for postal and tram fares, and losses for the lost gold watch, etc., about 200 yuan, totaling 1,460 yuan. Due to the mental health damage caused by the attempted murder, he should be compensated 3,000 yuan, for a total of 4,650 yuan. At this point, it is 4:35 PM. The judge then announces an adjournment and will summon the Xie Xing Sauce Garden Wang Songtao couple to court for a retrial at the next hearing. (19th)</p>

<h3 id="e65">Memorial Request for Hu Qian by Jiang Fusheng et al. <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>A memorial from Jiang Fusheng, Brigade Commander of the 3rd Brigade of the National Government Guard Division, and others to General Commander Chiang reads: "It is reported that Hu Qian, the former Division Commander of the 18th Division and concurrently the Garrison Commander of Huizhou, on October 6th, 1927, received a telegram order from Li, the General Commander of the 8th Route Army of the National Revolutionary Army, to lead his troops to Heyuan and Xingning to intercept the remnants of Ye and He's rebel forces. He immediately obeyed the order and dispatched his troops. During the troop movement, Li Hanhun, the Division Commander of the 25th Division of the former 4th Army, under the instruction of Zhang Fakui, a rebel, suddenly led his troops to surround and attack the headquarters of the 18th Division. Hu Qian was unfortunately captured. Li Hanhun then coerced Hu Qian into issuing a telegram to order the 18th Division's troops back to Huizhou for reorganization. Hu Qian swore to die rather than comply and was subsequently murdered. Hu Qian's death was due to his refusal to join the rebellion and his loyalty to the Party and the nation. Hu Qian has been dead for years, his grievances have not been redressed, and his family is destitute, with orphans and widows struggling to raise their children. Fusheng and others, as his former subordinates, cannot bear to see this. Previously, we presented a report detailing the tragic death of Hu Qian and the plight of his family, requesting a review, but no instructions were received. Now, we jointly appeal again to your Excellency, begging for your clear judgment and earnestly requesting that preferential treatment be granted to his family according to the regulations for fallen soldiers, and that the National Government be requested to issue a decree commending his loyalty so that his loyal spirit may be comforted in the afterlife, and his family may be able to survive. This will not only move the Hu family but will also encourage all loyal comrades throughout the country. We respectfully submit this urgent plea and await your orders." The memorial is presented by Jiang Fusheng, Brigade Commander of the 3rd Brigade of the National Government Guard Division; Song Shike, Brigade Commander of the Independent Brigade of the 45th Division; Wang Dianjia, Chief Adjutant of the Headquarters of the 3rd Brigade of the National Government Guard Division; Huang Zhenwu, Commander of the 1st Regiment of the Military Police; Li Desheng, Battalion Commander of the 1st Battalion of the 60th Regiment of the 30th Brigade of the 10th Division; Li Jiyun, Battalion Commander of the 1st Battalion of the 59th Regiment of the 30th Brigade of the 10th Division; Liu Ying, Battalion Commander of the 3rd Battalion of the 59th Regiment of the 30th Brigade of the 10th Division; Liu Bingzhe, Battalion Commander of the 2nd Battalion of the 56th Regiment of the 28th Brigade of the 10th Division; Luo Fanggui, Battalion Commander of the 3rd Battalion of the 56th Regiment of the 28th Brigade of the 10th Division; Xiao Jun, Battalion Commander of the 1st Battalion of the 52nd Regiment of the former 18th Division; and Li Qiji, Chief of Staff of the 53rd Regiment of the former 18th Division.</p>

<p>Donations Solicited for Construction of Memorial Stele: Since the establishment of Party rule, this county still lacks monuments commemorating the late Premier. The Party Headquarters has repeatedly proposed plans to build a memorial stele but lacks a suitable site. After the demolition of the Yuecheng (outer city wall) at the West City Gate and the opening of the road, the area has become bustling. The Party Headquarters recognized the Yuecheng base as a suitable location for building a memorial stele, and the public also clamored for it. The Construction Bureau has now finalized the plans, but regarding the funding issue, the county government yesterday convened a meeting of various agencies and public organizations in the city to discuss fundraising methods, proposing a total amount of three thousand yuan, which was unanimously approved by the public and distributed for fundraising. If there is any surplus in the future, it will be used to decorate the surroundings of the memorial stele. The Construction Bureau is responsible for the engineering aspects.</p>

Yang Yucai, an investigator from the Public Security Bureau, noticed that the two passengers were wearing brand new clothes and shoes and looked suspicious. Just as he was about to step forward to question them, the two passengers looked flustered and tried to avoid him upon seeing Yang's uniform. Yang and the railway police captured the two men. A Mauser pistol was found around one man's waist, loaded with two bullets, and another twenty bullets were found in his pocket. He confessed his name was Mo Shuxin, from Guangxi, and that he had previously served as a soldier. He had come to Suzhou from Hankou and planned to take the train to Changzhou, etc. The other man, Wei Shiling, confessed similarly. They were both handed over to the Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>

<p>A Family of Four Tragically Crushed to Death: At the Qishuyan Station on the border of Wuxi and Changzhou, around 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, two female passengers, carrying a boy of about five years old, were crossing the tracks to go to the other side. Unfortunately, they encountered the night express train number 28 coming from Nanjing, speeding by like lightning. The two female passengers and the boy were unable to avoid it in time and were all crushed to death. Their flesh and blood were blurred beyond recognition, too gruesome to look at. One of the female passengers was also pregnant, and the fetus also died tragically. It is said that the two female passengers were the legal wife and concubine of a wealthy mahogany furniture maker in Shanghai, and their clothes were luxurious. The handbag contained two hundred yuan in banknotes and silver dollars. They were going to a wedding at a relative's house in Wujin when they were tragically crushed to death. It was truly a disaster.</p>
<p>Soldiers and Bandits Fight at Gaoqiaokou at Night: Gaoqiaokou, outside the North Gate of this county, is located in a remote area with a vast river surface, serving as a vital waterway for traffic between Wuxi and Cheng. A squad of road-guarding soldiers from the 8th Company of the 2nd Battalion of the 1st Regiment of the Military Police is stationed there to maintain order. Unexpectedly, at 11:30 PM the night before last, a suspicious-looking pedestrian was spotted by Wang Yeqing, a sentry of the Military Police. He immediately shouted the password, but the person did not respond and stealthily approached the river beach in silence. The soldier, realizing that he was a bandit, opened fire. Unexpectedly, seven or eight more bandits came from the front and dared to return fire. Upon hearing the alarm, Squad Leader Weng Shijun of the Military Police immediately led the entire squad of Military Police, each armed with a quick-firing rifle, to the bridge and opened fire. The two sides engaged in a fierce battle for several minutes. The bandits were overwhelmed and scattered in all directions. The bandits lurking on the river beach also jumped into the river, intending to escape, but they drowned due to their lack of swimming skills. The Military Police have recovered the bodies. Mao Jinsheng, the head of the 17th Tu (a local administrative unit), reported it to the County Court. Yesterday (the 25th) morning at 8:00 AM, Substitute Prosecutor Zhu Zonghai went to the countryside to conduct an examination for verification.</p>

<p>Anniversary of Huangxu New Village: The Huangxu Town Rural Improvement Experimental Zone in Zhenjiang County was commissioned by the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture and Mines and planned by the China Vocational Education Society. The site is located ten li from the Xinfatun Station on the Jinghu Road, with a main road, accessible directly by rickshaw to the experimental area. Since its opening, it has been one year. Yesterday, a grand anniversary meeting was held to showcase the achievements of various departments. In the morning, the China New Agricultural Implement Promotion Institute demonstrated new agricultural implements, with Yao Huiquan and Zhu Jiao explaining in detail. Farmers expressed satisfaction after visiting, and many placed orders for small engines, millet machines, rice and wheat threshers, etc. Subsequently, teachers and students from the Jiangsu Provincial National Health Institute performed martial arts, which were particularly impressive. In the afternoon, various products and specimens from the Department of Agriculture and Mines, Jinling University, and the Central Model Forestry Area were displayed, all catering to the needs of farmers. At 3:00 PM, a commemorative ceremony was held, attended by Xu Yaoqing, the representative of the Department of Agriculture and Mines; Zhang Jiyun, the County Magistrate of Zhenjiang; Zhang Hongjun, the Director of the Construction Bureau; Chen Ruizhang of the Provincial Education College; Jiang Wenyu and Huang Renzhi of the China Vocational Education Society; Wu Shuzhou of the Lantang Normal School; and all committee members, normal school students, folk school students, and local people from this area, no fewer than three thousand people.

Next, government officials and guests delivered speeches, all admiring the chairman for forsaking high official positions and being willing to engage in grassroots work, which is truly commendable. Combined with the efforts of the committee and staff, the current achievements have been made. It is also rare that the general farmers know how to serve the local area, which is rarely seen elsewhere. They also hope that all farmers will strive to be good people in order to realize a good Huangxu, it was said. Someone proposed that a commoner give a speech. Xiao Hu, who pushes a cart and is now a folk school student, came to the stage and gave a speech thanking the establishment of the folk school, which enabled him to read and write, bringing convenience everywhere, and listed several points of the Improvement Association's welfare for the people, which received great applause from the audience.

<h3 id="e74">Letter from Tong Ji Da Luo Xin, Harbin, stationed in Shanghai <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>To the Editor-in-Chief of Shen Bao,</p>
<p>Greetings. We recently read in your newspaper, on the second page, a special dispatch about the depression in Harbin, stating that the large department store Tong Ji Da Luo Xin has lost all of its capital of 400,000 taels and was about to close on the 23rd. Various sectors, considering its significant impact on the market, have agreed to provide assistance and requested creditors to waive interest for one year. We were quite surprised upon reading this. After investigation, our store's business for the whole year is still quite considerable. The matter of losses is completely untrue. Moreover, the exact amount of our store's capital is not 400,000 taels. Your newspaper's publication is clearly based on inaccurate information. Should such rumors continue to be spread, it will inevitably affect our store's reputation. We hereby request a correction. We extend our regards.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Tong Ji Da Luo Xin, Harbin, stationed in Shanghai</p>

<p>(B) Sun Tehui Summarizes Human Life Activities into Four Aspects:</p>
<p>(I) Economics, (II) Health, (III) Sociability, (IV) Aesthetics.</p>
<p>This method of summarization, in the era of childhood, the economic activity, is not of much relevance. It can simply be said that children themselves do not understand economics at all. Moreover, names like Sociability and Aesthetics, crowned on the activities of children, are not easily understood by children themselves.</p>
<p>(C) Ban Saier also summarizes human life activities into four aspects, but completely different from Sun's. His summarization method is as follows:</p>
<p>(I) Civic Activities, (II) Health Activities, (III) Vocational Activities, (IV) Leisure Activities.</p>
<p>Ban's summarization is the most appropriate, and it is very suitable for that kind of analysis method in children's lives. However, the vocational activity, in the entire life of children, will not have direct vocational activities. At the same time, in order to make children understand the meaning of studying for the sake of studying, the entire life activities of children are summarized into four aspects as follows:</p>
<p>(I) Civic Activities, (II) Academic Activities, (III) Health Activities, (IV) Leisure Activities.</p>
<p>(IV) The Goal of Life Guidance. Under the overall child life guidance, there cannot be a specific goal. Even if there is, it is only a hypothetical goal. Moreover, we hope that children can discover some social goals in their own lives.</p>
<p>Now, we have set the following four activity goals based on the four types of activities disassembled from the above four types of human life:</p>
<p>A. Disciplinary Activities, B. Scientific Thinking, C. Healthy Physique, D. Artistic Interests.</p>
<p>In short, disciplinary activities are the goal of civic activities, scientific thinking is the goal of academic activities, a healthy physique is the goal of health activities, and artistic interests are the goal of leisure activities.</p>
<p>These four goals were discovered in the activities after we implemented child life guidance for a year and felt they were needed.</p>
<p>(V) Methods of Life Guidance. Moral education and the mutated child self-government of moral education place emphasis on "moral." The initiator of this method is the teacher, is the school, not the children themselves. The focus of life guidance is on "life." This life is definitely not the life of the teacher, nor does this life belong to anyone. This life is attached to the children themselves. From this point of view, moral education is heteronomous, life guidance is autonomous, moral education is dead, life guidance is lively.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in terms of the position taken by the guidance, life guidance does not stand in front of, behind, or beside the children's activities, doing the work of leadership, command, and supervision. Child life guidance must deeply join in the middle of children's activities, closely providing guidance to the activities at all times. The highest point of activity guidance is to make the children forget that they are children, and the teachers also forget that they are teachers. This is the ultimate goal of child life guidance.</p>
<p>(IV) Last Few Words</p>
<p>In this research question, we have criticized the past child self-government, and also stated the theoretical basis of life guidance. As for the practice of life guidance, due to time constraints, we cannot report in detail. We are very sorry. However, if you want to explore the actual situation, please read the theory and practice of child life guidance published by our school.</p>

<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Women's Sericulture Training Institute has been operating for fifteen years since its establishment. Its management has always been perfect, and its achievements have been remarkable. Students from various counties come to the institute with books on their backs, and those who come to seek knowledge are quite enthusiastic. Recently, due to the implementation of austerity policies by the Construction Department, it is planned to merge the institute with the training department of the Improvement Farm and move it to the buildings vacated by the Improvement Farm as a school site. It will then be renamed Zhejiang Provincial Sericulture Improvement Farm, with an affiliated Sericulture Training Department. The students at the institute all believe that the long-established mother school with considerable achievements will be virtually eliminated, which will greatly hinder their academic future. They have proposed to petition the competent authorities to maintain its name and value women's education, while still not hindering austerity policies and academics. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the student union elected representatives to submit a petition to the Construction Department, which was received by a certain secretary who promised to find a way to resolve it.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Jiangsu Education Department Orders Commendation of Yangzhou Middle School <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Jiangsu Education Department issued an order to Yangzhou Middle School, stating: "Based on the report on the teaching situation of the school by Section Chief Xiang Linxuan of the First Section of this Department and Secretary Hou Hongjian, it is briefly stated that Shao Xuan and others were assigned to inspect the Provincial Middle School Normal Department Achievement Exhibition in December of last year. They took the opportunity to inspect the teaching situation of Yangzhou Middle School. They inspected the classes of all levels of the junior high school department for two days and the equipment management within the school. They inspected the classes of all levels of the senior high school department for three days. On that day, due to the closing of the exhibition, the classrooms had not been cleaned up, so several classrooms were unable to hold classes. Also, due to the meeting for the national language research of the normal schools, there were two classrooms where the national language teachers were unable to teach. All dormitory dining rooms, libraries, instrument rooms, and other rooms, as well as the management of the school, were guided and explained by Principal Zhou Hou-shu. The general situation of the two-day inspection is described as follows:</p>
<p>(1) General situation of the junior high school department inspection ㈠ The classrooms are still tidy and solemn. ㈡</p>
<p>The dormitories are also clean and orderly. ㈢ The library and instruments are shared by both the senior and junior high school departments, so the equipment in the second courtyard is insufficient. ㈣ Director Lu of the junior high school department is earnest in his work, so the students in the second courtyard can still work hard in various courses.</p>
<p>(2) General situation of the senior high school department inspection ㈠ In the classrooms, the students are still paying attention to the lectures, and the teachers are mostly able to supplement various application materials outside of the lecture notes and textbooks. ㈡ The dormitories are also well-organized. ㈢ The various facilities in the library and the physics and chemistry equipment room are due to the good foundation of the former normal school, and Principal Zhou's special attention to science, so many new instruments have been purchased. In summary, the equipment is quite impressive. ㈣ Yangzhou Middle School stipulates that physics, chemistry, and biology are compulsory subjects for senior high school students. The equipment in the laboratories for these three subjects can all be used. For the student experiment grade boxes, after the students complete the experiments, they put the results in the boxes. The teachers take them out, read and correct them, and then record the scores as the experiment grades. The method is quite appropriate. ㈤ In terms of moral education, a counter is set up in the moral education director's office, and the moral education rules are listed on the counter. The methods of punishment and reward are handled in accordance with the regulations. In the dormitory, there is a student nameplate outside each room. Each week, the dormitory staff records the student's conduct score and hangs it outside the door. If these methods are fully and thoroughly implemented, the effectiveness will be very great.</p>
<p>In summary, this inspection, due to time constraints, was biased towards the exhibition of achievements, so the content of the school has not been examined in detail. It seems that a second inspection can be made next year to be more detailed. Here is a report of all the inspection situation in Yangzhou, I hope you will review it," etc. Based on this, it is found that the school's various teaching and moral education items, and the school's internal equipment, are still appropriate, and should continue the past achievements, and seek future development. Now, based on the foregoing, the principal should be notified of this order."</p>

<p>Mr. Shu Shubei, a native of Changsha, is the second son of Shu Chusheng, the former director of the Pingxiang Mining Bureau. After graduating from Tsinghua University, he was sent to study veterinary medicine in the United States. He received a master's degree from Cornell University and then entered the University of Michigan to study various epidemics and prevention, etc., and obtained a doctorate. He then went to Europe to inspect veterinary hospitals and agricultural horse farms in various countries before returning to his homeland a few days ago. Recent Photo of Dr. Shu Shubei</p>
<p>Various groups have been inviting him to give lectures in recent days. It is said that there are many doctors for humans in our country, but too few doctors for animals. Moreover, China is based on agriculture. Directly speaking, production cannot be developed without the development of livestock. More production will inevitably lead to national wealth. Indirectly speaking, the meat of poultry and livestock accounts for 4% of the food of the people of the whole country. Few people know that there are several kinds of bacteria in the meat of poultry and livestock that can be transmitted to humans. Therefore, people often do not know the source of their illness.</p>

<h3 id="e87">Northeast Wins Five Out of Five <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Fifty to Eighteen Victory Over China Public School</p>
<p>Tomorrow Night at 7 PM Battle Against East China Team</p>
<p>The Northeast University basketball team, last night, employed exquisite skills and ingenious tactics to defeat China Public School at the China Basketball Arena, marking the team's fifth consecutive victory since arriving in Shanghai. The final score was 50 to 18, with Northeast leading 26 to 11 in the first half. The referee was Shu Hong. Tomorrow night at 7 PM, they will clash with the East China team at the same venue.</p>
<p>Uneven Strength at the Start</p>
<p>The central player taps the ball, passes it two or three times, and Liao Lie from China Public School shoots from afar. With a "thwack" sound, the whistle blows, and points are added to China Public School's score, a swift and indescribable start. China Public School, initially successful, rallies the entire team, focusing solely on offense while neglecting internal defense. Northeast seizes the opportunity to attack, with Ma, Fan, and Tian scoring, taking a 5 to 2 lead. China Public School switches to a hired-passing strategy, penetrating the enemy's formation, and He Yanzhang achieves his goal. At this point, both sides engage in a close-quarters battle, with no clear advantage. Northeast's Fan Tingrui makes a turnaround shot, and China Public School's Chen Shiqiu scores with a jump shot. Point for point, they shadow each other. Chen Baoqiu gets a free throw opportunity, which could have tied the score at 8-8, but his strength fails him, and he misses. From then on, their morale gradually declines, and both offense and defense suffer.</p>
<p>Gradually Revealing True Strength</p>
<p>The five generals from beyond the Great Wall, at this time, reveal their true strength, passing left and right, alternating front and back. The China Public School basket becomes the target, one ball after another, each scoring. Fan and Tian in particular score many points. China Public School repeatedly calls timeouts to strategize, ultimately finding it futile. Most unfortunately, China Public School's captain, Chen Jiaqiu, fouls out, significantly weakening their strength. Despite their efforts, China Public School is unable to gain traction. In the first half, Northeast scores 26 points, and China Public School scores 11.  The final result is a wide disparity.</p>
<p>Decisive Outcome in the End</p>
<p>In the second half, China Public School fights like a cornered beast, engaging in a desperate battle. Initially, they use stillness to control movement, which proves somewhat effective. Wei Zuohan scores three points alone, boosting their momentum. Northeast suffers some losses but remains unfazed, seeing through their plan and seeking new progress. However, Ma Bingjun steals back a ball, Yuan Tingrui scores on a solo effort, and Pang Ying breaks through the basket three times, achieving a favorable situation. China Public School loses its bearings and willingly admits defeat. As a result, Northeast defeats China Public School by a score of 50 to 18.</p>

<p>Mother, today's lecture was simply wonderful. The speaker was a dignified old gentleman who advised people to be honest in their conduct, dealings with others, and interactions, using various metaphors that I will never forget.</p>
<p>Mother: But you're so late. Did you walk back?</p>
<p>Son: No, I took the tram. Mother, this time I saved twenty-four coppers because the ticket seller was too busy and didn't ask me for the fare, so I got away with it.</p>

<h3 id="e91">The Peculiar and Reformed Female Attire of Panyu County <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Panyu County, Guangdong Province, bordering Hua County, has female attire that differs from Guangzhou as much as Jiangbei differs from Shanghai. The female attire there, with silver hairpins and circles, peach blossom chains, coolie hats, headscarves, and hand bracelets, flat-buttoned flower shoes, floral belts, aprons, etc., is oddly shaped. The three-pronged tassel and bone-plated flower basket knife-style earrings are especially ugly and in extremely poor taste. Chen Yue, the magistrate of Panyu County, deeply felt that these vulgar customs posed many obstacles to the future of culture and education. He specially convened a meeting of local gentry at the Lian Sheng Community Township Office in Taihe Market, Fifth District, and resolved to issue an order to implement reforms to reverse this declining trend. The new attire was drafted by the Dongping Community Township Office and promulgated by the county magistrate. The regulations for implementation are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Hairstyle: If one can voluntarily cut their hair, that would be fashionable. If not, they may keep it. However, the silver hair circles and hairpins previously used must be abolished. Now, replace it with the round bun (commonly known as the salty pancake bun). The materials used should only be for the bun. Whether the bun clasp is made of silver or copper is up to the individual. (2) Earrings: The previously used flower basket or bone-plate styles must be abolished. Now, replace them with ear hoops and other styles commonly used in Guangzhou. It is up to the individual to decide. (3) Aprons may still be used temporarily, but floral belts should be abolished. Replace them with white or red belts. (4) Headscarves should be abolished. Replace them with various hats or headbands commonly used by women in Guangzhou. It is up to the individual to decide. (5) Clothing: All blue cloth shirts with cuffed sleeves, tassel balls, and stiff, upright collars must be abolished. As for the length, width, tightness, it is up to the individual to decide. (6) All coolie hats, flower shoes, floral belts, and long-handled sunshades must be abolished. Replace them with various bamboo rain hats and various rain umbrellas commonly used in Guangzhou, as well as various cloth shoes, to enhance the appearance. (7) All flat buttons (i.e., pendant buttons), peach blossom chains, and other poor ornaments worn by women when they newly marry must be abolished in order to eliminate vulgar customs, etc. This is also a new regulation for reforming women's attire during the period of political tutelage. It is specially recorded.</p>

<p>Wu Zhihui, an important figure in the National Government, is known for his humorous speech and bold actions. He and Yu Youren are referred to as the "Two Elders." Wu recently wrote in the vernacular style. When the Wuxi painter Wu Guandai passed away, he personally returned to Wuxi from Shanghai to offer condolences and composed a lengthy couplet of dozens of words, which was written on high-quality silk and hung in front of the spirit tablet. The people of Wuxi competed to circulate it. The couplet reads: What kind of flock of swans are these microbes, that actually dragged my brother's old life away? Idly dreaming of a worn-out brush, believing it will be passed down to future generations, only to write about Gu Hutou and Ni Yunlin, merely adding chapters to the Wuxi art history, for us all to laugh and talk about, and ultimately be done with. How hateful, the fleeting time and short life, difficult to retain the grand gathering of talented people. Heartbroken, the seven-foot Paulownia coffin, closing and burying love, only remaining are Sun Laihe and Lian Tanzhe, returning all to the stone house in Beiping, together experiencing rise and fall, as mourners from all directions sadly and earnestly recount the past.

<p>Naoiko Masaki, the principal of Tokyo Art School, the painter Watanabe Kason, and the accompanying staff Iijima Masao, Masaki Atsumi, Inoue Noriko, Wang Yachen, and others, came to Hangzhou from Shanghai by special express train on the 19th to solicit works for the Yuan, Ming, and Qing Dynasty paintings exhibition to be held this spring in Tokyo and Osaka, as well as for the Sino-Japanese joint modern painting exhibition to be held at the same time. They stayed at the West Lake Hotel and immediately visited the Japanese consul and the National West Lake Art College. They also toured the Xiling Seal Art Society. On the way back, they indulged in wine at the Xiyuelai Restaurant, enjoying various fish and seafood. The West Lake vinegar fish is renowned throughout the world, and the soft-shelled turtle is a particular favorite of the Japanese, who especially appreciated it. They all said that the reason why there are more than 360 Chinese restaurants in one corner of Tokyo is understandable from this experience. On the morning of the 20th, they visited Mayor Chen Qihuai, hoping to get his guidance and to enjoy the hospitality of the host. However, he was in a meeting, so they were only received by the secretary's office. They hurriedly left and visited Yuan Xunchu but also missed him. Since it was close to noon, they went straight to the welcome banquet hosted by the Japanese Consul Minaiyama Yongfu. Prominent figures from the art world, such as Yu Yueyuan, Zhang XuanChu, Zheng Xiangquan, Shang Yehou, Wu Jiesai, Yu Xueyang, Yang Xuejiu, Yuan Weichen, Narita Torajiro, Tsutsumi Rokuzaburo, and more than twenty others were invited to accompany them, creating a lively and grand gathering. In the afternoon, they visited Ma Yichu and had the opportunity to see many newly unearthed Han and Tang antiquities and Song Dynasty murals, which they admired greatly. That evening, Yu Xueyang and Yang Xuejiu hosted a dinner at Jufeng Garden. During the meal, they discussed rare woodblock prints and learned that Ma had many ancient Song and Yuan editions. They agreed that Ma would bring them for viewing at a vegetarian meal at Longjing Temple at noon that day. After the banquet, they visited Zhang XuanChu at Xuanlu. As it was late, they exchanged brief greetings and departed. The 21st was the scheduled day for touring the mountains. Because of the lunch appointment at Longjing Temple, they set out early in the morning. The gardens along the way were mostly secluded and charming. Among them, the Hongli Mountain Villa of the Gao family was the most evocative of Yuan Zicai's description of being vast and profound. The Gao Villa was rebuilt from the ruins of a Yuan Dynasty residence, so the trees and ancient banks were magnificent. The intertwined red oaks were even more rare. The oak was originally scrap material, but because of the intertwined branches, it has been able to survive for more than four hundred years without decaying. The mountain villa also got its name from this. Fortunately. They paused briefly at the tomb of Yu Qian, focusing on the stone carvings. Arriving at Longjing, it was already past noon. They studied the famous products of Longjing in detail. Then, the so-called flag gun is the symbol of Longjing, and the five-tipped shape produced by Lion Peak, as well as Yunqi and Hupao, each have their own characteristics. Only then did they suddenly realize the meaning of the formerly referred to Lion Dragon Cloud Tiger. They then advanced towards Lingyin. They walked to the Ligong Stele and examined the cliff carvings. They took photographs of the complete ones to transmit them. After passing through Feilai Peak's A Line of Sky, they arrived at Lingjiu Temple. They missed meeting Master Yuming, so they took the route through Yuquan and Yue's Tomb to the West Lake Art College's public banquet at the New New Hotel. They also heard that there would be farewell banquets hosted by Yu Yueyuan, Yuan Xunchu, Zhang XuanChu, Wang Xiangquan, and Gao Yehou, Wu Zengbao on the 22nd. At that time, the masterpieces of various collectors will also be displayed for viewing.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Song and Dance and Violets <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Chen Yan</p>
<p>Recently, the performing arts industry has entered a period of revival. The Plum Blossom Society has already been held at the Odeon and then at the City Hall, and will be performed again at the Central Grand Theatre starting on the 31st. (In addition to "Seven Emotions," there will also be the anti-war grand song and dance drama "The Person Not Seen Last Year," which is said to make the audience feel as if they are in the middle of a battlefield.) And Ms. Violet, who is famous in South China, will also perform at the Odeon on the 25th. Those in Shanghai who are fans of song and dance will be able to fully satisfy their desires.</p>
<p>I was impressed by Ms. Violet's reputation three years ago. At that time, my friend Lin Shi San gave me a few small portraits of Ms. Violet and told me about her quick wit and beautiful art. Since then, Ms. Violet's name has always been in my thoughts. Later, I heard news of her coming to Shanghai, so I visited Feng Ziyou and got a complete history of her, which I published in a small newspaper. Unexpectedly, I had to leave Shanghai for some business. When I returned, Ms. Violet's performance was already over. I couldn't help but regret it.</p>
<p>Now, Ms. Violet and her mother, Madam Ma, and Director Chen Yuesheng, are revisiting Shanghai. I also returned to Shanghai for business. I am now grateful that the previous opportunity was missed, and this opportunity has turned out well. I visited her residence on Jiaozhou Road with my friend Wang Rujia. In the room, we met with Pan Jiarui, the manager of Victory Records, and we had a pleasant conversation. Yesterday, at the first performance, I was able to listen to a clear song and watch a wonderful dance at the Odeon. "Loudong Complaint" is the most elegant of the Cantonese songs. The ancient words and the sad melody, combined with Ms. Violet's pearl-like voice, made people praise her endlessly. In the comedy "Half a Chicken," Ms. Violet appeared in men's clothing, looking just like a handsome young man. Her performance and singing were extremely funny. The "Taigo" dance by Feng Ziyou's eldest son was graceful and rhythmic. The audience was large, which was to be expected. I sat next to the dancer Qian Zhongxiu, who said that even though she didn't understand Cantonese, she was impressed by Ms. Violet's voice and expressions. I heard that today's program includes a performance of "Mulan Joining the Army," and the costumes are something that is hard for people to replicate. The excellence of the sword dance is something extra. I will still make a second visit with Mr. Pan and Mr. Wang.</p>
<p>The New Family Magazine Inaugural Issue Published by Da Dong Book Company, with Shou Juan as the Main Contributor, the inaugural issue of New Family magazine was published yesterday. The book is a large format of 18 open pages, printed entirely in No. 4 font. The opening page has a three-color version of "Violet Village," which was created by Mrs. Zhou Yanghao, the wife of Mr. Cai Yuanpei, while she was in Hamburg, Germany. The other copper-zinc plate illustrations number 21. The text includes works by Tian Xu, Wo Sheng, Pan Wenan, Cheng Xiaoqing, 丅 Hui Kang, Zhang Henshui, and Xu Zhuodai. The latest bizarre case of Arsene Lupin, "The Blue-Eyed Girl," is also published in this magazine. The entire book is about 300 pages and is sold separately for six jiao. Because the prize for the cream-colored room furniture in the first draw has not yet been determined, the lottery is still being sold. The first special prize number of the Wan Guo Savings Association for the following month is scheduled to be the winning number. The annual subscription is only four yuan, postage included.</p>

<p>Six Months Spent in Paris</p>
<p>To create the Donogocco City as Professor Trohart had babbled, capital was needed first. Man Dan initially started with sports bankers. After many twists and turns, he finally obtained the help of a financier who wanted to get rich. He organized a Franco-American company with the aim of improving and expanding Donogocco City and developing its surrounding areas. The propaganda machine was successful in attracting many people to sign up to join. The name Donogocco aroused the dreams of people all over the world. Many speculators from various countries formed groups to go to this mysterious place to make a fortune. The first batch followed the path that Trohart had claimed and walked for weeks in the tropical mountains without finding anything. Later, they were really tired, so they stopped in one place, set up camp, and settled down. This was the beginning of Donogocco City. Later, the second and third batches of people running to get rich kept coming. The population grew day by day, and the real houses were being built more and more every day. Professor Trohart's ranting had become a reality. Ra Mangdan, who had previously despaired and wanted to commit suicide, was now the governor of Donogocco City. And the ridiculous Professor Trohart was safely made a member of the National Academy. And his bronze statue will permanently stand in that newly built city.</p>
<p>We can tell just by looking at this plot that this script cannot be performed on an ordinary stage. The Piga Theater has done its best to perform "Donogocco" this time. To be honest, some places are worth our astonishment. But no matter what, we always feel that this play is a film play rather than a stage play. It is really far less economical and natural to perform it on stage for four hours than to project it on the screen for one hour. From this point of view, although we cannot say that stage plays will be eliminated by movies in the future, at least this kind of large-scene setting drama will no longer belong to the realm of stage plays in the future, that can be asserted. As for the thoughts contained in the play "Donogocco" and its literary value, that is naturally another question, worthy of our careful consideration.</p>

<p>Chapter 17: The Art of Maintaining Youthful Looks, Dark Eyebrows Mistaken for Moths; No Way to Extend Life, the Golden Market's Rapid Horses</p>
<p>Long Ziyun asked, "What kind of people are called 'Second Devils'?" Old Lin Daiyu said, "The meaning of 'Second Devils' is those who help foreigners. They come from the mouths of the upper classes, called 'Han traitors.' In the Northern dialects, they are called 'Second Devils.' Generally, 'Big Devils' are foreigners. They see many people working in Tianjin foreign companies and entering and exiting the Beijing Dongjiaomin Lane, and they all call them 'Second Devils.' Later, it was no longer limited. Anyone wearing clothes that looked a bit foreign was also called a 'Second Devil.' A relative of mine, a telegraph student in Tianjin, was wearing a pair of foreign socks when he happened to encounter the Boxers. They arrested him and said he was a 'Second Devil.' They almost cut off his feet. Fortunately, there was an acquaintance in the Boxer group who pleaded for him, and they didn't cut off his feet. But they still wanted to drag him to the altar of the ancestral master to submit a memorial. Fortunately, the memorial was also submitted, and the boy's life was saved." Zuo Shichen said, "To judge a crime based on the ancestral master is a barbaric system. In fact, their killings depended on the weather that day." Long Ziyun asked anxiously, "What is the significance of that?" Zuo Shichen said, "I also heard people say that their submission of memorials is closely related to the weather. If the weather today is clear and bright, the so-called atmospheric pressure is not low, then the memorial will be raised and fly into the air, and this person will have a chance to live. If the weather today is bad, or if it is damp, then the memorial will not be raised. This determines that he is a 'Second Devil.' Even the ancestral master won't help them, then his life should be like this. Secondly, I heard that the people submitting the memorials also have some tricks. Their so-called memorial is made of yellow paper. When submitting the memorial, they use large handfuls of burning incense sticks, and the fire is strong in the wind. They hold the roll of yellow paper high in their hands and chant words in their mouths. When the memorial is burning, some tricks must be used. Following the wind, they send it upwards. Otherwise, if your hand is motionless, and the weather is bad, the paper ash will not rise. So the hand of the person submitting the memorial can indeed control the power of life and death." Old Lin Daiyu, after listening to Zuo Shichen's words, seemed to strongly disagree and said, "You can't say there is no reason at all. The people whose memorials could not be raised were all helping foreigners after investigation. Otherwise, how could those princes and lords in Beijing, who are all learned and reasonable people, believe them?" Zuo Shichen said, "It was those learned and reasonable people who ruined things. They advocated what they called national essence martial arts, what fist and what fist, it was unclear. As a result, the Boxer Rebellion broke out. Using this kind of thing to temper the body, to pass the time, counting it as a kind of gymnastics, it would have been fine. If they had boasted about it, it would have turned out like this."</p>

<h3 id="e97">Financial Matters: Fluctuating Gold Prices Last Week <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Under the Influence of Sino-American Loan Control</p>
<p>The rate of rise and fall was extremely strong. The gold market situation last week still exhibited powerful fluctuations. A sudden rise or fall of ten taels was not unusual, and daily differences exceeded twenty taels. Lack of coordination among dealers made it exceedingly difficult to handle, as the momentum of the turbulent waves was unstoppable, ultimately trending downwards. This was actually due to rumors of a large-scale U.S. loan to China brewing, with conflicting information causing widespread panic. Most major speculators and bulls had already sold off their holdings, unwilling to hold them for long. From the beginning of the week, the market showed signs of weakening, followed by extreme confusion, with violent advances and retreats, marked by great instability. However, the highest price on Tuesday reached 741 taels. By the next day, the bubble burst, breaking through the 700 tael mark, plummeting to 698 taels. By the end of the week (Saturday), the situation seemed to stabilize, closing at 715.5 taels, still down 11 taels compared to the previous week. The week saw a total fluctuation of 43 taels. As for the overseas silver market, it tended to rise, but remained in a state of flux. Near-term British silver rose by 5.625, and long-term by 3.75. The U.S. silver price rose by 1.25, and the shilling exchange rate rose by one level. The Japanese exchange rate fell by 0.3. However, the domestic interbank market remained stable, due to the government and foreign merchants settling import payments, hence the Shanghai market seemed to diverge. In terms of the exchange rate, the gold price should not have fallen excessively, but with the Sino-American loan issue, there are concerns that the future may hold further changes. It is observed that the cash reserves of various gold firms are excessive, leading some dealers to expect gold prices to fall. The bidding for low-grade gold only saw incremental increases of a few cash units. The number of contracts traded on the exchange only totaled over 20,000. The general situation of the past six days is recorded below.</p>
<p>Concise Review: Starting from Monday, the premium for large bars of silver increased again by .25 to 1.875, the silver price increased by .5. However, the gold price for March futures trended towards a high, opening at 730 taels, a rise of 3.5 taels. This was due to the exchange authorities banning over-the-counter trading, causing prices to rise beforehand. Consequently, the rise in large bar premiums did not have much impact. In addition, the Dalian Gang, Zhifeng Yong, and others bought, followed by 31.5, then sellers quickly gained the upper hand. The exchange rate eased, causing a sudden drop of over 18 taels, settling at only 13 taels. With active buying, despite the shilling rate rising by one level, the domestic market diverged, clearly rising but subtly holding back, resulting in a sharp increase of over 10 taels, surpassing 30 taels, reaching 36 taels. The closing price was 32.5 taels, up 7 taels compared to the previous Saturday. The day saw a total fluctuation of 23 taels, with speculator Mr. Wu making purchases. The next day, the premium for large bars of silver rebounded by 1.25 to 1.875, the silver price decreased by only 0.125, the shilling rate contracted by half a level, but the domestic market eased, the opposite of the previous day. Dealers initially bought high and then sold off. However, it was observed that the Dalian Gang and various firms held long positions in the Japanese exchange rate, totaling over 10 million yuan. The gold market initially fell slightly, but soon major players aggressively bought, causing a sharp rise of 10 taels, quickly reaching 41 taels. However, sellers took advantage of this to sell off, causing an immediate drop of 7-8 taels. Subsequently, rises and falls were erratic, with the afternoon trend heading downwards, breaking through the 30 tael mark. In the end, it settled at only 19.5 taels, closing at 22 taels, a drop of 11.5 taels. The day saw a total difference of 21.5 taels, mainly due to the influence of the Sino-American loan. On Wednesday, the premium for large bars of silver rebounded by 1.25, the silver price increased by 0.25, and the British, American, and Japanese exchange rates all eased overtly and covertly. The exchange rate had already risen by half a level. As for the gold price, it initially fell by 5.5 taels, to 716.5 taels, then to 10.05, as major players sold off. Chenfeng Yong, Zhifeng Yong, and Mitsui and others bought, causing a sharp rise of 10 taels, then surpassing 20 taels. Afterwards, Hengxing, Yuanxing, Yongyongheng, and others sold off, and the exchange rate also eased. It even broke through 710 taels. In the afternoon, the Indian exchange rate reported gains, and major players were especially active. A sudden storm broke through the 700 tael mark. Around 3 o'clock, it suddenly fell to 698 taels, mainly due to conflicting rumors about the Sino-American loan, causing widespread panic. Subsequently, it sharply rebounded by over 10 taels, closing at 710.05 taels, a further decrease of 11.5 taels compared to the previous day. There were 22 taels of rises and falls throughout the day. The market situation remained extremely chaotic. The next day, the premium for large bars of silver rebounded again, rising by 3.75, the silver price increased by 0.875. However, the shilling rate was released by half a notch, and the domestic market tended towards favourable, so the gold market went from weak to firm. With turbulent waves, there were 21 taels of fluctuations. It initially fell by 5 taels, to 705.5 taels, and the morning market saw significant fluctuations. It then rebounded from 710 taels to 701 taels. Afterwards, buyers were diligent and gradually presented a peak, sharply rising by over 10 taels, and further rising in the afternoon, exceeding 20 taels, closing at 22 taels, a rebound of 11.5 taels compared to the previous day. On Friday, the premium for large bars of silver rebounded slightly by 0.0625 to 0.125, the silver price contracted by 0.0625. The U.S. continued to sell, so the gold price initially rose slightly by 0.05, opening at 22.5 taels, then to 25.5 taels. Suddenly, major players came to sell, causing a sharp drop of over 10 taels. The shilling rate initially remained unchanged, but was later reduced by half a notch at noon. The domestic market also strengthened, and buying momentum suddenly became strong, rebounding by over 10 taels, reaching over 28 taels. In the afternoon, it had reached 34.5. However, with conflicting news about the Sino-American loan circulating, the market atmosphere was poor, leading to a drastic fall, plummeting nearly 20 taels, before closing at 11.5 taels. The day saw a total fluctuation of 19 taels, a decrease of 10.5 taels compared to the previous day. The announced price was squeezed to 67-8 taels. On the weekend, the silver market rose slightly, and although the exchange rate had been released by half a notch, the domestic market remained stable, due to settlement payments. The gold market initially saw a fall in the morning, as buyers were active, and the premium for large bars was expected to fall the previous day, but instead rose. Investor sentiment was leaning downwards. Subsequently, there were significant rises and falls, with 7-8 taels of fluctuations. It once fell to 704.5 taels. Later, the exchange rate strengthened, and the banks' appetite was still good, calmly raising prices by 10 taels. During the period, rises and falls were unpredictable. In the afternoon, Hengxing and others bought, causing a surge to 716 taels, closing at 15 taels. The half-day saw a difference of 11.5 taels. The high and low prices of British, American, and Indian silver markets, as well as exchange rates for gold, are listed below.</p>

<p>Bond Prices Rose Slightly Last Week</p>
<p>The market was calm, with 34.8 million in transactions</p>
<p>Last week's situation in the local securities market regarding spot transactions of various bond futures. The futures market saw no slight turnaround in the first half of the week. The market was extremely desolate, and buyers and sellers were very idle. In the second half of the week, the market began to feel slightly more lively. The total number of transactions in the previous week was 34.84 million yuan, a decrease of over 2.8 million yuan compared to the previous week. The 19 bonds saw the most transactions, with 4.2 million for the January term and 3.9 million for the February term. Disbandment bonds saw 3.18 million for the January term and 4.675 million for the February term. The 19 Charity bonds saw 3.84 million for the January term and 3.595 million for the February term.

The market prices of various bonds were very calm. Daily trading throughout the week was very stable, and even slight rises and falls were very small. The bond market environment saw no changes, and major players remained in a wait-and-see attitude, with small movements, so supply and demand were very balanced, and bond prices were also very stagnant.

Afterwards, scattered needs were better, so they fluctuated and rose slightly. Reorganization bonds rose by nearly 2 yuan, and the 19 Customs bonds also rose by one yuan and several jiao. Others were only better by half a yuan or so. It is observed that the bond market situation is unlikely to see major rises and falls for the time being.

<p>Yarn Prices Rose Sharply Last Week</p>
<p>Merchants and brokers handled 6,660 bales of raw yarn</p>
<p>The yarn market was extremely strong last week, with the rising trend unstoppable. This was due to the sharp contraction of exchange rates, leading to high prices for imported goods and rising prices for all commodities. The silver value of third-grade yarn reached over 200 taels, and local factories purchased about 80,000 to 90,000 bales in preparation for the new factory tax. The stock of goods in Shanghai factories was greatly reduced, so the market became more solid. General outsiders tended to take long positions, but most retail investors took short positions. The market atmosphere briefly stabilized in the middle of the week. Later, the Jinzi Gang and two major manufacturers aggressively bought in the futures market, about 8,000 to 9,000 bales per day, making the market even drier. Sellers were scarce, and at the same time, actual sales gradually became active, so sellers suddenly became unstable. Therefore, the Chaozhou Gang, with the strongest short-selling sentiment, saw the overall situation as unfavorable and reluctantly covered their positions on a large scale, with extremely violent price increases. Judging from the overall situation of the yarn market, if current demand is smooth, there is still a rising trend in the future. Major players must watch the 165 tael price of far-month yarn. Yarn prices for each month rose by 4.5 taels compared to the previous week. The total number of transactions for the whole week was 263,400 bales. Merchant gangs bought 5,960 bales of raw yarn, and fellow traders bought 700 bales, with prices rising by 2, 3, and 4 taels. Raw yarn sales were not strong due to the approaching settlement period. Various factories slightly increased production. The number of bales bought by each gang is recorded below.</p>

<p>Factories purchased 25,154 dan of raw cotton. The cotton market was very firm because the source of Hankou cotton was not smooth. Various parties lacked stock, and the exchange rate was difficult to increase, and gold prices rose sharply, resulting in high silver prices for foreign cotton. There was even talk of exporting fire-machine cotton in bundles, fortunately, the quota was small. Therefore, investor sentiment became more agitated, and buyers' attitudes were enthusiastic. Most short-sellers were overwhelmed by the golden tide and could not support it. They had to reluctantly cover their positions, so the market became increasingly tight. Although current raw cotton transactions at various factories were slow, arrivals were not strong. In the middle of the week, the situation of U.S. cotton was slightly better and rose, so investor sentiment was even tighter. The Chaozhou Gang, which had the most selling in the past, saw an unfavorable environment and showed signs of wavering. The price of benchmark cotton rose by 1 tael and 1 qian per month compared to the previous week. The total number of transactions for the whole week was 562,300 dan. The source was 5,500 dan of Yao cotton and 3,700 bales of Tong cotton. Various factories purchased 17,514 dan of raw cotton, and trading firms purchased 7,640 dan. U.S. cotton rose by 30 pounds per pound. The number of bales purchased by manufacturers and trading firms is recorded below.</p>

<p>Yesterday, American cotton fell due to poor news from Liverpool, southern sales, and fewer buyers, with futures falling 14 to 15 pounds. Spot prices fell 15 pounds.

<p>Rice Market Gradually Declining</p>
<p>Yesterday, the source of supplies from Lihu in Zhabei was still around 50. Sales on this street were consistently slow. Chang geng special grade remained stable, which was due to scarce goods and slow trading. Ordinary Zhongguan grade and other geng rice saw sluggish and poor sales, gradually decreasing by a few jiao. Bo dao rice also saw a small decrease of two jiao, with few sales. Yangdu xian rice saw sluggish sales and consistently decreased slightly by nearly a jiao. Biànyuán kè rice also saw a gradual decrease. High-grade goods were hoarded by customers, with extremely limited sales. Medium and low-grade goods saw bleak buying interest, weakening by nearly a jiao. Yinyuan rice was also sluggish, falling by one jiao. It is observed that the supply of high-grade goods has been very dry recently, and all transactions are for ordinary goods.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the source of supplies to Hunan in Shanghai was not much, only around 20. Sales on this street continued to be sluggish. The Northern Gang's Bai geng rice saw a steady decline. Sū-tóng machine geng rice arrivals were relatively slow, and sales remained unsatisfactory, so prices weakened, falling by another jiao. Southern Gang's Bo dao and early rice arrivals slightly decreased yesterday, but demand remained sluggish. Overall, they fell by about a jiao. Yangdu xian rice saw mediocre conditions, and transactions were stagnant, with no price fluctuations. Arrival and sales of Bianyuan rice were balanced. High-grade goods continued to be stable due to scarcity, and medium-grade goods were weak and listless.</p>
<p>Another report from inland communications stated that the current stock in Xidi was still thick, and the stock in Sudi was also high, but the supply of goods for customers was relatively thin. In addition to the sales in Shanghai, Zhejiang customers also inquired slightly. The market trend was also seen as weak, and there may be an increase in the number of deliveries at the end of the year. Therefore, the current sentiment in inland and local markets is consistently mediocre. The future of the rice market is not easy to turn around, which is truly good news for the people's food supply.</p>

<p>The Newly Appointed Director of the Mining Department of the Ministry of Industry</p>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter interviewed Mr. Hu Boyuan, the newly appointed Director of the Mining Department of the Ministry of Industry.

There are countless tasks in construction, and the mining industry is especially important. He will do his best to plan and ensure that the mining industry moves towards a proper path of development. It is reported that Mr. Hu is a native of Wujin, Jiangsu Province. He graduated from the Department of Mining and Metallurgy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United States, and then obtained a degree in Petroleum Engineering from the University of Pittsburgh. He has served as Deputy Engineer at the Indiana Coal Mining Company in the United States, geologist at the Sun Oil Company, metallurgical engineer at the Longyan Iron Mine Smelting Plant after returning to China, and head of the ironmaking department at the Daye Iron Mine.

<h3 id="e112">Record of the Lawyers Association's Spring General Meeting <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Resolutions Passed to Be Handled by the New Executive and Supervisory Committees</p>
<p>Eighteen Executive and Supervisory Committee Members Elected Simultaneously</p>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association convened its spring general meeting yesterday (Sunday) at its clubhouse on Route Bellesterre at the intersection of Avenue Lafayette in the French Concession. The meeting included re-electing executive and supervisory committee members and discussing important proposals. The Shanghai Local Court and the Special District Local Court both sent prosecutors to supervise the meeting. Members attending the meeting included Tan Yigong, Jiang Yiping, Yu Zhongluo, Li Shirui, Yan Yinwu, Qu Yue, Dong Qingyu, Zhan Jifeng, Wu Guotai, Jin Yu, Zhang Feixiong, Tang Yingsong, Chen Zemin, Cai Nipei, Liu Zuwang, Zhang Enhua, Xu Qinpu, Wu Zhiping, Peng Qixiu, Zhao Zuwei, Yao Wenshou, Chao Kun, Wen Chao, Yang Chunlu, Lu Dingkui, Wu Guochang, Fei Tinghuang, Xia Zheshen, Pan Cheng'e, Zhou Xiaoan, Xue Jiaqi, Huang Huanding, Song Shixiang, Chen Ruilin, Fei Guoxi, Wu Mai, Shen Xiaoxiang, Wen Chao, Zhao Yuhuang, Yu Zufen, Bian Jialu, Yang Zhihao, Wang Weizhen, etc., totaling 290 people. The meeting began at 2:30 PM. The following is a record of the meeting proceedings: (1) Opening with a bell; (2) The presidium, consisting of Jiang Yiping, Tan Yigong, and Yu Zhongluo, took their seats; (3) All stood at attention to pay the highest respect to the portrait of the Premier and the national flag; (4) Three minutes of silence; (5) Report on matters: (a) General affairs, (b) Documents, (c) Accounting; (6) Proposals (A) The association's executive and supervisory committees proposed whether the national design of the assembly hall is complete and how to raise the shortfall of funds.

(Note: This proposal resolved to have 11 committee members, fearing that after they are elected as new executive and supervisory committee members, they will not be able to serve as design committee members, hence 11 more were nominated.) (B) Committee members Qu Yue and others proposed that the court announce instructions to change to using service. After proposer Qu Yue, a member, reported on the platform, it was resolved to pass it and hand it over to the new executive and supervisory committee to amend the text and submit it to the judicial authorities for review and handling.

<h3 id="e113">Court Instructions Advocate for Using Service <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>At the Shanghai Lawyers Association General Meeting yesterday, members Qu Yue, Jiang Shiyi, Xu Fuji, Peng Qixiu, Tan Yigong, Qian Baojing, Dong Qingyu, and others proposed the following: To make suggestions, judicial organs were originally established to protect legal interests, so it seems appropriate to seek improvement wherever it is possible to provide convenience to people. Members executing legal affairs feel that there are things that should be improved. According to the court's instructions, the current practice is to use posting. When people make a request, the court handles it by posting the approval. The intention of the court in adopting posting is to avoid the trouble of service, and in addition to notifying the applicant, it also announces it to the general public. In addition, it is copied to newspapers for publication as a public announcement, which cannot be said to be not thorough. However, upon closer examination of the application matters, most are of a relative nature. It is better to serve the notice than to post it. Serving this instruction to the original applicant can be used as evidence in the future, which is beneficial. First, the timing of the approval is mostly not fixed, and the difference in speed often varies greatly. Applicants find it difficult to go to the posting place to view the approval every day, and there are often cases where the approval is posted early, and the applicant repeatedly requests instructions. Changing to service eliminates the trouble of people viewing the approval, which is beneficial. Second, some say that the court's copy to newspapers is sufficient for reference, so why bother with service? It is not known whether the newspapers will publish it. The newspaper has no absolute obligation, and it often stops publishing due to too many manuscripts or occasionally cuts them off. Recently, only the "Min Guo Daily" has published it, and the newspaper's typesetting errors cannot be blamed. Serving the approval eliminates this problem completely, which is beneficial. Third, if the court's original duties are already cumbersome, adding the procedure of service will increase the workload. It is believed that service fees and copying fees can be charged appropriately. Some say that charging these fees will increase the burden on the people. It should be answered that for the sake of convenience, the people will not be stingy with these small service fees and copying fees. It is not appropriate to charge too much for those who live far away. If an attorney is entrusted to act as an agent, the service will be received and forwarded by the attorney. If an attorney is not entrusted, the postage can be prepaid on the day the statement is submitted, and it will be mailed and delivered when the time comes. The people will surely be happy to comply, which is beneficial. Fourth, in short, the posting of documents originally belonged to the era when transportation was inconvenient in ancient times. It was an incomplete method of government offices for the people. Today, courts regard service as the only essential requirement for summons, judgments, and rulings. However, the instructions that have the same interests as judgments and rulings are still posted instead of served, which is a lack of consideration. Members specially suggest this for the sake of improving procedures and facilitating the people. Is it appropriate? The decision is requested. At yesterday's spring general meeting, it was approved and handed over to the new executive and supervisory committee for handling.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Jiangsu Finance Department Urgently Urges Payment of Old Taxes and Busy Canal Fees <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Finance Bureau recently received an order from the Jiangsu Finance Department, instructing it to strictly urge the payment of old taxes and busy canal fees. Therefore, Director Wang issued a notice to the clerks and tax collectors yesterday to comply. The text of the Finance Department's instruction is as follows: For special orders, it is found that the arrears of busy canal fees and reed taxes of various counties in the 16th, 17th, and 18th years are very large. The province has reached several hundred thousand yuan. The provincial government has proposed a meeting to strictly investigate and squeeze out funds to offset the insufficient budget for the second half of this year. A general order has been issued to distinguish between arrears by clerks and arrears by the people. A deadline must be set in the shortest possible time this year, and efforts must be made to collect and clear the payments, report and submit them in batches as special cases. If clerks or others embezzle or resist payment, they will be immediately summoned and pursued. The actual amount of arrears from the 16th, 17th, and 18th years must first be opened and sent to the Finance Department for verification. Now, the aforementioned old arrears have been discussed and decided by the provincial government meeting to be included in the newly added budget income of one million yuan. Since it has been included as regular income in the second half of the year, it is imperative to formulate a method and squeeze out the payments. The bureau should actively proceed, first check and open a list of the accumulated arrears from previous years and send it to the Finance Department by a specific date. At the same time, check and squeeze out the arrears by clerks and arrears by the people separately, and limit the collection of old arrears within six months, at least 50% as a limit. Set a deadline for monthly average payments, and no shortages are allowed. If there are clerks who play tricks and resist orders, propose strict investigations. This is a special order. The bureau directors are expected to follow it carefully.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Textile Society Held a Lecture Yesterday <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Lectures by Members of the British Economic Survey Mission</p>
<p>The Shanghai Textile Society held a textile lecture yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM at the YMCA on Sichuan Road. More than 280 people attended the lecture. Mr. Zhu Gongquan, executive committee member of the society, presided over the meeting and introduced three members of the British Economic Survey Mission, Mr. Weave Tigger Wynn and Mr. Eddie Mumson, to give lectures on the textile industry. Mr. Zhu briefly said that the British Economic Survey Mission's visit to China will definitely help China's textile industry. Britain's textile industry occupies a leading position in the world, and the members of the mission are all textile industry experts. Then, Mr. Weave gave a lecture on the textile industry. The main points of his lecture can be roughly divided into three paragraphs: (1) China is a vast country with abundant resources and is a cotton-producing land. The cotton produced each year can meet most of China's needs. (2) China has a large number of workers who can be hired at any time. (3) China has a vast market. If the government can develop transportation, China's cotton industry will definitely progress. Secondly, he talked about the British textile industry, which is the world's leader, but lacks cotton. Now, the British government and people have jointly organized a cotton planting association to plant a large amount of cotton in various British colonies, which has made the textile industry even more developed. In addition to this, the number of cotton planting talents in the United Kingdom is gradually increasing. If China wants to develop textiles, the United Kingdom can help as much as possible and can also supply textile talents. There are too many workers in China's textile factories, and they need to increase their capabilities. After about 30 minutes of Mr. Weave's speech, Mr. Wynn gave a lecture on the weaving industry. When weaving cloth, there must first be good preparatory work, and after weaving, it must be coated with clean sizing. Mr. Mumson lectured on the finishing of textiles, including bleaching, dyeing, and printing. After the lecture, someone asked about the unemployment problem in the United Kingdom, China's tariff autonomy, what are the thoughts of the United Kingdom, the status of Japanese textile factories, and the situation of the shutdown of 2 million looms in the United Kingdom. The meeting ended at 5 o'clock.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Various Labor Groups in This City Issue a Declaration on Correcting Telecommunications Negotiations <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>"Riri News" reports that more than 40 labor groups in this city issued a declaration yesterday to support the request of telecommunications workers for the correction of the outline of the international telecommunications negotiation agreement. The original text is recorded below:</p>
<p>The target of the National Revolution is imperialists. Its sole mission is to conscientiously abide by the Premier's instructions and strive to abolish unequal treaties. Imperialists have used all means to invade our country. In addition to concessions, tariffs, and legal rights, they also rely on various unequal contracts in telecommunications to manipulate our country's communications and transportation and use them as tools for political, economic, and military aggression. Fortunately, these contracts have all expired, and they should be completely abolished without leaving any room for manoeuvre. Even if the environment forces us to revise new contracts, we should learn from the past and make reciprocity the principle, without allowing any concessions. Recently, representatives of the telecommunications workers' unions in Jiangsu, Hebei, Fujian and other provinces reported that the content of the new agreement signed by the International Telecommunications Negotiation Committee and the representatives of the Great Eastern, Great Northern, and Pacific companies at the end of last year has resulted in excessive losses of rights, such as extending the foreign water line landing period to 14 years. Although the receipt and dispatch of telegrams is nominally returned to self-management, in reality our country only sends one director, who has no real power, and instead pays for the expenses of the receiving and dispatching office. Our country's telegrams to and from Europe and the United States are mostly via Shanghai, but the cost per word of the main line is actually reduced by three sen and a half compared to the old contract. The other items, such as changing the Chinese telegraph bureau's signboard, using the Chinese telegraph bureau's style for incoming and outgoing newspapers and envelopes, and manufacturing the messenger's uniforms by the Ministry of Communications, are all superficial and deceitful. We believe that the various telecommunications contracts are only a relationship between the state and private individuals, and are not comparable to international treaties. Moreover, they have expired, so why is it difficult to abolish them immediately? Now, the new agreement has been revised and compromised to such an extreme extent. Is there any hope for the abolition of other unequal international treaties? This kind of agreement that loses sovereignty is no different from running counter to the party's program, policies, and the purpose of the National Revolution. Can it be the intention of our central government to invigorate and strive to abolish the treaties? For the sake of protecting the party and the country, our association and others express our deep sympathy and support for the telecommunications workers' efforts to seek redress. We are obliged to assist and are willing to lead the workers of Shanghai to fight together, to be unyielding, to be united, and to swear to deal with the foreign telegraph companies to achieve the goal of abolishing the aforementioned agreement and to curb the imperialists' ambition to invade transportation. It must be known that each telecommunications contract is actually our country's contract to sell itself. It is by relying on these water line communication agencies that imperialists can manipulate all our country's commerce, hinder our country's foreign propaganda, and quickly dispatch troops to carry out their policy of military oppression. We hope that our compatriots across the country will rise up together to save national rights and not neglect it as a local problem of telecommunications. This declaration is issued by the Shanghai Postal Workers Union, the Shanghai Press Workers Union, the Commercial Press Workers Union, the Commercial Publishing House Workers Union, the Zhabei Water and Electricity Workers Union, the Shanghai Sauce Industry Workers Union, the Zhaoshang Five Wharf Workers Union, the All Shanghai Wharf Workers Union, the Shanghai-Sichuan Long-Distance Automobile Workers Union, the Shanghai Umbrella Workers Union, the Shanghai Pawnshop Industry Workers Union, the Shanghai Silk and Satin Dyeing Industry Union, the Shanghai Yutong Silk Weaving Workers Union, the Shanghai Pharmaceutical Industry Workers Union, the Guangdong Workers Union Federation in Shanghai, the Shanghai Tea Workers Union, the Su-Ning Tea and Food Workers Union, the Chinese and Foreign Cloth Industry Workers Union, the Chinese Business Water and Electricity Workers Union, the Xiang Sheng Iron Factory Workers Union, the Ship Wood Industry Workers Union, the Qiuxin Shipbuilding Workers Union, the Signboard Industry Workers Union, the Xianghua Silk Weaving Workers Union, the South Shanghai Cleaning Workers Union, the Fresh Pork Stack Ship Workers Union, the Mercerized Dyeing Industry Workers Union, the Newspaper Delivery Workers Union, the Silk Spinning Workers Union, the Guangdong Grocery Workers Union, the Cotton Weaving Industry Pudong District Workers Union, the Guanshengyuan Workers Union, the Foreign Color Dyeing Industry Workers Union, the Blue Dyeing Industry Workers Union, the Shanghai East Silk Factory Workers Union, the Ginseng Industry Workers Union, the British-American Tobacco Factory Workers Union, the Sanyou Society Workers Union, the Sack Workers Union, the Two-Road Catering Workers Union, the Shanghai Hotel Cantonese Overseas Chinese Workers Union, the Shanghai Business Workers Union, the Shanghai Laundry Workers Union, the Shanghai Shanghai Merchant Shipping Staff Workers Union, the Cotton Weaving Workers Union, and the Wood Transportation Workers Union.</p>

<p>The British Economic Survey Mission has completed its investigation of the business and industrial situation in North China and the Yangtze River Basin. It will take the考麻林 steamer to Hong Kong on Tuesday. It will stay in Hong Kong for a few days and then go to Guangzhou to investigate the situation in South China. After the matter is completed, it will return to Hong Kong and is scheduled to depart for home on March 5. It is expected to arrive in the UK around April 10, and report to the government on the findings. According to reports, the mission left the country on September 19 last year and passed through Shanghai for the first time on October 25. It then went to Japan to learn from them before coming to China again for a detailed investigation. It received the support of various government officials and chambers of commerce in various ports, as well as the hospitality of Chinese and foreign people. After returning home this time, it will tell its people the truth about British trade in China and how to develop it. It is estimated that the journey from departure to return will last seven months.</p>

<p>Efforts to Raise Funds</p>
<p>The Asian Literary Society on Museum Road has a long history in Shanghai. It also has a museum and library, which are academic research institutions. Although it was initiated by the British, Chinese and foreign people can join the society, which has an international nature. The buildings were built 60 years ago and are in disrepair. They urgently need to be renovated. A new house plan was drafted several years ago, and a committee was organized to raise funds. However, due to the difficulty in raising huge sums of money, it has been delayed until now. The decay of the buildings is getting worse day by day, and the museum has also temporarily suspended visits to prevent danger. It is now heard that the amount of donations raised has been substantial. In addition to the Municipal Council allocating 50,000 taels and the British government still providing the land free of charge, the amount donated by Chinese and foreign people has reached 25,000 taels. The difference from the estimated construction cost is only about 25,000 taels. Therefore, construction will begin soon in the coming days in order to see it completed as soon as possible. At the same time, efforts will be made to continue raising funds so that the full amount can be reached.</p>

<p>On the 18th of this month, in the Beijing Road area, police officers dispatched by the police station were inspecting pedestrians. A Mr. Zhu Xiaochun was passing by the area and was stopped for inspection. Zhu complied with the inspection. Unexpectedly, a Western police officer pointed a gun at him during the inspection. Later, because Zhu questioned the officer, he was beaten and insulted and detained in the police station overnight. The next day, he was sent to the Special District Court, which declared Zhu Xiaochun innocent. Zhu was very dissatisfied with this incident and yesterday wrote to various party headquarters, organizations, and legal groups about what happened. The Sixth District Party Headquarters, because Zhu was groundlessly insulted by British police officers and intimidated and imprisoned by the police station in the British Concession, sent a telegram to express their opposition. The Second District Party Headquarters also issued a declaration expressing opposition, with very strong words. It is evident that the party headquarters are paying close attention to this matter.</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Ninghu City and County Rice Industry Association held its sixteenth standing committee meeting yesterday at the Cui Xi Hall. The committee members present were Chen Junyu, Zhu Zixiang, Li Zhongchen, Lu Zhuqing, and fourteen others. Zhu Zixiang was publicly elected as chairman. The proceedings were conducted ceremoniously. The chairman reported on the association's re-election matters. Based on the previous session's proposal, letters were sent to the rice industry associations in various counties to solicit members for reorganization. However, since the replies from some counties had not yet arrived, it was impossible to discuss the matter. It could only be postponed to the next session for a vote. The meeting then discussed the proposal from the Nanjing Xiaguan Grain Industry Association and the Wuxi Rice and Bean Industry Association regarding the Anhui Provincial Sailboat Rice Donation Bureau, which, after the abolition of the likin tax, disguisedly collected rice donations, calling it the "Anhui Sailboat Export Rice Inspection Office." The proposal requested the association's assistance to achieve the goal of abolishing the office. It was resolved to report the situation to the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Central Party Headquarters, requesting them to order the abolition of the office. Furthermore, Chen Junyu proposed that the association's previous name was inconsistent with the central government's regulations and should be changed to the "Jiangsu Province Rice and Grain Industry Trade Association Federation." The meeting discussed whether this was appropriate and resolved that the association's name would be corrected after the reorganization. For now, the association would be renamed the "Jiangsu Ninghu City and County Rice Industry Association Federation," and a reorganization preparation committee would be established. Ye Huijun, Chen Junyu, Zhao Zixin, Li Zhongchen, Lu Zhuqing, Li Nianzu, Zhang Jingqi, Pang Bosen, Lu Gongquan, Zhang Weiru, Zhou Hongqing, Yan Xiaoquan, Jiang Yangsheng, Zhang Nianxuan, and Zhu Zixiang were nominated as the fifteen members of the preparation committee.</p>

<p>The Chinese Red Cross Society received a telegram yesterday from the Disaster Relief Committee of Shishou County, Hubei Province, stating that since the purge of the Communist Party, remnants of the bandits had colluded with local bandits and rogue elements to establish a Soviet government in Yangbodang, Fengjiatan, Xiaochekou, and other places north of the county. They practiced the dictatorship of the proletariat, engaging in rape, murder, looting, and other extreme acts. In September of this year, Red bandits He and Liang led more than 10,000 people to repeatedly capture Shishou, taking the deputy head of the regiment, Zhang Jiachun, and county government officials Zhang Jian, as well as citizens Zou Keqing, and more than 60 others hostage, with 300 to 400 people held for ransom. The internal organizations of the bandit army, such as the various agencies and groups of the Soviet government, were extremely strict and well-organized. They practiced the equal distribution of land, confiscated assets, and treated murder as entertainment. They established skinning pavilions, skinned people alive, used blood to write on paper, poured kerosene on it, and staged a bloody new drama. They treated bestiality as evolution, practiced open sexual relations, and designated large and small assets for their insatiable desires. They used young boys and girls as tools for charging into battle, with flesh and blood flying everywhere. (There is a missing character) The lake changed color. Even Zhang Xianzhong and Li Zicheng could not match the bandits' cruelty. The suffering was severe, tragic, and cruel.</p>

He married a woman named Gu, who is now twenty-seven years old and has a daughter named Qiaodi, who is ten years old.

The next morning, when Xu returned home and found that his wife and daughter had run away, he posted small photographs of Gu and Qiaodi in the newspaper to look for them and reported to the police stations to investigate.</p>

<p>Investigation by the Chinese National Anti-Drug Association</p>
<p>Since its establishment in the Republic of China Year 13, the Chinese National Anti-Drug Association has conducted a nationwide survey of drug conditions annually. It compiles special collections based on actual situations in various regions, providing them to the authorities as references for implementing tobacco prohibition. Over the years, these have proven quite practical. Starting from the Republic of China Year 15, it expanded its scope to include nationwide courts, county governments, customs offices, post offices, railways, and other tobacco prohibition agencies, conducting separate investigations on their tobacco prohibition efforts. Annual statistics regarding various aspects of tobacco prohibition by these agencies from the three years of Year 15 to Year 17 have been successively published in newspapers. The materials for the Republic of China Year 18, after meticulous verification and statistical analysis by Zhou Chucai and others, the association's directors of investigation and statistics, have been completed and will be compiled into special collections by category. It is reported that materials were collected from 92 local courts across the country, excluding ten locations: Siming in Fujian, Longjiang in Heilongjiang, Huizhou in Guangdong, Guilin and Cangwu in Guangxi, Longzhou, Gaolan in Gansu, Kunming in Yunnan, Guiyang in Guizhou, and Zigong in Sichuan. These materials account for nine-tenths of the national total. Among them, nine local courts, including Zhaoqing, Chaozhou, Meizhou, Qiongyai, Nanshao in Guangdong, Chang'an in Shaanxi, Yongning in Guangxi, Chengdu, Luxian, and Baxian in Sichuan, reported no tobacco cases this year (Year 18). However, eighty-three local courts, including Jiangning and Shanghai in Jiangsu, handled a total of 16,772 opium cases from January 1st to December 31st of the Republic of China Year 18, involving 23,552 male and female tobacco offenders. Among them, 72 offenders were involved in planting poppy, accounting for 0.3% of all offenders; 1,266 offenders were involved in trafficking opium, accounting for 5.4%; 3,307 offenders were involved in selling opium, accounting for 14%; 17,514 offenders were involved in smoking opium, accounting for 74.4%; and 1,393 were involved in other offenses, accounting for 5.9%. The total number of tobacco offenders is listed by province as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e145">Issuance of Long-Term Ferry Passes <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Temporary Suspension of Sales for Shanghai-Gaoqiao Route</p>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities, considering the crowding of passengers on the municipal ferries (operating between the Bund on Nanjing Road and Pudong Goujian, soon to extend to Gaoqiao) and seeking to save time and money for frequent travelers, has obtained approval from the Municipal Government to issue term passes. The procedures are as follows: (1) Long-term passes are only sold at the General Management Office of the ferry, but each pier can also be entrusted to purchase them from the General Management Office, specifying the date of ticket collection. (2) Long-term passes are only for the purchaser's personal use. (3) Purchasers of long-term passes must first pay a photography fee of 60 cents to obtain a photography notification slip, which they should take to Wang Kai Photography Studio for a photo to be affixed to the ticket for verification. (4) Long-term passes are divided into three types: round trips between Shanghai and Qingningsi Temple, between Shanghai and Donggou, and between Shanghai and Gaoqiao. (5) The prices for each class of long-term passes are calculated based on one round trip per day. Purchasers can choose to buy for the whole year or several months, and stamps are affixed to distinguish them. The prices are as follows: (A) Round trips between Shanghai and Qingningsi Temple: Special class, $18 per month; First class, $12; Second class, $6. (B) Round trips between Shanghai and Donggou: Same as round trips between Shanghai and Qingningsi Temple. (C) Round trips between Shanghai and Gaoqiao: Special class, $25.20 per month; First class, $16.60; Second class, $8.40. (6) Long-distance long-term passes allow passengers to board and disembark at any pier along the way (i.e., those with passes for Shanghai-Gaoqiao can board and disembark at Donggou Qingningsi Temple, or Xidu; those with passes for Shanghai-Donggou or Qingningsi Temple can board and disembark at Xidu). However, the Gaoqiao port is not yet open, so all long-term passes for Shanghai-Gaoqiao are temporarily unavailable for sale.</p>

<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce received an order from the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs yesterday, stating: "To implement the order, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Weights and Measures reports that, in order to actively promote the new system, it has ordered manufacturing shops in the city to expedite the production of new instruments to meet demand. However, investigation reveals that promotion and manufacturing must go hand in hand to be effective. It is proposed that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce be instructed to order all fellow trade associations to comply with the new system in a uniform manner." Accordingly, it is found that the unified weights and measures instruments have been repeatedly ordered by the ministry to be completed by a deadline. This city is a major trading port with China and foreign countries and should take the lead in advocating and completing it as scheduled. According to the previous report, it is appropriate to order your association to instruct all fellow trade associations to comply with and handle the matter accordingly. This order.</p>

<p>The Chinese Jishang Association and the Morality Association are jointly organizing emergency relief in Jiangxi Province, with Zhang Xianqing elected as the director, and Peng and Li as deputy directors. Donation friends and others have already departed on the Jiangshun vessel on the 16th. It is understood that the association received a telegram from Director Zhang stating that Xian and sixteen relief friends had safely arrived in Nanchang and had assigned relief friends to various locations for investigation. They would depart that day. After the bandit disaster in Jiangxi Province, everything is desolate. Ice and snow cover the ground, and cries of distress fill the fields. Innocent compatriots have suffered this catastrophe. The tragic scene is heart-wrenching and difficult to describe in words. Recalling the discussions with you all in Shanghai, the mood is still vivid. The contrast between the two is truly like heaven and earth. Given the extent of the disaster here, the originally determined relief amount is far from sufficient. It is requested that you consider increasing it to benefit the disaster victims." It is reported that the first batch of 3,000 sets of relief clothing from the association were loaded onto the Jiangjing vessel on the 20th of this month and transported to Jiujiang. It is temporarily requested that Mr. Lin Yusheng of the China Merchants Bureau in Jiujiang store them until Director Zhang transports them to the disaster area for distribution.</p>

<p>Meeting of Creditors</p>
<p>There are Three Creditor Groups</p>
<p>The Situation is Very Tense</p>
<p>Creditors' Committee Tours Shanghai's Great World</p>
<p>The Savings Department and Day and Night Bank Creditors' Committee held their fourth meeting yesterday (the 25th). Eighteen attendees included Yang Dihua. Chen Jiejie was elected chairman. First, Tu Yunchao reported on the various proposed letters and drafts, which were unanimously approved. He then reported on the tragic suicide of an elderly woman surnamed Zhou from the same hometown who had been forced to take her own life. The atmosphere at the meeting was tense, and everyone was very indignant. The following motions were discussed: ㈠ It was resolved to send letters to the National Government departments and councils, as well as the Municipal Party Department, Municipal Government, Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and Social Affairs Bureau, which will be issued immediately. ㈡ It was resolved that due to the divergent organization of the creditors' group, there was a risk that speculators might take advantage of it for profit. The committee should issue a declaration to advise all creditors to pay attention to avoid future disputes. ㈢ It was resolved to send a letter to Huang Chujiu's aftermath committee tomorrow. ㈣ It was resolved that the committee would prioritize the interests of depositors. All operating expenses would be shared by the members, but they were unable to bear the huge advertising costs. A letter should be sent to all newspapers asking them to publish the committee's news and announcements as much as possible to facilitate publicity and provide assistance. ㈤ Tomorrow (the 26th), the French Concession Court will hear part of the creditor litigation cases. The committee should send representatives to attend the hearing for reference. ㈥ Representatives were designated to visit various agencies and the Huang residence on the 26th for negotiations. ㈦ It was resolved that to prevent outsiders from falsely using the committee's name, a formal statement should be sent to all newspapers.</p>
<p>Old Woman Attempts Suicide by Inhaling Opium: Tu Yunchao reported that an elderly woman surnamed Zhou from the same hometown was originally from a well-to-do family in Jiangxi. In recent years, due to the harm caused by the communists, her family property was exhausted, and her house was also burned down. She gathered the remaining ashes today, sold her clothes, and obtained more than two thousand yuan, fleeing to Shanghai. She deposited this amount in the Great World and Day and Night Bank, relying solely on it for food and clothing to sustain her life. Suddenly, withdrawals were stopped, and her livelihood was abruptly lost. Tragically, yesterday, she took raw opium suicide. Fortunately, relatives and friends discovered it and used kerosene to rescue her, and she was resuscitated. However, she is still not out of danger.</p>
<p>Petition to the Central Government for Relief: To the Nanjing National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Industry, We respectfully submit this petition. After the death of Shanghai businessman Huang Chujiu, his relatives and friends organized an aftermath committee to maintain Huang's remaining businesses, such as real estate, tobacco, pharmacies, native products, and cinemas, as usual. However, they declared that the Shanghai Day and Night Bank and the Great World Amusement Savings Department would be subject to committee liquidation. For many days, there has been no concrete action, causing the rights of tens of thousands of depositors to be shaken with anxiety, and their misery is indescribable. It is the common practice of banking institutions that operate savings businesses that their boards of directors and key personnel should bear unlimited liability. It is understood that the bank and the savings department were originally unlimited companies. Even if Huang's entire business were declared bankrupt, the bank and the savings department should still repay all depositors' principal and interest in full. Moreover, since other businesses are being maintained, the rights of the bank and the savings department should be paid off even earlier. We respectfully implore your government, yuan, and department to consider that these tens of thousands of depositors are all poor, ordinary people. Most have only a few hundred or a thousand yuan, while others have only a few tens or a few yuan. However, most of these are meager savings accumulated through hard work, frugality, and daily accumulation of blood and sweat. Once they suffer a loss, their lives and families are in danger. The cries of grief and tears of old women and men in front of the bank, savings department, and Huang's residence in recent days, as well as the calls to heaven and earth by shop assistants and laborers, are sufficient to prove that the rights of these two departments have a great impact on the economy of Shanghai's common people. We dare to earnestly request that you quickly order the Shanghai Municipal Government and Social Affairs Bureau to uphold justice and order the aftermath committee to repay the principal and interest of the bank and the savings department in full within the final deadline to protect the creditors' rights and comfort the public's expectations. The telegram does not express the urgency with which we await your orders. Respectfully, the Great World Amusement Savings Department, Day and Night Bank Creditors' Committee.</p>
<p>Letter to the Party Department and Municipal Government: To the Shanghai Municipal Party Department, Municipal Government, Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and Citizens' Federation, we respectfully address you. After the death of Shanghai businessman Huang Chujiu, his relatives and friends organized a handling committee to deal with Huang's affairs (omitted section). We request that the committee quickly set a deadline to repay all creditors' principal and interest in full. We earnestly beseech you to resolutely implement emergency measures to protect the creditors' rights and comfort the public's expectations. We cannot express the urgency with which we await your orders.</p>
<p>Letter to All Creditors: The Great World Savings Department, Day and Night Bank Creditors' Committee respectfully informs all creditors. As directed by the creditors' assembly to protect both branches, the proceedings and resolutions of our meetings have been successively disclosed to satisfy the expectations of the creditors' assembly. However, recent reports indicate organizational divisions and conflicting groups. While it is natural for each creditor to protect their own rights out of self-defense and self-interest, there are many speculators in Shanghai. They may take advantage of the creditors' urgent state of mind. On the surface, they may advocate for the interests of the public, but in reality, it is a kind of special business tactic. While registration today may seem to fulfill one's obligations, they will make demands on public funds when it comes time to receive payments. Lawyers and accountants are inherently commercial in nature. Even if they are enthusiastic and willing to fulfill their obligations, they will not sacrifice such huge advertising fees and other expenses for no reason. This is against common sense. It is even possible that the Great World and Day and Night Bank will fully repay the principal and interest, but the lawyers or accountants who volunteered to represent them will instead impose deductions and discounts. In this way, creditors who could have avoided losses will suffer unexpected sacrifices. This is what the committee is deeply concerned about. Entrusted by the creditors' assembly, each member of the committee has substantial claims. Therefore, they do not hesitate to sacrifice their spirit and money to take on the responsibility of protecting the rights of the masses and their own rights. Operating expenses are shared by the 27 committee members. Meetings are held until midnight, working on empty stomachs, without daring to complain of fatigue. To put it plainly, this is a purely public interest group to protect the rights of creditors with no private interests. Most of the creditors who have come to register in recent days understand this point. However, we cannot bear to see some creditors go astray and create future entanglements. Therefore, we sincerely inform you that we hope that creditors will not rashly register everywhere due to their urgency and suffer unexpected sacrifices. As for whether or not to register with this committee, it is up to you. However, we strongly advise against rashly joining other groups whose true intentions are unknown. We offer our sincere advice in hopes that you will take note of it. Furthermore, the committee's proceedings are conducted in accordance with the wishes of the public and legal and peaceful methods. We will never take any drastic measures. All crowds who voluntarily go to Huang's residence for inquiries or petitions are not led by this committee. The rights of our creditors can be fully guaranteed if we remain resolute, united and act in accordance with the law. There is no need to take direct action. This is stated and explained, we hope you will consider it.</p>
<p>Creditors' Group Established: Since the Shanghai Day and Night Bank and Great World Amusement Department announced liquidation, creditors have organized creditors' groups to deal with the situation. Previously, some creditors specially entrusted lawyer Bian Jialu to register and organize a creditors' group. Yesterday morning at 9:00, the group held its founding meeting at the Central Western Restaurant on Fourth Avenue. More than 800 registered creditors attended. Xu Peiyuan was elected chairman, and the ceremony was carried out as planned. First, the chairman gave a report, followed by a discussion of: ㈠ Carrying out litigation affairs in accordance with the law. ㈡ Warning Gongfa Company that it should bear unlimited liability. ㈢ Petitioning various party and government agencies for assistance. ㈣ Organizing an executive committee to handle all affairs of the group. Xu Peiyuan, Xu Jun, Hu Jingzhi, Xie Ganchen, Sun Choucheng, Liu Youshi, Wang Jinggu, Han Mingji, Yang Ji, Ding Mingzhou, Zhou Zhixue, Ding Juncai, He Yuanming, Cheng Jingji, and Liu Aishi, fifteen people were elected as executive committee members. The meeting adjourned at noon. Afterwards, the first executive committee meeting was held, chaired by He Yuanming. The ceremony was carried out as planned. First, the following was discussed: ㈠ Organizing a standing committee, electing Hu Jingzhi, He Yuanming, Cheng Jingji, Xu Jun, and Ding Mingzhou as standing committee members. He Yuanming, Xu Jun, and Zhang Chengchun were designated to draft the charter. A plan for organizing departmental offices was discussed, and it was resolved to divide them into three departments: general affairs, investigation, and public relations. The general affairs department would be divided into three sections: documentation, accounting, and general services. The standing committee members would take charge of each section. ㈣ The group's office will be temporarily located at 39 Avenue Edward VII. The standing committee decided to hold meetings twice a week. The meeting adjourned at 2:00 PM.</p>
<p>Creditors' Association News: The Day and Night Bank Great World Savings Department Creditors' Association, which has been using the law offices of Yan Luqing at 9 Avenue Edward VII for office and registration, has experienced overcrowding in recent days due to the increasing number of creditors joining the registration. Those who arrive later have to wait for a long time. Therefore, it has been decided to set up a separate registration office at Zhou Xiangtai Redwood Furniture Store, 224 Dongjie, Dadongmen, Nanshi. Furthermore, due to many creditors calling to say that they cannot spare the time to come for registration due to work, requesting registration to be possible between 12:30 PM and 2:00 PM or extending the hours after 6:00 PM, it has been specially decided to open for registration as usual from 12:30 PM to 2:00 PM and to extend the registration until 9:00 PM in the evening.</p>
<p>Furthermore, lawyer Yan Luqing sent a letter to the aftermath committee on behalf of the association, stating: "We have been informed by the Day and Night Bank Great World Savings Department Creditors' Association that after the death of Huang Chujiu, his Day and Night Bank and Great World Savings Department were entrusted to the aftermath committee for liquidation. However, there is no concrete guarantee for the savings. They had no choice but to hold the first creditors' meeting at your law firm on the 23rd of this month and issue a declaration. The savings of the creditors were accumulated bit by bit through frugality and hardship. Furthermore, at this time of severe winter, the weak will inevitably face danger to their lives, and the strong will resort to desperate measures. If assistance is not provided, social unrest is bound to occur. It is painful to say this. It is planned to follow the resolution of the first creditors' meeting and inform Mr. Yu, Wang, and Yuan of the aftermath committee to put forth efforts to achieve the goal of fully recovering the savings." Accordingly, this letter is sent on behalf of the association, and the first declaration of the Day and Night Bank Great World Savings Department Creditors' Association is attached for your perusal. Respectfully addressed to Mr. Yuan Ludeng, Wang Yansong, Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Ye Shantao, and Zhao Qinbo of the Huang Chujiu Aftermath Committee. Lawyer Yan Luqing.</p>

<p>Zhang Admitted to Embezzling More Than 4,000 Gold Coins</p>
<p>Zeng Xianzhi Files an Independent Private Lawsuit</p>
<p>Zhang Taijie, the general manager of the Chuanlu Company, was accused by shareholder representative Zeng Xianzhi and others in the District Court of embezzling more than three million in road funds. Zhang was sentenced to three years of imprisonment by the District Court. Zhang refused to accept the verdict and applied for appeal. After review by the High Court, the sentence was reduced to one year of imprisonment. He was immediately returned to the Shanghai District Court and sent to the second prison in Caohejing for execution. Now, Zeng Xianzhi and others have filed an independent private lawsuit based on Zhang Taijie's own admission of more than 4,000 gold coins. The trial was held yesterday by Judge Zhao. In addition to summoning the plaintiff, Zhang was also brought to the case. After the plaintiff's request, Zhang Taijie stated that the money was at the lawyer's office of Dong Yu. The judge then ordered Zhang to agree that he could pursue Dong Yu in the future, but Zhang was unwilling. Therefore, the debate was opened, and the judge adjourned the trial to await sentencing. Zhang was immediately returned to prison for execution.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Bureau Road Police Seize Bandit Weapon Cache <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Four Pistols Seized</p>
<p>One Woman Arrested</p>
<p>Yesterday at about 3:00 PM, Wang Shifu, the detective team leader of the Municipal Public Security Bureau in Zhabei, along with Huasheng Hua, a Western detective from the Concession Police Department, and bandits Wang Xuequan, Xu Liansheng, and Cao Zilian, traveled by car to the second district police station on Zhaozhou Road, South City. The report stated that the three criminals Wang, Xu, and Cao were bandits who robbed the Dingfeng Cigarette Paper Store on Haifang Road. According to the confession of the Wang criminal and others, all the weapons used in the crime are now hidden in the cake shop at 107 Bureau Road under your jurisdiction. Please send police to conduct a joint search. Upon receiving the report, Chief Wang immediately ordered detectives Cao Junda and Zeng Chufa and patrol officer Tian Shenyu to go together. As a result, a wooden case box numbered 203894, one Colt pistol, and three Browning pistols numbered 16435, 64202, and 63752, as well as 50 bullets, were found in the house. A woman, Wang Zhang, was arrested on the spot and taken to the station together. After a preliminary interrogation by Chief Wang, Zhang stated that she was 36 years old and from Funing. She was evasive in other details. After the interrogation, she was handed over to the detective team leader Wang Shifu to be taken to the headquarters for investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Abbot of Yuantong Temple Accuses Abbot of Sanguantang <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Fraudulently Claiming Land Price of 1,200 Yuan</p>
<p>Requests Court Order for Restitution</p>
<p>The abbot of Yuantong Temple on Zhoujiazui Road, monk Lingyan, recently hired lawyer Dai Jianen to file a lawsuit in the Special District Court against monk Baosheng, the abbot of the new Sanguantang Temple on Huaji Road, for fraud and illegal acquisition of property. The reasons were: The defendant was formerly the abbot of Yuantong Temple. However, due to indulgence in vices and excessive extravagance, he successively mortgaged the temple property illegally and was unable to maintain it. In 1919, he asked someone to intercede and obtained a deed, stipulating that the plaintiff would take over as abbot for a period of 30 years. Later, due to his growing debts, in April 1923, he again asked someone to intercede and obtained a deed, permanently handing over the temple. It was stipulated that after the handover, Baosheng would not interfere in any matters relating to the temple. Therefore, in January 1926, the plaintiff applied to the Shanghai County Magistrate's Office and was officially granted an edict by the plaintiff to be the abbot. In 1929, the plaintiff registered with the municipal government. Unexpectedly, in 1927, due to the widening of the road by the British Municipal Council, several sections of the temple land were used. The plaintiff entrusted lawyer Clive to negotiate with the Municipal Council. As a result, the Municipal Council agreed to issue 1,200 taels of silver for the land price. During the negotiation period, the defendant fraudulently collected the aforementioned land price of Yuantong Temple from the Municipal Council, illegally obtaining property benefits. The defendant had already handed over the temple previously, how could he commit fraud and illegally acquire property afterwards? Not only did it infringe upon the plaintiff's legal rights, but it also constituted Article 363 of the Criminal Code. Please investigate and handle it in accordance with the law and attach the civil part, requesting a judgment to recover the land price of 1,200 taels. The court, based on the statement, approved the ticket and on the day before yesterday afternoon, Judge Feng Shide came to the Criminal Court Three for interrogation. The defendant did not appear for interrogation. According to the plaintiff's agent, lawyer Dai Jianen, the case was stated. After reviewing the statements by Judge Feng, the case was rescheduled for further interrogation.</p>

<p>Groundbreaking Ceremony Held Last Saturday</p>
<p>After the Shanghai Telephone Company took over the concession telephone service, it is proceeding with its planned improvement and expansion in an orderly manner. A new switchboard room in the West District is currently being built at the south end of the intersection of Route des Soeurs and Avenue Haig to serve as the foundation for switching to automatic telephone service. The groundbreaking ceremony was held last Saturday. Major General McNaughton, the chairman of the Municipal Council, was invited to place the cornerstone. Before placing the stone, Mrs. McNaughton first placed a tightly sealed bronze box under the stone. The box contained several Chinese and Western newspapers from the city on that day, one large silver dollar, one double silver dime, one single silver dime and small silver coins and the latest telephone directory and company history, etc., for commemoration. After the box was placed, Major General McNaughton laid the cornerstone and gave a short speech. The ceremony concluded and dispersed.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Zhabei Public Bus Company Applies to the Public Utilities Bureau to Add Routes <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>From North Station to Hujiang University</p>
<p>Fares and Stations Have Been Proposed</p>
<p>The Zhabei Chinese Public Bus Company will add the fourth bus route, starting from the Baoshan Road entrance of the North Railway Station and ending at Hujiang University near Jungong Road, passing through Hongxing Road, Baoxing Road, Tiantong'an Road, Chih Tze University, Fudan University, and other places. It has submitted the plan, stop list, and fare schedule to the Public Utilities Bureau for review in recent days. Here is the original application and fare schedule:</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of submitting a request to open a new fourth bus route for public transportation, the company previously received Instruction No. 945 from your bureau in July 1930 regarding the Seventh District Party Department's request to open a public bus route from Xiangyin Road to Shenjiahang for transportation. At that time, the company pleaded that it could not meet the demand and requested permission to postpone it, which was reported on August 13 of the same year. Recently, Fudan University also made the same request. Considering that there are universities along the road and that a women's physical education college will also be built, the company plans to open a new route, designated as the fourth route. The operating plan is to start from the North Railway Station, pass through Tiyuhui Road, turn onto Jungong Road, and directly reach the entrance of Hujiang University. A trial operation will be conducted for three months. If the business can progress and be sustainable, it will continue to be operated. Otherwise, it will have to change direction and only dispatch vehicles to Fudan University. The fare schedule is listed separately and submitted for review. Sincerely, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Shanghai Chinese Public Bus Company.</p>

<p>Team Leader Sentenced to Two Years</p>
<p>A gang of sea bandits from Dongling Port outside Wusongkou landed and robbed more than 100 firearms from the police squadron. The team leader, Xu Guanxiong, was ordered by the Jiangsu Provincial Security Department to be dismissed from his post for investigation and sent to the province for trial. The trial has been concluded, and he has been sentenced to two years of imprisonment. He was returned to the Fourth Prison for execution yesterday. Meanwhile, orders were issued to the subordinates to strictly apprehend the gang of bandits and bring them to justice. Chief Zhang of the Fourth District of the Wusong Water Police also dispatched Team Leader Lin of the Eighteenth Team to join the suppression, it is said.</p>

<p>Xu Debiao and Chen Yaogui Escorted to Song for Strict Interrogation</p>
<p>The sea bandits outside Wusongkou have become rampant again. Recently, fishing families along the coast were extorted by the bandits for protection money. When they did not comply, more than 200 fishing boats were burned. After receiving the news, the team leaders of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Teams of the Fourth District of the Wusong Water Police immediately led the Jinghai, Pingyang, and Zhenhai gunboats, as well as the patrol boats of the two teams, to various coastal ports to suppress them. However, the sea bandits were extremely cunning and relied on the shallow ports and shoals around Da'an Port as a refuge. When the police ships arrived, the bandit ships immediately set sail and fled far away. The bandits who landed also disappeared without a trace. The day before yesterday, Team Leader Lin of the Eighteenth Team led a patrol boat to conduct a strict search for bandit traces along the coast. They soon received a tip that several sea bandits were hiding in Kan Shan Port and plundering there. Team Leader Lin immediately dispatched a team to suppress them. Two sea bandits, Xu Debiao and Chen Yaogui, were fortunately captured on the spot, and a hand-cranked cannon was seized. They have been escorted back to the team headquarters for strict interrogation.</p>

<h3 id="e163">Achievements of the Civil Mediation Office of the District Court <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Average of Sixteen or Seventeen Cases Settled Daily</p>
<p>After the Shanghai District Court established the Civil Mediation Office on January 1 in compliance with the ministerial order, initial cases involving money and property worth less than 1,000 yuan and personal lawsuits such as divorce and alienation were required to undergo mediation before a lawsuit could be filed. The District Court usually has more cases such as scattered debts and rent disputes than the two Concession Courts. Before the establishment of the Mediation Office, there were an average of more than 30 such lawsuits per day. There were also more personal lawsuits such as divorce than in the Concessions, with an average of four or five trials per day. Cases were not settled through litigation and even led to appeals, so cases could not be assigned in the past. Since the establishment of the Mediation Office, an average of sixteen or seventeen cases have been settled every day, so the number of lawsuits has been greatly reduced. Moreover, once mediation is established, its enforcement is faster, and the parties can save litigation costs. It is truly a good policy.</p>

<p>Mr. Zhu Chengzhang, the general manager of the National Products Bank, was previously ambushed by rioters and died of serious injuries. Everyone who heard of it mourned. Now, Song Ziwen, Kong Yongzhi, Wang Rutang, Qian Xinzhi, Xu Shiying, Zheng Lai, and others have initiated a memorial service. Their notice reads: "Respectfully informing you that Mr. Zhu Chengzhang was tragically ambushed and died with his aspirations unfulfilled. All relatives, friends, and former colleagues deeply lament his passing. We have specially initiated a memorial service to leave a memento and express our condolences. The ceremony will be simple and solemn, and we hope that all attending will break with convention and not send wreaths or memorial banners. We will also not provide tea, water, or transportation. The order of the ceremony will be printed and distributed on the day. We respectfully ask for your understanding. The location of the memorial service is the auditorium of the YMCA on Sichuan Road, Shanghai.</p>
<p>The date is February 8th at 3:00 PM. Attached is a note stating that Mr. Zhu served society with generosity and enthusiasm. He was always willing to do what was right in charitable endeavors. Therefore, his family has no savings, and his affairs after death are bleak. Moreover, his wife has long suffered from lung disease and requires constant medication. His elderly father is eighty years old, and his five children are all unmarried. Supporting and raising them is entrusted to no one. Seeing this tragic situation, we are deeply saddened. We plan to solicit donations to be used solely for supporting his family and the education of his children. If you wish to make a donation, please hand it to the following receiving banks and obtain a receipt. This is a formal declaration, and we hope for your understanding. The receiving banks are: Shanghai Bank on Ningbo Road, Shanghai; Guohua Bank; and China National Products Bank on Hankou Road, Shanghai."</p>

<p>A Letter from Elder Wukong</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Jisheng Association recently received a letter from someone signing himself as Elder Wukong. It stated, "I am a servant from Jiangsu, living in a remote village. Recently, my old wife passed away, and I feel lonely and sorry for myself. I realize that gatherings and partings in life are predetermined. Why regret the death of my wife in my old age? However, I recently read in the newspaper that floods, droughts, wars, and bandits are rampant throughout the country. Selling children is a heartbreaking sight. Although various charitable organizations are doing their best to provide relief, the funds are meager and the affected areas are vast, making comprehensive assistance difficult. I deeply worry about the disaster areas. I believe that I have been diligent and frugal throughout my life, and I am self-sufficient. My children are all married and can support themselves. Usually, I live frugally, saving dozens of yuan each month. I thought that even though the amount is small, many small contributions can make a large one. I am now remitting 148 yuan to your association for disaster relief to promote this idea. It is like a drop in the bucket, but it is a small contribution. What is regrettable is that the extravagance of society has reached its extreme. In the prosperity of Shanghai, countless amounts of money are spent on entertainment and material pursuits. If this extravagance could be reduced and used to help disaster victims, countless lives could be saved. I sincerely hope that someone will follow my example and expand this good deed, so that from one person to tens of thousands of people, the cold will be clothed, and the hungry will be fed. Perhaps sincerity can move Heaven, and the disaster can be quelled." In this decadent age, extravagance is still valued. If one thinks of the suffering of fellow countrymen in disaster areas and puts oneself in their place, one should find it difficult to sleep or eat. The elder's ability to use his hard-earned savings for disaster relief is commendable. Those who are not moved by this letter, I fear, will find the times even more unbearable to hear or ask about, with industry and commerce failing, agriculture desolate, refugees everywhere, and the starving filling the roads. Alas!</p>

<p>Additional Telegram Office</p>
<p>The Shanghai Bank has always been committed to serving society. To facilitate savings and payments for residents in the French Concession, a branch was established at 365 Avenue Joffre (west of the Paris Cinema). It opened for business on November 15th of last year. Recently, the branch has also contacted the Ministry of Communications, the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau, and the Wireless Radio Station to set up a sub-telegram office within the bank. Therefore, merchants and residents in the French Concession who wish to send wired or wireless telegrams domestically or internationally can send them to the sub-office nearby, saving time. The telegram office is open from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM, and from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM on Sunday mornings.</p>

<p>Letter to the Editor</p>
<p>To the Editor: Having read your newspaper's January 25th issue, in the "Local News" column, the news item "Disaster Relief Funds from Various Provinces Awaiting Allocation" includes the title "Chairman Wang Yiting" of the Shanghai Office Committee. Please note that Mr. Wang of our office is the Director, not the Chairman. The telegrams urging the disaster relief agencies of various provinces to send personnel to Shanghai to collect funds were handled by our headquarters in Nanjing. The allocation of funds by our office requires written instructions from our headquarters, instructing us to allocate funds to which province, before we can do so. It is not directly telegraphed by the Shanghai Office to the disaster relief agencies of various provinces to collect funds. This concerns the procedure for allocating funds, so we are sending a special letter to clarify this matter. We hope that your newspaper will make a correction to ensure accuracy. Sincerely, Disaster Relief Committee Shanghai Office January 25th.</p>

<p>Book Review</p>
<h3 id="e170">Tianlu Tanbao (Tianlu Talks About Newspapers) <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>(Continued) Tang Zengyang</p>
<p>After reading these two sections, we can not only learn about the origins of Chinese newspapers, but also gain a general understanding of the evolution of printed materials in Roman countries. The author's descriptions are based on facts and not fabricated. Moreover, the author uses economical methods, concise writing, and artistic beauty to express his ideas without any empty words. This is the greatest feature of this book.</p>
<p>This volume contains a wealth of material, such as "The Appearance of Newspapers," which describes "Content," "Origin," "Evolution," "Dibao (Official Gazette)," "Daily Records," "Newsletters," "Gazetta," and "Modern Newspapers." "The Source of News" describes "The Life of Newspapers," "The Story of News," "The Latest Introduction," and "Tianlu's Definition." The last section is especially noteworthy for readers because there are dozens of theories on the definition of news in any journalism book, and everyone has their own opinions, which can be very complicated. However, the author refers to the views of various scholars, adds his own correct opinions, and establishes a precise definition, which is very practical. In the chapter "Changes in Management," we can learn about the management of newspapers in different eras: (1) the era of individual management, (2) the era of political organizations, and (3) the era of joint-stock organizations. Other countries' newspaper content is also described in detail, such as "The Times During the British Parliamentary Era," "The Period of Political Organizations," "The Daily News During the Japanese Restoration," "The Period of Joint-Stock Companies," and "Modern American Commercialized Newspapers." This is enough to provide reference material for scholars studying newspapers. There are also "The Evolution of Paper," "Types of Formats," the location of advertisements, "Outline of Organization," "Completion of a Newspaper," "Newspaper Makers," "Female Journalists," "The Story of Reporters," "The Chinese Newspaper Industry," and "William Pettigrew's Newspaper Maxims," which are all good reference materials for newspaper studies.</p>
<p>The second part, "Anecdotes from the Newspaper World," describes interesting anecdotes of famous reporters from China and abroad, as well as historical materials about newspapers, such as "The Founding of Shen Bao," "Newspaper Historical Materials," and "Shi Bao Advertising Rates." These historical facts, which cannot be found in other journalism monographs, and personal anecdotes of reporters are even more valuable, allowing readers who have not entered the newspaper industry to understand the various anecdotes in the newspaper. This is truly a very enjoyable thing.</p>

<p>Tang Zengyang</p>
<p>Written by Huang Tianpeng</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the literary world in China is showing a state of poverty and weakness. For example, even now, there is no so-called standard "History of Chinese Literature." It is either narrowly describing forms mechanically or broadly including all Chinese knowledge in the research. However, the more systematic and accurate "History of Chinese Literature" and other great works still rely on Japanese scholars who have a deep understanding of Chinese studies. This is very shameful for us to hear. Now, when we look back at the form of Chinese news, it is also the same. Everyone knows that the origin of our country's newspaper industry is the earliest, but its development is extremely slow. It cannot keep pace with Europe and the United States, and it is even behind the so-called "small eastern neighbor." Of course, there are various reasons for this. On the one hand, the underdevelopment of education, industry, and transportation, and the instability of social order, have caused the majority of the people to be struggling in poverty and ignorance, failing to make them participate in the national and social plans, and cultivate an interest in reading newspapers. On the other hand, it is of course because the newspaper's own constitution is not very solid, and there are not many who are truly proficient in journalism talents. Therefore, we cannot provide better newspapers to the general public. Although the major newspapers in Shanghai have been advancing recently, this is very gratifying. But in the end, it has not been improved to become the newspaper of our dreams. Perhaps this will happen in the near future. As for specialized books on the study of the Chinese newspaper industry, they are even more "rare as morning stars" in the market. In addition to the richest of these books offered to the publishing industry by Mr. Huang, there are only one or two specialized works by Mr. Ge Gongzhen and Mr. Zhou Xiaoan that are worthy of our attention. Secondly, we can no longer find better good books. This is very different from the publishing industry in Europe, America, and Japan. This lack of specialized news books and the state of new newspapers not being very prosperous is similar to the literary world in China. In fact, the prosperity of a country's newspaper industry is closely related to its affiliated country. Now that our country's national politics has gradually entered the period of constitutional rule, and construction undertakings are gradually being revitalized, then we must also encourage and promote the newspaper industry and engage in the promotion of journalism education. In the future, we will make our country's newspaper industry flourish. It can be inferred from the development situation in Japan that there must be a surprising greatness to say. Therefore, the establishment of a journalism major by Fudan University in China is worthy of our attention. In specialized books on the correct study of our country's newspaper industry, then Mr. Huang's "Chinese Newspaper Industry," which was published not long ago, is worth recommending to readers.</p>
<p>The content of this book is extremely rich. First, in the first chapter, "Introduction to the Newspaper Industry," the author will give aspiring journalists a recognition of the characteristics of the newspaper industry. However, the world's people's determination for this is nothing more than this: "It is a public institution of mankind, a representative of public opinion, a broad social education, a synthesis of various arts, and a necessity for the general public," and so on. This also has sufficient reason, and it is worthy of providing a reference for the study of the newspaper industry. In addition to what is said here, the author is now adding his own research and experience and elaborating on it, such as "the public nature of the newspaper industry." This describes the relationship between the newspaper industry and the public. Newspapers should adhere to the principle of public interest, report accurate news, and contribute fair opinions. These are the correct paths it should follow. When we judge the value of newspapers, we can determine the measure by the amount of publicity it possesses. These are extremely accurate and insightful words. Secondly, it is about "the opinion of the newspaper industry." This point is very important. For example, the commentary in newspapers, it is not necessary to say that there is a clear proposition, Westerners often call newspapers the mouthpiece of the nation, and in our country, we often take the publication of newspapers to represent the social and public opinion as our duty. This means that newspapers must have their national and political existence. Initially, it represents the public opinion of the people to the government, then it represents the public opinion of the country to the international community, and finally, it represents the public opinion of the nation to mankind, so that life can be enjoyed forever. According to the current situation, newspapers are the representatives of public opinion, the rise and fall of a country's politics, the trend of national thought, and the state of social conditions can all be found in newspapers. This is a very insightful decision. From this, we can also understand the relationship between newspapers and the nation to which they belong. Mr. Huang's ability to pay attention to this point in this book is indeed worthy of our description. At the same time, the author also has a detailed explanation of the differences between the country and the nation. Secondly, it is about "the educational nature of the newspaper industry," "the artistic nature of the newspaper industry," which is "collecting the essence of several things to make a newspaper, and the blessing is not full, but it has already presented a grand view of art." This can actually be represented by this publication, as well as "the general nature of the newspaper industry" and the five characteristics. The author's arguments are all precise and unique. The second section is "The Definition of the Newspaper Industry," and the third section is "The Newspaper Industry and Life." The author's arguments in these sections are the result of his lifelong study of journalism, plus his judgment. The fourth section is "The Newspaper Industry and China." This is a precise explanation of the origin of the Chinese newspaper industry and its close relationship with China. Detailed quotations are given. The author said in the final paragraph, "Others, such as the compass for transportation and the Mengtian pen for writing, were all invented in China and were the forerunners of world civilization. We, inheriting this glorious history, should now work hard so that we will not be ashamed of the good reputation of our predecessors, and it is also the responsibility that we should have." The general idea is this, but seeing a glimpse of the relationship between this section and the whole book, and the importance of the development process of our country's newspaper industry, readers should not ignore this section. The fifth section is "The Editing Method of This Book," which is the outline of the whole book, and it is also necessary to read.</p>
<p>The second chapter is "The Origin of the Newspaper Industry": (1) Theory of Oral News, (2) News and Ballads, (3) Visiting and National Customs, (4) Records and Spring and Autumn Annals, (5) The Beginning of Official Newspapers. The third chapter is "The Changes of the Newspaper Industry," the fourth chapter is "The Rise of the Newspaper Industry," the fifth chapter is "The Current Status of the Newspaper Industry," the sixth chapter is "The Future of the Newspaper Industry," and the seventh chapter is "The Appendix of the Newspaper Industry": (1) National Newspaper Survey Record, (2) National Government Publishing Regulations, (3) A Chronicle of Major Events in the Newspaper Industry in the Past Century, and (4) A Catalogue of Newspaper Studies Books in Tianlu Xiaoyao Pavilion. Judging from the above, we can see the depth of the author's research and the vastness of the project. It is truly a great book that adds a lot of light to the Chinese publishing industry.</p>
<p>Because after reading this book, we can not only understand the historical facts of the Chinese newspaper industry in the past, the recent status quo and trends, how it will develop in the future, and the situation of national newspapers, these are all basic knowledge that newspaper people must know, and it can also provide assistance for our researchers to study.</p>
