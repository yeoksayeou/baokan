<p>時評</p>
<h3>美國减少天津駐軍</h3>
<p>以中國領土之內而有他國駐軍誠爲我國最可恥之一事夫外軍之來固由我中國所自召而其久駐不撤則藉口於我國保護外僑之不力與其不肯放棄法權撤銷租界同一理由也我國年來在內亂未定之際誠未敢自認爲保護外僑之周至然亦未嘗放棄其保護外僑之責任至一二傅教之士偶被土匪所據擾雖駐外軍亦無能爲力一旦土匪肅淸則此等事當然可不致再見且外軍之在中國亦未嘗無一二不法兵士擾我華民之事故外軍之駐在中國實際上於事無補或且轉傷兩國人民之感情况中國國民近正熱烈希望取消不平等條約而駐軍實爲不平等條約中之最甚者也</p>
<p>美政府前以中國統一有望議决撤退在中國一部分駐軍今對天津駐軍已下令實行减少矣吾人今後一方面督責政府盡力剿匪務使外僑之生命財産毫不發生危險一方面希望美國由减少而進至撤盡更希望其他各國同時將駐軍一律撤退爲撤廢不平等條約之先聲其有裨於國際間之友誼豈淺鮮哉</p>

<h3>胡佛主張緩付戰債之研究（再）（續）（彬）</h3>
<p>抑尤有進者道威斯計劃與楊格計劃即以美人道威斯與楊格爲會議主席所産生此種計劃之作成絕非偶然在會議之先實曾經華盛頓銀行家外交家之精密研究與考慮故道威斯計劃楊格計劃之實行即爲美國金元統治全歐計劃之實現</p>
<p>總之從大戰以後歐洲各國都無異於爲十四名華爾街著名銀行家所代表之美國帝國主義之外庫而自道威斯計劃與楊格計劃産生之後此種外庫更因德國賠欵之規定獲有實際可靠之準備金德國之工業原料資源關税税制貨幣制度一言以蔽之德國六千萬人民及全德國人民之經濟生活都透過國際銀行即協約國之手歸於美國掌握支配之下同時美國金元之貸予戰後歐洲各國及對德工業投資又使整個歐洲都屈服於美國金元之前俯首以受其支配在此吾人可以認定在歐戰中美國以軍事勢力作基礎在柏森哥將軍指揮之下於歐洲獲得堅固之地位戰後則以經濟勢力作基礎在道威斯計劃楊格計劃之下向歐洲獲得第二次勢力之擴張故道威斯計劃與楊格計劃之作成决非偶然而戰債與賠欵之關聯更非徵細</p>
<p>吾人旣已瞭然於戰債與賠欵之關聯矣茲請進而作此次胡佛主張緩付戰債一年結果之研究第一此種主張是否能得各國之接受第二此種主張之實行是否眞能挽救世界之不景况使資本主義經</p>
<p>濟得到穩定</p>
<p>第一緩付戰債一年之主張就事實之推測欲各國一致接受殆不可能退一步　亦必須經遇若干次之紛擾與爭辯並附有何種條件始能得各國一致通過</p>
<p>案胡佛宣言中之重要內容（一）爲美國明年將不督責二萬萬四千五百萬元戰時借欵之償還（二）爲同時美國尙須聯合各國使明年度該由德國償還之賠欵四萬萬二千五百萬美金延付假如胡佛之主張僅爲第一點而無第二點則各國之接受與實行殆惟恐落後而對於美國當戰感激靡極今胡氏之主張旣并提出第二點則各國之態度即大有研究之餘地蓋各國情勢各殊利害亦異故其對此種主張之態度萬萬不能一致也</p>
<p>德國在此精疲力竭之際對於賠欵正已無法應付而國内時呈騷動現象勢更岌岌可危明年四萬萬二千五百萬美金之賠欵正不知所自而出胡氏宣佈此次之主張正如雪裏送炭立釋德人之重負德國實受其惠自謝天謝地感恩戴德極表歡迎或且深惜美國未能多予緩付數年或竟提議取銷全部戰債及賠欵奥國在戰時與德爲同盟國戰後亦與德同爲戰敗國對此主張自亦接受無異論英國負美戰債最多本利共一百一十一億零五百九十六萬五千元法意諸國且爲英之債務國而對德賠欵之分得亦遠在法國之下賠欵與戰債之比犧牲僅爲二千零七十七萬一千金元對於胡氏主欵自有接受之可能同時英國爲嫉妒法國之大陸政策及法國戰後工業之發展久已與法分道揚鞭而與德握手言歡以期裁仰法國勢力之擴張故對於胡氏主張當更不至反對法國明年應從德國取得賠欵四千萬鎊而償美之債欵則只爲兩千萬鎊如戰債與賠欵連環緩付則法國明年將損失二千萬鎊法國在戰前固深畏德國戰後亦復時懼德國之復興以打破其戰後歐洲大陸覇主之企圖故對於連環緩付一年之主張必難接受就令將來格於國際情勢不能獨異亦必附有何種條件始能望其就範比國與法國國交素歡在凡爾塞和會上對德主張尤與法一致此次態度當不至與法國如何逕庭而且比政府明年預算旣已確交如明年賠欵緩付則將使此預算凈短五八·○○○·○○○佛郎對於胡氏主張當更有考慮之必要至於意國在一九二二年時首相墨索里尼即已有聲明戰債與賠欵不能分離並主張修改楊格計劃其目的蓋爲藉此主張可以拉攏德奥匃牙利土耳其保加利亞布置反法聯合戰綫以打破法國之大陸政策消滅法國對意威脅此次對連環緩付之主張當不至變換原來態度此外如日本雖對美毫無償付戰債之義務而對德有收取賠欵之權利但世界經濟衰落之緩和於日總可以予以多少間接之利益假如各國態度都能一致日本自亦無堅持某種主張之可能以上分析皆以各國實際情形爲根據各國利害關係之不能一致旣如上述則雖人心大都趨向於希望胡氏主張之能得實現但其前途總有不少難關不少爭持就令斡旋與呼籲之結果將來能得大體上之一致但另附條件或更提出另種主張則殆爲必然之形勢</p>
<p>總之美政府一向對於戰債方針極爲堅决即極力避免戰債與賠欵之併爲一談此次一聲霹靂胡佛總統忽然提出連環緩付之主張固非由於對德之仁慈或對全世界人民生活之哀憫而實爲自利蓋物價低落巿塲停滯年來已足予美國工業以極大之威脅若茲後美國對於債務國催逼必如猶太人一鎊錢換一鎊肉之付債辦法則焦頭爛額之債務國以及最後債務國之德國勢必惟有更加緊擴大其工業出産以期獲得盈利償付戰債但歐洲各國生産擴大對美工業之威脅將更爲嚴重於美無益亦可顯見况美國旣擁有鉅大之債權佔有世界金額可有量十分之四金融顯呈集中之勢而對外貿易又年爲出超無以調劑年年進益在美國固可以集中全世界金元大腹便便傲視全球但美國之所以富即世界各國之所以貧將來世界極端困窘巿塲極端萎縮華盛頓富翁之工業生産恐亦將興起英雄無用武地之感嘆世界各國正苦於缺乏資本之日亦即華盛頓富翁爲資本過剩而受苦之時利害相權暫</p>

<h3>接專論</h3>
<p>時放鬆其榨壓世界血肉之鐵榨固有必要又况所謂緩付實非不付一時緩付債權固仍在也美國旣無實害而蒙實益連環緩付主張之提出尤爲聰敏債主必採之手段故胡氏此次提議决非魔鬼忽發善心而爲基於已國實際利益上再四研究考慮之結果也英國旣爲自國實際利益而提出主張他國亦何莫不基於其本國利益而詳加考慮以决定態度觀察眼光之不同與步趨之不一致事實固早已加以説明而無須吾人細予分析矣</p>
<p>第一問題旣已解答茲再進而研究第二問題吾人對於第二問題之答案可乾脆答覆爲不能理由如下</p>
<p>自胡氏提出此次主張後説者謂年來經濟蕭條實由於消費力减退巿塲委縮生産過剩緩付戰債即所以减輕歐洲人民之負担而增加其消費能力以恢復巿塲以打破世界之不景况促進世界繁榮之復興甚且有人謂戰債之負担實爲致世界經濟蕭條之主因對於胡氏主張不勝其欣愉與誇揚一若戰債緩付即可使世界立臻繁榮此實大錯固然就某點言之此説固不無理由但就全部言之則此説容有未盡</p>
<p>蓋近年世界不景况之造成不僅由於美國戰債之榨壓尙有下列數項要因（一）因近工業之合理化（二）因農業品之過剩堆積及價格低落（三）因歐洲以外諸國如加拿大巴西智利日本澳大利亞及歐洲各小國如荷蘭瑞典東歐諸國先後工業化上述各國之工業化足以使工業先進國失去工業品之銷路即失去國際巿場（四）因各國「探併」政策之實行所謂探併政策即一方面提高入口關税使國外不業品農業品不易侵入各本國國內巿塲於另一方面向國外以極低之價格傾銷産品故探併政策之實行更足使國際巿塲縮小而因産品傾銷之損失國內消費力愈薄（五）因年來金價高漲銀價低落使世界行銀本位之國家受絕大之迫害甚至使其國家陷於破産之地位人民經濟生活亦被陷於極端貧困影響所至自足使消費力鋭减（六）因種種天災人禍使社會經濟益見貧困（七）因各國軍備之擴張使人民軍費負担加重生活因之益加艱難（八）戰債之榨壓以上八因都互相連帶互爲因果但都爲産生今日世界不景况之因素而胡佛今乃欲以緩付戰債及賠欵一年以挽救世界之不景况是何可能但胡佛主張之提出蓋亦無辦法中之辦法耳</p>
<p>茲再退一萬步言之就目前世界經濟情况觀察緩付一年戰債及賠欵是否即能予歐洲諸國以甦息就令一年以內稍得甦息但决無永久繁榮之可能</p>
<p>故根據事實以推測胡佛氏此次連環緩付主張之提出其結果可斷定爲（一）欲得各債務國一致之接受極多挫折（二）就令各國接受實行亦不能挽救世界之不景况吾人逆料繼此而後華盛頓政府或更將召集軍縮會議及銀價會議以作第二劑藥方之投試謂予不信請拭目以觀其後</p>

<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>之　話略同亦否認卜安是軍人古物保管委員會委員劉復昨特致函韓德威質問卜安究係何種學者原函如後韓德威先生台鑒閲報端所載先生談話有「至所謂卜安爲軍人一節因法國人民均須當兵與中國情形稍異實則均係學者此點或不無誤會」云云鄙人以深信以先生所處地位又爲西方崇拜耶教之人决不至犯十誡之一而説謊謹提出疑問兩點（一）卜安旣非軍人何以十八年夏季來平接洽時在中法大學正式宴會席上穿軍禮服而其餘諸法人均穿普通夜禮服（二）卜安旣「均係學者」究竟所專習者</p>
<p>是何種科學曾在何處大學或專門學校畢業得有何種學位或文憑曾在何處學校任教授在何處學術機關服務有何著作在何處出版曾被何種有名學會邀爲會員以上兩點敬希明確答覆仍在報端發表勿使大衆懷疑貴國對於「學者」二字之解釋「與中國情形稍異」因而「或不無誤會」也敬頌台安劉復六月二十二日</p>

<h3>收回揚子碼頭案昨聞</h3>
<p>交部派員到滬辦理</p>
<p>會同滬航政局進行收回浦東揚子碼頭案交通部已於昨日派遣專員徐師丹到滬會同上海航政局進行辦理華東社記者昨訪上海航政局長奚定謨於其私邸交通部派遣來滬之徐專員亦在座詢答甚詳茲分誌如下</p>
<h3>碼頭歷史</h3>
<p>奚徐兩氏云浦東揚子碼頭向爲德人産業吾國於民國六年九月因參與歐戰關係與德斷絕國交將該碼頭一切實行没收翌年（民國七年）交通部將揚子碼頭連同小火輪及一切辦公器具租與日商海洋社當時租價每月七百兩旋增至一千四百兩</p>
<h3>歷年積欠</h3>
<p>日商海洋社自民七租用揚子碼頭後初按月付租金並不拖欠其後自民國十二年七月起始停止付租直至二十年四月止共計積欠租金十三萬五千六百兩</p>
<h3>會同交涉</h3>
<p>交通部爲保護産權計按照合同取消其租借權故已遣派徐君到滬會同上海航政局進行辦理并在浦東揚子碼頭張貼交通部佈吿通知中外各輪船禁止在該碼頭停泊</p>
<h3>抗租原因</h3>
<p>海洋社因何抗納租金以日商海洋社之無理原因殊堪發噱據日方聲稱於民國六年時湖南造幣廠曾欠日本昭和商業會社銅價銀三十八萬五千六百四十二兩據海洋社之意揚子碼頭租金須於該項欠欵上扣除此種不明法紀之抗租原因誠聞所未聞前湖南造幣廠之拖欠銅價當時財政部未曾核准不能有效况前湖南造幣廠欠昭和商業會社與海洋社之欠交通部不能異題並論刻已奉令交涉當努力進行辦理云</p>
<h3>日方表示</h3>

<h3>？？？（四）</h3>
<p>— 徐卓呆</p>
<p>時候還早子良要趕做自已的工作了再回到樓上不到房裏到後面的亭子間裏這是子良的書室他把校裏帶回來一大包作文簿打開來正要翻閲樓梯上一陣足聲夫人來了：</p>
<p>「今天吃什麽小菜娘姨要去買了」</p>
<p>夫人似笑非笑的問着</p>
<p>「這些事你作主好了何必來問我呢」</p>
<p>「那不能夠此刻我做了主吃的時候你不愛吃就要怪我了」</p>
<p>「没有啊」</p>
<p>「没有昨天晚上你還説過咧」</p>
<p>「昨天晚上我因爲你天天給我吃黄豆芽我吃得怕了所以呌你以後少買」</p>
<p>「你從前説過黄豆芽好吃所以我天天給你吃」</p>
<p>「憑你山珍海味天天吃就乏味了」</p>
<p>夫人聽了對子良一笑：</p>
<p>「到底今天吃什麽你想啊」</p>
<p>「這些是主婦的事我那裏有工夫想」</p>
<p>子良眼睛看着剛才展卷的一本學生作文簿這麽回答夫人</p>
<p>「你吃倒要吃的想小菜要我一個人想太不平等了這麽辦罷我們各人想一樣我打算吃銀魚炒腰子你看可好」</p>
<p>「無論什麽都好」</p>
<p>子良很覺厭煩似乎要伊快些去了可以入手改一百多本作文卷子咧</p>
<p>「那末我的一樣有了你也得想一樣啊」</p>
<p>「百葉炒肉絲你去罷」</p>
<p>子良隨隨便便一説以爲夫人可以就下樓去吩咐娘姨了：那知伊還立着不動：</p>
<p>「今天是星期日小菜應當考究一點説不定可以再弄一隻湯我自已動手把去年烹調傅習所學習來的本領放些出來給你看看包你吃了就會佩服我」</p>
<p>夫人説罷方始從身邊摸出一大元來走向樓下去了</p>

<h3>法將福煦歐戰日記</h3>
<p>— 顧昂若譯</p>
<p>然而德軍雖在這次大戰没有得着戰略的勝利但這方面的戰事隨時可以重新聞始敵人一面可用潛水艇擾亂隣近海面截斷聯軍與英國的交通使英倫三島孤立無援一面可以大隊人馬以絕大的犧牲直趨海峽海岸所以聯軍的地位尙没有轉危爲安</p>
<p>我軍失守許多地方使德軍高據克末爾山聯軍防綫北面的屏藩法蘭特山岌岌可危假使我軍防線要免於動搖法蘭特山地務必全力固守我因令米脱里司令非但要鞏固法蘭特山的防線並且要佈防到山麓以免敵軍圍困山巔及偷渡山腰五月四日北面支隊局部作戰對於這點獲得相當的進展</p>
<p>法蘭特之戰還有一個結果就是裴塞内煤區也受着德軍砲火的轟擊礦工因發生嚴重的不安兵工廠及鐵路需用的煤遂大受打擊幸得英軍及駐隨英軍總司令部法軍聯絡官的努力這種形勢遂得補救</p>
<p>聯軍實力經法蘭特一役大受損失英軍後備隊早已用盡無遺調去助戰的法國後備軍已有十師之衆</p>
<p>我同海格總指商定把退出火線的英軍後備隊調到法綫平靜區域交給貝當司令改編法軍也撤退一部補充後備隊但這種調動只能緩緩實行貝當司令首先把第九軍圑的英軍四師編入法國第六軍五月中旬調往克龍洛佛爾綫駐防</p>
<p>法蘭特之役鏖戰一月之久法軍的佈置失其平均五月初法軍在疴亞斯河之北的有四十七師之衆（二十三師在前綫二十四師爲後備）從疴亞斯河到瑞士邊境的防綫駐守的軍隊只有五十五師就是四十三師在前綫十二師爲後備貝當司令請我注意這種形勢所産生的危險</p>
<p>英軍所受的重大損失不能不加以顧慮但敵人在疴亞河與雷斯沙之間有再攻的可能更因這綫與决勝的目標相隔甚近勝敗與聯軍有極大的影響我因在沙姆河之北維持四師兵力並以同樣兵力配置在沙姆河之南至於調兵接濟北面支隊並不因之變更</p>
<p>同時我竭力調度美軍以利法軍總司令的軍務美軍第一師已在四月廿六日開入法國第一軍的防綫五月廿八日一戰即克復康體尼村證明美軍的戰鬥力不弱我請潘興司令即刻把第廿六第四十二及第二諸師調往前敵以美國步兵第卅二第三及第五諸師留作法軍的援兵我更請他派遣美國飛機師赴法空軍隊實習及減輕法空軍隊員的工作（未完）</p>

<h3>The United States Reduces Troops Stationed in Tianjin</h3>
<p>That a foreign country stations troops within Chinese territory is truly one of the most shameful things for our country. The arrival of foreign troops was originally invited by China itself, and their long-term stationing without withdrawal is based on the pretext of our country's ineffective protection of foreigners and the same reason for their unwillingness to abandon extraterritoriality and abolish concessions. In recent years, our country has not dared to consider itself thorough in protecting foreigners at a time when internal strife has not been settled, but it has never given up its responsibility to protect foreigners. Even if one or two missionaries are occasionally occupied and harassed by bandits, even stationed foreign troops are powerless. Once the bandits are suppressed, such things will naturally not be seen again, and the stationing of foreign troops in China has never been without one or two lawless soldiers harassing our Chinese people. Therefore, the stationing of foreign troops in China is actually of no help, or even harms the feelings of the people of both countries. Chinese citizens are currently fervently hoping to abolish unequal treaties, and the stationing of troops is the most severe of the unequal treaties.</p>
<p>The US government previously considered that China had hopes of unification and decided to withdraw some of its troops stationed in China. Now it has ordered a reduction in the number of troops stationed in Tianjin. In the future, on the one hand, we will supervise and urge the government to do its best to suppress bandits and ensure that the lives and property of foreigners are not in danger in any way. On the other hand, we hope that the United States will advance from reducing to completely withdrawing its troops, and even more hope that other countries will withdraw their troops at the same time, as a prelude to the abolition of unequal treaties. Its benefit to international friendship is not insignificant.</p>

<h3>US Secretary of State to Depart for Europe Today</h3>
<p>Will Meet with British, French, German, and Italian Authorities to Discuss the Postponement of War Debts</p>
<p>US Treasury Secretary Arrives in Paris for Preliminary Consultations, Date of Meeting Between German and French Political Leaders Undetermined, Japan's Attitude Follows Other Countries' Lead, Germany's National Silver Reserve Decreases</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 25th: Secretary of State Stimson told reporters here today that at the behest of President Hoover, he is scheduled to depart for Europe on Saturday to meet with the foreign affairs authorities of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy, and plans to meet with French President Doumergue. Stimson is scheduled to arrive in Naples, Italy, on July 2nd, Paris on the 15th, Berlin on the 21st, and London on the 27th.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Berlin, 25th: The issue of the US president's moratorium on debt payments has gradually narrowed down into a dispute between the United States and France. German newspapers are paying close attention to this matter and are unsure which opinion between the US and France will ultimately prevail, hence the speculation and conjecture. Furthermore, US Treasury Secretary Mellon has now arrived in France and has met with French Finance Minister Flandin. According to sources from the American community in Paris, Mellon is firmly committed to assisting Germany because Germany's current economic situation cannot be remedied without a thorough solution, hence the Young Plan must be temporarily suspended, and various reparations payments must also be temporarily halted. Based on the above reports, the German people can hold an optimistic attitude, but conservative newspapers still fear that America's goodwill will ultimately be obstructed by France and become a pipe dream.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 25th: US Treasury Secretary Mellon arrived here from England at 5:30 this evening, claiming that he himself does not know how many days he will stay in Paris. He did not know he had a formal mission when he first arrived in London. From this, it can be seen that Mellon's mission is indeed formal. After his work in Paris, Mellon will go to the famous coastal resort of the Riviera.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 25th: French and German politicians will soon meet in Paris, similar to when the British and German prime ministers met at the British prime minister's villa. However, French Prime Minister Briand has notified the German ambassador that the French government is willing to meet with German Chancellor Brüning and Foreign Minister Curtius as soon as possible to discuss issues concerning the two countries. The German chancellor and others are expected to arrive in Paris around July 4th and stay for two days before returning to Berlin.</p>
<p>Guomin, Berlin, 25th: In addition to the Hoover Plan, the most important issue today is the meeting between German and French politicians. It is reported that the French government has expressed its willingness to invite the German chancellor and foreign minister to France for talks, but the German chancellor and foreign minister are unlikely to be able to leave before the domestic economic problems are resolved. Furthermore, Chancellor Brüning's actions should be extremely cautious because the United States is trying to persuade France to understand the debt moratorium, hence he does not want to interfere with or exceed the actions of the United States. However, if the Hoover Plan can be established as the United States expects on July 1st, then the talks between German and French politicians can also be expected to materialize in the first week of July.</p>
<p>Paris, 25th: According to today's announcement, Prime Minister Laval has instructed Foreign Minister Briand that he is extremely willing to invite German Chancellor Brüning and Foreign Minister Curtius to France. The notice did not mention the date of the meeting between the two countries' politicians, hence the reports in various newspapers are inconsistent. Some say it may be held as early as next Sunday, while others say it may be difficult to materialize even in mid-July. In fact, the date has not yet been determined.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 25th: The Italian ambassador stated to Secretary of State Stimson today that Italy's acceptance of President Hoover's proposal for a moratorium on war debts has no political implications. The French ambassador also met with the Secretary of State, but the content of their conversation was not disclosed.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 26th: It is reported that the Cabinet has decided that Japan does not need to announce its attitude towards the Hoover proposal at this time because Japan has not received formal notification. If other countries agree, Japan is also prepared to agree.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 25th: Today's statistics from the German National Bank show that the banknote reserve is currently 40.4%, only 0.4% higher than the legal minimum. The reserve amount last month was 68.4%. The decrease in reserves is due to the large outflow of foreign currency from Germany in the past week, but the bank is confident that it will rapidly recover.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 26th: The New York Times published an opinion today stating that President Hoover is now paying attention to the dangers of economic decline in Latin America. After the situation in Europe is settled, he may convene a conference to discuss the issue. The Latin American countries do not owe the United States any debts, so there is no possibility of announcing a moratorium. It seems that the treasury will provide small loans or encourage banks to raise funds on their behalf to alleviate their financial pressures.</p>
<p>Reuters, Pretoria, 26th: The government of South Africa has accepted President Hoover's suggestion and allowed Germany to suspend the payment of reparations due to South Africa for one year.</p>

The Pope, in meeting with pilgrim believers, declared that the harmony between the Vatican and Italy has unfortunately deviated from the norm and has not yet recovered, which is regrettable, etc. People in the Vatican expect this declaration to be the basis for the Vatican's renewed diplomatic rhetoric with Italy. Future official documents will reiterate Italy's violation of the treaty. In addition, it is widely reported that the Pope will soon issue a circular condemning nationalism. It is said that this letter was prepared long ago, but was temporarily shelved due to the urgent global political situation. The Pope now believes that the time has come to publish it.</p>

<p>Continuing to Irkutsk at a Speed of 120 Miles Per Hour</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 25th: This season is very conducive to long-distance flights. American aviators Post and Gatty have established a new record for crossing the Atlantic Ocean and arrived safely in Moscow at 5:30 this evening.</p>
<p>Reuters, Vorms, 26th: American aviators Post and Gatty are poised to break all records for circumnavigating the world. At 5:00 this morning, the two departed from Moscow and flew to this location. It was expected that they would arrive at 8:00 in the afternoon. Their flight distance is 1,583 miles, and they need to fly an average of 120 miles per hour. However, at 2:05 p.m. (Moscow Standard Time), they flew past this location and continued to Irkutsk. Their average speed per hour should be 170 miles. A grand welcome was prepared here, but the two aviators changed their plans midway and did not come, so the crowd was quite disappointed, but everyone was amazed by the two's achievements. After Post and Gatty arrive in Irkutsk, they will go to Chita, Khabarovsk, and Spassk. After arriving in Spassk, they will add fuel for the final leg of the flight, which is to cross the Pacific Ocean and return to the United States.</p>

<h3>A Study of Hoover's Proposal to Defer War Debts (Continued) (Bin)</h3>
<p>Moreover, the Dawes Plan and the Young Plan were produced with Americans Dawes and Young as chairmen of the meetings. The creation of such plans was not accidental. Prior to the meetings, they had undergone thorough research and consideration by Washington bankers and diplomats. Therefore, the implementation of the Dawes Plan and the Young Plan was the realization of the US's plan to dominate Europe with gold.</p>
<p>In short, since the Great War, the European countries have been no different from being foreign treasuries of US imperialism represented by fourteen famous Wall Street bankers. Since the Dawes Plan and the Young Plan were created, these foreign treasuries have gained practical and reliable reserves due to the provisions for German reparations. Germany's industrial raw materials, resources, tariffs, tax system, and monetary system, in a word, the economic lives of Germany's 60 million people and the entire German people are all controlled and dominated by the United States through international banks, i.e., the hands of the Allied countries. At the same time, the lending of US gold to European countries after the war and the industrial investment in Germany have made all of Europe submit to US gold and bow to its control. Here, we can recognize that during the European War, the United States gained a solid position in Europe with military force as its foundation under the command of General Pershing. After the war, it gained a second expansion of power in Europe with economic force as its foundation under the Dawes Plan and the Young Plan. Therefore, the creation of the Dawes Plan and the Young Plan was by no means accidental, and the connection between war debts and reparations is even less insignificant.</p>
<p>Now that we have understood the connection between war debts and reparations, let us proceed to study the results of Hoover's proposal to defer war debts for one year. First, can this proposal be accepted by all countries? Second, can the implementation of this proposal truly save the world's recession and stabilize the capitalist economy?</p>
<p>First, based on factual speculation, it is almost impossible for all countries to accept the proposal to defer war debts for one year unanimously. Taking a step back, it must go through several disturbances and debates and have certain conditions attached before it can be unanimously adopted by all countries.</p>
<p>According to the important contents of Hoover's declaration: (1) the United States will not urge the repayment of the US$245 million in wartime loans next year; (2) at the same time, the United States must unite with all countries to defer the US$425 million in reparations that Germany is due to repay next year. If Hoover's proposal were only the first point and had no second point, then all countries would almost fear falling behind in accepting and implementing it, and would be extremely grateful to the United States for its war efforts. Now that Hoover's proposal has also raised the second point, then all countries' attitudes have much room for consideration. Because each country has different situations and different interests, their attitudes towards this proposal cannot be consistent.</p>
<p>Germany, at this time of exhaustion, is already unable to cope with the reparations, and the domestic situation is even more precarious due to frequent disturbances. It is not known where the US$425 million in reparations next year will come from. Hoover's announcement of this proposal is like sending charcoal in the snow, immediately relieving the Germans of their heavy burden. Germany is truly benefited by it, and is extremely grateful and thankful, or perhaps deeply regrets that the United States could not grant a longer deferral of several years, or even proposes to abolish all war debts and reparations. Austria was Germany's ally during the war, and after the war, it was also a defeated country along with Germany. It will accept this proposal without any objection. Britain owes the most in war debts to the United States, with a total of 11.1 billion, 596,500 dollars in principal and interest. France, Italy, and other countries are also Britain's debtor countries, and the share of German reparations they receive is far below that of France. The sacrifice in the ratio of reparations to war debts is only 20,771,000 gold dollars. Britain has the possibility of accepting Hoover's proposal. At the same time, Britain has long been jealous of France's continental policy and the development of French industry after the war, and has long parted ways with France and shaken hands with Germany in order to cut off France's influence and limit the expansion of French power. Therefore, it will not oppose Hoover's proposal. France is due to receive 40 million pounds in reparations from Germany next year, and its debt payments to the United States are only 20 million pounds. If war debts and reparations are deferred in a chain, then France will lose 20 million pounds next year. France deeply feared Germany before the war and is still afraid of Germany's revival after the war to break its ambition to dominate the European continent after the war. Therefore, it will be difficult to accept the proposal for a chain deferral for one year. Even if it is forced by the international situation to not be different, it must have certain conditions attached before it can be expected to comply. Belgium has always had friendly relations with France and was especially consistent with France in its demands on Germany at the Versailles Conference. Its attitude this time will not be different from France's in any way. Moreover, the Belgian government's budget for next year has already been finalized. If the reparations are deferred next year, then this budget will have a net shortfall of 58 million francs. There is even more need to consider Hoover's proposal. As for Italy, Prime Minister Mussolini had already stated in 1922 that war debts and reparations cannot be separated and advocated modifying the Young Plan. Its purpose was to use this proposal to win over Germany, Austria, Hungary, Turkey, and Bulgaria to form an anti-French united front in order to break France's continental policy and eliminate France's threat to Italy. It will not change its original attitude towards the proposal for a chain deferral this time. In addition, although Japan has no obligation to repay war debts to the United States, it has the right to collect reparations from Germany. However, the mitigation of the global economic recession can always provide Japan with some indirect benefits. If the attitudes of all countries can be consistent, Japan will naturally have no possibility of insisting on a certain proposal. The above analysis is all based on the actual situation of each country. The inconsistency of the interests of each country is as described above. Therefore, although people mostly tend to hope that Hoover's proposal can be realized, there are always many difficulties and disputes in its future. Even if the result of mediation and appeals can achieve a general consensus in the future, it is almost a certain situation that other conditions will be attached or other proposals will be put forward.</p>
<p>In short, the US government has always been extremely resolute in its war debt policy, that is, it has tried its best to avoid combining war debts and reparations into one. This time, President Hoover suddenly proposed a chain deferral, not because of his mercy towards Germany or his compassion for the lives of people around the world, but because it is actually for self-interest. The fall in prices and the stagnation of the market have been enough to pose a great threat to American industry in recent years. If the United States forces the debtor countries to repay their debts as if the Jews demanded a pound of flesh in exchange for a pound of money, then the debtor countries with scorched heads and battered faces, as well as Germany, the last debtor country, will only have to expand their industrial production in order to obtain profits to repay their war debts. However, the expansion of production in European countries will be an even more serious threat to American industry, which will be of no benefit to the United States. Moreover, the United States already has huge debts, accounting for 40% of the world's gold, and its finances are obviously concentrated. Moreover, its foreign trade is in surplus every year, with no way to adjust it. It can accumulate gold from all over the world in the United States, become fat and arrogant, and look down on the world. However, the reason why the United States is rich is that all countries in the world are poor. In the future, when the world is extremely distressed and the market is extremely withered, the industrial production of the wealthy Washingtonians may also give rise to a feeling that heroes have no place to use their talents. At a time when countries around the world are suffering from a lack of capital, the wealthy Washingtonians will also be suffering from a surplus of capital. When weighing the pros and cons, temporary</p>

<h3>Excerpt from Special Articles</h3>
<p>It is indeed necessary to relax the iron grip that is squeezing the flesh and blood of the world. Moreover, so-called deferred payments are not equivalent to non-payment; the creditor's rights remain valid even with temporary delays. The United States incurs no actual loss while reaping real benefits. The proposition for a chain of deferred payments is a particularly clever tactic that creditors will inevitably adopt. Therefore, Mr. Hoover's proposal is not a sudden act of kindness from a devil, but the result of repeated research and consideration based on his country's actual interests. Since Britain is proposing this for its own practical benefits, why shouldn't other countries carefully consider their own national interests when deciding on their attitude? Different perspectives and inconsistent actions have already been explained in the facts and do not need further analysis.</p>
<p>The first question has been answered, and now we move on to study the second question. Our answer to the second question can be a straightforward "no." The reasons are as follows:</p>
<p>Since Mr. Hoover made his proposal, some have argued that the economic recession in recent years is due to declining consumption and shrinking markets, with overproduction. Deferring war debts would reduce the burden on the people of Europe, increase their consumption, restore markets, and break the world's economic downturn, promoting the recovery of global prosperity. Some even believe that the burden of war debts is the main cause of the world's economic recession, and they are overjoyed and exaggerated about Mr. Hoover's proposal, as if deferring war debts would immediately bring global prosperity. This is a big mistake. Of course, this statement has some merit from a certain point of view, but it is not entirely comprehensive.</p>
<p>The recent global recession is not only due to the exploitation of American war debts but also to the following key factors: (1) Rationalization of modern industry; (2) Overproduction and low prices of agricultural products; (3) Industrialization of countries outside Europe, such as Canada, Brazil, Chile, Japan, Australia, and small European countries such as the Netherlands, Sweden, and Eastern European countries. The industrialization of these countries is enough to make industrially advanced countries lose sales of industrial products, i.e., lose international markets; (4) Implementation of "dumping" policies by various countries. The so-called dumping policy is to raise import tariffs on the one hand, making it difficult for foreign industrial and agricultural products to enter their domestic markets, and on the other hand, to dump products abroad at extremely low prices. Therefore, the implementation of dumping policies further shrinks international markets, and domestic consumption is weakened due to losses from product dumping; (5) High gold prices and low silver prices in recent years have caused great persecution to countries using the silver standard, even to the point of national bankruptcy, and the people's economic life has been plunged into extreme poverty, which is enough to sharply reduce consumption; (6) Various natural and man-made disasters have made the social economy even poorer; (7) Expansion of armaments in various countries has increased the burden of military expenditure on the people, making life even more difficult; (8) The exploitation of war debts. The above eight factors are interrelated and mutually causative, but they are all factors that have led to the current global recession. How can Hoover hope to save the world's economic downturn by deferring war debts and reparations for one year? However, the proposal of Mr. Hoover is probably the best of all the bad options.</p>
<p>Taking a step back and observing the current world economic situation, can deferring war debts and reparations for one year really provide relief to European countries? Even if they get a little relief within a year, there is no possibility of permanent prosperity.</p>
<p>Therefore, based on the facts, we can deduce that the outcome of Mr. Hoover's proposed chain of deferred payments will be (1) many setbacks in obtaining unanimous acceptance from debtor countries; (2) even if all countries accept and implement it, it will not save the world's economic downturn. We predict that the Washington government will subsequently convene disarmament conferences and silver price conferences to administer a second dose of medicine. If you don't believe it, just wait and see.</p>

<h3>Circular Letter from the Central Propaganda Department to Revolutionary Soldiers on Suppressing the Reds</h3>
<p>The Central Propaganda Department issued a circular letter on the 26th to revolutionary soldiers on suppressing the Red bandits. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Revolutionary soldiers, esteemed comrades, for years you have devoted yourselves to fighting for the cause and serving the revolution, your magnificent achievements occupy one of the most glorious pages in Chinese revolutionary history and will forever be praised and admired by the people. Since you possess this glorious history, you must think more about how to cherish and carry it forward. Now, as the Central Government intensifies its suppression of the Red bandits, we would like to mention a few points for your consideration:</p>
<p>Although the uprising of the Red bandits has been short-lived, the severity of their devastation is beyond description. The provinces of Jiangxi and Hubei are currently in deep water, with burning, killing, looting, and villages reduced to ruins. No one, whether women, children, or the elderly, is spared. Social organization has been destroyed, and national culture has been ruined. If we do not act now, the disaster of national subjugation and racial extinction will be imminent. This is our earnest hope that our revolutionary soldiers will eliminate violence for the people and kill bandits for the country (1).</p>
<p>The country has experienced many misfortunes in recent years, which has inevitably given the Red bandits an opportunity to grow. However, the main reason lies in the instigation and direction of Soviet Russia and the baiting and support of the Comintern. Therefore, a small spark will start a prairie fire. If we do not quickly extinguish it, not only will the new country of the Three Principles of the People, which our revolutionary soldiers have won with red blood, be shaken, but also the cultural system of our Chinese nation for thousands of years will be destroyed at the hands of Red imperialism. This is our earnest hope that our revolutionary soldiers will strive to sweep away the Red atmosphere and secure the country (2).</p>
<p>The usual tactics of the Red bandits are to rely on dangerous obstacles and make false claims. They escape and prolong their lives. Our revolutionary soldiers should, in the spirit of knowing ourselves and the enemy, thoroughly observe the terrain, clearly understand the details, and avoid being intimidated by false claims or being careless. We must be prudent and thorough, be courageous and decisive in the face of adversity, maintain close contact, and unite without懈怠. Then, the tactics of the Red bandits will be exhausted, and the success of victory will be achieved. This is our earnest hope that our revolutionary soldiers will encourage each other and achieve success (3).</p>
<p>Peaceful unification is the desire of the people of the whole country. Now, the Red bandits in Jiangxi and Hubei are being suppressed. Unexpectedly, the reactionary forces have risen again, not hesitating to undermine peace and promote enemies, isolating themselves from the people. Our revolutionary soldiers have always adhered to the principles and made great contributions. At this critical moment of national crisis and survival, you can deeply understand the distinction between following and opposing the tide and be entrusted with the responsibility of being a pillar of the country. This is our earnest hope that you soldiers will recognize the great cause, dedicate your lives to the country, and face difficulties (4). Eliminating the Red bandits and stabilizing society is an important resolution of this National Conference, and it is also the common demand of our people. Our Party regards saving the people as its mission, so the likes and dislikes of the people are the likes and dislikes of our Party, and the suffering of the people is the suffering of our Party. We share their joys and sorrows and share their existence. You soldiers eat the food of the people and receive orders from the Party. You must know that if the bandits exist, the people will die; if the people die, the Party will die. The bandits and the Party-state cannot coexist. You must love the people as you love the Party, and you must love the Party as you love the people. Currently, our Party is urging the government to intensify the suppression. We still hope that you will be loyal, courageous, and vigorously eliminate this menace, so as to alleviate the hidden worries of the Party-state and relieve the people's suffering. At present, the Red bandits in Jiangxi and Hubei are being surrounded and suppressed. In recent months, many have been killed. Now, the Central Government is mobilizing a large army to encircle them in a tight spot. Capture is imminent, and destroying their nests and annihilating the bandits only awaits the final effort. This is the time for you to make meritorious deeds and serve the country. We hope that you will rise up and strive for it.</p>
<h3>Incident of French Members Assaulting Chinese Members in the Sino-French Archaeological Expedition</h3>
<p>The Antiquities Preservation Committee Decides on Countermeasures</p>
<p>Liu Fu's Questioning of the French Embassy Counselor</p>
<p>Since the return of the two members, Diao and Hao, to Beijing to report on the French side's breach of contract and assault during the Sino-French 19 Academic Archaeological Expedition, the entire country has been extremely indignant. The Antiquities Preservation Committee (entrusted by the Chinese Academic Societies Association), which organized the expedition, held an emergency meeting and decided to investigate the French side's breach of contract and assault. During the investigation, all operations and work of the East and West teams were suspended, and the position of team leader of the Bu An team was suspended first. A telegram was sent to team leader Chu Minyi, ordering him to send a detailed report of everything to facilitate the second step of processing. Yesterday, the representative of Xinjiang stationed in Beijing also sent a telegram to the Xinjiang Provincial Government, requesting it to temporarily strictly prohibit the team's vehicles from entering the country and to provide full protection and assistance to the Chinese team members during their travels.</p>
<p>The French Embassy also paid close attention to the incident of the French team members' assault. A few days ago, the embassy counselor Han Dewei specifically issued a statement with some clarifications, roughly stating that since seeing the report in the newspaper, he had tried to send a telegram to the public to inquire about the truth, but had not yet received a reply, and the truth was still unknown. Moreover, Chinese team leader Chu Minyi also expressed that whether the circumstances were as reported in the newspaper needed to be investigated before a judgment could be made. Based on reasoning, it was inevitable that people from the two countries who did not speak the same language would make such a long journey. If the allegations were true, the embassy would definitely not want to be biased. As for the statement that Bu An was a military officer, because all French people had to serve in the army, which was slightly different from the situation in China, they were actually all scholars. There may be some misunderstanding on this point. The French Embassy also issued a statement on this matter, with wording similar to that of Han Dewei</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>The statement also denied that Bu An was a military officer. Liu Fu, a member of the Antiquities Preservation Committee, sent a letter to Han Dewei yesterday questioning what kind of scholar Bu An was. The original letter is as follows:</p>
<p>To Mr. Han Dewei:</p>
<p>Having read your statement in the newspapers, "As for the statement that Bu An was a military officer, because all French people have to serve in the army, which is slightly different from the situation in China, they are actually all scholars. There may be some misunderstanding," I deeply believe that a person in your position and who worships Christianity in the West would not commit one of the Ten Commandments and lie. I would like to raise two questions: (1) Since Bu An is not a military officer, why did he wear a military dress uniform at the official banquet at Sino-French University when he came to Beijing to negotiate in the summer of the 18th year, while all the other French people wore ordinary evening dress? (2) Since Bu An is "all scholars," what kind of science does he specialize in? From which university or specialized school did he graduate and what kind of degree or diploma did he obtain? In which school did he teach? In which academic institution did he serve? What works does he have and where were they published? Which famous academic societies invited him to be a member? I hope that you can clearly answer the above two points and publish them in the newspapers so that the public will not doubt your country's interpretation of the word "scholar" being "slightly different from the situation in China," which may lead to "some misunderstanding."</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Liu Fu</p>

<h3>The Truth About Tobacco Prohibition in Anhui Province</h3>
<p>Smokers Must Pay Fees to Register and Obtain Licenses</p>
<p>Merchants Must Pay Fees to Obtain Transportation Licenses</p>
<p>Bengbu Dispatch: After the establishment of the Anhui Tobacco Prohibition and Inspection Office, Director Hao Zihua immediately dispatched personnel to establish tobacco prohibition and inspection branch offices in important counties and towns by land and water. Because Hao also served as a seedling eradication committee member, he divided the tobacco-producing counties in Anhui Province into nine districts, assigning one inspection committee member to each district to specifically handle the inspection of tobacco seedlings. Each county was assigned a special commissioner, who in turn had inspectors and investigators to inspect tobacco seedlings and collect seedling taxes. The members assigned by Hao had all arrived in the counties to carry out work. Hao also arrived in Bengbu a few days ago and set up an office of the Anhui Tobacco Prohibition and Inspection Office in Tangyuan, the office in Bengbu. The decision was made to register the smoking households. It was reported that the regulation stipulated that each lamp would be charged a registration fee of four yuan and a license fee of several cents. For the transportation of opium, it was stipulated that each tael would be charged a transportation license fee and a voucher fee of a certain number of cents. After obtaining a transportation license and affixing a voucher, opium merchants could transport opium without hindrance and sell it openly. The so-called investigation and handling was nothing more than investigating and handling untaxed opium and opium merchants. Regarding the public sale of opium in Anhui Province, the Tobacco Prohibition and Inspection Office was drafting detailed regulations that would be promulgated and implemented soon. In order to ensure strict investigation and handling, the office stipulated that branch offices could be set up under the branch offices, and sub-stations could be set up under the branch offices. After the establishment of the Bengbu Tobacco Prohibition and Inspection Branch Office, the internal organization was ready to start work on the 22nd, first starting with investigating the opium dens and smoking households in the entire town in order to implement registration. During Yuan Lichen's handling of tobacco prohibition in the 17th year of the Republic, Bengbu Town received a minimum of 60,000 yuan per month in opium tax, and a maximum of 120,000 yuan. Now that the poppies in northern Anhui are being harvested in abundance, the opium tax revenue will definitely be considerable in the future. Counties in northern Anhui that produce opium have also set up tobacco prohibition and inspection branch offices one after another (June 24).</p>
<h3>Chen Tiaoyuan Passes Wuhu to Go to Northern Anhui</h3>
<p>To Return to the Province in About a Month</p>
<p>Wuhu Dispatch: The Red bandits in Anhui Province are wreaking havoc. In southern Anhui, the counties of Lang and Guang are the worst affected, while in northern Anhui, Liu'an is the most affected. Liu'an borders Henan Province, and over the years, many bandits have accumulated. The bandits in the nearby Mapu and Jinjia areas have occupied them as nests. Whenever the garrison troops are weak, they launch large-scale disturbances. The loss of life and property of the people in Liu'an is very serious. Last winter, the Red bandits colluded with the garrison troops to rebel, and the brigade commanders Chen Xiaosi and Chen Zhongfu died tragically. Recently, with the stationing of the 46th Division Yue Shengxuan's troops and the 5th Route Independent 5th Brigade Liang Guanying's troops, they have slightly restrained themselves. When Chairman Chiang went to Jiangxi to suppress the bandits, he originally intended to order the Commander of the General Reserve Army Corps, Chen Tiaoyuan, to accompany him and assist in the military operations. However, because the bandit gangs in Anhui Province should also be eliminated at the same time, Chairman Chiang sent a telegram to Chen from Wuhu, ordering him not to follow and to vigorously suppress the bandits in Anhui. Therefore, Chen decided to depart on the 24th to inspect and supervise the suppression of the Red bandits in Liuhe. When Chen passed through Wuhu, the heads of various agencies and leaders of various groups were waiting at the riverbank to welcome him. Chen's residence was set up at the Dongji Hotel. Therefore, the troops were stationed everywhere from Jiangkou to Zhongshan Road, and the security was very tight. Chen arrived at the No. 3 Company Wharf at 7:30 a.m. on the Anzhen warship. He immediately disembarked, met with the welcomers, and went straight to the Dongji Hotel to rest. In addition to the two companies of guards, those who followed him included Chief of Staff Li Erkang, Director of Staff Yao Maoxun, Adjutant Director and Head of the Public Relations Section Chen Guiting, Councilor Bai Junqing, and 24 staff adjutants. At 9:00, Chen, accompanied by Li Yao and others, went to the public stadium to inspect the artillery battalion of the 55th Division and the infantry of the 341st Regiment of the 57th Division, and delivered a speech. At noon, he attended the banquet of Yang Chunpu, a councilor of the headquarters. In the afternoon, he convened the heads of the military, police, and administrative agencies in Wuhu for a speech and gave instructions on everything. At 8:00 in the evening, he still took the Anzhen warship to set off, while the guards took the Rongchang small wheel to follow. It is estimated that after arriving in Chaoxian, he would stay for two hours to inspect the cavalry battalion of the 46th Division. In Hefei, there would be a delay of three or four days to inspect the Baixinshan troops of the 46th Division, and then go to Liu'an to inspect the divisions, inspect the defenses, and plan the suppression of the bandits. It is expected that he would return to the province in about a month.

<h3>Fujian Province Plans Bandit Suppression Funds</h3>
<p>Six Measures Decided</p>
<p>All Currently Underway</p>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: Due to the intrusion of the Red bandits in eastern Jiangxi into the counties of Jianning, Taining, Chongan, Guangze, Shaowu, and Jiangle in northern Fujian, the Fujian Provincial Government specifically established a Military Supplies Design Committee to plan bandit suppression funds. The cases decided by the committee have now been handed over to the Provincial Government for separate execution. Here is a record of them: (1) A 25% additional tax on salt, tobacco, and alcohol has been added. The Provincial Government has telegraphed Yang Shuzhuang in Shanghai to contact Song Ziwen nearby so that it can be levied as soon as possible; (2) A 25% bandit suppression fee is collected on imports and exports from the Fuzhou and Xiamen Customs. The Provincial Government has dispatched committee member Chen Peikun to contact the Fuzhou and Xiamen tax commissioners and the two general chambers of commerce. Negotiations in Fuzhou have already made progress, and Chen is scheduled to go to Xiamen to negotiate within days; (3) Borrowing US dollar bonds accumulated by the Minjiang River Dredging Bureau. According to the bureau's reply, the bonds have not yet reached the redemption period and cannot be discounted. Moreover, according to the contract signed with the consular corps by the former Provincial Governor's Office, dredging donations cannot be used for other purposes, so the Provincial Government should find other solutions; (4) Rent collection. The Provincial Government has decided in an ad hoc meeting that all counties in the province except for bandit areas will collect one month's rent, which will be paid by the tenants and deducted from the rent. The collection methods will be determined separately; (5) Issuance of the second phase of treasury notes for 500,000 yuan. After the first phase is completed, the situation will be assessed and a decision will be made on whether to proceed; (6) Half salary payment to staff in party and government agencies. This will be temporarily postponed due to special circumstances. However, the above items are all underway and have not yet begun to generate revenue. Moreover, the upstream Liu, Lin, Qian, Lu, and Zhou troops have telegraphed to urge for payment, which is extremely urgent, so the Finance Department is facing great difficulties (23rd).</p>
<p>Procedure for Land Consolidation in Jiangsu Province</p>
<h3>Sixty-One Counties in the Province to Be Organized in Six Phases</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Land Bureau previously drafted a table of procedures for land consolidation throughout Jiangsu Province and five principles and submitted them to the Provincial Government, requesting that the counties' land survey fees be collected on behalf of the government from the 20th year of the Republic (1931) onwards in accordance with established practice. The Finance, Construction, and Civil Affairs Departments jointly reviewed and replied to the Provincial Government, and the Provincial Government Committee decided to approve it. The table of procedures and principles for land consolidation throughout the province are extracted below:</p>
<p>(1) For the land consolidation of the 61 counties in Jiangsu Province, with the exception of Zhenjiang and Jiangning, which have already been opened for land surveys, the work will be carried out in six phases starting from the 20th year of the Republic (1931), one year at a time, to be completed uniformly by the 30th year (1941). Phase 1 (Year 20): Zhenjiang, Jiangning, Danyang, Wujin, Wuxi, Changshu, Wu County, Kunshan, Baoshan, Jiading, Shanghai, Fengxian, Chongming; Phase 2 (Year 21): Qidong, Chuansha, Jinshan, Nanhui, Qingpu, Songjiang, Taicang, Wujiang, Haimen, Nantong, Rugao; Phase 3 (Year 22): Yangzhong, Jiangpu, Liuhe, Gaochun, Lishui, Jurong, Liyang, Jintan, Yixing, Jiangyin; Phase 4 (Year 23): Jingjiang, Dongtai, Taixing, Taixian, Jiangdu, Yizheng, Gaoyou, Xinghua, Bao Ying, Yancheng, Funing; Phase 5 (Year 24): Huaian, Huaiyin, Siyang, Lianshui, Shuyang, Guanyun, Donghai, Ganyu; Phase 6 (Year 25): Suqian, Suining, Pixian, Tongshan, Xiaoxian, Fengxian, Peixian. (2) Each county will have a preparation period of six months for carrying out land consolidation, establish a county land bureau, and train land survey personnel. The completion period for the land survey should be estimated separately according to the size of each county's area and the condition of the land, and the longest period should not exceed six years. (3) Land registration in each county should be promoted in the area that has been surveyed one year after the land survey is opened, and should be carried out one year after the completion of the land survey. (4) The technical standards for carrying out land surveys and surveying and mapping general and sub-maps and books should be determined according to the needs of the facts and the deadline for land consolidation throughout the province. (5) The expenses for carrying out land surveys and surveying and mapping general and sub-maps and books should be determined according to the actual receipts of the provincial land survey donation and the budget limit should be determined. If there is a shortfall, the following three items may be allocated to assist: 1. Interest on the balance of the land survey donation; 2. Tax increase fee; 3. Surplus funds under the registration revenue item.</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>The Dark Side of Tao the Bandit Serving as a Detective: Tao Hulong, a pseudo-battalion commander under the lake bandit Taibao Ashu, was captured in Shanghai by the Su Provincial Water Public Security No. 1 District on the 14th of last month through a lead and escorted to Songjiang for interrogation, as reported in the previous news. Now it is known that Tao the bandit served as a water police inspector in Zhejiang Province four years ago and lived in Tao Zhuang Town, which belonged to Jia Shan County, for a long time. Therefore, he was very familiar with the situation in Jia Shan, Jiaxing, Pinghu, and other counties in Zhejiang Province. Most of the major kidnapping cases he committed were also in Zhejiang Province. He once robbed the Lin family in Tao Zhuang, the Xin, Zhen, and other places. There are countless other kidnapping and extortion cases. This spring, after the Songjiang, Jinshan, Jia Ping, and the four counties Bandit Suppression Command offered a reward for his arrest, Tao the bandit fled to Zhejiang in mid-March. He was once arrested by the Zhejiang Provincial Water Police, but the bandit was very resourceful and bribed Shen Yongshun (aka Shen Ahai) and Fei Jincai (aka Fei Yunxiang), who are now serving as detectives in the Zhejiang Water Police (it is said that Shen and Fei robbed Qianjiawei and He Hangzhen in Jinshan County on March 7 and June 2 of last year and fled to Zhejiang after being pursued by the Water Police and the No. 4 Anti-Smuggling Brigade). They had a good relationship with Tao the bandit and also persuaded Wang Deqing, the captain of the Zhejiang Water Police Patrol and Detective Team, to release him. They also changed his name to Tao Huansan and Wang Bao recommended him as a detective in the team. Therefore, when Tao the bandit was captured in Shanghai this time, a Tao Huansan detective symbol No. 131 of the Zhejiang Inland River Water Police Bureau and a document were found on him. It is said that the Bandit Suppression Command had heard rumors of this before Tao was captured and sent a letter to the Zhejiang Provincial Water Police to investigate, but the reply denied it, saying that the bandit was still arrested in Shanghai, which can be said to be the justice of heaven.</p>

<p>來函 Letter:</p>
<h3>無錫戴順志函 Letter from Dai Shunzhi of Wuxi:</h3>
<p>敬啟者 Respectfully Inform: In the Foreign News column of your newspaper on the 22nd, there was a report about a graduate of the police academy causing trouble and being detained, which is completely inconsistent with the facts. On that day, I and a friend were passing by the Bianmin Bridge in the south of the city when 江北 Jiangbei residents 虞同江 Yu Tongjiang and 徐必先 Xu Bixian were fighting. I stepped forward to persuade them, but they would not listen. The local police officers took the two men to the branch office for questioning and then transferred them to the court. This matter has nothing to do with me. Because I witnessed it at the time, I came forward to testify. After Prosecutor Du opened the court and investigated, he found that Yu Tongjiang was not injured and immediately ordered his release. It was not a graduate of the police academy who caused trouble, was detained, and released on bail. I believe the reporter misreported the facts. I am writing this letter specifically for correction and request that it be published in the Letters to the Editor column to clarify the truth. Dai Shunzhi, respectfully, 23rd.</p>

<h3>邱江雙打表演 Qiu Jiang Doubles Performance:</h3>
<p>日期尚未確定 The date is not yet confirmed. The Qiu Feihai and Jiang Daozhang doubles tennis performance was reported yesterday. We did not receive an official notice from the association last night, so it is likely to be postponed to next week.

<h3>Fierce Battle Between French and Japanese Doubles Teams</h3>
<p>The French team of Cochet and Brown aggressively attacked the center line in the first set, causing the Japanese team to fall behind 4-2, eventually losing 6-4. Brown often used drop shots to lure the Japanese players to the net. In the second set, the French team took a 2-0 lead, but the Japanese players suddenly rallied. Miki powerfully hit groundstrokes from the baseline, while Aoki volleyed and smashed at the net, tying the score at 8-8. However, Aoki was too careless, and the ball touched the net once, resulting in a loss of the second set. In the third set, Cochet's groundstrokes for the French team fully recovered, and the diagonal shots were extremely accurate. Brown, on the other hand, killed at the net, and when the score was 4-0, Aoki's kill at the net was very effective, winning three consecutive games, but they could not continue their victory and were eventually eliminated. Cochet used drop shots and corner shots to determine the outcome. The Japanese team attacked Cochet with all their might, but he had recovered to his original form.</p>

<h3>Wang Zhengting Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>To Attend the Polish Chargé d'Affaires' Banquet</p>
<p>Will Meet with Mr. Feetham This Morning</p>
<p>Remarks to Reporters Yesterday: Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting arrived in Shanghai by train from Nanjing yesterday afternoon at 5 PM. In the evening, he attended a grand banquet hosted by the Polish Chargé d'Affaires, Mr. Weidenthal, to celebrate the signing of the Sino-Polish Treaty of Amity and Commerce. Our reporter interviewed Foreign Minister Wang yesterday to inquire about recent diplomatic matters.</p>
<h3>Sino-American Legal Rights</h3>
<p>Mr. Wang replied: (1) Regarding the Sino-American legal rights negotiations in Nanjing, an agreement has been made with the American ambassador to begin negotiations once the negotiation documents are sent from Washington. The American ambassador is about to go north to escape the summer heat and is expected to come to Nanjing for negotiations in the near future. As for the selection of our country's ambassador to the United States, the Ministry is considering it carefully. All external rumors are untrue.</p>
<h3>Sino-Japanese Negotiations</h3>
<p>(2) Regarding the Sino-Japanese legal rights negotiations, he has met with the Japanese Chargé d'Affaires, Mr. Shigemitsu, in Nanjing several times and has made concrete progress. External rumors that the Japanese side may propose a new proposal are untrue. Mr. Shigemitsu returned to Shanghai this morning (i.e., yesterday morning). The date for continued talks has not yet been decided. As for the issue of the tax rate for the Fushun coal mine, our country will definitely not agree to the Japanese side's request for a reduction. Regarding the issue of Japanese fishing boats crossing the border to fish, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the Navy Department are jointly preparing the implementation of new regulations. Mr. Shigemitsu has repeatedly protested about this, but it concerns our country's sovereignty and cannot be relaxed in any way.</p>
<h3>Recovery of Concessions</h3>
<p>(3) Regarding the recovery of concessions, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs only issued notes to one or two relevant countries on the 22nd. The notes to the other countries are still being actively prepared. The date when the various countries will send representatives to Nanjing for formal consultations cannot be predicted until after the summer vacation, etc.</p>
<h3>Meeting with Feetham</h3>
<p>It is heard that Foreign Minister Wang will consult with Mr. Feetham, the advisor to the Public Works Department, regarding concession issues, as Mr. Feetham is scheduled to leave Shanghai and return to the Philippines on the 30th of this month. Mr. Wang is scheduled to meet with Mr. Feetham this morning and deliver an English speech at the graduation ceremony of St. John's University at 5 PM this afternoon. He will return to Nanjing tomorrow evening.</p>
<h3>French Radio Station Commercial News Case</h3>
<p>Negotiations Resolved After Ten Years: The French concession's Gujiazhai radio station was privately established by French entities and infringed upon our country's sovereignty. Our government has repeatedly protested and negotiated for more than ten years. It is now learned that the Ministry of Transportation has consulted with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate with the French ambassador. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has now replied in a letter, ordering the station to only use official telegrams and weather reports from June 15th of this year and not to send or receive any other telegrams. After the Ministry of Foreign Affairs replies, it will immediately consult with the Ministry of Transportation for verification and notify the local International Telegraph Office yesterday. It is also heard that all commercial telegrams between China and France and ship telegrams will be stopped by the station and will be directly transmitted by the Sassoon House Ministry of Transportation International Radio Station receiving and transmitting office through the International Radio Station and the Wusong Radio Station. The location of the receiving and transmitting office is suitable and should be faster.</p>
<h3>The Navy Special Party Department Requests the Recovery of Pilotage Rights</h3>
<p>A Case of Implementing National Orders</p>
<p>The Navy Special Party Department, which abolished self-governing orders, believes that pilotage rights are of great importance to maritime rights and maritime administration and should be recovered urgently. Therefore, it submitted a request to the Central Party Department's Executive Committee yesterday for handling. The request stated: "The issue of national territorial waters sovereignty is as important as territorial sovereignty, and among the various aspects of territorial waters rights, pilotage rights are the most important. There are three reasons for this. First, pilotage and guidance are the responsibility of the landowner and should be the exclusive business of our nationals. Second, pilots are responsible for leading foreign ships through the sea lanes into port fortresses, warning foreigners about photography and mapping, and preventing other types of reconnaissance. Third, if foreigners are free to act as pilots, they may be used by enemy countries in wartime. Based on these three points, no country in the world would entrust pilotage rights to foreigners. However, according to Article 2 of the pilotage regulations for various ports established by Hart, the Inspector General of Customs, during the sixth year of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty, 'Any Chinese citizen or citizen of a treaty country who wishes to serve as a pilot shall be permitted to do so equally.' At that time, the number of pilots in various ports of our country was reported by Hart to the Qing Dynasty Prime Minister's Office on September 10th of the seventh year of the Tongzhi reign, stating that there were a total of 203 pilots in various ports, including 103 Chinese, 6 Swedes, 2 Dutch, and 1 Austrian. This type of regulation was only implemented for one year, and foreigners already accounted for half of the number. Now, all pilots in various ports are foreigners, and their business licenses are issued by the customs. Moreover, there are many foreigners who privately act as pilots on the Yangtze River. Furthermore, during the Sino-French War in the eleventh year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, a French warship entered the Min River estuary, guided by an American pilot who was issued a license by our customs. This is recorded in Moore's International Law, and scholars of international law in various countries consider it a strange tale. At that time, the number of Chinese ships sunk and the number of people killed were so great that the country was humiliated and the army was defeated. This pilotage regulation was the main cause of this tragedy. Looking back on the past, we cannot help but tremble. The National Assembly passed a resolution to automatically abolish unequal treaties and resolutely recover all lost sovereignty. Pilotage rights are naturally among the rights that should be recovered quickly. Moreover, this regulation was originally a national order implemented by the Qing Dynasty and is not comparable to a treaty or agreement, so it can be cancelled at any time. We should immediately abolish the pilotage regulations of the sixth year of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty with a national order, stipulating that no one other than Chinese citizens may serve as pilots, so as to determine sovereignty and eliminate long-standing malpractices. This will be convenient for the party. We respectfully submit this request to the Executive Committee of the Central Committee, requesting that it be forwarded to the National Government to issue an order to abolish the pilotage regulations of the sixth year of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty, stipulating that no one other than Chinese citizens may serve as pilots, so as to determine sovereignty and eliminate long-standing malpractices. This will be convenient for the party. Respectfully submitted to the Executive Committee of the Central Committee."</p>
<h3>News Yesterday Regarding the Recovery of the Yangzi Wharf</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Transportation Sent Personnel to Shanghai to Handle the Matter</p>
<p>To Coordinate with the Shanghai Navigation Bureau in Recovering the Yangzi Wharf in Pudong: The Ministry of Transportation dispatched Commissioner Xu Shidan to Shanghai yesterday to coordinate with the Shanghai Navigation Bureau in handling the recovery of the Yangzi Wharf in Pudong. The reporter from China Eastern News Agency visited Mr. Xi Dingmo, the director of the Shanghai Navigation Bureau, at his private residence yesterday. Commissioner Xu, who was sent to Shanghai by the Ministry of Transportation, was also present. The interview was very detailed. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>History of the Wharf</h3>
<p>Mr. Xi and Mr. Xu stated that the Yangzi Wharf in Pudong was originally a German industry. Our country severed diplomatic relations with Germany in September of the sixth year of the Republic of China due to its participation in the European War and confiscated all of the wharf's assets. The following year (the seventh year of the Republic of China), the Ministry of Transportation leased the Yangzi Wharf, along with small steamboats and all office equipment, to the Japanese company Ocean Society. At that time, the rent was 700 taels per month, which was later increased to 1,400 taels.</p>
<h3>Accumulated Arrears Over the Years</h3>
<p>After the Japanese company Ocean Society leased the Yangzi Wharf in the seventh year of the Republic of China, it initially paid the rent on a monthly basis without any arrears. However, starting in July of the twelfth year of the Republic of China, it stopped paying rent until April of the twentieth year, accumulating a total of 135,600 taels in arrears.</p>
<h3>Coordinating Negotiations</h3>
<p>In order to protect property rights, the Ministry of Transportation cancelled its lease rights in accordance with the contract. Therefore, it has dispatched Mr. Xu to Shanghai to coordinate with the Shanghai Navigation Bureau in handling the matter. It has also posted a notice from the Ministry of Transportation at the Yangzi Wharf in Pudong, informing all Chinese and foreign ships that they are prohibited from berthing at the wharf.</p>
<h3>Reasons for Resisting Rent</h3>
<p>The reasons why the Ocean Society resisted paying rent are quite laughable. According to the Japanese side, the Hunan Mint owed the Japanese Showa Commercial Company 385,642 taels of copper in the sixth year of the Republic of China. According to the Ocean Society, the rent for the Yangzi Wharf should be deducted from this debt. This type of reason for resisting rent, which ignores laws and regulations, is truly unheard of. The Ministry of Finance did not approve the arrears for the copper owed by the former Hunan Mint at that time, so it cannot be valid. Moreover, the former Hunan Mint's debt to the Showa Commercial Company and the Ocean Society's debt to the Ministry of Transportation cannot be discussed together. An order has been received to negotiate, and efforts will be made to handle the matter.</p>
<h3>Japanese Stance</h3>
<p>The Japanese Vice Consul, Mr. Shirai Yasushi, stated that the Ocean Society had acquired the debt of the Japanese Showa Commercial Company. The former Hunan Mint and the current Ministry of Transportation are both Chinese institutions and should be deducted.</p>

<h3>News Yesterday After the Dissolution of the Wusong Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>The Social Bureau Ordered a Stop to Business Suspension</p>
<p>Zhang and Zheng Responded to the Social Bureau to Explain: The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce has been actively preparing for the establishment of a branch office since the Social and Public Security Bureaus jointly sent personnel to take over the Wusong Chamber of Commerce. It has been internally decided that the director of the future branch office will be Mr. Zhang Yuchi, the manager of the Wusong Wansheng Sauce Garden. Mr. Zhang was formerly a standing committee member of the Wusong Chamber of Commerce and enjoys a high reputation in the Wusong business community, so he is well-qualified for the position. The Social Bureau, having heard that businessmen in the Songzhen area were using business suspension as a form of passive resistance, ordered the former standing committee members of the Song Chamber of Commerce, Zhang Yuchi and Zheng Shushan, on the previous day to be responsible for persuasion and to prevent such actions in advance. After receiving the order, Zhang and Zheng submitted a response to the Social Bureau yesterday. The Social Bureau's order and the letter from the two standing committee members are transcribed below:</p>
<h3>Social Bureau Order</h3>
<p>Order No. 11611 to Zhang Zengjie and Zheng Shushan: Upon investigation, the former Wusong Chamber of Commerce has not been reorganized due to its defiance of laws and regulations. The former president of the chamber of commerce, Zheng Shushan, has also been accused of fraud. The Social and Public Security Bureaus have jointly taken over the chamber and ordered the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to organize a branch office as soon as possible to continue to take responsibility and properly clear things up. It is now found in today's newspapers that merchants in the area are using the excuse of business suspension to make demands. At a time when military operations are underway at the front, there is concern that some people may use this as an opportunity to incite chaos and disrupt public order. In addition to sending a letter to the Public Security Bureau ordering strict prevention in the area, this order is issued to the merchants to be responsible for persuasion and to prevent such actions in advance. Director of the Bureau, Pan Gongzhan.</p>
<h3>Zhang and Zheng's Response</h3>
<p>Report Regarding the Response: On the 24th of this month, we received Order No. 11611 from your bureau, which stated (omitted). Upon investigation, since the proposal to establish a branch office in Wusong was made, all the merchants in the town have been in an uproar. Initially, they asked that the order be revoked, and then they said that the matter was worth fighting for. Zengjie and others, as standing committee members, were caught in the middle. In fact, they have been working for many years and are inevitably exhausted. Their efforts to reduce the burden are only aimed at reducing their own burden. Once they are fortunate enough to receive the strict order to hand over the duties, they would gladly accept the responsibility even if they are reprimanded. However, there would be many obstacles within, and the criticism would lead to agitation and a mixture of people. For a moment, they felt that it was difficult to move forward or retreat. Zengjie and others tried to persuade them again and again, but they were unable to reach an agreement. Fortunately, the district officials helped them in many ways to prevent problems from arising. However, in the end, they were still responsible for petitioning to achieve their goals. Because of this, the district officials had already taken preventive measures before your Excellency's order, helping Zengjie and others to prevent problems from arising. As for the case in which Shushan was accused, Shushan had not heard of it before. On the 17th of this month, he suddenly saw the report in the newspaper. The plaintiff did not understand the truth and was being manipulated by others. He corrected it in the original newspaper on the 18th. When your committee came to the meeting, the questioning about this case was very detailed, and the original draft of the presentation to the province was taken back to be presented to your Excellency. As the previous reasons were ordered, they are now being inspected and sent for review together. Respectfully submitted to the Director of the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau, Pan Gongzhan. Submitted by Zhang Zengjie and Zheng Shushan, June 26th.</p>
<h3>The Provincial Government Urges the Collection of Business Tax</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government sent a telegram to the County Finance Bureau yesterday, which stated: "Director Wang, please review the case. Chairman Ye of the Provincial Government sent a telegram, which was also forwarded to the Nanhui County Magistrate for review. It is found that the business tax was resolved by this government to be implemented starting on April 1st. It is now found that Zhenjiang, Wuxi, and Changshu have already implemented the collection, while other counties are slow to handle the matter, which is a delay. The magistrates of the respective counties must earnestly supervise and urge that the implementation and reporting of the collection must be completed within a month. Provincial Chairman Ye. For this reason, in addition to forwarding the telegram, this telegram is sent to the Director of the Bureau for compliance and prompt handling, ensuring that the implementation and reporting of the collection must be completed within a month."</p>

<h3>The Anti-Opium Investigation Office was Established Yesterday</h3>
<p>A Letter to Military and Police Agencies for Verification: According to the Far East News Agency, the Anti-Opium Committee, based on the resolution of the Fifth Plenary Session to ban opium completely in six years and in accordance with Article 11 of the Implementing Law of the Anti-Opium Law, established anti-opium investigation offices in important provinces by land and sea to inspect opium transportation matters.

<h3>Cancellation of Tobacco and Alcohol License Collection Offices</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Stamped Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau, managed directly by the government, issued a special notice yesterday announcing the abolition of the collection offices in compliance with orders, stating: "Following the Finance Ministry's instruction No. 29724 (Yin Zi), regarding the request from the Tobacco and Alcohol Affairs Bureau for instructions, it was reported that the sudden abolition of commercial contracting and the change to commissioned management for the province's tobacco and alcohol collection offices presented practical difficulties. Permission was granted for a temporary tender commission system in the 18th year (of the Republic), and in the 19th year, revisions to the regulations and adjustments to the quota were approved for continued implementation. It is noted that the tender commission was originally a transitional expedient. Now that tobacco and alcohol taxation is undergoing active reorganization, all collection offices in the province should immediately abolish the tender method starting from the 20th year. The Bureau should carefully select capable personnel to take over the positions, thoroughly reforming the system to bring about improvements. Therefore, the Bureau is hereby instructed to promptly deliberate on specific measures and submit them for review and approval without delay. This instruction is to be followed accordingly." Upon receiving this, and after considering the situation and coordinating measures, a report was submitted to the Ministry, which approved the abolishment of all existing tobacco and alcohol monopoly fee, license tax, and other collection offices in the province starting from the 20th year. Instead, 32 monopoly collection sub-bureaus and 10 license tax collection sub-bureaus will be established and staffed with carefully selected personnel to directly collect taxes. These measures have already been implemented. In addition to printing and distributing notices to the various collection sub-bureaus for posting, a copy of the notice is enclosed for your association's reference and dissemination to all tobacco and alcohol merchant guilds for their information.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Baochuan Chongqi Taijia Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Collection Sub-bureau in Jiangsu had previously been managed by contractors. Recently, the Jiangsu Stamped Tobacco and Alcohol Bureau implemented a system of abolishing contractor management and switching to individual collection, appointing Gu Daosheng as the director of the Shanghai Baochuan Chongqi Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Collection Bureau, effective from July 1st. The main bureau remains in Shanghai, with a branch bureau in each of the other four counties. The Shanghai area's contractor-managed tax collection began in the 4th year of the Republic. In the 19th year, the five counties of Shanghai Baochuan Chongqi paid over 90,000 yuan to the Jiangsu province quota. It is rumored that after the change to individual collection, the tax revenue budget is expected to increase by 40%.</p>
<h3>Yang Shuzhuang's Illness Worsens</h3>
<p>No date set for trip to Fujian, nor to Hangzhou - Riri News reports that since Naval Minister Yang Shuzhuang arrived in Shanghai, he had planned to go to Fujian as soon as possible, but due to illness in his lungs, he is still receiving medical treatment and is unable to return to Fujian for the time being. Mr. Yang's condition had initially improved after diagnosis, but has recently worsened. Yesterday, he even coughed up blood, and doctors have ordered him to rest and avoid any further military affairs. Therefore, the date of his return to Fujian is still far off, and even the trip to Hangzhou has not been decided.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Council's Farewell to Mr. Feetham</h3>
<p>Yu Qiaqing gave an earnest speech. The two volumes of the report by Judge Feetham, advisor to the Shanghai Municipal Council, have been finalized. Mr. Feetham is scheduled to set sail for home on the 30th of this month. The directors and key staff of the Municipal Council hosted a farewell banquet for him at the Cathay Hotel on the Bund last night at 8:30 PM. Many speeches were given amid the clinking of glasses. The following is the farewell speech by Director Yu Qiaqing:</p>
<p>"Judge Feetham is a British legal scholar. His thinking, knowledge, talent, and experience are all admirable and convincing. The Municipal Council specially hired him to come to Shanghai to investigate, research, and seek solutions to the problems of the concessions, resulting in seven volumes of reports. The issue of the concessions, which has persisted for over eighty years, has been addressed by one person in a short period of time, determining its solutions. It is not realistic to expect perfection and unobstructed implementation, but it is indeed commendable that such a magnificent work has been produced in such a short period of half a year, which is admired by my colleagues and the people of our country. Tonight, the Municipal Council hosts a farewell banquet for Judge Feetham at the Cathay Hotel, and we are deeply honored to be the hosts. Looking back to the evening of February 12th last year, we held a farewell banquet for Mr. Collins here. Judge Feetham was present at that time. Time flies quickly, and it has already been seventeen months. The scenes and circumstances of today evoke feelings of both nostalgia and appreciation for the present moment. This is why the ancients would hold nighttime gatherings with candles. The chairman has asked me to offer a word to Judge Feetham, and I cannot refuse. I believe what I want to say is the same as what I said to Mr. Collins. However, I am moved by the fact that U.S. President Hoover issued a statement from the White House on the 20th of this month, advocating a one-year moratorium on war debts, which was greeted with thunderous applause around the world. The international market, which was on the verge of collapse, was instantly revitalized. One word is worth a thousand pounds. Britain has helped in the past, and France is following suit. Past misunderstandings have dissipated, and the cooperation of the world's people is enough to promote Sino-foreign cooperation in Shanghai. When Judge Feetham first came to Shanghai, he said that the prosperity of Shanghai lies in its sustainability. I would like to add to his meaning: it should also be for even greater progress. We can hope for the most recent step, that is, all of humanity should maintain the prosperity of the world and strive for even greater progress. However, to achieve this goal, we should pay attention to the following: in Shanghai, we should seek Sino-foreign cooperation without hindering sovereignty; in the world, we should seek human cooperation under the premise of national self-determination. If this is possible, a world of great harmony will not be far off. Farewell, Judge Feetham! Take care and cherish yourself. We colleagues will not fail to live up to the judge's expectations and make Shanghai's prosperity even more flourishing." Shanghai, June 26th, 20th year of the Republic of China, Yu Qiaqing</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Provincial Government's Inland Water Transportation to be Transferred to Commercial Operation</h3>
<p>The Department of Construction Stops Official Management</p>
<p>Zhang Jingpei takes over the Inland Water Merchants Steamship Bureau. The Inland Water Merchants Steamship Bureau is a giant in China's inland waterway transportation, with over 20 shipping lines and over 30 company-owned ships. Since last year, the Zhejiang Provincial Government has leased it to develop inland waterway transportation in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, with Chen Shuntong, Zhang Shusheng, and others appointed by the provincial government to manage it. After only half a year, the Zhejiang Provincial Government was reorganized, and Chen and Zhang resigned. The Department of Construction then appointed Shi Zhaoji to come to Shanghai to take over. Due to the financial constraints of Zhejiang's administration, the provincial government ordered the suspension of operations in May. Now, it is being transferred back to commercial operation, with Zhang Jingpei, a Shanghai shipping merchant, taking over the entire operation. The official handover will take place on July 1st. The details of this transfer from official to commercial operation are as follows:</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Province Stops Operation</h3>
<p>This spring, the Zhejiang Department of Construction appointed Shi Zhaoji to come to Shanghai to take over the bureau. Later, because the provincial government insisted on reducing administration and the business was incurring losses, Mr. Shi leased out the lines to other ports, leaving only the Shanghai-Hangzhou, Shanghai-Suzhou, and Shanghai-Huzhou lines under his own management. At the end of April, Shi requested 15,000 yuan from the provincial government for ship repairs and other purposes in order to reorganize shipping affairs. However, the request was rejected due to depleted treasury funds. Instead, he was ordered to lease out the Shanghai-Hangzhou lines as well and to dismiss all bureau staff, paying them one month's salary. The Inland Water Steamship Bureau would then cease operations. A few people would be left in Shanghai to manage rental matters. It is said that the entire lease could generate over 7,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Merchants Take Over</h3>
<p>Zhejiang had leased the Merchants Bureau for five years, but only one year had passed. After operations ceased in May, the Zhejiang Provincial Government decided to hold a tender and transfer operations to commercial management. The tender was held at the Department of Construction in Hangzhou. As a result, Zhang Jingpei, supervised by the Shanghai Inland Water Steamship Association, won the bid with an annual rental fee of 30,800 yuan. The Department of Construction sent a letter to Mr. Zhang, requesting him to pay a deposit of 20,000 yuan. At the same time, Shi Zhaoji was ordered to handle the handover. The lease term is four years. The official handover to commercial management will take place on July 1st, officially ending the official management.</p>
<h3>Commencement of Handover</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Director Shi ordered his subordinates to rush to prepare the handover inventory. The contractor, Zhang Jingpei, also came to Shanghai from Hangzhou after finalizing negotiations to take over the ships, docks, and other public property and equipment. The bureau staff will leave Shanghai and return to Hangzhou by the end of this month. Yesterday, the signs of the Zhejiang Provincial Government's leased Inland Water Merchants Bureau were removed. The new company must re-lease the ships leased out by Shi Zhaoji, which have terms of three to six months, on July 1st. A notice has already been sent out stating that the leases will not be renewed after expiration and that all operating ships must be handed over to the new director.</p>
<h3>Business Situation</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the reporter interviewed Mr. Zhang Jingpei to inquire about the business situation after the takeover. Mr. Zhang said that the Inland Water Merchants Bureau has a large scope of operations, but unfortunately, many ships are damaged. They must be heavily repaired before they can operate. Management equipment must also be improved. Mr. Zhang is also an important member of the Nantong Dasheng Company and is very familiar with the captains of the various inland water steamships. In the future, the Zhejiang Provincial Government will provide more convenience to the shipping affairs of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. He is very confident about the future of the business.</p>
<h3>Shipping News Highlights</h3>
<p>Developing Upstream Navigation. The Shanghai Sanbei Company received a telegram from the upper Yangtze River stating that the direct Shanghai-Chongqing ships had previously been opposed by the lighterage workers of Yichang, who did not allow them to operate. Now, the upstream shipping industry has decided to lift the ban, and Shanghai-Chongqing ships can now be opened. The company will send the Fuyang ship, which was being withdrawn to Shanghai, to operate on the Shanghai-Chongqing line. The Nichi-Shin's Jijiang is also transferring ships from Yichang to Shanghai to compete for the Chongqing cargo. Once this is opened, Shanghai will have countless more Chongqing-bound ships. In order to consolidate the upper Yangtze River shipping industry, the Sanbei Company has specially purchased land in Yichang and Chongqing to build docks. Ren Ziqing has been appointed to go to Yichang and Chongqing on Monday to carry out the construction.</p>
<h3>Yangtze River Steamships Resume Service</h3>
<p>The Yangtze River steamships of the Chinese Merchants Steam Navigation Company, which had been suspended for a long time, are now gradually resuming service. After the first ship, the Jiang'an, arrived in Shanghai, the Sanbei Changxing also resumed service yesterday. It is said that most of the remaining ships are docked in Hankou and Xunyang and can resume service within a week.</p>
<h3>Butchers' Strike Resolved</h3>
<p>Fresh meat will be available on the market today. Due to the compulsory purchase of fresh pigs by butcher Zhang Xiaogen from the Changyuan and other fresh pig businesses in Shanghai, a major disturbance occurred. As a result, most stores sold overnight meat the day before yesterday. Yesterday, both parties reached an understanding, and the butchers resumed work. The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Court Interrogation</h3>
<p>The case of the conflict between Liang Anmin, an employee of Changyuan Pig Company, and Zhang Xiaogen, a butcher of Wanxingxing, was transferred to the District Court by the First Branch of the First District of the Public Security Bureau. The butcher Zhang Xiaogen was immediately released after questioning. The employee Liang Anmin was also released by the District Court yesterday morning around 10 o'clock.</p>
<h3>Butchers Resume Work</h3>
<p>Over a thousand butchers from the Suxi Slaughterhouse on Xinzha Road, Ninghai Slaughterhouse, Yuezhou Road Juxing Slaughterhouse, Zhabei Shenghe Slaughterhouse, Xuejiabang City Slaughterhouse, the French Municipal Council Slaughterhouse, and the Jiaxing Road Renyuan Slaughterhouse, all resumed work yesterday morning. They went to the Xuejiabang Fresh Pig Market as usual to load pigs and butcher them. Because of the butchers' strike, there was a panic among the fresh meat merchants who feared there would be no meat for sale. Yesterday, it was heard that the butchers and pig businesses had reached a settlement, and they all rushed to the market to purchase goods. The meat sold on the market today is all fresh meat.</p>
<h3>Resolution Method</h3>
<p>After the butchers' strike, Wang Wenkui was entrusted to negotiate with Gu Baoxin, Wang Rongqing, and other representatives of the pig businesses in the Changshun Pig Company in Yong'an Lane, Shiliupu, at 8 PM on the 25th. In order to maintain the original relationship between the two parties, they reached a mutual understanding: (1) The butchers will resume work on the 26th. (2) Both parties will prepare a document to submit to the District Court requesting the withdrawal of the case. The employee Liang Anmin will accept the advice of both parties and will not pursue the matter. All employees will also open the scales and transport goods as usual.</p>

All the Chinese directors agreed to provide assistance.</p>
<h3>Reply to the Municipal Council</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Municipal Council sent a letter to the National Products Department Store stating that it was completely unaware of the entertainment equipment mentioned in the letter. The reply to the Municipal Council stated: "Dear Sirs, We were surprised to receive your letter No. 1121 yesterday, which mentioned various matters from your letter of January 13th. As this department store was taken over from the New World on May 1st, we are completely unaware of the various matters mentioned in your letter of January 13th and are unable to reply.

Your department store's telegram requesting the central government to seriously protest and abolish consular jurisdiction until the goal is achieved is unanimously supported by the people of Shaanxi Province, and we will provide practical assistance as a diplomatic backing. We are sending this telegram in reply. Please take note."</p>

<h3>Finance Minister Song is in Shanghai Negotiating Unified Tax Public Bonds</h3>
<p>Advising Banks to Purchase and Sell as Much as Possible. The Ministry of Finance, due to the government's urgent need for funds, has reissued 80 million yuan in unified tax public bonds last month. The National Government has issued a decree for their issuance. So far, after more than a month, in addition to the Central Bank and Bank of Communications, which have already purchased several million yuan each, other banks have also purchased a portion. It is reported that Finance Minister Song Ziwen came to Shanghai from Beijing a few days ago and has been negotiating with the banks about the unified tax public bonds, asking them to purchase and sell as much as possible.</p>
<h3>Progress of Revising the Sino-Japanese Agreement</h3>
<p>Steps for Discussion Have Been Decided. The Chinese National Goods Maintenance Association, due to the many inequalities in the Sino-Japanese Agreement, has received an order from the Ministry to convene various industrial groups to discuss and research amendments. The committee for the study of Sino-Japanese agreement tax rates will soon be formally established. The recent progress is recorded separately below:</p>
<h3>Discussion Steps</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter from the New Voice News visited Wang Jianan, a standing committee member of the Chinese National Goods Maintenance Association, to inquire about the methods for studying and revising the Sino-Japanese agreement. Wang said that the main Chinese goods transported to Korea are silks, summer cloth, and embroidered goods. Silk amounts to more than 10 million yuan annually, summer cloth about 6 million yuan, and embroidery about 1 million yuan. The tax rate is generally 70% of the value. Japanese goods transported to China include cotton goods, fish, seafood, wheat flour, and miscellaneous goods. The tax rate is generally 8% of the value, making it difficult for Chinese goods to be sold in Japan and easy for Japanese goods to be sold in China, which is obviously unequal. The steps for discussing and revising the Sino-Japanese agreement are: (1) Organize a research committee; (2) Submit all proposals to the committee for research; (3) Convene a general meeting to pass them; (4) Send them to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for adoption. After the committee is formally established, request the Ministry to instruct all industries in the provinces related to the Sino-Japanese agreement to conduct research.</p>
<h3>Circular to Various Industries</h3>
<p>The Chinese National Goods Maintenance Association sent a letter to various industrial groups, national goods factories, and industry associations yesterday to organize the Sino-Japanese Agreement Research Committee, stating: "Dear Sirs, Our association believes that the various clauses of the Sino-Japanese Agreement, such as the Jia and Yi tables, are obviously not in line with the principle of equality and mutual benefit, resulting in the fact that our Chinese goods are still disappearing from Japanese sales to this day. We should publicly discuss and carefully study and amend the articles within the period specified in the agreement and submit them to the Ministry for adoption. After our association telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the Yang day of May to request a new agreement, we received a reply requesting us to convene relevant groups to study and submit them to the Ministry for consultation with the Ministries of Finance and Industry for review. We have decided to convene a joint meeting of various groups and have decided to designate the representative's name, age, origin, occupation, and address within one week and report them to the association for notification. Please inform your association to investigate and quickly elect a representative to report in a letter so that we can schedule a meeting of all members to decide on all matters that should be done, so as not to delay and benefit the people's livelihood. We are very grateful."</p>
<h3>Expansion of the National Goods Exhibition Hall</h3>
<p>Planning to Consolidate the Foundation of Foreign Trade. Since the Shanghai National Goods Exhibition Hall moved to 67 Zhonghua Road, it has greatly expanded its interior. Recently, domestic and foreign chambers of commerce have been sending letters and telegrams to the hall requesting investigations of national goods. Now, in order to facilitate responding to requests for investigation from all over, the hall is replacing all the old exhibits with new ones and plans to select 100 domestic manufacturers of high-quality national products to replace and display exhibits in the following categories: (1) Agriculture and Forestry, (2) Mineral Products, (3) Dyeing and Weaving Industry, (4) Chemical Industry, (5) Machine Manufacturing, (6) Handicrafts, (7) Educational Supplies, (8) Art, (9) Food and Beverage, (10) Medicine, (11) Industrial Raw Materials. Each category will have ten selected products as samples of domestic national products for introduction to overseas Chinese and to consolidate the foundation of foreign trade, so that the people of the country will not be blindly indifferent. The hall has been planning and implementing this for several days. From July 1st, staff will be sent to conduct preliminary investigations and collect samples for strict screening.</p>
<h3>Corpse of German Advisor Buck to be Transported to Shanghai Today</h3>

<h3>The Second District Party Headquarters of Shanghai County Prevents Local Tyrants from Engaging in Activities in Township Elections</h3>
<p>The Second District Party Headquarters of Shanghai County sent a letter to the First District Office, stating: "Dear Sirs, We have investigated the documents transferred from the Second District Party Headquarters and found that Liu Junfu of Huajing Town extorted money from villager Chen Xinlou. Although the District Court did not convict Liu Junfu, the Higher Court's disposition stated that 'Chen Xinlou's accusation that Liu Junfu extorted donations is not without reason,' which clearly shows that Liu Junfu did engage in extortion. This time, when conducting township elections and investigating candidates, your district office did not include Liu Junfu, which is commendable. It is heard that Liu Junfu is trying everything possible to be supported by someone powerful to have the County Government order your district office to include Liu Junfu in the list of candidates in order to compete for the position of town chief. If he succeeds, the good people there will suffer unspeakably. Our association, standing on the Party's position to eliminate local tyrants and relieve the people's suffering, cannot sit idly by. In addition to ordering the Fourth Sub-division to investigate and report, we are hereby sending a letter to your district chief, hoping that you will not fear the strong or be tempted by profit and will persist to the end. Our association will support your district chief with all the Party members in the district." To Peng, the District Chief of the Second District.</p>

<h3>The Will of Hui Ling Student Lan Jianye</h3>
<p>Regretting Being a Mediocre Person</p>
<p>Wasting Society's Grain</p>
<p>Therefore, He Committed Suicide to Preserve Purity and Withdraw</p>
<p>This Gentleman Seems to Have a Mental Illness. Lan Jianye, a graduating student of the Hui Ling English School of Specialization in Xinlonghua, Southwest of Shanghai, committed suicide on the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway near the school at around 8 a.m. the other day. The details were reported yesterday. It is now known that before his death, the student asked the principal for his diploma and money. The principal explained that the graduation diploma had to be stamped by the Provincial Department of Education before it could be issued. When the student urged him repeatedly, the principal issued a temporary receipt to Lan, to be exchanged for the official diploma later. Lan was extremely happy to receive the temporary receipt, believing that his lifelong wish had been fulfilled and that he could console his elderly mother at home. Therefore, the other morning, he went to the railway track behind the school alone and committed suicide. After the incident, the principal went to the student's dormitory at No. 303 and found five letters and many photos of the student in his book chest. One letter was addressed to the principal, two to his elderly mother at home, one to his fellow villagers Shi Shuangchun and Guo Liulin (students at Jinan University), and another with only the character "Cause" written on it. According to its content, the general idea was that he was mediocre and incapable of benefiting society, wasting society's grain, so he preserved his purity and withdrew to avoid blocking the path of the wise. The original letter is transcribed below: Not being a pioneer or a follower, and unwilling to be ignorant, this is why I lament my life, hate my life, and end my life. Since Heaven gave me life, I should repay it. If I cannot bring glory to the country, at least I should bring honor to my family. If I cannot bring glory to the country or honor to my family, and I am a mediocre, incapable, and parasitic member of society, I cannot bear to be a burden to society, which is already overpopulated. If the production volume remains the same and the mediocre are not eliminated, how can the wise and talented survive? If the mediocre cannot benefit society, why not preserve their purity and withdraw to avoid blocking the path of the wise and benefiting society? My father was unfortunate to have given birth to me, a mediocre and incapable person. I have an incurable hereditary disease. I lament my life and mourn my death. If I am reborn, I will only waste society's grain and occupy a position in society. Moreover, I am unwilling to live for the sake of living. This is what I lament about my life. My death will only hurt my feelings. I have an elderly mother who loves me the most because I am a posthumous child. When she hears the bad news, I don't know how much she will grieve. I love my mother the most. How can I not be moved by her grief? I should tell my friends to tell my mother that my death was due to illness, that Heaven was unkind and took away her beloved son. Perhaps this will reduce her sadness. Alas, I cannot die in peace.</p>
<p>Mother, Under Your Knees: I have received one hundred Shanghai dollars and hereby inform you to comfort your loving thoughts. I have now graduated from the senior high school program at this school and originally intended to enter university next semester to pursue further studies, but I do not know which university will accept me. I will send you a special letter after I am accepted. I will also send the senior high school diploma after I enter university. I wish you peace. Your son, Jianye, respectfully bows. 20.6.22</p>
<p>To Mr. Principal: I am committing suicide for a special reason. I hope you will grant my request and inform my family of this news accurately. Do not say that I committed suicide, but only say that I died of illness. As for the graduation diploma, please send it back to my home by registered mail. Student Lan Jianye respectfully bows. The letters to Shi and Guo are roughly the same, so they are omitted.</p>
<h3>Bride Elopes Before Wedding</h3>
<p>The Groom's Family Failed to Fulfill the Conditions</p>
<p>The Bride Seized the Opportunity to Escape Back to Taicang. Yang Shouquan, a 27-year-old from Taicang, who lives at No. 46, a villa on Wanjing'an Temple Road, recently engaged Gu Wenkui, a matchmaker, and a woman named A'er to arrange a marriage with Su Jinmei, the daughter of Su A'mao, who lives behind the Huayuan Stone Bridge in Pudong. Jinmei is 17 years old and somewhat pretty. At the time, it was agreed that the betrothal gift would be 150 yuan, four pieces of gold jewelry, and eight sets of clothes. The engagement date was set for the 12th of this month. However, the matchmaker only delivered 60 yuan of the betrothal gift, only one plain gold bracelet, and no clothes. The wedding date was set for 6 p.m. on the 24th of this month at the Lin'an Hotel on Wuma Road. The bride's family believed that the groom's family had not delivered the full amount of the betrothal gift, gold jewelry, and clothes, and had violated the marriage agreement. Therefore, they negotiated with the original matchmaker. On the evening of the 23rd, the two matchmakers delivered another 75 yuan, leaving a shortage of 15 yuan. The missing gold jewelry and clothes were not replenished. The bride had no choice but to swallow her anger. The next day (the 24th) was the auspicious day. The groom's family had not prepared any of the usual wedding customs such as the sedan chair. At the appointed time, they hired a car to wait by the Jiangbian in Puxi. The bride, dressed in plain clothes, followed the matchmaker across the river and got out of the car in front of the hotel. Seeing that there were no lanterns or silk decorations at the entrance, she reluctantly entered the room opened by the groom's family to wait for the wedding. However, the bride believed that marriage only happens once in a lifetime. It was acceptable not to ride in a sedan chair, but it was unacceptable not to wear a wedding dress. Therefore, she asked the matchmaker to demand that the groom's family prepare a new-style wedding dress and a veil, and vowed not to follow the old-fashioned kneeling ceremony. However, the groom's family refused all of her requests. The bride also learned that the groom already had a wife, but she was suffering from a mental illness. Since she would be in the position of a concubine, she would inevitably suffer after entering the family. Therefore, she pretended that it was very hot inside and asked to go to the entrance for some air. In a split second, she slipped out of the hotel and escaped back to her home in Pudong, declaring that she would rather die than marry someone with the surname Yang. After the bride disappeared, the wedding turned into a laughing stock. The groom cried out in dismay. In addition to sending people to track her down to the bride's family to negotiate, he also paid all the expenses after the guests finished their meal and went home in a huff. The other day, he went to the Pudong Third District Public Security Bureau to file a complaint, accusing the original matchmaker of setting up a scam and releasing the bride. He requested that they be severely investigated and dealt with. The district chief approved the request and sent police to investigate the original matchmaker Gu Wenkui and A'er, as well as the bride Jinmei's parents. Yesterday, Jinmei arrived at the station on time, but the plaintiff and the matchmaker's witnesses had not yet arrived. Further summons will be issued when all the witnesses are present for questioning.</p>
<h3>Huang Shimin Commits Suicide Due to Frustration in Love</h3>
<p>A Letter to Ma Shijuan</p>
<p>Its Content is Extremely Tragic. Yesterday afternoon at 4 p.m., a young man, about 30 years old, wearing a blue striped shirt, black gauze pants, white socks, and silk shoes, claiming to be named Huang Shimin, went to the Beizhan Hotel on North Zhejiang Road to ask for a room. The hotel receptionist noticed that he looked different and politely refused. However, he said that he had been playing mahjong for three days and nights and asked for a night's lodging. The hotel staff, half-suspecting, had no choice but to grant his request and instructed the porter to lead him to Room 34 upstairs. He paid the room fee of six dimes and six cents on the spot and instructed the porter to check on him from time to time to see what was going on. At first, they saw him writing with his head buried in his hands, looking very sad. At around 6 p.m., Huang's toxicity exploded, and he vomited white foam. The porter reported to the accounting office, and they sent him to Tongren Hospital for treatment in a car. After arriving at the hospital, the doctor diagnosed that he had taken sleeping pills. Although they tried their best to give him injections and gastric lavage, the overdose was too much, and his life was in danger. His farewell letter is found below: The envelope is addressed to: Ma Shijuan, Ma Baoji Bookstore, Zhabei. Inside it reads: To my dear sister, Ma Shijuan: I think we have known each other for more than two years, and our love has reached a boiling point. I admire my dear sister's knowledge and character very much. How passionate our feelings were at the beginning! Now it is the opposite. Looking back on the past, how can I not feel reluctant? I am just a poor scholar, abandoned and despised by others. However, I have fulfilled my obligations to you. I have given you no less than several hundred yuan, which is not much, but not little. Now that I am rejected by your mother and daughter, I can rest. However, your mother and daughter can kill people without knives. Their hearts are so poisonous that it is frightening. I am saying goodbye to you forever. Take care. Handwritten by Huang Shimin. In summary, Huang's suicide was due to frustration in love.</p>
<h3>Foreman Extorting Money</h3>
<p>Construction Site Owner Unable to Endure the Harassment</p>
<p>Filing a Lawsuit and Being Released on Bail. Pan Shouren, who lives at No. 641, Avni Road, is engaged in construction and also owns the Panyi Tai Rice Store in Huxi, making him a relatively wealthy man. Previously, Pan reported to the Xinzha Patrol Room that Muo Shoushan, a foreman from Qingjiang, had repeatedly threatened him in an attempt to extort $15,000. Patrol head Che Xueceng was dispatched to investigate and arrested Muo Shoushan at his home at No. 648 Gordon Road at 5:30 a.m. the other day. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Special District Court, where Judge Ge opened the court and summoned witnesses for questioning. First, Patrol Room lawyer Wang Yaotang stated the cause of the case, saying that Pan's nephew, Hong Yuandi, was kidnapped by bandits in July of the 16th year of the Republic of China and a huge ransom was demanded. Muo devised a plan to find out the bandits' den and the location where the hostage was hidden and reported it to the Patrol Room, who rescued Pan's nephew and arrested the bandits, who were interrogated and punished. Afterwards, Muo, relying on his merit, repeatedly demanded money from Pan. Over the years, Pan had given him no less than $3,000 or $4,000, but Muo was still insatiable. On the evening of the 22nd of this month, he went to Pan's house again to demand $15,000, demanding payment within three days, otherwise he would take unfavorable action against Pan. Pan then filed a complaint, and so on. Then, Pan Shouren stated that recently, when the defendant came to my house, he always came with his mother and wife, and I always gave them money and politely persuaded them to leave. But on the 22nd, the defendant claimed that because he had solved the case of your nephew's kidnapping, he had been hated by the bandits and had been unable to work outside for five years, causing huge losses. He asked for $3,000 per year, totaling $15,000. If you don't agree, don't blame me for taking unfavorable action against you. I felt that his words were threatening, so I reported it to the Patrol Room. Defendant's lawyer Fan Gang questioned Pan a few times, and then Pan's accountant Xi Huanzhang and Yang Bu'an and others were successively called to the stand to testify. Finally, Judge Ge questioned the defendant Muo Shoushan, who stated that I work as a small contractor and Pan works as a large contractor, and we often have business dealings. Last year, I subcontracted from Pan 3,692 cubic feet of sand and soil from the 13th factory of the Japanese company, at a price of $2.60 per cubic foot. When settling the accounts, Pan only calculated 1,990 cubic feet, a huge difference. When asked to weigh it, he also shirked his responsibility and changed the price to over $3,000. In addition, he still owed me over $5,000, which I repeatedly demanded but he ignored. In April, I filed a complaint with the Bureau of Social Affairs, but the Bureau believed that this case was not a labor dispute and refused to accept it, ordering me to file a lawsuit in court. Just as I was about to proceed, Pan suddenly accused me of owing him $880 for rice and $300 for loans, which have not yet been concluded. Now he is accusing me of extortion. Please investigate. The judge, believing that further investigation was needed, ordered the defendant to pay a deposit of $2,000 and adjourned the hearing to July 7.</p>
<h3>Wife of the Township Head of Yowo Sand Escapes Danger</h3>
<p>$1,350 Ransom. Zhou, the wife of Wang Shiming, the township head of Yowo Sand outside Wusongkou, was kidnapped in mid-May because the bandits' attempt to kidnap Gu Qingfeng, a grain household in the area, failed. The bandits mistakenly identified Zhou as Gu's wife and kidnapped her. Details were previously reported in this newspaper. It is now known that Zhou's family prepared $1,350 and went to the bandit den at the Da'an Port in Beisha the other day to ransom her. She has now escaped danger and returned home. According to her, after being kidnapped, the bandit ship sailed to Da'an Port and was then hidden in a thatched hut on the beach in a certain harbor near Santiao Port. The bandit den was a simple shack with three rooms. The area was quite desolate. Since being kidnapped, she has been held for 37 days. Two or three bandits took turns guarding her and were beaten once every two or three days. When they beat her, the bandits often said, "Why has no one come to redeem you?" Therefore, it was extremely difficult to endure. The family prepared money to redeem her. However, the bandits were a small group of just over 30 people, with over 20 long and short guns. They were not connected to the larger groups such as Pan Kaiwu and others, so their power was not great and their situation was very poor.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Strictly Bans Cheng Xun from Spreading Demagoguery</h3>
<p>Cheng Xun, a villager in Jiangwan, falsely claimed that Liu Zhongxian, the Dongyue Temple, had possessed him and set up a spirit writing altar to spread demagoguery. The municipal party department believed that such an event should not be allowed under a revolutionary government and immediately sent a letter to the municipal government to severely ban it. The municipal government ordered the social affairs and public security bureaus and the Jiangwan municipal affairs committee to thoroughly investigate it for verification and action. The third division of the Bureau of Social Affairs has completed its investigation and determined that Cheng Xun's demagoguery does require strict investigation and banning. It immediately reported back to the municipal government, advocating for deportation and temporarily guarding the Dongyue Temple. The municipal government has approved the request and ordered the Jiangwan municipal affairs committee and the Public Security Bureau to severely ban it immediately and to send police to guard the Dongyue Temple.</p>

The committee is now rushing to complete its internal work and is extremely busy. It is expected to complete all of it within this week.</p>

<h3>Tenants of Yuxingfang Oppose Demolition</h3>
<p>The Real Estate Department of the Dibek Lawyers recently sent letters to the tenants of Yuxingfang on Father Rhodes Road stating that the houses are old, dilapidated, and the land price is high. The market is booming and the buildings will be completely renovated. They were asked to move out before the barricades are erected on August 1. The tenants replied with a letter stating that the houses in the neighborhood were built seven years ago and cannot be considered old. The style is much higher than shacks and cannot be considered dilapidated. Regardless of whether the high land price is caused by speculators or outsiders, the calculation should still be based on the time the house was built, unless it is sold. The only valuation is found in the Municipal Council's valuation book. Regardless of whether the booming market is due to the tenants and the public, the fact is that the population is larger. The true prosperity of the market is still out of reach. They wrote back to the rental office asking them to withdraw the decision.</p>

He had been staying in Room 20 of the hotel since April 11. He usually lived in seclusion and occasionally showed signs of unhappiness. Due to economic hardship, he suddenly had thoughts of death. The other night at around 7 p.m., he secretly took poison and committed suicide. The porter discovered him and sent him to Renji Hospital for treatment in a car. However, the poison had entered his internal organs, and the medical treatment was ineffective. He died at 8:20 p.m. yesterday. The hospital reported the matter to the Fourth Road General Patrol Room, and police were ordered to investigate. An examination of the body was carried out at the morgue, pending a court examination. Afterwards, reporters went to the China Hotel to investigate and learned that there were still two suitcases, a rattan basket, a small leather wallet, and a watch in Ni's room, as well as some scattered items. According to the hotel staff, Ni had only owed about seven yuan for several months. It was learned that his father-in-law, Mr. Huang, worked at the Xietai Soy and Rice Shop in Langjiaqiao, Dou City Street, Nanshi, and his cousin, Chen Songshou, currently works at the Yinfeng Foreign Goods Store in Ruiqingfang, North Wuxi Road. Servants were sent to inform them.</p>
<h3>Zhu Sen Owns Two Daughters Result</h3>
<p>Sentenced to One Year of Imprisonment</p>
<p>Xu Zhaodi Sentenced to Six Months. Zhu Sen, a merchant from Anhui working at the Hexing Foreign Goods Store at No. 930 Wuchang Road, had been having an affair with his neighbor, Xu Zhaodi, a woman from Ningbo, for some time. Recently, Zhaodi's parents arranged for her to marry someone else, so Zhaodi introduced her close friend, Tang Xiulin, the daughter of Tang Baoshan, the owner of the Victory Biscuit and Candy Store, to Zhu. She even acted as a matchmaker, suggesting that Tang give his daughter to Zhu as his wife. After Tang refused, Xiulin secretly eloped like Hongfu, and Zhaodi also went to join them. Zhu then fulfilled his desire of having both women. Unfortunately, it was very brief, lasting only one night before Tang reported him, and they were arrested and detained. Details have been previously reported. Yesterday morning, the case was sentenced. The police escorted Zhu and the others to court. Tang Baoshan also attended with his representative lawyer, Fan Gang. Judge Feng Shide ascended the bench, questioned the defendants briefly, and then announced the verdict: Zhu Sen was sentenced to one year of imprisonment for intending to commit adultery and enticing a woman under the age of twenty to leave the custody of her parents. Xu Zhaodi was sentenced to six months of imprisonment for assisting in the intention to commit adultery and enticing a woman under the age of twenty to leave the custody of her parents. Tang Xiulin was acquitted and taken back by her parents for discipline. After the sentencing, the defendant's representative lawyer stated that the defendants were not satisfied with the verdict and would appeal. The judge naturally approved the appeal. The final result still awaits the judgment of the appellate court.</p>
<h3>Syphilis After Cohabitation</h3>
<p>Jiang Junmin and Yu Jiuxiang Jiang Junmin, who is currently working as a clerk at a certain law firm, has a relative living at No. 163 Nanyang Lane, North Zhejiang Road, in the British Concession. Therefore, Jiang often visits. A woman named Yu Jiuxiang, 23 years old from Ningbo, lives upstairs. Yu's husband passed away three years ago, and she lives alone in her room. She also occasionally comes downstairs to socialize. Jiang saw her with her lightly painted eyebrows and inner and outer beauty, and he flirted with her. Eventually, they fell in love and started living together for two weeks. Recently, Jiuxiang suddenly contracted syphilis, causing her period to be delayed. She asked Jiang to hire a doctor to diagnose and treat her. Jiang not only refused to hire a doctor but also infected Jiuxiang with syphilis. Jiuxiang, having been widowed for three years, knew that everyone knew about their cohabitation. If not for Jiang's transmission, where would the disease come from? Therefore, filled with anger, Jiuxiang suddenly went to Jiang's office yesterday around 10 a.m. and started quarreling endlessly. Jiang, annoyed by Jiuxiang's disturbance in the office, reported to the Haining Road Police Station to have Jiuxiang taken to the station. After questioning by the police chief, the police learned the details. The police said that it could not be proven who had first contracted syphilis between Jiang and Yu without a doctor's examination. It was an improper affair, and they should go to court to sue.</p>
<h3>This Year's Lywa and Lita</h3>
<p>Shanghai's High-Class Entertainment Venue, the Lywa and Lita Village in West Shanghai, was originally established by a Russian woman. However, due to the simple facilities, its prosperity was unremarkable. Starting this year, it has been taken over by the well-known Huierkang owners, Mr. Gu and Mr. Zhou. They have invested 40,000 gold to build water pavilions and add sanitary facilities. On one hand, they have installed streetlights along the way and decorated the large and small branches of the garden with colorful electric lights. On the large lawn in the garden, a special outdoor dance floor has been built. They have hired the Jing'an Temple Road Small General Assembly orchestra with a monthly salary of 5,000 gold to provide music for dancing. They do not provide dance partners but welcome high-class dancers. At the same time, the indoor dance floor has also been newly decorated to accommodate guests during rainy days. In addition, there is an open space inside the gate of the garden. Now, to make the garden more beautiful, the owners have built a new miniature golf course. The design is unique and unlike ordinary golf courses. A new pier has been built on the riverbank next to the garden, with many new-style yachts for tourists to enjoy boating at any time. The price is exceptionally low. The work is being rushed these days, and it is expected to open on the first of next month. Shanghai residents have been trapped in the city's bustling life for a long time, and they must be very enthusiastic about this piece of pure land.</p>
<h3>Nanjing Grand Theater Opens Today</h3>
<p>The Nanjing Grand Theater in this city has been closed for more than ten days due to renovations. The project is now complete. The interior decoration is magnificent, and the color scheme is elegant and outstanding. The noise reduction equipment for artificial air has also been installed and tested several times, and it is very satisfactory. The theater has also collected the masterpieces from various film companies and will continuously screen them during the summer. The theater opens today and will feature the sensational singing film "One Night of Spring" starring John Boles and Irene Dunne. As the weather has been getting hotter recently, the theater is the most temperature-appropriate theater in this city. Audiences can not only enjoy famous films but also feel refreshed and comfortable. It is expected that the theater's business will continue to flourish.</p>
<h3>Two Police Inspectors Transferred</h3>
<p>Fan Zhongliang, a police inspector in the third district of the City Public Security Bureau, was ordered by Director Chen to transfer with Liu Huansheng, a police inspector in the second precinct of the second district. Upon learning this, the leaders of various public organizations in the area, who were very pleased with Inspector Fan's many years of service in the area, jointly tried to persuade him to stay. Unable to succeed, they gathered in the district yesterday afternoon to take a photo with Mr. Fan to commemorate the occasion and hired a military band to escort him. All the police officers in the district also lined up in arms to join the send-off procession from the district gate to the Lujiazui Ferry Terminal. The sound of firecrackers was endless along the way. Inspector Liu also arrived in the district to take up his duties.</p>
<h3>Star All-Night Filming of "Such is Paradise"</h3>
<p>"Such is Paradise," the large-scale sound, silent, music, song, and dance film recently directed by Zhang Shichuan of the Star Film Company, has been filming interior scenes in a large dance hall for several days. The work is very intense. The set is magnificent, luxurious, and extremely elaborate. Various arrangements are made to beautify it as much as possible, costing a great deal of money. Beautiful musicians are hired to play music on the set, and fifty to sixty dancers are recruited from various dance halls in Shanghai. Filming continues all night for several nights in a row, costing more than 20,000 yuan. The dance hall is the background of the film, so this scene is the key to the entire film. The leading actors, Hu Die and Xia Peizhen, etc., also show their skills in dancing.</p>
<h3>Ms. Bao Yi's Painting Exhibition</h3>
<p>Ms. Bao Yi is the wife of the famous lawyer Chen Zemin. She is skilled in painting and has a collection at home, so her paintings are full of ancient flavor.

Gao Ting Record Company heard the news and considered it to have commercial value for recording and specially asked Ms. Hu to record it at the company yesterday. The result was excellent. It is said that this play is the first domestic film to have a theme song. It is also heard that Fudan Company is filming a sound film with sound on the film.</p>

<h3>Letters</h3>
<p>To the Editor: I have read a news item in your newspaper's Chuansha correspondence column on the 19th about a suicide due to a lawsuit, which is completely inconsistent with the facts. I hope you will correct it. After my late father, Zhu Houfeng, went to Gu Town to bathe after dinner on the 15th, his body was found on the fence of Zhu Songhua the next day. The Public Security First Branch immediately reported the case and sent police to guard the body and urgently reported it to the county government for an inspection. At 12:00 a.m. on the 17th, Huang Cheng, the trial officer, and Baozheng Gu Shaoshan came from the north. When they arrived dozens of steps away from the scene, they suddenly turned back to the county government. County Magistrate Tu Guangjun and Police Captain Xu Minbo revisited the scene and inspected the body. They even turned the body over once and then said that it was over, without expressing whether there were any injuries or not, and hurriedly returned to the station. They are now in the process of covering up the incident. I am afraid that the rumors are untrue, so I specially ask for a correction. Zhu Zhijing</p>
<p>To the Editor: I have recently learned from the family of Xu Yabo, the person involved, that the report published on the 17th of this month that firearms and uniforms were seized from Xu Yabo's home is inconsistent with the facts. The following declarations are made: (1) The headline of the Shenbao noted that the branch court rejected the appeal and transferred the case to Songjiang for interrogation. The case is currently under appeal in the Supreme Court and has not been transferred to Songjiang for interrogation. (2) It was said that more than ten suspects were arrested at the address on Tongfu Road and sent to the Special Zone Court together. Only Yabo was wrongly detained in this case, and there was no one else. (3) He was notified by his younger brother to secretly send confidants to Min to steal and transport firearms and ammunition. Yabo has a younger brother who works in another county and has nothing to do with the case. Moreover, the so-called A is Ding Xiuqing, who was sent by Mr. A to deliver letters to the district. This person was a patrolman during Yabo's tenure as district chief five years ago, but he has long since left. This time, he was neither sent by Yabo, and he was single-handedly sending letters without a ship. However, Xu Pucheng wanted to falsely accuse Yabo of stealing firearms and ammunition and did not hesitate to fabricate words to falsely detain the innocent. (4) The stolen ammunition and uniforms left over from his previous term were being unloaded when they were suddenly seized at Xu's house by soldiers sent by District Chief Xu. It was reported that there were three Mauser rifles left over from his term. There were only two pieces of scrap iron with incomplete mechanisms and were not useful rifles. It was said that there was one pistol, which was an air gun for hunting. It was said that the bullets and military uniforms were lead pellets and old military uniforms, all with material evidence. It is also impossible to have two large boxes and hundreds of them. Yabo has left Min for five years, and he has not returned home in the meantime. The gentry and merchants of Min can testify. The guns, etc., were found out after the fact. If it was as reported, then when Bai Chongxi came to Min to collect weapons, why would he refuse to accept them? Matters involving weapons must not be falsely accused. Please declare a correction on my behalf. The lawyer Shen Yushan, Tan Yigong, Cai Nipei, and Fan Gang, June 25, 20th year of the Republic of China</p>

<h3>World Snippets</h3>
<p>— Sea Guest</p>
<p>A Frozen Museum</p>
<p>Siberia is a world-famous cold region. The land is frozen all year round. Organic matter buried in the frozen underground can often be preserved indefinitely. For example, ancient mammoths (which are extinct elephants) have been excavated from the soil in Siberia in recent years, and their skin and flesh are still in good condition and can even be used as food. This shows that the durability of frozen ice is extremely effective. The Far Eastern Geophysical Observatory is planning to build a frozen museum to preserve the corpses of men and women of various countries and ethnic groups for centuries for future generations to study.</p>
<p>A Butcher's School</p>
<p>Westerners like to study everything in depth, so all kinds of schools are increasing day by day. Five years ago, a butcher's school appeared, called the Smithfield Institute. At that time, only twelve butchers enrolled in night classes, and the school was not very developed. However, in recent years, the number of students has surged to 850. The purpose is to teach young people the various secrets of the meat industry. Recently, an award ceremony was held. The Mayor of Holborn, who was a butcher, gave a speech, saying that when he was a butcher, he worked from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. every day and only earned four shillings. There was no such school for him to study.</p>
<h3>Blue and White Glazed Goldfish Tank</h3>
<p>— Dian Cun</p>
<p>Zhang Xun's restoration was initially supported by the majority and strongly aided. There are letters and telegrams to prove it. Xun was, after all, a military man, and he may have been reckless. But wouldn't there be wise men in his staff? Why would he take such a risk of a lone army going deep into enemy territory and making a desperate gamble? It turned out that he had obtained the consent of all parties beforehand. Xun's miscalculation was that he held all the power himself. At that time, Xun did not concurrently serve as the Minister of Political Affairs, but instead had Cao Kun take up the post. Duan Qirui was the Prime Minister, and although he wanted to oppose it, he was limited by the lack of military force. Xun only gave Kun the position of Governor of Zhili, and Kun was dissatisfied, so he lent his troops to Duan. Duan's efforts to overthrow the restoration also had another unspeakable secret. In the autumn of the Xinhai Revolution, the generals jointly asked the Qing Dynasty to abdicate. Duan actually took the lead, much like selling power and military advice, containing coercion. If the restoration had succeeded, it would have been unfavorable to Duan, so Duan started a war in Beijing, from Xuanwumen to Tiantai South River. Xun then confronted them in Tiananmen Square and Jingshan Jishuitan. In the end, because Duan had reinforcements and Xun had no support, the war could not be sustained. There was an armored vehicle with a foreign flag suddenly rushed to take Xun to the car and drove away to the Dutch embassy. When the battle was fierce, Xun's residence was also affected. Behind the house, there was a large garden, and large blue and white glazed water tanks were placed around it, with a total of six or seventy tanks. Xun was from Jiangxi and ordered them to be burned and transported from Jingdezhen. The craftsmanship was extremely delicate. Each tank had four or five goldfish, each nearly a foot long, black, white, red, and yellow. Tender green algae were printed with pink scales. There was a lively appearance in the clear water, which was quite pleasing and refreshing. Few survived the artillery shells, and the goldfish also withered due to drought. Isn't this a disaster when the city gate catches fire?</p>
<h3>The Rich Beggar</h3>
<p>— Lü Bing</p>
<p>Everyone has a compassionate heart, and beggars on the market use this point to demand money. When we see their tattered clothes and pitiful expressions, we think they are poor and have no one to turn to and do not hesitate to give them some help. In fact, most of the beggars are untrue and not complete. Many of them have quite a fortune and are enough to make ordinary people who work hard for food and clothing envious. This kind of situation is rare in our country, but there are many rumors about it overseas. Mr. Fei Qi of England has been serving in the detective world of Scotland for many years and knows the situation very well. He said that most beggars in England do not need to be restricted by their profession and their annual income is usually over 1,000 pounds. Some of them accumulate savings and eventually abandon their begging life and become wealthy. Or, they sing and beg for mercy on the street, and at night, they go to gambling halls and bars to drink and spend up to 20 pounds a week. They are all getting a lot of money without any effort, mostly the money of philanthropists.</p>
<p>An English beggar had a house in the suburbs of Hamstead and married a girl from a wealthy family. The beggar said that he was engaged in the liquor business and had to go to the city every day and return at six or seven o'clock in the evening. His wife thought he was busy with business and never knew he was begging. The beggar was well dressed when he entered the city. He rented a house in the Shahe area, where he took off his inner clothing and changed into shabby clothes. Then he bent his knees and put on a prosthetic foot. Then he bent his arm to form a severed hand and hung a card on his chest explaining that he was injured in the service of the country and became disabled. He also posted hymns to make prayers and attached a money can to receive alms. After being dressed up, there was no flaw, so he went to the area of ​​Charing Cross Street to shout for help. One day, Mr. Fei accidentally saw the beggar being able to hold the hymn and write, and then he realized his deception. He arrested him and searched him. He found that the so-called hymn was just a facade, and the content was all about the situation of daily begging and the appearance marks of those whom he regarded as often giving alms and the various times when the police patrol should be avoided. According to his confession, he had been working as a beggar since he was eighteen years old. Not only his relatives and friends were deceived by him, but also his wife who lived with him could not see the truth. By the time he was arrested, his bank deposits had exceeded 5,000 pounds. A beggar who can accumulate so much money and still refuse to give up his begging business even with so much money is enough to make those who hear it surprised and can be regarded as a strange person and a strange thing.</p>
<h3>Two Husband News Items</h3>
<p>— Zhang Guchu</p>
<p>Husband as a Maid I once read in "Laughing Grove" that a poor expectant official visited his superior and asked his wife to dress up as a male servant to accompany him. Now there is something that is the opposite and quite funny. A certain female director of a certain bureau in a certain county in Hunan should hire female servants to handle all the trivial matters in her inner room. However, the female director and her husband have a deep affection for each other and cannot bear to be separated. Her husband comes from a humble background and lacks ink in his chest and cannot work in education. Therefore, she had a strange idea and secretly ordered him to dress as a woman and serve as a maid. During the day, they look at each other as master and servant, and at night, they sleep in the same bed. They have been together for more than a month, and the security is quite tight. Unexpectedly, her husband's bad nature became sudden, and he had an affair with the wife of a male servant in the bureau. The male servant found out and sued directly to the female director. The director was sour and angry and immediately dismissed his maid. It is also a new and interesting story in the history of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Renting a Husband and Sister-in-law There is a custom of renting a wife in Ningbo, but the theory of renting a husband has not been heard before. The world is so big that there are no surprises. A case of renting a husband has been discovered in Fuyang. Hou Fumin, a farmer from Fuyang, lived and farmed with his brother Futian. Futian died of illness last autumn. His wife was not used to sleeping alone and often had secret affairs with her younger brother-in-law Fumin. This was heard by the younger sister-in-law, so a big jealousy wave started. There was quite a lot of Futian's legacy after his death. For the sake of reconciliation and convenience, Fumin asked his sister-in-law to subsidize the younger sister-in-law a certain amount of money per month in the name of renting a husband. The sister-in-law has already agreed. The younger sister-in-law is also willing to give up a love wave if she gets the money. Fortunately, the alarm is settled.</p>
<h3>Notes on the Chinese Art School Painting Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Han Ke</p>
<p>Yun Ge said: "A foot-long scroll depicts the scenery of a thousand miles, and an inch of silk depicts the potential of hundreds of feet. The masters create nature and befriend the ancients. Isn't the meaning of painting great?" In recent years, scholars who seek likeness meticulously carve and become mere painters. The general public who do not seek likeness arbitrarily paint, discarding the use of brush and ink. This is why modern painting has declined. Today, I can see a school that can advocate justice, called the Chinese Art School. Since its opening, the school has been well-known at home and abroad. The professors it hires, such as Xie Gongzhan, Wang Shizi, Zhang Shanzi, Xu Zheng, Bai Lou, Xin Kun, Ma Mengrong, Zhang Hongwei, Fang Jiekeng, and Zheng Manqing, are mostly well-known figures of the time. The achievements of the students are even more amazing. I recently opened a painting exhibition of teachers and students at the Ningbo Fellow Association, so I took the time to feast my eyes. In the works, such as the landscapes of Wu Yuanzhen, Dai He, Ding Yuerui, Kong Xiangzhong, Wang Yang, Ke Zhu, and Gu Mufei, the birds and flowers of Wang Fuding, Zuo Dequan, Huang Jinghua, Xie Junhua, Yi Min, Qu Zongxie, Wen Bingdun, and Fang Jiangshui, either follow Jingguan, or learn from Ma Xia, or caress Nantian Nansha, or write Baiyang Xinluo, they can all use ingenuity to extract their essence and combine with the ancients and then depart from the ancients. As for the scenery of the four seasons, morning and evening, the state of obscurity, wind, and rain, the posture of welcoming the wind and dew, and the appearance of flying, chirping, leaping, and leaping, they all transmit their gods and gain their reason. The purity of the brush and ink and the stability of the pattern are especially their remaining skills. At this meeting, I could not help but stop and watch with joy. (Que Chou)</p>
<h3>Travels in India (53)</h3>
<p>— Ling Hua</p>
<p>On the 17th, I visited President Lai and his wife at the American Ewing Christian College with the Englishman Gading. Mrs. Lai and many American ladies were there. Mr. Lai asked me many questions at the tea party. The couple and many others agreed with the impartiality and peace of Eastern culture.</p>
<p>On the 18th, I held a meeting at the Muslim Students Association to study. I also discovered a new theory that people say that male bears often kill and eat their cubs. This proves that the motivation for war originates from males, which is a major reason. The way Muslims eat is the same as Indians. After dinner, there is a big prayer meeting in the evening because the month of fasting is coming to an end. I visited it. They bowed their heads more than a hundred times. The method of bowing their heads is different from other religions. They stand and kneel down, bow their heads and raise their arms, which is very strenuous, so everyone wears felt hats. Without a felt hat, the head cannot bear it. The religious leader sings a song as a signal for each bow. They bow their heads four or five times each time, and get up and bow their heads one or twenty times. If women are weak, they may not be able to bear it. Muslims worship five times a day. If they bow their heads like this, it is really too difficult. I can imagine the hardship when they founded the religion. If it were not so, they would not be able to unite the masses to defend against difficulties. Religion is the greatest of hypnotism. Everything is nothing but the effect of hypnotism. Music and prayer are all the same. Prolonged hypnosis can make people forget everything and can be commanded at will. The unity of the masses can change society and create a new group. Even military training is based on the same principle. There are no statues of gods in this church, and fine incense is burned. The ground is covered with thick cushions, and no women are allowed to enter the church. I think if women pray, they must have a separate ceremony. This style is too hard for women to bear. It is said that this is a very long eternal worship because the fasting period is coming to an end, so it is not usually like this.</p>
<p>On the same day, I met Vijaza Lakihmi Samclib and his wife, who are a noble family here. Her wife's father is a friend of Gandhi. According to what I have seen in various places in France, Persian art is very related to China. I don't know when the traffic between China and Persia was very developed. Now I can prove it in England and France. Their garden has Chinese lychees, named Chinese fruits, and also likes Chinese music.</p>

<h3>??? (4)</h3>
<p>— Xu Zhuodai</p>
<p>It was still early, and Zi Liang had to rush to do his own work. He returned upstairs, not to his room, but to the pavilion in the back. This was Zi Liang's study. He opened a large bag of composition books that he had brought back from school and was about to read them when there was a sound of footsteps on the stairs. It was his wife:</p>
<p>"What side dishes are we having today? The nanny is going to buy them."</p>
<p>His wife asked with a half-smile.</p>
<p>"You can decide on these things. Why do you have to ask me?"</p>
<p>"That's not possible. If I decide now and you don't like it when you eat it, you'll blame me."</p>
<p>"No, I won't."</p>
<p>"You said it last night."</p>
<p>"Last night, because you give me soybean sprouts every day, and I'm tired of eating them, I told you to buy less of them in the future."</p>
<p>"You used to say that soybean sprouts were delicious, so I give them to you every day."</p>
<p>"Even if you eat delicacies every day, you'll get bored."</p>
<p>His wife smiled at Zi Liang after hearing this:</p>
<p>"What do you want to eat today? Think about it."</p>
<p>"These are things for the housewife to worry about. Where do I have time to think about it?"</p>
<p>Zi Liang was looking at the first student composition book he had just opened and replied to his wife.</p>
<p>"You have to eat it, but you want me to think about the side dishes all by myself? That's not fair. How about this, we each think of one dish. I'm thinking of silver fish with stir-fried kidneys. What do you think?"</p>
<p>"Whatever is fine."</p>
<p>Zi Liang was very annoyed and seemed to want her to leave quickly so he could start correcting more than a hundred composition papers.</p>
<p>"So, I have one dish. You have to think of one too."</p>
<p>"Stir-fried shredded pork with dried bean curd. Go ahead."</p>
<p>Zi Liang said it casually, thinking that his wife could go downstairs to tell the nanny. Who knew that she was still standing there and not moving:</p>
<p>"Today is Sunday, the side dishes should be more elaborate. Maybe we can make another soup. I'll do it myself and show off the skills I learned from the culinary training school last year. I guarantee you'll admire me after you eat it."</p>
<p>After his wife said this, she took out a large yuan from her pocket and walked downstairs.</p>

<h3>Financial Gold Bar Slightly Hardened</h3>
<p>Heavyweight Stable Route... Rebounds Ten Taels Six Mace</p>
<p>Wavering around twenty taels, yesterday's gold bar saw a slight rebound. Although fluctuations were unavoidable, the change did not exceed ten taels throughout the day. The market was calm, and the result was a rebound of more than ten taels. Silver prices rose very slightly. At the start, it should have opened high, but afterwards, the fluctuations were irregular and confusing. Dealers took different routes, their intentions hesitant. The price hovered around 720 taels. As for drafts, there seemed to be an advantage. The listed price did not move. Dealers were all hedging. Afterwards, there were no special changes in the market. There were no large transactions on the table. Finally, it stood between 721 taels. This morning, large amounts are expected to fall again.</p>
<p>Fluctuations After Opening High. The August opening this morning already surged thirteen taels to 723 taels. This was because large amounts only rose one-sixteenth, silver prices rose one-quarter, and private telegrams also increased by one-sixteenth. People were excited and optimistic.

<h3>Foreign Cents Continue to Hover</h3>
<p>Market Overview In the financial community, during the summer routine slump, it is difficult to find a great opportunity to seek silver dollar needs. Therefore, the daily market is stable and unchanged. In addition to the usual receipts and disbursements of various silver and money industries being more frequent than usual, other routine operations are also very quiet.

<h3>Securities Public Bonds June Term Has Stopped Auctioning</h3>
<p>Today, the stock exchange stopped auctioning due to handling delivery and settlement. The Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange decided to specially stop the market today due to the large amount of futures delivery this month and busy accounting, so as to handle the various procedures before delivery. Therefore, August futures will not be auctioned until next Tuesday, because next Monday happens to be delivery and will also stop the market. As of yesterday, the June term has stopped auctioning and the August term has not yet opened. Only the July term has a very active market for 20-year customs duties, and 19 volumes are not lonely. Others are very idle, and buying and selling transactions are far less than the previous day. A total of more than 9.4 million were opened throughout the day. The trend of various bond prices is also more stable than before, and no major changes have been seen before and after. The up and down compared to the previous day is also very small, only 19 Shan and 20 volumes of spot goods have risen sharply due to no transactions for a long time.

<h3>Yarn, Cotton Yarn Market Illusions More Obvious</h3>
<p>The yarn market rose in the morning and fell in the afternoon, and the trend was very weak. Since the actual sales have been stagnant since the various gangs stopped, it is even more lonely. In the past, absorption was sufficient, and the current gold price is also fluctuating, and people's hearts are not good. The consensus is to watch the fall. At the same time, cotton is also unstable, and the yarn market is even softer. At this time, the exchange rate is changing indefinitely, and the yarn market has no guarantee at all.</p>
<p>People's Standard Fell One or Two Taels in the Afternoon At the Exchange, the People's Standard opened in the morning with a slight increase in American cotton and a stable gold price, and the popularity on the field was good. Each month slightly increased by 3, 4 or 6 qian. In the afternoon, the market atmosphere suddenly fell, and people's hearts were very empty. Each fell by one, two or three qian. The total turnover of gold today was 35,850 bales. Mei Ji sold 1,150 bales, Senkang 1,350 bales, Yiyu 1,850 bales, Dafu bought 1,900 bales, Tianlong 750 bales, Gengfeng 2,850 bales, and Hengde 500 bales. Now the closing price of the People's Standard is recorded on the left. People's Standard Closing Rise and Fall Deposit Account</p>

<p>The Trend of Spot Yarn is Increasingly Slack The sales of spot yarn are relatively clear. Statistics of actual departures from each gang throughout the day 150 bales. 500 bales were entered in the trade. The market is trending down. 70 bales were entered from the interior by customers, 35 bales were entered from Xiamen, 85 bales were entered from Guangdong, 30 bales were entered from Shantou, 20 bales were entered from Yunnan, 25 bales were entered from Tianjin, 100 bales were entered from Gaoyang, and 50 bales were entered by miscellaneous gangs.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Feels More Tired</h3>
<p>The cotton market is very tired. Although foreign cotton is calm, the demand for spot cotton factories is extremely scarce. The yarn market has turned into a tired path. Although the sources of supply are few, the market is still difficult to excite, so the situation is weak. However, new cotton in the distant months is more expensive because of Japanese absorption.</p>
<p>Han Standard Fell Four Qian The Exchange Han Standard opened in the morning with a stable gold price and a slight increase in American cotton, and people's hearts were still flat. Each rose by 5 fen. In the afternoon, the market atmosphere suddenly loosened on the last day of this month, and the distant months were affected. Each fell by 1, 2, 3, 4 qian. The total turnover was 85,800 dan. Jifeng sold 2,800 dan, Gengfeng 3,100 dan, Yuanda 2,000 dan, Yiyu 1,900 dan, Changfeng bought 2,300 dan, Gongtai 1,100 dan, Xincheng 1,500 dan, Tianjiang 1,400 dan. Now the closing price of the Han Standard is recorded on the left.</p>

<p>Factory Demand Completely Stagnant There are very few transactions of spot cotton. Sources are estimated at 1,050 bales of Yaohua and 210 bales of Tonghua.</p>
<h3>World Cotton Yarn Trends Differ</h3>
<p>American Cotton Rose Very Slightly Yesterday American cotton was initially firm due to mass buying and strong Wall Street, but later tired due to the closing of some bulls. Futures are estimated to have risen 7 to 12 pounds, and spot goods have risen 10 pounds. English Cotton Futures rose 21 points, spot goods rose 19 points. Egyptian Cotton Spot goods rose 30 points. Indian Cotton Bulls took profits, but European exporters and Japanese firms bought hedges also slightly bought. Pingguoer is estimated to have risen 1 robi, and Oumula and Bai Luo Creek rose 4 robis.

<h3>Grain Rice Market Gradually Short</h3>
<p>Xinzha Yesterday the goods from each gang arrived continuously, sales were extremely light, and the inventory was still abundant. Because of the hot weather, the river cargo could not be delayed for a long time. Each rice was afraid of fever, and the transactions in the shops in this city were rare. Moreover, every year after the summer solstice, there must be a low point. Yesterday morning, Changxi Northern Japonica rice fell another four or five jiao. The thin rice arrived rarely and accumulated thickly. Ningwei and Xiangzhuang sales were stagnant, and the special selection of this street was slightly reduced. The market goods must be 2 chi shorter, and the total market dou foot is less than 1,000 shi. Du Yangjian arrived rarely and sold lightly. The market showed a flat state. The yin and hua sales have been decreasing day by day since the festival. The situation is high and stable, and then withered.</p>
<p>South Shanghai Yesterday the way out of each shop was weak, and the dou foot of the river was difficult to improve. Moreover, the bottom was abundant. Heavy ships stopped until 1:00 in the afternoon. The investigation of the Fengji wharf and the Dongjiadu area showed that there were about 100 ships, each ship averaging 120 shi of white rice and various indica rice, etc., estimated to be 12,000 shi, so the situation was difficult to grasp. According to letters from Liyu, Changshu, Suzhou, Tongli, Qingpu, Fengjing and other places, a lot of grain was transported to Shanghai, so the market in this port is gradually looking low. Thick japonica and early and late rice are each lower by two or three jiao, and Yang Du Jian also fell nearly 1 chi. The change of yuan yin hua is no honor or disgrace, showing a downstream trend.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Is Flat and Distant Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, each month seemed to have a slight rebound due to the excessive fall in the previous day, so although the quotation of foreign wheat was only about three or four jiao, the general floating short and temporary speculative bulls took advantage of this unfavorable environment and competed to resist. As a result, the tired situation turned and slightly rebounded, which seemed to be one fen better than the closing price of the previous day. Until the afternoon opening, the actual sales were stagnant as usual, and the long-term factories slightly threw out, causing the market to be weak and could not help but return soft step by step. Observing the situation afterwards, the sharpness has been broken, and it is also the time when new wheat is on the market. If the actual sales are still not ahead, we still look at the heavy fall. As a result, this month is slightly better than the previous day by 5 li, July is small by 5 li, August is small by 1 fen, September, November are each small by 7 li and a half, and October is small by 1 fen 2 li and a half.</p>
<h3>Recent Wheat Fell Sharply by Qian Xu</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the period wheat market showed a sluggish situation again. This month is the last day of trading, and the floating short outside the industry has no ability to abandon it at this time. The shorts are quietly waiting for the conclusion due to the low price of spot wheat, so the opening price is not good, nearly a qian lower than the previous day. At 5:00 pm, the difference was even smaller due to the urgent conclusion of the bulls. The minimum was once opened at 3 taels 6 qian 7 fen, which was a huge 1 qian 4 fen different from the closing price of the previous day. However, it returned four or five fen to the closing. The long-term months have risen and fallen several times in the morning and afternoon. However, since the arrival of goods from all roads is gradually surging and the thinking of the inland gangs has already changed, the ending still tends to be tired. As a result, this month fell 9 fen, July fell 5 fen, August fell 3 fen, September fell 2 fen, October, November fell 1 fen. The spot wheat market is still soft and the township goods are arriving in Shanghai one after another. The factories are not close and do not want to enter. A total of 1,200 bags of Chongming, Anting, Zhitang, Wusong, Yangzhou, Chuzhou, Laipeng wheat were opened. The price was similar to the previous day, and it was handled by Fufeng.</p>

<h3>North-South Goods Sichuan Pickled Mustard Tuber Rose About Yuan</h3>
<p>Sichuan pickled mustard tuber Previously, because the supply exceeded demand, the market price had fallen to 21-22 yuan, and then it was noticed by hoarders, who purchased it one after another. Therefore, the weak trend turned into a firm one, and then rose. Yesterday, the upper grade has been sold for 23 yuan and a half, which is about one yuan higher than before. When it is a vegetarian period, the appetite of each gang is still good, and the trend is stable.</p>
<h3>Silk, Tea, Yellow and White Factory Sutras, French Sales Not Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silk sales of foreign banks in this port were still not lonely. The New York silk telegram still did not see a turn, but the Lyon yellow and white factory sutras telegram continued to be transferred, and British banks in Shanghai also started to throw and buy, and the transaction was not weak. Yesterday, Taihe and others entered Shanghai white factory sutras 30 bales, and Yihe and others entered Sichuan yellow factory sutras 45 bales, and the price was still firm.</p>
<h3>Nanjing Summer Silkworms, Foreign Breeds, Demand Exceeds Supply</h3>
<p>The amount of feeding is quite smooth... The early gang has already had the first sleep and sufficient leaves. The farmers in various cities and villages of Nanjing this year suffered damage from the weather in spring silkworms, but foreign breeds (i.e. improved breeds) of silkworms still had 40% harvest, so they all raised summer silkworms to make up for the loss of spring silkworms. And they all pay attention to foreign breeds, so that the demand exceeds the supply, and the amount of feeding is quite smooth. The early gang has already had the first sleep and sufficient leaves, and the late gang is only opening the leaves and developing unfavorably.</p>
<h3>Dexing Zi Tea Is Shipped in Large Quantities</h3>
<p>This year's spring tea in Dexing County has been greatly reduced because the farmers have not been able to settle down due to the communist bandits. Most of them have not been harvested, allowing the old leaves to be harvested. In recent days, the weather has suddenly rained and heated up, and the zi tea has developed prosperously. The trees that have not been picked for the first tea are especially prosperous. Recently, the tea houses have been in great demand because the bandit atmosphere has been slightly settled, and they have begun to harvest and ship in unusually large quantities. Local and Jiyuan tea merchants are all gathered here, competing to rush for business, and the market price is about 40 to 55 yuan per dan. If the weather is sunny for days, it is expected that the tea will have a large and abundant harvest.</p>
<h3>Zhangshan New Tea Is Rushed to Be Cleaned</h3>
<p>The mountain households in Zhangshan are half harvested and half made. Because the weather has turned cold, the development of tea buds is slow, and they have only recently been successively harvested. According to statistics, the total output of the whole mountain is about 50% lower than the old one. The tea houses in Yibei have rushed to the mountain to handle the Zhangshan tea with excellent water and leaves. After the discussions of more than ten tea houses such as Che Tian and Taichang, they decided to divide the melon and set the price at 80 yuan, which has now been completely traded.</p>
<h3>Wuyuan Zi Tea Opens the Scale</h3>
<p>This year's spring tea in Wuyuan County has been reported to be in short supply in each village, and the tea houses and tea stomachs are mostly unsatisfied. They all hope that the zi tea will be abundant to make up for the previous shortage. Recently, the weather has suddenly heated up, and the zi tea buds have grown quickly. Generally, mountain households believe that spring tea is not prosperous, and rare things are expensive. From the day before yesterday, they have rushed to harvest early. The market price is 6 jiao to 7 jiao per catty, and the price is no higher or lower than the first tea. According to the eagerness of the tea houses' stomachs, the tea price still has a rising trend.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods Prices Fell More Than They Rose</h3>
<p>The trend in the local cloth market yesterday was increasingly poor, mainly because after the gold market declined, people's hearts were weakened. In addition, as the end of the month approached, those in urgent need of funds were eager to sell. Dealers, seeing the market sluggish, mostly stopped trading. As a result, prices gradually declined. Fine cloth fell by 5 cents, fine twill fell by 7.5 cents, 84 grey cloth fell by 5 cents, and coarse cloth also softened accordingly. 9-pound and 11-pound cloths all declined. 13-pound cloths declined slightly. 16-pound cloths were still able to hold steady because there were not many in stock. Coarse twill was still selling for 5 yuan, still firm. Eight and a half liang Three Fish, Three Ghosts, and Cat English cloth all fell, only Golden Pagoda continued to rise, needing 9 liang 3 qian, it is said.</p>
<p>The trend of falling prices for East and West piece goods was very strong, and sales to customers had a sharp decline, mainly due to the weak gold market and people's fluctuating sentiments. Yesterday, East goods, including tribute woolen cloth, continued to fall. Moganshan and Lieyan had a fall of 3 qian 7.5 fen, and Four Gentlemen, because the end of the month was approaching, fell even more, selling at 3 qian 1 fen 7.5 li. Flannel goods fell one after another. Zhongbing Yue flannel fell 2 qian 4.5 fen. Yang Guifei flannel fell 2 fen and a half. Big Red Flannel fell 2 qian 4 fen 2.5 li. Colored Striped Flannel was 8 liang 1 qian and a half. Only Yuan Yu silk was still firm. Qingguan Mirror was 12 liang 3... Zhulin was 12 liang 3 qian 3... 12 liang... Will transport... Farming... had quite a few methods. Western goods bleached cloth was still firm, with the rest declining slightly, it is said.</p>
<h3>Metal White Lead Pig Increased by Two Pounds</h3>
<p>The metal trade was still quiet yesterday, so apart from some scattered trading in the gold market that was slightly more lively, most business was still declining. However, the pricing for overseas white lead pig increased by two pounds yesterday according to telegrams, estimated at 28 pounds, 7 shillings, and 6 pence per ton. Although actual transactions still showed no improvement, it greatly boosted confidence in the local market. The foreign firms reported that white lead yesterday had a good telegraph, at 4 pounds.</p>
<h3>English Tinplate 100-pound Spot is Short</h3>
<p>Among tinplates, 100-pound English tinplate spots suddenly reported shortages, so more people were buying and the market was getting better. The market price has risen to 17 liang 2 qian and a half per box, which is already 2 qian and a half better than before.</p>

<h3>Marshal Foch's War Memoirs</h3>
<p>— Translated by Gu Angruo</p>
<p>However, although the German army did not achieve a strategic victory in this war, the war in this area could be resumed at any time. The enemy could use submarines to harass the nearby sea and cut off the Allied forces' communications with Britain, isolating the British Isles and rendering them helpless. At the same time, they could use large numbers of troops to directly approach the coast of the strait at the cost of great sacrifice. Therefore, the position of the Allied forces has not yet turned from danger to safety.</p>
<p>Our army's loss of many places allowed the German army to occupy Mount Kemmel, and the Allied defense line's northern shield, Mount Flanter, was in imminent danger. If our defense line was to avoid wavering, Mount Flanter had to be defended with all our might. I therefore ordered Commander Mitry not only to consolidate the defenses of Mount Flanter, but also to deploy defenses to the foothills to prevent the enemy from encircling the summit and sneaking through the waist of the mountain. On May 4, the northern detachment's local operations made considerable progress in this regard.</p>
<p>The Battle of Flanter also had the result that the Pesinay coal region was also subjected to German artillery fire. The miners experienced serious unrest, and the coal needed by the armory and railways was greatly affected. Fortunately, with the efforts of the British army and the French liaison officer stationed at the British army headquarters, this situation was remedied.</p>
<p>The Allied forces' strength was greatly reduced as a result of the Battle of Flanter. The British army's reserves had already been used up, and ten divisions of French reserves had been transferred to help in the war.</p>
<p>I and General Haig agreed to transfer the British reserves withdrawn from the front to the peaceful area of the French line and hand them over to Commander Petain for reorganization. The French army also withdrew a portion to replenish its reserves, but this transfer could only be implemented slowly. Commander Petain first incorporated the four divisions of the British army's Ninth Army Group into the French Sixth Army and transferred them to the Kron Lovoer Line in mid-May for defense.</p>
<p>The Battle of Flanter lasted for a month, and the French army's deployment lost its equilibrium. At the beginning of May, the French army had forty-seven divisions north of the Arras River (twenty-three divisions at the front and twenty-four divisions in reserve). From the Arras River to the Swiss border, the defense line was guarded by only fifty-five divisions, that is, forty-three divisions at the front and twelve divisions in reserve. Commander Petain asked me to pay attention to the dangers posed by this situation.</p>
<p>The heavy losses suffered by the British army could not be ignored, but the enemy had the possibility of attacking again between the Arras River and the Leie River. Moreover, because this line was very close to the target of the decisive battle, victory or defeat had a great impact on the Allied forces. I therefore maintained four divisions north of the Somme River and deployed the same number of troops south of the Somme River. However, I did not change the transfer of troops to support the northern detachment.</p>
<p>At the same time, I made every effort to deploy American troops to benefit the French army commander's military affairs. The American First Division had already entered the defense line of the French First Army on April 26, and the battle on May 28 immediately captured the village of Contigny, proving that the American army's combat effectiveness was not weak. I asked Commander Pershing to immediately transfer the 26th, 42nd, and Second Divisions to the front, and to leave the American infantry 32nd, Third, and Fifth Divisions as reinforcements for the French army. I further asked him to send American airmen to French air force units for practice and to reduce the workload of French air force personnel. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>The Progress of the Himalayan Climbing Team</h3>
<p>Advancing along the glacier to the summit: A report from Garhwal states that Mr. Smith and his party are currently climbing Mount Kamet (25,431 feet) in the Himalayas. The following report, dated seven days ago, has arrived in Garhwal. It is said that the climbing team arrived at the front of the Eastern Kamet Glacier on the 6th, and the entire team is in good health. The climbing base unit departed from Niti, near the valley of Lenwoni, the last village in the climbing route, on the 5th, accompanied by thirty porters and thirty yaks carrying food supplies. These yaks appear brave, but are actually very gentle. When loaded, they are easily startled and run away, which causes difficulty. However, there was no major loss of goods. They advanced with a steady pace along the steep slope. As they moved away from the village of Niti, the terrain gradually became barren and rocky. The group plans to depart from Fishtiab on the 8th with forty porters and climb along the Eastern Kamet Glacier to a point at 16,800 feet. The next day, they will reduce the number of porters and advance to a point at 18,500 feet, where they will set up a camp. Messrs. Bori and Piman will return to Fishtiab first after transporting the remaining supplies with the porters. Both gentlemen have gradually become accustomed to the rapid changes in climate and terrain and should have no difficulty transporting the remaining supplies. If the current good weather continues, the fourth base will be set up at a location of 22,500 feet in two weeks. It is planned to transport ten days' worth of food supplies to the fourth camp. After digging caves in the ice and snow at that location to conserve energy, they will then advance to higher altitudes and establish a simple camp to launch an assault on the highest peak. Also, Mischief Gorge, said to be 2,000 feet deep, is suspicious according to our survey. The natives in the group are practicing climbing glaciers with ropes, etc. Mr. Girilai is also measuring the blood pressure of the group members. People in the lower realms are spying on us and will be surprised that we have grown long beards and hair, becoming barbarians in the sky dome. We have a phonograph and abundant food supplies. We are very happy, it is said.</p>
