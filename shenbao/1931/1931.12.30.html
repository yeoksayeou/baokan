<p>第一次全體會議、自從本月二十日開會起、至今天已有一星期了、在這一星期中、開過兩次預備會議、四次正式會議、已得到很圓滿的結果、不但是我們一般同志都覺得安慰、就是總理在天之靈、看到我們大會有此良好的結果、也是很安慰的、過去幾年來、本黨同志中間、因有種種的糾紛、大家散至四方、没有好的機會能共聚一堂、討論黨國的大計、今天居然能夠如願以償、無論東西南北各方面的同志、都相率來京、集合一堂、决定黨國今後的方針、這種良好的現象、是從來所未有的、也可以說是本黨改組以來、没有那一次全體會儀能如這一次大會有親愛精誠團結一致的偉大精神的表現、這一次不但是一般同志可以告慰自己、同時我們對於此次來京同志救黨救國的誠意、表示最大的敬意、這一次黨內同志、能夠得到精誠團結的結果、我們又不能不想起蔣介石同志這種偉大精神的表現如無蔣同志這種偉大精神的一有現、也不能感動全體同志、有此良好的機會、使大家集合在一起的、所以我們回想這幾天內開會精神之良好結果之圓滿、不能不對蔣同志表示最大的敬佩、過去間黨內種種使一般國民失望的希望、經過這一次全體會儀的討論、爲黨開一新紀元、使在黨全體同志、都能集中聰明才力、領導民衆、爲國民革命努力、以完成總理未莧之大業、這是今後本黨同志所負的最大使、命這一個重大的使命、除了中國國民黨以外、再没有一個團體和一個力量、能繼承負得起的、在此國難方殷的時間、對內對外的因難、爲從來所未有、但是一般國民、在過去間、雖對於本黨失望、今後本黨當抱定最大的决心、充實革命的力量、爲國民前驅、合國民期望、對外竭力應付空前未有之國難、對內盡力解除四萬萬同胞之痛苦、這兩種重大的工作、還是在本黨同志繼續不斷的努力、所以本黨同志感覺到自己責任的重大、尤應澈底覺悟、以忠誠坦白之懷、相親相愛、相信相助、共同爲國家民族而努力、就是從前在方法上做不對、不能在最短期間完成訓政、這一種過失、是要我們負擔的、但不是那一人的過失、是本黨全體同志的過失、那末我們應有自省的覺悟、其次我們要曉得、革命工作所以不能完成、是由於方法不對、今後應改良方法、糾正過失、重新努力、以完成我們的使命、這不祇是關係於本黨的前途、抑且關係中華民族的存亡、如果從今天起、大家還不能糾正以前的過失、敢弦更張、爲黨關一新生命、則民衆對黨的信仰、必喪失殆盡、本黨如失去了領導民衆的地位、結果我們的黨、必遭滅亡、同時黨亡了、國家也没有出路、所以今後的工作、簡單的說、就是救黨救國的工作、因爲我們要救國、所以不能不使黨充實而先救黨、救黨的目的、是在救國、救國的使命是在黨、以黨救國、並非以黨專政、來支配國家、使中華民族永遠在黨的訓政之下討生活、是要實現憲政、使人民能夠運用直接民權、完成民主政治、訓政不過是一種革命的手段、憲政才是革命的目的、這是我們黨的唯一使命、我們黨員的責任、旣如此重大、我們從今天起、在總理遺像之前、下最大的决心、糾正以往過失、重新努力、來完成總理未竟之事業、而達到救黨救國之目的、這是在今天大會閉會時、兄弟所貢獻一點誠懇的意思、希望得着中央同志及全黨同志誠意採納的、孫科致詞畢、由于右任宣讀大會宣言後、由中委馮玉祥演說、各位同志、在此國難當前的時候、國家的危險、到了萬分的地步、兄弟在此盛大莊嚴的會塲中說話、覺得有無窮的感想、在民國十三年的時候、總理屢次寫信及託朋友昭示於兄弟、就是要使中國的獨立自由平等早日實現、這種遺訓、至今尙在心頭、總理人格的偉大、光明的志願、才能感動人心、能收極大的效果、但是不幸的事實接踵而來、如「五三」事件、「墨西哥排華」事件、「朝鮮排華事件」以及「萬寳山慘案」、都足以使我們萬分痛心的、不意我們在萬分的痛心當中、日本又以兵力强佔我東北三省、遼寗八十六萬六里的地方、一千四百餘萬的人口、吉林八十八萬方里的地方、一千五百餘萬的人口、黑龍江一百七十六萬方里的地方、四百餘萬的人口、在幾天內、都被日本帝國主義者强奪以去、這使我們尤其萬分痛心的、所以現在要把總理所昭示於我們的遺訓、就是使中國脫離次殖民地的地位、而躋於獨立自由之域、同時使民主政治早日實現、我們應當如何去做呢、這一年來、兄弟雖在山中過活、也無時忘却了這個責任、最近接到中央同志的電召來京出席大會、兄弟以爲國難當前、自己那能自逸、故來京與各位見面、商量今後的努力、兄弟嘗不斷的想、如果要渡過目前的國難、唯有如哲生右任兩先生所說精誠團結一致對外、換句話說、就是一心一德共禦外侮、我們祇有在總理靈前自悔自懺、糾正以往錯誤、對國家對民族、切實負起責任來、才對得起一般國民、恢復本黨的信用、如汪胡兩先生、都是偉大的革命家、總理的信徒、我們盻望大家起來、共謀救國、還有一位我的把弟蔣介石同志、我們曾在鄭州同寫過海枯石爛永久不渝的誓書的把弟、在他已經下野了、他雖然有他的短處、可是也有他的長處、所以我們也極希望他能出來、盡自己的力量、以共赴國難、至於此次兄弟來京、並非有所希求、不過因爲兄弟在山中天天接到靑年的信、向兄弟說在此國難當前的時候、不能一人在山中以寫字作畫自修、兄弟迫於自己的責任、來京參與大會、今天兄弟對各位所貢獻的話、完全是出於兄弟的誠心誠意、盻望全國同胞全黨同志指正、馮演講畢、李委員濟深演說、（二十九日專電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<p>這一年</p>
<p>一年來的經濟（上）</p>
<p>一九三一年的中國經濟。在縱的時間上。是緊接着一九三○年有充分的歷史性而展開的序幕。在橫的空間上。更是聯繫在整個世界經濟網系中不可分離的一個單位。所以。在這裏。我們要從時間上的一九三一年。和空間上的中國。支離破碎的來說明中國經濟。這工作可以說是「未免太笨。」</p>
<p>不過。中國經濟在整個世界經濟網系中。他自有其特質。他自有其不平衡性。而且在時間上基於辯證法的定律。一九三一年的中國經濟。在洶湧澎湃瞬息萬態的整個世界經濟之洪流中。也自與一九三○年各自不同。這便是我們所以在此剖析和叙說一年來中國經濟的理由。</p>
<p>這種解剖和叙說的工作。是不很容易的。因爲第一。在中國。根本就没有數　目字的統計。不說是本年。甚至遠在十年以前也没有數目字可以作參考的根據。第二。中國經濟的性質。現在正是大家所爭持辯論的一個謎樣的問題。「智者見智。仁者見仁。」所以。在這裏我們的剖析與解說。也很難求得其正確。因此。我們只能在可能範圍以內。叙說一九三一年中國經濟體系上所發生的新事實。同時也只能在我們可能體解的範圍以內。指陳一九三一年中中國經濟轉捩的方向。</p>
<p>在今年。世界資本主義經濟恐慌。以空前的震撼力。動搖着世界資本主義的結搆。農業的凋敝。工業的衰落。貿易的減退在在都足以證明世界資本主義已臨到行將崩潰的絕境。正因爲世界經濟之凋敝。整個資本主義經濟體系之動搖。所以中國經濟在其抽搐中間。乃遭受鉅大的影響。呈現明顯的變化。換言之即中國經濟日益凋敝。日益殖民地化。中國折平民大衆。日益困陷於悲慘苦痛的深淵。</p>
<p>一年來中國經濟上所顯呈的現象</p>
<p>（一）農村經濟加速崩潰。本來自從帝國主義者勢力伸入中國農村。中國農村經濟。便無日不在崩潰腐朽的過程中。加以曆年來的戰亂。饑荒。和土匪騷擾。更加速了崩潰過程進展的速度。特别是今年。由於（甲）世界經濟之衰落。（乙）十八省區空前的大水災。（丙）共產黨騷擾地域之擴大三個重要原因。農業經濟崩潰的過程之加速。尤其顯著。因爲世界經濟凋敝。世界工業生產低落農產品大跌價。中國的農產品在世界市塲上。便迅速地爲其他資本主義國家所排擠。如中國茶被排擠於印度茶。至今上海囤積的茶。簡直無人問訊。如中國絲被排擠於日本生絲及人造絲據今年六月間絲的行市。即照來價拋售。每包仍須虧蝕二百餘兩。而且成交寥落。市况极爲蕭索。絲的出產地（浙江。）且因此而有創辦人造絲廠的計劃。如果東北的特產之輸出。去年十月到今年三月。運輸總額累計。和去年同時期比較。顯形激。减即大豆一項。相差已將近五十萬噸之多高梁一項。本年三月從大連出口的一萬一千二百七十九噸。和去年同月比較减少一百五十六噸之多。黑龍江廣信公司。和吉林永衡官銀號等各銀行貯存的大豆。約有四十萬噸。哈爾濱一帶大豆十分之七。是握在銀行的手裏。價格的起落自然是爲銀行家一手操縱。農業品輸出激减。這是促進農業經濟凋敝的因素之一由於今年泛濫十八省區的空前大水災。使中國的農業。更蒙受空前的浩刦。僅就山東河南安徽江蘇湖北湖南江西浙江八省區已有報告的損失。統計受災面積一四一·七。（單位百萬畝）受災農户八·五七九。（單位千户）農數量損失稻九十萬萬斤。折成凈米約合六十萬萬斤。高梁小米折凈成粉約合十萬萬斤每人每年需米麵約四百斤。足敷一千八百萬人全年之食。農產價損失計四五·六六。（單位百萬元）實際上被災區域共有十八省區。被災人數至少有五千萬以上。至於棉麥稻禾及各種農產上的損失。和農田農具以及廬舍等全部的損失。目前雖尙無統計。但其數目字總有驚人之鉅大。這還是就直接蒙受於水災的損失而言至於農田冲毀。無法修復。農具種子。蕩然無存。來年無田可耕。無種可下。飢寒所迫。少壯流離。老幼餓斃。間接的損失更是無法計算。目前我們吃的米麥麪粉。以及一切雑糧。都上從外國輸來的。如一九三○年一月至七月上海一埠米的輸入。已達七千多萬兩。天津上海東三省等處麪粉工廠都用洋麥製粉。水災後向美國借來的大宗麥子。是盡人皆知的事實。我們穿的棉織品和絲織品。也是由外國輸入。其他各種生活必需的原料。也很多是依賴於外國輸入。我們的衣食住行一言以蔽之。我們的生活資料。整個的握在外人的手裏。就此可以證明由於災荒的打擊。我國的農產額。已减至極度。這是促進農業經濟凋敝的因素之又一。由於共產黨以及土匪騷擾區域之擴大。使很多的地方都無法耕種。如江西。湖北。湖南。安徽。福建。幾乎是全省。如四川。河南。廣西。江蘇。浙江。廣東也有很多的縣分都爲共產黨出没騷擾的區域。在這廣大的區域。以官軍的圍剿。和共軍的遊擊。民皆逃亡。田皆荒廢。自然是毫無農業生產可言。其他還有山東。河南。陜西。山西綏遠東三省等處的土匪之騷擾。也同樣的使農民流亡。農業荒廢。雖說共產黨與土匪勢力之擴大。即是農村經濟破產的結果。但其騷擾與遊擊。則又恰成爲促進農村經濟加速崩潰的因素之三。此外。更因爲農業技術的落後。農村中封建剥削關係之存在。捐稅之繁重。軍人官吏之榨取。商業之剥削。以及國內運輸系統的大規模破壞。使農民陷於絕對窮困。在奪去了土地中的化學質以後。絕對没有力量補充肥料。陜甘一帶。已成不毛之地。即東北處女地。因剥削過甚。也日變瘠薄。農產額的縮减。更是自然的現象。這又促進農業經濟崩潰的另一要因綜合而言。由於世界經濟的凋敝。由於普遍全國的災與人禍。由於帝國主義之吸吮。與商業資本高利貸租佃捐稅等之剥削。在今年我國農業經濟已臨到絕境。已臨到破產的極度。平民大衆。簡直是被埋在水深火熱的人間地獄。歸死無所。求生無門。</p>
<p>更正　昨評「財務組共收大洋六六八九八四七七五元」應改正爲「六·六八九·八四七元」</p>

<p>▲葫蘆島竟認日本貿易港</p>
<p>▲與淸津大連等三港統一</p>

<p>▲統一三港　　日本在東北方面之運輸、以大連港爲出海之唯一途徑、近年自我國東省添建各鐵路開闢葫蘆島以來、滿鐵與大連水陸運輸上、已受重大打擊、故急不暇擇、採用武力、旣奪占我東北、又進而爲統一海運、故急攻錦州、爲奪取葫蘆島之張本、欲將大連·淸津·及葫蘆島·三港併合開發、將有妨礙其貨物出口之關稅、實行撤廢、使日本對海岸之大連灣·朝鮮海口之淸津·渤海灣之葫蘆島·三處貿易港、統一主權、同時開發、則北韓·北滿·之出口貨、更可盡量輸出、數年以後、可達到占日本海港貿易之第一位、</p>
<p>▲議增船舶　　日本在旅大方面之商輪、已有八十七艘、占註册噸三十四萬三千五百八十二噸、又有千噸以下小輪四十八艘、帆船一百三十八艘、近日日本當局、已與該國輪船業各汽船會社磋商、討論繁榮大連·淸津·葫蘆島·三海港之貿易及航務、計在日本內地各埠及敦賀伏木等港、增添直放該三海港之輪船、而島谷汽船會社、已先建造新輪二艘、各三千五百噸、準備明年二月內行駛該路新班、而大阪汽社、亦預定在明春落成之新建十輪中、派數船行走三海港、</p>
<p>▲移殖日人　　自我國抵制日貨以來、日本國內失業工人日多、現聞已經日本當局議定、决將失業之日本勞工、由政府撥欵助其移殖、到遼吉各省、從事開發等項、今第一批已先由本埠某日輸社派船至日載運、計爲該國川口工廠之失業工人四千七百名、業已開始移送到遼寗、而二次三次之移送日人、正在計擬之中、</p>
<h3>兵工廠昨日</h3>
<p>提早發年賞</p>
<p>▲前日誤會發生紛擾</p>
<p>▲昨日發欵風潮平息</p>
<p>上海兵工廠於前日下午、突然發生工友搗毁辦公所、毆傷庶務科長彭振之、包圍廠長宋式驫風潮、茲將各情詳誌如下、</p>
<p>▲發動原因　　此次肇事、係因工友請發年終獎金、該廠年終獎金爲十萬元、當郭承恩廠長移交時、曾電准軍政部、扣除墊欵二萬元、故尙有八萬、本年軍政部經費奇絀、曾會議將本年度年終獎金、停止發給、惟該廠廠長宋式驫氏、以年終獎金、相沿已久、若一旦驟然停發、與各工友年關用費預算、大有影響、除於陳儀次長前來滬時、當面力請外、並於廿五日親自赴京、向兵工署力爭、亦經許可、故宋氏遂於前日返滬、</p>
<p>▲搗毁情形　　當宋氏返滬前、曾發一電、通知該廠會計課長、轉知各工友、照常安心工作、獎金已經接洽允許云云、惟會計課以宋氏雖有電課知照、惟以有無的欵、尙無所知、恐通知貼出後、工友向課索、欵無以應付、故未敢將此電文佈告、而各工友以年關在邇、獎金尙未發給、深恐無着、遂於宋廠長下午三時抵廠後、即將宋氏包圍、初、宋氏尙站於總辦公所之水門汀上、向工友宣佈准三十日發工資、三十一日發獎金、以工友未允、遂改於三十日發獎金、三十一日發工資、工友方面、以三十一日停工、復請宋氏於二十九日發放、宋氏以廿九日手續方面、决趕不及、遂趨避於文書科總收發處、工友大忿、遂動手將辦公所之廠長室·秘書室·庶務科·等、完全搗毁、並用扶梯登樓、施行搗毁、嗣以樓上爲郭前廠長辦理移交之處、故遂退下、</p>
<p>▲科長被毆　　當工友施行搗毁時、宋廠長及所有職員、均已躱避、故僅聞玻璃破碎之聲、時該廠庶務科長彭振之、適行經過辦公廳、被工友誤認爲宋廠長、羣加毆擊、並將彭　於地下、嗣經其他工友證明誤會、始行釋放、然彭已被擊傷矣、</p>
<p>▲調停經過　　至八時許、工友尙未散去、經該廠工務處長張德慶、及其他職員出而調解、允於二十九日發給獎金、三十日再發工資、至此、工友遂認爲滿意、至十時餘、始紛紛散去、</p>
<p>▲昨發獎金　　昨日下午一時、廠方盡力設法、將該項獎金按名發給、直至四時始告完竣、一塲風波、亦告平息、</p>
<h3>英商公共汽車</h3>

<p>▲罷工損失　　售票員罷工後、公司因此將各路公共汽車完全停駛、每日售票曁其他一切損失約四千元、三日計算、約萬餘元、全體售票員因罷工而犧牲工資、每月以二十三元爲比例、每日約二百元、三百共六百餘元、</p>
<p>▲表示屈服　　售票員昨對新聲社記者表示、此次爲援助一號售票問題、實行罷工、目的爲解除切身痛苦、但因事前毫無準備、事後未有組職、以致意見分歧、加以公司態度强硬、竟宣告革退全體罷工工人、呼　無門、不得不屈服於壓迫之下、無條件復工、而罷工期內、犧牲工資、已壓三天云、</p>

<h3>玳梁憶語</h3>
<p>— 燕子</p>
<p>白山黑水之間。代出英傑。遜淸末葉之劉癉之　天　子等。均自綠林草漭中崛起。與張作霖馮麟閣等能橫東北。威嚴一時。惟一則在野。一則在朝。略有分别耳。當光復之初。吾鄕潘劍星君。經商遼吉。與劉癉子結莫逆交。同來海上。添購軍械。設宴於一枝香。函招陪座。乃與朱君子瀕同往。初以爲劉必英雄氣槪。望之嚴然。詎相見之下。大爲驚詫。所爲紅鬚首領之劉癉子。乃布衣誠樸之顎然一鄕曲老農也。略與寒喧。口訥訥這善酬酢。惟虎腰猿臂。目露威稜。體質修偉。年已望六。鬚髮蒼白。終席不發一言。潘盛言劉之部下逾萬人。能守軍律。偶犯姦淫。殺無赦。畢衆畏之如天神。出没於南北滿軌道區域。日俄均懼其勢。鴨綠江一帶發生巨案日軍時受其蹂躪焉。劉生平絕技。能伏於馬背雙手開槍槍無虛發。軍警團劉於皇姑屯。劉率十餘騎抗戰。發槍殲敵。躍馬踚重圍而逸。瞬息不見。卒亦無如之何。劉之驍勇善戰。遼人類能言之。茲之所記。祇一鱗半爪耳。</p>

<h3>南北兩馬譚</h3>
<p>— 淸癯</p>
<p>何謂兩馬，曰、一在東北海倫之「馬占山。」一在南中滬上之「馬湘伯。」同姓馬。而在東北人則稱之爲「好馬。」在南中人則稱之爲「老馬。」馬之負重望於時。亦盛矣哉。試述兩馬如下。自暴日侵襲我遼吉以後。以絕塞孤軍。限倭宼之兵鋒。不至盡陷於鐵騎之下。而留一綫軍人之聲光者。無不以馬將軍競稱。是則馬將軍。果爲何如人乎。馬氏原籍係遼寗懷德。起家行伍。在吳晉陞綰龍江時。初爲二十九師排長。繼升爲連長。未幾。又升爲營長。自是團長旅長師長。以次而上。北方震其名者。稱天驕焉。當民國十五年。直奉之戰。不過充騎兵一軍長耳。能以五百騎兵。追擊西北軍一萬於彰德。繳其槍械至半數之衆。可不謂之驍將乎。前後歷戎行三十年。遷擢有加。曾無一日之退休、此次對抗倭軍。而其名始聞於全國。將軍年四十八。字秀芳。有子女各一。子名奎。號子元。女名淑琴。已適人。其老母識大義。退却克山時。將軍猶堅持。以博最後之勝利。老母遣卒貽以書曰。「軍事至此。宜以龍江全城之生命爲重。脫一失陷。其何以謝無辜之人民。」故將軍非戰敗。不得不重母命也。時張景惠猶以電話說將軍。將軍答以「四爺如降日。則人各有志。不能相强。馬占山自信爲好男兒。絕不肯屈伏。唯有拚命到底而已。」故將軍今在海倫。猶厲兵秣馬。以圖反攻。一如初志。無或有貳焉。</p>
<p>滬上寓公。以耆老著稱於時者。首推馬湘伯氏。氏爲丹徒籍。今年已九十餘矣。早歲游法。信仰羅馬敎。爲高僧。其弟名建忠。敭歷國外。於中西文字尤深邃。成馬氏文通一書。學者靡不宗之。氏長於辨才。每登壇演說。慷慨激昂。能深入顯出。以博得聽衆之一快。鼓掌四起。輒聲震屋樑。二十年前滬西震旦學校。爲法人所剙立。孔子誕日。學生以尊孔爲名。相率離校。初組復旦於愛文義路。繼遷至吳淞綠營公所。推氏爲校長。時于右任爲學生。隱名劉學裕。稱學長兄。而諸生呼氏爲「馬老頭」。其校僕有名洪緒者。年亦埀老。爲氏親信。亦以此三字爲護符。諸生聞名。輒畏之。可知其尊嚴已。嗣爲某銀行所累。有宋雪琴者。控氏於縣廷。卒賴多數學生持旛迎出。其得莘莘學子之崇仰。有如是者。梁任公發起政聞社於日本之東京。邀氏爲長。迺揭櫫「神我」二字爲宣言。太炎章氏闢之。謂「漢有胡廣。明有胡廣。」中庸之道旣同。「漢有馬良。淸有馬良。」協穆二家。亦復古今一揆。蓋氏祖笛卞爾言。本「思在即我在」之指。與數論云「我是思」者等。故餘杭譏之云。然氏値此存亡危急之際。縱克享遐齡。而以衰朽之老翁。猶能主張「良心救國」。追逐時流。未始不由「神我」推演以出。苟人之葆存此一點靈明。不至泊没。倭人雖狡。其如無以亡我何。噫、茲兩馬者。誠非駑駘下駟所能展其足而望其塵已。</p>
<h3>世界小事記</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>偷看報紙是犯罪坐在電車中。從别人的肩頭偷看别人正在閱看有報紙。在美國是一件犯罪的事情。最近華盛頓有一位市民。因爲犯了此罪。那報紙的主人和他閙起來。捉將官裏去。終於判罰了五個金鎊。</p>
<p>車馬塞途的損失　倫敦市街中繁忙已極。往往車馬塞途。一時不能通行。而因此汽車所耗費的汽油以及營業延擱所受的間的接損失。每年不下二千五百萬金鎊。</p>
<p>美國女學生的制帽　美國某地有一個上大學。那第一年級的女生。須戴一種特别規定制帽。帽上矗白色和紫色的羽毛。甚是好看。</p>
<p>象的洗浴　倫敦動物院中。大象很多。每年規定洗浴一次。以增美觀。洗浴的水中。須用一種特製的油。每洗一頭。需八加倫之多。</p>
<h3>抵制聲中之好消息</h3>
<p>— 天相</p>
<p>暴日之經濟侵略手段。固誠可惡。然平心而論。其運輸來華之各種日用品。確能迎合購者心理。務使適合實用。以精靈巧妙見勝。此則毌庸爲諱者。蓋其孜孜研求之苦心。與夫工於摹仿之精神。殊未可湮滅也。</p>
<p>際此抵制日貨正在急不容緩之時。提倡國產。誰敢後人。惟望各出品家。多所研究。以適用爲前提。成績須駕舶來品而上之。國人自必舍外貨而用國產矣。</p>
<p>今就微者小者而言。毛筆。爲我國數千年來之特產品。自海航交通。日人之來華者。莫不視爲貴品。即就其質料仿造。數十年來我國之出品依舊。而倭人已精益求精。反運華暢銷。近據調查。即此一項。年耗國幣二十餘萬金。國人不圖改進。坐失巨利。豈不可惜。</p>
<p>日人運華之筆。名白圭。筆鋒細小。剛柔適性。用作書畫。有得心應手之妙。友人黄君。從事美術。日用此品。而憾於日貨。有心自製。俾挽回漏巵。藉謀抵制。昨承見告。已集資創設大中文具社於新閘路鴻瑞里。專造白玉一種。悉心研究。質料均仿白圭。成績良好。定價低廉。此亦抵制聲中之好消息也。因樂爲之記。</p>
<p>來函　日前自由談戴睇嚮齋逞　談。與不除庭草齋夫談薈中。皆涉用蔡子民先生事。所舉事實皆誤。用爲更正。㈠立法院議民法姓氏問題。蔡先生非立法委員。並未參預。睇嚮齋所云之討論。乃爲立法院公宴敎育會議代表席上之演說。蔡先生僅云將來可廢家庭。此時則姓從父從母均可。李胡並無反駁。當時南京民生報曾載各人所言之大意。甘簃所引殆得諸耳食也。㈡國民會議開幕。蔡先生並無親筆所書之頌詞。不除庭草齋夫欲從頌詞罪蔡先生之失言。似亦近吹毛求疵也。一笑。蔡先生病中不問外事。偶有所談。不欲涉辯駁之迹。故代爲剖明如上。楊銓。十二月二十六日。</p>

<p>— 張孝若</p>
<p>悼沈卓吾</p>
<p>這個年頭。朋友的死。眞越來越奇酷了。</p>
<p>徐志摩慘死天空。我做了悼文挽詩。不久以後。又來了沈卓吾慘死水中的惡耗。不由人不生朋舊凋零浮生若夢之感</p>
<p>卓吾於十二月十二日在上海因事乘大德輪往通。次午行至滸浦七望沙江面。中艙忽然起火。施救不及。頓時延燒全輪。事後遇救的人中。不見卓吾。找到的屍中。也不見卓吾。卓吾的生命。恐是無望的了。難道志摩一飛不返。卓吾一沈不起了嗎。</p>
<p>卓吾是如臯人。到上海來至少總有三十年了。聽說他是一個很貧苦人家的子弟。父親早年去世。賴母氏撫敎成人。也没有財力受充分的敎育。到上海的時候。眞是一個光桿。毫無依附。慿着他的能力。向前奮進。赤手空拳。造成一個成家立業的格局。經營晚報。何等的堅韌。終於成功。開上海晚報的先聲。對於同鄉。無論經濟的事業的希求。没有不竭力與以扶助指導。他對朋友的心。總是熱騰騰的。民國十一年中山先生因遭部下叛變去粵到滬。冬間我父吩咐我代表他去訪問致慰。卓吾是陪着我去的。記得那天傍晚。我二人同車偕往。在衰柳枯桐。斜陽如血。寒鴉噪晚聲中。那莫里愛路的一段。離市稍遠。景物幽絕。入門人接片。隨即引導至樓上中山先生的書室。我先呈上父的手書。並道過訪之意。先生問我父的健康。和南通事業之狀况。欵接我異常眞切。那時我正要出國考察實業。先生指示我中國實業改進之所需。及考察探求的門徑。隨手題了字於所著之英文中國實業建設計畫書。送給我讀。這種提挈後進。誨人不倦的情態。我當時的印象。深刻至今。才相信中山先生的感動力。眞不可思議呀。我認識了一個中國的大人物。是出於卓吾的紹介。這是我一生忘不了的一個紀念。</p>
<p>此次卓吾之死。聽說同鄉中有很憤激的。當然凡是卓吾的朋友。没有一個不該極端憤激的。我也是其中的一個。因憤激而遷怒於大達公司。也是人情之常。我又何嘗不感覺到這次卓吾遭難。是在和我有關係的大達公司的輪船中。我的於邑悲哀。自然格外有難言之痛了。大達公司成立。也近二十年了。從前公司各種組織。異常簡陋。可是營業方面一天總比一天發達。由平穩而進於鞏固。直到前年才正式召集了股東會。組織了董事會。各項章程也訂立頒行組織。也漸漸完備起來。一切都走上了法的軌道。萬想不到今年一年以內。反連出了二件丨大吉大德的災殃。這種求全得毁的因果。恐怕不是人能解答的了。</p>
<h3>老百姓寫給軍人的一封信（下）</h3>
<p>— 老百姓</p>
<p>我們生在這樣不爭氣的時代。誰也不曾萝想過希望你們去侵害鄰國但是捍衛國家。保護人民。却是我們老百姓睡萝中對你們武裝同胞們的痴望。　吉淪入異族之手。你們大概是老百姓的出身。難道武裝起來。愛國心反不及徒手空拳的老百姓嗎。老百姓可憐害羞着。氣憤着都要自殺了。你們呢。</p>
<p>現在黑龍江馬占山將軍孤軍拒敵。在雪地冰天的東北。抱破斧沉舟之志。與暴日周旋。老百姓敬祝馬將軍勝利。確實承認馬將軍的官兵是中國的模範軍人。實在不愧老百姓血汗代價的供養。老百姓此時已一無所有。且將做工得來的工資積下來。連黄烟也不吃。積蓄着寄給馬將軍和他的忠勇武裝同胞。藉致敬意。同時老百姓又有幾個幻想。</p>
<p>㈠假使我老百姓是兵士。一定背了槍到馬將軍部下去帮着殺賊。</p>
<p>㈡假使我老百姓率領着有一兵一卒。不管長官准不准。一定率部投到馬將軍部下去帮着殺賊</p>
<p>㈢假使我老百姓是有地位的軍官。一定盡率所部。到東北去援助馬將軍以壯聲勢。决不空空地打什麼騙人的通電了事。</p>
<p>㈣假使大家都不關痛癢地看着馬將軍和忠勇戰士。無援地被暴日殲滅。黑省再爲暴日佔有。老百姓只有自殺。免得以後再擔負無聊的軍費。</p>
<p>㈤假使老百姓自殺了。許多老百姓都自殺了！因爲不願傭首帖耳地做亡國奴。所以都願自殺丨那時候。恐怕田無人畊。工無人做。不捍衛國家的無用軍人。也没有人供飬了那時候。什麼司令什麼軍長。什麼············？</p>
<p>明知急不擇言。衝撞在所不免。由人毁譽吧。敬祝</p>
<p>中華民國武裝同胞平安　　　　老百姓</p>

<h3>上海之</h3>
<p>汽車事業樂觀　沛</p>
<p>▲一九三一年亦稱不惡</p>
<p>再過一日。即爲一九三二年新正元旦矣。在已往一九三零年中。本埠汽車業。據大陸報載稱。各商行大都頗有贏餘。而預料一九三二年之局面。亦甚樂觀。雖除上海以外。全國各地都受政治及經濟上之影響。然一九二一年之後數個月。其汽車營業之繁盛。實爲一九二九年以來所未有云。</p>
<p>本埠各著名汽車商行今年都有贏利。冬至節之紅利。凡職員等大多得分杯羹。即此一端足證樂觀之說。爲非不確也。據云此項分紅之舉。實爲一九二八年來之破題兒第一朝。而在一九二八年之前。亦未聞有此盛舉云。</p>
<p>除别克新車業已到滬外。其他牌子之一九三二年模型新汽車。均在行程之中。並未到滬。雖到亦祇係少數。本埠汽車經售商對於未來前途。大多抱有非常奢望。至於新車遲緩。但各經售商現已有銷路極旺之事實可以證明。不論其爲一九三一年之模型。或預將一九三二年者出售也。出租汽車業於一九三一年中。成績甚爲可觀。較之往年大有起色。雖有新開之出租汽車行多家。以代營業失敗者之地方。然數家大出租汽車行之營業。實稱不惡。故紅利之分發爲數殊豐耳。出租汽車行之取消簽字欠賬制度。對於其獲利方面大有增進。最近滬上各出租汽車行大多實行現錢交易制。營業方面大爲穩妥。且如是則記賬收欵及各種費用均可撙節。因之一九三一年之壞賬其數祇及一九三零年之半數也。此係就華洋各出租汽車行一體而言。據大多數之車行計劃。一九三二年將添置新車及各種塡舊物品甚多。以謀出租汽車事業之進展云。</p>
<p>滬上出售配件之各汽車商行。其營業之發達亦較往年爲盛。車輪胎商不問其爲美國。英國或屬於法國者。其售出之數目均極衆多。此實由於滬上置備汽車者日增月盛。故而配件商家之營業乃大盛也。電池營業亦以本年之營業爲最佳。</p>
<p>本埠汽車經售商。鑒於上海購買汽車者日多。而市內交通及路政亦日就改善。故於汽車事業之發展。前途極爲樂觀。雖然。其中大都爲頭腦冷靜者流。當不致徒然以喜悅呈於面上。其所持者乃謂一九三二年上海人之購買汽車者當更多耳。舊車賣買市塲。近來亦極發達。邇以新車上市此項營業又極活躍矣。</p>

<h3>Military Attaches from Various Countries</h3>
<h3>Investigate and Report the Current Situation in the Jinggou Area</h3>
<p>Japanese Military Circles Express Dissatisfaction</p>
<p>Beijing: Jinzhou telegram: After the Japanese army captured Dawa, the situation in the Jinggou area suddenly became tense. Military attaches from various countries are now sending telegrams to their respective embassies, reporting the serious current situation in the Jinggou area. (Special dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Japanese Ministry of the Army is very dissatisfied with the attitude of the foreign military observers in Jinzhou and is considering the possibility of requesting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to protest to the countries concerned. A few days ago, military circles here expressed the opinion that what the foreign observers are doing does more harm than good. Their presence in Jinzhou only makes Zhang Xueliang more determined not to withdraw his troops, because Zhang Xueliang believes that with the observers present, the Japanese army will not take any action. Today, the Ministry of the Army is taking further measures and issued an article to the press in the afternoon, deeply criticizing the actions taken by the observers, and saying that the observers were deceived by the Chinese authorities and issued reports about the situation that were misleading to the public. The Japanese military authorities now have irrefutable evidence proving that Chinese soldiers are assisting Manchurian bandits and irregular troops in carrying out large-scale acts of sabotage against the Japanese army, but the observers have never mentioned these important points in their reports, which is very regrettable.

<h3>Japanese Troops in Heihe</h3>

<p>Harbin: More than a thousand cavalry of the National Salvation Army were discovered in Yalu County, north of Heihe, circling toward Heihe. The Japanese troops in Heihe went to defend on the 27th. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<h3>Our Country Reports to the League of Nations</h3>

(Photo taken in Nanjing by Guanghua)</p>
<p>The first plenary session has been in session for a week, since the 20th of this month. During this week, we have held two preparatory meetings and four formal meetings, and we have achieved very satisfactory results. Not only do our comrades feel comforted, but also the spirit of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen, seeing that our conference has achieved such good results, will also be very comforted. In the past few years, due to various disputes among the comrades of our party, everyone was scattered in all directions, and there were no good opportunities to gather together to discuss the great plans of the party and the country. Today, we have finally been able to fulfill our wishes. Comrades from all directions, east, west, south, and north, have come to Beijing one after another to gather together and decide on the future direction of the party and the country. This good phenomenon has never happened before, and it can be said that no plenary session since the reorganization of our party has been able to show such a great spirit of love, sincerity, unity, and consistency as this one. This time, not only can our comrades console themselves, but we also express our greatest respect for the sincerity of the comrades who came to Beijing this time to save the party and save the country. This time, the comrades in the party were able to achieve the result of sincerity and unity, and we cannot but think of the expression of this great spirit of Chiang Kai-shek. Without the existence of such a great spirit of Chiang, it would not have been possible to move all the comrades and give everyone such a good opportunity to gather together. Therefore, when we look back on the good results and satisfactory results of the meetings in the past few days, we cannot but express our greatest admiration for Chiang. The various hopes of the people that disappointed the general public in the past have been discussed through this plenary session to open a new era for the party, so that all comrades in the party can concentrate their intelligence and ability to lead the people and work hard for the national revolution to complete the great cause that the late Premier has not yet seen. This is the greatest mission that the comrades of our party will shoulder in the future. This important mission can no longer be borne by any other group or force other than the Kuomintang. At this time of national crisis, the internal and external difficulties are unprecedented, but the general public, although they have been disappointed in our party in the past, our party will now hold on to the greatest determination to enrich the revolutionary forces and be the vanguard of the people, meeting the expectations of the people, and doing our best to cope with the unprecedented national crisis externally, and doing our best to relieve the suffering of the 400 million compatriots internally. These two important tasks still require the continued and unremitting efforts of the comrades in our party. Therefore, the comrades of our party feel the importance of their responsibilities and should thoroughly awaken themselves, with a sincere and open mind, loving each other, trusting and helping each other, and working together for the nation and the people. Even if the methods used in the past were not correct and we could not complete political tutelage in the shortest period of time, this is a mistake that we must bear, but it is not the mistake of any one person, it is the mistake of all the comrades in our party. Then we should have the self-awareness of self-reflection. Secondly, we must understand that the reason why the revolutionary work cannot be completed is due to the incorrect methods. In the future, we should improve our methods, correct our mistakes, and make new efforts to complete our mission. This is not only related to the future of our party, but also to the survival of the Chinese nation. If, from today onwards, everyone cannot correct the previous mistakes, dare to change the strings and open a new life for the party, then the people's faith in the party will be completely lost. If our party loses its position of leading the people, the result will be that our party will perish, and at the same time, if the party perishes, the country will have no way out. Therefore, the work in the future, in simple terms, is the work of saving the party and saving the country. Because we want to save the country, we must enrich the party and save the party first. The purpose of saving the party is to save the country. The mission of saving the country is in the party. Using the party to save the country is not to use the party to dominate the country and control the country, so that the Chinese nation will forever live under the political tutelage of the party. It is to realize constitutional government, so that the people can exercise direct civil rights and complete democratic politics. Political tutelage is only a revolutionary means, and constitutional government is the purpose of the revolution. This is the only mission of our party, and the responsibility of our party members is so important. From today onwards, in front of the portrait of the late Premier, we will make the greatest determination, correct the mistakes of the past, and make new efforts to complete the unfinished business of the late Premier and achieve the goal of saving the party and saving the country. This is the sincere meaning that the brothers have contributed at the closing of the conference today, and I hope to get the sincere adoption of the central comrades and all the comrades in the party. After Sun Ke finished his speech, Yu Youren read the conference declaration, and then Central Committee member Feng Yuxiang gave a speech, saying, Fellow comrades, at this time when the country is in crisis, the danger of the country has reached the point of extreme. The brothers are speaking in this grand and solemn hall, and I feel endless feelings. In the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, the late Premier repeatedly wrote letters and entrusted friends to show me, just to make the independence, freedom, and equality of China realized as soon as possible. This kind of last words is still in my heart. The greatness of the late Premier's personality and the bright aspirations can move people's hearts and achieve great results. However, unfortunately, one event followed another, such as the "May 3rd" incident, the "anti-Chinese" incident in Mexico, the "anti-Chinese incident" in Korea, and the "Wanbaoshan Massacre", which are all enough to make us extremely heartbroken. Unexpectedly, in the midst of our extreme heartbreak, Japan forcibly occupied our three northeastern provinces with military force. The area of Liaoning is 866,000 square miles, with a population of more than 14 million. The area of Jilin is 880,000 square miles, with a population of more than 15 million. The area of Heilongjiang is 1.76 million square miles, with a population of more than 4 million. In a few days, they were all forcibly seized by Japanese imperialists. This makes us even more heartbroken. Therefore, now we must realize the last words that the late Premier showed us, that is, to make China escape from the status of a semi-colony and enter the realm of independence and freedom, and at the same time make democratic politics realized as soon as possible. What should we do? In the past year, although the brothers have been living in the mountains, I have never forgotten this responsibility. Recently, I received an electric call from the Central Committee comrades to come to Beijing to attend the conference. The brothers thought that the country was in crisis, and how could I be at ease? Therefore, I came to Beijing to meet with you and discuss the efforts to be made in the future. The brothers have constantly thought that if we want to overcome the current national crisis, we can only unite and consistently resist foreign aggression, as Mr. Zhesheng and Mr. Youren said. In other words, we must be of one heart and one mind and jointly resist foreign aggression. We can only repent and confess before the spirit of the late Premier, correct our past mistakes, and earnestly take responsibility for the country and the nation, so that we can be worthy of the general public and restore the credibility of our party. People like Mr. Wang and Mr. Hu are all great revolutionaries and believers of the late Premier. We look forward to everyone rising up and jointly planning to save the country. There is also my sworn brother, Chiang Kai-shek. We once wrote a oath in Zhengzhou that the seas would run dry and the rocks would rot and never change. Although he has his shortcomings, he also has his strengths. Therefore, we also hope that he can come out and do his best to meet the national crisis together. As for this time the brothers came to Beijing, it was not for anything I wanted, but because the brothers received letters from young people in the mountains every day, saying to the brothers that at this time of national crisis, they could not be alone in the mountains writing, painting, and cultivating themselves. The brothers were compelled by their own responsibilities and came to Beijing to participate in the conference. Today, what the brothers have contributed to everyone is completely out of the brothers' sincerity and sincerity, and I hope that the compatriots and comrades of the whole country will correct me. After Feng finished his speech, Committee Member Li Jishen gave a speech. (Special dispatch on the 29th)</p>

<h3>Capital Peace Conference</h3>
<h3>Urging Chiang, Wang, and Hu to Go to Beijing</h3>
<p>Nanjing. The Preparatory Committee for the Peace and Unification Support and the Overseeing of All Central Committee Members Sharing National Hardships Conference from all circles in the capital, Nanjing, concluded on the 29th and sent a telegram to the three Central Committee members, Chiang, Wang, and Hu, urging them to immediately preside over the central government. The telegram stated, "The peace and unification that the people of the country have been calling for for three months has now finally been realized. The people of the country are fortunate that you are gathering together to plan and jointly alleviate the national crisis. However, since the opening of the First Plenary Session, there have only been reports of your illnesses and leaves of absence, which is strangely coincidental and has led to rumors. Moreover, the Japanese bandits are becoming increasingly urgent and plotting against us every moment. We earnestly request that you immediately travel to Beijing to preside over the central government and reassure the people. If Wang and Hu are still unwell, please follow the spirit of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen's dedication and strive to make the journey to Beijing for recuperation. Public opinion is anxiously awaiting this, not just for a day or two. We look up to your arrival with great anticipation." (29th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<p>This Year</p>
<p>The Economy of the Past Year (Part 1)</p>
<p>The Chinese economy of 1931. In terms of time, it is a prelude to the unfolding of history, closely following 1930. In terms of horizontal space, it is an inseparable unit connected to the entire global economic network. Therefore, here, we must disjointedly explain the Chinese economy from the perspective of 1931 in time and China in space. This task can be said to be "unavoidably clumsy."</p>
<p>However, the Chinese economy has its own characteristics within the entire global economic network. It has its own imbalances. Moreover, based on the laws of dialectics in time, the Chinese economy of 1931 is also different from that of 1930 in the surging and ever-changing torrent of the entire world economy. This is why we are analyzing and narrating the Chinese economy of the past year here.</p>
<p>This kind of analysis and narration is not easy. Because, first, in China, there are no statistical figures at all. Not to mention this year, there are no figures to use as a reference even from ten years ago. Second, the nature of the Chinese economy is currently a mysterious question that everyone is arguing and debating. "The wise see wisdom, and the benevolent see benevolence." Therefore, it is difficult for our analysis and explanation here to be accurate. Therefore, we can only narrate the new facts that occurred in the Chinese economic system in 1931 within the possible scope, and at the same time, we can only point out the direction of the turning point of the Chinese economy in 1931 within the scope of our possible understanding.</p>
<p>This year, the world capitalist economic panic shook the structure of world capitalism with unprecedented shock. The decline of agriculture, the decline of industry, and the reduction of trade all prove that world capitalism is on the verge of collapse. Precisely because of the decline of the world economy and the shaking of the entire capitalist economic system, the Chinese economy has suffered a huge impact in its convulsions and has shown obvious changes. In other words, the Chinese economy is increasingly declining and becoming increasingly colonized. The Chinese masses are increasingly trapped in a deep abyss of misery and suffering.</p>
<p>The Phenomena Shown in the Chinese Economy in the Past Year</p>
<p>(1) The collapse of the rural economy is accelerating. Since the forces of imperialism extended into Chinese rural areas, the Chinese rural economy has been in the process of collapse and decay every day. In addition, the years of war, famine, and banditry have further accelerated the speed of the collapse process. Especially this year, due to three important reasons: (a) the decline of the world economy; (b) the unprecedented floods in eighteen provinces; and (c) the expansion of the Communist Party's harassment areas, the acceleration of the collapse of the agricultural economy is particularly significant. Because of the decline of the world economy, the low world industrial production, and the sharp drop in agricultural product prices, Chinese agricultural products have been quickly squeezed out by other capitalist countries in the world market. For example, Chinese tea has been squeezed out by Indian tea. The tea stockpiled in Shanghai is simply not inquired about. For example, Chinese silk has been squeezed out by Japanese raw silk and rayon. According to the market price of silk in June this year, it is still necessary to lose more than two hundred taels per package even if it is sold at the cost price. Moreover, the transactions are few, and the market situation is extremely bleak. The silk producing area (Zhejiang) even has a plan to establish a rayon factory because of this. If we look at the export of special products from the Northeast, the total amount of transportation from October last year to March this year is significantly reduced compared with the same period last year. The difference in soybeans alone is nearly 500,000 tons. The amount of sorghum exported from Dalian in March this year was 11,279 tons, a decrease of 156 tons compared with the same month last year. The banks such as Heilongjiang Guangxin Company and Jilin Yongheng Official Bank have about 400,000 tons of soybeans in storage. Seventy percent of the soybeans in the Harbin area are in the hands of the banks. The rise and fall of prices are naturally manipulated by the bankers. The sharp reduction in agricultural product exports is one of the factors promoting the decline of the agricultural economy. Due to the unprecedented floods in eighteen provinces this year, Chinese agriculture has suffered an unprecedented disaster. Only the reported losses in the eight provinces of Shandong, Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang have been statistically analyzed. The affected area is 141.7 (unit: million acres). The number of affected farmers is 8.579 (unit: thousand households). The amount of lost rice is 900 million catties, which is about 600 million catties of net rice. The amount of sorghum and millet converted into net powder is about 100 million catties. Each person needs about 400 catties of rice and flour per year, which is enough to feed 18 million people for the whole year. The value of agricultural product losses is estimated at 45.66 (unit: million yuan). In fact, there are a total of eighteen provinces in the affected area, and the number of affected people is at least 50 million. As for the losses of cotton, wheat, rice, and various agricultural products, and the total losses of farmland, farm tools, and houses, although there are no statistics at present, the numbers are always surprisingly large. This is still in terms of the direct losses suffered from the floods. As for the farmland destroyed by the floods and unable to be repaired, the farm tools and seeds are gone. There is no land to cultivate and no seeds to sow next year. Driven by hunger and cold, the young and strong are displaced, and the old and young starve to death. The indirect losses are even impossible to calculate. Currently, the rice, wheat flour, and all the miscellaneous grains we eat are all imported from foreign countries. For example, the import of rice in Shanghai from January to July 1930 has reached more than 70 million taels. Flour factories in Tianjin, Shanghai, and the three northeastern provinces all use foreign wheat to make flour. The large amount of wheat borrowed from the United States after the floods is a well-known fact. The cotton and silk fabrics we wear are also imported from foreign countries. Many other essential raw materials are also dependent on foreign imports. Our clothing, food, housing, and transportation can be summed up in one sentence: Our living materials are entirely in the hands of foreigners. This proves that due to the impact of the famine, the amount of agricultural production in our country has been reduced to the extreme. This is another factor promoting the decline of the agricultural economy. Due to the expansion of the areas harassed by the Communist Party and bandits, many places cannot be cultivated. For example, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Anhui, and Fujian are almost the entire province. For example, Sichuan, Henan, Guangxi, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Guangdong also have many counties that are areas harassed by the Communist Party. In this vast area, with the government troops' encirclement and suppression and the Communist army's guerrilla warfare, the people are all fleeing and the fields are all deserted. Naturally, there is no agricultural production to speak of. In addition, the harassment of bandits in Shandong, Henan, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Suiyuan, and the three northeastern provinces also makes farmers displaced and agriculture deserted. Although the expansion of the power of the Communist Party and bandits is the result of the bankruptcy of the rural economy, their harassment and guerrilla warfare have become the third factor promoting the accelerated collapse of the rural economy. In addition, due to the backwardness of agricultural technology, the existence of feudal exploitation relations in rural areas, the heavy taxes, the exploitation of military officers and officials, the exploitation of commerce, and the large-scale destruction of the domestic transportation system, farmers are in absolute poverty. After taking away the chemical quality in the land, there is absolutely no power to replenish fertilizer. The Shaanxi-Gansu area has become barren land. Even the virgin land in the Northeast is becoming increasingly barren due to excessive exploitation. The reduction in the amount of agricultural production is a natural phenomenon. This is another important factor promoting the collapse of the agricultural economy. In summary, due to the decline of the world economy, the nationwide disasters and man-made disasters, the suction of imperialism, and the exploitation of commercial capital, high-interest loans, tenancy, and taxes, the agricultural economy in our country has reached a dead end this year. It has reached the extreme of bankruptcy. The masses of the people are simply buried in the hell on earth of deep water and scorching fire. There is nowhere to die and no way to survive.</p>

<h3>Japanese Military Headquarters Stationed in Tianjin</h3>
<p>Transporting Military Supplies to Yuguan</p>
<p>Tianjin. The Japanese military headquarters stationed in Tianjin dispatched two Japanese soldiers to the East Station at 5 p.m. on the 29th, demanding a 40-ton covered wagon to transport military supplies to Shanhaiguan. The stationmaster refused to provide the vehicle because of the telegram from the Foreign Affairs Committee and the resolution of the Special Party Department of the Beining Railway, which both prohibited the transportation of Japanese soldiers and military supplies. The Japanese soldiers were furious, pulled out their pistols, loaded them with bullets, and threatened to kill the stationmaster. After being persuaded, they called the railway bureau for instructions. The bureau, fearing an incident, approved the allocation of a covered wagon. On the evening of the 28th, the Japanese soldiers loaded ammunition into the car and scheduled to transport it to Shanhaiguan on the morning of the 30th. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Cruel and Poisonous Methods</h3>
<p>Nanjing. The Ministry of Railways received a telegram from the Beining Railway yesterday, reporting that the Japanese have recently been using the pretext of epidemic prevention in the Northeast to administer injections indiscriminately. Two people who were summoned to Qing by Commander Shen Honglie were both injected. Fortunately, there were Japanese friends on the South Manchurian Railway car who immediately sent two boxes of antidote, which were taken and immediately relieved the symptoms. According to the investigation, there were two types of needles, one to anesthetize and make people unconscious, and the other a poisonous needle that would cause death after a hundred days. This is truly inhuman. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Li Jishen Discusses</h3>
<p>The Issue of Dividing Military Regions</p>
<p>Nanjing. Li Jishen said that it is not impossible to divide the country into military regions for temporary adaptation to the facts. However, if the division is permanent, I am afraid that it will easily lead to the abuses of de facto separatism. We should not forget the lessons of the past. If there are other methods to prevent abuses, then it should be discussed separately. The number of divisions that should be maintained in our country's army should be determined according to the size of the national defense area, and should be suitable for the supply and demand of national finance and talents. However, the number of troops in our country in recent years has exceeded the records of general countries, and in terms of actual strength, it is not as good as any one country. The reason is that it is caused by years of war and lack of training. Therefore, the key to rectification in the future lies in cutting down the old and weak, earnestly training, and determining funding to save the accumulated abuses. As for the regulations on the number of divisions, it should be changed with the times and the environment. For example, the current foreign troubles are urgent, so it should not be compared with peacetime. Should national defense forces and local forces be distinguished? I think it is not necessary to set up local forces. If there are matters such as suppressing the communists, the national defense forces should be responsible. In the future, the public security of various provinces should be (1) training good police, (2) organizing genuine militias, so that the people have the strength to defend themselves, and are people in peacetime and soldiers in wartime. The people can understand their own interests, so they will not be used by improper forces. What I advocate to cut down are infantry. Regarding ordnance troops such as artillery, cavalry, and baggage trains, on the one hand, they should be improved, and on the other hand, they should still be expanded. The expansion of the navy and air force is of course a matter of national survival, but it should be cultivated as much as possible without hindering the scope of national finance. For the sake of humanity and the health of the army, the lives of soldiers must be improved in the future. In the future, the increase or decrease of troops will depend on the legislative branch, in other words, it can be said to depend on the people, because the future legislative branch is composed of elected members, which is very consistent in terms of both reason and law.

<h3>Chen Mingshu Reports</h3>
<p>Thorough Investigation of the Student Movement</p>

The National Government Standing Committee has resolved to dismiss Chen Xizeng, the Director of the Public Security Bureau. The issue of responsibility for the Municipal Party Department has been sent to the Central Party Department for review. The content of the report is a summary of reports from various parties and investigation of the actual situation. It generally states that the majority of the students in this incident were motivated by patriotism. However, in this complex society, it is difficult to guarantee that a small number of dangerous elements did not take the opportunity to agitate. But the crux of the matter was the conflict between Wang Fusheng and the students. According to general public opinion in Shanghai, the Municipal Party Department and the Public Security Bureau's handling of the matter was not without flaws. As for the destruction of the railway in Zhenru, according to the investigation report, it is inevitable that communist elements attempted to expand the incident, but since no perpetrators were caught on the spot, it was difficult to obtain evidence afterwards.

<p>Important Foreign Telegrams</p>
<h3>Utida, President of the South Manchuria Railway, Discusses</h3>
<p>The Plan to Develop Eastern Provinces</p>
<p>Stating that the focus should be on overall, active development of agriculture and industry</p>
<p>Changes Are Coming to the Heads of Japanese Colonies</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 29th - Utida, President of the South Manchuria Railway, who arrived in Tokyo after contacting government officials and the military regarding the new leadership, said about the economic development of Manchuria: In the future, the colonial policy in Manchuria and Mongolia should not be as lenient as before. We must focus on the overall situation, establish long-term plans. Manchuria alone cannot support a population of 50,000 with industry and commerce. We must move two or three million farmers from the mainland to compete with Chinese farmers on their own initiative, with the determination to win. It is also necessary for entrepreneurs other than the South Manchuria Railway to actively invest in commerce and industry and compete with the South Manchuria Railway. Manchurian undertakings should not be entrusted solely to the South Manchuria Railway. In the future, the South Manchuria Railway must be a purely railway company, and other undertakings must be made independent.</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 29th - 1. Inoue Yasunari is the most highly rumored successor to Governor-General Ota of Taiwan. 2. Kawai Isoo, a general, has been decided upon for Governor-General of Korea, originally promoted by Mizuno Rentaro. Kuwayama Tetsuo is most likely to become Director-General of Political Affairs. 3. The incumbent to Kantō Governor Tsukamoto is being considered by Hata Yoshiaki of the Ministry of Colonial Affairs. 4. The government hopes that Utida, President of the South Manchuria Railway, will resign voluntarily. Katsuta Kazue is being considered to fill the position. However, the Privy Council and the military still advocate for his retention. Vice President Eguchi Sadaharu, originally from the Mitsubishi family, is also unwilling to resign due to his close relationship with Utida.</p>
<h3>Gandhi Encourages the People</h3>
<p>Prepare to Fight to the End</p>
<p>Not Afraid of Bullets, Only Seeking Freedom</p>
<p>British Indian Military Police Suppress the Red Shirts</p>
<p>British Prime Minister Expresses Regret for the Future of India</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Bombay, 28th - Gandhi spoke to the crowd here tonight, saying: "If the struggle is inevitable, then I ask you to prepare for the struggle. I will not give up my desire to save the country from great calamities. But if there is no hope, then I will not hesitate to ask you to undergo some trials."</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Bombay, 28th - Gandhi told people here today that in the last struggle, Indians resisted with sticks, but in this struggle, they may resist with bullets. If the recently promulgated laws are repealed, then he can persuade the All-India Congress to cooperate with the Round Table Conference. But based on what he heard after arriving in Bombay, unless he completely loses his self-respect, there is little hope for cooperation.</p>
<p>▲ Havas, Bombay, 28th - Gandhi remains silent every Sunday. However, due to incessant inquiries from reporters, he made an exception to speak, saying that he would not make any statements until he had met with members of the National Congress. As for the various orders recently issued by the government, they are clearly provoking the National Congress. Gandhi's assistant, Vidarbha Bader, said that India is moving straight towards revolution, and a second struggle to seek freedom is truly unavoidable. He also said that even if the Round Table Conference is reopened, there is no hope of success. Ba's also said that the boycott movement against British goods should be expanded. The London Conference and Gandhi's travels in London did not necessarily increase the prestige of the National Congress. This is clearly visible.</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>▲ Havas, Bombay, 28th - Tomorrow, Gandhi will meet with members of the National Congress. It is generally believed that the Congress Committee intends to put pressure on Gandhi to re-engage in the non-resistance movement to restrain the government.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, North-West Frontier Province, 29th - Disturbances have occurred repeatedly in North-West Frontier Province over the past few days, some of which are quite serious. Military police clashed with Red Shirts, resulting in many deaths and injuries. Today, some Red Shirts, dressed in white and wearing flower crowns, shouted revolutionary slogans and entered the police station in formation to request to be arrested. This morning, the Red Shirts in the Gandar area held two meetings, both of which were dispersed by the military police. Twenty people were injured in the first incident, and four died and eight were injured in the second. The area is now calm. The total number of people arrested in the Northwest Frontier Province has now reached 763. The situation in North-West Frontier Province City has improved, and British troops have been withdrawn.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 28th - A Reuters reporter visited British Prime Minister MacDonald at Chequers to inquire about the recurrence of disturbances in India. MacDonald said that the government had given India more evidence than before, indicating that Britain was prepared to expand Indian freedom with Indian leaders. Now, rioters are trying to destroy their opportunities, which is very difficult. All Indians who care about their motherland should, like the British government, express regret for the disturbances occurring throughout India. This type of event does not represent oppressed Indians striving for freedom, but is part of an ominous movement that undermines Indian progress. Over the past few weeks, agitators in India have sought to expand their propaganda of not paying rent, and the Red Shirts, composed of radicals, have been particularly active in causing trouble.</p>
<h3>Sawada Travels to Moscow via Berlin</h3>
<p>▲ Kokumin, Berlin, 29th - The new Japanese Foreign Minister Sawada and his wife arrived quietly in Berlin this morning on their return from Paris.

<p>Two Officers Sentenced to Imprisonment</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Berlin, 29th - Two officers and one crew member of the German merchant ship Bremen were sentenced to imprisonment by the court for secretly transporting Chinese into the United States. One Chinese man, Chen Lai, is suspected of being the leader of the smuggling ring, but the court acquitted him due to lack of evidence. It is heard that this ring has branches in New York, Philadelphia, and Sydney, Australia. It was discovered this June when four Chinese were found hidden behind the walls of the reading room on the Bremen ship, leading to the breaking of the smuggling case. These four Chinese each paid a travel fee of $200 USD, hoping to sneak ashore after the ship arrived in New York.</p>
<h3>British Prime Minister Invites French Premier for a Meeting</h3>
<p>Semi-Officially Acknowledged by France</p>
<p>▲ Kokumin, Paris, 29th - The British Prime Minister MacDonald's invitation to French Premier Laval to meet at Chequers has now been semi-officially acknowledged this morning. It is said that MacDonald sent a private letter to Laval about ten days ago, proposing to meet at Chequers sometime next week to discuss all current international issues and express his opinion that in order to reorganize Europe and seek future prosperity, France and Britain need to act jointly and have consistent opinions. He is preparing to lay the foundation for this agreement.</p>
<p>▲ Kokumin, Paris, 29th - Although officials had denied the rumor that French Premier Laval was planning to go to Britain next week, newspapers reported this morning that Laval had definitely arranged to meet the British Prime Minister next week, and said that the Foreign Ministry's denial was worded vaguely and ambiguously.</p>
<h3>London Consols Remain Unchanged</h3>
<p>▲ Kokumin, London, 29th - Consols closed today, both short and long-term, unchanged from yesterday. Short-term at 20 pence, long-term at 20 pence and 1875/10000 pence.</p>

<h3>Jinzhou Situation Increasingly Urgent</h3>
<p>▲ Japanese Army to Forcefully Seize Dawa Railway Station</p>
<p>▲ More Than a Thousand Japanese Soldiers Continue to Arrive in Tianjin</p>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: The Japanese army has decided to attack Jinzhou in order to complete its plan to occupy the three northeastern provinces. The war has already begun. Except for the military deployments between Juliuhe and Xinglongdian on the Beining Railway, there is no tense situation elsewhere. Currently, the intense part of the war is on the Beining branch line from Yingkou to Goubangzi. According to investigations, there are approximately 2,000 Japanese soldiers in Yingkou. On the 23rd of this month, 500 to 600 Japanese infantry soldiers, carrying more than ten artillery pieces, attacked Tianzhuangtai, supported by 400 to 500 cavalry soldiers who attacked along the left side of the railway. Our armored train responded, and both sides fired heavily. The situation was intense, and the roofs of the Tianzhuangtai railway station were completely destroyed. Subsequently, our army urgently dispatched troops from Goubangzi to assist. The Japanese army, unable to withstand the attack, retreated into the town of Tianzhuangtai, which is about seven or eight li from the railway station. The next morning, the Japanese army launched another fierce attack on the Tianzhuangtai railway station, while also dropping bombs from airplanes in Panshan County to disrupt our rear military operations. By 6 p.m., the Tianzhuangtai railway station had been occupied by the Japanese army, and our armored train retreated to defend the Dawa railway station. Both sides suffered casualties in this battle. On the 25th, the Japanese army in Tianzhuangtai clashed with the local militia, resulting in the disarming of a part of the Japanese army, with the militia seizing more than ten artillery pieces and over a hundred rifles. Around noon, the Japanese army again launched a large-scale bombing raid with four or five airplanes one li south of Dawa, dropping more than twenty bombs, which created large craters seven or eight feet deep and ten feet wide. More than ten sections of the railway were destroyed, and our armored train, which was in front, was blocked south of the station. Repairs were urgently dispatched. On the 26th, the Japanese army continued to drop bombs on the Dawa railway station, with each bomb weighing about 120 pounds, totaling twenty bombs, of which six exploded, destroying one train car, in an attempt to destroy the railway outside Panshan County. At the same time, two Japanese planes also flew to Dagushan and Zhangwu County, dropping two bombs in Zhangwu, with unclear losses. It is reported that there are currently 400 to 500 Japanese soldiers with many artillery pieces at the Tianzhuangtai railway station, while our army is firmly defending the Dawa area. In the past two days, the situation on both sides seems to have made no progress. As for the Shanhaiguan area, many Japanese soldiers have continued to arrive, intending to cut off our army's reinforcements to Jinzhou. In Tianjin, more than 1,500 Japanese soldiers have also continued to arrive in the past two days, transported from Tanggu to Tianjin via the Beining Railway on two special trains. The general public believes that the Japanese side is not acting in good faith by increasing its troops so much, and people are panicking. Residents in the Chinese area are again moving to the British and French concessions, and the market has suddenly become tense. It is reported that the Japanese troops coming to Tianjin are part of the Hiroshima Division. After arriving in Tianjin, they immediately entered the Japanese concession, stationed in the Japanese barracks at Haiguang Temple and the old site of Zhangyuan Gongli Hospital. The number of Japanese troops arriving is as follows: (First Batch) Arrived at 12:15 on the 26th, with 550 Japanese soldiers, 50 war horses, 3 steel cannons, 6 machine guns, more than a thousand boxes of ammunition, and hand grenades, supplies, etc. (Second Batch) Arrived at 8:30 a.m. on the 27th, with 350 Japanese soldiers, 4 artillery pieces, more than 100 horses, and 4 supply wagons. (Third Batch) Arrived at 11:15 a.m. on the same day, with 650 Japanese soldiers, 18 machine guns, 4 mortars, 28 horses, and 4 supply wagons. (December 27th)</p>
<p>The Da Mei Evening News reported from Shenyang on the 28th that in recent days, the Japanese have continued to transfer troops from Korea to Liaoning, one after another. It is estimated that the Japanese military strength in the three northeastern provinces has now reached more than 30,000 regular soldiers. In addition, there are more than 3,000 stationed in Tianjin, Shanhaiguan, and Qinhuangdao. It is said that after the Japanese troops were transferred to Liaoning Province, the Japanese troops in Korea have been reduced by half. It is claimed that this increase in troops in Liaoning is due to the inspection results of former Army Minister Nan, who determined that the administrative organs under the Japanese protection were unable to exercise their powers and maintain order, and decided that the entire South Manchuria region would be effectively garrisoned by Japanese troops, thus increasing the military strength by more than double. Today, according to unconfirmed news, the Japanese are also forcibly bringing Puyi from Dalian to Shenyang, attempting to restore the monarchy as soon as possible. Doihara also published a statement in the newspaper today, claiming that he believes the republican government is not suitable for the three northeastern provinces, and that most Manchus support the imperial system. It is clear that the Japanese ronin's plan to restore the monarchy has not died at this time.</p>
<p>Another dispatch stated that the main force of the Japanese army departed from Tianzhuangtai at 9:00 this morning and arrived at Dawa at 4:00 p.m., a distance of about fifteen miles. They will camp in Dawa tonight. Their commander, Tamon, also went to Dawa this afternoon to direct the military operations. A Chinese armored train north of Dawa was surrounded and bombed by the Japanese army, and the railway tracks were destroyed. Only the locomotive was still standing on the tracks. According to reports obtained by neutral parties tonight, the previous reports of a major battle between Chinese and Japanese troops near Futianzhuangtai are exaggerated. There are very few Chinese soldiers in that area, while the Japanese army launched a large-scale attack with all kinds of troops, supplemented by the latest aircraft. Among them, four aircraft were newly purchased by the Japanese army from abroad, and they just arrived in Dalian last week. They are three-engine Martin-style bombers, each capable of carrying six 500-pound bombs, with extreme bombing power. It is rumored that the current Japanese plan is to reach Goubangzi on the Yingkou-Goubangzi line by December 31, and then join the Japanese army on the Beining Railway before advancing towards Jinzhou. The Japanese army on the Beining line may begin their attack tomorrow. There is also a third route of Japanese army that will depart from a certain location along the South Manchuria Railway north of Shenyang, taking the road through Fakumen, with Zhangwu, which connects Tongliao and Dagushan, as their target.</p>

After Wang returned to Xuzhou that evening, he immediately sent Zhou Chuanduo to Fengxian on the 27th to investigate everything so that he could report and handle the matter. According to personnel who recently fled from Fengcheng, Zhang Zhankui has appointed division commander Yang Tian as the city defense commander in the city, and accused the county party secretary, Dong Yuqiao, of having reactionary tendencies, inciting the police force, and disrupting the rear. Dong and the police chief, Zhu Dundian, were both shackled and imprisoned. Liu Yantian, assistant to the first district office, Liu Zhonghou, chief of the general affairs section of the county government, Lu Jianhua, and Ren Kuizhou, chief inspector of the public security bureau, were also arrested one after another. All public funds from various agencies were withdrawn. Outside the city, there were war cries and sentries were stationed for defense. Today (28th), another letter arrived from Fengcheng stating that the county magistrate, Yang Liangye, has been released, but is still being monitored by personnel sent by Zhang Zhankui, and his actions are not free. In addition, among the detained personnel, except for Dong Yuqiao, who is still under heavy guard with shackles at the division headquarters, all others have been released. Zhang Zhankui announced on the 26th that Dong was suspected of being reactionary and was therefore being severely guarded. The chief of public security, Dong Yushu, the head of the farmers' association, Peng Shiheng, and the head of the construction bureau, Feng Shouxin, have successively arrived in Xuzhou. Yesterday, they paid a visit to Wang Jun. Subsequently, personnel from Fengyi elected Peng Shiheng, Feng Shouxin, Dong Yushu, Dong Xueshan, president of the education association, and Zhang Zhixuan, deputy police captain, to go south to Nanjing and Zhenjiang today to report to the central government and the provincial government and request handling of the matter. The following is the record of the telegram from County Magistrate Yang Liang to the provincial government: "To Governor Gu, Civil Affairs Department Zhao Junjian of Zhenjiang Provincial Government, although the Cavalry Third Division, due to the slow fundraising in the locality, a change occurred. One day at noon, Division Commander Zhang Zhankui ordered Adjutant Wen Mingxi to lead a team of pistol and broadsword-wielding soldiers to riot, first cutting off the telegraph lines and confiscating the firearms of the public security bureau police and district offices. The party headquarters, county government, and affiliated agencies were all looted. The treasury silver was swept away, and tax registration records and various archives were scattered and lost. Officials and soldiers barely escaped with their lives. The county seal was seized and returned the next day. Myself, Lu Jianhua, chief of the general affairs section, Ren Kuizhou, chief inspector of the public security bureau, Zhu Dundian, captain, and all members of the party headquarters were shackled, imprisoned, or detained at the division headquarters, subjected to all kinds of beatings and insults, which I cannot bear to describe. Although I and Section Chief Lu have been released, we are still under surveillance. Now we are forced to issue a notice stating that Committee Member Dong is extremely cruel and more brutal than the Japanese. The local order has not yet been restored. Myself and my colleagues in the party and government are like prisoners awaiting death. The situation is dangerous. Details will be reported in a separate document. I urgently request a speedy rescue, Yang Liang kowtows in gratitude."</p>
<h3>Measures for Reorganizing the Business Tax in Jiangsu Province</h3>
<p>▲ Temporarily Handle According to the Tax Rate Set by the Ministry</p>
<p>▲ Tax Payments Are Directly Collected by the Government</p>
<p>When the business tax in Jiangsu Province was first levied, the industry associations of each county mostly determined the amount of tax to be paid. If the tax rate was above 2/1000, it was uniformly collected at 2/1000, and paid quarterly each year. Since the levy, various counties have been unable to pay quarterly due to business conditions or the impact of floods. The counties affected by the floods north of the Yangtze River have not yet begun to levy, resulting in financial difficulties for the provincial treasury. On the 3rd of this month, the provincial government convened representatives from the chambers of commerce of various counties and experts to the province for a meeting, intending to revise the tax rate in the province in accordance with the Business Tax Law of the Legislative Yuan. However, because the chambers of commerce of various counties requested that the tax be levied according to the tax rate set by the ministry and that the revision be delayed, the 460th provincial government meeting passed reorganization measures. From January 1 of next year, the tax assessment system will be abolished, and the tax will be directly collected by the government. The following is the record of the reorganization measures: (1) The implementation of the Business Tax Law of the Legislative Yuan will be extended again from January of next year, and will temporarily be handled according to the tax rate stipulated by the Ministry of Finance. (2) The tax payments for the summer, autumn, and winter seasons of the 20th year must be collected and reported in full within the year to close the accounts. (3) From January of the 21st year, all taxes assessed by chambers of commerce and public associations will be abolished, and the government will take back the collection and directly collect taxes from the stores. (4) From January of the 21st year, the county bureaus handling the business tax should have the public security bureau assign a certain number of police officers to assist in the investigation and collection. First-class county bureaus are assigned twelve officers, second-class county bureaus are assigned eight officers, and third-class county bureaus are assigned four officers. The original salaries will be paid from the business tax revenue. (5) From January of the 21st year, the turnover and capital should be reinvestigated and accurately reported to the department by March 15. For this investigation, each bureau should be responsible for sending personnel to fill out the declaration forms by household, and should not entrust public associations or district offices to handle it on their behalf. (6) For stores that use turnover as a standard, they should submit the business records for the 20th year during the investigation and report according to the annual turnover. For stores that use capital as a standard, they should submit the business contract documents during the investigation and report according to the capital stated in the contract. If there is any objection to the investigation, the evaluation committee will retrieve the records and contracts for review and decision. (7) The retrieval of records and contracts and the organization of the evaluation committee must be implemented from the 21st year, and the county bureaus should uniformly comply with and handle it. (8) The separate taxation of wholesale and retail sales has many malpractices and is not allowed by the Business Tax Law. From the 21st year, taxes should be collected in accordance with the regulations. (9) Regardless of the head office or branch office, the business operator in the location should pay taxes according to the rate. If they use the establishment of the head office or branch office in other provinces or cities as an excuse to avoid taxes and refuse to pay, their business should be immediately suspended. (10) Since the tax rate will not be changed temporarily, it should be verified and collected in accordance with the original tax rate set by the Ministry of Finance. No further avoidance or arbitrary reduction is allowed. Violators will be punished in accordance with the penalty rules, and the director of the bureau will be deemed to have violated the law and will be severely dealt with. (11) Taxes should be collected directly by household and receipts should be issued by household. The county bureaus should submit the receipts to the finance department for review on a quarterly basis. No general borrowing or advances from chambers of commerce and public associations, or general collection on their behalf, without issuing receipts, should be allowed, so that tax payments cannot be checked. Violators should be severely punished. (12) From the 21st year, special commissioners will be appointed to go to various county bureaus to supervise and inspect. If any false investigations or declarations, or arbitrary changes in tax rates are found, the director of the bureau will be held responsible. (13) The bureau officials are responsible for both investigation and tax collection, and their regular expenses should be increased accordingly. First-class special bureaus may extract 10% of the actual amount collected as collection expenses. Those with extra revenue may extract 20% of the collection expenses as a reward. The regulations for second-class bureaus and below, and county bureaus that also handle the tax, are listed separately.</p>
<p>Local Communications</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Merchants Voluntarily Seal Up Japanese Goods: Since the violent actions of the Japanese, all circles in this county have been actively carrying out economic severance. The various trade associations believe that sealing up Japanese goods is a natural duty for merchants, and the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of this county has also repeatedly urged this. However, as the end of the year approaches, the stores are busy, and the County Chamber of Commerce has reviewed various relationships. It has been decided that February 6th of next year will be the date for unanimously sealing up Japanese goods. At that time, the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association will also be invited to seal them up to show solemnity.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Donggangjing Capsizes a Patrol Boat: The Thirteenth Water Public Security Team stationed in Changshu received a telegram on the 27th of this month from Shen, the district chief of the Third Water Public Security District of Suzhou, stating that bandits have recently been appearing in Yangcheng Lake and ordering team leader Li to go there to await orders. Yang Qingjiu, the team leader of the Thirteenth Team, immediately led his subordinates with six patrol boats towed by a gasoline boat to Suzhou. Unexpectedly, while traveling near Donggangjing in Yuanhetang, patrol boat number six capsized suddenly due to the towing cable being loose and the rudder being unstable. All the firearms and team members in the boat fell into the river. At that time, they immediately stopped the tow and tried to rescue them. Fortunately, there were many people, and the capsized boat was rescued and the team members were rescued. However, the team members on the capsized boat were unable to salvage the firearms that day because it was late. They began to salvage them the next morning.</p>
<p>Old Case of a Large Number of District Chiefs Gambling with Prostitutes Brought Up Again: Wu Xinheng, the first district chief, Shen Changjun, the sixth district chief, and Yang Zhaoji, the eighth district chief of this county, gambled with prostitutes on November 5th at No. 7 Back Street, and were arrested after being reported. Later, Wu and others all used aliases and managed to escape. Only one person, using the alias Shen Shoupin, was sent to the bureau and fined. Now, citizens Xu Gu and others have sent a letter to the county party headquarters, advocating that this case be thoroughly investigated. The letter stated that on November 5th, local newspapers reported that district chiefs Wu Xinheng and others gambled with prostitutes. The Fourth Resident Station received a report and the witnesses were captured. The An Committee of your association also investigated the truth and published Officer Yao's statement in the Xinsheng newspaper. The people believe that this matter should be punished, but a month and a half has passed without any movement. Rumors in society say that the district chiefs used heavy bribes to influence the county government, the public security bureau, and your association to eliminate this matter without a trace. The county government and the public security bureau are not to be blamed. Your association represents the people and claims to be revolutionary. Why are you also silent? Is there really any condition or threat that makes your association dare not make a statement? At this time of widespread natural disasters and impending foreign aggression, the district chiefs do not know how to lead the people and work hard, but still enjoy themselves in pleasure. They violate the law and betray their conscience. If they are not severely punished, what about the future of district administration? Therefore, we specially submit to your association, hoping that you will clearly announce the truth and dispel public doubts. It is now learned that the county party headquarters has requested instructions from the provincial party headquarters for handling after receiving the report.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>The County Party Headquarters Mediates the Dispute of the Student Federation: The Wuyi Student Anti-Japanese National Salvation Federation has recently had a dispute over the continuation of the strike and the resumption of classes. Various schools such as Zhengheng Middle School, which do not agree with the continuation of the strike, announced their withdrawal from the Student Federation and resumed classes on the 28th. The executive committee members of the Student Federation, Zou Dazhang and others, have simultaneously resigned due to the difficulty of handling affairs, and plan to convene a representative meeting on the 28th to discuss everything. However, due to the lack of a quorum, the meeting could not be held, so the temporary executive committee was changed to a meeting, and it was decided to submit the resignation and other issues to the county party headquarters for handling. The county party headquarters believes that the student national salvation movement cannot be allowed to disperse and stagnate, and specially convened a representative conference of various schools on the 29th to discuss various difficult problems in order to facilitate the progress of the association.</p>
<p>The New Finance Bureau Chief Takes Office: Qian Zhaoda, the chief of the Wuyi Finance Bureau, has been ordered to wait for another appointment. The vacancy will be filled by Xu Jihua, the chief of the Taixian Finance Bureau. Chief Xu arrived in Chang on the afternoon of the 27th and took office in the bureau on the 28th.</p>

<p>Various Industries Hold a Meeting to Maintain the Financial Market: Nantong's money houses have been affected by the disaster and the current situation, and the repayment of loans has been difficult. The silver and money industries in Shanghai and other ports have come to squeeze the money houses, and depositors have withdrawn money, causing a great panic in the financial market. Various industries are unable to maintain their operations because the money houses only collect money and do not lend it out, causing a breakdown in turnover. Representatives of various industries specifically scheduled an emergency meeting on the 29th at the Chamber of Commerce to maintain the financial market. The money houses have asked the banks for assistance and have agreed on a joint guarantee method for the money houses. On the one hand, withdrawals by depositors are temporarily restricted in order to facilitate turnover.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Qingyang Middle School's Expulsion of the Principal: Yu Cheng, the principal of Qingyang Private Middle School, has been in office for four and a half years. Recently, there was a sudden trend to expel the principal. The student self-government supervisory committee decided on the 27th to send a letter to Principal Yu, asking him to leave the school immediately.

<h3>Yangzhou</h3>

<p>The Reason for the Education Funding Panic: The education surtax, land donation, and string donation for the 20th year, which were used to compensate for the compilation of local chronicles and allocated for expenses, were presented to the financial bureau by the people who manage education for transfer and receipt. Since the opening of the levy during the busy season before and after the winter grain transport, the financial bureau has not allocated a penny for education expenses, and the director of the financial bureau, Tong Maogu, has been transferred to Jiangyin, and there is no time to be responsible. Yesterday, Director Jia specially invited the general clerks of each counter and the chief of the revenue collection section of the financial bureau to attend a discussion on this issue. However, the general clerks blamed it on the fact that the education expenses for the 20th year had been handed over to the financial bureau, totaling 20,000 yuan, of which one-fourth was for education expenses. As a result, the financial bureau has agreed to move money under the fund item, but is not willing to use it. Now, they are extremely anxious. In addition to preparing a document to request instructions, they are also convening a meeting of principals to discuss maintenance methods.</p>
<p>Provincial Order to Protect Party Affairs Workers: The Jiangsu Provincial Government specifically telegraphed this county government yesterday regarding the proper protection of Kuomintang party members and party affairs workers in the county. After receiving the telegram, the county government immediately telegraphed the Public Security Bureau to provide proper protection.</p>

Upon receiving the news, the Suzhou Governor's Office sent Aide-de-Camp Li Yishun with a pistol team of twenty men to Nanjing yesterday to serve as Feng's guards.</p>

<p>Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway to Increase Services: The Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway is an important artery in Zhejiang Province. In the past, it was simplified due to funding reasons. Later, with the success of the syndicate loan, nine locomotives and thirty passenger cars were purchased from abroad. The bureau has recently seen an increase in the number of passengers, and the daily vehicle capacity is insufficient. It can only operate one up and down service per day, and passengers are crowded.

<h3>Municipal Qimei Elementary School Holds Inauguration Ceremony</h3>
<p>Municipal Qimei Elementary School on Dixiwei Road and Tiantong Road was founded in August of this year and has been in operation for five months. The school authorities originally planned to hold the inauguration ceremony on the birthday of Mr. Chen Qimei. After inquiring Chen Guofu via letter, they learned that it was the fifteenth day of the twelfth lunar month, which, according to the Gregorian calendar, would fall during the winter vacation, making it inconvenient to hold the ceremony. Therefore, it was advanced to New Year's Day next year.

It is reported that invitations have been sent to invite various schools to visit and provide guidance.</p>

<p>丨Selection Committee Statement</p>
<p>▲The Selection Committee stated that there are many players in the British army who should have been selected but were not selected. The reason is that when the interport game is held, there will be troop movements, and it is feared that it will be difficult to participate. There are also many well-known Chinese and foreign players. The selection committee deliberately did not select them because their skills are already well-known. It seems that they do not need to participate in the first trial match. Other news will be announced tomorrow.</p>

Milling controlled everything, with no one else in sight. Bi Xue was the top scorer with 22 points. Xu Kepei of the Hong team was the most accurate shooter, scoring 13 points in total.

<h3>After the Japanese Invasion and Occupation of Liaoning and Jilin</h3>
<p>Developing Northeast Ports</p>
<p>▲ The First Step in Developing Manchu-Mongolian Economy</p>
<p>▲ Huludao Actually Recognized as a Japanese Trade Port</p>
<p>▲ Unified with the Three Ports of Chongjin and Dalian</p>
<p>After the Japanese invasion and occupation of our Liaoning and Jilin provinces, they attacked our Jinzhou again, aiming to complete their so-called "Manchu-Mongolian continental policy" and develop their economic aggression. Since the three provinces came under their control, they urgently want to implement a new strategy for seaport trade. The following is a detailed record of the information obtained by our reporter.</p>
<p>▲ Unifying Three Ports　　Japanese transportation in the Northeast has been relying on Dalian Port as the sole outlet to the sea. In recent years, since our Dong Province added various railways and opened Huludao, Mantetsu (South Manchuria Railway) and Dalian's land and water transportation have suffered a major blow. Therefore, without taking time to consider, they used force to seize our Northeast and then proceeded to unify maritime transport. Hence, they urgently attacked Jinzhou to seize Huludao as a springboard, intending to combine the development of Dalian, Chongjin, and Huludao. They will abolish tariffs that hinder the export of their goods, unifying the sovereignty of the three trading ports: Dalian on the coast of the Dalian Bay, Chongjin at the Korean Sea entrance, and Huludao in the Bohai Bay, developing them simultaneously. This way, the exports of North Korea and North Manchuria can be exported as much as possible. In a few years, it can achieve the top position in Japanese seaport trade.</p>
<p>▲ Discussing Increasing Ships　　Japan already has eighty-seven merchant ships in the Lushun (Port Arthur) and Dalian area, accounting for 343,582 registered tons, plus forty-eight small ships under 1,000 tons and one hundred and thirty-eight sailboats. Recently, the Japanese authorities have consulted with various steamship companies in the country to discuss the prosperity of trade and shipping in the three seaports of Dalian, Chongjin, and Huludao. It is planned to add ships directly to these three seaports from various ports in Japan's mainland, such as Tsuruga and Fushiki. The Shimatani Steamship Company has already built two new ships, each of 3,500 tons, preparing to operate on this new route in February of next year. The Osaka Steamship Company also plans to deploy several ships from its ten newly built ships, scheduled to be completed next spring, to travel to the three seaports.</p>
<p>▲ Transplanting Japanese People　　Since our country boycotted Japanese goods, the number of unemployed workers in Japan has increased daily. It is now heard that the Japanese authorities have decided to allocate funds from the government to assist in the transplantation of unemployed Japanese laborers to the provinces of Liaoning and Jilin to engage in development and other projects. The first batch has already been dispatched by a certain Japanese transportation company in this port to transport unemployed workers from the Kawaguchi Factory in that country, totaling 4,700 people, who have begun to be transferred to Liaoning. The second and third transfers of Japanese people are being planned.</p>
<h3>Arsenal Yesterday</h3>
<p>Early Distribution of Year-End Bonuses</p>
<p>▲ Misunderstanding and Disturbance Occurred the Day Before Yesterday</p>
<p>▲ The Distribution of Money Yesterday Appeased the Unrest</p>
<p>A disturbance occurred at the Shanghai Arsenal the afternoon before yesterday, with workers suddenly destroying the office and assaulting Peng Zhenzhi, the chief of the general affairs section, and surrounding the factory director, Song Shi. The details of the situation are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Reasons for the Outbreak　　This incident was caused by workers requesting the distribution of year-end bonuses. The year-end bonus for the factory was 100,000 yuan. When Director Guo Chengen handed over the factory, he had telegraphed and obtained permission from the Ministry of Military Administration to deduct 20,000 yuan for advances, leaving 80,000 yuan. This year, the Ministry of Military Administration's funds were extremely short, and it had been discussed to suspend the distribution of year-end bonuses for this year. However, factory director Song Shi believed that the year-end bonus had been a long-standing tradition, and if it were suddenly suspended, it would greatly affect the year-end expenses budget of the workers. In addition to personally requesting it from Vice Minister Chen Yi when he came to Shanghai, he also went to Beijing on the 25th to strongly argue for it with the Ordnance Bureau, which granted permission. Therefore, Song returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday.</p>
<p>▲ Destruction　　Before Song returned to Shanghai, he sent a telegram notifying the head of the accounting department of the factory to inform the workers to work with peace of mind, that the bonus had been approved. However, the accounting department, although notified by Song's telegram, did not know if the money was available and feared that if the notice was posted, the workers would demand payment, and there would be no money to pay. Therefore, they did not dare to announce the telegram. As the end of the year was approaching, the workers had not received their bonuses and feared that they would not be paid. Therefore, after Director Song arrived at the factory at 3 PM, they surrounded him. Initially, Song stood on the terrazzo floor of the general office, announcing to the workers that wages would be paid on the 30th and bonuses on the 31st. When the workers did not agree, he changed it to bonuses on the 30th and wages on the 31st. The workers requested Song to distribute the money on the 29th, as work would be stopped on the 31st. Song believed that the procedures for the 29th would not be completed in time and retreated to the mailroom of the documentation department. The workers were furious and began to destroy the director's office, the secretary's office, and the general affairs section in the office building. They used ladders to climb the stairs and destroy the upper floors. Later, because the upper floor was where former Director Guo handled the handover, they retreated.</p>
<p>▲ Section Chief Beaten　　When the workers were carrying out the destruction, Director Song and all the staff had already hidden. Therefore, only the sound of breaking glass was heard. At that time, Peng Zhenzhi, the head of the general affairs section of the factory, happened to pass by the office building and was mistakenly identified as Director Song by the workers, who attacked him in a group and knocked him to the ground. Later, after other workers proved the misunderstanding, they released him, but Peng had already been injured.</p>
<p>▲ Mediation Process　　Around 8 PM, the workers had not yet dispersed. Zhang Deqing, the head of the factory's engineering department, and other staff members came forward to mediate, agreeing to pay the bonuses on the 29th and the wages on the 30th. At this point, the workers were satisfied, and they gradually dispersed after 10 PM.</p>
<p>▲ Bonus Paid Yesterday　　Yesterday afternoon at 1 PM, the factory made every effort to distribute the bonuses according to the names on the list, and the process was completed at 4 PM, ending the disturbance.</p>
<h3>British-Owned Public Buses</h3>
<p>Fully Resumed Operation Yesterday</p>
<p>▲ The Company Agrees to Find a Way to Bail Out the Workers</p>
<p>After all the ticket sellers of the British-owned public bus company resumed work, after self-negotiations, they unconditionally resumed work yesterday morning. All routes have been fully restored. The details of each situation are listed as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Full Resumption of Work　　The ticket sellers on strike sent representatives the day before yesterday to negotiate with the company. The manager agreed to unconditionally resume work and find a way to bail out ticket seller number one. After a meeting at Xiaoshadu that night, they gathered at the company's gate on Connaught Road at 5:15 yesterday morning and entered the company to resume work.</p>
<p>▲ Complete Service　　From 5:30 AM yesterday morning, British-owned public buses, Route 1 Jing'an Temple to Bazihchang, Route 2 Eryangjing Bridge to Bazihchang, Route 4 Xujiahui to Airport, Route 5 Sanmaoge Bridge to North Railway Station, Route 6 Bazihchang to Lan Road, Route 7 Caojiadu to Jiaotong University, Route 9 Jing'an Temple to Electric Light Factory, Route 10 Caojiadu to Yixiang Township, AC special express bus, completely resumed service.</p>
<p>▲ Withdrawal of Police　　In order to maintain traffic, the company had negotiated with the police station to have armed police officers accompany the buses to protect their operation. Now that the workers have resumed work, they have been withdrawn from yesterday. As for the armed police officers of the Municipal Public Security Bureau and the Chinese and Western detectives of the Gordon Road Police Station stationed near the company, they have also been completely withdrawn from yesterday.</p>
<p>▲ Strike Losses　　After the ticket sellers went on strike, the company completely suspended all routes of public buses, resulting in a loss of approximately 4,000 yuan per day in ticket sales and other losses. Calculated over three days, the loss is approximately over 10,000 yuan. All ticket sellers sacrificed their wages due to the strike, with an average of 23 yuan per month, approximately 200 yuan per day, totaling over 600 yuan for three days.</p>
<p>▲ Expressing Submission　　The ticket sellers told the reporter of the New Sound News Agency yesterday that the purpose of the strike was to resolve the issue of ticket seller number one and alleviate their personal suffering. However, due to lack of preparation beforehand and lack of organization afterward, there were differences of opinion. In addition, the company's attitude was strong, and it announced the dismissal of all striking workers, leaving them with no recourse. They had no choice but to submit to the oppression and unconditionally resume work, sacrificing three days of wages during the strike.</p>
<h3>Rihua Factory Workers Petitioned Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ Demanding Serious Negotiations</p>
<p>▲ Leading Female Workers</p>
<p>After being rejected to resume work at the cloth machine section of the Rihua yarn factory in Pudong, all the workers originally planned to petition to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau at 10 AM yesterday, but due to rain, they sent representatives with a petition. The petition is recorded below:</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>We are submitting a petition for the factory to stop suppressing the striking workers and requesting lawful relief. We, the female workers, are driven by life to work in the Rihua yarn factory. We are constantly subjected to all kinds of oppression by the Japanese imperialist capitalists, causing us immense suffering. Since the recent Northeast Incident occurred, the factory has intensified its oppression of the workers, dismissing hundreds of workers from various sections. The workers, considering international relations, feared being provoked, so they repeatedly endured the pain. Unexpectedly, on the 24th of this month, the factory ordered their lackeys, Hu Azhen and Zhang Fuying, to continue the oppression. (Omission) The day before yesterday afternoon, officials from your bureau came to the factory to mediate, and we workers complied and resumed work. Unexpectedly, the evil capitalists used violence to drive all the female workers out of the factory. Yesterday morning, the factory issued another announcement, continuing to dismiss more than thirty female workers. We heard that a large number of dismissals are still pending. The female workers are being brutally trampled on, with no avenue to complain. After discussion and resolution, 1. We request the superiors to severely punish the capitalists' brutal acts. 2. We request the superiors to severely punish the instigators, the female worker lackeys Zhang Fuying and Hu Azhen, and permanently prohibit them from working in the factory. 3. The factory should compensate the workers for losses and pay six months' severance pay for forcing them to leave the factory. All of the above cases have been approved by the entire group. We believe that your bureau is the leading organization for workers, handling labor-capital disputes with impartiality. Therefore, we plead with your bureau to consider the hardship of the workers and immediately negotiate seriously with the factory, and transfer the case to the Public Security Bureau to arrest Zhang Fuying and Hu Azhen for legal action, in order to maintain our livelihoods and calm public anger.</p>

<p>After the tragic incident at the Daxin Dye Factory on Binlang Road, Xiaoshadu, West Shanghai, yesterday, the Municipal Party Headquarters and others discussed the aftermath and formulated five measures. All workers in the city also held a joint meeting to discuss assistance measures. The details of each item are listed as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Emergency Meeting　　The Dyeing Industry Weaving Workers' Union Silk Finishing Office held an emergency meeting of workers from various factories at the Labor Union on Luban Road at 6 PM yesterday, presided over by Liu Jintai. After reporting on the progress, the meeting was held to discuss and resolve: 1. The factory should be responsible for the medical expenses of the injured, the compensation for the dead, and all losses. 2. Punish the murderers. 3. Please the Chairman of the Trade Association, Zhu Wenqi, to be responsible for mediation. As for the injured workers, they are still not out of danger at the Nanyang Hospital.</p>
<p>▲ Consultation on Measures　　At 10 AM yesterday, Liu Jinshu and Zhou Jintai, standing committee members of the Silk Finishing Office, and Zhu Wenqi, chairman of the Silk Finishing Trade Association, went to the Municipal Party Headquarters to discuss the aftermath of the Daxin Factory case and the issue of closure and dissolution. Jiang Huaisu, secretary-general of the Municipal Party Headquarters, Xu Yefu, director of the Civil Training Section, and representatives of various labor unions, Li Yongxiang and Zhou Xuexiang, jointly discussed the measures, and it was decided: (A) Regarding the closure issue, 1. Each person should be paid 100 yuan in severance pay. 2. Please the Trade Association to supervise, and in the future, if any factory has a closure situation, it must first submit it to the Party and government organs for approval. 3. If the old shareholders take over the old Daxin Factory in the future, they must give priority to hiring the old workers. If new shareholders take over, please the old shareholders do everything possible to introduce the old workers. (B) Regarding the tragic case, 1. The Trade Association should publish an apology to the workers for the police beating the workers. 2. In addition to the capital bearing the medical expenses, the beaten workers should also be subsidized for recuperation expenses, 100 yuan for minor injuries and 500 yuan for serious injuries, and compensation will be given in the event of death.</p>
<p>▲ Worker Assistance　　More than seventy labor unions, including the postal, water and electricity, cigarette, cotton flannel, and cotton spinning industries, held a joint meeting at 7 PM yesterday to discuss assistance to the Daxin Factory's oppression of workers case. It was heard that it was resolved to: 1. Submit a petition to the Municipal Party Headquarters to severely punish the murderers. 2. All workers in the city are willing to support the Daxin Factory's tragic case.</p>
<p>▲ Factory Statement　　The Daxin Factory told the reporter of the New Sound News Agency yesterday that the closure of the factory had been mediated by the Social Affairs Bureau and approved by the Municipal Government's Directive No. 1575, which stated that the factory was willing to subsidize the workers due to losses, and the workers' unreasonable demands should be rebuked and ignored, and there was no need for arbitration. The factory immediately announced and advised the workers to receive the money and leave the factory. Unexpectedly, the workers ignored it. Later, the board of directors resolved to send shareholder representatives to the factory on the 28th to pay the workers in accordance with the Factory Law's dismissal fees and an extra one and a half months' subsidy, and notified the Gordon Road Police Station to send police to the factory to supervise the workers' receipt of money and departure from the factory. At that time, a few workers blocked the factory's vehicle from delivering goods, preventing it from passing, which led to a minor conflict with the police.</p>

<h3>The Seamen's Reorganization Association Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ Telegraphed a Letter to Seamen All Over the World</p>
<p>▲ Regarding the Japanese Attack on Jinzhou</p>
<p>The Reorganization Committee of the Chinese Seamen's Union telegraphed a letter to workers all over the world yesterday regarding the Japanese invasion and occupation of the Northeast and the attack on Jinzhou. The translation is as follows: Japanese imperialism, taking advantage of the natural and man-made disasters in our country, and taking unreasonable actions with its powerful force, has completely torn up the Pact of Paris and the Nine-Power Treaty, which guarantee international peace. Looking at Japan's lack of sincerity in accepting the resolutions of the League of Nations, its cunning and untrustworthiness have been exposed to the world. Since the end of the Council of the League of Nations, Japan has recently attacked our Jinzhou again, and the situation has become increasingly serious. Japan's occupation of the Northeast is not only to complete its continental policy of aggression, but also to destroy the interests of the Far East international economy. The result is to destroy the livelihood of farmers and workers in various countries and to plunder the vast treasures of our Northeast. It especially makes the toiling farmers and workers in our three eastern provinces permanently trapped in a tragic situation, indirectly affecting the improvement of the lives of the working class worldwide. Now it has completely exposed its hideous face to suck the blood and sweat of our toiling farmers and workers. This association solemnly writes to workers all over the world that Japan's recent atrocities have become increasingly intolerable. All our nationals can no longer endure this. In the future, we will continue our economic severance with Japan and spare no major sacrifices to take legitimate resistance and seek national integrity. This association respectfully requests all workers in the world to morally sanction the Japanese imperialism, which disregards justice and credibility and exploits the blood and sweat of our toiling farmers and workers, and give our nationals practical sympathy and assistance. Cut off all relations with Japanese commerce and implement an economic boycott to jointly promote Japan's awareness in order to maintain world justice and peace.</p>
<h3>General Chamber of Commerce Alliance's External Declaration</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Alliance issued an external declaration yesterday, saying that the Japanese military actions of invading and occupying our three northeastern provinces since September 18 are no different from Germany's invasion of Belgium by force on August 14, 1914, and its destruction of peace and harm to the world is even worse. Japan and our country are of the same writing and race, yet it disregards justice and humanity, and violates alliance treaties and agreements to trample on us. When it completes its continental policy, the Far East market will inevitably be monopolized. Today, it ignores the words of various countries. At that time, it will have fuller wings, and it will not take the friends of various countries into account. The pain of biting one's navel is not unique to our country. We sincerely hope that friends from friendly countries will see the overall situation clearly and make plans for early fire prevention. Otherwise, the serious consequences of being burned will be even greater than the European War. Special declaration, Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Alliance.</p>

<p>▲ Declaration　　Shanghai Youth Volunteer Suicide Squad to Resist Japan and Save the Country Declaration:</p>
<p>Since the September 18th National Crisis occurred, Japanese bandits have taken advantage of our disasters to occupy our territory and massacre our compatriots, using their tactics to destroy Korea and implement their Manchu-Mongolian policy. Our compatriots cry out helplessly, waiting to die. Our government respects peace and supports the League of Nations. But the so-called League of Nations is only a transitional mechanism for human civilization in the 20th century, without any real power to judge right and wrong. Therefore, for several months, the League of Nations has been the League of Nations, and the Japanese bandits have been the Japanese bandits, still carrying out their robbery tactics, invading and plundering everything possible. They have occupied Liaoning and Heilongjiang and coveted Tianjin. Countless compatriots have died miserably. The country has not yet perished, but the knife is already being applied. Ridiculing friendly countries, how far will this go? Although General Ma is fighting in the front and Commander Zhang is volunteering in the back, the building is about to collapse, and a single tree cannot support it. We are deeply saddened as citizens, and we feel the responsibility of every citizen for the rise and fall of the country. Therefore, we have gathered Shanghai comrades to organize the Youth Volunteer Suicide Squad to Resist Japan and Save the Country, to follow in the footsteps of the patriotic martyrs, using our blood and heads to resist Japan and save the country. If the Japanese bandits do not retreat, we vow not to return alive. This is purely a patriotic proposition, with no partisan role. All Chinese territory and ethnic defense, regardless of where the disaster occurs or who is attacked, we are determined not to divide boundaries, willing to be pioneers, be war ghosts, and not be slaves of a fallen country. The rise and fall of the country depend on this action. All my youth, rise up and come!</p>

<h3>A Dancer's Heartless Act</h3>
<p>Singing a Parting Song</p>
<p>▲After a Reluctant Kiss</p>
<p>▲How Could a Former Lover Endure This?</p>
<p>▲Singing Heartbreakingly</p>
<p>▲Driven to Fury, Committing Murder and Losing Her Life</p>
<p>Valentine Beatsvitch (age 22), a Russian dancer residing at No. 20 Huishan Road, was stabbed in the throat with a knife by her lover, Ivan Kormilstoff (age 28), also Russian and a musician, at around 8 PM the day before yesterday. She died instantly. The Western Detective Baker and Russian Detective Derlan of the Huishan Police Station arrived at the scene after receiving the report and arrested Ivan, along with the murder weapon, and took them to the police station for detention. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper.</p>
<p>▲Coming to Shanghai Together from Harbin　　Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Special Court by Gao Yiting. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that the defendant and the victim met and lived together in Harbin. In September of this year, they came to Shanghai together and resided at No. 62 Molilai Road in the French Concession. Valentine became a dancer at the French businessman Labbett Dance Hall, while the defendant found a job as a musician at the International Recreation Club.</p>
<p>▲The Woman Falls in Love with Someone Else　　Later, Valentine had another lover, which caused frequent quarrels between them, and they separated. The defendant then moved to No. 347 Broadway Road, while Valentine lived alone at No. 20 Huishan Road. Although their relationship had cooled, the defendant still visited Valentine occasionally, but was often met with coldness or denied entry.</p>
<p>▲Several Visits Refused　　On the 26th of this month, the defendant had a dispute with his landlord and was evicted. He went to Valentine's place and begged to live with her, but Valentine refused, saying she had another guest. The defendant returned dejectedly and stayed temporarily at a friend's place at No. 60 Gongping Road. At around 7 PM on the 27th, the defendant went to her place again, but left when he saw a guest there. At 5 PM the next afternoon, he went again, but the door was locked and no one answered his knocks.</p>
<p>▲Singing a Song of Marital Separation　　Around 7 PM, the woman opened the door and let him in. He went upstairs and saw a Westerner sitting there, who soon left. The defendant then chatted with the woman. The woman mocked him, pointing to her beautiful dress, saying it was bought for her by a guest for seventy yuan. She also said that in the past, when the defendant bought her new clothes, she had repeatedly refused them. After a while, the woman sang a heartbreaking song of marital separation. The defendant was unhappy to hear it and asked her to stop singing, but she ignored him.</p>
<p>▲Losing Her Life Instantly　　Suddenly, the defendant became very angry and took out a fruit knife from his coat pocket and stabbed the woman in the neck. She fell to the ground, bleeding profusely, and cried for help. The maid, Zhang Li, entered and was shocked to see the scene. At that time, the defendant held the woman's hand, looking remorseful, and said to the maid in Russian that she should report to the police station, saying that Valentine had been killed by him.</p>
<p>▲The Murderer Admits to the Killing　　The maid told a Russian woman living with her, Mary Shanax, who telegraphed the police detectives. They rushed to the scene and saw the defendant sitting blankly beside the woman. They arrested him and found the murder weapon on the floor. The defendant admitted at the police station that he had killed Valentine. He presented the confession and the murder weapon for inspection. Then, the Western Detective reported the circumstances of the arrest. The witnesses, the Russian woman Mary and the maid Zhang Li, also described the previous events.</p>
<p>▲A Reluctant Kiss　　When questioned, the defendant confessed that he met the deceased Valentine in Harbin and came to Shanghai to live together. He also recounted the details of the incident, saying that the knife was bought on the 25th of this month at a shop on Huade Road for cutting fruit. He was drunk at the time, so he put it in his pocket and forgot to take it out. He said that he did not intend to kill her, but that she was singing a song of marital separation, which made him unhappy. He then gave her a kiss, which she reluctantly accepted. When he wanted to kiss her again, she shouted loudly, which made him angry and led to the tragedy. He also said that in the past, when he met her on the street, she often invited him to chat, but then repeatedly refused to open the door for him. He was only allowed inside at the time, otherwise, the incident would not have happened. Judge Shen Bingrong reviewed the confession and asked the police lawyer Zhang to debate the case. He then ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody, awaiting sentencing on the 30th (this morning).</p>
<h3>After the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Committee Issued a Statement</h3>
<p>▲Wu Tiecheng Has Already Replied</p>
<p>The entire Executive and Supervisory Committee of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce issued a joint statement regarding the case of Feng Shaoshan and Zhao Nangong of the Shanghai Special City Merchant Movement Committee taking over the business on the 18th of this month. The original statement was printed and sent to Chen Mingshu, Shao Lizi, and Wu Tiecheng, the three committee members appointed by the Central Government to guide party affairs in Shanghai, for their perusal. The Chamber of Commerce received a reply from Committee Member Wu Tiecheng yesterday, stating: "To the Chamber of Commerce Executive and Supervisory Committee: Your statement has been forwarded to the Presidium of the First Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Committee for their review. When the Standing Committee of the Central Committee is elected, it will be handed over for processing. Please note."</p>
<h3>Zhao Nangong's Remarks</h3>
<p>▲Most Concerned About Wang Xiao's Statement</p>
<p>Datong News Agency reported that Zhao Nangong, executive member of the Merchant Movement Committee, issued a statement on behalf of the committee yesterday. He said that Wang Xiao赖君's statement in the newspaper the day before yesterday regarding the anti-Japanese association's accounts was very slick, but the truth was all there. It could not be erased with a single stroke of the pen and had to be corrected. Wang's statement was not defending the past anti-Japanese association, but rather saying that the current Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association could not be held responsible for the past. This shows that justice has not been abandoned, and the incompetence of the previous anti-Japanese association is evident in the words. Who is controlling the current Chamber of Commerce? Who was controlling the previous anti-Japanese association? And who is controlling the current Anti-Japanese Association? It is always the same group, without any difference. The General Chamber of Commerce could not bear the trampling of merchants and had to advocate for justice against the anti-Japanese association. As a result, they offended the taboo and were ordered to dissolve. Wang was also a member of the committee at the time. Perhaps he has forgotten about it due to his recent political activities. However, the general merchants have not forgotten the deep pain of the past. Wang is a pure merchant, but once his position changes, he forgets the position of the people. He still calls for national salvation and merchant protection. This is what Shanghai merchants hope for and pray for, but the situation is far from what Wang says, which makes merchants fear the imminent destruction of the country. This is written with emotion to question the current situation. (Signed: Zhao Nangong)</p>

<h3>Navigation Administration Bureau Inspects Dada Shipping Vessels</h3>
<p>▲Chief Officer and Second Officer of the Dade Case Must Report Within Three Days</p>
<p>▲Inspection of the Dayu is Complete, Continuing to Inspect Other Vessels</p>
<p>The Navigation Administration Bureau has been ordered by the Ministry of Communications to thoroughly investigate the truth of the Dade fire. The bureau specifically notified Dada Company to order the captain, chief officer, and second officer of the Dade to report to the bureau yesterday to inquire about the true situation. However, according to the company's request, they asked to postpone the report for three days. At the same time, the Navigation Administration Bureau must inspect all of Dada Company's vessels to check their content and equipment to avoid future accidents. As of yesterday, the largest Dayu vessel of the company has been inspected, and the remaining vessels must also be inspected before they are allowed to sail. As for the follow-up measures after the thorough investigation, they must be reported to the Ministry of Communications for review before a decision can be made.</p>
<h3>Shops and Residents</h3>
<p>Obstructions Prohibited on Roadsides</p>
<p>▲Implemented Starting from New Year's Day</p>
<p>Shops and residents along the roadsides in the Public Concession often place wooden boards and cabinets in front of their doors or outside the walls, or install awnings and window awnings too low, obstructing pedestrians. The public feels very inconvenient. The Police Department and Works Department of the Municipal Council have long advised the shops not to obstruct traffic. Recently, they have formulated two new chapters based on the appendix, namely (1) awnings or their parts must not be installed below seven feet six inches from the sidewalk or below fifteen feet from the road surface, and (2) fixtures, stalls, platforms, or other movable objects must not be placed in front of any building, extending into the sidewalk or road. These new chapters will be implemented starting from New Year's Day, January 1st. All shopkeepers should move these items immediately to avoid being dealt with by the police.</p>
<h3>Gao Hang District</h3>
<p>Farmers' Association Opposes Ferry Price Increase</p>
<p>The Gao Hang District Farmers' Association issued a declaration opposing the increase in ferry prices by the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities, stating (the above is omitted). After reading the report on the 18th of this month that the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities plans to increase the price of the ferry between Gaoqiao and Shanghai starting from January 1st, we find that the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities established the ferry to facilitate the citizens and not for profit. This year, disasters have been frequent, agricultural production has been poor, and the rural economy is on the verge of bankruptcy. The livelihood of the people is extremely difficult. The rulers should reduce the ticket prices to ease the burden on the people. However, the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities does not plan to do this and insists on raising prices in the autumn of the people's livelihood, regardless of the people's suffering. The annual surplus of more than 89,000 yuan is not enough, and they intend to extract more. Where does the huge surplus come from? It is nothing more than the blood and sweat of the farmers. For the sake of reducing the burden on the farmers, the association firmly opposes the increase. We hope that all parties will unanimously support this and are grateful for this!</p>
<h3>Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities Urges</h3>
<p>Plumbers, Electricians, and Apprentices to Verify Licenses</p>
<p>▲Must Be Completed Within January</p>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities registers plumbers, electricians, and apprentices in the city and issues each person a license to work. The license is required to be sent to the bureau for verification in January of each year, along with a fee of one yuan for plumbers and five jiao for apprentices. The deadline is approaching. The bureau has issued a notice to all plumbers and apprentices to comply and bring their licenses to verify them by the deadline, or they will be punished according to the rules. It is said that the bureau will not be taking a holiday for the new year, so the bureau will be handling this matter starting from January 1st.</p>
<h3>Save Money on New Year's Cards and Donate to Relief Efforts</h3>
<p>▲Ye Yizhou Donates Funds and Promotes This</p>
<p>Ye Yizhou, a native of Anhui, due to the national disaster and flood this year, has eliminated the old practice of sending New Year's cards and donated five yuan to the Relief Association, setting an example for society. He also sent a letter to the resident committee member, with very painful words. The original text is recorded as follows: "Every time I read the reports of the relief workers and the requests of the relief agencies, the documents and telegrams are in chaos, and the reports are urgent. Every day, thousands of elderly, weak, and disabled victims die of cold and hunger. There are starved corpses everywhere, filling the ditches. How tragic is the situation! The winter relief task is to set up soup kitchens and distribute cotton clothes to help the elderly, weak, and disabled. Fortunately, the gentlemen of your association are working hard to manage and support the efforts, trying every means to raise funds for rescue. The elderly, weak, and disabled who are saved from death are all thanks to the charitable deeds of the gentlemen. Our country is a country of propriety and righteousness, respecting morality, caring for the elderly and the young, which is the foundation of the country. The saying goes, 'Treat the elderly of your family as you would treat the elderly of others, and treat the young of your family as you would treat the young of others, and the world can be operated in the palm of your hand.' The Great Harmony of the Book of Rites, the scene of peace, must make sure that the widowed, orphaned, lonely, and disabled are all supported. Our country exists in the world, avoiding extinction. The Liao, Jin, Yuan, and Qing dynasties were eventually assimilated by us. All of this is because of the bright and splendid national essence of more than 4,000 years, which has been tempered and molded. Today, the principle of winter relief is to help the elderly and children, and to support the disabled and sick. How shallow is this connection to the national essence? Moreover, we are facing a national crisis, and destruction is imminent. There is no time to mourn, let alone celebrate. It is not too late to celebrate after the lost territory is recovered. Shanghai is a major commercial port, and the population is no less than Tokyo, Japan. If one yuan of New Year's money is used to help winter relief, it will not be difficult to raise millions of yuan within three</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>or five days of the Gregorian New Year. Save the useless expenses and have a heart to save the world. If each person donates one yuan, one life can be saved. Accumulate sand into a tower and gather loyalty. This is what I hope for from the millions of compatriots in Shanghai."</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Road to Trial One-Way Traffic</h3>
<p>▲Between Suzhou Road and Beijing Road</p>
<p>▲Trial Effectiveness to Become Permanent Regulation</p>
<p>The Public Concession's Jiangxi Road, from Beijing Road to Suzhou Road, has been converted to one-way traffic and has been on trial for three months. The Police Department now proposes that it be made a permanent regulation. Based on police and traffic observations over the past three months, the effect of implementing one-way traffic has been very good. Although some people inevitably felt inconvenienced at the beginning of the reform, according to the police officers in charge of traffic, if the one-way traffic measure were now abolished, it would be necessary to completely prohibit parking on this section. If both were implemented, the general public would definitely feel even more inconvenienced. Moreover, those who need to load and unload goods at factories here for legitimate business needs would be greatly affected. The inconvenience of one-way traffic, however, only requires drivers to make a small turn or walk a few more steps after getting out of the car. Furthermore, there is ample parking space on the nearby Suzhou Road. All vehicles that cannot park on Jiangxi Road can park there. Considering the increasing traffic on the narrow roads within the concession, one-way traffic and no right turn regulations are indeed unavoidable measures. However, since traffic is made more convenient and danger is reduced as a result, the majority of the public benefits from them.</p>
<h3>Rent Dispute in Yixin Lane</h3>
<p>The Emergency Relief Association Asks Landlords to Donate Rent for Relief</p>
<p>The Shanghai Committee to Aid Tenants of Yixin Lane sent a letter yesterday to various flood emergency relief associations, stating that Yixin Lane landlord Cheng Linsheng owns real estate and can be persuaded to donate 5 million yuan, etc. Based on the letter, the association sent a letter to Cheng Linsheng yesterday, saying: "Mr. Linsheng, with your kind discernment, we respectfully inform you that we have received a letter from the Shanghai All-Circles Committee to Aid Tenants of Yixin Lane, (original letter omitted), etc. The association believes that disaster relief and rescue are matters of compassion shared by Chinese and foreigners alike. As the saying goes, 'The heart of compassion is possessed by all.' This year, the floods in various provinces have been catastrophic, with unprecedented devastation. Now that it is severe winter, tens of millions of disaster victims are suffering from hunger and cold, urgently awaiting relief. We rely entirely on benevolent people from all walks of life to generously donate according to their ability, to gather strength and provide assistance, to achieve the work of helping the injured and rescuing the dying. As for persuading major landlords to donate rent for relief, the association has repeatedly appealed in newspapers, time and again, which we believe you have long been aware of. Based on the principle of human mutual assistance, you should be actively involved. We have long admired your willingness to do what is right, never shirking responsibility, showing compassion beyond the ordinary, and giving even more generously. Your generosity is extraordinary, and your kindness will certainly be remembered by future generations. Faced with these wailing victims, you must have grand aspirations. Therefore, we send this special letter to inform you. With your understanding, we believe you will surely benefit the disaster victims, so as to silence the rumors that are not true. As the saying goes, 'Only a virtuous person can accept all kinds of advice.' We hope you will consider it. We respectfully wish you well and await your reply."</p>

<h3>Burglary at Aide-de-Camp's Home</h3>
<p>▲One Thief Caught on the Spot</p>
<p>Wang Ziliang, aide-de-camp of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, resided at No. 5 Yuzhen Lane, Laozhenfu Road, in the French Concession. At 4 PM the day before yesterday, six robbers suddenly arrived. They knocked on the door under the pretext of delivering a letter. Four of them entered, threatening with guns, and robbed clothes and cash, totaling 2,573 yuan, and fled with the loot. The victim's family immediately chased after them and blew a police whistle. Detective Inspector Jin Jiulin of the French Concession Police Department, along with Detective Li Yaolong, Deputy Detectives Zhang Ziying, Mao Jingen, Qian Yumin, and Constable Wang Wannian, were patrolling nearby and heard the sound, rushing to apprehend them. One thief was caught on the spot. He confessed his name was Ping Shengxiang, 26 years old, from Nanjing. He was taken into custody at the police station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Division of the Second Special Court. First, the police lawyer Gu Shouxi explained the case and stated that there were still accomplices at large and requested an extension for further interrogation. Then, the victim described the robbery, and the maid Liu Abao and the male servant Wang Ajin testified in court about the defendant's robbery. Ping Shengxiang confessed that yesterday afternoon, he stole a copper kettle from a certain family in Zhenhua Lane, opposite Yuzhen Lane, and fled. Coincidentally, the victim's family was chasing after a robbery and arrested him, accusing him of being a robber. He claimed he was only guilty of theft and dared not commit robbery, and pleaded for investigation. Judge Xiong ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody for further investigation.</p>

<h3>Record of the Trial of the Kidnapping Case in Huangdai Township</h3>
<p>▲Debate Concluded, Awaiting Sentencing</p>
<p>Xu Tianxun, Xu Agen, Chen Jinshui, and others, who were tea house waiters in Caishi Street South Inn and pimps in Xinhuanhua brothel, seeing the recent prosperity of the kidnapping business, where a single act could yield thousands of gold, were blinded by greed. They discovered that the only son of the Wang family in their native Huangdai Township, Suzhou, named Wang Tongsheng, was 12 years old. If they could get their hands on him, they could have a source of wealth. They took a car to Suzhou, then hired a motorized sampan to Huangdai, abducted Tongsheng to the boat, and then took a train to Shanghai. The child knew what was happening, and although he dared not speak out, he secretly sobbed, arousing the suspicion of inspectors. After questioning, the truth was revealed. The kidnappers could not escape on the train, so they were all arrested and sent to the Shanghai District Court. After investigation by Prosecutor Wang, they were prosecuted according to law. Yesterday, Judge Deng opened the court for trial. The defendants confessed to the kidnapping and stated that there were still accomplices, who were also professional tea house waiters and pimps. They claimed that they were poor and made bad friends, and were deceived by others. They also said that they had not yet discussed how much ransom they intended to demand. They pleaded for leniency. The judge, based on the defendants' confession, appointed lawyers to defend them. After the prosecutor's arguments, the debate was concluded and a date was set for sentencing. The defendants were remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory's Social Gathering Record</h3>

<h3>Additional Robbery Reports</h3>
<p>▲Minhang Road: At 10 AM yesterday, two thieves broke into No. 54 Minhang Road. One thief was armed with a pistol and robbed 68 silver dollars. As they were leaving, the victim called for help.

<p>▲Tangqiao Town: At the home of boatman Chen Xinxing, about three li south of Tangqiao Town, Pudong, near Niqiang, at around 6 PM the day before yesterday (the 28th), a loud knock was suddenly heard. Chen was out and his wife asked who it was. The person said he was sent by Wang Jifu (the head of the Tangqiao Security Team) to invite Mr. Chen to a drink. Chen's wife did not suspect anything and opened the door. Four robbers rushed in. Three were wearing blue cloth shirts and pants, one wearing a long cotton robe. They all spoke with a local accent. One of the thieves, about 20 years old, with a small face, was armed with a pistol. They first drove Chen's wife and the tenants Zhou Shun'gao and his wife to a corner, forbidding them from making any noise. The other thieves went straight into the east and west rooms and searched wantonly. They robbed 16 pieces of men's and women's unlined and lined clothing, one red silk quilt, one woolen hat, one red silk gauze quilt cover, 9 silver dollars, and 5,000 copper coins. The thieves fled towards the Huqiaomu Bridge with the loot. Afterwards, the victim rushed to report to the Third Precinct's Third Sub-station. Director Dong immediately dispatched Patrol Officer Xiao to lead the patrol officers to pursue and apprehend them, but the robbers had already gone far away.</p>
<h3>Christians' Disaster Relief and Christmas Celebration</h3>
<p>Christians throughout Shanghai, seeing that the disaster victims (shelters) in northern Shanghai number nearly 8,000, all of whom are travelers, are facing severe cold weather, lack of clothing and food, and the upcoming Christmas holiday, have united the Shanghai Women's Temperance Association, the Children's Welfare Association, the YMCA and YWCA, the Christian Benefit Society, and other organizations.

<h3>Repairing the Houses of the Imperial Grant Yangdian Cavalry Patrol Team</h3>
<p>Near the Imperial Grant Yangdian Temple in Pudong, there were several fair houses. In the past, two squads of the cavalry patrol team were stationed there to assist the police force of the Third Precinct and the First, Second, and Third Sub-stations, which were insufficient. When the National Revolutionary Army arrived in Shanghai in 1927, the team's horses and police officers were completely dispersed and have not been restored to this day. Zhang, the director of the Third Precinct of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, believes that the area has a connected relationship with the Third Precinct's Lanidu, Yangjiadu, Yangjing, and Tangqiao sub-stations and is strategically very important. Therefore, he has drafted a plan to move a small squad of the Fourth Detachment of the Police Brigade stationed at the Jingdu nunnery south of the Yangjing Temple to the original site of the cavalry patrol team in front of the Imperial Grant Yangdian Temple. However, the houses there are dilapidated and require major repairs. Therefore, he has submitted a request to the General Bureau to forward it to the Municipal Government for review and approval. Once approved, the repair work will be implemented immediately to strengthen the defense.</p>

Mr. Shen Enfu's "A Painful History of Diplomacy with Japan" continues in this issue, selecting important clauses from a study of all Sino-Japanese treaties and pointing out the mistakes.

<h3>Ban Jue Jushi Fortunes for People</h3>
<p>There is a person named Ban Jue Jushi, a southerner, who used to be the director of the Guangdong Provincial Police Department. He is proficient in esoteric Buddhism and can tell people's fortunes by observing their aura. He is also good at divination using the Book of Changes and plum blossom divination, and his predictions of good and bad luck, blessings and misfortunes are often surprisingly accurate. Now, because of the increasing number of inquirers, he has moved to the Huabin Hotel in Hongyu Lane, Huage Road, next to the Nanjing Cinema, to set up an altar to respond to the world. It is now the New Year, and there are even more people asking for fortunes. However, it is said that the Jushi in Shanghai will only form a relationship with a thousand people and will soon travel elsewhere. There is already a certain garrison commander and a certain Daoyin in this city who have set up shops to sell fortunes, and now another director has been added, which truly adds a lot of color to Junping.</p>

<h3>News from Trade Associations</h3>

<h3>Reader Communication</h3>
<p>Explanation of the Statistics of Reader Communications for Four Months</p>
<p>This newspaper established this column on September 1st. In a flash, four months have passed. Tomorrow will be the last day of the year 1931. Here is an explanation before publishing the statistics of this column for four months.</p>
<p>Before revealing the numbers, let me share some of my thoughts.</p>
<p>First, we are very grateful to the communicating gentlemen for expressing great trust in the people in this column. All the letters show great sincerity between the lines, even revealing the big picture of personal background, the privacy of male and female love, the hidden events of the family, and the reality of difficult livelihood. I am ashamed that I cannot provide satisfactory answers, but I have fully accepted the diligence of your intentions.</p>
<p>Second, all the answers given by the people in this column are limited by ability and cannot be completely satisfactory. However, there are indeed many that have a good impact. For example, in the case of the job change question, I was persuaded not to give up my old job lightly after some reply, and I later said that I was lucky not to fall into difficulties. In the case of divorce, I was persuaded to understand each other after replying, and I later said that I had reconciled and was even more friendly. Thank you for your letter. In addition, there was the initiation of the Ceramic Industry Improvement Company due to Mr. Liu Xintao's letter. All of these facts are what I can fortunately say to the readers is innocent.</p>
<p>Third, regarding the problem of schooling, anyone who asks about which school to go to is always answered that they should decide on their own based on their nature, talent, and environment, and never make a choice for them. It's not that I don't want to make a decision for them. The principle of future employment guidance and current schooling guidance should be like this. This kind of guidance procedure is best done in school, where teachers use a longer period of observation and various methods to find out the student's talent and nature, and inform the student of the results so that he can make his own decision. In communication, only the main points of the method can be briefly shown.</p>
<p>Fourth, the only thing that the people in this column think is absolutely impossible is to hope that the museum will introduce them to jobs. Since the museum does not have a job introduction department, there is no way to know where talent is needed to recommend them, so there is only a factual answer. Among them, the most requests for job changes are for the pawn industry, which shows that its treatment methods may have special unsuitable places. I sincerely hope that the authorities will quickly study and improve it to avoid additional problems.</p>
<p>Fifth, in the case of marriage, those who are engaged and want to discuss breaking the contract, although I don't want to easily approve it, I don't dare to advise them to force a reconciliation, for fear that they will be forced to reconcile first and end up in misfortune later. Anyone who comes to discuss divorce, unless it is absolutely necessary, will always persuade them to tolerate each other and forgive each other, because there is one point that should be noted, that is, after a divorce, it is not difficult for a man to remarry, but a woman is often bound by customs and age, and there is almost no possibility of remarrying. The suffering of her life is unspeakable. If we can do anything, we should try to preserve it.</p>
<p>Sixth, one point that I would like to especially state is that letters often do not follow the published regulations, or do not open a communication office, or do not affix communication stamps and postage stamps, resulting in no reply or no way to reply, accounting for as much as 40%. This category is mostly about current affairs issues, because they mistakenly think that current affairs issues are not restricted and have not read the regulations. I hope that you who communicate later will pay attention to it. Calculate with percentages, then</p>
<p>About schooling, career, and marriage issues, accounting for 53%.</p>
<p>About current affairs or other issues, accounting for 47%.</p>
<p>Divide the schooling, career, and marriage more closely, then</p>
<p>About schooling, accounting for 44%.</p>
<p>About careers, accounting for 38%.</p>
<p>About marriage, accounting for 18%.</p>
<p>According to gender, then</p>
<p>Men account for 93%.</p>
<p>Women account for 4.4%.</p>
<p>Groups or organizations account for 2.6%.</p>
<p>According to region, then</p>
<p>Shanghai accounts for 45%.</p>
<p>Other cities in the country account for 54%.</p>
<p>Other cities in foreign countries account for 1%.</p>
<p>To know the actual number, please read tomorrow's column.</p>

<p>Letter Received</p>
<p>To the respected Editor, upon reading today's local news section of your esteemed newspaper, which stated, "The executive committee of the pharmaceutical industry association held a meeting yesterday and formally established a reorganization committee, exercising all powers, and electing me as one of the reorganization committee members," I was extremely shocked and surprised. After investigation, I found that I did not participate in any such illegal meeting. I am afraid that members will misunderstand, so I am writing this letter specifically for clarification. I hope it can be published in the "Letters to the Editor" section. Sincerely, Zhao Zhenhui, Standing Director of the Shanghai Pharmaceutical Industry Workers' Union, December 29th.</p>
<p>Respected Editor, we have read the local news section of your esteemed newspaper on the 26th, which listed the names of Tao Renbao, Zhu Jinkui, Shen Yougen, and others as members of the organizing committee for the publishing industry union appointed by the Municipal Party Committee. However, we have nothing to do with the organizing committee, so we are writing specifically to clarify this matter. We request your newspaper to correct the record. Tao Renbao, Zhu Jinkui, Shen Yougen, respectfully.</p>
<h3>Announcement from Our Editorial Department</h3>

<h3>Reminiscences from Dai Liang</h3>
<p>— Yanzi</p>
<p>Between the White Mountains and Black Waters, heroes emerge in every era. In the late Qing Dynasty, figures like Liu Danzhi and 天 子 (the emperor?) all rose from the ranks of outlaws. They, along with Zhang Zuolin and Feng Lingge, dominated the Northeast, wielding power for a time. The only difference was that one was in the wilderness, and the other was in the government. In the early days of the Restoration, my fellow villager Mr. Pan Jianxing was doing business in Liaoning and Jilin and formed a close friendship with Liu Danzhi. They came to Shanghai together to purchase military equipment. A banquet was held at Yizhi Xiang, and I was invited to accompany him, along with Mr. Zhu Junzi. Initially, I thought Liu must be a heroic figure, appearing imposing. However, upon meeting him, I was greatly surprised. The so-called "Red-Bearded Leader" Liu Danzhi was actually a plainly dressed, honest, and simple rural farmer. After a brief greeting, he spoke haltingly and was not good at socializing. However, he had a tiger's waist and an ape's arms, his eyes revealed a fierce aura, and he had a sturdy physique. He was already over sixty years old, with white hair and beard. He did not say a word throughout the entire banquet. Pan Sheng said that Liu had over ten thousand subordinates who strictly observed military discipline. Anyone who committed adultery or rape would be executed without mercy. The soldiers feared him like a deity. He appeared and disappeared in the railway areas of North and South Manchuria. Both the Japanese and Russians feared his power. Major incidents occurred in the Yalu River area, and the Japanese army was often ravaged by him. Liu's special skill in life was being able to lie on the back of a horse and fire guns with both hands, and every shot was accurate. The military police surrounded Liu at Huanggu Tun. Liu led over ten horsemen in resistance, firing guns to annihilate the enemy. He leaped on his horse and broke through the encirclement, disappearing in an instant. In the end, there was nothing anyone could do. Liu's bravery and skill in battle are something the people of Liaoning can all talk about. What is recorded here is just a glimpse.</p>

<h3>A Tale of Two Mas, North and South</h3>
<p>— Qingqu</p>
<p>What are the two Mas? One is "Ma Zhanshan" of Hailun in the Northeast, and the other is "Ma Xiangbo" of Shanghai in the South. They share the same surname, Ma. In the Northeast, people call him "Good Ma," while in the South, people call him "Old Ma." The weight of expectations placed on the Mas at this time is indeed great. Let me describe the two Mas below. Since the violent Japanese invaded our Liaoning and Jilin, as an isolated army in a remote area, he has limited the advance of the Japanese troops, preventing them from being completely submerged under their iron hooves, and leaving a glimmer of military light. Everyone praises General Ma. So, what kind of person is General Ma? Mr. Ma's original hometown is HuaiDe, Liaoning. He started as a soldier. When Wu Jinsheng was in command of Longjiang, he was initially a platoon leader in the 29th Division, then promoted to company commander, and soon after to battalion commander. From there, he rose to regimental commander, brigade commander, and division commander, one step at a time. Those who tremble at his name in the north call him "The Pride of Heaven." During the Zhili-Fengtian War in the fifteenth year of the Republic, he was merely a cavalry army commander. He was able to pursue 10,000 soldiers of the Northwest Army with 500 cavalrymen in Zhangde, seizing half of their weapons. Can he not be considered a brave general? He has been in the military for thirty years, constantly promoted without a single day of retirement. It was during this resistance against the Japanese army that his name began to be known throughout the country. The general is 48 years old, named Xiufang. He has one son and one daughter. His son's name is Kui, with the alias Ziyuan. His daughter's name is Shuqin, and she is already married. His old mother understands righteousness. When retreating from Keshan, the general still insisted on fighting to the end to win the final victory. The old mother sent a soldier with a letter, saying, "The military situation has reached this point. One should prioritize the lives of the entire city of Longjiang. If it falls into enemy hands, how can we answer to the innocent people?" Therefore, the general did not lose the battle, but had to prioritize his mother's orders. At that time, Zhang Jinghui was still trying to persuade the general by telephone. The general replied, "If Fourth Master surrenders to the Japanese, then everyone will have their own ambitions. We cannot force each other. Ma Zhanshan believes himself to be a good man and will never submit. He will only fight to the end." Therefore, the general is still in Hailun, sharpening his weapons and preparing his horses, intending to counterattack, just as he originally intended, without any wavering.</p>
<p>The esteemed elder of Shanghai, known for his seniority, is Mr. Ma Xiangbo. Mr. Ma is from Dantu. This year he is already over ninety years old. In his early years, he traveled to France and became a devout Roman Catholic. He was a high-ranking monk. His brother, named Jianzhong, traveled abroad extensively and was particularly proficient in Chinese and Western languages. He wrote the book "Ma's Grammar," which scholars all admire. Mr. Ma excels at debate. Every time he takes the stage to speak, he is passionate and inspiring, able to explain things clearly and profoundly, earning the audience's applause. Twenty years ago, Aurora University in Xuhui was founded by the French. On Confucius' birthday, students used the name of respecting Confucius to leave the school together. They first formed Fudan at Avenue Haig, then moved to the Green Camp Public Office in Wusong, and elected Mr. Ma as the principal. At that time, Yu Youren was a student, using the pseudonym Liu Xueyu, calling himself "Senior Brother Xue," while the students called Mr. Ma "Old Man Ma." One of the school's servants, named Hong Xu, was also old and trusted by Mr. Ma. He also used these three characters as his talisman. Students who heard the name were immediately afraid of him, which shows his dignity. Later, he was burdened by a certain bank. A person named Song Xueqin sued Mr. Ma in the county court. Eventually, he relied on a large number of students holding banners to welcome him out. He enjoyed such admiration from the students. Liang Qichao initiated the Political News Society in Tokyo, Japan, inviting Mr. Ma to be the leader. He proclaimed "God and Me" as the declaration. Zhang Taiyan criticized him, saying, "The Han dynasty had Hu Guang, and the Ming dynasty had Hu Guang." The doctrine of the mean is the same. "The Han dynasty had Ma Liang, and the Qing dynasty had Ma Liang." The Xie and Mu families are also consistent throughout the ages. It is said that Mr. Ma's ancestor, Descartes, originally believed in "I think, therefore I am," which is similar to the theory that "I am thought." Therefore, Yu Hang ridiculed him. However, at this critical moment of survival, even though he can enjoy a long life, as a frail old man, he can still advocate "Saving the country with conscience," chasing the trend of the times, which is still derived from "God and Me." If people preserve this spark of intelligence and do not let it fade away, no matter how cunning the Japanese are, they will not be able to destroy us. Alas, these two Mas are indeed not something that inferior horses can match in their ability to see the dust on their trail.</p>
<h3>World Snippets</h3>
<p>— Haike</p>
<p>Stealing a look at a newspaper is a crime. Sitting on a tram, stealing a look over someone's shoulder at a newspaper that someone else is reading is a crime in the United States. Recently, a citizen in Washington was caught committing this crime. The owner of the newspaper argued with him and took him to the police station. He was eventually fined five pounds.</p>
<p>The loss from traffic congestion. The streets of London are extremely busy, and traffic jams often occur, making it impossible to pass. The cost of gasoline wasted by cars and the indirect losses from business delays amount to no less than 25 million pounds per year.</p>
<p>American female students' caps. In a certain place in the United States, first-year female college students must wear a specially prescribed cap. The cap is adorned with white and purple feathers, which are very beautiful.</p>
<p>Elephant bathing. There are many elephants in the London Zoo. They are required to bathe once a year to enhance their appearance. A special oil must be used in the bathing water. Each elephant requires more than eight gallons of oil.</p>
<h3>Good News Amidst the Boycott</h3>
<p>— Tianxiang</p>
<p>The economic invasion tactics of the violent Japanese are certainly abhorrent. However, to be fair, the various Japanese goods they transport to China do cater to the psychology of the buyers, striving to be practical and winning with ingenuity. This is something that cannot be denied. The diligence in their research and the spirit of imitation are indeed not to be ignored.</p>
<p>At this time when boycotting Japanese goods is urgently needed, who would dare to lag behind in promoting domestic products? I hope that all producers will do more research, taking applicability as a prerequisite. Their products must surpass imported goods. The Chinese people will naturally abandon foreign goods and use domestic products.</p>
<p>Speaking of minor items, writing brushes have been special products of our country for thousands of years. Since maritime transportation became available, Japanese people coming to China have regarded them as precious items. They have been imitating them in terms of quality. For decades, our country's products have remained the same, while the Japanese have been constantly improving, reversing the situation and selling well in China. According to recent surveys, this one item alone costs the country over 200,000 gold coins annually. Isn't it a pity that the Chinese people do not seek improvement and lose such huge profits?</p>
<p>The Japanese brushes transported to China are called "Baigui." The brush tips are fine and small, with appropriate flexibility. They are ideal for painting and calligraphy, allowing one to write with ease. A friend, Mr. Huang, is engaged in art and uses this product daily, but regrets that it is a Japanese product. He is determined to make his own brushes to recover the lost wealth and promote the boycott. I was told yesterday that he has raised funds to establish the Da Zhong Stationery Company in Hongrui Lane, Xinzha Road, specializing in the manufacture of "Baiyu" brushes. He has carefully studied the materials and imitated "Baigui." The results are excellent, and the prices are low. This is also good news amidst the boycott. Therefore, I am happy to record it.</p>
<p>Letter Received. Recently, the discussions by Dai Dixiangzhai in "Free Talk" and those in "Not Removing Court and Qi Fu's Talks" all involved matters related to Mr. Cai Yuanpei. The facts cited are all incorrect. We are making corrections. 1) Regarding the issue of surnames in the Civil Code discussed in the Legislative Yuan, Mr. Cai was not a member of the Legislative Yuan and did not participate. The so-called discussion by Dixiangzhai was a speech given at a public banquet of the education conference representatives in the Legislative Yuan. Mr. Cai only said that the family could be abolished in the future. At this time, surnames could be taken from either the father or the mother. Li Hu did not refute him. At that time, the Nanjing Min Sheng Daily published the general meaning of each person's words. Gan Yi probably got it from hearsay. 2) At the opening of the National Assembly, Mr. Cai did not personally write an ode. It seems like nitpicking for Not Removing Court and Qi Fu to accuse Mr. Cai of making inappropriate remarks based on the ode. A smile. Mr. Cai does not ask about external affairs while ill. If he occasionally talks about something, he does not want to get involved in arguments. Therefore, I am clarifying the above on his behalf. Yang Quan, December 26th.</p>
<p>Correction. On December 25th, the "Reminiscences from Dai Liang" referred to the Japanese minister Hideyoshi as being from the Daoguang period of the late Qing Dynasty. After investigation, it was found that Toyotomi Hideyoshi was named King of Japan during the reign of Emperor Shenzong of the Ming Dynasty. At this time of tense diplomacy, the wording of foreign propaganda should be especially cautious. Therefore, we are making a correction. Mei Hua.</p>
<h3>A Self-Made Jiangbei Man (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Xiaoruo</p>
<p>Mourning Shen Zhuowu</p>
<p>These days, the deaths of friends are becoming increasingly strange and cruel.</p>
<p>Xu Zhimo died tragically in the sky. I wrote a eulogy and a mourning poem. Not long after, the bad news came that Shen Zhuowu had died tragically in the water. One cannot help but feel a sense of the passing of old friends and the fleeting nature of life.</p>
<p>Zhuowu was from Rugao. He had been in Shanghai for at least thirty years. I heard that he was from a very poor family. His father passed away early, and he was raised to adulthood by his mother. He did not have the financial resources to receive a full education. When he arrived in Shanghai, he was truly alone, without any support. Relying on his ability, he forged ahead and created a career and a home with his bare hands. He managed the Evening News with such perseverance, finally succeeding and pioneering the Shanghai Evening News. He always did his best to help and guide his fellow villagers, regardless of whether they were seeking economic or career assistance. His heart was always warm towards his friends. In the eleventh year of the Republic, when Mr. Sun Yat-sen went to Guangdong due to a mutiny by his subordinates and then went to Shanghai, my father instructed me to visit him on his behalf to express condolences. Zhuowu accompanied me. I remember that evening, the two of us went together in a car. Amidst the withered willows and dry paulownia trees, the setting sun like blood, and the crows cawing in the evening, that section of Molier Road was a bit far from the city, and the scenery was quiet and secluded. After entering, a person received a card and immediately led us to Mr. Sun's study upstairs. I first presented my father's letter and conveyed the intention of the visit. Mr. Sun asked about my father's health and the state of affairs in Nantong. He received me with unusual sincerity. At that time, I was about to go abroad to study industry. Mr. Sun instructed me on what China's industrial improvement needed and the path to explore. He immediately wrote a message on his English book "The International Development of China" and sent it to me to read. His attitude of promoting juniors and teaching tirelessly left a deep impression on me at the time. I then believed that Mr. Sun's ability to inspire was truly incredible. I met a great figure in China through Zhuowu's introduction. This is a commemoration that I will never forget in my life.</p>
<p>This time, Zhuowu's death is said to have angered some of his fellow villagers. Of course, all of Zhuowu's friends should be extremely angry. I am also one of them. It is human nature to be angry and blame the Dada Company. How could I not feel that this time Zhuowu's misfortune happened on a Dada Company ship, which is related to me? My sadness and sorrow are naturally even more unspeakable. The Dada Company has been established for nearly twenty years. In the past, the company's various organizations were extremely simple, but the business was developing more and more every day, progressing from stability to consolidation. It was not until last year that the shareholders' meeting was officially convened and the board of directors was organized. Various rules and regulations were also established and promulgated, and the organization was gradually completed. Everything was on the right track. I never expected that within this year, two disasters, "Daji" and "Dade," would occur in succession. Perhaps no one can answer this karmic consequence of seeking perfection and being destroyed.</p>
<h3>A Letter from the Common People to the Soldiers (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Common People</p>
<p>We were born in such an unpromising era. No one has ever fantasized about hoping that you will invade neighboring countries, but defending the country and protecting the people is the foolish hope that we common people have for our armed compatriots in our dreams. Jilin has fallen into the hands of foreign tribes. You are probably from the background of common people. Is it possible that the patriotism of those who are armed is inferior to the common people who are unarmed? The common people are pitifully ashamed, and are so angry that they want to commit suicide. What about you?</p>
<p>Now, General Ma Zhanshan of Heilongjiang is resisting the enemy with an isolated army. In the snowy and icy Northeast, he is fighting against the violent Japanese with the determination to break the boat and sink the ship. The common people respectfully wish General Ma victory and truly acknowledge that General Ma's officers and soldiers are the model soldiers of China. They truly deserve the support paid for by the common people's blood and sweat. The common people have nothing at this time, and they will save the wages they earn from doing work, even refraining from smoking yellow tobacco, accumulating them to send to General Ma and his loyal and brave armed compatriots to express their respect. At the same time, the common people have a few fantasies.</p>
<p>1) If I, a common person, were a soldier, I would definitely carry a gun and go to General Ma's unit to help kill the bandits.</p>
<p>2) If I, a common person, were leading a soldier, I would definitely lead the unit to General Ma's unit to help kill the bandits, regardless of whether the superiors approve or not.</p>
<p>3) If I, a common person, were a military officer with a position, I would definitely lead my entire unit to the Northeast to assist General Ma to strengthen the momentum, and would never just issue some deceitful telegrams.</p>
<p>4) If everyone indifferently watches General Ma and the loyal and brave warriors being annihilated by the violent Japanese without any assistance, and Heilongjiang is occupied by the violent Japanese again, the common people will only commit suicide to avoid bearing the boring military expenses in the future.</p>
<p>5) If the common people commit suicide, and many common people commit suicide! Because they are unwilling to be slaves who meekly obey, they all wish to commit suicide. At that time, I am afraid that there will be no one to cultivate the fields and no one to do the work. There will also be no one to support the useless soldiers who do not defend the country. At that time, what will happen to the commanders, the military leaders, and what else...?</p>
<p>I know that in my haste, I will inevitably say something inappropriate. Let people praise or criticize as they wish. I respectfully wish</p>
<p>Peace to the armed compatriots of the Republic of China. Common People</p>

<p>▲ Gold Price Rises Fifteen Taels</p>
<p>Discovered a new high price after the capture period. Yesterday, the spot gold suddenly trended to a peak, already seeing a new record after the swap period. However, advances and retreats were uneven, with a difference of over eighteen taels between the daily high and low. The result was a sharp increase of fifteen taels. Each firm supplied and demanded, with intentions remaining firm and high. It initially soared, probably due to the decline in silver prices. Subsequently, there were more sellers than buyers, and with the opening being too high, a reaction occurred. Foreign exchange rose and then loosened, and then declined further, retreating 680 taels. The future market suddenly flew forward, with quick and orderly progress. This was because drafts became tighter, and it was also rumored that India was selling silver. Therefore, each firm surged like a whirlwind, striving to purchase. It suddenly rose by more than ten taels, abruptly reaching 690 taels. Probably the British and American exchanges had already shrunk, and finally, many parties slightly divested, returning within 90 taels. All swaps seemed to loosen, roughly within ten taels, it is said.</p>
<p>▲ The opening added ten taels and then saw little progress. It immediately added ten taels at the early opening, to 686 taels, as large as before. American silver had already fallen by a quarter, private telegraphs by an eighth. However, this price was too high and not easy to sell. Furthermore, Dalian Bang, Yifeng, Tong Taichang, Qian Changxiang, Zhifeng, Yongfeng, Yongyi Feng, and Yong, etc. came to sell, causing the price to gradually fall by over seven taels. There was only a one or two tael margin until around 9:30, only 78 taels and five cents. As for the American gold for the near term, Mitsui bought it at 33 yuan 75, and then Zhejiang, etc. sold it at 23625 for February and March. Before long, Shanghai absorbed January 75, adding two taels to 80 taels and five cents. British gold opened without change, retreating to 78 taels and eight cents. Zhifeng, Yong, etc. came to purchase, and Zhengjin and HSBC mutually traded March American gold at 6875, immediately rising by three taels. At 9:50, it was 82 taels. Yifeng, Tianfeng, Yong, etc. sold out. Hua Bank sold March American gold at 75. Mitsui bought January 875, so the price was again reduced by three or four taels, around 10 o'clock it was 78 taels and two cents. Suddenly, it rebounded by over three taels. Japanese merchants made February British gold at 625, resulting in 81 taels and seven cents. Then, Yuan Mao Yong, Qian Changxiang, Zhifeng, Yong Wanxing, etc. divested, Shanghai issued March American gold at 6875. Market conditions softened, and by 10:30, it was only 76 taels. After that, Yu Da Bingxing, Zhifeng Yongheng, Chang Yonghong, Kang Yong Wanxing, etc. took this opportunity to purchase, and Mitsui absorbed April American gold at 75. The Japanese bank mutually traded March British gold at 11 pence 5625, so the gold price rose by over five taels. Until 11:30, it was 81 taels and a half. Only Dade Cheng, etc. sold out. Until the noon close at 78 taels and a half. The quoted price was still 725 taels or so, deducting 45-46 taels to 43-44 taels, around 50 taels at noon. ▲ In the afternoon, the buying trend flourished and soared straight up. The afternoon market opened at 80 taels. Because after the noon close, Mumbai reported a small five anna, and then rose step by step. Yuan Mao, Bing Xing, Chunfa, Yong Sen, Chang Yonghong, Kang Yong Tongchun, Yuan Mao Yong, etc. all competed to purchase. Especially with the news of India selling spot silver coming, the hearts of the people were excited. The short sellers rushed to cover.

<h3>Year-End Settlements and Interest Rates</h3>
<p>The Interest Rate Soars by 0.07 to 0.08</p>
<p>Yesterday's financial market was mostly settling due to the year-end, so there was not much business activity. Bank settlements were mostly about clearing accounts, reaching over 10 million, and receiving payments of several million. Regular settlements were extensive, and processing procedures were cumbersome, so office hours were extended. At the time of writing, details were not yet available. In the market, the monthly interest rate was 7.222375% in the morning and 7.22225% in the afternoon, a slight decrease of 0.005% from the previous day's afternoon market. The interest rate on silver was 3% in both the morning and afternoon, the same as the previous afternoon. Additional interest was 1.056%. Bank listings were 0.012%.

<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Government Bonds Surge</p>
<p>▲ Retail Investors Jump in, Ranging from 3 to 7-8 Yuan</p>
<p>▲ Futures Rise and Then Fall, with Mixed Results</p>
<p>▲ February Futures Have Opened but No Transactions</p>
<p>Yesterday (December 29th), the Shanghai Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange's bond market saw February futures open for trading, but with no transactions. January futures saw significant price fluctuations, and trading was still active. Spot trading opened for all bonds except the 96 issue, so the market was quite active. Regarding the price movements of various bonds yesterday, the market was optimistic at the opening, and all parties believed that the central government's reorganization was well underway, and the future situation was better than before. Market sentiment was lively, and demand exceeded supply for all bond prices, leading to a strong continuation of the previous settlement's rise, with each bond rising by about 1-2 yuan. Later, buying sentiment gradually weakened, and sellers gradually gained the upper hand. Although the political situation seemed slightly better, the Sino-Japanese diplomatic situation was still serious, and tax revenues were not abundant, so the bond market environment was still not too optimistic. Therefore, in the second round of trading, prices gradually fell back, but the trend was still peaceful. In the last round of trading, the decline intensified. As a result, compared to the previous settlement, futures, except for customs duties which rose by 1.8 yuan, and consolidated tax which rose by 0.5 yuan, all other bonds were lower by several jiao. In spot trading, only the demobilization bond fell by 0.2 jiao. With considerable investment from retail investors, the increase ranged from 3-4 yuan to a significant 7-8 yuan. Observing the bond market's situation, it is now approaching the end of the year, and it is difficult to expect major developments in the market, and prices are not likely to rebound quickly. Total spot trading for the day was 68,300 yuan. January futures were 5.4 million yuan in the morning and 1.97 million yuan in the afternoon, totaling 7.37 million yuan.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>Yarn Market: Small Shorts Covering</p>
<p>The yarn market was slightly firm due to general profit-taking short covering at the end of the year, which caused the market to rise slightly. However, the overall trend remained flat, and the disturbances in Northeast China were intensifying. Most psychological sentiments leaned towards selling due to the financial emergency. Fortunately, Sichuan merchants were still actively purchasing spot yarn.</p>
<p>▲ Manbiao (Machine-made Standard) Rose by 0.06-0.07 Qian: The Manbiao market opened lower due to weak American cotton, and there was a lack of buyers in the market. All months rose by 0.04, 0.06, and 0.07 Qian. The afternoon was flat, with January rising by 0.03 Qian, and the remaining months seeing little change. The total daily transaction volume was 11,600 bales. The selling merchants were Hengde (700 bales), Senkang (850 bales), and Shenchang (250 bales). The buying merchants were Gengfeng (2,950 bales), Tongyu (400 bales), and Taixing (650 bales). The closing prices are recorded below.</p>

<h3>Standard Cotton: Bullish Forces Strong</h3>
<p>The cotton market remained firm, and bullish sentiment was unusually strong. Due to the sharp rise at the end of last year, it is expected that the New Year will see a prosperous trend, and the bullish forces are particularly strong. However, the overseas cotton market situation is very bleak. All factories' demand for spot cotton is currently anticipated, and funds are very tight. Prices in various producing areas are gradually easing due to the arrival of the year-end, and no one is taking delivery. However, the current situation has a high possibility of stabilizing.</p>
<p>▲ Hanbiao (Hankou Standard) Slightly Better by 0.03 Qian: The Hanbiao market opened, and although American cotton was weak, market sentiment was firm. All months rose by 0.005 to 0.02 Qian.

<h3>Piece Goods</h3>

<p>Optimistic Automobile Business - Pei</p>
<p>▲ 1931 Can Also Be Considered Not Bad</p>
<p>In one more day, it will be the New Year's Day of 1932. In the past year of 1930, according to a report in the Continental Daily, the automobile industry in Shanghai had considerable profits for most merchants. The outlook for 1932 is also very optimistic. Although all parts of the country except Shanghai were affected by political and economic factors, the prosperity of the automobile business in the months after 1921 was unprecedented since 1929.</p>
<p>This year, all the famous automobile merchants in Shanghai have made profits. The year-end bonus means most of the staff get a share, which proves the optimism is accurate. It is said that this bonus distribution is the first time since 1928. It was never heard of that there were such grand distribution before 1928.</p>
<p>In addition to Buick's new cars, which have arrived in Shanghai, the new 1932 model cars of other brands are on their way and have not yet arrived in Shanghai. Even if they have arrived, it is only a small number. Automobile dealers in Shanghai have great expectations for the future. As for the delay in new cars, the fact that various dealers already have extremely high sales proves that it is not about whether they sell 1931 models or pre-sell 1932 models. The rental car business in 1931 was very impressive, and improved significantly compared to previous years. Although there are many newly opened rental car companies to replace those whose business has failed, the operations of several large rental car companies are not bad. Therefore, the bonus distribution is very generous. The cancellation of the signing and accounts receivable system for rental car companies has greatly increased their profits. Recently, most rental car companies in Shanghai have implemented a cash transaction system. Business operations are very stable. In this way, accounting, collection, and various expenses can be reduced. As a result, the number of bad debts in 1931 was only half that of 1930. This applies to both Chinese and foreign rental car companies. According to the plans of most car companies, many new cars and various replacement items will be added in 1932 to promote the development of the rental car business.</p>
<p>The development of various automobile merchants in Shanghai selling parts has also been more prosperous than in previous years. Whether the tire merchants are American, British, or French, the number of tires they sell is extremely large. This is because the number of people equipping cars in Shanghai is increasing day by day, so the business of parts merchants is booming. The battery business also had its best year this year.</p>
<p>Automobile dealers in Shanghai believe that the number of people buying cars in Shanghai is increasing day by day, and that traffic and road administration in the city are improving day by day. Therefore, the development of the automobile business is extremely optimistic. However, most of them are calm-minded people who will not simply show their joy on their faces. What they hold is that more Shanghainese will buy cars in 1932. The used car trading market has also been very developed recently. With the launch of new cars, this business is extremely active again.</p>

<h3>Shaanxi Province</h3>
<p>Recent Work of the Highway Bureau, Learning and Moving</p>
<p>Shaanxi Province is remotely located in the Northwest. Mountain ranges present obstacles to transportation. Construction of transportation infrastructure is truly imperative. Therefore, there was a plan to proceed in stages. The first step was to investigate county roads in each county and survey the route for a car road from Feng County to Nan.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>Zheng. The second step was to erect two long-distance telephone lines, Xi'an-Hanzhong and Xing'an-Hanzhong, and to investigate and design the Hanyang automobile route. The third step was to connect long-distance telephone branch lines in each county and to construct the Xi'an-Hanzhong trunk automobile road, while also organizing and repairing county roads in each county. These would be carried out simultaneously during the implementation of the second and third steps of the plan. Consequently, the Provincial Highway Bureau is intensifying its work. The recent situation is described as follows:</p>
<p>▲New Automobile Station Established in Shaanxichuan: The Longhai Railway has now been extended to near Tongguan. The Longhai Special Express has also been extended to Shanzhou from October 10th. The provincial government, considering that the express train reaches Shanzhou, believes that provincial automobiles must connect with the train to facilitate joint transportation. The Highway Bureau has established a temporary third-class automobile branch station in Shanzhou, dispatching cars to Shanzhou on schedule every day to serve travelers. The Longhai train departing from Xuzhou arrives in Shanzhou at 6:50 AM every morning. Provincial highway automobiles will arrive at the station at that time.</p>
<p>Sand Paving on the Shaopingdian Section of the Xi'an-Tongguan Road: The Highway Bureau, noting the poor condition of the section between Baqiao and Shaopingdian on the Xi'an-Tongguan Road, added fine sand this month to solidify the road surface. The total labor cost is over one thousand yuan. Except for the low-lying area around Huaxian on the Xi'an-Tongguan Road, which often accumulates water that cannot be drained, making it easily damaged after rain, especially the area east of Baqiao to Shaopingdian, where the soil is clay. After even a slight rain, the soil becomes wet and soft, and wheel tracks quickly turn into deep grooves. After the rain, when the weather clears, the soil hardens, and the ground becomes uneven again. The vehicle shakes, and it is repeatedly repaired, making maintenance difficult. It is also time-consuming and laborious, and uneconomical. To facilitate transportation and consider financial resources, the bureau has first paved this section with a sand surface, hoping it will last longer. The average length of the sandy road surface is about eight li.</p>
<p>Testing Clay Water Pipes in Sichuan: Shaanxi Province's highways lack waterproofing facilities. After each rain, accumulated water often overflows and breaches the road, making repairs difficult. This not only makes maintenance difficult but also obstructs traffic. The Highway Bureau plans to bury clay water pipes in necessary places for drainage. This month, it sent personnel to join kiln merchants outside Xi'an City to test a clay pipe sample. The results indicate that it can be used. However, according to the kiln merchants, firing the kiln takes three months, which is time-consuming. Moreover, the number of water pipes needed for each route is large, making the supply insufficient. It has now ordered two hundred pipes to be tested separately. Each clay pipe costs about two yuan, including labor, materials, and transportation.</p>
<p>Repairing Four Bridges in Lintong: The four bridges along the Xi'an-Tongguan Road in Lintong County, namely Dongmen Bridge, Erli Bridge, Sanli Bridge, and Xihe Bridge, were washed away by heavy rain in August of this year. Upon receiving the report from the Lintong County Magistrate, the Construction Department ordered the Highway Bureau to investigate. New-style Ford convertible sedan parked in front of the newly completed Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall in Guangzhou.</p>
<p>Design and Repair: After investigation by the Highway Bureau, the wooden beams of Dongmen and Sanli bridges were broken, and cars had to take a detour. The pier of Erli Bridge was damaged, and the wooden beams were about to become loose. The wooden materials on both ends of Xihe Bridge were widened and decayed, and the bridge railings were washed away. All need to be rebuilt to ensure durability. Based on current economic capacity, the plan is to first build the bridge piers solid and temporarily use wood for the beams. When the economy is more prosperous in the future, stone strips will be used for permanent solidity. Dongmen Bridge is 20 feet long, Sanli Bridge is 16 feet long, Ximen Bridge is 57 feet long, and Xihe Bridge has four piers in the middle, leaving five openings because the bridge body is longer. Construction on Dongmen Bridge began on August 31st and was completed at the end of September. Construction on Erli Bridge began on September 11th and was completed on September 13th. Construction on Sanli Bridge began on August 29th and was completed on September 16th. Construction on Xihe Bridge began on September 19th and was completed in early October. Now all the bridges have been repaired and solidified, and travelers no longer have to sing the difficulty of travel.</p>
