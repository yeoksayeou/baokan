<h3 id="c18">美參議員瓊森之言 <a href="#c18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>二十七日美參議員瓊森在舊金山商務總會演說。痛斥日軍之强佔我「東北。」絶非正式之戰爭。純爲乘鄰國軍積弱而侵犯其境。並謂「歐戰時條約等於廢紙」之名言。今日「東北」之事。適爲其一大好例證。故彼於信賴形同具文之條約者。尤力予抨擊瓊森之言。雖在維護人類和平之一原則上。容有討論之餘地。而其於目前之事實。誠可謂爲揭開悶葫盧。一語破的。</p>
<p>溯自歐戰而後世界各國之政治家外交家致力於和平運動誠可謂癉心竭力。繼續不已。自凡爾塞和會後。所謂海牙會議。保安會議。軍縮會議。華府會議。國際聯盟。九國公約。非戰公約。舉凡足以表示維護和平之誠意之字句。無不一一從字典中搜出而綴成條文。信誓旦旦。一若今後世界眞可籍此偶像式之「公約」或「盟約」或「决議。」而獲得確切之保障者。然而此和平之幻夢與盟約之等於廢紙。和平機關之等於虚設世界各國政治家外交家之激昻演說。狂熱集會。等於扮演滑稽喜劇玩萬花筒。都爲日本今日在我東北斷然不顧一切之行爲所撤底揭露。而瑍森於此事實。則更加以詳細之說明與註釋。世界各國之政治家。外交家對於瓊森之演辭。其或認爲過激之論乎。但眼前事實。誠爲如此。瓊森不過爲之大膽說破耳。</p>
<p>日軍所加諸我東北之暴行。自九月十八以至今日。已將一月有半。國聯兩次决議。非戰公約協約國正式發出備忘錄。而日人悍然不顧。日軍　盤踞於我東北也如故。其暴行之繼續發展也亦如故。據二十八電訊國聯行政秘書長德魯蒙於駐比日大使游日内瓦時。乘機勸日本撤兵。日政府置不理會。又二十七日日陸軍省討論東省駐軍問題雖决定撤退東省現有駐軍。但同時又决定派遣相富兵力替換。並仍擬實行增兵。是其毫無撤兵誠意。蓋可想見.盟約上之約定者如彼。而事實上之表現者又如此。而國際協約國對此公然背棄盟約蹂躪公理破壞和平之暴行徒作無謂之勸告。敷衍之决議。以及枉費之辯論。不肯依據盟約之規定。予以正當有效之裁制。是非在事實上顯明說明條約之爲廢紙而何耶。</p>
<p>國人其諦聽瓊森之言。依賴形同具文之條約。無異依賴冰山。不求自助。但乞靈於偶像式之盟約。豈僅無能。抑亦無恥。巴爾福曾有言。「中國應審度世事之變遷。自謀改革。」蘇門亦曾有言。「各事應由中國自謀。外國並不能援助中國」惟自助乃能自救。惟自助乃能博得他國之同情。我政府我國民在今日危困之時機其深思其猛醒。</p>

<p>哈爾濱通信、張海鵬自得悉省軍動員抵抗後、即退取守勢、雙方隔江相持、（因江橋已炸斷）張部逆軍以泰來縣爲第一道防線、惟其主力部隊、當時並未出動、祗將修理河工之千五百人臨時編制成軍、爲騎兵先鋒隊、佈於前線、此種行動、實甚狼狽、因駐塔城子屯墾軍之袁旅、（現已改編成師）已經反正、制張軍之背、且張軍内部、又起潰變、假使當時無日軍爲之後援、張軍已如甕中之鱉、不難一鼓成擒、現在張自身、仍駐洮南、命其長子質明、駐守泰來、震東縣亦在其佔據之下、故張尙佔有三縣之地也、二十一日下午、雙方又有接觸、激戰三小時、有日軍助戰開砲、張卒不支而退、二十二日上午十一時、有日飛機四架、飛至大興站、（距昻昻溪約十六里）投彈八枚、爆炸七彈、幸有一大彈着落沙土上未炸、故僅傷一二士兵、馬占山主席、已於今日（二十二）接事、禮節甚简、行禮後即開軍事會議、大體主戰、有立時將江橋修復、以便進攻之說、今日由張副司令轉來張海鵬電、意在辯明心跡、並無奪取江省之念、不過因日軍包圍、不堪威逼云云、亦可想見其理屈詞窮、但事已顯然、無可挽救矣、</p>
<p>前日推舉赴洮南歡迎張海鵬之各法團代表楊香秋（商會主席）等八人、因省方臨時接張副司令急電、堅持主戰、不得不改變主張、積極抵抗、張行至中途聞訊、大爲憤懣、幾欲遷怒於各代表、而加以毒手、嗣經人百般解釋、謂各代表所負之使命、不過代表地方人民之意思、唯一目的、在希望保持和平、免啓戎端、至於北平方面之以命令變更地方長官（當時除謝參謀長唐副官長外、其他要人均暫時避難）之主張、實非代表權力所能阻止云云、張至此始稍諒解、然尙氣憤難平、故一時不放各代表回省、直至二十日、始派一親信知友名姜鳴九者、年亦在花甲以外、以私人資格、伴送各代表回省、取道長春哈爾濱、聞暗中尙附帶調和妥協之使命、於此八代表中、尙留王靜修（省府參議兼敎育長）一人作質、不知是何用</p>
<p>意、二十二日馬新主席、專爲此事召集會議、議决再推舉馬子丹（省府委員）等三人隨來、使偕赴洮南、以交換意見云、（二十四日）</p>

<p>「急來抱佛脚」。這是我國人最大的毛病平時渾渾噩噩、祗知道得過且過。等到禍患臨頭。方才着急。如此次東省事件。彼日人之謀找。處心積慮。巳非一年半載。試問我国或人平日準備如何。我國雖號稱擁有二百萬的大兵。但是中國兵祗有對内的勇氣。外侮侵來。却是抱着不抵抗主義。因此·各地人民激於石憤。就紛紛起來組織義勇軍。不過這種「急來抱佛脚」的組織。怎樣抵禦得過有組織有訓練的日寇。所以我希望今後政府一方面。要養兵對外。不要再事内爭。人民一方面。再不要做急來抱佛脚的功夫。要有永久確定的組織。這樣方足以禦外侮而拒日寇哩。</p>

<p>島夷卉服首見禹貢。秦漢以來。罕被倭患。蓋以其俗愛鮮華地多饒沃。五百七十三郡。率皆樂士環以大海。君臣自保。不覬觎中國也。自漢武帝滅朝鮮後。即至吾國朝貢。（朝鮮在戰國時。故屬燕。秦爲遼東外徼漢興。爲其遠難守。復修遼東。故塞至浿水。即朝鮮平壤城東。今曰大通江　）漢光武建武二年。倭奴國王遣使來貢獻。又安帝永福元年亦遣使來貢。洎魏明帝景福三年。遣大夫難叔米復來貢獻。及晋武帝時。亦嘗入貢。至宋武帝永福二年。倭王讚親來入覲。文帝元嘉二年。讚復來貢。並率其弟珍立。時遣使來吾國。迨元嘉二十年。珍之子濟立來貢。濟薨子興立。入孝武帝大明六年尙入覲。興死。弟武立。至順帝昇平二年。猶遣使上貢。且進表焉厥後朝貢之禮。史不絶書。見　中士之文物而來華修學者。船舶又絡繹不斷。甚至有居留十餘年而始歸國者。隋唐兩朝。學者與其僧侣。來吾國者。有多至五百人以上日本傾嚮上國。亦可謂盛已。自是吾中國之文化。漸輸於三島。而一切法令等等亦皆爲彼士所采取。嗚呼。當時吾中國之有裨於蕞爾島夷者爲何如。苟一譒其已往之史蹟。而貌爲親善。實行其侵略之暴舉者。亦可以已矣。</p>
<p>日本入寇我海疆。始自有明嘉靖二十九年秋七月。犯我浙東三十五年春三月。以趙文華胡宗獻督軍務討倭。夏五月。復遣趙文華視師四十二年冬十一月。倭又陷我興化府。總兵余大猷。副總兵戚繼光擊破之。至萬曆二十二年夏五月。倭復侵我朝鮮。二十六年冬十一月倭始遁去。我軍分道追擊之。朝鮮乃平。自嘉靖至萬曆五十年間。日人之犯我屢屢。時我雖爲國賊嚴嵩柄政。而貽誤軍機至於陵替。一任小寇之鴟張跋扈。然猶能命將遣卒驅除不戢。俾勿再内犯。又能平定朝鮮。以靖附庸而撫外服者。亦可見我中國撻伐之聲威尙堪一震於宇内也。嘉靖三十五年一役。倭衆六千餘人。轉鬥數千餘里。歷八十餘日。終爲我應天巡撫曹邦輔所殲。沈良材繼之。遂以捷聞。嗣雖爲忌者貪功。以折其銳氣。至令倭氛復熾。論者惜之。然我國躬擐甲胄。與夫執殳前驅。殺敵効命以死於疆塲者。至二萬餘人。亦可光我國史。以供後世讀史者之一壯觀矣。嗚呼。今之握兵符而專軍閫者。不知見此亦有動於衷乎。雖軍旅之事今昔不同。而中外强弱之形。有不可以拘墟之見騰諸口者。然回溯往蹟。亦可以鑑已。</p>

<p>全由婦女主持的工廠。英京倫敦。有一家工廠。完全由婦女主持。而不許男子們投身其間的。這工廠在六年以前。由二十位少婦共同創辦。伊們要顯些本領給全世界瞧瞧。不要以爲這類機器工程的事業。是只有男子幹得了的。廠長是一位愛希培來女士。ＭissAAshberry是工程學會的會員。該會的女會員只有二人。而女士即居其一。廠中的工匠以至寫字間中的職員。完全是婦女。連奔走伺應的侍者與在外　攬營業的跑街。也無一不是女子。開業以來。異常發達。最近與航空部與馬哥尼無線電報公司訂了合同。供給他們的用品。這是很難得的事情。愛希培來女士曾對新聞記者說。「我們很驕傲。在國内能有這麽一家完全由婦女主持的工廠我們的員工。單是在廠中工作。還不以爲滿足。有好幾個人都進了夜校。學習圖畫數學與機械學。因爲伊們將來也想做工程學會的會員。我們的工作。大半是製造飛機與無線電的最繁細的附件。我們確是精於此道的。」</p>

<p>際此國難聲中。吾人無心娱樂。然國産電影。似亦不可不提倡者也。輓近天一公司。創製國産慕維通有聲電影。甫於日前告成問世。假座新光大戲院公映。予應該公司書記譚竹筠君之招。前往觀光。觀畢歸來。捉筆記之如下。</p>
<p>歌塲春色劇本。爲名小說家姚蘇鳳氏手筆。又請黎錦暉氏特編歌曲。更覺錦上添花。宣景琳女士飾歌女李慧芳。翩然登場。歌新曲青春之樂。珠喉宛轉。不同凡響。博得觀衆贊許。浦驚鴻女士飾慧芳之侍女芳姑歌唱亦清晰悅耳。女士在攝片時爲火酒灼傷。卒至香消玉碎。今茲音影尙存。而人事已非。令人不勝長太息也。</p>
<p>今年我國水災奇重。各地多成澤國。哀鴻遍野。慘不忍覩。故片中穿插海上各慈善團體舉行賑災游藝大會。特請朱子橋王曉籟二先生演講水災情形。王先生一口紹興官話。聆之發噱。并聘電影女明星。宣景琳女士唱江南好。揀花風。楊耐梅女士唱寒夜曲。徐琴芳女士唱芳草美人曲吳素馨女士唱蘇三起解。紫羅蘭女士作紫羅蘭舞餘如陳玉梅。陸劍芬。章擁翠陶雅雲。蔣耐芳。及秦哈哈。蕭正中張振鐸陳一棠。孫敏等男女明星二十餘人。頗爲熱閙。至發音之清晰劇情之曲折尤爲難得云。</p>

<p>— 天笑</p>
<p>鄉下人自從上次倒過了上海一回以後，他就時時刻刻想念到上海。喫飯也提到上海，睡覺也提到上海，拉矢也提到上海。「怪不得那些黄毛丫頭。一到了上海，便不肯再回到鄉下來。就是我老頭子，白相了一趟上海，也時時想着它，眞不想我偌大年紀，犯了相思病。不是别的相思病，就是掛念上海的相思病罷了。」他在工作之餘，手裏揑了一根一尺多長的旱烟桿，一把紫砂茶壺，赤了脚，敞了胸，坐在門前一張竹榻上，和那些乘風凉的，不曾到過上海的鄰舍們，很驕傲地說着。「老伯伯！你幾時又要到上海去了呢？二個十七八歲的村姑，名字喚做阿水金的，仰起了頭，在夕陽影裏，映照出一頭晒黄的頭髮癡癡的很羡慕的望着他「我嗎？不久就要去了。阿水金！你倘然要到了上海去，再也不想回來了。可惜你爸爸，你媽，不放你去。一鄉下人的語氣中，挾有一點兒誘惑性質。「我們不要到上海去。」阿水金的媽，堅决的如此說。</p>
<p>「爲什麽呢？」鄉下人問。</p>
<p>「上海不是一個好地方。前年子我們大老官（註一）家裏一個細娘，（註二因爲伊的舅姆在上海帮人家（註三）所以把伊帶到上海去做小大姐。誰知到了後來，登了把勢人家去，再也不肯回來。那個細娘，已經給了人家的了，男家要討人了，後來還吃了一塲官司。我們阿水金，從三歲就給了前村阿大的兒子小毛的了。上海不是好地方，我們不要去。</p>
<p>「也有發財的。那個小阿姨，不是去年寄錢給伊的兄弟，在鄉下造房子嗎？」這是一個坐近爪棚，名喚阿小弟的老頭子，正在喝着燒酒，自得其樂。</p>
<p>「哼！小阿姨的錢是那裏來的？不是當婊子賣身體得來得嗎？上海是個齷齪世界，連坐的車子，也是奇奇怪怪，什麽呌做王八車，烏龜電車？」</p>
<p>「阿水金娘！你聽差了。不是王八車，却是黄包車。不是烏龜電車，却是無軌電車。」鄉下人哈哈大笑，表示他是老上海，見多識廣。</p>

<h3 id="c174">最近的德國文壇兩個女詩人 <a href="#c174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— 莫京</p>
<p>在德國當代年輕的女詩人之中、魯絲休門和愛列加密脫勒要算在文壇上獲得了確實的地位了、第一個是在幾年之前獲得了一般的承認、現在任何當代德國抒情詩代表作選裏面總一定包含她的作品了、第二個一個更年輕的女子丨她是二十三歲丨曾經博得這樣著名的德國批評家如歐史脫列叟的好評、眞的、一自他對她的作品的批評、大約在一年前刋載在柏林的文學評論報上以來、她也可以認爲是「成名」了、</p>
<p>魯絲休門自一個最爲有趣的個性、她一八九九年生於漢堡、她早年的少女時代就消磨在那裏、然後她到繆尼許去鑽研藝術、而獲得了對於她的彫刻的非常之好的當地的批評、這彫刻的事業她後來即奉之爲終身的職業、這一件事是値得注意、因爲六年之前討論她的詩如「造形的抒情詩」的那個批評家、即以許多證明、表示她終身所奉獻的二種藝術形式其間所存在的關係、魯鷥休門第一部詩集是在一九二○年出版、呌做「敎堂」、看了這詩集、我們可以說一句這一個詩人是個天主敎徒、她的信仰和哲學的背景幾一例地染了她的作品、四年之後又出現了一部呌做ＤieGlashergkinder的詩劇、並另一本收集起來呌做「發芽之地」的抒情詩集、一九二六年、又一本抒情詩「熱情之書」出版了、於是獲得了一般的承認、同時、魯絲休門也發表短篇小說和關於藝術方面的文章、她更以别的藝術方式産生了製作、有幾幅她最好的著色的木刻裝飾她最近收集起來的詩集「可信的事物」、她且以同所附的詩一樣博得讚許的畫裝飾了「熱情之書」、</p>
<p>檢察魯絲休門全部作品的人可以見到她的作品是表現一種從「發芽之地」底熱情之丰富到「熱情之書」的婉約的嚴肅的顯著的進化、她的「可信的事物」一書是平常事物底神秘性之簡單的顯示丨丨丨人的肉體看來不過綫是精神生活的一種工具、人類的聯想是在簡樸、動人的詩中表現、全部的詩集是對於從根本的現實没有走得遠的人之一種純粹的歡喜、</p>
<p>愛列如密脫勒無論如何不是一個「寫實者」、也堅執着簡單重要的現實、愛、康健、清晨的呼吸、和春之狂悅、有幾首最好的詩是情詩、是屬於一種處女的熱情之詩、它們是獻致詩人的愛人的、其表現之純潔眞摯是逈無疑義、在這詩集中還有一首囂俄的Ｂooz的出色的翻譯、它的牧歌的美是極好和合着詩人的氣質雖當有時候她要激揚到一種熱情的修辭底調子、</p>
<p>讀當代德國詩的人令將抱着興味懸盼爰列加密脫勒的第二部抑情詩之出世在她第一部「ＤankDesLebens」裏已預示着Ｐromise</p>
<h3 id="c175">法國彫刻家伯納逝世 <a href="#c175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— 德明</p>
<p>現代法蘭西彫刻界是成鼎足三分的形勢的、那三只鼎是丨三大彫刻家丨是台畢窗（Ｄospiao、其生平與藝術記者曾爲文介紹、登於本年一月本刋上）、梅瑤爾（Ｍaillol）和伯納（ＪosophBoroard）、現伯氏以逝世聞、這非但是法蘭西藝術界的重大損失、實也是全世界藝術界的損失、哀悼之餘、謹述伯氏之生平與藝術如下、</p>
<p>伯納以一八六六年生於維埃納（Ｖienne、非奥國京城維也納Ｖienna、此爲法國之一縣、讀者幸勿誤會、）他的出生地位於龍恩河（Ｒhone）上、其地河水縈帶、羣山糾紛、正是一個富於幻想的少年培養元氣的適當環境、伯氏很幼小的時候、已能在木頭上彫刻人物鳥獸等、到十一歲的時候、他進而刻石、彫刻了一對獅子、放在他父親的園子中、他的彫刻家的事業可以說是在那時開始的、後來他得到埃納市政府的資助、入里昻美術學校攻習彫刻、十九歲時、轉入國立美術學院、他進學院之後不久、就發覺學院敎師敎法之錯誤、因此他就不去遵從那種錯誤陳腐的成法、而以模特兒爲其唯一之範本、忠實地製作着、他知道素描是練習手腕、最好的東西、所以他每晚勤習素描、結果手腕大爲嫺熟、彫刻前不須先作石膏模型、而直接刻石、無從失手之虞、（普通一般彫刻家都先作石膏模型、然後刻之於石、蓋因未習素描或習而不精、手腕不順熟、直接刻石、恐有失手之虞、故多不敢輕易嘗試、）他的彫刻簡直就是在石頭上作素描、隨手揮灑、無不如意、從伯氏的藝術的成功上、學藝術的人可以得到一種很好的敎訓、就是要藝術丨丨無論是彫刻或是繪畫丨成功、非致力於素描不可、因爲素描是藝術的基礎、没有良好堅固的基礎、斷難望藝術之成功、</p>
<p>伯氏的作品可以分爲兩大類、一類是浮彫（Ｒeliefe）、一類是彫像（Ｓtatues）、</p>
<p>他的浮彫是裝飾性的理想主義的作品、颇有古希臘彫刻之風致、</p>
<p>他的彫像却與他的浮彫不同、乃是自然主義的作品、他的自然主義是澈底的、我們在無論那一個過去的或現存的彫刻家的作品中、都看不到像伯氏那樣澈底的自然主義的作風、他的自然主義的作品完全是創造的、並無絲毫取之於人、他的浮彫、則如前段所說、是多少受希臘彫刻之影響的、</p>
<p>伯氏彫刻注重造形、（Ｐicasso）此與台畢窩之注重性格表現與梅瑤爾之注重肉體表現都不同、性格表現與肉體表現爲從前的藝術家所已加注意者、至於造形問題、則至的空始爲人所注意（如現代畫壇領袖辟卡梭Ｐicasso之繪畫亦注重造形）、所以伯氏是一個極端近代化（Ｕltramodern）的藝術家、</p>

<p>本來在徐家匯乙大學和宣科讀書、受着多數人們傾倒的她、爲了不喜歡乙大學的機械式的課程、已轉到滬西的大學去了、這個消息、在滬西大學的男同學們聽到、那當然是很歡迎的、</p>
<p>她是一個鵝蛋的臉、披着黑蛇似的髮、她的嗜好是吃Ｃbocolate吃咖啡、吃牛乳、除了愛吃之外、她喜歡打網球、打籃球、至於性情呢、那當然是活潑、玲瓏的、</p>
<p>自從她進了滬西大學之後、她覺得内心上感到一種愉快、她更是發展她的活潑的天才、她除了敷衍地上了一些課之外、她便在操塲打籃球、網球、</p>
<p>人類的個性大都是隨着環境而轉移的、她現在是更活潑了、爲了她的活潑的特點、許多男同學是除了傾倒之外、很想追求她的、</p>
<p>○　○　○</p>
<p>一天、是一個秋天搖動的時候、她隨着學校的鈴聲踏到敎室裏去、</p>
<p>她緩緩地向前走着、她無意識地、在敎室前、踏上姓張的運動員的足、這個舉動、在她的實是無意識的、可是、這個舉動的流露引起全堂的學生笑起來、喧嘩起來、</p>
<p>「眞是一個無意識的女性啊、太浪漫了、」</p>
<p>「那的確的、我想她是被大學當局開除的、」</p>
<p>「至少是這樣、你看她這不規則的態度就可知道、」</p>
<p>「她除了打球、吃牛乳之外、像是没有什麽事情可以做的樣子、」</p>
<p>「那是無聊的女性啊、」</p>
<p>全堂的男學生是這樣的嘲笑着她、他們對於這一類的嘲笑感到異常的趣味、假如「人生的意義」是建築在趣味上的、那未、這個趣味性的嘲笑、便是他們理想中的「人生的意義、」</p>
<p>她對於他們這樣的態度是十二分討厭的、她認爲這種舉動是殘忍的、她對於學校生活起了倦意、同時、在書本上、她也想不到絲毫的趣味的、</p>
<p>她便哭也似的走到校長室裏去、她說着她爲了特别的家庭的環境關係、要求退學、</p>
<p>校長對於她的意見也並不反對、因爲他想子女的求學是需要同意家庭的意見的、</p>
<p>○　○　○</p>
<p>在乙大學不及一月的她、現在又自動的退學了、</p>
<p>乙大學的男學生在懺悔他們自巳的舉動、</p>

<p>Plans to Appoint Pu Wei as Chairman</p>
<p>(Beiping) Foreign sources report: Japan is increasingly active in organizing a government for Manchuria and Mongolia. Because Yuan Jin-kai is being passive, Pu Wei is seizing the opportunity to maneuver. Honjo has already agreed to appoint Pu Wei as chairman of the Manchurian independence government. (Special dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Jinzhou telegram: Recently, the Japanese side has been conducting extraordinarily intense preparations for the organization of a Manchurian independence government. Honjo and the Second Garrison Commander, etc., are separately running around, trying to win over various reactionary elements. (Special dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese authorities in Shenyang have recently forced Yuan Jin-kai to expand the scope of the Local Maintenance Committee to be similar in function to the former Northeastern Political Affairs Committee, forming a prototype for an independent government to achieve its conspiracy of dividing the Northeast. Yuan, seeing that his influence cannot reach beyond the areas occupied by the Japanese army, is showing considerable reluctance. Honjo has ordered Yuan to resign. Yuan has already drafted a declaration to be issued immediately. The Japanese side has obtained Prince Gong's consent to succeed Yuan as chairman of the Local Maintenance Committee. A restoration government may soon be realized. (Special dispatch, 29th)</p>

<p>Disrupting Joint Operations of Beining Railway and Other Lines</p>
<p>(Beiping) Reports from retreating Liaoning: The Japanese army is forcefully attempting to seize control of the northeastern railways. Besides having already disrupted the joint operations of Beining Railway and the "Four Eastern Railways" of Shenhai, Jihai, and Jidun, they are sending personnel to take over the Shenhai, Jihai, and Jidun Railways, changing them into branch lines of the South Manchurian Railway, and using Japanese tickets. The regulations are all determined by the Japanese side. They are now also completely blockading all stations between Zhengjiatun and Tongliao on the Siping-Taonan Railway. Employees of the railway bureau are being forced to move elsewhere. The Japanese intend to completely destroy the equipment at all stations to prevent joint operations between the Beining Railway and the "Four Western Railways" of Siping-Taonan, Taonan-Ang'angxi, and Qiqihar-Ang'angxi. The Japanese will seal off the tracks from Zhengjiatun to Tongliao. Henceforth, transportation on the Qiqihar-Ang'angxi, Taonan-Ang'angxi, and Siping-Taonan Railways to Zhengjiatun will have to travel east to Sipingjie and then transfer onto the South Manchurian Railway. Therefore, the joint operations of the "Four Western Railways" are being invisibly disrupted again. It is reported that if the Japanese plan is fully completed, everything will be managed by their newly organized Transportation Committee. (Special dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Honjo, commander of the Japanese Kwantung Army, ordered Ding Jianxiu, a member of the Maintenance Committee, to form the Northeastern Transportation Committee to manage the northeastern Siping-Taonan, Taonan-Ang'angxi, Jihai, Jidun, and Shenhai Railways. Ding is serving as chairman, and Jin BIdong as vice-chairman. It was established on the 27th and is temporarily located inside the Shenhai Railway Bureau. On the 27th, oaths and declarations were issued, stating that it is the highest authority for the northeastern railways, supervising administration, etc. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) After reorganizing the Jihai, Shenhai, Siping-Taonan, and Jidun Railways, the Japanese side designated the South Manchurian Railway as the main line, dispatched four directors to Shenyang to manage affairs, and plans to move the South Manchurian Railway's general affairs office to Shenyang.

<p>Zhang Haipeng Plans Counterattack</p>
<p>(Beiping) Harbin telegram: (1) The Heilongjiang troops have a tight deployment along the Nen River banks. Zhang Haipeng is planning a counterattack, but it will be difficult to cross the Nen River. Wu Songlin is currently the commander, and Ma Zhanshan has gone to the front.

These Japanese were extremely rude, claiming that Zhang Haipeng and others must go to the province, Jiangqiao urgently needs to be repaired, and that Honjo will definitely implement the restriction on the appointment of military and political chiefs in the three northeastern provinces, and that Chairman Ma was appointed by Deputy Zhang, and will definitely not be allowed to remain in Heilongjiang for long, etc. It is reported that the Heilongjiang provincial authorities are having earnest negotiations with the Japanese consul, requesting that these Japanese, whose origin is unclear and whose actions are erratic, be strictly restrained.

<p>Japan's Recent Atrocities</p>
<p>Violate International Obligations</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the actions of the Japanese army in the three eastern provinces, the Japanese are extensively propagating in various countries as if the Japanese army's invasion is justified. Recently, Motoyama Hikoichi, president of the Osaka Asahi Shimbun, again made a declaration to the United States regarding Japan's position on the Manchurian incident, saying that Japan defeated Russia in order to maintain the open-door policy in Manchuria, and accused China of violating treaties by building parallel railway lines in southern Manchuria and inciting anti-Japanese movements to boycott Japanese goods. At the same time, it claimed that this is a local incident that cannot bear interference from other countries, that the current military actions are purely for defense purposes and do not violate the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and that the friendship between Japan and the United States is traditionally close and should be trusted by the United States. After the above declaration was published in American newspapers, Mr. Hotei, president of the United States News Agency, immediately sought the opinion of Gu Shaochuan. Gu published the following opinions on the 29th, the gist of which is as follows: "In the past, China was deeply grateful that Japan resisted Russia in 1904 for Russia's position in southern Manchuria. However, what completely disappointed China was that after the end of the war, Japan actually forced us to recognize the transfer of the leasehold of the South Manchurian Railway and other rights from Russia to Japan, and demanded new rights from China. It can be seen that the Russo-Japanese War of 1904 and 1905 was actually fought to seize territory. As for accusing our country of colluding with Russia against Japan, it is an unfounded claim, because China proposed to participate in the war against Russia at that time, but was rejected by Japan. The real reason is now clear to the world. Moreover, Japan closed the door to Manchuria after the end of the war, which aroused the suspicion of the United States, causing it to propose the neutralization plan for the Manchurian Railway, which ultimately failed because both Japan and Russia opposed it. Furthermore, Japan issued its world-renowned Twenty-One Demands in 1915, which is solid proof of closing the door to Manchuria. Later, when negotiating the new consortium issue, Japan again proposed excluding Manchuria, and it took some difficulties to get this proposal cancelled. However, the railways that Japan agreed to have jointly operated by the consortium were only the two that had already been designed. Regarding the case of building parallel lines to the South Manchurian Railway, which is regarded as China's breach of contract, China has not assumed this kind of treaty obligation. As for the alleged secret record in the minutes of the meeting stating that there is such a record, since it has not been signed by both parties, its validity and basis cannot be determined. Moreover, the Chinese railways are all built 50 to 70 miles away from the South Manchurian Line, and their purpose is only to promote the economic development of Manchuria and promote the open-door policy to increase the interests of industry and commerce in various countries. The South Manchurian Line is a tool for Japan to carry out political and economic aggression in southern Manchuria, which is well known to the world. Secondly, observing the actions of the Japanese army in southern Manchuria, the so-called anti-Japanese movement and boycott of Japanese goods are actually a natural expression of the Chinese people's indignation. It is strange that the Chinese people have been able to barely restrain their expressions to this extent despite Japan's various provocations. As for the slander that Chinese troops attempted to destroy the South Manchurian Line, it has been thoroughly investigated by disinterested third parties and found to be completely unfounded. Even if there was road destruction, it has been proven to have been done by them to create a pretext to cover up Japan's military actions. Furthermore, although Japan's investment is huge, if all countries follow Japan's approach to protecting its interests, the danger of destroying world peace will be unimaginable. Although the Japanese side has taken various methods to protect the Japanese people, the Japanese have never encountered any danger, and even to this day, there is absolutely no news of it. Therefore, the claim that the Japanese army's actions are limited to self-defense is a distortion of facts. As for advocating that Manchuria should apply Japan's Monroe Doctrine, it is not only unreasonable, but also extremely surprising, because the American Monroe Doctrine is a doctrine used to safeguard the political independence and territorial integrity of the countries in Central and South America, and Japan's actions in Manchuria are completely contrary to the spirit and intention of this doctrine. As for regarding the September 18th Incident as a local incident, it is tantamount to obliterating the thoughts expressed by all civilized countries in the world after careful consideration, and misunderstanding the efforts of the United States and the League of Nations to prevent the ambitions of Japanese militarism and maintain world peace. Moreover, the League of Nations has expressed its unanimous will for the sake of international peace and goodwill, and this will is fully supported by the United States. If Japan ignores this will, it is tantamount to deliberately treating the Kellogg-Briand Pact, the League of Nations Covenant, and the Nine-Power Treaty as waste paper. If it is said that today's new Japan wants to insist on violating world public opinion, this is what I dare not believe. In short, Japan's recent atrocities have completely destroyed all the international obligations it has assumed in peacetime for maintaining peace. Although the recent declaration by Mr. Motoyama Hikoichi seems reasonable, it is not enough to restore the world's trust in Japan. If Japan wants to restore the world's trust, it must not be in empty words, but in taking practical actions." (Special dispatch, 29th)</p>

(2) The Japanese army in Jilin has ordered our merchants and civilians to hand in all self-defense firearms by the 20th of this month, or face military law. (3) The four garrison commands in Jilin have been abolished and replaced by two Japanese garrison commanders who are responsible for maintaining local security.

(5) Japanese military officers in Jilin province have designated the former military factory in the eastern commercial district and the former barracks in Nandaling, Changchun, as residences for Koreans, calling them Korean reception centers. Jilin has gathered more than 3,000 people, and Changchun has gathered 5,000, all of whom have weapons. (6) The Japanese army uses inspections as an excuse to commit rape and robbery, doing everything. (7) Xi Qia is colluding with the Japanese to oppress the local army, so there are many mutinies. (8) The Japanese inspect the post offices in Jilin and Changchun, and all newspapers from Beiping and Tianjin are detained.

<h3 id="e14">League of Nations Resolutions Have Legal Effect <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to a certain legal scholar, the resolution on the Sino-Japanese incident passed by the Council of the League of Nations on the 24th of this month has been widely reported as having only moral value and no legal effect because Japan opposed it, and because Article 5 of the League of Nations Covenant stipulates that resolutions of the Council must be agreed to by all member states present to be effective. This argument is nothing more than a one-sided statement by the Japanese side and needs to be corrected. Article 5, paragraph 1 of the League of Nations Covenant stipulates, "Except where otherwise expressly provided in this Covenant or by the terms of this Treaty, decisions at any meeting of the Assembly or of the Council shall require the agreement of all the Members of the League represented at the meeting." According to this provision, the so-called unanimous agreement is a necessary condition for issues other than those "expressly provided elsewhere in this Covenant." The resolution on the Sino-Japanese issue this time falls within the exceptions mentioned in Article 5. Article 15, regarding the settlement of international disputes, states in paragraph 4, "If the dispute is not so settled, the Council either unanimously or by a majority vote shall make and publish a report containing a statement of the facts of the dispute and the recommendations which are deemed just and proper by the Council." Paragraph 6 states, "If a report by the Council is unanimously agreed to by the members thereof other than the representatives of one or more of the parties to the dispute, the Members of the League agree that they will not go to war with any party to the dispute which complies with the recommendations of the report." It can be seen that when the Council is unable to resolve any international dispute, it can pass a report stating the facts of the dispute and the Council's recommendations with the consent of a majority. Once this report is unanimously passed by the members of the Council other than the countries in dispute, the member states shall not engage in war against any country that complies with the Council's recommendations. The resolution passed by the Council this time is in accordance with the provisions of Article 15, paragraph 4, and is excluded by Article 5. Although there is one vote against it from Japan, the legal effect of the resolution cannot be reduced in the slightest. The world is widely spreading the idea that the resolution only has moral value, but little do they know that the resolution actually has legal effect when interpreted according to the League of Nations Covenant.

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e18">Remarks by US Senator Johnson <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>On the 27th, US Senator Johnson delivered a speech at the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce. He strongly condemned the Japanese army's forceful occupation of our "Northeast," stating that it was by no means a formal war, but purely an invasion of a neighboring country's territory taking advantage of its military weakness. He also echoed the famous saying, "Treaties are but scraps of paper during the European war." The current situation in the "Northeast" serves as a prime example of this. Therefore, he particularly criticized those who rely on treaties that are no more than empty words. While Johnson's remarks may allow for discussion on the principle of upholding global peace, they are indeed a revealing of the truth regarding the current situation, hitting the nail on the head.</p>
<p>Since the European war, the world's politicians and diplomats have devoted themselves to the peace movement, showing relentless dedication. Since the Treaty of Versailles, the so-called Hague Conferences, Security Conferences, Disarmament Conferences, Washington Conference, League of Nations, Nine-Power Treaty, and Kellogg-Briand Pact have exhausted the dictionary for words that could express sincerity in maintaining peace. These words were strung together into articles, with solemn vows, as if the world could henceforth obtain definite guarantees through these idolized "conventions," "alliances," or "resolutions." However, this illusion of peace and the worthlessness of these alliances, the emptiness of peace organizations, and the impassioned speeches and fervent gatherings of the world's politicians and diplomats, which are akin to performing farcical comedies and playing with kaleidoscopes, have all been thoroughly exposed by Japan's resolute disregard for everything in its current actions in our Northeast. Johnson further elaborated and commented on this fact. World politicians and diplomats might consider Johnson's speech an excessive argument, but the reality before us is indeed as such. Johnson merely dared to speak it out.</p>
<p>The atrocities inflicted by the Japanese army on our Northeast, from September 18th to the present day, have lasted for one and a half months. Despite the League of Nations' two resolutions and the formal issuance of a memorandum by the Entente powers, the Japanese have brazenly disregarded them. The Japanese army remains entrenched in our Northeast as before, and its atrocities continue to develop. According to a telegram from the 28th, the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Drummond, took the opportunity during the Japanese ambassador to Belgium's stay in Geneva to urge Japan to withdraw its troops, but the Japanese government ignored him. Furthermore, on the 27th, the Japanese Ministry of the Army discussed the issue of stationing troops in the Eastern Provinces and decided to withdraw the existing troops stationed there, but at the same time decided to dispatch forces to replace them and still intends to increase troop strength. It is conceivable that there is no sincerity in withdrawing troops. The provisions in the alliance are such, while the actual manifestations are otherwise. And the international allies, faced with this blatant betrayal of the alliance, trampling of justice, and disruption of peace, merely offer futile advice, perfunctory resolutions, and wasteful debates, unwilling to impose just and effective sanctions in accordance with the provisions of the alliance. Is this not, in fact, clearly demonstrating that treaties are mere scraps of paper?</p>
<p>Our fellow countrymen, listen carefully to Johnson's words. Relying on treaties that are no more than empty words is no different from relying on an iceberg. If we do not seek self-help but beg for salvation from idolized alliances, it is not only incompetent but also shameless. Balfour once said, "China should assess the changes in the world and seek its own reforms." Sun Yat-sen also said, "All matters should be decided by China itself. Foreign countries cannot assist China." Only self-help can lead to self-salvation. Only self-help can win the sympathy of other countries. May our government and our people deeply reflect and awaken in this time of peril.</p>

With the exception of the Japanese representative, the Administrative Council has unanimously agreed, and our representative, Shi Zhaoji, has accepted it. He supported the provisions in Article 4, Item B of the resolution, regarding the acceptance of the territory from which Japanese troops have withdrawn, guaranteeing the safety of the lives and property of Japanese residents, and the provisions of Article 5, regarding the appointment of representatives to negotiate details, are all obligations accepted by our country. The government values the intentions of the League of Nations, is now actively preparing, and is proceeding in different directions, determined to fulfill all obligations before the Administrative Council meeting on November 16. The central government believes that the local authorities must fully understand the intentions of the government in order to be appropriate, fearing that there may be delays in telegram exchanges. Therefore, I was invited to Beijing to discuss a proper and rapid method, so that obligations can be fulfilled on schedule and the intentions of the League of Nations can be implemented. It is expected that the Japanese side will ultimately respect the unified intention expressed by the League of Nations and implement it, so that the efforts of the League of Nations and the United States to maintain peace and uphold justice will not ultimately come to naught."

<h3 id="e25">Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Expresses Determination Not to Easily Abandon Responsibility <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>A Central Committee Member Discusses the Fourth Plenary Session</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to the Central News Agency, the account of the consultation process released in Shanghai differs significantly from the facts and obscures the true meaning of the original correspondence. General observation in Nanjing suggests that the Guangdong side seems to be using a news strategy and has not yet shown sincerity, which is causing considerable concern. It is said that Chiang Kai-shek is still strongly advocating for seeking compromises and has stated that he will accept the public opinion of the Central Government. With the national crisis at hand, he would rather endure everything than allow disruptions in unity and will never lightly abandon his responsibility. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A reporter visited a Central Committee member on the 28th to inquire about the recent consultations on peace and unity and to ask for their views on the matter. The Central Committee member made the following remarks: "The telegram to step down was originally agreed upon based on the original proposal telegraphed from Hong Kong, with the Guangdong government to be abolished after the agreement was reached. Upon arriving in Shanghai, this was also changed to after the agreement was reached. As such, the Guangdong side may have had its own difficulties in changing the original agreement, and the Central Government may be able to understand this due to the spirit of friendly cooperation this time. However, as long as the Guangdong side definitely abides by the agreement in Shanghai in the future, the original agreement that the Central Government has consistently allowed will of course not be changed. However, the matter of the telegrams to step down all occurred after the agreement, so why bring it up as the very first thing to be discussed, wasting words and causing misunderstandings? When the Guangdong side arrived in Shanghai, they demanded that the Fourth National Congress be decided by the Central Committee members of the First, Second, and Third Congresses. If this is the case, then the so-called collective deliberation that is currently needed is only to decide whether the Fourth National Congress needs the Central Committee members of the First, Second, and Third Congresses to decide. This shows that resolving all national affairs cannot be decided by the current eleven representatives, nor can it be decided when the Central Committee members of the First, Second, and Third Congresses convene. It must be decided by the Fourth National Congress. This is to centralize power in the party, this is to respect the proper path of the party's highest organ. If this is the case, then the discussions of the current eleven representatives in Shanghai should focus on discussing whether the Central Committee members of the First, Second, and Third Congresses can convene to decide whether to hold the Fourth National Congress, as the first thing to be discussed. This is an extraordinary difficulty. Although all eleven representatives are important party members, there is nothing wrong with informally discussing whether the Central Committee members of the First, Second, and Third Congresses can convene to discuss holding the National Congress, with free and non-committal discussions in their individual capacities. However, even if the eleven representatives make this suggestion to the Central Committee members of the First, Second, and Third Congresses, the Central Committee members will be in a very difficult position, because the constitution does not provide for this, so they cannot rashly violate it. At the very least, such a method must wait for the Fourth National Congress to amend the constitution, adding that the National Congress can also be held if the Central Committee members of previous sessions convene to decide. Then, in the future, if there are such disputes, this method can be cited. Currently, the status of the Central Committee members cannot be arbitrarily used to disregard the constitution that all party members must abide by. Then there is a deadlock, so they cannot help but want to find a rescue plan. The responsibility lies with the Central Government, pushing the Central Government to automatically invoke the precedent of the First, Second, and Third Congresses, and then designate as many of the so-called Central Committee members of the First and Second Congresses as possible as representatives, then in reality the Fourth National Congress will have already included the Central Committee members of the First, Second, and Third Congresses (the Third Congress is not an issue). In this way, it is both legal and the Fourth National Congress can be convened on November 12, so that national affairs can be decided first. Fortunately, all eleven of the current discussants are within this group, and others who want to speak can also be within this group. With more people gathering, the discussion will be more appropriate. In this way, as long as the Central Executive Committee automatically proposes a motion to designate as many of the Central Committee members of the First and Second Congresses as possible as representatives of the Fourth National Congress within the possible range, then there is almost no need for empty talk at present, and they can just wait to sit in the National Congress and speak again. If someone still does not accept this method, then it will greatly affect cooperation. However, it is deeply hoped that the Central Government will strive for peace and always maintain a compromising attitude, hoping that it will ultimately lead to cooperation."

<p>Ministry of Industry Calls Together Coal Merchants to Discuss</p>
<p>(Nanjing) In order to address the coal shortage, the Ministry of Industry has scheduled a meeting for November 17th and 18th, inviting leaders of coal merchants from the Ministry of Communications and Railways and various regions to discuss measures such as adjusting finance and increasing production. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Railways, in response to the request from various coal production and sales groups in Shanghai that the railways reduce freight rates in order to develop domestic production and compete with Japanese coal, should maintain the mining industry and prevent leaks, and should find ways to promote the export of domestic coal and establish a fair special price, and study the reasons for the increased export costs of domestic coal and try its best to remedy them. As for the freight rates that the representatives of various mining merchants agreed to increase at the National Commercial Transportation Conference, they should still take into account the difficulties of the railway administration and not raise objections. It has been found that in recent months, due to the boycott of Japanese goods in various ports, the coal stored in the mines has been sold out, and there is a shortage of coal per catty in the market. According to economic principles, market prices will naturally increase. Various mining merchants should take advantage of this period of boycotting Japanese coal to promote and expand domestic industry and commerce as much as possible, and should quickly abandon private interests and take into account the overall social situation, quickly seek a solution, and cooperate with the railways.

<p>(Jinan) Han expressed that the central government's finances are difficult, and the Third Route Army has been in arrears of pay for several months. Since political expenses cannot be diverted for military expenses, nor can the people's burden be increased, he can only temporarily take over the national tax agencies in the province to barely maintain them. Only over 400,000 yuan is collected per month. Furthermore, the new Salt Transport Envoy Li Wuchen and the Chief of the Unified Tax Management Office Hou Xitian have now taken office. The salt tax will be collected by the Transport Office, and the anti-smuggling team will also be under the jurisdiction of the Transport Office. The repayment of foreign debts will still be handled by the Audit Office. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Zhang Shaotang, the Secretary-General of the Provincial Government, said that Han believes that the Salt Transport Envoy and the directors of the Tobacco, Alcohol, and Stamp Tax Bureaus have been vacant for a long time, leading to numerous malpractices. Therefore, he has temporarily appointed people to act as agents. The collected funds are still reported to the ministry according to regulations, but they are temporarily retained to be used for military salaries. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e62">British Labour Party Suffers a Crushing Defeat in the General Election <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Occupying only fifty seats in Parliament</p>
<p>The contrast with the previous session is stark</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 29th - Of the former cabinet members of the previous Labour government who resigned from the cabinet when Prime Minister MacDonald formed the National Government, a total of sixteen, with the exception of the Minister of Works Lansbury and the Attorney General Cripps, have now been defeated. Therefore, important figures of the Labour Party will disappear from this new parliament. The cabinet members of the National Government, with the exception of the Minister of Finance Snowden and the Minister of Justice Wauchope, who had already stated that they would not stand for election, were all elected. Although MacDonald was expelled by the Labour Party branch in the Seaham constituency, he was still elected with 28,978 votes against 23,027 votes. It is noted that the House of Commons, including the university constituencies, has a total of 615 seats. At the time of dissolution, the number of seats for each party was as follows: Conservative Party 263, Labour Party 268, Liberal Party 58, National Labour Party 13, Independents 13. Of the 608 seats that have been declared, only seven constituencies are left undeclared. Of these 608 seats, the Labour Party occupies only 50 seats, which is a stark contrast to the previous parliament. Almost a complete wipeout, and these 50 seats are only for non-important figures in the Labour Party. The government party can be said to have won a complete victory this time. Even the British people who read the newspapers this morning were shocked by the crushing defeat of the Labour Party. None of the existing Conservative Party members were defeated, which is truly an unprecedented record for any major political party in Britain. Apart from the 50 seats of the Labour Party and the three seats of the Independents, the remaining 555 seats all belong to the National Government Party.</p>

<p>Prime Minister MacDonald has now issued a statement, informing the whole country, stating that the government has obtained an unprecedented majority, which will surely make the world know that the British people, when the nation asks for assistance, always respond with one heart and one mind. He further asked the people of the country to not only trust him, but also to be patient. As the people of the country know the difficulties of his work, he also wishes to give them full evidence that the government will work sincerely and strive together to find the best way to overcome the current difficulties. To the politicians who have suffered tremendous defeats and who have helped him to victory with their loyalty and courage, he wishes to say that their victory does not mean that he will ignore the interests of the working class when carrying out his current work.</p>

<p>Chancellor of the Exchequer Snowden also issued a statement to the people of the country, saying that Britain's position in the world will be greatly strengthened by this election. The result of this election is the greatest proof of democracy. The majority supporting the National Government is not that of one party, but a victory for the nation. This result gives the government the power to speak for the nation, but not to achieve its goals for one party.</p>

<p>Conservative Party leader Baldwin also issued a statement, saying that the country has won a great victory, but it is a pressing announcement by the British people as a whole to support national cooperation in order to restore the happiness of the country. The impact on foreign public opinion cannot be underestimated. The great support obtained by the National Government will resonate throughout the world and reaffirm its confidence in Britain's stability and greatness. Democracy has now expressed itself in a very remarkable form. The patriotism of our people has now been revealed to the outside world. When voting, the people of the country have declared in a clear voice that the doctrine of party strife cannot stand against the general desire for national cooperation in times of national emergency. The nation's workforce now trusts the National Government. He will certainly not let their trust down.</p>

<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 29th - Although Japan hates Britain for not supporting Japan in Geneva, Japanese newspapers and party leaders have unanimously praised the results of the British election, believing that this result can show the stability of the British people's thinking and their determination to restore their position in the world. It also said that the result of the British election represents a change from social idealism to patriotic pragmatism, and Japan should bear this lesson in mind.</p>
<p>Jiji Press, Tokyo, 29th - In the British general election, the Conservative Party won a great victory. As a result, the lifting of the gold export ban, which the whole world is watching, seems to be proceeding with the old parity method. The exchange rate of the pound will therefore be stabilized, but on the other hand, there is the threat of raising tariffs, and if the scope of preferential tariffs is expanded, Japanese traders will be greatly affected.</p>

<p>Reuters, Riga, 29th - Moscow was shocked by the results of the British election. The Conservative Party's great victory has now caused anxiety about Anglo-Russian relations. A dispatch from Moscow said that officialdom refers to the British people's psychology as unpredictable and believes that previous claims of unrest in Britain cannot be relied upon.</p>
<h3 id="e70">German Public Opinion is a Mixture of Worry and Joy <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>National Press, Berlin, 29th - In the British election, the government party won a great victory. German public opinion has mixed feelings about this. What is pleasing is that since a stable government has been established in Britain, the country and abroad will benefit from it. What is worrying is that after the establishment of the Conservative government, it will inevitably adopt an active tariff policy. In today's free trade Britain, Britain is the main market for German products. If protective tariffs are implemented, German industry and commerce will inevitably be greatly affected. The above feelings are commonly expressed by ordinary German newspapers. However, the right-wing newspapers generally think from a political point of view, so they unanimously express joy at the victory of the British government party. For example, the Local Indicator newspaper even claimed that the British Labour Party was the source of all kinds of difficulties in Britain today and has been defeated by the public outrage of the people. Like chaff in the wind, it will be blown away in an instant. The newspaper also praised the British political system for being superior to others. Such a sound and noble election system is really second to none in the world. Other conservative newspapers also expressed unlimited joy at the British election and praised the soundness of the British people's political thinking. However, liberal newspapers, in addition to recognizing the correct actions of the British people in the British election, also suspected that this change was not enough to save the world's crisis and predicted that after several years of right-wing autocracy in Britain, the Labour Party would make a comeback. Furthermore, the protective tariff policy, which has become a fact, is even more likely to cause the Germans to be fearful. As for the socialist newspapers, they still try their best to encourage the Labour Party and do not recognize this election as an absolute failure.</p>

<p>National Press, Paris, 28th - Except for the newspapers of the Socialist Party and the Communist Party, the French newspapers still expressed great comfort at the victory of the Conservative Party in the British election. The Times said that this is a great sign of international order and national unity. MacDonald and Snowden did not hesitate to take the country as the most important thing in the national crisis, which can be said to be both intelligent and brave. The results of this election have further confirmed this. The Debate newspaper analyzed the results of the election, saying that many Liberal Party members who opposed the protective tax policy in the past and today also voted for the Conservative Party candidate for the sake of the country.</p>

<p>Jiji Press, Tokyo, 29th - The Kobe Maritime Cooperative Association held a joint labour-management meeting yesterday to discuss the current situation. Japanese shipping has been affected by Britain's suspension of the gold standard and the Manchurian Incident. Ships will reach 1.5 million tons. Remedial measures such as operating funds and subsidies for ocean navigation have not helped the shipping industry. At present, the only remedial measure is for labour and management to jointly rescue more than 10,000 unemployed sailors. The association will recommend representatives to the government.</p>

<p>Difficulties in Compiling the New Budget</p>
<p>Jiji Press, Tokyo, 29th - The Japanese Ministry of Finance announced the national treasury accounts as of the end of June, with revenue of 110,243,000 yuan and expenditures of 177,388,000 yuan. The tax revenue was 48,800,000 yuan, a decrease of 8,306,000 yuan compared with the same period last year. The reason for this is the poor economic situation, which has led to a reduction in income tax, liquor tax, customs duty, and business income tax. Stamp tax revenue decreased by 1,028,000 yuan compared with the same period last year. Revenue from state-owned property and miscellaneous income also decreased across the board. In terms of current affairs alone, there was a decrease of 10,237,000 yuan in three months of this year.</p>
<p>Jiji Press, Tokyo, 29th - Finance Minister Inoue visited the Army Minister this morning to explain in detail the financial difficulties of the country. Regarding the compilation of next year's budget, considerable consideration must be given. He asked the Army Minister to try his best to reduce the budget by another 10 million yuan. Afterwards, the Army Minister immediately convened the heads of the Ministry of the Army to discuss this issue, hoping to meet the wishes of the Finance Minister, but it seems that it will not be possible in the end.</p>

<p>National Press, Rome, 29th - Today is the ninth anniversary of the Italian Fascist Party's entry into the country. There are grand celebrations throughout Italy, and in Rome City, there is a grand military parade by Prime Minister Mussolini. The whole city is excited and joyful, and the torches are lit up at night, which is very grand for a while. Many places hold public works today, such as the completion ceremony of schools, bridges, and new railways, to commemorate the event. These public works number about 2,000 and cost 200 million lira (Italian currency). This is enough to increase the glory of Fascism. There is a largest new-style merchant ship in Trieste, weighing 48,000 tons, which will be launched today. The ship was built on the anniversary last year and will be completed next year. In the future, it can win glory for Italy on the Atlantic Ocean.</p>

<p>Welcoming Representatives Have Been Released</p>
<p>But Attached with Compromise Conditions</p>
<p>Harbin Communication, After Zhang Haipeng learned that the provincial army had mobilized to resist, he retreated and adopted a defensive posture. The two sides confronted each other across the river (because the Jiang Bridge has been blown up). Zhang's rebellious army took Tailai County as the first line of defense. However, its main force did not move out at that time. Only 1,500 people who were repairing river projects were temporarily formed into an army and used as a cavalry vanguard force, deployed on the front line. This action was very embarrassing, because Yuan's brigade of the Tunken Army stationed in Tachengzi (now reorganized into a division) has already revolted, controlling the back of Zhang's army, and there was also a collapse within Zhang's army. If there were no Japanese troops as reinforcements, Zhang's army would have been like a turtle in a jar, and it would not have been difficult to capture it in one fell swoop. Now Zhang himself is still stationed in Taonan and ordered his eldest son, Zhiming, to be stationed in Tailai. Zhendong County is also under its occupation, so Zhang still occupies the land of three counties. On the afternoon of the 21st, there was another contact between the two sides. After a fierce battle for three hours, with the Japanese army assisting in the battle and firing artillery, Zhang's soldiers were unable to support and retreated. At 11:00 a.m. on the 22nd, four Japanese planes flew to Daxing Station (about 16 miles from Angangxi) and dropped eight bombs, seven of which exploded. Fortunately, one large bomb landed on the sand and did not explode, so only one or two soldiers were injured. Chairman Ma Zhanshan has taken over today (22). The ceremony was very simple. After the ceremony, he held a military meeting. The overall principle was to fight, and there was a saying that the Jiang Bridge should be repaired immediately in order to attack. Today, Vice Commander Zhang forwarded Zhang Haipeng's telegram, intending to clarify his intentions and that he had no intention of seizing Jiang Province. However, it was said that he was surrounded by the Japanese army and could not bear the coercion, which also showed his lack of reason and words. However, the matter is obvious and cannot be saved.</p>
<p>Yang Xiangqiu (Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce) and other eight representatives of various legal entities who were recommended to go to Taonan to welcome Zhang Haipeng the day before, because the provincial authorities temporarily received an urgent telegram from Vice Commander Zhang, insisting on fighting, had to change their position and actively resist. Zhang was very angry when he heard the news on the way, and he almost wanted to vent his anger on the representatives and poison them. Later, after all kinds of explanations, it was said that the mission of the representatives was only to represent the meaning of the local people. The only purpose was to hope to maintain peace and avoid starting a war. As for the proposition of the Beiping side to change the local officials by order (at that time, except for Chief of Staff Xie and Deputy Adjutant Tang, other important figures had temporarily taken refuge), it was really impossible for the representative power to prevent it, etc. Only then did Zhang understand a little, but he was still angry, so he did not release the representatives back to the province for a while. It was not until the 20th that a trusted friend named Jiang Mingjiu, who was also over 60 years old, was sent in a private capacity to accompany the representatives back to the province, taking the road of Changchun Harbin. It was heard that he secretly carried the mission of mediation and compromise. Among these eight representatives, Wang Jingxiu (Provincial Government Counselor and Director of Education) was left as a hostage. It is not known what it is for. On the 22nd, the new Chairman Ma specially convened a meeting for this matter and decided to recommend Ma Zidan (member of the Provincial Government) and others to accompany him to Taonan to exchange opinions.

<h3 id="e80">News from the Harbin Press World: Reception for Foreign Journalists <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Reporting on the Situation of the Northeast Under Japanese Occupation</p>
<p>Speeches from Newspaper Reporters</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: In order to allow foreign newspaper reporters to understand the true situation of the Japanese military's atrocities, reporters from newspapers in Harbin held a reception for foreign newspaper reporters from Harbin at the Huae Hotel in Daoli on the afternoon of the 23rd. More than 20 reporters from various newspapers attended. Li Pei of the Guowen News Agency was elected chairman, with Liu Tianyou of the Guanghua News Agency and Liu Quansun of the International Association News Agency serving as English and Russian translators, respectively. The foreign reporters attending included Ivanov and Genasinoff of the Russian-language newspapers, Ms. Irene, a special correspondent from the Chicago Daily News of the United States and the Shanghai Millard's Review, Masugowan of the Harbin Daily News, Bereske of the Harbin Xinbao, Gao Fuman, Kalikin, and Yenov of the Russian-language Ruble Newspaper, Kuolopakce of the Russian-language Donghua Newspaper, Furet of the English-language Daguan Newspaper and the British Asian Agency, Milik of the Russian-language Public Newspaper, and Niechijin, a resident reporter from the Soviet Daily Newspaper in Harbin. After the meeting was opened, the chairman delivered a speech, saying, "We are very honored that you gentlemen have deigned to come today. To be frank, there are many people in Harbin, but there are only a few hundred Chinese and foreign colleagues in the industry. We had long planned to fulfill our duty as hosts, but we have been constrained by various matters and have delayed until now. We are truly sorry. Unexpectedly, international justice has recently been trampled on, and world peace is in imminent danger. However, we are still very pleased to gather with you gentlemen. Regarding the Japanese military's invasion and occupation of Liaoning and Jilin, Moscow newspapers have unanimously called out, 'The real struggle is still to come.' You gentlemen have lived in Harbin for a long time and have more accurate knowledge. You must have a deeper understanding of the situation in China. Moreover, today is already the ninth day since the Japanese military violated the League of Nations resolution of the 30th of last month, which required them to withdraw their troops by the deadline. We have specially prepared refreshments to report on the truth, not only for your use in future historical records, but also to clarify right and wrong and maintain justice, just like your general mobilization. We would be especially grateful if you could offer your guidance." After the report was finished, pre-prepared report documents were distributed. Sun Shaoxian, a reporter from the Public Newspaper, read them aloud once. Subsequently, Furet, a reporter from the English-language Daguan Newspaper, delivered a speech, saying, "Although I am not Russian, there are many Russians here, so I will give my speech in Russian. In addition to deeply appreciating your hospitality, what I want to say to you gentlemen is that I have been engaged in the news business for many years and have connections with major newspaper offices in various places. I had long planned to get close to Chinese newspaper reporters, but I did not have a suitable opportunity. Today, I have this opportunity to meet with you all. Although what I want to say cannot represent all the guests, I believe that expressing my opinion in my individual capacity will gain the sympathy of most people. We record news and focus on facts. You gentlemen can understand by reading the records of the Harbin correspondence in the English-language newspaper. Two weeks ago, there was a similar opportunity in Beiping, where Chinese and foreign newspaper reporters could gather together. At that time, one reporter said that it was very difficult to get news from China, but the Japanese side fully supplied materials. Today, I am very grateful for your reports. Although most of the things reported have already been reported and published, I still intend to select and publish the reports in correspondence to various newspapers in England for publication. In the past, foreign news telegrams were not obtained from China, so naturally there was not much benefit for the Chinese side. Therefore, I hope to be close to Chinese reporters often, so that I can obtain truthful news from the Chinese side and understand the opinions of the Chinese people, so that I can report to various newspapers in England." The reporter from the Ruble Newspaper delivered a speech, saying, "If newspaper reporters have a powerful union, its power will naturally be great. I originally had a plan to connect Chinese and foreign newspaper reporters in Harbin and organize a union, but I did not have a suitable opportunity. Today, I have this opportunity, which may be the basis for the success of this matter. In the future, it may be put into practice. This kind of organization has great benefits. It can exchange news, obtain accurate news, and hope to achieve the goal of freedom of speech, as well as other mutual benefits. A Russian proverb says, 'Silence means acquiescence.' However, because we are restricted, we cannot have full records. We foreigners are here as guests. Since we have received the hospitality of the host, if the host is unwilling to express opinions, then it will be very difficult for newspaper reporters to visit various agencies to inquire about news. Therefore, it is easiest for there to be inappropriate things in the published news. Recently, the Party Department invited foreign newspaper reporters to express the attitude of the Chinese people, which is very clear. They can be called comrades in distress with Russia, so Russians express great sympathy for your countrymen." The reporter from the Donghua Newspaper delivered a speech, saying, "Although I am a Russian reporter, I work for the Russian-language edition of a newspaper in China. Since the Japanese invasion and occupation of various parts of the Eastern Provinces occurred, we have expressed our opposition to this action by Japan and supported the rights of China. Although the Japanese military has full equipment and great self-confidence, I firmly believe that in the future, justice will surely prevail, so the final victory will ultimately belong to China." The Soviet newspaper reporter gave a speech saying, "As for what the Chairman said about the Moscow newspapers, I am afraid that the Soviet newspapers are not easily available locally, and if you want to know the attitude of the Soviet newspapers towards China, you can read the newspapers issued by the Soviet Union elsewhere, and you will understand, and the attitude of the Soviet Union towards China, or Chinese and foreign journalists all know, can be said to be expressing full sympathy and goodwill towards China, and the Russian and Russian newspapers in Harbin may not be able to truly support the rights of China, and at the same time, the enemy of China is also publishing Russian newspapers in Harbin," the United States Chicago Public Newspaper reporter gave a speech saying, "I represent our newspaper and the magazines we serve and express our hope that Chinese and foreign journalists will exchange materials with each other, so that they can have an accurate record, and I have the utmost trust in your report, and I hope that you will work hard to get out of the national difficulties." The reporters all gave speeches one after another, and the gathering dispersed after enjoying themselves. The main points of the report issued by the Chinese press on that day were divided into six points: (1) Japan's so-called "Manchurian and Mongolian disputes," (2) Japan's prior planning and preparation, (3) The course and present situation of Japan's invasion and occupation of the Northeast, (4) Japan's violation of international faith and destruction of international laws and treaties, (5) The objects of the Japanese military's invasion and occupation of Manchuria and the exposure of the second step of their conspiracy, (6) The attitude currently held by the Chinese government and the people. The full text is omitted due to its length. (23rd)</p>

<p>San Francisco Dispatch: Various groups and schools of overseas Chinese in the United States, due to the fact that the Japanese imperialists have invaded our country, occupied the Eastern Provinces, destroyed various city buildings, and massacred countless people, are deliberately violating international law and despising justice. Therefore, on September 27, they held an anti-Japanese propaganda conference at the Great China Theater to arouse the sympathy of overseas Chinese for anti-Japanese patriotism and to hold a parade. At 12:00 noon on that day, they gathered in front of the Kuomintang General Branch, lined up, and set off, going from Stockton Street to Sacramento Street, turning to Grant Avenue, and then to Jackson Street to the meeting venue. The parade used a white cloth banner with the words "Anti-Japanese Patriotic Propaganda Conference" written on it as the lead. Representatives of various groups and overseas Chinese all held slogans opposing the unreasonable aggression of the Japanese imperialists against Chinese territory and opposing Japan's extermination of humanity and massacre of compatriots. During the parade, the streets were crowded with onlookers. After arriving at the meeting venue, the meeting was held. Deng Yahun presided over the meeting. Those who spoke in succession included Huang Yunsu, Consul General in San Francisco, Huang Jintian, representative of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, Zhang Huiwen, representative of the Veterinary Student Association of Stanford University, Liao Junzhe, representative of the Sanyi Guild Hall, Zhao Fuqiao, representative of the Yanghe Guild Hall, and Wu Rui, representative of the San Francisco Branch of the Overseas Transportation Department of the Lianyi. Finally, the chairman read five proposals from representatives of various groups to the public and submitted them for voting. The entire venue passed the proposals. Then, they shouted the slogans "Down with Japanese Imperialism" and "Long Live the Republic of China" and dispersed the meeting. The five proposals passed were as follows: (1) Send a telegram to Representative Shi Zhaoji urging the League of Nations to uphold justice and sanction Japan for its unreasonable invasion of China. (2) Send a telegram to thank US President Hoover and ask him to continue to uphold justice and maintain peace in East Asia. (3) Send a telegram to the National Government, requesting that Japan withdraw its troops within 24 hours and return all occupied areas, compensate for losses, otherwise, please use force to expel the Japanese invaders from the country, and absolutely refuse to directly negotiate with Japan. (4) Send a telegram to the Shanghai Press Association to forward to various people's organizations throughout the country, asking them to work hard to prepare for military affairs and use force to expel the Japanese invaders from the country. Our overseas Chinese swear to be the backing. (5) Please invite Mr. Hu Zhantang to take charge of the overall plan and jointly resist foreign aggression. (September 28)</p>
<h3 id="e82">The Increase in Coal Transportation Prices on the Jiaoji Railway <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Qingdao Dispatch: The increase in coal transportation prices on the Jiaoji Railway has caused coal merchants along the line to rise up in opposition. The Shanghai National Coal Production and Sales Association also believes that it is not appropriate to increase prices during the promotion of national goods. Therefore, it recently sent a telegram to the Jiaoji Railway Bureau to inquire about the truth of the increase in coal transportation prices. The Bureau has telegraphed back to the Association regarding the circumstances of the case. The original telegram stated, "Regarding your telegram, the issue of coal transportation prices on this railway began in April of this year. We received an order from the Ministry stating that due to the soaring price of gold, expenditures on various railways have doubled. We were ordered to increase passenger and freight prices on various railways to make up for the losses. It was stipulated that passenger and freight prices on this railway would be increased by 20% across the board, and this was implemented on May 1. At that time, coal merchants raised objections to the coal transportation prices. Subsequently, Zhuang Shuting, representative of the Boshan Mining Industry Association, and Lu Da Company of the Qingdao Export Association, etc., sent a telegram on behalf of the company on April 4 and submitted a document on April 28. In addition, the Ministry of Railways sent a telegram on May 5, forwarding a document submitted by coal merchant representatives Cai Yiting, Ding Jingchen, Li Zumo, and Wang Shaoming, etc., all stating that the 20% increase in transportation prices should be complied with for domestic sales, but they requested exemption for exports. On May 30, Commissioner Ge of this railway was in Jinan. Coal merchants again selected Yang Yuan, manager of Lu Da Company, Ding Jingchen, manager of Yuesheng Company, and Zhuang Shuting, general manager of Tongxing Company, etc., as representatives to pay a visit, saying that coal merchants' business was light in the summer and requested that the export transportation prices be exempted from the increase during the summer. After the summer, an increase of 10% would be acceptable. Because there was a precedent for reducing coal transportation prices by 10% every summer on this railway, the proposed 20% increase was immediately used as a price reduction and submitted to the Ministry for approval. It was implemented on June 1. Subsequently, as the summer was coming to an end, the domestic sales transportation prices had already been approved by the merchants in previous documents and telegrams, so there was no problem. The export transportation prices were based on the coal merchants' statement that they could only increase by 10%. If they were required to increase by 20%, it would have an impact on foreign sales. Therefore, the export coal price was changed from 2 yuan and 5 jiao 2 fen to 2 yuan and 8 jiao, an increase of slightly more than 10%, which was in line with the amount stated by Yang, Ding, Zhuang, and others. After the proposed transportation prices for domestic and export coal after the summer were determined, they were submitted to the Ministry for approval and were ordered to be implemented after the end of the summer in late October. However, after the announcement, the coal merchants raised objections again. This is what this railway cannot understand. Your telegram stated that it is not appropriate to increase prices at the moment when national goods should be maintained. This case is a fact from May and did not happen now. We are honored to have been asked and have telegraphed back the circumstances for your reference." (October 27)</p>

<p>Discovery of a Large Gang of Bandit Ships Near Luyuan: At about 11:30 p.m. on the 28th, the armed agencies of this county received a telegram from Jiangyin, stating that a large gang of bandit ships had been discovered on the river surface near the Bayi Port, which is located at the junction of Yu and Cheng and close to Luyuan in this county. Among them were shallow-water gunboats and dozens of civilian ships, totaling nearly a thousand people, equipped with various firearms, such as machine guns. After receiving the news, this county immediately had Yang Qingjiu, captain of the 13th Water Police Team, telegraph the Yu Patrol Ship stationed in Hupu Port Town to be on alert.

<p>The Situation of the Assaulting Police and Resisting Arrest Case Is Expanding: Xia Chunde, Director of the 16th Branch of the Public Security Bureau, sent nine people, including doctors Sun Deshun and Meng Qingfa, to the Zhu A Da teahouse in Yangting Town, 8th District, on the 12th of this month to arrest gamblers. Unexpectedly, Gao Yiqing and Deng Zuobi, the deputy township heads of the town, dared to instigate the gamblers to beat the police officers, causing injuries. Police officers Sun and Meng died due to their serious injuries. Subsequently, the County Court sent personnel to examine the bodies and confirmed the injuries. Coffins were prepared for burial, but the wives and brothers of the deceased, Meng Sun, and Meng Ying, believed that the district fee chief and the head of the branch office were largely responsible for this case. Therefore, they reported to the chairmen of the Yancheng Fellow Villagers Association, Jin Deyang and Liu Qidi, asking for assistance in seeking redress. Yesterday, Mr. Liu, together with the family members of the deceased, went to the Public Security Bureau to petition. Section Chief Hu came out to meet them on behalf of the bureau chief. Mr. Liu presented four points, asking for an immediate response: (1) The County Court has already confirmed that the deceased police officer Meng Qingfa died from injuries. Why did Branch Director Xia report that he died of typhoid fever? Was he injured or sick? (2) Taking a step back, even if it is acknowledged that Police Officer Meng was indeed ill, how could Branch Director Xia still order him to go out and arrest gamblers? (3) Such a large case of resisting arrest and assaulting the police is clearly a criminal offense. Why has the Public Security Bureau not transferred it to the court and only imposed a light punishment? (4) The most important thing in an assault case is to apprehend the murderers. The Public Security Bureau already knows the location of the murderers, so why has it not been able to apprehend them to this day? Section Chief Hu promised to forward the matter to Bureau Chief Hua to apprehend the murderers and seek redress.</p>
<p>Execution of Three Robbers: The County Public Security Bureau successively captured Gu Er'e, Xu Desheng (i.e., Xu Desheng), Hu Shijin, Zhang Xianda, and the ringleader Hua Yuquan (i.e., Ding Yuquan), five robbers who robbed Zhang Baoguan's home in Qingqiao Township, Jingyun City, and shot Zhang Liansheng. After presenting them to the County Government, County Magistrate Chen carefully studied the case. The robbers confessed to committing the robbery and sharing the loot. Based on the confessions, Chen believed that the three criminals Hua Yuquan, Gu Er'e, and Xu Desheng were more seriously involved and should be sentenced to death. Therefore, he telegraphed to the Department of Civil Affairs and forwarded it to the Provincial Government for review. After receiving the telegram, the Provincial Government believed that since the three criminals had confessed, they should be executed. County Magistrate Chen then ordered political police to bring the three criminals Hua Yuquan, Gu Er'e, and Xu Desheng from the detention center at 10:00 a.m. yesterday, verify their identities, bind them, and take them to the execution ground at the South School Field for execution as a warning.</p>

Now, according to a telegram from the Wujin County Party Department, Wu Wenbi died of his injuries at 4:00 a.m. yesterday. The Provincial Party Department deeply mourns Wu's sacrifice for the country. In addition to sending a telegram to Wu's family to express condolences and ordering the Wujin County Party Department to properly handle the aftermath, it also sent a telegram to the Provincial Government, strictly ordering the county magistrate to apprehend the murderers within a time limit and to remove and punish Li Zonggang, the Director of the Public Security Bureau of the county, to appease public anger.</p>
<p>Labor Dispute Occurs in the Weilun Factory: Since Yuan Yaomei withdrew as a shareholder, the Zhenjiang Weilun Silk Factory has received 22,000 yuan in maintenance funds from Shanghai under the name of Dingfengyong through the cocoon merchant Li Dongfu, preparing to start operations at a later date. Unexpectedly, a shareholder Zhang embezzled 18,000 yuan. Seeing that the funds were not available, Mr. Li dismissed the employees and entered into serious negotiations with Zhang. The general male and female workers, seeing Zhang embezzling the maintenance funds, went to Zhang's house to make a scene several times. Later, Mr. Li returned to Shanghai to recruit shareholders. After returning to Zhenjiang yesterday (28th) morning, the workers, believing that the recruitment was ineffective, went to Zhang's house again to question him and dragged Zhang to the Party and government agencies for negotiations. Later, a certain gentleman mediated the matter and promised to give a satisfactory reply today. Mr. Li also accused Zhang of embezzling huge sums of money, which led to the indefinite postponement of operations, and submitted a report to the various agencies for instructions, advocating for justice.</p>

<p>A total of five measures</p>
<p>It is reported that Mou Yu, a representative of the group of students returning from Japan, had a conversation with a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency. According to a certain staff member of the Ministry of Education, this record does not match the content of the conversation at that time. It is reported that three students returning from Japan, Cao Xiuxian, Mou Yu, and Tian Manyi (there was no Shi Wuwei), went to the Ministry of Education to petition, and a certain staff member of the Ministry of Education received them. The students presented various points, and they were answered separately. 1. Regarding the matter of sending all students studying in Japan back to China, the Chairman of the National Government issued an edict ordering the students to continue studying in Japan and not to return to China. The Ministry of Education has repeatedly ordered the Supervision Office for Students Studying in Japan to order the students to comply. (2) The Ministry of Education has a registration method for students who have returned to China. After registration, they will be sent to various universities to audit (not limited to national universities), and all expenses must be paid accordingly. (Students from free areas such as E, Xiang, Gan, Yu, Gan, Shaanxi, Wan, the north of Jiangsu, and the three eastern provinces can be handled according to the same regulations as domestic students.) (3) Whether provincial-funded students studying in Japan can transfer to other countries depends on the provincial governments. (4) The retention of student status in Japan for returning students must be determined after consultation with the Supervision Office for Students Studying in Japan. (5) The Ministry of Education previously ordered the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau to provide some food and accommodation subsidies to students who have registered and have special economic difficulties, but not more than one yuan per person per day, until five days after the school is assigned. In addition, requests for returning home expenses and anti-Japanese work maintenance fees were all answered that there was no such method.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the Ministry of Education has been handling registration at the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau since the 19th of this month. As of the 26th, more than 50 students have gone to register. The Ministry of Education has ordered various public and private universities to allow them to audit temporarily according to their subjects and levels. The registration method is scheduled to end on the 28th.</p>

<p>The Seventh District Education Association of this city previously decided at its fourth executive committee meeting to hold a general meeting of members at 2:00 PM this afternoon. Due to the large number of members, it was specially arranged to use the auditorium of the National Labor University as the venue. In addition to electing four representatives to attend the Municipal Education Association during the meeting, there will be many proposals submitted for discussion. The association is concerned that members may be preoccupied with educational affairs and may find it inconvenient to attend, so it has specially obtained approval from the Municipal Education Bureau to allow schools to suspend classes for half a day on that day.</p>

<p>The Chinese Vocational Education Society has been deeply indignant since the brutal invasion of Northeast China by the Japanese invaders. The colleagues in the office have organized an anti-Japanese national salvation society to strictly implement economic severance, agreeing not to use Japanese goods, and scheduled an oath-taking ceremony on the morning of November 2nd. The society also conducts practical research on the Northeast problem, sparing no effort. Today (Friday) at 4:00 PM, Zhang Songwen, a master from the Northeast People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Group, and other gentlemen will be invited to the society to lecture on the Northeast problem and the brutal invasion by the Japanese invaders, and to show slideshows, all of which are</p>
<p>Truth About Brutality: Zhang is a master's degree from the University of Lyon in France, a professor at Northeast University, and personally witnessed the events. His remarks should be even more valuable. In addition to the colleagues of the society, as well as the morning school, night school, general studies school, and comrades of the Advanced Mutual Aid Society, guests are also invited to attend the lecture.</p>

<p>Situation of Establishing a Book Lending and Delivery Department</p>
<p>The commercial library has collected a large number of books, which have always been open to the public. In response to the needs of readers, books have been available for loan outside the library for reading since the year before last. Recently, considering those who do not have time to visit the library to borrow books, a book lending and delivery department has been added. After various sectors learned about this, hundreds of requests for the regulations were sent to the library every day. The 5,000 copies of the printed regulations are about to be exhausted. This method is most sympathetic and gratifying to those who do not have time to leave their jobs and those who have lost their studies. A guarantee is attached to the regulations. Anyone who requests them can fill them out and send them back. As long as they pay a monthly transportation fee of two dimes or one yuan every six months, regardless of distance, and keep a catalog of the library's books, they can check out and borrow books without having to travel back and forth, without any effort. Any book they want to read can be delivered, which is very convenient. The establishment of this department by the library is truly convenient for many readers.</p>

<p>Professor Zhu Tongjiu, a master of economics at National Jinan University, specializes in economics and has written books such as "Wage Theory," "Research Methods in Economics," and "Post-War Trends in Economics," which have long been circulated in academic circles. Currently, during his teaching breaks, Professor Zhu's new book, "Labor Economics," has been published by Liming Bookstore. The book is divided into twenty chapters, totaling more than 200,000 words. Its content emphasizes the economic background and changes in economic systems to explain the occurrence of labor movements. Secondly, it explains the changes in law, politics, and thought, and the labor movement, which are mutually causal. In other words, the changes in law, politics, and thought are affected by the labor movement, and the rise and fall of the labor movement are affected by law, politics, and thought. Thirdly, it describes in detail the internal organization of trade unions and the techniques of trade unions, and infers from local trade unions to national trade unions and world trade unions to clarify the trends of modern labor movements. Fourthly, it discusses the methods of resolving labor-management disputes, from which aspects to start, to provide government authorities with a reference for determining labor policies. Fifthly, it details the social trends in various countries and evaluates their merits and demerits. The entire book has a rigorous structure and fair arguments, and is considered a masterpiece in the field of economics in recent times. Therefore, Dr. Ma Yinchu commented that the book has the merit of clarifying the complex ideological trends in the country and has the effect of guiding young people's thinking on the right track.

<p>"Clutching Buddha's feet in a crisis." This is the biggest problem of our people. Usually, they are muddleheaded and only know how to get by. Only when disaster strikes do they become anxious. Take this incident in the Eastern Provinces as an example. The Japanese had been plotting and scheming for more than just a year or two. I ask, what preparations did our country or its people make on a daily basis? Although our country claims to have 2 million soldiers, Chinese soldiers only have the courage to fight internally. When foreign aggression comes, they embrace a policy of non-resistance. Therefore, the people of various places, driven by righteous indignation, have risen up to organize volunteer armies. However, how can this kind of "clutching Buddha's feet in a crisis" organization withstand the organized and trained Japanese invaders? Therefore, I hope that in the future, on the one hand, the government should raise soldiers to fight externally and no longer engage in internal strife. On the other hand, the people should no longer engage in the "clutching Buddha's feet in a crisis" effort. There must be a permanent and definite organization. Only in this way can we resist foreign aggression and reject the Japanese invaders.</p>

<p>In the autumn of the third year of the Republic of China, I took a sea voyage eastward for the first time. I said to myself: The sea vessel travels so fast, that's great. The textbook told me that this was powered by a steam engine, and I should go and see this steam engine. I went to the engine room to take a look for a while. I thought to myself, steam is water that has been boiled, so I have to go and see what is used to boil this water and how it is boiled. So I asked my way to the entrance of the firebox. When I took a look, several shirtless people were being roasted there like Tianjin ducks! Roasted with black oil all over their bodies! Their bodies, faces, and hands were as black as the coal they were burning! This was the impression I got from my first meeting with the stokers. It was like nitric acid engraved into my heart. I understood. The price of riding the long winds and breaking the ten thousand li of waves is the tears and blood of the stokers! And not just on the sea. The firebox is a hell on earth. If you go into a power plant, a machine factory, a flour mill, or a weaving factory, you will know that everything we eat, wear, and live in is permeated with the blood and tears of the workers! When eating a bowl of porridge, a bowl of noodles, wearing a piece of clothing, or lighting a lamp, we should think of how difficult it was to come by. If you don't have a chance to see it for yourself for a while, then please listen to me sing!</p>

<p>The furnace is red hot.</p>
<p>People and coal are very much alike!</p>
<p>Fat people go in and skinny people come out,</p>
<p>All going into the chimney.</p>

<h3 id="e109">The Past Records of Japan's Tribute and Invasion <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>The island barbarians in grass clothing were first seen in the Tribute of Yu. Since the Qin and Han dynasties, there have been few Japanese pirate troubles. This is because their customs love freshness and beauty, and their land is fertile and rich. The 573 counties all enjoy the surrounding sea. The rulers and ministers protect themselves and do not covet China. After Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty destroyed Korea, they came to our country to pay tribute. (Korea belonged to Yan during the Warring States period. The Qin Dynasty established an outer border in Liaodong. When the Han Dynasty rose, it was difficult to defend due to the distance, so they repaired Liaodong. Therefore, the border reached the Pae River, which is east of Pyongyang, Korea, now called the Taedong River.) In the second year of Jianwu during the reign of Emperor Guangwu of the Han Dynasty, the King of Nu of Wa (Japan) sent envoys to pay tribute. In the first year of Yongfu during the reign of Emperor An of the Han Dynasty, he also sent envoys to pay tribute. In the third year of Jingfu during the reign of Emperor Ming of the Wei Dynasty, he sent the Daifu (official) Nan Shumi to pay tribute again. During the reign of Emperor Wu of the Jin Dynasty, he also entered to pay tribute. In the second year of Yongfu during the reign of Emperor Wu of the Song Dynasty, the King of Wa, Zan, came to court in person. In the second year of Yuanjia during the reign of Emperor Wen, Zan came to pay tribute again, and he established his younger brother, Zhen. At that time, he sent envoys to our country. In the twentieth year of Yuanjia, Zhen's son, Ji, succeeded and came to pay tribute. When Ji died, his son Xing succeeded and entered to pay court in the sixth year of Daming during the reign of Emperor Xiaowu. When Xing died, his younger brother Wu succeeded. In the second year of Shengping during the reign of Emperor Shun, he still sent envoys to pay tribute and presented memorials. After that, the rituals of paying tribute were continuously recorded in history. Those who saw the culture and artifacts of the Middle Kingdom and came to China to study, their ships were also constantly coming and going. There were even those who stayed for more than ten years before returning home. During the Sui and Tang dynasties, scholars and monks came to our country, with as many as five hundred or more people. Japan's admiration for the superior country can be said to be very prosperous. Since then, the culture of our China has gradually been transmitted to the three islands, and all laws and regulations have also been adopted by their scholars. Alas, how much did our China benefit the small island barbarians at that time? If they distort the past historical records and pretend to be friendly while carrying out acts of aggression, it is enough to stop them.</p>
<p>Japan's invasion of our sea borders began in the seventh month of autumn in the twenty-ninth year of Jiajing during the Ming Dynasty. They invaded eastern Zhejiang in the third month of spring in the thirty-fifth year. Zhao Wenhua and Hu Zongxian supervised military affairs to suppress the Japanese pirates. In the fifth month of summer, Zhao Wenhua was sent again to inspect the troops. In the eleventh month of winter in the forty-second year, the Japanese pirates captured Xinghua Prefecture. General Yu Dayou and Deputy General Qi Jiguang defeated them. In the fifth month of summer in the twenty-second year of Wanli, the Japanese pirates invaded Korea again. In the eleventh month of winter in the twenty-sixth year, the Japanese pirates began to flee. Our army pursued them in separate routes, and Korea was pacified. From Jiajing to Wanli in the fifty years, the Japanese repeatedly invaded us. At that time, Yan Song, a national traitor, held power and delayed military affairs to the point of decline, allowing the small pirates to be arrogant and domineering. However, he was still able to order generals and soldiers to eliminate the unrestrained ones and prevent them from invading again. He was also able to pacify Korea, to pacify the vassal states and appease foreign countries. It can also be seen that the sound and prestige of our China's punitive expeditions could still shake the universe. In the battle of the thirty-fifth year of Jiajing, more than 6,000 Japanese pirates fought for thousands of miles, lasting more than eighty days, and were finally annihilated by Cao Bangfu, the patrolling censor of Yingtian. Shen Liangcai succeeded him and reported the victory. Although later the jealous ones were greedy for merit and weakened their momentum, causing the Japanese pirate atmosphere to flourish again, the critics regretted it. However, our country put on armor and carried weapons in the vanguard, sacrificing their lives to kill the enemy on the battlefield, with more than 20,000 people. It can also glorify our national history and provide a spectacular sight for future historians. Alas, do those who now hold military power and control the military have any feelings about this? Although military matters are different now than in the past, and the relative strengths of China and foreign countries cannot be expressed through narrow-minded views, looking back at the past can also serve as a lesson.</p>

<p>A Factory Run Entirely by Women. In London, the capital of England, there is a factory that is entirely run by women, and men are not allowed to participate. This factory was jointly founded by twenty young women six years ago. They wanted to show the world some of their abilities and not think that this type of mechanical engineering business can only be done by men. The factory director is Ms. AAshberry, a member of the Engineering Society. There are only two female members in the society, and Ms. Ashberry is one of them. The craftsmen and even the clerks in the writing room are all women. Even the waiters who run errands and the salesmen who solicit business outside are all women. Since its opening, it has been extremely developed. Recently, it has signed contracts with the Aviation Department and the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company to supply them with supplies. This is very rare. Ms. Ashberry once told reporters, "We are very proud to have such a factory in the country that is completely run by women. Our employees are not satisfied with just working in the factory. Several people have entered night school to study drawing, mathematics, and mechanics because they also want to become members of the Engineering Society in the future. Most of our work is to manufacture the most detailed accessories for airplanes and radios. We are indeed proficient in this way."</p>
<h3 id="e111">Remembering Mr. Tang Wei's Teaching Spirit <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Keqin</p>
<p>At this time of national crisis, recalling Mr. Wei's earnest teachings, there is enough to revive the declining customs and save the mad tide. I will tell the world briefly. The teacher had gray hair and a bright spirit. He wore cloth clothes and ate simple meals. The distance between the residence and the lecture hall was about a mile. He walked to school. Even in the rain and snow, he never arrived late to school. How can he be compared with those who are still sleeping soundly when the sun is high? Before the bell rang, the teacher was already in his seat, lecturing and gesturing with all his strength. Whenever he read masculine texts, it was like a spring coming out of a high mountain, with wind and rain suddenly arriving. When reading feminine texts, it was like glory blowing in the wind, making people's hair stand on end. He encouraged people to set an example and said, "Scholars should be the first to worry about the world and the last to enjoy themselves." "Support yourself and do not ask for help from others." He encouraged people to go out and inquire about the world and said, "The people are my compatriots, and things are my companions." "Establish the heart for heaven and earth and establish a life for the people." He encouraged people to study and said, "Be diligent all day long." "Strive for self-improvement." He encouraged people to build their minds and said, "Sincerity never ceases." "The way of learning is to seek peace of mind." He encouraged people to save the country and said, "Sacrifice yourself for righteousness." "Give up life for righteousness." He especially emphasized integrity as the ultimate goal, so he selected the stories of Su Wu of the Han Dynasty and Zhang Xun of the Tang Dynasty who defended their integrity and died in hardship as a warning. How can they be compared with those who seek false fame in the world? The teacher said that the purpose of this school is different from the vulgar ones. Is this what he meant? I heard that the teacher is building school buildings and hiring learned people. If morality is lost and literature declines, there must be hope of revival. I am resting in Shanghai, witnessing the Japanese pirates' deceitful appearance. Remembering the teacher's merits cannot be erased. I will sharpen myself to learn from him.</p>

The loss of goods exceeded 200,000 yuan. (2) On February 28, three Japanese warships fired guns in Dafu Port, killing and wounding more than 30 fishermen. (3) In April, Japan sent troops to Shandong for the third time to help the Feng-Lu army in the war. The Northern Expedition of the Revolutionary Army was greatly affected. On the 21st, the Japanese army used the excuse of protecting overseas Chinese to deploy defenses in Jinan. On May 1, they began to massacre Chinese soldiers and civilians. On the 3rd, a conflict with the Japanese army occurred due to the posting of slogans, which led to a massacre. Thousands of Chinese soldiers and civilians were killed. Cai Gongshi, a negotiator from our country, was also brutally killed. Countless radio stations and houses were burned down.

<p>— Rui Hongchu</p>
<p>Amidst the sound of national crisis, we are not in the mood for entertainment. However, domestic films seem to be indispensable to promote. Recently, Tianyi Company created a domestic Movietone film, which was recently completed and released to the public at the New Grand Theater. I was invited by Mr. Tan Zhujun, the secretary of the company, to visit and watch. After watching it, I took up my pen and recorded it as follows.</p>
<p>The script of "Spring Scenery in the Singing Hall" was written by the famous novelist Yao Suifeng. Li Jinhui was also invited to specially compose the songs, which added to the splendor. Ms. Xuan Jinglin played the singer Li Huifang, gracefully appearing on stage and singing new songs of youthful joy. Her pearly voice was melodious and extraordinary, earning the audience's praise. Ms. Pu Jinghong played Huifang's maid Fanggu, and her singing was also clear and pleasant. Ms. Pu was burned by alcohol during filming and eventually died. Now the sound and image still exist, but the person is gone, making people sigh endlessly.</p>
<p>This year, our country's floods were extremely heavy, and many places became marshlands. The cries of the displaced were everywhere, which was unbearable to see. Therefore, the film interspersed with the Maritime Charity Groups holding a disaster relief performance. Mr. Zhu Ziqiao and Mr. Wang Xiaolai were specially invited to give speeches on the flood situation. Mr. Wang spoke in Shaoxing dialect, which made people laugh. Movie actresses were also hired. Ms. Xuan Jinglin sang "Jiangnan Hao" and "Picking Flowers." Ms. Yang Naimei sang "Cold Night Song." Ms. Xu Qinfang sang "Fragrant Grass Beauty Song." Ms. Wu Suxin sang "Su San Starts Her Journey." Ms. Zi Luolan performed the Zi Luolan Dance, and there were more than 20 male and female stars such as Chen Yumei, Lu Jianfen, Zhang Yongcui, Tao Yayun, Jiang Naifang, Qin Haha, Xiao Zhengzhong, Zhang Zhenduo, Chen Yitang, and Sun Min, which was quite lively. The clarity of the sound and the twists and turns of the plot were especially rare.</p>

<h3 id="e114">A Countryman Goes to Shanghai Again (1) <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>— Tian Xiao</p>
<p>Ever since the countryman stumbled upon Shanghai last time, he had been thinking about it all the time. He mentioned Shanghai while eating, he mentioned Shanghai while sleeping, and he mentioned Shanghai while defecating. "No wonder those yellow-haired girls are reluctant to return to the countryside once they get to Shanghai. Even I, an old man, have been thinking about it all the time after visiting Shanghai. I really don't want to be so old and have fallen in love. It's not any other kind of lovesickness, it's just the lovesickness of missing Shanghai." In his spare time, he held a foot-long dry tobacco pipe in his hand, a purple clay teapot, barefoot, and with his chest open, sitting on a bamboo couch in front of the door, and proudly said to the neighbors who were enjoying the cool breeze and had never been to Shanghai. "Old uncle! When are you going to Shanghai again?" Two seventeen- or eighteen-year-old village girls, named Ashui and Jin, raised their heads, and their sun-yellowed hair was reflected in the sunset shadow, looking at him enviously. "Me? I'll be going soon. Ashui and Jin! If you go to Shanghai, you'll never want to come back again. It's a pity that your father and mother won't let you go," the countryman said with a hint of seduction in his tone. "We don't want to go to Shanghai," Ashui's mother said firmly.</p>
<p>"Why not?" the countryman asked.</p>
<p>"Shanghai is not a good place. The year before last, the young daughter (Note 2) of our Lord's (Note 1) family went to Shanghai to be a maid because her aunt was helping people (Note 3) in Shanghai. Who knew that later, she went to a performance house and refused to come back. That young daughter had already been given to someone else, and the man's family wanted to marry her, but later she even had a lawsuit. Our Ashui has been promised to Xiao Mao, the son of Ada in the front village, since she was three years old. Shanghai is not a good place, we don't want to go."</p>
<p>"There are also people who make a fortune. Didn't that Xiao Ayi send money to her brother last year to build a house in the countryside?" This was an old man named Xiao Di, sitting near the awning, drinking shochu and enjoying himself.</p>
<p>"Hmph! Where did Xiao Ayi's money come from? Wasn't it earned by being a prostitute and selling her body? Shanghai is a filthy world, and even the cars are strange. What's called a turtle car, a tortoise tram?"</p>
<p>"Ashui's mother! You misheard. It's not a turtle car, it's a rickshaw. It's not a tortoise tram, it's a trolleybus," the countryman laughed loudly, indicating that he was an old Shanghai resident and had seen a lot.</p>
<p>(Note 1) The villagers call Sun Age Lord (Note 2) Young daughter means young girl (Note 3) Helping people means working as a servant</p>

<h3 id="e115">Financial Standard Gold Continues to Decline Slightly <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>No significant changes. Yesterday, the 29th, the price of standard gold tended to decline, but there were no special changes. It consistently fluctuated by only six liang, and ultimately fell slightly by two liang. Dealers' attitudes remained uncertain, so demand and supply differed significantly. As for the silver market, it rebounded, and there were rumors that the United States was planning to convene a silver conference. Therefore, it opened at a low price. Afterwards, buyers seemed to be more active, probably because the foreign exchange market stabilized slightly and banks made some purchases, so it turned upward. It rose from 703 liang to 708 liang. However, Japanese banks seemed to want to sell British gold, and because of the relentless selling in the market, a state of demand weakness was revealed. The market was still relatively stable, but trading was light and quite mediocre.</p>
<p>Opened down by more than two liang. It opened in the morning and fell by 2.9 qian, to 705 liang. The big bar rose by one-eighth. The official and private telegraph prices of silver each rose by one-quarter. Then it fell from 5.8 qian to 0.25 qian because Zhifeng, Yongfu, Changyuansheng, Dadecheng and others were selling. Later, HSBC bought 30,000 US dollars of forward US dollars at 125 yuan and 32.0625 yuan of recent US dollars. Moreover, because Daxing, Yongyuanmao, Yonggan, Changxiang, Zhifengyong, and others were buying, and because banks were mutually doing this month's British gold at 5.625, it immediately increased by more than three liang, to 0.57 qian. The announced price of British gold did not move, at 0.5 liang. Then it added three qian. Because scattered households came out, it fell by two liang, to 0.37 qian. After 9:30, Yuanxingyong, Daxingyong, Hengchangyong, Hengyu, Tong Taichang, and others all bought in, and the market sentiment suddenly strengthened and rose upward. By 10:00, it had risen to 0.85 liang, but the exchange rate was flat. Chinese banks sold recent US dollars at 32 yuan, and arbitrageurs came to sell, so the price gradually decreased. Forward British gold could be settled at 1.75. Until after 11:00, it dropped to 0.48 liang. In this small hour, there were advances and retreats of one or two liang. After entering, HSBC absorbed this month's British gold at 5.615, Shanghai and others absorbed forward at 1.75, and there were some scattered short sellers, which led to a pull-up of two liang. At 11:30, it was 6.8 qian. Because Hengyu, Xiexingyong, and others sold, and said that British gold seemed loose, with recent gold settling at 5.625 and forward gold at half a penny, people's hearts turned downward, and it fell by four liang, to 0.28 qian at noon. Tong Taichang slightly advanced. By the time the market closed at 3.7 qian, it was again pushed up to 0.5 liang. Goods and others bought in. Afterwards, it retreated to 0.4 liang again. The announced price was still 767.8 liang, with a discount of about 60 liang.</p>
<p>The afternoon market was desolate. The afternoon market opened at 0.45 liang. Afterwards, it was bought by Yuanmaoyong and others, rising by more than two liang, to 0.7 liang. Then it was suppressed by a little more than one liang. After 2:30, it was 0.53 qian. The foreign exchange market was stable. Banks made two-month British gold at half a penny, and November US dollars at 32 yuan, which was higher than at noon. Afterwards, British and Japanese banks made transactions with each other, with forward British gold at 4.375, so the price of gold rose by two points. At 3:15, it was 0.65 liang. But the trading on the table was extremely quiet, so the industry had already made a game and urged to hang up the closing sign. Therefore, by 3:30, it was counted as 0.58 qian. The closing price was 2.1 qian lower compared to the day before yesterday. But the crowd did not disperse and still extended until after 4:30. Suddenly, there were transactions between the Dalian gangs, and the price was raised to outside 0.6 liang. Jinheng sold more than 100 bars to Tong Taichang, with the price at 0.65 liang. Unexpectedly, that company suddenly claimed that it had exceeded the exchange's regulations and would not do business after 4:30. It was decided to abandon the discussion. However, Tong Taichang had advanced for customers, and the phone had already been dialed, so the field account should be stamped. Therefore, they went to the council to request a judgment and argued for a long time, which has not yet been resolved. The maximum price of the whole day was 0.85 liang, and the minimum price was 0.25 liang, with a difference of six liang. The early market for goods was six liang, the noon closing was 0.45 liang, and the afternoon closing was 0.5 liang and a half. The announced price was reduced by more than 60 liang. The registered price was 0.4 liang, the water supplement was 0.4 liang in the afternoon, and 0.6 liang, and the red bar was added by 8.5 liang.</p>
<p>A glimpse of the industry's transactions. According to the statistics of the transactions on the table, Yuanmaoyong, Tong Taichang, Fuyu, Hengyu, Yuankangxiang, Hengchangyong, Shunli, Yuanxingyong, Daxingyong, and Yu Da all entered. Zhifengyong, Qianchangxiang, Xiexingyong, Yuantai, and Yifengyong had quite a few withdrawals. Fuchang, Yuansheng, Futaiheng, and Cuichangyong all withdrew. Dadecheng had a total of more than 2,000 bars and advanced more than 100 bars. In the afternoon, Yuanmaoyong and Tong Taichang slightly advanced, while Wanxing, Fuchang, and Hengchangyong withdrew. It was heard that foreign merchants Qiao Zhifu slightly advanced. The Dalian gang advanced a total of 1,000 and withdrew 400 or 500, still occupying the short side. The Guangdong gang did not move, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e116">The Trends of Foreign Exchange Near and Far Differ <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the British, American, Indian, and silver markets all rebounded, and the exchange rate also rose. The HSBC hanging price only reduced the exchange rates of France and Germany by one yuan each. Hong Kong added 125 to 77.75 liang. The others, such as British and American, did not change. Probably the domestic market was loose at first and then firm, and then weakened again. As a result, it turned stable. However, the British exchange rate was 0.0625 higher than the previous noon. The recent market was loose and the forward market was tight. US dollars also increased by 125, with the recent market firm and the distant market broad, which was the opposite of British gold. It was inquired that Chinese merchants were shorting more than 4 million yuan, while British gold was only shorting tens of thousands of pounds. Yesterday, gold companies sold slightly, and there were also a few who entered. Banks doing mutual transactions were still not uncommon, with about 100,000 pounds of British gold and 200,000 to 300,000 US dollars transacted. The gold market slightly depreciated potentially.</p>
<p>British Exchange Rate. The domestic market had 0.125 fluctuations, with the loosest price at one shilling and seven pence and fifteen sixty-second of a penny, and the tightest price at 4.375. The morning offering price was 7.5 pence to 4.375, and the buying price was 5.625 to half a penny. Bank of China and HSBC mutually did October at 5.625.

<p>This term's long-term transactions have been quite quiet, mainly due to the unusually tight monetary conditions, which prevented arrangements from being made. Yesterday, monetary conditions eased, and a large number of loans were arranged by financial institutions. However, customer firms were selective, so not all transactions were transferred. Except for local and mainland firms, as well as old customers in various industries, most of whom transferred accounts, there were also new transactions. It is estimated that the total amount of loans released today was no less than five to six million (excluding transfers by old customers). The interest rates varied, ranging from 8 taels, 7 mace, and 5 candareens to 11 taels, 2 mace, and 5 candareens, divided into ten grades. Foreign firms also had fixed interest rates, mostly around 9 taels. As for the maturing loans in Hankou, there is no sign of them, so they are naturally not a concern, but there is no talk of new transactions.</p>

<h3 id="e121">Cotton Market Remains Firm <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>American cotton fell again, and the situation is very bleak. However, the local market sentiment is very firm, mainly because most people believe that the cotton harvest this year will be poor and the supply of Hankou cotton will be very scarce. Therefore, some people have a very strong intention to speculate, buying whenever there is a small dip. However, the price of foreign cotton remains low. Yong'an, Dasheng, and Shenxin purchased 20,000 bales, but with gold prices being flat and weak, the future of the cotton market is still difficult to be very optimistic.</p>
<p>Hankou-Marked Cotton Small Traders Cover Positions. At the opening of the Hankou-marked cotton exchange, due to the fall in foreign cotton, market sentiment was slightly soft, with declines ranging from 5 fen to 1.5 qian. In the afternoon, market sentiment was slightly firmer, and small traders covered their positions, rebounding by 5 fen to 1.5 qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 47,900 bales. It was found that Tongyu sold 2,600 dan, Shenchang 2,300 dan, Taixing 2,500 dan, and Changji 1,000 dan. Hengyi bought 1,700 dan, Changyu 1,100 dan, Changfeng 3,100 dan, Yi 2,300 dan, and Yuande 1,100 dan. The closing prices of Hankou-marked cotton are recorded below.</p>

<p>Nantou: Yesterday's supply was slightly less, and West New Non-glutinous was scarce. Nearly a thousand stones were moved in small quantities. The market price is expected to remain stable, and ordinary goods have risen slightly. Although Green Corner White Rice Kiln Seed and Maple Practice Hundred Brother Rice have arrived, the number is small. Transactions in this street's shops are still good, with the opening price falling by a few cents. Old broken rice remains at the original price. Du Yangjian has no significant changes, and Tongbian Yinhua has no goods available on the market.</p>
<p>Xinzha: Yesterday, 30 to 40 boats arrived from the countryside. The number of people in the market early in the morning was not very enthusiastic. West New and East New Non-glutinous were the most abundant, and the best goods rose by a few cents. Shibu Kiln Seed Wild Rice transactions were satisfactory. Rice sales were also good, leading to a price increase of 1.5 cents. Old broken rice and Pier Foreign Tip arrived and sold equally, with no significant increases or decreases. The arrival of new customer tip shipments was limited, and sales in this street were not weak, showing a soft trend.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Foreign Rice Spot and Futures Both Weak <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market was still active, but with the customer firms stopping operations and both spot and futures supplies being sufficient, market prices were weak by a few cents. Currently, only this street handled 500 bags of No. 1 Saigon rice, priced at $11.43. Futures prices fell back, and new transactions were active, with prices also falling. Jardine Matheson offered 500 tons of No. 1 Saigon for March delivery at 5 taels and 7 qian. Jebsen &amp; Co. offered 2,000 tons of Xiaojiao for March delivery at 5 taels, 2 qian, and 6 fen.

<h3 id="e125">Flour Market Surges Greatly in the Afternoon <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market saw prices hovering for most months after the opening of the market in the morning. Because foreign wheat quotations were very flat, people paid little attention. However, when the market opened in the afternoon, market sentiment suddenly surged. It was rumored that the government needed to purchase large quantities of military grain, making this month's situation the target of everyone's attention, forming a short squeeze. Although the number of chips in each line was not very large, factories, due to different circumstances, also made large-scale restocking. Furthermore, the sharp rise in wheat shook the minds of people in the industry, so transactions in each market rose step by step. This month even jumped five cents. Observing the subsequent steps, there are concerns about speculation and unrestrainedness, and there may be changes. As a result, this month rose by 4.75 cents compared to the previous day, November and December rose by 3 cents, and January, February, and March each rose by 3.25 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Near-Term Wheat Soars Out of Proportion <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the near-term wheat market saw prices in each month being very flat after the market opened in the morning, with foreign wheat quotations only slightly better by one jiao or a few fen. For a time, it was even a few cents lower than the previous day. However, when the market opened in the afternoon, market sentiment suddenly became tense, and people's minds were exceptionally agitated. Transactions were also unusually prosperous. The reason was that the foreign wheat ordered by the traders was all hedged, either for this month or for November. Now, most of it has arrived, and due to unusually tight monetary conditions, everyone wanted to sell early. After several rounds of sales, Fuxin finally purchased 14,000 tons of Australian Western wheat, initially at 3 taels, 8 qian, and 6.5 fen, and gradually increased the price to 3 taels, 9 qian, and 3.5 fen. In addition, the Tianjin group also purchased 4,000 tons of Russian wheat, priced at 3 taels, 7 qian, and 3 fen. The quantity was about 250,000 to 260,000 dan of spot goods. With the release of standards, it was inevitable to cover the sharp rise in the near-term market. The subsequent changes in market sentiment will not be difficult to find in this. As a result, November soared by 1 qian and 1 fen compared to the previous day (December rose by 8 fen, and January, February, and March each rose by 7 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Sugar Market and Official Market Both Turn Upward <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>

The current price of Java sugar remained unchanged. The official market trading was slightly more active, and market sentiment turned brighter. The transaction price of Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse sand white ranged from 11 taels to 0.05. The output was limited and scarce, and the market was quite brisk. Taikoo Sugar B mark was 11 taels, 7 qian, and 5 fen to 2 qian, DY fell 12 taels and 7 qian, and 5 fen, HX mark 11 taels and 9 qian and 5 fen. The output was very scarce, and the HM mark was 11.5 taels and 2.5 fen. Transactions were more active, and the market was very lively, with a high probability of rising.</p>

<p>The current price of wood ear mushrooms in the Gengshen Hankou market is in a state of upside down, so very few people in this industry have the opportunity to make a profit. Sichuan ear mushrooms also continue to arrive, which is quite burdensome. The current price of miscellaneous ear mushrooms in the Hankou market is around 75 taels, and the price of secondary ear mushrooms is 132 taels. Adding all external expenses, miscellaneous ear mushrooms still have to lose money, and secondary ear mushrooms are also difficult to make a profit. Yesterday, this market's business sold high secondary ear mushrooms for 150 taels, and miscellaneous ear mushrooms for 83 or 84 taels. Sales from all parties were flat, and the trend was weak and lifeless, without any good signs.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the local foreign firm silk market still had no turning point. Yesterday's European and American silk telegrams did not turn, and the market was sluggish. American firms, although hesitant about gray silk, continued to lower prices. Gray silk merchants, due to the prolonged market stagnation, painfully sold. Qianli purchased 140 bales of upper body yesterday, with prices down 20 taels. Boxing purchased 8 bales of shook silk, Jianxing purchased 15 bales of coarse yellow silk, and prices were flat and weak. Factory silk was not on the market.</p>

<p>The New York market has seen no improvement in Italian silk factory sales recently. In addition, with Japanese silk opening at low prices, the Italian silk market is increasingly trending downward.

<p>Yesterday, the local foreign firm tea market saw the Russian Assistance Association resuming sales of Gongxi green tea from Wuyuan and Tunxi, with a total of more than 300 boxes sold. The selling price was unchanged from before. Jinlong, Yihuo, and other firms continued to search for needle eyebrow and show eyebrow, etc., and their stocks have been exhausted. However, Zhenmei's sales remained sluggish, and tea prices were falling rather than rising.</p>

<p>After the shortage of American galvanized iron, various firms have been actively purchasing Red Bird brand British galvanized iron, so there is sometimes a shortage of goods in the market, and therefore, general purchasers sometimes have no goods to buy. Yesterday, 500 loads of spot goods arrived at Huishan Wharf, so customer firms who generally buy this product were all overjoyed upon hearing this news. It was found that 270 to 280 loads have been opened, with prices at 17 taels, 7 qian, and 5 fen per load, and individual estimates at 1 tael and 5 qian and 2 fen per sheet.

<h3 id="e135">Yesterday's Third Preparatory Meeting of Beijing-Guangdong Representatives <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The So-Called Uniformity in Foreign Affairs Received Clear Explanation Yesterday</p>
<p>The Central Political System Will Be Further Discussed Today</p>
<p>Both Sides' Representatives Yesterday Telegraphed Guangdong to Express Condolences for the Death of Gu</p>
<p>The Beijing and Guangdong representatives held the third preparatory meeting at the same location yesterday morning at 10:00 AM. Guangdong representative Zou Lu was absent due to illness, and Beijing representative Li Shizeng also requested Wu Tiecheng to represent him due to illness. The meeting continued to discuss foreign affairs issues and the reform of the central system. The first item on the meeting agenda was concluded yesterday, and the discussion of the fifth item began, but no concrete results were achieved. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 PM, and it was decided to continue the discussion at the fourth preparatory meeting today. The proceedings of yesterday are summarized below:</p>
<p>He and Wang Met Before the Meeting　Wang Jingwei arrived at the meeting at 9:00 AM. While he was meeting with Wu Chaoshu, He Yingqin came to the meeting to visit Wang due to some important matters. Wang then met with He in another room. Subsequently, Chen Youren, Sun Ke, Fu Bingchang, Li Wenfan, and Nanjing representatives Chen Mingshu, Zhang Jingjiang, Cai Yuanpei, Zhang Ji, and Wu Tiecheng arrived one after another at 9:30 AM. Li Shizeng was absent due to illness and was still represented by Wu Tiecheng. Zou Lu was also absent due to a cold. At 9:55 AM, He finished talking with Wang, and then announced the opening of the meeting at about 10:00 AM. The two sides discussed for about two hours and adjourned at 12:00 PM.</p>
<p>Situation During the Meeting　The General Assembly issued a statement yesterday regarding the situation of the meeting, stating that at today's (i.e., yesterday's) meeting, Chairman Cai Yuanpei read the Prime Minister's will. Representative Wang gave a temporary report, stating that he had just received a telegram from Guangdong comrades informing him that Mr. Gu Xiangqin had passed away at 6:00 PM yesterday (i.e., the day before), and proposed a three-minute silence to express condolences. All representatives stood in silence and performed the ceremony. First, more detailed and thorough discussions were held on the foreign affairs issue, and a decision was made on further measures (the publishable content is recorded separately below). Then, the discussion on the improvement of the central political system was continued. After the representatives expressed their opinions as much as possible, it was decided to summarize the various opinions into a proposal, which will be further discussed at the fourth meeting tomorrow (i.e., today).</p>
<p>Yesterday's Discussion of the Fifth Item　According to inquiries by this newspaper's reporter, at yesterday's meeting, Guangdong representative Wu Chaoshu first raised the so-called issue of limited uniformity in foreign affairs. After discussion among the participants, the following decision was made. As a result, the first item in the seven principles proposed in the letter from the Guangdong representatives, namely, "First seek uniform action in foreign affairs," was concluded. The second and third items did not need to be discussed. The fourth item concerned party affairs. The original text of the fifth item was "The Chairman of the National Government is proposed to be modeled after the presidential systems of France and Germany, with a senior and respected comrade serving as the chairman, and active military personnel should not be elected." Following the order, the fourth item should not have been discussed. Because the fifth item was more urgent, Sun Ke proposed to start the discussion. There were many opinions from the representatives, and it was decided to continue the discussion today.</p>
<p>Minutes of the Three Meetings　The General Assembly officially issued the agenda yesterday as follows: (A) Attending representatives: Chen Mingshu, Zhang Ji, Chen Youren, Sun Ke, Wang Zhaoming, Li Wenfan, Wu Chaoshu, Zhang Jingjiang, Cai Yuanpei, Wu Tiecheng, chaired by Cai Yuanpei, with Cheng Zhonghang, Yang Zongjiong, Qiu Jinxian, and Zhong Tianxin as recorders. (B) Resolutions: (1) The following explanation was made regarding uniformity in foreign affairs: The so-called uniformity in foreign affairs is limited, such as non-resistance when foreign troops invade, or no one taking responsibility for the loss of territory. The meeting cannot express uniformity on such policies and situations. (2) Regarding the reform plan of the central system, Representative Sun is requested to prepare a concrete plan and submit it for discussion at tomorrow's (i.e., today's) meeting. (3) The fourth meeting will be held at 9:00 AM on October 30th.</p>
<p>Representatives Sent Telegrams of Condolence for Gu's Death　The Beijing and Guangdong representatives sent telegrams of condolence yesterday for the death of Gu Yingfen, saying: (1) To the Extraordinary Conference of the Central Executive and Supervisory Committee in Guangzhou: Upon receiving the telegram, we were shocked to learn that Mr. Gu Xiangqin passed away at 6:00 PM on the 28th. Times are difficult, and the overall situation is uncertain. The sudden death of a senior and experienced person is deeply painful. We send this telegram to express our condolences and hope for your compassion. Wang Zhaoming, Sun Ke, Li Wenfan, Wu Chaoshu, Chen Youren, Zou Lu, sincerely. (2) To Mr. Chen Bonan in Guangzhou: Convey to Mrs. Gu Xiangqin our condolences upon receiving the news of Mr. Xiangqin's death. The nation is in distress, and the sudden death of a senior and experienced person leaves the country in mourning. We have shared hardships and deeply mourn. We offer our condolences. Li Yu, Zhang Ji, Cai Yuanpei, Zhang Renjie, Chen Mingshu, sincerely. (3) To Mrs. Gu and siblings at the Gu residence on Cangbian Street in Guangzhou: We are deeply saddened by Mr. Xiangweng's passing, both from a public and private perspective. We hope you will restrain your grief and accept the changes. We send this telegram to offer our condolences and hope for your consideration. Li Wenfan, Zou Lu, Wu Chaoshu, Chen Youren, Wang Jingwei, Sun Ke, sincerely.</p>
<p>Issue of System Change　Yesterday morning, at the third preparatory meeting, when Wu Chaoshu proposed an explanation of the "so-called uniformity in foreign affairs," after discussion and decision by the participants, the representatives at the meeting all believed that the preparatory meeting should promptly discuss important issues, and the others, which were secondary, could be left for later discussion. Therefore, the fifth item of the seven principles proposed by the Guangdong side, namely, the "Reform Plan of the Central System," was brought forward for discussion. As a result, Sun Zhesheng was publicly recommended to prepare a concrete plan and submit it to the fourth meeting for further discussion. After the meeting adjourned, this newspaper's reporter, considering that this case was of great importance to the central administrative system, specially visited Mr. Sun Zhesheng and was received. The following is a summary of his reform opinions on this case. Mr. Sun said, "I believe that the current central system grants too much power to the chairman. Therefore, I advocate reforming the current central system by imitating the nature of the cabinet systems of Germany and France, that is, to establish a 'National Government Committee' composed of members of the National Government, and still have a chairman of the National Government who represents the country externally and exercises political power internally. In other words, the National Government Committee is the same as the parliaments of Germany and France, and the chairman of the National Government is the same as the presidents of Germany and France, but the name is still chairman and not president. As for the president of the Executive Yuan, he is similar to the prime ministers of Germany and France and must be responsible to the National Government Committee." At this point, the reporter asked, "Then will the other four yuan be changed?" Mr. Sun replied, "The other four yuan will not be changed, but in fact, the focus of the five yuan's functions and implementation is still on the Executive Yuan. Therefore, it is very important that the Executive Yuan be responsible to the National Government Committee." The reporter asked whether the chairman of the National Government could still concurrently serve as the president of the Executive Yuan, and how the candidates for the chairman of the National Government and the members of the National Government would be produced. Mr. Sun replied that, according to the German and French systems, the members of the National Government should be elected by the people of the whole country, and this point still needs to be considered. However, the chairman of the National Government should be publicly recommended by all members of the National Government. As for the number of members of the National Government, it will naturally increase in the future, but the number is still to be discussed. The reporter asked whether the current Central Political Conference would continue to exist after the central system is reformed according to this proposal. Mr. Sun replied, "Of course, there is no need for the Central Political Conference to exist anymore, because the National Government Committee is the highest political organ in the country." The reporter asked, "What is your opinion on the abolition of the commander-in-chief?" Mr. Sun replied, "I advocate abolition, because under the National Government, the Ministry of Military Affairs and the General Staff Headquarters are jointly responsible for military affairs. Therefore, it seems unnecessary to establish a commander-in-chief in peacetime. As for declaring war on foreign countries, it is of course necessary to establish one for the convenience of command." The reporter asked, "Have you discussed party affairs in the meetings these days?" Mr. Sun replied, "No." The reporter asked, "In your opinion, when will the preparatory meeting be completed?" Mr. Sun replied, "It will probably be completed soon." At this point, another guest arrived, and the reporter took his leave.</p>
<p>Hu Visited Wang and Wu　Hu Hanmin suddenly suffered from abdominal pain the day before yesterday and was cured by Dr. Deng Zhende. Yesterday morning at 8:00 AM, representatives from the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union and the Water and Electricity Workers' Union, among others, visited Hu's residence. Wang Jingwei, Wu Chaoshu, and others were present. Hu, Wang, and others went out to meet them and talked for a long time. Hu felt quite tired. At that time, he happened to receive a telegram from Guangdong informing him of the death of Gu Yingfen. Hu had a deep personal relationship with Gu and was extremely saddened, even to the point of fainting. He was quickly treated by a doctor and recovered after about an hour. Yesterday afternoon at about 3:00 PM, Hu, accompanied by Li Wenfan, visited Wang Jingwei at 157 Seymour Road and talked for about two hours. Until about 5:00 PM, Hu and Li went together to Wu's residence on Gordon Road to attend a banquet.</p>
<p>Declaration of the Eight District Party Departments　The eight district party departments of this city, including the first, second, fifth, sixth, eighth, ninth, and tenth districts, expressed serious opinions on the current situation yesterday and issued a declaration, saying: "At a time when the nation is in deep distress and foreign aggression is imminent, and the danger to the nation's survival is imminent, all comrades of our party should uphold the spirit of defending the country against foreign enemies and unite to jointly resist foreign aggression, eliminate internal conflicts, and increase the nation's strength. This is the attitude that our party comrades should have in loving the party and saving the country, and it is also what the people of the whole country earnestly expect from the party. However, the way to save the country is even more urgent than putting out a fire. In the face of national crisis, our party comrades should be ready to fight at any moment, and there is no time for lengthy discussions and arguments. If saving the country is the premise, then any personal opinions can be sacrificed, any misunderstandings can be avoided, and there is no need for any form of meeting or any bargaining of conditions. If we treat each other with sincerity, then everyone can be forgiven. If we act with impartiality, then there is no room for exploitation. As for the central political system, it is related to the organization of our party, and the system of our party is based on the due process of laws and regulations, which cannot be easily changed. The reason why the previous special committee did not meet the expectations of the public was that it tampered with the party's laws and regulations. If we repeat the same mistakes, then we will only make things worse. Therefore, today, the only way is to concentrate the talents within the party on the existing central system and strengthen the political power, which is the most important task for saving the country at present. Moreover, when the diplomatic situation is increasingly isolated, if we change the central system and rashly change the international status, it will not only contradict the desire to resist Japan and save the country, but also go against the original intention of our advanced comrades to unite against foreign aggression. Since the foundation of our party is based on public opinion, all our actions should be in accordance with public opinion. Today, what the people expect from our party is that our party comrades can eliminate regionalism and unite unconditionally to confront foreign aggression. It is only when we regard the demands of the Guangzhou side as the starting point for cultivating democratic politics. Otherwise, we will only focus on petty gains and losses and waste time in endless disputes, ignoring the country's crisis and foreign aggression. How can we save the country from imminent danger? How can we meet the expectations of the people? And the so-called democratic politics will only become an empty slogan to deceive people. Therefore, today's affairs have no more urgent task than saving the country, and no more important issue than dealing with foreign aggression. We should quickly unite sincerely, join hands to enter Beijing, and devote all our efforts to saving the country and resisting foreign aggression, which is the only way out for all advanced comrades. As for political organization and national construction, we should firmly adhere to the Prime Minister's outline for national construction as the only fundamental code of law. The imperfections of personnel have nothing to do with the laws and regulations themselves. It is not to value people but to value laws and regulations. Even if there are good laws and systems, without people who abide by and implement the laws and regulations, they are equal to empty words and waste paper. Therefore, the key to governance lies not in the laws but in the people. We should restrain people to abide by the laws, not change the laws to accommodate people. Only by abiding by the laws can we promote the transition from rule by people to rule by law. Only rule by law can guarantee the realization of democratic politics. Otherwise, valuing people over the law will not only be a disguised form of dictatorship, but also a major obstacle to democratic politics. The gains and losses in this are of great importance. One mistake will affect the whole situation. We hope that the people of the country will learn from this."</p>
<p>Declaration of Various Trade Unions in This City　(Titles Omitted) Since the revolution, due to different political views, chaos and disasters have followed one after another, and there has been no peaceful year. The suffering of the people of the whole country is no less than in the era of warlords, which is very regrettable. It was hoped that after the success of the revolution, the political situation would gradually become peaceful, and all of the Prime Minister's proposals for peace and the genuine liberation of the people could be realized one by one. However, the selfish views of power have not been eliminated, and the political situation is even more unstable. Internal strife has led to foreign aggression. The Japanese imperialists, who have been watching for a long time but have not dared to act, have now dared to carry out their great violence. Therefore, our so-called revolutionary government should regard this as a deep hatred and humiliation. Therefore, if our party comrades still do not abandon their personal views and jointly face the national crisis at this time, it is unknown what kind of heart they have. Fortunately, all parties have deeply realized their mistakes and repented. The sincerity of all parties in regretting their mistakes is not without hope for the future of the Republic of China. However, to resist foreign aggression, we must first stabilize the country. To stabilize the country, we must first advocate war. The results of years of civil war have clearly shown us that the dream of military force is not achievable, and the Prime Minister's proposal for peaceful struggle is almost the only way to save China. Only with peace can we achieve unity, and only with genuine peace can we expect the sympathy of the whole country. This peaceful conference has brought together all parties. If all parties can meet each other with sincerity, it will be a great plan for saving the country and will be recognized by the people. We hope that the representatives will do their best to eliminate their prejudices, show accommodation, and make concessions. In the future, all party, government, and military affairs should follow the Prime Minister's teachings, re-establish policies, and implement them carefully. It is hoped that in the cooperation between the two sides, all kinds of disputes can be resolved, and then we can strive to revitalize and unite against foreign aggression. We must have the determination to break the cauldrons and sink the boats and go to the common goal without hesitation. The national crisis is imminent, and we will not resign until death. This is what all parties are responsible for today, and it is also what the people are eagerly hoping for. Indeed, at this critical moment, the survival of the country is at stake. If the country survives, we will all survive. If the country perishes, we will all perish. The people of the whole country will never ignore those who outwardly advocate peace but secretly plot destruction, or even use resistance against foreign aggression as a facade while actually having ulterior motives. They will not only be the public enemy of the people of the whole country, but also the sinners of China for all ages. We hereby declare this together with the people of the country.

<h3 id="e136">Shanghai Chinese Merchants' Ships Dismiss Japanese Crew Members <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Jing Shun Steamer Begins</p>
<p>Haitong Dismisses Japanese Seafarers　The Jing Shun Steamer of Haitong Steamer Company in this port uses six Japanese crew members, including the captain, first mate, second mate, and chief engineer. Since the recent invasion of our national territory by the violent Japanese, the Chinese people have unanimously carried out an economic boycott against Japan. The company has also dismissed the hired captain, first mate, second mate, and other personnel. Since there is no contract restriction, the agreement can be terminated at any time. The Jing Shun Steamer arrived in Shanghai from Haizhou yesterday. After entering the Huai River, it stopped at Pier 31 to unload cargo. The company then notified the Japanese to immediately leave their posts and disembark.</p>
<p>Chinese Personnel Take Over, Dispute Arises　Before the Japanese crew members were dismissed, the company had already hired Hu Xiyuan as the captain and hired Huang Duncai, Chen Rongsheng, and others as chief and second engineers. They were scheduled to take over their duties on the ship yesterday afternoon. However, after the new captain arrived on the ship, a major dispute arose when Huang and Chen boarded the ship. The Nanjing Marine Engineering Association did not allow Huang and others to serve as chief and second engineers, saying that the association should send people to fill the posts. Huang and Chen argued that they were appointed by Haitong and approved by the Navigation Administration Bureau. Neither side would give way, and the engine room almost wanted to resolve the matter by force. The new captain, fearing that the Japanese had not yet left the ship and that this would provoke an incident, or that the Japanese would refuse to hand over their duties on the pretext, which would inevitably lead to disputes, persuaded Huang and others to report to the Navigation Bureau for resolution.</p>
<p>Petition the Navigation Bureau for Disposition　After Huang Duncai and Chen Rongsheng left, the Marine Engineering Association, without waiting for the order of the Navigation Bureau, immediately appointed He Shengcai and Cai Xuenian to board the ship and take over the positions of chief and second engineers. Huang and Chen immediately took the Haitong appointment letter and the registration certificate from the Navigation Bureau to report to the Navigation Administration Bureau and requested a ruling. At that time, Director Xi Zhongmou happened to be out, and they were instructed to go to the Bureau this morning to discuss the matter. It has been verified that Haitong Steamer is the first ship in Shanghai to dismiss Japanese crew members and replace them with Chinese crew members. From today onwards, if any Chinese merchant ships employ Japanese personnel and do not dismiss them, they will not be allowed to sail. This intention has been notified to all steamer bureaus for their information.</p>

<p>Silk and Satin Industry Seriously Investigates Japanese Goods</p>
<p>Non-Members Limited to Three Days to Report for Inspection</p>
<p>The Shanghai Silk and Satin Industry Association has been conducting inspections of Japanese goods in the silk and satin industry since the 15th of this month. Teams have been working continuously without interruption. As of yesterday, all member stores have been inspected. However, among the non-member businesses, only a few have reported for inspection since the announcement was published in the newspaper.

The list of money exchanges has been submitted to your association for review and implementation. In this regard, since these money exchanges are well aware of the righteousness and are united in resisting Japan, if the Japanese words on the signboard are not removed, they will still leave a stain and it will be difficult to cut off the impression. In response to the previous report, we hereby send this letter, hoping that you will quickly remove the Japanese words 'exchange' or 'exchange merchant' on your signboards. To: Guang Sheng, Shun Tai Xiang, Ding Yuan Yi He Kang, Hua Chang, Rui He, Tai Xing, Gong Li, Chen Yongfeng, Ming Kang, Yuan Tai, Xie Da Chang, and other small money exchanges.</p>

The case has been investigated and verified by the association. In this regard, since violent Japanese are rampant, the whole country is in common anger, and all our countrymen have a firm determination to resist Japan. These shipping agents are also compatriots, but how can they be so insensible and still be used by the Japanese to make a living from selling ship tickets, thereby cutting themselves off from the Chinese people? In response to the report, this special letter is sent as a warning, hoping that you will stop selling Japanese ship tickets as soon as possible, so as to avoid public anger. To: Xin Kaihe Yazhou, Xing Tai, Wan Shun, Bao Kangxiang, Ju Kang, Li Kang, De Mao, Feng Tai, Gong Ji, Li Yuan, Shun Tai, Yazhou in the Catholic Church Lane on Fada Road, De Mao at 16th Pier, and other shipping agents.</p>

<h3 id="e138">Second General Meeting of the YMCA Members <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The YMCA Members Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association held its first general meeting at the Shanghai YMCA auditorium at 5:30 pm on the 28th. The presiding group consisted of Gu Zhiling, Tan Bozhi, and Peng Zunlu, with approximately a thousand people in attendance. Yin Zhiling delivered the opening address. Wang Zaoshi gave a speech on "The Unification Conference and the Future of China." Tan Bozhi reported on the association's activities. Ren Zuojun reported on the economic plan. Mai delivered a speech on "Concrete Measures for Anti-Japanese National Salvation." Subsequently, a public discussion was held. The association reached a resolution to issue a circular telegram regarding its important propositions and work concerning the serious current situation. The meeting adjourned at 8:00 pm. The full text of the circular telegram is recorded below: "The Japanese have long coveted Manchuria and Mongolia, and are actively preparing to encroach on China. They threaten to seize Taiwan, forcibly occupy Dalian, and coerce us into signing the Twenty-One Demands of the fourth year of the Republic. Through enticements and cunning schemes, they collude with warlords and incite internal strife. Their viciousness and cruelty arouse the indignation of both heaven and man. Yet, our government and people, both high and low, turn a blind eye. We haggle over trivial gains and losses, and make no substantial preparations for self-defense. Calamities arise one after another. We resort to slogans and banners to confront violence. When the enemy arrives, we are ordered to surrender and disarm as a matter of course. If this is how a nation is governed, how can it escape natural selection? Now, the Japanese are intensifying their aggression. Their troops are approaching the key cities of Guanzhong. The state of affairs is critical. Survival is uncertain. Yet, the officials in charge in the North and South continue to vacillate in peace talks, using empty words on paper as their banner, without any practical methods for saving the nation. Could it be that they believe the party and the nation can be separate, and that the party can survive even if the nation perishes? Our association, as patriotic citizens, witnessing the national crisis looming and the danger of national destruction, in addition to following the lead of other national salvation associations, unanimously urge the government to quickly unify the nation and prepare to resist foreign aggression. Regarding this Japanese military aggression, we have resolved to issue five propositions as follows, hoping for public awareness: (1) The people of the whole country, regardless of party affiliation, should concentrate talent and unite to resist aggression. (2) Anyone who exploits the national crisis to advance their private interests should be considered a public enemy of the nation. (3) No one is allowed to conclude secret treaties with Japan that sacrifice national sovereignty. Violators will be deemed guilty of treason. (4) Before the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops, we insist on opposing direct negotiations. (5) The government's diplomacy with Japan should be based on the will of the people and announce its policies publicly."</p>

<h3 id="e140">Yesterday, the Zhonghua Book Company Resumed Work <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>The Minzhi Book Company Continues Its Work Stoppage.</p>
<p>The Municipal Government Scheduled to Convene Arbitration.</p>
<p>After all the employees of the Zhonghua and Minzhi Book Companies went on strike, the employees of Zhonghua followed the order and resumed work yesterday. Minzhi continued its work stoppage yesterday. The Social Affairs Bureau ordered Minzhi yesterday to comply with the previous order and allow Jin Shifa to resume work. The details of each situation are recorded separately below. Zhonghua Resumes Work.</p>
<p>The Publishing Industry Association, in order to comply with the order, accompanied Li Hongbin, a worker from the Zhonghua Book Company, to resume work at 7:00 am yesterday. It also persuaded all the employees of the general factory and distribution office to work as usual. As a result, all the employees immediately stopped the work stoppage and worked as usual. However, Tu Jinshi, the deputy director of the general factory printing office, had to consult with the general manager regarding Li Hongbin's resumption of work. It is reported that after Li Hongbin entered the letterpress printing department, the capital side did not assign him any work. All the employees were very angry when they heard the news.</p>
<p>Notice to Employees. The Zhonghua Book Company, after a resolution by the board of directors, announced to all employees yesterday: The council resolved in a meeting that it will report to the Social Affairs Bureau for investigation and handling the situation of a small number of workers and shop assistants forcing a work stoppage and preventing customers from entering the store. If it is absolutely necessary, legal remedies may be sought. In addition, it received a letter from 53 people at the main store asking how wages would be paid in the future for those who did not participate in the work stoppage. After deliberation, the council decided that: (1) Those who did not participate in the work stoppage and worked as usual will be paid their wages as usual. (2) Those who participated in the work stoppage will not be paid their wages. (3) Those who did not want to participate in the work stoppage but were forced to not work should notify the department head or section chief to register, and wages will be paid as usual after verification.</p>
<p>Order from the Social Affairs Bureau. All the workers of the Minzhi Book Company continued to strike yesterday. The Publishing Industry Association received an order from the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, which stated roughly: In order to comply with the order, the case of the Minzhi Book Company dismissing worker Jin Shifa, in addition to ordering the bureau to comply with the previous order, it is ordered that it be obeyed and that all workers be instructed to quickly resume work as usual. This order is crucial. The association immediately convened a meeting to discuss how to proceed.</p>
<p>Submission from the Chamber of Commerce. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce submitted a letter to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau regarding the work stoppage of the Zhonghua Book Company employees, stating roughly that the case originated from a mutual fight between worker Li Hongbin and a comrade in the same machine. In order to stabilize business and avoid disputes, the employer dismissed him as usual. The person concerned had no objection. Later, a cadre of the Publishing Industry Association raised an objection and reported to the bureau, requesting reinstatement. After approval, he was given a demerit and allowed to resume work. The printing office of the company replied that it had not received an order from the company and would notify it after the board of directors made a decision. The employer did not refuse reinstatement. However, the cadre of the union did not comply with Article 23 of the Labor Union Law and forcibly instigated a strike. When it failed, he instigated the shop assistants to stage a work stoppage and sent people to the store to obstruct customers. Such arbitrary obstruction of the company's business caused the company to invoke Articles 27, Section 1 and 7 of the Labor Union Law or Article 74 of the Factory Law and other provisions, requesting severe punishment in accordance with the law. It is appropriate to submit a request to the bureau for review and approval and to take legal action.</p>
<p>Petition from Representatives. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce believed that the workers' work stoppage was a disguised strike and should be prohibited by the party and government organs. The Standing Committee decided to publicly recommend Committee Members Ye Huijun and Zhu Wenqi to go to the Municipal Government, the Municipal Party Headquarters, and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to request that it be stopped.</p>
<p>Order from the Party Headquarters. It is reported that the Municipal Party Headquarters has strictly ordered the Publishing Industry Workers' Union to instruct the workers of the two book companies to resume work immediately and await mediation. The document stated: For the strict enforcement of the order, it is reported that the workers of the Zhonghua and Minzhi Book Companies went on strike due to the failure to reach an agreement with the capital side on the terms and conditions of labor and capital. In view of the current national crisis and the urgency of foreign aggression, both labor and capital should unite and not engage in disputes. The Zhonghua and Minzhi Book Companies workers are ordered to comply with the case. They should immediately instruct the workers to resume work immediately. All disputes over the terms and conditions should be resolved through mediation in accordance with the law, and should not be resisted or delayed, so as not to cause inconvenience. This order is crucial.</p>
<p>Scheduled Arbitration. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau declared that mediation of the Zhonghua Book Company's employees' treatment conditions was unsuccessful and submitted it to the Municipal Government for arbitration. Yesterday, the Shanghai Municipal Labor and Capital Arbitration Committee notified both labor and capital, stating that the committee is scheduled to arbitrate the case of the Zhonghua Book Company's labor demands for improved treatment at 1:00 pm on Saturday, October 31st. Representatives are requested to appear on time to state their views and await arbitration. This notice is issued by Chairman and Committee Member Sun Baorong.</p>

<p>Because it hinders the prospects for resisting Japan.</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Shipping Industry Association yesterday, saying: "On the 28th of this month, the Municipal Book Industry Guild stated that the Wenwantang Xinji Book Company stated that the Xinxingtai Customs Brokerage Company said, 'Recently, Japanese ships have stopped loading, and Chinese ships have raised fares across the board, calculating costs, at least four yuan, three or four cents per box. The above-mentioned price is the shipping price per box of books from Shanghai to Wuhan. At normal times, the shipping cost per box of books is two yuan and eight cents. At present, we boycott Japanese ships, and Chinese ships have suddenly increased the fares by more than half. I don't know what kind of reason or said that the boycott of Japanese ships, Chinese ships are not enough to meet the needs, so the price increase, I intend to price increases and whether the ships can meet the needs, is two completely different issues. The occurrence of this bad situation is not only a great violation of the purpose of resisting Japan and saving the country, but also hinders the progress of commerce, etc.' The association checked that during this national crisis, it is expected that the various rounds will not increase prices for shipping goods. In addition to sending a letter to inquire about the Shipping Industry Association, I have reached this point, respectfully hoping for your consideration, etc. Check the current implementation of economic sanctions against Japan, and the boycott of Japanese ships is determined to transport, and the so-called Chinese ships taking the opportunity to increase fares is operated by merchants who are blind to short-term interests, and is detrimental to the future of the anti-Japanese war. It is appropriate to send a letter to the Shipping Industry Association, hoping that you will find out the truth and persuade them to stop it, etc." This is addressed to the Shanghai Shipping Industry Association.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Although the Tram is Running After the Electric Company's Work Stoppage, Tickets are Not Sold. <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>The Public Security Bureau Sends Police to Protect the Traffic.</p>
<p>The Party Headquarters Mediation Has a Concrete Solution.</p>
<p>The Staff Will Meet and May Resume Work This Morning.</p>
<p>After the work stoppage of all the staff of the Municipal Chinese Electric Company, the Social Affairs Bureau strictly ordered it to be stopped and reported it to the Municipal Government, which quickly summoned a public decision. The Municipal Party Headquarters took on the task of mediation, and it is reported that there are concrete measures. Although the tram ran as usual yesterday, the ticket sales were stopped. The Public Security Bureau sent police to protect it. The details of each situation are recorded below.</p>
<p>Tram Blocked. After all the staff went on strike for the terms and conditions of treatment the day before yesterday, the staff of the traffic department immediately stopped arranging shifts, stopping the car, and issuing tickets. As a result, all the workers of the traffic department went to work yesterday morning, but no one was assigned work and no tickets could be sold. They had no choice but to stand in the company and wait for work. The tram was originally scheduled to leave the factory at 5:45 am, but as a result, it did not leave the factory until 7:00 am.</p>
<p>Protect the Traffic. Chen Xizeng, Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, heard that the Chinese tram was suspended due to the staff's work stoppage. In order to maintain traffic and social order, he ordered the Second District Police Station to send a patrol officer from the Gaochangmiao Police Station to the Electric Company to persuade them to run as usual to facilitate traffic. Therefore, at 7:30 am, the trams on all routes started to leave the factory. Drivers sold tickets and worked on the same shift as the day before. However, no one issued tickets, so they had to run the tram without selling tickets. The Public Security Bureau sent more than 20 armed policemen from the Police Brigade and eight armed policemen from the Second District to distribute to the car for protection.</p>
<p>Traffic Situation. Yesterday, the Chinese trams ran nine vehicles on Route 1 from Xiaodongmen to Gaochangli, four vehicles on Route 2 from Xiaodongmen to Ximen, eight vehicles on Route 3 with trailers, and six vehicles on Route 4 from Ximen to Gaochangmiao. Because there were no tickets sold in the car, the general public was happy to take the ride. As a result, the number of passengers increased several times compared to the past, and the trams were crowded.

<p>It Is Feared That They Will Not Be Able to Attend This Session.</p>
<p>The Zi Lin Bao reported that when the Pacific Society met on Wednesday afternoon, it unanimously decided to allow the Soviet Union to formally join the society and telegraphed that night to invite a representative to attend the meeting to discuss everything. This matter has been discussed by the society and Soviet scientific groups for a long time. The acting secretary-general of the society, Lumis, has been to Moscow several times in recent years to discuss with Russian representatives. When the society met in Xijing in 1929, a Russian observer was present. Since then, Russian scientific and cultural groups have paid attention to the activities of the society and organized the Pacific Committee. The society is now telegraphing the committee to invite representatives to join the discussion. However, it is too late this year, and they will not be able to attend. According to Lumis, the committee has no relationship with Soviet political activities, and most of its members are not communists. At the society's discussion on Wednesday, attention was focused on the Manchurian issue, and Chinese and Japanese representatives debated fiercely. Hua Junchi, the private secretary of the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Drummond, was also present as an observer. Mr. Hua arrived in Shanghai from Europe specifically for this matter.</p>

<h3 id="e149">Urgent Fundraising for Winter Relief <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Allocation of Winter Relief Quotas to Various Provinces</p>
<p>The Shanghai Fundraising Committee for Emergency Relief for Flood Victims in Various Provinces held its 74th regular meeting yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM. Attendees included Huang Hanzhi, Ma Youfeng, Qu Wenliu, Xu Shiying, Yu Zhi'ang, Li Zhian, Du Yuesheng, Wang Ting, Zhu Ziqiao, Zhang Gongheng, Jin Guanfu, Wu Zhijuan, Zhang Zhijiang (representing Weng Guoxun), Qian Junren, Ha Shaofu, Wang Xiaolai, and others. They elected Xu Shiying as chairman and Yang Jichun as recorder. First, Zhang Gongheng, special commissioner for disaster relief in southern Anhui, reported on the disaster relief situation in seven counties in southern Anhui. Then, Li Ji, special commissioner for disaster relief in Hubei, reported on the recent situation of disaster relief and recommended Zhou Xingtang as the special commissioner for disaster relief in Hubei in his place. Next, the following proposals were discussed and resolved: (1) The previous regular meeting resolved that the standing committee members would immediately determine emergency winter relief measures. Now that a plan has been drafted, it was approved. (2) You Xiwun, representative of the Huangyan Rice Industry Association, offered to handle 20,000 bags of relief rice for the committee at a price reduced by two yuan from the current lowest rice price in Shanghai. The resolution was temporarily reserved. (3) Xu Guozhi telegraphed that nine porridge kitchens must be established in central Anhui immediately, each requiring at least tens of thousands of yuan. Whether to set up more will be considered after the relief workers have submitted complete reports. (4) Xu Guohuai telegraphed detailed plans for winter relief in central Anhui, where over 3.9 million people in 15 disaster-stricken counties need relief. Distributing 20% of the relief funds would require over 780,000 yuan, and distributing 10% in winter clothing would require over 390,000 sets of cotton clothes. How to approve this request? (5) The Shaanxi Provincial Relief Association telegraphed that the weather is getting colder and winter relief is imminent. They propose setting up porridge kitchens in severely affected areas and request funds. (6) The Relief Association received a telegram from the Guizhou Chinese and Foreign Relief Association stating that the counties along the Yuan and Zhu rivers in that province have suffered severely and requesting relief. It was resolved that the above four proposals be handled under winter relief. (7) The Anhui Provincial Relief Association sent a letter with plans for flood relief, including emergency relief, agricultural relief, and industrial relief, and requested additional assistance. The resolution was passed. (8) The total amount of requests for industrial relief from various locations has exceeded ten million yuan. The committee is unable to handle this, and the funds needed for relief and seeds alone would require tens of thousands of yuan per province. Each province also needs hundreds of thousands of sets of cotton clothes. The committee's relief income is gradually decreasing. How should we raise funds? The resolution was handed over to the fundraising group. (9) The current allocation of relief funds to various provinces is inevitably skewed based on requests. More requests result in more allocation, and no requests result in no allocation, which is unfair. Now that the disaster situation in each province is generally clear, it is proposed to establish concrete measures based on the actual situation to avoid favoring some and neglecting others. The resolution was to calculate the distribution of the two winter emergency relief funds as a percentage, with Anhui receiving 15%, Jiangsu and Hubei each receiving 12%, Henan, Hunan, and Jiangxi each receiving 10%, Zhejiang receiving 4%, Guizhou receiving 3%, and Shandong, Shaanxi, Gansu, and other provinces totaling 24%. (10) A letter from the publicity group. It was resolved to invite Xu Jingren, Zhu Ziqiao, Li Zuli, and Weng Guoxun to negotiate. (11) A letter from Sa Zhenbing of Fujian stating that he was honored to be appointed as an executive member and special commissioner for disaster relief by the committee, but felt unable to shoulder such a heavy responsibility. However, he could try his best within the Ningde and Gutian areas. The resolution was to send a letter requesting his hard work. (12) A letter from the Shanghai Municipal Association of Traditional Chinese Medicine stating that the association is responsible for diagnosis and medication at the disaster relief shelters, and this will continue in the future. They request the committee to provide subsidies for medication in the future. The resolution was to approve the subsidy.</p>
<p>Winter Emergency Relief Rules Passed</p>
<p>The Shanghai Fundraising Committee for Emergency Relief for Flood Victims in Various Provinces passed 16 articles of rules for handling winter emergency relief at its meeting yesterday. The original text is as follows: (1) Each province will have one chief director, named "Chief Director of the Shanghai Fundraising Committee for Emergency Relief for Flood Victims in Various Provinces for XX Province." (Referred to as "the Committee" below) The chief director will be responsible for relief in various counties of that province. The relief workers dispatched will be named "Relief Director of the Committee for XX Province, XX County." (2) The chief director will be hired by the Committee, and the directors of each province will be recommended by the chief director and hired by the Committee. (3) The Committee will issue each provincial chief director a seal, with the inscription "Seal of the Chief Director of the Shanghai Fundraising Committee for Emergency Relief for Flood Victims in XX Province." The seal used by the county directors will be inscribed "Seal of the Relief Director of the Committee for XX Province, XX County." The style will be determined by the Committee and issued locally by the provincial chief director, with a report to the Committee for record. (4) Relief tickets, flags, and armbands will be issued by the Committee to the chief director, who will distribute them to the county directors for use. (5) The Committee's relief efforts will focus on areas not covered by official relief or will be discussed and demarcated with official relief agencies in advance to achieve effective division of labor and cooperation, avoiding duplication and bias. (6) The provincial chief directors and county directors dispatched by the Committee will, in principle, not concurrently handle other relief work. However, if necessary, they must obtain the Committee's permission. (7) If other relief organizations wish to conduct relief work in the counties designated by the Committee, they may either demarcate areas within the county and conduct relief separately, or merge the relief funds into the Committee's relief funds for joint distribution. However, for joint distribution, the relief tickets must be stamped with the joint distribution mark of the XX relief organization. (8) When handling winter relief, the directors should conduct on-site surveys based on the local situation to determine whether seeds, cotton clothes, porridge kitchens, food, cash, or industrial relief are needed. The chief director will then report to the Committee for approval and implementation. (9) The investigation will be handled by the relief workers, and the relief funds should be handed over to the local county government and legal organizations to distribute the relief tickets and retain the stubs. The chief director will collect the stubs and submit them to the Committee. The relief tickets will be collected by the county government and sent back to the Committee along with the receipts for the relief funds distributed. (10) Since the Committee is a relief organization, it should follow the principles of strict investigation, lenient distribution, and saving the dying, not the poor. All other relief methods are printed in the book "Humble Opinions on Relief, Important Points on Relief," which is issued to all relief workers and handled according to past relief methods. (11) Each provincial office may employ two to four clerks to handle documents, general affairs, accounting, and inspection. However, the monthly living expenses should not exceed twenty yuan. Each county branch office may employ one or two clerks to handle internal affairs. However, the monthly living expenses should not exceed twenty yuan. (12) Relief expenses will be disbursed by the Committee to the relief workers when they depart. If the amount is insufficient, the chief director may request an increase. However, all relief expenses will be paid from the relief funds. Spending one extra penny means one less penny for the victims, and saving one penny means one more penny for the victims. Therefore, travel expenses can only be reduced according to the travel expense rules set by the Central Relief Commission and cannot be exceeded. (13) The procedures for disbursing funds must be complete to avoid objections from the Committee's audit team and accountants. (14) After departing, all staff members must report the progress of the relief efforts to the Committee at any time for assessment. (15) These rules will be implemented upon resolution by the Committee's standing committee.</p>

Ling Sifei sold paintings to Lin Pingsun and obtained 5 yuan, which was also included. (3) A letter from the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association stating that this amount is to be used for public funds. The association still needs to review it, so please postpone the use.</p>
<p>Large Batch of Disaster Victims from Mengcheng Arrives in Shanghai</p>
<p>Over 1,400 disaster victims from Mengcheng, Anhui, arrived in Nanjing by ship the day before yesterday. They set up tents on the open space in Xiaguan and stayed overnight. The next morning, they gathered and went to the Capital Flood Relief Association to request accommodation and relief. The association replied that it was currently in the process of dispersing refugees and that most of the shelters had already been closed. It was impossible to accommodate these disaster victims. Therefore, it sent personnel to negotiate with the Railway Bureau, which allocated ten cars. The Xiaguan Police Department dispatched police to escort them onto the cars and transport them to Shanghai. The Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau received a letter from the Capital Flood Relief Association stating that over 1,400 refugees from Mengcheng had been transported by train from Nanjing and were expected to arrive in Shanghai on the evening of the 29th. It requested that appropriate measures be taken to provide relief to these disaster victims. After receiving the letter, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau sent a letter to the Public Security Bureau, instructing the nearby police stations to take care of the refugees when they arrive in Shanghai. It also sent letters to various charitable organizations to seek relief.</p>
<p>Letter Requesting the National Government to Allocate Relief Clothing</p>
<p>Huang Chunzhou, director of the Clothing Relief Association at 207 West Mandel Road, Racecourse, sent a letter to the National Government Flood Relief Committee yesterday, stating: "The clothing collected by our association, in addition to being sent to the Shanghai branch of the China Relief Association and your committee to accommodate disaster victims, has recently sent 5,000 pieces to the Hunan Provincial Government and 1,000 pieces to the Chongde Relief Association. Due to the large number of clothing donated by various sectors, there are many piles, and there are also many letters and telegrams from various places requesting clothing. We have already replied separately, asking them to contact your committee directly. Therefore, we have prepared 6,000 pieces of new and old clothing, 8,000 pieces of single and lined clothing, and 300 quilts. Please send a letter and send someone to our association to pick them up so that they can be distributed as soon as possible to ward off the cold."</p>
<p>Gaoyou Native Place Association Requests Relief</p>
<p>Wang Hongzao and other chairmen and members of the Shanghai Gaoyou Native Place Association sent a telegram to the Executive Yuan, Supervisory Yuan, Second Huai River Commission, Ministry of Interior, and Jiangsu Provincial Government of the National Government, stating: "The people of our hometown have been wandering in the floods for two months. Gaoyou is the first to bear the brunt, and the suffering is even more severe. Day and night, we shout and appeal, hoping that the wise government of Jiangsu will provide disaster relief and prioritize water conservancy, followed by local rehabilitation. Water conservancy is essential, including blocking the breaches, building a large eastern embankment, and repairing the western embankment. None of these can be missing. If the embankment is not blocked, it is equivalent to not embanking. If it is blocked but not strong, it will definitely breach again. If the breaches are blocked and strong, but the eastern embankment is not repaired, there are many dangerous works. Moreover, the soil is loaded and the sub-embankment is widened, making it impossible to withstand the flood. If the western embankment is not built, the eastern embankment will lose its protection. Lake and river protection is impossible to prevent and can breach at any time. These are all mutually supportive and should be comprehensively designed to be completed by this autumn and next spring. We heard that Shen Baixian, the director of the Jiangsu Construction Department, recently went to Gaoyou to survey the works, stating that there are 27 breaches, 23 of which have been blocked. The remaining four largest breaches can be blocked in 20 days. The subsequent embankment work will be divided into two phases, one to be completed in the spring of next year and the other to be completed in the summer. The masses were shocked and told each other that the result of our running around and shouting for help from the government to block the breaches in two months is like this. It is better to ask to stop the work quickly to avoid wasting money and causing us survivors to flee further and avoid expanding disasters. Alas, heaven! National crisis is urgent, and man-made disasters are rampant. If Director Shen fulfills his promise, the counties east of the Jiangbei Canal will perish with it! Gaoyou will perish before the counties below the river! Is this tolerable? What is intolerable? Blocking breaches must emphasize搶堵搶er抢夺and斷流抢夺,堵而闭气and培筑坚实peitu solid. If the natural断流flow is already cut off, we should start with闭塞and还堤还堤, without堵而不闭du而不闭to徒事虚糜in vain and wasteful. This is a惯例usual practice, this is常识common sense. In the off-season when the water is shallow, repairing embankments is most suitable. Therefore, all unfinished projects in the spring should be completed before the桃汎peach flooding. Summer prevention is only for积土料preparing土料for抢险抢险. It has never been heard that伏汎fu flooding is approaching and still engaging in兴筑construction. This is also a惯例usual practice and also a常识common sense. Now, check the 23 breaches that have been blocked, all of which are 天断流natural flow and only 干疊包土dry叠包土, which is really 叹简省掷叹简省掷. Those who criticize it are惜之unfortunately. The未堵four places that have not been堵are 延复未延reverted and must wait for流断 or断time. 百万金钱泰百万金钱支, his intention will be to夸示in this way to the people of the country at that time,口堤responsibility尽 ,大功告成complete success 一指掩指天下天下掩 , his heart is very skillful, his plan is very careful. There is no堵而不闭 ,堵而不坚实du而不坚实失序失时险象毕露, do not think that the沿堤险工失修失修along the embankment,闸洞is everywhere危danger. Next year盛涨the flood will have十百倍十百倍of today's disasters. 三湖东迁抉目待三湖东迁抉目以. Even if Gaoyou does not want to亡perish. The more I think about it, the more I寒不寒不寒而栗. The more one thinks about it, the more shivers the shivering,文过沽名, 攘权夺利施之于寻常政务吾侪小民何敢置喙特运工非细事也，。If you see the常政务寻常政务, small民人何敢置喙to intervene in the matter. 淮扬生命财产 非小事淮扬生命财产,前车已覆 所伤前车已覆, damage is实多,积毁未销,又铸大错.祸首孙孙鸿哲.Even if the people of Jiangbei and Huaiyang are愚且懦 and懦. Jiangbei and Huaiyang are愚且懦 1, they must be努力救灾 to work together to save the people, and with the 造造灾群魔zuo死战 for a life and death. To sum it up, please pay attention to the current National Government and ask the wise men to listen to the people. We are all eager to protect the life and safety of the country. Now that we are in the time of need, we must seize the time and pay attention to the problems. Please also ask that the court pay attention to the number of deaths from the number of disasters in the country.</p>

<p>Zhao Doushi Case Redressed</p>
<p>Zhao Qilang from Haimen had an affair with the widow Zhao Doushi. Later, Zhao Doushi also had an affair with Kong Qingrong, who lived on Miezha Street. Zhao, driven by jealousy, colluded with his fellow villager Wang Cailang to lure Kong to the Xiaoshadu Railway and kill him. They cut off the deceased's genitals and threw them on the tracks, trying to make it look like a train accident to cover up their crime. However, the local court discovered the truth during the autopsy and ordered the arrest of the murderers. Unexpectedly, Zhao Doushi's son secretly informed the police station, which led to the cracking of the case. Zhao Qilang, Wang Cailang, and others were subsequently sent to the court. After the prosecutor filed a public prosecution, the criminal court judge summoned and interrogated them. Yesterday, Judge Qian announced the judgment, sentencing Zhao Qilang to life imprisonment and Wang Cailang to ten years in prison as a warning.</p>

<p>Injured Passengers to Sue for Damages</p>
<p>The express train from Beijing to Shanghai on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway recently collided with a freight train in Zhenru, causing many injuries, as reported in the newspapers. The Shanghai lawyer Chen Zhigao, who was returning to Shanghai from Suzhou on the train to attend a court session, was also seriously injured in the head and went to the German Hospital for treatment. The doctor advised him to rest for three weeks before he could recover. At the same time, the passengers believed that the railway bureau's staff were negligent, leading to frequent train accidents. This time, over twenty passengers were injured. Furthermore, the railway bureau had not taken any remedial measures for the injured, making future travel extremely dangerous. This incident was a major fault due to the railway bureau's improper personnel management. The passengers suffered damages as a result and the railway bureau should be fully responsible. The damages to lawyer Chen, who had a busy law practice, were particularly significant. The passengers requested lawyer Chen to file a lawsuit against the railway bureau for damages to ensure future safety. Many of the injured also went to lawyer Chen's office at 96 Beijing Road to discuss joint litigation.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Commendable Bravery of Shop Employee in Apprehending Thief <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Zhao Linfu, a 54-year-old man from Chaozhou, Guangdong, has been running the Sen Tai pawnshop at 40-42 Dongxinqiao Street (old address 145) in the French Concession for many years. The business has been doing well. After the reconstruction of the Baoyu Lane building opposite the shop, business has been booming. This attracted the attention of thieves. Yesterday morning at around 8:00 AM, as the shop was just opening and the employees were organizing the goods, an apprentice returned from fetching water. Unexpectedly, three thieves wearing short blue Yuan-style outfits, with one thief standing at the door as a lookout and two thieves holding guns, secretly followed the apprentice into the shop. They ordered the employees to remain silent and robbed cash and silver dollars from the drawers, totaling over 100 yuan. They left the shop and fled north. One of the shop employees, Zheng Guangyu, a 24-year-old man also from Chaozhou, was naturally alert. He saw the thieves leave the shop and secretly followed them. Zheng paid special attention to the thief in the short blue outfit who was holding the gun. When they reached Adora Road and turned west onto Xinxinqiao Street, then west along Caishi Street to the intersection of Mintiniyin Road and Jincheng Bank, the thief suddenly stopped, looked around nervously, as if waiting for someone. Seeing the opportunity, Zheng jumped on the thief from behind and grabbed him, shouting for help. Nearby detectives gathered and assisted in capturing the thief on the spot. They found a four-inch Browning pistol with eight bullets on the thief. They took him to the police station. After a detailed interrogation, the thief confessed that his name was Zhang Guiying, from Anhui, and that he was 36 years old. He admitted to colluding with others to commit robbery. He was immediately detained and will be sent to the court for severe punishment.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Appeal Case of Russian Man Ordering Military Supplies <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Bick Attacks Laifa</p>
<p>Claims Ties to Noulens</p>
<p>The Russian man, Krilich Bick-Ravinsky, previously impersonated a military advisor to the National Government and, along with Zhang Faying, who claimed to be a procurement commissioner of the National Government, ordered military supplies worth about two million yuan from the Laifa Foreign Company, owned by the Englishman Laifa on Guangdong Road. They also forged documents to defraud Zhu Ziyao of money. Laifa reported this to the police station, which sent Bick and Ravinsky to the First Special District Court. Each was sentenced to one year in prison, as reported in previous newspapers. However, Bick refused to accept the sentence and hired lawyer Qiu Fenling to file an appeal with the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Song Yuan and two assessors, Gao and Ye, held a trial in the first criminal court. The police station was represented by lawyers Ru Baoyi and Li Zhishan. First, Bick stated the reasons for his dissatisfaction with the original judgment, claiming that he had no involvement in the case and had never been to the Laifa Foreign Company. Ravinsky gave him a contract for the military supplies ordered by Laifa and asked him to report it to the customs. If the customs intercepted the military supplies, they would receive a reward of 25 yuan per gun. Bick also claimed that he never impersonated a military advisor and was framed. He attacked Laifa's behavior, claiming that Laifa's business was improper and that he had a close relationship with the communist leader Noulens. All of Noulens' military supplies passed through Laifa. Fearing that he would reveal their secrets, Laifa had him arrested one day after Noulens was arrested. The presiding judge noted that the appellant, Laifa, was not present today and that the witnesses had not been gathered, so he adjourned the trial to a later date.</p>

The thieves broke through the fence in the back and entered, stealing valuables worth over 1,000 yuan. They also killed Zhu's aunt-in-law, Gu Caoshi, and the maid, Zhou Lushi, with knives. Cai Zhitian, a Chinese detective from the Huishan Police Station, arrested the murderer, Ma A'er (who was his chauffeur), from Tongzhou, along with a knife. The First Special District Court interrogated them, as reported in previous newspapers. The case has now concluded and is awaiting sentencing. Yesterday morning, Judge Shen Bingrong held a trial in the third criminal court. The police station's lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, instructed the police to bring Ma A'er to court. Judge Shen announced the verdict, sentencing Ma A'er to death for the crime of burglary and intentional homicide. The murder weapon was confiscated.</p>

<p>Qin Shoufan, a butcher from Haimen who worked at Chen Xinji's pig slaughterhouse at 55 Yuezhou Road, had a wife named Zhang (32 years old). Zhang was promiscuous and had an affair with a fellow villager surnamed Fan at 50 Jiaxing Road on the 11th of this month. Qin found out and on the morning of the 19th, at 11:30 AM, he found Zhang and took her to his brother's place at 3248 Zhoujiazui Road. He asked Zhang to hand over 30 yuan for travel expenses, but she refused. Qin became enraged and used a</p>

The Harbin Police Station arrested Qin and sent him to the First Special District Court for interrogation. Yesterday morning, the police station sent Qin Shoufan to the third criminal court. Judge Shen Bingrong sentenced Qin Shoufan to 15 years in prison for the crime of murder. The number of days spent in custody before the judgment was finalized will be counted as one day of imprisonment for every two days.</p>
<h3 id="e157">City Chamber of Commerce Relief Meeting for Coal Shortage <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Organized jointly by the Chamber of Commerce, Shipping Industry, and Coal Industry</p>
<p>A committee is formed</p>
<p>Measures from various industrial and commercial groups</p>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce, in order to discuss the coal shortage problem, invited representatives from the Coal Industry and Shipping Industry Associations yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM for a joint meeting. Present were shipping representatives Zeng Guangqing, Min Xinwu, Chen Bogang, Yao Shumin, Ding Xijun, Chen Shuntong, Zhao Yunhe, and Chen Jisheng, and coal industry representatives Chen Qisheng, Mao Chunpu, Pan Yisan, Shen Jinzhou, Liu Hongsheng, and others. From the City Chamber of Commerce were Wang Xiaolai and Xu Jiying. Wang Xiaolai, as chairman, first presented the Coal Industry Association's letter stating that local coal reserves were low. Since the coal embargo after registration, the supply of national coal was urgently needed. However, due to the lack of additional vehicles and the shortage of state-owned shipping, a meeting was requested to express the urgent situation. Representatives from both industries were asked to attend and share their insights to avoid a coal shortage and to benefit the anti-Japanese effort. Representatives from both the coal and shipping industries then presented their opinions on the actual coal demand in Shanghai and the required number of ships. After detailed discussion, the shipping industry agreed to allocate its members' larger vessels for use. It was estimated that, in addition to the 120,000 tons already being shipped to Shanghai by hired vessels, the remaining shortfall could be transported by Chinese ships, ensuring no future coal shortage. Both parties were satisfied and immediately resolved to have the Chamber of Commerce, Shipping Industry, and Coal Industry each appoint three committee members to form a joint committee. It was decided that this committee would convene next Saturday at 3:00 PM at the Chamber to discuss further actions.</p>
<p>Two Telegrams from the City Chamber of Commerce. The City Chamber of Commerce and other groups yesterday sent two urgent telegrams regarding the coal shortage relief issue. The telegrams read: (1) To the Nanjing Executive Yuan, Premier and Minister of Industry Kong, Minister of Railways Lian, and Provincial Governor Han: Since the Jiaoji Railway announced a coal transportation price increase on November 1st, Shandong mine owners have resolved to strike on that day. We are aware that, in this small corner of the sea, Japanese coal is nearly exhausted, and Southern China relies on Northern mines for fuel. The Beipiao coal from Yingkou cannot be transported due to the Northern Ning Railway obstruction. The Jingxing and Datong coal from Tanggu cannot be heavily loaded due to the shallow winter waters. The Zhongxing coal from Jinpu is only for railway use, and the Liuhegou coal from Pinghan has been suspended for a long time. The only foreign coal available to Shanghai shippers and factories is Kailuan, and the only domestic coal is Boshan. If the Jiaoji Railway's mined coal is subject to a strike due to increased fees, the coal prices in the southern provinces will skyrocket, and industries will halt, which is not desired. Furthermore, the Ministry of Railways' reply to the Ministry of Industry stated that the Jiaoji and PingSui railways had special circumstances for coal transportation and that the Ministry would separately determine a reduced freight rate. The Qingji Railway Bureau cited the Xia Li reduced freight rate method, which was limited to the end of October and was therefore a separate case, not included in the Ministry of Railways' so-called reduction. This document was discussed but not implemented, greatly disappointing the coal merchants. Especially at this time of national crisis, when the people are refusing to use Japanese coal, the government should provide protection. Matters of state should be handled both according to principle and expediency, and legal matters can be amended. How can a case decided by the State Council not be subject to change? In the interest of national revenue and social stability, we are urgently telegramming Shandong mine owners to cancel the strike and urging you to order the Jiaoji Railway Bureau to temporarily retain the proposed price increase of November 1st. After the end of the war of resistance, you should convene railway bureaus and mine owners for a detailed meeting to ensure that national coal freight rates are equal and that the railway bureau's income is not reduced, the mine owners' burden is not increased, and the coal industry's future is benefited. We boldly submit these words for your consideration. Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce, etc. (2) To the Boshan Mine Owners United Association: The Jiaoji Railway Bureau plans to increase prices starting tomorrow, and your association has resolved to strike as a final appeal. We were extremely alarmed upon hearing this news. Shanghai's coal reserves are less than a month's worth. A halt to Shandong coal will open the door to foreign coal and block the development of domestic coal, harming social stability and the people's economy. We have jointly telegraphed the Executive Yuan, the Ministries of Industry and Railways, and Shandong Governor Han to order the Qingji Railway to temporarily retain the price increase and for the central government to convene railway bureaus and mine owners for a detailed discussion to ensure that national revenue and mine owners' burdens are both considered and balanced. In addition to sending separate telegrams, we urge you not to strike before receiving the government's final order to avoid a coal shortage. This is our sincere request. Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce, etc.</p>
<p>Meetings of Various Groups. During this Northeast Incident, Shanghai coal merchants unanimously resolved to stop handling Japanese coal and to stabilize coal prices. Although there have been many boycotts of Japanese goods, Japanese coal has never been included. This is truly the first righteous act. Unexpectedly, at this time of promoting domestic coal, the Jiaoji Railway suddenly increased freight rates. Shandong is a coal-producing region, and it is a major source of coal for Shanghai. Now, the Jiaoji Railway, disregarding business principles, arbitrarily increases prices, not only undermining the promotion of domestic coal and harming the Chinese people, but also affecting the work of Shanghai factories and hindering the boycott of Japanese goods. The Shandong Zichuan Weifang Mining and Coal Industry United Association specially sent representatives Li Mianmo and Yang Suwu to request assistance from all sectors of Shanghai. The night before, the Chairman of the City Chamber of Commerce, Wang Xiaolai, invited Shanghai industrial figures Xie Hengchuang, Shi Liangcai, Yu Qiaqing, Nie Lusheng, Wang Yansong, Yuan Lvdeng, Hong Yanzu, Guo Waifeng, and others to discuss rescue measures at a Yizhi Lou restaurant. A unanimous decision was reached to have the industrial and shipping groups telegram the government to fight for their rights. The summary of Li and Yang's remarks is excerpted below: Respectfully, we have learned that since the Jiaoji Railway increased coal freight rates by 20% last year, more than 100,000 tons of foreign coal has been dumped into Shandong Province. (Shandong Province was originally a coal-producing region and had no foreign coal imports. This phenomenon only occurred after the freight increase.) Exports to various ports in South China have also sharply decreased. Shandong coal merchants, seeing this dangerous situation, have repeatedly appealed for freight reductions to achieve equal treatment with other railways, but have not been granted. In May of this year, the railway suddenly announced another 20% increase. Coal merchants, already severely squeezed by the high prices, found it impossible to bear another increase and were forced to shut down. Fortunately, the government did not approve of this action, and the Jiaoji Railway voluntarily canceled the increase. Unexpectedly, on the 3rd of this month, the railway issued another notice that it would resume the 20% increase on November 1st. Upon hearing this, we were greatly alarmed. The only reason the Jiaoji Railway cited for the price increase was that, with the current boycott of Japanese coal, there would inevitably be a shortage of domestic coal, making the price increase harmless. However, at this time of national crisis, Shanghai coal merchants have discussed and unanimously boycotted Japanese coal and do not raise prices to maintain the economic stability of society. Therefore, how can the Jiaoji Railway's freight increase be said to be harmless? Merchants still know how to love their country and have this proposition. The Jiaoji Railway, as a state-run enterprise, is taking advantage of the national crisis for profit, deliberately obliterating all facts and interests and acting arbitrarily. We do not know what their intentions are. Moreover, the current coal shortage is temporary, while the price increase will be permanent, and it cannot be justified. The reason is very clear. Therefore, Shandong coal merchants are extremely indignant about the Jiaoji Railway's actions. In the past, the Jiaoji Railway's freight increase was managed by the Traffic Department. The head of the railway's Traffic Department was originally Japanese.</p>
<p>He aimed to prevent Shandong coal from being transported to South China, to cause a coal shortage in Shanghai, and to prevent us from insisting on the boycott, to maintain the sales market of Japanese coal in Shanghai. The plan was extremely vicious. However, according to the railway's organizational law, if the Chinese Deputy Director did not agree, his proposal could be rejected. But Deputy Director Tan was servile to the Japanese and disregarded the national crisis and commercial reports, rashly assisting in his plan. Tracing the source of the disaster, Deputy Director Tan cannot shirk his responsibility. The mine owners believe that if the Jiaoji Railway does not cancel the price increase, Shandong coal merchants will inevitably be forced to cease operations. To avoid further losses, they will have to temporarily suspend operations. However, for Shanghai, the sources of coal are Japan, Qinhuangdao, Qingdao, Tanggu, and other places. Now that Japanese coal is being boycotted, the sources have become insufficient. If Shandong coal merchants suspend operations, the source from Qingdao will be cut off, and a coal shortage in Shanghai can be predicted. The only solution is to have the Jiaoji Railway withdraw the price increase, so that merchants can be at peace. But no matter how much we explain, the railway stubbornly adheres to its decision. Therefore, our association has sent representatives south to present the situation to the government and related parties, requesting assistance to have the Jiaoji Railway cancel the price increase as soon as possible to avoid a strike and to alleviate the danger of a coal shortage in Shanghai. The Shanghai fuel problem is of great importance and has always been a concern to you all. In the past, various groups have petitioned the central government and the Shandong provincial government to cancel the price increase. Now, with the implementation of the price increase on November 10th approaching, we have not yet received a clear reply from the central government. The crisis is imminent. We urge you to discuss further assistance measures to maintain the situation. Not only will our association be eternally grateful, but the citizens of Shanghai will also benefit. October 28th, 20th year of the Republic of China,</p>
<p>Telegram from the Ministry of Railways. The National Coal Production and Sales Association received a telegram from the Ministry of Railways yesterday, which stated: To the Shanghai Chinese National Coal Production and Sales Association: We have received and understood your telegram regarding the soaring coal prices and the doubling of railway costs, which have made it nearly impossible to sustain operations. The Ministry has formulated relief measures and submitted them to the National Government for approval. Passenger and freight rates on all railways have been increased separately, effective May 1st of this year. The Jiaoji Railway originally planned to increase freight rates by 20%, but after repeated requests for reduction from various coal merchants, and in view of the fact that there was no issue with the price increase for domestic sales, but exports would soon be increased, and that other railways only increased by 10% or 15%, the Ministry, to show special consideration for domestic coal merchants, changed the plan and submitted it to the government for approval. The Jiaoji Railway was allowed to follow the original summer discount of 20% to offset the new price increase. It was also stated that a fair freight rate would be determined after the summer. At that time, all coal merchants expressed their compliance. During this summer discount period, the Ministry sent personnel to investigate and fully understood the high cost of coal along the railway line, which was due to (1) poor management by the mines themselves, (2) extremely high light railway freight rates, (3) Qingdao port fees, and (4) excessive shipping costs. The Jiaoji Railway's freight rate was low and could not be compared with the above factors. It could not affect coal sales. The railway bureau pointed this out to the coal merchants one by one, and the merchants had no words to defend themselves. Therefore, a compromise was reached, setting a special price of 2.8 yuan for exports, which was approximately 15% above the old price, and for domestic sales, the price was increased by 20%, as expressed by the merchants before the summer discount. This fair special price was thoroughly discussed by the Ministry and the railway before it was agreed upon. The summer discount period was also extended by one month. It can be said that the protection of domestic coal was meticulous. Currently, various coal merchants, to achieve their own selfish interests, do not hesitate to use the opportunity to exaggerate their claims and deceive the public. Some have even published articles pointing out that there are Japanese directors in various railways who are trying to undermine patriotic movements, which is completely contrary to the facts. We do not know what their intentions are. This case was initiated before May of this year. After repeated changes, a fair special price was finally determined and implemented in November, while the boycott of foreign coal only occurred after September. It can be seen that it is completely unrelated to this case. The coal merchants are only using this as a means to deceive society. Upon further review, the truth will become clear. The Ministry believes that whether domestic coal can be sold well depends primarily on whether the coal mines can produce in large quantities and secondarily on whether the railways have sufficient vehicles. Whether the freight rate is increased or not is only a matter of how much profit domestic coal can make at the current high price, and it is by no means a question of whether it can be transported to supply the market. Railway vehicles are in short supply, and military transportation is frequent, making it very difficult to allocate vehicles. Although some coal merchants with a deep understanding of righteousness plan to purchase vehicles themselves or advance funds to repair vehicles, we fear that this will be too slow to alleviate the urgent situation. If the coal merchants continue to make things difficult for the railways, it will be no different from cutting off their own business. We urge you to inform your fellow coal merchants that at this time, it is appropriate to work together to maintain the situation and seek a way out. Please do not put private interests first and disregard the overall situation. We sincerely hope so. Special reply, Ministry of Railways.</p>

<p>Denies representing Deputy Zhang in all matters</p>
<p>Zhang Shizhao arrived in Shanghai from Beijing the day before yesterday, without stopping over in Jing. Zhang's arrival is to practice law. According to reports, the earlier claims in various newspapers about representing Deputy Zhang in all matters were not true. He also said that he had grown weary of political life in recent years and intends to devote himself to serving society and to engage in writing in his spare time.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Appeal of Case Involving Death of Chinese Constable from Assault <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Two constables on duty are accused of joint assault</p>
<p>Chen Taishan, from Huaian, Jiangbei, along with his uncle Chen Naiqing and his aunt Luo Chen, previously filed a lawsuit in the Second Special Court stating that their nephew Taishan was serving as Chinese constable number 632 at the Beidang Road Police Station. On the evening of September 11th of this year, after finishing his shift at 9:00 PM, he went to the Great World with four other Chinese constables, Xu Lijin (662), Hong Jiacan (607), Huang Xinchun (488), and Peng Chaoshan (493), for entertainment. They left at 11:00 PM and headed east along Avenue Edward VII. Upon reaching the entrance of Baoyu Lane, they saw a gambling stall set up by a certain Jia. Taishan went forward to gamble, leading to a quarrel with the stall owner, Jia. He was then attacked by a group of people. Xu Lijin and others helped restrain three of the assailants and handed them over to Chinese constables Yang Wende (450) and Wu Yuanyi (503) on duty at the Great Bell Police Station. Unexpectedly, Yang and Wu not only did not take the assailants to the police station but also released them and gathered twenty or thirty ruffians to attack Taishan and others, causing injury to his abdomen. He was taken to the police hospital for treatment but died on the 14th due to his injuries. Under such circumstances, the defendants Yang Wende and Wu Yuanyi are guilty of joint assault. They requested justice. After repeated summons by the court, the defendants were found not guilty. Chen Naiqing and others, dissatisfied with the first instance verdict, appealed to the Higher Third Branch Court, which was approved. Yesterday, both parties and witnesses were summoned for an investigative hearing at 2:00 PM, presided over by Criminal Division Chief Guo Dezhang, along with judges Zhang Chaozuo and Li Changnian, and prosecutor Zhang Zongkan. First, the appellant Chen Dingqing recounted the previous events and stated that his nephew was tragically killed and requested justice. Then, the four Chinese constables, Xu Lijin (662), Hong Jiacan (607), Huang Xinchun (488), and Peng Chaoshan (493), testified that on the evening of September 11th, after finishing their shift at 9:00 PM, they went to the Great World with the deceased Chen Taishan. They left after 11:00 PM and, upon reaching the entrance of Baoyu Lane, Taishan gambled at a stall, leading to a quarrel and assault with the stall owner. The civilians helped restrain three of the assailants and handed them over to constables Yang Wende (450) and Wu Yuanyi (503) on duty. Unexpectedly, the two constables released them and then gathered a crowd to attack Chen Taishan, resulting in his death. This is the truth. The official asked if the police station's report, which stated that the incident occurred because the constables demanded tips from the gambling stall, was true. Xu and others replied that it was not. The two constables, Yang Wende and Wu Yuanyi, testified that on that evening, they were on duty in that area and heard reports of a fight at the entrance of Baoyu Lane. When they arrived, patrolman number 662 said, "We are also patrolmen and can take them to the police station ourselves." There was never a case of handing over the assailants to them to take to the police station. They asked for investigation. Chief Judge Guo reviewed the testimonies and dismissed them to await further investigation at a later date.</p>

<p>The Xinming Cigarette and Paper Store at 450 Avenue Joffre in the French Concession was established by Cao Haisong many years ago. After Haisong's death in the 16th year, the store was managed by his wife, Cao Liu, and his son, Genquan. Suddenly, a certain Xu Baosheng coveted the store's location and previously hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the former French Concession Mixed Court, claiming that the store belonged to him and was not Cao's property. After investigation by the former Mixed Court, Xu Baosheng's claim was rejected. Xu Baosheng, dissatisfied with the first instance verdict, appealed to the Second Special District Local Court. Cao Liu hired lawyer Xu Yannan to defend. After arguments from both lawyers at a hearing a few days ago, the verdict was announced yesterday, rejecting the appeal.</p>

<p>Yesterday's newspaper reported that six students from Modern Middle School, including Peng Jun and Li Youmin, were arrested by Japanese marines while speaking on Tokyo Road the night before and had not been released as of late at night. According to an investigation by the Public Security Bureau, the six students were speaking at 6:30 PM the night before when they were disturbed by Japanese workers from the Naigaimen Japanese textile factory. The local police station sent Chinese and foreign detectives to the scene, who mistakenly arrested the six students and took them to the police station. After clarifying the truth, they were released within fifteen minutes. The arrester of Peng and the others was not a Japanese marine.</p>

<p>Yesterday at 9:00 AM, the First District Local Court of the Special Court heard a case of violation of the Stamp Duty Regulations. Defendants Shuangwanmao Cigarette Factory in Wufulin Lane, Hongxinghao in Sanyangjing Bridge, Juchangxiang Zhenji in Shilu, Laohongyuan Shoe and Hat Store in Shujinli, China Underwear Company on Nanjing Road, Tongsanmei Wine Shop on Zhejiang Road, Hengchang Dyeing Factory in Bentang Lane Bridge North, and Yufengtai Wine Shop on Fourth Avenue were all penalized 15 yuan each by Judge Shen Shanzhen for not affixing stamp duty on invoices. Dachangxing Hardware Store at 17 Xihua Road Wuchang Road Angle was also penalized 150 yuan. Because they had been fined twice before for not complying with the stamp duty regulations and this time used disguised invoice paper with intent to evade national taxes, the penalty was increased. Dayi Hardware Store at 103 Bailaohui Road Tain Road intersection was fined 220 yuan for failing to affix stamp duty to 22 account books, after being reported by someone. The Stamp Duty Office of the Special District sent personnel and police officers with a search warrant to investigate and seize the case. Judge Shen ordered them to be fined 10 to 100 yuan per item according to the regulations. Considering that it was their first offense, the fine was reduced to 220 yuan to show a warning.</p>

<h3 id="e170">How Can We Brew a Practical and Effective Method to Boycott Japanese Goods? Liu Boyong <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>(Establish Japanese goods exhibition centers, appoint promoters, and hold oath-taking ceremonies in various places)</p>
<p>(1) Establish Japanese goods exhibition centers in various cities, towns, and villages. At this time, the national movement to boycott Japanese goods is heating up. There have been many inspections and seizures of Japanese goods. The general association should collect various Japanese goods and let various groups organize Japanese goods exhibition centers, planning permanent management methods. The location of the exhibition should be appropriate (in cities, such as parks or public places, such as popular temples), and the layout should be elegant. The annual sales volume of each item should be noted to allow the public to understand, so that everyone can distinguish and have feelings. Otherwise, even though people talk about boycotting Japanese goods, if you ask a passerby, "What is Japanese goods?" they will stare blankly and be unable to answer. How can they boycott it? (2) Promotion. (A) Annual promotion. After the above-mentioned Japanese goods exhibition center is established, it is necessary to hold a grand promotion ceremony, inviting all nearby residents to attend. Major promotional meetings should also be held on every national humiliation memorial day. (B) Long-term promotion. Each county should send one or two promoters to be responsible for long-term promotion of boycotting Japanese goods and promoting domestic goods. They must have the spirit of missionaries, persuading and converting people along the way. The promoters should wear hats with domestic goods trademarks and long clothes with domestic goods trademarks, holding small pamphlets with domestic goods trademarks. People with patriotic enthusiasm and willingness to serve society should be appointed, without being shy. Look at how Gandhi himself took a spinning wheel to the British palace. Domestic domestic goods factories can save their annual advertising expenses and use it as long-term promotional expenses. I am afraid it is much more effective than pasting silent slogans on wooden signs or walls. (3) Oath-taking. In major commercial ports, where anti-Japanese associations are organized, merchants should be gathered to take an oath in front of the people to never buy enemy goods. The ceremony should be very solemn and the oath should be strict.</p>

<p>To the esteemed editor, in the local news column of your newspaper on the 28th of this month, a letter from Song Chongjiu was published, requesting that "the statement in your newspaper's local news section, regarding the list of Shanghai university professors expressing their opinions, be corrected, as the name Zhu Tongjiu is erroneous and should be Song Chongjiu," etc. According to our records, Tongjiu did indeed sign the opinion letter from Shanghai universities at 8:30 AM on the 24th of this month in the faculty lounge of Fudan University without any mistake. It was Zhu Tongjiu, not Song Chongjiu. We hereby make this statement and request a correction. Respectfully, Zhu Tong, Professor of Economics, National Jinan University. October 29th.</p>

<h3 id="e174">Two Recent Female Poets in German Literary Circles <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— Mo Jing</p>
<p>Among the contemporary young female poets in Germany, Ruth Schaumann and Elisabeth Motschmann can be considered to have secured a firm position in the literary world. The former gained general recognition some years ago, and now any anthology of contemporary German lyrical poetry is bound to include her work. The latter, a younger woman of twenty-three, has won the praise of such renowned German critics as Ernst Robert Curtius. Indeed, since his critique of her work, published about a year ago in the Berlin literary review, she can be considered "famous."</p>
<p>Ruth Schaumann is a most interesting personality. Born in Hamburg in 1899, she spent her early girlhood there, then went to Munich to study art, where she received very favorable local criticism for her sculpture. She later devoted herself to sculpture as a lifelong career. This is noteworthy because, six years ago, the critic who discussed her poetry as "sculptural lyric poetry" used many proofs to show the relationship between the two art forms to which she dedicated her life. Ruth Schaumann's first collection of poems was published in 1920, called "Die Kirche" (The Church). Reading this collection, we can say that this poet is a Catholic. Her religious and philosophical background almost uniformly permeates her work. Four years later, a dramatic poem called "Die Glashergkinder" (The Glassworks Children) appeared, along with another collection of lyrical poems called "Erde Keimende" (Germinating Earth). In 1926, another lyrical collection, "Das Buch der Hingabe" (The Book of Devotion), was published, gaining general recognition. At the same time, Ruth Schaumann also published short stories and articles on art. She has also produced works in other art forms; several of her best colored woodcuts decorate her recent collection of poems, "Was Wahr Ist" (What is True). She has also adorned "Das Buch der Hingabe" with drawings that have earned as much praise as the poems themselves.</p>
<p>Anyone who examines Ruth Schaumann's entire body of work can see that her work demonstrates a distinct evolution from the passionate abundance of "Erde Keimende" to the subtle seriousness of "Das Buch der Hingabe." Her book "Was Wahr Ist" is a simple display of the mystery of ordinary things—the human body seems to be merely an instrument of spiritual life, and human associations are expressed in simple, moving poems. The entire collection is a pure joy for those who have not strayed far from fundamental reality.</p>
<p>Elisabeth Motschmann, in any case, is not a "realist." She also insists on simple, important realities: love, health, the morning breath, and the ecstasy of spring. Some of her best poems are love poems, belonging to a kind of virginal passion. They are dedicated to the poet's beloved, and their purity and sincerity are beyond doubt. This collection also includes an excellent translation of Victor Hugo's "Booz Endormi" (Booz Asleep), whose idyllic beauty is perfectly in harmony with the poet's temperament, even when she sometimes wants to soar to a passionate rhetorical tone.</p>
<p>Readers of contemporary German poetry will eagerly await the publication of Elisabeth Motschmann's second collection of lyrical poems, for her first book, "Dank Des Lebens" (Thanks to Life), already foreshadows a Promise.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Death of French Sculptor Bourdelle <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— De Ming</p>
<p>The modern French sculpture scene is shaped by a three-legged cauldron. Those three legs are: three great sculptors—Despiau (whose life and art the reporter introduced in an article published in the January issue of this journal), Maillol, and Bourdelle (Joseph Bourdelle). Now that we have heard of Bourdelle's death, this is not only a major loss to the French art world, but also to the art world worldwide. In mourning, I will briefly describe Bourdelle's life and art below.</p>
<p>Bourdelle was born in 1866 in Vienne (not Vienna, the capital of Austria; this is a county in France; readers should not misunderstand). His birthplace is located on the Rhone River, where the river winds and the mountains are intertwined, a suitable environment for nurturing the vitality of a imaginative young man. From a very young age, Bourdelle was able to carve figures of people, birds, and animals on wood. At the age of eleven, he went on to carve stone, sculpting a pair of lions and placing them in his father's garden. It can be said that his career as a sculptor began at that time. Later, he received funding from the Vienne municipal government and entered the Lyon School of Fine Arts to study sculpture. At the age of nineteen, he transferred to the National School of Fine Arts. Shortly after entering the academy, he discovered the errors in the teaching methods of the academy's teachers. Therefore, he did not follow those erroneous and outdated conventions, but took the model as his only paradigm and created faithfully. He knew that drawing was the best way to practice his skills, so he diligently practiced drawing every night, and as a result, his skills became very proficient. He did not need to make a plaster model before sculpting, but directly carved stone, with no fear of making mistakes. (Ordinary sculptors usually make a plaster model first and then carve it in stone, because they have not practiced drawing or their practice is not refined, and their skills are not smooth. Directly carving stone is feared to cause errors, so they often do not dare to try it easily.) His sculpture was simply drawing on stone, with freehand strokes that were always satisfactory. From the success of Bourdelle's art, art students can learn a very good lesson, which is that art—whether sculpture or painting—cannot succeed without focusing on drawing, because drawing is the foundation of art. Without a good and solid foundation, it is difficult to hope for artistic success.</p>
<p>Bourdelle's works can be divided into two main categories: reliefs and statues.</p>
<p>His reliefs are decorative idealist works, with a style reminiscent of ancient Greek sculpture.</p>
<p>His statues, however, are different from his reliefs and are naturalist works. His naturalism is thorough. In the works of any past or present sculptor, we cannot see such a thorough naturalistic style as Bourdelle's. His naturalistic works are entirely creative and do not borrow anything from others. His reliefs, as mentioned in the previous paragraph, are somewhat influenced by Greek sculpture.</p>
<p>Bourdelle's sculpture focuses on form (Picasso). This is different from Despiau's focus on character expression and Maillol's focus on physical expression. Character expression and physical expression have been noted by previous artists, but the issue of form has only recently begun to be noticed (such as the painting of Picasso, the leader of the modern art world, also focuses on form). Therefore, Bourdelle is an extremely ultramodern artist.</p>
<p>Several years ago, the French government awarded Bourdelle the Legion of Honor for his outstanding art.</p>

<h3 id="e176">Withdrawal from School <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— Ichiro</p>
<p>Originally studying at University B in Xujiahui, she, who was adored by many, transferred to a university in Hongkou because she disliked University B's mechanical curriculum. This news was, of course, welcomed by the male students at the Hongkou University.</p>
<p>She had an oval face and wore hair like black snakes. Her hobbies were eating chocolate, drinking coffee, and drinking milk. Besides eating, she liked to play tennis and basketball. As for her personality, of course, she was lively and exquisite.</p>
<p>Since entering the Hongkou University, she felt a sense of joy in her heart. She further developed her lively genius. Besides perfunctorily attending some classes, she played basketball and tennis on the playground.</p>
<p>Human personalities mostly change with the environment. She is now even more lively. Because of her lively characteristics, many male students, besides adoring her, very much wanted to pursue her.</p>
<p>○　○　○</p>
<p>One day, it was a time when autumn was swaying, she followed the school bell and stepped into the classroom.</p>
<p>She walked slowly forward. Unconsciously, in front of the classroom, she stepped on the foot of an athlete named Zhang. This action, in her eyes, was truly unconscious, but the manifestation of this action caused the students in the entire class to laugh and become noisy.</p>
<p>"She really is an unconscious woman, too romantic."</p>
<p>"That's for sure, I think she will be expelled by the university authorities."</p>
<p>"At least that's the case. You can tell from her irregular attitude."</p>
<p>"Besides playing ball and drinking milk, it seems that she has nothing else to do."</p>
<p>"She is a bored woman."</p>
<p>The male students in the entire class were mocking her like this. They felt an extraordinary interest in this kind of mockery. If the "meaning of life" is built on interest, then this interesting mockery is their ideal "meaning of life."</p>
<p>She hated their attitude very much. She thought this behavior was cruel. She became tired of school life. At the same time, she could not think of any interest in books.</p>
<p>She went to the principal's office crying. She said that because of special family circumstances, she requested to withdraw from school.</p>
<p>The principal did not object to her opinion, because he thought that children's schooling required the consent of the family.</p>
<p>○　○　○</p>
<p>She, who had been at University B for less than a month, now voluntarily withdrew from school again.</p>
<p>The male students at University B were repenting of their own actions.</p>
