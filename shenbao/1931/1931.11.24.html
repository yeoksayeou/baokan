<p>昨秘密會經過一度修正</p>
<p>（巴黎）　今晨十時五十分國聯行政會開會　考慮關於國聯遣派調查委員團赴滿之决議案草案、該决議案由中日兩國贊成、始能發生效力、現兩國對於該問題之意見、大相歧異、故衆認欲擬定雙方均可同意之决議案、其事非常艱難、昨日國聯秘書長德魯蒙助以國聯專家、終日從事此項工作、聞草案將令委員團不稍含干涉爭端之實在權力、且使滿洲撤兵問題與委員團之遣派為兩事、庶撤兵事不因委員團之任命、或委員團之行動、受有影響、今晨行政會同意於决議案已確切根據日本之提議、而契合行政會關於該問題之意見後、即於午後十二時十分散會、提出該决議案之公開會議日期、尚未决定、蓋先須保證該案之可行一致通過也、如該案不能一致通過、即該案不能獲中日兩國之贊同、則行政會必須紀錄對於此舉不能商得同意、今晨之會議、中日代表均未出席、草决議案將於今日午後交中日政府、明晨十一時、行政會將再舉行非公開會議、（二十三日路透社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　今晨行政會開會考慮德魯蒙所草擬遣派調查委員團赴滿之决議案時、對於該案、曾大加修正、現將由白里安分致芳澤與施肇基博士、行政會希望明晨會議可最後通過該案、聞關於撤兵案之通過、多少將根據九月三十日行政會之决議案、至於調查委員團除調查滿洲外、兼及中國各省問題、聞决議案中將混而言之、不提出滿洲或中國字樣、該委員團之權力、甚為廣大、庶可充分調查關於中日爭端之各事、（二十三日路透社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　行政會已定明晨十時重行集議、今晨法扡對於遣派委員團調查一切之計劃、有顯著之樂觀、惟謂前途荆棘正多、一切尚不能預决、衆意行政會會務、本星期杪可望結束（二十二日國民社電）</p>

<p>撤兵問題無滿意解决</p>
<p>調查團計劃决難接受</p>
<p>日政府致芳澤新訓令</p>
<p>提示抽查範圍與權力</p>
<p>（巴黎）　星期六之理事會公開會議、我國代表力拒無關撤兵之調查委員團計劃、形成僵局、因此會議時未能有何動作、現中國代表團正向各方面力爭國聯會員國應有之合法權利、欲使撤兵問題獲一解决、國聯總秘書德魯蒙雖已命國聯起草委員會、在白里安監督之下草擬關於調查委員團之决議案、但聞白里安之意、此項决議案非經私人接洽獲得一致同意後、不能提出公開會議、因此理事會各領袖今日夜以繼日、紛紛商議接洽、甚為忙碌、然觀於中國之反對與日本之倔强態度、已有人認此事仍恐未必有解决之可能也、今日芳澤松平曾與西門相晤、施肇基與道威斯白里安相晤、聞日代表又接本國政府關於調查團計劃進行之新訓令、其他理事則鑒於理事會內僵局依然、正紛紛向本國政府請訓、（二十二日國民社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　中國總代表施肇基博士今日向往訪之美聯社記者宣稱、渠不容國聯理事會閃避中國要求之立即撤兵問題、施氏今午曾與美大使道威斯相晤、惟其談話是否與此有關、施氏不欲表示、第向美聯社記者聲稱、中國未嘗改變其地位、亦未改其代表團在星期六大會中之宣言、凡任何計劃欲延緩撤兵之藉口者、决不能接受、中國固將贊成調查委員團提議、但必俟理事會解决撤兵問題之後云、（二十二日國民社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　此間外交界今日因滿州事、頗形活動、施博士見道威斯、而英外相西門於接見松平後、又延見道威斯與國聯秘書長德魯蒙、今晚六時芳澤訪白里安、詳陳日本提議派中立國人赴滿洲調查之細則、芳澤已接到東京關於日本此項提議之訓令、故向白里安詳告日政府之立塲、並聲明為注重此提案之彈性起見、渠不欲提出書面備忘錄、日本建議委員團以三人組成之、一為法國代表、以示尊重行政會議長白里安之意、一為英國代表、因英國以無偏袒著聞、且在遠東有重大關係也、一為美國代表以美國乃世界最大之國、且亦有大利益關係於滿洲也、據芳澤之意、此三國之代表、可擔保公正、中日代表亦可加入、而此調查團當然須有秘書與譯員、芳澤不限定委員額數三人或五人、但以為人數甚少之委員團較為便利、易於實行、且辦事可較迅速、芳澤且主張委員團應在中國本部及滿洲舉行調查、應研究引起目前危局之一般情勢、中國之不履行中日條約下義務、中國之排斥日人利益、及中日兩國間其他千百種之困難、日政府建議、委員團應先往中國、大約芳澤且將堅持此㸃、日政府之提議、重伸芳澤昨日所言之保留條件、即委員團不得干涉中日直接談判、且不得監視日軍行動、第二項之保留、可以使日本有隨其意思採行防衛計畫或酌量撤兵以應事態需要之完全自由也、芳澤今晚又　　四全代會昨日閉幕發表宣言·國府令顧維鈞代理外交部長·國聯派遣調查團决議草案討論就緒·日軍在新民巨流河一帶積極布防·（見國內要電）銀行公會討論金融公債問題·（見本埠新聞）</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>稱、渠接電報、證實日軍已開始撤回云、此間衆意、英外相西門為英國法學界之泰斗、殆將擔任草擬國聯委員團規程之工作、今日國聯秘書處公佈其所接中代表來文兩件、一報告日本飛機在海倫轟滅馬占山兵三千事、並謂日軍擬深入克山、而攻擊熱河北境、一報告滿洲境內其他軍事要地為日軍佔據事、但未言其詳、（二十二日路透社電）</p>
<p>（東京）　日政府今日又發出訓令致芳澤、未宣佈其內容、惟謂與調查團範圍權力之細則有關、日人謂行政會會員除中代表外、皆承認日本所稱不能依允完全停止敵對行為與立即撤兵各種理由之正當、如行政會不能勸令中國放棄其所要求停戰與撤兵兩點、恐調查團之計畫終成畫餅、而行政會亦唯有再聲明其九月三十日之議案、而再發表宣言請中日勿再有增重時局之行為、日人認此種新宣言為必要、庶可阻止錦州附近有起大衝突之可能、（二十三日路透社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　各代表團極其努力、中日兩國代表團之外、法美英三國代表亦甚活動、觀其情形、此五國代表宛似組有分委員會者然、道威斯西門德魯蒙各與施肇基談話、德魯蒙曾與西門談話甚久、關於日本提案之報告書、當由西門擔任起草、德魯蒙並與白里安晤談、午後六時三十分白氏接見芳澤、當將討論中各要點會同加以斟酌、松平亦甚活動、曾與道威斯諸人會晤、談話結果如何、各方均守緘默、但重大困難、所在有之、而行政院欲與解除、自必大費周章、當局者對於此層并不諱言、（二十二日哈瓦斯社電）</p>

<p>（莫斯科）　今晨蘇俄半官機關之伊斯威斯的亞報、亦痛斥國聯派遣調查團之議、謂日本絕無撤兵意思、國聯亦確不欲驅逐日本於其非法佔據之鄰邦境土以外、是國聯已完全屈服於日本、今乃提議派遣特別委員團、而授以類同埋首研究學術機關之職權、即對於日軍撤回一層、亦已不復提及、足見此時帝國主義者間、茍非自相殘殺、不能反對日本、故今日此輩國家所注意者、不過索取容許日本在華伸張勢力之回償而已、日本帝國主義者則安然從事其工作、鞏固其地位、旣不畏國聯之干涉、亦不懼其他帝國主義者之阻撓、同時中國則已被軍閥剝削至極端窮困地位、此種發展易於燃着中國民衆之革命火線、促其抵抗侵略者而引起最嚴重之結果、故今日遠東時局、大有一觸即發之勢、加以日本軍人不顧其政府意志與外交人員之宣言、一意專斷橫行、益增局勢之嚴重、蘇俄將審愼注意日本將士之挑撥政策、惟若輩之攫奮滿洲、將為一可怖危險舉動、僅目光淺短之武人始能為之、若輩已忘中國人民對日本民衆之巨大抵抗力、總之帝國主義者在遠東用大砲政策、行將燃及彼自行埋藏之火藥庫云、（二十三日國民社電）</p>

<h3 id="c16">以公理殉橫暴抑持公理衛和平 <a href="#c16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>國聯自三次集會以來。態度顯呈突變。其屈服於旣成事實。低首下心。左袒日本而壓抑中國。蓋為世界人士所共見。吾人固可以體解國聯為欲息事寗人。彌縫和平裂痕。而不惜屈服。并犧牲中國。甚且以公理殉橫暴。但犧牲公理以求茍安。則非吾人所敢茍同。而不得不指明此一觀念之重大錯誤。</p>
<p>九一八以來。日本所加諸我國之一切暴行。雖三尺孩提。應亦知其為破壞和平。為背棄盟約。為違所公理。以一種猛烈之軍事行動。侵略中國領土。至二倍已國之土地。公然在鄰國領土之內易幟設衙。同時并極力擴大其軍事行動。而猶謖為自衛。謂為非戰爭的行動。謂為不違背國聯盟約與非戰公約之精神。世界人士。應都立即可以瞭然於此種聲辯為極橫蠻之狡辯。絕不足以掩蔽事實之眞相。事實旣如此彰彰屹立於吾人之前。則國聯如欲處置此問題。排解此糾紛。只須基於公理正義之立場。持維護和平之精神依據盟約。作嚴正之判斷。此蓋亦為鐵一般的不可移易之原則。</p>
<p>國聯今日屈就日本。壓抑中國。使强者可以滿其慾求。使弱者含寃吞聲。謂為彌縫和平之裂痕。謀獲茍安之局面。固近似矣。但吾人認為和平之前提。必為公理。即和平必基於公理。乃得有保障。不合乎公理之茍安局面。不過為公理之屈服。為戰爭之彌縫。加緊未來戰爭之準備與醖釀而已。此種茍安。實為毫無意義。毫無價値。基結果益足以使公理正義被湮沒於醜惡污辱之深淵。</p>
<p>致和平之法。原有二道。一為不惜任何犧牲以致和平。但使可以致假和平。最後雖犧牲公理。亦所不惜。另一則為以公理衛和平。使和平必合乎公理前者為彌縫。為敷衍為茍安。而後者乃為眞正之和平。乃為足以博取人類謳歌。予人類以幸福之永久和平。依據目前事實之說明。吾人不能不承認國聯已走上第一條途徑。已有不惜任何犧牲以强致茍安一時之假和平之决心。盟約旣已破壞矣。公理亦已拋棄矣。日本固可以得意昂首驕傲世界凌國轈中矣。國聯所得者果為何物。和平歟。此惟愚人乃能信之。故國聯今日之態度。吾人誠不勝其惋惜。</p>
<p>吾人敢聲言在公理之範圍內絕無條件可言。合乎公理則為是。背乎公理則為非。是非之間。不容誣衊不容含混。今日國聯如有維護合乎公理之和平之决心。則應依據盟約。作嚴正有效之裁判。如無此决心。或無行使裁判之力。則應如英代表西門所建議謂（理事會不若當衆直認不能解决東北問題。）坦白宣佈盟約之無效。與聯盟之解體。蓋目前之拖延政策。與盡力搜求無意義之解决辦法。以及毫無意義之集議。旣絕無裨於問題之解决。而且益足以予世人以極不良之印象也。</p>
<p>美胡佛總統在休戰紀念日之演說。有謂（和平為國防準備之產物。）其言尚不失為坦白。誠然。就目前呈現於吾人眼前之事實而觀察。吾人固不能不承認無實力上之充分準備而可以博得眞和平。然而人類從茲將離和平愈遠矣。</p>
<p>蘇聯拍拉夫達報對國聯之評論曾有云。（國際聯盟無他蓋亦瓜分中國之一種組織耳。但瓜分中國。須先有瓜分中國之戰爭。此種戰爭所以現在尚未發生者。因時尚未成熟也。）其然。豈其然乎。吾人誠不敢深信。但國聯今日。究以公理殉橫暴。抑持公理衛和平。則不能不深盼國聯作最後周詳之考慮。母徒屈服於最後事實。而貽人類以無窮之隱患。</p>

<p>這舉國一致內閣說的運動、雖說沒有什麼具體的表示、但最近松田氏等忙碌的往訪若槻·與西園寺公、這裏面已隱伏着一種活動的意義、此外松田氏等之暗中拉攏民政與政友的有力者、似科又是一種極明顯的象徵、</p>
<p>浮說日甚、若槻首相於前日（十四日）閣僚及與黨懇談會中、劈頭就表明了一些意見、打算一掃從來之流言與浮說、[最近的時局誠然是一個多難多事之秋、但要解决這難問題、實在非現內閣不可、最近黨內外所唱的[舉國一致內閣]說、除阻害政府之國際信用以外、於國家實無利可言、此種輕舉妄動、我們應嚴厲禁止之、同時自己還須努力前進、善處目前的重大時局、庶幾上以副天皇之付託、下以慰萬民之期待]云云、</p>
<p>當時政府及與黨的一部分、很相信這演說可以奏效、藉此能掃除若干時局上之不安、但在事實上講、似乎還有多少疑問存在的餘地、（一）元老重臣方面對於若槻首相的態度、最近已表示有極度的失望、同時欲打開目前的時局紛擾起見、很有使現內閣後退之意向、（二）若槻首相對於目前的難局、自身也似乎已有了若干[日暮途窮]之感、同時豫料在出席最近議會時、亦無安渡難關之把握、所以對於聯立內閣或協力內閣之組織、已具有相當之諒解、（三）對軍部關係上、尚殘留着多少重大未决的條件、（四）政局微動中的中心人物淞田氏等、不出席於十四日的懇談會、從這幾種關係而觀、若槻首相的演說、在實際上未必能發生何種有力的效果、而若槻內閣的運命、又似乎已是[強弩之末]了、</p>
<p>總之舉國一致內閣的運動、目前已小具雛形、在二十一日安達內相歸京以後、一定可以比較表面化一些、但若槻內閣壽命之畢竟如何、聯立內閣之是否因難產而夭、則全視乎今後國際情形之變幻以為斷、而遠東未來局勢之安危、又全繋乎今度日本政變之消長了、（十一月十六日壽發）</p>

<p>甲午中日之戰葉志超衛汝貴丁汝昌</p>
<p>左寶貴等初敗於牙山。再敗於平壤。而或死或走雖不堪任戰事。卒致喪師沈艦。而清廷猶疊下諭旨。降革逮問。以昭賞罰。至不得已。而始命侍郞張蔭桓巡撫越友廉議和。日人以非全權拒之。於是復改派李鴻章。啣全權大臣命以往。抵馬關。遂與日總理伊籐博文。外務陸奧光宗。會議於春帆樓。博文笑謂李曰。[與中堂別來十年。中國毫無變改。以至有今日。]李聞。大慙及開議。李以停戰請。博文要以大沽天津山海關為質。李抗爭之。卒不肯應。自會所出猝遇刺客小山丰太郞。左顴中槍傷。受創甚。驚耗所傳。歐美諸邦胥不平。致其非難。日人恐。始許停戰。然則李之爭。有足多者。而列强之抗議。亦未始不能以挫當時蕞爾島國方張之氣也。</p>
<p>時清光緒二十一年三月。約成。即所謂馬關條約是。而國內上下洶洶。交詆李之不克折衝樽俎間。割地償費。有辱使命。奏疏不一月。多至百數十上。幾為衆矢之的。江督劉坤一。直督王文韶。鄂督張之洞。劾之尤力。請將李交刑部治罪。以謝國人。清廷因將先後辦理緣由。及對日之苦衷。明白告諭。頒示國中。嗣李每對人曰。[不謂香濤做官至今日。猶是書生之見。為之掀髯者再。然李亦嘗歎曰。甲午之媾和。我不任咎。使當日不改清漪園為頣和園。以日修萬二千金。不挹注於海軍經費。而供西后笑樂之需則十提之內北洋海軍船砲。可甲地球。何致一敗至斯。]此老固諳於時勢。而非甘心賣國者。當時且謚之為漢奸。為千夫所指。而猶不能逃夫清議如此。昔梁任公。謂]吾國二百年來之外交家。只有二李。]（梁著有二李傳一篇）蓋長髪軍時代。唯李秀成一人。中日一役。唯李鴻章一人耳。其言亦當已。舍斯兩人。而欲彼善於此。恐不復可得。噫。今之負使命而折衝於壇坫者。其勿使今人旣哀於前而任後人復哀於今也。</p>

<p>— 寓一</p>
<p>我偶然翻一本舊書。發現日本人第一次發跡的大賣買這一次賣買。一共搶到金銀財寶綢緞飾物。籠總有八十大船。</p>
<p>時在神功皇后攝政的年間。約西歷二百零一年。距今已隔一千七百餘年。起先因為仲衰天皇征伐熊襲（日本一州名）叛亂。失敗而死。</p>
<p>神功皇后就起而攝政。得着了兩件奇怪的聚兆。一件是在松浦海濱釣魚發的一個誓。說是如果用一顆米飯釣到魚哩。就可以攻無不克。結果。竟然釣到。一件是在海邊上洗自己的頭髪。祝告道如果一經洗濯。頭髪就自然而然的分作兩股哩就得勝利。看來。眞成兩股。於是沒有疑惑的捨棄熊襲。大造船隻。呌一聲孩兒們。一齊殺到高麗。</p>
<p>那時的高麗分作好幾國。新羅靠在釜山。最近日本。不過那時的朝鮮和日本相隔的海峽。不如現在的近。日本人祗知新羅國在過海的西邊。究竟在何地點。還無確實的認得。由漁船的引導。羅盤針的指使。先發現飛的島。後看見隱隱的山。終於由其信心得達到眞的新羅國。新羅國那時從不知道東方有人。忽然間看見許多大船許多倭人。以為莫不是從天而降。一時措手不及。也如現今不抵抗主義。獻白旗。獻珍物。開門迎降。更不知鬼使似誓願永為屬國。永不叛變要是叛變。除非是江水反流。江中之石升到天上。並且把弓矢懸在降樓上。把兒子和八十餘大臣送到日本國。去這麼一來日本人除得着了八十大船的贓物滿載而歸外。更得着新羅國王。年年進貢。歲歲來朝。國裏熊襲的叛亂。不征而又自定了。從此以後。日本國就發跡起來說是這事奇怪。但拿瀋陽事變看起來。倒不奇怪。</p>

<p>顏色的快鏡攝影用攝影機攝取天然顏色的照片。早就是可能的事。但是手續繁複。費用也太大。最近却有一個可喜的消息。便是英國攝影界中又有了一個驚人的新發明。人們可以攝取顏色的照片。其手續之簡易與代價之低廉。竟與攝取黑白的照片不相上下。這顏色的攝影機的面積。並不較大於普通的手提攝影機。其價格也不會超過五六金鎊。每機有紅黃藍三種玻片。鏡頭中的光很平均的反映在每一塊玻片上。三種乾片立時攝得。但者是用的平常的片子。便是洗印的手續。也與平常的一樣。不過這些乾片者疊放在一張特製的有感光性的紙上。這其間就包含着全部的秘密。只須三分鐘。已可印成一張顏色的照片。而那紙張的代價每張也不到三個便士。每一套乾片。可以印成無數的顏色照片。連洗的手續也可省免。聽說這新發明品不久就可出現於巿上了。</p>

<p>我國愛日侵略。最為痛創者。自甲午始。除割去台灣。折毀大沽砲台。賠償軍費四萬萬元外。復指定蘇浙兩省。開闢租界。（清時吳縣尚係省治）。奉倭命來蘇議地之日人。其名不復記憶。維時巡撫鹿傳霖。尚著廉聲。當會同邑紳陸潤庠俞曲園諸耆。共商地點。俞雖德清產。然久居吳門。文名遍海宇。有才子稱。故亦躋縉紳之列。得議外交。且木屐兒拜曲園之門。沐彼春風者甚夥。該日人適為其一。俞益為當道所推崇。惟其眼光銳遠。秉性剛直。逈非時下賣國者流可比。會陸已入軍機。告假在籍。亦以清廉著。若輩磋商之際。以日人由唐以來。屢寇我境。未免抑鬰不平。結果。以盤門外青陽地予以一隅。（當時蘇州只有閶胥·盤·婁·齊·葑六門）。日人以金閶敏華故。始則堅欲勘地閶外。愈迺引唐入詩。有（閶門過去盤門路。一樹垂楊一畫樓）句。以證青陽敏華之歷史。復稱該地毘連蘇關。為蘇滬航行必經之區。於此而闢商埠。洵屬相當。該日人固熟讀唐詩者。居然自命風雅。遂以青旨地簽約矣。但該地雖闢成租界。而蘇地資本家。雅無投資以興建築。日人所築馬路徒供馬車之馳驅耳。旋陸潤庠創議於閶胥之間。自闢馬路。振興巿面。邑人踴躍樂徒。不二年青陽地巿廛未成。而閶胥馬路之銜接。憶呈十里紅塵。繼以滬寗路綫。定閶齊之交為車站。則吳門之繁華。集中金閶矣。從此青陽一隅。日見其銅駝荊棘。碧草蔓地。輒當春夏之交。惟聞衰鳥亂鳴。秋冬之夜。徒見瑩火雜現。日人以無利可圖遂未大加經營。至今僅設機關一所。派駐警察數名而已。是以三十數年來。僑民寥寥。雖具侵略野心。効果仍等於零。况屬我國內地。依法不能視津漢同逞狡計也撫今思昔。不得不歸功於俞陸諸先哲焉。</p>

<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>鄉下人想起了買響鑼的事：原來近日鄉鎭上的土匪，是常常到各處去滋擾。大批的匪徒，如入無人之境，擄人勒贖，請財神，接觀音，都不算一回事。什麼城裏派去的公安局警察隊，都有些不公不安，不警不察，反而常常去敲他們的竹槓。鄉下人只得為自衛計，預備了幾種武器，召集了幾個壯丁，遇有匪徒來時，給他去抵抗一下，他們也知道無抵抗主義，是人類最屈辱的事。他們又要備好幾面很響的銅鑼，倘然有匪徒來時，有人看見了，急忙把鑼一敲。於是一有警報，全村的鑼聲都響亮了，各村子都起來響應了，各村鎭的壯丁，都起來和土匪抵抗了，當時就派了這位鄉下人，到蘇州城內王東文銅器店裏去買銅鑼，鑼要越響越好，方可以一敲動了，合村鎭都聽見咧。</p>
<p>什麼是響螺？他從來也不曾聽得，吃飯的菜裏有那種名稱。那個夥計，也說不明白。再者，那種新鮮的響螺，價錢也很貴，料想這個鄉下土老兒，也吃不起那種貴品，他也不再報那種菜了。或者普通一些兒的菜，他還可以明白點。　　[插燒？你要來一點嗎]夥計想，這是我們廣東館子裏最旁通的菜了。　　[此地有拆稍的嗎？]鄉下人又誤會了，大驚小怪起來了。</p>
<p>他久聞上海有所謂拆稍黨的，兇惡非凡。見人家有了幾個錢，他就要來拆你的稍有人說：這班拆稍黨就是流氓。拆稍兩字，就是設施的意思。鄉下人上一次到上海來，就有一位朋友告訴他：[上海的地方不好弄，流氓太多，專事敲詐為生活。有小流氓有大流氓，就造成上海這樣一個流氓世界。]鄉下人却說：[我不怕！他們要敲詐人家，總是那人有了幾個錢，所以看想他了。我是一個鄉下人，一無所有，他們也敲詐不出什麼來。]</p>
<p>但是那個朋友還是警戒他，說道：[自然！你不是有錢的人，沒有被敲詐的資格。可是上海小流氓也很多，看你是個鄉下新上來，有些土頭土腦的樣子，他們不論借一點小事上，便可以拆你的稍了。你可知道上海要擺一個攤，也有人來拆稍；買到了一樣便宜的東西，也有人來拆稍：Ｌ馬路上走走路，平白無故也有人來拆稍。這都是小的拆稍，可是也要當心啊。]</p>
<p>鄉下人牢記在心，今天聽得那夥計問他要不要插燒，他誤聽了拆稍，怎不驚惶起來。</p>

<p>姚主敎路屍身之由來</p>
<p>顧順章投誠中央後</p>
<p>為共黨內部所不容</p>
<p>愛棠村遂有此慘變</p>
<p>前後共殺死十一人</p>
<p>修德里亦有藏屍</p>
<p>自前日法租界姚主敎路愛棠村三十三及三十七兩號院落、中發現大批被人謀斃之男女屍身後、轟傳全滬、均嘆為空前罕觀之慘案、惟當時傳說紛紜、悉以為定係綁匪架得肉票、因未備價回贖、致遭撕票之禍、而國湮屍滅跡、並稱近因漢口破獲綁匪多人、供出本案始末、方由漢電致法捕房、請其就地查勘云云、當時記者對於此種傳說、即抱非常疑慮、僉以為旣屬撕票、此大批肉票、究屬何處綁來、而綁匪又何以在漢破獲、若謂肉票係自漢架滬者、則數千里之隔、乘輪須經四五日之久、沿途軍警密佈、匪即至愚、亦絕不出此、况匪之架票、目的不過金錢、即屬絕不獲已、偶然撕票、為數亦絕不致成批、此事實之最明顯者、記者當時即疑本案中或含有政治作用、及其他特殊情形、直至昨日將屍身掘出發殮時、果有人前往認領、所有屍身、乃係一家骨肉、是案起因、因衆死者家人之一、為共產黨重要份子、嗣後悔悟、在漢向鄂主席何成濬自首、最後又經蔣主席召之入京、畀以要職、共籌清共之策、因此遭共產黨人之怒、出此毒策、將其闔家所有人等一齊謀斃、即傭僕孩提、無一倖免、亦云慘矣、今將經過詳情、探錄於后、</p>
<p>屍體纍纍臭腐不堪　本案自法捕房於二十一日接得漢口當局來電、謂漢地拘獲綁匪多人、供出扯票實情、將尸體九具埋藏本埠法租界姚主敎路愛棠村三十三·三十七兩號屋內、請為偵查等情、捕頭即派中西包探、按址前往調查在大門內天井中掘開泥土、果見木板、在𨻶縫中窺見尸體纍纍、惟已臭腐不堪、捕房為愼重計、俟呈報法院、再行挖掘等情、已誌報端、茲悉此案確非綁匪扯票、確係政治性質、捕房於昨日上午報告第二特區地方法院、於十一時、由首席檢察官陳備三、偕同檢察官丁仕奎·法醫魏立功·姜璿·書記官彭玥同乘汽車至埋尸處實地勘騐、其時捕房西探督察白而地、與特別機關偵探督察員金我九林、通班中西包探、率同小工等、在場等候、</p>
<p>男女赤裸屍身七具　諸事準備已妥、檢察長等相偕蒞止、即命小工開始發掘、先在三十三號掘土約四寸許、起出男屍三具、又繼續在三十七號起出女孩尸各一均已腐爛、面目糢糊莫辨、最初弄中觀看者異常擁擠、雖經巡捕竭力驅逐、然隨散隨集、但一見尸身起出、衆人聞此異味後、皆掩鼻一哄而散、至此由陳檢察官命令繼續挖掘、一面着捕房將尸體施用衛生藥品、避除臭味、一齊車送騐屍所、候檢騐畢、即與丁檢察長等回院旋至下午、又由工人等掘出一男兩女、前後共掘出七具計四男三女、屍身均皆赤裸、兩手用繩反縛、頸間套有繩圏、當時似先行勒斃然後掩埋者、</p>
<p>顧順章係共黨健將　當檢騐時、淞滬警備司令部及黨部均派員在旁察看、據稱是案內容完全係政治作用、共產黨人萁荳相煎、同類相殘之一種慘酷手段也、所有死者均係吳淞人顧順章之家屬、顧現年廿七歲為一有為青年、前在南洋烟草公司任事、一度出洋、留學德國、心醉馬克斯主義之說、回國後、即加入共黨工作、迭任共黨中央委員·中央政治委員、民十六任全國工界糾察隊總指揮、兼巿府委員、等要職、與共黨重要份子向宗發·李立三·周恩來·等齊名同稱四大健將</p>
<p>在漢被捕自請解京　此四人中、又以顧性最兇很黨中曾派彼四人、在滬組織共黨赤衛隊、專司一切暗殺職務、本年四月間顧奉黨中命令、派往漢口指揮黨務、顧即由滬偕同伴數人、乘輪赴漢、不料事機不密、顧等一行人尚未抵漢、已被漢口總司令部行營偵悉、派員在碼頭守捕、迨顧等船方泊岸、即遭逮捕、惟當時祇獲三人、一人漏網、詎顧被拘後、解至行營訉問時、顧忽一言不發、祇稱須至南京面見蔣主席、方可陳供、行營乃不再問遂即解至南京面謁蔣總司令、</p>
<p>謁蔣主席矢志投誠　顧抵京見蔣後、力述過去錯誤、甘願悔過自新、並將赤黨內容組織、一併獻於蔣總司令之前、幸蔣素以寬大為懷、更見顧之態度異常誠懇、遂不咎旣往、且羅致幕下、留在亦中、共商剿共大計、聞向忠發在滬被逮伏法、於顧不無關係、斯時顧之家屬住在本埠威海衛路八零二號、自願往漢、滬上之家屬、由同志周恩來照顧保護、顧被拘留在京、由其在漢同志將信電知滬上顧之家屬云顧已被拘、勢必有抄家之險、囑即覓地搬遷、當時顧之家屬接電後、因即遷居法租界姚主敎路愛棠村卅三卅七兩號、</p>
<p>李龍章供慘殺經過　迨後周恩來訪知顧拘禁在京、投誠未死、往詢顧妻張氏、謂你夫現在被捕、投誠不死將來必有官做、勢必洩漏黨中機密、如果你夫接你到京、你見了丈夫之面、你心中以為如何、顧妻答以當然服從丈夫意旨、周聞顧妻回答之言、即起狠殺之心、連夜命其同黨中人帮同將顧全家與親戚等全行處死、埋尸滅跡、周亦逃匿無踪、此次漢口當局拘獲周之同黨帮兇李龍章一名、一再嚴鞠、始供出殺死顧順章全家之事、及藏尸之處、當局據供、電請本埠法捕房偵查、始得破案、起出尸體、昨雖起出男女七具、但原電云有九具、故尚在發掘中、</p>

<p>— 川</p>
<p>十一月十九·二十·兩日、上海各大學學生抗日救國聯合會决議舉行向各界募欵以援助黑省健兒、十九日的早晨八點鐘、我們便在校內聚齊、以宿舍每一房間六人為一小隊、每兩房間為一組、外加女生二人、每隊各分發小旗一面、募捐竹筒一隻、各同學精神飽滿、於九時即出發、</p>
<p>東北二十萬大軍、因為上官一道（不抵抗）的命令、使日軍兵不血刃得了遼寗吉林兩省的地方、幸而有黑龍江的馬占山將軍以守土有責、不肯使黑龍江也犧牲於亂命之下、乃集一省的兵力保衛國土、六戰六勝、使虎狼之衆不敢猖獗、我們對於這一位忠勇的將軍應如何致其敬意、更應當怎樣加以援助、我們是熱血的青年、我們不能像政府那樣徒發幾篇宣告、而不與以直接的援助、所以在出發的時候、隊員都不顧及辛苦、勇往前進、作他們的工作、</p>
<p>我們一隊七人、出法華鄕、沿霞飛路一帶、一面走、一面向過往的行人同中國店家募捐、我們用極誠懇的態度對他們說、（我們都是中國人、我們願意作亡國奴嗎、現在黑龍江方面、中日正在激戰、可是塞外孤軍、當日軍强頑之衆、道是中國生死存亡的大關鍵、我們能忍心而不救嗎、諸位都是中國人、都是愛國志士、那麼請在未亡國之前略盡一點綿力、與以經濟上的援助、）說完就把竹筒拿到面前、有的人聽了我們這一番話、都很告奮勇、把錢放在筒子裏面、而有一般人、不但不捐欵、還故意作出一種倖倖之色、極端鄙視我們、口裏還不乾不净的罵兩句、我們自然不一定要勉强人捐、不過心裏總不高興、我們很懷疑這些人是不是中國人、</p>
<p>我們走到南京路上、到三家大公司向那些顧客來捐欵、成績極好、因為他們是出的起錢、而又當着許多人、不好意思不捐、尤其是一般女子、不用我們費話、就把錢拿出來、其實她們並不是特別的比男子愛國、却是因為面子的問題、而我們就藉着這個、募集的很多、不過有一件事使我痛心到極點、</p>
<p>我們走到永安公司儲蓄部募欵、有一位中年人、大約有四十幾歲的光景、正存入大洋一千元、我們就懇求他捐一些、費了許多時候、他依然不肯、裏面的職員、也帮助我們講話、而他始終一文不鳴、最後還說、（當亡國奴算了、捐什麼、）我們驟然間聽見這一些話、還不肯相信、又反問（他甘心作亡國奴嗎）（對了、我情願作亡國奴、）他很堅决的說、當時有一位隊員怒冲冲的跑過去要同他理論、還要飽以老拳、我們都不願多事、就把他拉住了、我們承認這種沒心肝的人不値得費我們寶貴的時光來同他理論、他也只配作亡國奴、只配給外國人牛馬般的驅使、</p>
<p>下午我們回校了、走了一天的路、辛苦極了、肚子裏面又空、可是我們的精神依然極好、心裏更覺得愉快、</p>
<p>二十日消息傳來、塞外孤軍、因為前有强敵、後無援兵、士卒飢疲械彈不繼、不得已而退至克山鎭、黑龍江遂告失守、我們的血管裂了、後援子彈之不繼、責在政府、而食糧之缺乏、人民至少要担一份責任、所以我們出發的時候、更加倍的興奮、加倍的努力、可是今天的成績却退步了、原因就是捐過的人已經很多了、</p>
<p>有一個小孩子、大約只有七八歲的光景、同他的小弟弟在街頭閒玩、看見我們走來、就把他手裏面的三個銅子、拿來給我們、我們看他很苦、就對他說、（好孩子、你眞是愛國、你只有三個銅子、留着買東西吃吧、）他始終不肯、還放在竹筒裏面、他的三個銅子比那富豪的幾十塊現洋重多了、中國所需要的是這樣子的人、並不是那沒心肝的亡國種子、</p>

<p>Secret Meeting Yesterday Underwent a Revision</p>
<p>(Paris) The League of Nations Administrative Council convened at 10:50 AM this morning to consider the draft resolution on the League of Nations' dispatch of an investigation committee to Manchuria. The resolution will only take effect if both China and Japan endorse it. Currently, the opinions of the two countries on this issue are very different, so it is generally believed that it is very difficult to formulate a resolution that is acceptable to both parties. Yesterday, League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond, with the assistance of League of Nations experts, engaged in this work all day long. It is reported that the draft will instruct the committee not to contain any real power to interfere in the dispute, and will separate the issue of troop withdrawal from Manchuria from the dispatch of the committee, so that the troop withdrawal will not be affected by the appointment of the committee or the actions of the committee. This morning, the Administrative Council agreed to adjourn the meeting at 12:10 PM after the resolution was确切based on Japan's proposal and in line with the Administrative Council's views on the issue. The date of the public meeting to present the resolution has not yet been determined, as it is necessary to ensure that the proposal is viable and unanimously passed. If the proposal cannot be unanimously passed, that is, if the proposal cannot obtain the endorsement of both China and Japan, then the Administrative Council must record that agreement could not be reached on this matter. The representatives of China and Japan did not attend this morning's meeting. The draft resolution will be submitted to the Chinese and Japanese governments this afternoon, and the Administrative Council will hold another non-public meeting at 11:00 AM tomorrow morning. (23rd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) When the Administrative Council met this morning to consider the draft resolution on dispatching an investigation committee to Manchuria drafted by Drummond, the proposal was greatly revised. It will now be distributed separately by Briand to Yoshizawa and Dr. Shi Zhaoji. The Administrative Council hopes that the proposal can be finally passed at tomorrow morning's meeting. It is reported that the passage of the troop withdrawal case will be based to some extent on the resolution of the Administrative Council on September 30. As for the investigation committee investigating not only Manchuria but also various provinces of China, it is reported that the resolution will vaguely refer to it, without mentioning the words Manchuria or China. The power of the committee is very broad, and it can fully investigate all matters relating to the Sino-Japanese dispute. (23rd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Administrative Council has set a meeting for 10:00 AM tomorrow morning to reconvene. This morning, France showed significant optimism about the plan to dispatch a committee to investigate everything, but said that there are still many thorns ahead, and nothing can be predicted yet. It is generally believed that the work of the Administrative Council is expected to end at the end of this week. (22nd Guomin News Agency Telegram)</p>
<h3 id="e9">Shi Zhaoji Strives for Legitimate Rights at the League of Nations <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Troop Withdrawal Issue Not Resolved Satisfactorily</p>
<p>Investigation Team Plan Difficult to Accept</p>
<p>Japanese Government Sends New Instructions to Yoshizawa</p>
<p>Hints at the Scope and Power of the Spot Check</p>
<p>(Paris) At the open meeting of the Board of Directors on Saturday, our country's representative strongly rejected the investigation committee plan that was unrelated to the withdrawal of troops, creating a stalemate. Therefore, no action could be taken at the meeting. Currently, the Chinese delegation is striving in all aspects for the legitimate rights that member states of the League of Nations should have, hoping to obtain a resolution to the troop withdrawal issue. Although League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond has ordered the League of Nations Drafting Committee to draft a resolution on the investigation committee under the supervision of Briand, it is heard that Briand intends that this resolution cannot be submitted to a public meeting without obtaining unanimous agreement through private contact. Therefore, the leaders of the Board of Directors have been busy discussing and contacting each other day and night today. However, given China's opposition and Japan's stubborn attitude, some people believe that this matter may still not be resolved. Today, Yoshizawa and Matsudaira met with Simon, Shi Zhaoji met with Dawes and Briand. It is reported that the Japanese representative has also received new instructions from his government on the progress of the investigation team plan. Other directors, in view of the stalemate within the Board of Directors, are also seeking instructions from their respective governments. (22nd Guomin News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) Chinese Chief Representative Dr. Shi Zhaoji declared to an Associated Press reporter who visited him today that he would not allow the League of Nations Board of Directors to evade China's request for immediate troop withdrawal. Shi met with US Ambassador Dawes this afternoon, but Shi did not want to express whether his conversation was related to this. He only declared to the Associated Press reporter that China has not changed its position, nor has it changed the declaration of its delegation at the Saturday conference. Any plan that attempts to delay the troop withdrawal with excuses will not be accepted. China will certainly support the proposal for an investigation committee, but only after the Board of Directors resolves the troop withdrawal issue. (22nd Guomin News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) The diplomatic community here is quite active today due to the Manchurian affairs. Dr. Shi saw Dawes, and after the British Foreign Secretary Simon received Matsudaira, he also met with Dawes and League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond. Yoshizawa visited Briand at 6:00 PM tonight, detailing the Japanese proposal to send nationals from neutral countries to Manchuria for investigation. Yoshizawa has received instructions from Tokyo regarding this Japanese proposal. Therefore, he informed Briand of the Japanese government's position in detail and stated that in order to emphasize the flexibility of this proposal, he did not want to submit a written memorandum. The Japanese government suggests that the committee be composed of three people: one as a French representative to show respect for Administrative Council President Briand, one as a British representative because Britain is known for being impartial and has significant relations in the Far East, and one as a US representative because the United States is the largest country in the world and also has significant interests in Manchuria. According to Yoshizawa, the representatives of these three countries can guarantee fairness. Chinese and Japanese representatives can also join, and the investigation team must of course have secretaries and translators. Yoshizawa does not limit the number of committee members to three or five, but believes that a committee with a very small number of people is more convenient, easier to implement, and can handle matters more quickly. Yoshizawa also argued that the committee should conduct investigations in mainland China and Manchuria, and should study the general situation that led to the current crisis, China's failure to fulfill its obligations under Sino-Japanese treaties, China's rejection of Japanese interests, and other thousands of difficulties between China and Japan. The Japanese government suggests that the committee should first go to China, and Yoshizawa will probably insist on this point. The Japanese government's proposal reiterates the reservations Yoshizawa made yesterday, that is, the committee must not interfere with Sino-Japanese direct negotiations and must not monitor the actions of the Japanese army. The second reservation can give Japan complete freedom to adopt defense plans or consider withdrawing troops to respond to the needs of the situation as it sees fit. Yoshizawa also claimed that he had received a telegram confirming that the Japanese army had begun to withdraw. The public here believes that British Foreign Secretary Simon, who is the leading figure in the British legal community, will probably be responsible for drafting the regulations of the League of Nations committee. Today, the League of Nations Secretariat announced two documents it received from Chinese representatives, one reporting that Japanese aircraft bombed and destroyed 3,000 of Ma Zhanshan's soldiers in Hailun, and saying that the Japanese army intends to penetrate Keshan and attack the northern border of Jehol, and one reporting that other military strongholds in Manchuria have been occupied by the Japanese army, but without mentioning the details. (22nd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government issued another instruction to Yoshizawa today, but did not announce its content, only saying that it was related to the details of the scope and power of the investigation team. The Japanese say that all members of the Administrative Council except the Chinese representative recognize the legitimacy of the reasons Japan claims cannot allow it to fully stop hostile actions and immediately withdraw troops. If the Administrative Council cannot persuade China to abandon its two demands for a ceasefire and troop withdrawal, it is feared that the investigation team's plan will ultimately be a pipe dream, and the Administrative Council can only restate its resolution of September 30 and issue another declaration asking China and Japan not to take any further actions that would aggravate the situation. The Japanese believe that this new declaration is necessary in order to prevent a major conflict from occurring near Jinzhou. (23rd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) The delegations are working extremely hard. In addition to the Chinese and Japanese delegations, the French, American, and British representatives are also very active. Judging from the situation, the representatives of these five countries seem to have formed a subcommittee. Dawes, Simon, and Drummond all spoke with Shi Zhaoji. Drummond spoke with Simon for a long time. Simon will be responsible for drafting the report on the Japanese proposal. Drummond also met with Briand. At 6:30 PM, Briand received Yoshizawa and will consider the various points under discussion together. Matsudaira is also very active and has met with Dawes and others. What the results of the talks were, all parties have kept silent, but major difficulties are present everywhere, and the Administrative Council will have to go to great lengths to resolve them. The authorities do not deny this. (22nd Havas News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>(Shenyang) A Reuters correspondent learned today that Puyi has returned from a certain hotel in the Tankengzi Hot Springs to the Kwantung Leased Territory. He is probably currently living somewhere between Dalian and Lushun. The Dalian Police Department issued a statement regarding Puyi's whereabouts, saying that Puyi was heard to have arrived in Yingkou from Tianjin on November 13 and is now seeking the protection of the Japanese, which the Japanese have granted. The Japanese, in view of the Japanese government's attitude of not wanting to be dragged into any political entanglement, are now making various considerations to prohibit him from contacting the outside world. From this, it can be seen that foreigners who want to meet the deposed emperor will not be allowed by the Japanese, and the enthronement ceremony has become a dream. (23rd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese embassy issued a statement today, saying that the deposed Emperor Xuantong, who left Tianjin on November 10, appeared in Yingkou and requested protection.

<p>(Moscow) Today's newspaper published a telegram from Beiping correcting the report that it was not Russians who supplied Ma Zhanshan and other Chinese troops in the three eastern provinces with firearms and ammunition, but Japanese nationals. It is said that a Japanese newspaper in Dalian has recently vaguely mentioned this matter, saying that these military supplies were supplied by the International Transportation Company (transliteration). The company's management agencies are located on the South Manchuria Railway's railway lines and other places, and also have considerable connections with the Dalian Customs and other transportation companies. The munitions supplied to General Ma Zhanshan seem to have been transported via Harbin. Now the Japanese military authorities are doing their best to strictly suppress it.

<p>Provoking Russia Only Weakens Themselves</p>
<p>A Pacific War Is Ultimately Inevitable</p>
<p>(Moscow) Today, Soviet Russian newspapers unanimously used extremely harsh language to warn against the Japanese army's provocative actions against the Soviet Union in Manchuria. Pravda declared, "(The Soviet Union's policy is to strive for peace, but this should not be taken as the Soviet Union tolerating all insults and destruction from the outside without punishment.)" Pravda is the organ of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party and the mouthpiece of the Soviet Russian government. The newspaper further stated, "(May all imperialists in Paris, Tokyo, and Washington hear this.)" Soviet newspapers all said that Japan has angered the entire Chinese population, and now it is recklessly provoking the Soviet Union, which is actually weakening itself. Since a war for hegemony in the Pacific is inevitable, imperialists from countries like Japan and the United States are doing their best to set traps. Izvestia said that Japan has been in an isolated position since the Washington Conference. If China suffers a major blow in Manchuria, other competing imperialists may help China to eliminate Japan. If Japan worsens its relationship with Soviet Russia, the United States will secretly laugh at it from the sidelines, because this move will affect Japan's position on the western coast of the Pacific. Pravda also stated that all the League of Nations countries want is the distribution of Chinese treasures, and the US Ambassador to Britain, Dawes, is now in Paris monitoring the League of Nations' meetings, the purpose of which is also to reserve a large part for the United States of America when dividing China. The remaining Russian newspapers all stated that Japan should immediately express its peaceful policy towards the Soviet Union with actions, and should not just express it with empty words. Furthermore, Japan should immediately stop the anti-Soviet propaganda policy. (United Nations Electricity on the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Moscow) This morning, the Soviet Russian semi-official organ, Izvestia, also severely criticized the League of Nations' dispatch of an investigation team, saying that Japan has absolutely no intention of withdrawing its troops, and the League of Nations certainly does not want to expel Japan from the territory of its illegally occupied neighbor. The League of Nations has completely succumbed to Japan, and now it proposes to send a special committee, granting it powers similar to those of academic research institutions. Even the withdrawal of Japanese troops is no longer mentioned. This shows that among imperialists, they cannot oppose Japan unless they are killing each other. Therefore, what these countries are paying attention to today is only seeking compensation for allowing Japan to expand its power in China. Japanese imperialists are calmly carrying out their work, consolidating their position, neither fearing the intervention of the League of Nations nor fearing the obstruction of other imperialists. At the same time, China has been exploited by warlords to the point of extreme poverty. This development easily ignites the revolutionary fuse of the Chinese people, prompting them to resist the invaders and causing the most serious consequences. Therefore, the situation in the Far East today is on the verge of exploding. In addition, Japanese soldiers, disregarding the will of their government and the declarations of their diplomats, are acting arbitrarily, which further increases the seriousness of the situation. Soviet Russia will cautiously pay attention to the provocative policies of Japanese soldiers, but the grabbing of Manchuria will be a terrible and dangerous move, which only short-sighted military men can do. These people have forgotten the great resistance of the Chinese people to the Japanese people. In short, the imperialists' gunboat policy in the Far East is about to ignite the powder keg they themselves buried. (National Press Agency Telegram on the 23rd)</p>
<h3 id="e15">A Glimpse of British and French Public Opinion <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>(London) The London Daily News stated this morning that there are still many questionable points about the League of Nations committee that is now proposed to investigate the situation in Manchuria. However, unless Japan gives up the territory it has conquered and awaits a proper ruling on this dispute in a legitimate form, this position will only insult international authority and international justice. (Reuters Telegram on the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Manchurian issue occupies less space in the newspapers today. The newspapers plan to judge the future changes in the Manchurian situation only after the results of private talks are obtained. Left-wing newspapers are closer to China, while right-wing newspapers still have little sympathy. The Discussion newspaper made a conclusion on yesterday's Executive Yuan meeting, saying that major difficulties remain to be resolved, and new military incidents may occur, which will make the situation even more complicated. It is too early to talk about a solution at this time. Evening newspapers reported that the positions of China and Japan are still the same as in September and October. Japan's approval of the investigation committee is actually a deep-seated plan. Japan will consolidate its position in Manchuria, hoping that the investigation team will delay for several months, and its scope of tasks seems boundless. Japan can profit from this. Judging from the procedures adopted by the Executive Yuan in October, Japan rejected it first and then approved it later. It can be seen that Japan's intention is to collect materials to oppose China. This relationship is important and needs to be clarified urgently, otherwise the Executive Yuan's resolution this time may easily be broken. From another aspect, there is a risk of differences between Japan, Soviet Russia, and the United States. After Litvinov made his note, Soviet Russia is still monitoring the development of the situation, and the United States regards the Japanese army's occupation of Qiqihar as a dangerous move. Japan should respond with the intention of withdrawing, but unfortunately, the degree of slowness in fulfilling the agreement is very different in the Far East and elsewhere, and various differences may arise as a result.

<h3 id="e16">Sacrificing Justice to Violence or Upholding Justice to Defend Peace <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Since its third meeting, the League of Nations has shown a clear and sudden change in attitude. Its submission to the established facts, its bowing and scraping, its siding with Japan and suppressing China, is a common sight to the people of the world. We can understand that the League of Nations wants to calm things down and mend the cracks in peace, and it is willing to submit and sacrifice China, even sacrificing justice to violence. However, we dare not agree with sacrificing justice to seek temporary peace, and we must point out the serious mistake of this idea.</p>
<p>Since September 18th, all the atrocities that Japan has inflicted on our country, even a three-foot-tall child should know that they are destroying peace, betraying alliances, and violating justice, using a violent military action to invade Chinese territory, to twice the size of their own country, openly changing flags and setting up offices within the territory of a neighboring country. At the same time, they are also vigorously expanding their military operations, while still claiming it is self-defense, claiming it is non-war action, claiming it does not violate the spirit of the League of Nations Covenant and the Non-Aggression Pact. The people of the world should immediately be able to understand that this kind of defense is extremely barbaric sophistry and is absolutely insufficient to cover up the truth of the facts. Since the facts are so clearly standing before us, if the League of Nations wants to deal with this issue and resolve this dispute, it only needs to be based on the standpoint of justice, uphold the spirit of maintaining peace, and make a solemn judgment based on the covenant. This is also an iron-like and immutable principle.</p>
<p>Today, the League of Nations yields to Japan and suppresses China, allowing the strong to satisfy their desires and the weak to swallow their grievances in silence, claiming to mend the cracks in peace and seek a temporary peace. This is indeed similar. However, we believe that the premise of peace must be justice, that is, peace must be based on justice in order to be guaranteed. A temporary peace that does not conform to justice is merely a submission to injustice, a patching up of war, intensifying the preparations and brewing of future wars. This kind of temporary peace is actually meaningless and worthless. The resulting benefit is enough to cause justice to be submerged in the abyss of ugliness and humiliation.</p>
<p>There are originally two ways to achieve peace. One is to achieve peace at any cost, but to achieve false peace, even sacrificing justice in the end is not hesitated. The other is to defend peace with justice, so that peace must conform to justice. The former is patching up, perfunctory, and temporary peace, while the latter is true peace, which is enough to win human praise and give mankind a happy and lasting peace. Based on the explanation of the current facts, we cannot but admit that the League of Nations has embarked on the first path and has the determination to force a temporary false peace at any cost. The covenant has been destroyed, and justice has also been abandoned. Japan can indeed be proud and arrogant in the world. What has the League of Nations gained? Peace? Only a fool can believe this. Therefore, we sincerely regret the attitude of the League of Nations today.</p>
<p>We dare to say that there are absolutely no conditions within the scope of justice. Conforming to justice is right, and violating justice is wrong. Between right and wrong, there is no room for slander or ambiguity. If the League of Nations today has the determination to maintain peace that conforms to justice, it should make a solemn and effective judgment based on the covenant. If it does not have this determination, or does not have the power to exercise judgment, it should, as British representative Simon suggested, say "(The Council might as well publicly admit that it cannot resolve the Northeast issue.)" Frankly announce the invalidity of the covenant and the dissolution of the League. The current delaying policy, the efforts to search for meaningless solutions, and the meaningless meetings are not only of no benefit to the resolution of the problem, but also enough to give the world an extremely bad impression.</p>
<p>US President Hoover said in his speech on Armistice Day, "(Peace is the product of defense preparation.)" His words are still frank. Indeed, judging from the facts presented before us, we cannot but admit that true peace cannot be won without full preparation in strength. However, mankind will be farther and farther away from peace from now on.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's Pravda newspaper commented on the League of Nations, saying, "(The League of Nations is nothing but an organization for dividing China. But to divide China, there must first be a war to divide China. The reason why this war has not happened yet is because the time is not yet ripe.)" Is that so? We dare not believe it deeply. But whether the League of Nations today sacrifices justice to violence or upholds justice to defend peace, we cannot but deeply hope that the League of Nations will make a final and thorough consideration, and not just succumb to the final facts and leave mankind with endless hidden dangers.</p>

<p>(Washington) Today, US Secretary of State Stimson again received a secret report from Ambassador to Britain Dawes regarding the progress of the Paris Council, the content of which Mr. Smith refused to publish. Recently, the US official market has been very cautious in commenting on the Sino-Japanese dispute in the three eastern provinces and the League of Nations meetings because Congress will open at the beginning of next month. Secretary of State Stimson has refused to talk to reporters about the three eastern provinces incident for several days. As for the congressmen, today Senator Robertson, the Democratic candidate for Vice President in the last presidential election, claimed that the Sino-Japanese dispute in the three eastern provinces will become increasingly serious. If the United States enters the vortex, there may be far-reaching results that are not conducive to the United States. For the benefit of the United States, it should not be interfered with.

<p>(New York) Japanese Foreign Minister Shidehara told a reporter from the United States Associated Press today that all the difficulties in Manchuria stemmed from China's long-standing open contempt for the treaties necessary for the safety of the Japanese people. Shidehara recounted the activities of Russia and Japan in Manchuria after 1895, saying that China has always been secretly allied with Russia during this period. If Japan had known this earlier, there would have been various reasons to take Russia's position in Manchuria and replace it. Shidehara also said that Japan still hopes for a peaceful resolution of the Sino-Japanese dispute. Shidehara also denied the claim that Japan is setting up a puppet government in Manchuria.

<p>(Dalian) China's economic boycott, that is, China's passive action, to retaliate against the Japanese army's occupation of Manchuria, is now severely hitting Japan's shipping industry along the Chinese coast. Both cargo and passengers on Japanese ships have decreased greatly. The Nisshin Steamship Company, which operates Yangtze River trade, has had to stop sailing many of its ships. The Dalian Steamship Company, which operates between Dalian and Shanghai, is also in poor business condition. What it carries is only European cargo transported by the Siberian Railway and some steerage Chinese who dare not live in Manchuria. The Japanese shipping industry between Tianjin and Shanghai is even worse. A Japanese shipman said that a certain Japanese ship that recently departed from Shanghai had only one passenger in the first and second class cabins. (Reuters Telegram on the 23rd)</p>

Three cheers for the Three Principles of the People. Then play music, take pictures, and end the meeting. (Special dispatch from the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chiang Kai-shek delivered a closing speech at the closing ceremony of the Fourth Plenary Session this morning. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Chairman, fellow comrades, today the Fourth National Congress is adjourned. The Presidium asked me to deliver the closing speech. As we close this meeting, we recall the Premier's speech at the closing of the First National Congress. The Premier said, "The struggle of party members is the same as the struggle of the army..." You have held a ten-day meeting here, and decided on many proposals. After the adjournment, you must bring them back to your local areas, distribute them to the comrades in your locality, and go to fight separately. Therefore, this conference is like a military conference, which has set various battle plans and handed them over to the generals to bring back for implementation. Simply put, our party members are like soldiers, and should act in unison and fight separately according to the battle plan set by the general headquarters. Today, we restate this precise lesson of the Premier as our closing speech. This time, when the country is plagued by internal and external troubles, especially when the spirit of the party is scattered and separated and people's hearts are shaken, the comrades of our Fourth National Congress, no matter how bizarre the rumors were before the meeting, and how complex the tricks of slander and alienation were, we adhered to a sincere love for the party and the country, established our confidence, and jointly completed the mission of the Fourth National Congress. I dare to say that this spirit of loving the party, loving the country, being loyal, and not being confused deserves to be a true believer of the Premier and can be worthy of the country and the people. We can hold this meeting and realize the unity of the party in the midst of disintegration, regardless of everything. This spirit is greater than anything else. Now we have closed the meeting. As for how to strive for the party and the country, our plans and policies have been determined. According to the Premier's words, if the party is compared to the army, the National Congress is the general headquarters, that is, the commander-in-chief of the whole country. Since we have the great responsibility of saving the party and saving the country, our National Congress must swear to fight to the death for the general public and the party. Now the closing words are no different from a mobilization speech. In this environment of internal and external troubles, our congress is like Zhuge Liang when he presented the "Chushi Biao" (Memorial on Dispatching the Army). The Premier said that in the past, in the imperial era, there was only one emperor. Now that the Republic of China has been established, sovereignty rests with the people. Therefore, today's 400 million compatriots are all emperors. Our Chinese Nationalist Party must take responsibility for these 400 million emperors to save the country and save the masters. Zhuge Liang's "Chushi Biao" is full of loyalty and grief. Now we are in Zhuge Liang's position. We must take responsibility for the 400 million masters to save the country. Everyone is clear about the environment in which our country and our party are now. At this time of severe natural disasters and people's livelihood is meager, Japanese imperialists are invading our territory and trampling on our country with powerful military force. This is truly a great disaster for our country and the greatest shame for our people. If we ourselves cannot unite and work together to fight against foreign enemies, the demise of the party and the country is imminent. I often say that our greatest disaster is not in foreign enemies. If we Chinese, especially Chinese party members, can be self-reliant, self-strengthening, and spiritually united, even if there are ten Japans, they cannot shake our country. Now we want to ask, is this foreign trouble because we are self-reliant and self-strengthening and are being invaded? This answer does not need me to elaborate. In short, our National Congress this time has absolutely no phenomenon of power struggle. We are doing our best to seek unity within the party and to defend against foreign aggression and save our country. We are not afraid of any powerful enemy, but only ask how we are and how the party's strength and spirit are. We must carefully examine ourselves and work together in politics and military affairs to seek long-term progress. The ancients said, "People must insult themselves before others insult them, and people must attack themselves before others attack them." This sentence can be our teaching. Yue Fei of the Song Dynasty was trapped by the Jin people, not because Yue Fei's combat ability was weak, but because he was jealous of the traitor Qin Hui in the rear, which led to the failure of his achievements. When Yue Fei was fighting hard and winning on the front line, the rear suddenly issued twelve gold medals ordering him to withdraw his troops. When we think of this, we feel that if the Chinese Nationalist Party wants to be determined to save the country, it is necessary to unify the country and concentrate its forces, especially to ensure that there are no traitors like Qin Hui in the rear to hinder or slander us, so as to achieve the goal of resisting foreign aggression. If we want to be responsible for saving the country, and some people not only do not want us to save the country, but also want to slander and frame us in various ways, then in addition to all the worries, there will be a serious difficulty. Our situation is now unfortunately showing this phenomenon. We must break through difficulties from countless restraints and slanderous layers to shoulder the responsibility of resisting foreign aggression. This requires the earnest attention of all representatives. The Premier once said that the United States has only one Washington, but this one Washington must be created by countless anonymous Washingtons. Now that we are in this situation of internal and external attacks and heavy difficulties, we can only sacrifice regardless of success or failure, with our sincerity, to save the country and resist foreign aggression. We want to use countless unnamed Yue Wumus to create a Yue Wumu of the Republic of China. We have nothing else to rely on today for the party and the country. We can only take a sincere heart like Zhuge Wuhou's determination to devote ourselves to the task until our death to repay the Premier and the people of the whole country. Because of the many problems in the country, everyone is very busy at this National Congress. Perhaps some of you comrades feel that there are some shortcomings in the spirit and discipline of the party. There may even be sadness, sighing, and unspeakable pain in the venue. This is not only the case for you, but also for me personally. But we must know that the spirit of loyalty and sincerity of this National Congress is more important than any other. From the 13th year of the Republic of China to today, the degree of danger of the country has never been like today. We gathered together in this unprecedented difficult situation to hold this meeting, so that our party can unite, so that the people know that we only care about the country's difficulties and not our selfishness, especially in this time of crisis, showing that we can express absolute magnanimity and painstaking efforts to seek the unity of the party to resist foreign aggression. We can express this spirit. In this point, it is the greatest success of the congress. In the past, after each national congress, I always felt a little uneasy. But when we close the meeting today, we can say that we are worthy of the Premier and the people. We really feel at ease and have no regrets. We are now working hard to move forward according to the resolutions of the congress. This time, we unanimously sacrificed everything and sought perfection in everything. In the very difficult situation of the party and the country, we completed our responsibilities and were able to take the Premier's heart as our heart and the Premier's will as our will. This is a matter worthy of special mention in the revolutionary history of the party. Therefore, we should not be discouraged. We have done our best to be loyal to the party and to the country. We can then take on the great task of saving the country without hesitation. Zhuge Liang used "devote oneself to the task until death" as his oath, and Yue Wumu used "loyalty to the country" as his oath. These are the common maxims of our party members and also the two firm oaths we tell the people of the whole country. Fellow representatives, we must all know that to this day, we can only carry forward our revolutionary morality and revolutionary spirit. The party members of the Chinese Nationalist Party want to save the country and save the masters. Not only do they want to be Zhuge Liang, but they also want to prepare to be Yue Wumu. Only in this way can they be worthy of the Premier's believers and live up to the mission of the Fourth National Congress. (Special dispatch from the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Dai Chuanxian delivered a speech at the expanded memorial week of the Fourth Plenary Session on the morning of the 23rd (doing his best to save the country), saying that the Fourth Plenary Session was held in the autumn of widespread natural disasters, urgent diplomacy, and national crisis. Everyone was able to be faithful, loyal, diligent, and cautious in deciding the national policy of resisting foreign aggression and internal unity. This is a fortunate thing for the future of the country and the nation. We firmly believe that in the future, we will definitely unite to resist foreign aggression and we will definitely be able to be sincere and united, do our best, and strive to achieve the goal of construction work. In the future, all party comrades must unite under the Premier's guidance, and must also lead the people in this spirit, so that the people of the whole country can unite to overcome the national crisis period, and build a solid foundation for the Republic of China in this period. Buy knowledge and ability to dedicate to duties and careers, and establish a solid foundation. Under the guidance of the two principles of restoring inherent morality and intelligence and catching up with world culture, seek improvement and progress. If we waste one minute of our time and energy on our own enjoyment, the duties and occupations will suffer a minute of loss. If we waste knowledge and ability for our own sake, our doctrine and policy will lose one minute of strength. Therefore, being loyal to our duties is the real way to save the country. The work of building the country, the more we are in times of national crisis, the more we should not forget the oath to serve the people and relieve their suffering. The actual key is in the sentence of being loyal to our duties. The oaths since the Tongmenghui have been like this. The more we are in times of crisis, the more everyone should firmly believe in and act on the oaths they have made. The oath is the life of the party, the savior of the country and the nation, and the guarantee of all doctrines and policies. If we can firmly believe in and act on the oath, the foundation of the country will definitely be consolidated and we will definitely win against foreign aggression. Now that the congress is adjourned, it coincides with the day of commemorating the Premier. Everyone should add a firm oath to our oath. The work of the congress has been completed. All comrades and compatriots should express the congress's external and internal policies in their respective duties and occupations. The country has reached a state of crisis that is imminent, and it did not start today. For decades, internal affairs, diplomacy, and even the various social situations have been in danger. The most heartbreaking thing is that after every major problem occurred in the past, there was no pain to think about it and no real effort to do real work to save the country and build real strength. Day by day, the causes of danger became deeper and deeper, until we encountered this national crisis of internal and external troubles, natural disasters, and man-made disasters at the same time. At this time, we must revitalize our spirit and strive forward, and at the same time, we must earnestly reflect. Now the task has been completed. We must sincerely and sincerely make our own determination and make a grand oath to the spirit of the Premier in heaven. In the future, we must supervise ourselves, lead our comrades, unite the people, and implement it to the end in our duties and occupations. Being loyal to our duties is the starting point for achieving the public spirit of the world and completing the revolutionary work. This point of meaning must be the same for everyone. I hope that in the future, we will lead all party comrades and compatriots in this spirit to love each other and fight to the end in good faith. The future Fifth National Congress will definitely be able to show the good results created by the united unity of all party comrades and compatriots. (Special dispatch from the 23rd)</p>

<h3 id="e22">Declaration of the Fourth Plenary Session <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The full text of the Declaration of the Fourth Plenary Session is as follows: Since the Third National Congress of the Party, two years and eight months have passed. During this period, what the Party and the people of the whole country have worked together to achieve is the construction of the tutelage period and the consolidation of the foundation of peaceful unification. However, obstacles have multiplied, and the Party and the country have suffered many misfortunes, causing immeasurable sacrifices to the people's livelihood and national strength. The work of tutelage has not been realized as expected. Until May of this year, the National Conference was convened to formulate the Provisional Constitution for the Period of Political Tutelage, which means that from now on, all citizens of the country and the Party shall be able to work together in accordance with the publicly established norms. When the national army was engaged in the suppression of the Red Bandits in Gan and E, the country encountered an unprecedented flood, with displacement and death all over the field, and the whole country cried out and devoted all its efforts to relief work. At this time, the tyrannical Japan took advantage of our crisis and carried out its invasion, forcibly occupied our land, massacred our people, bombed our cities, and colluded with traitors and bandits to destroy the integrity of our country with continuous acts of violence. The depth of the national crisis is extremely serious. The Congress was held during this period of serious national crisis, and it is believed that if our Chinese nation does not seek a way to survive with the determination to die, the nation will be plunged into eternal demise. If the comrades of the Party cannot unite and fully shoulder the heavy responsibility of saving the country and swear to lead the way, the revolutionary cause will be cut off from now on. In this autumn of crisis, we express our utmost sincerity in the basic essentials to our comrades and compatriots throughout the country.</p>
<p>The Premier said, "We must unite 400 million people into a large nation and build a strong and substantial country based on the Three Principles of the People in order to survive in today's world." The truth of saving the country lies only in this. Therefore, if we want to seek the unity of the whole country, we must first start with the real unity of the Party. Any country,</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>When the country is reviving and building, all the people's minds and the revolutionary central forces are firmly united, and there is no failure. On the contrary, there is no failure. Today, we will try to conduct a frank inspection. We dare to say that the people of the whole country's belief in the Three Principles of the People has not changed for a long time, but their expectations for the Party have gradually faded. This undeniable phenomenon is due to the scattered and separated signs within the Party, which are painful to the people, and also due to the failure of the comrades of the Party to win the love and respect of the people through arduous practical work. Now, when the national crisis is serious, it is an opportunity for self-reflection and self-redemption. The Congress takes the Premier's heart as its heart and the Premier's will as its will, eliminates all past alienation, and strives for the sincere unity of the Party. All our comrades should be of one mind and one heart, restore mutual trust, forgive each other for their faults, encourage each other for their hard work, follow the Premier's instructions to sacrifice freedom and contribute their abilities, create an unshakable spiritual unity, let our hair down and wear our crowns, and resist foreign aggression together. Then we can thank the people and relieve the national crisis. At the same time, we must also thoroughly examine the mistakes of past work, prevent the shortcomings of being scattered and following the old ways, attaching importance to form and neglecting practice, and take sacrifice as an advocate for the whole country at any time and place, take action as the first in the world, take loyalty to our duties as the only responsibility to implement the doctrine and achieve the purpose of saving the country and saving the people, establish the determination to give our lives in times of danger, and express the basic morality of revolutionaries. Then the people's respect for the Party will definitely become more and more intense, reversing the national destiny in times of danger, and expecting the realization of the doctrine. It is not the responsibility of others to turn misfortune into blessing. This is what the Congress is willing to tell our comrades in the Party. In modern times, the foundation of a country lies in the consolidation of unity and the enrichment of national strength. It also depends on the people's determination to be brave and enterprising, to establish a common belief and to work together to achieve it. The Premier's Great Program of National Construction and the Strategy of National Construction, which he left to us, are the highest principles for maintaining national survival. With painstaking efforts, we hope that our successors will succeed. However, for several years, the actual effectiveness of construction has not been obvious, and the increase in national strength is still rare. Recently, there has been an unprecedented foreign invasion. The Party is sincerely responsible for the failures of our compatriots to the Party. And what we will thank our country for in the future is only to do our best to sacrifice together with our compatriots to save the country and resist foreign aggression. We firmly believe that with the concerted efforts of our country, we will be able to overcome any difficulties and maintain the security of the country. Only our compatriots, who have shared the dangers of the country, will certainly be able to examine the great responsibility, respond to changes and resist foreign aggression. We must have the spirit of sacrificing individuals to preserve the whole group, and fundamentally, we must take action to create real strength. Looking at the history of various countries in the world, the traces of rising and revitalizing the old do not take extreme hardship, take double labor, and donate individual freedom and rights to contribute to the country's proposals. These arduous and arduous efforts to catch up are the spirit that our country must learn from. The Congress believes that the construction of the country in the future must start from the three aspects of military affairs, education, and economy, and make a thorough and vigorous transformation of both material and spiritual aspects, sweeping away the mentality of luck, creating a solid national defense, and ensuring the permanent survival of the nation. We earnestly hope that all our comrades in the Party will abide by the resolutions, work hard, unite our compatriots across the country, implement national mobilization, and complete the great task of our national construction with a consistent step and the greatest determination. The Congress firmly believes that the revitalization of the national spirit will be the most difficult time for the country. Only when the country is in the most difficult time can it fully express and test the national self-confidence. May all our compatriots and comrades throughout the country dedicate their loyalty and courage, concentrate under the Three Principles of the People, and make active preparations to save the country. Externally, we must defend against aggression, defend national rights, and strive for international justice and peace, and strive for the right to national survival and self-defense. The temporary gains and losses are not to be counted, and all sacrifices are not to be cherished. Humanity will not be destroyed, civilization will not be destroyed, and the final victory will belong to us. Internally, we must revitalize politics, strive for construction, move forward at the same time, and have no regrets, in order to establish the foundation for the permanent independence and self-reliance of the Chinese nation, which is also to maintain the permanent survival and prosperity of the Chinese nation. All our comrades should know that saving the country is to save the Party. All our compatriots throughout the country should be able to share the contribution of all our spiritual and material strength to obey the command of the central government, and there is no way to reverse the national crisis and fulfill the responsibility of saving the country. This is what we say. (Special dispatch from the 23rd)</p>

<p>Yan Huiqing's Remarks During Stopover in Jinan</p>
<p>(Jinan) Yan Huiqing passed through Jinan today on his way to Nanjing to receive instructions. After reading recent League of Nations telegrams, he will be able to set a date to go to the United States. The final League of Nations sanction against Japan is economic blockade, which is theoretically certain. However: 1. Due to the poor economic conditions of European countries after the war, they are expanding trade to try to recover, and they may not be able to afford to suffer considerable losses from an economic blockade against Japan for the sake of China. 2. The League of Nations itself has only been established for a few years, and its foundation is not solid. It can only issue fair theories on international affairs. Because of its insufficient strength, it cannot in fact blockade Japan. 3. International disputes between the strong and the weak are easier to resolve. However, when one is strong and one is weak, the League of Nations finds it quite difficult. If it cannot stop Japan this time, it will lose credibility, and the League of Nations may fundamentally shake because no one supports it. As for Japan's occupation of the Northeast, although it is complacent, it has suffered a great moral loss. Moreover, the troops it sent to the Northeast, it declares were only over 10,000, but it certainly did not send troops from within the country, only from Korea. Its actual strength is also limited and it seems it cannot have ambitions elsewhere. The United States signed the Nine-Power Treaty and is trying its best to help China, but as it is not a member of the League of Nations, it has difficulty speaking out. (23rd Dispatch)</p>

<p>Great Turmoil in Japanese Political Circles</p>
<p>安達內相仍固執成見</p>
<p>Adachi, the Home Minister, Still Adheres to His Views</p>
<p>聯合內閣無實現可能</p>
<p>No Possibility of a Coalition Cabinet</p>
<p>Japan Associated Press, Tokyo, 23rd: Home Minister Adachi's statement is like throwing a stone into the calm political sea, suddenly causing a great shock. Many in Japanese political circles are viewing the current cabinet as brewing a major crisis and are worried about its fate. Former Finance Minister Inukai, who had been touring Kyushu's hot springs for recuperation since mid-month, also arrived in Tokyo on the evening of the 21st. Amidst this political upheaval, Inukai's actions are attracting much attention.</p>
<p>Another Telegram: Home Minister Adachi conferred with party executives at his private residence today regarding a coalition cabinet, telling those around him that the only way to resolve the current difficult situation is to organize a coalition cabinet. My belief has not changed at all. Those who oppose the coalition cabinet must not be nationals. There are no prejudices between the Prime Minister and me. As for how to realize my ideals, we still need to calmly observe the development of the situation.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd: Since Home Minister Adachi issued his statement, the government and the party have been greatly shaken. Seiyukai Secretary-General Kuhara visited Saionji in Okitsu yesterday to inform him that Adachi's proposal to organize a coalition cabinet was to solve the current difficulties, and explained the Seiyukai's attitude, seeking Saionji's understanding. He returned to Tokyo the same evening and met with Inukai Tsuyoshi to report on the details of his meeting with Saionji. It is rumored that given the current situation of the Seiyukai and Minseito parties, this plan is likely difficult to achieve.</p>
<p>Another Telegram: Prime Minister Wakatsuki met with Home Minister Adachi yesterday. At 4 p.m. in the afternoon, he gathered cabinet ministers who were originally from the party at his private residence. The attendees included Finance Minister, Machida, Agriculture Minister, Koizumi, Communications Minister, Sakurada, Commerce Minister, Tanaka, and others. Wakatsuki reported on the results of his consultation with Adachi and still wanted to maintain the status quo and proceed actively according to the established policy. All cabinet members felt that it seems impossible to organize a coalition cabinet at the present time.</p>
<p>Japan Associated Press, Tokyo, 23rd: In order to stabilize the situation, Wakatsuki decided to convene a supreme meeting. After consulting with Secretary-General Kodō at his private residence today, he telegraphed Tomita, the Executive Advisor who was traveling in Atami.</p>

Furthermore, news has come from European cities such as Rome that they will greatly increase import taxes in the near future to resist Britain's protectionist tariffs.</p>

<p>Japanese Military Propaganda to Occupy Harbin</p>
<p>Damei Evening News, Harbin, 21st: Based on recent conversations between Japanese military officers, it seems that the Japanese army is not satisfied with occupying Qiqihar and is about to occupy Harbin. A certain newspaper here published a statement by Japanese Kwantung Army Commander Honjō, who reportedly said, "I am very troubled by the situation in Harbin. Therefore, there may be a need to dispatch troops to occupy it. I am closely observing Harbin. If there are disturbances that endanger the lives and property of Japanese residents, then I am prepared to send troops there." Since occupying Qiqihar and Changchun, the Japanese military's position allows it to quickly dispatch troops to Harbin when necessary. Furthermore, Japanese General Doihara also told this newspaper's (Damei Evening News) reporter last night that whether or not to send Japanese troops to Harbin is still uncertain, but that they will dispatch troops if necessary. Today, Japanese Consul General Ohashi protested to the local authorities about two matters: one was the boycott of Japanese goods, and the other was that Ding Chao, the Commander of the China Eastern Railway Protection Army, allowed scattered soldiers from Qiqihar to enter Harbin. However, Ohashi said that the situation in Harbin has improved somewhat on the whole since the Japanese military occupied Qiqihar. He hopes that it will not be necessary to send Japanese troops here. (Note: Harbin is the hub of the China Eastern Railway and has the power to control the northern part of the three northeastern provinces. If the Japanese military occupies it, then its infringement on Russian interests will become even more obvious. Therefore, this move is highly noteworthy in future Japanese-Russian relations.) According to the reporter's observation, the situation in Harbin is mostly in the hands of Zhang Jinghui. Zhang has always been known for being pro-Japanese. Since the Mukden Incident, Zhang has obtained a large number of guns and ammunition, reportedly all seized by the Japanese military from the Shenyang Arsenal. He is currently using these to train security forces, who are drilling diligently every day. If Zhang can use these security forces to control everything and indirectly serve the Japanese, then Japanese troops may not need to come. However, the local people, the Kuomintang, and other factions are opposing Zhang and unwilling to surrender. Therefore, the future of Harbin is still uncertain.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Tianjin Rioters Disturb Again <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Besides the Japanese Concession, Tianjin has been quite calm in recent days. All shops have reopened, and traffic has resumed. It is hoped that the city will return to its former state soon. However, yesterday around noon, a dozen or so thugs in the Xiguangkai and Caochang'an areas attempted to cause trouble. The authorities discovered this and sent security teams. The thugs fled at the sight of the teams. A temporary curfew was imposed yesterday afternoon, and the situation returned to normal after an hour. However, the Japanese have not slightly withdrawn their vigilance, and they have not returned the two districts and six police stations that they forcibly occupied. It is also reported that the Japanese warship "Kari" carrying more than 2,000 marines arrived at Tanggu, but could not sail to Tianjin due to shallow water. The marines, due to strict surveillance by various countries, could not disembark at Tanggu. They have now changed into civilian clothes, formed groups of three to five, and secretly arrived in Tianjin by car. They are expected to arrive in full force within the next few days. The latest situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Thugs Caused Disturbance for Half an Hour After the Chinese area of ​​the city implemented the withdrawal of defenses on the 18th at the request of the Japanese side, the serious atmosphere of war preparations in the Japanese Concession has never diminished. Late the day before, Japanese troops stationed at Haiguang Temple, Nan Shi Pai Lou and other places frequently fired live ammunition at the Chinese area to provoke incidents. At 12:10 noon yesterday (20th),</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>The Japanese side again incited more than 60 plainclothes thugs, divided into left and right routes, to go to the Xiguangkai Yan Hai Hui area to fire guns and cause disturbances. The 16th and 19th Squadrons of our security forces, upon hearing the news, went together to round them up. For a time, gunfire erupted, sounding like a string of pearls. The shopkeepers panicked and closed their doors one after another. After about twenty minutes, the thugs lost contact and scattered like birds and beasts. A pedestrian, about thirty years old, was shot and killed by a stray bullet near a certain lumberyard. Zhang Wenzong, a rickshaw puller, was also shot in the left leg by a plainclothes team, bleeding profusely. He was taken to the Municipal Hospital for treatment that day. The local authorities, in order to prevent them from taking advantage of the situation again, have increased police forces in the area to eliminate them. At the same time, the glass doors and windows of the police station in Caochang'an, Nanmalu, were also destroyed by thugs.</p>
<p>Temporary Curfew in the Chinese Area When the gunfire first broke out, it was at the time when the curfew was being lifted, and the pedestrians were like weaving. Upon hearing the alarm, there was great chaos. Hebei and various special districts then announced a temporary curfew to maintain order. The Jingang and Jintang Bridges were also temporarily raised. White and red牌 trams on all routes were therefore suspended. The Italian Concession authorities redeployed defensive works at all intersections and inspected pedestrians with extreme strictness. It was not until 3:00 p.m. that it was relatively safe, and traffic also resumed. However, in the Haiguang Temple area, gunfire could still be heard from time to time at 6:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Two Districts and Six Stations Not Returned The two districts and six police stations outside the Nanyingmen in our city have been forcibly occupied by Japanese military police since the night of the 8th, and two weeks have passed in an instant. Our authorities have repeatedly questioned the Japanese consul, but he has never responded. The authorities, concerned about sovereignty, specially sent Shen Dijia, the chief of the diplomatic section, to visit the Japanese consul, Kuwajima, the day before yesterday to ask when they would be returned. At that time, the Japanese consul could not answer and promised to consult with the commander of the garrison, Kashii, and then reply. Yesterday, Shen met with the Japanese consul again. According to his verbal reply, the two districts and six stations would be returned immediately, but he did not mention when or what time, apparently still using cunning tricks to perfunctorily deal with the matter.</p>
<p>Traffic in the Japanese Concession Still Cut Off The residents of the Japanese Concession, seeing that traffic in the Chinese area has fully recovered, held a meeting of the residents' group the day before yesterday to request the resumption of traffic on Asahi Street to maintain commerce. The Japanese consul agreed and drafted an announcement to resume traffic immediately. However, due to the opposition of the commander of the garrison, it was not implemented. It is reported that the Japanese consul consulted with the commander of the garrison, Kashii, yesterday about resuming traffic on Asahi Street and allowing trams to pass. Kashii has agreed, but trams are only allowed to run from the southeast corner to the Zhongyuan Company. South of the Zhongyuan Company, traffic is still not allowed, and tram passengers must be checked by the Japanese army before they can enter the concession. Therefore, there was still no result. Therefore, the earthworks and power grids in various parts of the Japanese Concession are still set up, and Japanese troops are still patrolling at the intersection of the Chinese and Japanese boundaries. Only the French-Japanese intersection at Lichiang can be passed at will from 12:00 noon to 4:00 p.m., but it must be inspected. After 4:00 p.m., the Japanese army will again take up positions. Every night, Japanese armored vehicles patrol the intersections, showing no sign of withdrawing their defenses.</p>
<p>Release Time Will Be Extended Since the plainclothes team was suppressed, our authorities, in order to facilitate merchants and people, have specially stipulated the release time to allow citizens to purchase daily necessities. It was originally scheduled from 10:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m., and then extended from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. The market has been calm in recent days. Although there are a few scattered thugs still hiding in remote areas, the authorities have taken strict precautions and have been arrested one after another. Therefore, the public security in the city can be guaranteed to be safe. The curfew headquarters decided yesterday that, starting today, the release time will be extended by another hour, changing it from 7:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. (21st)</p>

<p>Colluding with Bandits to Disturb Internal Security</p>
<p>While Loudly Advocating the Resolution of the Shandong Issue</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: This city was once occupied by the Japanese. Although it was decided by the Washington Conference to be recovered by our country, the Japanese ambition to plot Qingdao has not diminished. Recently, due to the Northeast Incident, the Japanese in Qingdao all believe that the time has come. They are secretly active, hoping to cause a major incident to plan for another invasion. A few days ago, they bought hundreds of hooligans, hoping to take the opportunity to cause trouble and create a second Tianjin. Fortunately, the authorities detected and arrested them, and the traitors were scattered, so nothing happened. However, the Japanese community was not dead set on selling the traitorous scheme. Yesterday (20th) afternoon at 3 o'clock, they held an implementation committee meeting in the Residents' Group. The arguments made by the Japanese in the meeting were extremely absurd, and some even advocated that their government should immediately occupy Qingdao. Finally, several items were decided, the important ones are about two points, (1) Thoroughly resolve the Shandong issue, (2) Re-invade the entire Shandong province, and send representatives to Tokyo, Osaka and other places to vigorously promote to the people of their country. In addition, it was also decided to raise a large amount of money and send people secretly to the inland of Shandong to collude with bandits and disrupt public security, which will be used as a pretext for sending troops to occupy Shandong in the future. Because the trouble in Qingdao failed, they plan to cause trouble elsewhere in the inland. It is also reported that a certain Tang came to Qingdao from the Eastern Province a few days ago, and his whereabouts are very secretive. It is said that it is not unrelated to the Japanese conspiracy. The authorities, according to reports, have been secretly monitoring his actions (21st)</p>
<h3 id="e62">The British Secret Proposal Reported by the Japanese Newspaper <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese Army Opposes This Case</p>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Denies This Matter</p>
<p>15th Japan: The Osaka Mainichi Shimbun disclosed a message saying that the United Kingdom has a secret proposal, which is agreed by the United Kingdom and the United States. After this news was published, many parties in Japan considered it a fact, but Shidehara resolutely denied it. Now the Paris Conference has become the focus of worldwide attention. In this tense atmosphere, the 16th when the League of Nations Council will be reopened is approaching. According to US Secretary of State Stimson, Japan's reply to the US is an extremely satisfactory and harmonious one. British opinion has recently seemed to be slightly better for Japan. So what is Japan's so-called harmonious attitude, and how is this situation caused? These two things are considered incredible by the world. The conspiracy and secret strategy of the United Kingdom have been very obvious. On the one hand, the United Kingdom supports the League of Nations, and on the other hand, it has the ambition to establish commercial rights in China. It wants to use the power of the League of Nations to oppress Japan by taking the Manchurian Incident as an opportunity. However, Japan did not yield, but instead showed a form of excitement. Therefore, the United Kingdom secretly proposed a proposal to Japan a few days ago, the terms of which are as follows: (1) The United Kingdom will hold the League of Nations Council on the 16th, with the main focus on maintaining the face of the League of Nations and Japan, and strive to solve the problem. (2) The United Kingdom will have the leader of the League of Nations speak and announce the claims made by the Japanese government on the 26th, that is, the articles centered on respecting treaties and protecting overseas Chinese, on the one hand, ask China to express its approval, and ask Japan to express its satisfaction with this approach, and immediately declare the withdrawal of troops within the Manchurian Railway. (3) Please Japan to suspend military operations in northern Manchuria, and also be careful in North China, and do not expand the dispute. (4) In order for the League of Nations Council to proceed smoothly, please Japan send Ambassador Matsudaira to Paris to contact the United Kingdom. The above proposal was not forwarded by the diplomatic organs of the United Kingdom, but was sent to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs by special means, and an understanding seems to have been established between the United Kingdom and the United States. Ambassadors Matsudaira and Yoshida then decided to go to Paris, revealing Stimson's so-called Japan's harmonious attitude. The British Foreign Secretary once declared in Parliament [seeking US assistance], and there was a Dawes-Matsudaira-Simon three-person London meeting. The secret documents exchanged by the three countries are the above four settlement proposals. The newspaper reported that the Japanese army opposed this case, while Shidehara denied it. Shidehara's speech said that the saying that a secret agreement was established between the United Kingdom, Japan and the United States before the League of Nations Council meeting was completely untrue. The Japanese government decided to follow the previously announced policy and attend the council meeting held in Paris on the 16th, that is, (1) direct negotiations between China and Japan, China recognizes the basic outline, and after the emotional Deputy and China and Japan, then conduct troop withdrawal negotiations, (2) wait until the Manchurian local government is established and public security can be ensured, then begin troop withdrawal, therefore the Japanese government does not need to reach an understanding with any country before the meeting. The British proposal, which was sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by special means without going through diplomatic organs, is also impossible. According to reports, the so-called British secret case is mostly unreliable, and judging from Shidehara's words, even if China recognizes its requirements, there is no talk of troop withdrawal, let alone implementing troop withdrawal. It can be seen that Japan's true intention is to occupy it factually and for a long time. Everything else is just embellishment.</p>

<p>Touting a National Unity Cabinet</p>
<p>Tokyo Correspondence: Time flies. A year has passed since Reijiro Wakatsuki was ordered to form a cabinet. The fate of the Wakatsuki cabinet during this year has been swaying in the harsh winds and bitter rains. The world's recession is getting deeper and deeper, Japan's domestic industries are gradually declining, and fiscal revenue has been greatly reduced. Recently, the sudden rise of the UK's turmoil has further triggered the uneasiness of the Japanese financial community. The gold standard is already in motion. The outbreak of the Shenyang Incident this time caused a direct conflict between the government and the military, and international public opinion is extremely difficult to grasp, so diplomacy has fallen into an abnormal state. Under this heavy pressure, a great crisis is inevitably lurking in the future of the Wakatsuki cabinet. In such a situation of diplomatic difficulty and financial difficulty, Genji Matsuda and other first-class figures in the political world, as well as those inside and outside the government and the party, have fully exposed their determination to [disbelieve] the current cabinet, and at the same time, they are eager to have a [national unity cabinet] appear in the near future to cope with the current difficulties.</p>
<p>Although there is no specific expression of the movement for this national unity cabinet, the recent busy visits of Mr. Matsuda and others to Wakatsuki and Prince Saionji imply a kind of active meaning. In addition, Mr. Matsuda and others' secret efforts to win over powerful people from the Minseito and Seiyukai seem to be a very obvious symbol.</p>
<p>Rumors are rife. Prime Minister Wakatsuki expressed some opinions at the beginning of the meeting with cabinet ministers and party members the day before yesterday (14th), intending to sweep away the rumors and rumors from the past. [The recent situation is indeed a difficult and eventful autumn, but to solve this difficult problem, it is really indispensable for the current cabinet. The [national unity cabinet] said recently chanted inside and outside the party, in addition to hindering the international credibility of the government, it is of no benefit to the country. We should strictly prohibit this kind of rash action, and at the same time, we must work hard to move forward and deal with the current major situation well, so that we can live up to the trust of the Emperor and comfort the expectations of the people].</p>
<p>At that time, the government and some of the parties were very confident that this speech would be effective, and could be used to dispel some of the unease in the current situation, but in fact, there seemed to be some room for doubt. (1) The elder statesmen have recently expressed extreme disappointment with Prime Minister Wakatsuki's attitude, and at the same time, in order to open up the current situation of turmoil, they intend to make the current cabinet step down. (2) Prime Minister Wakatsuki himself seems to have a sense of [running out of steam] for the current difficulties, and at the same time, he expects that he will not be able to pass the difficult hurdle when attending the recent parliament, so he has a considerable understanding of the organization of a coalition cabinet or a cooperative cabinet. (3) There are still some major unresolved conditions regarding the relationship with the military. (4) Matsuda and others, the central figures in the slight movement of the political situation, did not attend the懇談meeting on the 14th. From these relationships, Prime Minister Wakatsuki's speech may not have any effective effect in reality, and the fate of the Wakatsuki cabinet seems to be [the end of its rope].</p>
<p>In short, the movement for a national unity cabinet has already taken shape. After Interior Minister Adachi returns to Beijing on the 21st, it will definitely be more superficial. However, whether the life of the Wakatsuki cabinet will eventually be, and whether the coalition cabinet will die due to difficult childbirth, depends entirely on the changes in the international situation in the future, and the safety of the future situation in the Far East is entirely linked to the ebb and flow of this Japanese coup.

<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The Fourth National Congress of the Kuomintang convened in Guangzhou held its opening ceremony at 9:00 a.m. on the 18th at the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall on Dexuan Road. More than a thousand people from various military, political, party, and group representatives participated in the ceremony. Members of the Extraordinary Conference, such as Sun Ke, Xiao Focheng, Deng Zhiru, Chen Jitang, Li Zongren, Jing Hengyi, Deng Qingyang, Shi Qingyang, Li Wenfan, Chen Youren, Chen Ce, Liu Jiwen, Lin Yungai, Chen Shuren, Jiao Yitang, Zhang Zhiben, Fu Rulin, Bai Yunti, etc., and members of the Guangdong Provincial Government, Tang Shaoyi, and members of the Provincial and Municipal Governments, and members of the Provincial and Municipal Party Departments all participated. More than 700 representatives attended the Fourth National Congress. At 9:20, the opening ceremony was held, presided over by Sun Ke. After the ceremony, Sun delivered an opening speech, which mainly stated the reasons and tasks for the establishment of the Extraordinary Conference, and then stated that in order to solve the current crisis of the party and the country, the Extraordinary Conference specially hurried to convene the Fourth National Congress to make the central leading organs from temporary to official, and entrust the responsibility borne by a small number of people to the organs entrusted by the whole party. Originally, the mission of the Extraordinary Conference was to eliminate the communist disaster and overthrow the dictatorship. Unfortunately, neither of these two things was achieved. Suddenly, a strong neighbor came to oppress, and the national life was in danger. In order to accept the national people's request for unity, the Extraordinary Conference specially sent representatives to Shanghai last month to conduct peace talks. Regarding the convening of the Fourth National Congress, the Ning and Guangdong parties initially had their own claims. Finally, it was decided that the Fourth National Congress would be held separately in Ning and Guangdong with a spirit of cooperation. Since the Fourth National Congress had the claim of uniting comrades from the First, Second, and Third Congresses, the First Conference of the Fourth Central Executive and Supervisory Committee could fundamentally seek a solution to the party and government. The First Conference of the Fourth National Congress can be called the Unification Conference. At the First Conference of the Fourth National Congress, the responsibility of reorganizing the government should naturally be borne. There are many crises in the party and the country now. The comrades of the Fourth National Congress of our party should bear the responsibility of restoring the faith of our party. If our party has no way to do it after today, not only will the people's hope for the party be lost, but our party will also be difficult to continue to survive. We are opening the Fourth National Congress at this critical juncture, and its significance is more important than any previous Congress. The only responsibility in the future is to first engage in internal party unity, restore party rights, and rebuild revolutionary forces, and then we can secure the country and resist foreign aggression. Then Chen Jitang gave a speech, briefly saying that the opening of today's Fourth National Congress is a new opportunity for the party. If we want to restore the party's strength, we must first be united. The way to unite must be to establish [common trust], [mutual trust], [mutual understanding], and [mutual love]. If we can be united in spirit, then this department can be revived and developed. Regarding politics, we should overthrow the dictatorship and build a permanent civilian government. Regarding the economy, we should proceed according to the National Founding Strategy and the National Founding Outline. Regarding elections, comrades must stand in the party's position, seek talents for the party, and not have personal emotional effects. After the speech, the cannons were fired and the music was played, and the ceremony was completed. At 11:30, photos were taken and the meeting was adjourned. It was decided that a preparatory meeting would be held at 2:00 p.m. on the 19th. It was heard that the conference period would be set for ten days (November 18th evening)</p>

<p>After the Punishment of Traitorous Merchants Various Shapes and Colors Since the implementation of confiscating inferior goods in stores and punishing traitorous merchants and merchants' strikes by the People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of this county, the Anti-Japanese Association executed the punishment of traitorous merchants standing in wooden cages yesterday, and the situation has become more tense. In the past two days, only merchants related to inferior goods were on strike, and the doors were still plastered with strips of paper saying [Stop business, distinguish Japanese goods separately] and [Negotiate methods for distinguishing Japanese goods]. But starting this morning (22nd), all industries in the city were on strike. The paper strips written on the doors of the relevant industries have been torn off. If small merchants are found not to be on strike, they will be persuaded to stop business by their colleagues. As a result, the market has suddenly become desolate. Hundreds of merchants have gathered at the Chamber of Commerce, waiting for Zhu, the standing committee member and executive director of the representatives who went to the province to petition, to return to Yangzhou to report the results of the petition. It is also heard that the provincial party and government organs have assigned a committee member who will come to Yangzhou with Zhu and others to investigate the truth and resolve everything. However, each trade association, with Wang Jingting, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, attending the Anti-Japanese Association on behalf of the business community, was recommended to serve as a standing committee member. It is heard that the Anti-Japanese Association cannot accommodate Wang's representative to speak for the merchants, and specially sent a letter to the Anti-Japanese Association to withdraw the representative immediately, and stated that the business community will not send representatives to attend future meetings. It is also known that there were slogans found in the streets and markets this morning that were written by merchants who were wronged, [Chairman Wang secretly used conspiracy and did not strive for the wronged people with the Anti-Japanese Association, but allowed them to be slaughtered, and did not sincerely act as the master for the merchants], etc. In addition, Zhou Liren and other shop assistants of the cloth industry, because the owners were affected by the sealing of inferior goods, were afraid that the economic turnover would not be活, and they would not be able to resolve the strike. They were afraid that if the business was suspended, the labor would have no means of living. Therefore, all the shop assistants held a meeting today and decided to petition the Chamber of Commerce to quickly seek a solution. Regarding the inferior goods of the industry, they requested that the shop assistants be allowed to seal them up on behalf of the owners, and prohibit them from continuing to import them. If the owners are found to be secretly importing them again, the labor will report to the Chamber of Commerce and forward them to the Anti-Japanese Association for punishment. In order to prevent the labor and the capital from colluding, the labor is allowed to expel the person involved from membership, and prohibit them from serving in the 塲 forever.</p>

<h3 id="e71">Jiangsu Province: Middle School Education Fee Issue <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>The Important Reason for Financial Strain</p>
<p>Remedial Measures by the Executive Committee</p>
<p>Bearing the Pain in the Face of National Crisis</p>
<p>The Executive Committee of the Jiangsu Provincial Middle School Teachers' Association sent a letter to various provincial schools, stating: "Regarding the fact that since the beginning of the academic year, almost four months have passed, and only half a month's worth of education fees have been issued, we, who were hired, are not responsible for raising funds. However, those in administrative positions neglect their duties and only know how to be officials, not how to do things. Who else is affected by this besides us? Investigating the reasons for the financial strain on education fees, the important reasons are as follows: (1) The Ministry of Finance has not repaid any of the debt. Before 1927, the cigarette tax revenue was used for Jiangsu Province's education fees. Since 1927, the cigarette tax revenue has been returned to the Ministry of Finance, and 1.8 million yuan was allocated from the land tax to offset this, with an agreement at the time that any shortfall would be made up by the Ministry of Finance. However, since 1927, there has been an annual shortfall of about 600,000 yuan, and the cigarette tax rate has been increased year by year. Over the past four years, the total shortfall in land tax has been more than 2.5 million yuan. Despite repeated demands, the Ministry of Finance ignores them. This is one reason. (2) Unreasonable occupation of National Central University's funding. The annual expenditure for National Central University is 1.32 million yuan, accounting for about half of the province's education fees. However, according to the budget expenditure standards promulgated by the National Government's Accounting Office in 1930, it is clearly stipulated that the funding for national schools should be paid by the state, and the land tax should be allocated for local use. Furthermore, the slaughter tax is designated as a local tax. Therefore, the funding for National Central University should undoubtedly be paid by the national treasury. In addition, Jiangsu Province suffered a major flood this year, and tax revenue has decreased sharply. The province's own schools are on the verge of running out of funds, making it even more difficult to bear the expenses of national schools. For several years, despite the association's efforts to stop the payments, the committee refused to sign. As of the beginning of this month, the Jiangsu Education Fee Committee held its 26th meeting and still decided to allocate the Ministry of Finance's recent subsidy of 600,000 yuan to National Central University, while the remaining 720,000 yuan would still be provided by Jiangsu Province, an illegal occupation. This is the second reason." On November 18th, the Jiangsu Provincial Education Fee Committee held its 26th meeting at the Education Department to discuss remedial measures. Here is a record of what was heard at the time: "(A) The annual education fee for the entire province is about 4.8 million yuan, and the old debt is about 800,000 yuan, totaling 5.6 million yuan. (B) (1) Ministry of Finance subsidy: 600,000 yuan (2) New subsidy: 600,000 yuan (already used by National Central University) (3) Provincial government subsidy: 300,000 yuan (4) New provincial government subsidy: 300,000 yuan (half of the Shata income) (5) School accommodation fees: 200,000 yuan (6) Education Management Office loan: 300,000 yuan (7) Actual receipt: 2.5 million yuan (8) Issuance of public bonds: about 600,000 yuan, totaling 5.6 million yuan. If the above subsidy measures can be fully implemented, it may not be a method of relief. However, whether this can be achieved in reality is still a very big question. Now, the funding is in arrears for three months, and what will happen in the future is unknown. However, in this time of national crisis, we have to temporarily bear the pain. Regarding the resolution of the 9th Representative Congress to convene an all-powers representative conference of various schools by the Executive Committee when necessary, we will observe the national situation and then determine our course of action. We hope to receive your valuable insights. This is addressed to the Middle School Teachers' Association for your perusal."</p>

<p>Declaration to the National Compatriots: Forwarded by various newspapers to the national compatriots for their consideration: Since the Japanese invaders' atrocities on September 18th, the government has abandoned its duty to defend the country and protect the people, repeatedly retreating and yielding to the enemy. All members of our association, filled with righteous indignation, went to Beijing to petition for resisting the enemy and avenging our humiliation in late September. We were fortunate to receive President Chiang's reply that the lost territories would be recovered in the shortest possible time, and he declared that if the Japanese invaders advanced further, he would fight with all his strength. Today, Heilongjiang Province has fallen, and Tianjin City is being disturbed. The Japanese invaders are becoming more ferocious, and the League of Nations is in despair. The government has violated its promise and has not shown any actual troop deployment. Now, our association is heartbroken and feels that the country's demise is imminent. Therefore, we have instructed students from various schools to fill out voluntary forms and organize groups to go to Beijing on this auspicious day to represent the will of all Shanghai students and urge the government to send troops immediately. This mission is extremely important. The delegation to Beijing will maintain a highly disciplined spirit and a firm attitude. Before the government shows actual troop deployment, the delegation, entrusted by all Shanghai students, will not leave Beijing without permission. Regardless of wind, rain, hunger, or cold, we will not waver. The students remaining in Shanghai will all go on strike and work hard in other ways to support them. We hope that national compatriots will recognize our sincere intentions and rise up to help us. The future of the nation truly depends on it. Jointly declared by the Shanghai University Students Anti-Japanese National Salvation United Association.</p>

Representatives from 19 schools, including Labor, Chizhi, China Public, Jiaotong, Tongji, East Asia Physical Education College, Shanghai Fine Arts College, Datong, Fazheng, Jinan, Guanghua, Sino-French, China University Business College, Soochow, Fudan, Music College, Daxia, Hujiang, and Shanghai Law School, attended. President Li of Jiaotong University chaired the meeting and passed resolutions on the declaration (see below), telegram to Shi Zhaoji urging to prioritize troop withdrawal, and the organization of a lecture tour and a national university joint association. The meeting adjourned at 6:30 PM.</p>
<p>Declaration: The faculty and staff of the Shanghai University Joint Association rarely discuss politics on ordinary days. However, with a strong enemy pressing on the border and the country in imminent danger, the government authorities, in terms of military affairs, fold their arms and sit idly by, watching the fall of the Northeast; in terms of diplomacy, trust in the natural changes of the League of Nations; and in terms of internal affairs, the realization of a unified government is nowhere in sight. All three of these points are related to the survival of our country and nation. We have to discuss them with our countrymen to the best of our understanding. Recently, Provincial Chairman Ma Zhanshan defended against the violence with a lone army, washing away the shame of the fleeing armies of Liaoning and Jilin. His reputation spread, and the whole country was moved. However, he eventually abandoned Longjiang due to a lack of supplies and support. Our country raises an army of two million, spending 28 million yuan per month, but those who hold military power value their own territories, are indifferent to the suffering of others, and do not care about them. The war against Russia on the Middle East Railway is clear evidence of this. Now that the three northeastern provinces have fallen, the commander-in-chief of the military forces has only begun to talk about going north. We believe that it is the duty of soldiers to resist the enemy when they come, and they should act promptly without hesitation. As for deploying defenses and raising funds, they have not had time to borrow them, even after two months. Going to the rescue today is already too late. Not going today is deceiving the people and selling out the country. This is the first point regarding military affairs. Representative Shi Zhaoji has tried his best to mediate, but his instructions are actually within the country. When the League of Nations adjourns, it is the time for our country to calmly discuss and resolve internal disputes, without having time to pay attention to others. Looking back at Japan, Uchimura resigned from his post in the United States, and Matsudaira lobbied in England. When the meeting reopens, the odds are set. Compared to them, we are naturally inferior. Now that the League of Nations has failed to reconcile, and the violent Japanese continue to advance, we did not start the conflict, so why talk about a truce? The Japanese conspiracy has been completely exposed, so what is the use of investigation? As for not ordering the Japanese to withdraw their troops and sending an investigation team first, and expanding the scope of the investigation, our country should reject them all. Our country should especially quickly and decisively invoke Articles 15 and 16 of the League of Nations Covenant, present them to the League of Nations, and quickly impose further sanctions to urge Japan to withdraw its troops, and formally appeal to the signatory countries of the Washington Treaty to support public opinion. This is the second point regarding diplomacy. Comrades of the Kuomintang are fighting and scolding each other, cutting themselves off from the masses, but the masses still cannot bear to abandon them. When the Unity and Peace Conference was held in Shanghai, we thought that the comrades could truly repent of their mistakes, unite, forgive the past, and plan for the future, calling for success and establishing a unified government immediately to appease the country and resist foreign aggression. Who knew that after more than ten days of turmoil, the result was only a four-plenary session that separated the two regions. This is the bitter intention of the comrades in the party who are unwilling to openly break up. At this time, we cannot demand too much, but we ask the comrades in both regions to work together, quickly eliminate all prejudices, limit the organization of a unified government, to appease the masses. A promise is worth a thousand pieces of gold, and the hope of extinction. This is the third point regarding internal affairs. All three of these points are major issues, and other matters will not be discussed in detail today. At this time, when internal and external troubles are pressing on us, the national sentiment is indignant and high, and the four peoples have suspended their studies and are running around to find a way to survive. This is what is proper and reasonable, and no laws can prohibit it. If those who hold the reins of power, give a loud call and rise up to resist foreign aggression, taking the will of the people as their own will, then the people will follow closely, like a shadow, without having to seek the peace of the people, and the people will be peaceful by themselves, without having to seek the trust of the people, and the people will trust by themselves. Having gained the trust of the people, to unanimously resist foreign aggression, what is there to fear from foreign enemies? Why are the people so fond of Ma Zhanshan, but willing to help him, because he can defend the country and resist foreign aggression and trust him. As for the fundamental plan, it lies in education. We are willing to share the responsibility with the government, and once the situation has stabilized, we will contribute our humble opinions for consideration. We hereby declare.</p>

Pan Yangyao of the center first gave an opening speech, followed by a speech by Du Chongyuan, manager of the Liaoning Zhaoxin Ceramics Company. Manager Du said that saving the country lies not in empty words, but in strength; not in激昂奋发, but in immersing oneself in practical work. He also recounted his personal experience in running an industry and fighting against the Japanese ceramics industry for the past eight years. His words were insightful and valuable. Next, Master Huang Zixiong, who had just returned from France, gave a lecture on the inside story of the League of Nations, believing that the League of Nations was not reliable, and that the only thing to rely on was one's own efforts. Everyone present was moved.</p>

<p>—Result: 42 to 37—</p>
<p>(A) Qingguang Wins Dares-to-Die…28 to 17</p>
<p>(B) Rowing Wins Eagle Team…48 to 31</p>
<p>Three West Qing basketball games were played last night. The game between John and Jiangwan was the most intense and interesting. At the end of regulation time, each team had 33 points, and they were tied. In overtime, John's Hou Xuemin made repeated contributions and defeated Jiangwan 42 to 37 to win the final victory. In the other two games, Qingguang defeated Dares-to-Die 28 to 17, and Rowing defeated Eagle Team 48 to 31.</p>
<p>Qingguang Wins Dares-to-Die: The competition between the two teams was like fighting, with no artistry at all. Qingguang had 13 points in the first half, and Dares-to-Die had 8 points. In the end, Qingguang won 28 to 17. The referee was Lu Zhongen.</p>
<p>John Wins Jiangwan: After the start of the game, Jiangwan scored two goals in a row. John fought hard, and Hou Xuemin scored two goals back. Soon, they won 7 to 6. Jiangwan's military appearance was neat and their work was intense. They once took the lead with 17 to 12. John boosted his spirit and tried to advance. Hou Xuemin gave an outstanding performance, leaping up and shooting with one hand, turning around, and scoring every time. His posture was beautiful and showed great skill. In the first half, they turned the tables and won 18 to 17 against Jiangwan. A few minutes into the second half, the score became 20 to hand. After that, the scores went back and forth, and it was difficult to tell who was superior. Jiangwan led by one or two points for a long time. After 30 to 28 (Jiangwan in front), John's Chen Xianglong dribbled the ball in the middle, and Hou Xuemin rushed up and scored two goals in a row, and the score leaped ahead. By the time the time ran out, it was 33 to 33. Therefore, overtime was played. John's Hou Xuemin scored a goal first, and Fudan's Cheng Mingjue scored two points, making it 35 again. After that, John's momentum greatly increased, and Hou Xuemin repeatedly scored skillfully, winning thunderous applause from the audience. In the final result, John won 42 to 37.</p>

<p>— Yanzi</p>
<p>The Sino-Japanese War of Jiawu took place in the Yellow Sea. Naval Admiral Ding Ruchang was originally a veteran general of the Huai Army under Li Hongzhang. The navy was not his area of expertise. Li knew this, so he hired the German General Hanneken with a large sum of money to assist him. When the fleet was preparing to set sail, it included over twenty ships such as the Zhenyuan, Dingyuan, Pingyuan, Jiyuan, Weiyuan, Jingyuan, Zhiyuan, Laiyuan, Yangwei, Chaoyong, Jingyuan, Caojiang, Jieshun, Guangyi, and Guangnei. Ding nominally held the title of commander, but all orders were issued by Hanneken alone. Hanneken's assistants were two Germans, one Englishman, and one Italian. They were all famous Western naval artillerymen, and every shot hit the target. None of the Japanese ships escaped being hit by shells. Unfortunately, the Chaoyong, Yangwei, and Zhiyuan of the Qing Navy were too small in tonnage and slow in speed, causing them to be circled out of the formation by the Japanese ships and unable to coordinate. The Japanese ships, smaller than the Dingyuan, Zhenyuan, and Pingyuan, could not get close. They used all their firepower to bombard the smaller ships such as the Zhiyuan, Yangwei, and Chaoyong. After four hours of battle, the Chaoyong was sunk by a shell. The Yangwei caught fire after being hit. The deck of the Zhiyuan was completely destroyed. Commander Deng Shichang planned to use full speed to ram a Japanese ship, but he failed to achieve his goal and sank into the waves. Deng's death was the most heroic. Hanneken raised the flag and fired the cannons, fighting tirelessly. His eardrums were shattered, causing him to lose his hearing. Eight or nine of the Japanese ships were damaged. By dusk, they gathered their fleet and retreated. The Qing Navy also retreated to Liugong Island. Being unable to receive reinforcements, Ding Ruchang committed suicide by hanging himself. Hanneken, who had taken over Ding's authority, surrendered to the Japanese because the ships were damaged and ammunition was exhausted, following Ding's last wishes. However, Hanneken remained unyielding. He negotiated with the Japanese chieftains, stipulating that Qing prisoners of war should not be mistreated and should be sent back to their hometowns. He escorted Ding's coffin back to China, bidding farewell in Shanghai with tears. People at the time praised his righteousness.</p>
<p>Removing the Courtyard Grass: A Miscellany of Idle Talk</p>
<h3 id="e93">Watching the Battle <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Why did Qiqihar fall? It was because one general fought while the others watched, one province fought while the whole country watched! If we want to save China, we must first save the Three Eastern Provinces; if we want to save the Three Eastern Provinces, we must first save Heilongjiang. We must infuse the total strength of the whole country from a position of watching to the battlefield on the front lines. To hold military power and not save when defeat is imminent is to betray the Republic! If you have a pound of strength or a dollar in your pocket and are unwilling to help Ma Zhanshan defend against the enemy, you cannot be considered Chinese. The survival of a country is not accidental. When there are many people fighting and few people watching, even a small country can survive. When there are many people watching and few people fighting, even a large country can hardly escape destruction. We must use iron and blood to write a new history. If we only want to use our ears and eyes to listen to other people's stories and read other people's records, then we are not making much progress. A few days ago, I wrote a poem about watching the battle. Now I disclose it, wishing to work with the people of the country to eradicate this attitude of watching from the sidelines.</p>
<p>(The younger brother goes into battle, the older brother watches;</p>

<h3 id="e94">Li Hongzhang After the Sino-Japanese War of Jiawu <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>— Qing Guan</p>
<p>In the Sino-Japanese War of Jiawu, Ye Zhichao, Wei Rugui, Ding Ruchang, and Zuo Baogui were initially defeated at Yashan and then again at Pyongyang. Some died, some fled, and though they were incapable of handling military affairs, they ultimately led to the loss of troops and the sinking of ships. However, the Qing court repeatedly issued edicts to demote, remove, and arrest them in order to demonstrate rewards and punishments. Only when it was unavoidable did they appoint Vice Minister Zhang Yinhuan and Governor Yue Youlian to negotiate peace. The Japanese refused because they were not plenipotentiaries. Therefore, Li Hongzhang was reappointed as a plenipotentiary minister and ordered to go. He arrived in Maguan and held meetings with the Japanese Prime Minister Ito Hirobumi and Foreign Minister Mutsu Munemitsu at Shunpanro. Hirobumi smiled and said to Li, "[Since our last meeting, ten years have passed, and China has not changed at all, which has led to today's situation.]" Li was greatly ashamed. When the negotiations began, Li requested a ceasefire. Hirobumi demanded Dagu, Tianjin, and Shanhaiguan as collateral. Li protested, but he refused to agree. Suddenly, an assassin named Koyama Toyotaro emerged from the meeting place and shot Li in the left cheek. He was seriously injured. When the shocking news spread, the European and American powers were indignant and expressed their disapproval. Fearing this, the Japanese began to allow a ceasefire. Thus, Li's struggle was commendable, and the protests from the great powers were not entirely unable to weaken the arrogant spirit of that small island nation at the time.</p>
<p>At that time, it was the third month of the twenty-first year of the Guangxu reign (1895). The treaty was concluded, which is known as the Treaty of Shimonoseki. Domestic sentiment was turbulent, and Li was universally denounced for not being able to negotiate effectively. The cession of territory and the payment of indemnities were a disgrace to his mission. Within a month, more than a hundred memorials were submitted, almost making him the target of public criticism. Jiang Governor Liu Kunyi, Liang Governor Wang Wenshao, and Hubei Governor Zhang Zhidong strongly impeached him, requesting that Li be handed over to the Ministry of Justice for punishment to appease the people. The Qing court then clearly explained the reasons for handling the matter and the difficulties faced with Japan, and announced it to the country. Later, Li often said to people, "[I never thought that Xiangtao, as an official until today, still holds the views of a scholar,] causing him to stroke his beard repeatedly. However, Li also once sighed and said, "[I am not to blame for the Jiawu peace negotiations. If the Qingyi Garden had not been changed to the Summer Palace that day, spending 12,000 taels of silver daily, and instead that money had been allocated to the naval budget for the Western Empress's enjoyment, then the ships and artillery of the Beiyang Navy could have surpassed those of the world's powers. How could we have suffered such a defeat?"]" This old man was indeed well-versed in the times and was not willing to betray the country. At that time, he was even posthumously labeled a traitor and condemned by thousands of people, yet he still could not escape such criticism. In the past, Liang Rengong said, "[In the past two hundred years, our country has only had two diplomats named Li,]" (Liang wrote a biography of the two Lis). During the Taiping Rebellion era, there was only Li Xiucheng, and during the Sino-Japanese War, there was only Li Hongzhang. His words were indeed appropriate. Apart from these two men, it would be difficult to find anyone better. Alas, may those who bear the mission and negotiate on the international stage not cause people today to lament the past and future generations to lament the present.</p>
<h3 id="e95">The First Big Deal That Made the Japanese Prosperous <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Yi</p>
<p>I happened to flip through an old book and discovered the first big deal that made the Japanese prosperous. This deal involved plundering gold, silver, treasures, silks, and ornaments, totaling eighty large ships.</p>
<p>This occurred during the regency of Empress Jingu, around 201 AD, more than 1,700 years ago. Initially, Emperor Chuai's campaign to suppress the Kumaso (a state in Japan) rebellion failed, and he died.</p>
<p>Empress Jingu then rose to power and assumed the regency. She received two strange omens. One was a vow made while fishing on the Matsuura coast, saying that if a fish could be caught with a grain of rice, then every attack would be invincible. As a result, she actually caught a fish. The other was while washing her hair by the sea, praying that if her hair naturally split into two strands after washing, she would be victorious. As it turned out, her hair did split into two strands. Therefore, without hesitation, she abandoned the Kumaso and built large ships, shouting to her children to all attack Korea together.</p>
<p>At that time, Korea was divided into several states. Silla was located in Busan, closest to Japan. However, the strait separating Korea and Japan at that time was not as close as it is now. The Japanese only knew that the state of Silla was west across the sea, but they did not have a clear understanding of its exact location. Guided by fishing boats and directed by compasses, they first discovered the Flying Island and then saw indistinct mountains. Finally, through their faith, they reached the real state of Silla. The state of Silla at that time had never known that there were people to the east. Suddenly, they saw many large ships and many Japanese, thinking that they must have descended from the sky. They were caught off guard and, like the current policy of non-resistance, offered a white flag, presented treasures, and opened the gates to surrender. They even vowed to be vassals forever, never to rebel, unless the river flowed backward and the stones in the river rose to the sky. They also hung bows and arrows on the surrender building and sent their sons and more than eighty ministers to Japan. As a result, the Japanese not only obtained eighty large ships full of stolen goods but also received annual tributes and annual visits from the King of Silla. The Kumaso rebellion in their own country was suppressed without a campaign. From then on, the Japanese state prospered. It is said that this event was strange, but looking at the Shenyang Incident, it is not strange at all.</p>

<p>It has long been possible to take natural-color photographs with color high-speed cameras. However, the procedures are complicated and the costs are too high. Recently, there is some good news: British photographers have made another surprising new invention. People can now take color photos with procedures as simple and costs as low as taking black-and-white photos. The area of this color camera is not much larger than that of an ordinary handheld camera, and its price will not exceed five or six pounds. Each camera has three types of glass slides: red, yellow, and blue. The light in the lens is evenly reflected on each glass slide. Three dry plates are immediately taken, but these are ordinary plates. Even the developing procedure is the same as usual. However, these dry plates are stacked on a specially made photosensitive paper, which contains all the secrets. In just three minutes, a color photo can be printed, and the cost of each sheet of paper is less than three pennies. Each set of dry plates can be used to print countless color photos, and even the developing procedure can be avoided. It is said that this new invention will soon appear on the market.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Re-mentioning National Humiliation Evokes Suzhou Memories <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— Li Xufan</p>
<p>Our country's greatest pain from Japanese aggression began with the Jiawu War. In addition to ceding Taiwan, destroying the Dagu forts, and paying a military indemnity of 400 million yuan, the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang were designated for the opening of concessions (Suzhou, at the time, was still a provincial capital under Wu County). The Japanese official sent to Suzhou to discuss the land for the concession, whose name I no longer remember, came at the behest of the Japanese government. At the time, Governor Lu Chuanlin was still known for his integrity. He, along with local gentlemen Lu Runxiang and Yu Quyuan, jointly discussed the location. Although Yu was from Deqing, he had lived in Suzhou for a long time and his literary reputation was widespread. He was known as a talented scholar, so he was also among the gentry who were able to participate in foreign affairs. Moreover, many people sought Yu Quyuan's guidance, benefiting from his influence. The Japanese official happened to be one of them. Yu was therefore highly regarded by the authorities. However, his vision was sharp and his character was upright, far from being comparable to the traitors of the time. Lu had joined the Grand Council, but he was on leave at home. He was also known for his integrity. During the discussions, the Japanese had repeatedly invaded our territory since the Tang Dynasty, so there was some dissatisfaction. In the end, a corner of Qingyang land outside Panmen was allocated to them. (At the time, Suzhou only had six gates: Changxu, Pan, Lou, Qi, and Feng). The Japanese, because of Jin Changminhua, initially insisted on surveying land outside Changmen. Yu then quoted a Tang poem, "[Past Changmen, the road to Panmen, a weeping willow, a painted pavilion,]" to prove the history of Qingyang Minhua. He also said that the area was adjacent to the Suzhou customs, a necessary area for navigation between Suzhou and Shanghai, and it would be appropriate to open a commercial port there. The Japanese official was indeed well-versed in Tang poetry and styled himself as elegant, so he signed the contract for the Qingzhi land. However, although the area was opened as a concession, Suzhou capitalists did not invest in building there. The roads built by the Japanese were only for the use of horse-drawn carriages. Later, Lu Runxiang proposed opening a road between Changxu to promote the market. The local people enthusiastically supported it. Within two years, the Qingyang market was not completed, but the connection of Changxu Road recalled the red dust of ten miles. Following that, the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway line designated the intersection of Changqi as a station, and the prosperity of Suzhou was concentrated in Jin Chang. From then on, Qingyang became desolate, with bronze camels, thorny bushes, and creeping grass. Whenever it was between spring and summer, only the chaotic calls of birds could be heard. On autumn and winter nights, only fireflies could be seen. The Japanese, seeing that there was no profit to be made, did not invest much. To this day, only one agency is set up there, with a few policemen stationed. Therefore, in the past thirty years, there have been few overseas Chinese residents, and although they have an aggressive ambition, the effect is still equal to zero. Moreover, because it is our inland territory, they cannot legally carry out狡計 as they do in Tianjin and Hankou. Recalling the past and thinking about the present, we must give credit to Yu, Lu, and other wise predecessors.</p>
<h3 id="e98">A True Account of Zhang Xuegu Returning to the Truth <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— Ma Xiezong</p>
<p>Modern discussions about women who embrace spinsterhood are always met with mixed opinions. Those who criticize them say that they are violating human nature. Those who praise them say that they are female heroes. However, the morals of today's world are declining. Young women call licentiousness freedom and consider promiscuity to be love. Chastity has not been valued for a long time. To find someone who guards their body like jade and is unwavering in their devotion is as rare as a phoenix feather or unicorn horn. Therefore, Zhang Xuegu's character is worthy of emulation.</p>
<p>Xuegu's surname is Zhang, and she is also known as Xuebao. She is from Song Shijiabang, south of Cai Town, in Pudong North. In her youth, she vowed never to marry, guarding her body like jade. Throughout her life, she worshiped Catholicism and was highly respected by those in the faith. She was enthusiastic about charity and generous in giving. She paid particular attention to educational causes. Her niece, Ms. Zhang Qinde, founded the Qinde Girls' School in the west of the city, which has lasted for twenty years. Xuegu provided her with great assistance. Every winter, she would take out her savings to help the poor. Even if she emptied her purse, she would not be stingy. Therefore, the poor and helpless were all grateful for her kindness. She was so happy to do good. Unfortunately, she contracted a minor illness this autumn and passed away. Those who knew her lamented the loss of the elderly woman. She lived to be eighty-one years old, remaining chaste throughout her life, never marrying. She is truly a complete woman. The memorial service for the chaste woman will be held on the fourteenth. Many well-known people from all walks of life have sent tributes. My close friend Mr. Xu Xingchu and I presented a silk banner with the four words "Yaodao Guizhen" (Returning to Truth on the Jade Island). In the educational world, Ms. Jiang Xiutan, Ms. Shen Junfei, Mr. Sun Xiao, Ms. Lu Xiuqing, and Ms. Li Yajie also presented gifts and personally attended the funeral. On that day, in Song Shijiabang, white cars and white horses were at their peak. Dark clouds and rain created a desolate atmosphere. Heaven and earth were filled with sorrow, mourning the sinking of a star in the constellation of Bao Yu. (Moved for disaster relief)</p>

<h3 id="e99">The Country Bumpkin Goes to Shanghai Again (26) <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>The country bumpkin remembered buying a gong: It turned out that bandits in the country towns had recently been harassing various places. Large groups of bandits entered places as if they were no man's land, kidnapping people for ransom. They did not treat receiving the God of Wealth and 接觀音 as important. The public security bureau police teams sent from the city were somewhat unfair, insecure, unalert, and unobservant, often extorting them. The country bumpkins had no choice but to prepare some weapons for self-defense, gather some strong men, and resist the bandits when they came. They also knew that the doctrine of non-resistance was the most humiliating thing for mankind. They also had to prepare several very loud gongs. If bandits came, someone would see them and quickly strike the gong. As soon as there was an alarm, the sound of gongs would ring throughout the village, and all the villages would respond. The strong men from each village and town would rise up and resist the bandits. At that time, this country bumpkin was sent to Wang Dongwen's copper shop in Suzhou City to buy gongs. The louder the gong, the better, so that when it was struck, the whole village could hear it.</p>
<p>What is a conch? He had never heard of it before, and there was no dish with that name on the menu. The waiter also couldn't explain it clearly. Moreover, that kind of fresh conch was very expensive. He guessed that this country bumpkin couldn't afford that kind of expensive dish, so he didn't offer that dish anymore. Perhaps he could understand some of the more common dishes. [Char siu? Would you like some?] The waiter thought, this is the most common dish in our Cantonese restaurant. [Is there a "chai shao" here?] The country bumpkin misunderstood again and was very surprised.</p>
<p>He had long heard that there were so-called "chai shao" gangs in Shanghai, who were extraordinarily fierce. When they saw that someone had some money, they would come to "chai" your "shao." Someone said: This group of "chai shao" gangs are hooligans. The two words "chai shao" mean "facility". The country bumpkin had a friend tell him the last time he came to Shanghai: [Shanghai is not easy to handle, there are too many hooligans who specialize in extortion for a living. There are small hooligans and big hooligans, creating such a hooligan world in Shanghai.] The country bumpkin said: [I'm not afraid! They want to extort people, but it's always because that person has some money, so they think about him. I am a country bumpkin, I have nothing, they can't extort anything from me either.]</p>
<p>But that friend still warned him, saying: [Of course! You are not a rich person and do not have the qualifications to be extorted. But there are also many small hooligans in Shanghai. They see that you are a country bumpkin who has just arrived and has a rustic look. They can use even the smallest thing as an excuse to "chai" your "shao". Do you know that in Shanghai, someone will come to "chai shao" if you set up a stall; someone will come to "chai shao" if you buy something cheap: someone will come to "chai shao" if you walk on the road for no reason. These are all small "chai shao", but you still have to be careful.]</p>
<p>The country bumpkin kept this in mind. Today, when he heard the waiter ask him if he wanted "cha shao", he misheard it as "chai shao", so how could he not be alarmed?</p>

<h3 id="e100">Fluctuating Financial and Gold Markets Trend Upward <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>The trend is tortuous, resulting in a good start of nineteen taels. Yesterday's gold price continued to reach a peak, with a complex situation and frequent fluctuations. The total was twenty-five or six taels. In retrospect, it eventually rose by more than twenty taels. Buyers were excited, and there were too many short sellers, so the price rose sharply when they covered their positions. The intentions of the industry were very firm. The initial weakness of the previous market was due to the sudden rise in the pound sterling, but major buyers were very eager to buy, as if the exchange rate was clearly flat but secretly tight, and foreign firms were still actively buying. The price immediately rose by more than ten taels. Later, rumors spread about turmoil in the Japanese cabinet and possible restrictions on cash exports. As a result, sellers in the market suddenly became active, causing the price to fall sharply from 678 taels to 556 taels. Later, the foreign exchange market was extremely tight, and those hedging tried hard to cover their positions. The pound sterling had already narrowed to within nine pence, and the US dollar was trading at 32.5 yuan. Optimism prevailed on the stock exchange, and the market was poised to rise sharply, suddenly reaching the border of 80 taels, marking the new market conditions after entering January.</p>
<p>Frequent fluctuations in the morning. The price opened early and fell by four taels to 654.5 taels. Large deals from the previous Saturday did not decrease as expected but rose by sixteen and three-eighths. The silver price fell by one-eighth, but it was not affected. Then, the price fell from six and a half taels to four taels. Soon, Zhifeng Yong, Qian Changxiang, Yongfeng Hengxing, Hengchang Yongxie, and others scrambled to buy, and the price soared by ten taels in an instant to 63.8 taels. Afterwards, Shunli, Cuichang Yongyuan, Mao Yong, and others sold, and the price immediately fell by five taels. The announced price of the pound sterling remained unchanged at 59 taels. Internally, the US dollar bank traded at 33.3125 yuan, and the near-term was 33.0625 yuan. Daxing Yonghengxingyuan and foreign firms such as Qiao Rifu rushed to cover their shorts, so the price jumped up another eight or nine taels, reaching 68 taels at 9:30, as the US dollar was only calculated at 33 yuan. Then, it traded at 32.9375 yuan. Afterwards, selling became active, with Bingxing Yifeng Yuanxing Yongda Lianbang and others selling together. In particular, rumors spread that Japan would ban gold exports (but this was not confirmed), and people's hearts were easily shaken, leading to a drastic fall. At 10:20, the price was 60 taels, then it added another four taels. At 10:30, it was 64 taels. Unexpectedly, Chenfeng Yongheng Yu and others came to sell, and the price immediately turned downward. At 11:15, it was 56.5 taels. Then, the exchange rate also declined, and Indian exchange reported a small two annas. At 11:30, it was 62 taels. However, sellers did not relent, and the price continued to decline, closing in the morning at 55.2 taels, then trading again at 56 taels. The announced price was still 744 taels, with an estimated press of around 80 taels. At noon, it was around 90 taels.</p>
<p>The afternoon buying was very active. The post-market opened at 56.5 taels, then at 5.8 taels. Later, Yuan Mao Yongheng Yucheng Fengyong Zhifeng Yong and others rushed to buy, and foreign firms also covered their pound sterling, so the price traded at 19.3125, and then only settled at 25. Therefore, the gold price rose by more than seven taels, reaching 63 taels around 3:00. At this time, 物 品 and others sold, slightly less than two taels, at 60.02. The situation changed rapidly, with a tendency to soar. Because Bombay was down by six annas, the market was filled with strong buying from Chen Tianxiang, Yuan Mao Yongcheng Fengyong Fu Yu Fuchang, Hengchang Yong, and general short sellers. At 3:30, it had broken through 70 taels, probably because Bombay telegraphed the pound sterling at 19.1875. In an instant, the bank offered a price of 9 pence 0625, then later 8 pence 875, with the US dollar at 32.5625 to half a yuan. The market was extremely brisk, and sentiment was quite high. At 4:20, it actually reached 79.5 taels. Large deals were looking bearish. By the time the market closed at 4:20, it had fallen back to 77.5 taels, because many retail investors with long positions had profits to be made and immediately sold, so it was suppressed. After the market closed, it re-traded at 8 taels to 6 taels. Compared to the previous Saturday (based on the listed price), it rose by nineteen taels. The maximum for the whole day was 79.5 taels, and the minimum was 54 taels, a difference of 25.5 taels, which can be considered huge. Item's early market was 55.5 taels, the morning close was 55 taels, the afternoon was 56 taels, and the closing was 78.5 taels. The announced price was estimated to be around 80 taels to 645 taels, resulting in 70 taels. The registered price was 58 taels to 55 taels in the morning and 81 taels to 78 taels in the afternoon. The water supplement was 58 taels in the morning and 81 taels in the afternoon. The red strip was estimated to be 5.25 taels.</p>
<p>Transactions were disorganized and numerous. On the floor, Zhifeng Yong, Qian Changxiang, Tong Taichang, Hengxing Yuan, Yongfeng Yu Da, Daxing Yong, Yuan Da Yong, Yifeng Yong, Futai Heng, and Qiao Jingfu Wu and others bought, and Shunli, Wanxing Yifeng, Yuan Mao Yong, Da Decheng, Changsheng Yong, Tianxiang, Yuanxing Yong all sold. Yuantai and Hengxing Bingxing Xiangchang had many ups and downs. In the afternoon, Heng Yu, Yuan Mao Yong, Tong Taichang, Da Decheng, Fuchang Fu Yu, Cheng Fengyong Yuanfeng Yong, Zhifeng Yong, Tianxiang, Futai Heng, and Wu all bought, and Shunli Wan Guang, Qian Changxiang Daxing Yong, Bingxing, and Hengxing all sold. Yu Da, Yuan Heng, Yifeng Yong, Yuantai, Yuan Kangxiang, Items, and others had frequent ups and downs. The Guangdong Bank had 3-400 ups and downs and the Dalian Bank sold more than 2,000 items, probably for hedging, and then entered 3-400 items. Because Dalian was on holiday, there were no large transactions.</p>

<p>Gold Industry Speculates···Market Sentiment Especially Strong</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, the Bank of England lengthened while the US bank shrunk, exchange rates still fell, and the market was calm. Yesterday, HSBC's listed prices for British and American currencies remained unchanged, only Hong Kong dollars increased by 0.0625, calculated at 76.6875 taels. The French franc decreased slightly by three yuan, and the German exchange remained unchanged at a little over half a yuan. It is likely that the internal markets are all trending towards tightness, initially calm but then firm. Around noon, it seemed loose, but suddenly strengthened in the afternoon. Consequently, the gold price is about to rise to the 80 tael mark, but it is quite volatile. Compared to last Saturday, British gold shrank by half a penny, and US gold shrank by 0.75. It is likely that British gold is being bought by Jewish merchants J. Joseph &amp; Sons and others. Moreover, there is also speculation in the gold industry. In the afternoon, a telegraph from Bombay purchased about ten million pounds, so the market sentiment is especially strong. Approximately 200,000 pounds were transacted in total, and about one million yuan of US dollars were also transacted. Various gold firms alternately sold and bought, occasionally covering short positions. The hedging spread was around 55 taels. However, banks are unwilling to sell easily, which is why sentiment is high.</p>
<p>British Exchange: The internal market fluctuated by half a penny. The loosest was 1 shilling 9 and 375/1000 pence, the tightest was 8 and 75/100 pence. The asking price in the early market was about 9 and 25/100 pence, and the buying price was 3125/10000. Holland and Sumitomo traded with each other at 3.3125 for March. Mackrow offered 25/100, Mitsubishi and HSBC traded 25/100 for March. Also, Shanghai Mitsui sold 25/100 to HSBC. Holland and Chase traded 3125/10000 with each other, and Mitsui and Holland traded 25/100 with each other. The closing bid price at noon was 3125/10000, and the buying price was 375/1000. In the afternoon, Mackrow offered 3125/10000 for November (Joseph &amp; Sons buying). Yokohama Specie Bank, Sumitomo, Mitsui, British Bank, etc., offered 1875/10000 for December (Bombay buying). The closing bid price was 18.875, and the buying price was 9375/10000.</p>
<p>US Exchange: The internal market fluctuated by 0.875. The loosest was 33.375 yuan, and the tightest was 32.5 yuan. The asking price in the morning was about 33.1875 yuan, and the buying price was 3125/10000. HSBC initially absorbed 375/10000 for February and traded with Mitsui at 3125/10000. It also absorbed 375/10000 for March and sold 3125/10000 to Mitsui for March. Yokohama Specie Bank sold 0.06125 to Banque Belge pour l'Etranger and Mitsui for January. Chung Foo bought 1875/10000 for March and also bought from Mackrow for 33 yuan. Mackrow offered, and Mitsui bought, 32.9375 yuan. HSBC bought 0.0625 and traded with Mitsui for 33 yuan. The closing bid price at noon was 33.125 yuan, and the buying price was 0.25. In the afternoon, Holland traded 0.125 with Societe Franco-Chinoise de Banque et de Commerce. Yokohama Specie Bank and Banque Belge pour l'Etranger traded 0.125 with each other for December. American Express and Holland traded 0.125 with each other. HSBC offered 32.5 yuan for January and traded 0.5625 with Mitsui. The closing bid price was roughly 12.5 yuan, and the buying price was 32.625 yuan. One US dollar is still worth 3 taels, 1 mace, and 0.0077 candareens.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Call Loan Market Firm and Tighter Than Usual <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Market Overview: Currently, the financial community, in view of the significant impact of the external situation and the erosion caused by the internal stock market crash, is in a state of extreme panic. The grounding of the Cheng Yi Bank the other day is particularly worrying for the economic future.</p>
<p>Call Loan Prices: (Foreign Call Loans) Recently, due to tight money, there seems to be little interest in trading foreign loans. Therefore, there is little competition in the market price of foreign call loans. Yesterday, the prices in the morning and afternoon markets were both 7 mace, 2 candareens, 4 li, 6 hao, and 2 hu and a half, which was half a li better than the day before. The situation was mostly peaceful. (Silver Call Loans) The morning market was still 5 mace and a half. The afternoon market was slightly lower by 5 fen, calculated at 5 mace. The bank listed price was 2 candareens and 2 fen, with an added margin of 3 candareens and 3.4 fen, reaching over 4 candareens at the highest.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Currency Market Conditions: Jiangnan small coins were 6 mace, 4 candareens, and 9 li in both the morning and afternoon markets, still the same as the day before. Transactions were 5,000 jiao in the morning market and 3,500 jiao in the afternoon market. Guangdong small coins were 6 mace, 4 candareens, and 9 li and a half in the morning market, down another li from the afternoon market the day before. Transactions were made at the same price in the afternoon market. Transactions totaled 180,000 jiao in the morning market and 45,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins remained unchanged at 379,500 cash, with transactions of over 30,300 strings.</p>

Receipts from Qianzhuang and silver companies totaled over 45.5 million, receipts for margin loans were over 4.22 million, receipts for various remittance loans were over 900,000, and cash receipts were over 1 million. (Foreign Currency) Foreign currency remittance drafts totaled 1.435 million in the morning market and 1.025 million in the afternoon market.

<h3 id="e103">Securities: The Bond Market Presents a Mixed State <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Price Increases and Decreases Offset, Fluctuations Still Significant</p>
<p>Trading in November Futures Will Be Suspended Starting Tomorrow</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market conditions for various bonds on the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange showed that although many spot bonds were offered, transactions remained scarce. The futures market experienced significant price fluctuations, and trading was more active than before. With the delivery period approaching, there were also many transactions involving hedging or switching positions. As of yesterday, the trend of various bonds was influenced by the situation, with no new developments. Market sentiment was more chaotic than before. However, with the expiration of this month's futures imminent, the varying supply and demand conditions led to price increases and decreases without a consistent trend. Nevertheless, the fluctuations were quite significant. Some futures contracts for this month differed significantly from those for next month, such as consolidated tax, salt tax, and troop reduction bonds, with differences reaching two or three yuan. This was because ordinary retail investors, unable to take delivery, were actively seeking to sell their contracts for this month. However, the tension was not as high as it was at the end of last week, and the situation had generally stabilized slightly. As a result, compared to the previous week, the increases and decreases were very chaotic, ranging from four or five jiao to about three yuan. Observing the situation in the bond market, it seems unlikely that there will be a turnaround, and general market sentiment remains as weak as before. It is estimated that futures transactions reached over 10 million in the morning and over 5.5 million in the afternoon, totaling over 15.54 million yuan. Of this, consolidated tax bonds accounted for about 2.4 million, 20-year bonds for over 2 million, and 20-year customs salt tax bonds for 1.89 million. Spot transactions totaled 19,000 yuan. Also, today is the last day of trading for November futures, and trading will be suspended starting tomorrow in order to prepare for delivery.</p>

<p>Yarn Market Struggles to Escape the Pressure of the Situation</p>
<p>Yarn prices fell in the morning and rose in the afternoon, but the trend remained weak. Due to the difficulties facing the nation, especially the aggression of Japan, coupled with the financial emergency and depressed sentiment, retail investors tended to sell, causing the market to weaken significantly. This month, prices broke through the 9 tael mark. However, a major player continued to buy on dips. Nevertheless, the serious situation and the lack of yarn sales posed significant obstacles.</p>
<p>Man-Made Fiber Starts Low and Recovers: In the morning market, man-made fiber opened with weak American cotton and unfavorable news, leading to scattered sentiment. Prices for various months fell by 5, 7, 8 candareens to 1 tael and 2 candareens. In the afternoon, news of good actual sales led to a slight increase in buyers, and prices for various months rose by 2, 5, 7, 8 candareens. Total transactions for the day were estimated at 36,000 bales. Dafu bought 1,700 bales, Jifeng 950 bales, Changji 1,100 bales, Changfeng 1,550 bales, Shengtai 1,300 bales, and Houfeng 950 bales. Senkang bought 1,050 bales, Xincheng 1,400 bales, Rongxing 1,000 bales, Taixing 1,250 bales, and Hengde 750 bales. The closing prices are recorded below, along with increases, decreases, and outstanding balances:</p>
<p>| Month | Closing Price | Change | Outstanding Balance |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| November | 14.90 taels | Down 1.20 taels | 22,100 bales |</p>
<p>| December | 15.02 taels | Up 0.07 taels | 58,350 bales |</p>
<p>| January | 15.14 taels | Up 0.01 taels | 72,500 bales |</p>
<p>| March | 15.26 taels | No Change | 62,950 bales |</p>
<p>| January | 15.21 taels | Down 0.02 taels | 74,500 bales |</p>
<p>| April | 15.28 taels | Up 0.03 taels | 39,850 bales |</p>
<p>Spot Demand Still Not Bad: Spot yarn sales were still good. It is estimated that various trading houses bought a total of 1,200 bales throughout the day, and trading companies bought 150 bales. Market conditions were average. Among the customer groups, mainland customers bought 100 bales, northern customers 30 bales, Guangdong customers 860 bales, Shantou customers 60 bales, and miscellaneous customers 55 bales.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Cotton Market Flat and Soft <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market was flat and weak. Overseas conditions were very poor, and there was a risk of breaking through the 6-cent mark again. However, the gold price was still firm, which helped to mitigate some of the downward trend. There was little interest in spot cotton from various factories. Hankou and mainland sources were very scarce, so the bulls' pull remained strong and they were unwilling to loosen their grip. This month's price could still maintain 2 taels and 23 candareens.</p>
<p>Hankou Cotton Subject to US Cotton Pressure: In the morning market, Hankou cotton opened with declining US cotton, and sentiment softened. Prices for various contracts fell by 0.05 to 0.15 yuan. In the afternoon, the market remained weak, falling another 0.05 to 0.1 yuan. Total transactions for the day were estimated at 68,200 dan. Changji sold 1,000 dan, Yuda 2,800 dan, Gongtai 2,100 dan, Ruida 3,800 dan, and Changhe 4,400 dan. Hengda bought 1,300 dan, Jifeng 1,800 dan, Rongxing 1,400 dan, Xincheng 4,300 dan, Taixing 1,800 dan, and Yuantai 1,000 dan. The closing prices are recorded below, along with increases, decreases, and outstanding balances:</p>

<p>Bombay: Market conditions were firmer than overseas last week, mostly due to speculative buying. However, this high price is unlikely to be sustained due to a lack of support from exporters. There were no transactions with Japan except for urgent needs, and new cotton orders were also fewer than in previous years. Finally, the trend strengthened again due to the smooth progress of the London Round Table Conference. Spot activity was minimal, and local factories actively purchased. The following is a summary of statistics for the past week (in thousands of bales):</p>
<p>|  | 1930 | 1931 |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| Cumulative receipts from September 1 | 230 | 151 |</p>
<p>| Weekend inventory | 357 | 282 |</p>
<p>| Cumulative exports from September 1 | 460 | 237 |</p>
<p>| Exports to Europe | 109 | 50 |</p>
<p>| Exports to China | 92 | 81 |</p>
<p>| Other regions | 4 | 16 |</p>
<p>Liverpool: Spot sales remained strong last week, while the futures market was quiet. The sharp fall in silver prices and the small declines in most commodity prices made people uneasy. At the weekend, there was a slight turnaround, and the small price declines attracted more buyers. The Egyptian cotton market fluctuated.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Grains: The River Down Rice Market Continues to Soften <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Nantou: Thirty boats arrived yesterday, and sales were very sluggish. Northern japonica rice heard fell 2 jiao. Tongli Pingli new japonica rice also tended to go downstream, and the situation was even worse. Sales in urban and rural shops were increasingly weak throughout the day. Prices fell again by 1-2 jiao. Qingjiao and Sisong thin rice fell and the downward trend became more pronounced, falling 3-4 jiao. Actual green rice sales were weak, and letters from producing areas reported weakness. Not many foreign Du Jian rice arrived, and the situation continued to weaken.</p>
<p>Xinzha: Many boats arrived yesterday, and transactions were quiet. Sales of Western new rice were mixed, with good demand for top-quality rice but weakness for ordinary rice, down 3 jiao. There were few inquiries about early and late rice, and prices fell by 2-3 jiao. Glutinous rice was still in high demand from liquor producers, so the selling price was stable. Foreign Du Jian rice was also dull and lifeless. Sales of old and broken rice improved, and the market was firm. Yesterday, two train carloads of Nanjing sharp rice from Shanghai and Nanjing arrived and were purchased by the Zhenxing and Xiechang rice mills. Prices have not yet been set.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Imported Rice Shows No Improvement for Now <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's imported rice market still showed no improvement. Spot sales were only slightly better in the local street. In the futures market, foreign firms still intended to continue selling, so there was no hope of development in the market for the time being. Moreover, with the recent extreme tightness of money in the market, even more importers are watching and waiting. It is rumored that a certain foreign firm received a telegram from the producing area stating that small size rice was only being offered at 4 taels and 7 qian. The market's bid was 4 taels and 6 qian and a half, and a telegram has been sent to inquire. If this becomes a reality, it will be even more difficult for the market to recover.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Tight Money Drives Flour Market <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Next Month's Contracts Plunge by a Significant 4.75 Fen</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market opened in the morning. The markets for various months, due to foreign wheat quotations improving by 2-3-4 jiao, had somewhat stable sentiment. However, due to the urgency of the financial situation, buyers were inevitably greatly affected, so a soft sign had already appeared in the stability. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, the near and distant sentiment suddenly saw a great shock. Because large and small factories, due to the turmoil in the north, saw a decrease in actual sales, thus each factory's accumulated flour daily saw increases. A portion of monetary relations, near-term goods continued to be released, causing great market weakness, a united and volatile fall (Tianjin banks did have a purchasing, otherwise the decline would have been uncontrollable). Looking at this kind of scene, it was completely driven by monetary restrictions. If actual sales improve, it should stabilize. As a result, this month's decline was 3.75 fen lower than the previous weekend, October's decline was 4.75 fen, January's decline was 3.75 fen, February's decline was 3 fen, March's decline was 2.25 fen, and April's decline was 2 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Wheat Market Plummets <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Many Take Profits···This Month's Contracts Fall by 9 Fen</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market presented a picture of initial calm followed by declines. With foreign wheat quotations slightly improving by 2-3-4 jiao, sentiment was fairly stable. In the afternoon, the panic in the flour market also led to fatigue in some sentiment. Moreover, with this month's contracts about to expire, most bulls had to unwind their positions. In view of the lack of a revival in flour sales, the wheat market's outcome had no hope. Therefore, many sold, and market atmosphere then plummeted. In the flat market, one could still hedge by buying, but now, with monetary tightening and little support, the outcome is still difficult to view favorably. Distant months had a less significant decline because bulls were still willing to defend, As a result, this month's contracts fell by a significant 9 fen compared to the previous weekend, December's contracts fell by 4 fen, and January, February, March, and April contracts each fell by 3 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Sugar Market: Coarse and White Sugar Prices Roughly Stabilized <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market received telegrams from producing regions. The price of Cuban raw sugar was still 1.34375. New York sugar futures for December and March of next year were both 1.19, down 2 points from the previous telegrams. May was 1.124, and September was 1.33, with no changes compared to previous prices. Java raw and futures sugar also saw no increase or decrease. The guild market allocation plate, the transactions were still sparse. The transaction price for Dutch No. 24 coarse white sand was still 10 taels, finely ground white sand was 10 taels and 5 fen, and cotton Dutch white was 11 taels and 2 qian and a half, with a stable trend. Tai Gu sugar saw slack inflows and outflows, and "B" mark slightly decreased, with the price at 11 taels and a half. HX mark was 11 taels and 3 qian and a half, DY mark was 11 taels and 4 qian and a half, and HM mark was 11 taels and 5 fen. The market situation was still firm. Sales volume on the market allocation plate was still quiet. Yuan Lai Company sold tens of bags of self-made number one sliced ice sugar at a price of 16 taels and 8 qian, and the market seemed still smart.</p>

<p>Yesterday's silk market in foreign firms in this port continued to be quiet. Green exchange rate has become tight daily. European telegrams showed no turnaround. Although stockholders have intent to buy, they are forcefully suppressing prices. Chinese merchants have difficulty selling, and yesterday only Da Chang and others bought 20 packages of white raw silk, and Ke Chang bought 6 packages of yellow silk, with flat air prices.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Milan Dried Cocoon Increasingly Sluggish <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Factory Sales Stagnant, Inventory Increasingly Thick···Cocoon Prices Decrease, Market Lacks Buyers Milan market, since the new cocoons came onto the market, the European sales of Chinese silk have long shown no improvement. Silk factories have relied on shutdowns and temporary work stoppages to reduce silk production, resulting in the dried cocoon market increasingly becoming sluggish. In the last half-month, factory sales have completely stopped, and inventory has increasingly thickened. Although cocoon merchants are reducing prices to seek sales, no one asks about it. The spring cocoon price is only opening at 86 lire, the summer cocoon at 72 lire, and the autumn cocoon at 78 lire, but there are no buyers in all cases.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Premium Green Tea European Sales Continue Smoothly <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's tea market in foreign firms in this port saw premium green tea from both Lu and Tu trading houses sold at English firms Xie He, Tong Fu, and Bao Chang, among others, showing increased intent to buy. Needle-shaped and pearl tea varieties also had scattered transactions, and the market situation was quite active. The total market estimated that over a thousand boxes were sold. Selling prices were generally trending stable. However, Wuyuan premium tea had no inquiries from English and French houses, and the market was unevenly brisk and sluggish.</p>

<p>Domestically produced military yellow serge has been selling very well recently. Imported goods have been sold out one after another, and the latter batches had no imports. At the moment, the military and academic circles are adding to their uniforms, and all are specifying domestically produced goods. However, most of the output is from the Zhanghua factory. For orders over 100 yards, a 30% deposit is required. Most orders are made-to-order and currently produced. The factory is not willing to conduct transactions with anything other than cash accounts from foreign firms. Each yard sells for 2 taels and 4 qian. Retail sales at the door are 3 yuan and 6 jiao per yard. However, Dahua's quality is slightly looser, and the selling price is 2 taels and 3 qian, and retail cuts are 3 yuan and 4 jiao.</p>

<p>The market for imported woolen fabrics and plush remains stable. Because the weather has not yet turned cold, the movement of overcoat fabrics is sluggish, but those who hold the goods are generally optimistic. If the weather turns cold one day, sales will definitely be smooth. The stocks of various overcoat fabrics at sea are not heavy. Statistics show that each warehouse has less than 200 boxes. When the weather turns cold, local customers will compete to buy, and the market should have the potential to rise. Therefore, at the moment, those with slightly more financial resources are unwilling to sell cheaply. Yesterday, Dehua Li, Lao Gong Mao, Wu Feng, and other top-tier plaid overcoat fabrics all sold for 7 taels and 6 qian and a half, an increase of over 1 qian compared to the previous week. Mid-tier overcoat fabrics alone saw a decline, likely due to differing inventory levels and the sluggishness of demand.</p>

<p>After the Japanese aggression and occupation of the eastern provinces, the North Ning Railway was interrupted, transportation was blocked, and the local source of Beipiao coal fines was cut off. The selling price rose accordingly, with each ton recently requiring 10 taels and 2 qian and a half. A ship carrying a load of Beipiao lump coal suddenly arrived at the Japan-China Port Beipiao Terminal the other day, totaling over 2,000 tons. It is said that this coal was remaining inventory from the Yingkou stack yard, and not directly loaded from the mine. However, lump coal sales are not good here, so the selling price also failed to be favorable. It is rumored that it is currently selling for about 14 taels per ton.</p>

<h3 id="e119">Bankers Association Discussed Public Debt Issue Yesterday <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Ministry of Finance and Banking Sector Successfully Negotiate Financial Public Debt</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance previously had a plan to issue 80 million in public debt to consolidate the financial administration for the 20th year, as the financial administration for the 20th year urgently needed consolidation. This proposal had been approved by the Legislative Yuan. The Ministry of Finance had also repeatedly negotiated with the banking sector in this port, requesting allocation or collateral. Subsequently, with the Nanking-Guangdong parties holding peace talks, the peace conference itself had an organization for a unified finance committee, and it was stipulated that the central military and administrative expenses should not exceed 12 million for the entire year. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance's original plan to issue 80 million fundamentally conflicted with this, and it was decided to change the issuance to 12 million, in line with the principles of the unified finance committee's plan. This matter was brought up at the finance committee meeting previously held in Peking and was well understood by all parties. The Ministry of Finance then directly contacted various banks in this city again to negotiate, intending to first provide collateral as before. At the same time, the Guangdong delegation's representatives in Shanghai wrote to the Bankers Association, instructing not to allocate sales, as this would violate the principles of the establishment of the Finance Committee. After receiving the letter, the Bankers Association believed that this matter was of great importance, so it convened a meeting yesterday to discuss it. Over a dozen bank representatives attended, including Zhang Gongquan, Li Fusun, Hu Mengjia, Xu Jiyun, and Wang Boyuan, Lin Kanghou, etc. After a long discussion, it was unanimously agreed that the central government's public debt had not been contacted with the Bankers Association at all. Since the Ministry of Finance had directly negotiated with various banks, the Bankers Association seemed difficult to intervene. Fellow members of the banking sector eagerly awaited the early realization of peace in the country. Therefore, there had been a proposal for a unified finance committee and a decision never again to assist any party by issuing public debt that would fuel civil war. Fellow members of the banking sector decided to adhere to this decision unwaveringly. Therefore, it was decided to reply to the Guangdong representatives based on this view and hope that peaceful unification between Nanking and Guangdong could be achieved as soon as possible so that they could unite against foreign enemies. As for the Ministry of Finance's issuance of this public debt, according to the Huadong News Agency reporter's inquiries in various directions, the total amount of the issuance has indeed been decided at 12 million. The Ministry of Finance has repeatedly worked to smooth things over with the banking sector. However, the designated quota has not yet been decided. Yesterday, Minister of Finance Song Ziwen specifically came to Shanghai from Peking for this matter. It is heard that various banks in this port, considering that the central government's finances are indeed tight, and at a time when the Japanese invaders are increasingly pressing closer, the country's finances must be maintained, have expressed their agreement. In about a day or two, the Ministry of Finance and the various banks should be able to negotiate everything.</p>

At about 5:00 PM, accompanied by Jianghai Customs Supervisor Tang Haian, he went to the French Concession's Rue Bourgeat to visit Guangdong representative Wang Jingwei. Mr. Wang and Mr. Song met alone upstairs for about an hour, only leaving at exactly 6:00 PM. Wang sent him to the door. After Song left, Wang told the Xinsheng News Agency reporter that Song had come under orders to report on the detailed process of the 4th Plenary Session held by the Kuomintang and explain the Finance Committee matter. Song stated that the current members of the Finance Committee in Nanking would retain only a small number of personnel in the future and that the organization of the committee would still be based on the resolutions of the Nanking-Guangdong Peace Preparatory Meeting.</p>

He went separately to see Wang Jingwei, Hu Hanmin, Zou Lu, and Wu Chaoshu. It is reported that Chen's arrival in Shanghai yesterday was either to urge these gentlemen, Wang, Wu, Hu, and Zou, at the behest of Chairman Chiang, to go to Beijing together to preside over matters, or to inspect the Songhu defense works after the arrival of the 19th Route Army in Shanghai.</p>

<p>Organization of Finance Committee Can Be Amended at Any Time</p>
<p>No Diplomatic Issues After Chiang's Trip to the North</p>
<p>The Situations in the Three Northeastern Provinces and Mongolia Are Different</p>
<p>Yesterday, at 2:00 PM, in response to requests from various foreign correspondents, Wang Jingwei, representing Guangdong, met with reporters from Reuters, the Associated Press, the German Daily, the Shanghai French Paper, the New York Daily, the North-China Daily News, The Times, The London Times, and others at his residence. First, the reporters raised three key points, and Wang answered them one by one. The Q&amp;A is recorded below: (Reporter) Does the newly organized Finance Committee in Nanjing conflict with the principles decided upon during the peace conference? The number of members seems to be greater than what was agreed upon at the conference, and there are quite a few military personnel among the members. What are your thoughts on this? (Wang) The Finance Committee organized in Nanjing does indeed differ from the principles agreed upon at the peace conference. As for the number of people, the number decided upon at the peace conference was originally an assumption. The number needed should be determined by the actual requirements, so there is no fixed standard. According to the current number of members, the government seems to have too much control. However, these issues can be remedied after the unified government is established. If there are any improprieties, they can be amended at any time. (Q) Is Chiang Kai-shek going to Beiping on his trip to the north, and is his mission solely focused on Japan, or are there other issues? Who will be responsible for diplomatic matters after Chiang's trip to the north? (A) Mr. Chiang is going to Beiping on this trip north, not to Luoyang. His mission, in addition to recovering lost territories, also involves reorganizing the military and political defenses in North China. As for the issue of Mr. Chiang leaving Nanjing, it will absolutely not be as you all speculate. Since the Nanjing-Guangdong peace conference, both sides have been in complete agreement on foreign policy, which is the responsibility of the Nanjing government. Therefore, Mr. Chiang's trip to the north will not cause any diplomatic problems at all. Moreover, at this critical time for China, the entire nation is preoccupied with saving the country and has no intention of doing anything else. (Q) The Russian invasion of Outer Mongolia and the Japanese occupation of Manchuria today are both matters of interest. Why is the domestic opposition to Japan so fierce today? (A) The Russian invasion of Outer Mongolia and the current Japanese occupation of the Eastern Provinces are completely different. There are three points to explain this difference: (1) The Outer Mongolia incident occurred when Duan Qirui was in power, and Duan's government was soon overthrown. (2) Outer Mongolia only has Mongolians, but Manchuria has Han, Hui, and other ethnic groups, so the situation is completely different. Moreover, the Outer Mongolia issue was declared in the manifesto of the First National Congress of the Kuomintang in the 13th year of the Republic, stating that China will, in any case, unite the five races in the future. (3) The Russian invasion of Outer Mongolia had limitations and was not like the Japanese invasion and occupation of Manchuria this time, which involved attacking and killing innocent people and even using Puyi to force the extraction of salt revenues, a blatant act of aggression. At this point, the conversation ended.</p>

Recently, the defense of the Zhabei area has been undertaken by the 2nd Regiment of the Tax Police Group. The area from Jiangwan to Wusong is defended by the 1st Regiment of the Tax Police Group. In the South City, the 3rd Regiment of the Tax Police is stationed. In the Longhua area, in addition to the Tax Police, there are two battalions of soldiers from the 5th Division. In total, there are about 10,000 people in the entire city, which is an increase in strength compared to before.</p>

<p>Yan Huaiqing, the ambassador to the United States, is scheduled to leave for his post within a few days. The ambassador to France, Qian Yongming, has too many business and social affairs in the country and cannot easily extricate himself. He has repeatedly and firmly declined the position and has been understood by the government. It is rumored that the authorities have indeed found a successor, and an announcement will be made once approved.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Zhang Fakui Talks About His Route of Departure <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>From Guangxi to Hunan and Hubei to Beiping</p>
<p>Willing to Accompany Chairman Chiang</p>
<p>Since Zhang Fakui expressed his willingness to depart to aid Heilongjiang, all sectors have expressed deep sympathy. Yesterday, Lu Fengshi, editor of the *Tongwen Monthly* jointly published by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Chinese Vocational Society, visited Zhang to inquire about his route of departure. The main points of his conversation are recorded below: (Q) By which route will the general depart this time to aid Heilongjiang? (A) Departing from Guangxi, via Hunan and Hubei to Beiping. (Q) Can you tell us the specific methods of assisting Ma Zhanshan? (A) Military matters are constantly changing and difficult to predict with certainty. If the troops can reach Beiping in the near future, they will meet with representatives of Ma Zhanshan near Shanhaiguan to formulate a plan and launch attacks on different routes. In short, I am determined to do my best until I die. (Q) Can the government actually provide assistance? (A) Patriotic actions should be met with a satisfactory response from both governments. However, no reply has been received yet. If it is not adopted, I will consider the situation and depart automatically. (Q) It is heard that Chairman Chiang is going north. Will the general accompany him? (A) I hope that Chairman Chiang can go north, and I would be even more welcome to accompany him. (Q) Have there been prior contacts with the Northeast authorities? Will this not cause other misunderstandings? (A) There has never been any contact. Under patriotic actions, there is no such thing as misunderstanding. (Q) If there is no substantial assistance from the government, where will the military supplies come from? (A) I will not retreat due to any twists and turns and am willing to starve to death in Hunan. The above are the main points of the conversation. The details will be published in the 11th issue of the *Monthly*. The *Monthly* has always been enthusiastic about patriotic movements and has recently offered a large sum of money for articles collecting concrete materials for national salvation.</p>

<p>The Group of Students Studying Military Science in Japan Who Have Abandoned Their Studies to Save the Country sent a telegram to General Ma Zhanshan, Chairman of the Heilongjiang Provincial Government: The violent Japanese have invaded. We students, filled with patriotic fervor, have abandoned our studies to return, but in this paralyzed environment where people do not know pain, we cannot even find a place to die. Now, you, sir, are fighting alone, preserving the integrity of soldiers and fighting for the survival of the nation. We are untalented but offer our flesh and blood to follow you. We have already had the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce remit 900 yuan to comfort you and your generals. We eagerly await your orders.</p>
<p>The Revolutionary Comrades Association of the Huangpu Military Academy sent a telegram: To General Ma Zhanshan, Chairman of Heilongjiang Province: The Japanese bandits are ferocious, invading our territory, slaughtering our compatriots, violating the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and willingly becoming the culprits who destroy world peace. Fortunately, you, sir, are fighting bravely under the policy of non-resistance, holding out alone for a long time. Your loyalty and righteousness have inspired the whole country. We hope that you, sir, will lead your brave soldiers to continue to hold firm. We, the members of the Association, are serving in the military and are dedicated to the party and the country. At this time of great crisis, protecting the country and saving the nation is our duty as soldiers to throw our heads and spill our blood. We are willing to lead all our revolutionary comrades as your rearguard. Looking north at the clouds over the frontier, our hearts and minds are with you. The Reorganization Committee of the Revolutionary Comrades Association of the Huangpu Military Academy, respectfully.</p>

<p>The Association of Unemployed Military Personnel sent a telegram: General Zhang Fakui of the Fourth Army, Your Excellency: The Japanese bandits have insulted our China, seized our territory, and after crossing Liaoning and Jilin, have captured Heilongjiang. Now they are relentlessly pursuing, determined to destroy our race. General Ma Zhanshan is fighting hard to resist, vowing to fight to the death. However, there are strong enemies in front and no reinforcements in the rear. The isolated army on the frontier is in imminent danger. Your Excellency has raised your voice, requesting to go to aid, washing away the shame of our soldiers and boosting the spirit of our nation. Your loyalty has been praised throughout the country. However, the Northeast has been lost for two months, and 30 million people are living in dire straits, unable to live or die, and eager for rescue, like those hanging upside down. It is hoped that you will quickly reorganize your troops and send them out immediately to avert disaster and secure the country. We, the members of this association, vow to restore our rivers and mountains with iron and blood. We are willing to follow after Your Excellency and General Ma Zhanshan, and to coexist with the soldiers on the front line. In our telegram, we express our indignation and hope for your consideration. Dong Lvzheng, Wu Hanqi, Li Wude, and others from the Association of Unemployed Military Personnel of the Republic of China, respectfully.</p>
<h3 id="e130">The National Products Promotion League Sends a Telegram Requesting Armed Recovery of Lost Territories <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>At the sixth regular meeting of the National Products Promotion League Committee, Wang Weijian proposed a temporary emergency motion stating that the violent Japanese were acting recklessly, occupying the Northeast, and disregarding the resolution of the League of Nations to withdraw troops by a deadline. He proposed that a telegram be sent to Commanders-in-Chief Chiang and Zhang, urging them to quickly dispatch troops to take back the lost territories by force, in order to safeguard national rights and quell public anger. The motion was approved. The secretariat drafted a telegram and sent it. The original telegram is recorded below: Urgent: To Commander-in-Chief Chiang in the capital and Deputy Commander-in-Chief Zhang in Beiping: The Japanese imperialists are destroying world peace, dispatching troops for no reason, forcibly occupying the Northeast, and completely exposing their ambition to invade Manchuria and Mongolia and annex China. Our country has always been magnanimous, adhering to the policy of non-resistance, seeking assistance from the League of Nations, and hoping for a peaceful resolution based on reason, in order to avoid rupturing the friendly relations between the two countries. However, the violent Japanese have taken advantage of our weakness, taking one step further after another, occupying Shenyang and Jilin, seizing Heilongjiang, and disturbing Tianjin and Beiping. Their ferocity and recklessness are progressing with the times, which is unbearable. The League of Nations is unable to impose sanctions. The only way is for our country to dispatch troops to save itself. It has been resolved by the third session, the sixth plenary committee meeting of the subordinate association, to telegraph the commanders-in-chief urging them to send troops quickly and take back the lost territories by force, which has been recorded. Therefore, we specially follow the resolution and request Your Excellencies to make a resolute decision, select elite troops, and dispatch troops immediately to recover the lost territories in the Northeast by force, in order to save the country from disaster and restrain the violent Japanese. We respectfully lead the national products industry to vow to be your rearguard and eagerly await your orders. The National Products Promotion League Committee, respectfully.</p>

<p>County Magistrate Yan of Shanghai County, believing that with the violent Japanese attacking Heilongjiang and General Ma's army isolated and without reinforcements, all of us should donate generously to express our patriotic enthusiasm, has already prepared a donation register and sent personnel to various districts to solicit donations. Yesterday, the Public Security Branch Offices, the Police Training Institute, and the Public Security Patrol Team under the jurisdiction of the county government were all visited by instructor Yan Maotang, who explained the great righteousness and strongly urged them to donate. The police officers, aware of the ambitions of the Japanese, were filled with righteous indignation and were willing to donate their personal salaries to aid Ma in his time of need. For a time, they were quite enthusiastic, and especially Wang Minqiao, Jiang Wenguang, and Yu Zukeng among the student police officers donated the most, which is commendable.</p>

<p>People in the Qian industry are no less patriotic than others. Seeing the urgency of the situation, the organization of a righteous and courageous national salvation effort cannot be delayed any longer. Yesterday, Zhu Songlin, Yu Futian, and five or six others initiated the establishment of the Qian Industry National Salvation Association to Resist Japan. Those comrades in the industry who wish to join are welcome. It is heard that there is an endless stream of people joining. The declaration is omitted for length.</p>

<p>Our city's Japan Problem Research Association, angered by the violent Japanese troops unreasonably dispatched to the Northeast, specifically held an anti-Japanese national salvation public opinion survey to see where the public sentiment lies and to prepare for Japan. Forms were made and distributed to all sectors to be freely filled out. It is heard that a total of 600,000 copies of the survey form were issued (there were also many copies made and distributed by various places, which were not included in the count). A total of 458,652 copies were filled out and submitted to the association. They have been busy with statistics for the past week and have finally completed the statistics. They have prepared a table and a document and submitted it to the authorities for reference in dealing with Japan. Recently, people from other provinces are still sending letters requesting copies in an endless stream. The association believes that the survey has ended, so they are politely refusing.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Refuting Japan's Five Basic Principles <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>The Sixth District Party Headquarters Sends a Telegram</p>
<p>The Sixth District Party Headquarters sent a telegram: (Omitted titles) The violent Japanese do not comply with international resolutions to withdraw troops by a deadline, but instead become more intense, disturbing our Tianjin-Qinhuangdao area and capturing our Heilongjiang province. They also released a declaration to whitewash their actions and insist on the so-called five basic principles, hoping to confuse international public opinion and obscure the principle of justice. Our people are filled with indignation. Therefore, we refute each of the principles: The three provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang are originally Chinese territory, but they have been invaded and occupied by Japanese troops for two months, galloping thousands of miles, killing our officials and civilians, and confiscating our property. Their aggression is not only a matter of policy and action but also an accomplished fact. Our troops have always asked for justice to be upheld and have not resisted. It is self-evident who is the aggressor. Therefore, the first principle, which states that both sides should eliminate policies and actions of aggression, is incomprehensible. The territory of China must be defended in its entirety by the Chinese people. There is no need for other countries to interfere. Since it is said to respect and integrity, troops should be withdrawn by the deadline. To not withdraw troops and talk of respect and list it as one of the basic principles, is it not a joke? Patriotism is the duty of a citizen. Democratic countries have no reason to interfere with patriotic movements. Moreover, the violent Japanese have provoked the anti-Japanese movement. The responsibility lies entirely with the violent Japanese. Our people have not harmed Japanese residents. What is there to prohibit? How can the violent Japanese use this as a pretext for coercion? Since the Northeast Incident, Chinese authorities have paid special attention to protecting Japanese residents in China, and no unfortunate incidents have occurred. According to international law, foreigners are protected as if they were citizens of the country. There is no reason to impose heavier obligations. The fourth principle of the declaration attempts to impose effective protection. What does effective mean? As for the fifth article on respecting Japan's treaty rights in the three northeastern provinces, treaties that have been legally enacted and signed by both parties of free will should, of course, be respected until they are formally repealed. However, treaties that have been declared repealed, treaties that have not been approved by the National Assembly, and secret treaties privately entered into by local officials have not been recognized by the Chinese people and cannot be considered existing treaties. The truth is clear. The violent Japanese continue to insist on the preposterous and their intention is to lay the foundation for occupying our Northeast and destroying our whole nation. Our compatriots should see through their wickedness, pledge to resist to the death, and never acknowledge these five principles, which are absurd and enough to destroy our country and our race. We send this urgent telegram in hope. The Executive Committee of the Shanghai Special Sixth District of the Kuomintang of China, respectfully.</p>

<h3 id="e136">No Panic Over Cotton Textile Raw Materials <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>The First Batch of British Yarn Will Arrive in Shanghai Soon</p>
<p>A Total of More Than 360 Pieces</p>
<p>Since the Social Affairs Bureau ordered the purchase of British yarn to replace Japanese yarn, the city's major mercerized cotton mills have been actively ordering large quantities of British yarn from the Manchester area to meet their needs. It is reported that the first batch of more than 360 pieces ordered has already been shipped from Manchester to Shanghai and will arrive soon. The second batch is also being ordered and shipped in succession. It is expected that there will be no panic over cotton textile raw materials in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Preparing to Establish a British Yarn Sales Organization <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Approved by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau / Instructed by the Ministry of Industry</p>
<p>Since the strict economic severance with Japan and the refusal of the city's mercerized cotton textile industry to import Japanese yarn, the various factories with weak capital have been unable to maintain operations due to the lack of raw materials. They have petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau to quickly set standards for laying off workers and to allow them to close some factories to avoid bankruptcy. The Social Affairs Bureau, believing that this matter has a great impact on the livelihoods of workers, rejected the petition and ordered the industry association to inform all its members that British yarn can be substituted if there is a shortage of raw materials. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau specially convened a meeting of relevant groups to discuss solutions, but no good results were achieved. The cotton mills said that the procedures for ordering British goods are complicated and that they would have to advance several thousand taels of capital, which is difficult for small factories to bear. After the groups gathered for a meeting, there were no effective remedies, so the industry association petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau to quickly establish a British yarn sales organization to facilitate the purchase of goods by the industry, or to allow them to set layoff standards to reduce disputes. It is now learned that the Shanghai Silk and Cotton Textile Industry Association received instruction No. 16922 from the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday: "Received and noted your presentation. It has been reported to the Ministry of Industry for consideration and the necessary approval after convening representatives from relevant agencies and groups to discuss remedial measures. We should wait to receive instructions before we go back and act upon their wishes. This order will be noted."</p>

<p>The Capital Amount is Temporarily Set at 100,000 National Currency</p>
<p>More Than 69,000 Yuan Has Been Collected</p>
<p>The issue of setting up a pulp yarn factory was proposed and after active solicitation of subscription to share by the local Shanghai Silk and Cotton Textile Association the proposal had been basically prepared. Yesterday afternoon, at 2:00 PM, a meeting was held at the Silk and Cotton Textile Association with a number of founders including Zhu Wenqi, Cui Fuzhuang, Cheng Jintang, Xu Yangnan, and others. In addition to resolving various important issues, seven preparatory committee members were elected to actively carry out everything. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e139">Key Issues Resolved <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>(1) The dyeing and weaving associations in Wuxi, Jiangyin, Wujin, and other places wanted to change the cotton yarn factory shares to operate a pulp yarn factory because it did not comply with the principles of the previous resolution, and had written to oppose it. The issue of how to handle was resolved by writing to various local associations to eliminate opinions, unite, and urge them to sign up to subscribe to shares so that the pulp yarn factory can be realized as soon as possible. (2) It was resolved that the pulp yarn factory to be established would be named Wanyuan Dyeing and Weaving Factory, and the capital was temporarily set at 100,000 yuan. (3) The scope of business was resolved, In addition to operating weaving, dyeing, and slurrying yarn, the preparatory committee may expand the scope of business in accordance with the capital, and the method shall be determined separately. (4) The preparatory office will be temporarily set up at the San Yangjing Bridge, Ruilinli, Shanghai Silk and Cotton Textile Association, and Cui Fuzhuang, Zhu Wenqi, Zhang Shusheng, Cheng Jintang, Pan Xuyi, Guan Pingzhi, and Xu Yangnan were elected as seven preparatory committee members.</p>

<p>The accounting office reported that the share funds have been received as follows: (1) Shanghai: 26,516.5 taels, (2) Hangzhou: 117.5 taels, (3) Suzhou: 1,300 taels, (4) Wuxi: 806 taels, (5) Jiangyin: 4,120 taels, (6) Changshu: 162.5 taels, (7) Changzhou: 8,024 taels (8) Other: 13,361 taels. The above totals to 50,699.5 taels, equivalent to more than 69,400 yuan, still short of 30,000 yuan from the 100,000 share quota, which will be the responsibility of the founders to solicit and pay off within the designated period to facilitate the start of the project.</p>

<p>Following the strike by all employees of the Datong Bookstore in this city, the company yesterday announced that it would dismiss all unreturned striking workers and hire new workers to continue working. Representatives from the Business and other four branch offices petitioned the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, and unions in the Zhabei District also issued a declaration of support. The details of each are recorded separately below:</p>
<h3 id="e146">Joint Petition <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Representatives from the Publishing Industry Workers' Union Business Branch, Chinese Branch, Minzhi Publishing Branch, and World Branch Offices, Qian Hongcai, Zhu Gongchui, Zhang Sigeng, Li Dixian, and others, went to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau at 10:00 AM yesterday to petition for: (1) The workers of the Datong Bookstore must be allowed to return to work with conditions; (2) It is hoped that efforts will be made to mediate quickly. They were received by Section Chief Zhang Zhenyuan of the bureau.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Company Announcement <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>The Datong Bookstore issued an announcement yesterday stating: "A portion of the bureau's workers went on an illegal strike on the 16th of this month. The Municipal Party Department and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau jointly issued a proclamation, strictly ordering them to resume work immediately, with a three-day deadline. Those who failed to return within the deadline would be considered voluntarily dismissed, and the bureau would be allowed to recruit new workers to supplement them. The bureau has already published an announcement in the newspaper notifying all striking workers to comply with the orders of the Party and government agencies and return to the bureau for work before November 21. Now that the deadline has passed, although a portion of the striking workers has returned to work, there are still many vacancies. At a time when foreign aggression is increasing daily and the Heilongjiang border has fallen, all of our citizens, as long as they have a breath left, should be inspired to stimulate their conscience and strive to revitalize industry to serve as a backing for the government's foreign policy. However, the striking workers of this bureau dare to disregard laws and regulations and destroy industry, which is truly heartbreaking. In order to comply with government laws and regulations, maintain industry, and unite against foreign aggression, the bureau has dismissed all striking workers who have not returned to work and has begun recruiting new workers in order to continue working. This announcement."</p>
<h3 id="e148">Union Attitude <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Wang Yongliang, a director of the Publishing Industry Workers' Union, told a reporter from the New Voice News Agency yesterday, "The Datong employees were oppressed and went on strike. In order to settle the matter and appease the people, the union adopted peaceful methods, such as: (1) Recognizing the right of the Publishing Industry Workers' Union to represent all members of the Datong Bookstore and subsidizing the Datong Branch Office's operating expenses with 60 yuan per month; (2) Continuing to negotiate the treatment conditions of Datong employees in good faith immediately; (3) Paying wages as usual during the strike period; (4) Not dismissing workers due to the workers' strike; (5) Permanently guaranteeing workers' jobs. However, because the company refused mediation, the matter has not been resolved. The employees are now insisting on opposition. If the company implements the announced dismissal and hires new workers, the employees will deal with it with a tough attitude and are willing to fight to the end."</p>
<h3 id="e149">Declaration of Support <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Zhabei District unions, such as the Sixth District Silk Reeling Industry Union, the Fourth District Silk Reeling Industry Union, the Shanghai Military Uniform Industry Workers' Union, the Shanghai Gas Industry Union, the Sixth District Tea Processing Industry Union, the Shanghai Binding Industry Union, the Sixth District Cotton Weaving Industry Union, the Sixth District Public Bus Industry Union, the Sixth District Wood and Water Industry Union, the Sixth District Enamel Industry Union, and the Municipal Leather Industry Union, issued a declaration yesterday in support of the strike by all employees of the Datong Bookstore. The text is omitted for length.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Two [Solemn Statements from Various Unions] <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>The Coincidence of the Telegram</p>
<p>On the 15th of this month, the publishing industry, medicine industry, five [illegible] industry, Fourth District Cigarette Industry, First District Water and Electricity Industry, Seventh District Cotton Weaving Industry, Fifth District Cotton Weaving Industry, Hotel Reception Industry, Binding Industry, Municipal Military Uniform Industry, Municipal Sauce Industry, Postal Service, Postal Workers' Union, and other 50 unions and one office held their fourth talk and decided on two important cases: (A) Various unions jointly telegraphed the National Government to reorganize the army to fight against Japan; (B) Various unions jointly telegraphed the Fourth Plenary Session to earnestly review the qualifications of Hou Dachun's representatives to the Fourth Plenary Session. The original telegrams (already seen in previous newspapers) were all formally and solemnly stamped by the various unions that attended the meeting and those that did not attend but were willing to be listed, and the procedures were extremely complete, and the files are available for review. This is a solemn statement. Also, the Shanghai Gas Industry Union, the Shanghai Binding Industry Union, the Shanghai Sixth District Public Bus Industry Union, the Shanghai Sixth District Silk Reeling Industry Union, the Shanghai Sixth District Enamel Industry Union, the Sixth District Tea Processing Workers' Union, the Municipal Leather Industry Union, the Sixth District Cotton Weaving Industry Union, and the Shanghai Military Uniform Industry Union, after reading the reports in various newspapers yesterday about the Shanghai unions' coincidental telegram to the Nanjing Fourth Plenary Session representatives, and carefully examining the content, which was purely the Hou Dachun incident, were extremely surprised. After the Hou case is currently under review by the Party Department and investigation by the court, it can be left to the decision. During this period, there seems to be no need to ask questions. As for the qualifications of the attending representatives, it is purely an internal Party matter, and our associations only know to seek the interests of the workers and should not intervene. The coincident telegram reported in the newspaper was brought by Ge Jun when he came to the meeting, carrying blank paper, explaining that the joint name would send a telegram to comfort Ma Zhanshan, who was loyally resisting Japan. Our associations did not doubt it at all and were willing to be listed and stamped. Unexpectedly, what was reported in yesterday's newspaper was actually a sleight of hand. In order to respect Party discipline and national law, our associations are specially making a solemn statement. In addition to paying attention to various documents to be listed in the future, we are making a special solemn statement as follows. I hope for your public recognition.</p>

<h3 id="e156">Communist General Defects and Entire Family Tragically Slaughtered <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>The Origin of the Corpses on Yaozhu Road</p>
<p>Gu Shunzhang Defects to the Central Government</p>
<p>Not Tolerated by the Communist Party</p>
<p>Aitang Village Suffers This Tragedy</p>
<p>A Total of Eleven People Killed</p>
<p>Corpses Also Hidden in Xiude Lane</p>
<p>Since the discovery of a large number of murdered men and women corpses in courtyards No. 33 and 37, Aitang Village, Yaozhu Road, French Concession, the day before yesterday, it has spread throughout Shanghai, all lamenting it as an unprecedented tragic case. However, at that time, there were many rumors, all of which were believed to be that the kidnappers had obtained meat tickets, and because they did not prepare the price for redemption, they suffered the disaster of tearing up the tickets, and the country concealed the corpses and destroyed the traces, and said that recently many kidnappers were arrested in Hankou, confessing the whole story of the case, and then a telegram was sent from Hankou to the French police to ask them to investigate on the spot. At that time, the reporter had very serious doubts about this kind of rumor, and all believed that since it was a tearing up of tickets, where did this large number of meat tickets come from, and how were the kidnappers arrested in Hankou? If it is said that the meat tickets were brought to Shanghai from Hankou, then thousands of miles apart, it takes four or five days by boat, and the military police are densely deployed along the way, even the most foolish bandits would never do this. Moreover, the purpose of the bandit's ticket is nothing more than money, even if it is absolutely impossible, accidental tearing up of tickets, the number will never be in batches, this is the most obvious fact. The reporter suspected at the time that this case might contain political effects and other special circumstances. Until yesterday, when the corpses were dug up and sent for burial, someone went to claim them. All the corpses were family bones and flesh. The cause of the case was that one of the family members of the deceased was an important member of the Communist Party. Later, he regretted it and surrendered to Chairman He Chengjiao of Hubei in Hankou. Finally, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek summoned him to Beijing and gave him an important position to jointly plan the strategy of clearing the Communists. Therefore, he suffered the wrath of the Communists, who came up with this poisonous plan to murder all his family members, even the servants and children, none were spared. It is also very tragic. Now, the details of the process are explored and recorded below:</p>
<p>Heaps of Corpses Rotten and Unbearable The case of the French police receiving a telegram from the Hankou authorities on the 21st, saying that many kidnappers were arrested in Hankou, confessing the truth of the ticket tearing, and burying nine corpses in houses No. 33 and 37, Aitang Village, Yaozhu Road, French Concession in this city, please investigate and so on. The detective chief immediately sent Chinese and Western detectives to investigate at the address. They dug up the mud in the patio inside the gate and found wooden boards. Looking at the corpses in the cracks, the corpses were piled up, but they were already rotten and unbearable. For the sake of caution, the police station waited for a report to the court before excavating, etc., which has been recorded in the newspaper. It is now known that this case is definitely not a ticket tearing by kidnappers, but a political nature. One of the cruel means of the Communist Party's killing each other. All the dead were family members of Gu Shunzhang of Wusong. Gu is 27 years old this year and is a promising young man. He used to work in Nanyang Tobacco Company and once went abroad to study in Germany. He was fascinated by the theory of Marxism. After returning to China, he joined the Communist Party and served as a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party and a member of the Central Political Committee. In the 16th year of the Republic of China, he served as the commander-in-chief of the National Industrial Circles Picket Team and a member of the Municipal Government. He was as famous as the important members of the Communist Party Xiang Zongfa, Li Lisan, and Zhou Enlai, and was known as the Four Great Generals.</p>
<p>Arrested in Hankou and Voluntarily Requested to Be Escorted to Beijing Among these four people, Gu's character was the most fierce. The Party once sent four of them to Shanghai to organize the Communist Party's Red Guards, specializing in all assassination duties. In April of this year, Gu was ordered by the Party to go to Hankou to command Party affairs. Gu left Shanghai with several companions and took a boat to Hankou. Unexpectedly, the opportunity was not secret. Gu and his party had not yet arrived in Hankou and had been detected by the Hankou Headquarters Camp. Personnel were sent to guard the pier. When Gu's boat docked, they were arrested. However, only three people were captured at the time, and one person escaped. Gu was taken into custody. When he was taken to the camp for questioning, Gu suddenly said nothing, only saying that he had to meet Chairman Chiang in Nanjing before he could make a confession. The camp did not ask any further questions and immediately escorted him to Nanjing to meet Commander-in-Chief Chiang.</p>
<p>Visits Chairman Chiang and Vows to Defect After Gu arrived in Beijing and met Chiang, he strongly stated his past mistakes, was willing to repent and reform, and presented the Communist Party's internal organization to Commander-in-Chief Chiang. Fortunately, Chiang was always magnanimous and saw that Gu's attitude was extremely sincere, so he did not blame the past and recruited him to his staff to jointly discuss the plan to suppress the Communists. It is said that Xiang Zhongfa was arrested and executed in Shanghai, which has something to do with Gu. At this time, Gu's family lived at No. 802 Weihaiwei Road in this city and voluntarily went to Hankou. Gu's family in Shanghai was taken care of and protected by his comrade Zhou Enlai. Gu was detained in Beijing, and his comrades in Hankou sent a telegram to Gu's family in Shanghai, saying that Gu had been detained and there would definitely be a risk of confiscation of his home. They were instructed to find a place to move. At that time, Gu's family immediately moved to No. 33 and 37, Aitang Village, Yaozhu Road, French Concession.</p>
<p>Li Longzhang Confesses to the Massacre Later, Zhou Enlai learned that Gu was detained in Beijing, and his defection had not been killed. He went to Gu's wife Zhang to ask, "Your husband has now been arrested. If he defects and is not killed, he will definitely become an official in the future and will definitely leak the Party's secrets. If your husband takes you to Beijing, what will you think in your heart when you see your husband?" Gu's wife replied that she would naturally obey her husband's wishes. Zhou heard Gu's wife's reply and immediately had the heart to kill her. That night, he ordered his comrades to help him kill Gu's entire family and relatives and bury the corpses to destroy the traces. Zhou also fled without a trace. This time, the Hankou authorities arrested Zhou's accomplice Li Longzhang. After repeated severe interrogation, he confessed to killing Gu Shunzhang's entire family and the location of the corpses. According to the confession, the authorities sent a telegram to the French police in this city to investigate, and the case was solved and the corpses were exhumed. Although seven men and women were exhumed yesterday, the original telegram said that there were nine corpses, so they are still being exhumed.</p>
<h3 id="e157">More Corpses Hidden in Xiude Lane <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>According to the confession of the captured accomplice Li Longzhang, the number of people killed at that time was as many as eleven. It is said that Si Li, the commander of the Second Division of the 26th Army, and his younger brother Si Li were also among them. In addition to the two stars in Yaozhu Road, four corpses were buried at the same time in the house No. 6, Xiude Lane, Jiaozhou Road, Public Concession. The competent police station has been notified to excavate, but it is not known for sure. As for the seven corpses that have been exhumed, they are Gu Weizhen (Gu Shunzhang's historical age 31 years old), Wu Kechang and his wife (Gu Shunzhang's sister-in-law's younger brother and sister-in-law), Wu (Gu Shunzhang's sister-in-law), Zhang Aibao (Gu Shunzhang's wife's younger sister), Zhang Atao (Gu Shunzhang's father-in-law, 59 years old), and a pockmarked servant (surname unknown), seven people. There are also Gu's wife Zhang Xinghua (21 years old), Gu's mother-in-law and the Si brothers, four corpses, which have not yet been found. If there are four corpses at No. 6 Xiude Lane, Jiaozhou Road, which the murderer confessed to, if they can be found, the numbers will match.</p>

<p>Despicable Beyond Redemption</p>
<p>After the Chairman of Heilongjiang Province, Ma Zhanshan, led his subordinates and worked hard to kill the enemy, he was in urgent need of supplies and financial assistance due to the lack of food and salaries. This aroused the enthusiastic response of groups, organizations, and schools in various cities, who raised funds to be remitted to the front line for emergency relief and to increase strength. There was a Ningbo person named Hai Arong who came up with a whimsical idea to collude with his friend Hu Ronggui and others to gather and set off on the streets every day to solicit donations from various shops and residents to rescue the Heilongjiang soldiers' military salaries. After the shops, etc. happily donated, Mei and others gave each a receipt, and many people were deceived. At about 11:00 a.m. yesterday, Mei and others were soliciting this donation in Wang Senji Redwood Workshop, No. 53 Sangyuan Street, outside Xiaonanmen. The owner, a Wenzhou native named Wang Ashou, saw that these people were wearing military uniforms, like soldiers, but he had never heard of people from the military soliciting donations outside. He carefully observed that there were many ambiguities in their words, which was very suspicious. He immediately said to Mei that if this donation was really used to help the Heilongjiang soldiers, he would do his best to donate. Please trouble him to go to the nearby post with him and ask the police for the facts, and then he could succeed. At that time, Hu Ronggui, who was standing next to Mei, heard what Wang said and knew that things were not good, so he immediately ran away. Mei's face turned pale and he was restless. Wang saw this and knew that he was a fraud, so he grabbed him and called the police Kong Xiande, who brought him back to the third section of the first district. The gold director took the case. During the preliminary trial, Mei Arong confessed that he was entrusted by a friend to solicit donations on his behalf, and all the donations were handed over to him, and he only provided him with 40 cents for transportation expenses every day. A symbol of Wang Guanjia, artilleryman of the Second Row, Tenth Company, Third Battalion, Second Brigade, First Division of the National Revolutionary Army Guard Army, was found on Mei's body, which was obviously impersonating a soldier to take the opportunity to extort money, which was extremely illegal. He was ordered to be detained for verification.</p>

<p>Aftermath of Xue Baorun's Property</p>
<p>Xu Yabo Entrusted to Foster</p>
<p>Xue Baorun, a giant businessman in the paint industry in this city, had an affair with a woman named Wang Xiaomei (some say that Wang was a servant in Xue's house) in Japan. Not long after, a daughter (now three years old) was born. After Run's death, Xiaomei once litigated in court because she wanted to divide Xue's estate. After the case was closed, Xiaomei entrusted the girl and the deposit certificate to Xu Yabo, who is now detained by the Songjiang County Court on suspicion of theft, to foster her on her behalf. Xu then entrusted his relative Wang Yafu and Wang Jinsheng to send the child to Zhang, a rural woman in Xintang, Qixu District, Fengxian County, to breastfeed and raise her. Unexpectedly, the day before yesterday, an enemy fabricated a false report to the Fengxian County Police Team, saying that Zhang's house in Xintang had meat tickets, etc. The detective police went to the house and took Zhang and the child to the team together. The police then sent detectives to Shanghai to inquire at Xue's house and they did not recognize the child. They went to Wang Xiaomei's house and found that she had entrusted Xu Yabo to foster the girl and the deposit certificate. The detective returned to Fengxian yesterday and reported the information.</p>

<p>Letter Urges Improvement of Products to Combat Anti-Foreign Goods Movement</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Tobacco and Matches Industry Association sent a letter to the Greater China Match Company, stating: "Dear Sirs, We are writing to you on behalf of our members Yuan Ji, Heng He Tai, Sheng He, Xiang, Shun Feng Zhan, Qian Tai Chang, Qian Tai Xin, Mao He, Chang Xin, and others, who have expressed their concerns. Since the Japanese bandits forcibly occupied Shenyang and Liaoning, behaving barbarically, our countrymen have been unable to endure it any longer. With resolute determination and based on our conscience, we have voluntarily boycotted foreign goods and implemented economic disengagement as an invisible resistance. The establishment of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association prevents unscrupulous merchants from taking advantage of the situation. Our members uphold the long-standing aspiration to promote domestic products as an inherent duty. Matches, in particular, are a daily necessity that has long been dominated by foreign goods, resulting in a significant outflow of money. Since the foreign aggression became urgent, the patriotic spirit of our people has become even stronger, leading to a remarkable increase in the sales of domestic matches. The only regret is that the fundamental supply cannot be fully met, and prices are even raised during times of need. It is important to understand that problems arise when goods are frequently out of stock. Such measures are truly inappropriate. Some foreign goods, affected by the boycott, are trying every means to take advantage of the opportunity, cater to the psychology of the industry, and use various tricks to restore their position. We have heard that several preferential terms have been offered, including: (1) significant price reductions, (2) ample supply of goods, (3) delivery of goods to the stores, (4) credit terms of one month, and (5) exceptional preferential treatment, banquets, and gatherings to foster goodwill. The intention is to entice our colleagues with joy and satisfaction, and to fall for their schemes, disregarding our domestic matches and causing them harm. However, our colleagues adhere to righteousness and will not be tempted by profit, disregarding our domestic matches and causing them harm. However, there are those who may be swayed by their persuasion. At this critical moment, our members are deeply concerned and cannot remain silent. Therefore, we are sending this special letter jointly to detail the above situation and urge your association to promptly forward it to the Greater China Match Company, urging them not to ignore it. In line with the purpose of saving the nation and the public opinion of the industry, we request that you do your best to ensure the supply of goods for export and strive for excellence in manufacturing. This is essential to compete with foreign goods. We also request that you publicize the Greater China's reply to the association in the market to satisfy public expectations. This is of utmost importance." Based on this, we are sending this special letter for your attention, hoping that you will investigate and reply as soon as possible for our disclosure to satisfy the public's expectations. This is our sincere hope."</p>

<p>Sama Samarinda in the Dutch East Indies is a major port in East Borneo, very close to Mahakam, which produces a large amount of oil. The local products are mainly timber, rattan, bird's nests, and monkey bezoar. Since Mr. Chen Qinglian took over as the principal of the local Chinese school, it has been thriving. Although Southeast Asia has been in a slump in recent years, the school has been able to cope with ease. Mr. Chen, in view of the abundance of virgin forests and timber resources in East Borneo, took a route through Hong Kong to Shanghai in the middle of this month to investigate the demand for timber in Shanghai in preparation for setting up a factory after returning to the south. Someone met Mr. Chen at the Great Eastern Hotel and learned about the recent situation in Southeast Asia and the abundance of timber production in East Borneo in detail. He also said that he planned to go to Beijing in a few days and, after returning to Shanghai, visit major factories in Shanghai with his old friend Tan Chao Yi and others.</p>

<p>The case between female star Hu Die and her former fiancé Lin Xuehuai regarding the termination of their engagement and debt disputes, Hu Die in the first instance requested the termination of the engagement and a total of more than 4,000 yuan in losses and debts.

Because both parties did not appear in court and the evidence still needed to be investigated, the date was changed. Recently, it was heard that the court has clarified whether Hu Die's company's books were burned and whether Lin Xuehuai had 600 yuan in savings at the Hongkou branch of the Shanghai Bank. The hearing is scheduled to continue on the afternoon of the 25th of this month. Hu Die also filed a collateral appeal for the loss of 1,000 yuan.

<p>Jiang Yu Damaged in Collision The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiang Yu vessel, on its trip from Jiujiang to Shanghai, encountered the Dredging Bureau's small boat Li Fu, towing multiple barges, while entering the waterway at Jingqiao. As the two vessels approached, the Jiang Yu sounded its horn, instructing the Li Fu to yield. At that moment, the Jiang Yu had a French warship berthed alongside, leaving no room to maneuver. Consequently, the Li Fu struck the Jiang Yu forcefully, damaging its winch. The Jiang Yu then returned to the Jinliyuan wharf to inspect the damage, make repairs, and file a claim for compensation with the Dredging Bureau.</p>
<p>Gong Ping Needs Repair The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Gong Ping vessel, on its trip to Yingkou to load cargo, moored at the wharf after arriving in Yingkou. Unexpectedly, the Jardine Matheson Company's Hengshan Muller vessel also arrived in Yingkou and, due to negligent navigation, struck the Gong Ping vessel's fore section, breaking the ribs of the forward hold. The Gong Ping has already returned to Shanghai yesterday and will enter the dock for repairs immediately. A claim for compensation has been filed with Jardine Matheson.</p>
<p>Continued Increase in Shallow Draft Fees The water level in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River has recently decreased sharply, making it more difficult for vessels to load and unload cargo. Vessels exceeding 1,000 tons can no longer navigate upstream and must transfer cargo at Hankou. Not only are the procedures numerous, but the loading fees are also increased. Therefore, freight rates must be increased during times of shallow water. This year's shallow water fees were increased by 50% at the beginning of the month. Due to the continued decline of water levels from Hankou to Yichang, making navigation difficult, the six companies decided to add another 20% from today to compensate. When the previous price increase for lumber transported from Shanghai to Hankou, etc., was implemented, it was not included. Now, the six companies have decided that, starting next week, the original price will be increased by about 30%. All customs brokers have been notified to implement this. The detailed list of prices is as follows:</p>
<p>Per 1,000 feet, Zhenjiang, original price 5 taels 5, new price 6 taels 85. Nanjing, original price 7 taels, new price 8 taels 50. Wuhu, original price 8 taels, new price 9 taels. Jiujiang, Hankou, original price 10 taels, new price 13 taels.</p>

<p>Jia Xiufang and Feng Qiaoyun, female students of the Shihuaye School in the inner city, went out for a walk in a fit of pique at home. Unexpectedly, they were lured into a hotel in the concession by Wang Guozhen and two other men in Western suits. Later, because the three men could not divide the spoils evenly, a conflict occurred. As a result, only Wang enjoyed it. Two days later, they planned to take the women to Suzhou, but Feng Qiaoyun was handed over to an accomplice and taken away. Wang took Jia by rickshaw south toward the beach, which was not the way to Suzhou. The place was full of pier heads, and they wanted to take her overseas. Unexpectedly, Jia's relatives saw them and forced her to return home. When they were near her home at Sanpailou in the inner city, Wang Guozhen was still chasing behind.

Before long, Feng's father, Feng Ziqing, also filed a complaint requesting the return of his daughter. Yesterday morning, the precinct sent them to the local court, where Prosecutor Wu opened a preliminary hearing. According to Jia Xiufang's confession, she was seventeen years old, from Nanjing, and lived at Sanpailou in the inner city. She and Feng Qiaoyun were classmates. The day before yesterday, she went for a walk without anything to do and got lost. Unexpectedly, the defendant, the third person, followed behind and repeatedly called "sister, don't worry, we can take you there quickly." She was then taken to a hotel, where Wang Guozhen raped me six times. Later, he took me out and hired a rickshaw without saying where he was going. Feng Qiaoyun was abandoned. Wang said he would take me to Suzhou, etc. When questioned, Wang Guozhen confessed that he was twenty-one years old, from Suzhou, and admitted the rape without denial. He also said that because he had no wife, he took Jia Xiufang to Suzhou to be his wife. As for Feng Qiaoyun, he did not know how she was lost, and he could not hand her over, asking for leniency. Feng Ziqing and Jia Baocun requested a heavy sentence and to recover Feng Qiaoyun. The official then ordered the defendant to be detained and ordered to bring Feng Qiaoyun to court for verification. Jia Xiufang was taken back by her father for custody.</p>

Their tyrannical actions are intolerable to heaven and earth and enrage both gods and men. Chairman Ma Zhan-shan defends Heilongjiang with his isolated army, fighting bloody battles. However, due to overwhelming odds, they suffered a tragic defeat. We hear that you, sir, are personally leading a mighty army northward to annihilate the enemy and win glory for the nation. We are deeply overjoyed. However, speed is of the essence in war, as ancient books state. On what day will you swear to launch the expedition? Our district branch will offer refreshments and provisions, and we will go to the front lines to wish you a swift victory. Respectfully, the 17th District branch of the Shanghai Special District Citizens' Federation." In addition, regarding Japanese ruffians causing trouble in this district, a request for local authorities to guarantee security was submitted yesterday to the Chinese Taxpayers' Citizens' Federation, stating: "Submitting a report on Japanese conspiracies and requesting thorough security guarantees. The national situation is increasingly precarious, and people's hearts are tense. Our district is located in a strategic area and is a gathering place for the Japanese. The tearing down of slogans has happened more than once as a result of Japanese ruffians' violence. Recently, we heard that the Japanese are again using ruffians, offering rewards for those who tear down slogans. We also heard that many people are responding. The despicable and base methods of the Japanese can be described as meticulous. If they are allowed to carry out their plans, it will not only infringe upon the patriotic movement of citizens abiding by the law but also may disrupt local order. In addition to notifying all members to abide by laws and regulations and to listen to the handling of the matter by local authorities, the branch should report to your association and request that the Shanghai Municipal Council, etc., be consulted to formally propose preventative measures, which is also to maintain the security of this port."</p>

<p>Seamen's Union: The Chinese Seamen's Reorganization Committee yesterday telegraphed the Fourth National Congress of the Kuomintang of China in Nanjing, stating: "Having read in the newspapers that Zhang Xueliang was elected as a Central Supervisory Committee member, we are deeply saddened. The brutal Japanese invaded and occupied our three northeastern provinces. Zhang Xueliang, possessing hundreds of thousands of soldiers, lost thousands of miles of territory in a blink of an eye with the words 'no resistance,' creating an unprecedented humiliation in our country's thousands of years of history. Furthermore, his usual excessive singing, dancing, and debauchery, and the darkness of politics and the suffering of the people in the three northeastern provinces, were all bestowed by Zhang Xueliang alone. The government did not immediately punish him, hoping for a future effect to redeem his sins. However, the people of the country have long been disgusted and abandoned him together. The Kuomintang of China is the highest authority leading the national revolution, and the position of Central Supervisory Committee is of utmost dignity. However, Zhang Xueliang's election is a loss to the wishes of the people of the whole country and all party members. Our people, in order to respect the dignity of the Kuomintang of China and to uphold the history of the Kuomintang of China, earnestly request that your congress propose the revocation of Zhang Xueliang's election and hand it over to the first plenary session of the Central Executive Committee for execution. This is a sincere hope, not for any personal gain, but to fight for justice for the survival of our Chinese nation. The telegraph cannot express the extent of our indignation. Respectfully, the Chinese Seamen's Reorganization Committee."</p>
<p>Various Labor Unions: The First District Shipbuilding Industry Union, the Fifth District Match Industry Union, the Fifth District Shipbuilding Industry Union, the Shanghai Egg Industry Union, the Third District Cotton Textile Industry Union, the Ninth District Water Transport Industry Union, the Fifth District Cotton Textile Industry Union, the First District Lighterage Industry Union, the Municipal Dyeing Industry Trade Union, the Fourth District Cigarette Industry Union, the Newspaper Delivery Industry Union, the Sixth District Knitting Industry Union, the Second District Knitting Industry Union, the Fourth District Lighterage Industry Union, the Ink Manufacturing Industry Union, the Eighth District Cotton Textile Industry Union, the Simple Book Industry Union, the Municipal Toothbrush Industry Union, the Seventh District Cotton Weaving Industry Union, the Fifth District Cigarette Industry Union, the Postal Workers' Union, the Postal Employees' Union, the Municipal Publishing Industry Union, the Pharmaceutical Industry Union, the First District Water and Electricity Industry Union, and more than sixty other labor unions declared in support of the workers of the Dahua Match Factory: "The interests of labor are the crystallization of blood and sweat, and the demands of labor are not contrary to the law. The capitalists of the Dahua Match Factory only care about their own interests and disregard the suffering of the workers. The government clearly ordered that wages should be paid as usual for the shutdown on the Double Tenth National Day, and the Factory Law was promulgated afterward. All factories, both Chinese and foreign, should strictly follow these regulations. However, the factory not only refused to pay as usual but also used the militia to implement oppression and dismissed a large number of loyal workers. Party and government agencies have conducted impartial mediation, but the factory manager has evaded the issue and refused to deal with it. We, as workers, cannot bear to sit idly by. In addition to fully supporting the workers of the factory to fight for the final victory, we hereby declare."</p>

Yesterday at 2:00 PM, a general membership meeting was held in the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce hall. More than 400 people attended, including representatives from various groups and guest members. On this day, because workers from various departments had difficulty attending due to their job duties and transportation, 60 representatives were first selected on the spot according to the example of workers from each department. In the future, the council and supervisors will be elected from these representatives to assume the responsibility of the entire union. It is said that officials from the department will be present to guide and supervise the election at that time.</p>

<p>To the Editor: On the 6th of this month, your newspaper published a recruitment notice for China Merchants Steam Navigation Co. personnel, which included the statement: "Recently, crew members of the Gongping, Xinfengjiang, Huajiang, and Jingjiang ships, including Zou Weixin, Qian Xiangshan, Cheng Jinsheng, and Yu Gaoming, were dismissed and had their salaries withheld without cause, leading to disturbances at the bureau and various disputes. Li Yunchen has not been to the bureau for four days to handle matters." Our association believes that this matter concerns the reputation of our members, so we conducted a thorough investigation. We learned that Zou Weixin, also known as Zou Liangen, had already been reinstated to his original position on the Jianghua ship during Section Chief Zeng's tenure. Qian Xiangshan, also known as Qian Xiangshan, resigned on his own due to other employment opportunities. Cheng Jinsheng, also known as Cheng Jingchu, had already left his position due to an incident. Yu Gaoming, also known as Yu Gaoming, denied requesting a salary increase and publishing a notice. Ship Affairs Section Chief Li Yunchen, also known as Li Yuncheng, is being treated in the hospital due to overwork and illness and is not absent from the bureau due to this matter. The facts in your newspaper's report are inconsistent with the actual situation. We are deeply concerned that the outside world will not understand the truth, leading to misunderstandings. We are writing to request that your editor make a correction. We would be grateful. Respectfully, the China Marine Engineers' Association, November 23rd.</p>

<h3 id="e197">Mr. Ni Baokuan's Message (Opposing Public Sale of Japanese Goods) <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>Since the brutal Japanese invaded our Northeast on September 18, occupying our land and killing our people, in just a few days, more than 2,000 miles of land and more than 20 million people in our Liaoning and Jilin provinces have been completely under the trampling of the brutal Japanese. Our people across the country, filled with righteous indignation, have spontaneously risen up, resolutely boycotting Japanese goods and practicing economic severance, originally as a conscientious action of self-defense to resist the brutal Japanese aggression. However, the brutal Japanese have not awakened themselves. On the one hand, they are advancing troops in northern Manchuria, and after occupying Liaoning and Jilin provinces, they are further seizing Heilongjiang with military force. On the other hand, they are organizing plainclothes teams with extremely cunning means to disrupt our important northern commercial port of Tianjin. This is still something that everyone can see on the surface. Their most malicious plan is to pressure our government in the diplomatic arena to recognize the prohibition of all anti-Japanese speech and behavior, wanting to make our 400 million people not allowed to have a single word or action of resistance, and to be loyal slaves of Japan forever. Under this situation, fortunately, General Ma Zhanshan, chairman of the Heilongjiang Provincial Government, is fighting alone, unyielding in the face of setbacks, preserving the personality of our Chinese nation. Regardless of success or failure, it will ultimately be the glory of our Chinese nation's history. At the same time, unfortunately, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has a proposal to publicly sell Japanese goods by the Committee for Economic Severance with Japan. May I ask, the northeastern soldiers, under the leadership of General Ma Zhanshan, are resisting the brutal Japanese invasion on the battlefield with their flesh and blood. However, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the leader of the national chamber of commerce, is advocating the public sale of Japanese goods, disregarding the righteous indignation of the people of the whole country. This must be refuted with condemnation. The only reason that the association advocates the public sale of Japanese goods is to use economic difficulties as an excuse to create alarmist talk. It is said that in Shanghai, there are 11 million yuan worth of Japanese goods stored in the hands of Chinese merchants. If they are not cleared through public sale, there will inevitably be a financial crisis. However, according to the investigation of facts, the maximum value of Japanese goods sealed in the largest stores and all stores on Nanjing Road in Shanghai is only 20 million yuan. Since China and Japan are close in proximity and transportation is convenient, Japanese goods are shipped to China and sold immediately. The estimated value of Japanese goods stored in Shanghai is 20 million yuan, which is enough for one month of sales. The so-called 11 million yuan worth of stored Japanese goods is actually deceiving the people of the country. This must be refuted with condemnation. Furthermore, from an economic perspective, there are sufficient reasons why a public sale cannot be conducted. Currently, the estimated value of Japanese goods sealed in Shanghai is 20 million yuan. This seems to be uneconomical, but in reality, it is not. After the repeated boycotts of Japanese goods are lifted, a large number of Japanese goods will inevitably come in. Therefore, if the Japanese goods are sealed and not sold publicly, the source of imported Japanese goods will stop. Even if unscrupulous merchants want to buy and sell, they will be deterred by social sanctions and will not dare to. If a public sale is implemented, even if the boycott is not lifted, unscrupulous merchants, eager for profit, will seize the opportunity, and some people, seeing the cheap sale of Japanese goods, will exchange money for Japanese goods. Once this trend starts, Japanese goods will come in steadily, and social sanctions will lose their effectiveness. From then on, hundreds of millions of yuan worth of Japanese goods can be sold every year, and the economic loss will be ten or a hundred times more than 20 million yuan. Businesses always have some inventory. Even if Japanese goods are sealed today, non-Japanese goods can still be sold well. After Japanese goods are sealed, the number of non-Japanese goods will inevitably decrease. Therefore, even if businesses have some Japanese goods sealed, there is still no economic problem. If a public sale is implemented, it will be equivalent to continuing to provide financial assistance to the brutal Japanese, which they can use as tools to kill our people. Those who advocate a public purchase either have ulterior motives or are committing suicide. This must be refuted with condemnation. In short, Japanese goods cannot be sold publicly unless a satisfactory resolution is reached in the negotiations between the two countries. This is a principle that our people across the country must adhere to. Any kind of public sale method, no matter how disguised, is giving the Japanese the means to kill us, and is a manifestation of our people's lack of blood, lack of personality, and willingness to be slaves. Alas, General Ma Zhanshan is leading the soldiers of the Northeast with the spirit of fearing no death, sacrificing their lives to continue resisting the brutal Japanese invasion. Those of us across the country who express sympathy for General Ma Zhanshan, can we bear to buy Japanese goods with money at this time? While we still have breath, this ambition must not be relaxed even a little. Our people, let us continue to work hard, and do not let the Japanese mock us for being a five-minute wonder. I hope my words do not come true.</p>

<h3 id="e199">Is Japan's Population Overcrowded? Wind. <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>By studying the aspect of savings, it is very clearly shown that Japan's population is not overcrowded. Please see the table below:</p>
<p>Year Population Savers Savings</p>
<p>1912 100 100 100</p>
<p>1913 101 105 105</p>
<p>1914 103 108 104</p>
<p>1915 104 108 105</p>
<p>1916 106 116 126</p>
<p>1917 107 129 171</p>
<p>1918 108 147 238</p>
<p>1919 109 168 315</p>
<p>1920 110 184 362</p>
<p>1921 112 201 459</p>
<p>1922 113 212 469</p>
<p>1923 115 226 516</p>
<p>1924 116 294 461</p>
<p>1925 117 236 586</p>
<p>According to the 1912 statistics, Japan's population was 51,753,934, the number of savers was 11,976,223, and the total amount of savings was 192,506,798 yuan. Moreover, (the economic well-being of a country's people and the issue of a country's population being overcrowded or underpopulated are determined by the economic status of the majority of the people. The so-called majority of the people refers to wage earners (including farmers in Japan). If the savings of these people increase day by day, then their economic status is also improving. This is an undeniable fact). Judging from the savings table above, these statistics are very noteworthy, because the table shows the rise and fall of Japanese commerce, which in reality has little impact on the economic status of wage earners).</p>
<p>However, whether we examine it from a geographical or productive perspective, we cannot find any arguments for (Japan's population being overcrowded). Even if we ask the Japanese, they do not understand where the evidence is. Not only can they not say it or produce it, but they may only be able to put on a barbaric face and shout loudly, insisting on the old saying that (Japan's population is overcrowded). But from an objective standpoint, we can only acknowledge that Japan's population growth rate is very fast (but the increase in economic well-being that accompanies it is even faster). Are the Japanese full? The Japanese want to learn from Germany between 1875 and 1914.</p>

Now, the company's recently produced revolutionary epic film (Maritime Heroes) has been completed. The plot of the film is tense and stimulating. It will be screened publicly at the Central Grand Theater on Sixth Avenue starting on the 23rd to stimulate public morale to resist the brutal Japanese. Its contribution to the country and society is not insignificant.</p>

<h3 id="e202">Donation on the Road <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Chuan</p>
<p>On the 19th and 20th of November, the Shanghai University Students Anti-Japanese National Salvation United Association decided to hold a donation drive from all walks of life to aid the brave soldiers of Heilongjiang Province. At eight o'clock in the morning on the 19th, we gathered in the school, forming small teams of six people from each dormitory room, and groups of two rooms each, plus two female students. Each team was given a small flag and a donation bamboo tube. All the students were in high spirits and set off at nine o'clock.</p>
<p>The 200,000 troops in the Northeast, due to the order of their superiors (non-resistance), allowed the Japanese army to seize the territories of Liaoning and Jilin provinces without firing a shot. Fortunately, General Ma Zhanshan of Heilongjiang, with the responsibility to defend his territory, refused to sacrifice Heilongjiang under the chaotic order. He gathered the province's forces to defend the homeland, winning six battles out of six, preventing the rampant actions of the wolfish enemy. How should we express our respect for this loyal and courageous general? And how should we assist him? We are passionate young people, and we cannot be like the government, merely issuing a few announcements without providing direct assistance. Therefore, when we set off, the team members disregarded hardship and bravely moved forward, doing their work.</p>
<p>Our team of seven set out from Fahua Township, along Xiahfei Road. We walked and solicited donations from passersby and Chinese shopkeepers. We spoke to them with the utmost sincerity, saying, "We are all Chinese people. Are we willing to be slaves of a conquered nation? Currently, in Heilongjiang, the Chinese and Japanese are in fierce battle, but the isolated army in the frontier is facing the strong and stubborn Japanese forces. This is a crucial moment for the survival of China. Can we bear to not save them? Everyone here is Chinese, all patriotic individuals. So, before our country is conquered, please contribute a little to the effort and provide economic assistance." After speaking, we held out the bamboo tube. Some people, after hearing what we said, bravely stepped forward and put money into the tube. However, some people not only did not donate but also deliberately showed an attitude of gloating, extremely despising us, and even uttering some rude remarks. Of course, we did not want to force anyone to donate, but we were not happy in our hearts. We highly suspected that these people were not Chinese.</p>
<p>We walked to Nanjing Road and went to three large companies to solicit donations from the customers. The results were excellent, because they were able to afford to donate and were in front of many people, making it embarrassing not to donate. Especially the women, without us having to say much, took out their money. In fact, they were not particularly more patriotic than the men, but it was a matter of face, and we collected a lot through this. However, one thing made me extremely heartbroken.</p>
<p>We went to the savings department of Wing On Company to solicit donations. A middle-aged man, about forty years old, was depositing 1,000 silver dollars. We pleaded with him to donate some, but after a long time, he still refused. The staff inside also helped us speak, but he remained unmoved. Finally, he even said, "Just be a slave of a conquered nation, why donate?" We could not believe our ears when we heard these words and asked again, "Is he willing to be a slave of a conquered nation?" "Yes, I would rather be a slave of a conquered nation," he said firmly. At that time, one of our team members angrily rushed over to argue with him and wanted to punch him. We did not want to cause trouble and pulled him back. We admitted that this heartless person was not worth wasting our precious time arguing with. He was only fit to be a slave of a conquered nation, only fit to be driven like a beast by foreigners.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, we returned to school. We were extremely tired after walking all day, and our stomachs were empty. However, our spirits were still excellent, and we felt even more happy in our hearts.</p>
<p>On the 20th, news came that the isolated army in the frontier, facing a strong enemy in front and without reinforcements in the rear, with soldiers hungry and tired and lacking equipment and ammunition, had no choice but to retreat to Keshan Town. Heilongjiang was lost. Our blood vessels burst. The government is to blame for the lack of ammunition and the people must take at least partial responsibility for the lack of food. Therefore, when we set off, we were even more excited and worked even harder. However, today's results were worse, because many people had already donated.</p>
<p>A child, about seven or eight years old, was playing on the street with his younger brother. Seeing us coming, he took the three copper coins he had in his hand and gave them to us. Seeing how poor he was, we said to him, "Good boy, you are truly patriotic. You only have three copper coins, keep them to buy something to eat." He still refused and put them in the bamboo tube. His three copper coins were worth more than the tens of silver dollars of the rich. What China needs are people like this, not those heartless seeds of national subjugation.</p>
<p>When we walked to Sichuan Road, a policeman came over and asked us how much money we had raised. We told him that the donations were not much, and we were not being demanding. We just wanted everyone to do their best, regardless of the amount. He said, "You are truly patriotic, not afraid of hardship, sacrificing your time, and raising donations along the way. As for us, who are only driven by foreigners, it is truly shameful to talk about it. However, I cannot help but do it. There are seven or eight people in my family, all waiting for this bowl of rice from me. If I want to be patriotic, my family will have nothing to eat. How can I do that? I am truly ashamed." When he said this, tears almost flowed out of his eyes. At that time, we also sympathized with him in our hearts. There are also many Chinese people who are unwilling to be slaves of foreigners, but because the problem of livelihood cannot be solved, they have no choice but to do so. We should not scold these people but should think of ways to help them. China is indeed lacking jobs.</p>
<p>We went to many places, and many people warmly helped us and guided us. The conductors on the trams automatically allowed us to ride for free, so the work was relatively fast.</p>
<p>On the road, whenever we met other teams, we would ask each other how the results were and encourage each other and compete with each other. The amount of donations, at least, could indicate the diligence of the work.</p>
<p>Our legs were sore, and we returned to school, then lay on the bed to rest. We were indeed very tired, but thinking of the brave soldiers on the front lines, fighting hand-to-hand with the Japanese army, we could not help but feel excited again.</p>
<h3 id="e203">A Collective Cry! <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Xiaoru</p>
<p>It is pitiful that China, with its four thousand years of history, has today fallen into a state of peril. Apart from a handful of cold-blooded creatures, only General Ma Zhanshan leads his brave soldiers in a desperate struggle against the dwarf invaders. Although they have won several victories with hot blood, they are isolated and without support. The Northeastern armies are capable of fighting, but they do not advance to assist. The Southern armies, though developed, may not prevail due to climatic conditions. Now, the generally indignant compatriots gather to donate money to aid General Ma Zhanshan. But having money alone, without strength, is of no avail. Given these various crises, patriotic people cannot but worry that General Ma will be unable to sustain the fight alone. Our school (Southeast Medical College) usually avoids empty high-minded slogans and speeches. Now that national disaster has struck, our school's students, lacking military knowledge, cannot make pointless sacrifices to aid General Ma in killing the enemy. They can only (use what they have learned) organize a medical rescue team to undertake the practical work of rescuing the brave soldiers fighting on the front lines. The motivation for this is not to court social approval through ostentatious displays of patriotism, but merely to fulfill the duty of a citizen. Furthermore, among the more than six hundred students in our school, are these thirty-two rescue team members the only ones willing to do practical work? Because in doing anything, rash action or blind obedience is to be avoided. Careful consideration is necessary, such as whether the team members' medical knowledge is sufficient, whether their physical condition is up to par, and the economic problems. Since this is a matter of personal patriotism, and we are all diligent students, the initial funding was entirely from donations and pawnings from the students. On the one hand, the rescue team was eager to depart, but on the other hand, the rear-area work of the students at school was also important. The hearts of the Chinese people are not dead. People in society have expressed deep sympathy and have generously donated money and medicine. Moreover, female students from Jiaotong University have followed suit by organizing a rescue team to accompany them. Thus, on the nineteenth, the rescue team departed. All the male and female students of the school were dressed in military attire.</p>

<p>Bearing the pain of sending off thirty-two beloved rescue team classmates to serve our country, we assembled on the sports field. The rescue team classmates arrived in their gear, and the whole group paid the highest respects. During the farewell procession, apart from the solemn and orderly sound of footsteps, there was no other sound. Walking to the North Railway Station, a distance of twenty li, the female students showed no sign of complaint, for their entire attention was focused on the survival of the nation, and they had lost all sense of awareness. When the train arrived, the rescue team classmates boarded the train, and everyone enthusiastically rushed and stood beside the second train carriage. At that time, there were also volunteer soldiers from Fudan, Jiaotong, and Guanghua Universities, as well as representatives from various commercial and industrial groups, to see them off, shouting anti-Japanese slogans. At the last sentence, ("Long live the Southeast Rescue Team!"), they were already choked with emotion and unable to speak. After classmate Zhang Gan delivered a thank-you speech on behalf of the rescue team, the train was about to depart, and all the classmates rushed to the windows, shaking hands with the rescue team classmates. Both sides felt a nameless sorrow, and before they could even speak, two streams of tears had already filled their eyes. The female students were even more covered in tears, standing there like wooden figures, as if they had lost all sense of awareness. When the whistle sounded and the wheels turned, the farewell classmates suddenly went wild, shouting ("Long live the Southeast Rescue Team!") through their tears. After the train left, one by one, tears flowed like a spring, almost bursting into loud cries. At that time, it was not only because they were reluctant to be separated from the rescue team classmates going to the national crisis but also for the current situation and future of our motherland. Only science can save the nation. We, the students remaining at school in the rear, are all intensifying our military training to strengthen our bodies, striving to learn, and enduring hardship. In addition to schoolwork, we are also doing propaganda work and have already prepared to organize a second team to serve as the support for the first team of classmates.</p>
<p>This morning, in the first class, the medical chemistry teacher reported that Heilongjiang had fallen. The entire class instantly turned pale with sorrow. When the newspapers arrived after class, everyone read the lines ("General Ma Zhanshan fought fiercely for a day and a night, exhausted his ammunition, and retreated with tears in his eyes; Qiqihar is gone!"), and they truly lamented and cried out together. Commander-in-Chief Chiang has only now gone north, and there is no news of Zhang Fakui's army departing. Others are even more irresponsible. Are they just going to watch as the Japanese steal our country's territory and heartlessly allow the isolated and unsupported General Ma Zhanshan to fight alone and be defeated? My beloved compatriots throughout the country, Heilongjiang has been lost, national disaster is imminent, and the nation is doomed. Apart from actively preparing to fight the dwarf invaders to the death, shouldn't we (cry out together) for the war dead fighting valiantly and for our country, with its four thousand years of history, about to perish! Alas!</p>
