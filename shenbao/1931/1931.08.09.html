<h3 id="c3">工廠是誰的潘仰葊 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>工廠是誰的，照平常想，總是說當然屬於投資的企業家。不過分析起來、，也有多種，企業家靠利潤而生活的，固然很多。然爲事業而投資的，亦屬不少。不然，世間賺餞的事業很多，爲什麽他們不做投機事業，不去販賣洋貨，偏偏來做這艱難困苦的國貨工廠事業。在此一點，可以見到辦工廠的，不是僅爲盈利，而爲事業。不是只顧私人，而爲公衆</p>
<p>依我看來，工人運用心力，盡其所長賴機噐原料而從事工作，滿足他們的生活，一舉一動，關係最大，實在是爲工廠的主要者。</p>
<p>進一步講，社會因工業發達，民生賴以舒展，地方賴以安寗，與工廠亦有重要關係，也是工廠的主要者。</p>
<p>再進一步講，一個國家，因爲民生富庶，社會繁榮，捐稅的徵取，當然增多起來，并且因了工廠發達，跟着工廠起來的事業，也是同量的增多。一方補益國家財政，一方添加國家光榮，無形中更可增進國家實力，提高國家地位，可見國家與工廠，尤有重大關係，也是爲工廠的主要者。</p>
<p>工廠旣與多方面有重大關係，實在是屬於多方面的。故應爲多方面所注意，多方面所愛護，决不限於投資的企業家。工廠的爲盛爲衰，爲成功，爲失敗，爲發展，爲停頓，是大家共負的責任，是大家共有的寳物。大家應該想法扶植他。發榮滋長他，望他欣欣向榮蓬蓬勃勃的有長足的進步，顯著的成功，纔於人於己於私於公，都得到圓滿的願望。</p>

<p>（七）爲災民請命</p>
<p>馬相伯老人·年逾九旬·近當溽暑病後·猶殷殷以水災爲念·苦口呼籲·昨與記者談賑災事·發此一篇感想、（八日專電）爲千萬災黎請命、（八日專電）記者當即筆述其大意·以實吾評·並爲吾叢評之結賴願我國人急起力行·有以副老人之熱望焉·</p>
<p>近以老病蟄處養疴對於世界都不聞問日來偶閱報章。見江南河北。一片水災。十六省區。五千萬人口。槪淪澤國。一種巨浪拍天哀聲動地之慘酷景象。閉目靜索。歷歷如見。陡令余廻憶清道光二十六年時之水災。水塞門戶。余從樓窗登舟。僅乃得救。舉目四顧。惟見波濤萬頃。人畜浮沉。呼聲震野。令人淚墮身之所經。迄不能忘。今已年老。復逢此浩刧。雖幸不身歷。但默念萬千災黎。輒怛忉不能自己。爰力疾略述余感藉爲災民請命。</p>
<p>余以爲近世科學昌明。舉凡水旱疫癘等災變之來。大都人力皆可抵禦。從前所謂「天災流行國家代有」之禍變。已爲今日文明國家所不屑聞。故以科學之力量。抵禦災禍之襲擊。實爲立國二十世紀文明世界之國家應有之建設我國家近年來天災人禍。相洊而至。災象與災民。民年有增加。迄無减少。無歲不賑。今又洪水。舊瘡未平。新痛又至。全民族殆將終不免於死亡。處科學昌明之世界。而長受災禍之襲擊。余眞欲爲我全民族疾聲呼寃。</p>
<p>退一步信。防災不能。如能力謀拯救。猶不失爲亡羊補牢。吾人對於救災。至少應與目前任何要事。有同等注意之必要。而徵之事實。災禍時將二月。賑務委員會籌謀急賑。亦將一月。除首都近畿請得急賑數萬元外。餘都格於財政。一切治標治本之計劃。未見實行。雖曰國庫艱難。但千萬災黎。日夜引領盼待吾人之拯救。望眼欲穿。吾人其將何以慰此忍死待命切望之忱。蓋水災之急一如火災。火在眉睫。萬不容吾人從容躊躇。緩步挑遠水以救之也。</p>
<p>再退一步言之。防災旣不能預計。救災亦未克力行。則消極之不繼續造災。應萬不可少。然而東南半壁之匪禍。北方近日之兵災。其爲慘酷。固亦僅次於洪水。時局杌臬。前途隠憂尙多。刧餘殘生。更將不知歸死何處。國家併消極弭息人禍亦不可能。則人民何貴乎有生。更何貴乎有國。凡此種種。皆吾人今日所應長思。</p>
<p>次之。吾人對此問題。自其表面觀之。人之被災。似若於我無與。但究其實際。則無。一不與我息息相關。人有飢色。野有餓莩。我欲安食。能乎不能。人啼飢寒。我供甘旨。人皆露宿。我獨安居。試一默念。安乎不安目前洪水。有如毒疫荒象旣成。危機暗伏。一旦爆發。即將蔓延不可遏止。故今日賑災。即爲消毒。今日救人。亦即救己。國人於此。其亦善自爲計。</p>
<p>余最欽崇朱子橋先生。棄官不就。致全力於賑災。去冬嚴寒。跋涉陜甘。今夏酷暑。再往視察。此種精神。實爲我人所應師法。余深願國人都具此精神。救人於水火。</p>
<p>余老不能致力。言亦不盡。所欲言者。申報近日時評大抵都巳言之。最後謹以無限熱望之忱。希望吾人弭止人禍。實行急賑。并籌謀預防此後災禍之再發。一致興起。共挽目前之慘刧。（完）</p>

<p>貴州通信、貴州爲僻在西南之一行省、絶少與他省人接近機會、復少相當事業、可以資國人之認識、故今日每舉貴州二字告人、必須藉重於隣省之雲南、而謂之曰雲南貴州、乃能引起聽者之想念、似乎在雲南省之附近、果有一貴州省者在、此非由於匣人之不注意、而實緣於黔人之不　競、不能於事業上對國人有所表現而引起國人之注意也、惟貴州旣爲中華民國之一行省、不在版圖以外、則其社會上政治上之一切一切、悉與整個的中華民國生息相關、决不因偏在一隅、不爲國人注意而自成例外、故貴州現時社會上政治上之種種、實有介紹於國人之必要、倘亦留心西南問題之閱者所樂聞也、</p>
<p>貴州之一切情形、旣久與國人隔絶、故將於陸續介紹其現在之先、不得不略溯其過去、先報告其槪况、庶關心貴州者、明瞭現在之所以有此現象、而便於從事討論、或促其進展也、茲分述如次、</p>
<p>一人民特性與一般生活狀况　貴州遍地皆山、物産豐而少開發、人民多數以手工業及耕種自給、工作稍懈、即有凍餒之憂、故習成能耐勞苦不畏艱險之精神、惜交通不便、囿於見聞、不能擴張其褊狹之胸懷、是以治於人易而治人難、舉凡軍閥官僚之壓迫、土豪劣紳之剝削、皆能勉强忍受、而無反抗之表示、貴州今日之多貪官汚吏、蓋由此養成之也、</p>
<p>二政治　貴州社會、一封建社會也、故貴州政治、亦一封建政治也、民元以來、雖經不少變遷、而政治生命、無不寄托於武力之上、惟見其爲武力之工具、予人民以最深之痛苦而已、政治自絶於人民、愈使武力之基礎、日趨動搖、陷於不安狀態、而人民亦無稍息休養之暇時、故二十年來之貴州政治歷史、蓋無一頁不表現其受武力之支配、無一頁不表現其爲武力向人民之榨取、無絲毫政治眞義、尙何政治之足言、</p>
<p>三軍事　民國初年、貴州軍隊爲數極微、自護法護國諸役、黔省追隨首義、兵額日見增加、由一師而擴成五旅、至民十三四、更擴而爲七師、大都以隣爲壑、給養他省、故貴州雖稱貧瘠、尙不深感多兵痛苦、而軍權統一、亦少割據及互相猜忌防制之現象也、民十五年、袁祖銘率其全部出湘、參加革命、僅留周西成之一師戍黔、袁氏死後、在外部隊爲九軍十軍四十三軍、各自努力、不相聨系、在内之周西成部、亦以一師而驟然擴大、編爲二十五軍、自是而黔軍系統、完全打破、在外部隊、幸能本黔人能耐勞苦不畏艱險之精神、努力奮鬥、雖今百不存一、而勛業固彪炳於黨國矣、現在省内惟二十五軍之一部、由毛光翔率帶、自主黔下簱在省外者計有家烈一部、（二十五軍之一部）在湘黔邊區剿匪及謝彬之新編十師、李伯華之獨立第二旅、王光中之新編獨立十八旅、羅啓疆之新編獨立十九旅、在湖北一帶剿共、黔籍軍隊、盡於是矣、</p>
<p>四敎育　貴州因遠在一隅、交通不便、敎育事業、當然後於他省、益以敎育經費之太微、難資整頓、略具雛形之中小學校、數極有限、所幸地方賢達先進、鑒於需要、捐資創辦之私立學校極多、成績亦較優越、省立各校、因政局之時有不穏、或敎育經費之不能按時或按數發給、致有每况愈下之勢、而敎育中心、純建築於私立團體之上、斯亦貴州特有之現象也、</p>
<p>五財政府貴州爲中國最貧瘠之一省、在民六以前、歲入不過三四百萬元、民七以後、軍事日漸擴張、軍費所需、日漸增大、政府努力開源、收入激增、每年稅捐所入、至六七百萬元、自是以後、理財者以增加稅收、見好於軍事當局、以固其權位爲唯一之目的、竭其所能、迄於今日、歲入已達一千七八百萬元矣、今日人民之生産力、不加强於民六七也、而担負逾前五倍以上、故人民財窮力竭、久難爲繼、政府支付方面、歷無預計算書、雖年有巨大收入、惟聞軍政費之時感不濟、而向人民作無厭之朘削、貴州財政之黑暗、實各行省之所僅有者也、</p>

<p>本年尙無大患</p>
<p>來日亟應預籌</p>
<p>近來各産米區皆報水災、田禾受損、人心惶惶、米價亦逐漸上漲、戊辰社記者、昨至社會局、訪糧食委員會主席馮柳堂君、詢以此後民食情形、承馮君以槪况相告、略謂、</p>
<p>本市民食　向賴各地運濟、其自滬北來者、則以常錫澄靑爲大宗、滬南到者、松江吳縣一帶爲多、自去年豐收、本年無錫各地廠存尙豐、本有過剩之象、即内地田主鄉農手中、亦鑒於近兩年米價高貴、稍有能力者、均思待價而沽、故目前存米、以應目前之用、似可不生問題、何况浦東新粳、已於四五日前上市、雖爲數有限、但新米已出、入心理應稍弱、本月之後、東新可以旺登、西新亦不遠見樣矣、</p>
<p>此後關鍵　在天氣能否晴雨調匀、颶風不作、因此次水災江浙所受獨輕、沿湖蕩田、固已無望、然此等田稻、本來十年難有三四年收成、惟蘆秈本年以水太大、亦難免同受損害、而大宗田稻、能得天氣順利尙有五六分收成、此則聽命於天、尙非人力所可控制也、</p>
<p>各地災害　據報載情形、凡産米之區、俱遭大水、尤以湘皖二省、爲與民食最有關係、皖米（普通稱爲客秈）集中於蕪湖、可以轉口至各省、故皖米受損、各省民食同受影響、此次皖省産米各處、大都遭水、收成歉薄、自在意計中、歷年靑黃不接時、以皖米出新較早、壐以調劑之處不少、本年能否有此希望、則殊難卜、兩湖産米、素負盛名、本有「兩湖熟天下足·吳江熟·一頓粥、」之諺、而今湘鄂兩省、水災奇重、據最近消息、湘省若得天氣放晴、水退迅速、尙有四五分收成、而最近已有禁米出境之令、釐米受匪共影響、收成當不能有十分把握、川省在清代初中華、恒運糧接濟長江下游各省、年來反有洋米輸入、糧産减少、於此可見、惟各地旣遭水災、田廬受損、即使有補救、</p>
<p>來日糧荒　已不可避免、現在所重、固爲急賑、而未來民食、亟應同起注意、否則又將發生如民國十九年之恐慌、或且過之、競辦洋米、徒增漏巵、而依中國目前情形、固惟有飲酖止渴、即採辦洋米之一途、但採辦洋米、亦當　有其道、即如此次洋米報漲、聞係某洋行以本國風災蟲害、加以中國水災、立電暹邏安南産米之處、定購十數萬噸、行情爲之飛漲、華商對外、尙無直接、仰其鼻息、予取予求、莫可奈何、將來　各省皆荒、競起採辦洋米、更予人以操縱居奇之機會、而吾則徒受無謂之損失、所以即使將來欲辦洋米、最好須有準備、能得互相聨絡、不以一時間突起之供求關係、使糧價提高、而能從較有利益之途、吸收洋米、則此項損失之减輕、數亦可觀、是在各省市曁採辦洋米商人之合作、或可實現、目前</p>
<p>最要工作　須明瞭各産米區受災程度究屬如何、與此後之救濟糧荒、大有關係、如受災之成數、及秋收之約數、能由此次各地勘災振災人員、切實調查、後此變化、則由各該地縣政府、督同村鄉閭、隨時調查報告、以至秋收完畢爲止、而此成數約數、務求其愈近實際愈好、彙報於内政部、公布各地、能爲應付此次糧荒起見、由産銷各省市聨合設一機關、通籌合作、使糧食採辦分配、得有一個依據、不致盲動則其所裨益者尤大、不過歷來各省市、於糧食不足時、往往</p>

<p>— 秋水</p>
<p>言語不可粗暴·粗暴則非紳士·然亦不可過於拘謹·拘謹則不漂亮。</p>
<p>語云言爲心聲。然而世豈無口是心非之　哉。此語又作何解。</p>
<p>自由之眞諦。即爲責任。故眞正能瞭解自由者。决不會要求自由。</p>
<p>假使人們能個個瞭解眞理·金錢·和成功的眞意義。那末他就會很自然的爽快·慷慨·和虚心地待人了。</p>
<p>人之智愚不以其經騐之多寡爲斷。而以其取得經騐之能力大小爲準。</p>
<p>在馬路上像老鷹撲小鷄似的看女人面孔的人。未必一定是好色之徒。僅僅的一個「看」字。决不足以滿「好色」者之慾壑。</p>
<p>欲要提高女子的人格。首要打倒奇裝艶服。奇裝艶服。僅能得男子們的愛戀。决不足以取得敬慕。越是要求愛於人。他的人格就越是卑賤。</p>
<p>在中國地方殺死了一個外國人。就可以使中國立刻滅亡。在外國殺死了成千的中國人。結果却無聲無臭。天下本無公理。更無人道。有之亦惟有出自弱者的口中而已。</p>
<p>抵制日貨。並不是因爲中國人的熱度低。只能維持五分鐘。只因爲有許多東西。非仰仗於他不可。故欲永久抵制日貨。最好是提倡國産。</p>

<p>— 履冰</p>
<p>林白上校。此次長途飛行。道經遠東。我國將籌備一種國際上之招待。藉表歡迎。而滬上人士聞此消息。亦莫不以一覩世界最著名之飛行家爲幸。考林白飛行之成功。實在一九二七年五月。當時巴黎與紐約間空中航路。由林白創爲空前紀錄。一時名播遐邇·各國報紙。均盡量登載其事實與攝影。法美人士。尤舉國如狂。林白足跡所及。不期而集者。往往萬人空巷也。</p>
<p>關於林白過去。有一事大足自豪者。即美法間飛行成功之後譨三個月中·所接函電之多。可佔全世界人之第一位。據當時統計。不滿六十日之久。共收到賀函三百五十餘萬封。賀電十餘萬通。贈送賀物約有包裏一萬五千件。歐美各地郵電人員。特爲林白加班工作。忙於應付。殊爲從來未有之現象。</p>
<p>林白旣接得如潮而至之各種函電。按例自應加以裁答。故一九二七年在巴黎時。特租一巨大之住宅。專爲辦理私人酬答之用。美國公使海利克氏。特派書記八人。往助其勞。不意函如雪片。幾令此八人瞠目結舌。無從措手。後乃再向巴黎商會。借用書記十五人。始得於六星期中。發出回信曁謝函二十餘萬封。</p>
<p>上述各節。均載於歐美報紙及雜誌。非臆說也。回憶林白之轟動全球人士也如是。誠可謂爲現世紀航空界中之最享盛名者。余因於春飛經遠東前。舉而出之。殆亦爲閱者所樂知乎。</p>

<p>— 夢蝶</p>
<p>錫地之瓜。有名白小娘者。佳種也。産自石塘灣洛社等處。形小而橢圓。甜瓜之一種耳。其色潔白如玉。晶瑩如雪。芳氣遠播。如雪梨然。味甜而嫩。故有此名。正如荔枝之稱綠衣郎。松樹之號蒼髯叟。而此尤豔絶也。友人昨購以見贈。並附柬云。「郤暑生凉。獻白小娘。毋煩金屋。異味請嘗。如言瓊報。新詩一章。」余受而玩之食之。覺其容可人。其味尤宜人也。信不可以無詩。因口占一律以寵之云。「月樣容華雪樣肌。田間秀出好丰姿。漫將玉體望甘后。應有芳名喚紛兒竊袂生凉消溽暑。瓊漿解渴慰相思。可憐嫁得泉刀客。豆蔻含苞欲破時。」是亦詠物詩之饒别趣者也。</p>

<p>夔門朱君詠葵。有鐫牙絶技。能於瓜子大小之牙板上。刻百數十字。書備各體。余以友之介。得識其人。朱君年甫弱冠。負笈申江。質敏好學。而沉默寡言。不知者未能悉其身懷絶技也。</p>
<p>不侫服務五洲藥房。某日朱君來訪。携鐫就牙章一枚見示。章長不及寸。闊不盈三分。然於其端一面。刻庾信春賦全篇。多至四百餘字。人目且不能辯。然在顯微鏡下窺之。則字體瘦勁。行列整齊。時闔座傳觀。咸爲驚嘆。有同事某君問曰。古人稱彫刻佳者。譽爲鬼斧神。君之技藝。逾於古人。此中殆亦有秘術歟。朱君答曰。此皆欺人之談。余（朱君自稱）七八歲時。即喜奏刀。惟初則僅鐫大者。繼乃由大而細。由細而微。積十餘年之研習。故今已能運用自如。蓋熟能生巧·别無他法也。朱君之言如此。余則以爲一藝之成。半由人功。半由天才。朱君殆過謙言之。然於此更足見其懐才不矜之美德也。</p>

<p>— 袁容舫</p>
<p>近年湖上藕花。當以三潭印月。首屈一指。每至五六月花開。游人麕集。隨園所謂紅藕花深畫舫添也。潭在湖中。來去必藉瓜艇。亭午較熱。余去時非晨即晚。其中屋宇繚曲。花木扶疏。　字亭建在水中。四面通以曲曲石橋。朱欄掩映。如入畫圖。爲賞荷勝處。憑欄四矚。則圓蓋搖翠。長簪綻紅。清芬醉人。如飲醇醪。昔人詩云。消受白荷花世界。風來四面臥當中。於此處可得之。</p>
<p>靈隠風景旣幽。而清凉尤宜夏。自環湖路成。摩托車可逕至迴龍橋外。晨往幕返。交通稱便。故游屐益衆。余每逢夏間。葛衫蕉扇。時徘徊於飛來峯下。飛來峯位雲林寺前。玉屏兀立。奇突屈曲。極瘦透縐之妙。峯上環生古木奇樹。鐵幹枯枝。根生石壑。翠傘層張。成一翡翠棚。祇見綠雲一天。碧蔭滿地。有時風吹樹動。破碎陽光。從樹隙漏出。在山石上閃爍搖曳。作窺人狀。冷泉亭。或壑雷亭中賞飛泉尤趣。濺白滴翠。迤邐曲折。琤琮如鼓琴筑。風颯颯來石壑中。凉氣澈毛骨。心神俱爽。有飄飄欲仙之槪。余每至靈隠。輒徘徊不忍去。</p>
<p>雲棲在五雲山西北。靈隠我愛其空曠。雲棲我愛其幽邃。惜距城較遠。從城中坐摩托車到六和塔。過范村。北行　里。至三聚亭。復百數十武。抵洗心亭。一路羊腸曲徑。俱用石塊舖砌。成碎冰紋。石縫蒼苔濃厚。履之若錦罽。左右脩竹萬竿。參天蔽日。但覺蒼翠撲眸。清凉襲袂。幽麗至不可名狀。余每行其中。特徐步而前。蓋恐佳景之易盡。鳥聲啁哳悅耳。如奏仙樂。洗心亭面北。洞牖雙闢。綠烟浮映。泉聲丁冬。如響珮環。息足小坐。而塵襟若浣。凉生肘腋。幾忘在盛暑時。再進則古樹環擁。雲林寺在焉。</p>

<p>— 姚蘇鳳</p>
<p>像一對新婚的夫婦去度蜜月，什麽都感覺得温馨與甘甜，可以忘記了車輪的震動，可以忘記了旅途的疲勞，好像在極迅捷的一刹那間，便到了蘇州。</p>
<p>依然是車聲，人聲，跳躍在車站的四圍，陸先生並不曾覺得和兩天以前有些異樣，可是丁小姐却懷藏着無限新奇的興趣。車停了，伊從車窗裏探出頭去望望車站上的景色。</p>
<p>「阿要……白蘭……花？……」從混亂的呌喊裏，伊突然領略得一聲可愛的吳儂軟語了；接着就有一陣濃膩的花香繚繞在伊的鼻際。</p>
<p>「買花！」伊喊着。</p>
<p>陸先生正提着箱子預備下車去，分聽得了丁小姐喊着買花，心頭不禁跳了一跳，但是當他斜過眼去望見了車窗外在迅捷地跑將過來的一個提着賣花筐子的女人時，他益發覺得時機的緊張了。</p>
<p>他只得故意把背向了車窗，從衣袋裏　出兩角小洋，急急地丢在小桌子上眼睛望着另外的一面，心裏不住地狂跳。</p>
<p>偏偏丁小姐還拉着他問：「你也要賣兩朶麽？」</p>
<p>「好了！下車去吧！車快開了！」他窘迫到了極點。</p>
<p>在車窗外的賣花女人，當第一項交易成功了以後，伊起初也並不曾注意到這車窗之中站着的究竟是什麽人，但是當丁小姐回頭又問着陸先生的時候，伊從第二項交易的期待之中，不禁也抬起頭來看了一看，這才使伊驚疑起來了。</p>
<p>伊祗覺得那一個男子的背形，活像伊家的小榮，祗是伊不能肯定着那一個男子的確是小榮與否，伊用心注視看，偏是那一個男子始終不曾回轉身來，終於伊自己笑起來了，伊一心祗想；那一個男子和那一個女子是同來的：若眞是小榮的話，他那裏會同着一個很漂亮的女人呢？所以伊就笑着自己的多疑，畢竟提着筐子又去尋旁的主顧了。</p>
<p>一邊，陸先生急急拉着丁小姐下了車，很用心地避免着他妻子的發覺：好容易在人叢之中擠出了車站，他才定下了心。</p>
<p>不料又有一聲尖銳的呼喊，使陸先生更不能不暗暗地呌起苦來。</p>
<p>「小榮丨小榮丨」陸先生很明晰地聽得出這是他家裏的馬車上的小夥計的聲音。</p>
<p>他起初還想裝做不曾聽見，但是，那個小夥計已經站住在他的身旁了。</p>

<p>釐拆價格　（洋釐）早市厘價爲七錢二分五厘、午市加昂二毫半、爲七錢二分五厘二毫半、交易簡略、人心平淡、（銀拆）早市七分、午市八分劃頭加水三四分、銀根形勢緊鬆如故、</p>
<p>輔幣市情　江南小洋、早市爲六錢四分九釐半、午市同價、做出交易、早市二千五百角、午市無交易廣東小洋、早市爲六錢四分五釐二毫半、午市爲六錢四分五厘一毫二忽半、做出交易、早市十三萬角、午市三萬角、銅元勿動、仍爲三百七十八千文、</p>
<p>銀洋進出路（銀欵）昨日銀行收解消息、以週末不及疏理者甚多、故當日收解殊寡、華商收解票欵一百七八十萬、外商一百五十餘萬、各種貨匯稅什諸欵收解七百二三十萬、出倉七十萬、日商銀行收解各欵三百四十餘萬、出倉五十萬、錢莊銀公單收解三千九百餘萬、劃頭欵收解二百九十餘萬、各路滙欵五十餘萬、收現一百餘萬（銀欵）匯劃票欵、做出早市一百五十九萬五千、午市八十九萬、鈔票早市二萬、午市無交易、場外鈔票早市十二萬二千、午市六萬五千、銀行交易、早市互市六十五萬、午市四十萬、各銀行洋戶往來收解一百二十餘萬、鈔票進出一百四五十萬錢莊洋公單收解四百四十餘萬、洋劃頭欵收解一百三十餘萬、拆借洋欵進出一百十餘萬、小錢莊交易三四十萬、</p>

<p>昨日各債劵、現貨交铁極寥落、而期市續跌略勁、賣買人氣稍活、各債成交亦比前日轉暢、前後市各債劵本下月期均開齊、查各公債市價之趨勢、在晨初開出時、以市上賣出交易　潑、雖買進交易亦不寂、但債價盤旋向低、惟趨勢沉定、其穏和情况未異前也、結果比前日二十年關稅約跌八角、二○捲及統稅亦小六角許、其他續跌數角、又二○捲現貨許久無市、昨價比上月中旬漲高二元數角、聞日來債價之所以常趨疲弱者、以某方陸續仍有售出也、計昨現貨交易祇二千元、期貨一千六百六十餘萬元、</p>

<p>美棉預測報告産額爲一千三百九十四萬三千包、本埠人心多數預料其有上漲之力、故市氣較爲穏定、而買進者較衆、市氣堅昂、且有一部份因忽四方水災日趨嚴重、棉田損傷不少而天氣益覺不爽、恐有風潮之慮、全市又有趨漲消息、因此種種購進做多者又見增加、然世界大勢狀况及美棉過去消費而綸、尙有脫離悲境、所以大戶心思、依然抛空、前途仍看跌爲多也、</p>

<p>Central Government Emphasizes Clearing the Countryside</p>
<p>Important Routes Will Be Heavily Garrisoned</p>
<p>Shi Yousan Issues Telegram Announcing Resignation</p>
<p>(Beiping) The military operations against Shi have ended, but there are many scattered soldiers from Shi's defeat. The Central Government attaches great importance to clearing the countryside. After the northern and southern route armies return to their defenses, the key areas of Jinpu and Pinghan will first be garrisoned with heavy troops to reorganize the local areas. The Daoqing Line will be garrisoned by four divisions of the Central Army. Han Fuqu is ordered to be responsible for clearing the countryside in Shandong Province. Post-war military affairs in Shanxi Province will also be handled. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Central Army, including Liu Zhi's troops, will be demobilized within days. The defense areas of Xinxiang, Shunde, etc., will still be taken over by Liu Zhenhua, Liu Maoen, and other troops. The Clearing the Countryside Headquarters will be established in Xinxiang. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Liu Yifei went to Baoding again this morning to comfort the soldiers.</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Jinghui, Gao Weiyue, and You Yu sent telegrams, and Yang Aiyuan sent a brief telegram, all congratulating Zhang Xueliang on his victory. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The headquarters announced tonight: 1. Shen Ke's negotiation for reorganization is ready. The headquarters has appointed Shen Ke as the commander of the newly formed Independent 1st Division of the Army, and the letter of appointment and official seal have been handed over. 2. Mi Wenhe was escorted to Beiping yesterday by Xu Ming. (8th Telegram)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Shi Yousan issued a telegram from De County on the 8th, announcing his resignation, saying that if he were to prolong the war, he would have to withdraw himself. His troops have been handed over to the two division commanders, Sun Guangqian and Mi Wenhe, to be led under the command of General Commander Han. Han and Yousan have shared hardships together, and there is no fear of unrest under his command. Yousan will retire from military service and return to his fields, without regret. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Vice-Zhang's representative, Fan Pujiang, said that Vice-Commander Zhang is very sympathetic to Chairman Han in accepting Shi's troops. After the acceptance is completed and the number of Shi's troops is confirmed, he will return to Beiping to report. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Shi Yousan issued a telegram from Dezhou on the 8th, announcing his resignation, and that his troops would be handed over to Sun Guangqian and Mi Wenhe to be dealt with in accordance with the instructions of the Central Government. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Pang Bingxun, after being ordered to attack Shi, departed from Qin on the 6th. Due to marching on foot, he has not yet reached the Zhengtai Line and is expected to arrive at Shijiazhuang within days. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The headquarters announced the news that the original plan for attacking Shi was to eliminate all of his forces. Shi's troops were said to number 60,000, but excluding plainclothes soldiers, there were actually fewer than 50,000 firearms. It is now estimated that the Northern Route Army seized about 20,000 firearms, the Southern Route Army seized 8,000 to 9,000 firearms, the Shanxi Army seized 3,000 to 4,000 firearms, and the Shandong Army seized 4,000 to 5,000 firearms. In total, more than 40,000 firearms have been seized, which can be said to be a complete resolution. Sun Guangqian and Mi Wenhe have both been captured. Shen Ke's representative arrived in Beiping on the 7th to negotiate surrender. Zhang Xuecheng's troops suffered heavy losses. Except for the two divisions of Sun and Shen, the rest of Shi's troops were bandit troops. Therefore, the main goal of the armies attacking Shi this time was to seize more weapons and recruit fewer soldiers. Shi recruited five to six hundred young students in Beiping, Tianjin, and other places last year, all of whom were forced to fight and whose fate is unknown. (7th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Shi's subordinates Mi Wenhe and Shen Ke arrived in Beiping on the 8th, and their troops are awaiting reorganization. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Xueliang telegraphed to Nanjing on the 8th to report the victory. He recently received a congratulatory telegram from Commander-in-Chief Gu, sent from Xinji on the 4th, stating that after the entire force of the rebel Shi was defeated by our Northern Route Army, approximately 40,000 soldiers fled south in disarray. In the afternoon of the 1st, they retreated to the vicinity of Xinji and Shulu, where they encountered our 2nd and 3rd Divisions. After a head-on attack and encirclement, the rebel army surrendered their weapons. As of this morning, the remaining forces in the areas of Shulu and Xinji have been completely resolved. A total of more than 30,000 officers and soldiers, fifty to sixty mules and horses, and a large number of guns and weapons of various types have been captured. The exact number is being verified. According to the captured officers and soldiers, the rebel Shi's casualties in this battle and those who drowned while crossing the river during the rout totaled about 20,000 to 30,000. The rebel Shi personally led a small number of cavalry and fled without a trace. The majority have been completely resolved. The scattered small units are currently being cleared up. Our 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Divisions plan to temporarily garrison in their original locations. The left wing has established contact with our Western Route Army, and the right wing has established contact with our Northern Route Army. (8th Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e3">Who Owns the Factory? by Pan Yangqian <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Who owns the factory? Usually, we would say that it naturally belongs to the entrepreneur who invested in it. However, upon analysis, there are various perspectives. Many entrepreneurs live off profits, of course. But there are also quite a few who invest for the sake of the business. Otherwise, there are many businesses in the world that make money. Why don't they engage in speculative businesses or sell foreign goods, but instead come to engage in this difficult and arduous domestic goods factory business? From this point, we can see that those who run factories are not just for profit, but for the business. They are not just concerned about private interests, but for the public good.</p>
<p>In my opinion, workers use their mental and physical strength, do their best, rely on machinery and raw materials to engage in work, and satisfy their lives. Every move they make is of utmost importance. In fact, they are the main people of the factory.</p>
<p>Furthermore, society depends on industrial development, people's livelihood depends on it, and local areas depend on it for stability. The factory also has an important relationship with it, and it is also the main owner of the factory.</p>
<p>Going a step further, a country becomes prosperous because of the affluence of its people and the prosperity of its society. The collection of taxes naturally increases, and because of the development of factories, the businesses that follow the factories also increase in the same amount. On one hand, it supplements the country's finances, and on the other hand, it adds to the country's glory. Invisibly, it can further enhance the country's strength and raise its status. It can be seen that the country and the factory have a particularly important relationship, and it is also the main owner of the factory.</p>
<p>Since the factory has a major relationship with many aspects, it actually belongs to many aspects. Therefore, it should be noticed and cherished by many aspects, not limited to the entrepreneur who invested in it. The prosperity and decline, success and failure, development and stagnation of the factory are the shared responsibility of everyone and the shared treasure of everyone.

<p>(7) A Plea for the Flood Victims</p>
<p>Old Mr. Ma Xiangbo, over ninety years old, even in this sultry heat and after an illness, is still deeply concerned about the floods. He has been earnestly appealing. Yesterday, he spoke with a reporter about disaster relief, expressing these feelings (8th Special Dispatch) to plead for the millions of flood victims (8th Special Dispatch). The reporter immediately wrote down the gist of his words to substantiate our commentary and to conclude our collection of comments. I hope that our countrymen will rise up quickly and act to live up to the old man's fervent hope.</p>
<p>Recently, I have been resting and recuperating in seclusion due to my old age and illness, and I have not paid attention to the world. Recently, I happened to read the newspapers and saw that the Jiangnan and Hebei regions are suffering from floods, with sixteen provinces and fifty million people submerged. The tragic scene of huge waves crashing and cries of sorrow shaking the earth is vividly before my eyes as I close my eyes and quietly reflect. This suddenly reminds me of the flood of Daoguang 26th year of the Qing Dynasty. The water blocked my door, and I was rescued only by boarding a boat from the window. Looking around, I saw only vast waves, with people and animals floating and sinking. The cries shook the wilderness, causing tears to fall. The places I have been cannot be forgotten to this day. Now that I am old, I have encountered this catastrophe again. Although I am fortunate not to have experienced it personally, I feel deeply saddened when I think of the millions of flood victims. Therefore, I have tried my best to briefly describe my feelings to plead for the flood victims.</p>
<p>I believe that with the flourishing of modern science, most disasters such as floods, droughts, and epidemics can be resisted by human effort. The disasters that were previously called "natural disasters occurring in every dynasty" are no longer worthy of mention in today's civilized countries. Therefore, using the power of science to resist the onslaught of disasters is a construction that a country in the civilized world of the 20th century should have. In recent years, our country has been afflicted by natural and man-made disasters one after another. The number of disasters and victims has been increasing year by year, never decreasing. There is not a year without disaster relief. Now there are floods again. The old wounds have not healed, and new pains have arrived. The entire nation will probably not be able to escape death in the end. Living in a world of flourishing science, yet constantly suffering from the onslaught of disasters, I truly want to cry out for my entire nation.</p>
<p>Taking a step back, even if we cannot prevent disasters, we can still make amends by striving to provide rescue. Our attention to disaster relief should at least be equal to any other important matter. However, in reality, it has been almost two months since the disaster occurred, and the Relief Committee has been planning emergency relief for almost a month. Except for a few tens of thousands of yuan obtained for emergency relief in the capital, the remaining areas are constrained by finances, and no substantive plans for treating the symptoms or addressing the root causes have been implemented. Although the national treasury is said to be difficult, millions of flood victims are looking forward to our rescue day and night, their eyes yearning to pierce through. How can we comfort their sincere hope of awaiting death and awaiting orders? The urgency of a flood is like that of a fire. The fire is close at hand, and we must not hesitate or slowly fetch distant water to put it out.</p>
<p>Taking another step back, if we cannot predict disasters and cannot effectively provide rescue, then the negative act of not continuing to create disasters is essential. However, the banditry in the southeastern half of the country and the recent military disasters in the north are just as cruel as the floods. The situation is precarious, and there are many hidden worries about the future. The surviving remnants of life will not know where to go to die. The country cannot even passively eliminate man-made disasters. Then why should the people value life? Why should they value the country? All of these are things we should consider today.</p>
<p>Secondly, when we look at this problem on the surface, it seems that the disaster of others has nothing to do with us. But in fact, nothing is more closely related to us. If people are starving and there are corpses in the fields, how can I eat in peace? If people are crying from hunger and cold, while I enjoy delicious food, and if everyone is sleeping in the open while I live in comfort, can I be at peace? The current flood is like a poisonous plague. The famine is already apparent, and the crisis is lurking. Once it erupts, it will spread uncontrollably. Therefore, disaster relief today is like disinfection. Saving people today is saving ourselves. Our countrymen should consider this carefully.</p>
<p>I most admire Mr. Zhu Ziqiao, who gave up his official position to devote all his efforts to disaster relief. Last winter, he braved the severe cold to travel to Shaanxi and Gansu. This summer, he is going to inspect again in the scorching heat. This spirit should be emulated by our people. I sincerely hope that our people will have this spirit and save people from fire and water.</p>
<p>I am too old to devote my efforts, and my words are incomplete. What I want to say is that the recent commentaries in the *Shen Bao* have mostly said it already. Finally, with sincere and boundless hope, I hope that our people will stop man-made disasters, implement emergency relief, and plan to prevent the recurrence of disasters in the future, and rise up together to save the current catastrophe.

<p>France Acts Mysteriously</p>
<p>National News Agency, Rome, 7th: Today, the first meeting between Germany and Italy was held. In addition to the leaders of the two countries, the Italian Ambassador to Germany and the German Ambassador to Italy also participated. The talks lasted about an hour and a half. After the German Prime Minister and others left the meeting, the authorities issued a statement saying that the talks were very harmonious. After lunch, the German Prime Minister met with representatives of the Italian press and expressed his gratitude for Italy's sympathy for Germany and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's unconditional recognition of the Hoover Plan. He also said that his joint visit to Italy with Foreign Minister Curtius was to implement the international goodwill policy that emerged after the Girkel meeting. Therefore, he is very willing to discuss and resolve the outstanding issues between the two countries with the Italian authorities, and with the spirit of friendship and the determination of cooperation, enable Europe to re-enter the broad road from the war-torn state and achieve the goal of construction. Later, the German Prime Minister met with the German press corps and expressed his extreme satisfaction with the welcome he received during his visit to Italy, and especially mentioned that it was a great honor for Prime Minister Mussolini to personally come to the station to greet him. In the afternoon, White Lu Ning and Curtius drove to the Tivoli Villa to continue the talks between Germany and Italy.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Rome, 8th: German Prime Minister White Lu Ning and Foreign Minister Curtius went to the Vatican this morning to meet with the Pope for a long talk. White is the leader of the Catholic Party and is a devout religious figure. According to well-informed political sources, the purpose of this trip by the German authorities to Italy may not be to reach a concrete agreement, but to personally meet and exchange opinions frankly, dispel misunderstandings, and prepare a solid foundation for future international important meetings related to the interests of Italy and Germany.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Rome, 7th: Tonight, Mussolini hosted a banquet for German Prime Minister White Lu Ning and others at the Excelsoir Hotel in Rome, which is known as the most magnificent hotel in the city. This was the first grand event since the German Prime Minister arrived in Italy. After Mussolini raised his glass to toast the health of the German President, he delivered a speech expressing his welcome to White Lu Ning, because the relationship between Germany and Italy in the fields of art and culture is very close. Politically, Italy sympathizes with the various difficulties that Germany is currently facing and is very willing to do its utmost to help, because the situation in Germany affects not only Germany, so governments of all countries must have the determination to cooperate with each other in order to maintain world peace. Finally, he said that the Italian nation, which is currently under the Fascist regime, has been committed to international harmony for a long time, and its policies must be consistently implemented. After Mussolini finished his speech, White Lu Ning stood up and wished the Italian Emperor good health and thanked Prime Minister Mussolini for his sincere welcome. The Italian people have been deeply concerned about the current situation in Germany, and the entire German people are deeply grateful. However, Germany, as an industrial nation, with the spirit of perseverance, will surely overcome all obstacles in the future, which is beyond doubt.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 7th: Restrictions on foreign exchange needed for import and export trade or transportation of goods have been temporarily lifted to avoid unnecessary obstacles to legitimate foreign trade. However, importers and exporters will automatically restrict the amount according to the needs of the current economic situation, paying particular attention to the import of luxury goods. Merchants must also report on the trade involving foreign exchange inflows and outflows at any time.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 7th: The Department of Agriculture has rejected Germany's proposal to purchase a portion of U.S. surplus cotton, but suggested that Germany could purchase directly from the cotton industry. The Department of Agriculture mentioned the Treasury Department's efforts to provide Germany with loans, saying that the amount of loans provided exceeds the amount needed to purchase cotton, so Germany has the possibility of purchasing directly. The chairman of the New Orleans Cotton Exchange recently sent a telegram to President Hoover, stating that the Department of Agriculture's sale of cotton to foreign governments on credit is very detrimental to private cotton merchants, and the price of cotton that cotton farmers can receive next year will also be greatly affected.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 7th: The exchange rate of the British gold pound and other foreign currencies were weak today, which is very strange to Wall Street. The British gold pound telex was 4.85 and 1/6, and the check was 4.84 and 15/16, only 1/8 higher than the cash delivery price. Trading was light in the morning. The French franc was lower than the face value by 1/4. All other European currencies fell. It is said that France bought a large number of British gold pounds here for several days, but recently stopped buying.</p>

<p>Backfires</p>
<p>National News, Berlin, 7th: Yesterday, the Prussian government, relying on emergency orders, forcibly ordered 250 newspapers throughout the territory to publish a declaration urging voters to reject voting to dissolve parliament, forcing the Communist Party, the National Right Party, and the National Socialist Party and other organizations to publish texts violently attacking the policies of their parties in prominent positions on the cover. Opposition party leaders were extremely indignant, and public opinion disapproved of the Prussian government's use of emergency orders as a tool for party struggle. Judging from the current situation in all aspects, this move by the Prussian government has backfired. Not only has it greatly reduced the chance of preserving the cabinet in the future, but it will inevitably cause political turmoil. The president of the Nationalist Party has sent a long telegram to Rome to report to Prime Minister White Lu Ning that if the Prussian government's unreasonable interference with the freedom of voters by relying on emergency orders is not corrected, the party will withdraw from the Federal Cabinet. The Steel Helmet Veterans Association, which initiated the national referendum, also telegraphed President Hindenburg to denounce the Prussian government's oppressive and unfair behavior. The President replied that he had instructed the Federal Government to amend the emergency order restricting the freedom of the press. It is expected that after the President's intervention, the power to forcibly publish official announcements in newspapers will only be enjoyed by the Federal Government. Although this level must wait until the Prime Minister returns home before a decision can be made, it is said that the Prussian government has understood and will no longer take the previous actions. At this time, newspapers are busy speculating on the reaction of this move by the Prussian government to Sunday's vote. Even the Voksiche Zeitung, which usually supports the Prussian government most strongly, said that the Prussian government is very unwise and may put itself in a desperate situation. The Possen Zeitung of the Democratic Party said that this move can only promote the amendment of the emergency order. If it is for the vote, it will only make voters oppose Prussian Prime Minister Blancohr even more. The opposition party newspapers all severely attacked the government, saying that the victory of Sunday's vote is even more promising. A certain newspaper of the National Socialist Party estimated that this move will cost at least two million votes in favor of dissolving the meeting.</p>

<p>National News, Berlin, 8th: A Belgian newspaper described the situation of yesterday's special cabinet meeting, claiming that Belgium may not be able to approve the Hoover Plan in its current form, and said that the cabinet meeting has decided to send a note to Washington again, stating that when Belgium initially agreed to the Hoover Plan, it was conditional. If Belgium's interests cannot be guaranteed in the future, and the clause on redeeming the Mark is not removed, Belgium has decided not to recognize this plan.</p>

<p>Reuters, Washington, 7th: The majority report of the Wickersham Committee, which investigated the entry of foreigners, was highly critical of the authorities in charge of handling the entry of foreigners, saying that they used unconstitutional, autocratic, and oppressive means in interrogating foreigners, and that the strict implementation of the regulations and the deportation of about 15,000 people who suffer hardship every year violate the most obvious human rights.

I believe that the reason why internal and external troubles are becoming increasingly fierce is that the people of the country are accustomed to being perfunctory, which leads to nurturing tumors and leaving behind future troubles, and that the concept of territorial boundaries is too deep, the spirit of mutual assistance is lacking, the meaning of fighting within the family and resisting foreign insults is not understood, and they harbor the heart of watching the fire from across the shore. How do they know that a single hair can move the whole body, and if the nest is overturned, how can there be a complete egg? The dangers ahead are unspeakable. Fortunately, Your Excellency is diligent and cautious, leading the people with a spirit of fearlessness, striving thoroughly, and with a single call, the hearts of the people have changed greatly. Wherever the army goes, victory songs are played repeatedly. Diao Yuan and others, occupying military symbols, pledging themselves to the party and the country, have no excuse, and duty does not allow them to refuse. They are armored and pillowed, waiting quietly for orders. They respectfully express their sincerity, and humbly request your examination," etc. May we rise up together and fight together, uphold our diligence and care, and maintain the party and the country. We are fortunate, fortunate. Chen Diaoyuan, Fan Xiji, Yue Shengxuan, Ruan Zhaochang, Liang Hongen, and their officers and soldiers bow together. Winter.</p>

<p>Fuzhou Telegram: To the *Shen Bao* office: Recently, I sent a joint telegram to Commander-in-Chief Chiang and Vice-Commander Zhang, which read: "Since the closing of the National Assembly, the whole country has been looking forward to governance. However, the Red bandits and insurgents are rampant in Jiangxi and Yan, colluding with each other, harming the country and endangering the people. Their crimes are heinous. Fortunately, our Commander-in-Chief and Vice-Commander, despite their illness, personally commanded the army and planned effectively. The soldiers used their lives, and the Red nests of Ningdu and Donggu were recovered one after another, and the stone insurgents, who were fickle, were finally annihilated. Hearing the news of victory from afar, the whole country rejoiced. We hope to eradicate the roots and eliminate future troubles forever, and to pacify and rehabilitate the disaster-stricken areas. Then the internal troubles will be eliminated, and the external aggression will be curbed. We send a special telegram to congratulate you on your victory and to pay our respects for your meritorious service," etc. We hereby inform you by special telegram.

<h3 id="e68">Actively Sheltering Shi Bu <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Cao Fulin Accompanies Shi Secretly to Jinan</p>
<p>Cheng Xixian Arrives in Jinan, Expressing Apologies</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: After Han Fuju was ordered to shelter Shi Yousan's troops, he immediately dispatched Cao Fulin, the commander of the 29th Division and concurrently the commander-in-chief of the Third Army Corps, to be stationed in northern Shandong. He also added Li Xuande's cavalry brigade, Li Hanzhang's 85th Brigade, and Chen Dexin's 86th Brigade, together with Zhao Xinde's 59th Brigade originally stationed in Dezhou, and the 20th Division's artillery regiment, and Zhao Renquan's local militia in northern Shandong, to defend Guantao, Enxian, Linqing, Dexian, Pingyuan, Yucheng, and other places for defense. On the evening of the 4th, the routed soldiers of Shi's troops first arrived in Wucheng (i.e., the special service brigade, also known as the pistol brigade). On the evening of the 5th, a part of the cavalry brigade, more than 200 people, arrived in Dezhou and stayed at Qilibu, south of Dezhou city. This morning (the 6th) at 3 a.m., Cao Fulin took the "Taishan" armored train from Dezhou to Jinan. He got off the train at Luokou, ten miles away from Jinan, and entered the city by car with one person, and directly reported to Chairman Han. The person only carried a blanket and bedding. Some said that he was Shi Yousan. It was difficult to identify him because it was late at night. However, according to the letter from Sangyuan, Shi Yousan arrived in Dezhou on the evening of the 5th, and Cao happened to leave Dezhou on the evening of the 5th, which matched the time. At 10:30 this morning, Cao took the "Taishan" armored train back to Dezhou to defend his position. According to Cao, Shi's pistol brigade of more than 2,000 people and cavalry brigade of more than 200 people arrived in Dezhou from Wucheng on the 5th and temporarily stayed at Qilibu, south of the city, to rest. Within one or two days, they will go to Lin Yi or Gaotang, the designated defense area, to garrison. Shi himself is missing. His representative, Hu Shaowu, went to Dezhou to negotiate and decided to set up a shelter in Dezhou. Both parties sent people to jointly handle the shelter matters to avoid disturbing the local area. Chairman Han is handling this matter under the order of the central government. After the Northeast Army chased to the border of Shandong, it will certainly not chase again. Shi's troops suffered a lot of losses this time. Heavy goods and heavy artillery were all lost. However, the pistol brigade was in the rear, so there was not much loss. Five or six thousand bags of flour and five or six thousand sets of military uniforms have been transported to Dezhou yesterday for use. It is said that there are probably still people from Shi's troops arriving today. After the conversation, he boarded the train and went north.</p>
<p>Cheng Xixian, Shi Yousan's chief of staff and instructor division commander, came to Jinan from northern Shandong today (the 6th). When meeting with various dignitaries, he was very apologetic and said, "Sorry, sorry, I messed up again." Cheng met with Han Fuju to discuss the arrangements for sheltering Shi's troops. According to Cheng, Shi's troops originally had 50 cannons, 500 mortars, and 500 machine guns, which were almost all lost this time. Cheng also met with Jiang Bocheng and Fan Pujiang to discuss the arrangements for sheltering and reorganizing the troops. Jiang Bocheng had telegraphed Commander-in-Chief Jiang to ask for instructions on all expenses, and a reply telegram was received yesterday, temporarily allocating 100,000 yuan to reorganize the troops according to the actual number of firearms. It is estimated that there are no more than 20,000 people in total, and they may be reorganized into an A-class division or several independent detachments in the future. As of yesterday, more than 10,000 people from Shi's troops continued to arrive in Dezhou, Linyi, Xiajin, and Chengcheng. According to Fan Pujiang, the reason why Deputy Commander Zhang is eager to shelter Shi's troops is to prevent them from disturbing the local area. Therefore, as soon as they arrived at the border of Shandong, the Northeast Army stopped pursuing. Shi's troops have only about 60,000 people. This time, about 20,000 were killed or captured by the Central Army, and 15,000 to 16,000 guns were seized. The Northeast Army also seized more than 10,000 guns and captured more than 10,000 people near the Hutuo River. Shen Ke has surrendered with all his troops. The bandits he sheltered have long since dispersed. Only Sun Guangqian and Mi Wenhe's troops remain, with at most 20,000 people. I will return to Peiping to report after Chairman Han has made some progress in sheltering Shi's troops.</p>
<p>Sangyuan Correspondence: The reporter arrived in Dezhou from Jinan on the 5th. At 7 p.m., he took the train to Sangyuan again. This place is the border of Shandong Province, and further north is the junction of Shandong and Hebei. There is only a public security bureau in Sangyuan, and no Shandong troops are stationed here (only the 26th Route Army has a recruiting office here). From Sangyuan to Botou in the north, there is only one brigade of the Northeast Army Wang Shuchang. There are many troops stationed in Cangzhou. According to the news obtained yesterday, the Northeast Army's supply vehicles on the Pinghan Line have all been transferred to the Jinpu Railway Line to intercept Shi's troops. About 100 routed soldiers of Shi's troops were also found 40 to 50 miles southwest of Sangyuan. The firearms were incomplete. They asked for a small amount of supplies in the villages and left. It is said that they are all coming to Shandong to be sheltered one after another. The Public Security Bureau here has received an order from the Dezhou County Government and held a meeting to decide that if the routed soldiers of Shi's troops enter the border, 1. They are not allowed to enter the walled city. 2. Provide some supplies to let them go to Dezhou to maintain local order. (6th)</p>
<p>Dezhou Correspondence: Shi Yousan's cavalry brigade arrived in Dezhou early on the 5th and stationed at Qilibu. The special service brigade also arrived in the evening, about 200 people. Most of them stayed in the place a dozen miles west of the river. This morning (the 6th), they all crossed the pontoon bridge to Dezhou. They were bareheaded and barefoot, and their clothes were incomplete. Some wore symbols with the words "Fifth Army Group" written on them. Because of the day and night rush, they were extremely exhausted and in a terrible state. They temporarily stayed in Doufu Lane, three miles south of the city, and Qilibu, and have not yet entered the city. Part of its headquarters also came and set up a shelter at the Department Store Donation Bureau in Majia Zikou Street in Nanguan, and set up a special service headquarters in Gong Shengzhan. Today, according to the news from the 85th Brigade Headquarters, Shi's special service brigade has arrived, about 3,000 people. It was decided on the 7th to go to Gaotang and Linyi counties. The brigade's artillery has been completely lost, only rifles are left, and the bullets are also incomplete, only a dozen or so per person, and the rest are thrown on the way. Five thousand sets of military uniforms are being transported from the province to replace them. Only Chief Huang of the Military Law Department, Zhang Aitang, the Counselor, and Chief Ning of the Inspection Department came to the headquarters to handle the shelter matters. They were all rear personnel of Shi and did not fight against the other side. It is said that after the defeat on the front line, they fled from Shijiazhuang. Most of Sun Guangqian and Mi Wenhe's troops were intercepted into several sections. The Dezhou government organs, county government, chamber of commerce, and public security, finance, and construction bureaus jointly formed a support bureau in 30 Shu Street to supply Shi's troops with supplies. Yesterday, 2,000 catties of grass and 300 catties of bran were given to the cavalry brigade, and 200 to 300 catties of steamed buns. Today, the special service department was added, and a certain amount was supplied. There is still no number at the moment. It is said that they were ordered to prepare seven days of supplies.

<h3 id="e70">Japanese Police Arrest Koreans in Sinuiju <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Korean Workers Angrily Go on Strike</p>
<p>Andong Correspondence: According to people from Pyongyang, Korean workers in the area went on strike out of anger due to the large-scale arrest of Koreans by the Japanese police. This has been reported in various newspapers. Unexpectedly, a similar incident occurred in Sinuiju today (the 4th), which is very noteworthy. The reporter briefly records the situation as follows:</p>
<p>When the Sinuiju Incident occurred in Korea, the Japanese police arrested three Koreans due to the protest of our Consul Zhu Fu, in order to cover up our people's ears and eyes. Now that the riots have subsided for many days, the Japanese police suddenly launched a surprise large-scale arrest of Koreans. At the same time, they are trying their best to publicize how hard the Japanese police have worked for the riot. As of the beginning of this month, more and more Koreans have been arrested. Whether they were personally involved in the riot or not, anyone who slightly violates their intentions is on the list of arrests. As a result, the Koreans were offended, leading to a strike event unprecedented since the Japanese rule of Korea.</p>
<p>Initially, the Pingan North Provincial Government in Sinuiju wanted to carry out construction projects, called "Pingan North Province Poor People Relief Civil Engineering Projects". The main purpose of this project is to build Sinuiju City into a major city on the border with our country. The secondary purpose is to build roads in Pingan North Province. Most of the workers are Koreans, with a part of overseas Chinese, and led by the Japanese. It has been under construction since last year and has not been interrupted so far. It is a group work. The strikers this time are the workers of the Maeda Group, a total of 220 people. Since the 13th of last month, they have been building trunk roads in Uminemachi, Sinuiju. The Japanese police have been arresting Koreans on a daily basis. One person in the Maeda Group was also arrested. His colleagues were very angry and went on strike simultaneously at 10 a.m. on the 4th.</p>
<p>After the strike, the Japanese police reported one instigator, fearing that arresting everyone would encourage the trend, and to prevent other workers from striking, they tried their best to suppress it. On the one hand, they tried to cover up the reasons for the strike, because Koreans' anti-Chinese sentiment was to cater to the Japanese, but they were arrested after the event. Therefore, the Koreans were very angry. They used to be accomplices of the tiger, but now they are bitten by the tiger, which is what they deserve. The Japanese did not want to announce the truth about the strike, so they covered up their words, saying that the workers went on strike because of wage issues. In the past, the daily wage for each person was 40 cents, but recently it was reduced to 35 cents. The driver of the truck used to get 3 cents per trip, but recently it was reduced to 2.5 cents. Because of this, the Koreans were dissatisfied, leading to the strike. However, if it was only because of wage issues, there have been many similar events in the past, why have no strikes been seen, but only today? The reason is difficult to understand. Sinuiju has been very uneasy since this incident. The streets are full of Japanese police to suppress it. But it is not known where the Japanese police were when the Korean incident occurred in the past. (August 4)</p>
<p>Suppressing Bandits</p>
<h3 id="e71">Blocking and Suppressing the Red Bandits Fleeing to Western Jiangxi <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Red Bandits Flee to the Border of Hunan and Jiangxi in Three Routes</p>
<p>Chen and He are Assigned to Block and Pursue</p>
<p>Hunan Army Will Also Launch a Pincer Attack in Western Jiangxi</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The Red Bandits in Jiangxi originally numbered about 100,000 people with about 100,000 guns. Its main forces, such as the pseudo-Third Army Peng Dehuai, the Fourth Army Huang Gonglue, and the Fifth Army Lin Biao, were resolved by the suppression bandit army in the battles of Tangtang, Wenhua, Luokou, Longgang, Donggu, etc. More than half of the bandits were eliminated. The remnants gathered in Yudu, Xingguo, Huichang, Ruijin, and Jianghang in western Fujian, with about tens of thousands of people and guns. Now the suppression bandit army is advancing step by step to the bandit areas of Xing, Yu, Rui, and Hui. Therefore, the bandits fled to western Jiangxi again. Even the troops of Xiang Ying and Luo Binghui in western Fujian retreated to Huichang and Ruijin, and then retreated from Hui and Rui to the area between Yudu and Xingguo, and retreated to the border of Jiangxi and Hunan in separate routes. Recently, the General Headquarters reported based on aircraft reports that there were no large-scale armed bandits in Ruijin and Huichang, and the recapture was not a problem. Even Yudu and Xingguo only had a few armed bandits covering the westward escape of most of the Red Bandits. It is said that the escape plan of the Red Bandits is divided into three routes. The main forces of Zhu, Mao, Peng, and Huang will, one, escape from Yudu along the Gongshui River through the north of Ganxian to Chongyi and Shangyou; one, cross Wan'an from Xingguo and Yudu to Suichuan; and one, pass through Taihe and advance to Ninggang from Xingguo. Their common goal is to occupy the old lair of Jinggang or harass eastern Hunan. The vanguard of Zhu and Mao's troops has reached the east bank of the Ganjiang River, preparing to cross the river westward. The atmosphere in Taihe, Wan'an, and Ganxian is extremely tense. Commander-in-Chief Jiang immediately ordered Chen Mingshu's troops to block the Ganjiang River, while He Yingqin's troops were solely responsible for the pursuit, and ordered the Hunan Army to exit eastern Hunan to western Jiangxi and launch a pincer attack on the bandits. It is said that the Hunan Army had long been prepared for the bandits in western Jiangxi. Now that they have received news of Zhu and Mao's westward escape, they have added powerful troops and Chen has stationed troops on the border of Gan, preparing to block them. If necessary, they will cross the border into western Jiangxi to eliminate the Red Bandits. (August 4)</p>
<h3 id="e72">Hunan Merchants and People Oppose the Production Tax <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Submit a Petition to the Provincial Government Stating Six Reasons for Repealing It</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: After Hunan Province implemented the abolition of the consolidated tax, it suddenly lost 600,000 to 700,000 yuan of income per month. Although the central government subsidized 200,000 yuan per month, the monthly revenue from the business tax was only more than 70,000 yuan, so the difference was still large and could not be made up. Government expenses were in arrears for more than five months, and the current situation was difficult to maintain. Zhang Kailian, the director of the Finance Department, therefore submitted a proposal to the provincial government for approval to start a production tax on special items, specifying a total of ten categories of coal, oil, bamboo, wood, paper, etc. produced in Hunan Province, and collecting a production tax of 2% to 5% of the value. It was started on June 20, and it was expected to generate more than 200,000 yuan per month to help subsidize the expenses. However, the United Association of Chambers of Commerce of Hunan Province strongly opposed this as a new tax similar to likin. Yesterday, it especially listed six major reasons and petitioned the provincial government to abolish it immediately. At the same time, four representatives were elected to go to the central government in Beijing to file a petition. The spring petition to the provincial government to abolish the tax stated, "The case investigates the proposal of the representatives of the counties at the Second Congress of the Association. The main text states that the Hunan Finance Department's creation of a production tax on special items is similar to likin and should be repealed. The reason is that the National Government has clearly ordered the abolition of likin and strictly prohibits the establishment of any tax similar to likin. The orders are so strict that they should be jointly observed. Hunan was the first to abolish the consolidated tax and implement the business tax. Your Excellency's love for merchants and people is also extremely exhaustive. Unexpectedly, the order to abolish likin has just been issued, and the order to collect a tax similar to likin has been issued again. The business tax has just been launched, and the production tax is about to be collected again. Although the competent financial officer has a suffering that he cannot but endure, it seems a pity to set up such a name and put the provincial government in a position of defying the central government. In order to respect the law, it should be repealed. 1. Since Zhang Jingyao's scourge of Hunan, followed by the plundering of the Shield Regiment, it has been almost completely exploited. Fortunately, the revolutionary army rose up and Your Excellency presided over the Hunan government. The people celebrated the arrival of the Soviets and were comforted by the hope of clouds and rain. Unexpectedly, Zhang Gui caused trouble in the past, and the Red Bandits destroyed it in the future. The vitality was depleted, and the people were dying nine times out of ten. The reason why they can barely survive is by selling this small number of products in the market to make a living. If the government destroys it again, then the vitality will be cut off. In order to maintain people's livelihood, it should be repealed. 2. Water and drought disasters occur every year. In addition, the bandits and communists run rampant, the fields are deserted, and the forests are lost, I don't know how many. The tax rates for products are all necessary for daily use, such as coal and oil. Even beggars need to use them. Those who operate in this business are only seeking small profits. As for paper, most of it comes from Pingliu, a place spared from the tiger's mouth, and it is again attacked. It seems difficult to feel at ease in terms of sentiment. In order to relieve the disaster victims, it should be repealed. 3. Hunan's business tax has not yet developed and is being persuaded in many ways. Now a new tax is being revived. The people will inevitably become more suspicious. Although various products are transported out of Hunan Province, both business tax and production tax are levied. Who will believe that it is not a double tax? Moreover, avoiding cards is restored again, and there are difficulties everywhere. Even if the government is honest, it is inevitable that there are places where it cannot see or hear. In order to avoid double taxation, it should be repealed. 4. The national tax must be levied on a certain thing that is considered to have considerable benefits or must be gradually prohibited. For example, the income tax is levied because it has net profit income. The business tax has considerable benefits. The special tax on tobacco and alcohol is levied on consumption and poison. The government's prohibition in levy is sincere and profound. If the products are all necessary for people's lives, it is not yet known whether the operators can profit from them. However, local products and exports are subject to extra tax, which is equivalent to importing foreign goods and causing the outflow of profit rights. Hunan's finances are depleted and cannot sell products to absorb cash inflows to seek relief. How can the economy of officials and people develop? In order to regulate finance, it should be repealed. 5. The southwest of Hunan is mostly mountainous, and the harvest is always small. If the government considers the income from mountainous areas to be equal to the income from fields, it feels very unfair. All countries in the world that levy land tax, except for fields and houses, have not heard of taking from mountains and forests. Our National Government has repeatedly ordered afforestation to harmonize the climate and to open up and cultivate. If the government taxes barren mountains, it means that those who abandon mountains can easily bear the burden, while those who cultivate mountains find it troublesome. In order to encourage afforestation, it should be repealed. 6. Measures: (1) Petition the government to abolish the production tax on special items and implement the business tax to reduce the suffering of merchants and people. (2) Ask the government to submit another petition to the central government, considering that Hunan Province is a special disaster area and respects the central government's laws and regulations, it should be subsidized monthly in a preferential manner to make up for the abolition of likin," etc. The conference resolved and unanimously approved the proposal and recorded it in the file. It should be prepared to submit a document to your government for review and approval to order the Finance Department to abolish it as soon as possible to sympathize with the difficulties of merchants and relieve the people's difficulties. There is no end to the wait for orders."</p>
<h3 id="e73">After the Communist Bandit Fu Baicui Turned to the Righteous Side in Fujian <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Yang Fengnian Appointed Fu as the Captain of the Shanghang Security Team</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Since Fu Baicui, the leader of the Red Army in western Fujian, turned to the righteous side, he led his troops to Longyan and pleaded with the 49th Division to allow him to be reorganized. Yang Fengnian, the commander of the 49th Division, appointed him as the captain of the Shanghang Security Team and moved the team to Daxiaochi and Shanghang area. Yesterday, Fu specially sent Lai Ziqin, the director of the team, to the headquarters of the 49th Division to report on the reorganization and to ask for instructions on the future bandit suppression plan. Fu also sent a personal letter to Yang Fengnian to express his heart. The original letter is as follows: "Commander Yang's Medal of Honor, reading the great teachings, and listening to them is very profound. I, Fu, before the 16th year of the Republic of China, was a follower of the Second Democracy Doctrine. Only because of my frank nature and many disagreements with people, and especially my love of restraining the powerful, I was framed by a common enemy during the Purge. I was forced to take risks. When I saw the absurd policies of the Communist Party and the mistakes in the measures, I deeply regretted the recklessness of my previous actions and felt trapped in the mud. I had to find a way to save myself as soon as possible. Therefore, I knew that after withdrawing from Shanghang in October of the year before last, I left the team and hid in my hometown and no longer participated in all the work of the party. In the middle, although I was threatened by the party several times, I ignored it. Recently, because the peasant masses in various places were under the high-pressure policy of the party, slaughtering and plundering was unspeakable. I was heartbroken by what I saw and could not bear it. Therefore, I gathered a group of armed comrades and followed Director Lai Ziqin to swear to fight with the party and save the day.承执事垂爱、寬宥旣往、勗勉將來、承執事垂爱、寬宥旣往、勗勉將來、承执事垂爱、寬宥旣往、勗勉將來、Accepting your love, forgiving the past, and encouraging the future, you also taught me to follow the Three Principles of the People to save the country and the people. I dare not fail to praise the words of gold and stone. I originally planned to visit you as soon as possible to listen to the teachings, but I am a Communist offender who has been wanted by the government in the past, and I am now being falsely accused by villains as a member of the Social Democratic Party. Before the arrest warrant is withdrawn and the slander is clarified, I should avoid suspicion to avoid burdening you. Now, I have entrusted Director Lai Ziqin to report everything on my behalf. If I am understood, please show me a detailed plan, and I will be grateful."</p>
<h3 id="e74">Liaoning Relief Financial Measures <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Issuing Circulating Bonds of Five Million Yuan</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: Liaoning Province has been affected by the world's expensive gold and cheap silver, and the export of agricultural products has been stagnant. In addition, the Feng banknotes are scarce and the finances are extremely tight. The Liaoning Provincial Government, in view of this, believes that in order to maintain public security, it must start with relieving finances. It has ordered the Departments of Civil Affairs, Finance, and Industry to jointly formulate relief measures. They have been submitted to the 231st Provincial Committee meeting on the 28th of last month for discussion. The meeting immediately passed the measures, which contain a total of thirteen articles. The main points are as follows: (1) Issuing circulating bonds of five million yuan; (2) The purpose of the bonds is purely to relieve the finances of the counties and maintain the local market. The circulation period is set at one year; (3) The types of bonds are divided into four types: ten yuan, five yuan, one yuan, and five jiao; (4) When the bonds are issued, those distributed to a certain county will have a small county name stamp added to the surface of the ticket to indicate the difference and avoid unscrupulous merchants buying and transferring them; (5) The bonds are valued at the same price as the current foreign currency in the county where they are circulated and may not be discounted; (6) In addition to circulating in the market, the bonds are also allowed to be used to pay mu donations, land taxes, and miscellaneous taxes; (7) After one year from the date of issuance, all bonds will be collected by the counties and submitted to the province for destruction to avoid abuses. According to Liaoning Province, it issued 20 million yuan of agricultural and commercial loans in the spring of this year. Because the conditions were too harsh, there were very few applicants. This time, the measures have been improved, and the principle of benefiting the people has been established, so that there will be no difficulties and all will share the benefits, and the people will be widely benefited.

<h3 id="e75">US Eastern Travel Group Arrives in Peiping and Tianjin <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>One Group Will Go to Andong from Shenyang</p>
<p>One Group Will Go to Harbin from Shenyang</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: The Eastern Travel Group, organized by various provinces and educational institutions in the United States in the past, has been welcomed by the Chinese authorities for its investigation of Eastern customs and culture. When entering the Northeast for investigation, Deputy Commander Zhang will be sincere in receiving them. This year, they continued to organize the Fifth Eastern Travel Group, led by Uber Tang. Therefore, the group is named the US Uber Tang Clowes Travel Group. It went to Shanghai via Japan and then went north. There are a total of more than 100 members. The group is divided into groups to visit Mount Tai along the way. The first group, about 30 people, arrived in Tianjin on August 1 and arrived in Peiping the next day. After staying for about ten days, they will go to Andong from Shenyang. Another group will go to Harbin from Shenyang and transfer to Siberia. The leader of the group, Uber Tang, also sent a letter to Deputy Commander Zhang Xueliang from Washington, setting a date for a meeting and also meeting with Mr. Zhang Xueming.

<h3 id="e76">Aimee Johnson Arrives in Shenyang <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Immediately Flies to Japan</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: British female aviator Aimee Johnson, who is flying between London and Tokyo, arrived in Shenyang at 1:45 PM on the 5th, accompanied by technician Han Humphreys, piloting the Jason II aircraft. They landed at Dongta Airfield. A large crowd of Chinese and foreigners gathered to offer a warm welcome. The Aviation Headquarters presented a bouquet of fresh flowers, and the British Consul-General, Mr. Isitt, offered a bottle of champagne in celebration. Ms. Johnson and her companion briefly rested in the hall of the Aviation Headquarters. After the aircraft was refueled by the Asiatic Petroleum Company at the airfield, it took off at 2:40 PM, flying along the railway line past the border at Andong towards Gyeongseong, Korea, with an estimated arrival time of 8:00 PM. After refueling, they will fly directly to Tokyo. The enthusiastic atmosphere at the airfield at the time is recorded as follows: Ms. Johnson's original itinerary planned for her to arrive in Shenyang on the 3rd. However, due to weather conditions in Russia, her schedule was delayed. After arriving in Chita on the 3rd, she sent a telegram to the British Consulate-General in Shenyang at 5:00 PM, simply stating that she would arrive in Shenyang on the 5th to refuel. Upon receiving the telegram, the British Consulate anticipated her arrival in Shenyang around the morning of the 5th and informed British merchants in Shenyang and relevant Chinese and foreign parties. At 9:30 AM on the 5th, Feng Yong arrived at the airfield in his own Bili aircraft, and twenty students, led by teachers, also arrived by car to welcome her. The British Consul-General, Yu Zuolian, the European and American secretary of the Diplomatic Commissioner's Office, and Mr. She Naoman, the Shenyang Customs Commissioner, arrived at 10:00 AM. By 10:30 AM, British merchants, both men and women, had arrived in cars and gathered at the airfield. Zhou Dehong, an attache of the Aviation Headquarters, along with members and technicians, greeted the guests. At 11:00 AM, the airfield received news that Ms. Johnson had departed from Hailar Airfield at 4:30 AM that morning. At 12:00 PM, further news arrived that she had landed in Harbin at 10:30 AM and taken off at 11:00 AM, passing over Changchun at 11:50 AM. After 12:00 PM, Feng Yong flew his Bili aircraft 300 li north of Shenyang for the first time to welcome her, but did not see her aircraft. He returned and reported that the weather to the north was poor. Twenty minutes later, he flew out a second time. Bo Lei, a technician from the Aviation Headquarters, also flew north in another aircraft to investigate, but still did not see her aircraft. The wind was blowing from the north that day, slightly hindering the flight. At 1:30 PM, the sound of an engine was finally heard, and Aimee's aircraft was spotted. Feng Yong and Bo Lei each flew their aircraft to meet her, circling once. At 1:40 PM, the welcoming aircraft landed first, followed by Aimee's aircraft. A crowd of Chinese and foreign men and women gathered around Aimee's aircraft. The British Consul-General was the first to approach the aircraft, shake Aimee's hand, and offer congratulations and welcome, shouting "Hooray" three times. The entire crowd followed suit, then shook hands with Ms. Johnson and exchanged greetings. For a time, the crowd eager to see Ms. Johnson was extremely congested. The British Consul-General presented a bottle of champagne and a letter of introduction, which included letters of introduction and telegrams for her trip to Japan, as well as a permit from the Japanese government to enter the country. Then,</p>

<h3 id="e77">Suppression of Bandits Amidst the Flood in Northern Anhui <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Suppression Troops Battle Bandits in the Water in Three Counties</p>
<p>Bandit Leader Killed, Several Hostages Rescued</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: In recent years, disasters have frequently occurred in northern Anhui, and the people's livelihood has been impoverished. During the summer of this year, floods caused widespread devastation, and the disaster situation in the counties along the Huai River was particularly severe. The scale of the floods across the country is probably unsurpassed here. Amidst the vast flood, Fengtai County has also suffered from bandit disturbances, with murder and arson rampant. With natural disasters not yet over, man-made disasters have struck again. Alas, the common people have nowhere to die. Fengtai is located in the Huai River basin. The continuous heavy rains and flash floods have turned the entire county into a watery expanse, with fields, homes, and crops all submerged. The dead have been swept away, and the living have been displaced. It is already heartbreaking and distressing. However, in the areas of Dianzi Market, Gugou Market, Taiping Market, Tianjia Market, and Gongjia Market, bandit leaders Liu Chuanjin, Xu Guanming, Yang Xinshan, and Deng Dagizi led over 500 fierce bandits to occupy and harass the area. They intercepted merchant ships on the Changhuai River, looted the food of the villagers, and after looting, they arbitrarily burned, killed, and seized over 200 firearms from the local people's self-defense corps. They killed a gentleman named Chen and the entire family of a Mr. Su, and there were many other victims. Traffic on the Changhuai River was disrupted. The bandits even threatened to attack Fengtai Zhengyang and other places, planning a large-scale riot. Upon hearing this, Ni Rongxian, the commander of the bandit suppression forces in Shou, Feng, and Huai counties, immediately led his troops on the 3rd of this month, together with the police teams of the Huaiyuan Changhuai Water Public Security Bureau and the independent battalion of the Provisional Second Brigade stationed in Shou, aboard the Fu Bo, Bao Tai, and Ji Hang vessels, rushing to Dianzi Market, Gugou Market, Qijia Market, and other places to assist in the suppression. They surrounded and fiercely attacked the bandits led by Liu Chuanjin and Deng Dagizi, killing several bandit leaders such as Liu Chuanjin on the spot, capturing seven bandits and suspects alive, rescuing nine male and female hostages, and seizing one Mauser pistol, three rifles, and several stones of stolen wheat. At that time, the bandits could not withstand the assault and fled westward. The next morning (the 4th), the government troops continued to pursue. The bandits fled towards Ping'a Mountain. All units advanced by land and water, pursuing them to Taojia Weizi, across the river from Taiping Market. The bandits, aboard dozens of civilian boats, opened fire to resist when they saw the government troops approaching. The government troops besieged them from the steamers. Just as they were engaged in a fierce battle, a torrential downpour began, accompanied by strong winds. The bandits took the opportunity to scatter and flee. The soldiers bravely swam after them, but the current was too swift, and they nearly drowned. They killed two bandits, Cao Chuanshun and Li Wenxue, captured six bandits and suspects alive, and rescued eight hostages. The remaining bandits all escaped. The officers and soldiers of the Shou, Feng, and Huai counties bandit suppression command returned to the Shun Geng Mountain headquarters in Huaiyuan on the 5th to rest. They will wait for the bandits' whereabouts to be ascertained before continuing the pursuit. (August 6th)</p>
<h3 id="e78">Recent Situation in Guizhou <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Guizhou Correspondence: Guizhou, as a province remotely located in the southwest, has very little opportunity to interact with people from other provinces. Furthermore, it lacks substantial industries that could be recognized by the people of the country. Therefore, today, whenever the name "Guizhou" is mentioned, it is necessary to associate it with the neighboring province of Yunnan and say "Yunnan and Guizhou" in order to evoke an image in the listener's mind, as if there is indeed a Guizhou province located near Yunnan province. This is not due to the country's lack of attention, but rather due to the people of Guizhou's lack of competitiveness, their inability to make a significant impression on the people of the country through their achievements and thus attract their attention. However, since Guizhou is a province of the Republic of China and not outside its territory, everything in its society and politics is closely related to the entire Republic of China. It certainly does not become an exception simply because it is located in a remote corner and is not noticed by the people of the country. Therefore, the current social and political situation in Guizhou is indeed necessary to introduce to the people of the country, which will also be welcomed by readers who are concerned about the southwest region.</p>
<p>Since everything in Guizhou has long been isolated from the people of the country, it is necessary to briefly trace its past and report on its general situation before successively introducing its present. This will allow those who care about Guizhou to understand why the present situation exists, and it will facilitate discussion or promote its progress. The following is a detailed description:</p>
<p>1.  People's Characteristics and General Living Conditions: Guizhou is full of mountains, and its resources are abundant but underdeveloped. The majority of the people rely on handicrafts and farming for self-sufficiency. If they slack off in their work, they will face the threat of freezing and starvation. Therefore, they have developed a spirit of endurance and hard work, unafraid of hardship and danger. Unfortunately, due to inconvenient transportation, they are limited in their knowledge and cannot broaden their narrow minds. Therefore, it is easy to govern them but difficult to lead them. They are able to endure the oppression of warlords and bureaucrats, as well as the exploitation of local tyrants and evil gentry, without showing any resistance. The prevalence of corrupt officials in Guizhou today is due to this.</p>
<p>2.  Politics: Guizhou society is a feudal society, so Guizhou politics is also feudal politics. Although there have been many changes since the founding of the Republic, political life has always been entrusted to military force. It is only seen as a tool of military force, giving the people the deepest suffering. Politics is cut off from the people, which further weakens the foundation of military force, leading to an unstable state. The people also have no time to rest and recuperate. Therefore, the political history of Guizhou over the past 20 years has been marked by the dominance of military force and the extraction of resources from the people by military force, with no trace of true political meaning. What politics is there to speak of?</p>
<p>3.  Military Affairs: In the early years of the Republic of China, the number of troops in Guizhou was extremely small. Since the wars of Protecting the Constitution and Protecting the Nation, Guizhou Province followed the initial uprising, and the number of troops gradually increased, expanding from one division to five brigades. By the 13th and 14th years of the Republic, it had expanded further to seven divisions. They mostly took from their neighbors and provided supplies to other provinces. Therefore, although Guizhou was considered poor, it did not deeply feel the pain of having too many troops. The military power was unified, and there were few phenomena of division and mutual suspicion and prevention. In the 15th year of the Republic, Yuan Zuming led all his troops out of Hunan to participate in the revolution, leaving only one division under Zhou Xicheng to garrison Guizhou. After Yuan's death, the troops outside the province became the 9th, 10th, and 43rd Armies, each working independently and not connected. Zhou Xicheng's troops inside the province also suddenly expanded from one division and were reorganized into the 25th Army. Since then, the Guizhou military system has been completely broken. The troops outside the province were fortunate to be able to rely on the Guizhou people's spirit of endurance and hard work, unafraid of hardship and danger, and worked hard to fight. Although few of them remain today, their merits are firmly recorded in the party and the country. Currently, only a part of the 25th Army in the province is led by Mao Guangxiang, who is in charge of Guizhou. Among those stationed outside the province are Jia Lie's unit (a part of the 25th Army), which is suppressing bandits in the Xiang-Qian border area, Xie Bin's newly formed 10th Division, Li Bohua's Independent 2nd Brigade, Wang Guangzhong's newly formed Independent 18th Brigade, and Luo Qijiang's newly formed Independent 19th Brigade, which are suppressing the Communists in the Hubei area. All the Guizhou troops are here.</p>
<p>4.  Education: Since Guizhou is located in a remote corner and transportation is inconvenient, the education system is naturally behind that of other provinces. Moreover, the education funds are too small to support consolidation. The number of primary and secondary schools that have taken a basic form is extremely limited. Fortunately, many private schools have been established by local sages and pioneers, who have donated funds, and their results are also superior. The provincial schools have been declining due to the instability of the political situation or the failure to provide education funds on time or in the correct amount. The education center is purely built on private groups, which is also a unique phenomenon in Guizhou.</p>
<p>5.  Finance and Government: Guizhou is one of the poorest provinces in China. Before the 6th year of the Republic, the annual income was only three to four million yuan. After the 7th year of the Republic, military affairs gradually expanded, and the military expenses required increased day by day. The government worked hard to increase revenue, and the income increased sharply, with annual tax revenue reaching six to seven million yuan. Since then, financiers have increased tax revenue to ingratiate themselves with the military authorities and to solidify their power and position as their sole purpose, exhausting their abilities. To this day, the annual income has reached seventeen to eighteen million yuan. The productivity of the people today is not stronger than that of the 6th and 7th years of the Republic, but they are burdened with more than five times the amount, so the people's finances are exhausted and it is difficult to sustain them for long. The government's expenditures have never had a budget. Although there is a huge annual income, it is only said that military and political expenses are sometimes insufficient, and the people are relentlessly exploited. The darkness of Guizhou's finances is unique among the provinces.</p>

<p>People from the Four Counties Request Punishment of Bandits: Li Wenjun, the pseudo-chief of staff of Tai Bao A Shu's troops, Zhao Guomin, the pseudo-regimental commander, and He Yinyu and Dai Kechang, the pseudo-battalion commanders, were arrested one after another. They were escorted to the province by provincial order to be interrogated and dealt with by the Security Office. It has been more than a month since then, and there has been no news of their punishment. The Security and Preservation Committee of the four counties of Jin, Song, Jia, and Ping stated that the banditry has been rampant for years, and the number of victims in the four counties is no less than thousands of families. Since the joint suppression by the four counties, the full force of the army and police on land and water has been used, and huge rewards have been offered to capture the ferocious bandits and thieves one by one. The four bandits, Li, Zhao, He, and Dai, have committed numerous crimes, and the evidence is conclusive. Since they were sent to the province, there has been no news. A telegram was sent to Commander Cao, requesting that he forward it to his superiors, requesting that the bandits be publicly executed as soon as possible to appease public opinion. Commander Cao has approved the request and telegraphed it to the Provincial Security Office, requesting that it be forwarded to the Provincial Government for the early execution of the bandits. According to the people of Zhuangjia Hangzhen, Fengxian County, the entire town was burned and killed by the Communist bandits throughout the year, and the bandit leader Li Wenjun belonged to this case. The people of Zhuanghang all have a deep hatred. It is said that they also sent telegrams to the Provincial Peak, requesting that the example of Taibao A Shu be used to execute him on the spot and escort him back to Zhuanghang for execution.</p>
<p>The Tax Police Wireless Team Leaves Songjiang: The wireless communication team of the Special Task Force of the Finance Ministry Tax Police Corps, which was stationed in Songjiang, was previously stationed at the gunpowder depot. Now, it has received a telegram from Director-General Wang, ordering the team leader of the first team, Xie Yongen, to depart immediately. After receiving the order, Xie led the team and left by car at 9:00 AM this morning.</p>

<p>Fire Brigade Member Insulted for No Reason: Since the opening of the Kunshan Public Theater, the manager, Ma Jikang, has repeatedly caused trouble. The Public Security Bureau went to investigate several times, but found nothing and let it go, causing Ma to become even more unscrupulous. At 11:00 PM on the 7th, a Wang family on Xingxue Road suddenly reported carelessness. Zhu Changsheng, a member of the Central Three District Fire Brigade, happened to be taking a nap in front of the theater. Upon hearing the alarm, he blew his police whistle to gather his colleagues and rushed to the rescue. Unexpectedly, he angered Ma, who dragged Zhu into the theater and ordered the patrol officers on the scene to take him to the bureau for handling. Fortunately, the patrol officers were unmoved, and hundreds of spectators persuaded Zhu to leave, believing that Ma was too unreasonable. After the members of the district rescued the fire and returned to the district, they learned of the situation and were greatly dissatisfied. They convened an emergency meeting of all members at 3:00 PM this afternoon (the 8th) and reported the situation to the Joint Association, requesting negotiations with Ma. If there is no satisfactory reply, all members will resign from their duties.</p>

<p>Request to Use Road Construction Funds to Build Dike: The Suzhou County Chamber of Commerce, in view of the severe flooding in the county this summer, which was unseen in 40 years, and witnessing the tragic situation, deeply understands the great relationship between agriculture and commerce. Moreover, most of the land in Suzhou County is rice paddies, which rely on the benefits of the lake water. There are field banks but no dikes, so the entire lake overflows without a way to drain. It takes time for the water to recede, so what remedy can be said? Suzhou County's tax quota is the highest in the country, and the construction fees collected annually are also the highest in the province, but agricultural water conservancy has never been considered. At this critical juncture, there is an urgent need to provide relief. Therefore, it submitted a report to the Provincial Government Construction Department yesterday (the 8th), requesting that the construction of county roads in the county be suspended for one year, and that the road construction funds be used to build low-lying field dikes to provide work relief. It requested that Suzhou County be considered as a financial region, where national expenses are derived, and that a special change be made to protect the disaster victims and ensure agriculture.</p>
<p>Local People Request Changes to Street Widths: More than 20 local people, including Pan Shengnian, Ding Yuqing, and Zhang Zhongren, jointly submitted a report to the Suzhou Provincial Government, the Construction Department, and the Suzhou County Government yesterday (the 8th), stating that the street width in Suzhou City was previously resolved by the Administrative Committee during the era of the Municipal Preparatory Office to be 10 meters as the standard. Later, the Municipal Government repeatedly changed it to 14 meters. Since its implementation, the business districts of Guanqian Street, Jingde Road, and other places have gradually declined. It should be requested that the width of streets that have not yet been widened be based on the previously determined standard for implementation. The files of the former Municipal Preparatory Office should be quickly retrieved, and the county should be ordered to convene a meeting of local people to determine that the widest street should be 10 meters as the standard, and the Construction Bureau should be ordered to comply.</p>
<p>The High Court Transfers Trial Judges: Mo Zongyou, a judge of the Jiangsu High Court, has been ordered to be promoted to prosecutor of the Supreme Court. The vacancy will be filled by Fang Wen, the presiding judge of the Jiangning District Court. In addition, Ji Kuancheng, a trial judge of Gaoyou County, has requested leave, and Jiang Youhua has been appointed to act as his agent.</p>

<p>County Magistrate Seals Off Thunder God Temple: It is a local custom here to celebrate the birthday of the Thunder God on the 23rd day of the sixth month of the lunar calendar every year. The incense is very prosperous, and the city gates in various places are open all night. Vendors are concentrated in Shimei, and their profits are tripled. However, since last year, the county party headquarters resolved to prohibit the opening, so the incense has decreased slightly. Now, the Thunder God's birthday is approaching again, and the party headquarters has again resolved to request the county government to strictly prohibit it. After the county government approved the letter, it ordered the Public Security Bureau to quickly implement it. On the morning of the 6th, Director Yin ordered Officer Cheng of the first branch station to go to Shimei to seal off the Thunder God Temple.</p>
<p>The Notorious Bandit Zheng Ming Was Arrested Again in Shanghai: After the bandit leader Zheng Yushan was arrested in Shanghai by the county government of this county and was found guilty after interrogation and executed by shooting, his son Zheng Ming (who served as a commander in the bandit gang and roamed the northeastern countryside, robbing the Western Yangzhen, etc.) planned to take revenge. Recently, he has been harassing the coastal areas of Wangshi, Fushan, and Bai Mao Kou, claiming to avenge his father, so the coastal residents have been unable to sleep peacefully. Unexpectedly, the Public Security Bureau of this county received a message from Shanghai on the 5th that the notorious bandit Zheng Ming was arrested in Zhabei, Shanghai, by Detective Xu, together with the local security corps, and a Browning pistol was found. He has now been sent to the Xinzha police station for detention. A telegram was immediately sent to Changshu to send police to escort him back. Currently, the Public Security Bureau here sent a team of eight cannon squad members and four detectives to Shanghai on the 6th to escort him back.</p>
<p>After the Power Plant Stopped Supplying Electricity: This power plant was originally scheduled to stop supplying electricity for two weeks from July 9th to replace new machinery. However, almost a month has passed, and it has not been able to restore power. Users have been in darkness every day, and businesses have been greatly affected invisibly. The power plant has not yet made any formal announcement. Therefore, 52 shops in the southern district have jointly requested the users association to convene a meeting to discuss dealing with the plant and urge it to release electricity as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Regulations for Each County to Collect Land Survey Fees: The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs and Department of Finance, regarding the collection of land survey fees in various counties of Jiangsu Province, had previously instructed the Provincial Land Bureau to investigate the situation in each county and revise the plan for phased collection. Subsequently, the bureau responded with suggestions that counties that had completed land surveys should have their collection quotas appropriately reduced and the collection period shortened; counties that had not completed the surveys should have the collection period shortened; and those that had collected fees but not completed the surveys should follow a two-tiered approach: (A) If the collected fees had been completely used, collection should begin in accordance with the general plan, starting from the year of commencement; (B) If the collected fees had been used but a balance remained, the collection quota should be reduced in the final year depending on the amount of the balance. Subsequently, the Department of Civil Affairs and Department of Finance reviewed the circumstances of each county and formulated collection methods accordingly: (1) Kunshan and Baoshan counties, which had completed land surveys, would have their collection reduced by half to five cents per mu, temporarily for one year; (2) Nantong and Rugao counties, which had not completed land surveys, would collect ten cents per mu, temporarily for one year; (3) Chongming and Jiading counties, which had already collected land survey fees, would collect ten cents per mu, temporarily for two years; (4) Nantong and Qidong counties, which needed to commence work early, should begin collecting one year ahead of schedule, starting in the 20th year of the Republic; (5) Shanghai County: due to Article 1, Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the resolution of the provincial and municipal division of administrative power conference regarding land survey, there are already clear regulations. The county is currently requesting a return of funds and has separately requested the Shanghai Municipal Government to consult and handle the matter, with the method to be determined after consultation. The remaining counties will begin collection according to their respective commencement years. After the Land Bureau is established, the situation will be further investigated and handled appropriately.</p>
<p>The Department of Civil Affairs Rectifies Grain Reserves in Each County: In the 18th year of the Republic, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs ordered each county to purchase and store grain with all accumulated funds for grain reserves, without any excuses. However, the storage warehouses in each county were mostly dilapidated, and some funds had been diverted to other uses, making it difficult to find alternative locations. Therefore, although many counties complied with the order to purchase and store grain, they delayed implementation. Diversion and embezzlement were also not uncommon. This year, continuous rain caused disasters, and a good autumn harvest is unlikely. Rectifying grain reserves and providing disaster relief are now extremely urgent. Director Hu has specially drafted nine standard measures for replenishing warehouses in each county and recovering embezzled funds, and has appointed Jiang Fuqin to Wuxian, Changshu, Kunshan, Wuxi, Wujin, and Jiangyin; Wu Xie to Songjiang, Nanhui, Qingpu, Fengxian, Jinshan, and Taicang; Yu Shoufan to Jiading, Chongming, Haimen, Jurong, and Danyang; and Shi Zhizhi to Nantong, Rugao, Xinghua, Taixian, and Gaoyou to supervise the county magistrates in their earnest implementation. The remaining 39 counties, including Zhenjiang and Jiangdu, are strictly ordered to be responsible for the implementation.</p>
<p>The Section Affairs Dispute in the 17th District Remains Unresolved: The entire township head of the 17th district of the county, Zheng Shaohong, and 37 others, disagreed with the section chief Hua Sigǔ. They jointly submitted their resignations to the county government. County Magistrate Chen summoned section chief Hua Sigǔ and township head Zheng Shaohong to the county on the 27th of last month for a personal inquiry. Since the issues raised were all minor, he ordered them to prioritize the local area, work together harmoniously, be open and honest, and seek happiness for the people. The previous issues were not to be discussed. The township heads all agreed and withdrew. After returning to their townships, they felt that the county government's handling was not thorough. Yesterday, they held an emergency meeting, chaired by Xi Wenxuan, and resolved that until section chief Hua Sigǔ was removed, section affairs would be temporarily maintained by the joint office of township heads.</p>
<p>Daughters-in-Law Disagree, One Hangs Herself: Pu A Jin, a villager from Lane 381, Lao Pu Lane, 11th District (South Yanshi), was 24 years old and married to Cai, who was 20 years old. Pu had four brothers, all working as assistants in Shanghai's Changsan brothels. After A Jin married in the 18th year of the Republic, the couple's relationship was initially harmonious. However, due to the stirring up of trouble by his sisters-in-law, the relationship gradually deteriorated, leading to discord between the daughters-in-law and frequent arguments. A Jin repeatedly beat Cai. Cai told her mother's family, who were unable to intervene, and could only sigh in despair. Cai, filled with resentment, developed a desire to end her life. On the morning of the 7th, at around 7:00 AM, she changed into new clothes and shoes in her room, took a hemp rope, hung it from the beam, and hanged herself. It is said that Cai was seven months pregnant, resulting in two deaths. Neighbors lamented the tragedy.</p>

His son, Xiang Jin, was currently 10 years old. His wife had passed away. Lu, unaccustomed to sleeping alone, was introduced by a colleague to a woman surnamed Li from Qishuyan to be his second wife. After she entered the family, the couple's love was extremely strong, but they did not have any children. Instead, she often abused his son. The day before, she forced Xiang Jin to wash his pants at Qing Ting Bang. He accidentally fell into the river and drowned. Afterwards, Lu returned home from the shop and learned of the incident. He rushed to retrieve the body. It took about an hour to recover Xiang Jin's body. It was a tragic scene.</p>

<p>Many Died in the Wanfu Bridge Ferry Accident: The Construction Bureau suggested that due to the collapse of both the Wanfu Bridge and the Dongshi Bridge in Dongxiang, merchants should be recruited to undertake ferry services. It is now learned that the ferry service has not yet been contracted, and the original ferryboat suddenly encountered danger on the 7th at around 11:00 AM while sailing from Wanfu Bridge to Xian, due to the rapid tide and currents. More than 40 passengers were drowned, and their bodies drifted away with the waves, making it impossible to retrieve them.</p>
<p>After the Dam Was Opened, the Floodwater in Jiangdu Settled: The water level in the Grand Canal dropped by five inches on the 6th. The water level in the Jiangdu Fan San Gou Sluice Gate was two zhang three chi six cun. There was no rise on the 7th. The water discharge is underway, and there has been no retreat. On the 5th, the telegram stated that the water level at Yumatou was one zhang nine chi one cun. The provincial government has dispatched Qian Jia, the section chief of the Third Division, to reside in Gaoyou. He returned to the province from Yangzhou on the 7th to report. However, in the northern townships of Chi'an Lake, Gongdao Bridge, Songjia Bridge, Yangshou Dam, and Fangjia Lane, the embankments had previously been flooded due to the rise of the lake, submerging tens of thousands of acres of embanked fields. Four to five thousand residents, totaling 40,000 people, were all engulfed in water. Now that the dam has been opened and the water has receded, the houses are gone. In addition to the floating corpses of humans and livestock, the survivors are displaced and must still engage in the work of retrieving and burying the floating corpses. The situation is extremely tragic. Representatives have been sent out in all directions for relief. West of Shaobo, the wind is tight, and in addition to opening the five dams leading to the sea, it is no longer possible to open the central dam of Gaoyou and the Zhaoguan dam of Jiangdu. There is still concern that "when the west wind arrives, the riverbanks will collapse."</p>
<p>Discussion on the Plan to Protect the Shaobo Embankment from Danger: County Magistrate Chen Nanxuan, following the provincial government's telegram order that the embankment along the canal should be protected by the director in conjunction with the county magistrates, specially sent Section Chief Lu Shiquan to Shaobo to meet with Shao Fuchen, the director of the Jiangdu section of the Canal Works Office, to convene a meeting of various institutions and organizations in the town to discuss defense projects. The following emergency measures were agreed upon: (1) The director of the Shaobo office will be responsible for ordering the Jiangdu Fan to increase personnel stationed at the worksite every night. (2) Two thousand shi of firewood must be rushed, along with hemp bags, rush bags, and ropes, to Shaobo in preparation for emergency repairs. (3) The use of farmland for soil extraction should be started first, and after the project is completed, the district office, together with the works office, will evaluate the value and submit it to the province for distribution. It is reported that the people of Shaobo have already formed a defense team. The method is that the town criers will announce to the villagers that each household should send one able-bodied man with a lantern to gather at Tieniu Bay at night, with a total of about 500 people, to carry out patrol duties to prevent the embankment from collapsing and causing danger.</p>

<p>Rice Industry Price Limit Not to Exceed 17 Yuan</p>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau Orders to Prohibit Hoarding: Seeing that rice prices have been rising continuously in recent days, which is not entirely due to the relationship between supply and demand, the Social Affairs Bureau has issued separate orders to the guild associations of the bean and rice industries, etc.: In order to comply with orders, it is found that rice prices have been rising due to water obstacles in shipping routes, and Ding geng has reached 18 yuan. It is important to know that geng rice had a bumper harvest last autumn, and the production area has rich reserves this year, which are enough to use when the season is running out, although disaster relief rice is needed in various places. However, it is limited to Xianyang rice. Geng rice is still in the midst of a ban on exports. Why do you raise the price so high to hinder the people's food supply? Therefore, this order is issued to the guild association, and you are to quickly notify your peers that there must be no more hoarding or manipulating of prices, resulting in disaster. This order, etc.</p>
<p>Bean and Rice Industry Discussed Price Limit: The guild associations of the bean and rice industries in this city recently received an order from the Social Affairs Bureau to order their peers not to take the opportunity to raise grain prices, etc. Therefore, yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, a general meeting of all peers was convened in Cuixiu Hall to discuss the instructions from the Social Affairs Bureau. Everyone believed that the continuous rain this time, the scarcity of sources, and the soaring rice prices were all due to the times, but in order to maintain the people's food supply, the highest white keng rice should not exceed 17 yuan per stone, and the middle and second grades should be priced separately. It is reported that the industry has been notified to comply and has reported to the Social Affairs Bureau for filing.</p>

<p>The Social Affairs Bureau Ordered Resumption of Operations Yesterday</p>
<p>Board of Directors Resolved to Resume Work Tomorrow</p>
<p>Because the Publishing Industry Workers' Union held a general meeting to establish a branch office of the union at the Chung Hwa Book Company's branch office at 4 PM the day before yesterday (the 7th), which was deemed an illegal action, the Chung Hwa Book Company urgently telegraphed that evening to temporarily suspend operations starting yesterday, pending an on-site inspection by the authorities. The Publishing Industry Workers' Union considered this an act of suppressing the labor movement and requested a severe punishment. The Social Affairs Bureau strictly ordered the cessation of the suspension of operations. The Chung Hwa Book Company held a board meeting last night to discuss solutions. The details of the situation are recorded below:</p>
<p>Telegram Announcing Suspension of Operations: Chung Hwa Book Company urgently telegraphed a temporary suspension of operations, stating: To the Nanjing Central Political Conference, Central Party Headquarters, National Government, Executive Yuan, Ministry of Industry, Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters, Mayor, Social Affairs Bureau, Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and Book Industry Guild: At 3 PM on the afternoon of the 6th of this month, the Shanghai Publishing Industry Workers' Union sent a letter stating that a branch office of the Publishing Industry Workers' Union would be established at the Chung Hwa Book Company at 4 PM on the afternoon of the 7th, requesting to end work one and a half hours early. We immediately replied, stating that the letter did not specify which department, and requested clear instructions to submit to the board of directors, etc., and reported it to the Municipal Party Headquarters and Social Affairs Bureau for record. Unexpectedly, at 3 PM on the afternoon of the 7th, fifty to sixty people suddenly broke into the workshops, monitoring the workers' actions, locking the front and back doors, and prohibiting entry and exit. At 4 PM, someone who identified himself as Zhu Yuansong, claiming to have been sent by Mr. Wang Wenhua, rang the work stoppage bell without authorization, forcing workers to attend the meeting. At the same time, many people went to the general office and editorial department, forcibly locking the doors and expelling the editors and office workers to the open space. Staff and workers could not go out or enter the workshops. In the evening, there was almost a conflict before the doors were opened and the meeting was dismissed. It was found that the unauthorized ringing of the work stoppage bell at 4 PM was sudden, interrupting work, and the disturbance by many people caused disorder. Xin Cheng, Xie Tai, Xi San, and others were present and were at a loss. Many employees visited at night, saying that in this situation, human rights were not guaranteed, and freedom was being deprived, requesting the company to find a solution, otherwise everyone would be in danger. Article 20 of the Trade Union Law stipulates that trade unions shall not force workers to join, and Article 27 stipulates that trade union officials or members shall not close shops or factories. The union's actions are so illegal that the company's property and business, and the employees' lives and freedom, have lost their protection. As a last resort, operations will be temporarily suspended tomorrow, and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and Municipal Chamber of Commerce will be requested to send personnel for on-site inspection to seek administrative and legal remedies. Urgent words, hoping for consideration. Respectfully, Lu Fei Kui, General Manager of Chung Hwa Book Company Limited, Shu Xincheng, Director of the Editorial Department, Chen Xietai, Director of the Printing Department, and Lu Xisan, Director of the General Office.</p>
<p>Union Notice: The Municipal Publishing Industry Workers' Union urgently notified all members, stating: The Chung Hwa Book Company office of this union held a general meeting of members at 4 PM yesterday. Representatives from the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Municipal Government Social Affairs Bureau attended to provide guidance. The legal procedures were extremely complete. However, the management of the company is cunning and rogue, making false statements to create alarm, and has arbitrarily suspended operations, resorting to the old tricks of suppressing the labor movement from 1927, in order to intimidate workers. Their intention is nothing more than to undermine the union organization. In addition to submitting a request to the Municipal Government Social Affairs Bureau for strict sanctions, the city has also sent a letter directly to the management, urging them to realize their mistake and resume work immediately. All wages during the suspension period should be paid in full by the management. All members, please rest assured and strengthen unity. The union will fulfill its responsibility to fully protect you. This is announced.</p>
<p>Ministry of Industry's Telegram Inquiry: The main factory, branch printing factory, general office, and editorial department of Chung Hwa Book Company on Jing'an Temple Road implemented a suspension of operations starting yesterday. More than a thousand employees were out of work. Yesterday afternoon, a telegram was received from the Ministry of Industry, stating: Chung Hwa Book Company, your telegram is noted. The Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has been telegraphed to investigate and handle it properly according to law. Special reply, Ministry of Industry.</p>
<p>Management Petition: Yesterday morning, Lu Fei Bohong, General Manager of Chung Hwa Book Company, and Shu Xincheng, Director of the Translation Department, personally went to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to report the suspension of operations and requested that personnel be sent for on-site inspection. Director Pan Gongzhan received them and accepted the request. At the same time, Lu Xisan and Chen Xietai were sent to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to request that personnel be sent for investigation. Committee members Ye Huijun and Lu Fengzhu received them and accepted the request. In the afternoon, the Social Affairs Bureau sent Zhu Jintao to investigate thoroughly for review. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent Ye Huijun and Lu Fengzhu to investigate for submission.</p>
<p>Social Affairs Bureau Order: The Social Affairs Bureau yesterday ordered Chung Hwa Book Company to continue normal operations, stating: An order to comply. According to advertisements in today's local newspapers, if the trade union has illegal actions, it should be reported to this bureau for investigation. Arbitrarily suspending operations affects the livelihood of all employees, which is inappropriate. You are hereby ordered to comply and must resume normal operations tomorrow and await this bureau's review. Do not delay. This order is imperative.</p>
<p>Board Meeting: Chung Hwa Book Company held a board meeting at the general distribution office on Simar Road at 3 PM yesterday. All directors, including Lu Fei Bohong, and senior officials, such as Shu Xincheng, Director of the Editorial Department, Chen Xietai, Director of the Printing Department, Wang Jinshi, Deputy Director, and Lu Xisan, Director of the General Office, were present. It was decided on the spot that work would resume on Monday in compliance with the order, and the authorities would be awaited to review. An advertisement would be placed in newspapers immediately to announce this.</p>
<p>Book Industry Meeting: The Book Industry Guild held an emergency meeting at 5 PM yesterday. More than twenty people, including Lu Fei Bohong, attended to discuss the Chung Hwa Book Company suspension case. A telegram was sent, stating: To Commander-in-Chief Jiang in Nanchang, the Central Party Headquarters in Nanjing, the Central Political Conference, the Executive Yuan of the National Government, and the Ministry of Industry: According to the telegram report from member Chung Hwa Book Company (details omitted from the previous text), after the guild investigated and verified, the sudden stoppage of power in the Chung Hwa Book Company factory caused significant losses. Moreover, the Publishing Industry Workers' Union disregarded the provisional law, criminal law, and trade union law, trampled on human rights, undermined industry, and did not adhere to the scope of its mission. If this trend continues, government laws will be treated as trash, and the future of industry and commerce will be unthinkable. We request a thorough investigation and punishment to fulfill the last wishes of the late Premier to revitalize industry and save the country. Before this matter is resolved according to law, the Book Industry Guild of Shanghai will not recognize any actions taken by the Publishing Industry Workers' Union towards other bookstores. Respectfully, Shanghai Book Industry Guild.</p>
<p>Union Condolences: The Publishing Industry Workers' Union has reportedly scheduled a general meeting of representatives from various unions to discuss countermeasures. The Water and Electricity Industry Union and other unions visited the union yesterday to express their condolences and offered to serve as a backing.</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Statement: The Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Industry and the municipal party and government agencies yesterday regarding the Chung Hwa Book Company's suspension of operations, stating: Chung Hwa Book Company did not reject the Publishing Industry Workers' Union's request to end work one and a half hours early. If the time was too short, the union could have sent representatives to contact the responsible personnel of the company after receiving the company's reply, either to end work early for all or for a part. All have its proper procedure to follow. If the company did not accept, the union should have appealed to the party and government agencies according to law for sanctions. However, the union did not consider these measures and led many people to act violently. Locking the front and back doors, prohibiting entry and exit, directly blockaded the factory, violating the prohibition in Article 27, Paragraph 1, of the Trade Union Law. The unauthorized ringing of the work stoppage bell and forcing workers to attend the meeting was done without prior solicitation of membership and intended to force all workers of the company to join the union, violating the prohibition in Article 20 of the Trade Union Law. To achieve harmonious labor-management relations, it is necessary to strictly adhere to national laws and regulations and to understand each other in case of incidents. If they rely on their numbers and strength to act outside the bounds of law, then boundaries will be difficult to eliminate, industry will be difficult to develop, and it will only open the door to instigation by treacherous people, which is a hidden worry for the future of the country and social order. It is appropriate to report the situation to your ministry and bureau for review and to grant sanctions according to law so that the company can receive the legal protection it deserves, which is in the public interest. Respectfully, Shanghai Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Union Letter: The Publishing Industry Workers' Union sent a letter to the General Manager of Chung Hwa Book Company yesterday, stating: Dear Mr. Bohong, Upon reading the front-page advertisement in various newspapers, the content of your company's urgent telegram is absurd. Its false statements and alarmist rhetoric clearly intend to undermine workers joining the union. It is regrettable that a leading cultural institution in the country disregards law and reason and resorts to such a low tactic. According to the meeting procedure, the Municipal Party Headquarters and Social Affairs Bureau sent official representatives to guide the meeting on site and witnessed the actual situation. The Political Department of the Public Concession also sent investigator Li Haifeng to maintain order. However, your company groundlessly claims that the property, business, employees' lives, and freedom have lost their protection. Your company cannot hide the truth from the world. The union does not wish to argue further on this point. However, the union disapproves of your company's old tricks of suspending operations for three months in 1927 to suppress the labor movement. The union has always maintained consistent labor-management relations and cannot refrain from offering the following sincere advice. We hope that your company can have a full understanding and resume operations as usual. In the future, we can discuss the welfare of both parties in the long term. Otherwise, if this causes more serious disputes, your company should bear full responsibility.</p>
<p>Union Defense: The Publishing Industry Workers' Union submitted a report to the Social Affairs Bureau and the Municipal Party Headquarters yesterday, stating: Requesting an order for Chung Hwa Book Company to resume operations immediately to promote the labor movement and maintain industry. The members of the Chung Hwa Book Company requested to convene a general meeting of the Shanghai Publishing Industry Workers' Union Chung Hwa Book Company branch office at the Chung Hwa Book Company's main factory at 4 PM on August 7, which has been reported to your bureau for review and approval, and representatives were sent to provide guidance. Unexpectedly, Lu Fei Kui, General Manager of the company, Shu Xincheng, Director of the Translation Department, Chen Xietai, Director of the Printing Department, and Lu Xisan, Director of the General Office, advertised the company's urgent telegram in the local newspapers on August 8 (details omitted). According to the investigation, the meeting was convened at 4 PM on August 7, and the general manager of the company was officially notified in advance. During the meeting, representatives Gu Bingyuan from your bureau and Wu Jiazhe from the Municipal Party Headquarters provided guidance. All procedures were handled in accordance with the initial steps of civil rights. However, the company's management dared to fabricate facts and falsely claim that the union forced workers to join and blockaded the company's factory. Ask if there was such behavior that day. The representatives from your bureau will have a report to prove, and the union does not need to defend itself. The company's management arbitrarily suspended operations, used its old tricks, suppressed the labor movement, and opposed the members of the union. The facts are clear and cannot be denied. We respectfully request that the company be ordered to resume operations immediately and publish a correction of the false information in the telegram to promote the labor movement and maintain industry, which is in the public interest.</p>
<p>Management Submission: Chung Hwa Book Company submitted a document to the Social Affairs Bureau, stating: To request the distinction between the nature of trade unions to comply with. On August 6, at 3 PM, a letter was received from the Shanghai Publishing Workers' Union, stating (details omitted). According to Article 2 of the Trade Union Law, a union organized by workers of different occupations within the same enterprise is an industrial union, and a union organized by workers of the same occupation is a professional union. In the past, the company had an internal industrial Chung Hwa Book Company Union, and there were external professional bookbinding unions, color printing unions, ink lithography unions, and lead printing unions. The store clerks are also members of the Bookstore Guild, Color Printing Industry Guild, and Instrument and Stationery Guild. Now there is an industrial and professional Publishing Industry Union, leaving the company and workers at a loss as to what to do. If the Trade Union Law and its implementing regulations are studied carefully, the Chung Hwa Book Company, except for the staff and clerks' union organized four years ago, which has been legally canceled, the Chung Hwa Book Company Printing Factory Union is an industrial union, and the bookbinding union, etc., are professional unions. Choose one of the two to retain and strictly prohibit double union membership to avoid diverging methods and conflicting orders. This would benefit both commercial and labor movements and comply with the provisions of the Trade Union Law. We respectfully request instructions on how to proceed.</p>

<p>Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting went to the Song residence on Seymour Road at 9 AM yesterday to pay respects to the late Madam Song. At 12 PM, he went to the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to meet the newly appointed Ambassador to Japan, Jiang Zuobin, and discussed the diplomatic policy towards Japan in detail for about forty minutes. After Jiang left, he told reporters that his assumption of office in Japan has not been decided yet. He is currently preparing everything, but due to the short time, it is unlikely to happen in the middle of next week. Foreign Minister Wang is scheduled to go to Hangzhou today and return to Beijing by train on Monday evening. It was also reported that Foreign Minister Wang met with Mayor Zhang Qun at the Foreign Affairs Office at about 4 PM yesterday to discuss certain important matters, which lasted about an hour, and an appropriate solution has been agreed upon. Subsequently, he successively met with Czech Chargé d'Affaires Feizer and Polish Chargé d'Affaires Weidengtao. Wang returned home to rest at 5:30 PM.

<p>Shanghai Mayor Zhang received a telegram from Vice Minister Ge of the General Staff Department from Peiping yesterday, stating: To Mayor Zhang, Yue Junxun's鑒 (for your viewing), confidential, Shi Yousan's rebels were said to have 60,000 to 70,000 troops, but the report from the deputy minister's verification is that there were actually about 30,000 rifles, more than 20 large and small cannons, and mortars of various sizes. Since the rebellion, part of its artillery was confiscated by Yu Xiaohou in Dingzhou, and the rest was confiscated by Gu Mosan and Chen Wuming in Shulu. All rifles, after five days and nights of fierce fighting on the battlefield, about 5,000 were abandoned. No less than 2,000 rifles were confiscated in various cities along the Pinghan Railway, such as Shunde, Neiqiu, and Handan. Also, Shen Ke's troops, about 7,000 to 8,000, have been surrounded by the Northern Route Army near Tangxian and Quyang and are negotiating surrender. As for the core cadres, Sun Guangqian and Mi Wenhe, they have been captured in Shulu, so nearly 20,000 rifles have been confiscated. Shi Yousan himself only led the remnants of the pistol team to escape to Jixian County. The various armies are cooperating to pursue him, and it is expected that he will not escape justice. In summary, according to military reports collected from all parties, as of now, the rebel army's weapons have been confiscated, and its strength has been completely eliminated. There is no danger of it wandering elsewhere. The rebel army, which has been repeatedly harming the country for three years, has now been completely eliminated, which is a blessing for the party and the country and enough to comfort the people of the country.

<p>Detained Aircraft Parts Can Be Resolved Soon</p>
<p>Chen Jiliang Is Scheduled to Go to Fujian Tomorrow</p>
<p>Du Xigui Is Suffering from Severe Diarrhea</p>
<p>Naval Vice Minister Chen Shaokuan arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. A reporter from the East China News Agency interviewed him at the Jiangnan Shipyard yesterday. According to him:</p>
<p>Detained Aircraft Parts: Regarding the customs detention of aircraft parts, I believe there is no major issue. Although the parts shipped from abroad by the Jiangnan Shipyard have passports, they are often delayed by the Jianghai Customs for a period of time before they can be picked up. Therefore, the aircraft parts are no exception. It can be resolved in about one or two days. In the past, when purchasing imported parts, if the customs mistakenly believed that taxes were required, the ministry could only pay first as a guarantee, and then the tax would be refunded after the customs verified that they were tax-exempt items. The funds required by the ministry are allocated by the Ministry of Finance, so paying taxes is just a more cumbersome procedure.</p>
<p>Chen's Trip to Fujian: Commander Chen Jiliang of the First Fleet is scheduled to go to Fujian next Monday. All personnel of the department have moved to the Hai Rong warship. The headquarters of the first team will be stationed on the ship. The Hai Chou and other eight ships will sail to the exercises at the same time.</p>
<p>Du Is Sick: General Du Xigui, the newly appointed president of the Mawei Naval Academy, was originally scheduled to go to Fujian next month to take office, but he suddenly felt the heat due to the hot weather the day before yesterday and is now suffering from severe diarrhea. General Du is old and physically weak. He is now being treated by a Western doctor. I visited him personally yesterday.</p>
<p>Li Shijia Returns: As for Li Shijia, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Navy, who was ordered to go to Japan to inspect students and inspect the Ninghai ship project, has completed his mission and is scheduled to return to China next week. Due to financial difficulties, it is feared that this year's graduates from the Naval Aviation Department will not be able to study abroad.</p>

We humbly request that you send commissioners as soon as possible, carrying funds to help, so that overseas Chinese can still be attached to their motherland, and the foreign thugs can also cease their ferocity.

<h3 id="e106">Anti-Japanese Association Warns Unscrupulous Merchants <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Severe Sanctions Will Be Imposed If Smuggling Continues</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Urges Chinese Yarn Merchants Not to Raise Prices Opportunistically</p>
<p>According to the New Voice Society, since the incident of Korean people discriminating against Chinese people, the Chinese people seem to have awakened somewhat. The work of the Anti-Japanese Aid-to-Overseas-Chinese Committee is also not as it used to be. However, some unscrupulous merchants are still smuggling Japanese goods and taking the opportunity to raise prices. The following is a record of the committee's warning to various merchants and the meeting of the Custody Section yesterday.</p>
<p>Warning Against Smuggling: Yesterday, the association sent letters of warning to customs brokers such as Sin Chong Loong, Sin Chong Guan, Jardine Yü, Taikoo Fai, Fu Wo, Da Chuan Tong, Fai Kee, and Yat Sang Yü, as well as Hong Da Cheung and Yu Hong Cheung, two stores dealing in foreign seafood. The letter stated: "It has been verified that your company is smuggling Japanese goods in an attempt to profit from them. During this incident where Japanese people cruelly murdered overseas Chinese, all those with blood and spirit deeply hate this. All circles in the city of Yu initiated a fervent movement of economic severance with Japan, vowing to fight to the death with a spirit of non-cooperation. Yet your company dares to defy public opinion and smuggle Japanese goods, not only willingly acting as the ringleader in destroying the anti-Japanese movement, but also making yourselves public enemies of the entire nation. This has been decided upon after deliberation by the Sixth Standing Committee Meeting of this association, and a severe warning is hereby issued. If it is discovered that you are outwardly compliant but inwardly resistant, then public opinion will naturally impose severe sanctions. We hope you will think twice."</p>
<p>Prohibition of Price Hikes for Chinese Yarn: The City Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Chinese Yarn Factory Association, stating: "On the 7th of this month, we received a letter from the Jiangyin County Chamber of Commerce stating, 'Our county's textile industry has always relied on Japanese yarn factories in Shanghai for raw materials. During this boycott movement, if there is no solution for the aforementioned cotton yarn, there is concern that the domestic dyeing and weaving industry will face unemployment. However, Chinese yarn factories in Shanghai are taking advantage of the opportunity to drastically increase the price by 30 to 40 taels per piece. We believe that when the Chinese people are subjected to the humiliation and oppression of Japanese imperialism, the entire nation is united, bearing sorrow and pain, and embracing great sacrifices to carry out the boycott movement. Yet, Chinese yarn factories are taking advantage of the opportunity to profit, raising yarn prices, which is no different from destroying the boycott movement, causing the dyeing and weaving industry to suffer. Considering the matter logically, how can this be considered fair? We are writing to request that you forward this to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce Anti-Japanese Aid-to-Overseas-Chinese Committee to stop Chinese yarn factories from taking the opportunity to raise prices, and to sell all brands of cotton yarn at the prices before the boycott movement. Chinese yarn factories should be able to clarify their intentions. We are very eager for this outcome.' We approve of this. The boycott movement should be nationwide. However, the Chinese yarn factories are taking advantage of the opportunity to raise yarn prices, which is greatly detrimental to domestic industry. We approve of the reasons in the letter. In addition to forwarding this, we are writing to inform you and hope that you will investigate and correct this promptly to rectify the city's atmosphere and maintain the industry." The letter arrived at the association. The letter also said that, "This economic severance with Japan is an opportunity for Chinese yarn to sell well. Even if you consider the business itself, selling at the same price as before the boycott, the profits are already considerable. If you take the opportunity to raise prices again, the dyeing and weaving industries everywhere will suffer greatly. It's not a method that takes public welfare into consideration. We are writing to request that your association earnestly advise the yarn factories among your members to sell at the same price as before the boycott, in order to maintain the weaving industry (in the spirit of public friendship)."</p>
<p>Meeting of the Custody Section: The Custody Section of the association held its second section meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday in the meeting room. Zhang Yichen, Wang Yansong (represented by Tian Siwei), Zhou Ganling, Dong Jianfeng, Fan Chuchen, Zhang Xiankang, Fu Yaoqing, Gu Shanzhang, Sun Sijiu, and Tian Siwei attended. Zhang Yichen chaired and Gu Shanzhang recorded. The meeting opened with formalities. After the chairman and various secretaries reported, the discussion began: (1) Regarding the proposal to rent another warehouse in the Nanshi area to store additional items and facilitate storage, the resolution was passed. (2) Regarding Gu Shanzhang's request to the secretariat to send a letter to the Public Security Bureau to increase patrols in the cargo depots in various districts and to dispatch police assistance when necessary, the resolution was passed. (3) Regarding Zhou Ganling's proposal that the section should rent a large warehouse in a convenient location for transportation as a general cargo depot for storing large batches of whole pieces of goods, the resolution was passed. (4) Regarding the re-establishment of the date for the section meeting, the resolution was passed for every Sunday afternoon at 3:00 PM. Other matters were briefly discussed.</p>
<p>Assault Has Been Compensated: On July 27th, Zhong Jinghan and Cai Peiyuan, employees of Shen Da Transportation Company, were arrested by the Public Security Bureau and sent to the Shanghai District Court for investigation for assaulting inspectors of the Anti-Japanese Association. It is now learned that the prosecutor of the court has persuaded the victims to request the withdrawal of the original case. As for Zhong Jinghan and Cai Peiyuan, because they were apprehended for committing assault, they voluntarily compensated for medical expenses and apologized in person. It is said that the Anti-Japanese Association has informally indicated that it will not pursue the matter deeply because the perpetrators have admitted their mistake, apologized, and compensated for the losses. This matter may come to an end here.</p>
<p>Insult Has Been Apologized For: Xin Tai Chang Trading Company of the Sixteenth Section of Nanshi was detained by the Nanshi Inspection Office of the Inspection Section of the Shanghai Anti-Japanese Aid-to-Overseas-Chinese Association because it transported five hemp sacks. After the association verified that the hemp sacks were not Japanese goods, the Standing Committee decided to release them. While the office was following the procedures to order the Nanshi Inspection Office to release the goods, Ying Dingsheng, a partner of the trading company, rushed to the Inspection Section of the Anti-Japanese Association, making trouble unreasonably, being imposing, speaking rudely, and cursing wildly. The incident was heard by all the staff of the association and caused great indignation. Everyone believed that Ying Dingsheng's public insult should be punished appropriately as a warning. Lin Yuanqing and others from the trading company repeatedly pleaded on his behalf, forgiving his first offense and exempting him from prosecution. It is said that the association, as an organization of patriotic movement, has been making every effort to protect domestic goods. If there are any suspicious goods, they will be temporarily detained. Once it is verified that they are domestic goods, they will be returned immediately. Ying Dingsheng knew that he was in the wrong for his rude words and immediately apologized to the staff of the Anti-Japanese Association. Xin Tai Chang Trading Company will also publish an apology in the newspaper.</p>

<h3 id="e108">The Food Situation Amid the Flood <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>There Are No Major Concerns This Year</p>
<p>Preparation Should Be Made Urgently for the Future</p>
<p>Recently, various rice-producing areas have reported floods and damage to crops, causing public anxiety and a gradual increase in rice prices. A reporter from the Wuchen Society visited Mr. Feng Liutang, Chairman of the Food Committee of the Social Affairs Bureau, yesterday to inquire about the food situation in the future. Mr. Feng provided a general overview, stating,</p>
<p>The Food Supply of This City: Has always relied on transportation from various regions. Those coming from north of Shanghai mainly come from Changshu, Wuxi, Chengqing. Those arriving from south of Shanghai mostly come from the Songjiang and Wuxian areas. Since last year's bumper harvest, the storage of factories in Wuxi and other places is still abundant, with signs of surplus. Even landlords and rural farmers in the interior, aware of the high rice prices in the past two years, and those who are capable, are thinking of selling when the price is right. Therefore, the current rice reserves should be sufficient to meet the current needs, so it seems that there should be no problems. Moreover, new japonica rice from Pudong has been on the market for four or five days. Although the quantity is limited, the arrival of new rice should slightly weaken psychological factors. After this month, Dongxin rice will be in full bloom, and the arrival of Xixin rice is not far away.</p>
<p>The Key for the Future: Lies in whether the weather can be sunny and rainy in moderation, and without hurricanes. The disaster of this flood was particularly light in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The fields along the lake and swamps are certainly hopeless. However, it is difficult to have three or four years of harvest for this type of field rice in ten years. However, due to the excessive amount of water this year, Lu Xian rice will inevitably suffer the same damage. However, if the weather is favorable, the major fields of rice can still have a harvest of 50 to 60%, which depends on fate and is not controlled by human power.</p>
<p>Disasters in Various Regions: According to reports, all rice-producing areas have suffered from major floods, especially the Hunan and Anhui provinces, which are most closely related to the people's food. Anhui rice (commonly known as Ke Xian) is concentrated in Wuhu and can be transshipped to various provinces. Therefore, the damage to Anhui rice has the same impact on the food of various provinces. This time, most of the rice-producing areas in Anhui Province were flooded, and the poor harvest is expected. In previous years, when the grain supply was insufficient between the old and new harvests, Anhui rice, which came out earlier, could be used to adjust the situation. It is difficult to predict whether there will be such hope this year. Hunan and Hubei provinces have always been famous for producing rice. There is a saying that "If Hunan and Hubei are ripe, the world is sufficient. If Wujiang is ripe, there is only a bowl of porridge." However, the floods in Hunan and Hubei are unusually severe. According to recent news, if the weather in Hunan Province clears up and the water recedes quickly, there may still be 40 to 50% of harvest. Recently, there has been an order prohibiting rice from leaving the province. The harvest of Li rice is affected by bandits and communists, so it cannot be fully guaranteed. During the early Qing Dynasty, Sichuan Province often transported grain to supply the provinces in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. In recent years, there have been imports of foreign rice, and grain production has decreased, which can be seen from this. However, since various places have suffered from floods and the fields and houses have been damaged, even if there is any remedy,</p>
<p>Famine in the Future: Is already unavoidable. What is important now is urgent relief, and we should also pay attention to the future food supply, otherwise, a panic like that of 1930 will occur again, or even worse. Competing to purchase foreign rice will only increase the leakage of resources. However, according to China's current situation, it is necessary to drink poison to quench thirst, that is, to adopt the method of purchasing foreign rice. However, there should also be a way to purchase foreign rice. For example, this time, the price of foreign rice has been reported to be rising. It is said that a certain foreign firm added to the flood and insect disasters in China, and immediately telegraphed to Siam and Annam, where rice is produced, to order tens of thousands of tons. The market price has soared. Chinese merchants do not have direct dealings with foreign countries and are at their mercy. In the future, if various provinces are in famine, and compete to purchase foreign rice, it will give people the opportunity to manipulate and hoard, and we will only suffer unnecessary losses. Therefore, even if we want to purchase foreign rice in the future, it is best to be prepared, be able to communicate with each other, and not raise grain prices due to sudden supply and demand relations. To be able to absorb foreign rice from a more profitable way, then the reduction of this loss is also considerable, which depends on the cooperation of the provinces and cities and the merchants who purchase foreign rice, or it can be realized. Currently,</p>
<p>The Most Important Work: Is to understand how severe the disaster is in various rice-producing areas, which is closely related to the relief of the famine in the future. If the percentage of the disaster and the approximate amount of the autumn harvest can be accurately investigated by the disaster relief personnel in various places this time, then after this change, the county governments of each place will supervise the villages and townships to investigate and report at any time until the autumn harvest is completed. This percentage and approximate amount must be as close to the actual situation as possible. Report to the Ministry of Interior and announce it to various places. In order to cope with this famine, a united agency should be established by the producing and selling provinces and cities to make overall plans and cooperate, so that the purchase and distribution of food can have a basis and not be blindly moved, and its benefits will be even greater. However, in the past, provinces and cities often</p>
<p>Prohibited Transportation and Curtailed Purchase: This method can be maintained for a while, but if everyone follows suit, the circulation of food will lose its freedom, and there will inevitably be those who suffer from it. Therefore, mutual circulation is still appropriate. If one place prohibits transportation out of the country, and it is unknown whether it can be self-sufficient after the prohibition, if another place is short of food, it will retaliate in the same way. The danger is great. Moreover, if it is possible to export high-priced rice and buy cheap rice, it will benefit the food economy of the area. Why must we be in the same country, with borders like the states of Qin and Yue looking at each other? We must know that the food problem is a whole, and it can only be solved through cooperation. Dealing with it piecemeal will not help. As for the future price of rice, it may be influenced by the rush to purchase relief rice in various places, and the public's heart will be strong and prices will gradually rise. It is also possible. However, japonica rice is prohibited from leaving the country and has a large amount of reserves, so there should not be as drastic a situation as last year. Xian rice will inevitably be taken high, and it is inevitable. The Social Affairs Bureau is paying attention to the food supply at any time. Since the registration of foreign rice, the import and export of rice in this city has become clearer. Even with the increase in rice prices, although it contains seasonality and flood, the Social Affairs Bureau has ordered the rice merchants not to take the opportunity to raise prices, and when necessary, appropriate measures will be taken. However, what will happen to the rice market after the new harvest? If there is no way to make overall plans, Shanghai will inevitably face great difficulties.</p>
<p>The Flour Industry: Over the years, 50 to 60% of the raw materials have been dependent on the United States and Australia. The reason for this is the decline in the variety of domestic wheat. A peck of American wheat weighs 205.5 pounds. Australian wheat is white and the seeds are thick. A peck of Australian wheat weighs 206 pounds. A peck of Chinese wheat weighs only 166 pounds. Its weight is 39.5 pounds lighter than American wheat and 40 pounds lighter than Australian wheat. If the three types of wheat are placed together, as long as you pick the one that is withered and dirty, you can tell that it is Chinese wheat. The degradation of wheat production to such an extent is disheartening. In addition, when selling and transporting, farmers and vendors add mud and sand to increase the weight and seek improper profits. It is no wonder that flour mills are willing to buy foreign wheat and not domestic wheat. If this continues, domestic wheat will be completely eliminated one day. When that day comes, all the clothing, food, housing, and transportation of the Chinese people can be said to be completely westernized, and the China of China can be imagined. Although there was an inspection of wheat in the past, it was only in name. Recently, the Shanghai Grain Trade Association has taken the initiative to carry out the improvement of wheat production, distributing American and Australian wheat seeds to grain industries in various producing areas across the country before the sowing season for farmers to try planting. It is said that several places in Jiangsu have sown Australian wheat and have achieved considerable results. The industry also started its own wheat inspection on the 1st of this month. If the management is proper, and it is considered to be promoted in various places, Shanghai grain merchants have gradually looked further in recent years and have been able to make a big splash. If they can uphold this spirit and persevere, and the government can maintain supervision, and all parties can provide assistance, there may be a glimmer of hope for the future of the people's food.</p>
<p>The Flour and Wheat Market: Has now lost its autonomy and is completely following the price of gold and the American and Australian wheat market. Recalling the time before and after the outbreak of the European War, Chinese flour was one of the main export products. Today, it is like this, and one cannot help but feel the difference between the past and the present. The worst thing for our flour industry is the dumping of foreign flour. There is Russian flour in the north and American flour in the west. Although the use of foreign wheat by the factory damages our agriculture and squeezes our country's wealth, the labor and capital are still paid by our Chinese people. If it is foreign flour, then what we get is only the meager profit of selling. Moreover, the result of dumping is that Chinese flour mills have no room to stand, and the damage will be immeasurable. As for the method of prevention, we can only invigorate ourselves and actively improve from the food production to seek self-sufficiency. Before we can be completely self-sufficient, we should also inspect the country's supply and demand situation for imported food and impose appropriate restrictions on tariffs at any time. The association has repeatedly suggested this, but it has not yet been realized. As for the future flour and wheat market, it depends on whether the American intention to lend wheat to Germany, as reported the day before, is realized. After it is realized, how will Germany dispose of the wheat? Will it still resell it at the same amount, or will it be processed into flour and sold? On one hand, we need to see how Russia's goal of dumping wheat abroad is. In short, since all the raw materials for China's flour industry are sought abroad, the profits obtained are ultimately meager. Recently, due to the rising water level of the Jiangbei Canal and the opening of the dams for discharge, the wheat-producing areas have been flooded again, resulting in a recent increase of three or four cents in the price of domestic wheat.</p>
<p>Municipal Government</p>
<h3 id="e109">Investigation of Rumors About Extending the Concession <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>It Was Decided That the Public Security and Social Affairs Bureaus Should Investigate Together</p>
<p>The Method of Handling Will Be Determined After a Report Is Received</p>
<p>After all parties expressed their unanimous opposition to the rumors of expanding the concession in western Shanghai, the legitimate merchants and residents in western Shanghai also unanimously denied it. However, the Putong-Songjiang District Municipal Committee and the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession requested the municipal authorities to conduct a thorough investigation to punish the cunning and clarify the truth. A reporter from the New Voice Society visited the Municipal Government again yesterday to inquire about the situation. According to Mayor Zhang, the Municipal Government did not pay attention to the rumors at first because it believed that foreign newspapers often created rumors and had not received a formal report from the citizens. Now that citizens in Putong-Songjiang District and the Taxpayers' Association have requested a thorough investigation, it should be handled. However, since this matter has attracted the attention of all parties, even if the citizens do not request it, it is the duty of the Municipal Government to investigate it to put an end to the rumors and reassure the people. It has been decided by the Municipal Government that the Social Affairs and Public Security Bureaus will conduct a detailed investigation first, and the method of handling will be determined after the investigation is completed.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Women's Relief Association Established Yesterday <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Women's Relief Association held its inaugural meeting at the Junior Evangelism Corps in Xiaoximen at 3:00 PM yesterday. At around 9:00 AM, the preparatory committee members of the association hired a car to travel to various places in Nanshi and Zhabei to distribute propaganda slogans in order to expand publicity. Therefore, more than 500 members of the association and women from various groups attended the meeting in the afternoon, which was a grand occasion in the women's movement. The following is a summary of the main points:</p>
<p>Representatives Attending the Meeting: The male and female representatives who attended the meeting yesterday included Huang Zhaoxiong, representative of the Municipal Party Department; Chen Kecheng, representative of the Municipal Government; Sun Yongyi, representative of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau; Zhang Wenbo, representative of the Second Special District Court; Yang Pei, representative of the Municipal Education Bureau; Chu Huizhen, representative of the Women's Patriotic Goods Promotion Association; Zhu Jie, representative of the National Goods Exhibition Hall; and the Municipal Public Security Bureau Music Team.</p>
<p>Situation of the General Meeting: After the opening ceremony, Chairman Lin Kecong delivered the opening speech, and Huang Xiaoying reported on the preparatory process. Afterwards, guidance was provided by various institutions such as the Municipal Party Department and the Municipal Government. Finally, Ms. Tang Naixin delivered the reply. It was originally intended that the general meeting would elect the members of the general meeting on the same day. However, due to the lack of time, it was decided that the secretaries of each district would be elected first, and then the general meeting would be convened again to elect again. At that time, the original intention was reported by Sun Yongyi, the representative of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau.</p>
<p>Declaration of the General Meeting: The declaration of the general meeting was passed after three readings. Since the flag of the blue sky and white sun has illuminated Shenzhou, the oppressed women of our thousands of years have had a solid guarantee on the path of life. However, deeply rooted evil forces still exert their last lewd power, making you unable to hear with your ears, unable to see with your eyes, unable to move with your limbs, unable to express with your thoughts, let alone talk about obtaining freedom and enjoying equality. However, Rome was not built in a day. It is a dream to turn Moscow into Chicago overnight. The failure to liberate the majority of women cannot be attributed to the failure of the women's movement, but is actually a good medicine to promote the women's movement. The previous women's movement paid attention to active progress and neglected passive relief. As a result, the blessings of liberation only came to a small number of women, and the majority of compatriots are still sinking in the dark prison. If people are not concentrated, the strength will not be strong. If the strength is not strong, the cause will be difficult to achieve. This is originally the law of cause and effect, and the women's movement is no exception. Now, in order to save these mistakes and pave the way for future success, we must strive for passive relief at the same time as active progress, so that the largest and most painful compatriots can get rid of the shackles and see the light of day again, and then stand on a battle line and fight together to achieve the goal of equality between men and women. How to start the work of passive relief? Establish a women's relief association. The evil Shanghai is the nest of demons and the fortress of sin. Women are devastated by feudal forces and oppressed by imperialists. Therefore, painful groans can be heard everywhere, and desolate scenes can be seen at any time. Women are beaten by in-laws and husbands at home, and exploited by factory owners when they go out. The surroundings are either threats like tigers and wolves or poisonous temptations like snakes and scorpions. High-ranking women are insulted like toys, and low-ranking women are used like cattle and horses. Personality is lost, and the joy of life is completely gone. If they are not rescued as soon as possible, it is feared that there will be no women left in Shanghai, which is known as a city of three million people. This is the reason why the association is determined to establish itself as soon as possible. Women's relief work, in other words, is the work of overthrowing evil forces. However, evil forces have their history and their henchmen. It is difficult to achieve victory without a copper trunk and iron arms, wisdom, and good ways. Therefore, we women should be united, aim at the target, and rush forward in the spirit of the Prime Minister's fearlessness, kill all the enemies who oppress women, and ascend to the avenue of equality between men and women together.</p>

<p>Eloping with Money and Clothes</p>
<p>Incited by Tang Fengming</p>
<p>Chen Bian-shi, the 22-year-old wife of Chen Jinbao, a rickshaw driver from Tongzhou residing at No. 60 Pingjili Road in the French Concession, absconded without a trace at 7 PM on the 3rd of this month, taking with her 600 yuan in cash, clothes, and a suitcase. Chen reported the incident to the police and requested an investigation. Chen discovered that Bian-shi was enticed by Tang Fengming from Hubei. On the evening of the 5th, Tang was found at No. 138 Ningkangli, Haining Road in the Public Concession. The police were notified and arrested Tang, sending him to the Huizi Police Station. The French Concession Police sent Detective Liu Youfa to No. 1463 Haining Road, where Bian-shi was arrested. 430 yuan in stolen cash, gold bracelets, watches, pawn tickets, and other items were confiscated and taken back to the French Concession Police Station. Yesterday, they were brought to the Second District Court for investigation. Judge Ge Zhitan of the Criminal Court, along with Prosecutor Lou Guangguang and Clerk Tao Zongkan, presided over the hearing. First, police lawyer Gu Shouxi presented the case, stating that the police were prosecuting based on Articles 256 and 337 of the Criminal Code, charging both incitement and theft, and requested an investigation. Plaintiff Chen Jinbao also submitted a complaint about his wife's abduction. Tang Fengming confessed that he met Bian-shi two years ago while playing mahjong. He claimed that Bian-shi left on her own accord and they met on Taipingqiao Road. She said she was upset because her husband was going to marry a concubine. She wanted to go out and go with him to a Henan hotel for three nights. On the sixth, Bian-shi rented a house herself, and he did not incite her. Chen Bian-shi confessed that her husband had an affair and often beat her, so she left. She met Tang on the road and stayed at a hotel. She left on her own accord and was not incited by Tang. She only took 500 yuan in cash, 300 yuan in banknotes, and 200 yuan from her husband, along with her own gold bracelets and watches, which she used to buy things. Now her husband wants her to go home, and as long as he doesn't hit her in the future, she is willing to go back, etc. Judge Ge verified the confessions and ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody, with the trial rescheduled for August 15. The stolen goods were first returned to the plaintiff.</p>

<p>Zhang Huanzhong</p>
<h3 id="e117">Suicide Due to Economic Pressure <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Huanzhong, a 27-year-old from Ningbo, recently became unemployed and borrowed a room from his friend Zheng Hengda, also from Ningbo, at No. 22 Yuqingli, Xixinqiao, French Concession. He also entrusted Zheng and friends to find business opportunities. Feeling economically distressed, he suddenly had a suicidal thought. Around 5 PM the day before yesterday, he committed suicide by swallowing raw opium at Zheng's place. Zheng and others discovered this and rushed him to Renji Hospital. However, the opium poisoning had spread deeply, and he died around 7 PM that night despite treatment. The hospital notified the police, who sent detectives to move the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall autopsy station. Because no family members were found, the police reported to the Second District Court yesterday morning and commissioned Prosecutor Lou Guangguang, Clerk Zhao Yifen, and forensic doctor Wei Ligong to arrive at the station at 10 AM to examine the body. They confirmed that the body was that of Zhang Huanzhong. According to the Bao Detective, he had learned the previous situation. Zheng Hengda, a friend of the deceased, also testified that he and the deceased were friends, and that he committed suicide by taking poison due to unemployment and financial difficulties. After the discovery, his friends Wang Shigui and Ye Qingsheng accompanied him to the hospital for treatment. He has a mother who lives in Shanghai and works in a sock factory, but he does not know her address. He has already entrusted someone to find her, etc. The officials ruled that Zhang Huanzhong had committed suicide by taking poison. The body was temporarily collected by Tongren Fuyuan Hall, and Zheng Hengda was instructed to investigate his mother's address and bring her to identify the body. After the autopsy, the police took photos and the body was collected by the hall.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Continued Hearing on Zhu Shisheng's Sudden Death Case <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Zhu's Two Daughters Unrelated</p>
<p>Lawsuit Withdrawn First</p>
<p>Zhu Shisheng, a local man who owned the Nanyang Department Store at No. 100 Yangshou Road, argued and wrestled with his step-wife, Zhu Zhang-shi, around 6 PM on the 24th of last month, and Zhu suddenly died. Zhang Xinglin, the son-in-law of Zhu's ex-wife, and daughters Zhang Zhu-shi and Zhu Zhu-shi, reported this to the police, who detained Zhu Zhang-shi and sent her to the Special District Court. Dr. Qin Daoyuan of Tongde Hospital determined that Zhu Shisheng had indeed died from a ruptured blood vessel. Both parties held their own views. After deliberation, a date was set for sentencing. The other day, Zhu Zhang-shi hired lawyers Lin Yingqing and Ye Fukan to sue Zhang Xinglin, Zhang Zhu-shi, and Zhu Zhu-shi for harming their parent. Judge Wu Tingqi opened the court for hearing. According to Zhu Zhang-shi, the reason for the dispute was that Zhang Xinglin had defrauded her of two receipts worth 40,000 taels of silver in the second month of the previous year, intending to embezzle them. She repeatedly demanded their return. On the evening of the 24th of last month, Zhang seized the opportunity and brought more than ten people to beat her and injure her. She had a medical certificate stored in the Yangshupu Police Station. Her husband, Zhu Shisheng, tried to mediate and was pushed and fell, resulting in fatal injuries. It was heard that one of the receipts had already been sold, and the other was kept at a certain lawyer's office. In reality, he had long planned to plot Zhu's family property. The witnesses he invited, Yuan Abao, Li Chunrong, and Yao Fuqing, were all bribed to falsely accuse her. When questioned, Zhang Xinglin and others did not admit to it. Judge Wu instructed Zhu Zhang-shi to re-examine her injuries. Zhang Zhu-shi and Zhu Zhu-shi were deemed unrelated, and the lawsuit was withdrawn first. The hearing was rescheduled for the witnesses to be brought to court for questioning.</p>

<p>Suicide A young woman from Suzhou, Sun Wu-shi, 28 years old, rented a residence at No. 8 Hengdeli, Nine Acres in the city. Because her husband had been unemployed for a long time and their finances were extremely strained, they began to quarrel the night before last. Afterwards, she became depressed and had a suicidal thought. She secretly swallowed raw opium. Around midnight, her husband discovered this and rushed her to Renji Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective. She died at 3:30 AM yesterday. The body was transferred from the hospital to Tongren Fuyuan Hall, awaiting a report to the Second District Court for inspection.</p>

<p>The Publishing Industry Union was established yesterday</p>
<h3 id="e120">Branch Office of the World Bookstore <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Immediately Proposed Thirteen Treatment Conditions</p>
<p>The World Bookstore Branch Office of the Municipal Publishing Industry Union held a membership meeting at 8 AM yesterday at the World Bookstore Main Factory on Dalianwan Road, formally establishing itself. The Publishing Industry Union notified the bureau in advance, requesting a three-hour suspension of work to allow members to participate. The bureau itself announced a day off. On that day, more than 500 people attended, including representatives Wu Jiaze from the Municipal Party Department, Gu Bingyuan from the Social Bureau, Wang Wenhua from the Publishing Industry Union, Chen Yuesheng from the Commercial Branch Office, Huang Zhuting from the China Branch Office, and all employees. Yang Youren, the newly appointed representative to the 15th International Labour Conference, also attended the meeting. The election results and a summary of the conditions are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Election of Directors The public elected Ni Guangming, Zhang Sigen, Zhang Wenbin, Zhai Gusun, and Hong Zhonghua as the presidium. After the ceremonial proceedings, the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting. Representatives of the Party and government agencies delivered training speeches (the speeches are omitted). Ni Guangming, Zhang Sigen, Zhang Wenbin, Gu Xinggen, Xu Zhijie, Su Yixia, Hong Zhonghua, Zhai Gusun, Chen Ningting, and other nine people were elected as directors. Li Dixing, Xi Lindu, Zhang Juntao, and Xi Yuanshen were elected as alternate directors. They were sworn into office on the spot.</p>
<p>Summary of Conditions After the World Bookstore's employees established a branch office, they immediately prepared to request improved treatment from the capitalists. Thirteen conditions were proposed and approved by the conference. The summary is as follows. First, the company should recognize the right of the Shanghai Publishing Industry Union to represent the members of the World Bookstore Branch Office and must subsidize the branch office's operating expenses by 400 yuan per month. Second, salary increases: A. The current minimum wage standard is 25 yuan. Those whose original wage is below 25 yuan will receive an additional 10 yuan (if the increase still does not bring them to 25 yuan, it must be brought up to 25 yuan). Those from 26 to 30 yuan will receive an additional 9 yuan, those from 31 to 35 yuan will receive an additional 8 yuan, those from 36 to 40 yuan will receive an additional 6 yuan, and those above 41 yuan will receive an additional 5 yuan. This applies equally to male and female workers. B. Annual salary increases should be based on the overall average monthly salary of all employees of the Shanghai Head Office, according to the increase in the cost of living, as the standard for universally increasing everyone's salary. If there are odd numbers less than an integer, they should be rounded up to the nearest yuan. For example, if the overall average monthly salary of all employees in the company is 30 yuan and the cost of living index for the 19th year is assumed to be 100 points, and it increases to 110 points for the 20th year, then from January of the 20th year, each person should receive a universal salary increase of 3 yuan per month. The rest is analogous. Both items A and B of the salary increase are proportionate for pieceworkers and contractors. Fourth, working hours: the printing factory and distribution office should have a maximum of eight hours per day. Overtime on weekdays and overtime at night should be calculated at half a day's work for every two hours and one day's work for every four hours. The maximum overtime per day should not exceed four hours, and the maximum overtime per week should not exceed four days. Ninth, workers will uniformly get three days of sick leave per month. Pieceworkers and contractors will be paid proportionately. Eleventh, double pay will be issued at the end of the year. Pieceworkers and contractors will be handled uniformly. Thirteenth, when the company closes its accounts each year, one-tenth of the total surplus will be taken for public debt funds, then 5% for dividends, and the remaining five-tenths will be used for worker bonuses and five-tenths for shareholder dividends.</p>

<p>The Foreign Affairs Office Has No Report</p>
<p>It is rumored that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a report from the Shanghai Office that the body of the missing British national Tao Peng has been found in Jiangsu Province. The cause of the murder is unknown. Yesterday, our reporter specifically interviewed Yang Nianzu, the director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. According to him, the Shanghai Office has absolutely no such report. This matter is completely untrue.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Flooding in Various Districts of the City <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The Social Bureau Sent Personnel to Investigate</p>
<p>Last month, there were continuous heavy rains, the river tide rose sharply, and the river water suddenly increased, resulting in standing water in low-lying areas. Cotton, rice, melons, and beans were mostly submerged. In addition, the weather was changeable, suddenly cold and hot, which had a significant impact on the growth of crops. For example, in Pudong, where the terrain is relatively high and the drainage is good, the cotton and beans were in the flowering and fruiting stage, the rice was sprouting, and the melons were being harvested. After this continuous rain and cold, the roots rotted, the leaves withered, and growth stopped, which is very regrettable. After the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau received reports from municipal councilors in the Fahua and other districts about the flooding, it sent personnel to various districts to investigate. This has now been completed. The inspection report will be compiled, and statistics will be submitted to the government for the record, and plans will be made to provide relief.</p>
<p>Various Charity Organizations</p>
<h3 id="e124">Reports Received from Various Provinces Regarding Flooding <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Red Cross Society The Chinese Red Cross Society received a telegram from member Feng Liangfei stating that on the fifth day of the sixth lunar month, there was heavy rain, which continued until the tenth day. Torrential floods, originating from Huizhou, Shexian, Jingxian, and Jingxian, flowed straight down, bursting the river in Dongmei Village, Xixiang, Xuanyi County, and changing the river course. The waters of the Tongjin Bridge and the Qiyi and Hanting Rivers converged at Xixihe Town, washing away seventy or eighty shops, as well as the Tao family in Taojiayuan. A total of more than 1,000 people were drowned. It was even more tragic than the Yijiang flood of the eleventh year. Except for the Luo Gong and Shen Gong embankments, the Taifeng and other embankments in Nanyi, the downstream area, were breached, and corpses were floating everywhere, beyond rescue. The smoke from cooking fires was almost extinguished for hundreds of miles, and epidemics were rampant, with no food or medicine available, leading to imminent death. These are all confirmed circumstances. Liangfei, as a member, could not bear to stand idly by. He attached a film showing the tragic situation and sent a telegram to the president and chairman of the board, requesting an urgent relief effort to relieve the pressing needs. Both the living and the dead will be grateful. Member Feng Liangfei sends his heartfelt greetings. The Chinese Nationalist Party's Dangtu County Party Affairs Rectification Committee in Anhui Province telegraphed the Chinese Red Cross Society stating that Dangtu borders rivers and lakes, and the land is mostly low-lying. Heavy rain fell in the summer, causing floods. The areas where the floods spread have destroyed 500,000 to 600,000 mu of fields and affected no fewer than 200,000 people. On nights of bitter rain and chilling winds, the sound of heartbroken cries is often heard. In the midst of terrifying waves, countless white bones are swept away. Homes are destroyed, villages are reduced to ruins, belongings are gone, and crops are lost. The situation is truly unprecedented in recent decades. The Daguan embankment, which is related to the economic lifeline of the county's rural areas, was also breached by the rising river tide. Observing the gaunt faces and the hunger on the roads, with no wheat or rice, how can the common people be consoled? Our association feels ashamed for lacking the ability to turn stones into gold, making it difficult to preserve the remaining people. We can only call out on behalf of the suffering and hope to alleviate the disaster in the night. We have always admired your reputation for righteousness and your enthusiasm for saving the people. We dare to ask you to quickly distribute relief grain so that the disaster victims can receive the grace of your benevolence, be reborn with joy, and alleviate the great suffering of the drought fish. The benefits will be limitless. In urgent circumstances, we cannot choose our words carefully. Please examine this carefully. The Chinese Nationalist Party's Dangtu County Party Affairs in Anhui reverently implores.</p>
<p>Chinese and Foreign Relief Association The Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Relief Association received a telegram from the village chiefs of Hepingli, Changxing County, Zhejiang Province, stating that since the beginning of summer, there has been heavy rain in the Heping area. Many dams, bridges, and houses have been submerged and collapsed. Countless grains, livestock, and equipment have been lost. A disaster has formed, and there is no hope for the autumn harvest. The victims are eating in the wind and sleeping in the open air, crying everywhere. They also received a telegram from the Farmers Association of Anji County, Zhejiang Province, stating that since the beginning of summer, there have been heavy rains day and night, and mountain floods have broken out. All dams have collapsed, and fields have been submerged. It is even more difficult to calculate the number of houses and livestock that have been washed away. The Disaster Relief Committee of Liuhe County, Jiangsu Province, telegraphed that since the great drought in the eighteenth year, this is the worst flood in more than eighty years. Since the beginning of the month, there has been continuous heavy rain, and the embankments and fields on the southwest and east sides have collapsed and been completely submerged. The livestock, houses, and rations have also been washed away. All 360,000 people in the county have been affected. Cooking fires have been extinguished, and there is no sound of chickens or dogs. The situation is extremely critical and cannot be sustained. The Jiangsu Xiaoxian County Government telegraphed that since May, there has been heavy rain, the worst in more than a decade. The entire county has become a swamp, and boats can be rowed on flat ground. The autumn crops have been completely submerged, and countless houses have collapsed. The source of livelihood has been cut off, and there is extreme panic. The Jiangsu Baoying people telegraphed that there has been a lot of rain this summer, and the rivers and lakes have risen. The embankments have collapsed one after another, and countless houses and fields have been washed away. Hundreds of miles are covered in water. Residents have nowhere to live, clinging to the tops of trees, swaying in the wind and rain, and calling for help with no way to get it. It is unbearable to see people waiting to die. The Jiangsu Huai'an Public Law Groups telegraphed that the county has suffered disasters for the past three years, and the people have been unable to bear it. Unexpectedly, there has been continuous heavy rain since July. The embankments and fields in the four rural areas have been submerged one after another, and many fields and houses have been washed away. Tens of thousands of victims are crying to the heavens. The Fuyang and Yingzhou Water Disaster Relief Temporary Committee sent a public letter stating that since the harvest of two wheat crops in mid-June of this year, there has been continuous rain for a month. Then, mountain floods broke out, and Jiaoshui flooded across the countryside. In an instant, thousands of miles turned into swamps. In low-lying areas, people could not escape and were buried in the stomachs of fish with their families. Countless livestock and houses were washed away, leaving nothing behind. Those who were fortunate enough to escape were displaced, with only their lives spared. Family members were lost, and they had no food or clothing. They cried out for hunger and help. The situation was too terrible to bear, and relief was urgently needed.</p>

<p>Chongqing Cannot Unload Goods This time the high water disaster, from the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, reached all the way to the Sichuan River, covering the provinces of Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, and Sichuan. Shipping on the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River has been hindered. Chongqing, Sichuan, was initially still open for freight, but on the 7th, there was heavy rain again, and the river water in Chongqing suddenly rose, 24 feet higher than usual. It has already flooded the shore. The local shipping companies received a telegram from that port yesterday saying that the streets have been submerged in water, and goods cannot be loaded or unloaded at the docks. Ships arriving in Chongqing cannot unload their cargo, and cargo going downstream has no way to board ships. Transportation on the Sichuan River will be interrupted.</p>
<p>Hankou Barges Enter the City Efforts are being made to pump out the floodwaters in Hankou, but there was heavy rain again the day before yesterday, causing the floodwaters in the city to deepen. The cargo warehouses on the docks of the various ships that had not built dikes were completely submerged in water. Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, and China Merchants warehouses, which took earlier precautions, also had water depths of about a foot in the lower levels. According to Hankou's telegram yesterday, the passengers and cargo of the various river ships that arrived in Hankou on the 7th were transferred by small barges directly into the city. The streets and roads were purely used for boat crossings to provide transportation to and from the city. Many of the goods going from Shanghai were stopped from loading unless they were urgently needed. The goods that were being rushed were the necessities of life, such as white rice, wheat flour, sugar, piece goods, cotton yarn, and medicine. The rest of the goods have been temporarily stopped from loading.</p>

<p>The Crew Was Safe</p>
<p>Chen Yongxing, a fishing boat from Ningbo, loaded with sand and jellyfish from Sijiao Mountain, came to Shanghai to sell its goods. On the evening of the day before yesterday (the 7th), when it was sailing to the surface of the Shahua kerosene pool in Gaohua, Songnan, it happened to encounter a small steamer of a certain company towing a barge. Due to a moment of carelessness, the fishing boat was damaged and the hold flooded, causing it to sink immediately. The six helmsmen and sailors on board, seeing that the situation was not good, all jumped onto the small steamer, avoiding danger. After the two helmsmen of the fishing boat took the small steamer to the steamer company and reported the accident, they returned to Wusong yesterday. The shipowner, Chen Jiabing, issued a loss report and submitted it to the Customs River Affairs Office, requesting compensation from the steamer company. It is reported that the loss of the ship and cargo is estimated to be more than 3,000 yuan.</p>

<p>To the Editor of Shen Bao:</p>
<p>I, Fu Rongze, am writing in response to the report in your newspaper on the 5th of this month concerning the dispute between Lu Chengxiao, manager of the China Iron Factory, and Chen Zonglian over a sales transaction. I am deeply shocked to find that the report implicates me, Rongze, in many aspects of the case. I have never contacted the 26th Division of the Army regarding any matters. It is Chen Zonglian who is groundlessly implicating me by bringing a suit to court. At the time, I, Rongze, was working far away and was unable to return to Shanghai to clarify the matter. Furthermore, due to my nationality, I am unable to appear in court to provide a statement. As a result, Chen Zonglian is recklessly making false accusations. Although I am being wronged for the time being, the truth will eventually come to light. Since I have no intention of hiding and have not been detained, I request that you promptly issue a correction. I am sending this letter to inform you of the situation and request that you investigate and promptly correct the record.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Du Xuewen, Attorney-at-Law</p>

<h3 id="e139">Subsidies for Educational Institutions Affected by Disasters <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Changsha Dispatch: Among the areas harmed by the Communists, Hunan is second only to Jiangxi in the severity of the damage. In the past two years, approximately thirty counties in Hunan Province have been raided by Communist bandits. The losses of public and private property are incalculable. In terms of educational institutions, many local libraries and popular education centers have been burned down. As for schools, they have either been burned or destroyed. As a result, they are unable to open, or if they do open, they face many difficulties due to inadequate equipment, which greatly hinders the progress of education. Therefore, He Jian has allocated 60,000 yuan from disaster relief funds to the Department of Education to be distributed based on the severity of the damage. Huang Zhengheng convened a joint meeting of the heads of relevant institutions at 2:00 PM on the 3rd, attended by over ten people. Hu Yiru presided over the meeting. After formal greetings, the following items were discussed:</p>
<p>(1) How should the funds be distributed between the provincial capital and the counties affected by the Communist bandits? It was decided that 60% (36,000 yuan) would be distributed to the counties and 40% (24,000 yuan) to the provincial capital.</p>
<p>(2) From what time period should the educational institutions affected by the Communist bandits be considered? It was decided to include institutions affected from July 1920 to July 18, 1921.</p>
<p>(3) How should the counties affected by the Communist bandits be classified for subsidies? It was decided to divide the counties into two categories, A and B, except for Pingjiang and Liuyang counties, which have already been approved for subsidies by the provincial government and will not be included in this allocation. (A) Counties that have been captured by Communist bandits two or more times will be classified as Category A, including six counties: Huarong, Chaling, Nanxian, Youxian, Anren, and Poyang, each receiving 1,800 yuan. (B) Counties that have been captured by Communist bandits once, or have not been captured but have suffered severe damage from banditry, will be classified as Category B, including seventeen counties: Changsha, Yueyang, Xiangyin, Shimen, Linli, Lixian, Liling, Sangzhi, Zixing, Yongxing, Tongdao, Anxiang, Daoxian, Cili, Dayong, Wugang, and Xinning, each receiving 1,000 yuan. (3) The remaining 3,200 yuan will be kept in the custody of the Department of Education to be used as needed. It was decided to pass the motion.</p>
<p>(4) Should provincial educational institutions that have suffered losses from Communist bandits be subsidized? It was decided that, except for the Library and Museum, which have not yet been restored, provincial educational institutions that have already been restored will not be subsidized.</p>
<p>(5) On what basis should the educational institutions in the provincial capital that have suffered losses from bandits be subsidized? It was decided that: (A) The Library and Museum will each receive 5,000 yuan, totaling 10,000 yuan, as a foundation for restoration. (B) Subsidies will be divided into five categories: A, B, C, D, and E, based on reported losses. Losses of 20,000 yuan or more will be classified as Category A, 10,000 yuan or more as Category B, 5,000 yuan or more as Category C, 2,000 yuan or more as Category D, and less than 2,000 yuan as Category E. (C) Each school in Category A will receive 900 yuan, Category B 500 yuan, Category C 350 yuan, Category D 250 yuan, and Category E 150 yuan. (D) The remaining funds will be kept in the custody of the Department of Education to be used as needed.</p>
<p>(6) How should the use of the subsidies be regulated? It was decided that they should be used exclusively for educational equipment and not for personal losses. Furthermore, the Department of Education should be notified of the equipment purchased for record keeping. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>

<h3 id="e140">Pei Yili Not Sent to Inspect Education <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>A previous report stated that the Central News Agency in Shenyang reported on the 3rd that the Ministry of Education had sent the British consultant Pei Yili to Liaoning to inspect popular education. He arrived in Shenyang yesterday and was guided by officials from the Department of Education to inspect various schools. The Ministry of Education stated that the Ministry has no consultant named Pei Yili, nor did it send anyone to Liaoning for inspection. The above news is quite surprising and may involve someone fraudulently claiming to be a consultant. The Ministry ordered the Department of Education of Liaoning Province to investigate and report back. It has now been learned that Director Jin of the Department of Education has found that Pei Yili is promoting vocational supplementary education in Liaoning in his personal capacity and has not inspected popular education as a consultant sent by the Ministry. It is reported that the Department of Education has truthfully reported this to the Ministry for verification.</p>

<h3 id="e141">Instructions Regarding Teaching Methods <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Order to the Department of Education of the Eastern Provinces Special District</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education, according to the Department of Education of the Eastern Provinces Special District, submitted an inspection report for the first semester of the 19th year for review. The Ministry of Education instructed that the report and the submitted documents are noted. It is found that the criticisms of the conditions of elementary and middle schools in various subjects by the inspectors are quite detailed, and the Department's rewards and punishments are handled appropriately. However, upon reviewing the report, it appears that the teaching methods in various elementary and middle schools completely adopt the lecture method. There is too little spontaneous activity by students in the classroom, which is inappropriate. The Department should instruct all schools to study the teaching methods of each subject in the future, appropriately reduce lecture-style teaching based on the nature of the curriculum, and guide students to learn independently in order to improve teaching effectiveness. This should be followed accordingly.</p>
<p>Zhejiang Province's Education Expenses in Arrears in Various Counties</p>
<h3 id="e142">Educational Bonds Issued to Repay Loans <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Educational funding in various counties of Zhejiang Province is stretched thin, and all feel financially exhausted. Therefore, during months of peak land tax collection, the surcharge income can barely provide support. However, during off-peak collection periods, it is necessary to borrow money to cope. Now that county treasuries have been established and provincial and local taxes have been separated, there is no room for diversion of funds. If loans are taken from private banks, the interest rates are very high during normal times, and even higher during times of financial stringency, requiring discount losses. The annual interest rate is estimated to be around 2%. If the principal cannot be repaid when due, the interest is compounded, further increasing the burden. If this continues, the educational funding of various counties may eventually become bankrupt. It is now proposed that various counties issue educational bonds specifically to repay educational loans and not to be used for other purposes. These bonds can be easily raised locally. The annual interest rate will be half that of loans from private banks, and the reduced interest can be saved for future repayment of the principal. This seems to be a win-win situation. This proposal was previously resolved by the Education Bureau of this province for educational funding, and can be used by the counties with deficits as a reference. The Department of Education has now approved the measures, and the counties will consider their current situations and decide whether to issue bonds. The measures are recorded below:</p>
<p>1.  When issuing these bonds, each county must first submit a report to the provincial government for approval and record keeping.</p>
<p>2.  The total amount of bonds issued by each county shall be no less than 5,000 yuan and no more than 20,000 yuan.</p>
<p>3.  The annual interest rate of these bonds shall be 7%.</p>
<p>4.  At a rate of ____% public____, the actual revenue will be 98%.</p>
<p>5.  Within five years, interest shall be paid in two installments per year. After five years, 20% of the principal shall be repaid each year by drawing lots.</p>
<p>6.  These bonds shall be guaranteed by the educational surcharge revenue of each county, and a certain amount of national currency shall be set aside each year from the surcharge and deposited in a reputable bank, with half used for interest payments and half used for principal repayments after five years.</p>
<p>7.  The bond interest coupons may be used to offset educational surcharges on land tax and ____ funds.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Jiangyin Education Budget Inadequate <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>The educational budget for the 20th year in Jiangyin, after being repeatedly revised by the Education Bureau and submitted to the county government for forwarding to the Department of Education, has been instructed to the effect that the submitted budget did not comply with the previous order to modify the number of mu donations for the Yishe (righteous society) and due to actual deficits, they dare not use them and therefore they were not included. The method is actually inappropriate. Even if they intend to protect customers, the actual shortage of donations to Yishe, should also be included in the second reserve fund and indicating the number of months. It should be returned for rewriting. The educational plan is generally appropriate, but attention should be paid to several points: (1) The one-year rural normal undergraduate program should be temporarily suspended and the funds used for equipment. (2) The title of substitute elementary school should be canceled and changed to district-run, but standards should be set. (3) The compulsory practice area should be changed to a compulsory education test area, and a preliminary plan for elementary school should be quickly drafted and submitted for approval before it can be opened. (4) New schools or grades must be submitted for approval before they can be started or funds can be spent. (5) The establishment and implementation of the Civil Education Center must be carried out in accordance with the Department's Order No. 6058.</p>

<p>The city education funds collected from the dental tax have been collected and stored by the County Finance Bureau since the division of the city and county. Now, County Magistrate Yan believes that this tax should be returned to the city to clarify the boundaries. However, because the county's public security urgently needs to purchase uniforms for the police and open supplementary schools, the funds are very tight. He immediately submitted a report to the Municipal Government, and Mayor Zhang instructed that it be used to offset the county's public security expenses. Therefore, County Magistrate Yan ordered the County Finance Bureau to remit all the city education fees collected from the dental tax from October 1928 to March 1931 to the county government for verification and collection yesterday.</p>

<h3 id="e147">New Developments in the Zhongda School of Commerce <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Adding Girls' Dormitories 丨 Implementing Scientific Management</p>
<p>The Zhongda School of Commerce in this city has been developing rapidly recently. This year's new student examination admitted a total of seventy-six regular students, and there are many auditors. The original buildings are insufficient for use. It was originally planned to build separate dormitories for male and female students, but because the school site is too small, adding buildings would be too crowded. Therefore, the male student dormitory will be temporarily rented nearby, and will be expanded when a suitable location is found. As for the female students' dormitory, renting private houses off-campus is very inconvenient, so Dean Xu decided to add several girls' dormitories on campus for management purposes. However, the funds are extremely tight, so Dean Xu contacted the Shanghai Bank for a loan. It is now heard that the Bank of China has agreed to lend some money. It is also heard that the school has been implementing various scientific management methods since this year. Dean Xu also believes that the student fee collection process is troublesome due to the increase in students this year, so he has asked the Shanghai Branch of the Bank of China and its offices to be fee payment agencies for students. The parents of new and old students have been notified to pay all fees to the Bank of China before they can register for classes at the school. In addition, Professor Ling Shumo, a newly hired professor, has been temporarily granted leave for a few months due to the Hunan University's emphasis on him, and Zhang Sumin has been introduced as his replacement. It is found that Mr. Zhang has studied in the United States for many years and has a doctoral degree, and is very knowledgeable and experienced. Professor Xue Xianzhou's wife, another newly hired professor, has also requested leave due to personal matters. In addition to the above, the school has hired Wang Zhixin, Zhao Junhao, and Liu Youxin, who are experts in various subjects. In addition, there are many teaching assistants and assistants who are graduates of this school and specialize in research, auditing, investigation, proofreading, and other work. Now, the affiliated institutions of the school, such as the Industrial and Commercial Survey Department, the Practice Bank, and the Consumer Cooperative, are being actively reorganized. It is also heard that the Industrial and Commercial Survey Department will publish financial guidance in the near future.</p>

<p>— Qiu Shui</p>
<p>Language should not be rude or violent, as that is not gentlemanly. However, it should also not be overly restrained, as that is not elegant.</p>
<p>A saying goes, "Words are the voice of the heart." However, are there not those in the world who speak insincerely? How is this saying to be interpreted then?</p>
<p>The true essence of freedom is responsibility. Therefore, those who truly understand freedom will never demand it.</p>
<p>If people could all understand the true meaning of truth, money, and success, then they would naturally treat others with frankness, generosity, and humility.</p>
<p>A person's intelligence or foolishness is not determined by the amount of their experience, but by the extent of their ability to acquire experience.</p>
<p>Those who stare at women's faces on the street like eagles swooping down on chickens are not necessarily lustful. The mere act of "looking" is not enough to satisfy the desires of a "lustful" person.</p>
<p>To elevate the character of women, the first thing to do is to abolish bizarre and glamorous clothing. Bizarre and glamorous clothing can only gain the love of men, but is not enough to gain admiration. The more one seeks love from others, the more base one's character becomes.</p>
<p>Killing a foreigner in China can lead to China's immediate demise. Killing thousands of Chinese people abroad results in nothing being said or done. There is no justice or humanity in the world. If there is, it only comes from the mouths of the weak.</p>
<p>Boycotting Japanese goods is not because the Chinese people's enthusiasm is low and can only last for five minutes, but because there are many things that we must rely on them for. Therefore, to permanently boycott Japanese goods, the best thing to do is to promote domestic products.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Colonel Lindbergh's Flight to China <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— Lü Bing</p>
<p>Colonel Lindbergh's recent long-distance flight passed through the Far East. Our country will prepare an international reception to express our welcome. People in Shanghai, hearing this news, all consider it fortunate to have a glimpse of the world's most famous aviator. The success of Lindbergh's flight was truly in May 1927. At that time, Lindbergh created an unprecedented record for the air route between Paris and New York. For a time, his name spread far and wide, and newspapers in various countries published as much information as possible about his achievements and photos. People in France and America, in particular, were wildly enthusiastic throughout the country. Wherever Lindbergh set foot, unplanned gatherings often resulted in streets being deserted.</p>
<p>Regarding Lindbergh's past, one thing he can be proud of is that in the three months after his successful flight between America and France, the number of letters and telegrams he received was the highest in the world. According to statistics at the time, in less than sixty days, he received more than three and a half million congratulatory letters, more than ten thousand congratulatory telegrams, and approximately 15,000 parcels of gifts. Postal and telegraph personnel in Europe and America specially worked overtime for Lindbergh, busy coping with the situation, which was a phenomenon that had never been seen before.</p>
<p>Lindbergh, having received such a flood of letters and telegrams, should have replied to them as a matter of course. Therefore, in 1927, when he was in Paris, he specifically rented a huge residence for the purpose of handling personal replies. The American Minister, Mr. Herrick, specially sent eight secretaries to assist him in his work. Unexpectedly, the letters were like snowflakes, almost causing the eight secretaries to be dumbfounded and unable to handle them. Later, he borrowed fifteen secretaries from the Paris Chamber of Commerce before he was able to send out more than 200,000 reply letters and thank-you notes in six weeks.</p>
<p>The above sections are all recorded in European and American newspapers and magazines, and are not conjecture. Recollecting Lindbergh's sensation throughout the global community was like this. It can truly be said that he is the most famous person in the aviation world of this century. I am bringing this up before Lindbergh flies through the Far East, hoping that it will also be something that readers will be happy to know about.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Wuxi's White Little Maiden Melon <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Die</p>
<p>The melons of Wuxi, there is one named White Little Maiden, which is a fine variety. It is produced in places such as Shitangwan and Luoshe. It is small and oval in shape, a type of sweet melon. Its color is pure white like jade, crystal clear like snow. Its fragrance spreads far and wide, like that of a snow pear. Its taste is sweet and tender, hence the name. It is just like the lychee being called Green-Clad Lad, or the pine tree being named Grey-Bearded Elder, and this is even more beautiful. A friend bought some yesterday as a gift, and included a note saying, "To dispel heat and generate coolness, I present the White Little Maiden. No need for a golden house, please taste this special flavor. If you deem it a precious gift, please compose a new poem." I received it and played with it, then ate it, feeling that its appearance was pleasing and its taste even more so. Surely a poem is needed. Therefore, I casually composed a poem to praise it, saying, "Moon-like beauty, snow-like skin, emerging from the fields with graceful form. Why compare your jade body to Sweet Gan? You should be called Fen'er instead. Stealing coolness and dispelling the summer heat, quenching thirst and comforting longing. Pity that you are marrying a man of money, like a cardamom bud about to bloom." This is also a poem on objects with a unique flavor.</p>
<h3 id="e166">An Account of Zhu Yongkui's Exquisite Ivory Carving Skills <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Chonglou</p>
<p>Zhu Yongkui from Kuimen has exquisite ivory carving skills. He can carve hundreds of characters on a piece of ivory the size of a melon seed, in various scripts. Through a friend's introduction, I got to know him. Zhu is just over twenty years old. He studies in Shanghai, is intelligent and eager to learn, but is taciturn. Those who do not know him are unaware that he possesses such skills.</p>
<p>I work at the Wuzhou Pharmacy. One day, Zhu came to visit, bringing with him an ivory seal he had carved. The seal was less than an inch long and not even a third of an inch wide. Yet on one side, he had carved the entire "Spring Rhapsody" by Yu Xin, totaling more than four hundred characters. The naked eye could barely make them out. But when viewed under a microscope, the characters were slender and firm, and the rows were neat and orderly. Everyone present passed it around, marveling at it. A colleague asked, "Ancient people praised excellent carvings as being done by the hands of ghosts. Your skill surpasses that of the ancients. Is there some secret technique involved?" Zhu replied, "These are all exaggerations. When I was seven or eight years old, I enjoyed carving. At first, I only carved larger things. Then, I gradually moved from large to small, from small to tiny. After more than ten years of practice, I can now use the tools freely. Skill comes from practice. There is no other way." Zhu's words were like this. I, however, believe that the achievement of an art is half due to human effort and half due to natural talent. Zhu is perhaps too modest in his words. However, this further demonstrates his virtue of not boasting about his talents.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Tragic News of the Flood in Furong Embankment <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— Ren Nongxuan</p>
<p>About fifty li outside the North Gate of Wuxi, there is a large embankment called Furong. It was originally Furong Lake. Every autumn, many hibiscus flowers were produced, hence the name. During the Ming dynasty, Zhou Wenxiang, Minister of Works, came here on a southern inspection tour. He used soldiers instead of laborers to manage the lake and turn it into fields. Since then, farmers from various places have come to cultivate the land, and it has been more than four hundred years. It is sixty-three square li in circumference, with a total of 68,000 mu of fields and more than 200,000 farmers. It borders Jiangyin and Wujin counties. The terrain is low-lying, shaped like an upturned cauldron. It is known as land unsuitable for wheat. It is surrounded by mountains on all sides, where the virtuous Lu Guimeng of old lived in seclusion. Unexpectedly, at the end of June this summer, continuous rain fell. The water in the fields accumulated to about three feet. Most farmers rented water pumps to try to save the crops. At a time when silkworms were devastated, economic difficulties were severe. They pawned their clothes and bedding, hoping to save the rotting seedlings and salvage something. However, after everything had been pawned and they could borrow no more, on the afternoon of July 18, dark clouds suddenly gathered again, and torrential rain poured down, accompanied by mountain torrents. The river water outside the embankment rose sharply by more than ten feet. In about a week, a total of four feet and eight inches of rain fell. The fields and gardens turned into a watery kingdom, boundless and without end. This year's autumn harvest is completely hopeless. It is now reported that all the farmers, big and small, in the embankment are living in waterlogged houses, sleeping on planks. Kitchens have become canals, and they are cooking with urns, exposed to the wind and dew, crying out for food. The various tragic scenes are unbearable to witness. Therefore, the township head and others have jointly submitted a report to the county government, requesting immediate relief. We deeply hope that philanthropists within the country will generously donate to help these disaster victims. (No payment accepted)</p>

<h3 id="e168">Reminiscences of Spending Summer at West Lake (II) <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— Yuan Rongfang</p>
<p>In recent years, the lotus flowers on the lake, those at Three Pools Mirroring the Moon, are the best. Every May and June when the flowers bloom, tourists flock there. It is as Yuan Mei said, "Amidst the deep red lotus flowers, painted boats are added." The pools are in the middle of the lake, and one must take a gondola to get there. It is hotter at noon. I went there either early in the morning or late in the evening. The houses there are winding, and the flowers and trees are lush. The character pavilion is built in the water, connected on all sides by winding stone bridges. The vermilion railings are hidden, as if entering a painting. It is a great place to admire the lotus flowers. Leaning on the railing and looking around, one sees round canopies swaying with greenery, long hairpins blooming with red. The clear fragrance is intoxicating, like drinking fine wine. An ancient poem says, "Enjoying the world of white lotus flowers, lying in the middle with the wind coming from all directions." This can be experienced here.</p>
<p>Lingyin Temple has secluded scenery, and its coolness is especially suitable for summer. Since the construction of the Circum-Lake Road, motorcycles can go directly to outside the Huilong Bridge. One can go in the morning and return in the evening, making transportation convenient. Therefore, more and more people visit. Every summer, wearing a linen shirt and holding a banana leaf fan, I often wander under Feilai Peak. Feilai Peak is located in front of Yunlin Temple. The jade screen stands tall, strangely protruding and winding, possessing the wonders of thinness, transparency, and wrinkling. Ancient trees and strange trees grow all around the peak. Iron trunks and withered branches have roots growing in stone gullies. Emerald umbrellas are layered, forming an emerald canopy. One sees only green clouds filling the sky and emerald shade covering the ground. Sometimes, the wind blows, moving the trees, and fragmented sunlight leaks through the gaps in the trees, flickering and swaying on the rocks, as if spying on people. It is especially interesting to appreciate the flying spring in the Cold Spring Pavilion or the Helai Pavilion. Splashing white and dripping emerald, winding and zigzagging, tinkling like playing the zither and zither. The wind rustles through the stone gullies, and the coolness penetrates the bones. The mind and spirit are refreshed, giving one a feeling of wanting to become an immortal. Every time I go to Lingyin, I linger, reluctant to leave.</p>
<p>Yunqi is located in the northwest of Wuyun Mountain. I love Lingyin for its openness, and I love Yunqi for its seclusion. It is a pity that it is farther from the city. From the city, take a motorcycle to Liuhe Pagoda, pass Fancun, and go north for several li to Sanju Pavilion. Then, walk another hundred steps to Xixin Pavilion. The entire way is a winding path, paved with stones in a shattered ice pattern. The moss is thick in the cracks of the stones. Walking on it is like walking on brocade. Tens of thousands of tall bamboos surround the path, blocking the sun. One only feels the greenness assaulting the eyes and the coolness assailing the sleeves. The seclusion and beauty are indescribable. Every time I walk in it, I walk slowly, fearing that the beautiful scenery will soon end. The chirping of birds is pleasant to the ear, like playing immortal music. Xixin Pavilion faces north, with two windows opening, reflecting the green smoke. The sound of the spring is ding-dong, like the tinkling of jade pendants. Resting for a while, the dust is washed away, and coolness arises from the elbows and armpits, almost forgetting that it is high summer. Going further, one is surrounded by ancient trees. Yunlin Temple is there.</p>

<p>— Yao Su Feng</p>
<p>Like a newly married couple going on their honeymoon, everything feels warm and sweet. They can forget the shaking of the wheels, forget the fatigue of the journey, as if in a fleeting moment, they have arrived in Suzhou.</p>
<p>Still the sound of cars, the sound of people, jumping around the station, Mr. Lu did not feel any different from two days ago, but Miss Ding was harboring endless new interest. The car stopped, she poked her head out of the car window to look at the scenery at the station.</p>
<p>"Ayao...gardenia...flower?..." From the chaos of shouts, she suddenly grasped a lovely soft Wu dialect; then there was a thick, greasy floral fragrance lingering in her nostrils.</p>
<p>"Buy flowers!" she shouted.</p>
<p>Mr. Lu was carrying his suitcase, preparing to get off the bus. When he heard Miss Ding shouting to buy flowers, his heart jumped. But when he glanced out the car window and saw a woman carrying a basket of flowers running towards him quickly, he felt the urgency of the moment even more.</p>
<p>He had no choice but to deliberately turn his back to the car window, take out two dimes from his pocket, hurriedly throw them on the small table, look at the other side, and his heart kept pounding wildly.</p>
<p>Miss Ding insisted on pulling him and asking, "Do you want to sell two flowers too?"</p>
<p>"Alright! Let's get off the bus! The bus is leaving soon!" He was extremely embarrassed.</p>
<p>The flower-selling woman outside the car window did not initially notice who was standing in the car window after the first transaction was successful. But when Miss Ding turned her head and asked Mr. Lu, she could not help but look up, expecting a second transaction. It was then that she became suspicious.</p>
<p>She only felt that the man's back looked just like her family's Xiao Rong, but she could not be sure whether the man was indeed Xiao Rong or not. She stared intently, but the man never turned around. Finally, she laughed at herself. She just thought; the man and the woman came together: if it was really Xiao Rong, how could he be with such a beautiful woman? So she laughed at her own suspicion and went to find other customers with her basket.</p>
<p>On the other side, Mr. Lu hurriedly pulled Miss Ding off the bus, trying hard to avoid being discovered by his wife: with great difficulty, he squeezed out of the station in the crowd, and only then did he feel relieved.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, another sharp shout made Mr. Lu unable to help but secretly cry out in pain.</p>
<p>"Xiao Rong! Xiao Rong!" Mr. Lu could clearly hear that it was the voice of the young boy on his family's carriage.</p>
<p>At first, he wanted to pretend he didn't hear, but the young boy was already standing beside him.</p>

<h3 id="e171">The Gold Market Slightly Weakens <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>There is talk that cash shipments north have been returned. Yesterday, on the 8th, the gold market experienced some fluctuations, with a generally weakening trend, fluctuating by two or three taels. From noon onwards, the total difference was seven taels, resulting in a slightly inferior result of one tael. Each exchange house took its own course, while sentiment was hesitant and uncertain. The silver market's slight decline was not taken seriously. In addition, rising U.S. stocks opened lower. Soon after, foreign exchange both domestically and abroad was tight. Sterling was at 12.9375, and the price turned advantageous, increasing by four or five taels. Suddenly, it was reported that cash shipments to other ports from Tianjin and other banks had been returned due to obstruction. As the news spread, the market price quickly fell sharply, causing a storm. Sellers became aggressive and broke the 50-tael mark. Later, because the exchange rate stabilized, prices rebounded. As the market approached the weekend close, conditions shifted from weak to strong. The difference between the highest and lowest prices of the week was 20 taels, with a total rebound of 10 taels.</p>
<p>The Silver Price Slightly Decreases Before Rebounding After Opening Lower. The market opened lower this morning, decreasing by two taels to 750 taels and eight qian. Large bars and silver prices were each 1/8 lower, but private telegraphs dropped by 5/16, immediately rising to 54.5 taels. Dada Cheng and Hengxing Yuan bought in, and the Bank of China and Japanese banks sold forward three-cent bonds and near-term two-cent bonds at .9375. Later, Wansing, Yuanheng, Shunli Yuanmao Yong, and others sold, immediately causing a drop of more than two taels to 52 taels and three qian. The opening order had already been placed at a small 125, with the U.S. dollar at 2.5 jiao and the Japanese dollar increased by 1.5 fen, at 53 taels and eight qian. Then it added five liang and one qian, and then lowered it again by seven or eight qian.</p>
<p>Various Exchanges Rush to Increase Prices by Two Taels. Da De Cheng, Yi Yu, Fuxing Yong, Xie Xing Yong, Richang, and others bought in, and due to interbank trading of sterling at .9375, various exchanges rushed to sell. The price for the 90th month was the same at .9375, so the gold price immediately rose by two taels to 55 taels and eight qian. Later, due to a sudden rumor that spot goods could not be issued, people were frightened. Major players sold off aggressively, such as Yuanmao Yong, Hengyu, Zhifeng Yong, Cuichang Yong, and the Dalian banks. At 10:30, it was only 50 taels. Not long after, it rose back to 12 taels because Yuanxing Yong, Yifeng Yong, Yuanchun, and others bought, at 52 taels and one qian. At 10:45, sellers suddenly became active, and sterling was sold to banks for three cents, causing another drop of three taels and several qian to 48 taels and a half at 11:00. Then, Yongfeng, the Dalian banks, Yuancheng, and others bought in, and Indian exchange reported a small two annas, resuming customs clearance. At 11:30, it was 51 taels and nine qian.</p>
<p>The Afternoon Results Return a Small One Tael. In an instant, it returned to 50 taels and six or seven qian. Small households sold off. Then, day traders bought to cover their positions, so the market closed at 51 taels and eight qian at noon, then decreasing again to around 51 taels. Compared to the previous day, it had fallen by one tael (according to the official price). The maximum price during the half-day was 55 taels and eight qian, and the minimum price was 48 taels and a half, a difference of seven taels and three qian.</p>
<p>Red Bars are Obstructed, and Sales Prices Decline. Early market price for goods was 51 taels and two qian, up 1.5 taels at noon. The posted price was changed to 798 taels and six qian, a decrease of 45 to 50 taels. The market closed at 47 taels at noon, with ledger entries at 50 to 51 taels and water top-ups at 50 taels. Due to transportation obstructions from Tianjin, Dalian, and other banks, spot red bars were temporarily halted in sales, causing prices to decline, only adding 11 taels. Yingfeng Heng had received 5,000 taels and sold several hundred taels to the Hankou banks.</p>
<p>Different Exchanges Have Different Trading Targets. The trading targets of various exchanges are different. Statistics show that Da De Cheng, Yuanxing Yong, Fuxing Yong, Xie Xing Yong, Fuyu, and others all bought in. Cuichang Yong, Fuchang, Yuanheng, Hengyu, Hengxing Yuan, Futai Heng, and others bought and then sold. Yuanmao Yong, Shunli, Zhifeng Yong, Wanxing, Yuantai, Yuancheng, Tongtaichang, and Tongfeng Heng all sold. Yifeng Yong sold early and then bought. Daxing Yong, Yuanchun, Fushun, Senchang Yong, Taifengcheng, Yongde, and others bought and sold intermittently. Mr. Wu continued to sell. The Dalian banks sold a total of 3,500 to 3,600 bars and only bought 500 to 600 bars. The Guangdong banks had no transactions.</p>

The noon closing was similar to the previous evening, but the gold market had 7 taels of external twists and turns, ultimately resulting in a loss. However, trading in the gold industry remained active, mainly bundling shillings to swap out notes, with transactions of over 100,000 pounds. There were also purchases of tens of thousands of pounds. There were no significant transactions in U.S. and Japanese currencies. It is customary for there to be no market on Saturday afternoons.</p>

<p>Yesterday was Saturday, and banks were only open for half a day as usual. In the afternoon, trading was closed as usual, so the market atmosphere was very simple. The exchange rates were mostly calm as usual, and the collection and settlement news was also quite slow. There were no important records of auxiliary currencies to be announced.</p>

Therefore, the amount collected and settled on the day was very small. Chinese merchants settled 1.7 to 1.8 million taels of bills, foreign merchants settled over 1.5 million taels, and various goods, exchange taxes, and miscellaneous items settled 7.2 to 7.3 million taels, with 700,000 taels withdrawn from the warehouse.

<h3 id="e176">Securities: Consolidated Tax Bonds Fall by Six to Seven Cents <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, spot transactions of various bonds were extremely scarce, while the futures market continued to decline slightly. Buyer sentiment was slightly active, and the volume of transactions for various bonds was smoother than the previous day. Front-month and back-month bonds were opened across the board. Looking at the trend of market prices for various government bonds, when trading opened in the morning, there was a flurry of selling, although buying was also not deserted, but bond prices hovered downwards, but the trend was stable, and the moderate situation was no different from before. As a result, the 20-year customs duty bond fell by about 8 cents compared to the previous day, and the 20-volume bond and consolidated tax bond also fell by about 6 cents. Other bonds continued to fall by several cents. In addition, there has been no market for 20-volume spot bonds for a long time. Yesterday's price was 2 yuan higher than the middle of last month. It is heard that the reason why bond prices have often tended to weaken in recent days is that some parties are still selling them one after another. It is estimated that spot transactions yesterday were only 2,000 yuan, and futures transactions were over 16.6 million yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e177">Yarn and Cotton Market Still Difficult to Be Optimistic <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is showing a fluctuating pattern again, which is expected after a large drop. However, the overall situation remains weak and sluggish. The severe flooding in various regions has greatly reduced purchasing power, business is sluggish, and all routes are completely stagnant. People are increasingly softening, and large households are still selling, putting heavy pressure on the market. In short, the situation in the world cotton industry is still difficult to be optimistic about. However, the bulls hope that the gold market will rise again. Unfortunately, natural and man-made disasters are coming one after another, and autumn sales will inevitably be reduced. The future depends on actual demand.</p>
<p>Slight Shortage of Bidders, Exchange Bidding Market Opens: The exchange bidding market opened, and the sentiment was slightly firm due to the stability of American cotton. There was a slight shortage of sellers in the market, and prices for all months rose by 2, 3, 5, and 6 cents. The afternoon market was flat, and some large households sold, causing near-term prices to fall by 2 cents and far-term prices to rise by 1 or 2 cents. The total transaction volume was 26,300 bales. It was found that 1,750 bales were sold by Ruida, 1,950 bales by Yichang, 450 bales by Mingde, 400 bales by Gongtai, 400 bales by Xiesheng, and 400 bales by Shenxin. 1,350 bales were bought by No. 20, 600 bales by Shengtai, 950 bales by Yida, and 550 bales by Dafu. The closing prices of the exchange bidding market are recorded on the left.</p>
<p>Exchange Bidding Closing Prices, Change, Inventory: Closing Price, Change, Inventory</p>
<p>August: 159.3, Up 3, 50,900; November: 159.5, Up 4, 91,000</p>
<p>September: 156.5, Up 4, 93,200; December: 158.8, Up 3, 79,650</p>
<p>October: 157.5, Up 5, 92,550; January: 159.2, ..., 38,500</p>
<p>Spot Sales Plummet: Spot yarn business is unusually sluggish. It is found that the total number of bales bought by various groups throughout the day was 420, including 210 bales bought by colleagues. The market is flat and tired. Customer groups bought 260 bales from the mainland, 60 bales from Guangdong, 45 bales from Tianjin and Huai, and 55 bales from miscellaneous groups.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Cotton Market Turns Stable <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>The U.S. cotton forecast report estimates production at 13,943,000 bales. Most people in this port anticipate that it will have upward momentum, so the market sentiment is relatively stable, and there are more buyers. The market sentiment is firm and rising, and some people are concerned that the flooding in all directions is becoming more serious, causing damage to cotton fields, and the weather is becoming more unfavorable. There is concern about the possibility of disturbances. The whole city has news of rising prices, so more people are increasing their purchases. However, the overall global situation and the past consumption of U.S. cotton have not escaped the dire situation, so the large households are still shorting, and the outlook is still mostly bearish.</p>
<p>Han Standard Retail Investors Cover Short Positions and Prices Rebound: The exchange Han Standard market opened in the morning, and the market sentiment was firmer due to the stability of U.S. cotton and the rise in gold prices, causing retail investors to cover their short positions. Prices for all months rose by 1.5 to 2 cents. The afternoon sentiment remained flat, and prices for all months rose by another 0.5 to 1 cent. The total transaction volume was 82,600 dan. It was found that 2,100 dan were sold by Yuande, 2,600 dan by Zhenda, 2,000 dan by Yiyu, 3,000 dan by Yuanda, 3,200 dan by Xinfeng, 1,800 dan by Xiesheng, and 1,600 dan by Dafu. 3,100 dan were bought by Tianlong, 4,900 dan by Guangfeng, 1,800 dan by Changfeng, 3,300 dan by Xincheng, 2,900 dan by Xinheng, 2,000 dan by Xinfeng, and 2,600 dan by Taishengkang.

<p>South City: No ships from various groups arrived, the amount in the warehouse is also scarce, retail sales in urban and rural stores are sluggish, and foreign rice has risen to nearly one yuan, causing public panic. The price of thick japonica rice has risen sharply by 60 to 70 cents. The sales of thin indica rice on this street are slightly better, causing the price to continue to rise by about 50 cents. Luxiang pointed rice is scarce and dry, and the market price has followed up by 20 to 30 cents. Yinhua Yuantong has become a broken chain, and sales are tight again. Foreign rice is still sporadic, and re-exports are particularly active. The market shape is showing a surprising peak due to the high production price.</p>
<p>New Gate: Yesterday, the Social Bureau publicly evaluated prices in the Cuixiutang public office in the City God Temple, and all prices in Hexia were opened. Traders are unwilling to open the market due to capital losses. However, the public association did not open Changxi and Beigeng rice and thin indica rice due to the small price limit, but the merchants directly opened prices, and there were also transactions. The unified market opening was limited, and the prices of various goods were stabilized.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Wheat Prices Rise, Flour Market Soars <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market suddenly soared due to the surge in wheat prices by 70 to 90 cents. There was also a telegram about the United States dumping wheat to Germany. Generally, people speculate that if U.S. wheat is shipped to Europe, the quantity coming to China will inevitably decrease. Domestic floods are frequent, and rice prices are also rising, so it stimulated people's hearts and they rushed to buy. Moreover, the various groups in the Yangtze River in the interior have always been bullish. With this opportunity, they inevitably raised prices. The highest prices in each month were more than 30 cents higher than the previous day. Later, due to the release of goods from Tianjin, the amount was not small, and it was reported that there was a fixed price for foreign flour there, with a straight price of 3 taels, 1 qian, and 6 fen, so the sentiment slightly calmed down. As a result, the price for the current month rose by 17.5 cents compared to the previous day, the price for September rose by 25 cents, the price for October and November rose by 22.5 cents, and the price for December and January rose by 20 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Wheat Price Soars by Over 10 Cents <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market suddenly showed a soaring trend because foreign wheat prices soared by a huge 70, 80, or 90 cents. It was rumored that U.S. wheat was being shipped to Europe, and it was about to become a reality, so everyone suspected that future wheat orders would be hopeless. With the continuous disasters in the country, domestic wheat prices must be expensive, so buying was unusually active, and market prices soared. Although factories were still selling, it was like a drop in the bucket and did not help. As a result, the price for the current month rose by 70 cents compared to the previous day, the price for September rose by 80 cents, the price for October and November rose by 90 cents, and the price for December rose by a huge 100 cents. In the spot wheat market, the sentiment has become strong due to the surge in standard wheat. High-quality goods have already opened at 80 cents, and even lower quality goods are above 60 cents. The future looks promising. It is said that more than 3,000 bales of Kunshan, Taicang, Shuangfeng, Zhitang, and Penglai wheat were opened and handled by Fuxin Huafeng.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Silk and Tea: High-Quality Meizhi Green Tea Prices Continue to Rise <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the upward trend of high-quality Meizhi green tea from Wuyuan, Tunxi, and other routes did not stop slightly. Currently, the sources from the road and estates are only 120,000 to 130,000 boxes. The number of groups that have not yet arrived in Shanghai is only 40,000 to 50,000 boxes. The reduction in the number of boxes of foreign tea has been seen by Chinese and foreign merchants. As a result, Harmony, Jardine, and other companies with large sales have become more interested in purchasing. Chinese merchants are also taking the opportunity to hoard the tea in their hands. Yesterday, the Tianxiang Foreign Company opened at 180 taels for high-quality Meizhi from Beixiang, Wuyuan, which was more than 10 taels higher than before. Other high-quality green teas such as Zhenmei, Fengmei, and Gongxi have also risen across the board.</p>

<p>The Xiamen tangerine peel candy that arrived the day before yesterday was sampled yesterday. The quality of the goods varied slightly. They were opened immediately, with the higher quality ones opening at 21 taels and 8 qian, and the lower quality ones at 21 taels and 6 qian, which was 8 qian higher than the previous round. The factory's output is also low, and the color is brighter, so the market price is also higher.</p>

<p>Yesterday, sugar market production area telegrams reported that the current price of Cuban sugar was unchanged, and the prices of New York sugar futures for September and December each rose by 2 points, while the prices for March and May of next year also rose by 1 point. Java's current and forward sugar prices fluctuated. The Association market chartered plates was very quiet due to Saturday. Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar was still priced at 11 taels and 4 qian, with few buyers. No. 20 medium granulated white sugar was priced at 10 taels and 9 qian, and high-quality goods were priced at 10 taels and 9 qian and 5 fen, with a firm trend. Taikoo sugar spot prices moved slightly due to the needs of various groups, and the market rose again. B was priced at 11 taels and 9 qian and 5 fen, CW was priced at 11 taels and 8 qian and 2 fen and 5 li, DY was priced at 11 taels and 7 qian and 5 fen to 8 qian, HX was priced at 11 taels and 7 qian, and HM was priced at 11 taels and 2 qian and 5 fen.

The market sentiment was very popular, and the entire quantity was sold, showing a situation of insufficient supply.</p>

<p>Market Overview: Yesterday's hardware transactions showed no progress. Although there were large transactions for one or two types of goods, the overall market still felt sluggish. The standards of various goods were oppressed by the adverse external environment, showing a strong exterior but weak interior. Moreover, the arrival of goods was still enthusiastic, but the sales channels were not wide, and the inventory was not large, making it difficult to be optimistic about the market.</p>
<p>One Hundred Tons of Purple Copper Shipped in Batches: Yesterday, the Ordnance Department telegraphed to purchase 100 tons of TC purple copper at a price of 46 taels and 5 qian. It is said that it will be shipped in batches to various places in Jinghan and Shanghai today and tomorrow. However, the local market goods have shown a thriving trend since the acquisition.</p>
<p>Tianjin Groups Restart Purchasing Hardware: The Tianjin resident Zhuang customers in Shanghai received telegrams from their local headquarters two days ago, ordering them to purchase various hardware goods. The reason for the purchase is that the Shi Yousan case is about to be resolved, and autumn is approaching, so there may be a glimmer of hope for the business future, so they are restarting purchasing. The goods purchased yesterday included 380 boxes of tinplate, priced at 14 taels; 150 bars of blue lead, priced at 16 taels; 200 dan of 18-sheet black iron sheets, priced at 11 taels; 400 to 500 pieces of 0.575 British steel plates, with unspecified prices; 20 tons of purple copper, priced at 46 taels and 5 qian. There were also purchases of corrugated iron, plain white iron, and white lead sheets, but the amount was small, so they are omitted.</p>
