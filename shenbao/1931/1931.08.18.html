<p>漢口危急内河試航</p>
<p>此次大水爲災被害逹十六省之多而長江與運河爲尤甚漢口方面已成全巿淹入水中巿　毁滅運輸全阻而滬上内河小輪則一部已可復航兹將記者昨日所得之情形分誌如後</p>
<h3 id="c56">漢巿淹没運輸阻斷 <a href="#c56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>貨棧盡没昨日本埠各輪局接漢口急電言此數日江水大漲已超過五十五尺六寸漢口全巿完全淹在大水中各輪公司碼頭貨棧第一層已經淹去各公司之辦事人員均遷頂層而往來全用船渡低淺之貨棧淹水逹十五尺貨件飄流損失不勝數計怡和太古等各外輪已在碼頭上特造天橋由船際直逹到棧房之二三層供貨物起卸可以越過巿中之大水</p>
<p>建築木塔招商局昨接漢電言沿碼頭水深處逹丈餘兹經分局長李雲良購買巨木一萬餘千元在埠棧前面造建一木塔蓋預防江水再漲在木塔上貫以大挑則輪到時一端逹棧之上層一端逹船面使上下貨可以渡水入棧刻下日夕赶造即可以實用便利上下貨客</p>
<p>宿舍没去昨得確息在漢口怡和洋行各職員所居之宿舍房屋兩所已經不見影踪蓋全淹水内而漢口公園内亦僅有大樹之頂尙透露水面建築物則早無痕跡矣</p>
<p>備輪急用漢口之太古·怡和·日渭·捷江·祥泰·等各外輪公司下層辦事處均已淹没都遷入二樓三樓辦事但江水尙在續漲各公司恐其再有漫起自十五日起已各調空江輪一艘停在碼頭備急要時各職員入輪離渡招商局昨亦急電上海命將江大輪開往以供急難時局員入船避難之用</p>
<p>來貨全斷平漢路來貨早斷宜昌及四川河貨亦以大水所阻不能上船湖南僅有少數貨轉船進口貨幾於全斷惟漢口被災難民連日受水勢續漲逃難至下游者有數千名近日華商各江輪由漢開出多爲難民塞滿無錢購票船員驅之不散到贛皖上陸者最多來滬者較少各輪買辦損失極大但亦無可如何也</p>

<p>滬杭試駛申杭一綫因沿途橋多水高船難通過亦已停業近日據報水勢略退招商戴生昌老公茂議定自今天起派定恒順·恒勝·源發·源吉·等船姑且由滬開出作爲試航班俟沿路無阻再定期正式通航</p>
<p>申湖議開申湖共有六家輪局分早夜兩次亦停駛已久邇日聞湖州之天地元黃四圩盡行淹没在黎里一帶水已略退六公司决定在此兩日之内早夜各班輪全數復業已先派員乘民船至各處勘察準備通航</p>
<p>菱嘉開行申菱班一路據報已可勉强行船招商局即派新安輪前往開班矣而嘉湖一路水勢亦稍落昨亦命承泰輪開航至於申錫班輪今仍用輪航聯行一方至崑山一方到氽河中間派船接送</p>
<p>餘路不通申常班水勢不退據各局言至快須兩禮拜後方能開航鎭揚班水勢只有暗漲此一路至早要九月内方能復業内河輪三十餘綫今祗先開蘇杭湖嘉菱各路也</p>

<p>主賓均有懇墊演說</p>
<p>巿商會於昨日中午十二時在該會常會室歡宴美國勞斯安極立司商會旅行團到郭秉安·郭秉文·王曉籟·林康侯·徐新六·等中外來賓五十餘人王曉籟主席席間由王氏致演說辭次旅行團代表答詞散會後復由商會委員陪同參觀該會商品陳列所及國貨商場採購國貨甚多兹錄演詞如下</p>
<p>巿商會歡迎詞略謂中美兩國通商歷史雖有八九十年之久然而兩國地大物博人民繁庶而往昔交通又不甚便故兩國國民除相互經商於所在國者以外其他接觸之機會殊少美國人士欲明悉中國情形祗有從書籍雜誌中考求惟此種書籍雜誌之著作者其自身旣未必眞確明瞭中國之情形况其中或則業已事過情遷或則係囿於局部而不足以代表全體是以美國人士對於中國情形有眞切之瞭解者殊不多觀以有八十餘年國交之老友而後此情形猶在若明若昧之域詎非可惜故敝會意見以爲欲袪彼此之隔閡宜有相互不斷之視察旅行而此次視察旅行尤以有較長之時間爲相宜蓋視察愈久則彼此情形尤易澈底明瞭較之怱怱一過其收效自不可同日語也聞旅行團在滬將選購中國産物以爲此行紀念敝會以爲此層實有重大意義蓋中美八十餘年友好之基礎全築於「祇圖通商不含有其他目的」之上故旅行團選購敝國産物以爲旅行之紀念最足以表明兩國所以能永久親善之眞意義又一方可表明中國近來工業逐漸進步之實况旅行團歸而携贈親友更可使美國人民互相傳述瞭解中國年來對於工商實業確在平和建設之中使兩國人民國交心理更得築一新的基</p>

<p>礎並可以此行結果使美國人民對於所需要而中國已能供給之物品咸有深刻之印象共同努力於關稅政策之改良使中國之製造者與美國之消費者均得有滿意之結果胥維旅行團一行之賜云云</p>
<p>美旅行團答詞略謂今日中美兩國人士能會集於一堂實一大幸事同時復感謝貴會之盛饌及厚意招待鄙人代表勞斯安極立商界旅行團及美國加州南部諸商界到遠東來考察商業及觀光其目的在想擴充加州南部與東方間之商業航業此次觀光尙不算數將來恐尙有其他觀光團仍將接踵而來希望貴國亦時到敝國考察前美總統盧斯福曾言世界共有三大時期一爲地中海時期現已成爲過去之時期二爲大西洋時期現已將近末期三爲太平洋時期現正在盛興而一九一五年大來氏在美之演說亦謂太平洋之興盛時期已到鄙人因此認爲中國與太平洋之發展大有貢獻明年五月間第一個星期美國全國商業協會將在檀香山舉行大會討論太平洋沿岸之一切商業問題此問題之解决即爲數年與數千年太平洋新局面之實現深望貴國能加入將貴國所要討論者及所希望者屆時提出并望於一九三二年開會之萬國運動大會中國能多派健兒參加云云</p>

<p>彼邦研究中國文化興倍於昔</p>
<p>此來負有溝通兩國文化責任</p>
<p>美人望我肅淸内亂早定憲法</p>
<p>歸途曾著世界不景氣之福音</p>
<p>江亢虎博士於民國十六年間受美國政府之聘擔任國會圖書館顧問辦理東方文化事務嗣又任爲加拿大麥基大學中國學院院長此次返國與我國政府當局有所接洽新聲社記者昨晤江氏於旅次蒙表示各節如下</p>
<p>在美生活江氏在美國四年專事研究中國文化上之優點及其物質盡量向該國宣傳努力以來極得美國上下人士之贊美且自著中國文化史後加拿大學特設中國學院聘江氏爲院長擔任講授東方哲學我國人最近期間在歐美各國大學擔任正敎授者實惟江氏一人而已此外尙譯有我國唐詩三百首一書當譯成時並有英美著名詩家略具考正故該書出版後銷數已在五千册以上英日等國之採購者亦屬不少現該書在上海南京路别發書店亦有出售江氏平日除講授及著作外各方之邀請公開演講者每年當在五十次以上據江氏表示美國人之研究中國文化者日以加多其興趣之濃厚亦較前倍增</p>
<p>返國任務此次返國一方因旅外已久對於國内情形諸多隔閡雖平日亦須於報章見之但多失實遲緩甚少正確消息故擬乘機返國一瞻國内狀况以便將來在美宣傳時有所根據同時對於親舊故友及留平眷屬久别之後亦擬一圖把晤以傾積愫一方面因承美國政府之委託欲於中美文化溝通上作進一步之商酌將我國歷代著作於文化史上有關係有價値之流通本而非國内孤本書籍商請我國政府當局及敎育機關許予運美供給美國國家圖書館中作公開之研究此事於美國方面可以得覘我國歷史上光明文化與立國精神而我國五千年之一部光榮文化史亦得於馳揚海外矣</p>
<p>美人對我美國人對於我國平素總希望能全國統一政治上軌道惟我國近幾年來杌隉不安之局面彼邦人士雖多懷疑但亦無惡感至於我僑旅美者對於國内情形有爲彼邦人士所詢及者或於公開演講宣傳時必將美人所隔膜錯解者加以解釋而唯一目標予美人以瞭解我國狀况者即中國現代無論如何皆革命過程上應有的經過但中國舉國上下之目標仍在求中國之自由平等欲求中國之自由平等不得不一致盡力於取消不平等條約故美人現在對於我國之希望第一在肅淸内亂與匪患同時希望能産一健全之憲法</p>
<p>世界趨勢江氏於此次途中著就一文長約三千餘言題曰世界不景氣之福音内容大意略謂以前資本家之氣勢完全爲交易所之賣空買空結果必歸失敗現在世界之不景氣即資本主義破産之末日譬如美國號稱富國但金錢一物在不流通時亦祇能變爲礦質故美國自鬧成不景氣後欵項之存入銀行者不但毫無利息而且每年須納手續費同時因不景氣而淘汰之失業者反無所依靠於是社會安寗亦必因此大受影響美國如是各國亦如是情勢所迫美國之生活程度遂不得不降低據予所知美日兩國均已降低四分之一而風潮所趨將來資本主義倒後必實行社會主義無疑蓋資本主義猶飛機之在空中無論如何耐久終非降落不可但現在世界不景氣之狀態已步入社會主義必由之階段故余謂乃世界不景氣之福音云</p>

<p>此會旣爲私人團體之組織故其目的與國際間各種負有正式使命之組織完全不同兹約略舉述之如（一）指派專門家負實地研究之責欲因此種研究之成績以期其他之太平洋問題亦得引起賡續不斷之研究（二）研究所得之結果或爲論文或爲報吿印出之後彼此互換迨至成熟之時始以之爲計論各問題之基礎（三）討論之後雖不能求得解决之决議然此種討論之經過及各專家之研究可以梓行於世使一般讀之者明瞭此問題之内容則正確之輿論即可藉之産生且惟因無决議之形式故討論易致詳盡不受拘束（四）事實方面旣研究明晰討論詳盡各國際間及種族間之問題自可藉之以促進彼此之相互諒解</p>
<p>以上所述就其性質及目的言之耳嘗慨吾國人對於世界大勢之變遷國際政治經濟之狀况漠不關心即國内之産業如何寶藏多少以及其他政治經濟各重要問題除少數知其梗槪者外亦多茫然無知故數十年來每遇内政外交重大事件恒苦無可靠之資料以定解决之方針率爾爲之往往貽誤要機且吾國各種重要之問題與外國有關者率因缺乏宣傳之故事實眞相不明於世界遂致其他外人對於此項問題因惑於片面之言致不能有正確之輿論事實具在皆國人所耳熟也今有一國際間之學術組織太平洋國際學會以研究爲討論各種問題之依據各國實業界及學術界之加入者自必能舉其困苦及其研究之所得直切揭布俾外人一明其實况雖無解决之可言然此種專家所披露之意見殊有暗示各國政府應取方針之可能也按第二屆大會之時英國代表與中國代表披瀝肝胆交換意見其後英國政策因之改善即第三次在西京開會對於東三省問題論戰甚烈結果促醒日本人民以大連已爲己有之迷夢此種組織就實際言不第足以促進吾國人明悉國外之情形且足使吾國之社會經濟文化各現狀及與外國有關之各重要問題得使外人洞悉其藴實屬有利而無弊似無可厚非也</p>
<p>第四屆太平洋國際學會之會議自一九二九年在日本西京召集第三次會議時即由吾國代表邀請來華舉行邇來對於各方面業已積極籌備此次會議討論之内容分主要及專門兩類屬主要者爲（一）太平洋之國際經濟關係（二）中國之國際關係屬專門者爲（一）食糧及人口問題（二）太平洋非獨立民族之政治社會經濟問題（三）文化問題（四）移民及種族問題（五）勞工問題與生活程度要其中所討論者皆爲今日太平洋之主要問題集各國之專門人材於一堂對於彼此相關聯之問題詳悉討論以供此後解决此種問題者之决擇其目的至明著要非可訾議也且根據總理之學說行之非艱知之維艱中國今日經濟社會之問題繁頣如麻其能澈底研究洞悉癥結者甚屬寥寥此次大會對於吾國各問題討論之結果必有足供考鏡之資他山之助者利而用之豈得云無補耶</p>

<p>事業之成敗。不足以論英雄。面貌之美醜。不足以衡美人。</p>
<p>作事多遇困難者。才得有實經騐。戀愛經過波瀾者。乃見有眞愛情</p>
<p>處世职渡河。遇着狂風巨浪。固應小心翼翼即風平浪靜。也當競競業業。</p>
<p>在夢中去尋歡樂。不如在現實裏努力人生。</p>
<p>愛無條件。的是欺人之語。情有起因。乃爲正當之辭。</p>
<p>人如能以己之心度人之心。則社會上當可减少許多無謂糾紛</p>
<p>靑年男女。在求愛時可以得到不少意外的聰明。然而在失戀時却增加許多無謂的煩惱。</p>
<p>夢中世界。畢竟是蜃樓海巿。醒後乾坤。才是眞正現實人間</p>
<p>戀愛如作戰。漂亮面孔是計策。榮譽地位是士卒。金錢是糧餉槍械。計策不高明士卒不衆多。固不足以克敵糧餉不豐。槍械不精。尤不足以制勝。</p>
<p>在現代各機關或公司裏。有種極不平等的事實。便是作事多者酬勞必小。作事少者酬勞必大。</p>

<h3 id="c113">有漲無退之首都大水 <a href="#c113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— 雞冠</p>
<p>首都洪水爲災報紙記之者屢矣。近十日間。天雖放晴。氣候炎熱。然江邊一帶。非但水勢未退。且有逐漸漲高之現象。據本京人言。江水不上岸則已。一上岸恒數星期不能退。兹者平地積水。高可没及大股。黃包車行時踏板之上。亦受水浸。若再漲尺許。勢必巿内交通。盡遭阻斷。此殆因上游如漢口九江。一片汪洋汎瀾而下。故首都江流有漲無退也。</p>
<p>昔見滬報所載。謂首都霪雨之時。街衢多成澤國。中山馬路兩旁池塘溢滿。魚類四散因有在馬路上設罟以捕者。此非所語於現在大水之首都。益目下不祗馬路之魚。逃避一空。即江水湍急。漁舟不敢冒險。捕旣不易。價亦增高。巿上魚蝦之屬。已較平時售價。高逾倍蓰矣</p>
<p>尤有一事。在不明首都情形者聞之。難免不引以爲異。首都居民用水。率取自井中。飲水則來自江岸。皆由苦力戽注水車牽挽以行。目今沿江水深數尺下關街道。亦多被淹。若在街頭取水。則車馬往來。而裸足奔走水中者比比皆是。汚濁不潔。難充飲料。至在江邊運送。又因水深載重。拖走異常費力受斯影響。飲水來源。漸見稀少。由是若干老虎竈。均高漲水値。昔之每杓一銅圓者。今竟增至三倍。際此天時尙熱。需水較多之秋。各家因莫不蹙額也。水災以水過量。不意飲水反因街道積水。致成奇貨。斯亦可謂事之奇者已。</p>

<p>蒜豆腐　新大蒜苗切爲末。和小方塊豆腐入鑊後。加蝦米少許。燒一分鐘即止。鮮嫩異常。</p>
<p>紅菱糕　紅菱剝去其殼。切薄片。和藕粉洋菜薄荷白糖。攙匀燒一分鐘取出。待其旣冷。即凝結成糕矣。</p>
<p>栗子酥　栗子去殼。燉得爛熟。再用乾麵。加猪油炒之。拌匀後。放白糖百果少許。揑成爲酥。鬆軟異常。</p>
<p>糖藕粥　藕取糯米實其中。入鑊放糯米袋。紅糖燒之爲粥。香甜可口。</p>
<p>桂圓球　取新鮮桂圓。去殼去核。調之以麵入油鑊内。氽至二面黃即止。甘美絕倫。</p>
<h3 id="c115">慈母口中的羅克 <a href="#c115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>— 墨逸</p>
<p>羅克生長於美國加尼福尼亞州。當我（羅克之母自稱下仿此）發現他有演劇的天才時。還没有影戲這樣東西。所以我想把他造成一個舞台上的名角。而他自己也决定往這條路上走。但没有想到他能有今天這麽一天。他的成功雖然是他有演劇的天才究竟還要歸功於「影戲」假使在舞台上做一個伶人。恐怕不能聞名世界罷。</p>
<p>當他年紀還很小的時候。他和他哥哥蓋勞德兩人便表演些幼稚的玩意兒。在他們算是戲劇的舉動。但有時我又覺着他們怪有意思的。便從旁指導他們一些。等他稍長到學校去讀書。已經有很可觀的成績。他的表演簡直没有一點兒孩子氣了。在學校中他常常參加游藝會。表演些喜劇。就博得好譽。給人家稱贊他是一個有希望的笑匠了。</p>
<p>他到了十六歲的時候。他父親帶着他去看從來没有看過的影戲。這一下可壞了。他自從看了影戲以後。簡直難得在家。總是一天到晚在外邊。也不知道他在外邊幹些什麽勾當。不久。他到影戲公司去做臨時演員的消息便得入我的耳鼓。</p>
<p>一天。導演從一大羣的孩子中間選出他。呌他試試看。他表演得很能使導演滿意。於是他的名字便塡入薪金簿裏。但他的天才還没有給導演發現。只做一個配角。什麽配角都扮演。而且他都能扮演得出神入化。觀衆都說他前程遠大。</p>
<p>他有一種吹毛求疵的脾氣。所以他對於他自己所主演的片子。從來没有滿意過。總想下次再有更好的成績。若有一個人當。面稱贊他表演得很好。他總是這樣回答說。「不見得罷。你以爲這張片子這兒或那兒表演得很好了。但我還不覺得怎樣的好。我想下次或許能有更使你滿意的成績」。</p>
<p>在眼前他雖然名聞全球。但他還是一個簡單的腦筋。熱心工作的。而且完全孩子氣的人。他酷愛運動。家裏闢有十五英畝大的運動塲。其中有九個洞的小哥爾夫球塲。網球和棒球塲並且還有一個大游泳池。他對於運動簡直和拍戲一樣的專心。所以他有很强健的體格。他旣不抽烟。又不喝酒。更奇怪的是他連茶和咖啡都不愛喝。他只歡喜喝冷牛奶。他的家庭裏充滿着快樂的空氣。他對於愛妻的愛情的專一。世界上也罕有其匹。他並且愛他的兩個女兒。一個兒子。和愛他愛妻一樣的愛。</p>
<h3 id="c116">歡送出洋學生大會小紀 <a href="#c116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— 萍</p>
<p>海上各文化團體。昨假西摩路陳家花園歡送本屆出洋學生賓主到百五十餘。該園規模宏敞。我們在濃蔭綠樹中欣賞·游散·談笑·本就逸興横生。兼之有攝影·茶叙·演說·音樂·等等。自然有許多材料。可以紀載。因摘述一二。以博一粲。</p>
<p>小姊妹也會游泳　陳家花園的設備。眞算不錯。有運動塲及家庭游泳池。他們一家老小。都很喜歡運動。我們在未開會以前。包圈在池旁看游泳。有四位小妹妹。是園主陳炳謙的孫女。小的五六歲。大的不過十二三歲。伊們在淸波盪漾中。浮沉自如。各式游泳。都很諳熟。而且能在很高的跳板上縱身入水。可見伊們訓練的一斑。這種家庭體育。我國人大可仿效。</p>
<p>徐佩璜一片婆心　草地上攝影的一幕完了後。依次步入禮堂。來賓中有敎育家。科學家。外交家。經濟家。交際家。濟濟一堂。年齡自十餘歲以至七八十歲的都有。所謂「羣賢畢至少長咸集」。此會彷彿似之。主席徐佩璜。於行禮後致詞。劈頭就說「……回憶一九○九年時出洋留學生。先要剪掉辫子。換上一身西裝。但人家不會來歡送的。只有你自己送自己。家人哭哭啼啼的惜别。不過二十年前後的事。眞差得太遠了。他希望留學生在外要細察歐美物質文明的精華。和實事求是。勇往邁進的精神。帶回祖國來應用。倘如學他們奢靡的習氣。如跳舞場的華麗。和上海大東。大滬來比較優劣。那就走上錯路了」。</p>
<p>呉經熊海外艶遇　有人稱呉先生爲洋博士。但這次他一篇偉論。却很推崇詩書禮樂。及中國古代學術的昌盛。他說「譬如歐美的新聞事業和輿論權威。到現代才覺得偉大。在中國則數千年前孔老夫子删詩書修春秋。他便是元始的新聞記者。西洋人聰明才智。那裏趕得上我們中國人。所以不要自餒」。他又自己說「老夫耄矣。於國家大事無能爲力。願諸君好自爲之」。其實呉先生只三十餘歲。壯年有爲。怎能稱老。末了他報吿以前在歐美的韻事說。「某年在美。一般靑年以燙髮爲時髦。我也常去燙髮。除非身畔没有錢。否則跳舞。嫖娼什麽都想去嘗試。尤其到巴黎去的。要避免色慾的引誘。有一次我在巴黎某戲院。見一位妙齡女郎。伊給我幾次熱愛的暗示。開始伊引誘的工作。我不客氣的拒絕伊說。「我已經結過婚。不能愛你了」。伊從容的回答。「結了婚。也没甚關係的呀」。像這般淫蕩的社會。應付眞不容易。呉氏東拉西凑。妙語横生。操上海口音。雜以寗波土話。及國語。英語。座客笑不可仰。</p>
<p>呉宗濂席間趣語　外交界先輩前駐意公使七十七叟呉宗濂氏。也扶杖而來。老人意興甚濃。氣體亦健。但兩耳失聰。在靜寂寂的會場中。他發出幾句高聲的趣語。當呉經熊演說時。他問「是誰」。有書「呉經熊」以對。他說「哦。他便是呉經熊。年紀這麽輕。還說什麽老」。又說。「呉君一篇風流史。倒爲報紙平添不少好材料哩」。因爲他聲音宏亮。座客一陣笑聲。打破了沉寂的空氣。有人說他老人聽得很淸爽。耳朶並不壞呢。</p>
<p>羅遲慧說要做賊　主席爲適應羣衆心理的要求。宣吿每人演說畢。雜以音樂以助興。李獻敏女士及光迪夫人的鋼琴。陳植君的獨唱。戴粹倫君的梵啞鈴極得聽衆讚美。次留學生代表致答詞。留歐爲羅遲慧女士。留美爲林詩伯君。羅女士說。「我們到了外國要有做賊偷東西的本領」。或以爲說這不道德的行爲。是何用意。伊接着又說。「除在書本用功夫外。要把他們科學上秘密的東西。用巧妙的方法去偷學……」。大家才明白這過人的見解七時會畢盡興而散。</p>

<p>— 姚蘇鳳</p>
<p>一切都說了個明白，丁小姐才明瞭陸先生實在是一個没有良心的騙子，他騙了他自己，騙了他父母，騙了他妻子，又騙了伊。只恨自己當初不曾看得淸楚，却憑着他一時假意的慇懃，就以爲他是個可托終身的好男子，遂致受了莫大了冤屈，想起了怎得不悔恨交集呢？</p>
<p>小榮的妻子聽得丁小姐把過去的事吿訴了伊，也着實替丁小姐可惜，兩個人談談說說，雖然各人都自怨自艾，有時歎息，有時出眼涙，却很話得投機，一些也不互相仇恨。</p>
<p>「你一個人人地生疏的到上海來，今天就住在我這裏吧，停一回，他一定會得來的，那時再質問他吧！」丁小姐一面就吩咐秋子去安排一隻床舖，好讓小榮的妻子住下，一面叮囑秋子，千萬不要吿訴給老太太知道，免得伊老人家生氣。可是自己想想，又不禁一陣陣的心酸。</p>
<p>這時，突然地下起大雨來，在雷電交作中，門鈴響起來了。</p>
<p>秋子正在樓上安排被褥，一聽得門鈴響了，就推開前面的小窗一看却，是陸先生回來了。立刻就跑下樓來，吿訴丁小组。</p>
<p>丁小姐一聽得秋子說是陸先生回來，心頭的火直冒了起來，但是轉念一想，覺得他這樣的一進來就把事情拆穿了，不免要老羞成怒，也許反惹了禍端，張揚出去，更不好聽因此丁小姐就關照小榮的妻子，呌伊暫且在樓上自己的房間的後一間裏等一會，又千萬叮囑着伊看見了小榮之後，不要立刻就出來和他吵鬧，以便相機行事。</p>
<p>小榮的妻子已經很信仰丁小姐了，就聽了伊的話，由秋子領上樓去，藏在丁小姐的後房。一面丁小姐就自己去開門，讓小榮進來。</p>
<p>「怎麽這許多時候才未開門？雨眞大，衣裳也弄得濕了！」陸先生帶着笑說。丁小姐也不回答他，自顧走上樓去，陸先生跟在後面，一同走到了臥室裏。</p>
<p>陸先生一邊把衣卸了，一邊坐了下來，看見丁小姐臉上的神色很不好看，而且一句話也不說，心裏自然有些奇怪他就問··「怎麽你今天的臉色很不好看？說話也没有呢？」</p>
<p>「我病了」丁小姐簡捷地回答。</p>
<p>「病了得請醫生啊！」陸先生依然是很慇懃。</p>
<p>「不用請醫生，我想你應該知道我的病因！」丁小姐說話的時候聲音也發顫了。</p>

<p>— 珂</p>
<p>每天殘陽西落夜幕初張的時候我便忙忙的把翻亂了的書本檢好帶着一種幽閑的情緒立在靠街的樓窗前眺望細細地呑嚥那美麗的晚霞瞬息變幻的雲影這時遠遠地總會有一陣很熟悉的胡琴聲吚吚呀呀地響到弄堂裏來當她奏着那飄泊的悲苦的音調走過我的窗下不期然地會引起我心絃上的震動發出一種淒凉的異鄉感觸</p>
<p>經過整天的熱悶天空裏漸漸地佈起了白雲越聚越多頓時變成灰色的蒼穹低垂着的梧桐樹葉被風吹得簸簸地發響蜻蜓成夥地圍繞着樹蔭飛舞樹下嘈嘈雜雜的小孩嘻笑和大人說話這時斷斷續續的胡琴聲又飄進了弄堂走過窗下轉到屋後的狹弄裏又倐然轉回來在梧桐的樹底下突然地停住了似乎是緊了緊絃索接着便節奏的奏起來夾着沙破的女人謳歌聲</p>
<p>我坐到桌上向下面一望「嚇」樹底下那麽的人大人小人站的坐的圓圓地圍了一個圈圈子中間擺着一條長凳坐着一個四十多歲的女人她的頭髮長長地披到衣領下面皮黃瘦肩膀高聳她一面拉着胡琴一面開合着闊大的嘴唇發出一種破銅般的音調雖然她唱的是怎樣地難聽而不能喚起人的快感但圍攏聽着的人們都顯現得那麽興奮那麽欣然那麽驕傲地尤其是對門李家的奶媽她撻着肥碩的肚皮常常地用手拍着抱在她懷裏的一個白胖小孩的肥蹄般的大腿眼睛笑得和彌勒佛般</p>
<p>「小妹妹你幾歲了喜歡聽曲子吧」那女人唱完了把胡琴斜靠在身上順手拉着站在她面前的一個女孩間那個女孩笑着點了點頭在衣袋裏掏出幾個銅板給她</p>
<p>「呵謝謝小妹妹眞懂事哩」她滿堆着縐紋的臉上現出一種不自然的謟笑又聳了聳肩膀望着大家說</p>
<p>於是他們裏面有幾個人也拿了些錢給她</p>
<p>「喂你這樣每天可以賺多少錢哩」一個戴着眼鏡在縫衣服的女人間</p>
<p>「唉有時白飯也混不到呵」她扭着頸脖微微地嘆了一口氣</p>

<p>「那末你爲什麽要這樣做呢像我們的事不更可靠些嗎」我家的章媽憐憫似的說</p>
<p>「是的不過有誰要用我呢我是這麽的瘦弱呵」她用手帕揉擦眼睛擦得眼眶紅紅地說道「我現在是什麽事都不能做常常地氣喘咳嗽——以前也有過好日子的但如今是什麽也没有了只是一個街上的討飯</p>
<p>「以前也有過好日子嗎是怎麽的一回事啊」大家都驚奇地問似乎這是一個有趣味的故事一樣她看了他們一眼略略地躊蹰了一下蹙着眉毛說道「說起來眞……」她又自己反駁道「這又算什麽呢誰又在小的時候能夠支配自己的命運呢」她於見開始述說她的歷史她說</p>
<p>「我在八歲的那年家鄉正鬧着飢荒我的爸媽挨不住整日整夜的飢餓便帶</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>着我逃到江南來那時我對於這從不曾見過的繁華美麗是怎樣地驚奇羡慕啊我什麽也不知道只是成天的跟着爸媽在街頭巷尾流浪着有那麽一回那麽一個賊頭賊腦的不認識的男人他不知和爸爸說了些什麽便硬拖我去一個地方我似乎知道這於我没有好處儘是哭嚷—媽也好像在流涙—但這都没有用終於被他送到個人家去」</p>
<p>「呵是公館裏嗎是堂子裏嗎」李家的奶媽問</p>
<p>「你猜想吧」她笑了笑接着說下去</p>
<p>我昏昏沉沉地過了兩三年的光景又由人介紹到一家戲院裏去過戲子的生活—我是扮演武旦</p>
<p>「這可不容易哩你會玩那些把戲嗎」站在牆根下的個廚子樣的男人詞</p>
<p>「是的我自小就喜歡弄這些」</p>
<p>「誰敎會你的」李家奶媽說</p>
<p>「没有人敎和鄰居的小孩子們玩會的」</p>
<p>「積德吧老見打斷人家的話」戴眼鏡的女人不耐地聽着</p>
<p>她摸了摸頭髮繼續說道</p>
<p>「有一天這是我幸運走到最後的一天是一個燈紅酒綠的晚上我在一家漂亮的大飯店裏和先生大人們吃酒豁拳我那時因爲多代了幾鍾酒昏沉沉地走出飯店的大門便坐車一直到戲院即晚我演的一曲戲是要在疊着的三張桌子上再疊兩張茶几的上面翻筋斗躍下來我上了台玩過幾套刀槍之後雖然覺得有些眼花頭暈但是終於照例地爬上了最高的頂點雙手支住腰部頭部往背後一灣……這一瞬間我立刻明白了自己的危險眼前黑暗頭腦沉重突然的一聲巨響面前發出無數的火星來便什麽都不知道了」</p>
<p>我醒來是在一個醫院裏了睜開眼睛頓時現得一切都改變了是那麽地模糊黑暗當我淸楚了自己已經成爲殘廢—撞破了一隻眼球—我是怎麽地悲傷哭泣……我恨不得立刻死亡我明白我的容貌毁壞了我的生命也就跟着消滅了」</p>
<p>「唉」她長長地嘆了一口氣「我一隻眼孤零零地走出了醫院誰也不再認識我了我的命連便是這樣地决定永遠地在街上飄流歌唱</p>
<p>「唉、眞可憐啊、」大家都嘆息着、</p>
<p>她默坐了一會懶懶地站起身來打了一個呵欠</p>
<p>這時她的臉正對着我的窗門忽然看見她右邊的眉毛下面凸露着一個血絲網着的白眼球現得非常的可怕</p>
<p>她慢慢地拿起胡琴又摸了摸頭髮向大家說了聲「再會」便吚吚呀呀地拉着走出弄堂去了</p>

<p>Timely Commentary: Donate Money for Disaster Relief</p>
<p>Since the occurrence of the flood disaster, the reporter has been doing their best to appeal to the nation, offering both temporary and permanent solutions for relief. This has been done ten times already. Currently in Shanghai, organizations such as the "Various Provinces Flood Disaster Relief Committee" have been established, and the national government has also set up the "Flood Disaster Relief Committee". This signifies that our nation and its people have seriously taken note of this unprecedented catastrophe of the century and are determined to actively provide relief. However, more than two months have passed since the disaster, and the people awaiting death have only a breath of life left, their cries for help incessant. Worse still, before the floodwaters have receded, new floods have arrived. As the torrents flow eastward, thousands of miles along the Yangtze River will likely suffer a similar fate. Yet, the personnel responsible for emergency relief have not yet departed, and preventative measures have not yet begun. The disaster victims are crying out for help, but they have not received a shred of assistance. Empty words are spoken all day, but nothing is put into practice. How can the drowning victims possibly wait? It is like "hearing the sound of footsteps on the stairs but seeing no one come down." The sole reason for this is the lack of money.</p>
<p>How can money be raised? Many would answer by looking to the government. However, we must also provide practical assistance; we cannot simply sit by and watch, turning a deaf ear to the cries of suffering and refusing to contribute a single hair to benefit the disaster victims. Relief is like fighting a fire: it is a matter of life and death, and there is no time to delay. Those who sit idly by may leisurely observe the situation, while those floating on the water feel that each moment is as long as a year. Therefore, the way to raise emergency funds is still to encourage individuals in society to donate generously. Those with money should donate money, and those without money should offer their assistance.</p>
<p>Regarding the philosophy of donating money, the reporter has already commented on this matter frankly. Donating money is a noble, virtuous, and joyful act that involves broadening one's perspective and recognizing one's best interests. It is an expression of the highest morality, emanating from the depths of one's heart and sincerity, and cannot be forced upon anyone. However, "a rich man's feast requires half a year's worth of food for a poor man." Now, a rich man's feast could save the lives of ten disaster victims. Humans are not made of wood or stone; why can't they be moved to compassion and express their highest morality? Furthermore, if thousands are starving and freezing while I alone enjoy prosperity, hoarding wealth and refusing to use it, what method can I employ to protect myself if the victims, driven by desperation, resort to violence? The potential consequences are clear. Why can't I broaden my perspective, help others, and engage in virtuous and joyful conduct? In short, hoarding money is useless; it only burdens oneself, perhaps even one's descendants. Using it properly is the only way to make it worthwhile. Accumulating it without using it is a form of avarice. Donating what I have accumulated to save people from death is the proper way to use it, and it brings me joy. The reporter sincerely appeals to the nation on behalf of the disaster victims. It is hoped that people will express their highest morality. Those with money should donate money, and those without money should offer their assistance, so that the relief agencies can effectively provide aid. The lives of fifty million disaster victims hang by a thread. The nation must act quickly and not hesitate any longer. Yesterday, Chinese expatriates in Singapore remitted ten thousand yuan to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, and the Pope in Rome also allocated three thousand pounds to assist with emergency relief. Overseas Chinese and foreign friends are deeply concerned and have sent their sympathy from afar. Everyone desires to do good, so why should I not? I refuse to believe that the people of our country, who have witnessed firsthand the suffering of the flood disaster, would refuse to lend a helping hand. I dare not believe it. My beloved compatriots, the reporter earnestly hopes that you will prove my words to be true.</p>
<p>Foreign Important Telegrams:</p>
<p>Five Major British Figures Gather in London to Discuss Financial Issues</p>
<p>The Government Denies Wage Cut Proposals; Temporary Parliament to Convene Soon</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 17th - The five major economic figures, namely MacDonald, Snowden, Henderson, Graham, and Thomas, have all returned to London this morning from various locations and are scheduled to meet at 4 p.m. to discuss political issues. There has been much activity in political circles recently, as it is anticipated that after the Cabinet meeting on the 19th, the government will decide to convene Parliament to pass legislation containing government proposals. There are various rumors regarding the government's proposed plans, but the public's significant collection of various profitable securities, subject to a special tax, is currently under serious consideration.</p>
<p>National News Agency, London, 17th - The London Daily Mail published that the British government will adopt austerity measures to offset the budget deficit of 120 million pounds, with the aim of achieving equal sacrifice from everyone. The measures generally include the following: (1) Halting extravagant road construction plans, saving 6 million pounds; (2) Reducing government subsidies to the British Broadcasting Corporation by 475,000 pounds; (3) Reducing salaries of cabinet members and convening members, with members' salaries reduced to 5,000 pounds per year; (4) Implementing methods to reduce the cost of living and appropriately reducing salaries of civil servants; (5) Reducing teachers' salaries by 10%; (6) Levying a 1% tax on all investment fixed income; (7) Reducing unemployment relief funds by 2 shillings per week. The Daily Mail anticipates that these austerity measures will be approved by the Three-Party Conference, passed by the Cabinet, and submitted to Parliament in September to establish legislation. Prime Minister MacDonald and leaders of various parties have also returned to the capital and will address several matters this week. Financial authorities are seeking ways to offset the budget. The Economic Committee will meet again today and has scheduled a full Cabinet meeting next week to consider the matter. Currently, various austerity plans are being meticulously researched by treasury officials. Finance Minister Snowden has received numerous suggestions from various parties.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 16th - British Prime Minister MacDonald told a Reuters reporter in Lossiemouth today, regarding the rumors that party leaders will issue a declaration requesting voluntary salary cuts, that they are grotesque rumors. He also stated that there has never been a suggestion of a unanimous temporary salary cut across all sectors. He further stated that the country is as solid as the Bank of England and that there is no reason to propose a uniform salary cut. It is expected that the result of the financial discussions among the party leaders will be to select the most outstanding members of the three parties in Parliament to form an economic group. The Cabinet Economic Committee will reconvene at the Prime Minister's residence on Monday and Tuesday to formulate concrete measures to balance the budget and will submit them to the Cabinet meeting on Wednesday. On Thursday, the executive committee of the Trade Union Congress and the national executive committee of the Labor Party will meet to discuss the national financial situation. Conservative Party member Neville Chamberlain and Liberal Party member Samuel will rush back to London to inquire about the government's views. Therefore, Tuesday will be the day when the government makes important decisions. At that time, the government will be able to know the attitude of the opposition parties and its own party members.</p>
<p>Spanish Church United in Opposition to the Constitution</p>
<p>Continued Riots Erupt in Various Regions; Situation Remains Tense</p>
<p>Reuters, Madrid, 16th - The Spanish National Priests' Association has jointly drafted a letter and sent it to various churches, requesting that they unite to fight against the atheism in official circles and denouncing the new Spanish constitution. At the same time, the minority Radical Party has proposed to Parliament that the church be prohibited from selling its assets. The provisions of the new constitution, which will be read in Parliament on Tuesday, have been leaked to the outside world. It is understood that the new constitution abolishes the death penalty, prohibits secret diplomacy, and abolishes the secret funds in the budget.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Madrid, 16th - Serious riots have erupted in Zaragoza, Malaga, and Seville again. The central authorities are considering declaring martial law in these three cities. The situation in the Basque region is also becoming increasingly tense. The Catalan authorities have claimed that they are prepared to handle the situation themselves, while the provisional government insists on sending additional troops to suppress them, thus further complicating the situation.</p>
<p>Reuters, National News Agency, Madrid, 17th - Today, someone placed a bomb in an access hole near the telephone main lines, cutting off part of the capital's telephone service. The force of the explosion was so great that the iron cover of the access hole flew to the roof of a nearby building. Shortly afterward, an industrial revolutionary was arrested for attempting to place a bomb at the entrance of a telephone exchange. Several clashes occurred between striking telephone workers and the security forces in various parts of the city, resulting in several injuries.</p>
<p>The Success or Failure of the Cuban Revolution Depends on the United States</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 16th - According to a dispatch from the Cuban capital, the success or failure of the Cuban revolutionary movement is in the hands of the United States. American banks have significant relationships with Cuba and own numerous sugar cane fields due to mortgages. If the American banks and the State Department do not support the dictatorial system of the current Cuban president, the current Cuban government will be unable to pay military salaries and will eventually be overthrown. Revolutionary party leaders who have been captured are currently imprisoned in the Cabana Fortress. The revolutionary party is said to have transported military supplies from the United States.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Havana, 16th - The Cuban revolutionary army is still strong and continues to fight against the government forces. It has demanded the immediate resignation of the current president. According to former Cuban Ambassador to the United States, Turrin, in Washington, speaking to the Associated Press, although revolutionary army leaders former President Menocal and Colonel Monteith have been captured, the party will continue to fight to the end. Their capture has only spurred the revolutionary operation to greater strength. Turrin is also one of the strongest opponents of the current president.</p>

<p>Reuters, Washington, 17th - The cabinet revenue, including tariffs, in the fiscal year of 1931 fell short by 61.11 million yuan to 242.8 million yuan.</p>
<p>Page 10</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 16th - The temporary prosperity created in the United States by President Hoover's debt deferment plan appears to have vanished. The New York Times index, based on the average percentage of the past five years, shows that the activity of major industries fell to 73.5% last week and has dropped to a new low of 72.5% this week. The same period last year was 86. Cotton cloth production has not decreased compared to last year. It is generally believed that general trade will be difficult to improve until the European situation becomes clear.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<p>Central Party Headquarters and National Government Memorial Week</p>
<p>Chen Lifu Speaks on the Three Principles of the People; Ding Weifen Reports on Disaster Relief and Communist Suppression</p>
<p>On the morning of August 17th, at 9:00 AM, the Central Party Headquarters held a memorial week. Central Committee members Ding Weifen, Chen Lifu, Miao Peicheng, Fang Juehui, Yu Jingtang, and guests from various departments, along with all staff members of the Party Headquarters, totaling over three hundred people, attended. Ding Weifen presided over the meeting and performed the customary rites. Chen Lifu then reported on the reasons for emphasizing the ideological aspect of eliminating the Communist Party. He stated that the armed forces the Communist Party relies on to disrupt peace have been gradually eliminated since Generalissimo Chiang went to the front to supervise the suppression and that they will soon be completely eradicated. However, while the Communist Party's military force may be eliminated, how to change the Communist Party's mindset is a major issue that needs to be studied at present. He believes that those who believe in Communism are mostly young people with unstable knowledge who are extremely convinced of Communism or misled by seemingly plausible doctrines. Therefore, to fundamentally eliminate Communist beliefs, one must first understand what Communism is. Communism is a manifestation of Marxism. To understand Marxism, one must first understand Marx. What kind of person was Marx? Marx was actually a Jew. Jewish thought has a traditional concept, namely gold worship, the so-called selfishness. Before Jesus was born, this kind of thought had already aroused the antipathy of Europeans. Jesus was also a Jew, so after Jesus was born, observing the world situation, he created a new religion and advocated so-called love. However, his Jewish thinking was not thoroughly changed, so it still flowed into capitalism. In modern Europe, the countries that believe in Christianity and adhere to capitalism are still not free from the inherent Jewish thinking. Jews have a constant saying that as long as it does not harm individuals, the country can be ignored, so although the Jewish state has perished, the power of Jews is still all over the world. Marx's theory once said that Communism is easiest to implement in the United States, but the United States was not moved by Marx's words because most of the capitalists in the United States are also Jews. Russia has always been the country most deeply oppressed by Jewish capitalism, so it adopted Marx's theory and thought of overthrowing the Jews. In fact, Marx's theory still cannot get rid of the Jewish selfish concept, so workers resist capital and farmers resist landlords. The state does not have to be combined, and the nation is still derived from the selfish concept, losing its fair way, which is exactly the same as Jesus, and is even more cruel. China has been established for more than 4,000 years, and it is not accidental that it has come to this point. The only thing that can be said briefly is that the power lies in the two words "neutrality". In the Book of Yu, it is said that "hold to the middle with sincerity", and in the Doctrine of the Mean it is said that "the middle is the right way of the world, and neutrality is the established principle of the world". Mencius said that "holding the end and using the middle" has been the foundation of the country for thousands of years. The Three Principles of the People established by the Prime Minister are to examine the morality of the people internally and observe the world trend externally. The four words "the world is for all" are the way to establish a country shown by the Prime Minister, which contains the broadest and most righteous and unbiased principles. There are three kinds of worldism in the world today: (1) Capitalism, (2) Communism, (3) The Three Principles of the People. Capitalism and Communism go to extremes, resulting in a mechanical result of mutual killing. Not leaning to the other side must rely on this side. Only the Three Principles of the People is the most central and righteous, and can integrate capital and Communism in between, so that the world can enjoy peace and harmony. Moreover, the Prime Minister also advocated loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, trustworthiness, righteousness, and peace to show the inherent morality of the Chinese people. In the Three Principles of the People, all intentions are extremely repeatedly exhorted. Therefore, the work of eliminating the Communist armed forces and eliminating Communism should be divided into two levels. The Communist armed forces should be eliminated with revolutionary armed forces, and to eliminate Communism, it is not enough to change its ideology with the Three Principles of the People. There are young people who have come from the Communist Party who say that working in the Communist Party for several years is equal to not knowing what to do. They are unconscious and dreamy, like machines. There are no parents, no wives, no friends in the Communist Party, and they are busy all day without any human interest. This is the real saying of the young people who have left the Communist Party. With the inherent morality of the Chinese people, they can follow the path of the Three Principles of the People. Capitalism and Communism are originally unrelated to China. The Chinese people can embody the Three Principles of the People and preserve their inherent morality, then Capitalism and Communism can collapse without fighting. Therefore, the Communist armed forces have been eliminated, and in terms of ideology, they can only change their thoughts to practice the Three Principles of the People, then Communism will also collapse without fighting. There is absolutely no need to worry.</p>
<p>At 10:00 AM on the same morning, the National Government held a memorial week for the Prime Minister. Yu Youren, Ding Weifen, Ma Fuxiang, Niu Yongjian, Lin Xiang, Zhu Lihe, Chen Yi, Gao Wei, Zhou Yawei, Wu Siyu, and officials from the National Government, military advisers, and accounting departments, totaling over two hundred people, attended. Yu Youren presided over the meeting and performed the rites. Ding Weifen then reported that China is currently facing internal and external troubles, and the recent flood disaster is unprecedented in decades. In addition, local bandits are rising up everywhere, and the Communist Party is looting and burning everywhere. The general public is in deep water and is very uneasy. Shi Yusan unexpectedly rebelled against the central government when the Korean people massacred the Chinese in Korea. This action should be related to the Korean case. Although Shi has been eliminated, Yan Xishan suddenly returned to Shanxi from Dalian, and the inside story is even more obvious. The government regards Shi and Yan as Li Wanyong. Now that the first Li Wanyong has been eliminated, the second Li Wanyong will naturally not be a problem. The government's top priorities are first, to provide disaster relief, and second, to suppress the Red bandits. As for the current situation, the government has always adopted a lenient policy to allow the reactionaries to become aware of themselves. If they do not repent, the government will punish them. After the report, the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Wu Daguang Asks the National Government to Give Plum Blossoms to the United States</p>
<p>Five Thousand Plants Will Be Planted Along the Mount Vernon Memorial Highway</p>
<p>Five Thousand Plants Will Be Distributed and Planted in Rock Creek and Potomac Parks</p>
<p>Wu Daguang, Counselor of the Chinese Embassy in the United States, recently submitted a memorial to the National Government, requesting that plum blossoms be given to the United States to strengthen Sino-American relations. Excerpts from the original text are as follows:</p>
<p>"I believe that Washington, D.C. is an elegant place with beautiful scenery and lush trees, known as the 'Garden City' of the United States. There are 490 parks in the city, including ten large parks such as Rock Creek Park, which covers 1,776 acres, and Potomac Park, which covers 723 acres. The number of trees is particularly noteworthy. There are 105,000 shade trees, surpassing Paris, which is famous for having 95,000 trees (see page 475 of Haskin's 'The American Government'). Therefore, people from all countries come to enjoy this paradise. Potomac Park, with its river and lake scenery, is especially beautiful. Several years ago, Japan donated many cherry trees to the United States government, which were planted along the lake. Every spring, when the cherry blossoms are in full bloom, tourists flock to the area, creating a bustling scene. With the great convenience of transportation in the United States, people from the West Coast take two or three days by car or five or six hours by plane to come to Washington, D.C. to enjoy the cherry blossoms. The situation is remarkable. I believe that the color, texture, and fragrance of our country's plum blossoms all surpass those of cherry blossoms. I still remember that in the winter of the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, when I was working in the Nanjing Judiciary, the Central Political Committee decided to make the plum blossom the national flower. The plum blossom is pure and noble, its fragrance is outstanding, its color is charming, and its five petals correspond to the five races of Han, Manchu, Mongol, Hui, and Tibetan, as well as Sun Yat-sen's Five-Power Constitution. It is appropriate to designate it as the national flower. Unfortunately, in recent years, the National Congress of the Kuomintang has not had time to discuss it, so it has not been promulgated. However, although it does not have the name of the national flower, it already has the reality of the national flower. Although plum blossoms are occasionally found in some places in the United States, their texture, fragrance, and color are far inferior to those of our country's plum blossoms and have never been mentioned. I believe that the weather in Washington is similar to that in Ninghu, China. If the soil is not too different, it would be a good thing to donate plum blossoms from our country to the United States. Moreover, February 22, 1932 (next year) is the 200th anniversary of the birth of George Washington, the founding father of the United States. Various places in the United States have been establishing associations and preparing for a grand celebration at that time. Mount Vernon, the former residence of Washington, is only 25 miles away from Washington, D.C. A new highway is being built to commemorate this event, and the opening ceremony is scheduled to be held on Washington's birthday next year. The planting of shade trees along the road is also being discussed. It is proposed that your government order the Ministry of Industry to select 10,000 fine varieties of plum blossoms to donate to the United States government. It is requested that 5,000 plants be planted along the Mount Vernon Memorial Highway (the new highway from Washington to Mount Vernon) and 5,000 plants be distributed and planted in Rock Creek and Potomac Parks. In a few years, the plum trees will form a forest, which will be very beautiful. In the spring, when the weather is pleasant and the scenery is beautiful, the plum blossoms will be like brocade, and the people will be like clouds, which will not only embellish the scenic spots and enhance the viewing experience but also invisibly benefit Sino-American relations."</p>
<p>Continued Records of the Tragic Flood Situation in Central China</p>
<p>Henan Province is Experiencing Frequent Disasters and the People are Living in Poverty</p>
<p>Last year, the National Government quelled the Central Plains War, and there were hopes for rest and recuperation. Unexpectedly, bandit forces raged in western Henan, and floods ravaged southern Henan. In addition to what has already been reported in various newspapers, the disaster situation in Xinyang and other counties and Zhoukou Township is disclosed as follows:</p>
<p>Xu Shengming, the magistrate of Xinyang County, reported that on June 29th, the turbulent and turbulent waters of the Tuanyu, Piao, and Sanhe rivers overflowed, and the Jiang, Shi, Jiaobei, and Hebei rivers also flooded at the same time, inundating the entire territory and collapsing southward into the neighboring Deng County. The Zhao River also overflowed and flowed into the county, turning the county into a swamp. It is estimated that more than 100 acres of fertile land have been washed away, and more than 2,000 houses have been destroyed. Efforts are being made to dredge and provide relief. On July 7th, the Tang and Bai rivers overflowed due to mountain torrents, with the water on the plains reaching a depth of more than ten feet. Fields and villages along the river were destroyed. The rain continues to fall, and the weather is as cold as early autumn. The disaster victims are waiting for relief. The Provincial Political Affairs Committee has already reported the situation to the Central Government and the National Disaster Relief Committee.</p>
<p>Chen Yuren and others from the Xinyang County Flood Relief Committee telegraphed that the disaster in the county since the heavy rains of the 3rd of last month is too terrible to bear. However, the weather has not cleared for a long time, and heavy rains fell again on the 23rd and 24th, causing the water level to return to its previous level, with more houses collapsing and livestock drowning than before. This is truly an unprecedented disaster. The Provincial Relief Committee has allocated 3,000 yuan and sent personnel to provide relief.</p>
<p>Yu Huaibin, Chairman of the Baofeng County Relief Branch, reported that the wheat harvest in the county this year was greatly reduced, and the people were living in poverty. On June 29th and 30th, heavy rains poured down, inundating the county. In the Da Niu Township, Xinyi Township, and Minzu Township along the Ru River, six or seven villages from Da Niuzhuang to Dongsha Gedang, and in the Huiji Township bordering the Shi River, five or six villages from Minyou Township Da Liuzhuang to Shian, and in the Wenhua Township to Tao Liu Township, forty villages including Qiezhuang, Bei Wangzhuang, and Da Taozhai, tens of thousands of houses collapsed, and crops were submerged. Even the hillside areas, which are overgrown with weeds, cannot be cleared due to the mud and water, and there is no hope for the autumn harvest. The people's livelihood has been cut off, and urgent relief is requested. The Provincial Relief Committee has sent personnel to investigate.</p>
<p>Xiong Wenxu, the magistrate of Yanling County, reported that since the beginning of summer, heavy rains have been frequent, and the low-lying areas have long been submerged. Unexpectedly, on June 29th, heavy rains poured down day and night, with the water on the plains reaching a depth of several feet. The Shuangbi River in the northern township, the Hongye River in the southern township, and the Qingliu and Sha rivers were breached one after another, destroying houses and drowning people and livestock. The harvested wheat that was exposed was washed away, and the wheat in the warehouses was soaked and sprouted. The autumn crops have all been submerged, and food has become a serious problem. He earnestly requests that relief be provided immediately. The Provincial Relief Committee has reported the situation to the Central Government and the National Disaster Relief Committee to request relief.</p>
<p>Kuang Youcheng, Chairman of the Tongbai County Relief Branch, reported that the county is located in the deep mountains of southern Henan. Due to inconvenient transportation, it has become a den of bandits. Since the Republic of China, it has been repeatedly ravaged by large gangs of bandits such as Bai Lang, Wu Xiaowa, Yu Huzi, Lao Yangren, Yin Laopo, and An Jianghu. This year, when Cui Erdan and other bandits took advantage of the chaos, they sneaked into the county and burned and killed people in a horrific manner. Local bandits such as Ma Guojun and Fu Laosan took the opportunity to seize three villages, causing turmoil. One disaster has not been resolved, and another disaster has struck. On June 27th, heavy rains poured down continuously for days, and it has been almost a month since the rain stopped. The collected water is like a sea. Because there are many high mountains, the water flows very fast, washing away people, livestock, and miscellaneous objects. Most of the houses and villages have collapsed, and the fields and ponds have been washed away. The hard work of half a year has been lost, and the seedlings are gone, with no hope for the autumn harvest. The livelihood of the people of Tongbai has been cut off, and urgent relief is requested. The Provincial Government has also reported the situation to the Central Government.</p>
<p>The General Chamber of Commerce of Zhoukou Township reported that since the beginning of summer, heavy rains have poured down for ten days without ceasing, and the fields have all been submerged, turning the land into a swamp. The Sha River was breached upstream, and the huge waves and angry waves were like galloping horses. In the dark night, countless people were swept away in their sleep. The severity of the disaster is rare in ancient and modern times. Zhoukou is under the jurisdiction of Shangshui and Xihua counties, and neither county has reported this major disaster. Therefore, we earnestly request that relief be provided so that the disaster victims who have no food or shelter can receive practical benefits and maintain their remaining lives. The Provincial Relief Committee has reported to the Central Government and the National Disaster Relief Committee to request relief.</p>
<p>The Danger of Rising Water in the Yalu River</p>
<p>Tributaries Along the River Rise in Unison; Efforts by Japanese Officials and Civilians to Prevent Disasters</p>
<p>Andong Correspondence:</p>
<p>Recently, the weather in the eastern border area has been gloomy and rainy. Since the afternoon of the 11th, the water level in the lower reaches of the Yalu River, between Andong and Sandao Langtou, has risen by four or five feet. The water level in the upper reaches is even higher. The merchants and residents of the port are concerned that the flood disaster of the summer of 1923 will strike again, causing panic. Wang Jiegong, the magistrate of Andong County, is preparing to prevent disasters and has ordered the responsible departments to purchase large quantities of rain gear and sacks for flood control. On the afternoon of the 11th, he also inspected the river dikes with Director Zhang and hired workers to repair them.

The police department will dispatch armed police to supplement the rescue and supply groups as much as possible. All personnel have special identification marks: security group - peach-colored armbands; rescue group - red armbands; protection group - white armbands; supply group - yellow armbands.

<p>Grain</p>
<p>River Down Rice Market Arrivals and Sales were Balanced.</p>
<p>The Origin of Various Merchants in the Southern Market Continued to Connect. It was Argued that the Market Sentiment Changed from Weak to Flat. Buyers' Intention to Enter was Due to the Continuation of Arrivals. Moreover, Stockpilers did not Relax, Leading to Scanty Sales. The Decline in Thick Japonica and Thin Indica Rice Stabilized. More Than 1,000 Stones of Dongxin Japonica Rice from the North and South Markets were Available. Scattered Sales were Scarce. Prices did not Rise or Fall. There was Not Much High-Quality Water-Grown Pointed Rice. Middle Grades were Crowded by Buyers, and the Market Seemed Slow, Leading to Price Cuts. Arrivals and Sales of Yin Hua Rice were Balanced, and the Market did not Rise or Fall.</p>
<p>Zhabei's Inland Arrivals were Limited. The Top Grade of Northern Japonica Rice was Scarce, and Movement Reached Nearly 1,000 Stones. The Market Price for Top Grades was Stable, and Middle and Low Grades Decreased by 4 Jiao. The Arrivals of Green 角, Indica Rice, and Jin Lu were Few. However, the Appetite was Limited, and the Situation was Weak. Water-Grown Pointed Rice was the Same. It was Argued that Pointed Rice was Scarce and there was No Market. Glutinous Rice was Not Prosperous or Humiliated. Although the Passages of Foreign Rice by Merchant Groups and the Main Street were Sparse, Buyers Showed Strength Because Stockpiles were Thin. Foreign Rice Sales were Sluggish and Decreasing.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Foreign Rice Market Situation in the Morning, Local Buyers Lacked Inflow and Outflow. The Market was Very Weak. Cargo Owners Desiring to Sell Quickly were Willing to Sell at Discounted Prices. The Situation was Even More Sluggish. Prices had a Potential to Decrease by 1 or 2 Jiao. Scattered Households and Stockpilers on the Main Street Took Advantage of Small Purchases. The Market Turned to Flat. A Total of More Than 1,000 Packages of Annam were Opened, Accounting for More Than Half. This was Because the Community Japonica Rice Price Plate was Higher. The Main Street Needed to Piece Together, so the Prices Opened at 15 Yuan, 14 Yuan 8 or 9 Jiao, and Subsequently 14 Yuan 5 or 6 Jiao. Yu Dang Rice was Only 400 Packages, and the Price was 13 Yuan 4 Jiao. It was Said that the Biao Flour's Subsequent Market Showed a Slight Decline.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Flour Market, After the Market Opened in the Morning, Various Months' Markets Saw Slight Improvement in the Foreign Wheat Quotation of 1 or 2 Jiao. In Addition, the Gold Price was Tense, so the Near and Far Term People's Hearts were Quite Firm (The Southeast Asian Merchants Also Moved Slightly). The Buying Momentum of Inland Merchants was Still Rushing. The Closing Prices for Various Months were Generally Better Than the Previous Week by About 1 Fen. Until the Market Opened in the Afternoon, the Market Sentiment Returned to Softness. The Wheat Market was Weak, and it was Rumored that Foreign Wheat, Which was Planned to Advance, Would be Sold to Chinese Merchants at a Low Price, so People's Hearts Suddenly Softened. Both the Near and Far Term Showed Laxity. However, the Number of Factory Sellers was Not Smooth, so the Decline was Not Much. As a Result, This Month was Slightly Better Than the Previous Week by 2 Li and a Half. September and October were Smaller by 2 Li and a Half. November was Better by 2 Li and a Half. December was Better by 5 Li. January was Smaller by 2 Li and a Half.</p>

<h3 id="e55">Unprecedented Flood Disaster, Current Status of River Transportation <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Hankou in Critical Condition, Trial Navigation on Inland Rivers</p>
<p>This flood disaster has affected as many as sixteen provinces, with the Yangtze River and the Grand Canal being the worst affected. Hankou has been completely submerged, with the city destroyed and transportation completely blocked. However, some of the inland river steamers in Shanghai have been able to resume navigation. The following is a report on the situation obtained by reporters yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Hankou Submerged, Transportation Blocked <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Warehouses Completely Submerged. Yesterday, various shipping companies in Shanghai received urgent telegrams from Hankou stating that the river water had risen sharply in recent days, exceeding 55 feet 6 inches. The entire city of Hankou is completely submerged, and the first floors of the docks and warehouses of various shipping companies are underwater. Office personnel from various companies have moved to the top floors, and transportation is entirely by boat. The shallow warehouses are submerged by as much as 15 feet, with countless goods floating away and losses beyond measure. Foreign shipping companies such as Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire have built sky bridges on the docks, directly connecting the ship sides to the second and third floors of the warehouses to facilitate the loading and unloading of goods, bypassing the floodwaters in the city.</p>
<p>Construction of Wooden Towers. The China Merchants Bureau received a telegram from Hankou stating that the water depth along the docks reaches over 10 feet. The branch manager, Li Yunliang, has purchased giant timbers worth over 10,000 yuan and is building a wooden tower in front of the dockside warehouse. The purpose of the tower is to prevent further flooding. The tower will have large overhanging beams, so that when a ship arrives, one end will reach the upper level of the warehouse and the other end will reach the ship's deck, allowing goods to be loaded and unloaded over the water into the warehouse. It is currently being built day and night, and will soon be ready for practical use, facilitating the loading and unloading of goods and passengers.</p>
<p>Dormitories Submerged. Yesterday, it was confirmed that the two dormitory buildings occupied by Jardine Matheson's employees in Hankou have disappeared without a trace, completely submerged in the floodwaters. Only the tops of the large trees in Hankou Park are still visible above the water, and the buildings have long since vanished.</p>
<p>Preparing Ships for Emergency. The lower-level offices of foreign shipping companies such as Butterfield &amp; Swire, Jardine Matheson, Nissin Kisen, Chekiang River Steamship Co., and China Merchants S.N. Co. in Hankou have all been submerged and moved to the second and third floors to operate. However, as the river water continues to rise, the companies fear further flooding and have each dispatched an empty river steamer to the docks since the 15th, ready for employees to board and evacuate in case of emergency. The China Merchants Bureau also sent an urgent telegram to Shanghai ordering a large river steamer to be dispatched to provide refuge for bureau employees in case of emergency.</p>
<p>Complete Interruption of Goods. Goods arriving via the Pinghan Railway have been cut off for some time. River goods from Yichang and Sichuan are also unable to be shipped due to the floods. Only a small number of goods from Hunan are being transshipped. Goods are almost completely cut off. However, thousands of flood-stricken refugees from Hankou, affected by the rising waters, have been fleeing downstream. In recent days, Chinese merchant river steamers departing from Hankou have been filled with refugees. Crew members cannot drive them away, even though they cannot afford tickets. Most of them are disembarking in Jiangxi and Anhui, and relatively few are coming to Shanghai. The compradores on each ship are suffering huge losses, but there is nothing they can do.</p>
<h3 id="e57">First Phase Opening of Inland Water Ferries <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Due to the flooding, the Shanghai-Suzhou line operated by the local inland water ferry companies had been suspended since July 6th, resulting in significant losses for each company for over forty days. China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (招商局) suffered daily losses of approximately six to seven hundred yuan, while Da Sheng Chang (戴生昌) lost three hundred yuan daily, and other companies lost between one and two hundred yuan. Recent surveys by the companies have determined that the Shanghai-Suzhou route can be partially reopened. Yesterday, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company assigned the Li Heng (利亨) ferry, and Da Sheng Chang assigned the Yuan Yu (原餘) and Da An (大安) ferries, etc., to resume operations on the first two days. Passengers are advised that only slow ferries will be available along the route.</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Hangzhou trial route was also suspended because of the numerous bridges and high water levels that made passage difficult. Recent reports indicate that the water level has slightly receded. China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Da Sheng Chang, and Lao Gong Mao (老公茂) have agreed to dispatch the Heng Shun (恒順), Heng Sheng (恒勝), Yuan Fa (源發), and Yuan Ji (源吉) ferries starting today for a trial run from Shanghai. A formal resumption of operations will be scheduled after it is determined that there are no obstructions along the route.</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Lake Tai (申湖) route, operated by six ferry companies offering both day and night services, has also been suspended for a long time. It has recently been reported that the Tian, Di, Yuan, and Huang sections of Lake Tai in Huzhou have been completely submerged. In the Li Li area, the water level has slightly receded. The six companies have decided to fully resume both day and night ferry services within the next two days. Personnel have already been dispatched via civilian boats to survey various locations in preparation for the resumption of operations.</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Ling (申菱) route to Jiaxing can reportedly barely accommodate boat travel. China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has dispatched the Xin An (新安) ferry to resume operations. The water level on the Jiaxing-Lake Tai (嘉湖) route has also slightly decreased. Yesterday, the Cheng Tai (承泰) ferry was also ordered to resume operations. As for the Shanghai-Wuxi (申錫) route, ferries will continue to operate in conjunction, with one route to Kunshan and the other to Dunhe. Passengers will be transferred between boats in the middle.</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Changzhou (申常) route remains closed due to the high water level. According to the companies, it will take at least two weeks before operations can resume. The water level on the Zhenjiang-Yangzhou (鎭揚) route is only subtly rising. This route is not expected to resume operations until September at the earliest. Of the thirty-plus inland water ferry routes, only the Shanghai-Suzhou, Shanghai-Hangzhou, Shanghai-Lake Tai, Shanghai-Jiaxing, and Shanghai-Ling routes have been partially reopened.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Yesterday's Emergency Relief Meeting for Flood Disaster Discussed Fundraising Strategies <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>According to Huadong News Agency, the Shanghai Emergency Relief Association for Flood Disasters in Various Provinces held a discussion meeting at the City Chamber of Commerce yesterday afternoon to determine fundraising strategies. The meeting discussed implementation methods until about 7 PM. The details are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Attendees: The meeting was attended by a large number of people, including Xu Shiying, Chairman of the Relief Committee; Wang Zhen, Vice Chairman; Zhang Zhijiang, Pacification Commissioner of the Jiangsu Pacification Commissioner's Office; Jiang Zuobin, the newly appointed Ambassador to Japan; as well as Wang Xiaolai, Wu Zhihao, Zhang Zhuping, Lin Kanghou, Wen Lanting, Zhuang Songfu, Li Zushen, Hong Yingbin, Huang Renzhi, Zhu Hui Seng, Li Cishan, Wang Boyuan, and dozens of others.</p>
<p>Discussion Agenda: (1) Electing a temporary chairman; (2) Reporting on disaster reports and requests for funds from various provinces; (3) Reporting on the recent work of the association; (4) Requesting representatives from various sectors to provide lists for distribution of donation booklets for fundraising; (5) Discussing fundraising methods; (6) Setting deadlines for pledged donations to be submitted to the association; (7) The association should first select the most severely affected areas for emergency relief; (8) Adjournment.</p>
<p>Discussion Summary: After formal greetings, Xu Shiying, Chairman of the Relief Committee, was elected as the temporary chairman. The chairman reported on the disaster situation in various provinces and recent requests for funds. Wang Xiaolai then reported on the recent work of the association. Subsequently, fundraising methods were discussed and donation booklets were distributed. Zhuang Songfu, Wu Zhihao, Hong Yanbin, Zhang Zhuping, Yu Daxiong, and others proposed fundraising suggestions.</p>
<p>Important Proposals: Many attendees expressed their opinions. The following proposals were submitted to the conference and passed: (A) Huang Yanpei proposed: (1) The massive flooding in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River will inevitably turn the downstream provinces and counties into a vast swamp within a few days. Jiangsu and Anhui have already reported disasters, and more serious emergencies are expected. How can we prevent them as much as possible? (2) To conduct large-scale fundraising and achieve significant results, we must start with the business income, property income, and personal salaries of various sectors and industries to arouse enthusiastic emotions from all parties. We must especially encourage our executive committee members to take the lead. If our committee members agree with this proposal, each member should report a certain percentage of their business or property income, or one or two months, or at least half a month of their personal salary. The resolution should be published in newspapers to arouse sympathy from all parties. Then, we should approach the owners of properties, such as houses, for fundraising without coercion. Since everyone desires to do good, we will surely achieve greater results. (B) Zhang Zhuping proposed: (1) Commercial organizations should contribute a certain percentage of their annual business income as donations. It is best if commercial organizations do this voluntarily, while the association formulates methods for implementation. (2) A certain percentage of the salaries of employees of commercial institutions should be contributed as disaster relief donations. The method should be the same as above. (C) Hong Yanbin proposed: (1) Hold a fundraising commemorative week; (2) First, borrow cash from the banking and financial industries to meet the needs of emergency relief. (D) Chu Hui Seng proposed: Focus on fundraising by industry, with donations set at one-fourth of one month's income. (2) Raise donations from schools: elementary school students donate 20 cents each, junior high school students donate 50 cents each, and high school students and above donate one yuan each. Faculty and staff should donate according to their abilities. (E) Wu Zhihao proposed: (1) Advocate for businesses to donate 5% or 10% of their seven-day revenue. A separate fundraising method should be established for non-retail businesses. (2) Free professional organizations should organize fundraising committees. (3) The press should organize a publicity committee. (F) Yu Daxiong proposed: Solicit disaster relief plans through newspaper advertisements. All of the above proposals were unanimously approved by the conference. Except for the organization of the publicity committee, which was decided to be the responsibility of Zhang Zhuping, and the immediate solicitation of fundraising plans through newspaper advertisements, the remaining proposals were immediately handed over to the association's standing committee for immediate action.</p>
<p>Adding Committee Members: Yesterday's meeting also added committee members to strengthen the association's internal organization: (1) Li Cishan, Huang Renzhi, Huang Yanfang, Wu Yunzhai, Wu Zhihao, Qin Runqing, Wang Boyuan, Zhang Zhuping, Hong Yanbin, Chu Hui Seng, Li Zuyu, Zhuang Songfu, Sun Choucheng, and Wang Yunzhang were appointed as members of the conference's design group. (2) Wang Xiaolai, Hong Yanbin, Cao Zhigong, Zheng Chengqing, Jin Guanfu, Zhang Yichen, Hu Fengxiang, Wang Pingnan, Chen Liting, and Lin Kanghou were appointed to be in charge of fundraising methods. (3) Zhang Zhuping and Dong Xian Guang were appointed as publicity committee members. (4) Xu Yongzuo and Pan Xulun were appointed as economic audit committee members for the conference.</p>

The meeting adjourned after the discussions.</p>

You were born in the spiritual lands of Puzhu and embodied the beauty of Mount Luofu. In your youth, you showed gentleness and virtue, and in your adulthood, you were known for your prudence and diligence. You knew the labor of gathering reeds and the reverence of picking water chestnuts. You assisted your husband in managing affairs in all directions, and together you soared ten thousand miles, like linked jade and a harmonious union. You taught with righteousness and thoroughness. You sealed your honor and cherished integrity, and nurtured aspirations like Mengmu moving three times. Your dignified demeanor and reputation spread far and wide. You were cared for with respect and joy in your old age, and you enjoyed the scenic beauty of the mountains with a cane. The nine peaks were shrouded in mist, and the two peaks of Mount Lao were green. Suddenly, you left this world and returned to your true home. People cherish your virtuous model, and the nation praises your merits. A mound on Longgang records your virtue, and history will praise your legacy. Your generation's mourning is splendid and follows the rules. We pour wine and offer words, may your spirit accept them. May you enjoy this sacrifice."</p>
<h3 id="e63">The City Chamber of Commerce Hosts a Banquet for the American Chamber of Commerce Travel Group <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Both Hosts and Guests Gave Sincere Speeches</p>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce hosted a banquet for the American Chamber of Commerce of Los Angeles Travel Group at the Chamber's regular meeting room at noon yesterday. More than fifty Chinese and foreign guests attended, including Guo Bingan, Guo Binwen, Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, and Xu Xinliu. Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Chamber, delivered a speech, followed by a response from the representative of the travel group. After the meeting, the Chamber's committee members accompanied the travel group to visit the Chamber's product exhibition hall and the domestic goods market, where they purchased many domestic products. The speeches are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce's welcome speech briefly stated that although the history of trade between China and the United States spans eight or ninety years, both countries are vast and rich in resources, and their populations are large. In the past, transportation was not very convenient, so there were few opportunities for contact between the people of the two countries, except for those who traded in each other's countries. Americans who wanted to understand the situation in China could only learn from books and magazines. However, the authors of these books and magazines may not have had an accurate understanding of the situation in China, or the information may have been outdated or limited to a local perspective, which was insufficient to represent the whole country. Therefore, there were very few Americans who had a genuine understanding of the situation in China. It is regrettable that after more than eighty years of diplomatic relations, the situation remains unclear. Therefore, the Chamber believes that to bridge the gap between each other, there should be continuous mutual visits and travel, especially for a longer period of time. The longer the visit, the easier it will be to thoroughly understand each other's situation, which is different from a hurried visit. It is said that the travel group will purchase Chinese products as a souvenir of this trip. The Chamber believes that this is of great significance because the foundation of the friendly relations between China and the United States for more than eighty years is built on "only seeking trade without other purposes." Therefore, the travel group's purchase of our country's products as a souvenir of their trip best demonstrates the true meaning of the lasting friendship between the two countries. On the other hand, it can show the actual situation of China's recent industrial progress. When the travel group returns and presents the souvenirs to relatives and friends, it can also allow the American people to spread and understand that China has indeed been engaged in peaceful construction in industry and commerce in recent years, so that the people of the two countries can build a new foundation for their diplomatic psychology. This trip can also lead the American people to have a deep impression of the goods that they need and that China can supply, and jointly work on the reform of tariff policies so that both Chinese manufacturers and American consumers can be satisfied. This is all thanks to the travel group's visit.</p>

<p>The American travel group's response briefly stated that it is a great pleasure that the people of China and the United States can gather together today. At the same time, they thank the Chamber for the lavish banquet and kind hospitality. The speaker represents the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce travel group and various business circles in Southern California to come to the Far East to investigate business and sightseeing. The purpose is to expand the commercial shipping between Southern California and the East. This sightseeing is not the end, and there will likely be other sightseeing groups coming one after another in the future. They hope that your country will also come to our country for inspection from time to time. Former US President Roosevelt once said that there are three major periods in the world: one is the Mediterranean period, which has become a past period; the second is the Atlantic period, which is nearing its end; and the third is the Pacific period, which is in full swing. Mr. O'Malley's speech in the United States in 1915 also said that the prosperous period of the Pacific has arrived. Therefore, I believe that China has made great contributions to the development of the Pacific. In the first week of May next year, the National Commercial Association of the United States will hold a conference in Honolulu to discuss all commercial issues along the Pacific coast. The solution to this problem is the realization of the new Pacific landscape in a few years and thousands of years. We deeply hope that your country can join and submit what you want to discuss and what you hope for at that time. We also hope that China can send more athletes to participate in the World Games in 1932.</p>

<p>Jiangsu Flood Disaster Righteous Source Association, initiated by Xu Jing Sheng and actively organized, has been issuing notices for days, inviting people from all walks of life to participate. It is scheduled to hold an establishment meeting at Renji Hall at 4 PM today. Hu, Director of the Civil Affairs Department of the Provincial Government, and others will come to Shanghai to attend the meeting. It is said that the meeting will not solicit donations, but will discuss fundraising methods and report on the number of funds allocated by the province. However, it is heard that disaster reports from various counties are coming in one after another, making it difficult to provide relief evenly.</p>
<p>It is heard that the association is of an official-righteous joint venture nature. It will use the donation booklets of the Provincial Relief Affairs Association to raise funds without issuing separate donation notices. However, the funds will be used by the association to hire people of high reputation to implement relief measures in accordance with righteous relief methods, in order to achieve practical benefits.</p>

<p>Letters and Telegrams Calling for… Discussing Methods</p>
<p>Hubei: The Committee for Raising Emergency Relief Funds for the Hubei Province Flood Disaster of the Hubei Fellow Townsmen Association in Shanghai sent a telegram to the Hubei Emergency Relief Association, saying: "To Mr. He Hengfu and Zhou Xingtang of the Hankou City Chamber of Commerce, and the gentlemen of the Hubei Flood Disaster Emergency Relief Association: The Central Relief Association has allocated 170,000 yuan to Hubei. Xu Jing Lao inquired whether Hubei urgently needs rice and flour or cash. Please telegraph immediately so that it can be forwarded and followed. Hubei Fellow Townsmen Association kowtows. Also sent a letter to He Hengfu, Zhou Xingtang, Cai Fuqing, Zheng Xieqing, and Xiao Chunqing of the Hankou City Chamber of Commerce, saying: We have remitted 10,000 yuan by telegraph from the Shanghai Bank to be handed over to the Hubei Flood Disaster Emergency Relief Association for distribution. We have also sent a letter. It has been more than seven days and we have not received any information. Please reply immediately. Greetings."</p>
<p>Ningbo: The Ningbo Fellow Townsmen Association in Shanghai and the Shanghai Siming Guild are deeply concerned about the severe flood disaster in Hankou and the situation of the fellow townsmen in Hankou. Yesterday, they sent a telegram to inquire about the disaster situation. The telegram said: "To the Ningbo Fellow Townsmen Association in Hankou and all fellow townsmen of the Siming Guild and Ningbo Guild Hall: The flood disaster in Hankou is severe. Many of our Yong people are in Hankou. What is the recent situation? Should we find ways to provide relief? We should cooperate and proceed. Please reply by telegram. Ningbo Fellow Townsmen Association in Shanghai and Shanghai Siming Guild."</p>
<p>Anhui: The Flood Disaster Emergency Relief Association organized by the Anhui Fellow Townsmen Association in Shanghai held an establishment meeting yesterday. Li Cishan chaired the meeting. Xu Jingren, Li Cishan, Li Weihou, Xu Jingren, Li Zhenya, Liu Zuwang, Cheng Linsheng, Cao Zhigong, Huang Jingquan, Yu Langxi, Guan Yunnong, Xu Jiyu, Wang Dizhai, Zhu Jingan, Yu Jiegao and fifteen other persons were elected as standing committee members. The meeting discussed fundraising plans, dividing them into two steps: fundraising and emergency relief by the association, and suggesting to the national and provincial authorities to issue public bonds. It was also decided to request relief from relief agencies and to hand over all decisions to the Standing Committee for planning and telegraphing to Anhui fellow townsmen in various provinces and cities to jointly organize relief.</p>
<p>Tongling: The Tongling County Flood Relief Committee in Shanghai sent a telegram to the national newspapers, the Relief Committee, the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association, the Red Cross Society, the Red Swastika Society, the Jisheng Association, various charitable organizations, and the Anhui Fellow Townsmen Associations in Beijing, Shanghai, Ping, Tianjin, Hankou, Guangdong, and Jiangsu, saying: "The flood disaster in Tongling this time is extremely severe, and a great catastrophe has been suffered. The eastern, western, and northern sides of the county have been flooded by the Yangtze River. Ninety-six dikes and thirteen islands have collapsed, and more than 30,000 villages and more than 170,000 disaster victims have been submerged. It is almost like selling children and selling daughters to survive in the waves. It is an unprecedentedly tragic situation. We dare to ask kind people and philanthropists to gather strength and provide clothing and bedding for the people. Every drop of water is a life-saving pill, and tears and blood make up the picture of the refugees. Tongling County Flood Relief Committee in Shanghai kowtows."</p>
<p>Wuxi: The Wuxi Fellow Townsmen Association in Shanghai held a council meeting on Qipu Road yesterday to prepare for disaster relief matters. Chairman Kuang Zhong'e announced the purpose of the meeting. Sun Zhidong then reported on the disaster situation in Wuxi, saying that there was no harvest of silkworm cocoons or wheat this year, and there was also a flood disaster. The dikes collapsed, and the land was covered with water. The fields and crops were submerged, and the villages and houses collapsed. The starving were everywhere, and the situation was miserable. The association should urgently rescue them. Ding Zhonghu then expressed his opinion, saying that the county has suffered a terrible disaster this year, and the tragic situation is unbearable to speak of. It is urgent to organize a disaster relief association. On the one hand, we should donate cash, and on the other hand, we should request the government to allocate funds for disaster relief and exempt this year's grain. Sun Beixuan and Xiao Xiaoren then proposed to appoint Cai Jiansan, the director of the association, as a representative to investigate the actual disaster situation in Wuxi, and to contact various public groups and the Puren Charity Association in Wuxi. At the same time, we should actively organize a disaster relief organization to raise funds for emergency relief. The association should quickly establish a disaster relief association. The chairman approved all of the above before adjourning the meeting.</p>
<p>Sichuan: The Sichuan Fellow Townsmen Association in Shanghai sent a telegram to the Nanjing Relief Committee, saying: "The telegraph has been delivered. The flood disaster in Sichuan this time, according to reports from hometown letters, the areas in eastern and southern Sichuan that have been passed through by the tributaries of the Yangtze River have mostly suffered from the collapse of fields and crops, and the destruction of homes. It is a tragic situation that has not been seen in a hundred years. Among them, the situation is particularly severe in Hejiang in southern Sichuan, where eleven of the sixteen districts in the entire county have been submerged in water. Other areas in the Jiang area have also suffered from strong winds and hailstorms. Tonggu and Gulin counties have also been completely submerged, and almost no peaks can be seen. In Xiushan and Pengshui in eastern Sichuan, the water is nine feet high, and the plains have become rivers. In addition to the complete destruction of the salt fields and stoves, more than 1,000 elderly and children have been drowned, more than 3,000 houses have collapsed, and more than 2,000 acres of fields have been destroyed. It is particularly tragic to see. However, due to traffic congestion, the details have not yet been heard outside Sichuan. The association is appealing for relief from all parties. We have also received a telegram from Chongqing, saying that the Yangtze River has been rising for days, reaching nearly ten feet. Residents along the river have suffered severe disasters. The association is instructed to find ways to provide relief. The details of the disaster are not yet known at this time. However, considering that the downstream Wuhan is so severely affected, the flooded areas upstream can be imagined. Our Sichuan people are suffering from both a rice shortage and this disaster. The only thing they can look forward to is the relief from the central government. However, we read in the newspaper yesterday that the conference only allocated 10,000 yuan to Sichuan for emergency relief. The conference has its own difficulties. However, with more than one million disaster victims sharing this 10,000 yuan for emergency relief, it is indeed unable to meet the urgent needs. The conference is the center for national relief, and it is said that it treats everyone equally. We hope that you will look west and not forget the distant ones. Allocating one more yuan for relief can save one more life. Saving one more life can add one more merit. Therefore, we cannot help but earnestly ask you to pay special attention and give generously to rescue our people from the sea of suffering. If you can think deeply about the people's suffering and convey the will of the people to the central government in a timely manner to urge it to withdraw the order to issue Sichuan bonds and stop the Sichuan warlords from levying exorbitant taxes, then it will be the fundamental relief for our people, and its merit will be above emergency relief. The telegraph is urgent. I hope you will consider it carefully. Sichuan Fellow Townsmen Association in Shanghai kowtows."</p>
<h3 id="e68">Western Medicine Industry Donates Medicine to Help Disaster Relief <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, Xiang Songmao, General Manager of the Wuzhou Pharmacy, invited colleagues in the Western medicine industry to discuss ways to provide relief for the flood disaster at the Gongdelin restaurant. Attendees included Fan Hefu of the Tailu Pharmacy, Luo Huaibai, Yuan Hesong of the Jihuatang, Tu Kaizheng of the Jicheng Pharmacy, Yu Baosheng of the Taihe Pharmacy, Zhu Ruichen of the Zhongying Pharmacy, Chen Xingwu of the Xiexing Company, Guo Xuanqian and Ma Bingxun of the Zhongfa Pharmacy, and Western doctor Ma Yinliang. Xu, Chairman of the Flood Disaster Relief Association, Zhang Zhijiang, Wang Yiting, and Li Zushen were also invited to the meeting to report on the disaster situation. The Wuzhou Pharmacy immediately donated 1,000 yuan worth of medicine, and the other pharmacies each donated 500 yuan. At the same time, representatives were appointed to solicit donations from pharmacies that did not attend. The generous donations to benefit the disaster victims are enough to set an example for the world.</p>

<h3 id="e70">Application Period for Sun Yat-sen Stamps <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Submitted by the Directorate General of Posts for Ministry Approval</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of the new Sun Yat-sen stamps, which were shipped to Shanghai from the British printing company De La Rue on September 1 for use in postal areas nationwide, a reporter from the Guowen News Agency interviewed Mr. Han Zhongyi of the Secretariat of the Directorate General of Posts yesterday to inquire about the procedures. The reply was as follows:</p>
<p>The request has been submitted to the Ministry for approval. This time, the British printing company shipped 120 million Sun Yat-sen stamps to Shanghai. Subsequently, they will be shipped in monthly installments to reach a total of 300 million stamps annually. Because this is the first batch, the quantity is relatively large. The Directorate General has submitted a request to the Ministry to designate September 1 as the date for the implementation of the new one-cent, two-cent, four-cent, and two-jiao four-cent Sun Yat-sen stamps. It is expected that the Ministry will issue instructions soon. Currently, the Directorate General will continue to use all kinds of ordinary stamps with sailing ships and farmers as before until they are exhausted.</p>
<p>The preparation for distributing the required stamps to postal areas nationwide is usually handled by the Shanghai Postal Supply Office on Jiaozhou Road in this city. However, the scope of the postal areas nationwide is vast, and the needs of each area are inconsistent. The preparations for the distribution of the new Sun Yat-sen stamps this time will require detailed investigation and planning for different combinations. No statistical reports have yet been received by the bureau.</p>
<p>Regarding the situation of square-printed stamps, the Beiping Printing and Mint Bureau of the Ministry of Finance has been entrusted with printing six kinds of stamps of revolutionary martyrs Huang Kecheng, Song Jiaoren, Deng Keng, Liao Zhongkai, Zhu Zhixin, and Chen Yingshi. It is heard that they are already in production. Shen Nengyi, the director of the Beiping Printing Bureau, has come to Shanghai but has not yet contacted the bureau. Therefore, the quantity of these new martyr stamps that need to be printed each year and the cost of printing each year are not yet very clear.</p>
<p>Denominations of new stamps: The fixed denominations of the Sun Yat-sen stamps are one cent, two cents, four cents, two jiao, one yuan, two yuan, five yuan, and seven yuan. The one-yuan to five-yuan denominations are specially prepared for postage of parcels, overweight envelopes, and insured letters, and are not the yuan stamps counted in money orders. The six kinds of martyr stamps are divided into twelve denominations: half-cent, two-and-a-half cents, five cents, six cents, eight cents, one jiao, one jiao five cents, one jiao six cents, two jiao five cents, three jiao, four jiao, and five jiao. Each kind of martyr stamp is printed in two kinds. Because the bureau has not yet received any formal documents from the Beiping Printing Bureau on how the square-printed stamps are allocated and printed, there is no way to verify them.</p>
<p>Twenty-three postal districts nationwide: The national postal district plan has twenty-three locations. Some provinces are one district, some are two provinces combined into one district, or one province is divided into two districts that also administer other districts. According to the reporter's investigation, the following is a list: Jiangsu-Anhui District (Capital), Shanghai District, Zhejiang District (Hangzhou), Fujian District (Min County), Guangdong District (Guangzhou), Guangxi District (Nanning), Gansu District (Lanzhou), Shaanxi District (Xi'an), Guizhou District (Guiyang), Henan District (Kaifeng), Hubei District (Hankou), Hunan District (Changsha), Eastern Sichuan District (Chongqing), Western Sichuan District (Chengdu, including Xikang Province), Xinjiang District (Dihua, including Qinghai jurisdiction), Jiangxi District (Nanchang), Shandong District (Jinan), Hebei District (Tianjin), Beiping District (including Rehe, Chahar, Suiyuan, and Inner Mongolia postal jurisdiction), Liaoning District, Jilin-Heilongjiang District (Binjiang County, i.e., Harbin), Shanxi District (Taiyuan), and Yunnan District (Kunming). It is said that no districts have been established in Tibet and Outer Mongolia.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Dr. Jiang Kanghu's Talk After Returning from the New World <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Research on Chinese Culture There is More Prosperous Than in the Past</p>
<p>Responsible for Communicating Culture Between the Two Countries This Time</p>
<p>Americans Hope We Can Clear Internal Chaos and Establish Constitution Early</p>
<p>Wrote Gospel of World Recession on the Return Journey</p>
<p>Dr. Jiang Kanghu was hired by the U.S. government in 1927 to serve as a consultant at the Library of Congress to handle Eastern cultural affairs. He was later appointed as the Dean of the Chinese Academy at McGill University in Canada. This time, he returned to China to make contact with the Chinese government authorities. A reporter from the New Voice Society met with Mr. Jiang at his lodging yesterday, and he expressed the following:</p>
<p>Life in the United States: Mr. Jiang has spent four years in the United States specializing in the study of the advantages of Chinese culture and promoting its material aspects to the country as much as possible. He has been greatly praised by people from all walks of life in the United States. After he wrote the History of Chinese Culture, Canada specially established a Chinese Academy and hired Mr. Jiang as the dean to teach Eastern philosophy. Mr. Jiang is the only Chinese person who has recently served as a full professor in universities in Europe and the United States. In addition, he has translated 300 Tang Poems, and when they were translated, they were slightly corrected by famous British and American poets. Therefore, after the book was published, its sales have exceeded 5,000 copies. Purchasers from Britain and Japan are also numerous. The book is currently sold at other bookstores on Nanjing Road in Shanghai. In addition to teaching and writing, Mr. Jiang is invited to give public lectures more than 50 times a year. According to Mr. Jiang, the number of Americans studying Chinese culture is increasing day by day, and their interest is also greater than before.</p>
<p>Mission of Returning to China: One reason for returning to China this time is that he has been abroad for a long time and has many gaps in his understanding of the domestic situation. Although he usually sees it in newspapers, it is often inaccurate and slow, and there is very little correct information. Therefore, he intends to take this opportunity to return to China to see the domestic situation so that he can have a basis for future propaganda in the United States. At the same time, he also intends to meet with relatives, old friends, and family members in Beiping after a long separation to express his accumulated feelings. On the one hand, he is entrusted by the U.S. government to make further consultations on the cultural communication between China and the United States. He will request the Chinese government authorities and educational institutions to allow the transportation of valuable circulations, related to the history of culture, which are not isolated books, to the United States to be used for public research in the U.S. National Library. This will allow the United States to see the bright culture and national spirit of our country's history, and a glorious cultural history of our country for 5,000 years can also be promoted overseas.</p>
<p>Americans' Expectations of Us: Americans have always hoped that our country can be unified nationally and that politics can be put on the right track. However, although people in that country have many doubts about the unstable situation in our country in recent years, they also have no ill will. As for our overseas Chinese in the United States, when they are asked by people in that country about the domestic situation or when they give public speeches, they must explain what Americans are alienated and misunderstood, and the only goal is to let Americans understand the situation in our country, that is, modern China is an inevitable process on the road to revolution, no matter what. However, the goal of the whole country of China is still to seek freedom and equality for China. If you want freedom and equality for China, you must work together to abolish unequal treaties. Therefore, the first hope of Americans for our country is to clear internal chaos and banditry. At the same time, they hope to produce a sound constitution.</p>
<p>World Trends: On this trip, Mr. Jiang wrote an article of about 3,000 words entitled "The Gospel of the World Recession." The main idea is that in the past, the momentum of capitalists was completely due to the selling short and buying long in the exchange, and the result must be failure. The current world recession is the end of the bankruptcy of capitalism. For example, the United States is known as a rich country, but when money is not in circulation, it can only become a mineral. Therefore, since the United States has been in a recession, not only is there no interest in depositing money in banks, but also a handling fee must be paid every year. At the same time, the unemployed who are eliminated due to the recession have no support, so social peace must be greatly affected. The United States is like this, and other countries are also like this. Due to the pressure of the situation, the standard of living in the United States has to be reduced. As far as I know, the United States and Japan have both reduced by a quarter, and as the trend continues, there is no doubt that socialism will be implemented after capitalism collapses. Capitalism is like an airplane in the air, no matter how durable it is, it will eventually have to land. However, the current state of world recession has entered a stage that socialism must go through. Therefore, I said that it is the gospel of the world recession.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Sharp Increase in Cotton Imports <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>According to the news from the Chinese Cotton Mill Federation yesterday, the domestic cotton production in recent years has gradually become insufficient to meet the needs, and as a result, the number of American and Indian cotton imported is very large. The total import of American cotton in Shanghai in 1930 was 1,008,000 dan, and the total import of Indian cotton was 1,508,000 dan, which is the highest record of foreign cotton imported by our country. Unexpectedly, the import this year has increased even more. In the first half of the year ending at the end of June, the import of American cotton reached 619,000 dan, and the import of Indian cotton reached 808,000 dan. Currently, because foreign cotton is cheap, each factory has ordered a huge amount of foreign cotton. It is expected that the import of American and Indian cotton in the second half of the year will be more than the first half of the year, and the total number of American and Indian cotton for the whole year will exceed last year.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Li Shijia Returned to Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Li Shijia, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Navy Department, was previously ordered to go to Japan to supervise the construction of the Pinghai warship. The matter has now been completed. He arrived in Shanghai yesterday on the Japanese ship Shanghai Maru. He landed at 3 p.m. and went to the Gaochang Temple Naval Training Team Headquarters to meet with Vice Admiral Chen Shaokuan and report everything.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Municipal Government Protests Japanese Soldiers' Robbery of Goods, Japanese Consul General's Quibble <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Denies Japanese Merchants Requested Troops to Protect Goods, Will Respond to Municipal Government by Letter in Two or Three Days</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government protested to the Japanese Consulate General on the 14th of this month about the unreasonable detention and beating of anti-Japanese aid overseas Chinese committee members by Japanese sailors. The Japanese side has not yet responded to this matter. Yesterday, a reporter from the New Voice Society went to the Consulate General to interview Consul General Murai. According to him, after reading the protest letter from the Municipal Government, he has not yet responded. He will probably respond in two or three days. Before formally responding to the Municipal Government, he cannot inform them of the contents in advance because the reply has not yet been drafted. However, the occurrence of this incident was not caused by the dispatch of troops by the Japanese Consulate or any Japanese agency. When the anti-Japanese association inspectors seized the goods, the merchant requested nearby patrols to protect them. However, the patrols were not present, and if there were Japanese soldiers, these Japanese soldiers would certainly protect the merchants in accordance with the obligations of the military and would never sit idly by. This is the reason. As for the reports in Japanese newspapers that Japanese merchants sent representatives to request the Japanese side to send troops to protect the import or landing of Japanese goods, these are all untrue. It is common for merchants to send representatives to the Consulate General to petition, but they did not request troops to protect the transportation of goods, and the Japanese side has no intention of doing so.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Two Meetings on Resisting Japanese Goods <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce: The Luxury Goods Group and the Necessary Goods Group of the Resist Japanese Goods Research Committee of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce held their first joint meeting yesterday. More than a dozen committee members, including Ye Jiaxing and Zhang Shengyong, attended. Ye Jiaxing presided over the meeting and resolved the following cases: (1) Discuss the standard for classifying Japanese goods. It was resolved that the classification method can be carried out in two aspects: A. Send a letter to the Anti-Japanese Aid Overseas Chinese Association to borrow the Japanese goods survey booklet and have the association reprint and distribute it to each committee member for research. B. Send a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to forward it to the Jianghai Customs to extract the detailed items of imported Japanese goods and have the association print and distribute them to each group for review as the standard for future classification research. (2) Discuss the letter from the Coal Industry Association inquiring about the Japanese coal registration method. It was resolved that Japanese coal should be handled in accordance with the necessary goods treatment method before the domestic products are fully self-sufficient. The fund levy rate will be determined after research. (3) Discuss the letter from the medicinal materials industry association stating that Japanese medicinal materials are irreplaceable and request research. It was resolved that the items opened in the letter will be handed over to the inspection committee for investigation to verify whether they are true before further review. (4) Discuss how the meeting date of this group should be stipulated. It was resolved that it should be held on Monday afternoon at 1:00 p.m. sharp every week.</p>
<p>Anti-Japanese Association: The Design Committee of the Anti-Japanese Association held its fifth committee meeting in the conference room of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Fourteen committee members, including Zhu Wenqi, Cai Guo Jingluan, Li Wenjie, Feng Yixian, Ping Zhi, Zhang Peizhen, Lu Fengzhu, Pan Xulun, Xu Yongzuo, Kui Yanfang, Chen Songyuan, and Deng Zena attended. Zhu Wenqi was elected chairman and resolved the following cases: (1) Discuss the paper industry association's plan to resist foreign paper. It was resolved to hand it over to the drafter of the five-year industrial plan for reference. (2) Discuss the proposal by Committee Member Deng Zena to deal with the root causes of resisting Japanese sugar. It was resolved: A. Hand it over to the drafter of the five-year industrial plan for reference. B. Send a letter to the Guangdong Committee to suggest it to the Ministries of Finance. (3) Discuss the request from the Great China Match Company to copy and attach the names and quantities of the Japanese goods they need for verification. It was resolved to handle it in accordance with the industrial raw material regulations. (4) Discuss how to handle the fact that the paper materials used by the China Arts and Crafts Factory are a special product of Japan and there are no substitutes in other countries, let alone domestic goods. It was resolved to first have the factory send a letter to the paper industry association to find out whether there are domestic substitutes before further review. Finally, after a long discussion on the issue of drafting the five-year industrial plan, the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Second Propaganda Meeting of the Anti-Japanese Aid Overseas Chinese Association <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Chen Binhe Lectures on Anti-Japanese and Knowing Japan</p>
<p>According to the New Voice Society, the second propaganda meeting of the Shanghai Anti-Japanese Aid Overseas Chinese Congress was held at 3 p.m. yesterday in the auditorium of the YMCA on Sichuan Road. A large number of people participated enthusiastically. After the ceremony, Chairman Lu Jingshi gave a speech reporting on everything, and then invited Mr. Chen Binhe to give a lecture entitled "Anti-Japanese and Knowing Japan." Chen has expertise in the study of the Japanese Manchurian problem and has published the Japanese Research Monthly. His speech roughly stated: The topic I am going to talk about today is "Anti-Japanese." If British and French people were to talk about it, they might say, "The Chinese nation is a scattered nation with no complete organization and no spirit of collective effort. It should be bullied by others and should be preyed upon by others. The Japanese are not like this. Not only do they have the qualifications to be masters, but they also have the qualifications to be leaders." If Japanese people were to talk about it, they would definitely say, "The Chinese are too humble and often think that unimportant things are terrible." However, this problem is being spoken to Chinese people, and the audience is also Chinese people. Everyone knows that the motive for this anti-Japanese movement is the Wanbaoshan incident, and the origin of the Wanbaoshan incident was caused by the Japanese expelling Koreans from the country to carry out their aggressive conspiracy. The massacre of overseas Chinese in Korea was caused by excessive propaganda, manipulation, and instigation. Everyone, how pitiful and embarrassing is our Chinese position? Even the news of the detention of four anti-Japanese association inspectors on the 12th, is this something we should endure? Is this something that should be in our position? Speaking of economic severance, there have been eight times in history. The first time was in 1908, the 34th year of Guangxu, because of the smuggling of military supplies. The second time was in 1909, the first year of Xuantong, because the Japanese expanded their route in the Northeast. The third time was in 1915, the 4th year of the Republic of China, because of the non-recognition of the Twenty-One Demands. The fourth time was in 1919, the 8th year of the Republic of China, because of the Shandong problem. The fifth time was in 1923, the 12th year of the Republic of China, because of the recovery of Lushun and Dalian. The sixth time was in 1925, the 14th year of the Republic of China, because of the May 30th massacre. The seventh time was in 1928, because of the Jinan massacre. The eighth time is now. Each time can prove what our results are. From the perspective of Sino-Japanese international trade, it can be seen that each time has suffered a major blow, while the Japanese have said, "Your resistance has absolutely nothing to do with us." A part of the Chinese people has also echoed this due to the counter-propaganda of Japanese imperialism. However, I dare to believe that the Sino-Japanese economic relationship is very important and can definitely be implemented based on Mr. Liang Sibing's article in the July 29th Current Affairs News, "The Practical Effect of Resisting Japanese Goods," and Mr. DrcbareI's article in the August issue of the Current Affairs Monthly, "China Uses Resisting Foreign Goods as a Foreign Weapon," because China is Japan's second largest market and Japan's supply place. We don't have military power to resist him. We only have the method of economic severance that is more feasible. I further think that even if the method of economic severance has a loss, we are still better than the failure of military resistance. In Sino-Japanese trade, from 1868 (the third year of Tongzhi) to 1930, there have been 64 years. Except for 1870, 1891, 1892, 1893, and 1894-5, China has been exporting, and the rest have been importing from Japan. The Shanghai Machinery Federation has a saying: "The way for us to save ourselves is to adopt a policy of self-sufficiency and self-reliance, strive to create production, and stop the source. There is no obvious form of resistance, but there is the effect of developing industry. Speaking of saving the country, there is nothing better than this." I very much agree with this statement, and I think this is the only method of self-determination for our anti-Japanese movement, because resisting Japanese goods is passive, and advocating existing domestic goods is also passive. If we can combine the non-existent and strive to manufacture it, then that is our active method. If we implement this method, the necessary condition is to study Japan. What special things does Japan use to invade us most every year? In this way, we can have a basis. As far as the brothers know, it can be divided into four types: (1) Goods imported from customs: From 1929, the goods that exceeded 10 million at customs were sugar, cotton paper, flour, coal, and fish. It is lamentable to say that coal and sugar are still produced in Taiwan and the Northeast! (2) Japanese industrial raw materials exported: We know that there are wool, soybean cake, iron sand, etc. (3) Japanese factories in Shanghai and the three northeastern provinces: According to a recent survey, there are 43 factories with 1,064,206,84 spinning machines and 1,5467 wire machines. Their aggressive businesses also include ironwork, ceramics, brewing, transportation, printing, finance, rubber, and general merchandise industries, etc. (4) Tariff issues: In name, China is autonomous, but in reality, China is suffering. Now I am also thinking about Japan's research on us. It is really terrible to say that they are helping us research everything that we have inherent and have not taken care of. I remember that on the first page of the 30th anniversary album of the Xujiahui Tongwen College years ago, there was my map with many red lines drawn on it. It is said that the red lines indicate the routes that have been investigated and researched. Everyone, think back to how we are, how many people can do it in person? I often blame the warning words "Beware of Pickpockets" posted on the market. Our treasures are being picked off by others every day, why don't we know how to prevent them? Alas, the Japanese are really powerful. In the 60 years since the Restoration, they did not have the ability to accept Western culture at first and still used translations from Chinese. Now we have to learn everything from him. If you look at literature, medicine, philosophy, and science, how many are translated from them? No wonder Mr. Ma Xiangbo said, "Japan has jumped from eight to five among the world's eight great powers, and now it has jumped from five to one." Finally, I have two words for everyone. Our problem is like a suitcase that is lost and found. One person is looking for things in the box but can't remember clearly. One person said how many clothes and books are in my box, and how much money is there. As a result, who should get it? It's like a rich person buys an expensive book and ignores it, while a poor person steals a look at this expensive book. Who gets the result in reality? Gentlemen, China is this suitcase and this book.</p>

<h3 id="e83">A Record of Field Exercises at the County School <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government has recently been making great efforts in the training of the police force. The other day, County Magistrate Yan personally inspected the troops. The entire police force's uniforms were clean, their steps were orderly, the military music was melodious, and the flags were bright and impressive. The next morning at 6:00 AM, Inspector General and Chief Military Instructor Xu Yi, along with section officers Yan Maotang, Shen Zhongbao, Wang Qihua, and Li Jisheng, led the entire police school from South Tuo Road, turning to Tushan Bay, to Caohe, where they practiced field exercises nearby. These included on-road reconnaissance, garrison reconnaissance, and picket duties. The police trainees' movements were agile and their spirits were high during the exercises. In the afternoon at 5:00 PM, they returned to the county in formation. It is said that County Magistrate Yan believes that the county police are crucial to local safety and security, and since all areas within the county are wilderness, the police need knowledge of bandit suppression to adapt to the environment. Therefore, he pays great attention to military education. Moreover, the instructors at the police training school are specialized talents who are diligently teaching. In particular, Inspector General Xu's guidance is effective, resulting in excellent results. In the future, when the county police graduate and serve the local community, their impact on society will be far-reaching.</p>

<p>A Chinese man... a Russian child</p>
<p>The "North China Daily News" reports that on Sunday, a man named Sheng Delin (transliteration) drowned while swimming in an open-air swimming pool on Jiangwan Road. Initially, he sank to the bottom of the pool unnoticed. After the pool's rescue team searched for about an hour, they finally found him. Mr. Sheng and a relative entered the pool at 11:30 AM, floating and swimming for a while. Suddenly, around 12:00 PM, Mr. Sheng was nowhere to be found. His relative searched back and forth without success and urgently reported it to Mr. Gulang, a Westerner at the ticket office, who summoned the on-duty rescue team to search the pool. It was not until 1:15 PM that they found the body lying face down at the bottom of five feet of water. After carrying him out, a doctor who happened to be at the pool examined him and determined that he had been dead for an hour and could not be saved. The fire department was notified to transport him to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road in an ambulance. Mr. Sheng was 32 years old and had only been in Shanghai for a week because his sister was working as a nurse at the Red Cross Hospital, so he was temporarily staying there.</p>
<p>Also, on Saturday afternoon, a Russian child named Xie Leifu drowned while swimming in the Minhang Pujiang River with two friends. His body has not yet been recovered. Xie is known to have had heart problems, and it is believed that he had an attack that led to his drowning.</p>

<h3 id="e87">Qinglian Pavilion Owner Accused of Assault by Concubine <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Witness Zhu Lingdi Testifies to the Defendant's Violent Actions</p>
<p>Sun Yunqing (also known as Shao Rui), the 65-year-old owner of the Qinglian Pavilion teahouse on Fuzhou Road from Shanxi Province, was recently sued by his fourth concubine, Jiang Cuiling, through lawyer Chen Bingsing at the First Special District Court for assault and other charges. The court summoned him for questioning on the 10th of this month, and the details were recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Shen Shumu continued the hearing, with many men and women in attendance. The plaintiff Jiang Cuiling's lawyer, Chen Bingsing, and the defendant Sun Yunqing's lawyers, Zhang Deqin and Ni Zheng'ao, were also present on time. The plaintiff, Jiang Cuiling, with a delicate face, wearing a lake-blue printed Indian silk cheongsam, flesh-colored stockings, and gauze shoes, arrived hurriedly at the start of the trial. Judge Shen then questioned Ms. Jiang, who stated that she was 26 years old, from Haimen, and lived on North Chengdu Road. (Question) What is your relationship with the defendant? (Answer) I am the defendant's fourth concubine. (Question) How old were you when you became a concubine? (Answer) Fifteen years old. The defendant's treatment of me has always been poor. (Question) What are you accusing him of now? (Answer) I am accusing him of abuse and assault. (Question) When and what time? (Answer) Noon on July 22nd. (Question) What caused the assault? (Answer) Because on the night of July 21st, the defendant forcibly wanted to share a room with me, and I refused. The next day, I was slapped twice and punched in the chest, causing me to be injured and cough up blood. (Question) Were there any witnesses at the time? (Answer) Yes, Lingdi saw it. At this point, her lawyer, Chen, presented the prescription of the Chinese medicine practitioner Wang Zhongqi who treated Ms. Jiang and elaborated on the main points of the lawsuit on her behalf (the content of which was recorded in this newspaper on the 11th). He also stated that Ms. Jiang was also assaulted by the defendant in April of last year. There was a witness at the time, but she is now being held in confinement and is not allowed to testify. Furthermore, the witness, a woman named Zhu Lingdi, testified that she was 24 years old, lived on Shanhai Pass Road, and the defendant was her uncle, while the plaintiff was the defendant's fourth concubine. On July 22nd, when the defendant was beating the plaintiff in the room, she was also present and witnessed it. Then, the defendant's lawyer, Zhang Deqin, cross-examined Ms. Zhu once, and the defendant's testimony was full of evasions, claiming that the plaintiff's statements were entirely false. Why would I, at such an old age, beat her? As for the witness Zhu Lingdi, she only came to my house on July 24th, my father's birthday. How could she have seen it? However, after the plaintiff left, I received a letter from her lawyer, Chen, proposing conditions for divorce, including a request for me to deposit 20,000 yuan in the bank and provide the plaintiff with 200 yuan per month for living expenses and build a residence, etc. I did not agree, which led to this lawsuit. However, I have always treated the plaintiff well. We have lived together for over ten years and I have never abused her. She is suing me now, I believe, because she dislikes my old age. Judge Shen verified the statements and announced that the case would be adjourned to Wednesday for further hearing.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Guangdong Merchants' Hospital Resolves to Change Name <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Investigation into Impersonation and Fundraising</p>
<p>The Guangdong Merchants' Hospital was originally established by Guangdong merchants in Shanghai. The hospital's board of directors felt that the term "Guangdong Merchants" was too narrow in scope, and the annual expenses have been supported by donations from various sectors of the Guangdong community in Shanghai, not just by Guangdong merchants' capital. Therefore, it was resolved to change the name to Guangdong Hospital to better reflect the situation. The hospital's board of directors, in accordance with the regulations, convened a temporary meeting of founders and donors yesterday to legally resolve the name change to Guangdong Hospital, effective January 1st of next year. However, recently, unscrupulous individuals have been impersonating the Guangdong Hospital to solicit donations from Chinese and foreign individuals. Yesterday, the Changxing Shipping Company at No. 1 Guangdong Road and others brought receipts to the hospital for inquiry and found out they had been deceived. It was discovered that the hospital has been established for nine years, and all expenses have been covered by donations from the hospital's staff. Any Guangdong people who are enthusiastic about donating also send their donations to the hospital and receive receipts. The hospital has never sent personnel to solicit donations from the outside world. An investigation into the impersonation is currently underway.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Renovation of Central District Telephone Nearly Complete <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Expected to Return to Normal Today</p>
<p>Mr. Baode, the general manager of Shanghai Telephone Company, stated in an interview with a reporter from the Shenshi Telegraph Agency that the conversion of the central district's automatic telephone exchange to a fully automated system has been actively underway in recent days. However, during the conversion, the central district's automatic telephone exchange inevitably experienced congestion, making it difficult for telephones starting with the number "1" to connect or temporarily unable to connect. This is not due to telephone damage but is an unavoidable difficulty during the conversion process, similar to how congestion on a railway requires the preceding train to move before the following train can proceed. Therefore, the company published a notice on the 17th, advising central district users to refrain from using non-emergency telephones for the time being to reduce difficulties. The company is also working hard to minimize inconvenience to users. The renovation is expected to be completed today, and normal service should be restored.</p>

<p>Siming Hospital in Shanghai has been established for over a decade. The original wards were insufficient, so the hospital expanded its facilities on the original site of the ward on Avenue Eugène Protet to provide a place for sick fellow villagers to receive medical care. Renowned doctors were recruited to staff various departments, and outpatient services were established. For impoverished patients, medical treatment and medication were provided. Mr. Ge Yucheng, who has served as the hospital's director for many terms, has been particularly hardworking and dedicated in overseeing everything. Lately, the weather has been hot, and it is easy to get sick with the slightest carelessness. Although the hospital occupies a large area and has many wards, it is said that the problem of overcrowding has been felt early this summer, and latecomers often have no way to stay. The hospital is very sorry about this and is diligently working to find solutions to meet the expectations of fellow villagers.</p>

<p>Public Organizations to Express Serious Concerns</p>
<p>Cheng Xun of Jiangwan was ordered by the city government to be expelled from the fifth precinct of the Public Security Bureau after a resolution by the city party headquarters. Not only has he failed to repent and reform, but he has recently been living in seclusion in the Hongkou Sanguantang concession, associating with monks and Taoists and continuing his shamanistic practices. His followers are spreading his weak-willed and simple-minded ideas, and people are increasingly being misled by him. He has also been asking people to sell his so-called spiritual paintings and calligraphy on the streets. It is said that the Jiangdi community is planning to submit a petition to the city government and request that the concession authorities investigate and ban him. Unexpectedly, this Cheng Xun is using his despicable methods to lobby and secretly ask a few merchants to vouch for him, hoping to deceive the city government into rescinding his expulsion order so that he can return to his Dongyue Temple base in Jiangwan and stage a comeback. It is said that various public organizations and branches in the district will express serious concerns about Cheng Xun's situation.</p>

<p>Zhu Monk Dies with Eyes Unclosed</p>
<p>Huang Pi Asan, a rogue living upstairs in a carpenter shop at No. 278 Rue Massenet in the French Concession, approached Jiang Jinshan, a clerk, at the Xinfuyuan Teahouse No. 153 Xujiahui Road on the 13th to borrow five yuan, and when he did not succeed, the two sides started an argument. Zhu Monk (age 46, resident of No. 10 Ronghua Lane, Rue Massenet), a barber from Changshu in the teahouse, stepped forward to mediate. Afterwards, Huang, displeased with Zhu's mediation, gathered three or four people with wooden sticks and axes to confront Zhu on the afternoon of the 14th. They attacked him with sticks and axes, causing Zhu's legs to be slashed ten times, and he fell to the ground with stick injuries. The perpetrators fled immediately. Then, the teahouse attendant, A Mao, notified Zhu's wife, Fu, who reported it to the police. Zhu was taken to Guangci Hospital, where he died from his injuries on the afternoon of the 16th. The hospital notified the police station to send a detective to take the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch for an autopsy. Yesterday, the police chief reported to the Second Special Court, and Prosecutor Ding Shikui, along with forensic doctor Wei Ligong and clerk Zhao Yifen, arrived at the scene at 3:00 PM to perform the autopsy and take notes.

<h3 id="e111">The Nature and Purpose of the Pacific International Studies Association (Continued) by Chen Liting <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The establishment and work of the Pacific International Studies Association have already been briefly described above. The fourth conference will be held in our country in October of this year, and the time is approaching. Recently, there have been many misunderstandings from the outside world and a lack of deep understanding. Therefore, I will specifically elaborate on its nature and purpose. Subsequently, I will continue to write about its organization, work, and the process of the previous three conferences, and discuss the content of this conference to clarify the truth, dispel misunderstandings, and resolve doubts.</p>
<p>The nature of the Pacific International Studies Association can be seen from its constituent members. During the first conference, its members were mainly from the YMCA, similar to an international conference of religious activists. However, since the second conference, the composition of the members has been quite different from the past. It includes diplomats, educators, politicians, scholars, doctors, lawyers, entrepreneurs, and religious figures, with religious figures being a minority. It is not similar to the initial stage, which had religious connotations. Its members are neither entrusted by the governments of various countries nor representatives of groups with specific interests. They participate purely in a private capacity. Therefore, its nature is also different from political or economic conferences between countries. During discussions, they can speak freely and frankly, expressing themselves completely. After completion, there are not only no resolutions to be made, but also no need to seek consensus or express any particular position. The goal is to use research and discussion methods to reveal the crux of each issue and the cultural and socio-economic situation of each country to the world, and solutions will naturally emerge. This is also different from other conferences that require a formal meeting structure and specific results. In summary, the nature of the Pacific International Studies Association is simply the organization of an international private academic group.</p>
<p>Since this association is an organization of private groups, its purpose is completely different from various international organizations with formal missions. I will briefly list them as follows: (1) Appointing specialists to be responsible for on-site research to use the results of this research to stimulate continuous research on other Pacific issues. (2) The results of the research, whether in the form of papers or reports, are printed and exchanged with each other. When they are mature, they are used as the basis for discussing various issues. (3) Although it is impossible to obtain resolutions after discussion, the process of this discussion and the research of various experts can be published to the world, allowing the general reader to understand the content of the issue, so that correct public opinion can be generated. Moreover, because there is no resolution format, discussions are more detailed and unrestricted. (4) With clear and detailed research on facts, issues between various countries and ethnic groups can be used to promote mutual understanding.</p>
<p>The above is about its nature and purpose. I have often lamented that people in our country are indifferent to the changes in the global situation and the state of international politics and economics. Even the important issues within the country, such as how much industry is treasured, and other important political and economic issues, are mostly unknown except for a few who know the general outline. Therefore, in the past few decades, whenever there have been major domestic and foreign affairs, we have always suffered from a lack of reliable information to determine the direction of solutions. Doing things rashly often leads to delays and missed opportunities. Moreover, many important issues in our country are related to foreign countries. Due to the lack of publicity, the true facts are not clear to the world, which leads other foreigners to be confused by one-sided arguments and unable to have a correct public opinion. The facts are there, and everyone in the country is familiar with them. Now there is an international academic organization, the Pacific International Studies Association, which uses research as the basis for discussing various issues. The participation of people from the industrial and academic circles of various countries will inevitably reveal their difficulties and the results of their research directly, so that foreigners can understand the true situation. Although there is no solution to be found, the opinions disclosed by these experts may suggest possible policies for the governments of various countries. According to the second conference, British and Chinese representatives exchanged ideas frankly, and British policy was subsequently improved. At the third conference in Kyoto, a fierce debate on the issue of the three northeastern provinces awakened the Japanese people from the delusion that Dalian was already in their possession. In practice, this type of organization is not only sufficient to promote our people's understanding of the situation abroad, but also to enable foreigners to understand the current situation of our society, economy, and culture, as well as various important issues related to foreign countries. It is truly beneficial and harmless, and there seems to be no reason to criticize it.</p>
<p>The fourth Pacific International Studies Association conference was invited by our country's representatives to be held in China when the third conference was convened in Kyoto, Japan in 1929. Recently, active preparations have been made in various aspects. The content of this conference is divided into major and specialized categories. The major categories are (1) the international economic relations of the Pacific Ocean, and (2) China's international relations. The specialized categories are (1) food and population issues, (2) the political, social, and economic problems of non-independent ethnic groups in the Pacific Ocean, (3) cultural issues, (4) immigration and ethnic issues, and (5) labor issues and living standards. The topics discussed are the main issues in the Pacific Ocean today. Gathering specialized talents from various countries in one place to discuss related issues in detail will provide choices for those who solve these problems in the future. The purpose is clear and not to be criticized. Moreover, according to the Prime Minister's theory, it is not difficult to implement, but difficult to know. Today, China's economic and social problems are as numerous as hemp. Those who can thoroughly study and understand the crux of the problem are very few. The results of the discussions on various issues in our country at this conference will surely provide resources for reflection. The assistance from other mountains can be used, so how can it be said that it is not helpful?</p>

<p>— Man Yin</p>
<p>Success or failure in a career is not enough to judge a hero. Beauty or ugliness of appearance is not enough to measure a beauty.</p>
<p>Those who encounter many difficulties in doing things gain practical experience. Those who experience turbulence in love see true love.</p>
<p>Being in the world is like crossing a river. One should be careful when encountering strong winds and huge waves. Even when the wind is calm and the waves are calm, one should be diligent.</p>
<p>It is better to strive for life in reality than to seek pleasure in dreams.</p>
<p>Love without conditions is a lie. Affection with a cause is a proper statement.</p>
<p>If people can measure the hearts of others with their own hearts, then many unnecessary disputes in society can be reduced.</p>
<p>Young men and women can gain a lot of unexpected intelligence when seeking love, but they add a lot of unnecessary troubles when heartbroken.</p>
<p>The world in dreams is, after all, mirages. The world after waking up is the real world.</p>
<p>Love is like war. A beautiful face is a tactic. A glorious position is a soldier. Money is the food, weapons, and ammunition. If the tactics are not clever and the soldiers are not numerous, it is not enough to defeat the enemy. If the food is not plentiful and the weapons are not sophisticated, it is even less sufficient to win.</p>
<p>In modern agencies or companies, there is a kind of extremely unequal fact. That is, those who do more work receive less pay, and those who do less work receive more pay.</p>
<p>Peace comes from struggle. Justice is determined by power.</p>
<p>The twentieth century is a world where people eat people. Whoever has the qualifications to eat, also has the qualifications to be eaten.</p>
<h3 id="e113">The Rising and Non-Receding Capital Flood <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— Jiguan</p>
<p>The capital's flood disaster has been repeatedly reported by newspapers. In the past ten days, although the weather has been sunny and hot, the waterside area has not only not receded, but has also gradually risen. According to the people of the capital, the river water will not go ashore. Once it goes ashore, it cannot recede for several weeks. Now the water is accumulated on the flat ground, and the water depth can submerge the thighs. Even the footboards of rickshaws are submerged. If it rises a foot or so, traffic in the city will inevitably be blocked. This is probably because the upstream areas such as Hankou and Jiujiang are vast oceans that flood downstream, so the capital's river flow rises without receding.</p>
<p>I once saw in Shanghai newspapers that during the continuous rain in the capital, the streets and alleys were mostly turned into wetlands, and the ponds on both sides of Zhongshan Road overflowed. The fish scattered, so some set nets on the road to catch them. This is not the capital of the present great flood. Not only the fish on the road have escaped, but also the river water is turbulent, and fishing boats dare not take risks. It is not easy to catch, and the price has increased. The fish and shrimp on the market have been sold at more than double the usual price.</p>
<p>There is one more thing that those who do not understand the situation in the capital will inevitably find strange when they hear it. The residents of the capital mostly take water from the well. Drinking water comes from the river bank. All are carried by coolies who use waterwheels to move. Now the river water is several feet deep, and the streets of Xiaguan are mostly flooded. If you take water in the street, you can see cars and horses coming and going, and bare feet running in the water. It is dirty and unclean, and it is difficult to fill drinks. As for transportation on the riverside, it is unusually difficult to drag because of the deep water and heavy load. Affected by this, the source of drinking water is gradually becoming scarce. As a result, several public bathhouses have raised water prices. In the past, one copper coin per spoonful is now increased to three times. At this time, the weather is still hot and there is more demand for water, so everyone is frowning. The flood is due to excessive water, but unexpectedly, the drinking water has become a strange commodity due to the accumulation of water on the streets. This can also be said to be a strange thing.</p>

<h3 id="e115">Rock as Described by His Loving Mother <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>— Mo Yi</p>
<p>Rock grew up in California, USA. When I (Rock's mother claims the following) discovered his theatrical talent, there was no such thing as movies. So I wanted to make him a famous stage actor. And he himself decided to go down this road. But I didn't expect him to have today. Although his success is due to his theatrical talent, it is ultimately attributed to "movies." If he were a stage actor, I am afraid he would not be famous in the world.</p>
<p>When he was very young, he and his brother, Gerald, performed some childish games. In their view, it was a dramatic act. But sometimes I felt they were quite interesting. So I gave them some guidance. When he grew up a little and went to school, he already had considerable achievements. His performance was simply not childish at all. In school, he often participated in talent shows and performed comedies, which won him good reputation. People praised him as a promising comedian.</p>
<p>When he was sixteen years old, his father took him to see a movie he had never seen before. This was terrible. Since watching the movie, it was simply difficult to stay at home. He was always outside all day long. I don't know what he was doing outside. Soon, the news that he went to a movie company to work as an extra reached my ears.</p>
<p>One day, the director chose him from a large group of children and asked him to try it. He performed very well and was able to satisfy the director. So his name was entered in the payroll. But his talent was not discovered by the director. He only played a supporting role. He played all supporting roles. And he could play them vividly. The audience said that he had a bright future.</p>
<p>He has a picky temper. So he has never been satisfied with the movies he starred in. He always wanted to have better results next time. If someone praised him for his good performance in person, he would always answer, "I don't think so. You think this movie performed well here or there. But I still don't think it's so good. I think I might have more satisfactory results next time."</p>
<p>Although he is famous all over the world now, he is still a simple-minded, enthusiastic worker, and a completely childish person. He loves sports. The house has a fifteen-acre sports field. Among them, there is a nine-hole miniature golf course, tennis and baseball fields, and a large swimming pool. He is as dedicated to sports as he is to filming. So he has a very strong physique. He neither smokes nor drinks. What is even more strange is that he doesn't even like tea and coffee. He only likes to drink cold milk. His family is full of happy air. His love for his wife is unmatched in the world. And he loves his two daughters, one son, and loves his wife as much as he loves her.</p>
<h3 id="e116">A Short Account of the Farewell Party for Students Going Abroad <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— Ping</p>
<p>Yesterday, various cultural groups at sea held a farewell party for this year's students going abroad at the Chen Family Garden on Seymour Road. More than 150 guests attended. The garden is grand and spacious. We enjoyed, strolled, and chatted in the thick shade of green trees, which was already full of leisure and fun. In addition, there were photography, tea parties, speeches, music, and so on. Naturally, there were many materials to record. So I extracted one or two to make people smile.</p>
<p>The Little Sisters Also Swim: The facilities of Chen's Garden are really good. There are sports fields and family swimming pools. Their whole family, old and young, all like sports very much. Before the meeting started, we watched swimming around the pool. There were four little sisters who were the granddaughters of the garden owner, Chen Bingqian. The youngest was five or six years old, and the oldest was only twelve or three years old. They floated and sank freely in the clear waves. They were very familiar with various swimming styles. And they can jump into the water from a very high diving board. It can be seen from the glimpse of their training. This kind of family sports is worth imitating by our people.</p>
<p>Xu Peihuang's Sincere Heart: After the scene of taking pictures on the lawn was over, we entered the auditorium in order. Among the guests were educators, scientists, diplomats, economists, and socialites. They were all together. The ages ranged from ten years old to seventy or eighty years old. The so-called "the wise and the young gathered together." This meeting seemed similar. Chairman Xu Peihuang gave a speech after the ceremony. He started by saying "...recalling the students who went abroad in 1909, they had to cut off their braids first and put on a Western suit. But no one would come to say goodbye. Only you send yourself. The family members cried and said goodbye reluctantly. However, it was only twenty years ago. It's really too far apart. He hopes that students studying abroad will carefully observe the essence of European and American material civilization, and the spirit of seeking truth from facts and marching forward bravely, and bring them back to the motherland for application. If you learn their extravagant habits, such as the splendor of the dance halls, and compare the advantages and disadvantages of the Shanghai Da Dong and Da Hu, then you will go on the wrong path."</p>
<p>Wu Jingxiong's Overseas Romance: Some people call Mr. Wu a foreign doctor. But this time his great theory praised the prosperity of poetry, books, etiquette, music, and ancient Chinese academics. He said, "For example, the news industry and public opinion authority in Europe and the United States have only recently become great. In China, Confucius and the ancient masters revised the Book of Poetry and compiled the Spring and Autumn Annals thousands of years ago. He was the original news reporter. Westerners' intelligence and talent cannot catch up with us Chinese. So don't be discouraged." He also said himself, "I am old and cannot do anything for the country. I hope you all will do well." In fact, Mr. Wu is only in his thirties, in his prime and promising. How can he be called old? Finally, he reported the anecdote in Europe and the United States earlier. "In a certain year in the United States, a general youth took perms as fashionable. I also often went to get perms. Unless I didn't have money by my side, I wanted to try dancing and prostitution. Especially those who went to Paris should avoid the temptation of lust. Once I saw a beautiful young girl in a theater in Paris. She gave me several loving hints and started her seduction work. I politely refused and said, "I am already married and cannot love you." She calmly replied. "It doesn't matter if you are married." It is not easy to deal with such a lewd society. Wu drew east and west, and his witty remarks were full of fun. He spoke in a Shanghai accent, mixed with Ningbo dialect, Mandarin, and English. The audience could not help but laugh.</p>
<p>Wu Zonglian's Interesting Words During the Meeting: A senior in the diplomatic circle, former Italian ambassador Wu Zonglian, also came with a cane. The old man was very interested and in good health. But he was deaf in both ears. In the quiet meeting place, he made a few loud and interesting remarks. When Wu Jingxiong gave a speech, he asked, "Who is it?" Someone wrote "Wu Jingxiong" in reply. He said, "Oh, he is Wu Jingxiong. He is so young, why does he say he is old?" He also said, "Mr. Wu's romance adds a lot of good materials to the newspaper." Because his voice was loud, the audience burst into laughter, breaking the silent air. Some people said that the old man heard very clearly and his ears were not bad.</p>
<p>Luo Chihui Said He Wanted to Be a Thief: The chairman announced that each person would add music to help the fun after the speech to meet the needs of the audience's psychology. Ms. Li Xianmin and Mrs. Guang Di's piano, Chen Zhijun's solo, and Mr. Dai Cuilun's harmonica were highly praised by the audience. The next student representatives gave a reply. Ms. Luo Chihui studied in Europe, and Mr. Lin Shibo studied in the United States. Ms. Luo said, "We must have the ability to be thieves and steal things when we go abroad." Some people thought, what is the intention of saying this immoral behavior? She continued, "In addition to working hard in books, we must use clever methods to steal the secret things in their science..." Everyone understood this extraordinary insight. The meeting ended at seven o'clock with great interest.</p>

<p>— Yao Sufeng</p>
<p>After everything was made clear, Miss Ding realized that Mr. Lu was really a heartless liar. He lied to himself, his parents, his wife, and her. I only hate myself for not seeing clearly at the beginning, but relying on his temporary false flattery, I thought he was a good man to entrust my life to, so I suffered a lot of injustice. How can I not regret it?</p>
<p>Xiao Rong's wife heard Miss Ding tell her about the past, and she really felt sorry for Miss Ding. The two people talked and talked. Although they all complained about themselves, sighed sometimes, and shed tears sometimes, they talked very speculatively, and they did not hate each other at all.</p>
<p>"You have come to Shanghai alone and are unfamiliar. Stay here with me today. After a while, he will definitely come. Then question him!" Miss Ding immediately ordered Qiu Zi to arrange a bed for Xiao Rong's wife to live in, and instructed Qiu Zi not to tell the old lady, lest she get angry. But I thought about it myself, and I couldn't help but feel a burst of sadness.</p>
<p>At this time, it suddenly started raining heavily. In the lightning and thunder, the doorbell rang.</p>
<p>Qiu Zi was arranging the bedding upstairs. When he heard the doorbell ring, he opened the small window in front and saw that it was Mr. Lu who was back. He immediately ran downstairs to tell Miss Ding.</p>
<p>When Miss Ding heard Qiu Zi say that Mr. Lu was back, the fire in her heart burst out, but she thought that if he came in and exposed the matter, he would inevitably become angry and annoyed, and maybe he would cause trouble. It would be even more unpleasant to publicize it. Therefore, Miss Ding told Xiao Rong's wife to wait in her own room upstairs for a while, and repeatedly told her not to come out and quarrel with Xiao Rong immediately when she saw him, so as to act accordingly.</p>
<p>Xiao Rong's wife already believed in Miss Ding very much, so she listened to her and was led upstairs by Qiu Zi to hide in Miss Ding's back room. At the same time, Miss Ding went to open the door herself and let Xiao Rong in.</p>
<p>"Why didn't you open the door for so long? The rain is so heavy that my clothes are wet!" Mr. Lu said with a smile. Miss Ding did not answer him, but went upstairs by herself. Mr. Lu followed behind and went to the bedroom together.</p>
<p>Mr. Lu took off his clothes and sat down. He saw that Miss Ding's expression was not good, and she didn't say a word. He was naturally a little strange. He asked, "Why is your face so bad today? And you didn't say anything?"</p>
<p>"I'm sick," Miss Ding replied briefly.</p>
<p>"You have to see a doctor when you are sick!" Mr. Lu was still very attentive.</p>
<p>"I don't need to see a doctor. I think you should know the cause of my illness!" Miss Ding's voice trembled when she spoke.</p>

<p>— Ke</p>
<p>Every day when the setting sun falls and the night falls, I hurry to collect the messy books and stand in front of the window on the street with a kind of quiet mood, looking at the changing clouds in the beautiful sunset. At this time, there will always be a familiar sound of the Huqin coming from the alley. When she plays the wandering and tragic tune and walks past my window, it will inevitably cause a vibration in my heart and send out a desolate feeling of being in a foreign land.</p>
<p>After a hot and stuffy day, white clouds gradually began to gather in the sky, becoming more and more numerous, and suddenly turning into a gray vault of heaven. The leaves of the drooping sycamore tree rustled in the wind. Dragonflies flew in groups around the shade of the trees. Under the trees, there was a noisy chatter of children laughing and adults talking. At this time, the intermittent sound of the Huqin drifted into the alley again, passed under the window, turned into the narrow alley behind the house, and suddenly turned back, stopping suddenly under the sycamore tree. It seemed that she had tightened the strings, and then played rhythmically, mixed with the woman's hoarse singing.</p>
<p>I sat at the table and looked down. "Ah!" There were so many people under the tree, adults and children, standing and sitting, in a circle. In the middle of the circle, there was a long bench with a woman in her forties sitting on it. Her hair was long and draped below her collar, her skin was yellow and thin, and her shoulders were high. She was playing the Huqin and opening and closing her wide lips, emitting a kind of broken bronze sound. Although her singing was so unpleasant and could not arouse people's pleasure, the people gathered around to listen all appeared so excited, so happy, so proud, especially the nanny of the Li family next door. She patted her fat belly and often patted the fat feet of a fat white child in her arms, her eyes smiling like Maitreya Buddha.</p>
<p>"Little sister, how old are you? Do you like to listen to songs?" After the woman finished singing, she leaned the Huqin on her body and pulled a girl standing in front of her and asked. The girl smiled and nodded, took out a few copper coins from her pocket and gave them to her.</p>
<p>"Oh, thank you, little sister. You are really sensible!" A kind of unnatural flattery appeared on her face full of wrinkles. She shrugged her shoulders and looked at everyone and said.</p>
<p>So a few people in them also gave her some money.</p>
<p>"Hey, how much money can you earn every day like this?" A woman wearing glasses and sewing clothes asked.</p>
<p>"Alas, sometimes I can't even get a bowl of white rice," she twisted her neck and sighed slightly.</p>

<p>"Then why did you do that? Aren't things like what we do more reliable?" Aunt Zhang from my house said with pity.</p>
<p>"Yes, but who would want to hire me? I am so weak," she said, rubbing her eyes with a handkerchief, making the rims of her eyes red. "There is nothing I can do now, I am always short of breath and coughing – there were good days before, but now there is nothing left, just a beggar on the street."</p>
<p>"There were good days before? What was that like?" everyone asked in surprise, as if this was an interesting story. She glanced at them, hesitated slightly, and frowned, saying, "Speaking of which... " She contradicted herself, "But what does it matter? Who can control their own destiny when they are young?" She then began to tell her story, saying,</p>
<p>"When I was eight years old, there was a famine in my hometown. My parents, unable to endure the hunger day and night, took</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>me to Jiangnan. At that time, I was so surprised and envious of the prosperity and beauty I had never seen before. I didn't know anything, just followed my parents wandering the streets and alleys all day long. Once, a sneaky-looking stranger said something to my father and forcibly dragged me to a place. I seemed to know that it was not good for me, and I kept crying – my mother seemed to be shedding tears too – but it was all useless. Finally, he sent me to someone's house."</p>
<p>"Oh, was it a mansion? Was it a house of prostitution?" Li's nanny asked.</p>
<p>"Guess," she smiled and continued.</p>
<p>"I spent two or three years in a daze, and then someone introduced me to a theater to live the life of an opera singer – I played a female martial role."</p>
<p>"That's not easy, can you do those tricks?" A cook-like man standing at the base of the wall said.</p>
<p>"Yes, I've liked doing these things since I was little."</p>
<p>"Who taught you?" Li's nanny said.</p>
<p>"No one taught me, I learned it playing with the children next door."</p>
<p>"Have some virtue, always interrupting people," the woman wearing glasses said impatiently.</p>
<p>She touched her hair and continued,</p>
<p>"One day, which was the last day of my luck, was a night of bright lights and fancy drinks. I was drinking and playing finger-guessing games with gentlemen in a beautiful hotel. At that time, because I had had a few more drinks, I walked out of the hotel door in a daze and took a car straight to the theater. That night, the opera I was performing required me to somersault down from three stacked tables with two tea tables stacked on top. I went on stage and performed a few sets of sword and spear routines. Although I felt a little dizzy and lightheaded, I finally climbed to the highest point as usual, supported my waist with both hands, and bent my head backwards... In that instant, I immediately realized my danger. Everything went dark, my head felt heavy, and with a sudden loud noise, countless sparks flashed before my eyes, and then I knew nothing."</p>
<p>"I woke up in a hospital. When I opened my eyes, I immediately saw that everything had changed, it was so blurry and dark. When I realized that I had become disabled – I had broken an eyeball – I was so sad and cried... I wished I could die immediately. I understood that my appearance was ruined, and my life was also extinguished."</p>
<p>"Alas," she sighed deeply. "I walked out of the hospital with only one eye, and no one recognized me anymore. My fate was decided in this way, to wander and sing on the streets forever."</p>
<p>"Alas, so pitiful," everyone sighed.</p>
<p>She sat silently for a while, then lazily stood up and yawned.</p>
<p>At this moment, her face was facing my window, and suddenly I saw a white eyeball with a network of blood vessels protruding from below her right eyebrow, appearing extremely frightening.</p>
<p>She slowly picked up her erhu, touched her hair again, said "Goodbye" to everyone, and then walked out of the alley, playing a meandering tune.</p>
