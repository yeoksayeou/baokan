<h3>國聯行政會通過决議案</h3>
<p>日本聲明决議案不能阻止勦匪行動</p>
<p>京各校學生萬餘人昨日舉行大請願</p>
<h3>國聯行政會昨開末次大會</h3>
<p>施肇基卒接受决議案</p>
<p>芳澤對第二節有聲明</p>
<p>美代表道威斯未列席</p>
<p>（巴黎）國聯理事會今日下午四時四十五分召集最後公開大會、我國施總代表接受决議案、日總代表芳澤亦接受决議案、但仍聲明决議案内第二節不能阻止日軍之剿匪行動、最後此决議案遂由全體理事一致通過</p>
<p>（十日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）我國總代表施肇基博士今日在理事會公開大會宣稱、中國政府對於同意此决議案、及照主席解釋後所生之義務欲踐行勿爽、但必須有完全可行之辦法、以應付緊急情勢、爲求完全諒解計、請將余若干見解與保留登入記事錄（一）中國必須完全保留按照國聯會章各欵及所簽各公約與國際公約在法律地位上種種救濟之一應權利、（二）决議案及主席宣言所表現之目前辦法、中國認爲一種可行方法、内有四要點（甲）立即停止敵對行動、（乙）在可能的最短時期完全撤銷日本之佔領滿洲狀態、（丙）中立視察員監視並將此後一切發展、報告理事會、（丁）理事會派委員赴當地大規模調查東三省全部情形、倘有一點未能照行、則此辦法將失效、又謂關於第三節、中國在一種諒解下接受、即期望調查團抵遼時、倘日軍猶未撤盡、則該團將視調查報告及建議日軍之撤退爲第任務、關於第四節、不影響中國及其人民要求損害賠償之權、關於第五節、不得藉口現有之不靖狀况、而違犯該節規定、因此種不靖爲日軍侵犯所致、（十日國民社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）日總代表芳澤今日在理事會公開大會接受决議案時宣稱、關於該案第二節、余今日欣然代表日政府在該節無意妨阻日軍爲直接保護東三省各地日僑生命財產、而取必要行動之諒解下謹行接受、（十日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）國聯理事會公開大會、原定今日下午四時半開會、因美大使道威斯於四時十分到法外部、與白里安有重要商榷、遂展延十五分鐘、於四時三刻開會、初料道威斯或將列席理事會、故會議桌旁曾加添一椅、頓時外間紛傳道氏將列席會議、但至開會後、此第十六把交席仍空無人坐、蓋道氏守美政府之誠、不欲正式列席也、（十日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）今日下午理事會舉行公開大會時、中國代表團久經鬱積之情感、將可略爲發洩、但各方刻正用非常之壓力、加諸我施總代表、使勿發若輩所認爲苦痛之宣言、而同時亦壓迫日代表芳澤、勿再當衆聲明勦匪權利、現施氏業在今晨十一時四十五分訪美大使道威斯時、將宣言稿錄副送交道氏、施道談話之際、國聯總秘書德魯蒙亦在塲、據其事後形容此次談話、稱爲最爲複雜、施氏於晤道氏後、</p>
<p>、十二時三十分即與中代表團法律顧問奥爾慈詳細準酌宣言字句、及其法律立塲、嗣德魯蒙即將施氏談話情形報告理事會、據稱、道氏曾詢施總代表、中國對於撤退錦州附近軍隊一層、願撤至何種程度施氏堅决拒絶、現料道氏將邀日代表芳澤加以勸說、冀得一折衷辦法、又理事會於聞悉日代表團所接最後訓令後、十二國代表即於今晨十　時四十五分舉行秘密會議、研究日本地位、考慮應付理事會最新危機之方法、其時日代表芳澤所擬宣言稿、亦已由伊籐送交德魯蒙轉致白里安、當由白氏當塲宣讀、聞日方宣言内着重於勦匪權利、未言及設立錦州中立區、但經十二理事縝密討論至十二時五十五分散會時、仍未有樂觀景象、現中日雙方之宣言旣絶相反對、而中代表亦將繼芳澤宣言後、一吐因白里安懇求而久經抑遏之情感、故料今日下午之公開大會、將見非常活躍、惟十二理事此時正盡力壓迫芳澤、勸其取消勦匪聲明、謂若日本要求在中國領土内有警權、各小國理事定將加以批准、而中國施總代表亦將聲明日本之在滿洲勦匪、違犯國際公法、於日本未必有利、惟日人之能否善納忠言、尚待事實之徵實也、又照理事會目下計劃、下午四時三十分舉行公開大會之後、將再開秘密會議一次、屆時或即可以商定調查委員之人選、現料各理事將請白里安向委員團内有代表之各該政府薦舉相當人物、又聞美籍委員藉此間現正商榷擬以菲島總督台維斯充任、惟此間雖稱台氏爲卸任總督、而美官塲則鄭重聲明、台氏僅在假中仍係菲島行政長官云、（十日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）行政會十二會員今晨集議、考慮關於日本在滿勦匪權保留案之文字、此保留案係芳澤奉幣原外相之訓令而提出者、行政會覺欲得一種方案、旣可使日本滿意、又可不成立在滿洲發生惡果之前例者、殊屬不易、行政會有數會員現且反對許一國在非其所有之土地内有剿匪自由權之原則、因此種原則、將在馬其頓及歐洲他處之政治關係與法紀與秩序發生衝突者之無窮糾紛、故行政會或有數會員將對於此事發表批評也、（十日路透社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）日代表芳澤所擬在公開大會之宣言關於决議案第二節之聲明、原爲此節不屏除日本剿除盗匪以保護在滿日僑生命財產之權利、嗣各理事爲使小國滿意起見、力勸加入此項權利、爲滿洲特殊局勢所必要之例外手段一語（十日國民社電）</p>
<h3>性質空泛之决議草案全文</h3>
<p>主席逐條加以說明</p>
<p>具體各點悉已删去</p>
<p>所謂剿匪權未提及</p>
<p>（巴黎）公開的行政會會議、今日午後五時舉行、閱五十五分鐘、延會至明日午後四時、因芳澤自稱尚未接到東京訓令故請求延會也、行政會熟思慎慮、性質延宕、民衆對於行政會進行之注意、乃大減淡、今日午後集於外部門外注視各代表之蒞會者、竟無多人、較諸最初數次開大會時、羣衆擁擠情形、大相差異、施博士入鐘室之外室時、與芳澤握手、狀似友好、後與德代表穆狄斯談話、至開會時而後止、此次未見芳澤吸其著名雪茄、鐘鳴五下、白里安就席、意代表謝樂嘉坐其右、國聯秘書長德魯蒙坐其左、逾三分鐘、主席宣佈開會、因歐戰發作時意相薩倫德拉今晨在羅馬逝世、主席致詞悼之、謝樂嘉代表意政府答詞致謝、並謂渠亦年老、不久將繼薩倫德拉而去、苟爲先渠而去之良友所歡迎、當亦欣然、屆時若白里安能臨穴而發追悼詞、尤所望也、白里安聞言摇首、兩目下垂、露憊倦態、向隣座耳語、言及其新近逝世之摯友洛歇爾旋起立以其淸晣聲音宣讀行政會草議案之原文如下、</p>
<p>（一）重行確定一九三一年九月三十日行政會一致通過之决議案、依此議案、雙方聲明受其莊嚴拘束、故現請中日兩政府採行爲確使此議案見諸實施所必要之各種方法、庶日兵之撤入鐵路區域、於該議案所規定之條欵下儘速實現、</p>
<p>（二）行政會念及十月二十四日行政會集議以來、時事有更嚴重之景象、乃紀錄雙方採行各種必要計畫、以避免使時局愈臻嚴重、及不作可引起此後戰爭及生命喪失的任何發動之擔任、</p>
<p>（三）行政會請雙方繼續將時局之發展情形、告知行政會、</p>
<p>（四）行政會請行政會其他會員、將所接其當地代表之任何情報供給行政會、</p>
<p>（五）行政會鑒於此案之特殊情形、欲促成兩國對於其所爭問題作最後與根本上之解决、而無礙於上述計畫之實行、乃决定指派五人委員團就地考察、而向行政會報告妨及國際關係及危害中日間和平或兩國間和平所賴的良好諒解之任何情形、中日政府各有權指定一陪員襄助此委不欲廢棄之、西門又稱、現有英法德意美員團、兩政府對此委員團將予以各種便利、俾就地獲取其所需要之任何情報、現所了解者、如雙方發動任何談判、則此談判不歸入此委員團職權範圍之内、而委員團亦無干涉任何一方軍事佈置之資格、此委員會之指派與考量、毫不礙及日政府在九月三十日議案中所給關於日軍撤回鐵路區域之諒解、</p>
<p>（六）行政會始終注意此事、在目前與明年一月二十五日下屆尋常會期間之時期中、請議長留意此問題、而於必要時再召集之、</p>
<p>議長白里安在其說明文中、謂本議案規定兩個行動方針、第一爲終止目前危及和平之舉動、第二爲便利爭點中現有原因之最後解决、行政會在目前集會中、欣悉何方皆贊同調查可擾亂中日關係之情形、故歡迎十一月二十一日在行政會提出設立委員團之建議、本議案之最後一段、規定此委員團之成立與職務云、</p>
<p>白里安旋批評議案各段、謂第一段一再確定十月三十日之議案、尤注重日軍於該議案條欵下儘速撤回鐵路區域事、行政會極重視此案、甚望兩政府設法完成其九月三十日擔任之履行白里安言及第二段、謂不幸自行政會上次會期後、事件發生增大、時局嚴重而引起應有之惶慮、雙方亟宜勿採行可釀成以後戰事之任何發動、及可使事態擴大之各種其他行爲、除中日外、行政會會員在第四段下將與雙方接觸、庶雙方於願意時可向會員指示其願會員派往其代表之地點、白里安繼言及議案第五段、謂委員團職務頗廣、限於顧問性質委員團可研究凡可擾亂中日間和平或良好諒解者之各種問題、中日各有權將其願得委員團研究之任何問題、請委員團考慮云、委員團有完全自行斟酌權、以决定其向行政會報告之問題、並有權於需要時繕發臨時報告、如雙方在九月三十日議案下所發之擔任、在委員團到時、尚未履行、委員會應即將此時局報告行政會、此段特别規定者、如雙方發動談判、此事不歸入委員團職權範圍、而干涉任何一方之軍事佈置、亦不在委員團資格之内、但後項規定、並不限制委員團調查職權、再、委員團享有完全自由行動權、庶可獲其所欲得之任何情報云、（九日路透社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）决議草案及主席說明文、其與本日在行政會提出朗讀者、不無異同之點（一）决議案第五節、因日本表示希望結果、已移入說明文内、此節原文「調查團到達滿洲之際、若撤兵一事尚未完成、該團應即提出報告云云」當被删去、而說明第一節原文、「外國軍隊駐在中國領土、實造成一種反常局勢云云」亦已删去（二）宣言第二節原文、關於勦匪問題「但有一點必須辨明者云云」一段、全被删去、即關於警察職權全文、亦已删去、行政會因此與芳澤磋商頗費辱舌、芳澤之意、欲以日本片面宣言代之、致引起行政院之異議、迄至最後時間尚未决定、但各方面均可接受之方式或可覓得（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（東京）此間接倫敦消息、謂英外相西門昨在下院宣布國聯調查委員團調查範圍以東三省爲限云云、衆多訝異、蓋决議草案第五段固明白規定在中國調查、此爲日本所恒主張之點也（查路透社所接决議案原文之第五段、僅言就地考察、並無中國字樣）（十日路透電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>剿匪與保僑</h3>
<p>國際聯盟之眞實面目自九一八以來即已明白顯呈於世人之眼前盟約爲欺騙弱國之符咒。聯盟爲大而無當之紙老虎。而所謂公理與和平。則更適爲愚人之幻夢。在今日而對國聯尚存若何維護公理與和平之希冀與期望者。當爲世界最笨最騃之愚人。</p>
<p>國聯自三次集會以來。其袒日抑我之行爲。吾人已於歷次評論中予以申述。抑且吾人對於國聯早已絶望。早已料知其無能爲。我國如欲救亡。必反求諸已力。故對於九日國聯公開會議中所提出之决議草案六欵。以及白里安氏之解釋宣言。不欲再加以若何之批判。蓋國聯今日之所爲。不過欲覓取敷衍下台之途徑。所謂六欵决議草案。皆不痛不癢。一則曰「中日兩政府履行一切必要之手段。」再則曰「兩方負責採取一切必要方法以避免對現况愈增嚴重。」一若九一八之慘局。與目前暴日侵我之嚴重情勢。我國亦應負若何之責任者。而同時於撤退日軍一最大問題。則僅以「在可能的最短時期中完成之」一語以敷衍。仍無具體期限之規定。於調查團之職權一問題。更明白指定「不過問兩方開始任何交涉。不干涉任何一方之軍事行動。」其爲顯明的屈就日方。以敷衍維持其下台之顔面。蓋昭然若揭。吾人對此。固尚能作何言。獨是如白里安氏之宣言。雖未明白提及日本之所謂剿匪權利。而公然承認日有保僑權利。其以變形不變質之主張。順從日人之要求。公然欺騙世界。則吾人不能不嚴詞予以揭穿。</p>
<p>夫日本之所以提出保留剿匪權利者。其眞實之用意所在。無非欲藉剿匪之名。以隨時挑起釁端。隨時進兵。隨時復演九一八之暴行耳。在日人之心目中。凡中國之人民皆匪。皆無不應剿。就令無匪。而九一八故意自毁路軌架詞誣陷之手段。以及收買張海鵬之流。嗾其搗亂。以爲進兵口實之陰謀。又何嘗不可作再次之實行。其欲藉剿匪之名。以繼續擴大其暴行之實而已。不然在中國領土之内。主權神聖。何預日人。而齗齗以剿匪權利相爭辯。國聯旣不能揭破其陰謀。前且公然宣稱其主張之有理。茲雖對於此一提議未明白提及。而竟代以變相之不限地域之保僑權利。是說果確。國聯固已順受日方之提議矣。而尚欲以變相之主張。公然欺騙世界。斯眞虚僞之尤者矣。　　夫日軍撤退。保護日僑之責自可由中國完全擔負。中國固已歷次聲明。可負保護外僑之安全之全責矣。就事實言。九一八以後。日僑在中國亦並無若何危險之可慮。而且中國沿海沿江各埠。今日固已有聲言保僑之日艦寗佈。何必更作危辭。鄭重聲稱必有保僑之權利。更有進者。日本商民徧我國内。若每一日僑而必隨有數名之武裝保鏢。則世界無此惡例。在保僑權利之下。日軍即可派遣軍隊。分佈中國全境。更可在或種陰謀之下實施「爲保僑而取正當自衛」之一貫的手段之實。是即在中國全境無處不可隨時引起禍變。無處不可隨時引起九一八同樣之慘劇。「保僑保僑。」無窮之禍變。兹後其將在兩字之下孕育而出矣、</p>
<p>何况在事實之另一面。日人近更積極作攻錦之準備日方之毫無和平誠意。蓋爲世人所能灼知。國聯夫豈見不及此。特亦屈於强暴。而自身又適爲强權之代表者。故終不能有公平之處置乎。然則我國今日之尚對此木偶禱祝不已者。其殆冀以愚人之愚忱。動國聯最後之哀憫耶。</p>

<p>（上略）今吾黨之糾紛、已至再無可以延長之時、政治日非、已至再無可以苟安之日、而國難日殷、亦已至再無可以諉卸責任之境、故全黨同志必須於目前下一大改革之决心、將黨内之糾紛與失當之政制、同時謀根本之解决、始足以紓當前之國難、然謀根本之解决、則必悉反吾黨數年來之所爲、而力矯其的詳言之、即吾黨過去分裂之史跡、今後必須一反而爲團結之歷史、過去以軍握政以政握黨之故轍、今後必須反而爲以黨訓政以政治軍之坦途、吾黨所以救國難於當前、固决於是、所以完成總理遺敎於來日、亦繫於是、兹當吾黨大團結之際、謹將吾人在過去和平奮鬥中、所確認爲黨政軍三方面必要之改革、分述如左、</p>
<p>一·爲求達到本黨實行國民革命之目的、吾黨同志、今後必須以總理遺敎爲意志、統一精神團結之中心、尤須本總理天下爲公之精神矯正黨内之組織、與其所用之方法、消弭黨内一切鬥爭、使黨確實成爲强大有力之革命集團、以率領國民實行三民主義之建設、</p>
<p>二·凡關於黨政之重大糾紛、非開中央執行委員會全體會議、有委員三分二以上之出席、及出席委員無記名表决三分二以上之可决、不得以兵力解决之、必如此、始足以免除過去輕啓内戰之禍端、而闢今後政治和平進展之途徑、</p>
<p>三·於第四屆中央執行委員會第一次全體會議根據雙方第四次全國代表大會之議案、確定今後本黨整理之具體計劃、並依據建國大綱、斟酌實際情形、修正國民政府組織法、改組國民政府、</p>
<p>四·爲求國民政府能切實對黨負責、實行主義政綱、必須依據最近上海和會所議中央政制改革案之原則、使五院能獨立負責、行使職權、以實現五權制度之精神、同時必須使政治制度系統一貫、組織簡捷、職權確定、責任分明、以期增加政治上之效能、</p>
<p>五·中央政治機關、應參加民選份子、使政府與人民切實合作、以期民權日漸發展、循序達到憲政之目的、</p>
<p>六·訓政時期之首要任務、在完成地方自治、使國民獲得行使政權之訓練、以循序參預中央政事、建立民主政治之基礎、至於人民權利、如身體居住營業旨論出版結社集會等之自由、尤當以法律爲之保障、</p>
<p>七·爲求國家之和平發展、必須使武力受政治之支配、而爲扶植民權與充實國防之保障、其原則爲軍權必須决之於黨、而由政府負責執行、軍政隷於行政院、軍法及軍需均須獨立、並於全國設置軍區、其區域不必同於行政區域之劃分、而使國防隷於中央、保安屬之地方、以防軍人干預國家行政之患、</p>
<p>八·財政必須公開、使政府及人民經濟團體得以共同整理財政、審核預算决算、監理内外債及中央與地方之收支、凡軍費之提供與負担、須以國防保安勦匪之用途爲限、而不得濫耗之於内戰、九·今後一切建設、必須依據總理遺敎、及第一次全國代表大會之政綱政策、其未行者、努力斵其實行、其已行而實施之方法錯誤者、予以糾正、</p>
<p>十·外交政策必須秉總理遺敎、實現廢除不平等條約及打倒帝國主義之目的、以期恢復民族之自由、完成我國家之獨立、此次東三省邊患發生、政府與官吏舉措失當、遂致日本帝國主義益形猖厥、今後補救、必須依照總理外交政策之遺訓、斟酌國際公約及國際機關所可據爲資援之種種情况、確立外交方針、進行正當於雪恥自衛之工作、務使暴日屈伏於正義、以達我國恢復主權保全領土之目的而後已</p>
<p>以上十端、深信爲改革内政之必要政策、亦爲救濟時艱之急要方法、若能立見實行、則其他敎育經濟社會文化諸端之改進、方能有所藉手、蓋非如此、不惟不足以謀本黨之團结、符國民之責望、抑且不足以繼承總理之遺志、賡續三民主義建國之大業、自兹以往、吾黨同志、黨據此而泯除以往之成見、團結今後一心一德之精神、以期同爲國家服忠實之義務、全國國民、亦當據此而消除頻年之内戰、永奠國家眞實之和平與統一、庶幾同心努力、靖大難於今日、上下輯塍、　福利於無窮、我全體同志、全國同胞、願共勉之、謹此實言、</p>

<h3>女籃球錦標大定兩江保持甲組</h3>
<p>三十四比十八劇戰勝東南</p>
<p>乙組强東二十比九勝江江</p>
<p>久呈冷寂之中華籃球房、昨晚又狂熱一時、關緊錦標之兩塲上海女子籃球會决賽、結果甲組兩江以三十四比十八勝東南、苦戰至最後一節、東南才敗、乙組强東以二址比九分勝江江、甲乙兩組之錦標、歸兩江及强東、遂爾大定、尚有乙組一塲大夏大九比十一分勝兩兩、</p>
<p>乙組冠軍將歸强東</p>
<p>强東江江首先接觸、各以四戰四勝資格决戰、强東結果以二十比九打敗强敵、乙組錦極從此决定、裁判陸翔千、</p>
<p>一路順風　開塲五分鐘、雙方攻守俱嚴烈、不分勝負、江江商淑貞罰中一分、强東章哲君投入一球、商再罰中、第一節二分比二分、此後强東以佳美聯絡、嚴密看守、遂一路順風、江江則一籌莫展、</p>
<p>强東固强　名副其實、强東的確强固、前鋒之傳球、已合乎法、惟出手甚嫌其慢、失去機會不少、章哲君姿式甚屬可觀、後衛之强、江江因之裹足、松江名將陸雪琴、身長玉立、球多爲其機得、表演亦屬最佳也、</p>
<p>强東　犯規　得分▲江江　犯規　得分</p>

<p>甲組錦標兩江保持</p>
<p>大東兩兩之後、甲組開始决賽、兩江於最後一節才大破東南、三十四比十八獲勝、甲組錦標、又將保持一年、裁判周家騏</p>
<p>出意料兩江逢勁敵各前預料當以兩江佔勝爲多、决不知有若是劇戰、東南球藝已與日俱增、活潑敏捷、在在動人、兩江苦戰三節、難解難分、最後才急轉直下、東南敎練爲中大名將張元生、將門自當出將才、奪兩江主席、恐時間問題耳、</p>
<p>上半局難能分勝負　上場東南以三比零煊赫居先邵錦英二球、一分超出、第一節互相一分上下、形勢嚴重、觀者息心靜氣、兩江僅以八比七僅一分、上半時終結、兩江仍僅十六比十二勝四分、</p>
<p>下半局急轉而直下　東南王乃新緊緊看住邵錦英、邵雖每擲必中、機會絶少、再戰之初、東南曾追成十八比十六、王一鬆邵遂接連中的席均又入網、形勢遂一落千丈、東南無法挽救、</p>
<p>邵錦英兩江之臺柱　兩江得勝邵錦英一人而已、擲籃之神妙、男子中亦罕見一人獨得念四分、設無邵早成敗將矣、席均已大減色、萬蓉欠活潑、後衛莊王之外、尚缺一人、</p>
<p>王乃新後衛之良材　更惹人注目爲東南後衛大將王乃新、穩固嚴密、一時無兩位置之適當合宜、全場獨一、東南全隊、人才十分平均、胡劉二衛、亦屬可取、前鋒身材欠高、吃虧不少、聯絡已臻美境、擲籃則尚欠準確也</p>

<p>西靑籃球賽、昨共有二組甲組比賽、前一組高下懸殊、後一組勢均力敵、比賽經過如後、</p>
<p>麥令勝夏光（甲組）　夏光陣綫殘缺（前鋒任傑星臂傷休養）實力减色、最初五分鐘、</p>
<p>雙方虎視眈眈、各不相下、人不犯我、我不犯人、</p>
<p>麥令勞意一球、戰禍遂開、反顧之際、陳寳球關擋安各中一球、自後逐出然從此氣燄頓減、關壘累告失守、上半時十一比二十六落後、下半時麥令馬合首開紀錄、一路領導、大夏雄師無法進展、結果二十八比四十二失敗、裁判勃拉脫、</p>
<p>曁南勝靑光（甲組）　曁南先下毒手、射中二球、靑光後隨、相差極微、各得十分之後、形勢改轉、靑光領導而曁南居後、上半時告終、雙方適各獲二十分、再戰聲中、靑光初以二十六比二十一占先、不久、曁南扶摇直上、每投多中、同時靑光如遇惡運、累遭閉門羹、曁南於三二比三十之後、大形活動、攻守如意、結果四十二比三十一勝、裁判邵驥</p>

<h3>玳梁憶語</h3>
<p>— 燕子</p>
<p>歷朝外患叢集。漢有匈奴。唐有高麗。宋有遼金。明有倭寇。沿海一帶。受倭寇之蹂躪。始於洪武初年。太祖命湯和駐重兵於海角。以防倭寇之侵佔。奈防綫延長數百里之遥。雖有重兵。頗難佈置。湯乃竭盡心力。沿海建築鋒火墩一各三百五十三座。派兵守墩瞭望。遇倭船傍灘登岸。舉火爲號。互相馳援。然猶恐兵力未遠。更招漁人。組漁團以訓練之。歷年禦倭有功。烽烟稍靖。比及嘉靖初葉。倭寇又圖刧掠。朝旨命戚繼光練兵禦倭。</p>
<p>蕭規曹隨。悉遵湯和之擘劃。而繼續施行。其得力於漁團者非鮮。漁團中有廖氏弟兄者。善水性。伏處水底。能張目視物、泊舟於蘆葦深處。以逸待勞。倭宼駕巨艦揚帆東下、廖氏弟兄躍入海中。潛伏艦徊。持錐洞其艦底沉巨艦十餘艘。倭酋慌亂欲遁。全隊失措。漁舟四集邀擊。倭寇墜海而死百餘人。水軍聞警來援。斬獲無算、倭艦如鳥獸散。自此一戰而捷。四十年中。倭寇遂不敢越雷池一步矣。戚乃歸功於漁團。而鋪陳戰績奏之朝。奉旨編入水軍。以鎭海角。漁團之威名。馳於中外。故鄉父老。至今稱道勿衰焉。</p>

<h3>一個敎師與家長的答復丨出頭處要自由！</h3>
<p>南京八日專電載有戴傳賢於本月七日給全國敎育家及學生家長的一封公開信，上面寫的是：</p>
<p>「培植出一根樹苗，要他長成端正的大樹，要費幾根大木頭，四而撑住他。培植一個好靑年，要犧牲幾個成年人，四面去扶植他。樹苗自由，不能成長，靑年自由，不能成人。全國的敎育家醒來！全國學生的父母兄弟姊妹醒來！救國先救國家命根的靑年！救國先救敎導靑年的學校！我雖當不起敎育家這個名詞但是一個當過十幾年敎師的人，總該跟着諸位敎育家共聽戴君之敎益。我並且是幾個小孩子的父親，更應負起責任來發表我的見解。在戴君大聲疾呼之下，我是醒了，想睡也睡不着了。我於是先把戴君的信介紹給孩子們看，然後對他們發表我的意見，誰是誰非，讓他們自己判斷吧。我對他們所說的話是：</p>
<p>「你們要知道種樹嗎？底下可以安根，上面可以出頭，幼苗纔能種得活。有水分，肥料，空氣，陽光，而無蟲害，幼苗纔能長成大樹。園中的責任在灌溉，施肥，除害蟲而不没收它的自由的空氣與陽光。則幼苗自能欣欣向榮了。花園裏給人玩賞的樹木四面是有死木頭撑住，並有繩子把它們紮成種種曲線美。這些是樹少爺，因爲有樹聽差服侍它們；有的是樹小姐因爲它們裹脚束腰和人間不自尊的姑娘大同小異。樹少爺，樹小姐只是人的玩物，這中間找不出棟梁材。棟梁材是長在森林裏。興安嶺的幼樹可以樹聽差服侍？誰見過它們裹過脚束過腰？如果你想呌幼苗端端正正的長起來，也難也容易。小樹生在大樹中間，若大樹端正，則小樹須向上吸收陽光，自必端正，這不是很容易嗎？若大樹慣於折腰，罩在小樹上，小樹得不着陽光，想它端正便是萬難。所以</p>
<p>出頭處要自由</p>
<p>樹苗要伸出頭來呼吸自由的空氣，感受自由的陽先能端正。假使我們在幼苗的出頭處加以壓力，那末除非是幼苗肯像烏龜樣把頭縮進殻裏去，它的自然的生長力是會把壓力衝破，如同小雞啄破雞蛋殻出世一樣的不可制止。</p>
<h3>南通倭子墳</h3>
<p>— 睡麟</p>
<p>南通城外有倭子墳二。係明季倭寇時向我國沿海各地侵擾。南通爲通海大埠。故亦爲侵擾之的。披輩嘗千百成羣。航海而來。一登岸。逢人便殺。遇屋即焚。追逐數十里。飽掠而歸。通人初疑爲近境之海盗。故不知爲倭宼也。是後習以爲常。歲必一兩至。積久始知爲倭寇。通人若之。遂設防以禦。逮至寇復入境邊。近鄉人。仍望風逃竄。寇自長驅追逐。左右兩翼之民團。抄出其後路。盡沉其舟。官軍復迎頭痛擊。寇等因偶逢强敵。敗歸舟際。而退路已斷。遂全數被殲。無一生還。聚尸而葬。名曰倭子之墳。次年又來一次。通人復如前禦之。又全數被殲。復共葬一墳。自此兩次失敗。寇跡遂絶。其墳傳至現今。每逢情明寒食。通人咸以紙錢麥飯祭之。蓋憫其異國孤魂。已不復記及焚殺之仇矣。其墳之大。異地人見之。多誤爲小丘。不知爲倭子墳也。現南通博物院尚存有彼時倭寇所遺之兵器甲胄甚夥。供人憑弔焉。</p>
<p>自日本維新之後。我國海禁開通。該邦來游者。見南通之舊跡。無不恥之。欲商諸通人。毁其墳而收其器。通人不可。彼亦無可如何也。</p>
<p>倭寇擾邊之舊跡。不獨南通有之。浙江沿海各地甚多。第不若南通之著耳。各地禦寇之道。祇殲其入境者。從未聞有大批</p>
<p>軍隊。開入日境以尋仇者。蓋日人先天禀負。脈絡中含有侵掠之血素。和平仁厚。非該邦字典中所有之文字。現又不宣而戰。入據我東北。仍未脫其野蠻之天性也</p>

<h3>北站印象記</h3>
<p>— 魯顰</p>
<p>國國難聲中。予兩往北站。第一次上海各大學請願團晉京請願。予往站歡送。睹六千靑年。集隊月台。著制服列隊靜息。秩序井然。竊嘗思果有此六千健兒。出發東北。到前敵殺虜衛國。京滬站上。又將如何之悲壯。昨日下午。予再至北站。送自動援馬團出發。前此之幻覺。今成事實。於敬佩之外。不勝自愧。爰書印象。以留鴻爪。待我同志奏凱歸來。於光榮史上充補白。</p>
<h3>睇嚮齋逞談</h3>
<p>— 甘簃</p>
<p>岑春萱（上）</p>
<p>岑春萱隱於滬上將十年。年逾七十。若與世忘。世人亦遂忘之久矣。春萱。字雲階。其先固浙藉。祖宦於粤西。遂爲西林人。舉於鄉。納粟爲部曹。以父毓英官至雲貴總督。及卒。例邀卹典。春萱得五品京堂候補。旋授太僕寺少卿。甲午中日之戰。春萱憤請從戎。旨交江督劉坤一差遣。春萱以京卿高貴。不應受疆吏指揮。頗有微辭。顧視坤一行止爲進退。坤一審前方戰不利。托故遲遲其行。春萱一腔熱血。無地可灑。和議旣定。有以春萱才大膽壯薦諸朝者。獲簡廣東布政使。論事輒與制府譂鍾麟齟齬。春萱疏劾之。鍾麟竟因此被黜。萱亦移甘肅。藩司彈罷總督。罕見也。拳匪亂作。那拉后光緒帝離宫西幸。春萱得報。乞總督陶模以兵資之。謂將軍率師勤王。模曰。此忠臣義士之所爲也。立遣巡防兵若干營改編成軍。使统制焉。軍在塗。后帝狼狽過境。春萱跪地垂涕。道拳匪禍國殃民之罪。兩宫蒙塵之痛。願任護駕責。后大哭。帝亦哭。后曰。有若在。予母子何憂何懼。抵西安。春萱夜寢於行在。儻聞人語或聲響。春萱必大呼曰。臣某在此。后耳其音而泣下。擢陜撫。微示酬庸意。已而。移撫山石。復晋督巴蜀。春萱爲政猛。治事嚴。屬吏不法者。莫不懲之。後移粤督。於用人行政。仍臨之以威。繩之以法。嘗於廣西獲盗魁。剖腹取血貯杯中。目桂撫柯逢時曰。中丞請先嘗之。盗血之味。有别於良民之血之味否。逢時橋舌不下。春萱舉杯一飮而盡。逢時驚失色。曰。制軍雅量。固異常人也。春萱旣爲后所喜。權勢益盛。累疏劾慶親王奕劻昏庸誤國。賄賂肥私。直督袁世凱結黨練兵。弄權干政。劻與世凱大恐。它大臣俱人人自危。羣起揭其短。后不獲已。調督雲貴。雲貴遠處邊陲。政簡地瘦。春萱得旨怏怏。疏請入覲白事。后知其將有所敷陳。許之。旣抵京。后召入見。春萱伏地哭失聲。歷數奕劻世凱樹黨誤國狀。后太息曰。奕劻齒高爵崇。吾且優容之。汝亦宜善處。世凱功冠羣臣。權爲怨府。同膺疆寄。可稍忍涵。春萱曁退。后亟召劻入。曰。岑三性剛烈。有爲政之才。無容人之量。劾汝不能議其非。予已温言舒其憤懣不平之氣。將置九卿之列。使其翊贊中樞。一旦同朝。允宜和衷共濟。扶持艱危之局。傾軋之風自息。劻唯唯。退而詣春萱所。詢兩粤民情致象。語婉意誠。翌日遣使饋珍饌。更示親近憲。聞者以劻之紆尊屈駕爲異。蓋后雖未明言。隱實使之交歡。而劻之機警。於是覘之矣。顧春萱吃然不爲動。每入對。必訴劻劣蹟於后。舉朝側目。</p>
<p>出發之前。有訣别之會。所謂抱必死之心以去也。宣傳家吳邁曁北平某交際花皆往參加。慷慨陳辭。感人頗深。當時有拍賣衣帽。捐充該團經費者。人心尚未死。於此益信。</p>
<p>團員皆着單軍服。英氣逼人。有女團員數人。衣着亦如男子。前日字林西報對宋美奇女士在京投軍之新聞。標題譽爲中國之貞德。但於靑年援馬團。則中國之貞德固不祗一二人也。不知我十里洋塲中醉生夢死之靑年。靜夜捫心。能不愧死。　　有某團員　新婚燕爾。某君持帽向其嬌妻告别。漫語「爾在滬好自爲之。吾行矣。言已即轉身入隊。夫人聞言。淚涔涔下。更有某團員之母。亦往訣别。滿面淚痕。心已碎矣。兹數君能别妻離母而赴國離。人格之偉大。至足動人。故樂爲之記。</p>

<h3>與子同仇（八）</h3>
<p>— 顧明道</p>
<p>第二章　志同道合</p>
<p>忠淑的母親早已棄養。梅國擁着許多姬妾。忠淑因此也難得回T城去的。反是伊父親時時遣人送金錢和食物與伊。伊在校中朝夕用功。對於太陽國的侵略主義。覺得咄咄逼入。非常可畏。北有封豕。南有長蛇。M洲要避免危亡。非得自强不可。同學中和伊最談得合意的便是華乃强。所以二人形蹤較密。伊的一顆芳心中覺得華乃强是個少年俊傑之士。道德學問技術三者。都値得令人景仰。華乃强宛如一塊磁石。忠淑好似一枚鐵針。自然而然地被他吸引得去。而華乃强對於忠淑。知道伊是一位巾幗英雄。出言吐詞。均有愛國思想。非尋常女子可比。難得伊能加以靑眼。自然引爲知己。况且華乃强是個孤兒。又無弟兄姊妹。孑然一身。形單影隻。有此素心人晨夕與共。足慰孤寂。二人的情感自然格外濃厚了。有一次薰風炙人。正逢暑假。忠淑因有些事情要回T城去。華乃强是無家可歸。常年住在校裏的。忠淑問他可願意到T城去一遊。順便到伊家中盤桓數天。華乃强左右無事。一口允諾。遂整理行篋。帶了許多常看的書。伴着忠淑一同到得T城。忠淑便引華乃强去見伊父親。梅國知是他女兒的同學。自然欵留。暇時和他談談。華乃强覺得梅國聲色貨利是貪。胸中一些没有學識。性情獷悍。這種軍人斷不能爲國效力的。談到太陽國的事。更是一切隔膜。畏蜀如虎。還有什麽正當的話可和他講呢。天天見他喫酒作樂而已最使他不耐的梅國有一個五姨太太。平日常陪他喝酒的。一在不知爲了何事。得罪了他。惱得梅國禽獸性起。提了馬鞭子。把那姨太太周身上下抽了一頓。打得伊在地下亂滚。哀哀哭泣。但是梅國怒氣未息。拉出手槍要想結果伊的性命。幸虧忠淑過來解勸。然而那姨太太已是遍體鱗傷了。華乃强瞧得很是悶氣。依着他的性子。早要上前解圍。且要數說梅國太無人道。祗因自己是客。又碍着忠淑的面子只好佯作不見不聞。</p>

<p>自海開禁止現欵出口後、經銀錢兩業及報關公會紛紛具函證明去胃之用途、並非轉售日人、但其間亦難免無奸商偷售情事、故有關係之各業、另組有糾察隊、隨時查察勸阻、以符救國本旨、查目前仍有少數金融界裝赴烟台營口各埠之現銀及現洋、自本星期一、迄昨日止已達二百萬强弱、致引起各界之注意、惟其間確有公會方面證明、係調劑市面者、然此種販現出口之營業、即有厚利可圖、還是暫停裝運、免受外界疑忌、至於銀行如果確係正用、經證明不得不裝者、究屬少數耳、</p>
<h3>證劵債市仍極呆滯</h3>
<p>稍有漲跌市况淸閒　　昨（十日）華商證劵交易所各債市况、現貨進出不寂、前後市成交三萬九千元、期市依然不振、大户進出微細、其閒散情形、仍與前同、上午兩盤交易約有二百萬元、後市一盤祇一百十餘萬元、合計三百十三萬元、至言各債趨勢、愈呈呆滯、各盤間徘徊而無大變化、蓋國内外局勢沉悶、國聯對東北問題、處置無方、有即將棄置開會之訉、故今後中日之形勢、甚堪玩味、而兩方猶維持現狀、尚少新發展也、因是市上大户觀望、除零星交易外、絶鮮鉅額成交、遂致求供形勢益平、上落甚微、陷於盤旋將態中、各債價以晨初爲較堅、旋稍回疲、結果除裁兵現貨漲一元七角、二○關現貨漲八角外、其他互有漲跌、爲數亦祇數角、觀證劵市之形勢、似暫時不致有漲落云、</p>

<h3>紗花紗布乏力</h3>
<p>紗市平疲、形勢十分衰弱、以國事多難、暴日在東北軍事日趨嚴重、致人心虚軟、散户多數觀跌、且銀根依然難以鬆落、因之商業更難發展、各帮一無興奮氣象云、</p>
<p>人標買户稀極　人標前市開盤、以時局空氣濃厚、場中買户缺乏、各跌二·三·四錢、午後近跌三·六錢、遠平、全日成交統計一萬五千四百五十包、查賣出泰興三千零五十包、大昌成一千一百包、買進明德五百包、長豐六百五十包、賡豐四百五十包、兹將收盤價列左、</p>

<h3>棉市庸碌無奮象</h3>
<p>棉市平定　但銀價雖狂縮、金價反落、而外棉狀况十分軟弱、形勢甚疲、然各路來源凋疲、又以年關催近、銀根奇緊、花商行往地頭採辦者甚少、所以到貨異常寥落、各廠對於實銷雖不辦、然價格尚堅、且多數多頭拉緊不放云、</p>
<p>漢標稍挫　漢標前市、因外棉趨跌、金價亦跌、場中買户缺乏、各月跌一·二錢、午後各月微漲五分、全日成交統計四萬三千九百擔、查賣出泰興四千擔、益昶三千九百擔、長和一千一百擔、買進公泰一千四百擔、賡豐四千六百擔、永大四千二百擔、餘昶一千六百擔、兹將收盤價列左、</p>

<h3>糧食河下米市銷滯價疲</h3>
<p>南頭　昨日各帮來源乂淡、約抵二十餘號、然浦存仍厚、城鄉店銷尤覺不振、緣受閘市修削、且貨品欠佳、厚新粳行情高料忽修削二角、薄稻貨雖不多、銷場本街寂寥、寗胃亦屢滯細、市價又短二三角、蘆洋尖到銷二淡、市歸穩態、變陰元來貨仍懈、零交平常、市無榮辱、</p>
<p>新閘　蘇常西新來貨續旺、零拆店胃因天時不佳、上市稀少、交易淡薄、市形明定暗跌、靑石薄稻到貨尚湧、亦軟一二角、洋埠尖到三四號、零户轉淡、形勢續軟、洋尖客尖亦覺淡而少神、致價疲落一角、變陰二元到銷均平、售價高定次削、</p>
<h3>現洋米漢帮續銷</h3>
<p>洋行續抛期貨…價步小</p>
<p>昨日洋米市况、有洋行繼續抛售、人心更軟、行情步落而洋行抛意甚活、昨日又有禪臣售出四月份小絞一千噸、價四兩七錢半、又五月份一千二百噸、價四兩八錢半、價比前日又小數分、仍由本街收進　現貨昨市略活、因有漢口帮問訉之故但行情仍見下落、計開出小絞米一千五百包、價九元九角至九元七角半、漢口帮辦去五百餘包、其餘由本街收進云、</p>
<h3>廠抛見停後粉市續疲</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、大致呈卒疲之象、因洋麥報價、又跌四五六七角不等、業内外人心均不見佳、惟以廠抛見停、一部分雖有套頭買賣、此出彼進、實少意思、不過照大勢而言、國事旣見日非、銀根仍然不鬆、如果貨無出路、本月份之結局、甚難樂觀也、結果本月份前日小五厘、一月份不動、二月份小二厘半、三月份爲二厘半、四月份小二</p>
<p>厘半、五月份小七厘半云、</p>
<h3>&lt;麥市滿目凄凉P]　　昨日期麥市面、一致呈沉寂之象、以洋麥雖報跌四五六七角、惟以時局不寗、無論買賣、均無心交易、所以全日各盤中、祇有一二分上落、惟至結果、則與前日完全相同、不改毫末、此種景象實爲年前所罕見、觀察後步、恐以粉銷之不起、難免波動云、糖市　粗砂白糖又跌　　太車糖尚屬平穩　　昨日糖市產區電訉、古巴現糖價爲一·一五六二五、比前電跌三一二五、紐約期糖十二月份價一·○四、明年三月份一·○六、五月份一·一一、九月份一·二四、比前電僅三五月份各跌一分、餘月無升沉、爪哇現期糖亦依然無起伏、公會市場劃盤、荷糖二十四號粗砂白、交易殊寥、買氣岑寂異常、市價因以復落、成交價至九兩九錢半、二十號中砂白九兩八錢半、二十號磨細砂白九兩八錢七分中半、趨勢仍弱、太古糖市亦微降、B嘜十一兩七錢半至二分半、DY嘜十一兩七錢、HX嘜十一兩六錢、HM嘜十一兩四錢二分半至四錢、市象尚覺平穩、華新號售出B嘜一百包、價十一兩七錢二分半CW嘜兜十一兩六錢半、且少受手云、疋頭疋市不振之面面觀　　疋市邇來跌風頗烈、良以國歷年關將届、本客咸呈結束、執貨者亟謀走脫、故不惜步步下退、以希引起客帮添胃、詎料依然呆頓、四川漢口温台寗波等帮均因銀根奇緊、大局不安、一時難呈復蘇之象、廣東汕頭厦門等埠國貨之線呢縐呢嗶嘰略有運去、但亦較上月相差遠甚、天津自被日人擾亂後、完全不動、山東全省除烟台外、東貨暢行無阻、故日來滬上頗有運去、本埠交易除門莊店稍有門市交易外、亦寥若晨星、趨勢之溝淡、實爲從來未有、呌莊因尚怒下落、故已停呌白絨布跌落達一兩左右、粗布無日不跌、十三磅貨已跌全六兩上下、十一磅以貓最軟、九磅之三鷄、寳盆已跌至四兩七錢、細布細斜走動甚微、彩條絨跌勢亦猛、西貨尺六元絨每碼暴跌有一錢左右、每箱小去有一百兩之外、束貨仍在封存中、嗣後莊欵實有無法結束之概、業此者莫不虧耗、實亦利令智昏之所致耳、珠呢走銷大非昔比　　珠頭大衣呢、爲冬令任銷大衣料二三年前風行一時藏靑色尤爲俏俐、爲呢絨店不可少之毛貨、但物極必反、年來此呢走銷大爲呆滯、本客帮均、無整箱交易、其市面之萎頓、况有一落千丈之勢、幸到貨有限、售盤尚未猛跌、然較之開盤價、則已下降至數錢銀子矣、現申市所存者、大半爲藐者色、昨五豐·公平藏靑珠頭大衣呢、一律喊售三兩○五分、泰和·安利等爲四兩二錢半至四兩六七錢云、絲茶廠經依然疲滯　　昨日本埠洋莊絲巾、仍乏進展之可能、各廠商手中執有存絲者、雖求售情殷、而歐美各莊仍持抑價抛購主義、致少抛成、昨祇三星進小車經、泰和等進白乾經二十包、價仍平疲、珍眉珠茶歐銷尚暢　　昨日本埠洋莊茶市、中低莊之珍眉·針眉·蝦目等綠茶、英莊怡和·同孚等行、繼續搜買、交易頗不寂寞、市盤亦均堅挺、惟此項合銷綠茶、摩洛哥市場、雖日來銷路復活、但存底枯薄、實感供不應求、至高莊珍眉綠茶、銷路依然呆滯云、黄白絲頭輸出寥落　　邇來黄白絲頭、輸出日减、綠海外日絲屑、廉價侵銷頗力、致我國絲頭、歐銷日趨疲滯、前日麥里遜號郵船出口、共祗運往孟買黄白長吐二十五件云、</h3>

<h3>The League of Nations Administrative Council Passes Resolution</h3>
<p>Japan Declares the Resolution Cannot Prevent Bandit Suppression Operations</p>
<p>Over Ten Thousand Students from Various Schools in Beijing Held a Large Petition Yesterday</p>
<h3>The League of Nations Administrative Council Convenes its Final Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Shi Zhaoji Finally Accepts the Resolution</p>
<p>Yoshizawa Makes a Statement Regarding the Second Section</p>
<p>U.S. Representative Dawes is Absent</p>
<p>(Paris) The League of Nations Council convened its final public meeting at 4:45 PM today. Our country's Chief Representative, Shi Zhaoji, accepted the resolution. The Japanese Chief Representative, Yoshizawa, also accepted the resolution but declared that the second section of the resolution cannot prevent the Japanese army's bandit suppression operations. Finally, the resolution was unanimously passed by all council members.</p>
<p>(National Telegram of the 10th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Our country's Chief Representative, Dr. Shi Zhaoji, declared at today's public meeting of the Council that the Chinese government agrees to the resolution and, following the Chairman's explanation, is willing to fulfill its obligations. However, there must be completely feasible methods to cope with the emergency situation. For the sake of complete understanding, please include my views and reservations in the minutes: (1) China must fully reserve all rights to remedies in legal standing according to the League of Nations Covenant, all signed conventions, and international conventions. (2) China considers the current methods expressed in the resolution and the Chairman's declaration to be a feasible approach, which includes four key points: (A) immediately cease hostilities; (B) completely revoke Japan's occupation of Manchuria in the shortest possible time; (C) neutral observers will monitor and report all subsequent developments to the Council; (D) the Council will send a commission to the area for a large-scale investigation of the entire situation in the Three Eastern Provinces. If any of these points fail to be implemented, this method will fail. Regarding the third section, China accepts it with the understanding that if the Japanese army has not completely withdrawn when the investigation team arrives in Liaoning, the team will consider investigating, reporting on, and recommending the withdrawal of the Japanese army as its primary task. Regarding the fourth section, it does not affect the right of China and its people to claim compensation for damages. Regarding the fifth section, the regulations of this section must not be violated under the pretext of the current unrest, as this unrest is caused by the Japanese army's invasion. (National News Agency Telegram of the 10th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Japanese Chief Representative, Yoshizawa, declared at today's public meeting of the Council when accepting the resolution: Regarding the second section of the resolution, I am pleased to represent the Japanese government today in accepting it with the understanding that this section does not intend to hinder the Japanese army from taking necessary actions to directly protect the lives and property of Japanese residents in various parts of the Three Eastern Provinces. (National Telegram of the 10th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The League of Nations Council's public meeting was originally scheduled to begin at 4:30 PM today. However, because U.S. Ambassador Dawes arrived at the French Foreign Ministry at 4:10 PM and had important consultations with Briand, the meeting was postponed for fifteen minutes and began at 4:45 PM. It was initially expected that Dawes might attend the Council meeting, so a chair was added next to the conference table. Immediately, rumors spread outside that Dawes would attend the meeting. However, after the meeting began, this sixteenth seat remained unoccupied, as Dawes adhered to the sincerity of the U.S. government and did not want to formally attend. (National Telegram of the 10th)</p>
<p>(Paris) At today's public meeting of the Council this afternoon, the long-suppressed emotions of the Chinese delegation may be slightly vented. However, various parties are currently exerting tremendous pressure on our Chief Representative Shi to prevent him from issuing what these people consider a painful declaration. At the same time, they are also pressuring the Japanese representative Yoshizawa not to publicly declare the right to suppress bandits again. Shi had already visited U.S. Ambassador Dawes at 11:45 AM this morning and sent a copy of the declaration draft to Dawes. The League of Nations Secretary-General, Drummond, was also present during Shi's meeting with Dawes. According to his later description of the conversation, it was extremely complex. After meeting with Dawes, at 12:30 PM, Shi immediately consulted in detail with the legal advisor of the Chinese delegation, Oerz, regarding the wording of the declaration and its legal position. Subsequently, Drummond reported the details of Shi's conversation to the Council. It is said that Dawes asked Chief Representative Shi to what extent China was willing to withdraw troops near Jinzhou, and Shi firmly refused. It is now expected that Dawes will invite the Japanese representative Yoshizawa to persuade him, hoping to reach a compromise. Furthermore, after the Council learned of the latest instructions received by the Japanese delegation, representatives from twelve countries held a secret meeting at 10:45 AM this morning to study Japan's position and consider methods to cope with the latest crisis in the Council. At that time, the draft declaration prepared by the Japanese representative Yoshizawa had also been sent by Ito to Drummond and forwarded to Briand, who read it aloud on the spot. It is said that the Japanese declaration emphasized the right to suppress bandits and did not mention the establishment of a neutral zone in Jinzhou. However, after the twelve council members discussed it thoroughly until 12:55 PM when the meeting adjourned, there was still no optimistic outlook. Now that the declarations of the Chinese and Japanese sides are completely contradictory, and the Chinese representative will also follow Yoshizawa's declaration, to express the emotions that have been suppressed for a long time due to Briand's plea, it is expected that today's public meeting this afternoon will be very lively. However, the twelve council members are currently making every effort to pressure Yoshizawa to persuade him to cancel the bandit suppression statement, saying that if Japan demands police power in Chinese territory, the council members from the small countries will definitely approve it, and the Chinese Chief Representative Shi will also declare that Japan's bandit suppression in Manchuria violates international law, which may not be beneficial to Japan. However, whether the Japanese can accept the loyal advice remains to be verified by the facts. Furthermore, according to the Council's current plan, after the public meeting at 4:30 PM this afternoon, another secret meeting will be held, at which time the members of the investigation committee may be agreed upon. It is now expected that the council members will ask Briand to recommend suitable figures from the governments represented on the committee. It is also heard that the American member is currently being considered to be filled by the Governor-General of the Philippines, Davis. However, although it is said here that Davis is a former Governor-General, U.S. officials solemnly declare that Davis is still the Chief Executive of the Philippines while on leave. (National Telegram of the 10th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The twelve members of the Administrative Council convened this morning to consider the wording of the reservation case regarding Japan's right to suppress bandits in Manchuria. This reservation case was proposed by Yoshizawa under the instructions of Foreign Minister Shidehara. The Administrative Council felt that it was extremely difficult to find a solution that could satisfy Japan without establishing a precedent for adverse consequences occurring in Manchuria. Several members of the Administrative Council are now even opposed to allowing a country the freedom to suppress bandits in land that does not belong to it, because this kind of principle will cause endless disputes in the political relations, laws, and order in Macedonia and other parts of Europe. Therefore, several members of the Administrative Council will also make criticisms on this matter. (Reuters Telegram of the 10th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Japanese representative Yoshizawa's declaration at the public meeting regarding the statement on the second section of the resolution was originally that this section would not preclude Japan's right to suppress bandits to protect the lives and property of Japanese residents in Manchuria. Later, in order to satisfy the small countries, all the council members strongly urged the addition of the phrase that this right was an exceptional measure necessary for the special situation in Manchuria.

<h3>Full Text of the Vague Draft Resolution</h3>
<p>The Chairman Explains Each Clause</p>
<p>Specific Points Have Been Deleted</p>
<p>The So-Called Bandit Suppression Right is Not Mentioned</p>
<p>(Paris) The public Administrative Council meeting was held at 5:00 PM this afternoon, lasting fifty-five minutes. The meeting was adjourned until 4:00 PM tomorrow because Yoshizawa claimed that he had not yet received instructions from Tokyo and requested an adjournment. The Administrative Council pondered carefully, and the nature of the meeting was prolonged. The public's attention to the progress of the Administrative Council has greatly diminished. Today, there were not many people gathered outside the Foreign Ministry to watch the arrival of the representatives, which was very different from the crowded scene during the first few meetings. Dr. Shi shook hands with Yoshizawa when he entered the outer room of the clock room, appearing friendly. Later, he talked with the German representative, Mudis, until the meeting began. Yoshizawa was not seen smoking his famous cigar this time. The clock chimed five times, and Briand took his seat, with the Italian representative, Sheroga, sitting on his right and the League of Nations Secretary-General, Drummond, sitting on his left. After more than three minutes, the Chairman announced the opening of the meeting. Because Italian Prime Minister Salandra, who was in power during the outbreak of the European War, passed away in Rome this morning, the Chairman made a speech in mourning. Sheroga, representing the Italian government, replied with thanks and said that he was also old and would soon follow Salandra. He would be happy to be welcomed by his good friend who had passed away before him, and he hoped that Briand would be able to come to his grave and deliver a eulogy. Briand shook his head upon hearing this, his eyes drooping, revealing a tired state. He whispered to his neighbor, mentioning his recently deceased close friend, Rocher, and then rose to read the original text of the Administrative Council's draft proposal in his clear voice as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Reaffirm the resolution unanimously passed by the Administrative Council on September 30, 1931. According to this resolution, both parties declare that they are solemnly bound by it. Therefore, we now ask the Chinese and Japanese governments to adopt all necessary methods to ensure the implementation of this resolution so that the withdrawal of Japanese troops into the railway area can be realized as soon as possible under the provisions of the resolution.</p>
<p>(2) The Administrative Council, mindful of the more serious situation since the Administrative Council meeting on October 24, records the various necessary plans adopted by both parties to avoid further aggravation of the situation and to avoid any actions that could lead to subsequent wars and loss of life.</p>
<p>(3) The Administrative Council requests both parties to continue to inform the Administrative Council of the development of the situation.</p>
<p>(4) The Administrative Council requests other members of the Administrative Council to provide the Administrative Council with any information received from their local representatives.</p>
<p>(5) The Administrative Council, in view of the special circumstances of this case, wishes to promote a final and fundamental resolution of the issues in dispute between the two countries without hindering the implementation of the above plans. Therefore, it has decided to appoint a five-member committee to investigate on the spot and report to the Administrative Council on any circumstances that may hinder international relations and endanger the peace between China and Japan or the good understanding on which peace between the two countries depends. The Chinese and Japanese governments each have the right to designate an associate to assist this committee. The Administrative Council does not wish to abandon it. Simon also stated that there are now British, French, German, Italian, and American members on the committee. The two governments will provide this committee with all kinds of facilities so that it can obtain any information it needs on the spot. It is currently understood that if both parties initiate any negotiations, these negotiations will not fall within the scope of this committee's duties, and the committee is not qualified to interfere with any military arrangements of either party. The appointment and consideration of this committee do not hinder the understanding given by the Japanese government in the September 30 resolution regarding the withdrawal of Japanese troops to the railway area.</p>
<p>(6) The Administrative Council will continue to pay attention to this matter. During the period between now and the next regular session on January 25 of next year, the Chairman is requested to pay attention to this issue and reconvene it if necessary.</p>
<p>Chairman Briand, in his explanatory statement, said that this proposal stipulates two courses of action: the first is to end the current actions that endanger peace, and the second is to facilitate the final resolution of the existing causes of the dispute. The Administrative Council is pleased that all parties agree to investigate the situation that may disrupt Sino-Japanese relations at the current meeting. Therefore, it welcomes the proposal to establish a committee submitted to the Administrative Council on November 21. The last paragraph of this proposal stipulates the establishment and duties of this committee.</p>
<p>Briand then criticized each paragraph of the proposal, saying that the first paragraph repeatedly reaffirms the October 30 resolution, especially emphasizing the withdrawal of Japanese troops to the railway area as soon as possible under the provisions of the resolution. The Administrative Council attaches great importance to this case and hopes that the two governments will find ways to complete the fulfillment of their September 30 commitments. Briand mentioned the second paragraph, saying that unfortunately, since the last session of the Administrative Council, the incident has increased, and the situation is serious, causing due anxiety. Both parties should not adopt any actions that could lead to future wars or other actions that could expand the situation. In addition to China and Japan, members of the Administrative Council will contact both parties under the fourth paragraph so that both parties can indicate to the members the locations they wish the members to send their representatives to. Briand continued to mention the fifth paragraph of the proposal, saying that the duties of the committee are quite broad and limited to advisory nature. The committee can study all kinds of issues that can disrupt the peace or good understanding between China and Japan. China and Japan each have the right to ask the committee to consider any issues they wish the committee to study. The committee has complete discretion to decide which issues to report to the Administrative Council and has the right to issue interim reports if necessary. If the commitments made by both parties under the September 30 resolution have not been fulfilled when the committee arrives, the committee should immediately report this situation to the Administrative Council. This paragraph specifically stipulates that if both parties initiate negotiations, this matter does not fall within the scope of the committee's duties, and interfering with the military arrangements of either party is not within the qualifications of the committee. However, the latter provision does not limit the committee's investigative duties. Furthermore, the committee enjoys complete freedom of action so that it can obtain any information it wants. (Reuters Telegram of the 9th)</p>
<p>(Paris) There are some differences between the draft resolution and the Chairman's explanatory statement and those presented and read at the Administrative Council today. (1) Section 5 of the resolution has been moved into the explanatory statement due to Japan's expressed hope. The original text of this section, "When the investigation team arrives in Manchuria, if the withdrawal of troops has not been completed, the team should submit a report, etc." should be deleted, and the original text of Section 1 of the explanation, "The presence of foreign troops in Chinese territory actually creates an abnormal situation, etc." has also been deleted. (2) The original text of Section 2 of the declaration regarding the bandit suppression issue, "But one point must be clarified, etc." has been completely deleted, that is, the entire text regarding police power has also been deleted. The Administrative Council therefore spent a lot of effort in consultations with Yoshizawa. Yoshizawa intended to replace it with a unilateral declaration by Japan, which aroused the opposition of the Administrative Council. It has not been decided until the last moment, but a method acceptable to all parties may be found. (Havas Telegram of the 9th)</p>
<h3>Students in France Hold Demonstration March</h3>
<p>Demanding Representative Shi Withdraw from the League of Nations</p>
<p>(Paris) This morning, Chinese students here held a mass meeting of overseas Chinese, followed by a demonstration march, and at 10:00 AM, they met with Chief Representative Shi, demanding that China withdraw from the League of Nations. (National News Agency Telegram of the 10th)</p>
<h3>Scope of the Investigation Team Limited to the Eastern Provinces</h3>
<p>British Foreign Minister Answers Questions from Members of Parliament</p>
<p>London Foreign Minister Sir Simon replied in the Lower House today to a member's question about the safety of British residents in Tianjin and Beiping, saying that in addition to the British troops and other defense forces currently stationed there, naval reinforcements can still be dispatched for protection in emergencies. Therefore, the lives and property of British residents can be guaranteed. The Foreign Minister also replied to a question, saying that the current League of Nations Administrative Council is being held in Paris for the convenience of Briand and others, but the custom of the Administrative Council meeting in Geneva, and the five-nation observers represent their respective governments in inspecting everything in the Three Eastern Provinces. A member of parliament also asked about the powers of the League of Nations investigation committee. Simon replied that this matter is currently under discussion by the Administrative Council. He cannot inform them of anything other than knowing that the scope of the investigation is limited to the Three Eastern Provinces. (Reuters Telegram of the 9th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) News from London here says that British Foreign Minister Simon announced in the Lower House yesterday that the scope of investigation of the League of Nations investigation committee is limited to the Three Eastern Provinces, which is very surprising. The fifth paragraph of the draft resolution clearly stipulates investigation in China, which is the point that Japan has always advocated. (Checking the original text of the fifth paragraph of the resolution received by Reuters, it only mentions on-site investigation and does not contain the words "China") (Reuters Telegram of the 10th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Soldiers at Xinmin Station Beat the Stationmaster</h3>
<p>Arrested the Driver and Brakeman</p>
<p>Released Only After Negotiations</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The 159th southbound freight train of the Beining Railway arrived at Xinmin at 11:10 AM on the 10th. Because the 105th afternoon passenger train departs from Liuhegou, it is customary to let the passenger train go first. Also, because the Japanese military vehicle occupied the tracks in the station, the freight train stopped on the siding outside the station. The Japanese soldiers were furious, and Stationmaster Pang was severely injured in the beating. They also arrested the driver, Zhang, and the brakeman. Car guard Lu Encheng escaped. The Deputy Section Chief Wang of Huanggu Tun, the Stationmaster Li Jian of the South Manchuria Railway, and the Xinmin Stationmaster Qin went to the Japanese Consulate for negotiations. The arrested driver and brakeman were all released. The Japanese Consulate put forward the conditions: (1) In the future, if there are no empty tracks in Xinmin Station, the Liuhegou Station is not allowed to release the southbound train; (2) If the above situation occurs, the employees involved may be shot and killed according to military law without question.

<h3>Beining Road Concludes Agreement with the Japanese Army</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) East of Dahu Mountain on the Beining Road, because there is no railway police to maintain order, the train is often robbed by bandits. The method of agreement with the Japanese army was implemented today: (1) From Dahu Mountain to Xinmin, the Railway Bureau is allowed to send 20 armed police officers to escort the train back and forth; (2) The Japanese army will issue a boarding permit; (3) The railway police will wear armbands for identification; (4) The railway police are not allowed to get off the train in the Japanese army's defense area; (5) The railway police are not allowed to leak Japanese military information.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Bandit Suppression and Protecting Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>The true face of the League of Nations has been clearly revealed to the world since the September 18th Incident. The League Covenant is a talisman for deceiving weak nations, and the League is a paper tiger, big but useless. The so-called justice and peace are merely illusions for fools. Anyone today who still harbors hopes and expectations of the League of Nations for upholding justice and peace must be the most foolish person in the world.</p>
<p>Since the three League of Nations assemblies, its actions of favoring Japan and suppressing China have been elaborated upon in our previous commentaries. Moreover, we have long been disillusioned with the League and have known that it is incapable. If China wants to save itself, it must rely on its own strength. Therefore, we do not wish to make any further criticisms of the six clauses of the draft resolution and Mr. Briand's explanatory declaration presented at the League of Nations' public meeting on the 9th. The League of Nations' actions today are merely attempts to find a way to step down gracefully. The so-called six-clause draft resolution is entirely inconsequential. One clause states that "the Chinese and Japanese governments shall take all necessary measures." Another clause states that "both parties are responsible for taking all necessary measures to avoid further aggravation of the current situation," as if China should also bear some responsibility for the September 18th tragedy and the current serious situation of Japan's invasion of our country. At the same time, the most important issue of withdrawing Japanese troops is addressed only with the phrase "to be completed in the shortest possible time," with no specific deadline. Regarding the powers of the Commission of Inquiry, it is even more explicitly stated that it will "not question either party's commencement of any negotiations, nor interfere with either party's military actions." This is a clear concession to the Japanese side to maintain its face and step down gracefully, which is blatantly obvious. What else can we say about this? The only thing is that Mr. Briand's declaration, while not explicitly mentioning Japan's so-called right to suppress bandits, openly acknowledges Japan's right to protect overseas Chinese. This is an altered but essentially unchanged stance that complies with the Japanese demands and openly deceives the world, which we must sternly expose.</p>
<p>The reason why Japan insists on retaining the right to suppress bandits is, in reality, nothing more than an attempt to use the pretext of bandit suppression to provoke incidents at any time, advance troops at any time, and repeat the atrocities of September 18th at any time. In the eyes of the Japanese, all Chinese people are bandits who should be suppressed. Even if there are no bandits, the means of deliberately destroying railway tracks and fabricating accusations, as well as buying off figures like Zhang HaiPeng and instigating them to create trouble as a pretext for advancing troops, could be carried out again. They merely want to use the name of bandit suppression to continue expanding their atrocities. Otherwise, within China's territory, sovereignty is sacred and has nothing to do with the Japanese. Why argue about the right to suppress bandits? The League of Nations has not only failed to expose their conspiracy but even openly declared that their claim is reasonable. Although this proposal is not explicitly mentioned now, it is replaced by a disguised right to protect overseas Chinese without territorial limitations. If this is true, the League of Nations has indeed accepted the Japanese proposal and is still trying to deceive the world with a disguised claim. This is the epitome of hypocrisy. The responsibility for protecting overseas Japanese can be fully borne by China after the withdrawal of Japanese troops. China has repeatedly stated that it can take full responsibility for the safety of foreign nationals. In fact, there has been no cause for concern about the safety of overseas Japanese in China since September 18th. Moreover, various coastal and riverine ports in China today already have Japanese warships stationed there, guaranteeing the safety of overseas Chinese. Why make such alarming statements and solemnly claim the right to protect overseas Chinese? Furthermore, Japanese merchants are spread throughout China. If every overseas Japanese must be accompanied by several armed bodyguards, there is no such precedent in the world. Under the guise of protecting overseas Chinese, the Japanese military can send troops to be stationed throughout China. Under some conspiracy, they can implement the consistent tactic of "taking legitimate self-defense to protect overseas Chinese." This means that trouble can be stirred up at any time anywhere in China, and the same tragedy as September 18th can occur at any time. "Protecting overseas Chinese, protecting overseas Chinese!" Endless disasters will be bred under these words from now on.</p>
<p>Moreover, on the other side of the reality, the Japanese are now actively preparing to attack Jinzhou. The Japanese side's complete lack of sincerity for peace is well-known to the world. Can the League of Nations not see this? It is simply bowing to brute force and also happens to be a representative of the powerful, so it cannot have a fair resolution. Then, is our country still praying to this puppet, hoping to move the League of Nations' final compassion with the sincerity of fools?</p>

He believes that at this time, he hopes that everyone will guide the public with genuine public opinion. His intentions can be summarized in two points: (1) be practical and do things down to earth; (2) do not say irresponsible things. At this time of national crisis, all Chinese people should strive to save the country from danger. As a member responsible for the country, I feel that I have let the country down in the past. From now on, I will act according to my conscience and do my best to safeguard the country, even at the cost of my personal life. I hope everyone will uphold justice and not be obscured by frivolous words. That would be fortunate. (Special dispatch, 10th)</p>

<h3>Joint Parade and Petition by Students from Various Schools in the Capital</h3>
<p>Received by Yu Youren of the National Government</p>
<p>Schools to Hold Representatives' Meeting Today</p>
<p>To Discuss the Points of Yu's Reply</p>
<p>(Nanjing) In order to urge the public to rise up and resist Japan and to urge the government to implement revolutionary diplomacy, the anti-Japanese associations of various schools in the capital held a joint petition and parade on the 10th. At 9:00 AM, male and female students from 25 universities and public and private middle schools gathered at the Zhongnan Middle School sports field, totaling about 10,000 people. Each school sent one representative and one disciplinarian. Chen Guangzeng of Nanjing Women's Middle School was elected chairman. At 10:00, the group set off, passing through Chengmai Street, Gulou, Zhongshan Road, Xinjiekou, Zhongzheng Road, Hualou, and Daxing Palace, shouting slogans along the way: (1) Achieve peaceful unification; (2) Drive Japanese troops out of the country; (3) Oppose the establishment of a neutral zone in Jinzhou; (4) Oppose joint administration of Tianjin; (5) Oppose a retreating diplomatic policy; (6) Remove Gu Weijun from office; (7) Oppose suppressing patriotic movements; (8) Assist the arrested students of Peking University; (9) Implement democratic politics; (10) Long live the Three Principles of the People; (11) Long live the Republic of China. When they arrived in front of the National Government, they lined up in separate rows. Twenty-four representatives were selected to enter and petition. They were first received by Secretary Zhu Wenzhong, and then by National Committee member Yu Youren. The representatives stated the purpose of the petition: (1) to ensure that a neutral zone will not be established in Jinzhou and that Tianjin will not be jointly administered, and to remove Gu Weijun from office; (2) to effectively protect the people's movement and to severely punish the officials responsible for the assault on Peking University students; (3) to fulfill all the promises made to students in previous petitions, such as achieving peaceful unification and Chairman Jiang going north immediately to pledge not to sign any treaties that would humiliate the country. Yu replied that the first point was already a thing of the past, that Gu had not been working at the ministry, and had resigned from his post. Regarding the second point, the government had not restricted the people's movement in any way, and the officials responsible for the assault on Peking University students would be investigated and punished. Regarding the third point, peaceful unification could be achieved after the representatives from Guangdong arrived in Shanghai. Lin Sen, Shao Lizi, and He Yingqin had been sent to Shanghai to negotiate. After peaceful unification was achieved, Chairman Jiang would naturally go north, and treaties that would humiliate the country would certainly not be signed. The representatives then excused themselves and reported to the whole group before disbanding and returning to school. It is said that the schools will hold a representatives' meeting at Nan'an Middle School on the afternoon of the 11th to discuss the points of the National Government's reply. If they deem it satisfactory, they will then set a date to resume classes. (Special dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) During the parade and demonstration by various schools today, more than a dozen other individuals mixed into the large group and shouted various strange slogans. The disciplinarian team detained nine people on the spot and sent them to Zhongda, and sent a letter to the Capital Police Department to send personnel to inquire about the content. The officials inquired and found them to be plainclothes agents from the security team and released them. (Special dispatch, 10th)</p>
<h3>Zhongda Anti-Japanese Association Receives News Reporters</h3>
<p>Reorganization to Express Attitude</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Zhongda Anti-Japanese Association received journalists from both inside and outside Nanjing at 4:00 PM on the 10th, reporting on the following key points: 1. The diplomatic situation has been critical recently, and the government has no way to deal with it and is tending to surrender to Japan. As the highest institution of higher learning in the capital, the school should awaken the public and actively urge the government to strike classes with the students from various schools in the capital and Beiping, Shanghai, and Jinan to make a general demonstration. 2. The process of the school's students assisting the arrested students of Peking University is inconsistent with the Central News Agency's report. 3. Explain the school's misunderstanding with the Central News Agency reporter personally. 4. The process of the school's students petitioning the Ministry of Education for early vacation and President Zhu's resignation. 5. Report the truth about the representatives of Zhongda and Peking University being beaten and detained by gangsters at the instigation of others in Shanghai. 6. The school has received news that students from Ping, Ji, and Hu are coming to Beijing to demonstrate immediately. 7. The news media is the center of public opinion. Anti-Japanese and national salvation should stand on the same position, and there should be accurate records of student movements. Finally, a certain reporter responded and dispersed. (Special dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Zhongda Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association was reorganized and established. It issued a notice, stating its attitude: 1.

The Association has a patriotic enthusiasm to resist Japan externally and never internally. 3. The Association's mission and direction of efforts will be carried out in accordance with the public opinion of all students of the school. The resolutions of the general assembly are by no means an emotional release, but a strengthening of power. 4. The Association will never oppose the government, but will only follow the Prime Minister's advocacy of the Principle of People's Rights as a member of the public, and urge the government to realize the preservation of the nation, the realization of people's rights, and the stability of people's livelihood. (Special dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Zhongda Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association has recently learned that a few unscrupulous people, in the name of the Communist Elimination and National Salvation Corps, often issue anonymous leaflets, falsely claiming that the actions of all the students of Zhongda are the role of Communist riots, and specifically refer to students Wang Shouzhong and others as Communist members. This kind of unreasonable rumor-mongering is obviously a small means used by one or two villains to sabotage the patriotic movement. A special telegram declared the truth. If there is any further slander and sabotage, it will be investigated and dealt with according to law. (Special dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhongda held a general meeting on the 10th and decided to send a telegram to the Shanghai Municipal Government to question the reasons for the assault on classmate Jiang Xueqian, that Mayor Zhang Qun must apologize to the school, and request the execution of Chen Xizeng, demand that the Shanghai Municipal Government bear the medical expenses, continue the strike, and that the student association and professors organize a school affairs maintenance committee, and that the righteous soldiers continue to practice starting on the 11th.

<h3>Hoover Reports on Finances</h3>
<p>Advocates Tax Increases to Offset Budget Deficit</p>
<p>Washington, 9th (Kuomintang Telegram) - The US President's budget report and tax increase plan have been released in Congress. The total budget for the next fiscal year is $3,942,754,614. It is estimated that the budget deficit for the 1931 fiscal year will be $902,000,000, and the combined budget shortfall for 1932 and 1933 will reach $3,247,000,000. This is due to increased expenditures, reduced tax revenues, and increased treasury deficits. Therefore, it is proposed to temporarily increase taxes for two years. According to the tax increase plan proposed by the Secretary of the Treasury, no one in the country will be unaffected. The income tax liability threshold will be lowered, and the tax rate will also be increased. Unmarried men with annual incomes of $1,000 and married men with annual incomes of $1,500 will be subject to taxation. The tax rate will be increased to 2% for incomes below $4,000, 4% for incomes between $4,000 and $8,000, and 6% for incomes above $8,000. In addition, a business transaction surtax will be levied, ranging from 1% to 3.7%. Furthermore, most commodities and entertainment, as well as telephone, telegraph, check, and draft services, will be subject to taxation. Special taxes will be levied on automobiles, phonographs, cigarettes, and tobacco. Even the postage for letters will be increased from two cents to three cents. According to President Hoover, this tax increase is based on the 1924 Revenue Act. The budget includes $72,000,000 for the Veterans Bureau and $342,600,000 for naval expenses, a significant increase from last year. This includes $15,000,000 for battleship renovations and $31,400,000 for new ship construction, stipulating a naval strength of 79,700 personnel. There are no plans to close shipyards or eliminate old ships. However, the Marine Corps strength will be reduced from 17,500 to 15,340. The army budget is $321,944,000, with a troop strength of 118,750 personnel. Another noteworthy item is the expansion of Far East trade funding by $408,000.</p>

<h3>Failure to Achieve Joint Cabinet, Japanese Minister of Interior Intends to Resign</h3>
<p>Tokyo, Electric Communications, 10th - Because the issue of a joint cabinet could not be realized, Minister of Interior Adachi has decided to submit his resignation independently. However, judging from the current situation, if Adachi suddenly resigns, it is feared that major turmoil will occur in the political future.</p>
<p>Tokyo, Reuters, 10th - The possibility of forming a mixed cabinet at an early date is once again a subject of intense discussion in political circles. Although no news has been released by official sources, the general opinion is that a major change is imminent. Tomita, an advisor to the Minseito Party, visited Prime Minister Wakatsuki this afternoon. The Prime Minister immediately convened an emergency cabinet meeting, reportedly to consider Tomita's proposal to form a mixed cabinet.</p>
<h3>British Labour Party Impeaches Government</h3>
<p>London, Reuters, 10th - Last night, the Labour Party filed an impeachment motion in the House of Commons, stating that as winter approaches and the people suffer even more, the government has failed to adopt effective methods to deal with the current state of currency and exchange rates, develop trade, and relieve unemployment. The Labour Party is deeply saddened and wishes to restore Britain's trust as a financial center. The government should announce its currency policy so that the world knows how Britain will manage its debt and exchange rates. It seems the government has no remedial measures, causing people to feel increasingly uneasy. Prime Minister MacDonald replied that the government is not in a position to announce whether or not to return to the gold standard. It would be insane to announce the permanent value of the British currency now, given the current situation affecting it, without waiting for the international situation to stabilize what is currently governing the British currency. Resolving the international debt problem is the foundation of our current currency position. The British government regrets any unnecessary delays in convening an international conference to resolve this issue, but the government, based on its experience, firmly believes that its own initiative to promote the convening of such an international conference will have no effect. The government is aware that the experts currently meeting in Basel are deeply aware of the importance of their work and will soon submit their report. An international conference can follow the experts' meeting. He believes that the international conference should be opened immediately after receiving the experts' report and should approach its work with a pragmatic spirit. The Prime Minister also said that since the establishment of the National Government, it has been efficient in its work and balancing the budget, which has greatly helped the country. He also hopes that the people will not lose their sense of proportion in their active thrift. Many people believe that merely cutting expenditures is beneficial to the country. It is known that in certain situations, ignoring everything else and only knowing how to cut government can have extremely harmful effects on the country.</p>

<h3>US Minister Protests Illegal Closure of Radio Station by Japanese Army</h3>
<p>Shenyang, Great American Evening News, 9th - It has been learned that the US Minister in Beiping has again strongly protested to the commander of the Japanese army in Shenyang against the continued closure of the Shenyang Radio Station. The station was built by Zhang Xueliang in cooperation with the American Radio Corporation and has a direct communication contract between Shenyang and San Francisco. Although the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Japanese Ambassador to the United States, and the Japanese representative to the League of Nations have repeatedly stated that the Shenyang Radio Station will soon resume communication, it has been three months so far, and there is still no sign of resuming service. According to an employee of the American Radio Corporation, the station's average daily income is about US$300, which is shared by the company and the Chinese Ministry of Communications. Since it was closed by the Japanese army, the losses have been considerable, forcing the company to consider demanding a large amount of compensation from the Japanese military. It is reported that the content of the US Embassy's protest is to ask the Japanese military commander to note that after the closure of the station, American merchants and the American Consulate and Commerce Department have experienced major inconveniences, as they are forced to exclusively use Japanese telegrams and are subject to military inspection.</p>
<h3>Student Petition Movement Expands in Shandong</h3>
<p>High School Students Decide to March South on Foot</p>
<p>Junior High School Students Also Join En Masse</p>
<p>Jinpu Station Becomes a Student World</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence - The Shandong Senior High School student petition group, since arriving at Jinpu Station at 5:00 AM on the 5th to await a train to Beijing, has undergone repeated changes and ultimately failed to depart. Over five hundred students have been guarding the station for three days and two nights, vowing not to return to school. In recent days, Jinan has been filled with clouds of sorrow, with drizzling rain, and the students have been braving the wind and rain, enduring cold and hunger, without the slightest hesitation. They have decided that if there is no transportation, they will march south on foot to achieve their goal of entering Beijing. Currently, the military and police are heavily guarded, maintaining order at the station. Over two thousand male and female students from all over Jinan City have also arrived at the station, wanting to act in unison with their senior high school classmates and petition in Beijing. They are currently in a standoff. The details of the process are described below:</p>
<p>Military and Police Maintain Traffic, Restore Operations - At around 9:00 PM on the 6th, Wu Huawen, the commander of the 2nd Regiment of the Pistol Brigade, was ordered to lead the 2nd Battalion of his troops to the station to forcefully restore traffic. All the station staff also arrived at the station one after another to resume work. At 10:00 PM, a freight train arriving from the north entered the station first. The night was extremely cold, with piercing winds and flickering lights, creating a very desolate scene. The students at the station did not take any action. At 2:00 AM this morning (the 7th), the Pingpu Train No. 202 arrived in Jinan and then headed north again. Qingdao Mayor Hu Ruoyu took this train to Beiping. At 6:20 AM, dawn had broken, and the Pingpu Train No. 201 arrived from the north and then headed south again. At 9:00 AM, the Jinpu Train No. 1 arrived from the north and passed through Jinan. Traffic was fully restored. The students did not interfere, but when Train No. 202 passed through Jinan, they wanted to stop it. However, the passengers on the train were students from Chaoyang University, who were also returning from petitioning in Beijing and had not eaten or drunk for more than a day, so the students let the train go north.</p>
<p>High School Decides to March South on Foot - During these two days and nights, there have been changes three or four times. The High School petition group, seeing that there was no hope of requesting transportation, and with many students sick due to cold and hunger, but vowing not to return to school until their goal was achieved, convened a joint meeting at 2:00 AM today and decided that the entire body would march to Beijing to petition and stipulated that they would walk about 40 li (about 13 miles) per day. A transportation team was organized, with students who had bicycles volunteering, and a portion was designated for the use of the dining committee. The chief of special affairs and the dining committees of each division also organized the dining committee to take practical responsibility. If it was necessary to stay in a small village, the transportation team would be sure to request the village head to help find food and lodging and pay in advance. It is reported that they are scheduled to depart south at 8:00 AM on the 8th.</p>
<p>Han Summons Students for a Lecture, Students Refuse - Shandong Province Chairman Han Fuju, seeing that hundreds of students were guarding the station and that the situation was not resolved, ordered Jinan Mayor Wen Chenglie to summon all the students to the Provincial Government for a lecture. Wen announced to the students, saying that the Chairman did not want them to petition in Beijing, and now that he heard that the students had decided to march on foot, that the Chairman was willing to allocate funds to support their travel expenses. The students indicated that since the Chairman could not provide transportation to send them to Beijing, there was no need for them to go to the Provincial Government to listen to the lecture, and they were even less willing to receive support for their travel expenses. Wen Chenglie then reported to Han Fuju by telephone. Han then instructed Wen to allow the students to march, but not to leave Jinan and to hinder traffic within two or three stations. If there was any behavior outside of the proper bounds, the government could not sit idly by.</p>
<p>Fifteen Schools Depart En Masse - The middle schools and above in Jinan City (male and female, fifteen units) had a joint meeting the night before last, deciding to act in unison with the high schools and petition in Beijing en masse. After receiving the news, the Education Department summoned the principals of each school to He Siyuan's private residence at 6:00 PM last night to discuss measures, deciding to separately persuade them to desist. After going back and forth over ten times, they ultimately failed to achieve any effect at 10:30 PM last night. Starting at 8:00 AM this morning, male and female students from each school lined up in the rain one after another to gather at the station, over 2,500 people in total, each holding banners, with clothes and parcels on their backs. The female students were mostly wearing long robes. After these two thousand plus students arrived at the station, they first sent representatives to the stationmaster's office to negotiate for transportation, but the enforcement team did not allow them to enter the station, so the students stood outside the station, a large number of people, with banners flying, and the station became a student world for a time. Education Department Director He Siyuan, along with section chief Lai Zhizhong, secretary-director Wang Jinxin, and the principals of each school, all arrived at the station to take care of the situation, and finally negotiated with the military and police to allow them to enter the station and gather on the North Station platform.</p>
<p>Students Continue to Detain Two Trains - At the station, in addition to the five hundred plus high school students occupying Train No. 8, over two thousand newly arrived students were also waiting for transportation. The Tianjin-Jinan Train No. 9 arrived in Jinan at 11:00 AM. When it was converted to Train No. 10 and returning to Tianjin in the afternoon, it was detained by the students, who sent people to stand on the tracks and prevent it from departing. The Pingpu Train No. 202 arrived in Jinan at 6:10 PM and was also intercepted by the students, who prevented it from heading north again. A portion of the students had already boarded Train No. 202, but when the train would depart was still unknown. (December 7th)</p>
<h3>Guangdong Fourth Plenary Session Concludes</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: The Fourth Plenary Session of the Guangdong Provincial Party Congress resumed its eleventh meeting on the fourth of this month. 467 delegates were present, and 129 people attended as observers. The session was chaired by Wu Chao-shu, chairman of the presidium. After the ceremony, the presidium's two provisional proposals were discussed: (1) In order to implement democracy and prevent warlords from becoming domineering, all military officers, large and small, across the country, should be directly or indirectly subordinate to the Executive Yuan, subject to its orders, commands, or supervision; (2) During peacetime, there should be no setting up of commanders-in-chief or similar military positions for the army, navy, and air force. Both proposals were passed without objection. Subsequently, the formal election of members and alternate members of the Central Executive and Supervisory Committees commenced. The election results were as follows: Five Central Executive Committee members were elected: Bai Chongxi (363 votes), Li Yangjing (323 votes), Yu Hanmou (310 votes), Lin Yizhong (264 votes), and Zhang Huichang (240 votes). Three Central Supervisory Committee members were elected: Xiang Hanping (295 votes), Zhang Fakui (263 votes), and Tang Shaoyi (232 votes). In addition, twelve alternate executive committee members were elected: Qu Fangpu, Huang Xuchu, Cheng Tiantong, Zhan Jusi, Huang Jilu, Liang Hancao, Guan Suren, Li Renren, Zeng Zhongming, Cui Guangxi, Huang Fusheng, and Zhang Dingfan (next highest votes). Yang Aiyuan and He Shizhen were elected as five alternate Central Supervisory Committee members, Lin Zhimian, Miao Peinan, Li Qian, Qu Fangpu, Chen Zhongfu (next highest votes), Chen Qun, and Sun Jingya. The election concluded at 5 p.m., and the meeting adjourned. On the morning of the fifth, the closing ceremony of the Fourth Plenary Session was held, with over 400 delegates present. Hu Hanmin presided over the ceremony. After the salutations, the congress's declaration was read by the secretary, and it was passed unanimously by the entire assembly. Subsequently, Hu Hanmin delivered the closing address, stating that the slogan highly promoted at this congress was "Sincere Unity to Face National Crisis." However, upon examining the facts, the domestic worries and foreign troubles of our country have come one after another, nothing more than showing that our party cannot bear the heavy responsibility of governing the country. The reason for this, after searching for it, is purely due to our party's own unsoundness and the inability of our party comrades to thoroughly unite. Everyone only knows how to use factionalism within the party as a tool for political struggle, causing the party to be divided into four or five factions. Comrades are not using the entire party as a tool externally, completely neglecting the mission our party bears. Therefore, in recent years, the people's belief in our party has sharply diminished, and there has even been criticism of the Kuomintang as a "family party," a "people's party," or a "national army party." Such harsh criticism is difficult to deny in fact. From now on, comrades should painfully correct their past mistakes, and use kinship and sincerity to save themselves and others. The second slogan of the congress was to overthrow dictatorship and implement democratic politics. People today believe that seeking unity must concentrate power, but the result of concentrating power is the formation of dictatorship. However, as a result of dictatorship, the Qing Dynasty perished because of this, and Yuan Shikai died because of this. The lessons of the past are not far away, so is it necessary to repeat them? Regarding the theory of unity, there are roughly three points: believing in military unification and political unification will surely fail; only economic unification, starting with construction and transportation, can achieve the practical effect of unity. Today, in this extraordinary period, our responsibilities are even greater. If we repeat past habits, it will form a phenomenon of meeting without discussing, discussing without deciding, deciding without acting, and acting without moving. If so, we are not only letting down the party and the country, but also our own revolutionary beliefs. From now on, we should strive to implement the resolutions of the congress, internally eliminate the Communist Party, and externally overthrow Japanese imperialism. We must be able to compile the results of our efforts into statistics and announce them to the world by next year, so that we can redeem our past transgressions. After Hu's speech, the crowd applauded and shouted slogans before dispersing. At 3 p.m. on the fifth, the first interim joint meeting of the fourth Central Executive and Supervisory Committee members in Guangdong was held, with more than 30 attendees. Chaired by Hu Hanmin, the following two proposals were decided: (1) To nominate standing committee members of the Central Executive and Supervisory Committees, on the spot, Hu Hanmin, Wang Jingwei, Sun Ke, Wu Chao-shu, Jing Hengyi, Bai Chongxi, Chen Jitang, Ju Zheng, and Shi Qingyang were nominated as nine standing committee members of the Executive Committee, Tang Shaoyi, Xiao Focheng, Deng Zeru, Xiang Hanping, and Li Zongren as five standing committee members of the Supervisory Committee; (2) It was decided to establish a temporary office of the Central Party Headquarters in Guangdong, with the original site of the extraordinary meeting as the office location, Liu Jiwen was nominated as secretary-general, and a telegram was sent to the whole country announcing the reasons for the establishment of the temporary office of the Central Party Headquarters. The declaration of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Guangdong Provincial Party Congress is appended below.</p>
<p>(Omitted above) The disputes within our party have reached a point where they can no longer be prolonged, the political situation is becoming increasingly wrong to the point that it can no longer be tolerated, and the national crisis is growing daily, also to the point where the responsibility can no longer be evaded. Therefore, all comrades in the party must make a major reform resolution at present, and seek a fundamental solution to the disputes within the party and the inappropriate political system at the same time, in order to alleviate the current national crisis. However, seeking a fundamental solution must completely reverse what our party has done in the past few years, and strive to correct it in detail. That is, the past history of division in our party must be turned into a history of unity, and the old path of the military grasping politics and politics grasping the party must be turned into a broad path of the party ruling through political guidance, and politics guiding the military. Our party is determined to save the country from the current crisis, and it is also related to completing the legacy of the Premier in the future. Now, at the moment of our party's great unity, we would like to state the necessary reforms in the three aspects of party, government, and military that we have confirmed in the past peaceful struggle, as follows:</p>
<p>1. In order to achieve the goal of our party implementing the National Revolution, our party comrades must take the Premier's legacy as the will, the center of unified spirit and unity, and especially based on the Premier's spirit of "the world is for all," correct the party's internal organization and the methods it uses, eliminate all struggles within the party, and make the party truly a powerful and effective revolutionary group, to lead the people in implementing the construction of the Three People's Principles.</p>
<p>2. All major disputes concerning party affairs and government affairs must not be resolved by force unless a plenary session of the Central Executive Committee is convened, with the attendance of more than two-thirds of the members, and the approval of more than two-thirds of the members present through a secret ballot. Only in this way can the past scourge of lightly initiating civil wars be avoided, and the path for peaceful political progress in the future be opened up.</p>
<p>3. At the first plenary session of the Fourth Central Executive Committee, a concrete plan for the party's reorganization in the future shall be determined based on the proposals of the Fourth National Congress of both parties, and the organization law of the National Government shall be revised and the National Government shall be reorganized in accordance with the Outline of National Construction and in consideration of the actual situation.</p>
<p>4. In order for the National Government to be truly responsible to the party and implement the program of doctrines, it must adhere to the principles of the Central Political System Reform Plan discussed at the recent Shanghai Peace Conference, so that the five branches can independently assume responsibilities and exercise their powers, so as to realize the spirit of the five-power system. At the same time, the political system must be unified, the organization must be streamlined, the powers must be clearly defined, and the responsibilities must be clearly defined, so as to increase political efficiency.</p>
<p>5. Central political organs should participate in elected members, so that the government and the people can cooperate effectively, so that civil rights can gradually develop and gradually achieve the goal of constitutional government.</p>
<p>6. The primary task of the period of political tutelage is to complete local autonomy, so that the people can gain training in exercising political power, so as to gradually participate in central political affairs and establish the foundation for democratic politics. As for the people's rights, such as freedom of body, residence, business, speech, publication, association, assembly, etc., they should be guaranteed by law.</p>
<p>7. In order to achieve the peaceful development of the country, the military must be subjected to political control and serve as a guarantee for supporting civil rights and enriching national defense. The principle is that military power must be decided by the party and executed by the government, military administration is subordinate to the Executive Yuan, military law and military supplies must be independent, and military regions must be established throughout the country, the areas of which do not have to be the same as the division of administrative regions, so that national defense is subordinate to the central government and security belongs to the local government, so as to prevent military personnel from interfering in the administration of the country.</p>
<p>8. Public finance must be open, so that the government and people's economic organizations can jointly organize public finance, review budgets and final accounts, supervise domestic and foreign debts and the revenues and expenditures of the central and local governments. The provision and burden of military expenses shall be limited to the purposes of national defense, security, and suppression of bandits, and shall not be squandered on civil wars.</p>
<p>9. All construction in the future must be based on the legacy of the Premier and the program and policies of the First National Congress. Those that have not been implemented should strive to implement them, and those that have been implemented but whose methods of implementation are wrong should be corrected.</p>
<p>10. Foreign policy must adhere to the legacy of the Premier, realize the goal of abolishing unequal treaties and overthrowing imperialism, so as to restore national freedom and complete the independence of our country. This time, the troubles in the three northeastern provinces occurred, and the government and officials took improper actions, which led to the increasingly rampant Japanese imperialism. In the future, to remedy this, it is necessary to follow the Premier's legacy of foreign policy, consider international conventions and various situations of international organizations that can be used as assistance, establish a diplomatic policy, and carry out just work of avenging shame and defending oneself, so as to make the violent Japan submit to justice, so as to achieve the goal of our country restoring sovereignty and preserving territory.</p>
<p>The above ten points are deeply believed to be necessary policies for reforming internal affairs, and also urgent methods for relieving the difficulties of the times. If they can be implemented immediately, then the improvement of other aspects such as education, economy, society, and culture can be borrowed from. If it is not like this, it will not only be insufficient to plan the unity of the party and fulfill the expectations of the people, but also insufficient to inherit the legacy of the Premier and continue the great cause of the Three People's Principles. From now on, our party comrades, the party, must eliminate past prejudices based on this, and unite the spirit of one heart and one mind in the future, so as to fulfill the loyal duty of serving the country together. The people of the whole country should also eliminate the civil wars of recent years based on this, and forever lay the true peace and unity of the country, so that we can work together with one heart and one mind, and quell the great difficulties of today, up and down, and create infinite benefits. May all my comrades and compatriots throughout the country encourage each other. This is a sincere statement.</p>
<h3>Student Petition to the Provincial Party Headquarters in Hangzhou</h3>
<p>The Provincial Party Headquarters Stopped the Student Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education, in accordance with the provincial order, approved the letter from the Provincial Party Headquarters, that the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Joint Association of secondary schools and above in Hangzhou City had not</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>been permitted, and was organized without authorization. The various meetings convened by the joint association should be stopped at any time to avoid adverse effects. After receiving the order, the Department of Education immediately relayed it to the authorities of secondary schools and above in the provincial capital, requesting them to pay close attention, and be responsible for dissuading them. This happened a few days ago. The students of secondary schools and above in Hangzhou City were greatly shocked when they saw this, because the national territory has been occupied by violent Japan to such an extent, but the party headquarters and the government have not actually done anything so far. Now even the people's meager patriotic enthusiasm is not allowed to exist, and they really don't know what the intention is. Therefore, today (the 10th) at 8 a.m., more than 5,000 students from various schools above the middle school level gathered to question the Provincial Party Headquarters and demanded that the previous proposal be immediately revoked. Changwu Wei, Xu Shaodi, received them. After the student representatives stated their intentions, Wei Xu promised to ask the Central Government for instructions. The student representatives demanded that the order be immediately revoked and the ban on the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Joint Association of schools above the middle level in Hangzhou City be lifted. The dispute was unresolved. As a result, the students waiting outside the gate rushed in and smashed the doors, windows, glass, and stationery on the desks in the auditorium and offices on the left and right sides. Wei Xu's left eye corner was also slightly injured. It was noon, and after the students left the Provincial Party Headquarters, they went to the Department of Education to petition, but the Department of Education closed its doors and refused to accept them. The students even went to Zhang Gongguan on West Avenue to see Director Zhang. As of press time (3 p.m.), they had not dispersed.</p>

He was detained in the hall for one night and transferred to the Hangzhou Local Court on the morning of the 10th to be severely punished according to law.</p>
<h3>Huzhou</h3>
<p>Notorious Bandit Tang Heshang Captured: Shi Songdian, Zhang Jiliang, and other residents of Baifubu, Changxing County, Huzhou Prefecture, were kidnapped and shot to death by bandits a few days ago. It was later found that the bandit leader was indeed Tang Heshang. The bandit Tang had previously shot and killed a security team detective in Yangfan Zhangzeng and robbed the Changxing Mining Bureau. Bandit Tang was also present at the scene. Commander Shen received a tip-off on the 7th (the other day) that the bandit was hiding in Yangjia near Hongxingqiao. The commander immediately telegraphed the troops stationed in Hongxing to take detectives to conduct a strict search. The bandit dared to lead his men to resist arrest, resulting in a firefight between the two sides, lasting about one hour. Several bandits were killed, and the bandit leader Tang Heshang was captured. He was escorted to the regimental headquarters in the city, strictly guarded, and awaiting interrogation.</p>

Except for the slaughter tax, which has been requested by various county merchants to recognize and handle business taxes in accordance with the previous recognized amount, all pawnshop certificates and long-term yatie certificates held by various yahang, whether the deadline has expired or not, will be uniformly terminated at the end of December of the 20th year of the Republic of China.

<p>Letter</p>
<h3>Letter from the Wuxi County Silk Factory Industry Union</h3>
<p>Dear Sir, I read yesterday in the Local News column of your newspaper, "Wuxi Correspondence," a section about the silk factory union being in dispute due to the audit of accounts. It is completely contrary to the facts and extremely strange. The dispute on that day was caused by representatives from various factories questioning the unfair audit by the audit committee and requesting that Director Chen Peisan be held responsible for privately taking away all the receipts of the new meeting hall. Li Deying and others served as the general representatives for the petition, and the purpose of their petition was based on the above two points. The account of the embezzlement of two or three thousand yuan in your newspaper belongs to the third session, and Hui Jizhi was not serving in the meeting at that time, so of course it has nothing to do with him. This kind of one-sided propaganda is presumably a mistake in transmission. I am sincerely afraid that it will confuse the audience and cause disputes. Therefore, I would like to make a solemn statement based on the facts and hope that you will promptly publish it in the Letter column to formally correct it. The Wuxi County Silk Factory Industry Union,</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Education Department Petitions for Thorough Investigation of Jiangdu County Education Funds (1)</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education submitted a document to Provincial Government Chairman Ye, stating: It has been found that recent disputes in the education sector of various counties, apart from a few counties with special circumstances, generally revolve around requests for higher salaries and the issuance of overdue wages. Tracing the root cause, the trend of demanding salaries and striking is actually the result of extravagant spending and insufficient revenue, leading to an inability to balance income and expenditure. Therefore, after the establishment of this department in the autumn of the 18th year, it immediately urged various counties to prepare education budgets so that income and expenditure could be aligned, and disputes could be eliminated invisibly. Before the 16th year, Jiangdu County's education expenses only required over 8,000 yuan per month. In the 17th year, it increased to over 14,000 yuan, and in the 18th year, it further increased to over 17,000 yuan. Although the budget for that year was prepared and submitted under the supervision of this department, it was too extravagant. It was repeatedly rejected, returned for review, reduced, and rebuilt. However, the bureau chief, Ling Shuxun, was surrounded by teachers and staff and failed to comply. He resigned, citing his own fault. The past year was almost over, but the county's education was still in a state of no budget. After Bureau Chief Chen Da took over, he slightly reduced the amount based on the expenses of the 18th year and reclassified a part of the funding for primary schools as merit pay, compiling the budget for the 19th year. On the surface, it seemed that much had been saved. However, the so-called merit pay was still issued regardless of whether the number of students in each grade was more than 50, resulting in monthly routine expenses of over 16,000 yuan. The routine expenses for each grade in primary schools exceeded 500 yuan. By the spring of the 20th year, the overdue education funds had reached five or six months. The additional tax on land collected in the 19th year was less than 50%, and the turnover was quite sluggish. Therefore, while cleaning up the accumulated deficits, a budget for the 20th year was prepared with further reductions, aiming to align actual revenue with actual expenditure. Unexpectedly, as soon as the budget for the 20th year was approved, all teachers and staff gathered to resist. Later, as the county was facing disasters, they even selected representatives to come to the province to demand the maintenance of the budget amount of the 19th year, claiming that all grades with 30 or 40 students already filling a classroom should be given merit pay, etc. This is the history of the extravagant spending and lack of budget in the county's education funds, and the department's urgent efforts to align income and expenditure.</p>

(Resolution) (a) Immediately telegraph the government that it must not accept under any circumstances; (b) Telegraph the League of Nations to express a vow of opposition, entrust Jiaotong University to draft it and send it out immediately; (c) Demonstrate to the National Government in Nanjing. The last point was pending further discussion due to the presidium issue of the University and Middle School Student Federation.</p>
<p>Letter to the National Government: The conference urgently telegraphed the National Government yesterday afternoon, requesting it to prevent acceptance. The original text is recorded as follows: Urgent and limited, to be received immediately. To the Nanjing National Government: In the League of Nations draft resolution, the clauses on Japan's right to protect overseas Chinese and the authority to dispatch investigation teams allow Japan freedom of military action in areas where Japanese residents are located, and the authority of the investigation team is not restricted by geographical boundaries. This will provide legal protection for Japan's atrocities and plunge our country into an irrecoverable situation. Our association is resolutely opposed. Please urgently telegraph to prevent representatives from accepting. Otherwise, tens of thousands of students will take direct action to oppose the government. Please do not say we did not warn you in advance. The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Federation of University and Middle School Students in Shanghai bows with ashes. At the same time, a telegram was sent to Mr. Shi Zhaoji, our representative in Paris, to express opposition to the above two clauses.</p>

<h3>Women's Basketball Championship Settled, Liangjiang Maintains Class A</h3>
<p>34 to 18 Fierce Battle Against Southeast</p>
<p>Class B Strong East Wins Over Jiangjiang 20 to 9</p>
<p>The Chinese basketball scene, which had been quiet for a long time, was again frenzied last night. The final matches of the Shanghai Women's Basketball Association championship, which are closely related to the championship, resulted in Liangjiang defeating Southeast 34 to 18 in Class A, with Southeast only losing in the final quarter. In Class B, Strong East defeated Jiangjiang 20 to 9. The championships of Class A and Class B will go to Liangjiang and Strong East, respectively, which is now settled. There was also a Class B game in which Daxia defeated Liangliang 19 to 11.</p>
<p>Class B Championship Will Go to Strong East</p>
<p>Strong East and Jiangjiang first came into contact, each qualifying for the final with four wins in four games. As a result, Strong East defeated its strong opponent 20 to 9, and the Class B championship was decided from then on. Referee: Lu Xiangqian.</p>
<p>Smooth Sailing: For the first five minutes of the opening, the offense and defense of both sides were strict and intense, and there was no winner. Jiangjiang's Shang Shuzhen made a free throw for one point, and Strong East's Zhang Zhejun scored a goal. Shang made another free throw. The first quarter was two points to two points. After that, Strong East used good teamwork and tight defense, and sailed smoothly. Jiangjiang was at a loss.</p>
<p>Strong East is Strong Indeed: Strong East is indeed strong. The passing of the forwards is already in accordance with the law, but the shots are too slow, missing many opportunities. Zhang Zhejun's posture is quite impressive. Because of the strength of the defenders, Jiangjiang was overwhelmed. Lu Xueqin, a famous general from Songjiang, is tall and graceful, and she got most of the balls, and her performance was also the best.</p>

<p>Liangjiang Maintains Class A Championship</p>
<p>After Da Dong Liangliang, the Class A final began. Liangjiang broke Southeast in the last quarter, winning 34 to 18. The Class A championship will be maintained for another year. Referee: Zhou Jiaqi</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Liangjiang Met a Strong Opponent. Most people predicted that Liangjiang would win, but they didn't know that there would be such a fierce battle. Southeast's basketball skills have been increasing day by day, and they are lively, agile, and moving. Liangjiang struggled for three quarters, and it was difficult to distinguish between them. Only at the end did they suddenly turn the tide. The coach of Southeast is Zhang Yuansheng, a famous general of Zhongda. It is a matter of time before they win the championship from Liangjiang.</p>
<p>Difficult to Distinguish the Winner in the First Half: In the first half, Southeast took the lead with a score of 3 to 0. Shao Jinying scored two goals and exceeded by one point. In the first quarter, the scores of both sides went up and down by one point. The situation was serious, and the audience held their breath. Liangjiang only led by one point with a score of 8 to 7. At the end of the first half, Liangjiang only led by four points with a score of 16 to 12.</p>
<p>A Sudden Turn in the Second Half: Southeast's Wang Naixin closely guarded Shao Jinying. Although Shao scored with every throw, there were very few opportunities. At the beginning of the second half, Southeast once chased to 18 to 16. As soon as Wang relaxed, Shao scored continuously, and Xi Jun also scored, and the situation took a turn for the worse. Southeast was unable to save the situation.</p>
<p>Shao Jinying is the Pillar of Liangjiang: Liangjiang's victory was only due to Shao Jinying. The magic of her throwing is rare even among men. She scored 24 points alone. Without Shao, they would have long been defeated. Xi Jun has greatly diminished, Wan Rong lacks liveliness, and in addition to the defender Zhuang Wang, there is still one person missing.</p>
<p>Wang Naixin is a Good Defender: Even more striking is Wang Naixin, the great general of the Southeast defense. She is stable, tight, and temporarily unmatched. The appropriateness and suitability of her position is unique in the entire field. The talents of the entire Southeast team are very average. The two guards, Hu and Liu, are also commendable. The forwards are not tall enough and suffer a lot. The teamwork has reached a beautiful level, but the throwing is still inaccurate.</p>

<h3>West Qing Basketball League Jinan Defeats Qingguang</h3>
<p>Result 42 to 31</p>
<p>| Mailing Wins Over Xiaguang 44 to 28</p>
<p>There were two Class A games in the West Qing Basketball League yesterday. The former had a huge difference in strength, while the latter was evenly matched. The competition is described below:</p>
<p>Mailing Wins Over Xiaguang (Class A): Xiaguang's lineup was incomplete (forward Ren Jiexing was injured and rested), and its strength was reduced. In the first five minutes,</p>
<p>Both sides were eyeing each other, and neither side was willing to give in. If people do not offend me, I will not offend others.</p>
<p>Mailing's Laoyi scored a goal, and the war broke out. Looking back, Chen Baoqiu and Guan Dang each scored a goal, and from then on, their arrogance was greatly reduced, and Guan's defenses were repeatedly lost. They trailed 11 to 26 in the first half. In the second half, Mailing's Ma He opened the scoring, leading the way all the way, and the Daxia division was unable to progress. As a result, they lost 28 to 42. Referee: Brat.</p>
<p>Jinan Wins Over Qingguang (Class A): Jinan struck first and scored two goals. Qingguang followed, and the difference was minimal. After each scoring ten points, the situation changed, with Qingguang leading and Jinan following. The first half ended with both sides scoring twenty points each. In the midst of the restart, Qingguang initially took the lead with a score of 26 to 21. Soon, Jinan rose sharply, scoring with most of the shots. At the same time, Qingguang seemed to be cursed, and was repeatedly rejected. After Jinan led 32 to 30, they had a great activity, and the offense and defense were as desired. As a result, they won 42 to 31. Referee: Shao Ji</p>

<h3>Mrs. Maude Departed for America</h3>
<p>Arrived in Shanghai at Noon Yesterday</p>
<p>Set Sail at 8:00 AM This Morning</p>
<p>| Mrs. Maude's Reply Arrived Here Yesterday |</p>
<p>Mrs. Maude is scheduled to leave Shanghai with her husband on the President Coolidge at 8:00 AM this morning to return to the United States. She arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong at 2:30 PM yesterday afternoon and stayed on the ship last night. Because she had to set sail early this morning, Mrs. Maude replied to the Grass Court Tennis Club that she only arrived at 7:00 AM yesterday morning, stating that her time in Shanghai was too short and asking to be excused for not being able to perform. Sadly, we part ways. I am afraid that we will never see Mrs. Maude again in the Far East. How unfortunate for the people of Shanghai to have such a short time to enjoy her performance!</p>

<h3>Memories of a Jeweled Beam</h3>
<p>— Yanzi</p>
<p>Throughout history, foreign troubles have been numerous. The Han Dynasty had the Xiongnu. The Tang Dynasty had Goguryeo. The Song Dynasty had the Liao and Jin. The Ming Dynasty had the Japanese pirates. The coastal areas suffered the trampling of the Japanese pirates, beginning in the early years of Hongwu. Emperor Taizu ordered Tang He to station heavy troops at the corners of the sea to prevent the invasion and occupation by Japanese pirates. However, the defense line extended for hundreds of miles, and although there were heavy troops, it was quite difficult to deploy them. Tang He exhausted his efforts to build three hundred and fifty-three beacon towers along the coast, dispatching soldiers to guard the towers for observation. When Japanese ships approached the beach and landed, they would light fires as signals for mutual support. However, still fearing that the troop strength was insufficient, he recruited fishermen to form fishing corps for training. Over the years, they were successful in resisting the Japanese pirates, and the smoke of war subsided slightly. By the early years of Jiajing, the Japanese pirates were again plotting to plunder. The imperial decree ordered Qi Jiguang to train troops to resist the Japanese pirates.</p>
<p>Following the rules of Xiao He, he fully adhered to Tang He's plans and continued to implement them. The contribution of the fishing corps was not insignificant. Among the fishing corps were the Liao brothers, who were skilled in swimming. They could lie submerged at the bottom of the water, able to see with their eyes open, and moor their boats in the depths of the reeds, waiting in comfort for the enemy. When the Japanese pirates sailed east in giant ships, the Liao brothers jumped into the sea,潜伏under the ships, holding锥子锥子 and piercing the bottoms of the ships, sinking more than ten giant ships. The Japanese pirate chiefs panicked and wanted to flee, and the entire team was in disarray. The fishing boats gathered from all directions to intercept and attack, and more than a hundred Japanese pirates fell into the sea and died. The naval forces, hearing the alarm, came to assist and斬獲無算, and the Japanese ships scattered like birds and beasts. From this one battle, they achieved victory. For forty years, the Japanese pirates did not dare to cross the thunder pool by even one step. Qi Jiguang then attributed the merit to the fishing corps, and presented a detailed account of the battle to the imperial court. He received an imperial decree to be incorporated into the navy to鎮the sea corners. The威名名名of the fishing corps驰驰内外, and the elders of the hometown still praise it to this day.</p>
<p>Talking about the Husband of the Study of Not Removing Garden Grass</p>
<h3>A Teacher's and Parent's Reply丨Freedom is Essential for Growing!</h3>
<p>A special dispatch from Nanjing on the 8th reported that Dai Chuanxian issued an open letter to educators and parents across the country on the 7th of this month, which stated:</p>
<p>"To cultivate a sapling and make it grow into a straight tree, it takes several large pieces of wood to support it on all four sides. To cultivate a good youth, it takes the sacrifice of several adults to support him on all sides. A sapling cannot grow if it is free, and a youth cannot become an adult if he is free. Educators across the country, wake up! Parents, brothers, and sisters of students across the country, wake up! Save the youth who are the lifeblood of the nation! Save the schools that educate the youth! Although I am not worthy of the title of educator, as someone who has been a teacher for more than ten years, I should listen to Mr. Dai's teachings with all of you educators. Moreover, as the father of several young children, I should take responsibility and express my views. Under Mr. Dai's loud call, I have awakened and cannot fall back to sleep. Therefore, I first introduced Mr. Dai's letter to my children, and then expressed my opinions to them, letting them judge for themselves who is right and who is wrong. What I said to them was:</p>
<p>"Do you know about planting trees? If the bottom can take root and the top can emerge, the seedlings can survive. With moisture, fertilizer, air, sunlight, and no pests, the seedlings can grow into large trees. The gardener's responsibility is to irrigate, fertilize, and eliminate pests, without confiscating its free air and sunlight. Then the seedlings will thrive. The trees in the garden for people to admire are supported by dead wood on all sides, and ropes are used to tie them into various curves. These are the tree young masters, because they have tree servants to serve them; some are tree young ladies because their feet are bound and their waists are cinched, much like the girls in the world who do not respect themselves. Tree young masters and tree young ladies are merely playthings for people, and no timber for beams can be found among them. Timber for beams grows in the forest. Can the saplings in the Xing'an Mountains have tree servants to serve them? Who has ever seen them with bound feet and cinched waists? If you want the seedlings to grow straight, it is both difficult and easy. If a small tree grows among large trees, and if the large trees are straight, then the small tree must absorb sunlight upwards, and it will naturally be straight. Isn't this very easy? If the large trees are accustomed to bending over, shading the small trees, and the small trees cannot get sunlight, it would be very difficult for them to be straight. So,</p>
<p>Freedom is Essential for Growing.</p>
<p>Seedlings need to stretch out their heads to breathe free air and feel free sunlight before they can be straight. If we put pressure on the seedlings at the point where they emerge, then unless the seedling is willing to shrink its head into its shell like a turtle, its natural growth force will break through the pressure, just like a chick breaking out of its eggshell is unstoppable.</p>
<h3>Japanese Pirate Graves in Nantong</h3>
<p>— Shuilin</p>
<p>There are two Japanese pirate graves outside Nantong city. They were from the Ming dynasty, when Japanese pirates invaded the coastal regions of our country. Nantong was a major port connecting to the sea, and was therefore also a target of invasion. Those fellows, often numbering in the hundreds, would sail across the sea. As soon as they landed, they would kill anyone they encountered and burn any houses they came across, chasing for dozens of miles before returning laden with plunder. The people of Nantong initially suspected them of being local sea bandits, so they did not know they were Japanese pirates. Later, they became accustomed to it, and they would arrive once or twice a year. Over time, they learned that they were Japanese pirates. What did the people of Nantong do? They set up defenses to resist them. When the pirates invaded again, the people near the villages still fled in the wind. The pirates chased after them, but the militias on the left and right flanks cut off their retreat and sank all their ships. The government troops then launched a frontal attack. The pirates, accidentally encountering a strong enemy, were defeated and returned to their ships, only to find their retreat cut off. They were all殲滅歼灭无一生还. The corpses were gathered and buried, and the place was called the Graves of Japanese Pirates. The following year, they came again. The people of Nantong resisted them as before, and they were all歼灭歼灭 The pirates never came again after those two failures. The graves have been passed down to the present day. Every Qingming and Cold Food Festival, the people of Nantong offer paper money and wheat rice as sacrifices, out of pity for their孤魂异国, no longer remembering the hatred of burning and killing. The size of the graves is such that visitors from other places often mistake them for small hills, not knowing they are Japanese pirate graves. The Nantong Museum still has a great many weapons and armor left behind by the Japanese pirates at that time, for people to pay their respects.</p>
<p>Since the Meiji Restoration in Japan and the opening of our country's sea ban, Japanese visitors, seeing the old sites of Nantong, are all ashamed. They wanted to discuss with the people of Nantong to destroy the graves and collect the artifacts, but the people of Nantong refused, and there was nothing they could do.</p>
<p>The old sites of Japanese pirate raids are not only found in Nantong. There are many along the coast of Zhejiang, but none as prominent as those in Nantong. The way to defend against pirates in various places was only to殲滅歼灭 those who invaded, and there was never any heard of large批部队军队, opening into the Japanese境 to seek仇报. In the Japanese's innate character, the blood of aggression is inherent in their veins. Peace and benevolence are not words found in that nation's dictionary. Now they are waging war without declaring it, occupying our northeast, still unable to shed their barbarian nature.</p>
<h3>Chronicle of World Events</h3>
<p>China's population is so large that it accounts for one-fifth of the world's total population. According to recent Western statistics, the number is 1,900,000,000.</p>
<p>India has many forests and abundant grasses, and wild animals roam among them. Therefore, no less than three thousand Indians are killed by wild animals every year. There are more than 34.4 million telephones worldwide. The United Kingdom uses approximately 2 million.</p>
<p>The famous British physician Dr. Winifred Cullis claims that for women living in densely populated areas, skipping rope and swimming are the best forms of exercise.</p>
<p>The aquarium at the London Zoo has acquired a new species of strange fish. Its eyes sparkle, like two headlights shining in the dark.

<h3>Impressions of the North Station</h3>
<p>— Lu Pin</p>
<p>Amidst the national crisis, I have been to the North Station twice. The first time was when the petition delegation from various universities in Shanghai went to Beijing to petition. I went to the station to see them off. I saw six thousand youths, assembled on the platform. Dressed in uniforms, they stood in orderly ranks and remained silent. I once thought, if these six thousand strong men were to set off for the northeast and go to the front lines to kill the enemy and defend the country, how tragic it would be on the Beijing-Shanghai station. Yesterday afternoon, I went to the North Station again to see off the Volunteer Horse Aid Corps. The illusion from before has now become a reality. Beyond admiration, I cannot help but feel ashamed of myself. Therefore, I write down my impressions to leave a trace, waiting for my comrades to return in triumph, to fill in the blanks in the glorious history.</p>
<h3>Casual Chats at the Zhixiang Studio</h3>
<p>— Gan Yi</p>
<p>Cen Chunxuan (Part 1)</p>
<p>Cen Chunxuan has lived in seclusion in Shanghai for nearly ten years, and is over seventy years old. It seems that he has forgotten the world, and the world has also forgotten him for a long time. Chunxuan, styled Yunjie, his ancestors were originally from Zhejiang, but his grandfather served in Guangdong, so he became a native of Xilin. He passed the xiangju exam and made contributions of grain to become a member of the Ministry of Revenue. Because his father, Yuying, served as the Governor-General of Yunnan and Guizhou and died, he was granted a posthumous honor. Chunxuan obtained a candidate for a fifth-rank capital official. Soon after, he was appointed as the Vice Minister of the Court of Imperial Stud. During the Sino-Japanese War of 1894, Chunxuan angrily requested to join the army. He was assigned by imperial decree to Jiang Governor Liu Kunyi. Chunxuan, as a high-ranking official in the capital, believed that he should not be directed by frontier officials, and had some reservations. He looked at Kunyi's actions to decide his own course of action. Kunyi, judging that the war was not going well, delayed his departure on various pretexts. Chunxuan's enthusiasm had no place to be poured out. After the peace treaty was signed, some people recommended Chunxuan, who was talented and daring, to the court, and he was appointed as the Guangdong Provincial Treasurer. He often clashed with the Governor, Zhao Zhonglin, on matters of state. Chunxuan impeached him, and Zhonglin was eventually dismissed as a result. Chunxuan was also transferred to Gansu. It is rare for a Provincial Treasurer to impeach the Governor. When the Boxer Rebellion broke out, Empress Dowager Cixi and Emperor Guangxu fled the palace to the west. Chunxuan, upon receiving the news, requested Governor Tao Mo to provide troops and funds, saying that the generals should lead troops to serve the Emperor. Mo said, "This is what loyal ministers and righteous men should do." He immediately sent several battalions of patrol troops, reorganized them into an army, and had Chunxuan command them. While the army was on the way, the Empress Dowager and Emperor passed by in a hurry. Chunxuan knelt on the ground and wept, recounting the crimes of the Boxers in harming the country and the pain of the two Palaces being disgraced. He wished to take responsibility for escorting them. The Empress Dowager cried loudly, and the Emperor also cried. The Empress Dowager said, "With you here, what worries or fears do we have?" Upon reaching Xi'an, Chunxuan slept at night in the 行在, and if he heard any voices or sounds, Chunxuan would shout loudly, "Your subject, so-and-so, is here!" The Empress Dowager heard his voice and wept. He was promoted to the Governor of Shaanxi, subtly indicating a reward for his service. Soon after, he was transferred to the Governor of Shanxi, and then promoted to the Governor of Sichuan. Chunxuan was fierce in his administration and strict in his handling of affairs. Officials who broke the law were punished without exception. Later, he was transferred to the Governor of Guangdong. In his use of personnel and administration, he still approached them with authority and enforced the law. Once, he captured a bandit chief in Guangxi, cut open his abdomen, and stored his blood in a cup. He said to the Governor of Guangxi, Ke Fengshi, "Please, Your Excellency, taste this first. Does the taste of bandit blood differ from the blood of good people?" Fengshi was tongue-tied. Chunxuan raised the cup and drank it all in one gulp. Fengshi was shocked and lost his color, saying, "Your Excellency's elegance is indeed extraordinary." Chunxuan was liked by the Empress Dowager, and his power grew stronger. He repeatedly impeached Prince Qing Yikuang for his昏庸误国 and using bribery for personal gain. He also impeached Zhili Governor Yuan Shikai for forming factions, training troops, and interfering in government. Yikuang and Shikai were greatly frightened, and other ministers were all in danger. They rose up to expose his shortcomings. The Empress Dowager had no choice but to transfer him to the Governor of Yunnan and Guizhou. Yunnan and Guizhou were far away on the frontier, with simple administration and barren land. Chunxuan was unhappy with the decree and requested an audience to report matters. The Empress Dowager knew that he would have something to say, and granted it. Upon arriving in Beijing, the Empress Dowager summoned him for an audience. Chunxuan prostrated himself on the ground and cried, recounting the situation of Yikuang and Shikai forming factions and harming the country. The Empress Dowager sighed and said, "Yikuang is old and holds a high title. I will be lenient with him. You should also handle things well. Shikai has the greatest merit among the ministers, but his power makes him an object of resentment. Since you both hold important frontier posts, you should be tolerant." Chunxuan retired, and the Empress Dowager quickly summoned Yikuang, saying, "Cen San is of strong character and has the talent for administration, but he lacks the capacity for tolerance. Impeaching you is not something I can criticize. I have already used gentle words to soothe his anger and resentment. He will be placed in the ranks of the Nine Ministers to assist the central government. Once you are in the same court, you should work together in harmony to support the difficult situation, and the trend of infighting will naturally cease." Yikuang agreed and retreated to visit Chunxuan. He asked about the people's conditions in Guangdong and Guangxi, his words were gentle and his intentions were sincere. The next day, he sent messengers to offer delicacies, further demonstrating his friendliness. Those who heard of Yikuang's condescension thought it strange. The Empress Dowager did not explicitly say it, but in reality, she wanted them to become friends, and Yikuang's alertness was revealed at this point. However, Chunxuan did not move. Every time he had an audience, he would accuse Yikuang of his misdeeds to the Empress Dowager, and the entire court watched with bated breath.</p>
<p>Before the departure, there was a farewell gathering, with the so-called determination to die. Propagandist Wu Mai and a certain socialite from Peiping both went to participate, delivering impassioned speeches that deeply moved people. At that time, there were auctions of clothing and hats to raise funds for the corps. The hearts of the people have not died, and this further confirms it.</p>
<p>All the members of the corps wore single-layered military uniforms, exuding heroism. There were several female members, dressed in the same way as the men. The North China Daily News recently praised Ms. Song Meiqi's joining the army in Beijing as China's Joan of Arc. But in the Youth Horse Aid Corps, China's Joan of Arc is not just one or two people. I wonder if the youths in Shanghai, who are drunk and dreaming their lives away, can not be ashamed of themselves when they search their hearts in the quiet of night. There was a member of the corps who was newly married. A certain gentleman held his hat and bid farewell to his lovely wife, saying casually, "Take care of yourself in Shanghai. I am leaving." After speaking, he turned around and joined the ranks. Upon hearing these words, his wife's tears fell like rain. There was also a member of the corps' mother who went to say goodbye, her face full of tears and her heart broken. These gentlemen are able to leave their wives and mothers to serve the country. Their great personality is truly moving. Therefore, I am happy to record it.</p>
<h3>Recording the Dispersal of Sorrow Amidst the National Crisis</h3>
<p>— Liangyu</p>
<p>Thinking of the national crisis, the worries are endless. The world lacks clear songs, and there is no way to dispel sorrow. Recently, Mr. Shen Zhuoru's granddaughter was married, and there was a performance of Mr. Yu Zhenfei and Mrs. Yingyun's The Selling Horse. Is it the celestial sound of heaven and the magic music of the human world? Therefore, I quickly drove with Pei Zide, Xiao Zhailin, and others to listen. Upon arrival, the stage was performing Mr. Huang Xiubo's Pearl Curtain Village. He was quite similar to Wenru. He performed from the 解寳起to the 收威止, for more than two hours, without letting up. It is not easy to be talented. Then came The Selling Horse. Because it was late, the 哭监was cut. Mr. Yu Zhenfei's portrayal of Zhao Chong was excellent, rarely seen in the opera world. His manners were elegant, and his expressions were delicate, without exception reaching the highest level. When planning, his hands弹纱弹, the five fingers five notes, can be clearly distinguished. It is a unique skill. Mr. Yu's artistry is high, all in 腻而不油, 動而無火. Looking around the north and south, he is the only one. Mrs. Yingyun (i.e., Mrs. Ye Shaoying) her art is not below Old Man Duanwu, but she was slightly ill with a cold, the tone of her voice was not well扬耳. Mr. Hu Yimeng's portrayal of Li Qi, the sound was desolate, and the carving was fine. It is a pity that 监 was not performed, not fully revealing the long performance. Listening quietly to the wonderful playing, I completely forgot the commotion of national affairs. Entrusting my hopes to passionate songs, temporarily dispelling the lump in my chest, it is also a wonderful way to dispel sorrow amidst the national crisis.</p>

<h3>Sharing Hatred with My Son (8)</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter Two: Like-Minded</p>
<p>Zhongshu's mother had already passed away. Mei Guo拥拥着许多姬妾. Therefore, it was difficult for Zhongshu to return to T City. On the contrary, her father often sent people to deliver money and food to her. She studied hard at school day and night. Regarding the aggressive policies of the Sun Country, she felt that they were pressing in. It was very formidable. There was a wild boar in the north and a long serpent in the south. If M Zhou wanted to avoid danger, it must be strong. The classmate who was most compatible with her was Hua Naiqiang. Therefore, the two were close. In her fragrant heart, she felt that Hua Naiqiang was a talented young man. Morality, learning, and skills were all worthy of admiration. Hua Naiqiang was like a magnet, and Zhongshu was like a needle. Naturally, she was attracted to him. And Hua Naiqiang knew that Zhongshu was a巾帼巾帼英雄. Her words and expressions all contained patriotic thoughts, which could not be compared with ordinary women. It was rare for her to be able to cast a glance at him, and naturally considered her as a confidante. Moreover, Hua Naiqiang was an orphan, and had no siblings. He was alone and isolated. It was comforting to have this pure-hearted person with him morning and evening. The emotions of the two were naturally particularly strong. Once, the hot wind was scorching. It was the summer vacation. Zhongshu had some matters to attend to back in T City. Hua Naiqiang had no home to return to, and lived at school all year round. Zhongshu asked him if he was willing to visit T City and stay at her home for a few days. Hua Naiqiang had nothing to do, and readily agreed. So he packed his bags, brought many of the books he often read, and accompanied Zhongshu to T City. Zhongshu then introduced Hua Naiqiang to her father. Mei Guo knew that he was his daughter's classmate, and naturally extended an invitation. In his spare time, he talked with him. Hua Naiqiang felt that Mei Guo was greedy for sensuality and profit, and had no knowledge in his chest. His personality was barbaric. This kind of soldier could not serve the country. When it came to the affairs of the Sun Country, he was even more isolated, fearing Shu like a tiger. What proper words could he say to him? Every day he saw him eating, drinking, and making merry. What made him most impatient was that Mei Guo had a fifth concubine, who often accompanied him for drinking. Once, for some unknown reason, she offended him. Mei Guo was so angered that his animalistic nature arose. He took a horsewhip and beat the concubine all over her body, causing her to roll on the ground, weeping哀哀. But Mei Guo's anger did not subside. He pulled out a gun and wanted to end her life. Fortunately, Zhongshu came over to dissuade him. However, the concubine was already covered in wounds. Hua Naiqiang was very闷闷. According to his nature, he should have stepped forward to help and remonstrated with Mei Guo for being too inhumane. But because he was a guest, and also out of respect for Zhongshu, he had to pretend not to see or hear.</p>

<p>Afternoon Market: Extremely Strong Selling Pressure. The afternoon market started off well at ninety-one and a half taels, which was due to the goods opening large. Then it fell back to eighty-nine taels. It recovered to ninety-two and a half taels due to purchases from the Dalian Gang. Afterward, it appeared to move downstream. Yuanmaoyong, Zhifengyong, Fuyu, and others sold. The Dalian Gang sold again, pushing the price up further with American dollars at six two five to eight seven five and British pounds at five six two five to seven five. Finally, at two forty-five, Bombay rose eleven annas, causing even greater fear. At three o'clock, it was eighty-five taels and five qian. Wanxing and Shunli absorbed again, with HSBC absorbing four-month British pounds at six two five and Zhejiang absorbing American dollars at eight one two five. After three thirty, it was ninety taels and eight qian. From then on, trading was mixed, and the situation was vague, with two taels of advances and retreats. At four o'clock, selling pressure rose again. Fuyu, Qianchangxiang, Hengchangyong, and others all competed to sell. Near-term British pounds could be settled at eight seven five and American dollars at eight one two five to eight seven five, causing the price to fall by six taels. With only two xueresiduals, the market suddenly became eighty-four taels and five at closing at four thirty.

<h3>&lt;The Wheat Market Presents a Bleak Scene P]</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market as a whole presented a desolate picture. Although foreign wheat was reported to have fallen by four, five, six, or seven "jiao," due to the unstable situation, neither buyers nor sellers were interested in trading. Therefore, throughout the day, prices fluctuated by only a cent or two in each session. However, the final result was exactly the same as the previous day, without the slightest change. This kind of scene was truly rare before the end of the year. Observing future trends, it is feared that due to the lack of support from flour sales, fluctuations will be unavoidable.</p>
<p>Sugar Market:</p>
<p>Raw and White Granulated Sugar Falls Again</p>
<p>Taikoo Sugar Remains Stable</p>
<p>Yesterday, sugar market reports from producing areas indicated that the current price of Cuban raw sugar was 1.15625, a decrease of 0.03125 compared to the previous report. New York futures prices were 1.04 for December, 1.06 for March of next year, 1.11 for May, and 1.24 for September. Compared to the previous report, only the May and September contracts fell by one cent each, with no changes in other months. Current and futures prices for Javanese sugar also remained stable without fluctuations. In the public market, transactions for Dutch No. 24 raw and white granulated sugar were very scarce, with extremely quiet buying interest. As a result, market prices fell again, with transaction prices reaching 9 taels and 9 qian and a half. No. 20 medium granulated white sugar was priced at 9 taels and 8 qian and a half, and No. 20 finely ground granulated white sugar was priced at 9 taels, 8 qian, and 7 and a half fen. The trend remained weak. Taikoo sugar prices also declined slightly: B mark at 11 taels, 7 qian and a half to 2 and a half fen; DY mark at 11 taels and 7 qian; HX mark at 11 taels and 6 qian; HM mark at 11 taels, 4 qian, 2 and a half to 4 fen. The market outlook still felt stable. Huaxin Company sold 100 bags of B mark sugar at a price of 11 taels and 7 qian and 2 and a half fen, and CW mark sugar was offered at 11 taels and 6 qian and a half, but there were few takers.</p>
<p>A Panoramic View of the Sluggish Fabric Market</p>
<p>The fabric market has recently been experiencing a significant downturn. As the end of the lunar year approaches, local merchants are mostly closing their books, and those holding goods are eager to sell them off. Therefore, they are willing to lower prices step by step, hoping to attract buyers. However, the market remains stagnant. Merchants from Sichuan, Hankou, Wenzhou, Taizhou, Ningbo, and other regions are facing severe financial constraints and an unstable overall situation, making it difficult for the market to recover in the short term. Some domestic wool, crepe, and serge fabrics have been shipped to Guangdong, Shantou, Xiamen, and other ports, but the volume is still much lower than last month. Tianjin has been completely inactive since the Japanese disturbances. In Shandong Province, except for Yantai, eastern goods are circulating smoothly, so there have been some shipments from Shanghai in recent days. Apart from some transactions in retail stores in the local market, business is sparse, like stars at dawn. The dullness of the trend is unprecedented. Auction houses have stopped auctioning because of the continuous price declines. White cloth has fallen by about one or two taels. Coarse cloth is falling every day, with 13-pound goods having fallen by 6 taels. Among 11-pound goods, the "Cat" brand is the softest, while the "Three Chickens" and "Treasure Basin" brands of 9-pound cloth have fallen to 4 taels and 7 qian. Fine cloth and fine twill are moving very little. The decline in colored striped flannel is also severe. Western-made 1.6-yuan flannel has plummeted by about one "qian" per yard, resulting in a loss of over one hundred taels per box. Stocked goods remain sealed. It is likely that future payments will be difficult to settle. Those involved in this business are all suffering losses, which is indeed a result of being blinded by profit.</p>
<p>Sales of Bead Serge are Nothing Like They Used to Be</p>
<p>Bead head overcoating serge was a popular overcoating material for winter, especially the navy blue color two or three years ago, and it was an indispensable woolen fabric for serge shops. However, as with all things, there must be a reversal. In recent years, the sales of this serge have been very sluggish. No local merchants are trading in entire boxes, and the market downturn is like a fall of a thousand feet. Fortunately, the arrival of goods is limited, and sales prices have not plummeted sharply. However, compared to the opening prices, they have already fallen by several "qian" of silver. Currently, most of the stock in Shanghai is in muted colors. Yesterday, Wufeng and Gongping navy blue bead head overcoating serge were being sold at 3 taels and 0.05 (3 qian, 5 fen), while Taihe and Anli, etc. were selling at 4 taels and 2 qian 5 fen to 4 taels and 6 or 7 qian.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea Factories Remain Weak</p>
<p>Yesterday, foreign silk firms in Shanghai still saw no possibility of progress. Although merchants held onto stocks of silk, they were eager to sell. However, European and American firms continued to suppress prices and purchase, resulting in few sales. Yesterday, only Samsung imported a small batch of fine silk, and Taihe, etc. imported 20 packages of bleached dried silk. Prices remained weak.</p>
<p>Zhenmei and Pearl Tea Sales to Europe Are Still Smooth</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the Shanghai tea market, foreign firms, such as Jardine Matheson and Tongfu, continued to search for and buy Zhenmei, Zhenmei needle, Xia Mu, and other low-grade green teas. Transactions were quite active, and market prices were firm. However, although sales of these exportable green teas have revived in the Moroccan market in recent days, inventory is low, resulting in supply falling short of demand. Sales of high-grade Zhenmei green tea remain sluggish.</p>
<p>Yellow and White Silk Waste Exports are Scarce</p>
<p>Recently, exports of yellow and white silk waste have declined daily. Overseas Japanese silk fluff has been priced so cheaply, resulting in weakening European sales of our country's silk waste. The mail ship "Mailechen" exported a total of only 25 pieces of yellow and white long silk waste to Mumbai the day before yesterday.</p>

<p>Local News</p>
<p>Mayor Zhang Cables to the Capital, Offering His Resignation</p>
<p>Missing Peking University Student Xu Xiucen Has Been Found</p>
<p>Public Tribunal Questions the Assailant, Who Confesses to Accomplices</p>
<p>A large group of petitioning students left the Municipal Government yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>Two representatives from Peking University and Zhongshan University who had come to Shanghai were suddenly beaten and kidnapped a few days ago. One assailant, Wang Fusheng, was apprehended; details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. Students from various universities in the city then staged an all-night vigil at the Municipal Government on Maple Bridge on the night before last (the 8th), demanding that the assailants be handed over, the arrested Peking University representative Xu Xiucen (also known as Hongjun) be released, Chen Xizeng be dismissed and punished, and Tao Baichuan and others be arrested within a time limit. They vowed not to return until their demands were met. The Mayor accepted each demand, dispatched Secretary-General Yu Hongjun to investigate the whereabouts of Xu Hongjun, and Secretary Geng Jiaji summoned Wang Fusheng for questioning. Both were successively located at the Water Patrol and the Local Court and brought to the scene. The students immediately organized a public tribunal to severely interrogate the assailant, who confessed to the facts. Peking University representative Xu Xiucen also reported the ordeal. The Mayor also took responsibility for the handling of Chen Xizeng and Tao Baichuan, promising to apprehend them within three days. Mayor Zhang himself admitted to negligence and cabled the Central Government the night before last, offering his resignation. However, as of 3:00 PM yesterday, no approval had been received from the Central Government, so he resubmitted the cable to the Central Government last night, firmly offering his resignation. The entire student body withdrew at 2:00 PM. Additionally, yesterday morning (the 10th) at 9:00 AM, the Joint Association of Anti-Japanese National Salvation of Universities and Secondary Schools held a joint meeting at Jiaotong University to discuss the matter. As the person had been released and everything had been resolved satisfactorily, there were no other actions taken. However, it was resolved to launch another large-scale demonstration and to telegraph the National Government and the League of Nations to oppose recognition of Japan's right to protect overseas Chinese in China and the League of Nations' investigation team. Details are recorded below.</p>
<p>The Situation at the Municipal Government Yesterday (Taken by This Newspaper)</p>
<p>Rescuing the Representative</p>
<p>Municipal Government Secretary-General Yu Hongjun, on the order of the Mayor, was required to solve the case of the kidnapping of Peking University representative Xu Xiucen within a time limit. He immediately began searching in all directions at 4:00 AM yesterday and rescued him from the Public Security Bureau's Water Patrol. Together with Secretary-General Yu, they arrived at the Municipal Government by car at 9:37 AM. The students petitioning there applauded and shouted "Long Live!" They escorted Xu Xiucen onto the stage to report the ordeal. Xu said, "Yesterday morning, after reporting the arrest of the Peking University demonstration group at the Junior Propaganda Team in Xiaoximen, at 3:00 PM, Jiang Fangye of Zhongshan University and I were walking out when, at the entrance on Zhonghua Road, more than twenty plainclothes detectives, armed with pistols, forced me into a car and took me away. First, I was taken to the Inspection Department of the Public Security Bureau, then to the Third Section, and finally to the Public Security Bureau's Water Patrol in Dongjiadu, which was already after 10:00 PM. The boat sailed midstream, seemingly towards Pudong, but then returned to the Dongjiadu pier. Secretary-General Yu disembarked and, on the order of the Mayor, came to rescue me. I immediately took a car here with him. Finally, I would like to thank my fellow students for their rescue efforts. Fortunately, I was not injured." Later, he was escorted home by Tongji and other schools.</p>
<p>The Petition Disperses</p>
<p>The students from various schools who went to the Municipal Government to petition at 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, a total of more than 5,000 people, stood there until 10:00 AM yesterday before dispersing. In the interim, as the thousands of students had arrived at the Municipal Government in the afternoon of the day before yesterday, and Mayor Zhang had promised to find the Peking University representative but had not done so by 4:00 or 5:00 AM yesterday, they did not disperse. After 8:00 AM, even more people went to the Municipal Government to petition, with Fudan and Daxia Universities arriving later. Finally, at 9:30 AM yesterday morning, the students from various universities, satisfied that the Peking University representative had been released and that the Mayor's response was complete, considered the matter resolved and marched out in formation at 11:00 AM.</p>
<p>The Situation of the Summons</p>
<p>Municipal Government Secretary Geng Jiaji, after being ordered to deliver the criminal, drove to the Public Security Bureau to inquire. Later, because the Public Security Bureau had transferred the case to the Local Court, he transferred to the Local Court to transport them there. By then it was 3:00 AM. Initially, the court, because the person in charge was not present, waited until 5:00 AM, when the original recipient, Prosecutor Wu, arrived and handed them over to be taken back. When they arrived at the Municipal Government to hand them over to the public tribunal, it was 8:00 AM.</p>
<p>Organizing the Tribunal</p>
<p>After Secretary Geng Jiaji of the Municipal Government moved out from the Local Court, the student delegation, at the second meeting, decided to organize a provisional public pre-trial tribunal. The method of its formation was the joint organization of representatives from five schools and the Municipal Government sending two representatives, and the election of one clerk and one presiding judge. The list is as follows: Presiding Judge, Ji Shiyuan of the Political Science Department; Examining Magistrate, Wu Yuncong of the Law School; Wu Shumo of Fudan University; Hong Daji of the Academy of Fine Arts; Wu Banghe of Jiaotong University; Sun Baorong and Guo Shen of the Municipal Government; Clerk, Xiao Huaigu of Daxia University. In addition, twenty members of the militia were sent from Daxia and Fudan to serve as judicial police, totaling forty people.</p>
<p>The Assailant's Confession</p>
<p>After the Provisional Public Pre-trial Tribunal was established at about 10:00 AM yesterday, it immediately opened its first court in the Municipal Government's reception room and summoned the assailant Wang Fusheng for questioning. The transcript of his confession is recorded below:</p>

After the confession, with the consent of the presiding judge of the Provisional Public Pre-trial Tribunal, the assailant was sent to the Shanghai Municipal Hospital in Nanshi by car, residing in Ward 3, Room 4, and four armed police officers were dispatched by the Municipal Public Security Bureau to monitor him in the hospital for security. According to the hospital's doctor, the assailant's injuries are not serious and he will soon recover fully, with no risk to his life.</p>
<p>Mayor's Resignation</p>
<p>Mayor Zhang, recognizing his own negligence, immediately submitted a request to the Central Government for his resignation the night before last. The original cable read: "Urgent, to the Executive Yuan of the Nanjing National Government: Since the Shenyang Incident occurred eighty days ago, public sentiment has been agitated, growing stronger with time. Shanghai is a key port for trade between China and foreign countries and the cultural center of the country. Even the slightest disturbance affects the entire situation. I have always kept in mind the heavy trust placed in me by the Central Government and the earnest expectations of the citizens, and I have strived to maintain local security and sincerely guide the patriotic citizens, hoping to bring the people back on track and ensure the peace and tranquility of the citizens. However, due to my heavy responsibilities and limited abilities, I have been unable to sleep well and have not been able to contribute to overcoming these difficult times. Now, the youth are driven by righteous indignation, and the student movement is growing daily. Conciliation has been ineffective, and measures have been difficult to implement. I realize that my knowledge is shallow and I am at a loss to deal with the situation, to the point where local order is difficult to maintain. Therefore, I am baring my heart, admitting my guilt, and impeaching myself. I respectfully request that you consider this matter, immediately dismiss me, and send high-ranking officials to Shanghai to investigate the situation. I am trembling and awaiting orders." Zhang Qun kowtows.</p>
<p>Mayor Zhang, having waited until yesterday afternoon and not yet receiving approval from the Central Government, sent another cable to the Central Government last night, earnestly requesting his resignation. The original cable was sent out last night.</p>
<p>Party Headquarters Suspends Operations</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters of the Kuomintang, located on Linin Road in Ximen, was stormed at 6:00 PM the day before yesterday because students and faculty from Fudan University went to petition for the rescue of Peking University representatives. As the responsible personnel had all gone out and there was no one to receive them, it was assumed that the mastermind behind this was Standing Committee member Tao Baichuan. Under the influence of agitation and large numbers of people, the general affairs, propaganda, organization, investigation, training, and other departments of the Party Headquarters, the Standing Committee member's office, the Supervisory Committee member's office, and the auditorium were all vandalized. Only the Civil Training Department and the Record Room were spared because the duty officers, seeing that the situation was bad, tightly closed the windows and doors. The Party Headquarters was forced to temporarily suspend operations and reported the damage to the Central Government for a thorough investigation.</p>
<p>Continuing the Petition</p>
<p>After the students from various universities returned to their schools in formation, at about 11:00 AM on the morning of the 10th, more than 500 students from Chung Kuo University arrived because martial law had been declared in Wusong on the 9th. Secretary-General Yu Hongjun of the Municipal Government reported the rescue efforts of the Mayor. Students from Modern Secondary School, Wensheng School, British Vocational School, and others also arrived, and the Mayor personally reported the situation. The students made requests, which the Mayor answered one by one. The students were satisfied and shouted slogans before dispersing in formation at 2:30 PM.</p>
<p>Students Leave the Municipal Government</p>
<p>Before dispersing, the students asked Mayor Zhang what he would do about this matter and how he would punish Chen Xizeng and Tao Baichuan. Mayor Zhang replied, "I was not aware of this matter. However, when I asked Chen Xizeng, Chen said that there was no such thing, which was deliberately misleading. I was also deceived by him. Chen's lack of action was a dereliction of duty and must be punished. Tao Baichuan is highly suspected and has avoided meeting with me since the incident. I will report this to the Central Government for handling. I am also reporting to the Central Government to request punishment for my lack of competence." At that time, many students shouted to retain Mayor Zhang and asked him to arrest Chen and Tao. Mayor Zhang said that he would be responsible for arresting Chen and Tao within three days before they cheered, "Long live the people's movement!" and dispersed.</p>
<p>Three Requests</p>
<p>On the day the students dispersed, many representatives of the Student Union went to the Municipal Government to petition, not knowing that Peking University representative Xu Xiucen had been released, making three requests: (1) Immediately release the arrested Peking University students; (2) Execute Public Security Bureau Director Chen Xizeng; (3) Execute the assailant and the mastermind. Mayor Zhang replied: (1) I had negotiated with the Public Security Bureau this morning at 10:00 AM to release the Peking University representative and meet with the students. (2) I have cabled the Central Government and have ordered him to be suspended from duty pending investigation. (3) If there is evidence that Tao Baichuan violated the law, I will arrest him and hand him over for strict punishment within three days. The Student Union representatives asked Mayor Zhang to request the Central Government to dismiss all the executive supervisory committee members of the Municipal Party Headquarters for investigation. Zhang agreed to cable the request and immediately sent a telegram, which read:</p>
<p>Chen and Tao Relocate</p>
<p>Public Security Bureau Director Chen Xizeng, who lived on Xiafei Road in West Shanghai, moved his entire family elsewhere after being suspended from duty. His whereabouts remain unknown. Municipal Party Headquarters Director Tao Baichuan also moved from his original residence in Dachung Lane, Tongfu Road, after receiving the news. Therefore, the People's Tribunal could not find them when they went to summon them. Their whereabouts are unknown. Yesterday, it was heard that both had gone to Beijing, but confirmation is still pending.</p>
<p>Request for Dismissal</p>
<p>The night before last, after Mayor Zhang agreed to suspend Public Security Bureau Director Chen Xizeng, the students continued to demand that he be dismissed and investigated. Mayor Zhang replied that this matter had to be reported to the Central Government and agreed to report to the Central Government to request dismissal and investigation. The original report stated that Shanghai Public Security Bureau Director Chen Xizeng was negligent and derelict in his duties regarding the beating of Peking University student representative Xu Xiucen and Zhongshan University representative Jiang Fangye on the 9th of this month and did not thoroughly investigate the matter afterward. It was requested that he be dismissed and investigated.</p>
<p>After Chen's Departure</p>
<p>In the Public Security Bureau yesterday, Director Chen Xizeng did not go to the bureau to work because he had been ordered to be suspended from duty. All affairs were handled by Chief Inspector Wang Yuwen. The staff in the Secretariat and various sections continued to work as usual. The various districts and bureaus also worked as usual and dispatched Section Chief Song Jintao of the Third Section to the Municipal Government at 11:00 AM to report the assailant's confession and the aftermath. While the Peking University representative had not returned, the Public Security Bureau had instructed the various districts, bureaus, branches, and police stations to state in the instructions that, according to the university student representatives, a certain Peking University student had suddenly disappeared after a meeting at the Junior Propaganda Team this afternoon. Please investigate and report on the whereabouts of the Peking University student. This order is urgent.</p>
<p>Special Martial Law</p>
<p>After the arrest of the student representatives, and the Zhenru Road bridge was burned, the Municipal Public Security Bureau announced special martial law on the night of the 9th. At 12:00 AM, traffic was cut off in Nanshi, Zhabei, West Shanghai, and Pudong. The French Concession authorities closed the iron gates along Xiejia Bridge, Nanyang Bridge, and the Republic Road. Barbed wire was deployed in Lujiawan and other places. The Public Concession authorities also dispatched a large number of armed Chinese and foreign detectives to be stationed at the borders between the Chinese and foreign concessions. Although special martial law has been lifted, ordinary martial law is still in effect.</p>
<p>Professors' Declaration</p>
<p>The Shanghai University Professors' Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association's declaration on the kidnapping and beating of students stated that the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters has been interfering in the people's movement under the guise of guidance for a long time. Since the outbreak of the current Anti-Japanese National Salvation Movement, the Party Headquarters has been acting perversely and intensifying its actions. On the 9th of this month, it colluded with the Public Security Bureau to deploy detectives and instigated thugs to kidnap Peking University student representative Xu Hongjun and beat Zhongshan University student representative Jiang Miansun. The Party and government organs of this city are engaging in such bandit-like behavior, which is despicable and malicious to the extreme. If we do not rise up to oppose this, not only will our patriotic rights be deprived, but the people of our country will have no peace. In order to uphold righteousness, this association advocates that, in addition to having already requested the arrest of the main offenders in this case, Tao Baichuan and Chen Xizeng, all accomplices involved in this case should also be arrested and severely punished according to law, as a warning to those who undermine the national patriotic movement. This declaration is issued, hoping that all sectors will urgently rise up and unanimously advocate this.</p>
<p>County Association's Condolences</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association was outraged by the unwarranted arrest of Peking University student representative Xu Bingcen and the beating and injury of Zhongshan University student representative Jiang Fangye. This morning, it dispatched Association Chairman Jiang Yanchou and Standing Committee member Lv Zhe to express their condolences and pledge their support.</p>
<p>University Professors' Anti-Japanese Association Opposes League of Nations Resolution</p>
<p>Insisting on Withdrawal of Troops Before Investigation</p>
<p>The Shanghai University Professors' Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association cabled the Nanjing National Government, stating, "To the Nanjing National Government: The League of Nations' resolution does not order Japan to withdraw its troops by a deadline, but plans to send an investigation team with no clear scope, which is completely biased towards Japan. Please immediately instruct Representative Shi to refuse to accept this and insist on the principle of withdrawal of troops before investigation."</p>
<p>Sun Ke and Others Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday for Important Meetings</p>
<p>Guangdong Takes Chiang Kai-shek's Resignation as a Principle</p>
<p>Transitional Measures Are Being Negotiated</p>
<p>Guangdong representatives Sun Ke, Li Wenfan, Wu Chaoshu, Chen Youren, and others arrived in Shanghai on the President Coolidge yesterday afternoon. Those who came with them included Tan Zhen, Fu Bingchang, Zeng Zhongming, Liang Hancao, Jian Youwen, Wen Jiangang, Chen Jianru, Fu Rulin, Wang Kunlun, Yu Ming, Tang Chengbo, and more than thirty others. The President Coolidge berthed on the Jiangmian River at Lan Road, Yangshupu, at about 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon. The greeters departed from the New Customs Wharf at 1:00 PM by ferry and boarded the ship at about 2:00 PM. After greeting Sun Wu and others, they disembarked on a special small boat and landed on the Bund of Avenue Edward VII, French Concession, and returned to their private residences to rest.</p>
<p>Sun's Residence Meeting</p>
<p>At 4:00 PM yesterday, six Guangdong representatives, including Wang Jingwei, Zou Lu, Sun Ke, Li Wenfan, Wu Chaoshu, and Chen Youren, and Chen Mingshu, a representative from Nanjing, met at Sun Ke's residence on Molie Ai Road to discuss the convening of the Fourth National Congress and Chiang Kai-shek's resignation, among other issues. They dispersed at 6:30 PM without any concrete results. The two sides held another meeting in the evening. Chen cabled Nanjing that night to ask for instructions.</p>
<p>Sun Ke (left) and Chen Renyou (right) who arrived in Shanghai yesterday (taken by this newspaper).</p>
<p>Insisting on Principles</p>
<p>This newspaper's reporter interviewed Wu Chaoshu at his residence yesterday. According to Wu, Guangdong takes Chiang Kai-shek's resignation as a principle; otherwise, the various committee members will not go to Nanjing. The selection of ten committee members in Shanghai will have remedial measures in the future. Mr. Hu Zhantang is temporarily staying in Hong Kong for convalescence due to illness and may not be able to come to Shanghai for a while.</p>
<p>Transitional Measures</p>
<p>It is heard that during the meeting at Sun's residence yesterday, Chen Mingshu indicated that Chiang Kai-shek's resignation was not a problem. If there is someone responsible in the central authorities, he can leave at any time. The focus now should be on discussing transitional measures. As for the transitional period and personnel selection, Guangdong insists on the appointment of personnel agreed upon by the Guangdong Fourth National Congress. The date of the convening of the First Plenary Session was also mentioned, and it was agreed that it should be expedited, but no decision was made.</p>
<p>Sun Ke's Talk</p>
<p>According to Sun Ke, today's meeting was only for both sides to report on their respective situations and exchange opinions on the timing of the first meeting of the Fourth Central Executive Committee. The Guangdong committee members decided to base their decisions on the resolutions of the Guangdong Fourth National Congress. Only after Mr. Chiang Kai-shek's resignation and the implementation of a transitional plan will they agree to go to Nanjing to attend the meeting. However, according to Mr. Chen Zhenru, Mr. Chiang will make a decision and resign at any time after the Fourth Central Committee meeting resolves the matter. Regarding the convening of the meeting, both sides hope that it will be realized as soon as possible. If the transitional measures are resolved, it will take at least a week for the committees to travel to Nanjing, exchanging correspondence and telegrams.</p>
<p>Page 14</p>
<p>The matter of selecting the Central Committee members in Shanghai was not discussed today and will be left to the first meeting of the Fourth Central Executive Supervisory Committee. The Guangdong Fourth National Congress has resolved to mobilize troops to the Northeast to assist Ma Zhanshan and has planned to dispatch the First and Fourth Army Groups. Once all matters are settled, they can set off.</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei Initiates the Organization of the National Salvation Congress</p>
<p>Ning and Guangdong Both Send Representatives to Participate</p>
<p>Preparatory Meeting Should Be Held in Shanghai to Deal with National Crisis</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei sent a telegram yesterday to advocate the organization of the National Salvation Congress: "To all Party Headquarters, governments, people's organizations, and newspapers in the country: The biggest purpose of the meeting of representatives from both Ning and Guangdong in Shanghai this time is to resolve disputes over party and political affairs in order to jointly address the national crisis. On November 7, resolutions were reached on various matters, but they have not been implemented to this day. On the Guangdong side, joint meetings of the Central Executive and Supervisory Committees have repeatedly sent telegrams stating that the meeting has already been decided and that they will not go to Ning to attend the First Plenary Session until Mr. Chiang Kai-shek implements his resignation as originally agreed. They will continue to establish a Central Party Headquarters in Guangzhou for the time being. On the Nanjing side, it is said that the issue of government reorganization must be resolved at the First Plenary Session, which must be held in Ning. Although there is talk of reorganizing the government in advance, it has not yet materialized. If this stalemate continues, unification will not be achieved and the purpose of jointly addressing the national crisis will not be fulfilled. This is not only a cause for pain for all comrades in the party, but also a cause for concern for the people of the country, who cannot find peace for a single day. I believe that the purpose of political tutelage is to train the people to exercise political power. Therefore, during the period of political tutelage, although the power to organize the government belongs to the Kuomintang, the people's representative organs cannot be neglected. For several years, the majority of comrades, based on the Three Principles of the People and the Declaration of the National Congress, have advocated that the people's private rights should be protected by law, while political power should be gradually increased in order to achieve the goal of democratic politics. Now, with the national crisis at hand, it is difficult to predict the future. Whether we speak of war or peace, we must have the people of the country unite to bear the burden of humiliation. In order to cope with the national crisis, we must strive to cooperate with the people. Otherwise, the Party Headquarters and the government will become increasingly distant from the people. How can we stand on our own? How can we face foreign enemies? This is something that all comrades in Ning and Guangdong should deeply consider. I believe that we should immediately launch a National Salvation Congress, with representatives from people's organizations participating in the organization, so that they can fully express their views and methods for dealing with the national crisis. At the same time, Ning and Guangdong should send representatives to participate. In this meeting, we must abandon confrontational attitudes and calmly discuss ways to jointly address the national crisis. In order to make this meeting a reality as soon as possible, we should first organize a preparatory meeting in Shanghai. In this way, the idea of reorganizing the government in advance, if it can be realized immediately, can resolve the disputes over party and political affairs. Otherwise, it will not hinder the progress of national salvation. Even if all comrades in the party unite, the National Salvation Congress must have representatives from people's organizations participating in order to jointly defend against the national crisis and establish the foundation of democratic politics. What I have stated here is only a beginning. If you agree, I will continue to elaborate on the organizational plan and detailed rules for selection. I hope you will consider this."</p>
<p>The Guangdong Extraordinary Congress Concludes</p>
<p>Members of the Central Party Headquarters Have Been Nominated</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Jingwei previously received two telegrams from Guangdong reporting that the Extraordinary Congress had concluded and that the Central Party Headquarters had been reorganized on the 7th. The text of his telegrams is copied above: (1) "To Mr. Jingwei: Our side's Fourth Executive Supervisory Committee held a temporary joint meeting and resolved to end the Extraordinary Congress on the 7th and reorganize the Central Party Headquarters on the 8th, establishing the Executive Supervisory Committee with the following nominees: Wang Jingwei, Hu Hanmin, Sun Ke, Ju Zheng, Jing Hengyi, Chen Jitang, Bai Chongxi, Shi Qingyang, and Wu Chaoshu were nine temporary Standing Committee members of the Executive Committee, and Tang Shaoyi, Xiao Focheng, Deng Zeru, Li Zongren, and Xiang Hanping were five temporary Standing Committee members of the Supervisory Committee. Until Chiang implements his resignation and relinquishes military power, they will continue to exercise their powers as usual." Telegram from the Joint Meeting of the Fourth Central Executive Supervisory Committee. (2) "To Mr. Jingwei: Our side's Fourth Executive Supervisory Committee has already elected members and decided at the joint meeting to temporarily establish a Central Party Headquarters in Guangdong. Only after Chiang Kai-shek implements his resignation and relinquishes military power will our side go north to participate in the first meeting of the Fourth Central Committee." Telegram from the Joint Meeting of the Fourth Central Executive Supervisory Committee.</p>
<p>Restoration of the Zhenru Railway</p>
<p>All Trains Run as Usual</p>
<p>At the Zhenru Station on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, Bridge No. 5 was burned and the tracks, telephone lines, and telegraph lines were cut off at 10:00 PM the night before last, causing passenger trains to be blocked. It was not until 4:40 AM yesterday (the 9th) that repairs were completed and traffic resumed. The various situations are recorded below:</p>
<p>The Truth at the Time</p>
<p>At about 10:00 PM on the night before last (the 9th), after the students received the news of the disappearance of the Peking University representative and the beating and serious injury of the Zhongshan University representative, in addition to a portion of the group rushing to the Municipal Government to petition, the entire militia went to Zhenru Station, which was temporarily noisy, to maintain order. Suddenly, the No. 5 railway bridge on the west side of Zhenru Station on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Tight in Appearance, Relaxed in Reality</h3>
<p>First Cause Chinese Merchants to Dump... to Profit from "Stripping"</p>
<p>Yesterday, silver markets in England, the United States, and India all reported declines. European markets were weak due to a lack of buyers. The exchange rate between the British pound and the US dollar continued to rise, reaching 3 shillings, 2 pence, and 8.75/100ths of a penny. The US dollar rate against the pound was 3 shillings, 2 pence, and 0.25/100ths of a penny. The Shanghai market, initially tight, eased. HSBC reduced its pound sterling quotation by one notch, to 25, equivalent to 1 shilling and 11 pence. The US dollar only fell by 1.25/100ths, to 31.375 yuan, due to large exchange rate differences. Hong Kong reduced by 0.25/100ths, to 76.25 taels. Other quotations were also reduced. However, internal bank rates were strong in the morning, then weakened, especially in the afternoon. As a result, compared to the day before, pound sterling rose by 0.25/100ths and the US dollar by 0.5625/100ths, suggesting a trend of tight appearance but relaxed reality. As for the gold market, due to rumors that the United States would propose abandoning the gold standard, confidence wavered, which affected exchange rates. Most Chinese merchants dumped, mainly to profit from "stripping," with the "stripping" price being close, about 40 taels or so. It is estimated that 200,000 to 300,000 pounds sterling were traded, with a few buyers occasionally stepping in. About one million plus several hundred thousand US dollars were traded, with much interbank trading reported.</p>

The forward rate also fell by 9.375 pence, to 19 shillings and 9.375 pence. The "feet-of-silver" market fell due to large sales and lack of support.

<h3>Trend of Soft Interest Rates, Firm Call Loans</h3>
<p>Market Overview: With the end of the year not far off, the financial community is about to settle accounts, and the settlement of various business debts and transactions is being finalized at any time. Therefore, the current situation of interest rates and call loans does not seem to have any important records. However, the import and export of silver dollars are still busy. Shanghai is a current cash port, and the needs of other ports depend on Shanghai's supply. It is appropriate to overcome difficulties and request coordination.</p>
<p>Interest and Call Loan Prices (Silver Dollar Interest): The interest rate for early and midday markets was low because the supply side was crowded, so it was 7 mace, 2 fen, 3 li, 8 hao, 7 hu, and 5 si. As a result, it was 0.375 hao less than the early market of the previous day. (Silver Call Loan) The early and midday markets were also both 2 fen and 3 li, which was the same as the midday market of the previous day, but the situation was still firm, and there was little hope of relaxation. "Huatou" (brokers) added water at 8 or 9 fen. Bank posted rates were 9 fen.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market Conditions: Jiangnan small silver dollars were 6 mace, 4 fen, and 7.5 li in both the early and midday markets, which was half a li higher than the midday market of the previous day. Transactions were 4,000 "jiao" (10-cent pieces) in the early market and 2,000 "jiao" in the midday market. Guangdong small silver dollars were 6 mace, 4 fen, 9 li, and 7 hao and 5 si in the early market and 6 mace, 5 fen, and 0.2 hao and 5 si in the midday market. Transactions were 125,000 "jiao" in the early market and 35,000 "jiao" in the midday market. Copper coins increased by 500 "wen" (copper cash), to 379,000 "wen."</p>
<p>Silver Dollar Imports and Exports: (Silver) Yesterday's news of bank receipts and disbursements was slightly busier than the previous few days. Chinese merchants received and disbursed over 2.6 million in notes. Foreign merchants received and disbursed over 1.2 or 1.3 million in notes. Various merchandise, exchange taxes, and miscellaneous expenses received and disbursed over 8.2 or 8.3 million. Pawn transactions were 800,000 to 900,000. Special expenses received and disbursed over 2.9 million. One million was withdrawn from warehouses. Money shops and silver public offices received and disbursed over 53 million. "Huatou" funds received and disbursed over 4.8 million. Various remittances received and disbursed over 500,000. Cash receipts were 700,000 to 800,000. (Silver Dollars) Remittances made in the early market totaled 1.46 million and 1.061 million in the midday market. Cash tickets were 55,000 in the early market and 25,000 in the midday market. Outside the market, banknotes were 100,500 "jiao" in the early market and 65,000 "jiao" in the midday market. Interbank transactions were 500,000 in the early market and 450,000 in the midday market. Over 1.8 million was received and disbursed in the current accounts of various banks. Banknote inflows and outflows were over 2.1 million. Money shops and silver public offices received and disbursed over 8.2 million. "Huatou" funds received and disbursed over 3.2 million. Call loan inflows and outflows were over 1.3 million. Small money shop transactions were over 600,000, with over 400,000 in inflows and over 500,000 in outflows.</p>
<h3>News of Outflows Amidst the Prohibition of Cash Exports</h3>
<p>Since the opening of the sea has prohibited the export of cash, the silver and money industries and the customs brokers' association have successively submitted letters proving the purpose of the outflow and not for resale to the Japanese. However, it is difficult to avoid the situation of unscrupulous merchants secretly selling. Therefore, the relevant industries have formed a supervisory team to investigate, dissuade, and comply with the purpose of national salvation. It is found that a small number of financiers are still sending silver coins and silver dollars to Yantai, Yingkou, and other ports. From Monday of this week to yesterday, the amount has reached over 2 million, which has aroused the attention of all sectors. However, the associations have certified that they are adjusting the market. However, this type of business of exporting cash for profit should be temporarily suspended to avoid suspicion from the outside world. As for the banks, if they are indeed for legitimate use and must be shipped after proof, they are a minority.</p>
<h3>Securities and Bond Market Remain Extremely Sluggish</h3>
<p>Slight Fluctuations, Quiet Market Situation: Yesterday (the 10th), the situation in various bond markets of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was that spot transactions were not inactive, with 39,000 yuan traded in the morning and afternoon markets. The futures market was still depressed, with large investors making small transactions. The idle situation was the same as before. The two morning trading sessions totaled about 2 million yuan, and the later session only 1.1 million yuan, totaling 3.13 million yuan. As for the trend of various bonds, it became more sluggish, hovering between the various sessions without major changes. The domestic and international situation is depressing. The League of Nations is unable to deal with the Northeast issue and there is news that the conference is about to be abandoned. Therefore, the future situation between China and Japan is worthy of consideration, and both sides are still maintaining the status quo, with few new developments. Therefore, large investors in the market are watching, and there are few large transactions except for sporadic trading, resulting in an increasingly flat supply and demand situation, with very small fluctuations, and falling into a state of circling. The prices of various bonds were firmer in the early morning, then slightly weakened. As a result, except for the spot price of Disbandment Bonds rising by 1.7 yuan and the spot price of 20 Customs Bonds rising by 0.8 yuan, there were mutual increases and decreases, with only a few cents in total. Judging from the situation in the securities market, it seems that there will be no temporary rise or fall.</p>

<h3>Yarn, Raw Cotton and Cotton Cloth Are Weak</h3>
<p>The yarn market is flat and weak, and the situation is very weak. Because the country has many difficulties, and the brutal Japanese army's military affairs in the Northeast are becoming more serious, people's hearts are weak, and most retail investors are watching for declines. Moreover, silver is still difficult to loosen, so business is even more difficult to develop, and all sectors have no signs of excitement.</p>
<p>Extremely Few Bidders in the Auction: In the previous session of the auction, due to the heavy atmosphere of the situation, the market lacked buyers, and each fell by 2, 3, or 4 qian (cents). In the afternoon, it fell by nearly 3.6 qian, with long-term being flat. The total number of transactions for the day was 15,450 bales. It was found that Taixing sold 3,050 bales, Dachangcheng sold 1,100 bales, Mingde bought 500 bales, Changfeng bought 650 bales, and Gengfeng bought 450 bales. The closing prices are listed below.</p>

<p>January 1519 / 560,850 / April 1535 / 3 / 54,650</p>
<p>February 1529 / Up 1 / 71,400 / May 1535 / 5 / 29,450</p>
<p>Yarn Sales of 2,710 Bales: Spot yarn sales are average. It was found that the total statistics of each sector bought 2,700 bales, with 10 bales advanced by the same industry. The market is similar to the previous day. Among the out-of-town merchants, 120 bales advanced from the mainland, 25 bales advanced from Shantou, 400 bales advanced from Sichuan, 20 bales advanced from Guangdong, 85 bales advanced from Changsha, 30 bales advanced from Zhenjiang, and 5 bales advanced from Ningbo.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Is Mediocre and Uninspired</h3>
<p>The cotton market is stable, but although the silver price has shrunk sharply and the gold price has fallen, the foreign cotton situation is very weak and the situation is very tired. However, the sources in all directions are depressed, and because the end of the year is approaching and the silver supply is extremely tight, very few cotton merchants are going to the local area to purchase, so the amount of goods arriving is extremely small. Although each factory does not handle actual sales, the prices are still firm, and most long positions are tightly held.</p>
<p>Hankou Standard Slightly Weakened: In the previous session of the Hankou standard, due to the decline in foreign cotton and the fall in the gold price, the market lacked buyers, and each month fell by 1 or 2 qian. In the afternoon, each month rose slightly by 5 fen. The total number of transactions for the day was 43,900 "dan" (a unit of weight). It was found that Taixing sold 4,000 dan, Yichang sold 3,900 dan, and Changhe sold 1,100 dan. Gongtai bought 1,400 dan, Gengfeng bought 4,600 dan, Yongda bought 4,200 dan, and Yuchang bought 1,600 dan. The closing prices are listed below.</p>

<p>Tongyi Imported 200 Bales of Shaanxi Cotton: Spot cotton transactions are very few, and the source is 880 bales of Yao Cotton.</p>

<h3>Foreign Cotton Is Increasingly Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton weakened due to a weak Wall Street, poor demand, and reduced buyers. Futures fell by 6 to 10 points, and spot goods fell by 10 points. English cotton futures fell by 6 to 9 points, and spot goods fell by 4 points. Egyptian cotton spot goods remained unchanged. The Indian cotton market was weak, with Pingguol falling by 5 rupees, Yumu La falling by 3 rupees, and Bairo Creek falling by 3.75 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (9th telegram).</p>

<h3>Grain, River-Down Rice Market Sales Stagnant and Prices Weak</h3>
<p>Nantou: Yesterday, the source of each group was very light, arriving at about 20+ boats, but the Pu storage was still thick, and the city and rural shop sales felt particularly sluggish, due to the reduction in the gate market, and the quality of the goods was not good. The higher price of thick new japonica rice suddenly reduced by 2 jiao, but there were not many thin indica rice goods, and the sales venue in this street was deserted. The Ning storage was also repeatedly sluggish. The market price was short by 2 or 3 jiao. The Luoyang "jian" arrived and sales were light, and the market returned to a stable state. Goods coming from under the "bianyin" currency were still slack, and sporadic transactions were common, with no honor or disgrace in the market.</p>
<p>Xinzha: The sources of Suzhou, Changzhou, and Western New goods continued to be strong, and the retail shop storage was sparse due to the poor weather. There were few listings, transactions were light, and the market situation was clearly stable and secretly falling. Green stone thin indica rice arrivals were still surging, and also softened by 1 or 2 jiao. 3 to 4 boats of ocean "jian" arrived, and retail customers turned light, and the situation continued to soften. Ocean "jian" and guest "jian" also felt light and weak, resulting in a price drop of 1 jiao. Both "bianyin" 2 yuan arrivals and sales were average, and the selling price was set high and then reduced.</p>
<h3>Spot Ocean Rice and Hankou Market Continued to Sell</h3>
<p>Foreign Firms Continued to Dump Futures...Prices Stepped Down a Little</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market situation was that foreign firms continued to dump, and people's hearts were softer, and the market continued to fall. Yesterday, Chanson also sold 1,000 tons of small-grain rice for April at a price of 4 taels and 7 qian and 5 fen, and 1,200 tons for May at a price of 4 taels and 8 qian and 5 fen. The price was a little lower than the previous day, and it was still bought by this street. Spot goods were slightly more active yesterday, because the Hankou market inquired, but the market still fell, with 1,500 bags of small-grain rice opened at a price of 9 yuan and 9 jiao to 9 yuan and 7 jiao and 5 fen. The Hankou market bought over 500 bags, and the rest was bought by this street.</p>
<h3>The Flour Market Continued to Be Tired After the Factory Stopped Dumping</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market generally showed signs of fatigue, because the prices of foreign wheat fell by 4, 5, 6, and 7 jiao, and the hearts of people inside and outside the industry were not good. However, because the factory stopped dumping, although there were some hedge trades, this was little meaning. However, in general, the state affairs became increasingly serious, and the silver supply was still not loose. If there is no way out for the goods, the outcome of this month is very difficult to be optimistic. As a result, this month was small 5 li less than the previous day, January was unchanged, February was small 2.5 li less, March was 2.5 li, April was 2.5 li less, and May was 7.5 li less.</p>
