<h3 id="c47">霪雨之禍 <a href="#c47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>最近積久霪雨。連朝不開。偶一小霽。即又陰雲四合。大雨直下。各大都市如南京上海等處。都積水成渠。馬路上一片汪洋。而大江黄河連河淮河兩岸。及全國低窪濱湖各地。更都洪水肆虐。概淪澤國。如湖南之常德湘潭溆浦臨灃沅江沅陵華容岳陽等縣。安徽之安慶合肥蕪湖蚌埠霍。邱鳳台阜陽穎上蒙城宿縣壽縣懷遠盱眙定遠鳳陽明光等縣。江蘇之高郵淸江浦揚洲瓜州無錫等地。河南之信陽鹿邑孟縣濟源登封襄城臨潁等縣。廣東之廣州以及東江西江北江沿流各地。幾於全國東西尚北。概洪流浩蕩。白浪翻江。波激所至。屋宇田禾。全歸烏有。秋收旣顆粒無望。孑遺亦亦棲息無所。而洪水騍臨。人民之慘遭淹没者。更無從算計。大地南北。哀鴻徧野。此時之災况固可慘。未來之荒象更可懼。此實亘古未有之巨災。亦卽我政府我國人在目前亟應加以注意。并預籌補救之一嚴重問題也。我國近數十年來。天災人禍。幾於無歲無有。風雹水旱。蟲疫以至兵匪。一災未已。一災又至。如昨年綏遠察哈爾寗夏靑海陜甘河南之旱災。湖南湖北江西福建之匪災。前年隴海津浦平漢沿綫各地之兵災。迄今猶野盈餓莩。道載離。荒凉滿目。赤地千里。據十九年振務委員會統計。全國被災之縣。共約八百三十一。佔全國縣分總額五分之二而强。其中尚有湖北寗夏靑海未列入災民總數共約四千七百八十四萬六千七百。佔全國人口總額十分之一而强。其中尚有一百三十七縣災民未列入。合綜推算。全國災民。當在六千萬人左右。此鉅大之數目字。已足使吾人驚心動魄。若更加入目前洪水漂蕩下之災區與災民。數目字之增大。當更令人昨舌。哀此編氓。生究何辜。死者暴露。生者轉徙。甚且轉徙無法。坐困待斃。木根樹葉。敗絮黄士。概羅掘。以求一果枵腹。人類傷心慘目之事。顧尚有甚於此者耶。往昔人類文明程度低落。致災之因。不知預防。災禍之來。又不知抗禦。輒歸諸天命。謂爲天災。徒感嘆於昊天之不弔。仰望蒼穹以待死。死知之所不及。力之所未逮。吾人固不可遠責古人。然自近世以來。人類文明。日臻發達。凡茲災禍之恨因。及其預防之方法。都已爲文明國家所共知。并積極致力。以科學之方法。補救預防自然界之災患。除地震海嘯尚未有法外。餘大都爲人力所能及。天地不仁以萬物爲芻狗之語。在二十世紀之今日。殆已不值一笑。故今日地球上尚有災禍發生。則實非天降。責盡在人。在罹災之人民。固爲横死。在災禍發生之國家。更爲奇恥大辱。歐美各國。對此極爲重視。政府人民。共同努力於消弭禍患之根因。容或災禍偶發。亦共同努力補救。决不坐視災禍之發。一次二次永至於無數十次而迄不注意。獨有我國。殆如不處於今日文明發達之天地。人民猶時受自然之迫害與襲擊。旱也。水也。疫也。更加以有意造成之兵禍匪刦。此災未已。彼災又來。十數年來。綿延不絶。舉國上下。坐待慘刦。絶不予以預防。此眞我國家獨有之現象也。即如此次泛濫横溢之大江黄河。如我防之有法。導之有方。皆國家之大利也。惟其無方。故利乃爲害。本可以福人者。乃以殺人。我政府固亦有導河淮委員會之設立。而導之結果。終至於人畜漂流。田廬蕩盡。此眞足令吾人顰首長嘆者矣。往者已矣。來者可追。吾人於今日。他亦無言。惟以至誠企望兩點。（一）今後我政府對於防災禦災之科學方法。應切實講求。并普教國民。使能共起努力。（二）對於此次水災。應及早籌謀補救。豫使災區不擴大。災黎得有歸宿。尤有進者。連歲各地浩刦。數百萬同胞。全淪於求死不得求生不能之人間地獄。凡有心肝。當無不慘傷。我幸未被災者。極應一致節食省衣。預謀救濟。集欵振救。此即其時。若視他人肥瘠。漠無喜戚。則記者無言。惟有爲人類之同情心而一哭。爲我國家之體面而一哭。更預爲茲後無數候補横死之同胞而長聲一哭耳。</p>

<p>「大小兩界。原有天限。土門江（卽圖們江）」分隷吉林與咸鏡平安地。三百年疆宇寗謐。敝邦愚氓。冒禁逾犯。私自墾種。幸蒙字小。不予懲責。俾令内附。惟習俗旣殊。風土不並。該民旣係本邦生長。茲因佔種一事。便隷版圖。萬一滋事。深爲可慮。乞許令吉林琿春敦化地方所有朝鮮流民。刷還本國。交付地方官弁歸籍辦理。吉林官地已經朝鮮民墾種者。由吉林地方經理收租。仍嚴明申禁。永杜後弊。庶</p>
<p>敝邦邊民不更越界矣」。</p>
<p>觀此。則可知斯時韓民之越墾。純爲迫於飢僅。皆自知爲冐禁。絶無覬覦我土地之心。而且斯時韓民之越墾。亦不過限於茂山對岸之外六道溝等處。茂山以下圖們江北之地。則無有也。至光緒十六年。由總理衙門奏請將越墾之地。編甲。升科。領照。納租。歸地方官管轄。光緒二十年。吉林將軍奏設撫墾局。照總理衙門所奏辦理。於是韓民之越悉者。皆編甲升墾科。食毛踐土。入我版籍。而得有土地主權矣。茲節錄總理衙門奏稿如次。</p>
<p>「朝鮮流民佔墾吉林邊。光緒七年。經前任將軍銘安。督辦邊防事宜吳大徵奏准。將該流民查明戸籍。分歸琿春敦化縣管轄。嗣因朝鮮國王墾請刷還流民。咨由禮部轉奏。請將軍等覆。准予限一年。由該國地方官設法收回。復因限期以滿。該國仍不將流民刷還。反縱其過江侵佔。經前任將軍希元咨由總理衙門奏准。派員會勘。（中略）乃該國王不加詳考。遽信勘界使李重夏偏執之詞、堅請以紅山水立界。齟齬難合。然未便以勘界之故。遂置越墾爲緩圖。現在朝鮮茂山府對岸迤東之光霽峪六道溝十八歲子等地方、韓民越墾。約有數千。地約數萬垧。此處旣有圖們江天然界限。自可無庸再勘。該國遷延至今。斷難將流民刷還。應即祗遵前奉諭旨。飭令領照納租。歸我版籍。先行派員淸丈。編甲升科。以期邊民相安等語。臣等查吉林朝鮮界務。前經兩次會勘。所未能即定者。特茂山以上直接三泡汲二百餘里之圖們江源處耳。至茂山以下。圖們江巨流。乃天然界限。江南岸爲該國咸鏡道屬之茂山會寗鐘城穩城慶源慶興六府。江北岸爲吉林之琿春敦化縣地方。該國勘界使。亦無異說。韓民越墾多年。廬墓相望。一旦盡令刷還。數千人失業無依。不特情實可憐。急切亦無辦法。若聽其以異籍之民。日久佔住。主客不分。殊非久計。但近年該處墾民。疊以韓民越墾徵租。種種苛擾。赴吉林控訴。經北洋大臣李鴻章咨臣衙門有案。誠如原奏所云。韓員剥削民生之苦。流民服我賦稅之輕。是其心悅誠服。安土重遷。已可概見。現在江源界址。旣難尅日劃淸。則無須勘定處所。似宜及時撫綏。以慰流氓歸附之心。擬請飭下該將軍遴派賢員。將淸丈升科（中略）領照納租。歸地方官管轄。一切詳細章程。由該將軍體查情形。奏明辦理。</p>
<p>由上奏稿觀之。則可知今日之延邊問題。實種因於是時。而其時（光緒十六年）朝鮮茂山府對岸迤東之光霽峪六道溝十八歲子等韓民。計達數千。墾地至數萬晌之多。爲歷史上極堪注意之事實。</p>
<p>国惟是斯時韓民越墾者。猶不過今日和龍峪經歷所轄之地。招墾之地。（卽延廳所轄之地）則絶無之。迨後韓民越墾者日衆。招墾華民之承領荒地者。多招韓人爲傭佃。且有將荒地售與韓民者。於是爲時不久。而我海蘭河布爾哈通河嘎呀河流域。以至遍延吉境内。多有韓民足跡。其後韓人以艷我土地肥沃。穀産豐盈。遂進而生侵佔之計。光緒二十八九年有私造圖們江橋梁之舉。有派員渡江巡視之舉。有韓官越界歛財之舉。有爭圖們江中假江爲間島之舉（間島之名始見於此）有李範允帶兵過江刦掠華民傷害華民之舉。卒以極力禁止韓民亂黨。獲以相安無事者數年。於是日人因而覬覦。欲利用越墾好民自利之私心。以隂行其侵略我領土之手段。至光緒三十三年。而界務問題乃起。（未完）</p>

<p>昨晚持志大學籃球隊以三十二比二十分大勝日本商大籃球隊於中華籃球隊、觀者數日來最盛、蓋慕持志球藝之深造、此爲商大第五次之敗績、</p>
<p>▲頑强抗拒　上塲商大抗拒甚力、孔廣益開紀錄後、分數每僅一二分之差五比五、而八比八二次平手、商大憑其迅速傳攻、常有進襲、持志振臂一呼、全軍猛進、頓成十五比九之大優勝、以十五比十一勝上半時、</p>
<p>▲軍行順利　下半時、持志漸戰漸順手、軍行無阻、一下得八分、造二十比十二之比數、商大見來勢甚凶、守禦謹嚴、兵將時調、持志分數總以七八分超出、至二十五比十七時、揚中將忽以四次犯規出、軍容並不因此稍動、錢孔二鋒、互相策應、以二十八比十八大勝、歡聲大振、卒以三十二比二十分勝、</p>
<p>▲尚未痛快　以持志之球藝、理應痛擊商犬、昨日勝分、尚不能饜吾人之望、其故在多日未上手、以致失去可中之球甚多、但楊錢二鋒之矯健、孔鋒之英勇鎭靜、威風仍不减也、商大以永井金子二人可觀、</p>
<p>▲滬中出戰　今日稱雄海上之滬江附中出戰商大、當可得勝、八時仍在籃球房、次爲商大來滬之末一戰、</p>

<p>馮先生开。字君木。原名鴻墀。字階靑。慈谿人。慈谿名族馮爲舊。自有史以來。用文學顯者。代有其人。而先生之成尤多。先生爲學。務其大不遺其細。博聞强識如王深寗。其文章。高邁峻潔。内　而外肆。則如汪容父。蓋並先生世。一時無有當者。詩。初宗杜韓。所詣近玉溪。中年稍稍取法西江。晚更離亂。聲華益刋落。每有謠詠。和千灌百辟。融冶情性而出之。嘗曰。作詩當於無味處得味。無材處見材。顧今世疇知之哉。生平重氣誼。尚節槩。少日嘗與同縣陳鏡堂·鄭光祖·馮毓孶·應啓墀·錢保杭·魏友枋·姚壽祁·諸人結惇社。制社約。善相勸而過相規。學問道義相勉益。羣議一人主其事。或以屬先生。先生謂鏡堂。其人淸亮高曠而多文。誠非吾儕幾。宜爲長。會有訐惇社好標榜。睡幾復繆轍。先生於是乃請改名剡社。爲詩酒之會。曰剡者。鏡堂所居地剡山也。先生品藻羣流。少所臧可。獨於高己者服膺拳拳如此。人以是益賢之。先生旣少雋早成。有聲邦邑。四方問學之士。趾錯於庭。殷勤納交。或委贄焉。先生則開陳肺腑。以待來者。心有所勿知。知之未嘗不爲言。耳有所勿聞。聞之未嘗不爲告。生性善感。畜志棣羣。人無戚疏。情無厚薄。一與之合。終身以之。至其行事。介不絶俗。通不疑今。則又與𡝫𡝫自得者殊其量矣。内修之美。旣越羣倫。繹古之功。尤多創發。晚年講學滬上。益與先朝名宿老師相往還。安吉吳倉碩·臨桂况周頤·吳興朱孝臧·尤契先生。吳況前數年歾。有遺言必先生銘其墓。旣具草而病作。凡病三閱月而遂絶。年五十有九。嗚呼。天喪斯文。國無人矣。傷哉傷哉。先生父曰某。習儒不售。去隱於市。擅繪事。書法疏秀多致。母氏兪。邑儒某之女。知書明禮。教子有方。先生生若干年而孤。依母受詩。以長以立。以至於成。年二十八。由拔貢官麗水縣訓導。著有回風堂詩文集若干卷。詞一卷。日記若干卷。雜著若干種。取兪氏。名因。著婦學齋詞一卷。繼取陳氏李氏。子。男二。貞胥。兪出。貞用。李出。女一。貞兪。李出。孫。男一。昭遂。女一。昭多。貞胥子。</p>

<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>沿恒河岸有許多男女住之。女修士少。自然男人爲多。貧富均有。而貧者多。有古石堆。完好如廟。而崩頺於岸上。云昔時大水冲倒也。今後立新廟多所。有一大花水池。水甚潔。當是大施洗所。想見自恒河以至約但河。此萬里宗教區相差不遠。古先哲人皆以水洗心而得救者也。有修士者。裸體向日。身止繫一繩。於大股際。有修士者。髮垂尺許。有修士者。全身以灰塗之。靜坐不語。總之若以精神爲教。則印度文化爲世界祖師。若以物質爲教。則美國爲今世大王。若以推翻物質爲教。則俄國爲世界之王。但若以大中重正公平文明爲教。或者全球有賴於我中華乎。吾觀於印度高士之苦修。而令我神往於先哲自度度世之術也。</p>
<p>學童告余曰。波羅奈爲全印度聖地。現在有許多大學教授博士等。尚願死於波羅奈之恒河邊。余驚問其故。莫非自殺投河乎。曰非也。因全印人久信波羅奈聖地接近於神。凡人至此死。則焚其尸爲灰。投於恒河而得生天也。余聞童言。感慨係之。童方人肉身不久住於世。乃塵土耳。故我國名人以生天爲解脫也。余甚驚此童乃向我說法。乃信佛經屢載文殊師利教他童子事。印度童子之人生哲學。有如此犀利也。</p>
<p>近日印人又與英警吏衝突事。印人自殺。蓋印人與英人衝突。不殺英人而自殺。爲屢見之事。余以問印人。印人曰。甘地教我等不要抵抗英人。故自殺耳。寗願自殺。不顧殺英人。以累及家室親友也。按印人本以自殺爲非。在宗教上頗否認之。今甘地不教與英人抗。故憤而自戕者多。其結怨於印人者甚矣。將來必有一日暴發也。</p>
<p>至抵制英貨事。印人云一年可節省六萬萬元。故全國一致。决不若吾國抵制外貨只五分鐘熱度也。滿街皆戴吾國式之粗布孝帽。卽富貴之家。亦用粗布爲桌圍。蓋甘地之教。甚似老子之復古派。甘其食。美其服。樂其居。老死不相往來。以極端之精神與物質抗。而物質派有失敗之勢。然則精神亦可畏哉。一教授告我。彼觀俄國統計。自俄政府建設後。人民受教育者已有百分之二十幾分。比於舊俄國上百分之三分而已。至今印度平均教育不過三分至六分。要之印人有傾向甘地者。新派亦有傾向俄國者。亦有傾向中國者。其前進則一也。將來誠有希望。蓋中俄之大革命。皆與印人以大剌激也。</p>

<p>— 徐卓呆</p>
<p>子良立刻用兩個指頭，把它捉住，也不敢親手處它死刑，怕弄得手上有臭味，他就把它對洋燭頂上融解着的油裏一放，居然身體粘牢，把它烤起來了。</p>
<p>「你今天初次練習，也不要多，限你捉三個！」</p>
<p>夫人見他非常容易，自然要限他一個數；那知第一個雖凑巧，第二個，竟大大的不容易，找了好久，簡直没有，後來在被單縫裏，才找到一個童子臭虫，身體還是全紅的咧，他照樣放在洋燭上面，第二個已經大大費事，第三個當然更難了，幸虧子良心靈，在褥子下面，尋到一個臭蟲的殼，他也把它冒充臭蟲，放到蠟燭上去。</p>
<p>夫人見三個已經完備，便來一個下塲勢：</p>
<p>「好了！臭蟲都捉去了，我們可以睡了！」</p>
<p>子良偷看手錶時，見還没有到九點鐘，很好的光隂，不去改作文，老早的睡覺，未免可惜：</p>
<p>「你先睡，我還有事情，要去做咧。」</p>
<p>子良一說，夫人又來了：</p>
<p>「你這人本不識抬舉！我照應你，只呌你捉三個臭蟲，你捉完了，反而不來陪我，要到後面去了。也好！那末你替我捉三十個來！好人是做不得的！」</p>

<p>棉市趨勢略見錯雜、因外棉平平、而本埠天氣惡劣、時雨時晴、新棉發育恐受影響、有數處報告已遭水害、所以内地帮心思均傾向買進、惟火機帮稍有套出、現棉生意仍滯云、</p>

<p>▲新閘　昨日西路到頭略少、早間大雨不止、斛胃毫無、至午後天時轉晴、各店號臨市者尚稱踴躍、近來雨勢太多、人心惶惶、河下存底日薄、後到略稀、價格逐步提增、常蘇厚粳及早晚稻來貨寥寥、價比前二日抬高三四角至五六角不等、崑山米與蘆洋尖均昂二三角、趨勢轉緊、糯米上落角許、河廠各貨斛開五六千擔、</p>
<p>▲南市　各帮來源因雨阻寥寥、河存亦薄、城鄉店銷乃緣天雨、内地出貨不易、人心更健、店方進意活絡、成交尤夥、厚粳行情又提二三角、薄稻到積均乏、而問津尚殷、市形約增二角、迨至十時、計祗二艘、但未售開、薄厚粳到頭日稀、聞各處連日雨水過多、低窪之區、恐成水患、杜洋尖貨仍零星、走銷尚可、價格跟起、到銷二敵、形呈堅象、</p>

<p>▲内地帮不限價爭購</p>
<p>昨日粉市呈堅俏之象、雖洋麥報價小去一二角、惟自前日至昨晨、陣雨滂沱、無異傾盆、江南北各處災象頻告、食糧市價、步見飛騰、因此内地帮及長江一帶、不限市値盡力爭購、（半日成交達一百十餘萬）幸一部份廠家又有定成、遂向遠期套出、市氣漸平、否則漲度當更可觀、觀後步以天雨關係、恐人心尚難轉平也、結果本月份較週三漲一分半、八月份漲一分、九·十·十一月份好七厘半、十二月份好二厘半云、</p>

<p>昨日期麥市面均呈嚴重之象、内地人心、均以大雨未停、田禾已受影響、預測糧價恐須飛漲、故買氣異常猛烈、步步爭進、聞南京·南通兩處内地廠亦吸收甚湧、統市達二三百車之間、惟本埠行家因前昨兩日、洋麥又成交澳麥四船、數達二萬餘噸、故亦趁此機會、層層套出、（全日總成交計一千餘萬）約有五百車之巨、然人心方漲、雖不因此而挫軟、但無此批套賣、則投機者之抬價、又不知伊于何底也、八月份因係近期、賣方不套、漲度最甚、餘則祗三五分、結果本月份較週三漲三分、八月份漲七分、九月份漲五分、十月份漲三分、十一月份漲二分、十二月份漲三分、現麥交易、回標準高昂、喊價亦帶起三五分、開奔牛·丹陽·揚州·浦東·崑山·周浦·嘉定·黄渡·雙鳳等麥、由福新辦一千四百包、華豐辦二千五百包云、</p>

<h3 id="c211">火鷄皇后 <a href="#c211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— 朱玉相</p>
<p>美國婦女商業人才</p>
<p>名震遐邇</p>
<p>在美國依達華州内、目下有一位婦女、全州的人、不論男女老幼、都熟聞她的名字、並且尊穩她爲火鷄皇后哩、</p>
<p>距今六年以前、她還是像其他許多農工的妻子一般、每在工餘、辛勤地飼養幾隻火鷄、賣得了錢、藉以增加些微家庭收入、幫着丈夫維持生計、但是至了現在、由於她的商業天才和努力奮鬥、她已一躍而爲一個商業組合的領袖人物了、隸屬於那個組合底下的會員、總共有一千八百人、而每年成交貿易的總額、則在美金七十五萬元以上、除此之外、最值得令人讚美的一點、就是在她領導之下、美國農家婦女中、竟有一千四百人能夠獲得經濟上的實惠、</p>
<p>是在一九二四年的春季、美國依達華州内包哀西地方、有一位勃林克夫人、最先提議設立一個火鷄市塲、在那裏、這簡直是一件創舉、以前是從來没有過的、提議的動機、是因爲那年她所飼養的一小羣火鷄、在發育長大以後、正値待價出售的時候了、然而、竟没有一個買客臨站旭、同時、還有旁的幾百個農婦、也都感到同樣的困難、於是她便想到、爲什麽不組織一個公共團體、合夥銷售本地的火鷄呢、這樣、可以把大宗火鷄、和東方南塲訂立合同、善價售賣了、</p>
<p>消耗了許多的時間和毅力、勃林克夫人的計劃終於實現了、當這個火鷄營業組合開始成立的時候、祗有十四位基本會員、開辦以後第一年、販售給東方市塲的火鷄、祗裝了三輛運貨車、而所得的價錢、却是打破了依達華火鷄市價歷來的紀錄、一般飼養火鷄的人家、都得了意外的豐收、</p>
<p>在第二年、這火鷄營業組合所販售出境的火鷄、比上年增加了好幾倍、裝着十二輛運貨車、第三年、又增加至二十七輛、第四年、竟裝出四十六輛之多了、據最近調查所得、一九三○丨一九三一之間、該組合販運出境的火鷄、整整裝了六十五輛運貨車、全年貿易總額、竟超過美金七十五萬元、而且、去年美國全國的火鷄市價、都是依照依達華火鷄組合所規定的、其操縱市塲的勢力、於此也足見一斑了、</p>
<p>勃林克夫人所創設的火鷄組合、現在非常發達、隷屬其下的飼養火鷄人家、非但限於依達華一州、並且遍及奥里剛州的東部、和　依達華州的南部諸地了、大部份會員、差不多有百分之九十、都是農家婦女、在勃林克夫人領導之下、這一般婦女、對於飼養火鷄、都知道加以相當的注意、她們熟習一種特殊方法、能夠選擇出優種的火鷄、並且能以最低的消費、使鷄羣繁殖起來、目下單是勃林克夫人家内、每年出售的火鷄、已經超過一千五百隻了、</p>

<p>（七）生活寫眞</p>
<p>輕淡的飲料可以從下面藥店裏購買、呌他送上樓來、曼米和柏德飲了好幾次、在這裏跳舞的靑年人不飲致醉的酒漿、這大概他們太窮不能買那種昂價的酒、其中有許多人、也很整潔的、</p>
<p>到了午夜音樂停止了、這樣使得靑年人異常悲哀、他們要求、再舞一次、有時候音樂隊都答應他們、</p>
<p>回家的時候、曼米感覺到非常疲倦、她白天在店裏站了一日、晚上又跳舞幾個鐘頭、現在伊渴欲睡眠、伊實在太疲乏與柏德講話、他用簡單的音調對伊話道、「漂亮的音樂、」「你是個佳妙的舞伴、」</p>
<p>他們倆同到曼米的家門、家裏人都熟睡了、所以他們必須很安靜、柏德當然不能進屋去、因爲合組屋的各房間、除了廚房之外、都做了臥室、他們倆在門外耳語了片刻、曼米說夜安、便用鑰匙放進銷孔去、</p>
<p>「曼米」柏德執住了伊的玉臂、「吻我罷、我對你發狂了、」</p>
<p>「柏德、不要、放棄了罷、你决不能這樣子、」曼米奮鬬着、與她的心思交戰、</p>
<p>「祗要一吻便罷了、」他懇求、伊便掉轉頭來、用吻在他的頰上印了一下、然後她跑進屋子去、</p>
<p>曼米必須在黑暗中脫去衣服、因爲伊的妹妹們睡得非常之熟、曼米仍舊感到伊的嘴唇在柏德的面頰上、伊已經吻過他了、雖然伊十分疲乏、可是還不能一睡即着、她開始奇怪起來、不知道她要碰見些什麽、伊要去和柏德那樣的人結婚麽、一間小小的合組屋、終日在家中操作、還有孩子丨這多是伊的名份、丨好像伊母親所遇到的一般、但是對於柏德有時候總覺得很甜密、而且有時候覺得十分的美滿、使伊有熱烈的懷想、或者伊還是在店裏繼續工作、丨或許幾年之後、能夠獲得一個重要的位置哩、第二天早晨她要早起身、胡思亂想、未免要失眠的、她便將頭朝軟的枕上一擱、一霎時間、她便離去了這個現實世界</p>

<p>— 曼生</p>
<p>是個初夏的淸晨、</p>
<p>橙黄色的微曦、在樹叢中閃爍着、枝上的小鳥、喞喳地在噪、</p>
<p>他挾着一包日本點心盒、從電車上跳下、興奮地走到南路斯里第卅九號的門前、這是、他内心裏忽的起了一陣微弱的顫動、他站住了、這樣地躊躇了一會、畢竟、他還是昂起頭、挺着胸、大步的走了進去、</p>
<p>一個難堪的景象、顯露到他的眼前、使他永遠地不會忘記、直到他靈魂散失了的時候、</p>
<p>亭子間的門開着、裏面甚麽都没有了、除了一張笨重的鐵床、他怔住了、</p>
<p>在門上、一張紙條兒在隨着微風搖曳着、他走攏去看乃是留給乙君的、大概是說她也遷移的吧、……他眼裏突然地糢糊起來、紙上的每一個字、都好似在跳、「反正是搬啦、看又有什麽作、」他這樣地想、同時、視線也就轉移了他的方向、</p>
<p>他悵然地朝四下裏看着、腦海裏也開始在不停的盤旋了、啊、這兒不是擺着一個書架、那兒不是放着張書桌、在書桌上不是站着一張她的照片嗎、啊、床、這張床、在四天前不是展露着一倦少女的睡容嗎、快樂的回憶、頓時侵入了他的腦裏、他在幻想着、</p>
<p>四天前的一個淸早、他筆挺地站在那亭子間的門前、使勁把他那微顫的右手提起、在門上輕輕地彈了一下</p>
<p>「誰呀、」</p>
<p>「我、没有起來嗎、……没有甚麽事、」</p>
<p>……」他在吞吞吐吐的說、</p>
<p>「等我來開呀」裏面嚮了、她在開門、</p>
<p>「等一會兒再進來、」</p>
<p>「吾、」</p>
<p>她趕緊又鑽進被窩、</p>
<p>他終於進去了、</p>
<p>「Ｇodd　Morning、」他答訕的說、</p>
<p>「………………」她微笑、</p>
<p>惺忪的睡眼、活潑地啟閉着、波浪般地頭髮、散披在枕上、……一切少女的美媚、都映入他的眼中、腦中、直達他心之深處。</p>
<p>「坐呀、」黄鶯般地音調、把他從迷夢中喊轉來、</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>「是……别客氣、」他無所適從地答着、</p>
<p>他坐下來了、沉默佔有了一切、他極力在掙扎着要把他要向她說的話盡量的說出、但、終於被他好顫抖的嘴辱阻止了、</p>
<p>他開始打破了這房間裏的沉寂、</p>
<p>「昨天晚上同史君去看電影、因爲太遲、來不及回校、就在他那兒睡了、今天偶然地順便走來……」他好似要表白他來的動意、不停的在說着、</p>
<p>「那一家、」</p>
<p>「Ａpollo、片子不大好、」</p>
<p>又沉默了一會兒、</p>
<p>「星期日去看電影、你在這兒等我、他在祈求、」</p>
<p>「好的、」</p>
<p>談話就這樣地開始了、</p>
<p>這樣地談了一會兒、</p>
<p>「你出去一刻、讓我起來、」她笑著向他說、</p>
<p>「好、」自然地、他含笑地走出、</p>
<p>他在梳洗了、</p>
<p>他老是望著她或她的照片出神、忽的他在、袋裏掏出一管Ｐarker和一本小簿子、沙沙地在寫、</p>
<p>熱血似燃燒般地翻滾、</p>
<p>生命似浮萍般地飄零、</p>
<p>顯示出幾許身世的酸辛、</p>
<p>宇宙是這樣地晦黯、</p>
<p>人間是這樣地不平、</p>
<p>衝突呵、奮鬥、</p>
<p>纔是我們應走的路程、</p>
<p>趁著你靑春尚存、</p>
<p>趁著你熱血未凝、</p>
<p>這最後的掙扎呀、</p>
<p>緊緊著你整個的人生、</p>
<p>「那裏、不通得很、」</p>
<p>他終於遞給她了、</p>
<p>「很好、」</p>
<p>「那裏、」</p>
<p>舊事和電影一般、一幕幕的從他腦裏閃過、他再不能支持了、他埀着頭、悵惘地走下樓梯、</p>
<p>房東的女人、正在洗著衣服、</p>
<p>「克小姐那裏去啦、」</p>
<p>「回去了、她不是西省的人嗎、」</p>
<p>「甚麽時候、」</p>
<p>「昨天四點鐘、」</p>
<p>「唔、」</p>
<p>遲鈍的步武、載著那次重的身軀慢慢地蹁出了這屋子、他很微弱地嘆了一口氣、</p>
<p>太陽已穿過了樹林晒到屋頂上了、鳥也停止了她們的歌唱、人們都在怱怱地忙著他們的工作、他依舊是低著頭、兩手揷在外衣袋裏、頽然地在Ａ路上無目的的來回蹁著、嘴裏似乎在很低微的哼著、「Ｗhen　I　awake　to　foound　you　goneＲamona,I　need　you　my　ownl」</p>

<p>— 李作猷</p>
<p>ＭＲ·陳、今天放假了、Ｅxcuse一課罷、多言的開一見陳先生上課就這樣說、本來今天向例是放假的、但不知什麽　故、佈告箱中并未見有關於放假的告示、學生們没有膽量呌主任放假、所以祇好退一步向馬虎的教員進攻了、</p>
<p>「不、不、」陳先生搖着頭說、</p>
<p>「啊、馬馬虎虎罷、横竪我們心不在這裏的、」開又要求着說、</p>
<p>「Ｅxcuse一課有什麽意思、不如我們說個趣話罷、」</p>
<p>「好、好」說完要Ｅxcuse的」開說、</p>
<p>「淸明時節雨紛紛……誰能續全首、」陳先生滿面春風的說着、</p>
<p>「陳先生、我續一句、」壞說、但是陳先生祇是搖着頭、擺着手、不做聲、</p>
<p>「我續兩句、好不好、」禮以爲陳先生不答話是好的、所以像逼先生答話的說着、</p>
<p>但陳先生仍然不做聲、因爲他的目的是在乎全首、一兩句是没有多大意義的、</p>
<p>後來克　手了、但是陳先生没有注意到他、所以没有和他招呼、他祇好放下手了、</p>
<p>「誰能冩全首、」</p>
<p>「喂、快舉手、先生呌人出去寫呢、」禮向克說、但克不舉手、他急了、他直接指着克向先生、「他懂、他懂、」他又向克說、「喂、快寫呀、寫完了要Ｅxcuse的、」</p>
<p>克在黑板寫了、大概是爲着Ｅxcuse那個字的魔力底緣故罷、</p>
<p>陳先生看黑板讀着一首詩、詩的字是這樣的、</p>

<h3 id="e1">Eradication of the Opium Scourge <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Opium, morphine, heroin, and other such poisons are detested and loathed by all knowledgeable people. Even compatriots who have already fallen into the clutches of addiction are happy to try to quit. Unfortunately, although there are many different types of drug cessation products on the market, very few of them are truly effective. If one mistakenly takes medicine that only temporarily suppresses the craving, not only will it fail to cure the addiction, but it will also harm one's health and increase the amount of drugs needed, causing no small amount of harm.</p>
<p>Feng's Addiction-Breaking and Suffering-Relieving Golden Elixir has the function of fundamentally eradicating drug toxins. Those who have repeatedly sought medical treatment and taken medicine without success in quitting will all experience miraculous results after taking it. When quitting, continue to smoke as usual, and you will gradually become disgusted with smoking day by day. Mild addiction (one or two portions) will be cured in ten days. Severe addiction (four or five portions) will be eradicated in half a month. Its efficacy is so rapid, and the comfort of body and mind during the quitting process has been proven by millions of people.</p>
<p>Each portion costs only one and a half yuan for the medicine itself. Mail orders require a minimum of two portions, plus one ▲ for postage. The addiction-quitting method is enclosed with the mailing. Address: Junzhi Tang, intersection of Baker Road and Datong Road, Shanghai ▲ Local sales are available at Sincere, Wing On, and various pharmacies.</p>

<h3 id="e2">Order to Arrest Shi Yousan <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government issued an order on the 24th stating that Shi Yousan was rebellious, fond of creating chaos, and habitually fickle. The central government had always been generous and tolerant, repeatedly giving him opportunities. However, according to recent reliable reports, this traitor took advantage of the nationwide suppression of the Red Army to support the communist bandits, wage war against the nation, and sow discord. Given his past record of incorrigible wickedness, he cannot be tolerated by the national law. Shi Yousan should be immediately stripped of all his posts and concurrent positions. Military and civilian officials at all levels in all provinces and cities are ordered to arrest him. The troops under his command belong to the nation. Those who deeply understand righteousness and return to the fold will be treated the same by the central government and entrusted with important responsibilities. Those who willingly join the rebellion and remain obstinate should be severely suppressed to maintain order and discipline. This order (Telegraph from the 24th).</p>

<p>Lists Shi Yousan's Crimes</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Zhang Xueliang's public announcement denouncing Shi Yousan has been published. There is also a telegram to the Northeast soldiers, which lists Shi's crimes: betrayal of the party and the country is disloyalty; indulgence of bandits and harming the people is inhumanity; rebellion against superiors and creating chaos is injustice; breaking oaths and going back on his word is untrustworthiness. Any one of these is an unpardonable crime, let alone all four. All front-line generals should bravely take the lead and kill the enemy to achieve results. Rear-line generals should diligently train and await orders to eradicate traitors for the country without hesitation. Meritorious deeds will be rewarded accordingly, as national law dictates.

<h3 id="e4">Tense Military Situation Regarding the Suppression of Shi <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>The Vanguard of the Central Army Passes Cizhou and Advances North</p>
<p>The Northeast Air Force Inspects Along the Pinghan Railway</p>
<p>Shi Telegrams Han and Ma to Surrender</p>
<p>Chiang and Zhang Do Not Accept</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to the Railway Bureau, the four train services between Beiping and Baoding have officially resumed, with trains running in both directions daily, and travel is very safe. Shi Yousan willingly undermines peace, and the possibility of war on the Pinghan and Jinpu lines is imminent. Wang Shuchang returned to Tianjin last night and immediately went to Machang to direct military operations. The front line of the Northeast Army on the Pinghan line is in the area of Wangdu and Xinle. The two brigades of Dong Yingbin and Li Zhentang have already advanced to Wangdu. The Second Squadron of the Northeast Air Force is concentrated south of Baoding and will bomb Shijiazhuang. Shi's troops dare not come out during the day. The First Battalion of the Northeast Signal Corps, with 1,500 men, led by Wang Guozhi, arrived in Beiping this morning and immediately transferred to the Pinghan line.</p>
<p>(Special telegraph from the 24th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Seventeen Northeast aircraft scouted along the Pinghan line this morning. When they flew to an area twenty li north of Jinxian County, they saw Shi Yousan's troops crossing the river in three small boats. In addition to dropping bombs from the lowest altitude, the aircraft also fired machine guns, killing more than two or three thousand of Shi's troops. (Special telegraph from the 24th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chiang Kai-shek telegraphed Yu Xuezhong, stating that the vanguard of the Central Army had passed Cizhou and set a deadline for occupying Shunde and approaching Shijiazhuang in order to join forces with the Northeast Army to attack Shi's troops. (Special telegraph from the 24th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Zhengtai Railway Bureau was originally located in Shijiazhuang, but recently moved all its files to Beiping because Shi Yousan's troops were approaching Shijiazhuang. (Special telegraph from the 24th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Wang Shuchang returned to Tianjin from Beiping at 12:00 midnight on the 23rd and plans to go to the Jinpu Railway on the 25th to inspect defenses. He will also go to Jinan to meet with Han Fuqu to discuss joint defense. A special train was prepared and lit up on the evening of the 24th. (Special telegraph from the 24th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Xueming returned to Tianjin today (Special telegraph from the 24th).</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) Residents of Shijiazhuang are flocking to Taiyuan to seek refuge. The Zhengtai Railway added two passenger trains on the 23rd to transport them, and all the guest houses are already overcrowded. (Special telegraph from the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Military sources say that although Shi has proposed surrender, the radio station still picked up Shi's telegram to Guangzhou seeking assistance, as well as other important military information and false accusations that friendly forces had agreements with him. He stated that he would temporarily negotiate with the central government as a delaying tactic. This shows that Shi's rebellious intentions are even more serious. (Special telegraph from the 24th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Headquarters received a telegram from Jiangxi stating that Shi Yousan had the wolfish ambition to collude with the communists and rebel. The central government has ordered all forces in the north and south to prepare for suppression. Knowing that resolution is imminent, he changed his tune and telegraphed to beg for surrender. This is a common trick of Shi the rebel, and no one in the country believes him. Zhang, the Deputy Commander, has been ordered to proceed according to the original plan, punishing only the ringleader and not prosecuting those who were coerced. If his subordinates arrest and hand over Shi the rebel, the central government may cease the suppression and consider reorganization to show leniency. (Special telegraph from the 24th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Military sources say that Shi Yousan was unable to purchase ammunition and that the Guangdong funds were not delivered. He had received 400,000 yuan but was unable to obtain the remaining 600,000. Seeing that the central government and the Northeast were prepared, he knew he could not resist and suddenly telegraphed Han Fuqu and Ma Hongkui to surrender, hoping to preserve his strength. Yesterday, Zhang Xueliang telegraphed headquarters, saying that Shi was fickle and had defrauded the government of funds seven times. If he is not dealt with now, he will eventually become a threat to the heart. Shi has recently recruited communists who remain by his side and participate in important affairs. Gui系 politicians such as He Minhun are also with Shi. His intentions are to create a terrifying situation in the Central Plains. How can the people of the country continue to tolerate him and leave an obstacle to the unification of the north and south? To remove the Qingfu is to quell the troubles of Lu. In addition to obeying the Generalissimo's order to instruct the two group commanders to lead their troops to suppress him, I am sending this special telegram to inform you. (Special telegraph from the 24th)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The Garrison Headquarters received a telegram from Zhangde stating that Shi Yousan was isolated and without assistance due to his recent actions. His troops are now moving from Shunde towards Zizhou. The vanguard of the Central Army has arrived in Zhangde and is gradually advancing. (Special telegraph from the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Wang Jun recently told reporters that Shi Yousan's actions were self-destructive. Zhang, the Deputy Commander, has provided sufficient guarantees for the situation in North China. The central government issued the suppression order only as a last resort to maintain peace. (Special telegraph from the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Military news: Gu Zhutong has arrived in Xinxiang. (Special telegraph from the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Railway news: The Mi Wenhe division of Shi Yousan's troops stationed in Zhangde blew up the Zhanghe Railway Bridge on the night of the 16th, and all troops moved north. (Special telegraph from the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Bian telegram: Due to Shi Yousan's actions, the magistrate of Anyang County telegraphed the Bian Military Headquarters to request instructions, stating that Shi's troops had withdrawn northward from that area. (Special telegraph from the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Henan news: People's organizations in the Zhangde area, seeing that Shi's troops had withdrawn northward from their defenses, telegraphed the Henan provincial government to request that troops be sent to fill the defenses. (Special telegraph from the 22nd)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) Shijiazhuang news: Shi's troops are still in Shijiazhuang and have not advanced. Nine Northeast aircraft bombed Shijiazhuang on the 23rd, killing more than a hundred people. (Special telegraph from the 23rd)</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Xueliang replied in a telegram to Ma Hongkui, saying that Shi Yousan's act of raising troops and creating chaos is perverse and goes against the tide. All comrades in arms hate it. I have instructed my subordinates to be on strict guard and wait for an appropriate opportunity to join forces with comrades in the north and south to advance together and suppress him in the shortest possible time.

<p>(Beiping) Chiang Kai-shek and Zhang Xueliang issued a message today to the troops of the 13th Route Army, saying that this military action is not to make things difficult for the officers and men of the 13th Route Army, but to suppress the fickle, shameless, and untrustworthy Shi Yousan alone. The rest will not be investigated deeply. Now, three rules are set: 1. Those who can offer Shi Yousan's head and surrender will be promoted by two ranks and rewarded with 20,000 yuan. 2. Those who surrender with their troops will be promoted by one rank. 3. Individuals who surrender with weapons will be given 20 yuan at their discretion. (Special telegraph from the 24th)</p>

<p>(Hankou) Military news: Duan's bandits in Honghu are showing signs of fleeing due to the large amount of water and lack of food. They are being suppressed by the two brigades of Xu Dezhuo and Rong Jingfang, as well as the Yinghan and Honggang rounds, and the bandits are hiding in the center of the lake. (Special telegraph from the 23rd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Military sources: (1) Zhu Shaoliang's troops, together with Zhang Zhen's troops on the Fujian border, braved the rain to fiercely suppress the Red Army that fled from Ruijin. They made contact at Wangtian, fifty li away from Ruijin, killing hundreds of bandits and three pseudo-battalion commanders, and occupied the area that evening. (2) Guo Rudong's troops blocked and suppressed the remnants of Kong's bandits who fled to Longgang and Yanxia, ​​killing a Red Guard captain named Zhu Huachi. The remaining bandits are still being suppressed. (3) Yuan Ying's troops fought fiercely with thousands of communist bandits for a day and night in Xiaodian, east of Linxiang, killing many bandits and capturing more than two hundred pseudo-squad leaders and platoon leaders. (Special telegraph from the 24th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Kong's bandits fled to Dasha Ping and are being jointly suppressed by the two troops of Guo Rudong and Xu Tingyao. A telegram was also sent to Tan Daoyuan to send troops to intercept them. (Special telegraph from the 24th)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) The Party and Government Council promulgated regulations on organizing the populace into baojia in bandit areas, recruiting refugees, and providing for the resettlement of those who were coerced and now repent. Jiang Bochang was also appointed as a member of the Party Design Committee. Jiang ordered that propaganda for bandit suppression be guided by the Party. The Red Army's center of gravity has shifted to Ruijin. (Special telegraph from the 24th)</p>

<p>(Nanchang) Sun Dianying sent a telegram to Chiang and dispatched Councilor Fu to Jiangxi to express his support for the central government. Jiang also received a telegram from Sun stating the details of the detention of his subordinate, Instructor Liu, by Shi Yousan. He also said that Shi was ignorant of men. What else is there to say? Well-wishers speak of Shi and Sun, or Sun and Shi. I consider it petty to see Sun in this way, even though I am foolish. (Special telegraph from the 24th)</p>
<h3 id="e8">The Central Propaganda Department Hosts the Press <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Chen Bulei and Ye Chucang Report on the Situation</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Propaganda Department hosted the press on the 24th, with more than thirty reporters from Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai and other places attending. Chairman Chen Bulei first explained the current situation and the relationship between external aggression and internal troubles. He then said that he hoped the media would pay attention to four things: (1) Emphasize the significance of exterminating the communist bandits as the foundation for cleansing chaos and saving the nation, so that compatriots across the country can focus their efforts on eliminating national disasters. (2) Clarify the meaning that internal strife cannot be continued, and use the power of public opinion to judge reactionaries and pay attention to national disasters, and unite with resolute and diligent efforts, orderly and step-by-step actions to assist the government in conducting diplomacy. (3) Do our best to expose the conspiracy of the Japanese in this atrocity to the international community. Next, Ye Chusuo reported that Shi Yousan's rebellion and the Wan case seemed to have been premeditated. When bandit suppression was in full swing, Guangdong sent Chen Youren, Liu Jiwen and others to Japan to purchase equipment, and at the same time, the Wan case came into being. Shi Yousan rebelled at this time. Observing these three points, the domestic reactionary elements and the foreign imperialists are indeed colluding with each other. Recent reports said that Chairman Chiang is about to issue a declaration, the content of which will take domestic stability and resistance to foreign aggression as the goal to deal with everything. There has been heavy rain recently, and the central government is extremely anxious. Solving this matter is more difficult than military and diplomatic matters. This year, there has been a lot of rainfall in the country. The Huaihe River and the Yangtze River on both sides of the north have become flooded. With the current rainfall, the south of the Yangtze River is also very dangerous. Regarding relief measures, the central government is planning and hopes to awaken general attention and find ways to provide relief. (Special telegraph from the 24th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) It has rained continuously in Beijing for three days and nights. The Qinhuai River is higher than the banks. The water is a foot deep in each household. The city government also has water up to its shins. The Public Works Bureau transported a large number of sandbags and placed them along the Qinhuai River bank, but the river water rose again, and the water passed the sandbags. The embankments were ineffective. All the seedlings in the suburbs were submerged, and the poor people cried and moved to avoid it. The area under Beijige is relatively high, and a large number of refugees are fleeing in the rain to seek help. In various roads in the city, women are often seen carrying women across the water. This is the first giant flood in twenty years. (Special telegraph from the 24th)</p>

Two Baogaishan cave entrances at the Zhenjiang Station of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway were collapsed and blocked the cave entrances. The railway track between Longtan and Qixia was submerged and washed away by water. All trains going up and down were suspended at 3 pm. The Beijing-Hangzhou and Juzhen highways also suffered a lot of damage. Long-distance telephone communication is unavailable. The wilderness is already showing signs of disaster.

Now, Korean residents Cao Yu and Han Gui went to the city's Party headquarters to report the truth about the massacre. Cheng Zongdi, the director of the organization department of the association, received them. Cao said that a small number of bad elements in our country were instigated by Japanese imperialists to brutally kill your compatriots. The main reasons are: (1) Japan formulated a new strategy of aggression against Manchuria and Mongolia, using the pretext of deploying a large army into China. (2) The sinister intention of provoking animosity between the Chinese and Korean peoples. Han said that our country was destroyed by Japan, and we have a deeper understanding of Japan. People with lofty ideals all hold the spirit of "rather be a broken jade than a complete tile" and deeply rely on your country's support. (Special telegraph from the 24th)</p>

Regarding the extent of damage to overseas Chinese in the Korean incident and future negotiation policies, he told the Tei Tushin correspondent who visited him that the total amount of damage to overseas Chinese in Korea is more than 2.4 million yuan, and there is no hope of recovery at present. Therefore, China must demand that the Japanese government compensate for the full amount of the damage. The Japanese side believes that the Korean incident was a means of retaliation by Koreans against the oppression of Chinese officials and civilians against Koreans in Manchuria and Korea. As far as I know, Chinese officials and civilians have never oppressed Koreans. After the inspection and investigation, I will go to Nanjing to report in detail. As a result, committees from China and Japan will jointly investigate. (Teletong News Agency Telegraph, 24th)</p>

<h3 id="e46">London Seven-Nation Conference Concludes <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Postponement of 100 Million Yuan Debt Due for Three Months</p>
<p>Organizing Committee to Investigate Germany's Financial Situation</p>
<p>Conference Results Not Fully Satisfactory</p>
<p>Only Able to Maintain the Precarious Situation for a Time</p>
<p>President Hoover Expresses Satisfaction</p>
<p>Many Germans Feel Disappointed</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 23rd: The Seven-Nation Conference concluded today, passing articles of agreement aimed at relieving Germany's current financial crisis: (1) The 100 million yuan debt of the central bank due at maturity will be extended for three months. (2) A joint method will be adopted to maintain the debt already lent to Germany. The Bank for International Settlements has been asked to organize a committee to investigate Germany's need to continue borrowing and to study the possibility of converting some short-term debt into long-term debt. The meeting expressed the opinion that the guarantee of German connections, recently presented to the cash discount bank, should enable Germany to establish a method of resuming normal international financial operations on a sound basis. The meeting also believed that if such a plan were implemented, it could serve as a basis for future and more permanent actions. The London Conference closed in a friendly atmosphere.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 22nd: At the close of the Seven-Nation Conference, representatives from France, the United States, Germany, and other countries thanked Chairman MacDonald and the British government. French Prime Minister Laval said that he would like to speak on behalf of the American representative, who came to participate in the plan to save the unstable European economy with a powerful combination of ideals and practical awareness. We are extremely grateful to them. The historical event recently held in Paris, namely the meeting of the French and German authorities, will give the London Conference special strength and relevance. He wished to express to the representatives present his hope that the preliminary talks held in Paris were only the prelude to many similar meetings, which could become a policy of French-German cooperation and the most reliable guarantee of world security. The US Secretary of State followed with a speech, referring to the meeting of the French and German authorities in Paris, saying that he wished to express the admiration of the United States for the historically valuable impact of the Paris meeting on peace and credit. Now that the Americans have witnessed this major event, they hope to see it continue to be effective. President Beluning said that he agreed with the French President and wished the American representative to bring back from the London Conference a close interrelationship between the new and old worlds and a recognition of the need for spiritual assistance from the American people for Europe. As for the Paris meeting, he firmly believed in the necessity of mutual trust and cooperation between France and Germany, because in the current situation of daily new developments, the rulers must meet frequently. Only mutual trust and cooperation can improve the situation, he said. Representatives from Italy, Belgium, and Japan also gave speeches. Finally, British Prime Minister MacDonald gave a reply, first mentioning the welcome meeting in Paris of the French and German representatives, then the gradual understanding and cooperation between Europe and the United States, and then saying that the economic and spiritual tension felt by various countries would become more and more intense until the countries could think of humanity and not just their own country. He hoped that the decisions of the conference could restore German credit.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Washington, 23rd: President Hoover criticized the results of the London Conference, saying that the conference had laid the foundation for Germany to restore stability. The suspension of intergovernmental debt payments had already been agreed upon, and this conference had supplemented it. The effect of the connection should enable the Germans to overcome their temporary difficulties with their industry and courage and restore their credit. The main event was the issue of the terms of the bank debt. It would be better for this matter to be resolved by the voluntary cooperation of world bankers, rather than by governments with conflicting interests. And the basis for this cooperation is now in place. The resolutions of the conference can help restore the world economy, he said. President Hoover praised the moderate spirit of the conference and sent telegrams of congratulations to Secretary of State Stimson and Treasury Secretary Mellon.</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, London, 23rd: According to the declaration made by Beluning today to German journalists regarding the results of the Seven-Nation Conference, it is still barely satisfactory. Beluning said that the resolutions of this conference largely coincide with Germany's expectations and are quite sufficient to solve the current temporary crisis, because the German cabinet has never had any extravagant hopes from the beginning, wanting to cure the diseases of Germany and the whole of Europe like a magic elixir, and to lift the chronic diseases suddenly. As for long-term borrowing, it is only a temporary solution, which can only moisten the tips but cannot cure the root. Furthermore, according to the current market in London, it is practically impossible to promote long-term bonds. Therefore, the only plan now is to extend the repayment of short-term debts and study the possibility of converting short-term debts into long-term debts. And how to prevent domestic and foreign capital from being withdrawn from Germany is also one of the important points.</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Berlin, 23rd: Although Prime Minister Beluning's declaration to German journalists in London was extremely optimistic, this attitude has not yet been understood by the domestic newspapers. The entire German public opinion now says that Beluning and others no longer need to defend themselves, because the results of the German people's expectations day and night for several days have become a pie in the sky. From now on, they must seek help from themselves and cannot seek help from others. The pessimism of this argument is also shared by the government-affiliated Germania newspaper, which said that the coming and going of the banking inspection team decided in London could only be a posthumous repentance for Germany, and would not help the dead. The newspaper also said that Germany has paid 24.5 billion gold yuan in reparations in the past seven years, and the loss of international trade is 15 billion gold yuan. The blood of the Germans has been drained. If they do not address the reduction of reparations, the Germans have no hope of survival.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 23rd: The theory of "a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush" does not apply to the results of the London Conference. Although there was no agreement on a large loan, and the possibility of future revisions to the Young Plan, which was initiated a few weeks ago, has fallen into obscurity, the German representatives returned with a panacea that was just enough to alleviate their immediate needs, plus the comforting thought that the Franco-German cloudiness had now been lifted and that the United States was now actively paying attention to European difficulties. The London newspapers believed that the crisis was only temporarily postponed. Their arguments are briefly summarized as follows: The Daily Telegraph said that the conference certainly did not achieve a final solution. The Morning Post said that it would be a big mistake to say that Germany could permanently restore its credit with this meager plan. The Daily Express said that the crisis will continue to exist until a collapse occurs or a more severe and permanent method is adopted. The Times said that only a firm promise to reconsider the treaty and war debts can bring about the dawn that illuminates the darkness of Europe.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, New York, 23rd: The insufficient results of the London Conference were disappointing, as can be seen from the opening price drop of one or two pounds on the stock exchange this morning. Bankers said that London banks are getting high interest rates, obviously wanting to prevent the continued outflow of cash from England, and perhaps intending to suck cash into London. However, it is expected that as far as New York is concerned, it may not be possible to suck cash into London at present.</p>

<h3 id="e47">The Disaster of Incessant Rain <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Recently, there has been persistent and prolonged rain, without a break in the clouds for days. Even when there is a brief clearing, dark clouds quickly gather again, and heavy rain pours down. Major cities such as Nanjing and Shanghai have accumulated water that has turned into canals, with the roads becoming vast expanses of water. Furthermore, the banks of the Yangtze River, the Yellow River, the Huai River, and the lake regions across the country have all been ravaged by floods, turning into marshlands. This includes counties in Hunan such as Changde, Xiangtan, Xupu, Linxiang, Yuanjiang, Yuanling, Huarong, and Yueyang; counties in Anhui such as Anqing, Hefei, Wuhu, Bengbu, Huoqiu, Fengtai, Fuyang, Yingshang, Mengcheng, Sixian, Shouxian, Huaiyuan, Xuyi, Dingyuan, Fengyang, and Mingguang; areas in Jiangsu such as Gaoyou, Qingjiangpu, Yangzhou, Guazhou, and Wuxi; counties in Henan such as Xinyang, Luyi, Mengxian, Jiyuan, Dengfeng, Xiangcheng, and Linying; and areas in Guangdong such as Guangzhou and areas along the East River, the West River, and the North River. Almost the entire country, from east to west and north to south, is experiencing devastating floods. The raging waves have swept across the land, and wherever the torrents reach, houses and crops are completely destroyed. There is no hope for the autumn harvest, and even the survivors have nowhere to live. Furthermore, with the floodwaters rising, the number of people who have tragically drowned is impossible to calculate. Across the land, north and south, the cries of suffering are everywhere. The current disaster situation is indeed tragic, and the looming desolation in the future is even more frightening. This is a massive disaster unprecedented in history, and it is a serious problem that our government and our people should pay close attention to and prepare to remedy at the moment. In the past few decades, our country has suffered from natural disasters and man-made calamities almost every year. Windstorms, hail, floods, droughts, insect plagues, epidemics, and even war and banditry – one disaster has not ended before another arrives. For example, last year's drought in Suiyuan, Chahar, Ningxia, Qinghai, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Henan; the banditry in Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Fujian; and the war disasters along the Longhai, Jinpu, and Pinghan lines in the previous year have left scenes of starvation and devastation, with desolate roads and barren lands. According to the statistics of the Relief Commission in the 19th year, a total of approximately 831 counties across the country were affected by disasters, accounting for more than two-fifths of the total number of counties in the country. Among them, Hubei, Ningxia, and Qinghai were not included. The total number of disaster victims was approximately 47,846,700, accounting for more than one-tenth of the total population of the country. Among them, disaster victims in 137 counties were not included. Through comprehensive extrapolation, the total number of disaster victims across the country is estimated to be around 60 million. This huge number is enough to shock us. If we add the disaster areas and disaster victims currently being washed away by the floods, the increase in the number will be even more staggering. Alas, what crime have these ordinary people committed? The dead are exposed, and the living are displaced. Some are even unable to relocate and are trapped waiting to die. Tree roots, leaves, tattered cotton, and yellow soil are all scavenged in search of something to fill their empty stomachs. Are there any events more heartbreaking and devastating than this? In the past, when the level of human civilization was low, the causes of disasters were not known for prevention, and when disasters struck, there was no resistance. People often attributed them to fate, calling them natural disasters. They simply lamented the injustice of Heaven and looked up to the sky to await death. This was due to the limitations of knowledge and the lack of power. We cannot blame the ancients too much. However, since modern times, human civilization has become increasingly developed. The causes of all these disasters and the methods of prevention have been known to civilized countries, which have actively strived to remedy and prevent natural disasters with scientific methods. Except for earthquakes and tsunamis, for which there is still no solution, most can be addressed by human effort. The saying that "Heaven and Earth are not benevolent and treat all things as straw dogs" is hardly worth a laugh in the 20th century. Therefore, if disasters still occur on Earth today, it is not truly Heaven-sent, and the blame lies entirely with people. For the people who suffer in the disaster, it is a tragic death. For the country where the disaster occurs, it is an even greater shame and humiliation. European and American countries attach great importance to this, and governments and people work together to eliminate the root causes of disasters. Even if disasters occur occasionally, they work together to remedy them and never sit idly by and watch disasters occur once, twice, or countless times without paying attention. Only our country seems not to be in today's civilized world, and the people are still constantly subjected to the persecution and attacks of nature. Droughts, floods, epidemics, and even the intentionally created war and banditry – one disaster has not ended before another arrives. For decades, they have continued endlessly, and the whole country waits for the tragic devastation without any prevention. This is truly a unique phenomenon in our country. For example, the current overflowing Yangtze River and Yellow River – if we had methods to prevent them and ways to guide them, they would be of great benefit to the country. However, because there is no proper way, the benefit becomes a harm. What could have been a blessing to the people ends up killing them. Our government has indeed established a River Conservancy Commission, but the result of the conservancy ultimately leads to people and livestock being washed away and homes being destroyed. This is truly enough to make us frown and sigh deeply. The past is gone, but the future can be pursued. Today, we have nothing else to say but to sincerely hope for two things: (1) In the future, our government should earnestly study the scientific methods of preventing and resisting disasters and universally educate the people so that they can work together to make efforts. (2) We should plan and implement remedies for this flood as soon as possible, so as to prevent the disaster area from expanding and the disaster victims from having a place to return to. Moreover, for years, various places have been suffering from devastating calamities, and millions of compatriots have fallen into a human hell where they cannot seek death or seek life. Anyone with a heart must feel grieved. Those of us who are fortunate enough not to be affected by the disaster should unanimously save food and clothing and plan for relief, collecting funds for aid and rescue. Now is the time. If we ignore the suffering of others, then the reporter has no words, but only to weep for the compassion of mankind, to weep for the dignity of our country, and to weep aloud in advance for the countless compatriots who are waiting to die a tragic death later.</p>

<p>▲ National News Agency, Madrid, 23rd: Street fighting broke out in Seville last night. Dozens of workers were killed in the riots, hundreds were injured, and more than a thousand were arrested. The army authorities had issued a warning in advance, stating that any house from which shots were fired would be shelled. Therefore, many houses were destroyed for violating the order. The rioters placed women and children at the forefront, attacking the barracks of the security forces, resulting in numerous casualties among women and children. Later, seeing that their ambitions were not achieved, they surrendered one after another. The remaining crowds were terrified and fled to the countryside. Although riots still occur from time to time, the authorities are confident that the local area will return to normal within a day or two. Martial law has now been declared in Seville and throughout the province of Andalusia. The central government believes that the riots were entirely masterminded by the Industrial Revolutionary Party, so it issued an order today declaring that all labor unions related to the party are illegal organizations, and it searched the party headquarters, arresting several leaders.</p>

<p>Restrictions on Bank Withdrawals Slightly Relaxed</p>
<p>Additional Subsidiary Coins Minted and Circulated</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 23rd: According to a Reuters dispatch from Berlin, restrictions on bank withdrawals for current accounts have now been slightly relaxed. The government has issued a new order allowing banks to pay out 10% of deposits, but not exceeding 200 marks, which is 5% more than previously allowed. Savings bank depositors are now allowed to withdraw 30 marks, which is 10 marks more than previously allowed.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Berlin, 23rd: The German government has issued many emergency orders recently, including one amending the August 1924 law. Previously, the minting of silver coins was limited to 20 marks per capita in Germany. Now, this limit has been increased to 30 marks per capita. Therefore, Germany can mint silver coins worth approximately 1,900,000,000 marks. The amount of silver coins in circulation on July 15 was 1,068,000,000 marks. It is not yet known whether the National Bank will use its power to increase the circulation of silver coins to the limit allowed by the new order. However, it can be considered certain that the National Bank will issue a large number of silver coins. The National Bank has not yet purchased silver, because there is still a supply in the treasury, so this order has not affected the price of silver. Compared with the silver price ten days ago, it is now one mark lower per kilogram.</p>

<p>To all newspaper offices: Having recently read the telegram from Chief Commander Liu Jingfu et al., its righteousness and solemnity are deeply moving, and the entire army is filled with indignation. Reflecting on the frequent rise of reactionary forces in recent years, leading to the spread of the Red Scourge, the ceaseless internal strife has invited the pressure of external forces, placing the future of the nation in a precarious state. This summer, our Commander-in-Chief, General Chiang Kai-shek, entered Jiangxi to supervise the army and personally led the front lines. Fortunately, the officers and soldiers were dutiful and victorious in every direction. The Red Scourge is about to be eradicated, and the national lifeline can be preserved. Unexpectedly, at the time when the Red Bandits were exhausted and their momentum weakened, and when our officers and soldiers were fighting fiercely and bitterly, the flames of war suddenly arose in northern Hebei, and alarming news came from southern Guangdong. These treacherous elements are snake-hearted and scorpion-minded, acting like wolves in collusion. What has the nation done to wrong them that they must break the already achieved unity? What harm have the people done to them that they must prolong the dying breath of the Red Bandits? Yingqin and others, under the mandate of the party and the nation, organize and lead the armies, following only the missions of the central government and preserving only the unity of the nation. Honor or disgrace is immaterial, but right and wrong must be made clear. Praise or criticism can be ignored, but truth and falsehood must be distinguished. Profit and loss can be disregarded, but national traitors must be eliminated. Life and death can be ignored, but justice must be upheld. How can we bear to let our five thousand years of culture be subjugated by barbarians? How can we allow the four hundred million people to be plunged into misery? We sincerely hope that all compatriots across the nation and all comrades-in-arms in the army will work together with the greatest effort to achieve final success, to completely eradicate the bandit rebels, and to strictly punish the traitors. The nation and the people will benefit immensely. Respectfully conveying our heartfelt intentions, we ask for your consideration. He Yingqin, Chen Mingshu, Lu Diping, Zhu Shaoliang, Sun Lianzhong, Jiang Guangnai, Jiang Dingwen, Zhao Guantao, Chen Cheng, Shangguan Yunxiang, Tan Daoyuan, Hao Mengling, Wei Lihuang, Gao Shuxun, Lu Xiaochen, Zhou Hunyuan, Mao Bingwen, Luo Zhuoying, Li Yunjie, Xu Kexiang, Gong Bingshen, Guo Huazong, Han Deqin, Li Menghang, Ruan Zhaochang, Cai Tingkai, Dai Ji, Luo Lin, Qiu Zhaochen, Tang Enbo, Liu Yi, Ma Zhaotong, respectfully bow and seal.</p>

<p>To all newspaper offices: Having recently read the telegram from Chairman Liu of Kaifeng et al., its words are solemn and its righteousness is deeply admired by all. Reflecting on the current situation, with the great powers watching from without and the Red Bandits raging within, wherever their fierce attacks reach, utter ruin is feared. Our Commander-in-Chief, General Chiang Kai-shek, concerned about the nation's perilous state and distressed by the people's hardships, swiftly marches in the sweltering heat to save the people from fire and water. Just as the front lines are engaged in bloody battles, we hear that the Japanese imperialists are harming our overseas Chinese. Anyone with blood and spirit should rise up together to drive out the jackals and tigers and jointly strive for the survival of the nation. If unscrupulous elements, oblivious to the course of events, still harbor evil intentions and are willing to act perversely and undermine unity, we can only denounce their crimes and prepare for battle, vowing to eliminate the nation's vermin, share a common hatred, and forever eradicate the destructive elements. We respectfully express our heartfelt intentions and hope for your consideration. The Jiangxi Provincial Government bows respectfully.</p>

<h3 id="e59">A Study on Korean People Migrating and Settling in the Northeast <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>(Continuation 2) Bin</p>
<p>"The two regions, large and small, originally had natural boundaries. The Tumen River (i.e., the Tumangang River)" divides the jurisdiction between Jilin and Hamgyong-Pyeongan provinces. For three hundred years, the borders have been peaceful. The ignorant people of our country, disregarding the prohibitions and crossing the boundaries, secretly cultivate the land. Fortunately, they were dealt with leniently and not punished, but allowed to remain. However, their customs are different, and their environments are dissimilar. These people were born and raised in our country. Now, because of the land occupation, they are being brought under your jurisdiction. If any trouble arises, it is a matter of deep concern. It is requested that all Korean refugees in the Hunchun and Dunhua areas of Jilin be returned to their country. They should be handed over to the local officials to be managed for repatriation. The official land in Jilin that has already been cultivated by Korean people should be managed and rented by the Jilin authorities. Strict prohibitions should be clearly stated to prevent future malpractices, so that</p>
<p>the border people of our country will no longer cross the border."</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that at that time, the Korean people crossed the border to cultivate purely out of hunger. They all knew that they were violating the prohibitions and had absolutely no desire for our land. Moreover, at that time, the Korean people's cross-border cultivation was limited to the areas opposite Musan, such as the Outer Six Dao Gou. There was none in the area north of the Tumen River below Musan. In the sixteenth year of the Guangxu reign, the Prime Minister's Office requested that the cross-cultivated land be registered, taxed, licensed, and rented, and placed under the jurisdiction of local officials. In the twentieth year of Guangxu, the General of Jilin requested the establishment of a Reclamation Bureau to handle the matter as requested by the Prime Minister's Office. As a result, all those Korean people who had crossed the border were registered, taxed, and licensed. They lived off the land and became part of our territory, thus gaining land ownership. The following is an excerpt from the Prime Minister's Office's memorial:</p>
<p>"Korean refugees occupy and cultivate the border of Jilin. In the seventh year of Guangxu, the former General Ming'an and Wu Dachun, who was in charge of border defense affairs, requested and were approved to investigate the household registration of these refugees and assign them to the jurisdiction of Hunchun and Dunhua counties. Later, the King of Korea requested the return of the refugees, and the Ministry of Rites forwarded the request, asking the Generals and others to reply. Approval was given for a one-year deadline for the local officials of that country to find a way to take them back. Later, because the deadline had expired, that country still did not return the refugees, but instead allowed them to cross the river and encroach upon the land. The former General Xi Yuan consulted the Prime Minister's Office and requested approval to send officials to survey the area together. (Omission) However, the King of that country did not consider the matter carefully, but hastily believed the biased words of the boundary demarcation envoy Li Chongxia, and firmly requested that the Hongshan River be established as the boundary, which was difficult to reconcile. However, it is not appropriate to delay the issue of cross-border cultivation due to the boundary demarcation. Currently, in the areas of Guangji Yu, Liu Dao Gou, and Shiba Sui Zi, etc., east of the opposite bank of the Musan Prefecture of Korea, Korean people have cultivated the land across the border. There are about several thousand people, and the land is about tens of thousands of qing. Since there is a natural boundary of the Tumen River here, there is no need to survey it again. That country has been procrastinating until now, and it is impossible to return the refugees. We should immediately follow the previous decree and order them to obtain licenses and pay taxes, and place them under our jurisdiction. We should first send officials to clear the land, register them, and collect taxes, so that the border people can live in peace, etc. We have investigated the Korean border affairs of Jilin. The reason why the two previous joint surveys could not be finalized is only the source of the Tumen River, which is more than two hundred li directly above Musan to the Three Pao Ji. As for below Musan, the Tumen River is a huge river and a natural boundary. The south bank of the river is the six prefectures of Musan, Hoeryong, Jongseong, Onseong, Gyeongwon, and Gyeongheung, which belong to Hamgyong Province of that country. The boundary demarcation envoy of that country also has no different opinions. Korean people have been cultivating the land across the border for many years, and their tombs face each other. If all of them are ordered to return at once, several thousand people will lose their jobs and have no support. Not only is the situation pitiful, but there is also no way to solve it urgently. If we allow them to live as people of foreign nationality for a long time, and the hosts and guests are not distinguished, it is not a long-term plan. However, in recent years, the farmers in that area have repeatedly gone to Jilin to file lawsuits against the Korean people for collecting taxes on cross-border cultivation and various harsh disturbances. Li Hongzhang, the Minister of Beiyang, consulted our office and has a record of the case. As the original memorial said, the Korean officials exploit the suffering of the people, and the refugees enjoy the lightness of our taxes. It can be seen that they are sincerely happy and attached to their land. Now that the boundary of Jiangyuan is difficult to delineate on a fixed date, there is no need to survey the place. It seems appropriate to appease them in a timely manner to comfort the hearts of the refugees who have returned. It is proposed to order the General to select virtuous officials to clear the land and collect taxes (omission), obtain licenses and pay taxes, and place them under the jurisdiction of local officials. All detailed regulations should be investigated by the General and reported for handling."</p>
<p>From the above memorial, it can be seen that today's Yanbian issue was actually caused at that time. At that time (the sixteenth year of Guangxu), there were thousands of Korean people in Guangji Yu, Liu Dao Gou, and Shiba Sui Zi, etc., east of the opposite bank of the Musan Prefecture of Korea. The cultivated land reached tens of thousands of qing, which is a historically noteworthy fact.</p>
<p>However, the only thing is that at that time, the Korean people who crossed the border to cultivate were only in the area under the jurisdiction of today's Helongyu Experience Office, the area of ​​land reclamation (i.e., the area under the jurisdiction of the Yanji Sub-Prefecture). There was absolutely none. Later, the number of Korean people who crossed the border to cultivate increased day by day. Many Chinese people who contracted wasteland for reclamation hired Koreans as tenant farmers, and some even sold wasteland to Korean people. As a result, before long, the basins of the Hailan River, the Burhatong River, and the Gaya River, as well as the entire Yanji territory, were filled with the footprints of Korean people. Later, Korean people coveted the fertile land and abundant grain production and proceeded to plan for encroachment. In the twenty-eighth and ninth years of Guangxu, there were actions of privately building bridges over the Tumen River, actions of sending officials to cross the river for inspection, actions of Korean officials collecting money across the border, actions of disputing the fake river in the Tumen River as Jiandao (the name Jiandao first appeared here), and actions of Li Fanyun leading troops across the river to rob and injure Chinese people. Finally, after severely prohibiting the riotous party of Korean people, there were several years of peaceful coexistence. As a result, the Japanese coveted it and wanted to use the selfish desire of good people who crossed the border to cultivate for their own benefit to secretly carry out their means of encroaching on our territory. In the thirty-third year of Guangxu, the boundary issue arose. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e61">Wang Jun Talks About the Recent Situation of Shi's Troops <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>▲Shi Yousan is Already in a Dilemma</p>
<p>▲Resolving Shi's Troops in a Very Short Time</p>
<p>A dispatch from Xuzhou: Everyone is paying close attention to Shi Yousan's movements. I visited Wang Jun, the commander of the Jinpu Railway Garrison, on the afternoon of the 22nd and asked about the recent situation of Shi's troops. Wang replied in detail. I will briefly describe it as follows: Wang said that Shi Yousan's personality and behavior have long been distrusted by all parties. The reason for this change is partly due to the agitation of the Guangdong side and partly due to Shi's one-sided enticement. The Guangdong side gave Shi the title of group commander and provided him with a huge amount of money, thinking that when the central government was dealing with Guangdong, they could capture Pingjin in one fell swoop. Therefore, when Shi's troops first moved, they unexpectedly disarmed a small part of the Northeast Army's cavalry and moved their troops north at the same time. After the action, although the title and money given by Guangdong had been received, Sun Dianying clearly expressed to Deputy Commander Zhang and Chairman Liu of Henan that he could not agree with Shi. The Jin generals also did not want Shi to harm Shanxi and refused his entry. At the same time, the Northeast Army was fully prepared, and the Central Army was also deployed in a very short time. Shi was in the midst of an attack by the two armies, isolated and helpless, and had lost his ability to advance. Therefore, he recently ordered his troops to move from the base camp of Shunde to the Cangzhou area in order to seek another way out. However, Chairman Han and Commander-in-Chief Ma also did not approve of Shi's actions and had deployed troops to take appropriate precautions. Shi is already in a dilemma. Although the number is said to be 60,000, the actual number of guns is only 30,000. This change is enough to bring about his own destruction. Regarding the situation in North China, the central government has completely entrusted Zhang with this responsibility. Zhang was prepared for Shi's change. The Northeast Army has formed the Northern Route Group Army to prevent Shi's troops. Therefore, the Northeast telegrams all say that the Northeast can solve it with all its strength and have more than enough. The Central Army on the Southern Route was initially only planning to defend the Southern Route to follow behind him. At the moment, the central government is still upholding the fundamental purpose of maintaining peace and intends to stop Shi's change. If the prevention is ineffective, it will use military force to solve it. Therefore, the central government will not issue a decree of punishment unless it is absolutely necessary. As for the deployment of the Central Army, it has not yet reached the stage of public announcement. What can be announced is that the Southern Route Group Army has been formed, with Chairman Liu of Henan in charge, commanding the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Army Corps, with a total of 12 divisions. Commander-in-Chief Gu Zhu Tong has arrived in Xinxiang, and Commander-in-Chief Liu Xueya will also come from Luoyang. I (Wang said himself) will also leave Xuzhou for the west tomorrow (23rd). The transportation of troops has been completely completed to the appropriate location. If Shi's troops do not listen to the restraint, they can be resolved in a very short time. I hope to announce this to the public and do not worry too much.</p>
<p>Recent front-line information has been sent from Zhangde. Shi's troops, Mi Wenhe's division, blew up the Zhang River Railway Bridge on the night of the 16th and moved north away from Zhangde. The troops of the 3rd Army Corps of the Central Government are now advancing from the Pinghan Line. Tang Yunshan's brigade has arrived in Zhangde and is still progressing. The main force of Shi's troops is reportedly moving east from Shunde. Chairman Han has an appropriate plan to divide his forces to reduce the military scope. The artillery brigade of the guard army, Xiang Zhizhuang's troops, have passed through Xu and are heading to Zheng. The 7th Squadron of Aircraft, Zhang Yougu's troops, have passed through Xu from Beijing and are heading west. It is said that the 1st Squadron, Yan Yucong's troops, has also flown directly north from Wuhan (July 22).</p>
<h3 id="e62">Han and Ma Always Obey the Central Government <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>▲Shao Lizi Talks About Shi Yousan's Circular Telegram</p>
<p>A dispatch from Jinan: Since Shi Yousan's change of attitude in Shunde, there have been many rumors from the outside world. However, Han Fuqu and Ma Hongkui have always obeyed the central government, so there will be no special changes in the overall situation in the north. It is heard that the central government, for the convenience of commanding the troops, has specially appointed Han Fuqu as the Commander-in-Chief of the Group Army. The troops of Shandong and Henan provinces are all under his command. The position of Commander-in-Chief of the 1st Army Corps that he left behind is succeeded by Ma Hongkui, Commander-in-Chief of the 15th Route. Hai Tao, the chief staff officer of the 15th Route, followed Ma Hongkui's order on this (22nd)</p>
<p>At four o'clock in the morning, he took a special train from Tai'an to Jinan. After getting off the train, he went to the provincial government to meet with Han to discuss defense issues. Then, at 10:30 a.m. on the same day, he returned to Tai'an from Jinan to report back. Cao Fulin, the commander of the 29th Division of the 3rd Route Army, moved part of his troops to Yucheng under orders and has completed the departure. Therefore, he took a car from Jinan to Yucheng at 10:00 a.m. today (22nd). According to Cao's talk with reporters, part of his troops will be sent to northern Shandong to specialize in bandit suppression and consolidate the province's defense. The division headquarters will be located in Yucheng. Shao Lizi told reporters this afternoon (22nd) that he has seen Shi Yousan's circular telegram. Although Sun Dianying, Liu Guitang, and Liu Ruming are listed, Sun Dianying has expressed his sincere obedience to the central government and stated that he will not participate in Shi's actions. It is thought that Sun Dianying's name must have been falsely listed by Shi. Liu Ruming's personality also cannot act in concert with Shi, or there is another person. Although the situation of Liu Guitang is not clear, his number is only several thousand, which is not a problem. The old generals of the Northwest, Song Zheyuan and Pang Bingxun, and the generals of the Jin army did not participate this time. From Shi's circular telegram, it can be proved that Shi is only acting on a part of the action, and the situation is extremely isolated, which is not difficult to suppress. Although Shi's circular telegram has been issued, the central government still hopes that he will realize his mistake in the end. If Shi leaves the army immediately, there is still room for peace to be saved.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Overseas Chinese Refugees from Korea Arrive in Qingdao One After Another <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>▲A Total of More Than 2,600 People in Recent Days</p>
<p>A dispatch from Qingdao: Overseas Chinese refugees from Korea have returned to China and passed through Qingdao one after another. From the 15th to the 19th, there have been more than 2,000 people. The municipal chamber of commerce and social bureau have tried to accommodate them and sent them back to their hometowns one after another. Yesterday (21st) and today (22nd), two more batches have arrived, totaling more than 600 people. The ones who arrived in Qingdao yesterday were on the Guangli, a ship of the Zhengji Shipping Company, from Andong. They entered the port at 8:00 a.m., totaling 329 men and women. They also carried documents with the seals of the Andong County Government, the Andong Commercial Port Public Security Bureau, and the Andong Municipal Chamber of Commerce, stating that thousands of refugees who had fled to Andong had reached. In addition to trying to accommodate them and raise funds for relief, there are now 329 refugees from Shandong Province, including 22 children, who are taking the Guangli ship of the Zhengji Company to Qingdao to go ashore and return to their hometowns. The ship is purely voluntary and provides free transportation. It is jointly certified to facilitate customs clearance when arriving in Qingdao and presenting it to the customs. After the refugees landed, the Public Security Bureau registered them by name, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Social Bureau sent people to accommodate them. At the same time, they contacted the Shipping Association for ships. On the day they sailed to Shijiusuo, there were only the Tongxing and Qingxing ships. However, the Tongxing was fully loaded and could not accommodate them. Therefore, only the Qingxing loaded 67 refugees and sailed to Shijiusuo that night to land. The rest were temporarily accommodated in the New Stage. This morning, 42 people took the Jiaoji Railway west. This afternoon, at 6:00 p.m., the Shipping Association prepared the Anshun and Zhaoxiang ships to carry 176 people to Shijiusuo. The rest who had no home to return to went to relatives and friends nearby. Just after this batch of refugees was sent away, another batch of refugees arrived in the afternoon. It is heard that they came to Qingdao from Yantai on the 16th Kyodo Maru, totaling 270 men, women, old and young. After landing, the Public Security Bureau, the Social Bureau, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent people to take care of them. A small portion, about 50 people, went directly from the Dagang Wharf to the Xiaogang Wharf to take the ships prepared by the Shipping Association and loaded them with those who came to Qingdao yesterday to return to their hometowns. The majority of more than 200 people, mostly from Qingzhou and Shouguang, needed to take the train west. It was too late to do so on the day and they were still accommodated in the New Stage. It is heard that the Social Bureau and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce have contacted the Jiaoji Railway Bureau for the refugees to take the train. The Railway Bureau has agreed to specially attach two third-class cars to the third train tomorrow to transport the refugees separately back to their hometowns (July 22).</p>
<h3 id="e64">Liaoning Various Legal Bodies Show Attitude Towards Korea <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>▲A Proclamation to the People of Japan and Korea: Since July 3rd, Koreans in various parts of Korea have gathered in crowds, attacking overseas Chinese. Some wielded weapons to surround and attack, others set fires everywhere, looting and destroying houses, and killing people. All kinds of atrocities were used to the extreme, resulting in the corpses of our defenseless compatriots piled up like pillows, their blood flowing. Those who were spared also lost their property and became displaced. The turmoil has expanded and intensified. As of today, it has been a week and there is no sign of it subsiding. The bad news has spread and people are shocked. Such a great tragedy in the world not only makes the Chinese people grieve, but also knowledgeable people in Japan and Korea, for the sake of humanity and diplomacy, should also harbor endless regret. The Chinese people believe that the cause of this disaster is absolutely incredible. According to newspaper reports, the Japanese authorities stated that "the direct cause was the Wanbaoshan Incident, and the fundamental cause was the accumulation of resentment from years of oppression of Korean farmers in Northeast China, which led to the current retaliatory act." However, the Chinese people find this explanation even more difficult to understand. The facts of the Wanbaoshan Incident were witnessed and heard by everyone. Unless deliberately confusing right and wrong, it cannot be said that the fault lies with China. The occurrence of this case was nothing more than someone, in the name of Korean farmers, renting land without legal procedures, cultivating it into rice paddies, diverting water by digging canals, building embankments, digging into the land of other Chinese farmers, and cutting off the navigation of the two counties. Those who were directly affected naturally had to rise up for legitimate self-defense. However, the Japanese authorities took military action, as if facing a formidable enemy. Chinese officials, deeply fearing the deterioration of the situation, tried their best to dissuade and suppress, and the Chinese farmers immediately swallowed their anger and left, quietly awaiting a solution, without any conflict with the Koreans. Not only were no Korean farmers killed or injured, but they are now continuing their construction work under the strict supervision of armed Japanese police. The attitude of the Chinese people is like this, how can they be repaid with revenge? This is one point. As for the claim that Northeast China has been oppressing Korean farmers for years, it is even more of a castle in the air, completely unfounded. The number of Korean farmers who have migrated to Northeast China has been increasing year by year, and has now reached more than a million. Although there are occasionally a small number of people who disrupt public order, the Chinese authorities cannot but crack down on them, but those who are law-abiding have never been subjected to any oppression. The continuous arrival of Korean farmers can be taken as an example. The Chinese authorities treat Korean farmers like this, so where does the resentment come from? This is the second point. As mentioned above, it can be seen that the indiscriminate killing and looting of overseas Chinese by Koreans in Korea seems to have other motives. Many people in the world say that some people are using ignorant crowds to instigate and direct them in order to achieve certain ambitions. The fabrication of news and sensationalism by various Japanese and Korean newspapers also have the suspicion of inciting and confusing. The Chinese people are reluctant to believe all these things, but clues can be found everywhere. Unless there is strong evidence to the contrary, it is difficult to dispel the suspicions of the Chinese people. Moreover, what the Chinese people find most painful is that, according to current international law, even in the event of formal war between two countries, non-combatants of the enemy or combatants who have lost their ability to resist must not be harmed. Now, overseas Chinese in Korea who are legally residing and peacefully earning a living, regardless of age or gender, are being killed indiscriminately for no reason. Even after fleeing, they cannot guarantee their lives. Regardless of the Wanbaoshan Incident, no Korean farmers were killed or injured. Even if there were, it is absolutely unacceptable to use such cruel means against innocent third parties. Disregarding justice and destroying humanity, it can be said that it has reached its limit. Japanese police are known throughout the world for their perfection and thoroughness. They have been able to quickly suppress any past incidents in Korea and restore stability. It is not known why this time they neither made sufficient preparations beforehand nor actively protected them afterward, allowing the overseas Chinese to suffer huge sacrifices and creating an unprecedented tragedy. Therefore, the Chinese people believe that even if the crime was entirely committed by the rioters themselves, the Japanese authorities, who failed to protect their residents in accordance with the treaty, must bear their due responsibility under international practice. It is hoped that there are many enlightened people in friendly countries who will seek to preserve the honor of their civilized and advanced countries. Next, please frankly state the true intentions of the Chinese people regarding the issue of Korean farmers' migration. All the disputes in the past regarding the migration of Korean farmers to Northeast China have stemmed from the issue of dual nationality. If Korean farmers are willing to naturalize and reside for a long time, China can also cooperate. However, after the Korean farmers naturalize, the Japanese authorities do not recognize Chinese nationality law, which leads to disputes from time to time, which in turn involve diplomacy and evolve into various ominous events. China has long hoped for a fundamental solution, but it awaits sincere consultation from the Japanese authorities. In short, the Wanbaoshan rice paddy incident and the Korean massacre in Korea are two completely different matters and cannot be discussed together. It must also be understood that all problems should be solved in a proper way in order to be effective. If all that is done is revenge, it will not only be useless, but also create obstacles, which is not wise. It is hoped that the people of Japan and Korea will pay close attention to the villains, not fall for their tricks, and strive to supervise the government and maintain international friendship. Then, the friendship between China and Japan, the overall situation in East Asia, and world peace will be fortunate. Sincerely, I offer this advice, and I hope you will take it into consideration. Liaoning Provincial National Diplomacy Association, Liaoning Provincial Education Association, Liaoning Provincial Farmers' Association, Liaoning Provincial General Chamber of Commerce Federation, Liaoning Federation of Trade Unions, Liaoning Press Federation, Liaoning Lawyers' Association, Liaoning National Common Sense Promotion Association, Fanyang City Chamber of Commerce, Shenyang City Education Association, Liaoning Youth Association, Liaoning Buddhist Association, respectfully.</p>
<p>▲Reply to the Statement from the Koreans: All colleagues of the Joint Council of Various Circles in Korea, your statement of July 8 has been received with respect. Our association sincerely accepts it. The Chinese and Korean nations not only have close historical, geographical, economic, and cultural ties, but also share the same environment of oppression and exploitation. We should maintain considerable friendship and abandon all doubts. The occurrence of this unfortunate incident is entirely due to incitement by a third party. The Chinese people have a very clear understanding of this and do not harbor any animosity towards the Koreans. In the Wanbaoshan case, the Korean farmers rented rice paddies without legal procedures, which cannot be considered valid. They forcibly dug a canal for twenty-five miles from Mashankou to Wanbaoshan, destroying crops and building a dam on the Yitong River. Farmers cannot but stop illegal infringement of their own interests, but their attitude was very peaceful and no conflict occurred, and there were no casualties. The Chinese anti-Korean reports in the Japanese and Korean newspapers are completely fabricated. On July 2, Chinese farmers filled in the ditch, and the Japanese police first opened fire. There were no casualties on either side. However, the Japanese took the opportunity to send armed military police with several machine guns, digging trenches, burying landmines, and forcibly occupying civilian houses. Such atrocities are unbearable for any nation. Moreover, they incited ignorant Koreans to riot and massacre innocent people, dismembering them and causing an unprecedented tragedy, which is the most heartbreaking thing. However, the Chinese people still have good feelings towards the Koreans living in Korea, and will listen to the government's negotiations with Japan and seek a fair judgment from the world. They will maintain a calm attitude and deal with it. It is hoped that your colleagues will sincerely announce the truth of the Wanbaoshan case and the attitude of the Chinese people towards the Koreans to the people in various parts of Korea, so as to avoid doubts, and not be used by third parties. It is further hoped that after this unfortunate incident, the feelings between the Chinese and Korean nations will become more harmonious. Respectfully replied by the Liaoning Provincial National Diplomacy Association.</p>
<p>▲Attached Translation of the Korean Statement: Representatives from all walks of life sincerely express their regret for the unfortunate incidents that occurred to the Chinese people in Incheon, Seoul, Pyongyang, and other places, triggered by the Wanbaoshan issue. They also declare that the occurrence of this unfortunate incident is definitely not due to the will of the entire Korean nation. They firmly believe that the Chinese and Korean nations, which have the closest relationship in history, geography, culture, and economy, are inevitably in a situation to maintain close friendship and support each other in the present and future. However, this accidental unfortunate incident can still enhance and attempt to be an opportunity to promote the sense of friendship between the two nations. We hope that the Chinese people will understand the true intentions of the Korean nation, and not remember this unfortunate incident. Furthermore, we ask that you abandon the doubts that have always alienated the millions of Korean compatriots in the East, and sweep away the factors that hinder the friendship between the two races, and resolve the issue of the Korean compatriots in the East with magnanimity and goodwill in a reasonable way. Finally, we once again regret that our most well-meaning neighbor suffered misfortune at the hands of our compatriots in our country. At the same time, we sincerely wish our good neighbors a speedy return to normalcy, to live in peace and enjoy a life of happiness and prosperity.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Zhu Mao's Remnant Bandits Invade Ruijin Again <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>▲The Western Fujian Militia Has Been Putting Up a Strong Defense</p>
<p>Shantou, 16th: The Jiangxi Communist bandits Zhu Mao and Peng Huang were attacked from both the left and right wings and could not take care of both ends. They fled towards the border of Fujian. A part of them reached Tingzhou. The city is flat on all sides and there is no natural defense, so the bandit army was able to enter directly. When the bandits arrived, all the shops closed their doors and the residents fled the city. The bandits extorted 10,000 yuan from the Chamber of Commerce. The Chamber of Commerce sent people to collect it everywhere, but only got 7,000 yuan. They were spared burning and killing that day. Local bandits and ruffians took the opportunity to agitate, claiming to overthrow local bullies and killing people in the market. No one dared to intervene. On the morning of the 10th, the bandits suddenly retreated towards Ruijin, Jiangxi, leaving a small part in Tingzhou. No one was in charge of the local area. Shops and houses were closed tightly, and thieves were rampant, searching every house. People were very panic-stricken. On the 15th, Luo Jieren, the commander of the joint security team of Shanghang, Tingzhou, Liancheng, and Yongding, sent He Jiqing to Shantou to ask Commander Zhang Ruigui for assistance with military pay and ammunition. According to He, Luo Jieren guarded the city of Shanghang with about 20,000 militiamen. Zhong Shaokui, Zhong Guanxun, Chen Rongguang, and Chen Shenfu's armed self-defense groups guarded the line from Wuping Fengshi to Yongding, also with about 2,000 people. Lu Xinming's bandit suppression army in Liancheng Qingliu Guihua also had an equal number. Recently, about 2,000 people from the Jiangxi militia led by Li Tianqi, Zhong Wencai, and Pan Manshan have been added to deploy defenses at the border of Wuping. At present, the local armed forces in western Fujian are no less than 7,000 to 8,000 people. It is said that the fleeing bandits in Tingzhou will be wiped out in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>10th: Zhu Mao's remnant troops fled from the Jiangxi border into Tingzhou and were pursued by the bandit suppression army. The main force then retreated back to Ruijin, Jiangxi, leaving only a small part and the fake propaganda team stationed near Changting. Luo Jieren, the commander of the Tinghang Lianyong security team, heard the news and immediately stepped up defenses, transferring the Jiangxi militia led by Zhong Wencai, Li Tianqi, and Pan Manshan to Wuping as reserves, vowing to defend their hometowns with all their strength. Defense works were built at Fengshi Nanshedu Zhongdu (the junction of Shanghang and Yongding), and Zhong Shaokui, Zhong Guanxun, Chen Rongguang, Chen Shenfu, and Chen Delong were assigned to defend them. The militiamen were all brave and good at fighting, and there were heavy troops stationed in the rear areas of Dapu and Yongding on the Fujian-Guangdong border, so the momentum was very strong.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Counterfeit Military Supply Bond Case Discovered in Guangdong Province <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>▲The Printing Company Has Been Sealed</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The Guangdong Finance Authority recently issued 10 million yuan of second military supply bonds. The printing of the bond paper has always been done locally. This time, a tender was opened for printing, and the China Printing Company in the city won the bid with the lowest price. Therefore, the second batch of military bonds was all printed by the company. Since the start of printing, the Finance Department has sent personnel to the company every day to supervise the printing. The procedure was very solemn. The Finance Department has also issued the printed bonds one after another to various agencies and groups for distribution. However, after the bonds were sold, a certain store discovered that the seal of the Finance Department on the bond it recognized was slightly smaller. The store immediately telegraphed the Finance Department for inquiries. The Finance Department immediately retrieved the bond for detailed review and realized that the printing and paper of the bond were not different at all. The only slight difference was the size of the seal of the Finance Department. Therefore, it was determined that there must be a counterfeit military bond agency outside. Without making a sound, people were secretly sent to investigate. It was later found that the source of the counterfeit bonds came from the China Printing Company, which printed the real bonds. Personnel were immediately sent to the police to surround and search the company at Gongri Gate in the city. The company's manager, He Naihui, and the toolmaker, Lu Mianchu, were detained and taken to the Finance Department for strict interrogation. At the same time, the four supervisors who were sent out that day, Tao Houpei, Zhai Lan, Ke Lihui, Zhong and He Shiqing, were also detained and questioned. According to the Finance Department, the printing company had three suspicious points: (1) The seal of the Finance Department's supervisor on July 6 was still wet on July 15th at noon. (2) Multiple books of intact counterfeit bonds were found in the company's warehouse, and their numbers were not far from the numbers of the counterfeit bonds in circulation. (3) The company's printing plates were inspected, and the 100-yuan and 50-yuan plates were missing. Based on the above suspicious points, the Finance Department sent its staff Li Deyu, Lin Shuwen, Liang Qingzhu, Zhao Leifu, and Li Weizhi, along with four special agents and several policemen from the Chentang Branch, to seal the printing factory at 1:00 pm on the 16th. The criminals will also be convicted during the day. As for the number of counterfeit bonds that have been sold on the market, the exact number is still unknown to the outside world. (July 17)</p>

<p>Shenyang Correspondence: Panchen Erdeni, the Great Master of Protector of the Nation and Spreader of Wisdom, arrived in Tianjin from Beijing on the afternoon of the 17th after visiting Deputy Commander Zhang in Beijing to report on his experience in Beijing. Then, on the afternoon of the 19th, he left Tianjin for Liaoning. At about 1:00 pm on the 20th, he arrived at the Huangguantun Railway Station in Shenyang. The welcoming personnel from various agencies and groups in the provincial capital included Yuan Qing'en, Director of the Mongolian Banner Office of the Political Committee; Yang Zhengzhi, Director of the Deputy Officer's Office of the Border Administration; Li Shaobai, Director of the Panchen Reception Office; Bian Zongmeng, Principal of the Mongolian Banner Normal School; Mongolian Banner Office staff, Mongolian Prince Darhan Wang; and lamas from the east, west, south, and north pagodas of the Huang Temple.

<h3 id="e68">Liaoning Province's Plan for the Reform of Police Administration <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>▲Division into Twelve Public Security Zones</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: Huang Xiansheng, the director of the Liaoning Provincial Police Department, has been determined to rectify the police administration of the entire province since taking office. Recently, after following Deputy Commander Zhang to Beijing, he took the opportunity to inspect the police administration in various places. He felt that the police administration in the capital was the most complete, so he expressed to people that Liaoning Province, which connects the north and south, should emulate the capital for rectification. He immediately drafted a reform plan, submitted it to Deputy Commander Zhang in Beijing for approval, and then started with zoning after returning to Liaoning. The entire province was divided into twelve public security zones, and a captain was assigned to each public security zone to command it. Liaoning Province has a total of 104 public security infantry companies, with 10,606 police officers; 66 cavalry companies, with 3,113 police officers; 20 artillery companies, with 1,568 police officers; 21 independent cavalry platoons, with 514 police officers; and 34 independent artillery platoons, with 1,354 police officers. In total, there are 27,157 police officers. Depending on the complexity of the affairs in each district, the above number of police officers will be allocated in appropriate proportions. The drafted plan has been submitted to the provincial government for review and approval. Chairman Zang Shiyi considered the proposed plan to be well-considered, but since it involved changes to the public security team system, it must be sent to Chen Wenxue, the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, for review and then ordered to be implemented to show prudence. It has already been submitted to the Department for review yesterday. The content of the zoning plan proposed by the Provincial Police Department is recorded below. The first zone (Shenyang, Liaoyang, Liaozhong, Fushun, Benxi) is commanded by Zhang Fengxi, with eleven infantry companies, three cavalry companies, two artillery companies, one independent cavalry platoon, and two independent artillery platoons. The second zone (Heishan, Beizhen, Panshan, Tai'an) is commanded by Liu Weihan, with five infantry companies, three cavalry companies, one artillery company, two independent cavalry platoons, and three independent artillery platoons. The third zone (Jin County, Suizhong, Xingcheng, Jinxi, Yixian) is commanded by Gong Wenchao, with nine infantry companies, three cavalry companies, one artillery company, two independent cavalry platoons, and four independent artillery platoons. The fourth zone (Gaiping, Haicheng, Yingkou, Fuxian) is commanded by Zhou Yuwen, with eight infantry companies, two cavalry companies, one artillery company, one independent cavalry platoon, and three independent artillery platoons. The fifth zone (Fengcheng, Andong, Xiuyan, Zhuanghe, Kuandian) is commanded by Zhang Yishan, with ten infantry companies, no cavalry companies, one artillery company, two independent cavalry platoons, and four independent artillery platoons. The sixth zone (Huanren, Xinbin, Jian, Tonghua) is commanded by Zhang Zongzhou, with thirteen infantry companies, one cavalry company, three artillery companies, two independent cavalry platoons, and one independent artillery platoon. The seventh zone (Tieling, Qingyuan, Kaiyuan, Xi'an) is commanded by Yao Jiayu, with sixteen infantry companies, four cavalry companies, three artillery companies, two independent cavalry platoons, and two independent artillery platoons.

<h3 id="e69">Recent News on the Xu Min Dyke Protection Case <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>▲Provincial Government Sends Personnel to Xuzhou for Investigation</p>
<p>▲The People Propose Three Measures</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: After the Xu Bu dyke protection incident occurred, the local communities held a meeting on the aftermath of the June 30th Massacre to reach a temporary solution. After the case was reported to the provincial government, the provincial office sent Fu Zhiren to Xuzhou for investigation. The people living on the former Yellow River dyke heard the news and gathered in a team on the afternoon of the 22nd to petition Fu, with about two to three hundred people. The flags were marked as the Yuanqiao Township People's Dyke Protection Petition Group. The group members each held a small flag. Hu Rongqing, who died in the case, his sons Hu Zhensheng, Hu Desheng, Hu Xiaosan, and their families also participated in mourning clothes. The representatives Liu Gongchen and Shufan presented three conditions to Fu: (1) Jiudetang illegally bought more than twelve hectares of official dykes. Please cancel the contract for Jiudetang to buy the dyke and investigate the person in charge of Jiudetang. (2) Zuo Shuyi, the Director of the Bureau of Official Assets, colluded with Jiudetang and caused the tragedy. Please dismiss and punish him. (3) Yang Wei, the magistrate of Tongshan County, did not investigate the facts, arrested the people and imprisoned them, and opened fire to injure people. Please investigate him. Fu replied that he had investigated all parties, and expressed the following regarding the three matters requested by the people: (1) Jiudetang did have a license issued by the Ministry of Finance, but did not have a license issued by the county government, which is suspicious. The circumference of the city has a high embankment of more than twelve hectares, and the price for each acre is one yuan and five jiao, totaling more than one thousand eight hundred yuan. The sale of official assets in various places has never been so cheap, which is the second suspicious point. Jiudetang undertook the work during the tenure of Li Enbao, the former director of the Bureau of Official Assets, and the documents were vague and unclear, with no boundaries in all directions, which is the third suspicious point. This will have to wait for the county government to investigate and deal with it. (2) The truth about the case handled by the current Director of the Bureau of Official Assets, Zuo Shuyi, has been investigated and will be dealt with appropriately after being reported to the province. (3) The county government should not have beaten the people to death, which has also been investigated, but the county government also has a corresponding theory, which also needs to be reported to the province for review and approval. Finally, the people asked the province to distinguish between priorities and allow the people to undertake the official dyke according to Jiudetang's purchase price, and hand over the documents and photos to be submitted to the province. Only then did they disperse. (July 22)</p>

<p>▲Discussion of the Construction Plan for the 20th Year</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department, with the commencement of the 20th year, urgently needs to determine its construction policy for implementation. In the past, construction project plans in various counties were based on the county as a unit. Due to differing levels of affluence and varied terrains, all construction projects often lacked mutual coordination and adjustment, hindering overall development. Therefore, construction officials from various counties are being summoned in batches to the provincial capital for meetings to discuss everything. In addition to the mandatory attendance of one secretary from the Construction Department, the chief of the First Section, and the chief of the Second Section, directors of construction bureaus and technicians from construction offices in each county should attend the meetings in batches according to the scheduled dates. The scope of the meeting includes: 1. Construction officials from each county reporting on the work done in the previous year, achievements in recruiting labor for road construction, the status of bridges, culverts, and road surface progress; 2. Reporting and discussing various construction project plans for the current year, discussing methods for organizing the various construction-related economic incomes of each county, reporting on the types of construction taxes and levies, the actual amount collected compared to the targeted amount, and the amount of funds held and accumulated by the construction bureaus of each county; 3. Reporting on the budget for construction expenditures in each county for the current year and the administrative status. Matters concerning water conservancy, highways, and electricity can be addressed by having the chairman request the director of the department to temporarily designate the responsible personnel for those matters to attend. All proposals, after being approved by the attendees, will be submitted to the department for adoption and implementation. The meeting dates are from August 5th to August 25th, with meetings held in batches.</p>

<p>Pseudo-Group etc. Escorting Song Xun to be Tried - Zhang Tongsheng, the pseudo-leader of the Lake Bandit Taibao A Shu's group, nicknamed Gaojiao Pai Siquan, has been captured by the water police in Wuxi. After obtaining a confession, a squad of police officers was dispatched today (the 24th) to escort the bandits Zhang Tongsheng and Miao Aye to Songjiang for trial by the bandit suppression headquarters.

<p>Strictly Prohibit Fraud in Purchasing Cotton on Credit - Some citizens, including Cai Jinxiu, have stated that it is a custom in the countryside of this county that every autumn harvest, some people purchase cotton from farmers on credit, promising payment later. People often trust these verbal agreements, and there are no written contracts. As a result, some unscrupulous individuals take the cotton but do not pay promptly, delaying payment and even resorting to lawsuits. Judges often rule against the creditors because they have no evidence, and farmers suffer greatly. The autumn harvest is approaching, and it is important to take preventive measures. Therefore, a petition has been submitted to the county government requesting a prohibition, and the county government has issued a notice to all farmers, urging them to carefully consider and demand written contracts when selling cotton on credit, to avoid losses.</p>

<p>▲ Special Reinforcements: Liang Guoquan, Chen Quandai, Chen Jinpei, Li Chengyuan, Li Mulong, Ye Guihong, Zhang Yunqi, etc. all have considerable strength. If they can step forward, there will be good results. It is also hoped that Xu Yaotang, Zhu Wenlin, Zhang Zhiying, Le Bingquan, etc. will also be present to prepare. If all goes well, there will be suitable candidates for the 100-yard backstroke, 200-yard freestyle, 880-yard freestyle, 100-yard breaststroke, and 200-yard medley relay, and we will not be too far behind.</p>
<p>▲ Breaking Shanghai Records: In the past two days, during practice and preliminaries at the Western YMCA, Yin Yanjun achieved 29 seconds in the 50-yard freestyle and 1 minute 10 seconds in the 100-yard freestyle. Yu Binqi achieved 1 minute 30 seconds in the 100-yard backstroke and 2 minutes 15 seconds in the 200-yard freestyle, all breaking the highest Shanghai records.</p>
<p>▲ List of Tournament Officials: Shen Siliang is the Chief Referee, Mr. Hower is the Starter, Qian Yiqin and Yao Shui are the Referees, Ling Xitao and Chen Zhang'e are the Timekeepers, and the Secretaries are Tuo Ping, Zhou Jiaqi, and Chen Yuze.</p>
<p>▲ Women's Association to Observe: The Shanghai Women's Swimming Association, in order to broaden swimming skills and study learning methods, selected Ms. Zhang Guiqing, Gao Junzhu, Li Weilun, Song Shujia, and Zhang Meiqing through the votes of Mr. Yu Binqi of the association to observe the Sino-American-Japanese triangular swimming competition tonight to supplement guidance methods.</p>
<p>▲ Yu Binqi's Statement: This first triangular swimming competition was initiated by the Western YMCA. The representatives at the meeting decided that each ticket would cost one yuan to subsidize the expenses of the Western Sea. For example, nine medals per item would be exchanged for water and other miscellaneous expenses. Our country did not receive any money. China's participation this time is entirely for research purposes, and to show that our country also has a swimming team organization. It is necessary to gather talents and sell them for resistance, or it will not be able to resist later. Therefore, it is necessary to organize a special team. It is not that Binqi wants fame. Today, I hope that reinforcements will attend, so that they can practice and help in the future to attend the National Games. It is also heard that the person with the most points will be awarded a silver shield by the Shanghai Standard Sports Equipment Company.</p>
<h3 id="e99">The Superior Basketball Skills of Zhonghua Basketball Team Triumph Over Shangda <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>| Thirty-Two to Twenty Points |</p>
<p>▲ Tonight, Shangda Battles Hujiang Middle School Affiliated High School</p>
<p>▲ Shangda's Final Battle in Shanghai</p>
<p>Last night, the basketball team of Chih Chi University defeated the basketball team of Japanese Shangda University by thirty-two to twenty points at the Zhonghua Basketball Team. The audience was the largest in recent days, admiring the deep cultivation of Chih Chi's basketball skills. This was Shangda's fifth defeat.</p>
<p>▲ Strong Resistance: At the beginning of the game, Shangda resisted strongly. After Kong Guangyi scored the first point, the score difference was only one or two points, and there were two ties at five to five and eight to eight. Shangda relied on its rapid passing and often launched attacks. Chih Chi roared, and the whole army advanced fiercely, quickly achieving a great advantage of fifteen to nine, winning the first half with fifteen to eleven.</p>
<p>▲ Smooth Operation: In the second half, Chih Chi gradually became more skilled, and the operation was smooth and unobstructed. They scored eight points in one go, creating a score of twenty to twelve. Seeing the fierce momentum, Shangda defended carefully and adjusted its troops from time to time. Chih Chi's score generally exceeded by seven or eight points. When it reached twenty-five to seventeen, Yang Zhongjiang suddenly withdrew due to four fouls. The military appearance did not move slightly because of this. Qian and Kong, the two forwards, coordinated with each other, winning a big victory of twenty-eight to eighteen, with great cheers. In the end, they won thirty-two to twenty.</p>
<p>▲ Not Yet Satisfied: With Chih Chi's basketball skills, they should have defeated Shangda severely. Yesterday's winning points were still not enough to satisfy our expectations. The reason is that they have not been familiar with the ball for many days, resulting in the loss of many hittable balls. However, the agility of Yang and Qian, the two forwards, and the bravery and composure of Kong, the forward, are still undiminished. For Shangda, Nagai and Kaneko are worth watching.</p>
<p>▲ Shanghai Team to Battle: Today, the Hujiang Middle School Affiliated High School, which dominates the sea, will battle Shangda and should be able to win. The game will still be at the basketball hall at 8 PM. This is Shangda's last battle in Shanghai.</p>

<p>▲ The Subject of the Lecture is Anthropometry</p>
<p>Mr. Jiang Xiangqing has been hired by the Jiangsu Provincial Public Sports Field Service Personnel Summer Training Course and will take a special express train to Zhenjiang this morning to give a short lecture, and will return to Shanghai around the fourth or fifth of next month. The subject of the lecture is anthropometry. Mr. Jiang has a great research on this subject. It is heard that his lecture notes have been pre-ordered by the Benbu Qinfen Bookstore and obtained its copyright, which can be published by the end of September at the latest. It is found that there are few publications in the sports field in our country, and there are even fewer works on sports academic research. The book on anthropometry is even more unprecedented. Mr. Jiang's creation can be said to be the beginning. The association was founded by the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education. The students are all guaranteed by the Education Bureaus of each county, with a limit of two people per county. There are more than forty counties that have registered. The lecture period is four weeks, and the lecturers hired are all well-known people in the sports field.</p>

<p>(2) Second Game Six to One</p>
<p>| The Army Retreats Three Times |</p>
<p>This game was even more intense than the previous one, and the most outstanding player was Gao Shannu, and all the players also performed to the fullest. The Army team had the advantage of choosing the gate first. The Southern Tour team kicked off the game and immediately launched an attack. The shooters tried repeatedly, and the Army team tried their best to save, unable to prevent it for a while, but Gao Shannu finally opened the scoring first. After the killing spree began, Gao Shannu became even more fierce, commanding the entire army, going to the front line again, and continuing to shoot two goals. However, Ji Chen was unwilling to show weakness and finally scored a goal, and then ended the first half. In the afternoon game, Chen Jiaqiu first set a record, followed by Sun Jinshun, and then Gao Shannu again, while the Army team remained the same. The Southern Tour team won again six to one.</p>
<p>After the end of the game, the Chinese Association, represented by Chairman Huang Guangtian, presented the Army teams with two silver cups and silver spoons as souvenirs. It was already dusk.</p>

<p>▲ The Railway Bureau Finds Ways to Repair</p>
<p>▲ About 300 kilometers of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, between Hepingmen and Yaohuamen stations, was hit by torrential rain and flash floods at about 5:00 PM yesterday. The station platforms were flooded with water, and the tracks were submerged deeply. When the locomotive passed, the train body was submerged. The downward fourth special express train arrived at the place and could not move forward, so it returned to Hepingmen station. The Public Works Department has set about investigating whether the roadbed has been damaged. Therefore, the fourth Beijing-Shanghai special express train, the twenty-sixth Beijing-Xishuangbanna passenger train, the sixth night train, and the night freight train were all suspended temporarily. After the repairs are completed, if there is no heavy rain today, it can be open to traffic within one or two days.</p>
<p>▲ The mountain cave on the east side of Zhenjiang Station was also flooded with water, and the soil on the mountain loosened and fell, so that each train could not move forward. A telegram has been sent to the Zhenjiang Engineering Office to find ways to repair it.</p>

<p>▲ Merchants Arrive at the Meeting to Request Registration</p>
<p>▲ Chinese Merchant Ships Have Stopped Loading Yesterday</p>
<p>The Anti-Japanese Aid Overseas Chinese Association's boycott of Japanese goods movement has gradually seen results after days of active work. The merchants who purchased goods before the 14th have come to the Anti-Japanese Association one after another to receive the form for registration. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Busy Registration Work Yesterday, the merchants who came to the Anti-Japanese Association to request to receive the form for registration included Yuxing Yarn Shop, Dalu Sock Factory and Huayang Department Store, Jiangsu Match United Association, Brothers Store, Rongchangxiang Foreign Goods Store, Yuanli Cotton Cloth Shop, Jiangnan Paper Mill, Xiangda Foreign Goods Shop, Yifeng Yarn Shop, Zida Cotton Cloth Shop, Taimao Lumber, Hongzhang Textile Yarn Shop, Yongkang Guanghuo Shop, Yuxin Yarn Shop, Daxiang Silk Shop, Yongtaixiang Guanghuo Shop, Huiwentang Printing Bureau, Yuanxiang Hardware Shop, Dechangxiang Guanghuo Shop, Defeng Changlongji Foreign Cloth Shop, Yingfeng Huahang, Dacheng Foreign Goods Shop, Xiedaxiang Foreign Goods Shop, Shunji Foreign Goods Shop, Yutai Paper Shop, Xinrenji Construction Factory, Yexinji Porcelain Cloth Shop, Sanliu Cloth Factory, Yuelai Company, Wei Guozhen, Central Trust Company, Yuchang Steel Essence Factory, Yida Yarn Shop, Jiuji Lumber Company, Yongxin Cloth Factory, Fengtaichang Foreign Goods, Yiyuxing Foreign Goods, Huanan Department Store, Maosheng Yarn Factory, Jin Faxiang Department Store, Tiansheng Yarn Shop, Huada Cloth Factory, Zhonghe Socks, Shixing Cloth Shop, Dafeng Shop, Xintai Cigarette Paper, Tianchengchang Porcelain, Xiangmao South Branch, West Branch, General Branch, Xiacheng Foreign Goods, Shunli Lumber, Gao Baoji Yarn Shop, Shenkang Lumber, Ren Fengji Lumber, Rongxing Yarn Shop, Chen Zhangji Plank Lumber, Qianchang Leather Shop, Yongyu Foreign Goods Shop, Science Instrument Museum, Xiachengxiang, Xiehexing, Dabe Industrial Society, etc., more than 100 companies. Therefore, the registration department's work is extremely busy.</p>
<p>▲ Japanese Goods Arrive Early Shanghai merchants pre-ordered 34,000 pieces of foreign cloth cotton yarn from Japanese merchants. Japan Post increased the number of ships to four to transport the goods scheduled for August in advance. The Tai'an Maru, Yamashiro Maru, and other ships swept the goods from Osaka and Kobe. Yesterday, it was confirmed that the goods had arrived in Shanghai, and it was heard that most of them were purchased by the Changjiang Gang. Japanese merchants are now planning to transfer the goods to Hankou and Yichang.</p>
<p>▲ River Ships Stop Loading Japanese Goods The Anti-Japanese Aid Overseas Chinese Association started inspecting Japanese goods yesterday. Therefore, the Donghuo loaded on the six company river ships a few days ago was very crowded. The day before yesterday was the last day before the inspection. All the Hakka people had to rush out, so the river ships were loaded even more. As of yesterday, the Japanese goods loaded on each river ship were greatly reduced. Chinese merchant ships have begun to refuse to load Japanese goods. British and American river ships do not dare to carry them either. However, Japanese ships still collect and transport goods declared by each Japanese firm. Chinese goods have completely stopped loading on Japanese ships.</p>
<p>▲ Japanese Goods Seized Again Yesterday the Anti-Japanese Aid Overseas Chinese Association seized a large number of Japanese goods at the South Railway Station. Yesterday, they received a secret report stating that a large batch of Japanese cloth would be loaded onto the ship today and transported to the Yangtze River. Therefore, they ordered the inspectors to pay attention. Yesterday afternoon, at the Hongsheng Wharf, two small lighters were found, fully loaded with Dongyang cloth, a total of more than 130 pieces, worth more than 80,000 yuan. After the inspectors interrogated the boatman, they learned that it was declared for export on the Xinningxing Ship, and it was immediately detained. The two ships of goods were escorted by the lighter and driven away from the wharf to report to the General Assembly and ask for instructions on how to deal with it. After the goods were detained, the carrying declaration firm stated to the General Assembly that the goods were declared within the period allowed for export by the General Assembly, and were originally intended to be shipped on the 23rd, but there was no cabin space on each river ship, and they were declared during the allowed transportation period, which is not comparable to those who violate the prohibition order. The General Assembly should forgive the original intention and give it convenience. I don't know if it can be allowed.</p>
<p>▲ The Fish Industry Association Boycotts Goods The Shanghai Fresh Fish, Salted Fish, and Cured Meat Industry Association recently held a joint meeting and decided that from now on, they will unanimously not import Japanese goods, and each industry will organize an economic severance committee to actively handle the boycott of goods movement, and issue a notice to be sent to all stores of the same industry for implementation, and it was also resolved that non-industry cargo customers who privately trade and transport goods to various ports, once found out, all stores of the three industries will permanently sever ties with the customer.</p>
<p>▲ Wuxi Chamber of Commerce Telegram The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce received a telegram from the Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce yesterday, saying that Japanese goods in the interior of Jiangsu Province are all imported from Shanghai. If Shanghai can investigate and deduct and eliminate them all, there will be no problems in the interior. The Association should lead the active implementation of this to avoid the import of Japanese goods, which will be of great benefit to the preservation of inland commerce. In addition to the relations with Japan, and actively soliciting aid for overseas Chinese, a separate announcement will be made to all industries. Still awaiting instructions, Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>▲ The Export of Canned Sugar Has Increased Greatly After the 24th, the transportation of Dongyang sugar has stopped at each port along the Yangtze River. Each port along the Yangtze River has unanimously switched to buying Hong Kong canned sugar. Yesterday, the first batch of Taikoo canned sugar was transported to Hankou, a total of 6,060 bags, transported by the Huangpu Ship. The Gonghe Ship of Jardine Matheson also transported 3,800 bags.</p>

<p>▲主席报告 主席团公推王晓籁报告开会主旨，大致说，今日临时会员大会，因为自全韩发生排华惨剧后，由上海各界代表大会决议，组织反日援侨委员会，本会也参加工作。但反日援侨，与商界有切肤的关系，因此经常务会议提出由执行委员会决议，商人应该自动奋起，一致对日经济绝交，特召集临时大会，共商反日援侨两种工作，能得到圆满结果。商人同具爱国热忱，应该牺牲处，应当忍痛牺牲，使其持久有效，详细办法，愿意共同讨论。</p>
<p>▲虞氏演辞 虞洽卿起立演说，</p>
<p>大致说，此次抵制日货运动发生后，日纱涨四十两，中国纱涨三四两，各地客商纷纷装运日货，使日货存积者，为之一空，轮船装运，几乎不暇供给，这是由于一般人民，口言爱国，心想发财的缘故。本人认为此次对日经济绝交，是因国家存亡关系，既然属于商人自动自决，即应激发天良，各自努力，务达抵制日货的最后目的云云。</p>
<p>▲讨论各案 主案报告后，即开始讨论。（一）驳运船业同业公会提议，应请大会责成驳运船业同业公会，通告全体会员，随时加以检查案。（二）海味杂货业同业公会提议，抵制日货，以稽查为最难，应请由各业举一识货熟手，组织审查委员会，以免纠纷案。决议，一二两项，并案办理。（一）组织日货检查委员会，由各业推员组织。（二）函复驳船业，拒绝装运日货，并予反日会以合法的便利。（三）棉布业同业公会提议，本埠日厂所制棉布，应请转函反日会，准予照旧通行案。（四）丝光棉织业同业公会提议，对日经济绝交中，应请注意工人生活酌用日纱案。（五）针织业同学业公会提议，国产双股线不敷应用，请妥议善法案。决议，三四五三项，并案办理，根据（一）奢侈品，（二）制成品，（三）必需品，（四）原料，四种原则组织抵制日货研究委员会处理。（六）丝线业同业公会，陈述对日经济绝交意见案。（甲）阅本月十六日大会宣言内开，凡本月十四日进货即须处罚一点，按诸国家法令，应自公布日施行，则十六日以前，商人并未知悉，各同业公会也未奉贵会知照，如何遵行，于法于理，均感窒碍。决议，（子）本月十四号以前被扣货物，由商会请反日会发还。（丑）由各业自动向商会登记后发售，未登记者商会不负责。（寅）登记自本日起，限期二星期。（乙）阅本月二十日报道，反日援侨会公告第二号处置办法。（甲）已定日货者从速退货，设对方不允，如何办理。（乙）（丙）两项，如商号已付守洋者，其损失归何人负担，至于（甲乙丙）三项，设将来发生法律上违约责任归何人担负。决议，交抵制日货研究委员会办理。（丙）用人宜慎重。（丁）办法宜周密。（戊）检查日货或调查日货时，应令货主将货名成色数目，开具详细，点交扣留，点交保管，点交发还，节节缜密，层层负责，审定是否日货，确定扣留放行及详细货物数量，登报披露，决议通过。（八）陆祺生建议，息争御侮四项案，原案计划，为（一）永息内争，（二）防止外侮，（三）地方自卫，（四）尚武精神。决议，登报宣言，通电全国，一致对日。</p>
<p>▲临时提议 （甲）郑缄三提议，前反日会详细账目，应立即公布案。决议 （一）由市商会函反日援侨会转前反日会公布详细账目。（二）组织审查委员会，推举叶容兴、马少荃、陈松源、项松茂、王廉芳、谢仲洛、邵宝兴、郑缄三、郑澄清九人为委员。（乙）虞洽卿提，现在所用的煤，多为日货，国煤不敷应用，应如何办理案。决议，交日货研究委员会办理。（丙）组织筹募救济金分组案。决议，由各业公会，分组办理。议毕，散会。</p>
<p>▲通告各业 该会经临时会员大会决议，自动登记日货后，即发通告说，直接禀告各位，我方已查明此次对日经济绝交，应由商界自动组织，业经本会通电各商会，请他们一致进行，原电已刊登在本市各报纸上，已邀大家阅览，本市为全国所关注，更应首先倡导，以符合自动组织的本旨。兹经本月二十四日本会临时会员大会决议，即日起办理日货登记，凡各公司商号，所进日货，在七月十三日以前的，统应于八月六日以前，自动来本会登记，以便转至反日援侨会，按照将来约定的办法，准许其发卖，所需登记表格，需用者可随时向本会商务科索取，如关于表式填写，有不明白的地方，也可赴该科接洽询问。各商店应知此次对日经济绝交，实为民族争存的最后一道防线，如果从前几次，均能各竭尽血诚，认真办理，那野心家也当稍有顾忌，何至国际惨剧，继续屡次上演，是今日在韩八万华侨的死伤枕籍，流离失所，皆由我商界不能努力争存，以至于召来侮辱开启争端，且商民受辱，本不限于一地一事，如之前济南之役，类似事件皆是突然爆发，我民族不自强，则随时有被人宰割的忧虑，各商家勿以为经商国内，不难达到自身幸免的希望，惟有抱定共同奋斗的宗旨，完成商界的人格，如果迁延观望，竟不履行登记手续，届时如有发生被扣被罚情事，则公义所在，届时各商家，即使想要申诉，本会也难以办理，既失信誉，又遭损害，此中利害，不难两言而决，用特在此诚恳通告，务必望大家查办遵照办理为荷，再者，本会登记日货，与反日会登记日货，同属一事，惟为便利商民起见，故有此项规定办法，此层尤其须注意，专此布告，并颂公众安绥。</p>
<p>▲商会公告 该会又发布即日起开始日货登记公告说，兹经临时会员大会决议，为了实行商界自动对日经济绝交起见，自即日起，办理日货登记，凡本会商家，于七月十三日以前，进有日货者，应于八月六日以前，自动赴本会登记，以便将来按照规定办法，准许其售卖，登记表格，可来会向商务科索取，其填写格式，如未明了，也可向该科接洽询问，倘有未经登记的货，以致被扣被罚者，虽经来会申诉，本会也不便代为办理，务各注意为要，惟希公众鉴察。</p>
<h3 id="e111">各界反日运动 <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>▲全国商联会 全国商会联合会，昨天为了朝鲜人民仇杀华侨惨案，特开常委会议，到林康侯、苏民生、张棫泉、李奎安、陈日平彭础立、（陈之英代）卢广渍、（陆凤竹代）等，由林康侯主席，秘书顾怀冰纪录，行礼加仪，首先由主席致开会词，并静默三分钟，志哀，各委员讨论此项惨案均极其愤慨，当场决议由会通电全国各商会，劝导各界，本着良心的主张，拒绝使用日货，积极提倡国货。电文当日由会拟发，接着讨论其他对日问题后散会。</p>
<p>▲国货维持会 中华国货维持会常务委员汪星一、王介安，昨天电呈中央党部国民政府各机关说，（抬头略）东邻日本，虎视东亚，久怀吞并东三省等的野心，处心积虑，路人皆知。如今竟于万宝山事件，煽动朝鲜民众酿成暴动，残杀华侨，其幕后真相洞然，令人发指。查朝鲜本是我国藩属，以该国党祸，借口我国保护不力，引起甲午之役，遂其割取朝鲜的贪婪欲望。然而当年朝鲜的混乱不如今日之甚，且并未发生戕害日本民众之事，而日本人已肆意施展其泼辣手段。今风潮如此扩大，华人被害如此之重，日本政府既无节制及约束朝鲜民众的能力，也无保障及维护华侨的设施。我政府亟应提出重大抗议，（一）要求日本政府放弃对朝鲜的管辖权，既然其为独立国，一切境内政治法律税捐，由朝鲜人自理，不由日本人代为筹划。（一）在上述条件未成立以前，先由中日韩三国，订立平等商约，实行互惠。凡是华货日货运往朝鲜的，待遇一律，不得由日本一国</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>垄断。华货久销朝鲜，历史悠久。二十年来，被日本的重税所排斥，属会屡次收到旅韩侨商的声明，近十年来，受到进口苛税的重大束缚，仅就华绸方面来说，从前只征收货价百分之五的税，那时华货在朝鲜销路极盛。继后陆续加税，增至货价百分之三四十时，华绸仍有半数可以销售。民国十二年又加至货价百分之百，一百日绸运到韩国，仅征收货价百分之八的税，两相比较，何止天壤之别。最终导致每年销往朝鲜一千数百万金的华绸，从此绝迹。上年新订的中日协定，虽减少了百分之三十，然对改变时艰毫无补益，迄今依然寸货不能运往。故近来华商在朝鲜的商业，只能经营日货，情状实在可怜。今又狼心日甚，愈演愈烈，初则仇视华货，扼其咽喉，征以重税，使其不能进口，残害华侨的商业地位，无所不用其极。彼之封销政策，目的既达，近又仇视华民，挑拨朝鲜民众，大肆屠杀。我国若不提出严重要求，势将以道歉和抚恤金敷衍了事，还成什么国际社会？以治标而言，（一）我国政府应用相当方法，务使朝鲜的骚乱不再发生。（二）迅速运用外交政策，恢复在朝鲜的中国国权，使华侨在朝鲜得以永久的保障。（三）中央暗派大员周密调查被害伤民及财产损失，要求日本政府赔偿，以免调查时被日军警借口保护，实行包围。（四）重惩保护不力的日韩军警。以治本而言，（一）朝鲜恢复国权，订立中日韩通商平等条约，实行税率平等。凡是日货运往中国，华货运往日本，以及运入朝鲜境内的，彼此一律平等，实行互惠，悉照日货同等税率纳税征收，不得再将华货征收重税。盖此项约章，关系着华侨在朝鲜的生死存亡，故须提前要求订定。（二）东三省为我国领土，日本永远不得驻兵，并严厉要求撤退满铁沿线的驻军。（二）万宝山一案，关系尤其深切。凡是日韩人民，非有脱离本国国籍的确实证明，不得归化中国。既然入了华籍，日本当然不再干预。此次约中，自应妥善规定。凡此种种，是为了消除根本的大患，免除旧时藩属长期被压迫的局面，且以恢复华鲜的商业运输，于国际前途、实业前途，关系甚巨。属会在青天白日之下，素来仰赖政府以革命的精神，办理外交，一洗帝制腐化的劣败。不揣冒昧，谨本心理，缪贡刍荛。全国民众，愿为后盾。现届中日协定修约以前，大部分令饬属会会同有关系团体，共同研究，贡献出具体意见以备采择在案。除专案仍遵照办理外，并恳请钧部一并注意，合并陈明，云云。</p>
<p>▲闵行各界 上海县第一区闵行各界，昨天下午一时，召集全区各界代表大会，筹议切实对日办法，到商会、教育会、农会、各同业公会等十余团体，由常务沈景主席，决议立即成立反日援侨会，推举沈景、张景龄等十一人为委员。该会定今天起开始工作，对于往来船只，均须严密检查，各商店所存日货，须一律登记，停止发售，并严禁征收任何基金云。</p>
<h3 id="e112">刺宋案续讯 <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>▲嫌疑人简丹已释放</p>
<p>▲监察院秘书足骨炸断</p>
<p>▲军警机关保护北站</p>
<p>在北站谋刺财政部长宋子文案中，昨天军警机关及捕房方面，分头缉捕凶徒，尚无结果。至于前晨汇司捕房曾在浙江路安乐旅馆拘获嫌疑人广东人简丹一名，于当日下午，移交给警备司令部侦查队。昨天据本报记者调查，侦查队因简丹的口供，虽有不符之处，但证据不足，遂即时派侦查员至宋部长公馆，详细询问宋部长及卫士等，始悉凶徒均服白色短衫，内有一人穿长衫，并无穿军衣者在内，而简丹系穿军服，经审查结果，遂于前日下午六时，将简丹一名释放。</p>
<p>又受伤的卫士、路警及监察院秘书王士铎等十名，在医院疗治经过，均极其良好。本报记者昨天又往福民医院访问了医院秘书王士铎君，据王称，右足伤处已用手术，弹片已取出，但右足除大足趾外，其余四足趾的节骨均断裂，将来虽不至于残废，恐怕行走方面，定会有些许困难。医生说，约一个月左右，方可痊愈出院。今天（即昨日）极感痛苦，真所谓无妄之灾，言下不胜唏嘘。又说，当枪声响起时，我在宋部长一行人的前面，身已将出车站大门，及闻警后，同行乘客，都向大门乱窜，人众拥挤，更加无法前进，命令大家急忙伏地避弹，复遭炸弹波及，也真是不幸啊。我穿的皮鞋，若足皮鞋面已洞穿，想见爆炸之力云云。</p>
<p>淞沪警备司令部深觉北站为京沪沪杭交通要道，警卫力量薄弱，爰于昨日起，特派本部武装士兵一连，常驻车站，以资维护。</p>
<p>路局方面，除已严令各分段，加紧侦缉凶犯，务求破获惩办外，以为北站及南京下关等地，是京沪来往要冲，为惩前毖后起见，拟于北站三道出入口处，增设武装岗警，常驻守卫，并派警务稽查一人，轮流督率，且遇到京中各要人来往，更准时加派长警护卫，以昭慎密。兹录两路警务长邓祖禹呈文如下：敬呈者，本月二十三日上午七时十分钟，第六次列车到上海北站后，匪徒在站抛掷炸弹，伤害旅客的情形，已于当时呈报钧局备案。查本路路警仅有少数枪支，只供押车之用，各站岗警，只持警械，维持秩序。故两路路綫，均依赖宪兵及驻军保护，南京上海各大站检查行人，也由卫戍司令部·警备司令部及地方警察办理。如上海北站检查事宜，向由淞沪警备司令部办理。于本年七月二日，曾奉钧局第七六五号训令饬知，奉淞沪警备司令部令，车站检查处，已通令撤消，关于检查行人事宜，由公安局派警办理，本部派员督率等因，公安第五区同时在本站三道出入门口，均派有三四名警察检查行人，以防不测，日日如常，本极缜密。此历来的实在情形，早在钧长洞鉴之中。昨日事变突起，各人多走避不遑，路警为职责所在，虽无器械，也奋勇分头救护。宋部长也由京一分段警长赵忠心护送至钧局楼上，以避凶锋。此出事时的情形也。查上海北站与南京两站，时有要人往来，嗣后戒备，自当加严。警务长除令京七分段金警务长田对于南京站妥为防范，上海北站，拟在三道出入口门前，加设武装岗位，常驻守卫，请发给木壳枪十支，以便应用，并请派警务稽查一名，更番督率，以示严密。再各要人往返，请钧局转请先行电示，以便准时加派长警卫护，以昭慎重，警务长戒于既往、警于将来起见，除严令京一分段及各分段加紧侦缉，以期破获正凶，依法惩办外，谨呈鉴核。</p>

<p>▲Resumption of Navigation by Chinese Steamers on the Yangtze</p>
<p>Following a suspension of navigation by China Yangtze Steamship Company vessels since May 17th, lasting for two months, due to successive victories in the central government's bandit suppression campaign and a reduced need for over twenty ships for transport, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, seeking to resume steamer services on the Yangtze, dispatched Guo Waifeng to Nanchang to personally petition Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, requesting the return of leased vessels. Chiang granted permission and ordered the Communications Department to return the vessels of the China Merchants Sanbei Company to their respective bureaus to maintain transportation. The Jiang Da, Jiang Yu, and Jiang Xin, among other vessels, have been released to Shanghai in recent days, significantly increasing the number of Chinese steamer services, with two ships traveling between Shanghai and Hankou daily.</p>
<p>▲Full Resumption of Shipping in Shanghai Waters</p>
<p>Shipping between Shanghai and Haizhou had been disrupted due to a strike by stevedores at the docks, as well as a work stoppage by barge workers. Consequently, merchant vessels heading from Shanghai to Haizhou were obstructed at Dapu, completely halting the import and export of goods. Passenger and freight traffic from the Longhai Railway to Shanghai was also cut off. A large backlog of goods destined for Haizhou accumulated in Shanghai, and due to the ongoing boycott, there was a rush to transport Japanese goods, causing significant losses to local merchants during the week-long strike. Yesterday, a telegram arrived from Haizhou stating that the stevedores and barge workers had fully resumed work, and the obstructed vessels were unloading cargo. Shanghai was urged to expedite the transport of the accumulated goods to Haizhou.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Yesterday's Memorial for the First Anniversary of Zhao Tieqiao's Death <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>▲Public Memorial by Employees</p>
<p>▲Unveiling of Bronze Statue</p>
<p>Yesterday marked the first anniversary of the death of the late Commissioner Zhao Tieqiao of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. Employees of the company, recognizing Zhao's loyalty and dedication to the country during his lifetime, as well as his significant contributions to reorganizing the company, deeply mourned his untimely assassination. To commemorate his merits, a memorial ceremony was held at 9:00 AM yesterday at the Building No. 7 1/2 on the Bund. Attendees included Mayor Zhang, former Secretary-General Xu of the Supervisory Department of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Zhou Baoli representing the Garrison Headquarters, Yuan Ludeng, Wang Bofen, and Chen Ganqing representing the Shipping Industry Association, as well as Zhao's friends Yu Huancheng, Xu Xiuzhi, Hong En, Huang Douyin, Qin Daishi, Hong Yanbin, and over four hundred others, all of whom braved the rain to attend. The Municipal Police Bureau also sent a full military band to provide music. At 9:00 AM, company employee Wang Renjing was elected chairman and reported on the statue's construction and the significance of the memorial. Commissioner Guo Waifeng then held the unveiling ceremony for the bronze statue, followed by a public memorial by company employees and the 18th branch of the Kuomintang's Third District in Shanghai. Mayor Zhang delivered a speech, stating that Commissioner Zhao's revolutionary spirit served as a model for comrades and discussed the issues of providing for his family and giving him a public burial, which should be jointly undertaken by colleagues. Yu Huancheng spoke about Zhao's lifelong dedication to the revolution, his character in breaking through constraints, and his plans to reorganize the company. Hong Yanbin then proposed three points: (1) request a public burial from the National Government; (2) request that the court investigate and announce the truth about the murderer(s) and pursue the mastermind(s); and (3) request the National Government and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to issue full pensions. All were in agreement. Finally, a representative of the family expressed gratitude, and a photograph was taken before the gathering dispersed. It is reported that Commissioner Guo of the company has decided to erect Zhao's bronze statue in the remaining space of the Yangjiadu warehouse and has designated July 24th as the company's permanent memorial day.</p>
<p>▲Memorial Oration by Employees</p>
<p>On this 24th day of July in the 20th year of the Republic of China, the staff of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, in a united memorial meeting, respectfully offer these flowers and wine to the image of the late commissioner, Zhao Tieqiao. The words read: Alas, the talented are envied by ghosts, and the rough jade is attacked by axes. Good cannot overcome evil. We have lost Commissioner Zhao. Recalling his life, a remarkable revolutionary, a youthful talent with fervent patriotism, he stirred up his sleeves in Chengdu, shedding hot blood, growing more resolute in defeat. He bid farewell to his hometown, traveling north to Yanjing, advocating alliance, and promoting northern strength. The Party's prestige flourished, his name alongside Wang Jingwei and Huang Xing. He assisted Sun Yat-sen, a wise judge of men, entrusting him with important responsibilities, to oppose Yuan Shikai and protect the Constitution, participating in battles and responding to Wuchang and Chongqing, leading troops and strategizing. Through smoke and rain of bullets, he treated honors like floating clouds, with unyielding spirit and unwavering virtue. After the revolution's success and the establishment of the capital in Nanjing, he took charge of saving the situation and reforming the shipping administration, shouldering the responsibility with courage. He reformed the decaying, overcoming adversity and startling the wealthy and powerful into flight, eliminating abuses and restoring vitality. For three years he toiled, gathering public resentment, with rumors flying and impeachment accusations pouring in. Helplessly, the water cleared to reveal the stones. Why such cruelty? The treacherous plotters, a family exterminated with their roots cut. A rapid succession of attacks. Alas, Commissioner Zhao, a revolutionary for life, died not at the hands of the enemy, nor in battle, but was killed while working hard to build. He ultimately sacrificed himself for the country and achieved benevolence. All men must die, but his spirit will live on. Remembering his past virtue, his love for the masses, his sincerity, his protection of employees, his care for them as brothers. Recalling the tragedy, we are filled with grief. A year has passed, but the injustice remains unaddressed. Who killed this loyal man? Who masterminded this ghostly plot? Those vile criminals should be brought to justice. What more can be said if the ringleader escapes? May his spirit, so mighty, strip away their wicked souls. Alas, Commissioner Zhao, a hero in life, a martyr for the nation in death. For thousands of years, his glory will shine. The Yangtze flows on, the mountains of Sichuan stand tall. The cuckoo cries blood, summoning his sorrowful soul. Soul, oh soul, accept this libation. Alas, may you enjoy the offering. (The memorial oration from the 18th branch of the Kuomintang's Third District is omitted.)</p>
<p>▲Current Situation of His Family</p>
<p>Yesterday, Zhao's wife was unwell and temporarily asked her relative, Mr. Yang Yifu, to bring her five orphaned children, including Guangzu, to the scene. Afterwards, a reporter from the Huadong News Agency interviewed Mr. Yang about the recent situation of Zhao's family. According to Mr. Yang, Zhao's family has been facing hardship recently. During Commissioner Li's time, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company granted 3,000 yuan in pension, and during Commissioner Cai's time, they supplemented it to 5,000 taels. However, with a family of several relying on it for living expenses, coupled with the fact that Zhao had incurred many debts during his life, they have been struggling. The pension stipulated by the National Government has not been received either, making the future difficult. Zhao left behind eight orphaned children: Guangfu, Guangshi, Guangli, Guangzhen, Guangxiang, and two daughters, Xinglan and Yinhai, who are all young and unable to support themselves.

<h3 id="e120">Situation of Disaster Relief in Jiangxi <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Society for Raising Funds for Emergency Relief in Jiangxi received telegrams yesterday from disaster investigation officers Wei Keqiang and Wu Jiasan, addressed to Wang Yilao, Wen Lanlao, Wang Xiaolao, Chairman Wang, Xu Jinglao of the Jiangxi Emergency Relief Society, and members of the presidium. The telegrams stated that they had arrived in Ganzhou, met with Commander Xiong Shihui, and requested instructions on the relief approach. He indicated that three methods had been determined: (1) Emergency Relief: establishing shelters for women, children, and students; (2) Work Relief: dividing into four lines: Ganzhou to Xinggan, Xinggan to Lean and Ningdu, Linchuan to Ningdu, and Ji'an to Ningdu; (3) Agricultural Relief: establishing agricultural cooperatives and agricultural banks. Currently, there are approximately 200,000 disaster victims in Ganzhou and over 500,000 in Ji'an. The exact number in the bandit-controlled areas is unknown. The relief plan centers on establishing shelters in Ningdu. The organization of relief efforts will be designed by the local relief departments of the party and government committees, and Wei Keqiang and Wu Jiasan have been ordered to join the work. Those in Shanghai who have pledged but not yet paid should be urged to pay in treasury bonds. As per Commander Xiong's intentions, Wang Yilao and Wang Xiaolai should quickly sell these for cash, hopefully reaching one million. The remaining funds from the Jishui Society should also be pooled together for joint cooperation. The Jishui Society was originally scheduled to send one representative, and they should be urged to come to Jiangxi to assist in the relief efforts. Wei Keqiang and Wu Jiasan were ordered to go to Ganzhou and fear they are not up to the task, and they hope for constant instructions to avoid overstepping. The remaining words are confidential. Secretary Wei Keqiang and Advisor Wu Jiasan. Wang Yilao, Wang Xiaolao, Wen Lanlao, Chairman Wang, Xu Jinglao of Jiangxi Emergency Relief Society, Yan Zhilao, presidium members, and Economic Committee members Lin and Zhang were also addressed. The eight submitted proposals have been presented to Commander Xiong. Commander Xiong stated that work relief must begin first, so that the disaster victims can be accommodated and not just sit and eat. Agricultural banks should be established urgently so that farmers can borrow and rural areas can be easily restored. It is now waiting for the allocation of funds to start. The Commander has already telegraphed Yilao, and only 5-600,000 has been remitted to Ganzhou. It is proposed to allocate 300,000 as the foundation for the Agricultural Bank and 2-300,000 for work relief and road construction, and instructed Keqiang and Jiasan to telegraph to the members for their review. Secretary Wei Keqiang and Advisor Wu Jiasan.</p>

<h3 id="e123">Yesterday's Hearing of Li Hefei's Granddaughter's Property Division Case <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>▲Li Mu Gong's etc. Shares in Taiping Bank</p>
<p>▲Court Orders Temporary Prohibition of Transfer</p>
<p>▲Rent from Xian Yi Li Will Be Deposited in the Bank</p>
<p>Li Jia Zheng, granddaughter of Li Hefei, filed a suit with the Special District Court against her stepmother after leaving her husband, Zhang Jinjiang, due to irreconcilable differences. She demanded the return of 12,000 yuan in dowry money promised by her late father's will, as well as a savings book containing 645 yuan. The court has already ruled that the plaintiff must repay 12,000 yuan, as well as interest at a rate of one percent per annum from April of this year until the date of execution. She must also return to the plaintiff a Shen Fuzhuang Juji savings book containing 645 yuan. However, Li Jia Zheng also filed a suit requesting to divide her late father's inheritance with her uncle, Mu Gong, and her brother, Jia. The court has granted her request and sealed a portion of the property located on Xianyi Road, Chongqing Road, as an attachment. However, regarding the Taiping Bank shares, the court summoned relevant parties yesterday at the Special District Court's execution chamber. The general manager of Taiping Bank testified that Li Mu Gong and others had a total of 790 shares under their names, each share worth 100 yuan, totaling 79,000 yuan. However, as of July 21st of this year, Li Chengdetang (i.e., Li Feijun) owed 39,418 yuan. The plaintiff's attorney, Ge Zhaoji, stated that according to his information, the face value of each Taiping Bank share was 1,000 yuan. Now, the bank manager claims it is 100 yuan, which is a significant discrepancy that needs to be investigated. The court ordered that all transfers of the shares be temporarily prohibited, and that the matter be reviewed after the litigation is completed. When attaching the Xianyi Li property, most of the property was rented to tenants. To avoid disturbing the tenants, the doors were not sealed. However, regarding the collected rent, the defendant Li Jia's attorney suggested depositing it in the Guohua Bank for safekeeping, while the plaintiff's attorney preferred depositing it in the Shanghai Bank. This matter is still under discussion. As for Li Jia Zheng's personal divorce issue, it will likely be resolved after the property division case is settled.</p>

<p>▲To Be Reviewed After the Man and Woman Recover</p>
<p>Liu Tongdao, a 33-year-old street cleaner from Jiangbei, operates a boat for the French Concession Public Works Department, transporting garbage to a wasteland near Gaochangmiao for disposal. He lives with his family in a boat covered with straw mats by the Suzhou Creek. He married Liu Mao, the daughter of Mao Zhou, from his hometown last June 26. Mao, in her early twenties, is attractive but frivolous and immoral. Her husband, Liu Tongdao, recently discovered that she was having an affair with Chen Youcai, who works on a nearby boat. He warned her that if he caught her again, he would attack her with a kitchen knife. On the evening of the 22nd of this month, Liu suspected something when he did not see Chen go to work, and hired a replacement laborer. He rushed home but before entering, he heard lewd sounds from the room. Peeking through the door, he saw his wife naked with Chen Youcai in bed, making love. He was furious. He wanted to confront them but thought he was no match for them. He waited until 3:30 AM when they were asleep. He grabbed a kitchen knife and slashed them. Chen awoke in pain and grabbed the knife, throwing it in the river. A neighbor, Wang Xu, came to the scene and saw Chen and Mao naked, bleeding from the head. She told them to put on clothes. Mao Zhou, the woman's mother, heard the noise and arrived, advocating for a peaceful resolution without reporting to the authorities. Chen fled. At 8:30 AM, Liu surrendered himself to the Xinzha police station, stating the events. The police ordered his arrest and sent detective Shao Jingfan to investigate. No one was there. Chen Youcai was arrested on Wuzhen Road Bridge. Liu Mao surrendered and was sent to Kuangren Hospital for medical treatment. Both had minor injuries. Yesterday, the police sent Liu to the Second Criminal Court of the Special District Court. The police attorney, Wang Yaotang, stated the police are charging Liu with attempted murder under Article 284, paragraph 1, item 2 of the Criminal Code, and charging Chen Youcai and Liu Mao with adultery under Article 256 of the Criminal Code. Chen and Mao are in the hospital for treatment, so they were not present in court. Witness Wang Xu testified. The defendant confessed to knifing the adulterous couple. Judge Wu Tingqi ordered Liu Tongdao to post bail. He will be summoned when Chen Youcai and Liu Mao recover.</p>

The workers were overwhelmed with horror and immediately reported to the Russian supervisor, who immediately reported it to the Lujiiawan Central Police Station. Detectives rushed to the scene to investigate. Fortunately, it was discovered early and did not explode. The detectives took the bomb back to the police station for safekeeping and are investigating the source of the bomb to determine how it was hidden there.</p>

<p>▲Believes it Insults Women</p>
<p>▲Writes to Wu and Guo, Resigning as Judges</p>
<p>The National News Agency reported that the Shanghai Women's Relief Association held its seventh preparatory committee meeting yesterday.

After the chairman and various departments reported, the discussion began.

(2) The association will write a sister's letter. (3) Send a letter to the two Chinese female judges of the Beauty Pageant. (3) The City Representative Assembly resolved to establish the City Women's Relief Home, but this has not yet been implemented. Should it be urged? (Resolution)</p>
<p>Submit a request to the City Party Department to forward to the Municipal Government, and quickly establish the Shanghai Women's Relief Home in accordance with the City Representative Assembly's resolution. (4) The case of requesting the City Party Department to allocate preparatory funds: (Resolution) Push Wang Xiaoying and Lin Kecong to personally request the City Party Department again.

The text of the letter from the association to the Social Affairs Bureau and the letter to the two female judges Wu and Guo (the letter to the sisters is slightly longer, so it is omitted) are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>▲Letter to the Social Affairs Bureau: Regarding submitting a request to find a way to stop Chinese women from participating in the International Beauty Pageant in order to maintain social morality and respect women's personality, the International Beauty Pageant, nominally competing for beauty, is actually a disguised form of obscenity, using women's flesh for public appreciation, insulting personality like never before. Under our revolutionary government, how can we tolerate such shameless people acting recklessly? Moreover, this matter concerns social morality and the personality of the entire world. If we do not prohibit it, the danger of society's future will be even more unthinkable, and it will contradict the intentions of our leader's revolution. Therefore, we submit this document to request your bureau to find a way to stop Chinese women from participating in the meeting. We sincerely hope that you will review and implement it for the public convenience. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, Shanghai Women's Relief Association.</p>
<p>▲Letter to the Judges: It is said that people despise themselves before others despise them. Now is the time for the Party and the country to promote women's rights, and it is the time for our women to encourage and uplift themselves. Unless one is utterly foolish, one would never want to be the culprit. Only the insane would dare to harm the flock. This International Beauty Pageant uses women's flesh as a target for public appreciation, insulting women like never before. All our compatriots should rise up in opposition and unanimously condemn it. We have always admired your enthusiasm for society and your tireless efforts to protect your compatriots. We trust that you will put the honor and disgrace of all women first and hope that you will resign from your positions as judges of the Beauty Pageant as soon as possible, so as not to invite self-despisal and leave a shame on the women's community. This would be our greatest honor. Respectfully to Ms. Wu Ai Yun and Ms. Guo Anci, Shanghai Women's Relief Association.</p>

Recently, the Shanghai Public Security Bureau's Detective Team apprehended a bandit named Wang Desheng, who confessed to having an accomplice, Zhou Xiaowuzi, from Jiangbei, hiding at No. 1270 Robison Road in the western part of the Shanghai International Settlement. Consequently, Cao Junda, a detective from the Second District Public Security Bureau, reported this information to the Putu Road Police Station at 6:15 AM yesterday. Together with Chinese and foreign detectives, they arrested Zhou. He was immediately escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the Special District Court. Wang Yaotang, the police station's lawyer, presented the case, stating that although representatives from the Public Security Bureau were present, the official documents and all evidence were missing. He requested a postponement. A detective from the Public Security Bureau also submitted a report, requesting extradition and stating that the accomplice Wang Desheng had already been taken to Qingpu to pursue the remaining gang members, which is why the case file was not brought. The defendant claimed to be a rickshaw puller and denied any knowledge of the robbery and resistance. Judge Wu Tingqi reviewed the statements and ordered the defendant to be detained for further investigation once the Public Security Bureau provides the official documents and evidence.</p>

<p>Zhao Du's, a woman from No. 23 Shengzhi Lane, Zixia Road, Dadongmen, although aging, still retained her charm. She became acquainted with Zhao Qilang and Kong Chengrong from Haimen, leading to a jealous conflict. On June 14th, Kong Chengrong was lured to a railway siding in Xiaoshadu and murdered. He was stabbed multiple times, and his genitals were also cut off. The case was widely reported in the newspapers. Zhao Du's son, Zhao Jinrong, informed the police in a letter, leading to the arrest of Zhao Qilang and his accomplice Wang Cailang. They were sent to the District Court, where Prosecutor Yang charged them with murder. Yesterday, Judge Shen presided over the trial. Zhao Qilang testified that he was 34 years old, from Haimen, and lived on Zixia Road, working as a cook. He said that he divorced his wife, and he became intimate with Zhao Du's this January. In February, he was beaten out of her bed by her son, Zhao Jinrong. She then became intimate with Kong Chengrong. On June 14th, he did not call Kong to go out. The official asked if he told Zhao Du's that if asked too many questions, he would kill her along with her. He denied saying that. He also denied knowing Wang Cailang. Wang Cailang testified that he was 28 years old, from Haimen, lived at Haichao Temple, and worked as a cook. He denied knowing Zhao Qilang. He also denied knowing Wang Rongchun. The official asked if he had previously testified that Wang Rongchun told him that Wang, Zhang Zhaoshou, Huang Zhidao, Shi Shuangqing, and others committed the murder. He replied that he had not said that, and that Wang Rongchun only said that he was going to Xiaoshadu. Zhao Du's testified that she was 42 years old, from Changzhou, and that her husband died last June. Zhao Jinrong was her son from her late husband. She said that she became intimate with Zhao Qilang on January 20th, but her son chased him out on March 16th. Later, someone told her that Kong Chengrong had just died and that she could rely on him for the rest of her life, and they started a relationship in early April, staying at inns. On April 29th, she went to Kong's house on Miezuo Street, and Zhao Qilang also came, calling Kong to go to Xiaonanmen. She then went home. The next day, when he did not return, she went to find Zhao Qilang, but he was nowhere to be found. On May 2nd, she met him at Dadongmen, and he said that Kong had gone home. She followed him to look for him, but he said that he would go the next day, going out around 1:00. Unexpectedly, he left first. His landlord told her to go to Huiding Hospital, but she could not find him anywhere. She returned and grabbed Zhao at the Dafang Hotel. He threatened to kill her if she kept bothering him. Later, he told her that the police would be coming soon. After she returned home, she went to Kong's house, and his landlord told her that the newspapers reported that he was dead. Zhao Jinrong testified that he was 29 years old, from Shanghai, and worked in printing. Zhao Du's was his stepmother. After she was driven out for being intimate with Zhao Qilang, he did not know how Kong Chengrong was dating her, nor how he died. On May 5th, he reported the case in a letter because he was in danger. Kong Er'a testified that he was 41 years old, from Haiyan, and lived on Meibike Road. Kong Chengrong was his cousin. He said that he saw a report on the 16th about a male corpse being murdered in Xiaoshadu, and it looked similar to his cousin, so he went to inquire. Afterwards, he could not find Zhao Dalang. He then reported Zhao to First District Police. His wife claimed that Zhao Qilang was the one who murdered her husband. Zhang Zhu's testified that she was 41 years old, from Shanghai, and lived on Miezuo Street. Kong Chengrong was her tenant. She recognized Zhao Qilang because of a mole on his neck. After dinner on April 29, he and Kong Chengrong went out with another person, and he never returned. On the third day of the month, she saw the news report saying that he had been murdered.

Yesterday morning, around 10:30 AM, the siblings had an argument over a palm-leaf fan. Their mother scolded Mingrui for this, and the matter seemed to have subsided. However, Mingrui, overwhelmed with anger, went to the upper room and stabbed himself in the throat with scissors. His trachea was severed, and blood gushed out. He collapsed on the wooden floor. His mother heard the noise and went upstairs, witnessing the tragic scene. She was shocked speechless. After a while, she cried out to the staff to come. Mingrui was quickly sent to Tongren Hospital by streetcar for treatment.</p>

<p>On the 16th of this month, the Shanghai Public Security Bureau received a tip that someone was secretly operating a radio station inside No. 208 Barry Road, Rue Sapey, in the French Concession, with actual anti-government activities. The director of the bureau sent personnel to report the case to the French police station, and detectives were ordered to go to the address, arresting fourteen people from Shanxi Province, including Tian Yunshi, Tai Pinshan, Liu Wenlou, Li Ziyang, Wen Zhian, Jia Ting, Wang Yuqing, Tian Yutian, Guo Guien, Shen Xiangsheng, Shen Xiangyi, Kong Xiangeng, Liu Zijun, and Zhang Pu.

Then, a detective from the Public Security Bureau reported that the defendants were sent to Shanghai by Yan Xishan to commit subversive activities and requested permission to extradite them for trial. Defendant Liu Zijun, represented by lawyer Lin Yingqing, claimed that he worked for the Jinji Tobacco Company in Taiyuan and was mistakenly arrested while visiting friends. Tian Yunshi and others also said that they did not dare to disrupt public order and had not set up a radio station. The Chinese and Western judges ruled that the plaintiff's request for extradition could not be granted, and all defendants were released.</p>

<p>▲Truck Driver Sentenced to Three and a Half Years</p>
<p>▲Additional Fine of Five Thousand Yuan</p>
<p>Du Chaozhuan, a Tongzhou native working as a driver for Cai Guiji Trucking Company at No. 16 Yihe Lane, Huaji Road, was arrested on the 17th of this month at 1:40 AM while loading 24 bags of opium, weighing 2,088 pounds, at the Gonghexiang Wharf on Zhaofeng Road, for transportation elsewhere. He was stopped by Indian constables No. 617 and No. 644 from the Huishan Police Station. He failed to stop and an officer opened fire, wounding Du in the hand and killing Yu Jinsheng, a Wuxi native who was guarding the goods. It was revealed that a fugitive opium trafficker had bribed the two Indian constables ten dollars. Chinese detective Xu Yongyuan and Western detective Blake took Du and the opium to the Special District Court for questioning and detention. This was already detailed in the newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xiefen continued the hearing in the Third Court. The police station's lawyer, Li Zhishan, stated that the principal offenders and accomplices could not be apprehended during the postponement. However, the defendant driver had been driving the whole time. The position and bloodstains of the deceased Yu Jinsheng were not in the driver's area. The truck's gas tank was damaged by bullets, causing it to stop. Otherwise, the defendant would have continued to drive away. The deceased was a newly trained apprentice, who specialized in wandering around Huaji Road. Detective Xu stated that at the time, two ships were docked at the wharf, Fuxing and Guangyao Maru, but Fuxing was far from the wharf, while Guangyao Maru was much closer. He investigated the ship, and the crew members claimed they did not know anything. The defendant's testimony was the same as in the previous hearing. After reviewing the statements, Judge Xiao sentenced Du Chaozhuan to three years and six months in prison for aiding and abetting the transportation of opium, and imposed a fine of 5,000 yuan. If the fine is not paid after compulsory execution, it will be converted to imprisonment based on the total amount of the fine divided by the number of days in a year. The number of days spent in custody before the judgment is determined will be credited against the prison term at a rate of two days for each day of imprisonment. The 2,088 pounds of opium and the truck were confiscated. The ten dollars bribe was temporarily placed in storage.</p>

<h3 id="e143">Real Estate Association Notice: Renters Must Provide Bond <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Real Estate Association yesterday sent a letter to its members stating, "We are writing to inform you that the Youcheng Company leased a house at No. 401 Wuding Road to someone who turned out to be a kidnapper. Although a bond was obtained from the tenant at the time, it was returned to him after he moved out, according to customary practice. The court of first instance did not pay attention to this point and, at the request of the police lawyer, ordered the house to be confiscated. The party concerned refused to accept this and filed an appeal. At the request of the party concerned, the Association legally proved the matter to the court of second instance. The appellate court has now ruled that the house be returned. A copy of the judgment is enclosed for reference. From this case, it can be seen that landlords should obtain a bond from tenants as a matter of prudence. If there had been no bond obtained in this case, the landlord would have suffered the disaster of having his property confiscated, regardless of whether he was aware of the tenant's activities or not. This is a notice to be followed and obeyed."</p>

<h3 id="e146">Anhui Native Association Telegram Urges Emergency Relief for Floods <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>The Anhui Native Association sent a telegram to the central government, "To Chairman Jiang of the Nanjing National Government and Chairman Xu of the Relief Committee: We have received reports from various counties along the river and Huai River in this province. The sky has sent continuous rain, and the rivers Huai have flooded. Embankments have collapsed, and floods have overflowed. The wheat season was not fully harvested, and the autumn harvest is now hopeless. The disaster victims are more than tens of millions. In particular, the counties along the Huai River are most severely affected, more than three feet higher than the two major floods in Jiyou, 1929 and 1930. Huge waves were raging and the sky was boundless. Places like Fuyang, Huoqiu, Shouxian, Ying Shang, Woyang, Mengcheng, Taihe, Bo County, Wuhe, Huaiyuan, Dingyuan, Fengtai, Tianchang, Xuyi, Sixian, Su County, Lingbi, Fengyang, and Quanjiao were reported to have losses of 90 percent or more of houses and land and innumerable people drowned. The survivors climbed to the tops of trees and roofs, without food, and were swept away by the wind and waves, joining the sea. The bodies of people and animals floated down the river and could not be salvaged and buried. Farm implements and utensils were drifting in the water, and firewood, grass, and rice were all washed away. Even more than 300 refugees in Huoqiu, who were escaping the bandits, were washed away by the water overnight at Sanhe and their fate is unknown. A family of seven surnamed Cao in Fengtai knew there was no way to live, so they tied themselves together with ropes and went with the waves. Shouxian City was like the bottom of a pot, with water inundating the city walls, and the whole city was in danger of collapsing. Zhengyang, Huaiyuan, and other cities, and Bengbu, Linhuai, Luqiao, and Mingguang and all of the towns were submerged in water. Telephone poles were broken, ships were stopped, and transportation was cut off, and news was not coming. The tragic situation cannot be described. Even if the water recedes, the autumn planting will be delayed and homes will be destroyed, and there will be no way to live. Please provide relief. Read the letters begging for relief from each county, and each word is a tear. We cannot bear to read them. This flood is a catastrophe of unprecedented scale. In an instant, the country was turned into a swamp. Flesh and blood were separated, and the land was turned into ruins. The dead cannot be buried, and the epidemics after autumn are fearful. The living have no place to live, and their pots are broken, and there is no smoke from their stoves. Compared with any other disaster, there is nothing so tragic. We respectfully request that you will quickly issue national currency for immediate relief and prepare for a Huai River irrigation project to prevent displacement. We hope to alleviate the urgency of the water and quickly order the provincial government to rush to repair the dikes along the river to avoid collapse. We plead for the suffering people of the province.” The Anhui Native Association in Shanghai bowed and respectfully requested.</p>

<p>The China Jishi Society, in collaboration with the North China Charity Association, jointly organized an emergency relief effort in Qian County, Shaanxi Province, this spring. The society allocated 10,000 yuan for this purpose. Subsequently, the society sent Mr. Li Yunmen to Shaanxi for investigation and allocated an additional 4,000 yuan for burying accumulated corpses in Qian County. In June of this year, the Anxin Buddhist Monk from Ningbo vowed to accompany General Zhu Ziqiao to Shaanxi for relief efforts. A certain philanthropist and others jointly raised 25,000 yuan for relief in Qian County, which was distributed by the monk. Subsequently, the monk sent a telegram stating that assistance with oxen for plowing and planting was urgently needed in the county. Another gentleman and others raised 12,000 yuan for oxen for farming in Qian County, and repeatedly telegraphed Zhu Zilao to forward the funds to the Anxin Buddhist Monk for distribution. The Anxin Buddhist Monk, undeterred by distance and danger, fulfilled the Bodhisattva's vow to help people, and certain philanthropists were able to generously donate large sums to aid the dying disaster victims. It is rare to have such dedicated monks who contribute their efforts, and generous benefactors who donate money, to jointly rescue disaster victims. Even though the land is scarred, it is not difficult to mitigate the damage. The Society respectfully, on behalf of millions of disaster victims, tearfully appeals to all great benefactors.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Universal Benevolence Villa Manages Burial of the Exposed in Jiangsu and Zhejiang <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Wang Junsheng, Director of the Universal Benevolence Villa, has been entrusted by Mr. Wang Yiting, Chairman of the United Charity Organizations, to manage the burial of the exposed corpses in the Jiangsu-Zhejiang border area since four years ago. Investigations in various locations have revealed a total of over 160,000 corpses, a truly unbearable sight. Although 46,835 bodies have been buried, three-quarters remain unburied. Recently, Director Wang personally went to the inland areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang at his own expense to connect with prominent county magistrates and righteous gentry to gradually carry out the work. He plans to resume operations as early as this autumn. The required expenses are estimated to be over 10,000 yuan. Mr. Wang Yiting, deeply concerned about the large number of exposed and unburied corpses, has generously allocated 3,832 yuan from the celebrations for his father and mother's 90th birthday to support the expenses. The remaining amount still needs to be urgently raised. It is believed that this benevolent act of burial can eliminate the uncivilized custom of not burying the dead in the inland areas and will greatly benefit local public health. It is hoped that kind-hearted people from all walks of life will make benevolent vows and generously contribute to achieve complete success and improve sanitation. The merit of this undertaking is truly significant.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Customs Brokerage Industry Requests the Cancellation of Japanese Merchants' Customs Brokerage Firms <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Transshipment and Customs Brokerage Association sent letters to the City Party Headquarters, the City Chamber of Commerce, and the Anti-Japanese Aid to Overseas Chinese Association yesterday, stating: We respectfully report that before the settlement of the ten-thousand case dispute, the disaster of overseas Chinese in the Three Han (Korea) has already arrived. All of our countrymen share a deep sense of indignation. How can our industry sit idly by? Since the previous boycotts, the Japanese have been deliberately plotting. They know that the customs brokerage industry is fundamental to strangling Japanese goods. Japanese merchants in this city have been secretly organizing similar businesses, hoping to achieve a position of self-declaration and self-loading. Our industry has long been squeezed out of the market for goods going to the northern Yangtze River area. If we do not take action against Japanese customs brokerage firms according to international private law while discussing the severance of relations with Japan, it would be like chasing fish into a deep pool or scaring sparrows into a thicket. A large portion of Japanese goods will be handled and transported by the Japanese themselves. Although we in the industry are determined to save the country, we lack the means to do so. Therefore, we must inform your association in detail. When our industry clears customs, such as cotton yarn shipped to Dalian, we charge customers two taels and three qian per piece for dockage and other fees. However, the Japanese rely on factory support and enjoy various advantages, so they lower the price to one tael and six qian. It is already difficult to compete with this situation. Once relations with Japan are severed, the Japanese will certainly use all their tricks to collude with treacherous merchants and flaunt the convenience of self-declaration and self-loading, determined to attract business by lowering prices. Domestic treacherous merchants will inevitably fall for their tricks. The difficulty of this boycott will exceed that of the previous ones. We urge your association to find a way to address this. In advanced countries, foreigners are absolutely not allowed to operate customs brokerage businesses. The influence of China's tariff agreements has allowed the Japanese to freely clear customs, resulting in a loss of national sovereignty, which is undeniable. Even if the ten-thousand case dispute had not occurred, we should call on the authorities to immediately ban this. Now is the time for our country to strive for self-salvation and self-preservation. Therefore, we respectfully submit our situation and urge you to forward it to the Ministry of Finance, ordering the Tax Affairs Department to issue a document to the Customs, citing international private law to revoke the licenses of all Japanese customs brokerage firms. This will uphold national sovereignty, take into account commercial transport, and greatly benefit the national economy and the people's livelihood. The future of the boycott will be unimpeded. We eagerly await your instructions.</p>

<p>▲Informal Meeting Held the Day Before Yesterday</p>
<p>▲Sharing of Internal Responsibilities</p>
<p>Zhao Zhizhi and three other members of the Chinese Seamen's Industrial Joint Federation, along with Secretary Liu Yuzhou, left their positions the month before last, taking away important seals. Afterwards, three members, Miao Shuizhang, Qiu Yaokui, and Mu Yeyi, reported to the central authorities and requested instructions. The union affairs were temporarily maintained by the three members. Later, Zhang Jianbai was appointed by the central authorities, and He Zhenhuan, Ma Zhongxian, Wang Yongsheng, and others from the Shanghai branch were promoted. At the same time, eleven articles of the organizational law were promulgated, and the name was changed to the Chinese Seamen's Union Reorganization Committee. The new members' appointment orders have been brought to Shanghai by Mr. Zhang and distributed to the members. However, the official seal has not yet been issued, so the members have not yet taken office. Only on the afternoon of the 20th, the first informal meeting was held at the union's office on Qiujiang Road, and responsibilities were tentatively assigned. Zhang Jianbai, He Zhenhuan, and Mu Yeyi were elected as standing committee members, Qiu Yaokui as general affairs, Ma Zhongxian as guidance, and Wang Yongsheng as investigation. Under the three departments of general affairs, guidance, and investigation, it is said that six sections will be established: arbitration, accounting, organization, statistics, investigation, and documentation. Internal organization has been discussed for several days, and is actively progressing. As soon as the official seal is issued, they will take office and begin work. Secretary Wu, who was appointed by the central authorities, has also arrived in Shanghai and will officially begin work soon. Since He and Ma were promoted to members of the general association, the Shanghai branch has suspended its regular meetings on Tuesdays and Fridays due to insufficient members. Committee Member Tang previously reported to the central authorities for instructions, but no reply has been received. However, the union affairs are being handled by Tang and Luo.</p>

They lived in one room on the east side of the construction site, and nine workers lived in the three rooms on the west side. At the time of the incident, five people had already fallen asleep, and the remaining four had gone out and not returned.</p>

<h3 id="e170">Solemn and Enthusiastic Memorial Service for Overseas Chinese <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>On the morning of the 23rd of this month, people from all walks of life in Shanghai held a memorial service at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce for the overseas Chinese who died in Korea. Many people attended, and the atmosphere was very solemn. On that day, the Kuomintang flag and the national flag were crossed at the entrance of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, with a bamboo cloth banner hanging in the middle. The banner read: "Shanghai All Circles Memorial Service for Overseas Chinese Killed in Korea." Due to the wind and rain, the cloth was soaked, and the red color on the flag stained the cloth, dripping down like blood and tears, which was moving. The venue was in the conference hall. A registration desk was set up at the entrance, and representatives from all walks of life were given black yarn to wear on their arms after registering. The Shanghai Korean Groups United Association deeply hated the Japanese use of ignorant Koreans as puppets in this incident. In order to show their determination, they distributed leaflets on the spot entitled "A Letter to the Chinese People," detailing the Japanese premeditation and sinister means against China. Please note that after the fall of Korea, the Japanese oppression was extremely severe. Even the elementary school send-off meetings and the annual parent-teacher meetings were prohibited. How could the Japanese claim they were unable to suppress the thousands of Koreans who gathered for seven or eight days of slaughter? It also published six slogans: "Consolidate the Hua-Han Joint Front," "Unite to Support Revolutionary Diplomacy," "Uphold China's Sovereignty over Manchuria and Mongolia," "Long Live Korean Independence," "Long Live the Completion of the Chinese National Revolution," "Down with Japanese Imperialism." On the stage was a white cloth spirit tablet for the deceased overseas Chinese. There were no incense candles or sacrificial dishes. The stage entrance was piled with wreaths, which were donated by the Women's Relief Association. The four walls were covered with memorial banners and elegiac couplets. What I remember is recorded as follows: "Trampling on our country's land, harming our overseas Chinese compatriots, acting fiercely and unprecedentedly. If this is tolerable, what is not tolerable?" "Resist their trade, cut off their economy, persist to the end. Existence lies here, death also lies here." The Timber Industry Association. "The overseas Chinese in the sad chopping block became martyrs." "The Korean people under the mournful iron hooves were made to work for the Japanese." The Embroidery Industry Association. "Sad today, a cavity of hot blood sprays the public enemy." "Sacrifice in a foreign land, ancient heroic souls match the country's calamity." The Book Industry Association. "Cross the sea to the East, merchants, farmers, and workers, diligently operate, can be called honest and upright. Unexpectedly, a tragic robbery occurred. The world was dark. Don't say there is a number of this." "Leave the ancestral home, fathers, brothers, sons and daughters, hard management, only rely on self-reliance. Unexpectedly, a conspiracy broke out. Wolves and pigs suddenly appeared. Who says there is no one behind it." The comrades of the Shanghai Korean Gang. "The Koreans who排華 are instigated by the Japanese. They act arbitrarily, hurting our country's land. Bad news spreads, righteous indignation fills the chest, calling and running, hoping for some punishment. Economic severance, boycott of Japanese goods, work together with one heart, do not slacken. Lie on firewood and taste bitterness, the public will becomes a city, avenge this odd shame, is to comfort the gods." The Shanghai National Goods Factory Union. During the public sacrifice, members of the presidium took turns to read wills, offer flowers, read sacrificial texts, and deliver reply speeches to balance labor and leisure. During the speeches, the representative of the Social Bureau stated that the Northeast region is vast and sparsely populated, making it easy for the Japanese to covet it, and emphasized the need to pay attention to the development of the Northeast. The representative of the Korean community in Shanghai spoke in Chinese, stating that the Japanese used Korean thugs as pawns with sinister means. The representative of the Korean gang cited the fact that the Japanese had prepared in advance. Mrs. Cai Gongshi stated the ferocity of the Japanese. The representative of the City Party Headquarters stated the ambitions of the Japanese. The representative of the women's organization advised people not to buy Japanese goods in this life. The representative of the national goods organization hoped to achieve the goal of paying life for murder. The representative of the labor community emphasized that this anti-Japanese movement must be thorough and lasting. Several people also stood up to express their opinions temporarily. Some urged the committee to handle the boycott of Japanese goods fairly and not be blinded by material desires. Some reported that someone was smuggling Japanese goods on a barge and asked the inspection department to pay attention to the search. Tao Baichuan expressed his acceptance of the opinions and suggestions when giving his reply speech. He was willing to do his best to fight for the country's honor and comfort the overseas Chinese who died underground. The meeting ended when the clock struck twelve. I dip my pen to record this and express my sorrow.</p>

<h3 id="e172">Mr. Feng of Cixi Recounts <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Qihuai</p>
<p>Mr. Feng, styled Junmu, originally named Hongchi, styled Jieqing, was a native of Cixi. The Feng family of Cixi was a renowned lineage. Since the beginning of history, there have been people from the family who distinguished themselves through literature in every generation. Mr. Feng's achievements were particularly numerous. In his studies, he attended to the great without neglecting the small. His extensive knowledge and strong memory resembled those of Wang Shenning. His writings were lofty, outstanding, and austere in their purity, inwardly refined and outwardly unrestrained, like those of Wang Rongfu. In his generation, no one could match him. His poetry initially followed the styles of Du Fu and Han Yu, approaching the refinement of Li Shangyin (Yuxi). In middle age, he gradually adopted the style of the Jiangxi School. Later in life, amid turmoil and separation, his reputation diminished. Whenever he composed poems, he would harmonize with a thousand and blend with hundreds of spirits, expressing his emotions. He once said, "Composing poetry should be about finding flavor in the tasteless and seeing talent in the untalented. But who in this world understands this?" Throughout his life, he valued righteousness and upheld principles. In his youth, he and fellow townsmen Chen Jingtang, Zheng Guangzu, Feng Yuzi, Ying Qichi, Qian Baohang, Wei Youfang, Yao Shouqi, and others formed the Dun Society. They established society rules, encouraging each other to do good and admonishing each other for their faults, mutually advancing in learning and moral principles. The group discussed who should lead, and some suggested Mr. Feng. Mr. Feng said that Jingtang was clear, upright, and highly learned, truly beyond the reach of his peers, and thus suitable to be the leader. Later, some in the Dun Society were criticized for flaunting and repeating mistakes. Mr. Feng then proposed renaming it the Yan Society, a gathering for poetry and wine. Yan was chosen because Jingtang resided near Yan Mountain. Mr. Feng judged others critically, rarely praising them. He deeply admired those who were superior to him, holding them in high esteem. People respected him more for this. Mr. Feng showed early promise and quickly gained fame in his hometown. Scholars from all directions visited his courtyard, earnestly seeking his acquaintance or presenting gifts. Mr. Feng sincerely opened his heart to those who came. He would share whatever he knew, and he would never fail to tell what he had heard. He was naturally sensitive and cherished harmony. He treated everyone equally, without regard to distance or closeness. Once he connected with someone, he remained loyal for life. In his actions, he never severed ties with the common people and communicated without doubting the present. He was different in temperament from those who were content with themselves. His inner cultivation surpassed others, and his study of antiquity was marked by innovation. In his later years, he lectured in Shanghai, frequently interacting with renowned scholars of the previous dynasty. Wu Changshuo of Anji, Kuang Zhouyi of Lingui, and Zhu Xiaozang of Wuxing were particularly close to him. Several years before his death, Wu Changshuo left instructions that Mr. Feng should write his epitaph. He had just begun drafting it when he fell ill. After three months of illness, he passed away at the age of fifty-nine. Alas, heaven has deprived us of this literary talent, and the nation is without such a person. How lamentable! Mr. Feng's father, whose name is unknown, studied Confucianism without success and chose to live as a recluse in the city. He excelled at painting, and his calligraphy was elegant and refined. His mother, née Yu, was the daughter of a local Confucian scholar. She was knowledgeable, courteous, and skilled at educating her children. Mr. Feng lost his father at a young age and relied on his mother to learn poetry, grow up, become independent, and achieve success. At the age of twenty-eight, he became an instructor in Lishui County after passing the selection process for tribute students. He authored several volumes of the "Huifengtang Poetry and Prose Collection," one volume of "Lyrics," several volumes of "Diaries," and various other works. He married a woman surnamed Yu, named Yin, who authored one volume of "Fuxuezhai Lyrics." He later married women surnamed Chen and Li. He had two sons: Zhenxu, born to Yu, and Zhenyong, born to Li. He had one daughter: Zhenyu, born to Li. He had one grandson: Zhaosui, and one granddaughter: Zhaoduo, children of Zhenxu.</p>
<p>▲Brief News: Liang Junzong Ding, the current factory director of the Northeast Mining Bureau, is committed to improving industry and promoting domestic goods. His younger brother, Mr. Diancheng, is skilled in chemistry and enjoys research. He and Mr. Chen Zhenyan, the former magistrate of Taixian County who emphasized practical industries, jointly established the Sanhe Pickles Company in Lion Lane, Yangzhou. He serves as the manager and hires skilled workers to produce Sanfu Autumn Oil and Ten-Scenery Pickles using scientific methods. Because the company was founded by three people, they use "Sanhe" as their trademark. Their products include dozens of varieties such as earth lotus root, pickled bamboo shoots, milky melon, and candied ginger, packaged in cans to last for a long time. Each can costs just over twenty cents, which is much cheaper than the one-dollar-per-can "Fukushima Pickles" (also pickles) sold on the market. Not only is the taste better, but the price is also much lower. During this period of economic boycott against Japan, it is appropriate to vigorously promote this. It is reported that in Shanghai, the Jinghuatang Pharmacy manager in North Xinxinqiao and other major companies and various Southern goods stores are selling them. (Prepared)</p>
<h3 id="e173">Travelogue of India (68) <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>Along the Ganges River bank, there are many men and women living there. There are fewer female ascetics; naturally, there are more men. They vary from poor to rich, but there are more poor people. There are ancient stone piles, intact like temples, that have collapsed on the shore. It is said that they were washed down by the great flood of the past. Many new temples are being built in the future. There is a large flower pool with very clean water. It must be a great baptismal site. It makes one think that from the Ganges to the Jordan River, this ten-thousand-mile religious area is not far apart. The ancient sages all washed their hearts with water and were saved. There are ascetics who are naked and facing the sun, with only a rope tied around their waists and between their thighs. There are ascetics whose hair hangs down a foot. There are ascetics whose whole bodies are covered with ash, sitting quietly without speaking. In short, if one takes spirit as religion, then Indian culture is the world's teacher. If one takes material things as religion, then America is the king of the present age. If one takes the overthrow of material things as religion, then Russia is the king of the world. But if one takes the great mean, righteousness, fairness, and civilization as religion, perhaps the whole world will rely on China. I observe the arduous cultivation of Indian high scholars, and it makes me yearn for the ancient sages' techniques of self-salvation and saving the world.</p>
<p>A student told me, "Benares is a holy land in all of India. There are many university professors and doctors who still wish to die on the banks of the Ganges in Benares." I was shocked and asked the reason. "Are they committing suicide by throwing themselves into the river?" He said, "No. It is because all Indians have long believed that the holy land of Benares is close to the gods. Whoever dies here will have their body burned to ashes and thrown into the Ganges and be reborn in heaven." I heard the child's words and was filled with emotion. The child's fleshly body will not remain in the world for long; it is only dust. Therefore, the famous people in our country take being born in heaven as liberation. I am very surprised that this child is expounding the Dharma to me. I believe that the Buddhist scriptures repeatedly record Manjushri teaching other children. The philosophy of life of Indian children is so sharp.</p>
<p>Recently, there have been conflicts between Indians and British police again. Indians committed suicide. It is a common occurrence for Indians to clash with the British, but instead of killing the British, they commit suicide. I asked an Indian about it. The Indian said, "Gandhi teaches us not to resist the British, so we commit suicide. We would rather commit suicide than kill the British, so as not to implicate our families and friends." Indians originally considered suicide to be wrong and quite denied it in religion. Now Gandhi does not teach resistance to the British, so many are angry and commit suicide. Their resentment towards the British is great. There will definitely be an outbreak one day.</p>
<p>As for boycotting British goods, Indians say that they can save 60,000,000 yuan a year. Therefore, the whole country is united, unlike our country, where the boycott of foreign goods only lasts for five minutes. The streets are full of people wearing our country's style of coarse cloth mourning caps. Even wealthy families use coarse cloth as tablecloths. Gandhi's teachings are very similar to Lao Tzu's revivalist school: sweeten their food, beautify their clothing, delight in their dwellings, and have no contact with each other until they die. They resist material things with extreme spirit, and the materialist school has a tendency to fail. But then, can spirit also be feared? A professor told me that he observed Russian statistics. Since the establishment of the Russian government, the percentage of people receiving education has reached over 20%, compared to only 3% in old Russia. To this day, the average education in India is only 3% to 6%. In short, some Indians are inclined towards Gandhi, and some new factions are inclined towards Russia. There are also those who are inclined towards China. Their progress is the same. There is truly hope for the future. The great revolutions in China and Russia have all given the Indians great stimulation.</p>

<p>— Xu Zhuodai</p>
<p>Ziliang immediately used two fingers to catch it. He didn't dare to personally execute it, fearing that his hands would smell. So, he placed it on the melting oil on top of the candle, and sure enough, its body stuck fast and it started to burn.</p>
<p>"Since today is your first time practicing, you don't need to catch too many. I'll limit you to three!"</p>
<p>Seeing how easy it was for him, Madam naturally wanted to set a number for him. Little did she know that while the first one was a fluke, the second one turned out to be extremely difficult. He searched for a long time and simply couldn't find one. Finally, he found a young bedbug in the seam of the bedsheet, its body still completely red. He put it on the candle in the same way. The second one was already a big hassle, and the third one was of course even harder. Fortunately, Ziliang was resourceful and found a bedbug shell under the mattress. He used it to pretend to be a bedbug and put it on the candle.</p>
<p>Seeing that the three were complete, Madam made a closing statement:</p>
<p>"Alright! All the bedbugs are caught. We can sleep now!"</p>
<p>Ziliang secretly glanced at his watch and saw that it wasn't even nine o'clock yet. It would be a pity to waste such good time by sleeping so early instead of revising his essay:</p>
<p>"You go to sleep first. I still have things to do."</p>
<p>As soon as Ziliang said that, Madam came back at him:</p>
<p>"You're really unappreciative! I'm taking care of you by only asking you to catch three bedbugs, and after you're done, you don't even come to be with me, and want to go back! Fine! Then you catch thirty for me! You can't do good deeds!"</p>
<p>Before Madam could finish speaking, Ziliang had already taken off his clothes and was planning to go to bed.</p>

<h3 id="e175">Gold Standard Rebounds by Four Taels <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>▲Stormy Waves and Continued Fluctuations: Yesterday, the 24th, the gold standard showed a slight uptrend, with strong fluctuations. Between morning and noon, there was a ten-tael turnover, with stormy waves. The evening market only rose or fell by two or three taels, but eventually rebounded by four taels. It can be said that "a large drop is followed by a small rebound." The psychology of the industry seems to be weakening, but the overall selling pressure persists. From early morning, the silver market showed a decline and then rose. Afterwards, drafts were firm and then loosened, but the gold price was weak and then stabilized, once breaking through the forty-tael mark. The after-market revolved around forty taels, but there were no large-scale transactions, and the fluctuations were not as intense as in the morning market. Later, it remained firm.</p>
<p>▲Large Bars Shrink and Open Higher: The opening price for September rose by five taels to 744.5 taels (slightly higher than the after-hours price of one or two taels on the previous day). Large bars shrank by one-sixteenth, and the silver price by one-eighth. Private telegraphs were unchanged. It then retreated to 43 taels, with Bingxing, Wanxing, Shunli, and others buying in. It then rose to 47.5 taels, but then Tongtaichang, Xincheng, and Chenfengyong jointly sold off, and the Bank of England initially absorbed 125 to 1875, and then 1875 to 25, so it fell by more than six taels. In a moment, there were two or three taels of ups and downs. When the provisional order was announced, it was 41 taels, and the listed price did not move. Only Dongyang added .25, slightly increasing .05. Later, Yuanheng, Dadecheng, Bingxing, and others sold off, and the Bank of England's increasingly loosening discounts caused the bank to buy 3125, which suddenly caused the gold price to decline. It had already fallen to 35.1 taels. Then Zhifengyong, Yuanmaoyong, Yuancheng Yong, and others bought in. HSBC also absorbed .25 of October English gold, and Mitsui ate 1.625 to 3.75 of the current Dalian gold, so the Dalian gang also came to buy in, causing it to rush forward and jump up ten taels to 41 taels at 10:30. Afterwards, it suddenly turned downward, with Yuancheng, Yifengyong, Qianchangxiang, Wanxing, and Shunli all selling off, so the price could not be supported and fell seven taels to 38 taels at 11:15. Retail households bought in. At 11:30, it was 40 taels. Later, because Xincheng, Daxingyong, Yuanxingyong, and Shunli sold off, it softened again. At 11:30, it was 37.6 taels. Suddenly, there were reports of a small two annas increase in the Indian exchange rate, totaling 42 taels. The noon closing was 40 taels, with Yuanmaoyong and Yuanheng selling off. The quoted price was 793.8 taels, with a markup of 52 to 58 taels. It then became 50 taels, and the noon closing was 54 taels.</p>
<p>▲Circling Around 40 Taels: The afternoon market opened at 41 taels. The Dalian gang and others sold off, and it became 38.5 taels. The Indian exchange rate also increased by three annas. Afterwards, there were fluctuations of one or two taels. Around 2:30, retail households came to buy in, so it became 41 taels. Then, Yuda and Xixingyong sold off, and at 3:00 it was 38.45 taels. However, the exchange market was flat, and transactions were scarce. The Bank of England then quoted .25 for August English gold, and it was also reported that the Indian exchange rate had returned to a small one anna. The buying households on the trading floor seemed to be active, so it penetrated 40 taels. However, there was a fluctuation of one or two taels. After 4:00, English gold was available for sale at .25, and in addition, general floating retail households made some advances, which were pulled up by more than three taels. The closing price at 4:30 was 43.5 taels, an increase of four taels compared to the day before. It then made it to around 3.5 taels. According to the daily highs and lows, the highest was 47.5 taels and the lowest was 35.1 taels, a difference of 12.4 taels.</p>
<p>▲Tianjin Gang Suddenly Withdraws: The early morning price of goods was 44 taels, the noon closing was 40.02 taels, the afternoon closing was .03 taels, and the closing price was 3 taels. The quoted price was a markup of 50 taels, the registered loan was 38 taels and 40 taels, the water replenishment was 38 taels, and the afternoon was 42 taels. Yinfengheng initially sold hundreds of taels of spot red bars to the Tianjin gang at a price plus 10.025 taels. Later, the gang suddenly recovered more than a thousand taels at a price of only 9.5 taels, due to transportation issues. Yinfengheng then took in hundreds of taels, sold by fellow merchants. ▲The Dalian Gang Bought More Than It Sold: According to the statistics of transactions on the trading floors of various firms, Zhifengyong, Wanxing, Yuanmaoyong, and Futaiheng all bought in, while Shunli, Tongtaichang, Xincheng, Yuancheng, Dadecheng, Chenfengyong, Yuanxingyong, Mr. Wu, and Cuichangyong all sold off. Yuantai, Yuanchun, and Yuancheng, Daxingyong, and others had inconsistent inflows and outflows. In the afternoon, Zhifengyong, Yuantai, Futaiheng, Yifengyong, Yuankangxiang, Dakang, and Yuandayong were very busy with inflows and outflows. Yuda, Richang, and Wanxing all bought in, while Yuanmaoyong, Yuancheng, Yuanheng, Dadecheng, and Yuanxingyong all sold off. Qianchangxiang, Longsheng, and Yuhe alternately bought and sold, but there were no large-scale transactions. The Dalian gang bought in more than three thousand taels, and sold a total of two thousand bars. The Guangdong gang still had no transactions.</p>

Observing the situation the day before, the price of foreign coppers showed signs of weakness again, but yesterday afternoon it seemed to be increasing again. From the overall trend, even if there is no large drop, it is difficult to have a large increase. As for the silver and foreign copper needs of all parties, the situation is also very indifferent. There is really no new news worth recording.</p>

<h3 id="e179">Securities and Bond Markets Continue to Fall <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's bond market, the futures market was calm. The sentiment of buyers and sellers in the front and rear markets was always idle. The spot transactions were also as sparse as before. The various prices yesterday mostly fell, but the major buyers and sellers all only entered and exited sporadically, so the supply and demand situation was very flat. The prices only circled downwards, without seeing major changes. The stagnant situation was really no different than before. As a result, the February 0 future and the July 0 customs both fell by 1 yuan and 2 jiao. The August 19 customs futures and the current month's entire six copies also fell by 8 or 9 jiao. The others only had ups and downs of several jiao. Observing the current state of the bond market, it seems that it has not yet escaped the depressed state. It is estimated that the spot transactions were only 4,000 yuan, and the futures were only more than 11.6 million. In addition, the Securities Exchange decided to temporarily conduct one trading session in the afternoon starting from today due to the increasingly hot weather.</p>

<h3 id="e180">Cotton Yarn: Yarn Market Fluctuates <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market was weak in the morning and rose in the afternoon, with a generally tight trend. Because the inspection of inferior goods was very strict, some people still had strong bullish intentions. However, rumors about the current situation continued to be heard, and the business of 10-count coarse yarn remained sluggish. The empty amount of a certain major household did not move, and both sides were in a stalemate. However, the sales of spot yarn were still developing, and the transactions of Japanese yarn on the market were lonely, while the price of domestic yarn was trending upwards.</p>
<p>▲People's Standard Afternoon Rebound: The exchange's People's Standard opened in the morning with American cotton being flat and each month falling by 7.9 qian to 1 tael. In the afternoon, it was heard that the current sales were good and the trend of inspecting inferior goods was tight, so the market atmosphere suddenly turned tight and bullish, with each month rising by 3.6 qian to 1 tael and 2 qian. The transactions totaled 28,650 bales. It was found that Xincheng sold 1,250 bales, Yuantai 700 bales, Tianlong 700 bales, Rongxing 650 bales, and Jifeng 900 bales. Dachang bought 1,100 bales, Deji 750 bales, Gengfeng 800 bales, and Shenchang 600 bales. The closing prices of the People's Standard are recorded below, with the closing prices of the People's Standard, changes, and loan balances.</p>
<p>Contract | Closing Price | Change | Loan Balance</p>
<p>------- | -------- | -------- | --------</p>
<p>July | 163.7 | Down 3 | 20,800 | October | 164.0 | Up 1 | 92,500</p>
<p>August | 164.8 | Up 1 | 77,400 | November | 164.5 | Up 2 | 82,600</p>
<p>September | 163.0 | Up 1 | 97,100 | December | 165.3 | Up 1 | 69,700</p>
<p>▲Spot Yarn Sales are Still Smooth: The sales of spot yarn are still good. It was found that all the gangs bought a total of 2,500 bales throughout the day. 100 bales were entered among the merchants, and the market was flat. The customer gangs entered 1,200 bales from Sichuan, 150 bales from Ningbo, 220 bales from Changsha, 480 bales from inland, 100 bales from Tianjin, 80 bales from the Northern gang, 75 bales from Qingdao, and 220 bales from miscellaneous gangs.</p>

<p>The cotton market trend shows slight fluctuations. Due to the mediocre performance of foreign cotton and the poor weather in this port—intermittent rain and sunshine—concerns arise about the development of new cotton. Some areas report water damage. Therefore, inland merchants tend to buy, while the local brokers are slightly selling. Current cotton business remains sluggish.</p>
<p>▲Hanbiao Initially Drops, Then Rises The Hanbiao market on the exchange opened lower due to flat foreign cotton and sunny weather, dropping three to four cents. In the afternoon, it became overcast, and the weather tightened, rising three cents. Total transaction volume was 100,080 bales. Sales included 3,400 bales of Jifeng, 2,000 bales of Shenchang, 2,000 bales of Yichang, and 2,500 bales of Jinfeng. Purchases included 3,800 bales of Rongxing, 7,100 bales of Dachang, 1,300 bales of Dafeng, and 1,900 bales of Daji. The closing price of Hanbiao is recorded below:</p>

<h3 id="e183">Grain: River Rice Market Sales Brisk, Prices Rising <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>▲Xinzha: Yesterday, slightly fewer goods arrived from the west. Heavy rain in the morning prevented any buying. By the afternoon, the weather cleared, and shops facing the market were quite active. Recently, there has been too much rain, causing anxiety. River rice reserves are dwindling, and fewer new arrivals are seen. Prices are gradually increasing, with Changsu thick japonica rice and early/late rice harvests arriving in small quantities. Prices are 3 to 6 jiao higher than the previous two days. Kunshan rice and Luyang pointed rice are both up 2 to 3 jiao, and the trend is tightening. Glutinous rice fluctuates slightly. The river factories sold 5,000 to 6,000 dan of various goods.</p>
<p>▲Nanshi: Due to the rain, few goods arrived from various sources. River reserves are also low. City and rural shops sold well due to the rain, making it difficult to ship goods from the interior, boosting confidence. Shops were active in buying, leading to high transaction volumes. The price of thick japonica rice increased by another 2 to 3 jiao. Thin rice arrivals are lacking, but demand is high. The market price increased by about 2 jiao. Until 10 o'clock, only two boats arrived, but they had not yet started selling. The arrival of thin and thick japonica rice is increasingly rare. It is heard that there has been too much rain in various places for days, and low-lying areas may be flooded. Duyang pointed rice is still available in small quantities and sells well. Prices have increased, and supply and demand are tight, creating a firm market.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Flour Market's Buying Interest Is Strong <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>▲Inland Merchants Compete to Buy Regardless of Price</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market showed a firm and brisk trend. Although the quoted price of foreign wheat decreased slightly by 1 to 2 jiao, from the previous day to yesterday morning, there were torrential downpours, no different from a deluge. Disaster reports frequently came from Jiangnan and Jiangbei, and food prices rose sharply. Therefore, inland merchants and those along the Yangtze River spared no effort to compete for purchases regardless of market prices (with half-day transactions reaching over 1.1 million). Fortunately, some factories had fixed production, so they sold forward contracts, and the market atmosphere gradually stabilized. Otherwise, the increase would have been even more considerable. Looking ahead, due to the rain, it is feared that public sentiment will not easily calm down. As a result, this month increased by 1.5 fen compared to Wednesday, August increased by 1 fen, September, October, and November increased by 7.5 li, and December increased by 2.5 li.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Wheat Futures' Rising Trend Is Formidable <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>▲Inland Merchants and Factories Absorb 200 to 300 Cars</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market showed a serious trend. People in the interior generally believed that the continuous heavy rain had affected the crops and predicted that grain prices would soar. Therefore, buying interest was unusually strong, with step-by-step competition. It was heard that inland factories in Nanjing and Nantong were also absorbing a lot, totaling between 200 and 300 cars. However, due to the fact that four ships of Australian wheat were traded over the past two days, totaling over 20,000 tons, local merchants took advantage of this opportunity to sell in layers (total daily transaction volume was estimated at over 10 million), about 500 cars' worth. However, with rising public sentiment, it did not soften because of this. Without this batch of selling, speculators' raising of prices would have been unpredictable. Because August is the near month, sellers did not sell, and the increase was the greatest. The remaining increased by only 3 to 5 fen. As a result, this month increased by 3 fen compared to Wednesday, August increased by 7 fen, September increased by 5 fen, October increased by 3 fen, November increased by 2 fen, and December increased by 3 fen. In spot wheat transactions, the price for return to standard was high, and the quoted price also increased by 3 to 5 fen. Fuxin handled 1,400 bags of wheat from Benniu, Danyang, Yangzhou, Pudong, Kunshan, Zhoupu, Jiading, Huangdu, Shuangfeng, etc., and Huafeng handled 2,500 bags.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Silk and Tea: New York Raw Silk Market Active but Unsaleable <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>The climate in New York this summer is extremely hot. Silk factories cannot operate and have successively stopped for summer vacation early. The raw silk market is stagnant due to inactive factory sales. Except for Japanese silk, raw silk from China, Italy, and France has been unsaleable for two weeks. Silk prices have fallen across the board. Shanghai factories have fallen by 3 to 4 jiao per pound, Japanese silk has fallen by 2 to 3 jiao, and Italian silk has also fallen by about 3 jiao. Therefore, silk sales in Shanghai Port have not improved.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Silk Sales in Europe and America Are Almost Stagnant <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Sales of Chinese silk from European and American markets are stagnant. There has been no transfer of silk telegrams to Shanghai, and the market atmosphere is listless. Yesterday, only Weicheng imported 10 bales of Shanghai white filature, and Kechang and others imported 18 bales of yellow coarse silk. Prices were firm.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Luzhuang Green Tea Sales to Europe Continue to Be Brisk <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the tea market for foreign firms in this port saw brisk sales of Luzhuang needle tea, eyebrow tea, and superior eyebrow tea to Europe. Major merchants from Wuyuan also sold their goods as soon as they arrived, and the market was not lonely. Gaozhuang Zhenmei, Baochang, Yongxing, and other firms resumed their interest in buying, but their bids were too low. Chinese tea merchants insisted on not selling. Therefore, there were still no large transactions. Currently, the market's Qihong reserves are no more than 14,000 ji, and green tea reserves are no more than 110,000 boxes. The amounts are not large.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Piece Goods: Dong Pi (Japanese Piece Goods) from the Yangtze River Continue to Be Shipped <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>Since the boycott of Japanese goods began, piece goods have become highly sought after. In recent years, Japanese goods have accounted for 80 to 90 percent of piece goods. Strict boycotts have severely impacted Japanese merchants. Although Chinese people have gradually paid attention to the dyeing and weaving industry, the scale is relatively small, and supply cannot meet demand. Therefore, local merchants have been searching for spot goods since the Korean Incident. Sales have been even more brisk than during last year's soaring gold prices. After all the reserves were exhausted, Osaka rushed to ship goods to Shanghai, and sales were quite good. Yesterday, merchants from Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, and Shantou were still shipping goods. Because this street has detained a lot of goods in recent days, they no longer dare to try. Prices have gradually weakened. Yesterday, Yuehua class fell by 2.5 li. Zhongbing's "Heavenly Yang Guifei" was 2 qian and 4 fen, and Wakayama black floral was 2 qian and 4.5 fen. Lao Hua's straight tribute flannel was exceptionally popular. Although it was 4 qian and 2.5 fen yesterday, there were no spot goods. Lao Hua's dark-colored Ting once ran out of stock and has now been successively arriving in Shanghai. However, the boycott is strict, and it cannot be sold. Because Western goods have few reserves, even if sales of Eastern goods are hindered, they are still not active.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Monochrome Raincoat Fabric Is Uniquely Popular <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>The market for woolens and flannels has not seen much activity recently. Goods from Tongtai, Mitsui, Iwai, etc., have been affected by the boycott. Although the prices are low, there are still few buyers. However, with continuous heavy rain, the sales of raincoat fabric have become very active. The price of single-sided open water beauty is firm, averaging 5 taels and 2 qian per yard for each brand. Monochrome fabrics are scarce and popular. The asking price for the top grade of thin woolen fabric is 3 taels and 7 qian, and the second grade is 3 taels and 3 qian. Single-layer bald blue must add 3 to 4 qian. The prices of yarn surfaces are not greatly fluctuating. Madase flat uniform is priced at 1 tael, 6 qian, and 7.5 fen. Taihe double-sided sand is 3 taels and 4 qian, silk dotted flowers and iridescent colors are 3 taels and 6.5 qian, and double-sided open water beauty is 6 taels and 6 qian.</p>

<p>Yesterday, according to a letter from Hankou, a batch of new Xiang lotus seeds had arrived in Hankou, totaling 13 boxes of Hengzhou goods, which were purchased by Shanghai firms. The price per dan was 29 taels and 4 qian, and the cost per dan, including handling, was 50 taels. It will be shipped from the origin and is expected to arrive in Shanghai soon. It is predicted that the initial selling price will not be out of line.</p>

<p>Since the Wanbaoshan Incident, the work of refusing goods has become increasingly tense. Orders for Japanese goods have been occasionally suspended, so the coal market also shows signs of unease. Market prices have risen across the board. However, because it is summer, all uses have decreased, and sales are not smooth. In addition, warehouses are full of stock. Although firms have been quoting prices every day, the number of transactions is not large. Except for the slight purchase of No. 3 coal by out-of-port merchants, local firms and shops are still rarely buying, so the market is relatively stable.</p>

<h3 id="e211">Turkey Queen <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Yuxiang</p>
<p>American Businesswoman</p>
<p>Famous Far and Wide</p>
<p>In Idaho, USA, there is currently a woman whose name is well-known to everyone in the state, regardless of age or gender, and they respectfully call her the Turkey Queen.</p>
<p>Six years ago, she was like many other farmers' wives, diligently raising a few turkeys in her spare time, selling them for money to supplement the family income and help her husband make a living. However, now, due to her business talent and hard work, she has become a leader of a business association. The members affiliated with that association total 1,800 people, and the total annual trade volume exceeds US$750,000. In addition, the most praiseworthy point is that under her leadership, 1,400 American farm women have been able to obtain economic benefits.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1924, in Boise, Idaho, USA, a Mrs. Brink first proposed establishing a turkey market. In that area, this was simply an innovation, as it had never been done before. The motive for the proposal was that her small flock of turkeys, which she had raised that year, was ready for sale after growing up, but there was not a single buyer in sight. At the same time, hundreds of other farm women were also experiencing the same difficulty. So she thought, why not organize a public group to sell local turkeys together? In this way, large quantities of turkeys could be contracted and sold at good prices to markets in the East and South.</p>
<p>After spending a lot of time and effort, Mrs. Brink's plan finally came to fruition. When this turkey business association was first established, there were only fourteen core members. In the first year after its establishment, the turkeys sold to the Eastern market only filled three freight cars. However, the price obtained broke all previous records for the price of Idaho turkeys. In general, families that raised turkeys received an unexpected bumper harvest.</p>
<p>In the second year, the turkey business association sold several times more turkeys than the previous year, filling twelve freight cars. In the third year, it increased to twenty-seven cars, and in the fourth year, it actually filled forty-six cars. According to a recent survey, between 1930 and 1931, the association transported a full sixty-five freight cars of turkeys out of the state. The total annual trade volume exceeded US$750,000. Moreover, last year's national turkey market prices in the United States were all based on the Idaho Turkey Association's regulations, which shows its market-manipulating power.</p>
<p>The turkey association established by Mrs. Brink is now very developed. The turkey-raising families affiliated with it are not only limited to Idaho, but also extend to the eastern part of Oregon and the southern parts of Idaho. Most of the members, nearly 90 percent, are farm women. Under the leadership of Mrs. Brink, these women know to pay considerable attention to raising turkeys. They are familiar with a special method that allows them to select superior varieties of turkeys and to breed flocks with minimal consumption. Currently, Mrs. Brink's family alone sells more than 1,500 turkeys each year.</p>

<p>Nominally Academic Research, Actually Political Significance</p>
<p>Rome Dispatch: The first conference on population problems is scheduled to be held in Rome from September 7th to 10th. Mussolini himself will serve as chairman, with the support and establishment of Professor Gini of the University of Rome, President of the Italian Central Statistical Institute. It is nominally for academic research on population issues in various countries, but in reality, it has political significance.</p>

<p>Sold to Dingsin Company</p>
<p>Tokyo Dispatch: The Gas By-Products Company, an affiliate of Tokyo Gas, is currently planning to export coal slag to China and Southeast Asia. It has already signed a contract with the Sino-German joint-venture steel company, New Company, in Shanghai, to sell 12,000 tons of coal slag, starting in August and to be delivered in six months.</p>
<h3 id="e214">Japan Can Be Called a Bicycle Kingdom <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>5 Million Bicycles Nationwide, Over 24,000 Manufacturing and Repair Shops</p>
<p>According to the Eastern News, the manufacturing and use of bicycles in Japan has been expanding year by year, presenting a surprising phenomenon. The total number of bicycles nationwide in 1913 was 487,076. By 1924, this had increased to 3,675,359, and by December 1930, it had further increased to over 5 million. The use of bicycles by Japanese people is probably the most widespread among all countries. For example, France, the birthplace of the bicycle, only had 223,020 bicycles in 1894. In the United States, except for motorcycles, ordinary bicycles have long disappeared from the streets. The number of bicycles in the UK is almost equal to the number of automobiles. Germany has more bicycles than automobiles. Although the use of automobiles in Japan is gradually increasing, the use of bicycles still has a tendency to expand. According to a 1924 survey, there were as many as 14,214 bicycle manufacturing and repair shops nationwide. The total annual value of the bicycle manufacturing industry is 241.5 million Japanese yen, and it is predicted that it will expand to 300 million yen within five years, becoming one of Japan's largest industries. The United States is called the "Automobile Kingdom," Japan can be called the "Bicycle Kingdom."</p>

<p>(7) Life Sketches</p>
<p>A light drink can be bought from the drugstore downstairs, tell them to send it upstairs. Mamie and Brad drink it several times. The young people dancing here don't drink intoxicating liquor. Perhaps they are too poor to buy that kind of expensive wine. Many of them are also very clean.</p>
<p>When midnight arrives, the music stops, which makes the young people exceptionally sad. They ask for one more dance, and sometimes the band agrees.</p>
<p>When it's time to go home, Mamie feels very tired. She has been standing in the store all day, and dancing for several hours in the evening. Now she craves sleep. She is too tired to talk to Brad. He says to her in simple tones, "Beautiful music," "You are a wonderful dance partner."</p>
<p>The two of them arrive at Mamie's door together. Everyone in the house is fast asleep, so they must be very quiet. Brad, of course, can't go inside, because all the rooms in the shared apartment, except for the kitchen, are used as bedrooms. The two of them whisper outside the door for a moment. Mamie says goodnight and puts the key in the lock.</p>
<p>"Mamie," Brad grips her jade arm. "Kiss me, I'm crazy about you."</p>
<p>"Brad, don't, give it up, you absolutely can't do this," Mamie struggles, battling with her own thoughts.</p>
<p>"Just one kiss will do," he pleads. She turns her head and imprints a kiss on his cheek, then she runs into the house.</p>
<p>Mamie has to take off her clothes in the dark, because her sisters are sleeping very soundly. Mamie still feels her lips on Brad's cheek. She has already kissed him. Although she is very tired, she still can't fall asleep immediately. She starts to wonder what she is going to encounter. Is she going to marry someone like Brad? A small shared apartment, working at home all day, and children - that is mostly her destiny - like what her mother encountered. But with Brad, sometimes she feels very sweet, and sometimes she feels very fulfilled, which makes her have passionate dreams. Or will she continue to work in the store - perhaps in a few years, she will be able to get an important position. She has to get up early the next morning, overthinking will inevitably lead to insomnia. She puts her head on the soft pillow, and in an instant, she leaves this real world.</p>

<p>— Mansheng</p>
<p>It was a clear summer morning.</p>
<p>Orange-yellow light flickered in the trees, and the birds chattered on the branches.</p>
<p>He jumped off the tram carrying a pack of Japanese pastries, excitedly walking to the door of No. 39 South Luce Lee. This was it. A faint tremor suddenly rose in his heart. He stopped, hesitating for a while like this. After all, he still raised his head, puffed out his chest, and strode in.</p>
<p>A distressing scene revealed itself before his eyes, which he would never forget, until the moment his soul was lost.</p>
<p>The door of the garret was open, and there was nothing inside except for a heavy iron bed. He was stunned.</p>
<p>On the door, a strip of paper was swaying in the breeze. He went closer to look and saw that it was left for Miss Yi, probably saying that she had also moved away... His eyes suddenly blurred, and every word on the paper seemed to jump. "Anyway, she moved. What's the use of thinking about it?" He thought this way, and at the same time, his sight shifted direction.</p>
<p>He looked around with melancholy, his mind also starting to spin non-stop. Ah, wasn't there a bookshelf here? Wasn't there a desk over there? Wasn't there a photo of her standing on the desk? Ah, the bed, wasn't a tired young woman's sleeping face revealed on this bed four days ago? Happy memories suddenly invaded his mind. He was fantasizing.</p>
<p>Early in the morning four days ago, he stood straight in front of the door of the garret, making an effort to lift his slightly trembling right hand, and lightly tapped on the door.</p>
<p>"Who is it?"</p>
<p>"It's me. Aren't you up yet?... It's nothing..."</p>
<p>... He said haltingly.</p>
<p>"Wait for me to open it," came a sound from inside. She was opening the door.</p>
<p>"Wait a moment before coming in."</p>
<p>"Uh."</p>
<p>She hurriedly burrowed back into the quilt.</p>
<p>He finally went in.</p>
<p>"Good Morning," he said casually.</p>
<p>"............" She smiled.</p>
<p>Her sleepy eyes opened and closed lively, and her wavy hair was scattered on the pillow... All of the beauty of a young woman was reflected in his eyes, in his mind, directly reaching the depths of his heart.</p>
<p>"Sit down," a nightingale-like tone called him back from his daydream.</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>"Yes... Don't be polite," he answered, at a loss.</p>
<p>He sat down. Silence occupied everything. He struggled to say as much as he wanted to say to her, but in the end, it was stopped by his trembling lips.</p>
<p>He began to break the silence in the room.</p>
<p>"I went to see a movie with Mr. Shi last night. Because it was too late, I didn't have time to go back to school, so I slept at his place. Today, I happened to come by..." He seemed to be explaining his intention in coming, talking non-stop.</p>
<p>"Which one?"</p>
<p>"Apollo. The movie wasn't very good."</p>
<p>There was silence again for a while.</p>
<p>"Let's go to see a movie on Sunday. Wait for me here," he was pleading.</p>
<p>"Okay."</p>
<p>The conversation started like this.</p>
<p>They talked like this for a while.</p>
<p>"Go out for a moment, let me get up," she said to him with a smile.</p>
<p>"Okay." Naturally, he walked out with a smile.</p>
<p>She was washing up.</p>
<p>He was always staring at her or her photo in a daze. Suddenly, he took out a Parker pen and a small notebook from his pocket, writing with a rustling sound.</p>
<p>Hot blood rolled like burning,</p>
<p>Life drifted like duckweed,</p>
<p>Revealing a little of the bitterness of life,</p>
<p>The universe is so dim,</p>
<p>The world is so unfair,</p>
<p>Conflict, ah, struggle,</p>
<p>That is the path we should take,</p>
<p>While your youth still exists,</p>
<p>While your blood has not yet congealed,</p>
<p>This final struggle, ah,</p>
<p>Cling tightly to your entire life,</p>
<p>"That's not very good."</p>
<p>He finally handed it to her.</p>
<p>"Very good."</p>
<p>"That one."</p>
<p>Old events, like a movie, flashed through his mind one by one. He couldn't support it any longer. He lowered his head and walked down the stairs in disappointment.</p>
<p>The landlady was washing clothes.</p>
<p>"Where did Miss Ke go?"</p>
<p>"Went back. Isn't she from the western province?"</p>
<p>"When?"</p>
<p>"Yesterday at four o'clock."</p>
<p>"Hmm."</p>
<p>Slow steps carried the heavy body slowly out of the house. He sighed very weakly.</p>
<p>The sun had passed through the trees and shone on the roof, and the birds had stopped singing. People were hurrying to their work. He still kept his head down, his hands in his coat pockets, wandering aimlessly back and forth on Avenue A, seemingly humming very softly, "When I awake to found you gone Ramona, I need you my own!"</p>

<p>— Li Zuoyou</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, it's a holiday today. Excuse the class," said Duo Yan as soon as he saw Mr. Chen come to class. Originally, today was supposed to be a holiday as usual, but for some reason, there was no notice about the holiday in the notice box. The students didn't have the courage to ask the director to excuse the class, so they had to take a step back and attack the easygoing teacher.</p>
<p>"No, no," Mr. Chen said, shaking his head.</p>
<p>"Ah, just be easygoing. Anyway, our hearts aren't in it," Kai continued to plead.</p>
<p>"What's the point of excusing the class? Why don't we tell a funny story?"</p>
<p>"Good, good," Kai, who wanted to excuse the class, said.</p>
<p>"During the Qingming Festival, it rains heavily... Who can complete the whole poem?" Mr. Chen said with a face full of spring breeze.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, I'll continue a line," Huai said, but Mr. Chen just shook his head and waved his hand, not saying a word.</p>
<p>"I'll continue two lines, okay?" Li thought that Mr. Chen's silence meant yes, so he pressured Mr. Chen to answer.</p>
<p>But Mr. Chen still didn't say a word, because his purpose was to have the whole poem completed. One or two lines didn't have much meaning.</p>
<p>Later, Ke raised his hand, but Mr. Chen didn't notice him, so he didn't greet him. He had no choice but to put down his hand.</p>
<p>"Who can write the whole poem?"</p>
<p>"Hey, raise your hand quickly, the teacher is asking someone to go out and write it," Li said to Ke, but Ke didn't raise his hand. He became anxious. He directly pointed at Ke and said to the teacher, "He knows, he knows." He also said to Ke, "Hey, write it quickly. After you write it, we can excuse the class."</p>
<p>Ke wrote on the blackboard, probably because of the magic of the word "Excuse."</p>
<p>Mr. Chen looked at the blackboard and read a poem. The words of the poem were like this:</p>
<p>"During the Qingming Festival, it rains heavily. The traveler on the road is on the verge of despair. May I ask where there is a tavern? A shepherd boy points to the Apricot Blossom Village."</p>
<p>"Who can punctuate it?"</p>
<p>"I know," Si said.</p>
<p>"I know, I know," Ding, nicknamed "Strange Man," said urgently. He didn't care which one the teacher had allowed, and rushed to punctuate it. Si let him.</p>
<p>"Huh, ,,," The classmates saw that he had rushed out to punctuate it, which was too rude, and his punctuation didn't seem very suitable for the poem, so they all ridiculed him with sarcasm.</p>
<p>"That's right, he punctuated it as a Ci poem," Mr. Chen said.</p>
<p>The classroom was suddenly quiet for a few seconds, but soon the atmosphere of "Excuse" filled the classroom again. They were going to attack the teacher again.</p>
<p>"Ah, it's written well, and it's punctuated well. When are we going to excuse the class?" Si said.</p>
<p>"No, no."</p>
<p>"You didn't excuse any classes last semester. Let's excuse it today, consider it your treat, okay?" Da said.</p>
<p>"Ha, ha, you haven't even treated me yet, and now you want me to treat you? Ha, ha, it's really one generation worse than the last. In the past, when you were a disciple, you had to have wine and food to treat the teacher. Ha, ha," Mr. Chen laughed so hard that he couldn't stand up straight. The students also laughed along with Mr. Chen in a disruptive manner. They knew that in this kind of situation, if they laughed like this, although it was somewhat inappropriate, the teacher would definitely not treat them with harsh words and expressions.</p>
<p>Kai hadn't spoken for a long time. At this time, his tongue had already been jumping, ready to issue a mobilization order. He said with a mischievous tone, "Um, Mr. Chen, I heard that the steamed pork buns in the kitchen taste pretty good. How about we go and order the buns now?" He ran towards the door like he was charging. The students near the door also rushed out the door. But Mr. Chen hurriedly stopped the students who were about to rush out but hadn't rushed out yet. He didn't know what to say. He became anxious, and just quickly waved both hands left and right in front of his chest, his face looking like he was angry but not angry, like he was smiling but not smiling. He used his hands to stop them, not letting them go outside. The students who hadn't left the door, because they were stopped by Mr. Chen, and if they did this, the teacher would be terribly angry, so they all retreated like defeated soldiers.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen saw that they had sat down, and then said,</p>
<p>"Um, listen."</p>
<p>"Um, listen," the students followed Mr. Chen and said, because Mr. Chen's "Listen" contained a special tone and meaning. But Mr. Chen ignored them and continued,</p>
<p>"Today, we'll talk about Zhu Guangqian's 'Talking about Movement'."</p>
<p>"Teacher, form is emptiness, and emptiness is form. But when we haven't yet understood what form is, how can we know what emptiness is? So before talking about movement, we should excuse a class, let us experience what movement is, and then talk about theoretical movement," said Wei, nicknamed "Literary Man."</p>
<p>"Um, that's right, that's right," everyone shouted like they were cheering.</p>
<p>"No, no, we can't excuse the class now, because..."</p>
<p>Before Mr. Chen could finish speaking, they listened again, "Yes, yes," and they began their second charge.</p>
<p>Da, who was closest to the door, got up and opened the door. They all rushed out together as if they had prepared for it. By the time Mr. Chen wanted to stop them, it was already too late, because most of the people had already left. Mr. Chen had no choice but to smile, shake his head, take the loose-leaf anthology, put on his already changed-looking woolen hat, and talk and laugh with the students who hadn't left yet, slowly walking out of the classroom door.</p>
