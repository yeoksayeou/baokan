<p>時評</p>
<h3>提倡國術</h3>
<p>欲强國家先强種族。欲强種族。則尤應先强國民。我國積弱迄今。外侮紛乘。致此之因因不一。而國民無健全之身體。都奄奄如病夫。寖至民多夭亡。種日羸弱。則尤爲其大因。有健全之國民。然後有健全之種族。有健全之體格。然後有健全之意志。積弱之種族。乃受天然之淘汰。薄弱之意志。乃因循萎靡。末克自振。故國弱先自民弱。而强國亦必先强民。我國處於今日積弱形勢之下。欲圖維新。則鍜鍊國民體格。使人人壯且健。一洗東方病夫國之恥辱。乃爲至要。　　我國故有之拳勇技擊。其法至簡。而其裨益身體。則至均平日。本之武士道。卽得力於此。國人習於此道。歷史極深。至今各地鄉民操作之暇。尤多練習。假使就此道而積極恢復之。發揚之。則其裨益於我種族我國家者。當爲力至多</p>
<p>孫中山先生曾有言。「中國拳勇技擊。與西洋飛機大砲同等作用。恢復發揚之。」其用意决非在於保存國粹。蓋酌其利害。我民情。實以此爲收效較宏而且切也。</p>
<p>比來中央國術館張之江鈕永建諸君發起設立國術學校。養成國術師資。</p>
<p>使普及民衆。以樹强我種族之始基用意至善。國人亟應予以扶掖。共助其成。　　雖然。一事甫成。一弊卽生。國術之有裨於我國家我種族者固大。但假若教</p>
<p>者習者。對此無正確之觀念。無深遠之認識僅視爲好勇鬬狠之工具。或囿於舊方。不能參以新的科學方法。則流弊亦至大。記者謹就所見。略貢數點。</p>
<p>（一）提倡國術。不貴乎造成少數出人頭地之專家。尤忌養成好勇鬬狠之風氣。必基於鍜鍊體格之純正意義上。求其普及。全國學校。亦都應附設此科。藉收實效。</p>
<p>（二）住日門戸之見派别之分。實爲固步自封尤失鍜鍊體格本意。亟應化除。　　（三）練習國術在求强健身體。不在技藝之精否。不重個人之榮譽。故比武式之練習。錦標式之競奪危人性命。以博一己之榮譽。流弊至大。亟應改正。</p>
<p>（四）舊日方法。多不科學。今日練習宜參以科學知識。務使其適合衞生。至於其他用横蠻方法。壓迫身體以求其局部之特别發展尤宜糾正。</p>
<p>要之提倡國術。非爲保存國粹。亦非專爲厮鬬。其惟一之目的。厥爲鍜鍊健全之國民。能本此純正之目的做去。庶不至流弊滋生耳。</p>

<h3>韓民移殖東北之研究</h3>
<p>（八續）彬</p>
<p>（四）韓民移殖對於東北之迫害就上章所述。可知韓人在日帝國主義殖民政策指揮之下。積極向我東北移殖。正方興未艾。而其目前移殖額之巨大。分佈區域之廣濶。及職業之複雜。同時更益以日人之利用與指使。在在給予我東北以無窮之迫害。略述如次。</p>
<p>（一）水田利益之攘奪—東北水田與旱田之收穫。約爲三五與一○之比。韓人播種水田。最爲擅長。故東北江河沿岸各地。由日本東拓會社或滿洲金融組合。貸給資金嗾使親日韓人四出。租種水田。以謀壟斷東北之稻田事業。據本年六月調查。遼省如鴨綠江總支流域沿岸輝南·安圖·臨江·柳河·莊河·遼源·安東·康平·本溪湖·沙河口·通河·長白·黑山·西豐·東豐·及渾河兩岸之營口·海城·洮南·新民·興京等地。韓民租地種稻者。約二十五萬人以上。所佔水田面積。約二百萬晌有奇。吉林如松花圖們牡丹三江。及遼河伊通河各流域之延吉·琿春·汪淸·和龍·寗安·敦化·額穆·東寗·密山·同江·富錦·濛江·樺川·樺甸·虎林·吉林·長春·伊通·德惠·長嶺·扶餘·依蘭·等地。統計韓民種稻者。約三十萬人以上。所佔水田面積。約在四百萬晌左右、黑龍江省如嫩江黑河上下游岸之黑嫩江·楊源·呼蘭·綏化·海倫·木蘭巴彦克東熱河道化呼倫勃利各地。韓民租地種田者。約五六萬人以上。水田面積。約在十五萬晌有餘。總之東北三省江河流域及窪地低田地帶。莫不有韓農足跡遍佈其間、大好水田利益、幾盡爲韓人日人所直接間接奪去。不僅此也。日人一面嗾使韓人往我東北内地租地耕種。一面復由滿鐵會社貸以本金、謁力奬勵滿鐵沿線之韓民開闢水田。且將沿線我國人所種之水田。一律攘奪。以供韓農之用。據日方預計。三年之内。滿鐵沿線。可增水田三十萬頃。此種積極奬勵韓民之租種農田。與開闢農田。其目的不僅在鼓厲韓農之對我移殖。而其最爲險毒者。尤爲假韓農之手。以收買我土地。據爲己有。其攘奪我國權。危害我民食。莫此爲甚。次之。歷年來韓農與我國農民因爭奪水源稻田。更肇出無窮糾紛。如過去撫順縣韓僑强佔民地挖溝灌水案。及最近萬寳山事件。皆其實例也。（未完）</p>

<h3>成都之奇異石器</h3>
<p>— 張炎</p>
<p>▲石算盤能打　▲石樂器能吹</p>
<p>距成都西門外二十里許。有犀浦塲伍家林子地方。該處林木蓊鬱。風景蒨幽。於綠樹叢中。有某姓獨力所建之石一。其棟·樑·椽·壁·窗格·門楣。均係石製。雕鏤精絶。别具匠心。其壁上彫刻之魚蟲花鳥。走獸飛禽。均栩栩如生。躍躍欲活。最奇者。壁上所鑿之石算盤。珠子均能活動。而旱烟筒一管。能裝烟吸納。又鏤有鳥籠一隻。係突出石面。内有石盂。石站台。一鳥立台上。開口振翼作鳴勢。又有石獅子一。週身毛片作波紋。纖細如絲。雙瞳炯炯。奕奕有神。獅口内啣一球。以手探之。雖圓轉自如。終不能取出。尤奇者。花園魚池之石闌干柱頂。每一頂上。鑿鏤一肥胖小兒。或持笙。或持海螺。或持簫。或持笛。游人以口吹之。均能一一作響。音樂家吹之。並能抑揚頓挫云。</p>
<h3>養氣殺蚊之新方法</h3>
<p>— 黄影呆</p>
<p>▲美國科學家之一大發明</p>
<p>時屆荷夏。蚊蟲蕃殖最易。擾人工作。侵人好夢。滋復可厭。我人苦無撲滅之法。乃今有美國康乃爾大學者。以新頴之捕蚊方法。貢獻我人。我人採此方法。則所有蚊蟲。不難完全撲滅。儘可安然工作。酣然濃睡矣。豈不快哉。湖沼之中。一有孑孓。卽爲蚊蟲蕃殖之處。然此種子孑孓。可利用養氣（酸素）撲捕。養氣一物。爲各種動物生活上不可或缺之物。乃今能殺蚊。不亦奇乎。嘗試地點。卽在康乃爾境。森林之内。有一池沼。自利用養氣殺蚊而後。蚊蟲當卽絶跡。已數年於茲矣。據云蚊蟲蕃殖之池沼中。必有水産植物一種。名Ｃhara者。生於水底。而蚊蟲之卵。卽寄生其上。旣而康乃爾大學馬孫博士及休門教授。又發現此種植物。一經蚊卵寄生。所有養氣泡卽可漸次消滅。是故母蚊瀉卵而後。此種植物。依然生長。孑孓不致産生。然枯死後、則蚊羣卽可因而蕃殖。卽此一端。可知養氣之有無。與蚊卵之繁殖。有相當之關係也。乃用玻璃缸若干。儲之以水。半則含有養氣泡。半則無之。缸中更置蚊蟲之食物。並將孑孑五十條。放入缸中。數日後。無養氣泡之缸中。蚊蟲依次化成。而有養氣泡者。孑孑完全死亡。久而久之。養氣之殺蚊率。竟達百分之百。可知養氣一物。足以殺蚊。現博士等正在作進一步之研究。俾可利用養氣泡。將池沼中之孑孑、完全殺除、俾蚊蟲無以生長。惟養氣殺蚊。原理何在。彼等尚無詳細之報告云。</p>
<h3>伍祐公園納凉記</h3>
<p>— 蟄存</p>
<p>盛夏納凉處所。固不必高堂大厦水榭風亭也。祇須於半村半郭間。拓地築屋。三分水二分竹而已。惟樹木以多多益善。坐嘯其中。覺幽潔而脫塵囂。最爲避暑佳境。伍祐公園。位於鎭之西北隅。近接串塲河西岸。而積約廣六七十畝。環以活潑淸流。而弓形之板橋通焉。上有橋亭。欄杆飾以靑白色。園門左右之樹隂。時拂及橋身。遠觀饒有畫意。樹以千計。多榆柳松槐之屬。高均逾數丈。繞園一周。相糾結不斷。中築松竹天三楹。偏於北面。以受南薰。距松竹天前數十武。有池一。中雜植菱蕖。西有墨安别墅。短樹成圍。若别爲一徑。内附有絲竹棋枰各消遣品。迤南有高埠。建亭其上。舊題曰醉翁亭。茲已改爲中山亭。登臨覽觀。遠近景物皆可數。園内道路環。夾道皆高樹。游人行其中如張蓋。幾忘紅塵道上有酷熱之苦。並酌劃數坵歸園丁耕種。覺花木中有農塲意。塵世中亦雅有山林意。柳子厚所謂視其植。則淸秀敷舒。視其蓄。則溶漾紆餘者是也。鄉人士近復有推廣建築提議。他日可益臻完美。予雖世爲本鎭人。懶於游覽。日前獨往一游。作小勾留。内並有出售茶點者。游客頗以爲便。予寂坐移時。長風忽來。四圍如起波濤聲、又如瀑布聲。又如溪灘聲。時與茶熟聲相和應。此際俗慮都消。恍入淸凉之國。當得句云。緣堤行徧倦於游。綠樹隂中作小留。魚鳥親人皆自得。時聞潑剌與勾輈。未幾至夕陽在山人影散亂之候。復留聯句云。名園時集名流。煑茗淸淡堪遠俗。佳境自饒佳趣。隔林閒步當登山。辛未六月之杪。歸而誌之。期不忘一時履綦之迹云爾。</p>
<h3>幾個問題</h3>
<p>— 美珥</p>
<p>有一個倫理學家出了幾個問題如下。「吃苦的爺娘生了個浪漫的兒子。却娶了一個賢淑的媳婦。這個家庭怎樣」。</p>
<p>「受着萬人崇拜的歌女。甲也願意娶伊。乙也願意娶伊。丙丁也願意娶伊。結果。伊應該選擇那一種人做伊的終身伴侣。」</p>
<p>「歌女千選萬揀。却選上了一個浪漫的少年。後來那個少年的原來的媳婦忽然跑上門來。請教怎樣對付。」</p>
<p>「一方面向情人海闊天空的說自己闊氣。却巧碰着自己的原來的妻子。又碰着自己的父親。在一個無可奈何的境界裏。究竟如何應付。」</p>
<p>「事實拆穿了。妻子知道伊的丈夫有外遇。伊又怎樣。」</p>
<p>「事實拆穿了。睛人知道伊所選中的人是個大混蛋。伊又怎樣。」</p>
<p>「人死了。事情便一了百了嗎。」</p>
<p>以上的許多問題。不是憑空想起來的。乃是産生在一件事實的上面。然而它的答案。决不是聰明的讀者所能想像得到的。現在天一影片公司爲了攝製第一張國産慕維通影片。就决定來解决這許多問題、表面上對於都市生活是掝寫得淋漓盡致。使人看了。不能不覺得新奇與熱閙。但是在骨子裏。它的教訓是値得給整個的中國人來看一看的。裏面的一個故事。究竟是諷刺着什麽駡什麽呢。在片中有着熱烈而悽傷的歌。又有浪漫而緊張的舞。又有動人的使人哭笑不得的曲折離奇的布局。雖然它開映還有待。它的名字是「歌塲春色。」値得我們記住了。等將來去看看它如何解决着上面的問題。</p>
<h3>印度遊記（七○）</h3>
<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>印度於明日起全印度教人過節兩日、今晚開會。男女齊集。舖毯席於地。先行散花圈禮。余亦有焉。上由班長領首念梵文古詩歌。焚木此於盆。澆以油。且澆且念。蓋事火之俗與。已而大隊學生唱歌。一生領之。先唱一聲。乃齊唱。其聲淸越而超脫。不知何歌也。和以鼓。已乃奏音樂。各人任意唱各種語言之鄉歌。亦請余爲吟中國詩。彼所甚好也。當余聞印度樂歌詩。不解其詞。而玩其音。大抵非中國可及。蓋美之本本於擅學。其佛梵之哲學。已高出人間。此播之爲樂歌。其音節高遠而超越。迴非人間境界可比。若中國者歌境界三百篇之雅頌爲極。不過王道。再上爲唐虞。至帝道而止。惟仙家能奏琴境殊超越。可比印度樂之一部分耳。乃其廣大幽邈。中國無此境界也。試聽僧人之唄歌。可使人神游他界矣。中國之楚詞若能播之樂歌。境界亦甚高。諸學生唱歌後。散糖食及行紅色點額禮。亦爲余點額。最後唱愛國歌而散。月明夜靜。景致殊美。教長納侖業沙祝亞洲文化聯合之成功。</p>
<p>會旣散。學生等乃聚談亞洲之將將來與甘地運動。甘地所受之稱號爲大雄。Ｍabatma與昔稱佛者同一字也。佛亦名大雄。學生云。據印度教人云。佛乃第九佛。甘地爲第十佛也。余乃問甘地之政策。及其人民已收之效力。學生云。吾印人無兵器。止有從經濟上致工夫。凡有三策。一爲不用外貨。每年所省已在數萬萬以上。英商大困。有要求英政府與印人以自由。以恢復貿易者。可見其窘也。二爲罷工。一切工程不與外人服役。英人一切事必須印人爲之。此事不易辦到。只做得一部。三爲抗稅。此事大不易。在近孟買之市名Ｇugrat者。爲甘地家鄉。努力於抗稅事。警察燒其房。殺其人。人乃棄田而逃。此事各地均運動。尚未大奏功。然警察均印人。漸呈惰工之象。卽兵士亦漸有惰象。久之得全體之同情。自生變化。有許多婦女小兒　。加入運動。總之遍地抗稅。英人捕不了許多。此策爲甚要。若能絶英人經濟來源。則兵隊不能養。政府之力漸弱矣。此甘地運動之策也。要之無論如何。吾印人至死必爭自由。非得自由不止也。</p>

<p>陸先生不很自然地吐出了他對人的應有的稱謂：「爸爸！媽媽！」隨手就把手裏提着的一簇香蕉遞向他母親的手邊。他母親是非常地快樂。伊瞧見伊的兒子是這樣地長成了，雖然祗離開了半年還不到的時間，但是好像有無窮的幸福給他帶了回來。他父親自然也非常地快樂，因爲他自己辛苦了大半世，一切的希冀全在他那個兒子的身上，平常時候，總默禱着他的兒子能夠用心讀書，將來好榮宗耀祖，光大門楣；現在他兒子從學校裏回來，雖然還没有到畢業，但是他的希冀却好像更進一步，更深了一層。</p>
<p>到了裏邊屋子裏，他的母親忙着把自己的衣襟揩抹了一隻椅子，呌他坐下；又忙着喊倒茶，泡水，買點心·伊對着他，懇摯地像招待一位貴客。一邊，他的父親也覺得不知說些什麽話好，祗胡亂地問問學校裏的情形：「功課忙不忙？同學多不多？……」</p>
<p>陸先生不但忘了他應該向他的父母問問「身體好不好」啊，「生意好不好」啊，而且他還忘了一個人，直到他瞧見了從裏邊竈間裏有人捧出一碗麵來的時候，他似乎呆住了。</p>
<p>同樣的驚奇，同樣的說；「小榮！是你回來了麽？」</p>
<p>他實在不願意看見這最後走出來的那個人，便是他已經結了婚三年的他的妻子。但是他會從鄙夷不屑的神情裏轉變出似乎很温柔的樣子，他說：「怎麽樣？你在家裡麽？」</p>
<p>「下了幾天雨，生意淸得很，兩天没有出去，想不到你倒回來了！」伊露出了最愉快的容色，好像伊已經從伊的丈夫身上得到了無限的慰安。</p>
<p>于是，伊也坐了下來，一碗麵從伊的手裏送到伊丈夫的面前，「你餓了吧！不夠的話，還有得添呢！」伊笑着說。</p>
<p>「嫌味兒太淡麽？要不要加姕醬油？」還是伊的殷勤的說話，一邊，伊立起身來，拿了一隻面盆，又去端了些水出來。</p>
<p>陸先生吃了一口，就不吃了。他說：「我飽得很，吃不下了！」</p>

<h3>公債交割洋交特旺</h3>
<p>▲釐價驟跌一釐餘午市回漲</p>
<p>▲市塲概况　金融界近年來鑒於市面之凋零、實業無可着手、紛紛從事於投機、兼投資之公債營業、故每屆月底交割時期、洋籌碼進出紛紜、大有與日俱增之概、昨日又爲例有之交割　日、對於七月份之期貨、均須交現、於是押欵及買買貨特須歸納淸結、是以洋交特别奇多、而厘價因以跌落也、</p>
<p>▲厘拆價格（洋厘）早市交易奇旺、競爭尤烈、結果賣戸擁擠、厘價驟跌一釐半有强、爲七錢二分三厘六毫二忽半、午市稍稍堅定、收盤價較早市改好半釐、而爲七錢二分四厘一毫二忽半、（銀拆）早午市均開六分、銀根形勢改鬆、劃頭加水遂無行市、而爲白劃、然中途尚有四五分市面、</p>
<p>▲輔幣市情　江南小洋、早市仍爲六錢五分、而午市跌小一厘、爲六錢四分九釐、做出交易、早市六千角、午市二千角、廣東小洋、早市爲六錢四分二厘、午市爲六錢四分二厘半、做出交易、早市十五萬角、午市五萬角、銅元又復加長一千五百文、爲三百八十一千文、如是則已超出八十千關外矣、</p>
<p>▲銀洋進出（銀欵）昨日銀行收解、以月底伊邇、各項結欵亟待疏理、而其票欵亦多、計華商收解票欵三百三十餘萬、外商二百三四十萬、結欵收解三百萬强弱、各種貨匯稅什諸欵收解一千三百二三十萬、出倉一百四十萬、日商銀行收解各欵五百四十餘萬、結欵七八十萬、進倉五十萬、錢莊銀公單收解四千八百餘萬、劃頭欵收解五百七十餘萬、各路匯欵一百十餘萬、收現八九十萬、（洋欵）匯劃票欵、早市做出六百十三萬五千、午市二百三十六萬五千、兩市共達八百五十萬之巨、鈔票早市七萬五千、午市十萬○五千、塲外鈔票、早市十九萬五千、午市十五萬五千、銀行交易、尤爲孔多、早市互市三百九十萬、午市一百九十五萬、各銀行洋戸往來收解四百四十餘萬、鈔票進出二百二三十萬、錢莊洋公單收解一千四百餘萬、洋劃頭欵收解六百三十餘萬、拆借洋欵進出二百三十餘萬、又銀行洋押欵交易三四百萬、小錢莊交易九十餘萬、至於客路去胃無聞、故厘市益覺羸弱、價格因以大跌</p>
<h3>證劵　七月期公債交割情形</h3>
<p>▲交割數共四千三百二十七萬</p>
<p>昨日本埠華商證劵交易因辦理七月份期貨交割、市塲交易暫停、查各債劵七月期貨交割數雖不及六月期之鉅、然亦達四千三百二十七萬元、内二○關仍佔一千一百數十萬、一九關七百八十萬、一九善·二○捲·裁兵·編遣亦均有四五百萬、内除於週二已先劃帳約有三千萬元、其於昨日實行交割者、仍有一千三百六十九萬元、其交割經過、頗稱順利、又今日證交照常開拍、同時並開始九月份期貨新買賣云　茲將各債七月期貨交割及劃帳數分列如後、（單位元）</p>

<h3>紗花　交割日之現紗花</h3>
<p>▲現紗走銷尚暢　紗市平靜、趨勢較堅、因實銷尚稱不惡、致人心帶緊、日紗較前爲活動、但期紗因本月底辦理交割停市、客帮全日買去統計九百五十包、同行中進二百五十包、行情漲二錢半、天津進一百包、靑島進一百包、内地帮進一百六十包、雲南帮進一百三十包、徐州進七十五包、廣東進五十包、汕頭進五十包、漢口進五十包、雜帮進一百五十包云、</p>
<p>▲現棉交易全無　期棉因月末交割停市、但現棉交易全無、而世界棉市、步步趨落、形勢甚虛、本埠市勢雖平靜、但一備特色可言、日前天時已轉晴正、而世界潮流復全向下游、一時恐未易轉機、</p>
<h3>外紗花仍少起色</h3>
<p>▲美印英棉價續跌　昨日美棉初因天氣良好及華爾街不振而疲、後因一部份空戸抵補略回、計期貨跌七至十磅音、現貨跌十磅音、英棉期現貨跌十五點、埃及棉現貨跌十五點、印棉市况暗淡、歐洲出口商售出、計平果爾跌五羅比、奥姆辣跌六·二五羅比、白羅溪跌六羅比、原電錄左、（二十九日瀚電）</p>

<h3>七月份標紗交割之經過</h3>
<p>▲交割價一百六十四兩……額九千一百包</p>
<p>七月份標紗本有上漲之力、因北路實需大批發展、人心良好、形勢步挺、詎料某商乘漲時大批賣出翻空、市面急轉直下、頗有不穩之勢、由一百六十二三兩跌至五十七兩外　足見大戸壓力之重、未幾萬寳山慘案發現、韓僑損害不少、對日經濟絶交、愛國運動日見熱烈、拒貨舉行、由此發生、市上現紗市况大爲緊俏、價略步漲、四十二支細紗狂漲數十兩、於是人心震動、投機家蜂擁而來、商塲上買氣瀰漫、漲風益烈、又穿出六十兩關外、最高曾見一百六十四兩六錢、但某廠商依然賣出、惟另一商廠逢低購進做多、雙方勢相匹敵、最後一盤呌價喊至五兩、後以大戸賣出又低、結果爲四兩、交割價爲一百六十四兩、殘餘九千一百包、實行交割四千五百包、其餘爲自行交割、計十支紅奎星一百包、彩奎星一千五百包、金鷄五十包、鴻福九百包、三羊一千三百五十包、實彝七百包、地球一百包、富貴五十包、紅荷蜂二百包交收兩方均係廠商、茲將各號及包額分錄於後、</p>

<h3>七月份漢標交割概况</h3>
<p>▲交割價卅八兩……額三萬零一百担</p>
<p>七月份漢標在月初市氣、異常軟化、蓋以海外棉市虛疲不振、而金價亦盤旋不定、致人心愈軟、各廠實需滯鈍、全無消化、且紗市趨落、故市面遂呈徘徊之局、在三十八九兩之間、但日商在多頭地位拖進、仍不放鬆、後以紗價不良、美棉不穩、跌破九分關門、人氣一度虛風、最低三十七兩二錢、嗣以日商收貨、市盤稍回、結果最後一盤價爲三十八兩、交割價三十八兩、殘餘三萬零一百担、貨品陜西及火機花兩種、交貨愼昌六千六百担、恒益四千一百担、新享二千五百担爲最多、收貨公泰七千三百担、天隆一千五百担、榮興一千八百担爲最多、茲將各號及担額、分錄於後、</p>

<h3>糧食　常錫北粳喊起半元</h3>
<p>▲上棧囤積之故、</p>
<p>▲新閘　昨日内地來船、計無錫·江隂·常州·宜興·同里·石浦·西塘等十七八號、市上交易初呆後活、常錫北粳略有上棧、約計二三千擔、行情喊起五角、早晚稻隨到隨銷、故趨勢拔緊三角、通變隂化二種開盤坐定、蘆洋尖及埠尖、去化滯細、市形高料緣洋米尚疲、跟低角許、</p>
<p>▲南市　昨日各帮來源接而不多、内平湖·南港帮居多、城鄉店銷不見活絡、厚粳到銷二淡、價照原盤、薄稻祇到五六號、寗銷不活、本街去路略有、價無漲跌、蘆洋尖胃淡、價低一二角、洋米據云接濟軍糧、故有動辦、價則硬起半元、</p>
<h3>交割前粉市形勢嚴重</h3>
<p>昨日粉市形勢仍甚嚴重、本月份因祇一天交易、業外空頭、不得不隨勢抵補、廠家因現貨可以喊高、不願多交、二十九號未軋空、買戸則態度甚堅、遠期各月份以内地帮依然爭購不已、最高時較前日又漲起二分外、旋因福新·阜豐·信大等廠均有抛出、跌落一分零、惟較之前日收盤、則仍見優勝也、結果本月份較前日漲二分半、八月份大一分七釐半、九月份大一分、十月份大一分半、十一月份大一分二釐半、十二月份大五釐半、</p>
<h3>期麥晨漲午跌</h3>
<p>因傳洋麥續有定成三四船</p>
<p>現麥到貨不多喊高三四分</p>
<p>昨日蜞有麥上午開盤後、各月份市面、天時雖致吸收、近遠期較前日又好三四分不等、迨至下午開盤、各月份開價、又復猛落、因傳某某兩大廠、已續定澳洲三號麥三四船、合價四兩二錢六分、致人心衝突、紛紛回跌、九月份較上午最高價、計落九分之巨、照此種情形、故若標準過分抬價、實予洋麥來華增多機會也、結果八月份較前日跌二分、九月份跌六分、十月份跌三分、十一月份跌一分、十二月份未動、現麥因到貨不多、産區亦步步高漲、各檔又喊高三四分不等、結果雙鳳麥三兩六錢八分、次至三兩五錢半、三兩五錢九分、丹陽麥三兩七錢、計二千五百包、由福新華豐信大辦去云、</p>
<h3>七月期豆軋空風潮暫息</h3>
<p>▲照五兩四錢半結價</p>
<p>大連黄豆、本須拍至昨日、惟本月份因軋空關係、故前日已經停拍、多頭方面、經理事及有關之經紀人商酌、所有空戸、均以五兩四錢半結價、聞此番之軋空、初非有意、實因收貨者聞係廠家、空戸則全係外行、以無貨可交、祇好無形暗損云、</p>
<h3>絲茶　珍眉綠茶交易暢旺</h3>
<p>昨日婺源屯溪等路珍眉綠茶、英法兩莊、均起搜辦、交易異常旺盛、市盤亦較前略爲堅挺、現下市上低莊珍眉、業已銷售無幾、上中莊貨、亦不過萬餘箱、華茶商態度堅硬、市價有看漲之勢、針眉秀眉兩項、存底枯薄、售價續漲三四兩、惟貢熙一項、俄莊仍未動辦、白頭莊去胃不大、綠茶頗受影響云、</p>
<h3>華絲商一致拒用日繭</h3>
<p>今歲江浙各屬春夏二蠶、收成均告奇歡、各埠絲廠原料、早具不敷繅製、類均提倡農民飼育秋蠶、以補不足、而日商以該國今歲繭産仍豐、繭價不廉、咸將大批日繭運華兜售、自對日經濟絶交羣起該日商分將存儲横濱等埠之大宗日繭、乘機運滬無出售、如我國絲商愛國心切、業已議决一致拒用日繭、是以邇來日繭、竟至無人過問、結果勢將仍運回日、抑或轉運他國銷售云、</p>
<h3>洋莊絲銷無生氣</h3>
<p>昨日海外市場、華絲有行無市、去電不轉、市氣呆滯、昨祇信孚等進白乾經十五包、美大等進黄粗絲八包、價均堅定云、</p>
<h3>疋頭　粗布逐步上漲</h3>
<p>▲東貨逐日仍有裝出……售價反漲</p>
<p>▲本廠布　連日上漲甚速、良以抵制日貨、日見緊張、華貨銷路驟形暢達、尤以粗布最爲堅昂、昨九磅布五兩二錢出關、十磅藍鷄已達五兩五錢、十一磅貨怡和之三鹿·三兎·三貓均五兩七錢半、十六磅之五鶴、牡丹俱八兩一錢以外、細布華貨甚缺、細斜紋金城已售八兩二錢半、蝶球七兩七錢半、但日廠貨之細布·細斜亦絲毫未跌、蓋滬上雖已實行檢查、外埠尚未抵制、交易依然不少也、</p>
<p>▲東西疋　昨日西貨之呌莊貨俱漲三四錢不等、惟市上普通花色異常缺乏、故東貨暗中依然活動、連日裝運出口者不少、貨價非特未跌、反有上漲之勢、昨月華絨長江帮運去甚夥、大柄絨二錢四分七厘半、中柄二錢三分七厘半、黑花斷檔、印花直貢呢大有無處搜羅之概、雙軍人細斜已十兩出關、直貢呢·直貢緞倘有現貨者、逐日均有裝出、故觀察後步、一時間頗難下落云、</p>
<h3>五金　馬口鐵暢銷烟草公司</h3>
<p>昨日馬口鐵交易忽見暢達、如烟草公司、近日忽大見收辦、故標準頓呈漲風、計九十磅英貨售十四兩五錢、一百磅十六兩、美貨九十磅十六兩、一百磅十七兩、二百磅三十兩零七錢半、聞昨市開出有一千六七百箱之多云、</p>

<h3>長江航運現狀</h3>
<p>▲奸商偷裝日本貨</p>
<p>▲長沙帮統裝華輪</p>
<p>▲奸商私運日貨　自二十四日各輪公司實行拒裝日貨以來、本埠存儲之日本疋頭尚夥、未能載赴長江各埠、乃近日滬上有專營日貨之某商行、異想天開、將此項大宗日本洋布、完全委托日本報關行代報、並裝運日輪出口、在到達目的地時、亦由日商名義提取、然後私交與奸商、如此、則可避檢查員之耳目、每件給手續費若干、日人自然樂爲之辦、又鑒於前天盧陽公貨在駁船中扣去、故昨日起、奸商之運裝日貨而用駁船者、在駁船上均揷日本國旗、藉以表示拒查、致邇日東洋疋頭之往長江與南北洋者、出口額仍屬不少也、</p>
<p>▲長沙客貨擁擠　近日華商江輪上水赴漢、本埠運往之長沙客貨、甚爲擁擠、其原因有二、（一）自抵制以來、湘省各客帮業已拒裝日輪、（二）上年其黨至長沙時、英商怡和洋行之貨棧被燒、客貨被焚、近百萬元、此項損失、由客家向怡和索賠、而未經允可、湘省各客家、乃一致拒運該行之商輪現時統裝中國輪舶、故招商三北等之湖南去貨、十分擁擠、</p>
<p>▲貨物不再存棧　漢口大水淹没各貨棧、已兩記本報、現在水勢雖漸退、但各貨棧之浸水者、尚未能退凈、而各輪公司正在設法搬移至高地、惟連日中央美商各江輪、因車糖麥粉等之大宗貨物到漢者、均不能着水、蓋各該貨件入水卽化者、昨日由各輪局議定辦法、凡貨棧没水之各局、輪船抵漢時、貨物不再存棧、通告客家、改用駁船卸儎、其費用則由客家自任、俟水退時再復原狀、</p>
<p>▲滬潯貨物亦阻　上海往九江之貨、轉赴内地及南昌者居多、來貨亦然、昨日滬上各輪接得潯電、言南潯路已被大水阻斷、贛中貨物來去均受阻碍、且棧房不能存儲、躉船已經裝足、故進出口客貨、均受阻滯影響矣、</p>
<h3>怡和海員暫容減薪</h3>
<p>上海泰晤士報云、怡和公司與海員雙方間、因減薪問題、引起緊引局勢、業已數星期、茲經中國沿海西人海員公會開會議定、鑒於目下營業艱難、爲顧全大局計、暫不强迫公司容納海員要求、業由該會於昨日函覆公司、願暫時仍照現行減薪辦法、領受薪水、因此該問題已暫告一段落矣、</p>

<p>（一）總論（甲）本研究的起源、我國的勞工立法、其歷史甚短、關於工廠部份、在民國十一年時、農商部以部令公布工廠暫行通則、民國十八年冬、立法院公布工廠法、我們覺得有幾處地方、從者勝於前者、遣亦表示我國勞工立法的進步、不過對於國民政府的工廠法、各方面近來發生許多議論、或以爲該法立意至善、目的在保護工人及促進實業的發展、亟宜實行、或以爲該法近於理想、有幾條於實情相差太遠、須經修改、然後可以施行、實際這些意見的可靠程度如何、非有事實的研究不能斷定、民國二十年二月、民生改進研究會（基督教協進會主催）在上海開會時、對於我國工廠法、有熱烈的討論、其結果通過議案一則、主張以公正不偏的態度、作事實的研究、併約著者担任此種工作、因時間人才與經濟的關係、著者以上海市爲初步的研究、雖然、欲明事實的眞相、非以全國爲範圍不可、但上海市是工商業特别發展的區域、是中外工廠最多的區域、所以上海市的研究、當然比他市爲重要、由上海市的研究、可以看出工廠法實行程度的概况、當研究工作開始之時、卽由好幾個機關合作和贊助、在中國方面、有工商管理協會、在外國方面、有雇主協會、其他贊助者、尚有政府機關（如南京統計局·工商訪問局·中央研究院·上海市社會局·等）公共機關及工會等、我們非常心感、（乙）本研究的範圍、著者從事規定調查表格一種、中文方面、由調查員五人、分往二百廠家塡寫、外國方面、用英文日文二種、由雇主協會、以通信法徵求答案、實行調查、約一個月竣事、此外尚有與各方面談話、如政府職員中外籍雇主六十餘人、（外籍雇主、大半由邢德女士ＭissE·Ｍ·Ｈinder担任）、工會領袖十飯人、男女童工十餘人、所以本研究大致根據於事實的分析、計得華籍工廠一七六家、外籍工廠五二家、凡男工五一九六○人、女工一零四一人、童</p>

<p>上表是本研究的總結束、由此可得結論如下、（一）本研究以事實相差尚遠、窒碍難行、（二）但　者以爲工廠法是社會改良必需的法律、我們必需向這一個方面努力　（三）因此我們應以工廠法爲目的、但在達到這個目的之先、我們必須找尋入門之路、著者不揣冒昧、以爲幾條建議、是入門之路、因爲這些建議、是以事實爲根據、并且是向工廠法一面走的、如果這些建議、是入門之路、那末我們可以把工廠法分期施行、有現時可以施行的條文、有一年以後二年以後或三年以後可行的條文、今簡述如下、工廠法的施行程序、（甲）立卽施行者、（一）工廠紀錄、（子）工廠依照工廠法、舉辦紀錄删除工人品行·技能·工作效率·及疾病原因、（丑）此項紀錄、供工廠檢查員、隨時查閱之用、（寅）工廠於每年年終、向政府報告一次、報告内容、爲紀錄的摘要、（卯）於紀錄内增加災害報告一項、（二）幼年工、凡滿十二歲的男女、身高若干尺、（由調查後决定標準）、經醫生查騐身體合格者、發給雇傭證、此項醫生、由政府任用之、（三）休息日、每月二日、（不給資）（四）工作時間、每日十小時、（或每晝夜二十小時）本條不適用於下列各項、（甲）有季節性的工業、（但絲業不在例外）、（乙）工業中其機器工作有繼續性、不能停止者、（用列舉法）（丙）專用男工者、（丁）遇天災或特别事變、（五）津貼及撫卹、（子）傷害及亡死各條照原文、（丑）加工業疾病的津貼、（工業疾病須有定義）（寅）删除疾病賠償、（六）放假日、國定例假、每年八日、給資、（七）安全與衞生、一俟比較切實的條文公布後、立卽實行、（八）藝徒、照原文、（九）奬金、工廠於年終給奬金、至少等於工資百分之四、（十）勞資討論機關、（工廠會議）爲謀勞資親善起見、雙方各舉代表、討論關於勞資各項問題、上述各項、有經濟關係者、僅三項、卽（子）十小時工作制、（丑）每年放假八日、（寅）奬金、所以對於立卽施行、似無重要困難、（乙）一年以後施行者、在工廠服務一年以上的女工、如遇生産、並經醫生證實者、给予休假日四星期、並給資、（丙）二年以後施行者、（一）幼年工每日工作八小時、（二）幼年工與藝徒、每日教育二小時、（丁）三年以後施行者、女工與幼年工、不準作深夜工、三年以後、將工廠法全部從詳討論、（戊）五年以後施行者、（一）休息日每月四日、（二）提高幼年工的年齡、（三）增加婦女工廠檢查員、（己）暫緩施行的條文、（一）工資、（二）特别休息日、（三）作契約、（四）疾病津貼、（五）工廠會議、爲什麽工廠法要分期施行呢、其主因有二、（一）工廠法施行、對於工業有經濟担負、（如縮短工作時間、禁止女工童工作深夜工、休息與休假、産母卹金等、）如果這幾條同時實行、恐工業不能担負、我國的實業現在處於危險地步、對外有國際競爭對内有管理與勞工各種困難、如再加以較重的經濟担負、勢難發展實業、因此我們主張、將工廠法分期施行、譬如第一年對於縮短工作時間、工業要受損失的、因此將産母卹金於第二年施行、餘類推、（二）工廠法裏、有幾條其施行必須有準備的、譬如禁止女工與幼年工的深夜工、在目下是辦不到的、因爲棉紡·棉織·繅絲·絲織·各業用大批的女工與幼年工、如果驟然禁止、這些工業、將有極大的困難、所以我們主張於工廠法施行三年之後、廢除女工與幼年工的深夜工、末了、入門之路、須由何處起首呢、我們旣以工廠法爲目標、所以工廠法不必修改、施行條例、是根據於工廠法的、所以亦不必修改、起首點就在實業部部令、關於某某條文的暫時辦法、可以部令規定之、因爲工業與勞工的情形、時有變遷、所以部令亦可隨之而變、這似乎是最富於彈性的辦法、如此工廠法是改良社會的目標、實業部部令是實現這種目標的入門之路的起首點、</p>

<h3>鄰居</h3>
<p>— 珂</p>
<p>正吃過了夜飯、大家都圍繞着飯桌在談笑、</p>
<p>「請問先生們、江先生在家吧、」玻璃窗門上映着一個女人的面孔、</p>
<p>室裏的燈光眩耀、這站在黑暗裏的女人面孔、只能顯出一個輪廓、彷彿她背後還有一個男人的影子、</p>
<p>「江先生叹、他住在隔壁裏面哩、」我姊姊答說、</p>
<p>她聽說謝了一聲、便走到隔壁去了、一十、飯室裏的門輕輕地掩開、談和一個三十多歲的身材矮小眼露凶光的男人走進來、</p>
<p>「江先生出去了、這地址、謝謝你　、神交給他、等他回來的時候、」</p>
<p>她浮腫慘白的臉上、露出謙遜的微笑、伸出那鷄爪般的手、從男人的手裏、接過一張寫好了的條子、放在桌上、向我姊姊說、</p>
<p>她的年紀似乎也在三十上下、頭髮蓄得很長、光亮地向腦後梳着、耳邊夾着一個廉價部買的水鑽鬆夾、、旗袍長闊、走路時下擺不住地幌動、男人穿着白紗長衫、時時用手撫摸額上鬈曲着的短髮、眼睛疾迅地向四周閃動、</p>
<p>「多謝你、答應我的請求、」那男人說着眼光又打了一個周遭、「不要客氣罷、」姊姊笑着答應了、他們謙遜地走出去、</p>
<p>「唔、張先、聽口音像是同鄉哩、」我在桌上拾起那張紙條來、</p>
<p>第二天早上、太門外轟隆隆地車子響、人聲嘈雜、我走到樓窗邊探望、祇見昨晚的兩夫妻帶着好多的小孩·箱子·傢具·拖拖沓沓地搬來了、</p>
<p>最大的男孩子、大約在十歲左右、拖着一雙破鞋子、赤裸了上身、兩條像枯枝般的小臂膊、整日地抱着一個頭上滿了瘡癤的吃乳的嬰兒、在他疲備的眼光瘦削的臉頰上、像是永遠不會有童年活耀的歡愉、</p>
<p>我姊姊站在飯堂門口、</p>
<p>「天氣眞不好、儘是落雨啊、」新搬來的女人似乎是在對我姊姊打招呼、把手裏正抱着那吃乳的嬰兒、</p>
<p>她的衣襟廠開、坦露着凹陷的胸膛、顯現着一種爲生活疲勞的頽喪、</p>
<p>「是的、這樣不斷地落下去、今年怕會荒年哩、」姊姊靠近她些接着說、</p>
<p>「府上是那里、是Ｘ省吧、」</p>
<p>「不錯、我先生是Ｘ省人、我是四川人、」</p>
<p>「這兩位、都是令郎吧、」那最大的孩子剛剛走來抱那吃乳的嬰兒、我姊姊問、</p>
<p>「是的、那三個、都不是我生的、因爲我先生還有一房家眷哩、」　　她向站在大門口的三個齬齪孩子努了努嘴、</p>
<p>「怎麽、没有看見那一位呀　、」</p>
<p>「她、新生了小兒、在做産婦哩、」</p>
<p>「現在有什麽貴幹、張先生、」姊姊問</p>
<p>「他嗎、從前做過營長、後來又在許多機關上辦過事、又在……」她高興地說着、忽然張先生從外面回來、對她瞟了一眼、她慢慢地把話頭收住、默然的走進自己房裏去了、</p>
<p>他們一共是十個人、夫妻三個、六個小孩、一個娘姨、一起都住在一間廂房裏、我們如其是站在飯堂門口、便可以完全地看得見他們房裏的陳設、</p>
<p>靠窗擺着一張白木的長條桌、對牆是一張黑油油的方桌和兩條缺了伏手的破木椅、裏邊隱隱的擺了幾張雜亂着的小鐵床、房裏是汚穢、凌亂、</p>
<p>張先生正在忙着掛一張東西、掛在靠牆的黑油油主桌中間的牆上、他慢慢地用手往下擺放、漸漸地現出總理的半身遺像來、</p>
<p>「底下該是遺囑了、」我想、</p>
<p>他又把一張藍色紙軸釘在遺像的下面、丨眞的是遺囑、那末兩傍呢、應該是—「革命尚未成功、同志仍須努力」—這對聯了、</p>
<p>的確、他都照樣掛好、不過、没有黨國旗交叉着、</p>
<p>一天、我們正在吃午飯、隔壁的廂房裏發出一種謾駡的腔調、</p>
<p>「要吃什麽呢、這樣的菜不適口嗎、不吃、不吃就算了、」</p>
<p>張先生坐在靠窗的桌子邊、面前擺着皮蛋燻魚、一碗熱騰騰的紅燒肉、一個玻璃酒杯、杯裏滿注着深黄色的酒、一邊慢慢地呷着酒、一邊眼望着裏面駡、但、並不像是生氣、像是從容的閒適的一種消遣一樣、</p>
<p>「知道呢、吃什麽、自己吃魚吃肉喝酒、」她咳嗽了兩聲、吐了一口痰、又說道、「我們娘子們却只是這一樣鹹淹菜、穿的、用的、那一件不是我帶來的、你這没有良心的人呵、」</p>
<p>「良心、什麽良心、有良心也不再嫁了、」張先生冷笑了一聲、</p>
<p>「這、這是……」嗓童漸漸地低沉了、「没良心的人呵、當初是怎樣地引誘、欺騙、現在却……」她是在哭了、聲音糢糊到不可分辨、</p>
<p>「算了吧、這算一回事哩、吵嘴總没有好話說的、」娘姨温聲地勸說、</p>
<p>「我們常是這麽吵的、無論在什麽地方、都是這樣、」張先生像是很得意的說、</p>
<p>「你不要管這閒事罷、最好、」</p>
<p>眞的、張先生搬了六七天、已經閙過十多次了、</p>
<p>雨雖已停住、屋檐上的溜水依舊是滴答滴答地響着、七月底的天氣、和深秋一樣的凉快、我正在看一本新譯的囂俄的戲戲、隔壁又照例的吵起來、</p>
<p>起初聲音低微到聽不淸楚、漸漸地聲音大了、</p>
<p>「不要臉的、你應該知道、你是怎樣地無恥喲、」張先生大聲地嚷、</p>
<p>「對的、不要臉、無恥、反正我是不要臉呀、騙我的東西、騙我家裏没有女人、這是要臉嗎、</p>
<p>「土匪、你這土匪、」</p>
<p>這一次、不像以前那樣容易平靜了、越閙越沸騰起來、</p>
<p>「土匪、誰是土匪」張先生厲聲的問、</p>
<p>「你、你便是土匪」</p>
<p>「好、拿證據出來、」</p>
<p>「拐女人、騙錢財、不是土匪　、證據、」她尖銳地笑了一聲、「我便是現實的證據、」</p>
<p>語音未歇、拍的一聲響、女人便大哭起來、</p>
<p>「你打我、你敢打我、來罷、」砰、像是女人撞倒的聲音、</p>
<p>「賤貨、打你、打你便怎樣、」劈拍劈拍、不斷地嚮着、</p>
<p>「打死人拉、救命喲、……」女人嘶聲的喊、</p>
<p>産婦頭上紮着黑縐巾、面色靑黄、驚懼的眼光時時向窗外探望、</p>
<p>不知怎的、被女人掙脫了、她拼命地往門外跑、像被捉住的鼠子脫離了貓兒的膏吻般、</p>
<p>「土匪、看、我去警署裏報告、你……」她一邊喊着、唉唉撞撞地向弄口奔去、</p>
<p>「怎麽、儘管拖牢我、却讓她跑去警署裏、這可能叹、她、她會對我不利啊、張先生往左邊一推、向右邊一聳、要掙脫拉住他的江先生的手、終於被他推開了圍住了他的人、飛一般地在女人背後追趕上去、這時弄堂裏看熱閙的人漸漸多了、大夥地跟在後面跑、</p>
<p>天空黑暗得像　一般、四邊佈滿了濃雲、剛剛落過雨的地上、一坑一坑的泥水在石板上蓄積着、被許多脚步踐過、發出「咕」「咕」的響聲、泥水向四面噴射、像噴泉的飛沬一般、</p>
<p>才在泥淖裏跑過去的一夥人又跑回來了、這趟是在主角的前面跑、</p>
<p>「回去就給打死了啊、我、我不回去、」</p>
<p>女人極力的掙扎、　衣服的襟領撕開了一條下裂縫、半邊大襟拖到膝蓋上、籌出屍骨般的胸脯、</p>
<p>張先生一聲不響、緊緊地咬着牙根、</p>
<p>一手揑住她的雙手、一手揮開衆人迅疾地直往裏跑、</p>
<p>女人不自任地給拖着走、脚像浮在地上一樣、拖進了大門、她尖聲地慘呌起來、</p>
<p>「不、不進去、死也在外面、」</p>
<p>張先生依舊不做聲、儘着用力的往裏拖、眼光射出殺人般的凶燄、像鬥瘋狂了的半一樣的可怕、</p>
<p>「救命啊、進去就打死了……不、不進去、救命啊……」</p>
<p>女人像殺猪般的喊呌、整個身軀投在泥水裏、從飯堂裏透出來的電燈光、射到她的散亂的頭髮、浮腫的眼眶、塗着血汚的面孔上、像被雨水冲洗過的泥菩薩一般、</p>
<p>一般憤怒的熱氣、像要冲破我的胸膛、腦　、我不自抑地衝口嚷道、「打、打、打這欺侮女性的、」</p>
<p>這突然的喊聲像電閃般地通過了大夥人的面液、立刻燃着了他們藴伏着的火燄、一齊和敲打崖石的浪潮般汹湧地向張先生責罰、張先生看見大家對他都帶有仇恨的敵意、他才鬆了手、臉上露着不自然的獰笑說道、</p>
<p>「没有什麽、没打她、諸位請放心、」</p>
<p>…………………………</p>
<p>「先生們、聽他呢、他這欺謊的人、他、打得我庆麽殘酷、你們看、」她慢慢地從地上爬起、掀起褲脚和袖口來、靑紫色的創痕、斑斑剥剥地佈滿了她筋骨凸現的四肢上、她又喘着說道、</p>
<p>「先生們、他好狠心啊、我給他打成病、常常地吐血、評評公道看、先生們、該不該這樣、他……」</p>
<p>「啊、怎的、這樣地殘酷、」一個中年男子搖着頭說、</p>
<p>「相打、女人總要弱些、但、男人應該有點良心呀、」住在前面屋子裏的邱家嫂嫂說、</p>
<p>「我也做了丈夫、却從不曾這樣的對待過女人、」</p>
<p>「是的、男人都像他、世界上的女人怕不打絶了種、」</p>
<p>「啊、眞少見、這樣凶的人、」</p>
<p>「……………………」</p>
<p>「他……西……」女人傷心地哭着繼續說　　「好了、不要亂說罷、隣舍們被我們吵夠了、」張先生低聲對她說又笑着招呼大家道、</p>
<p>「對不起、吵閙了、我很懊悔呢、諸位也請歇歇吧、」</p>
<p>看熱閙的人見事情已經平和下來、感到平淡乏味、便一　　的散開了、</p>
<p>女人被張先生帶嚇帶哄的拉進房去、夜裏確是没有再打過、但那女人却嗚嗚咽咽和鬼哭般地哭了一整夜、</p>
<p>第二天隔壁廂房裏空洞洞地、顯現着一種寂靜的情調、以後再没有看他們了、</p>
<p>後來、聽隔壁的二房東丨卽張先生的朋友江先生丨說、</p>
<p>她一個寡婦、丈夫死後、遺了些財産、和一個孩子、張先生因爲與她死去丈夫有朋友的關係、便趁機竭力的引誘、說他做過營長、家裏怎樣有錢、還没有娶妻、他怎樣虔誠地愛她、并且、永遠是熱烈地愛着—但是、後來把她的財物用完、就常常借了一點小事毆打、這一次、聽說只是爲了她要買四個銅板白糖的事情、</p>

<p>Local officials cannot be held responsible.</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the case of the disappearance of British student Towne朋, Lambourn presented a memorandum from the British government to Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting yesterday. The latter replied that such incidents occur because of the failure to renounce extraterritorial rights. Towne originally lived in the Shanghai concession, but entered the Chinese mainland without presenting his passport to the local authorities for inspection. The local officials were not aware of his identity, so the local officials cannot be held responsible for protecting his safety. If extraterritorial rights are renounced and passports are presented for inspection upon arrival in China, then all responsibility rests with the local authorities. Lambourn had nothing else to say. However, the British side said that when Lambourn was about to leave, Wang Zhengting had promised to send a friendly letter to the Jiangsu Provincial Government to inquire on his behalf.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Advocating National Arts</h3>
<p>If you want to strengthen the country, first strengthen the race. If you want to strengthen the race, then you should first strengthen the people. Our country has been weak to this day. Foreign aggressions are rampant. There are various reasons for this, but the lack of healthy bodies among the people, all languishing like sick men, and even the premature death of many people, resulting in the weakening of the race, is the biggest reason. With healthy people, there will be a healthy race. With a healthy body, there will be a healthy will. A weak race is subject to natural elimination. A weak will leads to stagnation and cannot be revitalized. Therefore, a weak country starts with a weak people, and a strong country must start with a strong people. Our country is in a weak position today. If we want to revitalize, then we must strengthen the people's physique, so that everyone is strong and healthy, and wash away the shame of being the sick man of the East. This is essential.</p>
<p>Our country's ancient boxing and martial arts are simple in method, and they benefit the body equally. The samurai spirit is derived from this. The people of our country are accustomed to this way, and its history is extremely deep. Even today, the people in various places still practice it in their spare time. If we actively restore and promote this way, then its benefits to our race and our country will be great.</p>
<p>Mr. Sun Yat-sen once said, "Chinese boxing and martial arts have the same effect as Western airplanes and cannons. Restore and promote them." His intention was definitely not to preserve national essence, but to consider its advantages and disadvantages. For our national conditions, this is indeed a more effective and practical approach.</p>
<p>Recently, Mr. Zhang Zhijiang and Mr. Niu Yongjian of the Central Guoshu Institute initiated the establishment of Guoshu schools to train Guoshu teachers.</p>
<p>To make it popular among the people, to lay the foundation for strengthening our race is an excellent intention. The people of the country should give them support and help them succeed. However, as soon as one thing is accomplished, a drawback arises. The benefits of national arts to our country and our race are great, but if the teachers and students do not have a correct understanding of this, or a far-reaching understanding, and only see it as a tool for bravery and aggression, or are limited to old methods and cannot incorporate new scientific methods, then the drawbacks will be great. The reporter would like to offer a few points based on what he has seen.</p>
<p>(1) The advocacy of national arts does not value the creation of a few outstanding experts. It is especially important to avoid fostering a spirit of bravery and aggression. It must be based on the pure meaning of strengthening the physique and seek its popularization. All schools across the country should also have this subject in order to achieve practical results.</p>
<p>(2) The views of sectarianism and factionalism are self-defeating and lose the original meaning of strengthening the physique. They should be eliminated as soon as possible. (3) Practicing national arts seeks to strengthen the body, not to improve skills. It does not focus on personal honor. Therefore, the practice of competitive martial arts and the pursuit of trophies endanger lives in order to gain personal honor. The drawbacks are great and should be corrected as soon as possible.</p>
<p>(4) Old methods are often unscientific. Today's practice should be combined with scientific knowledge to make it suitable for hygiene. As for other methods of using brute force to compress the body to seek the special development of its parts, it should be corrected.</p>
<p>In short, the advocacy of national arts is not to preserve national essence, nor is it solely for fighting. Its only purpose is to cultivate healthy citizens. If we proceed with this pure purpose, we will not cause drawbacks.</p>

<h3>Salt Tax Treasury Bonds Relieve Financial Difficulties</h3>
<p>Salt merchants on each shore are willing to underwrite the bonds.</p>
<p>The new salt law is difficult to implement.</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The new budget is more than 170 million, which are eleven administrative expenses. As for military expenses, based on the current standing divisions and military organs, it is 27 million per month and 300 million per year. Local security police and the navy are not included. Before the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee last year, military expenses accounted for 90 percent of the annual income. It was resolved at the Fourth Plenary Session to expedite reorganization and reduce it to 60 percent. Later, there were more troops retained for the aftermath of the North, plus the rampant Jiangxi bandits and the major armies' suppression, although there were no major increases in troops, the original budget was not reduced. In addition, the military expenses required by the armies suppressing the Red Army during the march are twice as much as the peacetime military pay. Therefore, the expenditure on military expenses and military pay this year should be more than 400 million. According to the government's national tax revenue this year, customs duties are estimated at more than 200 million taels, totaling more than 300 million yuan, salt tax is 120 million, and tobacco, alcohol, and stamps are 50 million yuan, totaling less than 500 million yuan. The total expenditure must be more than 600 million yuan. Therefore, there is no real funding under the administrative expenses of the new budget. As for the customs duty treasury bonds of the 19th year of the Republic, totaling 10 million, in addition to the military expenses required, the remaining amount is to repay the previous 80 million unified tax treasury bonds. Although the mortgage has a surplus, it is offset by the overdrafts of various banks. Today, the 80 million salt tax public bonds were still denied by the Minister of Finance a month ago, especially because the annual accounts</p>
<p>Deficit, I had to come out with this. At this time, the new salt law has not yet been implemented, so it can still be handled. Salt merchants on each shore are willing to underwrite the bonds and it is not difficult to sell them out. However, in order to ensure the reliability of the guarantee, the Ministry of Finance intends to declare that free trade and on-site taxation will not be implemented before the principal and interest of these treasury bonds are cleared. Recently, salt merchants on each shore asked the Salt Administration that since the new salt law has been promulgated, merchants do not seem to need to transport it again. The ministry approved that the new salt law is difficult to implement, and the merchants should continue to transport it as before and do not listen to rumors in order to benefit the national treasury.

<h3>Fengtai Red Cross Branch Telegram</h3>
<p>To Shanghai Shen Bao and Please Forward to All Newspapers: All charity groups are requested to note that after the eastern day of July in our town, mountain floods erupted, like a soaring dragon. The waves were turbulent, and everything in its path was reduced to ruins. Over a hundred miles of the county was turned into a swamp, and tens of thousands of lives were buried in the belly of fish. Some entire villages and cities were unable to escape and went with the waves, and some entire families of several people joined hands and went to the vast ocean. Overall, in the entire county, houses were completely washed away, and the number of deaths is countless. Such a tragic disaster is rarely seen in history. Even those who were fortunate enough to escape are mostly on the verge of death. Even if they escape the water, it is difficult to escape hunger and cold. If no measures are taken to provide relief, they will inevitably fill the ditches. We have always admired the compassion of all great benefactors. Now that they have drowned and are hungry, we earnestly request that you publish them in newspapers to broaden the appeal for donations. We will offer our silent prayers with utmost sincerity.

<h3>A Study of Korean Migration to the Northeast</h3>
<p>(Continued from the 8th) Bin</p>
<p>(4) The Persecution of the Northeast Caused by Korean Migration</p>
<p>As described in the previous chapter, it can be seen that under the command of Japanese imperialist colonial policies, Koreans are actively migrating to our Northeast, which is flourishing. The huge amount of current migration, the broad distribution area, and the complexity of occupations, coupled with the use and direction of the Japanese, have all given our Northeast infinite persecution. Briefly described as follows.</p>
<p>(1) Seizing the Benefits of Paddy Fields - The harvest of paddy fields and dry fields in the Northeast is about 3 to 5 and 10, respectively. Koreans are best at planting paddy fields. Therefore, in various places along the rivers in the Northeast, the Japanese Dongtuo Company or Manchurian Financial Association lend funds to instigate pro-Japanese Koreans to go around to rent and plant paddy fields in order to monopolize the rice field business in the Northeast. According to a survey in June of this year, in Liaoning Province, such as the Hui River, Antu, Linjiang, Liu River, Zhuang River, Liaoyuan, Andong, Kangping, Benxi Lake, Shahekou, Tong River, Changbai, Heishan, Xifeng, Dongfeng, and the Yingkou, Haicheng, Taonan, Xinmin, Xingjing, and other places along the Hun River. The number of Koreans renting land to grow rice is more than 250,000. The area of paddy fields occupied is more than 2 million hectares. In Jilin, such as the Songhua, Tumen, Mudan three rivers, and the Yanji, Hunchun, Wangqing, Helong, Ningan, Dunhua, Emu, Dongning, Mishan, Tongjiang, Fujin, Mengjiang, Huachuan, Huadian, Hulin, Jilin, Changchun, Yitong, Dehui, Changling, Fuyu, Yilan, and other places in the Liao River and Yitong River basins. According to statistics, the number of Koreans growing rice is more than 300,000. The area of paddy fields occupied is about 4 million hectares. In Heilongjiang Province, such as the Black Nen River, Yangyuan, Hulan, Suihua, Hailun, Mulan Bayan, Kedong Rehe, Daohua Hulunbuir and other places in the upper and lower reaches of the Nen River and Hei River. There are about 560,000 Koreans renting land to farm. The area of paddy fields is about 150,000 hectares. In short, the footprints of Korean farmers are all over the river basins and low-lying fields in the three northeastern provinces, and the benefits of good paddy fields are almost directly and indirectly taken away by Koreans and Japanese. Not only that, the Japanese, on the one hand, instigated Koreans to rent land and cultivate in the hinterland of our Northeast, and on the other hand, they lent capital through the Mantetsu Company to vigorously encourage Koreans along the Mantetsu line to open up paddy fields, and they seized all the paddy fields cultivated by our Chinese people along the line for the use of Korean farmers. According to Japanese estimates, within three years, 300,000 hectares of paddy fields can be added along the Mantetsu line. The purpose of this active encouragement of Korean farmers to rent and cultivate farmland and open up farmland is not only to encourage Korean farmers to migrate to our country, but the most sinister thing is to use the hands of Korean farmers to buy our land and take it as their own. The harm of seizing our national power and endangering our people's food is the greatest. Secondly, over the years, Korean farmers and our Chinese farmers have created endless disputes due to the competition for water sources and rice fields. For example, the case of Korean overseas Chinese forcibly occupying civilian land and digging ditches for irrigation in Fushun County in the past, and the recent Wanbaoshan Incident, are all examples.

<h3>Record of the Annihilation of the Red Army by Siege at Donggu</h3>
<p>▲ Famous Bandit Den Smashed in Ten Days</p>
<p>▲ Over 30,000 Bandits Captured, Over 10,000 Guns Seized</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The base nests of the Red bandits Zhu, Mao, Peng, and Huang in Jiangxi province are one in Ningdu and one in Donggu. The main targets of attack for the Annihilation of the Red Army are those two places. Subsequently, Ningdu was recovered. Then all efforts were made to fiercely attack Donggu. Now, a record of the battle is as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Situation of Donggu: Donggu is located at the border of five counties: Ji'an, Jishui, Yongfeng, Taihe, and Xingguo, about 120 li from Ji'an county town. Donggu is surrounded by many mountains, like Futian in Ji'an, Baisha and Shuinan in Jishui, Yaotian, Shaxi, and Longgang in Yongfeng, Gulonggang and Chenggang in Xingguo, and Gubei and Luojiaxu in Taihe. The terrain is dangerous. Although there are one or two narrow paths, neither carriages nor people can walk side by side. In the center, there are plains and fertile fields of several hundred li, with the Hu River winding through them, like a paradise. Since the late Ming Dynasty, it has been occupied by vagrant bandits. During the Qing Dynasty, it was once recovered. In the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, it was occupied by local bandits and mutinous soldiers such as Hu Zhusheng and Luo Binghui. At first, it was nothing more than a haven for those fleeing after robbery. The local government, due to its remote location and mutual buck-passing among the counties, refused to suppress it, leading to its growth. In the early seventeenth year, after the Hunan-Guangdong-Jiangxi armies broke through Jinggang, Zhu Mao entered Fujian from the border of Hunan and Guangdong. Their forces gradually extended from the west bank of the Gan River to the east bank, eventually concentrating in Donggu. The Red bandit pseudo-Central Executive Committee, Agricultural and Workers Bank, Military and Political School, rear hospitals, and Soviet government organs were all established in Donggu. Zhu, Mao, Peng, and Huang then brazenly used this place as the center of gravity for issuing orders, redizing the southeast, and commanding Red bandit riots in various provinces. Nearby counties also fell into a state of utter disaster.</p>
<p>▲ Steps of the Attack: This time, the Annihilation of the Red Army attacked Donggu with the right wing of Chen Mingshu advancing from Ji'an and Taihe, attacking its northwest; the Fifth Route Army advancing from Jishui and Yongfeng, attacking its northeast; the central route Twenty-sixth Route Army detouring its west from Ningle; and the left wing detouring its south from Ningdu, cutting off its route into Fujian. After the general offensive order was issued, Chen Mingshu's forces advanced from Futian through the border of Taihe to Xingguo, in order to converge with the left wing, first capturing Xingcheng, then taking Donggu. The Han and Hao divisions of the Fifth Route Army searched and advanced southwest after capturing Tengtian, Baisha, and Shuinan, connecting with the Jiang and Cai divisions. The central route Li Yunjie division arrived near Shaxi on the 22nd. About a division of bandit troops under Huang Gonglue was stationed there. Li's division then attacked them at dawn. Around 8:00 a.m., the battle became fierce. The bandits repeatedly launched fierce attacks on the flanks and rear of Li's division. At 12:00 noon, Li's division launched a fierce charge against the bandits. The bandits could not withstand it and retreated in succession, so they occupied Shaxi, seizing more than 400 firearms and capturing more than 1,000 bandits, including dozens of female bandits. When the remaining bandits retreated towards Longgangxu, the planes followed and dropped bombs, killing many bandits. At the same time, another unit of the left wing of the Annihilation of the Red Army recovered Longgang. After Li's division cleared out the remaining bandits in Shaxi, it continued to advance westward on the 24th. The bandits feigned retreat to the vicinity of Chiban'ao and Yuexi, using a small number of peasant bandits to hold the front, guarding the pre-built fortifications, while tens of thousands of armed bandits detoured to attack the flanks and rear of Li's division. This was again detected by the planes, which immediately dropped several bombs on the hidden main force of the Red bandits. The bombs all exploded, killing and wounding many bandits. At the same time, a communication bag was used to notify Li's division, ordering them to pay attention to the bandit's flank attack. Meanwhile, Gao Shuxun and Hao Mengling's armies were also notified to send teams to flank and attack. Each unit received the plane's report and immediately began the attack. From 7:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., more than 3,000 bandits were killed and 1,700-1,800 were captured in the vicinity of Yuexi. More than 3,000 rifles, more than 20 machine guns, and 18 mortars were seized. The remaining bandits scattered and fled back to Donggu. Spears, flags, and the corpses of Red bandits were everywhere. At this time, the right wing and central route of the Annihilation of the Red Army were completely connected. On the left wing, after capturing Ningdu, the main force advanced westward from Ning. Chen and Mao's divisions occupied Longgang on the 23rd, killing and capturing many bandits. Zhao's division originally advanced southwest from Ning, cutting off the route from Donggu and Xingguo through Ruijin into Fujian. On the 22nd, it recovered Gulonggang, an important place on the border of the four counties of Xing, Yu, Ning, and Rui, cutting off the connection between the bandits of Xing and Rui, and intercepting countless firearms and supplies transported by the Red bandits to Fujian. The remaining bandits fled in disarray to Donggu, and the armies also surrounded Donggu.</p>
<p>▲ Victory Report from the Headquarters: Donggu, the old nest of the Red bandits, was captured by the right wing army on the 27th after being surrounded. The headquarters staff office has sent a concise telegram of victory. The original telegram stated, "After our army recovered Shicheng and Ningdu, the bandit troops fled back to their old nest in droves, still plotting a final resistance. Our left and right wing army groups took advantage of the situation to converge and attack. According to repeated telegrams from Commander-in-Chief Chen of our right wing Third Route Army, our right wing Third Route Army occupied Shaxi on the 22nd of this month, followed up with a rapid advance, catching the bandits by surprise, and thrusting straight into the bandit's den from behind. On the same day, Commander-in-Chief Cai of our right wing First Army Corps led his troops to attack from the side of Shanggu, breaking through Longgang on the 25th, and then continuing to advance, using lightning tactics to capture the old nest of Donggu in one fell swoop on the 27th. The bandits entrenched in their nests, initially resisting with all their might, but were eventually surrounded by our army, breaking through the key points. The bandits could not take care of each other, so they were completely annihilated without a single one escaping. It is estimated that more than 30,000 large and small bandits were captured, more than 14,200 rifles, and countless other weapons, equipment, documents, rice, and livestock, etc. In addition, comprehensive telegrams from Commander-in-Chief Zhu Shaoliang, Commander-in-Chief Jiang, Commander-in-Chief Sun, Army Commander Chen, Army Commander Zhao, and Army Commander Wei of our left wing army group stated that our Second Route Army advanced from Gulonggang through Yuexi to coordinate the attack on Longgang and Donggu by the left wing army group, and to block the bandits fleeing south. The First Route Army advanced from Qingtangxu north to Yutian Nankengxu, directly attacking Huangpi Xiaobu. The Third Army Corps fiercely attacked Lokoujie Huangpi area from Jinzhu Dongshentou Beijie. The Second Army and Tenth Army of the Fourth Army Corps controlled Shicheng and Ningdu, waiting to intercept and encircle the bandits when they fled outward. After the deployments were completed, the armies began to move on the 23rd, approaching step by step. When entering the nests, the bandits used pre-built fortifications and various firearms, relying on dangerous places, stubbornly resisting our army's fierce attack for several days and nights. Our air force also made every effort to bomb, destroying countless supplies in their nests. The bandits could not withstand it, and our army charged forward bravely, completely recovering Huangpi and Xiaobu on the 25th and 26th. The corpses were piled up everywhere in the bandit nests, and blood stained the mountains and valleys. It is reported that the ringleaders Zhu Mao Huangxiang mostly died in the chaos among the bandits, and no less than 50,000 people were released from coercion and ransom, etc. Donggu, Longgang, Huangpi, and Xiaobu were originally the most important bandit dens and the only major base of the Red bandits in Jiangxi province. All the political and organizational organs of the bandit party were concentrated here. After this sweep, they have been fundamentally annihilated. Special telegram to report the victory. Staff Office of the Nanchang Headquarters, 28th day, 5:35 pm."</p>
<h3>Continued News of the Flood in Hubei Province</h3>
<p>▲ More Than 50 Counties in the Province Flooded</p>
<p>▲ All Circles Immediately Establish Emergency Relief Association</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: This time, the continuous plum rains, rising rivers, and breached dikes have been reported repeatedly. As of yesterday (the 27th), the rain has not stopped, and the disaster area in the province has reached more than 50 counties. The streets of Wuhan have also been flooded, truly a rare disaster unseen in decades. The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Disaster Situation in Various Counties: The counties have long suffered from bandit troubles, and the people have been displaced. After the active suppression of bandits by various armies, the situation has gradually been cleared. The government then tried to summon the refugees to engage in farming, in order to gradually restore the vitality of the countryside. After sowing, the rainfall was quite even, and it was generally expected to be a good year. Unexpectedly, as the rice and wheat were about to ripen, continuous rain fell, and much of the grain rotted. In addition, the water was raging, breaching dikes and dams, and submerging fields and houses. The number of people who died in the water is countless. For example, in the Yangtze River basin, the counties of Badong, Zigui, Xingshan, Changyang, Yichang, Yidu, Dangyang, Zhijiang, Songzi, Jiangling, Jianli, Shishou, Mianyang, Jiayu, Hanyang, Wuchang, Huanggang, Qishui, Qichun, Daye, Yangxin, Guangji, and Huangmei, and in the Xiang River basin, the counties of Yicheng, Zhongxiang, Qianjiang, and Hanchuan, and along the Zhang and Yun rivers, the counties of Yingshan, Anlu, Yunmeng, and Xiaogan have all suffered unprecedented disasters. The county magistrates of various counties sent telegrams to the province, requesting relief more than ten times a day.</p>
<p>▲ Wuhan Flood Situation: Wuhan is the place where the Yangtze and Han rivers converge. Half a month ago, the Xiang River rose, almost level with the banks. Afterwards, it continued to rise. The water of the Yangtze River also increased day by day. The low-lying areas of the inner streets of Hankou, due to excessive accumulation of water that could not be discharged, had long been submerged and navigable by boats. On the 27th, the river water suddenly rose by more than ten feet, overflowing the banks. The most prosperous areas, such as Jianghanguan, Xinsheng Road, Zhongshan Road, Jiaotong Road, the Post Office, Special District One, Special District Two, Special District Three, and the French and Japanese concessions, were all flooded, and traffic was cut off. In Wuchang, Hanyangmen, Kuaizijie, Pinghumen, Qingshiqiao, Juwanjie, Gongyuanjie, etc., were also flooded. In Hanyang, due to the long-term ban on ferries, it was not possible to investigate, but it was roughly estimated that more than half of the area was also flooded. The Wuhan market was greatly affected by the flood, and the prices of all goods soared, even vegetables had doubled in price.</p>
<p>▲ Strict Dike Protection: As the flood spread, the Zhanggong Dike, which protects Hankou, and the Wutai and Wufeng sluices, which protect Wuchang, were all closely watched. The provincial government, the Department of Civil Affairs, the Department of Construction, the Hankou Municipal Government, the Water Conservancy Bureau, the Provincial Public Security Bureau, the Water Police Bureau, and the Garrison Headquarters all sent personnel to recruit workers, investigate, and provide emergency protection, and were extremely busy. Chen Keming, director of the Water Conservancy Bureau, personally inspected the dikes and sluices. The Garrison Department also sent teams to guard them. According to the survey, although cracks were found in the Zhanggong Dike, they were straight lines and did not pose any danger. The Wutai Sluice was also safe, but the Wufeng Sluice was quite dangerous due to damage to the gate panels. In addition, on the 25th, the Garrison Department captured seven Red bandits digging the dike at Zhanggong Dike. It was reported that 23 others were at large. Soldiers have now been added to defend, and there should be no accidents. As for temporary flood control, the representatives of various agencies and groups held a meeting and decided to set up temporary flood control offices in Wuchang, Hankou, and Hanyang. The Wuchang office was attached to the Water Conservancy Bureau, the Hankou office was attached to the Municipal Government, and the Hanyang office was attached to the County Government. A hundred earthen dikes were built, and water was pumped out to restore traffic in Wuhan as soon as possible.</p>
<p>▲ Preparing for Relief: For the sake of providing relief to the disaster victims, the provincial government specifically decided at the political meeting on the 20th to telegraph the Central Relief Committee to allocate large sums of money, and to telegraph various provinces to raise relief funds to provide relief. At the same time, the provincial government and the Department of Civil Affairs sent personnel to the disaster areas to investigate quickly. On the 23rd, another meeting was held to decide to entrust the Water Conservancy Bureau to preside over the repair of the Wuhan dikes and the construction of the Department of Construction, the Provincial Public Security Bureau, the Hankou Municipal Government, the Hankou Public Security Bureau, and other agencies to assist. In addition, the rice stored in the Ping Tiao Bureau was not sold by auction, but reserved for relief to the counties. The existing rice has been distributed, first to Yunmeng and other eight counties, and other counties will be dealt with separately. However, the flood has been increasing in recent days, and the situation is even more urgent. The provincial government then held a meeting on the 27th and decided to establish a Flood Emergency Relief Committee, extensively inviting celebrities from all circles of the party, government, military, and business to jointly seek relief.</p>
<p>▲ Relief Association Established: The chairman of the provincial government, He Chengjun, convened a meeting of all circles of the party, government, and military at the Hankou General Chamber of Commerce at 3:00 p.m. on the 28th to discuss relief measures. Those present included Garrison Commander Xia Douyin, Civil Affairs Director Liu Wendao, Finance Director Wu Guozhen, Construction Director Fang Dazhi, Peng Jieshi of the Provincial Committee, Ma Dengying, Zhu Huaibing, Zuo Duo, Liu Yun, Wen Juntian of the Municipal Committee, Mayor He Baohua, Chamber of Commerce Chairman He Hengfu, and more than 100 bank presidents. Chairman He Chengjun reported on the flood situation. Then Liu Wendao spoke, saying that fundraising was too slow and that a loan of 300,000 yuan should first be obtained from the banking group, with the government responsible for repayment. After discussion of various proposals, it was decided (1) to establish the Flood Emergency Relief Committee immediately. Those present at the meeting today are natural members of the committee. The location of the committee is attached to the General Chamber of Commerce, and in accordance with the organizational charter, He Chengjun, Ma Dengying, Zhu Huaibing, Zuo Duo, Wen Juntian, He Hengfu, Chen Jingyu, Su Taiyu, Yue Huanting, Cai Fuqing, and Yu Chongwei were elected as standing committee members. (2) Chen Keming, director of the Water Conservancy Bureau, was to go to various counties to inspect the dike projects, and the entire staff of the Water Conservancy Bureau and the Department of Construction would participate in the Wuhan protection work, under the command of Fang Dazhi and Peng Jieshi. (3) The engineer corps of all divisions and brigades stationed in Wuhan were to participate in the emergency rescue work. If necessary, infantry could be dispatched. (4) Fang Dazhi and Peng Jieshi were to go to various dikes to investigate and plan, and the public security chiefs of the two provinces of Wuhan and Hankou were also to strictly supervise their subordinates to investigate and report any breaches. After the meeting, He convened the first meeting of the Standing Committee, passed the organizational charter, and announced its establishment, and elected He Chengjun as chairman, Ma Dengying as director of the General Affairs Section, Zhu Huaibing as deputy, He Hengfu as director of the Fundraising Section, Su Taiyu as deputy, Cai Fuqing as director of the Relief Section, Chen Jingyu as deputy, Yu Chongwei as director of the Audit Section, Yue Shouting as deputy, Zuo Duo as director of the Investigation Section, and Wen Juntian as deputy. From this day on, they would come to the meeting to work in order to actively provide relief to the disaster victims. (July 28th)</p>
<h3>The Flood in Southern Anhui is Extremely Severe</h3>
<p>▲ Rice-Snatching Riots Occur in Various Places</p>
<p>▲ Chen Tiaoyuan Arrives in Wuhu from Liu'an</p>
<p>▲ Ban Rice Exports to Maintain People's Food Supply</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Among the provinces along the Yangtze River, Anhui Province is the most severely affected by the flood. More than 40 counties in the province have been submerged. Southern Anhui relies heavily on agricultural products. At this time when the autumn harvest is approaching, the losses from this flood are incalculable. All counties such as Xuancheng, Nanling, Fanchang, Wuwei, and Tongcheng have been almost completely submerged. The two major weirs of Fenghuang and Linmapu in Wuhu and the Huangsitan weir in Wuwei have all collapsed one after another. Today, the Baoda weir in Fanchang has also been affected. In total, more than three or four million mu of fertile land in the counties of southern Anhui have been submerged, forming a vast expanse of water for hundreds of miles around. A few days ago, a rice merchant from Tongcheng loaded 1,100 shi of rice and came to Wuhu. When passing through Gaokengpu, 20 li away from Wuhu, it was robbed by the disaster victims. Last night, a wheat boat arrived at Pangxiexi and was looted by hundreds of refugees nearby. Six of the boat crew and owners were beaten, and one elderly man was in critical condition. All have been taken to Zhong Shouzhis Hospital on Zhongshan Road for treatment. Rice-snatching incidents in other towns and villages are occurring frequently every day. People are restless, and unruly elements are taking the opportunity to incite them. The situation is extremely worrying. Dozens of bandits arrived at Lugang Town, 15 li away from Wuhu, last night, joining hundreds of disaster victims to loot many shops in the town and attempt to seize the firearms of the defense corps. Fortunately, the defense was tight and they were unable to succeed. However, the bandit ships have not gone far, and the situation is very tense. This morning, the head of the defense corps, She Hongqian, and others came to Wuhu to request troops. Wang Leshan, the brigade commander of the 171st Brigade, sent a company of soldiers to attack by small steamer. This morning, the leaders of all circles of the party, government, military, police, gentry, and business in Wuhu held a joint meeting at the county government to discuss emergency relief measures for the flood. It was decided to organize a flood relief association. In addition to asking the provincial government and fellow Anhui natives abroad, such as Xu Shiying, for donations, they would first borrow 3,000 yuan from the Bank of China in Wuhu, together with 1,000 yuan raised on the spot, to be used for emergency relief and to stabilize rice prices, which should not exceed 11 yuan per shi. Public sales offices were set up, and temples and schools in higher-lying areas were selected to establish refugee shelters. It is estimated that in Wuhu city alone, more than 800 households had their houses flooded. Disaster victims from other villages and towns came to the city seeking food everywhere. After the meeting, Chen Tiaoyuan, the chairman of the Anhui provincial government, happened to return to Wuhu from Liu'an after suppressing bandits, and everyone went to the Jianggan to wait for him. Chen took the Rongchang steamer via Hefei and arrived at the port at 5:00 p.m. After landing, he went to the third floor of the Zhonghua Hotel to meet with people from all walks of life. Chen said that the bandits in Liu'an had been severely hit and were not a threat for the time being. The emergency relief was extremely important because the flood in various counties of this province was so severe. Therefore, he had to return to Anqing first to prepare for emergency relief. Once the relief was somewhat effective, he planned to go to Nanchang immediately to discuss with Chairman Chiang the thorough strategy for bandit suppression. As for the widespread flood damage this time, which covered the entire Anhui province, Hefei was more than ten feet under water, and Wuhu and the counties in southern Anhui, which were the rice-producing areas of this province, had suffered such heavy damage, and in the future there was a danger of hardship from top to bottom. The only thing to do in the near future was to first allocate several thousand yuan for emergency relief, and for the sake of the people's food supply throughout the province, to immediately ban the export of rice and grain, and then to organize a flood relief organization in the province. Then he went to the residence of Yang Chunpu, the former director of the rice donation bureau, for dinner. At 9:00 p.m., he changed to a small Wuhu steamer and returned to Anqing directly. That evening, all circles in Wuhu also telegraphed the province, requesting a clear order to prohibit the export of rice and grain, the telegram stating, "Chen Junjian, Chairman of the Anhui Provincial Government, continuous rain in recent days has caused flooding, and the weirs and fields have been completely submerged. The same is true for all counties in Anhui Province. Rice prices are soaring and cannot be suppressed. If we do not think of the future and prevent it, and ban the export of rice from the province, the starving people of Anhui Province will inevitably become starving corpses. In addition to organizing a flood relief association to maintain the current situation, a meeting was held and it was decided to telegraph immediately for a clear order to ban the export of rice from the province in order to save the disaster victims and maintain the people's food supply. Sincerely, the Wuhu County Consolidation Committee, County Government, Public Security Bureau, County Chamber of Commerce, and County Education Bureau." (July 28th)</p>
<h3>The Flood Disaster in Henan Province is Severe</h3>
<p>▲ Heavy Rain in Shangcai for Several Weeks</p>
<p>▲ Rivers in Wuyang Collapse and Break</p>
<p>Kaifeng Correspondence: The flood situation in various counties of Henan Province is also extremely serious. The reports from Shangcai and Wuyang counties are recorded as follows: Li Yuan, the magistrate of Shangcai County, reported that the county had been continuously overcast and rainy, without stopping for several weeks, and there had been torrential rain for three days and nights. The area near the city was higher in elevation, but the accumulated water was also three feet deep. In places with lower elevation, such as Huangbu, Xiaogan, Xindi, Chenzhai, Rufen, Zengfu, Yangqiu, Kangning, and Wangli, the land for dozens of li in all directions had become a marshland. Countless fields and houses were washed away, and many people and livestock were drowned. The cries of sorrow were heard everywhere, too terrible to bear. In addition to conducting a detailed investigation of the disaster in each district and reporting it in another case, he was requesting an emergency relief to save the disaster victims. In addition, Xu Futian, the magistrate of Wuyang County, reported in a telegram on behalf of the county that since the beginning of June, there had been continuous rain for several weeks, mountain floods had broken out, and the Li River, Ni River, Sha River, and Hui River within the territory had successively breached their banks by tens or hundreds of zhang. The villages and fields along the rivers had all become marshlands. The areas most severely affected were Qili Township and Duanzhuang Township in the first district, Tianzhuang Township and Qiaozhang Township in the second district, Dihu Township in the sixth district, and the banks of the Sha and Hui Rivers in the seventh district. It was estimated that thousands of houses had been washed away and countless livestock drowned. The autumn crops that had been planted were completely submerged. Cries of sorrow were heard everywhere, too terrible to bear. Farming was hopeless, and the lives of the people were in danger. The disaster was serious, an unprecedented flood in 20 years, and they were requesting an emergency relief to provide aid. The Provincial Relief Association has sent personnel with money to distribute it and has also forwarded the situation to the National Relief Association and various charitable organizations in the north and south.</p>
<h3>Mr. Wang Rongbao's Speech Upon Arrival in Shenyang</h3>
<p>Shenyang Dispatch: Mr. Wang Rongbao, the resident ambassador to Japan, was dispatched by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Korea to investigate the massacre. Having completed his mission and returned to the country, he arrived in Andong on the 23rd. At 8:45 PM that evening, he boarded the Anfeng train to Shenyang, arriving in Liaoning at 6:20 AM on the 24th. Those who welcomed him at the station included Mr. Li Ruzhou, Deputy Adjutant-General of the Border Defense Command, representing Deputy Commander Zhang; Mr. Sun, an adjutant representing Zhang Zuoxiang; Mr. Wang Jinghuan, Special Diplomatic Commissioner representing Zang Shiyi, Chairman of the Liaoning Provincial Government; and over forty Chinese and Japanese news reporters. He alighted at the Kaining Hotel on Yangsan Jinglu Road. Reporters met him in the train, where Mr. Wang shared the investigation process.</p>
<p>Following his assignment to investigate the case, he departed from Tokyo with the consul on the 13th. He arrived in Busan on the 15th, Seoul on the 16th, and Pyongyang on the 17th. After staying for two days, he went to Chinampo, then returned to Seoul, followed by Incheon, and then back to Seoul before arriving in Sinuiju. The investigation journey lasted a total of twelve days. The investigation revealed that the damage in Pyongyang was the most severe. Based on confirmed reports, ninety-five Chinese compatriots were killed, and over two hundred were injured. The whereabouts of others remain unknown. The loss of property has not been accurately calculated, but the Chamber of Commerce estimates it to be over two million. Next was Incheon, with two deaths and losses of less than one hundred thousand. There were two deaths each in Wonsan and Sinuiju. Chinampo and Seoul did not suffer significant damage. The riot in Pyongyang occurred on the 5th, a Sunday. The Japanese side received the news that evening but thought it was not serious. In reality, the Korean people were highly organized in their plans for the riot, and the situation suddenly escalated uncontrollably. The Japanese police were scattered in various locations, and it took time to gather them. By the time the Japanese police mobilized and came out to suppress the riot, our compatriots had already suffered significant casualties and damages. In Sinuiju, due to its proximity to our border in Andong, there was close communication regarding defense, and the incident was immediately suppressed. This was largely due to the efforts of our officials and police. Personally, I feel that this tragic incident is extremely serious and cannot be resolved through simple negotiations. Observing this incident, the Wanbaoshan incident was very small, and logically it was insufficient to cause such a major event. It was ultimately caused by three factors: (1) Misreporting by Japanese and Korean news reporters; (2) Ignorant Koreans being misled; (3) Ineffective prevention by the Japanese police. My personal view on this case can be summarized in two sentences: Compensation for damage, no compensation for no damage. Given the severity of the damage, Japan should be responsible for compensation. Japanese government's attitude: Shidehara [Kijuro] expressed to me that he felt deeply saddened by this tragic incident under the current global situation and under Japanese territory. He felt obligated to provide condolences and relief, but there was much debate on the issue of international legal responsibility. Therefore, the Japanese government absolutely refuses to admit the point of compensation. Accepting international legal responsibility may cause the current cabinet to be overthrown by the Japanese people. Our country has insisted on compensation. If a satisfactory resolution cannot be reached, the only final option is for all Chinese compatriots in Korea to return home. I plan to stay in Shenyang for one or two days to investigate the truth of the Wanbaoshan incident and then go to [Heilongjiang] to meet Deputy Commander Zhang to seek his instructions. Then, I will go to the capital to report to the National Government and discuss negotiation methods. The location may be in Tokyo or Nanjing. I personally prefer Nanjing. I do not plan to stay long in the capital and will return to my post. The reporter asked about Japan's diplomacy toward China. Wang Rongbao replied that Shidehara had solemnly stated to him that he would not change his policy, no matter what attacks he received from political parties. Japan is willing to negotiate the Sino-Japanese jurisdictional issue on conditions, and it is not true that they are unwilling to negotiate immediately. On the railway issue, Japan also does not insist on the parallel line issue, ultimately aiming for coexistence and co-prosperity. With the existing railways in the Northeast and the South Manchuria Railway, Director Kimura will come to Liaoning after finishing his affairs in Tokyo and will definitely start negotiations. He will not delay. Japan will never give up its vested interests in Manchuria and Mongolia under any cabinet. However, he has faced many difficulties in years of diplomatic negotiation and has never had a day of peace. (July 24th)</p>
<h3>All Sectors in Jinan Establish an Anti-Japanese Association</h3>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: All sectors in Jinan are deeply angered by the Wanbaoshan Incident and the massacre of overseas Chinese by Koreans. Consequently, various trade associations have initiated the organization of an Anti-Japanese Overseas Chinese Protection Association. On the 26th, at 2:00 PM, they invited various trade associations and farmers' associations to hold a meeting at the auditorium of the county party headquarters to discuss methods of action. Over sixty representatives from various trade associations and farmers' associations attended, along with Fang Ziying and others representing the county party headquarters. Fang Ziying reported on the progress of the Korean case and the public's anger. Next, they discussed methods of action and resolved to (1) establish a preparatory office for the Jinan Anti-Japanese Overseas Chinese Protection Association, and nominated Feng Zhensheng (Guangdong goods), Wang Bozhou (newspapers), Li Mengfu (transport), Zhang Guansan (cotton), Fu Yuting (cigarettes), Cui Zihong (shoes and hats), Du Zhensheng (wood), Zhang Pinzhi (general merchandise), Tian Zhongtao (alcohol), Ma Yichen (fresh goods), Zhang Yufu (silk and cloth), Zhang Jiyuan (salt), Guo Zuoting (flour), Qiao Xiaozhou (farmers' association), Zhang Yanchen (pharmaceuticals), and fifteen others to be responsible for preparation and action. (2) On August 2nd, a formal establishment conference will be convened for various agencies, groups, and schools in the county and city to elect executive and supervisory committee members. The meeting adjourned at around 4:00 PM, and the atmosphere was extremely tense throughout the entire event. (July 26th)</p>
<h3>Shandong Province Preserves the Chen Family's Ancient Seals</h3>
<p>▲The Library is Negotiating Purchase</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: In Shandong's Weixian County, the Chen, Cao, Guo, and Gao families are the most famous for collecting antiquities. However, their descendants have declined in recent times, and they have begun to sell the antiquities. The Qin and Han bricks and tiles of the Gao family are only a small part. The most famous collection belongs to Chen Fuzhai. After Chen's death, everything was equally divided among his three sons, including one share for the Mao Gong Ding and four-eared *dun* bronze vessel (it has long been rumored that the Mao Gong Ding was sold to the Japanese, but it is actually treasured by Zhou Shutao and kept secret from others; even rubbings are sold for one hundred and sixty yuan, and a Westerner once estimated the ding's value at five million yuan, which shows how precious it is. The four-eared *dun* bronze vessel was indeed bought by the Japanese), one share for the ten *zhong* bells (although the Chen family called it "ten bells," there were actually eleven bells. When it was sold to the Japanese, only nine were given, and a fake one was added to make up ten, while two were hidden. Later, the Japanese found out and offered a high price to buy them, and eventually all of them went to Japan), and one share for the ten thousand seals. In addition, there were over ten thousand ancient pottery shards and two bronze mirrors, which were also divided equally. So far, the *ding*, *dun*, and ten *zhong* bells have all been sold. Only the ten thousand seals remain. Chen's collection of seals is documented in the *Wan Yin Lou Seal Catalog*, which is the most comprehensive. Each volume of the catalog sells for six hundred yuan, and even photocopies sell for sixteen yuan. It is said that although the collection is called "ten thousand seals," in addition to those falsely attributed to others, there are actually over six thousand two hundred pieces "some say over six thousand five hundred." Recently, after Gao Hansheng sold the Qin and Han bricks and tiles from his Shangtao Studio to the Japanese, the Chen family also considered selling the seals. It is said that three Japanese people lingered in Tanxian, negotiating a purchase and offering one hundred and twenty thousand yuan. However, the local authorities found out and expelled the Japanese. Therefore, the Chen family indirectly expressed a willingness to sell to the provincial library, taking less than the Japanese price, to show respect for the government's intention to preserve antiquities. They are currently in negotiations. As for the pottery shards, ancient mirrors, and ancient bricks, they are also being sold to the library. The value of complete pottery shards with inscriptions is fifty cents each, and broken ones are half that price. The price of the ancient mirrors has not yet been negotiated. It is said that the Chen family's bronze mirrors have all types and are all polished on one side and have flowers and inscriptions on the other. Two of the mirrors, when the floral side is shone in sunlight, the flowers can pass through the mirror and be projected onto the wall, like a modern movie; they are truly treasures. Unfortunately, one is broken, and only one remains. Also, for the over one thousand ancient bricks and tiles, it was agreed that those identical to the Gao family's Qin and Han bricks and tiles purchased by the library would not be accepted, and the remaining ones would be fairly priced. At the same time, the Cao (Hongxun) family's collection of over one thousand ancient bricks and the Guo family's collection of over three thousand ancient seals in Weixian County are also being negotiated for sale to the library, and they have all expressed a willingness to accept a low price, but the government needs to raise tens of thousands of yuan to purchase everything. The current library director, Wang Xiantang, plans to suggest to the library design committee that they quickly determine fundraising methods to purchase all the above antiquities and the books from the Haiyuan Pavilion to preserve them.</p>

<h3>Progress of the Capital Antiquities Institute's Exhibition</h3>
<p>Since Shu Chushi took over the Nanjing Antiquities Preservation Institute, he has made great efforts to rectify it, employing workers to repair the buildings and grounds, giving them a new look. He has collected bells, tripods, *yi* vessels, bricks, tiles, steles, and stone inscriptions, as well as famous calligraphy and paintings, selecting the best for display to facilitate research. Archaeology can correct historical omissions and promote social interest in academic research, which is of great importance to cultural progress. Currently, they are compiling a catalog of antiquities from various dynasties, making systematic records to ensure that visitors have a clear understanding of historical events. They are now striving to expand further to meet public expectations. Last month, they specifically requested the Ministry of Education to jointly issue an official letter to all provinces and cities across the country, instructing their subordinates to widely collect and send to the institute historical and cultural relics, calligraphy and paintings, stele rubbings, stone relics, and photographs of famous sites in their respective regions for public viewing. It is expected that after this solicitation, the exhibits at the institute will be even richer.</p>
<h3>Bandit Leader Widow Zhang Executed in Western Henan</h3>
<p>Luoyang Dispatch: The 65th Division of the National Army recently suppressed bandits in western Henan and captured the notorious bandit leader Widow Zhang. After interrogation, she was executed by firing squad on July 22nd. The following is a record of her confession: Zhang Bingqing, alias Yu Jie, was captured by the 65th Division in the seventh district of Pingdeng County and sent to the Luoyang Western Workers' Supervision Office for interrogation. Official (Q): Where are you from? How old are you? Where is your maiden home? Where is your husband's home? (A): Luoning, 46 years old, maiden home is Qiangtou in Luoning, husband's home is Beicun in Luoning. (Q): How many people are in your family? How much land do you cultivate? (A): My parents-in-law, my husband, four brothers, my three nephews, and three daughters-in-law. We have five or six hundred mu of land. (Q): What are the names of your father-in-law, your mother-in-law's surname, and the names of your husband and sons? (A): Father-in-law Zhang Luoshan, mother-in-law Wang, husband Zhang Shudou, eldest son Zhang Mingsheng, second son Zhang Zhensheng, third son Zhang Guangsheng. (Q): Why did you go out and become a bandit leader? (A): My maiden name is He. I married at fourteen. My husband died early, leaving behind three sons. My father-in-law was killed by bandits, and my mother-in-law died from opium addiction. Later, the property was divided. My eldest son died of illness. My second son used to be a company commander, but later he came home, and I did not ask him to go out and do anything. My third son was studying at home. Unexpectedly, my husband's fourth younger brother, Shukui, killed my two sons and sold all three of my daughters-in-law. Because my entire family died, I became angry and sold a lot of land to buy hundreds of guns to become a bandit leader. (Q): Why did your husband's fourth younger brother, Shukui, collude with bandits to kill your sons? (A): My husband had four brothers. After the family was divided, the fourth younger brother did not engage in proper business, smoked opium, and did not do good things. He squandered the family property and intended to kill my entire family to plot for my share of the family property. It is now heard that the fourth brother has fled abroad, and his whereabouts are unknown. (Q): Where were you when your sons were killed by your fourth younger brother? (A): I happened to be visiting my maiden home and was fortunate to escape unharmed. (Q): How much family property do you still have, and who manages it? (A): There are still a hundred mu of bamboo land at home. It is now heard that it is managed by my clansman Yongquan. (Q): Explain in detail what you have been through since you became a bandit leader these past few years. (A): I have been living in the team for these past few years and have never returned home. I paid for many of the guns for the various bandit groups. Most of the bandit groups listened to my orders. People like Li and Zhang are all my adopted sons. When I attacked Luoning City last year, I allocated a battalion of guns and soldiers to Wang Laowu. In May and June of this year, I gathered various bandit groups in the Longmen area to form some teams, preparing to surrender. (Q): How many bandit groups did you gather in the end? Who were the bandit leaders? How many guns and soldiers were there in total? (A): In Longmen, I discussed with many bandit leaders such as Yang Delian, Han Qiulin, Li Zuoxin, Li Qifang, Wen Zhi, Du Keqin, Guo Jiulao, Wu Mingli, Dong Faru, and Zhang Tianwei. It was estimated that we could gather ten thousand people. Li Shichen also arrived and added eight bandit groups. We wanted to gather all the teams and form three divisions. We had gathered over three thousand people, but the organization had not yet been completed. There were three thousand rifles, and the rest were submachine guns, as well as four machine guns. Just as we were discussing, the army arrived at various passes to intercept us, scattering my teams. Many bandit leaders fled and were captured. Now that my revenge has been taken, I have no regrets about dying. It is only my dissatisfaction that they will get all the land in my family for nothing.</p>

<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Sandbank Dams Cut Off Sanzhangpu River: This continuous rain has caused disasters, with low-lying areas being flooded. Even the high-lying areas in the west are affected. The waterway in the west, Sanzhangpu River, relies entirely on accepting water from the eastern lakes and connecting to the three branches of Shazhou to the west, discharging into the Yangtze River. Irrigation and water conservancy are regulated in this manner. Unexpectedly, recently, some residents of Shazhou, due to the rising water level in Shazhou, built dams to block the southern end of the three branches of Shazhou (i.e., the downstream of Sanzhangpu River) on the 26th, preventing the water from Sanzhangpu River from being discharged, threatening to flood tens of thousands of mu of land on both sides of Sanzhangpu River. Not satisfied, the residents of Shazhou blocked the southern end of the second branch. District Chief Shen Changjun was unable to stop them and telegraphed the county government for instructions on the 28th. After receiving the telegram, the county government considered the great importance of this action to the water conservancy of the interior and the potential for disputes. The county government immediately ordered the Public Security Bureau to instruct the Shazhou Public Security Sub-bureau to rush to the scene, demolish the dams that had been built, stop those who were building, and prohibit construction.</p>
<p>Yuanhua Township Again Suffers Robbery: Qin Jilun, a resident of Hebo Township in Yuanhua District in the southern part of the county, had considerable savings. Unexpectedly, at around 10:00 PM on the 26th, bandit boats arrived and landed in the area. They first went to the home of Qin Guanguan (Jilun's nephew). In a moment of desperation, Guanguan said, "I am a poor man. My uncle is rich, you can go there." The bandits followed him and arrived at the back door of Qin Jilun's home. Guanguan took the opportunity to escape. The bandits began to knock on the door. Jilun knew something was wrong and escaped from the roof. His wife, Huang, was dragged out of bed by the bandits and forced to reveal the location of the hidden money. When Huang refused to answer, the bandits beat her severely with sticks. Her son, Shisheng, was also beaten. As a result, they were robbed of over ninety yuan in cash, two gold rings, one gold bracelet, and clothing, etc. The trousseau that Huang had prepared for her daughter's upcoming wedding was also destroyed by the bandits. Afterwards, Jilun sent the injured Huang by boat to the Jisheng Hospital in the city for treatment. It is reported that her life is not in danger.</p>
<p>Notorious Bandit Zheng Yushan's Son Seeks Revenge for His Father: The town of Xiyang in Fushan is garrisoned by an anti-smuggling brigade to guard the sea entrance. Ever since the sea bandit leader Zheng Yushan was executed</p>
<p>, his son Zheng Ming has been constantly leading his gang to harass various towns in an attempt to retaliate. His踪跡 often have been found in Xiyang, Wangshi, and other towns. The troops stationed there have been closely guarding against him. At around 9:00 PM on the night before last (27th), the anti-smuggling team stationed in the town, led by Captain Zhang Xiuwen, patrolled the coast. Only two unarmed team members were left to guard the team post. Unexpectedly, at around 10:00 PM, over thirty pirates arrived by two sea-sand boats, landed with weapons, and surrounded the anti-smuggling post. Both guards were tied up and forced to reveal the location of the weapons. The guards replied that the team had taken them on patrol. The pirates had no choice but to leave, but the next morning, the pirates went to Xiyang again, intending to seize weapons from the anti-smuggling unit in the same way. Fortunately, the unit was alerted by the guards and was prepared, so it was not robbed. The pirates left angrily, but before leaving, the gang shouted, "We will not rest until we capture and execute Liu Zhiyi of the water police team who arrested Zheng Yushan!" Therefore, the unit has tightened security and also telegraphed its superiors, requesting additional troops to come to Changshu for defense.</p>

<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Robbery and Murder Case in Jiejingxu: The Shi Fuji family in Shijia Village, Jiejing, in the 5th district of the county (Tianshang City), recently had their fields flooded and the embankment collapsed. They were raising cash to find a way to remedy the situation. Unexpectedly, after 11:00 PM the night before last, the whole family was asleep when they suddenly heard many people banging wildly on the door. Shi suspected that neighbors were calling to protect the embankment, so he rushed to open the door and go outside. However, a dozen bandits rushed inside. One bandit pointed a gun at Shi Fuji, aiming to shoot. Shi hurriedly ran backward, and his wife, Wan, happened to be in the line of fire. The bullet hit her left breast, and she immediately bled profusely and died in a pool of blood. The bandits then searched and robbed at will, leaving only after an hour. Afterward, Fuji returned home and found his wife dead. Fortunately, his children were unharmed. He checked the stolen items and found that 130 yuan in banknotes and silver dollars, a gold ring, and more than a dozen pieces of clothing had been robbed. In his grief, he went to the city with Tu Zheng Zhou Longhui to report to the county and request an arrest.</p>
<p>Jiangyin Youth Attempts Suicide in Hotel: Fang Yao, from Jiangyin, came to Wuxi from Zhenjiang a few days ago and stayed in Room No. 1 of the Liangxi Hotel on Tongyun Road. In the evening, he ordered the tea room to fetch wine and drank heavily, and also bought five jiao worth of opium. He then wrote two letters, one to Staff Officer Chen of the Hankou Fortress Command and one to Yang Youfu (Fang's maternal uncle) of the Tongyu Caofang outside the North Gate of Jiangyin. After writing the letters, he personally went out to mail them. When he returned to the hotel after 10:00 PM, he closed the door and consumed all the opium and three pre-brought opium pills. He then wrote a letter to his sister-in-law, Fang Huizhen (wife of his fifth elder brother, Fang Juying), and a note to the hotel's accountant, before going to bed to await death. When dawn broke, the neighboring room heard severe moaning and informed the tea room attendant, Chen Gui, who then reported to the accountant. They opened the door and were shocked by what they saw. He was rushed to the hospital for treatment. Fortunately, the poisoning was not deep, and he gradually regained consciousness, so there was no danger to his life. Upon inquiry, it was learned that he took this drastic measure because of his poor circumstances and his previous failed attempts to deal with the anti-smoking investigation.</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Resolves on Anti-Japanese Aid to Overseas Chinese Measures: Yesterday, the county chamber of commerce, in response to the anti-Japanese aid to overseas Chinese issue, convened representatives from various industries to discuss the implementation methods.

All industries should actively participate and universally fly half-mast flags in mourning. (2) Stopping the import of Japanese goods: The chamber of commerce previously announced to various industries that they should follow Shanghai's procedures. Various industries have also automatically published advertisements to organize inspection teams and handle the registration of Japanese goods. Each trade association should be effectively responsible for starting inspections and immediately conducting investigations and registering Japanese goods. In the future, if any industry is found to be privately importing Japanese goods, the respective trade association should seal the goods and report them to the chamber of commerce for public discussion and strict punishment. (3) Providing relief funds for refugee overseas Chinese: The chamber of commerce will first raise and advance 500 silver dollars and immediately remit them to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce for forwarding, and will also print donation registers and distribute them to various industries for active fundraising.</p>
<p>Business Tax Loan is Extremely Urgent: The county business tax bureau, previously because the provincial government urged the payment of taxes urgently, had no way to raise the funds. The provincial government negotiated with the county chamber of commerce and decided to borrow 30,000 silver dollars as an emergency measure, to be repaid under the county's business tax item. Yang Wufu, the former director of the business tax bureau, received an order from the provincial government to first raise and repay 15,000 silver dollars to the chamber of commerce by the end of this month. After receiving the order, Director Yang immediately sent personnel to various industries to urge the payment of taxes. However, due to the decline in commerce and the occurrence of floods, it was difficult for various industries to raise the funds, so Director Yang was extremely anxious.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>

The autumn harvest was hopeless. Although the rain had subsided slightly, the river water was still rising. The Zhenjiang Xiaozhakou had not yet been blocked, and the river water was pouring in day and night. Farmers in more than a dozen counties below Danyang were bound to be left helpless and awaiting death. They urgently requested the provincial governor to quickly order the Construction Department to send personnel to block the Zhenjiang Xiaozhakou, which would greatly benefit 1.4 million farmers in Jiangnan.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Coal Ship Collides and Sinks Wheat Boat: The Tongjin steamship of the Shanghai Haitong Company, towing two iron barges, arrived in Zhenjiang from Shanghai and loaded coal at the Guazhou Zhongxing Company. This afternoon, after it had just finished loading, it first towed one barge out of the inland river. When it reached Chenjiawan, Guazhou, it collided with a barge due to the rapid water flow and unresponsive rudder. The barge, which was loaded with 150 bags of wheat from the Tongyitai firm, sank. Four or five other small boats were swept ashore due to the high water and crashed into the back wall of Xue Xie Mao's kitchen, injuring the owner's wife. Fortunately, her life was not in danger. The incident has been reported to Captain Ding of the Water Police Force, who ordered compensation to be paid.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>Kidnapping Case Occurs in Duxiang Township: The family of Huang Degui, a farmer in Duxiang Township, was suddenly visited by more than a dozen bandits the night before last. After robbing them, they kidnapped his eight-year-old grandson. They then went to the home of Song Guangliang, who lived nearby, and searched it. Because they didn't find much, they also took away his four-year-old son, fired their guns, and fled.</p>
<p>Yuanhe Qianzhuang Closes Down: The financial sector in this county has been severely hit by years of famine. This spring, Jiuda, Fukang, Henghe, Huikangyong, Huikang, and other firms closed down.

<h3>Qingjiang</h3>
<p>Two Bandit Alarms Recorded Together: Yu Kaifu, who has lived behind the Gongmao Supervision Station in Xiba Town, District 3 of Huaiyin, for many years, is not well-off. At 10:00 PM on the 23rd, six bandits suddenly carrying sharp weapons went to Yu's house to search and rob. Finally, they also abducted Yu Kaifu's wife. The town's Public Security First Branch and the Salt Affairs Escort Team heard the alarm and tried to rescue her, but the bandits had already fled southwest. Also, on the morning of the 25th, Deng Jiandi, the captain of the Second Squadron of the Huaiyin Police, reported to the brigade headquarters that Sun Huazeng, the town head of Lao Zhangji, and patrolman Wang Sichun had reported that the people in Lao Zhangji, Daxing'an, Zhangzhuang, Shazhuang, and other areas were fleeing to the county seat due to a large group of bandits from Shu. They requested that troops be sent to defend and suppress them. Commander Fu immediately sent personnel to Yugou Town, ordering Li Xiumin, the captain of the Third Squadron, to lead his team to assist.</p>
<p>Yellow Water Floods Sicheng Gate: The silted Yellow River in the old Tong Siyang county town usually has no water, and all the river beaches and riverbeds are used by local people to grow agricultural products. This year, the water volume has increased sharply, and the continuous rain has caused the silted Yellow River to be more than ten feet deep, flooding in all directions, gradually flowing inward from Simen. The people of Sicheng used cattail bags to hold soil and separately stacked the four city gates into small embankments. Therefore, the current situation in Siyang County can be described as being in the water.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing</h3>
<p>Provincial Loan Signing Scheduled: The 200,000 yuan provincial loan for the Shaoxing silver and money industry has been agreed upon by the county bureau director and representatives of the industry.

<h3>Mingguang</h3>
<p>Major Flooding on the Southern Section of the Jinpu Railway Destroys Roads: The southern section of the Jinpu Railway is relatively low-lying, and traffic is often affected when the river floods. Earlier this month, the Huai and Chi Rivers rose, flooding the tracks near Linhuai and south of Mingguang. At that time, vehicles could still pass by probing the water. Unexpectedly, the accumulated water had not yet receded when there was heavy rain again, and mountain floods rushed down, causing the river to rise again. In addition to Mingguang and Linhuai, which were still in their previous state, the road between Dongge and Huaqiying was washed away. Since the 26th, trains have been unable to pass. The railway bureau ordered workers to rush to repair it, but it was difficult to achieve results due to the deep water and rapid flow. Today, the southbound fifth-class ticket train was blocked in Chuzhou, and was subsequently changed to the sixth-class train to open north. After the first express train arrived in Bengbu, it was also changed to the second-class train and returned to Tianjin. According to railway news, if the road workers cannot repair it in time, the trains will be divided into two sections: Pukou to Huaqiying and Tianjin to Chuzhou, with ferries temporarily maintaining traffic in the middle. As for the flooded sections of the road around Mingguang and Linhuai, stones are currently being transported to build embankments to prevent any unexpected events.</p>
<h3>Fengtai</h3>
<p>Banditry Rampant Amidst Flooding: Fengtai in northern Anhui is located near the Huai River and has always been prone to flooding. Since the beginning of spring and summer, there has been continuous rain everywhere, and the rivers in Feng County have risen sharply. Low-lying areas have become wetlands, and embankments along the river have been broken in many places. The water in the plains is more than ten feet deep. Reed huts have collapsed, and stored grain and firewood have floated away with the water. Many people and animals have drowned, and the autumn harvest has been completely destroyed. The disaster victims are wailing and have no homes to return to. They sleep in the open air, exposed to the wind and eat meagerly, and their cries echo across the fields. It is truly tragic. Before the flood disaster has been relieved, banditry has risen again. The northeast townships of the county have always been areas where bandits are produced. Recently, several hundred bandits have gathered in the Tianjiaji area, occupying the place and being extremely rampant. Nearby villages have been looted, burned, and people have been kidnapped. They have done everything. A few days ago, many bandit ships suddenly arrived in Sujiagang and looted extensively, kidnapping several hostages, cutting off both ears of village head Su Qizhi, and shooting him in the water. It is terrible to hear. The bandits are now numerous and have threatened to attack Feng County. Upon receiving the report, the county authorities urgently convened a local emergency meeting to prepare for self-defense.</p>

<p>Since the Ministry of Education strictly reviewed the qualifications of school graduates, graduates of unregistered private schools are not qualified to enroll in higher education or serve in various institutions. Their qualifications are also affected when the Ministry of Personnel reviews them. However, schools that have been registered by the current Ministry of Education and the former Beijing Ministry of Education have verifiable records. For schools run in the former Qing Dynasty, it is quite difficult to verify them. The Ministry of Education has repeatedly approved inquiries from the Ministry of Personnel and the Examination Yuan regarding the qualifications and level of graduates from higher academies in various provinces. The Ministry of Education has verified the higher academies of various provinces registered by the Ministry of Education in the former Qing Dynasty based on the files of the Beiping Archives Preservation Office. They are listed below: Zhili Higher Academy (ceased operation in 1913), Shuntian Higher Academy (ceased operation in 1912), Fengtian Higher Academy (merged into the Politics and Law School in 1912, no graduates in regular courses), Imperial Clan Eight Banners Higher Academy (ceased operation in 1912), Jiangshi Higher Academy (ceased operation in 1911), Jiangsu Higher Academy (ceased operation in 1912), Anhui Higher Academy (ceased operation in 1914),</p>
<p>Jiangxi Higher Academy (ceased operation in 1912), Zhejiang Higher Academy (ceased operation in 1914), Fujian Higher Academy (ceased operation in 1914), Hunan Higher Academy (ceased operation in 1912), Sichuan Higher Academy (ceased operation in 1916), Henan Higher School (ceased operation in 1914), Henan Keji Higher Academy (no records in the Republic of China), Shandong Higher Academy (ceased operation in 1914), Shandong Keji Higher Academy (no records in the Republic of China), Gansu Higher Academy (ceased operation in 1912), Xinjiang Higher Academy (changed to a middle school in 1908 and did not offer higher regular courses), Guangdong Higher Academy (ceased operation in 1913), Shaanxi Higher Academy (ceased operation in 1912, no graduates in regular courses), Guangxi Higher Academy (ceased operation in 1914, no graduates in regular courses), Shaanxi Hongdao Higher Academy (only offered middle school classes and did not offer higher regular courses, changed to a middle industrial school in 1909), Yunnan Higher Academy (only offered middle school classes and did not offer higher regular courses), Manchu and Mongolian Higher Academy (established by the Ministry of Education in 1907), Zhibian Academy (graduates in 1911 were verified by the Ministry of Education and given awards according to the Legal and Political Special Department), Jing Shi Higher Industrial Academy established by the Ministry of Agriculture, Industry and Commerce (renamed National Industrial Vocational School after the founding of the Republic of China), Shanghai Higher Industrial Academy established by the Ministry of Posts and Communications (renamed Shanghai Industrial Vocational School of the Ministry of Communications after 1919), Jiangnan Higher Industrial Academy (ceased operation in 1913), Hunan Higher Industrial Academy (renamed Hunan Public Industrial Vocational School after the founding of the Republic of China), Fengtian Higher Industrial Academy (preparatory courses were offered first at the time of establishment, and in 1909 the Ministry of Education ordered the preparatory courses to be changed to a middle industrial school), Zhili Higher Industrial Academy (renamed Zhili Public Industrial Vocational School after the founding of the Republic of China), Liangguang Higher Industrial Academy (ceased operation in 1911, no higher graduates), Zhili Higher Agricultural Academy (renamed Zhili Public Agricultural Vocational School after the founding of the Republic of China), Hubei Higher Agricultural Academy (renamed Hubei Higher Agriculture and Forestry School after the founding of the Republic of China, ceased operation three years later), Shandong Higher Agricultural Academy (renamed Shandong Public Agricultural Vocational School after the founding of the Republic of China), Shanxi Higher Agriculture and Forestry Academy (Republic of China)</p>
<p>Renamed Shanxi Public Agricultural Vocational School), Jiangxi Higher Agricultural Academy (renamed Jiangxi Public Agricultural Vocational School after the founding of the Republic of China), Zhejiang Higher Agricultural Academy (no records in the Republic of China), Zhili Higher Commercial Academy (middle school classes were offered first at the time of establishment, renamed Zhili Public Commercial Vocational School after the founding of the Republic of China), Jiangnan Higher and Secondary Commercial Academy (attached special courses in banking and customs, graduates who completed three years of study were approved by the Ministry as equivalent to the Legal and Political Special Department, no records after 1913), Hunan Private Mingde Academy added a higher commercial specialized course (renamed Mingde University in the Republic of China and moved to Beijing). Explanation: (1) Except for Mingde Academy, which was private, the rest were all government-run. However, most of the seals used did not have the words "government-run." (2) Except for the Shuntian and Eight Banners Academies, which were established with the approval of the Ministry of Education, the rest were directly established with the approval of the various ministries or governors of the provinces. The existing old records of the academies have undergone reforms and relocations, and are no longer complete. Moreover, the period when the academies were established was mostly before the establishment of the Ministry of Education (the edict to establish the Ministry of Education was issued in the winter of 1905, and it was roughly established in 1906. Therefore, the Ministry of Education's files mostly date back to 1906 and cannot accurately determine the year in which each academy was registered. However, the establishment of regular courses in each academy was approved by the Ministry of Education. (3) All those called "Higher Academy of a certain province" (from Zhili to Yunnan), without the words "industrial," "agricultural," or "commercial," had a curriculum equivalent to a three-year university preparatory course. The admission qualifications were limited to middle school graduates, the length of study was three years, and the graduation awards were given the status of juren and a real official position (those ranked highest were given the position of secretary of the Grand Secretariat for domestic use, or prefect for external use; those ranked excellent were given the position of secretary of the Secretariat Department for domestic use, or county magistrate for external use; those ranked average were given the position of department director of the ministry or temple for domestic use, or sub-prefect for external use). Also, in the former Qing Dynasty, this type of higher academy was also an independent academy. Its admission qualifications, length of study, and graduate treatment were the same as those of higher industrial academies or higher industrial and commercial academies. After the establishment of the Republic of China, the education system was revised, and the Ministry of Education instructed all provinces to send students of this type of higher academy to the national university preparatory course or to continue until graduation. Therefore, this type of higher academy mostly ceased operation in the early years of the Republic of China. However, in the early years of the Republic of China, the university preparatory course still used a three-year system. In 1917, the length of the university undergraduate course was extended and the length of the university preparatory course was shortened to two years, and this type of school disappeared. In short, this type of higher academy and the three-year university preparatory course, in terms of qualifications and length of study, were equivalent to vocational schools, but in terms of curriculum, they were not vocational in nature. Compared to the current high school system, they were superior (the former Qing Dynasty middle school was five years, plus three years of higher academy, for a total of eight years, so it was superior to the current high school system). (4) All higher industrial academies and higher agricultural, industrial, and commercial academies had specialized curricula. The admission qualifications were limited to middle school graduates, and the length of study was three years, except for the agricultural department of the Higher Agricultural Academy, which was four years, while the forestry department was still three years. The graduation awards were given the status of juren and a real official position. After the founding of the Republic of China, in addition to being renamed various vocational schools in accordance with regulations, most of the others for which there were no records in the Republic of China had ceased operation.</p>

<h3>Ministry Orders Schools to Admit Students from Differentiated Shanghai Schools</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education issued a circular to the education departments of all provinces and cities, instructing schools to admit students from unregistered and closed private colleges in Shanghai who have undergone differentiation.

<h3>Record of the City No. 1 Field Amateur Tennis Tournament</h3>
<p>Yesterday, eight games were played in the amateur tennis competition at the City No. 1 Public Sports Field. Among them, the battle between Sun Chuanxin and Dai Zisheng of the Shen group was the most exciting. Dai was good at blocking, and Sun was good at topspin. Back and forth, the number of games increased mutually. In the first set, it went straight to 9-7 before Sun Chuanxin took the victory. In the second set, both players felt tired, and the momentum was not as strong as before. Dai Zisheng's defense on the left side was particularly sparse, so Sun Chuanxin defeated him again 6-1. The results of yesterday's game are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲Yesterday's Game Results</p>
<p>Group Player Win/Loss Score</p>
<p>Xin Zhu Qiqing Won Ke Cunfeng 6-3 6-4</p>
<p>Xia Chongdeyao Won Jiang Zhongquan 6-3 6-1</p>
<p>Shen Gong Zhenyi Won Cao Wenying 6-2 6-4</p>
<p>Shen Sun Chuanxin Won Dai Zisheng 9-7 6-1</p>
<p>Xin Tang Zhongguang Won Xiao Mingzu 6-2 6-1</p>
<p>Xia Chen Jinshou Won Chongdeyao 6-1 6-2</p>
<p>Ling Chen Yonghua Won Wang Huanqing 6-0 7-5</p>
<p>Sai Tang Shaoyun Won Ye Jingzao 6-3 7-5</p>
<p>Net Fei Chufang Won Gu Ruxi 5-7 6-2</p>
<p>Also, the battle between Gong Zhenyi and Cao Wenying yesterday was extremely remarkable. Gong was experienced in battle and did not panic, earning the final victory. Although Cao Wenying's offensive was unfavorable, his counterattack positions were excellent and often fatal to the enemy. Unfortunately, he was not accustomed to the field and had difficulty coping. We cannot judge heroes by success or failure.</p>
<h3>Rotary International Cup and Exhibition Tennis Match Sponsored by the Chinese National Sports Association</h3>

<h3>Strange Stone Artifacts of Chengdu</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yan</p>
<p>▲Stone abacus can be used for calculation ▲Stone instruments can be played</p>
<p>About twenty miles outside the West Gate of Chengdu, there is a place called Wujia Linzi in Xipu Field. The area is lush with trees and the scenery is beautiful and secluded. Amidst the green trees, there is a stone dwelling built by a certain person's individual effort. The beams, rafters, walls, window lattices, and lintels are all made of stone, with exquisite carvings and unique ingenuity. The fish, insects, flowers, birds, beasts, and flying fowl carved on the walls are all lifelike and seem to leap and live. The most peculiar thing is that the stone abacus carved on the wall has beads that can all move, and a dry tobacco pipe can be filled with tobacco and smoked. There is also a birdcage carved, protruding from the stone surface, with a stone trough and a stone platform inside. A bird stands on the platform, opening its mouth and flapping its wings as if to sing. There is also a stone lion, with hair patterns all over its body like silk, thin and delicate. The eyes are bright and full of spirit. The lion's mouth holds a ball. When you probe it with your hand, although it can rotate freely, you can never take it out. What is even more peculiar is that on the stone railing pillars of the garden fishpond, each top is carved with a fat baby, some holding sheng, some holding conch shells, some holding flutes, and some holding whistles. When tourists blow them, they can all make sounds one by one. Musicians can even play them with ups and downs, it is said.</p>
<h3>New Method of Nourishing Qi and Killing Mosquitoes</h3>
<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>▲A Major Invention by American Scientists</p>
<p>The season of lotus and summer has arrived. Mosquitoes and insects are most easily bred, disturbing people's work and invading people's sweet dreams. They are annoying. We have no way to eliminate them. Now, Cornell University in the United States has contributed a new method of catching mosquitoes for us. If we adopt this method, all mosquitoes and insects will not be difficult to eliminate completely. We can work safely and sleep soundly. Isn't that pleasant? Where there are larvae in lakes and swamps, it is where mosquitoes breed. However, these larvae can be captured and destroyed by using oxygen (oxygen). Oxygen is indispensable for the lives of various animals, but now it can kill mosquitoes. Isn't that strange? The experimental site is in the forest within Cornell's borders. There is a pond. Since using oxygen to kill mosquitoes, mosquitoes have disappeared. It has been several years. It is said that in ponds where mosquitoes breed, there must be a kind of aquatic plant called Chara. It grows on the bottom of the water, and mosquito eggs parasitize on it. Later, Dr. Mason and Professor Hugh Mun of Cornell University discovered that once mosquito eggs parasitize on this plant, all oxygen bubbles gradually disappear. Therefore, after the female mosquito lays eggs, this plant still grows, and larvae are not produced. However, after withering, mosquito colonies can breed. From this alone, it can be seen that the presence or absence of oxygen has a considerable relationship with the reproduction of mosquito eggs. Therefore, several glass jars were used, filled with water, half containing oxygen bubbles and half without. Mosquito food was also placed in the jars, and 50 larvae were placed in the jars. After a few days, mosquitoes were formed in the jars without oxygen bubbles in turn, while those with oxygen bubbles died completely. Over time, the mosquito killing rate of oxygen reached 100%. It can be seen that oxygen is sufficient to kill mosquitoes. Now the doctors are doing further research to use oxygen bubbles to completely kill the larvae in the pond, so that mosquitoes cannot grow. However, the principle of oxygen killing mosquitoes has not yet been reported in detail by them.</p>
<h3>A Cooling Off Record at Wuyou Park</h3>
<p>— Zhe Cun</p>
<p>The location for cooling off in the hot summer does not necessarily have to be a tall building, a waterside pavilion, or a windy pavilion. It only needs to be a place between the village and the suburbs, where land is developed and houses are built, with three parts water and two parts bamboo. However, the more trees there are, the better. Sitting and whistling in it, one feels quiet, clean, and free from worldly dust, making it the best place to escape the summer heat. Wuyou Park is located in the northwest corner of the town, close to the west bank of the Chuanchang River, covering an area of about sixty or seventy acres. It is surrounded by lively clear water, and a bow-shaped plank bridge leads to it. There is a bridge pavilion on it, with railings decorated in blue and white. The tree shade on the left and right of the park gate sometimes brushes the bridge body. From a distance, it is picturesque. There are thousands of trees, mostly elm, willow, pine, and locust trees. They are all more than several feet high, circling the park in an unbroken intertwining manner. A three-bay Matsutake Pavilion is built in the north to receive the southern breeze. A pond is located dozens of steps in front of the Matsutake Pavilion, with various aquatic plants planted in it. To the west is the Mo'an Villa, surrounded by short trees, as if it were a separate path, with silk and bamboo instruments and chess boards for recreation. To the south, there is a high mound with a pavilion built on it, formerly called the Zuiweng Pavilion, but now renamed the Zhongshan Pavilion. Climbing up and viewing the scenery, both near and far, can be counted. The roads in the park are winding and circular, with tall trees on both sides of the road. Tourists walking in it are like opening an umbrella, almost forgetting the suffering of the scorching heat on the dusty road. A few plots of land are also divided for gardeners to cultivate, making one feel a sense of farming in the flowers and trees, and a sense of mountains and forests in the mortal world. This is what Liu Zihou meant by "looking at its planting, it is clear, beautiful, spreading, and comfortable; looking at its storage, it is melting, rippling, and winding." The villagers have recently proposed to expand the construction. In the future, it can be more perfect. Although I have been a native of this town for generations, I am lazy to travel. The other day, I went for a walk alone and stayed for a short time. There are also people selling tea and snacks inside, which is very convenient for tourists. I sat silently for a while, and a long wind suddenly came, and the surroundings sounded like waves, or like a waterfall, or like a stream. It was sometimes mixed with the sound of tea being brewed. At this moment, all worldly worries disappeared, and I seemed to have entered a cool country. I got a sentence: "Walking along the dike, tired of traveling, I took a short stay in the shade of green trees. Fish and birds are close to people and all feel comfortable. From time to time, I hear the sound of splashing and hooks." Near the end of June, Xinwei, I returned and wrote it down, hoping not to forget the traces of my footsteps at that time.</p>
<h3>A Few Questions</h3>
<p>— Mei Er</p>
<p>A ethicist came up with a few questions as follows. "A hard-working parents gave birth to a romantic son, who married a virtuous daughter-in-law. What is this family like?"</p>
<p>"A singer admired by thousands of people. A is willing to marry her. B is willing to marry her. C and D are also willing to marry her. In the end, which kind of person should she choose as her life partner?"</p>
<p>"The singer chose a romantic teenager after thousands of selections. Later, the teenager's original wife suddenly ran to the door. Please teach me how to deal with it."</p>
<p>"On the one hand, he bragged to his lover about how rich he was, but he happened to run into his original wife and his father. In an helpless situation, how should he deal with it?"</p>
<p>"The facts were exposed. The wife knew that her husband was having an affair. What else would she do?"</p>
<p>"The facts were exposed. Qingren knew that the person she chose was a big bastard. What else would she do?"</p>
<p>"When people die, will things be over?"</p>
<p>The above many questions are not imagined out of thin air, but are produced on a fact. However, its answer is by no means imaginable by smart readers. Now, Tianyi Film Company has decided to solve these many problems in order to make the first domestic film movie. On the surface, the urban life is written vividly, making people feel novel and lively when they see it. But in essence, its lesson is worthy of being seen by the entire Chinese people. What exactly does a story inside satirize? There are enthusiastic and sad songs in the film, romantic and intense dances, and moving and funny twists and turns of the bizarre layout. Although its premiere is still pending, its name is "Song Market Spring Colors." It is worth remembering. Wait and see how it solves the above problems in the future.</p>
<h3>Travel Notes from India (70)</h3>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>In India, all Hindus will celebrate a two-day festival starting tomorrow, and a meeting is held tonight. Men and women gather together. Carpets are laid on the ground. The ceremony of scattering flower garlands is performed first. I also participate. A class leader leads the recitation of ancient Sanskrit poems. Wood is burned in a basin, and oil is poured onto it while reciting. It seems to be a custom of worshipping fire. Then, a large group of students sing, led by one student. He sings a phrase first, then everyone sings together. The sound is clear, melodious, and transcendent. I don’t know what song it is. It is accompanied by drums. Then, music is played. Each person sings folk songs in various languages at will. They also invite me to recite Chinese poems, which they greatly appreciate. When I listen to Indian music, songs, and poems, I don’t understand the words, but I appreciate the sounds. In general, they are beyond what China can achieve. The beauty stems from diligent learning. Their Buddhist and Brahman philosophy is already higher than human understanding. When this is expressed in music and songs, the tones are lofty and transcendent, incomparable to the mundane world. In China, the highest form of song is the Ya and Song sections of the Three Hundred Songs, which are about the way of kings. Going further back to the times of Tang and Yu, it reaches the way of emperors. Only immortals can play music that transcends the ordinary, comparable to a part of Indian music. But its vastness and profundity are beyond China's realm. Try listening to the chants of monks; they can transport people to other realms. If the songs of Chu in China could be set to music, their realm would also be very high. After the students sing, they distribute sugar and perform the red dot on the forehead ceremony. They also put a dot on my forehead. Finally, they sing a patriotic song and disperse. The moonlit night is exceptionally beautiful. The educator, Narun Yesha, wishes success to the Asian Cultural Union.</p>
<p>After the meeting ends, the students gather to discuss the future of Asia and the Gandhian movement. Gandhi's title is "Mahatma," the same word used to refer to the Buddha in the past. The Buddha was also called "Mahatma." The students say that according to Hindus, the Buddha was the ninth Buddha, and Gandhi is the tenth Buddha. I ask about Gandhi's policies and the effectiveness they have achieved among the people. The students say that Indians have no weapons, so they focus on economic efforts. There are three strategies: First, not using foreign goods. The annual savings are already in the hundreds of millions. British merchants are in great difficulty, and some are demanding that the British government grant Indians freedom to restore trade. This shows their predicament. Second, strikes. Not providing services to foreigners for any projects. The British must have Indians do everything. This is not easy to achieve, only a part can be done. Third, tax resistance. This is very difficult. In Gugrat, a city near Mumbai, Gandhi's hometown, they are working hard on tax resistance. The police burned their houses and killed their people, so people abandoned their fields and fled. This movement is happening everywhere, but it has not yet been very successful. However, the police are all Indians and are gradually showing signs of going slow. Even the soldiers are gradually showing signs of being slow. Over time, they will gain the sympathy of everyone, and changes will naturally occur. Many women and children are joining the movement. In short, tax resistance is happening everywhere. The British cannot arrest so many people. This strategy is very important. If they can cut off the British economic source, the troops cannot be supported, and the power of the government will gradually weaken. This is Gandhi's movement strategy. In any case, Indians will fight for freedom until death, and will not stop until they get freedom.</p>
<p>Rotary Club Lecture</p>
<h3>Women, Women (5)</h3>
<p>— Yao Suifeng</p>
<p>The young shop assistant spoke as he walked. Mr. Lu did not say a word, silently following behind him as he entered. The people inside heard the sounds from outside and hurried out. With the same surprise, they said, "Xiao Rong! Is that you back?"</p>
<p>Mr. Lu awkwardly uttered the proper form of address: "Dad! Mom!" He handed the bunch of bananas he was carrying to his mother. His mother was extremely happy. She saw that her son had grown up so much, even though he had only been gone for less than half a year. But it seemed as if he had brought back boundless happiness. His father was naturally very happy as well because he had worked hard for most of his life, placing all his hopes on his son. He usually silently prayed that his son would study hard so that he could honor his ancestors and bring glory to the family. Now that his son had returned from school, although he had not yet graduated, his hopes seemed to have taken a further step, a deeper level.</p>
<p>Once inside the house, his mother busily wiped a chair with her sleeve, telling him to sit down. She also hurriedly called for tea to be poured, water to be boiled, and snacks to be bought. She treated him earnestly, as if he were a distinguished guest. Meanwhile, his father also felt at a loss for words, haphazardly asking about the situation at school: "Is the schoolwork busy? Are there many classmates?..."</p>
<p>Mr. Lu not only forgot to ask his parents, "Are you well?" and "Is business good?" but he also forgot someone else until he saw someone carrying a bowl of noodles out of the kitchen. He seemed stunned.</p>
<p>With the same surprise, she said, "Xiao Rong! Is that you back?"</p>
<p>He really did not want to see this last person who came out, his wife of three years. But he managed to change his contemptuous expression into one that seemed very gentle, and he said, "How are you? Are you at home?"</p>
<p>"It's been raining for several days, business is very slow, I haven't gone out for two days, I didn't expect you to be back!" She revealed the most joyful expression, as if she had received infinite comfort from her husband.</p>
<p>So she sat down, and the bowl of noodles was delivered from her hands to her husband's face. "You must be hungry! If it's not enough, there's more!" she said with a smile.</p>
<p>"Is it too bland? Do you want some soy sauce?" She was still speaking attentively. She stood up and took a basin and brought out some water.</p>
<p>Mr. Lu took one bite and stopped eating. He said, "I'm very full, I can't eat any more!"</p>

The maximum price for the day was 46 taels and seven mace, and the minimum price was 36 taels and five, with a difference of 10 taels and two mace.</p>

<h3>Government Bond Delivery, Foreign Exchange Trading Especially Active</h3>
<p>▲ Li Price Plummets by More Than One Li, Afternoon Market Rebounds</p>
<p>▲ Market Overview: In recent years, the financial sector has, in view of the economic depression and the lack of viable real estate projects, turned to speculation and investment in government bonds. Therefore, during the month-end delivery period, foreign chips enter and exit in a chaotic manner, and the amount increases day by day. Yesterday was another customary delivery day, and all futures contracts for July had to be settled in cash. Therefore, mortgages and buy/sell orders had to be cleared, resulting in especially high foreign exchange trading and a consequent drop in the Li price.</p>
<p>▲ Li Exchange Rates (Foreign Li): Early market trading was exceptionally active, with intense competition. As a result, sellers were overcrowded, and the Li price plummeted by slightly more than one and a half Li, to 7 qian 2 fen 3 li 6 hao 2 hu and a half. The afternoon market was slightly firmer, and the closing price improved by half a Li compared to the early market, to 7 qian 2 fen 4 li 1 hao 2 hu and a half. (Silver Discount): Early and afternoon markets both opened at 6 fen. The silver market eased, and there was no market for adding water to the head, so it was a "white draw." However, there were still 4-5 fen trades in the middle.</p>
<p>▲ Subsidiary Coin Market Conditions: Jiangnan small coins were still at 6 qian 5 fen in the early market, and fell by a small 1 li in the afternoon market, to 6 qian 4 fen 9 li, with transactions made. Early market: 6,000 jiao; afternoon market: 2,000 jiao. Guangdong small coins were at 6 qian 4 fen 2 li in the early market and 6 qian 4 fen 2 li and a half in the afternoon market, with transactions made. Early market: 150,000 jiao; afternoon market: 50,000 jiao. Copper coins increased again by 1,500 wen, to 381,000 wen, which has already exceeded the 80,000 wen mark.</p>
<p>▲ Silver Inflow and Outflow (Silver Funds): Yesterday's bank collections and disbursements were due to the approaching end of the month, with various settlements urgently needing to be cleared, and there were also many bill funds. Huashang collected and disbursed more than 3.3 million bill funds, foreign merchants 2.3-2.4 million, settlement collections and disbursements slightly above 3 million, and various cargo exchange tax and miscellaneous collections and disbursements 13.2-1.33 million, warehouse withdrawals 1.4 million. Japanese banks collected and disbursed various funds of more than 5.4 million, settlement collections and disbursements 700-800,000, warehouse inflows 500,000. Qianzhuang Yin Gong collected and disbursed more than 48.8 million, drew on head fund collections and disbursements of more than 5.7 million, various route exchange funds of more than 1.1 million, collected in cash 800-900,000. (Foreign Funds): Exchange bill funds made in the early market 6.135 million, in the afternoon market 2.365 million, totaling a huge 8.5 million in both markets. Banknotes: 75,000 in the early market, 100,500 in the afternoon market. Outside the market banknotes, 195,000 in the early market, 155,000 in the afternoon market. Bank trading was especially abundant, with interbank trading of 3.9 million in the early market and 1.95 million in the afternoon market. Various bank foreign accounts traded collections and disbursements of more than 4.4 million, banknote inflows and outflows of 220-230,000, Qianzhuang Yang Gong collected and disbursed more than 14 million, drew on head funds for more than 6.3 million, borrowed foreign funds and disbursed over 2.3 million. Also, bank foreign mortgage trading was 3-4 million, small Qianzhuang trading was more than 900,000. As for customer routes, there was no news, so the Li market felt weaker, and prices fell sharply.</p>
<h3>Securities: Government Bond Delivery Conditions for July</h3>
<p>▲ Total Delivery Amount Reaches 43.27 Million</p>
<p>Yesterday, the local Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange suspended trading due to the handling of futures delivery for July. Although the number of July futures deliveries for various bonds was not as large as that for June, it still reached 43.27 million yuan. Among them, 20 Guan still accounted for 1.11 million, 19 Guan 7.8 million, 19 Shan, 20 Juan, Disarmament, and Reorganization also had 4-5 million each. Excluding the approximately 30 million that had been cleared on Tuesday, there were still 13.69 million that were actually delivered yesterday. The delivery process was quite smooth. Today, the Securities Exchange will open as usual, and new trading of September futures will begin at the same time. The July futures delivery and clearance numbers for each bond are listed below (unit: yuan):</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Spot Yarn and Cotton on Delivery Day</h3>
<p>▲ Spot Yarn Sales Still Brisk: The yarn market is calm, with a relatively firm trend. Due to relatively good actual sales, sentiment is tight. Japanese yarn is more active than before, but futures yarn is suspended due to month-end delivery. Customers bought a total of 950 bales throughout the day. Dealers bought 250 bales, with prices rising by two mace and a half. Tianjin bought 100 bales, Qingdao bought 100 bales, domestic gangs bought 160 bales, Yunnan gangs bought 130 bales, Xuzhou bought 75 bales, Guangdong bought 50 bales, Shantou bought 50 bales, Hankou bought 50 bales, and miscellaneous gangs bought 150 bales.</p>
<p>▲ No Spot Cotton Trading: Futures cotton is suspended due to month-end delivery, but there is no spot cotton trading. The world cotton market is trending downwards step by step, and the situation is very weak. Although the local market is calm, there are no special features to mention. The weather has cleared up recently, and the global trend is downward, so it may not be easy to turn around in the short term.</p>
<h3>Foreign Yarn and Cotton Still Lack Improvement</h3>
<p>▲ American, Indian, and British Cotton Prices Continue to Fall: Yesterday, American cotton was initially weak due to good weather and a sluggish Wall Street, but later rebounded slightly due to some short covering.

<h3>July Marked Yarn Settlement Process</h3>
<p>▲ Settlement Price 164 Taels... Volume 9,100 Bales</p>
<p>July marked yarn originally had the power to rise because the northern route genuinely needed large-scale development, morale was good, and the situation was gradually improving. Unexpectedly, a certain merchant took advantage of the rising price to sell off a large quantity, reversing the market, and creating a rather unstable situation. The price fell from 162-3 taels to below 57 taels, which shows the heavy pressure from large households. Before long, the Wanbaoshan Incident was discovered, causing considerable damage to Korean residents. Economic severance with Japan and patriotic movements became increasingly heated. Refusal of goods began as a result. The spot yarn market became very tight, and prices rose slightly. 42-count fine yarn surged by dozens of taels, and people were shocked. Speculators flocked in, and buying sentiment pervaded the market. The rising trend intensified, and the price even broke through 60 taels outside the customs, reaching a maximum of 164 taels and 6 mace. However, certain manufacturers continued to sell, while another manufacturer bought low and went long. The two sides were evenly matched. In the final round, the bid was raised to 5 taels, but because large households sold again, it went lower, resulting in 4 taels. The settlement price was 164 taels, with a remainder of 9,100 bales, of which 4,500 bales were actually settled, and the rest were settled independently. This included 100 bales of 10-count Red Kuixing, 1,500 bales of Cai Kuixing, 50 bales of Golden Rooster, 900 bales of Hongfu, 1,350 bales of Three Sheep, 700 bales of Shi Yi, 100 bales of Earth, 50 bales of Fugui, and 200 bales of Red Lotus Bee. Both parties in the settlement were manufacturers. The numbers and bale amounts of each firm are recorded below:</p>

<h3>Overview of July Chinese Marked Yarn Settlement</h3>
<p>▲ Settlement Price 38 Taels... Volume 30,100 Piculs</p>
<p>At the beginning of the month, the market sentiment for July Chinese marked yarn was unusually soft, mainly because the overseas cotton market was weak and sluggish, and the price of gold was also fluctuating, which made people more apprehensive. The actual needs of various factories were sluggish and there was no digestion at all. Moreover, the yarn market was trending downward, so the market presented a situation of hesitation, between 38 and 39 taels. However, Japanese merchants continued to drag in a long position and did not relax. Later, due to poor yarn prices and unstable American cotton, the market broke through the 9-fen mark, and morale once became weak, reaching a low of 37 taels and 2 mace. Subsequently, as Japanese merchants took delivery, the market rebounded slightly. In the end, the price of the last round was 38 taels, the settlement price was 38 taels, and the remainder was 30,100 piculs. The goods were of two types: Shaanxi and Huoji flower. Shenchang delivered 6,600 piculs, Hengyi 4,100 piculs, and Xinxing 2,500 piculs, which was the most. Gongtai received 7,300 piculs, Tianlong 1,500 piculs, and Rongxing 1,800 piculs, which was the most. The numbers and picul amounts of each firm are recorded below:</p>

<h3>Grains: Changshu &amp; Wuxi Early Season Japonica Rice Bids Up by Half a Yuan</h3>
<p>▲ Due to hoarding in warehouses</p>
<p>▲ Xin Zha: Yesterday, boats from inland areas, including Wuxi, Jiangyin, Changzhou, Yixing, Tongli, Shipu, Xitang, etc., numbered seventeen or eighteen. Trading in the market was initially sluggish but then became active. Changshu and Wuxi early season Japonica rice slightly increased in warehouses, estimated at two to three thousand piculs. Prices bid up by 5 jiao. Early and late rice were sold as soon as they arrived, so the trend tightened by 3 jiao. Tongbian and Yinhua types opened steadily. Luyang Jian and Bu Jian rice were slow to move. The market trend was high because foreign rice was still weak, following lower by a few jiao.</p>
<p>▲ South Market: Yesterday, sources from various gangs arrived infrequently, mainly from Pinghu and Nangang gangs. Retail sales in urban and rural stores were not active. Thick Japonica rice arrived and sales were slow, and the price remained the same. Only five or six boats of thin rice arrived, and sales were not active. There was a slight outlet in this street, and the price did not rise or fall. Luyang Jian rice was not popular, and the price was lower by one or two jiao. It is said that foreign rice is being used to supply military rations, so there is some movement, and the price has hardened by half a yuan.</p>
<h3>The Flour Market Situation is Severe Before Settlement</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market situation was still very severe. Because there was only one trading day this month, short sellers outside the industry had to cover their positions according to the trend. Because spot goods could be bid up, manufacturers were unwilling to deliver more. Buyers were very firm, and there was no short squeeze on the 29th. Forward months were still being bought up by inland gangs, and the highest price rose by more than 2 fen compared to the previous day. However, because Fuxin, Fufeng, Xinda, and other factories were selling off, it fell by 1 fen, but it was still better than the closing price of the previous day. As a result, this month rose by 2.5 fen compared to the previous day, August by 1.75 fen, September by 1 fen, October by 1.5 fen, November by 1.25 fen, and December by 0.5 fen.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Rose in the Morning and Fell in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Due to rumors of more foreign wheat being contracted, with three or four ships.</p>
<p>Spot wheat arrivals are not numerous, bidding up by three or four fen.</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of wheat futures, the market for each month, although the weather caused absorption, the near and far months were better by three or four fen than the previous day. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, the opening prices for each month fell sharply again. It was rumored that two major factories, so and so, had successively contracted three or four ships of Australian No. 3 wheat at a combined price of 4 taels, 2 mace, and 6 fen, causing people to panic and fall back down. September fell by as much as 9 fen compared to the highest price in the morning. Given this situation, if the standard price is excessively raised, it will give foreign wheat more opportunities to increase its imports to China. As a result, August fell by 2 fen compared to the previous day, September fell by 6 fen, October fell by 3 fen, November fell by 1 fen, and December did not move. Because spot wheat arrivals are not numerous and the producing areas are also rising step by step, each grade has also been bid up by three or four fen. As a result, Shuangfeng wheat was 3 taels, 6 mace, and 8 fen, followed by 3 taels, 5 mace, and 5 fen, 3 taels, 5 mace, and 9 fen, and Danyang wheat was 3 taels and 7 mace, totaling 2,500 bags, which were reportedly purchased by Fuxin, Huafeng, and Xinda.</p>
<h3>July Soybean Futures Short Squeeze Temporarily Ceased</h3>
<p>▲ Settled at a price of 5 taels, 4 mace, and 5 fen.</p>
<p>Dalian soybeans were supposed to be auctioned until yesterday, but because of the short squeeze in this month, the auction was stopped the day before yesterday. The long side, after discussing with the directors and relevant brokers, settled all short accounts at a price of 5 taels, 4 mace, and 5 fen. It is said that this short squeeze was not intentional, but because the receiver was reportedly a manufacturer, and the short accounts were all outsiders, with no goods to deliver, they had to suffer an invisible loss.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Zhenmei Green Tea Trading is Brisk</h3>
<p>Yesterday, English and French firms were actively searching for Zhenmei green tea from Wuyuan, Tunxi, and other areas. Trading was unusually brisk, and the market was slightly firmer than before. Currently, there are few low-grade Zhenmei teas left on the market, and there are only a little over ten thousand boxes of medium and high-grade goods. Chinese tea merchants are taking a firm stance, and the market price is expected to rise. The stock of Zhenmei and Xiumei teas is thin, and the selling price has continued to rise by three or four taels. However, Russian firms have not yet started to purchase Gongxi tea, and Baitu Zhuang tea is not very popular, which has affected green tea somewhat.</p>
<h3>Chinese Silk Merchants Unanimously Refuse to Use Japanese Cocoons</h3>
<p>This year, both spring and summer silkworm crops in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have had surprisingly good harvests. The raw materials of silk factories in various ports have long been insufficient for reeling, so they are all promoting farmers to raise autumn silkworms to make up for the shortage. However, because Japanese merchants believe that this year's cocoon production in their country is still abundant and the cocoon price is not cheap, they are all transporting large quantities of Japanese cocoons to China for sale. Since the start of economic severance with Japan, Japanese merchants have been trying to sell large quantities of Japanese cocoons stored in Yokohama and other ports. Because Chinese silk merchants are eager to be patriotic, they have already decided to unanimously refuse to use Japanese cocoons. Therefore, recently, no one has inquired about Japanese cocoons. As a result, they will still be transported back to Japan or transferred to other countries for sale.</p>
<h3>Foreign Firms' Silk Sales are Lifeless</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the overseas market for Chinese silk was all quotations and no sales. Telegrams were not forwarded, and the market was sluggish. Yesterday, only Xinfu and others imported 15 bales of Baiqian silk, and Meida and others imported 8 bales of Huangcu silk. The prices were all firm.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Coarse Cloth Gradually Rises</h3>
<p>▲ East goods are still being shipped out every day... the selling price has risen instead.</p>
<p>▲ Local Cloth: The price has risen very quickly in recent days, mainly because the boycott of Japanese goods is becoming increasingly tense, and the sales of Chinese goods have suddenly become smooth. Coarse cloth is particularly firm and expensive. Yesterday, 9-pound cloth was 5 taels and 2 mace leaving the customs, and 10-pound Blue Chicken had reached 5 taels and 5 mace. 11-pound goods, Jardine Matheson's Three Deer, Three Rabbit, and Three Cat were all 5 taels, 7 mace, and 5 fen. 16-pound Five Crane and Peony were all over 8 taels and 1 mace. Fine cloth Chinese goods are very scarce. Fine twill Jincheng has sold for 8 taels, 2 mace, and 5 fen, and Butterfly Ball for 7 taels, 7 mace, and 5 fen. However, fine cloth and fine twill from Japanese factories have not fallen at all, because although inspections have been implemented in Shanghai, foreign ports have not yet boycotted them, and there are still many transactions.</p>
<p>▲ East and West Piece Goods: Yesterday, both the quoted and Zhuang goods of Western goods rose by three or four qian. However, there is an abnormal shortage of ordinary colors in the market, so East goods are still secretly active. Many are being shipped out for export every day. Not only has the price not fallen, but it has risen instead. Yesterday, Yuehua velvet was shipped away by the Changjiang Gang in large quantities. Large pattern velvet was 2 qian, 4 fen, and 7.5 li, and medium pattern was 2 qian, 3 fen, and 7.5 li. Black flower is out of stock, and it is difficult to find printed Zhigong Ni. Double Military Fine Twill has already left the customs for 10 taels. Zhigong Ni and Zhigong satin, if there are spot goods, are being shipped out every day. Therefore, it is difficult to predict the next step in the short term.</p>
<h3>Metals: Tinplate Sells Well to Tobacco Companies</h3>
<p>Yesterday, tinplate trading suddenly became brisk. For example, tobacco companies have suddenly greatly increased their purchases recently, so the standard price has suddenly risen. 90-pound English goods sold for 14 taels and 5 mace, 100-pound for 16 taels, 90-pound American goods for 16 taels, 100-pound for 17 taels, and 200-pound for 30 taels, zero 7 mace and 5 fen. It is said that over 1,600-700 boxes were opened in the market yesterday.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous News: 340 Pieces of Huzhou Silk Filaments Shipped to France</h3>
<p>▲ 12,000 bags of wheat flour loaded for Shantou and Xiamen</p>
<p>▲ 4,800 bags of raw peanuts shipped to Guangzhou</p>

Unexpectedly, rebellious warlords have taken the opportunity to create chaos, remotely colluding with Japanese imperialism and the wicked Red bandits, disregarding the nation's survival and the people's welfare. All citizens of Shanghai should recognize that the Red bandits, warlords, and Japanese imperialism are the obstacles to our national revolution and the irreconcilable enemies of our 400 million compatriots.

<p>▲Declaration of the Assembly: The Assembly resolved to issue a declaration, which read: "For several years, the Chinese Communist Party, under the wings of red imperialists, has run rampant, especially in Hunan and Jiangxi provinces, which have suffered the most. In total, over 260,000 civilian lives have been lost, over 260,000 houses have been burned, and property losses are close to 100 million yuan. Moreover, in the areas affected by the Red scourge, all means of production have been destroyed, and even if the people are fortunate enough to escape slaughter, they cannot avoid being displaced, starving, and dying. We absolutely do not believe that this kind of inhuman brutality has any kind of doctrine as its goal, but is merely a return to the most barbaric and cruel banditry in history. Moreover, because it is subject to the influence of red</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Citizens' Assembly (Photo by Our Newspaper)</h3>
<p>To allow the avarice of color-obsessed imperialists to run rampant, mixed with bandits, is to certainly utterly destroy the people's livelihood, the society's existence, the nation's economy, the masses' lives, even to the point of national extinction and racial annihilation. Such a tragic outcome, anyone with even a little national thought and national consciousness, upon thinking of it, would not but gnash their teeth in hatred and vow not to coexist with the Red bandits in China. In May of this year, the National Assembly confirmed that the greatest disaster in China at present is the Red bandits, and unanimously resolved that suppressing the Red bandits is the most urgent task for the National Government and the people of the whole country. The government mobilized a large army, besieging and suppressing from all sides. Our frontline soldiers enduring the sweltering heat, traversing rugged terrain, bandaging wounds, and sacrificing their bodies to devote themselves to the work of suppressing bandits, is already obvious to everyone. Our Chairman of the National Government, Chiang Kai-shek, further entered Jiangxi to supervise the battle, vowing with life and death. In the past month, he has repeatedly captured important passes, and Ningdu and Donggu, the Red bandits' lairs, have also been successively captured. Thus, annihilating the mob and cutting off their roots is as easy as turning one's hand. At this point, our people nationwide should each do their duty, consistently assisting the government to complete the entire task of suppressing bandits. Unexpectedly, at this critical moment, Japanese imperialists, deliberately seeking trouble, instigated Koreans to massacre overseas Chinese, causing hundreds and thousands of casualties, and destroying countless properties, taking advantage of our government's focus on suppressing bandits, leaving it no time to attend to other matters, leading to a huge diplomatic dispute, in order to hold us hostage. The Wanbaoshan Incident, at most, was just a dispute caused by Korean farmers seizing land, which could be resolved by the Jilin Provincial Government and the Changchun County Government. However, Japanese ronin exaggerated the matter, spreading rumors and inciting trouble, determined to create an unprecedented tragedy for our Korean compatriots. And their frustrated warlords and politicians are even attacking the weakness and incompetence of their country's diplomacy, in order to force their government to become a second Tanaka Cabinet, sending troops to our country to obstruct the progress of bandit suppression. Our country, at this time, faces both internal strife and external aggression, pressing down on us simultaneously. How should the nation's soldiers follow the teachings of the Premier, obey the will of the people, and follow Commander-in-Chief Chiang, to engage in arduous and resolute struggle? Yet, Shi Yousan, with the wolfish ambition of a villain, stubbornly clinging to evil, levies funds and forcibly recruits soldiers, treating his defense area as private property, and viewing his subordinates as domestic slaves. As a member of the military, he disregards national laws, daring to raise troops in defiance of orders, plotting to disturb the peace of Tianjin and Beijing, endangering the party and the country, and willingly becoming a scapegoat for the enemy. Our central government, in the past, considering the people's hardship, has been lenient, comforting and tolerating, again and again. How could we have known that tolerating evil would only fuel the flames, and those who suffer would still be our people? In addition, the rebellious elements of Guangdong and Guangxi are watching Jiangxi and Hunan, supporting the Red bandits, acting as a screen. They have also secretly sent representatives such as Chen Youren to beg for pity from our eastern neighbor, currying favor with foreigners and selling out the country, which is known to all. Alas, how can our compatriots not be filled with anger? Reading Chairman Chiang's telegram from Nanchang on the 25th of this month, the rebellious elements in Guangdong are using 500,000 yuan to buy off Shi Yousan's troops, inciting rebellion, and secretly plotting to supply the Red bandits with guns and ammunition to prolong their existence. This further proves that the rebels inciting unrest, the warlords rebelling, the Red bandits rampaging, and the atrocities of Japanese imperialists, are all responding to each other, mutually causing each other. Without first pacifying the domestic situation, there is no way to resist foreign aggression. Alas, what has the party and the country done to wrong the rebels, that they must collude with warlords to create chaos, in order to prolong the life and ferocity of the Red bandits? If the people tolerate the warlords, then the warlords will surely further disrupt the unification and peace of the country. Therefore, the Red bandits must be suppressed, and the remnants of the warlords who created the opportunity for the Red bandits must especially be punished. Japan must be resisted, and the traitors and villains who collude with Japanese aggression must especially be annihilated. This is because these mad and unconscionable rebellious warlords, who cut themselves off from the people and alienate themselves from China, are no different from the Red bandits, no different from aliens. Our three million people of Shanghai, supporting the revolution, have been doing so for years. At this time of internal and external troubles, pressing down on us simultaneously, at this critical moment of life and death, after painful reflection, we know nothing else, but only know that the rebels who obstruct the suppression of bandits, the traitors who collude with age-old enemies, are all public enemies of our people and criminals of the country. We vow to support the central government, cleanse and sweep them away, and contribute money and efforts without hesitation. However, there is something that we especially cannot help but say. At this time of the new nation's founding, with hundreds of holes and thousands of wounds, to steady the situation and support what is in danger, we rely on leaders with a sense of responsibility. Our Chairman Chiang adheres to the teachings of the Premier, dedicates himself to the revolution, and takes suppressing bandits and punishing rebels as his own responsibility. He rushes to supervise the battle, being the vanguard of the people. Anyone with blood and qi cannot but be inspired. Furthermore, our generals, the pillars of the country, should especially clearly distinguish right from wrong, and differentiate obedience from disobedience. If they encourage their soldiers to eliminate traitors for the country, arrest Shi Yousan, and administer justice according to the law, so that there are no worries behind when suppressing bandits, and no concerns about traitors when dealing with foreign aggression, then they will have contributed to the country and will surely receive great rewards. If they willingly join the rebellion, refusing to turn back from the wrong path, then the will of the people and the law of the country will not tolerate them. Punishing and eradicating them will be the same as dealing with bandits, so that the seeds of rebellion will no longer remain, and unification and peace can be realized. As for our people nationwide, regarding the tragically deceased overseas Chinese, we should rescue the dying and heal the wounded, and avenge them. We especially wish to uphold the spirit of perseverance, make meticulous plans, and take deliberate actions, abiding by the rules of discipline, resolutely implementing economic severance with Japan, without the slightest compromise, in order to promote the awakening of the Japanese people and automatically stop the schemes of the stubborn warlords of that country. If there are those who are inherently disposed to currying favor with foreigners and are willing to sabotage, we must also uphold justice and abandon them with everyone. As long as we have a breath, this determination will not change. We humbly offer our sincerity and respectfully request your public consideration. Shanghai Municipal Citizens' Assembly for Suppressing Bandits, Punishing Rebels, Opposing Japan, and Aiding Overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>Declaration of the Assembly, July 30, Year 20.</p>
<h3>Implementation of the Factory Law Starts Tomorrow</h3>
<p>▲ Yan Zhuang Discusses Key Issues</p>
<p>The effective date of the Factory Law was originally scheduled to be the beginning of February this year.</p>
<p>Subsequently, after requests for postponement from various parties, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, considering the circumstances of industry and commerce, issued a notice postponing implementation for six months. Now, it has been determined that the effective date is from tomorrow (August 1st). Yesterday, Yan Zhuang, the Director of the Labor Department of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, came to Shanghai. This reporter inquired about the various circumstances regarding the implementation of the Factory Law. A summary of his conversation is recorded below: (1) Article 13 of the Factory Law, the issue of night work for female workers. The law clearly stipulates that female workers are not allowed to work from 10 PM to 6 AM the next morning. The intention of the law is to maintain morals and pay attention to the education of workers' children. The intention is good, but in reality, taking Shanghai as an example, there are at least 160,000 female workers in textile factories. If Article 13 of the law is implemented, at least 70,000 to 80,000 female workers will lose their jobs. What ability does the municipal government have to help them? And the immediate reduction in production is also an undeniable fact. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce has always taken promoting production and advocating worker welfare as its responsibilities in labor issues. Therefore, while maintaining the authority of the law, it also takes into account the dilapidated state of our country's industrial sector. Two weeks ago, it requested the Executive Yuan to find ways to provide relief. After discussion by the State Council, it was decided that "within two to three years, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce will urge factories to prepare for implementation." It was also submitted to the Central Political Conference for a decision. Yesterday, the Central Political Conference decided to postpone the implementation of that article for two years, with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce responsible for supervision. (2) Factory Law, one day off every seven days with pay. According to the regulations of the National Government, there are a total of eight legal holidays per year, all of which must be paid. If the Factory Law is followed, factories will have to pay for an additional 52 days of wages. In total, there will be two months of rest each year, which will have a significant impact on the production of our country's nascent industries. The significant losses to factories are secondary. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce, based on requests from various provinces and cities, and considering the circumstances, requested the Executive Yuan to find ways to remedy the situation. The State Council had already decided to submit it to the Judicial Yuan for interpretation. The 115th Standing Committee of the Central Government had already decided that the issue of paid holidays for workers should be handled in accordance with collective agreements and employment contracts. Therefore, the Judicial Yuan is requested to clarify whether the Central Government's decision during the period of political tutelage will remain effective after the implementation of the Factory Law. If the Judicial Yuan can understand the current actual situation of our country's immature industry, it will surely be able to find ways to remedy the situation later. (3) Factory conference, the qualification of factory representatives. In the factory conference, the factory and labor sides originally each had an equal number of representatives, from five to nine. However, according to the interpretation of the former Ministry of Industry and Commerce, only managers, deputy managers, factory directors, and deputy factory directors are qualified to represent the employer. If the factory follows the law, it will not be able to put forward five people as equal representatives for the factory conference. However, according to the interpretation of Article 6 of the Implementation Law of the Trade Union Law by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, in a factory, in addition to managers, deputy managers, factory directors, and deputy factory directors, department heads, foremen, and even gatekeepers can represent the employer and exercise management rights. This is because the law clearly stipulates that "except for the factories listed in Article 3 of the Factory Law, all staff, employees, and workers may join trade unions, but those who represent the employer and exercise management rights are not included." The phrase "those who exercise management rights" naturally refers to the staff, employees, and workers in the previous sentence who are qualified to represent the employer. Therefore, those who cannot join trade unions can represent the employer and join the factory conference. This matter has also been discussed and decided by the Executive Yuan, and submitted to the Judicial Yuan for interpretation. It is expected that the Judicial Yuan will be able to provide satisfactory interpretations for the above two points within the next few days, so that our country's nascent industry will not be affected, and workers will not suffer job losses, while being able to obtain considerable protection and welfare.</p>
<h3>Taking Over the French Courthouse Tomorrow Morning</h3>

<h3>Current Status of Yangtze River Shipping</h3>
<p>▲ Treacherous Merchants Smuggle Japanese Goods</p>
<p>▲ Changsha Gang Exclusively Loads Chinese Ships</p>
<p>▲ Treacherous Merchants Privately Transport Japanese Goods: Since various shipping companies implemented the ban on loading Japanese goods on the 24th, there is still a lot of Japanese fabric stored in this port, which cannot be transported to various ports along the Yangtze River. Recently, a certain merchant specializing in Japanese goods in Shanghai had a creative idea: entrusting the entire batch of Japanese cloth to a Japanese customs broker for declaration and loading on Japanese ships for export. Upon arrival at the destination, the goods are also picked up in the name of a Japanese merchant and then privately handed over to the treacherous merchant. In this way, the eyes and ears of the inspectors can be avoided. A certain amount of handling fee is given for each piece, and the Japanese are naturally happy to do so. Also, in view of the seizure of the cargo of the Lu Yang Gong in the barge the day before yesterday, from yesterday onwards, treacherous merchants transporting Japanese goods using barges have been inserting Japanese flags on the barges to indicate that they should not be inspected. As a result, the export volume of Japanese fabrics to the Yangtze River and the Northern and Southern Oceans is still quite high.</p>
<p>▲ Crowded Passengers and Goods in Changsha: Recently, Chinese merchant ships going upstream to Hankou have been very crowded with passengers and goods bound for Changsha from this port. There are two reasons for this: (1) Since the boycott, various passenger gangs in Hunan Province have refused to load on Japanese ships; (2) Last year, when the party was in Changsha, the godown of Jardine Matheson, a British company, was burned, and the passengers and goods were destroyed, amounting to nearly one million yuan. The passenger gangs demanded compensation from Jardine Matheson, but it was not approved. Therefore, various passenger gangs in Hunan Province have unanimously refused to transport on the company's merchant ships and are now exclusively loading on Chinese ships. Therefore, the Hunan-bound goods of China Merchants and Sanbei are very crowded.</p>
<p>▲ Goods No Longer Stored in Warehouses: This newspaper has reported twice that the floods in Hankou have submerged various warehouses. Although the water level is gradually receding, the water has not yet completely receded from the flooded warehouses, and various shipping companies are trying to move to higher ground. However, for the past few days, the various Jianglun ships of the Central American merchant have been unable to load large quantities of goods such as cane sugar and flour arriving in Hankou, because these goods would melt if they entered the water. Yesterday, various wheel bureaus discussed and decided that for the bureaus whose warehouses are submerged, when the ships arrive in Hankou, the goods will no longer be stored in the warehouses, and passengers will be notified to use barges for unloading, with the cost borne by the passengers. The original situation will be restored when the water recedes.</p>
<p>▲ Goods to Shanghai and Xun also Obstructed: Most of the goods from Shanghai to Jiujiang are transshipped to the interior and Nanchang, and vice versa. Yesterday, various ships in Shanghai received a telegram from Xun, saying that the Nanxun Road has been blocked by floods, and the transportation of goods in central Jiangxi has been obstructed. Furthermore, the warehouses cannot store goods, and the lighters have been fully loaded. Therefore, the import and export of passengers and goods have been obstructed.</p>
<h3>Jardine Matheson Sailors Temporarily Accept Wage Cuts</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that the issue of wage cuts between Jardine Matheson and its sailors has caused a tense situation for several weeks. The Chinese Coastal Western Sailors' Union held a meeting and decided that, in view of the current difficult business conditions, and for the sake of the overall situation, it would not force the company to accept the sailors' demands. The union sent a letter to the company yesterday, stating that it is willing to temporarily accept wages according to the current wage cut method. Therefore, the issue has been temporarily resolved.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry and Commerce Reiterates Penalties for Counterfeiting Trademarks</h3>
<p>▲ Those Intending to Counterfeit Will Be Sentenced to Two Years in Prison and Fined 3,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce received instructions from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce yesterday, It is hereby ordered to comply, It has been learned that those who intend to deceive others by counterfeiting registered or unregistered trademarks shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than two years and fined not more than 3,000 yuan, Article 268 of the Criminal Law has clearly stipulated, And counterfeiting the registered trademark of others can be regarded as counterfeiting, which has also been interpreted by the Legislative Yuan, Therefore, whether counterfeiting or imitating the registered trademark of others is strictly prohibited by law, However, it has been found that some unscrupulous merchants recently deliberately distort the provisions of the law, arguing that there are no special articles in the law for punishment, and dare to imitate the registered trademarks of others with the intention of making profits, This is a violation of the rights of others and should be reiterated so that they know that imitating the registered trademarks of others should be considered counterfeiting, If such imitation of the registered trademark of others occurs again in the future, the government will, for the sake of protecting the exclusive right to use the trademark, enforce the law and not lightly attempt to do so, lest they fall into the trap of the law, In addition to ordering, it is hereby ordered that the association inform the merchants, etc., to comply with the requirements, This order,</p>
<h3>Shanghai Fellow Association Telegraphs Sichuan Generals to Relieve Disaster in Sichuan Province</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Fellow Association in Sichuan, considering the severity of the disaster in Sichuan Province, urgently needs relief, and sent a telegram to the generals in Sichuan yesterday, Urgent, Chengdu Chairman Liu Zigan, Commander Deng Jinkang, Chongqing Supervisor Liu Fucheng, Guang'an Commander Yang Zihui, Shunqing Division Commander Li Qixiang, Suiding Supervisor Liu Jizhi, to all division and brigade commanders, I have repeatedly read reports from Sichuan and letters from citizens' groups in various counties, The price of rice has skyrocketed throughout Sichuan, and starvation is rampant everywhere, even to the point of digging for bark, roots, and soil, which are not enough, and humans and dogs are eating each other, presenting a tragic scene unseen in the past fifty or sixty years, The reason for this is that the price of rice has risen to ten thousand dollars and five or six out of ten people are starving, which is due to natural disasters and wars, The most serious thing is the collusion between the garrison troops in various places and the treacherous merchants, who manipulate the grain supply from the middle, which has led to this unprecedented rice famine, Although the military leaders have issued urgent announcements prohibiting hoarding, most of them are just formalities and do not help the actual situation, If the military leaders do not take effective measures to salvage the situation, I am afraid that the great famine in the future will be even more unimaginable, Although the members of this association are far away in other places, who does not have flesh and blood, and cannot bear to see them waiting for death, Therefore, with the most sincere request, I hope that you will leave a few traces of vitality for Sichuan, which is known as the land of abundance, On the active side, please eliminate the civil war, reduce taxes, and strive to provide relief, so that the common people can breathe a sigh of relief, On the passive side, please strictly order the military and political personnel under your command not to collude with or shield treacherous merchants, manipulate the people's food, and severely punish those who violate the law, as a warning to others, If you agree, the merit of saving the world will be greater than reciting ten thousand Amitabha, and the spirit of revolution can also be used to make some contributions, A special telegram is sent to inform you, I hope you will carefully examine, The Shanghai Fellow Association in Sichuan bows, Thirty seals,</p>
<h3>Excerpts from the Jìshēng Society's Relief Efforts in Gansu</h3>
<p>The Chinese Jìshēng Society recently received a telegram from Mr. Zhu Qinglan from Pingliang, Gansu, stating that he and his relief colleagues arrived in Pingliang, Gansu, to inspect the disaster situation. In Guyuan and Zhenyuan in eastern Gansu, there was no harvest in spring and summer, coupled with bandit disasters, rat plagues, and hailstorms, the situation is dire.

Mournful cries are heard everywhere, and the disaster-stricken people are crying out for food. It is truly overwhelming to provide relief, and it is impossible to cope.</p>
<h3>Various Trade Associations Oppose Jiangsu Province's Request for Assistance with Business Tax</h3>
<p>▲ Telegraphed the Executive Yuan to Order a Cease</p>
<p>(Guómín News Agency) Yesterday, over a hundred trade associations, including the silk and satin industry, mercerized cotton weaving industry, and dried goods industry in this city, telegraphed the Executive Yuan to order a halt to the Jiangsu Provincial Government's request for assistance with business tax funds from this city. The telegram reads: "Respectfully to the esteemed Executive Yuan of the Nanjing National Government, we have learned that the business tax is intended to offset the losses from the abolition of líjīn (internal tariffs) at the local level. This city has never had líjīn revenue and originally did not need to consider this. However, in order to assist in the city's administration and to implement the Premier's Grand Shanghai Plan, even in a time of commercial decline, the citizens are willing to contribute to fulfill their civic duties. Unexpectedly, the Jiangsu Provincial Government has made a move to request assistance with business tax funds from the authorities of this city, which violates the original intention of the citizens' tax payment. Moreover, the business tax is a local tax and should be used for local undertakings. If it is used for businesses outside the locality, it also goes against the original intention of the tax system. Therefore, we dare to appeal to your esteemed Yuan to order a halt to this. Otherwise, it is not what the citizens of this city would willingly accept. We are telegraphing in trepidation and await your orders."</p>
<h3>The Domestic Goods Market Will Seek a New Location</h3>
<p>▲ Yesterday, a Special Representative Meeting Was Held and Resolved</p>
<p>The Domestic Goods Market has been forced to close for nearly two months. The Shanghai Municipal Government has ordered the Municipal General Chamber of Commerce to investigate and report all losses suffered by various manufacturers and the market as a whole, in order to negotiate with the Municipal Council (of the Shanghai International Settlement). Yesterday, all the manufacturers held a special representative meeting for this matter. More than sixty people attended, including Liu Zhongying, Zhou Zhaolin, Hu Shengyao, Tang Rongqin, etc. Liu Zhongying was elected as chairman. The resolutions were: (1) To submit a petition to the Municipal Government, detailing the manufacturers' plight and requesting that negotiations with the Municipal Council be expedited. (2) To send a letter to the Municipal General Chamber of Commerce, requesting that personnel be dispatched as soon as possible to investigate the extent of the losses. (3) At this critical time of intense boycott of Japanese goods, domestic goods manufacturers should rise up together to fulfill the original purpose of saving the country through domestic goods. Now that the market has been sealed for no reason, the question of how to find another way out was discussed. It was resolved that, in addition to petitioning the Municipal Government to expedite negotiations with the Municipal Council, a suitable location should be sought to open a market, so as to fulfill the principle of exchanging goods for goods. (4) To send a letter to the Citizens' Society for the Promotion of Domestic Goods, requesting the initiation of a mobile exhibition of domestic goods, so that compatriots in various regions have the opportunity to recognize domestic goods. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>

<h3>Delayed Issuance of Bonuses and Back Pay at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company</h3>
<p>The bonuses previously issued by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the back pay from August of last year were initially planned to be paid in cash on June 4th. However, due to the lack of such a large sum of money, and Commissioner Guo's telegram to the Central Government, the bonus system was cancelled, and rewards would be given after the company's business developed. The already issued bonuses would be paid. Originally scheduled to be paid at the end of July along with the back pay, the checks for this item have been temporarily postponed due to a lack of funds.</p>
<h3>Request to Form a Maritime Court to Adjudicate the "Dà Chāng" Ship Sinking Case</h3>
<p>After the Dà Huá Company's Dà Chāng ship was sunk by the Pingan Company's Dà Huá ship, an agreement was made for public arbitration. After lengthy negotiations, it has not yet been realized. Now, the Dà Huá Company has decided to request the Ministry of the Navy to form a maritime court to publicly adjudicate the case, to clarify responsibility and expedite the decision. The following is what has been heard:</p>
<p>Dispute Over Arbitration Contract Dà Huá and Pingan each sent personnel to the Navigation Association to sign an arbitration contract for this case. Dà Huá argued that the arbitrators should be one appointed by each side, and another jointly appointed by the two arbitrators. This would allow for mutual arbitration, and if they disagree, the final judgment could be made solely by the third party, which would be fairer. However, Pingan did not agree very much, arguing that only one person should be used. Dà Huá rejected this, saying that having one person arbitrate would lead to many abuses and there would be no remedy.</p>
<p>▲ Unable to Agree on a Settlement Dà Huá put forward the reasons why three arbitrators would be the most appropriate, but could not obtain Pingan's approval. Yu Qiaqing of the Shanghai Navigation Association believed that because both sides were holding their ground, the case was being prolonged. Now that Dà Huá was suffering a significant loss alone, it was indeed something Pingan would be happy to see, which was not fair. Therefore, he proposed mediation to both sides, changing to a subsidized settlement, which would resolve the matter quickly. However, this method was not desired by the China United Assurance Corporation and Dà Huá, and thus could not proceed.</p>
<p>▲ Petitioned the Ministry of the Navy for Public Adjudication Dà Huá Company believes that the sinking of the Dà Chāng resulted in losses of hundreds of thousands of yuan. This matter has not yet been compensated by Pingan, and arbitration is unable to proceed. Now, the company has decided to submit the case to the Ministry of the Navy, requesting the Ministry to form a maritime court to hear the case and determine responsibility, so that the victims can receive compensation. Yesterday, Mr. Qin of the company told reporters that the petition was being prepared.</p>
<p>▲ Unpaid Customs Fees The Jianghai Customs spent 77,000 taels to blow up the Dà Chāng, which must be acknowledged by the shipowner. Currently, the Shanghai shipping community is working hard to request an amendment to the maritime law, stating that the cost of salvaging sunken ships by customs should not be borne by the shipowner. Yesterday, the Ministry of Communications issued an order stating that it had asked the Executive Yuan to consult with the Legislative Yuan to amend this article. Therefore, Dà Huá has not yet paid the blasting fee. In recent days, the iron plates of the blasted Dà Chāng ship have been salvaged and auctioned off by customs workers.</p>

<h3>"The Secrets of the Arctic" Premieres in Paris Today</h3>

<h3>Representatives' Meeting of the National Goods Factory Alliance</h3>

<h3>The Sales of Sheng Dan are Booming</h3>
<p>The Sheng Dan, a domestic product produced by the Jiu Fu Company, has an established reputation as an essential health product for the summer. This time, the Xie Xing Pharmaceutical Factory, in the midst of the anti-Japanese and overseas Chinese support movement, spared no expense in promoting it on a large scale, and prepared many samples for free distribution, hoping that those who have always blindly believed in imported Dan can take this opportunity to recognize the fragrance and efficacy of domestic Sheng Dan, and unanimously promote it. In the early stages, advertisements for guessing games were published in various newspapers and periodicals to test the extent to which people from all walks of life knew about this Sheng Dan. As a result, more than 48,000 letters were received, of which less than 2,000 were mistakenly guessed as Ballantine's or other products. This shows that all sectors have a unified understanding of the domestic Sheng Dan, and that its low price, color, fragrance, and superiority to imported Dan are especially in the minds of all sectors. This can be said to be a great success in terms of domestic goods. It is now heard that the Xie Xing Pharmaceutical Factory expresses its deep gratitude for this, and all those who guessed correctly will be given a small package of Sheng Dan, and those who did not guess correctly will also be given a sample, as a small token of appreciation. They are now being sent out by hand, and the sales of Sheng Dan are also in a state of being unable to meet the demand, and work is being stepped up.</p>

<h3>Shuài Sòngpíng's Sentencing Date</h3>
<p>▲ August 4th</p>
<p>Shuài Sòngpíng, a Jiangxi native who has held prominent official positions in the past, engaged in kidnapping after leaving the political arena. The kidnapping of Lu Shaotang, the compradore of the Fair Price Foreign Firm, last year was instigated by Shuài. He was apprehended by Chief Inspector Lu Liankui of the General Inspectorate and handed over to the Special District Court. The various circumstances of the interrogation have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Xu Jiashi, the presiding judge of the criminal division of the Special Court, held another hearing in the first criminal court. He first briefly questioned Shuài Sòngpíng. Shuài completely denied the kidnapping of Lu and hired lawyer E Sen to defend him. The court then ordered the debate to begin. The police lawyer Ru Baoyi stated that after solving the case, the police found that the gang's headquarters was in the Great East Hotel, and the place where the hostage was held was in a house owned by Cheng Zhongshi on Hart Road. When Shuài was arrested, the waiter at the Great East Hotel identified the defendant as going to the gang's headquarters, and Cheng Zhongshi's accountant also identified the defendant as the person who came to rent the house, who at the time claimed to be named Wang Zhishan. Moreover, the criminal who had already been sentenced provided evidence. The defendant claimed that he was not in Shanghai at the time of the incident, but the letters found by the police at his home were all sent to the defendant at the time of the incident. Therefore, the evidence in this case is unusually sufficient, and he should be severely punished according to the law. However, lawyer E Sen argued that the waiter at the Great East Hotel and the criminals who rented the house on Hart Road all said that the Shuài Sòngpíng they had seen before was fatter than the defendant. According to the precedents of the Supreme Court, vague confessions cannot be considered positive evidence. The police submitted letters proving that the defendant was in Shanghai, which was incorrect, because Shuài's departure from Shanghai was not announced to friends and relatives beforehand, so friends and relatives only knew that he was in Shanghai, so the letters were sent to him, not knowing that he had already left Shanghai. This point is also insufficient to prove guilt, and he should be declared innocent. Judge Xu then announced that the debate was over and scheduled the sentencing for the morning of August 4th.</p>
<h3>Two Kidnappers Executed by Firing Squad</h3>
<p>▲ Four Kidnapping Cases</p>
<p>▲ One Major Robbery Case</p>
<p>The Chinese and Western detectives of the Hongkou Police Station previously arrested Shi Jinde, a 23-year-old native of Suzhou, and Li Wenbing, a 21-year-old local (native of Tongzhou), on suspicion of kidnapping. Investigations revealed that on November 4, 1929, they kidnapped Lou Kenzai, a student at the Qianye Public School on Peng Road. On December 6 of the same year, they kidnapped Xi Lusheng, the compradore of HSBC, in front of the Yizhi Xiang restaurant on Fuzhou Road, and shot him dead on the spot. On February 19, 1930, they kidnapped Zhang Zukang, the Soy Sauce King, on Wuchang Road. On April 14, they kidnapped Zhang Xinglian and Zhang Hualian, sons of Zhang Shouchong, the Director of the Department of Finance, on Daxi Road, extorting huge sums of money. They were also major criminals in the robbery of 46,000 yuan from the Four Banks Reserve Treasury on the Bund of Fuzhou Road on March 13. They were handed over to the Special District Court for interrogation and were sentenced to death in various places. After being approved by the superiors, the execution date arrived yesterday morning. At 8:30 AM, the police escorted the two criminals, Shi and Li, to the Third Criminal Court of the Special Court, where Judge Cheng Shangfeng presided. He asked the two criminals if they had any last words and to write letters to their families. Shi Jinde confessed, "Please notify Mrs. Xue at No. 21 Taichang Li, Dong Youheng Road, to come and collect the body. I have nothing else to say." Li Wenbing confessed, "Please consult the slaughterhouse on the opposite side of the Changjiang Road in the French Concession, next to Tongkang Li, which is my home. Today is the execution date, so there is no need for anyone to collect the body. However, my family is very poor, and I have not received a penny of the kidnapped money." The attitudes of the two criminals, Shi and Li, were strong and fearless, and they were rude to the detectives in charge of the case. Judge Cheng stopped them in court and ordered the Chinese and Western police to take Shi and Li down, put them in a car along with the files and photos, and drive to the Caohejing Second Prison execution ground. Yang, a prosecutor from the Local Court, was appointed as the supervising officer. He ordered Police Chief Xu Jinqing, Police Inspector Chen Xihui, and execution police officers Wang Jianqing, Xu Guoguang, Yin Daoxu, Zhang Chunsen, etc., to rush to the Caohejing Second Prison execution ground. After the judge and Warden Dong took their seats, they examined the prisoners one by one. The judge then ordered the execution, and Chief Xu directed the execution police to take them down and execute them by firing squad. The bodies were collected and sealed by the hall.</p>
<h3>Gang Fight Among Workers from Hubei at Hongsheng Wharf</h3>
<p>▲ Xiexing Gong and Anlu Inn</p>
<p>▲ Dispute Arising from Competition for Business</p>
<p>▲ Anlu Inn Suffers Defeat</p>
<p>Several hundred workers from Hubei Province engaged in a gang fight at Hongsheng Wharf in Pudong's Lannidu the night before last, due to a dispute over the proper order of unloading cargo from ships. As a result, many sustained knife wounds of varying severity. The details of the investigation are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲ Both Groups of Workers Have Their Reasons: The incident originated on the 24th of this month, when workers from the Hubei gang, including Li Gaoyu, Liu Hanxiang, Zhong Daokai, and others, jointly submitted a petition to the Third District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. It stated that they were representatives of the Xiexing Gong 131 Workers' Group, engaged in the business of transporting goods to and from the Taikoo Company and Hongsheng Wharf for many years. Recently, Jiang Yushan and Gao Hanqing, representatives of Taikoo Anlu Inn, had incited laborers to seize their business, and they requested police protection. While the police were investigating, Jiang Yushan and others from Anlu Inn also submitted a petition to the Third District, requesting registration. Their petition stated that there were hundreds of fellow villagers residing under their jurisdiction who relied on working at the wharves for their livelihood. Due to the large number of people, disputes often arose. After discussions among the villagers, it was decided that all customs-declared goods going to and from the Taikoo Company and Hongsheng Wharf would be handled by Xiexing Gong workers. The scattered miscellaneous goods outside the ship that did not need to enter the warehouse would be transported by Anlu Inn workers. This arrangement had been in place for over ten years without any problems. Now, Li Gaoyu and others from Xiexing Gong were relying on their large numbers to forcibly occupy all the miscellaneous goods that did not need to enter the warehouse, which was bound to cause trouble.</p>
<p>▲ Dispute Arises, Mediation Fails: District Chief Zhang, seeing that both sides had their own arguments, feared that these people would riot. He sent several experienced police officers to the wharf every day to suppress any disturbances. The day before yesterday afternoon, when a Wanjia steamer arrived at Hongsheng Wharf, the Xiexing Gong workers continued to unload the customs-declared goods as usual. However, both sides held onto the miscellaneous goods outside the ship, refusing to yield, and each gathered many people to wait at the wharf. District Chief Zhang of the Third District, believing that these people were about to resort to violence, dispatched a platoon of armed police officers to the scene. At the same time, he summoned the representatives of both sides, Li Gaoyu and Jiang Dashan, for questioning, instructing them to continue their respective businesses according to the old customs. However, Li Gaoyu and others from Xiexing Gong firmly refused. Then, Chief Chang Caichen was called in to mediate, urging both sides to compromise. While Anlu Inn had already expressed their willingness to compromise, Xiexing Gong still insisted on their previous demands, causing Chang to resign from his mediation duties without any result. It was already six o'clock in the evening.</p>
<p>▲ Gang Fight Results in Injuries: District Chief Zhang, seeing that the ship had been delayed for too long and was obstructing traffic, instructed the representatives of both sides to send half of their workers to unload the cargo, with each side receiving half of the wages. He told them to return to the district the next morning (i.e., yesterday) at eight o'clock to await mediation. If mediation failed, they would be transferred to the court for investigation. However, not long after the representatives left, the workers on both sides suddenly clashed. The scene became chaotic, with shouts and police whistles filling the air. The number of police officers at the scene was insufficient to stop the fight. As a result of the gang fight, Anlu Inn was outnumbered and two people were stabbed: (1) Jiang Hanrong, three knife wounds to the arm; (2) Gao Chunlin, three knife wounds to the leg. On the Xiexing Gong side, Zhang Yuming and Zhong Daokai were injured, but not seriously. Subsequently, the water patrol team arrested Li Gaoyu, Xiang Yuren, and Wang Wenan, three people involved in the incident.</p>
<p>▲ Xiexing Gong Representative Handed Over to the General Bureau: After Jiang Hanrong and others were injured, they were bleeding profusely and unable to move. Fellow workers carried them to the Third District, where the district chief immediately sent all the police officers to arrest the culprits. However, they had already scattered and fled. The injured were then transferred to the nearby Pudong Hospital for treatment. That evening, the doctors examined them one by one and bandaged their wounds. Yesterday morning at eight o'clock, they were brought back and handed over to the local court for investigation. The Xiexing Gong representative, Li Gaoyu, was transferred by the water patrol team to the Public Security General Bureau for disposition.</p>
<h3>Zou Aizhen Withdraws Lawsuit Against Dr. Tang</h3>
<p>▲ Tang Already Involved in Litigation at the Special Court</p>
<p>▲ Zou Disregards Transfer for Trial</p>
<p>Zou Aizhen, the wife of economic doctor Tang Chongci (i.e., Tang Huixuan), filed a lawsuit in the local court, accusing him of abandonment and seeking a divorce. The court had summoned Tang Chongci, but he did not appear, and the court ordered a further summons, as reported in previous news. Yesterday, the continued hearing was held again. At ten o'clock in the morning, Zou Aizhen, accompanied by lawyer Yang Zhihao, arrived at the court to await the hearing. Soon after, Judge Tong Shenglü specially opened the Eighth Tribunal. The defendant, Tang Chongci, did not appear. The official summoned Zou Aizhen to the case and said, "According to the bailiff's report, Tang Chongci currently resides in the Public Concession, 48 Baoshan Lane, Baoding Road. However, personnel cases are subject to special trial. According to the Civil Procedure Law, this court will transfer the case to the Special Court for trial." Lawyer Yang replied, "After the plaintiff applied to your court for mediation on May 8, the defendant initiated litigation in the Special Court, which is clearly an evasion. I request public service." The official said, "If the defendant's address is unknown, public service may be allowed. However, since the defendant has a definite address, the procedure is improper, and the request cannot be granted." Zou Aizhen then stated, "I request the presiding judge to transfer jurisdiction to the Special District Court for your court to try. Moreover, the defendant suddenly filed a lawsuit in the Special Court, intending to deceive the authorities, which is quite obvious. I speculate that the Special Court may not be clear about everything that happened between us." The official said, "You have been involved in litigation for a long time, and the newspapers have reported in detail. It is expected that the Special Court will have a clear understanding early on. If you do not want to transfer the case to the Special Court, you might as well withdraw the lawsuit." Lawyer Yang replied, "I request to withdraw." The official ordered her to sign and leave the court.</p>
<h3>Judgment in the Case of an Indian Guard Committing Assault</h3>
<p>▲ Warning to All Gatekeepers and Police</p>
<p>▲ Use of Force Must Be More Careful</p>
<p>The "Great American Evening News" reported that this morning (30th), British police magistrate Haines, when hearing the case of Indian man Meng Shaxin assaulting a rickshaw puller, warned all gatekeepers and Indian police officers not to abuse force when performing their duties. Meng Shaxin was the night shift Indian guard at He Dong's residence at 157 Seymour Road. Yesterday (29th) afternoon, he used a staff to violently beat rickshaw puller Qi Hexin, causing serious injuries and breaking Qi's left pinky finger. This morning, he was brought to the British police court for interrogation. The rickshaw puller testified that he was beaten for parking his rickshaw in front of He Dong's residence to eat. Mrs. Kerkes, a Western woman who witnessed the incident, and Mr. Hulf, the Western rickshaw owner, also testified in court. The magistrate sentenced Meng Shaxin to 21 days of imprisonment with hard labor, and declared that there had been frequent incidents of Indians assaulting Chinese people this month. This kind of abuse of force must be stopped immediately. Therefore, all gatekeepers and Indian police officers are warned to be more careful when using force.</p>
<h3>Another Person Involved in the Case of a Westerner Purchasing Arms</h3>
<p>▲ Zhenjiang Native Wei Xiaolan</p>
<p>Russian Bi Ke Leweisigai, for impersonating a National Government military officer to order a huge amount of arms from Lai Fa Foreign Firm using counterfeit documents, was detained by the patrol room to the Special District Court for interrogation. This has been reported in this newspaper before. It is now known that the chief detective Ma Wenda of the General Patrol Room and the Western detective Beibeining have found that Wei Xiaolan from Zhenjiang is also suspected of being involved in this case. They arrested Wei at 33 Mingde Lane, Pushi Road in the French Concession at 9:30 on the morning of the day before yesterday and brought him to the patrol room. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Criminal Division One of the Special District Court, where Judge Xu Jiashi presided over the interrogation. The patrol room's lawyer, Ru Bao Yi, stated that the patrol room requested to temporarily detain Wei Xiaolan because Wei also went to the plaintiff Lai Fa's office when Leweisigai went there, saying that he was the secretary of Zhang Faying, a representative of the National Government. However, the patrol room has not yet determined whether Wei will be a defendant or a witness. Lai Fa then testified that Wei Xiaolan had come to his office twice. The first time was on May 24th, when he came with Leweisigai. According to Leweisigai, Wei was Zhang Faying's secretary, but he did not speak English. Wei Xiaolan stated that he did not know Leweisigai, but was introduced by a Russian named Xue Ge Lai, who said that there was a transaction with a Chinese businessman and asked him to act as an interpreter. Xue was a colleague of the former Jinpu Railway. He then went to Leweisigai's residence at 24 Shengmuyuan Road. Leweisigai then took him to Lai Fa's office. What they discussed was all about arms. He did not want to object at the time, so he tolerated it. After he left, he negotiated with Leweisigai, and Leweisigai said, "Why are you so timid?" Later, Leweisigai came again, asking him to go to the plaintiff's office again. He refused and advised him not to do such a dangerous thing. Leweisigai then said to him, "You are so timid, so you cannot be called a military commander, but only a secretary." He insisted that he go with him, so he had no choice but to go. He heard Leweisigai say to Lai Fa, "You must find a Chinese person to be a guarantor." Lai Fa said to Leweisigai, "The draft contract can be given to you tomorrow." After he left, he asked Leweisigai what he meant. Leweisigai said that they wanted a Chinese person to be a guarantor, and after he signed the contract, they would entrust a lawyer to ask him for money. If he refused, they would report to the National Government and would achieve the purpose of defrauding money. After Bik Leweisigai was arrested, the newspapers all reported on the matter. Then, an old Russian named Xue Ge Lao came to ask him if he had stopped the matter because of this. He answered yes and then asked him who would go after he left. Xue claimed to be the person who packed opium for him. After the patrol room arrested him, they went to arrest the individual Xue mentioned, but he had disappeared. He graduated from St. Francis School and has served in the Wah Nan and Peace Foreign Firms, so he is familiar with most of the foreign firms. This time, he was really implicated. Judge Xu then ordered him to be detained and interrogated again at a later date.</p>
<h3>Robbery on Qiale Road</h3>
<p>The Wang family, who run a hardware business at 3 Changxing Lane, Qiale Road, Nanyang Bridge in the French Concession, were suddenly visited by three robbers at 9:30 yesterday morning. Two of the robbers were wearing silk long gowns, and one was wearing a short jacket, speaking with local accents. Each held a pistol and broke in through the front door. The house was a double-wing building, and the Wang family lived alone. The robbers shouted to silence them and drove the Wang family mistress and servants into a room. One robber guarded the door and began ransacking boxes and cabinets at will. After searching, they found the owner's bank checks and deposit books. The robbers ordered the Wang family owner to sign a check for 1,000 yuan payable immediately, to withdraw foreign currency. The remaining robbers waited in the room. From morning to about 1 pm, the robbers who went to withdraw the money did not return. The owner and his wife wanted to urinate, so they begged the robbers for convenience. The robbers allowed the Wang family mistress to go to another room to relieve herself. Unexpectedly, the Wang family was alert and closed the door, shouting for help. The robbers, seeing that the matter had been exposed, immediately fled with the loot. The Wang family's rickshaw puller was indeed a brave man and followed the robbers, shouting loudly to catch them. Finally, one robber was captured. The strangest thing was that when the robbers were being arrested, a white-牌 taxi drove up, apparently hired by the robbers for escape. The detectives detained them all at the Songshan Road patrol room. It is reported that there were a total of five robbers, three entering the house and two guarding outside. It was then learned by the patrol room that the robbers gathered and departed from room 414 of the Shenzhou Hotel. The remaining robbers are currently being searched for and the original stolen goods are being recovered.</p>
<h3>Change of Names of Various Ship Tax Offices</h3>
<p>▲ Notice from the Municipal Finance Bureau</p>
<p>The Municipal Finance Bureau issued a notice yesterday: "For the purpose of the notice, the names of the bureau's various ship tax offices have now been revised by the Municipal Government. Except for the Wusong Ship Tax Office, which retains its original name, the Dongjiadu Ship Tax Office will be renamed the Huna Ship Tax Office, the Suzhou River Ship Tax Office will be renamed the Zhabei Ship Tax Office, and the Chenjiadu Ship Tax Office will be renamed the Pusong Ship Tax Office, effective August 1st of this year. This notice is hereby issued to all shipowners in the city for their information."</p>
<h3>Gaochang District Sanitation Tax Awarded to Ma Hongji</h3>
<p>▲ Notice issued by the Municipal Finance Bureau Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau issued a notice yesterday: "For the purpose of the notice, the amount of the sanitation tax in Gaochang District has been determined by the bureau and approved by the Municipal Government. It has been allocated to Zhongxi Chenshang Ma Hongji for concurrent operation for a period of three years. In addition to instructing the merchant to take over the operation from August 1st of this year and requesting the Public Security Bureau to order its subordinates to protect it, this notice is hereby issued to all residents of the district for their information."</p>
<h3>Letter from Wine Merchants to the Director of the License Tax Bureau</h3>
<p>Hua Dong News reported that the Zhabei Yuanyuanheng and other wine merchants sent a letter to Gu Daosheng, the director of the Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Bureau, saying: "Director Gu Daosheng, Greetings. We hereby inform you that our company sent a representative to exchange licenses and pay taxes the day before yesterday. We learned that your bureau has changed the grades of the old licenses from the previous session and increased the taxes. For example, the old Yuanyu Company has always been a Class B license, which should pay 4 yuan. Now it has been changed to Class A, adding 4 yuan. Most of the households, such as Guangda, have always been Class C, and should pay 2 yuan each, but now they have been changed to Class B, adding 2 yuan. This kind of tax increase policy was not notified in advance and was suddenly increased when people were unprepared. According to the tax administrative procedures, the burden on merchants may be excessive. However, the Yuanyu and other companies belong to merchants, and although they feel the pain of this unilateral high pressure for this heavy tax that was levied without notice, they have no choice but to try their best to pay, since it is related to the country's economy. Unexpectedly, in addition to this sudden tax increase, two corners were added to the mother tax of one yuan. Since the collection fee is noted to be exempt, this additional 20% has not been noted on the license under which item, nor has it been announced to the taxpayers what it is for. Such tax collection is increased, and then collected again, with layers of squeezing, not only can the business power not support it, but also adds a kind of unfounded extra burden. As far as doubts are concerned, we are sending a letter for your reference, hoping that your bureau will understand and clearly show us what to follow."</p>
<h3>Recent News on Road Administration in the Public Concession</h3>
<p>▲ Expenses for Purchasing Land and Releasing Roads in the Central District</p>
<p>▲ Propose Temporarily Postponing Organization Within This Year</p>
<p>The Public Concession Bureau released the minutes of the Public Works Committee meeting on the 21st of this month. According to the report of the Accounting Office, the expenses for widening and expanding roads in the first half of this year have reached 1,095,902 taels, which is only 704,094 yuan according to the budget. At present, the Bureau's expenditures on investment are huge, and it is difficult to allocate more funds. It is proposed to temporarily postpone the implementation of road improvement projects that are not urgent. According to the director of the Engineering Department, most of these expenses are due to the purchase of land and the widening of roads when houses are rebuilt in the central district. Land prices in the central district are higher, and the cost is inevitably higher. However, if the opportunity to purchase land is taken, the realization of the Bureau's road improvement plan will be delayed for many years. After discussion by the committee members, it was proposed to temporarily postpone the implementation of projects that are not of major importance this year, but it is also necessary to consider the situation of citizens rebuilding houses and handle them appropriately.</p>
<h3>Continued News on the Reorganization of the Guangdong Businessmen's Hospital</h3>

<h3>Traffic to Mogan Mountain Has Resumed</h3>
<p>▲ China Travel Service Continues to Sell Joint Tickets</p>
<p>The China Travel Service in this city previously suspended the sale of joint transportation tickets from Shanghai to Mogan Mountain due to heavy rain in Hangzhou and floods in Wukang Mountain, which caused the traffic from Hangzhou to Mogan Mountain to be severely flooded and impassable for cars. It is now reported that the weather has cleared since the day before yesterday, the water has receded, and traffic has resumed. Cars can directly reach the foot of the mountain, so the company has resumed selling joint transportation tickets to the mountain as usual.</p>
<h3>Liang Saizhen Sues "Camera" Tabloid</h3>
<p>The "Camera" tabloid at 12 Pike Road published a section of "Unofficial History of the Silver Screen" in its June 20th issue, which included a passage about Liang Saizhen's abandoned child, stating that Liang had a relationship with Xu Qinfu, a colleague at the Star Film Company, and did not take care of the child she bore, causing him to be dirty and resembling a beggar. During mealtimes, she did not allow him to sit down, so the child secretly scooped up cat food to fill his hunger, resulting in cat fish scales sticking to his mouth, a pitiful sight that was difficult to describe. After reading the report, Liang Saizhen, believing that she had been able to gain audience favor for the films she starred in at the Star Film Company because of her reputation and artistry, filed a criminal self-suit against the editor and author of "Camera" with the Special District Court through lawyer Zhan Jifeng, requesting that they be punished in accordance with Article 325 of the Criminal Law for damaging her reputation and ruining her credibility. Yesterday morning, Judge Ge Zhitan of the Special Court opened a court session to summon them. The "Camera" tabloid was represented by editor Zhang Yuyan, accompanied by lawyer Da Yaoxian, to respond to the suit. Lawyer Zhan Jifeng stated that, according to his lawyer's investigation with the Education Bureau, the registered editor of the newspaper was not Zhang Yuyan, but Li Muzhi, so Zhang was actually a substitute, and Li should be summoned to the case. Zhang Yuyan stated that he had been the editor since the tenth issue, and Li had been the editor before the tenth issue. As for the point in the manuscript that the plaintiff had a relationship with Xu Qinfu, there were rumors of this outside, and this newspaper was to refute the rumors. Judge Ge stated that June 20th was the first issue of the "Camera" tabloid, so Li must be summoned to the case. He then ordered the case to be postponed to the 13th of this month for further hearing and summoned Li Muzhi and the "Camera" tabloid to the case for investigation.</p>

<h3>The Problem of Implementing the Factory Law in Our Country by Chen Da</h3>
<p>(1) General Remarks: (A) Origin of this study, the labor legislation of our country, its history is very short, regarding the factory part, in the eleventh year of the Republic of China, the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce promulgated the Provisional Regulations for Factories by ministerial order. In the winter of the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, the Legislative Yuan promulgated the Factory Law. We feel that there are several places where the latter surpasses the former, which also indicates the progress of our country's labor legislation. However, regarding the National Government's Factory Law, there have been many discussions from various parties recently. Some believe that the intention of the law is very good, the purpose is to protect workers and promote the development of industry, and it should be implemented as soon as possible. Others believe that the law is close to ideal, and some articles are too far from reality, and must be amended before it can be implemented. In fact, the degree of reliability of these opinions cannot be determined without factual research. In February of the twentieth year of the Republic of China, the People's Livelihood Improvement Research Association (sponsored by the Christian Progressive Association) held a meeting in Shanghai and had a heated discussion on our country's Factory Law. As a result, a resolution was passed advocating for factual research with a fair and impartial attitude, and the author was appointed to undertake this work. Due to the constraints of time, personnel, and economy, the author took Shanghai as the initial research area. Although, to understand the truth of the facts, it is necessary to have a national scope. However, Shanghai is a region with particularly developed industry and commerce, and it is the region with the most Chinese and foreign factories. Therefore, the research in Shanghai is of course more important than other cities. From the research in Shanghai, we can see the general situation of the implementation of the Factory Law. At the beginning of the research work, several institutions cooperated and sponsored it. On the Chinese side, there was the Industrial and Commercial Management Association, and on the foreign side, there was the Employers' Association. Other sponsors included government agencies (such as the Nanjing Bureau of Statistics, the Industrial and Commercial Visiting Bureau, the Academia Sinica, the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau, etc.), public institutions, and labor unions. We are very grateful. (B) Scope of this study, the author engaged in stipulating a kind of investigation form. On the Chinese side, five investigators were sent to two hundred factories to fill out the form. On the foreign side, in both English and Japanese, the Employers' Association sought answers by correspondence and implemented the investigation. It took about a month to complete. In addition, there were talks with various parties, such as government officials and more than sixty Chinese and foreign employers (most of the foreign employers were handled by Ms. E.M. Hinder), more than ten labor union leaders, and more than ten male, female, and child laborers. Therefore, this study is largely based on the analysis of facts. It includes 176 Chinese factories and 52 foreign factories, with a total of 51,960 male workers, 1,041 female workers, 11,895 child laborers, and 3,173 apprentices. The industry is divided into six major categories, as shown in the following table: "Type of Industry" "Number of Factories" (1) Textile Industry 128, (A) Cotton Spinning Industry 49, (B) Cotton Weaving Industry 13, (C) Silk Reeling Industry 29, (D) Silk Weaving Industry 18, (E) Knitting Industry 19, (2) Chemical Industry 34, (A) Bleaching and Dyeing Industry 13, (B) Soap, Glass, Matches, Cosmetics, etc. 21, (3) Food Industry 24, (A) Tobacco Industry 17, (B) Flour, Canned Food, Food, Soda, Seasoning, etc. 7, (4) Public Utilities (Electricity, Tram, Gas, Tap Water, Telephone, Public Buildings, Public Buses), (5) Machine Industry 24, (A) Steel Industry, (B) Appliances, Electrical Appliances, Utensils, Construction Industry, Shipbuilding Industry, (6) Paper Making and Printing Industry "1. Total 228. (C) Methods and purposes of this study, the investigation method used this time is usually called the sampling method. The sampling standards are as follows: (1) The selected factories must meet the definition of the Factory Law. (2) The selected industries must have considerable economic and social impact. (3) Among the three types of workers, male, female, and child, the selected factories must have at least two types. (4) The scope of the factory includes large, medium, and small categories. However, due to practical difficulties, the selected factories cannot fully meet the standards. This study took a total of two and a half months. Some materials were actually unavailable, and some materials were not collected due to the limitations of talent, economy, and time, so there are many regrets. The organization of the materials is also inevitably subject to errors. If readers can point them out, we would be extremely pleased. Although this survey is simple, it is the first attempt at a factual study of the Factory Law and also the first time for Chinese and foreign cooperation. We hope that others will be willing to conduct more detailed and extensive research on this issue in order to understand the truth about the implementation of the Factory Law throughout the country. The purpose of this survey is to study the degree of implementation of the Factory Law based on facts, that is, to find appropriate answers to the following questions: (1) What is the normal working time per day in Shanghai's industries? (2) Is it possible to abolish the night work of female and child laborers immediately? (3) What is the economic loss to industry when the Factory Law is implemented? In addition to economic loss, what are the important impacts? (4) Based on the current situation, what parts of the Factory Law can be implemented and what parts still need to wait for some time? (D) Conclusions and recommendations of this study, this study has partial answers to the above questions, and some have not been answered due to the lack of sufficient materials. Now, based on the collected data, we have organized and analyzed it and created a simple report for public discussion. For clarity, we take the Factory Law as the main body and present the important clauses in the following table. The table is divided into three parts: (1) What is the current situation regarding each article? (2) What does the Factory Law stipulate regarding this article? (3) What are the author's recommendations regarding this article? The simple conclusion is as follows:</p>

<p>The above table is the final conclusion of this study. From this, the following conclusions can be drawn: (1) The study is far from the facts and is difficult to implement. (2) But the author believes that the Factory Law is a necessary law for social improvement. We must work towards this direction. (3) Therefore, we should take the Factory Law as the goal, but before reaching this goal, we must find a way in. The author does not presume to believe that several suggestions are the way in, because these suggestions are based on facts and are moving towards the Factory Law. If these suggestions are the way in, then we can implement the Factory Law in stages. Some clauses can be implemented now, and some clauses can be implemented after one year, two years, or three years. Now, a brief description is as follows: Implementation procedures of the Factory Law: (A) Implemented immediately: (1) Factory Records: (A) The factory shall maintain records in accordance with the Factory Law, deleting the workers' character, skills, work efficiency, and causes of illness. (B) This record shall be available for factory inspectors to consult at any time. (C) The factory shall report to the government once at the end of each year, and the report shall contain a summary of the records. (D) Add a disaster report to the record. (2) Young workers: All men and women who are 12 years old, a certain height (standard determined after investigation), and whose bodies have passed the doctor's examination, shall be issued an employment certificate. This doctor shall be appointed by the government. (3) Rest days: Two days per month (without pay) (4) Working hours: 10 hours per day (or 20 hours per day and night) This article does not apply to the following: (A) Seasonal industries (but the silk industry is not an exception), (B) Industries whose machine work is continuous and cannot be stopped (listed), (C) Those who use only male workers, (D) In case of natural disasters or special events, (5) Subsidies and Pensions: (A) The articles on injury and death shall follow the original text, (B) Add subsidies for industrial diseases (industrial diseases must be defined), (C) Delete sickness compensation, (6) Holidays: National holidays, 8 days per year, with pay, (7) Safety and Hygiene: As soon as more practical regulations are promulgated, they shall be implemented immediately, (8) Apprentices: Follow the original text, (9) Bonuses: The factory shall give bonuses at the end of the year, at least equal to 4% of wages, (10) Labor-management discussion organization (factory meeting): In order to promote labor-management goodwill, both parties shall elect representatives to discuss various issues related to labor and management. Of the above items, only three are related to economy, namely (A) 10-hour work system, (B) 8 days of vacation per year, (C) Bonuses, so there seems to be no major difficulty for immediate implementation. (B) Implemented one year later: Female workers who have worked in the factory for more than one year shall be given four weeks of leave with pay if they encounter childbirth and are certified by a doctor. (C) Implemented two years later: (1) Young workers work 8 hours per day, (2) Young workers and apprentices receive 2 hours of education per day. (D) Implemented three years later: Female workers and young workers are not allowed to work night shifts. After three years, the entire Factory Law will be discussed in detail. (E) Implemented five years later: (1) Rest days, four days per month, (2) Raise the age of young workers, (3) Increase the number of female factory inspectors, (F) Clauses to be postponed: (1) Wages, (2) Special rest days, (3) Work contract, (4) Sickness allowance, (5) Factory meeting. Why should the Factory Law be implemented in stages? There are two main reasons: (1) The implementation of the Factory Law places an economic burden on industry (such as shortening working hours, prohibiting female and child laborers from working night shifts, rest and vacation, maternity allowance, etc.). If these articles are implemented at the same time, I am afraid that the industry cannot bear it. Our country's industry is now in a dangerous position. There is international competition externally, and there are various difficulties in management and labor internally. If a heavier economic burden is added, it will be difficult to develop industry. Therefore, we advocate implementing the Factory Law in stages. For example, in the first year, industry will suffer losses due to shortening working hours. Therefore, the maternity allowance will be implemented in the second year, and so on. (2) There are several clauses in the Factory Law whose implementation must be prepared. For example, prohibiting female and young workers from working night shifts is impossible at present. Because cotton spinning, cotton weaving, silk reeling, and silk weaving industries use a large number of female and young workers. If they are suddenly prohibited, these industries will have great difficulties. Therefore, we advocate abolishing the night work of female and young workers three years after the implementation of the Factory Law. Finally, where should the way in begin? Since we take the Factory Law as the goal, the Factory Law does not need to be revised. The implementing regulations are based on the Factory Law, so they do not need to be revised either. The starting point is the order of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce regarding the temporary measures for certain clauses. It can be stipulated by ministerial order, because the situation of industry and labor is constantly changing, so the ministerial order can also change accordingly. This seems to be the most flexible method. In this way, the Factory Law is the goal of social improvement, and the order of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce is the starting point for realizing this goal.</p>
<p>Letter</p>
<p>Dear Sir, Having read the local news column of your newspaper, which stated that Chinese police officer No. 78 of our police station stopped a ferry from carrying passengers across the river at the Qichang Wharf, almost causing a major disaster, etc., this is inconsistent with the facts. Chinese police officer No. 78 of our police station was patrolling the Qichang Wharf in Pudong by boat at nearly 6 am on the 29th of this month. Later, he saw that the deck of the ferry at the wharf was loaded with more than 100 passengers, exceeding the customs regulations and endangering the safety of the passengers. He stepped forward to stop it and ordered the number of passengers to be reduced before opening. However, the owner of the ferry, Chen Songtao, not only refused, but also gathered a crowd to beat the police officer. The police officer was outnumbered and could not call for help in time. Later, a patrol boat from our police station passed by. Chen Songtao and others stopped when they saw the patrol boat from our police station. The patrol boat did not come to the rescue because it had other important business and did not know about this major change. The police officer took the opportunity to escape to the sampan he had originally taken and tried his best to escape. However, Chen Songtao ordered the ferry to chase back Chinese police officer No. 78. At that time, our police station had received information and sent people to rescue him from danger. Chen Songtao claimed to the passengers, "I am doing this for your benefit, so you should come out and help," and instructed the passengers to swarm and occupy the patrol boat of our police station. After many attempts to persuade them to leave, they were taken to the Customs Shipping Office, and the land police explained the situation in many ways before they dispersed. This is the real situation of what happened. Your newspaper's news has completely erased the facts. Chinese police officer No. 78 has been examined in the hospital, and the hospital has issued an injury report as evidence. In addition to filing a lawsuit with the court according to law to punish the perpetrator, we hereby send a letter to request a correction. Sincerely, to the editor of the Shanghai Shenbao. Sincerely, the New Customs Water Police Station. July 30th.</p>
<p>Dear Sir, Having reviewed the news on the Two-Road Defense Conference published in today's newspaper, the point on the distribution of internal defense is inconsistent with the facts. We hereby send a letter to request a correction. Sincerely, to the Shenbao. Sincerely, the General Staff Office of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters.</p>
<p>July 30th.</p>
<p>Dear Sir, Having read your newspaper's local news column on July 18, which stated that after the dissolution of the Labor University, two young men were seen fleeing from the patrol police. One of them, named Tan Dingxuan, was found to have a communication department of the Lu, Hai, and Kong Army General Headquarters. A symbol of the director of the reporting service, a passport, and it was said that a friend sent him to avoid the fare, etc. After investigation, there is no such person as Tan Dingxuan in this department. The communication department is not organized, and there is no title of director of the reporting service. After sending someone to investigate with the Jiangsu Shanghai Local Court, the seal on the symbol road list held by the young man was indeed forged. In addition to sending a letter to the court to severely punish him to deter others, we hereby send a letter to your newspaper to check and make corrections to clarify the facts and avoid confusing hearsay. Sincerely, to the Editorial Department of the Shanghai Shenbao. Sincerely, the Transportation Department of the Land, Sea and Air Force Headquarters, July 29</p>

<p>— Ke</p>
<p>Just finished supper, everyone was gathered around the dining table chatting and laughing.</p>
<p>"Excuse me, gentlemen, is Mr. Jiang home?" A woman's face was reflected on the glass window.</p>
<p>The light in the room was dazzling, and the woman's face standing in the darkness could only show an outline, as if there was a man's shadow behind her.</p>
<p>"Mr. Jiang? He lives next door," my sister replied.</p>
<p>She thanked them upon hearing that, and went next door. Soon, the door of the dining room opened slightly, and she and a man in his thirties, short in stature with a fierce glint in his eyes, walked in.</p>
<p>"Mr. Jiang is out. This address, thank you, give it to him when he comes back."</p>
<p>Her swollen, pale face showed a humble smile. She extended her chicken claw-like hand, took a slip of paper from the man's hand, placed it on the table, and said to my sister,</p>
<p>She seemed to be around thirty years old, with long hair combed back neatly, and a cheap rhinestone clip from the department store in her hair. Her cheongsam was long and wide, and the hem kept swaying as she walked. The man was wearing a white gauze gown, constantly stroking the short, curly hair on his forehead, his eyes darting swiftly around.</p>
<p>"Thank you for agreeing to my request," the man said, his eyes darting around again. "You're welcome," my sister replied with a smile. They walked out humbly.</p>
<p>"Hmm, Zhang... his accent sounds like he's from our hometown," I said, picking up the piece of paper from the table.</p>
<p>The next morning, there was a rumbling of cars and noisy voices outside the gate. I went to the window to look out and saw the couple from last night moving in with many children, boxes, and furniture, dragging everything along.</p>
<p>The oldest boy, about ten years old, was dragging a pair of worn-out shoes, his upper body naked, his thin arms like withered branches, holding a suckling infant with sores all over its head all day long. His tired eyes and gaunt cheeks seemed to indicate he would never have the joy of a lively childhood.</p>
<p>My sister stood at the entrance of the dining hall.</p>
<p>"The weather is really bad, it's always raining," the newly moved-in woman seemed to be greeting my sister, holding the suckling infant in her arms.</p>
<p>Her collar was open, exposing a sunken chest, showing a sense of weariness from life.</p>
<p>"Yes, it keeps raining like this. I'm afraid this year will be a year of famine," my sister said, moving closer to her.</p>
<p>"Where are you from? X province, right?"</p>
<p>"That's right. My husband is from X province, and I'm from Sichuan."</p>
<p>"Are these two your sons?" my sister asked, as the oldest child came over to hold the suckling infant.</p>
<p>"Yes. Those three are not mine, because my husband has another family," she said, nodding towards the three squalid children standing at the gate.</p>
<p>"Why didn't you see that one?"</p>
<p>"She gave birth to a baby and is in confinement."</p>
<p>"What does Mr. Zhang do now?" my sister asked.</p>
<p>"Him? He used to be a battalion commander, and later he worked in many government offices, and also..." she said happily, but suddenly Mr. Zhang came back from outside, glanced at her, and she slowly stopped talking and walked silently into her room.</p>
<p>There were ten of them in total: the couple, six children, and a nanny, all living in one side room. Standing at the entrance of the dining room, we could see their room's furnishings completely.</p>
<p>A long white wooden table was placed by the window, and against the wall was a black, oily square table and two broken wooden chairs with missing armrests. Inside, several small iron beds were vaguely visible, cluttered and messy. The room was dirty and disorderly.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang was busy hanging something, hanging it on the wall in the middle of the black, oily main table. He slowly lowered it with his hand, gradually revealing a half-length portrait of the Premier.</p>
<p>"Underneath it should be his will," I thought.</p>
<p>He then nailed a blue paper scroll under the portrait. Indeed, it was the will. Then, on both sides should be—"The revolution has not yet succeeded, comrades must still strive on"—this couplet.</p>
<p>Indeed, he hung them all up as before, but there was no Party flag crossed.</p>
<p>One day, we were having lunch when a scolding tone came from the side room next door.</p>
<p>"What do you want to eat? Is this kind of dish not to your liking? If you don't eat, then don't eat it!"</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang was sitting by the window, with preserved eggs, smoked fish, a bowl of steaming braised pork, and a glass of wine in front of him, the glass filled with deep yellow wine. He sipped his wine slowly, watching inside and scolding, but not as if he was angry, more like a leisurely form of entertainment.</p>
<p>"I know, what to eat? You eat fish, eat meat, and drink wine," she coughed twice, spat, and said, "But we women only have this salty pickled vegetable. What we wear and use, isn't it all brought by me? You heartless man!"</p>
<p>"Conscience? What conscience? If I had a conscience, I wouldn't have remarried," Mr. Zhang sneered.</p>
<p>"This, this is..." her voice gradually faded, "Heartless man, how did you entice and deceive me in the beginning, but now..." She was crying, her voice so blurred that it was indistinguishable.</p>
<p>"Forget it, is this a big deal? There are never good words in an argument," the nanny said softly, trying to persuade her.</p>
<p>"We always argue like this, wherever we are, it's always like this," Mr. Zhang said, seemingly proud.</p>
<p>"You better not interfere in this matter."</p>
<p>Indeed, Mr. Zhang had been here for six or seven days, and they had already argued more than ten times.</p>
<p>Although the rain had stopped, the dripping water from the eaves still sounded "drip, drip". The weather at the end of July was as cool as late autumn. I was reading a newly translated Norwegian play when the next door started arguing as usual.</p>
<p>At first, the sound was so low that it was unclear, but gradually the sound grew louder.</p>
<p>"Shameless, you should know how shameless you are!" Mr. Zhang shouted loudly.</p>
<p>"That's right, shameless, shameless. Anyway, I'm shameless. You cheated me, you cheated my family that there were no women, is that having a face?"</p>
<p>"Bandit, you are a bandit!"</p>
<p>This time, it was not as easy to calm down as before. The noise grew more and more intense.</p>
<p>"Bandit? Who is a bandit?" Mr. Zhang asked sharply.</p>
<p>"You, you are a bandit!"</p>
<p>"Okay, show me the evidence!"</p>
<p>"Kidnapping women, cheating money, isn't that a bandit? Evidence?" she laughed sharply. "I am the real evidence!"</p>
<p>Before she finished speaking, there was a loud bang, and the woman cried loudly.</p>
<p>"You hit me, you dare to hit me! Come on!" There was a crash, like the sound of a woman being knocked down.</p>
<p>"Bitch, hitting you, what about hitting you!" There were continuous sounds of hitting.</p>
<p>"Murder! Help!..." The woman screamed hoarsely.</p>
<p>The woman in confinement had a black crepe scarf tied around her head, her face pale and yellow, her frightened eyes constantly looking out the window.</p>
<p>Somehow, the woman broke free, desperately running out the door, like a captured mouse escaping the cat's mouth.</p>
<p>"Bandit, watch, I'm going to report to the police station! You..." she shouted, stumbling towards the entrance of the alley.</p>
<p>"What? You held me tight, but let her run to the police station? This is possible! She, she will be unfavorable to me!" Mr. Zhang pushed to the left and shrugged to the right, trying to break free from Mr. Jiang's hand that was holding him. Finally, he pushed away the people surrounding him and ran after the woman like a flying arrow. At this time, the number of people watching the excitement in the alley gradually increased, and everyone ran after them.</p>
<p>The sky was dark like ink, with thick clouds all around. The ground, which had just rained, had puddles of muddy water accumulating on the stone slabs, which were stepped on by many feet, making a "gurgling" sound. The muddy water splashed in all directions, like the spray of a fountain.</p>
<p>The group of people who had just run past in the mud ran back, this time running in front of the main character.</p>
<p>"I'll be beaten to death if I go back! I, I'm not going back!"</p>
<p>The woman struggled desperately, the collar of her clothes torn, with a crack down the middle, half of the front dragging to her knees, revealing a skeletal chest.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang didn't say a word, tightly biting his teeth.</p>
<p>With one hand pinching her hands and one hand waving away the crowd, he ran straight in.</p>
<p>The woman was dragged involuntarily, her feet like floating on the ground, dragged into the gate. She screamed sharply.</p>
<p>"No, don't go in! I'd rather die outside!"</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang still didn't say anything, just dragging her in with force, his eyes shooting out a murderous look, as terrifying as a half-crazed beast.</p>
<p>"Help! I'll be beaten to death if I go in... no, don't go in! Help!..."</p>
<p>The woman screamed like a pig being slaughtered, her whole body thrown into the muddy water. The light from the dining hall shone on her disheveled hair, swollen eye sockets, and face smeared with blood, like a mud bodhisattva washed by rain.</p>
<p>A general feeling of anger, like it was about to burst through my chest, my brain, I couldn't help but shout, "Hit, hit, hit this bully of women!"</p>
<p>This sudden shout passed through everyone's faces like lightning, instantly igniting the flames they had been harboring, and all together, like a wave crashing against the rocks, they furiously condemned Mr. Zhang. Seeing that everyone was hostile towards him, he let go, and said with an unnatural sneer,</p>
<p>"Nothing, I didn't hit her, please rest assured."</p>
<p>…………………………</p>
<p>"Gentlemen, listen to him, he is a liar. He, he beat me so cruelly, look!" She slowly got up from the ground, lifted her trousers and sleeves, and blue-purple wounds were scattered on her bony limbs. She panted and said,</p>
<p>"Gentlemen, he is so cruel. He beat me until I'm sick, and I often cough up blood. Please judge fairly, gentlemen, should he be like this? He..."</p>
<p>"Ah, how can he be so cruel?" a middle-aged man said, shaking his head.</p>
<p>"In a fight, women are always weaker, but men should have some conscience," said Mrs. Qiu, who lived in the front house.</p>
<p>"I am also a husband, but I have never treated a woman like this."</p>
<p>"Yes, if all men were like him, the women in the world would probably be exterminated."</p>
<p>"Ah, it's rare to see such a fierce person."</p>
<p>"……………………"</p>
<p>"He... ugh..." The woman cried sadly and continued, "Alright, don't talk nonsense, the neighbors have been annoyed enough by our noise," Mr. Zhang said to her in a low voice, then smiled and greeted everyone,</p>
<p>"Sorry, we made a fuss. I'm very sorry, please everyone take a rest."</p>
<p>The people watching the excitement saw that things had calmed down and felt it was boring, so they dispersed.</p>
<p>The woman was dragged into the room by Mr. Zhang with a mixture of intimidation and coaxing. There was indeed no more beating that night, but the woman sobbed and cried like a ghost all night long.</p>
<p>The next day, the side room next door was empty, showing a kind of quiet atmosphere. We didn't see them again after that.</p>
<p>Later, I heard from the landlord next door - Mr. Jiang, Mr. Zhang's friend - that,</p>
<p>She was a widow. After her husband died, he left some property and a child. Mr. Zhang, because of his friendship with her deceased husband, took the opportunity to seduce her, saying that he had been a battalion commander, how rich his family was, that he had not yet married, how sincerely he loved her, and that he would always love her passionately—but later, after he used up her property, he would often beat her over a small matter. This time, I heard it was just because she wanted to buy four copper coins' worth of white sugar.</p>
