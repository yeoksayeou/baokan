<p>時評</p>
<h3>最近各國之革命觀</h3>
<p>自最近南中美與南歐之革命風雲起。而世界各國之不滿於政府者。常有革命之暴發而其間有成有不成。如最近之西班牙。是革命而成者也。最近之葡萄牙與宏都拉斯。是革命而不成者。葡萄牙之政府軍。團革命軍於馬提拉島革命軍提出投降條件。而政府不許。政府海軍陸戰隊。隨時可以衝入島上云。宏都拉斯之政府軍。未及一星期。已將叛亂漸次削平。各陣綫戰事。皆獲勝利。據稱數日之內。即可完復各地。是葡宏兩國之革命。日後如何。雖不可知而此次則已完全失敗矣。</p>
<p>大抵革命之成否。雖亦有時値乎時機。然亦有總原因在。總原因維何。即所謂政府者。太不適於當時之國情。爲國中大多數人所厭棄。則其革命也必成。反之而政府尙未至國中大多數人厭棄之程度。徒以一小部分人與政府意見不合。欲藉在握之一種權力。以圖革命。則非遇特別有利之時機。則成者實鮮。蓋以政府苟非爲衆所共棄。則其運用各種權力。究勝於革命者也。</p>

<h3>開幕典禮</h3>
<p>游行已畢、各校男女選手、如一字陣、面對主席台、軍樂聲中、莊嚴偉大之空前盛會、徐徐揭起幕布、舉行典禮、秩序如下、（一）全體肅立、（二）奏樂、（三）唱黨歌、（四）向國旗及總理遺像行最敬禮、（五）主席徐佩璜恭讀總理遺囑、（六）靜默、（七）主席徐佩璜報告、（八）會長代表俞鴻鈞致詞、（九）市黨部代表童行白致詞、（十）名譽指導褚輔臣致詞、（十）（一）來賓朱應鵬演說、（十）（二）禮成、</p>
<p>主席徐佩璜報告　略謂今日本市第一次舉行中等學校聯合運動會、主旨在普及中等學校之體育並測騐中等學校之體育程度、此次參加之運動員人數、共五百十九人、內男子甲組三百二十八人、男子乙組九十八人、女子九十三人、各校性質、計省立二、國立二、市立五、私立大學附中三、私立大學附中未立案者十八、可歸納爲（一）公立及私立之立案者、（二）中學未立案而經立案手續者、最後當感謝中華全國體育協進會假予塲地、各局及各體育專家之贊助、曁上中及東亞等童子軍之維持秩序、</p>
<p>會長張岳軍致詞　張市長代表俞鴻鈞略謂、奉市長之命、參加第一次舉行之中校聯合運動會開幕隆重典禮、此次參加之公私男女學生、本平素鍛練所得、表演身手、斯日練成堅强體格、即爲他年投身社會及服務國家之用、提倡運動、可以（一）餋成克己精神、（二）餋成紀律觀念、（三）光明正大手段來競爭、盼望各運員發展各個體育及體育美德、並與年俱進云、</p>

<p>來賓朱應鵬演說　朱君略謂、吾人與西人並肩相視、顯有高下强弱之分、西人之所以强大者、緣於數千年來不絕鍛練、得以保持原來民族之體格、國人兒將體育一事、置在人生一切事物之外、此種錯誤觀念、遂造成今日又小又弱之民族、今當力求進步、俾與又長又大之西洋民族同樣强健、</p>

<p>鄒彬因家境赤貧</p>
<p>又聞其父之死耗</p>
<p>受刺激服毒圖盡</p>
<p>灌救尙早可不死</p>
<p>上海美術專科學校學生鄒彬、昨晨在宿舍中服毒自殺、經學校當局送往醫院救治、大致尙可挽回、鄒於服毒前、作遺書二十餘封、分致師長學友、上校長一函、內有「歷年處境艱難、近復遭亡父之痛、輾轉思維、惟有一死了之」、等語、另有絕命書一封、內多牢騷語、其中一段云「彬本屬寒士、賴衆師友慷慨資助、始得負笈美專、現彬學未成而身先死、枉負師友宏培、心實痛裂」、鄒自殺之原因、及其環境狀况、可於上述兩段文字中得之也、</p>

<h3>楊大慘死眞相</h3>
<p>奸夫奪妻演此慘劇</p>
<p>殺後移屍至小溝旁</p>
<p>滬西星加坡路東洋絹絲廠東首弄內草棚中之江北人楊大、忽於本月廿三日（即前日）晚間被人戳斃、巳誌昨日本報、茲悉是案之眞相係一奸夫奪妻慘殺案、爰將詳情、探錄於下、</p>
<p>死者近狀　江北鹽城人楊大、年約三十左右、娶有一妻某氏、年約二十四五、夫婦兩人本居於閘北長安路小花園後草棚中、楊曾在閘北某探員處充跑腿之職、近來以拉車爲業、前日遷居星加坡路後、亦曾拉車一日、</p>
<p>被殺原因　據該處鄰近人云、其妻某氏、容貌雖甚惡劣、而性頗風騷、早與兇手發生戀愛、時假旅館幽會、迄今已有數月、楊雖知之而因勢不敵、故亦祗得忍氣呑聲而已、近因其妻大變常態、時欲與楊齟齬、楊乃鑒於情形不正、遂突然迫妻於本月二十日遷居於此、以爲暫避之計、不料奸夫竟下此毒手、即將其妻携之而去、得以遂其慾壑、</p>
<p>慘殺經過　該草棚中之二房東陳潘氏、於二十日忽有同居之王振淸、介紹楊大夫婦二人租屋一間、當即遷入居住、該二房東因鑒其夫妻不睦、時生齟齬、故其妻姓何、亦並未詢悉、詎祗居住兩日、至本月廿三日晚十一時許、正在熟睡之際、突有多人破門而入、即將楊大兇毆、該二房東陳潘氏聞聲驚起、正欲呌喊、該兇手六七人各執利刃鐵棍、嚇禁聲張、該氏見狀股慄、祗得裹於被內、各兇手將楊戳斃之後、將尸拖至附近小河溝旁、乃即携同楊妻逃遁、翌早四時許、該二房東起而察視、見地上血流淋漓、尋至溝旁、方見楊尸裸體在地、後即投報六區警署、</p>
<p>房東供詞　任區長得報後、立即派員前往查堪尸體、察得太陽穴有一刀傷、後脖子有一棍傷、左腰有一鐵棍挿入肉內、約有三寸左右、尙未抽拔出、後在其房中搜出警笛一只、鑰匙三把、日記簿一本、卡片六張、門生帖一張、借據一紙、賬簿一本、當又將介紹人王振淸一併拘回署內、經任區長訊據二房東陳潘氏供、年四十歲、鹽城人、住居絹絲廠旁弄內草棚、本月二十日由同居王振淸介紹楊大夫妻二人租住屋內、迄今祗有兩日、惟彼男女兩人入屋之後、向不和睦、詎於昨日晚間、忽聞有人破門而入、將楊兇毆、我擬呌喊、六七人各執利刃、嚇禁聲張、祗得藏入被中、直至今晨四時起身、方見楊尸已拋於溝旁、血流淋漓、慘不忍覩、其妻已不知去向等語、又據王振淸供、年三十歲、鹽城人、居住址同上、楊大前居於閘北長安路小花園後草棚中、我於去年四月間與伊相識、前二日突來托我尋屋、故即介紹租住於此、至其被殺原因、實不知悉等語、任區長得供後、以案關謀殺人命、旋即備文併解法院訊辦、</p>
<h3>梳櫳後謂非處女</h3>
<p>妓女羞憤自殺</p>
<p>老八於情可憫</p>
<p>狎客問心安乎</p>
<p>吳地多佳麗、而小家碧玉、因慕海上繁華、輒喜溷跡平康、度其浪漫生活、雲南路會樂里三百二十一號書寓妓女柳燕燕之房侍老八、亦其一也、八氏段、曰阿二、芳齡三七、猶屬小姑、家貧如洗、問字無人、始於春初卸除荊布、投入綺羅、走馬章臺者、涎其色、餌以金錢、冀親香澤、自來鴇兒愛鈔、而况八懷春已久、於是水到渠成、乃梳櫳之後、客忽靳夜度資、謂八非處子、使八無從分辯、前晨該客范全根又至八院、八與口角、俟范去後、深自怨艾、以恥辱太甚、何顏見人、遽萌自殺之念、獨於室內潛服阿芙蓉膏、然後臥牀待斃、直至午後一時、同院姊妹入室喚八午餐、不聞聲息、揭帳諦視、詎已玉殞香消、</p>

<p>第一編　此編爲報告之緒言、工部局董事、一致敦請費唐君担任調查、所有調查之綠起範圍、以及方法、均於緒言內叙明、費唐君抵滬以後、不久即於一九三零年一月十五日、致函工部局總董、說明其職權範圍、此函亦經在緒言內引錄、就該函所表示而言、工部局所請費唐君担承之職務、係「爲工部局顧問、協助該局籌擬建設計畫、將中國人民之願望、充分考量、同時並對於集在上海發展之偉大商務利益、給以合乎情理之充分保障」、報告內提明、就此種職權範圍而言、調查之範圍甚廣、乃將其職務性質叙明如左、因此、鄙人之職務、不僅限於研究上海公共租界、及與該租界毘連地點之經濟社會行政、以及政治之確實情狀、並須對於上海所屬環境之現狀、知其槪略、換言之、即國內一般經濟政治以及行政之背景、亦須知悉、上海之特別問題、須從此項背景觀察、而後能知各該問題之眞相、及其比例、設非先知中國之一般現狀、旣不能使所擬之上海治制、與全國進步所趨向之目的、成立一種適宜之關係、亦不能對於任何所擬之改革事宜、爲之籌擬進行之方法、並定其進行之程序、而使有關係之經濟利益、得有所需之保障、惟此種普通背景、固常須記憶在懷、而鄙人之初步工作、則當然在研究上海本身而尤須明瞭上海工商業之性質與範圍、所以能爲商業中心之確實基礎、以及公共租界現行治制之特色、關於公共租界將來之任何計劃、界內之中外團體、當然有首先發表意見之權、鄙人對於此項意見、亦須訪查明晰、加以考量、調查之手續如何、經在報告內摘要開列、所得消息之各種來源、亦經提及、此外並經指明、就上海之通行情勢而論、公開調查、事難辦到、與中國多數其他中心地點相比、上海較有討論之自由、其主要理由、爲有在西報發表對於時事問題意見之便利、但即在上海、如欲自由公開討論政治問題、在外人爲困難、在華人大槪爲不可能之事、報告又言商會·銀行公會、代表商業利益之其他團體、以及某某華人機關、均曾將直接或間接關係政治問題之富有價値說帖見貺、並許刊布、但以個人意見見告之人、大都見告之時、均有明定條件、即欲提及若輩意見之時、不得披露發表意見者之爲誰氏、受有此項限制而向各方面所得之協助與建議、均足誌感、</p>
<p>第二編　此編內容之大槪性質如下、公共租界現有各機關之能發展至現時程度、係由於逐漸之演進、欲爲租界前途籌擬一種建設計劃、必先研究此種演進之經過、否則目前所應解决之各種問題、無由明哳、即對於各該問題之眞確關係、不能了解、所以第二編之內容、係如其標題所列、爲追溯其歷史、並叙述其狀况、第二編第一章、略叙上海之現時狀况、及其行政之區域、第二章叙述公共租界之緣起與發展、其中提明、該租界發生之初、原視爲英僑之居留地、但英國當道並未堅持、謂係僅爲英僑而設、所以多數他國之人民、得在租界內享受同等權利、並得平等參與政事、屬爲此種性質之租界、與專由一國管辖之讓與地、顯有重要之區別、其稱爲租界而不稱爲上海讓與地、（法租界不在其列）亦有重要之結果、報告中對於此種重要之點、提及如下、上海之公共租界、初僅蕞爾之地、原係劃作英僑居留之處、其後逐漸擴大、中國其他通商口岸之租界、彼此分離、地相交錯、而上海之公共租界、則爲混合性質、成一單個之自治團體、界內多數各國人民、同受治於平民市制之下、並將有限制之監督權保留、而使屬於享受治外法權、並有其本國人民居住界內之各國領事團體、而非屬於任何一國之領事、上海外僑團體之組織特色如是、而與上海公共租界有關係之國、爲數又多乃使上海之歷史情形複雜、並使在進步方面時、比僅由一外國管理之租界爲緩、且更困難、但聯合之結果、可以增添實力、增加獨立方法、而使外僑全體、非特對於市政之担承、其規模比由其他地點分別管理之區域爲大、其活動之範圍、亦較爲廣闊、並可發展一種國際合作之習慣、此種習慣、自有其特殊之價値、且在將來、或可證明關係日重、</p>

<h3>戲癖大王的逸事</h3>
<p>— 蟬退</p>
<p>戲是娛樂。還是藝術。在這裏都不成問題。即如我的老友戲癖大王。與其稱贊他的政法。宣揚他的文學。都是錯了。大王就是愛看戲。在上海當學生時代。除了上課之外。沒有一天不看戲。有錢看池座。無錢看起碼。風雨無阻。眞是看戲的信人。而且他專誠是看戲不作捧角的文章。亦不作批評戲劇的評論。家家戲園都到。各各角兒都識。這已夠了戲癖的資格。然非大王的神聖之尊嚴。自畢業於上海。即受聘於遼寗。初爲教員。繼爲秘書。每値長期的暑假。或是因公進京。大王沒有一天不在大柵欄各戲園。大王嘗說。「看戲必於北京方知京調之爲美。」至於大王之在奉天。即更是沒有一天不看戲。</p>
<p>張大元帥之開府於北平。大王職位旣高。趨承日衆。而大王之癖好看戲仍如故。要有一天不看戲。就覺精神不快。於是京外的朋友。都以戲癖大王相稱。甚至張大元帥亦以此呼之。</p>
<p>大元帥府中謀臣如雲。將士如雨。每値公餘之暇。列坐左右。或談政治。或言歷史。大元帥昏昏欲睡。若無所聞。惟有大王所言。乃係戲園三十年之掌故。而其探討之源皆由心得。並不納交一個戲界。亦不撰著一文。登載各報。大王所持以爲證者便是三十年來的戲單。北京原無戲單。有大王親筆日記。故大王所說的掌故。是看戲的掌故。不是戲界的掌故。所以大元帥聞大王所說。拈髭而微笑。大王自畢業去滬。距今已有二十五年。而這二十五年在遼寗。在北平。在天津。在山東。在廣東。都有戲單的存在。就是在上海讀書五年。來往於南京鎭江蘇州各處。無處不以看戲爲事。即無處不有戲單的存在。故即將這些戲單彙集一處。已有兩大箱之多。</p>
<p>大王今年壽已花甲。家人催歸符至。乃向張副司令辭職。張副司令篤敬故交。贈以三萬金的養老金。並派副官一人伴送南歸。茲來上海。已經三日。遍歷各戲塲。風景依稀。舉目有山河之異。</p>
<p>昨日特來過訪。相見有如隔世。我以戲癖大王之逸事。豈可不傳留於上海。爲看戲者模範。故特撰此文以張之。</p>

<h3>弄堂笑史</h3>
<p>— 醉痴生</p>
<p>社會本如魔窟。弄堂儘多笑話。朅来红雨添愁。綠窗無俚。偶記數則。聊博一粲。</p>
<p>突如其來代搬場　某日之晨。有搬塲汽車開至弄口。戞然而止。旋有一男一婦率領夫役數人。直入某姓家。将室中红木器具等。纷纷搬取。並代赴附近警局報告遷移。將各物運上汽車。疾馳而去。而某姓婦反避匿隣家。時同居及隣人覩此怪狀。咸莫明其妙。嗣向婦致詰。婦始含淚謂其夫有盤龍癖。屢戒不悛。昨夜在北里某賭窟博。始則小勝。繼竟大負。除罄囊所有外。尙負欠千餘金。局中人聲勢洶洶。卒勒書筆據。許以家中紅木傢具抵償。故今日即來搬取云云。衆聞言。咸嘆婦之遇人不淑。婦以家徒四壁。不可一朝居。翌日收拾餘物衣服。與所天悄然他徙。不知所之。</p>
<p>大家請看模特兒　前弄有某姓夫婦。所居係單幢東洋式。婦年甫十七。稚氣未除。平日輒笑臉迎人。憨態可掬。日前因天熱。在樓下室中閉戶沐浴。爲貼隣某作塲夥所悉。就窗外偷窺春色。旋聞風來者。愈聚愈衆。婦大窘。忽突然起立。赤裸裸向衆宣言曰。「索性請你們看個爽快。也沒要緊。」衆始驚避。作鳥獸散。婦猶欣然語人曰。此欲縱故擒。阿儂退兵之妙計也。聞者大噱。</p>
<p>解鈴還問繫鈴人　隣有某甲。執業於某輪船。居家時少。其婦不耐獨宿。與同居某乙私。乙固鰥夫。二人陳倉暗渡。已非一朝一夕。正在歡會。甲突自外歸。乙狼狽避去。而甲不知也。越日。乙驚恐之餘。寒熱大發。勢成傷寒。乙母憂甚。謂咎由婦召。大興問罪之師。婦亦理屈。願擔任醫藥之資。每日並由婦保抱。同乘一人力車。伴往就醫。厥狀至趣。見者尙以爲夫婦云。</p>
<h3>歌舞一夕話</h3>
<p>— 地號</p>
<p>昨晚觀「邊省奇俠」影片於夏令配克大戲院。劇終將返。驟聞幕後有無數少女之喧譁聲。異之。觀衆均退。余獨駐足審視。並探詢侍者。始知係麗娃歌舞班之演員也。侍者云。該班於二十五日起即在本院公演。故於今晚在台上作化裝最後之排練。余素好歌舞。且麗娃兩字已深印腦海。不知內容如何。爲好奇心所誘。商得該班某君之同意。乃得重行入座。一飽眼福。</p>
<p>該班排練之歌舞劇。凡靑春月下心儷影洛神四齣。「靑春」登台之演員。凡三十二人。服裝頗新奇。劇情亦有含蓄。最精采處在末一塲三十二人之合舞。舉凡手之一動。足之一舉。均合節奏。而十分整齊。斷非數日之功夫可以致此也。「月下心」劇情歌詞。俱頗超越。一男一女同站於懸空之月牙中。四週星光燦爛。幽麗可喜。觀至失戀之少女於月下悲歌一段。令人凄然淚下。「儷影」登台演員凡十八人。第一段大致爲全世界平常之男子。齊向一超然之女子求愛。結果均失望。第二段爲全世界平常之女子。向一超然之男子求愛。亦均失望。最後一對超人互相愛好。全世界之平常男女均各同病相憐。而互相愛好。該劇之蓄意。似謂「世界上最完美之婚姻。祗有鏡架中的儷影」而已。「洛神」登台演員凡六十五人。服裝佈景之富麗新頴。以該劇爲最。聞該班某君云。一帽之費。須美金百兩左右。末一場之六十五人同舞同歌。壯嚴偉大。確爲歌舞界之盛舉也。</p>
<h3>我亦談談推拿</h3>
<p>— 士敏</p>
<p>曩讀頴川秋水諸君述推拿源流。引經據典。至爲詳贍。不侫於推拿一道。未窺門徑。不敢妄贊一辭。今茲所紀。係故老相傳。僅足供談助耳。按推拿之術。以一指禪爲正宗。其力足以治百病。惜習此而底於大成者。百不得一。迨明淸之交。有隱士佚其名。老諸生也。博學多能。於推拿有獨到處。創新法多種。邁越古人。鼎革後益致力於此道。手鈔精本數冊。萃達摩一指禪之精蘊。而參以己見。圖說詳備。闡發甚精審。隱士死。此秘本流落人間。至嘉慶間。輾轉歸江都鹺商黃氏。聞黃氏之得此書也。徒以其書法遒勁。而望氣篇中有圖像。婦科門中有半裸形。頗得名家畫意。故遂出資收買。視同尋常骨董耳。後黃氏衰。子弟中有名艾生者。方治醫學。發篋見之。大喜。昕夕研求。多所領悟。後遂以一指禪推拿鳴於時。即今懸壼於上海南成都路之黃漢如醫生也。漢如妻漢芸。及其子名一照者。皆能得其薪傳。蓋多得力於此秘本云。</p>

<p>日本文豪菊池寬。著作等身。文名藉甚。粥文以行數計。一紙論値。其數可觀。雖一行一字。書賈亦計値如數。風聲所播。一時傳爲美談。不謂無獨有偶。一幀照片。有給獎至一萬美金者。後先輝映。亦云奇已。</p>
<p>發起此項獎金者。爲雅負物望之柯達公司。嘗於二年前。發起攝影比賽。今歲再接再厲。發起世界攝影大比賽。以十萬駐金作獎。惟祇限自習攝影者加入。俾得獎機分六十等。以增興趣。我華方面。獎額亦不在少。種類甚多。有六大分類獎。省區獎。全國大獎一千元等名目。每類得第一獎之照片。彙齊後送往日內瓦。評定甲乙。獲首獎者。美金千元。全世界最佳之一幀。給獎美金一萬元。並攝影女神彫刻像一座。是則一幀照片。連續得獎之金額。誠有超過萬金以上者。方今商戰日亟。競爭日烈。類多出奇制勝。以冀所業之無遠弗屆。柯達公司此舉。借題發揮。營業可操左券。一擲萬金。亦可謂豪矣。</p>
<h3>印度遊記（三四）</h3>
<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>本日有中國僧人數名。從北印度朝佛山南返者。過加爾吉打。將返仰光。亦住中國市四邑館觀音廟內。來大乘佛會看佛舍利。余生平未及見之。今乃亦敬觀之。由大乘佛會秘書辛漢君敬開壇示覽。在一小寶塔內。塔金色。時爲下午一時晴明日。在樓上佛堂。日光正射入。余與三人東向而觀。一塊爲佛骨。約重半兩。年久有微黑色。旁一粒爲所謂舍利者。如麥粒大。正圓。色純白。日光返射。微有霞彩光。余等敬禮之。有號活佛僧人好禮拜。聞一言之善。則拜。彼乃頂戴小塔於頭。而誦眞言。可十分時。又置余等三人之首而頂戴之。謂可直接佛慧云。余昔嘗聞人言。佛舍利能放光。又能自飛去。自减少或增多。又云其色隨各人所見而不同。上者見金光。中者見白光。下者見黑色。余之腦蓋十之七八物質科學腦筋。而亦不否認。精神尙不敢斷定此言合乎物質科學否。抑佛果有神通。舍利隨人程度而所見之色不同也。記得十年前。日本大隈重信任內閣時。暹羅王以佛舍利贈日本。大隈曾發起由內閣發起捐一百十萬以建塔藏之。不知其事究如何。抑經地震以后又如何也。</p>
<p>余問辛漢君。此舍利非藏於錫蘭者。乃藏於印度某地者。舍利有佛菩薩及羅漢之不同。蓋非骨也。而修道法身之結精。猶道教之云成丹矣。據人云。凡人修道成者。均可於焚身後得舍利佛。滅後其骨火化分爲若干段。舍利爲若干。歸各國王分取。而各建寶塔以存之。此事詳於大湼盤經。除神話余不敢輕信外。要之至少佛乃一大哲學教師。其生也淡泊以度衆生。其歿也焚化其尸骨以分贈親友弟子。碎骨粉身。以期感化衆生之愚頑。使之歸於正智。解脫如此。亦已足矣。墨稱摩頂放踵。利天下爲之。佛乃碎骨焚身以留紀念。其親切憐憫人甚矣哉。而湼盤經記各國王又因爭佛骨幾至用武。眞可笑也。然幸我爲一平民。故觀佛骨無人干涉。若爲皇帝者。欲一觀佛骨而不可必得。韓愈先生又大書抗疏以爭之。反添出煩惱。可見皇帝不及平民之自由也。</p>
<p>二十一日讀一書。名加爾吉打。乃西夫老瓦所著。Hassan　Suprawardy述英人最初征服印度事。乃吾人所樂聞者也。摘數條於下。其略初於西一六二五年。首到印度者爲葡萄牙人。及荷蘭人。經營商店於湖格利河口。即恒河口也。又三十餘年。爲一六五八年。英人始到經商。其商團名東印度商會。East　India　Company是時已近十七世紀。英商務在此者甚盛。經營之小村。名河邊村。乃英人發展之根據地也。時勢出英雄。商會中一經理人。名克雷兆者Senior　Agent　Jot　Charnock（舊譯克雷飛當是粵音也）於一六八二年至印度。乃據此商會機關而創統一印度之政府。克雷兆者。乃英征服印度之創造者也。</p>

<p>輾轉於三十兩內外　自早市六月期標金開盤僅降一兩八錢、計七百二十六兩五錢、惟大條已升十六分之五、銀價加二分之一、私電亦加八分之三、然春源永義豐永益餘等均有納進、故回高五錢、計二十七兩、餘大永豐及套頭等售出、當跌至二十四兩一錢、片刻間從容而高、乃大德成恒餘宏利等落手購進、且以同業扖結英金、計六月份一三半、故九點十八分漲爲三十兩零一二錢、斯時套頭等脫售、且料先令有掛長之勢遂退至二十九兩、至滙豐掛牌揭曉計升二五、美金五角、日金跌二分七五、時爲二十八兩二錢、但無過於影響、實係內部尙穩、繼由滙豐華比等出一三四三七五、並由天裕永志豐永等之前來買進、以故漸漸抬高五六兩、至九點五十餘分計爲三十四兩二錢、十點後復反下降、惟有二三兩蘊伏、乃英金似鬆、可結半便士、而檯面上永豐同太昌福昌等皆有出售、遂已打破三十兩關、十一點以後尤見軟化、住友售出英金六二五、殆十一點三十餘分爲二十七兩八錢、頃刻大興永來進、拉上四兩、計三十二兩、志豐永物品來賣、將屆收市抑至三十兩0二三錢、迨午收三十一兩二錢、復又抬上一兩餘、揭價改爲七百七十一兩、計撳四十兩前後、</p>
<p>買戶活動漸露好面　後市開盤三十三兩、嗣由三十二兩半加至三十七兩、乃元茂永買進、而匯市尙穩、中央售與三井朝鮮等八月花旗三十一元四三七五至三七五、繼因元亨福昌售出、遂退爲卅五兩二錢、復由乾昌祥源成恒興并某銀行買進、且英金僅結四三七五、當即上騰四兩、至二點一刻爲三十九兩、往後福昌大德成等賣出、已潛小面、惟時進時退、計有二兩餘盤頭、至三點半後爲三十五兩半、恒興志豐永等買進、復已好起二兩餘、至三點四十餘分爲三十七兩七錢、入後隆甡等賣意不怠、重處萎勢、瀉落四兩六七錢、至四點二十餘分爲三十三兩、斯時同太昌等買進、又拉上二兩半、迨四點三十分收市爲三十五兩半、重又做至三十六兩七八錢、比較上日、（照掛牌）計漲七兩二、終日最大價三十九兩、最小價二十四兩一錢、計有十四兩九錢差次、物品早市三十五兩半、午收二兩五、下午三兩、收市六兩二錢、揭價計掀小三十七八兩至三十三四兩、登賬上午二十九兩三十一兩、下午三十四兩三十六兩、補水二十五兩三十兩、</p>

<p>英匯　內盤計有一八七五升降、上午出價一先令三便士半、買價五六二五、三井於晨初買八月五六二五至六二五、旣而上海三井華比出六月半便士、安達出浙江進四月半便士、匯豐華比出六月四三七五、三井進七月同價、三井出六月同價、住友出五六二五至六二五、午時正金出半便士、午收平平、下午匯豐出半便士、華比出四三七五、三井大通同價出、旋後麥行匯豐亦同價售出、迨收市出價約計半便士、買價五六二五、因半便士不易可賣、</p>

<h3>洋厘果爾抬漲</h3>
<p>按目前洋厘趨勢、本有賡續激漲可能、祗以各方面形勢所趨、不過遽現、但雖不漲終不能降、結果盤旋許久、毫無善狀、昨晨因銀行殷購、客銷亦暢、於是價格上騰、迫近三分關口、而日前本報之推測、今已騐矣、惟厥後能否超出大關、係一問題、照情形而論、則三分以上可預卜焉、</p>
<p>厘拆價格　「洋厘」早市釐價遽爾高至七錢二分九厘半、雖較前日早市僅好七毫半、然形勢堅挺、誠恐有繼漲之象、午市同價、「銀拆」早午兩市同爲二分、劃頭又爲白劃、銀根之鬆、依然毫無升氣、</p>
<p>輔幣市情　江南小洋早市爲六錢五分、較前日好起三厘、午市突又續漲七厘、爲六錢五分七厘、結果兩市間共漲一分之巨、做出交易早市二千五百角、午市七千角、廣東小洋早市爲六錢四分二厘半、午市同價、做出交易早市七萬五千角、午市三萬五千角、銅元改縮一千五百文、爲三百六十九千文、</p>

<h3>證券　債價微跌</h3>

<p>Important Domestic Telegrams</p>
<h3>China-Netherlands, China-Norway</h3>
<p>Legal Rights Negotiations Resolved</p>
<p>Two Agreements Signed the Day Before Yesterday</p>
<p>Significant Progress in Negotiations with Britain</p>
<p>Negotiations with the United States Concluded</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Since the Legal Rights Negotiations were resolved by the Diplomatic Group meeting this week, and Minister Wang actively proceeded, the situation has taken a sharp turn for the better in the past few days. Except for the British and American sides, which are still in negotiations, the issue of legal rights with Norway was resolved at 3 PM on the 23rd, when Minister Wang and Norwegian Minister Aubert signed the China-Norway Agreement on Resolving the Abolition of Consular Jurisdiction. On the China-Netherlands side, Minister Wang and Dutch Minister Oudendijk also signed the China-Netherlands Agreement on Resolving the Abolition of Consular Jurisdiction at 8:50 PM on the same day. It is heard that in addition to the China-Norway and China-Netherlands agreements, there are also four exchanges of notes between Minister Wang and the Norwegian and Dutch ministers. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs originally intended not to announce them temporarily, fearing that Britain and the United States would be unwilling to lag behind, causing complications. On the morning of the 24th, when the National Government meeting was held, Minister Wang attended and reported that Britain would have the British Minister Lampson sign in Beijing within a day or two, and the United States would have Minister Wu Chaoshu formally sign with the U.S. Secretary of State in Washington within days. On the Brazilian side, according to a telegram from Minister Dai Ensai stationed in Brazil, the Brazilian Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed great sympathy for our country's request for the abolition of consular jurisdiction and has agreed to assist. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also telegraphed the Brazilian Chargé d'affaires Surs in Ping, urging him to come to Beijing to sign the agreement as soon as possible. On the French side, the French minister is still in contact in Beijing and it is hoped that the agreement will be signed soon. As for the signed China-Norway and China-Netherlands agreements and their attachments, they have been submitted to the National Government by Minister Wang for approval. The Dutch and Norwegian sides have also had the Dutch and Norwegian ministers send the agreements to their respective governments for approval. It is heard that the wording of the agreements is generally the same, and the content is similar to the provisions regarding legal rights in the China-Belgium Treaty of Commerce signed on November 22, 1928. The main text of the agreement stipulates that the people of this country who come to the territory of that country shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the laws and courts of that country, and states that in order for the Chinese government to remove the shackles of justice and to develop as much as possible the people of all countries who are happy to communicate with the Chinese people in order to develop their interests, the Norwegian or Dutch government, in order to enhance friendship with China, is willing to protect the people of both countries on an equal basis in the future, but the attached note stipulates that the time of implementation is that when all countries with existing consular jurisdiction recognize the renunciation, the Norwegian (or Dutch) overseas Chinese in China will also be subject to the laws and courts of China and receive equal treatment with other countries. (Special Telegram of the 24th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the Dutch and Norwegian legal rights were signed the day before yesterday with conditions attached, the Dutch minister will return to Ping next week, and the Norwegian minister Aubert left Beijing last night and arrived in Shanghai this morning. Both parties agreed that they should not publish anything before it is announced, so as not to give the British and American parties, who are continuing negotiations, and the Chinese people something to rely on or criticize. (Special Telegram of the 24th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Tonight, Wang Zhengting hosted Lampson and Johnson to exchange sentiments. Because Wu Chaoshu telegraphed that the negotiations in the United States had come to an end, and with the three meetings between Wang and Lampson, there has been great progress. Regarding the one point remaining in Shanghai, the Chinese side must avoid the term "reserved area", and it seems to have been changed to another method, which is related to the two attachments that have not yet been published from the last recovery of the public concessions. The legal rights between China and Britain can be considered to have come to an end in fact today. It is not known whether it will be signed just like this. What remains is only France. If the legal rights of Britain, the United States, and France are signed, France should be able to proceed smoothly. (Special Telegram of the 24th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The legal rights issue has a momentum of being easily solved. China and the Netherlands have signed, the main points of which are: (1) All clauses of consular jurisdiction enjoyed by the two countries in China are immediately abolished. (2) The people of the contracting countries shall be subject to the laws and courts of the country in which they are located. (Telegram from the Central News Agency on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) On the Brazilian side, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a telegram from Dai Ensai stating that the Brazilian government also expressed its agreement. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has telegraphed the Brazilian Minister to come south from Ping as soon as possible to negotiate and schedule a signing date. (Telegram from the Central News Agency on the 24th)</p>
<p>Nanjing It is certain that China and Britain have come close. British Minister Lampson told people on the 24th that he was very happy about the conclusion of the legal rights between China and the Netherlands. When the British reply arrives, he will visit Minister Wang to continue discussions in order to resolve the issue. (Telegram from the Central News Agency on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Dutch Minister is scheduled to leave Beijing on the 26th. (Telegram from the Central News Agency on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Dutch Minister Oudendijk received instructions from the government, accepting our request to abolish consular jurisdiction, and was given full power to sign. At 8:00 PM on the 23rd, he and Minister Wang formally signed the agreement at the diplomatic residence. After the signing, they drank champagne and shook hands to pay their respects. Oudendijk has telegraphed the government, requesting that the agreement be announced simultaneously in the two capitals. (Telegram from the Central News Agency on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) More than 80 representatives of the Beijing Municipal Chamber of Commerce petitioned the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 24th to abolish consular jurisdiction with resolute measures before the National Assembly. (Telegram from the Central News Agency on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Zhengting told people on the evening of the 24th that regarding the issue of legal rights between China and Britain, the British Minister has not yet received a reply from his government, and the French side is currently in contact. On the Brazilian side, the Brazilian Minister has been telegraphed to come to Beijing, but no reply telegram has been received. Wang hosted the British and American ministers and the British and American consuls on the evening of the 24th, with Wang Chonghui, Liu Ruiheng, Chen Shaokuan, and others accompanying them. Because it was a social occasion, legal rights were not discussed. (Special Telegram of the 24th)</p>

<h3>Aviation Conference</h3>
<p>Passes General Assembly Declaration</p>
<p>Three Aviators Arrive in Beijing</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Aviation Conference passed the General Assembly Declaration this afternoon, which will be released after the closing on the 25th. The content of the declaration first describes the rapid advancement of aviation industries in various countries after the European War due to needs. France currently has 4,500 aircraft and 40,000 air force personnel. The United States has increased civil aviation to 4,000 aircraft and more than 5,000 airports in five years, with a total investment of 700 million. The aviation budget of the United Kingdom last year was 20 million pounds. Our country has been operating aviation for 20 years, but all equipment is relatively simple, and the ability to defend oneself in the air is very weak. Economic and transportation industries are difficult to compete in. It is very important to our international status. Therefore, the only responsibility of this conference is to seek the development of aviation. The most important things at present are: 1. Expand the Air Force, 2. Aviation Equipment, 3. Unify Aviation Administration, 4. Cultivate Aviation Talents, 5. Expand Aviation Manufacturing Industry, 6. Ground Equipment, 7. Promote Civil Aviation, 8. Ensure Aviation Safety, 9. Increase Aviation Funding. It is hoped that the whole country will work together to achieve these goals. (Special Telegram of the 24th)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Recent Revolutionary Views in Various Countries</h3>
<p>Since the recent revolutionary trends in South and Central America and Southern Europe, those in various countries around the world who are dissatisfied with their governments often witness the outbreak of revolutions, some successful and some unsuccessful. For example, the recent revolution in Spain was successful. The recent revolutions in Portugal and Honduras were unsuccessful. The Portuguese government forces presented the revolutionary forces on Madeira Island with surrender terms, but the government did not allow it. The government marines can invade the island at any time. The Honduran government forces gradually suppressed the rebellion in less than a week, winning all battles on the various fronts. It is claimed that the areas can be completely restored within a few days. Therefore, the future of the revolutions in Portugal and Honduras is unknown, but this time they have completely failed.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, whether a revolution succeeds or fails depends on whether the timing is right, but there are also general reasons. What are these general reasons? That is, the so-called government is too ill-suited to the national conditions of the time and is disliked by the majority of the people in the country. Then its revolution will surely succeed. Conversely, if the government has not yet reached the point of being abandoned by the majority of the people in the country, and a small number of people disagree with the government and want to use a kind of power in their hands to attempt a revolution, then unless it encounters a particularly favorable opportunity, success is rare. Because if the government is not abandoned by all, its use of various powers is ultimately superior to that of the revolutionaries.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Communications</h3>
<p>Issues Regarding the Ordering of Stamps with British Merchants</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, the Ministry of Finance Printing Bureau in Baizhifang, Beiping, stated that when Lin Shizai of the Ministry of Communications was the Director of Postal Affairs, he signed a contract with a British printing company to print stamps, which caused the loss of rights and interests and huge losses. They issued a declaration of opposition. The reasons for the Ministry of Communications signing this contract with the British printing company, as well as the printing period, the number of stamps, and the total amount of losses, are thought to be of general concern. The reporter of this agency interviewed a person in the transportation industry yesterday to inquire. According to him, in the third year of the Republic of China, the General Post Office of the Ministry of Communications signed a contract with the Ministry of Finance Printing Bureau in Baizhifang, Beiping, for the printing of stamps. All the stamp patterns required by the Chinese post office, such as sailboats, farming, and bridges, were contracted to the bureau for printing. Although the printing period and the prohibition of contracting to third parties were not specified, the Chinese post office had never before had foreign merchants print stamps. Since the end of the military affairs and national unification, the Ministry of Communications Postal Service Command and the Ministry of Finance Printing Bureau engraved a portrait template of Chiang Kai-shek to produce unified commemorative tickets. The bureau was not very satisfied because the engraving was not very similar to the original image. Later, the department decided that the various Chinese stamps in the past were all old-fashioned and decided to reprint a kind of image of the late Premier, and twelve kinds of new stamps such as the late martyrs, to be printed in the future, and abolish the old tickets of the past after six months. It once ordered the Baizhifang Printing Bureau to engrave the Premier's template, but it was not good after repeated engravings. During his term, Lin Shizai signed a contract with the British Donalla Printing Bureau in March last year to have the bureau engrave the Premier's and twelve other martyrs' stamp templates. The Premier's stamp was scheduled to be printed for five years, with a quantity of 150 million stamps (that is, about 300 million stamps printed each year). The printing price is US$164.95 per 10,000 stamps. At that time, one US dollar was equivalent to 2.8 yuan of national currency. This ticket price includes printing paper. It is found that the printing price of the Baizhifang Printing Bureau is 110 yuan in national currency per 10,000 stamps, but paper is not included. However, today one US dollar is equivalent to more than 4 yuan in national currency. If it is verified, the price difference with the national printing price will be extremely large. The Ministry of Communications signed a contract with the British side because of the template problem. If the British company only engraves the template for our country, but does not print the tickets, it is practically difficult to reach an agreement. Therefore, it was decided to print the Premier's stamp together with the company. As for the twelve types of templates for the martyrs, they have been sent to China and will be handed over to the Ministry of Finance Printing Bureau for printing. The British side will print a part of the Premier's stamps before September of this year and send them to China. After six months, the old-style sailboat farming bridge tickets will be abolished. How much loss will our country suffer if the British side undertakes to print the Premier's stamps for five years? Outsiders cannot calculate it.</p>
<h3>Bandits in Baodugang Attempt to Flee South Without Success</h3>
<p>Han Offers Reward, Captures Bandit Leader, Rewards 5,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Since the general attack by various armies on the bandits in Baodugang on the 18th, many have been killed. Seeing that the bandits could not support it, they attempted to flee south to the Zaozhuang area. On the afternoon of the 20th, Han ordered the armies to make the second step of pursuing and suppressing, with Gu Liangmin of the 22nd Division commanding everything.

<h3>Shanxi Merchants and Citizens' Anti-Donation Movement</h3>
<p>Oppose the Levying of Grain and Forage Donations</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: The people of Shanxi are resisting the military authorities' levying of large amounts of grain and forage donations in the name of the Jin-Cha-Sui General Headquarters. This matter has now attracted the attention of the entire society. Judging from the recent situation, this issue will become increasingly larger. The situations of all parties are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>The Rise of the Abolish Likin Propaganda Association: Since the issuance of the order to levy grain and forage donations, the Shanxi Abolish Likin Propaganda Association immediately convened an emergency meeting and resolved to resist to the death. At 10:00 a.m. yesterday, the association held its fifth general meeting and resolved (1) to telegraph the county governments, stating that they should not follow the illegal Jin-Cha-Sui General Headquarters' order to levy grain and forage donations and extort the people again, and those who have already been levied should be returned in full; (2) to send another letter to the provincial government, requesting that they quickly find a way to stop the levying of grain and forage donations; (3) to refute the Jin-Sui Garrison General Headquarters' statement that the Jin-Cha-Sui General Headquarters has been canceled and that all the grain and forage requisitions were jointly issued by Shang, Xu, and Yang; (4) to send separate letters to question Shang, Xu, and Yang about their qualifications to jointly issue grain and forage donations; (5) to send a letter to the Education Department, ordering schools to send students to various streets to give speeches and post slogans; (6) to send a letter to the schools, organizing speech teams to go to various streets to give speeches. At 9:00 a.m. today, the association gathered street chiefs and deputy chiefs and representatives of merchants in the city in the Taiyuan City Chamber of Commerce to hold a citizens' representative meeting. More than 300 street chiefs and deputy chiefs and representatives of merchants attended, and various levels of party departments and organizations also sent representatives. After the meeting, Liang Xueting, a member of the Abolish Likin Association, took the stage to report on the military authorities' levying of donations with illegal orders and the current suffering of the people of Shanxi, hoping that all merchants and citizens in the city would unanimously resist and never pay. After Liang finished his report, representatives of the city party department and chamber of commerce all gave speeches. The atmosphere at the meeting was very激昂, and everyone unanimously expressed their opposition to the end.</p>
<p>Statement from the General Headquarters Closure Office: Since the start of the anti-donation movement, although the officials have tried to maintain calmness, they also feel uneasy. The General Headquarters Closure Office posted a notice in various newspapers, stating that the Jin-Cha-Sui General Headquarters has been canceled and that all the grain and forage requisitions were jointly issued by Shang, Xu, and Yang, fearing that all sectors would not understand the truth and misunderstandings would occur, so they made a special announcement in the newspaper. It is reported that Shang (Zhen), Xu (Yongchang), and Yang (Aiyuan) once expressed to others that this levy of grain and forage donations was ordered by Deputy Commander Zhang of the Northeast. They have now telegraphed the situation of the people's anti-donation to Deputy Commander Zhang and requested instructions.</p>
<p>Various Counties and Cities Also Responded: After the General Headquarters Closure Office issued the notice, the people's sentiments became more激昂. Everyone believes that this kind of grain and forage donation has now been levied in a small number of counties and the Taiyuan City merchant households. The levied documents clearly stated that it was ordered by the Jin-Cha-Sui General Headquarters. Now the General Headquarters Closure Office suddenly pushes the responsibility for the donation completely on Shang Zhen, Xu Yongchang, and Yang Aiyuan, and Shang, Xu, and Yang said that because of the lack of military expenses, they telegraphed Deputy Commander Zhang and asked for instructions, and Zhang replied by telegram, ordering the levy of grain and forage donations, not out of their own free will, in order to shirk responsibility. In short, the purpose of the people is not to pay illegal donations. Since the officials do not automatically cancel the donation, the people can only rise up and resist, always aiming to achieve the goal. Currently, the anti-donation movement conferences in various counties and cities have been established one after another. Various people's organizations in Taiyuan City have issued many anti-donation declaration leaflets yesterday and today. It is expected that if the authorities do not actually cancel it, the trend will likely expand day by day (17th).</p>
<h3>Measures to Maintain Amidst the Chaos and Depreciation of Harbin Currency</h3>
<p>Banks Issue More Paper Money and Run Side Businesses</p>
<p>Government Orders the Implementation of Stabilization of Exchange Rates</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: After the Harbin currency was increased by 21 million, the original intention was to use it to buy local products and set up institutions to take charge of it. Unexpectedly, less than one-tenth of the issued currency circulated in Harbin City. Where was most of it? Until ten days ago, it was still unknown. Recently, it was clarified by various groups that the newly increased banknotes were all used by various banks to run side businesses, buying local products in remote cities and towns in order to make profits, which caused Harbin City to not benefit from the increased banknotes, but suffered the harm of currency depreciation first. For two weeks, the price of Harbin currency has been depreciating against gold currency. Even for spot exchange to Tianjin and Shanghai, every 100 yuan of exchange rate is above 24 or 25 yuan. The administrative chief office of the Supervisory Office is worried that the currency price will depreciate daily and people's livelihood will be difficult, so it convened various banks on the 17th of this month to discuss the method of maintaining it and strongly advised various banks to maintain the method of 20 yuan of Harbin currency for every 100 yuan of silver. In addition, the banks were ordered to properly formulate a maintenance strategy and submit it to the office for approval and implementation. The Bankers Association submitted a method yesterday, which has been approved by the Chief Administrative Office. The general idea is (1) The exchange rate in Tianjin and Shanghai is fully exchanged at 24 yuan per 100 yuan; (2) Sell ​​Japanese gold in the market to stabilize the exchange rate; (3) All remittances to the Association, regardless of business or individual, and regardless of the amount, are accepted without issuing receipts; (4) Except for the remittances directly made by the Association, those remote provinces such as Zhili and Shandong, where various banks cannot exchange, entrust Yongheng Official Bank to entrust Yonghengmao and Yonghengde to exchange on their behalf. Liaoning Province entrusts the Three Northeast Provinces Official Bank and Bianye Bank to remit. Southern provinces entrust the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications to remit. Heihe Manchuria and other places entrust the Heilongjiang Official Bank to remit. However, the Bankers Association, with the government's ban, the exchange rate is lower than the market, and more remittances are received, so it suffers more losses, so the daily business hours are specially shortened, and the remittance procedures are also particularly cumbersome. Merchants find it inconvenient to remit money, and because various banks have increased the issuance of Harbin currency and engaged in side businesses privately, they have jointly filed a complaint with the Chief Administrative Office by chambers of commerce and other groups. The office has not yet approved it (19th).</p>
<h3>Wuhu Express</h3>
<p>Wuhu is separated from Wuwei, Pijiang and Fanchang by a river, and bandits often harass it from time to time. Recently, a bandit gang has emerged, and there are many rumors in the local area. In addition to declaring martial law and deploying defenses in the four cities, the county magistrate specially came to Wuhu a few days ago to ask the 171st Brigade Command of the 57th Division to send troops to increase defenses. Yesterday, Brigade Commander Wang sent Sun Shiwen, the first company commander of the 341st Regiment, to lead his troops to guard and search and suppress as appropriate.</p>
<p>The bandits in Guichi were attacked by the Zhang Battalion of the 57th Division. Recently, the battalion joined the county police in the Huangshi area to search and suppress the bandit dens in Yangpeng Mountain and Zhengjia Mountain, dispersing the bandits, killing more than 20 people, and capturing 4 people. Two police officers were killed each. The provincial government has now strictly ordered the clearing.</p>
<p>Huang Heqian, Director of the Propaganda Department of the 46th Division of the Army of the Second Bandit Suppression and Preparation Office of the General Headquarters, and Xiangyang, Wu Zixian, and other officers and soldiers, about a hundred people, arrived in Wuhu from Hankou via Anqing last night, stayed at the Zhonghua Hotel, and posted a large number of anti-communist slogans, and decided to transfer to Hefei, Lu'an and other places for work tomorrow.</p>

<p>Death of a Key Suspect in the Liyang Tax Evasion Case　The Zhenjiang District Court rendered its verdict on February 4th of this year in the case of the Liyang former County Magistrate Zheng Chengyuan and Finance Bureau Chief Pan Bin, et al., for corruption in land tax. Pan Bin, as one of the key suspects in the case, was sentenced to life imprisonment, deprivation of civil rights for life, and confiscation of property for jointly engaging in corruption and embezzling over one thousand yuan from the treasury. After the sentencing, Pan and other defendants in the case immediately filed an appeal with the High Court. Subsequently, the Zhenjiang District Court transferred Pan et al. to Suzhou on February 18th, detaining them in the Third Sub-Prison on Siqian Street pending trial. The date for the court hearing had not yet been set. Unexpectedly, due to his advanced age and inability to endure the hardships of imprisonment, Pan contracted typhoid fever in prison two weeks ago. Despite the treatment by the prison physician Ruan Jiemin, it proved ineffective. His condition worsened severely until the day before yesterday, prompting Pan to personally send a letter to his Shanghai residence in Bentang Alley, ordering his son to come to Suzhou to care for him. Yesterday (the 24th), his eldest son, Zhijian, arrived in Suzhou to visit him in prison. Upon this, the prison warden, Ding Lei, presented a request to the High Court for temporary release on bail, which was approved. At 11:00 AM, he was sent to Boxi Hospital for treatment. However, he unexpectedly passed away in the hospital after 12:00 PM. The case was reported to the District Court, which dispatched Prosecutor Lu Yihou to conduct an examination in the afternoon, confirming that he had died of illness. Orders were given for the body to be prepared for burial.</p>

<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Various Businesses Jointly Request Postponement of Business Tax Collection　The Jiangsu Province Business Tax has been ordered by the provincial government to be collected simultaneously in all counties starting April 1st. Business associations in various counties, considering that the business tax rates set by Jiangsu Province are currently being submitted to the central government for reduction, and with the provincial government already ordering its implementation, have been convening meetings of merchants from various industries to discuss how to pay the tax. When the Wuxi County Business Association convened a meeting on the 21st, after serious discussion by various industries, it was generally agreed that the recent central political conference had resolved on the general principles for provinces to collect business tax, with key points being not to disturb the people and not to hinder commercial development. It was decided to have the Legislative Yuan formulate a business tax law. Before the law is enacted and promulgated, provinces that have already implemented the business tax should temporarily follow the methods approved by the Ministry of Finance. However, the business tax rate set by Jiangsu Province has the suspicion of being harsh and disturbing to the people. The key items are roughly divided into the following points: (1) After the central government abolished the likin tax, it has separately implemented consolidated taxes on various important goods, with tax rates mostly using percentages, which are higher than the previous likin tax. The nature of the business tax is a type of behavior tax, and collecting business tax in addition to the consolidated tax is a type of double taxation. The tax rate should be reduced as much as possible. Therefore, the 1928 general principles set by the Ministry of Finance stipulated that the tax should be calculated and collected using the per mille method, and should not exceed two per mille at most. However, the tax rate set by Jiangsu Province includes those collecting ten per mille and twenty per mille, which merchants cannot bear. (2) Although the Jiangsu Province Business Tax Regulations have been revised by the Ministry of Finance, items such as those in Article 4 have the suspicion of taxing goods. (3) The original general principles stated that luxury businesses and others containing a nature that should be banned are not subject to these limits. The Ministry of Finance's supplementary measures also stipulate that various businesses, regardless of domestic or foreign goods, should be taxed at the same rate. However, Jiangsu Province has made exceptions for luxury businesses, which is obviously beyond the scope of the standard. (4) Various items in Article 10 of the original text regarding overdue fines are harsh and disturbing to the people, and the rewards for reporting encourage local accusations. If implemented, merchants will not be able to operate in peace, let alone develop. (5) Shanghai has not yet implemented measures. If Jiangsu Province implements it immediately, it will affect the prosperity of inland commerce and further strangle merchants. (6) Business certificates are similar in nature to the busy Cao version series, so no fees are charged. How can they be forced to affix stamps? Based on the above points, yesterday, 33 guilds including the Qian industry and representatives from 35 industries including Zifang jointly telegraphed the Central Political Conference, Legislative Yuan, Executive Yuan, Ministry of Industry, Ministry of Finance, Jiangsu Provincial Government, and Department of Finance, requesting that the Jiangsu Province Business Tax be temporarily postponed until the central business tax law is promulgated and Shanghai has measures, so as to avoid harshness and stabilize commerce.</p>
<p>Confession of Bandits Obtained on Train　The train between Beijing and Wuxi, which departed from Beijing to Wuxi the day before yesterday, had a gun-wielding bandit killed by the onboard police inspector Zhang Hong, who coordinated with the military police, inside the train. Three others were captured on the spot and handed over to the Wuxi Garrison Command. The chief adjutant Wang Maoling interrogated them the night before last. The bandits' confessions differed slightly from what was said on the train. (1) The deceased was named Zhang Jianxun. (2) The bandit gang consisted of six people, carrying four handguns. In addition to the two guns of the deceased Zhang Jianxun and Zhang Er, there were two more carried by the fugitives Liang Zhaoxian and another bandit. (3) The plan to rob a certain family in Longtan was initiated by the fugitive Liang Zhaoxian. (5) The firearms were provided by someone. (5) Chen Renkui is indeed a suspect. After Chief Adjutant Wang clarified the above points, he prepared to send them to Beijing for verification in the coming days.</p>
<p>Teenager in Shitangwan Commits Suicide by Poisoning　At around 1:00 PM on the 22nd, a young traveler arrived at the Meiyuan Taihu Hotel in Kaiyuan Township, this county. He booked room number 6 upstairs and registered himself as Sun Shihhan (i.e., Sun Rong), age 21, from Shitangwan, currently a student at the Wusong Merchant Marine School in Shanghai. On the 23rd, Sun toured all the scenic spots in the garden (i.e., Meiyuan). He went to bed at around 10:00 PM that evening. The next morning, at around 11:00 AM, the hotel tea server noticed that the guest had not yet gotten up, so he knocked on the door and called out to him. After a long time without a response, he became suspicious and reported it to the manager, Wu Weixiong, who opened the door and saw Sun Shihhan lying supine on the bed, his face pale and snoring continuously, indicating that he had taken poison. In the drawer of the dressing table, two empty bottles of "Madina" sedative pills sold by Xiangheng foreign firm and one empty bottle of "Sleeping Pills" sold by Chinese and Western pharmacies were found, along with a suicide note. He immediately reported to the Ninth Public Security Bureau in charge to investigate. Sun Shihhan, who had taken poison, was carried to the Brothers Hospital for treatment. Dr. Zhu tried his best to rescue him, but the poisoning was too deep, and his life was in great danger. The reason for the traveler's suicide is unknown, but according to his friends, it was likely due to "lost love" and a severe emotional shock.</p>

They had not yet married. Her fiancé worked at the Shen Taixing Tea Shop on Dongda Street in Pinghu and often communicated by letter. The wedding was scheduled for December of this year. Due to disputes over the betrothal gifts, the groom's family was very dissatisfied. Bing Sheng criticized her in a letter, which contained slander against the fifth daughter.

<p>Harsh Collection by Tobacco and Alcohol Revenue Office Arouses Public Outrage　The Zhenjiang Tobacco and Alcohol Monopoly Revenue Office previously collected both production and sales taxes according to the regulations set by the Ministry of Finance. There was no provision for taxing raw tobacco made into finished goods. Now, since Director Yao took over, he has been unusually demanding. He suddenly audits the accounts and checks the goods of various tobacco shops, as well as various illegal acts. He also abuses many people, concocts various names, and conducts covert investigations, bordering on extortion. The day before yesterday, Jitae and Tobacco Shop transported two items of finished tobacco, which were seized by the revenue officer as unreported smuggled goods. When Guo, the shop's director, went to collect the receipt, he was slandered and sent to the Fourth Public Security Bureau for detention. The entire tobacco industry was aroused to public outrage.

Over 30 schools and over 500 male and female athletes participated, and the stands were packed with spectators, making it a grand occasion. The entire group first paraded around the field, followed by the opening ceremony, and then the sports began. Six men's and women's finals were held. In the women's long jump, Ms. Zhang Pingxian of Dongya set a new national record with 4.30 meters. Today is the second day, and even better results are expected.</p>
<h3>Opening Ceremony</h3>
<p>After the parade, the male and female athletes from each school stood in a single line facing the podium. Amidst the music of the military band, the solemn and grand unprecedented event slowly began, and the ceremony was held in the following order: (1) Everyone stands at attention; (2) Music is played; (3) The Party Song is sung; (4) The national flag and the portrait of the Premier are given the highest respect; (5) Chairman Xu Peihuang respectfully reads the Premier's will; (6) Silence; (7) Chairman Xu Peihuang reports; (8) Representative Yu Hongjun, the President of the Association, delivers a speech; (9) Tong Xingbai, the representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, delivers a speech; (10) Honorary Instructor Chu Fuchen delivers a speech; (11) Guest Zhu Yingpeng delivers a speech; (12) Ceremony concludes.</p>
<p>Chairman Xu Peihuang's Report　He briefly stated that today is the first time that the city is holding a joint middle school sports meet. The main purpose is to popularize physical education in middle schools and to test the level of physical education in middle schools. The number of athletes participating this time is 519, including 328 in the men's A group, 98 in the men's B group, and 93 women. The nature of each school includes two provincial schools, two national schools, five municipal schools, three private university-affiliated middle schools, and eighteen private university-affiliated middle schools that have not been registered, which can be divided into (1) public and private registered schools; (2) middle schools that have not been registered but have completed registration procedures. Finally, he thanked the China National Amateur Athletic Federation for providing the venue, and the support of various bureaus and sports experts, as well as the Upper Middle and Dongya Boy Scouts for maintaining order.</p>
<p>President Zhang Yuejun's Speech　Mayor Zhang's representative, Yu Hongjun, briefly stated that he was ordered by the mayor to attend the grand opening ceremony of the first joint middle school sports meet. The public and private male and female students participating this time will use their skills developed through daily training to show their abilities. Strong physiques developed on this day will be used for serving society and the country in the future. Promoting sports can (1) cultivate a spirit of self-discipline; (2) cultivate a sense of discipline; (3) compete fairly through legitimate means. He hopes that all athletes will develop their individual sports and sporting virtues and advance with each year.</p>
<p>Party Headquarters Tong Xingbai's Speech　He briefly stated that physical education is related to the future of each individual, as well as the survival of society and the country. While exploring intellectual and moral education, we must not forget to study physical education. Physical education is the foundation of the three educations. Mr. Sun Yat-sen's greatest expectation is the development of the spirit of the Chinese nation, starting with morality, and physical education occupies the center of morality. There are two essential meanings to studying physical education: (1) permanent self-cultivation; (2) universal development.</p>
<p>Honorary Instructor Chu Fuchen's Speech　Mr. Chu briefly stated that people call our country an old and sick man, which is painful to think about. If each individual can pay attention to physical education, they can create a promising country of youth. He himself has been sick since middle age, but even now that he is nearly sixty years old, he does not feel old, because of the effect of exercising for one hour every morning for decades. If individuals do this, and all the people in the country can follow suit, then our country will be healthy for everyone.</p>
<p>Guest Zhu Yingpeng's Speech　Mr. Zhu briefly stated that when we stand shoulder to shoulder with Westerners, there is a clear difference in height and strength. The reason why Westerners are strong is because they have been constantly training for thousands of years, which has allowed them to maintain the physique of their original ethnic group. People in our country have placed physical education outside of all things in life. This kind of misconception has created a nation that is small and weak today. Now we must strive for progress so that we can be as strong and healthy as the tall and large Western nations.</p>

<h3>Outstanding Achievements</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were seven preliminary events for men and women, three final events for Men's Group A, two final events for Men's Group B, and one final event for Women. The results were excellent. In particular, Chen Xingpei of Pudong achieved 4 minutes and 39.8 seconds in the 1500 meters, and Qu Junyuan of Wusong Aquatic Products achieved 5.82 meters in the long jump. These results are rare for middle school students. Furthermore, the top three in the women's long jump all broke the National Games record, which is especially noteworthy.</p>
<p>Women's Long Jump Breaks National Record</p>
<p>The women's long jump final was an outstanding achievement of yesterday's meet. The first place, Zhang Pingxian, and the second place, Qian Hangsu, both broke Wu Meixian's record of 4 meters in the National Games. The third place, Chen Yunqing's 4 meters, equaled Wu Meixian's 4 meters. The fifth place was Yang Zhiren of Southeast, with a score equal to the fourth place, both being 3.96 meters. However, due to the new rule of no ties, another final was held, and Yang failed. Xia Fenlu scored 4.01 meters, which can be said to be fortunate and unfortunate. Yesterday's women's long jump results were particularly good. It is a pity that the sky was already darkening at the time, making running and jumping difficult; otherwise, the results would have been even better. There were twenty participants in the competition.</p>
<p>Women's 50-meter Also Sets New Record</p>
<p>In the women's 50-meter preliminary, the first place in the third group, Zhang Pingxian of East Asia, achieved 7.3 seconds, which is also equal to the new national record. Sun Guiyun's national record for 50 meters is 7.3 seconds, and Cao Hanhua's record in Malaya is 7.3 seconds. However, Wu Meixian of Harbin achieved a score of 7 seconds in the Northeast Four Provinces Joint Sports Meet.</p>
<p>1500-meter Celebrated Athlete Wins Title</p>
<p>In the 1500-meter final, fifty-six people started. With the sound of the gun, everyone sprinted forward. The track was crowded and chaotic, a magnificent scene. After one lap, the celebrated athlete Chen Xingpei chased quickly and led the pack, his demeanor very relaxed. Qiu Lingru followed him, about ten yards behind. After the second and third laps, Chen still remained in the lead, but he did not fall behind either. The rest of the competitors followed one after another, trailing by about half a lap. In the last lap, everyone strove forward. Chen Xingpei was always in the lead, and he finally won the championship with a time of 4 minutes and 39.8 seconds. The result was especially remarkable, not only rare in middle schools but also rarely seen in universities. The second place, Qiu Lingru, was still about ten yards behind.</p>

<h3>Urgent Telegram from the Municipal Executive Committee</h3>
<p>Abolish All Unequal Treaties</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Executive Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party issued a telegram yesterday, stating, "To all provincial and municipal party headquarters, all special party headquarters, all general branches, all national newspapers, and all legal entities across the country: The essential element for the establishment of a nation lies first in the complete sovereignty, and the freedom of national development requires the advocacy of independence. Today, the imperialists, through unequal treaties, infringe upon our sovereignty, obstruct our advocacy, oppress us at will for eighty years, and also harbor bandits, hinder our security, and provide aid and weapons to prolong our Red disaster. Their desire to keep our nation in a perpetual state of danger and our people in a state of weakness is evident. Now, the new Chinese people are not asleep or dreaming; how can we willingly bow our heads and endure the trampling of the imperialists? Recalling the pretexts for the imperialists to conclude and extend unequal treaties, they say that our national construction is young and our legal system is flawed, or that we lack a strong government and unified power. But now our new government is increasingly on the right track, unification has long been achieved, construction is advancing rapidly, and the legal system is fully prepared. The imperialists should have automatically abolished all unequal treaties in good faith to strengthen friendly relations. However, not only do they not plan to do so to fulfill their previous promises, but even when we repeatedly urge them to negotiate, they still use cunning words and sophistry, hesitating and watching. In short, the imperialists believe that repeated wrongs make a right, that the guest can usurp the role of the host, and they still hope to continue their political aggression and extend their economic oppression, maintaining the superior position produced by their superhuman ideology before the Great War. At this time when the imperialists are deeply mired in the illusion of power, if we want to demand the abolition of all unequal treaties in good faith through a friendly and consultative attitude, it is no different from asking a tiger for its skin. We deeply hope that our diplomatic authorities will quickly change their negotiation strategy and resolutely resume revolutionary methods, to avoid being chronically anesthetized by them. Looking at Japan at the end of the last century and the recent examples of Turkey and Siam, all relied on their rationality to strengthen themselves and abolish all unequal treaties. How are we, the new Chinese people, inferior to them, that we cannot automatically abolish them? As the National Assembly is about to open, all our people should unanimously demand that an announcement be made to the outside world to abolish all unequal treaties. Moreover, even on his deathbed, our party leader repeatedly exhorted us to abolish all unequal treaties. We believe that the representatives of the National Assembly have his words still ringing in their ears and will surely follow his instructions. The entire nation will resolutely support them, so that our party's foreign policy can be implemented and the proposals of the National Assembly can be realized. If obstacles arise, the whole country will not hesitate to sever economic ties with them, because we will never tolerate others snoring beside our bed for the sake of our supreme and complete sovereignty. We respectfully announce this, hoping that comrades and compatriots in all regions will rise up and make the same demands, so as to achieve the final goal. It is the fortune of the party and the nation, and the fortune of the Chinese people."</p>

<h3>Antipathy Towards American Flour Shipments</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Flour Millers Association Sends Telegrams to the Ministries of Finance and Industry</p>
<p>The Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Inland Mechanized Flour Millers Association sent telegrams yesterday to Song Ziwen, Minister of Finance of the National Government, and Kong Xiangxi, Minister of Industry, stating: "We have read in recent Chinese and foreign newspapers that the United States plans to ship surplus flour to China, valued at 20 million yuan, as a form of loan. The government authorities are investigating the actual needs of our country before making a decision. This has caused anxiety among agricultural, commercial, and industrial circles. Last year's harvest was abundant, and the amount of rice and wheat stored in various provinces is still plentiful. The flour produced by various factories this year is already suffering from sluggish sales and huge inventories. Even with low-priced sales, no one is interested. At present, there is no need to import foreign flour. If this becomes a reality, the impact on the rural economy will be immeasurable. The sudden import of large quantities of foreign flour will inevitably exacerbate the problem of surplus domestic flour. Various flour mills will be forced to shut down, which will have a great impact on the livelihoods of workers and the nation's established flour industry. In the past, there was a proposal to ship Japanese rice to our country for low-priced sales, but it was ultimately prevented by bans and public opposition. The American flour situation is the same, so why should we treat one more favorably than the other, leaving a bad reputation? It would be of no benefit to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and the harm would be great for industry and commerce. We respectfully request that you accept this proposal and quickly eliminate this idea to protect commerce, agriculture, and workers. This would be a great service. The Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Inland Mechanized Flour Millers Association."</p>
<h3>Publication of the Feetham Report</h3>
<p>The Full Text is Divided into Seven Sections</p>
<p>Three Sections Published Today</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement hired Judge Feetham of South Africa as an expert advisor in January of last year to assist the Council in planning construction projects, taking full account of the wishes of the Chinese people and providing reasonable and full protection for the great commercial interests that have already developed in Shanghai. Mr. Feetham spent more than a year in Shanghai conducting investigations and research, and produced a report in seven sections. The content of the first section is an introduction, explaining that his duties are not limited to studying the economic, social, administrative, and political situation of the Shanghai International Settlement and its adjacent areas, but also include the general economic, political, and administrative background of the country, because Shanghai's special problems are closely related to China's general situation. The second section describes the history and conditions of the International Settlement and its governance, stating that the current level of development of various institutions in the International Settlement is the result of gradual evolution. To devise a construction plan for the future of the Settlement, it is necessary to first study the process of this evolution; otherwise, the various problems that need to be solved now cannot be clearly understood. The third section describes the business interests of Shanghai. The fourth section is a statement of findings and comments on political and administrative issues. The fifth section discusses the main issues related to the future of the International Settlement. The sixth section discusses the surface of roads outside the Settlement. The seventh section is a supplement. The sections that are being published now are the first to third sections. A summary of them is published in today's special column of this newspaper, and the remaining sections will be published successively three weeks later.</p>

<h3>National Coal Association Hopes to Maximize Coal Production</h3>
<p>Ministry of Railways Orders Beining Railway to Add Cars</p>
<p>The Chinese National Coal Production and Sales Association previously reported that due to a lack of cars on the Beining Railway, coal merchants could not ship goods in large quantities, resulting in coal shortages throughout the region. The Association sent a telegram to the Ministry of Railways requesting relief. Yesterday, the Association received Order No. 828 from the Ministry of Railways, which stated: "We have received the telegram from Yangdai. Based on the situation, please forward the order to the Beining Railway Bureau to quickly prepare more cars to transport national coal, so as to prevent foreign coal from monopolizing the market. This should be approved. Please forward the order to the Beining Railway Bureau to comply. Other matters should be reviewed by the relevant authorities."</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>Protests the Arbitrary Sino-Foreign Litigation Case</p>
<p>Regarding the French Consul's Unilateral Judgment and Detention of the Hulin Manager</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce protested yesterday to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the French Consul's unilateral ruling on the Sino-foreign litigation case of Hulin Silk Weaving Company. The telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing stated: "To His Excellency the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Nanjing: Hulin Silk Weaving Company entrusted Xue Jialai Company, a French merchant, as its exclusive agent in France. In October of last year, the merchant handled a batch of orders worth approximately 1.8 million francs, with a delivery date of the end of December. When the time came, the bills of exchange did not arrive, and the goods could not be shipped. Hulin Company was urged by various weaving factories to fulfill the orders and could only compensate for the losses and return the orders to the original factories. Hulin Company suffered a loss of more than 100,000 yuan. It then temporarily deducted a portion of the commission retained by Xue Jialai Company, amounting to more than 10,000 taels of Huayin. Xue Jialai Company then sued the French Consul, summoning the directors, supervisors, and general manager of the company. After they arrived, the French Consul interrogated them at will in his personal office. Without a formal court hearing or Chinese officials participating in the trial, the French Consul abruptly ruled to detain the manager, Wang Xingsu. According to the Sino-French Treaty of Tianjin and the established practice of the Gongxie over the years, cases involving Chinese and foreign parties should be jointly tried by Chinese officials. The French Consul's actions this time were illegal and exceeded his authority, setting a precedent since the opening of trade. We respectfully request that your ministry investigate and approve a serious protest to the French ambassador to revoke the French Consul's unilateral judgment in this case."</p>
<h3>Social Bureau Mediates Coal Industry Dispute</h3>
<p>Meeting Scheduled for the Day After Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Coal Industry Trade Association sent a letter to various coal companies yesterday regarding the coal industry dispute, stating: "Regarding a notification: We have received a notice from the Municipal Social Bureau stating, 'According to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's report, there is a dispute among the coal companies in this city due to the Kaiping Coal Sales Office's failure to settle coal purchases. Please prepare to mediate. This Bureau has scheduled a meeting at 9:00 AM on the 27th of this month to convene both parties for mediation. At that time, you must bring the contracts signed by the Xinyi Gong Coal Company and 14 other companies with Yuantai and Quantai, etc., to the Bureau for verification. This is of utmost importance.' You are hereby notified to retrieve the coal purchase contracts and nominate a responsible representative to bring the coal purchase contracts to this Association at 2:00 PM on the 26th of this month for collection and submission for verification. On the same day, we will first discuss the mediation methods at this Association. Please do not delay."</p>
<h3>German Consul Returns the Russian Consulate</h3>
<p>Statement by Mr. Li of the Assistance Association</p>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post reported that the Russian Consulate building opposite the Li Cha Hotel on Huangpu Road has been entrusted to the custody of the German Consulate General since December 23, 1927, when the Russian Consul General returned to his country, for more than three years. Now, the Soviet Russian government has taken it back from the German Consulate and officially handed it over to the Russian Assistance Association by the German Consul General Fuchs on behalf of the German Consul General on the 24th of this month. As for what purpose it will be used for after this, with the Sino-Russian conference currently underway, whether a new Consul General will be sent soon, this morning (24th) the reporter inquired of Mr. Li of the Russian Assistance Association. Mr. Li replied that he had not received any news from his country on this point. However, Mr. Li previously indicated to the reporter that the Russian Assistance Association might temporarily move in to conduct business.</p>
<h3>German Warship</h3>
<p>Emden Moves to Dock</p>
<p>Expected to Leave Shanghai Around the 28th</p>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai from Beijing, the German warship Emden was visited by members of the local press at the invitation of the ship's captain, as reported in previous newspapers. The ship was originally docked at the No. 3 pontoon in the Huangpu River. It has been learned that for the sake of convenience, starting this morning (the 25th), the ship will move to the Zhongzhan Wharf of the Hongkou China Merchants Bureau. It is said that the ship will remain in Shanghai for a few more days and is expected to leave around the 28th of this month.</p>
<h3>Financial Losses of the Dachang Crew</h3>
<p>$50 Per Person... Distribution Scheduled for Today</p>
<p>The financial losses of the crew of the Dahua Company's Dachang ship, which sank in a collision, were completely resolved yesterday. Each deceased crew member will receive a compensation of $300, and each surviving crew member will receive a compensation of $50 for financial losses. Salaries will be paid up to the end of April, and all outstanding salaries for the previous three months will also be paid at the same time. However, the company's finances are not very strong, so they temporarily negotiated with the Huaan Insurance Company to borrow $11,200. This amount will be deducted from the $50,000 insurance fee when the negotiations are completed in the future. Therefore, the Dachang Company's negotiations with the other party must first wait for the crew issues to be resolved before proceeding. Yesterday afternoon, two or thirty members of the Dachang crew, accompanied by the first officer Li Jinqian, went to the company to demand payment of their salaries. Since the funds from Huaan had not arrived, they waited until 3:50 PM before a check was issued by Chengyu Zhuang for $11,200. Because the time for drawing funds had already passed, all the crew's salaries will be paid at the company at 9:00 AM today.</p>

<h3>Customs Workers' Strike</h3>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau Orders Resumption of Work First</p>
<p>And Instructs Three Parties to Fulfill the Amended Agreement</p>

<p>Order to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce: The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau yesterday issued an order to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, saying, "In order to comply with the matter, it is found that this strike of customs workers, due to the dispute over transportation fees in the cotton cloth industry, has been going on for many days. Yesterday, this Bureau convened a final mediation, and regarding the scope of workers' delivery and the vehicle fee schedule, the representatives of the three parties agreed to amend five articles of the agreement. Only the issue of inspection fees remained unresolved because the parties insisted and repeated persuasion was ineffective. In addition to strictly ordering the customs workers to resume work first, this Bureau will also copy and distribute the records of the agreement already agreed upon and amended by the representatives of the three parties, ordering them to comply with and implement them first. As for who should be responsible for the collection and payment of the inspection fees, it is actually a matter of business responsibility. It is hereby ordered that the Association immediately investigate the usual practices and resolve the matter impartially, so as to eliminate disputes, and that the handling situation be reported for future reference."</p>

In addition to issuing separate orders, you are hereby notified, and you are hereby instructed to instruct all workers to resume work immediately and wait quietly for verification, and not to delay any further, lest you incur blame.

<h3>Strict Order from the Social Affairs Bureau</h3>
<p>Sanxin Factory to Employ Former Workers</p>
<p>No Regret for the Statement Made Before</p>
<p>More than 4,000 former workers of the Sanxin Textile Factory on Yangshupu Road petitioned the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau because the new factory owner refused to resume work. Yesterday, the Bureau strictly ordered the factory to employ them and not to go back on its word. The Bureau's instructions are recorded below.</p>
<p>Order to Rong Zongjing: The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau yesterday issued an order to Rong Zongjing, the owner of the Sanxin Yarn Factory, saying, "In order to comply with the matter, according to the report of the Cotton Textile Workers' Union of the Third Special District, when the Sanxin Yarn Factory was handed over to the new owner, the representative of the capital, Zhu Guangcheng, publicly promised in the writing room on April 9 that all workers would resume work, and the lawyer Wu Shou Gong was present to testify. Now the factory announces that it will start work on the 27th of this month, and registration will begin on the 21st. According to the report of the engineer Wu Shihuai to the labor representative, it is necessary to recruit new workers. As a result, the public is frightened and asks for relief. Based on this, it is found that when the factory was handed over to the new owner, the representative Zhu Guangcheng made a statement in advance, and should not go back on his word. Moreover, since the factory has been taken over, the former workers should be employed as soon as possible. According to the previous report, it is hereby urgently ordered that you comply with and not allow the staff to deliberately make things difficult, causing disputes. This is an important order."</p>
<p>Order to Zhu Guangcheng: The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau yesterday issued an order to Zhu Guangcheng, the representative of the capital of the Sanxin Factory, saying, "In order to comply with the matter, (omitted) it is found that when the factory was handed over to the new owner, Zhu Guangcheng, as the representative of the capital, made a responsible statement in advance. Therefore, when the factory starts work now, he should still be responsible for persuading the capital to employ the former workers as soon as possible. In addition to issuing a separate order to the new factory owner Rong Zongjing, you are hereby ordered to comply with and take responsibility for handling it quickly, so as to alleviate the difficulties of the workers. This is an important order."</p>
<h3>Chinese Electric Workers</h3>
<p>Request to Amend Treatment Conditions</p>
<p>Mediation Without Complete Results</p>
<p>The Chinese electric workers, because the conditions agreed upon in the 16th year (of the Republic) may conflict with current laws and regulations, it is necessary to amend them. After the membership meeting passed 12 articles on March 16, because they could not reach an agreement through self-negotiation, they believed that the capital had no sincerity. The situation between the two sides was quite serious in secret. The union posted slogans and ordered preparations to act in unison. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau convened a mediation committee at 1 pm yesterday to conduct mediation. Yao Xinzhi and Lu Zhonglin, representatives of the capital, Zhou Guangrong and Zhu Hanhe, representatives of the labor, and Xu Zhi, director of the Huigong section of the Social Affairs Bureau, chairman, were present. First, the chairman reported that the labor and capital sides had negotiated the amendment of conditions, but could not reach an agreement. Now, the mediation committee is convened according to law to mediate, hoping that the two sides can meet frankly and resolve the matter in the shortest possible time, so as to avoid complications. Then, the representatives of the labor and capital sides stated their reasons. After a long discussion, the first article has been substantially resolved. Because it was late, the meeting was adjourned. The capital was instructed to reply to each article in writing for research, and it was decided to continue the mediation at 1 pm on the 28th.</p>
<h3>Japanese Merchants Compete with Chinese Shipping Industry</h3>
<p>Organize the Datong Company</p>
<p>Engage in River and Sea Shipping Routes</p>
<p>Named Datong: In the past two years, the Japanese shipping industry has seen an increasing number of businesses in decline, surplus ships, and empty schedules. Several months ago, many Japanese shipowners came to China to engage in activities with our country's shipping industry, willing to lease ships to Chinese merchants, even if they changed their flags. Because no one accepted, the matter was abandoned. Recently, the Japanese shipping industry regards China as the only way to develop its business. However, it is difficult to come to Shanghai to open shipping routes due to our country's recovery of shipping rights. It is heard that the Japanese shipping merchant Tanaka is contacting Chinese merchants with his merchant ships and establishing a new shipping company in Shanghai, using the name of Chinese people to the outside world, while the sovereignty is in the hands of the Japanese. This matter has been under discussion for a long time and has already been established. It is named Datong Shipping Company. The head office is located in Shanghai, and the offices have been leased. It will open for business immediately.</p>
<p>Chinese Manager: In order to maintain its reputation with the outside world, the Japanese hired the Chinese Zhuang Sheng Biao as the manager of the shipping company, responsible for soliciting transportation business. Zhuang is a customs broker and is quite familiar with various merchant groups. He has now been hired. After the shipping route is opened and the ships arrive in Shanghai from Japan, the business will begin immediately.</p>
<p>Shipping Situation: The Japanese shipping merchant Tanaka has more than a dozen ocean-going ships, including those suitable for the Yangtze River route and the North and South Ocean routes. The route is currently being negotiated. Ships must be dispatched to the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and various coastal ports, but it has not been announced.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry and Commerce Rectifies Tea Exports</h3>
<p>Commodity Inspection Bureau has Submitted Proposed Improvement Plan</p>
<p>Tea has always been a major export commodity of our country. In recent years, foreign sales have plummeted, which is of great importance to the national economy and people's livelihood. Minister Kong of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce paid attention to this when he was the Minister of Industry and Commerce. Since the reorganization of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, he has ordered Director Zou of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry to actively plan improvement methods to seek relief. It is heard that the Bureau has already drafted a concrete plan of action. In addition to requesting the Ministry to establish a Tea Research Institute, a Tea Experiment Field, and overseas propaganda agencies, it also plans to start with inspection first, in order to eliminate the negative aspects and promote fundamental improvements. Regarding the inspection regulations, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce is currently drafting them. Generally, they can be announced around the time the new tea is on the market. The methods of cracking down on tea in various countries all take strict measures. For example, if the quality is poor, the types are mixed, the tea is smeared with paste, mixed with soil and sand, and the tea is colored with damp tea, it is not allowed to be transported for export. If our country adopts strict measures at the beginning, it may have a major impact on this year's trade. Therefore, it has recently been decided to take a compromise approach. In addition to actively cracking down on inferior tea, damp tea, and tea mixed with paste and soil, etc., other teas may be temporarily allowed to be exported after the direct export merchants state their reasons, depending on their customs and needs. As the new tea is about to be on the market, various tea-producing areas are preparing for harvesting and production. If they are not notified early, there may still be fake, substandard, and other teas transported to Shanghai. In order to prevent problems before they occur, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has also been requested to notify the competent authorities of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces to instruct the tea merchants and tea farmers in various counties and cities to pay attention to the following points: (1) Tea farmers must harvest and produce early, so that the leaf quality does not harden. (2) When harvesting and producing, the old and tender must be separated, and must not be mixed for harvesting, production, or sale. (3) When tea merchants purchase, they must not smear paste and mix with tail box ash, impurities, and other malpractices. (4) The box boards, tin cans, and other items used for packaging tea leaves must be selected from superior and strong materials, so as to avoid damage, dampness, and other malpractices during the journey, so that tea farmers and tea merchants can prepare early, so as not to feel difficult temporarily. This measure has been adopted and implemented by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.</p>
<h3>Recent Events of the Ministry of Railways</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Railways believes that theft of track spikes and other items by thieves damages railway property and endangers the lives of passengers, which is of great importance and cannot be compared with ordinary theft. Since the Criminal Law has provisions on public danger crimes in Articles 197, 198, and 199, it should be strictly followed. In addition to the Ministry's request to the Executive Yuan and the Judicial Yuan to order the courts to severely punish the criminals who steal track spikes and other crimes in accordance with the public danger crimes of the Criminal Law, the Ministry also requested the Ministry of Interior, the provincial governments, and the municipal governments to instruct the Capital Police Department and the public security bureaus to inform them, and ordered the railway administrations and management committees to publicize the provisions of the public danger crimes of the Criminal Law in simple language to the public to raise awareness and maintain railway administration.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Railways received a report from the Longhai Railway Administration stating that the goods stored at various stations are piled up like mountains and cannot be transported out. Moreover, the port is being prepared, and the line will be extended. After the winter of this year, the business will develop and it can be controlled. It is proposed to purchase six Pacific-style locomotives to run passenger cars, so as to free up other large locomotives for freight transportation on the entire line, and to purchase 200 forty-ton all-steel high-side freight cars. The Ministry of Railways has ordered the approval according to the situation. However, it is stated that there are several places in the manual that need to be slightly modified, and they have all been ordered to comply with.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Railways believes that since the Longyan Iron and Coal Mine was taken over by the Ministry in accordance with the order of the Executive Yuan, the northern military affairs have been delayed for years, and the economy is poor, making it difficult to proceed. The Ministry has many complicated affairs to supervise and manage the affairs of the roads under its jurisdiction, and it is difficult to take care of them. Now that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has been established, it is actively planning steel business, and metallurgical talents have been recruited. All the planning matters for the construction of the Longyan Iron and Steel Plant and Mine have been submitted for transfer to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for unified planning and overall planning.</p>
<h3>Wood Industry Asks for Reduction of Business Tax Rate</h3>
<p>The Chinese and Western Woodware Industry Association yesterday sent a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Shanghai Tax Rules Research Association, saying, "Dear Sir, yesterday I saw in the newspaper that the business tax rules formulated by the Municipal Finance Bureau of this city will collect 10 per mille from the Western-style wood industry and the rosewood mahogany furniture industry. After reading it, I was shocked. It is found that the business operated by our industry is purchased from the same industry in manufacturing, which is indeed a wholesale nature. Its raw materials, such as rosewood, mahogany, teak, Liu'an, Machili, etc., and its equipment, such as tonic water, paint, glass, chains, hardware, etc., are all subject to business taxes directly and indirectly. Our industry has suffered a lot of secret pain, which is already considerable. Now that it is considered a luxury item and 10 per mille is collected, how can our industry bear this heavy burden? Moreover, at a time when commerce is declining and all things are rising, and expenses are increasing day by day, it is difficult to maintain. If we are taxed at 10 per mille, we will have no hope of escaping the predicament, and we will be frightened. Only the Chamber of Commerce is the leader of commerce, and the rise and fall of business conditions are more accurate than administrative organs. We hereby send a letter to the Chamber of Commerce to check the heavy burden borne by our industry and the situation that we cannot bear it any longer. We hope that you will strongly preside over it and forward it to the Ministry of Finance of the National Government and the Shanghai Municipal Government to sympathize with the difficulties of the business and reduce the tax rate. It is appropriate to collect 2 per mille according to business, so as to relieve the heavy burden and help the business escape the predicament. We sincerely ask for your help."</p>
<h3>Investigation of the Female Corpse in the Inn</h3>
<p>The case of the male passenger Wang Desheng strangling the young woman surnamed Zhang with a Songjiang accent in the Sanjiang Inn on Beihai Road was reported in yesterday's newspaper. At that time, the police station in charge immediately sent detective Cui Jinchuan to the inn to investigate after receiving the report from the Sanjiang executive. After removing the noose from the deceased's throat, the body was checked and a note was found in the pocket, which read "Tongxing South Goods Store in Fengjing Town to Gu Along, a boatman in Jiaxing." This note may be the location of the deceased's family, or it may not be known. The detective then transported the body to the corpse inspection office on Feilun Road, and took the note back to the police station to report to the police chief to select detectives to go to Fengjing and Songjiang to search for the deceased's family and investigate the murderer. Yesterday morning, Inspector Guo was commissioned by the Special District Court to come to the office to investigate and ordered the Pushan Villa to take the body for coffin and burial, and wait for the murderer to be arrested and punished. As for why this tragedy occurred, it is not clear at this moment.</p>

He had a tabby cat and asked his neighbor to feed it, and the key was kept by the neighbor. At about 1 pm yesterday, the maid went to her neighbor to ask when her master would return to Shanghai. After sitting for a while, she said to her neighbor, "I need to wash my clothes, please take the key for use." The neighbor gave it to her without suspecting anything else. But she had not come out for a long time, and the neighbor was very surprised. So he pushed the door open and saw the maid hanging herself for some unknown reason, and she had already died. He immediately called the street patrol to come to No. 316 and sent the body to the corpse inspection office on Feilun Road, waiting for the court to examine it. The deceased was about 30 years old.</p>

<h3>Art Student's Suicide</h3>
<p>Zou Bin Attempts Suicide by Poisoning Due to Extreme Poverty and News of His Father's Death. Early Rescue May Save Him.</p>
<p>Zou Bin, a student at the Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts, attempted suicide by poisoning in his dormitory yesterday morning. He was sent to the hospital by the school authorities for treatment, and it is generally believed that he can be saved. Before taking the poison, Zou wrote more than twenty farewell letters, which he sent to teachers, friends, and a letter to the principal, which stated, "I have been in difficult circumstances for years, and recently suffered the pain of my father's death. After much thought, I have decided to end it all." There was also a final letter containing many complaints, one passage of which said, "Bin was originally a poor scholar, and with the generous assistance of teachers and friends, I was able to study at the Academy of Fine Arts. Now Bin will die before his studies are completed, wasting the cultivation of teachers and friends, and my heart is broken." The reason for Zou's suicide and his circumstances can be gleaned from the above two passages.</p>
<p>Impoverished Family　Zou Bin is 20 years old, from Quxian County, Sichuan. He is a second-year student in the Western Painting Department of the Academy of Fine Arts, Group B. He previously studied at the Sichuan Provincial Middle School. Last summer, he came to Shanghai to apply to the Academy of Fine Arts. Due to his impoverished family, Acting Principal Wang Yuanbo specially allowed him to reduce his tuition to promote his development. Zou was also very hardworking at school and was praised by teachers and friends. A few days ago, his father died of illness in his hometown. When the bad news arrived, Zou Bin looked distraught and his attitude changed drastically. The night before last, at about 10:00 PM, when the lights in the school had been turned off, Zou prepared candles himself and wrote letters alone until dawn.</p>
<p>No Response　Zou lived in dormitory number five. Yesterday morning at about 6:00 AM, Training Director Yu checked dormitory number five and saw that everyone else had gotten up, but Zou was still lying on his bed. He called his name repeatedly without response, which he found strange. He looked around at the table and saw medicine. Fortunately, he was rescued early. He hurriedly asked the school doctor to examine him, who said that he had taken poison. He was immediately sent to the hospital for treatment. It was found that he had swallowed a tranquilizing medicine. Fortunately, he was rescued early. If there are no unexpected changes in the shortest period of time, there should be no danger to his life.</p>
<p>Large Batch of Farewell Letters　Before taking the poison, Zou Bin wrote no fewer than twenty letters to bid farewell to his teachers and friends, all of which were hidden in a drawer. In his letter to Principal Wang, he wrote, "Principal Wang Yuanbo, I am grateful for your repeated special accommodations in registering and attending classes. I am incompetent and have made no progress, failing to live up to your expectations. I have been in difficult circumstances for years, and recently suffered the pain of my father's death. After much thought, I have decided to end it all. The twelve yuan for my sketching fee cannot be returned. Please give it to classmate Zhou Dechang to distribute to my creditors. After my death, do not hold a memorial service at the school, nor do you need to give me any compensation. What I now hope from you is only to supervise classmate Zhou Dechang to carry out my cremation. Classmate Zhou Dechang is always known for his integrity. I hope that because of the problem with his family's funds, you will make special accommodations and allow him to postpone paying the various fees he owes the school. My heart aches terribly, so I will end it here. Respectfully wishing you well, student Zou Bin."</p>
<h3>The Truth About Yang Da's Tragic Death</h3>
<p>Adulterer Steals Wife, Stages This Tragedy. Body Moved to a Small Ditch After Murder.</p>
<p>Yang Da, a Jiangbei man from the straw shed in the alley east of the Dongyang Silk Factory on Singapore Road in West Shanghai, was suddenly stabbed to death on the evening of the 23rd of this month (the day before yesterday). It was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that the truth of this case is a tragic murder case of an adulterer stealing a wife. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Recent Situation of the Deceased　Yang Da, a native of Yancheng, Jiangbei, was about thirty years old. He was married to a woman surnamed Mou, about twenty-four or five years old. The couple originally lived in a straw shed behind Xiaohuayuan on Changan Road in Zhabei. Yang used to work as a runner for a detective in Zhabei. Recently, he made a living pulling a rickshaw. After moving to Singapore Road the day before yesterday, he also pulled a rickshaw for a day.</p>
<p>Cause of Death　According to neighbors there, although his wife, Mou, was very ugly, she was quite promiscuous and had been having an affair with the murderer for several months, meeting secretly in hotels. Although Yang knew about it, he was no match for the situation, so he had to endure it in silence. Recently, his wife's behavior changed drastically, and she often wanted to quarrel with Yang. Yang realized the situation was wrong, so he suddenly forced his wife to move here on the 20th of this month as a temporary measure to avoid trouble. Unexpectedly, the adulterer took this poisonous hand and took his wife away, so as to satisfy his desires.</p>
<p>Course of the Murder　Chen Pan, the second landlord of the straw shed, had a cohabitant named Wang Zhenqing, who introduced Yang Da and his wife to rent a room on the 20th. They moved in immediately. The second landlord, seeing that the couple was not getting along well and often quarreled, did not even ask her wife's name, which was He. Unexpectedly, after living there for only two days, at about 11:00 PM on the 23rd of this month, while she was fast asleep, several people suddenly broke down the door and violently beat Yang Da. The second landlord, Chen Pan, was awakened by the sound and was about to shout when the six or seven murderers each held sharp knives and iron bars, frightening her into silence. Seeing this, she trembled and had to wrap herself in the quilt. After the murderers stabbed Yang to death, they dragged the body to a nearby small river ditch and fled with Yang's wife. The next morning at about 4:00 AM, the second landlord got up to check and saw blood flowing everywhere on the ground. She searched by the ditch and found Yang's body naked on the ground. She then reported it to the Sixth District Police Station.</p>
<p>Landlord's Testimony　After Director Ren received the report, he immediately sent officers to investigate the body. He found a knife wound on the temple, a bar wound on the back of the neck, and an iron bar inserted into the flesh of the left waist, about three inches long, which had not been pulled out. He then found a police whistle, three keys, a diary, six cards, a disciple's post, a promissory note, and an account book in his room. He also detained Wang Zhenqing, the introducer, at the station. After Director Ren questioned the second landlord Chen Pan, she confessed that she was 40 years old, from Yancheng, and lived in a straw shed next to the silk factory. Wang Zhenqing, her cohabitant, introduced Yang Da and his wife to rent the house on the 20th of this month, and it had only been two days. However, the man and woman had not been in harmony since entering the house. Unexpectedly, last night, she suddenly heard someone break down the door and violently beat Yang. She planned to shout, but six or seven people held sharp knives and frightened her into silence. She had to hide in the quilt. It was not until she got up at 4:00 this morning that she saw Yang's body had been thrown in the ditch, with blood flowing everywhere, which was unbearable to look at. His wife had disappeared, etc. Wang Zhenqing also confessed that he was 30 years old, from Yancheng, and lived at the same address. Yang Da previously lived in a straw shed behind Xiaohuayuan on Changan Road in Zhabei. He met him in April last year. Two days ago, he suddenly asked him to find a house, so he introduced him to rent here. He did not know the reason for his murder, etc. After Director Ren obtained the confession, he immediately prepared a document and sent it to the court for trial, as the case concerned a murder.</p>
<h3>Claimed Not to Be a Virgin After Escorting</h3>
<p>Prostitute Commits Suicide Out of Shame. Old Eighth Is Pitiful. Is the Customer's Conscience Clear?</p>
<p>Many beautiful women come from Wu, and young ladies, admiring the prosperity of Shanghai, often like to mingle in the brothels to live their romantic lives. Lao Ba, who served in the room of the prostitute Liu Yanyan at No. 321 Huile Lane, Yunnan Road, is one of them. Ba's surname is Duan, and her name is A'er. She is 37 years old, still considered a young woman. Her family is as poor as dirt, and no one taught her to read. She began to shed her coarse clothes and enter the world of silk and satin at the beginning of spring. Those who galloped through the brothels salivated at her beauty and enticed her with money, hoping to kiss her fragrant body. Since pimps love money, and Ba has been longing for love for a long time, things fell into place. After the escort, the customer suddenly refused to pay the night fee, claiming that Ba was not a virgin, leaving Ba unable to defend herself. The morning before, the customer Fan Quangen came to Ba's brothel again, and Ba had an argument with him. After Fan left, she deeply resented herself, feeling too ashamed to face anyone, and suddenly had the idea of committing suicide. She secretly took opium paste alone in the room, then lay on the bed to await death. It was not until 1:00 PM that the sisters in the same brothel entered the room to call Ba for lunch. They heard no sound. They lifted the curtain and looked closely, only to find that she had died a tragic death.</p>

<h3>Mr. Feith's Report</h3>
<p>Abstract Translation of the First to Third Compilations (I)</p>
<p>Note: This article is not a detailed summary of Mr. Feith's report. The entire report is too long, and its content cannot be fully summarized within such a small scope. The purpose of Mr. Feith's article is only to reveal the general nature of the contents of the first volume. For the sake of brevity, many important arguments in the original book must be either completely omitted or briefly described. Those who wish to see the whole picture and know its detailed contents should seek it in the full text of the report. The original text of the first volume of the report can be purchased directly from Bifa Foreign Firm and Sino-American Book Company for one yuan per copy. The Chinese translation is being translated.</p>
<p>Report: Divided into seven compilations as follows: First Compilation, Introduction; Second Compilation, History and Status of the Public Concession and its Governance; Third Compilation, Shanghai Business Interests; Fourth Compilation, Statements and Comments on Political and Administrative Issues; Fifth Compilation, Major Issues Related to the Future of the Public Concession; Sixth Compilation, Roads and Ground Outside the Concession; Seventh Compilation, Supplement. Currently, only the reports of the first to third compilations are published. The remaining compilations have not yet been submitted and will be published later.</p>
<p>Preface: A letter from Mr. Feith to the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the工部局 (Shanghai Municipal Council) on April 25, 1931, was added in abstract and published at the beginning of the report as a preface as follows: The 工部局 allowed me to fully investigate freely in accordance with my own method, and at the same time, I am grateful for the assistance given to my request. The assistance of the board of directors and the members of the board is extremely valuable. I have found the assistance of them and the assistance of a majority of people outside the bureau who have nothing to do with the affairs of the bureau to be the same. The topics I should pay attention to and the sources I should visit are entirely up to me. To make a fair and unbiased discussion of the main facts about the situation in the concession, this discussion must include the past or present that I freely determine. After the materials are collected, I am free to deal with the judgment according to my own method. The full responsibility for the content of the report is therefore borne solely by me. Only I am bound by the chapters in this volume and the volumes that will be continued, and no one else. Regarding the attitude of those who study my report, I would like to briefly state what I hope for on the left. Those who are familiar with the situation in Shanghai will not fail to recognize the difficulties and complexities of the problems that I have been entrusted to deal with. Almost half of my requests for assistance have been generously granted because of the deep sympathy for the difficulties of my position. In terms of the facts of this kind of difficulty, it may allow me to make a request to the readers, whether in Shanghai or not. I would like to ask the readers to listen patiently so that I can finish my words, and to read the report with not only patience but also an open mind. The report is published in installments. The reason has been mentioned. Readers must be particularly tolerant of this. Chinese and foreign residents within the public concession, as well as other people in China and elsewhere, have expressed patience and waited quietly for the report to be completed. I hope that they will be patient for a while and not draw conclusions about the views and suggestions in the volumes that are yet to be published based on what is described in this volume. Although what is described in this volume is regarded as an "investigation," I know that it is still far from a complete investigation. When discussing political issues related to the future, there are various facts that need to be discussed. Most of these facts will be left to be published in the fifth compilation that specializes in this issue. When preparing the report, I deeply felt that the greatest service I could hope to do for all the citizens of the public concession was to make a just study of all the problems in the intense disputes to the best of my ability. When the problem is studied justly in its true sense, there must be remarks that are not welcomed by this party or that party. Part of what is said may not be tolerated by the opinions of some foreigners, and another part of what is said may not be accepted by the opinions of some Chinese people. I would like to sincerely ask all parties concerned not to be angry about what I say. If I were to fear offending the intentions of this party or that party, I would not present the various relevant reasons that must be taken into account. I would have failed to fulfill the duties unanimously requested by the工部局, which represents all the residents of the area. My responsibility is very clear, that is, not only to avoid discussing the problems I have seen in order to make the report I have prepared acceptable to the general public, but also to leave aside the main reasons that are regarded as inappropriate from the point of view of this party or that party. As mentioned earlier, the report has to be long. I would like to specially ask the readers not to read each section separately from its context, or to only seize a certain word or sentence, because this kind of word or sentence may contain a completely unintentional offense. Please wait until you have finished reading the entire report. The first volume now published can be regarded as a complete article.</p>
<p>First Compilation: This compilation is the introduction to the report. The directors of the 工部局 unanimously invited Mr. Feith to take charge of the investigation. The origin, scope, and method of all investigations are stated in the introduction. After arriving in Shanghai, Mr. Feith soon sent a letter to the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the 工部局 on January 15, 1930, explaining the scope of his powers. This letter has also been quoted in the introduction. As far as the letter shows, the duties that the 工部局 asked Mr. Feith to take on were "to be an advisor to the 工部局 and to assist the Bureau in planning and building, to fully consider the wishes of the Chinese people, and at the same time to give reasonable and adequate protection to the great business interests gathered in Shanghai." The report mentions that, in terms of this scope of powers, the scope of the investigation is very broad, so the nature of his duties is explained as follows: Therefore, my duties are not only limited to the study of the economic, social, administrative, and political conditions of the Shanghai Public Concession and the locations adjacent to the Concession, but also to know the outline of the current situation of the environment to which Shanghai belongs, in other words, the general economic, political, and administrative background of the country, which must also be known. Shanghai's special problems must be observed from this background, and then the truth and proportion of each problem can be known. If we do not first know the general situation of China, we cannot make the proposed Shanghai governance system and the direction of national progress form a suitable relationship, nor can we plan and carry out any proposed reforms, and give the economic interests involved the necessary protection. However, this common background must always be kept in mind, and my preliminary work is of course to study Shanghai itself and, in particular, to understand the nature and scope of Shanghai's industry and commerce, so that it can be a solid foundation for the commercial center, as well as the characteristics of the current governance system of the Public Concession. For any plan for the future of the Public Concession, the Chinese and foreign communities within the area certainly have the right to express their opinions first. I must also visit, understand, and consider these opinions clearly. The procedures for the investigation have been summarized in the report, and the various sources of information obtained have also been mentioned. In addition, it has been pointed out that, in terms of the current situation in Shanghai, it is difficult to conduct a public investigation. Compared with most other central locations in China, Shanghai has more freedom of discussion. The main reason is that it is convenient to publish opinions on current affairs issues in Western newspapers. However, even in Shanghai, it is difficult for foreigners to freely and publicly discuss political issues, and it is probably impossible for Chinese people. The report also said that the Chamber of Commerce, the Bankers Association, other organizations representing commercial interests, and certain Chinese organizations have given valuable statements directly or indirectly related to political issues and allowed them to be published. However, most of the people who gave their opinions personally made it clear that when mentioning the opinions of these people, the person who expressed the opinions should not be disclosed. All the assistance and suggestions obtained from all parties under this restriction are worthy of gratitude.</p>
<p>Second Compilation: The general nature of the contents of this compilation is as follows: The reason why the existing institutions of the Public Concession can develop to the present level is due to gradual evolution. To prepare a construction plan for the future of the Concession, we must first study the process of this evolution; otherwise, the various problems that need to be solved at present will not be clear, that is, we will not be able to understand the true relationship of each problem. Therefore, the content of the second compilation is, as its title states, to trace its history and describe its status. The first chapter of the second compilation briefly describes the current situation of Shanghai and its administrative area. The second chapter describes the origin and development of the Public Concession. It mentions that, at the beginning of its establishment, the Concession was originally regarded as a residence for British residents, but the British authorities did not insist that it was only for British residents, so most people from other countries could enjoy equal rights in the Concession and could participate equally in political affairs. The Concession, which belongs to this kind of nature, has important differences from the concession area exclusively managed by one country. Its name is Concession instead of Shanghai Concession (the French Concession is not included), which also has important consequences. The report mentions the following important points: The Public Concession in Shanghai was initially just a small place, originally designated as a residence for British residents. Later, it gradually expanded. The concessions of other treaty ports in China are separated from each other and intersect with each other, while the Public Concession in Shanghai is of a mixed nature, forming a single autonomous group. Most people of various countries within the area are governed by the civil municipal system, and the limited supervisory powers are retained, so that it belongs to the consular corps of various countries that enjoy extraterritoriality and have their own people living in the area, and not to the consul of any one country. The organizational characteristics of the foreign community in Shanghai are like this, and the large number of countries related to the Shanghai Public Concession has made the historical situation in Shanghai complex and made progress slower and more difficult than concessions managed by only one foreign country. However, the result of the union can add strength, increase independent methods, and enable all foreigners to not only undertake municipal administration, but also to expand its activities on a larger scale than areas managed separately in other locations, and can develop a habit of international cooperation. This habit has its own special value and may prove to be increasingly important in the future.</p>

<h3>Anecdotes of the King Addicted to Drama</h3>
<p>— Cicada Slough</p>
<p>Is drama entertainment or art? Neither is an issue here. Take my old friend, the King Addicted to Drama. It would be wrong to praise his politics or promote his literature. The King simply loves to watch plays. When he was a student in Shanghai, he didn't miss a single play, except when he had classes. If he had money, he would buy a seat in the stalls; if not, he would stand at the back. He was a true believer in watching plays, rain or shine. Moreover, he was sincerely there to watch the plays, not to promote the actors or write critical reviews. He went to every theater, knew every actor. This was enough to qualify him as addicted to drama. However, because of his sacred and august position, ever since he graduated from Shanghai, he was hired in Liaoning, first as a teacher, then as a secretary. Whenever there was a long summer vacation, or when he went to Beijing on official business, the King was always found in the theaters of Dashilan. The King once said, "One must watch plays in Beijing to appreciate the beauty of Beijing opera." As for the King's time in Fengtian, he watched plays every single day.</p>
<p>When Grand Marshal Zhang opened his headquarters in Beiping, the King, with his high position, was attended to by many. But the King's addiction to watching plays remained unchanged. He felt unwell if he didn't see a play for a day. Thus, friends in Beijing and elsewhere called him the King Addicted to Drama. Even Grand Marshal Zhang called him by this name.</p>
<p>Grand Marshal Zhang had advisors like clouds and soldiers like rain. Whenever he had free time, they would sit around him, discussing politics or history. The Grand Marshal would doze off, as if he heard nothing. Only the King's words, which were about thirty years of theater history, and whose origins were all from personal experience, without making friends in the theater world or writing articles for newspapers, would capture his attention. The King's evidence was the playbills from the past thirty years. Beijing originally had no playbills; he had his own handwritten diary. So the King's stories were about watching plays, not about the theater world. That's why the Grand Marshal would stroke his mustache and smile when the King spoke. Since the King graduated and left Shanghai, it has been twenty-five years. And these twenty-five years in Liaoning, Beiping, Tianjin, Shandong, and Guangdong have all been filled with playbills. Even during the five years he studied in Shanghai, traveling to Nanjing, Zhenjiang, and Suzhou, he always watched plays. Therefore, compiling these playbills together has already filled two large boxes.</p>
<p>The King is now sixty years old. His family urged him to return, so he resigned from Deputy Commander Zhang's office. Deputy Commander Zhang, valuing their old friendship, gifted him with 30,000 gold pieces as retirement funds and sent an adjutant to accompany him south. He has been in Shanghai for three days, visiting various theaters. The scenery is vaguely familiar, but the landscape has changed.</p>
<p>Yesterday, he paid me a special visit. Seeing each other felt like a lifetime had passed. I thought that the anecdotes of the King Addicted to Drama should be passed down in Shanghai as a model for playgoers. Therefore, I specially wrote this article to publicize it.</p>

<h3>Anecdotes of the Alleyways</h3>
<p>— Drunken Fool</p>
<p>Society is like a devil's den, and alleyways are full of jokes. Recently, the red rain adds to the sorrow, and the green windows are boring. I casually record a few anecdotes for your amusement.</p>
<p>A sudden, uninvited moving crew. One morning, a moving truck arrived at the entrance of an alleyway and stopped abruptly. Soon, a man and a woman led several workers straight into a certain family's house. They began to move out the rosewood furniture and other items in a flurry. They even went to the nearby police station to report the relocation. They loaded the items onto the truck and sped away. Meanwhile, the wife of the family hid in a neighbor's house. At the time, housemates and neighbors who witnessed this strange scene were all baffled. Later, when they questioned the wife, she tearfully said that her husband had a gambling addiction, and she had repeatedly warned him without success. Last night, he gambled at a gambling den in Beili. At first, he won a little, but then he lost heavily. In addition to emptying his pockets, he still owed over a thousand gold pieces. The people in the den were intimidating, and they forced him to write a promissory note, promising to repay the debt with the rosewood furniture in his house. That's why they came to move it today, she said. Everyone who heard this sighed at the wife's misfortune. With her home stripped bare, she couldn't stay there for a day. The next day, she packed up the remaining items and clothes and quietly moved away with her husband, no one knew where.</p>
<p>Everyone, please look at the model. In the front alleyway, there is a certain family, husband and wife. They live in a detached Western-style house. The wife is only seventeen years old, still with a childish air. She always greets people with a smile and is adorably naive. A few days ago, because of the heat, she was taking a bath behind closed doors in a room downstairs. A shop assistant from a neighboring store learned about it and peeped through the window. Soon, more and more people gathered, drawn by the rumors. The wife was very embarrassed. Suddenly, she stood up naked and declared to the crowd, "I might as well let you see your fill. It doesn't matter." The crowd was startled and scattered like birds and beasts. The wife happily told others, "This is the strategy of retreating to advance. It's my wonderful plan to withdraw the troops." Those who heard this laughed heartily.</p>
<p>Ask the one who tied the bell to untie it. A neighbor, Mr. A, works on a certain ship and is rarely at home. His wife couldn't bear the loneliness and had an affair with Mr. B, who lived in the same house. Mr. B was a widower, and their secret affair had been going on for a long time. One day, while they were in the midst of their tryst, Mr. A suddenly returned from outside. Mr. B hurriedly hid, and Mr. A didn't know anything. The next day, Mr. B, in a state of panic, developed a fever and chills, turning into typhoid fever. Mr. B's mother was very worried and said that the illness was caused by the wife. She launched a war of recrimination. The wife was also in the wrong and offered to pay for the medical expenses. Every day, the wife embraced Mr. B and rode in a rickshaw together to see the doctor. The scene was very amusing. Onlookers even thought they were a couple.</p>
<h3>One Evening of Song and Dance</h3>
<p>— Address</p>
<p>Last night, I watched the film "Border Province Swordsman" at the Summer Coolidge Theater. As the play ended and I was about to leave, I suddenly heard countless young girls making noise backstage. Curious, I watched as the audience left, and I stood alone to observe and inquire with a waiter. I learned that it was the actors of the Liwa Dance Troupe. The waiter said that the troupe would be performing at the theater starting on the 25th, so they were holding their final costume rehearsal on stage tonight. I have always been fond of singing and dancing, and the name "Liwa" had already deeply impressed me. Curious about what it was like, I got the consent of a certain gentleman from the troupe, so I was able to return to my seat and feast my eyes.</p>
<p>The dance drama rehearsed by the troupe consisted of four acts: "Youth," "Moonlit Heart," "Paired Shadows," and "Goddess Luo." In "Youth," there were 32 actors on stage. The costumes were quite novel, and the plot was also subtle. The most exciting part was the final scene, a dance performed by all 32 people. Every movement of their hands and feet was in rhythm and perfectly synchronized. This could not have been achieved in just a few days. The plot and lyrics of "Moonlit Heart" were quite exceptional. A man and a woman stood together in a suspended crescent moon, surrounded by stars, beautiful and enchanting. Watching the heartbroken girl singing a sad song under the moon made people tearful. In "Paired Shadows," there were 18 actors on stage. The first segment was roughly about ordinary men from all over the world wooing an extraordinary woman. In the end, they were all disappointed. The second segment was about ordinary women from all over the world wooing an extraordinary man. They were also all disappointed. Finally, a pair of extraordinary people loved each other. The ordinary men and women all sympathized with each other and loved each other. The intention of the play seemed to be that "the most perfect marriage in the world is only the paired shadows in a mirror frame." In "Goddess Luo," there were 65 actors on stage. The costumes and scenery were the most luxurious and novel in the play. I heard a certain gentleman from the troupe say that the cost of one hat was about a hundred US dollars. The final scene, with 65 people dancing and singing together, was solemn and magnificent, truly a grand event in the world of song and dance.</p>
<h3>Let Me Also Talk About Tuina</h3>
<p>— Shi Min</p>
<p>I once read the accounts of the origins and development of Tuina by Yingchuan Qiushui and other gentlemen. The references to classics and records were extremely detailed and comprehensive. I have not even glimpsed the doorway to the art of Tuina, so I dare not offer reckless praise. The following account is based on stories passed down by elders and is only meant to aid conversation. According to legend, the art of Tuina considers One-Finger Zen to be the orthodox school. Its strength is sufficient to cure all diseases, but unfortunately, only one in a hundred people who study it achieves great success. During the transition between the Ming and Qing dynasties, there was a recluse whose name has been lost, an old scholar who was learned and skilled in many arts. He had a unique approach to Tuina, creating many new methods that surpassed the ancients. After the dynasty change, he devoted himself even more to this art, hand-copying several exquisite volumes. These volumes gathered the essence of Bodhidharma's One-Finger Zen and incorporated his own views. The illustrations were detailed and the explanations were extremely thorough. After the recluse died, this secret book was scattered among the people. During the Jiaqing era, it eventually fell into the hands of a salt merchant named Huang in Jiangdu. It is said that Huang obtained this book simply because the calligraphy was powerful and the illustrations in the section on Qi Observation and the semi-nude figures in the gynecology section were in the style of famous artists. Therefore, he spent money to buy it, viewing it as an ordinary antique. Later, Huang's family declined. A member of the family named Aisheng, who was studying medicine, found the book in a box. He was overjoyed and studied it day and night, gaining much insight. Later, he became famous for his One-Finger Zen Tuina. He is now Dr. Huang Hanru, who hangs his pot at South Chengdu Road in Shanghai. Hanru's wife, Hanyun, and his son, Yizhao, both inherited his teachings. It is said that they owe much to this secret book.</p>
<h3>A Piece of Paper Worth Ten Thousand Gold</h3>
<p>— Dream</p>
<p>Japanese literary giant Kikuchi Kan has produced a body of work that is the envy of many. His literary reputation is well-known. The payment for his articles is calculated by the line, and the value of a piece of paper is considerable. Even a single line or word is valued accordingly by booksellers. The news of this spread and became a beautiful story. It is unexpected that there is something similar. A photograph can be awarded up to ten thousand US dollars. These events, shining one after another, are truly extraordinary.</p>
<p>The initiator of this award is Kodak, a company with a reputation for reliability. They started a photography competition two years ago. This year, they are making even greater efforts, launching a world photography competition with a prize of one hundred thousand yuan. However, only amateur photographers are allowed to participate, and the awards are divided into sixty levels to increase interest. There are also many awards for the Chinese side, including six major category awards, provincial and regional awards, and a national grand prize of one thousand yuan. The first-prize photos from each category will be collected and sent to Geneva for evaluation. The first-prize winner will receive one thousand US dollars. The best photo in the world will be awarded ten thousand US dollars and a sculpture of the goddess of photography. Thus, a single photograph can continuously receive awards amounting to more than ten thousand gold pieces. In today's increasingly urgent commercial warfare and fierce competition, many are trying to win by surprise in order to make their businesses far-reaching. Kodak's move is a way to take advantage of the situation. The business can be controlled. Throwing away ten thousand gold is indeed generous.</p>
<h3>Indian Travel Notes (34)</h3>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>Today, several Chinese monks, returning from worshipping the Buddha on the mountains of North India to the south, passed through Calcutta and were about to return to Rangoon. They also stayed at the Guanyin Temple in the Siyi Hall of the Chinese city. They came to the Mahayana Buddhist Association to see the Buddha's relics. I had never seen them before in my life. Today, I also respectfully viewed them. The secretary of the Mahayana Buddhist Association, Xin Hanjun, reverently opened the altar for viewing. They were in a small pagoda. The pagoda was golden. It was a sunny afternoon at one o'clock. In the Buddhist hall upstairs, the sunlight was shining directly in. I and three others faced east to view them. One piece was the Buddha's bone, weighing about half a tael. It was slightly black from age. Next to it, one grain was what is called a relic, about the size of a wheat grain, perfectly round, pure white in color. The sunlight reflected off it, with a slight glow. We respectfully bowed to it. There was a monk who was called a living Buddha who was fond of bowing. He would bow upon hearing a good word. He placed the small pagoda on his head and chanted mantras for about ten minutes. He also placed it on the heads of the three of us, saying that it could directly connect us to the wisdom of the Buddha. I once heard people say that Buddha's relics can emit light and can fly away on their own, decreasing or increasing in size. It is also said that their color varies depending on the person who sees them. Those who are advanced see golden light, those who are average see white light, and those who are inferior see black. Seven or eight tenths of my brain is material science, and I do not deny it. Spiritually, I still dare not determine whether this statement conforms to material science or whether the Buddha truly has supernatural powers and the color of the relics varies according to the level of the person. I remember ten years ago, when Okuma Shigenobu was prime minister of Japan, the King of Siam gave Buddha's relics to Japan. Okuma initiated a donation of 1.1 million from the cabinet to build a pagoda to store them. I don't know what happened to that matter. Or what happened after the earthquake.</p>
<p>I asked Xin Hanjun whether these relics were not stored in Ceylon, but in a certain place in India. The relics are different for Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, and Arhats. They are not bones, but the essence of the Dharma body of those who cultivate the Tao, like the Taoists' saying of achieving the elixir. According to people, all those who cultivate the Tao can obtain relics after cremation. After the Buddha's death, his bones were cremated and divided into several sections, and the relics were divided into several. The kings of various countries took them and built pagodas to store them. This matter is detailed in the Nirvana Sutra. Apart from mythology, I dare not easily believe it. In short, at least the Buddha was a great philosophical teacher. In his life, he lived a simple life to save sentient beings. In his death, he cremated his corpse to be distributed to relatives and disciples, crushing his bones and powdering his body in the hope of influencing the ignorance of sentient beings and leading them to correct wisdom. Liberation is like this, and it is enough. Mozi praised those who wore out their scalps and wore down their heels to benefit the world. The Buddha crushed his bones and cremated his body to leave a memory. His kindness and compassion for people were great. However, the Nirvana Sutra records that the kings of various countries almost used force to compete for the Buddha's bones. It is truly laughable. Fortunately, I am a commoner, so I can view the Buddha's bones without interference. If I were an emperor, I would not necessarily be able to see the Buddha's bones. Mr. Han Yu also wrote a memorial to argue for them, adding to the troubles. It can be seen that emperors are not as free as commoners.</p>
<p>On the 21st, I read a book called "Calcutta," written by Hassan Suprawardy and narrated by Seferoldwa. It tells of the English's first conquest of India, which is something we like to hear. I extracted a few points below. Briefly, the first to arrive in India in 1625 were the Portuguese and the Dutch, who operated shops at the mouth of the Hooghly River, which is the mouth of the Ganges. Thirty years later, in 1658, the English began to trade. Their trading company was called the East India Company. At this time, it was near the 17th century. English trade was very prosperous here. The small village where they operated was called Hooghly, which was the base for the English's development. Times create heroes. A manager in the company named Senior Agent Jot Charnock (translated as Ke Leifei in the past, which is probably the Cantonese pronunciation) arrived in India in 1682. Based on this company's mechanism, he created a unified Indian government. Charnock was the creator of the English conquest of India.</p>

<p>Gold Prices Rise Again</p>
<p>Rising More Than Seven Taels Compared to Yesterday</p>
<p>No Many Units, People's Hearts Are Solid. Yesterday, the 24th, gold prices rebounded and rose again, with slight changes. There were fluctuations of two or three taels to five or six taels. The morning market fluctuated around 730 taels, and the afternoon was often above 33 taels. The total market had a review of 15 taels, and finally rose more than 7 taels. However, the exchange rate slightly reversed, seemingly showing a potential for easing. It once posted a long position, which was opposite to the gold market. Therefore, English gold arbitrage was suitable, only leaving about 20 taels, especially close in the afternoon, only about 16 or 17 taels, which was very different from before. It is likely that the foreign silver market has risen and is not affected by the slight drop in gold prices. In the future, buying will be strong, because the bill of exchange seems to be tight, so it has escaped the 30 tael mark. Later, because sellers were not lonely and the bill of exchange weakened, English gold loosened by 1.25, so it dropped by five or six taels. After the market, buyers were agile and presented an upward trend, nearly 40 taels. Afterwards, the bill of exchange did not see improvement, and it was frustrated again, but the result was mild, totaling 36 or 37 taels. In short, there are not many units, and people's hearts are solid here.</p>
<p>Fluctuating Around 30 Taels. Since the opening of the June term gold bid in the morning market, it only fell by 1.8 cents, totaling 726.5 taels, but the large unit has risen by 16.5%, the silver price has increased by 1/2, and the private telegram has also increased by 3/8. However, Chunyuan, Yongyi, Fengyongyi, Yu, etc. all paid in, so it returned high by 5 cents, totaling 27 taels. Yu Da, Yongfeng, and arbitrage sold out, and it fell to 24.1 taels. In a moment, it rose calmly, and Dadecheng, Hengyu, Hongli, etc. bought in, and also settled English gold with colleagues, totaling 13.5 in June, so at 9:18 it rose to 30.012 taels. At this time, arbitrage, etc. sold off, and it was expected that the previous order would have a long position, so it retreated to 29 taels. When the HSBC listing was announced, it rose by 2.5, US dollars by 50 cents, and Japanese gold fell by 2.75 cents, at 28.2 taels. But it did not have too much impact. The system is still stable inside. HSBC, Huabi, etc. came up with 134375, and Tianyu, Yongzhifengyong, etc. came to buy, so it gradually raised by five or six taels, totaling 34.2 taels at 9:50. After 10 o'clock, it fell again, with only two or three taels lurking, that is, English gold seemed to be loosening, which could settle half a penny, and Yongfeng, Tongtaichang, Fuchang, etc. on the table all sold, so it broke the 30 tael mark. After 11 o'clock, it was even more softened. Sumitomo sold English gold 625, nearly 27.8 taels at 11:30. In a moment, Daxing Yonglai entered, pulling up 4 taels, totaling 32 taels. Zhifeng Yongwu came to sell, suppressing it to 30.023 taels before the market closed. By noon, it closed at 31.2 taels, and then raised one tael again. The announced price was changed to 771 taels, totaling around 40 taels.</p>
<p>Buying Households' Activities Gradually Reveal a Good Face. The after-market opened at 33 taels, and then increased from 32.5 taels to 37 taels, that is, Yuanmaoyong bought in, and the exchange market was still stable. The Central Bank sold to Mitsui, Korea, etc. the August Citibank 31.4375 to 375. Then, because Yuanheng Fuchang sold out, it retreated to 35.2 taels. Then, Qianchang Xiangyuan Chenghangxing and a certain bank bought in, and English gold only settled 4375, which immediately rose 4 taels, to 39 taels at 2:15. Afterwards, Fuchang Dadecheng, etc. sold, already potential small face, but always advancing and retreating, totaling more than 2 taels of plate. At 3:30, it was 35.5 taels, and Hengxing Zhifengyong, etc. bought in, and it was also better by more than 2 taels, totaling 37.7 cents at 3:40. After entering, Longsheng and others did not slacken their intention to sell, and again in a weakened state, falling by 4.67 cents, to 33 taels at 4:20. At this time, Tongtaichang, etc. bought in, and pulled up 2.5 taels, and at 4:30 the market closed at 35.5 taels, and again made to 36.78 cents.

<h3>Foreign Exchange Trends Easing</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the British, American, Indian, and silver markets have all rebounded, and the exchange rate has also risen.

The trend of the British, American, and Japanese exchanges in the domestic market also eased, but there was a slight reversal, from flat in the morning, and then seemed firm, peaceful at noon, and firm but weak in the afternoon. As a result, compared to the previous day, the British and American exchanges were not very different, and Japanese gold increased by 2.5, but according to the gold market, it was greatly opposite, because the bid for gold rebounded, and it broke out of the 35 tael mark, so arbitrage gradually approached, the highest English gold arbitrage was more than 20 taels, the lowest was only about 16 taels, that is, there was a rush to settle in the industry, so the units came out, as for throwing out bills of exchange, it was not a good deal. Yesterday, Fuchang, etc. settled in about 300,000 pounds of English gold, and banks such as Shanghai Mitsui Huabi HSBC Mikei Masakane Sumitomo all sold out. Also, only a few US dollars were settled in, but the Central Bank sold quite a lot to arbitrage foreign exchange.

<h3>The Yarn and Cotton Market Presents a Quiet and Firm Atmosphere</h3>
<p>The yarn market is slightly firm, but the trend is still soft. This is because the overseas cotton yarn situation is very weak, so retail investors are mostly bearish. The overall situation is still flat. However, the gold price is still firm, and the market can be slightly hardened. There is no large-scale development in spot yarn sales, but scattered transactions are still uninterrupted. The auction yarn price has risen due to the Sichuan gang covering short positions. The buying interest in the market is slightly tight, but the major players are still inactive. For the time being, it is still a flat situation.</p>
<p>Sichuan Gang Covers Short Positions in Auctions: In the opening market for auctions, American cotton was still flat, and the market situation was not good. Later, due to the Sichuan gang and a certain factory covering short positions, the price rose by 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 qian. The market situation in the afternoon was still flat, and each month rose by another 1 or 2 qian. The transaction statistics were 21,200 bales. It was found that Ruida sold 1,100 bales, Lichang 600 bales, Xincheng 600 bales, Tianlong 750 bales, and Yukang 450 bales.

<h3>The Cotton Market Slightly Reveals a Promising Outlook</h3>
<p>The cotton market is slightly up, but the overseas cotton market is flat. However, the gold price is difficult to fall, resulting in a good mood. Japanese merchants are holding tight and not releasing, but general retail investors and colleagues are trending towards short selling. Due to the lack of spot cotton transactions, there is also a temporary stalemate.</p>
<p>Han Standard Cotton is Stable: The Han Standard cotton market opened in the early market. The situation was good due to the stability of American cotton. Each month rose by 1 or 2 qian. The afternoon was calm, rising by 5 fen. The total transaction statistics for the whole day were 33,000 dan.

<h3>Grain and Rice Market: Firm in the Morning, Flat in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, there were about 20 boats arriving on the inner roads. In the early morning, the opening of Northern Japonica rice was tight due to the lingering effects of the previous day's overcast rain. The intention to enter was also active at this time, so the price once turned firm near the corner. However, by midday, the sky cleared up, and the buying interest suddenly weakened, so the market became flat. As a result, all grades of white Japonica rice were the same as the closing price of the previous day. The supply of Bo Dao rice was not strong, and the sales market shifted with the Japonica rice market, so there was little upward or downward movement. Yang Xian rice and Du Bu Xian rice seemed active at the initial opening, but they soon settled down. There were not many transactions throughout the day, and the situation was stable. White Yuan rice shipments were rare, and sales became brisk, raising the price by one jiao and a half.</p>
<p>Hunan: Yesterday, there were about 20 boats arriving from the river. Sales in the street were still acceptable. The Jibai Japonica rice on the west and north roads had a very promising market atmosphere in the morning, with the market rising to the left of the corner. In the afternoon, the sky cleared, and the mood turned flat, with transactions becoming weak. However, the price remained firm. The overall opening market today will inevitably decline slightly, which is not strange. On the southern road, the arrival and sales of thin early rice were both matched, and the market rose by nearly a foot. The Yang Du Jian market presented a hovering pattern. Since the goods were scarce, the price also rose or fell by only a few fen. The Yin Hua rice supply and sales were both dry, and sales suddenly improved, so the market increased by one or two jiao.</p>
<h3>Auction Flour Turns Weak Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market: After the opening in the morning and afternoon, the prices for each month generally turned flat and weak again. Because the foreign wheat quote decreased by two or three jiao, everyone's perception inevitably focused on one side. The market price for this month had weakened, but the manufacturers' purchases made it feel stable. As for the long-term months, because the actual sales gangs were inactive and the foreign atmosphere returned to a state of oversupply, it could no longer be determined whether foreign wheat would be stable. The import of foreign flour was inevitable. Therefore, this guest's gangs were all in a state of quietness. The market atmosphere became depressed. The future trend may re-enter a dangerous situation. As a result, the current month was unchanged, May was down by a small 7 li and a half, June and July were down by a small 1 fen, August was down by a small 5 li, and September was down by a small 7 li and a half.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Market Weakens</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market in the morning, the markets for each month showed a near-stable and far-weakening trend. Although the foreign wheat was quoted down by a small two or three jiao, the weather was still overcast, so most people did not see any impulse. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, the markets for each month had gradually changed. Because the current month was approaching delivery, the ratio of long and short positions was already perceived as more supply than demand. Because the cargo release was very smooth, and only one or two manufacturers were receiving, the market situation became very weak. The current month could not be suppressed, and the long-term months naturally could not stand firm. It was said that the spot wheat in each warehouse was indeed heavily accumulated (it was heard that Tai Run Bank arrived again with nearly 100,000 bags yesterday). As a result, the current month fell by 5 fen compared to the previous day, May fell by 4 fen, June fell by 3 fen, July fell by 5 fen, August fell by 3 fen, and September fell by 2 fen.</p>
<h3>Dried and Preserved Goods: Jinshan Branches Suddenly Rise</h3>
<p>Jinshan branches had been slow-moving, and the market had reached 33 or 34 taels. According to news from the production area, last year's winter was too cold, and this spring's flowering was very sparse. From the current phenomenon, this year's new harvest will inevitably be poor, and the current stock is not much. Since there are fewer arrivals, yesterday's market suddenly trended up. Ordinary goods rose by about 3 taels, and high-quality goods rose to more than 40 taels. Retail prices also rose accordingly.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: White Tung Oil Sales Decline</h3>
<p>For the past five or six years, white tung oil has relied heavily on export trade, averaging over 50,000 tons each year, with 4,000 to 5,000 tons per month going to foreign traders. The market's momentum can be imagined. Since the autumn and winter of the year before last, the European and American businesses have gradually declined due to the impact of high gold prices. According to statistics from the old year, only over 2,000 tons were exported throughout the year. The reason for this is that many American paint companies were restricted by finance and were mostly closed down, resulting in a sharp reduction in usage. The majority of China's tung oil exports are to the United States, followed by Europe. Since the United States reduced procurement, China's exports were severely impacted. Therefore, last year's market price plummeted. In previous years, the average was always around 30 taels, but it has fallen to around 20 taels now, oscillating back and forth, a difference of 10 taels compared to two years ago. Both quantity and price are now incomparable. In the past two weeks, according to the so-called Han telegram, it was once sold for 20 taels and 5 qian and 7 qian and a half. However, each transaction was only dozens of tons, up to 100 to 200 tons. The days of thousands of tons at a time are gone, and the market's vigorous momentum is only a historical relic. Yesterday, according to Han Xun, 35 tons were sold, and the price was 20 taels and 2 qian in foreign regulations. Foreign firms only had sporadic transactions, and the market was only stable, with nothing exciting to report. It was heard that traders were opening进客货计襄桐at 18 taels and 2 qian客盘. Sichuan tung oil is arriving today, and wholesale prices are between 18 taels and 2 qian and 18 taels. The Zhejiang tung oil purchased by local firms in the city was at a maximum of 31 yuan per load a week ago, but has recently fallen to 30 yuan. Domestic sales will enter the silkworm season soon and gradually decline.</p>
<h3>Textiles: Each Commodity Trend is Slightly Soft</h3>
<p>Local Cotton Cloth: The market was quite sluggish yesterday, and sentiment was soft. With the end of the month approaching, those in urgent need of funds were eager to sell. Therefore, fine cloth fell by about 5 fen, with 彩球 at 7 taels, 5 qian and a half, 阳鹤 at 7 taels, 6 qian and a half, and 蓝飞鱼 at 7 taels, 9 qian and 2 fen and a half. Because the 四军帮 searched,現货断档 (out of stock), and 蓝鷄 also fell to 6 taels and 3 qian. There were not many transactions yesterday, and the main reason was the inactivity of the northern gangs. Fine twill also had no vitality. The market for coarse cloth in the street was weaker than before. 11-pound 三兎 sold for 5 taels, 4 qian and 7 fen and a half, and 人钟 for 5 taels and 3 qian and a half, also a slight decrease compared to before. However, the Yihua blue striped bleached cloth continued to trend higher, reaching 8 taels and a half.</p>
<p>Eastern and Western Textiles: Although the gold market rebounded yesterday, the price of goods failed to rise accordingly. Only the 湖心亭細嗶嘰 of the eastern goods rose by two and a half li due to the lack of spot goods. The 第一功直貢緞断档 (out of stock), and the 直貢呢 became softer. The 莫干山猎雁 also dropped slightly by two and a half li. Striped fu silk was quite hard. The 清宫镜 has been sold out, and the 湖心亭杨贵妃 reached 3 qian and 8 fen, and local merchants have added purchases. White crepe cloth remained stable. There was no货 of花直贡呢, and bleached cloth was softer than before, with 郭子仪 opening at 12 taels and 8 qian and a half, 金山寺 at 12 taels and 5 qian, and 花鸟 at 8 taels and 4 qian and a half. The 迴纹嗶嘰走销日静 (sales of small pattern serge are slowing day by day), and there is still strong demand for 元羽绸本卫. The 清宫镜 is 12 taels and 8 qian and a half, the 竹林 is 11 taels and 9 qian, the 三潭 is 11 taels and 5 qian, and the 文昭关 is 11 taels and 3 qian.</p>
<h3>Hardware: American Tinplate Opened with 400 to 500 Boxes Yesterday</h3>
<p>Hardware transactions progressed quite well yesterday. More goods were opened in the market than before, and American tinplate, which had not been inquired about for a long time, opened with 400 to 500 boxes yesterday, with a price of 17 taels per box (90 pounds), while 100 pounds sold for 18 taels. It was heard that Sichuan, Henan and other groups have also had negotiations recently.</p>
<p>Bamboo section steel bars: 140 to 150 tons arrived at the Gonghexiang Pier yesterday.</p>
