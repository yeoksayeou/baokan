<p>目前洪水肆虐。大地陸沉。江南河北。哀鴻徧野。災情之重。爲二十年來所未見。記者前已二次爲評。籲請國人予以注意。并急起自動捐助賑救。今請更申論捐錢之人生觀。爲國人進一解。錢之爲物·及其爲用。吾人應具有一正確之觀念。（一）錢爲一種死的物品。調度之·運用之。在於活的人。尤在於活的用。（二）錢來自社會。應爲社會用。應用於社會。（三）錢之於人。如肥料之於植物。不可過少。亦不必過多。過少則無以爲生。過多則不惟無益。甚且如過分的肥料之燒死植物。自身反蒙其實害。多積死守。獨自爲樂。不知善用。没可奈何。是即人不能用錢。反爲錢所玩弄也。朱門酒肉臭。路有凍死骨。一家歡笑。而一路號哭。是即錢之不能爲社會用。不能用於社會也。飽煖之後。繼以淫慾。奢靡淫佚。旣損精力。復耗時間。甚且惹出無謂之糾紛。是即過多之錢反以致害也。廣爲積蓄以貽子孫。子孫恃此。遂亦驕縱。則又多錢之貽害子孫也。故人之於錢。生不帶來。死不帶去。但求供我生存之用。不必作過量之積存。應爲錢之主人。不可爲錢之奴隸。應能用錢。不應爲錢用應用。之得當·得所·得時。用錢得當·得所·得時之道不一。興學也。舉辦實業也。皆錢之得其用者也。而當社會公衆之急難。解囊捐助。亦其一途。</p>
<p>今日之水災。急矣慘矣。嗷嗷哀鴻。急待拯救。捐我剩餘。拯彼急難。此正有錢者用錢之時。亦正用錢之最爲得當·得時·得所者也吾人固奚爲果不樂爲捐助。無錢者出力。沿門托鉢於富人之前。其爲力於災黎則一也。進一步言之。孟子有言。「獨樂不如與人同樂。」况今日之慘刧。即他日之亂象。災黎無衣無食。而謂我獨能飽食煖衣乎。故今日之助人。即所以助己。今日之救人。亦即所以救己。吾人又奚爲而不樂爲捐助。更進一步言之。急難互助。人皆有責。萬衆溺水。急倍倒懸。以言互助之責。固應捐助。以言同情之心。亦應捐助吾人更奚爲而不樂爲捐助。</p>
<p>或曰。「吾人今日果有餘力可以捐助者乎。」曰有。杜絶鴉片之耗費一也。節省購置船來高貴裝飾品之消費二也。撙節宴會之化費三也。不購置舶來之昻貴衣料。代以國有廉值之粗布之類。减省鉅大之糜費四也。省却麻雀賭博之糜費五也。節省汽車兜風之汽油消費六也。其他婚喪喜慶。皆極力撙節七也。就此七項糜費之撙節。爲數亦已至鉅。其所爲力於災黎者亦已至多。安能謂無餘力。特患吾人之不肯爲耳。記者言誠意切禱望尤殷。爲災黎請命。不憚煩凟。敬求國人一爲長思。急起力行。</p>

<p>路透六日倫敦電　財政部昨准英倫銀行發行一千五百萬鎊紙幣、計達紙幣總額二萬七千五百萬鎊此項增加之核准、以三星期爲期、此舉純爲防備計畫、蓋英倫銀行數日前鑒於該銀行存金之需求甚鉅、且以歷屆八月銀行休業期前後、公共提取現欵輒視前爲多、故請求增發紙幣也、英倫銀行現有存欵固足應付尋常需要、但預定增發紙幣、亦不爲無見、再法美與英倫銀行之放欵辦法、僅爲暫時計畫、俾渡過目前至十月底國會復開時之困難時期、負責方面希望屆時政府定可證明以節省方法使預算案收支相抵、</p>
<p>國民社一日倫敦電　今日此間及巴黎紐約同時發表、法蘭西銀行與美國聨邦儲備銀行商定放欵五千萬鎊於英倫銀行由兩銀行各半分擔、此舉係英法兩銀行總裁今晨在巴黎定議、并藉無綫電話與紐約聨邦儲備銀行商妥者、又英財政部同時發表、授權英倫銀行增加信用發行之鈔票額、得於三星期内由一千五萬鎊增至二萬七千五百萬鎊、以應八月内金融市塲之需要、蓋因該行所存金貨、一時尙無增加之望、故由財部授權增加信用發行之鈔票、</p>

<p>邇來天雨綿綿。半月未止。予前日因事歸烏鎭故里。連日風雨交作。河水驟漲。田禾淹没。船隻因橋樑水高。斷絶交通。雨窗無俚。爰將目覩之大水慘狀。分誌如下。</p>
<p>街上一片汪洋　大雨半月。河水暴漲。低窪之處。延流街道。如東栅勞家河埠起。至小烏鎭止。南栅稽家匯等處。積水數尺。尙有沿河一帶房屋。不下數千餘幢。咸淹没水中。有如一片汪洋。可憫也。</p>
<p>浮橋上行路難　鎭上如嚴廳内弄。財神灣。三里塘。街上積水數寸。康莊大道。均有行不得也哥哥之歎。因架木作浮橋。以便交通。摩登女子。足登高跟皮鞋。經浮橋時。大呼行路難不止。</p>
<p>男女晝夜戽水鄉間農人。泰半以耕種爲生。此次陡遭天災。田禾將没。於是農夫農婦。晝夜戽水不歇。含辛茹苦。不幸極矣。</p>
<p>各鄉報告水災　自七月六日傾盆雨後。迄今二十多日。且又陰雨連朝。水勢日漲。四鄉數百畝田稻。均成澤國。若天晴水退。猶可挽救。不料日來依然多雨。且暗中水漲甚劇。水災現象已成。農田粒米無收。故農人紛赴縣署。報告水災者。接踵而至。</p>
<p>米價逐日飛漲　河水高漲。米糧來源稀少。米商即乘機抬高米價。每擔漲至一元。一日連漲二次。於是米商笑逐顔開。而小民苦矣。</p>

<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>四號。是日爲印度新年節。九時。學生等正式行塗彩及潑水禮。一一至敎長處。敎長一一與行禮。禮有二種。一每學生執紅粉塗敎長之面額。二敎長與行左右肩相接禮。試思每生皆塗一次。數百生如此。則敎長之頭面可知矣。印度大學制度。大學有一校長。其下分六七部每部。一敎長。全權處理一切事。無校長書名也。各生互以彩色水相灑。有來塗余面者。余只許其點額。但人人若來則大苦。余乃閉門不出。俄而有叩門來行塗禮者。意至殷勤也。彼等問余中國有此俗否。答曰。無之。聞法國有散花會。每逢佳節。全市民出遊互相擲以花。其花紛紛落地上。厚數寸印度多花若改灑水塗面者易以散花則較香雅而有趣學生言吾等知此俗不算甚好渾身皆汚。衣不可穿。全國若狂。但改之不易。此印度敎俗也。余言今世界凡事更新。汝可作文登報喜吹之。須更新俗以圖進化。蓋其塗面之理由。根於宗敎。凡印人塗面者。皆修行之士。表接近於神者。今模仿推廣之。逢年節人人塗之以表接近於神。爲大吉慶之禮也。根於信仰。故不易革。惟易以散花。似不難耳。至其行塗禮後。仍須給以糖果。如吾國拜年然。故少年更歡喜爲此運動也。</p>
<p>吾人間接從英文上讀印度史。甚難記其人名地名。印度人名尤難記。甚異於中國人名之簡單也。吾最反對者。爲印度文矣。吾雖知友人言梵文如何好。然觀佛經之反覆贅累。甚嫌笨滯。而討厭者。尤在其人名也。常於多日熟人。吾不能呼其名。此非華人之笨。乃印語之笨耳。然印人之名皆有哲學宗敎深義。吾人愛其義而惡其名也。</p>
<p>據印史佛敎興於西歷前六世紀。至西歷後十二世紀而衰亡。印度敎復興。則佛敎之盛行於印度。凡千八百年。今亡又七百餘年矣。將來有復興之勢。當西歷前二七三年。阿輸迦王曾統一五印。遣其弟妹往錫蘭傳敎。吾問錫蘭友人說實話者。不信佛曾親到過錫蘭也。然經有在楞迦山說法之事。或佛乘舟而往。則亦不難。若飛行化身神話。余不敢輕信也。阿輸迦王爲惟一聖王。史云其造官道樹以芒果樹造公井證忠孝之訓全國刑措無罪人蓋唐虞之治矣然一僧告我阿輸王初不信佛。用兵時欲殺一比丘。比丘毫無懼色。王怪問其何不怕死。答以了生死故。王因就問佛法之事。感而信佛也。</p>

<p>— 姚蘇鳳</p>
<p>不等到他回答，他的母親也忍不住了。伊原想小榮回來了，總得住過一兩天再去，現在聽他說立刻就要走，自然很不高興。所以伊也苦苦地呌小榮留着。但是小榮却老是這樣的表示着非去不可。</p>
<p>他的父親呢，也覺得小榮的立刻谅要回上海去是不應該的。他堅决地說：「不行！回來了就要錢，錢拿到了就要走，不必說你是兒子，我是你的爸爸，呌你明天去你總得依從着：就說你是我的老長輩，我是你的後生小子，請你求你明天去，難道你也不應該賞一個臉兒麽？」他顯然有些生氣了。小榮却做聲不得。</p>
<p>但是，小榮依舊覺得非去不可，無論他妻子的央求，他母親的勸挽，他父親的命令，都歸失敗。他父親這纔惱怒了。「好！讓他去吧！你們也不必再跟他多講·」他說罷就向外面走了。</p>
<p>小榮的妻子幾乎要哭出來，但小榮却頭也不回的跟着他父親直挺挺地走了出去，非但没有說半句道别的話，連眼睛也没有看一下。</p>
<p>小榮終于坐着他父親的馬車增了。他的母親和妻子，一直送到門口，他也好像没有看見。當馬車遠遠地拖了過去，從整個的車馬和人，縮小到像一星黑點的時候，伊們還伸長了脖子遙望着；一會兒，什麽都消失在伊們的目光中了，婆媳倆祗有相對着嘆了一口氣，懶洋洋地走了進去。</p>
<p>一邊，馬車已經到了車站，小榮下了車，總算向他父親說了幾句話：「爸爸！我去了！我一有空就要回來的！」</p>
<p>「你在學校裏要好好的用功讀書，讀一本書就要想一想你這讀書的錢是那裏來的。好好的去罷！不要偷懶愛玩，孤負了我們一片好心！」</p>
<p>小榮點了一點頭，就向人叢中走了進去·他的父親雖然覺得很憤怒，但是一想到自已辛辛苦苦地拉了十五年的馬車，什麽都没有長進；祗有這樣的一個兒子，一切的希望全在他身上。便微微地自己笑了。</p>
<p>火車開了，來時坐在三等車裏的小榮，現在是昻然地坐在二等車中，喝着汽水，吃着西菜，又有誰知道他的錢是那裏來的呢？</p>
<p>三小時後，龐然的上海，又閃耀在小榮的眼裏，他才恢復了一天以前的活躍。他家裏的一切，已經消失在車輪的轉動中，他不願再想起，也不會再想起。</p>

Shi claimed to have 70,000 troops, but they were all a motley crew. His subordinates were divided into the Jilin faction, the Anhui faction, and the Fujian faction. Shi issued very simple orders: "Do you love foreign money and beautiful women?" The crowd responded, "We do!" Shi then said, "Attack Shijiazhuang, and you can fulfill your desires!" So they set off.

<p>Senior Chinese Police Officers All Request to Leave</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Anglo-Chinese Board of Directors of the British Concession decided in the summer of the year before last to hire Zhang Daohong as the Chief of Police, marking the beginning of Chinese management of the concession's police power. Last month, without the permission of the Chinese directors or Zhang's agreement, the British appointed Esman Ge as Police Chief.

It is said that the reasons for the disaster were: (1) The Yangtze and Han rivers rose simultaneously, leaving nowhere for the water to be discharged; (2) Hundreds of thousands of dollars were embezzled, and it was not possible to nurture and repair the embankments; (3) The official government's rescue efforts were inadequate, leading to this unprecedented disaster.

It is said that the relief agencies plan to collect one month's rent in Shanghai, which is estimated to yield 60 million yuan in cash, and will propose this to the government and earnestly discuss it with the gentry and business circles in Shanghai.

<h3 id="e15">(1) Rescuing Others and Rescuing Oneself <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Currently, floods are raging. The earth is sinking. South of the Yangtze River and north of the Yellow River, cries of sorrow are everywhere. The severity of the disaster is unprecedented in the past twenty years. This reporter has already commented twice, appealing to the people of the country to pay attention and immediately take the initiative to donate to relief efforts. Now, I would like to further elaborate on the outlook on life of donating money to further enlighten the people of the country. Regarding money as an object and its use, we should have a correct view. (1) Money is a kind of dead object. It is the living people who mobilize it and use it, especially for living uses. (2) Money comes from society and should be used for society and applied to society. (3) Money is to people as fertilizer is to plants. It cannot be too little, nor does it need to be too much. Too little, and there is no way to survive. Too much is not only useless, but it may even burn the plants like excessive fertilizer, causing them to suffer the consequences. Accumulating wealth excessively and guarding it jealously, enjoying oneself alone without knowing how to make good use of it, is futile. This is when people cannot use money and are instead manipulated by money. "Behind the vermilion gates, meat and wine are left to rot, while along the roads lie the bones of those who have frozen to death." One family rejoices, while an entire road cries. This is when money cannot be used for society or applied to society. After being well-fed and clothed, one indulges in licentiousness. Extravagance and dissipation not only deplete one's energy but also waste time, and even cause unnecessary disputes. This is when excessive money leads to harm. Accumulating vast wealth to leave to one's descendants, who then become arrogant and indulgent, is another way in which too much money harms one's descendants. Therefore, people do not bring money into this world, nor do they take it with them when they die. One should only seek to use it for one's survival and not accumulate excessive amounts. One should be the master of money, not the slave of money. One should be able to use money, not be used by money. Using it appropriately, in the right place, and at the right time. There are many ways to use money appropriately, in the right place, and at the right time. Establishing schools and running businesses are all ways to use money effectively. Donating to help society and the public in times of emergency is also one way.</p>
<p>Today's flood disaster is urgent and tragic. The cries of sorrowful people are awaiting rescue. Donating our surplus to help those in dire need is precisely the time for those with money to use it, and it is also the most appropriate, timely, and effective use of money. Why should we not be happy to donate? Those without money can contribute their efforts, begging from door to door from the rich, which is the same as contributing to the disaster victims. To take it a step further, Mencius said, "It is better to share happiness with others than to enjoy it alone." Moreover, today's tragedy is tomorrow's chaos. How can we claim to be able to eat and dress warmly when disaster victims have no clothes or food? Therefore, helping others today is helping oneself. Rescuing others today is rescuing oneself. Why should we not be happy to donate? To take it another step further, mutual assistance in times of emergency is everyone's responsibility. Countless people are drowning, a situation of extreme urgency. Speaking of the responsibility of mutual assistance, we should donate. Speaking of the heart of compassion, we should also donate. Why should we not be happy to donate?</p>
<p>Some may ask, "Do we really have the surplus resources to donate today?" I say yes. Eliminating the waste of opium is one. Saving on the consumption of purchasing imported, expensive decorations is two. Cutting back on the cost of banquets is three. Not purchasing imported, expensive clothing and replacing them with inexpensive domestic coarse cloth is a significant reduction in waste, four. Saving on the waste of mahjong gambling is five. Saving on the gasoline consumption of car rides is six. Other weddings, funerals, and celebrations should all be reduced to the greatest extent possible, seven. Reducing waste in these seven areas will amount to a significant sum. The impact on the disaster victims will also be great. How can we say that we have no surplus resources? The only worry is that we are unwilling to do it. This reporter's words are sincere and earnest, hoping for the lives of the disaster victims. I am not afraid of being long-winded. I respectfully ask the people of the country to think deeply and take action immediately.</p>
<p>National Important Telegrams II</p>
<h3 id="e16">Remarks from a Certain Important Figure <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<h3 id="e17">The Central Government's Attitude Towards Guangdong <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain important figure said that Zhang Ji, Wu Tiecheng, and Li Shizeng, acting on their own, sent a telegram to Guangzhou. This was their personal action and not authorized by the central government. It is unknown how Guangzhou replied. The Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee only decided on the overall policy. It is focused on peace with Guangdong and suppressing the bandits. Currently, the Red Bandit's nest has been wiped out, and only scattered bandits remain, which will not be difficult to eliminate. However, the Guangdong side suddenly attempted to advance north when the Red Bandits were on the verge of extinction. Chiang Kai-shek has reported this by telegram. Recently, Shi Yousan's rebellion in the north is also related to the Guangdong side. The essence of the problem lies in the party. The party has a consensus system and cannot be appropriated by a small number of Western Hills Faction special committee members, nor can it be manipulated by a small number of people from any side. If the Guangdong side is truly sincere, recognizes its mistake in assisting Shi, and resolutely participates in the Fourth National Congress to be held this October, then all problems can be discussed. Now the Guangdong side often uses the party as an excuse, as if the legacy of Sun Yat-sen can only be inherited by the Western Hills Faction, that the politics of the tutelage period should be monopolized by Guangdong, and that the National Assembly and the Provisional Constitution, in which the masses participate, are seen as disrupting their special powers. Using the party in this way is not the will of the people. Moreover, the Guangdong side's recent measures do not require the party. There are obvious examples. (August 2nd Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>National News Agency, Ottawa, 1st: Mr. and Mrs. Lindbergh departed from here at 10:00 this morning, and were scheduled to arrive in Moose Factory at 4:00 in the afternoon. However, after flying 275 miles past Lake Expanse, their plane disappeared. As of late tonight, there is still no news.</p>
<p>Telegraphic News Agency, Ottawa, 1st: After passing over Lake Expanse, Mr. and Mrs. Lindbergh's plane still sent out a radio message stating that they were flying safely, but then there was no further news. According to an aviator engaged in scheduled flights from Hudson Bay to Alaska, the area from Lake Expanse to Moose Factory is a vast wasteland with few people. If they disappeared in this area, it would be difficult to rescue them.</p>
<p>Telegraphic News Agency, Toronto, 1st: In Coral Rapids, 45 miles from Moose Factory, specialists waited all day for the Lindbergh plane to arrive, but by 8:00 in the afternoon, there was still no sign of the plane, nor had any radio messages been received.

<p>Nothing More Than Seeking a Market for Surplus Agricultural Products</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 1st: German banks are still unable to return to normal. Today, the President issued a supplementary order to the order of the 28th of last month, adding restrictions on bank transactions and payments, only slightly looser than the previous order. The President also signed an emergency decree to manage foreign currency transactions within the country, forcing foreign banks to no longer withdraw loans from Germany, which is tantamount to prohibiting the export of gold. In addition, it is heard that the President will issue another new order to place all domestic banks under government supervision, so that the financial panic can be overcome as soon as possible. The current domestic opinion is more optimistic than in the previous weeks. The general sentiment believes that the current government is sufficient to control the situation and safely overcome the difficulties. It is also expected that since restrictions on bank payments are still in place, the unusual discount rate of the Deutsche Bank can also be appropriately reduced within ten days.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 2nd: President Hindenburg has approved the ordinance on the trading of foreign currencies, which will take effect on August 4th. From then on, only the Deutsche Bank will have the right to directly buy and sell foreign currencies. All applications to purchase foreign currencies, except for paying interest or repaying the principal of long-term loans, will not be approved.</p>

Because of obvious signs of instability in the domestic political situation, the Chancellor must return to the capital on Monday. After the results of the Prussian plebiscite on the dissolution of the parliament are announced, there may be further changes to all government measures.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 1st: The current French Ambassador to Germany, Mr. Magilly, has repeatedly requested retirement due to old age. It is heard that the French government has internally appointed the current Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Ponsot, to succeed him. It is said that this move has been agreed to by the German government. Mr. Ponsot has worked with Briand for many years and is able to get along well with him. He is a capable diplomat, so he will certainly be competent for the important task of representing France in Germany. Domestic public opinion is also quite supportive.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 1st: Regarding the United States assisting Germany in restoring its economic situation, it is heard that President Hoover plans to use two major commodities produced in the United States, cotton and wheat, as long-term loans to Germany. Negotiations are currently underway with representatives of the German government, German business representatives, and import merchants. It is also heard that the amount of this loan is approximately 150 million marks, with an interest rate of 4.5%.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 1st: US President Hoover today, through the Ambassador to Germany, suggested to the German government that the United States Federal Farm Board could sell wheat and cotton to Germany on the most favorable terms as an economic aid. The German government has not yet responded, but Stone, the head of the Farm Board, has stated that he is willing to sell wheat and cotton purchased by the price stabilization agency to Germany on credit. The US Farm Board had previously purchased large quantities of wheat and cotton to stabilize market prices and is now urgently seeking a market for them.</p>

<h3 id="e53">Increases Issuance of Large Amount of Banknotes <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Approved by the Treasury</p>
<p>To Meet Market Needs</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 6th: The Treasury yesterday approved the Bank of England to issue £15 million in banknotes, bringing the total amount of banknotes to £27.5 million. This increase was approved for a period of three weeks. This measure is purely a precautionary plan, because the Bank of England, in view of the large demand for gold in the bank, and because public withdrawals of cash have always been higher before and after the August bank holiday, requested an increase in the issuance of banknotes. The Bank of England currently has sufficient deposits to meet ordinary needs, but the planned increase in the issuance of banknotes is not without foresight. Furthermore, the loan arrangements between France, the United States, and the Bank of England are only temporary plans to tide over the difficult period from now until the end of October when Congress reconvenes. Responsible parties hope that by then the government can prove that the budget can be balanced by saving methods.</p>
<p>National News Agency, London, 1st: Today, it was announced simultaneously in London, Paris, and New York that the Bank of France and the US Federal Reserve Bank have agreed to loan £50 million to the Bank of England, to be shared equally by the two banks. This was decided this morning in Paris by the governors of the two banks, and was agreed upon with the New York Federal Reserve Bank via telephone. The British Treasury also announced simultaneously that it had authorized the Bank of England to increase the amount of banknotes issued on credit from £15 million to £27.5 million within three weeks to meet the needs of the financial market in August, because there is no hope of increasing the gold reserves in the bank for the time being. Therefore, the Treasury has authorized an increase in the issuance of banknotes on credit.</p>
<p>Spain Decides to Cancel</p>
<h3 id="e54">Patents Enjoyed by Foreigners <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Britain, the United States, Germany, and France Most Affected</p>
<p>National News Agency, Madrid, 1st: It is reported that all patent rights previously granted by the Rivera Dictatorship to foreign companies will be canceled as soon as possible, because legal experts in the cabinet have petitioned the government, saying that the Rivera Dictatorship had no right to grant all patents to foreigners. Therefore, patents obtained by foreigners are all invalid. Currently, the foreign countries that enjoy patent rights in Spain, such as oil, telephone, navigation, and aviation, will be most affected by the cancellation of patents. The patents of Germany and France are limited to commercial aviation. It is said that after the Spanish government cancels all foreign patent rights, it will inevitably hire a large number of foreign experts to promote all industries and commerce. Currently, public opinion in the country strongly supports the abolition of foreign patents, but there are objections to the hiring of foreign experts, especially from conservative newspapers, because it will harm Spain's reputation in the international community.</p>

<p>Reuters, New York, 1st: A dispatch from the capital of Argentina says that the police searched the Soviet Russian Commercial Office yesterday and detained all 160 employees. Today, another Russian agency was searched. It is said that in addition to dumping activities, the Soviet Russian Commercial Office also engaged in conspiratorial propaganda. According to police authorities, the search was due to the Russians importing large quantities of goods and selling them at half price, making it impossible to sell similar Argentine goods. Police authorities also ordered the confiscation of Russian goods carried by two Norwegian merchant ships.</p>

<p>Shi's Army Dares Not Enter Qingfengdian</p>
<p>Northeast Air Force Achieves Repeated Meritorious Deeds</p>
<p>Yu Xuezhong Says Shi Can Only Flee Eastward</p>
<p>Major Battle Expected Between Wangdu and Qingfengdian</p>
<p>Baoding Correspondence: Shi Yousan's troops of the Pinghan Railway, after being lured by the Northeast Army, entered Shijiazhuang on the 21st. The Northeast Army then retreated step by step, and Shi's troops also advanced gradually. Although Shi's vanguard has crossed Xinle and reached Qingfengdian, Shi's troops, in addition to suffering heavy blows from the air force, have also realized that the Northeast Army's strength in the Wangdu area is formidable and dare not challenge them. Therefore, since the 26th, aerial reconnaissance by the air force has revealed that, apart from about a regiment of Zhang Xuecheng's infantry found in Qingfengdian, there are no traces of Shi's troops. Aerial reconnaissance on the 27th revealed that Shi's troops have dug a trench about five li deep eastward from Qingfengdian. At the eastern end of the trench are four or five villages, and wing-like battlements have been dug around the villages to prevent flank attacks. It seems that they have switched to a defensive posture. In addition, Shi's troops have built a deep trench about thirty to forty li long as their last line of defense from Shijiazhuang to Wuji and Shenze. However, the main force of Shi's troops is nowhere to be found. Around 11 PM on the 26th, more than 400 plainclothes agents appeared in the Qingfengdian area at Shi's front line, conducting harassing operations towards the northeast of Wangdu. The Northeast Army dispatched machine gun teams to sweep them, and simultaneously bombarded them with mortars. Within minutes, they were completely defeated. Previously, the Northeast Army dug trenches thirty-odd li southeastward from the Wangdu railway station, and about seven li westward to the mountain peak. Each trench had two lines, the front trench being eight chi deep and one zhang wide, and the second trench being four chi deep and five chi wide, with communication trenches connecting to the rear. All armies were prepared, with Li Zhentang's troops on the right flank, Du Jiwu in the front, and Chen Guanqun's and Dong Yingbin's brigades distributed on the left flank east of the railway. The cavalry brigade under Bai Fengxiang supported the front and right flanks. The 7th Artillery Brigade was distributed in artillery positions on all fronts. The cavalry of the 2nd Army of the Jinpu Railway has now arrived in Xianxian and Anguo in Hejian Prefecture, connecting with the left flank of the 1st Army of the Pinghan Railway, forming a large fan-shaped solid defense, posing an ambush to Shi's troops. However, in recent days, Shi's troops have not dared to advance lightly on the Pinghan Railway and have switched to a defensive posture. In order to break through Shi's main force as soon as possible, Yu Xuezhong, on the morning of the 27th at about 10 AM, consulted with Zhu Lihan, the Training Director of the Chief Executive's Office dispatched by the Xingying (Provisional Headquarters), Chief of Staff Liu Zhonggan, and Chief of the Staff Office Wen Nianzhong. As a result, starting that day, plainclothes scouts were dispatched to reconnoiter the location of Shi's main force, while aircraft were simultaneously dispatched to assist in reconnaissance. If Shi's troops do not challenge within three days after reconnaissance, the Northeast Army will immediately launch an attack, adopting an emergency pursuit strategy. At that time, Commander Yu will personally go to Fangsheng Bridge to command. When Yu departed, all personnel of the military headquarters, except for a large part remaining in Baoding, were assigned to special trains for mobile operations. Zhu Lihan arrived in Baoding on the 26th, reportedly under the orders of the Deputy Commander, to take on the military liaison mission for the First and Second Armies.</p>
<p>The Northeast Air Force's dispatched task force has been very active in recent days. To avoid bombing, Shi's troops dare not operate during the day. Therefore, the air force task force has changed its strategy. In addition to dispatching planes in different directions for reconnaissance and bombing during the day, they are also conducting night flights. Starting from midnight on the 26th, a French-made 36-hour long-range aircraft was used for the first test flight. The aircraft had lights on both wings and its tail. After taking off from the airport, it circled Baoding city once and then flew south. The aircraft carried four 120-pound incendiary bombs. When it passed the Northeast Army's positions in the Wangdu area, each army burned piles of dry firewood in open spaces to identify them as their own positions. When the aircraft reached Qingfengdian after passing Wangdu, it happened to catch Shi's engineers constructing defensive works with lights. The aircraft dropped three bombs and strafed with machine guns, firing over 700 rounds. All but those killed were scattered. The aircraft then flew south to Shijiazhuang and dropped the remaining two bombs in the city. Flames erupted everywhere. After circling Shijiazhuang several times, it returned to Baoding and landed at about 8 AM on the 27th. Chen Honglu, the commander of the dispatched task force, praised the night air combat as an unprecedented new record in Chinese aviation, with excellent results. Around 11 PM on the night of the 27th, two bomber aircraft were again dispatched, one after the other, to fly to Zhengding and Shijiazhuang to disrupt Shi's rear defenses. The aviation dispatched task force in Baoding, originally attached to the First and Second Air Squadrons, received orders from the Xingying and flew back to Beiping from Baoding in three batches on the morning of the 27th at 5 AM. The first team remained in Baoding, responsible for the Pinghan Railway mission. It is said that the second team will proceed to the Jinpu Railway after arriving in Beiping to cooperate with the Second Army. The air force and artillery have now been ordered to conduct joint air and artillery operations. The method is that each reconnaissance aircraft carries a radio, and the artillery positions are also equipped with radios. The air force reports the location, distance, and direction of the enemy's headquarters and main forces detected in the air to the artillery via radio, and the artillery opens fire for bombardment. The progress of the Northeast Army's tactics in recent years is evident.</p>
<p>On the 27th, Yu Xuezhong told reporters that there have been skirmishes along the Pinghan Railway for days, but no major clashes. Our army's advances and retreats are all in steps. Although there have been some casualties, they are no more than a few people. The front troops in the Wangdu area consist of five brigades, plus one cavalry and one artillery brigade. The Miao Brigade is still in the rear and has not yet arrived. Defensive works have been built in the front. The general attack order will be issued after preparations are complete and the situation of both the enemy and our forces is thoroughly understood. Approximately in a day or two. Shi's troops number no more than 60,000, currently divided into three parts.</p>
<h2>Page 9</h2>
<p>One part is near Handan, numbering about 10,000. Shi Yousan himself is with a part currently in Shijiazhuang, with Shi himself also there. The troops in the north are more numerous, about 40,000, consisting of the four brigades of Sun Guangqian, Shen Keliang, Fang Qi, and Zhang Xuecheng. Most of them are concentrated in Dingzhou. Sun, being a native of Baoding, is familiar with the geography, so his brigade is at the forefront, expanding to both the left and right. However, the easternmost point only reaches Jin County. West of the town road, there are few of Shi's troops. Their line of defense is T-shaped, with a strong front and a weak rear. If the eastern and western routes carry out a pincer attack, Shi's troops will have no choice but to collapse towards the Linqing and Dezhou area in northern Shandong, and may be reorganized by Chairman Han upon instructions from the central government. There is absolutely no way to go to Shanxi. Further south, there are the Central Army and Liu Guitang's troops, so there is really no refuge other than northern Shandong. Currently, on the Jinpu front, our troops are mostly concentrated in Cangzhou, with a total of four infantry brigades, two cavalry brigades, and two artillery regiments. The cavalry has already bypassed the forward troops, launching a coordinated attack, etc.</p>
<p>Previously, Shi's troops had used Shunde as their main location. From Shunde to Shijiazhuang is only 230 li. Now Shi's troops will use Shijiazhuang as their base camp. Shijiazhuang and Baoding are about 250 li apart. South of Baoding along the railway are Yujiazhuang, Fangsheng Bridge, and Wangdu County. Currently, on the northern section of the Pinghan Railway, trains from Beiping only reach Baoding. Baoding to Wangdu has military communication trains extending to Yangqi outside Wangdu. However, there is only one transportation route, where the main force of the Northeast Army is located. South of Wangdu is Qingfengdian, where there are occasional small skirmishes. This place is about to become a major battlefield. Qingfengdian is feared to be transformed to a bloody place. Further south are Dingzhou, Zhaixidian, and Xinle stations. This section, to Xinle, Zhengding, Hutuo River, Yuanshi, Gaoyi, Dachenzhuang, and Fengcun Bridge south of Shijiazhuang, has been destroyed. Seven spans of the Zhengding Bridge's eighteen spans have been damaged. The Xinle Bridge is even more important. After the cessation of hostilities, restoration will be difficult. Wangdu to Baoding is about ninety-odd li, so in the deep of the night, the sound of artillery can be faintly heard in Baoding city. However, the defenses in this section are very solid, and Shi's troops will hardly cross this Rubicon. (July 28th)</p>
<p>After the Fall of Donggu:</p>
<h3 id="e61">Zhu De Flees to Ruijin Wounded <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Remaining Red Bandits Gather in Xingguo and Yudu</p>
<p>Troops Continue to Search and Suppress Remaining Bandits Separately</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: When the suppression army besieged Donggu, most of the Red Bandits hid in deep mountains and dense forests, attempting to evade annihilation. The suppression army then set fire to the mountains, causing the Red Bandits to flee in all directions. The left and right wings then took advantage of the momentum and advanced sharply, capturing Donggu. The whereabouts of the bandit leaders Zhu, Mao, Peng, and Huang are unknown. In recent days, various units have been searching for scattered bandits near Donggu. According to captured bandits and locals, it has been learned that Zhu De was also wounded and fled to Ruijin. The headquarters received many reports on the 29th (yesterday) regarding Zhu's wounded escape: (1) Mao Weishou of the 60th Division reported that Tian Fu carried a stretcher from Donggu on the afternoon of the 26th, with over 300 guards before and after, many carrying pistols. It was later learned that the wounded person was Zhu De. (2) Jiang Dingwen reported that on the 27th (yesterday), over 200 remnants were found in various villages near Sanzhai (the border between Xingguo Gulonggang south and Yudu). According to their statements, they all said that Zhu De was seriously wounded and they no longer wished to follow, so they hid in Sanzhai. (3) The Magistrate of Huichang County reported that Zhu De was indeed seriously wounded and has now fled to the territory of Ruijin County, with over a thousand exhausted bandits, many unarmed. Although the county only has 200 local militia guns, they are holding the strategic points and can block the bandits. However, to eradicate the evil, it is requested to quickly dispatch a large army to pursue and eliminate this menace as soon as possible. From this, it can be known that Zhu's injury is likely credible.</p>
<p>According to front-line news, approximately tens of thousands of Red Bandit remnants fled from Donggu and are now gathered between Yudu and Xingguo. The bandits defeated earlier in Lichuan and Shicheng have gathered in Ruijin. Xiang Ying's band is hiding in Naoziling Mountain, a hundred-odd li from Huichang, at the border of Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Fujian. Therefore, the suppression army is continuing to search and suppress separately. The right-wing divisions are focusing on attacking Xingguo, which should be captured during the day. The central and left-wing armies are using one part to search for scattered bandits in the mountains of Donggu, and another part to pursue and suppress bandits in Ruijin and Yudu, in order to clear the remnants of the Red Bandits as soon as possible. Furthermore, according to aircraft reports, most of the bandits in Ruijin have moved west from Jiubao, attempting to connect with the bandits in Yudu and then flee to Huichang to move towards the Jiangxi-Guangdong-Fujian border. However, the Red Bandits are currently breaking into smaller units. In recent days, Luo Zhuoying's troops encountered over a thousand men from the 9th Division of the 3rd Puppet Army in Yuexi, defeating them and seizing over 200 guns and a bundle of puppet Workers' and Peasants' Bank notes, which were immediately burned. Zhu Shaoliang's troops searched for over 500 Red Bandits in the Fangshan Xiaoyuan area, and found over 600 guns buried in the mountains of Eshan and Jiushan. Zhao Guantao's division encountered over 700 scattered bandits in Shirenling and captured them all, executing dozens of the ringleaders with the most heinous crimes and sending the rest to the rear for disposal. Sun Lianzhong, Cai Tingkai, and other units encountered small groups of two to four hundred Red Bandits in Nantuan, Tongluowei, and other places, eliminating them all. Therefore, it is expected that the remaining Red Bandits can be cleared up soon. (July 30th)</p>
<h3 id="e62">An Investigation into the Korean Incident (Continued) <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>The Details of Tragedies in Other Areas: The anti-Chinese riots by Koreans this time have swept through the three Hans (Korea), but the most severe tragedies occurred in Pyongyang, Incheon, Gyeongseong (Seoul), Wonsan, and Busan. The next most severe were in places such as Zhennampo, Sinuiju, Hamhung, Haeju, and Seocheon. The riot in Wonsan began at 7 PM on July 5th. Koreans rang the fire department's alarm bells as a signal, gathering in one place and attacking Chinese barber shops, food stalls, and restaurants. One group of Koreans smashed doors, windows, and equipment, while another group sought out Chinese to beat. Although Japanese police were stationed throughout the streets, they did not stop the attacks. Chinese who were beaten fled to the consulate, where they were taken in by the consulate and the Chamber of Commerce. By the morning of the 6th, over 2,000 people had been taken in. At noon on the 6th, Koreans planned to surround and attack the consulate to beat the Chinese, but fortunately, the consulate requested the Japanese police station to send a large contingent of police to provide strict protection, thus averting danger. By the evening of the 8th, over a hundred Chinese shops had been ransacked and over seventy vegetable gardens had been destroyed. The Chinese were sheltered until the 11th, when they left the consulate. The local Chamber of Commerce prepared funds to negotiate transport to Gyeongseong at half price, and then transferred to Incheon to return to China. The riot in Zhennampo began at 8 PM on July 6th, starting from the western end of the Korean street. Over a thousand Koreans first attacked a Chinese barber shop. As more people gathered, they attacked other streets, breaking into Chinese shops and ransacking them. Those who found Chinese were beaten by the crowd, injuring over a dozen people. It was reported that Chinese vegetable gardens outside the street were also attacked by Koreans, who set fire to houses and caused the Chinese to flee in all directions. Japanese police transported the Chinese in cars to the consulate for temporary refuge. By the morning of the 7th, there were already over a thousand refugees. By the morning of the 8th, five larger Chinese businesses and over a hundred restaurants and food stalls had been smashed. Among them, 30% lost all their goods, and 70% suffered partial losses. The Chinese residents gathered in the consulate began to leave on the 11th to return to their home countries. Those who could not immediately leave were forced to resume business by Japanese police on July 22nd, so only about twenty businesses are currently open. The riot in Sinuiju began on the evening of July 7th. Although there were many Chinese residents in the area, it was separated from Andong by a river. Before the Korean riot on the evening of the 7th, some people who had prior knowledge crossed to Andong, while others sought refuge in the consulate. The Japanese police station, due to its location on the border between the two countries, was unwilling to overemphasize its shortcomings, so its protection was relatively strong. Only a few doors and windows of over a hundred shops in the city were smashed, resulting in little loss. The riot ended at noon on the 8th. The riot was most intense on the island in the center of the Yalu River, where over twenty Chinese food stalls and restaurants were completely destroyed. Yu Fu, a clerk at the Fushengquan food stall, also 42 years old, died from a head injury caused by a large stone. About fourteen people were injured. In addition, riots occurred in Yushan and Beizhen within Sinuiju on the evening of the 7th at 10 PM, with seven shops being smashed and ten people injured. In Yudong, a riot occurred at 6 PM on the evening of the 7th, injuring twenty-eight people and destroying eleven vegetable gardens. The riot in Seocheon occurred at 10 AM on the 4th, smashing six large shops and injuring five people. The riot in Jeongju occurred at 10 PM on the 6th, smashing five shops and injuring over twenty people. The riot in Namsi occurred at 7 PM on the 6th, smashing eight large businesses and seven vegetable gardens. The riot in Susi occurred at 2 AM on the morning of the 7th, injuring seven people and smashing ten shops. The riot in Guseong occurred at 6 PM on the afternoon of the 7th, injuring three people and smashing four shops. The riot in Bocheon occurred at 7 AM on the 6th, destroying eleven vegetable gardens, smashing six shops, and injuring fourteen people. Riots also occurred in Nyungbyun, Uiju Ganggye, Jaseong, Heecheon, Hamhung, and Haeju, with similar patterns. However, this only applies to the Pyongan North and South provinces, Hwanghae Province, Gyeonggi Province, Gangwon Province, and Daeseongjin. As for the Hamgyong North and South provinces and other provinces (Korea has a total of eight provinces), no details have been obtained. In short, there is no place in Korea without traces of Chinese residents. The exact number of people and population is unknown, and the number of deaths, injuries, and damages is also only an estimate. The above riots were most damaging to shops in Korean streets, and less so in Japanese streets. In every Korean city, due to the natural tendencies of the ethnic groups, there are distinct Korean and Japanese residential areas that do not mix. In this Korean riot, Chinese businesses near Japanese businesses were protected by the Japanese businesses. The Koreans feared harming the Japanese (killing a rat near a vase), so they were somewhat preserved, otherwise, they would have inevitably been completely destroyed.</p>
<p>An Overview of the Losses: The losses of Chinese businesses in various places can be divided into direct and indirect losses. Direct losses are those caused by the immediate smashing, while indirect losses are those caused by the closure of businesses after the riot. For direct losses, only Incheon has obtained figures, while other places have not yet started. For indirect losses, there are no statistics for any place. Based on the situation, the direct losses in Pyongyang were heavier than in any other place. Over ten large businesses, with capital of 200,000 (Japanese yen), were completely destroyed. Their debts cannot be recovered due to the destruction of the account books. Although the Japanese side ordered local Chinese businesses to reconcile accounts with debtors, cunning debtors either did not acknowledge the debts at all, or acknowledged only a small amount, claiming that the Chinese businesses had lost their evidence. Therefore, the direct losses of these ten-odd large businesses in Pyongyang are already around three million yuan. Including the 300-odd small businesses and 60-odd vegetable gardens, the losses are estimated to be over five million. Indirect losses are not yet included. In other places, direct losses are lighter than indirect losses. The losses in Incheon are estimated to be around 400,000. The direct and indirect losses in Gyeongseong, Sinuiju, and Zhennampo are estimated to be around 500,000 each. The losses in Wonsan and Busan are estimated to be around 300,000 each. According to last year's survey, there are over 300,000 Chinese residents in Korea. Calculated per person, the direct and indirect losses are estimated to be over 20 million. Among them, merchants account for 60%, farmers (vegetable growers) account for 30%, and laborers account for 10%. After this attack, the savings of Chinese residents accumulated over many years have been almost completely lost. Those who were fortunate enough not to be destroyed, or whose destruction was lighter, will also find it difficult to sustain due to the sluggish business.</p>
<p>Investigation of Deaths and Injuries in Various Places: Regarding deaths and injuries, the number of injuries in Pyongyang is unknown based on the survey, but the number of deaths is 126. A detailed table has been prepared based on the Chamber of Commerce's investigation. Detailed tables have also been prepared for the investigation of deaths and injuries in Incheon and Gyeongseong. The numbers and names of those in Zhennampo and Sinuiju have not yet been compiled. The tables are as follows:</p>

<p>The Future Crisis of Overseas Chinese: The history of overseas Chinese in Korea dates back hundreds of years. The peak was when Korea was subservient to the former Qing Dynasty. After the Sino-Japanese War, as Japanese power expanded, overseas Chinese, unaccustomed to the bullying of the Japanese and Koreans, gradually left. In recent years, many laborers have found it easy to make a living there, and the wages were several times higher than in China, so more have gone there. Engaging in business and growing vegetables are mostly those who have resided there for many years, while laborers come and go every year. Therefore, they can be broadly divided into permanent residents and short-term residents. Among the overseas Chinese, those from Shandong account for 95 percent, while those from Guangdong and the three northeastern provinces account for 5 percent. Among the overseas Chinese from Shandong, those from the Shandong Peninsula, such as Fushan, Wenyi, and Laiyang counties, are particularly numerous. The reasons for this are: first, the distance between Shandong's Zhifu and Incheon, Korea, is only across a strait, which can be reached by boat in one day and night; second, the people of the Shandong Peninsula are known for their strength and seafaring skills, and they regard living abroad as a common occurrence, and they are also more diligent and hardworking, so they have found a unique way of life overseas. In major ports such as Beijing (Seoul), Pyongyang, Incheon, and Wonsan, many Chinese businessmen have worked hard to accumulate wealth and regard Korea as their second home. As Japan manages Korea, it will not tolerate snoring beside its bed. The reason why overseas Chinese have been able to gain a foothold and share a piece of the pie is due to several special strengths: (1) Vegetable cultivation is the unique skill of the people of Shandong. Radishes, cabbages, turnips, and winter mushrooms, all herbaceous horticulture, Shandong overseas Chinese can handle with ease. Growing melons yields melons. When Japanese and Koreans do it, they are either infertile or withered. To this end, the Japanese government has tried to promote research, but in the end, it cannot compare to our experienced gardeners, so they have to allow us to live there. (2) Chinese cuisine is delicious and has a wide variety. Beijing cuisine is especially favored by Japanese and Koreans. Chinese restaurants are located in various ports. The large restaurants in Beijing, such as Penglaige, Sihailou, Daguan Garden, and Yaxulou, are elegant and clean, and the dishes are exquisite. Japanese and Koreans eat there in the hundreds every day. "Zhaba Cai Liang Zhang Pi" (stir-fried meat and bean jelly) is especially favored by Japanese and Koreans, so in the four major ports of Beijing, Incheon, Busan, there are more than a hundred large and small restaurants, and life is quite prosperous. In order to satisfy their appetites, the Japanese and Koreans have to allow overseas Chinese to gain a foothold there. (3) Shandong pancakes and steamed buns are fragrant, sweet, easy to chew, and filling, and are favored by laborers. In general, overseas Chinese account for most of the food shops in Korea. The plaques of Chinese steamed buns are placed in bustling city centers. This is the same as restaurants, and the Japanese and Koreans cannot eliminate them. (4) Chinese people are hardworking and able to endure hardship. In business, credit comes first. Banks in Korea are more willing to lend funds to fake Chinese than to fake Japanese and Koreans. Chinese people tend to pay back the principal quickly when they have a surplus, and there are never any cases of defaulting on debts. This has a deep relationship with local profit-making institutions and is maintained by ordinary banks, which do not want the government to exclude them. At the same time, Chinese shops are convenient to support and sell goods cheaply. For the same goods, Japanese merchants sell for one yuan, Korean merchants sell for ninety cents, and Chinese merchants sell for only seventy or eighty cents. Therefore, Koreans purchase most of their daily necessities from Chinese merchants, so Chinese merchants in Korea have the function of regulating the level of life and stabilizing prices, and are relied upon by the majority of Koreans. Deeply rooted.</p>
<h3 id="e66">One of the shops destroyed in Zhennampo <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>It is difficult to eradicate. However, since this riot, the timid have returned to China one after another, and although the brave still remain, they are also actively cleaning up everything in preparation for returning to China. Before the riot, there were about 300,000 overseas Chinese in Korea, but according to current statistics, there are less than 50,000. Those who have gone in the past cannot live in peace and engage in business, and those who will come in the future are frightened by this incident and dare not go again. And because the Japanese and Koreans jointly boycott Chinese merchants, do not buy Chinese merchants' goods, and do not use Chinese workers. The Chinese cuisine that they used to like to eat is said to be poisoned by Chinese people for revenge, so all industries have plummeted. Although some have resumed business now, I am afraid it will be difficult to last.</p>
<p>Inadequacy of Consular Personnel: The location of our diplomatic officials stationed in Korea: (1) There is a consulate general in Beijing (Seoul), with one consul general, one deputy consul general, two consuls, one assistant consul and one chief clerk; (2) There is a consulate in Sinuiju, with one consul, one deputy consul and one chief clerk each; (3) There is a vice consulate in Wonsan, with one vice consul and one chief clerk; (4) In Busan</p>
<h3 id="e67">Two of the shops destroyed in Zhennampo <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>There is a consulate with one consul, one deputy consul and one chief clerk; (5) There is a vice consulate in Zhennampo, with one vice consul and one clerk; (6) There is an office of the consulate general in Incheon, with one director and one clerk each. Consuls in various places are not affiliated with each other, and each seeks their own way in case of trouble. Among them, there are some who are proficient in Japanese and understand the situation in Japan and Korea, but there are also many who are not very familiar with the language. Before the incident, the Beijing Daily published news about Wanbaoshan, stimulating the Koreans, and on July 2nd and 3rd, the Korean Daily News issued extra editions indiscriminately. Zhang Weicheng, the consul general stationed in Beijing, turned a blind eye and did not protest to the Japanese side to request the cessation of the news, and was also indifferent to the safety of overseas Chinese. After the incident, he was forced by the Beijing General Chamber of Commerce to protest to the Japanese Governor-General's Office. After the incident subsided, he has not yet investigated the number of losses and casualties. What makes the overseas Chinese most dissatisfied is that he seized功劳without labor, bragging about himself in domestic newspapers, how he protested, how he negotiated. Zhang was ordered by the ministry in June of this year to be transferred to the ministry to take up a position, and Lu Chunfang, who succeeded him as the consul general in India, has been late in arriving in Korea. The general overseas Chinese recognize that their own safety is at stake, but Consul General Zhang is mindful of his short-term post and does not care about it. Even if he has not tried to negotiate, even if he negotiates, the Japanese side may not pay attention. However, the principle of diplomatic officials is that they must do their best. Not only that, but Li Zhonggang, the chief clerk of the Consulate General, usually set up his own business and was incompatible with Zhang Weicheng Jida (deputy consul), often scolding him in public. On July 5th, at the time of the Beijing Riot, more than 4,000 overseas Chinese took refuge in the Consulate General. Li gave a speech in public, saying that Zhang Weicheng had betrayed the country, and led a group of ignorant overseas Chinese to take up arms to beat Zhang Ji and others. After the Chamber of Commerce people persuaded them in every way, they stopped. This incident occurred under the protection of a large number of Japanese police, which was extremely shameful to the country. Therefore, the knowledgeable overseas Chinese regard it as a great pain. Pyongyang belongs to the consular jurisdiction of Zhennampo. On the evening of the 4th, local businessmen heard the news and reported it to the Zhennampo Consulate by telephone. Vice Consul Xu Yuanda said that the 5th was a Sunday and he could not handle the matter, and promised to go to Pyongyang on the 6th. On the 6th, the second tragedy began. Xu arrived in Pyongyang from Zhennampo, and was warned by the Japanese that Pyongyang was dangerous. Xu did not get out of the car, but hastily returned in the original car. It was not until July 8th, after Pyongyang suffered its third catastrophe, that he came. At that time, the chaotic situation in the streets had not yet been cleaned up, and the bodies of the overseas Chinese who had died tragically were still lying across the streets unburied. If Xu were bold enough to walk around for a week, he would have at least obtained some evidence that could be used for future negotiations. But Xu was as timid as a mouse, and only went to the shelter and the hospital for a look before returning to Zhennampo in a hurry. He did not pay attention to how to negotiate or how to deal with the aftermath. This is what all the overseas Chinese in Korea hate the most, and they believe that Xu alone was responsible for the Koreans being able to commit violence three times. Among the general consuls, those who are more responsible are Zhu Fu of Sinuiju and Jiang Wencheng of Incheon, who are willing to negotiate before and after the event, regardless of difficulties. It is thanks to this that the overseas Chinese were able to preserve some of their property. Gong Heting, chairman of the Beijing General Chamber of Commerce, Zhou Jingen, chairman of the North Gang Chamber of Commerce, Fu Weigong, chairman of the Incheon Chamber of Commerce, standing committee member Wang Baozhen, and staff and members of the Beijing Party Department risked their lives to rescue the overseas Chinese, resisted the Japanese authorities, and after the event, they rescued the distressed overseas Chinese and sent them back to China. Their enthusiasm and perseverance were admired by the general public. The staff of the Pyongyang Chamber of Commerce were like a plate of loose sand, and Chairman Meng Xianshi was also muddleheaded. If Gong Heting and Fu Weigong were in Pyongyang, they could have reduced some of the damage. In the future, the government may not want Chinese to reside in Korea, but if it does, it must strengthen the consular defenses, and also guide or select general chamber of commerce officials, so that they can help each other in the event of trouble. As for the expenses of the various consulates, they have been in arrears for several months, so that the general foreign officials are hungry and must serve the public. On the day of the event, even if they wanted to send a telegram, they had no money to do so. The consulate buildings, only the one in Sinuiju is barely acceptable, and the rest are mostly dilapidated and dilapidated. The foreign affairs office is related to the face of the country. If it is not repaired like this, how can it prevent people from despising it? The buildings of the Consulate General in Beijing are spacious and served as the residence of the Qing Dynasty's Minister to Korea. Today, dozens of rear buildings have collapsed. Climbing to the rooftop garden of the nearby Mitsukoshi, looking down, one cannot help but feel emotional.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Another Batch of Refugees from Korea <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<h3 id="e69">Seeking Refuge in Andong <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Coming from Gangwon Province and other places</p>
<p>Andong Communication: More than 3,000 disaster-stricken compatriots from Korea who had taken refuge in Andong were previously accommodated here and have been successively dispersed in the past few days, and the refugee shelter has been effectively closed. Unexpectedly, the Chamber of Commerce received a telegram from the Chinese Chambers of Commerce in Pyongyang and Wonsan on the morning of the 26th, saying that there were more than 400 disaster-stricken compatriots who would soon go to Andong. Upon hearing the news, the Public Security Bureau immediately sent people to wait at the station. At 8:00 PM on the 26th, 43 refugees from Pyongyang arrived, and at 7:00 AM on the 27th, another 426 refugees from Wonsan fled here. The local authorities immediately sent personnel to compile the numbers according to their names and led them to rest in the former No. 1 refugee shelter, Dan Gui Stage, and provided food and protection as before. The donations from all walks of life totaled more than 16,000 yuan, and there is still more than 4,000 yuan left after deducting the expenses, so it is still sufficient to meet the needs. Zhang Hanwei, the director of the Commercial Port Public Security Bureau, went to the refugee shelter twice on the afternoon of the 27th to express his condolences to the refugees and inquired in detail about the situation when they were in distress in Korea. According to the refugees, they were all laborers who used to work as road repairmen, hawkers, and vegetable growers in the Gangwon Province area. In this change, although the disaster in Gangwon Province was relatively light, the actual damage and losses suffered were also huge. No less than 20 or 30 Chinese people in remote areas were beaten to death by thugs. Unfortunately, there were fewer overseas Chinese there, and the Chinese people rarely pay attention to it, so the country is probably still unaware of these dead compatriots. They also said that after being driven out of Gangwon Province, they took the opportunity to flee to Wonsan for refuge. They were given food by the local Chinese Chamber of Commerce, so they were able to survive. They originally planned to return to their old places after the four borders were slightly calmed down. Unexpectedly, they recently heard rumors that the Korean people were preparing to start another incident on the 30th to expel them. Hearing the news, they were even more shocked, so they decided to return to their country. Fortunately, the two Chambers of Commerce in Wonsan and Pyongyang provided them with travel expenses, so they were able to escape to Andong. According to this, the situation in Korea is indeed not completely settled. Most of these refugees are from Hebei and Shandong. Soon, they will either move to other ports to find work or return to their hometowns. The authorities have prepared travel expenses and will properly distribute them. (28th)</p>

<p>Tianjin Communication: After Shi Yousan's mutiny, the Northeast authorities paid close attention to the actions of politicians and military personnel in the opposition, in order to prevent them from starting a political storm and making the overall situation even more chaotic. Ding Chungao has the closest relationship with Feng Yuxiang. In the past, he repeatedly served as Feng's representative to contact various parties. In 1928, Ding served as a member of the Hebei Provincial Government. Last year, when Feng failed, Ding resigned. He often traveled between Beijing and Tianjin. As the situation in the north became tense, Ding's actions were noticed by the authorities. Last week, Ding went from Tianjin to Beijing. Plainclothes detectives followed him. When the car arrived at the Qianmendong Station, the detectives called the police and arrested him together with the military police. However, since the Northeast and Northwest are currently promoting unity, he was released the next day after various parties interceded by letters and telegrams. Nan Guixin, the first mayor of Tianjin Special City, has some origins with Yan Xishan. Yesterday morning (27th), Nan and his two sons and two servants arrived in Tianjin by Train No. 202. Nan has been retired for several years. During this turbulent time in the north, his sudden arrival was also noticed by the detectives. After Nan got off the train, he visited old friends of the Jin faction everywhere. The detectives became even more suspicious. In the afternoon at 4:00 PM, Mr. Nan and his sons and servants went to the Dong Station again and boarded Train No. 10 to Beijing. The detectives then reported to the 10th Squadron of the Military Police, and the squadron sent plainclothes military police Li Jingxing and Guan Yuxiu to board the train and arrest Nan at 4:20 PM. He was handed over to the 10th Squadron's general station branch, where Chief Wang Linshu interrogated him. Mr. Nan confessed that he was currently serving as a consultant to the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force (and produced a letter of appointment from Commander-in-Chief Chiang as proof). He said that he had been summoned to Beijing by Mr. Zhang Puquan, a member of the Central Supervisory Committee. Wang knew that it was a mistaken arrest, but he did not dare to release him, and urgently telegraphed to the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Military Police in Beiping for instructions. The reply telegraphed ordered him to be sent to the Tianjin Garrison Command for disposal. At 5:30 PM, he was sent to the Garrison Command, which urgently telegraphed to the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force's Executive Office for instructions. Then, Zhu Guangmu, the Director of the General Affairs Office, telegraphed Zhang Ji for inquiries. Zhang replied that he had indeed telegraphed Mr. Nan to come to Beijing and guaranteed that Mr. Nan had nothing to do with the current situation in the north. The Deputy Commander-in-Chief then telegraphed back to order his immediate release. At 8:30 PM, Mr. Nan regained his freedom. The Garrison Command, fearing that he would be arrested again by detectives on the way, specially sent Liu Baohe, the Chief of Investigation of the First District Public Security Bureau, to escort him, and he boarded Train No. 4 to Beijing at 9:00 PM.

<p>All circles decide to establish a relief committee</p>
<p>Nanshan Road will temporarily resume passenger cars first</p>
<p>Jiujiang Communication: The Huangdi Embankment in Jiangbei, Jiujiang, is a barrier to prevent flooding in the 9th District of the county and Susong in Anhui, Huangmei in Hubei, and Guangji. Recently, the river water has risen sharply. The last line of defense of the embankment, Panxing圩, collapsed for more than 40 feet at Yangjiatang at 1:00 AM on the 1st of this month. The river water was more than 3 feet higher than the fields in the 圩, and it poured straight down like a waterfall. Countless people and animals were drowned. More than 54,000 acres of farmland belonging to Jiujiang were flooded. The loss of rice, cotton, soybeans and other property is estimated at 500,000 yuan. At 1:00 PM on the 1st, all circles here held an emergency meeting and decided to establish a Jiujiang Flood Relief Committee on the 2nd. The Chamber of Commerce will advance 2,000 yuan to handle emergency relief. Refugee shelters will be set up in the three places of Doutian Temple, Dongyue Temple, and Nengren Temple, and a temporary cattle mortgage office will be set up to raise the cattle brought out by the victims. In the future, they will be allowed to pay the borrowed money and take back the original cattle. Because unscrupulous merchants are manipulating the value, a cow worth 70 or 80 yuan can only be sold for 15 or 16 yuan.</p>
<p>The Nanshan Railway was suspended from traffic on the 27th of last month due to the damage caused to the roadbed and bridges by the water. According to the railway bureau's investigation, the water depth on the track from Jiujiang Station to 3 miles and 40 chain的地方 is more than 1 foot, the water depth from 25 miles and 20 chain to 60 chain is more than 2 feet, the道台 at 29 miles collapsed more than 60 feet, and the bridges at 42, 58, 61, 82 and 83 and other numbers were either damaged by the water or submerged by the water, and the situation was very dangerous. In particular, near Yongxiu Station, more than 30 feet of the roadbed earthwork was washed away by the water, and the sleepers and tracks were overturned by the water. The Railway Bureau has ordered workers to rush to repair the road, and it will take at least 5 days to fully resume traffic. In order to facilitate passengers, the bureau has resumed passenger trains from Jiujiang to Nanshan on the 1st of this month. The trains will run once a day at 9:00 AM in sections. Those departing from Jiujiang Station will only go to Yongxiu. There is a springboard at Yongxiu to Tujiapu, a small station 35 miles away. Passengers must walk past, and then change cars at Jianjiapu and drive to Nanchang. The same applies to those departing from Nanchang. Each passenger is only allowed to bring four pieces of luggage, otherwise the railway bureau will not be responsible for overloading. In addition, the Jiujiang Electric Light Company has been out of power since the 27th of last month due to the submergence of the machinery, and it has not yet been restored. (2nd)</p>
<h3 id="e73">Anhui Provincial Government Decides to Re-establish Relief Committee <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Various Counties Continue to Telegraph Disaster Conditions Daily</p>
<p>Anqing Correspondence: The magnitude of the flood disaster in Anhui Province is unprecedented in decades. More than 40 counties have telegraphed the province to report the disaster. Therefore, at the regular meeting of the Provincial Government on July 31st, the Department of Civil Affairs proposed to re-establish the Provincial Relief Committee as before due to the severe flood disaster in the province. After deliberation, it was decided to adopt the proposal. It is said that the committee will be restored soon. The Provincial Government has received telegrams from various counties reporting the disaster for several consecutive days, roughly as follows: (1) The Xuancheng Emergency Flood Relief Committee telegraphed on the 30th, stating that only the First Jinbao Embankment in Xuancheng remains. It was breached recently, causing great disorder. They urgently request assistance to maintain the current situation. (2) The Langxi Construction Bureau and other groups telegraphed on the 26th, stating that the flood disaster in the county is extremely severe, the worst in 60 years. Six zhang of the city wall have collapsed, the county office is two chi deep in water, the river has overflowed the embankment, and all the crops have been submerged. The bureau and other groups are distributing bread, building reed sheds, and rescuing the people, but it is a drop in the bucket and difficult to cover everyone. They earnestly request that the authorities promptly send relief for emergency distribution to save the lives of all the people. (3) Jiang Shuxun, the Magistrate of Xuyi County, telegraphed on the 29th, stating that after continuous heavy rain, mountain torrents erupted. All four townships of Xuyi County have become a watery expanse, with fields and houses submerged and countless elderly and children dead or injured. Such a catastrophe is too tragic to describe. Local representatives have been selected to go to Beijing and the province to request emergency relief. Furthermore, bandit activity has disrupted transportation in remote areas. It is extremely difficult to collect the second installment of land tax in advance. With no income, it is impossible to maintain the current situation. They specifically request that the allocation of military expenses from the county be temporarily suspended. (4) The Hefei County Party Headquarters and others telegraphed on the 30th, stating that Hefei is unfortunately afflicted by a sudden mountain torrent. The county seat has completely become a watery expanse. All the embankments have been breached, and fields, houses, and dwellings have been washed away. The death toll of people and livestock in urban and rural areas is especially difficult to count. This catastrophic disaster is rarely seen in a century. In addition to the establishment of a flood relief committee by various groups to actively seek relief, they earnestly request sympathy for the disaster victims and a grant of relief, as well as exemption from land tax to alleviate the calamity. (5) Zhou Chongyi, the Magistrate of Quanjiao County, telegraphed on the 27th, stating that after days of heavy rain, the mountain torrents erupted again, and the water level rose several chi higher than before. The severity of the disaster is beyond description. The entire county government is submerged in water, and many houses have collapsed. In addition to borrowing the Chamber of Commerce as an office location and further investigating and reporting on the disaster, they first telegraphed the report. (6) Chen Jiting, the Magistrate of Su County, telegraphed on the 26th, stating that since the beginning of summer, the county has suffered hailstorms and now a flood disaster. The crops have been completely destroyed, and houses, livestock, and people have been washed away. Thousands of refugees have been displaced and are starving. They earnestly request approval to allocate emergency relief and send personnel to investigate and save the people. (7) Luo Wei, the Magistrate of Fengyang County, telegraphed on the 26th, stating that the Huai River embankment in the county has completely breached, with tens of thousands of disaster victims displaced. Please allocate a large sum for emergency relief. (8) The Susong County Party Headquarters and others telegraphed on the 27th, stating that after ten days of continuous rain in Susong, the rice crops in bud have been completely washed away. More than 20 villages in the southeast are trapped by the river tide on the outside and by the accumulated water on the inside. The people's embankments have breached, creating a vast expanse of water. It is still necessary to urgently protect the river embankment to save lives. It is still raining heavily, and mountain torrents are overflowing, causing houses to collapse and creating a scene of widespread misery. Please provide emergency relief to save the people.

I immediately dispatched Guiqi and Hekou's Sun and Yu battalions, who rushed to attack at night, and also ordered the Hu militia to encircle and suppress Yangcun from Zixi. When they arrived at Yangcun, it was already late at night, and the bandits were sound asleep. My troops stormed into the bandit stronghold, killing over a hundred men with broadswords. The bandits, awakened in surprise, abandoned their equipment and fled in panic. At dawn the next day, they launched a counterattack against us. At this time, my Hu militia had also arrived, launching an attack from both the front and rear. After more than five hours of fierce fighting, the bandits began to scatter. Over 800 bandits were killed on the spot, and over 400 rifles, over 50 Mauser rifles, and over 10 horses were seized. In addition, over 60 wives of Zou, Hu, and other key bandit leaders were captured and executed on the spot. Countless other stolen goods were seized.

Wang Diqing of Zhujing, at the instigation of his mother, Wang Tao, ordered the male servant Xia Aqing and the female servant Xiao Mama to strangle Wang Diqing to death on the night of the fifth day of the fifth lunar month. After Liu Cheng, the judge of Jinshan County Government, began investigating on June 21, he suspected Wang Tao and others. According to public opinion, Wang Tao had an adulterous relationship with the accountant Wang Yutian, which was discovered by Diqing, leading to several conflicts. Wang Tao also restricted Diqing's spending. Therefore, the county government investigated along this line of inquiry. Although Wang Yutian fled upon hearing the news, Xiao Mama confessed first after six investigations, stating that she acted on the orders of her mistress, Wang Tao. That evening at 7:00 PM, Xia Aqing strangled Diqing with a rope around his neck to make it look like a suicide. After the facts of the case were fully revealed, Wang Tao and Xia Aqing knew that denial was useless and confessed. Subsequently, a public debate was held on July 18, with hundreds of spectators crowding the venue. Recently, Judge Liu Cheng, accompanied by Secretary Shen, went to the court to announce the verdict. All the defendants stood solemnly before the court. Judge Liu Cheng read the main text, stating that Wang Tao and Xia Aqing were sentenced to death for premeditated murder, and Xiao Mama was sentenced to 12 years of imprisonment. After hearing the verdict, Wang Tao and Xia Aqing looked pale, drooping their heads in disappointment. Xiao Mama knelt and begged for a lighter sentence, tears streaming down her face. The court was then adjourned, and the defendants were ordered to be returned to custody. The tragic case of filicide that shocked the region came to an end.</p>

<p>Disputes Over Protecting and Opening the Embankment Continue. Recently, many places have suffered from flood disasters, but the areas along the canal and Xiangxia River are particularly dangerous. The water level at Sangu Dike in Jiangdu has reached two zhang two chi one cun. Chushan Dike near Shaobo was opened yesterday (29th). The Jiangdu section of the Lianhe Engineering Office has raised and reinforced the Shahe Dike outside Dongguan to temporarily maintain the current situation. However, in the Gaoyou and Yiying area, the water level is very dangerous, and people are preparing boats for evacuation. The water at the Yumadun in Gaoyou has exceeded the water mark of the opening of the Loba Dike in the Republic of China, making it imperative to open the dike. Therefore, the people of the counties mostly advocate for immediate opening. However, in the Xiangxia River area, the autumn harvest season is approaching. If the dike is opened, the water flowing into the Xiahe River from upstream will not easily flow into the sea, and houses and crops will be destroyed. Therefore, it is advocated to delay the opening. Currently, the two factions of protecting and opening the dike have gathered in Gaoyou and are arguing fiercely.</p>

<p>Ningbo Chamber of Commerce's Statement Regarding the Inspection of Ship Passengers. The Ningbo General Chamber of Commerce, regarding the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau's forced vaccination of passengers on ships from Ningbo to Shanghai, in conjunction with the National Seaport Quarantine Office, sent a letter to the Shanghai Health Bureau and the National Seaport Quarantine Office yesterday. The letter stated that preventive vaccination is a matter of hygiene and is of course for the health of individuals. However, applying it to ships between Shanghai and Ningbo and forcing it is inappropriate. The port of Wusong is very crowded, and it is difficult to complete the vaccinations by name. This matter was first seen in Ningbo. If it is forced, it will inevitably cause disputes. It will not only hinder the company's business but also increase the hindrance to navigation safety. Moreover, after a detailed investigation by the Chamber of Commerce, there is no epidemic in Ningbo, so there is no need to inject cholera and inspect stool. Please exempt it to maintain the shipping industry.</p>

The Juji Guangji Dike in Huaining County and the Fenglin Mapu Dike in Wuhu have been breached one after another. The damage to people and livestock is incalculable. Other counties such as Dangtu, Fuyang, He County, Quanjiao, and Guichi are almost entirely flooded, and all the fields and houses are submerged. The magnitude of this flood is unprecedented in decades. The provincial government has allocated funds to provide relief to various counties, including 5,000 yuan for the Guangji Dike emergency repair, 3,000 yuan for Huoshan, 2,000 yuan each for Quanjiao, Shouxian, and Wuwei, and 1,000 yuan each for Fuyang, Huaiyuan, Taihe, Suxian, Haoxian, Wuhe, Qianshan, Huo County, Lujiang, Bengbu, Dingyuan, Chuzhou, Fengtai, and Guichi. Other counties are discussing, and not a single county is not seeking relief. Provincial Chairman Chen Diaoyuan originally planned to go to Jiangxi within a few days, but due to the major disaster throughout the province, he had to stay in Anhui to take charge. Fearing that the Guangji Dike disaster victims would cause trouble in the city, the provincial government has appointed a garrison commander to declare martial law. After 10:00 PM at night, pedestrians are prohibited on the streets. Anqing Wanyi Granary is a large granary storing grain, with a reserve of 20,000 dan of grain. It has now opened a rice mill to provide relief. The price of rice in Wuhu, the provincial capital, has suddenly increased by two yuan per dan.</p>

<p>(Zhenjiang Express Report) The National Vocational Discussion Conference, convened by the China Vocational Education Society, was held at Boxian Park in Zhenjiang on the 1st. Details were published in this newspaper. Yesterday (2nd) was the opening date of the National Vocational Guidance Agency Discussion Conference. The address was still Boxian Park. Attended by Chen Xuan’shan, Huang Renzhi, Jiang Wenyu, Yang Weiyu, Gao Jian’si, Liu Zhan’en, Liu Yunshou, Zhang Zhongjun, Pan Yinge, Han Yulin, Xu Tai’xian, Zhou Kaisen, Xie Shuping, Xie Jiangcheng, Li Quanshi, Yi Jianlou, Yu Xiaochuan, Liu Jianpan, Pan Yangyao, Yang Chong’gao and other sixty people, led by Chairman Liu Zhan’en to perform the ceremony as usual, and delivered the opening speech, roughly saying that the scope of vocational guidance is very broad, and it is usually a mistake to represent the entire vocational guidance cause with vocational introduction. Vocational guidance is a comprehensive term for vocational research, vocational investigation, vocational introduction, vocational self-cultivation, vocational improvement, etc., and cannot be simply understood as one aspect of vocational introduction. Vocational guidance has only 25 years of history in Europe and the United States. The promotion in China is about 10 years ago. At that time, feeling the importance of this cause and the lack of understanding from the social aspect, a week-long vocational guidance campaign was held in Shanghai, Hankou, Beiping, and Jinan. Later, the Shanghai Vocational Guidance Center was established by the China Vocational Education Society, presided over by Mr. Pan Yangyao, and achieved remarkable results. In recent years, places such as Guangdong, Fujian, Liaoning, Hankou, and Tianjin have been planning. Colleagues therefore feel that this cause has recently become more and more developed and that there is a need for unity, so they initiated the Joint Association of Vocational Guidance Agencies. Furthermore, due to the major issues that arise when implementing vocational guidance, first, there is no occupation to guide when implementing vocational guidance; second, what methods are used to implement vocational guidance; third, the timing of vocational guidance, should it be implemented for middle school students or elementary school students; fourth, what kind of people go to implement guidance; and fifth, how to solve economic problems. These five points are recent difficult questions to implement guidance, so they are especially solemnly proposed to contribute to everyone's discussion.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Province Chairman's Representative, He Yushu's Speech (Abridged) <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>I am in charge of agricultural and mining administration and deeply feel the lack of specialized talent. Even with specialized talent, when they handle agricultural and forestry undertakings, they seem to be there to manage administration rather than do the work. They only focus on expanding their personal influence and are unwilling to seek further advancement in their careers. I sincerely hope that those involved in vocational guidance can provide appropriate guidance. The position of vocational guidance organizations in society is like the general staff in the military. Furthermore, I hope that educational institutions, administrative bodies, and society can work together to identify the types of talent needed, so that educational institutions can train such talent to meet practical needs. Following this,</p>
<p>Education Ministry Representative, Gu Shusen's Speech (Abridged): (1) Besides the responsibilities borne by vocational guidance centers, educational institutions must also bear a significant responsibility regarding students' personalities, environments, and various other factors. (2) Those responsible for educational administration should not only focus on building more schools, but also bear significant responsibilities regarding students' career paths after graduation and vocational investigation and analysis. (3) Schools and educational administrative bodies must connect with society to maximize the effectiveness of vocational guidance. Next was the</p>
<p>Reports from Various Vocational Guidance Organizations: Representatives from the Vocational Guidance Federation, the Shanghai Vocational Center, Pan Yangyao, the Nanjing Vocational Guidance Center, Xie Yicheng, the Jiading Vocational Guidance Center, Lu Linxun, the Wuxi Vocational Guidance Center, Rui Ziyu, and the Shanghai YMCA, Zhao Shiying, successively presented reports. After the reports were completed, they began</p>
<p>Discussion of Proposals: Pan Yangyao proposed that a proposal review committee be formed first. The chairman submitted this to a vote, and it was passed. Pan Yangyao, Chen Qingshi, Zhang Zhonghuan, and Li Quanshi were immediately appointed as reviewers. While the proposal review was in progress, the chairman gathered opinions from the entire assembly and raised the issue of young people's career paths for discussion. Chen Qingshi first explained the purpose of discussing this issue, which was not to reach a definitive conclusion but to focus on the improvement of old occupations and the revitalization of new industries in society, as well as the reforms in schools, such as curriculum and facilities, all of which require attention. Li Quanshi then spoke, stating that the issue of young people's career paths is like the marketing of factory products. The success of factory products in the market depends on their durability and practicality. Goods can compete for sales through advertising, and talent can compete for career paths through free competition, which is the examination system. As for expanding career paths, in this era of national rejection of colonialism, going to the frontier, improving old industries, creating new industries, and breaking the favoritism in employment are particularly important. Young people should start their own businesses to solve the career path problem. Gao Jiansi then spoke, stating that recently, some people who have received vocational education cannot find suitable jobs, and those who have jobs cannot maintain them for long, mostly because they lack a service ethic. Therefore, besides vocational education, more emphasis should be placed on character training. Furthermore, primary schools should establish vocational clubs for education, and rural primary schools should serve as the center of rural society, so that graduates of rural primary schools can serve the rural areas. After everyone spoke, the chairman presented a focused argument, summarizing what legitimate career paths young people could have in the future. The atmosphere in the entire assembly became tense. More than twenty people expressed their opinions one after another.</p>
<p>The discussion resulted in a resolution that there were three major career paths for young people in the future: (1) Going back to their hometowns, especially to the countryside. (2) Going to the frontier (such as the Northeast, Northwest, Southwest, and remote areas of their own provinces). (3) Creating new industries and improving old occupations, introducing new occupations. The principles for implementation were: (1) To give young people a sound vocational outlook. (2) To improve school teaching. This proposal was passed after two hours of heated debate. At this time, the proposal review committee had completed its review and submitted the proposals to the general assembly for discussion. The following are excerpts:</p>
<p>Resolutions: (1) This association requests the National Government to issue an order to freeze charitable and relief undertakings in various localities in three phases and convert them into productive employment centers. (2) This association should request the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Industry to establish national product sales offices nationwide and order all provinces, cities, and counties to simultaneously organize national product collection and sales branches to develop new occupations (proposed by the Changshu Poor Children's Home Product Distribution Office Vocational Guidance Center). It was resolved that the above two proposals be handed over to the executive committee for consideration. (3) This association requests the Central Party Headquarters to order party headquarters in various provinces, cities, and counties to assist in the organization of this association (proposed by the Changshu Poor Children's Home Product Distribution Office Vocational Guidance Center). It was resolved that the association is already in the process of registration and does not need further discussion. (4) This association requests the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry to strictly ban speculative activities in exchanges to avoid affecting occupations (proposed by the Changshu Poor Children's Home Product Distribution Office Vocational Guidance Center). It was resolved that it is not within the scope of discussion of this association and should not be included.

<p>It was resolved to retain it. (9) Request the Ministry of Education to flexibly adjust the graduation period of vocational courses in secondary schools to facilitate students' career paths (proposed by the Shanghai Private Aiqun Girls' Middle School). It was resolved that the Ministry of Education already has separate regulations, so no separate proposal is needed. (The above six proposals were proposed by Yu Jianqing and Chen Chongyin.)

(11) Request the Ministry of Education to instruct all primary and secondary schools to increase vocational cultivation activities in extracurricular activities as much as possible.

(14) Request the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Commerce to instruct all middle schools to emphasize home economics training for female students. It was resolved that the new curriculum set by the Ministry of Education already has regulations, so it does not need to be proposed. (15) Request the Ministry of Education to instruct schools at all levels to use classroom space to organize vocational worker evening schools. It was resolved to hand it over to the executive committee for consideration.</p>
<p>(16) Promote career paths for vocational school graduates. It was resolved to handle it together with the second proposal proposed by the Shanghai Vocational Guidance Center. (17) Request the Ministry of Education to instruct all complete primary schools nationwide to add vocational courses suitable for local needs in the final academic year to implement vocational guidance.

(18) Vocational preparation education should be added to the senior grades of primary schools. It was resolved that the Ministry of Education already has regulations, so it is not included. (19) The goal of vocational education should be to have students enter vocational schools for vocational purposes, not to learn a vocation to enter higher schools. (20) Implement rewards for vocational school students after graduation to encourage them to pursue vocations. It was resolved to hand over the above two proposals to the office of the China Vocational Education Society for vigorous promotion. (21) The Outline for the Implementation of the Northwest Reclamation Project. It was resolved that the China Vocational Education Society should assist the original proposer in promoting its early realization. (22) Current primary school education is not suitable for social application, resulting in children who are unable to attend higher schools lacking the ability to seek employment. Improvements should be sought to make it more practical. It was resolved to pass it and ask the Vocational Education Society to consider it.</p>

<h3 id="e95">Three Records of Proposals <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>(31) The goal of vocational education should be to have students focus on entering vocational schools for vocational purposes, not to learn a vocation to enter higher schools. (32) Vocational school students should be assigned by the school to appropriate factories for internships during holidays as a required course. (33) Implement rewards for vocational school students after graduation to encourage them to pursue vocations. (34) Implement raising the standard of vocational education funding to improve teaching. (35) Vocational education in engineering should be implemented separately (proposed by Hebei Provincial Industrial College). (36) Establish vocational introduction bureaus in various provinces and regions within a time limit. (37) Request the Ministry of Education to instruct the education departments of various provinces to establish senior vocational schools for women as much as possible and increase junior vocational schools for women within this year. (38) Vocational education divisions should be established in various provinces as soon as possible to assist the government in promoting and improving vocational schools and other vocational education undertakings (proposed by Gong Zengwei). (39) Please forward the request to the central government to find ways to help unemployed machinists in the capital. (40) Please request the Ministry of Education to determine the curriculum for various vocational schools. (41) Please request the Ministry of Education to order provinces and cities to establish women's vocational supplementary schools, Nanjing Municipal Women's Vocational Supplementary School. (42) Provinces should organize vocational education coordination. (43) Promote ruralized vocational education (proposed by Ye Guxu, representative of Xiamen Private Minnan Vocational Middle School). (44) Outline for the Implementation of the Ximen Reclamation Group (proposed by Yan Zizhuan). (45) Current primary school education is not suitable for social application, resulting in children who are unable to attend higher schools lacking the ability to seek employment. Improvements should be sought to make it more practical (proposed by Lu Xiaobo). (46) Please ask the general assembly to provide assistance in retaining the original regular funding of more than 2,400 yuan for the Taixian County-run Girls' Junior Vocational Middle School to reorganize it into the Taixian County-run Girls' Vocational School in order to develop women's vocational education in Taixian County. (47) The Taixian County-run Girls' Vocational School already has a regular annual funding of 2,400 yuan. In addition to recruiting new students for the home economics department in the first grade, it is also planned to add a sericulture department. The public mulberry gardens in and outside Taixian County total two locations, which were previously operated by the sericulture practice center. The center has now been closed, and the trees within the enclosure have been barren for a long time. There are only dozens of acres of open space. If it can be reorganized, the annual income will also be considerable. Can it be transferred to the Girls' Vocational School to operate the sericulture department? Please make a public decision on the case. (48)) Chen Guobao, Director of the Taixian Education Bureau, was ordered by the department to reorganize the Girls' Junior Vocational Middle School. He once drafted a plan to merge the original students of the school into the corresponding grades of the county middle school and separately recruit a new class of home economics students to be attached to the county middle school. It should only have one department of home economics and should only be attached to the county middle school. Now, representatives are trying to develop vocational education and add a sericulture department, and are assisting the Education Bureau in preparing everything. Director Chen has agreed. It is earnestly requested that the general assembly write to the Education Department to rescind the reorganization plan previously submitted by Director Chen and approve the establishment of the Girls' School. Taixian County-run Girls' Junior Vocational Middle School Representatives Zhou Wenxi and Shao Yan. (49) In the current era of nationwide advocacy for vocational education, training teachers is the most urgent task. To choose a simple and easy approach, it is proposed that the Jiangsu Provincial Education Authorities first run a carpentry teacher training program to greatly create and promote talent.</p>
<p>Suspension of Party Membership</p>
<h3 id="e96">Party Rights Not to Stop Public Duties <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education instructed the Zhejiang Education Department, stating that regarding the request for instructions on whether party members who are suspended from party rights should also be suspended from their respective public duties, this ministry believes that the matter concerns the punishment of party members and immediately sent a letter to the secretariat of the Central Executive Committee for interpretation. A reply was received, stating roughly that after the revision of the resolution of the Central Standing Committee, it was believed that suspension of party rights could not be equated with expulsion from the party, etc., and the case was recorded and sent to the Executive Yuan for compliance. Therefore, party members who are suspended from party rights should not also be suspended from their respective public duties, etc. In accordance with this, it is ordered that you be informed and instructed to comply.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education has extended the deadline for soliciting textbooks and teaching materials for overseas Chinese primary schools in Nanyang by one year. A special order was issued to consulates abroad, stating that the methods for soliciting textbooks and teaching materials for overseas Chinese primary schools in Nanyang were previously ordered by this ministry in November of the 19th year and the deadline was the end of June of this year. Now that the deadline for solicitation has arrived, the number of applicants is not enthusiastic. These types of readings are extremely important and should be contributed by those familiar with overseas Chinese education. In order to encourage editing, the solicitation deadline has been extended by one year. It is still expected that the consulates will reprint and distribute the methods issued by this ministry last year to their affiliated schools, educational organizations, and newspapers to encourage enthusiastic participation.

<p>Yan Ziling of Yuyao in the Eastern Han Dynasty studied with Guangwu in his youth. When Guangwu ascended the throne, he changed his name and hid himself. The emperor ordered someone to search for him and found him. He was offered the position of Counselor, but he declined. He farmed on Mount Fuchun. Later generations named his fishing spot Yanling Shoal, also known as Qili Rapids, in Tonglu, Zhejiang. It stretches for seven li, with mountains on both sides and the water rushing like an arrow. There is a saying that "with wind, seven li; without wind, seventy li," meaning that it is difficult to tow boats, and the speed depends on the wind. However, the scenery is excellent. Unfortunately, due to the passage of time, various constructions have fallen into disrepair. Historical sites and scenic spots are covered in weeds, which diminishes the interest of visitors. Recently, Wang Kun, Yu Shaosong, Zhao Jinqing, Lu Bofan, Lu Zhushuang, Qu Yingguang, and others initiated a restoration project. The estimated cost is 30,000 gold yuan. Each initiator contributed 500 yuan, and the rest was solicited from all walks of life. Wang Zhengting, Shao Lizi, Wang Xiaolai, and others have supported the project, which is now actively underway and scheduled to begin construction by the end of the year. In the future, the fishing platform will be renewed, and Mr. Yan's character will be as towering as the mountains and as long as the rivers. The text of the reconstruction announcement is elegant and grand, and is recorded below to inform those who understand.</p>
<p>I have heard that Yingyang Gao Dao did not yield to Fangxun's humble request to return the government, and that Guzhu Qingbiao ultimately declined Qizhou's offer of a thatched cottage. Therefore, chiseling blanks to attract the departed, the Marquis of Wei was still seen rejected by Duangan, and listening to falsehoods to resign, the Lord of Lu could not obtain Yan He. The meaning of hermitage is not far from ancient times. In this corrupt world, the custom has gradually declined. Yanling of Fuchun is where Mr. Yan of Han Dynasty used to fish. Beside it is the Yuxitai of Xie Gao of the Song Dynasty. Mr. Yan upheld the principle of not serving the court and cherished the ambition of longevity. He lived in the fields and was haggard on the rivers and seas. His legacy is known among the common people. The construction of temples for sacrifices has long been a practice. The comrades and others took advantage of their spare time and pondered on distant thoughts. They rowed up the Tongjiang River and looked up at this temple. They cherished the feelings of a bygone era in the old ruins and were moved by the solitude of a lonely world in the desolate pavilion. It is a pity that the world has been far away for generations, and the spiritual abode has been declining. The Star Pavilion is desolate, and the Xifa Pavilion is deserted. It has not been repaired since the 55th year of Kangxi of the Qing Dynasty. The members and others have not only appreciated the beauty of the scenery but have also admired it deeply. Therefore, they made a wish to repair it and use grand structures. The materials must be firm, and the regulations must be simple. They also thought of planting more pines and cypresses to enhance the view, and to widen the steps for climbing. However, this great undertaking will cost a lot. Therefore, a short letter is written to jointly support this grand event. The clouds, mountains, rivers, and waters dare to compare with Fan Gong's achievements. The red lychees and yellow bananas are attached to Han Yu's righteousness.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Competition of Go Masters <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— Xiaocao</p>
<p>The winner of the first place can win a prize of 800 yuan</p>
<p>The Chinese Go Club on Sapo Road in this city has been established for three months. There are many enthusiastic members. In order to increase the interest of the members, the club has launched a large-scale competition to examine the achievements of each player and to seek deeper artistic cultivation. Mr. Zhang Danru and Mr. Sheng Zecheng, the vice presidents of the club, took the lead in donating cash to reward the winners. At that time, the competition will be divided into two groups, A and B. (That is, Group A will compete with Group A, and Group B will compete with Group B. Groups A and B will not compete with each other.) The organization of each group's level will be based on the club's general secretary, Mr. Liu Dihuai, as the standard, and he will judge whether they are Group A or B. Those who play Even with Mr. Liu or Mr. Liu gives first are assigned to Group A. If Mr. Liu gives two stones, they are assigned to Group B. Each group will consist of 10 people, and each person will play 27 games. The competition will last for one month. Each group will select three winners. The champion of Group A will receive a prize of 800 yuan, the second place will receive 400 yuan, and the third place will receive 200 yuan. The first place in Group B will receive 300 yuan, the second place will receive 200 yuan, and the third place will receive 100 yuan. Several rules for the game will be formulated, and the club's president, Mr. Du Shenchen, will be publicly elected as the chief judge. Currently, it is feared that players from other cities may not be able to arrive in time. (There are many masters in the Pingjin area.) Therefore, the competition is tentatively scheduled to begin in mid-August and end in mid-September. Those who are hidden in the mountains and forests and possess superb Go skills can register with the club and join the competition. At that time, masters from all over the country will gather together to compete for the championship. This unprecedented event will be very spectacular.</p>

Bank Exchange Settlement on Sunday - Yesterday was Sunday, and banks were closed as usual. There were no transactions or settlements to record. The Shanghai tael in the market, in the early market, was traded at 7 qian, 2 fen, 3 li, 7 hao, and half. In the afternoon market, it was traded at 7 qian, 2 fen, 4 li. In the early market, remittance drafts amounted to 445,000, and there were no transactions in banknotes. In the afternoon market, remittance drafts amounted to 345,000, and banknote off-market transactions were 20,000, with no trading activity.

The silver拆拆 rate was 5% in both the morning and afternoon markets. Small qianzhuang transactions amounted to over 400,000.

Copper coins remained at 380,000 qian wen, the same as the previous day. Securities: Last week, bond prices slightly rebounded, with a relatively stable trend and minimal daily fluctuations. Due to settlement, there were only four trading days in the entire week. Last week, the bond market conditions at the Shanghai Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange were as follows: Due to the settlement of July futures, the market was closed on Wednesday and Thursday, with only four trading days in the entire week. Among them, July futures were only available on the first day of the week, and although September futures were scheduled to open on Friday, they were not seen on that day. There were also few transactions at the weekend, so the entire cycle of futures, except for the first day of the week, was only for August futures. Although the market was not quiet, the trading volume was far less than before, with Monday reaching 19 million, Thursday about 17 million, and Saturday also having over 14 million. Tuesday was only 6.7 million, totaling 56.93 million, a further decrease of 25 million compared to the previous week. The 20 Guan bond accounted for the most, at 17.395 million yuan, while other bonds were far less than before, such as 20 roll bonds at 9.74 million yuan, 19 Guan bonds at 6.285 million jiao, 19 good bonds at 5.665 million yuan, disarmament bonds at 5.475 million jiao, reorganization bonds at 3.74 million yuan, customs duties at 745,000 yuan, consolidation bonds at 515,000 yuan, the 1996 public bond at 945,000 yuan, and financial bonds at 15,000 yuan. Only the unified tax had increasing transactions, totaling 6.41 million yuan. The spot market was still sparse, with only 41,000 yuan traded throughout the week, of which 20 Guan bonds accounted for 24,000 yuan, and the rest were only a few thousand yuan. Regarding the trend of various bond prices last week, although Monday was slightly firm, the fluctuations were minimal. On Tuesday, due to retail investors selling, and the buying side being very cold, the downward trend was very strong, resulting in the unified tax decreasing by 2.20 yuan, and the disarmament, 19 Guan, and 20 Guan roll bonds also decreasing by about 1 yuan, with other bonds also weakening. Especially on Friday, the market saw that the forward futures were still limited to existing goods, and the bond market environment was very beneficial to the buying side, so bond prices rose step by step due to demand exceeding supply, with the 20 roll bonds rising by more than 2.5 yuan, and the unified tax and 20 Guan bonds also rising by about 1.6 yuan, and other bonds increasing by about 1 yuan. On the weekend, the buying side still dominated, and the upward trend did not weaken, but only the 20 Guan bonds rose by more than 1 yuan, and there were no major changes in other bonds. As a result, all bonds rebounded slightly compared to the previous week. The bond market situation seemed to be better. The statistics of the high, low, and fluctuations of various bond prices in the past week are listed below (unit: yuan): <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>

<p>(Note) The fluctuations of the current goods in the above table such as Customs, Disarmament, 19 Customs are calculated by excluding the principal and interest of the previous period. Yarn and Cotton: In addition to a drop of three taels in the spot price of yarn last week, current sales are booming... with 15,000 bales sold. The yarn market was relatively stable at the beginning of the week, and the development of coarse yarn trading between the Guangdong and Yunnan gangs led to a slight strengthening of sentiment. However, the overseas cotton market was trending downwards, so sentiment was dull. In addition, Japanese yarn suddenly became active, and trading started again, revealing a weakening trend in the market. Later, with the Factory Law taking effect on August 1st, the market situation slightly improved. However, the third-grade yarn and the American and Indian cotton markets continued to decline, showing a significant downward trend. At the same time, the tense situation in the northern war zone and the sharp drop in raw cotton caused the yarn market to fundamentally loosen, and the downward trend was sharp. The market was thus in a slump. As for the actual demand side, seeing the unfavorable environment, they were all hesitant to move forward, and business was greatly affected. In addition, due to floods in various areas, autumn sales were affected, so there were many sellers. However, due to weak base stocks and the pessimism of the world cotton industry, it was difficult to recover due to the pressure. The total transaction volume of labeled yarn throughout the week was 194,100 bales, and the prices for each month fell by more than three taels compared to the previous week. Among the customer gangs, current sales were still good, with each gang buying a total of 13,210 bales. Among the peers, 1,600 bales were entered. The selling price fell by 1.2 taels. The amount of bales purchased by each gang is recorded below:</p>
<p>帮口	包额	帮口	包额	帮口	包额</p>
<p>Guangdong	3,700	Yunnan	2,380	Shantou	1,400</p>
<p>Sichuan	2,010	Qingdao	785	Inland	25</p>

<p>North Gang	215	Jiangxi	20	Datong	220</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Gang	300	Peers	1,600</p>
<p>Last week, the Han cotton price rose sharply and then fell, resulting in a drop of 1.89 qian compared to the previous weekend. At the beginning of last week, the cotton market was affected by floods in various areas, with more cotton fields being submerged. Moreover, the continuous rain made people worry about the prospects of new cotton, so everyone was bullish, and inland gangs came to Shanghai to purchase futures in large quantities, causing the market to be extremely excited. As a result, there was a period of rising prices. Before long, the weather cleared up, and the floodwaters receded slightly. However, the losses were already significant. The world cotton market was also unfavorable, with a sharp downward trend and pressure far exceeding that of the floods. Moreover, the gold price was fluctuating, and the calculation of the silver price of foreign cotton was low. As a result, the cotton market was greatly affected, and the local and foreign machine gangs sold off together. Once there was bad news, the reaction was even sharper. The highest price of labeled cotton in August was 39 taels, and the lowest price last week was 36.15 taels, which shows the magnitude of the change. At the end of the week, labeled cotton was showing new low prices step by step due to the frequent decline of American cotton. Indian cotton had a tendency to come to Guangdong, and Shenxin had already purchased 4,000 pieces, causing buyers to be uneasy, and retail investors were in a state of terror. Japanese merchants were also selling, and the market was falling wildly and uncontrollably. The prices for each month fell by 1.89 qian compared to the previous week, and the transaction volume was 587,800 dan. The source was 1,600 bales of Yao cotton, and Shenxin Factory entered 4,000 pieces of Brock cotton, which were immediately shipped to the factory. American cotton fell by 75 pounds compared to the previous week. The amount of bales purchased by manufacturers and firms is recorded below:</p>
<p>廠商進	最高價	最低價	成交數	期限</p>
<p>Brock	41.00	4,000 pieces immediately shipped to the factory</p>
<p>Machine Cotton	38.50	300 bales	Spot</p>
<p>Firm Cotton	Shaanxi Cotton	38.40	200 bales	Spot</p>
<p>The downward trend of American and Indian cotton in the warehouse continued. Yesterday, American cotton was weak due to good weather and smooth cotton harvest, and sellers put pressure on it. The futures price fell by 11 to 18 pounds, and the spot price fell by 10 pounds. British cotton was closed, and Indian cotton was initially weak due to the closing of long positions. Later, it slightly rebounded due to the hedging of some short positions. It is estimated that Pingguoer, Aomula, and Bailuoxi all fell by 2.50 rupees.

<p>Grain: Pudong New Japonica Rice Slightly Down by 0.5 Yuan - Nanshi: Yesterday, 30 dan of Pudong New Japonica Rice arrived at the port. Shenli and Xinchang made purchases, and the price fell by 0.5 yuan compared to the previous market. However, more than ten ships of old goods arrived, and the separate dismantling of medium-grade goods did not improve. Shops did not show any activity, and no one cared about Qingjiao thin rice, with a slight downward trend of 0.1 yuan. Changshu thick Japonica Rice: Hundreds of dan were stockpiled by囤户in the warehouse, and the price remained the same as the original price. There was slightly less supply of foreign Dujian, and the river accumulation was weak, with a slightly firmer opening of 0.5 yuan. Tongbian Yin Hua was sold separately at a slightly lower price. Xinzha: There were not many sources, and the rising price of new Japonica rice stabilized the price of old goods. The buying sentiment was very strong, and people were pessimistic. Suchang top Japonica Rice and Kunshan Jiangyin rice were all short by 0.2 yuan. The appetite of the early and late rice village帮was unchanged, and the opening was reduced by one尺. Yang Dujian Yuan Yang rice rose daily, and transactions were still good, slightly higher by nearly 0.1 yuan. The arrival and sales of glutinous rice were evenly priced. Yin Hua arrived today, and all were斜脱, with the situation improving by 0.3 to 0.4 yuan. The river factory had a volume of 3,600 to 3,700 dan. Hardware: White Iron Tile Sales are Good - Yesterday was Sunday, and hardware transactions were very light. There were no large-scale embellishments from customer帮and factories. However, the construction帮were exceptionally excited about the white iron tile business. It was found that the city opened up to 400 to 500 dan. The price for No. 28 was 16 taels and 5 qian, No. 26 was 15 taels and 9.5 qian, No. 24 was 15 taels, and No. 22 was 14 taels and 5 qian. However, as autumn approaches, the sales of this product are quite vigorous, so it is expected that the price will rise and not fall. Silk and Tea: Tea merchants oppose inspection. They resolved to organize a petition delegation. The Bureau of Commodity Inspection of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce is implementing inspection of exported tea leaves. Previously, the foreign firms had stated their reasons and expressed their opposition, and notified the tea warehouses, stating that in addition to returning the original barrel of tea that failed to pass the inspection, they would also be responsible for various unlimited losses. Chinese tea merchants are in this season of tea industry decline, and have no extra strength to resist the foreign firms. They are deeply worried that the export of colored tea will be prohibited in the future, and the local shops will not be able to sell it. All the capital of the merchants will inevitably be lost. Therefore, a second plenary meeting was convened at the Foreign Firms Tea Industry Association a few days ago, and it was resolved to organize a petition delegation and submit a document to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and the Bureau of Commodity Inspection, requesting the cancellation of the inspection of exported tea leaves.

<h3 id="e112">The Wonderful Method of Sanctioning the Happiness Chain <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— Jing Bo</p>
<p>Recently, there has been a kind of "happiness chain" spreading throughout the country. As far as I am concerned, I have received no less than several dozen such chains from friends within a week. This kind of chain was also received several times in the past few years, but most of them were in English or French, with Chinese ones being extremely rare. Unexpectedly, this year, the gentlemen and ladies of the whole country actually regard it as a fashionable undertaking, sending them out in large quantities. The reason for this is unknown. Social figures are currently studying methods of sanctioning it. Mr. Zhu Hongda, a famous lawyer in Shanghai, recently published a letter he sent to a friend in response to receiving a chain, the wording of which is extraordinarily humorous and quite reasonable. If various circles can follow suit, this kind of meaningless superstition can naturally be eliminated invisibly. The original letter is recorded below. (Omitted above) We haven't communicated for a long time. Suddenly, I received your grand communication. Reading its content, I know that you sent the letter to me because of superstition. This time, social figures are engaging in mutually forwarding happiness chains, which can be said to be extremely meaningless. If each of those who sent them is ignored by colleagues, it is fine, but in your case, you actually printed nine copies for distribution, so I must warn you. I ask, can the lives and deaths of colleagues be affected by curses? You must know that scholars don't have time to research the problem of life and death. The progress of modern medical physiology is advancing by leaps and bounds. As for collapsing houses, it is even more absurd. Whether a house is solid or not is based on the principles of engineering. You are actually so superstitious. You should know that superstition violates science. This kind of behavior not only wastes your own resources, but also needlessly increases the labor of the post office, affecting society. My method of warning you is to forward the two copies you sent back to you. If you believe in it, you must print eighteen copies for distribution. It would be best if, among the eighteen copies, you send back two copies to me again, so that I can return them to you as before. You would probably have no peaceful days. If you agree with my idea, then quickly destroy the remaining seven copies. (Omitted below)</p>
<h3 id="e113">The Tragic Situation of the Great Flood in Wuzhen <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— Rui Hongchu</p>
<p>Recently, it has been raining continuously for half a month. A few days ago, I returned to my hometown of Wuzhen on business. Day after day, the wind and rain raged, the river water rose sharply, the fields were submerged, and boats were cut off from traffic due to the high water level under the bridges. With nothing to do in the rainy window, I hereby record the tragic situation of the great flood that I witnessed, as follows.</p>
<p>The Streets are a Vast Expanse of Water The heavy rain has lasted for half a month, and the river water has risen sharply. In low-lying areas, it has spread to the streets, starting from the Labor Family Wharf in Dongzha and ending at Xiaowuzhen. In places like the Ji Family Estuary in Nanzha, the accumulated water is several feet deep. Moreover, there are no fewer than several thousand buildings along the river that are all submerged in the water, resembling a vast expanse of water. It is pitiful.</p>
<p>It is Difficult to Walk on the Floating Bridges In the town, such as the Yan Ting Nei Nong, Caishen Bay, and Sanli Tang, the streets are covered with several inches of accumulated water. The wide roads are filled with the sighs of "I can't walk, brother!" So, wooden floating bridges are built to facilitate transportation. Modern girls, wearing high-heeled leather shoes, exclaim "It's hard to walk!" non-stop when crossing the floating bridges.</p>
<p>Men and Women Scoop Water Day and Night The majority of farmers in the countryside rely on farming for a living. This time, they suddenly suffered a natural disaster, and the fields are about to be submerged. Therefore, farmers, both men and women, scoop water day and night without stopping, enduring hardship. It is extremely unfortunate.</p>
<p>Reports of Floods from Various Villages Since the torrential rain on July 6th, it has been more than twenty days, and it has been continuously raining. The water level rises daily. Hundreds of acres of rice fields in the surrounding villages have all become a swamp. If the weather clears and the water recedes, it may still be possible to salvage the situation. Unexpectedly, it has continued to rain in recent days, and the water is rising severely in secret. The phenomenon of flooding has already formed. There will be no harvest of rice in the farmland. Therefore, farmers are flocking to the county government to report the flood, one after another.</p>
<p>Rice Prices Soar Daily The river water is high, and the source of rice and grain is scarce. Rice merchants are taking the opportunity to raise rice prices, increasing the price per dan by one yuan, with two increases in one day. Therefore, the rice merchants are all smiles, while the common people suffer.</p>
<p>News from the Art World Mr. Yu Tongfu, Mr. Guan Yide, Mr. Chen Juanyin, and Mr. Xu Kangmin are the four outstanding figures in the painting world of Wuzhong. Their landscapes enter Song and Yuan dynasties through the Four Wangs, and their flower-and-bird paintings acquire the lost meaning of Chong Si. Their brushwork is exquisite and their ink is wonderful. People in Wu are so addicted to them that it has become a habit. However, due to their duties, the four gentlemen, although like-minded, often experience separation. One day two weeks ago, the four suddenly met at the co-drinking ice room in the park. They expressed their feelings of separation and chatted happily. Due to the difficulty of gathering together, they decided to collaborate on a hundred pages of fan leaves to commemorate this encounter. The news spread, and the quota was full in less than three days. Upon request, they increased the quota by fifty. But in less than a day, it was full again. After repeated requests from various parties, they reluctantly agreed to collaborate on a hundred hanging scrolls to forge ink bonds.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Travel Notes of India (73) <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>The fourth was the day of the Indian New Year festival. At nine o'clock, the students officially performed the painting and splashing water rituals. They went to the head of the school one by one, and the head of the school performed the ritual for each of them. There were two kinds of rituals. One, each student took red powder and painted the head of the school's forehead. Second, the head of the school performed the ritual of connecting left and right shoulders with each student. Think about it, each student painted once, and there were hundreds of students. Then the head of the school's head and face can be imagined. The Indian university system is that a university has a president, and there are six or seven departments under him. Each department has a head of the school who has full authority to handle everything. There is no title of president. The students sprinkle colored water on each other. Some came to paint my face. I only allowed them to dot my forehead. But if everyone came, it would be a great suffering. So I closed the door and didn't go out. After a while, someone knocked on the door to perform the painting ritual, with great sincerity. They asked me if China had this custom. I replied, "No." I heard that France has a flower-scattering party. Every festival, all the citizens go out to play and throw flowers at each other. The flowers fall on the ground, several inches thick. India has many flowers. If the ritual of sprinkling water and painting faces is changed to scattering flowers, it would be more fragrant, elegant, and interesting. The students said, "We know that this custom is not very good. Our bodies are covered with dirt. Our clothes cannot be worn. The whole country is crazy. But it is not easy to change." This is an Indian custom. I said, "In today's world, everything is being renewed. You can write articles and publish them in newspapers to advocate it. You must renew customs to seek evolution." The reason for painting faces is rooted in religion. All Indians who paint their faces are practitioners, representing closeness to God. Now, imitating and promoting it, everyone paints it during the New Year to express closeness to God, which is a very auspicious ritual. It is rooted in faith, so it is not easy to reform. But it seems not difficult to replace it with scattering flowers. After performing the painting ritual, they still have to be given candy, like paying New Year's greetings in our country. So young people are more happy to do this movement.</p>
<p>We indirectly read Indian history from English, and it is difficult to remember its people's names and place names. Indian people's names are especially difficult to remember. It is very different from the simplicity of Chinese names. What I object to most is Indian writing. Although I know that a friend said how good Sanskrit is, but watching the repeated redundancy of the Buddhist scriptures, I dislike it very much, and what I hate most is its people's names. Often with acquaintances of many days, I cannot call their names. This is not the stupidity of the Chinese, but the stupidity of the Indian language. However, Indian people's names all have deep philosophical and religious meanings. We love its meaning but hate its name.</p>
<p>According to Indian history, Buddhism flourished in the sixth century BC and declined in the twelfth century AD. Hinduism revived. Therefore, the prevalence of Buddhism in India lasted for 1,800 years. It has been gone for more than 700 years now. In the future, there will be a tendency to revive. In 273 BC, King Ashoka unified the five Indias and sent his younger siblings to Ceylon to preach. I asked a friend from Ceylon to tell the truth, and he did not believe that the Buddha had personally been to Ceylon. However, there are records of preaching on Mount Lanka. Perhaps the Buddha went by boat, which is not difficult. I dare not easily believe in myths of flight and incarnation. King Ashoka was the only saintly king. History says that he built official roads, planted mango trees, built public wells, and promoted loyalty and filial piety. There were no criminals in the whole country. It was the rule of Yao and Shun. However, a monk told me that King Ashoka did not believe in Buddhism at first. When he was using troops, he wanted to kill a bhikkhu. The bhikkhu was not afraid at all. The king asked him why he was not afraid of death. He replied that it was because he understood life and death. The king then asked about the Buddha's teachings and was moved to believe in Buddhism.</p>

<p>— Yao Sufeng</p>
<p>Before he could answer, his mother couldn't help but interject. She had originally thought that since Xiao Rong had returned, he would stay for a day or two before leaving, but now hearing him say that he was leaving immediately, she was naturally very unhappy. So she also pleaded with Xiao Rong to stay. However, Xiao Rong always expressed that he had to leave.</p>
<p>His father, too, felt that it was inappropriate for Xiao Rong to return to Shanghai immediately. He firmly said, "No! You come back only to ask for money, and once you get the money, you want to leave. Putting aside that you are my son and I am your father, if I ask you to go tomorrow, you must obey. Even if you were my elder, and I were your junior, if I begged you to go tomorrow, shouldn't you at least give me some face?" He was clearly a bit angry. Xiao Rong was speechless.</p>
<p>However, Xiao Rong still felt that he had to leave. No matter his wife's entreaties, his mother's persuasion, or his father's orders, all failed. His father finally became furious. "Fine! Let him go! You don't need to talk to him anymore." After saying that, he walked outside.</p>
<p>Xiao Rong's wife was almost about to cry, but Xiao Rong, without turning his head, followed his father stiffly and walked out, without saying a single word of farewell, nor even looking at them.</p>
<p>Xiao Rong finally left in his father's carriage. His mother and wife saw him off at the door, but he didn't seem to notice them. When the carriage had driven far away, shrinking from the entire carriage and people to a tiny black dot, they still stretched their necks and gazed into the distance. After a while, everything disappeared from their sight. The mother-in-law and daughter-in-law could only sigh in unison and lazily walked inside.</p>
<p>On the other side, the carriage had already arrived at the station. Xiao Rong got out of the carriage and finally said a few words to his father: "Dad! I'm leaving! I'll come back as soon as I have time!"</p>
<p>"You must study hard in school. When you read a book, you must think about where the money for your studies comes from. Go and do well! Don't be lazy and love to play, and disappoint our good intentions!"</p>
<p>Xiao Rong nodded and walked into the crowd. Although his father felt very angry, when he thought that he had been pulling a carriage hard for fifteen years and had made no progress, and that he only had such a son, and all his hopes were on him, he smiled slightly to himself.</p>
<p>The train departed. Xiao Rong, who had arrived in a third-class carriage, was now sitting proudly in a second-class carriage, drinking soda and eating Western food. Who would know where his money came from?</p>
<p>Three hours later, the magnificent Shanghai shone in Xiao Rong's eyes again, and he regained his vibrancy from the day before. Everything about his home had disappeared in the turning of the wheels. He didn't want to think about it anymore, and he wouldn't think about it anymore.</p>

<h3 id="e117">Complicated Gold Market Last Week <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Fell by Seven Taels and Seven Mace Compared to the Previous Weekend</p>
<p>Reversal from Sharp Rise to Setback, Fluctuating by Twenty-Two Taels The gold market last week saw violent fluctuations, turning from a sharp rise to a setback, with frequent ups and downs. At the beginning of the week, it once surged above 750 taels, reaching 58.5 taels, due to the sharp fall in the silver market. However, due to the poor environment, with news that Mexico was changing to silver coins and stopping gold coins, people seemed to be bearish, causing the bulls to dare not do it in advance, so it was difficult to break through the 60-tael mark. Afterwards, the trend went downstream, forming a situation of hovering. By Thursday, large households sold off aggressively, causing a sudden drop to 736.5 taels. Afterwards, it hovered around 40 taels, with a total difference of 22 taels. Overall, it fell back by 7.7 taels. As for domestic and foreign silver markets and drafts, the statistics only showed a slight increase, but there was no important news. The buying and selling by both bulls and bears in the industry seemed to be quite different. According to the closing price on the exchange rate, it was around 50 taels. The spot red bar sales market was still active, with Tianjin and other gangs buying every day, so the price ranged from 9.5 taels to over 11 taels (calculated by progressively adding the gold price). However, the inventory was full, with about 30,000 bars, which may have suppressed the gold price. The public bill (August futures) began to be collected on Saturday (August 1st), with about 8,000 bars collected on the first day. The collectors were mostly spot dealers. Therefore, the rise and fall of the future gold price is difficult to predict, and there may still be a change. It is said that Germany will issue silver coins, but the raw silver needed is from previous inventory, so the price of silver will not rise in the short term. The general situation of this week is summarized below.</p>
<p>Mexico's Change to Silver Coins Gradually Trending Downward Since Monday (July 27), the large silver bar retreated 3.125, the American silver retreated 3.75, the advance order retreated half a stop, and the domestic market was also tight. The industry rushed to make settlements. The opening of the September gold price immediately rose to 756 taels. American stocks fell, and there were many buyers, so it was 58.5 taels. Later, due to the sale by Wu and others, it plunged by more than 5 taels. Luo competed to buy it, so it rose by 4 or 5 taels. In the afternoon, the advance order appeared loose, and the bank was quite willing to sell it, and finally broke through 50 taels, calculated as 49.5 taels, closing at 52.7 mace, which had risen for three consecutive days, totaling 3.2 mace. However, due to the saying that Mexico changed to silver coins, it was difficult to break through 60 taels, and it repeatedly went downstream. The next day, the large silver bar rebounded by half a penny, and the silver price also increased by half a cent. The advance order only increased by half a stop, the domestic market also loosened, and Chinese merchants still dumped. The situation was the opposite of the previous day. The gold market opened at 742 taels, plunging by 10.07 mace. Then, due to the stable foundation of the large bar, and America was willing to sell at the listed price of 0.0625, it rebounded by more than 4 mace. After that, it was flat, with slight advances and retreats. In the afternoon, it was even flatter, closing at 45 taels, retreating by 7.7 mace. On Wednesday, the large bar retreated by 0.25, and the silver price of 1.25 advance order did not change. The price was stable in both the open and the hidden markets.
