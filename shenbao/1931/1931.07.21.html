<h3>研究日本（三）</h3>
<p>我國自鴉片戰爭而後。始怵然於西方列强之可畏而自愧不如。自列强之一切政體。制度。文化。軍備。概括之爲洋務。守舊者視爲夷狄之道。無足師法。維新者亦僅師其皮毛。而不究其實際。憂深而昩時者。則視洋務如謎如玄學。謂爲非等閑所能知。以李鴻章之自命爲習於洋務。而其對於洋務之見解。則亦以爲我國政教風俗。無一不優於他國。所不及者惟槍砲機器耳。吾但學此。而洋務之能事畢矣。皮毛之見。實可代表當時對國際情况觀察之一斑。德國俾士麥克於淸日戰爭之先。曾有曰「中國和日本的競爭。日本必勝。中國必敗。……因爲日本到歐洲來的人。討論各種學術。講求政治原理。謀歸國爲根本之改造。中國人到歐洲來的。只問某廠的船砲造得如何。價値貴賤如何。買了回去使用就完事。」俾氏此論。對於我國當時對於西方文明觀察之膚淺。實爲的論。然而此種態度。直至今日。一般淺識者流。對於日本之觀察。又何嘗不認爲我國地大物博民衆。爲五千年來之文明古國。所不如日者。亦不過海陸空軍備耳。膚淺之見。古今如出一轍。此今日吾人最應深切認淸者也。夫對一國之觀察。不在觀其表面上之國力。而在審察其立國之本。如建築家之觀察房屋。初不以其外表裝飾之華麗。遂確定爲堅固之房屋。必也審視其每一片磚。每一棟樑。考察其全部材料之性質與構造。然後此屋之一切。乃能了然於心。</p>
<p>發言評論。自無不的。吾人之研究日本。亦猶是也。必須審其民族性。了解其生活。更從而研究其文化制度。與變遷之趨向。推斷其將來。則庶幾能知日本。槍砲機器。固非我國之所能敵。卽其他又有何物足以制日本之弱點戴季陶先生曾有言。「中國這個題目。日本人也不曉得放在解剖台上解剖了幾千百次。裝在試騐管裏化騐了幾千百次。我國中國人却只一味的排斥反對。再不肯做研究工夫。幾乎連日本字都不願意看。日本話都不願意聽。日本人都不願意見。這眞呌做思想上閉關自守。智識上的義和團了。」言之沉痛。無逾於。此總之立國於現代。於國際情况。無論其爲蘇聯。爲英。爲美。爲法。……都應作鞭壁入裏之研究。乃能謀應付。而對日則更其顯而倍切者。我國專門學者。當急起直追。將日本問題放在解剖台上。裝在試騐管裏。以顯微鏡觀其現象。又以千里鏡矚其未來。此其時矣。</p>

<h3>赤禍與中國之存亡（再續）</h3>
<p>楊杏佛</p>
<p>共黨之分田抗租、僅爲其誘惑農民之暫時手段、故謂之爲初步深入土地革命政策、同時又恐農民覺悟其所分之田、僅爲一現之曇花、乃極力禁止黨員提出「没收一切土地」口號、主張共耕制度、（卽實現共産制度之國有農塲）與用政府法令或黨的决議、禁止土地買賣和租借、其理由卽謂此種辦法、皆可使共黨脫離全國農民羣衆也、（見蘇維埃區域目前工作計劃）然共産黨土地政綱之最後目的、仍在消滅地主及私有土地制度、實現土地國有、分田之農民、不過彼黨土地革命過程中之芻狗而已、至共産黨員分田時之自留肥土、或隂厚親故、及仍徵極重之土地稅皆、顯而易見之弊、不足論矣、</p>
<p>共黨對於民衆組織之政策、在用土地革命利益引誘農村基本民衆、貧農雇農苦力爲其武裝暴動及階級鬥爭之主力、對中農暫取聯絡、對富農則完全敵視、務排斥富農成分於政權及一切武裝組織之外、蓋其所用以引誘貧農佃農苦力之利益、實取之富農、苟富農亦有政權、亦參加武裝組織、則階級鬥爭必起内閧、利益分配、將無從出、匪區中民衆組織、在鄉村城市、均有手工業工會苦力工會、此外專在城鎭者、有産業工會店員工會、專在鄉村者、有雇農工會貧農團貧民協會等、其中雇農工會最爲重要、共黨認之爲實現無産階級、在現時民主革命中領導權之重要工具之一、各工會依産業或職業爲標準而組織、以區爲單位、進而有鄉村之分會全體工會、乃至全特區之總工會、至冠以一縣或特别市名稱之總工會、乃包括城鄉各業之總工會而成、共産對於土匪流氓、亦充分利用、其方法爲「要吸引土匪流氓羣衆也來得到土地革命的利益、最好的辦法、是解散他們固有的組織、分配他們以土地、解决他們的反動領袖、卽是同情革命的領袖、至少也不能讓他領率原來的部隊、」（見蘇區目前工作計劃）共洪江會三點會之會黨、均爲彼等所歡迎、所謂歡迎洪家弟兄之口號、卽指此也、江西洪帮勢力、近雖式微、然爲赤匪偵探報信、亦予官軍以多少之不利、此外舊式農民武裝組織、如小刀會紅槍會之類、共黨亦盡量吸收、其對付之法、與對付會黨土匪相似、</p>
<p>勦赤經過　中國赤禍、以贛鄂湘三省爲最甚、三省之中、又以贛省爲最烈、赤匪軍力、幾完全集中江西、十六年國民黨反共時、方志敏邵式平由南昌逃至弋陽、僅携槍七枝、今則方志敏所部紅軍第十軍、人數在一萬以上、槍亦在二千枝以上、朱德當十六年由贛竄湘與毛澤東會合時、槍數亦僅二三百枝、今則朱德所部、人數在三萬以上、槍枝亦在一萬以上、赤匪勢力膨漲之速、由此可見、三年之前、少數烏合之衆、今乃須動全國之兵、蔣總司令親臨前敵、始有勦滅之希望、此豈當時負地方之賣者夢想所及耶、江西之被赤禍、已近四年、而積極勦赤之進行、實始於討伐閻馮以後、内戰之影響勦赤、於此又可見矣、</p>
<p>江西剿赤、可分爲三時期、第一期爲魯滌平氏督剿時期、第二期爲何應欽氏督剿時期、第三期爲蔣介石氏督剿時期、十八年魯氏長贛、原有十八·五十·十二·三師以上兵力、以之剿赤、當能應付、嗣因内戰復起五十及十二兩師均被調離省、僅、十八及十三兩師守贛、赤燄乃日張、江西地方被蹂躪者達六十縣以上、湘鄂各省皆有駐軍負剿赤之責、惟各劃界自守、不願越雷池一步、故匪得從容出没三省、自去秋討伐閻馮軍事結束、赤禍已成燎原、政府乃令五十及十二兩師回贛、復加調勁旅約十七師共十餘萬人以上、歸魯氏指揮、此役雖克復吉安諸縣、惟十八師因深入匪區被圍、全師覆没、師長張輝瓊被擒遇害、五十師亦大敗、損失過半、匪勢復熾、此役失敗原因、雖甚複雜、惟觀戴岳旅長所云六點、（一）軍隊時常更調、每使將要消滅之殘匪得死灰復燃、（二）勦匪部隊、不明瞭匪區情形與組織、（三）勦匪部隊各懷畛域之見、意存敷衍、不肯認眞澈底、勦辦、（四）縣長不得力而貪汚、警察紀律不好、到處擾民、地方豪劣、剥削壓迫、使人民受寃受屈、發生反感、挺而走險、（五）因黨政軍民不能切實合作一致去消滅共匪、（六）農村經濟破産、手工工人失業人民生計艱難、加以共匪利誘威迫、貧民從者日衆、（見戴氏所著對於勦匪淸鄉的一點貢）</p>
<p>獻）已可得其大概矣、</p>
<p>第一期勦匪失敗、政府知匪勢披猖、不可忽視、且察知此役失敗、由於指揮之不統一、遂派軍政部長何應欽代行總司令職權、到贛督勦、何氏於本年二月到贛、鑒於從前輕敵深入之失計、乃採取曾國瀋「穩紮穩打節節推進」之策、同時對整理地方招集流亡及設立各縣保衞團、均有相當之計劃、軍事方面、亦有相當進展、及五月兩廣獨立事件發生、匪勢復盛、孫連仲公秉藩王金鈺部隊相繼敗挫、胡祖玉復因督戰陣亡、至此中央知非用全力勦赤、絶難收肅淸之效、社會人士、對於贛鄂湘之赤禍、始稍稍加以注意、蔣總司令毅然决然來贛督勦、全國軍隊之精銳、齊集江西、第三期之勦赤工作、遂於七月開始、現在國軍在贛部隊人數槍枝、均在三十萬以上、據最近報告、右翼陳銘樞攻東固、中路孫連仲攻寗都、左翼何應欽攻廣昌、均節節進展、此期之勦赤、當可如預定計劃、獲最後之勝利、惟根本肅淸赤匪、恐非短期内所能實現、尤不能專賴軍隊之武力、</p>
<p>論　今日之赤禍、不特爲民國成立以來之浩刧、亦爲中國數千年來未有之奇變、社會演進、運窮則變、封建制度宗法社會之中國、已將隨帝王與軍閥而俱去、代之者爲獨立自由之三民主義中國乎、抑爲附庸蘇俄之共産主義中國乎、此全國國民無論男女老少所當舉以自問者也勦赤軍事勝利、不過治標而已、軍事善後、經緯萬端、農民生計、不能解决、地方政治、不能修明、雖無赤匪、國豈能久、而况土劣貪汚窮困、卽爲赤禍之製造廠乎、故欲根本肅淸赤匪、惟有實行三民主義、欲實行三民主義、必須有長期之國内和平、今日黨内外之政見、無論如何不同、較之民族存亡問題、均爲細節、應力謀溝通、避免内戰、以促成全國之大團結、共赴國難、否則不爲蘇俄卵翼下之外蒙、必爲暴日踐踏下之朝鮮、願我國人、勿河漢斯言也、（完）</p>

<h3>台維斯盃帶際决賽英國揚眉吐氣壓倒美國</h3>
<p>▲結果三比二英國勝</p>
<p>丨英國十一年宿願至今方償丨</p>
<p>丨美國三單打失手先勝後敗丨</p>
<p>▲英法决賽廿四日起</p>
<p>▲巴黎電　世界台維斯盃網球賽自一九一九年以來、美國莫不參加却令治賽之一幕、此番滿含希望之空氣中、忽而晴天霹靂、震破全美網球界之迷夢、蓋美國隊二對三失敗之惡訊、竟傳揚於五大洲、今日美國固垂頭太息、英國則揚眉吐氣矣、英國素以網球奉爲國家競技、惟自十一年前、被美國擊敗於决賽之後、從此家聲中墮、屈伏人下、然其雄發之志願、固未嘗一日忘也、英雄造時勢、英國竟有今日三比二壓倒美國之舉、以償宿願、惟最大之目標、在乎勝法而獲錦標、今不過小試其技耳、</p>
<p>▲英美帶際全部成績</p>

<p>最初之兩單打、英美各勝一組、其時英國歟論、多半以英國已屆恢復往昔之黄金時代、次日美勝雙打一組、以二比一占先、於是美國方面、已準備高唱凱旋之歌、以祝諸少年之成功、英國希望聲浪、不爲之寂、依舊抱奮鬥必能成功之格方、最後一幕、形勢突轉英國兩單打、均占勝利、得却令治决賽權、從此英國將作進一步之　望、厥在敗法而獲台維斯盃、</p>

<h3>六個星期的雪下生活</h3>
<p>— 楊墨逸</p>
<p>去年十二月六日。英國探險家阿克丁·格太爾。加入英國北極探險隊。乘飛機往格林蘭去探險完畢。除同往者都仍回到他們的出發點外。只有他一個人自願留在那兒過冬天。冀有新的發現。</p>
<p>不意一月四日天際忽然彤雲密佈。鵝掌般的大雪。便開始下降。一夜之間。他的門就完全給雪堵住。無從進出。他便在屋頂另闢一洞當作進出的門。但到了三月十八日那天。就是這個賴以進去的洞。也被雪與冰塊所壅塞。他不得已再闢一洞。可是雪仍是不停的下。而且一天比一天的大。雪花飛舞在怒吼的西北風中。彷彿是幾百萬條的玉龍在酣鬥。所以不到三天。（三月二十一日）他便完全被埋葬在雪底下了。</p>
<p>他的親友們許久没有得到他的信息。在四月初便組織一個救護隊去尋覓他。但失敗了。待四月二十日由華金絲另組織一隊去尋覓。可也失望得很。因爲他們到了格林蘭。一眼望去。除掉雪白無瑕的銀裝世界以外。並不能得到些微關於格太爾的消息。尋了十幾天。他們無意間在飛機上看見兩根微微露出雪面上的旗桿與氣管的尖端。於是他們就在冰角站駐紮下來。在氣管旁大聲的呼喊。而格太爾也在下面歡呼作答。五月五日他們便把埋於雪内六個星期的格太爾從三丈多深的雪房裏掘出來、他是很平安。而且健康如昔。雖然他過了六個星期的囚犯似的生活。直到十一日他們才從格林蘭回來。……</p>
<p>據格太爾說。「我自從三月二十一日完全給雪埋在地下。並不覺得有什麽危險。</p>
<p>有酒喝。有雪茄抽。還有趣味濃厚的小說可以消遣。倒也不煩什麽心。但當那最後一根臘燭向我投最後的光芒以後。我便整日的躺在黑暗中。才覺得有點不對勁兒。可是有什麽辦法呢。惟有安之……到五月五日那天。我正在不耐煩的當兒。我的頭上忽然起了一陣煩於比賽足球時的一種爭鬥似的聲音。我爲它所驚動。便立刻振作起我所有的精神。我又很淸楚的聽得有人在喊着。「喂你不怎樣罷。現在我們已經開始在做救你出險的工作了。」啊。這眞是一件意外的幸運啊。乾脆的說。我壓根兒就以爲在此絶望的境遇中是没有一個人能救我出去。打算等死神殘酷的來宣佈我的末日。倒還爽脆。所以我突然聽得有人來救我。便立刻快樂得忘形。不自主的歡呼起來。並且我告訴你們一件滑稽的事情。就是我從被埋於雪下。以至被救。在此很常久的六個星期内。我並没有片刻離開雪茄。我總是狂抽着。好像離開了雪茄。便立刻要去的一死般。……」</p>
<h3>平漢路歸來</h3>
<p>— 鷄冠</p>
<p>余友顧君。新自平漢路轉隴海歸來。風塵滿面。爲余道平漢路現况。據談我國鐵路。歷年受軍事影響。尤以平漢路之損失爲更烈。現在時局縱略平定。但客運尚未能恢復原狀。旅行此路者。每感受異常之困苦也。</p>
<p>該路向以貨運爲收入大宗。中間所經各站。更推鄭州爲全線之主要點。蓋西北各省之産物。類多取道於此也。近二年間。商業大减。轉運無多。貨旣不足恃。客票亦相形見絀。考其原因。實由災民奇增。加以車輛短少。致成斯種現象。現在自北平開往漢口。每日有特别快車一次。因中間小站不停。且有隨車軍警查察。乘客尚不過於擁擠。但車多敝舊。遠不如津浦。遑論滬寗。而車頭拖力不足。亦未能如期到達。至普通車或區間車。往往非鐵棚車卽悶車。乘客滿坑滿谷。蝨處其中。無異牢獄。在地位不敷時。車頂之上。亦席之而坐。烈日薰蒸。汗如雨下。不顧也。開行常無一定。有規定鐘點在上午。竟相差十餘時始到者。購票之各。時起爭論。然亦無可挽回。蓋據路局中人談。沿途軍車擁塞。每須讓出路軌。實無法疏通云。</p>
<p>余友自北平赴石家莊。備嘗此苦。謂車客擁擠時。仄坐其間。卽便溺亦不能自由。婦女尤感困難。常致蹙額。因此有若干婦女。乘普通車時。率携有空罐數枚。遇内急時。卽潛入褲際。作爲一種排洩之器。事畢加蓋。然後擲諸車外。雖不免略有溺濕。究屬救急之一法。顧君曾所目覩。頗引以爲怪也。</p>
<h3>記蘇滬名人之紈扇大會</h3>
<p>— 朱</p>
<p>吾吳名畫家柳君然先生。嘗從老畫師陳迦庵先生遊。雅擅丹靑。精究六法。所作花鳥蟲魚之作。秀媚横溢。卓然成家。此次覽於各地災祟迭生。惻然心動。乃與陳公迦庵張君叔良發起蘇滬名家書畫紈扇大會。售欵所入。除開支外。悉充善舉。已於十三日起在蘇地宫巷樂君社公開展覽。名畫法書。琳琅滿目。烏可不紀。</p>
<p>劉臨川顔純生蔣宜安三公。吾吳畫苑中之三老也。其所作畫品。俱有古意。惟均年近古稀。惜墨如金。而此次紈扇會中。亦皆有作品陳列臨川之山水。秀逸蒼茫。深得石谷神髓。顔純生之鍾進士圖。持傘張燈。𧳓狽彳亍。其落拓不覊之狀。直將失意人生。描寫盡致。且記以詩云。「不騎駿馬不乘輿。雨滴衣裳汗滴鬚。雲樹蒼茫燈火暗。夜來醒恐鬼椰揄。」尤感慨繫之。蔣宜安之人物。悠然意遠。深入曉樓堂奥。陳迦庵先生宿以蒼老作品問世。此次畫會中。則畫一仕女。婀娜臨風。别具娟媚。尤屬别開生面。而柳君然先生作品。瓜果魚鳥。運筆獨多。更爲該會生色。此外如張仲老李印泉蔣吟秋之書法。顧墨彝樊少雲馬萬里之圖畫。亦亦屬稀有之作。而前輩程小靑先生。亦於百忙中繪一魚樂圖。名作如許。誠藝苑中之盛會也。畫會中紈扇。按扇編號。每劵一元半。並有頭二三奬。每奬贈送四柄。十五日上午當衆抽籤。裙屐扇翻。尤盛極一時云。</p>
<h3>來函</h3>
<p>記者先生。按稿件之轉載。爲法律所許。但從道德上說至少要註明出處及原作者姓氏。方史剽竊之譏。今有國内有名刊物如國聞週刊乃竟將自由談所載有拙所。（十九年十一月六日「政海屑聞」）轉載該報。一字不易。例如「曹廚子」一篇。見該報第八卷第二十五號。不但未註明出處。且易原署名ＵＢ二字爲「綠楊刊上散入」。這種剽竊他人著作爲己有的行爲。是很不道德的。「綠楊刋上散人」世間有無此人。雖不可知。但國聞週報的編輯。應負相當責任。這完全是道德上的責任。因爲若不經本人自己發現。從中的鬼祟行爲。人將以我之一稿兩投爲疑。此函懇代登出。藉當聲明。　弟ＷＵＢ上。</p>
<h3>印度遊記（六四）</h3>
<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>二十七日。教員沙馬南打語余甘地運動。云甘地蓋深得佛心理學而運用之者。甘地曾游佛各地。實行佛之戒殺主義。有人若打蛇。甘地亦不以爲然。因彼亦神所生也。甘地云。若有人侮其妻。彼亦不還報之。惟有向神求其覺悟耳。甘地雖學於英。决非用英之學術。乃發明印度之心理事。大雄無畏之精神。一致不買英貨。英人將餓死。一致抗稅。英人罰不勝罰。而無錢養兵。政会府根基爲之動搖。余按甘地此運動。乃無政府之運動。羣起抗稅。政府何以存在。特吾不解政府何竟無法制之。許多印人語我。以此例。任英人要殺便殺。無抵抗。只是不納稅。不交錢一事。有如人能牽牛强之至水邊。不能强牛必定飲水。蓋用惰性心理學也。學生往往視甘地如神。西人亦敬信之。今才出獄。而又開大會。往見英總督。可謂三蘇復上者也。</p>
<p>印度校有尼泊爾學生。勸余游其國。尼泊爾人秀白與印人異。云其國有蒙古族。殆近華種。與印人亦言尼泊爾族近蒙古種也。云此市有尼泊爾人萬數。尼泊爾爲純粹佛教國云。其父爲該國陸軍長。其叔曾進貢中國。今年八十矣。能華語。現仍習華文。曾在華二年也。從尼泊爾至中國。昔時不走印度。乃走雪山而東。往返一次凡兩年。三年入貢一次。云從此地波羅奈到尼泊爾。凡兩日可到。其地頗寒。近雪山也。並階法師曾游之。云彼處多觀音菩薩像。在印度未之見也。</p>
<p>各教授語我。今印度大决心爲文化復興。並不守古代之舊。乃仿從各方面之大革命。用科學方法努力創造。非振興於全世界不可。願留余住此爲家。以從事全亞洲之團結云。余甚佩其議論。感其高誼。要之波羅奈爲印度古文化中心之地。人心深入文化。尤過於加爾吉打。彼等不甚重加爾吉打在印度文化上之重要也。大抵印度哲學宗教人生上之智識道德。其富厚遠過於今日美國之金錢。在美國選一下等資本家。到各國可居上等。此物質之富也。在印度選一下等哲學智識者。游歷世界。尚足以爲哲學宗教之王。故云佛智如大海。實則佛不過印度之一果。而印度人乃智慧之全樹也。</p>
<p>說部扶輪會</p>
<h3>？？？（二七）</h3>
<p>— 徐卓呆</p>
<p>於是娘姨再到樓下去拿一副碗筷來、子良用小櫈坐在床前，把飯盤代做桌子，與夫人對吃。子良本來不源意吃稀飯；但是倘使他吃了飯，與夫人吃的不同，夫人又要多說話。所以只得將就吃了。這一夜，夫人的粥量很大，一共吃了五碗，子良只吃了兩碗。</p>
<p>吃完了，子良想到亭子問裏去；然而他曉得今夜爲了白鬼問題，恐后不能離開半步了。</p>
<p>稀飯到底是水做的，夫人吃了五碗，自然肚子膨脹，要到床背後去上馬，子良趁此機會，想脫身了：</p>
<p>「臭得很！我到亭子間裏去了。」</p>
<p>「不行！我一個人胆小的！」</p>
<p>子良寸步難行，只得飽受得味。夫人回到床上時：</p>
<p>「冷淸淸的，太寂寞了！你講個笑話給我聽聽罷！」</p>
<p>子良心裏亂極，那裏想得出什麽笑話呢？</p>
<p>「笑話要觸機，此刻想不起來。」</p>
<p>「那末，你在第一隻抽斗裏尋尋，有什麽書？」</p>
<p>子良在抽斗内一尋，尋出三四本書來：</p>
<p>「你要看麽？」</p>
<p>「先告訴我，是什麽書？」</p>
<p>「天方夜談。」</p>
<p>「唷！怕得很！我不要！」</p>
<p>「三國志可要看？」</p>
<p>「好的！」</p>

<p>▲晨初卽開低盤　早間九月份開盤卽降四兩、爲七百四十三兩、大條及銀價各升八分之一私電加十六分之三、次爲二兩半、俄頃志豐永·丙興·福餘·物品等買進、且由銀行互做英金一三六七五、至二五、繼由匯豐掮客吸九月一八七五、故金價亦提漲六兩、然有一兩餘廻轉、至九點二十分爲四十八兩四錢、時有大連帮及元亨物品等售出、兼之九十月份英金可售一八七五至二五、遂卽貶去二兩餘、英金揭佈時爲四十六兩、掛價如前、萬興等買進、略加一兩餘、爲四十七兩五錢、未幾時乾昌祥·源成·恒餘等出售、卽行下遊四兩餘、至十點零爲四十三兩、繼因匯豐買九月英金二五、又以内興·元春等買進、計加四兩、至十點半後爲四十七兩、惟有一兩零盤頭、嗣由同太昌限盤脫售、又元茂永·恒餘等隨買、故跌去三兩、直至十一點半爲四十四兩二錢、片刻間回上一兩數錢、爲四十六兩、零戸買進、至十一點三刻左右印匯報大、遂降至四兩二錢套頭等追購、故午刻收市五兩半、又做至五兩以内、揭價仍爲七百九十二兩六錢、計撳四十五六兩至五十兩、午時四十七八兩、</p>
<p>▲跌落三兩七錢　後市開盤四十四兩五錢、繼爲五兩八錢、乃印匯回小一安那、嗣後略加數錢、爲四十六兩三錢、復退至五兩六七錢、但交易稀少、市况極平、二點半後以在在四十六兩内外、三點後場内零戸俱進、又銀行吃進十月英金一三二五、美金三十元零七五、至三點半爲四十七兩八錢、並傳印匯又小一安那、俄頃又加上七八錢、爲四十七兩六錢、旋由餘大·元亨·潤昌祥等來賣、並以英金可售一八七五至二五、乃削二兩、至四點曾爲四十五兩半、時又加上六七錢、復後餘大·匯源等相約脫售、復處疲境、迨四點三十分收市爲四十三兩三錢、較上週末又跌三兩七錢、而人心恐虛、重又做至四十一兩半左右、萬興·順利則進、卽拉上兩許、按前後兩市最大四十八兩四錢、最小四十二兩半、相差五兩九錢、（照掛牌而言）</p>

<h3>外匯似潛鬆勢</h3>
<p>昨日匯豐掛牌外匯除香港加一二五、計八十兩○二五外餘均勿更、更天銀市雖長、不爲所動、惟英美豐兌均降、至於銀價内盤英美日匯尚無重大變化、似潛鬆勢、自晨卽萎、嗣則平定、下午站住、結果比上週六、計英金長○六二五、美金長一二五、日金减七五、殆金市略爲低落、然未特殊榮辱、而華商交易不暢、計英金稍有結進、匯豐及日商鎊行亦有納進、約成交二十萬鎊、又美金約計廿餘萬元、匯豐買意不寂、而日金僅以數十萬元出納、</p>

<h3>洋厘驟見起色</h3>
<p>▲市場概况　昨日洋交雖不甚盛、而客路略有、近百萬之去胃、故各方面氣象增色不少、而市價因以添籌矣、至於銀拆市况、依然如舊、無善足陳、</p>
<p>▲釐拆價格　（洋釐）早市爲七錢二分六釐、午市爲六釐二毫半結果較前日早市共好八毫一上海各廠、遠期新棉已抛出約有三萬多擔。故在所中拖進不放、至於各地新棉生産狀况、尚未有詳細消息、棉市前途、仍乏把握也、</p>
<p>▲漢標漲二三錢　交易所　標前市開盤、美棉平平、而紗市稍佳、賣戸减少、各漲五分至二錢、午後又漲一錢、成交計三萬六千四百擔、查賣出愼昌一千五百擔、源大一千九百擔、買進天降二千六百擔、公泰三千四百擔、元泰一千二百擔、榮興一千三百擔、茲將漢標收盤價錄左、</p>

<h3>英印棉業週訊</h3>
<p>▲孟買　上週市况、雖因國外趨勢不定、套賣市價仍穩、較前週漲起四羅比、據報交易旺盛、日商除白羅溪及陶勒拉外、更購各種奥姆辣、現貨方面、本地廠家尚有成交、歐洲大陸商頗形靜寂、天氣順利、附錄上週統計如下、（單位千包）</p>

<p>▲利物浦　上週現需平和、期貨方面、交易雖勤、實在營業不多、保守商人似有等待發展之勢、場中人心樂觀、惟市况仍微、埃及棉市價隨美棉爲上落、</p>
<h3>糧食　河下米市跌勢續厲</h3>
<p>▲新閘　昨日裏路來船不多、零碎去化以高普二種爲最健、店方以在靑黄不接檔口、添辦積貨、行情上落有限、常熟·崑山·宜興·等厚粳、過問者稀少、大盤提高殺次、早晚稻來貨略有、河積及米廠存貨尚多、形勢低落尺許、洋蘆尖略有開出、價尚堅定、變隂元到銷二敵、價照原盤、</p>
<p>▲商市　來源寥落、浦存宿貨稍有、城鄉店銷懈淡、買胃亦薄、厚粳行情續修角許、薄稻到積略有、寗胃仍呆、本街所去、均揀鮮暴之貨、致價高者勉撑、次則逐疲、蘆洋尖貨稀胃平、無升沉、變隂元仍居盤旋之態、</p>
<h3>現粉日銷銳退</h3>
<p>▲期貨尚稱平穩</p>
<p>昨日洋麥報價回小二角左右、粉市人心、初開頗覺不振、七八月份約小近分、遠期則五釐至七釐半不等、惟以後各盤、因金價仍見擯局、一時難小、人心又復逐堅、但以實際言、北銷之天津、已經轉寂、日銷已退至三萬外、或者後步尚有問題也、結果本月份較前週小二釐半、八月份小七厘半、九·十·十一月份未動、十二月份好二厘半</p>
<h3>麥市盤旋中帶昂勢</h3>
<p>▲謠傳俄麥有樣寄申</p>
<p>昨日期麥市面、以各處患水之後、内地人心、始終堅硬、未肯輕易回出、一部空戸因市面擯住不小、曾略有補進、所以各月份盤旋之中稍帶昂勢、惟市上謠傳、俄麥有樣寄申、頗有兜售之意、是否事實、後步當有確息也、結果本月份較前週好一分、八月份好三分、九月份好一分、十·十一月份好二分、十二月份未動、現麥市面、因廠胃尚活、内地報價亦略昂、高貨喊價好二三分、市較穩定、開邵伯·丹陽·揚州·南京·采石浦鎭·六合麥共三千五百包、由福新·華豐·信大·祥新等辦去云、</p>
<h3>絲茶　廠經美銷停頓</h3>
<p>滬白廠經、美銷停滯已久、紐約等埠、入夏後氣候奇熱、絲織廠一致暫停暑假、生絲有行無市、絲電昨仍不轉、英法銷胃亦淸、昨祇泰和進滬白廠經十包、信孚進黄廠經五包、達昌進白乾經十包、價均堅定云、</p>
<h3>無錫新夏繭運到五十担</h3>
<p>無錫各屬、今歲夏蠶備肥天時之損害、收成奇歡、各市鄉繭産幾等於零、繭行開秤者少、幾無繭市之可言、各行收數祇及春繭十之三、繭市早已結束、新夏乾繭、昨日已有五十擔運滬、爲横林及八士橋等處之貨、現已上棧待售云、</p>
<h3>無色大帮茶美銷活動</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊茶市、平水路莊兩路之無色大帮茶、運銷美國之錦降洋行、因得前途來電需求、進意又趨濃厚、全市談成四千餘箱、扯價五十七八兩、較前仍無上落、針眉·秀眉·珠茶等項、法銷暢達、售盤亦堅挺、惟珍眉一項、僅抽芯貨略有零星交易、婺源屯溪之普通貨、去路依然呆滯云、</p>
<h3>南北貨　靑笋干價已廉宜</h3>
<p>靑笋干自登場以來近以來源湧旺、銷方觀望少進、是以行家售盤欲遷就買方起見、不得不逐步减低、現市如高檔上上秃挺、每　售價已跌至七錢許、以往常市價而論、已屬低盤　且聞地頭貨底將近斷檔、而山客皆遭虧本、一致不願賤售、故看勢决難再鬆、並有回好希望云、</p>
<h3>糖市日糖今日起實行停市</h3>
<p>▲太古糖開盤漲而且俏</p>
<p>昨日糖市産區電訊、仍無到來、公會市場劃盤荷糖二十四號粗砂白市氣頗堅、出戸殊缺、喊價十一兩五錢、旋以號盤略有開出、成交價爲十一兩四錢二分半、市形頗挺、二十號中砂白十一兩、需要較靜、太古糖現貨B嘜劃價十一兩、HM嘜十一兩三錢、H嘜十兩○六錢、市且俏俐、八月份期貨該公司昨開出五千包、DY嘜價日金四元八角半、B嘜五元○五分、午後續開二千餘包、價格又升五分、後首更須扳高、漲風似尚未已、日糖以抵制關係、已無活動地步、故行方皆願削價脫手、跌勢殊烈、N嘜十一兩一錢半至○五分YT嘜十一兩一錢至十一兩、YR○嘜十兩○九、錢、最低至○八錢、TM嘜十兩、TX嘜十一兩三錢至二錢半、YP嘜十一兩五錢半至三錢半、AE嘜十一兩四錢、市形萎弱、又該業公會、召集同業大會、爲對日經濟絶交起見、今日起市場上實行停止日糖營業矣、又號盤有禎祥號售開現貨粗砂白一千袋、價仍十一兩四錢二分半、市頗俏秀、尚具逐升之跡云、</p>
<h3>油市　洪江桐油伏銷萌動</h3>
<p>洪江桐油、正伏銷當令之時、蓋春銷時縱有暢旺、係店家備貨爲多、而夏令之伏銷乃是實用、</p>
<p>近晴雨不定、頗有黄梅時節景象、然天氣漸炎、陽光不歛、農人以種田之後、得雨暘時、若隴畔無事、正好從事髹漆、因此伏銷漸見發動、滬上號家初鑒於江浙蠶汛不佳、深恐銷有减色、不敢多備、旋見暢銷如故、急於籌備、無如産地遠在湘省西南、始傳中途受阻、致客家不肯預售、鎭江行家亦因之勒緊、近雖證實、湘西並非完全阻斷、然遲緩有所不能免、途中之貨、能否供夏令之銷、實不敢必、故來源之稀尠、已可確定、鎭行來函已屢屢詳之、而滬上號家初尚未信、嗣見到貨不接、始信無疑、幸現在手貨未薄、尚足供各處所求、不致有左支右絀之虞也、</p>
<h3>五金　馬口鐵盛極而衰</h3>
<p>馬口鐵市面在上前二月因供不應求　市象飛黄騰達、售盤激增、近因到源踴躍、兼之霉訊關係、各廠停辦、客帮亦因當地市面欠佳、無力收進、所以市面逐步趨疲、標準回風甚勁、行情九十磅英貨祇估十四兩五錢、美貨十六兩、一百磅英貨十五兩五錢、美貨十七兩、二百磅會司鐵三十一兩、比之前市猛跌一兩至五兩不等、而交易仍覺冷落、人心暗疲、後市殊難樂觀也、</p>
<h3>新鉛絲新到七百餘捆</h3>
<p>新鉛絲交易、邇來仍無進展氣象、良以客銷淡薄、積存盈豐所致、惟新貨昨新太古棧又到七百餘捆、存底愈厚、而市象愈呆、但東洋貨因制抵關係、已無來申之可能、苟北帮及長江路生意發動、市况甚許樂觀、行情十六號至二十號售十三兩五錢、二十一號至二十五號十八兩七錢半云、</p>
<h3>雜訊　日本米五千包到滬</h3>
<p>▲東糖一千九百件大阪運來、</p>

<h3>捕房對梁成玉上訴</h3>
<p>▲糾正原審判决謬誤</p>
<p>▲昨日開審辯論終結</p>
<p>總巡捕房總稽查處兩號華探目魯人梁成玉、因對於本年四月廿八號晚十一時重慶路馬樂里四百卅九號門牌李連生家被刦値洋五萬元之嗎啡案有關、被工部局以刑法三百四十八條强盜罪起訴於特區地方法院、業經葛推事數度鞫訊、於六月二日宣告梁成玉無罪、而李連生因有綁架李惠卿之嫌疑、亦經捕房起訴、現尚在改期偵查中、但捕房對於梁成玉搶刦嗎啡案無罪部份、不服判决、由工部局代理律師博良·汝葆彝·列舉理由、具狀向江蘇高等分院提起上訴、</p>
<p>▲上訴理由四點　昨晨十一時、由高分院刑庭長宋沅·偕堵·高·兩推事升座集訊·被上訴人梁成玉、仍延葉茀康·袁仰安·彭解·三律師到庭代辯、首由捕房代表律師汝葆彝起稱本案初審時、捕房卽根據刑法三四八條强盜罪、向特院起訴、當時所有證據、捕房亦已盡量提出、而被上訴人亦提出反證、證明其是晚所作之事、結果原審判决被上訴人無罪捕房於接到判决書後、詳察之下、認爲有極大錯悞、故向鈞院請求救濟其錯悞理由、可分爲下列之四點、（一）原判謂「被告矢口不認、」查凡被告意圖脫罪狡賴者多是、故除能提出有力之反證外、其空言否認、不能採取、而本案之告訴人李連生·及其姘婦張阿四·之供詞、關係最重、雖經迭次隔别訊問、然二人對於搶刦嗎啡及前後情形、言之歷歷、若合符節、且告訴人在捕房内能於人叢中立卽指認被告爲刦案中之强盜、顯見事非虛搆、（二）原判又謂李連生與張阿四所供情詞歧異之點、不一而足、如李供「我想起來、是張先生通風、因手槍自搶過後、看他送至被告家内、我女人張阿四釘梢去的、」而張供「手槍是張姓女人說是成都路七五六號拏來、」此種重要事項、竟出入如此云云、查以上二人之供詞、雖微有不同、然實質上絲毫無異、蓋張所供之成都路七五六號、卽係李所供之被告家内、大約原審執筆下判之際、未曾注意被告住所、所以致認爲歧異、况細按筆錄、二人供詞、同者居多、措辭間雖或稍有出入、然亦無關宏旨、惟原審略其多數之同、而採其偶有之異、且明明同者不一而足、乃曰異者不一而足、採證之際、旣違證據法之原理、則其判决、自難準確而公平、（三）原判决又謂張阿四初至捕房、誤指一百十號華探沈天寳爲被告、遂據以爲辨認不明、不足採爲證據、但當時捕房内有華探五六人站在一處、各將標記卸除、故張阿四初指一百十號、後知錯悞、乃卽行改正、此係人情之常、當然有改正之可能、（四）原判又謂李連生挾嫌一節、不爲無因、當時被上訴人主張李連生卽方連生、又名小連生、與李惠卿綁案有關、彼數往拘捕未獲、致遭挾嫌誣攀等詞、查此案李連生當時并未報告捕房、係由捕房探知此案發生、乃加以詳密之調查、嗣在法租界將李查獲、并非李自投捕房、至李因何不報捕房之原因、實因李有私藏嗎啡及搶刦之事、均爲犯法行爲、且或恐對於綁案有關、故未報捕、及至將其拘獲、因不能推諉、始行吐露、八晚又將其姘婦拘獲、故原審認爲挾嫌一層、殊不適當、綜觀判决全文、不外此四點理由、但捕房方面、認爲不合、且當時已有充分證據提出、足以證明被上訴人搆成犯罪、因此提起上訴云、</p>
<p>▲梁成玉仍否認　宋庭長乃詢被上訴人梁成玉云、李連生指你搶刦嗎啡、有此事乎、梁答李連生卽方連生、又名小連生、對於綁架李惠卿案有關、余曾兩次會同西探長亨特、華探長劉紹奎、往法租界甘司東路拘捕未獲、初次在二月十三四號、第二次約越三星期、可以調查、余對於搶刦嗎啡之事、完全不知、宋庭長遂詢汝律師、對於此點、曾否調查、汝律師起稱、二月十五號、被上訴人確曾與西探往法界調查、但無結果、且祇此一次、宋君又問梁曰、成都路李連生家你去過否、答、未、問、四月二十八號晚、遠東旅館後面小客棧内、你到過嗎、答、未、問、此事如何發覺、答、此時余已告假、因接到山東原籍電報、余父親身故、乃向西探長請假、至五月四號、被西探長喊至捕房云云、</p>
<p>▲李連生之供詞　繼據李連生供、向業五金掮客、張阿四係我姘婦、家中尚有老母妻子、現居浦東洋涇原籍、三月十一日、有師兄弟徐根根者、謂有嗎啡、暫寄我處、託我同居携取、乃與徐及張姓等同往、我在馬路上、若輩入弄内、未幾取出四箱、初至大沽路友人處、因被人窟破、乃至濺水路合興坊、繼又遷至跑馬廳、末始搬至我家重慶路馬樂里三四九號樓上客堂樓内、該處房屋、係臨時租就、月租十五元、至晚十一時、忽聞有人敲前門、問連生在家否、我尚未答應、若輩卽從後門入内、逕登我室、共六人、被上訴人梁成玉執槍向我恐嚇、謂　相些、我等係捕房探員、連將嗎啡交出、當給汝三千元、我來允、當被將嗎啡一箱先行搬去、回來時、手提包袱、又將其餘三箱裝於包袱内、携之而出、距因時在深夜、被弄口司閣捕所阻、乃折回、將我與姘婦押至小客棧監視、直至天明、始押同張阿四回家、將其餘嗎啡取去云云、又據張阿四供述一過、其供詞與李連生略同、從略、</p>
<p>▲董蘭亭之證言　又據證人董蘭、亭證稱與梁成玉爲友、四月二十七八九、三日晚間七時至九時、余與梁曾在法租界昇平里相遇、因梁父身故、彼接到電報、欲回故鄉、託余照顧其家、至十二時之前相别、餘事不知、</p>
<p>▲雙方雄辯一場　至此人證已畢、乃開始辯論、由被上訴人之律師葉茀康、彭解、袁仰安、等三人及捕房律師汝葆彝、相繼起立、竭力辯論、一時唇槍舌劍、各逞雄辯、約歷一時餘、始行畢其辯詞、末由鄭檢察官起而發表意見、略謂察核本案情形、事實均已明瞭、查被上訴人方面之證人所稱、對於被上訴人四月二十八日之事、不能確切證明、且被上訴人所提出之電報一份、實係事前先行預備、以作犯罪時卸責之用、應請依法判决、宋庭長核禀、遂諭辯論終結、定期二十七號上午宣判、梁成玉收押、不准交保、迨訊畢已二時有半矣、</p>

<h3>Studying Japan (3)</h3>
<p>Since the Opium War, our country began to be startled by the formidability of the Western powers and ashamed of being inferior to them. All of the Western powers' political systems, institutions, cultures, and military equipment were collectively referred to as "Western affairs." Those who adhered to the old ways regarded them as the ways of barbarians, not worth learning from. Those who advocated reform only learned the superficial aspects, without investigating the reality. Those who were deeply worried and ignorant of the times regarded Western affairs as a mystery, like metaphysics, saying that they could not be understood by ordinary people. Li Hongzhang, who claimed to be familiar with Western affairs, also believed that our country's politics, education, customs, and habits were all superior to other countries, and that the only thing we were inferior in was guns and cannons. We only need to learn this, and we will have mastered all the skills of Western affairs. This superficial view can truly represent a glimpse of the observation of the international situation at that time. Before the Sino-Japanese War, Bismarck of Germany once said, "In the competition between China and Japan, Japan will surely win and China will surely lose... because the Japanese who come to Europe discuss various academic subjects, study political principles, and seek to return to the country for fundamental reforms. The Chinese who come to Europe only ask how well the ships and cannons of a certain factory are made, how expensive or cheap they are, and buy them back for use, and that's it." Bismarck's argument was a true assessment of the superficiality of our country's observation of Western civilization at that time. However, even today, some shallow-minded people still believe that our country has a vast land, abundant resources, and a large population, and is a civilized ancient country of five thousand years. The only thing we are inferior to Japan is its naval, land, and air forces. This superficial view is the same in ancient and modern times. This is what we should deeply recognize today. Observing a country should not be based on its superficial national power, but on examining its foundation. Just as an architect observes a house, he does not immediately determine it to be a solid house based on its magnificent exterior decorations. He must also examine every brick and every beam, and investigate the nature and structure of all the materials. Only then can he fully understand everything about this house.</p>
<p>His remarks are appropriate and pertinent. Our study of Japan is the same. We must examine its national character, understand its life, and then study its culture, institutions, and the trend of its changes, and predict its future. Only then can we truly understand Japan. Guns and cannons are certainly not something our country can match, but what else is there that can restrain Japan's weaknesses? Mr. Dai Jitao once said, "The Japanese have dissected the topic of China thousands of times on the dissecting table and analyzed it thousands of times in test tubes. However, we Chinese only know how to reject and oppose it, and are unwilling to do any research. We are almost unwilling to even look at Japanese characters, listen to Japanese, or meet Japanese people. This is truly called intellectual isolationism and intellectual Boxerism." His words are painfully accurate. In short, to establish a country in the modern era, we should conduct a thorough and penetrating study of the international situation, whether it is the Soviet Union, England, America, or France... in order to devise countermeasures. This is even more obvious and urgent in the case of Japan. Our country's experts should quickly catch up, put the Japanese issue on the dissecting table, put it in test tubes, observe its phenomena with a microscope, and look to its future with a telescope. Now is the time.</p>

<p>▲ "National News" Berlin, 20th – It was announced today that German Chancellor Brüning has invited French Prime Minister Laval and Foreign Minister Briand to visit Germany, and both have accepted. Furthermore, although the meeting in Paris yielded no concrete results, government officials this morning viewed the situation with greater optimism than before, believing that the French-German talks have cleared up some misunderstandings and created a better atmosphere for the London Conference.</p>

<p>▲ "National News" Paris, 19th – Before leaving Paris for London this evening, German Chancellor Brüning issued a grave warning, stating that Germany's financial crisis must be resolved quickly. He said that if no remedies are found within a week, he could not foresee the consequences. Mr. Brüning issued this warning after the conclusion of the international conference. A later published communiqué declared that during the conference, German Chancellor Brüning reported on the situation in Germany and suggested ways to resolve the financial crisis. Subsequently, French Prime Minister Laval moved that the London Conference should be strictly limited to discussing Germany's financial and economic matters, which was approved by the conference. Consequently, the French authorities agreed to attend the conference in London. It is currently unknown what plans the authorities of the various countries will discuss in London tomorrow. However, as the heads of France and Germany have discussed political issues in Paris in a relatively harmonious and frank manner, it is believed that it will not be difficult to agree on a rescue plan.

<h3>Mexicans Expel Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>Raiding the Residences of Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>Consul Lodges Protest</p>
<p>▲ "National News Agency", Nogales, 19th – In the Mexican border town of Mascareñas, 120 Mexicans from the Anti-Chinese Committee suddenly attacked the residences of five overseas Chinese families today, looting a large sum of cash and two guns. Consul Yao of the Chinese consulate in Nogales has lodged protests with the Mexican federal government and the government of the state of Sonora, respectively. Almost all the general stores in the state of Sonora are run by overseas Chinese. There is now talk of a strike to protest. If the Anti-Chinese Committee continues to attack overseas Chinese and force them to strike, the residents of the entire state will be in danger of running out of food. The cause of the incident is due to harsh laws promulgated by the authorities, requiring that 80% of the employees in stores and farms run by Easterners must be Mexican. Because the overseas Chinese found Mexican wages too high and were unable to hire the required number, the Anti-Chinese Committee accused them of evading the law and resorted to violence.</p>

<h3>The Red Peril and China's Survival (Continued)</h3>
<p>Yang Xingfo</p>
<p>The Communists' distribution of land and resistance to rent are merely temporary means to lure peasants. Therefore, it is called a preliminary policy of in-depth land revolution. At the same time, fearing that the peasants would realize that the land they were dividing was merely a fleeting mirage, they vigorously prohibited party members from proposing the slogan "Confiscate all land," advocating for a communal farming system (i.e., a state-owned farm to realize the communist system) and using government laws or party resolutions to prohibit the sale and lease of land. The reason given is that these measures would alienate the Communist Party from the broad masses of peasants nationwide (see the current work plan for Soviet areas). However, the ultimate goal of the Communist Party's land program remains the elimination of landlords and the private land system and the realization of state ownership of land. The peasants who divide the land are merely straw dogs in the process of the party's land revolution. As for the Communist Party members retaining fertile land for themselves when distributing land or favoring relatives and friends, and still levying extremely heavy land taxes, these are obvious abuses that are not worth discussing.</p>
<p>The Communist Party's policy on popular organizations is to use the benefits of the land revolution to attract the basic masses in the countryside, the poor peasants, farm laborers, and coolies, to be the main force for their armed uprisings and class struggle. They temporarily maintain contact with middle peasants and completely oppose wealthy peasants, striving to exclude the wealthy peasant component from the government and all armed organizations. The benefits used to attract poor peasants, tenant farmers, and coolies are, in fact, taken from the wealthy peasants. If wealthy peasants also have political power and participate in armed organizations, then class struggle will inevitably lead to internal strife, and the distribution of benefits will be impossible. Popular organizations in the bandit areas, in both rural villages and cities, include handicraft workers' unions and coolies' unions. In addition, there are industrial workers' unions and shop employees' unions specifically in towns, and farm laborers' unions, poor peasant associations, and poor people's associations specifically in rural areas. Among them, farm laborers' unions are the most important. The Communist Party recognizes them as one of the important tools for realizing the leadership of the proletariat in the current democratic revolution. Each union is organized based on industry or occupation, with the district as the unit, and then there are village branches, general unions, and even the general union of the entire special zone. The general union prefixed with the name of a county or special city is composed of the general unions of various industries in urban and rural areas. The Communist Party also fully utilizes bandits and vagrants. The method is "to attract bandits and vagrant masses to obtain the benefits of the land revolution. The best way is to dissolve their inherent organizations, distribute land to them, and resolve their reactionary leaders, that is, to sympathize with revolutionary leaders, and at least not let him lead the original troops" (see the current work plan for the Soviet area). The secret societies of the Hongjiang Society and the Three Dots Society are all welcomed by them. The so-called slogan of welcoming Hongjia brothers refers to this. Although the Hong Gang forces in Jiangxi have declined recently, they provide red bandits with reconnaissance and information, which causes some disadvantage to the government troops. In addition, the Communist Party also absorbs old-style peasant armed organizations, such as the Small Swords Society and the Red Spears Society, as much as possible. Their method of dealing with them is similar to that of dealing with secret societies and bandits.</p>
<p>The Process of Suppressing the Reds – The Red Peril in China is most severe in the three provinces of Jiangxi, Hubei, and Hunan. Among the three provinces, Jiangxi is the most severe. The military strength of the Red bandits is almost entirely concentrated in Jiangxi. When Fang Zhimin and Shao Shiping fled from Nanchang to Yiyang in the 16th year of the Republic (1927) during the Kuomintang's anti-communist campaign, they only carried seven guns. Now, the 10th Army of the Red Army under Fang Zhimin has more than 10,000 men and more than 2,000 guns. When Zhu De fled from Jiangxi to Hunan in the 16th year of the Republic (1927) and joined Mao Zedong, the number of guns was only two or three hundred. Now, the troops under Zhu De have more than 30,000 men and more than 10,000 guns. The speed at which the Red bandit forces have expanded can be seen from this. Three years ago, a small rabble of men now requires the mobilization of the country's troops, and Generalissimo Chiang himself has to go to the front lines before there is hope of extermination. Could this be what the sellers of local interests at the time dreamed of? Jiangxi has been afflicted by the Red Peril for nearly four years, and the active suppression of the Reds only began after the campaign against Yan and Feng. The influence of the civil war on the suppression of the Reds can be seen from this again.</p>
<p>The suppression of the Reds in Jiangxi can be divided into three periods: the first period was the period of suppression by Lu Diping; the second period was the period of suppression by He Yingqin; and the third period was the period of suppression by Chiang Kai-shek. In the 18th year of the Republic (1929), when Lu Diping was in charge of Jiangxi, he originally had troops from the 18th, 50th, 12th, and 3rd Divisions. Using these troops to suppress the Reds should have been able to cope. Subsequently, due to the re-emergence of the civil war, the 50th and 12th Divisions were transferred out of the province, leaving only the 18th and 13th Divisions to guard Jiangxi. The Red flames then spread daily, and more than 60 counties in Jiangxi were ravaged. The provinces of Hunan and Hubei all had troops stationed with the responsibility of suppressing the Reds, but each guarded its own boundaries and refused to cross the Lei River a step, so the bandits were able to move freely in the three provinces. Since the end of the military campaign against Yan and Feng last autumn, the Red Peril had become a prairie fire. The government then ordered the 50th and 12th Divisions to return to Jiangxi and transferred elite troops of about 17 divisions, totaling more than 100,000 men, to be under the command of Lu Diping. Although this campaign recovered the counties of Ji'an, the 18th Division was surrounded and annihilated in the bandit area, and the division commander, Zhang Huijiong, was captured and killed. The 50th Division was also badly defeated, losing more than half of its troops. The bandit forces revived. Although the reasons for the failure of this campaign are very complex, they can be seen from the six points mentioned by Brigade Commander Dai Yue: (1) The troops are frequently transferred, so that the remnant bandits who are about to be exterminated can revive; (2) The bandit suppression troops do not understand the situation and organization in the bandit areas; (3) The bandit suppression troops harbor sectarian views, intending to perfunctorily and not earnestly and thoroughly handle the suppression; (4) The county magistrates are incompetent and corrupt, the police discipline is poor, harassing the people everywhere, and the local bullies exploit and oppress the people, causing the people to suffer injustice and resentment, and to take risks; (5) The party, government, army, and people cannot cooperate effectively and consistently to eliminate the Communist bandits; (6) The rural economy is bankrupt, handicraft workers are unemployed, and the people's livelihoods are difficult. Coupled with the Communist bandits' enticements and threats, the number of poor people who follow them is increasing daily (see Dai's "A Little Contribution to Bandit Suppression and Village Cleansing").</p>
<p>After the failure of the first phase of bandit suppression, the government knew that the bandit forces were rampant and could not be ignored. It also realized that the failure of this campaign was due to the lack of unified command, so it sent Minister of Military Affairs He Yingqin to act as Commander-in-Chief and to oversee the suppression in Jiangxi. After arriving in Jiangxi in February of this year, He took the strategy of Zeng Guofan, "steady progress and gradual advancement," based on the miscalculation of underestimating the enemy and going deep in the past. At the same time, he also had considerable plans for reorganizing the local areas, gathering refugees, and establishing county defense groups. There was also considerable progress in the military sphere. In May, the two Guangdong provinces became independent, and the bandit forces revived. Sun Lianzhong, Gong Bingfan, and Wang Jinyu's troops were successively defeated, and Hu Zuyu was killed while supervising the battle. At this point, the Central Government knew that it would be difficult to achieve the effect of suppression without using all its strength to suppress the Reds. People from all walks of life began to pay attention to the Red Peril in Jiangxi, Hubei, and Hunan. Generalissimo Chiang resolutely came to Jiangxi to oversee the suppression, and the elite of the country's troops gathered in Jiangxi. The third phase of the bandit suppression work began in July. At present, the number of troops and guns in the National Army in Jiangxi is more than 300,000. According to recent reports, Chen Mingshu on the right wing attacked Donggu, Sun Lianzhong in the center attacked Ningdu, and He Yingqin on the left wing attacked Guangchang, all making steady progress. The bandit suppression in this phase should be able to achieve the final victory according to the planned plan. However, the fundamental elimination of the Red bandits may not be realized in the short term, and it cannot rely solely on the military force of the army.</p>
<p>Discussion - The Red Peril today is not only a catastrophe since the establishment of the Republic of China, but also an unprecedented change in China for thousands of years. Social evolution changes when it reaches its end. Feudal system and patriarchal society China will disappear with the emperors and warlords. Will it be replaced by an independent and free China of the Three Principles of the People, or a Communist China that is a dependency of Soviet Russia? This is what all the people of the country, regardless of gender or age, should ask themselves. The military victory of suppressing the Reds is only a temporary solution. There are myriad aspects to military post-war management. If the people's livelihoods cannot be resolved and local politics cannot be improved, even without the Red bandits, how can the country last long? Moreover, local tyrants, corruption, and poverty are the breeding grounds for the Red Peril. Therefore, to fundamentally eliminate the Red bandits, the only way is to implement the Three Principles of the People. To implement the Three Principles of the People, there must be a long period of domestic peace. Today's political views inside and outside the party, no matter how different, are all details compared to the issue of national survival. We should strive to communicate and avoid civil war in order to promote the great unity of the country and jointly face the national crisis. Otherwise, it will either be Outer Mongolia under the aegis of Soviet Russia, or Korea under the trampling of the violent Japanese. I hope that my countrymen will not dismiss my words as irrelevant.

<p>News Highlights</p>
<h3>Central and National Government Memorial Week</h3>
<p>▲ Cai Yuanpei Reports on the Wanxian Case and the Japanese</p>
<p>▲ Yu Youren Reports on the Suppression of Communist Bandits</p>
<p>▲ Central Party Headquarters: July 20th, 9:00 AM. The Central Party Headquarters held its 120th Memorial Week meeting in the Grand Auditorium. Attendees included Central Committee members Cai Yuanpei, Ding Weifen, Fang Juehui, Chen Lifu, Miao Peicheng, Yu Jingtang, and others, as well as staff from various departments and guests, totaling over 500 people. Ding Weifen chaired the meeting. After the salutations, Cai Yuanpei reported that the Wanbaoshan Incident originated from Koreans forcibly occupying farmland belonging to Chinese farmers and digging canals to divert water. Rioters in several places in Korea, including Pyongyang, Seoul, Incheon, Jinampo, Busan, Kaiyuan, Wonsan, and Sinuiju, indiscriminately slaughtered overseas Chinese. While some believe this was solely due to the agitation from the Wanbaoshan Incident, limiting it to a conflict between China and Korea, the underlying situation is more complex. On June 1st, the Changchun County government sent officials to persuade the Koreans to leave, but they refused. The officials then took eight of their leaders to the county office, where they confessed to being ordered by the Japanese to cultivate rice. On the 3rd, the Koreans involved in the expulsion process were driven out, but on the 4th, 100 Koreans were still working in the area, protected by five Japanese police officers. This shows that the land rental and canal digging were initiated entirely by the Japanese. After the Chinese farmers spontaneously filled the moats and destroyed the dikes, the Japanese police opened fire with live ammunition and increased their military police presence to over 500, which is even more evident. As for the atrocities in various places in Korea, they were incited by Japanese newspapers beforehand and condoned by police officials during the event. On the 4th, Japanese newspapers in Incheon, Korea, suddenly reported that Korean farmers in Wanbaoshan were massacred by Chinese farmers and that the Northeast authorities had ordered the expulsion of Korean residents. Koreans were greatly alarmed. That evening, Koreans held a city meeting to discuss the issue of Korean residents being persecuted. The Japanese authorities usually strictly prohibit Koreans from holding meetings, especially mass gatherings, but this time it was specially permitted. Uninformed Koreans became greatly indignant and marched in groups to the Chinese district to protest. Japanese police stood by and did nothing to stop them. The crowd threw stones near the Incheon Chinese Chamber of Commerce, damaging shops and initiating a conflict with the Chinese. Koreans then launched a large-scale attack on various Chinese shops. Some Korean intellectual groups distributed leaflets urging the crowd not to riot, but the Japanese police prevented them from doing so. The Japan Chronicle, a Japanese newspaper published in Kobe by a British man named Young, commented in its editorial on the 9th that the Pyongyang riot was the most violent, with dozens of Chinese people brutally beaten to death on the streets. The Japanese side cunningly claimed that the Japanese police were unable to stop it, in an attempt to shirk responsibility. During the brewing of the riot on the 3rd, rumors spread rampant in various places in Korea. What is most noteworthy is that Japanese people living among the overseas Chinese in Pyongyang had already moved elsewhere beforehand. On Saturday and Sunday, anti-Chinese riots broke out in Pyongyang, Seoul, Jemulpo, and Wonsan. That morning, the Chinese Consul-General in Korea personally went to the Governor-General's office, requesting protection for the overseas Chinese and warning the Japanese authorities of the spreading riots. The Seoul Chinese Chamber of Commerce also issued the same warning. Japanese officials all remained indifferent. Furthermore, the Tokyo Hochi Shimbun reported that the violent Pyongyang attack on Chinese people was premeditated. The ringleaders, who used a gathering on the 5th (Sunday) to discuss and direct the rioters inside a Christian church, all carried annotated maps indicating the locations of Chinese families. Police squads followed behind them. The ringleaders instructed the rioters with three rules: advance fiercely when encountering police officers, be cautious when encountering military police, and retreat when encountering the military. They also issued strict orders not to lay a finger on the Japanese. Therefore, in Pyongyang, where anti-Japanese sentiment was supposedly at its highest and unity was paramount, not a single Japanese person was harmed. Based on the above, it is sufficient to prove that the Japanese not only condoned this riot, but actually instigated and directed it. On the 6th, a Reuters dispatch stated that political circles in Tokyo were deeply distressed by the anti-Chinese military actions in Korea and feared that they would lead to a major disaster. This is because over 500,000 Koreans are scattered throughout Manchuria and Mongolia, and if the Chinese are provoked and take retaliatory action, the Chinese authorities will find it difficult to protect them, and the Japanese side will be unable to provide cover, which may lead to a major incident. These major incidents are what the Japanese hope for, as they will use the excuse of the Chinese authorities' inability to protect them to dispatch troops to protect their overseas residents, in order to fulfill their desire to invade Manchuria and Mongolia. Unexpectedly, the Chinese people are no longer as foolish as they were during the Boxer Rebellion. They all understand the meaning of having a cause for their grievances and a target for their debts, and have developed the habit of being gentle when appropriate and unyielding when necessary. They have always recognized the Koreans as victims and do not hate them. As for the Japanese, they feel that there are a few who understand things a little better, and do not regard all of them as enemies. All the Japanese people's schemes of self-inflicted injury have not worked. This recent goal of the Japanese people naturally stems from a consistent plan. Their plan is to implement a kind of immigration policy in Manchuria and Mongolia. When Goto, President of the South Manchuria Railway Company, was in office, he had a plan to immigrate three million people to Manchuria and Mongolia within twenty years, and said that if the immigration policy succeeds, the three eastern provinces will de facto become Japanese territory. The Japanese once made a chart and hung it everywhere: "Japan has 43,700 square miles and 85 million people; Manchuria has 65,000 square miles and 28 million people." Later, because the experiment of relocating Japanese residents failed, they changed their plan and moved Koreans to the three eastern provinces and Japanese to Korea. Japan wants to relocate Koreans, first by tricking them out of their property, making them homeless. The police station, based on household registration surveys, registers unemployed people one by one and finds ways to help them. When a certain period of time comes and a considerable number is reached, they announce the immigration plan, send them to Manchuria and Mongolia to cultivate land, and force them to register with the Japanese consulate, prohibit them from paying taxes to the Chinese authorities, and encourage them to resist the Chinese authorities. If Koreans suffer any losses due to conflicts between China and Korea, they immediately make demands for compensation, hoping to create a tense situation that may lead to actual war. Now the diplomatic organs have already made representations according to law regarding the massacre, and civil groups have advocated economic severance, but to completely resolve it, it is necessary to unite the strength of the whole country and work from the ground up. The basic work, first, is investigation and research, knowing yourself and your enemy, and you will win every battle. Second, is enrichment. As the saying goes, "Goods are hated when they are thrown on the ground," and "Careless storage invites thieves." Manchuria is one-third larger than Japan, and its population is two-thirds smaller than Japan. How can they not covet this when their country is suffering from overpopulation? The immigration of Zhejiang people to Heilongjiang the year before last failed due to differences in climate and customs. Now it is best to use a promotion method, such as moving Shandong people to Guanwai, moving Jiangbei people to Shandong, moving Jiangnan people and Zhejiang people to Jiangbei, and moving Minyue people to Jiangzhe. In the northwest, move Shaanxi and Gansu people to Xinjiang and Ningxia, and move Henan people to Shaanxi and Gansu, move Sichuan people to Kangzang, and move Huguang people to Sichuan. If handled properly, it is an important strategy for solving the problem of people's livelihood. If the three eastern provinces are enriched with Shandong people who are good at farming and business, and then the construction business is started with the strength of the whole country, then their aggressive plans, no matter how sophisticated and cunning, will be useless. At that time, if there are problems that are not easy to solve, we can use the Pan-Asianism principle to help them with friendship. The meeting adjourned at ten o'clock after the report.</p>
<p>▲ National Government: At 10:00 AM on the same morning, the National Government held a memorial week for the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen. Attendees included Yu Youren, Zhu Peide, Wang Boqun, Ma Fuxiang, Li Shuhua, Zhu Luhe, Lin Xiang, Ru Yuli, Chen Bulei, Chen Yi, Chen Shaokuan, Zhang Wohua, Wu Siyu, and over 300 staff from the National Government's civil affairs, military affairs, and accounting departments. Yu Youren chaired the meeting. After the salutations, Yu reported on the issue of suppressing communist bandits, roughly stating that he had recently received good news from the front that the anti-communist army had defeated the main force of the communist bandits, and their lairs had also been destroyed. The number of weapons seized was nearly 40,000. Although there is still a part of the communist bandits who are fleeing, the central army is blocking them from all sides, and it is expected that the communist bandits in Jiangxi can be completely resolved within a month. The reason for this victory in suppressing the communists is due to the efforts of all the soldiers and the help of the people. But the biggest reasons are: (1) The people hope that political construction and economic construction will be implemented one by one. The reason why they have not been implemented is because the communist bandits are a problem, so suppressing the communists is what the people most eagerly hope for. (2) The communist bandits burn and kill everywhere, digging their own graves. Our Three Principles of the People have deeply penetrated the hearts of the people. No matter how rampant heresy is, it cannot shake the hearts of the people. Therefore, wherever the central army goes, it has not failed. (3) The communist bandits propagate everywhere, saying how the people help the communist bandits. In fact, the people hate the communist bandits to the extreme. The reason why the communist bandits say this is to shake the hearts of the people. (4) This anti-communist work is extremely well-arranged. Whenever a place is recovered, all the party affairs and politics in that place can be handled with swift methods. (5) After the National Assembly, the Provisional Constitution was promulgated, and after the Fifth Plenary Session, the government was reorganized, completing the foundation of the party and government, which is unusually solid. Appropriate measures have been taken for party and government construction, so that rumor-mongers have no way to spread rumors, and those who slander the central government have no way to use their skills. With these several major reasons, the suppression of the communists has been victorious and can be completely resolved in the short term. However, after the victory in suppressing the communists, the people's hopes are very high, and international commentary is even stricter. This is what government colleagues should pay attention to. It is necessary to satisfy the people's hopes one by one, and also gain international sympathy, in order to seek China's freedom and equality in the international arena. Therefore, our future efforts are to satisfy the people's hopes. As for what the people hope for, it is nothing more than stability of life and the protection of property rights. However, these points cannot be achieved without true unification and peace in the country. When we read the chapter on people's livelihood in the Provisional Constitution, we should know that it is not easy to achieve. This is what government colleagues and the people should devote 120% of their efforts and the spirit of suppressing the communists to after the war, in order to have some success. Regarding the international aspect, Germany, after the European War, was oppressed too much by the Allied countries, and crises were everywhere. Recently, various countries, in view of the crisis in the Rhineland region of Germany, believe that in the current situation, it will either become communist or fascist. Therefore, various countries are making efforts to provide relief, so that Germany can overcome the crisis and maintain world peace. China's current situation is extremely unstable, and imperialists are deliberately creating trouble in China, creating opportunities for communist bandits, thinking that China's chaos is their benefit. But they do not know that the praying mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind. If the communist disaster spreads in China, the suffering of the imperialists will be even worse than that of China. It is deeply hoped that various countries will understand everything and give China sympathy. Now China is facing frequent internal and external troubles. The anti-communist military operations in Jiangxi have not ceased, and the tragic anti-Chinese massacre in Korea's Wanbaoshan is repeated. Everyone is heartbroken and demands that the government deal with it firmly. However, there are still unawakened military personnel in the country who plan to take advantage of the situation for their own benefit. It is said that there are white imperialists as the background, or that they are in contact with the Communist Party. Now that the communist bandits in Jiangxi are about to be wiped out, they have to rise up and support them. But in any case, there are many soldiers and officers in the north who understand the righteousness, and they will never be shaken by one or two who do not understand the righteousness. The current government has made all preparations for military affairs and will never relax the anti-communist military operations in Jiangxi because of the riots of one or two idle military personnel. These people, during the period of the large-scale anti-communist operations, rise up to disturb the people and help the communist bandits, which is not only harmful to the people, but also harmful to the country, and even more a crime against the international community. It is hoped that government colleagues will make up their minds to eliminate the traitors who aid communist bandits and disturb the local area, to remove the scourge of China for all ages, and to prevent the communist bandits who disrupt China and international peace from existing.</p>
<h3>Severe Anti-Chinese Sentiment Among Koreans in Niigata Prefecture, Japan</h3>
<p>▲ Over Ten Houses of Overseas Chinese Destroyed</p>
<p>▲ Thirteen Overseas Chinese Injured, One Abducted</p>
<p>Osaka Correspondence: Since the tragic massacre of overseas Chinese in Korea, it has gradually spread to the Japanese mainland. Incidents of Koreans attacking overseas Chinese, destroying their houses, and beating them have been reported in Osaka, Kobe, Kanazawa, Shizuoka, Toyama, and other places. Because the Japanese authorities do not seriously crack down on them, the anti-Chinese situation is becoming more widespread. On the 16th of this month, Korean laborers in Niigata Prefecture, Japan, suddenly gathered in large numbers, forming groups of hundreds, and attacked the overseas Chinese residing in the prefecture. More than ten houses of overseas Chinese near Naoe Town were destroyed, thirteen overseas Chinese were seriously injured, and Lin Zhengpu, an overseas Chinese, was abducted by the Koreans. The local Chinese association immediately telegraphed the embassy in Tokyo, requesting assistance in protecting them. The embassy, ​​due to its limited authority, was unable to do anything, so it telegraphed the Niigata Prefecture authorities, requesting them to take measures to crack down on the Koreans' atrocities and to effectively protect the lives and property of the overseas Chinese. Currently, most of the overseas Chinese in the area have taken refuge in nearby police stations. The Korean culprits arrested include Kim Cheong-fang and Yamamoto Kintaro. Furthermore, the Japanese side is not responsible for the medical expenses of the injured overseas Chinese and the losses from the destroyed houses. Negotiations between the consul and the Japanese authorities have also been ineffective. Therefore, the overseas Chinese all hope that our country's diplomatic authorities will also quickly lodge a serious protest against the anti-Chinese incidents by Koreans in the Japanese mainland, and demand compensation for the losses of the overseas Chinese.

<h3>Representatives of the Pyongyang Chinese Chamber of Commerce Appeal on Behalf of the Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>▲ Demand That the National Government Negotiate Five Items</p>
<p>To the National Government, the Central Party Headquarters, the Provincial Governments, the Provincial Party Headquarters, Overseas Compatriots, Newspapers, Societies, and Fellow Citizens: On the evening of the 5th of this month, Koreans suddenly launched a large-scale riot, forming teams and slaughtering overseas Chinese from house to house. Japanese police followed the rioters, without carrying weapons, in a state of secretly directing them. The intention is self-evident. The next day, the ferocity was even more intense. Goods were looted, and houses were completely demolished. Iron cabinets were placed on the streets and crushed with machines to take away the money. The ferocity soared to the sky, and the Japanese police saw it all, without any prevention. Approximately five hundred people died, and countless more were injured. Blood and flesh flew everywhere, and corpses piled up like mountains. Afterwards, the corpses were thrown into the Datong River or cremated. After two days, the Chinese were accommodated in a despicable place, which was like being under house arrest. It is estimated that there are more than 6,300 overseas Chinese near Pyongyang, who are lodging in the open air, with heavy rain pouring down. They cannot return, and they have nowhere to hide. Heads are broken and bleeding, and the sound of crying is endless. It's tragic! From the 12th to the 13th, they were gradually sent back to Luda via Zhennampo, without letting a single person return to Andong. This time, the property of our overseas Chinese merchants and households in Pyongyang and Hanchuan was completely destroyed and nothing was left. Several overseas Chinese compatriots in Hanchuan were also killed and injured. Our association secretly sent a person to escape to Andong alone today. We have already telegraphed our National Government to quickly send personnel to conduct a detailed investigation and serious negotiations. The conditions raised are as follows: (1) Compensation for losses, with a consolation payment of more than 5,000 yuan for each dead person. The rest of the losses, such as goods, etc., will be compensated in full after our government, together with the consuls of various countries, conducts a thorough investigation. (2) If the Japanese side does not provide a reliable guarantee, our country will send warships to be permanently stationed in the western Korean area. (3) Punish the instigators of the incident. (4) The Japanese must guarantee that such a tragedy will never happen again in the future. (5) If the negotiations are not satisfactory, immediately telegraph the whole country to sever economic relations with Japan. Overseas Chinese will return to their country in unison. Our association respectfully pleads for the lives of more than 6,000 overseas Chinese compatriots. It is urgent and we await orders. We hereby issue this special notice, and we earnestly request your association to publicize this vigorously for the sake of rescuing overseas Chinese compatriots and to act as a backing for the National Government, so that the negotiations will not fail and the remaining overseas Chinese will be able to celebrate their rebirth. Then the country will be fortunate, and the overseas Chinese will be fortunate. Please be informed. The Pyongyang Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Korea cries out, July 15th.</p>
<h3>Rampant Resurgence of Local Bandits in Jiaodong</h3>
<p>▲ Qingdao Municipal Government Plans Defensive Measures</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: The bandits in various counties of Jiaodong were previously suppressed by the 25th and 58th Brigade Commanders Zhan Shutang, who sent troops to crack down on them. The bandit forces had temporarily subsided. Recently, due to the rising green screen, the bandit atmosphere has revived. The bandit gang in Xiaozhushan, Jiaoxian County, on the day after Commander Zhan returned to Wei, surrounded and attacked Xuejia Ridge Village for two days and nights due to unsuccessful extortion. They broke into the village, shooting and killing more than a hundred men, women, old and young. The entire village was reduced to ashes, and more than 600 houses were burned. In one family, not a single person survived, which was as cruel as the communist bandits. Recently, they have also sent people out to extort donations and, in order to replenish their strength, have set a deadline for handing over civilian self-defense firearms. More than a dozen guns from the Wanggezhuang militia were surrounded by bandits yesterday and all the guns were confiscated. Therefore, the bandits' power has recently increased. Furthermore, the local bandits in Zhucheng and Jiaoxian communicate with each other and are also very rampant. On the 13th of this month, forty bandits suddenly came to Xujiazhuang, fifteen miles south of the city, and kidnapped four students and one teacher from the village private school. Their whereabouts are still unknown. The authorities of Jiaoxian and Zhucheng counties have reported the bandit information to the provincial government and requested troops to suppress them. Furthermore, bandit alarms also frequently occur in the Haixi area of ​​this city due to its proximity to Xiaozhushan in Jiaoxian County. Villages such as Hao Cliff Village, Xindao Village, Liujia Island, Dongjiahe, Fenghuangshan, Tabutou, Hongshiya, and Xuejiadao have suffered repeatedly. At the beginning of this month, the Navy Headquarters sent warships and the Public Security Bureau Security Team to suppress them together. However, the bandits had already fled when they arrived. Each village had been looted by the bandits. The troops would leave when the bandits came, and the bandits would come when the troops left. The government troops could do nothing. The municipal government authorities are deeply afraid that this stalemate will continue and disturb the public security in the city. They have ordered the Public Security Bureau to plan preventive measures. The Public Security Bureau has decided to build a barracks in a suitable location in the Haixi area and station a company of the Security Team there permanently to deter them. (July 18th)</p>
<h3>After the Communist Bandits Fled to Western Fujian</h3>
<p>▲ Central Army Units Entering Fujian Make Rapid Progress</p>
<p>▲ Provincial Government Decides to Establish Relief Society for Communist Disaster Areas</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The Central Army units entering Fujian to pursue the bandits have made rapid progress in recent days. Currently, Sun's division has advanced from Shaowu to Jiangle, Mao's division has also advanced from Jianning to Ninghua, and Liu and Lu's two divisions in Shunchang and Shaxian have also dispatched troops to attack on both sides. The communist bandits' pseudo-First Army Group, led by Zhu De, and the pseudo-Third Army Group, led by Peng Dehuai, totaling more than 20,000 people, have withdrawn from Jiangle and Ninghua and fled to Changting and Liancheng in western Fujian. According to reports, the bandits plan to retreat to Ruijin, Shicheng, and Ningdu in Jiangxi, and defend Changting, Liancheng, and Shanghang on the Fujian border for a final struggle. Currently, the anti-bandit troops of the two provinces are taking a large encirclement formation to completely wipe them out. The northern Fujian area has gradually become peaceful. However, after this great catastrophe, the counties of Chong'an, Guangze, Shaowu, Jiangle, Jianning, and Taining are in ruins, the people are displaced, and they are gathering in Jianyang, Jian'ou, Shunchang, and Yanping. They have sent representatives to the province to request relief from the provincial government. The provincial government held a special committee meeting on the afternoon of the 16th and decided to establish the Fujian Communist Disaster Area Relief Society, appointing Chen Peikun, Zheng Baojing, and Cheng Shikui as standing committee members. They first raised 6,000 yuan and sent personnel to Yan and Jian to handle urgent relief. Secondly, they organized a relief donation team for the communist disaster and conducted fundraising by region. The Fuzhou team is headed by Chairman Yang Shuzhuang as the chief commander, with thirty-two teams under it, headed by members of the provincial government, the provincial party headquarters, officials from the national tax authorities, military and police agencies, and major merchants. The Xiamen team is headed by Commander Lin Guogeng as the chief commander, with twenty teams under it. The Zhangzhou team is headed by Division Commander Zhang Zhen as the chief commander, with ten teams under it. The Shayong team is headed by Division Commander Lu Xingbang as the chief commander, with ten teams under it. The Quanzhou team is headed by Brigade Commander Chen Guohui as the chief commander, with ten teams under it. The Funing team is headed by Brigade Commander Jin Zhenzhong as the chief commander, with ten teams under it. The Xinghua team is headed by Commander He Xianzhu as the chief commander, with five teams under it. The chief commanders will appoint the team leaders themselves. The minimum donation amount for each team is 300 yuan. In addition, they will telegraph hometown associations in various ports to solicit donations and sponsorships. They can start the process within days. (July 17th)</p>
<h3>Reorganization Storm in the Fujian Rejuvenation Motor Vehicle Company</h3>
<p>▲ Japanese Attempt to Seize Fuzhou's Transportation Rights</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: In this reorganization of the Fuxing Public Bus Company, a certain Mr. Bai was appointed as the manager. Twenty buses were added to the Ximending to Taifan route, and new routes were opened from Yangtoujingmakou to Shangxia Kangpingli Bridge and Shuibumen, and from Nan Park to Taijiang Fan. However, when the company convened an employee meeting the other day, the new shareholders actually led more than twenty Taiwanese people to take over. On the 15th night, in the name of the board of directors, seventeen workers were laid off. All the company's employees were extremely angry and immediately convened an emergency meeting of the First Branch members, requesting that representatives be sent to the board of directors immediately to discuss the restoration of the laid-off workers and give a reply within two hours. It is heard that ten people have been approved to be reinstated. The Japanese stock incident is still pending investigation. The association's secretary, Chen Gongliang, and director, Zou Duan, were publicly elected as representatives to negotiate. Chairman Huang Zhanhong was out and could not be seen, so they left. All the workers were very angry when they heard the news. The association then proposed nine motions that were passed. In addition to appointing representatives to report to various party and government agencies, they also submitted reports to the province and the National Government's competent authorities, and telegraphed all public organizations and newspapers across the country to expose the Japanese and the treacherous merchants' conspiracy to monopolize Fuzhou's transportation.

<h3>Negotiations on Japanese Fishing in Shantou</h3>
<p>▲ Over One Thousand Catties Intercepted by Customs, Fishing Boats Detained</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Chaoshan has been affected by military affairs for many years. Chinese shipping companies' steamers have either been hired to carry soldiers and transport grain, or have been attacked and extorted by bandits, or have been forced to stop operating due to the inability to pay the shipping bureau's seasonal fees. The shipping situation has declined rapidly. Japanese Taiwanese electric boats have seized the opportunity to encroach on the inland river shipping industry. It is estimated that there are more than 30 Japanese small steamers and more than 10 Taiwanese small electric boats operating from Shantou to Zhao'an in Fujian and the coastal areas of Shanwei and Hailufeng, such as Jianxing, Wansheng, Wang'an, Anshun, Anqing, Qiteng, and Feipeng. The Japanese flag is often flown overseas in Shantou. As a result, Japanese fishing boats also often take the opportunity to mingle among them, such as the Gongxing Maru, Dongcheng Maru, and Baorong Maru, dozens of which often line up to fish in the Nanao Chaohu area and transport them to Shantou and Hong Kong for sale. Shantou fishermen have repeatedly appealed to the Construction Department to prohibit it. The Construction Department has ordered the Chaozhou Customs and the Maritime Administration Bureau to strictly investigate and deal with it. On the 6th, the Japanese fishing boat Gongxing Maru caught more than 1,000 catties of fresh fish outside Mayu in Shantou and transported it to Shantou for sale. It was discovered by the customs patrol boat, and the boat and fish were immediately detained. It is heard that the fish caught by the fishing boat the other day were transported to Shantou by sailing ships. On that day, due to the hot weather, the Maru was eager to send the fresh fish to the market, which led to its detention. Negotiations have already been initiated. (July 10th)</p>

<h3>Soviet Union Establishes a Commercial Office in Liaoning</h3>
<p>▲ Consul General Ci Speaks to Reporters</p>
<p>Shenyang Dispatch: The Soviet Union, in its business operations in the Northeast, aims for direct trade with Chinese merchants. It has already established the Soviet People's Foreign Trade Committee Representative Office in Harbin to handle commercial affairs in northern Manchuria. Recently, it also established a Soviet Commercial Office in Shenyang to handle commercial affairs in southern Manchuria, located in Maluwan, a commercial area. The manager is Zha Hareiji. The office has already started operations, contacting major Chinese commercial firms in Liaoning Province to discuss representation matters. Because the establishment of this commercial office within the Northeast involves trade issues, and the current state of Sino-Soviet talks seems impossible to ignore, this reporter visited the Soviet Consulate General in Liaoning to interview Consul General Ci Namin Siqi, who agreed to meet. The interview was translated by Secretary An Geliefu, and the following questions and answers were exchanged: (Question) I recently read foreign reports about the prohibition of buying and selling your country's goods in Liaoning, Harbin, and various parts of the Northeast. Is this true? (Answer) Currently, our country does not have much trade in China and the northeastern provinces. Everyone knows that our country's largest commercial transactions are with Germany, the United States, Italy, France, England, Turkey, Persia, and other countries. However, our country's commercial companies are also paying attention to trade with your country, because our country buys the most tea, furs, cotton, and other items from your country. The goods that our country sells to your country are only a portion of industrial and commercial products, such as kerosene and cloth. Regarding the prohibition of buying and selling Soviet goods in the Northeast, it has never happened before, and it certainly cannot happen now. (Question) Why can't there be a prohibition on trade with your country? The Sino-Soviet treaty of commerce has not yet been signed. Before a treaty is signed, naturally, there can be no trade. (Answer) The Sino-Soviet treaty of commerce has indeed not been signed, but the 1924 Beijing Agreement and the Fengtian-Soviet Agreement have mutually recognized the right to trade. The responsibility of the current Moscow Sino-Soviet Conference is to stipulate detailed methods for Sino-Soviet trade. If Soviet trade is prohibited now, it would be tantamount to rescinding the rights stipulated in our country's treaty with your country. (Question) According to your Consul General's opinion, the Chinese side cannot independently order the prohibition of your country's buying and selling and the establishment of companies in the Northeast? (Answer) This is not entirely true. Our country does not yet have a complete treaty of commerce with your country, because all of our country's previous old rights have been returned to China. The current commercial companies of our country must comply with your country's laws, regulations, and customs. If there are violations, such as buying and selling prohibited items or evading taxes, then the company bears a significant responsibility, and your country can certainly completely prohibit its business. (Question) How is your country's commercial office in Liaoning equipped, and what is its business policy? (Answer) This is very simple, because the office itself does not want to do business, but only wants to enter into contracts with reputable merchants in your country to buy goods on their behalf. Only a public affairs room, a goods display area, and a place for brokers to discuss business are sufficient. (Question) What are your country's goods prices and quality like? Is there any meaning to competitive sales? (Answer) The meaning of competitive sales is to transport many goods to foreign markets at a lower price than in the country, or even lower than the international average price. Selling goods in China is exceptionally cheaper than in other countries. This is competitive selling, used to disrupt the market, drive out other companies, and preserve one's own power. This is an act of attempted manipulation, but our country's commercial companies have a shallow history internationally and do not have many goods to transport abroad for competitive sales. Therefore, the term "competitive sales" should be removed from our country's trade, especially in China. In fact, there is no room for competitive sales, and our country does not directly sell goods in China, but entrusts Chinese merchants to sell them on our behalf, who will naturally sell at a profitable and appropriate price. According to my thinking, our country's companies and your country's merchants absolutely cannot voluntarily suffer losses. Since there is no power to manipulate the market, why sacrifice blood money in vain? (Question) How will your Consul eliminate the obstacles that arise during your country's trade? (Answer) There are no major obstacles. I said just now that the prohibition of selling Soviet goods cannot be implemented. Recently, no one has expressed a desire to destroy the Sino-Soviet Agreement, the Fengtian-Soviet Agreement, or the Boli Agreement. If our country's commercial companies have improper behavior, the scope of trade should be regulated. Our country's merchants do not demand special treatment, nor do they want to be treated particularly harshly. What is required is the right to equal status in accordance with the treaties established by both countries and the laws promulgated by China. (Question) I see that there is a case on the agenda of the Sino-Soviet Conference to establish a commercial treaty between the two parties. What is the situation of the conference? (Answer) The Sino-Soviet Conference is still continuing. Under the guidance of the talented and capable plenipotentiary Mo from your country, and with the substantial expressions that your country already has, naturally, a successful goal can be achieved. Currently, your country has other issues, so the conference has not been able to proceed actively. According to the news announced by your country, plenipotentiary Mo is working extremely hard to fulfill his mission completely, even in the sweltering summer, without rest, and plans to propose a detailed conference outline. The future can be optimistic. (July 14)</p>

<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>The County Government Approves the Acceptance of the Party Committee's Accusation Case: Shi Minyong, the current supervisory committee member of the local county party headquarters, is accused in the Haiyu Daily of extorting Liu Bingshu of Shazhou City during the mediation of the San'gan River affair in 1928, and the correspondence is presented as evidence.

<p>The Electric Light Company Will Voluntarily Reduce Prices: In order to increase power generation, the local electric plant specially ordered a diesel engine from abroad, which is currently being installed. As a result, the lights in half the city will be temporarily turned off for three weeks. However, electric light users and the company had previously signed an agreement last year, stating that the company would automatically reduce prices after the diesel engine was installed. According to the manager of the company, representatives elected by the users signed an agreement last year, but recently the price of diesel has soared, from 50 yuan per can to 90 yuan. However, in order to maintain credibility, the company decided to submit a proposal to the board of directors after the new engine is installed to voluntarily reduce prices, which will not exceed the Ministry of Communications' regulation of 25 cents.</p>
<p>The Battalion Requests Additional Garrison Troops, Temporarily Postponing Arrival in Changshu: The Second Battalion of the Changshu Provincial Security Force, originally stationed in Hupu by the Third Company and Sixth Company, the Fourth Company stationed in Taicang Fuqiao, and the Fifth Company still in Jiangyin, under the command of the regimental headquarters. Battalion Commander Guang, due to the insufficient number of soldiers in the battalion headquarters for deployment, specially submitted a request to the regimental headquarters to transfer the entire Fifth Company to Changshu for deployment, which was approved by the regimental headquarters. However, the day before, a company stationed in Pingwang suddenly mutinied. The Suzhou Command, therefore, telegraphed the Fifth Company of the Second Battalion stationed in Cheng to suppress the mutiny and guard the town. Therefore, the transfer to Changshu cannot be implemented temporarily.</p>

<p>Public Security Detectives Capture Three Thieves: Xue Furui, captain of the Public Security Bureau's detective team, received a confidential report on the 19th stating that several thieves who had robbed a family surnamed Mou near Qingqiao Bridge in Zhoujing Lane, Jingyun City, were hiding in Zhoushanbang in the Guangqin District and near Tingzi Bridge and Xiaomu Bridge outside the East Gate. After receiving the report, Captain Xue immediately led the informant and detectives such as Shen Dehua to search and arrest the thieves. At around 9 PM, three thieves were captured. Upon interrogation, one was from Tongzhou, one from Anhui, and one from Changzhou. According to Captain Xue's confession, a document was prepared and sent to the Public Security Bureau yesterday, while detectives were still dispatched in all directions to investigate the remaining accomplices. A Female Worker at a Yarn Factory Dies in a Tragic Accident: Ge Afeng, a 15-year-old female worker at the Zhenxin Yarn Factory in Taibodun outside the West Gate of the city, was from Site Tou Wangzhuang. On the 19th, Afeng went to the factory for the night shift. At around 1 AM yesterday, Afeng suddenly bent down to pick up a piece of yarn under the machine. Unexpectedly, her hair was caught in the roller, and in an instant, half of her head was crushed off, with blood flowing freely. She died shortly after. Seeing this, the female worker in the same car immediately instructed the driver to stop the car and pulled Afeng's body out from under the car, which was a bloody mess.</p>
<p>Two Robbery and Assault Cases Occur One After Another: Chen Chuande, the newly appointed county magistrate of the city, upon his arrival, immediately vowed to rectify and apprehend thieves. Unexpectedly, the wicked thieves still disregarded the law and acted recklessly. Yesterday, news came that two major robbery and assault cases occurred in the Second and Seventh Districts. They are recorded as follows: (1) In the Second District (Jingyun City), at the home of farmer Zhang Baoguan, near Baomiao Bridge, about four li from Houyangfang Qian, at around 11 PM on the previous day, more than ten thieves suddenly arrived, each wielding pistols, flashlights, and other weapons, speaking in a Jiangbei accent. They used a large stone to break open the front door and entered. One of the thieves fired a pistol shot to show their power. Unexpectedly, the bullet hit Baoguan's second son, Liansheng, in the left abdomen, piercing through to the right abdomen, causing profuse bleeding. He fell to the ground, barely breathing. Baoguan was also tied up with ropes by the thieves, who forced him to reveal the location of the hidden silver. Subsequently, they went from room to room, overturning boxes and chests, and searching arbitrarily. At that time, the sound of gongs rose up, and the thieves, realizing that things were not going well, immediately fled with their stolen goods. After inspection, it was estimated that the stolen cash and clothes were worth about 100 yuan. Yesterday, Zhang Baoguan rushed his injured son to the city by boat and took him to Pu Ren Hospital for treatment. His life is expected to be spared. (2) In the Seventh District (Huai Shang City), at the home of villager Fang Jisheng in Jintou Shang, eight or nine thieves also broke into the house the night before, immediately seizing Li, Jisheng's concubine, and placing a Mobil oil lamp in the toilet, forcing Li to sit down naked and whipping her, causing her vagina to be scalded beyond recognition. Fang Ziyingkui was also beaten and injured by the thieves. Another three thieves entered the room to search, stealing more than 300 yuan in cash, as well as gold and silver jewelry, clothes, and other items, totaling more than 600 yuan in losses.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>The Dingtang Township Defense Corps Captures Bandits: The Dingtang Township Defense Corps in the Fifth District of Wujin County recently learned that the bandit leader Qin Ergou and others from Baizhangqiao Village had returned in succession after escaping capture by the police and defense corps. Squad leaders Mei Yaokun and Jiang Tingji immediately led defense corps members to patrol the village. As expected, they saw bandits fleeing. They quickly dispersed the team and guarded the important roads in all directions. They entered the village to search and arrested seven bandit criminals: Jiang Bingsheng, Wang Guid, Jiang Yukun, Jiang Xiqing, Qu Genrong, Jiang Quande, and Jiang Dezhao. The corps took them to the nearby police station to conduct a preliminary trial with Patrol Chief Zhang. The testimonies of each criminal were related to the township robbery case. They were escorted to the city on the 19th and transferred to the County Bandit Suppression Bureau for interrogation. Robbery and Assault at Zhuang Gongqiao: At the home of Cui Changsong in Zhuang Gongqiao, Wen Yong Township, Second District of Wujin County, many thieves suddenly arrived the night before, beating Cui's wife and searching for silver, cash, clothes, and jewelry for two hours before leaving with their stolen goods, shouting and yelling. Before leaving, they burned all the land deeds and IOUs. Afterwards, the Second Branch of the nearby Public Security Bureau sent personnel to investigate for a week and reported to the county on the 19th to request an arrest.</p>
<p>The Director of the Bureau of Construction Resigns: Zhuang, the director of the Bureau of Construction of Wujin County, submitted his resignation to the county government on the 20th. The original text roughly stated that since taking office, he had been in office for four years. Now, due to dredging rivers and building roads, he offended all parties, causing the local party affairs consolidation committee to repeatedly submit complaints to the provincial office, requesting his dismissal and investigation. If there was any corrupt behavior, it would be difficult to escape the national law. The director's ambition is to do things, not to fall out of office, and he has no intention of clinging to his position. Since he has been accused, he should wait quietly for a thorough investigation. However, after waiting for a long time, no clear order has been received, and the outside world speculates and becomes suspicious. He specially requested the county magistrate to review and approve his resignation and forward it to the Jiangsu Construction Department for approval and investigation.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>General Order to Establish a Literature Committee: The Provincial Government, upon receiving an order from the Executive Yuan, instructed all counties to establish a Literature Committee, ordering the Civil Affairs and Education Departments to comply.

Director Li has completed the case and is scheduled to return to the province today to attend tomorrow's provincial government meeting and report.</p>
<p>Torrential Rain Damages Famous Scenic Spots and Historical Sites: Zhenjiang has been experiencing continuous torrential rain recently, causing great losses to crops. Yesterday, the plank road in front of Guanyin Cliff in Jiao Mountain surfaced, and the steps in front of the cliff were broken, with a length of more than ten zhang and a width of six or seven chi. Also, the retaining wall of Elephant Mountain was damaged by falling stones. Fortunately, there was no major damage, but if repairs are not carried out as soon as possible, tourists will find it very inconvenient.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>A Tragic Live Burial Occurs in Qianjiashan: Qianjiashan, about ten li from the city in the west, has a fierce public sentiment and is accustomed to harboring bandits. Police detectives dare not intervene. At 10 AM on the 13th, Qian Sanxi's son, Yu Dahualian, and Xue Youfu went to Xue Yougui's house. One person guarded the door, and two people climbed over the wall and entered, using a rope to strangle Yougui on the bed and carrying him to a pre-dug pit. While he was still breathing, they covered him with a dustpan, trampled on his feet for a long time, and covered him with soil. At that time, the deceased's eldest son, Xiao Wenzhai (age 13), followed and saw the situation and cried loudly. Qian and others ran away. The neighborhood chief Wang Gui reported to the Situ Temple Public Security Patrol Rest Station, and Patrol Chief Dai sent police to investigate. The murderers shouted for them to be tied up. Director Chen Yueqiao dissuaded them. The next morning, the neighborhood chief reported to the Tenth Branch of the Public Security Bureau again. The murderers gathered a crowd at the bureau, falsely claiming that the deceased was colluding with bandits and had been executed by public anger, asking for the case not to be reported. It is heard that the deceased's wife, Qian, is working in Shanghai and has three children, who are now being taken care of by the deceased's father-in-law, Qian Lao Mizi. It is also heard that the deceased left behind six or seven mu of high-yielding fields and a house, which he sold to Li Zhicheng last year, with 70 yuan still owed. Recently, he urged for payment, which led to this tragedy.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>The County Government Plans to Establish a Water Patrol Team: The Nantong County Government repeatedly received orders from the Provincial Government to expedite the water patrol team. County Magistrate Zhang specially convened the district chiefs of the entire county and representatives of various agencies to discuss the method of funding and immediately began preparations. The coastal anti-piracy water special team must still be combined with Rugao, Hai'an, and Dongtai counties to form a group.</p>
<p>The Additional Collection of Land Tax to Support Bank Erosion Mitigation: Tongyi's coastal areas are carrying out bank erosion mitigation projects. The Provincial Government has agreed to allocate funds for subsidies. The local funds are currently being approved by the Provincial Government to collect an additional bank erosion mitigation tax of 3.5 cents per mu of land, estimated to be collected for five years, which can yield 200,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Investigation and Prohibition of Self-Funded District Expenses: The Department of Civil Affairs learned that the district offices in Nantong often temporarily raised funds on the spot to compensate for insufficient funds, causing many malpractices. The Department specially ordered the county government to properly allocate and control all district administrative expenses and district business expenses from the county allocation of funds and the district's inherent income, and strictly prohibit unauthorized fundraising.</p>

<p>Hui Zhi Records of Bandit News in Huai and Si: (1) Since the execution of bandit Ding Qifeng in Yugou Town, Huaiyin at the beginning of the month, Ding's followers, numbering over a hundred, have been spreading rumors that they will slaughter the entire town of Yugou to take revenge. As a result, merchants and residents of the town have been fleeing every night since the 5th of the month, with the sound of cranes and the wind causing panic every night. On the evening of the 12th, people fled in the rain, and two mothers of Ding Chengyi and Ju Qiyou, and two daughters of Liu Wanyou, accidentally fell into the water and drowned. On the 14th, over one hundred male and female representatives of the town's residents, including Wu Qiqing, came to the city to petition the county government and the 25th Route General Headquarters. General Liang has already allocated two companies of infantry from an independent brigade stationed in Yangjiazhuang to suppress the situation. (2) County Magistrate He received a report from Zhang Yaosong, the director of the Second Branch of the Matou Public Security Bureau, stating that there are two groups of bandits in the lakeside area of the Second District, Wei Yousan and Li Erxiansheng, numbering about a thousand or more, currently causing trouble in Xiaowuji, Shunheji, Chenji, and Xiaoqiao. The bandits are divided into two types: plainclothes and armed, making it difficult to distinguish between good and bad villagers. According to the report, He has telegraphed County Magistrate Wen Qinming of Siyang, and both parties will carry out a joint suppression. He has also telegraphed the provincial government to request that it consult the Anhui Provincial authorities and order the magistrates of Quyi and Sixian to cooperate in the suppression. (3) When it rained heavily on the night of the 12th in Wangyi, Linyi, and Luyi in Siyang, they were suddenly attacked and breached by two groups of bandits, Zuo Liangfeng and Huang Degui, who killed four villagers. They then attacked the Xu family in Wangzhuang, and the situation was critical. Township Chief Shan Taicui and Shan Yangqing of Shanwei Township telegraphed the Siyang garrison, and Brigade Commander Liu Guoming ordered Regiment Commander Wang Dehong to lead two platoons of soldiers to rescue them. It is now heard that the bandits have been defeated.</p>

<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Three Lives Lost for Twenty-Four Yuan: A county-owned Sandun-bound boat sailing on the Wan'an Bridge in Hangzhou struck and sank a civilian boat a few days ago in that town. A farmer named Zhu Zihe, 28 years old, fell into the lake and drowned. A local wealthy merchant, Xu Taihe, mediated, instructing the boat owner, Zhou Rongzhao, to give the deceased's father twenty-four yuan as compensation for funeral expenses. Unexpectedly, the father returned home with the money and recounted the event. His daughter-in-law, who was pregnant, was greatly grieved upon hearing the news and injured herself in a fit of despair. She also died the next day, a truly tragic event.</p>
<p>Woman Sold into Prostitution Escorted to Court: Shen Shao, the 21-year-old wife of farmer Shen Ziyan from Qingshi Bridge, Linping, ran away from home due to discord with her husband. She went to a relative's house in the upper four villages and was lured by Shen Dongfa, a barber from a nearby area. Yesterday, she was abducted to Hangzhou with the intention of being sold to Shanghai. However, her husband happened to be searching for her and spotted her on Pinghai Road. He immediately seized her and handed her over to the police station, who then transferred her to the court for detention. He also filed a criminal complaint.</p>
<p>End of Clean-Up Operations in Zhejiang Province: The Zhejiang Provincial Clean-Up Bureau was established on March 25th, with corresponding bureaus set up in various cities and counties. The positions of Director and Deputy Director were concurrently held by Provincial Chairman Zhang Nanxian and Committee Member Fang Ce, and the work was quite active.

In recent years, due to oppression by Japanese imperialists, the Chinese people have become increasingly determined. They deeply understand that to save China, education is essential. First, Deputy Commander Zhang Xueliang generously donated 5 million yuan of his private funds to be used as a foundation for improving primary and secondary school education, in order to promote education. As a result, education has flourished and made daily progress. Recently, national attention has shifted to the Northeast. No fewer than hundreds of organized tours come to Shenyang each year to investigate, demonstrating the importance placed on it. This is especially true for the Japanese.

<h3>Great Britain Upset the United States in the Davis Cup Interzone Final</h3>
<p>▲Great Britain Wins 3-2</p>
<p>丨Great Britain's Eleven-Year Wish Fulfilled丨</p>
<p>丨United States Loses After Leading Due to Failure in Three Singles Matches丨</p>
<p>▲Great Britain to Face France in Final Starting on the 24th</p>
<p>▲Paris dispatch - The United States had participated in every Davis Cup tennis competition since 1919. However, in this competition, full of hope, a bolt from the blue shattered the dreams of the American tennis world. The bad news of the American team's 2-3 defeat spread to all five continents. Today, the United States is hanging its head in sorrow, while Great Britain is triumphant. Great Britain has always regarded tennis as a national sport, but after being defeated by the United States in the final eleven years ago, its reputation declined and it was forced to submit to others. However, its ambition to rise again has never been forgotten. As heroes create opportunities, Great Britain has managed to defeat the United States 3-2 today to fulfill its long-cherished wish. However, the ultimate goal is to defeat France and win the championship. This is just a small test of its skills.</p>
<p>▲Complete Results of the Great Britain-United States Interzone Final</p>
<p>Austin (GB) (2 6 6 0 8 6 7 5) d. Wood (US)</p>
<p>Shields (US) (10 8 6 4 6 2) d. Perry (GB)</p>

<p>Perry (GB) (6 3 8 10 6 3 6 3) d. Wood (US)</p>
<p>Austin (GB) (8 6 6 3 7 5) d. Shields (US)</p>
<p>▲Sudden Turnaround in the Final Act</p>
<p>In the first two singles matches, Great Britain and the United States each won one. At that time, British opinion was that Great Britain had returned to its former golden age. The United States won the doubles match the next day, taking a 2-1 lead. As a result, the American side was preparing to sing a triumphant song to celebrate the success of its young players. The British hope did not diminish, and they still believed that hard work would lead to success. In the final act, the situation suddenly changed. Both British singles players won, gaining the right to decide the championship. From now on, Great Britain will take a step forward in the hope of defeating France and winning the Davis Cup.</p>
<p>▲Rising Rapidly, Heroes Succeed</p>
<p>Since Great Britain won the Davis Cup in 1912, it fell into the hands of the United States and France the following year, becoming something that could be hoped for but not achieved. Since the arrival of this year's representatives Austin, Perry, and Hughes, they have defeated Morocco, retired from South Africa, defeated Japan, overcome Czechoslovakia, and upset the United States, rising rapidly. The fate of their final success will be decided in the Great Britain-France final on the 24th, 25th, and 26th of this month. The coach of this year's British team is Brett, a 57-year-old tennis veteran. His war history is worth recalling. Thirty-one years ago, Brett partnered with Black to represent Great Britain in the first Davis Cup match against the United States in Boston. As a result, they were defeated by the Americans Ward and Davis. Davis is the owner of the Davis Cup that is now famous all over the world, and also the Governor-General of the Philippines. With the guidance of the experienced Pao, the three British heroes should have today's excellent results. According to tennis experts, the French players are not in a good situation this year, and Great Britain has a bright future.</p>

<h3>Six Weeks of Living Under Snow</h3>
<p>— Yang Moyi</p>
<p>On December 6th of last year, British explorer Ackley Grantaire joined the British Arctic expedition. He flew to Greenland for exploration, and after the expedition, everyone except him returned to their starting point. He was the only one who volunteered to stay there for the winter, hoping for new discoveries.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, on January 4th, the sky suddenly filled with dark clouds, and goose-feather-like snowflakes began to fall. Overnight, his door was completely blocked by snow, making it impossible to enter or exit. He then opened another hole in the roof as a door for entering and exiting. But by March 18th, this hole, which he relied on to enter, was also blocked by snow and ice. He had to open another hole, but the snow kept falling, and it became heavier every day. Snowflakes danced in the roaring northwest wind, as if millions of jade dragons were fiercely fighting. So, in less than three days (March 21st), he was completely buried under the snow.</p>
<p>His relatives and friends did not receive any news from him for a long time. In early April, they organized a rescue team to look for him, but failed. On April 20th, Huajinsi organized another team to search, but they were also very disappointed. Because when they arrived in Greenland, all they could see was a snow-white and flawless silver world, and they could not find any information about Grantaire. After searching for more than ten days, they accidentally saw two flagpoles and the tips of air pipes slightly exposed on the snow surface from the plane. So they stationed at the ice corner and shouted loudly by the air pipes. Grantaire also cheered and responded from below. On May 5th, they dug out Grantaire, who had been buried in the snow for six weeks, from the snow cave more than three meters deep. He was safe and sound, and as healthy as ever. Although he had lived like a prisoner for six weeks, they did not return from Greenland until the 11th...</p>
<p>According to Grantaire, "Since I was completely buried underground on March 21st, I didn't feel any danger.</p>
<p>I had wine to drink, cigars to smoke, and interesting novels to pass the time, so I didn't worry about anything. But when the last candle cast its last light on me, I lay in the dark all day and felt something was wrong. But what could I do? I could only resign myself... On May 5th, when I was getting impatient, I suddenly heard a sound above my head that was as noisy as a fight during a football game. I was startled by it and immediately roused all my spirits. I also heard someone shouting very clearly, 'Hey, are you okay? We have started working to rescue you.' Ah, this was really unexpected luck! To be blunt, I thought that in this desperate situation, no one could save me, and I planned to wait for death to cruelly announce my end, which would be refreshing. So when I suddenly heard that someone was coming to save me, I was immediately overjoyed and cheered uncontrollably. And I will tell you a funny thing, that from the time I was buried under the snow until I was rescued, during these very long six weeks, I never left my cigar for a moment. I always smoked madly, as if I would die immediately if I left the cigar..."</p>
<h3>Returning from the Pinghan Railway</h3>
<p>— Jiguan</p>
<p>My friend Mr. Gu has just returned from the Pinghan Railway to the Longhai Railway, covered in dust. He told me about the current situation of the Pinghan Railway. According to him, China's railways have been affected by military affairs over the years, and the Pinghan Railway has suffered the most severe losses. Now that the situation is generally stable, passenger transport has not yet returned to its original state. Travelers on this route often experience unusual hardships.</p>
<p>The railway has always relied on freight transport as its main source of income. Among the stations along the way, Zhengzhou is the most important point on the entire line. The products of the northwestern provinces mostly pass through here. In the past two years, commerce has greatly decreased, and there has been little transshipment. With insufficient freight, passenger tickets have also been reduced accordingly. The reason for this is the extraordinary increase in disaster victims, coupled with a shortage of vehicles, resulting in this phenomenon. Currently, there is one special express train departing from Beijing to Hankou every day. Because it does not stop at small stations in between and has military police checking on board, passengers are not too crowded. However, the carriages are mostly old and dilapidated, far inferior to the Jinpu Railway, let alone the Huning Railway. And the pulling power of the locomotives is insufficient, so they cannot arrive on time. As for ordinary trains or intercity trains, they are often either open wagons or suffocating cars. Passengers are packed like sardines, and lice are everywhere, no different from a prison. When there is not enough space, people also sit on the roof of the car. The scorching sun steams, and sweat pours down like rain, but they don't care. The departure time is often uncertain. There are times when the scheduled time is in the morning, but it arrives more than ten hours late. Passengers who bought tickets often argue, but there is nothing they can do. According to people in the railway bureau, military vehicles are congested along the way, and they must give way to the tracks, so there is no way to clear the traffic.</p>
<p>My friend suffered greatly on his journey from Beijing to Shijiazhuang. He said that when the carriages were crowded, he had to sit sideways in between, and even urination was not free. Women found it especially difficult and often frowned. Therefore, some women carry several empty cans when taking ordinary trains. When they feel the urge to urinate, they sneak into their pants and use them as a means of excretion. After finishing, they cover the cans and throw them out of the car. Although it is inevitable that there will be some leakage, it is still a way to deal with the emergency. Mr. Gu witnessed this and found it very strange.</p>
<h3>Record of the Fan Fair of Celebrities in Suzhou and Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Zhu </p>
<p>Mr. Liu Junran, a famous painter in Suzhou, once studied with the old painter Mr. Chen Jianan. He is skilled in painting and thoroughly studies the six principles of painting. His works of flowers, birds, insects, and fish are elegant and overflowing with beauty, making him a master in his own right. Seeing the repeated disasters in various places, he was deeply moved. Therefore, he and Mr. Chen Jianan and Mr. Zhang Junliang initiated the Fan Fair of Calligraphy and Painting by Famous Artists in Suzhou and Shanghai. The proceeds from the sale, after deducting expenses, were all used for charitable purposes. It has been open to the public for exhibition at Lejun Society in Gongxiang, Suzhou, since the 13th. Famous paintings and calligraphy are dazzling, how can it not be recorded?</p>
<p>Liu Linchuan, Yan Chunsheng, and Jiang Yian are the three elders of the painting circle in Suzhou. Their paintings all have an ancient feel. However, they are all nearing their seventies and are reluctant to use ink. However, they all have works on display at this fan fair. Liu Linchuan's landscapes are elegant and vast, deeply embodying the essence of Shigu. Yan Chunsheng's picture of Zhong Kui holding an umbrella and lantern, stumbling and wandering, vividly depicts the frustrated state of life, and he wrote a poem to record it: "Not riding a fine horse, not taking a carriage, rain dripping on clothes, sweat dripping on beard. Clouds and trees are vast, lanterns are dim, waking up at night, I fear ghosts laughing." It is especially filled with emotion. Jiang Yian's figures are leisurely and far-reaching, deeply entering the realm of Xiaolou. Mr. Chen Jianan has always presented his works in an old and vigorous style. This time, in the painting exhibition, he painted a lady, graceful in the wind, with a unique charm and beauty, which is especially refreshing. And Mr. Liu Junran's works, melons, fruits, fish, and birds, use a unique brushwork, further adding color to the exhibition. In addition, the calligraphy of Zhang Zhonglao, Li Yinquan, and Jiang Yinqiu, and the paintings of Gu Moyi, Fan Shaoyun, and Ma Wanli are also rare works. And the senior Mr. Cheng Xiaoqing also painted a Fish Joy picture in his busy schedule. So many famous works, it is truly a grand gathering in the art world. The fans in the painting exhibition are numbered according to the fan. Each ticket costs one and a half yuan, and there are first, second, and third prizes. Each prize is given four fans. The lottery will be drawn in public on the morning of the 15th. The fluttering of skirts and fans was especially lively.</p>
<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>Dear reporter, the reprint of manuscripts is permitted by law, but from a moral point of view, at least the source and the author's name should be indicated to avoid accusations of plagiarism. Now, a well-known domestic publication, such as "Guowen Zhoukan," has reprinted an article published in "Free Talk" (November 6th, 19th year, "Scraps of Political Sea") in its entirety, without changing a word. For example, the article "Cook Cao" appeared in the 25th issue of the 8th volume of the newspaper. Not only was the source not indicated, but the original signature UB was changed to "Lvyang Kanshang Sanren." This kind of behavior of plagiarizing other people's works as one's own is very immoral. Whether there is such a person as "Lvyang Kanshang Sanren" in the world is unknown, but the editor of "Guowen Zhoukan" should bear considerable responsibility. This is entirely a moral responsibility, because if it is not discovered by myself, people will suspect that I have submitted one manuscript to two places. Please publish this letter on my behalf as a statement. Brother WUB.</p>
<h3>Travels in India (64)</h3>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>On the 27th, teacher Sharma Nanada told me about Gandhi's movement, saying that Gandhi had deeply understood and applied Buddhist psychology. Gandhi had traveled to various Buddhist places and practiced the Buddhist principle of non-killing. If someone hit a snake, Gandhi would not approve of it because it was also created by God. Gandhi said that if someone insulted his wife, he would not retaliate, but only ask God to enlighten him. Although Gandhi studied in England, he did not use English knowledge, but invented Indian psychological affairs, the spirit of Mahavira's fearlessness, and unanimously refused to buy British goods. The British were starving to death. They unanimously resisted taxes, and the British were fined beyond their ability to pay, and they had no money to support their troops. The foundation of the government was shaken. According to me, Gandhi's movement is an anarchist movement. The masses rise up to resist taxes, how can the government exist? But I don't understand why the government has no legal means to deal with it. Many Indians told me that in this way, the British could kill them as they pleased without resistance, just by not paying taxes. Not handing over money is like being able to lead an ox to the water's edge but not being able to force it to drink. It is using the psychology of inertia. Students often regard Gandhi as a god, and Westerners also respect and believe in him. He has just been released from prison and is holding a large meeting to see the British Governor. It can be said that the three Su have returned to the court.</p>
<p>There are Nepalese students in Indian schools who advised me to visit their country. Nepalese people are fair-skinned and different from Indians. They said that their country has a Mongolian race, which is close to the Chinese race. Indians also said that the Nepalese race is close to the Mongolian race. They said that there are tens of thousands of Nepalese people in this city. Nepal is a purely Buddhist country. Their father is the army chief of the country, and their uncle once paid tribute to China. He is eighty years old this year and can speak Chinese. He is still learning Chinese and has been in China for two years. From Nepal to China, they did not go through India in the past, but went east through the snow-capped mountains. It took two years for a round trip and tribute was paid every three years. They said that it takes only two days to get from this place, Varanasi, to Nepal, and the place is quite cold, near the snow-capped mountains. Monk Jie Fa has visited it and said that there are many Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva statues there, which he has not seen in India.</p>
<p>The professors told me that India is now determined to revive its culture and does not stick to the old ways of the past, but imitates the great revolutions in various fields and strives to create with scientific methods, and must not be revived only in the world. They are willing to keep me here as a home to engage in the unity of all Asia. I greatly admire their arguments and feel their high regard. In short, Varanasi is the center of ancient Indian culture. People's hearts are deeply rooted in culture, even more than in Calcutta. They do not attach much importance to the importance of Calcutta in Indian culture. Generally speaking, India's knowledge and morality in philosophy, religion, and life are far richer than the money of the United States today. In the United States, selecting a lower-class capitalist can be upper-class in various countries. This is material wealth. In India, selecting a lower-class philosopher or intellectual and traveling around the world is still enough to be the king of philosophy and religion. Therefore, it is said that Buddhist wisdom is like the sea. In fact, Buddha is only one fruit of India, and the Indian people are the whole tree of wisdom.</p>

<h3>??? (27)</h3>
<p>— Xu Zhuodai</p>
<p>So the nanny went downstairs again to get a pair of bowls and chopsticks. Ziliang sat on a small stool in front of the bed and used the rice plate as a table to eat with his wife. Ziliang originally didn't want to eat porridge; but if he ate rice that was different from what his wife ate, his wife would have more to say. So he had to make do with eating it. That night, his wife ate a lot of porridge, a total of five bowls, while Ziliang only ate two bowls.</p>
<p>After eating, Ziliang thought about going to the pavilion; however, he knew that tonight, because of the white ghost issue, he might not be able to leave for half a step.</p>
<p>Porridge is ultimately made of water. After his wife ate five bowls, her stomach naturally swelled and she had to go behind the bed to go to the toilet. Ziliang took this opportunity to try to get away:</p>
<p>"It stinks! I'm going to the pavilion!"</p>
<p>"No! I'm scared alone!"</p>
<p>Ziliang couldn't move an inch and had to endure the smell. When his wife returned to bed:</p>
<p>"It's so cold and quiet, too lonely! Tell me a joke!"</p>
<p>Ziliang was extremely flustered, how could he think of any joke?</p>
<p>"Jokes need a trigger, I can't think of one right now."</p>
<p>"Then, look in the first drawer, what books are there?"</p>
<p>Ziliang searched in the drawer and found three or four books:</p>
<p>"Do you want to read them?"</p>
<p>"Tell me first, what books are they?"</p>
<p>"Arabian Nights."</p>
<p>"Oh! I'm so scared! I don't want it!"</p>
<p>"How about reading Romance of the Three Kingdoms?"</p>
<p>"Good!"</p>

<h3>Financial Gold Standard Returns to Calm</h3>
<p>▲ Market Sentiment Reveals Signs of Weakness</p>
<p>▲ No Special Changes Yesterday The gold standard situation yesterday was peaceful and slightly weak. The market fluctuated by no more than six taels. In the end, it continued to fall by three taels. There was not much trading volume in each company, but the industry's intention was to go down. The market opened low early in the morning, probably because the silver market rose the day before and because reports said that Germany's financial crisis could be calmed. Afterwards, there were some advances and retreats, but there were no special changes, and foreign exchange seemed to be loosening, making the market even more mediocre. Only at the end, due to the activities of the Jia Fang on the table, it became timid. As for the stability of the exchange rate,</p>
<p>▲ Opened Low Early in the Morning The opening price for September in the morning fell by four taels, to 743 taels. The big bars and silver prices each rose by one-eighth, and private telegrams added sixteen and three points. The second was two and a half taels. Soon, Zhifengyong, Bingxing, Fuyu, goods, etc. bought in, and the banks mutually traded British gold at 13675 to 25. Then, HSBC brokers absorbed September at 1875, so the gold price also rose by six taels, but there was a turnover of more than one tael, to 48 taels and 40 cents at 9:20. At that time, Dalian Gang and Yuanheng goods sold out, and the September and October British gold could be sold at 1875 to 25, so it depreciated by more than two taels. The British gold was announced at 46 taels, and the listed price was the same as before. Wanxing and others bought in, adding slightly more than one tael, to 47 taels and 50 cents. Not long after, Qian Changxiang, Yuancheng, Hengyu, etc. sold out, and it immediately went down by more than four taels, to 43 taels at 10:00. Then, because HSBC bought September British gold at 25, and Neixing and Yuanchun bought in, it added four taels, to 47 taels after 10:30. However, there was a turnover of one tael. Then, Tong Taichang sold off its positions, and Yuan Maoyong, Hengyu, etc. followed suit, so it fell by three taels, to 44 taels and 20 cents until 11:30. In a moment, it rose by more than one tael, to 46 taels. Retail investors bought in, and around 11:45, the Indian exchange rate was reported to be high, so it fell to four taels and two cents, and scalpers chased after it, so the market closed at five taels and a half at noon, and it went up to less than five taels. The listed price was still 792 taels and 60 cents, a reduction of 45 or 6 taels to 50 taels, and 47 or 8 taels at noon.</p>
<p>▲ Fell by Three Taels and Seven Cents The market opened at 44 taels and 50 cents in the afternoon, then at 5 taels and 80 cents, and the Indian exchange rate returned to a small one anna. Afterwards, it added slightly more than several cents, to 46 taels and 30 cents, and then retreated to 5 taels and 67 cents, but the trading volume was small, and the market was extremely flat. After 2:30, it was around 46 taels, and after 3:00, all the retail investors in the market entered, and the banks ate up the October British gold at 1325 and the US gold at 30 yuan and 75 cents, to 47 taels and 80 cents at 3:30. It was also rumored that the Indian exchange rate was again a small one anna, and after a while, it added another seven or eight cents, to 47 taels and 60 cents. Then, Yu Da, Yuanheng, Runchangxiang, etc. came to sell, and the British gold could be sold at 1875 to 25, so it was cut by two taels, and it was once 45 taels and a half at 4:00. At that time, it added another six or seven cents, and then Yu Da and Huiyuan sold off by agreement, and the situation became tired again. At 4:30, the market closed at 43 taels and 30 cents, a drop of 3 taels and 70 cents compared to the end of last week, and people were afraid of weakness, and it went back to around 41 taels and a half. Wanxing and Shunli entered, pulling up about two taels. According to the pre and post markets, the maximum was 48 taels and 40 cents, and the minimum was 42 taels and a half, a difference of 5 taels and 90 cents (according to the listed price).</p>
<p>▲ Naked Bar Opens at a Thousand Taels Goods were 3 and a half taels in the morning, 5 and a half taels at noon, 5 and a half taels in the afternoon, and 1 and a half taels at closing. The listed price was reduced by 47 or 8 taels to 45 or 6 taels, and then about 50 taels. The registered price was 44 taels to 46 taels, and the supplementary water was 44 taels to 41 taels. More than a thousand taels of spot naked bars were sold by Yingfenghongda Fenghong to Tianjin and Dalian Gang, etc., and the price was increased by 11 and a half taels according to the gold standard, but there was no change in the market situation.</p>
<p>▲ There Was Not Much Trading Volume Each company's trading volume: Zhifengyong, Cuichangyong, Tianxiang, Yuanxingyong, Wanxing, Yuantai, and Bingxing all entered. Tong Taichang, Yuan Maoyong, Yu Tai, Yuanheng, Futaiheng, and Yuancheng all exited. Dadecheng, Hengyu, Chunyuanyong, Qian Changxiang, etc. all had ups and downs. In the afternoon, Dadecheng and Yuan Maoyong exited and re-entered. Wanxing and Shunli flattened their accounts. Hengyu and Futaiheng had ups and downs from time to time. Yu Da, Yuanheng, Yuantai, and Runchangxiang all exited. Dalian Gang exited more than a thousand bars in total and bought more than a thousand and several hundred bars. Guang Gang still had ups and downs. Speculators were all in a wait-and-see attitude.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Seems to Be Loosening</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the HSBC listed foreign exchange, except for Hong Kong, which added 125, totaling 80 taels and 025, remained unchanged. Although the silver market grew the day before, it was not moved. However, British, American, and Feng exchange rates all fell. As for the silver price, there were no major changes in the domestic British, American, and Japanese exchange rates. It seemed to be loosening. It was weak from the morning, then stabilized, and stayed in the afternoon. As a result, compared to last Saturday, the British gold grew by 0625, the US gold grew by 125, and the Japanese gold decreased by 75. The gold market was slightly low, but there were no special honors or insults. The trading volume of Chinese merchants was not smooth. The British gold had a slight conclusion. HSBC and Japanese banks also paid in, with a transaction volume of about 200,000 pounds. The US gold was estimated at more than 200,000 yuan.

<h3>Yang Cent Suddenly Shows Improvement</h3>
<p>▲ Market Overview Although the Yang exchange was not very prosperous yesterday, there were some customers, with nearly a million going out, so the atmosphere in all aspects increased a lot, and the market price was added. As for the silver dismantling market situation, it remained the same as before, without any good to say.</p>
<p>▲ Cent Dismantling Price (Yang Cent) The morning market was 7 cents, 2 points, and 6 cents, and the afternoon market was 6 cents and 2 and a half mills. The result was 8 mills and 1 better than the morning market of the previous day. Each factory in Shanghai has thrown out about 30,000 dans of forward new cotton. Therefore, they are dragged in and not released in the office. As for the production situation of new cotton in various places, there is no detailed news yet, and the future of the cotton market is still lacking in certainty.</p>

<p>▲Liverpool: Spot demand was peaceful last week. Although futures trading was active, actual business was not significant. Conservative merchants seemed to be waiting for developments. Market sentiment was optimistic, but the market situation remained slight. Egyptian cotton prices fluctuated with American cotton.</p>
<h3>Grains: The Decline in Rice Prices Continues in River Markets</h3>
<p>▲Xinzha: Not many boats arrived yesterday. Retail sales of Gao Pu No. 2 were the most robust. Shops are adding to their inventory during this lean season, and price fluctuations are limited. There are few inquiries about the thick japonica rice from Changshu, Kunshan, and Yixing. Large dealers are increasing sales efforts. There were slight arrivals of early and late rice. The stock in river storage and rice mills is still high, and the situation is declining by a foot. There were slight openings for foreign "lu-jian" rice, and the price remained firm. The price of "bian-yin-yuan" to "xiao-er-di" rice remained at the original levels.</p>
<p>▲Business District: The source of goods is scarce. There are some remaining stocks in Puxi. Retail sales in urban and rural stores are sluggish, and purchasing appetite is weak. The price of thick japonica rice continued to decline slightly. There were slight arrivals and accumulation of thin rice. Demand from Ningbo remains stagnant. Sales in this street are focused on fresh and recently harvested goods, leading to firmer prices for better quality, while lower quality goods are gradually weakening. The supply of rare "lu-yang-jian" rice is stable, with no price fluctuations. "Bian-yin-yuan" rice remains in a state of fluctuation.</p>
<h3>Daily Sales of Prepared Flour Decline Sharply</h3>
<p>▲Futures Remain Relatively Stable</p>
<p>Yesterday, the quoted price for foreign wheat fell by about 0.02 yuan. The flour market sentiment was initially weak. The prices for July and August fell by nearly 0.01 yuan, while the prices for the distant months of September were between 0.005 and 0.0075 yuan. However, the prices for the subsequent months were difficult to lower due to the tight gold prices, and market sentiment gradually strengthened again. However, in practical terms, sales to Tianjin in the north have already become quiet, and daily sales have fallen below 30,000, so there may still be problems in the future. As a result, the price for this month is down 0.025 yuan from the previous week, the price for August is down 0.0075 yuan, the prices for September, October, and November are unchanged, and the price for December is up 0.0025 yuan.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market Oscillates with an Upward Trend</h3>
<p>▲Rumor that Russian Wheat Samples Have Been Sent to Shanghai</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market was supported by the persistently firm sentiment in the hinterland due to flooding in various regions. Some shorts slightly covered their positions due to the tight market situation, so the prices for all months showed a slight upward trend in the midst of oscillation. However, there were rumors in the market that samples of Russian wheat had been sent to Shanghai and were being actively offered. Whether this is true will be confirmed later. As a result, the price for this month is up 0.01 yuan from the previous week, the price for August is up 0.03 yuan, the price for September is up 0.01 yuan, the prices for October and November are up 0.02 yuan, and the price for December is unchanged. The spot wheat market is relatively stable due to active mill demand and slightly higher price quotations in the hinterland, with high-quality goods being quoted 0.02-0.03 yuan higher. A total of 3,500 packages of wheat from Kaishao, Danyang, Yangzhou, Nanjing, Caishipu Town, and Liuhe were purchased by Fuxin, Huafeng, Xinda, Xiangxin, and other companies.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Factory Transactions with the US Have Stalled</h3>
<p>Factory transactions of Shanghai white silk with the United States have been stagnant for a long time. Silk weaving factories in New York and other ports have uniformly suspended summer vacations due to unusually hot weather after the start of summer. There is a market for raw silk but no transactions. Silk telegrams were still not moving yesterday. Sales to the UK and France are also light. Yesterday, only Taihe shipped ten packages of Shanghai white factory silk to Shanghai, Xinfu shipped five packages of yellow factory silk, and Dachang shipped ten packages of white dry silk. The prices were all firm.</p>
<h3>Fifty Loads of New Summer Cocoons Have Arrived in Wuxi</h3>
<p>This year's summer silkworm crop in the various districts of Wuxi suffered damage from fertilizer and weather, resulting in a surprisingly poor harvest. The output of cocoons in various urban and rural areas is almost zero. Few cocoon firms have opened, and there is almost no cocoon market to speak of. The receipts of each firm are only about 30% of the spring cocoons. The cocoon market closed early. Fifty loads of new summer dried cocoons were shipped to Shanghai yesterday, consisting of goods from Henglin and Bashiqiao. They have now been placed in warehouses awaiting sale.</p>
<h3>Uncolored High-Grade Tea Trade Active with US</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the Shanghai tea market for foreign firms, Jinjiang Foreign Firm, which handles high-grade uncolored tea from the Pingshui and Luzhuang roads, increased its intention to purchase due to telegrams from abroad requesting more. A total of more than 4,000 boxes were sold in the city at a price of 57-58 taels, unchanged from before. Needle-brow, Show-brow, and Pearl Tea items are selling well in France and the selling prices are also firm. However, for the "Zhen-mei" item, only the cored goods had some scattered transactions. Ordinary goods from Wuyuan and Tunxi remain sluggish.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Price of Green Bamboo Shoots Has Become Cheap</h3>
<p>Since the introduction of green bamboo shoots, the supply has been abundant, and buyers have been cautious and made few purchases. Therefore, sellers had to gradually lower prices in order to accommodate buyers. Currently, high-quality "shang-shang-tu-ting" goods are selling for about 7 qian per catty, which is a low price compared to the usual market price. It is also said that the inventory at the origin is almost exhausted, and mountain traders are suffering losses and unwilling to sell cheaply, so it is expected that prices will be difficult to lower further and may even rebound.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Sales of Japanese Sugar Halted Starting Today</h3>
<p>▲Taikoo Sugar Opens Higher and is Snappy</p>
<p>Yesterday, no telegrams arrived from the sugar-producing areas. The price of Dutch 24 grade coarse granulated sugar at the guild market was quite firm, and supply was very tight, with prices quoted at 11.5 taels. However, a few sales at that price were made at the quoted price of 11 taels, 4 qian, and 2.5 fen. The market shape was very firm. Grade 20 medium granulated white sugar was 11 taels, with quieter demand. Taikoo Sugar spot goods grade B were priced at 11 taels, grade HM at 11 taels and 3 qian, and grade H at 10 taels and 6 qian. The market was snappy. The company offered 5,000 bags of grade DY August futures yesterday at a price of 4.85 yuan per day, and grade B at 5.05 yuan. In the afternoon, more than 2,000 additional bags were offered, and the price rose another 0.05 yuan. The momentum for price increases seems to be continuing. Sales of Japanese sugar have no room to move due to the boycott, so merchants are willing to cut prices to sell off their inventory, resulting in a sharp decline. Grade N sugar was 11 taels, 1 qian, and 5 fen to 0.05 yuan; Grade YT was 11 taels, 1 qian to 11 taels; Grade YR0 was 10 taels and 9 qian, with the lowest being 0.08 yuan; Grade TM was 10 taels; Grade TX was 11 taels, 3 qian to 2.5 qian; Grade YP was 11 taels, 5 qian, and 5 fen to 3.5 qian; Grade AE was 11 taels and 4 qian. The market was weak. In addition, the industry association convened a general meeting of its members and, in the name of economic severance with Japan, implemented a halt to trading in Japanese sugar on the market starting today. In addition, Zhenxiang Trading Company sold 1,000 bags of spot coarse granulated white sugar at the quoted price of 11 taels, 4 qian, and 2.5 fen. The market was quite snappy and had the potential to rise further.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Tung Oil Sales in Hongjiang Are Starting to Pick Up</h3>
<p>The current period is the season for sales of tung oil from Hongjiang. Although sales may be brisk during the spring, this is mainly due to merchants stocking up. The summer season is when it is actually put to use.</p>
<p>Recently, the weather has been unsettled, resembling the plum rain season. However, the weather is gradually getting hotter, and the sun is unyielding. Farmers, having finished planting, are enjoying both rain and sunshine. If there is nothing to do on the ridges, they can engage in painting with lacquer. Therefore, the sales of oil are gradually starting to pick up. Shanghai firms initially thought that sales might be reduced due to the poor silkworm season in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, so they were afraid to stock up too much. However, seeing that sales were still brisk, they rushed to prepare. Unfortunately, the place of origin is far in the southwest of Hunan Province, and it was initially reported that transport was blocked along the way, so merchants were unwilling to sell in advance. Zhenjiang merchants also tightened their stocks as a result. Although it has recently been confirmed that the transport to western Hunan is not completely blocked, delays are inevitable. It is uncertain whether the goods on the way can meet the demand during the summer season, so it is certain that the supply will be scarce. Letters from Zhenjiang merchants have repeatedly detailed this, but Shanghai firms initially did not believe it. Later, they began to believe it when goods did not arrive. Fortunately, they currently have a decent amount of goods on hand, which should be enough to meet the needs of various places and prevent a shortage.</p>
<h3>Metals: Tinplate Reaches Its Peak and Declines</h3>
<p>The tinplate market was booming in the previous two months due to supply exceeding demand, and selling prices were soaring. However, recently, due to the flood of incoming goods and the impact of the rainy season, factories have suspended operations, and customers are unable to take in goods due to poor market conditions, so the market has gradually weakened and standards have strongly reverted. The current price for 90-pound British goods is estimated at only 14 taels and 5 qian, American goods at 16 taels, 100-pound British goods at 15 taels and 5 qian, American goods at 17 taels, and 200-pound Company Iron at 31 taels, a sharp drop of 1-5 taels compared to the previous market. However, trading remains sluggish, and market sentiment is secretly fatigued. The future market is difficult to be optimistic about.</p>
<h3>Seven Hundred Bundles of New Lead Wire Newly Arrived</h3>
<p>There has been no progress in the trading of new lead wire recently, mainly due to weak customer sales and abundant inventory. However, more than 700 bundles of new goods arrived at the New Taikoo Warehouse yesterday, further increasing the inventory and making the market more sluggish. However, due to the boycott of goods, it is impossible for Japanese goods to come to Shanghai. If sales to the northern customers and along the Yangtze River pick up, the market situation will be very optimistic. The current prices are 13 taels and 5 qian for sizes 16-20, and 18 taels and 7 qian and 5 fen for sizes 21-25.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipality Levies Business Tax</h3>
<p>▲Regulations...Detailed Rules...Standards</p>
<p>▲Approved and Promulgated by the Central Government after Revision</p>
<p>The preparatory office for the Shanghai Municipal Business Tax has previously drafted business tax regulations, detailed rules, and tax rate tables, and invited representatives from chambers of commerce to hold meetings for discussion. After repeated research, the draft was submitted to the Finance Bureau, which then submitted it to the municipal government and forwarded it to the central government for approval.

<h3>The Central Urban Area Begins to Invite Land Acquisition</h3>
<p>▲Registration Starts Today</p>
<p>The municipal government, in order to construct the central urban area, has designated more than 7,000 acres of land between Yinhang, Yinxiang, and Jiangwan. The intention is to prevent those with large amounts of capital from manipulating land prices, thereby hindering construction. Therefore, after purchasing the designated land, a portion will be divided and sold at a price of 2,000 yuan and 2,500 yuan, which only includes the cost of road construction and equipment. It will be offered to the public for citizens to build on. In recent days, major newspapers have carried large advertisements to publicize this, and it has been decided to start registering in sequence from today. No one may compete to be first, nor may they pre-register before today. It is said that those who go to register at that time will also be able to freely visit the site.</p>
<p>It is heard that in order to facilitate transportation in the area, the municipal government has decided that, in addition to constructing various main roads, the original Xiangyin Road, Songhu Road, Qimei Road, and other cinder roads will be converted into asphalt roads. In addition to Xiangyin Road, which has already started work, the other roads are also being prepared for construction by the Bureau of Public Works, which has hired workers and purchased materials. It is also understood that within the scope of this land acquisition, the Bureau of Public Works has dispatched personnel to measure and stake out road boundaries daily, so that road construction can begin immediately after the land acquisition.</p>

<p>▲ Chamber of Commerce General Meeting: The Municipal Chamber of Commerce submitted a report to the Civil Training Committee and the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, stating, "Regarding the matter of reporting: It has been found that the Japanese have increased armed police in Wanbaoshan, forcibly occupying farmland and engaging in provocative demonstrations.

Our city has organized an Anti-Japanese Aid-the-Overseas-Chinese General Assembly by all sectors of society, and has resolved to sever economic relations with Japan. The association held its 17th Executive Committee meeting yesterday and resolved to convene a temporary general membership meeting at 2:00 PM on the 24th of this month to discuss detailed methods for boycotting Japanese goods.

All of our countrymen are righteously indignant and express deep sympathy. An emergency meeting was convened on the 20th of this month, and it was unanimously resolved that all members of our industry shall not privately import Japanese goods from July 14th onwards. If Japanese goods have been purchased before the 14th, they should be returned immediately. All existing Japanese goods must be reported in detail to this association for registration within one week. In the future, if anyone privately imports Japanese goods again, once discovered, they will be punished most severely according to the methods to be discussed in the future. This is a sincere warning, and all must abide by it. Respectfully addressed to all precious firms, Shanghai Ginseng and Bird's Nest Industry Association." (2) The Shoe Industry Guild held its 18th Executive Committee meeting on the 16th and unanimously resolved to follow the methods of the Aid-the-Overseas-Chinese Committee, to vigorously implement economic severance, boycott enemy goods, and notify fellow traders that they should not privately use Japanese goods before a satisfactory resolution is reached in the negotiations. It is hoped that all sectors of society will be of one mind and persist to the end.</p>

<h3>Korean Merchants' Transition After Incheon's Market Reopens</h3>
<p>▲ Summer Cloth Merchants Begin Loading Goods Today</p>
<p>After the anti-Chinese riots by Koreans, trade between China and Korea completely stopped. The summer cloth industry alone suffered an intangible loss of 300,000 yuan. The Shanghai Korean Association received a telegram from the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Seoul, Korea, the other day, stating, "Minister Wang has arrived in Seoul and is consulting with local consuls and chambers of commerce to investigate the situation in detail. The market is now peaceful. Please do not worry." The Incheon Overseas Chinese telegraphed to the Shanghai Summer Cloth Guild, "The market has now reopened, but business is slow." However, seven companies in the summer cloth industry, including Hengshengdong, Deyu, Longhe, Tongheyong, Jusheng, Yuantai, and Liuyuji, because the peak season for summer cloth sales is June and July, with sales of Korean summer cloth reaching as many as 15,000 pieces in July last year, but due to the Korean incident, stocks in Shanghai are piled up like mountains. Now that Incheon has reopened its market, they are taking advantage of the Mitsubishi Company's Keian Maru, which will depart for Incheon at 12:00 AM today, to load 500 pieces of summer cloth bound for Incheon, all of which are summer cloth from Jiangxi and Sichuan.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Compatriots Return to Shanghai from Korea</h3>

In addition, Zhou Chenglie, Zhou Fenglin, Zhou Guanglian, Li Zhiyan, and others who worked in Busan, all from Qingtian County, Zhejiang, fled to the Busan Consulate during the Korean massacre of overseas Chinese. They were also sent by the consulate on the Keian Maru and arrived in Shanghai yesterday. Everyone escaped with their lives, but all their belongings were completely lost. Everyone who arrived in Shanghai was in a very disheveled state and has now returned to their ancestral homes in Qingtian.</p>
<h3>Foreign Pilot Resumes Work Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ Pilotage Fee Issue to be Resolved by Arbitration Within Two Weeks</p>
<p>The 38 members of the Shanghai Foreign Merchant Pilot Association had been on strike for a week to demand revisions to the pilotage fee issue. It is now known that the Pilot Association has accepted the opinions of the pilotage authorities, and all pilotage fees were resumed at 11:00 AM yesterday. As for the issue of revising the pilotage fee, it will be submitted to arbitration and resolved within two weeks. This reporter visited the Harbour Master Green of the Customs Maritime Department and the Chairman of the Pilot Association, F.L. Philip, yesterday and both stated that pilotage work has now returned to normal.</p>
<p>▲ Customs' Letter of Notification: Green, acting Harbour Master of the Jianghai Customs, based on the decision of the pilotage authorities last Saturday, sent a letter to the Pilot Association stating, "Your letter of May 28 requesting revisions to the pilotage fee, etc., was discussed at a meeting of the pilotage authorities on July 13. At that time, the truth of this matter was not fully understood, and it was decided to postpone a decision pending a separate investigation by a special commissioner. The investigating commissioner will study the cost of living in this port and compare the pilotage fees charged by pilots in this port with those charged by pilots in other major commercial ports, and then submit his opinions to the pilotage authorities, stipulating a fair pilotage fee for Shanghai. As for how many ships each pilot should pilot each month, and how many pilots are normally required, these should also be noted in the report. I should then inform the pilotage authorities that the Inspector General of Customs is willing to have the customs accounting secretary conduct this investigation, and decide on the pilotage fee issue. The Consular Body and the Harmony Business Association have also approved this proposal. When your association held a meeting on July 14, the customs authorities notified you by telephone of this decision, stating that the investigation would take about a week, and hoping that work would be resumed during this investigation period. However, your association's letter of July 14 stated that it would not provide pilotage services for merchant ships until the conditions were accepted. This morning at 10:30 AM, the pilotage authorities held another meeting and decided that the pilots of your association should first resume work unconditionally, and wait for someone to conduct a thorough investigation of each person's situation before resolving the issue of revising the pilotage fee. Please notify the members of your association to resume work. As for the letters of introduction of each person, they will be returned. Please reply before 4:00 PM on July 20, otherwise the pilotage authorities will take measures."</p>
<p>▲ Pilots Resume Work: The Pilot Association immediately held a meeting yesterday morning to discuss and decided to accept the opinions of the pilotage authorities. A representative was then sent to the Harbour Master's Office of the Jianghai Customs to reply, and the letters of introduction were immediately retrieved at 11:00 AM, and all work was resumed. The Pilot Association then issued a statement resuming work. The pilotage strike thus came to an end.</p>

<h3>Anhui Province is Overwhelmed with Calls for Help Due to Flooding</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Relief Association previously received telegrams from Quanjiao, Bengbu, and the area along the Huai River, reporting that the floods had turned the area into a swamp. Now, urgent telegrams have also been received from Wuhe, Fuyang, Huaiyuan, Dingyuan, and other counties, all reporting floods and extremely dire situations, and needing urgent relief. Excerpts are as follows: (1) Wuhe is located in the lower reaches of the Huai River. This summer, incessant rain has raged, and the Huai River has risen more than ten feet. This month, there have been torrential rains all day long, and the dikes in all four directions have collapsed one after another. The water depth in the plains is as much as ten or twenty feet. Countless houses, people, and livestock have been washed away. At present, there is a lack of clothing, food, and shelter. Life hangs by a thread. We urgently hope for rapid relief to save those who are about to die. (2) Fuyang has suffered from drought and floods for years, with countless problems. Last autumn and this spring, the River God caused trouble. The disaster area is dozens of miles, and nine out of ten households are empty. Now, in June, there has been incessant rain for ten days, and the rivers have risen sharply. The vast water is boundless. Looking from the city, the whole area has turned into a swamp. Fields and crops have been washed away, and houses no longer exist. Among the hundreds of thousands of disaster victims, countless families have become subjects of waves and food for fish. Those who are fortunate enough to escape with their lives gather in swarms, looking emaciated and eating wild plants, exposed to dew and wind, with nowhere to settle. We respectfully beg for merciful broth and righteous grain to generously relieve the disaster victims. With disheveled hair and tied crowns, we anxiously await your aid day and night. (3) Huaiyuan is located in a low-lying area, like the bottom of a pot. This summer, there has been heavy rain for days, and mountain floods have erupted. The inside and outside of the city have all turned into a swamp. Hundreds of miles of villages, houses, fields, crops, and livestock have been washed away by the flood. Countless people have drowned. This is truly an unprecedented disaster. We mourn for the countless survivors. If we do not provide urgent relief, how can they survive? We respectfully implore you on behalf of 400,000 disaster victims. (4) In the western countryside of Dingyuan, mountain floods have erupted, and the Pei and Luo Rivers have flooded and caused disasters. Fields, houses, gardens, grain, silver, and money have all been swept away by the flood. The deaths of people and the washing away of graves and corpses have made the disaster the most severe ever seen. The cries of mourning are everywhere, and it is unbearable to hear. At present, countless houses have collapsed, and the whole town is in danger of destruction. Although it has not come to cannibalism, food is scarce. The situation is sad and difficult to describe, and starvation awaits urgent relief. It is said that the association has not only received reports from various counties in northern Anhui, but also from areas along the Yangtze River, such as Jiujiang and Jiangxi, which are also said to be suffering from waterlogging. Moreover, Guangdong is said to be experiencing major floods, and almost every province is suffering from disasters. Letters and telegrams are pouring in like snowflakes. It is truly difficult for a clever woman to cook without rice. They are extremely anxious and plan to seek assistance from all sectors.</p>

<h3>Early Departure Time for Beijing-Liaoning Train</h3>
<p>▲ No Stops at Small Stations Along the Way</p>
<p>The Traffic Department of the Jinpu Railway Bureau had previously planned to change the departure time of the Beijing-Ping-Liaoning train to connect with the Beijing-Zhabei train of the Jinghu-Hangyong Railway. It is now known that starting yesterday (the 20th), the 201st train from Ping-Liaoning to Pukou will be made to depart earlier to connect with the 2nd Beijing-Zhabei train on the Jinghu Line.

<h3>Implementation of Direct Delivery of Postal Items Between China and Czechoslovakia</h3>
<p>The Directorate General of Posts, in order to facilitate postal administration and simplify procedures for parcels sent from various ports in China to Czechoslovakia, which were previously forwarded to various parts of the country through Germany, recently established a postal service between China and Czechoslovakia with the Czechoslovakian postal authorities to handle the exchange of insured box containers. This method will be carried out by the two countries in accordance with the treaty from today. In the future, all goods imported and exported from various ports in China to Czechoslovakia will designate Shanghai and Guangzhou as the general areas for collection of items, and then the Shanghai and Guangzhou postal authorities will hand them over to French mail ships for transportation, via the Suez Canal, and then directly to Czechoslovakia. It is rumored that the Directorate General of Posts will issue an order to the post offices to handle the matter in accordance with the treaty within a few days.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Shipping Merchants Oppose Hold Tax</h3>
<p>▲ Plan to Request the Ministry of Finance to Cancel</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance ordered the Jianghai Customs to collect a tax of one copper coin per ton of cargo exported from each ship's hold, which has aroused the opposition of all Shanghai shipping merchants.虞洽卿,袁履登, and何墨林 were publicly elected to visit the Chief of Customs Robert氏 to discuss this tax.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>Discuss how this tax is contrary to the suppression of smuggling, and various ship bureaus are difficult to recognize. The tax authorities are related to orders of the Ministry, it is difficult to be responsible, and the shipping merchant should request the Ministry of Commerce. Yesterday, local Shanghai shipping merchants have drafted a statement opposing this tax, and its reasons are the following four items: (1) Although hold cargo, although the tax is not high, the procedure is very troublesome, which is enough to hinder the ship's schedule, to the customs authorities, due to the collection of this tax, and added employees, is also difficult to compensate, (2) If each ship has smuggled valuable goods, mostly loaded in the hold, those on the deck, not rough goods i.e. fresh fruit etc., do not comply with the purpose of curbing smuggling, (3) To avoid danger, shipowners have the right to throw cargo overboard in times of danger, (4) Each ship has paid tonnage tax, and the tonnage tax is the whole ship's waterline, then deck cargo should not be taxed again. If Customs thinks that cargo outside the main hold should pay a special tax, then can Customs subsidize shipping merchants in times of half-loaded or empty ships, etc. This statement can be sent to the Ministry of Finance today,</p>
<h3>Request to Negotiate with Various Countries on Free Submarine Practice</h3>
<p>▲ Transmitted to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for Review</p>

<h3>The Detective Division Appeals Regarding Liang Chengyu</h3>
<p>▲ Correcting Errors in the Original Trial Verdict</p>
<p>▲ The Trial and Debate Concluded Yesterday</p>
<p>Liang Chengyu, a Chinese detective of the No. 2 Squad of the General Investigation Department of the General Police Station, was implicated in a morphine robbery case at 439 Malalei, Chongqing Road, on April 28th of this year at 11 PM, involving valuables worth 50,000 silver dollars belonging to Li Liansheng. The Municipal Council prosecuted him in the Special District Court under Article 348 of the Criminal Code for robbery. After several interrogations by Judge Ge, Liang Chengyu was declared innocent on June 2nd. Li Liansheng was also prosecuted by the detective division for suspected kidnapping of Li Huiqing, and the investigation is currently being rescheduled. However, the detective division, dissatisfied with the acquittal of Liang Chengyu in the morphine robbery case, had Boliang Rubao Yi, an acting lawyer for the Municipal Council, list the reasons and file an appeal to the Jiangsu High Court Branch.</p>
<p>▲ Four Reasons for the Appeal. At 11 AM yesterday morning, Song Yuan, the presiding judge of the Criminal Division of the High Court Branch, along with Judges Du and Gao, convened a hearing. The defendant, Liang Chengyu, retained the services of lawyers Ye Fukang, Yuan Yang'an, and Peng Jie to represent him. The representative lawyer of the detective division, Rubao Yi, began by stating that during the initial trial, the detective division had prosecuted based on Article 348 of the Criminal Code for robbery. All evidence at the time had been presented to the fullest extent possible by the detective division, and the defendant had also presented counter-evidence to prove his activities that evening. As a result, the original trial acquitted the defendant, but after receiving the verdict, the detective division carefully examined it and found it to contain significant errors. Therefore, they requested the court to remedy these errors, which can be divided into the following four points: (1) The original verdict stated, "The defendant vehemently denied it." It is common for defendants to deny and quibble in an attempt to escape guilt. Therefore, unless they can present strong counter-evidence, their mere denial cannot be accepted. In this case, the statements of the plaintiff, Li Liansheng, and his mistress, Zhang A'si, are of utmost importance. Although questioned separately multiple times, their accounts of the robbery and the circumstances before and after were detailed and consistent. Moreover, the plaintiff was able to immediately identify the defendant as one of the robbers in a crowd at the detective division, clearly indicating that the matter was not fabricated. (2) The original verdict also stated that the testimonies of Li Liansheng and Zhang A'si differed in many aspects. For example, Li stated, "I remembered that it was Mr. Zhang who informed them because after the guns were taken, I saw him send them to the defendant's home, and my woman, Zhang A'si, followed them." Zhang stated, "A woman named Zhang said that the guns were taken from 756 Chengdu Road." Such important matters had such discrepancies. Upon investigation, although the testimonies of the two individuals differed slightly, they were essentially the same. The Chengdu Road address provided by Zhang was the defendant's home mentioned by Li. Perhaps the judge who drafted the verdict did not pay attention to the defendant's residence, which led to the perception of discrepancies. Furthermore, upon close examination of the records, the testimonies of the two individuals were mostly consistent. Although the wording may have differed slightly, it was not of great significance. However, the original trial overlooked the numerous similarities and focused on the occasional differences, and even stated that the differences were numerous when they were clearly the same. The principle of evidence law was violated during the process of gathering evidence, so the verdict was difficult to be accurate and fair. (3) The original verdict also stated that Zhang A'si initially mistakenly identified Hua Tan Shen Tianbao, No. 110, as the defendant when she first arrived at the detective division, and therefore concluded that the identification was unclear and not sufficient to be used as evidence. However, there were five or six Chinese detectives standing together in the detective division at the time, and they had all removed their badges. Therefore, Zhang A'si initially pointed to No. 110 but then realized her mistake and immediately corrected it. This is a common occurrence and naturally there is a possibility of correction. (4) The original verdict also stated that Li Liansheng's suspicion was not without reason. At the time, the defendant claimed that Li Liansheng was Fang Liansheng, also known as Xiao Liansheng, and was involved in the Li Huiqing kidnapping case. He had attempted to arrest him several times without success, which led to the suspicion of false accusation. Upon investigation, Li Liansheng did not report the case to the detective division at the time. The detective division discovered the case and conducted a thorough investigation. Li was later apprehended in the French Concession, and it was not that Li turned himself in to the detective division. The reason Li did not report the case to the detective division was that Li had concealed morphine and committed robbery, which were both illegal acts, and may have been related to the kidnapping case. He did not report it until he was arrested and could not deny it, so he revealed it. Eight nights later, his mistress was also arrested. Therefore, the original trial's view of the suspicion was inappropriate. In summary, the full text of the judgment is based on these four reasons, but the detective division believes they are inappropriate and that sufficient evidence had been presented at the time to prove that the defendant had committed a crime. Therefore, they filed an appeal.</p>
<p>▲ Liang Chengyu Continues to Deny. Judge Song then questioned the defendant, Liang Chengyu, and asked, "Li Liansheng accused you of robbing morphine. Did this happen?" Liang replied, "Li Liansheng is Fang Liansheng, also known as Xiao Liansheng, and is involved in the kidnapping case of Li Huiqing. I have twice accompanied Western Detective Hunter and Chinese Detective Chief Liu Shaokui to the Gansidong Road in the French Concession to arrest him without success. The first time was on February 13th or 14th, and the second time was about three weeks later, which can be investigated. I know nothing about the morphine robbery." Judge Song then asked his lawyer if he had investigated this point. The lawyer stated that the defendant did go to the French Concession with the Western detective to investigate on February 15th, but it was fruitless and only happened once. Judge Song then asked Liang, "Have you been to Li Liansheng's home on Chengdu Road?" Liang replied, "No." He asked, "Were you at the small inn behind the Far Eastern Hotel on the night of April 28th?" Liang replied, "No." He asked, "How was this matter discovered?" Liang replied, "At this time, I had already taken leave because I received a telegram from my hometown in Shandong that my father had passed away, so I asked the Western Detective Chief for leave until May 4th, when I was called to the detective division by the Western Detective Chief."</p>
<p>▲ Li Liansheng's Testimony. Then, according to Li Liansheng's testimony, he worked as a hardware broker, Zhang A'si was his mistress, and he also had an old mother and wife at home, now living in Pudong Yangjing, his hometown. On March 11th, a fellow apprentice named Xu Gengen said that he had morphine and wanted to temporarily store it at my place, asking me to take it together with him. So I went with Xu and Zhang and others. I was on the road, and they went into the alley. After a short while, they took out four boxes. At first, we went to a friend's place on Dagu Road, but because it was discovered, we went to He Xing Fang on Jianshui Road, then to the Racecourse, and finally moved to the upstairs guest hall at 349 Malalei, Chongqing Road. The house was temporarily rented for fifteen yuan a month. At eleven o'clock at night, I suddenly heard someone knocking on the front door, asking if Liansheng was home. Before I could answer, a group of people entered through the back door and went straight to my room. There were six people in total. The defendant, Liang Chengyu, pointed a gun at me and threatened, "Be polite. We are detectives from the detective division. Hand over the morphine, and we will give you 3,000 yuan." I agreed, and they first carried away one box of morphine. When they came back, they had a handbag and put the remaining three boxes into the handbag and carried them out. Because it was late at night, they were stopped by the concierge at the entrance of the alley, so they turned back and押me and my mistress to a small inn to monitor us. It was not until dawn that they押ed Zhang A'si and me back home and took away the remaining morphine. Zhang A'si also gave a statement, which was slightly the same as Li Liansheng's. Omitted.</p>
<p>▲ Dong Lantings Testimony. Also, according to the witness Dong Lanting, he was a friend of Liang Chengyu. On the evenings of April 27th, 28th, and 29th, from 7 PM to 9 PM, I met Liang in Sheng Ping Li in the French Concession. Because Liang's father had passed away, he received a telegram and wanted to return to his hometown, so he asked me to take care of his family. We parted before 12 o'clock, and I don't know anything else.</p>
<p>▲ A Fierce Debate. At this point, the testimonies of the witnesses were completed, and the debate began. The defendant's lawyers, Ye Fukang, Peng Jie, and Yuan Yang'an, and the detective division's lawyer, Rubao Yi, stood up one after another and debated vigorously. For a while, there was a war of words, each displaying their eloquence. The debate lasted for about an hour before it ended. Finally, Prosecutor Zheng stood up and expressed his opinion, stating that after examining the circumstances of the case, the facts were clear. The witness presented by the defendant's side could not prove with certainty what the defendant did on April 28th, and the telegram presented by the defendant was actually prepared in advance to use as an excuse when committing a crime. He requested that the court make a judgment according to the law. Judge Song reviewed the report and announced the end of the debate, scheduling the pronouncement of the verdict for the morning of the 27th. Liang Chengyu was detained and not allowed bail. By the time the hearing was over, it was already 2:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Communist Party Organ Busted on Tangshan Road</h3>
<p>▲ Confiscating Communist Bandits' Property</p>
<p>▲ A Large Quantity of Books Discovered</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Shanghai Special District Court received a letter from the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau requesting the issuance of a warrant ordering the detective division to search 221 Yuanfu Li, Tangshan Road, because it was a Communist Party organ. The Special Court immediately issued a search warrant and sent it to the Huishan Detective Division. At 7 PM the day before yesterday, Detective Liu Baoshan was ordered to go to the address, but the people in the house had already fled. Only communist books, such as "History of Social Form Development," "Joint Biographies of Engels and Marx," "Finance Capital Theory," "Government Economics," "History of Labor Movement," "Western Culture and Soviet Culture," "A Hand," "Diao Chan," "Farmer Li Sanmazi," and "Napoleon III's Coup," totaling 45 kinds, with a total of more than 20,000 copies, as well as a Jiangnan Bookstore seal, were confiscated. They were all taken to the detective division and sent to the First Criminal Division of the Special Court yesterday morning. The detective division's lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, stated that Jiangnan Bookstore had previously been sealed up by the High Court Branch for selling Communist Party books. Now, Communist Party books and the Jiangnan seal have been found at 221 Tangshan Road. According to my lawyer's speculation, these books may have been transported by Jiangnan before the seal up after hearing the news. Today, the Public Security Bureau also has a representative in court. However, my lawyer requests that the court first review the books before making a decision. The representative of the Public Security Bureau then filed a case, requesting that the books be allowed to be taken away. Judge Zhou Hanting reviewed the report and announced that the confiscated books were allowed to be taken away by the Public Security Bureau with a letter.</p>
<h3>Huang Kai Attempts Suicide in Huangpu River and is Rescued</h3>
<p>▲ A Suicide Note and a Suicide Poem</p>
<p>Huang Kai, a native of Jiaxing, 22 years old, had received considerable education. He previously served as a quartermaster sergeant in the Independent First Battalion, Second Company, of the Special Tax Police Regiment of the Ministry of Finance. Now that the regiment has been abolished, he was sent back to his hometown. However, his relatives at home, seeing that he was extremely poor and bored, all looked at him with disdain. Huang, stimulated by this, had no face to stay at home, so he took a car to Minhang. Yesterday morning, he changed to the Pinghu ferry and came to Shanghai. At about 1 PM, when it arrived at the Nanguan Bridge pier in Nanshi, just as it was about to dock, Huang suddenly had a thought of ending his life, left two suicide notes and a basket of golden melons, and jumped into the Huangpu River to commit suicide. Fortunately, he was rescued by the ferryman, who bravely made an effort, and sent to the Customs Water Police Station. After inquiring about the situation, the Chinese detectives collected more than four silver dollars for him and ordered him to find another job to make a living. The suicide note is recorded below:</p>
<p>I am a young man who is oppressed by the environment and has no possibility of struggling. However, I have also received secondary education, and I have a considerable understanding of military affairs and politics. After some time of training, I never liked to be subservient or follow the trend, especially since I grew up in a poor family. The word "friend" is not worth mentioning at all. Thinking back to the time when I used my knowledge, I once met people in society, and I worked very hard, but the result was disappointment, pain, and the word "suicide." Suicide is originally a boring action, or it can be said to be the result of a weak will, but I actually think it is the only god. Now I will travel with the world. Attached is a poem of seven quatrains: Floating in the dust for twenty-two springs, Looking back on the past years, dreams are frequent, World affairs are floating clouds, nothing but illusion, May my life return to the true with the water gods.</p>
<h3>Illicit Lovers Stab Husband to Death</h3>
<p>▲ The Murderer was Apprehended the Same Night</p>
<p>▲ Wang Hongding Confesses Without Hesitation</p>
<p>Yan Anong, 32 years old, a native of Pingyang, Zhejiang, made a living by fishing. His wife, Ms. Wu, 29 years old, had an affair with her neighbor, Wang Hongding, before she was married. After she married Yan, she never met him again. In the spring of this year, Yan led his wife to Shenjiamen outside the Wusongkou to fish. Unexpectedly, Wang Hongding was also there, making a living by net weaving. Then Yan and his wife met. He often went to Yan's house and pretended to be friends with Yan, but secretly continued his old affair with Ms. Wu. Yan knew nothing about it. Later, Yan's fishing in Shenjiamen was not profitable, so he took his family and Wang to live in Shengshan. Wang introduced Yan to borrow 50 silver dollars from the fish market as fishing capital, and the account would be settled after the fish was caught. Unexpectedly, Yan's fate was not good, and fishing was still very unprofitable, and the borrowed capital was completely exhausted. Wang repeatedly urged Yan to pay back the money, and Yan became angry and beat Wang violently. Wang had an affair with Ms. Wu and regarded Yan as a thorn in his side. After being beaten, he was very resentful, so at about 1 AM the day before yesterday, he sneaked into Yan's bedroom and stabbed Yan's abdomen with a sharp knife while Yan was sound asleep, breaking a hole and causing his intestines to bleed. Yan cried out loudly and died immediately. After Wang succeeded, he fled immediately. Ms. Wu heard the sound and came out to see her husband lying dead in a pool of blood, which was unbearable to see. Knowing that Wang had done it, she immediately reported to the 16th Team of the 4th District of the Water Police. Fortunately, the murderer Wang Hongding had not escaped far and was captured by the water police that night. He was escorted to the 4th District of the Wusong Water Police Department yesterday morning. After being interrogated by Section Chief Gong Pengzhu, who was assigned by District Chief Jiang, the murderer Wang Hongding confessed that he had an affair with Ms. Wu and that he resented being beaten for debt collection and committed the murder. Section Chief Gong reviewed the confession and ordered that he be escorted to the Chongming County Government for handling.</p>
<h3>Recent Events of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps</h3>
<p>▲ The Efficient Shield Western Team Wins</p>
<p>▲ The Chinese Team Ranks Second</p>
<p>▲ The Chinese Team is the Runner-up in the Japan Cup</p>
<p>The Efficient Silver Shield, a competition among the teams of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, is the most difficult award to win in the entire corps. Last year, the Chinese team won the shield with a score of 312.35, which was envied by all the teams. This year, the title of the shield was won by the Western team with a score of 254.07, which was only 1.62 points higher than the Chinese team's score of 252.45. The Chinese team ranked second, and the Western team ranked first. At the same time, the Western team also won the Japan Cup with a score of 246.12, which was higher than the Chinese team's score of 241.97. The course of the cup competition is extremely complicated, and it is more difficult than the above-mentioned Efficient Silver Shield. Therefore, it is not easy for the Chinese team to win the runner-up in the past two years. In addition to listing the results of all courses of the entire corps, such as shield exercises, field battles, and camping, which are all excellent, the two competition regulations must also have outstanding shooting scores and have won the title of various shooting competitions. Therefore, all 17 teams in the corps are doing their best for the above two competitions, but the result has never been that the two teams are better than the other teams.</p>

Zhao finally expressed his understanding and notified the residents the day before yesterday that he had decided to waive the increase and still collect the rent at the original amount. Therefore, the residents have a good impression of Zhao and plan to have the delegation send a letter to Zhao to express their gratitude.</p>

<h3>Yihe Wharf Busts Smuggling Opium Case</h3>
<p>▲ Six Sacks Worth More Than 4,000 Yuan</p>
<p>▲ Wang Guisheng and Others Detained for a Year and a Half</p>
<p>Liu Yongxiang, a Chinese detective from the Hongkou Detective Division, received a report from an informant that a large amount of opium was coming from the Longhe Steamer from Hankou at the Yihe Wharf on Yuanfang Road. He reported to the head detective and cooperated with detectives such as Zhang Yuting to disguise themselves as coolies at the wharf, each wearing weapons. At 3:15 AM yesterday morning, they secretly waited and watched. After a while, Wang Guisheng from Wuxi, Zhang Baozhen from Tianjin, and Jin Xiaoxizi from Qingkou arrived one after another and hired sampan boats to take six sacks of opium from the ship ashore. Just as they were about to load it somewhere, Detective Liu and others rushed forward and arrested Wang Guisheng and the other three, and took the opium together back to the detective division for detention. At about 8 o'clock, they were escorted to the Third Court of the Special Court. Li Zhishan, the detective division's lawyer, stated the case and said that the opium weighed 2,604 taels and was worth more than 8,000 yuan. The detective division is now accusing the three defendants of selling opium under Article 6 of the Anti-Smoking Law and asking for a strict investigation. Then, Detective Liu reported the circumstances of the incident and presented the opium for inspection. Wang Guisheng confessed that he did not know the source of the opium and that a friend named Xiaoliuzi came to him at the time and asked him to help transport it, promising to give him several silver dollars. He did not know where to send it or who the principal was. The others gave vague answers, and Zhang Baozhen and Jin Xiaoxizi confessed the same thing and asked for leniency. Judge Xiao Xiexun reviewed the confession and sentenced the three defendants, Wang Guisheng and others, to one year and six months of imprisonment each, and each was fined 2,000 yuan. If the fine is not fully paid after compulsory execution, the fine shall be converted into imprisonment based on the ratio of the total amount of the fine to the number of days in a year. The number of days of detention before the final judgment shall be offset against one day of imprisonment for every two days. The opium was confiscated.</p>
<h3>Fisherman Loses Arm</h3>
<p>Around 7:00 PM last night, at the intersection of the west branch of South Station Road on the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, a military train arriving at the South Station from Beijing was decoupling its locomotive, engine number 15. While passing along the tracks on the west branch, a man, appearing to be a fisherman around fifty years old, carrying a fishing net on his shoulder, attempted to cross the tracks. The locomotive arrived too quickly, and he couldn't avoid it, resulting in him being struck and having his left arm severed. He was bleeding profusely and unable to speak. The stationmaster dispatched police to rescue him, but his left arm was already severed. Subsequently, a railway police officer, Gu Hongye, along with station workers, carried him to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. It is reported that the injured fisherman is named Zhou Yushan, a 56-year-old local resident.</p>
<h3>Murdered Man Found in Huangpu River</h3>
<p>▲ Suspected Murder and Body Abandoned in the Huangpu River</p>
<p>At 9:00 AM yesterday, an unidentified male corpse was found floating on the Huangpu River surface near the Guangdong Road pier. It was retrieved by Chinese Constable No. 65 of the Customs Water Police Station and brought to the station. The corpse appeared to be about thirty years old, dressed in a blue long gown of "Liberty Cloth," a white vest with blue willow stripes, a white undershirt, and white twill trousers. He had a leather belt around his waist, a flat-top haircut, white Western socks, and black leather shoes. Both feet were bound with rope, indicating a clear case of murder. There were no belongings found near the body, presumably because the perpetrator feared leaving any traces that could lead to their capture. It is assumed that the murder was carefully planned over a long period of consideration before being carried out. The corpse is currently being held at the coroner's office by order of the police chief, transported there by the Life-Saving Bureau's patrol boat. Detective Wu Wenqing has been assigned to report to the local court this morning to have personnel examine the body for injuries, pending further investigation.</p>

If the business operator's report on the taxable standard amount is certified by the chamber of commerce or a certified public accountant (limited companies shall be certified by a certified public accountant), the investigation procedure may be waived, but if the tax collection agency has doubts, it shall still be handled in accordance with Article 13 of the Shanghai Municipality Business Tax Regulations. Article 14. Businesses jointly operated by government and merchants shall still be subject to business tax. Article 15. If there are any matters not covered in these implementing rules, the Finance Bureau may revise them at any time and report them to the municipal government for approval and record. Article 16.

<h3>Market News</h3>
<p>▲Universal Specialized Printing Company announces that the original business department is no longer sufficient for its needs, and has now moved to a five-story building at 141 Tiantong Road, North Bank of the Erbai Du Bridge, and will continue to operate as usual. If you are kind enough to patronize us, please move to the new address for consultation. Telephone number 41324.</p>
<p>▲City Inner Old North Gate Competition Company announces that our company has newly created a hunting game, a noble toy for children, with extraordinary fun and low price. Each set sells for only eight dimes (yuan). Major stores and bookstores in this city and other places are selling it.</p>
<p>▲Xiangtai Woodware Shop, across from Gezhi Public School on Guangxi Road, announces that our shop has always been known for genuine goods and fair prices. Recently, we have specially hired technicians to create art wood beds, which are exquisite, beautiful, and reasonably priced. Therefore, sales are quite broad.</p>
<p>▲Pathe Company on Renji Road announces that the films produced by our company in recent years have improved exceptionally. The recently invented four-and-a-half-minute records have achieved excellent results and are unrivaled in Shanghai. However, they have been promoted for a long time but have not yet been released. This is because we want to be cautious. The first batch will be officially released in the shortest possible time, including Mei Lanfang's "Farewell My Concubine", "The Legend of Taizhen", "Ding Shan Hunts Geese", and "Yang Guifei", Ma Lianliang's "Nanyang Pass", "Black Basin Case", "Four Scholars", "Hongyang Cave", "Imperial Stele Pavilion", "Stealing the Lineage Scroll", "Iron Lotus", and the Mei and Ma duet "Fisherman's Revenge" and "Four Lang Visits His Mother" and "Baolian Lantern" and many other pieces.</p>
<p>▲Maochang Optical Company, west of the old North Gate on Minguo Road, announces that recently, due to the hot weather and terrible sunlight, in order to protect the eyesight of people from all walks of life, we are selling various sunglasses. Once worn, even under sunlight, you will feel exceptionally clear and comfortable. They are essential items for summer. The price is low, and it is said that each pair sells for only one yuan.</p>
<p>▲Tongchang on North Shishi Road announces that our company's purpose is to promote Xia Bu (summer cloth) from various provinces. Since we held a 10% discount sale a few days ago, the sales of various goods have been very smooth, especially wholesale to other places. Although our company's selling price is lower, it is also really a result of the people's love of wearing domestic products. There are only six days left in the price reduction period, ending on the 25th. It is expected that there will be an even greater boom in these few days.</p>
