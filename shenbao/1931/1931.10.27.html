<p>國内要聞</p>
<h3>國府盼國聯繼續努力</h3>
<p>國府宣言望决議案早日實行</p>
<p>日軍藉口剿匪據四洮路各站</p>
<p>溥偉就遼寗四民維持會會長</p>
<p>國聯議案通過後</p>
<h3>國府發表宣言</h3>
<p>深望决議案早日實行</p>
<p>（南京）國民政府爲國際聯合會已通過解决中日問題之决議案、特發佈宣言、原文如次、</p>
<p>國際聯合會行政院已於二十四日决議拒絶日本之提案、崦通過該院原案、雖日本堅决反對、而其餘行政院會員如英·法德·意·愛爾蘭瓜待馬拉南斯拉夫·那威·巴拿馬·波蘭秘魯·西班牙·等十二國、一致與中國擁護有政院　决議案、於此可知中國堅持日軍即速完成撤退一節、實合國際公道與　義、而爲世界各國所確　、并予以完全贊助也、依照國聯行政院决議案、日軍應於十一月十六日前完全撤退是國聯對於任何國家憑藉武力而圖解决國際紛爭其反對之意益可　此證　、而决議案又建議、俟撤兵後、中日組織調解委員會或其他類似之永久機關　節尤足表現國聯努力促進和平之意、國民政府深望國聯行政院决議案能早日實行、并盼國際聯合會繼續努力務使目的能完全達到、吾國國民自當刻意忍耐、恪守法律、以助正義公道之成功、國民政府信日本終能尊重世界公意依　　聯决議、於十二月十六日前、　軍隊完全撤退、俾其他問題、得賡續進行、以謀恢復兩國國民間之良好友誼、而東亞永久利平之基礎、亦得賴以鞏固焉、（二十六日專電）</p>
<h3>美政府注視日軍行動</h3>
<p>必要時將取相當步驟</p>
<p>（華盛頓）國聯對於滿案未能切實解决後、今日美官塲表示失望、國務院中近來所抱樂觀態度已爲之銳减、惟美國尙未謀立即有所行動、據稱、暫時尙不欲離國聯而獨自行動、今後三星期中、滿洲日軍地位將爲大可注意事件、此問科中國當未必屈服、在日軍撤完前與日本直接談判、現國務院正份哈爾濱美總領事翰森與東　美大使署參贊薩里斯伯　滿實地視察之詳細報告、今國聯旣休會、美政府之注意、當又復集中　遠東矣、此問多謂國聯旣以道德力施於日本、第二步當看日政府　如何行動、（二十五日國民社電）</p>
<h3>道德上日本已受重創</h3>
<p>國聯尙可取進一步行動</p>
<p>白里安謂陰　或將吹散</p>
<p>（日内瓦）國聯行政會已延會至十一月十六日、但衆料如日本不依限撤兵、施肇基於商諸中政府後、或將請求提早開會、屆時中國或將請援用會章第十五條、即在會各國有權採取其認爲維護公道正義所必要之行爲是、此間人士以爲國聯辦理此項交涉、可謂已獲重要成功、因行政會已决定一種不能退讓之原理上地位，日本苟不於十一月十六日撤退佔據區域内之軍隊、則國聯將不得已而謀取强迫執行之方法也、芳澤今日起程赴巴黎、就其駐法大使原職、芳澤自稱將在巴黎與法外長白里安繼續談判、白里安現亦返巴黎、日代表團其餘人員定明日離日内瓦、施肇基將在此再留一星期、然後返倫敦、白里安接到來電頗多、賀其於討論滿洲事件時辦理國聯會務妥善、今目白里安復接到上海華人商會來電、謝其調解中日交涉之努力、並贊成行政會關於此事之議案、統觀過去　星期國聯行政會議事情形、一般輿論皆謂日已在道　上受一大創、並覺日本地位自始即無可維護、行政便最後數次會議時、辯論最烈者、爲薛西爾白里安與瑪達利迦二人、瑪氏且發驚人言論、請行政會勿忘却會章第十條尊重各會員國土地完整與政治獨立、行政會遇有侵略行爲或侵略險時、須籌議辦法、以履行此種義務之規定、行政會雖决定延會至十一月十六日、但同時授權議長於其認爲需要時得在期前召集會議、（二十五日路透社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）倫敦各報雖詳載國聯行政會集會情形、但因國内選　多事、故對於行政會之决議、除泰晤士報外、皆未著批評、泰晤士報以爲國聯辦理此事可告無罪、政會之議案、雖因日本反對而失效、但仍不失爲世界最高公斷機關愼思熟慮之公論云、（二十六日路透社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）法外長白里安今晨自日内瓦返此抵站後、即乘專車逕赴外交部與秘書長裴台洛聚談甚久、後有新聞記者以滿洲事件探詢白氏之見解、白氏稱、吾人合理之期望亦不過如此、但在目前彼尙不多　也、白氏復謂在十一月十六日以前、陰霾或尙有吹散　希望、亦屬意中事以國聯本身而論此次能安渡此嚴酷之試騐、亦屬萬幸云、白里安此種見解、頗能代表法人普通評論之一般、彼等皆重於國聯决議案道德上　壓力、而　一方面則對於國聯之無力强制執行該項决議、頗覺憂懼、再則日來此次見辱於國聯、大有老羞成怒勢、倘將來不顧一切悍　獨行、而國聯復以保留新得尊嚴起見不得不採取吏嚴厲　步驟、則前途至爲可慮也、法國報紙中其意見顯然與上述評論不同者厥惟巴黎廻聲報、該報堅執日　之態度尙未爲日内瓦所了解、　白里安氏爲保全其衷心愛護之聯盟起見恐嘗勸止國聯從事之過於操切云、此、外巴黎最報對白里安此次調解之功績、亦甚加稱頌、（二十三日國民電）</p>
<h3>日軍開赴四洮路各要站</h3>
<p>藉口剿匪護路</p>
<p>（東京）瀋陽日軍司令部派兵分赴四洮鐵路各重要車站保護鐵路、其所持之理山、爲盜匪攻擊該路車站與火車之日形活動、此舉使南滿鐵路區域外之兵額有增無减、但官塲謂此係南滿鐵路所請求者、因中國向南滿鐵路借欵築路、以四洮鐵路爲抵押品也、四洮路線長逾四日二十六哩、聞日人在此路上之借欵、共日幣三千二百萬元、日本官塲　日本不欲增兵超過條約所許額、但或須增多滿洲現有兵額、以便瓜代現方從事剿匪軍隊、現有駐兵、勞苦已甚、須有休息、但因不敷分配、現不能許其休養也、（二十六日路透社電）</p>
<h3>日浪人在黑交署尋釁</h3>
<p>越範言動顯有主使</p>
<p>（南京）外交界接北平廿五日電、稱二十四日午後一時日人商塜須本兩名、至黑龍江交涉署見王主任、云係關東軍司令官派令持函面見馬代主席、并帶有關東軍函一件、該日人等蠻横異常、聲言張海鵬部須到省、江橋亟應修復、并云本莊必貫澈限制東三省軍政長官回任之主張、馬主席　副張所委、决不使在黑存留等語、聞黑省當局與日領切實交涉、請將此來　不明舉動乖謬之日人、嚴加約束、（二十六日專電）</p>
<h3>日本怙惡不悛</h3>
<p>日政府發表聲明書</p>
<p>認國聯决議不成立</p>
<p>軍閥仍欲蠻幹到底</p>
<p>（東京）說明中日直接交涉根一原則日政府聲明書、已於二十六日下午六時白日本外務省發表、其要旨如左、</p>
<p>（一）關於日軍退至附屬地問題及中日直接交涉之理事會决議案與日本修正案、二十四日採决之結果均不成立、（二）此次之事變、係起因於中國軍憲之挑發、日本未用强制手段、以解决紛爭條件强逼中國、（一）日本政府統觀中日大局、表示凡關於日本國民的生存之　益、絶對不許改變之决心、曾各般相當機會、言明此趣旨、中國此時　値高唱恢復國權趨於極端、盛倡排日敎育、有藐視國際條約之傾向、若果依賴中國之保障、使全部日軍退回附屬地内、則勢必更使事態惡化徵諸多年以來之歷史、可爲明證（一）日本政府爲確保在滿日本人民安全計、考慮必要之基礎的大綱如左、</p>

<p>此與國聯之目的精神均相符合、爲建設極東平和之基礎之原則、深信世界之公論必贊向之、日本代表在國聯理事會不以此爲議題之故、即因爲願與中國直接交涉也、</p>
<p>（一）今日之急務、在協力收拾時局　共存共榮之目的、日本政府至今依然有關於前記問題與中國政府開始商議之意、未曾改變也、（二十六日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）今日日本對於滿案態度、仍堅持一俟在滿日僑生命財　可以認爲安全、即將軍隊撤回滿鐵區域、日政府此時則將繼續努力勸誘中國與之直接交涉、聲　倘能立即開始談判則日軍亦將迅速撤回原駐地方、日政府發言人聲稱、日本認國聯理事會結未、於彼并無不利處、至日本軍閥依然抱侵略態度、星期日特别閣議後、南陸相曾宣稱、日本對滿基本政策、不能爲國聯决議案而變更可見一斑、若首相已進宫覲見日皇陳奏最近發展及日本地位、今晚將向國會本黨民國府爲國聯决議發表宣言⊙日軍佔據四洮路各要站⊙閻馮出席和會代表首途⊙（見國内要電）美法會商世界經濟問題已有具體結果⊙（見國外要電）京粤代表昨在伍宅開談話會⊙上海各大學敎授對時局發表意見⊙（見本埠新聞）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>闢日人所謂「滿蒙特殊權益」（一）</h3>
<p>日軍此次對我東北實施暴力發動。其所宣示於世界之理由。即爲「中國危害其滿蒙特殊權益。」「威脅其在滿蒙之特殊地位。」即日代表芳澤在國聯行政會議中官稱。「滿蒙問題者。實一事實問題。而非理論問題。」至所謂「滿蒙特殊權益」與「特殊地位」之獲。得則謂基於清日日俄兩次大戰之犧牲。於滿蒙曾完「血稅。」故在經濟上與政治上應享有特殊之權益。甚且謂即不幸與世界爲敵。亦不能更改其滿蒙之地位，此種似是而非之理由與論調。頗足以矇蔽世界人士之耳目。尤足以激起日本國民之偏激情感。終無由明白事實與理論之眞相。是不可以不嚴辭痛闢。</p>
<p>夫所謂「特殊權益。」在理論上與事實上。究作如何正規之解釋。及有無。成立之理由。此爲吾人所最應首先認清。就「特殊權益」字面上之意義而解釋當無異於所謂「勢力範圍。」此種「勢力範圍。」即「特殊權益」之分割。在理論上爲違反「尊重中國主權」之原則而在事實上則亦破壞中國領土政治主權之完整。妨碍中國經濟之發展。危害中國人民應享之利益。其於世界之影響。不僅與華盛頓會議所通過之「各國工商業機會均等」之原則相衝突。而且極易惹起國際間之猜忌與衝突。時時予世界和平以威脅與迫害故所謂「特殊權益」之劃分。實爲日本帝國主義者强權勢力之向外伸張排除他國均等利益。亦即第二次世界大戰之醖釀與製造。其唯一之解釋爲「强權」爲「武力。」捨　此而外更無所謂正規之理論解釋與事實根據。</p>
<p>茲退一百步言之。日人每五論及「特殊權益。」輒引一九一七年之藍辛石井恊定爲辯護之根據。茲姑無論此項協定爲一種秘密之協商。互相承認。中國絶未預聞其事。並無遵守之義務就如該協定。中之所規定。所謂「特殊權益」據藍辛之解釋。亦僅限於「經濟上之意義。並無政治上之意義」然而揆諸事實日人今日在我東北之行爲。爲純限於經濟上之經營乎。抑超越經濟意義之外而含有絶大之政治作用乎。事實具在日人無庸辯飾。世界人士。當更不難灼見。</p>
<p>夫樹立「特殊權益」於他國領土之内。妨礙主權國應享之神聖主權。甚至予主權國以極嚴重之威脅。而猶曰「彼危害成之特殊權益。我不得不以斷然之手段。作正當之自衞。」遂不恤破壞世界和平實施暴力發動。此種行動在公理與正義之範圍以内。吾人誠不解其作何解釋有之。則爲吾人在前文所言。强權而已。暴力而已以强權暴力解釋公理與正義。與其謂爲人類道德上之缺陷母寗謂爲人類文明上不可磨滅之羞辱。</p>

<p>抗日之聲</p>
<p>— 臥佛</p>
<p>最近寗粤兩方。因見暴日侵佔東省。國勢日危。爲謀團結一致。共禦外侮計。各派代表來滬。開誠佈公。磋商統一辦法。和平有望。這委實是國難中一好現象。不過各代表在商洽條件的時期。應時時顧念東省同胞。哀號宛轉。天天在遭日人極慘酷的屠殺。殘忍的鞭策。多過一天。便多受無數重痛苦。再應顧念東省以外的人民。也刻刻在提心吊胆。寢食不寗。恐怕蹈那朝鮮印度的覆轍。各代表旣爲安内禦内而謀和平統一。就該趕速解决。早日實現。再不要千回百折。虚擲時光。須知諸君在租界内多度幾天或幾月的光陰。生活上原一點覺不到甚麽。可在那日人　蹄下的東省同胞和東省以外的人民。却要遭盡殺戮。擔盡恐慌咧。</p>

<h3>怎樣學愛迪生</h3>
<p>未來的世界是一個電化的世界；未來的中國也必定要造成一個電化的中國；這是没有疑義的。我們的近鄰日本和俄國都已經大規模的進行他們的電化全國的計畫，我們决不可因循懈怠。電化中國最需要的是電學人才。青年學生中性情相近的是應該負起責任來研究這種學術。我們眼面前最好的一位老師便是愛迪生。學愛迪生决不是讀讀愛迪生傳和他的發明報告就算完事。我們必得像他一樣在電氣實騐上親自動手去做，用腦去想，纔不愧爲他的學生。這還不夠，我們必得天天做，天天想，一年到頭，一世到老都在這上面下功夫纔能希望有成就。嘗一嘗，試一試，就放下手來，那是不會有什麽大不了的貢戲的。</p>
<p>據布賴恩Ｂryan說，他的諸多發明中，只有留聲機是偶然領悟到的，其餘都是從有計畫的苦功中得來。爲着要求得一種最有效之電燈用的金屬燈絲，他曾經用礦物做了一千六百次的試騐。他檢查過六千種的植物，爲的要看那一種植物最合乎製造炭絲之用。所發明的　鐵蓄電池是五萬次試騐之結果。</p>
<p>愛迪生有一句名言：「天才是勞動而有恒心。」他所說的勞動實有勞力與勞心兩方面。如果你要知道你在電學或任何學問上有無一些天才，只須問一問自己在這件事上是否肯動手用心去做，做得不肯歇手？</p>
<h3>記青島馬文龍</h3>
<p>— 丙丁</p>
<p>東省綠林英雄。蓋三省小白龍等。鑒於此次日人之暴行。竟一變其昔日綠林肝胆。而作爲國盡忠之志土。通電各地。願爲國民前驅。枕戈待旦。殺彼倭奴。滅此朝食其忠義之氣。溢於言表。而袞袞諸公。若熙洽張海鵬等。爲虎作倀。甘爲亡國奴隷。觀之能不愧煞。於此益信昔人草莽英雄之語。又不禁聯想及山東青島之馬文龍焉。馬爲畢莘舫部下之團長。與畢有八拜交。褚玉璞殺莘舫。恐馬之復仇。設計誆文。與畢同遇害於濟垣。馬在未任軍職時亦爲一綠林英雄。東海一帶。爲其食邑。而常居於青島。其部下都五千人。而馬則方二十二歲。善發槍。能左右執匣砲二。馳馬荒野·仰擊天際飛鳥百不失一。堪稱絶技。其妻技尤精。馬自嘆勿如。夫婦二人。率部居青時。常約其部下。不得妄刦國人。而遇倭奴。則殺無赦。時青島尙在倭奴之手。地方治安。皆由其警士維持。倭警曾誇爲世界第一。馬視之如草莽。殺人越貨之事。日有所聞。皆馬部所爲也。倭奴聞馬之名。依稀泰西之羅賓漢。其威武可以想見。曾有一次。倭警三百人。與馬部數十人。戰於大港。馬夫婦二人。槍無虚發。頃刻之間。倭警死大半。遂潰。自是不敢與馬較。後我國收還表島。倭奴意欲逞其奸計。密賄馬。令其暴動。俾能藉口。馬佯應之。及期。絶不舉事。倭奴怒甚。欲剿滅之。然畏之如虎。馬復使人言於倭官。謂若不交還我國。凡倭奴皆死無赦。倭奴大懼。於是我國得收還青島。畢至青後。知馬爲一愛國男兒。乃招安之。馬即維持青島治安。盜風顿止。倭奴愈驚馬之爲人。倭奴在青。其氣燄凶横。車夫之被擊者。不計其數。一日。有倭奴方擊一車夫。被馬見。即厲聲斥之。且力掌其頰。倭怒。方欲聚衆。馬大呼曰。予乃馬文龍也。不服者可來一較。倭聞之喪胆。鼠竄去。亦可知倭奴之懼馬矣。</p>
<h3>世界小事記</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>法人的嗜好費法蘭西人有兩種嗜好。差不多是很普遍的。就是吸煙與飲酒。每一個男子對於這兩種嗜好所納的稅。平均每年達五金鎊之多。若以全國計。爲數就可驚了。</p>
<p>英兵的橡皮鞋、世界各國兵士的待遇。以美國爲第一。英國也很不錯聴吉斯德Ｍanchester地方一個兵營中。最近頒發許多橡皮鞋。給那些値夜守望的兵士們穿着。因爲穿了普通的皮鞋槖槖作聲。往往有擾其他兵士們的睡眠。穿了橡皮鞋那麽大踏步往來時。也可寂無聲息了。匈牙利的電話記錄機匈牙利新發明一種機械。可將每一個人在電話中所說的話記錄下來。以後可以像留聲機上的唱片一般翻製出來。據說那邊的電話公司將採用這項機械以便計時取費可使收入上增加不少。一般青年男女。却不免耽心因爲彼此互通情話時。將多所不便了。</p>
<h3>伍廷芳博士軼事</h3>
<p>— 悟非</p>
<p>伍廷芳博士精研法節律。其學識道德。久爲社會人士所欽仰。日本伊藤博文。尤敬佩其人。故乘李文忠詢以中國人才之際。最爲推崇。旣而李公入奏。召爲刑部主事。蓋當清季。諸政革新。而伍博士爲習歐美法律之最早者。藉以改良刑法也。聞爲主事時。適京師有婦姑勃谿。其姑自縊一案。對於新舊刑律。頗有重大出入。其事實爲某媪懟婦之不孝。屢思逼令大歸。而又感於子婦之情好甚篤。不忍重拂子意。其子欲順母意以出婦則未免兒女情長。若逆母而不出婦。則未免闔家不和。尙未有調和安全。以期家庭和樂之法。適經商遠出。諄囑其妻善事姑嫜。勿使悲苦。婦口諮而心違。其夫出後。初尙相安。未幾偶以他事未順姑意。姑怨憤異常。入室自縊。輿論譁然。以爲婦逼姑死。是逆倫重案、罪情甚大。控之官。並緝其子歸案。案旣决。依舊刑律均處死罪。以爲不孝者戒。將請士命。由刑部主事擬稿。案經伍博士手。伍博士審議再三。以爲犯罪之目的須有意思行爲而决。婦雖不孝。姑由自縊。並非逼死。且其子外出。更不知情。依歐美刑法言之。决無處以死刑之理。况當改良刑法。而仍沿舊律判斷。將何以全部改革。與刑部尙書某力爭。而某則維護舊律。仍處凌遲。伍博士以一生一死。出入如是。旣求其生而不得。雖死者於我無怨。而刑法又不能逐步改良。以此而推及其他。是政府陽標改良之名。而陰實施行舊律。志不得逞。學不獲展。遂掛冠而去。惟李文志識其才。仍畀以事。隨時諮詢。民元。伍博士長民國法律學校。余爲門下士。親聞其講述云。</p>

<h3>雪片譚屑</h3>
<p>— 吳蒙</p>
<p>自男女合演之風作。而坤伶盛起。寢有陰盛陽衰之勢坤伶尤以青衣花旦爲多蓋以女飾女。無待矯作。以視男伶。較易見好故也。顧此第指裝樣身裁言之耳。以言唱白。則善聽歌者。仍多趨男而舍女。蓋女子之嗓音。類皆尖窄剌耳。頗似男伶之所謂鬼音者。唱縱佳。聆者每以未能過癮爲憾。此則限於天賦。有非人力所能勉强者。</p>
<p>於此中得一人焉。曰雪艶琴。娟娟此豸。是眞能奪男伶之席。而超出坤角之範圍者。雪之嗓音。寛空適中運用得宜。行腔則落落大方。無小家氣。即在男伶中。亦殊未易多得。近頃蓓開所出第六期新片。有雪之起解探母兩張。並稱佳構。起解二面。與蕭長華合。原板十句。各有精彩。「大不該將已女就賣入娼門」之南梆子腔。人人優爲之。固無論矣。「二可恨山西沈燕林」之「燕林」二字。與「他不該用藥麵毒死燕林」之「燕林」二字。腔均婉妙。而彼此截用不同。余意尤以「毒死熱林」之腔爲最新頴動聽。滿斷更續。頗有柳暗花明又一村意也。「惟有你老人家是個大大的好人」句。簡潔乾凈。無拖泥帶水之貧腔。亦視他伶爲佳。探母兩面。與譚富英合。快板中有最佳之句三。其一爲「他道是楊家將把名姓改換。「名姓兩字一頓。逼出「改」字。余覺其似别有一種韵味。可供咀嚼。爲他伶所無。其二爲「他思家想骨肉不得團圓。」「想骨肉」三字。字字有一小腔。輕清神速。祇在一刹那間。粗心者不易領會也。其三爲「有什麽心腹事你對我明言。」「有什麽」三字。每字一頓接下「心」字再一頓。然後一瀉而下。蓄勢甚足。能令聽者精神一振。長華陪起解。念白清脆流利。富英陪探母。快板韵味醇厚。均足爲艶琴綠葉之助也。</p>

<h3>敲夢的杵（二五）</h3>
<p>— 程瞻廬</p>
<p>「居士，你迷戀着現在世界，竟不想回來了！要不是，這當頭一杵，怎能敲破你的幻夢！居士，你辛苦了。」長老徐徐放下這根敲夢的杵。</p>
<p>「老和尙，現代的洪爐中，簡直可以鎔化金鐵；不經你老和尙當頭一棒，我怎能夠從洪爐中躍冶而出。一陶遲離着座說。</p>
<p>「居士，你遨遊着現在世界，作何感想？」</p>
<p>「中國的積弱原因，我都知曉了；我向過去的時代中流連，我便知道積弱的遠因；我向現在的漩濄中沈淪，我又知道積弱的近因。老和尙，你會行使年光順流法，使那轉輪椅子順着他球自轉的方向，而增加速度千萬倍；你會把地球上的人未曾遇見的世界，敎那坐在轉輪椅上的人提前相逢，而預知未來的現象；我覺得過去的中國，現在的中國，都不能滿足我的希望；　我還不如在轉輪椅上順轉一下子，瞧瞧未來世界罷。」</p>
<p>「未來世界不用瞧罷。」</p>
<p>「老和尙，你旣許我遨遊過去和現在的世界；你爲什麽又不許我目擊未來的世界？」</p>
<p>「居士，過去世界種的是現在世界的因；現在世界種的是未來世界的因；你已遊徧了現代的樂園，未來世界怎麽樣，你不難推想而知，你又何必坐上這張轉輪椅子？」</p>
<p>「那麽，不好了！現代的樂園中，種的都是亡國的因，不是種的善因；推想中的未來世界，我們只怕要做亡國奴罷！」說的時候，眼涙奪眶而出了。　　「居士不用悲傷，也許不會亡國，事在人爲。」</p>

<h3>紗花纱市受銀緊影響</h3>
<p>紗市平靜、毫無榮辱可分、但實銷受銀根之影響各帮均無興奮意味因之生意益覺岑寂、然市上現紗底貨缺乏、以日紗不能通行、本紗不敷供給、故交易雖清、市盤尙能維持云、</p>
<p>人標續堅人標前市開盤、以美棉平疲、塲中交易平平、但新賣户較缺、各月微漲五·六·七錢全日成交統計一萬九千包、查賣出明德六百三十包、益昶八百五十包、義餘八百五十包、永昌六百五十包、買進公泰一千二百包賡豐九百五十包、信誠一千包、長豐六百五十包、茲將人標收盤價錄左、</p>

<h3>棉市步堅之由來</h3>
<p>金市又穩：買方强拉</p>
<p>棉市甚堅、蓋以美棉趨勢尙佳、而金價又穩靜、於是買方拉力尤强、目本月份有一部份廠商預備收現之說、日前視外棉良好、將空額收回、無意交解、市氣由此驟緊、而反動愈烈、多數目光須看四兩、然本花生意寥若晨星、各廠絶少進意、由新印棉又購一萬七千件、前途仍視美棉爲進退也云、</p>
<p>近期漢標獨漲九錢漢標前市開盤、以美棉大漲小跌場中市氣仍佳、賣户不多、各月漲一二錢、全日成交統計十二萬一千二百担查賣出吉豐四千四百担、恒德三千八百擔、大孚二千三百担、義成二千一百担、源大四千一百担、長豐三千五百担、新亨二千九百担、買進泰興五千五百担、利昌五千担、愼昌三千四百担、長豐三千五百担、裕大三千八百担、賡豐二千八百担、信誠一千五百担、瑞大一千五百担、茲將漢標收盤價錄左、</p>

<h3>英印棉業週訊</h3>
<p>孟買上週美印間之棉價雖有進步、然爲羅比與英幣間之關係所推翻、因之棉價仍在出口旺盛線以上約百分之五、現貨需要、本地廠商頗佳、出口問訊、除中國外、寥寥無幾、天氣順利、棉收樂觀、前傳雨水損害、目下認爲過甚其辭、附錄上週統計如下、（單位千包）</p>
<p>一九三○年　一九三一年</p>
<p>九月一日起收數累計　一○九　　　五五</p>
<p>週末現存　　　　　　四三九　　四七六</p>

<p>利物浦　上週現需繼續活動、惟實銷因某種質地之缺乏、而受限制、期貨方面、趨勢堅穩、雖有棉農套賣、多頭獲利了結及套頭抛賣之空額、均爲同業所吸收埃及棉營業靜寂、</p>
<h3>糧食河下米日見鬆落</h3>
<p>南頭昨日豐記碼頭來船念五六艘、去化不振常錫頂粳及蔴　新粳頻頻下瀉、高軟一角宿降二角百哥　種跌風轉靜、開盤各短一角半、至午後轉定、新陳蘆洋尖木曾見跌、市頂交易最爲暢銷變陰二元銷路尙佳、形勢難鬆、新客尖市銷平常、寗嘉來源凋零積貨有限、市情稍緊、</p>
<p>新閘昨市依然未見轉機、晨間各店號臨市人數寥寥、胃口極淡、内地來源不斷河下船貨尙多、人心看疲、常錫新買以宿次交易最呆、大盤降低二三角、窰種粗白稻埠尖等貨問訊甚少、行情各短近角、新陳杜尖走銷不爽、趨勢續低五分、惟變元酒作坊需要尙殷、價昻二角、</p>
<h3>洋米交易停頓</h3>
<p>昨日洋米市况、十分疲滯、國外市價最漲而難划、但進户胃口甚呆、均無意顧問、且十月十一月與九月份之抛貨均已陸續抵埠、客帮有意擯持、本街亦均觀望不辦、故全日未有只包交易、市面反見沉寂之象矣、</p>
<h3>期麥高後銳落</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上下午開盤後、各月份市面曾一度高昻本月份開價三兩五錢半、惟以後即逐步銳跌因市塲方面、一部分之近期多頭已非出不可遠期之一部分、則謠傳賑麥將抵麵粉、或則傾售以多量之物質、如果確向市塲抛售、則浮多之力量、决難担負、且據祥茂洋行之傳說、今年澳洲麥仍見豐收、不久即可登塲、恐此後之兜售、又將不免、因此人心大虚、紛紛暢出、本月份因交割關係、跌度尤甚、較上午最高之差度、達一錢七分、可謂出人意料之外也、結果本月份跌一錢四分、十一月份跌一錢二分、十二月份跌一錢一分、一月份跌八分、二月份跌六分、三月份跌八分云、</p>
<h3>粉市漲後大跌</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後各月份市面、因洋麥報價、又好三四五角左右、致業内外人心、自然趨奸、初開時曾較前週末好一分外、惟以後各盤則逐步鬆動、因銀根奇緊、廠家方面似人有傾抛之態度也、迨至下午開盤各月份市面則又趨變化、謠傳進口之美麥、政府將向廠方掉換麵粉惟以銀根關係、押欵爲難、致計劃不成、此項現麥、或須在市塲套售、所以人主皇皇、市面遂見低落也、結果本月份較前週末跌二厘半、一月份跌七厘半、十二月份跌二分、一月份跌二分、二月份跌二分二厘半、三月份跌二分云、</p>
<h3>南北貨黑棗地價轉升</h3>
<p>黑棗出新以來陸續有到、查市上存底甚爲單薄天津地價高至十四兩、次至七兩許、據青島電訊、已升十七元、此間客貨開過十八九兩、次至十三兩半、現在銷路尙屬活動、昨市行盤東昌棗頭售十九兩、頭高莊十七兩、二高莊十六兩、高統手十五兩、中莊十四兩半至十三兩六錢、市象穩固、</p>
<h3>絲茶廠經歐電仍不見轉</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊絲市、仍無發動、上週中法莊發往里昻等處之白廠經電報、昨仍不轉市氣呆滯、各絲廠類均預備暫停工作、以期保全實力、昨祇美莊補空、計乾利進白廠經三十包、祥利等進白乾經二十包、價仍疲云、</p>
<h3>絲繭下脚法銷亦滯</h3>
<p>祇長吐稍有需要···野貨均告沈寂</p>
<p>我國絲繭下脚、自停止日莊交易後、全持歐美銷路、野貨如市子·挽手·提手·尾巴·等向以法銷爲最暢近以海外經濟不安、絲織品銷路大滯、野貨下脚歐銷沈寂、巴賽里昻去電不轉、祇白長吐廠貨法銷尙稱不弱、價亦堅定、昨日信孚安旗等進絲廠長吐六十擔、價開一百七十八兩至八十二兩云、</p>
<h3>珍眉珠茶英銷略動</h3>
<p>昨本埠洋莊茶市、來路莊茶之珍眉珠茶、英莊錦隆怡和杜德等行、均起動辦、惟做開市盤、較前見低一二十兩、且無大宗銷胃、市面尙難認爲樂觀、貢熙一項、俄國協助會、依然觀望白頭行家亦因國外電報未覆、均無人問及茶市大勢、難免日趨衰落云、</p>
<h3>五金黑鐵皮銷路大旺</h3>
<p>黑鐵皮市面、就昨日趨勢觀之、頗有　勃氣象、蓋北路客帮如天津青島烟台諸帮、因天時關係、故多收辦、雖昨逢星期日、然成交仍有一千二三百札之多、致市上現貨被搜殆盡、標準趨勢因之節節升騰計每担估十一兩二錢半、但其後之使收辦者、仍多有人在也、聞在二三星期内所到之期貨、昨日亦抛出五百餘札、其價爲十一兩</p>
<h3>青鉛存底薄弱</h3>
<p>青鉛交易、雖連日客帮生意不甚發動、但本街廠家點綴尙屬熱閙、因此市面尙無十分冷　、惟到貨久少、所以市存薄弱、人心鞏固、標準有回挺之望刻市每担估十四兩七錢半、比前已好二錢半矣、</p>
<h3>煤炭山西煤走銷獨暢</h3>
<p>山西白煤、近來銷路獨　、　路客帮同行、均有大批買進、日昨杭嘉湖一帶裝去、共有四百七十餘噸、蘇州帮裝去、亦有一百七十五噸、售價均爲十九兩、本埠同行店家買進、亦頗不少、昨市塲成交約有四百十餘噸、價自十八兩八錢至十九兩一錢半不等云、</p>
<h3>雜訊湖絲一百二十件運往美國、</h3>
<p>核桃二千件裝至紐約、</p>
<p>美棉七千件已進口、</p>
<p>顔料八百件紐約裝來、</p>

<h3>太平洋學會第五日</h3>
<p>討論勞工問題及生活程度</p>
<p>申時電訊社云、太平洋國際學會、昨開第五日大會、圓桌會議上午九時十分開始、分四組討論、題爲「勞工問題及生活程度、」第一組主席巴恩第二組主席薩倫保、第三組主席奥石華、第四組主席彭尼支、十時五十分四組聯席討論、十一時五十五分普通會議、主席胡適仍討論該問題、十二時三刻華委員團公宴全體委員、下午二時半、特别圓桌會議、討論銀子問題、三時陳立廷招待全體委員開茶話會、六時一刻、十組會議、茲將討論之點、譯錄於后、</p>
<p>勞工問題及生活程度圓桌會議于昨日討論勞工問題及生活程及對於中國之新工廠法、亦經各委員大加討論並及移民問題工會問題與其影響人民之生活程度者如何、及以限制生産率解决人口問題之最後需要等、圓桌會議之主高爲日内瓦國際勞工局之巴恩氏·奥石華氏·美國加利福尼州勞動聯合會之　倫保氏·及菲律賓之彭尼支敎授關於新工廠法之評論可分爲兩派一爲實在主義者一爲理想主義者、此法所規定之標準、較高於現在中國般工廠所能實行者、一派以爲設立此種不能做到之標準未免錯誤不如較偏於保守方面、反可以立時得到實益又一派則以爲確立一較高之標準、縱使其祗能逐漸實現、亦可更爲有空國際勞工局委員某、謂上非實際主義與理想主義之分别、乃大陸方面與英國方面對於法律性質之觀念不同所致、按照英國標準法律所以規定實際所應作之事、並盼望此事能立見　實行、而歐洲各國與大陸各國之定律則先立一所欲達到之標準、與達到此標準之機械、而望其能逐步收效、如美國海員律、即其一例、當制定此律之時、美國各輪船公司主人多謂按照此律、將不能營業、且有以船隻售與外國公司者、然今此律並未取消而美國在太平洋上之輪船、反較從前爲多、此律並非在各地完全實行惟去其實現之時期、已逐年接近若無此律、即不能有今日之成績也凡各種法律必須得輿情方面之贊助、故中國工廠法之施行、同時必須積極進行敎育、注意於公衆感情及雇主與工人間之諒解、美委員力言公衆感情擁護法律之需要、未謂美國之海員律、雖未完全實行、然其成績、已斐然可觀、當可逐漸推行、至於禁酒律、則因其並未實行、故致失敗而應當取銷、足以阻碍中國新工廠法之完全實現者爲雇主之缺乏資本、工人之負困與夫雙方之缺乏智識及觀念錯誤、中國工廠多有極小者、對於工人之設備、如欲根本改良、必非其有限之資本所能勝任、即工人自身亦未受敎育、以達優良之程度、其家庭狀况尤有困難、若父母同入工廠作工、而拒絶其子女人内、則爲害或較雇用之者更大、中國政局不定、政府於租界内缺乏權力、亦足爲此法權行之障碍然可以適當之方法使租界内之雇主、自動合作、其最大之需要、則在從事敎育注意公衆感情、惟中國人口四萬萬、受此工廠法之影響者連同其依賴之人在内不過千萬人、而於保障出農方面、似亦應有同樣之規定、圓桌會議又討論移民問題及其與生活程度之影響、惟現今各國實際上殆已完全禁止他國移民入境、而人口過剩之國家、對於大批人民移殖他國一事、即無法律的或人爲的保障、亦漸知其不可能、故此項討論、僅爲學理的、移民他國者、其自身所受之益、爲衆所共認、在一定限度之内、移民國家、可以减少勞動問題之壓迫、並可接到由國外匯回之欵、而回國移民所得之新方法、與較高之生活程度、亦可於國内發生影響、然若其移民之人數太多致一部份工業之工人减少、或其人數太少、於實際上無足輕重、或因移民所生之空隙以生産率之增加、或死亡率之减少而自然補充則皆不能有上述之效果、在吸收移民之國家、因國内之生産與銷費增加、亦可獲相當之益、然而一旦達到不能更容之一點、即無利益可言、此點究竟以何爲準、大抵由於其國内人民之感情、非客觀所能决定、昔者愛爾蘭人民之大批移居美洲佔其全部人口中一大部份、此殆爲以移民方法解决人口問題之最後一例、今日本人口、每年約增加九十萬、若欲以同樣之方法解决、其勢有所不能即使世界上尙有每年可以吸收此大批移民之地、亦苦無如許輪船爲之轉運也、年來中國本部之人民、移居東三省等處者甚多、於减輕此項人口之各省、顯然有益、現擬由研究委員會特别研究由山東移民東三省、由日本移民巴西、及由菲律賓移民美國之影響、而尤注意於回國移民之智識及榜樣、影響於其家鄉社會者如何、此影響在日本之農村區域、頗有特殊之成績、中國工會之發達、亦經討論、現在中國之工會、與意俄兩國相同、爲一個政黨構造之一部份、與各國之獨立組織不同、此項工會於中國勞動界之情形、雖尙無一大影響、然其發軔之始、頗足與人以鼓勵、如得公正有識之人爲之領袖、則尤有希望焉各組圓桌會議所討論之各項問題、　後皆歸結於節制人口之一點小國之人口過剩者、加意利與日本即其例、因近世醫學衞生之發達、其死亡率突然大减、惟生産率之增加、其比例尙不如是之高耳更就他國之統計研究、凡於一二世紀前即發生此同樣之現象者、其生産率大都隨死亡率而减低、故意日兩國之人口過剩問題、當爲暫時的、更有進者、按照生物學定律、優良之生活環境、足以减低其生産率、人亦莫能出此例外、即在同國内、其最繁榮之階級、生産率常最低而生活程度之普徧的增高、每繼以生産率之普徧之减低、故此率常向兩方面進行、减低生産率爲改　其他狀况之必要條件、而引穩狀况之改良自能使生産率减低、凡此皆係自然進行、而與敎育及限制無關者也、</p>

<h3>北加浪華巫衝突經過（下）邱斌存</h3>
<p>四、對華的背景</p>
<p>北加浪岸士人之排華惡潮若就表面觀之不過一種無意識之暴亂行爲、假如更進一步去觀察、决不如是簡單、幕後必有帝國主義者從中籌劃、爲一種有組織之排華運動、一般人不察、竟誤認爲不足深慮之小事、其實士人此次之排華計劃、吾人不可小覯、最初不過以利刃鐵器、施行其恐怖政策、繼見僑胞處處忍讓、逆來順受、無隙可乘、遂改用手槍、夜半彈、擊傷黄君益厥、同僑果因此彈而激成罷市事件、此殆帝國主義者鼓盪土人運動第一步之成功、</p>
<p>排華運動旣用口頭宣傳、如揑造華商置毒於白米沙糖咖啡草捲烟等謠言、藉以煽動鄉愚、復利用新聞政策、乃就在三寳壟出版之巫文幸福報製造種種僞新聞、如放毒於食物裏等類謠言、居然認作實事、鄭重刋布、且製造「北加浪岸僑長李德祿中必丹被捕」之僞消息、說是、「李君因買三十枝私手槍、致被捕送進監獄覊押、」像煞有介事、又說、「陳英來君私藏炸藥、經警察在陳宅搜出、陳君就逮、」其實李陳二君絶無購手槍和藏炸藥事、被捕更說不到、該報之揑造此等消息、大約是有作用、李陳二君已向北加浪岸府署控告該巫文報、在荷豢養的官廳、那有公理可言、</p>
<p>又自排華惡潮發生而後、各鄉土民商店之産生、有如雨後春筍、而放毒謠隨之而起、以上種種是以證明土人之排華惡潮確有背景、至於最近禁止挑夫替僑胞挑水、及唆使奴僕勿在僑商店内或住宅裏服務、此不過一種壓迫手段、欲使同胞遷避耳、總之、此次北加浪岸土人之排華、是少數野心家受帝國主義者的嗾使與其本身金錢慾之支配、志在奪取外僑在商界現有之地位、所謂弱人頭上起禍端、同胞遂首蒙其禍、乃一般無知鄉愚、受彼輩催眠、不覺充當野心家之魔犬、</p>
<p>五、調解的經過</p>
<p>土人排華是因一時的受帝國主義者所愚弄、巫阿中覺悟分子、知道華僑究非他們的敵人、於是乃轉而謀種種所以調解之法、</p>
<p>（一）在北加浪岸荷蘭納署召華巫兩民族代表會議、參加者約六百人、但無多大成績、</p>
<p>（二）嗣巫阿官吏、又與華僑領袖談話、相約分别召集華巫兩民族會議、假座北加浪岸中華學校召集華僑大會、到會者約八百人、翌日由勒痕領導下舉行大會、到會者約二千人、以上兩大會、均得良好結果、嗣後地方情形漸告安定、</p>
<p>（三）華巫阿三民族各界要人、於上月十四日假座巫文商報總編輯沙伊倫住宅、討論排解北加浪岸「華巫兩族民族衝突」事宜、當塲議决、成立「排解北加浪岸華巫惡感籌備會」參加是日會議者、計有詹錦發君、林純绵君、亞哈西氏、沙伊倫氏、洪淵源君、梁友蘭君、黄昌愼律師、慕沙氏、嘉辣氏、愛塞哈孚氏、雅雅蘇嘉達氏、許藴棠氏、由該籌備會亞辣達氏、詹錦發君、洪淵源君、亞賴魯斯氏、摩哈末努爾氏署名、發出大批請柬、邀請華巫阿三民族社團代表聯席會議、地點在中華羣力運動會、日期是在上月十九日午前九時半、（一）討論組織排解北加浪岸華巫惡感委員會、（二）選舉華巫阿三民族代表赴北加浪岸、與該處華巫阿三民族領袖、共同排解華巫民族惡感、但須尊重當地長官、十九日三民族之社團代表相繼蒞塲、到會人數約百名、政治探部亦派員前來旁聽、即推舉亞辣達斯氏爲主席、亞氏就主席位後、即宣佈本日會議召集之宗旨、並請在座諸君各將意見發表、麥佛氏起謂、北埠惡潮、並非如詹君所謂、華人尙多隱憂、而士人方面亦多隱憂、故不能獨歸咎於一方、麥氏深望惡潮早日平息、亞賴都魯斯氏發表長篇意見、謂華巫民族感情至厚、應宣聯今組織社團、以便易以合作、如此次北埠惡潮發生後、苟有華巫各種社團必易排解、南洋民族對華人一切運動、皆表同情、華人方面亦然、所辦各報、對於南洋民族之一切運動、亦極宣傳云云、吧順蘭代表意斯簡達氏再將其以前在茂物開會之演詞重述、意氏謂南洋民族對於華人之各種運動、皆深表同情、而南洋民族對於華人之所表同情非常尊重、故對於此次北埠所發生之惡感、實爲憾事、並提議三民族組織之委員會速行成立、速派代表前往排解、意氏謂當一千九百二十五年亦曾發生小衝突、由下等階級人民起隙、愈演愈大、刻下之惡潮發生亦然、委員會之辦理此種工作者、應澈底查究、以便黑白分明、咎歸誰屬、有錯者、應行道歉、無錯者則以善言勸解之、惟各報所載、謂由於華人主重利者、及小商人爭論起隙、則意氏絶端否忍、據意氏所知、北埠並無華人放錢賬、願望調和不獨此次而已、應作爲長久之計、</p>
<p>洪君淵源謂華人係一最喜和平之民族華人僑居此地、數百年來主持和平、南洋民族之共同居者亦素和平、今華巫和平民族、突有惡潮發生、實爲一憾事、洪君并謂絶不贊成意斯簡達氏所提議、查究錯處誰屬、此種提案雖屬善意、行之則難、吾人之唯一目的、就是調和、已有得調和、才能分黑白、丘君文秀提問、謂排解有必要否、能收效果否、蓋北加浪岸已開二次大會議、并組織有排解委員會、二星期來再不聞北埠有何衝突案件發生、而惡潮之發生係在下等階級人民、而辦理排解者、則盡爲智識階級、詹君金發起謂、二星期來再不聞有衝突之事發生、但排解委員會所派之代表、係與該埠三民族領袖共同工作、誠恐再有衝突之事發生、沙益達魯粦氏謂此種小衝突、前日萬隆亦曾發生、而其結果當受損失、故望速行和平運動、請於實際上着手進行、方能絶本斷源、蘇里羅氏謂該惡潮並非發生於智識階級、當一九二七年發生衝突、惟土人開大會時、華人又表同情、爲排解此案、須選黨派外之名人、若有黨派之人任委員或代表之職、如日後辦理不妥、則其咎歸於黨派、北加浪岸衝突事件之發生、非此一次、皆由營業競爭起隙、故蘇氏對於此次之排解、非獨排解惡感、亦須調和營業競爭、北埠之種種案件發生、皆由宗敎、多由敎主主動、各有門徒黨羽、排解若不得門徑、誠恐愈趨激烈、</p>
<p>數月來土人鯨風鱷浪地而來的排華惡潮、經此數番會議調解後、方始言歸於好、相安無事、也算不幸中的幸事啦、</p>
<p>我們華僑遠托異域、與所在地的人民、尤其是與華僑惟一的出路的南洋的士人、賓主兩方感情素恰、北加浪岸士人這次的排華、設非有帝國主義者指頣氣使、士人决不會揭起這滔天的巨浪來、因此我們要忠告南洋各殖民地的士人全體、要了解我們華僑不是爾們的敵人、換言之、華僑乃爾們的良友、爾們要認清帝國主義者、才是爾們眞正的仇敵、我們也要希望我們居留在帝國主義鐵蹄下殖民地的華僑、對於留地的士人、要盡友善的聯络的能事、而極力避免與之發生惡感、對於他們士人的民族自决與反抗他們的宗主國的革命運動、我們要誘導之、鼓厲之、與贊助之、</p>
<h3>最近蘇俄實業概觀霖</h3>
<p>生産進步甚速</p>
<p>蘇俄努力生産、完全其五年計劃、世界商業今後將受很大的影響、這是一般人所公認的、現在蘇俄的國外貿易一天進增一天、她的出口貨行銷於歐美的非常之多、蘇俄的國際貿易、　在歐洲方面、以德國居首位爲最大、其次便是美合衆國、德國、美國之後、第三位輪到英國、這都是依據一九三一年即今年上半年的蘇俄國外貿易統計而論的、</p>
<p>一九三一年上半年的六個月中、從不列顚出口到俄國的貨品價値三三·○五一·○○○羅布、俄國的進口貨價値九二·二七七·○○○羅布、德國的貿易最大、出口到俄國的貨品價値一六二·七一八·○○○羅布、俄國進口貨價値七三·四二○·○○○羅布、美合衆國居第二位、出口到俄國的貨物價値一四二·六五二·○○○羅布、俄國進口貨價値一○·二一四·○○○羅布、俄國的進口貨物以工程機械及金屬品爲最多、電機工程用具和化學品也佔很大的數目、一九三一年開首六個月中、蘇俄的國外貿易共計八八三·五三四、○○○羅由、去年同時爲一·○○九·九九二·○○○羅布、</p>
<p>據蘇俄政府各部份的佈告、及莫司科西方營業局的商業統計、今年七月份、蘇俄實業大有進步之象、其中尤以煤·油·炭·及機械的出産爲最佔多數、今年七月中蘇俄産煤四·三七八·○○○噸、一九三零年同時的産額爲三·四○六·○○○噸、故較去年增加百分二十、蘇俄産煤的最大區域杜納士地方、七月份産煤三·一五五·○○○噸、去年同時計二·六五八·○○○噸、</p>
<p>各項實業之中最進步者當推電機業、今年七月、電機實業公司所出之電機材料共値六一·五○○·○○○羅布、（每一羅布約値美金五角）、去年七月出品價値爲三八·五○○·○○○羅布、各種電機材料之品質亦較前大爲進步、電機工廠所造之各項機械範圍極廣、具有高大電力之渦輪機·交換機·及無線電材料等、莫不有大量之出品、列寗拉特工廠所造之「司丹林」透平機、具有五○·○○○基羅瓦特、即其明證、</p>
<p>七月份中各廠所造之大件機器、價値二七·○○○·○○○羅布、去年七月爲二○·○○○·○○○羅布、增加將近百分之三十、七個月來承造大件機器之各廠家、其出品合計價値一八三·五○○·○○○羅布、去年同時爲一五二·五○○·○○截羅布、農業用之機器、其增進亦大有可觀、今年七月中「蘇佛士薩爾麥興那」所出之農業用機械、其價値爲三六·○○○·○○○羅布、去年同時爲二五·○○○·○○○羅布、增加有百分之四十五之鉅、</p>
<p>油類之産生亦較去年大有進步、今年七月共産二·○○○·○○○噸、去年同時爲一·六○○·○○○噸、如以七個月統計觀之、其數目仍極可觀、一九三一年七個月中、所産油類共一二·五○○·○○○噸、去年七個月之産額爲九·一○○·○○○噸、計共增加百分之二十七、　　炭之出産增加逾一倍有奇、今年七月機製炭科共出三四·四○○·○○○噸、去年同時則祇六·五○○·○○○噸、　　列寗拉持區之進步、處處咸極明顯、水之供給、其長度已從六百七十三基羅米突、增至八百六十基羅米突、溜渠組織自四百八十六基羅米突、增至八百八十五基羅米突、街車組織自一二四增至四一零、電車已增至一·○○○輛、路燈擴充至百分之七十、現在全市均燃電氣、戰前則用電者祇及百分之十九而已、</p>
<p>列寗拉特現在人口不過二·三九○○○○人、目下已用種種計劃俾其增至四·○○○·○○○人、預料第二個五年、計劃完成後、工中將有街車四·○○○輛、公共汽車三·五○○輛、僱用汽車二·二五○輛、尼哇河中之摩托汽舟其數將爲三百艘、第一部五年計劃完成時、列寗拉特中將有浴室三十五家、每一家有浴缸五百具、巨大之機器洗衣作亦將增至二十五家、以園之地基則增加百发之五十、</p>
<p>蘇俄對於汽車製造、亦極努力、目下已有兩大汽車製造廠從事於此項實業、第一家在莫司科、就舊廠基改建革新而成、内部均裝最新式之機器、此廠現在工作尙少、每年可産汽車二五·○○○輛、客車及運貨車均有、</p>
<p>第二廠係十月一日始開工者、名卡可夫造車廠、常年可造拖曳用之汽車五○　○○○輛、爲萬國收穫者式、政府及報界對此舉甚爲重視、咸謂影響於蘇俄今後之實業、爲功非淺云、</p>
<p>蘇俄煤油出産藴藏極富、向居世界産油最多國之第三位、五年計劃中對於煤油之産銷、亦曾規劃周詳、故蘇俄煤油業已佔世界貿易之重要市塲、而躍爲産油最多國之第二位、預料五年期中所産煤油當達四六·○○○　○○○噸之鉅、而其時期則或尙不需五年之久、</p>
<p>第一批之來華煤油計三·一○○·○○○加倫、已於九月二十二日由蘇俄産油區拔湯姆地方裝載起運、約於十月二十五日可以抵滬、拔湯姆地臨黑海、爲産油要區、以後將用油船裝大量之煤油、取道蘇彝士運河裝載而來東方、採油者爲一家組織甚大之煤油托辣斯、用鉅大之資本開採蘇俄全國之煤油、將來運銷東方及全球各地、預料營業甚盛、</p>

<h3>電車夫談抗日</h3>
<p>— 雯卿</p>
<p>在北市一個小小醫院裏的三等病房、看一位久不相見而睡在病榻上吟呻的窮朋友、同時、把自己買麵包的生活費分送了五元給她、又告訴了她目前暴日在遼東仍然横行的一些事件、我要離開她的時候、她也用了幾點感激的眼涙相送、待我走出院門、一陣陣的晚風、帶着深秋的寒意襲來、不禁使我的身上有點寒噤、馬路兩旁的牆壁上貼着反日的標語字條、也被冷風吹得在暗淡的燈光之下顫抖、馬路上的行人稀少、間或有一兩部黄包車在路上徘徊、尋找客人、忽然從遠處溜來幾響爆竹聲、嚇得弄巷裏的男男女女跑出來大驚小怪的東張西望、和互相抵聲細語、這顯然是一副凄凉的夜景呵、</p>
<p>我獨自步行至北四川路、那倒很熱鬧了、日本的陸戰隊、荷槍實彈很兇惡的在馬路上跑來跑去、中國的同胞們看見了他們、眼中就放出劇烈的怒火、恨不得把那些倭寇的屍骨毁滅灰燼、</p>
<p>在停車處等了一刻兒、一路電車來了、在平日三等車上的客人、總是擁擠得像一塊糖片上的螞蟻、但這晚車上的乘客眞是少得可憐、除了我以外、就只有一個五十多歲的老頭兒、那些在平日忙着售票、忙着開門、忙着騐票的電車夫、也像頭等車箱内的乘客一樣、安安靜靜地坐在長凳上、他們似乎是在談着東洋人是如何可惡一類的話、因爲我的手中握一本書在看、也没有暇時去注意他們所談的是些什麽問題、時而有一兩個客人、隨時上來、又隨時下去、把他們那很起興的話頭從中打斷了、后來、没有一個乘客上來、電車夫倒越來越多了、有的背着錢袋、有的拿着售票板、車箱兩邊的長凳上、差不多被他們坐滿了、他們像開會似的、大發抗日的議論、一個背錢袋的電車夫、手裏拿着一張晚報、他說、</p>
<p>「東洋人、交關壞拉西、他們佔領了我們中國的土地、殺了我們中國的同胞、我們中國兵没有打他們、他們反而很兇惡的在四川路找中國人挑釁、要是我們中國兵還不開槍把他們趕跑、恐怕他要把我們的上海佔去哩、」</p>
<p>「是呀、假若我們和他們打、一定要打勝的、中國人交關哩、現在商人、學生子、都組織了義勇軍、要是工人通通參加、那越發多了、就是我們也有兩千多電車夫、每人打殺一個東洋人、那末、也要打殺兩千多東洋人、每人打殺十個東洋人、那就要打殺二萬多東洋人、我們打、打、還是打的好、」</p>
<p>「儂没有槍、用撒某事去打、」</p>
<p>「大家要求國民政府給槍我們去打」</p>
<p>「我們不會開槍、怎麽辦、」</p>
<p>「開槍有撒難、一個月就可以學會的、」</p>
<p>「阿四說的話、很有勇氣、我們電車夫應當組織義勇軍、若是一個月能夠操練得會開槍了、我們二千多電車工人先跑上前去打東洋人、把他們打完了、我們還有功勞哩、」</p>
<p>一個高大的電車夫說了、他們在旁邊齊聲說、</p>
<p>「好、我們公舉你做電車夫先鋒隊的總司令、好吧、」他們說了又笑、</p>
<p>「你們不要恥笑我没有資格做總司令、在國難臨頭的時候、只要有勇氣跑上前去殺敵兵的人、那比做總司令還要榮耀哩、」</p>
<p>「現在說話的時候、似乎還勇敢、恐怕到上了戰塲又有點怕死了、」</p>
<p>「生在世上做亡國奴、不如死在戰塲上做救國鬼、」</p>
<p>「這個道理很對、我們應當爲救國去」</p>
<p>死、」齊聲說、</p>
<p>「要救國、就要組織義勇軍、我們没有時間去練習、這是根本的問題呵、」</p>
<p>「最好、我們向公司裏請求、早上遲一點鐘開車、晚上早一點鐘停工、每天可以抽出兩個鐘頭來練習、只要大家用心去學、恐怕一個月就有點門徑了、」</p>
<p>車在最后一站、靜安寺停着了、我獨自下了車、他們還在很興奮的討論抗日的方案、</p>

<h3>The National Government Hopes the League of Nations Will Continue Its Efforts</h3>
<p>The National Government's Declaration Hopes the Resolution Will Be Implemented Soon</p>

<p>Pu Wei Takes Office as Chairman of the Liaoning Four Peoples Maintenance Association</p>
<p>After the League of Nations Resolution is Passed</p>
<h3>The National Government Issues a Declaration</h3>
<p>Deeply Hopes the Resolution Will Be Implemented Soon</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government, regarding the League of Nations' passing of a resolution to resolve the Sino-Japanese problem, has issued a declaration. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>The Council of the League of Nations rejected Japan's proposal on the 24th and passed the original proposal of the Council. Although Japan firmly opposed it, the other members of the Council, such as England, France, Germany, Italy, Ireland, Guatemala, Yugoslavia, Norway, Panama, Poland, Peru, Spain, and other twelve countries, unanimously supported China's possession of the Council's resolution. From this, it can be seen that China's insistence on the immediate and complete withdrawal of Japanese troops is in line with international justice and righteousness, and has been confirmed and fully supported by various countries around the world. According to the resolution of the Council of the League of Nations, Japanese troops should completely withdraw before November 16th. This further demonstrates the League of Nations' opposition to any country using force to resolve international disputes. The resolution also suggests that after the troop withdrawal, China and Japan should organize a conciliation committee or other similar permanent mechanism. This especially demonstrates the League of Nations' efforts to promote peace. The National Government deeply hopes that the resolution of the Council of the League of Nations can be implemented as soon as possible, and hopes that the League of Nations will continue its efforts to ensure that the goal can be fully achieved. Our country's citizens should deliberately exercise patience and abide by the law to help the success of justice and fairness. The National Government believes that Japan will eventually respect world public opinion and, in accordance with the League of Nations resolution, completely withdraw its troops before December 16th, so that other issues can continue to be addressed to restore good friendship between the people of the two countries, and the foundation of lasting peace in East Asia can be consolidated.

<h3>The U.S. Government Closely Monitors Japanese Military Actions</h3>
<p>Will Take Appropriate Steps When Necessary</p>
<p>(Washington) After the League of Nations failed to effectively resolve the Manchurian issue, U.S. officials today expressed disappointment. The optimistic attitude recently held by the State Department has been sharply reduced. However, the United States has not yet planned to take immediate action. It is said that it is not willing to act alone, separated from the League of Nations, for the time being. In the next three weeks, the position of the Japanese troops in Manchuria will be a highly noteworthy event. It is questioned whether China will necessarily succumb and negotiate directly with Japan before the Japanese troops are completely withdrawn. Currently, the State Department is reviewing the detailed reports of the U.S. Consul General in Harbin, Hanson, and the Counselor of the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo, Salisbury, who are inspecting the situation in Manchuria. Now that the League of Nations has adjourned, the U.S. government's attention will once again be focused on the Far East. It is widely believed that after the League of Nations has exerted moral force on Japan, the second step will depend on how the Japanese government acts.

<h3>Japan Has Suffered a Major Blow Morally</h3>
<p>The League of Nations Can Take Further Action</p>
<p>Briand Says Clouds May Disperse</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Council of the League of Nations has extended its session to November 16th, but it is generally expected that if Japan does not withdraw its troops by the deadline, Shi Zhaoji, after consulting with the Chinese government, may request an early meeting. At that time, China may request the use of Article 15 of the Covenant, which stipulates that all countries in the Council have the right to take actions they deem necessary to maintain fairness and justice. It is believed here that the League of Nations has achieved an important success in handling this negotiation, because the Council has determined a non-retreating principle. If Japan does not withdraw its troops from the occupied areas by November 16th, the League of Nations will have no choice but to seek methods of compulsory enforcement. Yoshizawa set off for Paris today to resume his original post as the ambassador to France. Yoshizawa claimed that he will continue negotiations with French Foreign Minister Briand in Paris. Briand is also returning to Paris. The remaining members of the Japanese delegation are scheduled to leave Geneva tomorrow. Shi Zhaoji will stay here for another week before returning to London. Briand has received many telegrams congratulating him on his proper handling of the League of Nations affairs during the discussion of the Manchurian incident. Today, Briand also received a telegram from the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, thanking him for his efforts to mediate the Sino-Japanese negotiations and supporting the Council's resolution on the matter. Looking back at the events of the past few weeks of the League of Nations Council meeting, general opinion believes that Japan has suffered a major blow morally and feels that Japan's position has been indefensible from the beginning. During the last few meetings of the Council, the most intense debates were between Cecil, Briand, and Madariaga. Madariaga even made shocking remarks, asking the Council not to forget Article 10 of the Covenant, which respects the territorial integrity and political independence of each member state. When the Council encounters acts of aggression or the danger of aggression, it must deliberate on ways to fulfill this obligation. Although the Council decided to extend its session to November 16th, it also authorized the Chairman to convene a meeting before the deadline if he deems it necessary. (Dispatch from Reuters on the 25th)</p>
<p>(London) Although London newspapers have reported in detail on the League of Nations Council meeting, due to many domestic election affairs, they have not criticized the Council's resolution, except for The Times. The Times believes that the League of Nations can be said to be innocent in handling this matter. Although the Council's proposal is invalid due to Japan's opposition, it is still a carefully considered public opinion of the world's highest arbitration body. (Dispatch from Reuters on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Paris) French Foreign Minister Briand returned from Geneva this morning and went directly to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to have a long talk with Secretary-General Berthelot. Later, when reporters inquired about Briand's views on the Manchurian incident, Briand said, "Our reasonable expectations are no more than this, but at the moment, I won't say more." Briand also said that before November 16th, there is still hope that the clouds may dissipate, which is also expected. As far as the League of Nations itself is concerned, it is fortunate to have survived this severe test safely. Briand's view is quite representative of the general commentary of the French public. They all value the moral pressure of the League of Nations resolution, but on the other hand, they are quite worried about the League of Nations' inability to enforce the resolution. Furthermore, Japan has been humiliated by the League of Nations recently, and there is a tendency to become angry out of embarrassment. If Japan disregards everything and acts recklessly in the future, and the League of Nations has to take even stricter steps to preserve its newly gained dignity, the future is very worrying. Among the French newspapers, the only one whose opinion is clearly different from the above commentary is the Echo de Paris. The newspaper insists that Japan's attitude has not been understood by Geneva, and Briand may have tried to prevent the League of Nations from acting too hastily in order to preserve the alliance he deeply cherishes. In addition, Paris's most recent report also praised Briand's mediation efforts this time. (Dispatch from Guomin News Agency on the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Move to Key Stations Along the Ssupingkai-Taonan Railway</h3>
<p>Using Bandit Suppression as Excuse to Protect the Railway</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese military headquarters in Shenyang has dispatched troops to various important stations along the Ssupingkai-Taonan Railway to protect the railway. The reason given is the increasing activity of bandits attacking stations and trains along the railway. This move has increased the number of troops outside the South Manchuria Railway area. However, officials said that this was requested by the South Manchuria Railway because China borrowed money from the South Manchuria Railway to build the railway, using the Ssupingkai-Taonan Railway as collateral. The Ssupingkai-Taonan line is over 426 miles long. It is heard that the Japanese loan on this line totals 32 million Japanese yen. Japanese officials claim that Japan does not want to increase its troop strength beyond what is permitted by the treaty, but it may be necessary to increase the existing troop strength in Manchuria in order to replace the troops currently engaged in bandit suppression. The existing troops have been working very hard and need rest, but due to insufficient distribution, they cannot be allowed to rest now. (Dispatch from Reuters on the 26th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Ronin Make Trouble at the Heihe Diplomatic Office</h3>
<p>Extravagant Words and Actions Show Obvious Instigation</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The diplomatic community received a telegram from Beiping on the 25th, stating that at 1:00 PM on the 24th, two Japanese men, Shozuka and Sumoto, went to the Heilongjiang Diplomatic Office to see Director Wang, claiming to be dispatched by the Commander of the Kwantung Army to meet Chairman Ma Dai with a letter and carrying a letter from the Kwantung Army. These Japanese men were extremely barbaric, claiming that Zhang Haipeng's troops must arrive in the province, the Jiangqiao bridge should be repaired as soon as possible, and that Honjo would definitely implement the claim to restrict the return of military and political leaders in the three eastern provinces. Chairman Ma and Vice-Chairman Zhang, appointed by the Japanese, will never be allowed to stay in Heilongjiang. It is heard that the Heilongjiang provincial authorities are in earnest negotiation with the Japanese consul, requesting that the Japanese, whose actions are unclear and whose actions are erroneous, be strictly restrained.

<h3>Japan Persists in Its Evil Ways</h3>
<p>The Japanese Government Issues a Statement</p>
<p>Recognizing that the League of Nations Resolution is Not Established</p>
<p>The Warlords Still Want to Act Recklessly to the End</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government's statement explaining the fundamental principles of direct Sino-Japanese negotiations was issued by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 6:00 PM on the 26th. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the Council resolution on the issue of Japanese troops withdrawing to the affiliated territories and direct Sino-Japanese negotiations, and the Japanese amendment, the results of the decision on the 24th were not established. (2) The current incident was caused by provocations by the Chinese military and police. Japan did not use coercive means to force China to accept the conditions for resolving the dispute. (1) The Japanese government, considering the overall situation between China and Japan, expressed its determination that the interests related to the survival of the Japanese people will absolutely not be allowed to change. It has stated this intention on various appropriate occasions. At this time, China is chanting the restoration of national rights to the extreme and advocating anti-Japanese education, with a tendency to despise international treaties. If we rely on China's guarantee and withdraw all Japanese troops back into the affiliated territories, it will inevitably worsen the situation. This can be clearly proven by the history of many years. (1) In order to ensure the safety of Japanese people in Manchuria, the Japanese government is considering the following basic outline:</p>
<p>(1) Deny mutual policies and actions of aggression. (2) Respect the territorial integrity of China. (3) Thoroughly eliminate organizations and movements that hinder freedom of commerce or incite international hatred. (4) Effective protection must be provided for the peaceful business of Japanese people in various parts of Manchuria. (5) Respect Japan's treaty rights in Manchuria.</p>
<p>This is in line with the spirit and purpose of the League of Nations and is a principle for building the foundation of peace in the Far East. It is deeply believed that world public opinion will support it. The reason why the Japanese representative does not raise this as an issue at the Council of the League of Nations is because he is willing to negotiate directly with China.</p>
<p>(1) The urgent task today is to work together to clean up the situation for the purpose of co-existence and co-prosperity. The Japanese government still intends to start discussions with the Chinese government regarding the aforementioned issues and has not changed its mind. (Dispatch from the Japanese League News Agency on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Today, Japan's attitude towards the Manchurian issue is still to insist on withdrawing troops to the South Manchuria Railway area once the lives and property of Japanese residents in Manchuria can be considered safe. The Japanese government will continue to work hard to persuade China to negotiate directly. It claims that if negotiations can start immediately, the Japanese army will also quickly withdraw to its original station. A Japanese government spokesperson claimed that Japan believes that the outcome of the League of Nations Council is not detrimental to it. As for the Japanese warlords still holding an aggressive attitude, this can be seen in the fact that after the special cabinet meeting on Sunday, South Minister Lu declared that Japan's basic policy towards Manchuria cannot be changed by the League of Nations resolution. It is reported that the Prime Minister has entered the palace to see the Japanese Emperor to present the recent developments and Japan's position. Tonight, a declaration will be issued to the National Assembly of the Party on the League of Nations resolution. ● Japanese troops occupy key stations along the Ssupingkai-Taonan Railway ● Yan Feng Attends the Peace Conference, Representatives Set Off ● (See Important Domestic Telegrams) ● The U.S. and France Confer on World Economic Issues, Concrete Results Achieved ● (See Foreign Telegrams) ● Representatives from Beijing and Guangdong Hold Talks at Wu's Residence Yesterday ● Professors from Various Universities in Shanghai Express Their Opinions on the Current Situation ● (See Local News)</p>

<p>Party members of the political parties and members of the Legislative Yuan explained the developments in Geneva and Manchuria. Party members of the Upper House were also invited to attend. It is believed here that since Japan opposes the League of Nations resolution and does not assume the obligation to withdraw all Japanese troops before November 16th, everyone is focusing on Duke Saionji, who is reported to have departed from Kyoto today to stay briefly in Egawa, and then went to Kyoto to pay respects to Saionji.

<p>(Tokyo) Today's cabinet meeting discussed the resolution of the Executive Council. The Minister of Foreign Affairs reported on the actions of the Executive Council and requested the cabinet's understanding of the instructions to the Japanese ambassador to China. This instruction stated the Japanese government's publication of a statement and the issue of direct negotiations with China. The Minister of the Army reported on the current situation in Asia, saying that scattered soldiers and bandits attacked and destroyed several stations on the Ssupingkai-Taonan Railway, and looted nearby villages, resulting in the suspension of several trains. The Sanling station was also attacked, and the stationed Japanese army has been transferred to Zhengjiatun to protect it. The Upper House held a meeting this morning to discuss the attitude to be adopted towards the League of Nations resolution, deciding to fully support any actions of the government.

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Rebutting the So-Called "Special Rights and Interests in Manchuria and Mongolia" by the Japanese (1)</h3>
<p>The Japanese military has launched a violent aggression against our Northeast. The reason they declared to the world is that "China endangers their special rights and interests in Manchuria and Mongolia" and "threatens their special position in Manchuria and Mongolia." Japanese representative Yoshizawa even stated officially at the League of Nations Administrative Council that "The Manchurian and Mongolian issue is a matter of fact, not a matter of theory." As for how they obtained the so-called "special rights and interests in Manchuria and Mongolia" and "special position," they claim it is based on the sacrifices of the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese wars, having paid a "blood tax" in Manchuria and Mongolia. Therefore, they should enjoy special rights and interests in economic and political terms. They even say that even if they unfortunately become enemies with the world, they cannot change their position in Manchuria and Mongolia. Such specious reasons and arguments are quite capable of deceiving the eyes and ears of people around the world, and even more capable of arousing the biased emotions of the Japanese people, ultimately making it impossible for them to understand the truth of facts and theories. Therefore, it is necessary to refute them in strong terms.</p>
<p>In theory and in fact, what kind of legitimate explanation can be given to the so-called "special rights and interests," and whether there are reasons for its establishment, are the questions that we must first clarify. Interpreting the meaning of "special rights and interests" on the surface is no different from the so-called "sphere of influence." The division of this kind of "sphere of influence," or "special rights and interests," violates the principle of "respecting China's sovereignty" in theory, and in fact, it also destroys the integrity of China's territorial and political sovereignty, hinders China's economic development, and endangers the interests that the Chinese people should enjoy. Its impact on the world not only conflicts with the principle of "equal opportunities for all countries' industries and commerce" passed by the Washington Conference, but also easily provokes international suspicion and conflict, constantly threatening and persecuting world peace. Therefore, the division of so-called "special rights and interests" is actually an outward expansion of the power of Japanese imperialists to exclude the equal interests of other countries, which is also the brewing and manufacturing of the Second World War. Its only explanation is "power" or "force." Apart from this, there is no so-called legitimate theoretical explanation or factual basis.</p>
<p>Now, taking a step back, the Japanese always cite the Lansing-Ishii Agreement of 1917 as a basis for defending their "special rights and interests." Let us for now put aside the fact that this agreement was a kind of secret consultation and mutual recognition, and China was never informed of it and has no obligation to abide by it. Even according to the stipulations in that agreement, the so-called "special rights and interests," according to Lansing's explanation, are only limited to "economic significance and have no political significance." However, judging from the facts, is the behavior of the Japanese in our Northeast today purely limited to economic operations, or does it transcend economic significance and contain a huge political function? The facts are there, and the Japanese do not need to argue. People around the world will find it even easier to see clearly.</p>
<p>Establishing "special rights and interests" within the territory of another country hinders the sacred sovereignty that the sovereign country should enjoy, and even poses an extremely serious threat to the sovereign country, while still saying "they endanger our special rights and interests, and we have to take decisive measures for legitimate self-defense," thus disregarding the destruction of world peace and implementing violent aggression. It is difficult for us to understand how such actions can be explained within the scope of reason and justice. As we said in the previous article, it is nothing but power, nothing but violence. Explaining reason and justice with power and violence is less a defect in human morality than an indelible shame on human civilization.</p>

<h3>Promoting Peace Movement</h3>
<p>Generals to Issue Joint Circular Telegram</p>
<p>(Beiping) The various generals in North China, Zhang Zuoxiang, Wan Fulin, Ma Zhanshan, Yu Xuezhong, Wang Shuchang, etc., will jointly issue a circular telegram within the next few days, advising the Beijing and Guangdong factions to unite with each other, achieve peaceful unification, unite against foreign aggression, support the head of state, and jointly face the national crisis. The text is over a thousand words and has already been drafted. (26th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The contents of the circular telegram from the generals in North China are divided into three points: (1) Supporting the peace conference, (2) Hoping that compatriots throughout the country will not believe rumors, and (3) Eliminating personal prejudices and jointly facing the national crisis. It was drafted by Wang Yizhe, but Zhang Zuoxiang is not listed. (26th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) He Yingqin, Liu Zhi, Gu Zhutong, He Chengjun, Chen Tiaoyuan, He Jian, Liu Xiang, and generals from Jiangxi, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, and other provinces, jointly promoted a circular telegram for peace, and the draft has been signed by the listed generals. It is expected to be sent from Nanjing today or tomorrow. In addition to requesting that the Nanjing and Guangdong factions unite against foreign aggression immediately, the telegram also mentions that the national crisis is severe, and the head of state should not be easily changed, in order to stabilize the people's hearts. (26th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Huang Jichen and other overseas representatives attending the Fourth Plenary Session cabled Sun, Wang, Chen, Li, Wu, Zou, and other representatives of the Guangdong faction in Shanghai, requesting them to abandon all prejudices and come to Nanjing as soon as possible to discuss major plans. The telegram stated, "Zhesheng, Jingwei, Youren, Junpei, Tiyun, Haibin, all comrades, your trip north is aimed at saving the country, and the compatriots throughout the country have high hopes. The discussions published in the newspapers these days are full of opinions, but the goal of saving the country has not been put into practice. The representatives do not suspect that you have other intentions, but the diplomatic issues are pressing, and the international community is paying close attention. If there are further delays, it will only increase the arrogance of the violent Japanese and arouse the suspicions of other countries. The relationship here is certainly not trivial. We hope that you will consider the difficult situation of the country, abandon all prejudices, and come to Nanjing as soon as possible to discuss major plans." (26th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Tianyi and Xie Daqi of the China Youth Anti-Japanese National Salvation Corps went to Shanghai on the evening of the 26th to separately visit the representatives of the Beijing and Guangdong factions in Shanghai, calling for peace. (26th Dispatch)</p>

After it is passed at the meeting on the 27th, it will be sent to Shanghai for the representatives to adopt. (26th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Representatives of the anti-Japanese associations from all circles in the capital went to Shanghai on the evening of the 26th to urge the representatives of Guangdong to seek sincere unity, and also presented written opinions for reference. (26th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Saving the Economic Predicament</h3>
<p>United States and France Agree to Extend Suspension of War Debt Payments</p>
<p>Italian Prime Minister's Speech Strongly Advocates for Reduction of Reparations</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 25th: US President Hoover and French Prime Minister Laval jointly issued a communique from the White House today, summarizing the results of recent talks, indicating that there is a possibility of extending the suspension of war debt and reparations payments. The report also stated that the World Disarmament Conference next year should be used as an opportunity to lay the world on a solid foundation of peace. It also stated that the two agreed that financial stability is an essential element for the recovery of all industries, and that the maintenance of the gold standard by the United States and France will be a major element in stabilizing finance and fully restoring financial and economic stability. The communique also indicated between the lines that the two had tacitly agreed that even after the one-year suspension period for reparations and war debts expires, it may not be necessary to pay the full amount.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 24th: Deputy Secretary of State Cotton smiled and said today when presenting an important statement regarding the talks between US President Hoover and French Prime Minister Laval, "The baby has been born." The discussions between the US and French authorities included all international events. The statement strongly emphasized the necessity of the US and France maintaining the gold standard, expressed hope for the success of disarmament, acknowledged the necessity of establishing an international financial agreement before the expiration of the one-year suspension of war debts, and suggested that the most relevant European countries should promptly initiate negotiations on this international financial agreement. The statement also stated that informal discussions can indicate the nature of the problems that should be solved, but are neither binding nor establish specific procedures. We observe financial and economic difficulties with the same perspective. This understanding should pave the way for beneficial actions by both governments. French Prime Minister Laval said before his departure, "My talks with President Hoover will continue the friendly ties between France and the United States, and their results will benefit the world."</p>
<p>National News Agency, Naples, 25th: Italian Prime Minister Mussolini spoke to the public here tonight, strongly advocating for the revision of the Treaty of Versailles and the reduction of reparations, stating, "If we have to spend fifty years to write 'paid' on the tragic bill created by the blood of tens of thousands of young people, then we will never see the light of day again."

If one side is armed to the extreme, while the other side must sadly disarm, can we still say that there is justice in the world?" No less than 300,000 people listened to the speech this time. When Mussolini's words reached an impassioned point, the entire venue erupted with thunderous cheers. The people here and nearby were delighted by the Prime Minister's inspection as if it were a festival.</p>
<h3>Soviet Russia Replies to League of Nations Regarding Attitude Towards Disarmament Conference</h3>
<p>Stating that it must be based on the principle of equality</p>
<p>The National News Agency, Moscow, 25th—League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond recently sent a letter to Soviet Russia to definitively express its attitude towards the World Disarmament Conference in February next year.  The reply, dated October 19, was sent by Soviet Russian Foreign Affairs Commissioner Litvinov.  Its content briefly stated that the letter and the League of Nations Council's resolution on the disarmament matter had been received. The letter reiterated the proposals made in the letter of February 17, which had been answered on April 15, attaching a detailed table of Soviet Russian disarmament containing necessary information for the work of the Disarmament Conference. Soviet Russia also hopes for the success of the Disarmament Conference, but success or failure hinges on the recognition of the principle of equality among the countries participating in the conference, which is by no means a small matter. The Soviet Russian government will take this principle as its starting point, and will only recognize the right to handle the political preparations for the conference to those organizations and individuals participating in the conference on an equal footing with all countries. Furthermore, the Soviet Russian government's armaments list has been exchanged with Italy, Poland, and Finland, and other countries willing to exchange it can do so as well.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Central and National Government Memorial Week</h3>
<p>Dai Gives a Speech on the Lack of Morality of the Japanese</p>
<p>Lin Reports on His Trip Overseas</p>
<h3>Chiang's Reflections on the League of Nations</h3>
<p>At 9:00 AM on October 26th, the Central Party Headquarters held a memorial week in the auditorium. Central Committee members Dai Chuanxian, Chiang Kai-shek, Lin Sen, Ding Weifen, Chen Guofu, Chen Lifu, Fang Juehui, Cheng Tianfang, and others, as well as staff from various departments and guests, totaling approximately six to seven hundred people, attended. Dai Chuanxian presided over the meeting. After the ceremony, the chairman reported that Japan has disregarded public reason and justice this time and forcibly occupied the three northeastern provinces of China, committing various acts of tyranny. In this month, our people across the country have been deeply saddened and indignant, but have been very patient, firmly believing that public reason and justice in the world will never be extinguished, and unanimously trusting the League of Nations to make a fair judgment in order to achieve a final victory. The League of Nations is the cornerstone of maintaining lasting world peace, and any member state has an absolute obligation to abide by its treaties. However, Japan has violated this obligation and disregarded the spirit of the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the Nine-Power Treaty. Taking advantage of our country's natural disasters, it forcibly occupied our territory, massacred our people, and destroyed our buildings, with all traces of humanitarianism wiped out. Therefore, after this incident occurred, the National Government formally submitted a complaint to the League of Nations. The League of Nations' first resolution limited Japan to withdrawing its troops within two weeks. After the deadline expired, not only were the troops not withdrawn, but during this period, they launched violent military actions every day, causing all kinds of harm, and supplied a large number of firearms to bandits to cause chaos outside their occupied areas, resulting in a miserable life for the people. Our Chinese people have personally suffered, and people from all countries traveling in the Northeast have witnessed this. The League of Nations received reports from all parties and feared that it would trigger a war in the Far East and disrupt world peace, so it actively dealt with it. The United States also helped the League of Nations with justice and humanity to carry out its work. Representatives from various countries all expressed their sympathy for the League of Nations' peaceful handling of the Manchurian dispute. Although the League of Nations' second resolution did not fully satisfy the wishes of our people, public reason and justice in the world have been fully extended thanks to the great efforts of the League of Nations. Therefore, the National Government immediately ordered our representative to declare its acceptance. The key points of the resolution are to limit Japan to completely withdrawing its troops that invaded the three northeastern provinces of China by November 16. Looking at this incident as a whole, world opinion and the intentions of the governments of various countries have all expressed considerable sympathy for our country and nation. It is also felt that a country must be based on morality as the foundation of its establishment. From ancient times to the present, no country that has been able to maintain and uphold morality has failed to succeed, and no country that has destroyed and violated morality has failed to fail. In the future, it is hoped that the League of Nations can permanently uphold justice and achieve the greatest success in maintaining peace. It is especially hoped that our people across the country will be patient and calm, and strive to support all administrative and construction undertakings of the country so that they will not be affected by this incident and will continue to make progress, and make corresponding contributions to the progress of world human civilization.</p>
<p>Next, Lin Sen reported on his trip overseas, saying that there were three missions for this trip abroad: (1) to inspect overseas party affairs, (2) to comfort overseas Chinese, and (3) to raise funds for the construction of the Central Party Headquarters. The trip lasted eight months, and he traveled almost all over the five continents. When he arrived in Little Luzon, fundraising was quite enthusiastic. He raised 50,000 yuan on the third day. Later, seeing reports of domestic political instability, he felt very uneasy. Overseas Chinese are always very concerned about their motherland and are very enthusiastic. They said that because they could not make a living in the country, they traveled far overseas, always hoping that the motherland would be rich and strong. Although overseas Chinese do not want any rights, they can get help from their motherland if they are oppressed by the country they reside in. I went to comfort the overseas Chinese, but instead received lessons from the overseas Chinese, and I was deeply ashamed. However, it can also be seen that their hope for the motherland is very strong. The atrocities of the Japanese army in the Northeast were learned while passing through a Swiss ship. The ship had a wireless report of this incident, and all the foreigners on board were surprised. When arriving in Singapore, it happened to be the day when the Chinese commemorated national mourning. Men, women, old and young, all wore black纱 on their arms. Chinese newspapers published extra editions several times a day. Their patriotism was extremely enthusiastic. When he arrived in London, he went to see the room where the Premier lived when he was killed in the embassy. This building should be permanently preserved in the future, or it should be painted and imitated to commemorate it. The Premier's utensils in the room have been transported to the Liverpool Party Headquarters for safekeeping and promised to be sent back to the country for safekeeping by the Central Committee. In addition, the Wanqing Garden, where the Premier used to live in Singapore, has now changed owners. The Central Committee should prepare funds to buy it back and change it to the Premier's residence for permanent use. As for the donations to the Central Party Headquarters, they are all collected by the local party headquarters and directly remitted to the Central Committee, etc.</p>
<p>At 10:00 AM on the same day, the National Government held a Premier's Memorial Week. Chiang Kai-shek, Zhu Peide, Kong Xiangxi, Wang Boqun, Liu Wendao, Chen Bulei, Cheng Tianfang, Lian Shenghai, Li Shuhua, Lin Xiang, Zhu Lixue, Gu Yuli, Zhou Yawei, Chen Yi, Cao Haosen, Gao Weiyue, Zhang Wohua, Wu Siyu, and more than 300 officials from the National Government's civil affairs, military affairs, accounting, and other departments attended. After the ceremony, Chairman Chiang gave a speech on his reflections on the League of Nations resolution. The full text is as follows: "Comrades, what I want to report today is the resolution of the League of Nations on the Japanese invasion of the three northeastern provinces last Saturday. The process and content have been published in detail in the newspapers. I think you have all read it. The Japanese proposal was rejected by thirteen votes to one, and at the same time, the proposal of the League of Nations was passed by thirteen votes to one. This resolution that was passed, from the standpoint of our general public, has certainly not achieved the purpose we require and may not be completely satisfactory. However, if we observe the League of Nations from another aspect, we cannot but say that the League of Nations has done its best and fulfilled its responsibilities after all the hardships it has gone through, and we cannot but say that it has demonstrated the spirit and strength of the League of Nations. Therefore, we should also understand the position of the League of Nations and the hardships and efforts it has gone through in its handling. Our government, in order to respect the spirit of the unanimous vote of the League of Nations, has generously accepted this resolution. Since the League of Nations has passed this resolution, we believe that they will definitely be able to achieve the purpose of upholding justice and maintaining world peace based on this determination. Therefore, we further believe that the peace of the world has been more reliably guaranteed by the efforts of the League of Nations and the representatives of various countries. While we respect and accept this resolution of the League of Nations and enable it to be implemented smoothly, we also deeply respect the spirit of the League of Nations' struggle for peace and the efforts of the representatives of various countries, from Chairman Briand onwards, who have worked hard to uphold justice and maintain peace. Their efforts have simply opened up a bright path for world peace, and they are simply worthy of being peace envoys. Although the United States is not a member of the League of Nations, it also used its power to cooperate with the League of Nations. We also express our full admiration for his spirit of upholding justice and upholding public reason. We believe that the result of this resolution will certainly achieve the purpose of public reason winning and power succumbing, but we cannot but think of the power expressed by our country itself. This time, when the violent Japanese invaded our three northeastern provinces, the reason why we were able to get sympathy from the League of Nations was partly because the government had a firm determination not to succumb to power and was determined to 'rather be a broken piece of jade than a complete tile', and partly because the people across the country were consistently strict, calm, law-abiding, and patient, and did not take any out-of-bounds actions. Our country was suddenly attacked by the violent Japanese this time, and the entire people were able to endure what others could not endure under the circumstances of being very angry and very sad, strictly abide by the law, calmly struggle, and the expression of this spirit not only surprised all countries, but also made them respect us. They saw that our people were able to be so calm and calm in the face of this disaster, and the whole country was united, so they unanimously expressed their sympathy and advocated public reason to pass this resolution to maintain peace and advocate public reason. From this point of view, it can be seen that there is still justice and public reason in the world, and at the same time, the power of our extreme patience is also greater than the power of Japan's military violence. Now, at this critical moment, we must continue to do so in the spirit of calmness, patience, and perseverance, and wait until the League of Nations limits Japan to withdrawing all its troops from the occupied areas of the three northeastern provinces by the sixteenth of next month. I believe that the situation will definitely develop further. This resolution is the first step in the expression of the spirit of the League of Nations. By the sixteenth of next month, there will definitely be a second step in the expression of the spirit. As long as we continue to struggle in strict steps, we will never allow violence to overwhelm public reason, and we will never allow the ambition of one country to undermine international peace. I sincerely hope that my government colleagues and compatriots across the country will be more vigilant in the future and follow the Premier's admonition to 'continue to work hard to achieve the consistent teachings and maintain our spirit of patience, law-abiding, upholding public reason, and resisting power to the end'. As far as Japan is concerned, we are based on public reason in this incident, and there is no such thing as victory or defeat. Moreover, we are also very clear that Japan's unreasonable occupation of our Northeast this time is not the intention of all the people of the country, but the barbaric behavior of a few ambitious military personnel in their country. We should, of course, do our best to resist this barbaric behavior of their few military personnel, but we still have no hostility towards the majority of the Japanese people, and we believe that the relationship between the two countries for more than a thousand years and the originally good friendship between the people of the two countries are the foundation for establishing peace in East Asia. Due to the trend of this concept, we very much hope that the majority of the Japanese people will unite to urge their minority of ambitious military personnel to withdraw their troops as scheduled and correct this action that undermines international peace, and become guardians of public reason and peace. Our Chinese nation is a peaceful nation known throughout history. The Premier often used the four words 'trustworthiness, righteousness, and peace' to exhort comrades, and we have always worked hard in the spirit of these four words. As long as the Japanese people can urge their military personnel to thoroughly realize and understand the whereabouts of world public reason, and promptly implement the resolution of the League of Nations, the good feelings between the people of the two countries can be restored immediately. We hope that the Japanese people will thoroughly understand this and hope to eliminate the unfortunate traces of East Asia before the sixteenth of next month in order to maintain world peace."</p>
<h3>Japanese Urgently Plot Mongolia</h3>
<p>Sending investigators into Mongolia in five routes</p>
<p>Dalian Correspondence: Based on its continental policy, the Japanese have been secretly carrying out various plans and conspiracies to invade Manchuria and Mongolia for several years. Therefore, they have conducted in-depth research on the geography, customs, and various special circumstances of Manchuria and Mongolia. There is the establishment of the China-Japan Cultural Association in Dalian, which publishes more than 300 kinds of publications studying Manchuria and Mongolia. The South Manchuria Railway also has a Geological Research Institute, which sends personnel from time to time to measure the geography of Manchuria and Mongolia's fortresses in preparation for future military operations. In March of this year, Temman (South Manchuria Railway) convened dozens of Japanese rogues proficient in Mongolian language, and hired Mongolian paupers as guides at great expense to secretly sneak into Mongolia to spy on our country's border. The so-called Captain Nakamura was one of the investigators hired by Japan. The investigators were divided into five routes to enter Mongolia. The first route entered Mongolia from Chahar. The second route entered Mongolia from Rehe. The third route entered Mongolia from Taonan (the route taken by Nakamura). The fourth route entered Mongolia from Heilongjiang. The fifth route entered Mongolia from the Russian border. The investigators measured and photographed maps along the way. This secret work has been going on for several months, and the depths of Mongolia have almost been thoroughly explored. Since the Nakamura incident, Japanese investigators have left Mongolia one after another. As of today, there are still 27 people who have not returned. The Japanese troops invading Manchuria sent a military plane from Zhengjiatun on the 16th of this month to fly to Mongolia to scout the whereabouts of its investigators. As a result, all the investigators were found on the Daiping Plain in Outer Mongolia on the 17th. Immediately, 10 people were transported back to Zhengjiatun by plane. The remaining 17 people will still be transported back by plane one after another. It is conceivable that the Japanese are coveting Mongolia. Currently, Japanese people in various parts of the eastern provinces are doing their best to encourage those who are proficient in Mongolian and Chinese languages. It can be seen that the Japanese are urgently advancing their invasion of Mongolia. All middle schools in Japan have added Chinese language classes this year, which is enough to show the ambition of the Japanese. (October 19)</p>

<p>Important News Two</p>
<h3>The Process of Handing Over the Shenyang Municipal Administration</h3>
<p>Avoiding the Name, Achieving the Reality: Doihara Hands Over Municipal Power</p>
<p>Zhao Xinbo is the Only Popular Figure Under Japanese Influence</p>
<p>Bianye Bank and Guanyinhao Restore Restrictions</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: The municipal system implemented by Japan in Shenyang has recently been visited by envoys from various powers for inspection one after another. Fearing that their ambition to invade territory would be easily exposed, they decided to hand over the administration to the local maintenance association on the 20th of this month. However, there are very harsh conditions attached, including (1) After the Japanese side returns the municipal administration, the maintenance association must hire Bing Kezhuang as mayor (2) The police and education departments shall continue to be headed by Japanese (3) Expand the authority of the police and education departments. The police department shall govern the police of the entire province, and the education department shall govern the education of the entire province. The maintenance association shall not establish another education department (4) The education department shall urgently seek the restoration of large, medium, and small schools in the provincial capital (5) Hire Japanese consultants. Important matters must be implemented after obtaining the consent of the consultants. Bing Kezhuang was originally the Tao Yin of the eastern border and has a considerable relationship with the Japanese side. Therefore, the Japanese side specifically requested him to be the mayor this time. However, Zhao Xinbo, who sought glory by betraying the country, worked very hard. The commander of the Japanese Kwantung Army also allowed Zhao to succeed. Zhao is now the president of the Dongsansheng Minbao, the organ newspaper of the Japanese Kwantung Army Command, the supervisor of the security team of the maintenance association, and the president of the Shenyang Higher Court. He holds several positions in one person and has become the only popular figure created by Japanese influence. If he also兼任 the mayor, he will be the first giant among the traitors. Recently, some radical people have sent letters to Zhao, warning him to act cautiously, otherwise, the day the Japanese army withdraws will be the time when a white blade pierces his chest. Zhao was quite panicked and specifically presented the original letter to the Kwantung Army Command. The department specifically dispatched four Japanese soldiers to guard his house and courtyard every day. The scene was majestic and reached its peak. The Simin Maintenance Association organized by Kan Chao玺 was dealt a major blow after being ordered to be canceled by Honjo Shigeru. However, most of the affairs of the local maintenance association are still presided over by him. Yuan Jinkai is afraid that it will be difficult to protect himself after the Japanese army withdraws, so he handles everything back to Kan. Yu Chonghan has never attended the meeting because he has not recovered from his illness. Kan has not yet withdrawn his hands. Kan's son, Kan Duo, was appointed director of the Sipingjie Municipal Administration consultant, and his brother, Kan Chaogui, was appointed director of the Si Tao Railway Bureau. When Zhang Zuolin was in office, this man was the governor of Rehe. During the Guo Songling rebellion, he wanted to attach himself to Guo and seek glory. Afterward, he was dismissed by Zhang. For several years, he was hated by the people of the Northeast because of the 反骨 on the back of his head. Last year, he forcibly purchased the Yuanbao Dingzi Mountain wilderness in Jilin and instigated the army to strangle hundreds of farmers. Now he is actually in power in Shenyang. The Shenyang Finance Department and Industry Department have recently been ordered by the Japanese side to be restored immediately by Kan. Kan then appointed Weng Enyu as the Director of the Finance Department. The provincial tax bureau under the Finance Department is monitored by a Japanese consultant, Hamamoto So. Every day, he collects the money and remits it separately. The Finance Department also allocates 900,000 yuan per month to be deposited in the Dongsansheng Guanyinhao for the Japanese side to use. Therefore, although the Finance Department is nominally affiliated with the Maintenance Association, it is actually an external treasury of the Japanese army. It is rumored that the Director of the Industry Department was recommended by the Japanese side, and there are also some conditions involved, but the details have not been found out. The restoration of Guanyinhao and Bianye Bank was instructed by the Kwantung Army Command in advance, ordering them to comply. The original text is as follows: "At the time of the opening of the Guanyinhao and Bianye Bank in the three eastern provinces, this position specifically requests the local maintenance committee to pay attention to the following items. On this occasion, in order to restore public order and life, it is hoped that the finances of the old provincial government will be rapidly restored in order to truly restore the maintenance of the locality. (1) The Japanese army, in accordance with Article 43 of the Army Regulations, recognizes the start of business of the Guanyinhao in the three eastern provinces in order to ensure the convenience of restoring public order and life for the general financial industry. (2) When the Dongsansheng Guanyinhao executes its business, it shall do its best to ensure the interests of the Japanese army in accordance with Article 53 of the Army Regulations, and in accordance with Article 43, to ensure the restoration of public order and life. (3) In order to achieve the purpose of the preceding article, the Japanese army shall dispatch several supervisors to supervise the Dongsansheng Guanyinhao. These supervisors shall be recruited by the Dongsansheng Guanyinhao from Japanese side officials to serve as consultants or advisers, but this article is not limited to those who are recruited. The Japanese army may also dispatch supervisors at any time to inspect the Dongsansheng Guanyinhao (4) The Japanese army may stop the entire or part of the business of the Guanyinhao whenever it deems it necessary. (5) The local maintenance committee shall create candidates for business execution of the Dongsansheng Guanyinhao, which must be recognized by the Japanese army. (6) The Dongsansheng Guanyinhao shall absolutely not be allowed to engage in transactions that are hostile to the Japanese army or that have hostile intentions. (7) When the local maintenance committee gives instructions to those in charge of business execution regarding the business execution of the Dongsansheng Guanyinhao, it must receive the recognition of the Japanese army in advance. (8) The Guanyinhao in Dongsansheng shall not allow its branches in various places to work hard to make large deposits. (9) Regarding Bianye Bank, the above regulations shall apply. Judging from these restrictions, the reopening of the Guanyinhao Bianye Bank this time is directly a disguised Bank of Japan. The two banks issued a large number of banknotes in Liaoning. Since the 18th Incident, the banks have been closed for nearly a month. The sudden opening of business will inevitably lead to stampedes. The Japanese side dispatched a large team of armed military police to guard the two banks and imposed various restrictions on those who exchanged money at the two banks. Therefore, very few people exchanged money every day. Therefore, Shenyang's finances still show no activity. Recently, the Japanese side has been working hard to operate in various county towns along the South Manchuria Railway, such as Liaoyang, Tieling, Changtu, Faku, Fushun, Kaiyuan, and other places, about more than twenty county towns, all of which are protected by the Japanese side, ordering a few Chinese rogues to implement the takeover, reorganize the politics, and dispatch police stations to each county town to compile household registrations. Each county town is far from the city and inconvenient for transportation, so it is left to the Japanese side to arrange how to manipulate violence. As for the restoration faction, the meeting convened by Prince Gong Puwei in Shenyang did indeed open on the 20th. How to organize the Ming Empire that they planned to build must be decided at this meeting. Japan sent 11 representatives, including Doihara Kenji, to be high-level representatives. All plans have been drafted by Doihara and others. (21st)</p>
<h3>Mr. Fan Zhongqiao recounts his escape from Changchun</h3>
<p>Mr. Fan Zhongqiao sent a letter, recounting his escape from Changchun to Shanghai, saying: "On September 22nd, the day after the Japanese army occupied Jilin, all telecommunications were destroyed. Our negotiator, Gu Yurui, realizing the lack of communication, instructed me to go to the provincial capital to inquire and report on the situation in Changchun, attaching a report. Considering the strictness of Japanese inspections, I hid the report in my socks. At 8:30 AM, I boarded the train. Besides armed Japanese soldiers and Japanese war photographers, there were only a few Chinese people. Sitting next to me were two Japanese soldiers, and across from me were two ordinary Japanese people. They were exceptionally fierce, constantly staring at me with contempt. One said, 'The Chinese people on this train are like mice seeing a cat.' Another said, 'Indeed, not only the Chinese people on this train are like that, but all Chinese people in the entire country are like that.' They then discussed the situation on the battlefield. My Japanese is not good, so I couldn't understand everything. When the train arrived at Hadawan, five or six kilometers from Jilin, the Japanese soldier sitting next to me stood in front of me, raised his pistol, and mimicked shooting at me. The bayonet on the gun was only three or four inches from my chest. He asked me in Japanese where I came from, where I was going, what my occupation was, and what I was carrying. I said I was returning home. Just as they were searching me, another Japanese soldier came over, glared at me, and said, 'When you talk to Japanese people, you should stand at attention. Why are you so casual?' Under coercion, I reluctantly complied. He stepped forward, knocked my hat off, and searched my whole body. I was extremely frightened at this time. I didn't care about my own life, but I was worried about the report. After several minutes, he stopped, fortunately without finding anything. When the train arrived in Jilin, I was about to get off when those Japanese soldiers grabbed my collar, dragged me back onto the train, and conducted another thorough search, but still found nothing. After that, one of the Japanese soldiers kicked my leg and said, 'Go!' I was then able to escape. Driving to a friend's place, I saw Japanese soldiers along the way, groups every three steps, squads every five steps. Passing pedestrians were only allowed through after inspection. I stayed in Jilin for two days and returned to Changchun to report. Changchun City was quieter than Jilin, but there were many Japanese soldiers. More than ten days later, news came out that the main officials of the negotiating office had been arrested. Negotiator Zhou managed to escape to Harbin for medical treatment. I fled to Jilin. A few days later, seeing the tragic murder of the Korean military law director and the arrest of diplomatic director Shi, I left Jilin on the 13th of this month. When I was leaving, just as my car reached the main road to the city gate at Xinkaimen, leading to the outside of the city and the train station, I saw two cannons and several machine guns, with dozens of Japanese soldiers strictly inspecting pedestrians before allowing them through. Some women were insulted, some were beaten with rifle butts, some were beaten and detained, and some were cut with bayonets during inspection, causing bloody wounds. Such cruel acts were unbearable to witness. At that time, I changed from Western clothes to Chinese clothing and removed my glasses, thinking that I could avoid attention. Unexpectedly, I was detained because of my Western-style trousers and leather shoes. I was questioned extensively. Because I spoke some Japanese, I avoided torture and was released. I arrived in Changchun and took the South Manchuria Railway to Dalian and then to Shanghai. There were no unusual events along the way, only many Japanese soldiers and strict inspections. This is my personal account of escaping danger. I will also recount one or two acts of Japanese brutality as follows:</p>
<p>The tragic death of Korean Director. The Jilin Military Law Director and Provincial Committee (Provincial Party Committee member) was resented by the Japanese and Koreans for opposing Japan and interrogating Korean communist cases. The day after the Japanese army occupied Jilin, they arrested Director Han and imprisoned him in a secret room. Then they tied his hands and feet behind his back and stabbed him to death with bayonets. His bones were smashed with rifle butts and burned. His death was extremely tragic.</p>
<p>The arrest of Director Shi. Shi Luben, the Director of Jilin Foreign Affairs, had a tough attitude towards Japan. The Japanese wanted to kill him, but Xi Qia interceded with the Japanese side, and he was spared. However, all his property was confiscated, and he was given five days to leave the country. Mr. Shi fled to Dalian in a panic and was arrested by the Japanese army and taken back to Fengtian. His life and death are still unknown.</p>
<p>Robbery of money. The Yong Sheng Wood Factory in the city was stormed by Japanese soldiers, who used the pretext of inspection to rob thousands of silver dollars. Attention to intellectuals, party members, and students. After the Japanese army entered the city, they destroyed the Party headquarters, burned Party-related books, and arrested Party members and students. None of them survived.</p>
<p>Prohibition of Chinese people meeting with American consuls. On October 11th, the American consul in Harbin came to Jilin to investigate. No one, including Xi Qia, was allowed to meet with him. The Finance Director, Rong Hou, was an old friend of the American consul. The American consul visited him in his private residence. While they were talking, the Japanese called and asked if the American consul was there. Rong Hou replied that he was not. The American consul left soon after. Rong Hou knew that this would be disadvantageous to him and fled to Harbin. By the time the Japanese army sent troops to investigate, he had already left Jilin.</p>
<p>Construction of winter barracks in Nanling. Nanling was originally the garrison area of the Chinese army. After the Japanese army occupied it, they started building winter barracks, which have now been completed. All the land near the area, whether public or private, has been leased to the Japanese.</p>
<p>Arrest of the Director of the Telegraph Bureau. Tian Shuzhi, the Director of the Changchun Telegraph Bureau and Telephone Bureau, was over sixty years old and a very peaceful person. On October 2nd, he was arrested by the Japanese army, and his whereabouts are unknown.</p>
<h3>The Excitement of Anti-Japanese Sentiment in Shantou</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence, 16th of this month, several Japanese aircraft carriers and destroyers arrived in Hong Kong, removing their gun covers and raising the red flag in a show of force. On the 17th, they sent another twelve submarines to Hong Kong, all to demonstrate Japan's naval authority in East Asia. Overseas Chinese in Hong Kong, seeing this situation, moved their families back to their hometowns in Chaozhou and Shantou. Shantou has recently organized the Lingdong People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Volunteer Army, drafted regulations, and established a military committee. All citizens over the age of sixteen are eligible to enlist. Soldiers are responsible for providing their own equipment, and firearms are provided by the government. The military committee has six sections: General Affairs, Organization, Training, Propaganda, Management, and Armaments. All personnel are volunteers and receive the same treatment and training as the volunteer soldiers. The organization consists of ten men per squad, three squads per platoon, three platoons per company, and three companies per battalion. Squad leaders and platoon leaders are appointed by the military committee. Instructors are assigned by military organizations. In peacetime, they are supervised by the local government and military organizations. In wartime, they are commanded by the military authorities. The ultimate goal is to serve as a general reserve force in wartime and to lay the foundation for the implementation of conscription. The people of Chaozhou and Shantou are all focused on saving the country. Anything that benefits the country, no matter the sacrifice, is worthwhile. The people of the country are tired of hearing about civil war and yearn for peace. Because the fate of the country hangs by a thread, if there is a genuine desire to save the country, now is not the time to talk about conditions. We must unite and resist foreign aggression to strengthen our diplomatic power. This is the unanimous view of the people of Shantou. The sealing of enemy goods in Chaozhou and Shantou has been completely successful. The same has been done in villages, towns, and shops. This is truly a demonstration of unity. Guo Biren, the owner of the Menghua Villa in Mianhu, Jieyang, opened fire on students and the masses who came to investigate, because he was harboring inferior goods, killing Xingdao student Chen Hongxing and injuring two merchants. The Mianhu police arrested Guo, paraded him through the streets, and the masses held a meeting to request that Guo be executed by firing squad and that his property be auctioned off to compensate the families of the dead and injured. The matter has not yet been resolved.</p>
<h3>The Huai River Commission to Build the Huai River Dam</h3>
<p>Relief work is paid for with work, to be completed in six months.</p>
<p>The dam engineering survey team has set out to survey.</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence, the National Government Disaster Relief Commission, due to the continuous rain this summer and the outbreak of the Huai River, which flooded the Huai River area, causing disaster to the people, has specially issued 87,000 tons of American wheat to build flood control dams as a form of relief to help those affected. It has requested the Huai River Commission to send a survey team to assist in the project. The Huai River Commission immediately organized two Huai River Dam Engineering Survey Teams, which set off from Nanjing a few days ago. The leader of the first survey team is Sheng Dechun, and the leader of the second survey team is Yin Chengzhi. They arrived in Bengbu with several engineers and technicians and stayed at the Jiaotong Villa on Ermalu Road. According to them, the National Government Disaster Relief Commission's work relief project is to build flood control dams along the Huai River. The Commission believes that sending personnel to survey and build the dams is the best way to provide disaster relief and achieve both short and long-term goals. The first survey team will survey the upper reaches, and the second survey team will survey the lower reaches. The route of the flood control dam starts from Honghekou in Huoqiu in the upper reaches and ends at Fushan in Wuhe in the lower reaches, with a total length of 397.15 kilometers. Only the left bank will be built. The Huai River is the main stream, and the tributaries include the Ying River, West Fei River, North Fei River, Wo River, Tuo River, Hui River, and other rivers. Due to the interlaced relationship between the main stream and the tributary river dikes, they are divided into four disaster prevention zones. The initial work is to plan the route, divide the sections for surveying, determine the earthwork, construct culverts, calculate the slope, and, based on the shape of the main stream and tributaries, draw a new line or, if necessary, follow the old line. The height of the flood control dam is set at one meter above the highest flood level. Disaster victims are scheduled to be recruited at the end of next month to start building the dam. Two million workers will be needed above and below, and each person will be given flour daily in lieu of wages. The amount of flour each person receives daily is sufficient to feed a family of three or four. In this way, they will not have to worry about going hungry. When construction begins, ponds will be dug outside the dam line. The ponds will be square, and the mud will be used to build the dam, allowing for water storage, achieving two goals at once. The survey will begin within days and is expected to take three months. A month later, construction will begin as the survey progresses. It is limited to six months to complete. The Commission has now issued a notice, hoping that the public will protect the flagpoles erected by the survey team and not damage them. The first team leader, Sheng, led the survey personnel to the upper reaches of the Huai River from Bengbu on the 25th to conduct on-site surveys (25th).</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>The Anti-Japanese Association returned domestic yarn. The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of this county previously discovered four shipments of yarn purchased from the Yihua Factory, totaling 160 packages, at the railway station. Because the trademark paper had traces of use, it was suspected of being repackaged enemy goods and was detained. Samples of the yarn were taken to Shanghai for identification, but they were all groundless accusations. The next day, ten small packages of the same yarn from the Zhenhe Factory were detained at the court. They had the same brand as the yarn from the Yihua Factory, but the number of threads was different, further arousing suspicion. It was found to be produced by the Shenxin Factory. The Association decided to send standing committee member Lu Changlin to Shanghai to verify the truth with the Shanghai Anti-Japanese Association at the factory. Recently, Mr. Lu returned to Songjiang and reported to the Association that the yarn was indeed produced by the factory and that it was also recognized as not being enemy goods after being identified at the Huaxin Yarn Factory. The Association, after discussing the matter at a standing committee meeting at 7:00 PM tonight (26th), decided to return the yarn as it had been proven not to be enemy goods, and the factories will claim it.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Gaoyou relief representatives come to solicit donations. Wang Guoding, Tong Mingxin, and Yuan Huiyu, three representatives from the Gaoyou Flood Relief Association, came to Suzhou yesterday (26th) to meet with County Chief Wu to discuss soliciting donations.</p>
<p>Police dispatched to assist in suppressing lake bandits. Due to the unrest in the second district of Wuxi Water Public Security, where lake bandits are rampant, a letter was sent yesterday (26th) to the county government here requesting the dispatch of a police team to assist in the suppression.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Disrupting anti-Japanese work will result in expulsion from the Association. Since its establishment, the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of this county has been finding smuggled Japanese goods at the ports and unregistered Japanese goods in various stores like mountains. The fifth meeting has resolved that all seized Japanese goods will be sealed. Among them are over two hundred and ninety bolts of silk and cloth from the Tongfuchang, Qiantaiheng, and Yongfeng silk and satin stores that were not registered. According to people in the industry, when they inquired about registering the goods, Lu Gongquan, the director of the general affairs section of the Anti-Japanese Association, said that small pieces of silk and cloth did not need to be registered. Now that they have been seized and sealed, they have suffered huge losses. They negotiated with Lu, but Lu happened to be in Shanghai. They waited for three days at the ports before meeting him. He replied that he had indeed said those words and guaranteed with his character that the silk and cloth would be returned. Unexpectedly, after a meeting, they were still detained, and Lu published a statement denying the negotiations. As a result, the people of the Silk and Cloth Industry Association were quite indignant and also published a rebuttal to Lu's statement. Now, many people advocate that Lu, as a committee member, negotiated privately without following the rules of the Association, damaging the reputation of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, and that Lu should be expelled from the Association.</p>
<p>The Department of Civil Affairs sends personnel to investigate the tragic case of the shooting of farmers. Several thousand farmers in the tenth district of this county gathered on the eighth of this month to petition the district office to allow the exemption of surcharges. When District Chief Wang Hongyu learned of this, he sent dozens of police officers to meet them at the Diandang Bridge, where they shot and killed three farmers and seriously injured several others, causing an unprecedented tragedy. According to the district office, the farmers gathered to make trouble and intended to destroy the district office, so the police fired warning shots, accidentally killing three people. However, according to various groups and people in the district party headquarters, the farmers were actually demanding the exemption of rent and taxes and did not act in any way beyond the law. The district chief is suspected of ordering the shooting of innocent people. They have repeatedly filed complaints with the provincial government and the Department of Civil Affairs, requesting that Wang Hongyu be removed from his position and investigated. The Department of Civil Affairs has received repeated complaints and has had to conduct a thorough investigation, so it has sent administrative inspector Wu Zezhong to Changshu on the 25th. Wu first met with the county magistrate at the county government to explain the situation. It is now scheduled that the chief inspector of the Public Security Bureau, Lu Baozhong, will accompany him to Dongzhang City in the tenth district for investigation on the morning of the 26th.</p>
<p>Twenty-five hostages escape from Mocheng. After the robbery of Mocheng Town and the kidnapping of twenty-eight hostages, the bandits fled to Fengqiao in the Suzhou area and Luli in Wujiang. Shen Weixiong, the district chief of the third district of Water Public Security, commissioned Yang Jiu, the captain of the thirteenth team of the Changshu Water Police, as the commander-in-chief for suppressing the bandits and dispatched eleven teams, twelve teams, twelve teams, thirteen teams, and fourteen teams, and other ships to pursue and suppress the bandits. They have rescued more than a dozen hostages in Zhouzhuang, Tongli in Wujiang, and Luli in recent days. As of today, including those who escaped on their own, twenty-five people have escaped danger. Yao Jingzhi and other twelve hostages rescued in Luli on the 24th have been informed by the second district office there to the county government here, who have forwarded it to the families of the hostages to pick them up. They have all arrived in town one after another. Only Fan Zhang, due to illness after childbirth, is currently being treated at the Suzhou Guangji Hospital. However, Fan Shaoxi, Fan Henian, and Xia Enfu have not yet escaped danger, because the bandits mistakenly believe that they are the richest people in Mocheng Town and are keeping a close watch on them, making it difficult for them to escape.</p>

<p>County administration meeting resolutions. The county government of this county held a county administration meeting at 10:00 AM yesterday (26th), chaired by County Chief Chen. The matters for discussion were: 1. The chairman reported that the County Bureau had presented that the road tax collected should be transferred to the construction of the seawall dike, and the Construction Department instructed that it should not be allowed. The provincial government instructed that a plan should be prepared to determine how to handle the case. It was resolved to assign the Construction Bureau to quickly prepare a plan for the construction of the seawall dike and then submit a request for funds. 2. The cotton coats for the public security police team are urgently needed to be purchased, and the funds are insufficient. How should the funds be temporarily raised in advance? It was resolved that the insufficient funds should be temporarily advanced by the county government from the funds transferred by the former County Chief Pan. If it is still insufficient, it will be discussed to borrow from the city fund association.</p>

<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Wounding case due to vandalism becomes serious. Some merchants in Wujin vandalized the county party and other institutions for the issue of sealing Japanese goods.

<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Food Management Committee proposes loan-for-seed method. The issue of seeds in the disaster-stricken counties of Jiangsu Province has been discussed and decided by the Department of Agriculture in conjunction with the Provincial Food Management Committee and the Jiangbei Flood Relief Association. A portion of the American wheat used for disaster relief will be exchanged for seeds and loaned to farmers. The Department of Agriculture and Mining will send personnel to the disaster-stricken counties to implement the loan. Now, the Food Management Committee, considering that although seeds for winter crops are available, most of the disaster-stricken counties are rice-growing areas, and the need for rice seeds in the spring is more urgent than for winter seeds. If no efforts are made to purchase and store them when the new grain is on the market, it will be difficult to purchase them at high prices when the time comes. Therefore, it has drafted eight preliminary measures for loaning seeds and requested the provincial government to approve and implement them.</p>

<p>Education News Highlights</p>
<h3>Central University's Financial Difficulties</h3>
<p>丨Jiangsu Province's July, August, September, and October Expenses Deducted and Not Issued丨</p>
<p>Zhu Jiahua Repeatedly Appeals</p>
<p>National Central University was established in the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, decided by the Education and Political Committee of the National Government. It was formed by merging Southeast University, Hehai Engineering College, Shanghai School of Commerce, Jiangsu School of Law and Politics, Jiangsu School of Medicine, Nanjing Industrial Vocational School, and Nanjing Agricultural Vocational School. The original expenses of each school, allocated by the provincial government, amounted to 1.75 million yuan in the University District on behalf of the schools. Later, due to insufficient educational funds in the entire district, they were disbursed at 75%, actually receiving 1.32 million yuan, all disbursed under the Jiangsu education expenses. In the 18th year, the University District system was ordered to cease trial implementation. The school's expenses were resolved by the Executive Yuan to be permanently allocated by the Jiangsu Education Expense Management Office, at 1.32 million yuan annually, and 600,000 yuan allocated by the Ministry of Finance annually, totaling the university's expenses at 1.92 million yuan. In the 19th fiscal year, the school repeatedly requested an increase in the budget due to the addition of departments and expansion of facilities, but it was not approved. In March of this year, the Jiangsu Education Expense Committee decided that the regular expenses of provincial schools and institutions would be issued one month later than the regular expenses of national universities, thus initiating the delay in the expenses of Central University. Subsequently, the Jiangsu Education Expense Management Office also decided to suspend the issuance of 50,000 yuan of Central University's expenses each month starting from the 20th fiscal year. The school further petitioned the Ministry of Education to find a way to provide relief, but there has been no concrete response. Recently, the Jiangsu Education Expense Audit Committee accepted the request of the Jiangsu Central Education Joint Association and resolved that unless the Central University's expenses are resolved normally, no signatures will be granted, starting from the 20th fiscal year. The second half of June expenses for the 19th fiscal year have been withheld and not issued. Zhu Jiahua, the president of the school, has again detailed the origin of the Central University's expenses, which were originally allocated 1.32 million yuan annually from the Jiangsu education expenses, to the Ministry of Education, requesting that it be maintained. The submitted document is as follows:</p>
<p>Upon investigation, the school's finances have long suffered from tight turnover due to the Jiangsu Provincial management of education funds being delayed and slowly paid. Furthermore, due to the decision of the Jiangsu Education Expense Management Office to suspend the issuance of 50,000 yuan of the school's expenses each month starting from the 20th fiscal year, the foundation feels fundamentally shaken. The difficult situation has been repeatedly presented to your Ministry, requesting that a way be found to provide relief, but there has been no order with concrete guarantees. According to a report in the Shanghai Republican Daily on the 19th of this month regarding the petition of the Central Education Joint Association, it has been learned that the Jiangsu Education Expense Audit Committee has unilaterally accepted the request to completely refuse to sign for the issuance of Central University's expenses, resolving that unless the Central University's expenses are resolved normally, no signatures will be granted, starting from the 20th fiscal year, and withholding the expenses due for the second half of June of the 19th fiscal year. Although there has been no formal notification, the reports in the newspapers are likely not false. After reading this, I am deeply alarmed. This school was originally formed by the merger of Southeast University, Hehai Engineering College, Shanghai School of Commerce, Jiangsu School of Law and Politics, Jiangsu School of Medicine, Nanjing Industrial Vocational School, Suzhou Industrial Vocational School, Shanghai Commercial Vocational School, and Nanjing Agricultural School. The 1.32 million yuan annually received from the Jiangsu education expenses was originally a decision made by the central government. However, the Jiangsu Central Education Joint Association sent a letter to the Audit Committee stating, "The Central University's expenses are unreasonably encroaching," and also stated, "Central University is still wantonly infringing." The language is rude and insulting. The key points of their petition to Beijing include raising the issue of suspending Central University's expenses alongside the issue of declaring war on Japan, and claiming that the personnel met by your Ministry expressed sympathy, among other remarks. In a state of anxiety, I am deeply concerned. This school is the highest institution of learning in the capital, with a grand scale and an important bearing on the future of the party and the nation. Its expenses cannot be delayed. Since the central government has regulations, the school principal can only comply. Currently, the expenses accumulated in Jiangsu Province for the tenth fiscal year and the annual expenses have not been received, and the expenses due from Jiangsu Province for July, August, September, and October of the tenth fiscal year are again being withheld. If your Ministry does not urgently seek concrete relief, the school will be unable to maintain itself and will inevitably be forced to shut down. Since the principal took office, there has not been a day without being troubled by fundraising, running around and appealing, exhausting all mental and physical energy. Since August of this year, I have repeatedly appealed to your Ministry, and the difficult situation must be understood by your Ministry. Recently, the illegal requests and resolutions of the Jiangsu Central Education Joint Association and the Jiangsu Education Expense Audit Committee have occurred, and the situation is even more urgent. Therefore, I am submitting a clipping from the Shanghai Republican Daily news article on the 19th of this month and earnestly requesting that your Ministry quickly take measures to maintain the situation and provide guidance. I would be deeply grateful. Respectfully submitted to the Ministry of Education, with the attached news clipping. Zhu Jiahua, President of National Central University.</p>
<h3>Newly Established Junior High Schools May Not Simultaneously Enroll Second and Third-Year Students</h3>
<p>Ministry of Education Instructs Qingdao Education Bureau</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education, considering that the Qingdao Education Bureau presented that private schools have private school regulations to follow for application procedures, such as private junior high schools, which should be applied for in accordance with the law. Regarding whether the enrollment of students is limited to the first grade at the time of opening, and if there are indeed students with higher levels applying at the same time, it would be inconvenient to refuse. Can second and third grades also be established? The Bureau believes that there are no explicit regulations on this matter and requested instructions for compliance. The Ministry of Education instructed that according to Article 18 of the Provisional Regulations for Middle Schools, junior high schools may accept transfer students, provided that the subjects studied are the same, the academic level is connected, and there is a school certificate. Only those who pass the grade examination at the beginning of the semester may be accepted. In fact, newly established junior high schools can only enroll first-year students. Transfer students in the second and third grades cannot be accepted because there are no second and third-grade classes. This must be followed.</p>

<h3>City Education Bureau Held Tea Party for Principals of Primary and Secondary Schools Yesterday</h3>
<p>Expressed Connecting Feelings and Exchanging Ideas</p>
<p>Reported Three Newly Established Measures by the Bureau</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau held a tea party for the principals of primary and secondary schools in the city at 2:00 PM yesterday in the auditorium of the Bureau. Principals from more than 20 municipal and private secondary schools, including Municipal No. 7 Middle School and Minli Middle School, and principals from more than 50 municipal primary schools, including Wanzhu Fourth Elementary School, and principals from more than 40 private registered primary schools, including Sijing and Mingcheng, as well as Director of the Bureau Xu Peihuang and heads of various departments, totaling more than 150 people, attended the meeting. Director Xu Peihuang presided over the meeting and reported that the purpose of inviting all the principals to the meeting today was not to discuss various issues but purely to express the union and deeper exchange of ideas between the Bureau and the schools. The motivation for this gathering originated in the winter of last year. At that time, when the Bureau held a certification examination for primary school teachers, it deeply felt that there was an abnormal separation between the schools and the Bureau, especially the private primary and secondary schools. Therefore, this spring, due to the small size of the Bureau's office, it has gathered principals of various schools in four batches to allow considerable recognition. However, gathering in batches could not bring everyone together in one hall. Therefore, taking advantage of the expansion of the Bureau's office today, it was held again in one gathering to allow the principals of municipal and private schools to have the opportunity to meet. The Bureau's equal treatment and lack of distinction can also be used to mutually recognize each other. It is evident that after the gathering, it is hoped to be held several times each year. There are three other points that can be reported at this time: (1) The Municipal Primary School Joint Sports Meet will not be held again due to the current situation. Director Wang Mingchun will make a final decision. The Bureau has received letters from several schools asking about this and is reporting it today. (2) Regarding the Bureau's inspection of various schools, this year is slightly different. In the past, the Bureau's inspectors did not consult on school hygiene. However, now the Bureau has specially hired school hygiene inspectors to examine the hygiene of students in various schools. (3) The Bureau, considering that the reconstruction of the school buildings of municipal schools is quite difficult to start, previously required the Municipal Works Bureau to send personnel to inspect and then make a decision. However, this procedure is time-consuming and inconvenient. Therefore, starting this month, the Bureau has hired engineering experts to design the construction of municipal schools. After the report, the principals were invited to take a photo in the square outside the auditorium to commemorate the event. After the photo was taken, refreshments were served.</p>

<h3>Representatives of Students Studying in Japan Returned to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Students Studying in Japan Association and the Students Studying in Japan Returning to the Country Group previously sent three representatives, Zhong Wuwei, Chu Man, and Yi Mouhuang, to Beijing to petition the Ministry of Education for the second time. Yesterday, Yi Mouhuang had returned to Shanghai. According to the reporter of the New Sound Society, the petition to Beijing contained ten points: (1) Issuing nationalization funds to all students studying in Japan. The Ministry of Education replied that the National Government believes that it is not necessary for students studying in Japan to return to the country at the moment, and it is planned to temporarily not issue nationalization funds. (2) Accepting returning students studying in Japan. (3) Allowing students studying in Japan to transfer to other countries or domestic schools. The answer was that students at provincial expense who transfer to various countries will be given the original amount of subsidies by the provinces, and those who transfer to domestic schools will be assigned to national schools by the Ministry of Education. Initially, they will attend classes and must pass the university entrance examination or transfer examination before they can become official students. Tuition and new fees can be waived at school, and those who transfer to private schools can be reduced. (4) Order the Supervisory Department to retain the school registration of returning students studying in Japan. The Ministry of Education allowed it. (5) Allowing organized anti-Japanese work.

It was decided that there is no restriction on schools conducting public education services. It is only necessary to communicate with each other, and there is no need to change the name. On the one hand, the Bureau issued an order to the Shi Education Museum to pay attention to public education services and effectively discuss business with the museum to facilitate progress. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<h3>Dean Zhang Yuan of Laoda School of Social Sciences Lectures on Education Reform</h3>
<p>The Laoda School of Social Sciences held a memorial week yesterday, and Dean Zhang Yuanruo gave a sorrowful lecture entitled "National Salvation and Education Reform," stating that China's past prosperity and present decline depend on culture. Chinese culture flourished in the Yellow River basin era and declined in the Yangtze River basin era. The knot is that the intellectuals did not understand the true meaning of culture and were accustomed to decadence and did not think of revitalizing. In the future, the responsibility of the education sector should first be to remove this national aging nature. Labor education is the foundation of China's education reform and the key to China's cultural revival. The students and laborers of the University are tasked with transforming China and carrying on the mission of the past and opening up the future. They should be hardworking and set an example for the whole country, using Chinese and foreign history and facts as evidence. The long words are waiting to be organized and published.</p>
<h3>Jinan University Professor Tai Shuangqiu Compiles Education Administration Series</h3>
<p>Dr. Tai Shuangqiu, Professor and Director of the Education Department of Jinan University, studied education administration in the United States for several years. He has written a book on the Measurement of Efficiency in Education Administration, which was adopted as a textbook by the Teachers College of Columbia University. Recently, he felt that the domestic education colleges of various universities lack practical education administration textbooks, so he made a vow to write them. The published books include the Complete Collection of Public Documents on Primary Schools and Local Education Administration, Educational Survey, Educational Survey Forms, Classroom Reference, and Guiding Education Administration Inspection Standards Education Funding Issues, etc. Among them, the Book on Education Public Documents is especially suitable for practical use. Before the publication, major universities and schools in China successively adopted it as a writing textbook. The Method of Diagramming described in the Book on Education Survey has as many as 67 kinds, which is a pioneering work in the domestic writing industry. Many universities have adopted it as a supplementary textbook on statistics. It is heard that Tai's books are sold at the Nanshin Bookstore in Jinan University, Shanghai, and the Education Public Documents are sold by the Commercial Press, Kaiming Bookstore, and Life Weekly in various provinces. The Education Survey is sold by Zhonghua Bookstore in various provinces.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<p>The Sound of Resistance Against Japan</p>
<p>— Sleeping Buddha</p>
<p>Recently, both the Nanjing and Guangdong factions, seeing the violent Japanese occupation of the Northeast provinces and the growing national crisis, have sent representatives to Shanghai to openly discuss unification methods to jointly resist foreign aggression, for the sake of united solidarity. There is hope for peace. This is indeed a good phenomenon amidst national calamity. However, during the period when representatives negotiate terms, they should always remember the Northeast compatriots. Their cries of sorrow reverberate, enduring the Japanese's most cruel massacres and brutal floggings every day. Each additional day brings countless more sufferings. They should also remember the people outside the Northeast provinces, who are living in constant anxiety and sleeplessness, fearing that they will follow the fate of Korea and India. Since the representatives are seeking peaceful unification to pacify the interior and resist external aggression, they should quickly resolve the situation and achieve it soon. There should be no more repeated setbacks and wasted time. They must know that while they spend a few more days or months of leisure in the concessions, barely feeling anything in their lives, the Northeast compatriots under the Japanese's hoof and the people outside the Northeast are enduring killings and living in constant fear.</p>
<p>Remove Not the Court Grass, Talks from Zhaifu</p>
<h3>How to Learn from Edison</h3>
<p>The future world will be an electrified world; the future China must also create an electrified China; there is no doubt about this. Our neighbors, Japan and Russia, are already carrying out their nationwide electrification plans on a large scale. We must not be complacent and slacken our efforts. The most important thing for the electrification of China is electrical talent. Young students with similar temperaments should take responsibility for studying this subject. The best teacher we have right now is Edison. Learning from Edison is not just reading his biography and his invention reports. We must do the same as him, getting our hands dirty in electrical experiments, using our brains to think, to be worthy of being his students. This is not enough. We must do it every day, think every day, and put in the effort all year round, all our lives, to hope for success. Trying once, testing once, and then giving up will not make any great contributions.</p>
<p>According to Bryan, of his many inventions, only the phonograph was discovered by chance; the rest came from planned hard work. In order to find the most effective metal filament for electric lights, he experimented with minerals 1,600 times. He examined 6,000 kinds of plants to see which plant was most suitable for making carbon filaments. The nickel-iron battery that he invented was the result of 50,000 experiments.</p>
<p>Edison famously said, "Genius is labor and perseverance." The labor he spoke of includes both physical and mental labor. If you want to know if you have any genius in electrical engineering or any subject, you only need to ask yourself if you are willing to work hard and put your heart into it, and not stop doing it?</p>
<h3>Remembering Ma Wenlong of Qingdao</h3>
<p>— Bing Ding</p>
<p>Heroes of the Green Forest in the Northeast provinces, such as Xiaobailong of the three provinces, etc., in light of the brutal acts of the Japanese this time, have transformed their past Green Forest chivalry into patriotic zeal to serve the country. They have telegraphed all regions, willing to be pioneers for the nation, ready to fight with their spears at the ready, to kill the dwarfs and eliminate this dynasty. Their loyalty and righteousness are overflowing in their words. But those gentlemen like Xi Qia and Zhang Hai Peng are acting as accomplices for the tiger, willingly becoming slaves of a fallen nation. Seeing this, how can they not be ashamed? This reinforces the saying about heroes emerging from the grassroots and makes one think of Ma Wenlong of Qingdao, Shandong. Ma was a regiment commander under Bi Xinfang. He and Bi were sworn brothers. When Chu Yupu killed Xinfang, fearing Ma's revenge, he plotted to deceive Ma and had him killed in Jiayuan along with Bi. Before holding a military position, Ma was also a hero of the Green Forest. The area around the East China Sea was his territory, and he often lived in Qingdao. His subordinates numbered 5,000, and Ma was only twenty-two years old. He was good at shooting guns and could hold two Mauser pistols in his left and right hands. Riding horses in the wilderness, he could shoot birds in the sky with a hundred shots, hitting every one. It could be called a superb skill. His wife's skills were even more refined. Ma himself sighed that he was not as good as her. When the couple led their troops in Qingdao, they often instructed their subordinates not to rob the Chinese people at will, but to kill Japanese devils without mercy. At that time, Qingdao was still in the hands of the Japanese devils. Local public safety was maintained by their police officers. The Japanese police boasted that they were the best in the world. Ma treated them like weeds. Murder and robbery happened daily, all done by Ma's troops. The Japanese devils heard of Ma's name and faintly resembled Robin Hood in the West. His mightiness can be imagined. Once, three hundred Japanese police officers fought with dozens of Ma's troops at Dagang. Ma and his wife did not miss a single shot. In a short time, most of the Japanese police officers were killed and defeated. Since then, they did not dare to compete with Ma. Later, our country recovered 表岛. The Japanese devils wanted to carry out their treacherous plan and secretly bribed Ma to incite riots so they could find an excuse. Ma pretended to agree. When the time came, he did not take action. The Japanese devils were furious and wanted to eliminate him, but they feared him like a tiger. Ma then sent someone to tell the Japanese officials that if they did not return the island to our country, all the Japanese devils would die without pardon. The Japanese devils were greatly frightened. Then our country recovered Qingdao. After Bi arrived in Qingdao, he knew that Ma was a patriotic man and recruited him. Ma immediately maintained public safety in Qingdao. Banditry stopped suddenly. The Japanese devils were even more surprised by Ma's character. The Japanese devils in Qingdao were fierce. Countless rickshaw pullers were beaten. One day, a Japanese devil was beating a rickshaw puller. Ma saw it and rebuked him in a stern voice and slapped him hard on the cheek. The Japanese devil was angry and wanted to gather a crowd. Ma shouted, "I am Ma Wenlong. Anyone who is not convinced can come and compete." The Japanese devil, hearing this, lost his courage and scurried away like a rat. It can also be seen that the Japanese devils feared Ma.</p>
<h3>World Snippets</h3>
<p>— Hai Ke</p>
<p>French Hobbies The French have two hobbies that are almost universal: smoking and drinking. Every man pays an average of five pounds a year in taxes for these two hobbies. If calculated nationally, the number is alarming.</p>
<p>English Soldiers' Rubber Shoes Among the treatment of soldiers in various countries around the world, the United States is the best. England is also pretty good. Recently, many rubber shoes were issued to the soldiers on night watch in a barracks in Manchester. Because ordinary leather shoes make noise, they often disturb the sleep of other soldiers. Wearing rubber shoes makes it possible to move around without making a sound. Hungarian Telephone Recorder Hungary has recently invented a machine that can record everything a person says on the phone. Later, it can be reproduced like a record on a phonograph. It is said that the telephone company there will use this machine to calculate time and charge fees, which can greatly increase revenue. Most young men and women cannot help but worry that it will be inconvenient for them to communicate romantically with each other.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of Dr. Wu Tingfang</h3>
<p>— Wu Fei</p>
<p>Dr. Wu Tingfang studied jurisprudence in detail. His knowledge and morals have long been admired by people in society. Ito Hirobumi of Japan especially admired him. Therefore, when Li Wenzhong asked about Chinese talents, he praised him the most. Later, Li Gong entered the court and summoned him to be the chief of the Ministry of Justice. In the late Qing Dynasty, various political reforms were underway, and Dr. Wu was one of the earliest to study European and American laws, so he was used to reform the criminal law. It is said that when he was the chief, there was a case in the capital where a mother-in-law and daughter-in-law were at odds, and the mother-in-law committed suicide. There were major differences between the new and old criminal laws. The fact was that an old woman was resentful of her daughter-in-law's lack of filial piety and repeatedly thought of forcing her to return to her parents' home. However, she felt that the love between her son and daughter-in-law was very strong and could not bear to go against her son's wishes. Her son wanted to follow his mother's wishes and divorce his wife, but he could not avoid being sentimental. If he went against his mother and did not divorce his wife, the whole family would be discordant. There was no way to reconcile and ensure family harmony. He happened to be going away on business and repeatedly instructed his wife to serve her mother-in-law well and not make her sad. The wife agreed verbally but not in her heart. After her husband left, they were still at peace at first. Not long after, she accidentally failed to comply with her mother-in-law's wishes on other matters. The mother-in-law was extremely resentful and hanged herself in her room. Public opinion was in an uproar, thinking that the daughter-in-law had forced her mother-in-law to die. It was a serious case of violating ethics, and the crime was very serious. The matter was reported to the government, and her son was arrested and brought to justice. The case was judged, and according to the old criminal law, they were all sentenced to death as a warning to those who were not filial. The Ministry of Justice drafted the case. Dr. Wu examined the case again and again. He believed that the purpose of committing a crime must be based on intentional behavior. Although the daughter-in-law was not filial, the mother-in-law committed suicide and was not forced to die. Moreover, her son was out of town and did not know the situation. According to European and American criminal law, there was no reason to impose the death penalty. Moreover, when reforming the criminal law, it was still judged according to the old law. How could the entire reform be carried out? He argued strongly with the minister of the Ministry of Justice, but the minister maintained the old law and still imposed slow slicing. Dr. Wu believed that life and death were so different. Since he sought to save her life but could not, although the dead person would not blame him, the criminal law could not be gradually improved. Taking this as an example, the government outwardly promoted the name of reform but secretly implemented the old law. His ambition could not be realized, and his knowledge could not be displayed. So he resigned from his position. However, Li Wenzhi recognized his talent and still gave him tasks, consulting him from time to time. In the early years of the Republic of China, Dr. Wu was the head of the Republic of China Law School. I was one of his students and personally heard his lectures.</p>

The matter was discovered by the Chinese Navy, and the ship was captured. Japan was barbaric and unreasonable and claimed that our country had violated the law, forcing our country to apologize, compensate, and provide condolences. (2) In April, Japan forced us to establish the Yalu River Timber Company Regulations (ie the Tokyo Agreement) to obtain timber harvesting rights in the Yalu River. In name, it was a joint venture between China and Japan, but in reality, most of the power was in the hands of the Japanese). (3) Supplementary Agreement to the New Fengjichang Railway.

In addition, they requested railway construction rights from Kaiyuan to Hailongcheng, Sipingjie to Taonanfu, Taonanfu to Jehol, Changshou to Taonanfu, and Hailongcheng to Jilin.

<h3>Snowflake Chats</h3>
<p>— Wu Meng</p>
<p>Since the trend of men and women performing together began, Kun actors have become popular, and there is a trend of female prosperity and male decline. Kun actors are mostly qingyi and huadan, because women playing women do not need to be contrived, and it is easier to be liked than male actors. However, this only refers to the appearance and body shape. As for singing, those who are good at listening to songs still tend to choose men over women. This is because women's voices are mostly sharp and narrow, similar to what male actors call ghost voices. Even if the singing is good, listeners often regret that they cannot fully enjoy it. This is limited by natural talent and cannot be forced by human effort.</p>
<p>There is one person in this category, named Xue Yanqin. She is a true talent who can seize the seats of male actors and transcend the scope of Kun actors. Xue's voice is broad, empty, and well-balanced. Her performance is uninhibited, without the airs of a small family. Even among male actors, she is difficult to find. Recently, Beka has released its sixth series of new films, including Xue's "Qijie" and "Tanmu". Both are said to be excellent works. The two sides of "Qijie" are performed with Xiao Changhua. The original version has ten sentences, each with its own brilliance. Everyone praises the Nanbangzi tune of "It shouldn't have sold his daughter into prostitution". Of course, this is a given. The "Yan Lin" in "The second hateful Shen Yanlin of Shanxi" and the "Yan Lin" in "He shouldn't have poisoned Yanlin with medicine powder" have delicate tunes, but they use different methods. I think the tune of "Poisoned Yanlin" is the most original and pleasant. After the break, it continues, with the feeling of "after the mountain, there is another village". The sentence "Only you, old man, are a very good person" is simple and clean, without any dragging or sloppy poverty. This is also better than other actors. On the two sides of "Tanmu," he and Tan Fuying perform together. There are three best sentences in the fast board. The first is "He said that the Yang family generals changed their name and surname." The two words "name and surname" are paused, forcing out the word "change." I feel that it seems to have a different kind of charm that can be chewed on, which is not found in other actors. The second is "He misses his family and bones and cannot be reunited." Each of the three words "missing bones and flesh" has a small tune, light, clear, and fast, only in an instant. Careless people cannot easily understand it. The third is "What do you have to tell me in your heart." Each of the three words "What do you have" is paused, followed by the word "heart," then another pause, and then it pours down, accumulating enough momentum to make the listener's spirits lifted. Changhua accompanied "Qijie," with clear and smooth recitations. Fuying accompanied "Tanmu," with a pure and mellow charm. Both are enough to help Yanqin.</p>

<h3>The Pestle of Knocking on Dreams (25)</h3>
<p>— Cheng Zhanlu</p>
<p>"Layman, you are infatuated with the present world and don't want to come back! If not, how could this blow break your illusory dream! Layman, you have worked hard." The elder slowly put down the pestle of knocking on dreams.</p>
<p>"Old monk, the modern furnace can melt gold and iron. If not for your old monk's blow, how could I leap out of the furnace? "Yi Tao said, slowly leaving his seat.</p>
<p>"Layman, what are your thoughts on traveling in the present world?"</p>
<p>"I know all the reasons for China's weakness. I lingered in the past era, and I knew the distant causes of weakness. I sank into the present whirlpool, and I knew the immediate causes of weakness. Old monk, you can use the method of following the flow of time, so that the revolving chair follows the direction of the earth's rotation and increases its speed thousands of times. You can teach people sitting on the revolving chair to meet the world that people on earth have never met and foresee the future phenomenon. I feel that neither the past China nor the present China can satisfy my hope. I might as well spin around on the revolving chair and see the future world."</p>
<p>"No need to look at the future world."</p>
<p>"Old monk, since you allow me to travel in the past and present worlds, why don't you allow me to witness the future world?"</p>
<p>"Layman, the past world sows the seeds of the present world. The present world sows the seeds of the future world. You have traveled throughout the modern paradise. It is not difficult for you to imagine what the future world will be like. Why do you need to sit on this revolving chair?"</p>
<p>"Then, that's not good! In the modern paradise, the seeds planted are all the seeds of national subjugation, not the seeds of good. In the future world we imagine, we are afraid that we will be slaves to a fallen nation!" As he spoke, tears welled up in his eyes. "Layman, don't be sad. Maybe we won't be subjugated. It depends on human effort."</p>

<h3>Fluctuating Gold Prices in Financial Markets</h3>
<p>Wide Range of Fluctuations Yesterday, the 26th, gold prices rose and fell again, with considerable volatility. In the misty market, there were twelve transactions in the morning and evening markets. Dealers were unsure of the direction, appearing vague. In the end, it seemed stable. The buying and selling of major dealers were divergent. It was probably because the silver market had fallen slightly the day before, while gold prices were flat. Later, due to constant buying, and because several banks in the United States had closed, and the foreign exchange rate had risen, the Indian telecommunications company bought Huaiying exchange, so the market atmosphere was conducive to profits, and it once exceeded 710 taels. Unexpectedly, the exchange rate relaxed, especially with the major dealers tending to sell. It was also rumored that the situation in the Northeast was deteriorating again, and there was talk of violent Japanese increasing their troops, so people were terrified and fell by eight or nine taels. The market later considered it flat, but the situation was chaotic, hovering between 7034 taels and 089 taels.</p>
<p>The morning market was high and then low. It opened slightly higher by one or two cents, at 706 taels and five cents. Large bars returned by one-eighth, and silver prices fell by one-quarter. The market was flat. Then there were fluctuations of more than one tael, from 07 taels to 5.8 cents. In a short period of time, Hengchang, Yongyu, Darichang, Daxing, Yongyuanmao, Yong, etc. bought in and the price rose by more than four taels. The exchange rate was stable, and the British and Japanese banks each made an England Gold (English Gold) of 17375, so it rose to more than ten taels. The England Gold was announced at ten and a half taels. Only when the US dollar was listed as 31.125 was it 09 taels and two cents. Not long after, Yuanmao, Daxing, Yongqian, Changxiang, Fuyu, Yuda, Chunyuan, Yong and Mr. Wu successively entered. The US dollar was also very strong, making 31.625 to 31.6875. HSBC also absorbed 31.6875, so people's hearts were strong. It was estimated that it was pushed up to more than five taels, and at 10:00 it was 14 taels and six cents. Afterwards, Wupin, Zhifeng, Yongfu, Yufu, Changchang, Yuanheng, Qianchang, Xiang, Tianfeng, Yongheng, Changyong and various firms sold in place of Fengyong and Fenyong. In addition, the US dollar was sold to banks at 31.75 to 31.8125, so the gold price fell again by four or five taels. By 11:30, it had broken 710 taels. Then it was even weaker. Daxing, Yongju, Chang, etc. sold again and again. Until noon, it was 05 taels and eight cents. It was actually because of the news that violent Japanese had telegraphed reinforcements to Manchuria and Mongolia, and the atmosphere deteriorated. The midday closing was 06 taels and four cents, which then fell again by more than two taels to 04 taels and zero cents. The announced price was changed to 7623 taels, with an estimated deduction of about 50 taels.</p>
<p>The afternoon market tended to be chaotic. The afternoon market opened in response to the remaining atmosphere of the midday closing, and the Dalian gang first sold off, so it was only 02 taels and five cents. Soon after, buyers became active. Yuanmao Yong, Hengchang Yong, Zhifeng Yong, Qianchang Xiang, Daxing Yong, Mr. Wu, etc. successively and competitively entered. The banks also made US dollars at 875, so it had increased by five or six taels. However, there was a fluctuation of one tael from time to time. At nearly 3 o'clock, it was 08 taels and two cents. Not long after, it was suppressed by a little more than two taels to 05 taels and seven cents. Afterwards, it was heard that the bank absorbed spot US dollars at 9375, and HSBC bought England Gold at 17 halves, so the price of wind and cloud rose, almost up to 710 taels. Daxing Yong Zhifeng Yong entered tirelessly again. At around 4 o'clock, it was 09 taels and eight cents. At 4 o'clock, Fuchang, Dadecheng, Tongtaichang, Shunli, etc. suddenly sold off, and the England Gold seemed to be loosening, and it could be settled at 17.4375, so it fell by more than six taels. Until 4:20, it was 03 taels and two cents (it had dropped to 02 taels). At that time, it was heard that the Indian exchange rate had fallen by a small four anna, and it immediately rose by a little more than one tael, and the profit time was suppressed to 3.9 cents. At 4:30, the market closed at 04 taels and six cents, which was slightly lower than the previous Saturday by seven cents. However, it was raised again to more than six taels after the market closed. According to the maximum of 14 taels and six cents and the minimum of 02 taels and five, the difference was 12 taels and one cent, with violent storms, making it unpredictable. Wupin opened early at 06 taels, closed at 04 taels and five cents at noon, and closed at 03 taels and two cents in the afternoon, closing at 06 taels. It was estimated that 60 taels were deducted. Logged 06 taels, replenishing water 06 taels, 05 taels in the afternoon, the red strip was increased by eight and a half taels.</p>
<p>Different Transactions in Each Firm Transactions on the tables were very different. Statistics show that Yuanmao Yong, Dadecheng, Yuda, Chunyuan Yong, Yuantai, and Richang all entered. Tongtaichang, Fuyu, Daxing Yong, and Qianchangxiang entered and exited repeatedly, which was very cumbersome. Zhifeng Yong, Wanxing, Shunli, Cuichang Yong, Yuanheng, Fuchang, Futaiheng, Tianfeng Yong, Hengchang Yong, Wupin, etc. all exited.

However, British gold remained at 1 shilling 7.25 pence, and Singapore currency remained unchanged. Although silver prices fell sharply the day before, and the European market was flat with few transactions, the Shanghai market remained stable. However, the domestic market started tight and then loosened, weakening further in the afternoon, making the situation quite complex. Ultimately, British gold rose by 0.0625 compared to last Saturday, while the US dollar decreased by 0.125. The gold market was full of twists and turns, fluctuating around 710 taels, due to conflicting news and being entirely influenced by speculation. Chinese merchants sold off slightly, with tens of thousands of pounds of British gold changing hands. Bombay telegraphed to purchase some pounds for January delivery, and around 200,000 to 300,000 yuan of US dollars were traded. Banks absorbed some, and HSBC settled accounts.

<h3>No Easing of Credit Yet</h3>
<p>Market Overview: The current credit crunch has reached its extreme. Without significant relief, although there is ability to maintain, it is difficult to improve the situation. In the past few days (referring to Saturday and Monday), banks had some large pledges to handle, but demand far exceeded supply, making it difficult to meet everyone's needs. Therefore, it is difficult for overnight interest rates to fall quickly. As for the situation with subsidiary coinage, it has returned to its original state. However, as credit has not yet recovered, it is difficult to be certain whether the price of subsidiary coinage can remain stable.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coinage Interest Rates: The morning interest rate for subsidiary coinage ("yangli") was 7 mace 2 fen 7 li, and the afternoon rate was 7 mace 2 fen 7 li 3 hao 7 hu ban. This was only 1 hao 2 hu ban better than the previous day's afternoon rate, and the overall situation remained calm. The morning and afternoon rates for silver interest ("yin chai") were both 4 mace 8 fen, only slightly lower by 2 fen than the previous day. Overnight financing remained tight, so adding water to overdrafts still cost more than 4 or 5 mace. Bank rates were 1 mace 9 fen.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coinage Market Conditions: There was no interest in Jiangnan small silver dollars in both the morning and afternoon markets, so the price remained unchanged, the same as the previous day's afternoon market, at 6 mace 5 fen 6 li. There was no trading. The morning and afternoon prices for Guangdong small silver dollars were also the same, at 6 mace 5 fen 3 li, slightly lower by 1 li than the previous day's morning market. Trading volume was 140,000 jiao in the morning and 25,000 jiao in the afternoon. Copper coins increased by 1,000 to 379,000 wen, with a trading volume of over 31,000 strings.</p>
<p>Silver Dollar Inflow and Outflow: Silver Funds: Yesterday was Monday, and news of bank collections was slightly tighter than usual. Coupled with the end of the month approaching, there were many various payments. Chinese merchants collected 3.3 to 3.4 million in checks and drafts, foreign merchants collected over 3 million, various goods, foreign exchange, taxes, and miscellaneous payments collected over 1.01 million, pledge transactions over 1 million, intercity telegraphic transfers over 2 million, special payments collected 1.6 to 1.7 million, settlements over 3 million, 700,000 went into warehouses, 500,000 came out of warehouses, money shops and silver public units collected over 47.7 million, and overdrafts collected over 4.6 million. Various remittance payments collected over 800,000, and cash withdrawals were 300,000 to 400,000. Foreign Dollars: Checks and drafts were used for 1 million in the morning and 1.22 million in the afternoon. Banknotes were used for 90,000 in the morning and 45,000 in the afternoon. Off-exchange banknotes were used for 115,000 in the morning and 75,000 in the afternoon. Bank trading interbank trading was 700,000 in the morning and 800,000 in the afternoon. Over 1.9 million was collected and paid out in foreign currency accounts by various banks, 2.7 to 2.8 million was collected and issued in banknotes, money shops and foreign public units collected over 8.22 million, overdrafts collected over 2.4 million, interbank lending of foreign currency was over 1.6 million, transactions by small money shops were over 600,000, customer funds received were over 300,000, and funds paid out were over 400,000.</p>
<h3>Securities and Bonds Market Showed Mixed Gains and Losses</h3>
<p>Morning Very Weak Then Immediately Rebounded Trend Peaceful</p>
<p>Market Situation Quite Good Turnover Exceeded 15 Million</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 26th), the situation on the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange and bond markets, spot trading opened on many varieties, and transactions were not deserted, the futures market was still lively. The current and next month's futures trading were quite strong, except for the "Whole Six," the November futures have all opened. When it opened in the morning, market sentiment was weak, and each price was much lower than the end of last week. For example, the downsizing of troop's bonds and customs bonds had dropped about 1 to 2 yuan. Soon the market shorts slightly covered their positions and the small accounts gradually actively took in. Each bond recovered step by step. The closing price was similar to last weekend. The market for supply and demand turned even. Each price was stable without big increases or decreases. As a result, compared to last week, except for the "19 Good" October, which fell by 2 yuan and 1 jiao, the "20 Customs Bonds," "Disbandment," "Downsizing" "19 Customs Large Bills" and other spot prices each rose by about 2 and a half yuan. The "Whole Six" current month period fell 1 yuan and 3 jiao while other increases were better than the declines, generally only about half a yuan. The diplomatic situation has re-entered a state of depression. The League of Nations has adjourned and there will be no major changes for the time being. Its future will depend on whether the Japanese can abide by the restraints in my Northeast. In addition, the securities market is now approaching the delivery date. Large accounts are preparing for delivery matters, and their attitude is becoming more and more wait-and-see. Therefore, looking at the current market situation, it is difficult to have large increases or decreases for the time being. The total daily spot transactions were 28,000 yuan, and the futures transactions totaled more than 15 million yuan in the morning and afternoon. Also, due to the increasing complexity of the current month's futures delivery accounts, the Stock Exchange will reportedly suspend all transactions on Wednesday to handle the delivery matters.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn Market Affected by Credit Tightening</h3>
<p>The yarn market is calm, without any glory or disgrace to be distinguished. However, real sales are affected by the tightening of credit, and all parties lack enthusiasm, resulting in an increasingly quiet business. However, there is a shortage of yarn inventory on the market, as Japanese yarn cannot be circulated and domestic yarn is insufficient. Therefore, although transactions are light, the market can still be maintained.</p>
<p>People's Standard Continues to Strengthen: In the opening market, as American cotton was flat and weak, trading in the market was flat. However, new sellers were relatively scarce, and each month rose slightly by 5, 6, or 7 qian. The total daily transactions were 19,000 bales. It was found that Mingde sold 630 bales, Yichang 850 bales, Yiyu 850 bales, and Yongchang 650 bales. Gongtai bought 1,200 bales, Gengfeng 950 bales, Xincheng 1,000 bales, and Changfeng 650 bales. The People's Standard closing prices are recorded on the left.</p>

<p>December 160.7 Rose 4 92,800 March 160.7 Rose 2 63,350</p>
<p>Current Sales Very Light: Current yarn sales are not strong. It was found that all parties bought a total of 700 bales per day, and fellow traders bought 135 bales. The market was flat. Guest traders imported 160 bales from Jiangxi, 130 bales from the interior, 100 bales from Guangdong, 250 bales from Shantou, and 115 bales from miscellaneous traders.</p>
<h3>Reasons for the Cotton Market Strengthening</h3>
<p>The Gold Market is Stable Again: Buyers are Strongly Pulling Up</p>
<p>The cotton market is very strong, because the trend of American cotton is still good, and the price of gold is also stable. Therefore, the buyer's pulling force is particularly strong. It is said that some manufacturers are preparing to collect cash this month. Recently, they have seen that foreign cotton is good and have recovered their short positions, with no intention of delivering. The market atmosphere has suddenly tightened, and the rebound is getting stronger. Most people are looking at 4 liang, but there is little business in this cotton, and each factory has little intention of importing. Another 17,000 pieces of new Indian cotton have been purchased. The future still depends on the progress and retreat of American cotton.</p>
<p>Near-Term Han Standard Rises Uniquely by 90 qian: In the opening market, the Han Standard market was still good because American cotton rose and fell slightly. There were not many sellers, and each month rose by 1 or 2 qian. The total daily transactions were 121,200 dan. It was found that Jifeng sold 4,400 dan, Hengde 3,800 dan, Dafu 2,300 dan, Yicheng 2,100 dan, Yuanda 4,100 dan, Changfeng 3,500 dan, and Xinheng 2,900 dan. Taixing bought 5,500 dan, Lichang 5,000 dan, Shenchang 3,400 dan, Changfeng 3,500 dan, Yuda 3,800 dan, Gengfeng 2,800 dan, Xincheng 1,500 dan, and Ruida 1,500 dan.

<h3>British Indian Cotton Industry Weekly News</h3>
<p>Although the price of cotton between Mumbai and India made progress last week, it was overturned by the relationship between the rupee and the British pound. Therefore, the price of cotton is still about 5% above the peak export line. The demand for spot goods is quite good from local manufacturers. Export inquiries are few, except for China. The weather is favorable, and the cotton harvest is optimistic. The previous rumor of rain damage is now considered an exaggeration. The weekly statistics are appended below (unit: thousand bales).</p>
<p>1930 1931</p>
<p>Accumulated number of receipts since September 1st 109 55</p>
<p>Current inventory at the weekend 439 476</p>
<p>Accumulated exports since September 1st 323 143</p>
<p>Shipped to Europe 74 35</p>
<p>Shipped to China 71 56</p>
<p>Shipped to Japan 175 43</p>
<p>Other places 3 9</p>
<p>Liverpool: Spot demand continued to be active last week, but real sales were limited due to the lack of a certain texture. In terms of futures, the trend is firm. Although cotton farmers are hedging sales, and long traders are taking profits and hedging selling positions, they are all absorbed by the industry. The Egyptian cotton business is quiet.</p>
<h3>Grain and River Rice Prices Gradually Loosen</h3>
<p>Yesterday, 55 or 56 ships arrived at Nantou's Fengji Wharf. Sales were sluggish, and Changxi top japonica rice and sesame glutinous rice were frequently declining. High soft rice fell by 1 jiao, and the old rice fell by 2 jiao. The decline in "Bai Ge" rice turned calm. Each rice variety opened lower by 1 and a half jiao, but stabilized in the afternoon. New and old Lu Yang and pointed wood rice saw declines. Market top transactions were the most popular. The sales of "Bian Yuan" (variable yuan) rice at 2 yuan were still good, and the situation was difficult to loosen. New guest pointed rice sales were average, and the source of Ningjia rice was withered, with limited inventory. The market situation was slightly tight.</p>
<p>Yesterday's market in Xinzha still showed no turnaround. In the morning, there were few people at each store, and their appetite was extremely weak. The source of inland goods was continuous, and there were still many boats from the river. People's minds were tired, and the market was tired. New purchases in Changxi were mostly for old and inferior rice, and transactions were the most sluggish. The overall market lowered by 2 or 3 jiao. There were few inquiries for kiln, coarse white rice, Daobu, and pointed rice. The market each fell by nearly 1 jiao. Sales of new and old Du pointed rice were not smooth, and the trend continued to decline by 5 fen. However, the demand from Bian Yuan distilleries was still strong, and the price was high by 2 jiao.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Transactions Halted</h3>
<p>The foreign rice market was very sluggish yesterday. Foreign market prices were at their highest and difficult to calculate, but importers' appetite was very weak and no one intended to consult. Moreover, the goods dumped in October, November, and September have arrived successively at the port. Guest traders intended to reject them, and the neighborhood was watching and doing nothing. Therefore, there were no bag transactions all day, and the market appeared to be calm.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Fall Sharply After Rising High</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market saw each month's market rise once in the morning and afternoon after opening. The current month opened at 3 taels 5 qian and a half, but then gradually fell sharply. The market side saw that some of the near-term longs had to come out, and some of the distant-term ones were rumored to be shipping relief wheat to flour mills, or selling off a large amount of material. If it was indeed sold to the market, the floating long's strength would be difficult to bear. Also, according to the rumors of Xiangmao Foreign Firm, this year's Australian wheat is still expected to have a bumper harvest and will soon be on the market. It is feared that this subsequent selling will be unavoidable. Therefore, people's minds are greatly weakened and they are selling smoothly. The current month's decline was particularly severe due to the delivery relationship, reaching a difference of 1 qian 7 fen compared to the highest difference in the morning, which can be said to be unexpected. As a result, the current month fell by 1 qian 4 fen, November fell by 1 qian 2 fen, December fell by 1 qian 1 fen, January fell by 8 fen, February fell by 6 fen, and March fell by 8 fen.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Plummets After Rising</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market saw each month's market in the morning after opening rise, because the price of foreign wheat was also good for about 3, 4, or 5 jiao, causing people's minds inside and outside the industry to naturally tend to be treacherous. When it first opened, it was better by 1 fen than the previous weekend. However, each price then gradually loosened, because credit was extremely tight, and manufacturers seemed to have a tendency to dump goods. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, each month's market had changed again. It was rumored that the government would exchange imported American wheat for flour from factories, but the plan failed due to the difficulty of pledging loans due to credit relations. This spot wheat may have to be sold on the market, so people were panicking and the market saw a decline. As a result, the current month fell by 2 and a half li compared to the previous weekend, January fell by 7 and a half li, December fell by 2 fen, January fell by 2 fen, February fell by 2 fen 2 and a half li, and March fell by 2 fen.</p>
<h3>Northern and Southern Goods: Black Dates and Land Prices Turn Upwards</h3>
<p>Since the new black dates have been produced, they have arrived one after another. The existing inventory on the market is very thin. The land price in Tianjin is as high as 14 taels, and the second highest is about 7 taels. According to Qingdao telegraphic messages, it has risen to 17 yuan. Guest goods here have been opened at 18 or 19 taels, and the second highest is 13 and a half taels. Sales are still active now. Yesterday, the market sold Dongchang jujube heads for 19 taels, head Gaozhuang for 17 taels, second Gaozhuang for 16 taels, Gao Tongshou for 15 taels, and middle Zhuang for 14 and a half taels to 13 taels 6 qian. The market situation is stable.</p>
<h3>Silk Tea Factories' European Telegrams Still Show No Turnaround</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Foreign Bank Silk Market still did not launch. The white factory silk sent by French and Chinese banks to Lyon and other places last week did not turn around yesterday. The market atmosphere was sluggish. Each silk factory prepared to temporarily suspend work in order to preserve its strength. Only American banks made up short positions. Ganli imported 30 bales of white factory silk, and Xiangli imported 20 bales of white dry silk. The price was still tired.</p>
<h3>Silk Cocoon Waste: French Sales Also Stagnant</h3>
<p>Only long silk floss is slightly in demand... wild goods are all silent</p>
<p>After the domestic silk cocoon waste stopped trading with Japanese banks, it was entirely supported by European and American sales. Wild goods such as city children, wrist handles, tote handles, and tails were most smoothly sold to France in the past. Recently, overseas economic conditions have been unstable, and sales of silk fabrics have been greatly stagnant. The European sales of wild goods and waste are silent. The messages from Basel and Lyon did not turn around. Only the French sales of white long silk floss from the factory were still not weak, and the price was also firm. Yesterday, Xinfu Anqi and others imported 60 dan of long silk floss from silk factories, and the price was opened at 178 taels to 82 taels.</p>
<h3>Zhenmei Pearl Tea: English Sales Move Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the Shanghai Foreign Bank Tea Market, the Zhenmei pearl tea from tea merchants from various sources was started by English banks Jinlong Yihuo and Dudu and other companies. However, the opening market was lower by 10 to 20 taels than before, and there were no large sales. The market was difficult to be considered optimistic. As for Gongxi, the Russian Assistance Association was still watching. White-headed traders also did not ask because the foreign telegraphic messages had not been answered. The overall trend of the tea market was inevitably declining.</p>
<h3>Metals: Black Iron Sheet Sales are Booming</h3>
<p>The black iron sheet market, judging from yesterday's trend, had a quite high-spirited atmosphere. Because of the weather, northern guest traders such as Tianjin, Qingdao, and Yantai collected a lot. Although yesterday was Sunday, there were still as many as 1,200 to 1,300 bundles in the transactions, causing the spot goods on the market to be almost completely searched. The standard trend has risen steadily. It is estimated that each dan is 11 taels 2 qian and a half. However, there were still many people who later had them collected. It was reported that 500 bundles of the futures that arrived in 2 or 3 weeks were also sold yesterday. The price was 11 taels.</p>
<h3>Blue Lead Inventory is Weak</h3>
<p>Although the blue lead trade has not been very active for guest traders for many days, the finishing touches by local manufacturers are still lively. Therefore, the market is not very cold, but the arrival of goods has been small for a long time, so the market inventory is weak and people's minds are consolidated. The standard has a chance to rebound. At the moment, the market is estimated to be 14 taels 7 qian and a half per dan, which is 2 qian and a half better than before.</p>
<h3>Coal: Shanxi Coal Sales are Smooth and Unique</h3>
<p>Recently, Shanxi white coal sales have been smooth and unique. Traders from Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou have bought in large quantities. Yesterday, a total of more than 470 tons were loaded to the area, and 175 tons were also loaded to Suzhou. The selling price was 19 taels. Local traders and stores have also bought quite a lot. Yesterday, about 410 tons were traded in the market. The price ranged from 18 taels 8 qian to 19 taels 1 qian and a half.</p>

<p>According to a joint statement released by Cai Yuanpei and Wang Jingwei yesterday regarding the results of the discussion, the meeting today will not be the first official meeting due to the absence of Mr. Li Shizeng. It will be a discussion in nature. The first topic discussed was foreign policy, and the following two points were agreed upon by all: (1) We greatly appreciate the international community's ability to advocate for justice. We have heard that some abroad are advocating withdrawal from the League of Nations, which we believe to be an emotional outburst of patriotic fervor. Japan's invasion and occupation of Northeast China is a completely unreasonable act, not only infringing upon our country's territorial sovereignty but also violating the League of Nations Covenant and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. We should make it clear to people around the world that they should unanimously oppose Japan's actions, as it not only concerns China's territorial sovereignty but also the future of the League of Nations and the dignity of all signatory countries of the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Therefore, the League of Nations and all signatory countries of the Kellogg-Briand Pact have a responsibility to bear. Our people should understand that Japan is now in an isolated position and should not advocate for withdrawal from the League of Nations but should urge the League of Nations to implement its spirit of advocating justice to suppress Japan's tyranny. (2) We have also heard that some abroad are advocating the immediate resumption of diplomatic relations with Russia. This is a separate issue and should not be discussed in the same context as the issue with Japan. This discussion is sufficient to demonstrate the Kuomintang's united spirit towards foreign affairs. Although other issues were also discussed, they are still in the process of exchanging opinions.</p>
<p>Meeting to Be Held This Morning</p>
<p>After the Beijing and Guangdong representatives completed their discussion at Wu's residence, they drove to visit Mr. Hu Hanmin to report on the results of the discussion and further discuss the content. Hu expressed his agreement with the content of the discussion between the representatives. At around 6:00 PM, the representatives from both sides bid farewell to Hu and returned. It was decided during yesterday's discussion that the first preparatory meeting would be held at 9:00 AM this morning at Wu Chaoshu's residence, No. 29 Gordon Road.</p>
<p>Letter from Guangdong Representatives to Chiang Kai-shek</p>
<p>Respectful greetings to Mr. Kai-shek,</p>
<p>We, the undersigned, entrusted by our comrades in Guangdong, have come to meet and confer with the intentions of resolving various difficult issues facing the Party and the nation, and of jointly facing the national crisis. We are grateful for your teachings and encouragement to correct past mistakes, and we sincerely hope that such unfortunate disputes will not occur again in the future. This is precisely what we have been longing for. Regarding the realization of these hopes, we have proposed the following measures: (1) To jointly face the national crisis, we must first strive for unified action in foreign affairs. (2) Regarding the various difficult issues facing the Party and the nation, we propose that you send several representatives to Shanghai to discuss solutions in detail with us. After reaching mutual agreement, we will convene a formal meeting to decide on implementation. (3) We believe that the fundamental issue for the Party and the nation is to centralize power in the Party and to complete democratic politics according to the procedures stipulated in the Outline of National Reconstruction. This is a fundamental principle, and we hope you will take it into consideration. (4) Regarding Party affairs, we propose to convene the meetings of the First, Second, and Third Central Committees to jointly seek solutions and to generate a sound Fourth National Congress to eliminate past disputes and establish a foundation for the future. (5) For the position of Chairman of the National Government, we propose to emulate the presidential systems of France and Germany and appoint a comrade of high age and virtue. Active military personnel should not be elected. (6) We propose to abolish the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force and establish a separate military organization, the details of which will be determined separately. (7) The joint telegram proposed in Guangdong the other day is intended to bring an end to past disputes and is by no means a mutual abandonment of responsibility. Therefore, the responsibilities that each party should bear before the meeting is decided should be shouldered as usual. As for how to serve the Party and the nation in the future, we will abide by the decisions of the meeting.</p>
<p>The above points are certainly not exhaustive of all the issues to be decided today, but we have first listed the major ones, and the rest can be raised during the discussion. As for the restoration of freedom for comrades Ju Juesheng and Fang Shuping, and the exemption of postal and telegraphic news from censorship, so that freedom of expression can be freely expressed, we have already received your approval and hope that you will implement them as soon as possible.</p>
<p>We entrust Mr. Cai Jiemin and Mr. Zhang Puquan to convey everything on our behalf. We sincerely hope for your consideration and acceptance. With utmost respect,</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei, Sun Ke, Wu Chaoshu, Zou Lu, Li Wenfan, Chen Youren,</p>
<p>Twenty-second day.</p>
<p>Chiang Kai-shek's Reply to Guangdong Representatives</p>
<p>Respectful greetings to Mr. Jingwei, Mr. Zhesheng, Mr. Tiyun, Mr. Junpei, Mr. Haibin, and Mr. Youren,</p>
<p>Mr. Jiemin and Mr. Puquan have come to Beijing and brought your respectful letter, which I have received with pleasure. The most important task at present is to express a united spirit towards foreign affairs in action so that international audiences can be shifted, and national expectations can be comforted. Saving the country and the Party is the most urgent task. As for the fundamental issues of the Party and the nation, how to carefully consider what is best and thereby establish a good foundation for the future without sowing the seeds of future ills, these are internal matters that can be frankly discussed. This intention has already been explained in detail during our meeting in Shanghai.</p>
<p>For the sake of facilitating meetings and discussions with you in Shanghai, I have already asked Comrades Shizeng, Jingjiang, Puquan, Jiemin, and Zhenru to make contact in the vicinity, and I have also asked Mr. Zhantang to deliberate together. I sincerely hope that you will consider the difficulties facing the nation and promptly consult with Mr. Shizeng and the other gentlemen, and then come to Beijing immediately to jointly face the national crisis. Please also send a telegram to indicate your travel dates to appease the hopes of the people. As for myself and the other comrades in Beijing, we originally intended to go to Shanghai to meet and confer again and to welcome your esteemed presence, but the urgency of foreign affairs makes it impossible to leave lightly. The unsaid is entrusted to Gentlemen Pu and Jie to convey on my behalf. I hope for your consideration. Please also convey my best wishes to Mr. Zhantang.</p>
<p>I hereby send my reply and respectfully wish you well.</p>
<p>Chiang Zhongzheng,</p>
<p>Twenty-fourth day.</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei on the Provisional Constitution</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Jingwei expressed his opinions on the issue of the Provisional Constitution yesterday, saying: (1) I have always advocated that there should be a Provisional Constitution during the period of political tutelage. The relationship between the government and the people, and the relationship between the central government and local governments, should all be clearly stipulated in the Provisional Constitution. (2) This Provisional Constitution should be in written form so that people can easily understand and implement it. (3) All the articles listed in the Outline of National Reconstruction are the fundamental principles of the Provisional Constitution. The Provisional Constitution should be based on the Outline of National Reconstruction to formulate detailed articles to achieve precision and completeness. (4) During the period of political tutelage, civil rights should increase day by day in time and expand place by place in space. Only in this way can we reach the constitutional government period. The Provisional Constitution should pay attention to this point. This is the special characteristic of the Provisional Constitution and the difference between the Provisional Constitution and the Constitution. The purpose of the Constitution is to define civil rights, while the purpose of the Provisional Constitution is to cultivate civil rights, so that they can develop and grow until they mature.</p>
<p>Sun Ke Advocates Political Democratization</p>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter visited Guangdong Committee Member Sun Zhesheng at his Shanghai residence and inquired about solutions to the current situation. He candidly declared his political views. The following is a record of his answers:</p>
<p>(Question) What are your opinions on fundamentally resolving the current situation?</p>
<p>(Answer) The Extraordinary Conference issued a telegram from Mabian on the sixth of this month, outlining the following concrete proposals for resolving the current situation. First, Japan's use of military force to seize Northeast China not only infringes upon our country's territorial sovereignty but also violates the League of Nations Covenant and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. After the establishment of a unified national government, it should immediately, based on justice and international integrity, demand that the signatory countries of the League of Nations and the Kellogg-Briand Pact impose appropriate sanctions on Japan's improper actions so that violence yields to justice. Japan's instigation of independence in Northeast China to achieve its annexation plan must be eliminated. Special attention must be paid to ensuring that Northeast China is in name and in fact the territory of the Republic of China. As for the fundamental solution, it lies in leading the people of the whole country to do their utmost to engage in self-defense and avenge our shame. The Prussia conquered by Napoleon I, the France after the Franco-Prussian War, and the Germany after the European War all had the right to perish, but they were able to endure hardship and become independent. How can our people not encourage themselves in this way? It must be understood that public morale is important, but public strength is even more important. Efforts must be made to enrich all aspects of politics, economy, military affairs, and culture. There is no other way to save the country. Second, to cultivate public strength, the first step is to support civil rights. The President of our Party stipulated the Outline of National Reconstruction, which calls for attention to training the people during the period of political tutelage, enabling them to exercise political power, complete local self-government, and participate in central government affairs. As for the private rights of the people, such as freedom of person, residence, business, speech, publication, and assembly, they must be guaranteed by law. The growth of civil rights is the success of political tutelage; the opposite is failure. Therefore, the greatest task after the establishment of a unified national government is to fulfill the President's last wishes and cultivate democratic forces as the foundation for nation-building. At the same time, attention should be paid to the openness of public affairs so that the dark forces of individual dictatorship cannot be established. Third, the root cause of the division and chaos of the past twenty years has been the use of force to coerce politics. Therefore, the prerequisite for democratic politics is to make the military subject to the control of politics. The methods are: (1) Abolish the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. (2) Establish military districts. The division of military districts does not have to be the same as the division of administrative regions. (3) Independent military expenditures should eliminate the bad habit of individuals controlling the military and military officers controlling military pay. (4) National defense should be unified under the central government, and security should belong to the local governments. The national army should bear these two major tasks. As for politics, it must not be interfered with in any way. Whether a unified national government can realize democratic politics depends on its ability to control the military with political force. Fourth, military tyranny and financial chaos are mutually dependent. Military tyranny leads to insatiable demands, not only seizing financial institutions but also entrusting the seized financial institutions to the state of fundraising and being unable to extricate themselves. Financial plans cannot be discussed, and corruption ensues. Therefore, to reorganize finances, the first step is to make the military forces subject to political control, and the second is for the government and the people to cooperate. The people should know that the use of finances is appropriate and that the officials in charge of financial administration are honest and upright. Only then can they develop a sense of public service and righteousness, and the government can rely on the power of the people to accomplish things. As for the methods of cooperation between the government and the people, fundamentally, it lies in the people's representative body to exercise the power of budget and final accounts, but the immediate need is for the government and the people to jointly establish a National Financial Reorganization Committee to thoroughly reorganize the current chaotic financial situation. I personally believe that all modern countries must have a minimum level of political, economic, and social organization. If even this minimum level of organization is not complete, it will not have the ability to exist and stand on its own in the world and cannot be called a country. Therefore, foreigners say that the two words "China" are only a geographical term. Japan's occupation of Dong Province by force is like entering an unmanned territory. We should deeply recognize this lesson and quickly catch up and build the country. The Kuomintang, with the responsibility of building the country, has failed in the past and bears a deep debt to the people. The declaration of the Extraordinary Conference is intended to painfully correct past mistakes and meet the requirements of the serious situation, and to quickly establish the various organizations that a country must have. However, if the government is not reformed, all economic and social undertakings will be hindered and destroyed, let alone progress. The biggest problem in politics in the past was that the military controlled politics. The biggest demand in the future is to promote the democratization of politics.</p>
<p>(Question) What are your opinions on promoting the democratization of politics?</p>
<p>(Answer) The Kuomintang's greatest responsibility during the period of political tutelage is to establish civil rights; otherwise, it is only dictatorship, not political tutelage. In the future, in addition to following the Outline of National Reconstruction and completing county autonomy as soon as possible, this Party should also learn from past failures and meet the needs of the times by convening National Political Participation Conferences every year so that the people have a complete and full political participation mechanism. Among the current five-yuan system, the Legislative Yuan and the Control Yuan should be democratized as quickly as possible in a gradual manner. The method is to have a portion of the members of the Legislative Yuan and the Control Yuan elected by the National Political Participation Conference. The elected members should account for half of the total number. This should be increased year by year in the future.</p>
<p>(Question) What are your opinions on the implementation of the third item advocated by the Mabian telegram of the Extraordinary Conference, that the military should be absolutely subject to political control, and the fourth item, that finances should be open and cooperate with the people?</p>
<p>(Answer) This is the key to getting rid of the old and establishing the new. There is a way out if it can be done, otherwise there is only a dead end. The Extraordinary Conference's advocacy of abolishing the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, establishing military districts, and independent military expenditures, I think everyone already knows. Over the years, the Kuomintang, due to military actions and temporary needs, has had the Commander-in-Chief directly order various large and small institutions, thus forming a government outside the government. As the ancients said, it has been accumulating for a long time, and it is not the fault of one person or the fault of all the people in the world. But today, we can only shed tears and talk about it, and jointly seek to get rid of the old and establish the new, and go from life to death. In short, it is the duty of the military to defend the country, and after this lesson, it is even more a duty that cannot be shirked. As for the financial aspect, it must also be thoroughly reformed. The necessary elements of a modern country are a definite budget and financial openness. At a time when the people are poor, finances are exhausted, and natural disasters and foreign troubles are intertwined, there is no way to reverse the economic bankruptcy except by saving money and cultivating vitality. At a time when the country is in trouble and everything is waiting to be done, there is no way to save the country that is about to perish except by turning the country's useless soldiers to useful purposes and jointly seeking construction. If the Legislative Yuan and the Control Yuan have elected members, then the Party already has a concrete way to cooperate with the people in the formulation of the budget and the legislative and supervisory powers of finance. In addition, a Finance Committee should be established, composed of representatives from the government, the banking industry, and the business community, as well as experts with (A) knowledge and (B) experience. The number of government personnel should not exceed one-fifth of the total. The government should grant the committee special powers to reorganize finances, implement budgets, supervise expenditures, audit reports, and require people to disclose accounts. This will enable central finances to be absolutely open. Once finances are on the right track, all politics can follow suit.</p>
<p>Wu Chaoshu on Diplomacy</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, a reporter from the New Sound Society visited Mr. Wu Chaoshu and inquired about his opinions on the establishment of a unified diplomatic committee and the Nanjing side's invitation to Guangdong representatives to attend the special diplomatic committee. Mr. Wu answered as follows: (1) The establishment of a unified diplomatic committee: According to the answer, there are difficulties in the establishment of the committee. Whether the establishment of the committee is based on the Guangdong government or the Nanjing government. If it is based on one side alone, it cannot be called unified diplomacy. If a unified diplomatic committee is established without any basis, it will not have any effect and will be equivalent to a dummy and will not help. It is not necessary to do this. Second, in terms of the relationship between functions and powers, if the committee is established, whether its functions and powers can be implemented or whether it is only a decorative body for discussing diplomacy is also worth considering and researching. However, in my opinion, a unified diplomatic committee should be organized, and it is more appropriate to organize it by the peace conference representatives from both Guangdong and Nanjing. After its establishment, a diplomatic policy should be decided and contributed to the diplomatic authorities for implementation. At the same time, various diplomatic issues should also be decided by the committee and handed over to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for implementation. The reporter then asked whether the Guangdong representatives had drafted a diplomatic policy and whether this policy would be used as a principle or only for reference in future diplomatic discussions. He replied that it would only be for reference. (2) The Nanjing side's invitation to Guangdong representatives to attend the special diplomatic committee: According to the answer, the special diplomatic committee organized by the Nanjing government has more than 20 talented people. Even if the Guangdong representatives send one or two to attend, it will not be important, and because the peace conference is about to begin, there is no need to attend.</p>
<h3>Opinions of Professors from Various Universities in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Preparing for War Against Japan</p>
<p>Organizing a National Defense Government</p>
<p>Respecting the Rights of the People</p>
<p>This time, the Central Committee members from Ningbo and Guangdong are holding a peaceful unification conference, which is of great importance to the overall situation of our country. Over two hundred professors from various universities in Shanghai have jointly sent a letter to all the members of the conference, stating their opinions. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>To all members of the Peaceful Unification Conference,</p>
<p>With respect, since the establishment of the National Government, construction has been unheard of, and destruction has intensified. Red flames engulf the sky, and disaster-stricken people are everywhere. The country has no peaceful years, and the people have no means of livelihood. In terms of military affairs, every time violent enemies invade, the revolutionary army bows its head and submits, allowing themselves to be slaughtered. They exhibit the utmost humility, while the senior members of the party and state, when discussing politics, disagree even slightly, drawing swords and pulling bows, with no tolerance whatsoever. In terms of diplomacy, the calm attitude of the people is almost unheard, and the achievements of the authorities in negotiations have never been seen even in the slightest. All the tragic disasters and strange humiliations that were unseen and unheard of during the autocratic era of the Qing Dynasty, the era of the Hongxian pseudo-government, and the era of warlord separatism have become commonplace during the era of the National Revolutionary Government. Now, the Northeast has fallen, and the fate of the country is hanging by a thread. Even ordinary people know to work together and vow to face the national crisis. Foreigners even express deep sympathy and advocate for justice. However, our party and state elites, all followers of the Premier, sharing the Three Principles of the People, have what kind of deep-seated hatred, irreconcilable differences, or what kind of old grudges that cannot be abandoned? They must wait for the people to repeatedly call for peace and for mediators to negotiate the terms, starting one month after the violent Japanese invasion. Leisurely and unhurriedly, they slowly arrive to hold a conference, as if they will not stop their internal strife until the day the country is truly destroyed. The people of the whole country cannot help but sigh for you, and regard this conference as giving you a final opportunity to change your ways and start anew. They especially hope that you can make good use of this opportunity and not let the people of the country be disappointed in the end. You should know that at this time of extreme national and ethnic crisis, the only task at hand is to exhaust your loyalty and wisdom, open your hearts and show your sincerity, and jointly strive for the goal of saving the country and resisting the enemy. Do not involve yourselves in any past personal issues or engage in any more pointless disputes. You are all pillars of the party and the country. Who has not been involved in politics? Who should not bear responsibility for misleading the party and the country? From now on, only through thorough awareness, sincere unity, and unanimous opposition to external forces can you redeem your past mistakes and restore the faith of the people. Today's conference should not only seek compromise within the party, hoping that everyone can get what they want. It should also gather wisdom and adopt the public opinion of the people to seek the best possible solutions and effective plans to address both the symptoms and the root causes.</p>
<p>We, as teachers</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>in public and private universities in this city, mourn the imminent demise of the country and feel that silence is unbearable. We dare to invoke the principle that every person has a responsibility and offer a few humble suggestions within our limited understanding. We hope you will consider them: (1) We must insist on the unconditional withdrawal of Japanese troops and reserve the conditions for compensation and apology. We must not make any concessions. If the violent Japanese stubbornly persist, we must make a final stand, even at the cost of any sacrifice. (2) We must concentrate the talents of the whole country and organize a national defense government. The country does not have an abundance of talent, and not all of it belongs to one party. We must urgently extend invitations based on the common goal of resisting the enemy, making sure that everyone can use their strengths and that no talent is left unused. We must not arbitrarily divide the world, causing talented and knowledgeable individuals to feel helpless. (3) We must respect the rights of the people. The people are the masters of the country. Since the rule of the party, the rights of the masters have been almost completely deprived. All the freedoms that should be enjoyed under the law have no guarantee. True public opinion is suppressed and silenced, and reactionary forces seize the opportunity to grow in the dark. Those with insight are deeply saddened. Now, if we want to seek the promotion of righteousness and the expression of public opinion, we must first respect the inherent rights of the people. The above points are all urgent national priorities, and we hope that you will adopt them as much as possible. As for fundamental solutions, they are not limited to one aspect. We will offer our humble contributions at a later date. We have spoken urgently, and we hope you will understand. We wish you all the best.</p>

<h3>Important Declaration from the Municipal Federation</h3>
<p>Domestically, Party Affairs Should Be Improved and Officialdom Purified</p>
<p>Externally, a Policy Towards Japan Should be Decided as Soon as Possible</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special District Citizens' Federation issued an important declaration on the current situation yesterday, based on the resolution of the joint meeting of representatives. It stated that our country has suffered from the scourge of war for a long time. Since the revolution, internal strife has been frequent, rising and falling, endlessly recurring. The reason for this lies in the warlords' clinging</p>
<p>to the dream of ruling by force and creating an autocratic system of governance. The late Premier clearly understood the root cause of the problem and advocated for the National Revolution. He painstakingly and patiently guided the people, using the Three Principles of the People as the center, so that the people's groups would have a consistent understanding of the country and the nation. Therefore, since the reorganization of party affairs in the thirteenth year, our people have a unified will and a unified thought, all based on this. Although the late Premier unfortunately passed away prematurely, his great spirit clearly showed us the way and has not been extinguished. Thus, the Guangzhou oath to launch the Northern Expedition was followed by the whole country. In a short time, the warlords were overthrown, and China was unified. From this, it can be seen that the psychology of the people is to love peace and hate war. This is not something that started today. Unfortunately, in recent years, various parties have resorted to military force due to differences in political views. This phenomenon is a misfortune for the country and the nation, and it is undeniable that the revolution has not been thorough. Now, the diplomacy is urgent, and the country is in a deep crisis. The violent Japanese are rampant and continue to intensify their aggression. At this critical moment when the country is on the verge of collapse, if we do not work together, we will inevitably plunge the country and the nation into a situation of eternal destruction due to personal conflicts. Our party and state leaders, sharing the difficulties of the times and deeply understanding the suffering of the people, have resolutely abandoned all prejudices and are working together. This is truly the key to the survival of our Chinese nation. We are all eagerly hoping and optimistically watching its success. This association, in accordance with the people's desire for governance, hopes to implement the late Premier's legacy of peaceful salvation and sincerely hopes that the party and state leaders will not focus on personal gain or loss when discussing national affairs. They should have a common goal for the survival of the Chinese nation. Otherwise, they will be without a national or ethnic concept, willingly become enemies of the people, and abandon themselves. What is there to take? Therefore, this association has the following proposals based on the resolution of the representative conference: Domestically, party affairs should be improved, officialdom purified, talent concentrated, and efforts made in construction to achieve the late Premier's principle of making the best use of talent and land, and to comply with the political program of implementing sovereignty in the hands of the people. Externally, a policy towards Japan should be decided as soon as possible to restore the status of our nation and prevent the Chinese nation, which has stood for thousands of years, from collapsing at the hands of the Japanese. In short, defending against external aggression and maintaining internal stability are the most important issues at present and are related to the survival of the country. Anyone who willingly destroys this is tantamount to causing our four hundred million people to perish under foreign rule. The suffering of Korea and Vietnam will not only affect us but will also affect our descendants forever. How can we bear to say it? Time is pressing, and we cannot choose our words carefully. This is a declaration, and we hope you will consider it.</p>

<h3>The Anti-Drug and Anti-Japanese Corps is Working Actively</h3>
<p>Focusing on Foreign and Pictorial Propaganda</p>
<p>Encouragement from American Celebrities Via Telegram</p>
<p>The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Corps of the Chinese National Anti-Drug Association has been working hard on publicity in recent days. The English report on Japan's poisoning of China, which they compiled, has been published and is now being sent to important groups and social leaders in Europe and the United States. In addition, the Anti-Japanese new posters of the Propaganda Section of the association have also been printed and will be published soon. Anyone who enthusiastically joins in the printing will be charged fifteen yuan per thousand copies. Also, the association received a telegram from Mrs. Fukede, a leading American anti-drug activist, yesterday:</p>
<p>To the Director-General of the Chinese National Anti-Drug Association, Huang Jiawei, for public review by all groups:</p>
<p>The news of the Japanese violating the Kellogg-Briand Pact and forcibly occupying the Northeast has been shocking. Public opinion here expresses deep sympathy for the difficult situation your country is in. We deeply hope that your people will maintain a steadfast attitude and persevere in the movement to boycott Japanese goods. It must not be relaxed, and war with the enemy must not be initiated. The effectiveness of your country's boycott of Japanese goods far exceeds the combat power of three million troops. If you can persevere to the end, it will be more than enough to control the enemy's life.</p>
<p>It is reported that the association has sent a telegram to thank her for her kindness and has requested that she vigorously publicize the crimes of the violent Japanese in order to arouse just public opinion. It is said that Mrs. Fukede is a famous American writer whose views are sufficient to represent the American intellectual community. Her book "The Road to Ruin," also known as "The Black Sea Fruit Report," has been translated into Chinese by the Chinese National Anti-Drug Association and will be published soon.</p>

<h3>Anti-Japanese Work in All Sectors</h3>
<p>The Transportation Industry Swears to Refuse to Transport Japanese Goods</p>
<p>The transportation industry association of this port had previously resolved in a meeting to unanimously refuse to transport Japanese goods. In order to thoroughly boycott them, the association convened the inspection team members yesterday to hold an oath ceremony, and each signed the oath to show their determination. At that time, the participants successively gave speeches, encouraging each other, and then shouted various slogans and dispersed.</p>
<h3>The Magnificent Undertaking of Foreign Firm Employees Hiking to Promote Awareness</h3>
<p>Last Sunday, employees of foreign firms in this port held a rural anti-Japanese national salvation propaganda event. Those who joined included Xie Yunting, Zhu Jingwen, Xie Youqian, Shu Wenxing, Zhang Jinrong from Kongshi Foreign Firm, and Cao Yinyun, Shao Xiyan, and Shen Yinhe from Benehmen Foreign Firm, totaling eight people. They carried various anti-Japanese national salvation slogans and pictures to various villages and towns in the four rural areas of Nanxiang, including Zhujia Village, Qijia Bridge, Yangliu Bridge, Fengjia Bang, Jiwang Temple, and other villages such as Qujia Zhuang, Jiajing and Huacao. Wherever they went, the villagers flocked to listen. The above-mentioned gentlemen took turns speaking about the tragic case of the Northeast and the shortcuts that should be taken for anti-Japanese national salvation. The speeches were tragic and concise, and the listeners were moved with righteous indignation and voluntarily monitored each other to forever boycott Japanese goods. Some even shouted loudly that they were willing to take up their carrying poles and hoes and fight to the death with those dwarves. The above-mentioned villages and towns through which the propaganda team passed all had representatives who volunteered to serve as liaison representatives to facilitate future communication on anti-Japanese national salvation work. It can be seen that the effectiveness of rural propaganda is twice the result with half the effort and is greater than any propaganda. We hope that all sectors will rise up and strive to emulate it.</p>
<p>The YMCA Holds a Scheduled Speech</p>
<p>The Shanghai YMCA has launched a college student Northeast issue speech contest entitled "How to Solve the Northeast Issue." It is scheduled to be held at the YMCA at 2:00 PM on November 21st.

<h3>The Lawyers' Association's Volunteer Army and Propaganda</h3>
<p>In addition to the dozens of lawyers who have volunteered to sign up for the National Salvation Corps organized by the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of the Shanghai Lawyers' Association, including Chen Qun, Yu Zhong, and Luo, more than 20 lawyers, including Yang Li, Yang Yuan, Hu Xunlian, Yu Congdao, Wang Yuanhou, Shen Zengkuan, Lu Huimin, Chen Kongcheng, and Zheng Wentong, joined yesterday. Therefore, the group decided to budget for uniforms and begin training, and to hire lawyers familiar with military science as coaches to actively prepare for all the work to be carried out. The committee members of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Propaganda Group made a suggestion that since the association has more than 700 lawyers, if each person could draft a propaganda and speech manuscript, the proposal was approved and the meeting notified all members to proceed according to the resolution and requested that each committee member submit a draft lecture and propaganda manuscript within one week to the association for review, summary and publication.</p>
<h3>The Italian Chamber of Commerce Expresses Sympathy for the Rejection of Japan</h3>
<p>Italian Goods Will No Longer be Loaded on Japanese Ships</p>
<p>The Italian Far East Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating:</p>
<p>We have received your letter, indicating that goods from various countries loaded on Japanese ships or docked at Japanese wharves will inevitably encounter difficulties, and that Japanese goods are fraudulently labeled as products of other countries. We have received this and held a special meeting of various Italian merchants and import merchants in this city on October 20th. The merchants who attended the meeting were very concerned about this matter, and all the points in your letter have been carefully noted. We hereby reply for your information.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ships in China Have No Business</h3>
<p>Two Hundred Ships are Affected</p>
<p>With the Japanese occupation of our Northeast, and the boycott sparked in various ports, Japanese ships in China, in the Yangtze River, the northern and southern oceans, and other ports, have recently stopped their voyages due to a lack of cargo and passengers. There are fifteen ships in the Yangtze River, and fourteen ships that have not stopped but have no business. In North China and the South China Sea, the Qianshan Maru, Beiyang Maru, Qinping Maru, Taichang Maru, Jilin Maru, Tianyou Maru, Guangdong Maru, etc., totaling 74,500 tons, have stopped operations. In addition to those that are still sailing, but are running empty, there are still over one hundred ships. Statistics show that about two hundred Japanese ships, accounting for 400,000 tons, have been affected by the boycott and have no business to speak of.</p>
<p>Japanese Coal Carriers Terminate Leases</p>
<p>Since this port has refused to use Japanese coal, Fushun coal has not arrived in Shanghai. The coal-carrying ships of Mitsui Daqi and others had stopped loading earlier. To prevent misunderstandings by the Chinese and affect its coal sales business in China, the company that rented the Japanese coal-carrying ships has completely terminated the leases and switched to using Chinese ships for transportation. As a result, the rental fees for Chinese ships have also soared. What used to be 7,000 yuan per month now costs up to 12,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Japanese Merchants Change Docks</p>
<p>Japanese spinning mills in Shanghai have ordered a large quantity of cotton from the United States, which is currently being shipped. Some of the American cotton purchased by Japanese merchants was originally scheduled to be unloaded at the North Bund of the China Merchants Bureau. Yesterday, the Japanese yarn mills notified the shipping companies carrying the goods to change the docking location to foreign wharves to avoid accidents. From today onwards, Japanese merchants' incoming goods will generally not be picked up at Chinese wharves.</p>
<h3>The Preparatory Committee for Cotton Yarn Mills is Preparing to Build a Domestic Goods Sizing Yarn Mill</h3>
<p>The Capital is Fixed at 100,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The Promoters' Meeting is Called</p>
<p>Since the Preparatory Committee for Cotton Yarn Mills was approved by the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association to use the received yarn mill shares to establish a sizing yarn mill to meet urgent needs, progress has been quite diligent. Now, a preparatory meeting has been convened to discuss the work progress, and it has been decided that the capital will be 100,000 yuan, which will be raised by the promoters separately. Each share is 1,000 taels. However, most of the original promoters of the cotton yarn mill did not attend the meeting on that day. Therefore, the preparatory committee sent another letter yesterday urging them to come to the meeting within a time limit to sign and subscribe for shares. The original letter stated:</p>
<p>To Whom It May Concern:</p>
<p>(Omitted above) The executive committee of our association and the promoters of the cotton yarn mill previously convened a joint meeting and resolved to convene a promoters' meeting within two weeks. We have learned that you, sir, are also one of the promoters of the cotton yarn mill, but you did not attend the meeting on that day to sign your name. Therefore, we are sending you this special letter and hope that you will uphold your original intention of serving society and come to the meeting to sign your name and subscribe for 1,000 yuan in shares before November 6th to be notified of attending the promoters' meeting. We hope you will take note. (Omitted below)</p>

<h3>Nanhua Starts Sailing and Beiyang Increases Freight Rates</h3>
<p>Nanhua Starts to Deploy Ships</p>
<p>With the peaceful unification between the North and the South, Guangdong has lifted the ban on navigation. Ships heading to Shantou and Guangdong have no obstacles upon import. Nanzhi Steamship of Shanghai has stopped the Nanhua route since May, which has been half a year so far. Since the news of the cancellation of the ban arrived in Shanghai, Shantou and Guangdong merchants in this port have requested the China Merchants Bureau and other companies to dispatch ships to transport the accumulated goods from various ports. China Merchants originally had four ships traveling to and from Shanghai and Guangdong, but due to the lack of ships that can be mobilized, they had to request the headquarters to first release the Yuan'an ship back to Shanghai. The ship can arrive in Shanghai today, and the Shanghai-Shantou-Guangdong route will be officially launched tomorrow. This has been announced to the Hakka people. Since the suspension of navigation in May, this is the first ship of the Chinese merchant fleet to resume the Nanhua route.</p>
<p>Beiyang Increases Freight Rates</p>
<p>Recently, goods shipped from Shanghai to Yantai and Tianjin have been extremely congested. Yesterday, British merchants Taikoo and Jardine Matheson invited various shipping companies such as the China Merchants Bureau to a meeting to implement a price increase for the freight of goods exported to Beiyang, starting from today. The prices for yarn, cotton, and flour were first agreed upon. The price of cotton cloth was increased from 14.5 taels per ton to 16.5 taels. The price of cotton was increased from 1.4 taels per piece to 1.7 taels. The price of flour was increased from 6 cents per package to 20 cents.

<h3>After the Strike of the Staff and Workers of the China Bookstore</h3>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau Orders Normal Work</p>
<p>After the general strike of all staff and workers of the China Bookstore main factory and distribution center in this city, yesterday, the Social Affairs Bureau strictly ordered them to resume work as usual. The authorities of the British and French Concessions have sent personnel to investigate. The details of the situation are as follows:</p>
<p>Business Interrupted: After the general strike of all staff and workers, yesterday, the staff of the Four Horses Road distribution center politely refused customers, and business was completely interrupted. Although the main factory opened as usual, all staff and workers continued the strike. The China Bookstore branch office of the publishing industry union convened an emergency joint meeting of group leaders and executives at 8:00 p.m. yesterday to discuss the case of the management's refusal to reinstate worker Li Hongbin and the staff's and workers' autonomous strike, in order to decide on a course of action.</p>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau ordered the publishing industry union to send Yang Youren, Wan Pusheng, and Wang Yongliang, and the China Bookstore branch office to send Huang Zhuting and He Jiexian, to the Social Affairs Bureau at 1:00 p.m. yesterday to report on the process of the staff and workers' autonomous strike. The Social Affairs Bureau issued an order to the China Bookstore and the Municipal Publishing Industry Union in the afternoon, ordering all staff and workers to resume work as usual from today. The management must not refuse to reinstate worker Li Hongbin.</p>
<p>Authorities Investigate: The Political Department of the Public Concession's Bureau of Public Works sent Li Haifeng to the China Bookstore on the morning of the same day to investigate the truth of the staff and workers' strike. The Political Department of the French Bureau of Public Works also sent Li Yifang to investigate. It is reported that Lu Feibaihong, the general manager of the China Bookstore, has submitted a request to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau for handling in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>Bureau Submits a Document: The China Bookstore submitted a document to the Social Affairs Bureau stating, "Reporting a case of coercion and strike by some workers: At 3:50 p.m. on the 24th, no machinery sound was heard from the company's printing factory. At 4:00 p.m., the sound of machinery was heard again. According to reports, some people ordered a strike, and some people refused to strike, almost leading to conflict. Afterward, some departments continued to work. It happened to be Saturday, so we did not pay attention. Yesterday, the main store worked overtime on Saturday, and some of the counter staff went on strike. Some of the accounting department on the second floor and some of the bookstore staff on the fourth floor went on strike. Today, the editorial office and the general office are working as usual. The printing factory and the main store are still the same as the previous two days. When asked why they were striking, some said that the union ordered it, and some said that if they did not strike, they would be threatened and insulted. Yesterday, some of the counter staff at the main store even asked for leave, declaring that they were leaving Shanghai. The company will hold a board meeting tomorrow. Before the board of directors decides on a solution, the administrator can only pay attention to order. This report is hereby submitted for your examination and record." (omission below)</p>

<h3>Serious Case of Detective Conspiring to Kill for Money</h3>
<p>Didn't Return a Thousand Yuan Debt...Falsely Accused of Kidnapping</p>
<p>Several Times Subjected to Electric Shock...Autopsy Confirmed Death from Lung Disease</p>
<p>Wife Sues After Husband's Death...Requests Justice</p>
<p>If Such a Thing Exists...The Law Cannot Forgive It</p>
<p>The General Inspectorate of the General Patrol Station, while investigating Chinese and foreign detectives, successively arrested seven kidnappers, including Wang Daming, Chen San, and Chen Zhu, etc., on Guangdong Road and Oujia Road, etc., on September 28 of this year. Wang and Chen then confessed that Lu Qingcai from Jiangbei was also an accomplice, so Lu was arrested on a rickshaw at the intersection of Edward Road and Longmen Road and sent to the First Special District Local Court for interrogation and detention. However, Lu Qingcai suffered from lung disease after being arrested and was sent to the Bureau of Public Works Hospital for treatment by the patrol station, but the treatment was ineffective, and he died at 6:00 p.m. on October 14. The body was examined by the prosecutor of the Special Court on the 15th and autopsied on the 16th. The result was a diagnosis of death from lung disease. However, the wife of the deceased Lu Qingcai, Lu Yin, claimed that her husband was killed for money by Zhou Honglin, a Chinese detective number 129 (namely Ji Lihong), and hired lawyer Dan Yuhua to file a complaint against Detective Zhou in the Special Court. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Tingqi presided over the second criminal court to summon the defendant, who also hired lawyer Ding Rong to appear in court to defend him. The plaintiff, Lu Yin, submitted a statement claiming that she was 25 years old, from Jiangbei, and lived at No. 42, One Hundred Rooms, North Bund. Lu Qingcai was my husband, 46 years old. Defendant Ji Lihong was from the same hometown and a friend. Last November, because of the opening of a store, he borrowed money from my husband. At that time, he borrowed 1,000 yuan with someone serving as guarantor. On the morning of the 28th of last month, at about 8:00 a.m., Detective Ji instructed my husband to go and collect the money. As soon as he arrived, he was put in a car and taken to the General Patrol Station, accused of kidnapping, and immediately detained. All his receipts were taken away. At that time, I did not know. It was not until October 13 that I heard the news and rushed to the patrol station to visit. My husband had already been sent to the Bureau of Public Works Hospital. I immediately went to the hospital, and my husband told me that he had been falsely accused of being a kidnapper by Ji, who wanted to avoid paying his debt, and that he had been subjected to electric shock three times, causing burning pain in his chest. He feared that he had no hope of survival and told me to go home quickly and seek justice on his behalf. He spoke in a weak and low voice. The next day, I went to visit him again, but my husband had already died. Then I went to the morgue. After the judge's autopsy, I claimed the body, etc. Judge Wu then asked Lu Yin, "What evidence do you have for what your husband said?" She replied, "My husband told me personally." He asked, "What day?" She replied, "October 13, in the hospital." He asked, "How many people went with you at that time?" She replied, "I went with my sister, Lu Su (i.e., Lu Qingcai's senior wife)." He asked, "Your husband's death has been confirmed to be from lung disease. Do you have anything to say?" The woman then presented a photo of four people together, saying, "The second person in the photo wearing the coat is my husband Lu Qingcai. He was strong and healthy and did not have lung disease. How could he have lung disease?" When questioned, the defendant Zhou Honglin stated, "Everything the plaintiff said is unfounded, and I do not know Lu Qingcai. There was no loan. On September 28, according to information, the kidnapper Wang Daming was arrested on the road. Wang confessed that his accomplices, Chen San and his son, were hiding at No. 60 Oujia Road. The Chinese and foreign detectives surrounded the house, but the person was actually next door at No. 62. When he heard the police, he tried to escape and was arrested by us. Chen and Wang confessed that Lu Qingcai was an accomplice and that they kidnapped a meat ticket from Hong Fa Ji who was selling soil, who had recently come to Shanghai from elsewhere. They kidnapped him on Edward Road and hid him at No. 3 Ximen Lane, Ximen Road. I (Chen claimed) was responsible for watching the ticket, but recently I have been resting because of eye pain." The Chinese and foreign detectives went to the French Concession to investigate, and on the way, they arrested Lu Qingcai on Edward Road and took him to the general investigation office upstairs at the General Patrol Station. He was not inspected. In the afternoon, because it was discovered that the kidnapping case Lu had committed was in the jurisdiction of the Laozha Patrol Station, Chen was sent to the Laozha Patrol Station, etc. Witness Chen Zhu stated, "Chen San and his son are my husband. On August 17, I was arrested at the same time as my husband for being accused of being a kidnapper and taken to the General Patrol Station. At first, my husband and I were detained in the same room, and then I was detained in a separate room with a female guard. At noon, I suddenly heard screams from the next room. Knowing that it was the sound of beatings, I suspected that my husband was being beaten, so I paid close attention. I pretended to want to relieve myself and asked the female detective to guide me. As I walked past the door of the next room, I peeked inside and saw what appeared to be two people naked. Because it was colored glass, I could not see clearly. Shortly after, I saw two people supporting a person who appeared to be an injured criminal walking in the courtyard. I was afraid that the injured person was my husband, so I paid close attention, and then I was relieved because it was not my husband. I do not know if the person was injured by electric shock." Judge Wu then issued the photo presented by the plaintiff in court and ordered her to identify whether there were any injured criminals in it. The woman immediately pointed out the second person in the photo (i.e., Lu Qingcai). The defendant's lawyer requested that witness Shen Shengda be summoned for questioning, because Shen was the kidnapped meat ticket, and he could identify Lu Qingcai as a kidnapper.</p>
<p>Shen Shengda testified in court, "I am from Shanghai and work for the Xinshengji Construction Factory. On September 13, I took my own car from Yile Tea House on Nanjing Road to the door of Xiqingchi on Jiujiang Road. Suddenly, I encountered four bandits who threatened me with guns, forcing the driver to go south on Fujian Road, west into the French Concession, and get out of the car in the wilderness near the Lujiazhai. I entered a room and was guarded by four bandits for about two weeks. Because the kidnappers wanted to harm me, I called for help and escaped. I vaguely remember the faces of the kidnappers. I can still remember the person who was watching the ticket." The court then issued the photo again. After Shen examined it, he said, "There is no ticket watcher in it. However, in the patrol station, I saw a bandit wearing a blue cloth short shirt and pants who had been to the bandit den twice." After Judge Wu verified the testimony, he instructed the defendant to pay a deposit of 5,000 yuan and adjourned the hearing to November 5.</p>
<p>The plaintiff's complaint is recorded below: "A plea for justice and legal investigation for death by torture, and a civil suit for damages. The plaintiff's husband, Lu Qingcai, from Yancheng, resided in Shanghai and worked as a rickshaw puller. Later, he moved to Hangzhou to contract the Shangtianzhu project in Hangzhou. He was honest in business and never did anything wrong. The disaster was caused by his acquaintance with Ji Weihong, a fellow villager, also known as Zhou Honglin, who is now a detective at the General Patrol Station. In December of last year, the plaintiff's husband went from Hangzhou to Shanghai to collect money from Chen Fugeng, who lived in the French Concession, to help with the Shangtianzhu project. Zhou Honglin claimed to the plaintiff's husband that his Hongbintai pawnshop needed money annually and borrowed 1,000 yuan. The plaintiff's husband agreed to lend him 1,000 yuan, and Zhou Honglin made a written note as proof, agreeing to return it this spring. When the due date arrived, he repeatedly demanded it, and an argument arose. He agreed to return it on August 16. When the due date arrived, the plaintiff's husband went from Hangzhou to Shanghai to demand the money. Upon meeting, Zhou Honglin used sweet words to deceive him, saying that the money had been prepared and asked the plaintiff's husband to bring the note the next day at 8 or 9 o'clock to collect it. Unexpectedly, Zhou Honglin had a vicious heart and falsely accused the plaintiff's husband of theft when he brought the note to collect the money, took him to the patrol station, and destroyed the note. The plaintiff's husband was honest in business and had no case to confess to. Zhou Honglin tortured the plaintiff's husband. Chen Zhu, the wife of Chen Sanwen, who heard screams and saw it through the window, can testify. The plaintiff's husband was usually strong and healthy, as evidenced by the photo. After being tortured, he was on the verge of death and sent to the Bureau of Public Works Hospital. When the plaintiff heard the news and went to see him, he was already in critical condition. When asked about the situation, he revealed the circumstances of the electric shock, which Lu Su was also present to witness. He died the next day. The autopsy revealed that his lungs were rotten, which was clearly the result of electric shock. Like this, swallowing money and falsely accusing, killing by torture, is a violation of Articles 133 and 370 of the Criminal Law. A civil suit is attached, requesting Zhou Honglin to repay the loan of 1,000 yuan and compensate for funeral and family support expenses, etc."</p>
<h3>Winner of the Charity Champagne</h3>
<p>The charity champagne ticket for disaster relief was drawn the day before yesterday in Yinxiang Township. On that day, the Chinese Jockey Club specially invited Xu Shiying, Chu Minyi, Liu Zhilu, Wang Yiting, Xu Jiying, Lin Kanghou, Yuan Ludeng, Wu Zhihao, and others to execute the lottery. Huang Jinrong, Wang Xiaolai, Fu Xiaoan, Zhou Wenrui, and others supervised. Zhang Xiaolin and Du Yuesheng announced the results. Tens of thousands of guests were all excited and happy. The grand occasion was unprecedented. When the seventh champagne race was held, more than 10,000 win tickets and 7,000 place tickets were sold. The number of tickets sold broke the record for all previous horse races in Shanghai. The champagne number was shaken out, and to eliminate malpractices, the number of the matching horse was shaken out after the horse race started. The proper method was praised by the Chinese and foreign guests present. It is reported that the winner of the first prize was Mr. Xu of the Fuyuan Foreign Firm, the second prize was jointly won by Zhong Kecheng and more than 20 others from the China Silver Company, and the third prize was sold temporarily at the racecourse and won by Mr. He of the Guangbang Xietaihe.</p>
<h3>Trial Flight of the Northwest Route</h3>
<p>The Northwest Route prepared by the Eurasia Aviation Corporation has taken shape. The reporter of the New Voice News Agency asked Sun Mutang of the company about this yesterday. According to him, the company has sent a Westerner, Schmidt, to Peiping to make plans. Currently, the prerequisite problem for the trial flight is the gasoline used by the aircraft. Because the wilderness in the northwest suburbs does not have a gasoline supply, special personnel are hired to load a large amount of gasoline by camel caravan and transport it to the machine stations to be established in the provinces of Gansu, Henan, and Shaanxi, so that the aircraft can refuel along the way during future trial flights without causing accidents. The trial flight issue can be realized next month.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Detective Dies in the Line of Duty, Autopsy</h3>
<p>Wang Zongmeng Handles Funeral Arrangements, Etc.</p>
<p>The Wife and Concubine of the Bandit Were Interrogated for the First Time Yesterday</p>
<p>Wu Tianbao, a notorious bandit from Fenghua, Zhejiang (previously mistaken for Shaoxing), who repeatedly committed major cases of robbery, murder, and kidnapping in Hangzhou and elsewhere, fled to Shanghai. The Zhejiang Provincial Government's Security Office received information that the bandit Wu was hiding upstairs at No. 1 Beidifang, Beidi'ao Road, French Concession, Shanghai. The Security Office prepared a document and instructed Detective Jiang Zhongyun (previously mistaken for a detective from the Hangzhou County Public Security Bureau) to bring the document and informant Lou Zirui to Shanghai to report to the French Patrol Station for assistance in the arrest. The Patrol Station requested the Second Special Court to issue an arrest warrant. On the morning of the 24th, at 11:00 a.m., the special agency Bao detectives Ni Jinrong and Zhao Chunsheng, along with Wang Jinyu, went to the address. They entered through the back door after knocking, but Wu had already detected them and was waiting with a gun at the staircase. When Detective Jiang and the two detectives, Ni and Zhao, and the detectives reached the halfway point, Wu opened fire to resist arrest. Jiang, who was in front, was shot three times, injuring his throat, penetrating his back, right arm, and right knee. Detective Ni was shot in the face, and Wang, who was behind, was shot in the left temple. They fell to the ground one after another. Wu immediately escaped through the roof. Detective Zhao immediately charged up with a gun and arrested Wu's wife, Wu Wang, his concubine, Yang, and his wife's younger sister, Wang Xiaohui, and confiscated a live pistol, 13 rounds of ammunition, a magazine, a wooden seal of the 4th Detachment of the 9th Route Army of the Republic of China, and seals of the 4th Detachment Commander's Office, Adjutant Office, and Management Office, as well as ivory seals with Wu's name on them, and an ivory seal of Hao Xianzhang. They were all taken to the Patrol Station. At the same time, the Patrol Station sent the injured to Renji Hospital for treatment. Jiang Zhongyun died of serious injuries at 10:00 a.m. the day before. The Patrol Station transported the body to the Tongren Fuyuan branch hall morgue for an autopsy. The details have been recorded in the newspapers the day before yesterday. It is now learned that the Security Office of the Zhejiang Provincial Government sent special agent Wang Zongmeng to Shanghai to handle the matter. Yesterday morning, the Patrol Station reported to the Second Special Court. Prosecutor Ding Shikui, along with forensic doctors Wei Ligong and Jiang Xuan, and clerk Peng Yi, arrived at 10:00 a.m. to verify the body and take their seats. According to the Bao detectives' report, Judge Ding declared that it was confirmed that Jiang Zhongyun had died from gunshot wounds he sustained while alive. The body was allowed to be collected and coffined by Wang Zongmeng, the official from the Security Office of the Zhejiang Provincial Government. At 11:00 a.m., the Patrol Station escorted Wu Wang and the other two to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. Judge Luo Renji interrogated them. Patrol Station lawyer Fei Xizhen explained the case, saying that Wu Tianbao was a notorious bandit from Zhejiang who was hiding at No. 1 Beidifang. The Zhejiang Provincial Security Office sent Detective Jiang Zhongyun to Shanghai to report to the Patrol Station for assistance in the arrest. After the court issued a warrant and sent detectives to arrest him, Wu opened fire to resist arrest, wounding three people. Wu escaped and only his wife and concubine were captured. The Patrol Station still needs to investigate and requested an adjournment. Bao detective Zhao Chunsheng reported the circumstances of the arrest of Wu and the gunfight. Wang Zongmeng, the official from the Security Office of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, requested that the defendants be transferred for trial. After Judge Luo questioned Wu Wang, Wu Yang, and Wang Xiaohui, he instructed the defendants to be remanded in custody and adjourned the hearing to November 9, and instructed the official to submit a transfer document for review.</p>
<h3>News of Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>The construction of dikes in the disaster areas of northern Jiangsu, the Yangtze River North and the eastern part of the Grand Canal, and the drainage of floodwaters can only be carried out after the breaches in the Grand Canal are repaired and the rivers flowing into the sea in northern Jiangsu are dredged. Mr. Yi Fushi, deputy director of the Disaster Area Work Group of the National Government's Flood Relief Committee and general secretary of the Peiping YMCA, recently went to the area to inspect and has now returned to Shanghai. According to reports, the Jiangsu Provincial authorities are currently carrying out dike repair and river dredging projects. There are a total of twenty-five breaches in the Grand Canal. Five breaches were repaired last week, and two more are expected to be completed by the end of this month. Reeds, silt, and sandbags are all used as dike repair materials. The largest of the river dike breaches are two in Gaoyou, one 2,500 feet wide and one 900 feet wide, and one in Laishen'an, 300 feet wide. The torrents from these breaches are extremely rapid, making the filling work more difficult than elsewhere. It is estimated that repairs will be completed by the end of November. There are many obstacles to the dike repair project, and the diversion of water to the sea is extremely slow. Therefore, the accumulated water in the area for two months has only receded by three and a half feet. Although all construction work can be carried out within the possible scope, progress has been delayed. There are currently two river dredging ships working in Wangjiagang and Zhugang. Other river ports will also be dredged in order. The Jiangsu Provincial Government has decided to allocate 1 million yuan for dike repair and river dredging. As for the work relief plan, it will be implemented after the American wheat arrives. The National Government Flood Relief Committee has set up nineteen disaster relief shelters and one porridge kitchen in Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, Taizhou, Shaobo, Gaoyou, and Xinghua, housing about 20,000 disaster victims. There are eight more shelters and one porridge kitchen to be established. It is estimated that the shelters will have to be maintained until January next year, the earliest, after the floodwaters have completely receded. Yi did not find any disaster victims starving to death in the areas he inspected, but dysentery and malaria are rampant, causing many deaths. Currently, the disaster victims still rely on the remaining grain after the disaster to survive. It is expected that after the remaining grain is exhausted in December, famine will follow. According to Yi's inspection, the area with the heaviest losses of population and property due to the river dike breaches is the area north of Gaoyou City. The breach is 1,500 feet wide, and the entire eastern dike has collapsed. The torrent is like an angry waterfall. The engineering office is currently planning to start repairs from both ends of the breach to control the torrent. Colonel Lin Bai flew here for reconnaissance, paid special attention, and took photos for reference. Xinghua is the most important place in the Grand Canal area, with a population of 80,000, and the disaster is also more serious. It is said that the government and private relief organizations have allocated 10,000 bags of wheat flour and 60,000 yuan in cash for relief. Yi set off from here on this trip to inspect the disaster area. After Yi returned to Shanghai, he recently received a letter from missionary La Ha of Xinghua, stating that the water level east of Xinghua City is usually three feet three inches high. During the flood, the highest level was fourteen feet ten inches (end of August). Recently (October 18), the accumulated water has receded to eleven feet five inches. The villages outside the city are still submerged.</p>
<p>The County Government Continues to Send Old Clothes for Disaster Relief: The Shanghai County Government has successively collected and sent the second batch of old clothes for disaster relief from various county agencies. As of yesterday, there were a total of 1,761 pieces of men's, women's, and children's clothing. County Magistrate Yan believes that the weather is getting colder and the disaster victims urgently need clothes to keep warm, so yesterday he specially sent personnel to transport the clothes by car to the South Central Jiangsu Flood Relief Association for collection and distribution, and ordered various agencies to continue to solicit donations, the more the better.</p>

<h3>Pacific Society Day 5</h3>
<p>Discussion of Labor Issues and Living Standards</p>
<p>The Shen Shi Telegraph Agency reports: The Pacific International Society held its fifth day of the conference yesterday. The round table conference began at 9:10 a.m., divided into four groups to discuss the topic "Labor Issues and Living Standards." The chairman of the first group was Barnes, the chairman of the second group was Salenbo, the chairman of the third group was Aoshihua, and the chairman of the fourth group was Penny Zhi. At 10:50 a.m., the four groups held a joint discussion. At 11:55 a.m., a general meeting was held, chaired by Hu Shi, continuing to discuss the issue. At 12:45 p.m., the Chinese delegation hosted a public banquet for all committee members. At 2:30 p.m., a special round table conference was held to discuss the silver issue. At 3:00 p.m., Chen Liting hosted a tea party for all committee members. At 6:15 p.m., a meeting of ten groups was held. The points discussed are translated below.</p>
<p>The round table conference on labor issues and living standards discussed labor issues and living standards yesterday, and the new factory law for China was also extensively discussed by the committee members, as well as immigration issues, trade union issues, and how they affect people's living standards, and the ultimate need to solve the population problem by limiting productivity. The hosts of the round table conference were Mr. Barnes of the International Labor Bureau in Geneva, Mr. Aoshihua, Mr. Lunbao of the California Federation of Labor in the United States, and Professor Penny Zhi of the Philippines. Comments on the new factory law can be divided into two factions: realists and idealists. The standards stipulated in this law are higher than what most factories in China can currently implement. One faction believes that it is wrong to set such unattainable standards and that it would be better to be more conservative, which could bring immediate benefits. The other faction believes that establishing a higher standard, even if it can only be gradually realized, would be more effective. A member of the International Labor Bureau stated that the difference is not between realism and idealism, but rather the different concepts of the nature of law between the mainland and the United Kingdom. According to British standards, laws should stipulate what should actually be done, and it is hoped that this can be implemented immediately. However, the laws of European countries and mainland countries first establish a standard to be achieved and the mechanisms to achieve this standard, hoping that they will gradually take effect. The American Seamen's Act is one example. When this law was enacted, many owners of American shipping companies said that they would not be able to operate according to this law, and some even sold their ships to foreign companies. However, this law has not been repealed, and the number of American ships in the Pacific is now greater than before. This law is not fully implemented everywhere, but the time for its realization is approaching year by year. Without this law, today's achievements would not have been possible. All kinds of laws must be supported by public opinion. Therefore, the implementation of China's factory law must be actively carried out in conjunction with education, paying attention to public sentiment and understanding between employers and workers. American committee members emphasized the need for public sentiment to support the law, saying that although the American Seamen's Act has not been fully implemented, its achievements are already remarkable and can be gradually promoted. As for the Prohibition Law, it failed because it was not implemented and should be repealed. What hinders the full implementation of China's new factory law is the lack of capital of employers, the poverty of workers, and the lack of knowledge and misconceptions on both sides. Many factories in China are very small, and it is beyond their limited capital to fundamentally improve the equipment for workers. Even the workers themselves are not educated to a good level, and their family situation is even more difficult. If parents work in factories together and refuse to allow their children to enter, the harm may be greater than employing them. China's unstable political situation and the government's lack of power in the concessions also hinder the enforcement of this law. However, employers in the concessions can be persuaded to cooperate voluntarily through appropriate methods. The greatest need is to engage in education and pay attention to public sentiment. However, China's population is 400 million, and those affected by this factory law, including their dependents, are only a few million people. It seems that there should also be similar regulations to protect farmers. The round table conference also discussed the issue of immigration and its impact on living standards. However, in reality, countries have almost completely banned immigration from other countries, and countries with overpopulation have gradually realized that it is impossible to have legal or artificial guarantees for the mass migration of people to other countries. Therefore, this discussion is only theoretical. The benefits of immigration to other countries are widely recognized. Within certain limits, immigration countries can reduce the pressure of labor problems and receive remittances from abroad. The new methods and higher living standards of immigrants returning home can also have an impact on the country. However, if the number of immigrants is too large, causing a reduction in the number of workers in some industries, or if the number is too small, it is practically insignificant, or if the vacancies created by immigration are naturally filled by increased productivity or reduced mortality rates, then the above-mentioned effects cannot be achieved. In countries that absorb immigrants, considerable benefits can also be obtained due to increased domestic production and consumption. However, once it reaches a point where it cannot accommodate more, there is no benefit to be gained. What is the standard for this point? It is mostly due to the feelings of the people in the country, which cannot be determined objectively. In the past, the mass migration of Irish people to the Americas accounted for a large proportion of their total population. This was probably the last example of solving the population problem through immigration. Now, Japan's population increases by about 900,000 people every year. If they want to solve the problem in the same way, it is impossible. Even if there are still places in the world that can absorb this large number of immigrants every year, there are not enough ships to transport them. In recent years, many people from mainland China have migrated to Northeast China and other places, which is obviously beneficial to reducing the population in these provinces. It is now planned that the research committee will specifically study the impact of migration from Shandong to Northeast China, from Japan to Brazil, and from the Philippines to the United States, paying particular attention to how the knowledge and examples of immigrants returning home affect their home society. This influence has had special results in rural areas of Japan. The development of Chinese trade unions has also been discussed. The current trade unions in China, like those in Italy and Russia, are part of a political party structure and are different from the independent organizations in other countries. Although this type of trade union does not yet have a major impact on the labor community in China, its beginning is quite encouraging. If there are fair and knowledgeable people to lead them, there is even more hope. The various issues discussed in the round table conference all ultimately came down to the point of controlling the population. Small countries with overpopulation, such as Italy and Japan, are examples. Due to the development of modern medicine and hygiene, their mortality rates have suddenly decreased significantly, but the increase in productivity is not as high as that. Further research on the statistics of other countries shows that whenever the same phenomenon occurred one or two centuries ago, their productivity mostly decreased along with the mortality rate. Therefore, the population overpopulation problems in Japan and Italy should be temporary. Furthermore, according to the laws of biology, a good living environment is sufficient to reduce its productivity, and humans cannot be an exception to this. Even within the same country, the most prosperous class often has the lowest productivity, and the universal increase in living standards is followed by a universal decrease in productivity. Therefore, this rate often proceeds in two directions: reducing productivity is a necessary condition for changing other situations, and improving stable situations can naturally reduce productivity. All of this is a natural process and has nothing to do with education and restrictions.</p>
<h3>Chrysanthemum News from the Municipal Garden Nursery</h3>
<p>Due to the current situation, the exhibition will no longer be held.</p>
<p>Welcome to visit and purchase at low prices.</p>
<p>The Municipal Garden Nursery of the Municipal Social Bureau has always paid close attention to the cultivation of flowers and trees, and has conducted in-depth research on chrysanthemums. The chrysanthemum exhibitions held in the past have been highly praised by people from all walks of life. This year's chrysanthemum varieties, newly collected from foreign countries and various parts of the country, number about 100, together with the original varieties, totaling more than 300 varieties and reaching more than 4,000 pots. Recently, due to the current situation, it is heard that the exhibition will no longer be held, but all sectors are still welcome to visit and are sincerely invited. They are also willing to sell various precious varieties at low prices to the public.</p>
<h3>Municipal Public Security Bureau Ordered to Prohibit Dance Halls</h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau received an order from the Municipal Government stating that, in order to issue an order, the Ministry of Interior's document was approved, which was issued for consultation. The Executive Yuan Secretariat's letter was approved, stating that the letter from the Secretariat of the Central Executive Committee issued by Chiang, who also served as the President, was for the Hebei Provincial Party Affairs Rectification Committee to request a ban on commercial dance halls nationwide to encourage morality. The instruction was to hand it over to the Ministry of Interior, etc. Accordingly, the original document was copied and sent for consultation. Upon approval, it was found that dancing is a bad habit of Europe and the United States, which is most likely to corrupt the morality of the people. In this autumn of national crisis, it is necessary to strictly prohibit it to encourage decadent customs. Now that the previous reason has been approved, in addition to replying to the letter, the original document is copied and sent to your Municipal Government for consultation and instructing the subordinate authorities to prohibit it, etc. Upon approval, it is hereby ordered to copy and issue the attachment, ordering the Bureau to immediately comply with the prohibition and report the compliance situation. This order is issued.</p>

<h3>Chamber of Commerce Meeting on National Coal Transportation</h3>
<p>Convening Discussions between Shipping and Coal Industries</p>
<p>Although the Social Bureau has convened a meeting regarding the transportation of national coal and the problem of meeting consumption needs, a satisfactory solution has not been found. It is heard that the coal industry stated that the coal reserves in Shanghai are only 240,000 tons, which is only enough for one month's consumption, and that these 240,000 tons include both Japanese and national coal. The anti-Japanese National Salvation Conference decided to seal off these reserves. The industry, fearing a coal shortage, sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to find a solution. It is heard that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has scheduled a meeting on the 29th of this month to discuss the matter and has sent a letter to the Shipping Association to send representatives to attend.</p>
<h3>Chronicle of Good Deeds Undertaken by Pushan Villa</h3>
<p>Currently, due to a shortage of funds,</p>
<p>It is planned to seek donations from all sectors.</p>
<p>Pushan Villa has been handling various charitable deeds, such as burying the exposed in the Chinese concession and providing free medical treatment and medicine at the Pushan Hospital in Zhabei, for many years. However, the operating funds have never been fixed and rely entirely on donations from all sectors to cover expenses. In recent years, the area has been vast, the population has been dense, and there have been many corpses left on the roadside. The task of collecting them has become more and more complicated, and materials and labor are all expensive. Income is limited, but expenses are huge, and funds are very tight. It is estimated that from January to the end of September this year, a total of 675 large coffins and 21,698 small coffins were collected, including 8,814 straw bags. 547 large coffins and 8,814 small coffins were distributed. The hospital provided a total of 37,116 medical treatments and medications. This summer, due to the floods in various provinces, disaster victims came to Shanghai. The Municipal Government organized refugee shelters and commissioned the Villa to handle the aftermath of the disaster victims, including collecting the corpses. All the expenses for collecting workers, bedding, lime, coal chips, burial sites, transportation, and gasoline were outside the regular expenses, resulting in a huge increase in expenses, while donations were less than in previous years. However, the Villa has a place to go, and the burial work and the provision of free medical treatment and medicine at the hospital cannot be stopped, so expenses cannot be reduced. If this continues, it will be difficult to maintain. I have no choice but to appeal to all the great benefactors from all walks of life to generously donate to the Villa's charitable deeds, which are related to public health, so that they can benefit the people and accumulate immeasurable merit.</p>
<h3>Director Zhu Does Not Pursue the Surveyor</h3>

The court considered the matter to be minor, and Zhu did not pursue the matter deeply, so Su has been released on bail.</p>
<h3>Verdict in the Case of a Child Burned to Death by an Overturned Oil Pot in a Car Accident</h3>
<p>Wang Si Fined 300 Yuan</p>
<p>Wang Si, a Shandong native residing at No. 7 Shengteli, Luban Road, in the Chinese concession, was riding his No. 7125 bicycle past No. 149 Xujiahui Road in the French concession at 10:00 a.m. on the 14th of this month. To avoid a car, he rushed onto the sidewalk and overturned the oil pot of a glutinous rice cake stall. It happened that Ouyang Liansheng's four-year-old son, Changqing, from Danyang, was buying glutinous rice cakes nearby, and his face was burned by the hot oil, resulting in his death after ineffective treatment. Wang fled the scene after causing the accident. Later, the police investigated and detained Wang, sending him to the Second Special Court. The defendant denied causing the accident and was ordered to be retried at a later date. He was brought to court again yesterday, and the defendant still tried to quibble. After Shen Heyi and Wang Minglang (who was also injured while frying glutinous rice cakes) testified, he bowed his head and admitted the crime. Judge Luo sentenced Wang Si to a fine of 300 yuan for causing death due to negligence. If the fine is commuted, it will be calculated at two yuan per day. He is allowed to post a 300-yuan store guarantee.</p>
<h3>Husband and Concubine Dispute Over Child Case Awaiting Verdict</h3>
<p>Cai Chengzhang formerly took a Mrs. Xu as his concubine and had a son named Genbao, who is now seven years old. Two years ago, the two had a bad feeling, and the relationship between husband and concubine could not be maintained. They requested the court to resolve the matter, and it was ruled that they should separate. At that time, Genbao was only five years old and still needed the care of his mother, so he was still taken away by Mrs. Xu to raise him. Before long, Mrs. Xu changed her mind and remarried, and Genbao was also taken away as her stepson. Recently, Cai Chengzhang learned of this and negotiated with Mrs. Xu to return to his clan, but he was unsuccessful. He then hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the First Special District Local Court, requesting that the defendant be ordered to return Genbao. First, the Special Court summoned both parties to mediate, but to no avail. Yesterday morning, Judge Li formally opened the trial, and the defendant also hired lawyer Jiang Baolian to defend him. The defendant also stated that Genbao must wait until he is sixteen years old before he can be taken away by the plaintiff. However, the plaintiff could not wait and insisted that the defendant return him immediately. Although Judge Li tried his best to mediate, he was still unable to resolve the matter peacefully. He then ordered the lawyers of both parties to argue with each other and ordered them to withdraw, awaiting the verdict on the morning of the 31st of this month. Which side will this child ultimately belong to? It can be resolved according to law in a few days.</p>
<h3>Fire on Gonghe Xin Road</h3>
<p>Defulong Jingguang Goods Store at No. 348, the intersection of Gonghe Xin Road and Qiujiang Road in Zhabei, suddenly caught fire in the kitchen at 9:30 a.m. yesterday, and the fire immediately broke through the roof. Ye Jiesan, the police officer at Post No. 32 of the Zhongxing Road Police Station of the Fourth District Public Security Bureau, immediately reported to the fire department to send a fire truck to put out the fire and arrested Zhang Zhiliang, the person who started the fire, and brought him to the police station. He confessed that he was 25 years old and from Wuxi. The store was taken over from the previous owner, Wang Zipei, less than a week ago. Yesterday (the day before yesterday), because he was making doors, he left a lot of wood shavings in the kitchen and must have left a fire source, which led to the misfortune. There were two people in the store, and the shop assistant, Shi Chuqian, had gone out on business, etc. After the police station verified the confession, they immediately reported it to the Fourth District. It is estimated that the floors of the Shuntai Department Store and the Sock Store on the left and right were partially burned, and the fire was extinguished at about 10:00 a.m. However, when the Xingchang Qianzhuang store at No. 352, the northern neighbor, was destroyed by the fire, someone opened the back door, went upstairs, and seized 1,300 yuan in cash and foreign currency, as well as about 600 yuan worth of gold, silver, and jewelry from a small box. It is heard that the burned stores were not insured against fire.</p>
<h3>Director Yu of the Yutang River Trade Union of the County Committee</h3>
<p>Since the death of the previous director, Yang Fu, of the Committee for Dredging Yutang River in the county, there has been a lack of leadership in the association, which has hindered the progress of the river project. Therefore, the county government appointed Sun Shiben (Director of the Third District of Beiqiao) as the director and issued an order to him yesterday, urging him to proceed with the plan in accordance with the predetermined steps and to complete the project within the year, and to report the progress to the county government for inspection.</p>
<h3>Huang Chunsun Undertakes Advertising for Huashang Electric Tram</h3>

<h3>A Sign of Innovation in the Pharmaceutical Industry</h3>
<p>The blood tonic "Libo Luosui" issued by Nanshi Fukang Western Medicine Store, includes the Chinese formula in the leaflet, and is also afraid that people will not believe it, so it publishes an extremely simple and easy test method to print and send, so that anyone can test the authenticity for themselves and compare it with foreign goods to see if they are the same. In the past, when selling medicine, they only said how effective it was, but did not say what should not be used. Now, Fukang also declares the contraindications in the advertisement in advance to avoid customers buying the wrong medicine. The selling price is also extremely low, less than one-third of that of imported goods. This is truly a sign of innovation in China's pharmaceutical industry.</p>

<h3>Tenants of Shuntaili Oppose Rent Increase</h3>
<p>The landlord of Shuntaili in Zhabei has re-proposed a rent increase of 29% per room for tenants and a rent increase from 16 yuan to 30 yuan per room for shops, a rent increase of 90%. Considering the difficult business conditions in Zhabei, it is difficult for tenants and shops in the alley to bear the burden. On the morning of the day before yesterday, a meeting of all tenants was held at Fuxing Garden Restaurant on Baoshan Road. Many tenants attended the meeting. Zhou Ziyan, a tenant, first reported on the resolution of last year's rent increase and water fee dispute. Next, the meeting discussed how to deal with this rent increase. It was unanimously agreed that the houses in this alley were built more than ten years ago, when the foundation materials and labor were cheap, so the cost was very low. After several rent increases, the rent has become very high, which is not much different from newly built houses. At this time of national crisis and turmoil, the landlord is arbitrarily increasing the rent, which is obviously only for his own benefit and disregards the suffering of all tenants. It was decided to absolutely deny the rent increase and send a letter of rebuttal first. One representative was elected from each alley, and ten representatives were elected from the shops. Zhou Ziyan, Wu Zenggui, and Ren Pengnian were mutually elected as standing persons in charge to carry out various matters, hoping to achieve the purpose of canceling the rent increase. It is also heard that representative meetings will be held every week thereafter, and the location will still be at Fuxing Garden on Baoshan Road.</p>

<h3>Publication of Tanaka's Memorial on Annexing Manchuria and Mongolia in English</h3>
<p>Japanese Prime Minister Tanaka once had a plan to annex Manchuria and Mongolia and submitted a memorial to the Emperor. The full text was translated and published in the "English China Review Weekly," Volume 4, Number 39. It sold out soon after publication. Although it was reprinted, it still could not meet the demand. Therefore, the publisher specially printed 100,000 copies of a separate edition, charging only five yuan per hundred copies to cover costs. It is now reported that the book has been published. Those who pre-ordered for inclusion have already had them sent out separately. Those who wish to purchase now can contact the China Review Weekly office at 50 Beijing Road immediately.</p>

<h3>How to Unite the People's Hearts Nationwide Against Foreign Aggression by Ding Jichan</h3>
<p>(The authorities must have the determination to endure hardship and sacrifice before the people's hearts can be united.)</p>
<p>To unite the people's hearts nationwide, the central and provincial authorities must have the determination to endure hardship and sacrifice. Naturally, they will think clearly, have reservations, commit fewer evils, and set a good example. All directions will follow, and the masses will be of one mind. If there is foreign aggression, there is no need for propaganda; they will unite. Regardless of North or South, new or old, any person in power who exclusively uses their own cliques, excludes dissidents, seeks luxurious houses, beautiful concubines, and savings, and only pursues illicit gains and embellishes civilization will, imperceptibly, ruin the country. Pointed at by ten fingers and watched by ten thousand eyes, devoid of morality and popular support, national affairs cannot be accomplished. Since the founding of the Republic of China, those in power have not been able to escape this. Even if policies and ideologies are clear and attractive, without the expression and action of enduring hardship and sacrifice, they cannot save the country and will only repeat the same old farce. Material enjoyment is certainly valuable, but it must have corresponding conditions. Otherwise, it is plunder and seizure, let alone the great cause of saving the country. Not to mention Mahatma Gandhi of India, look at Mussolini of Italy. How public-spirited and loyal to the country he is, and how thrifty he is! He proclaimed the country's wealth, military strength, and unity, which is valued by the world. In Japan today, everyone has good food to eat and good houses to live in, and the rulers still want to seek better food and better houses for the people, focusing on external development. But in China, floods, droughts, locusts, and bandits cause death everywhere, and politicians and dignitaries still want to extract oil from the dead for their own enjoyment. How can the country not perish? Whether new or old, if those in power only have pleasant policies and words without deeds, it will be difficult to unite the people's hearts. In the era of Yuan Shikai, were the major policies and guidelines not pleasing to the eye and ear? Therefore, if you do not want to save the country and unite the people's hearts, then so be it. Otherwise, the authorities should begin with the determination to endure hardship and sacrifice.</p>

<h3>The Conflict Between the Indigenous People and Chinese in North Kalongan (Part 2) by Qiu Bincun</h3>
<p>4.  The Background of Anti-Chinese Sentiment</p>
<p>The wave of anti-Chinese sentiment among the indigenous people of North Kalongan appears, on the surface, to be merely a kind of unconscious and violent act. However, upon closer examination, it is by no means so simple. Behind the scenes, there must be imperialists orchestrating a well-organized anti-Chinese movement. The general public, failing to notice, mistakenly believes it to be a minor matter not worth serious consideration. In fact, we should not underestimate the indigenous people's anti-Chinese plan this time. At first, they used knives and iron implements to implement their policies of terror. Seeing that the overseas Chinese were tolerant everywhere, enduring mistreatment, and offering no opportunity to exploit, they changed to using handguns and shooting at night, injuring Mr. Huang Junyi and others. The resulting strike was triggered by this bullet. This was probably the first successful step of the imperialists in instigating the indigenous people's movement.</p>
<p>The anti-Chinese movement used verbal propaganda, such as fabricating rumors that Chinese merchants were poisoning rice, sugar, coffee, cigarettes, and other goods, in order to incite the ignorant. They also used news media, fabricating various false news stories in the Malay-language Happiness Newspaper published in Semarang, such as rumors of poisoning food. These rumors were treated as facts and published solemnly. They also fabricated the false news that "Chinese leader Li Delu of North Kalongan was arrested." It was said that "Mr. Li was arrested and imprisoned for buying thirty private handguns." They even said that "Chen Yinglai privately hid explosives, which were found by the police in Chen's home, and Chen was arrested." In fact, neither Mr. Li nor Mr. Chen had bought handguns or hidden explosives, let alone been arrested. The fabrication of such news by the newspaper was probably intentional. Mr. Li and Mr. Chen have already sued the Malay-language newspaper in the North Kalongan government office. How can there be justice in a government office supported by the Dutch?</p>
<p>Furthermore, since the outbreak of the anti-Chinese wave, the number of indigenous people's shops in various villages has sprung up like mushrooms after rain, and rumors of poisoning have followed. All of the above proves that the anti-Chinese wave among the indigenous people is indeed backed by a larger force. More recently, the prohibition of porters from carrying water for overseas Chinese and the instigation of servants not to work in overseas Chinese shops or residences are merely oppressive measures intended to force overseas Chinese to leave. In short, the anti-Chinese sentiment among the indigenous people of North Kalongan this time is driven by a small number of ambitious individuals instigated by imperialists and dominated by their own greed for money, aiming to seize the existing position of overseas Chinese in the business world. As the saying goes, "Trouble arises on the heads of the weak," and the overseas Chinese have suffered the consequences first. The ignorant villagers are hypnotized by them and unwittingly become the demon dogs of the ambitious.</p>
<p>5.  The Mediation Process</p>
<p>The indigenous people's anti-Chinese sentiment was caused by being temporarily deceived by imperialists. Malay and Chinese enlightened elements knew that the overseas Chinese were not their enemies after all, so they turned to seek various ways to mediate.</p>
<p>(1) A conference of representatives of the Chinese and Malay people was held at the Dutch government office in North Kalongan, attended by about 600 people, but without much success.</p>
<p>(2) Later, Malay officials talked with overseas Chinese leaders and agreed to separately convene meetings of the Chinese and Malay people. A general meeting of overseas Chinese was convened at the North Kalongan Chinese School, attended by about 800 people. The next day, a meeting was held under the leadership of Lehen, attended by about 2,000 people. Both of the above meetings yielded good results, and the local situation gradually stabilized.</p>
<p>(3) On the 14th of last month, prominent figures from all walks of life of the Chinese, Malay, and Indian communities held a meeting at the residence of Shaylun, the editor-in-chief of the Malay-language Business Newspaper, to discuss resolving the "ethnic conflict between the Chinese and Malay communities" in North Kalongan. It was decided on the spot to establish a "Preparatory Committee for Resolving Chinese-Malay Hostility in North Kalongan." Those who attended the meeting that day included Mr. Zhan Jinfu, Mr. Lin Chunmian, Mr. Yahaaxi, Mr. Shaylun, Mr. Hong Yuanyuan, Mr. Liang Youlan, lawyer Huang Changshen, Mr. Musa, Mr. Jiala, Mr. Aisehafu, Mr. Yayajiada, and Mr. Xu Yuntang. Mr. Yalatada, Mr. Zhan Jinfu, Mr. Hong Yuanyuan, Mr. Yalai Lusi, and Mr. Muhamad Nuer of the preparatory committee signed and issued a large number of invitation letters, inviting a joint meeting of representatives of Chinese, Malay, and Indian community organizations. The venue was the Chinese Qunli Sports Association, and the date was the 19th of last month at 9:30 AM. (1) Discuss the organization of a committee to resolve Chinese-Malay hostility in North Kalongan. (2) Elect representatives of the Chinese, Malay, and Indian communities to go to North Kalongan and jointly resolve Chinese-Malay ethnic hostility with the leaders of the Chinese, Malay, and Indian communities there, but they must respect the local officials. On the 19th, representatives of the three ethnic groups arrived at the venue one after another, with about 100 people attending. The political investigation department also sent personnel to observe. Mr. Yalatadas was elected as chairman. After taking the chair, Mr. Ya announced the purpose of today's meeting and invited everyone present to express their opinions. Mr. Mai Fo said that the anti-Chinese wave in North Kalongan was not as Mr. Zhan said, as the Chinese still have many hidden worries, and the indigenous people also have many hidden worries, so it cannot be blamed solely on one side. Mr. Mai hoped that the anti-Chinese wave would subside as soon as possible. Mr. Yalai Dulu Si gave a long speech, saying that the feelings between the Chinese and Malay people are very deep and that they should organize a community to facilitate cooperation. If there were various Chinese and Malay community organizations after the outbreak of the anti-Chinese wave in North Kalongan, it would be easier to resolve. The Malay people of Nanyang express sympathy for all Chinese movements, and vice versa. The Chinese newspapers also promote all movements of the Malay people of Nanyang. Mr. Yi Sijianda, a representative from Ba Shunlan, repeated his speech from the previous meeting in Mawu. Mr. Yi said that the Malay people of Nanyang express deep sympathy for all Chinese movements, and they highly respect the sympathy expressed by the Malay people of Nanyang towards the Chinese. Therefore, the hostility that occurred in North Kalongan this time is regrettable. He also suggested that the committee of the three ethnic groups be established quickly and send representatives to resolve the situation. Mr. Yi said that a small conflict occurred in 1925, which started with disputes among the lower classes and escalated. The same is true of the current wave of hostility. The committee handling this work should thoroughly investigate in order to clarify right and wrong and determine who is to blame. Those who are at fault should apologize, and those who are not at fault should be persuaded with kind words. However, Mr. Yi strongly denied the reports in various newspapers that the dispute was caused by Chinese people who prioritize profit and petty merchants arguing. According to Mr. Yi, there are no Chinese moneylenders in North Kalongan. He hopes that reconciliation is not only for this time but should be a long-term plan.</p>
<p>Mr. Hong Yuanyuan said that the Chinese are a most peace-loving people. The Chinese have lived here for hundreds of years, upholding peace. The Malay people of Nanyang, who live together, are also peaceful. It is regrettable that the Chinese and Malay peace-loving people suddenly experienced a wave of hostility. Mr. Hong also said that he does not agree with Mr. Yi Sijianda's proposal to investigate who is at fault. Although this proposal is well-intentioned, it is difficult to implement. Our only goal is reconciliation. Only after reconciliation can we distinguish right from wrong. Mr. Qiu Wenxiu asked whether reconciliation is necessary and whether it can be effective. Two large meetings have already been held in North Kalongan, and a reconciliation committee has been organized. For two weeks, there have been no reports of any conflicts in North Kalongan. The outbreak of hostility occurred among the lower classes, while those handling the reconciliation are all intellectuals. Mr. Zhan Jinfu said that for two weeks, there have been no reports of any conflicts, but the representatives sent by the reconciliation committee are working with the leaders of the three ethnic groups in North Kalongan. He is afraid that there will be conflicts again. Mr. Saida Rulin said that a similar small conflict occurred in Wanlong the other day, and the result was a loss. Therefore, he hoped that the peace movement would be carried out quickly and that it would be addressed in a practical way in order to eliminate the root cause. Mr. Suli Luo said that the anti-Chinese wave did not originate among intellectuals. When a conflict occurred in 1927, the Chinese expressed sympathy when the indigenous people held a large meeting. To resolve this case, celebrities outside of factions should be selected. If people from factions are appointed as committee members or representatives, the blame will fall on the factions if they do not handle it properly in the future. The North Kalongan conflict has occurred more than once, all due to business competition. Therefore, for this reconciliation, it is necessary not only to resolve hostility but also to reconcile business competition. The various cases that have occurred in North Kalongan are all due to religion, mostly initiated by religious leaders, each with their own disciples and factions. If reconciliation is not handled properly, it is feared that it will become more intense.</p>
<p>After several meetings and mediations, the anti-Chinese wave from the indigenous people that had been surging like a whale wind and crocodile waves for several months finally calmed down, and they lived in peace. It can be considered a stroke of luck in misfortune.</p>
<p>We overseas Chinese have entrusted ourselves to foreign lands. The relationship between us and the people of the local area, especially the Malay people of Nanyang, the only way out for overseas Chinese, has always been good between guests and hosts. If the Malay people of North Kalongan had not been instructed and manipulated by imperialists, they would never have stirred up this滔天巨浪. Therefore, we want to advise all the Malay people in the colonies of Nanyang to understand that we overseas Chinese are not your enemies. In other words, overseas Chinese are your good friends. You must recognize that the imperialists are your real enemies. We also hope that our overseas Chinese who live in the colonies under the iron heel of imperialism will do their best to maintain friendly relations with the local people and try to avoid any hostility. We must guide, encourage, and support their national self-determination and the revolutionary movements to resist their suzerain states.</p>
<h3>Recent Overview of Soviet Russian Industry by Lin</h3>
<p>Rapid Progress in Production</p>
<p>Soviet Russia's efforts in production to complete its Five-Year Plan will have a great impact on world commerce in the future. This is generally recognized. Now, Soviet Russia's foreign trade is increasing day by day, and its exports are sold in Europe and America in large quantities. In Europe, Germany ranks first in Soviet Russia's international trade, followed by the United States. After Germany and the United States, the third place goes to the United Kingdom. These are all based on the Soviet Russian foreign trade statistics for the first half of 1931, i.e., this year.</p>
<p>In the first six months of 1931, the value of goods exported from the United Kingdom to Russia was 33,051,000 rubles, and the value of Russian imports was 92,277,000 rubles. Germany has the largest trade, with the value of goods exported to Russia being 162,718,000 rubles, and the value of Russian imports being 73,420,000 rubles. The United States ranks second, with the value of goods exported to Russia being 142,652,000 rubles, and the value of Russian imports being 10,214,000 rubles. Russian imports are mostly engineering machinery and metal products, with electrical engineering equipment and chemicals also accounting for a large number. In the first six months of 1931, Soviet Russia's foreign trade totaled 883,534,000 rubles, compared to 1,009,992,000 rubles in the same period last year.</p>
<p>According to announcements from various departments of the Soviet Russian government and commercial statistics from the Moscow Western Business Bureau, Soviet Russian industry showed significant progress in July of this year, especially in the production of coal, oil, carbon, and machinery. In July of this year, Soviet Russia produced 4,378,000 tons of coal, compared to 3,406,000 tons in the same period in 1930, an increase of 20%. The largest coal-producing area in Soviet Russia, the Donets region, produced 3,155,000 tons of coal in July, compared to 2,658,000 tons in the same period last year.</p>
<p>Among all industries, the electrical machinery industry has made the most progress. In July of this year, the electrical machinery industry produced electrical materials worth 61,500,000 rubles (each ruble is worth about 50 cents in US dollars), compared to 38,500,000 rubles in July of last year. The quality of various electrical materials has also greatly improved. The electrical machinery factories produce a wide range of machinery, including high-power turbines, switchboards, and radio materials, all in large quantities. The "Stanlin" turbine made by the Leningrad factory, with a capacity of 50,000 kilowatts, is a clear example.</p>
<p>The value of large machinery manufactured by various factories in July was 27,000,000 rubles, compared to 20,000,000 rubles in July of last year, an increase of nearly 30%. In the past seven months, the total value of products from various manufacturers of large machinery was 183,500,000 rubles, compared to 152,500,000 rubles in the same period last year. The increase in agricultural machinery is also considerable. In July of this year, the agricultural machinery produced by "Soviet Selmash" was worth 36,000,000 rubles, compared to 25,000,000 rubles in the same period last year, an increase of 45%.</p>
<p>The production of oil has also increased significantly compared to last year. A total of 2,000,000 tons were produced in July of this year, compared to 1,600,000 tons in the same period last year. Looking at the statistics for seven months, the numbers are still very impressive. In the seven months of 1931, a total of 12,500,000 tons of oil were produced, compared to 9,100,000 tons in the seven months of last year, an increase of 27%. The increase in carbon production is more than double. In July of this year, the machine-made carbon department produced a total of 34,400,000 tons, compared to only 6,500,000 tons in the same period last year. The progress in the Leningrad region is obvious everywhere. The length of the water supply has increased from 673 kilometers to 860 kilometers. The sewer system has increased from 486 kilometers to 885 kilometers. The streetcar system has increased from 124 to 410. The number of streetcars has increased to 1,000. Streetlights have been expanded to 70%. The entire city is now using electricity, compared to only 19% before the war.</p>
<p>The population of Leningrad is currently only 2,390,000 people, but various plans are now being used to increase it to 4,000,000 people. It is expected that after the completion of the second Five-Year Plan, there will be 4,000 streetcars, 3,500 buses, and 2,250 hired cars. The number of motorboats on the Neva River will be 300. By the time the first Five-Year Plan is completed, Leningrad will have 35 bathhouses, each with 500 bathtubs, and the number of large machine laundries will also increase to 25. The area of the land-based park will increase by 50%.</p>
<p>Soviet Russia is also working hard on automobile manufacturing. There are currently two major automobile manufacturing plants engaged in this industry. The first one is in Moscow, which was renovated and updated from an old factory, and is equipped with the latest machinery. The factory is currently producing a small number of cars, but it can produce 25,000 cars per year, including both passenger cars and trucks.</p>
<p>The second factory, named the Karkov Automobile Factory, started operating on October 1st and can produce 50,000 towed automobiles annually in the style of International Harvester. The government and the press attach great importance to this, saying that it will have a profound impact on Soviet Russia's future industry.</p>
<p>Soviet Russia is extremely rich in coal and oil reserves and ranks third among the countries with the most oil production in the world. The Five-Year Plan also included detailed plans for the production and sales of oil. Therefore, the Soviet Russian oil industry has become an important market in world trade and has jumped to the second place among the countries with the most oil production. It is expected that the oil production during the five-year period will reach a huge amount of 46,000,000 tons, and the period may not even require five years.</p>
<p>The first batch of kerosene to China, totaling 3,100,000 gallons, was loaded and shipped from the Soviet Russian oil-producing area of Batum on September 22nd and is expected to arrive in Shanghai around October 25th. Batum is located on the Black Sea and is a major oil-producing area. In the future, oil tankers will be used to transport large quantities of kerosene to the East via the Suez Canal. The oil is extracted by a large oil trust with a huge capital to exploit the oil in the entire Soviet Russia and sell it to the East and around the world, and the business is expected to be very prosperous.</p>

<h3>A Tram Driver Talks About Resisting Japan</h3>
<p>— Wen Qing</p>
<p>In the third-class ward of a small hospital in the northern part of the city, I visited an old friend whom I hadn't seen in a long time. She was lying in bed, moaning in pain. I shared five yuan of my bread money with her and told her about the atrocities the Japanese were still committing in Liaodong. As I left, she saw me off with a few grateful tears. Stepping out of the hospital, a gust of evening wind, carrying the chill of late autumn, made me shiver. Anti-Japanese slogans pasted on the walls along the road trembled in the dim light, buffeted by the cold wind. Few pedestrians were out, and only one or two rickshaws lingered, looking for fares. Suddenly, the sound of firecrackers echoed from afar, startling men and women in the alleys who ran out, looking around in alarm, whispering to each other. It was a scene of utter desolation.</p>
<p>I walked alone to North Sichuan Road, which was much livelier. Japanese marines, armed to the teeth, were swaggering along the road. When Chinese compatriots saw them, their eyes blazed with anger, and they wished they could destroy those Japanese pirates’ corpses and turn them to ashes.</p>
<p>I waited for a while at the tram stop. Usually, the third-class car was packed with passengers like ants on a sugar cube, but tonight the car was pitifully empty. Besides me, there was only an old man in his fifties. The tram drivers, who were usually busy selling tickets, opening doors, and checking fares, sat quietly on the long benches like first-class passengers. They seemed to be talking about how hateful the Japanese were. Because I was reading a book, I didn't have time to pay attention to what they were discussing. Occasionally, one or two passengers would get on and off, interrupting their spirited conversation. Later, no more passengers came on, and more and more tram drivers boarded, some carrying money bags, others holding ticket boards. The long benches on both sides of the car were almost full. They began to discuss resisting Japan as if they were holding a meeting. A tram driver with a money bag held up an evening newspaper and said,</p>
<p>"The Japanese are so wicked! They have occupied our Chinese land and killed our Chinese compatriots. Our Chinese soldiers haven't fought them, but they are arrogantly provoking Chinese people on Sichuan Road. If our Chinese soldiers don't open fire and drive them away, I'm afraid they will occupy our Shanghai!"</p>
<p>"Yes, if we fight them, we must win. There are many Chinese people! Now merchants and students have organized volunteer armies. If the workers also join, there will be even more! We alone have more than two thousand tram drivers. If each of us kills one Japanese, we will kill more than two thousand Japanese. If each of us kills ten Japanese, we will kill more than twenty thousand Japanese. We should fight, fight, fight!"</p>
<p>"You don't have a gun, what will you use to fight?"</p>
<p>"We demand that the National Government give us guns to fight."</p>
<p>"We don't know how to use a gun, what should we do?"</p>
<p>"What's so difficult about using a gun? You can learn it in a month!"</p>
<p>"A-Si's words are very courageous. We tram drivers should organize a volunteer army. If we can learn to use a gun in a month, we two thousand-plus tram workers can rush forward to fight the Japanese. If we kill them all, we will have rendered a great service!"</p>
<p>A tall tram driver said. The others around him chimed in,</p>
<p>"Good! We nominate you as the commander-in-chief of the tram driver vanguard! Okay?" They said and laughed.</p>
<p>"Don't laugh at me for not being qualified to be commander-in-chief. When the country is in danger, anyone who has the courage to rush forward and kill the enemy soldiers is more glorious than being a commander-in-chief!"</p>
<p>"You seem brave when you talk now, but I'm afraid you'll be a little afraid of dying when you get to the battlefield."</p>
<p>"It's better to die on the battlefield as a savior of the country than to live in the world as a slave of a fallen nation!"</p>
<p>"This reasoning is very correct. We should die for saving the country!" they said in unison.</p>
<p>"To save the country, we must organize a volunteer army. We don't have time to practice, which is the fundamental problem!"</p>
<p>"The best thing would be to ask the company to let us start driving a little later in the morning and stop work a little earlier in the evening, so that we can take two hours a day to practice. As long as everyone studies hard, I'm afraid we can get the hang of it in a month!"</p>
<p>The tram stopped at the last stop, Jing'an Temple. I got off alone, while they were still excitedly discussing plans to resist Japan.</p>
