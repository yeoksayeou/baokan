<p>德政府下令零售商人可不必遵守批發商所定之零售價格藉以打破同業組合之壟斷意蓋在獎勵商業競爭使物價得以减低也然據柏林電一九三○年之德國零售商業所入總額較上年減少三百萬馬克而所售貨物數量則與上年相差無幾是物價已經减低而德政府猶下令零售商人自由定價者因德國一方面年來物價過昻一方面人民購買力愈弱故物價雖已减低而尙未足以應社會之狀態也德政府推究其原以爲物價之不能大减由於同業組合之壟斷故欲打破同業組合操縱物價之習使零售小商得有自由發展之機會固亦未嘗非獎勵商業競爭之一法然以今日世界之現狀論之貿易如是之不振民力如是之竭蹶價值稍昻之物即已無人顧問批發商爲維持營業計亦將有不能壟斷之勢所謂同業組合者自必熟審情勢而决不一味把持以自利也在零售商方面雖可以低價競爭但有成本關係亦不能過低其價以致虧折總之在此現在經濟狀態之下欲求所以發展其商業其道甚難恐非減低物價一端所能有效況乎减低物價之事亦有種種關係非政府一令所能强行也</p>

<h3>商務會議開幕花絮</h3>
<p>孫籌成</p>
<p>京滬滬杭甬鐵路當局。爲改進運輸事業。函邀兩路附近商界代表。並請專家委員。在滬開會討論。籌成代表新藥業同業公會。亦在出席之列。爰將會場花絮錄述如下。</p>
<p>一室春生會塲在老靶子路福生路儉德儲蓄會。出席代表計一百七十餘人。室小人稠。布置不易。故議席皆直排計七行。均面對面坐。如火車上二等車然。桌上覆以白毯。每人座前均有玻璃杯清茶一盅。會塲僕役。以車上西惠與侍者充任。故應酬頗週到。台上置紅木琴桌一。上舖五彩錦地台毯。色甚鮮豔。左右各設速記席由聶德聲黃孝先二君分任速記。上懸紙彩及五色電燈。成十字形。屋之四角。均裝火爐。溫暖異常。</p>
<p>重頭好戲上海市商會代表王曉籟。開幕時演說甚長。分減輕運費。與運輸負責兩大綱。及廉價。迅速。安全三要點。幷聲明所提議案。望路局勿視爲商人增進自身利益之要求。而視爲輔助路局增進營業之策劃。引用民法六四一條。請路局對於運輸通則第二節第八條加以修正。義正辭嚴。聽者動容。下午在歡迎席上。王君致歡迎詞時。又有極長之演說。引用子思及曾國藩成語。詳述歷來會議通病。主此次議决各案。逐一列表。由各商會負責督促實施。語甚率直。在座代表。一致贊成。馮雲書即席謂王曉籟今日唱兩次</p>
<h3>國府要人組織俱樂部</h3>
<p>履·冰</p>
<p>首都在勵志社。爲政界要人公餘遊宴之地。社中規則。釐定頗嚴。內有蔣主席所書之十誡。烟酒嗜好。均在禁止之列。入社者須經過縝密之審查。故手續亦殊不易。自玄武湖改爲五洲公園。由當局派人整理。佈置清潔。風景幽勝。於是佳客名媛。遊屐紛至。國府諸要人從政之餘。亦往往涉足其間。留連景色。昔時荒湖。頓成熱鬧。近則何應欽孫科王正廷等。以提倡政界人員公餘正當娛樂。特發起在玄武湖畔。成立一俱樂部。地址現已覓妥。名稱擬定爲荷院。因湖水漣漪。植荷甚盛。且出汚泥而不染。亦表示高潔之意也。俱樂部中。將備高尙娛樂。一部爲球塲。並將徵集中國樂器。以資陶冶性情。餘如象棋圍棋等項。亦均設備。發起之際。暫定每人入會費爲二百元。刻正在徵求會員中云。</p>
<p>重頭好戲。應拍手捧塲。衆皆附和。遂鼓掌如雷。</p>
<p>相率登高十五日舉行開幕典禮。自上午九時起。至十一時半禮成。秩序單上尙有攝影一項。司儀員乃高呼﹁請各代表至屋頂花園拍照﹂。電梯每次最多容八人。二百左右之來賓及代表。如皆欲乘電梯。則裝運需時。故除年老體衰。曁身軀肥胖者。分乘電梯外。餘皆相率由否梯登高。屋係五層。約有百餘石級。遠望之。煞是好看。及抵屋頂。無不面紅耳亦。氣喘如牛矣丶</p>
<h3>紫羅蘭宴客紫羅蘭</h3>
<p>天恨</p>
<p>久負盛名之歌舞家紫羅蘭女士。又臨滬瀆矣。前晚七時。大宴賓客於金陵酒家之紫羅蘭廳。瘦鵑生平酷愛紫羅蘭。因花及人。亦復劇賞紫羅蘭之歌舞。是晚招待賓客。跋來報往。爲狀至勞。而雙輔間乃時有笑容展露。則知其中心必甚快。不自覺其勞也。來賓百數十人。濟濟一堂。塔稱盛宴。所可異者。賓衆中凡初識紫羅蘭女士面。莫不訝其年齡之稚。與其理想中之紫羅蘭不相侔。不佞亦然。蓋女士於二年前來滬奏藝時。即博得大名遠被。萬口爭傳。今日測其年事。至少當在十八九。又孰知其芳齡。纔及月圓之數也。然月圓之數。猶是以國曆計之者。若以廢曆計之。則僅二七。前此來滬時。祇十二歲耳。即此可知其歌舞之藝。實由天賦。故爲他人所不及。未幾入席。先由瘦鵑致介紹詞。旣而女士致感謝詞。皆極得體。女士操粵語。瘦鵑慮座上客不能了解。請姚君偉君任翻譯。遂能盡達其意洎乎席半。女士復起而試其歌喉。由某君操絃。歌狸貓換太子青衣一段。嗓音與腔調。均臻上乘丶衆又異之。不謂其亦長於二黃也。畢。復歌粵曲瀟湘琴怨丶以三種樂器合而和之。歌喉清越。或抑或揚。泠泠然傳出琴與怨之神態。瀟湘妃子之內心。不啻若自其口出。誠神乎其技矣。衆大鼓掌。見女士歌已入座。意不能足。仍鼓掌不止。女士囅然又起。歌雨打芭蕉一曲以饗衆賓。樂猶是也。歌喉亦猶是也。而意境逈殊。聆之。淅淅瀝瀝。倐驟倐徐。渾似雨打芭蕉。歷亂有致。初不僅悅耳而已也。前人所謂﹁此曲祇應天上有。人間那得幾回聞﹂。不佞於女士之歌。實同此感丶故歸而爲之記。</p>
<h3>雪中游西湖記</h3>
<p>俞劍華</p>
<p>與西子別六七年矣。六橋三竺。時縈夢寐。惟以事覊。不克重遊。今年更爲筆墨所困。會有老友季君雪雲。長西湖第一初小。苦邀相過。乃於一月九日過午。滿天風雪中乘車以去。車中途多誤。抵杭已夜半二時。寒風刺骨。飛雪撲面。西子畏冷。深閉黑幕中不可見。惟環湖電炬灼灼。如珠鍊而已。是夜宿昭慶寺初小校中。翌日偕季君出遊。遍山皆雪湖。水俱氷。彌望如銀鑲玉琢。時縈夢寐之西子雖較消瘦。然淡妝素抹。更饒嫵媚。抵葛嶺望寳俶塔。其西則大石離列。穿石罅。雪深沒脛。氷滑不可躋。乃扶掖攀援蛇行而前。至紫雲洞。梅花已有兩三株放者。洞在巨崖下。奇峭動人魄。氣溫如春。上鍊丹亭。登初陽台。下山遊黃龍洞。多假山。頗似蘇州之獅子林。泉水淙淙綜下流。旁結氷乳。長四五尺。如柱。季君折一枚。肩之以行。見者大笑。西行曲折約十里。至玉泉。觀五色魚。魚小者活潑。大者穩重。遇食不爭。有君子風焉。出寺飯於靈隱。飛來峰在靈隱山門內。巨石崚嶒。玲瓏懸空。幻爲奇觀。謁五百羅漢堂。北上至韜光。夾道綠竹千章。搖曳多姿。足疲矣。賈勇升北高峰。俯瞰全湖。如圓鏡。之江蜿　。東入於海。西望萬山起伏。咸出足下。及下山。日已夕矣。乃乘車歸寺。十一日早步至城隍山。山踞城市。多廟。多士。周山則市肆駢比如方罫。屋頂俱白。下山。過四眼井覘石屋洞。洞多佛。有坡翁題字。探水樂洞。洞深數十丈。奇暖乃不可耐。水聲潨然。有石筍丶石藕。石皷。石鐘諸蹟。復上爲烟霞洞。洞高曠多石乳丶至龍井。清水一泓。以茶名於世。下山入九溪十八澗。溪隨山轉。山隨步移。幽峭深邃。回環曲折。若不可窮。出山至江干。觀六和塔。遠望塔乃如鴿籠。以足疲未登。歸途至虎跑寺。濟公塔。泉清冽爲西湖冠。及回寺已晚。十二日獨遊孤山。訪蘇小小武松秋瑾諸墓。歷公園放鶴亭西泠印社。時湖氷甚堅。人多步行其上。舟膠不能動。故未能作湖遊。過午遊杭垣。市廛商業頗盛。市政銳進冠全國。十三日始歸海上。風止日煦。寒亦稍殺。乃呵凍記之。</p>
<h3>巴黎物語</h3>
<p>（七）六曾寄於巴黎</p>
<p>（二）鐵達尼遇難記</p>
<p>記得十餘年前在高等小學的國文敎科書裏讀到鐵達尼（Ｔｉｔａｎｉｃ）郵船沉沒記時。曾受過狠深的感動。在近代文化史裏面鐵達尼郵船觸冰沉沒一事的確算得一個最動人的災禍了。現代法國詩人ＰａｎｕｌＣｌａｕｄｅｌ還做過一首狠沉的詩詠這故事可惜我現在不便在此地譯出。</p>
<p>最近法國名導演家杜（Ｅ．Ａ．Ｄｕｐｏｎｔ）又想到再把這悲壯的往事重現在銀幕上我們對於那些不寺的遭難者更加一番憑弔。他把Ｔｉｔａｎｉｃ改作了Ａｔｌａｎｔｉｓ但他編製這影片的重要着眼點。不單在描寫那整個的人類社會沉沒在一片汪洋大海的壯觀。而在解剖那些被難者的心裏狀況和人類同時保有的許多優點和弱點。</p>
<p>這影片最先現出的是一隻航渡大西洋的郵船的吃烟室的一角。幾個乘客在玩一種呌作　Ｂｒｉｄｇａ的紙牌遊戲。圍着桌子坐着的有一個半身不遂的學者詹佛理和患着心臓病才好的他的兒子和媳婦。另外還有一個呌作郎柏的大實業家。位置在牌桌旁但却沒有玩牌的學者的太太和一個嗜酒的滑稽脚色。並一個受着紐約某劇院招聘的法國歌人。</p>
<p>這影片的最初一部分似乎演得太長一點。從這一部份我們知道郵船正在有冰山經過的洋面航行。我們知道那實業家郎柏的女人在瞞着伊丈夫和人通姦。我們並知道那歌人是一個怯弱男子而那滑稽脚色是一個命運論者。最後我們還知道船長在感着不安。</p>

<p>任佩眞說時。。把面前一杯白蘭地。。端起來猛力一喝。。差不多又喝乾了。。綠漪早看清在那裏。。又給伊斟上了一滿杯。。左詩晨知道任佩眞近來很不得意。。雖然混了一陣子丶也沒有混到一個地位。。那班所謂女偉人也者。。又鬧了不少的笑話。。有許多人。。老把他們作爲開玩笑的資料。。以爲女人也想出頭露面。。眞是不知自量。。因此他們弄得到處碰釘子。。這一回到上海來。不知有又什麼勾當。。伊剛纔所說的話。可見全是所發的一腔牢騷。。這個時候。。正是鬧着國體間題。。有一班人擁戴了袁凱亭要恢復帝制。。上海地方。。有不少的偵探。。潛伏在各處。。左詩晨恐怕任佩眞幾杯白蘭地下了肚。。乘着一時的酒興。。說出那種不知忌諱的話來。。向綠漪丟了一個眼色。。敎伊不要再給伊斟酒丶綠漪却見伊喝快。。便也斟得快。。正在心中發急的當兒。。恰巧有個救星來了。。你道是誰。。便是這位老林黛玉。。伊一進門。。便說道。。阿呀。。對不住。。眞眞對不住。。來得太遲了。。那一位老爺姓任的。。孫企雷指引道。。便是那位任先生。。老林黛玉的眼光。。跟着孫企雷指頭閃過去一看。。却先是一怔。。因想這是個男人。。還是個女人呢丶伊所穿的那件袍子。。的確是男人的。。伊的面孔。。也有些男子化。。就只頭上高高的梳了一個髻。。那就决不是男人了。。正在猶豫之際。。左詩晨便又加上一句道丶那位是任女士。。雖然是一位女士。。伊是一向滯落不覊。。也和我們男人一樣。。而且那位任先生。。還</p>
<p>是一位革命女傑。。從前親帶了一隊女子革命軍。。從千軍萬馬中過來的。。老林黛玉是何等垂覺的人。。只要左詩晨這幾句履歷一背。。伊完全明白。。知道這位不男不女的人。。一定是所謂女革命黨了。。吃堂子飯的人。全靠一張嘴要活絡。。敷衍人終不會錯的。。但是伊想稱呼伊什麼呢。。論伊的年紀。也可以稱伊一聲太太。。只不知道伊正式嫁了人沒有。也許伊還是一位小姐。。我呼了伊太太。。不是要吃耳光嗎丶。。若然稱伊爲小姐。。又覺得不對。。或者伊已經是太太了。。而且那班女革命家。還很不願人家呼伊爲小姐。。以爲小姐兩字是貴族式的稱呼呢。。不要說女子。。男人們也改了稱呼。。從前來抄局帳。。都寫着某大人某老爺。現往不是也改了某先生某君了嗎。。</p>

<p>Nanjing financial circles say that the talk of an American loan to China began in August of last year, initiated by a group of American industrialists and consortia. At that time, because China's war situation had stabilized, and there was a current lack of funds, it was proposed to use the excess money in the American market to develop the Chinese market profitably. When the group's senior advisor Lin Bai Ke returned to the United States last winter, he made some suggestions to the authorities on this matter, but it is difficult to prove whether Lin was directly responsible for this mission. The Chinese financial authorities have not yet received an accurate report on this matter, and are treating it as speculation. China can originally use foreign investment, but the important principles are: 1. Joint development of industry and commerce, 2. Management rights must belong to China, 3. Regarding land enterprises, full consideration must be given. Based on this principle, the acceptance or rejection of foreign capital must be decided by the highest leaders before it can become a reality. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping, the League of Nations proposed a large loan of 100 million pounds, and sent Sould to China to investigate. Important figures from American and French banks said that it is difficult to determine whether China can accept this loan. If gold is lent to China, increasing the amount of gold in the Chinese market, the price of silver can be greatly increased. If all silver is handed over to China, it will make the price of silver fall further. Newspapers in Pingjin said that Song suddenly returned to Beijing last night, which may be related to this matter. Last night, someone asked Song about the large loan of 100 million pounds. Song said that he had heard about it, but did not know the details. (18th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Tianjin, Wang Jiexia, the director of the Ping Municipal Education Bureau, returned to Ping on the morning of the 18th. Before his departure, he told reporters that Chongguan subsidizes elementary and middle school expenses of 56,000 yuan per month. The pass has been abolished and the funding is not available. The city of Ping belongs to the Executive Yuan, and the Hebei Provincial Government does not care about this. Zhang Xueliang is extremely concerned about this and ordered Jing Youyan, a special commissioner of the Ministry of Finance, to find a solution. Jing said that after the provinces in North China abolished Likin, local income decreased. Military, political, and educational expenses all depend on the subsidy from the Special Commissioner's Office. This matter still needs to wait for the Ministry of Finance to make overall plans before a decision can be made. However, the expenses of elementary and middle schools in Ping City are of great importance, and Jing has agreed to borrow and advance 56,000 yuan per month, which can be received at the end of the month.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Germany Encourages Commercial Competition</h3>
<p>The German government has ordered that retail merchants do not have to abide by the retail prices set by wholesalers in order to break the monopoly of industry associations, intending to encourage commercial competition and reduce prices. However, according to a Berlin dispatch, the total income of German retail commerce in 1930 decreased by 3 million marks compared with the previous year, and the quantity of goods sold was almost the same as the previous year, meaning that prices have already decreased. The German government is still ordering retail merchants to freely set prices because German prices have been too high in recent years, and people's purchasing power has been weakening. Therefore, although prices have decreased, they are not yet sufficient to meet the needs of society. The German government is investigating the reasons, believing that the failure to greatly reduce prices is due to the monopoly of industry associations, so it wants to break the practice of industry associations manipulating prices and give retail small businesses the opportunity to develop freely, which is not necessarily a method of encouraging commercial competition. However, considering the current state of the world today, trade is so depressed, and the people's strength is so exhausted that no one cares about things that are slightly expensive. In order to maintain business, wholesalers will also have no way to monopolize. The so-called industry associations will inevitably carefully consider the situation and will not blindly hold on to benefit themselves. On the retail side, although they can compete with lower prices, there are cost factors, so they cannot lower prices too much, resulting in losses. In short, under the current economic conditions, it is very difficult to find a way to develop business, and it may not be effective by reducing prices alone. Moreover, there are various relationships involved in reducing prices, which cannot be forced by a government order.</p>

<p>Nanjing, adopting the gold standard, there must be good methods for determining and unifying currency. Sichuan is a major obstacle to the unification of currency.

Once it reaches another army's defense area, it becomes scrap copper. Therefore, in order to unify the currency system, it is necessary to completely destroy the miscellaneous coins of the Sichuan army.

<p>Likely to Spark Disputes Among Nations</p>
<p>London, 17th - A dispatch from the Daily Telegraph commenting on the League of Nations Administrative Conference states that the political atmosphere in Geneva is on the verge of a major upheaval. In addition to the dispute over minority ethnic groups in Poděbrady, there is also the issue of mandated territories, which may also be triggered by Britain's proposal to abandon its mandate over Iraq and elevate it to League of Nations membership, causing widespread unrest. This proposal offers a great opportunity for Germany and Italy to advance their long-held claims and is expected to spark demands for the re-allocation of mandated territories. Furthermore, France, unwilling to relinquish its mandate over Syria, will also vehemently oppose Britain's move to prevent Syria from following suit and demanding independence.</p>

<h3>German Government Encourages Commercial Competition</h3>

<p>Berlin, 17th - The German government today ordered that retailers are not required to adhere to the retail prices set by wholesalers, except for those prices that are more than 10% lower than those in July of last year. This measure is intended to break the monopoly of trade associations and encourage commercial competition, thereby reducing prices.</p>

<h3>US Senate Convenes</h3>
<p>Passes Amendment to Interior Department Appropriations Bill</p>
<p>Associated Press, 17th - Washington: The Senate convened today with only 50 members present, but still passed an amendment to the Interior Department appropriations bill proposed by Democratic Senator Robinson. This is an unprecedented move. The amendment stipulates a special appropriation of $25 million to be used by the Red Cross to purchase food to relieve farmers affected by the drought. The Congressional relief bill passed this week stipulates an appropriation of $45 million to be loaned to farmers affected by the disaster to purchase seeds, fertilizers, and agricultural machinery, but does not mention food and fuel. The Senate's sudden passage of Robinson's amendment while forty senators were absent caused astonishment. Therefore, the Senate subsequently resolved to continue considering Robinson's amendment on Monday. Robinson is also very determined, saying that if Congress does not immediately implement his amendment, he will obstruct the passage of the Interior Department appropriations bill and force Congress to convene a special session this summer.</p>

<h3>Handover of Tianjin Belgian Concession Completed</h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The Tianjin Belgian Concession was designated to be administered by Belgium under the Sino-Belgian Special Agreement of 1902 (i.e., the 27th year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty). During the era of the Beijing government, the Belgian side proposed returning it, but it was shelved due to political changes. In the past year, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government dispatched plenipotentiary representatives Ling Bing and others to Tianjin to negotiate with the Belgian representatives for several months, and finally signed the agreement on the return of the Belgian Concession on August 31 in Tianjin. Now, the said agreement has been ratified by the governments of both countries, and the handover ceremony was scheduled to be held at the Tianjin Belgian Concession Engineering Bureau on the 15th of this month. Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting personally traveled north from Beijing to participate in order to draw public attention, and arrived in Tianjin the day before yesterday with Xu Mo, Director of the European and American Affairs Department, Diao Minqian, Director of the Intelligence Department, and more than ten others, and stayed at the Yuzhong Hotel in the French Concession. Belgian Ambassador Huaro was also in Tianjin that day from Beijing. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs also appointed Zang Qifang, acting mayor of Tianjin, as the commissioner for the reception of the Belgian Concession, and the reception ceremony was held today (the 15th) at 11:00 am. The Belgian ambassador was unable to attend the ceremony due to illness (according to reports, the Belgian ambassador suddenly fell seriously ill after arriving in Tianjin, first consulted with German doctor Junger, and then summoned Dr. Kerly from Beijing to Tianjin. His wife also arrived in Tianjin yesterday afternoon to check on his condition, reportedly a heart condition). He was represented by Belgian Consul General Stanness in Tianjin. There were three to four hundred Chinese and foreign guests present, and no less than several thousand citizens attended. The files of the former Belgian Engineering Bureau and its administrative agencies have been inspected and collected by the authorities, and temporarily placed under the administration of the Third District of the Special Zone. The reception ceremony included: (1) Opening meeting, (2) Playing music, (3) Speech by the Belgian representative, (4) Lowering the flag (Belgian flag) and playing Belgian music, (5) Raising the flag (Chinese flag) and playing Chinese music, (6) All guests bowing once to the Chinese and Belgian flags, (7) Speech by the Chinese representative, (8) Playing music (9) Photography (10) Closing meeting. This ceremony was determined by Minister Wang after consulting with the Belgian side after arriving in Tianjin. In the fourth item, after the Belgian national flag is lowered, the fifth item is to raise the Chinese national flag. At the same time, the Belgian flag and the Chinese flag are still raised together to show friendly relations. Tomorrow, only the Chinese national flag will be hung. The flags used today are all newly made, and the flag is larger than the commonly used one in order to make it look spectacular. The speeches of the Chinese and Belgian representatives at the meeting and the original letters of exchange are recorded as follows.</p>
<p>Speech by the Belgian Representative Belgian Representative Stanness delivered a speech in French, saying: "Your Excellency, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the National Government of the Republic of China, Your Excellency, Commissioner for the Reception of the Belgian Concession in Tianjin, Honorable Officials, Belgian Minister Huaro, representing the Belgian government, has previously informed the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the National Government of the Republic of China that the clauses of the agreement on the return of the Belgian Concession in Tianjin, which was agreed upon on August 31, 1929, have now been approved by the Belgian government and formally returned. Today, the Consul General, representing the Belgian government, formally returns the Belgian Concession in Tianjin to Commissioner Zang for reception, and the Tianjin Municipal Government of China will exercise the power of governance in the future. The Consul General is extremely pleased that Minister Wang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is participating in this meeting for the return of the Belgian Concession in Tianjin. Looking back at the time of the 1929 meeting for the return agreement, Minister Wang provided much support. At that time, the agreement was signed by Mr. Ling on the Chinese side and Mr. Ji on the Belgian side, under the auspices of Minister Wang, so it was possible to witness its completion. On the occasion of this grand ceremony, Belgian Minister Huaro came to Tianjin from Beijing the day before yesterday to prepare to attend as a representative of the Belgian government, but fell ill yesterday and was unable to attend in person, which is very regrettable. This Consul General notes that in 1927, Belgian Minister Huaro had already expressed the sincerity of returning the concession to the Chinese government. Within the concession area, except for private property rights, all permanent lease rights enjoyed by Belgium in 1902 have been completely revoked. Today is the day of the handover ceremony of the concession for the friendship between China and Belgium. Mr. Huaro should have participated in the grand event. On behalf of the Belgian government, in front of the Minister of Foreign Affairs and all officials, the Consul General formally returns the Tianjin Belgian Concession completely to the National Government. All files and other documents are requested to be checked by the reception commissioner. This is what I look forward to. I hereby deliver this speech."</p>
<p>Speech by the Chinese Representative Chinese Reception Commissioner Zang Qifang delivered a speech on behalf of the Chinese government, saying: "The Belgian government sincerely returns the Tianjin Concession to China for management. Today, I am representing the Chinese government to participate in this grand ceremony, and I am extremely honored. The Belgian representative has just described the details of the return of the concession in detail. Our side expresses great sympathy for this friendly spirit. Since the establishment of the National Government, Belgium is truly the first country to automatically return concession land, and we express our deep gratitude. At the same time, I am even more touched by three kinds of feelings: (1) Since Belgium has returned the Tianjin Concession, the relationship between China and Belgium will surely become closer day by day. (2) The return of the Tianjin Belgian Concession is based on the spirit of equality, and we especially hope that this spirit will be expanded and applied to all countries in the world. If all countries cooperate in this spirit, then unequal things will naturally not occur, and world peace can be maintained forever. (3) My hope is not an ideal. For the sake of human peace, I hope that the great powers will realize this. Today, Belgium's automatic return of the Tianjin Concession opens a new era on the principle of equality, and it is truly a new era in the relationship between China and Belgium." After the speech, Duan Yilan, Director of the Telephone Bureau, translated it into French.</p>
<p>Exchange of Official Letters Before the meeting, Belgian Ambassador sent a representative, Stanness, to deliver the official letter of exchange to Minister Wang's residence at the Yuzhong Hotel at 9:00 am. Both parties signed and exchanged the letters, with China and Belgium each keeping a copy. The content briefly stated that the agreement signed by China and Belgium in Tianjin on August 31 of the 18th year of the Republic of China on the recovery of the Tianjin Belgian Concession has been approved by the government of this country. In accordance with Article 7 of the said agreement, the agreement shall come into effect from the time of mutual notification of ratification. Therefore, the handover ceremony of the concession was held at 11:00 am this morning (the 15th).</p>
<h3>Reasons Why Shanxi Generals Remain in Tianjin Without Returning</h3>
<p>Financial Problems Still Unresolved</p>
<p>Shanxi People Oppose Retaining Four Armies</p>
<p>Beijing Correspondence: More than a dozen generals of the Shanxi-Feng army, including Shang Zhen, Xu Yongchang, and Song Zheyuan, have been staying in Tianjin for a month and a half, and have not returned for a long time, purely because the financial problems have not been resolved and there is no way to return. Since Song Ziwen's arrival in Tianjin, Shang Zhen has met with him three times at banquets and tea parties at the Zhang residence, and each time he mentioned the financial and military expenses of Shanxi. He also visited Song twice alone, and ordered Qiu Yantian, Director of the Shanxi Provincial Finance Department, to visit Song twice. Because Shang holds the position of Chairman of Shanxi Province, all issues related to military pay, reducing the burden on the people, and the business community's request to maintain the Shanxi currency are concentrated on him, and he knows that his responsibility is heavier than any general, so he is even more anxious than others. When Song Ziwen arrived in Tianjin, he first told the press that he was here to inspect the situation of abolishing likin in the north, and was not responsible for the military aftermath of Shanxi and other provinces, which clearly indicated his attitude. Later, Shang and Qiu and others repeatedly spoke with Song, who also answered with this intention, saying that the central government's finances are also very tight, and the reorganization of the army requires a large amount of money, so the issuance of 60 million rolls of cigarette bonds is an act of necessity. In fact, even 60 million is still a concern that it will not be enough, and there is no surplus to help Shanxi. Moreover, in the past, when the central government's finances were ample, it had repeatedly helped Yan Xishan, but unexpectedly, Yan used it to expand his military equipment and resist the central government, regardless of Shanxi's finances, resulting in the current financial chaos and the people's livelihood being difficult, which is truly regrettable. After Shang and others repeatedly pleaded, and strongly stated that they are determined to disarm now, but with as many as 70,000 to 80,000 people being disarmed, the money needed is by no means a small number. Shanxi Province has really no way to raise funds. If the central government cannot allocate funds, they can only request that the previously approved 24 million Shanxi financial bonds be allowed to be issued at this time, and request the Ministry of Finance to find a way to sell most of them in Shanghai, Hankou, Tianjin, and other places, and the Shanxi Provincial Finance Department to sell a part locally to meet the urgent need. The situation was very earnest. At the same time, they asked Zhang Xueliang to mediate with Song. Song was reluctantly persuaded to submit it to the Central Political Conference, saying that all bond issuances by the Ministry of Finance must first be reviewed and approved by the Central Political Conference, and he really has no right to approve it. This issue seems to have come to a temporary halt, but it is still difficult to predict whether the Central Political Conference will pass it at the original amount without reducing it, and even if it is passed, it may not be able to be sold and converted into cash immediately. The current situation of the army's reorganization cannot be delayed, so it is necessary to raise short-term funds to meet the urgent needs. Therefore, Shang and others discussed with Zhang Xueliang again. Zhang generously agreed to take out a portion of the 800,000 yuan that Song brought (about half) to temporarily serve as the disarmament fee for the Shanxi-Feng army. On one hand, in response to Shang and others' request, he ordered Jing Youyan, the special envoy of Hebei Finance, to contact the banking community in Tianjin and Beijing together with Qiu Yantian, Director of the Shanxi Provincial Finance Department, to borrow 1 million yuan in short-term loans, using a certain tax revenue from Shanxi Province as collateral. However, the banking community believes that the current situation in Shanxi is chaotic, and it is necessary to investigate first whether the collateral is reliable, so it is difficult to conclude the transaction in the short term. However, the 400,000 to 500,000 yuan given by Zhang has been received by Shang Zhen, Xu Yongchang, Fu Zuoyi, Yang Aiyuan, and Song Zheyuan, Pang Bingxun, Sun Dianying and other seven generals, who have each signed their names. Among them, the four Shanxi generals received about two-thirds of the total amount, but Shang, Xu, Fu, and Yang all believed that this small amount was far from enough to cover the current disarmament fee, and the internal affairs of the Shanxi army were complicated, with too many monks and too little porridge, and it was even more difficult to distribute it upon returning. They then sent telegrams to Li Fuying, Sun Chu, Zhang Huizhao, Zhao Chengzhou, and other division commanders to come to Tianjin together and distribute it in person. At the same time, they also discussed the candidates for the division and brigade commanders below the four army commanders, so that they could be submitted to Zhang Xueliang to forward to the central government for appointment after the decision was made (the previously determined ones have been changed). It is still unknown whether Li, Sun, and others will come, but the Shanxi Post-Disaster Relief Association, which was organized by the people of Shanxi, has actively opposed the Shanxi army still retaining four armies, and has telegraphed the Central Party Headquarters and the Chiang-Zhang Commanders-in-Chief to express their views.

<h3>The Problem of Abolishing the Chao-Hai Customs Outposts</h3>
<p>Outposts within Fifty Li to Be Temporarily Retained</p>
<p>Various Outposts Beyond Fifty Li to Be Considered for Merger</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Shantou is a major commercial port along the coast of Guangdong Province. Since the government issued an order to abolish likin, the Shantou Chaozhou Likin General Bureau was abolished on New Year's Day. At the same time, ten sub-factories such as Meixi Anbu have also stopped collecting all likin taxes. It is heard that the Chaozhou Prefecture Tax and Chao-Hai Customs are also to be abolished. However, collection has continued for days, causing merchants to be suspicious. Luo Zongmeng, the Superintendent of Chao-Hai Customs, returned to Shantou from the province on the 6th. Customs Commissioner Sadu'an made a special trip to the Superintendent's Office yesterday to discuss the issue of merging the regular customs outposts. According to the Superintendent's Office, of the nineteen outposts under its direct jurisdiction beyond fifty li, from Xiaoping Fujian border Zhaolin to Renzhan, Huizhou, three have stopped collecting taxes since New Year's Day: (1) Fu Guan Kou, (2) Donglong, (3) Huanggang. Others continue to collect taxes because the Superintendent's Office has not received a clear order to abolish the regular customs outposts. Furthermore, according to a certain foreign staff member of Chao-Hai Customs, the customs received a telegram from the Chief Inspector of Customs, Meilehe, on the 2nd, stating that from New Year's Day this year, all imported foreign goods will be taxed according to the newly promulgated tariff, and at the same time, the half-tax on goods transported inland will be abolished. The agencies collecting this half-tax include seven locations within fifty li, namely Chaoyang, Jieyang, Chenghai, Haimen, Meixi, Anbu, and Dahao, which are directly under the Chao-Hai Customs Commissioner. The nineteen outposts beyond fifty li are still managed by the Customs Superintendent's Office. Now the Chief Inspector of Customs' telegram only states that the half-tax on foreign goods transported inland should be stopped, without specifying whether the seven outposts within fifty li should be abolished, or whether they should still be retained to assist the Chao-Hai Customs. It is heard that Customs Commissioner Sadu'an dispatched personnel to various outposts on the 6th to conduct on-site investigations in order to determine the direction of abolition and merger.

<h3>Operating Conditions of the Jiaoji Railway Last Year</h3>
<p>Annual Revenue and Expenditure Roughly Balanced</p>
<p>Regular Freight Rate Conference to Be Held</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: The Jiaoji Railway, since its recovery, was in a war zone for the first time last year, which greatly affected its operations. Fortunately, the war stopped in the second half of the year, traffic resumed, and operations gradually improved. According to Tan Shukui, the director of the railway's traffic department, the total revenue of the railway last year was 12.7 million yuan, an increase of more than 2 million yuan compared to the previous year. If it weren't for the two months of suspended operation due to the war, it could have generated 15 million yuan. The war losses, including bridges, amounted to more than 2 million yuan. Of the 12.7 million yuan in revenue last year, operating expenses were approximately 8 million yuan (i.e., the entire railway's expenses), capital expenditures were more than 1 million yuan (purchasing 100 new cars and repairing bridges, etc.), and the annual interest payment on Japanese debt was 2.4 million yuan (Japanese yen). Due to the soaring price of gold last year, this amounted to approximately 4 million yuan in national currency. The total expenditure was approximately 13 million yuan. The annual revenue and expenditure balanced out. The estimated revenue for this year is 15 million yuan. The railway is in dire need of locomotives. It originally had 108 locomotives, but lost 18 last year. It lost 452 freight cars, 40 passenger cars, and 1 special car, for a total of 493 cars. They are currently distributed on the Longhai, Pinghan, and Jinpu railways, and efforts are being made to recover them. The railway currently has 90 locomotives, 1,518 passenger and freight cars, including 179 passenger cars, 1,326 freight cars, and 13 special military cars. There are 203 cars from other railways on this railway, and 493 cars from this railway on other railways. After deducting the 203 cars from other railways, this railway currently has 290 cars lost. It is estimated that if this railway is not affected by war again, its revenue next year could reach 18 million to 20 million yuan. Currently, daily revenue is approximately 40,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in order to rectify accumulated malpractices and rejuvenate railway administration, the railway has specifically scheduled a freight rate consultation meeting to be held at the Qingdao General Bureau from the 23rd of this month. Representatives from various businesses along the line will be summoned to the bureau on different days to discuss improvements in transportation and to widely solicit merchants' grievances in order to understand the advantages and disadvantages and set standards for rectification and improvement. The schedule for the bureau to convene various industries for meetings is as follows: January 23rd, convening the timber and match industries; January 24th, the peanut and peanut oil industries; January 26th, the cotton and cotton yarn industries; January 27th, the cloth and silk industries; January 28th, the silk and pottery industries; January 29th, the egg and cattle industries; January 30th, the transit and salt industries; January 31st, the tobacco and cigarette industries; February 2nd, the food and flour industries; February 3rd, the kerosene and coal industries; February 4th, the sugar and exchange industries.

<h3>Qin Qinglin and Sun Jingtai's Troops Disbanded</h3>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: The Provisional 4th Division of Qin Qinglin, stationed in Ningling, Eastern Henan, and the New 27th Division of Sun Jingtai, stationed in Shuyang, which belongs to Haizhou, are both miscellaneous troops hastily organized during the military period, and their military discipline is poor. They have now been disarmed and disbanded. According to what has been heard here, it is described as follows:</p>
<p>The disarmament of Qin Qinglin's troops in Ningling was ordered by Liu Zhi and executed by Li Yunji's division, assisted by the New 20th Division of Gao Ziju and the 1st Cavalry Brigade of Zhang Qiao. Li's division was originally stationed in Chenliu and was transferred to Guide. On New Year's Day, Li invited Qin to a banquet in Guide and immediately detained him. At the same time, he dispatched troops to Ningling to surround Qin's troops. Qin's division headquarters was located in Ningling, with a separate independent regiment stationed in Xiang Gou Ji, and a brigade stationed in Zhang Gong Ji. Gao and Zhang's troops launched simultaneously. Qin's troops in Ningling resisted in the city (at 5 AM on the 5th), but eventually lost their leader. There was looting in many places within the city and they fled north. They were disarmed by the 23rd Division in pursuit and by the troops stationed along the Longhai Railway. Several hundred guns and two mountain guns were seized in the city. The independent regiment in Xiang Gou Ji was also disarmed by a detachment of the 23rd Division. The brigade in Zhang Gong Ji opened fire and fled towards Zhecheng. They were pursued by the 23rd Division, blocked by the 20th Division of Gao Ziju in Taikang, and ambushed by the cavalry division of Zhang Qiao in the Pinggang area of Shunhe Ji. More than 900 people were disarmed and taken in, and 400-500 guns were seized. All were sent to Zhecheng and supervised by a detachment of the 23rd Division, and then sent back to their hometowns with travel expenses. Ningling is currently handling the aftermath.</p>
<p>Sun Jingtai's troops in Shuyang were originally bandits from Baodu Mountain. It is said that Sun's real name was Mei Song, and he was the younger brother of Sun Meiyao. After being stationed in Shuyang, they continued to engage in kidnapping. This time, the disarmament was executed by Liang Guanying's troops, ordered by the Jiangsu Pacification Superintendent's Office. Liang's troops marched to Shuyang on the 12th. The troops surrounding Shuyang City were the 95th Brigade of Liu Guoming. However, during the pacification meeting, Zhang detained Sun's attending representative. Sun's troops, upon hearing the news, were already prepared. On the evening of the 13th, they robbed the Shuyang City Public Security Bureau of its guns and fled east out of the city. In addition to dispatching his own troops to block the key points, Liang Guanying, the division commander, also deployed the cavalry division of Zhang Huatang, which had been transferred to Jiangbei, to ambush them. The 12th Division of Jin Handing, stationed in Donghai and along the Longhai Railway, also blocked the railway line. The 95th Brigade has now entered and is stationed in Shuyang City, while dispatching troops in pursuit and defending the city. However, when Sun's troops fled, they took the telegraph bureau's machinery with them, causing Shuyang's communications to be cut off. It is currently being repaired. Sun himself and the division headquarters were originally stationed in Shuyang, but fled upon receiving the news. The Shuyang area is currently handling the aftermath and order will be restored soon.

<p>Ye Yixiong Narrates the Facts of His Experience</p>
<p>I knew that Ms. Zhang had a friend named Liu before. I asked her several times, and Ms. Zhang said she had no feelings for him and had broken off the relationship. At the time, I deeply believed it. But when I opened the box in the car, I found many love letters in it, most of them from Liu. As soon as I saw them, my jealousy erupted, and I couldn't contain my anger. Later, I saw a letter written by Ms. Zhang to Liu, the words were very intimate, and there was a circle drawn with a dot in the middle, indicating a mooncake, with the words "This mooncake is about to be in your mouth." After reading it, I was already furious. At that time, I was inside the house, and Ms. Zhang was sitting outside smoking, so she didn't know. I thought about how much energy and effort I had spent on her, but now she was looking for someone else. The more I thought about it, the angrier I got. For a moment I was disheartened, and I had the idea of harming her. When I came out of the house, Ms. Zhang saw my face and felt that I was unhappy. She asked me, and I changed the subject. When I got to the train station, I tricked her off the train. Unexpectedly, next to the warehouse, she was tripped by a small pit. At that time, my anger had soared, and I took out my pistol and shot her. I didn't kill her at the time. Seeing her injured, I felt sorry for her. I wanted to go up and coax her, but I thought it wasn't something that could be solved with a punch and a kick and a few kind words. Just at this moment, I suddenly heard someone shouting, so I fled and squatted behind the latrine. After a while, I heard many people rescuing her. I was just angry for a moment, and later I knew it was wrong. If I wanted to escape, I would have left. Because I was worried about her, I still wanted to go back to Harbin to find out the news. At that time, the draft was originally with me, but because someone rescued Ms. Zhang, I was afraid that if I said it, someone would search for it, so I hid the draft. When the second train passed, I went to the station, walking back and forth, intending to ask about Ms. Zhang's condition. Later, a patrol officer came over and asked me if I was Japanese. I said no. The patrol officer said, "Please come into the room and talk." So I followed him to the patrol officer's office. Officer Wu asked me if I was Ye Yixiong who killed Zhang Liqing. I admitted it and drew a confession at the time. This is the true story of the past, and it was just a moment of confusion at the time. I regret it very much. As for saying that it was murder for money, that is not the case. Think about it, Ms. Zhang's money was often in my possession, and I didn't kill her. How could I have such an intention for such a small amount of money? Besides, my family is also able to live well. My brother and my woman can earn several hundred yuan a month. I also have savings, and my family has property. Why would I risk my life to seize other people's property? It's just that I lack personal morality. I ask the presiding judge and everyone to examine the places that should be paid attention to in detail. I would be very grateful. It's a pity that Ms. Zhang didn't come today. If I asked her, she could understand whether what I said was true."</p>
<p>After Ye Yixiong finished speaking, the judge continued to interrogate Ye: (Judge asks) "The facts you said are very detailed. You were sitting in the car. Because you were wearing a lot of clothes, you changed clothes. When you opened the box, you saw the love letters with the words about eating mooncakes, and you became jealous. So you had the temporary intention to kill her, drove her off the train, and shot her behind the second warehouse, right?" (Answer) "Yes." (Judge asks) "But the original confession said that you were dizzy. You said that the train stopped at the station for sixty minutes, so you could go down and play. There is another station ahead. The train will load goods there. This station has scenic spots. We can go down and see, and then get on the train at that station. So you walked north along the narrow-gauge railway from the water tower to the second warehouse, which is north of the Russian cemetery, and pushed Zhang Liqing down and shot her. According to this, it doesn't match what you just said. According to you, it was entirely because of jealousy, right?" (Answer) "Yes." (Judge asks) "How far is it from getting off the second-class car to the Russian cemetery near the narrow-gauge railway?" (Answer) "I don't remember." (Judge asks) "Regarding the facts of this case, according to the confession recorded by the Shuangcheng patrol officer, you said that you were still friends. Because the train left after getting off the train, you chased the train together and slipped in the snow, and the pistol went off, so you injured someone. Now, according to what you said, it doesn't match the original confession." (Answer) "Yes. Last time, I didn't want outsiders to know about our relationship, so I confessed like that. Now that the situation inside is completely known outside, I can't hide it anymore, so I told the whole story." (Judge asks) "If you say it wasn't for money, why did you hide the draft in your trouser leg when you were at the Russian cemetery after the shooting?" (Answer) "At that time, I was just reckless for a moment. Later, I thought that Ms. Zhang was injured and would definitely say it, and it would be inconvenient if someone searched for it. I was worried, so I hid the draft so I could come out and find out about Zhang Liqing's news." (Judge asks) "Where did you put the draft originally?" (Answer) "The draft was in my coat pocket, and the change was in my cloak pocket." (Judge asks) "You put it very securely, why did you move it to your trouser leg?" (Answer) "It was to avoid being searched, so I hid it." (Judge asks) "If you say you committed murder out of jealousy, why didn't you call the police after the incident and rescue Zhang, but instead ran to the latrine and froze all night?" (Answer) "I was panicked and didn't know what to do. When I was about to report, I heard someone coming to rescue her, so I didn't dare to show my face." (Judge asks) "What time did you get to the station after the murder?" (Answer) "I don't remember. I only know that the second train was coming soon." (Judge asks) "Were you going back to Harbin?" (Answer) "I was going back to Harbin to find out about Ms. Zhang's situation." (Judge asks) "According to the original patrol, you said your surname was Zhang?" (Answer) "I didn't. I don't know how the original case would write the surname Zhang." (Judge asks) "When did you buy your gun?" (Answer) "A long time ago, when I was studying at a Russian school." (Judge asks) "Where did you buy it?" (Answer) "At a Japanese gun shop on South 14th Street, China Street." (Judge asks) "About what year did you buy it?" (Answer) "About the end of the eleventh year of the Republic of China [1922]." (Judge asks) "Did you know Zhang Liqing before or after the Double Tenth Festival [October 10]?" (Answer) "I knew her before, but not well." (Judge asks) "Was it hot on the train?" (Answer) "Yes." (Judge asks) "When did Zhang come to Harbin? Did a relationship develop between you?" (Answer) "She came to Harbin a long time ago. A relationship developed." (Judge asks) "Was it in the first month [of the lunar calendar]?" (Answer) "About the first month, maybe." (Judge asks) "From the Double Tenth Festival the year before last to the first month of last year, was that the first time?" (Answer) "Yes, the first time." (Judge asks) "Before Zhang came from Beiping [Beijing], were there any letters?" (Answer) "There were often letters." (Judge asks) "Where did she live in the first month?" (Answer) "She lived at the Huang's house." (Judge asks) "When did you fall in love?" (Answer) "After coming to Harbin, we were very close. She asked me to do many things." (Judge asks) "Was it in February or March?" (Answer) "I don't remember." (Judge asks) "When did she give you a love letter?" (Answer) "I don't remember." (Judge asks) "Is this the letter?" (The judge reads) "Dear [blank], I'm leaving if you don't come back. Fortunately, we are friends, so you won't blame me. I'll see you again at twelve o'clock tomorrow. Afternoon, the 19th, Love." When was this written?" (Answer) "After we became close." (Judge asks) "What is the meaning of writing 'Love' at the end?" (Answer) "I don't know." (Judge asks) "In the first month, did Zhang live in the Beijing Hotel?" (Answer) "She first lived at the Huang's house, then the Beijing Hotel, and then moved to the Xie Xing Sauce Garden. Because it was inconvenient, she deposited items worth 15,000 yuan with me. She lived in the Xie Xing Sauce Garden for three months, and then moved out." (Judge asks) "When did she move out?" (Answer) "The summer was almost over." (Judge asks) "Where did she live again?" (Answer) "She first lived at the Beijing Hotel, then moved to the Balas Hotel. At this time, I returned all the items to her." (Judge asks) "What were they?" (Answer) "Savings passbook, seal, precious items, etc." (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Harbin Merchants Request Purchase of North Manchurian Soybeans</h3>
<p>Harbin Dispatch. After the Harbin organs and organizations resolved the relief of Harbin's commercial plan on the 9th of this month in the 　Wang Chamber of Commerce Conference, the seven organizations including the Dao Nei and Wai Chambers of Commerce, Banks, Money Shops, Grain Shops, Fire Mills, and Grain Exchange, which were promoted to draft the plan, drafted it at the Binjiang Chamber of Commerce at noon on the 10th. On the 11th at 11 am, the organizations met at the Chamber of Commerce to revise the draft article by article, and recommended Zhang Tingge, the chairman of the Dao Nei Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and Li Mingyuan, the chairman of the Dao Wai County Chamber of Commerce, to meet with Zhang Jinghui, the special district executive officer, at noon on the 12th, and presented the draft to seek the opinions of the government. If the draft is considered appropriate, another meeting will be held this week to determine the representatives to go to Shenyang and Jilin to request the authorities to approve the handling. The draft is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Reasons: The price of soybeans this year has fallen drastically, and exports have been stagnant, which has never happened before. The income of farmers in Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces, who have worked hard all year round, after deducting the land rent shared by the landlords and all the expenses of local donations and taxes, the net profit is not enough to pay for wages. This year, it will be impossible to end the year, and next year, there will be no power to cultivate. The lifeline of farmers and merchants in North Manchuria will be cut off because of this. If we do not urgently seek relief, the farmers will have no food or clothing, and the merchants will suffer unbearable losses. If they take risks, it is feared that it will lead to unimaginable disturbances, which will inevitably be out of control. It is proposed that the government purchase a large amount of soybeans in accordance with Japan's method of maintaining rice prices last year, so as to save the situation.</p>
<p>(B) Plan: The annual export of soybeans in North Manchuria is about 200,000 train cars. From the autumn of the 19th year [of the Republic of China] to the present, only more than 30,000 train cars have been exported. Foreign merchants, seeing the price of soybeans falling day by day, although they clearly need it, deliberately refuse to buy it. Our farmers and merchants are panic-stricken and have no way to deal with it. It is proposed to temporarily designate a bank to organize an agency for issuing special banknotes, and issue a kind of current silver banknotes common to the three provinces, the number of which is set at 50 million yuan, to buy soybeans. It is estimated that 50,000 train cars can be bought up and down. These 50 million yuan of banknotes will circulate in the market, and farmers and merchants will be able to rely on it to help. (2) Although the above-mentioned 50 million yuan of banknotes can only buy 50,000 train cars of soybeans, it also accounts for one-third of the total amount. The price of soybeans will inevitably rise. After buying in, loans can be borrowed from the bank to buy again. In this way, a total of more than 100,000 train cars can be bought, and the price of soybeans will inevitably rise sharply. Europe has always relied on our soybeans as raw materials and cannot ignore them. If we manipulate in this way, we will undoubtedly gain huge profits. (3) Soybeans are oil and food, which are not necessary for people's diet. This year's sluggish sales will naturally lead to a change in plans for next spring's planting. It is found that the population in various provinces of our mainland is surplus, and there is a lack of food. Actual investigations have shown that Japanese rice and American wheat flour are sold in our northern provinces, which is also proof of our lack of food. The geology of North Manchuria is suitable for planting wheat, corn, sorghum, oil wheat, etc. It is proposed that the local governments of Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces be ordered to persuade farmers to change to planting food crops during next spring's plowing to help the people in the inland provinces of our country, and to prevent Japanese and American rice and flour from invading. Restrictions should also be strictly imposed on soybean planters. (For example, the number of plantings should not exceed one-tenth or two-tenths of this year's planting.) In this way, the soybeans purchased this year do not have to be sold urgently, and there is a considerable use. And transporting food crops to our mainland to resist Japanese and American rice and flour is also a method of blocking loopholes. The result is no different from the previous export of soybeans to foreign countries in exchange for money. Even if foreigners do not buy soybeans, there is no loss to us. (4) This method of purchasing soybeans must be submitted to the Northeast Political Affairs Committee to designate various banks to organize a committee for purchasing soybeans to implement the purchase. All detailed procedures and methods for storing soybeans shall be separately determined by the committee on a temporary basis. (5) This banknote is only used to buy soybeans and is not allowed to be used for other purposes. The price is based on the face value, with no discount. Bankers must make unlimited remittances. It is universally used for paying taxes and transportation agencies. A cash of 15 million yuan and the purchased soybeans are raised as the foundation for the banknotes. In the future, the money from selling soybeans will be used to recover the banknotes. When the price of soybeans recovers and there is no need to maintain it, the 50 million yuan of banknotes will be recovered and scrapped. During the maintenance period, all powers and responsibilities belong to the governments of the three provinces. (6) It is requested that the Northeast Political Affairs Committee designate local agencies and legal entities to organize a supervisory committee to monitor the method of purchasing soybeans and the circulation of banknotes, and to supervise the recovery of banknotes when the price of soybeans recovers to avoid affecting finance. (7) This plan is beneficial to be implemented quickly, because the opportunity is urgent and delayed handling will inevitably be of no help. If you are invited and approved, please order various banks to temporarily use the tickets in stock that have not been issued. If the amount is checked, the supervisor shall add a special logo seal in the shortest period to identify and utilize them. (8) The sharp fall in the price of soybeans is due to our overproduction and the suppression of foreign countries. However, a detailed review shows that the unrestricted increase in the transportation cost of the East Railway is also a major reason. The transportation cost of the East Railway has always been converted from the price of gold rubles into Harbin foreign currency. Recently, due to the soaring price of gold, the converted price has also increased without restriction. The current transportation cost of the East Railway is more than double that of before March last year. Soybean exports must be transported by the East Railway. Buyers in North Manchuria must deduct the transportation cost of the East Railway from the price of soybeans, otherwise there will be no profit. Therefore, the price of soybeans in North Manchuria has fallen so sharply. Otherwise, the current price of soybeans in Dalian is not much lower than last year, and it can be seen that the fall in the price of soybeans in North Manchuria is mostly affected by the excessive transportation cost of the East Railway. It is proposed that the Northeast Political Affairs Committee order the East Railway to especially reduce the transportation cost of soybeans, and reduce it to the point where it does not lose money. (9) Soybeans mostly come from the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and exports must pass through South Manchuria. The national railways in the three provinces also transport a lot of soybean loads. The shipping fee and the transportation cost of the South Manchuria Railway and the national railways in the three provinces are also directly related to the price of soybeans. It is proposed that the Northeast Political Affairs Committee order the Northeast Navigation Bureau and the railway bureaus of the national railways to reduce the transportation fee for soybeans, and to negotiate with the Japanese South Manchuria Railway Company to reduce the soybean transportation cost.</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Water Police Arrest Bandits and Escort Them to Songjiang for Trial. Punanjiaoli'an Dianshan Mapeng and other places are areas where bandits on the border between Songjiang and Jinshan often appear. The year before last, Pan Baozhong, the former captain of the anti-smuggling brigade, searched and suppressed the area. After the ringleaders were captured, the area was slightly peaceful. However, since last autumn, large gangs of bandits, unable to be active in Taihu Lake, have fled into the interior. Common local ruffians are increasingly attached to them. It is said that there are two major gangs, east and west. There are also several gangs of scattered small groups, specializing in robbery. After the autumn harvest, villagers carrying several stones of rice go to the market to sell them and return home with the money they have earned. Armed bandits will definitely carry out robberies that night. Therefore, those who have a little wealth have already moved away. Even families with slightly better lives have recently moved to neighboring towns to avoid the danger, almost becoming a place of bandits, unable to live in peace. During the day, these people openly carry guns in various small market towns, and if they see someone they suspect of being a police detective, they will question them in every way. Only after a local acquaintance proves their identity will they stop. Villagers who have been robbed either because the loss is not significant or because they fear forming a feud, do not report to the government. This is also one of the reasons why the bandit forces are so rampant. Fan Guozhong, the captain of the first team of the first district of the Jiangsu Provincial Public Security Bureau, personally led eight ships to patrol the area the other day, taking the opportunity to search and arrest. He captured five bandits, Li Youtang, He Shide, Zhu Ahu, Zhang Wenhai, and Ma Axiang. After questioning them and taking their confessions, he sent them to Songjiang on the 17th to be handed over to the county government for trial. It is said that they are wanted criminals who robbed Punan and other places. They are currently under strict interrogation.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Arson Case Occurs on Jiaoji Road. The house at No. 7 Jiaoji Road outside Guangfu Gate in the county is the private property of Hou Zuolin, a resident of Yingshanhe. It has recently been rented to a Chinese medicine practitioner named Zhou, but he has not yet moved in. Therefore, the inside of the house is empty. Unexpectedly, at about 3 am last night, a fire suddenly broke out in the house, with thick smoke filling the air. Fortunately, Wang Renguan and other patrol officers from the second branch of the Public Security Bureau nearby noticed it, broke into the house, and fetched water to extinguish the fire. At that time, a person was suddenly seen escaping from the house, and a small square tin box containing flammable liquor was found inside the gate. A lot of old newspapers were also found on the stairs, with oil stains on them. Knowing that it was arson, the found evidence was taken to the bureau together for thorough investigation.</p>
<p>County Court President Formally Announced. The president and judges of the county court have not yet been formally announced. It is now known that President Lin of the High Court has ordered Yang Keqian, a native of Yixing and a current judge of the Shanghai District Court, to serve as the president and judge of the Wuxi County Court. After being commissioned, Mr. Yang went to Suzhou yesterday to thank the commissioner and is expected to come to Wuxi within a few days to take over. At the same time, President Lin also instructed County Magistrate Pan to inform him and order him to hand over the county's judicial files to Mr. Yang for acceptance, and appointed Zhu Zonghai as a candidate prosecutor, Ma Chang as the chief clerk of the prosecutor's office, Shen Guanghao as a candidate clerk of the prosecutor's office, and Gao Quwei as a clerk trainee of the prosecutor's office. However, the position of chief clerk has not yet been announced. It is also learned that Yu Jitang, the original trial officer of the county government, has also been ordered by the High Court to be promoted to candidate judge of the Zhenjiang District Court and sent to Qingjiangpu to serve.</p>
<p>Two Robbery Cases Occur in One Day. Now that it is the winter defense period, robbery cases are emerging one after another. Unexpectedly, two robbery cases occurred again yesterday in one day. One: Near Youduxiang outside the East Gate, at 9 pm last night, villagers Zhang and others, five or six people, were returning home from the city when they passed by the place. Suddenly, three or four thugs jumped out of the nearby deserted tomb, each holding a pistol, a bayonet, and other weapons, blocking Zhang's way and carrying out a search and robbery. They were stripped of their clothes and silver coins. Second: Fifth District, Tianshang City. Xia, the second son of Xia Zhenhua, a resident of Xizhang in the north, came to the city for business yesterday. After finishing his business, he returned to his hometown. When he passed the Laoyaqiao area north of Tangtou, he suddenly encountered three bandits who ordered him to stop and stepped forward to rob him. They stuffed Xia's mouth with mud to prevent him from shouting. At that time, one of the bandits had a section of his finger bitten off by Xia. He was robbed of four yuan in cash and several corner tickets.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Hupu Rice Boat Robbed. Peng Haishun, a native of Miaoqian Township, Meitang District, loaded a boat of white rice on the 13th of this month and went to Hupu to sell it. After selling it, because he had not yet received the payment, he moored on the beach under the Nanyunquan Tea House. Unexpectedly, at about 12 o'clock on the second night, three bandits suddenly climbed onto the boat with guns and robbed it. They found nothing of value. Finally, they searched Peng's belt, which contained more than 100 yuan in banknotes and three yuan in cash, and robbed it all.</p>
<p>Huang Bao Car Rental Reduced. Because of the cold and freezing weather recently, there are few passengers. In order to demand a reduction in rentals, the rickshaw pullers of the county went on strike as one. After persuasion by Supervisor Shi of the Party Department, they temporarily resumed work. It is heard that the result is that the capitalists will reduce the rent by six copper coins per car per day to show their concern.</p>
<p>The Traffic between Suzhou and Changshu Has Resumed. Since the traffic was blocked, all parties have felt inconvenienced. Since the 16th, the Suzhou-Changshu route has been completely restored. However, the traffic after a long blockage, the two morning rounds of the shipping company are extremely crowded. The Huitong Class also towed several civilian ships to carry passengers. It is heard that this traffic can be restored soon, half due to the warming weather and half due to the authorities' hiring of laborers to knock through the ice, and the cost is quite huge. Just on the Yuanhe Tang River alone, 33 silver dollars have been spent, of which the general manager of the Bank of China alone accounted for 36 yuan. (According to Zhang Gongquan, the general manager of the Bank of China, who happened to come to Changshu for sightseeing and was blocked, in order to return to Shanghai as soon as possible, he urged the authorities to knock through the ice. Therefore, in addition to subsidizing 36 yuan, he gave a reward of 200 yuan to the laborers who were suffering from knocking the ice.) The remaining numbers were allocated to each ship and managed by the Public Security Bureau. Therefore, since the 16th, the Suzhou-Changshu route has been unimpeded. On the Kun-Chang line, no ice-breaking was carried out beforehand. On the 16th, the Qingyanggang class ships planned to run as usual, but they set off at about 8 am, and before they reached ten miles, they returned as before, because there were still many places that had not yet been thawed and accessible.</p>
<h3>Pinghu</h3>
<p>Remnants of the Quanggong Pavilion Bandit Robbery. It is said that Liu Dexing, Cheng Laohu, and other fierce bandits under the command of Taibao Ashu led many bandits, stayed in the Quanggong Pavilion area, and extorted money at will. The flower shops in Quanggong Pavilion Town, such as Chenyuanxing and other seven companies, were asked for 30,000 yuan. The other companies were asked to raise thousands of yuan by themselves and pay the money within a time limit. This matter has been recorded in the previous report. It is now known that this matter was convened by someone to discuss with wealthy merchants, because the fees were too high and it was not easy to raise, so it has not been paid. In the case of the Luyang surname kidnapping in the East City Baimang, the bandits asked for 4,000 yuan, and the Lu surname only agreed to pay 500 yuan, which was later increased to 700 yuan. The bandits have not yet been obtained, and they are still allowed. According to the bandits, the hostages are now in Shantang and can be sent to see them, and they are treated very favorably. Also, Yangjiaku and Zhu Lanrong were robbed by bandits last spring, and this time they received a threatening letter from Cheng Laohu, the squad leader of the Fourth Detachment of the Songhu [Songjiang-Shanghai] area, wanting to borrow 16,000 yuan for military expenses and limited the reply to three days. Zhu has moved away with his family.</p>
<p>Rampant Bandits and Repeated Kidnapping Cases. The bandit forces in the eastern countryside of Pinghu have recently become more rampant, and kidnapping for ransom is heard every day. Xi Erhe's daughter, seventeen years old, of Nanyanggang Oil Cart Head in Xinhui, was robbed by bandits on the night of the 17th. More than ten bandits came in total, and after the robbery, they went northeast. Also, Bei Xia Abu of Yaqian was killed by bandits on the 15th. Liu Along's nine-year-old young son of Beitang Bridge in Xincang was also kidnapped by bandits that night. Others such as Ding Shenghe's eight-year-old son of Hanjiamiao Dingjiazhaiji was kidnapped by bandits on the night of the 16th. More than twenty bandits came in total and robbed 13 silver dollars. The bandits claimed that they needed 1,000 yuan for redemption and fired two shots before leaving.</p>

She was the concubine of a Mr. Gao, a person in the money industry, and had given birth to a son. Later, due to constant quarrels with Gao's wife, Gao hired someone to persuade Hua and gave her 2,000 silver dollars to leave, while keeping her child. Afterwards, she became involved with Zhao Hengfu, a former employee of a money shop, but later separated again. Unable to make a living, Hua was forced to return to prostitution. She deposited 1,700 silver dollars at Li Changyi's, a shareholder of the Wuzhou Hotel. She went to Beijing, but due to poor business and difficult expenses, she returned to Zhenjiang the day before yesterday and stayed at Li's place. Because she had been unable to withdraw money for days, she became resentful and secretly ingested opium. After being discovered by Li's family, she was immediately taken to Shengshou Temple in Houjie for rescue, but it was too late. Li Changyi has been detained by the Fifth Sub-bureau for interrogation.</p>

Miao was a former department director of the Ministry of Personnel in the Qing Dynasty, who had a fondness for antiques and calligraphy, and collected a wealth of items, all entrusted to the temple for safekeeping, to be used for leisure during the summer retreat. Miao passed away last winter. Unexpectedly, two people, Zhou and Ma, forged a letter from Miao's son, Shaotang, to the abbot of the temple, Shigu, requesting the antiques and calligraphy from the temple. The monks in the temple, fearing they were imposters, notified Miao's clansmen residing in the town to interrogate them. There were many suspicious points, so they immediately called the police and took Zhou and Ma to the bureau for detention. They also sent a letter to Miao's son in Yangzhou to handle the matter.</p>

<p>Zhu Mingtao Will Move to Suppress New Bandits: Chen Da Laohu (i.e., Shunchang) and Wang Yuqing, the leaders of the bandits in Sheng, after being surrounded and severely suppressed by the team led by Zhu Mingtao, the Director of the Security Office, had no way to escape. Knowing that they were caught in the net of the law, they were quite remorseful and willing to reform. They were persuaded by local impartial gentry to surrender and hand over multiple guns, including wooden-shell Browning guns, willing to perform meritorious service to atone for their crimes. Director Zhu telegraphed the provincial government for instructions, and the provincial government granted them leniency, but strictly ordered Chen and others to surrender their weapons and arrest bandits to observe their future actions. To thoroughly eliminate the source of bandits, it is planned to order the current bandit suppression troops to immediately go to the territory of Xinchang County to eliminate other bandit groups and ensure the safety of the local people.</p>

<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Commander Wang Firmly Requests Resignation: Wang Wenhan, the commander of the bandit suppression in the four counties, had repeatedly resigned from his position with the province last year. The provincial authorities repeatedly tried to retain him. Even though Commander-in-Chief Chiang issued a general order to abolish all bandit suppression command headquarters in the provinces last month, the Zhejiang Provincial Government, considering Commander Wang's outstanding achievements in bandit suppression and the early establishment of his command, decided to postpone the abolition. It is now heard that Commander Wang, believing that the rebels have been suppressed and there is no concern for security in Zhejiang, telegraphed the provincial government again yesterday, firmly requesting his resignation. It is unknown whether the provincial government will approve his resignation.</p>
<p>The Bureau Chief Should Repay the Loan: When Zhu Luzhong was the director of the Ningbo Unified Donation Bureau, he mortgaged one million yuan to the Ningbo money industry under the order of the Provincial Department. Over the past four or five years, repayments have been made, but 300,000 yuan is still owed. Now that the donation bureau has been abolished as a result of the elimination of tariffs, how should this mortgage debt be handled? The bureau chief reported to the province for instructions. The province stated that since the mortgage loan was originally negotiated by Director Zhu, Director Zhu is responsible for repayment. Zhu forwarded a report to the Finance Department yesterday seeking instructions.</p>
<p>Resolution of the Citywide Village and Li Association: The Ningbo Citywide Village and Li Association held a joint meeting of citywide village and li committees yesterday afternoon at 1 PM.

(2) After the abolition of the city, organize a Ningbo post-abolition preparation committee. The preparation committee will be composed of one person from each district with ten or fewer li, two persons from each district with more than ten li, and three persons from each district with more than twenty li, totaling fifteen persons from eight districts. A letter will be sent to each li, setting the meeting on the afternoon of the 16th to elect committee members and inform this association. The first meeting of the post-abolition preparation committee is scheduled for 1 PM on the afternoon of the 18th of this month. (3) Send a letter to the county magistrate requesting a detailed audit of all income and expenditure accounts at the time of the handover from the municipal government.</p>
<p>The Municipal Government Finds It Difficult to Conclude: The Ningbo Municipal Government, having been resolved by the provincial government to be abolished, is limited to concluding by the 15th of this month, with the Ningbo County Government taking over management. Mayor Yang ordered all bureaus and departments to conclude everything and await handover. However, the provincial government's order was delayed until yesterday before being delivered. At the same time, the Ningbo County Government also received the instruction to take over. Mayor Yang and County Magistrate Chen once negotiated and decided to comply with the order in the shortest possible time. However, the municipal government has a huge debt of educational and public security funds, as well as employee living expenses. From the past, at least 100,000 yuan is needed to resolve the situation. Therefore, although the municipal city has been abolished, its conclusion is very difficult.</p>

<p>The Northeastern University basketball team competed against Shanghai University at the Chinese Basketball Hall yesterday at 3:30 PM. This was Northeastern University's first game since arriving in Shanghai. With 300-400 spectators, Northeastern University appeared flustered at first due to unfamiliarity with the venue. In the first half, they lost to Shanghai University 7-16. Starting in the second half, Northeastern University suddenly showed its sharpness, and both offense and defense became smoother. As a result, Northeastern University reversed the defeat with a score of 34-22. The referee was Zhang Guoxun.

Shanghai University followed up, and Lu Zhonghui scored one point first. Feng Nianhua scored two points by attacking the basket for the first time. Although Northeastern University tried hard to counterattack, they had difficulty making progress due to inaccurate shooting. Instead, Shanghai University's score increased steadily, and the score was once 11-1. Northeastern University tried to improve and made some progress. The first half ended with a score of 16-7, with Shanghai University taking the lead.</p>
<h3>Northeastern University Gets Better and Better</h3>
<p>Starting in the second half, Northeastern University reorganized its forces and hoped to retaliate. Sure enough, the situation changed drastically. Fan and Ma scored repeatedly, and the connection also improved. The score suddenly became 10-15, with Northeastern University only one point behind. Later, Feng Nianhua of Shanghai University suddenly scored a goal in the crowd, and Zhao Lingzhi of Northeastern University scored a long shot, which immediately made it 18-18. Shanghai University took a time-out, and Dai Linjing brought in people and added two points.

<h3>Results of Yesterday's Inter-port Trial Match</h3>
<p>B Team Valiantly Takes Victory</p>
<p>A Team Lacks Spirit and Suffers Setback</p>
<p>| Result: A Team Wins 5-2 |</p>
<p>| Iron Gate Zhou Xianyan Can't Do It Alone |</p>
<p>The second Shanghai inter-port inspection was held at Shenyuan yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. Among the Chinese players who participated, only Zhou Xianyan was the iron gate. There were over a thousand spectators, all of whom were connoisseurs, who came to appreciate the skills of the players rather than for the outcome. The A team won one goal in the first half. The B team won five to one in the second half. As a result, the B team won 5-1. The referee was Lawton.</p>
<h3>Zhou Xianyan the Tiger Falls on the Plain</h3>
<p>The focus of the entire game was on Zhou Xianyan, the iron gate, who used his superb skills to repeatedly turn danger into safety. The most notable was at 30 minutes in the first half, when the left and right inside forwards of the B team were in front of the goal, each using fierce shots. Any goalkeeper would be flustered and at a loss in such a desperate situation. However, my iron gate Zhou Xianyan was like a hungry tiger pouncing on its prey, hitting the mark every time and escaping from death. The whole field was in an uproar. Afterwards, the two inside guards were negligent and their positions were improper. Zhou Xianyan was like a tiger falling on the plain, being played with. The loss of five goals was not Zhou's fault.</p>
<h3>Shaken Central Defense Line</h3>
<p>Ten players on Team A took the field; central defender Xu Yujia mysteriously disappeared. After five minutes, Western defender Shi Gaotuo joined as the right midfielder. In the three-man central defense line, Gu Shitai displayed prowess on all sides, performing his duties satisfactorily, while the left and right deputies were greatly disappointing. The two inside defenders were as solid as a golden city in the first half, showing great promise, but in the second half, their handling was flawed, with loopholes everywhere. The five forwards were unevenly spaced, fragmented, and uncoordinated. Individual performances were acceptable, but teamwork was lacking. Overall, with the absence of central defender Xu Yujia, morale was low, leading to a shaken defense line.</p>

<h3>United Strength Defeats Strong Enemy</h3>
<p>Looking back, Team B united its strength and bravely fought back, its interior solid, blocking others' path to advance, its exterior forwards cooperating, playing the enemy generals in the palm of their hands. Though named Team B, its actual strength was indeed above Team A. Its victory over the strong enemy was entirely due to the united effort of the entire team.</p>

<p>Bo La Tai, Fan Enshi, Xin Ke Lai</p>
<p>Ai, Lun, Tui, Le, Mi, La</p>
<p>Mao Fei</p>
<h3>Team B Bleeds as the Game Ends</h3>
<p>As the silver whistle blew, the great battle began. After several back-and-forths, Team A's right winger Fa Fanqie first displayed his prowess, strong and powerful, breaking through the encirclement and penetrating deep, shooting with one foot, hitting the goalpost. The left winger chased up, but stumbled on the field, and the momentum reversed. Team B's center forward Xin Ke Lai led the pack, coming from all directions. Mi La shot, also hitting the goalpost. Team A's left wing picked up the ball and shot in front of the goal. Fa Fanqie charged behind the goal. Team B's forwards took advantage of the situation to advance, surrounding the goal, seeking opportunities. Ge Tishi shot twice. Zhou Xianyan pushed and pounced, first escaping danger. Team A's forwards, although active many times, were not as menacing as Team B's occasional attacks. At that time, Team B's left inside forward shot twice, both hitting the goalpost. Then the left and right inside forwards came to the empty goal and shot fiercely. Zhou Xianyan was bold and careful, calmly saving the day, shaking the entire audience. Team A then started Fa Fanqie's pick up and Tou Na's smooth follow up, within five steps, Deng Fen bled. In the first half, Team A won by one goal.</p>
<h3>Losing Momentum in the Replay</h3>
<p>After the lemon break, the two teams engaged again. Within eight minutes, Jie's left wing and left inside forward each scored a goal. At that time, Team A's interior was empty, leading to attacks. Team A went on the expedition; the forwards gained momentum; the interior continued to advance, neglecting the key barriers. Once the enemy counterattacked, it was too late to rescue, leaving the goalkeeper in an isolated situation. At fifteen minutes, Team B's Ge Tishi scored another goal, making it three to one. Team A's center forward Ke Lasha passed the ball to the center. Jack dribbled in and shot, making it three to two. Team A's momentum gradually picked up. Team B's Ke once again faced the goal, but missed. Central defender Gu Sitai took advantage of the unpreparedness of the opponent and made two shots, making the enemies quite alarmed. In the last eight minutes, Xin Ke Lai rushed in and collapsed, and Hui Tuo Ma also cut in and scored. The result of the match was five to two. Team B won.</p>
<h3>Another Match May Be Needed to Select Representatives</h3>
<p>Team A's lineup was the representative in the minds of the selection committee. Yesterday's failure was due to the poor performance of the central defense line, but the inside forwards and forwards were also not optimistic. It was not as good as Team B, whose players were motivated and promising. Based on the actual situation, the Shanghai inter-port trial match may need to be held for a third time before the official lineup can be finalized.</p>

<h3>Business Conference Opening Anecdotes</h3>
<p>Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Authorities. In order to improve the transportation business. Sent letters inviting business representatives near the two railways. And invited expert committee members. Held a meeting in Shanghai to discuss. Choucheng, representing the New Pharmaceutical Industry Association. Was also among the attendees. So I recorded the anecdotes of the venue as follows.</p>
<p>The venue was the Jiande Savings Society on Fuxing Road, Old Baz Road. There were about one hundred and seventy attendees. The room was small and crowded. The arrangement was not easy. So the seats were arranged in a straight line of seven rows. They all sat face to face. Like the second-class car on a train. The tables were covered with white blankets. Each person had a glass of tea in front of them. The venue was served by car-based Xihui and waiters. So the etiquette was very considerate. A mahogany zither table was placed on the stage. Covered with a colorful brocade carpet. The colors were very bright. On the left and right were shorthand seats manned by Mr. Nie Desheng and Mr. Huang Xiaoxian respectively. Paper decorations and colorful electric lights were suspended above. In a cross shape. Fireplaces were installed in the four corners of the room. Exceptionally warm.</p>
<p>The Main Attraction Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Representative Wang Xiaolai. Gave a very long speech at the opening ceremony. Divided into reducing freight and transportation responsibilities. And the three essentials of low price, speed, and safety. And stated that the proposed motions. Hope the railway bureau does not regard it as a request for merchants to increase their own interests. But view it as a plan to assist the railway bureau in increasing its business. Quoted Article 641 of the Civil Code. Requested the Railway Bureau to revise Article 8 of Section 2 of the Transportation Regulations. Righteously and sternly. The listeners were moved. At the welcome banquet in the afternoon. When Mr. Wang delivered his welcome speech. There was also an extremely long speech. Quoted Zisi and Zeng Guofan's idioms. Described in detail the common problems of past meetings. Main purpose was that each motion passed this time. List each one in a list. Each Chamber of Commerce is responsible for supervising implementation. The language was very straightforward. The representatives present. Unanimously approved. Feng Yunshu said on the spot that Wang Xiaolai sang twice today.</p>
<h3>Government Officials Organize a Club</h3>
<p>Lü Bing</p>
<p>The capital's Lizi Society. Is a place for government officials to entertain after work. The rules of the society. Are quite strict. There are ten commandments written by Chairman Jiang. Smoking and drinking. Are all prohibited. Members must undergo a thorough review. So the procedures are also very difficult. Since Xuanwu Lake was changed to Wuzhou Park. The authorities sent people to clean it up. The arrangement is clean. The scenery is beautiful. Therefore, distinguished guests and ladies. Came to visit. After work, the government officials often set foot in it. Lingering in the scenery. The once barren lake. Suddenly became lively. Recently, He Yingqin, Sun Ke, Wang Zhengting, etc. To promote legitimate entertainment for government officials after work. Specifically initiated the establishment of a club on the banks of Xuanwu Lake. The address has now been found. The name is planned to be Heyuan. Because the lake water is rippling. Lotuses grow very well. And emerge from the mud without being stained. Also expresses noble intentions. In the club. High-class entertainment will be prepared. One part is the court. Chinese musical instruments will also be collected. In order to cultivate temperament. Other items such as Chinese chess and Go. Are also equipped. At the beginning of the launch. The initial membership fee is set at 200 yuan per person. Actively recruiting members.</p>
<p>A Major Attraction. Should be applauded. Everyone echoed. So there was thunderous applause.</p>
<p>They went to heights together. The opening ceremony was held on the fifteenth day. From 9:00 am to 11:30 am, the ceremony was completed. There was also a photography item on the order list. The master of ceremonies shouted, "Please take the representatives to the roof garden for a photo." The elevator can only accommodate a maximum of eight people each time. About two hundred guests and representatives. If everyone wants to take the elevator. Then it will take time to load and transport. So in addition to the elderly and frail. As well as those who are obese. They took the elevator separately. The rest all went up the ladder. The house is five stories high. There are about a hundred stone steps. Looking at it from a distance. It is very good-looking. When they arrived at the roof. Everyone was red-faced. Panting like cows.</p>
<h3>Violet Hosts Guests at Violet</h3>
<p>Tian Hen</p>
<p>Ms. Violet, a highly acclaimed singer and dancer. Has come to Shanghai again. At 7:00 p.m. the night before last. A big banquet was held for guests in the Violet Hall of the Jinling Restaurant. Shoujuan has always loved violets. Because of the flower and the person. I also greatly admire Violet's singing and dancing. The guests were received that night. Going back and forth to report. The description is very laborious. However, smiles were often revealed between the two assistants. Then he knew that he must be very happy in his heart. I am not aware of its labor. Hundreds of guests. Gathered together. Called a grand banquet. What is strange is. Among the guests, anyone who initially met Ms. Violet. No one did not wonder at her young age. It is not comparable to the Violet in his ideal. The same is true for me. When the lady came to Shanghai to perform two years ago. He won great fame and was widely spread. Today, measuring her age. It should be at least eighteen or nineteen. Who knows her age. It's only the number of moon circles. However, the number of moon circles. Still calculated in the lunar calendar. If calculated according to the abandoned calendar. It is only twenty-seven. When I came to Shanghai before. Only twelve years old. From this, it can be seen that her singing and dancing skills. In fact, it is endowed by nature. Therefore, it is unmatched by others. Before long, I went to my seat. First, Shoujuan gave an introduction. Then the lady gave a speech of thanks. All are very decent. The lady speaks Cantonese. Shoujuan was worried that the guests could not understand. Please ask Mr. Yao and Mr. Wei to translate. Only then can we fully convey its meaning. When the feast was halfway through. The lady got up again to test her singing voice. Mr. Someone plays the strings. Singing a section of Qingyi in "The Civet Cat for the Crown Prince". Both the voice and the tune have reached the highest level. Everyone was surprised again. I didn't expect her to be good at Erhuang. Finish. Re-sing Cantonese song "Xiao Xiang Qin Yuan". Combined and harmonized with three kinds of musical instruments. The singing voice is clear and melodious. Or depressed or raised. The gods of the qin and the grievances were transmitted in a cold manner. The inner heart of the concubine of Xiaoxiang. It seemed to come out of his mouth. It is truly a divine skill. Everyone applauded loudly. Seeing that the lady had finished singing and took her seat. I couldn't get enough of it. Still applauding. The lady stood up again with a smile. Sing a song of "Rain Hitting the Banana" to entertain the guests. Music is still the same. The singing voice is also still the same. The artistic conception is completely different. Listening to it. Pattering. Suddenly rapid and slowly. It is as if the rain is hitting the banana tree. It is chaotic and well-organized. At first, it's not just pleasing to the ear. The ancients said, "This song should only be found in heaven. How can it be heard a few times in the world?" I feel the same way about the lady's song. So I recorded it when I returned.</p>
<h3>A Record of Touring West Lake in the Snow</h3>
<p>Yu Jianhua</p>
<p>I have been away from West Lake for six or seven years. Six Bridges and Three Temples. Always haunted by dreams. Only bound by business. I can't visit again. This year, I am even more troubled by writing. An old friend, Ji Jun Xueyun. The head of the first primary school in West Lake. Repeatedly invited me to come over. So at noon on January 9th. He took a car in the heavy snow to leave. There were many mistakes in the car. Arriving in Hangzhou at two o'clock in the middle of the night. The cold wind was biting. The snow was flying in the face. West Lake is afraid of the cold. Deeply closed in the darkness. It is not visible. Only the electric lights around the lake are bright. Like a pearl chain. I stayed at the first primary school in Zhaoming Temple that night. The next day I went out with Ji Jun to travel. The whole mountain is snowy lake. The water is all ice. As far as the eye can see, it is like silver inlaid jade. Although the West Lake, which is always haunted by dreams, is thinner. But with light makeup and plain makeup. It is even more charming. Arrive at Ge Ling and look at Baochu Pagoda. To the west, there are large stones separated. Wearing stone cracks. The snow is deep and submerged. It is slippery and impossible to climb. So support each other and crawl forward like snakes. To Ziyun Cave. Two or three plum trees are already blooming. The cave is under a huge cliff. The strangeness is touching. The temperature is like spring. Go to Liandan Pavilion. Climb the Chuyang Terrace. Go down the mountain and visit the Huanglong Cave. Mostly artificial mountains. It is quite like the Lion Grove of Suzhou. The spring water is gurgling and flowing down. There is ice milk next to it. Four or five feet long. Like a pillar. Ji Jun broke one. Carry it on your shoulders. Those who see it laugh out loud. Go west and twist about ten miles. To Yuquan. Watch the five-color fish. Small fish are lively. Big fish are steady. They don't compete for food. There is the style of a gentleman. Out of the temple, I eat at Lingyin. Feilai Peak is in the Lingyin Mountain Gate. Huge rocks are stacked. Exquisitely suspended. Changed into a spectacle. Visit the Five Hundred Arhat Hall. To the north to Taoguang. Thousands of green bamboos on both sides. Swaying gracefully. My feet are tired. Jia Yong ascended Beigaofeng. Overlooking the entire lake. Like a round mirror. The Zhejiang River is winding. To the east into the sea. Looking west, thousands of mountains are undulating. All come out from underfoot. When I went down the mountain. The sun has already set. So I took a car back to the temple. On the morning of the eleventh, I walked to Chenghuang Mountain. The mountain occupies the city. Many temples. Many scholars. The market is lined up like a square grid around the mountain. The roofs are all white. Go down the mountain. Pass Siyan Well and spy on the Stone House Cave. There are many Buddhas in the cave. There are inscriptions by Po Weng. Explore the Water Music Cave. The cave is dozens of feet deep. It is so warm that it is unbearable. The sound of water is surging. There are stone bamboo shoots, stone lotus roots. Stone drums. Stone bell relics. Go up to Yixia Cave again. The cave is high and spacious with many stalactites. To Longjing. A pool of clear water. Famous in the world for tea. Go down the mountain into Jiuxi Eighteen Streams. The stream turns with the mountain. The mountain moves with the steps. The seclusion is steep and deep. Circling and twisting. As if endless. Out of the mountain to Jianggan. Watch the Six Harmony Pagoda. Looking at the pagoda from a distance is like a pigeon cage. Because my feet were tired, I didn't climb it. On the way back to Hupao Temple. Ji Gong Pagoda. The spring is clear and is the crown of West Lake. It was late when I returned to the temple. On the twelfth, I went to Gushan alone. Visited the tombs of Su Xiaoxiao, Wu Song and Qiu Jin. Visited the park, Fanghe Pavilion and Xiling Seal Society. The lake ice was very strong at that time. Many people walked on it. The boat was stuck and could not move. So I couldn't take a lake tour. After lunch, I visited Hangzhou. The city's commerce is very prosperous. The city government's rapid progress is the best in the country. I returned to Shanghai on the thirteenth. The wind stopped and the sun was warm. The cold was also slightly reduced. So I wrote it down while trembling with cold.</p>
<h3>Parisian Tales</h3>
<p>(7) Thoughts Once Sent in Paris</p>
<p>(2) Titanic Disaster Record</p>
<p>I remember reading about the sinking of the Titanic liner in the Chinese textbook of higher primary school more than ten years ago. I have been deeply moved. In the history of modern culture, the sinking of the Titanic is indeed one of the most touching disasters. The modern French poet Panul Claudel also wrote a very heavy poem about this story. Unfortunately, I cannot translate it here now.</p>
<p>Recently, the famous French director Du (E. A. Dupont) thought of recreating this tragic past on the screen, and we paid tribute to those unfortunate victims even more. He changed Titanic to Atlantis, but the important focus of his film. Not only in depicting the spectacular sinking of the entire human society in a vast ocean. But in dissecting the mental state of those who were victimized and the many strengths and weaknesses that human beings possess at the same time.</p>
<p>The first scene that appears in this film is a corner of the smoking room of a liner crossing the Atlantic Ocean. Several passengers are playing a card game called Bridge. Sitting around the table are a scholar named Zhan Fuli, who is paralyzed on one side, and his son and daughter-in-law who have just recovered from heart disease. There is also a big businessman named Lang Bai. Sitting next to the card table but not playing cards are the scholar's wife and a drunken comic. And a French singer who is being recruited by a theater in New York.</p>
<p>The first part of this film seems to be a little too long. From this part, we know that the liner is sailing in waters where icebergs pass by. We know that the businessman Lang Bai's wife is having an affair behind her husband's back. We also know that the singer is a timid man and that the comic is a fatalist. Finally, we also know that the captain is feeling uneasy.</p>
<h3>Warmth in My Heart</h3>
<p>(352) Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 17: Ren Peizhen said that there are ways to stay young and the eyebrows are confused, and there is no way to continue life, and the gold market is full of good horses.</p>
<p>While Ren Peizhen was talking. He picked up a glass of brandy in front of him. He took a sip. It was almost dry again. Lvyi had seen it clearly there. He poured a full glass for her again. Zuo Shichen knew that Ren Peizhen had been very frustrated recently. Although she had been messing around for a while, she had not mixed into a position. Those so-called female great men. Also made a lot of jokes. There are many people. They always use them as a source of jokes. Thinking that women also want to stand out. I really don't know how to measure myself. Therefore, they are getting into trouble everywhere. This time back to Shanghai. I don't know what's going on. The words she just said. It can be seen that all the complaints that were made. At this time. It's just that the national system is making a fuss. There is a group of people who support Yuan Kaiting to restore the imperial system. In Shanghai. There are many detectives. Lurking everywhere. Zuo Shichen was afraid that Ren Peizhen would drink a few glasses of brandy. Taking advantage of the temporary drunkenness. Say that kind of words that don't know the taboo. Gave Lvyi a wink. Asked her not to pour more wine. But Lvyi saw her drink quickly. So she poured it quickly. Just as I was feeling anxious. It just so happened that a savior came. Who do you think it is? It's this old Lin Daiyu. As soon as she entered the door. Said. Oh. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I'm too late. Which master is surnamed Ren? Sun Qilei pointed the way. It's that Mr. Ren. Old Lin Daiyu's eyes. Following Sun Qilei's finger, he flashed a glance. But first he was stunned. Because I thought this was a man. Or is it a woman? The robe she was wearing. It is indeed a man's. Her face. Also some masculine. Only a high bun was combed on her head. So it's definitely not a man. Just as I was hesitating. Zuo Shichen added another sentence. That one is Ms. Ren. Although she is a lady. She has always been sloppy and unruly. Just like our men. And that Mr. Ren. Still.</p>
<p>Is a female revolutionary hero. He used to lead a team of female revolutionary troops. Came from thousands of troops and horses. What kind of perceptive person is Old Lin Daiyu? As long as Zuo Shichen recites these few resumes. She completely understands. Knowing this androgynous person. Must be the so-called female revolutionary party. People who eat in the hall. All rely on a mouth to live. It will never be wrong to perfunctorily. But what does she want to call her? According to her age. You can also call her Mrs.. I just don't know if she is officially married. Maybe she is still a Miss. I called her Mrs.. Don't you want to be slapped? If you call her Miss. I feel that it is wrong again. Or she is already a wife. And those female revolutionaries. I don't want people to call her Miss very much. Thinking that the two words Miss are aristocratic names. Not to mention women. Men have also changed their names. I used to write the bureau account. All written as Master Someone, Old Master. Are they not changed to Mr. Someone, Mr. now?</p>

<h3>Financial News: Last Week's Gold Market Was Terrifying</h3>
<p>Momentarily Generating Startling Waves</p>
<p>The past week's gold market, filled with abnormal volatility, experienced frightening upheavals. The waves roared, the floods were unprecedented, people were terrified, and no one could be sure of anything. Fluctuations of ten or more taels were common, which was extremely rare. Compared to the week before, the beginning of the week trended downwards, but then the silver market rose madly, reaching for the clouds, truly initiating an unprecedented era. Afterwards, the situation suddenly turned unfavorable. By Friday (the 16th), coinciding with the swap date (March contract), the bulls still paid the bears, initially five or six taels, then four taels plus up to five taels. As for the February contract, it suddenly fell to 686 taels on Tuesday, but by Friday it surged to 747 taels. The March contract opened on the first day at 738.5 taels, then its momentum was unparalleled, reaching a remarkable peak of 755 taels by Saturday morning. Unexpectedly, by noon, it suddenly turned to a low point, breaking below 730 taels. The rapid storm was unpredictable, and industry professionals lost their bearings, making it difficult to act. Overseas silver markets this week saw the main bar silver rise to 18.75 in the near term and a long 0.625 in the far term. The US silver price was even. As for Shanghai exchange rates, the pound sterling slightly decreased by half a point (to 125). Japanese gold added 1.5 fen, setting a new record. However, it was vastly different from the overseas silver markets, especially in its divergent trends. The gold market, compared to the previous Saturday, actually fell slightly by 0.5 taels, which was the unified pull for February and March. If the swap of 5 taels is removed, then it fell by more than 5 taels. In this brutal upheaval, both the bulls and the bears faced extreme danger. What follows is a record of the general situation during these six days.</p>
<p>Frequently Setting Unprecedented Records</p>
<p>On Monday, the main bar silver rose again by as much as 0.6875, and US silver also rose by 0.875. Consequently, the pound sterling also increased by 1.5 points. The opening price of the February gold contract in the morning immediately fell by 11.5 taels, to 715.5 taels. Then, buying activity surged, rising by 8 or 9 taels, to 24 taels and 8 mace. Afterwards, it was extremely chaotic, retreating within 20 taels at noon. In the afternoon, rumors of a Sino-US loan caused panic, leading to a sudden drop to 705.5 taels. The closing price was 706 taels and 8 mace, continuing the decline of 20 taels and some mace from the previous Saturday. For the entire day, only the gold price opened high, mainly due to a telegraphic report from the United States indicating a tendency to sell silver, hence 714 taels, then 18.5 taels. Later, large corpses unloaded their holdings, eagerly going downstream, plummeting by more than 20 taels, only reaching 690 taels and 5 mace. In the afternoon, the long-term Indian exchange rate was high, falling further to 686 taels. With major players chasing after it, it quickly escaped the 700-tael mark. The exchange market tightened, reaching 704 taels and 2 mace. In the morning, the pound sterling suddenly loosened, settleable at 1.40625, and sellers increased, plunging 14 taels, to 690 taels. The closing price was 695 taels and 2 mace, a further decrease of 11 taels and 6 mace from the previous day. The difference between the morning and afternoon markets totaled 32.2 taels. On Wednesday, the main bar increased again by 0.125, the silver price added 0.25, and the pound sterling increased by one point. However, internally it tightened, and the gold market presented a reactive appearance, because Britain was again selling silver bars, and there were many buyers in the morning, leading to a high opening price of 703 taels. Then, with raging waves, there was a review of 10 taels. The pound sterling opened at 697 taels, and after entering, it penetrated beyond 700 taels again. In the afternoon, it suddenly rose by more than 10 taels, exceeding the 20-tael mark, due to large players buying in. However, it was Wednesday, and there was no foreign exchange market. The closing price was 718 taels and 6 mace, a rebound of 23 taels and 4 mace compared to the previous day. The up-and-down fluctuation in a single day was 23.5 taels. The next day, the main bar silver shrank back by as much as 0.08125, and the silver price fell by 0.01375, but the foothold was still good. The United States was again selling, so people were optimistic. The gold contract opened at 719 taels and 8 mace. Because it was the start of the swap date, there was no trading in the February contract, and the swap rate for the bears was 4.5 to 6 taels. It was recounted as 5 taels. It was heard that Hengxing and others had not yet completed their swaps and were pre-collecting cash. At noon, the closing price for the February contract was 43 taels and 8 mace, an increase of 10 taels and 8 mace from the previous day. The March contract opened at 38.5 taels. The Dalian guilds, Yifeng, Yong and others were competing to buy, soaring to 53 taels. The pound sterling was small at 0.125, but the gold market was extremely chaotic. The difference between the morning and afternoon markets was 14.5 taels, and the back market also had advances and retreats of 12.5 taels. In the afternoon, the market suddenly softened, as the exchange market eased and sellers increased. There was a violent drop of more than 10 taels, to 34 taels. The closing price was 35.5 taels. The up-and-down fluctuation for the entire day was 19 taels, and the complexity of the market was indescribable. By Saturday, the main bar silver shrank back by 0.03125, and the silver price shrank by 0.00625. The gold market soared by 10 taels, opening at 45.5 taels. With the United States leaning toward selling, people were extremely optimistic. Then, large players bought, continuing to rise by 10 taels, setting an unprecedented and astonishing new record, suddenly soaring, reaching a remarkable price of 755 taels. Afterwards, due to the exchange market turning sour and the price of Chinese raw silk greatly increasing abroad to prevent the main bar from rising again, especially because the large players, Hengxing, eagerly emerged, and the selling pressure from various firms was also fierce, the market suddenly presented a powerful reaction. It plunged like a waterfall by more than 30 taels. At noon, it reached 21.5 taels. After entering, there were still many buyers, rising to 30 taels. The noon closing price was 726.5 taels, a decrease of 9 taels compared to the previous day. The fluctuation in half a day was 33.5 taels. This kind of turbulence was truly rare, but the potential for drastic changes in the future is self-evident. What follows is a detailed description of the highest and lowest prices of English, American, and Indian silver markets, exchange rates, and gold contracts.</p>

The far term also rebounded by 0.1875, to 13 pence 0.3125. There was little buying in India, so the main bar silver rebounded, but transactions were scarce, and the market was stable.

English to American went down slightly by 0.03125, to 4 dollars 8 mace 5 fen 375. American to English fell by 0.09375, to 4 dollars 8 mace 5 fen 3125. Japanese to American was still 49.5 yuan.

<h3>Securities: Last Week, Bond Prices Increased Universally</h3>
<p>Transactions Totaled Over 37.6 Million</p>
<p>During the past week, the situation in the local securities market for various bonds was clearer than the previous week. The mood of buyers and sellers was increasingly dull each day. Apart from Monday, when transactions reached over 12 million, the busiest day, the remaining days were only between 5 and 6 million, totaling 37.67 million, a decrease of over 6.8 million compared to the previous week. The 19 customs bonds had the most, accounting for 9.425 million yuan, divided into 4.81 million for the January contract and 4.615 million for the February contract. The Disarmament Public Bonds were divided into 2.59 million yuan for the January contract and 4.36 million for the February contract. The 19 Reorganization Bonds were divided into 3.27 million yuan for the January contract and 2.76 million for the February contract. The Disbandment Treasury Bills were divided into 3.215 million yuan for the January contract and 2.47 million for the February contract. Other items were very clear, such as the Reorganization 6% bond, 690,000 yuan for the January contract and 1.665 million yuan for the February contract. The Customs Duty Treasury Bills were 1.425 million yuan for the January contract and 495,000 yuan for the February contract.

Other items were only several thousand yuan. As for the price changes of various bonds, the bond market environment was slightly better, and the prices of various bonds had fallen quite a bit in the previous week. Therefore, investors buying in were still active in the market. When opening at the beginning of the week, Reorganization 6 immediately jumped by about 2 yuan, and others also increased by about 5 or 6 jiao. However, the subsequent trend was unusually stable and moderate. Its sluggishness slightly declined until the weekend. The market situation had been idle for several days, and the environment had not changed slightly. Large players were still watching and not moving. The supply and demand situation felt particularly balanced. As a result, compared to the previous week, apart from the 96 bond slightly falling, others trended upwards. Among them, the 19 Cigarette and 19 Customs Duty Public Bonds each increased by 2 or 3 yuan for spot goods, which was relatively significant. Reorganization 6 futures also increased by 1 yuan and several jiao. However, others only increased by several jiao. What follows is a statistical list of the highest and lowest price increases and decreases of various bonds last week.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn: Last Week, the Yarn Market Was Extremely Stable</h3>
<p>Actual Demand Carried a Clear and Firm Tone</p>
<p>The yarn market last week was unusually stable. Due to a large number of transactions having been made, factories had less stock on hand, and their attitude was strong and assertive, with no intention of loosening their grip. In general, outsiders believed that the exchange rate changes had caused imported goods prices to rise. Currently, all goods are expensive, but yarn prices are relatively cheap, and there was a strong inclination to take advantage. The forward months were held tightly. As soon as the market fell, buyers flocked in. Manufacturers also entered the selling side in the forward months. Because of actual demand, the price had already risen by twelve or thirteen taels from when it was low. Many short sellers also entered. Chao bang and Japanese firms remained unmoved with their short positions. The overall situation was firm, with no cracks. However, the demand for spot yarn was more lacking. In the near months, two manufacturers closed out their long positions, with only a rise of 1 or 2 taels. The far months rose by 2 or 3 taels. Total transactions for the entire week were统计were 242,750 bales. Spot transactions by the Ke bang were bleak, but selling prices were still high. The total number of bales bought by various gangs for the entire week was 5,310 bales. Transactions among fellow merchants were 330 bales. Prices increased by 1 or 2 taels, depending on the lot. Japanese factories offered about 10,000 bales of 32-count and 42-count fine yarn. What follows is a record of the number of bales bought by various gangs.</p>
<p>Gang　　Bales　　Gang　　Bales　　Gang　　Bales</p>
<p>Fujian　130　　　Shantou 250　　Changsha 100</p>
<p>Ningbo　100　　　Tianjin 370　　Wuhu　　100</p>

<h3>The Cotton Market Last Week Amid Surging Gold Prices</h3>
<p>At the Weekend, Hengde Released More and Shifted to a Neutral Stance</p>
<p>The cotton market last week was completely dominated by the gold market. However, overseas cotton markets remained calm, with no changes. Yet, local sentiment in Shanghai was very strong, and optimism reached its peak. Because the source of Hankou cotton was not smooth, and Shanghai's inventory was weak, Japanese firms had some transactions involving the export of fire-damaged cotton in pressed bales, but the number of bales was small. However, the atmosphere in the market suddenly became tense, and the bulls' pull was dramatic. In general, sellers were frightened and panicked. As a result, the market's momentum was unbearable, rising immediately after a fall. New high prices were discovered every day. In fact, with the gold price in a raging storm, the cotton market fluctuated accordingly. This extreme situation was very difficult to grasp. Fortunately, at the weekend, Hengde released a large number of profitable long positions, the surface loosened, and the market stabilized. It was found that most of the Hankou gangs flipped to short positions. The future of the cotton market is still in turmoil. The highest price for contract cotton reached 5.8 taels, but after the bulls released their holdings, it fell slightly by 0.5 mace. As a result, each month rose by 0.5 or 0.6 mace compared to the previous week. Total transactions for the entire week were 696,300 dan. The source was 3,800 bales of Yao cotton and 2,700 dan of common cotton. Spot transactions at the local factories were still lacking. However, Japanese factories had some activity. It was found that the total number of dan bought by various factories was 10,640 dan. Trading firms took in 9,280 dan. The volume of American cotton was similar to the previous week. What follows is a record of the number of bales bought by various factories and trading firms.</p>
<p>Factory Purchases　Highest Price　Lowest Price　Number of Transactions　Term</p>

<h3>American Cotton: Plain and Unremarkable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market was bleak. Fellow merchants were watching. Futures prices fluctuated by 1 to 2 points. Spot prices remained unchanged. English cotton futures rose by 1 or 2 points. Spot prices remained unchanged. Egyptian and cotton goods rose by 10 points. The Indian cotton market was closed.

<h3>Grain and Food: The Rice Market Is Steadily Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday at Zhabei, only a few boats came down the river, about ten or so. Sales in this district turned sluggish, but sellers were still firm in their intentions, so the Beibang white japonica rice continued to advance steadily, nearly a jiao. The overall trend has been steadily firm. Thin paddy rice was scarce and sales were weak. The market looked good in terms of the numbers, nearing a chi. Lamb du rice transactions were not numerous, and buying was moderate. The peak price was barely 12.8 yuan. The Du Jian Bu Xian rice still withered in the end, and its route was not vibrant. However, its footing was quite stable, and the prices were uniformly elevated by one jiao. Sales in the Yuanshi market were still good, with the peak price at 13.55 yuan. This product was uniquely active in the market, and the production news was also good. In the near future, there was no hope of returning to a level price.</p>
<p>Yesterday at Hunan in Shanghai, the number of ships arriving from various gangs was not numerous, and the sales market started calmly and ended pleasantly. Sales of Changbang white japonica rice were mainly high, and the overall trend was extremely firm. The market for Suzhou Tong white japonica rice was only asked about by a small number of retail buyers. The prices of various japonica rices were steadily rising, nearing a jiao. Sales and arrivals of early thin paddy rice from the Nanbang were both stagnant, and the extra-high-quality goods rose slightly by between half a chi and one chi. There were not many transactions on both sides, and the trend seemed to be sluggish. Lamb du and jian rice continued to be firm and popular. However, both supply and arrivals were rare, and prices were seen to increase by a jiao. Circulation of common change was still robust, and the prices were not much different.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Japanese Sugar Continues to Fall</h3>
<p>Coarse Sand and White Sugar Are Still in a Standoff</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were no reports from the sugar market production areas due to Sunday. The activity of the public market association was especially weak, and actual sales were still sluggish. The trend was downwards. There were quite a few offers for 24-grade coarse sand white sugar from Dutch sugar, and the asking prices were very inconsistent, with some asking for between 10 yuan 0 mace 3.5 fen and 5 fen. But there were few inquiries, and only a small number had a slight intention to buy, and even lower prices were being offered, leading to a stalemate. The entire market had no transactions, and the market seemed to be at a standstill. Bowl green was priced at 8 taels 6 mace 5 fen, and Cuban ocean white at 8 taels 9 mace, but the number of transactions was also scarce. The trading of Japanese sugar was scattered, and the market was stepping down. The transaction price for N mark fell to 10 taels 0 mace 5.5 fen. 明治明治YP mark  two zeros seven cents and a half to seven cents, TM mark ten taels zero cents and a half, Minghua YT mark ten taels zero cents four cents. The market was sluggish. There were 54 packages of domestic ice white sugar offered on the exchange, priced at 12.5 yuan per tael. Because there was very little inventory in the market, the market was quite lively.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Last Week's Silk Market Was Brisk</h3>
<p>B-Grade Factory Silk Breaks 1,000 Taels, Factory Owners' Attitude is Firm</p>
<p>Yellow and White Silk Also Rises, Dried Cocoons in Short Supply, Demand Exceeds Supply</p>
<p>Last week, the local Shanghai foreign firms' silk market was increasingly brisk. Because textile factories in New York, Lyon, and other places have resumed work, the sales of raw silk have increased sharply, and factory profits have turned abundant. Overseas telegrams about silk frequently arrived in Shanghai, making the Shanghai silk market seem like a blockbuster after the New Year. The price of factory silk soared by more than 100 taels. Last week, European and American firms were still keen on Shanghai factory silk. Silk prices rose steadily, and the price of B-grade factory silk has risen to 1,030 taels. Manufacturers' inventories are insufficient, and the stock of raw material dried cocoons is scarce. The price of cocoons has soared by dozens of taels. Cocoon merchants are holding out for higher prices. Even at high prices, there is still a lack of large quantities of dried cocoons to buy. The government's relief bonds have a set term, and factory owners' attitude is firm. They will not sell if the price is too low. Therefore, transactions were difficult to complete during the week. Only more than 300 bales of silk were traded for the entire week, with prices trending upwards. More than 800 pieces of raw silk were exported. Overseas Chinese silk prices continued to rise. The prices of Chinese silk in New York and Lyon are listed below (New York price per pound, unit: gold dollar; Lyon price per kilogram, unit: franc):</p>
<p>Silk Type   New York   Lyon   Silk Type   New York   Lyon</p>
<p>High-Grade Shanghai Silk   3.40   328   Superior Dried Silk   2.35   189</p>
<p>Superior Shanghai Silk   2.98   280   Medium Dried Silk   1.85   14</p>
<p>Medium Shanghai Silk   2.59   138   Inferior Dried Silk   1.35   110</p>
<p>Inferior Shanghai Silk   1.10   190   Superior Big Silk   2.10   159</p>
<p>Superior Shandong Silk   2.50   227   Inferior Big Silk   1.25   105</p>
<p>Superior Sichuan Silk   2.55   230   Superior White Silk   1.10   100</p>
<p>Superior Gray Silk   1.65</p>
<h3>20,000 Sheets of Galvanized Iron from East Asia Are Scheduled for Shipment</h3>
<p>Recently, the spot market for East Asian galvanized iron has been extremely weak. Transactions from all sources are very active, so demand exceeds supply, and people's expectations are unusually high. Therefore, the standard price has risen to 1 tael and 1 mace (6 chi) and 1 tael and 3 mace (7 chi). It is said that there are still few spot goods. Therefore, companies in the same industry are buying from Japan. It has been found that a total of 20,000 to 30,000 sheets were ordered in the past two days, mostly 6 chi. The agreed-upon price is only 2 to 3 fen lower than the Shanghai market price. Therefore, it is feared that the standard price in the future will continue to rise.</p>

<h3>Meeting of the Executive Committee of the Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>Passed Measures to Protect Industry and Encourage Businesses</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce held its tenth regular meeting of the Executive Committee at 4 p.m. the day before yesterday. More than 20 executive and supervisory committee members, including Wang Xiaolai, Xu Jilong, Wang Yansong, Lu Fengzhu, Chen Songyuan, Wu Zhihao, and Lao Jingxiu, attended. Chairman Wang Xiaolai reported on various letters and documents, and then discussed the following cases: (1) Case on measures to protect industry and encourage businesses. It was resolved that the Ministry of Finance promulgated the regulations on salt for agricultural and industrial use, stipulating that industrial factories established by Chinese nationals could have their salt tax reduced or exempted, which is a measure to encourage businesses. Furthermore, the anti-dumping tax that is being planned stipulates that if foreigners import goods into China and sell them at a lower price than they do in their own country, an anti-dumping tax can be levied according to the deliberately reduced price, which is also a measure to protect industry. Furthermore, the match monopoly regulations implemented in the four northeastern provinces stipulate that when the matches produced within the territory are sufficient for sale, each household can refuse to sell and receive foreign matches, which is also a measure to protect industry. Therefore, these measures to protect industry and encourage businesses are gradually being implemented by the government. Now, two proposed measures are: (1) After the implementation of the factory tax, if foreigners also have similar factories in China, such as cotton yarn, silk weaving, cotton weaving, soap, printing, and cigarettes, a certain percentage of the factory tax collected from Chinese merchants should be refunded in the name of bonuses. Now that there is such a measure for the special wheat flour tax, it seems that it can be consulted and imitated. The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry should separately formulate bonus regulations according to the circumstances of each industry, so as to avoid the name of discounting taxes and avoid foreign excuses, while Chinese factories can actually be protected. (2) For domestic goods transported by state-owned railways, the freight should be reduced compared to similar foreign goods. Currently, the Railway Department has already approved price reductions for the freight charged by railways for domestic matches, and it seems that it can be extended to general goods. However, factories and shops that enjoy the benefit of reduced freight rates should be required to report to Chinese shipping companies for shipment if their goods need to be transported by water; otherwise, they will be deprived of the benefit of cheap railway transportation, so as to both protect industry and revitalize shipping. The above opinions should first be submitted to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry for adoption. As for other specific measures, all industries should be notified to express their opinions at any time, and the Chamber of Commerce will review and forward them (3) Case on the appointment of directors of branch offices of the Chamber of Commerce. It was resolved that Xia Xinzai be appointed as the director of the Pudong Branch Office, Yang Xueqiao as the director of the Qibao Branch Office, and Zhong Yibo as the director of the Jiangwan Branch Office. Then, they discussed the business tax rate and adjourned.</p>
<h3>The City Chamber of Commerce Requests a Reduction in the Tax Rate on Domestic Silk Fabrics</h3>
<p>It is inappropriate to levy up to 30 per mille.</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce believes that the draft business tax and other regulations of the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Finance levy 2 per mille on domestic woolen fabrics, while domestic silk fabrics, silk scarves, socks, etc., are regarded as luxury goods and classified as silk woven goods, with a tax of 30 per mille. This is not in line with the purpose of promoting domestic goods, and it is especially unbearable for commercial capabilities in this era of declining silk fabrics. Yesterday, in a telegram outlining opinions on the business tax rate, it was specifically requested that domestic silk fabrics be treated the same as domestic woolen fabrics, with a reduced tax rate to protect them.</p>
<h3>After the Prohibition of Likin, Investigation and Harassment Burden Merchants and People</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government yesterday received an order from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, stating: "In order to comply with the order, the Jiangsu Provincial Government instructed that the Ministry of Finance submitted that the abolition of likin and various tax levies similar to likin had been implemented on schedule in accordance with the order. On the same day of this month, the Ministry ordered the provincial financial departments, special financial commissioners, chief tax officers, supervisors of various maritime customs, and directors of various postal package tax bureaus to comply and report the end of the period. The Ministry has also submitted a document to the Ministry for record. However, at the beginning of implementation, abuses must be prevented in advance. Most tax thugs have not disappeared. Once they have nothing to rely on, they will collude with local patrollers and hooligans to rob and extort passing merchants and goods in the middle. General cargo customers and boat owners are inherently weak in self-defense and will inevitably suffer greatly, which will greatly hinder the future of abolishing bad government. It is proposed that the Court order the provinces to order the counties to be responsible for supervising the public security bureau and police force to strictly investigate and arrest them at any time. Once they are arrested and brought to justice, they will be severely punished in accordance with the law to deter others and prevent imitation, so as to demonstrate the government's sincerity in benefiting the people and eliminating evil. Therefore, it is requested that the provinces order the counties to strictly prohibit harassment after the abolition of likin for various reasons. Whether it is appropriate, I ask for your consideration and implementation." In addition to the separate order, the order is hereby issued to the Provincial Government to comply and order the subordinates to strictly investigate and prohibit everything to protect merchants and travelers. In addition to the separate order, the order is hereby issued to the Department to comply. In addition to the separate order, the order is hereby issued to the County Mayor to order the subordinates to comply. This order.</p>
<h3>Wusong Sand Fishing Boat Bureau Ordered to be Abolished</h3>
<p>Implementation of Likin Abolition and Tax Increase</p>
<p>All Bureau Members Dismissed</p>
<p>Cheng Kesun, Director of the Wusong Sand Fishing Boat Inspection and Tax Collection Bureau, and Wang Dezhao, Deputy Director, previously received an order from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance, stating that the abolition of likin and tax increase had been officially announced and implemented, and all ship double taxation should be stopped and abolished by a specific date. After receiving the order, the two directors Cheng and Wang immediately ordered each department to handle the completion and ordered the inspectors and verifiers to stop collecting donations. It has now been completed and abolished yesterday. All staff members were dismissed and reported to the Provincial Department for review.</p>
<h3>Yang Shuzhuang Left for Fujian Yesterday</h3>
<p>Zheng Baoqing and Others Traveled Together</p>
<p>Yang Shuzhuang, Chairman of the Fujian Provincial Government, has stayed in Shanghai for many days. Now that Mr. Yang has recovered from his illness, and the political affairs of Fujian Province are waiting to be dealt with, he ordered the Puan warship to sail to Wusong the day before yesterday. Yesterday afternoon at 3 p.m., Mr. Yang took a car to Wusong to board the ship and returned to Fuzhou. Those who returned to Fujian with Mr. Yang included Zheng Baoqing, Director of the Fujian Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, Cheng Shihui, Director of the Department of Education, Wu Shu, Director of the Maritime Public Security Bureau, Ma Deji, former Director of the Jiangnan Shipyard, Shi Jialin, Secretary of the Department of Finance, Lin Zhijin, Aide-de-Camp to Mr. Yang, and Secretaries He and Shen, as well as staff member Lin Yongzhao. Among those who saw them off were Chen Jiliang, Commander of the First Fleet, and Li Shijia, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Navy. Regarding the post-war affairs of Fujian Province, it is reported that Mr. Yang has already discussed and decided with Chairman Jiang.</p>
<h3>Headquarters of the First Fleet to Begin Operations Today</h3>
<p>After the Navy Reorganization Office was ordered to be abolished, the Navy ordered the headquarters of the First Fleet to be stationed in Shanghai to oversee the naval affairs in Shanghai. All the office buildings of the office have also been ordered to be taken over by the headquarters of the fleet. The staff members of the headquarters have now come to Shanghai from Fujian and moved into the office buildings. It is scheduled to begin operations today. Chen Jiliang, Commander of the Fleet, is also scheduled to visit the headquarters today.</p>
<h3>Navy Researcher to Travel to the East Today</h3>
<p>Investigating Shipbuilding Industry</p>
<p>The Ministry of the Navy believes that China's shipbuilding industry is still in its infancy, so it has specially dispatched Wang Zhiguang, Deputy Adjutant of the Second Fleet, Ye Zaifu, Director of the Shipbuilding Department of the Jiangnan Shipyard, and Lin Huiping and Sa Benxin, officers of the Ministry, to Japan to study and investigate. It is reported that Mr. Wang and others are scheduled to travel east by ship today. The investigation period is reported to be one year.</p>
<h3>A Good Opportunity to Expand Overseas Trade</h3>
<p>The National Goods Industry Federation Notifies All Factories</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Factory Federation notified all factories yesterday to expand overseas trade. The original letter stated: "Dear Sirs, Since the Nanyang Islands Inspection Group initiated by our Federation departed on November 8 last year, we have received repeated letters detailing the warm welcome from compatriots in various ports. Recently, we received a letter from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce stating that the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce wrote that this National Goods Inspection Group came to various ports in the South Seas to conduct inspections. Wherever they arrived, local compatriots gave them a warm welcome. The various samples they brought, although small in number, were greatly appreciated by the visitors, who said that they were comparable to imported goods. If they can be refined, they can truly occupy a place in the overseas market. Moreover, at this time of high gold and low silver, it is also a good opportunity for domestic goods to be promoted abroad. Li Juncheng, a director of the Chamber of Commerce, whose Tai Hing Company is well-capitalized, is willing to be promoted as a well-established merchant in Singapore. He usually pays great attention to domestic goods. A letter from the Xinyuan Firm in Shanghai a month ago described the beauty of the Double Knife Brand disinfectant water produced by the factory. After the Chamber of Commerce introduced it to Tai Hing Company, it immediately remitted thousands of dollars to purchase it directly. According to Mr. Li, all reliable factories or shops in China with excellent manufacturing prices, fair goods, and canned food, etc., need to be purchased and promoted on their behalf. I dare to ask your Association to inform the four domestic goods groups in Shanghai of this situation and ask them to convey it to the manufacturers. Those who want to expand trade overseas can directly contact the company and attach a sample price list for remittance, etc. The Chamber of Commerce has received it and is responding by transcribing the letter for delivery and listing the address of Tai Hing Company below (No. 1, Chulia Street, Singapore, English No. 1C Huba Street Singopul). I hope you will check and handle it, etc. Accordingly, a letter is sent, please check. If you want to expand trade, please contact the company directly. This is addressed to all factories, Shanghai National Goods Factory Federation."</p>
<h3>The Two-Way Business Conference Adjourned Yesterday</h3>
<p>The two-way business conference adjourned yesterday for the weekly holiday. The review reports from the previous day and other news are compiled as follows:</p>
<p>Review Report of the "Transportation Group":</p>
<h3>Case 1: Proposal to Convert the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways to Double Tracks and Increase Rolling Stock</h3>
<p>Review Result:</p>
<p>(1) Request the Railway Bureau to forward a request to the Ministry of Railways to first convert the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Suzhou sections to double tracks.</p>
<p>(2) The Railway Bureau is already preparing to add rolling stock, so there is no need for merchants to provide their own.</p>
<h3>Case 2: Request to Survey the Zhenjiang Baogai Mountain Tunnel and Other Bridge Projects to Ensure Safety</h3>
<p>Review Result: Request the Railway Bureau to conduct inspections and repairs at any time.</p>
<h3>Case 3: Purchase More Locomotives and Freight Cars, and Stipulate That Empty Cars from the Wheat Station Must Be Released to the North Station Early to Facilitate Loading and Unloading</h3>
<p>Review Result:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the addition of rolling stock, the Railway Bureau should report to the general assembly on the planned increase.</p>
<p>(2) The stipulation that empty cars from the wheat station should be released to the north station early is indeed the case, but there are also difficulties on the Railway Bureau's side. The Railway Bureau should be requested to instruct the Rolling Stock Department to handle the matter as appropriate. However, this problem arises from a lack of rolling stock. In the future, when the number of rolling stock increases, there will be no difficulty.</p>
<h3>Case 4: Request to Add Rolling Stock and Improve Dispatching</h3>
<p>Review Result: Report to the general assembly that the Railway Bureau has decided to rent 200 twenty-ton cars and has installed dedicated telephone lines for dispatching, which is expected to improve dispatching.</p>
<h3>Case 5: Request to Add Ten-Ton and Fifteen-Ton Load-Bearing Vehicles</h3>
<p>Review Result:</p>
<p>Because (1) the load-bearing capacity of the vehicles is too small, which is uneconomical for locomotive traction; (2) the vehicle body is too light, which is not very safe when passing curves; and (3) the Railway Bureau has already rented 200 twenty-ton cars, which is sufficient. With these three points, there is no need to add ten-ton and fifteen-ton freight cars.</p>
<h3>Case 6: Request to Prepare Special Vehicles for Transporting Silk</h3>
<p>Review Result: The two railways have paid special attention to the transport of silk. When the quantity is small, it is loaded into the guard's car. When the quantity is large, it is loaded into well-maintained covered cars and is not mixed with other goods, which is no different from preparing special vehicles. It seems there is no need to set up special vehicles separately.</p>
<h3>Case 7: Request to Equip Special Fresh Fish Vehicles to Avoid Losses</h3>
<p>Review Result: Request the Railway Bureau to issue covered cars for loading as much as possible within the possible range and add refrigerated cars when adding rolling stock in the future to meet demand.</p>
<h3>Case 8: The Traction Efficiency of Old Locomotives is Reduced; Please Try to Use New Locomotives as Soon as Possible and Repair Old Locomotives at the Same Time</h3>
<p>Review Result: The Railway Bureau has already started.</p>
<h3>Case 9: The Beijing-Shanghai Line Should be Converted to Double Tracks</h3>
<p>Review Result: Same as Case 1.</p>
<h3>Case 10: Request to Strictly Adhere to Train Schedules to Avoid Wasting Passengers' Time</h3>
<p>Review Result: Request the Railway Bureau to improve effectively.</p>
<h3>Case 11: Request to Strictly Adhere to Train Schedules</h3>
<p>Review Result: Same as Case 10.</p>
<h3>Case 12: Request to Increase Train Speed and Arrive on Time to Facilitate Passenger Travel</h3>
<p>Review Result: Same as Case 10.</p>
<h3>Case 13: Please Pay Attention to the Arrival Time of Trains to Avoid Market Price Losses for Fresh Goods</h3>
<p>Review Result: Submit the above-mentioned opinions to the general assembly. Under the current circumstances, although the 21st train carrying this type of goods sometimes deviates from the schedule, it still arrives earlier than other freight cars and should be unloaded quickly to avoid missing the market. It would be best to start two hours earlier on the Zhabei side, but it is not known whether this will interfere with loading in the South Zhabei district. The relevant chamber of commerce should formally write to the Railway Bureau after the meeting so that it can be handled appropriately when the timetable is changed next time.</p>
<h3>Case 14: Please Modify the Changshu-Shanghai Express Timetable</h3>
<p>Review Result: The Railway Bureau should be requested to review and handle.</p>
<h3>Case 15: Please Restore the Jiading-Shanghai Section Passenger Train</h3>
<p>Review Result: Request the Railway Bureau to restore the Jiading-Shanghai section passenger train after sufficient locomotives are available.</p>
<h3>Case 16: Please Extend the 41st Train to Yuyao to Increase Passenger and Freight Transport</h3>
<p>Review Result: If the 41st train is extended to Yuyao, the 45th and 46th trains will be delayed and cannot connect with the ships. It should be reviewed and handled again when sufficient locomotives are available.</p>
<h3>Case 17: Request to Allow Special Express Trains to Stop at Longtan Station</h3>
<p>Review Result: According to the Railway Bureau's report, the number of passengers at Henglin and Qishuyan is more than twice that of Longtan. The special express train has not yet stopped. If it is allowed to stop at Longtan, the above-mentioned stations will inevitably request the same, which may lose the characteristics of the special express train.</p>
<h3>Case 18: Request to Add Direct Freight Trains</h3>
<p>Review Result: According to the Railway Bureau's report, it is based on this principle, but there are inevitable delays due to handover and other reasons. The Railway Bureau should be requested to continue to do its best.</p>
<p>"Station Affairs Group":</p>
<h3>Case 131: Construction of the Wusong Ship Wharf and Warehouses to Facilitate Transportation</h3>
<p>Review Result: It was resolved that regarding the design of this proposal, the Association should suggest that the Railway Bureau convene a design committee for detailed discussion and design progress. The committee will be formed by the Railway Bureau sending letters to the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Huangpu River Conservancy Bureau, the Jianghai Customs, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, and the Wusong Chamber of Commerce to each elect one representative, and hiring four experts, and assigning six railway personnel to jointly organize it. Regarding economic issues, the entire Association will send a telegram to the National Government requesting the allocation of the Boxer Indemnity for construction.</p>
<h3>Case 131: Revise the Loading and Unloading Methods and Extend the Freight Yard Branch Line and Wharf to Facilitate Coal Transportation</h3>
<p>Review Result: Regarding the issue of loading and unloading workers, it is heard that the Legislative Yuan's Law on the Management of Workers is about to be promulgated. Once promulgated, reforms can be followed. Before it is promulgated, please have the Railway Bureau properly formulate measures to supervise workers to seek improvement. Regarding the issue of extending the surface yard branch line and wharf, it will be incorporated into Case 131 and planned and implemented by the Design Committee together.</p>
<h3>Case 134: Dredging the Jiaxing River Channel</h3>
<p>Review Result: It has been found that the current business situation of the station is not very good, with a monthly income of only about 1,500 yuan, while the dredging of the river channel is a huge project requiring a large amount of money, and there is no certainty about future business. For the convenience of merchants, it is recommended that the Railway Bureau instruct the Engineering Department to send personnel to measure and estimate, and then review and handle.</p>
<h3>Case 133: Building a Shipyard at the Benniu Railway Station</h3>
<p>Review Result: According to the current situation of the station, building a shipyard is not urgent, but the Railway Bureau should be requested to plan in detail within a reasonable period of time. Improve all facilities to facilitate transportation.</p>
<h3>Case 135: Reconstructing the Floating Wharf on the Ningbo River Bank</h3>
<p>Review Result: It has been found that the Engineering Department of the Railway Bureau already has a plan to repair and construct a wharf extending into the river and is already in progress. The Railway Bureau should be requested to instruct the department to expedite the process. As for the reconstruction of the floating wharf, not only does it require a large amount of money, but it is also feared that the silt will still lose its effectiveness when the tide rises, wasting a large amount of money without any practical benefit.</p>
<h3>Case 145: A Large Amount of Goods is Accumulated on the Nanjing River Bank; Please Allocate a Large Batch of Vehicles as Soon as Possible and Find a Way to Protect the Customers' Capital</h3>
<p>Review Result:</p>
<p>(1) It is recommended that the Railway Bureau instruct the Rolling Stock Department's Dispatching Section to allocate vehicles on a daily basis and add freight cars when necessary to clear accumulated goods.</p>
<p>(2) The coal port has always been dredged by the Railway Bureau's Engineering Department on time every year. As for widening it, it is difficult to do so because there is no room.</p>
<p>(3) There is a shortage of vehicles now, and stations are asking for them one after another, so empty cars are being sent to other stations. All stations are the same and have the same request to leave them at the station for loading. If the station handles it in this way, all stations will follow suit, which will have a significant impact on the entire line. It can be reviewed and handled in the future when the number of vehicles increases.</p>
<p>(4) The station's freight yard already has four buildings, which are currently occupied by the military, so there is a sense of lack. If they can be vacated, they can still be used. The Ministry of Railways' Yangtze River Ferry is actively underway. Once successful, this difficulty will not occur. There is no need to expand it now.</p>
<p>(5) The Association will send a telegram to the Ministry of Military Affairs to order the troops stationed there to move out quickly.</p>
<p>(6) High-sided factory cars were originally used to transport goods such as coal and gravel that were not affected by wind and rain. Recently, due to a shortage of vehicles, at the request of various companies, they were moved to load other goods, which was a temporary expedient measure. The Railway Bureau has already added rolling stock. Once it arrives, there will be no need for this method, so there is no need to add more tarpaulins.</p>
<p>(7) It should be handled in accordance with the Rolling Stock Department's notice of the previous year. If goods are stored because there are no vehicles to load them, they can be approved by the Rolling Stock Department for free after the stationmaster's certification, but only for one month.</p>
<p>(8) The Railway Bureau has now dispatched police to escort the cars. The Railway Bureau should instruct the Police Department to handle the matter carefully.</p>
<h3>Case 147: Delays in Freight Cars En Route Should be Rectified Urgently to Maintain Credit</h3>
<p>Review Result: It has been found that goods are delayed by a maximum of five or six hours from the Beijing station to North Shanghai. The Railway Bureau should be requested to find a way to avoid delays after this. As for intermodal freight, the Railway Bureau should be requested to thoroughly plan the connection of the freight train schedules of the two railways to achieve speed.</p>
<h3>Case 146: Ban Transfer Companies from Buying Cars to Avoid Idle Vehicles</h3>
<p>Review Result: It is recommended that the Railway Bureau notify various transfer associations to strictly prohibit the purchase of cars. If it occurs, it will be dealt with severely. As for the registered car allocation, because there is no priority standard, it is prone to malpractices. The Railway Bureau should be requested to re-plan a proper method to seek fairness.</p>
<h3>Case 181: Please Send Personnel to Strictly Investigate Smuggling and Dispatch More Separate Carrying Cars</h3>
<p>Review Result: Regarding the issue of strictly investigating smuggling, the Railway Bureau should send personnel to investigate secretly. Once found, it will be dealt with as usual. As for sending separate carrying cars, merchants can request the stationmaster to transfer and dispatch them at any time according to the amount of separate goods.</p>
<h3>Case 182: Pay Attention to the Cleanliness of Boxcars</h3>
<p>Review Result:</p>
<p>(1) The Railway Bureau should instruct the Rolling Stock Department to strictly order the stationmasters to supervise the porters to wash them carefully.</p>
<p>(2) The Railway Bureau should instruct the Rolling Stock Department to notify all parties concerned to pay attention to the outside and also send a letter to each transfer company to inform the loading partners to pay attention. Do not rush to load the cars and ask the station staff to load dry goods and iced fresh goods in the same car to avoid damage to the dry goods.</p>
<h3>Case 183: Cancel the Method of Pasting Photos on Beijing-Shanghai Railway Passenger Tickets</h3>
<p>Review Result: It has been found that the Rolling Stock Department has pasted multiple photos on the passenger ticket for joint use and to avoid malpractices. There is no need to change it again.</p>
<h3>Case 184: Set up a Solicitation Box to Solicit Opinions from Transport Merchants</h3>
<p>Review Result: It has been found that the Railway Bureau set up solicitation boxes at each station in the previous year. If merchants have any opinions, they can submit them according to the solicitation box rules.</p>
<p>"Freight Grade Group":</p>
<h3>Case 48: Please Reduce the Grade of Sundries and Native Cloth and Add Special Cars During the Peak Season for Tea Cocoons</h3>
<p>Review Result:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the reduction of the grade of sundries, there is no reason to reduce it again. (A) In 1930, the price per ton of less-than-carload was 2 yuan, 8 jiao, 1 fen, and 2 li. In 1931, it was reduced to 2 yuan, 4 jiao, and 08 li, which is 1 yuan, 4 jiao, and 02 li lower than before, a reduction of 63%. 2. (B) There are many types of sundries, which can be loaded separately. Merchants should not feel any loss if they load less native cloth. (2) Regarding the addition of special cars during the peak season for tea cocoons, special cars can be added as appropriate if sufficient locomotives are available.</p>
<h3>Case 49: Please Cancel the Newly Revised Grade of Egg Yolk and Egg White</h3>
<p>Review Result: It concerns all railways and is a modification of freight grades, which should be submitted by the Railway Bureau to the Ministry of Railways' freight rate meeting for discussion and resolution.</p>
<h3>Case 50: Please Revise the Grade of Short Steel Bars</h3>
<p>Review Result: Steel scraps are already waste materials. Steel of several feet is different and cannot be reduced again.</p>
<h3>Case 51: Please Calculate Paper Freight According to the Fourth and Fifth Grades</h3>
<p>Review Result: Merged into Case 67.</p>
<h3>Case 52: Please Allow the Freight of Shengzhou Pears and Fresh Bamboo Shoots to be Calculated According to the Fourth Grade</h3>
<p>Review Result: Shengzhou pears are of coarse quality and can be reclassified as coarse goods. The new regulations on fresh bamboo shoots have been cancelled, and special prices are calculated according to the fourth grade, which is not a problem.</p>
<h3>Case 53: Please Charge Bamboo Freight According to the Fourth Grade</h3>
<p>Review Result: The clause prohibiting bamboo transportation is not true. The freight for bamboo poles was originally listed in the fourth grade.</p>
<h3>Case 54: Please Reclassify Candy and Pine Flower Colored Egg Freight to the Fourth Grade</h3>
<p>Review Result: Calculated as less-than-carload, the freight rate in the new regulations is more than one time lower than before, so it cannot be reduced again.</p>
<h3>Case 55: Please Reclassify Tin Ingot Freight to the Fourth Grade</h3>
<p>Review Result: It must be submitted to the Ministry of Railways' freight rate meeting for review and handling.</p>
<h3>Case 56: Reclassify Green Bean Vermicelli and Wheat Noodle Freight to the Fourth Grade, and Reduce Artificial Silk to Express Package Freight</h3>
<p>Review Result:</p>
<p>(1) Reclassifying the freight of dry green bean vermicelli and wheat noodles to the fourth grade because the new regulations do not meet the requirements for a full carload of goods, and the freight is already lower than before, so it cannot be reclassified to the fourth grade. (2) Reducing the artificial silk to express package freight. (A) Artificial silk is not a domestic product and should not be reduced. (B) Since the transfer person is fully responsible, it can be packed and transported in burlap bags.</p>
<h3>Case 57: Please Revise the Scope of Application of Special Prices for Cotton Yarn</h3>
<p>Review Result: Fearing that it will hinder the merchants, special prices cannot be set at the moment and can only be handled according to the ordinary regulations.</p>
<h3>Case 58: Please Restore the Special Price of Yuyao Specialty Products</h3>
<p>Review Result: There is no special price for miscellaneous grains. The current freight rate for cotton is already lower than the previous special price by more than one jiao per car, so there is no room for further discussion.</p>
<h3>Case 59: Please Set the Freight Rate for Pine Wood from Zhabei to Changzhou</h3>
<p>Review Result: There was no special price for pine wood transportation. If 2400 cars can be packed and transported, the Railway Bureau can give a special price as appropriate.</p>
<h3>Case 60: Please Revise the Special Price of Rice, Wheat, and Miscellaneous Grains</h3>
<p>Review Result: The current freight rate for miscellaneous grains from Shanghai to Changzhou is 7 li, 5 hao, and 7 si per ton per kilometer, but the railway cost must be between 8 li and 1 fen, which is difficult to achieve.</p>
<h3>Case 61: Please Reduce the Freight for Bamboo Shoots and Other Goods</h3>
<p>Review Result: It seems difficult to reduce again. The reasons are: A. The old regulations for bamboo shoots were 6 yuan and 2 jiao per ton, and the new regulations are 5 yuan, 2 jiao, and 5 fen, which is a reduction of 9 jiao and 5 fen. B. There was a special price for bamboo brooms before, but it was cancelled due to the small amount of goods. C. The freight for aquatic vegetables was previously 1 jiao and 7 fen, but it has now been reduced to 1 jiao and 5 fen. D. The freight for tea was previously 2 jiao and 9 fen per 50 kilograms, but it has now been reduced to 2 jiao. E. There is a shortage of vehicles for rice freight, which is not enough for distribution. It can be reduced as appropriate when there are sufficient vehicles.</p>
<h3>Case 62: Please Reduce the Freight for Fresh Bamboo Shoots</h3>
<p>Review Result: It seems difficult to reduce because the price of bamboo shoots is quite high and should not be compared with vegetables. Also, the transportation costs of the two railways are different, and it is difficult to unify the freight rates.</p>
<h3>Case 63: Please Reduce the Freight for Changzhou Silkworm Cocoons</h3>
<p>Review Result: It must be submitted to the Ministry of Railways for reduction.</p>
<h3>Case 64: Please</h3>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>Reduce Cement Freight Result Review: It seems difficult to reduce again. The reasons are: A. The transportation cost for this year is about 8 li or more, and the freight rate for cement from Longtan to Shanghai is only 6 li and 1 si per ton. B. The special price for coal is mainly because it is transported from Shanghai and uses empty cars, so the price can be reduced as appropriate to facilitate transportation. It should not be used as an example.</p>
<h3>Case 65: Please Reduce the Freight for Silk Cocoons</h3>
<p>Review Result: It seems difficult to reduce again. The reasons are: A. Six dan of cocoons are needed to make one dan of silk. Six dan of cocoons are a total of 15 packages, and the freight from Xishan to Shanghai is 2 jiao and 8 fen per package, totaling more than 4 yuan, while the freight for each dan of silk is 9 jiao and 3 fen. The difference between the two is huge. B. Even if it is transported by passenger car, the price per dan is only 2 yuan, 2 jiao, and 5 fen.</p>
<h3>Case 66: Please Reduce the Freight for Cocoon Silk and Rotten Cocoons</h3>
<p>Review Result: It seems difficult to reduce again because the third-grade freight is already cheap, and the less-than-carload freight in the new regulations has been reduced. The freight for less-than-carload in the new regulations is even lower.</p>
<h3>Case 67, 51: Please Reduce the Freight for Paper Products</h3>
<p>Review Result: The freight rate set in the new regulations is lower than before. For example, from Gongchen Bridge to the South Station, each 25-ton car has been reduced by 7 yuan, 8 jiao, and 3 fen.</p>
<h3>Case 68: Please Reduce the Freight for Silver Dollars to Regulate Finance</h3>
<p>Review Result: It must be submitted to the Ministry of Railways for review and handling.</p>
<p>Supporting the Proposal: The Shanghai National Products Factory Federation sent a telegram to the representatives attending the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Business Conference yesterday, saying: I have just learned that the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Ningbo-Shaoxing Section Association has proposed to reduce the freight rate for national products to develop domestic industries, which is extremely enthusiastic and admirable. Our association strongly supports this proposal. Please, gentlemen, uphold the legacy of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's industrial salvation when discussing it and pass it unanimously to maintain national products and benefit people's livelihood. The telegram is filled with anticipation.</p>
<h3>National Products Exhibition Representatives Went to Jiaxing Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Petition Representatives from the Central Convertible Bond Holders' Association Went to Beijing</h3>
<p>According to the Huadong News Agency, the Central Bank's Provisional Convertible Bond Holders' Association, in order to request redemption, publicly elected representatives Wu Deyu, Pan Jiazhen, Dong Xihou, Dai Dacheng, Qiu Juping, Zhou Banruo, and other six people to go to Beijing to petition the National Government's Executive Yuan, Ministry of Finance, and other relevant ministries and departments. The representatives took the Beijing-Shanghai night express train to Beijing on the evening of the 16th. The following is an excerpt from their petition:</p>
<p>The central bank's provisional convertible bonds cannot be redeemed indefinitely, causing public panic and hardship for merchants, making it impossible to make a living. We respectfully request that you consider the people's difficulties and graciously allow immediate redemption to alleviate the merchants' difficulties and benefit the people's livelihood.</p>
<p>The Central Bank's Provisional Convertible Bonds were issued by the Commander-in-Chief of the National Revolutionary Army with the approval of the National Government in 1926, circulating in the market and used in full. Later, when the Nanjing-Wuhan split and the political situation changed, the convertible bonds could not be redeemed and became like waste paper. The merchants and people holding the bonds suffered an unexpected blow, like a bolt from the blue, and were extremely panicked. For the past four or five years, they have been penniless and struggling to make ends meet, living in misery.</p>
<p>Your Excellency has been diligently serving the Party and the country, managing numerous affairs, giving priority to the people, and laying a solid foundation for the country. How dare the merchants and people burden your Excellency with trivial personal matters? For several years, we have endured hardship and suffering and have not dared to speak out, but that is it. Now that the military affairs are over and the country is unified, Your Excellency is working diligently and starting anew with the people, and your prestige is resounding at home and abroad, bringing joy to all the people. We look up to your virtuous prestige and offer our sincere prayers. At this time of peace and joy for all the people, the suffering that the merchants and people have endured for several years should be quickly relieved.</p>
<p>Your Excellency loves the people like children, regards the people as injured, and treats all people with compassion. We humbly request that you provide relief and extend your grace to the needy. All the merchants' and people's difficult situations and reasons for requesting redemption were previously submitted to Your Excellency twice last year. Since February, the people have been eagerly awaiting a response, but have not received any instructions, which is extremely urgent.</p>
<p>Therefore, Wu Deyu, Pan Jiazhen, Dong Xihou, Dai Dacheng, Zhou Banruo, Qiu Juping, and other six people were publicly elected to visit Your Excellency, respectfully submit a petition, and humbly request an audience to accept the request. We pray for rain and dew to relieve the hope and avoid the worry of withered lives. Blessings will spread everywhere, and the poor and needy will be infinitely grateful. Other details will be presented in person by the representatives.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the total amount of these convertible bonds issued was 5 million yuan. The Jiangxi Provincial Government has recovered 3 million yuan, and the remaining amount circulating among the people is actually only 2 million yuan. However, due to the communist banditry in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces over the years, most of these convertible bonds have been lost, and many holders have encountered water, fire, thieves, or mislaid them. The actual number of registered holders is only 566,730 yuan, which is only slightly more than one-tenth of the total amount issued. We hereby state this for your consideration. We respectfully submit.</p>
<h3>Continuing to Request Negotiations on the United States' Restriction on Egg Yolk Acidity</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Sends a Telegram to Minister Wu</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce telegraphed Minister Wu Chaoshu on the 16th, saying: To Minister Wu Chaoshu of the Chinese Embassy in Washington: On the 16th of this month, we received a letter from the Egg Factory Association, stating that the US Department of Agriculture is using the excuse of restricting egg yolk acidity in an attempt to control the import of Chinese egg products. We previously sent a letter requesting your association to telegram the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to forward a telegram to the US Ambassador to protest seriously to the US Department of Agriculture. Later, because all the eggs shipped from Shanghai were detained, the situation was urgent, and we sent another letter requesting your association to telegram Minister Wu directly to request negotiations.</p>
<p>For several months, we have heard that Minister Wu has protested several times and strongly argued, for which the merchants are grateful. However, the US government is deliberately destroying our country's industries, and the detained eggs have not been released until now. Moreover, at this time, the trend of high gold prices and low silver prices is surging. If the eggs are returned, Chinese merchants will inevitably have to return them in gold. This loss is enough to bankrupt Chinese merchants.</p>
<p>Therefore, we plan to request your association to telegram Minister Wu again to continue to work hard and seriously negotiate, hoping to achieve the goal of releasing all the detained eggs and canceling the new restrictions so that Chinese merchants will not suffer greater losses and the industries that have been painstakingly managed for decades can also extend their lives and recover some rights for the future of international trade. We are very anxious and look forward to it.</p>
<p>We received the letter from the association, which stated that the matter had been telegraphed to the US Minister by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and our association, requesting negotiations with the US government for release. Now, according to the association's report, these egg yolks are still being blocked from import. If they are all returned, Chinese factories will have to settle the received payments in gold and return them to foreign merchants. At this time of rising gold prices, they are actually in danger of bankruptcy. In view of the previous situation, we hereby report the matter again. We sincerely hope that you will consider the difficulties of the egg factories and make every effort to negotiate so as to cancel the new regulations restricting acidity and maintain a lifeline for the egg factories, which would be convenient for the public.</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce bows and inquires.</p>
<h3>City Propaganda Department Strictly Enforces Newspaper Registration</h3>
<p>All Newspapers and News Agencies</p>
<p>Must Register According to Law</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Party Department Propaganda Department, upon receiving instructions from the Central Propaganda Department, processed newspaper registrations. Previously, it had notified all newspapers and news agencies in the city to register with the department. However, a few newspapers and news agencies have not yet complied. Therefore, another deadline is set: from the 12th of this month to the 12th of February. During this one-month period, all those who have not registered must send personnel to the department to complete the registration procedures. Furthermore, the department inquired with the Central Propaganda Department whether small newspapers such as those published every three or five days fall within the scope of newspaper registration. Now, it has been instructed that small newspapers should also handle registrations according to the newspaper registration method. Therefore, all large and small newspapers and news agencies in the city should promptly proceed with registration. If they still fail to complete the registration procedures after the deadline, the City Propaganda Department will, in accordance with the regulations, petition the Central Propaganda Department to prohibit their publication.</p>
<h3>City Executive Committee Revises Holiday Rest Regulations</h3>
<p>Sunday Full Day Rest</p>
<p>Monday Normal Work</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Party Department Executive Committee previously stipulated that every Sunday would be handled as usual, and Monday afternoon would be a rest day. Now, after the 80th Executive Committee Standing Committee meeting the day before yesterday, it was resolved to revise it to a full day of rest every Sunday and normal work on Monday, starting from next week.</p>
<h3>Lawyers Association Joint Meeting of Executive and Supervisory Committees</h3>
<p>Seventieth Meeting</p>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association convened its 70th Joint Meeting of Executive and Supervisory Committee members yesterday (Sunday) at 10:00 AM. Committee members present included Liu Zuwang, Tang Yingsong, Qian Zhongluo, Wu Shougong, Yan Yinwu, Zhang Enhao, Lu Dingkui, Zhao Zuzu, Jiang Yiping, Tan Yigong, etc. Liu Zuwang served as chairman, and Dai Ji served as recorder. After the preliminary formalities, the following matters were discussed: (1) Regarding the letters from the two courts of the Shanghai Special District responding to the request to issue refusal certificates, unless there are special circumstances, the parties can wait for processing in the court immediately without waiting for this, in order to expedite the case. The resolution was to forward it to all members for reference. (2) The Shanghai Accountants Association responded with a letter recommending accountant Wang Haifan to voluntarily audit the association's revenue and expenditure accounts for the second half of the nineteenth year. The resolution was to file it. (3) Member Zhang Ding replied, stating that he had not sent anyone to establish an office in Jiangdu to handle litigation. The resolution was to forward it to the Jiangdu Lawyers Association for reference. (4) Applications for membership from lawyers He Shizhen and Ji Hongzhang were approved. (5) Member Ye Fukan reported that Judge Shen Shumu of the Special District Court slapped the table, shouted, and insulted him. He requested assistance. The resolution was to excerpt the original report and send it to the Special District Court for verification and handling. (6) Member Fei Guoxi reported that lawyers Shi Ying and Yuan Yang'an had filed illegal lawsuits and requested a warning. The resolution was to first forward the original text to members Shi and Yuan and request a factual response before the general meeting for discussion. (7) Committee member Dong Kang sent a letter requesting an interpretation of the legal ambiguities of leasing relationships. The resolution was to appoint committee member Tang Yingsong to review it. (8) Member Wu Quan proposed that civil mediation documents should not be accepted by the court unless they are drafted and sealed by a lawyer, to prevent abuses. (9) Member Tang Yingsong proposed that the higher court be requested to interpret whether the special power of attorney for a lawyer appointed as a civil mediator is to appear in court as a lawyer. (10) Member Jiang Yiping proposed that since the implementation of the Civil Mediation Law, the section on agents allows ordinary people to act as agents, resulting in lawyers' status being almost the same as any ordinary agent, which damages the reputation of lawyers. The resolution was to combine the above three cases and appoint Yu Zhongluo and Tang Yingsong to contact the Shanghai Local Court first, and then devise a solution. (11) It was decided that the standing committee meeting would be convened at 8:00 PM on January 23. The resolution was to approve it and convene it on time. After the discussion, the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>People's Whereabouts</h3>
<p>Nanjing Mayor Wei Daoming and Aviation Vice Minister Zhang Huichang both took the night express to Beijing last night. Also on the train were Polish Minister Weidengtao and several others.</p>
<h3>Unresolved Case of Indian Soldier Shooting Wang Jingtao</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council's Reply Only Offers a Donation of One Hundred Dollars</p>
<p>The Deceased's Wife, Wang Mao, Writes to the Chinese Directors for Assistance</p>
<p>At 7:30 PM on March 31st of the 16th year of the Republic of China, Wang Jingtao, a local resident who worked with leather shoes, was passing through Gaolang Bridge and was about to reach his home in Wangjiazhai. Because that place was the boundary between the Chinese and Concession areas, the Municipal Council had erected a wire fence and stationed a team of Indian soldiers nearby. Wang, who had not returned home for many days, saw the wire fence blocking the entrance and was hesitating when he was unexpectedly shot twice by an Indian soldier. The bullets hit Wang's vital points, and he died after ineffective treatment. Although Li Jinfu of the former Provisional Court came to examine the body and instructed the deceased's wife, Mao, to report to the Diplomatic Mission for negotiation, Mao, being a woman and lacking relatives to help, has delayed it until now. The living harbor grievances, and the dead bear injustice. Now, Mao, seeing her children gradually growing up and needing a lot of expenses for education, etc., specifically reported the situation to Fexter, the general manager of the Municipal Council, and Edwards, the chief of the Municipal Council, requesting compensation of 20,000 yuan for the loss of her husband's life. The reply from the Municipal Council received the day before yesterday stated, "In response to the letter addressed to the general manager and secretary, we have learned that you are requesting compensation of 20,000 yuan for the loss of your husband's life who was shot by the protection group in the Concession in 1927. We hereby reply that this matter is not related to this bureau, so we cannot compensate for all the losses of your husband's death. However, this bureau thinks that the protection group was specially established to protect the lives and properties of Chinese and Western residents in the Concession. Your husband unfortunately lost his life because of this, which is very regrettable. The protection group had previously notified that no one should violate its orders during martial law. Although your husband did not intentionally violate it, his actions were very similar to those who disturbed the public security of the Concession. The protection group was performing its duties, which led to this unfortunate tragedy. Now, this bureau has specifically added this matter to the agenda. After discussion, in order to pity your situation, we will exceptionally donate 100 yuan to subsidize the past funeral expenses. You can come to the General Patrol Office to collect this amount. This is the reply." After receiving the letter, Mao felt that the various statements made by the Municipal Council disregarded the lives of Chinese people. Yesterday, she sent separate letters to the five Chinese directors of the Municipal Council, Yu, Yuan, Xu, Liu, and Hu, and the six Chinese committee members, Qian, Lin, Wu, Qin, Chen, and Li, requesting them to uphold justice and provide assistance.</p>
<h3>Gospel for Rickshaw Pullers</h3>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau Approves Rent Reduction</p>
<p>Rickshaw pullers Meng Jinchen and others reported that the concession rickshaw merchants had repeatedly increased the rickshaw rent to 1.13 yuan per day. Ordinary rickshaw pullers who worked hard day and night not only found it difficult to make a living, but also found that the income from their hard work was not enough to pay the rickshaw rent. Especially during the cold winter with ice and snow, they felt the pain of insufficient income. Therefore, they repeatedly submitted petitions to the City Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau and other agencies, requesting them to order the rickshaw merchants to reduce the rickshaw rent in order to maintain the livelihood of ordinary coolies. Yesterday, Rickshaw puller representative Meng Jinchen received Directive No. 4064 from the City Social Affairs Bureau, which stated, "We have received a case presented by Meng Jin and others, rickshaw pullers from Zhabei, requesting that the eight associations of Chinese and foreign rickshaw merchants be stopped from raising rents. We have learned that regarding your request to stop rickshaw merchants from raising rents, we have already met with the City Party Department and instructed them to reduce it appropriately. You should be informed of this." Signed, Director Pan Gongzhan.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Civil Affairs Department Sends Personnel to Investigate Police Affairs</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Civil Affairs Department now wants to understand the actual situation of police affairs in various counties in order to rectify them. It has sent special personnel to investigate the seven counties belonging to Songjiang. Investigator Gao Tianxu, after completing his work in Qingpu the day before yesterday, came to Shanghai and went to the Shanghai County Public Security Bureau. Director Yan also appointed the head of the second section, Chen Guozhen, to accompany the investigation and record the details separately. Yesterday, the commissioner went to Chuansha for investigation.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Factory Silk Prices Rise</h3>
<p>Already Over One Thousand Taels</p>
<p>In the Shanghai foreign firm silk market, the sluggishness of European sales in November and December of last winter can be said to have reached its peak. At the end of the year, the gold market soared, and financial activities in European and American markets and sales of silk fabrics were smooth. Various silk weaving factories started their machines to work, weaving spring silk fabrics. The consumption of raw silk increased sharply, especially Shanghai factory silk. After the New Year's opening, the R-grade factory silk rose by 150-160 taels. Due to the scarcity of dry cocoon raw materials and the soaring price of cocoons, manufacturers insisted on selling at high prices. European and American firms had a strong intention to import, and silk prices gradually increased. Currently, the price of R-grade factory silk with 15-15.5 strands has risen to 1,020-1,030 taels, an increase of about 200 taels per dan compared to the first half of December last year. The prosperity of the silk market can be seen from this. However, the capital of various manufacturers has been completely depleted, and they all hope that the government will approve the immediate issuance of factory silk industry public bonds to provide relief.</p>
<h3>Recent Events in the Fingerprint Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau</h3>
<p>High Court Entrusts Fingerprint Identification</p>
<p>Zeng Shude, the director of the fingerprint section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and clerk Song Yuntao have achieved remarkable results since handling fingerprints. The fingerprints of criminals submitted by various district offices under the bureau every day have been identified by Zeng and Song, and important cases of repeat offenders have been frequently detected. Recently, in a case of 2,000 yuan debt between Yin Xianfu and Wang Caiyun, an appeal was filed with the High Court. Yin then submitted Wang Caiyun's fingerprint as evidence. The High Court instructed the Shanghai Local Court to entrust the fingerprint section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau to conduct the identification and paid an identification fee of 15 yuan. Director Yuan immediately dispatched clerk Song Yuntao and clerk Cai Guozhen to the Local Court to identify the eleven fingerprints that Wang had made. The fingerprints were identified as loop-shaped, from the outer end to the inner end, passing through the top of sixteen fingerprints. The third, fifth, and seventh lines were semi-circular, and the thumbprint was also loop-shaped. The identification confirmed that it was consistent with the fingerprint under Wang Caiyun's name on the receipt. In order to be cautious, clerk Song brought the fingerprint back to the bureau, and after further review by director Zeng of the section, he issued a fully responsible identification certificate, which has been reported to the High Court for verification.</p>
<h3>Central National Medical Center Continues to Appoint Qin Bowei and Others as Promoters</h3>
<p>The Nanjing Central National Medical Center, originally scheduled to be established on January 15, has now been changed to March 15 due to the time required for preparation. For the sake of prudence, famous doctors such as Qin Bowei in Shanghai have been re-appointed as promoters. Mr. Qin has rich writings and a long-standing reputation. He currently serves as the standing committee member of the National Pharmaceutical Association, the review director of the Shanghai National Medical Association, and the editor-in-chief of the Chinese Medicine Bookstore. Mr. Qin is currently drafting an article on the reorganization and construction of Chinese medicine for the reference of the museum, which will surely make a considerable contribution.</p>
<h3>Nine National Arts Groups Welcome Chu Minyi's Grand Occasion</h3>
<p>At 7:00 PM last night, the Zhejiang Province, Jiangsu Province, Shanghai City, three national arts museums, Jingwu Athletic Association, China Athletic Association, Zhijou Boxing Club, Shanghai Martial Arts Association, and Shanghai Martial Arts Research Society, nine groups, set up a banquet at the Central Western Restaurant on Fourth Avenue to welcome Mr. Chu Minyi. More than 20 people, including national arts experts Ye Liang, Tong Zhongyi, Chen Weiming, Wu Jianquan, Liu Bochuan, and guest Weng Deqin, attended. The chairman of the Zhejiang National Arts Museum, Su Jingyou, first delivered a welcome speech and requested Mr. Chu to propose to the central government: (1) National arts should be included in the National Games; (2) There is a current lack of national arts teachers, and the government should find ways to set up more normal classes; (3) Compile national arts series to promote and advocate. Afterwards, Mr. Chu stood up and replied, stating that this time he went to the competition with industrial, commercial, educational and other items, and the sports books and other items he brought were originally part of education, but unexpectedly attracted special attention from foreigners. It is a pity that the photos and pictures attached to the books are not true and beautiful, and they are in Chinese, so foreigners cannot understand in detail. This is probably due to the hurried preparation time. In the future, if there is an opportunity, not only Chinese books should be compiled, but also national art books in various languages should be compiled, and attention should be paid to beautiful pictures to arouse interest in national arts. The Japanese often use our national essence, use words and send people to the West to promote it, so that foreigners think that only Japan has it. During this trip to various countries, I feel that relying solely on oral lectures is not very economical and not practical. There are overseas Chinese and foreigners who have entrusted domestic guards to teach, so I feel that compiling books and training teachers are very necessary. As for the inclusion of national arts in the National Games, I think that the various sports events in the future should be divided into two types: championship competition and health competition. Ironware, throwing and other categories in the sports meeting are only local sports. However, because it is common in various countries, it is only necessary to have a small number of talents to cover the international championship competition. Championship competition is a direct minority, and health competition is an indirect group. Foreigners always see us as poor and weak, so we should promote group health. Only healthy people can rejuvenate and achieve a strong nation. Who dares to insult us, etc." Subsequently, Weng Guoxun of the Martial Arts Association and Chen Jiaxuan of the Shanghai National Arts Museum successively made proposals. The meeting ended at 9:30 PM, and it was decided to convene an expanded meeting of sports groups at Chu's residence next Sunday to discuss the various proposals in order to make suggestions to the central government.</p>
<h3>National Medical Center Adds Promoters</h3>
<p>Famous Doctor Fang Gongpu Accepts the Invitation</p>
<p>The preparatory committee of the Nanjing Central National Medical Center recently proposed to add famous doctors in the medical field as promoters, believing that at the beginning of the preparation, it can only receive the effect of easy lifting of public support. It is heard that Fang Gongpu, a doctor in this city, has been hired. Fang has long been famous in Shanghai, and has served as military medical officer of the Wusong Fortress Command, member of the Chinese Medicine Test Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau, executive member of the Shanghai Chinese Medicine Association, supervisory member of the National Pharmaceutical Federation, professor of the Chinese Medical College, etc. With high qualifications and rich knowledge, this appointment will surely bring a new contribution to the future of the National Medical Center.</p>
<h3>Grand Opening Meeting of Dada Bank</h3>
<p>The Dalian Bank in this city, organized by Tang Shumin and Tang Haishan and Huang Mingdao, has been prepared. Yesterday, the shareholders' founding meeting was held on the second floor of the new house on Beijing Road. Directors and supervisors were elected on the spot, including Ding Jiahhou, Wu Jihong, Wang Zhiyuan, Gu Chongqing, Liu Huizhi, Wang Zixun, Wei Tingrong, Hu Ziyu, and Huang Jiyan. It is reported that it has been submitted to the ministry for registration and will soon be inaugurated on an auspicious day. This bank was initiated by well-known figures in the financial world and supported by the industrial sector. The future development of the business can be predicted.</p>

<h3>Xiao's Mother's Sad Voice</h3>
<p>Telegrams Urging the Anti-Dutch Association to Work Hard</p>
<p>The Republic of China's Foreign Affairs Support Association for the Netherlands has been difficult to actively proceed due to various external influences. Xiao Huangling, the mother of Xiao Xin'an, again telegraphed the association yesterday, urging it to continue its efforts in order to achieve its goals. The original text is recorded as follows: To the Republic of China's Foreign Affairs Support Association for the Netherlands, I, Xiao Huangling, report that my daughter, Xiao Xin'an, was employed by the Peide School on Annur Island, South Seas, and was assigned by the Nanjing Municipal Education Bureau. In September of last year, she set sail, but unexpectedly was insulted for no reason by the second mate of the Zha Hua wheel. Thinking that my daughter traveled far alone, relying on the South Seas, with no help from relatives and few consolations from old friends, she sobbed in the middle of the night, unable to express her hatred. Thank you all for your enthusiastic rescue and reasoned struggle. With a high call, the world responded. I am grateful, not only my daughter Xiao Xin'an, but also the Xiao clan, also pray without end. I beg your association to uphold justice and never change. Only with a hundred bows do I earnestly beg to continue your efforts in order to achieve your goals. Then the glory of your association can compete with the sun and the moon, and the Xiao clan will also be grateful. respectfully, Xiao Huang of Yixing County.</p>
<h3>Philippine Smuggling of White Slave Organizations</h3>
<p>Reported by Smuggled Chinese Women</p>
<p>Philippine Officials Are Conducting Strict Investigations</p>
<p>The mainland newspaper reported that Philippine customs immigration officials are currently working with police detectives to strictly investigate the smuggling of white slave organizations between the island and various ports in China. This matter was triggered by a rather beautiful Chinese girl who was smuggled to Manila and took the opportunity to report to the customs office, which led to the discovery. The girl is from Xiamen, but it is said that there are such smuggling organizations in various ports in China, and some famous overseas Chinese in Manila are also connected with them. The girl was lured out of her aunt's place by two Chinese and smuggled to Manila. The agency stationed in the Philippines routinely guaranteed her to customs, lived in a place, and waited for the final interrogation by immigration officials. The girl met a woman in the place where she lived and, with her help, escaped and reported to the customs officials, thus gaining a slight understanding of the content of the organization. The Philippine authorities are currently conducting strict investigations in order to eliminate the roots. It is reported that there are 70,000 overseas Chinese in the Philippines, but there are very few women, so some people smuggle them from China.</p>
<h3>Lawsuit over the Estate of the Orphan of Xue Baorun</h3>
<p>Xue Baobao's Biological Mother, Wang A'mei</p>
<p>Sues for Baobao to Equally Share the Estate</p>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reported that after the death of Xue Baorun, who made a fortune in pigments, the analysis of his estate involves a lawsuit in court. It is heard that in the court record of Gu Qiaolin's confession, it was stated that Xue Wang A'mei was Xue Baobao's biological mother, and her legal status has been determined. However, Xue Wang A'mei is a weak and helpless person, and Xue Baobao is an orphan without support. Recently, there have been well-known figures and party and state dignitaries who uphold humanitarianism and speak out righteously. Famous lawyers Dong Kang, Wu Jingxiong, Zhang Zhirang, and Pan Chenge have been hired by Xue Baobao and others to file a lawsuit in the French Concession. The lawsuit is recorded as follows: Plaintiff: Xue Baobao, legal representative: Xue Wang A'mei, Defendants: Xue Gu Qiaolin, Xue Sunshi, Xue Jiasheng, Xue Gansheng, Xue Yansheng, Xue Gensheng, for Gu Qiaolin and Xue Sunshi et al., inheritance of property involved in litigation, declaration of false claims, and fear of collusion and fraudulent circumstances, requesting a judgment ordering children to equally divide the entire estate. The reason is that Gu Qiaolin is an affair of the plaintiff's late father, Li Quan, and the legal representative is the plaintiff's biological mother, who has been serving in Qiaolin's place. The late father occasionally went to Qiaolin's place to walk around, because Qiaolin loved play and often disagreed. The biological mother never went out every day, and could always understand and cater to his wishes, and fell in love. From then on, he would come whenever he had the chance, and the biological mother became pregnant. On July 18 of the year of Ji, she gave birth to the plaintiff, who is still breastfeeding. The late father had revealed the above situation to his legal mother, Sun Taifuren, so his brothers Jiasheng and others knew that the plaintiff was indeed his biological father. The late father's love was constant, and he would come several times a day. This autumn, the father died, and Qiaolin falsely claimed that the plaintiff was born to her, and filed a lawsuit in the plaintiff's name. Now that the case has been summoned, and the hearing will be continued on the 14th of this month, the plaintiff should, in accordance with Article 31 of the Civil Procedure Law, list the defendants in that case, namely Qiaolin and the legal mother and brothers, and file a lawsuit for division of property. The plaintiff's father, daughter, legal mother, and brothers all recognize that this is an indisputable fact. However, since the interests are contrary to the legal mother, the biological mother should be the legal representative. For fear that Qiaolin and the legal mother, etc., know that the plaintiff has filed a lawsuit, there will be false claims, fraud, collusion, use of other cases, etc., and the biological mother cannot but file a lawsuit with Junxie in accordance with the law to order the children to equally divide the entire estate of the late father Li Quan in accordance with the law, and order the defendants to bear the costs of the lawsuit. presented to the court of law, January 13, 20th year of the Republic of China.</p>

<h3>Illicit Extortion Due to Filial Piety and Poverty</h3>
<p>Extortionists Fabricate Stories to Conceal Crimes</p>
<p>Both Chongming Residents Arrested</p>
<p>The Second Precinct, Second Substation of the Public Security Bureau in the Nanshi Wenmiao Road suddenly received a letter from the Ninth Team of the Nanshi District Security Corps stating that Yang Zaide, the owner of Wanxiangchun Pollen Store at No. 228 Fangbang Road, had repeatedly received extortion letters demanding large sums of money. The letters arranged a meeting at approximately 9 a.m. near the west entrance of Wenmiao Road. The merchant reported this to the Security Corps, requesting police assistance in the arrest. After reading the letter, Chief Guo immediately dispatched Inspector Liu Huansheng and several plainclothes officers to work with members of the Ninth Team, lying in wait at the location. After waiting patiently for two hours until approximately 12 p.m., they did not find anyone suspicious and returned to the station to report. Unexpectedly, yesterday morning, Ma Jun, an investigator from the Nanshi District Security Corps, and Wang Guixin, the secretary of the Ninth Team, came to the station claiming that the merchant Yang Zaide had received a third letter from the extortionists the previous day, arranging for payment to be made at approximately 9 a.m. today (yesterday) near the west entrance of Wenmiao Road. The letter instructed Yang to wrap the money in paper, place it in a green vegetable basket, and have a female servant carry the basket to the designated spot, where someone would come to collect it. Yang had followed these instructions, requesting that police be dispatched again to assist in the arrest. Chief Guo again sent Inspector Liu and several officers in disguise, along with members of the Seventh and Ninth Teams of the Security Corps, to lie in wait. At approximately 9:30 a.m., two men slowly approached, hesitating at the roadside. One of them approached the female servant and hurriedly took the paper package from the basket. Inspector Liu and the others, seeing that the time was right, rushed forward and apprehended both men, taking them to the station for questioning. One man identified himself as Huang Jianglang, age 40, from Chongming, admitting that he resorted to this measure due to his elderly mother and impoverished family. The other identified himself as Chen Kexun, age 26, from Chongming, claiming that he had intended to visit his mother at Anlefang in Penglai Road, Nanshi, and had been passing the Wenmiao Road fire station to exchange copper coins for a streetcar when he was mistakenly arrested, denying any knowledge of Huang. Based on their confessions, Chief Guo believed that since both Chen and Huang were from Chongming and had coincidentally met, hesitating at the roadside, there was a strong suspicion of their involvement. He immediately prepared a document to submit to the Judicial Section today for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Daughter Married Without Mother's Knowledge</h3>
<p>Arranged by the Uncle</p>
<p>Deeply Disappointed After Marriage</p>
<p>Mother Files a Lawsuit</p>
<p>Seeking to Declare the Marriage Invalid</p>
<p>Shen Yunxia, a woman from Wumen, lost her father at a young age and lived at home with her mother. When she grew older, her uncle brought her to Shanghai to study at the Shanghai Girls' School on Taoerfei Road. Two years ago, at the age of 29, her uncle arranged her marriage to Zhang Keming, the son of his friend. Zhang was also a handsome young man, previously employed at the yarn exchange. The wedding was held on February 18th at the Daxin Hotel on Fuzhou Road. The woman's mother, residing in her hometown, knew nothing of this. After the marriage, the woman frequently returned to Suzhou, but never mentioned the matter, so her mother still believed she was studying in Shanghai. However, Zhang has recently become depraved, addicted to opium and gambling, day and night, frequenting gambling dens and opium dens. Yunxia tried to dissuade him without success, returning home in tears, unhappy. Her mother suspected something and questioned her thoroughly. The daughter told the truth. The mother, as the head of the household and regarding her daughter's marriage as a significant event, believed it was unacceptable to arrange a marriage without her consent and that she could not recognize it. Therefore, she came to Shanghai with her daughter and hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the Special District Court, seeking to declare the marriage invalid according to the first half of Section 2 of Article 669 and Article 668 of the Civil Code. The case was heard by Judge Yang the previous day. The plaintiff, Shen Wang, stated the grounds for the lawsuit, and Yunxia also testified that she did not want to marry at the time but could not disobey her uncle. She stated that she did not wish to live with Zhang. The judge, noting the defendant's absence, ordered a further summons for the defendant and the woman's uncle to appear for a continued hearing.</p>
<h3>Chinese Merchants' Tram Company Maintains Original Gaochangmiao Route</h3>
<p>Army Arsenal and Shipyard Send Letters of Inquiry</p>
<p>City Public Security Bureau Intervenes to Mediate</p>
<p>The Chinese Merchants' Tram Company planned to shorten the Gaochangmiao tram route to Bansongyuan. The Army Arsenal and Shipyard sent letters of inquiry. Details of the company's reasons for shortening the route and the negotiations with the Army Arsenal are recorded below:</p>
<p>Reasons for Shortening the Route: Since 1927, the Chinese Merchants' Tram Company has had an agreement with the Army Arsenal and Shipyard regarding employee fares. Until the end of 1930, the agreement stipulated that all Arsenal workers would pay 150 yuan per month for tram fares, while officers would pay 1 yuan per month. The company would issue tram passes valid throughout the Chinese territory, without additional charges. The Jiangnan Shipyard had a similar arrangement. The tram company believed that Gaochangmiao was a remote location and that besides the employees of the two institutions, few other passengers used the tram. Furthermore, the agreement with the two institutions had expired. Therefore, the company planned to shorten the Gaochangmiao route, ending it at Bansongyuan.</p>
<p>Negotiations with the Two Institutions: Guo Chengen, the director of the Army Arsenal, and Chen Shaokuan, the director of the Jiangnan Shipyard, repeatedly received requests from employees to persuade the tram company to reconsider its decision to shorten the route. They argued that while tram service was a business, its primary purpose was to facilitate transportation, and that although the agreement had expired, a new agreement could be drawn up with adjusted fares. Therefore, they sent letters to the Chinese Merchants' Tram Company requesting that it not suddenly shorten the original route.</p>
<p>Two Institutions Intervene to Mediate: Before responding to the Army Arsenal and Shipyard, the Chinese Merchants' Tram Company feared that employees in the Gaochangmiao area would oppose the change, leading to disputes. Therefore, they requested the Public Security Bureau and the Public Works Bureau to mediate with the Shipyard and Army Arsenal. Subsequently, the Public Security Bureau agreed to mediate, stipulating that until the matter was resolved, the tram company must maintain the original route and not shorten it without authorization, so as not to impede transportation. Employee fares would continue to be handled as before, and a revised agreement would be negotiated between the parties.</p>
<h3>Guild Opposes Increased Room Tax</h3>
<p>Guild Association Convenes Meeting to Discuss Measures</p>
<p>The French Concession has suddenly increased the original room tax for various inns from four cents per room to six cents. All innkeepers believe that this is difficult to bear due to operational difficulties, and they have unanimously requested the Innkeepers' Guild to intervene. Yesterday, the Guild convened a meeting of its entire committee to discuss the matter. All committee members attended, chaired by Cai Rucai, who explained the purpose of the meeting and invited discussion on how to proceed. The following measures were agreed upon: (1) A letter will be sent to the French Municipal Council outlining the situation reported by the members and the reasons for not being able to pay the increased tax, requesting the immediate cancellation of the increase to reduce the burden. (2) A declaration will be issued detailing the difficulties faced by the innkeeping industry, seeking unanimous support from all sectors. (3) Letters will be sent to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association, the Chamber of Commerce, and the five Chinese directors and nine committee members of the French Concession, seeking assistance. (4) All committee members are notified to await the resolution of the Guild's negotiations. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<h3>Two Courts Establish Party Doctrine Research Association</h3>
<p>Under party governance, the staff of political, military, and police agencies should have a deep understanding of the doctrine. However, while many current civil servants understand the Party doctrine, some inevitably lack a thorough understanding. To instill Party doctrine, the Central Executive Committee resolved that all political, military, and police agencies inside and outside the capital must establish Party Doctrine Research Associations, so that the staff of these agencies study the Party doctrine. Several provisional regulations for studying Party doctrine were promulgated and issued by the National Government for implementation. Xu Weizhen, President of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, and Wang Zhennan, Chief Prosecutor, after receiving the order, are now engaged in organizing the Party Doctrine Research Association. It is stipulated that all staff of the Branch, from the President and Chief Prosecutor to the clerks, are researchers and are divided into four groups: the Civil Court and Civil Division as one group, the Criminal Court and Criminal Division as one group, the Secretariat and various sections and clerks as one group, and the Procuratorate as one group. A director is appointed for each group by the President and the Chief Prosecutor. The research methods are divided into two types: (1) Reading. Each researcher reads independently, marking or taking notes on the Party doctrine books. These are submitted every Monday for review by the directors of each group. If a researcher fails to submit their reading, the director should report it to the President or the Chief Prosecutor for follow-up. (2) Discussion. A discussion should be held every Monday morning after the memorial service, with a two-month period for each study, after which all researchers gather for a test. Those with the worst performance are cautioned by the President and the Chief Prosecutor. It is intended that all staff clearly understand the doctrine of the Premier, so as not to disappoint the Central Executive Committee’s painstaking efforts in establishing this association. Furthermore, the Special District Court, which shares the same location as the Branch, has always followed the Branch's lead in all measures and reforms. Therefore, it is reported that President Yang of the Special Court and the Chief Prosecutor also plan to follow suit and prepare to organize a Party Doctrine Research Association.</p>
<h3>Butterfly and Snow Appear Together on Screen</h3>
<p>Premiering Today at the Central Grand Theatre</p>
<p>The matter of the film star Hu Die breaking off her engagement with her fiancé has not yet reached a definitive conclusion. However, many relatives and friends of both parties have emerged to mediate as Ru Zhonglian. But to this day, the two have not reconciled, showing that their opinions are irreconcilable. Outsiders still cannot predict the outcome. Hu Die and Lin Xuehuai were extremely affectionate. When Lin Yunhuai was an actor at the Youlian Film Company, he introduced Hu Die to the company as the star of "Autumn Fan's Lament". Therefore, Hu Die's rise to fame on the silver screen is partly due to this film. Lin Xuehuai also played a key role in the film, one as an abandoned woman, the other as a chivalrous youth. The performance of the two was very profound. This film can be regarded today as a nostalgic item for the love of Hu and Lin. Those who know about the dissolution of the Butterfly and Snow contract must also be eager to see the contents of this film, so as to know what the artistic scenes of Hu and Lin's love were like in the past. It is reported that starting today, this film will be shown for three consecutive days at the Central Grand Theatre on Six Ma Road. The Jimei Girls' Song and Dance Troupe, which recently won awards from the Central Party Department and famous figures, will also perform the recently arranged comic song and dance drama "Villagers Dancing at the Ballroom."</p>

<h3>Liuhang Security Corps Members Fight Fiercely with Thieves</h3>
<p>Two Robber Leaders Arrested</p>
<p>Many Accomplices Revealed</p>
<p>At around 11 p.m. the other night, a large gang of thieves suddenly appeared in Liuhang Township in Baoshan County's southwest region, intending to rob a certain family who were celebrating a wedding. It is reported that these thieves were a well-organized group, led by someone named Gao and assisted by someone named Shi. The person responsible for communication was a so-called "liaison officer" named Chen Jingtao. Their plan was to first rob the wedding family in the area, and then to proceed to the Zhang family in Yanghang (who also had a wedding). That night, Gao led forty to fifty thugs, all armed with firearms, towards Liuhang when they encountered members of the local security corps on patrol. The corps members, suspecting their motives, ordered them to stop. Unexpectedly, the thieves opened fire. The corps members returned fire. The thieves, thinking that their plot had been exposed, dared not linger and fled, shouting. The corps members pursued and fired back. Yanghang Security Corps members who heard the gunfire realized that there was a robbery and went in the direction of the sound, apprehending one person on the way and taking him back to their headquarters. After interrogation by Corps Commander Yan Songtang, the man identified himself as Chen Jingtao, a local tailor. He was evasive about the rest of his information. While he was being questioned, the Liuhang Corps called to report the robbery and that the leader, Gao, had been apprehended, while the other thieves had fled north, requesting assistance in intercepting them. Corps Commander Yan immediately sent corps members to transport the captured Chen Jingtao to Liuhang, where he was questioned along with Gao. They revealed the names of many accomplices, all located in Jiaoqiao, about four li south of Yanghang town. Yesterday, Corps Commander Yan sent many corps members to the area, capturing Ge Baolin and Ge Boan. The others, Ge Abe and Yang, had already fled upon hearing the news and have not been apprehended.

<h3>Strange Case of Zhu Xiuying's Abduction</h3>
<p>Implicating Wang Wu, Yao Chen, and Chen Zhiming</p>
<p>Zhu Limin, a 36-year-old man from Funing, lives at No. 56 in the west lane of Haichaosi South Street outside the Xiaonanmen in Shanghai. His wife, Jiang, is the same age as Zhu and has a daughter named Xiuying, who is 18 years old. She works in a hosiery factory in Tanjialong, knitting socks. Two women who work at the same factory, Wang Wu and Yao Chen, are good friends with Xiuying. The two women often visited Zhu's house to chat. In December of last year, Xiuying went to work at the factory after lunch but never returned home. Zhu was anxious and searched everywhere but could not find her. The two women, Wang and Yao, went to Zhu's house and said that Xiuying's disappearance was not serious and that she would return in a few days. However, she has not been seen since. Zhu became suspicious of the two women and took them to the First Precinct, First Substation for investigation. Later, a man named Chen Zhiming sent a letter to Zhu's house saying that Xiuying was currently at a certain place on Kader Road and that he should not be impatient. Zhu received the information and went to the address yesterday, found the girl, and brought her and Chen Zhiming to Nanshi, then took them to the substation for questioning. During the preliminary hearing, Zhu Xiuying testified that on a certain day last month, she went to work at the factory after lunch. As soon as she arrived at the factory gate, she saw a black car parked there. She did not pay attention to it. Suddenly, Chen Zhiming and the two women, Wang and Yao, jumped out of the car. One of them held a gun and forced her into the car, which sped away. Afterwards, she lived with Chen. Chen Zhiming, age 35, from Tongzhou, testified that he was a car driver. Xiuying was introduced to him by a "Big Sister" and was willing to marry him. However, recently the "Big Sister" suddenly wanted to marry Xiuying to someone else. Xiuying did not want to and vowed to stay with him. He could not refuse her request, so he set up a small home on Kader Road. Wang Wu, age 26, from Yancheng, residing in Youchel Lane, Pingan Bridge, South Wharf, and Yao Chen, age 36, from Tongzhou, residing at No. 56, Xiaoputuo Bridge, denied all the details provided by Xiuying. The case is strange, and the statements are contradictory. They were ordered to remain in detention pending investigation and further processing.</p>
<h3>Ma Liumei Files for Divorce</h3>
<p>Someone Testifies That Her Husband Committed Adultery</p>
<p>Ma Liumei, a local young woman, hired lawyer Gu Shouyi to sue her husband, Ma Fulai, in the District Court for (1) extravagance, (2) failure to fulfill cohabitation duties, and (3) adultery, requesting a divorce. The trial was not concluded and a mediation was ordered. Witness Jin Baochu was summoned to court for further verification. Yesterday morning, Judge Yang Keqian continued the trial. The plaintiff, Ma Liumei, testified that the mediation had not been successful and that she wanted a divorce and requested a ruling. The defendant, Ma Fulai, testified that he gambled small games of mahjong and frequented entertainment venues, but he was not extravagant and returned home every day to live with the plaintiff. As for the adultery, it was completely unfounded, so he did not want a divorce. Witness Jin Baochu, age 44, from Minhang, currently residing in Songjiang, testified that the defendant had indeed committed adultery with his wife, Ni. On November 18th of last year, the two lovebirds were in the middle of a romantic encounter when he caught them in the act and turned them over to the Public Security Bureau, who transferred them to the Procuratorate. On December 17th of the same year, he divorced his wife (referring to Ni). At this point, the interrogating officer questioned the defendant: "You said that you did not commit adultery. Have you heard what Jin Baochu said?" The defendant was speechless. The interrogating officer then invited Prosecutor Wu to the court to state his opinion. Finally, lawyer Gu stood up to make a statement. The interrogating officer announced the end of the debate and adjourned to await the verdict.</p>

<p>Water Pipe Leakage Obstructing Traffic</p>
<p>Recently, water pipe leakage in front of No. 96 Feihong Road, Yucai Road intersection, Zhabei, has caused water to overflow onto the road surface, obstructing vehicles and pedestrians.
