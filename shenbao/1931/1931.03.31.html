<p>中央黨部　三十日上午九時中央黨部舉行總理紀念週到中委蔣中正·邵元冲·馬超俊·余井塘·陳立夫等及黨部職員·來賓共八百餘人由蔣中正主席行禮後即作報告如次「昨天參加革命先烈紀念典禮感想萬千三二九一役可謂革命正氣伸張的一個大紀念這種革命精神表示完全爲主義爲民族而奮鬥絶對不夾雜一絲一毫的私心私見所以能種下後來成功的基礎留遺着極偉大的影響我們後死者不獨應繼續他們的遺志還應該發揚光大他們的事業使革命目的完全實現黨的整個歷史是各個黨員以犧牲奮鬥來造成而每一個同志的革命歷史也必須要全體共同來扶持例如陳炯明他便是參加三二九日之役的當時一般同志都異常的期望他即總理對他也多方與以寛假不料自</p>
<p>民七以後陳炯明所作所爲往往對總理貌合神離很明顯的爲要達他自私自利的目的不但不努力革命而且要阻撓革命總理爲顧全革命全局幾次想予以制裁免他的職但黨内一般同志都表示反對後來陳炯明逆跡昭著公然指揮叛兵圍攻觀音山總統府總理幾遭不測這種顯明的叛逆凡有血氣之倫莫不</p>
<p>聞之髮指但還有同志背地議論總理不應對陳炯明迫之太甚此完全證明當時革命同志們没有把公私是非分别淸楚祗知道有私人情感而置主義與黨國於不顧倘使當日大家都能把這一點公私之界分别淸楚及早依朱執信同志的主張則革命大局何至遭受嚴重的頓挫使總理不能及身見革命的成功而且陳炯明旣然曾經參加過三二九日光榮之一役如果同志中間早知道愛人以德不以私情私誼行其姑息則陳炯明也何至自絶於本黨可犄陳炯明後來之身敗名裂未始不是一般同志不能替他保全過去歷史</p>
<p>所致的革命是艱難嚴重的事業受不得一些頓挫所以應完全效法黃花崗諸先烈公而忘私的精神在全局的利害和嚴正的是非上着想不然雖有十分偉大的領袖像我們總理而革命仍不免要受頓挫革命黨並不是不講情感本黨的結合尤其是在于同志間親愛精誠的圑結不過本黨所講的情感要完全築基於革命大義之上應該先問公共的利害而後再及私人的情誼總之革命是永遠奮鬥的第一要認淸大義的所在第二要不斷的努力吾人因紀念黃花崗的先烈而感想到革命歷史的保持實不是一件容易的事情必須要自已奮不顧身的精進不懈而同志之間尤必須大公無私完全以大義相責勉然後本黨的革命歷史上終能一天天發揚光大革命的目的才能夠完成還有我們最近最要的工作就是五月五日的國民會議總理臨終的遺囑就是開國民會議·和廢除不平等條約兩件大事國民會議中間就是廢除不平等條約和訓政時間的約法爲惟一的要案這兩件事實爲我們中華民族竽死存亡的關頭我們黨員和全國的國民應該十分注意對此兩點迅速發揮自已的主</p>
<p>張來供獻于黨國以定黨國百年大計尤其對於不平等條約一層我們於此國民會議之前在此三十五日廢除不平等條約運動之中就可以認識各國眞實的態度那一個是我們的朋友那一國是我們的仇敵那一國是壓迫我們那一國是扶助我們並可以于此斷定望我們全國國民和全黨同志對於這點尤須格外注意」云云旋即禮成散會</p>

<p>有道鼓勵有方用當其才如此始能使政治有辦法社會事業可以發展關於敎養有道即除殘廢者外苟能培養有方無論智愚皆可成材出爲世用現在黨治之下一切政治根據三民主義及總理遺敎制成政策及方針由黨交與政府去</p>
<p>辦政府根據黨所定之政策和方針去按步實施始可表現黨的精神但政治之改造亦須分先後緩急依照人力財力依次完成故敎育方面亦須依照需要培養人才從前許多留學生歸國後因種種關係無可發抒其才學實非經濟之道現在應體察國内各種事業之緩急然後依此原則培養各種實用人材最近數年中我人應積極努力者有下列數事（一）完成地方自治以爲訓政之基礎（二）普及敎</p>
<p>育再進而培養各種專門人材（三）發展並改良農業以裕民食我人須集合全國人力財力於近數年中使上述三項事業有顯明之成績然後對其他各種事業相機進行政府對人力財力用極經濟方法去進行敎育方面亦依此方針而培養之如此人能各盡其才使政治基礎日趨穏定文化及建設事業漸臻發展然後分工合作自可完成一切云云演詞全稿正在整理中</p>

<h3 id="c144">瞿頌嘉被綁脫險經過 <a href="#c144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>綁匪已逮獲男女五人</p>
<p>瞿頌嘉將往外埠休養</p>
<p>主使犯爲顧惠昌</p>
<p>保衛圑供給手槍</p>
<p>綁票資本一千元</p>
<p>每次在公園密議</p>
<p>本埠南市小東門外中國銀行分行行長瞿頌嘉於本月十六日早晨八時許由家乘自備包車赴行辦公詎甫坐上包車突被匪徒綁架而去當時因家屬之請求故各報均未披露刻聞瞿君已於昨日脫險而歸特將經過一切詳情補錄於次</p>
<p>分行長坐包車　瞿君現年三十四歲本地人爲小東門開設瞿長順魚行之次子現任南市中國銀行分行行長職家住南市一區二分所轄境東姚家弄升和里三號瞿君年雖少壯而性頗儉勤僅備包車一輛以代步本月十六日瞿晨起盥洗進點畢即乘包車擬赴行辦公車夫江洪慶（通州人年三十三歲去歲舊歷九月初七日由喬家浜丁宅車夫湯阿福介紹而來）正將瞿子送至學校返家車停弄口專候主人命駕</p>
<p>干預小便被綁　至八時三刻瞿下樓登車車夫正將車梗拽起尚未舉步忽見一人身着元色華絲葛長袍步入弄内形似拽衣小便瞿見狀即呼斥該處非溲溺之所詎此人即奔至車前先將車夫胸衣扭住袖出手槍喝令停車同時又由弄口跑進兩人即將瞿拽下包車嚇勿聲張兩人挽住瞿之兩臂擁出弄口拖入預停路旁一汽車内風馳電製而去包車夫亟返宅奔告瞿之胞兄再待出弄視察人車已杳如黃鹤瞿之家屬立即具情投報該管一區二分所請求弋緝</p>
<p>突出一封書信　先是乍浦路大隆汽車公司於當日早晨六時五十分忽來一年約二十餘歲之西裝少年向該公司租車一輛單送至法租界福開森路言定租費一元五角少年即出洋二元賬房找還五角即命汽車夫卓士良甬人年三十二歲駕駛租界第一七六八八號市號碼第五一一號汽車送往詎車抵福開森路勞利蘭路轉角少年即命停車由衣袋内取出信件一封命汽車夫送至附近牛奶棚内車夫未允正在推讓之際突由路旁竄出兩人</p>
<p>借車實行綁票　兩人躍出後各　　出手槍迫令車人下車禁止聲張隨將其掖至附近松林内一併坐於地下而西裝少年即自行司機將汽車開逸無踪兩人監視汽車夫約一小時之久復用麻繩將車夫手足反縛兩人一齊逸去車夫挣扎良久將繩卸去當即奔報善鐘路捕房捕頭立即電話分告公安局及公共租界各捕房注意截獲同時一區二分聞得此訊方知綁瞿之汽車即係匪徒由大隆租得者</p>
<p>誤報汽車號碼　當法捕房分電各處捕房時誤將五一一號爲五七一號而公安局督察處據報即立派偵緝隊長盧英帶同領班齊海田·偵緝員周培三·張興隆·韓瑞生·等先至公用局檢閱汽車登記簿查得五七一號爲大東門中華路五八一號阮記汽車行所有當即逕至該行將五七一號汽車扣留該行百般解釋盧隊長復電詢一區二分所方知錯誤乃即乘五七一號汽車擬往乍浦路大隆汽車公司詢問眞相</p>
<p>飽受一塲虚驚　其時公共租界各捕房亦同時聞悉華界發生綁案而所得報告汽車之號碼亦誤爲市五七一號故各要隘已加派中西探捕注意截獲而當時盧隊長等正乘五七一號汽車駛抵白渡橋該處探捕一見該號汽車駛到復見車内坐有糾糾者五六人認爲匪車無疑衆人手槍一齊舉起將車扣留雖經一再解釋終至捕房一走述明誤會方始恍然但當時緊張情形衆探員已飽受虚驚矣</p>
<p>索價五十萬元　瞿被綁後家屬迭接匪函五封索價五十萬元市公安局陳局長立飭所屬限日破案故各區偵騎四出旋探得此案綁匪有名彭姚治者（即唐莫旁）匿迹十六舖一帶當爲市公安局六區巡官徐濤查悉報由該管一區總署派出官警及偵緝員領班董明德偵緝員袁海山余茂隆呂安普任壽芝徐玉麟等偵查多日得以拘獲該匪帶回預審時彭匪供年二十六歲啟東人去年十一月間從鎭江來申寄宿在十六舖南康旅館由友人小袁介紹得與顧惠昌相識云云</p>
<p>主使犯顧惠昌　續供顧曾勸我加入彼之黨内做一票大買賣據稱資本自有人出給手槍則由住居浦東慶寗寺附近充任川沙保衛圑圑長之陳小炳（又名連初即綽號陳矮子）者供給我聞而推辭不允惟後來我却代爲介紹兩友到彼處人黨做買賣等語當飭原班警探等馳往浦東川沙縣境查提陳小炳陳確在該處開設肉莊及水　號詎料已被知風逃避繼又返滬復在小南門海潮寺顧家廰偵獲主使犯顧惠昌及顧之姘婦沈氏</p>
<p>法國公園密議　一區偵緝員旣將主使犯顧惠昌（綽號長脚三十四歲本地人）及姘婦沈氏（三十九歲本地人）拘獲後詳加嚴訊顧犯直認糾同小楊張二郎等五人共帶手槍三支將瞿綁到最初藏於龍華魏家花四園凡四日第四日晚間用小船將肉票送往川沙鄉間又住兩日因滬上風聲緊急又將其藏至距離川沙東南約十二里之湯家宅惟此次綁瞿之本錢由堂兄顧仲安所出共費一千元正手槍三支係由川沙保衛圑員陳小炳（即陳連初又名矮子）供給每次密議均在法國公園云云</p>
<p>匪婦述明所在　偵緝員據供後當即帶同顧犯及長警十餘名連夜過浦命顧領捉詎顧狡詐多端將衆探警奔波迄夜東拉西扯始終不將眞正藏票地點指出衆探警精疲力竭而返第二次又同該犯過浦尋找復無效果最後乃係匪婦沈氏述明所在始於昨日直接至湯家宅營救詎肉票已於前晚（二十八日）被匪等送至上海祗拘獲婦人湯張氏·看票張二郎·二名帶歸嚴訊張氏供年六十五歲川沙人祗憶廢歴三月二十三日由婿陳連初（即小炳）送來客人一名至前晚（二十八日）復由陳命丈夫湯志榮等三人將客人送回上海餘不知情</p>
<p>肉票確已出險　詰之張二郎年　　二十八歲崇明人直認看守肉票不諱並稱當肉票藏在湯家宅時連同看票者均頭蒙布罩各人均不辨面貌至於將票送歸之故聞係因風聲緊急不能再久云云詰之肉票何在據供實不知情探員等乃至瞿宅探問據家屬云頃間確由瞿本人打來電話據云現已出險寄宿友人處暫不歸家稍待數日即須至外埠休養但究在何處家中亦不得而知云云探員等見家屬旣不願述明何在但旣已出險亦無深究之必要乃返報區長</p>
<p>嚴緝在逃同黨　一區陳區長聞悉肉票旣已出險遂將一千案犯詳錄供詞呈送總局核辦一面飭令所屬追獲在逃同黨務獲解究惟前日顧犯忽然僞共肉票藏於法租界環龍路十二號顧宅内一區探員曾會同法捕房探捕前往搜捕但毫無影踪聞該處即係第一主使犯顧仲安之住所惟顧業已聞風遠竄矣</p>
<h3 id="c145">聞所未聞之六啞涉訟記 <a href="#c145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>爲丁五百元債務</p>
<p>六啞結隊往五區</p>
<p>口不能說以筆代</p>
<p>錢債民事未受理</p>
<p>林吉姆亦六啞之一</p>
<p>聽訟斷獄案牘勞形堂呵隸喝何　可言然昨晨五區公安局之一幕啞人官司似不可謂非例外也除承審者外一堂啞子共有六名審訊對答用筆代舌斯固奇矣而其更有凑巧者則銀幕上的啞情人林吉姆亦牽涉在内與啞同志五人同時出席於公安局預審處也啞子所訟事關錢財因其中有一「靠不住的啞子」意圖賴債故爾啞啞互扭到局求判然結果因「事關民事本區未便受理仰自投法院起訴可也」六名啞子悄悄無聲怏怏外出至於今後能否大家抱住其本來之靜默態度免去公堂對簿之一舉則不敢斷言矣今姑以昨晨之事誌之如後</p>
<p>啞子借錢啞人擔保　有啞子胡同剛者去春代友人向蘇某借欵三百元當時立有借據二分起息並由同病之秦際平·徐鑑生·郭明理·于原卿·等四啞吧担保蓋亦「恐口無憑立此存照」之意也其後胡同剛因自已結婚欵項不足亦向蘇某借洋二百元另立借據並且一客不煩二主仍請四啞子從中作保於是此四人者雖默不一聲而五百元錢債之責任固已輕輕負在各個肩上矣兩借據轉瞬到期胡及其友分文無着債主無法祗得向保人秦·徐·郭·于·四啞相催四啞則轉向胡啞逼討無如日復一日仍無着落俗云「不怕兇只怕窮」四啞因担保受累走頭無路眞所謂啞子吃黃連有苦無處說也無已昨日上午十一時許只得扭胡同剛往五區公安局送去控以賴債不還當由郭區員訊問一番</p>
<p>一幕用筆的啞審問　除秦·徐·郭·于·及債户胡同剛·五啞子外何爲而有林吉姆在其中林於此事本無關係惟因林現任黃某律師之助理且與各啞不無瓜葛友誼因亦參予其中而成爲六啞之訟結隊直向五區公安局而去夫啞吧涉訟其事本非不經見者特如林等六人之純粹啞子隊往公安局起訴者則破天荒事耳當時各啞指手劃脚裝腔做勢而結果則效力等於零良以公安局各員司對于鞫案决讞固屬常事然見此一班口欲言而力不從心者亦惟徒喚奈何不如聾啞學校之敎員或尚有若干辦法可以應用也最後郭區員發給各啞子紙筆令各繕寫來歷及起訴事實各啞子乃伸紙吹毫各以胸中隠情吐之楮上</p>
<p>鴉雀無聲風平浪靜　保人秦際平·徐鑑生·郭明理·等均在寳山路商務印書館照相部做事債户胡同剛亦係同事郭區員每一發問亦用紙筆作媒介凡有所言均代之以文字惟遇意賅而情節簡略者則亦頷首舉臂以示唯否故雖一堂十餘人亦殊靜悄悄地鴉雀無聲據筆談所得胡同剛因一月十日結婚花費銀錢甚多現在無力還債債欵中三百元係紹介别人所借二百元自所用秦·徐等四保人則指爲「胡靠不住」「狡滑」·有圖賴之意故而扭控旋郭區員代爲劃策命胡每月拔還四十元則一年之内可以淸償矣詎紙條示至胡之面前此啞君雙眉一縐頻頻蹙額口雖不言而摇頭示意作不能狀繼用筆書無力拔還結果郭區員祇得告以錢債官司事關民事可向法院起訴本署不能受理各啞子視條後乃略做遵從之手勢摇身蹩足出門而去據某君語記者此六人者進門之時腹中似有一肚皮的話要說眉目之間不無憤憤之色然質訊之時用筆代舌默不作聲態度之佳得未曾有乃其去也亦彬彬無語故此一幕官司亦可謂之「風平浪靜」耳若在非啞之人則呌囂煩閙不可言狀矣</p>

<p>Chairman Chiang's Address</p>
<p>Nanjing - The National Government held a medal conferral ceremony on the morning of the 30th. Those receiving medals included four division commanders: Xu Tingyao, Wu Siyu, head of the Capital Police Department, Lin Wei, chief of the General Headquarters' Staff Office, Jin Handing, division commander of the 12th Division, Zhou Zhi, infantry commander of the 1st Training Division, Zhang Xiqian, director of the General Headquarters' Adjutant Office, and Wu Han, chief of staff of the 1st Training Division, and Xiang Zhizhuang, artillery commander. Chairman Chiang's address briefly stated that the officers had sacrificed and struggled for the Party and the nation, facing death many times, enduring hardship and difficulty. Many subordinates had died, and they had faced many dangers to have today's medal conferral. He reminded them of the difficulties of Dr. Sun Yat-sen in creating the Republic of China, and the greatness of the sacrifices of the martyrs. He asked how everyone should encourage themselves and work hard to be worthy of their sacrifices and live up to the significance of the government's medal conferral. He hoped that they would work even harder in the future to complete the mission of the revolution. The meeting then adjourned. (Central News Agency dispatch, 30th)</p>

<p>Nanjing - Preparations for Eurasia Aviation have been underway for a long time. Recently, two Junkers aircraft conducted test flights to Manchuli from Shanghai, achieving excellent results. They will fly from Beiping to Shanghai soon. The official launch date was originally scheduled for April 1st. However, because the radio stations at Nanjing, Jinan, Beiping, and Dolon are still being equipped, the launch is expected to take place by mid-May at the latest. The postage and fares will follow the standards set by the China National Aviation Corporation. However, passenger fares still need further discussion before a decision can be made. In the future, negotiations regarding the passage of aircraft through Soviet Siberia will be handled by the German government with the Soviet Union until the Sino-Soviet resumption of diplomatic relations is settled. If the Soviet Union does not recognize Sino-European mail, it will temporarily be forwarded by post. (Special dispatch, 30th)</p>

<p>A Solution is Expected Before May</p>
<p>Nanjing - At the Ministry of Foreign Affairs memorial week on the morning of the 30th, Fan Guang reported on the legal rights negotiations. Negotiations with Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands are progressing steadily, and France is also making progress. If there are no special obstacles, a thorough solution is expected before May. In addition, regarding the legal rights negotiations with Japan, recent reports state that Japan's relationship with China is different from that of other countries, and there will be special arrangements. This is a misunderstanding. The Sino-Japanese Commercial Treaty has long expired, and these legal rights naturally disappear with the treaty. Subsequent new treaties should be based on the principle of international equality and mutual benefit. There is no so-called special arrangement. Our side is determined and will never treat Japan differently. If the Japanese side has selfish and self-interested views and makes unreasonable demands on our country, our government will never recognize them in order to safeguard national sovereignty. (Special dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>Nanjing - A key figure in diplomatic circles said that the legal rights negotiations with Britain and the United States have made relatively good progress, while France is progressing slightly slower.

<p>Since the Gandhi-Irwin Pact took shape, the situation in India has eased somewhat. Since the execution of the three patriots sparked riots, the situation has become slightly tense again, which is suspected to affect the agreement. Judging from the situation of the All-India Congress, the attitude of the Indians is still relatively moderate. Although the Gandhi-Irwin Pact has not yet been discussed at today's Congress, it is reported that the plan has been accepted by the Congress Committee and should not undergo any changes. This only concerns the agreement itself. As for the issue of Indian independence, President Patel has made a solemn statement, saying that today's Congress still maintains the same position as the Lahore Congress in demanding complete independence for India, and there is no concession. However, at this time of struggle, we do not immediately refuse to cooperate with Britain or other countries, etc. Although his words seem more moderate than before, the intention to demand complete independence is very firm. In other words, it is only a temporary truce, leaving room for negotiation. Therefore, in reality, although the Indian issue has not deteriorated, it cannot be said to have progressed. Moreover, according to Reuters, the All-India Congress Committee adopted a resolution today expressing opposition to the British government's plan to separate Burma from India, saying that Britain's forcing Burma to separate from India seems to aim to permanently control Burma so that Burma can combine with Singapore to form a stronghold for Britain to implement imperialism in East Asia. Burma has oil resources and occupies a strategic location. Britain is using this to develop, which has far-reaching implications for the Far East. The East and other countries will be harmed, etc. The statements are very important. A new dispute has been discovered in the issue of Indian independence. It is not only no progress has been made.</p>

Therefore, it convened a meeting of the Construction Committee and other seven agencies to jointly request the Boxer Indemnity Management Board to negotiate with the Material Procurement Committee to allow it to arbitrarily purchase ordinary supplies in Britain and investigate goods with prices equal to or lower than those in China for purchase and resale to domestic merchants at the original price to recover the funds it should receive.

<p>Many Resolutions Passed</p>
<p>Agreement Between Winston and Gandhi Not Discussed</p>
<p>Demand for Independence Will Not Be Abandoned</p>
<p>Strong Opposition to Separation of India and Burma</p>
<p>National News Agency, Karachi, 29th: The All-India Congress opened here today with 30,000 delegates in attendance. President Patel, in his address, solemnly declared that the position of the All-India Congress today is the same as it was at the Lahore Conference when it decided to demand complete independence for India, without any concessions. However, this demand for independence does not mean that we should stubbornly refuse to cooperate with Britain or other countries during the struggle (following Reuters telegram). Subsequently, several resolutions were passed, previously established by the Working Committee and the Resolutions Committee, including a request for the immediate release of all political prisoners, lamenting the religious disturbances in Kanpur, and sending personnel to investigate the causes. The plenary session also passed a resolution stating, "The spirit of sacrifice of Bhagat Singh and others is admirable, but it is regrettable that they were hanged. The All-India Congress will not be involved in political violence." The agreement between Winston and Gandhi was not discussed today, but having been accepted by the committee, it should not be difficult to pass.</p>
<p>Reuters, Karachi, 30th: The All-India Congress Committee today adopted a resolution stating that the British government's plan to separate Burma from India has far-reaching implications for the Far East. The resolution, adopted by the Topics Committee, stated that Britain's move to force Burma to secede from India seems to be aimed at permanently controlling Burma, combining it with Singapore to form a stronghold for British imperialism in East Asia. Burma has oil fields and its terrain is strategic. Britain wants to maintain Burma as its colony, using its natural resources to develop its imperialist goals, thereby endangering other countries in the East. The All-India Congress registers its strong opposition to this policy. Nehru, when moving the resolution, declared that the world is now pursuing neither gold nor silver; oil is more valuable than these two materials. There is a reason for the recent struggle between Turkey and Britain for the Mosul oil fields.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Briand's Remarks Trigger German Reactions <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Promoting the Pan-European League on One Hand</p>
<p>Undermining the German-Austrian Tax Agreement on the Other</p>
<p>German Newspapers Criticize His Ambiguous Attitude, Only Knowing to Benefit Himself</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 29th: French Foreign Minister Briand's speech in the Senate on Saturday, in which he vehemently attacked the negotiation of the German-Austrian partial tax agreement, has aroused the anger of the entire German public opinion, all pointing out that Briand's remarks are unfounded and extremely unfair. Even the Germania newspaper, which is very close to Prime Minister Brüning and has always been engaged in German-French cooperation, said that Briand is very forgetful and has completely forgotten his previous Pan-European League plan. Is his previous attitude true or false? How can the same trend of planning promote and advocate what is beneficial to himself, and despise and undermine what is slightly unfavorable to himself? Briand was still advocating a few months ago how European countries should eliminate suspicion and establish economic unity and a consolidated group. Thinking about it today, it is incomprehensible what the true meaning of his argument is. The newspaper concluded that Briand said that German-French relations have now suffered a major blow. Unfortunately, his words are true, except that this blow came from Briand's reckless attack. The fault is not on our side, because Germany and Austria only adopted the plan that Geneva and Paris wanted to implement but failed to do so, and it was done in accordance with the wishes of the majority of the people in both countries.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 29th: German political circles were surprised to hear French Foreign Minister Briand's remarks in the Senate regarding the German-Austrian customs agreement, considering his words to be unfounded. Although there is no formal criticism, unofficial rebuttals believe that the customs agreement has no evidence of violating international obligations.</p>
<p>It is believed that Germany does not object to the study of this agreement by international law experts, but is unwilling to abandon it simply because France does not approve of it.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 29th: The British Industries and Agricultural Federation sent a letter to Foreign Secretary Henderson, requesting the government to actively find ways to prevent the implementation of the German-Austrian customs agreement, as it is greatly detrimental to British interests.</p>

<p>Tokonami Faction Suppressed</p>
<p>Internal Strife Inevitable</p>
<p>Telegraphic Communication, Tokyo, 30th: The new executives of the Seiyukai party after the re-election reveal the sorrow of President Inukai, who lacks monetary power, and the intensity of the internal strife between the Suzuki and Tokonami factions. The result is the defeat of the Tokonami faction. Initially, President Inukai, aware of the complaints from the non-executive faction about the past executives' tendency to act unilaterally, planned to promote Kugahara, who is fair, neutral, and unrelated to both factions, as the chief secretary and Yamazaki as the secretary-general. However, the Suzuki faction, fearing the decline of its power, urged Inukai to adopt the principle of a grand secretary-general, promoting Kugahara as the secretary-general, not establishing a chief secretary, and adopting a general affairs meeting system to handle party affairs. In fact, it wanted to make Mori Kaku the center of general affairs and expand its control within the party with Kugahara. Inukai was moved by this and changed his initial policy, adopting the Suzuki faction's proposal. Thus, the Suzuki faction was able to use the neutral Kugahara to maintain its power, and the Tokonami faction of the anti-executive faction was ultimately suppressed as non-executives. In the future, deep internal strife within the party is inevitable.</p>

<h3 id="e63">Commemoration Week of the Central Government and National Government <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Central Party Headquarters: The Central Party Headquarters held Premier's Commemoration Week at 9:00 AM on the 30th. Central Committee members Chiang Kai-shek, Shao Yuanchong, Ma Chaojun, Yu Jingtang, Chen Lifu, and others, as well as party officials and guests, totaling over 800 people, attended. After Chiang Kai-shek, the chairman, led the ceremony, he made the following report: "Yesterday, I attended the memorial ceremony for the revolutionary martyrs and felt a myriad of emotions. The March 29th Uprising can be said to be a great memorial for the promotion of revolutionary integrity. This revolutionary spirit demonstrates a complete dedication to the principles and the nation, without absolutely mixing in a trace of personal selfishness or prejudice. Therefore, it was able to sow the foundation for later success and leave behind a great influence. We, the survivors, should not only continue their legacy but also promote and develop their cause to fully realize the goals of the revolution. The entire history of the Party is created by the sacrifice and struggle of each party member, and the revolutionary history of each comrade must also be supported by the entire body. For example, Chen Jiongming, he participated in the March 29th Uprising. At that time, the general comrades were extremely hopeful of him, and even Premier gave him much leniency. Unexpectedly, since the seventh year of the Republic, Chen Jiongming's actions often contradicted the Premier's, clearly aiming to achieve his selfish and self-interested goals. Not only did he not work hard for the revolution, but he also wanted to obstruct it. The Premier, in order to safeguard the overall revolutionary situation, wanted to restrain him and remove him from office several times, but the general comrades within the Party expressed opposition. Later, Chen Jiongming's rebellious actions became evident, openly commanding rebel soldiers to attack the Guanyinshan Presidential Palace, and the Premier narrowly escaped disaster. This clear rebellion is something that any person with blood would find infuriating, but there were still comrades who secretly discussed that the Premier should not have pushed Chen Jiongming too hard. This completely proves that the revolutionary comrades at that time did not clearly distinguish between public and private matters, only knowing personal feelings and disregarding the principles and the Party and the nation. If everyone could have clearly distinguished between public and private matters at that time and followed Comrade Zhu Zhixin's proposal early on, then the overall revolutionary situation would not have suffered a serious setback, preventing the Premier from witnessing the success of the revolution in his own lifetime. Moreover, Chen Jiongming had participated in the glorious March 29th Uprising. If the comrades had known earlier to love people with virtue and not to act with personal feelings and friendships, then Chen Jiongming would not have cut himself off from the Party. Chen Jiongming's later failure and disgrace were not necessarily due to the general comrades failing to preserve his past history for him. Revolution is a difficult and serious undertaking that cannot tolerate any setbacks. Therefore, we should completely emulate the spirit of the martyrs of Huanghuagang, being public-minded and forgetting private concerns, thinking about the interests of the overall situation and the seriousness of right and wrong. Otherwise, even with a very great leader like our Premier, the revolution will still inevitably suffer setbacks. A revolutionary party is not without emotions. The unity of our Party is especially based on the affectionate and sincere solidarity between comrades. However, the emotions that our Party speaks of should be completely based on the great cause of the revolution. We should first ask about the public interest and then about personal friendships. In short, revolution is an eternal struggle. The first is to recognize where the great cause lies, and the second is to constantly strive. We, in commemorating the martyrs of Huanghuagang, feel that the preservation of revolutionary history is not an easy task. We must strive diligently and relentlessly, not caring for our own safety, and comrades must especially be public-minded and selfless, completely责勉 each other with righteousness. Then, the revolutionary history of our Party will be promoted and developed day by day, and the goals of the revolution will be achieved. Also, our most important recent task is the National Assembly on May 5th. The Premier's dying testament was to hold a National Assembly and abolish the unequal treaties, two major events. The only important cases in the National Assembly are the abolition of unequal treaties and the provisional constitution for the period of political tutelage. These two matters are at the critical juncture of life and death for our Chinese nation. Our party members and the people of the whole country should pay close attention to these two points and quickly express their own opinions to contribute to the Party and the nation to determine the Party and the nation's long-term plan. Especially regarding the abolition of unequal treaties, we can recognize the true attitudes of various countries in this movement to abolish unequal treaties in the thirty-five days before the National Assembly. Which is our friend? Which country is our enemy? Which country is oppressing us? Which country is helping us? And we can determine this. We hope that the people of the whole country and all party comrades will pay extra attention to this point." The ceremony then concluded and the attendees dispersed.</p>

After Chairman Chiang Kai-shek led the ceremony, Shao Yuanchong gave a speech, stating that in the Premier's teachings, he saw that political reform had an important principle, namely, "everyone should be given their due talent." The Premier also had a detailed explanation of this. Even if everyone is educated and encouraged properly, using their talent appropriately, then politics can be managed and social undertakings can be developed. Regarding educating people properly, except for the disabled, if they can be cultivated properly, whether they are intelligent or foolish, they can all be used to serve the world. Under the current Party rule, all politics are based on the Three Principles of the People and the Premier's teachings, formulated into policies and guidelines, and handed over by the Party to the government to implement. The government implements the policies and guidelines set by the Party step by step, which can show the spirit of the Party. However, political reform must also be done in order of priority and urgency, completed in sequence according to human and financial resources. Therefore, in education, talents must also be cultivated according to needs. In the past, many students who returned from studying abroad could not express their talents due to various reasons, which was not economical. Now, the urgency of various undertakings in the country should be considered, and then various practical talents should be cultivated according to this principle. In the recent years, the following matters should be actively worked on: (1) Completing local autonomy as the basis for political tutelage. (2) Popularizing education and then cultivating various specialized talents. (3) Developing and improving agriculture to enrich the people's food supply. We must gather the human and financial resources of the whole country in the recent years to make significant achievements in the above three undertakings, and then carry out other undertakings as appropriate. The government uses extremely economical methods to use human and financial resources, and education also follows this guideline for cultivation. In this way, people can make full use of their talents, making the political foundation more stable, and cultural and construction undertakings will gradually develop. Then, by dividing labor and cooperating, everything can be completed. The full text of the speech is being organized.</p>

The meeting adjourned at 12:00 noon.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, at 2:00 PM, a joint meeting of the Party Committees of the five provinces and regions was held to discuss future work policies. At 4:00 PM, the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee held its first meeting to discuss internal organization and implementation plans, which lasted until 6:00 PM in the evening before adjourning. The appended speeches are as follows:</p>
<p>Wu Tiecheng's Speech: Respected comrades and guests, today</p>
<p>is the inauguration ceremony for the Party Affairs Steering Committee and</p>
<p>Special Commissioners of the four Northeast provinces and the Harbin Special Region. It is also the establishment of the Liaoning Provincial Party Headquarters. This ceremony is very grand, a bright and splendid page in the history of national salvation and nation-building. Although the Northeast Party Headquarters was established late today, the Northeast comrades and the Northeast people have participated in revolutionary practical work for twenty years and contributed a great deal to the revolutionary movement, promoting the current unified and peaceful situation. As for why the Northeast Party Headquarters was established only today, it was because of the Sino-Russian War the year before last and the Feng-Yan Rebellion last year. For three or four years, Northeast comrades defended the country against foreign aggression and promoted national unity and peace. It was purely a matter of timing that it was established today.</p>
<p>Tiecheng is very honored to represent the Central Committee and participate in this grand event. I would also like to take this opportunity to say a few words on behalf of the comrades of the Central Committee. The comrades of the Central Committee know that the Northeast comrades have a great force in the history and spirit of the revolution. The Northeast comrades and the Northeast people continue to work hard and sacrifice for the revolution. It is very important to review the past facts. Although there have been several gaps in the middle, efforts have always been consistent. After the establishment of the Northeast Party Headquarters, it is hoped that all comrades will embrace two directions: (1) Spirit, (2) Material. The most important thing is that because it was in the military period before, of course, in the destructive period, since the military period has reached the tutelage period, we should all go on the road to construction. When President Sun Yat-sen was dying, he repeatedly told us to "peacefully struggle to save China." Now that the obstacles have been removed, we must use peace to save China, use the spirit of peace to do construction work, and use the Three Principles of the People to promote China. Since 400 million Chinese compatriots know that the Three Principles of the People is the doctrine of national salvation, we should think of ways to make our compatriots thoroughly understand the greatness of the Three Principles of the People. The national character of the people of Northeast China is simple and honest. Northeast comrades work hard in propaganda, and we believe that the Three Principles of the People is the doctrine of saving China and building China. I believe that Northeast Party affairs will inevitably be more successful than other provinces. President Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People is the culmination of ancient and modern China and foreign countries. President Sun Yat-sen also said that the Chinese people are the way of the king. What is called the way of the king is to convince people with virtue, which is different from the way of hegemony, which is to convince people with force. President Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People relies purely on benevolence and righteousness. For example, Yao and Shun ruled the country and the world was public. In other words, they served the public. The Three Principles of the People is to call on the people to serve the society. Revolutionary comrades take serving the society as their duty. Our comrades have firmly believed in the Three Principles of the People. From then on, our actions should take the country as the premise, not the purpose of seizing. This is the starting point of the Three Principles of the People. We should work hard to promote it to the people of Northeast China. As for the seven basic movements of party members, they are afforestation, literacy, baojia, sanitation, national goods, roads, cooperation, etc. These seven tasks are to express the Three Principles of the People in both propaganda and political aspects. In other words, it is to be consistent in words and deeds. Furthermore, when it comes to the relationship between the Party Headquarters and the government, Tiecheng represents the Central Committee's comrades and says a few more words. In the past, many personnel of the Party Headquarters in various provinces, counties, and cities were found to be acting immaturely, causing the general public to lose their sympathy for the Party. However, the comrades who run the Party cannot be trained well in a short period of time. After the Kuomintang unified China, it did not prepare many talents for running the Party and distributed them to various places, because those who believe in the Party's doctrine and the talents for running the Party are absolutely two different things. In the past, many disputes occurred between the Party and the local government and the people because of this reason. It is hoped that the Northeast comrades should thoroughly realize and recognize the reasons for this kind of mistake. Speaking of the Party and the government are two systems, the Central Party Headquarters is supervising the National Government. Under the National Government is the provincial government, and the provincial government controls the county and municipal governments. The Party Headquarters in the provinces, cities, and counties can only supervise the local government's implementation of the central government's laws and regulations and report to the Central Committee whether they have violated any acts. The Central Committee notifies the National Government to correct the errors and cannot exercise supervisory tasks. On the one hand, it is only responsible for propaganda to the people, so that the people can understand the central government's policies. In the past, such unfortunate disputes as those that occurred in the Party Headquarters in various counties of Hebei Province should not be seen in the future. At the same time, the Party and the government should be united as one, so that the construction cause can be free from obstacles. I talked to Deputy Commander Zhang about running the Party two years ago. At that time, Deputy Commander Zhang had an ambition and said to me that if the Northeast runs the Party, it must be better than all other provinces and counties, so that the Party affairs in the Northeast can catch up later. At that time, I greatly admired Comrade Zhang Hanqing's understanding of the Party was very profound and persevering, and I believed that although the Northeast Party Headquarters was established later, it would inevitably catch up later after it was completed. The comrades of the Central Committee also made comments and all twelve points believed that the future achievements of the Northeast Party affairs would be able to catch up later. Today, Tiecheng participated in the inauguration ceremony of the Party Affairs Steering Committee of the four Northeast provinces and the Party Affairs Special Commissioner of Harbin, and I am very honored, and I wish the Party Affairs workers and the people of Northeast China to work together.</p>
<p>Zhang Ji's Speech: After Wu Tiecheng's speech, Zhang Ji gave a speech, saying briefly that today is the inauguration of the Party Steering Committee of the Northeast provinces and regions and the establishment ceremony of the Liaoning Provincial Party Headquarters. I am very honored to participate in this grand and solemn event. My ancestral home is Hebei. I have been to Liaoning six times. In the past revolutionary destructive period, the Central Plains was disturbed, but only the Northeast corner was able to maintain peace and stability, which made the people of Hebei envious. I have always paid close attention to the Northeast because You, Yan, Liao, and Jin are dependent on each other. Looking at the glorious history of the people of Northeast China in the past, they are now deeply insulted and oppressed by imperialists and are struggling and fighting every day. The reason why the imperialists are carrying out aggression is purely a national problem. It must be known that our nation is a mixture of Han, Manchu, Mongol, Hui, and Tibetan, and they are not separated from each other. Moreover, the national spirit of our country is strong, persevering, and hardworking, and it is crowned by all countries in the world with such an excellent and great nation. No matter what imperialists carry out oppression, the result will eventually be failure. To seek national rejuvenation, we must have self-confidence. The most fearful thing is to belittle ourselves and refuse to make progress. Today, the Liaoning Provincial Party Headquarters is established, I hope you will lead the people to take on the glorious history of our motherland and work together to strive to promote the great spirit of our nation.</p>
<p>Zhang Xueliang's Reply: After Zhang Ji's speech, the whole audience applauded. Zhang Xueliang then represented the entire Northeast Steering Committee and gave a reply, saying briefly that today the Party Affairs Steering Committee of the four Northeast provinces took office, and the Central Committee sent Committee Member Wu Tiecheng to grace us with his presence and administer the oath and guidance. All comrades are grateful and even more fearful of falling short. However, we will follow our conscience and act in accordance with President Sun Yat-sen's instructions and the central government's policies. Although we dare not be confident that we can do well, with the guidance of Committee Member Wu at any time, we can be more at ease. We hope that all comrades will not be polite and often come to give guidance so that the Northeast can fully develop President Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary spirit. This is our sincere hope. Present</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>there are many questions from the general public about the direction of national salvation.</p>
<p>What can I do? I said that there is no second way, only to realize the Three Principles of the People. In the past, many people said that the Kuomintang had all kinds of mistakes. This is a misunderstanding. It must be known that the mistakes of party members are personal actions and should not be attributed to the Party itself. I often say that theory should be studied by the Party, and practice should be struggled for. Our comrades can only take responsibility with a clear conscience and move forward. Thank you for your guidance today.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Northeast Reclamation Superintendent Goes Abroad to Inspect Land Reclamation Policies of Various Countries <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Publishes Account of Reclamation Efforts and Inspection Opinions Before Departure</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: Zou Zuohua, the Superintendent of Land Reclamation in the Xing'an Region of Northeast China, has spared no effort in handling land reclamation affairs in recent years and has now achieved excellent results. Recently, in view of the need to learn from Europe and the United States in land reclamation, he requested and was approved by Zhang Xueliang, Commander of the Northeast Border Defense, to travel to European and American countries to inspect land reclamation policies. The planned trip is for one year, with monthly travel expenses of 10,000 yuan. Only Secretary Xu Kechang and Liu Mingjiu will accompany him. All matters related to the Land Reclamation Superintendent will be the responsibility of Chief Executive Gao Renfu. The following is a record of Mr. Zou's conversation at the time of his departure: "Since the Northeast Army entered the customs in the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, at that time, the reorganization was implemented. I was the Artillery Commander and requested to bring a part of the army to the border to try out land reclamation, on the one hand, to develop national resources and enrich border defense and security, and on the other hand, to promote agricultural and industrial undertakings, adjust the domestic surplus population, and eliminate the unemployed demobilized army for productive undertakings. At the same time, I also want to help Mongolian compatriots develop their various undertakings. However, I was originally a soldier and have little knowledge of politics and scholarship. Moreover, there is no precedent for land reclamation in China, and even the current central government has no overall plan for land reclamation. Therefore, for the past two years, I have been constantly working hard on land reclamation, but I still feel that the strategies are insufficient. Therefore, I have long planned to have the opportunity to go abroad to inspect once as a reference for future land reclamation. Furthermore, the funding for land reclamation is now extremely difficult. Various large-scale constructions such as road construction and mining cannot be carried out according to plan. If this continues, the future of land reclamation will be in unimaginable danger. If it unfortunately fails, it will not be important to me personally, but I am afraid that it will affect the future of land reclamation in China. At the same time, the Chinese people will also regard land reclamation as a daunting task. As a result, all national resources, border defense security, and a number of unemployed people in the country will be in a dangerous situation. Therefore, the relationship is really great, so today is a time of great urgency. We must strive to find a way out. This time, I went abroad to persuade overseas Chinese capitalists to invest in the Xing'an area to help the development of land reclamation. I have had this idea for a long time. In the past, because land reclamation was in its initial stage, everything was not yet in place, so I did not dare to let go and go abroad immediately. Now, various land reclamation facilities have taken shape. There should be no delay during the short period of time I am away. I began to ask Commander Zhang to fulfill my long-cherished wish for foreign inspection. After going abroad, all the affairs of the Land Reclamation Office have been entrusted to a competent person to act as an agent, and it can be carried out according to the fixed plan. All my itinerary dates and inspection steps have not yet been determined, so I cannot publish them for the time being. I will wait until I return to the country to make all the process and gains public to the whole country as a reference for my land reclamation and as a blueprint for all future land reclamation undertakings in China. Finally, the conclusion is that this time I went abroad for land reclamation and did not stop land reclamation because of going abroad." (26th)</p>
<h3 id="e66">National Government Representative Gao Lingbai Arrives in Guangzhou <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Carries Medals to Award to Various Generals</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Recently, in order to reward the generals of the Eighth Route Army in Guangdong Province, the National Government has specially issued a large number of Precious Tripod Medals to be distributed in Guangdong. Those who have been awarded include Chen Ce and Chen Qingyun of the Navy, and Jiang Guangnai, Yu Hanmou, Cai Tingkai, Li Yangjing, Xiang Hanping, Dai Ji, and Yang Dingzhong of the Army. The Precious Tripod Medals were carried south by Gao Lingbai, Secretary of the Civil Service Department of the National Government. Mr. Gao arrived in the province on the 24th, and the medals above the rank of division commander that he carried were immediately handed over to Chairman Chen of the Provincial Government for transfer to Civil Service Chief Gu Wenguan for awarding on a regular basis. It is heard that the authorities plan to hold an award ceremony at the Provincial Party Headquarters in the province in the near future, when Gu Wenguan, the Civil Service Chief in Guangdong, will represent the National Government to award the medals. Yesterday, the authorities also received a telegram from the Civil Service Department of the National Government stating, "Chairman Chen Zhenru, Commander-in-Chief Chen Bonan, and Commander Chen Choushuo's medal reviews were received. The Chairman has instructed that the medals for the Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government and the generals in Guangdong will be awarded by Civil Service Chief Gu in modern times. I have also sent the medals by Secretary Gao Lingbai for compliance. National Government Civil Service Department respectfully printed." It is heard that in addition to awarding medals to Chairman Chen and the division commanders, the Precious Tripod Medals brought by Mr. Gao this time include the Third Class Precious Tripod Medals for other brigade commanders such as Huang Renhuan, Zhang Ruigui, Li Zhenqiu, Ye Zhao, Zhang Meixin, Zhang Da, Huang Zhiwen, and Huang Yanzhen, and the Fourth Class Precious Tripod Medals for each brigade commander. The Precious Tripod Medals for each brigade commander are currently being sent by the National Government and are not being carried by Mr. Gao at the same time. After Mr. Gao arrived in Guangdong, it was said that he had two tasks in Guangdong this time. One was to carry the Precious Tripod Medals so that Civil Service Chief Gu could represent the National Government to award them to the generals. The other was to come south on the orders of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to urge Civil Service Chief Gu to return to Beijing to serve as soon as possible and to inquire about Commander-in-Chief Chen Jitang's recent illness. I have visited Mr. Chen and Mr. Gu these days. Mr. Chen's malaria has healed and his spirit has recovered. However, Civil Service Chief Gu's back tumor has not healed. The tumor occurred on the back and affected the nervous system, causing pain in the limbs and making it difficult to walk. According to Civil Service Chief Gu's intention, he still needs to stay in Guangdong for treatment in the near future and will return to Beijing after the wound is healed. (March 26th)</p>
<h3 id="e67">Sichuan Becomes Southwest Opium Center <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Yunnan, Guizhou, and Gansu Opium Are All Shipped Out from Here</p>
<p>Yichang Is the Number One Export Market</p>
<p>Chongqing Correspondence: The length of time opium has been planted in Sichuan is well-known both at home and abroad. The name of Sichuan opium has spread far and wide. Farmers rely on it for their livelihoods and to cope with high taxes and levies. Armies rely on it for their maintenance and expansion. According to a recent survey, the counties with the most opium cultivation are Fengdu, Fuling, Liangshan, Dianjiang, Kaixian, Suiding, Youyang, and Xiushan in eastern Sichuan; Pingshan, Leibo, Mabian, Xichang, and Yazhou in southern Sichuan; Songpan, Lifan, Maoxian, Guanxian, and Qionglai in western Sichuan; and Tongjiang, Nanjiang, Bazhong, Nanbu, and Xichong in northern Sichuan. These are all well-known special product areas. The provinces that import into Sichuan are Yunnan and Guizhou. Yunnan opium is imported through Xufu, Guizhou opium is imported through Qijiang and Fuling, and Gansu opium is imported through Bikou. Chengdu and Xikang opium are imported into Chengdu through Yazhou. A small portion of the opium produced locally in Sichuan and imported from other provinces is consumed in Sichuan, and the majority is still transshipped and exported to other provinces. Yichang is the number one export market for Sichuan opium. A relatively small number of opium is exported from Suiding and Chengkou to Xiangyang, Fancheng, and Laokou in Hubei. The Yangtze River coast and Henan, Hebei, Shandong and other provinces are all sales markets for Sichuan opium. Therefore, the number of people engaged in investing in the opium trade is increasing day by day, and it occupies a strong position in the entire Sichuan business community. The special industry chambers of commerce in Yichang, Chongqing, Wanxian and other places can be used to</p>
<p>see the integrity of its organization. Recently, even brokers have organized a special industry neutral merchants' association, which is enough to prove the general situation of opium production and sales in Sichuan.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Soviet Russia Traffics Grain from Northern Manchuria <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Direct Loading and Export from Fujin</p>
<p>The Conspiracy of the Soviet-Russian Grain and Stone Company</p>
<p>Undermining the Economy and Commerce of Northern Manchuria</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: The Binjiang Chamber of Commerce heard on the 23rd that Soviet Russia was buying miscellaneous grains and soybean oil in Fujin, downstream of the Songhua River, and shipping them out of the country, so it telegraphed the Fujin County Chamber of Commerce to inquire about the truth. That evening, it received a reply from Fujin stating that the Russian purchase of oil and grain was in accordance with the provincial order to levy a 5% duty on top of various taxes for export. The Binjiang Chamber of Commerce considered the telegram to be too brief, so it invited the Harbin Chamber of Commerce, oil mills, flour mills, grain merchants, grocery stores, and other groups to hold a joint meeting at the Binjiang City Chamber of Commerce to discuss the government's approach. As a result, it was decided to first telegraph the provincial government to inquire about the details of the matter and then deliberate after receiving a reply. In addition, the entire navigation industry also held a meeting at the Navigation Bureau to discuss the matter and decided to follow the attitude of each group. It is heard that the reason why the Russian purchase of oil and grain is directly exported is that the Russian government established a grain and stone purchasing company in Harbin in February this year with a capital of 2 million gold rubles to specialize in buying soybean and grain for sale to Europe and the United States to make profits. The reason why the special products of Northern Manchuria cannot be exported is not that the fundamental market price is higher than that of Europe and the United States, nor that the special product merchants of Europe and the United States are unwilling to buy them. The reason is that the freight of the East Railway is too high and the grain price plus the freight does not meet the market price of Europe and the United States. Russian merchants buy at low prices and ship directly from Fujin to Russia by ship or travel overland through the Ussuri Road to Siberia and enter Europe, or ship by sea from Vladivostok to the United States to earn multiple profits. Because of the purchase of grain, they can also take the opportunity to drive ships into our inland rivers to share the navigation rights of the Songhua River and import Russian goods through the river, which is a multiple benefit. This move was contacted by the Russian Consul stationed in Harbin with the Jilin Provincial Authorities. The Jilin Authorities did not carefully examine it and hastily allowed Fujin to be a rich area of special products in Northern Manchuria. The economy and commerce of grain and stone have always relied on Harbin for transshipment and export. Russia's interception and purchase there has cut off the source of goods and products from Harbin and Northern Manchuria.</p>
<p>It is quite destructive to the production and commercial system of Harbin, so it is extremely worthy of attention. (24th)</p>
<h3 id="e69">Gao Ying's Appeal Case Judgement <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Original Judgment Revoked, Innocent of Opium Portion</p>
<p>Official Misconduct Portion Sentenced to One Year and Four Months</p>
<p>Sun Yuan Sentenced to Two Years for Opium Portion</p>
<p>After the Supreme Court sent Gao Ying's case of assisting in opium trafficking and official misconduct back for retrial, the Jiangsu Higher Court held a hearing on the 26th and announced the end of the debate. Today is the date of the verdict. At 2:15 PM, Chief Justice Lin Dawen of the Criminal Division One ascended the Fourth Tribunal (because the First Tribunal was holding an examination and watchman) and brought Gao Ying and Sun Yuan to the court to inquire about their age and place of origin, and then read the main text of the verdict as follows: "The original judgment on Gao Ying and Sun Yuan is revoked. Gao Ying is sentenced to one year and four months of imprisonment for soliciting bribes in the course of his duties, and fined 1,400 yuan. The number of days of custody before the determination of the judgment shall be converted into one day for every two days of imprisonment. If the fine is converted into imprisonment, it shall be calculated at three yuan per day, but the term of imprisonment shall not exceed one year. He is innocent of the opium portion. Sun Yuan is sentenced to two years of imprisonment for assisting in the sale of opium, and fined 2,000 yuan. The number of days of custody before the determination of the judgment shall be converted into one day for every two days of imprisonment. If the fine is converted into imprisonment, it shall be calculated at three yuan per day, but the term of imprisonment shall not exceed one year." After the judgment was pronounced, Sun Yuan declared an appeal. Gao Ying also expressed an appeal and said that the purpose of the appeal was not to fight for civil rights, but because he was not willing to submit to the facts. In addition, Gao's wife, Liao Suqiu, has been seriously ill recently, but it may not be easy to arrange for medical treatment outside of bail.</p>

<p>Feng Ruliang, manager of the Liangzhe Salt Affairs Inspection Office, was ordered by the Ministry of Finance to concurrently serve as the Director of the Anti-Smuggling Bureau. Yesterday, he met with Feng Yuwen, the former Director of Anti-Smuggling, to discuss the handover once. It is heard that Mr. Feng is scheduled to take over on April 1.</p>
<p>The Liangzhe Salt Tax has been ordered by the Ministry of Finance that, in addition to light-taxed salt, a tax silver of three corners per dan should be increased immediately. Yesterday, the Inspection Office has telegraphed the Ning, Wen, and Tai salt tax bureaus to follow suit and implement the increase in collection on the first of next month.</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Telephone Bureau is now organizing a renovation engineering team to depart to renovate the Hangzhou-Ningbo and Hangzhou-Quzhou lines. (1) The Hangzhou-Ningbo line has a total of 3,878 poles erected from Mengjia to Ningbo Fenghua (the entire section of wiring was replaced and renovated once when the telephone line was added from Wuyun to Ningbo last year). It is installed along the automobile road and will be renovated in about a month. (2) The Hangzhou-Quzhou line has many mountains along the way from Hangzhou to Lanxi, with 4,007 poles. Although it has been renovated once after the heavy snow last winter, it is feared that it will not last long. It has now been decided to start renovating and replacing the plant poles. The cost is huge, and it is planned to renovate six kilometers every day. The entire line is 358 kilometers long and it is heard that it will take two months to complete. (30th)</p>

Although the Guanqian Street, etc. in the county have been widened to 14 meters, automobiles and carriages have not yet been driven and pedestrians are very crowded. In the past, in order to show consideration for the merchants, there was a temporary suspension of the change directive. However, the urban population is increasing day by day, which is indeed a general trend in modern times. All streets should be widened from time to time according to the needs of the situation, and there is no reason to permanently retain the original width. It is difficult to approve what you have requested. You must still respectfully comply with the repeated orders and report back for verification and acquisition."</p>

<p>Arrest of Suspects in the Kaiyuan Township Robbery Case: It has been learned that the Su Shunji Trough Workshop in Heliekou, Kaiyuan Township, Fourth District, was robbed by more than ten bandits at midnight on the 20th of this month, resulting in a loss of 600 yuan. It is now known that Liu Chunlan, the chief of the Ninth Branch of the Public Security Bureau in charge of the area, led police officers on a patrol yesterday morning around 9:00 am. They saw a person looking flustered near the Mao toilet behind Su Shunji. The person hid in the toilet, pretending to relieve themselves. Director Liu of the branch suspected the person's behavior and immediately arrested him, bringing him back to the bureau for interrogation. The person confessed his name as Zhou Jingchun, residing in Fengxiang. He stated, "I know about the Su Shunji robbery case. I carried three pistols during the robbery, which are now hidden somewhere. I also cut the telephone lines to prevent reporting." After receiving the confession, Director Liu immediately prepared a document and submitted it to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<p>Rampant Meningitis in the Urban Area: Since the beginning of spring in this area, the weather has been erratic, with sudden cold and hot spells. As a result, infectious diseases are rampant in the city, such as diphtheria and colds, with many sufferers. Meningitis is especially rampant, and its onset is extremely rapid, with little chance of recovery if treatment is delayed. For example, a Zhang woman, aged 17, residing in the workers' quarters of the Jiatai Silk Factory outside the East Gate, suddenly contracted the disease and died at 2:00 pm yesterday. At the same time, a Cai boy named Meigen, aged 9, residing in Wang Daoren Lane, also contracted the disease, and his condition is quite dangerous.

<p>The Truth About the Case of the Wife Killed with a Pitchfork: Huang Rongchu, a villager from Cheng Tang near Yanqiao Town, Tianshang City, Fifth District, killed his wife, Shen Qinxian, with a pitchfork a few days ago. The murderer was caught on the spot and sent to the Public Security Branch for transfer to the County Court for interrogation and detention. It is now known that the reason for Huang Rongchu's murder of his wife was jealousy. The deceased, Shen Qinxian, had an affair with Gao Ziqing, who used to be a car manager at the Taichang Silk Factory outside the South Gate. Gao's wife, Shen, learned about this and informed Huang Rongchu, Qinxian's husband. Huang was furious upon hearing this, leading to the tragic event of killing his wife with a pitchfork. After learning about this, Gao Ziqing was also furious because his wife's jealousy had caused this great disaster. He took a kitchen knife the morning before yesterday and slashed at his wife, Shen, twice, but both missed. Neighbors snatched the kitchen knife away. However, Gao was still not satisfied and took a ladle, hitting Shen on the back of the head, causing blood to flow and Shen to collapse unconscious on the ground. Neighbors sent Shen to the hospital in the city for treatment and notified Shen's family to come and arrest Gao, sending him to the Eighth Branch of the Public Security Bureau. Director Zhou opened the court for preliminary interrogation and sent the case to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation yesterday.</p>
<p>Careless Electrical Fault at Yu Lun Silk Factory: The Yu Lun Silk Factory outside the South Gate of this area, north of Tieshu Bridge, was originally scheduled to start production on April 2nd.

Unexpectedly, at around 1:00 am yesterday, an electrical fault occurred in the warehouse, and flames soared, making it impossible to approach. The fire brigades from various sections rushed to the scene and worked hard to put out the fire, but the goods stored in the warehouse were completely burned to ashes. Fortunately, the factory had fire insurance and has already telegraphed the Shanghai Insurance Company yesterday, requesting them to send personnel to Wuxi for inspection in order to receive compensation.</p>

<p>Fujian Salt</p>
<p>Monthly Allocation of 120,000 for Education Expenses</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance previously approved the Fujian Provincial Government's request to allocate 140,000 yuan per month for education expenses after the salt surtax revenue was centralized. However, the current tax rate for Fujian salt is only 2 yuan per dan for the regular tax and 3 yuan for the surtax, which is disproportionate compared to other salt-producing areas. Furthermore, the expenses of 106,000 yuan per month for the administrative, inspection, and anti-smuggling agencies of the salt industry, as well as other temporary expenses, are all paid from the regular tax and are not the responsibility of the local government. Therefore, in June of the 17th year, the Fujian Finance Reorganization Committee decided that the salt affairs expenses were insufficient. The regulation attached to the outlines and measures for the distribution of the military quota, military expenses quota, and military-political expenses of Fujian included a provision to allocate 30,000 yuan per month from the salt surtax to supplement the salt affairs expenses. In October of last year, the ministry submitted a proposal to the Executive Yuan, which was decided at the 89th meeting. When the monthly revenue from the Fujian salt surtax is within 120,000 yuan, it should be fully allocated to education expenses. If it exceeds 120,000 yuan, subsidies may be provided according to the proposal. The provincial government of Fujian and the Ministry of Education have been notified accordingly. As for the seasonal fluctuations in salt tax revenue, it is inherently uncertain. After the centralization of salt surtax from various provinces, it is necessary to reorganize and reduce or exempt taxes. In the future, there will inevitably be changes, so it is impossible to use the current peak revenue as a standard. All education expenses to be allocated under the Fujian salt surtax should be based on the original proposal of the Executive Yuan's 89th resolution, with a fixed amount of 120,000 yuan per month, which is the fairest. The national treasury should allocate and issue 120,000 yuan per month after the revenue is recovered. The Ministry of Education has instructed the Fujian Department to inform them of this situation.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Ministry of Education's Instructions on Interpretation of Civil Servants <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education received a report from the Shaanxi Education Department stating that Zhang Buying, the magistrate of Zhongbu County, requested an interpretation of whether principals, teachers, and staff of primary and secondary schools below the senior primary level, as well as staff of educational institutions, are civil servants. The Ministry of Education instructed: It is understood that the term "civil servants" in the current Regulations for the Screening and Examination of Incumbent Civil Servants does not include principals and teachers of all levels of schools. However, the director of the county education bureau is an appointed official according to Article 17 of the County Organization Law and should be subject to screening and examination. The grade is determined by the education department of each province. If the actual salary of the director of the county education bureau is lower than the salary payable for the original grade, an explanation may be added when filling out the screening and examination form, and the grade in the official system does not need to be changed based on the actual salary. Other positions such as supervisors, clerks, and general affairs personnel who are clearly defined as appointed officials in the organizational regulations of the county education bureau should also be subject to screening and examination in accordance with the regulations. However, these organizational regulations are limited to those approved by the provincial government or the provincial education department. You should be informed and instructed accordingly.</p>

<p>Wu Nanxuan, the newly appointed president of National Tsinghua University, passed through Zhenjiang yesterday to visit relatives in Yangzhou. A reporter met him at the Zhenjiang Railway Station that evening and obtained the following glimpse:</p>
<p>(Question) Could you tell us about your appointment as the president of Tsinghua? (Answer) After returning to China, I was teaching at the Central Political School, and the responsibility was heavy. I wanted to give up my duties and voluntarily return to my alma mater, Fudan (graduated from Fudan and studied abroad), or other schools, just to teach from books and avoid a lot of trouble. Unexpectedly, a month ago, there was a proposal to appoint me as the president of Henan University. Before I could decline, I received the order to go to Tsinghua. I usually have no thoughts about Tsinghua in my mind, and Beijing was not the place where I wanted to teach. I insisted on declining, but I had to take on the responsibility temporarily. It was truly beyond my expectations. (Question) What do you think of the achievements of the former president, Luo? (Answer) Mr. Luo is decisive, has魄力 (a blend of drive and ambition), has ideas, and has knowledge. In recent years, there has been a lot of new construction in the school. (Question) Is it true that student representatives of the school have had a conversation with you, as reported in the Beijing Daily? (Answer) Their intention was nothing more than to inquire about the future school administration. I am naturally clumsy and only show sincerity to anyone I talk to. The opinions I expressed to the student representatives are the same as those I want to express to the central government: (1) I cannot have concrete proposals before I arrive at the school. (2) The foreseeable goals are to proceed with the original plan approved by President Chiang to rectify the school spirit and develop Tsinghua. (3) I hope that the school will develop evenly in the future. (4) I hope that students will not only seek progress in the intellectual aspect but also strive for all-round development in the moral aspect. (5) This trip puts personal interests aside and is based on openness and sincerity. I am naturally不喜欢 (dislike) using智巧 (cleverness and strategy), and I will not use智巧.智巧 (cleverness and strategy) sometimes ends, but sincerity can gain people's understanding. If the students' opinions do not go beyond the scope of what the school should prosper and reform, they should be adopted automatically. As for how to implement them concretely, there must be a standard after arriving in Beijing. (Question) What is the school's financial situation? (Answer) The regular expenses are more than 1 million, and the temporary expenses are also close to 1 million, totaling about 3 million. The source is the American Boxer Indemnity. However, the Boxer Indemnity has a completion time, so a certain amount of millions is allocated from the regular expenses each year as a fund. The principal and interest cannot be used. Currently, there are more than 9 million, and this fund can be increased in the future. This fund was formerly managed jointly by the government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Americans, but it is now managed by the Cultural Fund Management Office. (Question) When will you go to Beijing? (Answer) It has not been decided yet. At this point, the car had entered the station, so we hurriedly said goodbye.</p>

<p>Establishment of the Education Fee Consolidation Movement Committee</p>
<p>Due to financial problems, the schools in Chongming went on strike for a week. After the provincial education department ordered the county to allocate funds, they unanimously resumed work on the 27th. At 10:00 am on the 29th, hundreds of representatives from various schools in the county held a meeting at the branch of the urban district primary school. Huang Jianxin presided over the meeting. Cai Xiecai, the representative to the provincial education department, reported on the progress. The inspectors from various districts reported on whether there were any violations of discipline during the strike period and passed a declaration of resumption of work. In the afternoon, the meeting continued to discuss various fundamental solutions: 1. Organize the Education Fee Consolidation Movement Committee, and nominate Zhou Jiahui, Shi Xihuang, Lu Zhenfeng, and four others as members. 2. Suggest that the Education Bureau quickly organize an Economic Audit Committee in accordance with the law. 3. Suggest that the Education Bureau immediately establish an Education Fee Clearance Committee so that Chongming's education fees can be properly rectified in the future, avoiding the situation of cutting flesh to mend sores. However, Zhang Peishu, the acting director, has not yet returned to Chongming due to a lack of public trust.</p>

<p>The Education Department Strictly Orders Investigation</p>
<p>Recently, a small number of students at Zhejiang Provincial Ninth Middle School caused a strike due to impulsive actions. It is reported that the reason was that Wang Minggao, a student in the middle school department of the school, repeatedly skipped classes and went out without permission. The school affairs meeting decided that the student had received two special warnings before and should be expelled according to the regulations. The principal executed the decision. Then the student instigated his classmates to make unreasonable demands, and a group of students held the school gate, posted slogans indiscriminately, and prohibited teachers and staff from entering and leaving. At that time, the principal, Zhang Minghao, happened to be applying to the Education Department for a leave of absence due to an outbreak of acute meningitis near the school. The Education Department ordered the principal to return to school immediately and supervise all teachers and staff to be responsible for earnestly rectifying the situation, and instructed all students to attend classes immediately to focus on their studies and not to engage in any more violations of the rules. Yesterday, another telegram was sent to the school, stating that students must not interfere with school affairs. If there are still undesirable elements who are willing to be incited, the ringleaders should be identified immediately and expelled from the school to serve as a warning to others. Harmful elements must be eliminated without leniency to avoid misleading young people. The magistrate of Jiande County was ordered to assist in the handling.</p>

<p>The Draft of the Municipal Education Administration's General Outline of a Speech</p>
<p>Xu Peihuang, director of the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, gave a speech at the Qingnianhui at the invitation of the Municipal Research Association, outlining the general situation of education in Shanghai. The general situation has been published in various newspapers, but there were slight errors in the transcript (editor's note: the transcript was issued by the Xinsheng Society), which did not correspond to the original meaning of the speech. Yesterday, Xu specially spoke to reporters to correct this, saying that the speech at the time actually stated that all countries in the world have a certain direction for education. This direction must not only be suitable for the shortcomings of the country's society but also adapt to the world's trends of thought. Otherwise, even if the material civilization of the world progresses, it will be of little benefit to mankind. The educational policy of our country is based on Dr. Sun Yat-Sen's legacy, which shows that after restoring all the inherent national essence of our country, we must learn from the strengths of Europe and the United States. The educational policy of the Three Principles of the People is the only way to build education that is shifted from material construction to psychological construction to achieve social construction. This certain and unchangeable educational purpose is enough to change the past state of randomness and build a consistent spirit for the future. The implementation of the Three Principles of the People is urgently needed by our country's environment as the only good medicine to save our country from poverty and weakness, and those who promote its power and promote its spirit must devote themselves to the construction of Three Principles of the People education. Therefore, the education of the Three Principles of the People is the center of our efforts, and there is no other way out. Furthermore, the greatness of the education of the Three Principles of the People, its ultimate goal is not only to save our country but also to save the world and achieve world harmony.</p>
<p>In addition, there were omissions and errors in the number of schools mentioned in the speech. For example, there are actually 597 unregistered primary schools in this city, but the draft was mistakenly published as 59. The full text of the speech will be published later after it is sorted out by the Municipal Research Association and myself.</p>

<p>The Purpose is to Create Inventions</p>
<p>And Exchange International Lectures</p>
<p>National Jinan University, in view of the fact that university education is not only to impart advanced knowledge but also to cultivate talents who can create or invent academically, has been expanding its income over the years and still adheres to the old scores of the 17th year. Recently, under the policy of tightening up expenses, it has spared no effort in academic awards. In addition to the science museum experiment in the College of Science, research laboratories have been added to all colleges, each of which is subsidized by the school for 300 yuan per month specifically for research expenses. An academic evaluation committee has also been set up to specialize in awarding students for specialized research in academic works. With regard to basic tools, such as those whose Chinese and English grades are slightly inferior, special training classes have been set up, and President Zheng has hired Qiu Zhongfan, Hong Jili, and Yu Jizou to prepare for the establishment of the school. The school is also contacting famous professors from European and American universities to come to the school to give lectures. It is said that the school will exchange archaeology and literature and philosophy professors.</p>

<h3 id="e108">Discussion on the Closing Account Period for the Money Trade <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Colleagues in various ports responded enthusiastically</p>
<p>The Money Trade Association, for the sake of the Municipal Social Bureau's proposal that the annual accounting period for national industry and commerce be fixed starting from the 20th year of the Republic (1931) with the first period ending at the end of June, the second at the end of October, and the third at the end of February of the following year, held a meeting to discuss it. The members all said that there were various obstacles to the third closing account period ending at the end of February, and considered the end of January to be the most appropriate. They also sent letters to various ports seeking their agreement (the original text and the progress of the letter were recorded in various newspapers). Now, various ports have sent letters in succession unanimously agreeing and expressing their willingness to support the effort to achieve the original goal in order to benefit commerce. The letters from the Money Trade Associations of various ports are recorded below. (1) Letter from the Nanjing Municipal Money Trade Association: In reply, on March 15, we received your association's letter and the draft letter to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce regarding determining the annual accounting period for national industry and commerce in accordance with the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau's proposal to use the end of February as the final closing account period. After your association meeting resolved that there were various obstacles to the final closing account period ending at the end of February and determined that the end of January was the most appropriate date, we were honored to receive your inquiry. After our association held a meeting to discuss it, the members all agreed that your association's proposal was very appropriate. After investigation, the end of January is the end of an agricultural solar term, which is still convenient for summarizing accounts, and there are no conflicts with various customs. Everyone unanimously agreed to comply and implement it. This special letter is to inform your association and we hope you will take note of it. This is addressed to the Shanghai Money Trade Association. (2) Letter from the Wuhu County Money Trade Association: Respectfully, we received your letter regarding the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau's proposal to change the annual accounting period for national industry and commerce starting from the 20th year of the Republic (1931) to have the first closing account and submission period at the end of June, the second at the end of October, and the third final closing account period at the end of February of the following year, which was inquired by the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce to see if various industries agreed. Your association believes that it is difficult to implement the final closing account period at the end of February and proposes that the end of January be the final closing account period. This consideration is thorough, suitable for commercial conditions, and highly admirable. In addition to the telegram (original text attached below), the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce unanimously agreed. Please take note of it. (The rest is omitted.) Attached is a copy of the telegram: (Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Respected Sirs: After investigating the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau's proposal to use the end of February as the final closing account period, there are indeed various obstacles in commerce. Your association's inquiry of various industries' opinions is also insightful. Your city's Money Trade Association's proposal to use the end of January as the final closing account period is suitable for commercial conditions and our association highly agrees with it. Shanghai holds the commercial hub of the Yangtze River. This change in the closing account period was also proposed by your city's Social Bureau. Please accommodate the opinion of the money trade and vigorously advocate for it. The money trade is fortunate, and all industries are fortunate.

<h3 id="e109">Shanghai County Farmers' Association Established Yesterday <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Elected Executive Director and Executive Committee Members</p>
<p>The preparations for the Shanghai County Farmers' Association have been going on for a long time. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the founding meeting was held in the auditorium of the County Reorganization Committee. Attendees included He Qingmei and Gu Yunru from the Second District, Jin Lemao and Huang Xueshang from the Third District, Wang Xiangmei and Ye Junde from the Fourth District, Zhu Daquan and Zhu Bochun from the Fifth District, Jiang Yanchou, instructor of the County Reorganization Committee, and Zhu Shifang, representative of the County Government. Zhu Daquan was publicly elected as the chairman, Huang Xueshang as the recorder. After the ceremony was conducted in accordance with regulations, the chairman first reported that the establishment of the Farmers' Association had been organized in four districts in the county. According to Article 13 of the County Farmers' Association's organizational regulations, it was possible to establish the County Farmers' Association. Thus, Comrade Gu Yunru and others initiated the preparations, which have now been organized and established. Next, the instructor of the County Reorganization Committee delivered an encouraging speech, saying that the establishment of the association today represented the spiritual hope of all farmers in Shanghai County. In the past, the farmers of Shanghai County, because they had no organization, had nowhere to express their grievances and nowhere to voice their opinions. However, these two problems would be solved in the future. However, he also hoped that everyone would pay attention to the following two points: (1) Farmers account for more than 90 percent of the county's population, but only a small number of them are members of the association. It is hoped that the association will work hard to recruit new members so that all farmers in the county are members of the association, and then the association's power will be more substantial. (2) In accordance with the Central Farmers' Association Law, various undertakings must be earnestly led, and farmers throughout the county must jointly study and work hard to implement them in order to develop the rural economy and consolidate the foundation of the country. Next, the county government representative delivered a speech (omitted). Then, elections were held, and as a result, Gu Yunru was elected as the Executive Director, Jin Lemao as the Deputy Executive Director, and Huang Xueshi, Zhu Daquan, Wang Xiangmei, Zhu Bochun, He Qingmei, and others as Executive Committee Members, and Ye Junde and Jin Linrong as Alternate Executive Committee Members. Gu Yunru, the representative attending the Provincial Farmers' Association, was elected. After the election, two temporary proposals were made: (1) How to receive various documents and accounts from the former County Farmers' Reorganization Committee. It was resolved that the Executive Committee would handle it. (2) To stipulate the association's regular expenses. It was resolved that the Executive Committee would prepare a budget and submit it to the competent authorities for allocation. After the meeting, the first meeting of the Executive Committee was held, and it did not end until around 6:00 PM.</p>

<h3 id="e111">The Japanese Ship Xinqing Maru Suffers Repeated Misfortune <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>After Hitting a Reef, It Is Robbed Again</p>
<p>The sixth Xinqing Maru of the Japanese Osaka Shosen Kaisha, after its accident in the South China Sea, was robbed again. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Ship Hits Reef: There are many hidden reefs in the South China Sea between Xiamen and Guangzhou. Last month, the Japanese ship Nasu Maru encountered fog and hit a reef there, and was subsequently robbed by pirates. This time, the sixth Xinqing Maru of the Osaka Shosen Kaisha, with a displacement of 3,400 tons, also encountered fog and accidentally hit a reef in the same area on the 24th of this month. The hull was broken and seawater entered the ship. Yesterday, it was learned that the entire ship was about to sink and there was no hope of towing it.</p>
<p>Hull Cracks: The No. 6 Xinqing Maru's first hold was first pierced by the reef, and the second hold was also caught on the reef. After water entered both holds, the hull sank, and the third hold also cracked, with seawater filling the cargo hold. Finally, the fourth hold could not support it either, and cracks appeared. All three holds were submerged in the sea, with only the stern still above the water. By yesterday afternoon, it was heard that the water had flooded the deck, almost submerging the entire ship.</p>
<p>Pirates Loot: After the accident, all the workers on the ship, totaling over a hundred, were rushing to the deck to try to launch the lifeboats to escape, when suddenly more than ten pirate-driven sailing ships, each carrying between twenty and thirty pirates, surrounded the Japanese ship in an attempt to loot it. At this time, the crew and sailors could not escape, so they obtained the prepared firearms from the captain's cabin and engaged in a fierce battle with the pirates, exchanging gunfire. Many sailors were wounded or killed.</p>
<p>Japanese Warship Rescues: After the accident, the captain first sent a radio message for help. After receiving the report, its Moji branch dispatched the rescue ship Yuusho, carrying 28 workers and technicians, to rescue the crew and inspect the towing situation. At the same time, the Japanese warship stationed in Magong also received the telegram and, after hearing that hundreds of pirates were besieging and attempting to loot the ship, two Magong warships rushed to the scene of the accident to protect the ship and rescue the distressed crew. Subsequently, it was heard that the Japanese warships had arrived at the South China Sea on the 29th. The pirates fled when the warships arrived. The crew was trying to rescue the ship, but the number of deaths and missing persons was still unknown. The entire ship's cargo and the ship itself had already completely sunk into the sea.</p>

<p>At the memorial service of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company yesterday, engineer Zhang Yao reported that after inspecting the Xinchang at Sijiao Mountain, which had already sunk into the sea, the hull was cracked and could not be salvaged. The original plan had to be abandoned. The procedures for engaging a Japanese salvage company had also been terminated.</p>
<h3 id="e113">The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiang Yu Steamer Workers All Go on Strike <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Unable to Sail This Morning</p>
<p>The Jiang Yu steamer of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, which departed from Shanghai for Hankou yesterday, saw its entire crew suddenly cease work in the afternoon, initiating a strike that resulted in the obstruction of cargo loading. The details of this matter have been investigated and reported as follows:</p>
<p>Transfer of Boatswain Triggers Strike</p>
<p>The Jiang Yu steamer, after returning to Shanghai from the Transportation Department, was scheduled to resume its Yangtze River route and depart this morning. The Navigation Department of the company issued an order yesterday promoting the boatswain of the steamer to a wharf position in another port, with a corresponding increase in salary. Unexpectedly, this decision sparked labor unrest and led to the strike.</p>
<p>Universal Opposition from Workers</p>
<p>Upon receiving this order, all the crew members on board the ship unanimously opposed it. The sailors, stokers, stewards, tallymen, and workers from the midship section collectively resolved to demand that the company rescind the order. They elected representatives to appeal to the responsible department, requesting the exemption of the boatswain from the transfer. However, the company, believing that yielding to the workers on the transfer of a single boatswain would set a difficult precedent, refused their request. Consequently, the entire crew declared a strike at 4:00 PM, ceasing all work.</p>
<p>Complete Disruption of Goods</p>
<p>Yesterday, a large quantity of goods was to be loaded onto the Jiang Yu steamer, and they were continuously transported to the Jinliyuan Wharf before 4:00 PM in preparation for loading. However, the sudden strike disrupted everything, leaving the wharf piled high with goods that could not be loaded onto the ship. Passengers who learned of the situation rushed to the company to inquire. The company, upon receiving the news, immediately dispatched personnel from the Navigation and Business Departments to persuade the workers to return to work.</p>
<p>Public Association Mediation Ineffective</p>
<p>After the incident, the workers reported it to the Shanghai branch of the Seamen's Union. Based on the report, the union immediately sent a letter to the head office, urging the company to quickly withdraw the order to transfer the boatswain, otherwise the strike might escalate. They requested an immediate response. The situation was tense, and as of 6:00 PM, there was still no resolution. By 8:00 PM that night, there was still no news of the Jiang Yu steamer departing, indicating that the issue had not yet been resolved.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Maritime Insurance Established for Seamen <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai Chinese Merchant Shipping Companies have organized a maritime insurance company to provide financial assistance for the employees of merchant ships and to handle the aftermath of accidents. The initial organizers disbanded, but now eight shipping companies, including Sanbei, China Merchants, Ning Shao, etc., have jointly invested in the creation of a new one. They are actively drafting articles of association and raising capital. Last year, the seamen of various Chinese and foreign ships requested a pay raise starting in September. It was immediately agreed that each person would receive an increase of six yuan per month, with four yuan added from September and another two yuan in March of this year. Now that the second phase of the pay raise has arrived, the Shipping Guild has consulted with various shipping companies and obtained approval to add another two yuan per month to the workers' salaries. However, this additional salary will be reserved for maritime insurance premiums. The guild will invite representatives from the Seamen's Union to obtain the consent of the seamen to deduct these two yuan from each bureau's salary each month and send it to a designated agency of the Shipping Guild for safekeeping. Once the insurance company is established, insurance policies will be issued to each household. Yesterday, all the shipping companies were notified to deduct this amount from now on.</p>

<h3 id="e117">International Labor Conference to Be Held Again <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Selection of Representatives</p>
<p>The 15th International Labor Conference will be held in Geneva, Switzerland, on May 28th of this year. China only started participating after the establishment of the National Government. The employer representative is nominated by the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce from among domestic industrialists. Last year, Wu Qintai was invited to attend the 14th conference as the employer representative, with Sun Zunxian as his advisor. The government sent Ma Chaojun as its representative. The 15th conference is about to be held, and a reporter from the Guowen News Agency visited the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce to inquire about the matter. The relevant documents are compiled as follows:</p>
<p>Order from the Ministry of Industry: Regarding the matter of compliance, the 15th International Labor Conference is scheduled to be held in Geneva, Switzerland, on May 28th of this year. The Ministry has drafted a proposal on the method of sending representatives and advisors to attend this conference and submitted it to the 14th State Council Meeting of the Executive Yuan for discussion. It was decided to send it to the Central Political Conference. Now, the Executive Yuan Order No. 1205 opens with: "Regarding the handling of the matter, the letter from the Civil Service Office of the National Government No. 1903 opens with: 'Regarding the matter of the letter from the Central Political Conference approving the Executive Yuan's letter transmitting Minister Kong Xiangxi's proposal to formulate measures and budget for sending representatives to the 15th International Labor Conference for review, etc., the 264th meeting of this conference resolved to pass the measures and the budget to the Finance Group for review. In addition to sending the budget after the decision, the case is recorded and the original proposal is enclosed for reference and handling.' In accordance with the Chairman's instructions to the Executive Yuan, etc., in addition to replying to the letter, a copy of the original document is sent for your reference." According to this, the measures in the resolution regarding the dispatch of employer representatives and advisors should be jointly proposed by the China Industrial Association Federation and the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China and submitted to the government for approval. As the conference is approaching, the candidates for these representatives and advisors must be determined urgently. In addition to the separate orders, the Ministry encloses its proposal and orders the association to jointly determine the candidates with the China Industrial Association Federation and report them to the Ministry for submission to the government for approval.</p>
<p>Minister Kong's Proposal: The measures proposed by Minister Kong at the State Council meeting are as follows: Regarding the proposal, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a letter from the International Labor Office regarding the notice of the 15th International Labor Conference, requesting review, etc. After checking the Ministry, the meeting is scheduled to be held in Geneva, Switzerland, on May 28th of this year. The seven issues to be discussed are mostly important, especially the election of the members of the Board of Directors, which is a key three-year re-election. China has expressed its hope to obtain a seat on the Board of Directors in previous conferences. At this time, it is necessary to strive for election in order to achieve the initial goal. As the opening date is approaching, the measures for sending representatives should be prepared in advance to facilitate the process. The measures for sending representatives are as follows: (1) Sending Representatives: (A) Government representatives are proposed to be nominated by the Ministry as in the past and submitted for approval. The first representative will be selected and sent from the country, and the other will be selected from among the foreign envoys. (B) Employer representatives were previously nominated by the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce. This year, the China Industrial Association Federation has been established. The proposals of this conference are related to both industry and commerce. Regarding the selection of employer representatives, it is proposed that the two associations jointly nominate one representative and submit it to the government for approval. (C) Labor representatives are proposed to be nominated by the Central Party Headquarters in consultation with the labor community and submitted by the government for approval as in previous years. (2) Selection of Advisors and Secretaries: (A) Government advisors and secretaries. The proposals of this conference are mostly important, and experts should be selected for consultation. Regarding the discussion of the age of children in non-industrial work and the revision of the Convention on Night Work for Women, in accordance with the letter from the International Labor Office and the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles, one woman must be selected as an advisor. This time, it is proposed to send three advisors (one of whom is a woman) and one secretary, who will be selected by the Ministry from those who are familiar with international labor affairs, and submitted for approval. (B) Employer advisors are proposed to be jointly nominated by the China Industrial Association Federation and the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce and submitted to the government. (C) Labor advisors are proposed to be nominated by the Central Party Headquarters and then submitted by the government for approval. (3) The government plans to send a total of people this time. The expenditure for the delegation is expected to be higher as one additional woman is assigned as an advisor than in the previous years. Furthermore, the price of gold has doubled this year compared to last year; the expense for attending this conference has to be increased accordingly. Regarding the issues to be discussed at this conference, the Ministry is currently formulating counter-proposals based on investigations and references to domestic conditions, and is studying competitive strategies for the election of members of the Board of Directors for the attending representatives to carry out. Is it appropriate to prepare the measures for sending representatives to the 15th International Labor Conference? Please review and decide the expenditure for the attending representatives.</p>
<p>Letter to the Industrial Federation: The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce sent a letter to the China Industrial Association Federation yesterday, stating: We are writing to inform you that we have received the Order No. 220 from the Ministry of Industry (omitted in the middle), etc. In accordance with this, we are writing to inform your association for verification. Please reply to us regarding how to handle this case.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Reactions to the Shanghai Municipal Council's Estimated Rent Collection <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Statement from the Real Estate Association: Li Bohan, the standing committee member of the Real Estate Association, told a reporter from the Guowen News Agency yesterday that the collection of housing taxes in the Public Concession has always been calculated according to the actual rent and based on the house bill. This is a common principle in municipal administration in various countries. This time, the Shanghai Municipal Council organized a rent valuation committee and invited our association to nominate a Chinese representative to serve as a member of the committee. The legislative intent is to focus on the self-owned residences of property owners who do not have house bills to indicate the amount of rent. When there is a dispute between the taxation department and the property owner, the member will be responsible for arbitration. However, our association absolutely insists on the decades-long practice of basing the rent on the house bill and will not allow any changes. If the Shanghai Municipal Council calculates the rent based on estimated rent, the harms will be immeasurable. Because the estimated rent has no legal basis, the tenants will suffer from the pain of arbitrarily increasing the tax rate. The Shanghai Municipal Council will have unlimited ways to extract money, which will cause disputes and resentment in the future, and will run counter to the purpose of hoping for the prosperity of the municipal administration in the Concession. This kind of plan only seeks financial revenue and disregards the burden on the citizens, which is unfair and should be immediately cancelled. Our association will soon send a serious protest to the Shanghai Municipal Council, with the main text in Chinese and an English translation attached.</p>
<p>Public Letter from Zhongshe: Shanghai Zhongshe sent a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Shanghai International Settlement yesterday, stating: We are writing to inform you that our company's houses are rented from Huazhong Company, with a lease agreement stating that the monthly rent is 350 taels from 144 Weihaiwei Road to 156, with the Huazhong lease and receipts as proof. The Shanghai Municipal Council should calculate the general municipal tax according to the actual amount of rent. Unexpectedly, they have estimated it to be 520 taels without authorization. Although our company submitted the lease agreement, rent receipts, and a certificate from Huazhong stating the reason for calculating our company's rent, requesting the Shanghai Municipal Council to correct it, they replied that they did not explain the reasons for the valuation and did not express any opinion on the evidence submitted by our company, only stating that the Shanghai Municipal Council has the right to estimate the price, and rejected our company's reasonable request without considering it. Our company's houses belong to the Jing'an Villa range leased by Huazhong. The city houses along Jing'an Temple Road each occupy ten squares of land, with a construction cost of over 1,000 taels per square and a land price of over 50,000 taels per acre. Our company occupies a total of 30 squares of land, with a construction cost of less than 900 taels per square and a land price of less than 30,000 taels per acre, because the original plan was to build a garage, which was later changed to a club by our company's agreement with Huazhong Company. The buildings are far inferior to the city houses along Jing'an Temple Road in Jing'an Villa, but the rent of the city houses is only 130 taels per house, which is better than our company's monthly rent of 350 taels in terms of the ratio of investment benefits. Calculating the general municipal tax at 350 taels is not incorrect (omitted in the middle). We are especially sending the drafts of the letters we have sent to the Shanghai Municipal Council and various evidence to your association for your assistance in fighting for our rights. In addition to sending a separate letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council stating that we have applied to your association for negotiation, we will send the general municipal tax of 14% of the actual rent of 350 taels, totaling 147 taels, directly to the Shanghai Municipal Council. If the Shanghai Municipal Council refuses to accept it, the responsibility for the delay should be borne by the Shanghai Municipal Council. Please state this together.</p>

<h3 id="e126">Weng Tonglu, Destitute and Homeless, Commits Suicide by Poisoning in a Hotel <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>A Suicide Note to Three Cousins</p>
<p>"Family Members Need Not Grieve"</p>
<p>Weng Tonglu, a 28-year-old man from Ningbo, was formerly in the foreign goods business. Recently, due to unemployment, he had been idle for a long time, drifting in Shanghai with nothing to do. His parents, wife, and children were all in his hometown. Now, due to the economic pressure he felt, he suddenly became suicidal. On the evening of the 28th, at 8:00 PM, he went to the Siming Hotel (newly opened) at No. 96, next to Yuqing Lane, at the intersection of Xizilaihuo Street and Damalu in the French Concession. He checked in under the changed name of Shi Erqing into a small room on the third floor, No. 38, and paid one yuan for the room. After the waiter brought in tea, Weng closed the door and wrote a suicide note. After writing it, he swallowed poison and committed suicide. After taking the poison, he went to sleep. The next day at noon, the waiter, Dong Awu, saw that Weng had not yet gotten up, and the time had passed the hotel's regulations, so he knocked on the door to ask if the room was needed. Weng replied, "I'll sleep a little longer." At 3:00 PM, he knocked on the door again, but there was no response. Knowing that something was wrong, he informed the accountant and notified someone from the Hotel Industry Association to come and force open the door. They found that Weng had died. His body was still warm. They found a suicide note and reported it to the police station, which sent detectives to investigate. They took the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall for an autopsy. The suicide note was addressed to his cousins, Weng Tongkang, Tongzi, and Tongchuan. He recounted the economic pressure and difficulties in life that led to his suicide. He asked them to take care of the aftermath and comfort his parents and wife, telling them not to grieve. Finally, he instructed them to cremate his body. The address on the letter was No. 59, Shuangguili, Kangti Road, Father Du Road. The detectives went to the address and found Weng Tongkang, a relative of the deceased, who identified the body. Yesterday, the Criminal Section of the French Police Station reported to the French Court. The judge, upon inspecting the scene, confirmed that the deceased had committed suicide by taking poison and ordered photographs to be taken. He approved Weng Tongkang's request to prepare a coffin and collect the body. Tongkang has now urged the deceased's parents and wife to come to Shanghai to collect the body.</p>

<p>Does Not Affect the Scenery of the Park</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reports that the extraordinary development of the central district of the Public Concession in recent years has rendered the sewage disposal plant built on the Bund of Beijing Road ten years ago inadequate, necessitating the construction of a new plant. The construction work currently underway inside the fence in the Bund Public Garden is the building of this new plant. According to the report, the original plant on the Bund of Beijing Road was equipped with two pumping stations that transported sewage collected from the ditches east of Henan Road across the Waibaidu Bridge to the sewage plant in the eastern district. The new plant being built in the park will be equipped with the latest inventions. Two larger pumping stations will be temporarily installed, and another pumping station may be added in the future. The pumping station is 20 feet deep and entirely underground. Once completed, the exterior will be no different and will not affect the scenery of the park. The underground room of the original plant on the Bund of Beijing Road will be demolished and the pumping station will be replaced with a steel curtain to separate hard materials in the pipes.</p>

<h3 id="e129">Mental Breakdown Leads to Suicide by Jumping from Building <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Wang Afu, a 40-year-old man from Anhui, had been renting a room at the Mingli Inn (a small hotel) on Guizhi Road in Wusong for a long time. He had no occupation and suffered from occasional mental illness. The day before yesterday, after dinner, Wang left the Mingli Inn. Later, he went to the home of his friend, a Mr. Wu, at No. 15 Nanchang Road. Wu invited him to chat on the bed upstairs. At that time, his expression showed no strangeness. At about 10:00 PM, Wang and his friend were chatting and laughing happily on the bed when someone knocked on the door downstairs urgently. Wu was about to go downstairs to open the door when Wang, hearing the knocking, seemed startled and suddenly had a relapse of his mental illness. His attitude changed drastically, and he jumped from the bed and out of the window. Wu was shocked to see this and rushed to save him, but it was too late. He fell from the window and landed in the courtyard on a water tank. His friend immediately went downstairs to inspect and saw that the water tank was broken and Wang was lying in a pool of blood with his head resting on the broken tank, severely injured and barely breathing. His friend and neighbors immediately carried the injured man to the Seashore Public Hospital on Wai Malu. The hospital refused to accept him because his internal organs were damaged and it was difficult to treat him. The injured man was carried back to the Mingli Inn and died there yesterday morning. Afterwards, because Wang had no family members in Song, his body was purchased with donations from his friend and the owner of the Mingli Inn. A coffin was purchased, and he was buried at the Zhenbei Cemetery in the afternoon. They are trying to find Wang's family members to come to Song to claim the body.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Zhang Tiankai Acquitted of Gun Charge <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Tiankai, owner of the Tiankai Xiang Bulb Factory on Edouard Avenue and a native of Fengjing, was deceived by the slander of his accountant, Chang Huinan, and severely reprimanded Ma Haiwen, a Xiang native who was the doorkeeper, for not driving away passers-by who urinated in the lane next to the factory. Ma did not admit his negligence and responded with harsh words, which angered Zhang, who opened fire and fired two shots that missed. Ma sued him to the police station and was taken to the Special District Local Court, which prosecuted him for obstructing freedom. The official ordered the defendant to pay 5,000 yuan as bail pending trial. The details have been reported previously. Yesterday morning, witnesses Cai Heshang, Zhang Dabao, Shen Yushu, Li Xingfa, etc. were summoned to testify and said that Ma Wenhai had actually started the fight by hitting Chang Huinan first. When Zhang arrived at the factory, Ma grabbed an iron bar and rushed towards Zhang, uttering abusive words and threatening to beat him. Zhang then held a pistol and ordered him to throw away the iron bar. Because Ma did not listen, Zhang fired two shots at the ground. The defendant continued to be defended by lawyers Jiang Yiping and Zheng Wenkai, who argued that the defendant fired the gun purely in self-defense. After the debate with the police lawyer ended, Judge Ge carefully examined the case and declared that the police's prosecution of the case under Article 319 of the Criminal Law for obstructing freedom was inappropriate. Therefore, the case could not be established and Zhang Tiankai was immediately declared not guilty. He was still required to pay the original bail during the appeal period.</p>

<p>Yesterday at about 3:15 PM, a heavy vehicle was passing over the Lihong Bridge in Hongkou. When the vehicle went off the bridge, its momentum was very strong. Unfortunately, the laborer pulling the rope in front of the vehicle slipped on the mud and fell, causing the wheel to crush his abdomen and injure vital parts. He died on the spot. Several companions, seeing the cause of the disaster, feared being implicated and quickly pulled the car away without a trace. Street guards No. 1549 saw this and chased after the driver of the car that caused the accident, but were unsuccessful. They could only send the body to the Tongren Hospital and then to the Coroner's office for an autopsy. The deceased was wearing a short black cloth shirt, blue cloth trousers, had a shaved head, and was barefoot. He was approximately 30 years old.</p>

<p>Cai Zhenting Submitted to the Public Security Bureau</p>
<p>Jiang Caisheng, an employee of the Dahua Socks Factory, was walking outside Xiaobeimen around 4 p.m. the other day when he was suddenly knocked down from behind by a passing car, injuring his face, nose, and upper and lower front teeth. The injury was quite serious. At the time, the car sped away. The police officer on duty was unable to catch up, only vaguely remembering the car's concession license number as 9226. He then took the injured person to the First Precinct of the Second District. After investigation, Xu, the station chief, determined that Jiang Caisheng's injury was severe and ordered him to seek treatment at a hospital. However, Jiang Caisheng was poor and had no funds, so he went to Renji Hospital. The doctor found that his injury was quite serious and had not yet healed. The First Precinct of the Second District sent a letter to the Public Works Bureau to investigate. It was found that the car involved in the accident belonged to the Yinghai Automobile Company in Xiaonanmen. The driver, Cai Zhenting, was summoned for questioning as to why he sped away after causing the accident. Cai denied the charge. The officer on duty provided evidence, and it was determined that the driver, Cai Zhenting, should be submitted to the Public Security Bureau for severe punishment to serve as a warning for the future.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Unidentified Male Corpse Found South of Xinlonghua <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>A nameless male corpse, estimated to be around 60 years old, was discovered on the 24th of this month in the riverbank east of the Shi family residence, south of Xinlonghua in West Shanghai. The local bailiff, Pan Caisheng, reported it to the court. The court appointed Prosecutor Wu Deying to go to the countryside with a coroner to inspect the corpse. The inspection revealed that the corpse had drowned itself before death. The coroner ordered that photos be taken and the corpse be handed over to the local bailiff to prepare a coffin, collect the body, and temporarily place it in a temple to await identification. Unexpectedly, a man went to the Third Precinct of the Sixth District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau the day before yesterday, claiming that his name was Wei Guanquan, 41 years old, from Shenzhuang Town, Nanhui County. His father, named A Xu, 61 years old, took 46 silver dollars on the first train to Changqiao Town on the 21st of this month to buy a cow. Before leaving, he said that he would return in three days. Until the 16th, he had not returned home. The family was extremely anxious. He had no choice but to go out to search. He went to Xia Yusheng's house in Xiajia Village, Changqiao Town, to inquire. According to Xia Yusheng, his father had come once near evening on the 21st and again on the morning of the 23rd. Later, because there was no cow to buy, he went back. According to Xia Abing's mother, his father came a second time (i.e., on the 23rd) and went to the town with Xia Yusheng to smoke, etc. He asked Xia Yusheng where his father went after smoking with him. Xia firmly claimed that he did not know and did not go to town to smoke with him. He then went to Gujia Village's dairy shed to inquire about his father's whereabouts and whether Xia Yusheng had been there. According to a village woman, a few days ago, Xia Yusheng and an unfamiliar old man did come to Gu Xiaolong's house to buy a cow, but they did not succeed. In the evening, they went back together. He was extremely anxious. Later, he heard that an unidentified male corpse was found in the riverbank east of the Shi family residence north of Changqiao Town on the 24th of this month. According to villagers, the age and appearance of the corpse were similar to his father. He immediately went to the court to investigate and saw a photo of the corpse. It was indeed his father. However, according to the coroner, there were no injuries, and there were only dozens of copper coins on his body, nothing else. The silver dollars he had brought and the black cotton robe and gray long shirt he had on were all missing. The cause of his father's death was unknown. Xia Yusheng was highly suspected. He pleaded to detain him and seek justice for him, weeping uncontrollably as he spoke. After receiving the report, Chief Liu immediately dispatched a senior police officer to arrest Xia Yusheng overnight. Xia confessed that he was 43 years old and lived in Xiajia Village, Changqiao Town. He admitted that he went to buy a cow with the deceased, but he did not know how he died. Chief Liu considered the case to be a serious one involving murder for money and immediately prepared a document yesterday afternoon, sending the corpse, the son of the deceased Wei Guanquan, and the suspect Xia Yusheng to the bureau to await investigation and verification.</p>

<p>At around 6 a.m. yesterday morning, at the Shanghai South Railway Station of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, the station was preparing to depart the second early express train to Hangzhou. A passenger carrying a wooden stool arrived at the station to buy a ticket. The passenger lingered near the ticket window and looked suspicious. Tan Xianchao and Chen Jiaqi, the station police, stepped forward to question him. The passenger was evasive in his answers. They took the passenger and the wooden stool to the station master's office together. Station Master Zhou opened the stool and found miscellaneous items in the drawer, but the stool was inlaid with thin boards all around and weighed more than usual. He pried open the wooden boards and found a large amount of opium in the compartment. The opium was taken out and weighed, totaling 84 taels. The police took the person and the contraband to the South Station Police Department for questioning. The person confessed that his name was Zhao Honglu from Taizhou. Today, he met an unfamiliar man on Daxin Street, Simailu, who gave him this wooden stool and asked him to carry it to the South Station to take the train for two jiao. The man did not come with him. He did not know that there was opium stored in the stool. Chief Zhuang of the police department believed that the suspect was not telling the truth and was extremely cunning and an old drug dealer.

<p>The Security Team Supplied the Guns</p>
<p>The Kidnapping Cost 1,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Secret Meetings Held in the Park Each Time</p>
<p>Qu Songjia, the manager of the China Bank branch outside Xiaodongmen in the Nanshi district of this city, was kidnapped by bandits at around 8 a.m. on the 16th of this month when he was taking his private chartered car to the bank to work. At the time, due to the request of his family, the newspapers did not disclose the information. It is now heard that Mr. Qu has escaped and returned home yesterday. The details of the entire incident are supplemented below.</p>
<p>Branch Manager Rides in Chartered Car Mr. Qu is 34 years old, a local resident, and the second son of Qu Changshun, who runs a fish shop in Xiaodongmen. He is currently the manager of the Nanshi China Bank branch. His home is located at No. 3 Shenghao Lane, Dong Yaojia Lane, under the jurisdiction of the Second Precinct of the First District in Nanshi. Mr. Qu is young and strong, but he is quite frugal and only has one chartered car for transportation. On the 16th of this month, Mr. Qu got up in the morning, washed, and finished his meal. He took the chartered car to go to the bank to work. The driver, Jiang Hongqing (from Tongzhou, 33 years old, introduced by Tang Afu, a driver from the Ding family in Qiaojiabang, on the ninth day of the ninth lunar month last year), had just dropped off Qu's son at school and returned home. The car was parked at the entrance of the lane, waiting for the master's order.</p>
<p>Interference with Urination Leads to Kidnapping At 8:15 a.m., Qu came downstairs and got into the car. The driver was just pulling up the car's shaft, but before he could start, he saw a person wearing a dark-colored silk long gown walking into the lane, looking like he was going to urinate. Qu saw this and shouted that the place was not for urination. Unexpectedly, this person ran to the front of the car, first grabbing the driver's chest and twisting his clothes, then pulling out a pistol and shouting for the car to stop. At the same time, two people ran in from the entrance of the lane and dragged Qu out of the chartered car, telling him not to make a sound. The two men grabbed Qu's arms and pushed him out of the lane into a car that was parked on the side of the road, and sped away. The chartered car driver quickly returned home to inform Qu's older brother. They then went out to inspect the lane, but the people and the car had disappeared without a trace. Qu's family immediately reported the situation to the Second Precinct of the First District, requesting an arrest.</p>
<p>A Letter Suddenly Appears Earlier, the Dalu Automobile Company on Zhaopulu suddenly received a young man in a Western-style suit, about 20 years old, at 6:50 a.m. that morning. He rented a car to be sent to Fook Kai Sum Road in the French Concession, agreeing to a rental fee of $1.50. The young man took out two dollars, and the cashier gave him back 50 cents. He then ordered the driver, Zhuo Shiliang (from Ningbo, 32 years old), to drive car number 17688 in the concession, municipal number 511, to the destination. When the car arrived at the corner of Fook Kai Sum Road and Route Doumer, the young man ordered the driver to stop the car. He took out a letter from his pocket and ordered the driver to deliver it to a nearby dairy stand. The driver refused. While they were arguing, two people suddenly jumped out from the side of the road.</p>
<p>Borrowing a Car to Carry Out the Kidnapping After the two jumped out, each produced a pistol and forced the driver out of the car, forbidding him from making a sound. They then dragged him to a pine forest nearby and sat him on the ground. The young man in the Western-style suit drove the car away himself. The two men watched the driver for about an hour, then used hemp rope to tie the driver's hands and feet behind his back. The two then fled together. The driver struggled for a long time to remove the ropes and immediately ran to report to the detective head in the Route Tenant police station. The detective head immediately telephoned the Public Security Bureau and various police stations in the Public Concession to pay attention to intercepting the car. At the same time, the Second Precinct of the First District learned of this news and realized that the car used to kidnap Qu was rented by the bandits from the Dalu Automobile Company.</p>
<p>Mistakenly Reported Car Number When the French police dispatched telegrams to various police stations, they mistakenly reported the car number 511 as 571. After the Public Security Bureau's Supervisory Office received the report, it immediately sent Detective Captain Lu Ying and his team, including team leader Qi Haitain and detectives Zhou Peisan, Zhang Xinglong, and Han Ruisheng, to the Public Works Bureau to inspect the car registration books. They found that car number 571 belonged to the Ruan Ji Automobile Company at 581 Zhonghua Road, Dadongmen. They immediately went to the company and impounded car number 571. The company made various explanations. Captain Lu telegraphed the Second Precinct of the First District again and learned of the mistake. He then took car number 571 to the Dalu Automobile Company on Zhaopulu to inquire about the truth.</p>
<p>A False Alarm At that time, various police stations in the Public Concession also learned of the kidnapping case in the Chinese area. The reported car number was also mistakenly reported as municipal number 571. Therefore, additional Chinese and foreign detectives were stationed at various checkpoints to pay attention to interception. At that time, Captain Lu and others were driving car number 571 to the Baidu Bridge. The detectives there saw the car number arrive and saw five or six burly men sitting in the car. They believed it was the bandits' car. Everyone raised their guns and impounded the car. After repeated explanations, the misunderstanding was cleared up. However, the tense situation at the time caused the detectives to experience a false alarm.</p>
<p>Ransom Demanded 500,000 Yuan After Qu was kidnapped, his family received five letters from the bandits demanding a ransom of 500,000 yuan. Police Commissioner Chen of the Municipal Public Security Bureau immediately ordered his subordinates to solve the case within a limited time. As a result, detectives were dispatched from various districts. It was then discovered that a kidnapper named Peng Yaozhi (also known as Tang Mobang) was hiding in the 16th pier area. This was discovered by Xu Tao, a police officer from the Sixth District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. He reported it to the First Precinct headquarters, which dispatched police officers and detectives, including team leader Dong Mingde and detectives Yuan Haishan, Yu Maolong, Lu Anpu, Ren Shouzheng, and Xu Yulin, to investigate for many days. They were able to arrest the bandit. During the preliminary interrogation, Peng confessed that he was 26 years old and from Qidong. He came to Shanghai from Zhenjiang in November of last year and lodged at the Nankang Inn in the 16th pier area. He was introduced to Gu Huichang by his friend Xiao Yuan.</p>
<p>Mastermind Gu Huichang Peng further confessed that Gu had persuaded him to join his gang to do a big deal. He claimed that the capital would be provided by someone and the guns would be supplied by Chen Xiaobing (also known as Lianchu, nicknamed Chen Dwarf), the head of the Chuansha Security Team, who lived near Qingning Temple in Pudong. He heard and declined the offer, but later introduced two friends to them to join the gang and do the deal. The original team of detectives were then ordered to go to Chuansha County in Pudong to arrest Chen Xiaobing. Chen did open a butcher shop and a water shop there, but he had already fled after hearing the news. He then returned to Shanghai and was arrested in the Gu Family Hall at the Hai Chao Temple in Xiaonanmen, along with the mastermind Gu Huichang and Gu's mistress, Ms. Shen.</p>
<p>Secret Meetings in the French Park After detectives from the First Precinct arrested the mastermind Gu Huichang (nicknamed Long Legs, 34 years old, a local resident) and his mistress, Ms. Shen (39 years old, a local resident), they interrogated them in detail. Gu confessed that he had colluded with Xiao Yang, Zhang Erlang, and three others to take three pistols and kidnap Qu. Initially, they hid him in Wei Family Flower Garden in Longhua for four days. On the fourth night, they used a small boat to send the hostage to the countryside of Chuansha. They stayed there for two days. Because the situation in Shanghai was urgent, they hid him at Tang Family Residence, about twelve miles southeast of Chuansha. The money for this kidnapping was provided by his cousin, Gu Zhong'an, totaling 1,000 yuan. The three pistols were supplied by Chen Xiaobing (also known as Chen Lianchu, nicknamed Dwarf), a member of the Chuansha Security Team. Secret meetings were held in the French Park each time.</p>
<p>Bandit's Mistress Reveals the Location After detectives received the confession, they immediately took Gu and more than ten police officers across the river overnight and ordered Gu to lead the way to make the arrest. However, Gu was cunning and kept dragging the detectives around all night, never revealing the true location of the hostage. The detectives were exhausted and returned. The second time, they went across the river with the suspect again, but found nothing. Finally, the bandit's mistress, Ms. Shen, revealed the location. Yesterday, they went directly to the Tang Family Residence to rescue the hostage. However, the hostage had been sent back to Shanghai by the bandits the night before last (the 28th). Only two women, Ms. Tang Zhang and Zhang Erlang, the hostage guard, were arrested. Zhang confessed that he was 65 years old and from Chuansha. He only remembered that a guest was sent by his son-in-law, Chen Lianchu (i.e., Xiaobing), on March 23 of the lunar calendar. The night before last (the 28th), Chen ordered her husband, Tang Zhirong, and two others to send the guest back to Shanghai. She did not know anything else.</p>
<p>Hostage Confirmed to Be Safe When asked, Zhang Erlang, 28 years old, from Chongming, confessed that he was guarding the hostage and did not deny it. He also claimed that when the hostage was hidden in the Tang Family Residence, he and the other guards were blindfolded and could not recognize each other's faces. As for the reason for sending the hostage back, he heard that it was because the situation was urgent and could not be delayed any longer. When asked where the hostage was, he confessed that he did not know. Detectives went to Qu's house to inquire. According to his family, Qu himself had called a moment ago, saying that he was safe and staying at a friend's house and would not be returning home for the time being. He would go to another port to recuperate in a few days. However, the family did not know where he was. The detectives saw that the family was unwilling to reveal the location, but since he was already safe, there was no need to investigate further. They returned to report to the district chief.</p>
<p>Strict Arrest of Accomplices at Large After District Chief Chen of the First District learned that the hostage was safe, he sent the detailed confessions of the 1,000 case criminals to the General Bureau for verification. At the same time, he ordered his subordinates to pursue and arrest the accomplices at large and bring them to justice. However, the day before yesterday, the suspect Gu suddenly falsely claimed that the hostage was hidden in Gu's residence at No. 12 Route des Sœurs in the French Concession. Detectives from the First District, together with detectives from the French police, went to search, but found no trace of the hostage. It is heard that the residence is the home of the first mastermind, Gu Zhong'an. However, Gu had already fled after hearing the news.</p>
<h3 id="e145">An Unheard-of Record of Six Mutes Involved in a Lawsuit <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>For a Debt of Five Hundred Yuan</p>
<p>Six Mutes Formed a Group to the Fifth District</p>
<p>Unable to Speak, They Used Writing Instead</p>
<p>Monetary Civil Cases Were Not Accepted</p>
<p>Lin Jiemu Was Also One of the Six Mutes</p>
<p>Hearing Lawsuits and Judging Cases Involves Labor and Pain; Aides Yell Orders - How Can it Be? However, the scene at the Fifth District Public Security Bureau yesterday morning, involving a mute lawsuit, seems to be an exception. Aside from the judge, there were a total of six mutes in the court. The interrogation and answers were conducted using writing instead of speech - this was truly strange. Even more coincidentally, the mute lover Lin Jiemu from the movies was also involved, appearing at the Public Security Bureau's preliminary hearing office at the same time as his five mute comrades. The mutes were suing over money matters because one of them was a "untrustworthy mute" who intended to evade the debt. Therefore, they argued and wrestled with each other until they reached the bureau seeking a judgment. However, the result was that "the matter concerns a civil case, and this district is not suitable to accept it. You should file a lawsuit in court." The six mutes quietly and silently, disappointedly went outside. As for whether they can maintain their original silent attitude in the future and avoid going to court, it is impossible to say. For now, let us record what happened yesterday morning as follows:</p>
<p>A Mute Borrowed Money, Mute People Guaranteed - Hu Tonggang, a mute, borrowed three hundred yuan from Mr. Su last spring on behalf of a friend. At that time, two copies of the IOU were drawn up, stipulating the interest, and guaranteed by Qin Jiping, Xu Jiansheng, Guo Mingli, and Yu Yuanqing, four fellow mutes. This was also meant to "prevent relying on verbal agreement, leaving this as proof." Later, Hu Tonggang also borrowed two hundred yuan from Mr. Su for his own wedding expenses, drawing up another IOU and, to avoid troubling others, again asked the four mutes to act as guarantors. Thus, although these four people did not utter a sound, the responsibility for the five hundred yuan debt had been lightly placed on each of their shoulders. The two IOUs quickly expired, but Hu and his friend had no money. The creditor had no choice but to urge the guarantors Qin, Xu, Guo, and Yu to pay. The four mutes then turned to Hu, pressing him to pay, but day after day, there was still no money. As the saying goes, "It is not the fierceness that is feared, but poverty." The four mutes were implicated due to the guarantee and had no way out. It was truly a case of a mute eating Coptis chinensis - suffering without being able to speak of it. Finally, yesterday morning around eleven o'clock, they had no choice but to drag Hu Tonggang to the Fifth District Public Security Bureau, accusing him of evading the debt. Guo, a member of the district, interrogated him.</p>
<p>A Mute Interrogation Using Writing - Aside from Qin, Xu, Guo, Yu, and the debtor Hu Tonggang, the five mutes, why was Lin Jiemu among them? Lin had no connection to this matter. However, because Lin is currently an assistant to lawyer Huang and has some connection and friendship with the mutes, he also participated, becoming part of the lawsuit of six mutes who went to the Fifth District Public Security Bureau as a group. The fact that mutes are involved in lawsuits is not unseen, but for a pure mute group like Lin and the others to go to the Public Security Bureau to file a complaint is unprecedented. At the time, the mutes gesticulated and acted, but the result was equal to zero. This is because the officers of the Public Security Bureau are used to investigating cases and making judgments, but seeing this group of people who want to speak but cannot do so, they can only sigh helplessly. Perhaps the teachers of schools for the deaf and mute would have some methods that could be used. Finally, Guo, a member of the district, gave each mute paper and pen, ordering each to write their background and the facts of the complaint. The mutes then spread out the paper and wielded the brush, expressing their hidden feelings on the paper.</p>
<p>Silent as Crows, Peaceful and Calm - The guarantors Qin Jiping, Xu Jiansheng, and Guo Mingli all work in the photography department of the Commercial Press on Baoshan Road. The debtor Hu Tonggang is also a colleague. Each time Guo, a member of the district, asked a question, he also used paper and pen as a medium. Everything that was said was replaced with writing. However, when the meaning was concise and the details were brief, they also nodded and raised their arms to indicate yes or no. Therefore, although there were more than ten people in the court, it was very quiet and silent as crows. According to what was written, Hu Tonggang spent a lot of money on his wedding on January 10 and is currently unable to repay the debt. Three hundred yuan of the debt was borrowed through an introduction, and two hundred yuan was for his own use. The four guarantors Qin and Xu referred to Hu as "untrustworthy" and "cunning," intending to evade the debt. Therefore, they twisted and controlled him. Guo, a member of the district, then devised a plan, ordering Hu to repay forty yuan per month, which would be cleared within a year. When the written note was shown to Hu, the mute frowned and furrowed his brow, shaking his head to indicate that he could not do so. Then he wrote that he was unable to repay. As a result, Guo, a member of the district, had to tell them that lawsuits involving money and debt are civil matters and that they could file a lawsuit in court, as the bureau could not handle it. After seeing the note, each mute slightly made a gesture of compliance, awkwardly left, and went out the door. According to what someone told the reporter, when these six people entered the door, they seemed to have a bellyful of words to say, and there was no lack of anger between their eyebrows. However, when questioned, they used writing instead of speech and remained silent, showing the best attitude. Therefore, this scene in court can also be called "peaceful and calm." If it were non-mutes, the shouting and noise would be indescribable.</p>

<p>Zhongxi Pharmacy Can Be Resolved Immediately</p>
<p>Other Stores Are Also Under Negotiation</p>
<p>Joint Shareholders Denied in Court</p>
<p>Plaintiff's Lawyer Presented Evidence</p>
<p>After the Shanghai Day and Night Bank and the Great World Amusement Savings Department went bankrupt, the French Concession Court held its sixth hearing yesterday. In the afternoon, Judge Gong presided over the court. First, accountant Pan Zhaobang stated that the Zhongxi Pharmacy part could be resolved in about two or three days. The remaining companies, such as Xuan Chang Company, the hot spring bathhouse, and the Great World, are currently under negotiation. As for those who owe money to each household and have not repaid, lawsuits have been filed. Many have already repaid, and twenty percent can be distributed in advance to each creditor, etc. Only four shareholders, Ye Shantao, Zhao Qinbo, Zhou Songqing, and Chen Xingwu, hired lawyers Lu Shaozong, Wang Weizhen, Wu Zhiping, etc. to defend, claiming that their clients were not shareholders of the joint company and asked what evidence the plaintiff had. Lawyer Yan Luqing stated that if the defendants were not shareholders, why did they not object when they were published in various newspapers? Now the Social Bureau has transferred the list of shareholders to Chen Tingrui and the other four lawyers for safekeeping. Today, they can ask Lawyer Chen to submit the case for detailed examination. Lawyer Chen Tingrui then presented the photographs of the shareholders' list to the court, stating that the salaries and travel expenses taken by each shareholder each month have handwritten seals as proof. The lawyer representing Ye Shantao and the others argued that this photograph could not be used as evidence and that the original and definitive evidence must be submitted to take effect. At this point, Lawyer Chen presented the original three volumes of the shareholders' list to the court for review. Accountant Pan requested that the court allow the shareholders' books to be transferred to the shareholders for review to convince them. If they still want to deny, they must present counter-evidence. Peng Qi, representing the Wanchun Silver Group, argued that the Wanchun Silver Group was organized by Yixing Qianzhuang and other households. Because Huang Chujiu was ill, they hoped that he would return to spring like Wanchun, so the name was called Wanchun Silver Group, wanting to make him recover as soon as possible. Huang Chujiu went to Hangzhou for recuperation in December. Because the bank withdrew a lot of money, he returned to Shanghai and borrowed 300,000 yuan from the Wanchun Silver Group to repay each depositor. The method of paying the money was that the Day and Night Bank paid the depositors with promissory notes, which were transferred to each Qianzhuang for withdrawal. Each Qianzhuang then returned the notes to the Day and Night Bank, paying a total of 290,000 yuan. There is evidence that can be checked. Lawyer Yan Luqing then stood up and refuted that the Wanchun Silver Group contract was signed when Huang Chujiu was about to die, and the Day and Night Bank was in a panic of bankruptcy, which was invalid. The directors of the joint company cannot shirk their denial. Now the plaintiff has evidence to present, and each director should present counter-evidence. Lawyer Dong Yu stated that the money deposited by each creditor was hard-earned money and requested that the liquidator be instructed to distribute the money obtained first to provide relief. He also requested that the remaining part be disposed of as soon as possible to avoid consumption. Lawyer Tan Yigong, representing the Huang family, reported all of Huang Chujiu's property and detailed the real estate and movable property in a booklet to be submitted to the court for review. The lawyers then debated each other for a long time. Judge Gong approved the transfer of the three shareholders' lists submitted by Chen Tingrui and the other four lawyers and the evidence of the photographs submitted by the Wanchun Silver Group to accountants Pan and Wu for safekeeping.</p>
<p>The debate on the shareholders' part was postponed for fourteen days.</p>
<h3 id="e147">An Official Addict Really Has Bad Luck <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Spends Money and Gets Fooled</p>
<p>Is Detained Upon Arrival</p>
<p>A New Water Patrol Captain - At around eight o'clock yesterday morning, an uninvited guest suddenly arrived, well-dressed and carrying a letter of appointment in his hand (on which was written "Appointing Cheng Ding as Water Patrol Captain," etc., with complete seals). He went to the South City Water Patrol Headquarters to meet Captain Xu, claiming that he was named Cheng Ding and requesting a handover to take over the position. Captain Xu, believing that he had not received an order from his superiors to dismiss him, wondered where this unbelievable new captain came from. Therefore, he carefully examined the letter of appointment and discovered that it was forged. He immediately ordered the police to detain Cheng Ding, who claimed to be the new captain, for strict interrogation.</p>
<p>Spent One Hundred Silver Dollars - According to Cheng, he is twenty-four years old and from Nantong, Jiangsu. His brother is a rickshaw puller living at No. 4 London Road, Zhabei. I met a fellow villager named Cui Hao (Zi Lianen) at the Continental Hotel on Edward Road. We hit it off immediately. He claimed to be a good friend of the officials of the municipal authorities. Because I am currently unemployed, I mistakenly believed that he was a benefactor in front of me and could take the opportunity to promote me. I entrusted him to find me a position. He agreed readily and soon replied that the water patrol captain was about to be transferred, which was convenient to plot. However, I had to pay 400 yuan for the movement fee to get the letter of appointment to take office. I was overjoyed and returned home to first gather 100 silver dollars and give them to Cui. The remaining 300 yuan would be paid after I took office. Cui agreed and gave me the letter of appointment. Today, I came here hoping to take over the position smoothly. I didn't expect that the letter was forged and I was fooled. This is all Cui's fault alone, and I only lost one hundred yuan.</p>
<p>Plotting to Be the Third District Chief - He also said that there is one more thing I can tell you. Shen Changqing, who lives at No. 2, Lane 35, Huayuan Stone Bridge, Pudong, also asked Cui to plot to be the chief of the Third District of the Pudong Public Security Bureau at the Continental Hotel. I heard that he has succeeded and will take over soon. He is suffering the same fool as me.</p>
<p>Cui Still Lives in the Hotel - The captain checked the confession and immediately ordered detectives to go to the hotel, falsely claiming to visit Mr. Cui. The tea boy led them in to greet Cui. They also wanted to entrust Cui to find them a job. Cui replied that there was still a patrol officer vacancy in the water patrol team that he could plot. The detectives saw that Cui's tone had been recognized and showed the arrest warrant, taking Cui to the team. Cui suddenly changed his mind and refused to admit it. The captain ordered him to be interrogated more severely and sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation. He also notified Zhang, the chief of the Third District of Pudong, to go to the address to investigate Shen Changqing. Shen was not there, so he took his wife to the district for interrogation. His wife confessed that her husband had asked someone to plot to find a job outside, and she did not know anything about it. The district chief ordered her to stay in the district for further investigation.</p>

<p>Because Gu Han Made an Alliance, He Was Involved in the Lawsuit</p>
<p>The Content Is Quite Related to Morality</p>
<p>The Trial Was Opened Yesterday, and the Public Was Prohibited from Attending</p>
<p>Gu Yuncheng, also known as Gu Peinai, is a young man in his twenties from Shanghai, residing at No. 108, Daqing Lane, Nanjing Road, originally from Haizhou, Jiangsu. Wu Xuemei, a woman from Changzhou, lives across the street at No. 101. Wu is two years older than Gu and has a beautiful appearance. She is a modern woman. Gu coveted her beauty and imitated the frivolous actions of Deng Tuzi. Every time the woman went out, he secretly followed her. However, the woman never succumbed to his seduction. Gu then changed his seduction techniques. Because his mother's bedroom was directly opposite the woman's embroidered room, he would often throw buttons at the woman's window. The woman worried that her parents would see it, so she rebuked Gu at the window for being rude. Gu did not feel humiliated but proud and sincerely apologized, expressing his admiration and saying that he wanted to make a connection with her. The woman then fell into his trick. Not only did she not avoid him as before, but she became increasingly close to him. They traveled together, and soon they made a white-headed alliance with each other. However, both parents were still unaware. One day, Gu asked the woman to go to the Hongkou Swimming Pool. On the way, they turned into a hotel and dreamed of Gaotang. Afterwards, they pretended to watch swimming to practice the agreement of Sang and Pu. It has been five years since then. The woman repeatedly asked Gu to ask her parents to formally hire someone to propose marriage, but Gu was always vague. The woman was already pregnant the year before and urged him even more urgently. Gu only replied that the time was not right and told the woman that if she was afraid of ruining her reputation, she could abandon the baby when it was born. Later, the woman's belly grew bigger and her parents knew. Because her face was at stake, she secretly gave the baby to others after giving birth and dared not publicize it. Gu then showed off his complacency and did not know how to avoid taboos. He openly went back and forth and combined until now. The money that the woman was defrauded of also reached over two thousand yuan. Recently, the woman felt that it was not a good outcome if it was not resolved for a long time, so she hired a lawyer to send a letter to Gu's parents, requesting that they get married as soon as possible. Gu's father, Quan Chang, then knew about it. He replied to the letter, agreeing that his son was an adult and that the parents would not restrict his marriage and would let him choose freely. The woman then urged Gu to hold the wedding, but Gu still used strict family education and the parents' disapproval as excuses. The woman realized that Gu had no intention of marrying her, but she had lost her chastity and lost her money, so she was unwilling and sued him for three crimes: harming morality, harming the family, and defrauding money to the Special District Court. The defendant was not present at the court hearing the other day, and the lawyer requested a postponement, saying that the defendant had gone to Qingdao and had not returned. Judge Cheng provisionally granted the request and postponed the hearing until yesterday afternoon. The defendant's lawyer said that the defendant had not returned to Shanghai. The plaintiff's lawyer asked the defendant to start the trial immediately because the defendant was intentionally evading. Judge Cheng then questioned the plaintiff about the process of falling in love. Because there were many details related to morality in this case, the court prohibited the public from attending. After questioning until dusk, the court adjourned and heard that a warrant would be issued to arrest the defendant Gu Yuncheng and investigate him.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Bandits Openly Extort <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Repeatedly Invited to Hotels for Negotiations</p>
<p>Transfer Implemented on Xizang Road</p>
<p>Detectives Arrested by Surprise</p>
<p>Yan Songtao, the owner of the Xinjinji Construction Factory, had received six threatening letters in the past month, extorting money and agreeing to negotiate at a hotel on Zhejiang Road. Yan's residence is located at No. 317, Xin'er Lane, Datong Road, Xinzha. Therefore, according to intelligence, he requested the Xinzha Police Station to investigate. The police chief sent a detective to guard Room 214 of the hotel to observe the movements, but after guarding for a day, he did not see any traces of the bandits, thinking that the bandits had changed their plans. However, on Saturday evening of the previous week at dusk at 5:00 p.m., the postman delivered a letter to Yan's residence. After reading it, it was still a bandit letter, saying that even though you had implemented the previous agreement to clear the room at the hotel, there were too many people going there, so it was inconvenient to come out and negotiate. Now, I hereby renew the previous agreement and still use the hotel as the place for negotiation. You must go there on time. Yan reported the arrest again and sent detectives Ruan Yao and Yang Feizhang to the hotel to sit in a room. At about 3:00 p.m., the telephone in the room rang loudly. The detective held the microphone and heard the other party say: Are you Mr. Yan or Mr. Yan's representative? The detective reported as a representative. The other party continued to say: Is the payment ready? How much is it? Please tell me immediately. The detective replied: I have 200 or 300 gold. At this point, the bell rang again, and I did not hear what followed. An hour later, the bandit informed by phone to change the place of negotiation, asking to send someone with a calendar of the month, going west from the hotel to Xizang Road and turning north into Baike Road. Someone will be waiting on the way. Detective Yang followed the instructions, holding a calendar of the month in one hand and a paper bag in the other, pretending to be 300 yuan in the bag. He walked to Baike Road, and a person on the side of the road suddenly asked Yang if he was Mr. Yan's representative. Yang nodded and handed over the paper bag, returning to ask his name. This person took the bag and then wrote the two words Wang Kai and gave it to Yang. The detective expected that Wang Kai was the name of this bandit and unexpectedly grabbed him from behind and brought him back to the police station. The police chief interrogated him, and the bandit confessed that his name was Chen Yi from Hangzhou. The police chief asked who Wang Kai was and where he was hiding. He said that he was still waiting for him at the Sihai Shenping Lou teahouse on Fuzhou Road, waiting for him to return. When the detectives rushed to check and catch him, Wang had already checked out like Huang He. It turned out that they had a meeting time, and when they did not see him return after the time had passed, they knew that the incident had been revealed, so Wang escaped. Yesterday morning, the police station sent this bandit to the Special District Court. After Judge Ge Zhitian interrogated him, because the police station still had to investigate the accomplices to find out if there were any other cases, etc., which could not be determined at present, he ordered him to be temporarily detained pending investigation and further interrogation.</p>

<p>Chen Xintian Did All Kinds of Evil</p>
<p>Chen Shijin Sought Revenge for His Father</p>
<p>Chen Xintian is a native of Daye County, Hubei Province, and is registered as a member of the Communist Party. He worked hard to publicize communism in his hometown. The villagers were afraid of his arrogance and dared not resist. Chen Xintai, a member of the clan, was very clear about justice and wanted to eliminate him to get rid of the scourge, but he was not Chen Xintian's opponent. On June 28 last summer, he was killed. The will to eliminate evil was not realized, and he died with hatred. His relatives and friends mourned him, and he had five sons who wanted to continue his father's will and seek revenge for their father. So, they worked together to seize the opportunity to plot. Chen Xintian knew that he was intolerable in his hometown. At the end of last year, he took his wife and children and fled to other places. A few days ago, he arrived in Shanghai after several twists and turns and hid at No. 296 Yangshupu Road, thinking that the enemy could not easily find him and he could sleep soundly. However, before he could catch his breath and his luggage was unloaded, the son of the deceased, Chen Shijin, had tracked him to Shanghai, found out where he was, and rushed to the Municipal Public Security Bureau to request that the police station quickly arrest him to prevent him from escaping when he heard the news. Director Chen has always worked hard to eradicate communism and immediately sent detective Han to coordinate with the Chinese and foreign detectives of the Yangshupu Police Station. The day before yesterday, they secretly went to Chen's residence and took Chen Xintian, his wife Zhang, and two young children into the police station and detained them separately. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Special District Court to be investigated. Detective Han presented the official letter and requested extradition. Lawyer Li Zhishan of the police station stated that the police station never wanted to protect bandits who committed crimes and fled to the concession. There was no objection to the inland official request for extradition. Judge Feng Shide briefly interrogated the criminal and ordered the four members of Chen Xintian's family to be handed over to the detectives of the Municipal Public Security Bureau to be transferred to the Daye County Government of Hubei Province for investigation and handling.</p>

<p>The case of boatman Lu A'gen (wrongly reported as Luo A'gen in yesterday's newspaper) who died from being harmed by Detective Chief Zhang Zhaoxiang of the Fourth District Shui Public Security Team has been reported yesterday. Yesterday morning, the deceased's grandmother Lu Yangshi, his wife Lu Liushi, and the fourteen-year-old cook on the boat, Lu Genxiang, went to the court to submit a petition, stating that the deceased Lu A'gen had loaded 150 bales of cotton from the Hengxing Huahang in the Yangjing District on March 2 of this year and unloaded them at the Yong'an Spinning Mill in Wusong. The next day, when he arrived in front of the Dakang Spinning Mill, he was suddenly falsely accused of being stolen goods by Zhang Zhaoxiang, who arrested the people, the boat, and the goods and detained them in the Fourth District Headquarters, extorting 1,000 yuan. After the employer learned about it, he filed a complaint in the court before the deceased was released to the court. Zhang was summoned and questioned several times, but Zhang avoided and dared not come. Therefore, he was ordered to release the deceased and return the flower boat to the Fourth District on March 27. On the morning of the 28th, at 12:00 noon, the deceased met with Zhang Zhaoxiang to inspect the cotton and was encroached upon by more than 10 dan. Therefore, he asked Zhang to go to the Yong'an Spinning Mill for unloading to prove that he was exempt from compensation. However, Zhang cursed and punched, causing fatal injuries. The deceased died from his injuries at 8:00 p.m. The body is now parked at the Yongsheng Wharf in the South City. The place where he was beaten was in the Yuncao Ham. Lu Genxiang, who was cooking, witnessed it, etc. When Prosecutor Yang Qi opened the court for questioning, Lu Genxiang testified that the deceased was slapped on the ear by Zhang Zhaoxiang, causing his face to swell and being kicked twice in the abdomen. Prosecutor Yang immediately ordered that Zhang Zhaoxiang, who had recently been accused of extorting thousands of yuan by speedboat owner Guo Shixin and others, be arrested and detained by the Fourth District. In the afternoon, he brought inspectors to the scene to inspect the body and determine that the most fatal part of the deceased was the death caused by a slap to the ear. He then ordered the family to collect the body and wait for the arrest and punishment of the perpetrator.</p>

<p>American Official Ordered the Return to the United States</p>
<p>The Da Mei Evening News reports that Chinese-American Hua Yinsui (transliteration), a native of Guangdong, married a European woman in New York, USA, and adopted a child. However, due to discord with the woman, he took the child back to Shanghai alone in May of last year. His wife in the United States immediately requested the police to request the American authorities to return the child. The US State Department telegraphed the Shanghai American Official Order Office. The child was detained on the day of his arrival in Shanghai pending trial. At this moment, the case has been tried by American Official Order Pandi and sentenced to return the child to his adoptive mother. The four-year-old child will now be sent back to the United States.</p>

<p>Dear Editor, On the 30th of this month, your newspaper published news from this city, stating that a seventy-year-old woman filed a lawsuit against her grandson for being beaten to death, which mentioned the Wuxing Huahang in Yangjing Town, Pudong (opened by Chen Tianxi, a member of the Yangsi Township Municipal Committee). There were discrepancies. It was found that Hengxing Huahang had other shareholders and was not opened by me, and the brand name of the company was Hengxing, not Wuxing. I am afraid that the rumors are untrue. I specially sent a letter to correct them and asked you to publish the letter in the corrections column to conform to the facts. Thank you very much. Sincerely, Chen Tianxi</p>

<h3 id="e156">Small Records of Huanghuagang and the Seventy-Two Martyrs' Tomb <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>— Li Qingduo</p>
<p>On March 29th of the Xinhai year, revolutionaries launched an uprising in Guangzhou to attack the Governor-General's Office of Guangdong and Guangxi. Seventy-two people died in the battle against the Qing officials, who were prepared. They were buried in Huanghuagang, known as the Huanghuagang Seventy-Two Martyrs' Tomb. Although the revolutionaries did not succeed in this battle, their iron-blooded souls served as pioneers of the revolution, chilling the Qing officials' hearts and souls. Their great achievements are enough to be immortalized. As we commemorate the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang, please talk about the situation of Huanghuagang. Huanghuagang is located in the eastern suburbs of Guangzhou. It is necessary to pass through it on the way to Shahe Road. Enter through the tomb path first and go straight through the secluded path. Cars can directly reach the tomb. The entire tomb is built with stone and cement, and the shape is very magnificent. Ascend the steps for dozens of steps to reach the cemetery. The four sides of the cemetery are surrounded by stone railings, and flowers and trees are planted on both sides of the tomb, which is very elegant and clean. A stone memorial arch is built behind the tomb, with the memorial stones of the seventy-two martyrs donated by overseas party departments stacked on the upper end. The lower end has the words "Noble Spirit Will Last Forever" inscribed by President Sun, which are engraved on the stone wall. This was written in the tenth year of the Republic of China. The characters are grand and majestic. A music stage is built on the left side of the tomb, and a memorial monument to the seventy-two martyrs and a register of the seventy-two martyrs are built on the right side of the tomb, which are all browsed and read by visitors. There is also a memorial pavilion for tourists to rest. Every year on March 29th, the military and political leaders of Guangdong Province must lead all walks of life to pay tribute. The ceremony is very grand. The Shahe Road is very prosperous for a while. It is heard that many foreign tourist groups and foreign envoys who arrive in Guangdong also go to mourn, which shows that the loyalty and martyrdom of the seventy-two martyrs are deeply moving.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Effective Prescription for Treating Meningitis <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— Jie Lu</p>
<p>Since the arrival of spring, meningitis has once again been rampant in various regions. Patients often die within a day or two, making it the most dreaded infectious disease of the season. In the spring of the year before last, this disease was prevalent in my hometown. My younger cousin's wife, Ms. Li, who had been married for less than half a year, suddenly contracted this epidemic. Initially, she felt headaches and sore throat, and soon after, she experienced vomiting, delirium, and a stiff neck. Chinese medicine was used to treat it as a spring epidemic, while Western medicine lacked available serum injection agents. Extracting fluid only caused the patient more suffering. Thus, this delicate and beautiful woman tragically passed away. Is it not a sorrowful event? In recent years, I have been frequently ill and lamenting the many unjust deaths in the world. I have studied medicine and suddenly realized that meningitis should be treated with cooling agents to achieve the most effective results. In the early stages, it is advisable to take Zijing Pills to detoxify and suppress vomiting, followed by medications such as Forsythia, Bai Ju Hua, Chrysanthemum, Kuding Tea, and Antelope Horn, which will surely bring about a miraculous recovery. As for preventive methods, one should use hair-removed and cleaned loquat leaves or white chrysanthemum to make tea for regular consumption. Gargling with salt water in the morning and tightly covering the mouth when going out are all essential preventive measures. This disease is more common in children, and it is most easily transmitted during the spring when the weather warms up. Therefore, children must be vaccinated and cautious about their diet and exposure to cold and heat. As for us adults, we should urgently pay attention to personal hygiene to strengthen our body's antitoxins, so that the fierce disease demon will surely retreat.</p>
<h3 id="e158">New Atmosphere in the Capital <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— Hui Zi</p>
<p>▲ The Rapid Progress of Road Construction: The 7,500-meter-long Zhongshan Avenue has been praised by Chinese and foreign men and women as a top-tier tourist destination. Recently, the municipal government has been keenly focused on road construction. The most prosperous and bustling section of the Meridian Line Road, the Huapailou section, began construction yesterday. The street is being widened uniformly, with the storefronts on both sides being set back dozens of feet to create a wide avenue. The Commercial Press Branch and the Zhonghua Book Company, among others, are being demolished. The shacks and iron sheds along Zhongshan Road have been ordered by the police to be demolished within a limited time. Approximately 260 households north of the Drum Tower must relocate elsewhere immediately. From now on, those visiting the capital from various regions will no longer see only shacks and grass huts lining the streets upon entering the city, creating a desolate impression.</p>
<p>▲ The Rise and Fall of Entertainment Venues: Nanjing has nine movie theaters. The Guomin and Shijie theaters exclusively show sound films. The Xinguang and Zhongyang theaters show domestically produced films. The Mingxing, Shudu, and Datong theaters show silent films, while the Zhonghua theater has ceased operations in Nanjing, reportedly to install sound equipment. The Guomin theater is the most particular about its facilities, seating, location, and film selection, and therefore its business is the most prosperous. The Shijie and Nanjing theaters come next, but their business fluctuates. The Mingxing and Shudu theaters, both newly opened, are attracting customers by lowering prices, which shows the decline of the film industry. After all, the capital only has one-sixth of the total population of Shanghai, one-third of that of Beiping, and one-half of that of Tianjin. Where can one find so many customers? This is evidenced by the fact that the capital's two entertainment venues, the Dashijie and the Minye Company, are both suffering losses.</p>
<p>▲ The Establishment of the Military Medical Supervision Department: Since the Ministry of Health was reduced in scope to become the Health Administration, it could only accommodate 120 people. The positions of the remaining 100 to 200 people became a problem. Fortunately, the precedent of creating positions based on people's needs has been seen many times. Thus, the Military Medical Supervision Department was established. Because its functions overlap with those of the Military Medical Division of the Ministry of Military Affairs, they were divided so that the Military Medical Division handles military hygiene, while the Military Medical Supervision Department handles military medical education. It is nothing more than carving out a portion from within the scope of the Military Medical Division to establish a separate agency. The head of the Military Medical Supervision Department is a lieutenant general, and under him are more than 20 major general military doctors and more than 30 colonel military doctors, equivalent to a department under the Executive Yuan. A model military hospital is established separately, with the hospital director being a major general medical officer and the staff all being colonels. The organization of military hospitals in various units is much smaller than this. However, all military medical personnel are celebrating, saying, "We don't have to worry about not having a way out!"</p>
<h3 id="e159">Record of a Strange Habit: Sleeping on Gold <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>— Zui Chi Sheng</p>
<p>My neighbor is a Mrs. Zhang, who is over sixty years old. She is frugal and lives alone in a small room since her sons and daughters-in-law have moved out. She only employs a maid to serve her. She has been paralyzed and moaning in bed for a long time. Recently, she suddenly fell critically ill and passed away. When her family was preparing for the funeral, they examined her bed and found that her pillows and bedding were padded with silver dollars and banknotes almost everywhere, totaling several thousand silver dollars. It is said that the maid had been gradually pilfering some. These accumulated items were all savings from Mrs. Zhang's frugal living. However, since she did not store them in a bank or hide them in a chest, but used them as padding, it is quite amusing. Yesterday, I was drinking at a friend's house, and after a few drinks, I happened to mention this old woman's habit of sleeping on gold. Mr. Jiang, who was present, said, "This is nothing. I once had a landlord, Mr. Lu, who had been a comprador for a foreign firm. He was wealthy but extremely stingy. His wife and son had both passed away early, leaving only a personal maid. He died at the age of fifty, leaving behind a grandson who was only eight years old. The amount of gold he left hidden was quite shocking. When Mr. Lu was on his deathbed, he repeatedly pointed to his bedding, indicating something. His mattress was particularly thick, about five inches high. When it was opened, it was filled with HSBC banknotes, totaling 300,000 yuan. These two people share the same habit, but compared to Mr. Lu, the woman pales in comparison." I laughed and said, "Mr. Lu had wealth but could not use it, so he used 300,000 yuan as bedding, surrounding himself with money day and night, creating a new record in the history of misers. Even in death, Mr. Lu can be proud of himself. However, he treated money like his life, possessing huge sums of money without allowing it to circulate, and even depleting interest on it. Is this considered 'frugal' or 'extravagant'? I dare not comment. In short, his foolishness is unparalleled." Everyone said, "Then we drinkers are the ones who can thoroughly understand the 'philosophy of life.'" So we raised several large cups in succession.</p>
<p>Zui Chi Sheng also said: Our country, like the Northeast and Northwest regions, is full of resources everywhere. Yet, we hide gold in the ground without knowing how to develop it, instead inviting the covetousness of foreigners. The owners, in turn, worry about poverty every day and borrow foreign debts to support themselves. Compared to hiding gold in a bed, which can still be left to descendants, there seems to be a difference. So why should I criticize the woman and Mr. Lu?</p>
<h3 id="e160">Ten Thousand People Vie to See Zi Luolan <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>— Shuang Hong</p>
<p>Ms. Zi Luolan, a Cantonese singer and dancer, has come south again, and her reputation has grown even more. Ms. Zi Luolan is beautiful and talented with a naturally gifted voice. She is proficient in all kinds of Chinese and foreign songs and dances, and she is also skilled in Peking opera, which is especially rare and valuable. During her days in Shanghai, every time she performed, the audience was packed, with no empty seats. Now, her tour in Bai Xia (Nanjing) is also extremely popular. People from all walks of life are eager to catch a glimpse of her beauty. Since Ms. Zi Luolan arrived in the capital, she has been warmly welcomed by all sectors, and famous people have been hosting banquets for her almost every day. The joint winter relief association of various sectors specially invited Ms. Zi Luolan to dance on the eighth. That day happened to be a day off, and the people of the capital, impressed by Ms. Zi Luolan's fame, created an unprecedented record of crowding and congestion to see her. Those who arrived late and could not get in were not few. On the evening of the ninth, Ms. Zi Luolan hosted a reception for newspaper reporters at the Shijie Hotel. A certain gentleman delivered a speech on her behalf, and his words were very appropriate. The guests all expressed their satisfaction. The next day, all the newspapers in the capital published extensive reports of thousands of words, praising her to the highest degree. Ms. Zi Luolan can be very proud of this. Starting on the fourteenth, she was hired by the Guomin Theater to perform for three days, two shows each day. The first day was "Mei Fei," "Wu Jia Po," and a toe dance. The second day was "Daiyu Buries Flowers," "San Niang Teaches Her Son," and an Egyptian dance. The third day was "Chen Miaochang Sits in the Palace" and a Zi Luolan dance. All of these are masterpieces of Ms. Zi Luolan's life. During these three days, the area around Yanggong Well was crowded with people and vehicles. The capital's entertainment venues have never been so lively, and it can be said that it broke records. As I write this, I recall a friend saying that before the Northern Expedition's oath-taking rally in the fifteenth year, Ms. Zi Luolan, although very young, was already famous for her songs and dances in the city of Guangzhou. Important Cantonese figures such as Li Jishen had already appreciated her and would call upon her to sing and dance to help boost the atmosphere at important banquets. When the Northern Expeditionary Army was about to depart, all the important figures held a banquet for Commander-in-Chief Jiang, who also summoned Ms. Zi Luolan to sing. Her melodious voice was like a new oriole coming out of the valley, and Commander-in-Chief Jiang applauded and praised her, saying to those present, "I hope that on the day of the Northern Expedition's success, I can listen to this song with you all again." Now that Ms. Zi Luolan has come to the capital, it is just after the pacification and unification of China. Commander-in-Chief Jiang may not have forgotten his previous words.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Travels in India (10) <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— Ling Hua</p>
<p>On the 28th, Consul Lu and his wife invited me to dinner, and they also invited two friends from Ceylon (Sri Lanka). We had a lively discussion about the differences in customs. I was very interested and asked the Ceylonese people which is more likely to win in a fight between an elephant and a tiger. They replied that tigers are good at jumping. When fighting an elephant, they can jump onto the elephant's nose. Therefore, even though the elephant is brave, it is useless and it will be defeated and injure its head. From this point of view, it is not certain whether the previous practice of the Burmese people using tigers and elephants for fighting as a form of entertainment is a common occurrence. The Ceylonese people told me that elephants sometimes fight each other, but only male elephants fight; females do not fight. I asked how elephants are captured. They replied that they make a deep pit, place food on top, and cover it with dirt so that the elephant will approach the food and fall into the pit. After several days without food, they use five or seven people to pull it with iron ropes, and then it can be subdued.</p>
<p>The Ceylonese people told me that the customs of Ceylon are very different from those of India because there is no class division. In India, the four classes do not intermarry and cannot eat together. It is the strangest thing in the world. One day, I returned home late and had missed dinner. I thought of looking for a restaurant. I walked four or five miles and it was raining, but I could not find one. It was very strange. When I asked the Indians and Ceylonese friends, I learned that it was due to the caste system of Hinduism. People of different religions do not eat together, and people of different classes do not eat together. Restaurants cannot be opened for everyone, so everyone has to eat separately. The Ceylonese people told me that the strangest thing is that if a servant makes food for the family and the master has finished eating, even if there is a lot of leftover food, the servant will never eat it. They must throw it all away, start a new fire, cook again, and eat it themselves. This strange custom is incomprehensible. Also, tea from people of different religions cannot be shared, and even all objects cannot be used in common. There are many taboos. I find it very strange and think that the British should be very happy that they can permanently maintain this iron-clad system without change, which is for their submissive people. If these bad customs are not changed, I do not believe that the Indians can be free. An Indian told me that if the Indian caste system (i.e., caste) wants to be washed away, it will have to wait until Russian culture sweeps it away completely.</p>
<p>On the 29th, Saturday morning, I read about the World Religious Federation's anti-war conference in Geneva. Chen Huanzhang of Peking Confucius University also attended and gave a speech explaining the meaning of benevolence and love in the Spring and Autumn Annals. Xin Hanjun, the secretary of the Mahayana Buddhist Association, showed me a historical map of the life of Buddha, which was very interesting. I began to feel a deep sense of understanding. In the afternoon, the clerk, Bao Mike (J. Bhoumick), accompanied me to the zoo. We took a streetcar from the side of the university and changed cars once to get to (Kidderpore). After getting off, it cost two annas per person and we walked more than a hundred steps to get there. Buying a ticket cost one anna to enter. The clear stream in the big pond was very lovely. Mandarin ducks were swimming. I immediately saw two tigers seeming to be fighting. I was reminded of my poem that the cat is a small tiger and the tiger is a big cat. I have rarely seen cats fighting and even less often seen tigers fighting, except for people scolding tigers. In fact, the nature of tigers is much better than that of humans. When we arrived, they were indeed not fighting, but the two tigers were bathing and playing in the water, with only an iron railing separating them. From a distance, they appeared to be in the same pond. Further on, we saw two big elephants. The elephant is the largest animal on land. I once wrote a poem praising it. Its eyes are small. I bought bananas and held them in my hand on its nose, and each of them took the food to eat. The elephant is an herbivore like the cow. But I asked the Indian people whether there were any white elephants like the Buddha had, and they replied that they had not seen any. The birds were in the same large field. As soon as I entered, I heard beautiful sounds in the air. My Indian friend said that these were fairy birds, called Paradise Birds in English. They are beautiful and sing well. There are many kinds of parrots, some with colorful eyes and bodies. But the Beijing Zoo is not weaker than this. The price of buying a parrot here is not cheaper than in Beijing. There are many carnivorous birds. There is a kind of deer with four horns, each two feet long, two growing forward and two growing to the sides, which is also strange.</p>

<h3 id="e162">Gold Bar Trends Are Uncertain <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Extremely Unstable Advances and Retreats Yesterday, March 30th, the gold bar market seemed to have slightly increased, but the market conditions remained uncertain. The difference between the high and low for the entire day amounted to eleven taels, mainly due to the stable trend of foreign exchange and unchanged prices. There were disputes between buyers and sellers in the market, but the buyers remained strong. Companies such as Da Xing Yong, Cui Chang Yong, Qian Chang, Xiang Cheng Feng Yong, and others were all buyers, while Fu Chang, Heng Xing, and Xin Heng mostly sold their positions. The slight rise in overseas silver markets did not have much impact, and the gold price showed a hidden upward trend. Later, due to the eager selling pressure and the apparent easing of exchange rates, the market was in a weak state, and the price plummeted by ten taels, dropping from 697 taels to 86 taels. Afterwards, the price fluctuated, sometimes rising and sometimes falling by three or four taels. However, the momentum seemed to be upward. The cash flow of various companies in the afternoon varied. It was initially stable, then firm. It was heard that India was selling a large batch of silver blocks, which caused the price to reach a peak. However, it fluctuated around four or five taels from time to time. Finally, the buying momentum was strong, and the evening market stood at around 696 taels. The spot price of bare bars remained stable, with the term delivery increasing by more than nine taels.</p>
<p>Multiple Changes in the Morning From the opening in the morning, the May contract slightly increased by three mace to 694 taels and five mace. According to the telegram from the previous day, the price of large silver bars only increased by one-eighth, the long-term contract increased by one-sixteenth, and the silver price increased by one-quarter. The market sentiment was stable. Soon after, companies such as Cheng Feng Yong, Qian Chang, Xiang Cheng, Yuan Xing Yong, Da De Cheng, and others started to buy, and because Taiwan first absorbed the short-term and long-term English gold at 13875, the price was raised to 97 taels and five mace. After a while, Heng Xing, Tong Tai Chang, Yuan Cheng Yong, and others came to sell, and the price immediately moved downward. Then Fu Chang, Fu Yu, and others followed and sold, and the price suddenly fell by ten taels within the 90 tael range, plummeting to 88 taels. The English gold also increased by 0.0625, and the bank absorbed it at 9375. When the first order was announced, the price was 91 and a half taels, with no changes. Only Yu Da, Cui Chang Yong, and others bought in. Then it was 94 taels. Later, Mitsui sold the May gold at 1 tael, five mace, two cents and seventy-five thousandths, and also absorbed the April Citibank at 32 yuan and 3125 thousandths. And because Tong Tai Chang, Xin Heng, Yuan Heng Yuan Cheng, and others successively divested, coupled with the strengthening of English gold, which could be settled at 9375, and the Chinese and Japanese banks bought the recent term at 14, the gold price plummeted by seven or eight taels. At ten o'clock and ten minutes, it fell to 86 taels. Afterwards, Yong Feng Qian Chang Xiang and others bought in, and the price rose to 91 taels and 87 mace in an instant. After that, there were three taels of fluctuations in both directions, hovering around 90 taels. After ten o'clock and three quarters, the sellers did not stop, and the price retreated within 90 taels. Almost at eleven o'clock and one quarter, it was 88 taels. Then it was bought by the China Banking Corporation at the recent term English gold price of 9375, and Qian Chang Xiang, Yong Feng Tong Tai Chang, Yuan Mao Yong, and others chased in. In half an hour, it jumped up by more than five taels. At eleven o'clock and three quarters, it was 93 taels and five mace. The merchandise was sold as a set, and because the English gold bank buying price still had to be 14, it dropped to 90 taels. At noon, the market closed at 91 taels and three mace. The announced price was still 759 taels, with a discount of 67 or 8 taels to 72 or 3 taels. At noon, it was 68 taels.</p>
<p>Afternoon Market Slightly Upward The afternoon opened at 91 and a half taels, then 92 and a half taels. Later, due to the increase in the Indian exchange telegram by three annas, it dropped to 91 taels. Suddenly, it was heard that India was selling a large number of silver bars in the London market, and the market sentiment improved immediately. It jumped up by more than five taels to 96 taels and five mace at 2:10. Afterwards, English gold weakened, and Mitsui sold the June contract at 9375. Especially since the Indian exchange rate continued to rise by four annas, Ri Chang tended to sell, and it depreciated by five taels in half an hour, to 91 taels and five mace at 2:45. After 3 o'clock, the market improved. The buyers on the trading floor were still strong. Companies such as Cui Chang Yong, Qian Chang Xiang, and various other firms successively took action, and the price rose by three taels. At 4 o'clock, due to settlement reasons, it was raised to 96 taels. Then, the afternoon's re-entry of accounts added five taels in half an hour, and afterwards, it fluctuated by slightly more than one tael, totaling four and a half to six taels. When the market closed at 4:30, it was 95 taels and six mace, an increase of one tael and four mace compared to last Saturday. It continued to trade to six taels and zero. The highest price for the day was 97 taels and five mace, and the lowest price was 86 taels, with a fluctuation of 11 taels and five mace. The premium for merchandise was 3 taels and five mace in the morning, 1 tael at noon, 1 tael in the afternoon, and 5 taels and three mace at the close. The announced price was discounted by 67 or 8 taels to 63 taels. The entered price was 87 taels to 91 taels in the morning and 92 taels to 96 taels in the afternoon. The make-up water was 84 taels to 89 taels.</p>
<p>Generally Confused Trading The trading of various companies included Cui Chang Yong, Cheng Feng Yong, Qian Chang Xiang, Yong Feng, Fu Tai Heng, Shun He, Wan Xing, Yuan Xing Yong, Da Xing Yong, Yu Da, all buying in.

<h3 id="e164">Active Foreign Exchange Market Due to Securities Delivery <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Market Overview Foreign exchange transactions have not been frequent in recent days. Yesterday, there was a huge demand for securities delivery, so transactions were several times higher than usual. However, if the price were to be averaged, with both supply and demand being high, it would be more seller than buyer. As a result, it was lower than expected. The silver dollar delivery was also busy because the bank was closed on Monday.</p>
<p>Brokerage Prices (Foreign cents) The early market brokerage price was very competitive, resulting in a higher supply and therefore the price was softer at 7 cents 2 fen 4 li and a half, a fall of half a li compared to the previous day's noon market. The power of both parties in the noon market was equal, so the brokerage price was the same as the morning market, with no difference. (Silver breakup) The early market was five fen, and the noon market was four fen, an increase of one or two fen compared to the previous day. Initially, the haircut was four or five fen, then three fen, and finally there was even a white haircut. Thus, the ample working capital of silver can be seen across the board.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market The early market price for Jiangnan small foreign coins was 6 mace 3 fen 5 li, and the noon market was 6 mace 3 fen 6 li, a better price of one li compared to the previous day.

The early market price for Guangdong small foreign coins was 6 mace 3 fen, and the noon market was 6 mace 3 fen 0.8 hao and 7 hu and a half. The transaction volume was 190,000 jiao in the morning market and 100,500 jiao in the noon market. The copper coins suddenly shrank by 2,500 wen to 368,500 wen, still falling below the 70,000 wen level.</p>
<p>Silver Dollar Inflows and Outflows (Silver) Yesterday, the number of deliveries at bank openings and closings was relatively high, and it was also the end of the month, so the number of closing and delivery was also particularly high.

<h3 id="e166">A GlimPSE OF COTTON YARN DELIVERY THIS MONTH <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Seller's Side: Tai Wo Foreign Firm is the Largest</p>
<p>Buyer's Side: A Certain Factory and Ruida are the Largest</p>
<p>In March, the highest bid for yarn in February 26th and 27th reached 181 taels and 5 mace. Afterwards, due to slow spring sales and falling gold prices, the market slightly declined, hovering around 172-173 taels at the beginning of the month. However, the yarn business still showed no development. Longer exchange rates and the decline in the cotton market led to weakening confidence, gradually trending lower with a sharp decline, reaching a low of 159 taels and 8 mace. Shortly after, there was news of actual demand developing, and the loading of Japanese yarn increased daily. Japanese foreign firms were actively searching for Japanese yarn in the market, making the base yarn very tight. Most of the Japanese factories' goods for August and September were sold out. Shenxin Factory also sold a considerable amount of 20-count "Human Clock" yarn. At the same time, the Qingdao group purchased a large quantity of 16-count local yarn in Shanghai because the Japanese factories' goods in Qingdao were also bought up by the Japanese, leaving no goods available locally, so they turned to Shanghai for procurement. As a result, confidence greatly increased, and the market suddenly turned around, reaching 168 taels and 5 mace again. However, some sellers had purchased a considerable amount of 20-count "Five Blessings" and "Shepherd" yarn last year at low prices, exerting strong pressure. Nevertheless, a certain manufacturer on the buyer's side adopted a very firm attitude, with a strong interest in the continuous export trade to the East, showing no intention of letting go. The final bid for delivery this month was 165 taels and 5 mace, resulting in a total delivery of 10,400 bales. Among the sellers, over 5,000 bales of new yarn were delivered, with only 1,000 bales of 20-count "Five Blessings" and 1,600 bales of "Shepherd" being actually delivered. The rest were self-delivered, with Tai Wo Foreign Firm delivering the most. A certain manufacturer and Ruida both received the most goods. The delivery price was 167 taels.

<p>Mostly Machine-picked Cotton</p>
<p>The cotton bidding in March, on February 25th and 26th, showed an exceptionally strong trend. Due to the good political situation in India and rising market prices, gold prices also soared, resulting in a very high combined silver price. This caused panic, reaching an extreme point with concerns about a cotton shortage. The highest price reached 46 taels. Later, with support from buyers releasing some cotton, the market calmed down, hovering around 43 taels in early March. Shortly after, as foreign cotton prices fell back and gold prices dropped by over 100 taels, some bulls closed their positions, and the market gradually moved downwards, with a sharp decline. The lowest price reached below 39 taels, after which it entered a period of fluctuation. In the middle, due to the lack of vitality in the overseas cotton market and exchange rates, confidence was low, and prices hovered around the 40 taels mark. However, with thin inventories at the bottom, the market was able to stabilize. The final bid was 40 taels and 5 mace, resulting in a delivery price of 40 taels and 5 mace, totaling 25,300 dan. Among them, 9,000 dan were machine-picked cotton and 100 dan were Taicang cotton. The rest were self-delivered. The amounts for both the seller and buyer sides are listed below:</p>

<p>SPOT COTTON IS QUIET, TRANSACTIONS ARE SLUGGISH</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market is improving, as actual sales are smooth and northern areas are keen to purchase, resulting in a shortage of Japanese yarn and firm prices. A large merchant in the exchange received 2,000 bales of standard 20-count "Five Blessings" and "Shepherd" yarn, which have been shipped to Guangdong today. However, most players in the market have a consistent bearish outlook due to their thick inventories. According to a partial survey, there are about 140,000 to 150,000 bales, excluding those in other locations. Sales of spot yarn are still fairly good. According to statistics, various groups bought a total of 1,450 bales, with 75 bales purchased by fellow traders. The price trend for Japanese yarn is rising. Among the buying groups, Qingdao bought 600 bales, Tianjin bought 500 bales, Hankou bought 50 bales, Xuzhou bought 40 bales, Guangdong bought 105 bales, the northern group bought 25 bales, Jiangxi bought 40 bales, and miscellaneous groups bought 100 bales. The spot cotton market is quiet, and no factories have been heard to have started operations, but the trend is still firm. According to sources, 100 bales of Yao cotton have arrived.</p>

<p>Bombay: Although futures prices fluctuated last week, the trend remained firm. The price of Oomra remained relatively high because all of the 23,300 bales for the March delivery were absorbed by well-known Japanese merchants. The Indian cotton statistics are sufficient to make Indian cotton strong. In the spot market, Japanese merchants bought Oomra, and European exporters bought Gast and Appendices. The statistics for the past week are as follows (unit: 1,000 bales):</p>

<p>Liverpool's spot demand was very good last week. Futures trading was thin. Market conditions were unstable due to the US Department of Agriculture's lack of a clear statement. Currently, it is awaiting the development of new cotton. The Egyptian cotton market was calm and firm.</p>
<h3 id="e171">RICE MARKET IN GRAIN AND RIVER DEPOT IS SLUGGISH <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, around 30 boats arrived at the river depot. Due to poor sales, there were over 200 boats in stock. Therefore, although there has been cloudy and rainy weather recently, confidence remains bearish on white glutinous rice. The market trend was barely holding at the original level. Secondary grades were slightly reduced. The morning market also slightly tightened by a few points, but soon returned. Early indica rice was stagnant with no increase or decrease. Yangdu pointed rice and guest depot pointed rice were uniformly stable. Transactions were scarce, and the situation was sluggish. The change to cloudy weather made purchases of raw rice rare, and the appetite for purchases was very weak due to the cloudy weather. The overall market was stable with a hint of weakness.</p>
<p>South Shanghai: Yesterday, goods from various groups arrived in succession. Sales on this street remained stagnant. White glutinous rice from the northwest was sluggish because the sales yards in various places were quiet, and the atmosphere was weak. Fortunately, the cloudy weather prevented further price drops. Early indica rice in the south was in light demand, with ample arrivals and firm prices. Secondary grades were weak, only around 9.5 yuan. Yangdu indica was rarely transacted, and the market was quiet with no ups or downs. White raw rice was stagnant, but the market was stable because the inventory was not thick.</p>
<h3 id="e172">FLOUR MARKET IS EXTREMELY CHAOTIC <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Covering Short Positions Recently, Leading to a Sudden Surge</p>
<p>For Distant Futures, Margin Calls Led to Large-Scale Selling</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market fluctuated up and down. Due to different goals and changing circumstances, some initially fell and then rose, while others rose and then fell. When prices opened in the morning, because foreign wheat quotations fell by 3-4 jiao, the mood was extremely chaotic. The lowest price for this month was 2 liang, and distant futures were all down 2 fen from the previous weekend. Later, this month began to recover, but distant futures remained sluggish. When the market opened in the afternoon, this month, because the short positions that had not been covered on the last day had to be covered, and because Fufeng Factory was taking back its positions, the price suddenly surged at the last moment, reaching a high of 2 liang and 4 fen. April also rose as a result. Most of the distant months were subject to margin calls. Customers who were unable to continue to deliver had to sell at a loss, resulting in a weak market. As a result, this month rose by 2.5 fen from the previous weekend, April by 5 li, May fell by 1.25 fen, June fell by 1.75 fen, July fell by 2.5 fen, and August fell by 1.5 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e173">THE REVIVAL OF THE WHEAT MARKET AWAITS <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market was somewhat bleak because foreign wheat quotations fell by 3-4 jiao. However, many believed that the outcome in March was good, so if the arrival of foreign wheat eventually ceased, the pressure from short sellers might be slightly reduced. Therefore, there was still some calm amidst the boredom. Otherwise, the continuous decline in the flour market would also have a huge impact on the wheat market. However, rumors spread that a certain factory had ordered 3-4 more ships of foreign wheat at a price of only 3.8 taels, so the revival of the wheat market still awaits. As a result, this month fell by 4 fen, May and June fell by 2 fen, July fell by 1 fen, and August fell by 3 fen from the previous weekend.</p>

<p>Yesterday, there was still no turnaround for guest indica rice. However, southern groups were slightly active, and the market showed some vitality amidst the stagnation. However, there was not much inventory, and high-quality goods were scarce. Guest groups had no choice, and there was no major change in prices. The overall market saw 200 bags of Jiangxi machine-milled early rice purchased by the Fuzhou group at a price of 11.8 yuan. There were no other transactions.</p>
<h3 id="e175">WOOLEN CLOTH AND TRIBUTE CLOTH CHANGED PRICES SEVERAL TIMES IN ONE DAY <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>The woolen cloth market continued to improve yesterday, with exceptionally smooth actual sales. Because cloth prices had turned from falling to rising, those who had been waiting and watching were now actively purchasing. In addition, this street took the opportunity to search for goods, and the number of those who pawned silver and transferred it to the station increased significantly in preparation for selling it in the autumn. As a result, tribute cloth and Zhongshan cloth rose sharply. Among the groups, the Qingdao group had the strongest demand. There were signs that the "Wild Goose" tribute cloth had been completely bought up. The price changed several times a day. In the morning, it was still selling for 3 qian and 5 fen, but in the afternoon, it reached around 3 qian and 6 fen.
