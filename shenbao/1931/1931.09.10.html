<h3 id="c18">敬告中小學敎師 <a href="#c18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>此次國内慘重的水災。與外交上嚴重的情勢。實爲我民族生存能力的一塲大考試。也就是我國數十年來敎育成效的一次大檢閱。假如過去敎育確有成效。國民智識程度高。民族自具有充分的生存能力。天災之作。外侮之來。即不能防制於事先。當可應付裕如於事後。然而目前事實如何呢。洪水一來。國人惟有待死。外患一至。朝野惟有惶急。莫知所措。民族之無能。至此已完全暴露我們不能不沉痛地自承。我們底智識程度實在太低落了。我們過去底敎育已整個失敗了。</p>
<p>（往事之不忘即後事之師法。）過去的敎育是已經失敗了。今後怎樣辦呢。關於大學敎育我們在本月七日時評中。曾貢獻一些意見。今請更以無限熱望之忱。和中小學敎師作摰誠的討論。</p>
<p>近十餘年來。我國敎育上的最大缺點。即爲侈談主義。競尙歐化美化。而不注重實際的（應用）與實際的（做。）敎者留聲機似的呌。學者木偶似的學機械似的混過幾年。學者便算畢業。敎者便算了事。敎育與社會不求配合。學校所敎。社會不得其用。因之學生一離開死的學校。踏入活的社會。便茫然無所措手足。一無所能。大學如是。中學如是。即小學亦如是。敎育者儘管辦敎育。而智識依舊低落。人民依舊無知無能。敎育的成績。只是養成一些博士學士。政客官僚的候補者。充其量亦不過養成一般記定理背死書的書癡。如此敎育那能望其提高文明。那能望其養成健全的國民。那能望其推進我國家與民族臻於强盛繁榮之境域呢。</p>
<p>大學敎育我們已經說過了。中小學敎育爲一般普通國民敎育。爲敎育之初基。比大學敎育更爲重要。二十年後中國狀况如何。我們只須看現在的中小學生。以及敎中小學生的敎師。便可預斷。老實說。中小學敎師的手裏。實掌握着中華民族的命運。</p>
<p>我們認爲敎育應該是新的活的應用的。中小學生正是純潔的青年。天眞的孩提。應敎育成爲新時代新宇宙的創造者。不要敎育爲舊時代的承繼者。應時時引導其走上建設。生產改革之新軌。應趁其幼小。養成其創造的思想與精神。使其成爲未來時代開闢新宇宙的一個嶄新工人。</p>
<p>我們認爲新時代的敎師。應具有三種條件。一是科學的頭腦。二是勞動的身手。三是改造社會的精神。腦手並用。踐實奮鬭。敎育與社會才能打成一片。健全國民才能養成。即如此次萬案與韓案我們與其徒向學生高唱雪恥。不如敎學生知道日本。知道東北。知道日本爲什麽要侵略東北。知道人口繁殖是禍亂的根源。又如此次水災。我們敎學生寫一篇（大水記）。或是（乞賑文。）不如敎學生知道水災的根因預防和救濟的方法。以及造林。治水。築堤的重要意義。同時并訓練其同情心。敎其實際幹捐募助賑的工作。總之社會即是學校。社會一切活動。即是活潑潑的敎材。只有留聲機才唱念刻版的歌曲。只有機械才操做刻版的工作。那是舊的死的敎育的典型。新的活的敎育應該從（做）上敎從（做）上學。但求踐實不尙空談。但求應用。不尙虚名。</p>
<p>這次大檢閱。已充分地暴露了舊敎育之無能。我們應該覺悟了過去的錯誤罷。目前已到了國家民族存亡絕績的關鍵。敎育應該從新做起。應該重新安立國家的新根基。如果敎師們還是因循守舊。苟且偷安。把純潔的青年。活潑的小孩。敎成無用的遊民。與記定理的書癡。民族前途。將成絕望。是即辜負國家付托之重。亦即爲新時代無可逃逭的罪人。</p>
<p>（漫天撒下萌芽種。佇看他日結果時。）你兩手把握着種子的農夫。小心地慇懃地載播載種罷。中華民族的生命是在你們的手裏啊。</p>

<p>濟南通信、山東黄河、自上月下旬水勢一再退落、已暫告平靖、不國上游陜州水勢又漲、建瓴而下、山東黄河遂又增漲、計三日陜州水漲二尺四寸、四日又漲一尺五寸、兩次所漲之水、現已流到山東中游、洛口昨日漲一尺一寸、今日（七日）又漲七寸、本年水位、最高漲至高出海面九丈三尺、最低落至八丈六尺三寸、今又續漲、水位又逹八丈九尺之程度、但陜州之東入黄河之支流洛河伊河、均未漲水、鄭州以東除長清王符河外、無再入黄河之支流、各支流旣均未漲水、不致增加黄河水量、陜州最後漲水、亦流過中游、水勢已不致再有大漲、惟伏水熱、力在上、秋水凉、力在下、淘刷堤根、秋水力量最猛、十五年李升屯决口時、時序已至九月二十日、可知雖屆秋凉、黄河仍不能遽抱樂觀、上游若再續續增漲、本省三游、恐亦難免再出險工也、（九月七日）</p>

<p>▲西北爬通在未出發前、民誼亦曾發表言論、謂去西北重在交通、故有通新疆與昔時左宗棠重新疆之比喻、在新疆與各方討論此等問題、亦咸以民誼之主張爲不謬、今由新疆東返、深覺新疆問題仍以交通爲首要、交通之事、重在利器、今之交通利器、惟有汽車汽船飛機飛艇、然此均不適用於沙漠之地、沙漠旣無鐵路、又無汽車路、故必於汽車汽船飛機飛艇之外、另創交通器具、故一聞有爬行汽車爲專行沙漠之利器、遂令人關心西北交通者得一良好之感想、不學躍躍欲試、誠以此種器具果能成功、則視爲中國西北一大問題之交通問題、即可由此得一解决、於國計民生所關甚大、器械之發明、爲人類與學術界之公共貢獻、初不問其發明者之爲中國人或外國人、故當法人欲宣傳其爬行汽車之能事、而吾人尤希望其爬行之成功、老實言之、民誼當時固未忘學術考察與黨務視察之使命、然考察視察爲時甚短、私意以爲如果能使爬行成功、交通旣便、西北即通、一次考察何如多次考察、少數人視察、何如多數人視察、現在所敢欣然奉告者、爬行汽車確爲通行沙漠之利器、中國西北交通、必因有此利器而開一新紀元、故以此次中法合作言爲失敗、而以開發新疆試用爬行汽車言、則不得不謂爲成功、以法方遇許多波折、不能如期東西兩隊會合言爲失敗、而以華方之學術考察與黨務視察言、則不得不謂爲成功、故民誼一見西北交通之可以解决、一見新疆之可望開發、涉想前途、不覺有無窮之希望與愉快、於是個人體魄上所受之辛苦忘之矣、因函電遲誤、而致一時之誤會、亦忘之矣、途中有人故意挑撥、不但使中法兩團之間、感情不睦、由懷疑而生惡感、由惡感而起口角、由口角而甚至鬭毆、即中國團員間亦復如是、郝君之被毆、卜安之揮拳、亦不過爲此種離間挑撥者之傀儡、民誼覩此、精神上雖亦時感不快、然其事亦必有水落石出之一日、此種痛苦、亦因西北可以爬通、新疆可望開發之一念而忘之、</p>
<p>▲交通路線西北交通有三大幹路、民誼之愚、以爲政府亟應注意、於最短期内、完成此三大幹路、否則無論西北交通與新疆之開發無望、即蒙古新疆、勢亦難免不入外國版圖、此三大幹路、（一）由歸綏經蒙古沙地直逹古城子、即現在所經之駱駝大道、須時七十日、（二）即從前之大道、由北平經十八站、（每站即一日行站、以日計即十八日、）至西安、又十八站至蘭州、又十八站至肅州、又十八站至哈密、又十八站至迪化、共九十日始逹、北平至西安已通一半火車、一半汽車、約四日、西安至蘭州已通汽車、約四五日、哈密至迪化亦已通行汽車、約四五日、如加修由蘭州至肅州、自肅州至哈密之一段之汽車路、則蘭州至肅州約四五日、肅州至哈密約四五日、合計之汽車一通、則從前九十日之行程、可縮至二十一二日即逹矣、（三）即從前所稱之陽關大道、南通新疆和闐于闐而至哈斯者、此不過舉其路線之大略言之如是、至發展交通、開發西北之詳細計劃、當貢愚見、另行詳論、</p>

<p>（三續）</p>
<p>（九）蘇維埃區中央局向中央委員會報告書、（四月十九日）</p>
<p>中央委員會鑒、關於我等近日作戰情形、所可報告者、約有以下數端、</p>
<p>項英（譯音）勃林斯基柯莫納耳諸同志、以及短波電報通電員三人、皆已先後抵此、項英抵此之時、爲一月十一號、旋於十五號正式組織中央局、至中央革命軍事委員會亦已成立多日、該會之主席即係項英、而以朱德毛澤東兩同志代理各項事務、</p>
<p>蘇維埃區中央局之份子、除原經中央委員會委派者外、復由最近舉行之擴大會選出朱德鄭炳鈞陳逸祝一里彭德懷與林彪等爲該局委員、關於此點、尙祈予以追認、</p>
<p>此次擴大會對於四次大會之各項决議案、曾加以詳細之討論、結果一致同意各該項决議、以及中央委員會對右派反叛份子所採取之處置方法、</p>
<p>福建事件之眞相、近已完全暴露、關於該事件經各種證明、實係ＡＢ聨盟之一種反叛運動、前敵委員會對該事件之處置、至爲妥當、惟該團體迄今尙未切實整理、故仍爲目前之一嚴重問題、</p>
<p>目前敵軍尙未與我方主力接觸、僅逐步向我等進逼而已、我等已决先擊破其先頭部隊之一部、然後績定策略、聞紅軍第七軍及第二十軍在贛西已迭獲勝利、現在攻擊泰和、惟尙未接得確報、</p>
<p>此地切需指導人員、務請再酌派若干、以資應用、出發在即、僅作簡單報告如上、蘇維埃區中央局、四月十九日、</p>
<p>（三十）羅（譯音）轉託甘納地所呈之報告全國勞工大會已决於本週内成立鋼鐵委員會、關於領導該會之責任、應由香港方面同志負担、及ＣＣ份子對是項擬議之不滿、前次報告已經述及是項問題、當連同ＰＢ解决也、上海兵工廠内、我等原有紅色職工組織、故上項聨絡機關自可成立、山西河南及滿洲各地、亦有黨團活動上海江南造船廠及香港鋼鐵工人、亦有連絡、（三二）太平洋職工聨合會秘書處致全國勞工會書、</p>
<p>全國勞工會諸同志鑒、貴會諸同志所擬在蘇維埃直轄各區内本會之工作計劃、本會收到後業已詳細察閱、大致尙屬無謬、然有數點、必須認清者、</p>
<p>一·爲農業工人之問題、即如何將彼等組織而成爲普通職工聨合會、及彼等與貧苦農民、尤其是與貧苦農團之關係如何是也、論此問題之要素、有顯然可見而毫無疑義者、即此項農業工人務必立即加以組織、而使成爲一般的職工聨合會、一如從事於其他實業之工人、蓋農業工人之聨合會、足爲吾人最利之工具、此會旣成、由吾人之指使、便可藉以收服貧苦農民之心、得到均田革命之益、是故在農業工人與苦力小工及貧苦農民之間、必須有極近之接觸、最密之關係、如是則農業工人、得其他手藝小民之助、必能盡其領導之責、然論農業工人與貧苦農民兩種團體間組織上之關係究竟如何、似乎仍欠明瞭、貴會所擬之計畫中、第四節乙項有云（中等農民須與貧苦農團聨合、而農業工人聨合會可即加入各貧苦農團、盡其領導之責以搆成聨合陣綫）、於此吾人應更明白言之、夫任何一村之農業工人、當與他項職業之工人同樣組織、各自成其聨合會、如在一村當組織一農業工人之區分會、而該村之貧苦農民、則當另自組成一貧苦農團、農業工人爲農民階級中最能自知甘苦之人、再加以職工聨合會爲較有經騐的平民分子之助、彼等當可主動一切、於貧苦農團中組織等事盡責領導、但此等農業工人、雖組織成團、或爲一村之區分會、而並非加入貧苦農團而爲其團員也、彼等與貧苦農民當時常聨合舉行常會、並開聨席會議、而於會議時、此等團體常各自派其代表、一如同會之兄弟、又農業工人與貧苦農民反對地主·放債盤利者·國民黨·以及其他之軍閥、以求均田革命之売全勝利、兩者得切身之利益俱同、惟耕作工人團體須得維持發展而使成爲一般的職工聨合會、與現在蘇維埃直轄各區之革命職工聨合會及全國勞工會聨成一氣、而受其指揮與節制而貧苦農民團體則並非獨立之組織、彼等成立在一村以内、而其執行職務、亦當聽命於該村之蘇維埃執政者、蓋彼等應盡之職分、不過輔助蘇維埃執政者以實行均田革命、而與古剌克（富農）之勢力奮鬥、此所以耕作工人皆必參加貧農團體之工作、而農業工人之聨合會於此重要之活動、須盡其指導之責也、此外則苦力之輩及手藝工人、亦得實行參加、因此吾等提議、上述各項、均須挿入草案中、以免對於農村農業工人聨合會之整理、與農業工人聨合會之併呑貧農團體之意義、有所誤解、草案同一節中、尙有（吾等必須堅决反對立即採用集團耕此種集團化之嘗試、全係農民發起、出於農民之自願、而絕無外界之迫力）、農民爲利用充分之財產起見、自願組織集團、此種情形、亦間或有之、若遇此種情形時、吾等不禁止或阻止、草案同一節中又論及兩類之農民、與農業工人聨合會之兩種形式、（一）農業工人聨合會、（二）短工聨合會、（短工聨合會之組織、暫時置於農工人聨合會指導之下）、吾等提議、草案中分設兩種不同之組織、實易引起糾紛、故一項必須删去、一村一縣祇須設立一農業工人聨合會、其短工農人即可以入該會之短工部、凡担任經常工作、或短期工作、或偶然之工作、或僅於每年某一季節担任工作者、均可視爲農業工人、而加入農業工人聨合會之短工部、凡經農民革命後曾得一方土地、而在某種時節、仍爲土地工人者、均可歸入此類、有人以爲土地分配後已無農業工人、故亦無農業工人聨合會之必要、對於此種謬論、吾等必須竭力攻擊、</p>
<p>二、草案中關於（工人階級爭鬥之有系統的發展與領導）一節、大致無誤、但吾等尙有一提議、即汝等爲赴蘇維埃區域工作同志所擬定之任何指令、必須將勞工法草案關於罷工權之第八條挿入人、或全部録人其中（在蘇維埃法律之下、職工會均有行動之自由、組織之權、發表宣立交涉談判以及訂立條約之權、）吾等必須聲明組織并領導工人之爭鬥、以期實行勞工法之條例、</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>而在勞工法未實施前、亦即實行吾等草案中所詳述之原則、）此不僅爲蘇維埃區域内我階級職工會之權利、亦即其應有之責任也、國家企業與私人企業之區别、對於罷工一事甚爲重要、允因在階級爭鬥現階叚之國家企業、均係對於紅軍以及蘇維埃政府之防衛、有急迫之需要者也、但此亦並非吾等於國家企業中禁止罷工之謂、勞工法之基本條例、如八小時工作、最少工資等項、均須於國家企業中嚴格遵行之、若紅軍與蘇維埃區域之軍情有集中力量以供給軍械與糧餉之需要時、工人可在職工會領導之下、自動額外增加工作時間、以保障蘇維埃政府之安全、但此種行動、不可採取蘇維埃命令之形式、而禁止罷工一事亦然、此乃職工會最重要之宣傳工作與組織工作也、</p>
<p>三、第六節關於蘇維埃區域之組織工作、吾等亦有一提議、即職工會須有眞正無產階級的領導人員之必要、須加以特别注重、此項領導人員、</p>
<p>須由工人自己於工人階級中選出、以期確保蘇維埃政府與紅軍之安全、關於職工會内部日常生活與活動之一節、據吾等之意、尙須挿入一叚、即關於常會及會員資格審查會之問題、以及會員自願繳付之會費問題是也、但會費須按期繳付、俾職工會之經費有所保障、</p>
<p>四、第十節關於職工會對於蘇維埃機關之關係、據吾等之意、尙須挿入一叚、即關於我職工會對於城市及鄕村蘇維埃之工作者、職工會會員應踴躍參加地方蘇維埃選舉、俾蘇維埃區域内最富於無產階級意識之工廠工人·手工業者·以及農業工人、能與貧苦農民携手合作、（勞工委員會）與（勞工檢查員）均須由職工會直接介紹與委派、此外如社會保險與勞工保障合作社等團體、其人員亦須由職工會直接委派、關於生產節制之一節、私人企業生產如何節制、應加以說明、由工人選出而受職工會直接指導之勞工管理委員會、首先須注意、務使勞工法之條例見諸實行、而勿使雇主或其代理人進行任何破壞工作、或反革命行動、使私人企業之工人對於擁護紅軍與蘇維埃有適當之準備、此等委員會、亦應予以檢查該私人企業營業賬簿之權利、以期實行勞工法之條例、國家企業中工人之節制與管理、與上述私人企業中工人節制委員會之特殊職能、截然不同、吾等應加以區别、</p>
<p>五、第九節關於失業問題、尙有一點、須加以特别注意者、即蘇維埃政府目前正與敵人作生死之爭鬥、而此種爭鬥、决非短期内所能成功、故關於對付大衆失業之工作、非目前蘇維埃政府所能担任者、不應加諸其身、將失業工人中之最良份子募入紅軍、由勞工法規定之社會保險機關給予失業救濟、（此事一時尙難實行）籌備失業工人基金、由職工會管理、凡此種均係目前之主要計劃、</p>
<p>六、草案中關於將所有運輸工人如船夫車夫挑夫人力車夫等、組成一聨合會、自屬重要、但吾等須於水運陸運與鐵路運輸之間、加以區别、此三者目下均應分别組成各種工業聨合會、關於水運者、（包括海港工人）可合成一聨合會、鐵路工人可另成一鐵路工人聨合會、而其餘陸運工人、則又另成一聨合會、</p>
<p>七、婦女與青年之組織、須特别注重、其中有一重要之點、必須注意者、即婦女或青年不必獨立組織一聨合會、女工與男工均可加入同一聨合會、其義務與權利、亦與男工相同、十四歲以上之女工、亦須有組織、亦可加入職工會、且具有同等權利、青年部可設於職工會中、而受職工會之直接管理與指導、</p>
<p>八、煽動工作一節中、應挿入下列數項、傳播太平洋職工聨合會秘書處之活動計劃、打破地方感情與隔絕觀念、國際休戚關係問題、其他殖民地半殖民地國家以及帝國主義國家工人之爭鬥問題、指出按時向太平洋職工聨合會秘書處報告、並與其聨絡之必要太平洋職工聨合會秘書處（未完）</p>

<p>昨晚三六比三零勝滬江丨</p>
<p>曁南延長時間勝軍校</p>
<p>五十五與五十二之比</p>
<p>青光籃球隊昨晚於第二幕賑災籃球賽中、以三十六比三十、擊敗强有力之滬江隊、分數接近、表演精彩、尤以青光於下半時中、尤令人稱賞、第一場曁南於延長時間中、以五十五比五十二勝軍官學校、</p>
<h3 id="c109">曁南勝軍校 <a href="#c109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>軍校上半時表演甚佳、二十六比十七勝曁南、下半時四十二比三十一後、曁南漸漸追上、終結四十四平手、延長十分鐘、先五分鐘、曁南五十比四十六勝、軍校加四分又成平手、空氣緊張、曁南終以五十五比五十二獲勝、裁判員瞿鴻仁、</p>
<h3 id="c110">青光勝滬江 <a href="#c110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>青光滬江之戰、繼之而起、二隊在市運會中希望甚高、昨晚青光入後、愈戰愈佳、終以三十六比三十得勝、不可謂得意傑作、裁判員邵驥、</p>
<p>▲戰情之緊張二隊分數、相差每在二三分之間、接近非常、初滬江五少年虎將、一鼓下七分、十分鐘中、青光追成七比九、滬江乃以大學隊出職、青光造十四比十四之平比數、上半時滬江十六四勝二分、下半時滬江少年軍再入、僅留陸鍾恩、青光加入陸大振、就此轉機、數次平手、各二十六後、青光從此超出、一帆風順、三十六比三十勝、</p>
<p>▲青光之威風談逹鏵不滅威風、精彩時見、個人技藝、不可多得、而後衛張錦祥之攻守、昨晚實爲功臣、徐克培擲籃稍欠把握、陸大振之加入、爲青光轉機之大因、</p>
<p>▲滬江三易將滬江先以中學隊戰十分鐘、乃以大學隊畢上半時、下半時中學隊再出、留一陸鍾恩、中學軍之三鋒、敏速無比擲射尤有妙手、大學隊之前鋒、毫無能力、調易過冬、敗因之一、然入後三少年精力漸漸不濟於是落後、亦爲顯著失敗、論表演自不弱也、</p>

<p>其尊翁林樹棻君來函申述</p>
<p>林君原意鼓勵後進少年</p>
<p>劉君之說可作他日參考</p>
<p>本報自披露（劉鏗君對林寳華君談中華網球前十傑名次之商榷）以來、網球界同人、極爲注意、編者昨接林寳華尊翁林樹棻君來函、申述林寳華君并未有自誇第一之說、且其所談焦點、係趨重近日名手技術之進步如何、有鼓勵後進之誠意、絕無好惡之心在内云云、查中華全國體育協進會在本年全運會舉行之前、將有邀請國内外好手會聚上海作表演之舉、彼時前十傑之名次、或可正式產生、至劉鏗君發表意見、係對林君商權前十傑之名次而來、林君旣非欲編成十大傑、則劉君之說、可留爲他日作參考可也、茲附其尊翁林樹棻原函於後、</p>
<p>申報體育主筆先生大鑒、逕啟者、閱昨日貴報劉鏗先生對寳華與時報記者、會談中國能手一事、弟亦在坐、無愛惡之心、自知太陽雖好、紅不多時、實欲鼓舞英俊少年、俾於第十届遠運、恢復中國綱球名譽、並非侮慢、劉江兩君及其能手、垂望仁俠精神之國手、切勿悔吝犧牲一點、藉資褒揚後進者之熱心與興趣、</p>
<p>（二）與時報記者會談時、寳華自己之名未有加入談論、何指以降抑他人、實欲揣測國内貼近之有希望少年、將來機會代表中國耳、其餘在商華與國外者則不得而知、此非欲編成十大傑也、大抵本埠與各處嗜好網球者亦不小、假如與雨留客夜談近日名手技術之進步如何、亦非生愛惡之心、且寳華并未有自誇第一、則若劉先生設身處地、豈亦喊口不言乎、</p>
<p>（三）江君藝術興經騐、在國屢建大功、爲人人所稱讚、若置之於鄭君等級之下、弟亦駭異、但鄭君近日球藝進步、英不悚然、諒先生亦得聞兆佳君於蘆山牯　戰敗加拿大台杯選手Ｍr.Duff乎、諒私人談論、亦有受責哉、弟林樹棻上言、</p>

<p>自由談不除庭艸齋夫談薈如是我見　　到日本去的人總想知道一些關於天皇的故事。我也有這種好奇心。我的一個問題是現代日本人對於天皇的態度怎樣？比從前有什麽不同？　　我在東京，大橋圖書館裏看見一本書，書名爲天皇與普羅列搭里亞特，覺得非常奇怪。細看書的内容知道著書人的宗旨在謀天皇與勞働民衆之結合以推翻立在中間之貲產階級。這是一種異想天開之策略。据宫琦龍介說這派的人很多。無產黨人則說勞働者决不受這種學說之洪騙。總之，這派人是站在天皇的立塲上拉攏工人。我在這書裏發見一個藍墨水寫的眉批：　　（每年收入二千萬，眼看着一百五十萬失業者之凍餒無依、還是今天菊花宴明天櫻花會、樂得不歇的人與勞働民衆如何聨得起來！）　　這個眉批出於何人手筆不得而知。諒想或者是一個學生寫的。　　今年一月十六日我上桃山謁明治陵。我在山上的時候，日本人陸續來謁陵的也有十五人，内中有農人，鄕下老太太，小孩子，在鄕軍人，和一個工人。我站在那兒留心看他們的舉止。個個人來的時候都恭恭敬敬的跪在陵前祈禱，小孩子也跟着父母們照樣的幹，惟獨那位工人站在那兒不拜，望了一忽兒，就一個子下山了。四博士厄於俄  葉華女士　　四博士爲誰。醫學博士費昆年。法學博士楊琦。孫彭銜。工程學博士徐海毓是也。君等於今春自德法起程。道西比利亞返斾。途經蘇俄。備受困厄。爰撮費氏口述。以告國人。藉悉入俄經騐。　　▲哥哥行不得車行第三夜。逹莫斯科。憩息三時半。往赤塔。途中舉行查票。四博士護照終點爲海參崴。而車票則爲滿洲里。查票人認護照與車票不符。大發雷霆。阻止歸程。四人初未措思及此。至是相對黯然。探聽辦法。有謂電莫斯科。有謂折回。一籌莫展。正怏間。晤一波蘭老人。擬蒞哈爾濱經商。向查票員說項。遂於子夜在赤塔下車。商請站長。站長不見。玄冰雪地。躑躅異邦。　　▲博士忽失蹤是夜。遇暗探。人尙善。殷殷以辦理護照交涉自任。晨九時。暗探卸堂。約下午偕往護照處。正磋商間。忽徐博士失蹤。遍訪不得。羣疑有意外。歷半小時。徐欣然來。謂晤一山西同鄕。護照可懇其設法。三人喜出望外。乃聨袂趨謁。不謂同鄕係一飯店收賬員。其寓污陋若（才虎灶）。地狹人稠。相顧咋舌。然舍此無下榻處。惟忍心耐性耳。膳則不及滬上人力車夫。鹹菜肉絲湯。視爲珍味。食具穢垢殘碎。下箸無從。但肌渴交迫。惟有强進之而已。　　▲一日復一日餐後。同鄕裝聾啞。不復提護照事。衆則焦灼甚。催促再三。始驅車出發。比至領護照處。已高朋滿座。鵠候良久。主管長官遲遲駕臨。詰問後。每人付三十五金。允午後四時取執照。護照旣頒。第二步手續即購車中睡位票。赤塔快車一日一班。慢車間日一次。是日已錯過。仍留居同鄕家。留此倐二日。歸心如箭。入夜。四人睡一舖。擁擠萬分。晨起。天寒温水水。小面盆一。盛水半盆。四人洗臉嗽口。盡在於此。水濁又如泥漿。生活之苦。莫此爲甚。　　▲死作共產鬼　山西同鄕所居。來往多僑胞。均爲患難交。據云。前歲中東路交涉决裂。中俄烽火彌漫。留俄華人。多被拉夫拘捕。充小工。日工作十餘時。櫛風沐雨。苦不勝言。日飯一餐。終日飢饉。又往往受轉撻。傷重而死亡者。數見不一見。顚沛流離。雞犬不如。欲歸須納重捐。捐額無定。終致無力出資。歸計作罷。鳴呼相去千里。人絕路殊。生爲異域之奴。死作共產之鬼。哀哉。　　▲焦急兮流涙　護照旣頒。乃再到站購臥票。站員謂車到後。始可定奪。如是者三次。最後往前接洽。但見三人。亦以是被拒。博士等焦急異常。蓋護照越宿作廢。勢將轉徙他鄕。每念及此。徬徨無所措。費博士自告奮勇。更作一度之交涉。會此時站員援班。易一女性。晤後。略叩來歷。始知上午曾有接洽。遂將留下絕無僅有之臥位票出售。四博士乃手舞足蹈。皆大歡喜。一淂之言　　市衢間觸目俱醫生招牌。此病夫國之特徵也。　　▲羣鬼揶揄。尙可耐受。室人交謫。最爲難堪。　　▲胸中積得不少　勃氣。眶中貯有幾許辛酸涙。宇宙雖寛。奈無發洩之地何。　　▲書供人藏。不如供人讀。　　▲古人以讀墳典爲博學。今人以翻辭源爲多才。　　▲人能以愛妻拏之心愛國。則國無有不强。　　▲秋宵聽蟲吟。春暮看花落。同一傷感之事。　　▲情塲從不容納多人。故乘興而往者。大都失意而還。　　▲破壞易。建設難。故無建設之才者。幸弗空談破壞。　　▲作書畫。作文字。須俟靈機躍躍於胸時、動筆爲之。則趣韻神味俱全。若一勉强。便入惡道。（逸梅）上海小姐訪問記（上）  墨逸　　前夕明園舉行萬國浴美競艶大會。轟動海上。最後决賽。俄國海倫女士當選爲上海小姐。其詳細情形。已載各報。頃讀大陸報。刋有該報記者訪問彼姝之談話。關於女士之生活·擇偶·品性·諸點。誌之甚詳。　譯如左。以嚮讀者。　　▲不喜當家郎　肌膚微帶椶色的海倫女士說。（啊。我對於金錢可以没有。名譽也很淡薄。但愛在我的生命中却是一件最寳貴的東西。）記者便問伊。（你心目中的愛人是怎樣的一種人呢。）海倫想了片刻說。（他一定是一個身高·年青·而有椶色眼睛·椶色頭髮的人。我才能愛他。）（你願意他富有麽。）（不。我不願意他富有。我是不希罕金錢的。）伊帶着恨金他富有。骨的樣子說。（我願意他在世界上永久是一個窮小子。這樣我便更愛他。）（現在你有愛人麽。）（現在還没有。不過在某時候我却希望愛情悄悄的潛入我心中。我希望在年青的時候結婚。我今年十七歲。很快了。十二月二十三日我就十八歲了。我以爲一個女孩子到了十八歲不嫁還是很遲的了。對方我希望是一個二十七歲的青年。）　　▲擇偶很平凡　海倫不過是一個十七歲的女孩子。伊便以伊的意志决定了伊擇偶的條件。並不像其他的女子。自己以爲是怎樣的美麗。而擇偶甚苛。有非得是某種模型的男子不嫁的奢望。海倫擇偶的條件的平凡。更可以證明伊的聰慧和伊的美麗一樣的惹人憐愛了。伊也有許多的幻想·奢望·和企求如在同樣地位的女子一般。伊的父母給蘇維埃政府驅逐後。便由富翁一變而爲窮漢。近兩年來他們的足跡踏遍了遠東各大埠。海倫在小孩子的時候。便跟着父母過着漂泊的生活。伊一九一三年生於Petuogrado八歲便到哈爾濱。兩年前才和伊父母來到上海。伊說伊很愛上海。並且想到美國去一趟。記者問（假使你嫁給一個窮小子。而他無力使你逹到到美國去的希望。你將怎樣呢）。海倫想了半天說。（那麽。我不去了。上海不是也很可愛麽。）海倫重一百零三鎊。身五呎四吋。伊說伊對於皮膚是很愛護的。只用一種肥皂和同樣温度的水。所以伊的皮膚異常的細膩。扶桑雜記  艾艾自東京寄　　日本的當店　　日本近來國民間的經濟狀况。是漸漸地低落了。因爲財富的集中。大多數的市民是一天天的貧窮化。大學畢業生。感到麵包的飢荒。勞働者失業的數字。有增無减。從前小康之家。可以安安穩穩地過日子的。現在因爲客觀的或主觀的種種原因。都相繼破產。中落。甚至發生生活的恐怖。　　貧窮的洪水。是到處都在泛濫。在這百業蕭條的社會。祗有典當店的生意。是利市三倍。祇有典當店的數量。是增加了。這是必然的。正如同我國的女子初次剪髮的時候一樣。街頭巷尾。添設了無數的理髮店。完全是因着社會的需要。而產生的。　　藍黑色的門簾。印着鮮明的白字。這是日本當店獨有的裝飾。門簾的妙用。不减於我國當店的屏風。他們的營業都十分興旺。在以前不過是無產階級者唯一的通融救急的機關。現在呢。就是中上人家。亦往往出入其門。依爲緩急之助。日本當店的老　。却並不像我們中國當店的老　。呆呆地坐在櫃檯上。等待機會的到來。他們也和其他的商店一樣。到處分傳單。貼廣告。　　（諸君。我們誠懇地忠實地介紹一個願爲先生服務的店舖。敝店裝設有防禦地·震防禦盜賊·防禦水火災變的最新式的安全保險箱。代各界諸君保藏珠寳鑽石以及一切有價值的合同·股票·憑單。　　敝店可以負責保證。寄存敝店的一應衣帽裙衫。决不至有鼠嚙蟲傷。當我們將一件禮服或一套洋服。奉還給我們的顧主時。我們常常使這些物件。平直得如同由洗衣作或裁縫店取出的一樣。這是許多顧主所一致贊許的。敝店深謝故界的好評。而將更謹愼於我們的業務。我們是代各界保管着一切的物件。比保管自己的所有物更當心。　　我們是薄利主義者。我們隨時都在歡迎諸君。各界如有所委託時。無論親自降臨。或來函示知。或打電話。敝店當即派人趨前接洽。）　　大規模的當店。是常常聘着大學畢業生爲店員。因爲他們需要懂得外國文。學生們是常常拿着厚的英德文原本書質錢。要是他們對於一本書的著述者之名望。出版的年月。再版的次數。書的内容。以及在社會間一般的價值。没有研究。他們是無從應付的。　　據典當業領袖竹村秀太郎與都新聞（報名）記者的談話。去年典當中所收到的物件。超過昭和四年二倍以上。質量方面。更有顯然的向上。去年所收到的寳石珠玉珊瑚瑪瑙甚多。間有一大部份並非平民所能有。可見逹官貴人中。實不乏經濟拮据者。有一次有一摩登少年。駕一馬托卡當五百元。當店方面因無處安放。臨時租一汽車間。但不到半月。少年便把車贖了回去。而且慷慨地付了一個月的租金。學生們每逢寒暑假回到故鄕去的時候。常將其全部行李書籍送進當店。迨開學來時。方備欵取贖。去年質當大學卒業證書者有十七人。此等生意。都是往年所未有的。且有一日一素負盛名的體育家。捧着很多的銀質獎品求質。可是那些獎品上。都刻着私人的姓名。萬一期滿不來取贖時。典當方面無從變買取償。所以婉言謝絕了。説部扶輪會丈夫的妻子（九）  江紅蕉　　陳夫人似乎很能幹，伊坐在李夫人床沿上，低低地和李夫人不知說了些什麽話，李夫人哭聲便止了。陳夫人又在熱水瓶裏傾了些熱水，擠了一把熱面巾給李夫人擦了臉。　　（李先生—蘭珍姊也許受了寒，還是給伊多蓋條棉被吧。時候不早了，大家早些睡吧！以後你如外面事忙，不能早歸，最好派人送一個字條子回來，免得伊盼望。）陳夫人向李先生說着，便暗示了伊的丈夫走了。　　李先生夫婦在這夜裏，不曾在床上講過一句話，因爲李夫人只會用不開口的消極方法，對付丈夫，李先生雖然也使用過假温存的方法，但是李夫人總給他個不理不睬。他們是睡着一隻床，蓋的一條被，但是各人的思想與意趣，都不一致，完全和不是夫婦一般。李夫人在意想將來的不幸，李先生在意想萬一事情弄僵了怎麽辦法。他並不拿剛才汽車裏的女人和他夫人相比，只拿陳夫人與他的妻子來比較。他眼裏看來，陳夫人的美麗，活潑，倜儻，大方，以及穿衣的身裁，談吐的雋雅，交際的周到，收拾屋子的乾淨，是蘭珍所一樣及不到的；還有陳夫人能跳舞，能彈琴，能打牌，能開汽車，蘭珍却一樣也不能。但是蘭珍的莊重，省儉，體恤丈夫，學問好，他一概抹煞，完全不曾想到。他自己忘了這件婚烟的成立，完全是自由變愛，當時他的心目中，蘭珍是天下第一個才美兼備而温柔的女子；現在他十分地厭倦，處處覺得陳夫人才是模範的妻子。他十分羡慕陳先生有艶福。　　在這夜，陳先生夫婦忽然地吵嘴了。在以前陳先生是没有一件事，不是以夫人的意志爲意志，所以從來不曾吵過嘴的。　　（你這人怎麽總是這樣傻氣，他們夫婦間的事，那裏容得第三人挿進去多嘴，你偏偏不識風雲起色去多嘴，以後你得注意，不要再做傻！）陳夫人像敎訓子女一般地訴說丈夫。</p>

<p>(Nanjing) It has been decided that the venue for the Fourth National Congress will still be the Central University Auditorium. Zhu Jiahua has ordered the general affairs section to tidy up and repair the surrounding lawns, flowers, and trees early. It is noted that the first congress was held in the Guangdong Central University Auditorium, the second in the Guangdong Provincial Assembly Auditorium, and the third in the Nanjing Military Academy Auditorium.

<p>(Nanjing) Huang Boyao, in the name of representing the American General Branch, earnestly requests the postponement of the Fourth National Congress, stating that with foreign aggression, natural disasters, and banditry pressing in, at this difficult time, the party should not split and cause endless disputes. If the Nanjing and Guangdong sides each go to extremes and hold separate congresses, the party's disputes will become even more intense, leading to self-destruction. He earnestly requests both sides to postpone the date of the Fourth National Congress until the party's disputes are resolved, and then set a new date for the congress. This would leave room for maneuver. Huang is currently in Beiping, possibly in contact with Zhang Ji. (Ninth-day special dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e13">Zhong Yu Discusses the Seriousness of the Nakamura Incident <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese Side Intends to Provoke Trouble</p>
<p>(Harbin) Zhong Yu told me that the Nakamura Captain missing case is now serious, even more so than the Wan case. The Japanese side intends to provoke trouble, so negotiations are becoming increasingly stringent. In May of this year, the Harbin consulate sent a passport for a merchant named Nakamura to travel in the three eastern provinces, requesting my visa. The missing person may be this person. However, in 1929, I sent a note to the Japanese side prohibiting foreigners from traveling to the Xing'an district, which is not inland of the three eastern provinces, and because the area is unstable. The original case is on file. Now, Nakamura is impersonating a merchant as a military officer. Whether he is missing or not is not my responsibility. As for how the negotiations will proceed, because it is not my responsibility, I am not very clear. (Ninth-day dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Zhong Yu returned to Harbin this morning, and I visited him. According to his account, after going to Jilin, he held three more rounds of talks on the Wan case. The Japanese side does not allow Koreans from Wanbaoshan to leave the country, saying that according to Article 21 of the 1915 Sino-Japanese Treaties and the Inada Contract, they have the right to reside there. They also insist that the illegally concluded Inada Contract is valid. The negotiations ultimately yielded no results. Japanese Consul Ishi says he will go to Liaoning to consult with Consul-General Lin and will continue the talks upon his return. I also specifically telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to request a copy of the Japanese side's three replies, which I have not yet seen. I will go to Jilin again in twenty days to continue the talks. (Ninth-day dispatch)</p>

<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Begins Drafting</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the Foreign Affairs Group Committee of the Political Council discussed the Wanbaoshan case on the eighth, it was decided that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should draft a secondary reply. There is much consideration being given to the wording of the reply. Because Zhong, the Northeast negotiator, has already directly negotiated, the progress of his negotiations has not yet been fully reported to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It has not yet been decided whether the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will base its reply on Zhong's negotiation sequence, or whether it will formulate a broad outline of refutation and instruct Zhong to negotiate the details.

<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Submits Revisions to the Italian Envoy</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the Sino-Italian Boxer Indemnity, the previous Beijing government and Italy signed an agreement on four uses: (1) building an iron bridge over the Cao'e River; (2) dredging the Huai River; (3) developing Haizhou City; (4) constructing various cities in Beiping. Now, due to changing circumstances, the Executive Yuan has ordered the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to propose revisions to Italy. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has submitted to the Italian envoy to China a method for transferring the uses, revising the first, third, and fourth points, and revising the original allocation method of dividing each use into four equal parts. It is also heard that the payment period for the Sino-Italian Boxer Indemnity agreement is extended by four years compared to other Boxer Indemnities, ending in 1949. According to the agreement, when China uses the returned indemnity to construct the specified projects, it may employ Italian engineers without purchasing Italian materials. It is heard that this point will also be proposed for revision to avoid restrictions. As for the limits of the Italian pledge, it is currently unknown, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is confident that Italy will be able to accept the amendment and facilitate consultations.

<h3 id="e18">A Respectful Message to Primary and Secondary School Teachers <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>The grievous floods and the grave diplomatic circumstances that our country now faces are in effect a great test of our national survival. They are also a great review of the educational achievements of the past several decades. If education in the past had truly been effective, and the level of national knowledge was high, then our people would possess adequate ability to survive. Even if such natural disasters and foreign aggressions could not be prevented in advance, they could be coped with comfortably after they occur. But how does the current reality stack up? When the flood comes, the people can only await death. When foreign aggression arrives, both the government and the people are only in a panic, at a loss for what to do. The incompetence of the nation has been completely exposed. We must admit with pain that our knowledge is truly too low. Our education of the past has been a complete failure.</p>
<p>(Forgetting past events is like making things up as you go.) The education of the past has already failed. What should we do from now on? Regarding university education, we have previously offered some opinions in the current affairs commentary on the 7th of this month. Now, we would like to have a sincere discussion with primary and secondary school teachers with limitless hopes.</p>
<p>In the past decade or so, the biggest shortcoming in our country's education has been the extravagant talk about ideologies and the competition to esteem Westernization, while neglecting the practical (application) and practical (doing). The teachers call out like gramophones, and the students mechanically muddle through a few years like wooden puppets. The students are then considered graduated, and the teachers consider the matter done. Education does not seek to coordinate with society, and what is taught in schools cannot be used by society. As a result, students, upon leaving the dead school and stepping into the living society, are at a loss for what to do and are completely unable to do anything. This is the case for universities, secondary schools, and even primary schools. Educators continue to run education, but knowledge remains low, and the people remain ignorant and incompetent. The achievements of education are only to cultivate some candidates for doctorates, bachelors, politicians, and bureaucrats. At best, it only cultivates a group of bookworms who memorize definitions and recite dead books. How can such education be expected to improve civilization? How can it be expected to cultivate sound citizens? How can it be expected to advance our country and nation towards strength, prosperity, and glory?</p>
<p>We have already spoken about university education. Primary and secondary education is the general education of ordinary citizens and the foundation of education, which is even more important than university education. What will China's situation be like in twenty years? We only need to look at the current primary and secondary school students, as well as the teachers who teach them, to predict it. To be honest, the fate of the Chinese nation is truly in the hands of primary and secondary school teachers.</p>
<p>We believe that education should be new, living, and applicable. Primary and secondary school students are precisely pure youths and innocent children. They should be educated to become creators of the new era and the new universe, not educated to be inheritors of the old era. They should be guided at all times onto the new track of construction, production, and reform. Their creative thoughts and spirit should be cultivated from a young age, so that they can become a brand-new worker who can open up a new universe in the future era.</p>
<p>We believe that teachers in the new era should possess three conditions: first, a scientific mind; second, industrious hands; and third, a spirit of transforming society. By using both the mind and the hands, and by fighting with all our might, education and society can be integrated, and healthy citizens can be cultivated. For example, in the Wan case and the Korean case, instead of simply singing about revenge to the students, we should teach the students about Japan, about the Northeast, about why Japan wants to invade the Northeast, and about how population growth is the root of disaster. Similarly, in this flood, instead of having students write an "Account of the Flood" or a "Begging for Relief" essay, we should teach the students about the root causes of the flood, the methods of prevention and relief, and the importance of afforestation, water management, and dike construction. At the same time, we should cultivate their compassion and have them actually engage in the work of donating and helping with relief. In short, society is the school, and all activities in society are lively teaching materials. Only gramophones recite stereotyped songs, and only machines perform stereotyped work. That is the epitome of old and dead education. New and living education should be taught and learned through (doing), seeking practicality over empty talk, and seeking application over empty fame.</p>
<p>This great review has fully exposed the incompetence of the old education. We should be aware of the mistakes of the past. We have now reached the crucial juncture of the survival of the nation and the race. Education should start anew and re-establish the new foundation of the country. If teachers continue to follow the old ways, taking a laissez-faire attitude, and turn pure youths and lively children into useless vagrants and bookworms who memorize definitions, the future of the nation will be hopeless. This is to fail the heavy responsibility entrusted by the country, and it is also to be an inescapable sinner of the new era.</p>
<p>(Seeds of sprouts are scattered across the sky; wait and see when they bear fruit one day.) Farmers, you hold the seeds in your hands; carefully and diligently sow and plant them. The life of the Chinese nation is in your hands.</p>

<p>(Taiyuan) The Jin Rehabilitation Association sent a letter to Yan, stating that a defeated general is not qualified to speak of bravery, and a leader of a fallen nation cannot plan for its survival. Seeking luck to gain merit is certainly futile. Last year, you rashly engaged in military actions, leading to defeat and retreat. When you left, you not only failed to offer a single word of apology to the world, nor did you offer comfort to the people of Jin, but you secretly requisitioned a large sum of money from the provincial treasury, causing a sharp decline in the provincial currency. How have the people of Jin wronged you that you would be so unbenevolent? Now, bandits are rampant, and the people either die from hunger or are slaughtered. Alas, the people of Jin have many ways to die but no way to live. Enduring hardships and pain, they have suffered for so long that even heaven and man pity them. Yet you suddenly arrive by plane. Xiang Yu lost eight thousand sons of Jiangdong and felt he had no face to see the elders of Jiangdong. How do you compare to Xiang Yu, having lost all the sons of Jin? You must know that today's Shanxi is not the same as it used to be. If you desire to live in peace, I fear that the people of Jin will not be able to live in peace. Therefore, we advise you not to contend against the tide, but to withdraw far away, and not to bring disaster upon the seventeen million people. (9th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Yesterday afternoon, Zhang Weihan, the Provincial Committee Member and Commissioner of Civil Affairs of Yunnan Province, reported to the National Government. When he returned to Room 336 of the Central Hotel, three men from the room opposite, claiming to be Committee Member Chen of the National Government, asked him to come over for a conversation. Zhang saw that he did not recognize the three men and was about to leave. The three men then drew guns, saying they were ordered to arrest him and would not let him leave. Zhang had no choice but to stay in the room and asked if they had any official documents. They replied that they had a telegram but refused to hand it over. Zhang explained that he was the Commissioner of Civil Affairs of Yunnan Province and had come to Beijing from Yunnan, passing through Hong Kong, which is why he had a Hong Kong hotel receipt. He had just returned from reporting to the National Government and did not know what he had done wrong. The three men realized their mistake and falsely claimed that the hotel clerk had given a false report. They left in silence.

<p>Mexico Agrees to Join the League</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Geneva, 8th. This afternoon, the League of Nations Council held a meeting. The British representative proposed a motion expressing the League of Nations Council's sympathy for the Chinese disaster victims. The motion was passed unanimously. The British representative, Cecil, suggested that the League of Nations Health Committee should assist China to meet its needs. This motion was also passed. Italian Foreign Minister Grandi proposed that all military preparations should be immediately halted pending the Disarmament Conference. This matter should not only be handled with courage and moderation, but also with good faith. If the member states of the League of Nations follow this, they will set a good example and create an atmosphere of trust. Furthermore, with lower military burdens, commercial tariff barriers will soon be lifted. The Council unanimously invited Mexico to join the League of Nations. The League of Nations received a report from the German government today on Germany's military preparations as of the end of June 1931, stating that the army had 100,500 soldiers and 4,500 officers, the navy had 15,000 soldiers and 1,500 officers, and there was no air force.

<p>The Prime Minister Elaborates on the Handling of the Crisis</p>
<p>▲[Reuters, London, 8th] Parliament reconvened today, and the nation's attention was focused here. Parliament adjourned at the end of July and was originally scheduled to reconvene on October 22nd. However, due to the government's proposals to reduce government spending and increase taxes in order to restore the nation's fiscal balance, which urgently needed to be passed and implemented, Parliament convened a special session today. Former Labour Party leader Prime Minister MacDonald appeared in the House of Commons today, allied with the leaders of the Conservative and Liberal parties, who had previously been in opposition. As for the Labour Party members who had previously supported MacDonald, they were all seated in the opposition seats, with only a dozen or so remaining loyal to their former leader. After the King's Speech was read, the Prime Minister moved that the House of Commons Committee on Finance be established on Thursday to receive Chancellor of the Exchequer Snowden's special supplementary budget. The Prime Minister then spoke, saying that the current emergency situation was an extraordinary event in politics and a test of democratic government. Democratic government often cannot save itself from sudden danger. It is gratifying to see how the people have united to deal with the emergency situation, he said. The Prime Minister continued to speak about the government's handling of the tense situation, saying that on August 8th, the Bank of England's gold reserves were threatened by a large number of withdrawals, indicating that a serious situation was about to occur. With the situation pressing, a temporary loan was secured to prevent a sharp decline in the pound. If no measures had been taken at that time, a real panic would have broken out, and the pound would not only have been slightly devalued but would have plummeted to zero. Subsequently, the storm continued unabated, and the government had to act quickly to consolidate its defenses. The situation was caused by various reasons from home and abroad. It should not be mistaken as due to a possible lack of public savings but was actually due to a wavering of confidence. Lack of confidence is extremely harmful, and our complex credit structure would be significantly affected. We were forced by the situation to borrow money, and borrowing must balance the budget and place unemployment finance on a solid financial foundation. Some say that the establishment of the National Government was based on external pressure from the international financial community. In reality, bankers and financiers, no matter how selfish, would not want to devise political methods to bankrupt themselves. He can declare unequivocally that all negotiations were conducted by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Prime Minister with the consent of the government. The banks never interfered in political proposals during the negotiations. They only stated their professional opinions and predicted the impact of political proposals on borrowing. He is willing to work with anyone who acknowledges that no external authority can control national politics (government supporters cheer). This principle applies not only to finance but also to any institution (referring to trade unions). The banks' contact with the government was always limited to their legitimate banking business, he said. The Prime Minister praised the goodwill expressed by American and French bankers and said that important negotiations on reparations and debt repayment would take place soon. Therefore, he hoped that the opposition would speak cautiously and not attack foreigners because of domestic affairs, he said. A Labour Party member shouted, "Is the Prime Minister himself affected by the spending cuts?" MacDonald replied, "I will take a cut of £1,000 per year myself." After the Prime Minister's speech, which lasted an hour, opposition leader Henderson rose and said that there were two types of cuts that the Labour Party could not accept: one was the expenditure on social programs, and the other was unemployment benefits. The entire previous Labour cabinet had agreed to save £56 million, but MacDonald and Snowden, after consulting with the leaders of the Conservative and Liberal parties, proposed to save another £30 million, most of which would have to come from the unemployed, he said. The current Home Secretary, Liberal Samuel, rose to vehemently deny Henderson's claims on behalf of the Conservative and Liberal parties. Henderson continued, saying that he had no criticism of the banks and that his trust in the relationship between Britain, France, and the United States led him to the conclusion that France and the United States would never dare to allow British credit to collapse for their own benefit, he said. The current Lord President of the Council, Baldwin, rose and said that the financial problem had become the most urgent matter. No matter how unpleasant the remedy, no one has the right to refuse it. Therefore, the Conservative Party has no other choice but to agree to give MacDonald the assistance it can. Until the government's work is completed, the Conservative Party will do its best to help. If the opposition's attitude causes other countries to misunderstand that a large part of the British people do not understand the seriousness of their position and are unwilling to deal with their current difficulties, then the opposition bears a heavy responsibility and must examine itself. If Britain's international credit collapses, there will be an unprecedented disaster, not only affecting Britain but also the entire human race, he said. Mosley, who had previously left the Labour Party to form a new party, stated his position today, saying that he hoped the government could achieve its goals, but he felt that the proposed plan was not sufficient. He advocated implementing a vigorous industrial policy and said that it would be useless to balance the budget based on existing revenues. Churchill, who had previously disagreed with Conservative Party leaders on Indian policy, said that all imported goods must be taxed, otherwise, it would be impossible to restore Britain's finances and industrial status. Churchill was originally a free trader, and his remarks surprised those who heard them. He probably wanted to cater to the psychology of the protectionists in the Conservative Party and hope to get their support in future political activities. After speeches from various sides, the assembly voted and passed the vote of confidence by 309 votes to 250. When the result was announced, there was a great cheer. The National Government's first day in the House of Commons ended in a victory. At the same time, there was also a discussion in the House of Lords, but the scope was smaller, and the number of opposition members was not large enough to resist the majority. After the Lord Chancellor read the King's Speech, the new Foreign Secretary, Sir Reading, spoke on behalf of the government, outlining the causes of the current financial crisis and the changes in the cabinet. He concluded by saying that the new government will resolutely strive to restore financial stability and is sure to get the support of the people. Opposition leader Passfield rose and said that the reduction of unemployment benefits was the most unsatisfactory thing. Therefore, the opposition completely distrusts the new government. Spending cuts are necessary, but the opposition believes that spending cuts should be implemented according to the ability to pay, he said. The House of Lords then adjourned until September 17th.</p>

<p>To the Shen Bao Newspaper Office in Nanjing, Upon reading your esteemed newspaper's report on the 8th regarding the Nanjing telegram on the 7th, which stated that Chairman Chiang summoned Acting President Shao to inquire about the situation in the Legislative Yuan, this is not factual. We hope you will make a correction. [Signed] Secretariat of the Legislative Yuan [seal]</p>

<p>Official Telegram Two</p>
<p>To all newspaper offices in Beiping, This year, the central and southern provinces have experienced unprecedented floods, a disaster of immense proportions rarely seen in ancient times. We have received numerous letters and telegrams from various parties, fully understanding the tragic situation. Our hearts ache for the disaster victims, and we are deeply concerned. It is only through the collective effort of all that we can provide relief. Therefore, we have established the "Flood Relief Association of Various Provinces" at our Deputy Commander's Headquarters, with branches in the governments of Hebei, Shanxi, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Jehol, Chahar, and Suiyuan provinces, the special municipalities of Harbin and Weihaiwei, and the municipal governments of Beiping, Tianjin, and Qingdao. Zhang Xueliang will serve concurrently as the president of the association, and the governors and mayors of each province and municipality will serve as vice presidents. We are organizing and establishing these associations immediately and will work diligently to solicit donations of money and grain and send them to the Central Flood Relief Committee for distribution to the disaster areas, hoping to make a small contribution and alleviate the disaster. With reconstruction needed and anxiety weighing heavily on us, we hereby report this situation for your consideration. [Signed] Zhang Xueliang [seal]</p>
<p>To all newspaper offices in Nanchang, Unfortunately, Jiangxi Province has been afflicted by both natural disasters and man-made calamities. The scourge of the communists has not been eliminated, and floods have been reported repeatedly. Since the beginning of summer, mountain torrents have erupted, turning houses into ruins and fields into nothingness. People and animals have been swept away, and death is widespread, turning many areas into marshes. This time, the Yangtze River flood has also affected northern Jiangxi, and transportation to Nanxun is still mostly obstructed. According to a survey conducted by our province's disaster relief commissioners, the flooded area covers more than 3,700 square miles, with losses estimated at more than 100 million yuan. The disaster area is vast, and the disaster is extraordinarily severe. Autumn is approaching, and we do not know how we will survive. Thinking of this, our anxiety deepens. We humbly request the officials of the party and government to quickly allocate funds for relief so that the dying people of Jiangxi can recover and flourish. We also appeal to all charitable people to act with compassion, providing aid to the hungry and drowning. Whether by donating generously or soliciting donations, the more the better, so that all disaster victims can benefit. Our association will express its gratitude on behalf of the people. With sadness in our telegram, we humbly beg for your understanding and consideration. [Signed] Jiangxi Provincial Association of All Trades</p>

<p>Shao Yuanchong Reports on the Significance and Lessons of the Uprising</p>
<p>The Central Party Headquarters held a memorial meeting for Dr. Sun Yat-sen's First Uprising at 8:00 AM on the 9th. Present were Chiang Kai-shek, Yu Youren, Ding Weifen, Shao Yuanchong, Zhu Peide, En Kemaguoguo, Fang Juehui, Zhang Renjie, Zeng Yangfu, Wu Jingheng, Wang Zhengting, Zhu Jiahua, Wang Boqun, Lu Dipin, Wang Bailing, Zhang Daofan, Chen Lifu, Yi Peiji, Niu Yongjian, and over 600 other staff and guests. After the opening ceremony led by Chairman Yu Youren, Shao Yuanchong reported on the significance and lessons of the First Uprising, stating that Dr. Sun Yat-sen's First Uprising was now thirty-seven years ago. After the Taiping Rebellion at the end of the Qing Dynasty, imperialism gradually exerted its political and economic aggression, and the country's situation became perilous. Dr. Sun Yat-sen knew that revolution was the only way to save the country. He opened hospitals and pharmacies in Guangdong and Hong Kong as revolutionary organs and used the Agricultural Society as a base for propaganda. There were contacts with the defense battalions and the navy. He decided to take advantage of the Double Ninth Festival by using tomb sweeping as a pretext to avoid the attention of the Manchus and launch the uprising. Unexpectedly, Zhu Qi revealed the secret to his brother, who, fearing the extermination of his family, informed the authorities. On the 9th, the Manchu government cracked down on several revolutionary organs. Dr. Sun Yat-sen had gone to Macau and then to Hong Kong. Zhu Gui, Quan Cheng, Kui Guang, and others were martyred. This was truly the beginning of the Three Principles of the People's revolutionary movement. After many uprisings, success was finally achieved. Therefore, its significance is very significant. In general, those who bear the responsibility of creation face very difficult circumstances. Those who are prescient and enlightened must have great courage to bear the responsibility of creation. Historically, the greatest thing is the creative enterprise. Dr. Sun Yat-sen had a far-sighted vision and judged that the situation in China at the end of the Qing Dynasty could not be saved without a revolution of ideology. Therefore, there was the great creation. The failure of the First Uprising was not because the strength was not equal to the Manchus but because Zhu Qi's brother informed the authorities, and it was first destroyed from within. Things must rot before worms appear. If an organization is not unified internally and is not tightly organized, it can never succeed. Today's China must rely on the Kuomintang to complete the responsibility of the revolution. However, it must not break down from within. Moreover, the severity of the national flood this time is unprecedented in history. Not only members of our party but also the entire nation should work together to bear the responsibility of saving the country from danger. The bandits are being gradually wiped out, and if there are no other forces to undermine us, they will certainly be wiped out in the shortest time. At the same time, international imperialists are exerting various severe pressures on us. Under these circumstances, we should abandon our prejudices and lead the nation as a whole, and anyone with a conscience should abandon their prejudices and work together with all party comrades and the people of the country to save the country and overcome the current difficulties, and so on. The meeting adjourned after Shao's report.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Guangdong and Guangxi Armies Invade Hunan Again <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Various Leaders Decide on a Plan to Deal with the Situation</p>
<p>Liu Jianxu Immediately Goes to Hengzhou to Deploy Defenses</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence, The rumors of the Guangdong and Guangxi armies invading Hunan have been circulating for a long time. In early August, Gui Jun's (Guangxi Army) Tan Lianfang's division crossed the Huangsha River and advanced to Fangzhu Village, 30 li from Yongzhou. Han Caifeng's unit arrived at Longhuguan, and part of Zhang Fakui's unit also arrived at Yongming. Yue Jun's (Guangdong Army) Li Yangjing's unit then attempted to spy on Xuanzhang from Pingshi. At that time, He Jian was deploying troops to deal with the situation when suddenly the Zhang armies of Guangdong and Guangxi simultaneously withdrew on their own initiative. In the past three or four days, there have been secondary rumors of the Guangdong and Guangxi armies invading Hunan. The authorities initially thought it was still a false alarm, so they did not pay much attention. Unexpectedly, according to reports from southern Hunan, the Guangdong and Guangxi armies are advancing north in three routes: (1) Yue Jun's Li Yangjing and Yu Hanmou units enter Hunan from Pingshi; (2) Gui Jun, led by Bai Chongxi, commands the 47th and 4th Armies and is scheduled to mobilize into Hunan on September 4th; (3) Zhang Fakui's unit enters Hunan from Longhuguan. At this time, He Jian had gone to various counties to inspect the disaster. Cao Dianqiu, the acting chairman of the provincial government, reported the situation at noon and immediately telegraphed He Jian, asking him to return to the province as soon as possible to plan military affairs. He also sent a telegram to Commander-in-Chief Chiang, asking him to quickly send more troops to Hunan to help defend the province. On the evening of the 2nd, a meeting was held with the provincial military and political leaders to discuss defense and dispatched the First Hunan Aviation Squadron to Heng on the morning of the 3rd to receive dispatch and assistance from Army Commander Liu and Division Commander Tao. After the discussion, Liu Jianxu left the province for Hengzhou on the 3rd. At 3:00 PM, he arrived safely in Hengzhou and sent a radio message reporting that the defenses of Hengzhou were solid and that the Guangdong and Guangxi armies had not yet advanced. He Jian also telegraphed from Changde, stating that he would return to the province on the 5th. He had instructed the generals in the Hengbao area to hold their positions and await orders and not to attack for the time being. On the evening of the 3rd, Commander-in-Chief Chiang also replied to Hunan, stating that he had dispatched the Central Army to Hunan to help defend the province immediately. Given this situation, a war in southern Hunan may break out. However, as of the evening of the 3rd, there were no reports of the Guangdong, Guangxi, or Zhang units arriving at the Hunan border. In order to prevent reactionary propaganda, the General Headquarters has specially appointed Section Chief Song Min as a news censor and has been implementing censorship of military news since the 3rd.

<h3 id="e77">Hubei Disaster Relief Branch Holds Emergency Meeting <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Decides to Establish Various Specialized Committees</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence, The Hubei Branch of the National Government's Flood Relief Committee held an emergency meeting of all Chinese and foreign committee members at 2:00 PM on the 5th. He Chengjun also attended the meeting. The meeting was presided over by Fang Benren, chairman of the committee. After the opening ceremony, the following announcements were made: (1) The disaster situation and relief efforts in Hankou (including the three towns of Wuhan). According to the disaster household survey form of the Wuhan Garrison Command, there are 700,000 disaster victims in Hankou, of which more than 276,000 are completely without food, clothing, and shelter and are in urgent need of relief. There are about 100,000 refugees who have fled from other counties and have not yet been included. These disaster victims were originally relieved by the Hubei Flood Relief Association, which was jointly formed by the Hubei Provincial Government, the Wuhan General Chamber of Commerce, and various charitable organizations, as well as various Chinese and foreign groups, individuals, and companies. The Hubei Flood Relief Association spent hundreds of thousands of yuan on relief funds, and the relief funds spent by various Chinese and foreign groups, individuals, and companies were even more numerous. The situation has become difficult for both public and private sectors. The branch should plan in advance how to subsidize the relief efforts in the future so that the lifeline of 270,000 disaster victims will not be interrupted. (2) The approximate number of disaster victims and relief efforts in various counties. After the floods in Hubei, 45 counties reported disasters one after another. The total population of the province is 35 million, with an average of more than 460,000 people per county. Among them, the number of people in need of relief in the disaster area is estimated to be half of the total population of the county, about 230,000 people per county, for a total of more than 10 million disaster victims. The Hubei Provincial Government has sent personnel to investigate and has telegraphed the county magistrates of each county to provide shelter and relief locally. However, the ground in each county is a vast expanse of water, and business has stopped. Where can relief supplies be obtained? The branch previously proposed to purchase a large amount of rice and distribute it according to the severity of the disaster in each county. At the same time, it telegraphed the Shanghai National Government Flood Relief Committee to quickly raise relief rice and transport it to Hankou, and to seek permission from Hunan, Jiangxi, and Anhui to temporarily relax the rice ban in order to raise funds for procurement. However, if each person's daily ration is calculated at 10 cents, 1 million yuan in national currency is needed, and if it is calculated at 5 cents, 500,000 yuan in foreign currency is needed. Other matters, such as the shelter, clothing, and epidemic prevention of disaster victims, should also be organized immediately, otherwise, millions of disaster victims will be allowed to die without being rescued, which would not be the most unfortunate thing for mankind in the world. The above points are all based on the branch's thorough investigation and statistics. We hope that everyone will express their opinions and do their best to show human compassion and relieve the disaster victims from their imminent doom. This is not only the blessing of Hubei but also the honor of our branch. Next, Chairman Fang Benren reported: (1) The US Consul General handed over US$100,000 donated by the American Red Cross for flood relief, equivalent to more than 457,700 yuan in national currency. (2) The Hubei Provincial Government handed over a telegram from Chairman Liu of Henan, stating that 10,000 reed mats have been purchased, and approximately 3,000 yuan are needed to transport them. Please send someone to escort them. (3) The disaster victim household registration forms for Wuhan and various counties have been formulated by the branch and sent to the provincial government for investigation and reporting. After the report, the formal discussion of the proposals began, and the following was decided: (1) A letter was sent to the provincial government requesting that reed sheds be built on Hongshan, Luojia Mountain, and other spacious locations outside the city to shelter refugees and maintain public security. A motion was made to transfer all refugees in the three towns of Wuhan to Hongshan and Luojia Mountain for shelter. (2) Committee Member Yu Zhi proposed that the disaster situation in the province is extremely severe, and all current relief and future rehabilitation affairs are numerous and need to be planned in detail in order to be beneficial and without harm. It is proposed that the branch hire specialized personnel to organize a specialized committee for employment relief (all matters related to relief and employment relief for disaster victims are included), a specialized committee for economy (all matters related to financial circulation, price stabilization, and the preparation and protection of agricultural affairs are included), and other specialized committees to conduct research and formulate specific plans for implementation. (3) Committee Member Huang Jianzhong proposed to establish a disaster victim education committee. It was decided that the above two proposals should be drafted by Committee Member Yu Zhi and Committee Member Huang Jianzhong and submitted to the next meeting for discussion. Committee Member Edward then made a temporary motion requesting that the Shanghai National Government Flood Relief Association be telegraphed to quickly telegraph the United States to raise large amounts of money for relief. It was decided to pass the motion and hand it over to the executive committee for handling. The meeting adjourned at about 5:00 PM. (September 5th)</p>
<h3 id="e78">The Yellow River's Water Level in Shandong Rises Again <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence, The Yellow River in Shandong had temporarily stabilized after the water level receded repeatedly since the end of last month. However, the water level in the upper reaches of Shaanxi Province has risen again, flowing down and causing the Yellow River in Shandong to rise again. It is estimated that the water level in Shaanxi Province rose 2.4 chi on the 3rd and another 1.5 chi on the 4th. The water that rose twice has now flowed to the middle reaches of Shandong. The water level at Luokou rose 1.1 chi yesterday and another 7 cun today (7th). This year, the water level rose to a maximum of 9 zhang 3 chi above sea level and fell to a minimum of 8 zhang 6 chi 3 cun. Now it has risen again, and the water level has reached 8 zhang 9 chi. However, the tributaries of the Yellow River east of Shaanxi Province, the Luo River and the Yi River, have not risen. Except for the Wangfu River in Changqing east of Zhengzhou, there are no more tributaries flowing into the Yellow River. Since the tributaries have not risen, they will not increase the Yellow River's water volume. The last rise in water in Shaanxi Province will also flow through the middle reaches, and the water level is unlikely to rise significantly again. However, hidden water is hot, and the force is above, while autumn water is cold, and the force is below. Scouring the roots of the dikes, the force of autumn water is the fiercest. When the Li Shengcun breach occurred in the fifteenth year of the Republic, the time was already September 20th. Therefore, even though autumn is approaching, optimism about the Yellow River is not warranted. If the upper reaches continue to rise, the three reaches of this province may not be able to avoid dangerous works again. (September 7th)</p>
<h3 id="e79">The Commissioners Dispatched by Supervisor Zhang Report on the Disaster Situation in Xinghua <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Yangzhou Correspondence, After the breach of the Grand Canal, in addition to dispatching Adjutant Song Bangrong to investigate the disaster and provide relief, Supervisor Zhang Zhijiang also dispatched Guo Bingquan on the 2nd to Xinghua, Yancheng area to conduct on-the-spot investigations of the disaster in order to accurately provide relief and rehabilitation. According to the report from the commissioners back to Yang, it is stated that it is approximately 130 li from Shaobo to Xinghua. The wind was favorable on the day of departure. He arrived at Yangjia Village. The water depth along the way was measured to be 1 zhang 2 chi. The houses were half-collapsed, and there were a few disaster victims either nesting in trees or living in small boats. Floating coffins could be seen drifting about. Three li from Guocun, a strong northwest wind arose, and the boat drifted with the wind to a place with many trees before stopping. The next morning, after traveling for three hours, the original route was found. After passing Liuan, he sailed to Fanchuan, where the water depth was approximately 3 chi and the houses were also half-collapsed. He traveled along the Gaotai border dike, which had been eroded by water into a serrated shape. Five li out, the dike had already been submerged in water. The boat entered the eastern border of Gaoyou, where the water depth in the paddy fields was 1 zhang 3 chi. There was a floating corpse tied to a tree in the forest, with a belly as big as a drum. In the evening, he arrived at Lao Ge Village in Xinghua. He passed through various villages for approximately ten hours and arrived outside the Zhongzheng Gate of the county, where the water depth was approximately 1 zhang 4 chi. Most of the villagers lived in small boats, guarding their former residences. Outside the South Gate of the county, there was a vast wilderness. From the east to Dongtai, from the west to Gaoyou, and from the south to Taixian, there were white waves, endless and boundless. On the morning of the 4th, he changed to a small boat to enter the city. The water outside the city had submerged half of the door, and the eaves of the deeper houses were level with the water. Inside the city, the water depth was 3 or 4 chi, and the entire city was flooded. Only the county government hall was free of water. At 8:00 AM, the county magistrate was ill in bed, and the section chief was also not on duty. Therefore, he went to Liujia Lane to meet Leng Zeng and went to the county government together to see Magistrate Hua, who inquired about the disaster situation. He replied that due to the continuous rain in summer, half of the fields had already been flooded. Since the Shaodi embankment was breached, the four villages had been submerged, and the people were using boats as homes. The southeast was higher, and there were fewer deaths. As for the relief affairs, the funds were exhausted. The county police force of more than 300 people had been in arrears for three months and had no ability to provide relief to the disaster victims. Fortunately, the province provided 5,000 yuan to purchase noodles for district relief. The province will continue to provide 8,000 yuan. The Jiangsu Relief Association will also come here to provide relief and intends to set up a refugee shelter in the county government, but this is only a drop in the bucket. It is hoped that all parties will provide rapid assistance. As for defense, although bandits are stirring, thanks to the strict defense of the police force, the water patrol team, and the local defense regiment, they are still able to coexist peacefully. When asked about the disaster situation in Yancheng, he replied that the telegraph was not working. However, Yancheng is higher, and it is said that the early rice has been harvested. The situation must be better. He then went to the chamber of commerce to meet Chairman Gu Lunan, who said the same as the county magistrate. He also asked about the method of receding water and replied that the most important thing was to block the breach of the canal embankment and open the Ziwu embankment (ie, the Dafeng embankment). The embankment is in Dongtai, 30 li from the East Sea. However, it is heard that Dafeng does not allow it to be opened. He begged to ask the supervisor to find a way. At the time, there was a Supervisory Inspector from the Civil Affairs Department who arrived from Tai County, saying that the disaster situation in Xinghua was the most serious, followed by Gaoyou Shaobo and the eastern part of Yancheng Tai County, and also said that the embankment had been opened on the 1st, but it was heard that it had been closed again. (September 8th)</p>
<h3 id="e80">Chu Minyi Reports on the Northwest Inspection Trip (Continued) <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>▲ Before departing for the Northwest, Minyi also made a statement, saying that the key to going to the Northwest lies in transportation. Therefore, there was a comparison between opening up Xinjiang and Zuo Zongtang's re-establishing Xinjiang in the past. When discussing these issues with various parties in Xinjiang, they all agreed that Minyi's proposition was correct. Now, returning east from Xinjiang, I deeply feel that the Xinjiang issue is still primarily about transportation. The key to transportation lies in efficient tools. Today's efficient transportation tools include automobiles, steamships, airplanes, and airships. However, none of these are suitable for desert areas. Since there are no railways or roads for automobiles in the desert, it is necessary to create transportation tools other than automobiles, steamships, airplanes, and airships. Therefore, upon hearing about the "crawling automobile" as an efficient tool specifically for traversing deserts, those concerned about transportation in the Northwest were greatly inspired and eager to try it out. If this type of equipment can be successful, it would solve a major problem of transportation in China's Northwest, which is of great importance to the national economy and the people's livelihood. The invention of machinery is a public contribution to humanity and the academic world, regardless of whether the inventor is Chinese or foreign. Therefore, when the French want to promote the capabilities of their crawling automobile, we especially hope for its successful crawling. To be honest, Minyi did not forget his mission of academic investigation and party affairs inspection at the time. However, the investigation and inspection were very short. I personally believe that if the crawling is successful and transportation becomes convenient, the Northwest will be accessible. Why have one investigation when you can have multiple? Why have a small number of people inspect when you can have a large number? What I dare to happily report now is that the crawling automobile is indeed an efficient tool for traversing the desert. China's Northwest transportation will surely usher in a new era because of this efficient tool. Therefore, this Sino-French cooperation can be said to be a failure, but the trial use of the crawling automobile for the development of Xinjiang must be said to be a success. The French side encountered many setbacks and could not meet as scheduled with the east and west teams, which can be said to be a failure. However, the academic investigation and party affairs inspection of the Chinese side must be said to be a success. Therefore, when Minyi saw that Northwest transportation could be solved and that the development of Xinjiang was promising, he felt boundless hope and joy when thinking about the future. He forgot the physical hardships he had suffered. He also forgot the temporary misunderstandings caused by delayed letters and telegrams. Some people deliberately provoked conflicts along the way, not only damaging the relationship between the Chinese and French teams, causing suspicion and resentment, and leading to quarrels and even fights. Even among the Chinese team members, this was the case. Hao Jun's beating and Bu An's throwing punches were nothing more than puppets of these instigators. Although Minyi felt unhappy at times, he believed that the truth would eventually come out. This kind of pain was also forgotten due to the idea that the Northwest could be crawled through and the development of Xinjiang was promising.</p>
<p>▲ There are three major trunk roads in the Northwest transportation routes. Minyi believes that the government should pay close attention and complete these three major trunk roads in the shortest possible time. Otherwise, the Northwest transportation and the development of Xinjiang are hopeless, and Mongolia and Xinjiang will inevitably fall into the hands of foreign powers. These three major trunk roads are: (1) Guihua via the Mongolian desert directly to Guchengzi, which is the camel road currently taken, requiring 70 days; (2) The former main road, from Beiping via 18 stations (each station being a day's journey, so 18 days) to Xi'an, then another 18 stations to Lanzhou, then another 18 stations to Suzhou, then another 18 stations to Hami, and then another 18 stations to Dihua, taking a total of 90 days. Beiping to Xi'an is already half train and half automobile, taking about 4 days. Xi'an to Lanzhou is already accessible by automobile, taking about 4 or 5 days. Hami to Dihua is also accessible by automobile, taking about 4 or 5 days. If the automobile road from Lanzhou to Suzhou and from Suzhou to Hami is repaired, then Lanzhou to Suzhou will take about 4 or 5 days, and Suzhou to Hami will take about 4 or 5 days. Combining the automobile journeys, the original 90-day journey can be shortened to 21 or 22 days; (3) The formerly known Yangguan Avenue, which goes south to Xinjiang, Hotan, Yutian, and then to Has. This is only a rough description of the route. As for the detailed plan for developing transportation and opening up the Northwest, I will submit my humble opinions and discuss them in detail separately.</p>
<h3 id="e81">The Third International and Soviet Russia's Conspiracy <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>(Continued from Third)</p>
<p>(9) Report from the Central Bureau of the Soviet Area to the Central Committee (April 19)</p>
<p>To the Central Committee: Regarding our recent combat situation, we can report on the following aspects:</p>
<p>Comrades Xiang Ying (transliteration), Bolinsky, Komornar, and three shortwave telegraph operators have all arrived here one after another. Xiang Ying arrived on January 11, and the Central Bureau was formally organized on the 15th. The Central Revolutionary Military Commission has also been established for many days. The chairman of the commission is Xiang Ying, and Comrades Zhu De and Mao Zedong are acting as agents for various affairs.</p>
<p>In addition to the members originally appointed by the Central Committee, the Central Bureau of the Soviet Area has elected Zhu De, Zheng Bingjun, Chen Yi, Zhu Yili, Peng Dehuai, and Lin Biao as members of the bureau at a recent expanded meeting. We request that this point be ratified.</p>
<p>The expanded meeting discussed in detail the various resolutions of the Fourth Congress. As a result, it unanimously agreed with all of those resolutions, as well as the measures taken by the Central Committee against right-wing rebels.</p>
<p>The truth about the Fujian incident has recently been fully exposed. Various proofs show that the incident was a rebellious movement by the AB League. The handling of the incident by the Forward Committee was very appropriate. However, the group has not yet been effectively reorganized, so it remains a serious problem at present.</p>
<p>At present, the enemy's army has not yet come into contact with our main force, but is only gradually approaching us. We have decided to first defeat part of their vanguard, and then determine our strategy. We have heard that the Seventh and Twentieth Armies of the Red Army have repeatedly won victories in western Jiangxi and are now attacking Taihe, but we have not yet received definite reports.</p>
<p>This place urgently needs guidance personnel. Please assign some more for application. We are about to depart, so we are only making a brief report as above. Central Bureau of the Soviet Area, April 19.</p>
<p>(30) Report from Luo (transliteration) entrusted to Gannadi. The National Labor Congress has decided to establish a steel committee within this week. The responsibility for leading the congress should be borne by comrades in Hong Kong. The dissatisfaction of CC members with this proposal has been mentioned in the previous report. This issue should be resolved together with PB. In the Shanghai Arsenal, we have an original red workers' organization, so the above-mentioned liaison organization can be established. There are also party activities in Shanxi, Henan, and Manchuria. There is also contact with steel workers in the Shanghai Jiangnan Shipyard and Hong Kong. (32) Letter from the Secretariat of the Pacific Trade Union Confederation to the National Labor Congress.</p>
<p>To the comrades of the National Labor Congress: After receiving the work plan of the congress in various districts directly under the Soviet Union, we have carefully examined it. In general, it is free from errors, but there are several points that must be clarified:</p>
<p>1. The issue of agricultural workers, namely, how to organize them into ordinary trade unions, and what is their relationship with poor farmers, especially with poor farmers' groups? The elements of this issue are obvious and without doubt, namely, that agricultural workers must be organized immediately and made into general trade unions, just like workers engaged in other industries. Agricultural workers' associations can be our most useful tool. Once this association is formed, we can use it to win over the hearts of poor farmers and benefit from the equalization of land revolution. Therefore, there must be very close contact and the closest relationship between agricultural workers, coolies, and poor farmers. In this way, agricultural workers, with the help of other artisans, can fulfill their leadership responsibilities. However, it seems that the organizational relationship between agricultural workers and poor farmers' groups is still unclear. Section B of the fourth section of the plan proposed by your congress says (middle peasants must unite with poor farmers' groups, and agricultural workers' associations can immediately join various poor farmers' groups and fulfill their leadership responsibilities to form a united front). Here, we should be more clear. Agricultural workers in any village should be organized in the same way as workers in other professions, each forming its own union. For example, a district branch of agricultural workers should be organized in a village, while the poor farmers in that village should form their own poor farmers' group. Agricultural workers are the most aware of the hardships of the peasant class. With the help of more experienced civilians in the trade unions, they can take the initiative in everything and fulfill their leadership responsibilities in organizing matters in poor farmers' groups. However, these agricultural workers, even if they are organized into groups, or as a district branch of a village, do not join the poor farmers' groups as members. They often hold regular meetings with poor farmers at that time, and hold joint meetings, and at the meeting, these groups often send their own representatives, just like brothers in the same association. Also, agricultural workers and poor farmers oppose landlords, moneylenders, the Kuomintang, and other warlords, in order to seek the complete victory of the equalization of land revolution. Both have the same immediate interests, but the farming workers' group must be maintained and developed into a general trade union, uniting with the revolutionary trade unions in the current Soviet Union-administered areas and the National Labor Congress, and under their command and control. The poor farmers' groups are not independent organizations, they are established within a village, and their duties are to be carried out under the orders of the Soviet administrator of that village. The only duty that they should fulfill is to assist the Soviet administrator in implementing the equalization of land revolution, and to fight against the forces of the Kulaks (rich peasants). This is why all farming workers must participate in the work of the poor farmers' groups, and the agricultural workers' associations must fulfill their leadership responsibilities in this important activity. In addition, coolies and artisans may also participate. Therefore, we propose that the above-mentioned items should be inserted into the draft, so as to avoid any misunderstanding of the meaning of the reorganization of the agricultural workers' associations in the countryside and the annexation of the poor farmers' groups by the agricultural workers' associations. There is also (We must firmly oppose the immediate adoption of collective farming. This attempt at collectivization is entirely initiated by the peasants, is out of the peasants' free will, and is without any external pressure) in the same section of the draft. There are also cases where farmers voluntarily organize groups for the purpose of making full use of their property. If we encounter such a situation, we will not prohibit or prevent it. The same section of the draft also discusses two types of farmers and two forms of agricultural workers' associations: (1) agricultural workers' associations; (2) short-term workers' associations (the organization of short-term workers' associations is temporarily placed under the guidance of agricultural workers' associations). We propose that the draft sets up two different organizations, which is easy to cause disputes, so one item must be deleted. Only one agricultural workers' association should be set up in a village or county. Its short-term workers can join the short-term workers' section of the association. Anyone who takes on regular work, or short-term work, or occasional work, or only takes on work in a certain season of the year, can be regarded as an agricultural worker and join the short-term workers' section of the agricultural workers' association. Anyone who has obtained a piece of land after the peasant revolution, and is still a land worker at some time, can be classified into this category. Some people think that there are no more agricultural workers after the land distribution, so there is no need for agricultural workers' associations. We must make every effort to attack this fallacy.</p>
<p>2. The section on (systematic development and leadership of the workers' class struggle) in the draft is generally correct, but we have one more proposal, namely, that any instructions you draw up for comrades who are going to work in the Soviet areas must insert Article 8 of the draft labor law regarding the right to strike, or record all of it in it (Under Soviet law, trade unions have the freedom of action, the right of organization, the right to express declarations, negotiate, and conclude treaties). We must declare the organization and leadership of workers' struggles in order to implement the provisions of the labor law.</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>Before the labor law is implemented, that is, to implement the principles detailed in our draft.) This is not only the right of our class trade unions in the Soviet areas, but also their due responsibility. The distinction between state-owned enterprises and private enterprises is very important for strikes, and it is recognized that state-owned enterprises in the current stage of class struggle are in urgent need of defending the Red Army and the Soviet government. However, this is not to say that we prohibit strikes in state-owned enterprises. The basic provisions of the Labor Law, such as the eight-hour work day and the minimum wage, must be strictly observed in state-owned enterprises. If the military situation in the Red Army and the Soviet areas requires the concentration of forces to supply armaments and food, workers can voluntarily increase their working hours under the leadership of the trade union to protect the safety of the Soviet government. However, this kind of action cannot take the form of a Soviet order, and the same is true for the prohibition of strikes. This is the most important propaganda work and organizational work of the trade union.</p>
<p>3. Regarding the organizational work in the Soviet area in Section 6, we also have a proposal, namely, that special attention must be paid to the necessity of trade unions having true proletarian leaders. This leadership staff,</p>
<p>Must be selected by the workers themselves from among the workers' class, in order to ensure the safety of the Soviet government and the Red Army. According to our opinion, a paragraph should be inserted in the section on the internal daily life and activities of the trade union, namely, the issue of regular meetings and membership review meetings, as well as the issue of voluntary membership fees. However, membership fees must be paid on time to ensure the financial security of the trade union.</p>
<p>4. Regarding the relationship between the trade union and the Soviet organs in Section 10, according to our opinion, a paragraph should be inserted, namely, that for the workers of our trade union in the urban and rural soviets, trade union members should actively participate in the local Soviet elections, so that the most proletarian-conscious factory workers, handicraftsmen, and agricultural workers in the Soviet areas can work hand in hand with poor farmers. The (Labor Committee) and (Labor Inspector) must be directly introduced and appointed by the trade union. In addition, the personnel of organizations such as social insurance and labor security cooperatives must also be directly appointed by the trade union. In the section on production control, how to control production in private enterprises should be explained. The labor management committee elected by the workers and directly guided by the trade union must first pay attention to ensuring that the provisions of the labor law are implemented, and that employers or their agents do not engage in any sabotage or counter-revolutionary actions, so that the workers of private enterprises are adequately prepared to support the Red Army and the Soviet Union. These committees should also be given the right to inspect the business accounts of private enterprises in order to implement the provisions of the Labor Law. The control and management of workers in state-owned enterprises are very different from the special functions of the workers' control committees in the above-mentioned private enterprises, and we should distinguish between them.</p>
<p>5. Regarding the unemployment issue in Section 9, one point that must be given special attention is that the Soviet government is currently fighting a life-and-death struggle with the enemy, and this struggle cannot be successful in the short term, so the work of dealing with mass unemployment should not be added to the Soviet government's body. Enlist the best members of the unemployed workers into the Red Army, and provide unemployment relief from the social insurance organs stipulated by the Labor Law (this is difficult to implement for a while), and prepare an unemployed workers' fund, which is managed by the trade union. All of these are the main plans at present.</p>
<p>6. It is important to form all transport workers, such as boatmen, coachmen, sedan chair carriers, and rickshaw pullers, into a united association in the draft, but we must distinguish between water transport, land transport, and railway transport. At present, these three should be organized into various industrial unions separately. Those engaged in water transport (including port workers) can form a union, railway workers can form a railway workers' union, and other land transport workers can form another union.</p>
<p>7. Special attention must be paid to the organization of women and young people. One important point that must be noted is that women or young people do not need to independently organize a union. Female workers and male workers can join the same union, and their obligations and rights are the same as male workers. Female workers over the age of fourteen must also be organized, and can also join the trade union, and have the same rights. The youth department can be set up in the trade union, and is directly managed and guided by the trade union.</p>
<p>8. The following items should be inserted in the section on propaganda work: disseminating the activity plan of the Secretariat of the Pacific Trade Union Confederation, breaking down local feelings and isolationism, the issue of international interdependence, the struggle of workers in other colonial and semi-colonial countries and imperialist countries, pointing out the need to report to the Secretariat of the Pacific Trade Union Confederation on time and contact it.

<p>The target donation amount is set at 500,000 yuan</p>
<p>However, Zhang Xueliang advocates providing relief with grain</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: Liaoning circles believe that the Yangtze and Han river floods are severe and that it is not enough to provide relief without concentrating the strength of the whole country. Previously, the Party Department specially convened the (Liaoning Circles Relief Association for the Yangtze and Huai River Floods), which had convened two preparatory meetings. At 10:30 am on the 5th, the association convened an establishment meeting in the Party Department auditorium of the province. More than 40 representatives from all walks of life, including Chen Wenxue, Zhu Guangmu, and Ms. Su Bei, attended the meeting. More than 40 members of the Provincial Party Department, including Xing Shilian and Li Shaoyuan, attended the meeting. Xing Shilian chaired the meeting. After the meeting began, the organizational outline of the conference was first approved. The content was based on the draft method submitted by Chen Wenxue at the discussion meeting on the 4th. After consulting various opinions, the wording was slightly increased or decreased, but the principle was not changed. The name of the conference was then changed to (Liaoning All-Circles Relief Association for National Floods). The organization was changed to a committee system, and leaders of various agencies and legal entities were elected as members of the committee. Zhang Xueliang was elected as the chairman, Zang Shiyi was the vice chairman, and Chen Wenxue was the general secretary. They would follow the chairman's instructions to lead the directors and directors of each department to handle daily affairs. The candidates would be drafted by Chen and submitted to the board meeting on the 7th for approval, and then they could officially start working. The donation amount was temporarily set at 500,000 yuan, and 100,000 yuan would be borrowed from the banking sector in advance for remittance. The meeting period was set for three months. The establishment telegram and notice of the conference had been drafted by the Provincial Party Department. After being read aloud at the scene, they were handed over to Chen Wenxue to submit to the Vice Chairman Zang Shiyi for review, and it was decided to send them out on the 7th. The meeting adjourned at 12:30. The following items were resolved on the same day:</p>
<p>(1) This association is jointly organized by the provincial government, military, academic, agricultural, industrial, commercial, women, banking, transportation sectors, and other social groups. (2) This association is a committee system. Zhang Xueliang is elected as the chairman, Zang Shiyi is elected as the vice chairman, and there is one general secretary, and Chen Wenxue is publicly appointed to take the position. There are also three groups: General Affairs, Fundraising, and Publicity. Each group has a director, who is appointed by the general secretary. (3) Leaders from all circles are members of this association. (4) The minimum amount to be raised is 500,000 yuan. (5) Political organs in the provincial capital and various counties are guided by the provincial government, the military is assigned by the Border Defense Department, agriculture, industry and commerce are assigned by various guilds, the academic community is assigned by the Education Department, the banking sector is assigned by the banking groups, the press is assigned by the Press Association, individual families are assigned by women's groups, and entertainment events are assigned by the Public Security Bureau and the Boy Scouts. In addition, artists are solicited for various works to be auctioned off as donations. (6) The official silver firm is the collection agency of this association. (7) Individuals who donate more than 100 yuan have the right to designate a certain place for relief. (8) All donations are requested to be remitted free of charge by various banks, and various railways and ferries are requested to transport relief supplies free of charge. (9) This association convenes a board meeting once every two weeks.</p>
<p>Another message, the Liaoning Flood Relief Association has been established, and the donation amount is set at 500,000 yuan. 100,000 yuan will be borrowed from the banking sector first to remit to the Central Government, and the rest will be remitted one after another. Grain is also accepted. This is the method decided by the Flood Relief Association. Deputy Zhang sent a telegram to Shenyang, ordering the five northeastern provinces to assist with 30,000 dan of grain (a large dou in Fengtian, which is equivalent to about 60,000 shi in the south, worth 320,000 yuan at current market prices), without mentioning raising cash. The Political Committee meeting yesterday decided that the Northeast has been in financial difficulties recently and has a surplus of grain, so the relief will be provided by transporting grain instead of cash. The 30,000 dan will be distributed among the five provinces, with 8,000 for Liaoning, 7,000 for Jilin, 5,500 each for Heilongjiang and Harbin, and 4,000 for Rehe, half sorghum and half millet. They will be collected in Liaoning and Yingkou in the future, and transported by southern ships. All provinces have been notified. This method conflicts with the Liaoning Flood Relief Association, and the association may change its method, but it is not yet known. (September 5)</p>
<h3 id="e83">Wuhu Express Letter <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>▲ In order to prepare for setting up commissioners in various provinces in the future to handle post-flood relief, the National Government's Flood Relief Committee has specially appointed Zhang Ru, Zhao Shouyu, Li Jinzhang, and Yuan Shan as flood inspection commissioners for the four provinces of Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi. Zhang arrived in Wuhu yesterday and immediately contacted the county government. Today, he personally went to the disaster area for inspection, and then went to Fanchang and other counties in southern Anhui, and then went to central and northern Anhui for inspection.</p>
<p>▲ Sanshan Town, Fanchang County, which is 40 li away from Wuhu, was recently raided by about 300 bandits from Wuwei. They were riding in more than 20 civilian boats, parked in the middle of the Jiayi River, with complete firearms and flags painted with knives and axes. They landed and caused trouble, and planned to occupy Jitou Mountain as a defensive measure. After Fanchang County urgently transferred a large number of police teams, together with the self-defense regiments of nearby townships, they surrounded and attacked from both sides the night before. The bandits also resisted stubbornly. After several hours of fierce fighting, more than 140 bandits were killed on the spot, more than 40 were captured alive, 40 long guns were seized, and more than 20 hostages were rescued. The remaining bandits have now fled.</p>
<p>▲ Regarding the Wuhu rapeseed export issue, rice merchants said that rapeseed exports are not exclusively sold to Japan, and there are also sales markets in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. They have requested that the Anti-Japanese Aid Overseas Chinese Association postpone the ban on exports. However, the Anti-Japanese Association held a meeting today and resolved that the rapeseed transported out by Taikoo and Jardine Matheson in recent days is mostly resold to the Japanese. From today onwards, they will still be detained across the board, and the lighter workers will be ordered to stop handling them.</p>
<p>▲ Qian Danwu, a special investigator from the Central Relief Committee, and Wen Yi from the Provincial Committee, went from Wuhu to Fanchang to investigate. The entire county has no land without water, and no homes are not disaster-stricken. There are no villages, and more than 2,000 people have drowned, and more have committed suicide. They have sent a special telegram to the Central Government, requesting immediate assistance.</p>
<p>▲ The Anhui Education Department believes that the flood in Anhui Province this time is severe, and the impact on schools in various places is significant. A complete investigation and reorganization is necessary. In addition to dispatching school inspectors Li Guanglie and Deng Jixuan to inspect various counties, they have also dispatched Section Chief Yang Zhongming to inspect Wuhu and nearby counties. The number of new and old students attending school, as well as the damage to school supplies, and the methods and opinions for reorganization in the future must be thoroughly investigated and verified.</p>
<p>▲ At 2:00 pm today, the Wuhu County Government convened a flood relief meeting for all circles, attended by more than 50 representatives from various agencies and organizations. They discussed the method of universally distributing emergency relief throughout the disaster area and resolved to purchase 6,000 bags of flour and reed mats, etc., and distribute them in six major districts on the 13th. In addition to the heads of the township public security bureaus and the heads of the autonomous public offices, 30 people automatically signed up to participate on the spot by the county head of the Public Security Bureau. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 pm. (September 8)</p>

<p>Bandit Leader Lu Yaosheng and Others Executed by Firing Squad: Lu Yaosheng, a pseudo-regiment commander under the command of Ah Shu, a bandit leader of Lake Tai, was captured by the Fengxian County police team and transferred to the Songhu Pacification Sub-district Command for interrogation. He confessed without denial to forming a gang to kidnap and rob various cities and towns in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Additionally, bandits Zhang Aliu, Wu Ayun (also known as Wang Liansheng), Yang Agen, Lu Aming (also known as Lu Zugen), and Sun Tuozi and five others, bandits active in the Quan Gong Ting New Town area, were all clearly interrogated and sentenced to death. The sentences were submitted to Zhang, the Jiangsu Pacification Commissioner, and approved by telegram for execution. After receiving the telegram, Commander Cao signed and brought the bandit leader Lu Yaosheng and others to the headquarters, verified their identities, and had them bound. After taking photographs, police escorted them on a parade through the busy city for a week before executing them by firing squad at the Yu Huang Ge execution grounds. When the bandit leader Lu Yaosheng and others were brought out of the prison gate, seeing the crowded onlookers, they knew their death was near. They chatted and laughed freely, looking around at the crowd, and their expressions did not change until the execution. They can truly be said to be the most extreme examples of those who disregard the law and are not afraid of death.</p>

<p>Local Gentry Telegraphs for Urgent Repair of Embankment: The first section of the Jinshanwei seawall in this county was severely impacted by heavy rain and strong waves for six consecutive days. The embankment patrolman deeply feared that it would be breached, and with the autumn flood season approaching rapidly, the consequences of not taking preventive measures would be enormous. Yesterday, local gentry Geng Daochong, Cai Guanghui, and others urgently telegraphed Governor Ye of the province, stating: "Various sections of the Songjiang seawall west of the pond are historically known to be vulnerable. This summer, wind, rain, and storm tides have eroded and threatened to breach the embankment. The Chamber of Commerce has already telegraphed the province to appeal for assistance. Unexpectedly, on September 6th, the second section is also on the verge of failure, making the situation even more critical. If preventive measures are not taken promptly, the autumn flood season will bring even greater disaster. We earnestly request that you dispatch personnel to urgently repair the embankment as quickly as possible to protect the lives of all the people."</p>

<p>Telegraphic Request to Stop Opening the East Dam: The Wuxian County Chamber of Commerce, based on reports that the authorities were planning to open the East Dam, telegraphed Governor Ye of Jiangsu Province yesterday (the 9th), stating, "Reports indicate that Gaochun is flooded and that there are plans to open the East Dam. If this is implemented, all counties south of the Yangtze River will definitely be submerged. Considering the tragic robberies in Gao and Shao, we are sending this telegram to request a swift halt to the opening and to prevent further urgent pleas.” The county government also expressed its views on this matter.</p>
<p>Raping of a Thirteen-Year-Old Girl: Zhou Laoer, a wine shop owner residing at No. 33 Xihuaqiao Lane, aged thirty-seven, lured Ah Genjin, a thirteen-year-old girl residing at Tangju's house in Qianwanli Bridge, to Room No. 7 of the Tailu Hotel last month and raped her twice. Tang Ajin suffered severe injuries to her lower body but dared not speak about it at her mother’s place. Unexpectedly, the injuries worsened daily, and her lower body even ulcerated. Only then did she tell her mother, who reported it to the First Public Security Bureau. Zhou has not been apprehended. Zhou's cohabiting couple, Gao Shuangxi and his wife, were detained by the bureau for questioning about Zhou's whereabouts. On the night of the 8th, Zhou Laoer was finally arrested and taken to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<p>Notorious Bandit Zheng Ming Executed: Zheng Ming, a maritime bandit from Dongxing Township in this county, committed a crime in Shanghai. After his arrest, Detective Captain Zhu Shunqing brought Zheng back. At the same time, Zheng’s associates, Hu Peilin and others, were also brought to Changshu. According to Zheng's repeated confessions, he made no denials, stating precisely which crimes he committed and which he did not, consistent to the end. Knowing that he would certainly be sentenced to death, he asked the judge to execute him as soon as possible. After receiving the confession, the county government telegraphed the province for instructions. On the evening of the 8th, the county government received a telegram from the province authorizing the execution of Zheng by firing squad. At seven o'clock the next morning, police and public security officers went to the East Gate Prison to bring Zheng out. At that time, many members of the public went to watch. When Zheng was brought out of the prison gate and saw this scene, he asked the bailiff, "Is this my day to go to heaven?" The bailiff did not answer. Zheng laughed wildly until he reached the county government, where he was questioned by Judge Shen Cheng about any final words. He replied that he had none, and along the way, he loudly sang excerpts from the opera "Mao Yanshou". Soon, he was taken to the execution ground and immediately shot. Zheng Ming was from Yancheng, Jiangbei, grew up in Wangshi Town, Changshu, and was twenty-four years old.</p>

The Public Security Bureau detained him and sent him to the county court, where he was interrogated and detained for several months. Yesterday afternoon at five o'clock, Judge Liang opened the court and sentenced Ye to four years of imprisonment for the crime of carnal knowledge of a girl under the age of sixteen. Ye expressed his dissatisfaction with the verdict. However, his wife, Wu, upon hearing the verdict, cried loudly and, because her husband declared his dissatisfaction, rushed to Judge Liang's table, stating that she was desperately poor and unable to appeal, and pleading for a reduction of her husband's sentence. Judge Liang ordered the court police to persuade her to leave. Wu had no choice but to leave in tears.</p>
<p>Business Tax Bureau Conducts Re-inspections: There are currently only eighteen business tax bureaus in Jiangsu Province. In counties with finance bureaus, the finance bureau chief also serves as the business tax bureau chief. In counties without finance bureaus, the county magistrate also serves, paid for by the province. In this county, the annual business tax for various industries in the urban area is approximately 70,000 yuan. The annual tax for various industries in the rural area is approximately 10,000 yuan, totaling approximately 80,000 yuan per year. Currently, the first batch of taxes paid by more than eighty industries in the urban area's Chamber of Commerce has been delivered to the bureau. Various industries not in the Chamber of Commerce are directly collected by the bureau. Only a few towns in the rural area have paid. The bureau is actively working on this. The bureau is currently issuing business licenses to various industries in the urban area that have paid their taxes. Once this is completed, personnel will be dispatched to conduct re-inspections.</p>

<p>Petition for Dispatch of Personnel to Settle Arrears in Education Funds: Jiangyin's education funds have been in arrears for four and a half months. Teachers are teaching on empty stomachs, making it difficult to continue. Salary-seeking riots are likely to occur everywhere. The treatment of teachers in Jiangyin is originally very meager. The monthly salary of junior teachers is only seven or eight yuan. Even if they are paid in full every month, it is still difficult to make a living, let alone with such a large amount in arrears. How can they teach with peace of mind? Lu Lifan, the director of the education bureau, attributed the arrears to the ineffective collection of land taxes by the finance bureau. He previously submitted separate reports to the provincial government's finance and education departments, strictly ordering the finance bureau to expedite collection. Director Shen of the finance bureau replied, stating that there were no arrears and that there was no misappropriation. The education department then ordered the education bureau to verify in detail and report the amounts of assessed and collected taxes, as well as the amount of education funds received by the bureau, for future reference. After receiving the order, Director Lu checked the bureau's budget book. The total amount of assessed taxes for the 17th, 18th, and 19th years was 515,367 yuan. The finance bureau's book showed that 317,708 yuan, 7 jiao, 5 fen, and 2 li of education funds had been collected, including the first half of the 16th year. After checking this against the amount received by the bureau, there was no significant discrepancy. The bureau's arrears amounted to 246,136 yuan. The finance bureau's book showed that 221,620 yuan, 6 jiao, and 4 fen, 6 li of education funds had not been collected, a difference of 24,515 yuan, 3 jiao, 5 fen, and 4 li. This was due to the poor harvest in the 18th year. Whether the numbers match or not requires the finance bureau to provide the number of tenants and the amount of land, so that it can be calculated. As the finance bureau's book shows that 221,620 yuan, 6 jiao, and 4 fen, 6 li have not been collected, accounting for more than 43% of the assessed amount, the location of the arrears, whether it is misappropriated by the finance bureau, or due to official arrears or civil arrears, cannot be understood without a thorough investigation. Therefore, the education department is asked to strictly order the finance bureau to expedite the collection of the outstanding education funds to alleviate the urgent need and, on the one hand, send personnel to clean up the situation together in order to maintain education.</p>

<p>Request to Restore Shipping on the Canal: The Temporary Charity Relief Association for Water Disaster in Jiangbei requested that the Chamber of Commerce and Temporary Relief Association for Water Disaster in Huai'an and Gaoyou counties send a telegram to request the immediate resumption of shipping to facilitate travel and to alleviate commercial difficulties due to the receding canal water. They also received a letter from Leng and Lu, the two directors of the association, stating that the Zhenqing and Zhentai steamers should urgently resume traffic to facilitate relief efforts and convenience commerce. This was immediately submitted to the association's fifth standing committee meeting, which resolved to request the shipping association to investigate and comply. Yesterday, a letter was also sent to the provincial government ordering the shipping association to comply in order to facilitate relief efforts and convenience transportation. It is expected that the resumption of the two small steamers will not be far off. However, it is heard that the shipping association is concerned because the previous Zhu Fang steamer was burned by rioters at the Yangtze Bridge. Although the government recognized the compensation, it has not yet been resolved. If it is desired to resume service this time, the government must provide adequate protection and resolve the donation losses as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The Main Culprit in the Xu Zhuoran Assassination Case Escorted to Hangzhou: In the case of the assassination of Xu Zhuoran in Fujian, the Hangzhou County District Court sentenced Ye Caizhen, Chen Yanxiang, and Chen Delin to not guilty. Lin Luo was sentenced to four years for privately possessing military weapons. The prosecutor investigating the case, Chen Huaming, and the plaintiff, Xu Ye’s family, did not accept the verdict and filed a public prosecution with the High Court. The three suspects in the case, Chen Chang, Zhang Jichang, and Liu Zhi, were escorted from Fujian. On August 11th, the First Criminal Court of the High Court summoned thirteen people, including the original plaintiffs, defendants, and criminals in the case, to open the trial. Because Chen Chang and Zhang Jichang were highly suspected, and the three defendants Ye Caizhen and others requested bail, it was ruled that they would each pay a bail of 20,000 yuan. Chen Jiageng, an overseas Chinese, bailed out Ye Caizhen and Chen Yanxiang with 40,000 yuan. It is now known that Lin Min, the main culprit who assassinated Xu, was captured by the Tong'an garrison in Fujian on June 19th. The High Court specially dispatched Shen Weiqing, a clerk of the Criminal Court, and four bailiffs to Fujian to escort him back. He was escorted to Hangzhou on the evening of the 8th. After being briefly questioned by the prosecutor, he was sent to the detention center to await trial.</p>
<p>Verdict Announced in the Case of Trafficking a Huge Amount of Red Pills: In the case of the seizure of a large batch of 400,000 red pills at the Jiang Qiannanxing Station, the main criminals Huang Chunyan, Yao Hairong, and Li Chucai, and six others, including Hong Peiyun, the owner of the Guotang business, Hong Youlan, the bookkeeper, and Shen Qing, the assistant manager of the Shenda Company, were arrested. After the investigation was completed, the verdict was announced yesterday. Huang Chunyan, Yao Hairong, and Li Chucai were each sentenced to three years of imprisonment and fined 2,000 yuan each for the crime of jointly trafficking in opium substitutes. Hong Peiyun, Hong Youlan, and Shen Qingde were each sentenced to one year of imprisonment and fined 1,000 yuan each for the crime of joint transportation.</p>

<p>Dispute Over the Demarcation of Police Districts by the Public Security Bureau: The County Public Security Bureau previously divided the entire county into four police districts based on the revised Organizational Regulations of the Public Security Bureau of Zhejiang Province. The Fourth Branch Bureau divided Songxia into the first section and Lihai Office into the second section, and withdrew the police officers from the Lihai Office Public Security Sub-station belonging to Shaoxing. A police station was established in the territory of the Lihai Office, which belongs to Yu County. This caused opposition from all sectors of Lihai Office. The reason is that the Lihai Public Security Sub-station was established with the approval of local gentry Yang Zhaochun during the era when Qu Yingguang was the Zhejiang Patrol Envoy during the Republic of China and has been in existence for eighteen years. The province approved the establishment of the police bureau because the area is indeed a strategic coastal location. Considering the actual situation of the area, it is twenty li away from Songxia, and it is extremely inconvenient to merge with Songxia and establish a police station. It is proposed to follow the precedent of the recent dispute between the Linpu Public Security Sub-stations of Shaoxing and Su counties over the jurisdiction of the police district, and unanimously advocate retaining the original Lihai Office Public Security Sub-station. On the 31st of last month, a representative was dispatched to order the Lihai Office Public Security Sub-station to postpone the abolishment, and the original proposal to implement it from the 1st of September was suspended. It is now known that various sectors of the town have been meeting for days to carefully plan a method of retention.</p>

<p>Defeated Hujiang 36-30 Last Night</p>
<p>Jinan Won Against Military Academy in Overtime</p>
<p>Score: 55 to 52</p>
<p>The Qingguang basketball team defeated the powerful Hujiang team 36-30 in the second act of the disaster relief basketball game last night. The score was close, and the performance was excellent, especially Qingguang's performance in the second half, which was particularly impressive. In the first game, Jinan won against the Military Academy 55-52 in overtime.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Jinan Wins Against Military Academy <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The Military Academy performed very well in the first half, winning 26-17 against Jinan. After the second half, with the score at 42-31, Jinan gradually caught up, ending in a 44-44 tie. There was a ten-minute overtime. In the first five minutes, Jinan won 50-46. The Military Academy added four points, and it was a tie again. The atmosphere was tense. Jinan finally won 55-52. The referee was Qu Hongren.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Qingguang Triumphs Over Hujiang <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>The battle between Qingguang and Hujiang, a sequel to their previous encounter, saw both teams with high hopes in the City Games. Last night, Qingguang steadily improved after a slow start, ultimately winning with a score of 36 to 30, a truly remarkable feat. The referee was Shao Ji.</p>
<p>▲The tension of the match was such that the difference between the scores of the two teams was usually only two or three points, a very close margin. Initially, the five young tiger generals of Hujiang scored seven points in one go. Within ten minutes, Qingguang caught up, making the score seven to nine. Hujiang then deployed its university team. Qingguang then evened the score at fourteen to fourteen. In the first half, Hujiang narrowly won by two points, sixteen to fourteen. In the second half, Hujiang's youth team scored again, leaving only Lu Zhong'en. Qingguang added Lu Dazhen, which became a turning point. After several ties, each at twenty-six, Qingguang then surpassed Hujiang from then on, sailing smoothly to victory with a score of thirty-six to thirty.</p>
<p>▲Qingguang's prowess was evident in Tan Dahua's undiminished power, with his brilliant moments visible. His individual skills are rare. The defense and offense of Zhang Jinxiang, the defender, were truly his contribution last night. Xu Kepei's shooting accuracy was slightly lacking, and the addition of Lu Dazhen was a major factor in Qingguang's turnaround.</p>
<p>▲Hujiang's triple substitution: Hujiang first used its middle school team for ten minutes, then its university team for the rest of the first half. In the second half, the middle school team reappeared, leaving only Lu Zhong'en. The three forwards of the middle school team were incredibly agile, with their shooting skills particularly outstanding. The university team's forwards were completely ineffective. The substitution occurred mid-game, which was one of the reasons for the loss. Furthermore, the three young men gradually exhausted their energy, leading to their falling behind, which was also a significant failure. In terms of performance, they were by no means weak.</p>

<h3 id="e116">The Question of the Top Ten Tennis Players in China - Lin Baohua Did Not Boast About Being Number One <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>His Respected Father, Mr. Lin Shufen, Writes to Clarify</p>
<p>Mr. Lin's Original Intention Was to Encourage Young Rising Talents</p>
<p>Mr. Liu's Comments Can Be Used for Future Reference</p>
<p>Since this newspaper disclosed ("Mr. Liu Keng's Discussion with Mr. Lin Baohua Regarding the Rankings of the Top Ten Tennis Players in China"), people in the tennis world have paid close attention. Yesterday, the editor received a letter from Mr. Lin Shufen, the respected father of Lin Baohua, clarifying that Lin Baohua did not boast about being number one. Moreover, the focus of his discussion was on how recent masters have improved their techniques, with the sincere intention of encouraging young rising talents, and with no malice or favoritism involved. It is noted that the Chinese National Amateur Athletic Federation will invite domestic and foreign masters to gather in Shanghai for performances before this year's National Games. At that time, the rankings of the top ten players may be officially produced. As Mr. Liu Keng's expressed his views in response to Mr. Lin's discussion of the rankings of the top ten players, and since Mr. Lin did not intend to compile a list of the top ten masters, Mr. Liu's comments can be reserved for future reference. The original letter from his respected father, Lin Shufen, is attached below:</p>
<p>To the Sports Editor of Shen Bao,</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>I read yesterday's report in your newspaper about Mr. Liu Keng's conversation with a reporter from the Shih Pao regarding Chinese masters. I was also present. Without any malice or favoritism, and knowing that even the best sun does not shine for long, I sincerely wanted to encourage talented young people so that they can restore China's reputation in tennis at the 10th Far Eastern Championship Games. There was no intention to slight Mr. Liu, Mr. Jiang, or other masters. I hope that national players with a generous and chivalrous spirit will not hesitate to sacrifice a little to encourage the enthusiasm and interest of rising talents.</p>
<p>(2) When talking with the Shih Pao reporter, Baohua did not mention his own name, so how could he have been intending to demean others? He was actually trying to guess which young, promising talents in China might have the opportunity to represent China in the future. He was not aware of those who were in Shanghai or abroad. This was not intended to compile a list of the top ten masters. Generally speaking, there are many tennis enthusiasts in Shanghai and elsewhere. If he talked with Yuliuke late at night about how the techniques of recent masters have improved, it was not with any malice or favoritism. Moreover, Baohua did not boast about being number one, so if Mr. Liu put himself in his place, would he not have said the same?</p>
<p>(3) Mr. Jiang's skill and experience have made great contributions to the country on many occasions, and he is praised by everyone. It would be shocking to place him below Mr. Zheng, but Mr. Zheng's recent improvement in tennis skills is indeed surprising. I believe you have also heard that Mr. Zhao Jiajun defeated Canadian Davis Cup player Mr. Duff in Lushan Guling. I suppose private discussions are also subject to criticism.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Lin Shufen</p>

<h3 id="e118">The National Government Disaster Relief Committee Held a General Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Decided to Continue Issuing 1.4 Million in Relief Funds</p>
<p>Passed the Addition of 17 Standing Committee Members</p>
<p>The Regulations of Each Group Were Handed Over to the Standing Committee for Handling</p>
<p>The National Government Disaster Relief Committee held its first general meeting of members yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at the Central Bank on the Bund, adjourning at 5:10 PM. The details of the meeting are recorded below.</p>
<p>▲Committee Members Present The attendees included Chairman Song Ziwen, Committee Members Kong Xiangxi, Xu Shiying, Zhu Qinglan, Wang Zhen, Wang Xiaolai, Zhou Xiangxian, Cha Liangzhao, Liu Ruiheng, Zeng Rongfu, Zheng Yuxiu, Shi Liangcai, Song Hanzhang, Lin Kanghou, Zhang Gongquan, Yu Qiaqing, Zhang Yuanshan, Baker, Ma Xier, Carney, and others, totaling over 80 people.</p>

<p>▲List of Standing Committee Members Song Ziwen, Kong Xiangxi, Xu Shiying, Zhu Qinglan, Liu Shangqing, Zhang Gongquan, Yu Qiaqing, Zeng Rongfu, Liu Ruiheng, Zheng Yuxiu, Baker, Ma Xier, Carney, Funatsu Tatsuo, Kanai Kiyoshi, Lu Benting, Ma Su,</p>
<p>▲Mr. Song's Report Honorable Committee Members, today is the first general meeting of this committee. I would like to take this opportunity to report to you on the official establishment of this committee and the work that has already been done. I would also like to briefly outline my humble views on the future work plan for your consideration. The severity of the disaster in the affected areas, beyond the Jianghuai River basin, need not be elaborated upon. As of today, scientific and detailed reports on the disaster situation in the disaster areas are still not available. The National Government, recognizing the seriousness of the situation, has established this committee to handle disaster relief matters and is responsible for raising large amounts of funds and purchasing large quantities of grain for disaster relief purposes. It is estimated that the committee will spend over 70 million national currency in total for disaster relief, including both cash and grain. Today, most of you, with a few exceptions, do not have much experience in disaster relief affairs. Or, the entire audience has never experienced such an unprecedented relief effort. The magnitude of this disaster is rare in history, and the relief strategies cannot be rigidly adhered to old methods, but must seek long-term measures that are adapted to the times. The questions before us today are what problems we face and what plans we should have. The victims are in urgent need of help, and all problems are complex. What we should pay attention to is that all plans should not be empty and unrealistic. Today, there are many discussions on disaster relief strategies, such as dredging the Huai River and improving the Yangtze River waterway. Their arguments are certainly appealing, but in reality, whether both are carried out simultaneously or one is carried out first, the funds required will be in the hundreds of millions. Regardless of whether this committee can obtain this huge amount of money at one time, even if the huge amount of money is fully collected, the engineering technology will not be sufficient. In the past, the United States of America suffered from floods in the Mississippi River for a long time. The cost of river management before and after was no less than hundreds of millions of dollars, but it still failed to permanently eliminate its disaster. The Mississippi River is short and small, far inferior to the Yangtze River. The manpower and financial resources spent were like that, but it still failed to make it obey. It can be seen how easy it is to talk about improving the Yangtze River waterway. So, what is the purpose of this committee? According to the results of the exchange of opinions among the groups of this committee, our answer to this question is roughly as follows: First, do our best to provide emergency relief to the victims, prioritize the distribution of food, build shelters, and prepare for sanitation and epidemic prevention. Second, wait until the floodwaters recede slightly and immediately repair the dikes to restore them to their original state. Although we have very little knowledge of water conservancy, such a large flood will cost an unlimited amount of money, and the dikes built will be extremely strong, but they will still not be able to resist this flood. This is generally recognized by various experts. Therefore, given the committee's limited financial resources, we can only plan to repair the old dikes or build new dikes so that they will not cause disasters under normal rainfall. What is said above does not mean that the National Government will never have specific and large-scale plans to dredge rivers in the future, but what this committee can do today is not enough to talk about this. Third, the committee should purchase and store grain seeds in advance, and distribute them to the victims after the floodwaters recede to be used for spring plowing next year, and at any time assist in the work of restoring farmland to its original state. We are ashamed that the above-mentioned proposals are simple, but even this simple plan is difficult for the committee's financial resources to cope with. However, we have to be down-to-earth and simplify things due to poverty, so the difficulties in this should be understood by the Chinese people. In order for the committee's work to proceed immediately, the five committee members initially appointed by the committee have assigned the directors of each group as follows: Zeng Rongpu is the director of the Investigation Group, Zhu Qinglan is the director of the Disaster Area Work Group, I will serve as the director of the Finance Group, Zhang Jiaju is the director of the Accounting and Audit Group, Yu Qiaqing is the director of the Transportation Group, Liu Ruiheng is the director of the Surgery and Hygiene Group, and Kong Xiangxi is the director of the Liaison Group. The gentlemen listed above are probably known to all of you present. When the candidates for the directors of each group were initially determined, although they all declined due to insufficient talent and ability, it was difficult to recruit responsible people for a time. After repeated persuasion, they each agreed to take responsibility. The detailed list of each group has long been issued by the committee and disclosed in various newspapers. Secondly, we should solemnly express our gratitude to all Chinese and foreigners who have generously donated funds. Although the government is doing its best to raise funds, the public funds obtained are still insufficient. To relieve the crisis and alleviate the difficulties, we rely on the support of the masses. This time, in the country, the amount of donations from groups and individuals received by this committee and other disaster relief organizations is unprecedented, and the courage to donate is rare. Abroad, even in the midst of economic depression and sluggish industries, the assistance and sympathy from all parties has not diminished. Within the first week after the establishment of the committee, the donations received totaled 1,044,580 yuan and 61,794 taels of silver (the amount of silver in this newspaper on the 3rd was incorrect, and is corrected here). Thereafter, there have been many successive donations. It is estimated that private donations will still reach several million yuan, and it is hoped that they will come in steadily. The Finance Group, Accounting and Audit Group, and Disaster Area Work Group have proposed that, in addition to the 1 million yuan in relief funds temporarily allocated by the National Government last time, 1.4 million yuan should be immediately allocated to the following provinces: Hubei 400,000 yuan, Anhui 300,000 yuan, Jiangsu 300,000 yuan, Jiangxi 100,000 yuan, Hunan 100,000 yuan, Henan 100,000 yuan, and medical expenses 100,000 yuan, totaling 1.4 million yuan. In addition, this committee has also received a donation of food and supplies worth 300,000 Japanese yen from the Japan Flood Relief Association, and it is now planned to distribute the items as follows: (1) Rice and flour should be distributed in Hubei. (2) Blankets and milk should be stored and used by the Medical Group. After my report, I would like to invite the Director of the Disaster Area Work Group, the Director of the Health and Epidemic Prevention Group, the Director of the Accounting and Audit Group, and the representatives of the Engineering Department to give a simple report on the work of their respective departments. Before I finish my report, I would like to offer a few more words for our common encouragement. The public words of Chinese and foreign disaster relief experts say that the difficulty of disaster relief is not on the day when the disaster first forms, but after the disaster continues and the disaster victims are in the most difficult situation. It is not in the extremely enthusiastic period of the disaster, but on the day when the disaster sound gradually subsides. When the disaster first forms, the victims may have a little surplus grain, and the enthusiastic calls from the society and the enthusiastic donations from local charitable organizations are enough to save the hungry and drowning for a time. However, as time passes, autumn ends and winter comes, the days are cold and the nights are long, and ice and snow cover the ground. The voice of social disaster relief has gradually subsided, and the donations from local charities have been almost exhausted. Only at this time is the function of this committee the most important and the disaster victims' hope for us is the most urgent. Therefore, given the status of this committee today, if we save a little surplus money in the early stage of disaster relief, people will regard it as having other intentions. However, if we exhaust all our resources and use them all at one time today, people may later criticize us for being shortsighted. After repeated deliberations, we have first drafted an estimate of expenses for the next six months for your consideration: (Disaster Relief Expenses Estimate) Wheat (relief and work relief) 37,500,000 yuan, transportation costs (including warehouse, insurance, and packaging fees) 12,000,000 yuan, disaster relief work expenses (including dike construction materials, equipment, workshops, supervision, and temporary shelters) 10,000,000 yuan, winter clothing for disaster victims 3,500,000 yuan, health work 1,000,000 yuan, emergency expenses already paid 1,000,000 yuan, reserve fund 5,000,000 yuan, totaling 70,000,000 yuan.</p>
<p>▲Gong County Begs for Relief The National Government Disaster Relief Committee received a report yesterday that the flood in Gong County, Henan Province, has spread over 600 square miles, and about 10,000 people are homeless. There is an urgent need for relief grain and medicine to be transported to the area to meet the emergency needs.</p>
<p>▲Denmark Donates Medicine Chairman Song of the National Government Disaster Relief Committee announced yesterday that the Danish government has donated a large number of typhoid and cholera (cholera) vaccines for the use of refugees in the disaster area. The Relief Committee has gratefully received and thanked them. The telegram was sent by the Danish Minister to China, Mr. Gao Fuke, and contained a telegram of condolences for the disaster, which stated: To Chairman Song of the Disaster Relief Committee, the people of our country are saddened by the disastrous flood in the Yangtze River basin. Our government is willing to provide assistance to the disaster within its capacity. I have been specially instructed to inquire whether your disaster area currently needs typhoid and cholera vaccines to prevent epidemics. It is now planned that the Danish Serum Institute will provide typhoid and cholera vaccines for 100,000 people. This medicine can be shipped out of Siberia within two weeks after consultation with Dr. Madsen, the director of the institute and chairman of the Health Committee of the League of Nations. Please reply immediately and indicate the place of arrival.</p>
<p>▲Japanese Personnel Coming to China The National Government Disaster Relief Committee has learned that Duke Tokugawa, President of the Japanese Red Cross Society, has now dispatched representatives to China to express condolences for the flood disaster and bring 30,000 Japanese yen in relief funds.</p>

<p>Replies to General Commander Chiang and Deputy Commander Zhang by Telegram</p>
<p>Calling for the Cessation of Civil War to Save the Nation from Danger</p>
<p>The Municipal Party Headquarters Executive Committee has been receiving telegrams from General Commander Chiang and Deputy Commander Zhang for several days. Yesterday, it was reported to the meeting and it was resolved to reply separately by telegram. It is understood that these telegrams have already been drafted and sent. The content is quite important. The original text is recorded below:</p>
<p>▲Reply to General Commander Chiang by Telegram To Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, National Government, Nanjing,</p>
<p>Your telegram expressing love for peace and concern for the nation, taking responsibility with courage and reprimanding yourself with utmost sincerity, has deeply moved and inspired us. In recent years, our country has been plagued by successive rebellions, frequent wars, rampant Red bandits, and foreign aggression. In addition, water, drought, hail, and successive disasters have occurred. The melons of Huangtai are picked again and again, and the national crisis has reached its extreme. In these difficult times, all of us who are alive and have a sense of righteousness should cut our hair and put on our armor, unite as one, and work together to save the nation. We should pool our wisdom and efforts to reverse the decline. If there are still disloyal party members, shameless politicians, and domineering soldiers who only know their own selfish interests and disregard the happiness of the whole, attempting to cause chaos and recklessly starting wars, not hesitating to inflict suffering on the disaster victims and destroy the foundation of the nation, then they are traitors to the party and the country, and everyone has the right to punish them. We earnestly hope that comrades will uphold their original aspirations, exert their remaining courage, and take swift action to condemn and punish them. Only then can all obstacles be removed, peace be permanently maintained, and the future of the nation truly depend on it.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang</p>
<p>Qi</p>
<p>▲Reply to Deputy Commander Zhang by Telegram To Deputy Commander Zhang Xueliang, Beiping,</p>
<p>We have just received your telegram advocating for weighing the advantages and disadvantages and saving the nation from danger. Your benevolent words are widely beneficial and deeply admired. At this time when the country is in danger of being destroyed and the people are in pain of being submerged, cutting our hair and putting on our armor is still insufficient. What is the intention of observing soldiers and flaunting military power? Even if it is said to be patriotism, the country should be the premise. If it is to save the people, the people should be the mission. If the fratricide cannot resist foreign aggression and the people in the same room only know how to wield swords, it is patriotism in name but harming the country in reality, and saving the people in the beginning but harming the people in the end. There is absolutely no way to succeed by harming the country and harming the people through perverse acts. As for political views that occasionally differ and personnel matters that are not without remedy, the party has discipline and the country has laws. By using laws and discipline to restrain each other, what disputes are there to speak of? If we disregard the national economy and the people's livelihood and only seek to resolve old grievances, it is tantamount to cutting ourselves off from the country and abandoning ourselves to the people. There is no way to survive if we cut ourselves off from the country and abandon ourselves to the people. Moreover, the melons of Huangtai are picked again and again, and there is no complete egg under the overturned nest. It is advisable to move the firewood early to prevent a fire. We hope that you will thoroughly implement your proposals, promote harmony, and the national interest and the people's happiness will depend on it.</p>

<p>More Disaster Victims Arrive in Shanghai</p>
<p>The Shanghai Disaster Victim Reception Center in Nanshi has completely vacated the guild halls and temples in Nanshi where disaster victims were staying in Shanghai and merged them all into the Chao Hui Villa and Qu Zhenren Temple. Yesterday, some Hubei and Gao Shao disaster victims stranded in Shanghai reported to the center, as they did not know about the reception center after arriving in Shanghai. There were 14 disaster victims from Hankou, Gaoyou, and Shaobo. The center arranged to accommodate them all in the Chao Hui Villa.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 7:00 PM, a train from Wuxi brought 32 refugees from Jiujiang. Leader Yu Shunbai reported to the 5th District Public Security Bureau and temporarily stayed in the district before going to Hangzhou.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Jiangsu Flood Relief Association News <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>▲Disaster Survey Report: Mr. Liu Cheng, a disaster survey specialist from the association, reported on the disaster situation in Liyang as follows: (Disaster Area) The county is low-lying with no water storage areas. Approximately 700,000 mu of farmland were affected, accounting for eight-tenths of the county's total land. (Disaster Victims) Thousands of people were displaced and fled to other towns or sought work as laborers in various cities. More than 2,000 people died. (Post-Disaster) Although the water has gradually receded, the low-lying areas still resemble vast rivers and lakes. In particular, Yuan Wan in District 2, Gu Du Lanxi in District 7, and Hutang Langwei in District 8 are like cauldrons, with the deepest water. Residents, young and old, are crying from hunger and cold, and those entering the city awaiting relief are constantly on the road. Even in higher areas, the crops have almost completely rotted, making replanting impossible. The collapsed houses and injured people along the breached dikes are too numerous to count. (Cause of Disaster) Since summer, there has been continuous rain and subsequent hurricanes. Mountain floods erupted, and river water rose sharply. Embanked and tidal farmland were successively submerged. (Spring Harvest) The total harvest for the entire county is estimated at only 22%.</p>
<p>▲Summary of Telegrams from Various Offices: Zhu Zhongjian in Gaoyou telegraphed that he has been rescuing more than 1,000 refugees daily. Among them, eight-tenths are willing to move south, and two-tenths are being accommodated. The post office is overcrowded with people staying overnight and eating, and rice, flour, and boats are insufficient. He requested that they be dispatched quickly. Cao Songqiao and Yuan Xiaogu in Yangzhou telegraphed that five shelters have been set up and are full, making it difficult to accommodate more people. Many more people are coming, so please quickly find a solution and another location. Hua Fuxian in Sishui telegraphed that 800 refugees have been sheltered up to the fishing day. He also telegraphed that 1,000 people are sheltered in Yanggeng, and those who want to leave are dismissed, with 600 people actually sheltered, mostly women and children.</p>
<p>▲Summary of Telegrams from Various Counties and Organizations: Gao Henian in Xinghua telegraphed that the Gao Shao Dike has breached, turning the eastern part of Taizhou, Xinghua, Yancheng, and Funing into a watery expanse, especially Xinghua. The water level has stopped rising and is increasing. He has urgently telegraphed the provincial government to quickly block the breach. Li Yushu in Huaiyin telegraphed that the disaster area in Huai's Siyang is vast, and there are many disaster victims. The Jisheng Society's relief funds are insufficient to distribute. He urgently requests further arrangements to dispatch personnel and relief supplies, preferably No. 4 or 5 flour, requiring 10,000 bags per county with strict inspection and generous distribution. Jiang Zhongxiang in Nanjing telegraphed that the Pu Zhen (Pukou relief) has been allocated 10,000 yuan, and a local meeting will be convened immediately to proceed. The Ning Yu Zhen (Ning Yu relief) is actively raising funds, and a detailed telegram will follow. Zhang Suijing in Yangzhou telegraphed that he received a letter instructing the allocation of 10,000 yuan for the purchase of 5,000 bags of flour, which have been shipped to Zhenjiang. He is grateful, but requests that the Yangzhou government send personnel to distribute it, as they are unfamiliar with the area and it is inconvenient. He still requests the association to take charge of the matter.</p>
<p>▲Continued Reports of Disaster Conditions from Various Counties: The magistrate of Yancheng County telegraphed that the water level in Yancheng rose sharply by two feet in two days, with the water depth in the plains exceeding ten feet. Except for a small area in the city, almost the entire county, hundreds of miles, is submerged. They are currently accommodating refugees separately and have dispatched committee members to provide relief in various townships. He urgently requests five steamships and a telegraphic transfer of 40,000 to 50,000 yuan for relief to save lives. Dai Hanwen in Funing telegraphed that the water depth in the plains in the southeast townships of Funing County is three to four feet, and it is still rising rapidly, with dire consequences. Furthermore, the old Yellow River dikes at the Meng and Er locations in the north of the county have also collapsed, inundating a significant amount of farmland and houses. They are currently accommodating and providing relief, but the disaster is severe and the relief is meager. He still requests a substantial increase in funds to save the disaster victims. The Dongtai Qian Budian Tobacco and South Goods Trade Association telegraphed that the Yun Dike has breached, causing the city to rise three feet, with water on all sides, halting all industries. The situation in the countryside, where houses are submerged, is even more dire. Millions of disaster victims are crying out for food. The relief funds allocated are a drop in the bucket. They urgently plead for a large amount of grain and funds to save the survivors. Han Xiyu, Ling Dichun, and others, difficult refugees in Taixian, stated that the water level is approaching the city day by day. They have blocked the Xin Guan (New Customs) North Gate, and the remaining gates and water gates are being prepared for blocking. The city is overcrowded, and food is running out. They heard that another five or six feet of water is coming, causing several alarms every night. In the four rural areas, cooking smoke has ceased, the sound of chickens and dogs is unheard, houses are drifting away, and the stench of floating corpses is unbearable. The relief funds issued by the province have long been exhausted. If funds are not continuously allocated, those who have been saved will eventually die.</p>
<p>▲Association Affairs News: The association originally scheduled a meeting of the entire executive committee for the 10th of this month. It has been learned that due to a conflict in time and location with the Fundraising Association for the Flood Disaster in Various Provinces, it has been changed to 4:00 PM on the 11th. All executive committee and standing committee members have been notified separately. Qiao Baoyuan, the association's disaster survey specialist and director of the Tongshan Emergency Relief, arrived in Shanghai on the Beijing-Shanghai train yesterday afternoon to discuss various relief matters. It is heard that Mr. Qiao's health has not yet recovered, and he looks very thin. His voice is also weak. The Jiangsu Association of Fellow Provincials in Beijing organized the Flood Disaster Emergency Relief Association and appointed Wu Jingheng, Niu Yongjian, Sun Bowen, and Zhang Yiou as standing committee members and representatives to come to Shanghai for discussions. Mr. Sun Bowen arrived at the association yesterday with official documents for consultation. It is heard that Mr. Wu, Niu, and Zhang will also arrive in Shanghai successively.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Jisheng Society's Handling of Jiangsu Relief <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Jisheng Society, given the unprecedented disaster this time, has promised to do its best in all severely affected areas and will promptly appoint directors to go for relief. The flood disaster in Jiangsu Province is no less severe than in Wuhan, such as Gaoyou and Shaobo, which are indeed unprecedented tragedies. The association publicly appointed Committee Member Zhang Xianqing, along with relief friends, to carry 30,000 yuan and 15,000 bags of flour. In addition, 2,000 bags were shipped from the Zhenjiang Yicheng Factory, totaling 17,000 bags. More will be shipped afterward, along with 32 boxes of biscuits and 6 boxes of relief medicine. Due to the extraordinarily severe disaster situation, Relief Friends Mu Jialiang and Sun Yinting were added to assist in handling the matter. For Huaiyin, Huaian, and Siyang counties, the society publicly appointed Zhou Yuankai and Li Yushu, the president and vice president of the Qingjiang Jisheng Branch, along with relief friends, to handle the distribution. The association allocated and remitted 20,000 yuan for relief, which was transferred to Qingjiang Yichang Zhuang through Dade Zhuang the day before yesterday. Five thousand bags of flour were also shipped in batches for relief. Reports continued to come from Xinghua, Dongtai, Yancheng, and other places, indicating that the disaster situation was even more severe. The society is currently lacking both personnel and funds, and although they have the desire to save people, they can only lament helplessly.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Gaoyou Refugees Cry Out the Reasons for the Disaster <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Elders and fathers throughout the country, please be aware: Gaoyou has suffered from continuous rain this summer, and the suffering of farmers in low-lying areas has been extreme. As the Yi and Huai rivers rose and flowed into Gaobao Lake, the canal level reached 1 zhang 8 chi 7 cun. The dams were released to discharge water into the sea, and our county bore the brunt. All the embankments in the county were submerged. Agricultural products flowered but did not bear fruit, and tens of thousands of people died. Fortunately, the urban area could somewhat accommodate refugees. After autumn, the canal water level dropped slightly, and it was said that a part of the urban area had barely escaped with their lives. Who would have expected that on August 25th, a hurricane roared, and the water surged. At dusk, the city was flooded. The authorities were unable to take emergency measures and resorted to digging a well when thirsty. The loose soil could not withstand the water pressure, causing breaches in critical locations successively from 3:00 AM to 5:00 AM on August 26th, from Dangjun Tower in the north to Qigong Temple in the south, a length of about two li. The two sections in the middle that did not collapse were only about ten or twenty zhang each, forming isolated islands. The area outside the North Gate became a watery expanse, houses drifted, and countless old and young, men and women, drowned in the water. Corpses floated everywhere, almost like mountains. Those who were fortunate enough not to drown either climbed onto rooftops or treetops for help, or went to high ground or mounds to await rescue. The sound of crying corresponded to the sound of waves, a sight unbearable to see and a sound unbearable to hear. The urban area relied on the city walls for protection. This time, the city river water gate and the dam heads were weakly constructed and could not withstand the flood, causing backflow. Survivors are exposed to the elements and eating in the wind, becoming emaciated from starvation. The people of Gaoyou are innocent and have suffered this great calamity. Recalling the time of embankment protection, the provincial order instructed all water conservancy bureaus and county governments in the province to raise the subsidiary embankments by three chi. If the new embankment was strongly constructed and the materials were solid, it would have been able to withstand the floods. If the authorities had been responsible and conscientious, it would not have been difficult to eliminate the danger. However, the water conservancy bureau turned a blind eye and was unwilling to act, relying only on a small amount of silver collected by a certain chamber of commerce as a temporary fix. Although it is said to be a natural disaster, it was caused by humans. This is the first cause of the tragedy due to negligence. This year's flood disaster required a huge amount of expenditure. Blocking the downstream river and river mouth dam heads cost more than 4,400 yuan but still resulted in danger, requiring another 10,000 yuan for rescue. Blocking the Wanlv An Shuangmiao Diaoyugou three dams in the downstream required more than 12,200 yuan, which is not included in the previous expenditure. After the three dams in the upstream were blocked, the government was reluctant to spend money and perfunctorily increased the embankments, even shifting responsibility, so that the initiator was realistic and did not waste money when work began. How could it have reached the point where they were exhausted and had no rice to cook during the emergency rescue? This is the second cause of the tragedy due to dereliction of duty. Since the Republic, the spring repairs have always been funded with 800 yuan, which was already insufficient. This year, the deadline was missed, and only 5,000 yuan was issued. The bureau chiefs did not consider the importance of the matter and only issued money. According to records, during the Kangxi period of the Qing Dynasty, the Lotus Pond breached, and the city was surrounded by water, with the water only three chi from the city wall, yet the city was safe. This year, the blocking of the water gate and city gate was assigned to the government, with more funds than in the past, but the officials embezzled and enriched themselves, so that when the water reached the water gate, it immediately collapsed. This is the third cause of the tragedy due to corruption. Please investigate the causes of the disaster and punish the responsible persons according to the regulations of river affairs to serve as a warning for the future. This is what the helpless disaster victims hope from the national government and authorities. A tearful plea from the flood victims of Gaoyou County.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Xinghua Fellow Provincials Association Begs for Relief <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The Xinghua Fellow Provincials Association sent a letter to various charitable organizations in Shanghai to beg for relief, stating: Respected sirs, the land has sunk in a great calamity, a severe disaster in Xinghua. The area is remote, and news is cut off, so the situation is not known outside. According to refugees who have fled to Shanghai, weeping and wailing, the severity of the disaster is rarely seen in history books, and the urgency of the need for rescue cannot be described in words. Now, we will describe the actual situation of the disaster to your association in detail. Our county has frequent floods and droughts, and famines have continued for years. The people's livelihood has been declining for years. Since the flood disaster in 1921, the vitality has not yet recovered. In 1928 and 1929, drought and salinity overlapped, and 200,000 strong men went to seek a living elsewhere. Last year's autumn harvest was only 30% to 40%. The water village is not suitable for growing wheat, and the spring crop is very small. The only thing they hoped for was the autumn harvest. This year, from May 14th, it rained heavily, non-stop for more than ten days. Before the disaster in the Huai River, the ditches were already overflowing, and half of the fields had been flooded. Then, the Huai River rose sharply, and all three dams were opened. The water depth in the plains reached ten feet, and all the fields in the entire territory were submerged. It was five days before the autumn harvest. According to the custom in this area, early rice starts to turn yellow at the beginning of autumn. The green rice is not yet ripe, and even harvesting it would be useless. Thus, a year's hard work was completely ruined by the flood. The entire territory has 4 million mu of good farmland, and the harvest from each mu is worth about 20 yuan, totaling a loss of nearly 80 million yuan. The livelihood of 600,000 people is on the verge of extinction. The water continues to rise daily, and the houses are also several feet under water. The villages in the four rural areas are building new embankments to defend against the flood. Who would have expected that on the afternoon of August 26th, the Post and Shao dams breached, as if pouring the water of three lakes to sink a leaky boat? When the water reached Xinghua, the people of Xinghua were still dreaming. The water surged and rose several feet in an instant. Furthermore, the wind was strong, and the rain was heavy. The village embankments in the four rural areas collapsed by the hundreds and thousands. There were survivors clinging to tree tops and rooftops, and drowned ghosts of women and children floating in the waves. The sound of crying shook the sky and did not cease for hundreds of miles. The next day, when the water stabilized somewhat, those whose houses had collapsed immediately dismantled the pillars to nail piles, trying to reinforce and block desperately. But they could not succeed, and entire villages boarded boats. Before the Post and Shao dams breached, the Lao Embankment, Zhong Embankment, Yongfeng Embankment, and Heta Embankment in the northeast, as well as the Lao Embankment, Sanjiao Embankment, and Fire Dragon Embankment connecting to the damaged Yancheng, were still in good condition, although the water was close to the top of the embankment. The early rice had also been harvested. After the breach, the wind carried the water and surged, making it impossible to protect them, and they collapsed one after another. Houses, livestock, and newly harvested early rice were all swept away. From then on, in Xinghua, for more than a hundred li in all directions, there was not a single piece of dry land. The county seat, the highest point, was also half-submerged in water. Most of the houses outside the city were washed away. The only thing they relied on was a lone city wall. To this day, the breach in the Yun Embankment has not yet been completely blocked, and the water level continues to rise by two or three inches every day. If this continues to accumulate, even this lone city will be submerged, which is only a matter of time. In this Jianghuai flood disaster, apart from Post and Shao being the most directly affected, Xingtai, Dongtai, Yancheng, and Funing are the most severely affected among the five counties. Among the five counties, Xinghua is the most severely affected because it is adjacent to Gaoyou and was flooded first. The terrain is the lowest, the water is deepest, the downstream drainage is poor, the water storage is the widest, and the water recedes the slowest. In the past, there was a saying that Hong Lake moved east, and now it has come true. Xinghua has completely become the bottom of the lake, while other counties are still on the edge of the lake. When winter arrives, the starving will have no food, and the cold will have no clothing. If hundreds of thousands of disaster victims barely clinging to life are not provided with relief, they will all die afterward. In previous famine years, farmers went to Jiangnan to find food. This year, Suzhou, Changzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou are also severely affected by the disaster. Now, even this place to find food is no longer available. The old and weak are sitting and waiting to die, while the strong are taking risks. Those who do not die from water will die from hunger, and those who do not die from hunger will die from robbery. The difficulties ahead are unimaginable. Since the breach, although we have received assistance from various sectors, the amount received is limited, like adding wood to a burning fire or dripping water on a burning mountain. The people are suffering more from the burning. We look north to the clouds, our souls fly away, and our intestines are broken. We use these urgent words to beg your association to increase the allocation of relief funds to relieve the suffering of those on the verge of death and save the lives of those about to drown. The Xinghua Fellow Provincials Association kowtows.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Dongtai Fellow Provincials Report Disaster Conditions <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The Dongtai Fellow Provincials Association in Shanghai received news of the Dongtai flood disaster yesterday. At present, the relatively high urban area is besieged by floodwaters. Houses near the river are completely submerged, with depths of seven or eight feet. Even the highest county government front gate and second gate are flooded, so another back door has been opened on Main Street (Dongtai Main Street, which spans the Fan Embankment) to facilitate entry and exit. Main streets such as He Duo, Sanli Bridge, Magong Bridge, Xinba, and Caiyi Street are a foot deep in water. In the past, these were the most prosperous commercial areas, with a constant stream of pedestrians. Now, they are unusually deserted. The area near the North and South City Roots, Lujiatan, and the rural areas where refugees have come to the city are all borrowing ancient temples for accommodation. The number of arrivals increases daily, making it difficult to accommodate them, and there is a risk of starvation. However, many relief organizations have not yet arrived. We hope that all relief officials will pay special attention, knowing that saving from water is like saving from fire.</p>
<h3 id="e126">China Foreign Famine Relief Commission Disaster Relief Work <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>▲Overseas Chinese Enthusiastically Contribute: Overseas Chinese in various places are concerned about the flood disaster in their homeland and have constantly remitted large sums of money to Shanghai. Yesterday, the China Foreign Famine Relief Commission received (1) 10,000 yuan in foreign currency remitted by overseas Chinese in Surabaya, Java; (2) 2,000 taels of silver remitted by overseas Chinese in Semarang; (3) 80 pounds in English gold remitted by overseas Chinese in Shetland.</p>
<p>▲Xu Wenzhao Uses Award Money to Help Relief: The Western Medicine Department of the Lao Jinlong Foreign Company advertised for slogans for Yan Yisheng's Red Blood Pills and Tonic Pills. The first prize was 100 yuan, which was won by Mr. Xu Wenzhao of the Shanghai Central Trust Company. Mr. Xu immediately donated the award money to the China Foreign Famine Relief Commission to be used for flood relief in various places. Furthermore, the members of the Shanghai Cotton Cloth Trade Association, Yuchun Fengji, raised 2,500 yuan in foreign currency from the Luan Chang Company, which was also sent to the commission yesterday for relief.</p>
<p>▲Xinghua Branch Reports on Work: Yesterday, the commission received a report from the Xinghua Branch stating that Xinghua is shaped like a cauldron, and the disaster situation is extremely severe. The branch is currently distributing bread and flour to the most distressed areas and is building straw sheds on streets in the city without water to accommodate disaster victims. However, most of the streets are knee-deep in water, making the work very difficult. In the water-affected areas outside Xinghua City, disaster victims are still gathering on rooftops, and there is a risk of collapse at any time, which means that these people will be buried in the bellies of fish. However, these disaster victims are still attached to their homeland and do not want to leave. It is predicted that the water will not recede completely until at least three months later, so the idea of replanting is a pipe dream. By that time, it will already be winter, and the suffering of disaster victims from hunger and cold is only just beginning.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Continued Reports of Flood Disasters in Various Counties of Anhui <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>

<h3 id="e128">Report from Special Commissioners Sent to Anhui for Relief <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Xu Guozhi and Liu Lingsheng, dispatched by the Emergency Relief Association to Anhui for emergency relief, sent a telegram yesterday reporting on the relief situation in Anhui.</p>
<p>▲Telegram 1: Respected members of Renji Hall, Jiang telegram instructed to distribute 1,500 yuan for emergency relief in Yingshang County for the Flood Disaster Relief Association of fellow Jiangsu and Anhui natives. I have complied with the instructions. After the funds were remitted, I, along with the Tianjin funds, handed them over to the Yingshang County government to entrust Mr. Yu Youquan in Bengbu, who is from Yingshang, to remit them to Yingshang, and then accompanied relief friends to distribute them in Yingshang and Wuhe. Xu Guozhi kowtows, tiny.</p>
<p>▲Telegram 2: Investigating the disaster victims at Linhuai Pass, 20,000 have been sent across the border, and only 8,000 have reached the east. There are more arrivals, and emergency relief must take into account both local people and those crossing the border to start.

Yesterday, they sent a letter to Magistrate Wang of Gaoyou County, stating that our association, not shirking our meager contribution, has raised 1,000 bags of flour and arranged for shipment to assist in emergency relief. We earnestly request the magistrate to inspect and promptly distribute them.</p>
<p>▲Marine Engineers' Flood Relief Association Established: The China Federation of Marine Engineers held a Flood Relief Association yesterday. Xu Linxun, Lin Jiazhou, Wang Qingfeng, Zhang Wenxing, Zhang Guixuan, Li Liansheng, Li Yuncheng, Sun Xinfen, and 50 other people attended. Xu Linxun was publicly elected as chairman. A ceremony was held, and the meeting elected (3) Xu Linxun, Lin Jiazhou, Wang Qingfeng, and Li Liansheng as executive committee members; (4) Xu Linxun and Lin Jiazhou as standing committee members for relief; (5) Sun Xin was appointed as the captain of the fundraising team to command the team members; (6) eight team members were assigned and divided into two teams; (7) fundraising members will solicit donations from marine engineers daily after receiving the donation register; (8) the donated funds will be submitted to the standing committee members daily for storage in a designated bank; (9) the fundraising period is tentatively set for three months; (10) no fundraising is allowed along the road; (11) the names of the donors will be published in the newspaper after the fundraising is completed.</p>
<p>▲30,000 Street Vendors in Shanghai Rise Up to Join Forces for Relief: Street vendors Liu Bingfu, Bao Lianqing, Tu Yunliang, Li Dongsheng, and others organized the Shanghai Jiang Municipal Street Vendor Industry Savings Association in 1924, with no less than several thousand members. Together with non-member colleagues in Shanghai, there are approximately 30,000 people. Due to the extraordinarily severe national flood disaster this time, and neighboring countries have also contributed funds for relief, although street vendors are small businesses, but for the sake of compatriots, they cannot bear to sit idly by. Therefore, the original initiators Tang Xiaobao and others invited colleagues to discuss and decided to jointly unite all street vendors in Shanghai to donate as much as possible, and appointed representatives to consult Yu Qiaqing, Fang Jiaobo, and others for support. On one hand, the initiators will strictly organize and establish sound measures, and separately order donation registers, affixing seals, and assign honest street vendors to solicit donations at various vegetable markets. The donation collectors will issue receipts and submit them daily to Liu Bingfu of Taihe Fish Market on Xiaodongmen Main Street for safekeeping. When the amount has accumulated, it will be transferred to the Emergency Relief Associations of various provinces and remitted to the disaster areas, and the initiators will publish a statement in the newspaper to ensure transparency.</p>

<h3 id="e132">Chu Minyi Returned to Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>The French Delegation Still Remains in the Provincial Capital of Xinjiang</p>
<p>The True Situation of the Sino-French Dispute</p>
<p>A Detailed Report Will Be Given in Beijing Soon</p>
<p>He Will Return to His Ancestral Home Next Week to Attend the Funeral</p>
<p>Mr. Chu Minyi, a member of the Central Committee, was previously dispatched by the Central Government to Xinjiang to investigate party affairs and also served as the head of the Chinese side of the Sino-French Academic Investigation Team. He went to various places in the Northwest for on-the-spot investigations. Unfortunately, a dispute occurred midway, and the National Government ordered the cessation of the investigation. After receiving the order in Dihua, Mr. Chu immediately returned to China via Russia, taking the China Eastern Railway southward. He arrived in Shanghai by overnight express train from Beijing yesterday morning. Our reporter interviewed him at the Sino-French Industrial School yesterday. Mr. Chu looked grief-stricken due to mourning his father, and travel-worn, but his spirits were still very high. According to Mr. Chu,</p>
<p>▲Attending the Report</p>
<p>I (Chu, referring to himself) arrived in Beijing yesterday morning (i.e., the morning before yesterday), stayed for half a day, and did not meet with Chairman Chiang. I took a train back to Shanghai that evening to take care of school and family matters. I plan to go to Beijing next Monday to attend the Central Party Headquarters' Memorial Week and report in detail the whole story of the dispute of the Sino-French Investigation Team, etc. Yesterday, Chu sent a telegram to the Central Government, saying: "To the Secretariat of the Central Party Headquarters in Nanjing, for the information of all committee members, Minyi was ordered to go to Xinjiang and has now completed the inspection. I left Dihua on the 11th of last month and returned to Shanghai via Russia to attend the funeral. As soon as family and school matters are settled, I will come to Beijing to report on the inspection situation. Furthermore, the dispute in the Sino-French Academic Team during the journey has caused many misunderstandings due to the delay in letters and telegrams. In addition to the report already made to the Antiquities Preservation Committee in Beiping, it is still necessary to make a supplementary explanation in person. I hereby report this in advance. Chu Minyi respectfully bows."</p>
<p>▲Achievements of the Crawling Vehicles</p>
<p>Mr. Chu then said that the Sino-French Scientific Investigation Team of 1920 was divided into East and West teams to enter Xinjiang. The West Team was entirely organized by the French, entering Xinjiang via Asia Minor, with Mr. Halde as the head. The East Team, i.e., my team, was a joint team of Chinese and French, with myself as the Chinese team leader and Mr. Bouan, the assailant, as the French team leader. We departed from Beiping, passing through Xi'an, Lanzhou, Suzhou, and Hami, and arrived in Dihua, totaling five legs, each with 18 stations, each station being approximately 90 li. Normally, each station would take a day to travel. It should have taken four months from Zhangjiakou to Dihua, but because we used crawling vehicles, we departed from Zhangjiakou on May 17th and arrived in Dihua on July 7th, taking only 50 days. Excluding the 15 days of delay on the way, it actually took 35 days, truly opening a new era in Xinjiang transportation.</p>
<p>▲Advantages and Disadvantages of the Crawling Vehicles</p>
<p>However, the crawling vehicles have both advantages and disadvantages. The advantage is that the wheels do not sink in when driving in the desert, allowing for free movement. The disadvantage is that the speed is too slow when driving inland. I have drafted an improvement plan for the future development of Xinjiang transportation.</p>
<p>▲The Reality of the Dispute</p>
<p>As for the course of this dispute, the French team leader, Mr. Bouan, acted improperly and even beat our team member, Hao Jingsheng. At that time, the Chinese team members were very angry and gathered in Suzhou on June 15th to negotiate with the French side and requested the local government to stop the investigation. At that time, Mr. Hao and Mr. Zhou and Mr. Han had already withdrawn. However, our side also telegraphed the National Government to report, but the telegram arrived too late, causing misunderstandings among the people in the mainland. In fact, at that time, we were also unwilling to cooperate with the French side. Later, with the mediation of Ma Hongbin, the chairman of the 20 provinces, we signed seven conditions with the French side (i.e., the removal of Bouan and other seven conditions) before continuing the journey. We left Suzhou on June 21st, traveled west, arrived in Hami, Xinjiang Province on June 27th, arrived in Turpan on July 5th, and arrived in Dihua on July 7th, where we received the first order from the National Government to stop the investigation. Soon after, we received an order to prohibit the investigation and protect the French team members. We immediately obeyed the order and stopped the investigation. I and the Chinese team members then departed from Russia and returned to China. This trip covered more than 25,000 li. Although the dispute caused an impact, the investigation results and images seen were excellent.</p>
<p>▲The French Delegation Stays in Xinjiang</p>
<p>The reason why the Chinese delegation returned first and the French delegation remained in Xinjiang Province is that the French side had to wait for the arrival of the West Team before returning to China. However, investigations are now prohibited in Xinjiang Province. Beforehand, the Xinjiang Provincial Government originally planned to order the French delegation to stay in Turpan temporarily. Later, due to Bouan's repeated requests, they were allowed to stay in Dihua. Bouan also sent a letter of apology to the Xinjiang Provincial Government, which has not been published by any newspapers. The following is a transcript: "(To Chairman, with respect, this letter is to inform you that during the desert trip of our delegation, Bouan had a conflict with Mr. Hao Jingsheng, a member of your delegation, over trivial matters, which led to reckless use of force. After thinking about it, I feel very inappropriate. Last night, Your Excellency ordered Bouan to stay in the provincial capital pending orders. Due to my impatience, I wanted to leave without thinking, which was extremely absurd. Bouan is young and inexperienced. In addition, I am carrying the mission of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of our country. The people who came with me between staying in Turpan were visiting your country for the first time. I felt uneasy about abandoning them in the hot city of Turpan. Dr. Chu Minyi and General Yao Xijiu had many acquaintances among my friends and relatives in our country. They know Bouan's personality better. Therefore, I hope that Your Excellency will be extra lenient on the above two major mistakes and temporarily allow Bouan to stay with the members of our delegation in Turpan to await your orders. If this is approved, please send someone to accompany the vehicle, and Bouan will never dare to take any improper actions.)"</p>
<p>▲One Member of the Chinese Delegation</p>
<p>The entire Chinese delegation had a total of eight people. Except for Mr. Hao and the other two who withdrew midway, there were six people who arrived in Dihua. I and the other five returned together. Only Mr. Liu Shenchan, a botanist sent by the Academia Sinica, decided to stay longer for more investigation because it was not easy to reach Xinjiang. Therefore, only one member of the Chinese delegation remained in Xinjiang.</p>
<p>▲Northwest Transportation</p>
<p>After this investigation, we have a general understanding of the situation in the Northwest. In terms of party affairs, although the Central Government has not officially recognized it, there is a lot of party work and the dissemination of the Three Principles of the People has been going on for a long time. In terms of society, the people can be said to be extremely simple and honest. In terms of politics, the organization of the Xinjiang Provincial Government is the same as the central establishment, with four departments for civil affairs, finance, construction, and education, and a secretary-general. However, since the establishment of the provincial government, there has never been a provincial government meeting, which is somewhat different from other places. The most important thing is transportation, and Russia's attempt to invade Xinjiang is particularly worrying. The transportation between Xinjiang Province and the mainland is extremely obstructed. Usually, all exports are made by Russia, which leads to Russia's monopoly. Now, Soviet Russia is planning a railway branch line from Ayakoz of the Turkestan–Siberia Railway to Tacheng. Once completed, it will be a matter of arrival in the evening after departure in the morning. Not only will the southern industry be completely absorbed, but the border issue is also worrying. At present, to save everything in Xinjiang, we must start by opening up transportation. In the past, there were three routes from the country to Xinjiang: one from Suiyuan to Guchengzi, which is the shortest, only taking seventy or eighty days, but it is very dangerous because it passes through the desert; one from Beiping to Hami, passing through Xi'an, Lanzhou, and Suzhou, totaling five stations, each taking eighteen days, and it takes ninety days to arrive. This route has a denser population and is more convenient for travelers; and another route from Yangguan Avenue to Has, which takes one hundred and twenty days, which is the slowest.</p>

<h3 id="e134">The British Merchant's Public Bus Labor Strike Still Has No Solution <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>The Company Sends Police to Protect the Buses</p>
<p>And Refuses Unconditional Resumption of Work</p>
<p>After the British merchant's public bus workers went on strike again, the situation is quite serious. The public buses that are barely running are protected by armed Chinese police escorts. Yesterday, some workers were willing to resume work unconditionally, but were also refused. The various situations are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲Protecting the Buses</p>
<p>After the company announced the dismissal of all striking workers, the situation was quite serious. In order to prevent accidents, the company shortened the routes of Routes 1 and 9, which are barely running, moved the time of entering the factory earlier, and requested the police station to send armed Chinese police escorts. Yesterday, there were 12 buses running on Route 1, with the fare remaining the same; 8 buses on Route 2, with a uniform fare of 16 cents; 8 buses on Route 5, with a uniform fare of 11 cents; and 18 buses on Route 9, with a uniform fare of 20 cents. Each bus was protected by one armed Chinese policeman sent by the police station.</p>
<p>▲Refusing to Resume Work</p>
<p>After the British merchant's public bus strike committee put forward 11 conditions, which were rejected by the company, they declared that they would continue the strike and fight to the end, and would not resume work until their goals were achieved. Some workers, who were forced by livelihood, sent nine representatives to the main factory on Connaught Road yesterday morning to negotiate and were willing to resume work unconditionally. However, the chief manager, Gunther, refused to meet them, indicating his refusal. All the Chinese people in the company were filled with hatred for the unreasonable oppression of the foreigners.</p>
<p>▲Company's Plan</p>
<p>Since the public bus workers announced the strike on August 20, the company has lost more than 1,000 yuan every day. Of the 40 new workers recruited previously, only one-third passed the repeated training. Most of the newly recruited workers failed. The company plans to stop recruiting new workers and maintain the public buses on Routes 1, 2, 5, and 9 in a calm manner. It completely rejects any demands from the striking workers. Therefore, it is not easy for the public buses in the concession to fully recover for a while, and the labor strike is bound to be prolonged.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Real Estate Association previously recommended Dr. Xiao Qingyun as a representative to attend the committee organized by the Municipal Council to investigate the Shanghai Waterworks Company. After sending a letter to the council, the association received a reply from the Municipal Council yesterday, which said: "In response to your letter of September 7, we have received your association's appointment of Mr. Xiao Qingyun as a representative to assist Mr. Hill in reviewing the management status of the Shanghai Waterworks Company."</p>
<h3 id="e136">A Bumper Harvest of Autumn Cocoons is Expected <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>The Phenomenon of Lowering Prices to Collect Cocoons</p>
<p>The Pessimistic Future of the Silk Industry</p>
<p>In recent years, the silk and cocoon industry has been extremely depressed. Last year, due to the high price of cocoons and the low price of silk, silk factories suffered heavy losses and could not sustain themselves. They immediately appealed to the government to issue silk industry bonds to maintain them. However, the number of silk factories operating in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces this year is less than half of the total. This spring, silkworm eggs suffered severe damage from the weather, and cocoon production was extremely low. Silk mills hope that the autumn cocoons will make up for it. Fortunately, since the beginning of autumn, the temperature has been moderate, and those raising autumn silkworms in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang cocoon areas are very enthusiastic. Recently, they are about to mount the frames, and a bumper harvest is expected, especially in Wuxi and Wujin. Yesterday, we received reliable news from Wuxi that a small number of cocoons can be harvested in the northeast countryside, and the quality of the cocoons is still good. Silk and cocoon merchants are panicking and lowering prices to compete for collection. The price of fresh cocoons has been lowered to more than 70 yuan per picul. The cost of raw silk is more than 1,000 taels of silver per bale of 100 catties. According to the current price of silk, each bale will lose 100 to 200 taels of silver, which is really their own fault. Moreover, most are currently mounting the frames, so it is inevitable to avoid the disadvantages of picking tender cocoons (i.e., falling off the mountain early without waiting for the cocoons to mature). Therefore, the future of the silk mill industry is even more pessimistic.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Silk Industry Bonds Will Be Issued Soon <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>More Than 50 Silk Factories Have Resumed Operation</p>
<p>More Than 10,000 Workers are Saved From Unemployment Due to the Bonds</p>
<p>The 4 million yuan of the Jiang-Zhe Silk Industry Bonds, which are aimed at addressing the urgent issues, have been issued by the Fund Management Committee entrusted to the Guohuo Bank Trust Department since August 31. Silk manufacturers have been going to collect the bonds in succession in accordance with the procedures. As of yesterday, 95% have been collected. For example, 108 single-reeling factories and 7 double-reeling factories in Shanghai have all collected the bonds, except for the 7 double-reeling factories that have not collected them due to the customs collection of the fund. In Wuxi, 48 single-reeling factories have all collected the bonds, except for one that has not collected them. In Zhejiang, 25 single-reeling factories have only 4 that have not collected them. They can be fully issued within a few days. The silk factories that have received the bonds are all preparing to resume operation. For example, in this city, the number has increased from 36 to 52. More than 10,000 workers have jobs due to the bonds. The foreign bank silk market has turned around slightly. For example, the price of the 20-22 denier silk exported to the United States is 950 taels per picul for the first grade and 920 taels for the second grade. Therefore, it is expected that the number of silk factories resuming operation in this city can still increase within a few days.</p>

<p>Formulates Factory Inspection Plan</p>
<p>Divided into Five Steps</p>
<p>The Factory Inspection Law will be implemented on October 1. Whether the implementation is appropriate is of great importance to the future of our country's industry and the welfare of workers. Therefore, the Bureau of Social Affairs of this city has selected qualified personnel and sent them to the Factory Inspection Personnel Training Institute of the Ministry of Industry for training. The inspectors graduated on September 3 and have returned to the bureau for work on the 4th. The work plan has been formulated by the director of the inspection section of the bureau, Tian Heqing, and is divided into five steps: The first step is registration, which is to extract one by one the factories in this city that comply with the Factory Law, and then send a letter to the factory, setting a time limit for complying with the registration and reporting procedures. The second step is investigation, which is to have the inspectors formulate detailed forms and go to each factory to investigate the factory's equipment and the safety equipment for key personnel, mechanical safety equipment, and sanitation equipment in detail for reference. The third step is to formulate the minimum standard regulations for various equipment so that each factory has something to follow. The fourth step is to be responsible for persuasion and assistance, and the factories may also be assisted when necessary. The fifth step is to wait for the equipment of each factory to reach a considerable level before conducting inspections in accordance with the law. The bureau is currently carrying out preliminary work. On the 7th, it sent people to consult the forms investigated by the Industrial Joint Investigation Office of this city to make a preliminary design, extract the factories in this city that comply with the Factory Law, and then proceed with registration, investigation, and other work. In addition to the inspectors carrying out daily work, the bureau also organizes a Factory Equipment Review Committee to review all difficult issues. The committee held its first meeting yesterday to discuss the difficult issues in the Factory Law. The results have not been announced because the time is not right.</p>

On the 11th, he will visit the British American Tobacco Factory on Tao Peng Road and the Tianyi Flavor Factory. The visiting affairs have been handled by the director of the inspection section of the Bureau of Social Affairs, Tian Heqing, who is responsible for receiving and entertaining everything, and the factory inspectors of the bureau take turns accompanying the visit. According to Boon's conversation, he is very willing to visit smaller factories this time in order to plan the preparation materials for inspection, because the difficulties encountered during inspection are most common in smaller factories, so he should try to avoid them in advance. It is also heard that he will host a banquet for the representatives of the city's trade unions, Hou Dachun, Li Yongxiang, Lu Jingshi, and Chen Peide, at the Hong Kong Road Bank Club at 5 p.m. tomorrow.</p>

<p>For July and August</p>
<p>The funds for the district party headquarters in this city are allocated by the municipal government, while the funds for the municipal party headquarters are allocated directly by the Central Government. The municipal government previously received an order from the Central Government that the funds for the municipal party headquarters would also be allocated by the municipal government from the 20th year of the Republic, with an amount of 16,000 yuan per month. However, the order did not specify whether the subsidy for the district party headquarters was included in this amount. Later, the municipal government submitted a request to the Central Government for instructions. The municipal government has now received a clear instruction from the Central Government that the funds for the district party headquarters are outside this amount, and the amount remains the same as before, 5,830 yuan per month. After receiving the order, the municipal government ordered the bureau to allocate the funds accordingly. It is heard that the funds for July and August of this year, totaling 11,660 yuan, were fully issued on September 7.</p>

<h3 id="e142">Shanghai County Restores the Bounding System <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Undertaking the Collection of Xin Cao Grain Tax</p>
<p>To Be Implemented Before October 15</p>
<p>In Shanghai County, households that have not completed the payment of the busy season grain tax outside the quota have been responsible for urging payment by the bounding industry in the past. The annual payment has long been effective. Since the change to township chiefs last year, the collection of taxes has been sluggish. It is difficult for township chiefs to take care of the local autonomy and difficult to compare with the bounding industry, which specializes in the matter. The county government has recently reported from the first district office requesting the restoration of the bundling industry system. When the Finance Bureau was ordered to formulate implementation measures, the bureau director Wang found that neighboring Songjiang, Qingpu, Nanhui and other counties had not eliminated the previous system. The upper town is the same, and the bundling industry system can be restored. When the measures were drafted, the county government ordered the approval, and the bureau and the district chiefs carefully handled it. Director Wang convened district chiefs to the bureau the day before to discuss and resolved to restore the bundling industry from the 20th year of the Republic. On the one hand, the districts informed the township heads to convene the original bounding industries and ordered them to resume the undertaking of the busy season affairs, and all of them were implemented before October 15. In addition to recording and reporting the resolutions to the county government, the bureau also informed the people of the county to know.</p>

<p>Notice from the Collection Branch</p>
<p>The Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Collection Branch of Shanghai County sent a notice to various pharmacies and hotels yesterday, saying: "For notification, the Jiangsu Shangbao Chuanchongqi Tobacco and Alcohol License Tax Collection Bureau ordered that the tobacco and alcohol license tax has always been the nature of a contractor. The change to the commissioned office this time is to eliminate accumulated malpractices and rectify tax revenue. It is now found that pharmacies that operate medicinal alcohol and restaurants and hotels that also operate tobacco and alcohol should pay taxes separately in accordance with the regulations. In addition to the separate orders, the director should immediately follow the instructions, immediately investigate and verify the above-mentioned merchants, break away from personal feelings, and earnestly rectify them. Starting from this autumn, order them to pay taxes and obtain licenses in order to comply with the regulations and maintain the national tax, and do not slightly conceal any faults. The group collection staff of our office have been ordered to collect and order the payment of taxes and obtain licenses. According to Article 4 of the detailed rules promulgated by the ministry, if the merchants who have obtained licenses have not applied for a new license after the deadline in the previous article, the competent tax collection agency shall warn them in writing. If they still do not apply for a new license within ten days from the date of delivery of the warning letter, in addition to ordering them to pay taxes and exchange licenses, they shall be fined from one-tenth to two-tenths of the tax payable per quarter. If they still delay in applying for a new license one month after the date of delivery of the warning letter, they shall be deemed to be operating without a license and shall be handled in accordance with Article 8 of the Provisional Regulations on Tobacco and Alcohol Business Licenses: (1) For the first offense, a fine of one to two times the tax payable per quarter shall be imposed; (2) For the second offense, a fine of three to ten times the tax payable per quarter shall be imposed; (3) For the third offense, they shall not be allowed to operate. The store has been urged to pay taxes and obtain a license before the deadline, which has been exceeded. It is hereby notified that the store should follow the instructions and pay taxes and obtain a license at the office on the day, and do not play around or violate them, so as not to interfere with the penalty. This is the most important thing."</p>

<p>Mr. Wu Tingsheng, Chairman of the Shanghai Cigarette Factory Association, has spared no effort in organizing the association's affairs since taking office. Recently, he felt that the environment was difficult and it was difficult to handle affairs, and the smuggling of cigarettes was rampant and could not be stopped. He specially wrote to resign, saying: "Dear Sir, the association has been established for more than a year. I have been honored by the members who have been mistakenly selected to be the chairman. Since taking office, I have always been vigilant. Fortunately, with the cooperation of all the members, I have been able to work together for the public good and charity. Every time the tax is increased, I have advised the members to bear the burden. I am impressed by the enthusiasm for the association's affairs. However, the higher the tax rate, the more smuggling there is. The smuggling of cigarettes is rampant and cannot be stopped. Repeated appeals have been ineffective. The legitimate business is affected day by day, and I am deeply saddened. Instead of occupying a position without doing anything, it is better to avoid it and give way to the more capable. Therefore, I hereby resign from the post. I hope you will consider it." It is heard that the members of the association will convene an emergency meeting after hearing the news.</p>

<p>Local News: Two Missing Cars Found, Suspected to Be Related to Kidnapping Case. The Yong'an Automobile Company on North Sichuan Road had two men and women rent a car at about 7:50 p.m. the night before. The accountant instructed the driver Gao Zhengsheng to drive the Shanghai Municipal car number 4573 (Concession 18100). The renters first ordered the driver to drive to the 16th Bund, and then to the side of the cemetery on Avenue Albert in the French Concession. They pushed the driver to the ground, and then the bandits drove the car elsewhere. This car was only found around 1 p.m. yesterday in the middle section of Hardoon Road. It is said that this car may be related to the kidnapping case that occurred in the French Concession the day before. Housheng Yarn Factory Workers Sue Representatives for Embezzling Huge Sum of Dismissal Compensation of 210,000 Yuan, Accusing Representatives of Embezzling All. The Housheng Ziji Yarn Factory on Yangshupu Lan Road has been established for many years, with thousands of male and female workers. Unexpectedly, on December 21st of last year, the yarn factory suddenly announced its closure. When the news came, all the workers were shocked and distressed, and because it was the end of the year, it was difficult to find work, and they did not know how to make a living. Therefore, nine foremen, Cai Huansheng, Yan Baobao, Yang Fobao, Yu Asi, Jiang Erlang, Jiang Yaozhen, Wang Guansong, Chen Songyun, Yuan Xie Kang, etc., volunteered to be representatives to negotiate with the management, requesting five months' wages and three months' retirement pay. Later, because the investor, Bei Runsheng, and the manager, Li Dixian, did not agree, Cai Huansheng and others hired lawyer Jiang Yiping to file a complaint with the former French Concession Public Concession. As a result, a settlement was reached, and the case was withdrawn. However, the workers learned that the investor had paid 210,000 yuan as dismissal compensation for the workers, which was given to the workers' representatives. However, the workers have not received a single penny to this day, and it is obvious that the representatives have embezzled it. Therefore, three workers, Shen Dalang, Huang Jinbao, and Zhu Haibao, hired lawyers Wang Zuxun and Xue Jiaqi to file a complaint against the nine representatives, Cai Huansheng, et al., with the First Special District Local Court, accusing them of breach of trust and embezzlement, and requesting that witnesses Li Dixing, Yuan Runsheng, Jiang Yiping, and Xue Gansheng be summoned to court for questioning. At 2:30 p.m. yesterday, Judge Wu Tingqi presided over a hearing in the Second Criminal Court. None of the defendants appeared in court, only the plaintiffs Shen and Huang, accompanied by their attorneys, were present. The plaintiffs' attorney began by stating the circumstances of the case. Then, Judge Wu asked the two plaintiffs what they were accusing the defendants of. According to Huang Jinbao, they were accusing Cai Huansheng and others of embezzling the dismissal compensation. He asked, "How much in total?" He replied, "210,000 yuan." He asked, "How much should each person receive?" He replied, "210,000 yuan." He asked, "Each person..." The case had already been filed with the former French Concession Public Concession, and it was strange to abandon the original trial court and pursue the matter in this court. Moreover, this case is of a civil nature and does not involve criminal matters. A lawsuit should first be filed with the Civil Court. Therefore, he ordered that whether a crime was committed in this case should first be resolved through a civil lawsuit, and then this case would be processed. Zhang Shiming's Concubine and Son's Lawsuit Dismissed. Zhou Miaoying, the concubine of the wealthy Zhang Shiming of Nanxun, filed a lawsuit against Zhang Shiming's (deceased) principal wife, Xu, and Zhang Qu, because her son, Zhang Qu, was engaged and married without notifying or seeking her consent. She requested that the relationship between mother and son be confirmed in the Special District Court. Zhang Xu and others hired lawyers Zhu Sifu and Jiang Yiping to defend them, arguing that Zhou Miaoying had previously received 40,000 yuan and had signed a document severing her family relationship, so she could no longer come forward and make claims. Subsequently, Zhou Miaoying lost the case. Zhou refused to accept the judgment and hired lawyers Ai Yang'an and Wu Jingxiong to appeal to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. Zhang Xu and Zhang Qu were still represented by lawyers Zhu and Jiang. The details of the repeated summons have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon was the date for the pronouncement of the judgment. Lawyer Zhu Sifu was also present in court to await instructions. At 2 p.m., the Civil Court President Hu Yigu, accompanied by Judges Han and Ye, took their seats in the Second Civil Court and announced that the appeal was dismissed and that the appellant would bear the costs of the second instance. The Xue Family Property Lawsuit Continued to Investigate the Exact Amount of Property. After the death of Xue Baorun, a major pigment merchant, his family became embroiled in a lawsuit over the division of his estate. Xue had four sons and three daughters, all of whom were already married. Ming Qin Fang, who was married to Hua Lihou, passed away in the eighth year of the Republic. Qin Fang had two sons and one daughter, named Yi Hong, Yi Gu, and Man Yun. Now, Yi Gu and Man Yun, as siblings, through their father Hua Lihou in legal guardian qualifications, hired lawyers Yang Linzhi and Ye Shaoying in the First Special District Local Court, accusing Xue Baorun's wife Sun and Xue's four sons Gansheng, Yansheng, Jiasheng, and Gengsheng, requesting to be given the share of Xue Baorun's estate that their deceased mother Xue Qin Fang should have received. Yesterday morning, Judge Li Mo opened the court to summon the parties. According to the plaintiff's legal guardian Hua Lihou, my wife passed away in the eighth year of the Republic. She had two sons and one daughter. Now that my wife's father has passed away, the estate should be divided equally among the seven children. However, Xue Baobao has already received a share. According to the investigation, the estate is worth 3 million yuan, so excluding Baobao, it should be divided into six shares. My wife should receive 500,000 yuan. Although my wife has also passed away, she has children, and these rights should be inherited by her children. Since they are all minors, I am legally entitled to claim on their behalf, etc. He also submitted a list of Xue's estate items for review. The defendant's attorneys Lin Yingqing and Wang Zijian opposed the plaintiff's claim, saying that although the current law grants women the right to inherit property, it is subject to the statute of limitations. The plaintiff's mother passed away in the eighth year of the Republic. At that time, the law on women's inheritance of property had not yet come into effect. How can they invoke it to make a claim? Moreover, Xue Qin Fang had two sons and one daughter, but now there are only one son and one daughter as plaintiffs, which is incomprehensible, etc. At the end, the attorney disputed the list of assets submitted by the plaintiff. Judge Li ordered that the investigation into the property be clarified, and then the hearing would continue. The Court Has Investigated the Facts in the Case of Killing One's Husband. The case of Yang Linxiang, a villager from A Yi Bridge Village, Ximeilong, Caohejing, who was allegedly murdered by his wife, etc., has been reported in previous issues. It is now known that the local court has not been able to bring the wife of the deceased to court, and all the related parties have fled. Although it has not been clearly verified that he was suffocated with a basket, judging from the above circumstances, the explanation of suicide due to trivial quarrels is difficult to believe. Therefore, the police have been ordered to investigate the facts and detain the relevant parties for investigation and prosecution. A Female Corpse Was Found at the Entrance of Dabu Street, Said to Have Died of Illness. Yesterday morning, a young female corpse, about 20 years old, was suddenly found at the entrance of Dabu Street in Xinbeimen. Her hair was cut short. She was wearing a gray single silk shirt and white calico pants, but they were very dirty. Judging from her appearance, although she was still quite beautiful, her emaciated cheeks were sunken and her lips were split, revealing two gold teeth. She seemed to be a runaway servant. The Section Chief of the First District ordered the local constable Huang Baoyuan to report to the court. At 4 p.m. that day, Prosecutor Yang Wenjun arrived at the scene for an inspection. It was determined that she died of illness. The official ordered Fuyuantang to prepare a coffin for burial. The Apprentice at the Pharmacy Killed the Shop Owner in the Middle of the Night Because the Loan Was Not Granted and He Was Drunk. Ma Youzhi's Injuries Were Still Minor. The Murderer Claimed It Was Due to Jealousy. Xu Guozhang from Changzhou was an apprentice at the Jiuhetang Pharmacy at No. 1039 Dongyouheng Road, owned by Ma Youzhi from Zhenjiang. He had previously borrowed 50 yuan from Ma, but Ma only agreed to give him five silver dollars. Xu was dissatisfied, thinking that the owner had earned hundreds of yuan recently, so why be stingy with such a small amount? He harbored evil intentions and thought of harming him. The night before, he secretly went out and bought a large bottle of sorghum wine and brought it back, drinking to intoxication with his colleague surnamed Xu. They each returned to their bedrooms. Unexpectedly, Xu became extremely drunk and rushed into Ma Youzhi's bedroom with a kitchen knife. It was already close to midnight, and Ma was sleeping soundly in bed, having a good dream. Xu raised the kitchen knife and slashed at Ma's head, chest, and waist. Ma woke up in extreme pain and screamed for help. The apprentices heard the alarm and opened the shop door, flying to report to the nearby Chinese constable at No. 1168. They captured Xu, seized the kitchen knife, and took him to the Huishan Police Station, reporting to the head constable, who ordered him to be detained. The injured person was taken to Tongren Hospital for treatment. Fortunately, the injuries were minor and he was expected to recover. Yesterday morning, the police station escorted Xu Guozhang to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court. According to the police station's attorney Zhang Tianyin, the defendant intended to plot to murder and seize property. The victim, Ma Youzhi, arrived in court with his injuries to testify about the situation at the time, claiming that he had 500-600 yuan in silver, which the defendant had seen, which led to this incident, etc. When questioned, the defendant confessed that he was in a good mood last night and drank half a catty of sorghum wine with his colleague Mr. Xu, which led to the trouble due to drunkenness. The purpose was actually a female tenant, because the owner and I both wanted to have relations with her, and I had previously been scolded by him, harboring resentment in my heart, so I committed this act in a drunken stupor, please have mercy. Judge Xiao Xie Fen verified the confession and ordered the defendant to be detained for further interrogation after witnesses were summoned. A Cantonese Man, Ge Shaoxian, Was So Frustrated by His Incurable Illness That He Took Poison. Ge Shaoxian, 29 years old, resided at No. 31 Dekang Lane, Fusheng Road, Zhabei, and was employed at the Power Company. His father, Ge Jiesan, was a runner at the Meifu Company. Because of discord between father and son, he lived separately from his concubine. Shaoxian was physically weak and contracted tuberculosis. Although he was surrounded by medicine all day long, medicine was ineffective. In anger and frustration, he conceived the idea of death and swallowed iodine to commit suicide. His neighbors noticed and sent him to Tongren Hospital for treatment. It is said that he took too much poison and his life may be in danger. Three Water Patrol Officers Beat a Boatman and Drowned Him. Pan Rong Sheng, Gao Shu Sheng, Xia Yong Kuan and other patrolmen of the First Squadron of the Water Police Force were patrolling in Puzhong Tangkou when they beat a boatman into the river and drowned him during an inspection. After the incident, the victim's family reported the incident to the Local Court, which sent a letter to the district department for investigation. The district department detained and interrogated Pan and others. Although their confession did not admit the incident, the victim's family had specifically identified them. Yesterday the patrol officer transferred the three patrolmen to the Local Court for interrogation. A Forced Marriage Dispute: An Adopted Daughter Cannot Marry Her Brother. Jiang Yinxing, a 44-year-old man from Fenghua, went to Yan Jiangshi's residence at No. 18 Renyuli, Zhongxing Road, Zhabei, yesterday at around 4:00 p.m. to forcibly take the 17-year-old Liu Aying back home to marry his brother Jiang Zhijin. Yan refused at the time, and when the police arrived, Jiang Yinxing was taken to the Fifth District Public Security Bureau for investigation. According to Jiang Yinxing, Liu Aying was originally an abandoned girl who was adopted from the Fenghua Infant Nursery when she was two years old, intending to be his brother Zhijin's wife. When Aying was four years old, Jiang took Aying to Shanghai and handed her over to his sister Yan Jiangshi to raise. Now that Aying is of age, he wanted to take her back to his hometown for marriage, but Jiang refused. Yan Jiangshi claimed that she had long recognized Liu Aying as her adopted daughter and had a mother-daughter relationship, so it was unreasonable for her to marry Zhijin, which is why she refused. Director You of the district, seeing that the two parties held different opinions, decided to hand the matter over to the Judicial Section for review. Lin Fubao Was Arrested for Stabbing His Enemy. Zhang Shanbiao and Zhuang Daxiang from Yongren had a long-standing feud with Lin Fubao from the same village. Yesterday morning, Lin stabbed them in the legs, etc., on Tangshan Road.

Reader's Letter: A Miss Writes: I am a young woman, and my level of education is in the second year of junior high school. I used to study at a church school and have now transferred to a midwifery school. Because I was adopted by my parents when I was young, and my parents have now given birth to a younger sister, my parents did not allow me to enter the midwifery school before I entered it. However, I resolutely wanted to enter, and it has been a year now. Unfortunately, my father's business has stopped, and our financial situation is becoming increasingly difficult. It takes two years to graduate from midwifery school, plus a half-year internship. The cost is very high, so my parents do not allow me to continue in this school. However, although I am a woman, I also have the ambition to be self-reliant. If I drop out of school, wouldn't that be a pity? I remember the saying, "If you don't work hard when you are young, you will only regret it when you are old," and I can't help but sigh. I also think of the meaning of not giving up after a hundred setbacks, and I still want to enter this school. However, how can I bear the scolding and reproaches I receive every day? I hope that you, sir, can find me a suitable job or allow me to continue studying at the midwifery school. I humbly ask you to show me a good way and answer me in the newspaper. (Reply) We are very sympathetic to your situation, admire your ambition, and are very willing to help you solve your problems. However, this newspaper does not have a job placement agency, and we do not know what places need people, so we cannot help you find a job. You should ask others for an introduction. However, it is very difficult to find a job without a specialty. It is best to finish your studies at the midwifery school. Since your father is unable to continue providing you with tuition, can you find a way to borrow money from relatives and friends? Fortunately, you only have one year left to study. Or, borrow money to study for half a year first, and with your utmost efforts, get good grades. In the remaining half year, based on your qualifications as an excellent student, declare to the school that you are willing to be a hard-working student who provides services, and request free or reduced fees. Once you graduate, you can perform midwifery duties and use your income to repay your debts and show filial piety to your parents. Not only will you overcome the difficulties, but your family will be harmonious and your future will be infinitely bright. Everything in the world depends on human effort. Do not be discouraged. You must rely on your sincerity, muster your courage, and work hard in every possible way. Stamp for Communication. Weather Report: The meteorological forecast from the Xujiahui Observatory at 4:30 p.m. yesterday stated that the weather on the coast here is sunny, with gentle winds from the southeast. The weather on the Shandong coast is cloudy, with winds in no fixed direction. There are northeast winds in the East China Sea. The weather southeast of Miyako Island is bad, due to a hurricane that is currently spinning and not moving forward. Also, in the 24 hours before 3 p.m. yesterday, the highest temperature in Shanghai was 87.9 degrees and the lowest was 69.5 degrees. On the same day last year, the highest was 94.3 degrees and the lowest was 73.8 degrees. Letter to the Editor: Respected Sir, In your newspaper's "Local News" column on September 9th, there was a report about "Swindling 100,000 Yuan in Public Bonds," which involved our company. After investigation, it was found that the Wen Zhou Fu Zi Zhuang store clerks were involved in fraud, which has nothing to do with our company. After purchasing the bonds, the store temporarily deposited them with our company. On the morning of August 31st, our company received a registered letter from the store stating that they had sent a clerk, Zhu Ming, to Shanghai to claim the bonds based on the letter. Shortly after, Zhu Ming came to claim the bonds with the store's letter of credit. Our company checked the seals on both letters and found that they matched the historical seals, so they were returned. It was not until midnight that day that our company received a telegram from the store stating that the seal had been stolen by the store clerks. Therefore, this matter was caused by internal fraud within the store and was not due to our company being deceived. Subsequently, the manager of the store came to Shanghai to report the case to the police for investigation. All the investigation and detention matters were handled by the store itself and had nothing to do with our company. Please correct this to clarify the facts and avoid misunderstandings. Sincerely, Shanghai Tongyi Trust Company, September 9th.</p>

<p>Free Talk No Removing Garden Grass Zhaifu Talks About What I See People who go to Japan always want to know some stories about the Emperor. I also have this curiosity. One of my questions is what is the attitude of modern Japanese towards the Emperor? How is it different from before? While in Tokyo, I saw a book in the Ohashi Library called "The Emperor and the Proletariat," which I found very strange. After reading the contents of the book carefully, I learned that the author's purpose was to combine the Emperor with the working masses to overthrow the bourgeoisie in the middle. This is a whimsical strategy. According to Miyazaki Ryusuke, there are many people in this faction. The proletarian party said that the workers would never be fooled by this theory. In short, this faction is trying to win over the workers from the Emperor's position. I found a marginal note written in blue ink in this book: (With an annual income of 20 million, watching 1.5 million unemployed people freeze and starve with nowhere to turn, still having chrysanthemum banquets today and cherry blossom viewing tomorrow, how can such people be connected with the working masses!) It is not known whose handwriting this marginal note is. Presumably it was written by a student. On January 16th of this year, I went to Momoyama to visit the Meiji Mausoleum. While I was on the mountain, there were also fifteen Japanese people who came to visit the mausoleum one after another, including farmers, old women from the countryside, children, retired soldiers from the countryside, and a worker. I stood there and carefully observed their behavior. Everyone respectfully knelt in front of the mausoleum to pray when they arrived. The children followed their parents and did the same. Only the worker stood there without bowing, looked for a moment, and then went down the mountain alone. Four Doctors Struggling in Russia Madam Yehua Who are the Four Doctors? They are Doctor of Medicine Fei Kunnian, Doctor of Law Yang Qi, Doctor of Letters Sun Pengxian, and Doctor of Engineering Xu Haiyu. The gentlemen set off from Germany and France this spring, returning to China via Siberia. They suffered hardships along the way in Soviet Russia. They extracted what Mr. Fei said to inform the countrymen to know about the experiences in Russia. ▲Traveling with the Elder Brother is Not Possible The third night of the train journey, they arrived in Moscow and rested for three and a half hours. They went to Chita. Tickets were checked along the way. The final destination on the Four Doctors' passports was Vladivostok, but the train tickets were for Manzhouli. The ticket inspector believed that the passports and train tickets did not match and was furious. He stopped their return journey. The four of them had not thought about this beforehand, and they were all saddened by this. They asked about the solution. Some said to telegraph to Moscow, and some said to turn back. They were at a loss for what to do. They met an old Polish man who planned to go to Harbin for business. He interceded with the ticket inspector, and they got off the train in Chita at midnight. They consulted with the stationmaster, but he was not there. They wandered in a foreign land in the icy and snowy ground. ▲The Doctor Suddenly Disappears That night, they met a detective. The detective was kind and volunteered to handle the passport negotiations. At 9 a.m., the detective left his post and arranged to go to the passport office together in the afternoon. While they were discussing, Dr. Xu suddenly disappeared. They searched everywhere but could not find him. Everyone suspected that something unexpected had happened. After half an hour, Xu happily arrived, saying that he had met a fellow villager from Shanxi who could help with the passport. The three were overjoyed and went to see him together. Unexpectedly, the fellow villager was a bill collector at a hotel. His residence was as dirty as a stove. The place was small and crowded. They looked at each other in dismay. However, there was nowhere else to stay, so they had to endure it. The food was worse than that of rickshaw pullers in Shanghai. Pickled vegetable and shredded pork soup were considered delicacies. The tableware was dirty and broken, and there was no way to use it. However, they were hungry and thirsty, so they had to force themselves to eat. ▲One Day After Another After the meal, the fellow villager pretended to be deaf and mute and did not mention the passport. The crowd was very anxious and urged him again and again. Finally, he drove them out. When they arrived at the passport office, it was already full of people. They waited for a long time, and the person in charge arrived late. After questioning, they paid 35 gold each and were allowed to pick up their passports at 4 p.m. After the passports were issued, the second step was to buy sleeper tickets for the train. The Chita express train ran once a day, and the slow train ran every other day. They had already missed it that day, so they stayed at the fellow villager's house again. They stayed here for two days. Their hearts were like arrows. At night, the four of them slept in one berth, which was extremely crowded. In the morning, the weather was cold and there was warm water. There was one small washbasin with half a basin of water. The four of them washed their faces and rinsed their mouths in it. The water was as muddy as mud. The hardships of life could not be greater than this. ▲Die as a Communist Ghost There were many overseas Chinese coming and going from the Shanxi villager's residence. They were all in the same predicament. According to them, when the Sino-Soviet conflict broke out over the Middle East Railway the year before last, many Chinese in Russia were arrested by the Latvians and forced to work as laborers. They worked more than ten hours a day, exposed to wind and rain. They were miserable beyond words. They had one meal a day and were hungry all day long. They were often tortured. Those who were seriously injured died. Such cases were not uncommon. They were displaced and worse off than chickens and dogs</p>

<p>Book and Newspaper Introductions: Shanghai People's Food Problem</p>
<p>by Man Yin</p>
<p>Published by the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs</p>
<p>(The people are the foundation of the state, and food is the people's heaven.) Although these are old sayings, I think everyone agrees with them. If we look at the history of ancient and modern times, both at home and abroad, we will know that the rise and fall of a country is largely based on whether the people's food is abundant. If the people's food is abundant, the people will live and work in peace and contentment, and society will be stable. There is no country that will not prosper. Otherwise, various disasters, such as bandits and mobs, will arise as a result, social order will be disrupted, and there is no country that will not decline. The most obvious and easily understood example is the recent revolutionary movements that have swept across countries around the world. If we analyze their causes, they are nothing more than the failure to solve the (food) problem of the majority of the people.</p>
<p>Therefore, when we study modern social problems and seek to improve society and alleviate various economic crises, there is no doubt that the people's food problem is a major issue worthy of our careful exploration. We can say that in social problems, whether it is labor problems, population problems, land problems, or even women's problems, all contain the meaning of (food), either because of (food) shortage or (food) inequality. As the saying goes, (Teach people after they are rich.) Guanzi said, (People know honor and disgrace when they have enough food and clothing.) (Sufficient food) is a prerequisite for making the people peaceful, law-abiding, and content... If we encounter years of famine and do not first seek to solve the problem of people's food, but only use morality and law to confine the people's hearts and prevent them from being chaotic, we are putting the cart before the horse, and the result will be like climbing a tree to catch fish, a futile effort.</p>
<p>But let us look at the so-called experts who study social problems today. I don’t know about other countries, but only China is disappointing. It is true that they are writing brilliant theories and shouting nice-sounding slogans. Today, they publish a great work discussing labor-capital disputes, and tomorrow, they give a speech advocating some kind of reformism. However, they have not taken into account the fundamental problem of people's food in social problems. Can this not be said to be an erroneous and contradictory phenomenon?</p>
<p>Since the rise of the revolutionary army, Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People, with the Principle of People's Livelihood as the main goal of the revolution, the urgent need to solve the problem of people's livelihood has begun to be noticed by the rulers and the majority of the people, reversing the previous mistakes. This is truly gratifying to us. Furthermore, we are particularly pleased that the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs has recently published such a book, rich in material, insightful, combining theory and practice, and promoting both slogans and work, titled (Shanghai People's Food Problem).</p>
<p>The entire book is more than 300 pages, about three hundred thousand words, truly a magnificent sight. For the convenience of introduction, it can be divided into three volumes. The first volume, Essays, is written by various members of the Food Committee of the Bureau of Social Affairs and experts in the study of food and people's food problems at home and abroad. It includes Pan Gongzhan's "Methods for Rectifying People's Food," Huang Kutong's "China's Food Problem," Wu Juenong's "Food Imports and Tax Exemption Problems," "World Rice Production and Supply and Demand," Feng Liutang's "A Study of the Origins of Chinese Grains," Gu Fu's "Private Discussions on Building Charitable Granaries," "Talks on Improving Farming," Zhu Yinong's "Grain Storage and Food Warehouses," Feng Liutang's "A General Overview of Foreign Rice Imports Over the Past Two Hundred Years," "Emergency Measures for Food," Zhu Zixiang's "A General Overview of the Rice Milling Industry in this City," Lu Wenshao's "A General Overview of the Rice Shop Industry in this City," and "A General Overview of the Business Operations of the Rice Shop Industry in this City in 1918," totaling fifteen articles. Now, I will select the most important ones to introduce as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e146">(1) Methods for Rectifying People's Food <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Without any explanation, we can know the purpose and content of this article from its name. In recent years, the Red Bandits have been rampant, floods and droughts have occurred simultaneously, and natural and man-made disasters have never ceased. The rectification of people's food is imminent. This article is aimed at this point. The full text is divided into five sections: (1) Introduction, an overview of the current situation of insufficient food in China, with more than 2,000 dan of foreign rice imported each year, worth more than 110 million taels of silver, the relationship between agricultural product prices and farmers' lives, a comparison of food prices in the past and present, and bad habits in transportation and sales. The description of the root causes of the current food shortage is quite clear. (2) Discussion on the Issues of Exporting Rice to Suppress Prices and Hoarding. A detailed explanation of the advantages and disadvantages of prohibiting rice exports, the loss of farmers due to the suppression of rice prices, and the method of hoarding rice to save emergency needs. (3) Fundamental Policies, such as establishing a food investigation committee to investigate production and sales, so that (there is enough to store, and enough to prepare for insufficiency), improving rice and wheat production methods to increase harvests, preventing natural disasters and insect pests, and improving agriculture, animal husbandry, and agricultural product manufacturing to increase people's food. These are indeed necessary measures. (4) Stopgap Policies, such as advocating the circulation of food in various provinces to facilitate regulation, prohibiting the planting of opium poppies to avoid consuming farmland, building agricultural product warehouses to alleviate farmers' urgent needs, guiding the increase and decrease of agricultural production, and preventing food waste are also necessary. (5) Matters that urgently need to be carried out to solve the people's food problem in this city, such as advocating the construction of rice wharves, rectifying grain storage, inspecting the quality of rice, registering rice shops, implementing the new peck system, and establishing agricultural experiment fields, etc.... These are all necessary tasks for rectifying the people's food in this city. The opinions in the full text are indeed excellent, the description is concise, and the suggestions for rectifying the people's food in China are based on reason and evidence. It is truly rare.</p>
<h3 id="e147">(2) Food Imports and Tax Exemption Problems <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>This article discusses in detail the great importance of long-term food imports to the national economy. Tax exemption on food will make it impossible for domestic agriculture to recover. If we want to alleviate food shortages and improve production, we should start with the problem of tax exemption. The analysis is thorough and clear. The article is divided into seven sections: introduction, the situation of food imports, tax exemption on spiritual and material food, import and export taxes on rice in various countries, the relationship between tax exemption on food imports and the national economy, why China adopts a tax exemption policy, and conclusion. In the second paragraph, it tells us that the value of food imported by China each year is about 200 million yuan, which is truly alarming. If we calculate a tariff of 10% of the value, we can get 20 million yuan each year. Even if we calculate 2.5% of the value, we can get 5 million yuan. If this amount is used to improve agriculture, the national harvest will inevitably be richer after a few years, but it is uniformly tax-free. How can the loss be estimated? On the other hand, all countries in the world tax food imports. Even countries that are not self-sufficient in food, such as Germany, France, and Japan, have import taxes. The only countries that truly exempt import taxes like China are a small number of countries such as Britain, India, and Annam. The former are industrial countries, and food must be supplied by other countries. The latter are rice-producing countries, and only export food, with no imports, so there is no need to set import taxes. Their situations are not the same as China's. The full text is reasonable and forceful, citing extensively to prove the necessity of collecting taxes on food imports. We have the same feeling after reading it. We hope that the authorities will revise it as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e148">(3) A General Overview of Foreign Rice Imports Over the Past Two Hundred Years <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>The author lists the trend of foreign rice imports into China, which is like climbing a mountain, rising step by step, starting from Emperor Zhenzong of the Song Dynasty to the Yuan, Ming, and Qing Dynasties, with an increase every year. To this day, the losses are in the tens of millions. (The article lists detailed tables, from the Qing Dynasty to the most recent years.) Just imagine, China, which claims to be based on agriculture and produces the most rice in the world, is short of food and relies on foreign sources. The amount is so large every year. Is this problem not worthy of discussion by experts who study social problems and seek to solve the people's livelihood? Although this article does not elaborate on methods to rectify people's food and reverse the leakage, it only (compiles a brief record based on the records in the books, providing considerable material for those who study the problem of people's food.) However, the numbers in these materials are so alarming. The voices of resisting foreign goods have been endless in recent days. If we do not find ways to increase food, which is even more important than foreign goods, and only rely on others, then the harm is a hundred times greater than that of foreign goods. How can we not be afraid?</p>
<p>In addition, the essays in the first volume, such as "China's Food Problem," "Private Discussions on Building Charitable Granaries," "Talks on Improving Rice Cultivation," and "Emergency Measures for Food," either seek to improve farming and increase harvests, or (accumulate the surplus to prepare for insufficiency). In short, they are all fundamental methods for rectifying the people's food problem. Due to space limitations, I cannot introduce them one by one. Readers should read the original book.</p>
<p>The second volume, Food Statistics, lists in detail the amount of various foods imported into Shanghai over the years, the high and low prices, how much is consumed in this city, and how much is left over, to provide resources for research. In China, where everything lacks statistics, we must say that this is a commendable task. Shanghai is the largest city in China, and the amount of food imported and exported is not only related to the people of Shanghai, but also to the people of the whole country. Those who study the food problem in China should not regret that this statistical material is limited to Shanghai alone. That is what should be done.</p>
<p>The third volume is a description of all the practical work carried out by the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs in this city regarding the problem of the people's food in this city. The first section, Food Administration of the Bureau of Social Affairs, recounts the relief and rectification measures taken by the bureau during the food panic in the autumn of 1918 and the spring of 1919, such as registering and evaluating public pecks, handling foreign rice, eliminating malpractices, dredging sources, fair distribution, helping farmers, and preparing storage. The second section, The Work of the Food Committee in the Past Two Years, describes the establishment of the committee and its work achievements, such as the establishment of warehouses, agricultural experiment fields, and rice wharves in the South City, the establishment of rice inspection stations, the prohibition of rice exports, the prevention of rice price increases, the implementation of measures to regulate the people's food, and the organization of price leveling. Other tasks include the drafting of various regulations on rice purchases and sales, and the improvement of all malpractices. The third section, Report on the Handling of Affordable Rice in This City. After 1918, rice prices in this city rose sharply. In view of this, the Food Committee convened committees from all walks of life to organize and handle affordable prices. This section describes the organization process, work overview, and all practical reports of the committee... This volume is rich in materials, concise in description, sufficient for reference for those who study theory, and can also be used as a reference for those who engage in practical work. It is truly a unique kind of writing.</p>
<p>Looking at the entire book, there are many places that deserve special introduction. The most alarming and must be mentioned is that China, which claims to be based on agriculture, relies on foreign countries for its people's food, with tens of millions of dan imported every year and losses of more than tens of millions of taels. There is no doubt that this indicates that China's agriculture is bankrupt. Advocating domestic goods and eliminating leakage is an urgent plan to save the country. Rectifying the people's food problem in domestic goods is an even more urgent plan in the urgent plans. Compatriots, let us quickly seek methods of rectification. Experts who study social problems, please spend more time studying it.</p>
<p>The end of the book includes various simple rules and regulations for establishing and improving organizations that address the people's food problem. Since the laws are good and beautiful, they can be adopted by later generations. The discussion and recording of the rectification of the people's food can be said to be meticulous. It is truly as Mr. Zhang Qun said (see the preface), (We believe that this book is not only helpful for studying the food problem in Shanghai, but also that those who care about the food problem in China should have a copy in hand.) The reporter respectfully introduces it to the readers of this publication. New Book News</p>
<h3 id="e149">▲ An indispensable perspective for those engaged in Nanyang business <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Liu Shimu, the editor of this book, has been studying Nanyang for nearly twenty years and regards it as a lifelong career. He has traveled to the inland areas of the British, Dutch, and French colonies in Nanyang three times to conduct on-the-spot investigations. He wrote the book (Japanese Overseas Aggression and Overseas Chinese), with every word a sharp whip and every stroke a deep pain. It is an unprecedented masterpiece introducing the affairs of Nanyang. The content of this book focuses entirely on factual collection, without empty and high-sounding theories. It covers everything about the Japanese policy of advancing south, the steps taken, and their sharp eyes and powerful methods, such as competition in shipping and fishing, the seizure of finance and commerce, the secret observation of the status of Chinese merchants, the operation of small retailers, the threat to the rulers, and the connection with the natives. Even the romantic stories, secret books, and anecdotes are widely collected and incorporated, forming a grand spectacle. If you can have this book in hand, you can not only use it to examine the courage of the Japanese advance south, but also to observe the safety of the status of overseas Chinese, and understand the truth of various businesses in Nanyang.

<p>Social News: The Life of a Career Woman in New York (12)</p>
<p>by Lin</p>
<p>The daily life of a woman who earns more than $75 a week, Maureen Sanderson, is as follows:</p>
<p>Maureen is wearing a brightly colored breakfast coat, which is a futuristic style, black with gold trim, and red and purple at the seams, which is very pleasing to the eye. She looked at the clock and it was exactly 9:15. Oh dear, she has an appointment at 10:00 with an administrator at a large company. Maureen works in advertising at that company. Maureen is an important designer at an advertising agency. She is in charge of two important affairs, one of which is mentioned here.</p>
<p>Her work includes advertising design and writing. In addition, she is also a consultant on the company's advertising policies and strategies. She must have the trust and respect of important employees in the company, which is absolutely essential.</p>
<p>Maureen's salary is $100 a week. She studied elsewhere for several years before joining the advertising agency to obtain this superior position. She worked in a department store for two years, specializing in writing advertisements. After that, she worked independently for a year, writing promotional brochures, advertising texts, and various other pieces, doing whatever she could find. Her life was not very stable during this year, because her income was not a fixed amount. Later, she joined this advertising agency and made great progress.</p>
<p>Although she does not have a fixed working hours to keep, she often spends a lot of time at her desk completing her work. When the work is completed, she goes out without much delay.</p>
<p>This morning, she had already thought through the words she would use when she visited. She had already come up with a competitive advertising plan and was determined to win. When she was taking a bath and getting dressed, she regarded it as the best opportunity to use her brain. She first made an outline of the important points, and then wrote a trial copy. She felt that this plan was different from others and would definitely be able to promote the goods. She still had to think carefully about the unfinished part of the plan. Someone often said to Maureen that work does not take a long time and is certainly an easy task. Maureen sometimes replied to them that she had to do many hours of work outside the office. When she was sleeping at night, maybe an idea would pop up in her mind, and she would immediately get out of bed and write down the key points. In the morning, this abstract was sometimes very useful, but sometimes it was very ridiculous.</p>
<p>At 9:30, Maureen left her residence. A few minutes later, she had breakfast at a small shop, where the eggs and milkshakes are very famous. Maureen does not have to worry about how much the things she eats cost, anyway, the things are fair. She does not have to worry about economics either. She lives in a co-op apartment and pays $85 a month for rent. She likes to live alone. She hires a woman to clean up for her, who comes for two hours every day and gets paid 50 cents an hour. Sometimes this assistant woman prepares meals for Maureen and her guests. Maureen often wants to prepare dinner herself. She is very interested in her family and often adds decorative items. She is very interested in modern sculptures, but she cannot always get what she likes.</p>
<p>Maureen can save some money from her salary. She stipulates that she saves $10 a week and uses the money to buy public utility stocks. Sometimes she accumulates cash, but after a period of time, she uses the accumulated money to buy a new chair, a new piece of clothing, or other equally valuable semi-luxury items.</p>
<p>At 10:03, Maureen walked into her office. The person she had an appointment with was already waiting for her. They discussed the advertising plan for an hour and a half. In the end, that person only agreed to half of Maureen's suggestions. He still wanted to think about the entire plan carefully. Maureen just smiled. She thought that if another man had offered this plan to her client, he would have accepted it very readily. In the modern business world, men still have some doubts about women's talents.</p>
<p>Maureen still has to wait. She knows that the things she has encountered before may be encountered again. After a while, that company will adopt the plan she suggested, but will not give her credit. She tried not to think about this in her mind and cheer herself up, thinking that these small things are not worth taking credit for. Maureen hopes that one day she will be able to save enough money to live abroad for a year. Then she will try to write. Maybe she can really write then. She feels emotional about all living things. She treats people with understanding and love. Of course, she has this quality, so that she can describe their lives. In addition, even if the hope in her works cannot be realized, she will not feel unhappy about life.</p>
<p>At 1:00 PM, Maureen had a lunch appointment with Yashu Xinposheng. Xinposheng is a young electrical engineer who is very interested in her. She also likes Yashu and has a good feeling for him. However, he lacks a kind of magic that others have, a magic of surprise and attraction. Yashu wants her to marry him. Maureen can't think of a reason why not to marry him. He is handsome, successful, and reliable. Maureen's heart is full of romance. Once she falls in love, she wants to take it all away. She wants to get married if she feels that she can get extraordinary happiness from it. She does not need children now, although she knows that she can love her own son. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e150">The City Chamber of Commerce Again Petitions for the Reduction of Shanxi Coal Freight Rates <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Over 100,000 Tons of Coal Stockpiled in Northern Shanxi</p>
<p>Urgent Hope for Prompt Enactment of Fee Reduction Measures</p>
<p>Yesterday, the City Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to the Ministry of Railways in Nanjing, requesting a reduction in freight rates to facilitate the transportation of stockpiled coal from northern Shanxi. The original telegram read: "To the esteemed Ministry of Railways: In May of this year, regarding the petition for a reduction in Shanxi coal freight rates, we received your ministry's reply, via telegram, on the 18th of the same month, stating that the current increase in freight rates across various routes was a measure taken out of necessity, and that it was difficult to make immediate changes at this time. After relaying this information to the Kouquan Station Coal Industry Joint Association, we subsequently received a letter from the same association on August 24th, stating that the association had simultaneously submitted a memorial to your ministry, which was given the reference number 業字第八八九, indicating that the railway transportation of coal was of utmost importance to the people's livelihood and national revenue, and that a comprehensive investigation of transportation conditions across various routes was currently underway, with a plan to devise appropriate measures after ascertaining the actual situation. Two months have passed, but we have not received any further instructions. Meanwhile, the Shanxi Provincial Mining Bureau and the Baojin Company have stockpiled over 100,000 tons of coal, and the mines are reducing production by only 200 tons per day in order to maintain the livelihood of the miners, a situation that is becoming increasingly precarious. We have already sent a clever telegram to your ministry, requesting that the reduction of Shanxi coal freight rates on the Ping-Sui Railway be implemented as soon as possible, and we are providing a copy of the telegram for your coordinated appeal. Furthermore, upon examining Industrial Bulletin No. 30, we found an article containing a letter from the Ministry of Industry to the China Mining Association, which quoted a reply from your ministry to the Ministry of Industry stating that the Jiaoji, Ping-Sui, and other railways had special circumstances regarding coal transportation, and that your ministry had already established separate measures to reduce freight rates in order to maintain the coal industry. Therefore, the need to reduce Shanxi coal freight rates has been repeatedly emphasized by the association and the Ministry of Industry, and your ministry is already aware of this and has agreed to make revisions. However, much time has passed, and no implementation has occurred, and the coal industry still has no hope of recovery. Based on the aforementioned situation, we respectfully submit this telegram to your ministry for your review and approval, requesting that you promptly enact measures to reduce Shanxi coal freight rates on the Ping-Sui Railway, in order to alleviate the burden on mine operators, expand the market for domestic coal, stem losses, and enrich the people's livelihood. This one action is of the utmost urgency. Yours respectfully, the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce."</p>

<p>Yesterday was the 27th day of the seventh lunar month, traditionally known as the Festival of the Three Officials. Adhering to custom, merchants and common people set up stalls to conduct business outside the Great South Gate of the South City, on Great Buddha Factory Road, Fushan Hall Street, and in the Lujiabang area. All kinds of household goods were readily available. Residents in the vicinity flocked to make purchases, creating a crowded scene akin to that on the Shanyin Road. Chief Jin of the First District, Third Precinct, dispatched many police officers to patrol the area in shifts from morning to night. This situation was, in effect, a temporary national products market.</p>
