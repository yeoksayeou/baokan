<h3>水災之善後</h3>
<p>此次水災之善後。最切要者爲救目前之急。不在乎高談整個計劃。而在乎將已出險與潰决之工程切實施治也若高談整個計劃。江淮河海。全盤統籌。勢必曠日持久。徒託空言而無實際。又不在乎徒爭負責者之如何懲罰。而在乎追求以往水利之所以廢弛。與釀成此次鉅禍之由來。合官民之力以迅速補救之也。若徒追求負責者以應得之罪。則雖殺其身食其肉。亦不足以抵償數千萬人民之損失。而反致意見横生。轉於施救之工作。增加障碍。蓋今日正在一致努力救急之時。而非唱高調與爭意氣之日也。</p>
<p>今日之運河。旣有束手無策之勢。此後如仍諉其責於一般毫無經騐之人員。則前途實多危險。故此後第一宜擇有經騐之人以擔任其事。近見報載茅以昇之語曰。「此次颶風大浪。即建築完整石工三層之海塘。尙且爲海潮打破。而况湖水浩瀚。不啻海洋。隄低土鬆。更若摧枯拉朽。」驟聆其言。似甚有理。然一究其實。則大謬不然。蓋河海水性不同。海之水性硬。故三層石塘。猶慮不足以當海潮之襲擊。運河之水性娱。故僅用泥土草料而已足。若如茅氏所言。必將以防海之法防運。築海塘之工程以築河隄而後可。豈非可笑之甚乎。水性不識。如何能當治水之責任。記者舉此一例。以證治水之必須有經騐也。其次爲治水機關之組織。前清責任專。有專欵。有專料。歲歲修理。故雖遇險而不至手足無措。近年以來。機關組織。略有變更。局面小。承轉多。辦事上之運用。遂不靈動。治水之欵。移於他用。工料更無儲蓄。歲修之事。亦遂廢而不舉。名爲水利。而實徒有空名。以如是之毫無準備。一量猝然遇大風雨之壓迫。宜乎其束手而待斃也。故今後之治水機關。應亟思所以以改善之法。又次爲工程新舊。亦不能拘泥一端。新工未必盡善。舊工亦未必盡非。似應有所參酌。即以海塘論。新工用水泥鋼骨。固較前堅固。然舊法斜坡式之石灘舖。實較新法之壁立式爲善。蓋斜坡式足以殺衝刷之水勢。壁立則水勢苟猛。必易撼動。此其理即我輩外行。亦能知之。記者舉此一端。亦以證舊法之未可盡廢耳。總之今後關於治水之問題甚多。必當擇其最急要者。開誠研究。一致努力以解决目前救急之方法。然後漸及根本上之整理。不可固執成見。亦不可敷衍推諉。而一切空言無謂之爭執悉數捐除。庶乎近之矣。</p>

<h3>九江災民啼飢號寒</h3>
<p>災民達十五萬以上</p>
<p>振災欵項寥寥無幾</p>
<p>難民收容亦未實行</p>
<p>九江通信、近百年來、九江只漲過四次大水、第一次在光緒四年、第二次在光緒二十七年、第三次在民國十五年、此三次大水之最高水位爲四十四尺九寸、潰决堤圩、皆在夏歷六月初旬、在白露節前數日、即開始退水、至中秋節後半月内、即可退盡、農民尙可補種、傷亡人口、倒塌房屋、亦極有限、惟此次水勢之大、損失之鉅、不但前所未見、亦聞所未聞、水位最高時、竟達四十五尺五、造成空前未有之新紀錄、白露已逾數日、江水仍在時漲時跌之中、從未落至四十五尺、據老農云、白露漲水、大雪難退、是今年冬作毫無希望、明年上季、莫想收成矣、淹斃人口、數逾二千、江中至今尙有浮屍發現、損失財産、價値千萬、十年之中、難望恢復元氣、往年水災、災民尙可往他處逃生、今年則各地大水、逃往安徽者、竟行數日過數縣、不得一食、前進無路、後退無門、餓死病死者過半數、亦有憤極而投水自盡投繯自縊者、至最近數日、九江當局、始有搭棚準備收容之舉、災民乃紛紛折回、然其數已不及去時一半矣、其逃往南昌者、經省振務會暫爲收容、由民政廳令飭九江縣政府、迅即派員領回、并令停止發給難民出外覓食護照、其已發出者、立即追回、命令固已下、其奈災民不甘坐以待斃、故最近一週間、逃往南昌者、據省報所載、仍逾千人、總計由縣政府給照出外覓食者、有二萬五千餘人、散居潯市者、有一萬六千餘人、此四萬餘災民、大半爲距潯較近之江北第九區封廓鄕人、其江北距湖口彭澤較近之第八區桑落鄕、江南距九江縣屬第二四五六等區較近之第七區赤松鄕兩處、所有災民、則僅恃餘糧與種子以充飢、農村秩序、紊亂已極、官廳亦無法維持、瞻顧前途、不禁懍然、此外尙有十萬以上之災民、因有餘糧及種子、故仍在堤壩之上、搭棚撑幕而居、每日或間日食粥一餐、如一個半月以後、再無接濟、食料勢亦告罄矣、</p>
<p>關於振災進行、頗嫌太不積極、如劉峙首先捐助救濟贛災之五千元現欵、省府分别支配、九江得六百元、此六百元至今日尙無下落、又有振務會决議撥發九江急振洋三千元、此三千元之通知書、至今只向南昌商會押得九百元、又由各處募捐、計得一千九百元、查自八月一日成災之日起、至今足越一個半月、只得到二千八百元之振欵、以之振濟十五萬以上之災民、實無濟於事也、</p>
<p>耕牛暫質所業已成立、其基金爲二千元、此二千元亦在二千八百元振欵内撥充、現收得耕牛二百餘頭、因辦理不善、死亡過半、國府救濟水災委員會委員周百朋來潯視察、見此情形、大不謂然、乃會同九江水災籌振會（現改名水災救濟委員會）委員蔣羣等、擇定蓮花洞·十里舖·高昌廟·茅山豈頭四處、分設牛棚、以免發生牛疫、但因連日天雨、未能着手搭棚、</p>
<p>關於施粥事項、在八月二十九日以前、毫無秩序、有一人而領得五六人之領粥證者、有五六人而不能領得一證者、籌振會發現此弊、乃召集各災民在大校塲點騐、從新按名給證、始得均平、然而粥少僧多、供不應求、弱者守候終日而不得一食者、亦頗不乏人、且因執司煑粥者、太不講求清潔、米只略洗一次、便即下鍋、鍋埋土中、泥土與蒼蠅隨煑隨落鍋中、待粥煑成、望之如菉豆稀飯、災民吃不下咽、乃要求發米自炊、籌振會因防失愼未允、至施粥之米、爲熊式輝所捐之二千五百小包、（合五百包）與潯湖米榖稽查所所查獲充公之偷運出口者八十二包、至於購來者甚少、現在原有者亦將盡矣、</p>
<p>難民收容所、現正在積極趕造中、由水災救濟委員會所辦者可容一萬人、由私人捐辦者可容一千人、大約本月二十日左右、可望開始收容、擬日給一粥一飯、壯丁以工代振、其工振計劃、第一步（一）掘平老城牆基、塡平附近溝壑、以增加官産、并爲將來延長環城馬路、修築九江湖口公路之預備工程、（二）掘取大校塲山土、塡平城内最易漫水之蓮花池、以增加官産、第二步則收拾潰口、補修堤圩、第三步則修築九江黄梅間縣道、現第一步工程、業經周百朋及濬浦局工程師金時中等、察勘一次、認爲可行、正由金時中與計劃人劉禮修、擬具預算、俟振欵發下、即行施工、</p>
<p>上海華洋義振會、日前匯到二萬元、交由周百朋辦理急振、此欵現存在中央分銀行未動、周定於十六起、親赴災情最重之江北第九·第八·兩區、及江南第七區、視察一週、然後再以印就半元一張之兌換劵、發給災民、持向附近所委託之商店兌取現金、以十五萬以上之災民、分二萬元之振欵、亦覺杯水車薪、而且連日西北風頗厲、身着夾衣、尙不覺暖、是災民由啼飢而兼號寒、亦云慘矣、（九月十六日）</p>
<h3>鎭揚交通暫時停頓</h3>
<p>揚州通信、運河水勢、昨得江都段報告、三溝閘水、已由一丈五尺、跌至一丈四尺八寸、嗣又續漲一寸、現存一丈四尺九寸、惟揚州東鈔關各城内、尙均有水漫入、邵堤堵築工程、十五因風雨停工一日、邵伯鎭全市、遍地瓦礫、仍不免有腐屍汆入、該鎭水災救濟會、爲交通衛生計、已派夫清理街道、冲洗腐臭、一面查明災民人數、逐日施粥、此外被災最重之興化縣、尙有災民三十萬人、内有二千人、集該縣大堂待振、該縣華縣長無法、乃電告蘇義振會、謂將待船隻運揚、此間辦事處、亦因無地收容、已電總會請示、揚鎭交通十五日完全停頓、滬上報紙亦未到、聞因下游民衆、怵於江潮倒灌、輪浪刷堤、十五日又發生鳴鑼聚衆風潮、現各輪公司、議决暫開鎭清鎭郵班、（鎭揚短班暫停）泰縣方面之泰興泰東泰鹽三輪班、因難民待運、已由大達大生大源姜泰四公司、議定開班、附售助賑通行證、裝儎旅客、十六日實行、</p>

<h3>皖省府正式辦理特稅</h3>
<p>蕪湖通信、安徽禁烟問題、自中央禁烟委員會設立禁烟查緝處於蚌蕪大通安慶各處、委郝子華爲處長後、皖人以爲係變相之鴉片公賣、呼號反對、其後禁烟會與行政院同時明令、將該處撤銷、安徽省政府亦遵令通飭各縣、監視尅期撤廢、當時查緝處所擬創辦之各鄕鎭查緝分所、亦曾倐然中止、顧查緝處雖中央明令撤銷、而郝子華則奔走於省蚌兩方、態度非常積極、而查緝總處與省蕪分處、亦進行如故、查緝徵捐、工作反益緊張、一切均由科長孔其中主持、該項稅欵、是否仍舊向中央報解、抑係直接解送安慶、則不得而知、同時查緝處易名改組之說、亦盛傳一時、果也上週省府二一四次會議、提出討論、因已得蔣總司令之批准、遂正式通過安徽省創辦特稅處、仍委郝子華爲處長、省府之所以必辦特稅、或亦爲環境所造成、據特稅處方面宣傳、則謂皖省本年水災奇重、哀鴻遍野、待賑孔殷、禁烟固宜厲行、振濟尤爲急務、禁絶之法首重清釐、查本省私種各户、固干法紀、但値此災情嚴重之秋、旣經收穫、倘不予以變通、不但毒品屯積、貽患無窮、而人民一線生機、陷於絶境、茲爲寬其旣往、嚴禁將來、俾毒品藉以肅清、災黎因之救濟、特參酌豫鄂成案、辦理特稅、此案通過後、郝即電召科長孔其中由蕪赴省、擬定章則、積極籌備、總處本仍設蕪湖、惟因大水未退、辦理不便、已擬暫設蚌埠、但蕪湖濱臨長江、爲特貨進出口總樞、决先設分處辦公、現該處已將上項創辦原因、擬定佈告、曉諭皖人、並令特商以及種吸各户、一律遵守定章、勿圖倖免矣、（十六日）</p>
<h3>第三國際與蘇俄之陰謀</h3>
<p>（八續）</p>
<p>（問）對於這些事情、你的意見究竟若何、（答）我們務必立派一同志前往、呌他注意我們所定的羣衆工作、並須依照共産國際的條例、至於政治工作的人、已不嫌其少、凡已被派往的同志、均當暫留該處、我們又必再派一軍事同志但我們這些軍隊大可不必用以攻敵、只須注意改正我們的陣綫、求得在農民間工作的確當方法與策略、以實踐均由革命之責、彼處農民須加以組織、給以軍籌、以張我軍的聲勢、而關於經商的策略、亦須變更、我們以爲在現在時局中、此爲最重要最　當的辦法、不過這個問題尙未經政治局討論、只是我們的意見罷了、</p>
<p>（問）我們就在下次政治局開會時、提出討論、並加以說明、</p>
<p>莫斯金、若說敵軍如何得勢、我軍如何不敵、未免是同志們言之過甚、據我看來、彼處的形勢、確已是極感困難、假如我們不能使我軍振作聲勢、以保閩西、則我們將喪失一極可靠的根據地、敵人反得整軍畫策、來攻我中區了、莫斯金因之主張改變進行路綫、擬從湘西南逕往荼陵、現在我黨第二十軍團在該處譁變、他希望至該團作短時間運動、擇其最良之部分帶回赤軍、而再往朱毛處、計由上海至荼陵不過十日、再往朱毛處又十日、共二十日、</p>
<p>第七團消息　有一同志已由此團經廣東而至、詳細報告尙未接到、但我們知道第七團於一九三○年（民國十九年）九月已有五千人、槍三千枝、决定與朱毛聯合、故嘗由廣西取道而至湘省之西南、未幾又由湘南回桂、東向而至粤北、當該同志離團而來、其團部乃在贛省西南、彼等前後所經之路、在二千英哩以上、途中於農工人民之間、並未作何工作、其唯一的任務與目的、不過欲投朱德毛澤東罷、該團與敵戰過多次、俱被打敗、現僅存一千人、槍七百枝、</p>
<p>麥特諾已赴賀龍處、曾來一函、陳述因船發生困難、必須遲緩五日始到、想今日必能與賀龍會面、再格得柯等已向第一團而去、惟尙未接到彼等來信、</p>
<p>江西東北部第十團亦有報告送來、謂羅章龍（譯音）已在該處聯合成功、開始工作、最近派往第十團之政治行員、有帮助羅章龍的嫌疑、</p>
<p>大會對於第二十團的决議案　關於第二十團的問題、已經一致同意、又議及同志間須彼此信任、及與羅章龍作戰等事、此議案將用政治局名義、通告各紅軍、</p>
<p>期必列特諾夫現往第一團、莫期金對彼此行、有些疑慮、以爲此舉於政治局的工作很有妨礙、但我意期氏此行、確有幾種特别作用、現已找到一隻好的汽船、在若干時期内、這班同志們將决定如何繼續前行Cyl秘書亦將與彼同行、</p>
<p>斯必列特諾夫要求開一特别會議、討論我第一團駐區内之軍略問題、但此區内之情形、我們不很熟悉、該區農民運動甚烈、我們並無勢力可以操縱、而各村中的階級意見如何不同、亦不得而知、聽說有許多反赤軍隊、我們究竟實行什麽策略去對付呢、我們在該處的軍事經騐甚弱、在中區我們只須打一個軍閥團體、而在第一團的駐區、乃要敵幾個軍閥團體、他們不能聯絡、故我們的戰略、須必更有伸縮、相機而行、此乃一定不易之理、惟地理作戰情形、確是利於敵、而不利於我、敵一方由鐵道而來、一方由江河而來、運人運械俱極便利、平漢路上我們有二十個同志、中有一人係黨團之領袖、軍事上的策略與行動、我們正要請軍事同志的指敎、而對於各處匪軍、我們應如何聯絡、如何對付、亦須請示機宜、該處土匪甚多、我們有兩種意見、如見他們可用、就准他們的匪軍用赤軍名義赤軍口號而行事、亦未嘗不可、當時格得柯曾表示反對、說與此等土匪不可發生政治上的關係、亦不可有組織上的關係、故此問題必須經大會决定、</p>
<p>對付農民的方策、在第一團駐區内農民運動、已很發展、有許多農民協會、例如在皖西有一個極盛的農民協會、我們現方利用此會、做我們很好的工作、但從别方面注意、此會的領袖、確有另成一派的傾向、我們究應如何行事、須得有明白的指導、</p>
<p>最後論到黨務工作人員的職務問題、第一團内黨的工作、至今毫無成績、究竟誰負其責、我們並不知悉、以是須派許多同志去好好的組織、（問）第一團駐區的工作、我們曾有記錄、現在第一重要者、必須變更方法、改善其工作、政治工作及羣衆工作的方法、原是分明的、且有第三國際所定的條例可稽、此等問題、吾人已向你們說過好多次、現我們根據各項定章、凖備給你們擬定一個詳細的辦法、此雖不過一種草案、而你們確可藉此以解决許多軍事問題、倘有其他問題、爲此項辦法中所未曾提及者、則由你們决定、相機辦理可也、你們必須預備人員、速即派往第一團工作、至於需用何種人員、則此項訓令内亦已載明、</p>
<p>莫斯金　前曾議决、……四…之前、當派同志二十七人、在蘇維埃各區内負責辦理軍事與政治的工作、中有一部分係指派至第一軍團者、斯必列特諾夫同志所擬第一團工作的辦法、可謂大致不差、惟請與負責軍事之同志再舉行一次特别會議以商榷之、</p>
<p>（四六）四月七號與向（忠發）及哥魯平之談話　　向（以下係彼之談話）中央委員會擔任内部連絡之某同志、係於四月五號（星期日）被捕、地點係在某一職工會之屋内、彼被捕時、曾抄出遼寗監獄内各同志致紅色救濟會函一件、省委員會函一件、（内容無由知悉）中央委員會致全國勞工會函一件、洋一千元、安徽省委會地址一件、中央委員會各組工作同志之收據一件、當彼被捕後警察即常川守候該處、故不久又有同志七人被獲、在此七人中、有一人爲全國勞工會行動員聯絡主任、一爲紅色救濟會之聯絡員、一爲失業工人之指導員、其餘爲中央委員會個人之聯絡員（其中有女子一人）其第一人之被捕、實係輕於冒險所致、（阿斯德當訊以何云冒險、但向僅答據某方之報告如此）、向繼稱、此被捕之同志、在中央委員會工作已久、故信任特深、在一千九百二十七年彼曾爲向之私人秘書、以是彼對於現負各處重要工作三十一人之地址、皆甚熟悉、（其中二十二人係在中央委員會各組工作、三人在省委員會、四人在職工會、二人在紅色救濟會）彼等旣熟悉吾人之住址、故不得不立即遷徙、同時并知會省委會技術部、别覓新屋、向又稱爲迅速實行此種計劃起見、彼曾在某旅館中召集一度會議、到會人數有各區聯絡主任·省委私人聯絡員·上海聯絡主任·以及省委會某技術秘書、彼等爲避免别人注意起見、乃不得不於討論中、大呼大喝、乃不幸因此而引起守人之干涉、並召來警察</p>
<p>阿斯德　何以少數人被捕、君竟惶急若是、君得毋冒昧以不忠實之同志、擔任此種重要工作、遂致不能信任彼等耶、</p>
<p>向　因第一被捕之同志深悉吾等之情形、而彼之爲人、又甚脆弱、故吾人不能不謹愼將事、</p>
<p>阿斯德　君得毋未聞中央委員會之聯絡工作、無須如此辦理、何以有如此其多之聯絡主任、現在究有若干、且在中央委員會之同志、對於彼等之生活費、何以必須掣取收據、此種收據抑又何用、我意此種聯絡主任當立即取銷、且不能再授彼等以何種名義、因旣有主任、則主任之下、勢必又須設置若干之秘書、循此以往、吾人不又將增加一筆巨大之經費乎、黨的金錢、必須按照整個的需要、以定分配之標準、實不能偏重於任何方面即中央委員會所雇用之若干同志、亦未嘗不應如此、關於此點、吾人已屢向君提及、殊不料直至今日、尙復如是、况人數旣少、則一方面可以節省金錢、一方面又可以免除危險、</p>
<p>向　我等亦曾盡力設法减少各處之職員、但迄今殊無效果、蓋此種問題、談之甚易、行之則甚困難也况環境如此、若無如許之人員、聯絡之責行、則不將更形束手耶、</p>
<p>阿斯德　君不妨將此項問題交局辦理、再參照吾等之計劃行之、君可設法將現有之一百五十人至少减去一半、總以每一同志皆能有其效用、且在工作上能得到正確之分配爲原則、</p>
<p>向　馮（玉祥）近曾遣代表二人、與吾等接洽、其中一人從前係吾等之同志、彼向吾等接洽之目的何在、尙不清楚、莫斯金本日曾與前係我等同志之一人、作一度之談話、僅知馮現已覺察彼過去之錯誤、極昐吾等與以援助而已、再馮將來擬由西伯利亞往柏林一行、前國民軍第二師師長龐某、（現在上海）及譚部、亦皆有與我等取聯絡之傾向、此種問題、尙須大會之指示、</p>
<p>阿斯德　君可立將莫斯金與該代表談話之結果、以及上述其他等人之目的、作一報告、我等始能有所根據、今日我所亟欲向君提及者、實爲前次吾人與君之函、因敵方現正努力消滅及分化紅軍之内部也、關於此點、實應非常注意、目前敵方代表三人同時覓吾等接洽、毋乃太奇、吾人在各方面皆應謹愼、勿輕易與彼等訂約、或應允任何條件、至多只可以利用彼等、吾人須切記彼等乃吾等之敵、而非吾等之友、甚或因我人現正有同志在彼等部隊中工作、而急謀有以愚弄我等也、俟君之報告遞到時、吾等當再爲詳盡之考慮、</p>
<p>向　吾等近又接得某項報告、謂有若干同志、現正與岳維峻部下之軍官接洽、（按岳本人前已在平漢路、爲我方截獲）負責接洽者、爲該部軍官彭某、彼等願以十萬元贖回岳氏、</p>
<p>阿斯德　君可迅即通知第一軍團之同志、囑彼等謹愼行事最要之點、在於嚴密監禁岳氏、而勿令其脫逃、并囑彼等勿殺此人、因殺之亦無用也、吾人須將彼留下、作爲一種擔保、</p>
<p>向　吾等近派童明宣（譯音）同志往河南、擔任秘書、彼原係上海之紡織工人、前以事被捕、嘗鐵窗風味一年、現在甫經出獄彼實爲一最好之同志、</p>
<p>阿斯德　彼在被捕之前、究作何種工作、彼出獄之日、果係何時、現在是否已充分恢復原狀、就政治的方面而言、彼是否有堅毅之精神、</p>
<p>向及哥　彼在被捕之前、係某一小組之秘書、在今年元旦始經釋放、出獄後仍照常工作、并且完畢黨内某種短期的訓練、</p>
<p>阿斯德　頂好在彼未往河南之前、能假以時日、藉資休息、彼之用度、當然由紅色救濟會供給、總之吾人須先扶助同志恢復健康、然後裕其日用之資、始能得到實效、</p>
<p>最近各項罷工之報告</p>
<p>最近二十四家絲廠之罷工、全係同時發動的、彼時與吾等有聯絡者、不過工廠四家、女工七人而已、青年同志亦僅與女工二人有聯絡、在某一絲廠内、有女工十二人、彼此甚爲密切、現在設法接近、此外吾人尙有公開的女工學校一所、至前述之七人、有四人係我等之同志、但膽量殊不濟事、區委員會給與彼等之工作及指導、大都不能進行、即開會時、彼等亦不出席、黨部原許彼等每出席會議一次、與銀一元、現已停止付給、故彼等亦遂拒絶出席、在罷工期中、吾人實未做一點工作、此次罷工、雖係同時發動、但爲時甚暫、最多亦不過三日即行復工、國民黨在此次罷工時、曾强迫一家絲廠復工、其餘復工之絲廠、則係工人自動、因之彼等之目的完全未達、僅有一家容納八百工人之絲廠、允增加工次百分之五十而已、吾人逆料此種罷工不久仍將重演一過、故現已從事準備一切、（未完）</p>

<p>丨登高一呼戰士奮發丨</p>
<p>務本勝敗利鈍、端賴是戰、榮譽所繫、固不在一隊而在整個學校團體耳、惟是球戰每以銳氣爲轉移、不張軍威、安望勝利、身不能執戈前驅、亦宜呼喊助勢、略盡天職、上下一致、成羣結隊、集於場之東隅台上、四五百人、巍然成一人山、登高一呼、聲震四野、戰士氣𦦨高、聲勢盛、敗中奮鬥、初成均勢、再接再厲、卒致成功、戰士努力之結果、亦同伴助威之所致也、</p>
<p>（二）務本隊人才平均</p>
<p>丨全體一致進退有方丨</p>
<p>務本戰勝海星、良非易事、第一排王張李三人、出手敏捷、張壁如擋球尤佳、第二排薛志潔全隊魂　、托繫劈壓各技、莫不純熟、大有姜太公在此百無禁忌之慨、惜手指舊創未愈、否則或有更妙之成績、錢書　在其左、供球有力、得分頗多、右有諸尙復、比較略軟、然最後大功告成、出其手中、是福將也、第三排救球工夫絶佳、能救球等於能發球、　均可賴以獲分取勝也、王金鳳善於回擋、絶處逃生、是是拿手、左右甬輔、亦能無愧　　、全隊人才、　　平均、合作工作、一時　匹、至於策略高妙、進退有方、是乃李飛雲指導之力、全隊名單如左、</p>

<p>（三）海星隊時運不濟</p>
<p>丨各個佳妙合作欠缺丨</p>
<p>海星隊會聚各校之精華、各個人才超衆、有口皆碑、惟是成軍未久、合作欠缺、第三第四兩盤、時運不濟、功敗垂成、第一排汪能春、第二排關柳珠司徒薇黄杏芬等之表演、全場贊許、分排而論、第一排回擋甚佳、第二排劈擊有力、第三排挽救無方、全隊或散或聚、隙漏累見、失敗之故、半由於此、敎練李信標一再授機、難挽汪瀾、全隊名單如左、</p>

<p>獲女排球錦標之務本隊（本館攝）</p>
<p>（四）負盛名奪關破壘</p>
<p>丨海星先勝爲勢甚易丨</p>
<p>開塲務本供球、洪若春回手一擊、適中要害、奪得一分、侯毓芬加十二分、海星三比○占先、聲勢甚壯、繼成六比二、未幾十一比六換地、務本震於敵之盛名、頗呈慌亂之象、滿目荆棘、舉步艱難、海星無往不利、每役必克、汪若春司徒薇功績最巨、前後三排、整齊可觀、其勝敵也、爲勢甚易、結果海星二十一比十四勝第一盤、第二盤之初、務本仍未得勢、迨至錢書儀發球、始自五五平數、扶搖直上、其功在第一排之變化無窮、務本十一比六之後、銳氣尤盛、薛志潔領導全隊、奮發有爲、不久二十一比十六反勝第二盤、</p>
<p>（五）合全力克敵制勝</p>
<p>丨反敗爲勝務本成功丨</p>
<p>第三第四兩盤緊張異常、海星賴各個技能、以謀發展、務本以合作功夫、而資對付、開塲海星四比一占先、務本後隨、九九平數之後、又有十三等數、海星每占先著、務本則亦步亦趨、最後務本第三排之得力、乃得二十一比十九再勝第三盤、第四盤、兩隊初甚相持、嗣後海星迭進、曾以十一比九、十七比十三、高出於前、乃務本合作、忽然大見聯絡、絶處逢生、最後以二十一比十九獲勝、裁判譚天沛、</p>

<h3>（一）持志克服强敵</h3>
<p>青光三十三比三十七敗</p>
<p>人氣狂熱中、持志青光開始接戰、青光上塲甚順、持志力挫之、以十五比十四、上半時勝一分、下半時青光雖曾一度超出、持志以純熟敏捷之合作工夫、終以三十七三十一克服青光、而錦標呼聲、於以高出、</p>
<p>兩路進兵青光得勢　談達鎭以錢鼎愼之犯規、先得一分、進退移時、青光沿邊自左右進、左衛張錦祥遠射、竟爾中的、徐克培在極角反手一球、亦然破網、青光連得五分、勢不可當、時僅二分鐘、</p>
<p>持志反攻一分佔先　持志見勢不佳、乃呌息計議、果然五人一氣呵成、見隙即鑽、乘機即進、大舉反攻、一下而連中六球、青光至此亦遣將調兵、以陸大振余邭子調人、而改變戰略、運用各個防擊政策、一個跟一、個一步不放鬆、果然持志盛勢、爲之一緩、上半時持志以十五比十四勝一分、</p>
<p>青光中興曇花一現　下半時初起、青光突現中興氣象、徐克培而余邭子而張錦祥、相繼建功、頓時二十二比十八超出、其勢正盛、而持志又要求休息、球勢爲一挫、持志則反扶搖直上、一帆風順、青光之中興、過眼烟雲而已、</p>
<p>持志三鋒神乎其技　持志之勝、快不可當而已、錢楊二鋒、前進如飛、一球在手、不及轉眼、已在籃前、身手之敏妙、目今當稱罕見、而孔廣益之進退裕如、能攻能守、談達鏵亦竟何如之何、入後愈戰愈勇、毫不放鬆、青光連次爲其衝破、持志竟連得十一分、成二十九比二十二、迨後分數相差皆在七八分之間、青光已無法挽救、青光之敗無他、不及持志、身手之敏速、不及持志合作之純熟也、</p>

<h3>（二）滬江盛極一時</h3>
<p>曁南四十五比五十六敗滬江曁南繼之作戰、初相持可十分鐘、曁南突然以二分超出、滬江乃以後衛陸王二大將應援、遂大敗曁南、興趣較上組大遜、而得决賽權、比數五十六比四十五、</p>
<p>曁南以二分超出　滬江開始猛攻、三鋒銜枚疾走、曁南回防、陸鋪惠乘機襲進、沿右　射、一擊中的、李汝純繼之在左、滬江四比○先頭奪人、　海青黄兆霖挽回三分、滬江又以九比三遠上、曁南乃休息援兵、變更戰略、魏海青跳球、直拍籃前、黄兆霖趕上、連中三次、遂以十三比十一超出滬江二分、</p>
<p>滬江二大將應援　此計旣成、曁南氣𦦨頓高、形勢不佳、滬江乃急以後備軍二大將�</p>
<p>參戰、陸鍾恩王錫良出守後開、二虎坐鎭、後顧無憂、前鋒乃恣意進攻、十五比十九後、曁南遂一落而不堪復起矣、上半時滬江三十三比十九勝、</p>
<p>出没無常之三將　下半時曁南李城元仍由蔡榮瑞黑將入替、魏海青雖撲中一球、而滬江之三少年將軍、憑其妙敏之身手、如飛之脚步、仍出没無常於曁南之陣地、一連而得十分、至是滬江以四十四比二十一前去萬里矣、</p>
<p>曁南疏於防守敗　曁南敗象已成、挽回良非易事矣、黄兆霖雖遠射連中壟擊成功、病入膏盲、終歸無效、惟分數漸見接近、滬江以五十六比四十五勝、滬江之勝、當然在二衛之充補、而錢敬鏞馮念華之神妙射籃、得心應手、每發必中、神乎其技、曁南處以銳利無比之衝鋒下、守衛毫不嚴密、否則至少可减滬江之得分、而擲射欠準、尤爲曁南失敗之大因、</p>

<h3>女子籃球二週賽兩江大勝曁南</h3>
<p>二十二對九</p>
<p>球類比賽一幕幕遇去、空氣逐漸緊張、昨日籃球比賽、本定六時起賽但四時左右、鶴立於籃球房門外、候買票入塲者、大有人在、至務本與海星在田徑塲决賽完畢時、來者益形擁擠至五時左右、籃球房内、已難尋挿足之地、六時後、欲進而不得進者、不知幾許人、此種情形、於辦事上雖感困難、但於體育上確爲好現象也、</p>
<p>丨劇戰詳情丨</p>
<p>第一節　裁判員周家騏下令開戰、十二位小姐、分佈塲中、你看守我、我看守你、變成六對、互相追隨、在鼓掌聲中、兩江楊仁女士首先擲中、隨開紀錄、曁南劉瑪琍女士、身材高大、體力雄偉、東奔西馳、技術實爲曁有之冠、惜同隊前鋒、技術不甚平均、故有孤掌難鳴之感、劇戰至第一節告終、兩江以八比三占優勝、</p>
<p>第二節　曁南後衛、忽告奮勇、打來頗爲出色、王蘭茵之截球與搶球尤爲全塲觀者所稱許、兩江雖有邵錦英·楊仁·龍競雄諸名將用盡三角傳球法、一時亦頗難得分、後方改變策略、將球傳回後方、以引曁南守衛者外出、然後再由邊線進攻、方以五比二取勝第二節、</p>
<p>第三節　戰鬥益形劇烈、球常在曁南之後方、以此曁南三後衛抵禦奔跑、幾無片刻停留、</p>
<p>但均能各盡厥職、使兩江前鋒、頗少擲籃機會、斯時兩江後衛、接應前方、甚爲得法、王蘭君屢有絶妙之動作、莊淑玉動中鎭靜、時有鶩人之表演、故苦戰八分鐘曁南一無所得、兩江亦僅得四分、由此可見當時競爭之劇烈矣、</p>
<p>第四節　兩江敎練、見記錄板上、高懸十七與五之比、兩江之勝利可無問題、乃將龍競雄向大威等　出、另補宋文城陳嘉鈞兩新將、加入比賽、故精彩較前爲少、但結果兩江仍以五比四得勝第四、節兹錄兩隊之成績表如下、</p>

<h3>棒球開幕賽立意戰勝約翰</h3>
<p>丨十二對七丨</p>
<p>棒球一道、在滬頗爲幼稚、故人才寥寥、本届市運動會、在開始籌備時、甚恐棒球比賽、無人加入、不料報名結果、有三隊加入、眞是喜出望外、昨日爲棒球開賽之第一幕、與賽者爲聖約翰大學對立意、結果約翰以七對十二之比敗北、記者深知閱報諸君、一定要疑問、立意究爲何人組織、其隊員是何許人、敢於述比賽情形以前作一簡單之介紹、</p>
<h3>介紹立意</h3>
<p>立意棒球隊、係由日回國、在滬經商之人組織、其中隊員有張景裴即張文、在日本横濱中華體育會、任外場員、在日時、頗有威名、現在滬上經商與張君同時回國者有魏錶即魏宗鏜、在中華體育會任投手、成績亦佳、并有李文煊陳光榮者亦由横濱中華體育會回國、現在均在引翔港、餘茂紗廠任職、此外有林文成君以前爲南華棒球隊之投手現在亦來滬經商、加入立意、故立意頗强、有奪標希望、惟似缺少練習、今日不知能否轉勝江灣、（復旦）殊難預組、且待今日比賽時再探虚實、</p>
<h3>比賽情形</h3>
<p>滬上人士對於棒球比賽、全無興趣、故參觀者、反無隊員之多、較之田徑塲之排球賽、人山人海、擠得水洩不通、籃球房之籃球賽、擁得滿坑壘谷、全無挿足之地、眞要令人氣熬、</p>
<p>昨日比賽、共分七局、在七局中、其最精彩者、厥爲第四局立意投手、有一本壑打、頃刻間跑回四人、分數由五比四變成九比四、時歡聲各作、日語中夾雜廣東語、聲浪頗高、蓋立意隊員、大半是在日之廣東華僑、先後回國經商者、其餘各局皆無甚精彩、茲附兩隊隊員之名戰以及各局之成績如下、</p>

<p>丨觀衆安靜</p>
<p>昨爲複賽及决賽之日、觀衆皆異常興奮、未及二時、立於臺之四周者、已不下千人、旋因排球開始、人數略减、然圍觀者猶衆、且自始至終嚴守秩序、</p>
<p>丨國術演講</p>
<p>當競賽之前市國術館少林主任佟忠義登台演講國術競賽之意義、詳述競賽時之舉動如何爲合法、如何爲不合法、以袪除觀衆之誤會、衆咸報之以掌聲、</p>
<p>丨歡迎摔角</p>
<p>摔角之精彩、報上已一再言之、故觀衆尤爲興奮、而複賽及决賽中、亦恰能令人呌絶、複賽首組爲洪志芳宋保茂洪之身手靈敏、已如前述、對手亦工夫老練、惟鈎法略遜、洪卒以二對一獲勝、次組爲劉欽俊對王昇、劉之身碩力大、王本非其敵、惟王摔法較佳、卒能相持至再、結果仍爲劉敗劉比勝王複與洪志芳二人之長短相若、摔法亦以洪爲佳、惟力不如劉、終爲其將腿抱持及以壓倒法、而連倒二回、甚矣實力派之可畏也、</p>
<p>丨爲眞劍術</p>
<p>擊劍首組爲陸子山與沈佛林次爲王杏蓀與奚俊才、皆能使用步法身法、惟沈奚二人、各堕劍一次未免大意、决賽之時陸子山與王杏蓀、各用活步、閃擊靈敏異常、有看客喝采曰、此爲眞劍術、</p>
<p>丨最後一擊</p>
<p>輕量級搏擊、昨日只有三組、輕中量級、僅有一組、輕量級中以二六號竺清鏞爲最出色、與其對手一號蜀少浙决賽時、拳如雨點、連擊不已、蜀身軀略小、惟亦非弱者、一次失敗後、裁判員詢其願再比否仍昂然答曰、「再比」、惟究以力遜不敵、下台後精神疲敝、救護隊以檯床臥之、飲以藥水、並用救護車送其返寓、輕中量級之譚弈嘉擊法、尤爲出色、劉鳳鳴固國術健者、雖拳腿并用、然必伺隙而擊、不及對方得點之多、故搏擊錦標、仍屬諸竺清鏞譚弈嘉二人、皆最後努力之功也、</p>
<p>丨國術競賽總評</p>
<p>此次國術競賽、在中國爲破天荒之舉、其成績不能驚人自在意中、惟此次獲得錦標各人、如劉欽俊譚奕嘉等、尙不可謂非差强人意、女子錦標、則以人少而幸得其一、無對手競賽、由大會保送參加全國運動會、其一雖經競賽而擊法、幼稚無可諱言、滐望女界特别注意設備方面、其護具一項、係採現代軍隊擊劍所通用者、蓋國術本身尙無適當之護具、此後似當逐漸研究、以免東洋貨之譏搏擊競賽評者、以爲非中非西、蓋爲皮手套而設、然無皮套、則對方必致受傷、有手套則方法不能盡用、此爲以後國術競賽最大問題、甚望國術館當局加以精密之研究也、</p>
<p>丨給奬消息</p>
<p>據大會消息給奬、日期須至二十日以後、地點已擇定市商會、凡國術錦標得奘者、届時當由大會或市國術館通知、此外技術優良、而未得錦標者、亦由國術館擇期給奬以資鼓勵、</p>

<h3>佛羅稜薩的敎授</h3>
<p>伽利略發現木星的四個月亮之後，便寫了一篇文字於一六一○年一月二十四日在星座報告Nuncius　Siderius裏面發表出來。</p>
<p>這篇破天荒的文字出版之後，照現在看來，該是多麽的寳貴，佛羅稜蕯Florence的大學敎授們却看牠不起。</p>
<p>法赫在伽利略傳中說帕雕亞Padua的哲學主任敎授用盡力量使大公爵不要相信木星四月之存在，他說：</p>
<p>「動物頭上有七竅，通氣於周身，使牠明，使牠煖，使牠滋長。這小宇宙之七竅是什麽？兩個鼻孔，兩個眼睛，兩個耳朶，一張嘴。同時，在諸天之大宇宙中有兩顆吉星，兩顆凶星，兩顆發光的星，一顆超然未决的水星。這種類似之處，數不勝數，比如七金，即爲一例；因此我們斷定行星之數必爲七顆無疑。何况木星的月亮不是人眼所看見，所以在地上不能發生影響，所以無用，所以存在。而且猶太人，古代民族以及近代之歐羅巴人已定七天爲一星期，並將七行星之名字稱呼牠們。如果我們將行星增加起來，豈不是把這美麗的系統整個的推翻了嗎？」</p>
<p>伽利略自已說：</p>
<p>「我想請佛羅稜蕯的敎授們來看木星的四衛星，他們不但不願意看星，連我的遠鏡也不願看。他們相信在自然裏没有眞理可找，眞理只在書本裏。」</p>
<p>中國的敎授，有那幾位不是從佛羅稜蕯來的呀？國産的老夫子說：「眞理只在古書裏。」留洋的洋翰林說：「眞理只在洋書裏。」懶得看書的講師說：「眞理只在嘴巴裏。」青年學生若信這些敎授們的話也就可算是佛羅稜蕯入藉的學生了。誰能自造儀器向大自然錨準？如有這人我是願意拿着掃帚做他的齋夫了。</p>
<h3>世界小事記</h3>
<p>歐洲的高爾夫球熱現在上海流行的小高爾夫球。盛極一時。其源出於大高爾夫球。據考據所得。歐洲大陸在三百年前。即有高爾夫球。荷蘭大畫家藍伯偷氏Rembrandt的畫中。就有打高爾夫球的游戲。不過畫中人所用的球棒是古式的。與現代的有些不同罷了。打高爾夫球。本是一種貴族式的游戲。因爲占地極廣。小小的塲子不夠盤旋。所以歐美的高爾夫俱樂部。取費很多。非富人不能問津。可是近來英國方面的高爾夫俱樂部。因鑒於愛玩高爾夫球的人太多。打算將入會費减少。以便普遍。而小國如宇古斯拉夫Yugoslav也在流行高爾夫球。他們的第一個高爾夫球塲。近在柴格來Zagreb開幕。一般球迷。趨之若鶩。</p>
<p>美國的犯罪熱　美國的大寳業很多。最近又加上了一項。就是犯罪。據英國某周刊說。美國人以犯罪爲生活的。有一百萬人之多。每年發生的案件。計謀殺案一萬二千起。攔刦案十萬起。盜竊案五十萬起。（海客）</p>
<h3>一頁匪區的慘報告</h3>
<p>— 棲鳳樓主</p>
<p>余友唐君。服務於國民軍第九師部。月前奉令隨從蔣師長出發贛邑剿匪。千里行軍。辛勞倍至。茲獲其自興國轉南昌來函。備述災區狀况。逹數千言。讀之令人慘惻。茲擇其尤者。摘錄數端如下。</p>
<p>唐函云。「我們所過各縣。以興國災情最重。當我們初到時。（去克復時還不到一個星期）這座空城我想誰多不願意來吧。現在我單把這地方的情况。約略一說。查此縣在未被匪之前。居民逹二萬餘。現在盡其量還不上三百人。其中女性的要佔三分之二以上。男的多老而不能工作者。和有殘疾的居其多數。說起我們的給養問題。眞算困難到萬分。除了向鄕間搜集的。祇有柴米二項。其最主要的油鹽。竟至無從採辦。因此吃淡飯已有多天了。其中有被匪未逃的民衆。他們在從前收藏起來的日用品。（很少數）他的取價之昻。眞是奇聞。我也附帶來報告一下。美麗烟每聽二元。鹽每斤一元。洋燭每包半元。白糖每斤一元。起碼襪一元兩雙。火油每聽十四元。可說是貴極了。市上早已十室十空。凄慘萬狀。比較好些的房子。都被飛機炸彈炸燬。全市還有兩爿藥舖。藥品也配不齊。一爿紙舖。賣賣底貨而已。其他舖子一槪没有。我們的隊伍。就駐在沿街店舖的空屋裏。「中略」共産黨的宣傳標語。到處都有。甚而至於厠所糞坑邊也都貼滿。他最有趣的一條。就是「反對老公打老婆」。豈不是笑話嗎。還有「打倒取銷派」「消滅AB團」「………」。這都是共産黨内部分裂最顯明的一種。聞說興國一縣。托辣司基派的AB團本有五六千衆現在首領胡某。已在廣昌被彭德懷所殺斃了。」云云。嗟乎。方今全國洪濤爲患。災地人民。九死一生。奈何又增以匪患。層疊煎逼。吾民誠無噍類矣。</p>
<h3>大雅樓雅叙拾零</h3>
<p>— 梅</p>
<p>石路三馬路轉角有一綢緞局焉。名曰大新。蓋取意夫大學所謂「苟日新。日日新。又日新」之涵義也。局主王延松氏以該局於九月二十二日爲擴大營業後一週紀念之期。除吩咐所屬籌備熱烈之週年紀念大廉價外。並擬發行特刊。以資流傳。爰於上月初旬登報徵文當代。命題爲「救濟國産綢緞之我見。」又一爲「對於大新綢緞局之希望」。良欲藉高文之華貴。播拯救之長策。其用心亦云苦矣。隔昨徵文截止。局主邀請文壇有道在大雅樓舉行評判會議。勝會不常。不可無記。爰述數則。以實本談。</p>
<p>評判員自命主考官　是晚與會者有潘公展胡庶華·王曉籟·方椒伯·嚴獨鶴。周慶鵑·嚴諤聲·王孝英等。王曉籟氏入門時。大呼主考官來了。繼又謂主考官不易做。恐被罰薪三個月也。其語可謂滑稽矣。</p>
<p>小記者做開路先鋒　此次評判。係由各評判員個别評分。再以總分平均之。以定名次之先後·但每篇作品之首先評分者。最難下手。新聞報小記者乃被推爲開路先鋒。首定分數。各主考官之見地。雖互有不同。但先入爲主之心理。非無影響。結果。總評後之名次。與小記者所定之分數。無多出入·小記者之爲力大矣。</p>
<p>唐乃炘大被賞識　女界應徵之作品有七十餘件。其中以上海法學院三年級生唐乃圻之作品爲最佳。洋洋數千言。頗有見地。各主考官之評分。均在九十六分以上。方考官竟予九十九分之多。衆質之。曰「唐女士尙在求學時代。且係研究法律。而今竟能侃侃而述救濟國綢之方策如此其詳且盡。焉可不加分哉。」唐女士被各考官如此賞識。不禁爲唐女士前途慶幸也。</p>
<p>謝移酬助賑諸君　天虚我生六八兩月稿費洋三十九元八角八分。賀天健君八月份洋二元。張善孖君八月份洋九角。逹籽庵君七月份洋一元。蘭茜君八月份洋七角二分。共計大洋四十四元五角。已遵囑送金城銀行代收。撥充賑欵。收條代存備查。特此玻露。謹代災民叩謝。自由談編輯部啟。</p>
<h3>扶桑雜記</h3>
<p>— 艾艾自東京寄</p>
<p>咖啡女郎的魔力</p>
<p>初到日本的人。一定要非常的奇怪。爲什麽日本人丨尤其是日本的青年學生丨這樣喜歡喝咖啡。當我們走到一個大學區域時。我們首先發見的。便是那些門面帶着未來派圖案式的小咖啡店這個正好比拿破崙在未發現新大陸以前。先發現一些樹枝水草。是一樣有趣的故事。</p>
<p>據日本警視廳的調查。截至本年三月爲止。單是東京一地。現有咖啡店三千二百十五家。咖啡女給（女招待）二萬零四十三人。要是我們能將每日出入咖啡店的客人的消費數。加以統計。必定是一個可驚的數目呢。</p>
<p>咖啡店因爲開設多了。營業競爭。是非常的劇烈·他們丨咖啡店的老　們。鈎心鬥角的力求佈置的。特别新奇。有的把客座裝飾得古香古色。好像在開着古董展覽會。有的是歐化的尖端。最近在銀座丨日本的百老匯路丨又有一家呌做日輪的咖啡店開幕。長虹萬道的招牌。照得人眼花撩亂。然而那内部的佈置。却驕陽不入。幽遠得像一座森林。慘綠的燈光。放着無限的凉意。妖嬈的女郎們的歌聲。在誘惑着來往的行人。據說日輪咖啡店第一日開幕的收入。將近二千元。誰相信日本在問着不景氣呢。</p>
<p>很多的有心人。對於青年們的浪漫。對於這醇酒婦人的享樂者的增加。常常表示憂慮和慨嘆。但是在政府方面。却以爲與其讓青年們閒空着去研究馬克思牛克思。幹那些開會結社的勾當。對於這種逢塲作戲的事情。樂得不聞不問。</p>
<p>咖啡店的發達。這不是偶然的。一方面青年們需要着異性的安慰。而這些妖媚的女郎却是細膩熨貼的解語花。一方面女性爲求職業心的迫切。而職業中最易賺錢的。當然是「咖啡女給。」同時伊們的副目的。可以順手牽羊在這熙熙攘攘的顧客中去尋找伊們理想的愛人。所以從前當「咖啡女給」者。不遇是些高小畢業生。現在連女敎師女大學生。也有充「咖啡女給」的了。日本女子在　女時代。本就無所謂貞操。伊們以爲這一時的賣笑。是無妨的。伊們已深忘却自已的可憐。而輕恕着人們的罪惡。</p>
<p>華燈初上。那成千整萬的女郎。都已經整備好了。伊們的晚妝。烏油油的鬢上。挿着凄艶的鬢花。嬌嫰的面龐。薄薄地匀上了臙脂。淡裝濃抹。百媚千嬌。伊們都是爲了金錢的着力。而注意地打扮着自已的容華。（本篇未完）</p>

<h3>丈夫的妻子（十六）</h3>
<p>— 江紅蕉</p>
<p>李李先生當了陳先生的面，究竟覺得不走是不行的，便說笑着走了。陳先生坐在靠窗的沙發上，默默地不作聲，瞧伊穿襪子，穿衣，洗臉等等，又足足化了一點鐘功夫。</p>
<p>「可以開飯了吧？」陳先生有些躁急了，他肚子裏眞閙着飢荒，他還是早晨七點鐘吃的東西。</p>
<p>「你好似三天没吃過東西的樣子，一天到晚，只聽得你閙着饑荒；我茶還没喝，飯怎麽咽得下？」伊說着又很忙的找茶葉找茉莉花，又生了火油爐煑水，直到下午兩點半鐘才用了中飯。</p>
<p>「今天是星期，去看電影吧！」伊像下聖旨一般的吩咐。</p>
<p>「我想寫幾封信呢。」</p>
<p>「一個男子，一天到晚躱在家裏，眞要躱出病來呢：你不去，我是要去的。」伊說着，又走到房門口喊了起來，「李先生！去看電影，好不好？」</p>
<p>「那麽李夫人也約了同去啊！」陳先生岔嘴說。</p>
<p>「伊老是不去，再去碰釘子麽？」</p>
<p>李先生果然穿得衣帽端正的來了。他開口便說；「我候了你半天咧。快走吧！遲了，又坐不到好位子。陳先生，怎麽你不去？」</p>
<p>「他眞是我的賢内助，他願意在家裏看管看管，由他吧！」陳夫人帶笑打趣，一壁在櫉裏找衣服更換。</p>
<p>「你說話眞有趣！你眞是一個男子，我假使是女子，我眞願意嫁給你做妻子。」陳先生也笑着打趣，</p>
<p>「女人？像你這樣的女人，女人眞倒了霉！」伊對着衣鏡在繫衣鈕，在衣鏡裏斜睨着陳先生和李先生。</p>
<p>「爲什麽？你瞧我，不是一個頂美麗的女人？」陳先生抹着自已上唇的卓别麟式鬍髭。</p>
<p>「天下的女人，有長着鬍髭的麽？」伊說得大家都笑了。</p>
<p>「陳先生，換衣服，同去！同去！」李先生拉着陳先生的手臂催促着，他明知陳先生是不會去的，過意裝做殷勤。</p>
<p>「我眞有些事，想趁今天星期辦完了，你們去吧，時候已不早咧。」陳先生心裏有些酸酸地刺激，還不便立刻發作出來。</p>

<p>昨日本埠證劵市場各債市况現市極清、惟二零關成交六千元、其他俱無交易、期市亦稍平靜、惟市上賣買進出不寂、統稅·鹽稅·二零關等成交仍旺、計前市開出一千零十餘萬、後市五百七十萬元、合計一千五百八十餘萬元、至言各債劵市價之變動情形、其趨勢平和、前後市盤旋無大漲落、惟以市上賣出活潑、而買氣沉靜、故各價盤旋漸疲、結果比前日除編遺價堅定、九六上落極微及二零關現貨比上週漲達一元七角外、餘如統稅鹽稅等均跌逾一元、其他亦小數角至五六角不等、債市形勢、似入盤旋狀態矣、</p>

<h3>紗花紗市稍帶俏象</h3>
<p>紗市仍無極大變化、但趨勢略爲堅緊、因大户在本月份有抵補之意、近月市氣較挺、遠月亦被其帶漲、然多數心理以四方水災嚴重、將後實需難免失望、所以一致抛空、惟廠商均觀望不動、以待變遷、再當舉動、</p>
<p>本月標大户補空　人標前市開盤、市氣極澹、人氣軟化、各月跌二錢惟遠月漲二錢、午後大户本月抵空、市氣帶堅、且三品紗漲、各月均漲·五·七錢、成交統計一萬七千六百五十包、查買出公泰一千一百包、天隆一千二百五十包、賡豐六百包、利昌三百包瑞大五百包、買進梅記一千四百包、德記七百包、賡豐五百五十包長豐四百五十包、茲將收盤價錄左、</p>

<h3>棉市形勢鬆折</h3>
<p>傅美有大量美棉借與我國說</p>
<p>棉市形勢略見軟弱、以外棉趨跌、傅美政府有美棉六十萬包賒與中國說於是賢方壓力愈重、散多吐出、然漢帮因該處水惠嚴重、損害劇烈、一時無貨可抵滬做多心思亦激昂、依然購進、然大勢狀况、十分悲觀、前途殊乏把握、</p>
<p>漢標大户競抛　漢標前市開盤、市况甚疲、以美棉又跌、收盤時、大户抛出、以美棉有賒欠我國說、各跌一二錢、午後平平、金市穩定、各月回漲五分、成交統計六萬一千八百担、杳賣出長和五千四百担、信誠五千三百担、裕大二千五百担、大昶五千四百担、買進厚豐三千九百担、愼昌二千七百担、瑞大二千四百担、新豐二千五百担、茲將收盤價錄左、</p>

<h3>糧食河下米市銷滯價疲</h3>
<p>南市　昨各帮來源略有、天時雖陰濕、城鄕店銷、緣中秋節將届、且北市價廉、進意頗呆、成交頓减、售性雖因天宫不正、市消不振、祗得略鬆、厚粳行情鮮高復修角餘、中次别重、薄稻到積尙有寗胃呆滯、本街亦取新鮮而已、中關竟呆、市價明定暗懈薄厚粳後形、照此天陰、出新阻礙、諒無大榮辱、新粳辦胃轉細、市勢續疲、新洋尖·新杜尖昨西塘到一儎計一百八十石、平望二筒、計一百六十石米品均佳新川尖角里貨到八石、尙可觀、價開十五元三角、新香粳亦到角里三十石、貨品美觀、價售十八元、</p>
<p>新閘　昨日常錫北粳來源續湧、河存略有、零胃因天時轉晴而稀少、人心看疲、厚粳早薄稻三種形勢回落一二角、新粳·新洋尖價削二三角、陳洋尖·杜尖·埠尖貨色雖少、但去胃寥寥、形無榮辱、通變·陰化貨仍凋零銷則平常、形呈庸象、洋米現銷稍動、形趨盤旋、</p>
<h3>期洋米有大批售開</h3>
<p>昨日洋客秈市况、因本街胃口略淡、洋行則有大批期貨開出、市面遂立見反動、期現各貨均爲疲小數分、計開出江西機二百十包、價十四元二角、台州白米六百包、價十二元七角半至十二元三角、敏當米三百包、價十三元二角半至十三元二角小絞一千包、價十三元○五分、期米昨日交易甚旺、均係洋行中售出、計裝一號西貢六百噸、目六兩七錢、由元利售出、沙遜售出十月份又三百噸、價六兩七錢一分、三井售出十月份小絞五百噸遠豐出又九百噸、價均六兩一錢半云</p>
<h3>標粉續向下游</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上下午開盤後、各月份市面、又呈疲滯續下之態、雖洋麥報價、回好二角左右、惟以市場籌碼之龐大、且大多數均屬業外、論其性質、需要如何、初不考慮、不過爲應時之投機也、迨至最近、以賑災之大批洋麥、旣經訂約、前途粉銷之不暢、自在意中、故多頭絶望之餘、祗好逐步反賣、以求了結、蓋此種買户、如果爲實銷之客帮、似乎尙可再擯、或則到期收現、當不致如是恐慌、自處絶境也、觀前途如俄麥再有成交、市面之衝動或須更進一步也、結果九十月份較前日跌七厘半、十一十二月份跌一分、一二月跌七厘半云、</p>
<h3>期麥市積重難返</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上下午開盤後、各月份市况、又趨續落之象、以市塲之情形、彷彿積重難返、有非跌不可之勢、兼傳某洋行、自已裝到之洋麥、已到一船、不久又須續到、因向廠家兜售無人問津、遂托經紀人向市塲套出此種賣户、鈍屬實貨、致人心益虚、大受打擊、查市場之趨勢、旣供多於求、各廠又袖手旁觀、所以將來之崩潰、或須一見也、結果本月份較前日跌二分、十·十一·十二月份各跌四分、一·二份各跌五分、現麥市面、沉寂以久、昨開出一萬六七千包、係預備交割、先行抽賣者、揚州·鎭江麥高至三兩六錢、次至三兩五錢半、高郵麥三兩四錢八分、由申大辦一萬包、華豐辦六千餘包、</p>
<h3>糖市太古糖漸露軋缺氣象</h3>
<p>昨日糖市産區電訊、古巴現糖價未變更、紐約期糖、近期回跌一分至三分、遠期五百份則反升三分、爪哇現期糖亦依然無升沉、公會劃盤荷糖二十四號粗砂白、買氣沉寂、出户殊湧、新貨喊十一兩六錢、新二十號中砂白十一兩一錢、俱少受手、十六號中砂白十兩○九錢、略有成交、市亦不奇、太古糖各處去化略暢、市存殊薄中檔貨更寥、大有軋缺最象、Ｂ嘜十一兩○五分、陳貨十二兩DY嘜十一兩九錢半、出户凋零、後市且喊十二兩者、HM嘜十一兩四錢七分半、市亦見緊、趨勢逐步、且廠盤奇緊、定貨價各、B嘜五元○五分、CW嘜五元、DY嘜四元九角半、HX嘜四元九角、HM嘜四元七角、H嘜四元六角、毫無通融餘地、行方進意雖有、但划價過昂、以致束手　誠有望洋興嘆之槪、是爲抵制劣貨聲中之别觀云、</p>
<h3>閘北貨新亳桃隨到隨銷</h3>
<p>新亳州桃、前日首批到六十七包、身份甚干、而個子亦好、旋爲寗波上江等帮如數辦通、價爲十八兩半、昨日二批復到四十包、貨品與前相仿茲値各帮均有需要、趨勢甚堅、或須再升云、</p>
<h3>絲茶洋莊絲市仍難進展</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊絲經交易、仍乏進展之勢、緣歐美各綢廠、日絲進額頗旺、對於黄白廠經、仍嫌價昂、而絲電不轉、市氣閒散、昨祇怡和等進滬白廠經二十包、達昌等進魯黄廠經十五包、價仍平定云、</p>
<h3>艮山門秋繭開始運滬</h3>
<p>浙杭新秋繭已上市多日、繭産因受天時之損害、仍難加增、拱宸橋及臨平·餘杭等處關行所收之鮮繭、因滬廠需要甚嚴、類均日夜烘製、積極運滬艮山門站存積之秋乾繭現已開始裝運、奈路局貨車、不敷預備、水陸並進、已有一部分由小輪拖運至滬云、</p>
<h3>貢熙綠茶交易尙旺</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊茶市、婺源·屯溪等路之貢熙綠茶、俄國協助會、搜買仍不遺餘力、新近設立之裕隆洋行、亦多有購進、全市成交一千二百餘箱交易頗形暢旺、珍眉珠茶等花色協和·同孚·杜德·永興等行、亦紛紛補進、市面轉趨活潑、華商鑒於存底枯薄、對於揑存手中之茶、均不願讓價求售、綠茶前途、至爲穩固云、</p>
<h3>疋頭格子法蘭羢被搜一空</h3>
<p>法蘭絨專銷夏季、當今秋凉之際、各種厚貨大衣呢陸續上市、法蘭絨應將落令、詎料近來格子法蘭絨、風行於市、售價突漲、考期緣由、本街帽子帮均有搜羅、以製小帽同時川帮亦起而採購、致趨勢驟緊、但全市所存在限、近三日來竟已搜羅一空矣、落令之貨、有斯活動、殊出人竟料之外也、</p>
<h3>五金大連帮趕辦黑鐵皮</h3>
<p>五金交易咋仍閑散、全市除少許點綴外、大宗買賣殊甚零落、惟異軍突起之大連帮、收辦黑鐵皮異常起勁、故對於全市頗堪告　、查該帮如怡隆成義成永日昇恒諸號帮、辦去共有二千二百五十捆之多、價則十八張每擔估十一兩、三六尺三張至八張估九兩四錢半、九張十張九兩七錢半、十一張十二張十兩○二錢半、十三張十一兩五錢、查該帮辦去尤以十八張爲最多、惟此貨存底奇薄、故後市標凖頗有繼續高漲之希望云、</p>

<h3>市監委會注意災民生活</h3>
<p>連日分頭調查</p>
<p>提出改進五點</p>
<p>市黨部監察委員會、鑒於各地洪水爲災、來滬難民爲數日多、雖已由政府設法收容、關於生活狀况、言人人殊、實堪注意、爰經派員連日分投往各收容所詳加調查、根據觀察所及、提出應行改進者五點、業經前日第五次監委會會議通過、函請執委會轉函社會局照辦、内容略謂、查斜土路潮惠山莊瞿眞人廟永錫堂等處收容所、本係臨時性質、設備自難求全、茲悉閘北柳營路災民收容所建築工程、行將告成、一俟佈置完畢、則斜土路臨時收容所災民、將全部移往閘北收集一處、管理衛生、似較優勝、惟觀察已往、覺紊亂錯雜、毫無秩序、應行改良之處、茲擇其最要者五點、分列於後、</p>
<p>給養宜求劃一　查災民來自鄂贛皖省及蘇之高寳各縣、到滬有先後之别、給養亦因時而異、有時發給現錢·有時發給生米·或麵包·餅乾·饝饝·等物、或每日一發、或數日一發、或一日數次、或僅發一部、未及全體、辦法殊不一律、各災民每遇團體代表、或報館記者、到所探詢、輙訴述困苦受飢、待遇不平之語、聽者不察、最易引起誤會、此後最好計口授糧、日給兩餐、毋使傷枯、各慈善團體、如有振施、亦應由社會局統一收發、以免紛岐、</p>
<p>登記務期確實　查災民人數衆多、無論門户内外、隨處散居、平時隨便行走、未可禁止出入、繞室查點、不易得其確數、即詢之辦事職員、亦都約略之詞、災民中有狡黠者、或所求未遂、遇有團體代表、或慈善家到所探詢狀况、每攻擊辦事職員、浮報名額、假公肥已、設或以訛傳訛、騰佈報章、於救災前途、影響匪輕、此後最好規定幾人、合居一室、毋使散居户外、臥室依次編號、並將每號住居災民姓名、粘貼窗外、俾知某號若干、依次計算、總數自得、災民無隙可乘、謠言自息、</p>
<p>管理力求嚴密　按災民來自他鄕、人數旣多、良莠不齊、在所難免每遇慈善團振濟食品、送所分給、輙麕集一隅、紛爭讓奪、呌囂喧呶、至難言狀、强者攘臂爭先、再得再索、弱者力擠不勝、望物興嗟、坐是飽者愈飽、飢者益飢殊失平均之旨·自應加以改良、嗣後如遇送到振品、慨歸社會局辦事職員、派定數量、與駐所巡警、督同夫役、依照臥室次序、挨號點名分發、俾免攘奪不平之弊、</p>
<p>注意公共衛生　查災民來自鄕間、農工居多、知識淺薄、每有孩童、於屋角庭前、任意便溺、一經雨淋日曝、穢氣四溢、妨害衛生、莫此爲甚、自宜指令地點、使之遵守、設遇懶步不前、應由駐所巡警、隨時干涉、此外衣物、應令時加洗滌、室内外塵垢、隨時掃除、尤其餘事、</p>
<p>設法供給茶水　查斜土路一帶、臨時收容所附近、旣無老虎灶供綸熟水、收容所内亦未預備時、有以生水止渴者、災後孑遺、最易致病、現經移往閘北對於飲料、似宜設法預備鉅量熟水、藉供止渴之需、</p>
<p>以上五點、不過就其淺近易爲、倘能見之實施、則災民受惠無窮、惟災巨欵絀、來日方長、關於收容經費、亦應由急振會、按日撥付、或由政府指定專欵、似較妥善</p>
<h3>各省災振昨訊</h3>
<p>國府救災會消息</p>
<p>朱慶瀾意見　國府救濟水災委員會常務委員朱慶瀾氏、對於撥放振欵事、昨日特發表意見云、所有收到各界慨助之賑欵、須完全放到災民身上、所有一切用費、以及與放振有關之任何事項所需用之欵項、余意以爲均須由政府負担之、前次本人曾向宋委員長提及此事、宋亦極表贊同、因之所有撥放各災區之欵項、均宜本此做去云云、</p>

<h3>某先生訊</h3>
<p>我從前在舊制中學將要畢業的當兒、因爲經濟壓迫、中途輟學、近幾年奔走四方、厠身政界、一其實不過混在表而當一個極小的職員、看了、那些老爺們的尊嚴些面孔松香架子、實在敎人難堪、說句意氣用事的話、須得馬上捲行李走路才好、但是爲了吃飯問題、不得不按住性子、仰面向人、我想照這樣下去、物質上固然得不到什麽好處、精神上却感覺非常痛苦、先生們、說也慚愧、我是除了拿筆桿别無他技、改業罷、自顧那一樁事、是我可以做得、因此每天把來放在心上、顧來倒去、委决不下、最後以我片而的兄解、想出一法、意欲凑幾個錢、揀城市附近、買幾畝園地、結幾間草屋、種些蔬菜菓木和養鷄鴨之類、過那農人的生活、到是不求於人、辛苦呢、我可以吃得來的、只是對於園藝、是個道地門外漢、若向圃人請敎、他們全憑經騐、不可以言傳的、似非有長期的實習不可、我現在的職務、不能一刻離開、倘把他辭掉、去練習種植、那就一家人都要挨餓、這層是萬不可能的、不知可有其他學習的捷徑没有、我感覺世上的事體、除了這樣自食其力之外、都不是我可以做得的、這種理想、究竟能行不能行、統求指敎、</p>
<p>（覆）先生、你的來信、我們十二分的欽佩、除了自食其力以外、誰還有該過的生活呢、你因爲還能吃得來苦、想到自立、想到園藝、吾們十二分贊成、希望你下一個决心、照這計劃做去、第一步不妨先調查園藝的書籍、丨先調查書目、後選購、次訪問專家、希望你不要輕視圃人、他們的經騐、就是吾們最寳貴的師資、同時即須開始實地試辦、不過最好、且慢離去現在職務、萬一因初度試辦而失敗、生計上更不了、這一點你要鄭重、可惜吾們没有知道你詳細、可貢獻的止此、乞原諒、</p>
<h3>歆孫君訊</h3>
<p>我是一個三十歲的青年、執業在上海相近的小銀行裏、在家庭中也擔負了經濟的壓迫、但是吾的志趣、却不很近於商情、尤其是銀錢業、勉强爲生活所驅、敷衍了十年、竟患了劇烈的神經衰弱症、醫生也說我有更換職業的必要、先生、論吾的慾望和病症、惟有脫離現職、但經濟問題如何解决呢、我所歡喜的是近於文學或專門一派的職業、有隨時進步和研究的可能、如記者書記書局或圖書館的職員等、但是何可必得呢、明知先生也只可從問題上賜予商榷領導、决不能普遍的作實際上之援助、但望你替我登出此篇文字、俾人知道職業須和自已的天才相近、不可勉强、一面或者希望有表同情於我而加以實際的援助呀、</p>
<p>（覆）職業須和自已天才相近、這是選業的原則、不過你現在已有職業、不妨另在業餘修習你所喜歡的學業、（照你說是文學一類、）這也是使有業者　業的一種特殊方式、因爲有一種天才相近的事情、不可作爲職業的、這樣纔可以雙方兼顧、若輕易脫離現職、不大妥當、</p>
<h3>王伯明君訊</h3>
<p>伯明今年才二十三耳、而執敎鞭整整已七易寒暑矣、中間歷盡艱難、備嘗酸辛、風雲變幻、一言難盡、初逄失學之苦、繼遭病魔之累、今受生活之壓迫、心力俱瘁、何以爲生、竊念當初年少志强、未嘗不思振作有爲、盡國民一分子之責、謀社會一線之幸福、乃年甫九齡、慈父見背、家無儋石、爲學不終、賴母氏賢、典簪買書、然而無父之兒、伶仃孤苦、學校重地、無錢莫人、小學恰才畢業、中學嚴如鴻溝、雖有青雲之志、亦終淪於失學、每覩他人之携筐負笈、奔波滬蘇、趾高氣揚、未嘗不掩面飲泣、而嘆命運之不若也、嗟乎、使我而多金、則中學而大學、更游學歐美各國、吸新空氣、研新科學、視彼碩士博士醫師工程師高等敎授、大學校長、不亦易如反掌乎、又何致潦倒世途、衣食不週耶、嗚呼、而今已矣、明旣失學、幸得父執之助、薦入某小學爲助敎、歲得六七十金、非敢去供奉甘旨、亦聊以補衣食之不足耳、當是時、自愧膚學、昕夕吟唔、其勤苦什百倍於學生者、於是身體起重大變化、瘦骨支離臂不盈握矣、今雖復原、壯健如常、然終困於資格、年年壓線、而時局不靖、經濟窘迫、敎費累欠、懸至十期以外、生計維艱、活命爲難、老母年邁、弱妻幼妹、雖不曰啼飢號寒、然亦衣敝食糲、差足近矣、我小學敎員之命運乎、何轗軻之甚也、若不另謀别法、尙能維持家庭生活於此亂世乎、西江之鮒、釜中之魂、前途豈堪設想乎、爲是懇請先生援手、或寵錫箴言、俾作南針、幸甚幸甚、并希在報端答復、則我小學界同人尤所感戴、豈僅失學之人涕零而謝已哉、</p>
<p>（覆）生活困難、萬方一槪、君但覺碩士博士敎授等等位尊金多、就吾們所知、他們感覺物質上的壓迫、和精神上的痛苦、也着實不少、還有掛了大頭銜而失業的、更着實不少、頭銜愈大、愈無辦法、第一勸你不要羡慕他們、你有兩優點（一）照你說支離瘦骨、今已壯健如常、這是何等可喜的事、（二）你還幸而有職業、雖歲入微薄、究竟聊勝於無、你該在業餘努力求知能上之補充、果能一步一步知能增進、則優越的機會、一天多一天、愈感生活困難、愈努力求知能增進、中外大敎育家、從小學敎員出身的、不知多少、幸勿灰心、改業不是正當而且不是穩當的辦法、望三思、</p>

<h3>八歲男孩死得苦縛石沉入浦底</h3>
<p>非普通之綁票案</p>
<p>是一幕謀財害命</p>
<p>朱松林無可抵賴</p>
<p>姚諸生仍圖推諉</p>
<p>庽居重慶路馬安里一百九十九號門牌寡婦姚顧氏之八歲男孩菊生、於本年七月七號下午三時、在安南路泰威坊九十六號外祖母顧趙氏家門首游玩、突被匪類拐匿無踪、嗣因勒贖洋二萬元未遂、致遭撕票、將菊生抛棄黄浦江中、葬身魚腹、業經靜安寺捕房華探目金春吾等緝獲是案正犯浦東人朱松林（即許妙根）·嫌疑犯蘇州婦人陸王氏·敎唆犯本地人姚諸生（即子生係被害人之族長）·等三人、解送第一特區地方法院訊供各情、已兩誌本報、茲悉此案按照審訊情形而論、并非一普通之綁票案、實係一圖奪家産之謀財害命案也、</p>
<p>菊生被害眞相　自上次庭訊改期後、中西探員爲明瞭眞相起見、一再向獲犯朱松林嚴詰、朱始供明姚菊生實遭彼謀斃、蓋朱自與姚諸生途遇後、姚即託朱設法中傷姚顧氏、朱乃將菊生誘出、先至戈登路愛文義路口大華汽車公司雇得汽車一輛、駛至匯山碼頭、棄車登一舢板、擺渡至浦東三林塘、意欲暫寄、厥後朱深恐被當地公安局發覺、又恐姚菊生吐露眞情、故又欲將菊生挈回上海、斯時朱突起謀殺之心、遂覓得大石一方、麻繩一根、復雇舢板、駛抵浦心、即將大石繫於繩之一端、另一端則縛於菊生身上、推入江中、致沉入浦底、尸身無從撈獲、當時朱從身畔取出洋一元、交給船夫、囑勿聲張、一面預將菊生足穿之鞋子一雙脫下、以作將來贖欵時之憑據、乃獨自回滬、嗣因贖欵無着、乃將鞋子抛棄於重慶路二五七號門外之夾弄中、中西探得供、乃督同朱松林同往、將鞋子一雙尋獲、</p>
<p>捕房律師陳述　昨日下午、已届此案續審之期、二時許、姚家之男女親屬隣居、均陸續至特院刑二庭旁聽約數百人、致庭爲之滿、擁擠不堪、姚菊生之生母姚顧氏、則默坐於旁聽席、眉鎖春山、哭泣不止、二時半、由承審推事吴廷琪君升座、先訊一侵占案、迨訊及此案、已四時許矣、被告姚諸生延陶悟志·余華龍·兩律師、陸王氏延王亮卿律師到庭代辯、祗朱松林并無律師代理、首由捕房律師王耀堂起而陳述此案經過情形頗詳、謂自姚菊生被拐後、其家屬即登報招尋、初懸賞格一百元、後增至五百元、前後共接到匪黨勒贖信函、有十五封之多、姚顧氏曾付過匪黨費用二十元、但對於第二被告陸王氏因據朱松林供明與此案無關、實係藉端誣攀故請先行判决、以免覊押無辜、今有證人到案請訊、遂將信函鞋子等呈察、</p>
<p>浦東人之口音　繼據大華氣車公司汽車夫顧全生供稱、七月七日下午二時餘、被告朱松林偕一婦人、挈領年約七八歲之男孩到來雇車、由我開駛一七五五五號汽車、先言明至外灘車資一元、後忽欲至匯山碼頭、車至提籃橋、朱等即下車、給我車資一元半、酒資半元、當時由朱在簽字紙上親書一元五角、遂將該簽字紙呈案、但所謂婦人者、并非被告陸王氏云云、又據顧培亨投稱、在蔣畸士律師處爲帮辦、姚顧氏係我胞妹、自外甥菊生被拐後、先接信函兩封、勒贖洋二萬元、後忽接匪黨電話、由我接聽、問我信收到否、現在如何辦法、我答其信已收到、當照來信實行、惟察其口音、極似前房客朱松林、因我住居安南路泰威坊九十六號、朱於本年三月間、曾來租借餘屋、住居月餘、始行他遷、彼爲浦東人、故其口音、極易辨别等語、</p>
<p>朱松林之供詞　又據婦人許張氏投稱、朱松林係我丈夫、彼尙有一妾、名周菊仙、自朱納妾時、即與我意見不合、另行分居、對於姚菊生被夫害死、我亦曾聞菊仙及朱松林談過、惟如何謀死、我不知悉查朱松林本名許妙根、因過寄朱姓、因而易名等語、詰之朱松林供稱、民國十六年間、我在漢口與友人張紹榮因烟土糾葛、被張及陸王氏之夫陸仁生呑没洋一千元、故在夏口法院涉訟、我被押三年、嗣即釋出來滬、此案與陸王氏實無關係、係因其夫呑没我欵、故而陷害、對於姚諸生、則前在漢口相識、其時姚開設小有天酒館、與我并無仇隙、本年二月二十九日、我從浦東來滬、在寳裕里口與姚相値、因見我衣衫襤褸、即給我洋兩元、并約在一樂天茶樓會唔、遂託我設法勾引姚顧氏當給我洋一百二十元、嗣我因見姚氏性情端莊、天良發現、不忍相害、詎姚諸生一再相商、謂勾引旣成泡影、不若誘去其子、我乃從之、將菊生誘出、當晚因無法與姚會面、故將菊生挈往浦東、失足墮浦、我實無用大石繩索繫於菊生身上謀害之事、我共得姚諸生洋二百二十元云云、</p>
<p>本案改期再訊　其餘之供詞、因與上次相同、已見報端、故從略、吴推事核供、當將信函十五封擲下交朱閱看、詢其内有幾封係汝所寫、朱審視良久、當檢出三封非彼所寫、其餘十封、直認係彼所書不諱、尙有兩封、則係在漢口託測字攤代筆云云、陸王氏否認所控、姚諸生仍供係被朱誣攀、吴推事以時已薄暮、諭本案改期十月一號下午再訊、陸王氏交保、朱·姚·還押、</p>

<h3>娟的憂愁</h3>
<p>— 征鴻</p>
<p>娟的憂愁、是一天天地在增加着、她是失了她的父母了、她是失了她的家鄕了、她的家鄕是江北、現在早遭了洪水的蹂躙、她的家除了父母外、只有二個弟弟、都住在江北、他們有一些田地、很可以過得去、這次她一得着家鄕水災的消息、是非常的驚慌、然而驚慌之中、却帶着一種莫名的欣喜、她想不管怎樣損失、她的父母們、總該是無恙的、也許就要安然到上海來、而她可以和他們圍聚在一處了、她等着等着、後來、她漸漸地失望了、非但她父母的踪跡、就是她父母的消息、她也無從知道、没有一個熟人她可以打聽、没有一張報紙、她可以得着些頭緒、本來很鎭定的她、竟至失措了、終日慌慌張張、心神不定、但是這有什麽用呢、她的父母、仍是杳然、</p>
<p>每天第一班信到時、她總是興奮的、搶先出去看、有没有給她的信、等到别的同學、興怱怱拿着信回來後、她才空手慢慢地踱回來、頽傷而疲倦、好像經了長途奔跑一般、她顯得很痛苦、但她竭力自制着、勉强說、「今天家裏還没有信來、一定是完了、」同時照例有一個同學說、「你不要着急吧、想必他們早到了什麽安全的地方了、在亂糟糟的時候、個人往往一切都忘了去做、他們想不到寫信給你、也是意中事呀、」這一類話、她也相信地聽着、暫時當做一種無聊的安慰、然而這到底何嘗安慰了她、天下最苦的、是在恍惚不定的境地中、</p>
<p>她的焦急暴躁、漸漸地消失了、她變得沈靜了、而且是從來没有的沈靜、往往在上課時、她出神地坐着、兩眼微微地閉着、看上去、她是在想着她的父母了、她是想着她的家鄕了、我們可以想像得到、她想着家鄕、水怎樣流得滿處都是、水怎樣淹没了成熟的田、水怎樣衝去一切、這一切是她愛着的是她熟悉的、她也時時、側側頭、傾聽着、似乎聽見了水聲、最後她見着此父母們的慘狀了、他們怎樣連爬帶跌地攀上屋頂、他們怎樣對着白茫茫的水號哭而一些没有援救、終於、飢餓與恐怖怎樣逼迫着他們、有的疲極眩暈了、跌下水去、其餘的也慘呌一聲、一躍而下、一同去了、……她無聲無息地、閉着的眼、流出淚來、她也不知道、直等敎師偶然一聲提高的講到、把她驚醒、她才迅速地揩乾眼睛、迅速地揩去面前書上的淚點、她是暗暗地毁傷了、但這有什麽用呢、她的父母依舊是杳然、</p>
<p>去年秋天、他來看他的女兒、他是一個過了中年的鄕下人、微秃的頭頂、縐紋的額、誠懇的微笑、一撮短小的鬍子、他的一舉一動、都表示着單誠與樸素、雖是穿了一件綢衣、但這件綢衣、是不大相宜於那個時令的、而且他也頭出不大穿慣的樣子、顯然的、他很珍視這件綢衣、特地穿了來、不要穿了樸素的布衣來、使他女兒失了面子、他客氣地坐在會客室裏、看着他女兒、瑣屑地說着話、最後他談到他掌來的一袋生珍珠米、說、「這是你愛吃的、這些珍珠米、可以在洋磁風爐上、放在小鍋子裏煑、一共大約有五鍋的樣子、你要湯多些、分做六次煑也罷、……這些你可以分給同學們吃、她們符你還好嗎、」說着、又愼重地拿出一包糖來、「這裏是糖、煑起來不要放得太多、太甜了也不好吃……留心着不要燒焦、」這包糖不是他從鄕間帶出來的、他是特地到上海後買的、後來我們看見、是一包上好的細白糖、他要護他的女兒吃得考究些、後來他要去了、走出會客室、剛剛一陣微風吹着她女兒的衣服、他不知不覺地、在她胳膊上、揑了一把、說「衣服必得穿得暖些、袖子幹嗎這麽短、須得長一些才好、」不料他這不知不覺的一揑、引得一個匿在外邊偷着的同學、忍不住哧噗笑了、他立時覺察、誠懇的臉上、頓時紅了起來、他覺得很難爲情、他覺得做了粗野的舉動、這是田裏的農人才做的、他謹愼地看看他的女兒、要不要她聽了一笑受窘了、看見他女兒坦然欣然、滿不在乎的樣子、他才放心地去了、這深摯的愛、我們都爲他深深地感動、何况是他的女兒、</p>
<p>我們覺得惶惑了、以這樣的慈親、即使在困難混亂中、也何以竟會不給女兒一些消息呢、然而他到底在什麽地方呢、</p>
<h3>幽默</h3>
<p>— 晏娜</p>
<p>懷着滿腔求智的熱望、從華南濱海的甲埠、䟦涉重洋、來海上、入了日暉港邊的西校、我酷愛自然、海天的朝陽落日、浪花飛霞、與乎波上浮鷗、月夜孤廌、都是欣賞的對象、我恨不得永遠擁在　懷裏、永遠不要離開牠、我忝列西校的「桃李」之後、第一慰快的事、便是西校的自然環境、因爲牠雖比不上甲埠、却另有一番不同的風味、校舍跟前有碧油油一片青草、稍遠有一灣流水、紅紫的野花、點綴着草原、苑裏稀疏的柳林、不斷地傳出嬌娜的鳥聲、春風拂面、令人陶然欲醉、心想但願西校的敎育、也和自然環境一樣的滿意、那就合了古話所謂「春風風人」了、</p>
<p>校長是甲埠的老名士、四十來歲、碩長的身軀、儒雅的風度、自然頗具各士「風格」、善平仄詩、嗜酒、向不很到校理事、紀念週因爲欲作政治報告、更是忌之如疾、名士的特性如此、</p>
<p>名士聘的許多敎職員、大都各有專長、有的善於應付、有的善於恭維、</p>
<p>課餘議論敎職員、是學生的通性、我們同學的感情、素來融洽、談起話來、古今上下、無所拘束、五月某日、天氣清朗、適當星期六、下午課畢、邀了許多同學、到校前一個山上丨丨上海無高原、明明一個土阜、硬呌牠作山丨丨揀了一塊細軟的青草坐下、看江上帆檣、往來如織、水天相接處、一陣水鳥、散而復聚地在斜暉中遨翔、微風拂過草上、吹起一陣浪潮似的皺紋、何處隱約的鐘聲、擊破靜空的沈寂、大家默坐了一會、好運動的某君從草叢裏拾得一塊白石頭、跳了起來、很勁地望着西校擲去、口裏嚷着、「我要一石打碎那所製造「造糞機」的工廠」、石鏘然落在山腰一塊大石上、大家知道他在靜默中、想起了西校、想到牠那混亂無生氣的辦學方法、更聯想到牠那神龍見首不見尾似的名士校長、各自心中都燃燒着熱烈的憤火、</p>
<p>遊伴中的子君、素以「幽默」見稱、紫檀色的臉上、配上一對銅釘似的亮晶、的大眼、即令默默不語時、也帶有幾分滑稽神氣、他把頭兒低埀、幾乎挿在兩膝中間、很久很久、他似乎興奮了、把頭抬起、雙唇呶了一呶、又停了一會兒、復把下唇咬在上齒下面、一手支頣、裝出一個女性的媚笑、大家知道他的故事又來了、</p>
<p>「主任先生、你知道秦朝在前、還是漢朝在前、子裝出嬌滴滴十足女性的尖俏聲、眼兒還流星似地斜睨着一個遊伴、</p>
<p>大家深信他學人的本領、幾乎前無古人、後有來者、從他語音神態中、推知是在學史地敎員璧女士、璧女士敎書吃力、是「知師莫若弟」的學生所深知的、但是她爲什麽會問出這樣無常識的問題呢、大家不免懷疑起子君的故意刻薄了、</p>
<p>子君望望大家的神氣、遲疑了一會兒、接着又嬌娜凄媚地立了起了、站在我們跟前、頸脖扭曲地望着大家、一個手擺在背後、舌尖兒舐着上唇、說道、「你們問的字、等我下去查查字典再來告訴你們罷、遊伴中凡受過璧女士的課的、都同聲呌絶、别班的人也跟着笑了、</p>
<p>在大家歡笑聲中、子君的神態又變了、他臉上堆起一層陰險浮滑的假笑、裝出似幹昻而實軟弱的神氣立了一會、</p>
<p>大家出神地看子君的表演、不由得同聲呌好、子君把手一揮、頻頻點首、換上了一副敎務主任丁先生的神氣說、「再會、我南京有事、兩個月後、可來此住幾天、考察考察、」子君在喧笑中停了他的表演、獨自去尋小石子玩去了、</p>
<p>許多游伴、有的氣憤塡胸、有的笑不可遏、同班Ｔ女士、與我併坐半天不作聲、到現在方陰陽怪氣地說、「佢們如此騙我們、眞不知於心何忍、」子君挿一句、「忍其忍、非吾之所謂忍、」大家又笑了、</p>
<p>暮色滄溟、飛鳥早已歸林去了、西校屋角、隱約露在叢林之表、民間炊烟、隨風飄散、織成一幅仲夏特有的晚景、我此時才痛感到、西校外景十分幽美、但是不免「金玉其外」了、</p>

<p>江灣某大學可算是滬上各私立大學的先進者、因爲具有悠久的歷史、辦理的成績也還不差、所以近幾年來進去攻讀的學生年有增加、以致校内的宿舍不敷容納、但是學校爲維持學校生命起見、又不得不多收學生、以增加收入、所有校内住不下的學生、祗好在校外設法了、於是就有一般善於投機的投資家和商人、在學校附近建築了許多房子租給學生住、他們的眼光眞不差、生意眞興隆、據說每學校也和校裏的宿舍一樣有人滿之患、所以校舍附近屋字林立、除了宿舍以外、還有飯館、各色各樣的公司、商店、小販、以及川流不息的各種車輛、熙熙攘攘、儼然成一大學市場、而這市塲上的共同目的、無非是在剝削學生、</p>
<p>需要愈多供給也當愈多、這是經濟學上的一條簡單定律、這租房子的生意經給校裏的某一個同學看中了、未免引起他的利慾觀念、認爲這個生意經實在是發財的好途徑、於是就在暑期内擇定學校後門旁邊的空地、建築了一座三層樓的洋房宿舍、房間比較校裏的寬大些、可是收的費却貴得多了、校裏宿舍至多的每學期祗收二十元、這裏要收二十五元、而設備方面並不見得比校裏的宿舍好、這就可窺見其剝削心重了、果然、這位同學的發財運動、在開學時房間已給人定滿了、我是本學期考進的新生、聽說校内宿舍已没有空位了、在開學前就在這裏完了一個舖位、也做了這位同學的顧主之一、</p>
<p>我住進這宿舍兩天後、聽到這房子的租金不是一律的、朝南的房間是二十五元、朝北的房間是二十四元、朝北而靠近厠所的房間是二十三元、我知道了這個辦法以後、實在不能不佩服這位同學對於生意經研究得精明、因爲這樣一來、無論好壞的房痱都會得有人住、營業方面可不因房間地位的好壞而受影響、這種巧妙的辦法在善於榨取的學校當局和善於謀利的投資家商人還没有想到去實行、這位同學却想到了、這實在是善於榨取的學校當局和善於謀利的投資家商人所不知的、以前專於剝削學生的　投資家、商人、小販、以及茶房和車夫、現在却臨到學生來剝削學生了、這恐怕就是大學敎育的進步現象、</p>
<p>宿費是一住進來就完全收去了、可是寢室裏的電燈暗淡不明、和各處的自來水都没有流動、厠所的惡濁不堪、使住在裏面的人感覺許多不安、而這信房主同學並　去顧到、這種祇知利已而不知利人的表現、使我禁不住要喊出幾聲、「剝削、剝削、」（移酬助賑）</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Post-Disaster Measures for the Flood</h3>
<p>The most crucial aspect of the post-disaster measures for this flood is providing immediate relief. It is not about grand discussions of overall plans, but about effectively implementing the treatment of projects that are already at risk or have collapsed. If we engage in grand discussions of overall plans, involving the entire Jianghuai River and the sea, and comprehensive coordination, it will inevitably take a long time, resulting in empty talk without practical results. Furthermore, it is not about merely arguing about how to punish those responsible, but about pursuing the reasons why water conservancy has been neglected in the past and what led to this major disaster. It is about combining the efforts of officials and the people to quickly remedy the situation. If we merely pursue the deserved punishment of those responsible, even if we kill them and eat their flesh, it will not be enough to compensate for the losses of tens of millions of people, and it will instead lead to conflicting opinions, which will add obstacles to the work of providing relief. Today is a time for united efforts to provide emergency relief, not a time to sing high-sounding tunes or argue about feelings.</p>
<p>Today, the Grand Canal seems to be in a state of helplessness. If we continue to assign responsibility to people with no experience, the future will be fraught with danger. Therefore, the first priority should be to choose experienced people to take charge of the matter. Recently, I saw the words of Mao Yisheng in the newspaper, saying, "This time, even a seawall with three layers of complete stone construction was broken by the storm surge. Moreover, the lake water is vast, no less than the ocean. The dikes are low and the soil is loose, making them even more vulnerable." At first glance, his words seem reasonable, but upon closer examination, they are greatly mistaken. The nature of river water and seawater is different. Seawater is hard, so three layers of stone seawalls are not enough to withstand the attack of the storm surge. The water of the Grand Canal is soft, so only mud, soil, and grass are sufficient. If, as Mao said, we must use the method of preventing the sea to prevent the canal, and build the river dike with the same engineering as a seawall, wouldn't it be ridiculous? If we do not understand the nature of water, how can we take responsibility for water management? The reporter cites this example to prove that water management must be based on experience. Secondly, it is about the organization of water management agencies. In the Qing Dynasty, responsibility was specialized, with dedicated funds and dedicated materials. Repairs were carried out every year, so even when faced with danger, there was no lack of coordination. In recent years, the organization of agencies has been slightly changed. The scope is smaller, and there are more transfers, which makes the operation of the office less flexible. The funds for water management have been diverted to other uses, and there is no storage of materials. The annual repairs have also been abandoned. It is called water conservancy, but it is actually just an empty name. With such a lack of preparation, it is no wonder that they will be caught unprepared and wait for death when suddenly faced with the pressure of heavy storms and rain. Therefore, the future water management agencies should urgently consider ways to improve. Thirdly, the new and old projects cannot be rigidly adhered to. New projects are not necessarily all good, and old projects are not necessarily all bad. We should refer to both. Taking the seawall as an example, the new project uses cement and steel bars, which is certainly stronger than before, but the old method of sloping stone beach is better than the new method of vertical wall. The sloping type can reduce the water potential by erosion, while the water force can easily shake the vertical wall. This principle is even known to outsiders like us. The reporter cites this point to prove that the old method cannot be completely abandoned. In short, there are many problems related to water management in the future. We must choose the most urgent ones, study them openly, and work together to solve the current emergency relief methods, and then gradually move on to the fundamental reorganization. We cannot stick to our established opinions, nor can we perfunctorily shirk responsibility, and all empty talk and meaningless disputes must be eliminated. This is probably close to the truth.</p>

<h3>Foreign Important Telegrams</h3>
<h3>Gandhi Reiterates Independence Demands to Labour Party MPs</h3>
<p>Attends Private Gathering Barefoot Wrapped in Homespun Cloth</p>
<p>Pleads for Millions of Helpless Indians</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 16th - Tonight, Gandhi addressed Labour Party MPs in the House of Commons. Almost all Labour MPs attended, and many former Labour Cabinet ministers were also present. Gandhi spoke freely of his purpose and reiterated his representation of millions of mute and half-starved Indians, demanding independence for India. After speaking, he answered questions from Labour MPs for twenty minutes, almost all of which were about industrial conditions and India's rejection of British cloth. In his answers, Gandhi said that the current economic and administrative system is sucking the last drop of blood from the villagers of India, and he is pleading for these people. Gandhi was still wrapped in homespun cloth and a homemade blanket. Accompanying him were his son and Ms. Slade. Ms. Slade is the daughter of the late British Admiral Slade, but she greatly admires Gandhi, wears sandals without socks, and wears white Indian clothes, which is in stark contrast to Ms. Wilkinson, a fashionable Labour MP. Gandhi, thin and tall, with bare legs, moving among politicians and entering and exiting oak-paneled corridors, was truly an unprecedented sight in the House of Commons. Conservative and Liberal parties also wanted to see his style and listen to his words, so they mistakenly regarded the Labour Party's private gathering as a public gathering of members of parliament and were eventually driven out of the venue by the Labour Party. Tomorrow night, Gandhi will speak to MPs from the three parties.</p>
<h3>British Navy Soldiers Revolt Against Pay Cuts</h3>
<p>Government Promises to Investigate the Situation</p>
<p>In Order to Alleviate the Suffering of Sailors</p>
<p>Atlantic Fleet Ordered to Return to its Original Defense</p>
<p>House of Commons Passes Tax Increase on Alcohol and Tobacco</p>
<p>Report by the Secretary of the Navy in the House of Commons - Secretary of the Navy, Austen Chamberlain, stated in the House of Commons that the Navy Department had ordered all ships of the Atlantic Fleet to return to their original ports and ordered the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy to investigate the various hardships reported, together with representatives of the Navy Department. The government has approved the Navy Department's proposal to alleviate the hardships. This announcement aroused cheers from Labour MPs in the House of Commons, lasting for a long time. Various parties questioned the Secretary of the Navy, and Prime Minister MacDonald was also drawn into the discussion. The Secretary of the Navy did not acknowledge the Labour Party's claim that sailors were unable to fully state their feelings. When the Secretary of the Navy spoke of the possibility of reducing the hardships of monthly pay cuts, he said that any corrective measures deemed necessary did not need to be approved by Congress. Former Secretary of the Navy, Alexander, asked the Prime Minister whether any corrections could be applied to the measures for reducing salaries in various departments. The Prime Minister replied that, under the procedures permitted by the national salary reduction plan, the general rules for handling salary reductions were for each department to consider and correct on its own. The opposition requested a recess to discuss the suspension of the Atlantic Fleet's autumn exercises, but the Speaker did not agree. The Labour Party also attempted to prolong the discussion, but was also stopped by the Speaker.</p>
<p>Navy Department Issues Long Announcement - The Navy Department issued a long article, stating that the sailors of Invergordon claimed that the navy's pay cuts had been reduced by as much as 50%, which was not true. The navy's salary reductions at all levels were only 13%, 10%, and 7%. The army and air force are also currently reducing salaries in the same way. All those who enlisted since October 1925, whether in the navy, army, or air force, are subject to this reduction. Moreover, the number of those subject to this salary reduction plan in the army and air force is even greater. The Navy Department is now aware that some sailors have married before reaching the age to receive the married allowance, and therefore have to support their married lives with the pay of unmarried sailors, and are indeed greatly affected by the salary reduction. The Navy Department has ordered an immediate investigation into this situation. Before publishing this article, the Navy had a meeting for four hours. The claim made yesterday by the sailors of Invergordon that the family allowance had been reduced by 50% was due to a misunderstanding. The Navy Department told a Reuters reporter that there had been no direct modification of the salary reduction plan, but only a need for slight adjustments.</p>
<p>Warships Sail Out of Invergordon - After the Navy Department issued a statement saying that it would promptly consider the hardships of the sailors, the sailors' passive resistance to orders immediately disappeared. All warships sailed out of Invergordon tonight and returned to their original ports. Before sailing, the captain clearly stated that they were returning to their original ports and not going far.</p>
<p>Lower-Ranking Sailors Petition the Navy Department - London, 17th - Sailors petitioned the Navy Department, claiming to be loyal subjects of the King and requesting that the reduction of the minimum military pay be revised. They said that unless they receive written guarantees from the Navy Department and Congress regarding the revision of the salary reduction, the sailors will remain united and refuse to serve under the new pay scheme. Sailors are willing to accept any reasonable reductions.</p>
<p>Tranquility of the British Navy in Hong Kong - Hong Kong, 17th - This morning, Reuters received a report from the authorities as follows: there is no sign of unrest among the sailors here. It seems that they are all aware of the seriousness of the situation in their country and know that the salary reduction is unavoidable.</p>
<p>Dissatisfaction of the Army and Police - London, 17th - The Cabinet held a special meeting in the House of Commons last night to discuss the events in Invergordon and elsewhere. According to the Daily Express, the army and police have expressed dissatisfaction with the set salary reduction plan. The Cabinet meeting last night also considered this. (Above, Reuters)</p>

<h3>Chinese and Japanese Representatives Engage in Fierce Verbal Battle at the League of Nations</h3>
<p>Fukazawa Loudly Advocates Protecting Vested Interests in Manchuria and Mongolia</p>
<p>Wu and Shi, Two Representatives, List Rebuttals</p>
<p>Briand Leaves Geneva to Prepare for Visit to Germany</p>
<p>Geneva News - Since the opening of the League of Nations General Assembly on the 10th, our representatives and Japanese representatives have repeatedly engaged in verbal battles over the Manchurian issue, arousing great attention internationally. At the meeting on the 13th, both Chinese and Japanese representatives made very long speeches. Japanese representative and former ambassador to China, Fukazawa, loudly advocated for the so-called "vested interests in Manchuria and Mongolia." The main points of his speech were approximately three: (1) Vested interests in Manchuria and Mongolia have treaties and other reasonable bases. Japan has more than 20 years of hard work in developing the industry and economy of Manchuria and Mongolia. Japan's retention of its vested interests is of great benefit to both China and Japan. (2) Japan's support for vested rights in Manchuria and Mongolia and its actions regarding the retention of vested rights do not conflict with the Anti-War Pact. Chinese representatives, adhering to the anti-Japanese spirit of the National Government, oppose all Japanese actions, but Japan's policy towards Manchuria and Mongolia does not pose any threat to peace in the Far East. (3) The Wanbaoshan Incident was the result of the historical oppression of Koreans by the Chinese authorities. As for the Nakamura Incident, it was a manifestation of the anti-foreign and anti-Japanese mentality of the Chinese army. On this point, Fukazawa cited the case of the English teenager Taopeng as an example. Fukazawa's speech repeatedly accused us of being "anti-foreign," hoping that we would lose the sympathy of other countries. Our representatives Wu Kaisheng and Shi Zhaoji refuted Fukazawa's arguments one by one, listing rebuttals, leaving the Japanese representative speechless. Representatives from various countries were quite clear about the Japanese invasion policy towards our Northeast regarding the Nakamura Incident and the Wanbaoshan Incident, and expressed sympathy for our representatives' speeches.

<p>Geneva, 16th - The work of the League of Nations Council has been temporarily transferred to the committees. The Political Committee met today to review the results of the meetings of the European Union Committee. Without much discussion, it passed a resolution to transfer the resolution to the League of Nations Council. It slightly criticized the European Union Committee, first praised the work of the European Union Committee, and expressed the League of Nations Council's satisfaction with its achievements. Then, it suggested that the European Union Committee should focus on dealing with issues within the European scope, and that more general issues should be handled by the League of Nations Council. The resolution further suggested that the European Union Committee should reduce the number of shareholders and make greater use of the League of Nations agencies and its secretariat to avoid duplication. The Finance Committee discussed the issue of assisting Austria in resolving its financial difficulties, advocating that the League of Nations lend 150 million francs to the Saar region, which is currently under French trusteeship by the League of Nations, pending a public vote in 1935 to decide whether the region should be merged with France or Germany. When the Political Committee met today, the most notable issue was the issue of minorities. German Foreign Minister Curtis delivered a powerful speech, strongly advocating for fairer treatment of minorities. Minister Curtis said that some countries had promised complete freedom of culture and religion to minorities within their countries, but still cannot fulfill their promises. Minister Curtis further said that former British Foreign Minister Henderson had acknowledged that the issue of minorities had international relations, and that the protection of minorities was an issue of international law. Finally, Curtis put forward concrete suggestions, advocating for providing minorities with the convenience of petitioning the League of Nations, because the current procedures are very complicated, and the grievances of minorities are often ignored. Representatives from various countries then spoke in succession, but French representative Briand left Geneva today before the end of the session. Before leaving, Briand had another meeting with German Foreign Minister Curtis. Briand's sudden return to Paris is said to be related to his visit to Germany with Prime Minister Laval.</p>
<h3>French-Italian Naval Talks Break Down Again</h3>
<p>Paris, 16th - The French-Italian naval talks, which recently resumed in Geneva, seem to have broken down again. However, according to a high-ranking official, virtually no talks have taken place since France sent a concrete proposal to the Italian government several weeks ago. Political circles do not believe this statement. It is said that although there have been no real talks between the two countries, the leaders of the two countries did discuss the French proposal in Geneva, and their opinions on the dispute over equal naval power are still not close. Therefore, the two countries decided not to hold formal talks for the time being, in order to avoid complications.</p>
<h3>Public Telegram</h3>
<p>Tianjin Telegram - For the public review of all newspapers, I have read the just and forceful telegrams of the Commander-in-Chief and Deputy Commander in Eastern Guangdong, with benevolent words and broad benefits. Reflecting on oneself and correcting mistakes is like reading Lu Zhexing's article, and like putting firewood under the pot, it truly conforms to Jia Yi's plan for peace and security. All those with blood and qi cannot help but weep. If one is not a stubborn fool, how can one not be moved? Our country is not well-made, and wars continue. Internal affairs are not managed well, and external troubles are triggered. Human affairs are not managed properly, and natural disasters are called upon. Black dragons are rampant, and red atmospheres are blazing. The fate of the country will not only be destroyed by the invasion of strong neighbors, but also by the rampaging of the common bandits. The people's lives have already died in the chaos of swords and spears, and have died again in the floods of the Yangtze and Huai Rivers. The country is exhausted, and the Divine Land is sinking. The melons of the Huangtai cannot bear to be picked again, and the eggs of the overturned nest cannot be completed. Only peace can save the disaster, and only unity can save the country. If we use the remnants of gullies to repeat the vast calamities of bees and smoke, the way of boats along the chestnut shallows will be blocked, and the source of benevolent soups and righteous chestnuts will be cut off. It is no different from working for strong neighbors and colluding with common bandits, thrusting knives into the dying disaster-stricken people, and cutting ropes on a thread of thousands of pounds of a dangerous country. It is absolutely inhumane and will eventually lead to complete destruction. Tracing back to the beginning of the division, it was nothing more than a difference in political views, followed by a dispute of emotions, which led to a stalemate. What regret is there for the country, and what guilt is there for our people? In the midst of the waves, the Wu and Yue are all responsible for the same boat. Facing foreign insults, the brothers abandon the quarrel within the walls. It is appropriate to be mindful of the beans being boiled by the stalks and to eliminate all boundaries to save those with disheveled hair. If we look at the disaster, one heart will be held in one mind, and loving the people is loving the country. The merits and demerits of a thousand years are a matter of a single thought. All comrades, descendants of the vast Yan and Huang, are concerned about the thoughts of the motherland. Knowing the world situation, how can they bear to see the country collapse? Therefore, I make nine urgent appeals, hoping to unite and appeal to promote peace and harmony and reverse the calamities, turning the atmosphere of war into the sun and moon and clearing the great rivers and mountains. The people will be spared from being fish, and the country will have hope. The party and the country are fortunate, and the nation is fortunate. Moreover, the disaster area is vast, and the flood is still deep. Frost is approaching, and violent winds are gradually increasing. Refugees are everywhere, and they are all people without clothing and food. Gentlemen, please be generous and extend the desire to be hungry and drowning, and also hope to widely solicit donations to save these refugees, to help them cross the sea of suffering and enter the city of transformation to be at peace. Pleading for the people, the telegram flies, Tianjin Mayor Zhang Xueming bows his head.</p>

<h3>Wuhan River Water Gradually Recedes</h3>
<p>The Water Conservancy Bureau Plans to Repair Breached Dikes</p>
<p>The Garrison Command Advances Curfew Hours</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: This year's flood is extraordinarily severe, with dikes in all of Hubei collapsing entirely, and the dikes themselves largely submerged. The autumn waters stretch endlessly, all a single color, making it impossible to distinguish between river and land. Now, as the waters gradually recede, traces of the submerged dikes are slowly becoming visible. The Water Conservancy Bureau is undertaking surveys and planning the repair of breaches in the dikes, and will raise substantial funds to heighten the dikes, as a permanent solution. The first step is to survey the Zhanggong Dike in Hankou, the Wufeng Dike in Wuchang, and the Wujin Dike. The second step is to survey the main dikes along the Xiang River. The third step is to survey the dikes along the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The first step is now complete and work has started on surveying the main dikes along both banks of the Xiang River. Once the survey is complete, repairs will begin. According to Bureau Director Chen Keming, it is estimated that it will cost three million yuan to fill the breaches in the dikes. If all the main dikes in the province are to be raised and thickened, the cost would be over forty million yuan. Given the financial exhaustion of Hubei Province, it is feared that only the breaches can be repaired; a fundamental solution will have to wait for the future.</p>
<p>Wuhan has been flooded for more than forty days. Due to the strict precautions taken by the garrison troops, order has been maintained. Now that the floodwaters are gradually receding, defense remains crucial. The Garrison Command has deployed a network of sentries around Wuhan and has ordered the full mobilization of the Water Police Bureau for patrols, with two large boats provided by the Command to assist in patrolling. The Xiang River has been temporarily blockaded and random checks are being carried out on the streets. Furthermore, a notice was issued today (the 16th) advancing the curfew to start on the 20th. Traffic will be cut off at 10:00 PM every night. Government employees traveling on official business will not be able to pass without a pass issued by the Command. The notice is recorded below: 1. Since the flooding of Wuhan, this Command has implemented a special curfew, from 10:00 PM each night to 5:00 AM the next morning, deploying sentries throughout the Wuhan garrison area and along the outer lines, cutting off traffic. However, government and military personnel wearing badges or emblems, or able to give the correct password, were granted permission to pass. Recently, as the city streets have become passable, the curfew has been tightened. At the 73rd Garrison Conference on September 2nd, the chairman raised the issue for discussion. Although there are many disaster victims and order is disrupted after the city is flooded, the inconvenience of transportation and difficulty of movement actually reduce concerns about the defense area. Therefore, cutting off traffic at night, not issuing passes, and only having special permission to pass, based on the symbols or badges of government and military units, or the ability to give the correct password, was sufficient to avoid negligence. As the waters recede, the situation will be more serious than during the flooding. In addition to all garrison-related tasks being tightened in comparison to the flooding, cutting off traffic at night without issuing passes will not be strict or effective. Military and police personnel will also find it difficult to cut off traffic. Should passes be issued for cutting off traffic at night after the waters recede? This is submitted for public decision. After unanimous resolution, the Command will issue passes according to the established rules of last year, in order to strictly maintain the garrison, and to cut off traffic from 11:00 PM each night, etc., as recorded. It was also recorded and submitted to the Land, Sea, and Air Force General Command for instruction Deputy Character No. 982, which stated: "Received the submission and approve the issuance of passes in accordance with the resolution to facilitate strict inspection and prevent wrongdoing. This order is for your information." Subsequently, Instruction No. 2315 was received, ordering that the time for cutting off traffic at night, as recorded in the conference report, should still be changed to start at 10:00 PM each night, etc. It is now decided that starting from September 20th, traffic will be cut off every night from 10:00 PM, and no one will be allowed to pass without holding a newly colored pass issued by this Command. All blue passes issued last year are no longer valid and are hereby canceled. All military unit personnel with complete badges who are out on official business must also wait to give the password and have their passes checked before being allowed to pass. As for the cars of government and military personnel, they must display clear badges or flags of their respective agencies in front of the car after traffic is cut off at night, and slow down and stop when approaching a sentry post, waiting for the sentry to inquire about the password, ask questions clearly, or check the pass before passing. In addition to separate letters, this notice is hereby issued for general information. (July 16th)</p>
<h3>Inspection Record of the Disaster Situation in Hubei Province (1)</h3>
<p>Reports from Relief Teams One and Two</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: In order to provide extensive relief in light of the vast disaster areas and the large number of disaster victims in various counties in Hubei, the Hubei Flood Relief Association, together with the Central Health Group's Hankou Office, the North China Famine Relief Association, the Northeast Four Provinces Charity Federation, the Universal Morality Society, the Chinese Jishi Society, and the China General Society of the World Red Cross Relief Team, and other organizations, have organized relief teams to set out in different directions. The first team, led by Yang Zigong, set out for Xindi. The second team, led by Du Yannian, set out for Fankou, as the disaster situation there is the most serious, and relief cannot be delayed. Both teams have now arrived at their destinations and are providing relief. They have already sent letters to the Relief Association, reporting on the disaster situation, detailing the suffering of the refugees. The information obtained from on-the-spot investigations is credible and reliable, and is introduced as follows:</p>
<p>Xindi: The first relief team, led by Yang Zigong, Chairman of the Northeast Four Provinces Charity Federation, and Nie Youxun, Director of the Disaster Area Working Group of the National Government Relief Committee, and other team members, carrying 495 bags of white rice, 5,000 bags of flour, and medical supplies, set off from Hankou on the Wanxing Wheel to the west. They docked at Xiaojinkou at 7:00 PM. On the morning of the 9th, they sailed from Jinkou, passing through various places such as Shaomaoshan, Dazui, Donggelao, and Dengjiakou, and arrived at Paizhou at 12:00 PM and Jiayu at 5:00 PM. Because Baotazhou was known as a den of thieves, they were unable to proceed and docked there. On the morning of the 10th, at 4:00 AM, they sailed from Jiayu, passing through Liuzikou, arriving at Baotazhou at 5:00 AM, and at Lujiakou at 8:30 AM. Suddenly, gunfire erupted, shooting at the Wanxing Wheel and the Parrot Wheel transporting rice. They opened up full power and sped upwards, finally arriving safely at Xindi after more than an hour. From Hankou to here, the journey was more than 360 miles. The floodwaters were surging, a vast expanse of water. Paizhou was affected by the Jiangwan, and the disaster situation was particularly serious. The situation in Jinkou was roughly the same. After the staff arrived in Xindi, their shock subsided. They immediately convened a joint meeting of various agencies and organizations at Xingang near the port that evening to discuss inspecting the true situation of the disaster victims and carrying out a household survey. The main decisions were: 1. Relief area: From Zhujiafeng in Houping Township in the upper reaches to Fanjiuzhou in Maobu Township in the lower reaches, and to Yangjiazu in Xuping Township in the inner river, a total of more than 50 li from east to west and 10 li from north to south. 2. Survey method: The team members will work with local organizations to convene the Pao-Tung and Chia-Chang of the various disaster areas to conduct detailed surveys, limited to the poor and orphaned. Those under 12 years old are counted as small households, and those over 12 years old are counted as large households. The survey must be completed within three days. 3. Relief distribution method: First, relief tickets will be issued, specifying the date and location for distribution, and distribution will be carried out under the maintenance of order by the military and police. On the morning of the 11th, at 8:00 AM, they met with the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, the chief of the Public Security Bureau, and others to investigate the disaster situation in the lower townships, passing through the Old Coffin Temple, Maopu Township, Yejiuzhou, Wangjiuzhou, Hujiuzhou, and Ganjiuzhou, with an estimated 2,000 disaster victims. On the morning of the 12th, at 8:00 AM, they investigated the Zhujiazu area in the upper townships. In this area, seven or eight sections of the street embankment were broken by the water, the widest being more than six zhang. A large number of houses collapsed. In summary, all the places inspected had become a land of water, with fields and houses submerged in water. Most of the disaster victims along the river were crowded on the dikes that had not collapsed, with thatched sheds lined up one after another, resembling villages. Those living in the open air accounted for two or three tenths. There were also entire families living on boats, who had not had a full meal for several days. In the inner river areas, due to the lack of dikes and hills, many disaster victims lived in the houses that had been submerged but had not collapsed, living on wooden frames. Others built nests in trees, and their remaining belongings were placed on the roofs. The tragedy of the disaster is truly rare. The team is now providing relief and is scheduled to complete its work within three days and return to Hankou before the 20th.</p>
<p>Fankou: The second relief team, led by Du Yannian and Qian Jinjian, left Hankou on the 11th and went east to Fankou, which belongs to Echeng, to provide relief to the refugees. They arrived in Echeng at noon and contacted the chairman of the County Chamber of Commerce and the head of the Security Regiment to agree to divide into 20 groups and go to the places where the disaster victims were gathered to conduct detailed surveys. In the afternoon, they inspected various places inside and outside the county seat, which were deeply flooded. The disaster victims were crowded on the city walls, and their state of hunger and cold was too terrible to behold. On the morning of the 12th, the ship sailed directly to Fankou, which is five li from the city and has the most serious disaster situation. The disaster victims were all camping on the nearby mountains. Although they were barely surviving, they were spared from drowning, but they were exposed to the wind and rain and could not withstand hunger and cold, which was also very sad. As for the disaster victims' households, according to the team's survey results, there are a total of more than 331,000 people in the county, of whom more than 138,000 are living in temples and ancestral halls, and building straw sheds in the open air, and are truly homeless. More than 83,000 people are in urgent need of relief. 318,146 mu of farmland have been flooded, and there is no harvest of early and late rice. About 5% of the elevated areas yielded crops, and about 2% or 3% of buckwheat. (September 16th)</p>
<h3>Jiujiang Disaster Victims Cry Out in Hunger and Cold</h3>
<p>Disaster Victims Number Over 150,000</p>
<p>Relief Funds are Few and Far Between</p>
<p>Refugee Shelters Have Not Been Implemented</p>
<p>Jiujiang Correspondence: In nearly a hundred years, Jiujiang has only experienced four major floods. The first time was in the fourth year of the Guangxu reign, the second time was in the twenty-seventh year of the Guangxu reign, and the third time was in the fifteenth year of the Republic of China. The highest water level of these three major floods was 44 chi and 9 cun. The dike collapses all occurred in the early sixth lunar month. The water began to recede a few days before the White Dew solar term, and could be completely receded within half a month after the Mid-Autumn Festival. Farmers could still replant, and the number of casualties and collapsed houses was also extremely limited. However, the scale of this flood and the magnitude of the losses are not only unprecedented, but also unheard of. At its highest point, the water level reached 45 chi and 5 cun, creating an unprecedented new record. The White Dew solar term has passed several days, and the river water is still rising and falling intermittently. It has never fallen to 45 chi. According to old farmers, if the water rises during the White Dew solar term, it will be difficult to recede during the heavy snow season. This means that there is no hope for winter crops this year, and no harvest can be expected for the next season. The number of people drowned exceeds 2,000, and floating corpses are still being discovered in the river. The value of the property lost is in the millions. It will be difficult to restore the area to its former state within ten years. In previous floods, disaster victims could still flee to other places to survive. This year, however, there were major floods everywhere. Those who fled to Anhui traveled through several counties for several days without getting a single meal. There was no way forward and no way back. More than half of the refugees died of starvation or disease. Some were so angry that they committed suicide by drowning, hanging themselves, or strangling themselves. In the past few days, the Jiujiang authorities have finally started to build sheds in preparation for taking in refugees, and the disaster victims have returned in droves. However, their number is less than half of what it was when they left. Those who fled to Nanchang have been temporarily taken in by the Provincial Relief Association, and the Department of Civil Affairs has ordered the Jiujiang County Government to send personnel to bring them back as soon as possible. It also ordered the suspension of issuing passports to refugees seeking food outside, and immediately recalled those that had already been issued. Although the orders have been issued, the disaster victims are unwilling to sit and wait for death. Therefore, in the past week, according to the provincial newspaper, more than a thousand people have still fled to Nanchang. In total, more than 25,000 people have been issued passports by the County Government to seek food outside. More than 16,000 people are scattered in the Xun city. These more than 40,000 disaster victims are mostly people from Fengkuo Township in the ninth district north of the Yangtze River, which is closer to Xun. The remaining disaster victims in Sangluo Township in the eighth district north of the Yangtze River, which is closer to Hukou and Pengze, and Chisong Township in the seventh district south of the Yangtze River, which is closer to the second, fourth, fifth, and sixth districts of Jiujiang County, are only relying on surplus grain and seeds to satisfy their hunger. The rural order is extremely chaotic, and the official authorities cannot maintain it. Looking to the future, one cannot help but feel apprehensive. In addition, there are more than 100,000 disaster victims who still have surplus grain and seeds, so they are still living in sheds and tents on the dikes, eating one meal of porridge every day or every other day. If there is no assistance after another month and a half, the food supply will also be exhausted.</p>
<p>The progress of relief efforts is rather slow. For example, Liu Zhi first donated 5,000 yuan in cash to relieve the disaster in Gan, which was allocated by the provincial government. Jiujiang received 600 yuan. This 600 yuan has not yet been distributed today. Furthermore, the Relief Association resolved to allocate 3,000 yuan in silver dollars to Jiujiang for emergency relief. The notification of this 3,000 yuan has only allowed the Nanchang Chamber of Commerce to pledge 900 yuan. In addition, 1,900 yuan has been raised from various places. Since the disaster began on August 1st, it has been more than a month and a half, and only 2,800 yuan in relief funds has been received. Using this to provide relief to more than 150,000 disaster victims is truly a drop in the bucket.</p>
<p>The temporary pledge of plowing cattle has been established, and its fund is 2,000 yuan. This 2,000 yuan is also allocated from the 2,800 yuan in relief funds. Currently, more than 200 plowing cattle have been collected, but due to poor management, more than half have died. Zhou Baipeng, a member of the National Government's Water Disaster Relief Committee, came to Xun to inspect and was very disapproving. He then joined Jiang Qun and other members of the Jiujiang Water Disaster Relief and Recovery Association (now renamed the Water Disaster Relief Committee) to select four locations: Lianhuadong, Shilipu, Gaochangmiao, and Mao Shanqi Tou, to set up cattle sheds to avoid the outbreak of cattle epidemics. However, due to the continuous rain, it has not been possible to start building the sheds.</p>
<p>Regarding the distribution of porridge, there was no order before August 29th. Some people received porridge tickets for five or six people, while others could not get a single ticket for five or six people. The Relief and Recovery Association discovered this problem and convened the disaster victims at the Dajiao field to verify their names and issue new tickets, so that it was evenly distributed. However, there was too little porridge and too many monks, and many of the weak waited all day without getting a meal. Moreover, those in charge of cooking the porridge did not pay attention to cleanliness. The rice was only washed once before being put into the pot. The pot was buried in the ground, and mud and flies fell into the pot as it cooked. When the porridge was cooked, it looked like mung bean porridge, and the disaster victims could not swallow it. They requested that rice be issued so that they could cook it themselves. The Relief and Recovery Association did not approve this for fear of carelessness. As for the rice for the porridge, it was the 2,500 small bags (equivalent to 500 bags) donated by Xiong Shihui, and the 82 bags of rice smuggled for export that were seized by the Xunhu Rice Grain Inspection Office. Very little was purchased, and what was originally available is now almost exhausted.</p>
<p>The refugee shelters are currently being built actively. The one run by the Water Disaster Relief Committee can accommodate 10,000 people, and the one donated by private individuals can accommodate 1,000 people. It is expected that they will be able to start taking in refugees around the 20th of this month. It is planned to provide one porridge and one meal per day, with able-bodied men working in exchange for relief. The work-for-relief plan includes: First step (1) Leveling the base of the old city wall and filling in the nearby ditches to increase official property, and as a preparatory project for extending the Huan Cheng Road and building the Jiujiang-Hukou Highway in the future. (2) Digging up soil from the Dajiao field mountain and filling in the Lianhua Pond in the city, which is most prone to flooding, to increase official property. The second step is to repair the breaches and repair the dikes. The third step is to repair the county road between Jiujiang and Huangmei. The first step of the project has been inspected by Zhou Baipeng and Jin Shizhong, an engineer from the Junpu Bureau, who believe it is feasible. Jin Shizhong and the planner Liu Lixiu are currently preparing a budget, and construction will begin as soon as the relief funds are distributed.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Charity Relief Association recently remitted 20,000 yuan, which was handed over to Zhou Baipeng to handle emergency relief. This money is currently stored in the Central Branch Bank and has not been touched. Zhou is scheduled to go to the ninth and eighth districts north of the Yangtze River and the seventh district south of the Yangtze River, which have the most serious disaster situations, for a week starting on the 16th. Then, he will issue disaster victims with exchange coupons printed in half-yuan denominations, which they can take to nearby entrusted stores to exchange for cash. Distributing 20,000 yuan in relief funds among more than 150,000 disaster victims is like trying to put out a fire with a cup of water. Moreover, the northwest wind has been quite strong these days, and even wearing lined clothes does not feel warm. It is truly tragic that the disaster victims are crying out in both hunger and cold.

<h3>Zhenjiang-Yangzhou Transportation Temporarily Suspended</h3>
<p>Yangzhou Correspondence: Regarding the water situation in the canal, a report from the Jiangdu section yesterday stated that the water level at the Sanggou Gate had dropped from one zhang and five chi to one zhang and four chi and eight cun, and then rose another cun, currently standing at one zhang and four chi and nine cun. However, water has still flooded into the cities near the Yangzhou East Custom House. The Shaoti dam construction project was suspended for one day on the 15th due to wind and rain. The entire city of Shaobozhen is covered with rubble, and rotting corpses are still floating in. The Shaobozhen Flood Relief Association has dispatched laborers to clean the streets and wash away the stench for the sake of transportation and hygiene. It has also determined the number of disaster victims and is distributing porridge daily. In addition, in Xinghua County, which was most severely affected by the disaster, there are still 300,000 disaster victims, including 2,000 who are gathered in the county hall awaiting relief. County Magistrate Hua is helpless and has telegraphed the Jiangsu Charity Relief Association, saying that ships will be dispatched to transport them to Yangzhou. The office here is also unable to accommodate them and has telegraphed the General Association for instructions. Transportation between Yangzhou and Zhenjiang was completely suspended on the 15th, and Shanghai newspapers have not arrived. It is said that because the people downstream are afraid of the river tide backflow and the waves eroding the dikes, a gong-beating crowd incident occurred again on the 15th. The various shipping companies have decided to temporarily open the Zhenqing-Zhenyou route (the Zhenjiang-Yangzhou short route is temporarily suspended). The Taixing-Taidong-Taiyan three-wheel route in Taixian has been opened by the Dada, Dasheng, Dayuan, and Jiangtai four companies to transport refugees, and relief passes will be sold along with the tickets. It will be implemented on the 16th.</p>

<h3>Central Disaster Survey Committee Arrives in Bengbu</h3>
<p>Surveying the Disaster Situation and Inspecting the Water Situation in the Lower Reaches of the Huai River</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: This year's flood in Anhui Province has been classified as second class by the central government. Yan Zhuang, a member of the Executive Yuan's Relief Committee, and Hong Hui, a member of the Relief Committee's Disaster Survey Committee, have successively arrived in Anhui to handle disaster survey and relief matters. Zhao Jianan and Gui Fang, relief workers dispatched by Yan Zhuang, recently came to Bengbu with 50,000 yuan in relief tickets to handle emergency relief in Wuhe, Shouxian, Huoqiu, and Linhuai in northern Anhui. Hong Hui completed the disaster survey in southern Anhui and arrived in Bengbu early on the 15th with an engineer, staying at the Transportation Villa. They met with local gentry to investigate the flood situation. According to Hong, they will first investigate the disaster situation in the lower reaches of the Huai River and the causes of the disaster, and then go to the disaster areas in the counties along the Huai River to conduct separate surveys. They will conduct a detailed investigation of the Huai River situation and implement a work-for-relief method to guide the Huai River and repair the dikes in the future. At 2:00 PM today, Hong and others took the first train to Linhuai and then to Wuhe to survey the disaster situation and the Huai River water situation. (September 16th)</p>
<h3>Shandong National Flood Emergency Relief Association Established</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: This year's flood in the Yangtze River Basin is vast, and as many as 35 counties in this province have been flooded. Millions of disaster victims are crying out for food and relief is urgently needed. Li Shuchun, the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, proposed organizing the Shandong National Flood Emergency Relief Association at the 82nd provincial government meeting to provide relief, and submitted the organizational outline. After discussion, it was decided that the provincial committee, the president of the high court, and the secretary-general of the provincial government should review it, make slight amendments, and submit it to the provincial government's standing committee today. The review case was approved and the association was organized and established on the same day and began its work. The organizational outline of the association is recorded below: Article 1: This association shall be organized by two members of the provincial party department, two members of the provincial government, two members of the military agencies, two members of the provincial relief association, two members of the mass organizations, and one member of the Jinan municipal government, appointed by the provincial government.

<h3>Strengthening Coastal Defense in Fujian</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Guangxi's troops have invaded the border of Hunan, which has been reported in the newspapers. The Fujian Provincial Government also recently received reports that Guangdong has recently sent troops under Huang Renhuan and Zhang Ruigui to garrison Raoping, Dabu, Raoping, and Pingyuan in the area bordering the four counties of Zhao'an, Pinghe, Yongding, and Shanghang in Fujian Province, with the intention of entering Fujian. The government immediately telegraphed Zhang Zhen, the commander of the 49th Division of the Land Army stationed in Zhangzhou, to deploy troops to strengthen the border defense in case of emergency. Yesterday, we received a reply from Commander Zhang stating that he had followed instructions and ordered his subordinates to strictly defend and await orders. However, according to a report from an agent stationed in Chaozhou and Shantou, the Guangdong troops stationed in Chaozhou and Shantou, although claiming to be two divisions, are actually less than one division strong. They are digging trenches and holding firm, using them to defend against our army's suppression, with no intention of advancing. It is said that Chen Jitang's troops only have four divisions, most of which are in the Shaoguan area. The remaining troops are gathered in Guangzhou, ostensibly to prevent internal changes, but in reality, they have no spare capacity to invade Fujian. In order to strengthen the border defense, the provincial government ordered the division to strengthen its defenses and, given that the Guangdong-Guangxi military conflict has already broken out and the defense of southern Fujian is of great importance, appointed Fang Shengtao, the Director of the Security Department, to inspect the lower reaches and allocated 50,000 yuan for the inspection expenses. Fang is waiting for provincial committee member Lin Zhiyuan to return to the province before departing. He will first go to Xinghua, then to Quanzhou, Xiamen, and Zhangzhou, and will take about three weeks to return to the province.</p>
<h3>About the Nakamura Incident: Chen Xingya Departs to Investigate</h3>
<p>Speaking to Reporters, He Encourages Himself with the Word "Impartiality"</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: Since the Nakamura Incident occurred, the friendly relations between China and Japan have suddenly become strained. The case remains unresolved, and complications have arisen. Vice Commander Zhang, to demonstrate our sincerity, has specially dispatched Northeast Gendarmerie Commander Chen to investigate the truth, hoping to establish a foundation for a peaceful resolution of this incident. Mr. Chen, accompanied by over twenty staff members, departed on the thirteenth for the Xing'an reclamation area. The following is a record of his conversation with reporters: (Question) Sir, you have been ordered to depart for an investigation, a mission of utmost importance. What steps will you take to conduct the investigation? (Answer) Sino-Japanese relations have always been harmonious. Since the negotiations over the Nakamura Incident began, they have turned bleak. International disputes depend on peaceful understanding. Investigation is the basic work to obtain a peaceful resolution. Before obtaining the true results of the investigation, I do not wish to comment on the incident itself. This time, I have been ordered to depart, and I will uphold the word "impartiality" in my actions. I will conduct a careful investigation with an objective attitude, and I will never favor one side, to show our sincerity, and hope to achieve the purpose of a peaceful resolution. (Question) What will be the future steps in the negotiations? (Answer) My mission is a purely investigative task. When I return from the investigation, it will be the end of my personal mission. The future steps in the negotiations are the task of the diplomatic authorities. (Question) What is your estimate of the future outcome of this case? (Answer) International peace depends on the coordination and understanding between nations. I have already said this before. The Chinese nation takes courtesy and peace as the foundation of its nation for thousands of years. We do not wish others to impose upon us what we do not wish to impose upon others. Sino-Japanese relations are as close as lips and teeth. If we can understand and support each other, we can maintain the permanent glory of both nations. The so-called Nakamura Incident is a small matter. After this "impartial" investigation, the clouds will clear and the sun will shine, and we will enter a smooth path towards a peaceful and satisfactory resolution.</p>
<h3>Anhui Provincial Government Officially Handles Special Tax</h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Regarding the issue of opium prohibition in Anhui Province, since the Central Opium Prohibition Committee established opium suppression and investigation offices in Bengbu, Wuhu, Datong, and Anqing, and appointed Hao Zihua as the director, the people of Anhui believed it was a disguised form of opium public sale, and protested vehemently. Later, the Opium Prohibition Committee and the Executive Yuan simultaneously issued orders to abolish the offices. The Anhui Provincial Government also followed the order, instructing all counties to supervise and abolish them by a deadline. At that time, the establishment of suppression and investigation sub-offices in various townships and towns, which the suppression and investigation office had planned to establish, was also suddenly suspended. Although the Central Government issued a clear order to abolish the suppression and investigation office, Hao Zihua has been running around between the province and Bengbu, with a very active attitude. The suppression and investigation head office and the Wuhu branch office are also proceeding as before. The work of suppression and tax collection is becoming more intense, all under the direction of Section Chief Kong Qizhong. Whether the tax money is still reported to the Central Government or directly sent to Anqing is unknown. At the same time, rumors of renaming and reorganizing the suppression and investigation office are also widespread. Indeed, the provincial government's 214th meeting last week put forward the discussion. Because it had already obtained the approval of Commander-in-Chief Chiang, it formally passed the establishment of a special tax office in Anhui Province, and still appointed Hao Zihua as the director. The reason why the provincial government must handle the special tax may also be caused by the environment. According to the propaganda from the special tax office, this year's flood in Anhui Province is unusually heavy. The people are miserable and in dire need of relief. Opium prohibition should be strictly enforced, and disaster relief is especially urgent. The method of prohibition emphasizes clearing up. Investigating the private planting households in this province is a violation of the law. However, in this autumn of severe disaster, after the harvest, if no change is made, not only will drugs accumulate, causing endless troubles, but the people's only hope for survival will be plunged into desperation. Now, in order to be lenient to the past and strictly prohibit the future, so that drugs can be suppressed and the disaster-stricken people can be relieved, we have referred to the successful cases in Henan and Hubei and handled the special tax. After this case was passed, Hao immediately telegraphed Section Chief Kong Qizhong to go to the province from Wuhu to formulate regulations and actively prepare. The head office will still be located in Wuhu. However, due to the floodwaters not receding, it is inconvenient to handle matters, so it is planned to temporarily set up in Bengbu. However, Wuhu is close to the Yangtze River and is the main hub for the import and export of special goods, so it has been decided to set up a branch office first. Now, the office has drafted a notice explaining the reasons for the establishment and notifying the people of Anhui, and ordering special merchants and planting and smoking households to abide by the regulations and not to seek impunity.

<h3>The Comintern and Soviet Russia's Conspiracy</h3>
<p>(Continued from VIII)</p>
<p>(Question) What is your opinion on these matters? (Answer) We must immediately send a comrade there, telling him to pay attention to our mass work and to follow the Comintern regulations. As for political workers, there is no shortage of them. All the comrades who have already been sent there should stay there temporarily. We must also send a military comrade, but these troops of ours need not be used to attack the enemy. We only need to pay attention to correcting our lines and seeking accurate methods and strategies for working among the peasants, so as to fulfill the responsibility of the revolution. The peasants there must be organized and given military resources to increase the prestige of our army. The business strategy must also be changed. We believe that this is the most important and appropriate method in the current situation. However, this issue has not yet been discussed by the Politburo, it is just our opinion.</p>
<p>(Question) We will raise this issue for discussion at the next Politburo meeting and explain it.</p>
<p>Moskin: To say that the enemy is gaining ground and our army is no match is an exaggeration by the comrades. In my opinion, the situation there is indeed extremely difficult. If we cannot make our army raise its prestige to protect western Fujian, then we will lose a very reliable base area. The enemy, on the other hand, will be able to consolidate its forces and plan to attack our central area. Therefore, Moskin advocates changing the route of advance, planning to go directly from southwestern Hunan to Chaling. Now, our Party's 20th Army Corps has mutinied there. He hopes to go to that corps to conduct a short period of movement, select the best part of it to bring back to the Red Army, and then go to Zhu and Mao's place. It takes only ten days from Shanghai to Chaling, and another ten days to Zhu and Mao's place, a total of twenty days.</p>
<p>News of the 7th Regiment: A comrade has arrived from this regiment via Guangdong and has not yet received a detailed report. However, we know that the 7th Regiment had 5,000 men and 3,000 guns in September 1930 (the 19th year of the Republic of China). It decided to unite with Zhu and Mao, so it once went from Guangxi to the southwest of Hunan Province, and soon returned to Guizhou from southern Hunan, heading east to northern Guangdong. When this comrade left the regiment, its headquarters was in southwestern Jiangxi Province. The roads they have traveled before and after are more than 2,000 miles. On the way, they did not do any work among the workers and peasants. Their only task and purpose was to join Zhu De and Mao Zedong. The regiment fought many times with the enemy and was defeated each time. Now, only 1,000 men and 700 guns remain.</p>
<p>Mattner has gone to He Long's place and sent a letter stating that due to difficulties with the ship, he must arrive five days later. He expects to meet He Long today. Re, Gedecco, etc. have gone to the 1st Regiment, but they have not yet received letters from them.</p>
<p>A report has also been sent from the 10th Regiment in northeastern Jiangxi Province, saying that Luo Zhanglong (transliteration) has successfully united and started work there. The political agent recently sent to the 10th Regiment is suspected of helping Luo Zhanglong.</p>
<p>Resolution of the Congress on the 20th Regiment: The problem of the 20th Regiment has been unanimously agreed upon. It also discussed the need for comrades to trust each other and to fight against Luo Zhanglong, etc. This resolution will be notified to all Red Armies in the name of the Politburo.</p>
<p>Qibiretnov is now going to the 1st Regiment. Moskin has some doubts about each other's actions, thinking that this move is very obstructive to the work of the Politburo. However, I think Qi's trip does have several special functions. A good steamboat has now been found. In a certain period of time, these comrades will decide how to continue their journey. Cyl's secretary will also travel with them.</p>
<p>Speletnov requested a special meeting to discuss the military strategy of our 1st Regiment in the resident area, but we are not very familiar with the situation in this area. The peasant movement in the area is very strong, and we have no power to manipulate it. How are the class opinions in the villages different? It is said that there are many anti-Red Army troops. What kind of strategy should we implement to deal with them? Our military experience in this area is very weak. In the central area, we only need to fight one warlord group, while in the resident area of the 1st Regiment, we have to fight several warlord groups. They cannot communicate with each other, so our strategy must be more flexible and opportunistic. This is an immutable principle. However, the geographical combat situation is indeed beneficial to the enemy and not beneficial to us. The enemy comes from the railway and the river, which is extremely convenient for transporting people and equipment. We have twenty comrades on the Ping-Han Road, one of whom is the leader of the Party League. We are asking military comrades for instructions on military strategy and action, and we also need to ask for instructions on how to contact and deal with the bandits in various places. There are many bandits there. We have two opinions. If we see that they can be used, we will allow their bandit army to act in the name of the Red Army and with Red Army slogans. At that time, Gedecco expressed his opposition, saying that no political or organizational relationship can be established with these bandits, so this issue must be decided by the Congress.</p>
<p>Policy on dealing with peasants: In the resident area of the 1st Regiment, the peasant movement has developed greatly. There are many peasant associations. For example, there is a very prosperous peasant association in western Anhui. We are now using this association to do our good work, but from another point of view, the leaders of this association do have a tendency to form a separate faction. How should we act? We need clear guidance.</p>
<p>Finally, the issue of the duties of Party workers was discussed. The Party's work in the 1st Regiment has not been successful so far. Who is responsible for this? We do not know. Therefore, we need to send many comrades to organize well. (Question) We have records of the work in the resident area of the 1st Regiment. Now, the most important thing is to change the method and improve its work. The methods of political work and mass work are clear, and there are Comintern regulations to follow. We have told you about these issues many times. Now, based on various regulations, we are preparing to draft a detailed plan for you. Although this is just a draft, you can use it to solve many military problems. If there are other issues that are not mentioned in this plan, then you can decide and handle them according to the situation. You must prepare personnel and immediately send them to work in the 1st Regiment. As for what kind of personnel are needed, this instruction also states it.</p>
<p>Moskin: It was previously decided that ...4... before, 27 comrades should be sent to be responsible for military and political work in the Soviet areas. Some of them are assigned to the 1st Army Corps. The plan for the work of the 1st Regiment drafted by Comrade Speletnov can be said to be roughly correct, but please hold another special meeting with the comrades in charge of military affairs to discuss it.</p>
<p>(46) Talks with Xiang (Zhongfa) and Gorupin on April 7</p>
<p>Xiang (the following is his talk): A comrade from the Central Committee in charge of internal liaison was arrested on April 5 (Sunday). The location was inside a trade union building. When he was arrested, he was found to have a letter from the comrades in Liaoning Prison to the Red Relief Society, a letter from the Provincial Committee (the content is unknown), a letter from the Central Committee to the National Labor Union, 1,000 yuan in foreign currency, and an address of the Anhui Provincial Committee. One receipt for the comrades of the Central Committee groups. After he was arrested, the police were on constant guard there, so soon another seven comrades were captured. Among these seven people, one was the Liaison Director of the National Labor Union Action Team, one was the Liaison Officer of the Red Relief Society, one was the Instructor of the Unemployed Workers, and the others were the Personal Liaison Officers of the Central Committee (including one woman). The arrest of the first person was caused by taking risks. (Asdre asked what he meant by taking risks, but Xiang only replied that according to a certain report). Xiang continued that this arrested comrade had been working in the Central Committee for a long time, so he was deeply trusted. In 1927, he was Xiang's private secretary, so he was very familiar with the addresses of the thirty-one people currently responsible for important work in various places (including twenty-two people working in the various groups of the Central Committee, three in the Provincial Committee, four in the Trade Union, and two in the Red Relief Society). Since they were familiar with our addresses, we had to move immediately and inform the Technical Department of the Provincial Committee to find a new house. Xiang also said that in order to implement this plan quickly, he had convened a meeting in a certain hotel. The number of attendees included the Liaison Director of each district, the Personal Liaison Officer of the Provincial Committee, the Liaison Director of Shanghai, and a certain Technical Secretary of the Provincial Committee. In order to avoid attracting the attention of others, they had to shout loudly during the discussion, but unfortunately, this caused the intervention of the watchman and summoned the police.</p>
<p>Asdre: Why are you so panicked when only a few people are arrested? Are you recklessly appointing untrustworthy comrades to this important work, which leads to not being able to trust them?</p>
<p>Xiang: Because the first arrested comrade knows our situation very well, and he is very weak, so we have to be cautious.</p>
<p>Asdre: Have you not heard that the liaison work of the Central Committee does not need to be done like this? Why are there so many Liaison Directors? How many are there now? Why do the comrades in the Central Committee have to draw receipts for their living expenses? What are these receipts for? In my opinion, these Liaison Directors should be cancelled immediately, and they should not be given any other titles. Because once there is a director, there must be several secretaries under the director. Following this, will we not increase a huge amount of expenses? The Party's money must be distributed according to the overall needs. It is really impossible to favor any aspect, including the comrades employed by the Central Committee. We have mentioned this to you many times, but I did not expect that it is still the same today. Moreover, if the number of people is small, on the one hand, it can save money, and on the other hand, it can avoid danger.</p>
<p>Xiang: We have also tried our best to reduce the staff in various places, but so far it has been ineffective. This kind of problem is very easy to talk about, but very difficult to implement. Moreover, in such an environment, if there are not so many people, how can the responsibility of liaison be carried out, will it not be more restrictive?</p>
<p>Asdre: You may hand this matter over to the Bureau for handling, and then refer to our plan. You can try to reduce the existing 150 people by at least half. The principle is that every comrade can be effective and can get an accurate distribution in work.</p>
<p>Xiang: Feng (Yuxiang) recently sent two representatives to contact us. One of them used to be our comrade. It is not clear what the purpose of his contact with us is. Moskin had a conversation today with someone who used to be one of our comrades. It is only known that Feng has now realized his past mistakes and is eager for us to provide assistance. Moreover, Feng plans to go to Berlin via Siberia in the future. Pang, the former commander of the 2nd Division of the National Army (now in Shanghai), and Tan's troops also have a tendency to contact us. This issue requires the instructions of the Congress.</p>
<p>Asdre: You can immediately report the results of Moskin's conversation with the representative and the purposes of the other people mentioned above, so that we can have a basis. What I want to mention to you today is the letter we wrote to you last time, because the enemy is now working hard to eliminate and divide the internal Red Army. We should pay very close attention to this point. It is too strange that three representatives of the enemy are contacting us at the same time. We should be cautious in all aspects and not easily sign contracts with them or agree to any conditions. At most, we can only use them. We must remember that they are our enemies, not our friends. Or even because some of our comrades are currently working in their troops, they are eager to fool us. We will consider it in detail when your report is submitted.</p>
<p>Xiang: We have recently received a report saying that some comrades are currently contacting the officers under Yue Weijun (Yue himself was previously intercepted by us on the Ping-Han Road). The person in charge of the contact is Peng, an officer of that department. They are willing to redeem Yue for 100,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Asdre: You can immediately notify the comrades of the 1st Army Corps and tell them to act cautiously. The most important point is to strictly imprison Yue and not let him escape. Also, tell them not to kill this person, because killing him is useless. We must keep him as a guarantee.</p>
<p>Xiang: We recently sent Comrade Tong Mingxuan (transliteration) to Henan to serve as secretary. He was originally a textile worker in Shanghai. He was arrested for something and tasted the iron window for a year. He has just been released from prison. He is indeed a very good comrade.</p>
<p>Asdre: What kind of work did he do before he was arrested? When exactly was he released from prison? Has he fully recovered to his original state now? Politically speaking, does he have a firm spirit?</p>
<p>Xiang and Ge: Before he was arrested, he was the secretary of a certain group. He was released on New Year's Day this year. He still worked as usual after his release and completed a short-term training in the Party.</p>
<p>Asdre: It is best to give him some time to rest before he goes to Henan. His expenses will of course be provided by the Red Relief Society. In short, we must first help comrades recover their health, and then provide them with daily necessities before we can get practical results.</p>
<p>Recent reports on various strikes</p>
<p>The recent strike of 24 silk factories was launched at the same time. At that time, we only had contact with four factories and seven female workers. The youth comrades only had contact with two female workers. In a certain silk factory, there are twelve female workers who are very close to each other. Now we are trying to get close to them. In addition, we also have a public female workers' school. As for the aforementioned seven people, four of them are our comrades, but they are very timid. Most of the work and guidance given to them by the district committee cannot be carried out. Even when meetings are held, they do not attend. The Party originally promised to give them one yuan for each meeting they attended, but now it has stopped paying them, so they have refused to attend. During the strike, we did not do any work. Although this strike was launched at the same time, it was very short-lived. At most, it was only three days before work was resumed. The Kuomintang forced a silk factory to resume work during this strike. The silk factories that resumed work were resumed voluntarily by the workers. Therefore, their goals were completely unachieved. Only one silk factory with 800 workers agreed to increase the wages by 50%. We anticipate that this kind of strike will be repeated soon, so we are now preparing everything. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>A Robbery and Kidnapping Occurs in Dazhangjing: Last night (16th) at 9:30 PM, the house of farmer Han Lisheng in Tu Ji Village, No. 7 Tu, Dazhangjing, a southwestern suburb of the city, was suddenly visited by seven or eight bandits carrying a pistol, iron bars, and daggers, etc., forcing the victim to tell them where the silver was hidden. Han said that he was poor and had no money. They then pried open the wooden box and searched it. They only found one hundred copper coins and nothing else of value. The bandits were angry and kidnapped his seven-year-old son, heading towards the southwest Pudong bank. The victim was hit in the waist with an iron bar and stabbed in the little finger. He immediately reported it to the City Second Police Station, which sent police to investigate, but returned without success. Today, the First District Office reported the situation to the County Government, requesting that it be ordered to rescue the child.</p>
<p>Letter Announcing the Start of Emergency Repair of the Sea Dike: Xue Xingbei, the director of the Jiangnan Water Conservancy and Sea Dike Engineering Office, along with Standing Committee Member Sun, County Magistrate Shen, Bureau Chief Sun, Regiment Commander Cao, and various gentry, inspected the sea dike at Jinshanwei on the 13th. Technical staff member Shen Baozhang was left there to oversee the project. He himself went to the province to report the situation to the Water Conservancy Bureau, which approved an allocation of 10,000 yuan to purchase materials such as wood and stones and transport them to the work site for emergency repair. Work officially started yesterday. Director Xue recently sent a quick letter to Chairman Cai of the Chamber of Commerce, saying that with the 20,000 yuan already received, emergency repair work is underway to reassure everyone. However, the tide has been high in recent days, and the water level in the low-lying streets and along the rivers in the city is almost level with the banks. If the weather is clear before the 18th day of the lunar calendar this month, danger can be avoided.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Request to Transfer Jurisdiction in the Case of Public Security Personnel Being Accused: Xiao Gensheng, who lives in Junziju Alley outside the South Gate, was detained by the Public Security Bureau for selling opium. Xiao Gensheng's mother and son were sentenced to imprisonment and fined over 200 yuan. At that time, Xiao wanted to pay Director Lu Zhibin of the Public Security Bureau and various section members and clerks a bribe, with receipts as evidence, in order to avoid being punished. Unexpectedly, the judge still imposed a fine. Xiao then revealed the matter of the Public Security Bureau's personnel accepting bribes in court. Then, the county government considered it necessary to thoroughly investigate this case and conducted a preliminary investigation. The trial was scheduled to open on the 19th of this month. The accused, such as Section Chief Lu, because of their close relationship with County Magistrate Tan, who also handles judicial affairs, submitted a petition to the county government, stating that the case had been petitioned to the High Court for transfer of jurisdiction and requesting that the files be sent. Yesterday, it was heard that the county government had approved it, and the case files could be submitted on the 17th.</p>
<p>Three Canals in Henan Section, Jointly Dredged with Nantong County: The southern end of the Three Canals in Henan Section of Shazhou City was blocked by port dams built by farmers in the Fourth District. The authorities have repeatedly advised and explained the conditions. The farmers in the Fourth District began to remove it, and the work has already started on the 14th and was completed yesterday. However, the conditions discussed by the Fourth and Fifth Districts this time are that the Fourth District (one of the districts removing the dam) should propose to the Fifth District that the downstream of the Thirteen Weir Port Three Canals in Nantong be jointly dredged by the Fourth and Fifth Districts. Now that the Fifth District has recognized this condition, the people of the Fifth District agreed to open the dam, otherwise they would rather die than comply. As for the downstream of the Thirteen Weir Port Three Canals to be dredged this time, it belongs to the southern border, and its route is about eight or nine li. Nantong County has already negotiated properly.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Coastal Defense Against Sea Bandits: In the sea areas of Tong, Ru, and Hai counties in northern Jiangsu, it is now the season for fishermen to catch jellyfish, and sea bandits have come again. There are as many as ten bandit ships drifting in the sea, with more than 300 bandits. They invaded Dayu Town, burned and looted, kidnapped people, and injured police and militia. The counties have now sent police teams to defend against them. Knowing that there is preparation, the bandits retreated northward in large numbers. There are still five bandit ships anchored in Juegang.</p>
<p>Methods for Soliciting Clothing and Bedding for Disaster Victims: Tongyi has set up a total of ten shelters to accommodate disaster victims from various counties along the Grand Canal in northern Jiangsu, with a total of more than 3,000 men and women. The disaster victims are all thinly clothed, and some are even unable to cover their bodies. Various groups and organizations are launching donations to prepare clothing and bedding. On the one hand, primary and secondary school students throughout the county are soliciting donations widely. The county government, considering the custom of Haimen, a neighboring county, where dowries are often given when daughters are married, and many families often have a lot of accumulated cotton quilts, specially sent a letter to County Magistrate Zhang of Haimen, asking him to send personnel to households to solicit old quilts and send them to Tong to be given to the disaster victims.</p>
<p>The Issue of Increasing the Surcharge on Salt Fields: Nantong's fields have always been divided into people's fields and salt fields. The tax rate on salt fields is very light. This year, the local funds are insufficient and there is no way to open up new sources of income. After deliberation by the Finance Rectification Committee, it was decided to increase the local surcharge on salt fields by two yuan. The county government submitted a report to the Provincial Transport Office for approval. The Transport Office has ordered the various salt fields in the Yuzhao area to immediately convene the salt farmers to discuss and reply.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>A Bizarre Homicide Occurred on Dongxin Road. Hua Guisheng, a Jiangbei native residing at No. 7, Dongxin Road, outside Guangfu Gate, opposite the Liao Sheng Theater, was 50 years old. He cohabitated with a woman surnamed Xie and ran the Hua Jing Ji Stone Company, possessing some savings. In recent years, the relationship between the cohabitating couple had been strained, leading to frequent arguments. On the 16th, another dispute erupted, with both sides exchanging taunts and refusing to yield. The argument escalated into a physical altercation. It is unknown how, but Hua's kidney area was injured. He immediately turned pale, collapsed to the ground, and his breath became faint, on the verge of death. Xie, realizing the gravity of the situation, immediately hired someone to fetch Dr. Zhu Chaoliang from Tongren Hospital to treat him. However, Hua had already died and could not be saved. Afterward, the local Second Precinct received the news and dispatched police officers to investigate, but they could not ascertain the truth. The circumstances of Hua's death are quite bizarre. After the incident, Hua's cohabitating partner, Xie, attempted to flee to Changzhou. Fortunately, the deceased's family intercepted her at the train station. Yesterday morning at nine o'clock, they prepared a coffin and hastily prepared Gui Sheng's body for burial.</p>
<p>Court Autopsy of Female Worker Injured by Scalding. Hongyun, the daughter-in-law of Liu Si, a guest resident of Futian Lane in the city, worked as a silk factory basin worker outside Guangfu Gate along the city wall. On the 26th of last month, she was scalded by hot water by a fellow worker, Qin Shenshi, leaving scars. Liu Si negotiated with Qin and arranged for medical treatment. Unexpectedly, Hongyun died on the 16th of this month in the afternoon. Yesterday, the ward leader Wu Shuntai, along with Liu Si, reported to the county court's prosecutor's office at 3:30 PM, requesting that someone be sent for an autopsy. The autopsy revealed that she had died of illness following the burn sustained during her life, and her family was instructed to prepare the body for burial. Qin Shenshi was taken into custody pending review.</p>
<p>Letter Requesting the Return of Borrowed Launches. The Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce received letters from the Taihu Lianghe Company's Wuxi Branch and the Ruishengxiang Steamboat Bureau, stating that they were ordered to dispatch six launches, including the Xinyufufu, Feihuang, Xinqingrui, Xinzhenxing, Nanlong, and Xieyu, to Zhenjiang to transport and rescue refugees. They complied and set sail to Zhenjiang on the 29th of last month and the 2nd of this month, respectively. It has been over half a month, and they have not been returned. Now, the water level in Wuxi is low, and transportation can be restored. However, there are no launches available to operate. They are at a loss and requested their return. After receiving the letters, the Chamber of Commerce sent an official letter to the county government yesterday, requesting that the aforementioned launches be identified and returned.</p>
<p>Appeal from Brewers Regarding Compulsory Tax Payment. The Wuxi tobacco license tax was contracted to Dou Luyi for collection this autumn. He rigorously reorganized the brewers in the rural areas and established a branch office in Xinan Huadafang Village in the southern countryside. He ordered the peasant households to register and pay taxes according to regulations, and those who violated the regulations would be summoned and punished. Currently, 94 peasant households, including Mo Yongsen, from the town, jointly submitted reports to the Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau and the county government, stating that the rural households in remote areas have no capital or licenses. They only brew alcohol during farming slack periods using agricultural products, using the dregs to feed pigs and livestock, and the manure to fertilize the fields to increase production. This is different from large-scale wholesalers and retailers. This type of sideline business for farmers, although small, has the basis for improvement and should be encouraged. Moreover, since the implementation of tobacco and alcohol licenses, it has been more than 20 years, and there has never been an order to collect taxes from these rural households. Even in Jiangbei Taixing, Wuxian Hengjingdu Village, and other places where more alcohol is produced, there has never been an order to rural households to pay taxes and obtain licenses. This year's flood was particularly severe, and Xinan, bordering Taihu Lake, was severely affected. Most of the farmers are already destitute. If taxes are levied indiscriminately, the farmers will not be able to bear it. They request that measures be taken to stop this and save the impoverished people whose livelihoods are on the verge of collapse.</p>
<p>Suzhou and Changzhou Counties No Longer Accommodating Refugees. The Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Department of Civil Affairs stated that the Jiangbei disaster areas are vast, and refugees are flocking in large numbers. They planned to arrange for Suzhou and Changzhou counties to accommodate them. The Wuxi Party and government agencies stated that the county is actively raising donations to provide disaster relief. If a large number of refugees were transported to Wuxi, there would be no suitable accommodation places, and the local people would be disturbed, which would hinder disaster relief efforts. Therefore, Hua Yisan, the chairman of the disaster relief committee, Li Tiping, the executive member of the county party department, and Qian Sunqing, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, went to the provincial capital together with County Magistrate Chen to separately meet with Chairman Ye of the provincial government and Director Hu of the Department of Civil Affairs. They explained the truth and requested that they be exempted from sending refugees to Wuxi. They were informed that they had just returned to the province from inspecting Jiangbei and knew that the true refugees would find it difficult to resume their businesses in the future and would not easily leave their hometowns. It had been decided to change the plan and temporarily abandon it. Yesterday, the county government also received a telegram from the province stating that Jiangbei refugees had been divided and telegraphed to Huai'an, Huaiyin, and Taixing counties to prepare accommodation centers by a certain date to accommodate them in different ways. The previous proposal to add accommodation centers in Danyang, Wujin, Wuxi, and Wuxian counties should be investigated and canceled by telegram. The county disaster relief committee has telegraphed to the fellow-townsmen associations in Beijing and Shanghai, as well as the Suzhou Wujin Chamber of Commerce, to inform them.</p>
<h3>Danyang</h3>
<p>Village Robbery and Assault. More than a dozen bandits armed with guns broke into the home of Zhao Shengtong, a farmer in Zhao Xiangli Village in the southern countryside, at about ten o'clock last night. They first restrained Zhao Shengtong, tied him up with ropes, and burned him with fire to force him to hand over cash. The remaining bandits dispersed to search and rob before fleeing with a roar. The case has been reported to the police for investigation.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Suining Representatives Plead for Troops and Relief. In Suining, local bandits have been rampant recently, abducting more than a hundred teachers and students in the county. The floods are also extremely severe, and the people are suffering greatly. In addition to sending telegrams to the province to request rescue, local agencies and organizations also sent Zhu Bohong as a representative to the province yesterday to petition for help. After arriving in the province, Zhu visited Chairman Ye of the provincial government, Director Hu of the Department of Civil Affairs, Director Li of the Security Department, and Hu Jianchun, the director of the Jiangbei Temporary Disaster Relief Association, to plead for troops and relief. According to the results of their petition, regarding the banditry, the Department of Civil Affairs and the Security Department have already telegraphed the Jiangsu Pacification Superintendent to dispatch troops to suppress them. Regarding the local armed forces, Director Hu of the Department of Civil Affairs promised to change the County Public Security Bureau into a section and allocate a portion of the funds to expand the county police force. Regarding disaster relief, Director Hu and Director Hu promised to pay special attention, and Director Hu also approved an order to the county to ban brewing alcohol to save grain for the people's food.</p>
<p>Departmental Committee Orders Telegram Survey of the Situation on the Eastern Embankment. The Provincial Department of Civil Affairs previously received telegrams from Suzhou, Songjiang, Changzhou, and Zhenjiang counties, stating that the people of Gaochun County were about to release water from the Eastern Dam. Because it had a great impact on the counties south of the Yangtze River, they specially commissioned Jiang Fuqin to go to the county for investigation. Yesterday, Jiang telegraphed from Chun to report on the situation of the embankment, saying that he had gone to the Eastern Dam for inspection with local officials and gentry and saw that the foundation of the dam was intact, the water was four inches over the dam, and the people of Wan had no intention of opening the dam. However, the disaster situation was extremely severe and needed urgent relief.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Accident Involving Shunli Kerosene Boat Results in Eight Deaths. The Shanghai Meida Kerosene Company recently entrusted the Qiaji Sailing Ship Company to transport 1,000 pairs of oil barrels, worth about 20,000 yuan, to the Shaobo branch for sale in the Shunli sailboat. When it sailed to Erdaoqiao in this territory, it could not move upstream due to the rapid flow of the canal and was anchored there for about two weeks. A few days ago, it was suddenly hit by a strong wind, which broke the mast of the boat. In addition, the rapid current of the water caused the entire hull to be shattered. The goods drifted with the waves. It is said that there were eight crew members on the boat, all of whom were killed. Their bodies drifted away without a trace. The Qiaji Sailing Ship Company, after hearing the news, has sent Zhang Jingshui to Yangzhou to investigate the truth of the accident and has also sent people to recover the bodies.</p>
<p>Live Burial Case Occurs in Baimamiao. Tong Lixiang, a farmer in Baimamiao in the fourth district of this county, had a quarrel with his clansmen Tong Xinquan, Tong Xinkun, and Tong Xinyou on the ninth of this month. He was tied up with ropes by Xinquan and others, beaten, and then buried alive in a nearby rice field. Later, the deceased's son found out about it and reported it to the police for investigation. It is now known that the prosecutor's office of the court dispatched Prosecutor Ju and autopsy officials to the scene of the incident yesterday to dig out the body of Tong Lixiang. He was still tied with ropes, and the autopsy confirmed that there were injuries.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Finance Bureau Requests Extension of Land Tax Surcharge. Xu Maojian, director of the Jiaxing County Finance Bureau, stated that He County had suffered continuous floods, and many crops had been submerged. The farmers were struggling to raise funds for rescue and could barely cope. The deadline for the land tax surcharge was approaching. Director Xu telegraphed the Department of Finance yesterday, requesting that the surcharge be extended. He also instructed the officials of Jia and Xiu to inform the tax collectors to continue collecting the tax at the original rate of 4 yuan, 1 jiao, 6 fen, and 4 li before receiving provincial orders.</p>
<p>Removal of the Director of the Xinfeng Chamber of Commerce Branch. The Jiaxing County Chamber of Commerce previously appointed Feng Tongzhai as the director of the Xinfeng branch office. However, the merchants in the area jointly opposed it and requested the revocation of the appointment. The Chamber of Commerce ignored this, which led to a worsening relationship between Feng and the merchants in the town. Later, Feng was also elected as a standing committee member of the meat industry and contracted to collect slaughter surcharges. He even asked for hundreds of yuan from his colleagues in the name of fees. Members collected evidence and filed a complaint with the judiciary. The court summoned him several times for interrogation and ordered him to pay a bail bond and await summons. On the 16th, several representatives of the meat industry requested the County Chamber of Commerce to order Feng to hand over the affairs of the association. At the same time, the Xinfeng merchants submitted a request to replace the director of the branch office. The County Chamber of Commerce stated that, according to the Trade Union Law, it currently had no authority to order him to hand over the affairs of the association and would review the matter after the judicial department resolved it. The Chamber of Commerce decided yesterday to approve the request of the Xinfeng merchants for a replacement and set the 22nd to convene a meeting of the members of the branch office in the Xinfeng Town Office to elect three candidates to report to the Chamber for approval.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Accident Caused by Overloaded Tugboat on the Qiantang River. Wang Zemin, the commissioner of the Jiangxi Eastern Party and Government Committee of the Headquarters of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, came to Hangzhou from Jiangxi at the beginning of this month to meet with Chairman Zhang of the provincial government to discuss refugee and border defense issues between the two provinces. Later, due to the departure of the troops, he rushed back to Jiangxi Eastern and chartered a private boat owned by Mao Mingquan. Yang Yongnian from Guo Zaihang acted as an agent. Unexpectedly, the boat owner and the agent colluded and secretly loaded heavy objects. When they reached the Mengjia Yan area, they were hit by waves and the entire boat capsized. Wang and his ten entourages fell into the water. Fortunately, they were rescued by the Tiana Wheel. Very few official documents and belongings were saved. Wang has sent a letter to the provincial government, ordering the Department of Construction to severely punish the Guo Zaihang and others to avoid danger to passengers.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Theft Case in Shenjia Shetou. Du Chuchao, a resident of Shenjia Shetou, Xia'an Village, Yisi Township, Yuyao, made a living by farming and had some savings. At about ten o'clock last night, as he was about to go to bed, more than a dozen bandits suddenly broke into his house, holding pistols, and ransacked the house for about an hour. It is estimated that they stole more than 200 yuan in cash and many pieces of clothing and miscellaneous items.</p>
<p>Jiangbei Shore Water Police. The Jin Changxiang sesame oil shop, located at the corner of Yangshan Dian Lane next to the Xiaocai Market on the Jiangbei shore of Ningbo, accidentally started a fire while frying sesame seeds at about one o'clock this morning. The fire spread to the neighboring Yongdexing paper store, Dehe cigarette paper store, and more than a dozen households, including Li Yaoting's residence. The fire was extinguished after more than three hours. It was found that the destroyed houses were all owned by the Li family, and all the affected households had fire insurance.</p>
<h3>Shangyu</h3>
<p>Attempting to Dissuade Husband from Arguing, Suffered Humiliation and Committed Suicide. Zhang Guixiang, a farmer in Zhuling Bridge, West Township, quarreled with his neighbor, Xiao Liansheng, over the latter's failure to return several liters of rice borrowed during a heavy rainstorm on the 20th of last month. Zhang Guixiang's wife, Liang Meiying, went to mediate after hearing about the quarrel. Unexpectedly, Zhang Guixiang turned his anger on his wife and tried to assault her. Liang Meiying, seeing the situation was not good, fled into Xiao Liansheng's house. Zhang Guixiang, in a fit of rage, followed her in. Liang Meiying, in a state of desperation, turned around and struck him with a stool. At that moment, her aunt, who had just received news from a Buddhist nun's house, rushed over and saw her daughter-in-law hitting her husband with a stool. Thinking she was a shrew, she entered Xiao Liansheng's house and tried to drag her back to punish her according to family law. Liang Meiying, seeing the situation, rushed out and ran away. Her mother and son followed behind her. Unexpectedly, in a split second, Liang Meiying disappeared. Zhang Guixiang's mother and son initially suspected that she had fled into Zhang Xiaogou's house next to the road and even asked Xiaogou to hand her over. Shortly after, a crab-catching shepherd boy from the village reported that Liang Meiying's body had been found in a nearby river. They then realized that she had committed suicide by drowning. The mother and son were filled with remorse.</p>
<p>Chen A'gen, a Person Involved in the Case, Arrested. Ying Fengwu, the former director of the Wufu Public Security Bureau, had a misunderstanding with the local people on the night of June 7 while they were arresting Patrol Officer Sun Shengwu and policemen Wang Fenglin and Zhang Jun for gambling, which led to a conflict. Ying fled out of the side door of the bureau and somehow drowned in a nearby river. Subsequently, the county government arrested and imprisoned nine people who were the ringleaders in catching the gamblers, including Yin A'yuan, Zhou Siyi, Li A'xian, Fan A'tong, Jia Duanfu, Zhu Guobiao, and Fan Guozhen. However, Chuan Liu Jiu and Chen A'gen, an officer from the bureau, were still at large. The case had been investigated several times, but a verdict had not been reached. It is now known that Chen secretly returned to the town a few days ago and was discovered by the police officers of the Public Security Bureau, who arrested him and sent him to the county.</p>
<h3>Taizhou</h3>
<p>Representatives Go to the County to Petition. The additional fee on the Haimen steamship in Linhai, which the provincial government decided to use a quarter of it as an additional educational fee for the county, has been outstanding for nine months. The steamship company has refused to pay and has repeatedly been ordered by the county government to pursue payment, but without any substantial results. Therefore, the County Party Department and various legal organizations and schools in the county sent more than 20 representatives to the county government at 9:00 AM today (the 15th), requesting that the person in charge of the Haimen steamship company be detained and forced to pay. County Magistrate Xu Shixian received them and approved their request. The representatives then left.</p>
<p>Theft Occurs in Datian Town. More than a dozen bandits broke into the Yuanmao Nanhua store in Zhongjie, Datian Town, East Township, Linhai, last night and stole silver, cash, clothing, and other items worth more than 1,000 yuan, and also kidnapped a six-year-old child.</p>

<h3>Women's Volleyball Finals - Wuben Wins Championship</h3>
<p>3-1 Victory over Haixing</p>
<p>Haixing's Skills Also Very Good</p>
<p>There are two teams with great reputation in the Shanghai women's volleyball world: Wuben and Minli. Since the decline of Minli, Haixing has risen, so Wuben and Haixing stand side by side in Shanghai. In the Shanghai Women's Volleyball Tournament, the above two teams fought fiercely for the championship. As expected, they met in the finals yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. With the sound of the drums, Wuben's ambition filled the sky, and they defeated their opponents with a score of three to one, winning the women's volleyball championship. This is a great story in the history of Shanghai sports.</p>
<p>(1) Zhang Junwei Assembled Troops</p>
<p>With a Call to Arms, the Warriors Were Inspired</p>
<p>Wuben's success or failure depended on this battle. The honor was tied not only to the team but to the entire school. However, every ball game is driven by vigor. Without raising the military's prestige, how can victory be expected? Even if one cannot take up arms and charge forward, one should shout and cheer to help, fulfilling one's duty. Unanimously, they assembled in groups on the east corner of the field, four to five hundred people, forming a towering human mountain. With a call to arms, the sound shook the fields. The warriors' morale was high, and the momentum was strong. They struggled from defeat, initially forming a balanced situation, and then continued their efforts, finally achieving success. The result of the warriors' efforts was also due to the encouragement of their companions.</p>
<p>(2) Wuben Team's Talents Are Average</p>
<p>The Whole Team Is United, Advancing and Retreating in an Orderly Manner</p>
<p>Wuben's victory over Haixing was not easy. The three players in the first row, Wang, Zhang, and Li, were agile in their shots, especially Zhang Biru, who was excellent at blocking. Xue Zhijie in the second row was the soul of the team. Her skills in setting, passing, and spiking were all superb, like Jiang Taigong being here, with no taboos. It is a pity that the old wound on her finger had not healed, otherwise, she might have achieved even better results. Qian Shuyi on her left was a powerful setter who scored many points. On the right was Zhu Shangfu, who was relatively softer, but the final success came from her hands, making her a lucky general. The third row was excellent at saving balls, and saving a ball is equal to serving a ball, all of which can be relied upon to score points and win. Wang Jinfeng was good at returning blocks and escaping from danger. The left and right assistants were also capable. The talents of the whole team were average, and they cooperated well. As for the clever strategy and orderly advance and retreat, it was due to the guidance of Li Feiyun. The full team list is as follows:</p>
<p>First Row Second Row Third Row</p>
<p>Wang Xuehua Zhu Shangfu Xiao Jieying</p>
<p>Zhang Biru Xue Zhijie Wang Jinfeng</p>
<p>Li Bo Qian Shuyi Lu Meiyun</p>
<p>(3) Haixing Team Unlucky</p>
<p>Each Individual Was Excellent, But Lacked Cooperation</p>
<p>The Haixing team brought together the essence of various schools. Each individual talent was outstanding, and everyone praised them. However, they had not been formed for long, and lacked cooperation. In the third and fourth sets, they were unlucky and failed. The performances of Wang Nengchun in the first row and Guan Liuzhu, Situ Wei, and Huang Xingfen in the second row were praised by the audience. Separately, the first row was excellent at returning blocks, the second row was powerful in spiking, and the third row was unable to save the situation. The whole team was scattered or gathered, and leaks were frequently seen. The reason for the failure was partly due to this. Coach Li Xinbiao repeatedly gave opportunities, but it was difficult to turn the tide. The full team list is as follows:</p>
<p>First Row Second Row Third Row</p>
<p>Su Zuqi Huang Xingfen Huang Ping</p>
<p>Wang Ruochun Situ Wei Tao Yun</p>
<p>Hou Yufen Guan Liuzhu Yin Linzhen</p>
<p>Wuben Team That Won the Women's Volleyball Championship (Photographed by This Newspaper)</p>
<p>(4) With a Great Reputation, Capturing Passes and Breaking Forts</p>
<p>Haixing's First Win Was Very Easy</p>
<p>At the beginning of the match, Wuben served the ball, and Hong Ruochun struck back with a backhand, hitting the key point and winning a point. Hou Yufen added twelve points, and Haixing took the lead with 3-0, with great momentum. It became 6-2, and shortly after 11-6 to change sides. Wuben, intimidated by the enemy's reputation, appeared flustered, full of thorns, and struggling to move forward. Haixing was invincible and won every battle. Wang Ruochun and Situ Wei made the greatest contributions. The front and back three rows were neat and impressive. Their victory over the enemy was very easy. As a result, Haixing won the first set 21-14. At the beginning of the second set, Wuben still did not gain momentum until Qian Shuyi served, starting from a tie of 5-5, and rising steadily. The credit goes to the first row's infinite changes. After 11-6, Wuben's momentum was even stronger. Xue Zhijie led the whole team, striving to be active, and soon won the second set 21-16.</p>
<p>(5) United Efforts to Overcome the Enemy</p>
<p>Turning Defeat into Victory, Wuben Succeeded</p>
<p>The third and fourth sets were extremely tense. Haixing relied on individual skills to seek development, while Wuben used cooperative efforts to deal with them. At the beginning of the set, Haixing took the lead with 4-1. Wuben followed, and after a tie of 9-9, there was another score of 13. Haixing took the lead each time, while Wuben followed closely. Finally, thanks to the strength of Wuben's third row, they won the third set again with 21-19. In the fourth set, the two teams were evenly matched at first. Later, Haixing made progress, once leading with 11-9 and 17-13. But Wuben's cooperation suddenly showed great connection, turning danger into safety, and finally won with 21-19. The referee was Tan Tianpei.</p>

<p>Atmosphere Hot, Shanghai University Wins Jinan</p>
<p>The results of the basketball semi-finals of the four major giants were that Chih Chih and Shanghai University won the finals. Thousands of viewers, the atmosphere was frenzied. The battle between Chih Chih and Qingguang, the strength was equal. Chih Chih only surpassed in the second half, and its performance was fast and wonderful, which is commendable, especially Kong Guangyi, the main pillar of the whole team. As for Shanghai University's victory over Jinan, the situation was different, the difference was far, and the interest was also reduced.</p>

<p>Men's Basketball Semi-Finals</p>
<h3>(I) Overcoming a Strong Enemy with Determination</h3>
<p>Qingguang Lost 33 to 37</p>
<p>Amidst fervent enthusiasm, the match between Chizhi and Qingguang began. Qingguang started strong, but Chizhi resisted, winning the first half 15 to 14, a one-point lead. Although Qingguang briefly surpassed them in the second half, Chizhi, with their skilled and agile teamwork, ultimately overcame Qingguang 37 to 31. Cheers for their championship hopes rose even higher.</p>
<p>Qingguang Gains Momentum with a Two-Pronged Attack: Tan Dazhen scored the first point due to Qian Dingshen's foul. After some back and forth, Qingguang attacked from both sides, with Zhang Jinxiang of the left wing scoring a long shot. Xu Kepei also netted a backhand shot from a sharp angle. Qingguang scored five consecutive points, becoming unstoppable in just two minutes.</p>
<p>Chizhi Counters with a Point to Take the Lead: Seeing their unfavorable position, Chizhi called a timeout to discuss strategy. Sure enough, the five players worked seamlessly together, seizing every opportunity to advance and launch a major counterattack, scoring six consecutive goals. At this point, Qingguang also made substitutions, bringing in Lu Dazhen and Yu Quezi and changed their tactics, employing individual defensive strategies with tight marking. This effectively slowed Chizhi's momentum. Chizhi led 15 to 14 in the first half, winning by one point.</p>
<p>Qingguang's Revival is Fleeting: At the beginning of the second half, Qingguang suddenly showed signs of resurgence. Xu Kepei, Yu Quezi, and Zhang Jinxiang successively made contributions, quickly exceeding the score to 22 to 18. At the height of their momentum, Chizhi requested another timeout, breaking Qingguang's momentum. Chizhi then soared upwards, smoothly regaining control. Qingguang's revival was merely a flash in the pan.</p>
<p>Chizhi's Three Forwards are Unbelievably Skilled: Chizhi's victory was swift and decisive. Forwards Qian and Yang advanced like lightning, and with the ball in hand, they were already in front of the basket in the blink of an eye. Their agility and skill are rarely seen these days. Kong Guangyi's advances and retreats were composed and controlled, allowing him to attack and defend. Tan Dahua also performed exceptionally well, becoming increasingly brave and relentless as the game progressed. Qingguang was repeatedly broken through, allowing Chizhi to score eleven consecutive points, leading to a score of 29 to 22. Afterwards, the score difference remained between seven and eight points, and Qingguang was unable to recover. Qingguang's defeat was due to their inferior speed and agility compared to Chizhi, and their teamwork was not as skilled.</p>

<h3>(II) Shanghai University Reaches the Peak</h3>
<p>Jin'an Lost to Shanghai University 45 to 56. Following that, Jin'an and Shanghai University fought.  For the first ten minutes, both sides were evenly matched.  However, Jin'an suddenly took a two-point lead.  Shanghai University then deployed its two great generals as guards, Lu and Wang, and defeated Jin'an by a wide margin.  The level of interest was far below the previous match. Shanghai University gained the right to the finals. The score was 56 to 45.</p>
<p>Jin'an Takes a Two-Point Lead: Shanghai University launched a fierce attack from the start, with its three forwards dashing forward. Jin'an defended. Lu Puhui seized the opportunity to attack along the right side, scoring with one shot. Li Ruchun followed on the left. Shanghai University took an early lead of 4-0. Huang Zhaolin of Jin'an recovered three points, but Shanghai University extended the lead to 9-3. Jin'an then rested, reinforced, and changed its strategy. Wei Haiqing jumped for the ball and directly tapped it towards the basket. Huang Zhaolin caught up and scored three consecutive times, taking a two-point lead over Shanghai University, 13-11.</p>
<p>Shanghai University Reinforces with Two Great Generals: With this strategy in place, Jin'an's momentum increased.  In an unfavorable position, Shanghai University urgently called on two great generals from the reserves to join the battle. Lu Zhongen and Wang Xiliang took up defensive positions in the back, guarding the rear, allowing the forwards to attack freely. After the score reached 15-19, Jin'an began an irreversible decline. Shanghai University won the first half 33 to 19.</p>
<p>The Three Unpredictable Generals: In the second half, Li Chengyuan of Jin'an was replaced by Cai Rongrui. Although Wei Haiqing managed to score one goal, the three young generals of Shanghai University, with their skillful and agile movements and swift footsteps, roamed unpredictably within Jin'an's territory and scored ten consecutive points. At this point, Shanghai University led by a great distance, 44-21.</p>
<p>Jin'an Loses Due to Poor Defense: Jin'an's defeat was already evident, and it was not easy to recover. Although Huang Zhaolin made a long shot that connected, the situation was terminal and ultimately ineffective. However, the score gradually became closer. Shanghai University won 56-45. Shanghai University's victory was certainly due to the reinforcement of the two guards and Qian Jingyong and Feng Nianhua's wonderful shooting skills, which were executed with ease and accuracy, a true marvel. Jin'an faced an extremely sharp offensive, but their defense was not strict enough; otherwise, they could have at least reduced Shanghai University's score.  Moreover, inaccurate shooting was a major cause of Jin'an's failure.</p>

<h3>Women's Basketball Bi-Weekly Tournament: Liangjiang's Great Victory Over Jin'an</h3>
<p>Twenty-Two to Nine</p>
<p>As the series of sports competitions unfolded, the atmosphere grew increasingly tense. Yesterday's basketball game was scheduled to begin at 6 PM, but around 4 PM, many people were already standing outside the basketball court's entrance, waiting to buy tickets. When the final of the Wubu vs. Haixing match concluded on the track and field, even more people arrived, creating a massive crowd. By 5 PM, it was difficult to find a place to stand inside the basketball court. After 6 PM, countless people were unable to enter. While this situation created difficulties for the organizers, it was a positive sign for sports.</p>
<p>| Details of the Intense Battle |</p>
<p>First Quarter: Referee Zhou Jiaqi signaled the start of the game. The twelve ladies spread out across the court, each guarding their opponent, forming six pairs in pursuit of each other. Amidst applause, Ms. Yang Ren of Liangjiang scored first, opening the record. Ms. Liu Mali of Jin'an, tall and strong, ran back and forth tirelessly. Her skills were undoubtedly the best among the Jin'an players. Unfortunately, her teammates' skills as forwards were not as consistent, making it a difficult task for her to succeed alone. By the end of the first quarter, Liangjiang led 8-3.</p>
<p>Second Quarter: Jin'an's guards suddenly displayed courage and performed exceptionally well. Wang Lan's interceptions and steals were particularly praised by the audience. Although Liangjiang had renowned players like Shao Jingying, Yang Ren, and Long Jingxiong, who utilized the triangle passing formation, it was still difficult to score. They changed their strategy, passing the ball back to the rear to lure out Jin'an's defenders, and then attacking from the sidelines. They won the second quarter 5-2.</p>
<p>Third Quarter: The battle grew more intense, with the ball often staying in Jin'an's territory. The three guards of Jin'an defended against attacks, running almost continuously. However, they all fulfilled their duties, giving the forwards of Liangjiang few opportunities to shoot. At this time, the guards of Liangjiang supported the front line effectively. Wang Lan frequently made excellent moves, and Zhuang Shuyu maintained composure in motion, occasionally delivering surprises. Thus, after eight minutes of hard-fought struggle, Jin'an scored nothing, and Liangjiang only gained four points. This demonstrates the intensity of the competition at the time.</p>
<p>Fourth Quarter: Seeing the score of 17-5 on the scoreboard, the coach of Liangjiang knew that their victory was almost assured. Therefore, they substituted Long Jingxiong and Xiang Dawei with two new players, Song Wencheng and Chen Jiajun. As a result, the game became less exciting than before. However, Liangjiang still won the fourth quarter 5-4. The scorecards of the two teams are listed below:</p>

<h3>Baseball Opening Game: Liyi Defeats St. John's</h3>
<p>| Twelve to Seven |</p>
<p>Baseball is still in its infancy in Shanghai, so there are few talents. When the City Games were first being planned, there were concerns that no one would participate in the baseball competition. Unexpectedly, three teams registered, which was a pleasant surprise. Yesterday was the first act of the baseball games, featuring St. John's University against Liyi. In the end, St. John's lost to Liyi by a score of 7 to 12. The reporter knows that the readers must be wondering: Who exactly is Liyi organized by? Who are its team members? Before describing the details of the competition, I will give a brief introduction.</p>
<h3>Introducing Liyi</h3>
<p>The Liyi baseball team is organized by people who returned to Shanghai from Japan and are engaged in business. Among the team members is Zhang Jingpei, also known as Zhang Wen, who served as an outfielder for the Yokohama Chinese Athletic Association in Japan. He had a great reputation during his time in Japan. Wei Biao, also known as Wei Zongtang, who returned to Shanghai at the same time as Zhang, serves as a pitcher for the Chinese Athletic Association and has achieved good results. Li Wenxuan and Chen Guangrong also returned from the Yokohama Chinese Athletic Association and are now employed at the Yinxing Port and Yumao factories, respectively. In addition, Lin Wencheng, who used to be a pitcher for the Nanhua baseball team, is now also doing business in Shanghai and has joined Liyi. Therefore, Liyi is quite strong and has hopes of winning the championship. However, it seems that they lack practice. It is difficult to predict whether they can defeat Jiangwan (Fudan) today. We will have to explore the true situation during today's game.</p>
<h3>Game Details</h3>
<p>People in Shanghai have no interest in baseball games, so there were fewer spectators than team members. Compared to the volleyball game on the track and field, which was packed with people, and the basketball game in the basketball court, which was so crowded that there was no place to stand, it was truly frustrating.</p>
<p>Yesterday's game was divided into seven innings. The most exciting part was in the fourth inning when Liyi's pitcher hit a home run, instantly bringing back four runners. The score went from 5-4 to 9-4. Cheers erupted, with Japanese mixed with Cantonese, creating a loud wave of sound. This is because most of Liyi's team members are Guangdong overseas Chinese who were in Japan and later returned to China to do business. The other innings were not as exciting. The names and positions of the team members of both teams, as well as the scores of each inning, are listed below.</p>

<h3>National Martial Arts Competition Concludes</h3>
<p>| Nine Male and Female Athletes Selected</p>
<p>Ends One Day Early</p>
<p>Yesterday was the final day of the National Martial Arts Competition. The staff members of the department, including Chairman Chen Jiageng, Boxing Referee Chief Ye Liang, Referees Chen Xuliang and Ma Yueliang, Fencing Referee Qi Dami and Liu Desheng, Wrestling Referee Chief Tong Zhongyi, Referees Zhang Wenfa and Ding Baoyuan, and Marshals Zhu Xu and Gong Zhangqidong, etc., arrived. The competition started at 2 PM and ended at 5 PM. The weather was better than the previous two days, resulting in very good results. Before the competition, the chairman announced that the National Martial Arts Department competition dates were originally scheduled from the 15th to the 18th, but because some contestants temporarily withdrew, the competition time was shortened. They decided to select all the players for each item and each level on the same day, and then immediately begin the competition. A total of eight male athletes and one female athlete were selected. The number of competitions and the names of the athletes are listed in detail below:</p>

<p>| Quiet Audience</p>
<p>Yesterday was the day of the repechage and finals. The audience was unusually excited. Before 2 PM, there were already no fewer than a thousand people standing around the stage. Then, because the volleyball game began, the number of people decreased slightly, but there were still many people watching, and they maintained order throughout.</p>
<p>| National Martial Arts Speech</p>
<p>Before the competition, Tong Zhongyi, the director of the Shaolin Department of the Municipal National Martial Arts Hall, gave a speech on stage about the significance of the National Martial Arts Competition, detailing which actions were legal and which were illegal during the competition in order to dispel the audience's misunderstandings. The audience applauded.</p>
<p>| Welcome Wrestling</p>
<p>The excitement of wrestling has been mentioned repeatedly in the newspapers, so the audience was particularly excited, and the repechage and finals were truly captivating. The first group in the repechage was Hong Zhifang against Song Baomao. Hong's agility was mentioned before. The opponent was also experienced, but his hooking skills were slightly inferior. Hong ultimately won 2-1. The next group was Liu Qinjun against Wang Sheng. Liu was physically strong, so Wang was not his opponent. However, Wang's wrestling skills were better, so he was able to hold on for a while. In the end, Liu still defeated Wang. The strengths and weaknesses of Liu and Hong Zhifang were similar, and Hong's wrestling skills were also better, but his strength was not as good as Liu's. He was ultimately held and knocked down twice. The power of a strong contender is truly awe-inspiring.</p>
<p>| For the True Swordsmanship</p>
<p>The first group in fencing was Lu Zishan against Shen Fulin, and the second group was Wang Xingsun against Xi Juncai. Both were able to use footwork and body techniques, but Shen and Xi each dropped their swords once, which was careless. During the finals, Lu Zishan and Wang Xingsun each used lively steps and were exceptionally agile. A spectator shouted, "This is true swordsmanship!"</p>
<p>| The Last Strike</p>
<p>There were only three groups in lightweight boxing yesterday, and only one group in light middleweight. No. 26 Zhu Qingyong was the most outstanding in lightweight. When he fought against his opponent, No. 1 Shu Shaozhe, in the finals, his fists were like raindrops, striking continuously. Shu was slightly smaller, but he was not weak either. After one defeat, the referee asked him if he wanted to compete again. He proudly replied, "Compete again!" However, his strength was ultimately inferior and he was defeated. After stepping down from the stage, he was mentally exhausted. The rescue team laid him on a stretcher, gave him medicine, and sent him home in an ambulance. Tan Yijia's striking technique in the light middleweight division was particularly outstanding. Although Liu Fengming was a martial arts expert who used both punches and kicks, he had to wait for opportunities to strike and did not score as many points as his opponent. Therefore, the boxing championship still belonged to Zhu Qingyong and Tan Yijia, thanks to their final efforts.</p>
<p>| Overall Review of the National Martial Arts Competition</p>
<p>This National Martial Arts Competition is unprecedented in China. It is natural that its achievements are not amazing. However, the winners of the championships, such as Liu Qinjun and Tan Yijia, cannot be said to be anything less than satisfactory. The women's championship, on the other hand, had few competitors and was won by one person. There was no opponent in the competition, so she was recommended by the organizing committee to participate in the National Games. Although her striking technique was obviously immature, it is hoped that the women's community will pay special attention to the equipment. The protective gear used was the modern military fencing gear, because there is no suitable protective gear for martial arts. It seems that this should be gradually studied in the future to avoid being ridiculed for using foreign goods. The reviewer of the boxing competition believes that it is neither Chinese nor Western, because it is designed for leather gloves. However, without leather gloves, the opponent will inevitably be injured. With gloves, the methods cannot be fully used. This is the biggest problem for future National Martial Arts Competitions. It is hoped that the authorities of the National Martial Arts Hall will conduct a thorough study.</p>
<p>| Prize Information</p>
<p>According to the organizing committee, the prizes will be awarded after the 20th. The location has been selected as the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. All winners of the National Martial Arts Championships will be notified by the organizing committee or the Municipal National Martial Arts Hall at that time. In addition, those who have excellent skills but did not win a championship will also be awarded prizes by the National Martial Arts Hall on a selected date as encouragement.</p>

<p>Don't Remove the Weeds in the Courtyard, Anecdotes by a Vegetarian</p>
<h3>The Professor of Florence</h3>
<p>After Galileo discovered the four moons of Jupiter, he wrote an article that was published in the Starry Messenger Nuncius Siderius on January 24, 1610.</p>
<p>After this groundbreaking article was published, which would be so precious from today's perspective, the professors at the University of Florence looked down on it.</p>
<p>Faher wrote in his biography of Galileo that the chairman of philosophy at Padua did everything in his power to prevent the Grand Duke from believing in the existence of the four moons of Jupiter. He said:</p>
<p>"Animals have seven orifices on their heads, which allow air to circulate throughout their bodies, allowing them to see, stay warm, and grow. What are these seven orifices of this small universe? Two nostrils, two eyes, two ears, and one mouth. At the same time, in the grand universe of the heavens, there are two auspicious stars, two inauspicious stars, two luminous stars, and one transcendent, undecided Mercury. There are countless similarities of this kind, such as the seven metals being one example; therefore, we conclude that the number of planets must undoubtedly be seven. Furthermore, Jupiter's moons are not visible to the human eye, so they cannot have an effect on the earth, so they are useless, so they exist. Moreover, the Jews, ancient peoples, and modern Europeans have established seven days as a week and call them by the names of the seven planets. If we increase the number of planets, wouldn't we be overturning this beautiful system altogether?"</p>
<p>Galileo himself said:</p>
<p>"I would like to invite the professors of Florence to look at Jupiter's four satellites. They not only do not want to look at the stars, they do not even want to look at my telescope. They believe that there is no truth to be found in nature, truth is only in books."</p>
<p>How many of the Chinese professors are not from Florence? The native old scholars say: "Truth is only in ancient books." The foreign-returned scholars say: "Truth is only in foreign books." The lazy lecturers say: "Truth is only in the mouth." If young students believe these professors, they can be considered students naturalized in Florence. Who can build their own instruments to anchor themselves to nature? If there is such a person, I am willing to hold the broom and be his vegetarian.</p>
<h3>World News in Brief</h3>
<p>The European golf craze is now popular in Shanghai. Its origin is in big golf. According to research, golf existed on the European continent three hundred years ago. The Dutch painter Rembrandt's paintings include golf games. However, the clubs used by the people in the paintings are old-fashioned and somewhat different from modern ones. Golf is a game for the aristocracy because it takes up a lot of space. A small field is not enough to maneuver. Therefore, golf clubs in Europe and the United States charge a lot. Only the rich can afford it. However, recently, golf clubs in the UK have been considering reducing membership fees in view of the large number of people who love to play golf in order to popularize it. Small countries such as Yugoslavia are also popularizing golf. Their first golf course recently opened in Zagreb. General fans flock to it.</p>
<p>America's Crime Fever. The United States has many great industries. Recently, they have added another one, which is crime. According to a British weekly, there are as many as one million Americans who make a living by committing crimes. The annual number of cases includes 12,000 murders, 100,000 robberies, and 500,000 thefts. (Hai Ke)</p>
<h3>A Tragic Report from a Page of Bandit Area</h3>
<p>— Qifeng Louzhu</p>
<p>My friend Tang Jun serves in the 9th Division of the National Army. Last month, he was ordered to follow Commander Jiang to Gan County to suppress bandits. He traveled thousands of miles with great hardship. Now he has obtained a letter from him from Xingguo to Nanchang, which fully describes the situation in the disaster area. It is thousands of words long and makes people feel sad. The following are a few excerpts from the most important parts.</p>
<p>Tang wrote in his letter, "Of all the counties we passed through, Xingguo suffered the most severe disaster. When we first arrived (less than a week after we recaptured it), I think no one would want to come to this empty city. Now I will briefly describe the situation in this place. According to the investigation, this county had more than 20,000 residents before it was captured by bandits. Now, at most, there are less than 300 people left. Among them, women account for more than two-thirds. Most of the men are old and unable to work or have disabilities. Speaking of our supply problem, it is really difficult to the extreme. In addition to what we collect from the countryside, there are only firewood and rice. The most important oil and salt are simply impossible to purchase. Therefore, we have been eating plain rice for many days. Among them are the civilians who were captured by the bandits but did not escape. The price of the daily necessities they had previously stored (a very small amount) is really a strange story. I will also report it incidentally. Beautiful cigarettes cost two yuan per tin, salt costs one yuan per catty, foreign candles cost half a yuan per pack, white sugar costs one yuan per catty, and socks cost one yuan per pair. Kerosene costs fourteen yuan per tin. It can be said that it is extremely expensive. The market has long been empty. It is extremely miserable. The better houses have been destroyed by airplane bombs. There are still two pharmacies in the city, but the medicines are not fully stocked. There is one paper shop, selling only leftover goods. There are no other shops at all. Our team is stationed in the empty houses along the street. "Slightly omitted" Communist slogans are everywhere. Even the sides of the toilets and dung pits are covered with them. The most interesting one is "Oppose husbands beating their wives." Isn't that a joke? There are also "Down with the Cancellation Faction" and "Eliminate the AB Group" "......". This is the most obvious kind of internal division within the Communist Party. It is said that there were five or six thousand members of the AB Group of the Trotskyist faction in Xingguo County. Now the leader, Hu, has been killed by Peng Dehuai in Guangchang." Alas! Now the whole country is suffering from floods, and the people in the disaster areas are in a state of near death. How can we add to the banditry? The people are being tormented and oppressed. Our people have no one left to eat.</p>
<h3>Picking Up Lingering Sounds from the Elegant Gathering at the Daya Building</h3>
<p>— Mei</p>
<p>There is a silk and satin shop at the corner of Shilu and Sanmalu. It is called Daxin. It is intended to take the meaning of what the university calls "If you can renovate one day, renovate every day, keep renovating." The owner of the shop, Wang Yansong, took the 22nd of September as the one-week anniversary of the expansion of the business. In addition to instructing his subordinates to prepare for a grand anniversary sale, he also planned to publish a special issue for circulation. Therefore, he advertised for articles in early September, with the topic being "My Views on Saving the National Silk and Satin Industry." Another topic was "Hopes for the Daxin Silk and Satin Shop." He sincerely wanted to use the elegance of high-level articles to spread long-term strategies for salvation. His intentions were also bitter. The article submission deadline was the day before yesterday. The owner of the shop invited literary figures to hold a review meeting in the Daya Building. The meeting was not regular. It is important to record. So I will describe a few points to fill this talk.</p>
<p>The Reviewers Appointed Themselves as Chief Examiners. Those present that night included Pan Gongzhan, Hu Shuhua, Wang Xiaolai, Fang Jiaobo, Yan Duhhe, Zhou Qingjuan, Yan Esheng, Wang Xiaoying, and others. When Wang Xiaolai entered the door, he shouted, "The chief examiner is here." Then he said, "It is not easy to be a chief examiner. I am afraid I will be fined three months' salary." His words can be said to be humorous.</p>
<p>The Little Reporter Acts as a Pioneer. This review was conducted by each reviewer scoring individually, and then averaging the total score to determine the order of ranking. However, it is most difficult to start scoring each work first. The little reporter of the News Daily was pushed to be the pioneer and set the score first. Although the opinions of the chief examiners were different, the psychology of first impression was not without influence. As a result, the ranking after the overall review was not much different from the score set by the little reporter. The little reporter's effort was great.</p>
<p>Tang Naixin Was Highly Appreciated. There were seventy works submitted by women. Among them, the work of Tang Naiqi, a third-year student at the Shanghai Law School, was the best. It was thousands of words long and had many insights. The scores of the chief examiners were all above 96 points. Examiner Fang gave as many as 99 points. The public questioned him. He said, "Miss Tang is still studying and is studying law. Now she can eloquently describe the strategies for saving the national silk industry in such detail. How can we not give her extra points?" Miss Tang was so appreciated by the examiners. I can't help but congratulate Miss Tang on her future.</p>
<p>Thank You for Donating Your Royalties to Help the Disaster Victims. The royalties for the months of June and August from Tianxu Wosheng were 39 yuan and 88 cents. He Tianjian's royalty for August was 2 yuan. Zhang Shanzi's royalty for August was 9 cents. Da Zian's royalty for July was 1 yuan. Lan Qian's royalty for August was 72 cents. The total was 44 yuan and 50 cents. As instructed, it has been sent to Jin Cheng Bank for collection and used to relieve the disaster. The receipt is kept for verification. This is hereby disclosed. The editorial department of Free Talk thanks you on behalf of the disaster victims.</p>
<h3>Random Notes from Fusang</h3>
<p>— Ai Ai, Sent from Tokyo</p>
<p>The Magic of Coffee Waitresses</p>
<p>People who come to Japan for the first time must be very surprised. Why do the Japanese, especially young Japanese students, like to drink coffee so much? When we walk into a university area, the first thing we find are those small coffee shops with futurist patterns on their facades. This is just like Napoleon discovering some branches and aquatic plants before discovering the New World. It is a very interesting story.</p>
<p>According to a survey by the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, as of March of this year, there are 3,215 coffee shops and 20,043 coffee waitresses in Tokyo alone. If we could statistically analyze the consumption of customers who enter and leave coffee shops every day, it would definitely be an astonishing number.</p>
<p>Because there are too many coffee shops, the business competition is very fierce. The owners of the coffee shops try their best to decorate them in a particularly novel way. Some decorate the seats in an antique style, as if they are holding an antique exhibition. Some are at the forefront of Europeanization. Recently, a coffee shop called Nichirin opened on Ginza, Japan's Broadway. The rainbow-like signs dazzle the eyes. However, the interior decoration is gloomy and remote like a forest. The dim green lights give off endless coolness. The enchanting songs of the waitresses are tempting passers-by. It is said that the income of Nichirin Coffee Shop on the first day of its opening was nearly 2,000 yuan. Who would believe that Japan is asking about the recession?</p>
<p>Many caring people often express worry and sigh about the romance of young people and the increase of these wine and woman hedonists. However, the government believes that it is better to let young people idle and study Marx and Nichols and do those things of meeting and forming associations. They are happy to turn a blind eye to this kind of entertainment.</p>
<p>The development of coffee shops is not accidental. On the one hand, young people need the comfort of the opposite sex, and these charming waitresses are delicate and considerate confidantes. On the other hand, women are eager to find a job, and of course the easiest job to make money is "coffee waitress." At the same time, their secondary purpose is to take the opportunity to find their ideal lover among the bustling customers. Therefore, in the past, those who became "coffee waitresses" were only graduates of senior elementary schools. Now, even female teachers and female college students have become "coffee waitresses." Japanese women have no so-called chastity in the waitress era. They think that selling smiles at this time is harmless. They have deeply forgotten their own pity and lightly forgive people's sins.</p>
<p>As the lights come on, those tens of thousands of waitresses are already ready. Their evening makeup, the raven-black temples, are adorned with sad and beautiful temple flowers. The delicate faces are thinly coated with rouge. Light makeup and heavy makeup, charming in every way. They are all working hard for money and paying attention to dressing up their own beauty.

<h3>A Husband's Wife (16)</h3>
<p>— Jiang Hongjiao</p>
<p>Mr. Li felt that he had to leave in front of Mr. Chen, so he left laughing. Mr. Chen sat on the sofa by the window, silently, watching her put on socks, put on clothes, wash her face, etc., which took another hour.</p>
<p>"Can we have dinner?" Mr. Chen was a little impatient. His stomach was really starving. He had eaten something at seven o'clock in the morning.</p>
<p>"You seem to have not eaten anything for three days. All day long, I only hear you complaining about hunger. I haven't had tea yet. How can I swallow the food?" She said, and then she was busy looking for tea leaves and jasmine flowers, and then she started the kerosene stove to boil water. It was not until 2:30 in the afternoon that she had lunch.</p>
<p>"Today is Sunday. Let's go to the movies!" She ordered like giving an imperial edict.</p>
<p>"I want to write a few letters."</p>
<p>"A man, hiding at home all day long, is really going to hide and get sick. If you don't go, I will go." She said, and then walked to the door and shouted, "Mr. Li! Let's go to the movies, okay?"</p>
<p>"Then you should also invite Mrs. Li to go together!" Mr. Chen interjected.</p>
<p>"She never goes. Why go and get a rebuff again?"</p>
<p>Mr. Li came dressed neatly in clothes and hats. He opened his mouth and said, "I have been waiting for you for a long time. Let's go! If we are late, we won't be able to get a good seat. Mr. Chen, why aren't you going?"</p>
<p>"He is really my good helper. He is willing to stay at home and take care of things. Let him be!" Mrs. Chen joked with a smile, while looking for clothes to change in the closet.</p>
<p>"You speak really interestingly! You are really a man. If I were a woman, I would really want to marry you as my wife." Mr. Chen also joked with a smile.</p>
<p>"Woman? A woman like you is really bad luck!" She was fastening her clothes buttons in front of the mirror, squinting at Mr. Chen and Mr. Li in the mirror.</p>
<p>"Why? Don't you think I am a very beautiful woman?" Mr. Chen stroked his Charlie Chaplin-style mustache.</p>
<p>"Are there any women in the world who have mustaches?" She said, and everyone laughed.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, change your clothes and come with us! Come with us!" Mr. Li urged, pulling on Mr. Chen's arm. He knew that Mr. Chen would not go, so he pretended to be diligent.</p>
<p>"I really have some things I want to finish while it's Sunday. You go. It's not early." Mr. Chen felt a little sourly stimulated in his heart, and he could not immediately explode.</p>

<h3>Financial Gold Prices Fall Before Rising Again</h3>
<p>Market Situation: The spot gold price yesterday, the 17th, fell and then rose again, with unpredictable changes. There were ten taels of foreign gold in the unified market. People's hearts were unsettled. In the end, it rose again by five taels. Silver bars remained unchanged. The opening was still flat, and then it fell slightly. However, due to strong buying interest, especially from the Guangdong merchants, and the foreign exchange deficit, the market conditions became sharp, and it went forward courageously, soaring by more than ten taels, suddenly crossing the 770-tael mark. The market then rose and fell slightly, hovering around 70 taels, with a fluctuation of only three taels or so. However, a certain bank's buying interest was not strong, and the exchange rate was still stable. Finally, it closed outside 70 taels.</p>
<p>Prosperous Morning Closing: The opening of November was slightly higher by four cents, at 766 taels. The large bars did not change. Public and private telegraphic transfer rates rose by one-eighth. However, the United States had some sales, and the US stock market declined slightly, so there was no impact. However, it seemed that there were more sellers in the market. Zhifeng, Yongda, Decheng, Wupin, and Yongfeng all sold, immediately falling by more than three taels, finally reaching 62 taels and 7 cents. The British gold was barely sold at 130625. Then the bank suddenly offered October 125. Soon after, Qianchangxiang, Daxing, Yonghengxing, and others came in. It was also rumored that a certain bank also entered, and Zhengjin, Mitsui, Sumitomo, and others bought British gold for December and January 125 to 1875, so people's hearts were upward, and it has now increased by four taels. At 9:20, it was 66 taels and 8 cents. Then it fell by more than one tael, to 65 taels and a half. The British gold announcement did not change, at 6 taels and 7 cents. It then retreated to 6 taels and 2 cents. After 9:30, the buying side was active, and Hengxing, Shengda, Dayuanmao, Yongfuyu, Qianchangxiang, Zhifeng, Yongyongheng, and others bought one after another. Hengxing also fiercely bargained for British gold, and only closed at 13 in November and December. The gold market progressed rapidly, increasing by three or four taels. However, there was a slight fluctuation of one tael. At 11 o'clock, it had broken through 70 taels. Speculator Lu entered, and Hengxing continued to enter. At 11:15, it reached 73 taels and 5 cents. In an instant, Yuanmao, Yongfu, Changyuan, Hengshunli, Tongtaichang, Wanxing, and others took the opportunity to sell, immediately falling by two taels. At 11:30, it was 71 taels and 6 cents. Hengxing, Cuichang, Yong, and others entered again, and then it rose by one tael, three or four cents in ten minutes. At 11:45, it was 73 taels. At this time, the Indian exchange rate telegram had decreased by three annas, but there was no change. However, Yuanmao and others sold, so the morning closing retreated to 71 taels and 2 cents. After entering, it was re-made to one tael, seven or eight cents, and it was still suppressed to within one tael, because each firm had different entries and exits. The announced price was 790 taels and 2 cents, a discount of 23 or 4 taels to 17 taels. The morning closing was 19 taels.</p>
<p>Afternoon Market Hovering: The opening of the afternoon market was 69 taels and 8 cents, which was the remaining momentum after the morning closing. Later, because the Indian exchange rate decreased by two or three annas, it immediately rose to 71 taels and 4 cents. Before long, it retreated to 70 taels and 2 cents, and then rose by more than one tael, to one tael and a half. At 2:30, suddenly, because HSBC sold British gold for November and December 130625, people's hearts were tired, and the selling trend suddenly intensified. Tongtaichang, Yuanmao, Yongyuan, Kangxiang, and others all sold, falling by three taels. In less than ten minutes, it fell to 68 taels and 2 cents. In a moment, it rose by one or two taels again, because Zhengjin and others absorbed 0625. Zhifeng, Yonghengxing, Shengda, Datong, Taichang, Daxingyong, and others rushed to buy, and then it was outside 70 taels again. At 3:20, it was 71 taels and 9 cents, and the Indian exchange rate continued to fall by one or three annas. However, Yongfeng and others came out, suddenly falling by two taels. At 3:50, it was 69 taels and 7 cents. Hengxing Shengda entered again tirelessly. At 4:10, it was 71 taels and 4 cents. In an instant, it was reduced by one tael again, to 70 taels, and then to 71 taels. The market closed at 4:30, at 70 taels and 7 cents, which was 5 taels and 1 cent higher than the previous day. The maximum price for the whole day was 73 taels and a half, and the minimum price was 62 taels and 7 cents, a difference of 10 taels and 8 cents.</p>
<p>Spot Delivery Was Level: The spot market in the morning was 65 taels and 8 cents, the morning closing was 71 taels and 3 cents, and the afternoon was one tael, closing at 08 cents. The announced price was a discount of 20 taels or so. The registered water replenishment was both 71 taels. The spot was level, and only Yingfeng Heng slightly entered, increasing by 7 taels and 25 cents.</p>
<p>More Demand: There was more demand than supply on the trading floor. According to statistics, Hengxing, Shengda, Dadecheng, Qianchangxiang, Daxingyong, Hengxingyuan, Cuichangyong, Fuyu, Yongheng, Yuankangxiang, Fuxingyong, Futaiheng, Taifengcheng, Yifengyong, and a certain bank all entered. Zhifengyong, Yuandayong, and Yuantai had very active entries and exits. Yongfeng, Shunli, Tongtaichang, Wanxing, and Yuanmaoyong all exited. In the afternoon, Yuanmaoyong, Qianchangxiang, Dadecheng, Yuantai, Futaiheng, Tongtaichang, and Yifengyong had abnormally active entries and exits. Daxingyong, Hengxing, and Shengda all entered. Yongfeng, Wanxingyuankangxiang, and Shunli had more exits than entries. A certain bank continued to buy without hesitation. Guangdong merchants entered a total of more than 4,000 bars before and after the market, which was a bullish addition. Then 600 to 700 bars were sold. Dalian merchants were still short, exiting a total of 2,500 bars, and entering 1,200 to 1,300 bars.</p>

However, Japanese firms such as Yokohama Specie Bank and Mitsui had a strong appetite, which allowed the market price to remain stable. The total transaction volume was approximately £200,000, with only 100,000 to 200,000 US dollars traded.

<h3>Cotton Yarn Market Shows Slight Improvement</h3>
<p>The yarn market has not undergone any major changes, but the trend is slightly firmer. This is because major players intend to cover their short positions this month. The near-month market is relatively strong, and the far-month market is also being pulled up. However, most people believe that the severe floods in various regions will inevitably lead to disappointment in the future. Therefore, they are unanimously selling short, while manufacturers are observing and waiting for changes before taking action.</p>
<p>Major Players Covering Short Positions in the Current Month: At the opening of the Renbiao market, the market sentiment was extremely weak, and the atmosphere softened. Prices for all months fell by 0.02 yuan, except for the far months, which rose by 0.02 yuan. In the afternoon, major players covered their short positions in the current month, leading to a firmer market tone. Additionally, the price of three-grade yarn rose, and prices for all months increased by 0.05 to 0.07 yuan. The total transaction volume was 17,650 bales. Buy orders included 1,100 bales for Gongtai, 1,250 bales for Tianlong, 600 bales for Gengfeng, 300 bales for Lichang, and 500 bales for Ruidah. Sell orders included 1,400 bales for Meiji, 700 bales for Deji, 550 bales for Gengfeng, and 450 bales for Changfeng. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>
<p>| Item | Closing Price | Change | Open Account |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| September | 153.9 | Up 0.04 | 444,012 |</p>
<p>| October | 153.1 |   | 372,150 |</p>
<p>| November | 152.  |   | 290,502 |</p>
<p>| December | 151.7 | Up 0.01 | 93,402 |</p>
<p>| January | 151.9 |  | 73,552 |</p>
<p>| February | 151.6 | Down 0.02 | 39,252 |</p>
<p>Yarn Sales are Not Bad: The sales of spot yarn are still good. According to statistics, various traders bought a total of 1,100 bales throughout the day. Traders within the industry bought 600 bales, and Han traders bought 800 bales of futures. The market is flat. Among the traders from other regions, Guangdong bought 185 bales, Han traders bought 155 bales, the inland region bought 75 bales, northern traders bought 50 bales, Tianjin bought 75 bales, Sichuan bought 160 bales, and miscellaneous traders bought 100 bales.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Weakens</h3>
<p>Rumor of the US Lending a Large Amount of American Cotton to China</p>
<p>The cotton market is showing signs of weakness. This is due to the decline in imported cotton prices and the rumor that the US government will lend 600,000 bales of American cotton to China on credit. This rumor is increasing the pressure from all sides, and many are selling off their holdings. However, Han traders are actively buying because of the severe floods in their regions, which have caused significant damage and made it impossible for them to deliver goods to Shanghai. The general situation is pessimistic, and the future is uncertain.</p>
<p>Han Traders Compete to Sell: At the opening of the Hanbiao market, the market conditions were very weak. Because American cotton had fallen again, major players sold off their holdings at the closing, due to the rumor that American cotton would be lent to China on credit. Prices for all months fell by 0.01 to 0.02 yuan. The afternoon was flat, and the gold market stabilized. Prices for all months rose by 0.005 yuan. The total transaction volume was 61,800 dan. Sell orders included 5,400 dan for Changhe, 5,300 dan for Xincheng, 2,500 dan for Yuda, and 5,400 dan for Dachang. Buy orders included 3,900 dan for Houfeng, 2,700 dan for Shenchang, 2,400 dan for Ruidah, and 2,500 dan for Xinfeng. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>

<h3>Foreign Yarn and Cotton Decline Again</h3>
<p>American Cotton: South Selling Short. Yesterday, American cotton was initially firm due to positive news from Liverpool, but weakened due to selling from the South and favorable weather. Futures fell by 13 to 16 points, and spot fell by 10 points. British cotton futures fell by 1 to 2 points, and spot rose by 9 points. Egyptian cotton spot rose by 25 points. Indian cotton was slightly bought by Japanese traders and brokers. The market was calm and stable. The price of Pingguoer rose by 0.75 rupees, Omla rose by 1 rupee, and Bairoxi rose by 1.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded below (16th telegram):</p>

<h3>Grain: River Rice Market Sales Stagnant, Prices Weak</h3>
<p>South Market: Yesterday, there was a slight influx of goods from various regions. Although the weather was damp and overcast, retail sales in urban and rural areas were sluggish due to the approaching Mid-Autumn Festival and the lower prices in the northern market. Transactions decreased significantly. Sales were sluggish due to unfavorable weather, and prices had to be slightly lowered. The prices of thick japonica rice were not high, only recovering a small amount. Lower-grade rice had accumulated, and there was still sluggish demand for glutinous rice. This market is only interested in fresh rice. Central rice was completely stagnant. The market price was clearly fixed but secretly weakening. Given the overcast weather, the entry of new rice was hindered, and no major changes are expected. Demand for new japonica rice is declining, and the market continues to weaken. Yesterday, new Yangjian and new Dujian rice arrived from Xitang (approximately 180 shi) and Pingwang (approximately 160 shi). The quality of the rice was good. New Chuanjian rice from Jiaoli arrived (approximately 8 shi) and was of good quality, with a price of 15.3 yuan. New Xiangjing rice also arrived from Jiaoli (approximately 30 shi), with beautiful quality and a price of 18 yuan.</p>
<p>New Zha Market: Yesterday, the supply of Northern Jiangsu rice from Changshu and Wuxi continued to flood in, and there was a slight stock in the river. Retail demand was scarce due to the change in weather to sunny, and people were bearish. The prices of thick japonica, early glutinous, and thin glutinous rice all fell by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. The prices of new japonica and new Yangjian rice fell by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan. Although there were few old Yangjian, Dujian, and Bujian rice, the demand was low, and there were no significant changes in price. Modified and deteriorated rice continued to decline and sales were normal. The market was uneventful. Spot sales of foreign rice were slightly active, and the market trended towards consolidation.</p>
<h3>Large-Scale Sales of Future Foreign Rice</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign long-grain rice market was sluggish due to slightly weaker demand in this market. Foreign firms released a large number of future orders, and the market immediately reacted negatively. Both futures and spot prices weakened by a small amount. 210 bags of Jiangxi machine rice were released at a price of 14.2 yuan. 600 bags of Taizhou white rice were released at a price of 12.75 yuan to 12.3 yuan. 300 bags of Mindang rice were released at a price of 13.25 yuan to 13.2 yuan. 1,000 bags of Xiaojiao were released at a price of 13.05 yuan. Trading of future rice was very active yesterday, with all sales coming from foreign firms. 600 tons of Saigon No. 1 rice were sold at a price of 6.7 mace by Yuanli. Sassoon sold another 300 tons of October rice at a price of 6.71 mace. Mitsui sold 500 tons of Xiaojiao for October delivery, and Yuanfeng sold another 900 tons, both at a price of 6.15 mace.</p>
<h3>Flour Futures Continue to Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning and afternoon, the market for various months showed a sluggish and continued downward trend. Although the quoted price of foreign wheat recovered by about 0.2 yuan, the nature of the huge amount of chips in the market, and the fact that most of them belonged to non-industry players, was not taken into account. They were simply speculative ventures. More recently, with the agreement for a large shipment of foreign wheat for disaster relief, the poor sales prospects for flour were apparent. Therefore, after the despair of the bulls, they had no choice but to gradually sell in reverse to seek a settlement. If these buyers were actual sales traders, they could perhaps be restrained or collected upon maturity, and would not be so panicked, placing themselves in such a desperate situation. Looking ahead, if there are further transactions of Russian wheat, the market shock may need to be further intensified. As a result, September and October fell by 0.075 yuan compared to the previous day, November and December fell by 0.01 yuan, and January and February fell by 0.075 yuan.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures: Heavily Burdened, Difficult to Reverse</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market in the morning and afternoon, the market for various months continued to decline. The market situation seemed to be heavily burdened and difficult to reverse, with an inevitable downward trend. It was also rumored that a foreign firm had already received a ship of foreign wheat and would soon receive more. Since no one was interested in buying it from the factories, they entrusted brokers to sell it off in the market. This type of seller was actually delivering real goods, which made people even more nervous and dealt a heavy blow. Given that the market trend is that supply exceeds demand and the factories are standing by, the collapse in the future may be inevitable. As a result, the current month fell by 0.02 yuan compared to the previous day, October, November, and December each fell by 0.04 yuan, and January and February each fell by 0.05 yuan. The spot wheat market has been quiet for a long time. Yesterday, 16,000 to 17,000 bags were opened, which were sellers drawing and selling to prepare for delivery. Wheat from Yangzhou and Zhenjiang was priced as high as 3.6 taels, and the second grade was 3.55 taels. Wheat from Gaoyou was 3.48 taels. Shenda handled 10,000 bags, and Huafeng handled more than 6,000 bags.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Taikoo Sugar Gradually Showing Signs of Shortage</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market production area telegram stated that the price of Cuban spot sugar had not changed. The price of New York sugar futures fell by 0.01 to 0.03 yuan in the near term, while the 500-share far term rose by 0.03 yuan. The price of Javanese spot and futures sugar also remained unchanged. The guild allocated 24th grade coarse white sand sugar Dutch sugar, but buying interest was sluggish, and the number of sellers was surging. The asking price for new goods was 11.6 taels, and the asking price for new 20th grade medium white sand sugar was 11.1 taels, but few were accepted. The asking price for 16th grade medium white sand sugar was 10.09 taels, and there were some transactions, but the market was not remarkable. The sales of Taikoo Sugar in various places were slightly smoother, and the stock in the market was very thin, especially for mid-range goods, which showed the greatest signs of shortage. B mark was 11.05 taels, old goods were 12 taels. DY mark was 11.95 taels. The number of sellers was declining, and some were asking 12 taels for the future. HM mark was 11.475 taels, and the market was also tight, trending gradually. The factory prices were particularly tight, and the fixed prices for each were: B mark 5.05 yuan, CW mark 5.00 yuan, DY mark 4.95 yuan, HX mark 4.90 yuan, HM mark 4.70 yuan, and H mark 4.60 yuan, with no room for negotiation. Although the traders intended to buy, the allocated prices were too high, resulting in them being helpless and sighing at the ocean, which is a separate view amidst the boycott of inferior goods.</p>
<h3>Zhabei Goods: Newly Arrived Bozhou Peaches Sold Quickly</h3>
<p>The first batch of new Bozhou peaches arrived the day before yesterday, totaling 67 bags. The peaches were very dry and of good size. They were all purchased by Ningbo, Shanghai, and other traders, and the price was 18.5 taels. Yesterday, the second batch of 40 bags arrived, and the quality of the goods was similar to the previous batch. Given the current need for various traders, the trend is very firm, and a further price increase may be necessary.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Foreign Silk Firms: Silk</h3>
<h3>Flourishing Trade in Gongxi Green Tea</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the tea market of foreign firms in this port, there was no lack of effort from the Russian Assistance Society in searching and purchasing Gongxi green tea from Wuyuan, Tunxi, and other routes. The newly established Yulong Foreign Firm also purchased a lot. The total transaction volume for the city was over 1,200 boxes, and the trade was quite prosperous. Firms like Xiehe, Tongfu, Doud, and Yongxing were also actively replenishing their stocks of Zhenmei pearl tea and other varieties, making the market more active. Chinese merchants, seeing their inventories dwindling, were unwilling to lower prices to sell the tea they held. The future of green tea is said to be very stable.</p>
<h3>Checked Flannel Blankets Completely Searched Out</h3>
<p>Flannel is usually sold in summer. With the arrival of autumn coolness, various heavy overcoat wool fabrics have been successively launched. Flannel should have been on the decline. Unexpectedly, checked flannel has recently become popular in the market, and the selling price has suddenly risen. Upon investigation, hat makers in this street have been searching for it to make small hats. At the same time, merchants from Sichuan have also started purchasing it, leading to a sudden tightening of the trend. However, the total stock in the city is limited. In the past three days, it has been completely searched out. It is quite unexpected that goods that should be declining would have such activity.</p>
<h3>Dalian Ironmongers Urgently Procuring Black Sheet Metal</h3>
<p>The hardware trade remains slack. Apart from a few scattered transactions, there are very few large-scale deals in the city. However, the Dalian ironmongers have emerged as a force to be reckoned with, urgently procuring black sheet metal. Therefore, it is quite gratifying for the whole city. It has been found that firms like Yilong, Chengyi, Chengyong, Ririsheng, and Hengzhu have collectively purchased as many as 2,250 bundles. As for the price, 18 sheets per load are estimated at 11 taels each, 36-inch sheets from 3 to 8 sheets are estimated at 9 taels and 4.5 qian, 9 to 10 sheets at 9 taels and 7.5 qian, 11 to 12 sheets at 10 taels and 0.25 qian, and 13 sheets at 11 taels and 5 qian. It has been found that the 18-sheet variety is the most purchased. However, the inventory of this product is extremely low, so there is hope for a continued rise in the market standard in the future.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Supervisory Committee Pays Attention to the Lives of Disaster Victims</h3>
<p>Investigating Separately for Days</p>
<p>Proposes Five Points for Improvement</p>
<p>The Municipal Party Department Supervisory Committee, in light of the widespread floods and the increasing number of refugees arriving in Shanghai, even though the government has been trying to accommodate them, believes that their living conditions are worthy of attention.  It dispatched personnel to various shelters for several days to conduct detailed investigations. Based on observations, it proposed five points for improvement, which were passed by the fifth Supervisory Committee meeting the day before yesterday and sent to the Executive Committee to be forwarded to the Social Bureau for implementation. The content is roughly as follows:  "The shelters at Chaohui Villa, Quzhenren Temple, and Yongxitang on Xietu Road are temporary in nature, and it is difficult to ensure complete facilities. It is understood that the construction project of the disaster victim shelter on Liuying Road in Zhabei is nearing completion. Once the arrangements are complete, the disaster victims in the temporary shelters on Xietu Road will all be moved to Zhabei to be gathered in one place, which will be better for management and hygiene. However, based on past observations, the disorder and confusion are significant, and there is no order. Regarding the areas that need improvement, the five most important points are listed below:</p>
<p>The Supply of Provisions Should Be Uniform: The disaster victims come from Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui provinces, and Gaobao County in Jiangsu. There are differences in when they arrive in Shanghai, and the supply of provisions varies from time to time. Sometimes cash is issued, sometimes raw rice, or bread, biscuits, steamed buns, etc., are issued.  Sometimes it is issued daily, sometimes every few days, sometimes several times a day, or only part of it is issued and not everyone receives it. The methods are very inconsistent. Whenever group representatives or newspaper reporters come to inquire, the disaster victims often complain about their hardships, hunger, and unfair treatment. Those who listen and do not understand are most likely to cause misunderstandings. In the future, it is best to calculate and distribute food according to the number of people, providing two meals a day, so that the weak are not harmed. If charitable organizations provide aid, it should also be collected and distributed uniformly by the Social Bureau to avoid disputes.</p>
<p>Registration Must Be Accurate: The number of disaster victims is large, and they live scattered everywhere, both inside and outside the gates. It is not possible to prohibit them from entering and exiting at will. It is difficult to get an accurate count by checking around the room. Even when asking the staff, they only give rough estimates. Some cunning disaster victims, when their requests are not met, attack the staff when group representatives or philanthropists come to inquire about the situation, claiming that they are inflating the numbers and enriching themselves at public expense. If false information is spread and published in newspapers, it will have a significant impact on the future of disaster relief. In the future, it is best to stipulate that several people live in one room, instead of scattering them outdoors. The bedrooms should be numbered in order, and the names of the disaster victims living in each room should be pasted outside the window, so that it is known how many people are in each room. By calculating in order, the total number can be obtained. The disaster victims will have no loopholes to exploit, and rumors will naturally cease.</p>
<p>Management Should Be Strict: The disaster victims come from other places, and since there are so many people, it is inevitable that they will be of mixed quality. Whenever charitable organizations send food for distribution, they gather in a corner, scrambling and fighting for it, shouting and making noise, making it difficult to describe. The strong push their way to the front to grab more, while the weak are unable to squeeze through and can only sigh as they watch. As a result, the full become fuller, and the hungry become hungrier, which completely loses the meaning of fairness and should be improved. In the future, when aid is delivered, it should be entrusted to the staff of the Social Bureau, who will determine the quantity and, together with the police stationed there, supervise the workers to distribute it in order of the bedrooms, so as to avoid the malpractice of scrambling and unfairness.</p>
<p>Pay Attention to Public Hygiene: The disaster victims come from the countryside, and most are farmers and workers with little knowledge. Children often urinate and defecate at will in the corners of the houses and in front of the courtyards. Once it is rained on and exposed to the sun, the foul odor spreads everywhere, which is extremely harmful to hygiene. It is appropriate to designate locations and have them comply. If someone is lazy and does not move forward, the police stationed there should intervene at any time. In addition, clothing should be washed frequently, and dust and dirt inside and outside the rooms should be swept away at any time, especially leftover food.</p>
<p>Find a Way to Provide Tea and Water: In the vicinity of the temporary shelters on Xietu Road, there are no boilers providing boiled water, and the shelters have not prepared any in advance. Some people quench their thirst with raw water. Those who survive disasters are most likely to get sick. Now that they have been moved to Zhabei, it seems appropriate to find a way to prepare a large amount of boiled water for their needs.</p>
<p>The above five points are only those that are simple and easy to implement. If they can be put into practice, the disaster victims will benefit immensely. However, the disaster is huge and funds are short, and the future is long. The disaster relief funds should also be allocated daily by the Emergency Relief Association, or a special fund should be designated by the government, which would be more appropriate.</p>
<h3>Disaster Relief News from Various Provinces Yesterday</h3>
<p>News from the National Government Disaster Relief Committee</p>
<p>Zhu Qinglan's Opinion: Zhu Qinglan, Standing Committee Member of the National Government Disaster Relief Committee, expressed his opinion on the matter of allocating relief funds yesterday, saying that all relief funds donated by various sectors must be completely given to the disaster victims. All expenses, as well as any funds needed for any matters related to disaster relief, should, in my opinion, be borne by the government. I mentioned this matter to Chairman Song last time, and Song also expressed strong agreement. Therefore, all funds allocated to the disaster areas should be done in this way.</p>
<p>Japanese Representatives Arrive in Shanghai: In addition to donating a large quantity of relief supplies worth 300,000 Japanese yen, various sectors in Japan have also sent Mr. Fukao as a disaster relief representative, who arrived in Shanghai on the Nagasaki Maru at around 3:00 p.m. yesterday. Zhu Qinglan, Standing Committee Member of the National Government Disaster Relief Committee, and Guo Dehua, a representative of the Propaganda Division, went to the Huishan Wharf to welcome Mr. Fukao, who is scheduled to go to the disaster areas along the Yangtze River tomorrow with Mr. Funatsu, a representative from Shanghai, to express their condolences.</p>
<p>Distribution of Relief Funds in Jiangsu: The 300,000 yuan in relief funds previously allocated to Jiangsu Province by the National Government Disaster Relief Committee has now been allocated as follows: Jiangdu 30,000, Gaoyou 30,000, Xinghua 40,000, Taixian 30,000, Jiangpu 5,000, Baoying 30,000, Dongtai 30,000, Yancheng 30,000, Liuhe 5,000, Liyang 4,000, Yixing 5,000, Lishui 3,000, Wanchun 3,000, Wujiang 5,000, totaling 250,000. The remaining 50,000 will be given to the shelters. In addition, the Relief Association plans to set up 22 shelters: Jiangdu 3, Gaoyou 2, Taixian 5, Baoying 2, Dongtai 2, Zhenjiang 3, Rugao 1, Tongxian 2, Jieshou 1, Sishui 1. In addition, it is planned to continue to allocate 35,000 yuan worth of No. 3 flour, which will be sent by Miao Jing Xinfen Flour Factory.</p>
<h3>Joint Meeting of Relief Organizations Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Fundraising Emergency Relief Association for Flood Disasters in Various Provinces convened a meeting yesterday of various flood disaster relief organizations in Shanghai at Renji Hall to jointly discuss ways to coordinate. The representatives from various organizations who attended included Qu Yingguang, Wang Xiaolai, Li Zutan, and Wu Zhihao from the Emergency Relief Association, Wang Yiting from the Qing Sheng Association, Zhu Yinjiang from the Chinese and Foreign Joint Relief Association, Li Hanyin and Luo Dingchen from the Swastika Society, Lu Wenzhong from the Lianyi Charity Association, Liu Zigu from the Hubei Emergency Relief Association's Shanghai Office, Xu Jiyu from the Wuhu Charity Relief Association, Ren Jinping from the Ning Shao Relief Association for the Hankou Disaster, Xu Shao Liu from the Jiangsu Charity Relief Association, Li Lishu, Director of the Huai Huai Si Investigation and Relief, Ye Kaixin from the Hunan Fundraising Shanghai Office, and Yuan Ying from the Chinese Buddhist Association, among others, totaling more than ten people. Qu Yingguang was elected as chairman. First, Li Zutan gave a report, saying that the scope of this flood disaster is vast and the number of disaster victims is large, which is unprecedented. Various charitable organizations in Shanghai, based on the spirit of human mutual assistance and the compassion for the hungry and drowning, have risen up to raise donations with great enthusiasm. However, in order to understand the relief situation clearly and to promote mutual assistance and cooperation, it is necessary to connect with each other. This is the main purpose of today's meeting. Then, each representative expressed their opinions separately, and they all agreed that the mutual assistance and connection between the organizations is beneficial to the progress of disaster relief. Finally, it was decided to organize a joint meeting of Shanghai flood disaster relief organizations, and Li Zuyu was publicly elected to draft the meeting's charter. The organizations that attended the meeting jointly initiated the meeting and decided to reconvene next week to discuss the charter. The meeting adjourned at around 5:00 p.m.</p>
<h3>Current Situation of Municipal Shelters</h3>
<p>Since the completion of the first shelter in Zhabei, the situation at the Shanghai Shelter for Disaster Victims Office has gradually become more organized as disaster victims are concentrated in the shelters. However, the number of disaster victims arriving in Shanghai every day is very large. The Jinghu train arrived at the North Station the night before last, carrying about 500 refugees from the Jiangbei area. The office sent personnel to take care of them at the station and transport them to the shelters. However, at least half of these 500 people were not genuine flood disaster victims. Some were workers working in various factories in Shanghai, some were currently in their hometowns, and some were poor people who came to Shanghai to look for relatives and friends to make a living. All took this opportunity to mix with the disaster victims and take a free train to Shanghai, so it was not convenient to accommodate them all. However, it would not be appropriate to let them stay outside, in case they did not find their relatives and had nowhere to stay, turning them into refugees as well. The Fourth Office Affairs Meeting discussed this matter and decided to temporarily set up a temporary shelter in Zhabei. If any disaster victims arriving in Shanghai needed to find relatives and friends, the shelter would help them find and hand them over, so as to avoid them becoming vagrant. Those who had no relatives to turn to would be sent to the first shelter. In addition, many other important cases were discussed.</p>
<p>Fundraising for Clothing and Food: The shelter staff meeting decided that (1) regarding the disaster victims' clothing, it was decided to make 3,000 sets of single-layer clothing (it has been found that 1,000 sets have been made, and only 2,000 sets need to be made), costing more than 8 jiao per set, requiring about 3,000 yuan, and 3,000 sets of cotton clothing, costing 2.5 yuan per set, requiring about 7,500 yuan. One thousand five hundred quilts will be made first, costing about 5,000 to 6,000 yuan. In cold weather, straw mats will be laid on the lower bunks, with a single quilt on top, requiring a total of about 19,000 yuan. (2) Regarding the disaster victims' food, it was decided to purchase 100 shi of relatively coarse japonica rice and 500 bags of small ground rice. Japonica rice will be used to cook porridge, and small ground rice will be used to cook rice. Vegetables will be purely vegetarian, with vegetable oil added to make them delicious. (3) The office, noting that the disaster victims' children were malnourished, with yellow faces and weak bodies, decided to add soy milk, biscuits, and other foods every day to supplement their nutrition, which will be handled at the discretion of the hygiene team.</p>
<p>Financial Report: Feng Liutang, Director of General Affairs, reported on the financial situation, saying that on the income side, the municipal government allocated 50,000 yuan to the office, which has been fully received in installments, and donations from various sectors totaled 6,874 yuan, for a total of 56,874 yuan. On the expenditure side, the cost of provisions was 3,488 yuan 3 jiao 2 fen (in addition, the cost of food issued by the Tongren Fuyuan Hall was not included in the calculation), the construction cost of the first shelter was 3,293 yuan 3 jiao 6 fen (the total cost of the first shelter was 25,600 yuan, and only one batch has been allocated), and the emergency relief funds for the Yin Xing flood disaster was 1,300 yuan (this fund was approved by the Social Bureau to be allocated to the municipal commissioners of Yin Xing District for collection, and the Social Bureau has been replied to instructing the commissioners to prepare a roster of disaster victims so that they can be distributed to each household together), the clothing cost was 861 yuan 9 jiao, and the staff transportation cost was 284 yuan 7 jiao 4 fen (including 193 yuan for the food expenses of the police brigade). The remaining hygiene expenses were 392 yuan 2 jiao 9 fen, and the lecture and placement expenses were more than 1,500 yuan, for a total expenditure of more than 11,200 yuan. After offsetting income and expenses, there was still a surplus of more than 45,000 yuan, which was all deposited in the Shanghai Municipal Bank.</p>
<h3>Yesterday, More Cantonese Refugees Arrived in Hankou</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Guang Zhao Public Association and the Cantonese Merchants United Association previously sent personnel with funds to Hankou for urgent relief and to assist fellow villagers returning to Shanghai. The first group of 78 people arrived in Shanghai via the Huangpu Steamer and were received by the association, then dispatched back to their hometowns on the Suiyang and Guangdong steamers. Yesterday, the second group of 57 men and women arrived in Shanghai via the Wuchang Steamer. Upon arrival, they were taken care of by Mr. Chen Bingqian and other directors of the association and sent to the Mingli Inn and Guangtailai Hotel for accommodation. They are scheduled to be sent back to their hometowns on the Xinning Steamer on Saturday and Sunday.</p>
<h3>Relief Work by the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association</h3>
<p>Investigation of the Disaster in Wuhu: The disaster in Wuhu is worsening daily. In light of this, the association decided to send members Lu Bohong, Gu Jisheng, and Ning Songquan to Wuhu to investigate the disaster situation for reporting purposes. They departed yesterday. However, Mr. Lu Bohong was temporarily unable to go due to official duties and delegated Mr. Dong Junfu to represent him.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Donate Enthusiastically: Overseas Chinese, mindful of the floods in their motherland, have repeatedly donated generously. The association yesterday received two batches of donations totaling 20,000 yuan wired from the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce, and a fourth donation of 10,000 yuan from overseas Chinese in Honolulu to save the disaster victims. Their enthusiasm is commendable.</p>
<p>Donations from Various Public Organizations: (1) The association received a letter from the Shanghai Taixi Food Industry Association, stating that the floods are widespread and that they felt obligated to help. They have raised 7,180 yuan to be distributed in the disaster areas, along with 50 gallons of double knife brand disinfectant and five bags of red beans, totaling 500 pounds, for unified distribution in the disaster areas. (2) The Cotton Cloth Industry Association raised 2,300 yuan. (3) The Jinshan Private Mingqiang Elementary School raised a total of 315 yuan, including 45 yuan from the school's faculty and staff, 27.3 yuan from students, and 242.7 yuan raised from various sectors. (4) The Yuanyuan Shunji Silk Factory employees donated 101.2 yuan, small coins worth 71 cents, and 1,190 copper coins. (5) The Yuexing Sock Factory employees donated a total of 171.48 yuan. (6) The Jiangsu Automobile Company employees donated a total of 60 yuan.</p>
<p>Funeral Expenses Donated for Relief: The association received 1,000 yuan from the Wang Huai De Tang, which was Ms. Xie, the wife of Mr. Wang Huaisan's, dying wish to use her funeral expenses for urgent flood relief. Her words at the end of her life, turning love into action, are truly admirable.</p>
<p>Mr. Tang Lends a Calculating Machine: The association has been handling relief work for many years, being practical and realistic, and enjoying a well-established reputation. Mr. Tang En, representative of the Beilushi Calculating Machine Manufacturing General Factory in China, recognizing the association's recent busy work and the need for calculating machines to audit donations, specifically lent the association a calculating machine for its use.</p>
<p>Report from the Yangzhou Branch: The association received a report from the Yangzhou branch regarding its work, stating that the branch had requested Zhang Zhijiang's office to borrow a differential wheel, and on the 14th at 8:00 AM, four civilian boats loaded with 1,650 bags of flour and medicines and matches set off, first to Xuanling Town and then to the remote villages of Xinghua and Dongtai, to distribute flour. Winter clothing is still extremely needed, and the Shanghai association is requested to send it to Yangzhou as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Red Cross Relief Team Arrives in Town</h3>
<p>The joint relief team of the Chinese Red Cross and the Shibao Newspaper went to Jiangbei Yangzhou and Xinghua to relieve the victims. About 20 boxes of medicine, 4,000 bags of flour and 90,000 pounds of biscuits were carried. Qi Heqin, secretary of the Red Cross, Huang Lansun, a reporter of Shibao and others arrived in the town the day before. They contacted Yu Xiaochuan, Hu Jianchun, and the Shipping Association, and transferred two steamers and seven tugboats to distribute to the disaster area. The disaster victims gathered like ants so the procedure was in disorder. The county government's public security bureau was requested to line up the people and give them the permits and signatures in the name of the disaster victims. Fingerprints were also taken. Members of the party, government, commerce, learning and the public were invited to participate, so that there would be no duplication or omission.</p>
<h3>News from the Jiangsu Flood Relief Association</h3>
<p>Rescue in Baoying: Recently received a telegram from the Baoying Su Yi Association Office, Mr. Wang Huang Chengren, Chairman of the Renji Hall Su Yi Association, Baoying is in extreme plight and rescue workers are dispatched in all directions, carrying dry food, saving the hungry and drowning, and burying the dead bodies. The number of rescuers, including the previous report, reached more than 5,000 people. In addition to crossing to highlands and sending them off at any time, they are all ordered to be accommodated. They are still divided into rescue ways. In addition to the details reported separately, I would like to report to you first. Hui Ke Wei Koushan,</p>
<p>Relief in Gaoyou: According to a letter from Director Zhu, the disaster relief methods in Gaoyou are roughly divided into seven types: (1) Rescue, 2,596 Gaoyou refugees were rescued from the 5th to the 10th (the following imitation is not included before this), and 1,002 people were rescued from Jieshou. (2) 7,118 people were sent away. (3) A total of 12,535 people were successively accommodated. (4) There are three porridge factories in the city: Yongqing Temple, Chengtian Temple, and Tianwang Temple. Tens of thousands of people eat there every day. (5) 178 bodies were buried. (6) Anti-epidemic, clinics were established. (7) Livestock protection, livestock farms were established.</p>
<p>The Tragedy of Xinzhou: The disaster situation in Yongzhen Township, Yangzhou has been disclosed in newspapers. Now I have received a letter from Wang Mianzhi, a disaster victim in Xinzhou, (the above is omitted) Our place is in a flood waiting for rescue. I would like to present it to the elders. Please pray for pity and save it. On July 13, the early tide suddenly rose by four or five feet, and the wind and waves collapsed more than 50 houses in the Yongji Island and Tiancheng Island areas. All food, clothing, and belongings such as chickens and dogs were floating in the air. An old woman surnamed He and three children surnamed Chen drowned. At the same time, the western Jiang Tankou, Zhongxing Town Dawei and the eight people, Santang, Doubao, Jishan, Sixteen, and other ten or so weirs were broken and the sound of crying shook the sky. Fortunately, the evening tide was not large. Except for the Xijiang embankment and the two places in Bamin, there was no mud to block them. Autumn harvest is completely hopeless, hundreds of disaster victims are in the water every day, three or four feet deep and two or three feet shallow. All kinds of poisonous snakes, centipedes, come and go in the home, and live with people, waiting to be fed, with no food or clothing. Although we ask for help from all over, they are all neglected because the disaster area is small. Isn't it terrible? However, the disaster victims in Bizhou Weir have rice to salvage, and the disaster victims in Yongji Tiancheng and upland dry valleys are the hardest. Those with a little energy temporarily move to other places. Now there are more than 20 families left, including Mianzhi, who have no way to escape death. All the old and young people have no choice but to elect Mianzhi as their representative and go to Shanghai to plead with the folks and the great philanthropists of the time to give alms and save the dying and living dead fish. Gong Mo is also very big. (The following is omitted)</p>
<p>The Disaster Situation in Dangshan: Guo Jixin, chief of the Yangshan Farmers Association, sent a document as follows. The disaster situation is very serious, and the people cannot live. I hope that the council will grant relief funds to relieve the people and secure the local area. Because Dangyi has a poor geological quality, and is known as barren, in the old Xushu counties, it is known as the most bitter year-round soldiers and bandits, and famine is recommended. It has long been empty, and all opportunities for life have been exhausted. In the past few years, disasters have been reported one after another. Fortunately, at that time, various charities gave generously, allocated funds for relief, and saved countless lives. However, in the late summer and autumn of this year, the torrential rains lasted for more than two months, and the flood flooded the plain, four or five feet deep in some places and two or three feet shallow in others. In addition, Dangyi is humble, and the water in eastern Henan flows into the border, causing six or seven of the counties to become swamps. Early autumn harvest is only one or two, and late autumn is almost without seeds. What is the crime of the Dang people? I suffered this disaster. At the beginning of autumn, food prices skyrocketed. It is extremely difficult to buy food in towns and villages. It is true that the wheat harvest this year is not abundant, and even well-to-do families have no surplus grain. The poorest and poorest families buy grain to eat. Based on the harvest of wheat this year and the number of people in the county, if it is winter and spring, one-tenth of those who can eat again every day, two-tenths of those who can eat one meal, three-tenths of those who eat every other day, and the others who are displaced begging and waiting to die will be four or five-tenths. Quji will arrive next year in the wheat autumn, when there will be more than 300 days. If there is no relief policy, few orphans will be left. What is even more painful is that in the year of abundance, Dang people have meager income due to barren land, and by the time they are on holiday, they will have to support the old and carry the young and beg for food in Guanggu, Henan, Ying, Hao, Hao, Si, and other places in Anhui in order to survive. This year, all the above places have become disaster areas, and the Dang people have no place to find food and no way to live. If relief is not provided early, the weak will fill the trenches, the strong will take risks, and the future will be difficult to imagine. The association thinks about the situation, is heartbroken, and intends to ask Junhui to quickly allocate a huge amount of money to set up relief to save the people and secure the local area. I am very grateful and await orders. Presented to the Jiangsu Flood Relief Association,</p>
<h3>Anhui Relief Association Sends Personnel to Shanghai to Appeal</h3>
<p>Qiu Yuanwu, Standing Committee Member of the Anhui Provincial Relief Committee, came to Shanghai from Beijing the day before yesterday to appeal for the disaster situation in the province. Yesterday (17th), he met with Xu Shiying and Guan Jianfan, members of the Anhui Nationality of the Central Relief Committee and the National Flood Relief Association, and attended the Anhui Shanghai Fellow Flood Relief Tea Party to report on the actual situation of the floods in the province and jointly discuss relief methods. It is said that this time, 48 counties in Anhui were affected by the disaster, and the actual situation was even worse than that in Hubei and Jiangsu. However, due to lack of appeal, the outside world knows little about it. To this day, counties along the Yangtze River and the Huai River are still submerged in water. The entire county of Wuhe is submerged. There are floating corpses on the Jianghuai Water. There are still hundreds of corpses piled up on the mountains on the east and west sides of Liangshan, and they are allowed to rot and float. It is unbearable to see. According to reports, more than 8,000 people were drowned in Huoqiu County, including those with confirmed names. The collapse of Guangfeng Weir and the economic lifeline of Huaining counties have bankrupted tens of thousands of disaster victims, and they have gathered in the suburbs of the provincial capital. The weirs and fields in the entire province have been completely wiped out. The rest of the counties in Huizhou, although some have mountain fields, have also been washed away by mountain floods. The wheat season in northern Anhui has already been harvested, but it has also been washed away. In total, the disaster area in the province accounts for five-sixths of the entire territory, the disaster victims account for seven-eighths of the total number of people, and hundreds of thousands of people and animals have been drowned. The source of food production in the entire province has been cut off, and the disaster victims are crying for food day and night. A few days ago, disaster victims in various places along the Yangtze River were still climbing on the tops of houses and trees, desperately calling for help, but those who could not be rescued have been gradually starving to death and drifting away with the flow. It is heard every day that the existing disaster victims are waiting for rescue, and as a result, they are starving to death or throwing themselves into the water. The central government's emergency relief of 170,000 yuan has only been allocated to the ten counties with the most severe disasters, and it has not been able to reach them. In summary, it is also a drop in the bucket. At present, the disaster victims in the entire province can only wait to die. If there is no relief, the future will be terrible. It is also said that in the past, some charitable organizations or individuals generously donated relief, and most of them directly sent personnel or entrusted local individuals to handle the distribution, which caused great malpractices. The disaster victims hardly got any real benefits. First, there was no overall planning, and it was difficult to ensure that it was not biased and uneven. Second, they were full of food and drink. In the future, if there are fundraising relief funds in other places, it is best to entrust the provincial relief committee to take overall consideration and be responsible for it.</p>

<h3>The Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Board of Directors Decides on Interest Rate Guarantee Measures</h3>
<p>Funds Cannot Be Borrowed Without Completing the Procedures</p>
<p>Continued Meeting Scheduled for November 4th</p>
<p>The Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Board of Directors held meetings at the Bankers' Association for two consecutive days, which concluded the day before yesterday. According to a certain Chinese director who stayed in Shanghai speaking to this newspaper's reporter yesterday, the British refund of the Boxer Indemnity, including accumulated portions, is approximately 2.8 million gold pounds, all of which have been transferred to the London Purchasing Committee for safekeeping. According to the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Exchange of Notes, half is used for purchasing materials in England and half is used domestically. Two-thirds goes to the Ministry of Railways, and one-third is divided as follows: 40% for the Huai River dredging expenses, 20% for the Pearl River treatment expenses, 20% for the Yellow River treatment expenses, and the remaining 20% for construction projects under the Ministry of Industry. The main resolution passed at this Board of Directors meeting was to decide on the interest rate guarantee measures for the Boxer Indemnity so that the interest income is stable and can then be distributed to cultural and educational institutions. Therefore, from now on, all institutions borrowing funds must sign contracts in accordance with the interest rate guarantee measures and procedures resolved by the Board of Directors; otherwise, the funds cannot be paid. As for the 140,000 gold pounds in Huai River dredging expenses, it is the amount that the Huai River should receive and is not a special allocation. However, due to the severe floods and the urgency of the Huai River project, the Board of Directors will temporarily use it without having to pay it again in accordance with the interest rate guarantee measures. As for the flood relief case, the Chinese directors temporarily moved to request that some funds be allocated from the British Boxer Indemnity. After detailed discussions, it was determined that most of the British Boxer Indemnity is kept in the London Purchasing Committee, and the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Exchange of Notes was approved by the British Parliament and the uses have been designated. It would be difficult to change it now, so this case was not passed. The next meeting of the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Board of Directors is scheduled to be held in Beijing on November 4th.</p>
<h3>Eurasian Aviation Corporation Convenes Shareholders Meeting</h3>
<p>To Discuss Changing the Peiping-Manchouli Route</p>
<p>And Plans for the Northwest Route</p>
<p>The Eurasian Aviation Corporation has scheduled a shareholders meeting in Shanghai on the 28th of this month to discuss the development of the Northwest route and the reform of the Peiping-Manchouli route. The 8th Board of Directors meeting will be held on the same day to decide on the policy. Attendees at the Aviation East meeting include representatives from the Ministry of Transportation and representatives from the German Lufthansa Aviation Corporation. Attendees at the Board of Directors meeting include Chairman Wei Yifu, Vice Chairman Shuang Qing, Smidt, Director Liu Shufan, Li Jingcong, Lin Tianlan, Feng Yangke, Bolusen, etc. According to Sun Hegao, secretary of the Board of Directors, speaking to this newspaper's reporter yesterday, the Peiping-Manchouli route is now planned to be changed to Peiping to Taonan and then to Manchouli. The company sent aircraft and team leaders Smidt and Li Jingcong to inspect and test fly the route. Wireless equipment and various improvement equipment must be added along the way to ensure safety. After the two return, they will submit a report for the Board of Directors to review and handle. As for the two German pilots who were released from Outer Mongolia and returned to Peiping, the company has telegraphed them to rest in Peiping. The Northwest route is also being actively prepared. The route generally runs from Shanghai to Beijing, along the Longhai Line to Zhengzhou, then via Gansu, via Lanzhou and Dihua, and ends at Yili. It is more than twice as long as the Shanghai-Manchouli line, that is, about 5,000 miles long. Various plans will be discussed at this shareholders meeting and handed over to the Board of Directors for handling. It is expected that the route map will be surveyed and mapped and test flights will be prepared in a short period of time. New aircraft must also be purchased. After the Northwest route is opened, Eurasian mail can be smoothly delivered without being delayed by passing through Russia.</p>

<h3>Peace Relief Issue</h3>
<p>The Bankers' Association Discussed It Yesterday</p>
<p>The Result Was to First Telegraph Beiping to Inquire</p>
<p>The Shanghai Bankers' Association, for the purpose of promoting the issue of the Peace Relief Association, specially brought it up for discussion at yesterday morning's regular meeting. First, Mr. Lin Kanghou, a Standing Committee member of the Bankers' Association and initiator of the Relief Association, presented a telegram of support from Mr. Li Shizeng of Peiping, and a telegram from the Peace Relief Association initiated by all circles in Peiping a few days ago, advocating that in this autumn of major disasters, war should not be started again to cause misery to the people. All circles in the sea should jointly express their appeal for peace. However, empty words and indiscriminate telegrams may not help the facts. It is hoped that a good method can be found within the possible scope to seek salvation. The people present discussed it for a long time, and they all agreed that the desire for peace and disaster relief is shared by all Chinese people. However, the implementation plan must be carefully carried out in order to urge all parties to achieve effective results. As a result, it was resolved to first telegraph the Peiping Peace Relief Association to ask whether it has drafted a peace plan and to ask it to telegraph immediately so that all circles in the sea can proceed in an orderly manner and achieve the effect of unity between the north and the south.</p>
<h3>Soong Ching-ling Goes to Southeast Asia</h3>
<p>Hu Lanqi Sails to Germany Today</p>
<p>After Mrs. Sun Soong Ching-ling came to Shanghai for the funeral, she rested in her Shanghai residence and declared that she had never heard of the peace movement. Mrs. Sun has recently suffered from gastrointestinal problems, and doctors have suggested that she should go to Penang Island in Southeast Asia for medical treatment. Mrs. Sun followed the advice and left Shanghai on the 12th on the French mail ship Sphinx and went directly to Southeast Asia. She plans to rest in Penang for several months. After recovering her health, she will go to the United States for sightseeing. As for Ms. Hu Lanqi, a friend who came with Mrs. Sun, she is scheduled to sail today and continue her studies.</p>
<h3>Township Heads in the Second District of the County Oppose Re-Evaluation of Land Prices</h3>
<p>Peng Zhaotang Prepares a Document to Present to the County</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government recently found no funds for construction and party affairs, and planned to collect them from the field. The land price in the county was previously assessed at 100 yuan per mu. The current busy Cao and various other levies are already enough for 1%, and no more can be added. Therefore, a meeting was convened to re-evaluate the land price, which was set at 115 yuan per mu. The township heads in the second district of the county believed that land prices should not be increased at this time, so they proposed at the district affairs meeting that the original price should be maintained and requested that the district office forward it to the government. It is now heard that Peng Zhaotang, the head of the district, has prepared a document to present to the county to plead for the people.</p>
<h3>Chu Minyi's Thoughts on Investigating the Northwest</h3>
<p>Developing the Borderlands Focuses on Transportation</p>
<p>The Sino-French Northwest Inspection Team traveled to the Northwest for several months. Although there were no new scientific research data, there were indeed good thoughts on developing industries in the Northwest borderlands. According to Dr. Chu Minyi, head of the Chinese delegation of the Sino-French Northwest Inspection Team who has just returned to Shanghai, the Northwest, only Xinjiang Province, is 16 times larger than Zhejiang Province. The products are rich and the best in the country. Xinjiang Province is so large that not a single person has been seen lacking food and clothing. After returning to inland areas such as Jiangsu and Zhejiang, beggars were seen everywhere, and the state of poverty was far different from that of the Northwest. As for the development of the Northwest, I feel that the most important work is transportation. The inconvenience of transportation is a major obstacle. Now I feel that there are improvements that can be made to the original three routes to Xinjiang, that is, (1) from Guihua through the Inner Mongolia grasslands to the ancient city of Xinjiang Province. This route has no post stations and is relatively close, but it is more laborious to travel. If you use camels, it will take more than two months. If you use cars, it will only take more than 20 days. However, if you use cars, ordinary cars cannot bear this heavy task, because ordinary cars are very laborious in the desert. The creeping car that was tested this time must be very convenient, but it is too heavy. Therefore, I have planned to improve it according to the method of creeping cars so that it can be applied to this route and facilitate transportation. (2) From Peiping-Xi'an to Lanzhou, via Suzhou and Hami, to reach Dihua, there are a total of five sections on this route, 18 stations each. It usually takes more than 90 days to travel this route. If cars can also be used, it can be reached in 30 days. (3) For those going to southern Xinjiang, they must pass through Suzhou to Haas, which takes four months. In the future, if the transportation in the Northwest can be improved first, development will be easy. Then China's wealth and strength are promising. As for the detailed situation of the inspection of the Northwest, I will have a detailed report at the Central Memorial Week. Although Xinjiang Province is large, the people's races are also quite complex. The most famous are the four races: the Wrapped Head Hui, the Kazakh, the Mongolian, and the Old Jia. (i.e., the Tatar). The people mainly believe in Islam. The Russians have no power there. Because their purpose is opposed to communism, the Soviet Russian red propaganda is completely ineffective.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu Issues a Statement on Sino-Japanese Relations</h3>
<p>Denies Mobilization of Japanese Troops</p>
<p>Shanghai, 17th (Dentsu): Ambassador Shigemitsu issued the following statement on Sino-Japanese issues on the afternoon of the 17th. Recently, various unpleasant incidents have occurred between China and Japan, which have aroused public opinion in both countries, which is regrettable. The Nakamura incident is the most unfortunate of these. The Japanese government is seeking practical means to resolve the relations between the two countries in a friendly manner as soon as possible. Although the nature of the Nakamura incident is very serious and sad, it should not be difficult to resolve it quickly if appropriate solutions are sought for this incident alone. Regarding the Nakamura incident, there is a rumor that the Japanese army has a mobilization plan. This is completely groundless and is intended to be promoted.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Compatriot Association Asks the National Government to Pay Attention to the Xikang Problem</h3>
<p>The Sichuan Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai, considering the increasingly serious issue of Xikang (a region encompassing western Sichuan and eastern Tibet), telegraphed the National Government yesterday, stating: Urgent, To the Nanjing National Government: The Xikang region originally served as a shield for Sichuan Province. We, fearing for our own safety, must first prevent the fall of our neighbor. Recently, instigated by others, the Dalai Lama launched a major invasion of Kang. Although your government dispatched Tang Kesan to prevent it, the effort proved ineffective. Our association has recently received telegrams from various public organizations in Sichuan and Kang, reporting that Tibetan troops have not only failed to withdraw from Ganzi and Zhanhua but have also advanced to peek into Lihua, already occupying the two villages of Qiongxia, and have transported a large number of aircraft and cannons from India, posing a threat to the entire Kang region. According to reliable investigations, some people are commanding the Tibetan troops, and in Doron, under the jurisdiction of Degé, and Eyi Mountain, under the jurisdiction of Enda, which are occupied by the Tibetan army, British people are mining gold. As this concerns national defense and the well-being of Sichuan Province, our association cannot remain silent. We urge your government to immediately telegraph the Sichuan-Kang border defense forces to quickly increase troops to Kang to strengthen the border, and to protest to the British government, forbidding them from further unreasonable interference in Tibetan affairs, and to instruct the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission to formulate a plan for governing Tibet, to seek a fundamental solution, and not to continue procrastinating, thereby harming Kang and the country. The people of Sichuan have suffered greatly from war. Why does the central government leave the 300,000 Sichuan troops unused and listen to a mere Dalai Lama spreading false illusions? For the sake of resisting imperialism and supporting the weak, we hope that you will take action. This is what we expect. Respectfully, The Sichuan Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Beijing-Pingjin (Beijing-Tianjin) Line Officially Reopens Yesterday</h3>
<p>The China National Aviation Corporation's Beijing-Pingjin air route officially reopened yesterday morning. The Beijing-bound plane was originally scheduled to take off from Beijing Station at 8:00 AM yesterday, but it was delayed until 8:50 AM due to waiting for the Beijing-Shanghai night express train to load mail. It was then that pilot Chen Buzhou flew the No. 11 Xuzhou aircraft north to Pingjin Station. The southbound plane took off from Pingjin South at 8:00 AM in the morning, with pilot Zhang Huayi and aircraft No. 7. The Cangzhou plane arrived at Beijing Station at 3:40 PM yesterday. Each station along the line landed to unload mail according to schedule. Because the Tianjin station was still suffering from flood damage, the mail was transferred to Tianjin by the Pingpu train that day. Because yesterday was the first day of the Beijing-Pingjin resumption of flights, the amount of mail carried was very small.</p>
<h3>Chinese Business Electrical Workers Set to Petition Today</h3>
<p>But the trams still run as usual.</p>
<p>All workers of the Chinese Business Electrical Company are scheduled to hold a major petition today because the company has not fulfilled the terms of treatment. Tram operation and all departments work within the concession will be maintained as usual. The company has filed a report to the authorities for investigation. The Social Bureau sent personnel yesterday to investigate thoroughly, ordering them to wait quietly for a solution according to the law.</p>
<h3>Statement of Unemployed Workers of British Public Bus Company</h3>
<p>A General Meeting of the Committee to Demand Resumption of Work Was Established Yesterday</p>
<p>All the workers of the British Public Bus Company have been on strike for a month. In addition to appealing to the Social Bureau and the Municipal Party Headquarters for mediation, they specially established a general meeting of the Committee to Demand Resumption of Work yesterday, and issued a declaration, describing the process and requesting assistance from all workers and compatriots.</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Bureau commented, "Received with knowledge. It has been investigated that these workers did not follow the legal procedures when labor disputes first arose with the employer and before submitting conditions to the company, and requested assistance for review and handling, and even went on strike without authorization, relying solely on numbers to act recklessly, using the trick of affecting social transportation, losing the sympathy of the social public, and not knowing what the law is. It is obvious that they are being incited by others and have ulterior motives. Now that they have botched things up, they are gathering to petition in order to deceive. This bureau has already sent personnel to thoroughly investigate the facts. The previous actions of these workers have disregarded Party and government agencies from the beginning, and their request should be rejected. You should be informed of this order."</p>
<h3>Exhibits from Various Places Arrive in Shanghai for the Road Exhibition</h3>
<p>The establishment of the National Road Association began in 1921 (民十). At that time, there was only the Pacific Rim Road Association, in which Westerners accounted for the majority of members. Later, Chinese members believed that there was no need for others to handle Chinese roads on their behalf, and Chinese people should start by planning for themselves. Therefore, Wang Zhengting, Yu Qiaqing, Nie Yuntai, Chen Guangfu, and others came forward to organize the Chinese National Road Construction Association, and hired Wu Shanjun to lead the association's affairs. After ten years of arduous efforts, in order to promote nationwide road and city traffic and expand publicity, a road and city exhibition was specially held in the middle section of Avenue Petain (贝当路) in the French Concession of this city. Completed and uncompleted road maps and charts from all provinces and cities across the country, as well as various models of municipal construction, were collected, all with explanations and separately established. In addition, the most exquisite road and city exhibits from friendly nations such as England, the United States, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Cuba, and Finland were also added. Representatives from the governments of Henan, Tianjin, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces have been reporting their arrivals in recent days, all with detailed charts and various photos of roads and cities, sent to the association for establishment. Yesterday, the Japanese Consul General specially sent Mr. Iijima Masao to the exhibition site to report that the country's road and city exhibits, totaling more than 30 pieces, had been shipped to Shanghai and requested space. He will send staff and craftsmen to the venue tomorrow morning to renovate the exhibition hall site, and has been given entry badges by the site staff to allow them to transport them to the exhibition to learn from each other and facilitate progress.</p>
<h3>Annual Meeting of the Chinese Industrial and Commercial Management Association</h3>
<p>To Be Held Tomorrow at the United Association (聯華總會)</p>
<p>The annual meeting of the Chinese Industrial and Commercial Management Association of this city is scheduled to be held tomorrow at 2:00 PM at the United Association (聯華總會), No. 3 Beijing Road. The meeting will be chaired by the association's chairman, Minister Kong Yongzhi, to re-elect directors and discuss the association's work progress. The association has sent letters notifying all members to attend the meeting, and a 17th luncheon discussion meeting will be held at noon on the same day. Mr. Bourne, head of the Diplomatic Division of the International Labour Office, will give a speech entitled "Scientific Management and Labour Situation".</p>
<h3>Prevention of Cholera Report No. 8</h3>
<p>The National Maritime Quarantine Service issued Prevention of Cholera Report No. 8 yesterday, stating: (1) The cholera situation in the week from September 5 to 12 was roughly the same as the previous week. There were 30 cases of cholera in the Chinese area, with 2 deaths; 27 cases in the International Settlement, with 4 deaths; and 4 cases in the French Concession, with no deaths. In total, there were 61 cases and 6 deaths. From all aspects, the discovery of mild cholera cases seems to have reached its peak. We can expect it to gradually disappear in the near future. (2) On the 7th of this month, the quarantine medical officer at the Niuzhuang seaport discovered a 13-year-old child suffering from cholera on the "Taili" (Chinese) ship. This ship carried 97 passengers and 52 sailors and was departing from Tianjin. After all personnel on board underwent injections, the passengers were transferred to the Niuzhuang Seaport Quarantine Station. After five days of isolation, they were immediately released. It is strange that this child suffering from cholera came from Tianjin, as this disease has not occurred in that port. (3) News came from Wuhu that on the Wusong ship, which departed from Shanghai to Hankou on the 12th of this month, a cholera patient was discovered on the 14th of this month. Although it has not been confirmed as cholera by bacterial examination, the quarantine officer stationed in Hankou has, for the sake of prudence, administered injections to all passengers before they disembarked. (4) Millions of refugees from the disaster areas are still being transported to Shanghai. Special attention is being paid to their health before they leave Hankou and after they arrive in Shanghai. Quarantine officers board all ships arriving at the wharves to administer preventative injections to everyone and issue certificates. Those who are missed in Hankou are injected in Nanjing, and a final inspection and injection are carried out in Wusong. We are doing our best to reduce infectious diseases to a minimum and to prevent Shanghai from being infected. (5) Although the cholera epidemic in Shanghai is not serious, we still plan to administer preventive injections to those going to Hankou, Qingdao, Dalian, Japan, Hong Kong, and various ports in the south for the convenience of health officials in various places. The Japanese authorities have ordered that those traveling on Japanese ships must have their injections checked. If all on board have been injected, this measure seems unnecessary. (6) Along the Yangtze River ports, more people seem to be dying from dysentery and typhoid fever than from cholera. After cholera is brought under control, our second step will be to prevent dysentery and typhoid fever. (7) In Wusong, the injections for passengers going to Ningbo stopped on the 15th of this month. Since the work began on August 2, a total of 33,389 people have been injected.</p>
<h3>Record of People's Whereabouts</h3>
<p>Chen Shaokuan took the night express train to Beijing yesterday.</p>
<p>Song Ziwen, Cai Yuanpei, Yang Xingfu, and Zheng Hongnian left Beijing by night train yesterday and arrived in Shanghai this morning.</p>
<h3>Municipal Public Works Bureau Bans Vendors from Tapping into Shop Electricity</h3>
<p>1.  Must Report to the Company</p>
<p>2.  Must Modify Equipment</p>
<p>Many street vendors use electricity from nearby shops for business at night. The Municipal Public Works Bureau has not prohibited such actions, which violate the electricity company's regulations, out of consideration for the livelihoods of the vendors. However, it has been found that the electrical equipment used by these vendors is mostly decayed and unsafe, posing a risk of electric shock if not handled with care. For the sake of public safety, some restraint must be exercised. Therefore, four regulations have been stipulated: (1) Electricity users who supply electricity to vendors must first report the names of the vendors and the number of lamps used to the electricity company. Those who have already done so should make a supplementary report. (2) All electrical equipment connected to the vendors must use outdoor installation methods, capable of withstanding wind and rain. (3) The wires connected to the vendors must be at least 2.5 meters above the ground. (4) All existing electrical equipment of the vendors must be modified in accordance with the provisions of items (2) and (3) before November of this year. A fine of two yuan per lamp will be imposed for overdue modifications, and they will be ordered to make the modifications. Before being qualified, users must not allow them to use electricity. Otherwise, if found, the user's current will be cut off. It is reported that the order has been communicated to all electricity companies for notification and will be announced to all vendors and shops that provide electricity to vendors for compliance.</p>
<h3>Buddhist Pilgrimage Group Actively Prepares for Exhibition</h3>
<p>The leader of the Chinese Buddhist Pilgrimage Group, the monk Beiguan, previously returned to China from Siam to report the group's progress to the Chairman of the National Government. During his ten days in Beijing, he met with major figures such as Yu Youren, President of the Control Yuan, and Jiao Yitang, member of the Legislative Yuan, who all expressed their appreciation. Yu wrote the five characters "Buddhist Country Travelogue (佛國旅行記)" to be used as the cover of the commemorative publication for the exhibition opened by the Yousheng Travel Agency in this city for the group. Jiao also presented an inscription of seven characters "The Beginning of Buddhist Reform (佛教改革之發端)". Lin Jing, advisor to the Office of the President of the National Government, Ms. Liu Manqing, special envoy to Tibet, and Tan Yunshan, professor at the International University of India, also presented writings. Beiguan has completed his affairs in Beijing and returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday, and is currently staying at the Yousheng Travel Agency. It is reported that he is actively preparing for the exhibition.</p>
<h3>The Special Features of a Special Restaurant</h3>
<p>The Special Restaurant on North Sichuan Road (北四川路) and Old Baizi Road (老靶子路) was founded by Peng Peijun, who brought together a labor organization.

<h3>Baoyu Lane Tenants Oppose Rent Increase</h3>
<p>The tenants of Baoyu Lane (寳裕里), Caishi Street (菜市街), French Concession, opposed the landlord's desire to increase the rent again and held a general meeting of all tenants at 4:00 PM the day before yesterday (the 16th). All the tenants of the lane participated unanimously and publicly elected Mo Qichang as chairman. The meeting was conducted with due ceremony. The chairman first reported on the purpose of the meeting, stating that the rent for the lane was previously only 18 yuan per building. After the new houses were built, the rent suddenly increased to 60 yuan. At that time, the tenants appealed for a reduction, and the landlord promised not to increase the rent again. Only two years have passed, and now a notice has been suddenly issued that the rent for the lane will be uniformly increased by 30% from November 1. At a time when the provinces are reporting floods and the Shanghai commercial market is sluggish, our tenants are already worried about making ends meet with the current rent, how can they bear further burdens. It has been found that the landlord, Dehe Foreign Firm (德和洋行), has always been known for its benevolence and trustworthiness, but now it is increasing the rent by a huge 30% (i.e. 18 yuan), which is truly unbearable. With the date of the rent increase approaching in the blink of an eye, our tenants should jointly plan a countermeasure. It was decided to send a letter to the landlord, Dehe Foreign Firm, based on the above reasons and facts, requesting them to withdraw the order to increase the rent and to discuss further actions after receiving a reply.</p>

<h3>Mr. Someone's Inquiry</h3>
<p>I was about to graduate from a traditional middle school when, due to economic pressure, I dropped out midway. In recent years, I have been traveling around, holding a position in the political world. In reality, it was just mingling on the surface as a very minor official. Seeing the dignity and pompous airs of those "masters," it was truly unbearable. To put it impulsively, I should have packed my bags and left immediately. However, for the sake of eating, I had to suppress my temper and look up to others. I thought that if things continued like this, I would not get any material benefits, but I would feel very mentally distressed. Gentlemen, I am ashamed to say that I have no other skills besides holding a pen. Changing careers? Considering which job I could do, I pondered it over and over in my mind, unable to make a decision. Finally, with the partial understanding of my brother, I came up with a method: to raise some money, choose a place near the city, buy a few acres of garden land, build a few thatched houses, grow some vegetables and fruits, and raise chickens and ducks to live the life of a farmer. I would not be dependent on others, and I could endure the hardship. However, I am a complete layman when it comes to gardening. If I ask the gardeners for advice, they rely entirely on experience, which cannot be verbally transmitted. It seems that long-term practice is necessary. My current job cannot be left for a moment. If I quit it to practice planting, my whole family would starve. This is absolutely impossible. I wonder if there is any shortcut to learning. I feel that apart from such self-reliance, there is nothing else in the world that I can do. Is this ideal feasible after all? I sincerely seek your guidance.</p>
<p>(Reply) Mr. Someone, we admire your letter very much. Who else should lead a life other than one of self-reliance? Because you can still endure hardship, you want to be independent and think of gardening. We fully agree and hope that you make a resolution to follow this plan. The first step may be to investigate gardening books, first investigate the bibliography, then purchase them. Then, visit experts. We hope you do not underestimate the gardeners. Their experience is our most valuable teacher. At the same time, you must start a practical trial. However, it is best to delay leaving your current job. In case the initial trial fails, it will be even more difficult to make a living. You must be cautious about this point. Unfortunately, we do not know you in detail, and this is all we can offer. Please forgive us.</p>
<h3>Mr. Xin Sun's Inquiry</h3>
<p>I am a thirty-year-old young man, working in a small bank near Shanghai. I also bear the economic pressure in my family. However, my interests are not very close to commercial affairs, especially the banking industry. I have been forced to make do for ten years, and have suffered from severe neurasthenia. The doctor also said that I need to change my profession. Sir, based on my desires and symptoms, the only way is to leave my current job. But how can I solve the economic problem? What I like is a profession close to literature or a specialized field, with the possibility of continuous progress and research, such as a reporter, secretary, bookstore, or library staff. But how can I necessarily get it? I know that you can only give discussions and guidance on the issue, and cannot provide practical assistance universally. I hope you will publish this article for me, so that people know that a profession must be close to one's own talent and cannot be forced. On the one hand, I also hope that there will be people who sympathize with me and provide practical assistance!</p>
<p>(Reply) A profession must be close to one's talent. This is the principle of job selection. However, since you already have a job, you may as well pursue your favorite studies in your spare time (as you say, it is a literary kind of study). This is also a special way for those who have a job to study. Because there is a kind of thing that is close to talent that cannot be used as a profession, this can take care of both sides. It is not appropriate to leave your current job easily.</p>
<h3>Mr. Wang Boming's Inquiry</h3>
<p>Boming is only twenty-three years old this year, and has been teaching for a full seven years. In the middle, he has experienced all kinds of difficulties, tasted all kinds of hardships, and the situation has changed. It is hard to express in a word. First, he suffered the pain of dropping out of school, then he suffered from the torment of illness, and now he is suffering from the oppression of life. His mind and energy are exhausted. How can he make a living? I thought that when I was young, I had strong aspirations and never thought of working hard to make a difference, fulfilling the responsibility of a member of the nation, and seeking the happiness of a line in society. But when I was only nine years old, my kind father passed away, and my family had no wealth. I could not finish my studies. Thanks to my virtuous mother, who sold her hairpins to buy books. However, a child without a father is lonely and helpless. In important places of schools, there is no money and no one. After graduating from elementary school, middle school is as strict as a chasm. Although I have the ambition to reach high positions, I am ultimately reduced to dropping out of school. Whenever I see others carrying baskets and books, running around in Shanghai and Suzhou, walking with high spirits, I cannot help but cover my face and weep, and sigh that my fate is not as good as theirs. Alas, if I had more money, I would go from middle school to university, and even study in Europe and the United States, breathe new air, and study new sciences. Wouldn't it be as easy as turning my hand to become a master, doctor, engineer, senior professor, or university president? Why would I be so frustrated in the world, unable to make ends meet? Alas, now it is over. Since Ming dropped out of school, he was fortunate to have the help of his father's friend, who recommended him to a certain elementary school as an assistant teacher, earning sixty or seventy yuan a year. He dared not use it to provide for his parents, but only to make up for the lack of food and clothing. At that time, ashamed of his superficial knowledge, he recited and chanted from dawn to dusk, with a diligence hundreds of times greater than the students. As a result, his body underwent major changes, and his thin bones were fragmented and his arms could not be grasped. Although he has recovered and is as strong as ever, he is still trapped by his qualifications, barely passing every year. And the situation is unstable, the economy is difficult, and the teaching fees are owed for more than ten periods. Making a living is difficult, and living is difficult. My old mother is old, and my weak wife and young sisters, although they do not say they are crying from hunger and cold, are still wearing tattered clothes and eating coarse food. This is close enough. Is this the fate of my elementary school teacher? Why is it so difficult? If I do not find another way, can I still maintain family life in this troubled world? A crucian carp in the West River, a soul in a cauldron, is the future imaginable? Therefore, I sincerely ask the gentleman for help, or bestow valuable advice, so that it can be used as a compass. I am very grateful. I also hope to reply in the newspaper, then my colleagues in the elementary school world will be even more grateful. How can only those who have dropped out of school weep and thank you!</p>
<p>(Reply) Life is difficult, and all parties are the same. You only feel that masters, doctors, professors, etc. have high positions and a lot of money. As far as we know, they feel a lot of material pressure and mental pain. There are also many people who have big titles and are unemployed. The bigger the title, the more helpless. First, I advise you not to envy them. You have two advantages: (1) As you said, your fragmented and thin bones are now as strong as ever, which is a very gratifying thing. (2) You are fortunate to have a job, although the annual income is meager, it is better than nothing. You should strive to supplement your knowledge and skills in your spare time. If you can improve your knowledge and skills step by step, then the opportunities for excellence will be more and more every day. The more you feel the difficulty of life, the more you strive to improve your knowledge and skills. I don't know how many great educators, both Chinese and foreign, started as elementary school teachers. Please do not be discouraged. Changing careers is not a proper and not a stable way. I hope you think twice.</p>

<h3>Eight-Year-Old Boy Dies a Miserable Death, Bound with Stones and Sunk to the Bottom of the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>Not an Ordinary Kidnapping Case</p>
<p>A Scene of Murder for Money</p>
<p>Zhu Songlin Cannot Deny It</p>
<p>Yao Zhusheng Still Tries to Evade Responsibility</p>
<p>Yao Gu's eight-year-old son, Jiusheng, who lives at No. 199 Ma'an Lane, Chongqing Road, a widow living at her door, was playing at the entrance of his grandmother Gu Zhao's house at No. 96 Taiwei Lane, An'an Road, at 3:00 p.m. on July 7 this year, when he was suddenly abducted by bandits and disappeared without a trace. Later, because the ransom of 20,000 yuan was not successful, he was torn up and Jiusheng was thrown into the Huangpu River and buried in the belly of a fish. Jin Chunwu, the Chinese detective of the Jing'an Temple Police Station, etc., had arrested Zhu Songlin (i.e. Xu Miaogen), the principal offender in the case, a native of Pudong, the suspect, a Suzhou woman, Lu Wang, and the abettor, Yao Zhusheng (i.e. Zisheng, the head of the victim's clan), a local, and sent them to the First Special District Court for interrogation. The details of the case have been reported in this newspaper twice. Now, it is learned that according to the interrogation situation, this case is not an ordinary kidnapping case, but a case of murder for money in order to seize the family property.</p>
<p>The Truth About Jiusheng's Murder After the last court hearing was postponed, the Chinese and Western detectives repeatedly interrogated the captured Zhu Songlin in order to understand the truth. Zhu then confessed that Yao Jiusheng was actually killed by him. After Zhu met Yao Zhusheng, Yao entrusted Zhu to find a way to harm Yao Gu. Zhu then lured Jiusheng out and first hired a car from Dahua Motor Company at the intersection of Gordon Road and Avenue Haig, drove to Huishan Wharf, abandoned the car and boarded a sampan, ferrying to Sanlintang, Pudong, intending to temporarily lodge there. Later, Zhu was deeply afraid of being discovered by the local Public Security Bureau, and also afraid that Yao Jiusheng would reveal the truth, so he wanted to take Jiusheng back to Shanghai. At this time, Zhu suddenly had the intention of murdering. He found a large stone, a hemp rope, and hired a sampan again, drove to the center of the river, tied the large stone to one end of the rope, and tied the other end to Jiusheng's body, pushing him into the river, causing him to sink to the bottom of the Huangpu River. The corpse could not be salvaged. At that time, Zhu took out one yuan from his side and gave it to the boatman, telling him not to publicize it. He took off a pair of shoes that Jiusheng was wearing in advance as a proof for the future ransom. Then he returned to Shanghai alone. Later, because the ransom was not successful, he threw the shoes in the alley outside No. 257 Chongqing Road. The Chinese and Western detectives obtained the confession, and then supervised Zhu Songlin to go together and found a pair of shoes.</p>
<p>Statement by the Police Lawyer Yesterday afternoon, the date for the continued hearing of the case arrived. Around 2:00, Yao's family's male and female relatives and neighbors all came to the Second Criminal Court of the Special Court to listen, about hundreds of people, causing the court to be full and crowded. Yao Jiusheng's biological mother, Yao Gu, sat silently in the audience, her eyebrows locked in spring mountains, crying non-stop. At 2:30, Judge Wu Tingqi took the seat, first interrogating a misappropriation case. When the interrogation involved this case, it was already after 4:00. The defendant Yao Zhusheng hired two lawyers, Tao Wuzhi and Yu Hualong. Lu Wang hired Wang Liangqing as a lawyer to defend him. Only Zhu Songlin had no lawyer to represent him. First, the police lawyer Wang Yaotang stood up and stated the details of the case in detail, saying that after Yao Jiusheng was abducted, his family posted advertisements to look for him, initially offering a reward of 100 yuan, and later increasing it to 500 yuan. A total of 15 letters of extortion were received from the bandits. Yao Gu had paid the bandits 20 yuan. However, regarding the second defendant, Lu Wang, according to Zhu Songlin's confession, she had nothing to do with this case, and was actually framed on purpose. Therefore, he asked to be sentenced first, so as to avoid detention of the innocent. Now there are witnesses in the case, please interrogate them, and then present the letters and shoes for inspection.</p>
<p>The Accent of a Pudong Person According to Gu Quansheng, a driver of Dahua Motor Company, on July 7, at more than 2:00 p.m., the defendant Zhu Songlin brought a woman and a boy about seven or eight years old to hire a car. I drove car No. 17555, first saying that the fare to the Bund was one yuan, and then suddenly wanted to go to Huishan Wharf. The car arrived at Tilanqiao, and Zhu et al. got off, giving me one and a half yuan for the fare and half a yuan for the wine money. At that time, Zhu personally wrote one yuan and five cents on the signature paper, and then presented the signature paper to the case. But the so-called woman is not the defendant Lu Wang, etc. According to Gu Peiheng, he is an assistant at lawyer Jiang Jishi's office. Yao Gu is my sister. After my nephew Jiusheng was abducted, he first received two letters, demanding a ransom of 20,000 yuan. Later, he suddenly received a phone call from the bandits, which I answered. He asked me if I had received the letter and what to do now. I replied that the letter had been received and would be implemented according to the letter. However, I observed that his accent was very similar to that of the former tenant, Zhu Songlin. Because I live at No. 96 Taiwei Lane, An'an Road, Zhu came to rent my house in March this year and lived there for more than a month before moving elsewhere. He is a native of Pudong, so his accent is very easy to distinguish, etc.</p>
<p>Zhu Songlin's Confession According to the woman Xu Zhang, Zhu Songlin is my husband. He also has a concubine named Zhou Juxian. Since Zhu took a concubine, I have disagreed with him and separated. I have also heard Juxian and Zhu Songlin talk about Yao Jiusheng being killed by her husband. However, I do not know how he was murdered. It has been found that Zhu Songlin's real name is Xu Miaogen. Because he was raised in the Zhu family, he changed his name. Questioning Zhu Songlin confessed that in 1927, I had a dispute with my friend Zhang Shaorong in Hankou over opium, and Zhang and Lu Wang's husband, Lu Rensheng, embezzled 1,000 yuan from me. Therefore, I filed a lawsuit in the Xiaokou Court. I was detained for three years, and then released to Shanghai. This case has nothing to do with Lu Wang. It was because her husband embezzled my money that she framed me. As for Yao Zhusheng, I met him in Hankou before. At that time, Yao opened a small You Tiantian restaurant. I have no grudges with him. On February 29 this year, I came to Shanghai from Pudong and met Yao at the entrance of Baoyu Lane. Seeing that my clothes were ragged, he gave me two yuan and made an appointment to meet at a Yile Tian teahouse. He then entrusted me to find a way to seduce Yao Gu and give me 120 yuan. Later, because I saw that Yao was gentle and kind-hearted, I could not bear to harm her. However, Yao Zhusheng repeatedly discussed it, saying that since the seduction was a failure, it would be better to lure away her son. I followed him, lured Jiusheng out. That night, because I could not meet Yao, I took Jiusheng to Pudong. He accidentally fell into the Huangpu River. I really did not use large stones and ropes to tie him to Jiusheng's body to murder him. I got a total of 220 yuan from Yao Zhusheng, etc.</p>
<p>The Case Was Postponed for Another Hearing The rest of the confessions were the same as the last time and have been reported in the newspaper, so they are omitted.

There were also two letters that were written by a fortune-telling stall in Hankou on his behalf. Lu Wang denied the accusations, and Yao Zhusheng still confessed that he was framed by Zhu. Judge Wu said that it was late, and ordered that the case be postponed to October 1 at 2:00 p.m. for another hearing. Lu Wang was released on bail, and Zhu and Yao were returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Two Kidnappers in the Wang Zenshi Case Executed by Firing Squad</h3>
<p>Chen Xinggen, 32, a kidnapper from Shanghai, and He Yuren, 28, from Muxian, were arrested by the French Police for jointly forming a gang to kidnap Wang Zhenshi, the young owner of Wang Yutai Tea Shop, with weapons, and were sent to the French Concession Public Concession, where they were sentenced separately. Lu Liankui, the Chinese Chief Inspector of the Public Concession Police, found that Chen and He had committed two cases of kidnapping Lin Weiqing, the elder brother of Lin Biao, the President of the Jiangsu High Court, and Chen Mingsheng, the compradore of Merril and Co., and extorting ransoms in the Public Concession. Therefore, he brought the two criminals for trial at the First Special Court and confirmed that they were true. Chen and He were sentenced to death and submitted to the Provincial Government for approval. Yesterday afternoon was the date of execution. Judge Cheng Shangfeng opened the court and ordered the two criminals to be brought to the case, asking if they had any last words. Chen Xinggen requested to send a letter to No. 10 Tongzhou Road, ordering his mother to collect the body. He said he had no words. Judge Cheng then allocated two yuan to the two criminals to buy food and drink, and then the police escorted them to the Caohejing execution ground by car, where the police executed them by firing squad.</p>
<h3>Hand Grenades and Steel Pipes Seized</h3>
<p>Whether They Were Commissioned by the Jinling Manufacturing Plant</p>
<p>Must Be Investigated Before a Decision Can Be Made</p>
<p>At about 1:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, the Harbin Police Station received a report from Ren Runsen, a representative of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and Wu Pu, a representative of the Municipal Party Department, saying that Chen Xunzhi, a Guangdong native living at No. 627 Yuanhe Lane, Wuzhou Road, was a reactionary element and privately hid military supplies, etc., and requested cooperation in the arrest. The head of the police then sent the Chinese detective Hou Fulin and the Western detective MacLellan to go to the address to arrest Chen. After searching, nothing was found. After questioning, it was learned that he was an accountant at Yongguang Electric Manufacturing Factory at No. 362 on the same road. They went to the factory and found a lot of small white steel pipes (about two inches long) needed for military supplies, which were parts of the hand grenade. They were taken into custody by the detectives, and Chen was taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court. According to the police lawyer Zhang Tianyin's statement of the case, it was stated that the investigation revealed that Yongguang Electric Manufacturing Factory had a contract with the capital Jinling Arsenal to manufacture this item, and it was not privately made. Moreover, a foreman surnamed Shen in the factory had previously been detained for stealing models and sent to the Simple Court of Justice. Although he was declared innocent, there was also a case to be checked. The police must have conclusive evidence to present that this item was supplied to which party. If this kind of supplies should not be manufactured in the concession, the police may prosecute the court. They also presented the white steel pipe for inspection. Then Ren Runsen, a representative of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, reported the matter again and requested a transfer. Wu Pu, a representative of the Municipal Party Department, also stated that the factory's main gate was closed all day, and the staff and workers all entered and exited from the back door, so there was a suspicion of reactionary work. He also described various suspicions. When questioned by the defendant, he confessed that he was an accountant in the factory. The manager's surname was Li, and he was not currently in Shanghai. This kind of white steel pipe was indeed made by the Jinling Arsenal according to the contract. He will present the case. Li Junyou, a native of Ningbo, testified that he opened the Yida Hardware Store at No. 103 Broadway and was also a shareholder of the factory. Since the central government was established in the capital, he had contacted the Jinling Arsenal to contract to manufacture the white steel pipe and steel needle cover, etc., which were parts of the hand grenade. A lot was manufactured every month. The small steel pipes stored in the factory were all returned because the previous sizes did not match. The front door of the factory was always closed because the engineer Shi Yunshi had taken the models privately and a dispute occurred, so it was closed. He also stated that the defendant was not a reactionary element and asked the court to be clear. After Judge Shen Bingrong checked the confessions, he ordered the Municipal Party Department representative Wu Pu to quickly send a telegram to the Jinling Arsenal to reply. He then ordered that the case be investigated and handled after the Public Security Bureau presented conclusive evidence. The hearing was postponed, and the defendant was returned to custody.</p>

<h3>Record of the Zhu Yanqing Kidnapping Trial</h3>
<p>Zhu Yanqing, aged 27, son of Zhu Baoyuan, the owner of Zhenhe Tea Shop at No. 127 Dean Lane, Pentang Lane, North Shanxi Road, Public Concession, Zhejiang Haining native, was kidnapped on the 8th of this month at 11:00 PM.  He was taking a chartered car from the tea shop back to his residence at No. 94 Zhaofang Lane, behind the Republican Theater on Fangbanqiao in the Chinese area. While passing in front of Bu Lin Li at the intersection of Zhengjia Muqiao Street and Minguo Road in the French Concession, he was abducted by bandits and hidden in the attic room of No. 73 Jianye Li, Fulv Li Road.  They intended to extort a large sum from his family for his release. However, the case was discovered by Jin Jiulin, Detective Inspector of the Special Agency of the French Police, along with detectives Li Yaolong, Tang Yunqing, deputy detectives Qian Yumin, Mao Jinge, Lü Zhulin, Zhang Ziying, etc. On the morning of the day before yesterday at 10:30 AM, they led a team of detectives and rushed to the location, rescuing the hostage and arresting twelve male and female kidnappers from Tongzhou: Zheng A'er, Yu Aqing, Tang Afu, Cao Zhangshi, Qian Taoyuan, Hong A'gen, Lu Yisheng, Wang Ziqing, Wang Jiangshi, Qian Liushi, Liu Shaoqing, and Qian Wangshi. They confiscated two loaded handguns, fourteen lead bullets, one iron chain, and one pair of black-rimmed tortoiseshell glasses with white lenses. They were taken into custody for interrogation, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday, the police summoned the victim Zhu Yanqing, and witnesses Gao Zhensheng and Chen Jinfu to the court. The defendants were sent to the Second Special District Court, where Judge Luo Renji and Prosecutor Ding Shikui presided over the criminal court for questioning. First, Gu Shouxi, the police lawyer, explained the case, stating that the defendants had kidnapped Zhu Yanqing by first renting a car and driving it to a remote place, where they forced the driver out and tied him up before kidnapping the hostage. This case was serious, and the police investigation was not yet complete. He requested a postponement of three weeks for a detailed investigation. Detectives Mao Jingen and Lü Zhulin, who were handling the case, reported the circumstances of the breakthrough. They stated that the case began with defendants Wang Ziqing and Wang Jiangshi renting a car, driving it to an open area, and forcing the driver out, tying him to the ground.  Then, they went to Zhengjia Muqiao Street to kidnap Zhu Yanqing. After the incident, the Western Detective Chief ordered a strict investigation. At 10:30 AM yesterday, they first arrested the first defendant, Zheng A'er, at No. 13 Jianye Li. When asked about the location of the hostage, he said it was at No. 73. They went upstairs to No. 73 and saw the second, third, fourth, and fifth defendants sitting at the entrance of the attic, looking frightened. When they pushed open the attic door, they saw that the doors and windows were covered with curtains. The victim, Zhu Yanqing, immediately said, "I am the god of wealth, don't shoot!" and was rescued, and the defendants were arrested.  Handguns, iron chains, glasses, etc. were confiscated. According to the defendants, the mastermind of the case was Lu Yisheng, the victim's former chauffeur of three years. He was arrested at Huili in Simalu. Detectives were sent to guard the bandits' den, and three more people arrived and were arrested. The confiscated handguns, etc. were presented as evidence. The victim, Zhu Yanqing, stated that he was taking a chartered car at night and, while passing in front of Bu Lin Li at the intersection of Zhengjia Muqiao Street and Minguo Road, where the houses were recessed, he was suddenly surrounded by bandits who showed him handguns. At first, he mistakenly thought it was a police checkpoint, but when the chartered car was overturned and he fell out, he was kidnapped and put into a car. There were people watching him on both sides. The car went west along Minguo Road to Milu Road, then from Nanyang Bridge to Tangjiawan on Lanwei'ai Road, and then from Father Lao's Road, passing Fa Park to the intersection of Qiqi Road and Fulv Li Road, where he got out of the car. He walked into Jianye Li, first to No. 13, and then, after about ten minutes, to No. 73, where he was locked up in the attic until the detectives came to rescue him. He often saw the second, third, and fourth defendants guarding him in shifts. The witness Gao Zhensheng stated that he was a driver at Yun'an Motor Company on North Sichuan Road. On the evening of the 8th at 7:55 PM, two people, a man and a woman, came to rent a car. After an agreement was made, the accounting department ordered me to drive. They said they were going to the 16th pier and then to Avenue Albert. First, we went to the 16th pier and stopped for ten minutes, then to Avenue Albert. After about ten minutes, two people came up and forced me out and tied me up. They drove the car away. The witness Chen Jinfu testified that he drove the chartered car for the victim's family. After the owner was kidnapped, I reported to the police. After hearing this, the official asked each defendant their name, age, address, and origin, and then ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody, pending further trial on October 8.</p>
<h3>Zhao Ji Rubber Tube Factory's Lawsuit with Lihe Over Machine Purchase</h3>
<p>Machines Purchased That Cannot Operate</p>
<p>Lihe Blames the Workers</p>
<p>Zhao Ji Rubber Tube Factory at No. 71 Haifang Road, in September 1929, ordered rubber tube manufacturing machines from Lihe Foreign Firm on Sichuan Road, with a price of 1,916 British gold pounds. These machines were used to manufacture lead tubes for toothpaste or paint. At the time of ordering, both parties agreed that the machines could produce 15,000 tubes every eight hours and would be delivered within four months.  The seller guaranteed that the machines were of the best quality and that their engineers would provide installation instructions. Any disputes should be settled by arbitration, without recourse to the courts. After the machines arrived and were installed, it was discovered that they could not operate. The seller successively sent five engineers to test them, but to no avail. The buyer then stopped paying the installments. When the dispute arose, the seller invited Mr. Kabang, an engineer from Kongshi Foreign Firm, and the buyer invited Mr. Laolai from Jiayang Foreign Firm, to consider and study the situation. In May of this year, Mr. Kabang suddenly withdrew from arbitration duties, and Mr. Laolai ruled that all the machines should be returned to Lihe Foreign Firm, and that the price paid by the buyer should be returned along with compensation for various losses. At this time, Lihe Foreign Firm also filed a lawsuit in the First Special District Court against Shen Zhaoji for failing to pay for the goods. The lawsuit stated that the defendant did not hire skilled workers. After the machine was installed, it was damaged due to the misuse of equipment by unskilled workers, making it difficult to operate. Therefore, the plaintiff was no longer responsible. However, they repeatedly assisted in repairing the machine. The defendant insisted on submitting the matter to arbitration, making it impossible to repair the machine properly. The defendant's arbitrator, on the pretext of the plaintiff's delay in arbitration, suddenly announced that they intended to make a unilateral decision in accordance with English law. Because of the defendant's arbitrator's attitude, arbitration could not proceed. Therefore, they requested the court to make a decision and order the defendant to pay 1,916 British gold pounds, minus the deposit of 3,880 taels that had already been paid. The initial hearing was held on July 6. After both parties presented their case, the plaintiff stated that they would invite a German specialized engineer to Shanghai to install the machines. Today, the engineer has arrived in Shanghai, and Shen Zhaoji is also planning to go to the United States to order other machines. Therefore, Shen's proxy lawyers Ge Zhaoji and Chen Tingrui, and the plaintiff's proxy lawyers Mu Ansu, etc., jointly agreed in the Tenth Court of the Special District Court that the factory would connect to electricity from the power company immediately and test the machines for three days to determine their quality.</p>
<h3>Impersonating an Anti-Japanese Association Inspector to Extort Money from a Southern Goods Store</h3>
<p>Sentenced to Six Months Imprisonment</p>
<p>At 4:30 PM the day before yesterday, a young man in a Zhongshan suit suddenly arrived at F康東 (Fu Kang Dong) Southern Goods Store, located at No. 502, half address, Aierjin Road, and asked for Manager Wang. The owner, Fang Yongnian, received him and inquired about his intentions. He claimed to be Chen Rui, from Jiading, and an inspector for the Anti-Japanese Association. He said that according to a secret report from Pan Yuezhang, who recently left the store, the store was secretly importing a large quantity of Japanese goods, which was inappropriate. He requested that a responsible person be sent to the Anti-Japanese Association to resolve the matter, or that fifty Buddhist statues could be offered as a congratulatory gift for a private settlement. Otherwise, there would be unfavorable consequences. Fang Yongnian, upon hearing this, realized that he was a swindler impersonating someone to extort money. He sent Manager Wu Quangen to feign compliance while personally reporting to the local Huisi police station. The police chief ordered Chinese and foreign detectives to investigate. Just as they arrived at the entrance of the F康 (Fu Kang) store, Wu Quangen had already handed over forty silver dollars to Chen, who took the money and left the store. He was immediately arrested by the detectives, who found the stolen goods and took him to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court, where police lawyer Wang Yaotang presented the case, stating that he was being prosecuted for fraud under Article 370 of the Criminal Code and requested a judgment according to the law. Fang Yongnian and witness Wu Quangen also testified about the events. The defendant Chen Rui claimed that he used to be a teacher. A friend, Pan Yuezhang, had reported to him that the F康 (Fu Kang) Southern Goods Store had recently purchased a large quantity of Japanese goods from Dongtai 洋行 (Yang Hang) in 中虹橋 (Zhong Hongqiao), such as 500 boxes of abalone, 2,500 bags of sugar, and 20 boxes of 味之素 (Ajinomoto), etc. He went to F康 (Fu Kang) yesterday to ask Manager Wang not to import Japanese goods in the future and did not intend to extort money. Judge Feng Shide reviewed the testimony and sentenced Chen Rui to six months of imprisonment for using fraudulent means to obtain money, and the number of days of detention before the judgment was confirmed would be deducted from the imprisonment at a rate of two days for one day. The forty silver dollars were returned to the victim.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau Arrests Robbers</h3>
<p>Shen Wenda, a detective from the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, learned that Shen Amao and others, the robbers in the case of the Ding family robbery in the Nanyang Jingqiao area under the jurisdiction of the Second Branch of the Third District of Pudong on July 8 of this year, were now hiding in the Dingjiazhai area of nearby Yangjing Town. They sometimes went to the Longquan Teahouse in the town for tea, usually around 8:00 AM every day. He immediately reported this to the captain and requested a quick arrest. The captain, Lu Ying, dispatched detectives Ling Tianpeng, Li Xiaobao, Chen Liangfu, Zhou Peisan, secret agent Li Jinbao, etc., along with informants, and worked with the police chief of the jurisdiction to wait in ambush. They waited until about 9:00 AM yesterday morning, when they saw Shen, the suspect, sitting in the teahouse, chatting and drinking tea. The detectives immediately stepped forward to arrest him and took him back to the team for preliminary interrogation. The suspect confessed directly that in early July, he had conspired with Yang Shaoting, Zhang Zhenfa, and two others to rob the Ding Musheng family in Nanyang Jingqiao with handguns and had spent the stolen money. Furthermore, at 7:00 AM yesterday morning, they arrested Zhang Genfa, another suspect, at No. 1 Zhangjiawan, Pudong, and brought him back to the team for questioning. Zhang also confessed directly. After Lu, the captain, obtained the confession, he immediately prepared a document to be sent to the Judicial Section for further interrogation.</p>

<h3>Juan's Sorrow</h3>
<p>— Zheng Hong</p>
<p>Juan's sorrow is increasing day by day. She has lost her parents. She has lost her hometown. Her hometown is 江北 (Jiangbei), which has now been ravaged by floods. Besides her parents, her family only consists of two younger brothers, who all live in 江北 (Jiangbei). They have some land and can live comfortably. When she received the news of the flood disaster in her hometown, she was very panicked. However, amidst the panic, there was a kind of inexplicable joy. She thought that no matter how much was lost, her parents would be safe and sound. Perhaps they would come to Shanghai safely, and she could be reunited with them. She waited and waited, but later she gradually became disappointed. Not only was there no trace of her parents, but she also had no way of knowing any news about them. There was no acquaintance she could ask, no newspaper she could get any clues from. She, who had been very calm, became distraught. She was flustered and uneasy all day long. But what was the use of this? Her parents were still nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>Every day when the first batch of letters arrived, she was always excited. She would rush out to see if there was a letter for her. After other students excitedly took their letters back, she would slowly walk back empty-handed, dejected and exhausted, as if she had run a long distance. She looked very painful, but she tried her best to control herself and勉强 (reluctantly) said, "There is still no letter from home today. It must be all over." At the same time, as usual, a student would say, "Don't worry. They must have arrived at some safe place early. In the chaos, people often forget everything. It's understandable that they didn't think of writing to you." She would listen to these kinds of words and temporarily treat them as a kind of pointless consolation. However, what comfort did this really give her? The most painful thing in the world is to be in a state of uncertainty.</p>
<p>Her anxiety and irritability gradually disappeared. She became calm, and it was a calmness she had never had before. Often in class, she would sit absentmindedly, with her eyes slightly closed. It looked like she was thinking about her parents. She was thinking about her hometown. We can imagine that she was thinking about how the water flowed everywhere in her hometown, how the water submerged the ripe fields, how the water washed away everything. All of this was what she loved and what she was familiar with. She would also tilt her head from time to time, listening as if she could hear the sound of water. Finally, she saw the tragic situation of her parents. How they climbed onto the roof, crawling and stumbling. How they cried out to the white expanse of water, but there was no rescue. Finally, how hunger and terror forced them. Some were exhausted and dizzy, falling into the water. The others also screamed tragically and jumped down together... She silently, with her eyes closed, shed tears. She didn't even know it until the teacher's occasionally raised voice startled her awake. Then she quickly wiped away her tears and quickly wiped away the teardrops on the book in front of her. She was secretly grieved, but what was the use of this? Her parents were still nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>Last autumn, he came to see his daughter. He was a middle-aged villager with a slightly bald head, wrinkled forehead, sincere smile, and a short, stubby beard. Every move he made showed his sincerity and simplicity. Although he was wearing a silk shirt, the silk shirt was not very suitable for that season, and he also seemed not very used to wearing it. Obviously, he cherished this silk shirt and wore it specially, so as not to wear simple cloth clothes and make his daughter lose face. He sat politely in the reception room, looking at his daughter and chatting about trivial things. Finally, he talked about the bag of raw pearl rice he had brought, saying, "This is what you like to eat. This pearl rice can be cooked in a small pot on a 洋磁風爐 (foreign porcelain stove). There's enough for about five pots. If you want more soup, you can cook it six times... You can share it with your classmates. Are they still good to you?" As he spoke, he carefully took out a bag of sugar. "This is sugar. Don't put too much when you cook it. It's not good if it's too sweet... Be careful not to burn it." This bag of sugar was not what he had brought from the countryside. He had specially bought it after arriving in Shanghai. Later, we saw that it was a bag of high-quality fine white sugar. He wanted to make sure his daughter ate something exquisite. Later, when he was about to leave, as he walked out of the reception room, a breeze blew on his daughter's clothes. He unconsciously pinched her arm and said, "You must wear warmer clothes. Why are the sleeves so short? They must be longer." Unexpectedly, this unconscious pinch caused a classmate who was secretly eavesdropping outside to laugh. He immediately realized it, and his sincere face suddenly turned red. He felt very embarrassed. He felt that he had made a rude gesture, something that only farmers in the fields would do. He carefully looked at his daughter, wondering if she would laugh at him or be embarrassed. Seeing that his daughter was calm and happy, and didn't care at all, he was relieved and left. This deep love deeply moved us, let alone his daughter.</p>
<p>We feel perplexed. How could such a loving parent not give their daughter any news, even in difficult and chaotic times? But where are they after all?</p>
<h3>Humor</h3>
<p>— Yan Na</p>
<p>Filled with a strong desire for knowledge, I traveled across the ocean from the coastal city of Jia in South China to Shanghai, entering a Western school by the side of the Rihui Harbor. I deeply love nature. The morning and evening sun over the sea and sky, the flying wisps of the waves, the floating seagulls on the waves, and the lone herons in the moonlight are all objects of appreciation. I wish I could embrace them forever and never leave them. I am honored to be listed among the "talents" of the Western school. The first pleasant thing is the natural environment of the Western school, because although it cannot compare to Jia City, it has a different flavor. In front of the school building is a green lawn, and a little further away is a bay of flowing water. Red and purple wildflowers adorn the grassland. The sparse willow forest in the garden constantly emits delicate bird sounds. The spring breeze caresses the face, making people feel intoxicated. I thought to myself, I hope the education of the Western school is as satisfactory as the natural environment. That would fit the old saying, "The spring breeze cultivates people."</p>
<p>The principal is an old celebrity from Jia City, in his forties, with a tall figure and a refined demeanor, naturally possessing the "style" of a celebrity. He is good at writing regulated verse, loves wine, and usually does not attend school board meetings much. He especially detests anniversary weeks because he has to give political reports. Such are the characteristics of a celebrity.</p>
<p>The many faculty and staff hired by the celebrity all have their own expertise. Some are good at coping, and some are good at flattering.</p>
<p>Discussing faculty and staff after class is a common trait of students. Our classmates have always had a harmonious relationship, and when we talk, we are unconstrained by ancient or modern times. One day in May, the weather was clear and bright, a Saturday. After class in the afternoon, we invited many classmates to a mountain in front of the school -- Shanghai has no highlands, clearly just a mound, but stubbornly called it a mountain -- and chose a soft patch of green grass to sit down. We watched the sails on the river, weaving back and forth like a loom. At the junction of the water and sky, a flock of waterbirds scattered and reassembled, soaring in the setting sun. A slight breeze swept over the grass, blowing up waves of wrinkles. The faint sound of a bell broke the silence of the empty sky. Everyone sat in silence for a while. A certain gentleman who loved sports picked up a white stone from the grass, jumped up, and vigorously threw it towards the Western school, shouting, "I want to smash that factory that makes 'manure machines' with one stone!" The stone clanged and landed on a large rock on the hillside. Everyone knew that in his silence, he had thought of the Western school, thought of its chaotic and lifeless way of running the school, and even thought of its celebrity principal, who appeared and disappeared like a divine dragon. Each person's heart burned with intense anger.</p>
<p>Zi Jun, one of the companions, was known for his "humor." His sandalwood-colored face, paired with a pair of bright eyes like copper nails, even when he was silent, had a bit of a funny look. He lowered his head, almost inserting it between his knees. For a long time, he seemed excited. He raised his head, pouted his lips, paused for a while, then bit his lower lip under his upper teeth, supported his chin with one hand, and put on a feminine smile. Everyone knew his story was coming.</p>
<p>"Director, do you know whether the Qin Dynasty came before the Han Dynasty?" Zi Jun put on a delicate, fully feminine, sharp voice, and his eyes even glanced at a companion like shooting stars.</p>
<p>Everyone firmly believed that his talent for imitating people was almost unprecedented and unsurpassed. From his tone of voice and expression, they inferred that he was imitating Ms. Bi, a history and geography teacher. Ms. Bi struggled to teach, as was well known to her students, who "knew their teacher best." But why would she ask such an absurd question? Everyone couldn't help but suspect Zi Jun's deliberate meanness.</p>
<p>Zi Jun looked at everyone's expressions, hesitated for a moment, then stood up in a delicate and charming way, standing in front of us, twisting his neck and looking at everyone, with one hand behind his back and the tip of his tongue licking his upper lip, and said, "The words you asked about, let me go down and look them up in the dictionary and then tell you." All the companions who had taken Ms. Bi's class exclaimed in unison, and people from other classes laughed along.</p>
<p>Amid everyone's laughter, Zi Jun's expression changed again. He put on a layer of sinister and superficial fake smile on his face, and stood for a while, putting on an appearance that seemed dry and arrogant but was actually weak.</p>
<p>Everyone watched Zi Jun's performance in a daze, and couldn't help but exclaim in unison, "Good!" Zi Jun waved his hand, nodded repeatedly, and switched to the expression of Director Ding of the Academic Affairs Office, saying, "Goodbye, I have business in Nanjing. Two months later, I can come here to stay for a few days and investigate." Zi Jun stopped his performance amid the laughter and went off to find pebbles to play with by himself.</p>
<p>Many companions, some were filled with anger, and some could not stop laughing. Ms. T from the same class sat next to me for half a day without saying a word. Now she said in a strange tone, "They deceive us like this, I really don't know how they can bear it." Zi Jun interjected, "To bear what others bear is not what I call bearing." Everyone laughed again.</p>
<p>The twilight was vast and hazy, and the birds had long returned to the forest. The corner of the Western school building was faintly exposed above the jungle. The smoke from the villagers' cooking drifted with the wind, weaving a picture of the unique evening scenery of midsummer. At this time, I painfully felt that the external scenery of the Western school was very beautiful, but it was inevitably "gold and jade on the outside."</p>
<h3>Composition Class</h3>
<p>— Wei Mei</p>
<p>"Mr. Zhou, when the principal comes, give us a shout." A Yang, afraid of being seen writing a letter by the principal, especially came to smooth things over with Mr. Zhou first.</p>
<p>"Mr. Zhou, when the principal comes, you'd better make a gesture to us -- how about touching your hat?" Wen Yun interjected.</p>
<p>"No, Mr. Zhou, you'd better pinch your nose." He Yu, after reading a book on Wen Hua, looked up and said.</p>
<p>"Oh, don't quarrel..." Mr. Zhou opened his mouth.</p>
<p>"Mr. Zhou, they are very good at quarreling. They don't like to take what's readily available," A Feng opened her mouth.</p>
<p>"A Feng, show me your hand," A Rong shouted in a commanding tone.</p>
<p>"What for?" A Feng said, stretching out her hand.</p>
<p>"Not white at all, I thought you had white hands," A Rong said, looking at it with a smug look.</p>
<p>"Evil carriage (ghost)!" A Feng hit A Rong and sat down to read a novel.</p>
<p>…………………………</p>
<p>There was a faint noise from the corner of the room over there</p>
<p>"Auntie………………"</p>
<p>"………………………"</p>
<p>"………………………"</p>
<p>Yu Cao, the star player on the volleyball team, felt bored sitting down and secretly bounced a ping pong ball on the floor.</p>
<p>"The principal is here," A Geng said, putting on a serious face to everyone.</p>
<p>A Quan was the first to panic and put the book into the desk. Looking back, the principal had not come, so he came over to pinch A Geng. A Geng dodged to the side and knocked over an ink bottle. When A Quan ran over, he knocked off A Yun's dictionary. So A Geng cursed A Quan, and A Yun also hated A Quan. Everything in the classroom was chaotic. Only our Mr. Zhou was still sitting quietly.</p>
<h3>Women's Swimming Team</h3>
<p>— Bing She</p>
<h3>Exploitation</h3>
<p>— Zhu Ming</p>
<p>A certain university in Jiangwan can be regarded as an advanced institution among the private universities in Shanghai. Because it has a long history and its performance is not bad, the number of students who go there to study has increased in recent years, so that the school's dormitories are not enough to accommodate them. However, in order to maintain the school's life, the school has to accept more students to increase revenue. All the students who cannot live in the school have to find ways to live outside the school. So there are some speculative investors and businessmen who have built many houses near the school to rent to students. Their vision is really good and their business is really booming. It is said that every school also has the problem of being full, just like the dormitories inside the school. Therefore, houses stand in rows near the school, in addition to dormitories, there are restaurants, all kinds of companies, shops, vendors, and a constant stream of various vehicles, bustling and lively, forming a university market. And the common purpose of this market is nothing more than to exploit students.</p>
<p>The more demand, the more supply should be, this is a simple law of economics. A certain classmate in the school has seen this business of renting houses and cannot help but arouse his desire for profit, thinking that this business is really a good way to get rich. So during the summer vacation, he chose a vacant lot next to the back gate of the school and built a three-story Western-style dormitory. The rooms are larger than those in the school, but the fees charged are much more expensive. At most, the school's dormitory charges only twenty yuan per semester, but this place charges twenty-five yuan, and the facilities are not necessarily better than those in the school. This shows that his exploitative heart is heavy. Sure enough, this classmate's get-rich movement, by the time school started, the rooms had been fully booked. I am a new student who was admitted this semester. I heard that there were no vacancies in the school's dormitory, so I completed a bed in this place before school started and became one of this classmate's employers.</p>
<p>After living in this dormitory for two days, I heard that the rent for this house is not uniform. The rooms facing south are twenty-five yuan, the rooms facing north are twenty-four yuan, and the rooms facing north and close to the toilet are twenty-three yuan. After knowing this method, I really can't help but admire this classmate's clever research on business. Because in this way, both good and bad rooms will have people living in them, and the business will not be affected by the quality of the room's location. This ingenious method has not been thought of and implemented by the school authorities who are good at extracting and the investors and businessmen who are good at profiting. This classmate has thought of it. This is something that the school authorities who are good at extracting and the investors and businessmen who are good at profiting do not know. In the past, the investors, businessmen, vendors, tea boys, and rickshaw pullers who specialized in exploiting students have now come to the point where students are exploiting students. This is probably a progressive phenomenon in university education.</p>
<p>The accommodation fee is collected completely as soon as one moves in, but the electric lights in the dormitory are dim and unclear, and the tap water everywhere does not flow. The toilet is unbearably filthy, making the people living inside feel a lot of unease, but this fellow classmate landlord does not care about it. This kind of behavior of only knowing how to benefit oneself and not knowing how to benefit others makes me unable to help but shout out a few times, "Exploitation, exploitation!" (Moved reward to help disaster relief)</p>
