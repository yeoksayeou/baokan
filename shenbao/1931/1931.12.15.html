<p>時評</p>
<h3>日本實行金再禁（一）</h3>
<p>日民政黨内閣下台。政友會重新組閣。其施政之第一着。即爲實行金再禁。此與民政黨濱口内閣於上台之初。第一着即實行金解禁之往事。遙遙相對。　　金解禁爲日民政黨政綱之一。濱口内閣以斷然之手段。不顧一切。堅决實行。其始意何嘗不認爲挽救「不景氣」之唯一要着。然而結果則何如。終民政黨之組閣期間。長爲深刻擴大之不景氣所苦悶。濱口且遂爲不景氣所葬送。今政友會内閣又毅然實行金再禁矣。時而解禁。時而再禁。殆有如魔術家之舞弄其萬花筒。令人無可捉摸。但無論此萬花筒之舞弄者如何誇示其靈活之手段。其由於目前整個資本主義經濟系統動搖崩潰之一不可遏抑之狂潮。在日本激起空前之騷動與恐怖。使一切政治家都手忙腳亂。茫然無法應付。則爲一實切不移之事實。國民經濟學者開尼斯曾有言。「我們今日陷於無救的迷團中。因爲我們在處理一架靈活的機器（資本主義的經濟機器）時。着實是迷誤了。這架機器的規律。我們一點也不了解。」日本之時而金解禁。時而金再禁。正所以顯示日本有產者之首腦對於目前資本主義恐慌動搖之狂潮。無所措其手足。而惘惘然立於恐慌之政面。扮演其迷惘顚倒之滑稽劇。</p>
<p>日本此次實行金再禁之主因。自爲世界經濟之整個凋敝。由於世界經濟凋敝之影響。處於世界經濟連鎖中之日本。乃陷於極端不景氣之深淵。產業凋零。物價跌落。海外貿易銳减。失業羣衆激增。此一事實。使日本產業資本階級感受絕大之打擊。而以產業資本。地主與軍閥爲背景之政友會。當其一旦大權重握。自基於挽救產業衰落之立場上。毅然施行金再禁。此於代表金融資產階級如三井三菱安田住友等銀行利益之前井上藏相。竭力反對再禁。與代表產業資產階級如紡織業等利益之武藤山治等之贊成再禁諸現象中。蓋已顯露其端倪。</p>
<p>次之。日本自金弛禁而後。其正貨之流出。急激增加。而正貨之準備。乃急激减少。維持海外之匯兌價格。與鞏固國内之信用基礎。兩者時相扞格。無可協調。據日本銀行十一月十一日發行之日银週報所言。其準備額對鈔票之準備百分率。已减至四九·五。正貨之急激流出。已使日匯兌制度呈現絕大之危機。故金再禁自爲應時而產生之必然現象。不過政友會之實行此政策。並非爲金融資本階級輸出入得到相當改善之利益作想而純爲挽救衰落不振之產業爲本階級之利益而敲其如意算盤。</p>
<p>復次。自大不列顚突然宣告暫時停止金本位以來。金磅頓時跌落百分之二十。其在海外貿易。尤其在運輸業上獲得長足之增進。而使日本海外貿易以及郵船會社。蒙受競爭上之絕大損失。日紡織品之從印度市場中逐出。即其明證。其在我國則復以東北禍變之爆發。引起我全國空前抵制日貨之高潮使一向入超之日本。在貿易上更一落千丈。即從前盛極一時之紡織。業此時亦呈無可挽救之勢。日本本爲以輕工業立國之國家。其在輕工業方面。旣遭受如此鉅大之威脅。自不得不引起產業資產階級之憂慮恐怖。急起而籌謀挽救之對策。禁金出口。立即可使貨幣價值下降。物價上騰。復以貨幣價值下降之故。减低其生產費以與停止金本位後之大下列顚平手以爭奪海外市場。并以擾亂我國之排斥日貨運動。故金再禁之最大作。用乃在於政友會欲從恢復海外貿易爭奪海外市場着手。以恢復其凋落不振之產業。所謂「不景氣打開策。」特爲欺騙其他一大部分日人之密語甜言。實則政友會不過爲其本階級利益奪門耳。不過爲與代表金融資本之民政黨爭領導權耳。深刻擴大之不景氣。果眞可以因金再禁而遂得打開耶。</p>

<p>大學社會化　高踐四</p>
<p>學校當爲「社會之中心」問題、在美國發生於二十年前左右、人生在精神與物質方面均有需要、如何滿足并指導此種需要、乃大學惟一之職責、講學·求學·治學·考察·研究·試騐等等都是方法、滿足并指導人生之需要是目的、方法與目的是有密切關係的—他們非但不能各自各、而且應當要適合、方法須確能達到目的、才算兩者適合、譬如身體健康是目的、講究衛生之道是方法、假使所講究的衛生之道於身體健康毫無所補、甚至反有所損、則方法與目的之不相干或不適合乃可不言而喻了</p>
<p>所責乎大學者、因其能滿足人生正當之需要、并指導不正當之需要使歸之於正當也、怎樣能使大學盡此職責、須大學社會化爲「社會之中心」、何謂社會化、大學以社會之安危及社會之進步與不進步爲已任、就是大學社會化、古人云「天下興亡匹夫有責」、其意是個人須社會化、我們現在明要主張的是、「社會安危（及進步與不進步）大學之責」</p>
<p>大學非最高學府麼、非各項專家與社會領導者之所自出麽、非衆望之所歸麼、大學、大學、能不以社會之安危引爲已責麼、</p>
<p>所以世界和平之動搖、經濟之恐慌、失業者之日多、思想之走入歧途、及中國内亂相尋、土匪遍地、生産落後、洪水爲災、攘利爭權、、政治不修明、風俗澆薄、以及其他種種惡現象、沒有一件不是由於大學之不盡厥職、從另一方面言、大學本身亦必自負曰、「要想世界永久和平麼、失業减少麼、中國生產發達麼、治水有人麼、政治修明麼……不得不靠大學不得不望大學人才輩出」、大學旣當仁不讓、如此自負、在學遠不應該社會化麼、</p>
<p>大學社會化有小大之分、大學若勉爲一鄉一邑之中心、即可名之曰一鄉、邑之大學、若勉爲一國或全世界之中心、即可名之曰一國或世界之大學</p>
<p>古人云、「天下興亡、匹夫有責」這是要個人社會化、今人云、「社會安危、大學之責、」這是要大學社會化、勉哉、勉哉、大學社會化</p>

<h3>江大足球曁南得决賽權</h3>
<p>五比一昨克復旦</p>
<p>又將與交大决賽</p>
<p>江大體協會之足球錦標賽、昨日曁南與復旦在江灣交鋒兩隊實力均強故是戰極爲重要、開始後十分鐘内、曁南即得二球、後復旦亦得一球、上半時曁南以三比一佔優、下半時曁南又得二球、結果成五與一之比、曁南勝、觀者頗爲踴躍大半爲復旦學生、海上球迷前往參觀者、亦屬不少、茲紀詳情如下、</p>
<p>曁南大學陣線</p>
<p>江宗錦</p>
<p>丘東炎　馮運佑</p>
<p>梁樹棠　莊田鴻　陳福忠（上）　馮和祥（下）</p>
<p>顧尙動　楊保淼　陳鎭和　陳鎭祥　梅洪寶</p>
<p>復旦大學陣線</p>
<p>揚固慶　瞿鴻德</p>
<p>王樹　森關洵安</p>
<p>謝國柱　胡繼武　李琳</p>
<p>孫惠培（下）　鄧焚士（上）　周紹文　余順華　龔以恂　何基棠</p>
<p>復旦自取其咎</p>
<p>裁判員陳吉祥嗚笛、開賽復旦開球、曁南一舉即侵及復旦門前、相戰未及五分鐘、復旦王樹森救球不愼、將球誤頂入自己門内、曁南喜出望外、復旦則懊喪萬分、曁南得此球後、精神益爲振刷、相戰又約五分鐘、復旦復被罰十二碼球、陳鎭和踢、入十分鐘内、曁南連得兩球、復旦自取其咎而已、</p>
<p>曁南龍門攻破</p>
<p>復旦失此兩球、殊爲不幸、抖擻精神、雄圖宏展、曁南丘東炎意欲救球外出、不料打在馮漢佑背上、守門江宗錦欲救不及、復旦龔以恂見機衝上、射入門内、復旦遂還敬一球、軍容爲之一振、再與人兵、但曁南豈肯示弱、努力抵抗、復旦卒無可如何、陳保淼一度攻進、無功而還、雲時間梅洪寶帶球傳中、陳鎭祥截住、在肉搏聲中、陳攻入復旦球門、上半時成三與一之比、曁南佔優</p>
<p>小梅打得有眼</p>
<p>再戰聲起、曁南雄兵、侵入敵營、梅洪寶變脚玲瓏、亦建奇功、是球打在橫木彈入䋞底、無法挽救、離下半時開始僅三分鐘耳、時復旦守門瞿鴻德姍姍來遲、即戎裝出場、坐鎭龍門、復旦膽量大壯、前鋒壓迫曁南、孙惠培一次機會、不料操之過急、斜出底線、殊爲可惜、曁南大軍又至圍攻復旦、瞿鴻德成爲衆矢之的、疲於應付、幸關洵安監守得法、未致失利</p>
<p>結果五與一比</p>
<p>混戰聲中、陳鎭和與李琳小有衝突、但未動武、由裁判員及雙方球員排解始罷、復旦再度反攻、又無建樹、反見曁南陳鎭和、帶球深入復旦門前、離門約有十餘碼處、遠射攻門、球着著球滚去、勢甚銳急、復旦瞿守門不用手而用足、球向其跨下滾入網窩、瞿大爲失策、致成大錯、結果曁南遂以五比一凱　、</p>
<p>又逢交大决賽</p>
<p>曁南昨日勝來甚易、操縱全場、復旦人才平均可取、因今日須晋京請願、忽忙之中、戰來甚爲膽小、經騐自亦較差、不如曁南之大刀闊斧、兩翼甚弱、中鋒三人甚佳、李琳有特殊表演、連年曁南逢交大决賽、今日又是如此、眞冤家逢狹路、</p>
<p>曁南成績　交大成績</p>
<p>勝持志　　棄權　　　勝中央　　六比一勝大夏　　八比Ｏ　　勝光華　　六比Ｏ勝復旦　　五比一　　中公之戰十九可勝</p>

<h3>抗日之聲</h3>
<p>— 良</p>
<p>蚌埠長淮衛本報代派人程鳳山之父程德高。字仰之。今年六十六歲，向以書史爲樂。因閱申報紀載黑垣馬主席。孤軍抗日事。每日對民衆宣講。常痛哭流涕。繼而聞馬軍退至克山。遂拍案大呌。色頓慘變。並朗誦一絕命詩。曰將傾大廈更誰支。莽莽神州等睡獅。吩咐兒曹聽遺囑。鋤強當報阿爺知。吟罷長嘆一聲。氣亦遂絕。耆年愛國。并以身殉。不可不爲之紀。</p>

<h3>小朋友的雞（下）</h3>
<p>給徐君企周的一封信</p>
<p>我猜度你或者已經想到了後期的進展，怕是因爲環境的阻礙，所以不得已停止在第二個階段上。這，我們當然有相當的原諒。范靜生先生告訴過我從前京師大學因爲日本教習在講堂上教學生解剖了一隻羊，引起了西太后震怒，管學大臣張百煕急得入朝叩頭自請處分。這和你的孵雞大同小異。不過在文明的上海，像「學校重地，毋許孵雞」一類事，大概不致發生吧？因此，我勸你鼓起勇氣，幹他一下。</p>
<p>第一個階段的教育連花也不會開，何況菓子！第二個階段的教育只會開花，不會結菓。到了第三個階段才會結菓但未必有美味而碩大的菓子。要想有美味而碩大的菓子必得跳上第四個階段。第四個階段是教學做合一之極則：它在此處已與科學打成一片了。</p>
<p>試拿小朋友的鷄做個例子。孵雞是必不可少的活動。若是養雞兩羣：一羣用公雞，一羣無公雞，將兩羣雞所生的雞蛋各做一記號，孵起來，看那羣的雞蛋孵得出小雞來，那就更好了。再進一步，把孵了三天，五天，七天，九天……的蛋，解剖開來，看看各蛋起了什么變化，做起一套從雞蛋發育到小雞的標本來，豈不是更有意思嗎？再進一步，試騐各種雞生蛋力及遺傳之比較在小學裹並不是不可以逐漸推行的。當然，小學還有別的功課，不是孵雞研究所，那能盡量的幹？可是孵幾隻雞，做幾套標本，總不能算是奢望。你是有經騐的小學教師，你看我所陳述的這些意思對不對呢？希望你不吝指教。祝你領導小朋友們向大自然進攻。……</p>
<h3>甲午之役中之無名　英雄</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>甲午之役。我國雖未勝利。然頗有一二英雄。忠烈效命。足以光耀史冊。如鄧世昌·左寶貴等是也。曩嘗聞我友明道顧子。爲談是役中尙有無名英雄朱鐵槍其人之軼事一則。我友健筆。或已紀諸於書。然予未之獲覩。茲姑將予所聞者。述諸於下。以爲抗日同志之模範人物。朱鐵槍佚其名號。自幼即勇武絕倫。善使槍。舞時上下左右。圜轉如飛。愈舞愈急。祇見白光一團。不見人影。潑以巨盎之水。襟裳間無點滴之沾濡。蓋光氣緊繞。無隙可入也。因有朱鐵槍之號。甲午啓釁。鐵槍奮起。投左寶貴麾下。屢獲勝利。寶貴亟賞其伉健。擢用之。平壤之戰。鐵槍與左各率一軍。以敵倭寇。倭素聞朱之勇且憤其殺戮之衆。乃大舉以報仇。鐵槍縱馬馳騁。殺倭又數百千人。奈敵衆已寡。倭卒如潮涌至。朱軍死傷無算。屍積爲京觀。鐵槍仍不稍退却。或有勸之者。鐵槍怒目欲裂眦。曰。大丈夫當爲戰而死。屍裹馬革。我無怨也。旣而鐵槍自陣中衝出。以援救左之被圍。時從鐵槍者祇三四百騎。鐵槍率之以一敵百。獲左出中軍。倭之左右翼襲至。巨砲發彈。如雷霆之輘　。硝烟藥火。迷蒙不得張眸。鐵槍不稍畏怯。劇鬭之餘。卒被擊殺倭皇三姪。倭益恨鐵槍。兵四圍殊堅。鐵槍與左抉盪之間。而無情之彈。中鐵槍肘臂。爲之斷折。流血涔涔。沙磧易色。遂與左俱死。臨死猶大聲疾呼殺倭奴不置。聞者烈之。夫倭奴與我中華。有積世之讐。此次蹂躙東北。視我人民。有如俎上之肉。若不急起圖之。則國之不存。民將安附。朱鐵槍魂兮有知。定飲泣於九京也。</p>
<h3>無綫電避免飛機殺人之新發明</h3>
<p>— 黃影呆</p>
<p>飛機一物。雖爲近世交通之惟一要具。然自發明以來。飛行之人。因航空而犧牲生命者。已不堪計數。最近如中國之詩人徐志摩。亦因航空而殞命。是以歐西各國對於飛機失事問題。備極注意。希</p>
<p>有以減少航空家生命之危險倫。敦方成面。近發明一法。利用無線電傳遞消息。用以减少飛機之肇禍。此法通行而後。實可援救不少航空家之生命。其法爲何。即預測天氣之劇變。利用無線電以傳遞消息也。遠在千哩之外。忽起颶風。則測候器上。即可發現波紋。報告消息。發明此法者。爲英人瓦斯氏。此器先時可置於一小屋中。千哩之外。即有細小之電光發射。此測侯器即可由無線電之作用。跳入黑暗之處。再用目力視察。則颶風之發現於大西洋也。中亞細亞也。亞洲也。可一望而知。風力之大小。氣溫之高底。均有紀錄可檢。而此器更有特殊驚人處者。即在一秒鐘之内。可表現符記三·○○○種。是故測候之人。隨時可指出暴風起於何處。英國北部及蘇格蘭地方。有天文臺兩所。作相互之合作。對於狂風暴雨之起止及地點。更見明晰。然後再將所得結果。報告於航空之人。俾彼等早作准備。勿與暴風相撞。是以肇禍事件。亦可减少矣。</p>

<p>岑熾　（下）</p>
<p>熾肅容對曰。令媛生長閥閱之門。吾一窮書生。非偶也。先伯曰。君子固窮之說。子所素守。以如斯才學。他日之名位。當出老夫上。奈何以貧爲辭。知已之言。由衷而吐。子細察之。卒議婚焉。因納粟爲貳尹。入陜甘總督陶模幕·援長安縣縣丞。以模介。識布政使岑春萱。春萱先世固浙籍。序行輩。爲同族兄弟。久之。二人交益厚。熾廉潔自守。方正不阿。且有過人之識。知人之鑑。春萱旣擢陜撫。模將乞退歸田。遂以師禮迎熾居署中。百事諮商而後行。自是而晋蜀而兩粵。熾未嘗一日離左右。故事大府幕僚年終考績。例得請銓敘其官。俗所謂保案者是。春萱每置熾名於疏首。熾往往執筆塗去。怫然不悅曰。非吾所欲。不可強耳。春萱以爲謙讓。詢之。熾曰。吾攬鏡自相。富貴於我無分焉。春萱笑曰。公固嘗爲貳尹。非官耶。熾曰。是亦足矣。萱知其志莫可奪。從此不復言。熾於萱之舉措。適於情合於理者。無不贊其成。反是。面諍不稍恕。萱平日罔論何人之言。言之當否。皆不屈。獨視熾爲良師益友。言聽計從。糾彈弈劻等諸疏。俱出熾之手。辛亥革命軍興。萱再起爲蜀督。電召熾往。不赴。固請。然後渡輪之漢阜。告萱曰。天下將大亂。是不過微露其苗耳。退進出處公自决。吾老矣。不能相從。遂歸。歸後易裝道士。日徜徉于山林泉石間。吟詩高歌爲樂。某歲。扶杖登泰山。謁聖曲阜。咨嗟太息曰。大道之不行也久。矣天下之大亂不遠矣。吾不忍覩焉。年七十有幾而卒。子郊麟。能傳其家學。純正肖乃父。清末。知安微無爲州。人民國。累司榷稅。爲宰武進。不茍取毫鬃。明德之後。必有達人。吾於是益信焉。</p>

<h3>與子同仇（十二）</h3>
<p>— 顧明道</p>
<p>第三章虎口逃生</p>
<p>當那槍彈飛來時。幸虧華乃強眼光敏速。趕忙一蹲身。槍子從他頭上掠過。沒有命中。華乃強乘這當兒回手一槍。早將那太陽兵擊倒在地。翻身跳下墻來。忠淑蹲在地上。先聞槍聲。後見華乃強躍下。知道他已脫險。連忙立起身來。華乃強道。好險哪。一個太陽兵追來。幸被我擊死了。我們快走罷。於是二人望僻靜處逃奔。這時各處已佈滿太陽軍。檢查甚嚴。二人將手槍盒子砲藏在衣底。以免賊人瞧見。發生阻碍。他們想城中是去不得了。還是望Ｔ城走吧。可是在他們途程中。必須越過鐵路。而那方面正駐着太陽軍。萬一盤詰起來。難以兎脫。於是二人商議之下。現在方當緊急之際。白晝逃奔。甚爲不便。且有危險。不如待到晚上再走。此刻且尋個藏身所在。暫避一下爲妙。二人望田野間跑了一二里路。見有一處矮屋。門前一個老婦正和一個七八歲的男孩子。在那裹探頭張望。二人跑至屋前。老婦先迎上前。向華乃強問道。先生。你們打從城裹來的麼。華乃強點頭答道。正是。老婦又道。昨晚鬧的槍砲聲。險些把我們魂都嚇掉了。今晨聽說是太陽國來攻打我們的城池。我們也不知怎麼一回事。可憐我的兒子長福在城内做傭工。不知他的性命如何。我們盼念得很。說至此又把手指着小孩子道。他是我的孫兒。他正嬲着我要帶他去看爹爹咧。先生。你想我們有這膽量進城的麼。華乃強道。不錯。你們不要進城去。我們也從那邊逃來。太陽軍是殘暴不堪的啊。華乃強說罷。這孩子哭起爸爸來了。忠淑上前勸住他的啼哭。華乃強向老婦說道。我們要想借你的屋裹暫避一下。夜間再行逃走。現在快些進去。免得被他們瞧見了。多生騷擾。老婦遂引二人入内。屋中甚是黑暗而湫隘。二人也不顧了。對坐下來休息。默然無語。他們門口裹雖然不響。而心中思潮歷落。憤火中燒。十分難過得很。老婦端上兩杯茶來敬客。忠淑道。請你千萬別忙。我們只要叨擾你家兩頓飯好了。去時當重重謝你。老婦道。不忙的。客人寬坐。</p>

<p>昨華商證券交易所各債券市况、現貨雖仍有多種開出、但成交較前稀少、全日祇開出一萬五千元、期貨十二月期依然殊屬沉靜、市上仍祇零星交易、市面續鮮生氣、而開拍已將半月、始終未有交易之一月份期貨、昨忽全部做開、但成交亦屬無多、計期貨本下月期交易、上下午各約一百七十萬元、合計三百三十九萬五千元、至各債情形、趨勢大致仍頗和緩、較前亦未有重大漲落、各盤間均盤旋上落殊微、結果以較前週、除裁兵現貨下降達三元四角、期貨亦跌一元二角、二○開捲現貨各跌一元許、其他多僅小半元左右、惟觀諸市面情况、已較前爲不安、日内閣改組之後、其對我態度、仍極蠻橫、陰謀侵略、續承前轍、而法復有窺邊之訊、以是外交勢殊悲觀、加之國内、金融債八千萬已在發行、凡茲種種均與債券市環象有巨大關係、一般市上人心、愈難樂觀、投資者觀望不前、需要之不振、有加未已、而零戶忍痛售出者、仍不寂寞、於是債券遂益低落、查昨各債劵市價、除整六關稅裁兵九六外、其他均已跌至前部所定之最低限價、如不急求救濟、則債券市暫將無形停市、糾紛將亦隨之而起、故日内之證券市前途、大堪注意、</p>

<h3>紗花本月紗獨俏</h3>
<p>其餘一致平疲</p>
<p>紗市平疲、趨勢異常衰弱、因國事混亂、金融緊急、致人心虛弱、大勢狀況軟化、現紗銷路頗清、以銀根難鬆、各幫無購買力、惟蜀幫極有大量的進意、然銀根缺乏、不能暢辦、故零星交易、尙不斷絕云、</p>
<p>本月紗散空過多、人標前市開盤、以金市不振、市氣甚軟、惟本月以散空太多、漲三·四錢、遠跌三·五錢、午後本月又漲二·四錢、遠跌一·二·三錢、全日成交統計一萬二千六百包、查賣出賡豐二千五百包、公泰六百包、昌記五百五十包、愼記四百五十包、買進和愼一千二百包、厚豐一千二百包、義餘五百五十包、裕大四百包、茲將收盤價列左、</p>

<h3>棉市被金價壓落</h3>
<p>日本重禁金出口</p>
<p>棉市平疲、因海外棉市軟化、而日本重禁金出口、致金價大落、匯兌鬆濫、人心虛慌、遠月以新拋戶較缺、形勢尙平、近月以銀根緊急、現銷不動、較爲疲弱、惟漢幫多頭、尙不肯放鬆云、</p>
<p>漢標近月跌三錢　交易所漢標前市開盤尙平、金價大落、近跌一錢五分、遠平、午後本月又跌一錢五分、遠跌五分至一錢、全日成交統計二萬九千七百担、查賣出愼昌四千担、願大一千六百担、長豐一千六百担、公泰一千九百担、買進吉豐二千三百担、裕大一千六百担、昶記一千三百担、義餘一千担、協生一千六百担、永昌一千担、茲將漢標收盤價列左、</p>

<h3>印英棉業週訊</h3>
<p>孟買　上週因平果爾及奧姆辣收成不多及遲延之故、市况甚堅、買戶方面、因之不能不出善價以應需要、據報白蘭溪收成良好、週五之跌、乃因日本將棄本位及日本出口商大批賣出所致、現貨場中、出口商買進皮拉爾及中央省新棉、本地廠商購買美棉、歐洲出口商在此比價較高時、暫無問訊希望、附錄上週統計如下、（單位千包）</p>

<p>利物浦　上週現貨交易甚佳、期貨雖有日本將棄金本位之傳聞、依然平淡、週初因美棉政府報告利於多頭而堅、旋即回軟、南方囤棉運動、繼續進行、惟因金融關係、營業不振、致難上漲、培斯勒地方之財政會議、希望或能解决此問題、埃及棉市况呆滯、細絨棉不易脫手、</p>
<h3>糧食南北米市清淡如故</h3>
<p>南頭　昨日來源仍寂寥、約十餘號、但浦存不弱、城鄉店銷、究緣時局不寗、銀根奇緊、况又爲小月底收賬之期、人心尤覺平淡、各行竟無貪意、均抱縮小、厚新粳疲落角許、薄稻存貨尙豐、本街交易無幾、寗胃各有、市價暫居平穩、走勢雖薄、因貨稀市勢帶挺、</p>
<p>新聞　各貨銷路依然清淡、西路來源尙旺、蘇州河下船貨存底豐厚、因天時轉冷、各米舖不願多添、恐防再低、亦未可知、人心稍平、西新薄稻各短一角、洋埠尖到銷二平、變陰元到積有限、酒胃動而不振、零交亦平庸、價格無榮辱、</p>
<h3>現洋米價落動銷</h3>
<p>跌小角許本客續辦</p>
<p>昨日洋米市况　因時局不寗、人心搖動、洋行雖有拋售、而進戶並無問津、現貨實化亦淡、市面呆滯與期貨相似、但貨主有願貶價求脫者、結果市價小去角許、銷化始見活潑、本街辦意較濃、漢幫亦有問訊統市開出五千左右、小絞佔十分之七、價九元五六角、次至九元二角四分、一號西貢十元○九角半至十元○八角二分云、</p>
<h3>麫粉廠商大批拋空</h3>
<p>昨日粉市呈初定繼跌之象、上午因洋麥報價曾好二三角左右、故人心尙見穩定、迨至下午各盤、以金市又有劇烈之變動、匯率突長、大部份人心又爲衝動、幾家大廠、又拋出二三十萬包、致人心趨疲、均呈不振、觀察後步、如金市再落、仍難看佳也、結果本月份較前週跌一分、一月份跌一分、二三月份各跌一分半、四月份跌一分二厘半、五月份跌一、分半云</p>
<h3>本月麥多頭猛出</h3>
<p>最低度三兩二錢半</p>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上下午開盤後、各月份市面、大致呈近期愈慘、遠亦不振之象、本月份因不久又須交割、交易所之實在籌碼、聞頗湧旺、收貨方面、則廠家尙未活動、致多頭難以堅擯、開價之後、步步下跌、收盤之最低價、竟至三兩二錢半、此種市值、大有貨不值錢之慨、一月份因值陰歷年終、人心亦軟、遠期則尙安定、結果本月份較前週又跌五分、一月份跌四分、二月份不動、三月份跌二分、四月份跌一分、五月份初開三兩七錢三分、旋亦跌一分云、</p>
<h3>糖市太古糖存薄市穩</h3>
<p>粗砂白又復下沉</p>
<p>昨糖市產區電訊、均無到來、公會市場劃盤、交易依然零落、荷糖二十四號粗砂白、價跌至九兩七錢、中砂白九兩六錢、綿荷白十一兩二錢交易不多、趨勢仍弱、太古糖市雖微挫、然進出尙見活躍、Ｂ嘜十一兩六錢半至二分半、ＤＹ嘜十一兩六錢、ＨＸ嘜十一兩五錢至四錢七分半、ＨＭ嘜十一兩三錢半、市形尙穩、蓋以市存殊薄之故</p>
<h3>油市白桐油新貨未旺</h3>
<p>白桐油自出新以來、各產地出價漸見暢旺、漢口所到者、仍以陳油爲多、因長江上游冬令水淺、運輸上不免遲滯、新油之不能湧到、職是故也、洋莊在漢辦者、仍是少數、價格於前週曾做過二十三兩二三錢、上週稍鬆爲二十三兩至二十二兩七八錢洋規、内銷油老牌行家批十八兩洋例紋、本埠油麻號家所銷、以浙桐爲多、故並不注意漢市之消長也、浙桐新油、初見時尙在每砠送申三十一元、旋跌三十元、照近日祇值二十九元光景、惟聞金衢蘭永一帶、油坊須先榨柏油、待柏車鬧汛稍過、始可開榨桐油、故初見新時、祇有少數、冬至後可一律改榨桐油矣、據近日金蘭等處函詳、出貨已稍見旺、價仍須二十八元幾角蘭交、若到滬埠尙在三十元左右、因是本埠號家辦者甚少、大槪目光在二十九元稍弱、均要入手矣、蓋價已至此、自可無虞再跌、然洋莊無大批去路、亦難過於望好、在出新之際、所以後去市面、似在長疲短俏、縱有漲跌、亦祇一二元上落而已、本埠存積並不豐厚、銷路因冬令亦屬平淡、惟過年貨均未有備、故陰歷年内、須有一批購進、俾供新春之銷暢也、</p>
<h3>絲茶海外絲電不轉</h3>
<p>華洋絲商均抱觀望</p>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊絲市、雖因海外日絲轉漲、而市氯轉堅、奈上週中發往歐美之期現絲電報、昨均不轉、華洋雙方均抱觀望、昨祇在星等進下身白乾經十包、克昌進沔陽黃絲十二包、價仍平疲云、</p>
<h3>南北貨紅黑棗升降互易</h3>
<p>天津紅棗、茲因地價轉升、申市亦隨之而緊、如頂上之頭戶紅棗須十三四兩、次之十一二兩二戶紅九兩、三戶紅七兩、什路貨平平、府紅棗七兩半、毫紅棗九兩半、鷄心紅八兩六錢、各幫走塲尙屬活潑、惟黑棗反見鬆落、下檔貨閩屬福州廈門興化等均有交易、昨市黑棗頭售十七兩、以次自十五兩半至十兩不一、趨勢平平、</p>
<h3>五金會司鐵氣象重振</h3>
<p>會司鐵交易、近來漸見轉機、蓋出口幫、若青島·烟台等幫、俱有點綴、而廠家方面、恐來市標準回漲、故多下手採辦、雖在連日寂寞之五金市中、共成交有四五百箱之多、行情老鋼廠二十八兩五錢、新鋼廠二十七兩五錢、法蘭西貨二十五兩、比之先前標準、均各好起二三錢不等云、</p>

<h3>大達公司大德輪慘燬記</h3>
<p>燒死與溺斃一百餘人</p>
<p>救出員客計三百餘名</p>
<p>二買辦燒死老軌凍斃</p>
<p>大達公司大德號輪、此次由滬赴通揚、行至將近滸浦、地名七望沙、船内失火、全輪被燬、旅客船員之投江而死、以及救起後凍斃者達一百餘人、誠爲該公司大吉慘案後第二次慘劇也、茲就記者調查所得、詳誌如下、</p>
<p>失火情形　大德輪船、第二艙内、裝有洋夾子美棉二百件、外面環裝白糖四百餘包、本月十三日上午一時半、從上海開出、至常熟滸浦相近、地名七黃沙時、係在上午十一時四十分鐘、船上船員水手旅客等、正在午餐、棉花艙内、突然冒烟、起火之時、船員均未得知、及經發見、黑烟上冲、船上水手、即飛報船主樂長命、急謀撲救、及經該船傳集全體船員水手、各取皮帶及消防器具等、吸水灌射、時火已穿出艙面、燒及台甲矣、</p>
<p>風大火烈　二層台甲均係木板所造、着火即燃、船主等見射水無效、遂取豫備在輪應急所用滅火藥水施射、無如是日天氣最寒、而風力尤大、火頭燒着二層客艙後、得風力之煽助、蔓延極速、雖有滅火藥、及皮帶水、竟絕無效力、至十二時以後、二層艙已全行着火矣、至是船主等咸束手無策、</p>
<p>懸旗求救　船主樂長命以射水無效、急切狂拉求救回聲、冀圖往來輪協助救護、不意仍無應救者、至是不得已、再將救命旗扯起、一面則由在輪船員冒烟突火、越至上台夾、擬放小舢板船、駁救在輪旅客、豈意吊懸舢板之繩、尙未及解下、火已燒到上台夾矣、</p>

<p>社會消息</p>
<h3>荷屬東印度經濟的不景　丘斌存</h3>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>荷屬東印度、計有七十三萬四千平方哩、大於荷蘭本國底面積六十倍、荷蘭國對於東印度殖民地關係的重要、無異英帝底生命呼吸在其印度殖民地的密切一樣、</p>
<p>荷屬東印度底生產、在國際市場上頗居重要的地位、其主要物產像金雞納霜、占世界產額底八百之九十、木棉占百分之八十、葫椒占百分之七十、樹膠占百分之三十、錫茶均占百分之二十、蔗糖咖啡均占百分之一十、</p>
<p>當此世界商業的不景氣下、荷屬東印度底經濟、自然也要受了莫大的打擊、其主要物產底價格、一落千丈、如樹膠每担的市價、由二百八十盾、降爲十八盾、蔗糖每担底的市價、由一十八盾、降爲八盾、胡椒每担底市價、由一百八十盾、降爲五十盾、其他產物底價格、也莫不大减而特减啦、</p>
<p>荷屬東印度因受世界經濟恐慌底影響、就必然地發生了商業的不景氣底痼疾、商業不景氣底結果、社會上就又必然地發生下列種種的現象、</p>
<p>（一）限制生產　關此只要舉出一個例子、就可以槪括其餘了、像糖一項、因爲俄人以廉於渣華糖托辣司、採用探併政策ＤｕｍｐｉｎｇＰｏｌｉｃｙ貶價傾銷於南洋英屬印度等處、致使荷屬東印度底蔗糖、也不得不折本出售、又以古巴實行了减少蔗糖的種植底原故、使荷蘭政府也不得不發出命令、限制本年蔗糖底產額爲二百四十萬噸、比較上年二百九十萬噸底產額、减少了五十萬噸、並規定此去三年内、每年得遞加十萬噸、至一九三四年、俾可出產二百七十萬噸、以後即依此爲產額標準、</p>
<p>（二）商家破產　棉蘭荷蘭商會、曾開職員會議、討論關於商業問題、席間該會主席、對於今年商場的觀察、有了許多意見發表、大意稱查得今年商業的冷淡、日甚一日、在這過去三季間、各商報窮（破產）的數目、計在二百五十家以上、且在此年關將屆的一季中、必尤增多、因此推測、在這一半中、其報窮者、將不下四百家了、查在一九三○年中、其報窮者計有一百七十五家、一九二九年、計有一百一十八家、一九二八年、計有八十一家、一九二六年、計有五十二家、由此可見、自一九二六年至今、這島底商業有如江河日下之勢、若就全荷印計之、今年破產之數、至少在數千家了、</p>
<p>（三）人民失業　據荷印商業聯合會秘書、對荷文東印度報記者談話、稱該會</p>
<p>現有會員八百四十一人、其中有了七十一人失業、就是說每十人中有了一人失業、：從前女性速記打字員、每月獲得二百五十盾的位置、殊甚易謀、現則每月可得一百五十盾、即可引爲幸事了、</p>
<p>又據巴達維亞九月十七日所發表、勞工介紹所底報告、稱截至本年六月杪止、失業人數竟達八千四百人、其中歐人占二千四百名、華僑四百六十名、巫人五千五百名、查該大批失業者、多數欲任書記職務、而當地目下需要的人才、爲技術</p>
<p>家、反有其他專門學識者、至書記一職、各公署及商店、老早已有人滿之患、無怪失業者之日見增多、查失業羣衆中、大半爲中小畢業生、不受教育底工人、還不計算在内、</p>
<p>（四）貿易銳减　一個地方對外貿易的進出貨底數目字大、就可知其經濟蓬勃、還過來說、如果進出貨底數目字小、就可决其經濟的衰落、現在說到荷印底對外貿易、簡單一句話是簡形銳减的、我們且看他一九二八、二九、三○年進出口貨底比較表、</p>
<p>年　份　　入　口　　出　口　　總　額</p>
<p>一九二八　一○三○　一五九○　二六二○一九二九　一一六六　一四八八　二六五四一九三○　　九二三　一二三三　二一五六　　在這三年中、出口方面是年减一年的、入口方面只有一九二九年、是比一九二八年多、但是入口貨的增多、並不是好現象、而且到一九三○年、入口貨又就大减了、至拿一九三○年與一九二九年比較、入口貨减少了二億四千三百萬盾、出口貨减少了二億五千五百萬盾、而貿易總額、則減少了五萬萬盾、不可謂非巨大了、</p>
<p>我們再看巴達維亞中央統計局所發表、本年九月份爪哇進口貨槪况、據稱本年九月份入口、共爲九萬九千八百七十噸、值荷幣三千六百四十五萬八千盾、去年同月進口十五萬二千二百三十九噸、值荷幣五千零五十九萬四千盾、至於自一月至九月統計、本年爲一百三十萬四千八百四十六噸、值荷幣四百一十一兆八十萬九千盾、而去年同期間則爲一百四十七萬零三十四噸、值荷幣五百二十六兆三十七萬六千盾、我們於此可以曉得荷印底貿易、一月不如一月、一年减少一年了、</p>
<p>（五）緊縮政策　吧城（巴達維亞）荷印政府、自今年發生不景氣後、爲應付政費起見、不得不採緊縮政策、原會議决批准明年一月一日起、所有在全荷屬各政界機關任職的公務人員、一律减薪十巴仙、但最近據財政部底預算、因國庫的支絀、故向荷政府建議、將减薪底日期、提前於十一月份開始實行、吧督已經批准、預算二個月節省支出的欵額、可有一百五十萬盾的、</p>
<p>（六）發行公債　吧城荷印政府對於籌畫補救政費支絀一事、除積極實行裁員减薪的緊縮政策外、又舉發一種公債以資彌補、業將舉發公債底理由和數目、提交荷印國民會議通過、及交由荷蘭殖民</p>
<p>大臣審定、查荷印政府發行公債數目、爲二萬萬盾、這個數目超過荷印間所舉發者、因爲現政府入不敷出、數達五千三百六十萬之多、如無此法補救、將再不敷至　萬一千萬、若合前此虧欠者計之、則其數當在二萬萬盾以上、荷政府方面對於舉發這宗巨大的公債、還並不以爲多的、</p>
<p>觀於前頭六節的敘述、可以知道荷印底經濟、是陷於羔羊觸藩的困境中了、</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>荷屬東印度經濟的不景、所受痛苦最甚者、厥爲當地底大衆、而非荷印政府、因爲政府本非實有的、而是假設的、政府財政是量出爲入的、政費不足、仍可取之於大衆、以資縫補、而荷印總人口五千一百萬人中、土人占四千九百萬人、華僑占一百二十萬、荷蘭人不過一十五萬四千人而已、我們這一百二十萬廣大的華僑、在荷屬東印度經濟不景的情勢下、所受的犧牲特甚、現略爲分析述之、</p>
<p>（一）華商破產　巴達維亞訊、九月二十五日華僑方面、經吧城高等審判廳判决、宣告破產者共一十五家、按吧城一地每月華僑破產者以十五家計、每年應是一百八十家、又西爪哇、中爪哇、東爪哇、蘇門答臘、婆羅洲、西里伯、麼鹿加、小巽他等各省府華僑、一年中破產商家、以一百八十家計、何止至於數千家之衆、</p>
<p>（二）被遣回國　棉蘭訊、百格華郵船公司底輪船金馬號、前由海口啓椗開赴中國時、查因無居留權、而被當地政府遣回原籍底華僑、計有一百一十六名、此次尙有日里棉蘭　植公司各園垃淘汰而遣回原籍底華工六十名、合計一百七十六名、按棉蘭、吧城各海口、每月開赴中國底船、至少有三四次、每次華僑被遣或因無職業自動返國者、總有數百人、全年華僑被遣或自動回國者、則至少在數萬人了、</p>
<p>（三）勒令歇業　新加坡訊、對海廖内島、爲荷印政府統治下的一地方、其地林木葱鬰、燃料豐富、故本坎華僑柴炭商在廖内島所設的炭窑、不下數百家、但抽稅太重、成本又巨、兼之邇來營業不佳、各商號因均無利可圖、而荷印森林部長、復藉保護森林爲詞、勒令島内所有華商炭窑、統限於六月底關閉、嗣經中國駐新加玻及吧城總領事、向荷印度政府提出抗議、荷方始允審度情勢、通融分做若干時期執行、荷印政府森林官及入息稅官、曾來玻一再會商、華柴炭商以際此商况衰落之時、惟有自動將炭窑收來、所以廖島一巫、龍牙、巫　等地華商炭窑五十家、到期遵令結束一切、自動收盤、聞該業中人云、此次損失至少當在一百萬元、被裁製炭達一萬名太多、其中十分之九爲馬來人、中國人僅占十分之一、該馬來人賦閒後、大都改操漁業生活、華工則只得紛紛遄返中國了、據聞其他華商炭窑五十家、亦經接到荷印政府通告了、儘於本年十二月杪、至明年六月之間、分別撤消、此去華商底損失、華工及馬來人底喪去生活保障、將更趨激劇化了、</p>
<p>其他如錫鑛、樹膠、蔗糖等華商底事業、也莫不同受荷印政府勒令封閉、停割、限制生產等底厄運、華工則更彷徨不知如何才找得出路了、</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>南洋羣島底名詞上、向來是有冠以黃色的南洋底一個形容詞的、從這句話裹、我們可以意識到南洋是十足地表現着黄金的色彩、的確、過去的南洋是充滿着陶醉人們底媚態、我們底華僑、在南洋底經濟上、却也曾建築起了燦煌的宮殿、所以我們底華僑、一向是看南洋做世外的「安樂窩」的、南洋是向來不懂得有什麼呌做不景氣的、除非在歐戰爆發後、因爲受了軍事的影響、有些商品不能輸入、頗感缺乏、和有些貨物不能輸去、頗感過剩、少少發現了一個不景氣底徹結罷了、</p>
<p>但是到了現在、因爲資本主義充分地發展到第三時期底金融資本的最後階段、世界底經濟、尤其是產業先進國民底經濟、就發生了空前的大底不景氣、荷東東印度同在這不景氣底愁雲密集之下、於是貨物因無去路而限制出產、商店因無生意可做而關閉、人民因失了職業而無購買力、關稅因出入口貨品降落而降落、政府因政費支絀而行緊縮政策、和舉發公債以度日、民生底困苦、不一而足、而我華僑在這愁雲慘霧底下面、更要宣囂不可終日了、最後、我們可以總結一句</p>
<p>說、我們華僑在南洋荷屬東印度等處底黃金時代、已經掠了過去了、</p>
<h3>八打威的紅河　斌存</h3>
<p>荷屬八打威Batavia（或呌做吧城、或呌做巴達維亞、）地方那裹、有一條河呌做紅河、這一條河所以會命名做紅河的原因、是由於華僑曾在這裹在荷蘭帝國主義鐵蹄下做犧牲品「血流成渠、」流了無數量的鮮血、染得這條河通紅的結果、</p>
<p>本人曾因在地一家華字日報的聘請、一度到去八打威、那裹的友人們告訴我、在虜清乾隆的時代、荷蘭殖民地政府要強迫我們在她東印度的華僑、繳納一種苛刻的捐稅、在八打威的華僑以不堪荷人的剖削、熾熱了民族底意識起來反對、荷政府就縱兵虐殺華僑、在地華僑集合攏來與之抗爭的結果、華僑被他們慘殺了數萬人、紅血滔天噴出了、這條紅河就成了荷屬華僑歷史上最重要的一頁了、荷兵有了銳利的槍械、又有政府做後盾、自然佔了便官了、我們華僑呢、當前旣沒有軍器做戰鬬的工具、在後復沒有政府做聲援、自然要遭失敗的命運而含仇莫報了、</p>
<p>荷蘭政府以殺了華僑太慘太多了、自已也有點害怕啓了置端起來、於是派使到了清廷謝罪、照恒理來推、清廷必要大興問罪之師、與之論長短了、那裹知道清廷的報詞、「海外奸細、非大清子民、格殺莫論、朝廷向不過問、」荷人得了這樣一個回報、是以就愈肆他們殘殺的辣手段而無懼了、</p>
<p>華僑全敗望絕、敵焰且愈熾烈、就不免生同歸於盡的恐怖心了、於是相率斷指易服、矯作土人、與土人同居、以避荷兵的邏弋、久而久之、與土人同化、而忘其爲中華民族的人了、就是他們本身的籍貫姓氏、也不能自知、偶然有人問之、茫然不能對、這種情形、爪哇各地容易引例此事煞可憫了、荷人的慘殺我華僑、固可痛了、而清廷的棄我華僑也怪可恨了、</p>
<p>現在國内的狀況可不同了、我們黨治下的國民政府很關心海外華僑的痛苦而要思所以解决的方案的、—八打威的華僑、應知怎樣精神團結一致、以我們鮮血所成的紅河、來灌溉漑在地華僑的血花、使八打威永爲我們華僑移民的樂園、</p>

<p>說是本書的理論根據、」告訴讀者以日本爲什麼說是佔着「帝國主義侵略中國史」的最多篇幅、著者的意見是、</p>
<p>一、日本侵略中國的原因有六、（一）日本六十年來的人口過剩、逼着他開拓領土和向外移民、於是到地廣人口比較稀的中國來了、（二）耕地過少的日本因爲米榖不能隨着人口增殖而增加、遂有了糧食缺乏的恐慌、於是侵略物產豐盛的我國了、（三）日本爲欲资本獲利、產業發達、於是想擬取這人烟稠密幅員廣大的中國、以爲其商品銷售的惟一市場、（四）志在奪取中國的原料品如煤鐵大豆棉花羊毛之類、（五）日本欲將其過剩的資本積極的向中國投資、以獵取最大的利潤、因爲這種種的原因、日本「不能不於某種程度内、剝削中國利益、損害中國社會、奪取中國政治權力、」而且最近更進一步兼併中國領土了、</p>
<p>二、日本侵略中國的政策、作者列舉四種、（一）大陸進取政策、「目的完全是欲佔領朝鮮於滿洲、建設一個大陸帝國、」現在的事實表現、作者不幸而言中了、（二）海洋進取政策、（三）強硬對華政策、（四）柔軟對華政策、「帝國主義是殺人不見血的劊子手、」這種種陰險手段、懦弱的中國</p>
<p>外交豈是他的對手、「所以我們欲求中國的解放、祇有以中華民族自己的力量、拿血和肉做代去換取、莫再向日内瓦或巴黎延頸而企待罷、</p>

<p>(Beiping) Zhang Xueliang declared yesterday that a reporter from a Japanese newspaper stationed in Shanghai reported that Japanese military authorities claimed that Japanese troops had withdrawn to the east of the Liao River, and that Chinese troops were disguised as bandits to disrupt the rear of the Japanese army. Unless the Chinese troops in Jinzhou withdraw to within the Guanzhong, a serious situation will occur. Their purpose is to deceive the world in order to expel the last government of the Chinese central government in Manchuria from Manchuria. The fact that China has not concentrated troops in Jinzhou and that the Chinese authorities have not utilized bandits has been clearly understood by the League of Nations and neutral inspectors. If an incident occurs in Jinzhou, the Japanese side should bear full responsibility. (14th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Losses in Postal and Telegraph Services in Northeast Provinces</h3>
<p>No Less Than 400,000 to 500,000 Per Month</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to transportation circles, before September 18th, the postal and telegraph institutions in the Northeast were under the command of the Northeast Transportation Committee, while the administrative functions of the post offices were directly under the Postal Administration. Since the Japanese forcibly occupied the Northeast, the telegraph bureaus in Shenyang, Changchun, Heilongjiang, Harbin, and other places have been directly controlled by the local maintenance committees and indirectly managed by the Japanese. In addition to the Japanese military sending personnel to inspect the postal and telegraph services, anyone who reveals the local economic, transportation, or social situation will have their information withheld, and the sender and addressee will be investigated. Furthermore, the Northeast International Radio Station was seized by the Japanese as a tool for international propaganda. Orders from Nanjing to Shenyang and the dissemination of news from the Japanese military in Shenyang to Japanese embassies and consulates in various places are all carried out through this station. Japanese passenger mail is also being expanded. Japanese passenger mail from Shenyang to various places along the South Manchuria Railway is ubiquitous, and Japanese stamps are used everywhere. The Japanese use their military power to force the Chinese people to use Japanese stamps, otherwise all letters will be withheld. According to informal statistics, the losses in postal and telegraph services in the Northeast amount to no less than 400,000 to 500,000 yuan per month, and about 6 million yuan per year.

<h3>Japanese Businesses in Major Chinese Ports Declining</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The bases of Japanese merchants in China, excluding the Northeast, include Hankou, Shanghai, Nanjing, Tianjin, Beiping, Xiamen, Fuzhou, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Jiujiang, Wuhu, Hangzhou, Jinan, Qingdao, Yantai, and other places. The annual operating conditions of Japanese companies at various ports, whether retail or wholesale, range from approximately 5 million to 80 million Chinese yuan. Based on an average calculation of 10 million yuan per year per location, the annual loss is about 150 million yuan. According to current investigations, Japanese businesses in Chongqing have all closed down, and half of those in Nanjing have closed down. Although others such as Shanghai, Wuhu, Jiujiang, Hankou, Jinan, Qingdao, and Yantai are still open, few people patronize them. The operations of the Mitsubishi, Mitsui, and Yokohoma Specie Bank, have largely absorbed Chinese capital. If the economic isolation continues for three to five months, Japanese businesses will likely be cut off. (14th Dispatch)</p>

What is currently being considered is the government's hope to hand over the full amount within the year, so as to use it as a turnover for the original amount of financial expenditures. However, the banking community believes that raising a large amount of money is quite difficult due to the year-end accounting relationship, and they are currently making every effort to plan. It is heard that there will definitely be a certain amount, because the amount that the Ministry of Finance has overdrawn from certain banks is also expected to be deducted from this public bond.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Japan Implements Gold Re-Embargo (I)</h3>
<p>The Japanese Minseito (Constitutional Democratic Party) cabinet has stepped down, and the Seiyukai (Friends of Constitutional Government) has formed a new cabinet. Its first policy is to implement the gold re-embargo. This is in stark contrast to the past when the Minseito's Hamaguchi cabinet implemented the gold standard upon taking office as its first policy.</p>
<p>The gold standard was one of the Minseito's policy platforms. The Hamaguchi cabinet, with resolute measures and regardless of everything, firmly implemented it. Its initial intention was to recognize the only key to saving the "economic recession." However, what was the result? Throughout the Minseito's cabinet term, it was tormented by a deepening and widening recession. Hamaguchi was ultimately buried by the recession. Now the Seiyukai cabinet has resolutely implemented the gold re-embargo. At times lifting the ban, at times re-imposing it, it is almost like a magician manipulating his kaleidoscope, leaving people unable to grasp it. But no matter how the manipulator of this kaleidoscope flaunts his skillful methods, the unrestrained tide of the current overall capitalist economic system shaking and collapsing in Japan has stirred up unprecedented commotion and terror. All politicians are overwhelmed and at a loss as to how to cope. This is a concrete and unwavering fact. Economist John Maynard Keynes once said, "We are trapped in an inextricable maze today because we are truly misguided in handling a flexible machine (the capitalist economic machine). We do not understand the laws of this machine at all." Japan's gold standard and gold re-embargo precisely show that the heads of Japan's propertied class are at a loss as to how to cope with the current tide of capitalist panic and shaking. They stand in a state of bewilderment on the political scene of panic, playing their bewildering and chaotic farce.</p>
<p>The main reason for Japan's implementation of the gold re-embargo this time is the overall depression of the world economy. Due to the influence of the global economic downturn, Japan, which is in the chain of the world economy, is trapped in a deep abyss of extreme recession. Industrial decline, falling prices, sharp reductions in overseas trade, and a surge in the unemployed masses. This fact has had a tremendous impact on Japan's industrial capital class. Once the Seiyukai, with industrial capital, landlords, and militarists as its background, regains power, it will resolutely implement the gold re-embargo from the standpoint of saving industrial decline. This has already revealed its indications in the phenomena of the former Finance Minister Inoue, representing the interests of financial assets such as Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Yasuda, and Sumitomo banks, strongly opposing the re-embargo, and Mutō Sanji, representing the interests of industrial assets such as the textile industry, supporting the re-embargo.</p>
<p>Secondly, since Japan relaxed the gold embargo, its outflow of specie has increased sharply, while its specie reserves have decreased sharply. Maintaining overseas exchange rates and consolidating the domestic credit base are mutually exclusive and irreconcilable. According to the Bank of Japan's Weekly Report issued on November 11, its reserve ratio to banknotes has been reduced to 49.5%. The rapid outflow of specie has caused a great crisis in the Japanese exchange system. Therefore, the gold re-embargo is a necessary phenomenon that arises in response to the times. However, the Seiyukai's implementation of this policy is not purely for the benefit of financial capital classes in improving exports and imports, but solely for the sake of saving the declining and sluggish industries for the benefit of its own class, and is knocking on its wishful abacus.</p>
<p>Furthermore, since Great Britain suddenly announced the temporary suspension of the gold standard, the gold pound fell sharply by 20%. It gained considerable improvement in overseas trade, especially in the transportation industry, causing great competitive losses to Japan's overseas trade and shipping companies. The expulsion of Japanese textiles from the Indian market is clear evidence of this. In our country, the outbreak of the Northeast Incident has triggered an unprecedented wave of nationwide boycotts of Japanese goods, causing Japan, which has always had an import surplus, to plummet in trade. Even the once prosperous textile industry is now in an irredeemable state. Japan is a country that is founded on light industry. Since it has suffered such a huge threat in light industry, it cannot but cause the anxiety and terror of the industrial asset class, which is urgently planning countermeasures to save itself. Prohibiting gold exports can immediately cause the value of currency to fall and prices to rise. Furthermore, due to the decline in currency value, it can reduce its production costs to compete with the Great Britain, which has stopped the gold standard, for overseas markets, and disrupt our country's boycott of Japanese goods movement. Therefore, the greatest function of the gold re-embargo lies in the Seiyukai's desire to start by restoring overseas trade and competing for overseas markets in order to restore its declining and sluggish industries. The so-called "measures to break the recession" are special secret words and sweet words to deceive other large numbers of Japanese people. In fact, the Seiyukai is merely seizing opportunities for the benefit of its own class. It is merely competing for leadership with the Minseito, which represents financial capital. Can the deep and widening recession truly be broken by the gold re-embargo?</p>

<h3>Japan's Inukai Cabinet's Foreign Policy Remains Unchanged</h3>
<p>Decision to Adopt an Active and Forceful Approach Towards China</p>
<p>Abandoning the Previous Cabinet's Tax Increase Plan</p>
<p>Appointing Yamamoto as a Minister Without Portfolio</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 14th - Since Inukai Tsuyoshi formed a purely cabinet, how to adopt foreign and domestic policies has been taken seriously by the nation. According to a certain minister, Prime Minister Inukai will construct a powerful cabinet, repelling those with lenient and gentle attitudes. On the foreign relations side, it will cooperate with the military department to take an independent and strong policy without any room to voice any complaint. It has been heard that if the future parliament has an opposing opinion, they will resolutely implement a dissolution.</p>
<p>Kokumin, Tokyo, 14th - The new Army Minister Araki stated today that concerning the situation in the three northeastern provinces, he will follow suit to continue the policy of the previous Mr. Minami. (Below are telegrams from Dentsu) The actions of the Japanese military during this incident were carried out for peaceful construction. The League of Nations should be thankful and not regarded with doubt. Although domestic institutions and various aspects have taken a cooperative and unified attitude, it can only be said that this is weak. It should be even more decisive and determined to resolve the Manchurian-Mongolian issues that are the lifeline of Japan. In short, at this stage, the only thing that should be done is to move forward. Regarding this point, I have full determination.</p>
<p>Nichiren, Tokyo, 14th - The current government intends to revise the budget of the next year formed by the Wakatsuki cabinet. However, due to the imminent opening of the parliament, there is no room for further deliberation. The provisional policy is to adopt the principles of the previous cabinet's expenditure budget. As for the revenue budget, the current government's plan is as follows: (1) Abandon the previous cabinet's tax increase plan. (2) Change the revenue budget and abolish the tax increase. (3) Conduct financial and tax consolidation to offset each other's expenses, and make up for the shortfall by issuing public bonds.</p>
<p>Nichiren, Tokyo, 14th - Minister of Colonial Affairs, Hata, declared on the evening of the 13th that the Ministry of Colonial Affairs has decided to revive and should carry out fundamental reforms. The province's policy towards Manchuria has always been in line with the military department's established policy.</p>
<p>Kokumin, Tokyo, 14th - The new Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi has decided to hold cabinet meetings every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. At today's cabinet meeting this afternoon, it was decided to appoint Yamamoto Jotaro as a minister without portfolio to assist in national affairs. However, at a time when the Seiyukai is busily reorganizing the government, leaders of the Minseito who are still loyal to Wakatsuki have threatened that after the parliament convenes, they may raise the gold embargo issue again and propose a motion of no confidence in the government, demanding a vote to determine the outcome.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 14th - The Minseito is still wavering and undecided, so it has not yet begun to formulate countermeasures for the parliament. However, with the session approaching, it is necessary to quickly prepare and face the parliament. Secretary-General Raibo visited Prime Minister Wakatsuki yesterday to report on party affairs and reached an agreement. As for the content of the report, Prime Minister Inukai's next-year budget generally follows the policies of the Minseito. Except for the ban on gold exports, there are no major issues that can be directly opposed, and dissolution may be avoided. However, on the other hand, after the parliament reopens, there is also a strong opinion to submit a vote of no confidence in order to dissolve the parliament. Therefore, an executive meeting will be held soon to discuss the fundamental policy towards the parliament. Once the party has calmed down, it will face the parliament with dignity and correctness as an opposition party.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 14th - The Financial Times stated that Japan's competitiveness has been greatly affected since the United Kingdom suspended the gold standard, and now it has no choice but to abolish the gold standard as well. The diplomatic correspondent for the Morning Post stated that the Wakatsuki government's resignation was the result of conflict with the Ministry of the Army. The success of Japan's Manchurian policy, as expressed at the Paris Conference, was due to the power of the Ministry of the Army, not the power of the cabinet. It is expected that there will be better cooperation on policy between the new cabinet and the military authorities, and the government can maintain its appropriate authority. The Times newspaper said in its editorial today that although the new Japanese government did not approve of the policies of former Finance Minister Inoue, it cannot abolish his thrifty policy, because the current state of world trade and finance does not allow waste. Takahashi's long-term finance is probably Saionji's desire to maintain public trust both domestically and internationally in Japan's financial stability. The Inukai Tsuyoshi cabinet may not be overthrown by the existing parliament, but its future is also very dangerous, and its proposed five-year plan will eventually give the opposition party the opportunity to regain power. There will be no changes in the new cabinet's foreign policy, and it is expected that Japan's national unity will not be broken.</p>
<h3>Japan Reinstates Gold Embargo</h3>
<p>Stock Market Prices Soar</p>
<p>All Exchanges Suspended</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 14th - After the stock exchange opened today, people were excited and the prices of various securities soared. Whether this kind of price increase is reasonable is still unknown. However, the authorities believe that suspending the exchange is more beneficial because it can curb speculation and wait for a calmer atmosphere. Therefore, after only a short period of trading this morning, all stock markets across the country were temporarily suspended. It is expected that the Tokyo Stock Exchange will be closed for two days. After the market opened this morning, the price of a certain security soared by as much as 60 yuan. The new Minister of Finance, Takahashi, told reporters this afternoon about the suspension of the stock exchange, saying that the authorities are prepared to adopt any plan that the situation requires. However, he believes that there is no need for officials to speak out to calm the current surging market sentiment because this kind of surge will naturally subside soon. However, the people should not anticipate the rise in prices and engage in any extravagant behavior.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 14th - The Yokohama Specie Bank decided today not to issue exchange rate lists, and market exchange rates are also unavailable. However, the Kobe Holland Bank quoted an exchange rate of 36 to 37.5 US dollars per 100 Japanese yen for US dollars, and 2 shillings and 1.5 pence to 2 shillings and 2.5 pence per 100 Japanese yen for British gold. The Japanese government is now allowing the Yokohama Specie Bank to ship 30 million Japanese yen to the United States tomorrow because it needs to pay for US dollars sold abroad. Japan's gold reserves are now less than 500 million yuan.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 14th - As a result of the re-implementation of the gold embargo, Japanese public bonds fell by 2 to 5 pounds sterling today. However, because sellers were not seen to be crowding, the buy prices within the lower range remained firm. In addition, the stock exchange was not significantly affected. The initial exchange rate for Japanese gold was set at 27 pence, but the prices at which deals were made varied greatly.</p>
<p>Nichiren, Tokyo, 14th - The government announced the gold export ban on the 13th, and at the same time ordered the suspension of gold exchange. Upon receiving this report, more than 300 people waited in front of the Bank of Japan gate this morning. The bank authorities decided on an emergency policy to refuse exchanges of more than 50 yuan.</p>
<p>Nichiren, Tokyo, 14th - The Yokohama Specie Bank originally planned to transport cash to the United States on the 14th and 15th of this month. Last night, the current cabinet suddenly issued a gold export ban. As a result of discussions between Deputy Governor Fukai of the Bank of Japan and Finance Minister Takahashi last night, it was decided to proceed with the planned gold shipment to the United States.</p>
<p>Kokumin, New York, 13th - It has just been reported from Wall Street that the price of silver will experience speculative increases due to the impact of Japan's gold ban. However, it is difficult for the rise in silver prices to be sustained because it is difficult to expect silver-using countries to immediately promote the improvement of their economic status. Japan's behavior of re-implementing the gold ban did not cause panic in the New York market, and it is expected that Japanese silk will be able to be exported in the future. Many believe that the reason for Japan's re-implementation of the gold ban is to lower the price of the Japanese currency slightly in order to restore Japan's market in the East, so as to compete with British goods.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 14th - The new Finance Minister Takahashi issued a statement last night regarding the gold export ban in the form of a conversation, saying that the re-prohibition of gold exports has a significant impact on the daily lives of the people, but it is an unavoidable measure in these extraordinary times. It is hoped that it will be carried out sacrificially. Because of the re-prohibition, there will naturally be people who benefit, and these behaviors are certainly not good in moral terms. However, since business freedom is permitted, there is no way to stop it. The government has no other way but to find ways to reduce it. It is still difficult to predict whether it will be re-liberalized at a new parity price in the future, or whether it will be carried out permanently. However, the government's purpose in re-banning gold exports is to suppress imports, increase exports, and improve international lending relationships, while at the same time revitalizing domestic industries. However, the exchange market may be shaken as a result, which is quite difficult. However, it should be stabilized by the Specie Bank and other banks through adjustment. The government is unwilling to implement artificial sanctions.</p>
<h3>America Stops Receiving Overdue War Debts</h3>
<p>Kokuminsha, Washington, 13th - Although President Hoover's plan to suspend war debt and reparations payments for one year has not yet been approved by Congress, the US government has officially abandoned the right to collect 125 million yuan in war debts due on the 15th today. The Ministry of Finance stated that if a government that owes debts to the United States inquires about the status of its debts, the ministry will issue a statement stating that, given the special circumstances of the US Congress, other governments will not be criticized for not paying debts to the United States at this time. Furthermore, according to Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Mills, 68 of the 96 senators and 276 of the 436 representatives have guaranteed to support the suspension plan.</p>
<h3>Engineers from the Capital Plan an Agricultural Trust</h3>
<p>Kokuminsha, Geneva, 13th - The League of Nations authorities recently declared that if the world's eight major agricultural countries can jointly organize a trust, with the prices of agricultural products in various countries determined by it, the world's economic crisis can be resolved immediately. Therefore, the Joint Association of Capital Engineers, led by Podabers, has presented this idea to the League of Nations authorities. The main points of the proposal can be listed as follows: (1) The world's population is approximately 185 million, of which 85 million are directly engaged in agriculture, 70 million are in the industrial sector, and the remaining 30 million are indirectly dependent on agriculture and industry for their livelihoods. (2) Farmers now have almost no profit to be made. (3) Because farmers have little profit, they are unable to purchase manufactured goods. (4) Because manufactured goods cannot be sold well, workers are unable to purchase agricultural products. (5) Therefore, the only solution is to enable farmers to enjoy surplus profits, so that they can purchase manufactured goods. Then, import and export businesses can immediately return to their original state, and the world can hope to return to its former prosperity. This is the plan for agricultural countries to organize a trust to independently set agricultural product prices.</p>

<h3>American Sailors Riot in Honolulu</h3>
<p>Japanese People Unreasonably Abused</p>
<p>Kokuminsha, Honolulu, 13th - American sailors in Pearl Harbor accused five people of gang-raping the wife of a naval officer. After questioning by the court, the jurors failed to agree. Hundreds of sailors then acted freely. After the Marine Corps and the Naval Land Patrol surrounded them and ordered them to return to their ships, the riot was resolved. One of the five defendants was Japanese, and he was dragged to the top of a cliff by sailors, severely beaten, and almost pushed off the cliff. Finally, a passerby sent him to the hospital. Sailors are now temporarily prohibited from going ashore on leave, and any sailors seen in the streets will be escorted back to their ships.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Honjo Sends Itagaki to Persuade Ma Zhanshan</h3>
<p>Ma Zhanshan's Attitude is Firm</p>
<p>Itagaki Returns Without Success</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence, on the 6th of this month, Itagaki, the Chief of Staff of the Japanese Kwantung Army Command, on the orders of Honjo Shigeru, came to Harbin from Shenyang. Those traveling with him included Fukushima, a translator from the Kwantung Army, accountant Sometomiya, and reporters from British and German newspapers, a total of five people. They stayed at the North Manchuria Hotel in Daoli. At noon, they went to see Zhang Jinghui for a very secret consultation. After 1:00 PM, Itagaki took a plane to Heihe. Returning to Harbin at about 3:00 PM, the Japanese troops on the Qiqihar line had already advanced to the Tahaer and Yangguantun areas. Due to Itagaki's arrival, they all stopped in the local area and no longer advanced. The situation on the Qiqihar line suddenly eased. That evening, Itagaki went to Zhang Jinghui's private residence and invited Zhao Zhongren, a Chinese traitor from Heihe Province, to come. The three parties talked for a long time. At about 8:00 PM, Zhang Jinghui, at the request of Itagaki, spoke to Ma Zhanshan on a long-distance call. Zhang said that the representative of the Japanese Kwantung Army will go to Hailun to meet with Xiufang (Ma's courtesy name), and will go tomorrow. Please send someone to receive them. Ma said that he did not need to negotiate directly with the Japanese, and the soldiers and people of Heihe Province were full of energy. Please do not come, otherwise accidents may happen, and he will not be responsible. Itagaki put his ear to the receiver and wanted to talk to Ma directly, but Ma did not answer and hung up the phone. At about 8:00 AM on the 7th, Itagaki, along with translator Fukushima and consulate staff Okado and Sugiyama, went to Ma's pier in Songpu. Accompanied by Zhao Zhongren and Han Shoupeng (former secretary of the Heihe Provincial Government), they first called Hailun from Ma's pier, requesting Ma Zhanshan to allow Itagaki to meet him at all costs. Ma unwillingly ordered a railcar to be called on the Hulan-Hailun line, and invited reporters from Chinese newspapers in Harbin to go with them. The meeting was scheduled for 2:00 PM at the Suihua station on the Hulan-Hailun line (117 kilometers from Harbin). At 1:55 PM, the special car carrying Itagaki arrived in Suihua. He then received a call from Hailun, stating that Suihua was inconvenient and that the meeting would be held in Hailun. Zhao Zhongren, Han Shoupeng, and the reporters took a car first. At 4:30 PM, Itagaki's car departed. Arriving in Hailun at 8:00 PM that night, an aide-de-camp from the Joint Military-Political Office escorted them to stay at Guangxin. Chinese and foreign reporters stayed at the Yitaiyong Trading Company. At 9:00 PM that night, Ma sent Chief of Staff Xie Ke to meet with Itagaki first and inquire about his intentions. Itagaki explained that he represented Commander Honjo and wanted to meet with Chairman Ma for a face-to-face talk. At 12:00 PM, Ma, along with Zhao Zhongren, Han Shoupeng, Xie Ke, and two translators, met at the Joint Military-Political Office in Guangxin. After meeting, Itagaki first said, "I represent Commander Honjo and have come to see Your Excellency for several matters to discuss." While speaking, he took out Honjo's business card from his sleeve (on which were written the characters "Please convey my regards to Chairman Ma"). He said that Commander Honjo ordered him to ask Your Excellency three questions: First, what is Your Excellency's current attitude and will you continue to resist the Japanese army to the end? Please answer clearly. Second, the conflict between the Heihe army and the Japanese army this time was a temporary misunderstanding. Can military actions be stopped in the future and can there be mutual understanding? Third, what are Your Excellency's thoughts on the previous battles? What the Japanese side now requests from Your Excellency is: (1) to preserve the peace of East Asia, so that no more wars will occur between China and Japan; (2) that China and Japan can thoroughly cooperate in businesses such as maintaining the security of the Northeast. The Kwantung Army respects Your Excellency's intentions and hopes to end the anti-Japanese actions and fully understand the Kwantung Army's true intentions. If military actions are stopped immediately, then Your Excellency can still be responsible for the military power of Heihe Province and mutually safeguard the peace of East Asia, because the Kwantung Army will never allow anti-Japanese actions to continue to exist in the Northeast. There is a complete plan and great determination to completely transform the future. As for the Hulan and Qiqihar lines, because of admiration for Your Excellency's bravery, the military plan will not be implemented immediately," etc. Ma replied, "Your representative's first request is what I have always prayed for, and the second item can also be agreed upon, but Chinese sovereignty must be respected, and there must be sincere goodwill. The military actions taken by the Heilongjiang army this time were purely for self-defense. I was appointed by the central government and do not know anything else. I hope that all disputes between China and Japan will be resolved as soon as possible, which is my deep wish. As for the actions of our army and our future attitude, your side should already be clear about it, so there is no need to state it again. In short, if the Japanese army does not oppress us, we will not attack." That night, during the conversation between the two parties, Itagaki constantly tempted Ma with benefits, forcefully arguing how strong the Japanese army was and how isolated the Heihe army was, and that resistance was useless, repeatedly pestering him until 2:35 AM on the 8th before bidding farewell and leaving. At 11:00 AM on the 8th, Itagaki visited Ma again, requesting Ma to go to Harbin to talk with Zhang Jinghui, and promising Ma to be the military and political assistant of Heilongjiang, with Zhang Jinghui serving as the chairman. If Ma was willing to agree, the Japanese army would withdraw from the Qiqihar line and no longer pressure him. Ma said that he did not object to Zhang Jinghui being the chairman of Heilongjiang, as they are both Chinese. However, he was appointed by the central government and could not secretly hand over the position. Harbin and Hailun are not far apart, and they can often discuss matters by telephone and do not need to go in person. The public sentiment in Hailun is extremely激昂, and it is best that representatives of your country do not come again in the future. Seeing that Ma's attitude was firm, Itagaki returned to Harbin today, dejected. It is heard that he is scheduled to return to Shenyang tonight to report back. (9th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Embassy Releases Stimson's Remarks on the Manchurian Issue</h3>
<p>Endorsing the Principles Contained in the League of Nations Resolution</p>
<p>Still Concerned About All Future Developments in This Matter</p>
<p>Reuters, Peiping, 12th. The U.S. Embassy received the declaration made by U.S. Secretary of State Stimson to the press on December 10 regarding the Sino-Japanese dispute in Manchuria. The translation is as follows: "The U.S. Government is very pleased that the Council of the League of Nations unanimously passed the resolution of December 10. This is a definite step in the long and difficult negotiation process carried out by Briand and his colleagues with great perseverance. The Council of the League of Nations convened on September 18, just as the Manchurian Incident occurred. China immediately invoked Article 11 of the League Covenant to petition the Council. China and Japan both participated in the Council's discussions in accordance with their obligations as signatories to the Covenant. The U.S. Government has strived to cooperate with the Council from the beginning and has supported its efforts. Therefore, it has sent notes to the governments of China and Japan through diplomatic channels. The League of Nations' efforts to prevent major wars and seek a peaceful resolution of the Manchurian case are not only of concern to the American people, but the U.S. Government is also directly involved and obligated under the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the Nine-Power Treaty of February 6, 1922, both of which it co-signed with China and Japan. This resolution stipulates the immediate cessation of hostilities, reiterates Japan's solemn promise to withdraw its troops into the railway zone as soon as possible, and provides for the dispatch of a commission of five investigators to conduct on-site investigations and report to the Council of the League of Nations on any circumstances that disrupt peace and good understanding between China and Japan. The provision for a neutral commission is crucial and is an organized step towards a final and fair resolution of the complex Manchurian issue. It is a new era of enlightened methods for implementing reconciliation of this problem, as recognized by both China and Japan. The principles it contains exist in many treaties of amity signed by the United States and have occupied a prominent position in the world's constructive peace mechanisms in recent years. The work of this type of commission can reduce the heat of the dispute and allow for a careful study of the underlying issues. The final resolution of the Manchurian case must be achieved by China and Japan themselves through an agreement. What concerns the United States is that the methods used in this resolution should comply with the obligations of the treaties we have signed and should not endanger world peace. The result must not be obtained through the oppression of force. These are the principles advocated by the United States and the countries attending the Council of the League of Nations. However, the adoption of this resolution cannot be regarded as an endorsement of any actions taken in Manchuria to date. The U.S. Government, as a signatory to the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the Nine-Power Treaty, cannot deliberately ignore the events that have occurred. The future effectiveness of the resolution depends entirely on the good faith of both sides in fulfilling their promise to oppose further warfare and on the spirit of utilizing the various provisions to achieve a final resolution. In view of the obligations of the treaties it has signed, the U.S. Government will continue to be deeply concerned about all future developments in this matter."</p>
<h3>Japanese Dissatisfaction with the Actions of the Warlords</h3>
<p>Concerned that They Will Invite Suspicion from the Great Powers</p>
<p>But the Japanese Warlords Still Want to Go Their Own Way</p>
<p>The Greater America Evening News, Shenyang, 13th. Tsurumi, the son-in-law of the late Count Goto, is known for his familiarity with Japanese-American relations. After touring and lecturing in the United States for a year, he came to Liaoning to inspect the situation in the three eastern provinces. In a speech in Dalian, he discussed former U.S. Army Chief of Staff Pershing's criticism of the actions of the Japanese army in the Northeast, saying that the financial and economic recovery of the United States, Britain, and Germany and the completion of the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan are not far off. Japan must immediately focus on eliminating the root causes of existing foreign misunderstandings. Mr. Tsurumi also recounted the history of U.S.-Japan relations since the Russo-Japanese War, saying that the Twenty-One Demands made by Japan to China in 1915 greatly damaged U.S.-Japan relations, and that the anti-foreign land law in California further deepened this damage. After the Washington Conference, U.S.-Japan relations improved, and the United States' fear of Japanese aggression against China was somewhat allayed, but this military action has increased American suspicion again, etc. This speech has attracted great attention from the Japanese community here, because the Japanese have also expressed their dissatisfaction with the arrogance of the military. Consul General Hayashi has also tried to organize a committee that can represent the greater interests of the Japanese community in the three eastern provinces and place the military in a secondary position in order to unify the goals and policies of the Japanese in Manchuria. Mr. Hayashi returned to Tokyo for several days and only returned to Shenyang this afternoon for this matter, but it is heard that the Japanese warlords do not approve of this plan. They issued a declaration here today, claiming that the Japanese army has its own plan to maintain the Open Door Policy and world investment in Manchuria and Mongolia.</p>
<h3>Memorial Week of the National Government</h3>
<p>Cai Yuanpei Speaks on the Mission of the Special Education Committee</p>
<p>The National Government held a memorial week for the late Premier Sun Yat-sen on the morning of the 14th. Chiang Kai-shek, Cai Yuanpei, Yu Youren, Zhu Peide, Shao Lizi, Ma Fuxiang, Li Shuhua, Chen Qicai, He Yaozu, Ru Yuli, Wei Daoming, Chen Shaokuan, Yu Feipeng, Zhu Luhe, and other staff members, totaling more than 400 people, attended. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek led the ceremony, followed by a report by Cai Yuanpei on the mission of the Special Education Committee. He briefly stated that educational administration is the responsibility of the Ministry of Education, but the Central Political Council believes that there are various special issues in education during this time of national crisis that require collective wisdom. Therefore, a special committee was established, and there is absolutely no infringement on the powers of the Ministry of Education. When talking about special issues in education during the national crisis, one thinks of the patriotic movement of students. The patriotic movement of students is most welcome, but if academic studies are sacrificed due to the patriotic movement, the loss is significant, and the harm is almost equal to the loss of territory. During the European War, Germany's finances were extremely exhausted, but schools were not closed because students are the lifeline of the country. Famous scholars in countries with conscription systems can be exempted from military service because academic studies are the reserve force of the military, and the resources of youth cannot be easily sacrificed. Germany has Krupp, who can make the country's ordnance the best in the world. France has Pasteur, who can make the brewing and silk industries particularly stable, greatly increasing national wealth. The United States has Edison, who can create countless sources of profit for the United States. Moreover, during times of national crisis, it is an opportunity to promote creation. Our country now needs inventors like Krupp, Pasteur, and Edison. With a seven-year illness, seeking artemisia for three years can still save our poverty and weakness. If we continue to procrastinate, it will be incurable. If young people engage in patriotic movements by giving speeches on the current situation during their spare time or expressing their opinions in writing, it will be beneficial and harmless. Now, young people emphasize strikes and marches, and some travel thousands of miles to the capital to protest, sacrificing time and studies. Among these tens of thousands of young people, there may be several inventors or a few great inventors like Pasteur and Edison. It is truly pitiful and regrettable that they sacrifice a lot of time and studies when they are young. Now, patriotic young people, motivated by patriotic enthusiasm, mistakenly believe that the original basic sciences are not a way to save the country. We now need to examine the school curriculum to see if there are any subjects that can be temporarily reduced and replaced with textbooks that are directly related to the national crisis. The most direct is naturally military training. This was originally requested by students in various places. Now, why are students in various places sacrificing the time to receive training and exchanging it for running around? Is it necessary to intensify the current military training? That is why we set up a military training group and asked military experts to study this issue. Secondly, the current situation, the comparison of the strengths of various countries, and the various preparations that should be made in terms of national defense, economy, and transportation all contain many issues. If experts give detailed lectures, it will not only boost morale but also be beneficial to the present and the future. That is why we set up a special lecture group, not only to consult with the existing teachers in various schools but also to invite famous scholars to give lectures in various places in turn. We set up a compilation and translation group to collect and organize materials for special lectures. We set up a general affairs group to take care of the patriotic activists who have arrived in Beijing, so as to reduce difficulties and avoid danger. The above groups are currently temporarily staffed by members appointed by the Political Conference, and specialized scholars will be invited to join them to gather wisdom and broaden ideas. If a national crisis conference is established in the future and there is a section on education, the work of this committee can be transferred, and the committee can be dissolved, etc." The meeting adjourned after the report.</p>
<h3>The Northeast Authorities Transport Salt to Raise Funds</h3>
<p>Establish a Jiyun Committee to Promote the Sales of Lu Salt</p>
<p>Peiping Correspondence. Since the September 18th Incident, troops from the Northeast have gathered in Guannei, and various civilian and military organizations in Shenyang have also moved to Peiping and Tianjin to continue their work as usual. However, the financial resources of the Northeast have long been cut off, and the provinces of Hebei and Jehol are even struggling to take care of themselves. As a result, the troops' salaries and the salaries of various organizations have been supported for months, and they are gradually feeling exhausted. Now that winter is approaching, the soldiers' cotton clothes and cold-weather equipment require a large amount of funds to cope with. Zhang Xueliang is facing great difficulties in this regard. He recently ordered the heads of the finance, salt affairs, and railway bureaus to discuss solutions. After discussion, it was decided to establish a Jiyun Committee to promote the sale of Lu salt in the Yu shore area and raise funds. Gao Jiyi has been appointed as the chairman of the committee, and Lu Muting, Jing Youyan, Zeng Guangxiang, and Jin Zaohua as members. The committee will be established soon, and the address will be located in the Political Affairs Committee. The provisional measures of the committee are as follows: (1) This committee organizes a special train to transport salt to promote the sales of Lu salt and raise funds quickly. (2) In order to encourage salt merchants to compete for transportation, those who report the transportation of salt to the Yu shore within one month from the date of announcement of these measures will be exempted from military donations (currently four yuan per bag). Those who exceed the time limit will pay as usual. (All procedures for salt merchants to report transportation will still be handled by the salt affairs agencies as usual, but after the audit agency issues the permit, the salt merchants shall report to the committee in writing or by telegram within 24 hours, and go to the transportation office to collect the transportation order for verification. (4) The committee accepts the aforementioned report, verifies that it is consistent with the transportation order, immediately registers it, and allocates vehicles for loading in the shortest possible time according to the order. When a train is full, it will be shipped immediately. (5) The railway freight and tax donations for the salt transported with the approval of the committee shall be handled in accordance with the regulations. (6) Salt that is exempt from military donations shall be limited to designated sales in the Yu shore area. (7) All salt transported to the Yu shore area must be delivered directly to the designated sales location, and there must be no scattering or backflow. (8) In addition to salt transported to the Yu shore area, salt merchants in other areas who report transportation within one month will be given priority transportation according to the order of reporting, but they shall not be exempt from donations. (9) When the salt transport vehicles return, they shall transport other urgently needed goods (such as food and fuel) within the scope of not delaying time, but they must be reported to the committee for approval in advance to prevent abuses. (10) If any personnel of the committee engage in corruption, they shall be dealt with in accordance with military law.</p>
<h3>The Fujian Provincial Government Takes Over the Electric Power Company</h3>
<p>All Members of the Anti-Japanese Association Resign</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence. Regarding the opposition to the Electric Power Company and the private sale of Japanese goods by Zhengji Warehouse in Fuzhou, the joint meeting of the Party, government, and military at 2 pm on the 5th resulted in the following: (1) The Electric Power Company will be taken over by a committee organized by the Party, government, military, and business sectors. Gan Yun, a member of the Provincial Party Department, Chen Peikun, Xu Xianshi, Li Dingzhang, commander of martial law, Guo Yongrong, director of the Public Security Bureau, Guo Zeshou, president of the Bank of China, and Luo Mianhou, owner of Henghe Money Shop, were appointed as members on the spot. (2) The Japanese goods in Zhengji Warehouse will be temporarily sealed pending resolution. (3) Liu Chongwei, Liu Chonglun, Lin Tianmin, and Lin Xianmin were wanted and brought to justice. (4) Military and police agencies were ordered to strictly prohibit gatherings, parades, petitions, strikes, and work stoppages. Those who disobey the prohibition will be considered to be disrupting public order and will be detained and prosecuted. After the meeting adjourned, the provincial government issued a public notice to the public at 6 pm. On the 6th, stores and factories opened as usual, and the turmoil came to a halt for a while. At 2 pm on the 7th, the Electric Power Takeover Committee held its first meeting at the Provincial Government. It was decided to elect Xu Xianshi as the chairman of the committee. Xu Xianshi drafted the takeover procedures and measures. Chen Peikun and Gan Yun audited the company's income and expenditure accounts. Guo Zeshou and Luo Mianhou temporarily maintained the company's finances and informed the company's employees by letter to continue working and await further appointments. At the same time, the Anti-Japanese Association also held an emergency meeting and decided that all executive committee members would resign and submit their resignations to the provincial and county Party departments for the assignment of personnel to take over, and ordered all departments to complete the handover by the 8th.

<h3>Fujian Finance Director He Gonggan Resigns</h3>
<p>The Provincial Government Sends Personnel to Take Over the Department's Affairs</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence. Finance Director He Gonggan, unable to cope with the demands from all parties, suddenly took the Huaan ship to Shanghai on the morning of the 6th. Before leaving, he cited the recurrence of his old illness as a reason and asked the provincial government for a two-week leave of absence, with the department's affairs being handled by the secretary-director, Du Luzhong. On the 7th, the provincial government sent Secretary Wu Xianzhang and Chen Weiyao, a member of the Anti-Smoking Committee (former secretary-director of the Finance Department), to the Finance Department to take over. It was found that most of the administrative expenses of the various agencies had only been paid until September, or a portion of October, and the department's bills that had not been paid exceeded 700,000 yuan. The provincial government now plans to clear the bills first and then raise funds to pay the administrative expenses. It has already consulted with Qianbang to mortgage 400,000 yuan from the tea industry business tax for the 21st year. However, Du Luzhong refused to act as an agent because the responsibility of the department's affairs was too great. Therefore, the provincial government plans to order the various secretaries and section chiefs to jointly take responsibility. As for the successor finance director, although there are rumors of many people, it is likely that a decision will be made after Yang Shuzhuang returns to Fujian. (December 9)</p>
<h3>The Fujian Provincial Government Asks to Investigate the Fujian Opium Case</h3>
<p>Denies Zheng Luosheng et al.'s Allegations That the Provincial Government Presided Over Opium Planting</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence. The members of the provincial government, in response to the proposal by Zheng Luosheng et al., representatives of the Fourth Plenary Session, to investigate the opium planting case in Fujian, which claimed that the provincial government was presiding over the matter, held a symposium on the 8th. Yang Shuzhuang, Fang Shengtao, Zheng Baojing, Cheng Shiquan, Xu Xianshi, Chen Peikun, Lin Zhiyuan, Lin Jinan, and Ding Chaowu jointly proposed that the National Government promptly send officials to Fujian to thoroughly investigate in order to clarify the truth. It was decided to telegraph the Central Party Department, the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Military Affairs, the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Finance, and the Anti-Smoking Committee in Nanjing on the 9th, saying, "Reading the newspaper, Zheng Luosheng et al. of the Fourth Plenary Session suggested that the opium planting case in Fujian be thoroughly investigated, saying that officials under the Party's rule openly plant opium and levy taxes, which is truly a break with the Party, the country, and humanity. Righteous and stern words, reading them makes one sweat. The original proposal also stated that opium seedlings in Fujian are most prominent in southern Fujian, and those in charge are the provincial government, and those who help them are the local military and political leaders, and even government officials personally go to supervise the levy, etc., blaming the provincial government, which is even more frightening. At the provincial government meeting on the Geng day, a report was submitted, and all members agreed that although the finances of the Fujian provincial government have been extremely difficult in recent years, it has never used the prohibition of opium to extort a penny from the people, which can be witnessed by heaven and earth. According to recent reports, various counties have resumed planting opium seedlings, which has been strictly prohibited by the provincial government's committee meeting. In accordance with Article 17 of the Anti-Smoking Law, officials who use their power to force others to commit the crime of planting opium shall be sentenced to death. Personnel from the Party, government, and military agencies were dispatched to supervise each other, and a report was submitted to the central government to order all units of the National Defense Army in the province to comply. In fact, it is still early in the season, and if the seedlings are eradicated, it can still be remedied. If the provincial government is negligent, it shall report the truth. As for saying that the provincial government itself presides over opium planting, it is not only a sinner of the Party and the country, but also a public enemy of the people. The names listed in the proposal are mostly Fujianese who are familiar with the facts. If they deliberately add fruit arrows to the provincial government, so that colleagues will wear this overturned pot, the facts are not consistent, and the situation is difficult to remain silent. Now that the Fourth Plenary Session has this proposal, we urgently request that it be thoroughly implemented in accordance with the case, and that officials be selected and sent to Fujian as soon as possible to conduct a strict investigation. If there is any destruction of the opium ban, regardless of military or political, they should be dealt with strictly according to the law and severely punished as a warning to the whole country. The telegram is urgent, and we hope that you will carefully consider it. The Fujian Provincial Government bows its head." (December 10)</p>
<h3>Part of the Illegal Cases of Japan (4)</h3>
<p>"On Managing Manchuria and Mongolia" written by Japanese national Shigeo Hosono: Mr. Shigeo Hosono, a Japanese national, published and distributed "On Managing Manchuria and Mongolia" in the spring of the 17th year [of the Republic of China, i.e., 1928]. Subsequently, a Chinese national, Wang Gongning, translated it into Chinese, titled it "The Japanese Annexation," and published it in Shanghai. Upon receiving the report, we immediately sent letters to our embassy in Japan, requesting them to purchase the original text and to negotiate the matter. Our embassy in Japan replied, stating that the book "On Managing Manchuria and Mongolia" had been read by officials upon its publication. Its wording was absurd, its claims barbaric and deeply reprehensible. They had pointed out the content to the Japanese authorities, requesting them to ban it. However, the Japanese authorities responded that such private writings were purely the expression of personal opinions, and unless they clearly violated laws or regulations, it was not easy to intervene with administrative actions. They also claimed that Hosono was unknown, and an investigation would only attract public attention, which would be like publishing advertisements for him. Despite repeated rebuttals, they maintained their position, and no concrete solution was reached.</p>
<p>The Case of the Japanese Warship "Tanikaze" Killing Fishermen in Pingtan: On the night of February 27th of the 17th year [of the Republic of China, i.e., 1928], the Japanese merchant ship "Kinjo Maru" ran aground and sank in the mist off Geligang, Pingtan, Fujian. Over thirty crew members and their luggage were rescued by a Chinese fishing boat owned by Li [omitted], and they boarded the Japanese warship "Aoi" to return to their country. The next day, when the Pingtan County Magistrate sent officials to investigate, the Japanese warship "Tanikaze" suddenly arrived and, without asking any questions, opened fire on the fishing boats and civilians on the shore, killing twelve people and injuring twenty-seven. In the afternoon, Japanese soldiers landed with weapons and searched houses one by one before leaving. The former Fujian Commissioner for Foreign Affairs lodged a serious protest with the Japanese Consul, declaring that all rights were reserved. The Japanese Consul replied that when the Japanese warship arrived, they saw many boats looting goods, and they opened fire to drive away the pirates, which was a measure that warships should take. The Commissioner refuted this by saying that most of the boats at the time were Chinese fishing boats. He asked what kind of goods they were allegedly looting and how they were doing so. He also pointed out that the fishing boats involved were among those that rescued the crew and their belongings, which was enough to prove that they were all honest fishing boats and not suspected of any crime. He added that the houses of the civilians on the shore were searched one by one afterward, and nothing was found, proving that there was no piracy. Therefore, the civilians who were victims in this incident were all innocent people. He demanded five things: punishment of the perpetrators, compensation to the families of the victims, indemnity, an apology, and a guarantee that this would not happen again. The Japanese Consul replied with a letter that still evaded responsibility and used the irrelevant excuse of pirates. The Commissioner reported the case to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in detail. After careful review, the Ministry found that the reasons given by the Japanese Consul did not match the facts and ordered the Commissioner to refute the Japanese Consul based on the reasons given. The Japanese Consul continued to distort the truth, rely on force, and engage in sophistry, and the case remained unresolved.</p>
<p>The Case of Damage in the Jinan Incident: On May 3rd of the 17th year [of the Republic of China, i.e., 1928], during the Jinan Incident, the casualties among Chinese soldiers and civilians and the loss of public and private property could not be investigated at the time because Jinan was occupied by Japanese military force. According to reports from various public and private sources, the statistics are as follows: (A) Regarding casualties, over 17,000 people died, over 3,000 people were injured, over 9,000 were either dead or injured (the original report did not distinguish between deaths and injuries), over 5,000 were captured, and over 280 were missing (disappeared). (B) Regarding property losses, (1) public property was valued at over 11.3 million yuan, and the value of items not yet valued was pending investigation and estimation. (2) Private property was valued at over 21.8 million yuan, and the value of items not yet valued was pending investigation and estimation. The above figures are based only on reports already received and statistically compiled. The total damage is probably several times greater than this. On March 28th of the 18th year [of the Republic of China, i.e., 1929], the Jinan Incident was resolved. Regarding the issue of damages, the protocol stated that each side would appoint an equal number of commissioners to establish a joint investigation committee to conduct on-site investigations and make decisions. At that time, it was agreed with the Japanese ambassador to appoint three commissioners each. The list of personnel appointed by our side was notified to the Japanese ambassador in June of that year. The Japanese side has not yet notified us of the appointment of an equal number of commissioners. A letter was sent again in May of the 19th year [of the Republic of China, i.e., 1930], but there was no response.</p>
<p>Japan Plans to Set Up Manchuria and Mongolia Pavilion at the Exposition: In September of the 17th year [of the Republic of China, i.e., 1928], an exposition was held in Nagoya. The city's news and communications [omitted] agency opened a major news conference and established a Manchuria and Mongolia Pavilion, placing it in the category of Japanese territories. This concerned the encroachment on China's sovereignty. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs cabled the Chinese ambassador in Japan to investigate and verify the facts and [omitted] protest. According to the reply, after careful investigation, the pavilion did exist. At the same time, the same situation existed in Kyoto. The ambassador protested to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which said that it was only a display of exhibits and that there was no intention of regarding Manchuria and Mongolia as Japanese colonies. After repeated debates, they agreed to change the name to "Participation Pavilion." In March of the 19th year [of the Republic of China, i.e., 1930], the Executive Yuan ordered that attention be paid to the Japanese rewarding aggression towards Manchuria and Mongolia and that steps be taken to establish a Manchuria and Mongolia Pavilion in Tokyo this year. The Ministry cabled the Chinese Embassy in Japan on March 28th to investigate. According to the reply, inquiries were made to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, and the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, and there were no plans to establish a Manchuria and Mongolia Pavilion in Tokyo. However, the Japan Industrial Association opened the Marine and Aviation Exposition in Ueno Park from March to May of this year. Inside the exhibition hall, there was an exhibit room of the South Manchuria Railway Company, displaying products from Dalian and Lushun, but there was no mention of "Manchuria and Mongolia." Furthermore, according to the embassy's cables on May 7th and 8th of the 19th year [of the Republic of China, i.e., 1930], the Matsuzakaya Department Store in Ueno, Tokyo, had a plan to establish a Manchuria and Mongolia Exposition. Contact was made with the business manager of the store, and he was persuaded to stop it. He said that the content of the exposition was purely commercial in nature and intended to attract trade, with absolutely no political implications, and he refused to stop it. However, he agreed to have the South Manchuria Railway Company take responsibility for it. A serious negotiation was held with the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Director of the Bureau stated that this kind of exhibition was only intended to introduce foreign affairs and had no political implications. He said that if China were to establish an exposition on Japanese affairs, Japan would certainly not object. After repeated arguments, he finally agreed to change it to an "Introduction to Manchuria and Mongolia Exposition" to be held on the sixth floor of the Matsuzakaya Department Store. It would display landscape photographs and product samples, and it would be a small-scale event with a duration of twenty days. Later, it was heard that Japan had listed Manchuria as a territory of Japan at the Antwerp Exposition. We cabled the Chinese embassy in Belgium to investigate, but no reply has been received.</p>
<p>The Case of Japanese Fishing Boats Trespassing into Chinese Territorial Waters to Fish: Starting from the 18th year [of the Republic of China, i.e., 1929], around one hundred Japanese fishing boats intruded into our fishing grounds from Longkou to Yangjiaogou. Other places, such as Ren Zhushan, Beidaihe, and Shidao and Shijiusuo in Shandong, also had Japanese ships intruding into the fishing nets. The losses amounted to over 30,000 yuan in one month. In June of that year, Japanese electric net boats trespassed into the area of Linqu County to fish, damaging the fishing gear of local fishermen, including over a dozen baskets of fishing hooks owned by Guan Yun and others, scattering the schools of fish and causing significant losses. From October to November, thirteen Japanese steamships fished in the waters off the Xinmin district. From the 18th to the 19th year [of the Republic of China, i.e., 1930], more than ten Japanese fishing vessels, such as the Hakata Maru, arbitrarily fished northeast of Huadao Mountain. In the spring of the 19th year [of the Republic of China, i.e., 1930], Japanese warships led over a thousand fishing boats, spreading them all over the waters outside Linhongkou and east of Mount Tai. On January 26th, a fishing boat operated by [omitted] was sunk by a Japanese ship in the Wenzhou area. The loss of the boat, fishing nets, and fishing gear was estimated at about 3,000 yuan. The loss of over 2,000 catties of fresh fish was estimated at about 600 yuan. From May to October, the Japanese ship "Hayabusa Maru" protected electric fishing boats and sailed near Furong Island in Laizhou Bay to fish. In September, Japanese fishing boats appeared in the Wusong, Yantai, and Baoshan areas. The submarine cables from Wusong to Yantai and from Baoshan to Yantai were repeatedly damaged by them. In October, the Japanese Penglai Fishing Company deployed fishing boats to fish deep into the coastal areas of Guangdong Province. In November, over twenty Japanese iron-hulled fishing boats intruded into the waters of Sheshan to fish. In January of the 20th year [of the Republic of China, i.e., 1931], nine Japanese electric boats loaded with guns sailed into Yulin Port and Yalong Port to fish. In February, over thirty Japanese fishing vessels, such as the Genmei Maru, Dalian Maru, and Man Sen Maru, fished in the waters of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Our side stated that Japanese fishing vessels were intruding into Chinese territorial waters and fishing freely, tearing sails and destroying nets of Chinese fishing boats at will, and that Japanese warships patrolled the waters, prohibiting Chinese fishermen from fishing, even violently ramming fishing boats. This constituted an infringement on Chinese sovereignty. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs protested to the Japanese side, requesting them to order Japanese fishing boats not to fly the Chinese flag, not to arbitrarily intrude and fish wantonly, and to immediately withdraw from Chinese territorial waters and ports to avoid disputes. The Japanese side replied that Japanese fishing boats were all fishing in international waters and had never fished in Chinese territorial waters, and that no Chinese fishing boats had been persecuted by Japanese warships. The Japanese said that the dispatch of warships to maintain order was due to the danger of pirates, to provide protection for Japanese fishing boats, and to crack down on any improper behavior of these boats; there was no other intention. They claimed that there was no factual basis for the claim that Japanese warships were interfering with Chinese fishing boats. They further stated that if China were to send patrol ships, they would be willing to cooperate with Japan to reach a satisfactory solution. The Ministry [omitted] consulted with the relevant ministries and departments and made overall plans. To prevent clandestine vessels and crack down on Japanese fishing vessels using Chinese ports as bases for fishing, it was submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval to instruct customs to prohibit all steamships and engine-powered vessels under 100 tons engaged in trade between Chinese ports and overseas ports from February 1st of the 20th year [of the Republic of China, i.e., 1931]. Furthermore, all fish imported from foreign ports, except for those imported by bona fide merchant ships with bills of lading, would be prohibited from May 1st of the 20th year [of the Republic of China, i.e., 1931]. Subsequently, the Japanese side applied to the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance to have Japanese fishing boats excluded from the ban. The Customs Administration believed that the shipowners would be affected if they were suddenly banned, and agreed to order the customs to postpone the enforcement of the ban for three months to allow them to make other plans. Around April, the Japanese Chargé d'Affaires issued a note expressing objections to the above ban, requesting that necessary measures be adopted to allow Japanese fishing boats to continue fishing in the waters close to China's international waters. Our side refuted this based on reason. At the same time, the Japanese side requested that the ban be extended. The Ministry of Finance also approved a cable on April 27th stating that the Customs Administration reported that there would be difficulties in implementing the ban. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs immediately consulted with the Ministry of Industry and agreed to instruct the Customs by cable during the negotiation period to temporarily suspend the implementation of the ban. On June 20th, officials from the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Industry, and Finance held a joint meeting and resolved that the issue of prohibiting Japanese fishing vessels from using Chinese seaports as bases would be handled by the diplomatic authorities who would negotiate with the Japanese Chargé d'Affaires, setting a deadline for withdrawal. If there were no results, the customs would enforce the ban.</p>
<p>The Case of Japanese Nationals Brutally Murdering Farmer Zhang Yutang in Gaiping County: After the owner of a morphine den, a Japanese national, was assassinated at the Gaiping Fenshui Railway Station, the Japanese police station dispatched officers to illegally arrest suspects within Chinese territory. The county magistrate repeatedly requested the Japanese police station to stop this practice. On May 23rd of the 18th year [of the Republic of China, i.e., 1929], three Japanese policemen arrested farmer Zhang Yutang in Bajiaoling, accusing him of being a suspect in the assassination of the morphine den owner. When they took him to the Japanese police station in Dashiqiao, the farmer, fearing for his life, tried to escape. The Japanese policemen fired their guns, injuring his thigh. The next day, the Japanese police station sent someone to ask the village chief to take him back for medical treatment, but to no avail. On the 25th, he died from his injuries. The village chief brought back his body and buried it. The Gaiping County Magistrate negotiated with the Japanese police station, demanding that the perpetrators be punished, that compensation be paid to the family of the victim, and that it be guaranteed that there would be no more arrests across borders in the future. At the same time, he reported the matter to the Yingkou Commissioner for Foreign Affairs for serious negotiation, but the case has not been resolved.</p>
<p>The Case of Japanese Police Breaking into the Liaoning Post Office and Stabbing a Postman: On June 15th of the 18th year [of the Republic of China, i.e., 1929], at 10:30 p.m., a Japanese policeman named Higure broke into the Liaoning Postal Administration Office in a rickshaw through the iron gate on the north side, passed through the office grounds, and went to the south gate. Finding the gate closed, he shouted loudly to have it opened. At this time, Li Wanlin, a mailman on duty in the gatehouse, and Zhen Zhankui, a postal assistant, heard the noise and came out. They politely tried to persuade him, saying that the gate was locked and that it would be best to go out through the north gate. The Japanese policeman was extremely unreasonable. As Li and Zhen escorted him to the entrance of the east building dormitory, the Japanese policeman suddenly drew his sword and slashed wildly, cutting Li's head and causing blood to flow profusely. Ignoring his injury, Li tried his best to hold on to the Japanese policeman. Seeing that his life was in danger, Zhen risked his life to step forward and snatch the Japanese policeman's weapon, running to a nearby branch office to report the incident. The branch office sent someone to take the Japanese policeman away. At the same time, the post office sent the injured mailman to the hospital for treatment. This case was submitted by the Liaoning Commissioner for Foreign Affairs to the local Japanese Consul General for negotiation, but no results have been obtained.</p>
<p>The Case of the Japanese Regiment Trampling and Destroying Farmland During Maneuvers in Changchun: The Japanese regiment stationed in Changchun often conducted field exercises, disregarding the farmers' production. In August of the 18th year [of the Republic of China, i.e., 1929], they trampled and destroyed nine mu of farmland owned by Li Sigong in Erdaogou. The former Changchun Commissioner for Foreign Affairs dispatched officials to investigate and estimate the losses together with the Japanese Consul and the military regiment, putting it at 120 Japanese yen. In other cases, the farmland of 16 households, including Lin Xiangchen in Huangguagou, was 6 xiang, the farmland of Hengyu, Zheng Ning, Rongxuan, and 4 other households was 12 xiang, and the sorghum field of Li Gongyi in Baizigou was 7 mu. The farmland of Gan Fengshu and 30 other households in Daping Village was over 150 xiang, with losses amounting to tens of thousands of yuan. Repeated letters were sent to the Japanese Consul, requesting him to investigate and demanding compensation for the losses. The Japanese Consul delayed in replying. In January of this year, the Japanese Consul sent a draft for 20 yuan, claiming that the damage to Li Sigong's farmland, which was 120 yuan, was excessive. He said that the Japanese military regiment had already directly negotiated with the victim, Li Sigong, and settled the matter with a draft for 20 yuan. He asked that it be passed on and claimed that Rong Ningxuan and others had not suffered any losses. The Commissioner refuted this by saying that the losses suffered by Li Sigong had been determined during the investigation and could not be settled with 20 Japanese yen. When he asked Li Sigong, he learned that the Japanese Consul's claim that he had negotiated with the Japanese regiment was completely false. The Japanese Consul, because the losses suffered by Li Sigong's household had already been jointly investigated and could not be denied, fabricated a story with 20 Japanese yen. The losses suffered by the other households, because the incident had occurred over a year ago and the traces had disappeared, were claimed to have not suffered any losses. The Commissioner immediately refuted this, but the Japanese Consul never replied.</p>
<p>The Case of Japanese Police Officer Injuring Mailman He Yousan in Liaoning: On August 23rd of the 18th year [of the Republic of China, i.e., 1929], when He Yousan, a mailman at the Liaoning Post Office, was delivering mail in the South Manchuria Railway-affiliated area, a Japanese policeman suddenly forcibly took him to the [omitted] Japanese police station, searched his mailbag, threw the letters on the ground, confiscated one copy of the [omitted] newspaper, and kicked and beat the mailman He Yousan. The Postmaster, Yan Ming, confirmed that there were injuries to his fingers and shins. He immediately separately met with the Japanese Consul, Nichide, and the Japanese Police Chief, Kanmu, and negotiated verbally, demanding that the offending policeman be punished. The Consul and the Police Chief both expressed regret and promised to investigate, but subsequently, the Japanese Consul General replied that the report received by the police station did not match the mailman's account and refused to comply. The Liaoning Postal Administration then transferred the entire case to the Liaoning Commissioner for Foreign Affairs for further handling. As of now, the Commissioner for Foreign Affairs has not reported any resolution to the case. (To be continued)</p>

It has had a surplus every year. This year, due to the impact of the flood in northern Jiangsu, it was difficult to recover loans, but deposits and interbank transactions had to be paid in full. With skillful management, it was still able to maintain operations. Recently, it was slightly affected by the constraint of a certain shareholder. Its cash flow suddenly became tight. Another shareholder tried to provide relief in the hopes of turning the crisis into an opportunity. However, Zhou Jiasan, the manager, believed that although the accounts receivable and payable could be offset, it was difficult to recover the loans and it was impossible to maintain operations. Therefore, he automatically announced the suspension of business. However, because the shareholders were not informed in advance and there were no corresponding measures taken afterward, it caused a lot of disputes. Depositors and various banks now intend to first clear the shop's accounts. If it can be maintained, they will discuss business operations with the shop's shareholders.</p>

<p>Two Bandits Shot After Kidnapping: In May of this year, there was a case of kidnapping the young son of Zhu Zhengke in Youfangqiao for a large ransom.

<h3>Anqing</h3>
<p>Anhui University Students Voluntarily Go to Beijing to Petition</p>
<p>Li Dachang and other students from Anhui University, a provincial university in Anqing, initiated a petition to the capital due to students from various regions going to Beijing to petition. Their patriotic zeal did not want to lag behind others. They initiated the petition to Beijing some days ago, and more than two hundred people signed up willing to go. Thus, on the evening of the 10th, it was decided that they would voluntarily go to Beijing to petition and requested Principal He Lu of the university to return their library deposit as travel expenses. He Lu then submitted this to the tenth administrative meeting of the university, which decided to first dissuade them. If that proved ineffective, the principal should convene a meeting to instruct the petitioning students to strictly maintain order and not betray the essence of patriotism. For the students remaining at the school, from that day until the 17th, in addition to intensifying military training, the regular courses would be temporarily changed to special lectures for two hours each day. Currently, the dissuasion of the students has been ineffective, and they originally planned to depart last night (the 11th). However, due to the lack of a steamer to Anhui, they were unable to proceed. It was decided that they would set off tonight (the 12th). The university has temporarily suspended classes since the afternoon of the 11th.</p>

<h3>Letter from Gao Dezhong, Hangzhou</h3>
<p>I recently read in your newspaper (in the Hangzhou News section) an item about the former Director of Xiaoshan Finance Bureau being detained and transferred due to embezzlement. This does not accord with the facts. Upon investigation, during the handover of duties, the incumbent county magistrate has not yet submitted the review books. The date for the joint accounting has been set. On the morning of the 9th, I received an instruction from Director Wang, limiting one month to complete the joint accounting. There was no detention or transfer involved. I am writing to inform you accordingly, and I hope you will make a correction. Gao Dezhong, December 11th.</p>

<p>Socialization of Universities by Gao Jiansi</p>
<p>The issue of schools becoming "centers of society" arose in the United States about twenty years ago. People have both spiritual and material needs. How to satisfy and guide these needs is the sole responsibility of the university. Lecturing, studying, learning, investigating, researching, experimenting, etc., are all methods. Satisfying and guiding the needs of life is the purpose. Methods and purpose are closely related—not only should they not be separate, but they should also be suitable. Methods must be able to achieve the purpose to be considered suitable. For example, good health is the goal, and studying hygiene is the method. If the hygiene being studied does not contribute to good health or even harms it, the irrelevance or unsuitability of the method and purpose is self-evident.</p>
<p>Universities are responsible for satisfying the proper needs of life and guiding improper needs back to the proper path. How can universities fulfill this responsibility? They must be socialized as "centers of society." What is socialization? A university that takes the safety and progress of society as its responsibility is a socialized university. The ancients said, "Everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the nation," meaning that individuals must be socialized. What we are now clearly advocating is: "The university is responsible for the safety (and progress or lack thereof) of society."</p>
<p>Is not the university the highest institution of learning? Is it not where various experts and social leaders come from? Is it not where the public's expectations lie? University, university, can you not take the safety of society as your responsibility?</p>
<p>Therefore, the instability of world peace, the economic panic, the increasing number of unemployed, the diversion of thought, and China's continuous internal strife, bandits everywhere, backward production, floods, the grabbing of profits and power, the lack of clarity in politics, the decline in customs, and all other kinds of evils—none of these are not due to universities failing to fulfill their duties. From another perspective, the university itself must take responsibility and say, "Do we want lasting world peace? Do we want to reduce unemployment? Do we want China's production to develop? Do we want someone to control the floods? Do we want clear politics?… We must rely on universities, and we must hope for the emergence of university talents." If the university takes on such a responsibility without shirking it, shouldn't studying be socialized?</p>
<p>The socialization of universities can be divided into small and large scales. If a university strives to be the center of a village or town, it can be called a university of that village or town. If it strives to be the center of a country or the world, it can be called a university of that country or the world.</p>
<p>The ancients said, "Everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the nation." This is to socialize the individual. Today, we say, "The university is responsible for the safety of society." This is to socialize the university. Strive, strive, university socialization!</p>

<h3>Fujian Education Department Initiates National Salvation Savings</h3>
<p>(Fuzhou Correspondence) Cheng Shih-Kuei, the director of Fujian Education Department, convened representatives of the academic community to discuss methods for initiating national salvation savings. On the afternoon of the 4th, he convened more than one hundred people, including department heads, faculty members, student representatives, and personnel from social education institutions, for a meeting in the main auditorium. The meeting was chaired by Cheng, who announced three points of significance: (1) National salvation should be based on practical preparation. (2) National salvation savings is a duty that citizens should fulfill. (3) The academic community initiates national salvation savings to promote it in society. Next, they discussed: 1. The principle proposal for national salvation savings, which was approved unanimously. 2. The methods for national salvation savings, which were approved with amendments. The following is an excerpt from the methods for collecting national salvation savings in the academic community of Fujian Province: (1) This savings fund is donated by personnel from educational administrative agencies, faculty and staff of schools, students, and staff of social education institutions in this province. (2) The funds are collected by the donating agencies and submitted to the Central Bank of China or the Bank of China in this province for storage as reserve funds, and a report is made to the Fujian Education Department. (3) Those among the personnel of educational administrative agencies, faculty and staff of schools, and staff and students of social education institutions who donate more than the following standards will be awarded medals by the Fujian Education Department to encourage them. A. For faculty and staff of educational agencies and schools with a salary of less than 100 yuan, a donation exceeding 10 yuan; for those with a salary of more than 100 yuan, a donation exceeding 20 yuan; for those with a salary of more than 200 yuan or 300 yuan, a donation exceeding 30 yuan. B. For students, a donation exceeding 5 yuan. (4) The Fujian Education Department prints three-part receipts, which are given to the bank. When the savings are received, the bank fills them out, delivers the corresponding parts to the depositing agency, and sends one part to the Education Department, with the remaining part kept in the bank for future reference. (5) The deadline for depositing this savings fund into the bank is the end of February of the 20th year of the Republic of China at the latest. (6) Three to five supervisors are stationed at the location where the savings fund is deposited. When withdrawing the savings, the approval of the Fujian Education Department is required, and all supervisors in that location must sign and stamp the document before it can be withdrawn. If the supervisors have not been selected and there is an urgent need for national salvation, the Education Department is responsible for stamping the document and transferring the funds for use. (7) This savings fund is reserved for national salvation needs. If a foreign war occurs, the funds will be remitted immediately. If there is no need to spend them, they should be retained as an educational fund for the province, and the methods will be determined separately. (8) The names of the donors and the amount of savings in each educational institution will be published by the Fujian Education Department in the Education Weekly from time to time, and the total amount of savings and annual interest will be listed and announced by the Education Department.</p>
<h3>Nanjing Middle School Students Petition to Return to School</h3>
<p>Satisfied with the Reply from the Jiangsu Education Department</p>
<p>Faculty and Staff Refuse to Resume Classes Due to Unresolved School Affairs Issues</p>
<p>Students from the preparatory Jiangsu Provincial Nanjing Middle School, due to the issue of teacher resignations, sent about seventy or eighty representatives to Zhenjiang yesterday to petition. At about four o'clock, they went directly to the Education Department from the train station. Director Chen first sent Section Chief Nie to inquire about the students' intentions, which were stated in four points: (1) Please approve Principal Zhang's resignation. (2) Order faculty and staff to resume classes. (3) Please do not start the vacation early. (4) Please appoint a capable principal. Later, Director Chen himself went to the main auditorium to meet with the students and explained each point of the students' petition: (1) Principal Zhang has worked hard to maintain school affairs for two years. This time, he was persuaded to stay in his position. (2) The faculty and staff stated to the department that the students were not attending classes, so there were no classes for the faculty and staff to teach. If the students are willing to attend classes, the department can urge the faculty and staff to resume teaching as usual. (3) There is no such thing as starting the vacation early. (4) This is related to the first point and does not need to be answered. He also repeatedly advised the students that the patriotic movement should not abandon their studies. This lasted for three or four hours. The students expressed dissatisfaction with the point of retaining the principal and insisted on approving his resignation. Director Chen explained repeatedly, but to no avail. The students said that no matter what, there must be a complete solution. Otherwise, not only will the students coming to the province not be able to return to Beijing, but more than a thousand students in Beijing have also decided to come to the province tomorrow. Director Chen had no choice but to withdraw. Later, Secretary-General Jin of the Provincial Government, upon hearing the news, went to the department and repeatedly persuaded and explained to the students. The students insisted that they were entrusted by the assembly and would not leave the province until the Provincial Government approved Zhang's resignation. Until about one o'clock in the middle of the night, the students still held on in the biting cold. Secretary-General Jin then used a long-distance phone call to ask Chairman, who was in the two capitals, to allow the issue to be submitted to the Provincial Government for resolution. The students then expressed satisfaction. However, as it was already late at night and there was no place to stay, the Education Department could not even arrange for blankets. They huddled around the stove in the main auditorium and talked until dawn, and then took the Beijing-Shanghai train back to Beijing.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 14th Telegraph. The seventy student representatives from Nanjing Middle School who went to Zhenjiang to petition have returned to Beijing and spoke with the faculty and staff representatives, hoping that classes would resume immediately. The faculty and staff said that they would not resume teaching until the principal's issue was resolved.</p>
<h3>President Yang of Qingdao University Resigns</h3>
<p>Qingdao University President Yang Zhensheng's resignation telegram reads: "Respectfully to Minister Li of the Ministry of Education, Nanjing. One hundred and seventy-nine students of this school have signed up to go to Beijing to petition for anti-Japanese affairs. Despite repeated persuasion, all efforts have been ineffective. When they were about to leave, they jointly asked for leave, but without approval, they left the school on the second of this month. This has been telegraphed. This action, according to the Ministry's orders and school regulations, is unpermitted. However, their actions are driven by patriotic zeal. If punished, the youth's patriotic spirit may be frustrated. If not punished, the school's discipline will not be strict, and there will be no way to maintain it. Zhensheng, holding the position of president of this school, has no other way to handle it than to respectfully request approval to resign, in order to emphasize responsibility and maintain discipline. This is the best course of action."</p>

<h3>Aurora University Experiences Turmoil</h3>
<p>Announces Vacation...Students Leave School</p>
<p>Aurora University students decided on the 12th at the University Anti-Japanese Joint Conference that one-third of the students from each school should participate in the demonstration in Beijing. The school's representatives returned to the school that evening. At eight o'clock the next morning, they announced the resolution to all students and convened an emergency representative meeting. It was unanimously decided to comply with the resolution of the joint conference and immediately requested the school's permission. However, the request was rejected three times. At that time, a list of more than one hundred students who voluntarily signed up to demonstrate in Beijing was received. The representative meeting ordered the more than one hundred students who volunteered to participate to prepare everything and decided to hold a plenary meeting during the morning exercise the next day (yesterday morning) and then automatically depart as a whole. The representative meeting itself went to the office to prepare everything.</p>
<p>While the entire representative body of the Anti-Japanese Association was engaged in various matters related to going to Beijing in the office, the dean of academic affairs suddenly led armed police into the room, forcibly removed the representatives from the office, and confiscated all seals and documents. Subsequently, the representatives held a meeting outside the school to respond and decided not to make any announcements that night and to go to the North Station for a demonstration during the military exercise the next day. However, this news was known to students who had a history with the school, who reported it to the authorities. The school immediately announced the start of the New Year vacation that evening and patrolled the school with plainclothes detectives, causing key members of the representative body to not dare stay in the school overnight. Late into the night, the authorities were still using electric torches to patrol each dormitory.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the school ordered everyone except Catholics to leave the school today, and plainclothes detectives patrolled the school, allowing only exits and no entries. Because the key representatives did not dare to return to the school, the students did not know what to do. They could only pack their luggage and leave the school gate. Most of the students had not yet received remittances, and they were being urged to pay for food and miscellaneous expenses they owed, and they were being blocked by creditors at the school gate, leaving them unable to move forward or backward. Afterwards, it was reported that the Anti-Japanese Representative Association of the school decided to register the students, urge them to leave the school permanently, and send all representatives to the Ministry of Education to petition for the return of Aurora's educational rights and to request the establishment of another school to accommodate all the students who left the school.</p>

<p>Since the anti-Japanese meeting of Ai Qun Girls' High School on Penglai Road decided to suspend classes last week, it established a strike committee to oversee all work during the strike. The school believes that anti-Japanese and national salvation work should not only not be suspended due to the strike, but should be intensified. Therefore, the strike committee formulated practical measures, such as rescue, practice, military, exercise, etc., and emphasized the importance of going out to publicize.</p>

<h3>Jiang University Soccer Jinan Wins the Final Right</h3>
<p>5 to 1, Yesterday Defeated Fudan</p>
<p>Will Compete in the Final Against Jiaotong University</p>
<p>In the soccer championship of the Jiang University Sports Association, Jinan and Fudan faced off yesterday in Jiangwan. Both teams are strong, so this battle was extremely important. Within ten minutes of the start, Jinan scored two goals. Later, Fudan also scored one goal. In the first half, Jinan took the lead with a score of three to one. In the second half, Jinan scored two more goals. As a result, the score was five to one, and Jinan won. The spectators were quite enthusiastic, mostly Fudan students. There were also many Shanghai soccer fans who went to watch. The details are recorded below.</p>

<p>Fudan Only Blames Itself</p>
<p>Referee Chen Jixiang blew the whistle, and Fudan kicked off. Jinan immediately invaded Fudan's goal. Less than five minutes into the battle, Fudan's Wang Shusen accidentally headed the ball into his own goal while trying to save it. Jinan was overjoyed, while Fudan was frustrated. After Jinan scored this goal, their spirit was even more invigorated. About five minutes later, Fudan was penalized with a penalty kick. Chen Zhenhe kicked the ball, and within ten minutes, Jinan scored two goals in a row. Fudan only had themselves to blame.</p>
<p>Jinan's Goal Was Breached</p>
<p>Fudan was very unfortunate to lose these two goals, and they rallied their spirits, aiming to expand their grand plan. Jinan's Qiu Dongyan intended to save the ball, but it hit Feng Han You's back. Goalkeeper Jiang Zongjin tried to save it but was unable to. Fudan's Gong Yixun saw the opportunity and rushed up to shoot the ball into the goal. Fudan scored a goal in return, and the morale was boosted. They fought again, but Jinan was unwilling to show weakness and resisted. Fudan ultimately could do nothing. Chen Baomiao once advanced but returned without success. Yun Shijian Mei Hongbao dribbled the ball and passed it to the center. Chen Zhenxiang intercepted it and, in the midst of the melee, Chen attacked and scored into the Fudan goal. The first half ended with a score of three to one, with Jinan taking the lead.</p>
<p>Little Mei Played Well</p>
<p>The sound of the restart was heard, and Jinan's soldiers invaded the enemy camp. Mei Hongbao changed his feet nimbly and made a great contribution. The ball hit the crossbar and bounced into the net, impossible to save. It was only three minutes after the start of the second half. At this time, Fudan's goalkeeper, Qu Hongde, arrived late and immediately entered the arena in uniform to guard the goal. Fudan's courage was greatly boosted, and the forwards pressed Jinan. Sun Huipei had a chance, but unfortunately, he was too hasty and went out of bounds, which was a pity. Jinan's army once again surrounded Fudan, and Qu Hongde became the target of everyone and was exhausted from dealing with it. Fortunately, Guan Xun An guarded the line well, and there was no loss.</p>
<p>The Result Was Five to One</p>
<p>In the midst of the melee, Chen Zhenhe and Li Lin had a small conflict, but they did not resort to violence. The referee and players from both sides mediated to stop it. Fudan counterattacked again but made no achievements. Instead, Jinan's Chen Zhenhe dribbled the ball deep into Fudan's goal, about a dozen yards from the goal, and shot from a distance. The ball rolled towards the goal, very fast. Fudan's goalkeeper Qu used his feet instead of his hands, and the ball rolled into the net under his legs. Qu made a big mistake, leading to a major mistake. As a result, Jinan won with a score of five to one.</p>
<p>Again in the Final Against Jiaotong University</p>
<p>Jinan won easily yesterday, controlling the whole game. Fudan's talents were average, but because they had to go to Beijing to petition today, they were too hasty in the battle and very timid. Their experience was also relatively poor and not as bold as Jinan's. The wings were very weak, and the three center forwards were very good. Li Lin had a special performance. Jinan has faced Jiaotong University in the final for many years, and today is the same. It's a real feud.</p>

<h3>The Voice of Resistance Against Japan</h3>
<p>— Liang</p>
<p>Cheng De Gao, father of Cheng Feng Shan, a correspondent dispatched by this newspaper from Changhuaiwei, Bengbu, whose courtesy name is Yangzhi, is sixty-six years old this year, and has always enjoyed books and history. Because he read in the Shen Bao about Chairman Ma's heroic resistance against Japan in Heihe, he lectured the people daily, often weeping bitterly. Later, upon hearing that Ma's army had retreated to Keshan, he slammed the table and shouted loudly, his face suddenly turning pale. He then recited a poem of farewell: "Who will support the collapsing mansion? The vast land of China is like a sleeping lion. Tell my children to listen to my last words: remove the strong and repay your old father." After reciting, he sighed deeply, and his breath ceased. This old man's love for his country and his martyrdom must be recorded.</p>
<p>Bu Ting Qi Talks About Removing Weeds</p>
<h3>The Children's Chicken (Part Two)</h3>
<p>A Letter to Xu Jun Qizhou</p>
<p>I suspect you may have already thought about the later stages of development, but perhaps due to environmental obstacles, you have been forced to stop at the second stage. For this, we of course have considerable understanding. Mr. Fan Jingsheng once told me that in the past, at the Capital University, because a Japanese instructor dissected a sheep in the classroom for the students, it aroused the Empress Dowager's great anger, and the Minister of Education Zhang Baixi was so anxious that he entered the court to kowtow and request punishment. This is similar to your chicken hatching. However, in civilized Shanghai, something like "School is an important place, chickens are not allowed" will probably not happen, right? Therefore, I urge you to muster your courage and do it.</p>
<p>The first stage of education will not even bloom a flower, let alone bear fruit! The second stage of education will only bloom flowers, but not bear fruit. It is not until the third stage that it will bear fruit, but the fruit may not be delicious and large. To have delicious and large fruit, one must jump to the fourth stage. The fourth stage is the ultimate in the integration of teaching, learning, and doing: it has already become one with science here.</p>
<p>Let's take the children's chicken as an example. Hatching chickens is an essential activity. If you raise two groups of chickens: one group with a rooster, and one group without a rooster, and mark the eggs laid by the two groups of chickens, hatch them, and see which group's eggs hatch into chicks, that would be even better. Furthermore, dissect the eggs that have been incubated for three days, five days, seven days, nine days..., to see what changes have taken place in each egg, and create a set of specimens from the development of the egg to the chick, wouldn't that be even more interesting? Furthermore, comparing the egg-laying ability and inheritance of various chickens can gradually be promoted in elementary schools. Of course, elementary schools have other subjects, not chicken hatching research institutes, so how much can you do? But hatching a few chickens and making a few sets of specimens can't be considered wishful thinking. You are an experienced elementary school teacher, do you think what I have described is correct? I hope you will not hesitate to give me your advice. I wish you success in leading the children to attack nature. ...</p>
<h3>The Unknown Hero in the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>In the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, although our country did not win, there were indeed some heroes who loyally gave their lives, enough to glorify the annals of history, such as Deng Shichang and Zuo Baogui. I once heard my friend Mingdao Gu Zi talk about an anecdote of an unknown hero, Zhu Tieqiang (Iron Spear), in that war. My friend is a talented writer, and perhaps he has already recorded it in his books, but I have not had the opportunity to see it. Now, I will describe what I have heard below, as a model for comrades resisting Japan. Zhu Tieqiang lost his name. From childhood, he was extremely brave and unparalleled, good at using a spear. When he danced, he moved up, down, left, and right, spinning like flying. The faster he danced, the faster it became, only seeing a ball of white light, not seeing the person. If a giant urn of water was poured on him, there would be no drop on his collar, because the light and air tightly surrounded him, with no gaps to enter. Therefore, he had the nickname Zhu Tieqiang. When the Sino-Japanese War started, Tieqiang rose up and joined the command of Zuo Baogui, winning many victories. Baogui quickly rewarded his strength and promoted him. In the Battle of Pyongyang, Tieqiang and Zuo each led an army to fight the Japanese pirates. The Japanese had long heard of Zhu's courage and were angry at the number of people he had killed, so they launched a large-scale attack to take revenge. Tieqiang rode his horse and galloped, killing hundreds and thousands of Japanese again. But the enemy was numerous and he was outnumbered. The Japanese soldiers surged like a tide. Zhu's army suffered countless casualties, and the corpses piled up into a Jingguan (mound of corpses). Tieqiang still did not retreat slightly. Some advised him, but Tieqiang's eyes were wide open and his canthus were about to split, and said, "A true man should die in battle, wrapped in horsehide. I have no regrets." Then Tieqiang rushed out of the formation to rescue Zuo who was surrounded. At that time, only three or four hundred cavalry followed Tieqiang. Tieqiang led them to fight one against a hundred, rescuing Zuo from the central army. The Japanese's left and right wings attacked, and giant cannons fired shells, like the rumbling of thunder. The smoke and gunpowder obscured vision. Tieqiang was not afraid at all. After fierce fighting, he was finally killed by the Japanese emperor's third nephew. The Japanese hated Tieqiang even more. The soldiers surrounded him tightly. During the struggle between Tieqiang and Zuo, a merciless bullet hit Tieqiang's elbow, breaking it and causing blood to flow profusely, changing the color of the sandy desert. He and Zuo died together. Even in his dying moments, he shouted loudly to kill the Japanese, not stopping. Those who heard it were moved. The Japanese and our China have a long-standing feud. This time, they have trampled on the Northeast, treating our people like meat on a chopping board. If we do not rise up to resist them, the country will not exist, and where will the people be attached? Zhu Tieqiang, if your soul is conscious, you must be weeping in the nine springs.</p>
<h3>A New Invention to Avoid Airplane Deaths Using Wireless Radio</h3>
<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>The airplane, although it is the only important means of transportation in modern times, since its invention, the number of people who have sacrificed their lives due to aviation is countless. Recently, such as the Chinese poet Xu Zhimo, also died in an aviation accident. Therefore, European and Western countries pay close attention to the issue of aircraft accidents, hoping to reduce the danger to the lives of aviators. London is developing a method to reduce aircraft accidents by using wireless radio to transmit messages. After this method is implemented, it can save the lives of many aviators. What is this method? It is to predict drastic weather changes and use wireless radio to transmit messages. Even a thousand miles away, if a hurricane suddenly rises, the weather instrument can detect waves and report the news. The inventor of this method is an Englishman named Wass. This device can be placed in a small house. A thousand miles away, even a small electric light is emitted. This weather instrument can use wireless radio to jump into the darkness and then use eyesight to observe. The discovery of hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean, Central Asia, and Asia can be seen at a glance. The strength of the wind and the height of the air temperature are all recorded. This device has a special and amazing feature, that is, it can express 3,000 kinds of symbols in one second. Therefore, weather observers can always point out where the storm originates. There are two observatories in northern England and Scotland, which cooperate with each other to make the start and stop and location of gales and rainstorms clearer. Then, the results are reported to the aviators, so that they can prepare early and not collide with the storm, so that the number of accidents can also be reduced.</p>

<p>Restrictions on British University Students</p>
<p>Students at Oxford University in England are subject to very strict restrictions. Even when renting a car, they are not allowed to exceed one hour each time. If it is necessary to exceed this time, they must obtain the permission of the president.</p>
<p>Child Marriage in New York Child marriage in New York is gradually increasing, shocking the local authorities. According to a survey, there were 552 elementary school students who got married in the past year. Among them, one groom was only fourteen years old, and the bride was only twelve years old.</p>

<h3>Casual Talks From Di Xiang Zhai</h3>
<p>— Gan Dang</p>
<p>Cen Chi (Continued)</p>
<p>Chi respectfully replied, "Your daughter was born in a noble family, while I am a poor scholar. It is not a match." His late uncle said, "A gentleman is steadfast in poverty, a principle you have always adhered to. With such talent and learning, your future fame and position will surpass mine. Why do you use poverty as an excuse?" Sincere words were spoken from the heart. After careful consideration, they finally agreed to the marriage. He was appointed as Second Magistrate by donating grain, and entered the staff of Tao Mo, the Governor-General of Shaanxi and Gansu, and was appointed as the magistrate of Chang'an County through Mo's recommendation. He met Cen Chunxuan, the Provincial Treasurer, through Mo's introduction. Chunxuan's ancestors were originally from Zhejiang. In terms of seniority, he was a cousin. Over time, the two became closer. Chi was honest, upright, and had exceptional insight and judgment. After Chunxuan was promoted to Governor of Shaanxi, Mo planned to retire and return to his hometown, so he welcomed Chi to live in the governor's residence as his teacher, consulting him on everything before acting. From then on, from Jin to Shu to Liang Yue, Chi never left his side. According to the custom, at the end of the year, the staff of the governor's office could request a formal appointment for their officials, which is called "Ba'an" (recommendation). Chunxuan always placed Chi's name at the beginning of the memorial, but Chi often crossed it out with his pen, displeased, and said, "This is not what I want. It cannot be forced." Chunxuan thought he was being modest and asked him. Chi said, "I look at myself in the mirror and see that wealth and fame are not for me." Chunxuan laughed and said, "You were once a Second Magistrate, weren't you an official?" Chi said, "That is enough." Xuan knew that his will could not be changed and never mentioned it again. Chi supported Xuan's measures that were appropriate and reasonable, and did not hesitate to praise them. Conversely, he would argue face to face without any leniency. Xuan usually did not give in to anyone's words, regardless of whether they were appropriate or not, but he regarded Chi as a good teacher and friend, listening to his words and following his advice. The memorials impeaching Yikuang and others were all written by Chi. When the Xinhai Revolution broke out, Xuan was reappointed as the Governor of Sichuan and telegraphed to summon Chi. Chi did not go. He insisted on requesting it. Then he crossed the ferry to Hanfu and told Xuan, "The world is about to be in great chaos. This is just a slight glimpse of it. You decide for yourself whether to advance, retreat, go out, or stay. I am old and cannot accompany you." Then he returned home. After returning, he disguised himself as a Taoist priest, wandering in the mountains and springs, singing poems for pleasure. One year, he leaned on his cane to climb Mount Tai and visited the sage Confucius in Qufu, sighing and lamenting, "The Great Dao has not been practiced for a long time. The great chaos in the world is not far away. I cannot bear to witness it." He died at the age of seventy-odd. His son, Jiao Lin, was able to inherit his family learning, and was pure and resembled his father. In the late Qing Dynasty, he knew Anwei Wuwei Prefecture. In the Republic of China, he served as a tax official and magistrate of Wujin, taking not a single hair's breadth dishonestly. After a man of virtue, there must be talented people. I am even more convinced of this.</p>
<h3>A Spirited Anti-Japanese Banquet</h3>
<p>— Yanzi</p>
<p>Since the brutal Japanese invasion and occupation of Liaoning and Jilin, patriotic people in our country have been running around, calling for unity against Japan. Mr. Sun Xueni, the owner of Sheng Sheng Fine Arts Company, has always been enthusiastic about saving the country, fearing that foreigners will accuse him of having a five-minute fever. He specially produced a set of five-color anti-Japanese calendars, painted by his talented student Tian Qingquan and inscribed by his friends He Tianjian, Yu Yifen, and others. They are shocking and can serve as a wake-up call for the people of our country, hoping that every household will have one and keep it in mind forever. The intention is good and appreciated by all. Yesterday was the date of the company's banquet for guests, and I was also among those invited. The banquet was held at Liuheju on Guangxi Road. On the windows facing the road, the words "Sheng Sheng Company Anti-Japanese Banquet on the Second Floor" were written in large red paint. Inside the building, the walls were covered with more than ninety kinds of various five-color embossed calendar baseboards produced by the company, and thirty-one anti-Japanese calendars. Before long, well-known figures from the political, business, and academic circles in Shanghai gathered one after another. Xueni and his younger brother Guangdi greeted them and showed them to their seats, distributing anti-Japanese calendars and a set of embossed calendars and anti-Japanese postcards produced by the company. First, Mr. Sun reported the purpose of printing this anti-Japanese calendar for anti-Japanese propaganda, and advertisements welcoming domestic goods were not charged. Thousands of words were eloquent and appropriate. His painstaking efforts moved those who heard it. Then, guests Chen Xuyuan, Lu Fengzhu, Qian Shoutie, Wu Zihao, Zhang Zilian, He Tianjian, and others stood up and gave speeches. They were passionate and aroused listeners. Mr. Qian shouted loudly, speaking from the bottom of his heart, extremely painful. Xuyuan's speech was subtle and satirical, using the words "mother-in-law and daughter-in-law" to express the weaknesses of the Chinese people. Only Sheng Sheng Company has the heart of continuous life and death, and fights the enemy. It is truly admirable. If the people of the country could have one set in every home and hang it on the right side of their seats, they could never forget it year after year, day after day, and moment after moment. The attitude was calm during the speech, with the wonder of chatting and joking. The applause from the audience rang out. Commentators said that this old man was romantic and unrestrained, and was indeed extraordinary. He's speech was appropriate in its metaphors, and exposed the worldly customs without leaving anything out, and was better able to awaken the Chinese people's dreams. After the earnest speeches of these famous people, the number of people who placed orders that evening came one after another. It can be seen that the patriotic heart of the people of the country is ten thousand times higher than that of the public officials. By the time the banquet was over, the clock had struck ten.</p>

<h3>Sharing The Enemy (12)</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 3 Escaping the Tiger's Mouth</p>
<p>When that bullet flew over, fortunately, Hua Naiqiang had quick eyes and immediately squatted down. The bullet swept over his head and missed. Hua Naiqiang took advantage of this opportunity to fire back and knocked the Japanese soldier to the ground. He somersaulted and jumped off the wall. Zhongshu was squatting on the ground. First, she heard the gunshot, then saw Hua Naiqiang jump down, knowing that he had escaped danger. She quickly stood up. Hua Naiqiang said, "That was close. A Japanese soldier chased after me, but fortunately, I killed him. Let's go quickly." So the two fled to a secluded place. At this time, the area was full of Japanese soldiers. The inspection was very strict. The two hid the pistols and Mauser pistols under their clothes to avoid being seen by the thieves and causing obstacles. They thought that they could not go to the city. They should go to T City. But on their way, they had to cross the railway. And that side was stationed by the Japanese army. If they were questioned, it would be difficult to escape. So the two discussed that it was an emergency situation. Fleeing in the daytime was very inconvenient and dangerous. It was better to wait until the evening to leave. For now, they should find a hiding place and avoid it for a while. The two ran a mile or two in the field and saw a low house. An old woman and a seven or eight-year-old boy were looking around in front of the door. The two ran to the front of the house. The old woman first greeted them and asked Hua Naiqiang, "Sir, did you come from the city?" Hua Naiqiang nodded in reply, "Exactly." The old woman said, "The sound of guns and cannons last night almost scared our souls away. This morning, I heard that the Japanese country came to attack our city. We don't know what's going on. My son, Changfu, works as a servant in the city. I don't know how his life is. We are very anxious." Saying this, she pointed to the child with her finger and said, "He is my grandson. He is urging me to take him to see his father." Sir, do you think we have the courage to enter the city?" Hua Naiqiang said, "That's right. Don't go to the city. We also fled from there. The Japanese army is extremely brutal." After Hua Naiqiang finished speaking, the child cried for his father. Zhongshu stepped forward to stop his crying. Hua Naiqiang said to the old woman, "We want to borrow your house to hide for a while. We will flee again at night. Please go in quickly now. Lest they see us and cause trouble." So the old woman led the two inside. The house was very dark and cramped. The two did not care about it and sat down to rest, silently. Although they were not talking at the door, their hearts were full of thoughts and anger, and they were very sad. The old woman brought two cups of tea to respect the guests. Zhongshu said, "Please don't bother. We only need to bother you for two meals. We will thank you heavily when we leave." The old woman said, "Don't rush. Guests, please sit down."</p>

<h3>Financial Gold Standard Declines Weakly</h3>
<p>Down Fifteen Taels and a Half</p>
<p>News is Conflicting, Market Extremely Chaotic. Yesterday, the 14th, the gold standard fluctuated dramatically, the decline was quite severe, the market was chaotic, the waves were extremely large, and the momentum was unstoppable. There was a difference of 22 taels throughout the day, and finally, there was a hidden drop of more than fifteen taels. Fellow traders were mentally disturbed and numb, and deposits and withdrawals were very different. The initial opening was a drop, which was really due to the establishment of the new Japanese cabinet, which was about to abandon the gold standard, and the heavy ban on cash exports, as well as the slow payment of war debts, etc., which were enough to affect it. When it broke through 640 taels, then, due to the vigorous purchases by large households from all sides, and it was heard that the League of Nations could resolve the Sino-Japanese issue peacefully, people's hearts turned better, and there was a sudden and rapid increase, which had already broken through the 60 taels mark. However, the trend of foreign exchange was loose and excessive, especially because large households turned around and sold again, so the price could not be sustained, and it was less than 10 taels again. The after-market slightly hovered, but the swap was imminent, and the multilateral intended to knock on a large discount to hold it up. Finally, it was outside of 50 taels, but at this time, the situation was precarious and unstable, so the rise and fall situation was particularly difficult to predict.</p>
<p>Opening Plummets Twenty-Seven and a Half Taels. Since the early opening, there has been a sharp drop of 27 taels and 5 mace, to 642 taels (before the market opened, it was around 40 taels). Both the large bars and the silver price fell by three-eighths from the day before yesterday, but Japan's ban on gold is about to be implemented, so the opening was low. The Dalian gang and others sold a lot, and it continued to drop to 39 and a half taels. Suddenly, it stepped into the clouds, and the numbers moved forward together, such as Taichang Zhifeng Yongcheng Fengyong Yifeng Yongqian Changxiang Yongfeng, etc. all purchased. Especially because the US dollar decreased from 34.0625 yuan to 33.625 yuan, the bank's appetite was still good, and it had already risen sharply by 22 taels, reaching 61 and a half taels. However, there were two or three taels of ups and downs in half an hour. When British gold opened at 25 large, and the US dollar was long at 875, the exchange rate increased greatly, and it had already dropped to 54 taels and 5 mace. Afterwards, it turned around and increased again, and the hedgers came in to calculate 8 and a half taels, but the Dalian gang actually came out, retreating to 2 and a half taels, and the US dollar was still firm. The bank traded 33.5625 yuan, and absorbed 625 again. Also, British gold was 11 pence 6875. Banks had mutual transactions, so it was 59 and a half taels at 10:20. In a moment, Qian Changxiang Zhifeng Yongliang and others sold out, and Mitsui and others bought 8125 for British gold, and in just over ten minutes, it retreated to 53 taels. Before long, it added more than 3 taels. But the buyers were too persistent, such as Qian Changxiang Zhifeng Yongyuan Mao Yongda Decheng Hongkang Yong, etc. all sold out. As the draft also began to loosen and weaken, the price could not be sustained, and it was reduced by 8 taels. At 11:15 it was 48 and a half taels. Retail households and others chased in, which was 52 taels. Suddenly, it was heard that Mumbai had increased by four annas, retreating to 48 taels and 5 mace, and returning to 50 and a half taels. Xiexing Yong and others came out, so the market closed at 49 taels and 5 mace, and the revealed price was changed to 719 taels, calculating a pressure of 60 taels to 70 taels.</p>
<p>After-Market Intends to Raise Large Discounts. The after-market opened at 50 taels and 05 mace, and Hengchang Yongheng Xingda Decheng and others bought in until 2:15 it was 54 taels and 5 mace. The Dalian gang slightly came out, and it was 51 and a half taels. In a moment, Zhifeng Yongyuan Dayong Yuanmao Yongxie Xingyong and others came in, and Huashang Bank absorbed 6875 of British gold, and the Japanese bank mutually traded 33.75 US dollars, until 2:45 it was 54 taels and 8 mace. Chengfeng Yongqian Changxiang Fuyu and others sold, and the US dollar bank's purchase price was 9375, and rumors of a bad situation caused panic, and in half an hour it fell by 8 taels. At 3:20 it was 46 taels and 5 mace. In an instant, Zhifeng Yongheng Yu Chengfeng Yong and others successively dragged in, and HSBC and others absorbed 8125 of the March US dollar, so the price rose steadily, rising by as much as 12 taels, and at 4:00 it was 59 taels. It was actually raised by the multilateral in the hope of swapping in. Moreover, there were also many buyers, and the draft was flat, and it fell by more than 6 taels, to 52 and a half taels. At 4:30</p>
<p>The Market Closed at 54 Taels, and Continued Trading at 56 and 7 Taels. Retail investors replenished, but compared to last Saturday, it fell by 15 and a half taels (according to the listed price). According to the maximum price of 61 taels and 5 mace and the minimum price of 39 taels and 5 mace for the day, the difference was 22 taels. The price of goods in the early market was 43 taels, the afternoon closed at 49 taels and 5 mace, and the afternoon closed at 55 taels. The revealed price was estimated to be between 70 taels and 64 or 5 taels. The price entered in the books was 46 taels and 50 mace and 50 taels. The replenishment was 46 taels. In the afternoon, it was 50 taels, and the red bar was calculated to add 6 taels.</p>
<p>Speculation Trends Differ. On the surface, the transaction statistics show that Hengxing, Cuichangyong, Dakang, Yuanmao Yong, Hengchang Yong, and Yifeng Yong all came in. Qian Changxiang, Hengyu, Yuantai, Yu Dayi, Bingxing, Damei Yong, and Fuyu occasionally deposited and withdrew. Zhifeng Yong, Futai Heng, Hongkang Yong, Shunli, Wanxing, Dadecheng, Mr. Wu, and Xiexing Yong all came out. In the afternoon, Dadecheng, Zhiyi Yong, Xiexing Yong, Yuanxing Yong, and Hengxing all came in. Shunli, Tongtaichang, Hongkang Yong, Wanxing, and Qian Changxiang all came out. Hengyu, Yuanmao Yong, Chengfeng Yong, Yifeng Yong, Daxing Yong, and various numbers had very complicated ups and downs. The Guangdong gang bought 400 bars, and the Dalian gang came out with more than 2,000, then entered 600-700 bars.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Trends Loosen</h3>
<p>But the Tightness and Looseness Between Near and Far Periods of British and American Exchange Rates Vary</p>
<p>Foreign Merchants Have Exported Goods, and the Gold Gang Has Thrown Out Most of It</p>
<p>Yesterday, HSBC's listed price had already lengthened by one notch, calculating 25 of British gold, which was 1 shilling 11 pence 75. The US dollar even grew 875, calculating 33.375 yuan, because although the British and American silver markets shrank the day before yesterday, the exchange rate still rose, so the pressure increased. Moreover, the exchange rate between Japan and the United States plummeted by 5.5 cents, calculating 44.5 yuan, which was actually affected by the fact that the new Japanese cabinet had been formed, and the gold export ban was about to be implemented. Also, Hong Kong added 25, to 75.5 taels, and the rest were also longer. As for the internal trend, it was loose, but there was a hovering, because the gold market was tired in the morning and then firm, and the difference between high and low for the whole day was a total of 22 taels, and finally it tended to fall, and the situation was complicated again. When the result was that British gold was longer than last Saturday by 25, and the US dollar was longer by 875, it was the same as the listed price. During this time, foreign merchants have exported goods, and most of the Chinese merchants' gold gangs have thrown them out, and套進gold, calculating that British gold was about 100,000 pounds, and the US dollar was about 1 million yuan. The market situation was also loose because President Hoover's slow payment of war debts was about to be decided.</p>
<p>British Exchange Rate. The internal market has 3125 ups and downs, the loosest price is 2 shillings, and the tightest morning price is 1 shilling 11 pence 6875. The asking price in the morning is about 2 shillings to 1 shilling 11 pence 875, and the buying price is increased by 0625. China-France and Oriental対做March 2 shillings, Dehua asks for 1 month 11 pence 875, Maihang and 大英対做March 6875 Mitsui and Sumitomo enter 1 month 8125 (沙生 out), Zhejiang enters April 6875, the afternoon closes with an asking price of 8125 to 75, and a buying price of 875 to 8125. In the afternoon, Anda and Mitsui互做1 month 875, Zhejiang enters April 6875, Maihang enters April at the same price, the market closes with an asking price of 8125 to 625, and a buying price of 875 to 6875. The near term is looser than the far term, so the swap difference is as much as 1875.</p>
<p>American Exchange Rate. The internal market has a half-yuan rise and fall, the loosest is 34.0625 yuan, and the tightest is 33.625 yuan. In the morning, the asking price is about 33.75 yuan, and the buying price is 875. Hua Yi asks and HSBC enters March 34.0625 yuan, HSBC and Hua Yi sell to 正金and 大通March 34 yuan, Shanghai enters 33.625 yuan, Mitsui and HSBC対做5625, Zhejiang and HSBC also対做1 month at the same price, Sumitomo, Mitsui, and 華比互做March 625, Shanghai buys 625, 大英enters 1 month 75, Mitsui enters March 625, the afternoon closes with an asking price of 75 to 875, and a buying price of 875 to 34 yuan.

The near term is tight and the far term is loose, which is the opposite of British gold. One US dollar is equal to two taels of silver 9 mace 625.</p>
<h3>Foreign Interest Rates Stagnant, Silver Root Tight</h3>

<h3>Securities and Bonds Present Serious Situation Again</h3>
<p>Various Bonds Have Fallen to the Standard Limit Price</p>
<p>The Future Situation is Really Worth Paying Attention To</p>
<p>January Period Has All Opened Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday, the securities and bonds market situation of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, although there were still many kinds of spot goods opening, the turnover was less than before. Only 15,000 yuan was opened throughout the day. The futures December period was still very quiet, and there were still only sporadic transactions in the market, and the market continued to lack vitality. Although the auction has been open for half a month, the futures for January, which have not had a transaction, suddenly all opened yesterday, but the turnover was not much. It is estimated that the transaction volume of the futures for the next month period was about 1.7 million yuan in the morning and afternoon, totaling 3.395 million yuan. As for the situation of various bonds, the trend was generally still quite moderate, and there were no major ups and downs compared with before. The fluctuations between the various markets were very slight. As a result, compared with the previous week, except for the spot goods of the demobilization and reduction of troops, which fell by 3.4 yuan, the futures also fell by 1.2 yuan, and the 20-year open roll spot goods fell by about 1 yuan each. The others were mostly only half a yuan or so. However, judging from the market situation, it was more uneasy than before. After the reorganization of the Japanese cabinet, its attitude towards us was still extremely barbaric, and the conspiracy to invade continued the previous pattern, and France also had news of窥边, so the diplomatic situation was very pessimistic. In addition, within the country, 80 million financial bonds have been issued. All these things have a huge relationship with the bond market environment. The general public in the market is increasingly difficult to be optimistic, investors are watching and not moving forward, the lack of needs has increased, and the retail households who sell at the pain are still not lonely. Therefore, the bonds have become more and more depreciated. It is found that yesterday's market price of various bonds, except for the entire six customs tax reduction and demobilization 96, have all fallen to the lowest limit price set by the former ministry. If we do not urgently seek relief, the bond market will temporarily stop trading invisibly, and disputes will also arise. Therefore, the future of the securities market in the day is worth paying attention to.</p>

<h3>This Month's Yarn, Yarn Alone Is Smart</h3>
<p>The Rest Are Uniformly Flat and Tired</p>
<p>The yarn market is flat and tired, and the trend is abnormally weak. Due to the chaos in national affairs and the urgency of finance, people's hearts are weak, and the overall situation is softened. The current yarn sales are quite clear. Because the silver root is difficult to loosen, the gangs have no purchasing power. However, the Sichuan gang has a very large intention to enter, but the lack of silver root cannot be smoothly handled. Therefore, sporadic transactions are still uninterrupted.</p>
<p>There are too many scattered shorts in this month's yarn. People mark the market opening, and the market is very soft due to the lack of activity in the gold market. However, this month, due to too many scattered shorts, it rose by 3.4 qian, and the far-term fell by 3.5 qian. In the afternoon, this month rose by 2.4 qian again, and the far-term fell by 1.2.3 qian. The total transaction statistics for the day are 12,600 bales. It is found that Gengfeng sold 2,500 bales, Gongtai 600 bales, Changji 550 bales, and Shenji 450 bales. Heshen bought 1,200 bales, Houfeng 1,200 bales, Yiyu 550 bales, and Yuda 400 bales.

<h3>Cotton Market Pressed Down by Gold Price</h3>
<p>Japan Heavily Bans Gold Exports</p>
<p>The cotton market is flat and tired. Because the overseas cotton market is softening, and Japan is heavily banning gold exports, the gold price is falling sharply, the exchange rate is loose, and people's hearts are panicked. The far month is still flat due to the lack of new throwing households. The near month is relatively weak because the silver root is urgent and the current sales are not moving. However, the Hubei gang is mostly bullish and still unwilling to relax.</p>
<p>Hubei Mark Near Month Falls Three Qian. The exchange's Hubei mark opened in the previous market and was still flat. The gold price fell sharply, the near fell by 1.5 cents, and the far was flat. In the afternoon, this month fell by 1.5 cents again, and the far fell by 5 cents to 1 qian. The total transaction statistics for the day were 29,700 dan. It is found that Shenchang sold 4,000 dan, Yuanda 1,600 dan, Changfeng 1,600 dan, and Gongtai 1,900 dan. Jifeng bought 2,300 dan, Yuda 1,600 dan, Changji 1,300 dan, Yiyu 1,000 dan, Xiesheng 1,600 dan, and Yongchang 1,000 dan. The closing price of the Hubei mark is listed on the left.</p>

<h3>Indian and British Cotton Industry Weekly News</h3>
<p>Mumbai. Last week, the market situation was very firm due to the small and delayed harvest of Pingguoer and Aomula. Buyers could not but offer good prices to meet the needs. It is reported that the harvest of Bailan Creek is good. Friday's decline was due to Japan's abandonment of the gold standard and the large-scale sale by Japanese exporters. In the spot market, exporters buy Pilar and new cotton from the Central Provinces. Local manufacturers buy American cotton. European exporters have no hope of asking at this higher price.

<p>Liverpool. Last week, the spot market transaction was very good, and the futures were still flat despite the rumors that Japan would abandon the gold standard. At the beginning of the week, it was firm due to the American cotton government's report that it was beneficial to the bulls, and then immediately softened. The Southern Cotton Hoarding Movement continued, but it was difficult to rise due to financial relations and business stagnation. The financial meeting in Pesler hopes to solve this problem. The Egyptian cotton market situation is sluggish, and fine down cotton is not easy to sell.</p>
<h3>Grain, Both North and South Rice Markets are Still Light</h3>
<p>South Head. Yesterday's source was still lonely, about ten numbers, but Pu's stock was not weak. The city and rural stores sold, but the situation was not good, the silver root was extremely tight, and it was also the end of the month to collect accounts. People's hearts were more calm. Each industry had no greed. They all held a small size. Thick new Japonica rice fell a corner. Thin rice had abundant stock. There were few transactions in this street. The Nning stomach was each. The market price was temporarily stable. Although the trend was thin, the market trend was firm due to the scarcity of goods.</p>
<p>News. The sales of various goods are still light. The source of the West Road is still strong. The stock of goods shipped downstream of the Suzhou River is abundant. Because the weather has turned cold, each rice shop is unwilling to add more, fearing that it will be lower. It is also unknown. People's hearts are slightly flat. West New Thin Rice is each one corner short. Yangfu Jiantao sold two flat. The change of Yin Yuan to Ji has limited. The wine stomach moved without vibration. Zero delivery is also mediocre. The price has no honor or disgrace.</p>
<h3>The Spot Foreign Rice Price Falls and Moves</h3>
<p>Fall Small Corner Permission This Guest Continues to Handle</p>
<p>Yesterday's Foreign Rice Market Situation. Because the situation was not good and people's hearts were shaken, foreign firms had a sale, but no one asked for it. The spot goods were solid and also pale. The market was sluggish and similar to the futures. However, the goods owner was willing to devalue and seek to get rid of it. As a result, the market price was a small corner, and the sales began to be lively. This street's handling intention was stronger. The Hubei gang also asked for the market opening about 5,000, and the small squeeze accounted for seven-tenths, priced at 9 yuan 56 corners, followed by 9 yuan 24 points, and No. 1 Saigon 10 yuan 09 corners and a half to 10 yuan 08 corners and 2 points.</p>
<h3>Flour Manufacturers Dump in Large Quantities</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Flour Market Presented an Initial Determination to Continue Falling. In the morning, because the quotation of foreign wheat was 23 corners or so, people's hearts were still stable. When it came to the afternoon of each market, there was a drastic change in the gold market, and the exchange rate suddenly grew. Most people's hearts were agitated again, and several major factories dumped 200,000 or 300,000 bags again, causing people's hearts to be weak and all were depressed. Observing the subsequent steps, if the gold market falls again, it will still be difficult to see good. As a result, this month fell 1 point compared to the previous week, January fell 1 point, February and March each fell 1.5 points, April fell 1 point and 2 li half, and May fell 1 point and a half.</p>
<h3>This Month's Wheat Bulls Dump Fiercely</h3>
<p>Lowest Level Three Taels Two Qian Half</p>
<p>Yesterday's Date Wheat Market. After the opening of the market in the morning and afternoon, the market situation of each month generally presented the phenomenon that the near term was more miserable and the far term was also depressed. This month, because it will soon be delivered, the exchange's actual chips were heard to be quite surging. On the receiving side, the factory has not yet moved, causing the bulls to be difficult to firmly reject. After the asking price, it fell step by step. The lowest price at the closing was actually three taels and two qian half. This kind of market value has the feeling that goods are not worth the money. January is soft because it is the end of the lunar year. The far term is still stable. As a result, this month fell 5 points compared to the previous week, January fell 4 points, February did not move, March fell 2 points, April fell 1 point, and May initially opened at 3 taels 7 qian 3 fen, and then fell 1 point.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Taikoo Sugar Stock Thin, Market Stable</h3>
<p>Coarse Sand White Sinks Again</p>
<p>Yesterday's Sugar Market Production Area Telegrams Did Not Arrive. The market drawing plate of the Association was still sporadic, and the transaction was still sporadic. Dutch Sugar No. 24 Coarse Sand White fell to 9 taels 7 qian, Medium Sand White 9 taels 6 qian, Cotton Dutch White 11 taels 2 qian transaction was not much, and the trend was still weak. Although Taikoo Sugar Market slightly挫, the import and export was still active. B Mark 11 taels 6 qian half to 2 fen half, DY Mark 11 taels 6 qian, HX Mark 11 taels 5 qian to 4 qian 7 fen half, HM Mark 11 taels 3 qian half, the market shape was still stable, because the market stock was very thin.</p>
<h3>Unprocessed Tung Oil Market</h3>
<p>Since the arrival of new tung oil, prices in various production areas have gradually risen. However, the oil arriving in Hankou is still mostly old oil. This is due to the shallow water levels in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River during the winter, which inevitably causes transportation delays, preventing the new oil from arriving in abundance. The number of foreign firms operating in Hankou remains small. Prices reached 23 taels and 23 mace per foreign standard the previous week but eased slightly to 23 taels to 22 taels and 78 mace per foreign standard last week. Domestic sales by old established oil merchants are priced at 18 taels per foreign standard. Local oil and hemp businesses mainly sell Zhejiang tung oil, so they do not pay much attention to the ups and downs of the Hankou market. When new Zhejiang tung oil first appeared, it was priced at 31 yuan sent to Shanghai per tan, then dropped to 30 yuan. Recently, it has been worth about 29 yuan. It is said that oil mills in the Jin, Qu, Lan, and Yong areas must first press cypress oil, and only after the cypress carriage rush has passed can they start pressing tung oil. Therefore, only a small amount of new oil appears at first, and after the winter solstice, they can all switch to pressing tung oil. According to recent detailed letters from Jin, Lan, and other places, shipments have gradually increased, but the price is still about 28 yuan and several jiao per Lan exchange. If it arrives in Shanghai, it is still around 30 yuan. Therefore, few local businesses are willing to buy, and most are waiting for the price to drop slightly below 29 yuan before entering the market. Since the price has reached this point, there is no need to worry about further declines. However, without large-scale outlets for foreign firms, it is difficult to expect significant improvements. During the arrival of new oil, the market seems to be characterized by prolonged weakness and short-term rallies. Even if there are fluctuations, they will only be within a range of one or two yuan. Local inventories are not abundant, and sales are sluggish due to the winter season. However, preparations for the New Year goods have not yet been made, so a batch of purchases must be made within the lunar year to supply the brisk sales during the New Year season.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Overseas Silk Telegrams Not Forwarded</h3>
<p>Both Chinese and Foreign Silk Merchants Take a Wait-and-See Attitude</p>
<p>Yesterday, although the local foreign firms' silk market was bolstered by rising overseas Japanese silk prices, and market sentiment turned firm, the spot and futures silk telegrams sent to Europe and America in the middle of last week were not forwarded yesterday. Both Chinese and foreign parties adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Yesterday, only Xingdeng bought 10 bales of lower-grade white silk, and Kechang bought 12 bales of Hubei yellow silk, with prices remaining flat and weak.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods Red and Black Dates Rise and Fall Interchangeably</h3>
<p>Tianjin red dates are becoming tighter in the Shanghai market due to rising land prices in the production area. Top-grade red dates are priced at 13 to 14 taels, second-grade at 11 to 12 taels, second-grade red at 9 taels, third-grade red at 7 taels, ordinary miscellaneous goods are at a flat level, Fu red dates are at 7 and a half taels, Hao red dates are at 9 and a half taels, and Jixin red dates are at 8 taels and 6 qian. Sales in various trade associations remain active. However, black dates have seen a decline. Lower-grade goods from Fujian, including Fuzhou, Xiamen, and Xinghua, have been traded. Yesterday, top-grade black dates sold for 17 taels, with subsequent grades ranging from 15 and a half taels to 10 taels. The trend is flat.</p>
<h3>Hardware Company Iron Market Revives</h3>
<p>The trade in Company iron has gradually seen a turnaround recently. This is because exporting groups, such as those in Qingdao and Yantai, have shown some activity, and manufacturers are worried that the market standards will rebound, so they are taking steps to purchase. Although the hardware market has been quiet for days, a total of four to five hundred boxes have been traded. The market price for old steel mills is 28 taels and 5 qian, new steel mills at 27 taels and 5 qian, and French goods at 25 taels. Compared to previous standards, each has improved by two or three qian.</p>

<h3>Important Meeting of Beijing-Guangdong Representatives Yesterday</h3>
<p>Chen Mingshu Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning and Returned to Beijing Last Night</p>
<p>Sun Ke Discusses the Issue of Contacting Jiang's Resignation</p>
<p>Telegrams to Hu Hanmin and the Guangdong Committee Urge Them to Come to Shanghai Quickly</p>
<p>After Chen Mingshu arrived in Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning, he visited Sun Ke at Morrie Road at 9:00 AM yesterday to discuss Jiang's resignation and the Guangdong Committee's trip to Beijing. Chen left at 11:30 AM. He originally planned to take a plane back to Beijing at 12:30 PM yesterday to report back, but the plane's parts were damaged, so he changed to a special train at 10:33 PM last night to return to Beijing.</p>
<p>Resignation Telegram According to sources in Guangdong, Chen Youren was also present during the meeting between Chen and Sun. Chen stated that Chairman Jiang had decided to resign and would formally issue a telegram of resignation on the 15th. At the same time, he would submit his resignation to the Central Standing Committee and request that the Guangdong Committee be telegraphed to come to Beijing quickly so that the Fourth National Congress could be convened as soon as possible to produce a unified government. After Chen left, Sun immediately contacted Wu Chaoshu, Li Wenfan, Zou Lu, and others by telephone to discuss and decided to telegraph Hu Hanmin and the Guangdong Committee to come to Shanghai. They dispersed at 1:00 PM.</p>
<p>Transitional Measures As for the transitional measures after Jiang's resignation, the Central Committee Standing Committee will appoint Lin Sen and Chen Mingshu to temporarily act as Chairman of the National Government and President of the Executive Yuan, respectively. The six representatives staying in Shanghai decided to travel to Beijing together two days after Jiang's telegram is issued to prepare for the Fourth National Congress to be held in Nanjing on the 21st of this month.</p>
<p>He Wu Visits Sun He Yingqin and Wu Tiecheng arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning on the same train as Chen Mingshu and others. In addition to visiting Li Wenfan at 2:30 PM to invite the Guangdong representatives to Beijing, He and Wu also visited Sun Zhesheng in the afternoon to talk and invited Sun to invite the six representatives, Wang, Wu, Chen, Zou, and Li, to go to Beijing together to quickly prepare for the first meeting of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee to be held on the 21st of this month. Wu and He left at 5:30 PM. Sun, Li, Wu, Zou, Chen, and others then drafted a declaration on the current situation and sought Wang's consent. Zou, Wu, and others dispersed at around 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>Sun Ke's Talk After the representatives dispersed, reporters visited Sun Zhesheng. According to him, Chen Zhenru came to Shanghai to report that Jiang had approved the formal telegram of resignation tomorrow (i.e., today) and requested that they go to Beijing. They agreed to go to Nanjing the day after Jiang's resignation (i.e., tomorrow) to prepare for the convening of the first plenary session of the Fourth Central Committee. The meeting has been approved to be held in Nanjing on the 21st of this month. They have telegraphed Guangzhou to ask the committee members to come to Shanghai quickly. He believes that the committee members will rush to leave after receiving the telegram. If the committee members do not arrive in Beijing before the 21st, the opening ceremony will be held first, and they will hold a preparatory meeting to sort out proposals from various parties. As for Jiang's resignation procedures and transitional measures, Jiang will submit his resignation to the Central Standing Committee, and the Central Standing Committee will appoint Lin Sen to act as chairman and Chen Mingshu to temporarily act as president of the Executive Yuan. Military power will likely be taken over by the Ministry of Military Affairs. The remaining items will be announced tomorrow (i.e., today). As for whether Jiang will go to Peiping after his resignation or go elsewhere, it is not yet known. However, it is known that Jiang will attend the Fourth Plenary Session as a member of the Central Committee. Regarding Zhan Tang's arrival in Shanghai, they received a telegram from Hu from Hong Kong the day before yesterday, stating that his blood pressure had increased to 178 degrees, and the doctor instructed him to rest, so he may not be able to come to Shanghai soon. Regarding the incident of French troops causing disturbances on the Yunnan border, when they were in Guangdong, they had received a report stating that French troops and Annamite troops had frequently appeared on the Yunnan and Guangxi borders, and were repairing roads and deploying airfields. The Guangdong side has ordered strict border defense. Zhang Fakui and others can still set off to aid Heilongjiang. This matter was known when he was in Guangdong and will likely be handled by the Fourth Army Group.</p>
<p>Chen Mingshu's Talk Chen Mingshu took a special train back to Beijing at 10:33 last night to report back. This newspaper's reporter interviewed him on the train. According to Chen, the incident of Chairman Jiang's resignation telegram will be discussed and decided after he arrives in Beijing. When asked about the news released by the Guangdong side, Chen's response was extremely vague, saying only, "Wait and see the facts before discussing, there is no need to rush."</p>
<p>Declaration Postponed Yesterday afternoon, the Guangdong representatives decided to jointly publish a statement on the political views after national unification, signed by 31 committee members, including Wang Jingwei, Sun Ke, Wu Chaoshu, Li Wenfan, Zou Lu, Chen Youren, Ju Zheng, Qin Zhen, Xie Chi, Li Liejun, Cheng Qian, Xiong Kewu, Chen Gongbo, Gu Mengyu, Jing Hengyi, Chen Jiayou, Chen Bijun, Liu Luyin, Fang Zhenwu, Gan Naikang, Zhang Zhiben, Fu Rulin, Mao Zuquan, Wang Faqin, Bai Yunti, Pan Yunchao, Zhu Jiqing, Guo Chuntao, Zhao Pilian, Liang Hancao, and Zeng Zhongming. However, because Wang Jingwei did not attend, the original draft was sent to Wang for review. However, after 10:00 PM, Zeng Zhongming and Liu Luyin went back and forth between Wang and Sun to discuss it many times, and it still needed to be revised, so a decision could not be made. Therefore, the declaration was suspended from publication. However, according to Liu Luyin, it may still be published tomorrow.</p>
<h3>The First Batch of Demonstrating Groups from Various Universities Went to Beijing Yesterday</h3>
<p>More Than 500 People Departed First</p>
<p>Taking Ordinary Passenger Trains to Beijing</p>
<p>Order and Spirit Were Neat</p>
<p>Representatives of the demonstrating groups from various universities in the city gathered at the North Station at 10:00 AM yesterday. By 2:00 PM, the demonstrating groups from various schools had arrived one after another, totaling more than 500 people. An emergency meeting of representatives was convened at the temporary office of the group at the North Station to discuss everything and contact the transportation matters. Representatives from the Telecommunications School and four other schools were appointed to negotiate with Guo Chengen, Director of the Railway Bureau. As a result of the discussion, they were allowed to go to Beijing on passenger trains as a sign of accommodation. The departure was allowed at 4:30 PM. Fifty members of the Fudan University Military Police maintained order in the station. The group members all wore uniforms, and the commanders of each school wore white armbands. The General Affairs Office prepared a general flag with the words "Shanghai University Student Demonstration Group," which was very eye-catching. About thousands of people from all walks of life came to watch and send them off, and the order was well-maintained. At about 5:00 PM, the representatives of each school and the Fudan Military Police returned to their respective schools, and their spirits were quite radiant and solemn. The details of their departure are recorded below:</p>
<p>Persuasion Ineffective Cai Yuanpei telegraphed Wang Boqun and others from Beijing the day before yesterday, asking them to relay to the presidents of various universities to dissuade the students from going to Beijing. The original telegram read: Rong, Director of the Telegraph Bureau, please immediately forward to Wang Boqun, Zhang Yongni, Li Denghui, Deng Hongnian, Wang Jingqi, Li Zhaohuan, Hu Shuhua, He Shizhen, Zheng Yuxiu, Chu Fucheng, Liu Zhanen, Cao Liangxia, Liu Haisu, Pan Gongzhan, and other gentlemen. According to reports, one-third of the students in Shanghai are scheduled to enter Beijing in the cold weather. Now that the diplomacy has temporarily come to an end after accepting the resolution of the League of Nations, the content and the government's difficulties have been announced. As for domestic affairs, the Fourth Central Committee will soon gather in Beijing to produce a unified government. Coming to Beijing at this time will inevitably have no results. The weather in Beijing has suddenly turned cold, below freezing, and living is difficult. Please invite the presidents and professors of various schools to find ways to dissuade the students from coming to Beijing, and report the progress of the negotiations by telegram. Cai Yuanpei, brother. After receiving this telegram, the presidents of various schools tried to dissuade the students the night before last and yesterday morning, but the students' determination to go was firm, and there was no effect. They resolutely went to Beijing.</p>
<p>Contacting Vehicles At 12:00 AM, representatives from Guanghua contacted Guo Chengen, Director of the Two Railway Bureaus, regarding vehicles for the demonstrating group going to Beijing. According to the response, they received an edict from Chairman Jiang last night (i.e., the 13th) stating that all student groups going to Beijing were not allowed to be released, and no one was allowed to ride the train without a ticket. Violators would be dealt with by military law. If the students insisted on taking the train to Beijing today, the vehicles would be destroyed and not allowed to depart. This was to comply with the edict. Since the negotiation for vehicles by the demonstrating group yielded no results, an emergency meeting of representatives was convened. Fudan, Telecommunications, Liangjiang, and Merchant Marine schools were appointed to be responsible for negotiating with the director of the Railway Bureau. Seeing the strong feelings of the crowd, the director felt unable to stop them by force. As a result of the discussion, a compromise was reached. Since the number of people in the group going to Beijing this time was not large, they could ride on passenger trains. However, the group had to acknowledge that they were forcing their way onto the train, and the bureau would not be responsible for any military intervention or other incidents along the way. The railway could only release as many vehicles as possible for those going to Beijing tomorrow, still operating as passenger trains. If special trains were to be opened, it would be difficult to approve. After the negotiations were completed, the demonstrating group going to Beijing drove away on passenger trains at 4:30 PM.</p>

<p>Meeting of Representatives At 2:00 PM, an emergency meeting of representatives was convened at the temporary office of the demonstrating group of various universities going to Beijing at the North Station. Representatives from 19 schools attended. Tang Gansheng from the Law School presided over the meeting, and Pan Chuji from Fudan recorded the minutes. After the formalities were completed, discussions were held. Matters for discussion and resolution: (1) The Transportation Office, except for Telecommunications, other schools cannot be responsible.

A meeting of representatives will be held at the North Railway Station at 10:00 AM this morning to decide on the policy for going to Beijing. They plan to take the train to Beijing in the afternoon.

<h3>A Record of the Tragic Destruction of the Dada Company's Dade Steamer</h3>
<p>More Than One Hundred People Burned to Death or Drowned</p>
<p>More Than Three Hundred Crew and Passengers Rescued</p>
<p>Second Comprador Burned to Death, Old Engineer Frozen to Death</p>
<p>The Dada Company's Dade steamer, which was traveling from Shanghai to Tongyang, caught fire near Hupu, in a place called Qiwangsha. The entire ship was destroyed. More than one hundred passengers and crew members died after jumping into the river or freezing to death after being rescued. This is the second tragedy for the company after the tragic incident of the Daji. Based on the reporter's investigation, the details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Circumstances of the Fire The Dade steamer's second cabin contained 200 bales of foreign flannel and American cotton, surrounded by more than 400 bags of white sugar. It departed from Shanghai at 1:30 AM on the 13th of this month. It was near Hupu in Changshu, in a place called Qi Huangsha, at 11:40 AM. The crew, sailors, and passengers on the ship were having lunch when smoke suddenly appeared in the cotton cabin. The crew did not know about the fire at first. When it was discovered, black smoke rushed upwards. The sailors immediately reported to the shipowner, Le Changming, who quickly sought to put out the fire. The ship gathered all the crew and sailors, and each took leather belts and firefighting equipment to draw water to spray. By this time, the fire had already broken through the cabin surface and was burning the deck.</p>
<p>Strong Wind and Fierce Fire The two-story deck was made of wooden boards, which ignited immediately. Seeing that the water spraying was ineffective, the shipowner and others took the fire extinguishing chemicals prepared on the ship for emergency use and sprayed them. However, the weather was extremely cold that day, and the wind was particularly strong. After the fire burned the two-story cabin, it spread extremely quickly with the help of the wind. Although there were fire extinguishing chemicals and water from leather belts, they were completely ineffective. After 12:00 PM, the entire two-story cabin was on fire. At this point, the shipowner and others were helpless.</p>
<p>Raising the Flag for Help Shipowner Le Changming frantically pulled the rescue whistle, hoping that passing ships would assist in the rescue, but no one responded. In desperation, they raised the rescue flag again. Meanwhile, crew members risked smoke and fire to reach the upper deck, intending to lower small sampans to rescue the passengers on board. However, before the ropes suspending the sampan could be untied, the fire had already reached the upper deck.</p>
<p>Passengers Jumping into the River According to the company's investigation, the Dade steamer sold tickets for 340 passengers, and about 100 passengers bought tickets after boarding the ship. There were about 120 employees, including crew members and sailors, on the ship, for a total of more than 500 people. After the fire broke out, everyone scrambled in different directions, trying to escape. They rushed to the top of the ship, wanting to release the sampan. However, when the fire reached the upper deck, the passengers, with no way out, jumped into the river, hoping to escape. Many drowned on the spot, and many died from the severe cold.</p>
<p>Driving the Ship Aground Seeing that the entire ship was on fire and beyond repair, the shipowner quickly accelerated and drove the ship into the shallow waters of Qi Huangsha, grounding the ship and then attempting to rescue the passengers. Fortunately, the Taikoo Company's Yichang, Xiangtan, Yihe, and Hehe ships passed by, saw the Dade's rescue flag raised high, and sent sampans into the river to rescue the people who had fallen into the water.</p>
<p>Various Ships Assisting in the Rescue First, two sandboats, seeing the Dade on fire, quickly released four sampans to the Qi Huangsha riverside to salvage the passengers who had fallen into the water. Then, the Yichang, Xiangtan, and Pinghe also released one sampan each, heading to the side of the Dade steamer to rescue the people who had fallen into the water. At 8:00 PM that night, the Shanghai Dada Company received a telegram from Tongzhou, stating that the Yichang and other sampans had rescued more than 100 people, who had landed in Tongzhou. The Xiangtan had also rescued many people, who were to land in Taixing. In Tongzhou, three people had already frozen to death.</p>
<p>Distressed Passengers Arrive in Shanghai According to the company's report, a total of 205 people were rescued by the sandboats. Yesterday morning, the Victoria tugboat, which was sent by Jardine Matheson to the scene of the accident to assist in the rescue on behalf of the customs, brought the sandboat to Shanghai at about 9:00 AM. They all landed in Wusong. Some had already taken the train to Shanghai, and the rest were transported by sandboat. There were also eight bodies, seven men and one woman, which were sent to the Life-Saving Association for burial. At 7:00 PM, another two people who had been rescued on the sandboat outside Wusong were brought by the water patrol team's small steamer and are now being accommodated by the company. Yesterday, the Daqing arrived and also rescued eight people.</p>
<p>Crew Deaths The acting shipowner, Le Changming, and the accountant and five others were rescued by another sandboat to Liuhe and came to Shanghai yesterday to report everything to the company. The comprador, Qi Baorun, had already gone to Yang and did not board the Dade steamer, while the second comprador, Shen Yuncheng, had been burned to death. The old engineer, Xin Lishan, jumped into the river at the time and froze to death after being rescued. Other drivers, sailors, cooks, and tea room staff were either burned to death or drowned. According to people in the company yesterday, the exact number of deaths is unknown, but it is estimated that about 30 people died.</p>
<p>The Ship is Completely Destroyed After the Dade steamer caught fire, the Shanghai company immediately sent the Dayu steamer to assist in the rescue yesterday morning, while Nantong sent the Chuyuan tugboat to assist in everything. Yesterday, the Shanghai Bureau received a follow-up telegram stating that the entire Dade steamer had been burned to a shell. The 200 pieces of American cotton, 400 bags of white sugar, 200 pieces of water tobacco, and other sacks and miscellaneous goods in the cabin were also completely burned. The ship's shell is still stranded in the shallow waters of Qi Huangsha. The Dade steamer has a deadweight of 800 tons and was built in 1891. The loss of the ship and goods is estimated to be between 300,000 and 400,000, and more than 100 passengers and crew members died in the fire.</p>
<p>Company Notice The Dada Company issued a notice to merchants yesterday: "We hereby inform you that our company's Dade steamer, on the schedule of December 12, departed on the evening of 1:30 AM, heading to Tongyang and other places, carrying a total of 1,052 pieces of passenger goods. Unfortunately, at 11:43 AM on the 13th, an accident occurred in Qiwangsha, and all rescue efforts were ineffective. The entire ship was destroyed, leaving only the ship's shell. The Dayu Chuyuan has been sent to the scene of the accident to find ways to tow it back to Shanghai. Please send someone to inspect it. This is a special notice."</p>
<p>Handling of the Aftermath Since receiving the warning telegram the night before last (the 13th), the Nantong branch has been trying to rescue. Shanghai has also sent the Dayu and Chuyuan tugboats, carrying necessary clothing and bedding. It is believed that they have arrived at the scene of the accident. However, in front of the 16th Pier yesterday, the families of the crew members and relatives of the passengers were asking questions, and the crowd was extremely crowded. Some even had confirmed news that their loved ones had already died in the fire or drowned, and they wailed and collapsed on the ground, and the passersby were saddened. The company is carrying the bodies and sending them to the Tongren Fuyuantang for coffin burial. The surviving passengers are being registered by the Jiaotong Chongru Township Association. Because most of them are anxious to go home, the passengers who were rescued and returned to Shanghai and landed in Songjiang did not wait to register and left first. Therefore, it is impossible to confirm who is alive and who is dead. The Daqing, which arrived yesterday, did not rescue any personnel. It is said that there will be accurate information on how many died when the Daiwa arrives in Shanghai today.</p>
<h3>Letter from the Municipal Party Department to All Party Members in the City</h3>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Party Department issued a letter to all Party members in the city yesterday, stating: "Since the outbreak of the September 18th Incident in Shenyang, the public's anger has grown day by day. Our Party Department first telegraphed the Central Government to unite against the enemy and has spared no effort to lead and support the anti-Japanese national salvation movement of the masses. This has long been known to all our comrades in the city. However, since the 9th, conflicts have occurred between students and the masses. A few corrupt elements have taken advantage of the opportunity and hijacked a part of the students, and have wantonly disturbed and violently destroyed our Party Department, even the portrait of the General Manager and the national flag hanging in the main hall of our headquarters have been damaged, and they have shouted slogans such as 'Down with the Kuomintang' and 'Seize Power.' This kind of perverse behavior not only damages the national strength but also fosters chaos and causes endless harm. All our comrades in the city should inspire and unite to work together to correct it. However, a few people in this city who have been harboring different intentions, and a part of corrupt Party members who have been expelled or suspended, have taken advantage of the opportunity to take advantage of the fire and dare to destroy the law and disrupt discipline. At 9:00 AM on the 13th of this month, they held a so-called city-wide Party member conference at the Shanghai College of Political Science and Law. Only the illegal Party members who coveted the Party's power, in order to destroy the Party's organization, disrupt the Party's affairs, and confuse the comrades, destroyed the Party's grassroots foundation, and were extremely crazy. Not to mention that they only borrowed a corner of the college, and only about three or four hundred people actually attended, and most of them were non-Party members mixed in. Even if the number of people as touted by those villains is multiplied tenfold, it is still legally unfounded according to the Party's constitution. In addition to investigating the corrupt elements who privately convened and participated in illegal gatherings, and requesting the Central Government to thoroughly investigate and eliminate internal spies to maintain discipline, this meeting urgently informs all our comrades in the city to firmly believe, unite sincerely, eliminate reactionaries, and consolidate the Party's foundation. Those who have participated but were coerced or incited are allowed to come to the meeting to explain the truth and will not be discussed. Please do not go astray. Furthermore, all the executive and supervisory committee members of our Party Department have already telegraphed the Central Government to resign due to the difficulty of work, but until a clear order is approved, they will naturally"</p>
<h3>Joint Declaration by District Party Headquarters</h3>
<p>Denial of the Party Affairs Improvement Committee</p>
<p>The First, Second, Fifth, Sixth, Ninth, and Tenth District Party Headquarters of this city yesterday jointly declared their denial of the so-called Party Affairs Improvement Committee. They stated, "Having seen in the newspapers a news item about an emergency meeting of city-wide party members convened at the College of Law and Politics, we are deeply astonished. Aside from the fact that the meeting was attended by only thirty or forty people, and that many non-party members were mixed in, which disqualifies it as a city-wide party member meeting, according to the procedures, a city-wide party member meeting can only be convened upon the instruction of the Central Executive Committee, or when the Municipal Executive Committee deems it necessary, or when more than half of the District Executive Committees deem it necessary, and is convened by the Municipal Executive Committee as a temporary meeting. According to the general regulations, a meeting is convened annually. Now, the relevant agencies have not heard of any intention to convene the so-called city-wide party member emergency meeting. Therefore, the meeting is fundamentally illegal, and is clearly a reactionary element taking advantage of the opportunity, using a false name, attempting to disrupt the party system, and engaging in disruptive conspiracies. As this concerns party discipline, in addition to reporting it to the higher authorities for thorough investigation, we hereby solemnly declare our denial of the illegal meeting and its so-called Party Affairs Improvement Committee, to rectify the public perception and avoid confusion. We hope for public discernment. The First, Second, Fifth, Sixth, Ninth, and Tenth District Executive Committees of Shanghai Special Municipality."</p>
<h3>Meeting of the Executive Committee of the Municipal Party Affairs Improvement Committee</h3>
<p>The Executive Committee of the Shanghai Special Municipality Party Affairs Improvement Committee of the Kuomintang of China held its first Executive Committee meeting at 8:00 PM yesterday. All committee members were present, with Wang Hanliang as chairman and Xing Wan as secretary. After the chairman's report, the meeting immediately began to discuss important resolutions as follows: (1) Regarding the proposal of the General Assembly to support Mr. Wang Jingwei's National Salvation Conference and advocate the publication of a declaration, it was resolved to approve it. (2) Regarding the General Assembly's resolution to oppose secret diplomacy and severely punish Zhang Xueliang, and how to implement it, it was resolved to issue a circular telegram. (3) Regarding the General Assembly's resolution to send representatives to express sympathy to the students of Peking University and National Central University who were beaten, it was resolved to appoint comrades Zhu Chengzi and Zhang Juansheng to go.

(5) Regarding the drafting of the provisional regulations of the organization, it was resolved to appoint comrades Chen Baixin and Li Zheng to be responsible for drafting and submitting it to the next meeting for revision. (6) Regarding the drafting of the people's movement plan, it was resolved to appoint comrades Zhang Tinghao and Qian Zanting to draft and submit it to the next meeting for revision. (7) Regarding the proposal to publish a declaration by the committee, it was resolved to approve it. The meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Joint Declaration of All Labor Unions in the City Regarding the Current Situation</h3>
<p>The Municipal Party Headquarters Must Be Reorganized</p>
<p>Oppose Reorganization, Support the Party Affairs Improvement Committee</p>
<p>More than seventy labor unions in this city, including the Municipal Postal Workers Union, Postal Service Union, Fourth District Cigarette Union, Sixth District Water and Electricity Union, Seventh District Cotton Textile Union, Dyeing Industry Union, Pharmaceutical Industry Union, Steamboat Carpentry Union, Pharmaceutical Trade Union, Newspaper Delivery Union, First District Sanitation Union, Fifth District Match Union, Fourth District Transportation Union, Qin Industry Union, Silk Finishing Office of the Dyeing Industry Union, Leather Manufacturing Union, First District Shipbuilding Union, Second District Cotton Textile Union, Hat Making Union, Civil Steamboat Carpentry Union, Wine Making Union, Fifth District Shipbuilding Union, Ninth District Soap and Pharmaceutical Union, Egg Industry Union, Sixth District Cotton Textile Union, Sixth District Knitting Industry Union, Fourth District Sanitation Union, Ink Making Union, Garment Making Union, Dongjiadu Ferry Union, Fifth District Cotton Spinning Union, Fragrance Industry Union, Sanpin Dyeing Industry Union, First District Shipbuilding Union, Second District Silk Weaving Union, First District Rubber Industry Union, Silk Spitting Industry Union, Second District Knitting Industry Union, Fourth District Silk Weaving Union, Sixth District Public Bus Industry Union, Sauce Industry Union, etc., yesterday convened an emergency joint meeting regarding the incident at the Student Federation and the recent party affairs disputes, and issued a solemn declaration. The declaration was addressed to party headquarters at all levels, organizations, newspapers, and compatriots throughout the country. It stated, "Since the September 18th Incident, the party headquarters and the government have initially made mistakes, then procrastinated, and finally suppressed, viewing the patriotic movement of the people as a fierce flood. As in the recent December 9th incident at the Shanghai Student Federation, the responsible persons of the municipal party headquarters and the municipal Public Security Bureau brazenly and madly used brutal methods unseen in the world, binding and beating students, forming an unprecedented tragedy, and creating a stain on the history of the revolution. The people, under years of high pressure, are now suffering from the deep sorrow of this unprecedented national crisis, going from hope to pleading, from pleading to blaming, and reaching the last day of despair. The foundation of the party has been shaken, and the prestige of the party has been swept away. The root cause of past failures is not in the Three People's Principles themselves, but in the vast majority of shameless people who use the party for personal gain, commit evil deeds recklessly, and allow the country to be destroyed and the principles to be abandoned, while personal interests must be fought for. The party and the principles have been gradually eroded and corrupted by these evil forces for years. Those people conspire for personal gain and engage in malfeasance, ultimately blaming the party. They hold the power but blame the party for the consequences. The pioneers of our party have painfully pointed this out. Today, the eastern provinces have been brutally trampled, the Japanese invaders are advancing step by step, and the poor people are suffering and crying out, all wanting to serve the country and die, but are being taken advantage of by shameless and unconscionable people, who seize the opportunity to satisfy their selfish desires for short-term committee positions, while ignoring the party's laws and the country's survival. Alas, the late Premier Sun Yat-sen initiated the Three People's Principles to save the country through the party, but less than seven years after his death, the country has been injured and the party has been robbed. If he has a spirit in the afterlife, can he not weep and shed tears? This association laments the imminent destruction of the country and the decay of the party's governance. It will abide by the government's intentions and be a vanguard for all sectors of society. Now that the situation has reached this point, it is no longer time for us to sit idly by. Therefore, we sincerely appeal to our beloved compatriots throughout the country, 'To resist foreign aggression, we must first secure the country internally.' This is a precedent in history. The way to secure the country internally is to save the country, and the way to save the party is to eliminate traitors. The past municipal party headquarters must be reorganized. However, taking advantage of the resignation of all members of the municipal party headquarters, the so-called Party Affairs Improvement Committee has been organized. In terms of procedure, it does not conform to the principles of democratic centralism. In terms of personnel selection, most are either former members of the municipal party headquarters or people of lost moral character. This kind of improper combination can only shake the faith of the party and is not enough to lead the people of the city. For the sake of saving the party, this association vows to deny this meeting and hopes that all revolutionary people in the city will unanimously advocate and rise up to correct it. This is the first point. Young students, with ardent blood and sincerity, do not complain about hunger or cold, and call for the nation. Their patriotic spirit and determination have created a new record in the history of the student movement. However, the authorities insult them with dirty hearts, which is heartbreaking. We hope that the officials who are ordered to be responsible for investigating this case will conduct a thorough investigation impartially to calm public anger. This is the second point. Since the September 18th Incident, months have passed, and the authorities have been negligent before and after the event. If this continues, the situation will become even more difficult to manage. This association still maintains its previous proposal and urges Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek to swear an oath and go north immediately to recover the lost territories by force, and to urge the Guangdong committee members to go to the capital as soon as possible to actively prepare for self-defense, reorganize national affairs, and revitalize party affairs. This is the third point. These three points are essential for saving the party and the country, and cannot be delayed. If the government authorities continue to delay, act like barbarians, and remain unrepentant, ignoring the calls of the people and failing to save the country from danger, then the people of the whole country will surely rise up together. The time is critical, and it is fleeting. This association leads all workers in the city and works together with our beloved compatriots from all walks of life to achieve our goals. We hereby declare."</p>
<h3>Gentry and Merchants Host the Student Community Yesterday</h3>
<p>Willing for Students' Fathers and Elder Brothers to Assume Responsibility for Saving the Nation</p>
<p>Yesterday at 3:00 PM, gentry and merchants Yu Qiaqing, Shi Liangcai, Wang Xiaolai, Qin Runqing, Yuan Ludeng, Li Cishan, Xu Jiqing, Zhang Gongquan, Zhang Xiaolin, Du Yuesheng, Liu Hongsheng, Lu Bohong, Xu Xinliu, Wei Tingrong, Hu Mengjia, Chen Guangfu, and Lin Kanghou, gathered the principals of various universities and middle schools in Shanghai and the Shanghai Student Anti-Japanese National Salvation United Association, the Student Anti-Japanese National Salvation United Association of various middle schools, and two student representatives from various middle schools in the city at the Shaoxing Fellow Countrymen Association on Avenue Edward VII to hold a discussion meeting. Those who attended included Liu Zhan'en of Shanghai University, He Shizhen of Chih Tze College, Chu Minyi of the Sino-French National Institute of Technology, Xu Peihuang of the Central University Business School, Hu Shuhua of Tongji University, Wang Jingqi of Labor University, Chu Huiseng of Law School, College of Law and Politics, China Women's Physical Education School, Southeast Medical College, National Conservatory of Music, Shanghai Art College, Liangjiang Women's Physical Education School, Daxia University, Guanghua University, China Vocational School, Surveying and Mapping School, Gongshi School, Cai Guo Jingluan, Quanzhang Middle School, Chen Guichen, Minzhi School, Chu Shichao of Shanghai Girls' Middle School, Shenmei Girls' Middle School, Hubbei Middle School, Choufan Girls' Middle School, Sanyu Middle School, Yucai Middle School, Yuqing Middle School, Xinmin Middle School, Guangdong Middle School, Shibei Middle School, Huideng Girls' Middle School, Nanyang Girls' Middle School, Mingde Middle School, Dongwu Second Middle School, Chengzong Middle School, Xiejin Middle School, Nanfang Middle School, Qinghua Middle School, Huiling Middle School, Nanyang Normal Middle School, McLaren Middle School, Fudan Benchen Middle School, Guangzhao Middle School, Qingxin Middle School, Jianguo Middle School, Junyi Middle School, Daxia Middle School, Datong Affiliated Middle School, Huaisi Junior High School, Zhirenyong Middle School, Peiming Girls' Middle School, Minsheng Middle School, Shanghai Provincial Middle School, Minli Girls' Middle School, Minguo Girls' Middle School, Qixiu Girls' Middle School, Lida College, and principals and students from about 200 schools such as Zhaoji, Huahua, YMCA, Dongfang, Zhengxin, Zhengfeng, Qianye, Tiehua, Aiqun, Pudong, etc. Yu Qiaqing first gave an opening speech, Wang Xiaolai said that all sectors should fulfill their responsibilities in the anti-Japanese incident. Lin Kanghou said that the garrison headquarters and the Public Security Bureau in Shanghai are still lacking responsible persons, and the financial sector is showing instability. Shi Liangcai said that the fundamental solution to resist Japan is to seek China's prosperity. Agricultural science, industrial mechanization, and large-scale companies should be established in the industry to enrich the people and make China strong. Li Cishan said that China is vast and difficult to unify. Countries in the world, such as the United States and Russia, are federal states. In the past, Yuan Shikai and Wu Peifu wanted to unify by force, but could not. Therefore, considering the situation, a federal system is also appropriate. Chu Fucheng said that the students' strike is due to the lack of a study environment. However, if the children are to study with peace of mind, their fathers and elder brothers must assume responsibility for saving the nation. Hu Shuhua also advocated that the schools resume classes first. Lin Kanghou also said that it is admirable that the students are engaged in the national salvation movement. However, in the current unstable situation, one should not neglect to prevent the Communist Party and Japanese spies from taking the opportunity to disturb the situation, and should be cautious. We deeply hope that a unified and responsible government will be realized immediately. It would be fortunate if we did not have to wave flags and shout again, and we would like to meet with you again soon to see the success of this hope. Then, a representative of Fudan students explained the petition process. Representatives of the Anti-Japanese Association of various middle schools stated that their fathers and elder brothers would be deeply comforted if they could assume responsibility for saving the nation, but they were deeply concerned that they might not be able to fulfill their responsibilities. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Zou Lu Delivers a Speech Responding to the National Salvation Conference</h3>
<p>Jointly Plan to Deal with the Current National Crisis</p>
<p>Elect Representatives to Participate in Politics</p>
<p>End the Tutelage and Realize Constitutional Government</p>
<p>Since Mr. Wang Jingwei launched the National Salvation Conference, responses have sprung up from all sides. Yesterday, Guangdong representative Zou Haibin also delivered a speech regarding this matter, saying, "Since Mr. Wang Jingwei launched the National Salvation Conference, there has been unanimous support from all sides. Mr. Hu Zhantang has supplemented the organizational composition and other aspects, and his eagerness to promote its success is especially evident. I also absolutely support Mr. Wang Jingwei's proposal. However, in this critical period, I intend to expand its nature and responsibilities. The so-called expansion of the nature means that this conference should not only deal with the current situation, but also determine the future political system, combining the nature of both the National Conference and the National Assembly as defined by the Premier. Therefore, its responsibilities should focus on the following three points: (1) Jointly plan to deal with the current national crisis. (2) Elect representatives to participate in central politics. (3) Serve as the pivot for ending the tutelage and realizing constitutional government. There is a need to explain the nature of this conference. Internal and external troubles have reached their peak today. The reasons for this are varied, but political autocracy and separation from the public, where the public does not know the measures taken by the government and increasingly distrust it, are major reasons. Therefore, the current national crisis requires the joint efforts of the people, and future politics should be shouldered by the people. Especially in this critical time of survival, constitutional government must be implemented as soon as possible. If held separately, it would be prolonged and unable to respond to this national crisis. Since the representatives are elected by the people, there seems to be no need for such a redundant move. Therefore, the nature and proposals of this National Salvation Conference embody the meaning of both the Premier's National Conference and National Assembly. The three responsibilities of this conference can be explained separately. (1) Dealing with the current national crisis has been elaborated by Mr. Wang Jingwei. Indeed, in recent years, domestic and foreign affairs have not satisfied the people and have not been understood by the people. In terms of diplomacy, why has the withdrawal of Japanese troops from Jinan been delayed? Why did the Sino-Soviet war occur? Why have there been hundreds of cases involving the Northeast? Since the Japanese invasion, why has there been no resistance? Why has the establishment of a neutral zone in Jinzhou and the request for joint administration of Tianjin been widely reported in Chinese and foreign newspapers? In terms of domestic affairs, how have the Communists caused such a phenomenon? Why has the suppression of the Communists become more intense? Why has the national debt exceeded 100 million? Where is the purpose of all the money? Floods are indeed natural disasters, but why has the prevention and disaster relief work in various provinces suddenly been abandoned? As for all construction, it is nothing more than empty words, and the livelihood of the people has reached its limit. All of this makes the people feel lost. The people do not understand, and the autocracy is getting worse, further isolating the people. This is why the recent national crisis has led the people to passionately resist foreign aggression, while students and workers have mostly criticized the government. If there is no agency to allow the people to participate in and understand all politics, it will be impossible for them to have confidence and work together to overcome the national crisis. (2) Electing representatives to participate in political affairs. Because of political autocracy, the people are alienated and do not trust the government. If the revolution is separated from the people, it will surely fail. To ensure that the government and the people are not alienated, it is essential to have the people elect representatives to participate in central political affairs. This is why the Founding Program stipulates that during the period of tutelage, 'after the establishment of a local autonomous government in each county, one representative may be elected to form a representative assembly to participate in central political affairs.' The current peace conference also pays attention to the participation of national representatives in political affairs, which Mr. Sun Zhegeng has clearly stated. When the people suspect the government of political issues, there is no other way to make the people understand the government and trust the government. At the same time, the government cannot combine with the people and stand together on the revolutionary front. (3) Ending the tutelage and realizing constitutional government. Although it has been called tutelage for years, nothing has been done in accordance with the Premier's methods for the period of tutelage. Instead, the name of tutelage has been used to create responsibility for autocracy. This is why the people have been criticizing the tutelage recently. Moreover, the matter of tutelage is most prone to despotism. Unless it is carried out with the Premier's selfless spirit, it will inevitably lead to abuses. As the saying goes, 'If you have the ambition of Yi Yin, you can do it; if you do not have the ambition of Yi Yin, you should not do it.' Mr. Sun Zhegeng advocates realizing constitutional government as soon as possible. I believe that his political proposals over the years have been along the same lines. If constitutional government can be realized as soon as possible, and the people of the whole country can concentrate their will and talents under constitutional government to save the current national crisis and determine the future political system, this will be the Premier's will to complete the revolution and the eternal achievement of the Republic of China. The above are my supplementary opinions on Mr. Wang Jingwei's National Salvation Conference. Mr. Wang Jingwei is currently drafting an organizational plan for the National Salvation Conference, providing detailed rules and regulations. There will surely be more detailed and better methods to meet the expectations of the nation and lay the foundation for the Republic of China. We are willing to wait and see with the people."</p>
<h3>Responses to Wang Jingwei's Telegram</h3>
<p>Jiangsu Promotion Association Telegram: The Jiangsu Promotion Association for the National Salvation Conference sent a telegram, saying, "To all people's organizations and newspapers: Since the Japanese invasion of the eastern provinces, the situation has become increasingly urgent for several months. However, the government has not made active preparations and has not informed the people of the coping strategies. All our compatriots are saddened. We believe that at this critical moment, it is not enough to talk about saving the nation without concentrating the power of the people throughout the country. Recently, we read Mr. Wang Jingwei's telegram, advocating the organization of a National Salvation Conference, with each people's organization sending representatives to jointly plan to deal with the national crisis, which is the only good way to save the country. We have established the Jiangsu Promotion Association for the National Salvation Conference today, vowing to support Mr. Wang's proposal with all our strength and urge its early realization. We hereby send this telegram for your attention. Respectfully, the Jiangsu Promotion Association for the National Salvation Conference."</p>
<p>Anhui Youth National Salvation Corps Telegram: The Anhui Youth National Salvation Corps in Shanghai sent a telegram, saying, "Foreign troubles are pressing, unification has not been achieved, the country is about to perish, and the people have no place to die. Mr. Wang Jingwei believes that the realization of democratic politics is essential to save the party and the country from danger, and therefore initiated the National Salvation Conference. His words are incisive and fit the feelings of the people. There is no other way to revive China. We hope that all compatriots throughout the country will rise up together. In addition to sending a separate telegram to Mr. Wang to announce the organizational plan and detailed regulations, we send this telegram first, and earnestly pray."</p>

<h3>Chopping Off a Child's Head to Pray for a Dream</h3>
<p>Sleeping with the Head as a Pillow Showing No Unusual Signs</p>
<p>How Cruel These "Dahua Hui" Members Are</p>
<p>Near the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway beside the Hanqiao Bridge on Xinmin Road in Zhabei, a man, about thirty years old, was seen carrying a sack and wandering near the tracks at around 6:00 PM last night. After about a few minutes, he threw the sack on the ground and quickly left. The patrol officer there, seeing his suspicious behavior, went forward to investigate and found a child's head inside the sack, which shocked him. He immediately chased after and apprehended the man, taking him to the First Detachment of the Railway Police for interrogation. It was learned that the man's name was Zhu Agou, from Ningbo, and he was a carpenter at the Qiu Guiji Woodworking Shop in Xie Xingli, Gonghe Xin Road, Zhabei. He said that the child's head was used to pray for dreams in the "Dahua Hui." According to his statement, he found a boy's body, about six or seven years old, near the tap water pavilion in Longtoufang, North Station, the day before yesterday. He chopped off the head with an ax in the middle of the night, put it in a sack, and spent the night in a small alley sleeping with the child's corpse as a pillow to pray for a dream. However, he saw nothing unusual, so he sent it back to its original location at about 11:00 AM yesterday, which led to its discovery by the patrol officer. The police are concerned that there may be other motives and will refer him to the court for a thorough investigation.</p>
<h3>The Case of the Nephew Killing His Uncle and Two Others is Solved</h3>
<p>The Murderer Fled to Wuxi</p>
<p>Entrusted Someone to Come to Shanghai to Withdraw Money</p>
<p>The Bank Reported the Arrest and Solved the Case</p>
<p>The Murderer Was Arrested in Wuxi</p>
<p>Wang Jiashun, the owner of Wang Yuanxing Roundwood Shop at No. 1673 Chexi Road, was asleep in the front building with his wife, Zhang, and son, Xingbao, at midnight on the 5th of this month. Suddenly, his nephew, Wang Songfa, sneaked into the bedroom, murdered for money, and hacked Wang Jiashun, his wife, and Xingbao to death with an ax. He stole more than one hundred dollars in cash and a savings account book from the Siming Bank and fled. The Special Court interrogated the case and ordered the police to strictly arrest and bring the murderer to justice, and notified the Siming Bank to stop payment and pay attention to all information. News of this was published in this newspaper. It is now learned that the case was solved by the Huishan Police yesterday. The murderer and suspects have been arrested in Shanghai and Wuxi. Now, the details of the case's solution are recorded below. After the incident, the murderer, Wang Songfa, fled with the bank book. He then, on the previous week,</p>
<p>To Wuxi Zhoushan Port, He stayed temporarily with his friend Feng Song’s family, but Feng was not rich either, so he had to find a way to maintain his livelihood. Wang Songfa took out a savings account book from the Siming Bank and entrusted Feng to go to Shanghai to withdraw the deposit. But Feng did not dare to go alone rashly, so he went with Xie Jinbao, a native of Jiangyin, to Shanghai on the 12th of this month. They stayed overnight in a small inn near the North Station. On the morning of the next day, Feng and Xie went</p>
<p>Together to the Siming Bank to Withdraw the Money. Xie waited outside the door, while Feng entered alone, took out the bank book and handed it to the clerk. The clerk recognized that the book belonged to Wang Jiashun, and secretly reported it to the Huishan Police. Detective Liu Baoshan was dispatched to arrest Feng and bring the book to the police station. Under questioning, it was learned that his accomplice Xie Jinbao was waiting at the entrance of the Siming Bank, but he may have already taken a train to Wuxi. Chinese and Western detectives immediately took a car to the North Station, where they saw Xie</p>
<p>Buying Tickets. They arrested him and took him to the police station. At the same time, they immediately dispatched detectives, along with Feng Song, to take a train to Wuxi to arrest the murderer Wang Songfa and bring him to justice. Yesterday morning at 9:30, the police sent Xie Jinbao to the First Special District Court to Judge Gao Yi, who, according to the police lawyer Zhang Tianyin, stated that the police had just received a long-distance call from the detectives who had been dispatched to Wuxi to arrest the murderer Wang Songfa, stating that the murderer Wang Songfa had been arrested and would be brought to Shanghai at 11:00 this morning. Therefore, the two criminals Feng and Wang cannot be brought to trial today and must be interrogated tomorrow. But at the time, the police</p>
<p>If They Had Not Rushed to the North Station,</p>
<p>to Arrest Xie, then Xie might have rushed back to Wuxi to report to Wang, and Wang would have been unable to be arrested. Therefore, he requested that Xie be detained and interrogated together with Feng and Wang. Xie Jinbao confessed that he was 21 years old, a blacksmith in Wuxi, and had known Wang Songfa for many years. The day before yesterday, Wang asked me and Feng to come to Shanghai to withdraw the money he had deposited. When we arrived in Shanghai, Feng Song gave me two dollars and told me to keep watch at the entrance of the bank. If he</p>
<p>There Was Any Danger,</p>
<p>I should quickly return to Wuxi. Later, Feng was indeed arrested, and I rushed to the North Station to return to Wuxi and was arrested while buying tickets. But I did not know that Wang Songfa's deposit was obtained by murdering three people. I beg for your judgment. Judge Xiao Xiefen verified the confession and ordered that Xie Jinbao be temporarily detained.</p>
<h3>A Member of the Qichang Zhan Security Guard Kills a Robber</h3>
<p>Using a Boundary Stone to Break Down the Door</p>
<p>The Robbers Seize a Handgun</p>
<p>Three Victims Injured</p>
<p>The Dead Robber Resembles a Laborer</p>
<p>The home of a member of the security guard of the Qichang Ji Meiyuan residence in Pudong was suddenly robbed yesterday morning, and one robber was killed on the spot. There was no dereliction of duty. The details of the investigation are recorded below:</p>
<p>Shooting a Robber Dead: Lu Liuzhu, 26 years old, is currently a member of the third team of the Yangjing District Security Guard. He lives at No. 66 Meiyuan Residence. His family is well-off, attracting the covetousness of robbers. At 3:35 yesterday morning, while Mr. Lu was asleep, five robbers, speaking in the accents of Chongming and Jiangbei, climbed over the bamboo fence. They used a boundary stone (about three feet long and five inches square) with a blue cloth strip tied to it to break through the outer and inner doors. Two robbers stood guard outside, and two robbers, each wielding a five-inch-long dagger, broke into the bedroom. One robber first snatched two gold hairpins from Mr. Lu's wife, Jin. At this time, Mr. Lu was awakened and quickly grabbed his self-defense handgun from under his pillow. He jumped out of bed and shouted at the robbers not to move. However, the robbers dared to resist, attempting to seize Mr. Lu's handgun and stabbing at Mr. Lu's left and right hands. In pain, Mr. Lu pulled the trigger and fired four shots in succession, killing one robber on the spot. The remaining robbers, seeing the situation was unfavorable, fled.</p>
<p>Three People Injured: Lu's younger brother, Defu, and his father, Jin Quan, were sleeping in another room. When the robbers broke down the door, they got up and put on their clothes, which was seen by the robbers on guard. Defu's left wrist and back were stabbed in two places. Jin Quan, nearly sixty years old, was beaten with a wooden stick, resulting in a bruised back. Yesterday morning, they and Liu Fu took a rickshaw to Pudong Hospital for treatment. It is reported that the injuries of the three are not serious and are expected to fully recover in about two weeks.</p>
<p>The Appearance of the Dead Robber: It has been found that Meiyuan Residence is about six miles away from the third district and about half a mile away from the first police station of Qichang Zhan. Therefore, the police did not hear anything during the robbery. It was not until dawn that the victim sent someone to the district to report the incident. District Chief Zhang immediately went to inspect the scene and found the dead robber lying at the door, wearing a blue cloth short shirt and pants with a black jacket. His shoes had fallen off. He was about thirty years old and looked like a laborer. In his pocket was a red invitation card (reading "This month, the 23rd of the Gregorian calendar, the 15th of the lunar calendar, is my father's 80th birthday celebration. Li Shihou respectfully bows, place set at Zhuangyuan Restaurant, Pingliang Road, Yangshupu, No. 862 Yaohua Lane.") Next to the corpse were three hats, a dagger, and a candle. An order was issued to the local bailiff to report to the local court for an inspection. The dagger, candle, and red invitation card were taken back to the district for a detailed report to the General Bureau for review.</p>
<p>Court Inspection: After receiving the report, the court commissioned Prosecutor Shen Zhaoming and Clerk Yuan, accompanied by staff, to cross the Huangpu River at 3 p.m. to arrive on the scene. After questioning, no family members of the deceased were present to identify the body. The autopsy revealed a gunshot wound on the left chest of the deceased, with the bullet not having exited. It was determined that the deceased had died from a fatal gunshot wound sustained while alive. An order was issued to take photographs and place the body in a coffin, and the deceased's belongings were taken back to the warehouse for further investigation.</p>
<p>Suspect Detained: Because the name of the dead robber was unknown, District Chief Zhang immediately sent someone to notify Li Shihou at the address on the red invitation card to come to the district for questioning. Li firmly denied issuing the invitation card, and because his statements were ambiguous and suspicious, it was decided to temporarily detain him for further investigation and verification.</p>

<h3>Measures to Resolve the Issue of Sealed Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>Should Be Negotiated with the Anti-Japanese Association by Local Chambers of Commerce</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday replied to the Tongshan County Chamber of Commerce regarding the resolution of the issue of sealed Japanese goods, stating that local chambers of commerce should negotiate with the Anti-Japanese Association. The letter states: "Upon receiving your telegram of the current month, the 12th, we understand that sealed Japanese goods should be resolved quickly to avoid prolonged delays. Localities share the same sentiment. The Shanghai market is particularly affected. Our association has repeatedly urged the Anti-Japanese Association to discuss and announce a resolution as soon as possible based on the demands of various industries. However, due to the great importance of this matter, the association is still considering it carefully. As for how to dispose of the sealed Japanese goods in various localities as soon as possible, it should be handled through direct negotiation between local commercial organizations and the local Anti-Japanese Associations. Our association is limited by its authority and cannot overstep its bounds. We hope for your understanding."</p>
<h3>Postponement of the Japanese Textile Mill Conference</h3>
<p>To be Scheduled After Takesue Kaneso Arrives in Shanghai</p>
<p>According to a report in a previous newspaper, Japanese textile mills in Shanghai were scheduled to hold a joint representative conference today (the 15th) to discuss a resolution regarding Takesue Kaneso's telegram urging a temporary suspension of the factory shutdowns. Yesterday, a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency made a special trip to the Japanese Textile Mills Association in Shanghai to inquire about the above news and the important issues of the conference. According to someone from the association, since the 2nd of this month, the textile mill industry in this city, convened by the president of the Textile Industry Association, Imura, held a joint representative conference. All the representatives of the textile mills in Shanghai, due to excessive losses and inability to maintain operations, unanimously refused to accept the original plan to shorten the work hours by 20% and advocated a temporary complete shutdown to wait for an opportunity. However, factories with strong financial resources, if still willing to continue operations, would be allowed to do so at their convenience. Seeing the firm attitude of the representatives, Imura left Shanghai and returned to Japan on the day after the meeting (the 3rd) to report everything to Takesue Kaneso, the president of the Textile Mills Association in China, in Osaka. Unexpectedly, on the evening of the 11th, this association (as the Japanese refer to themselves) suddenly received an urgent telegram from Osaka from Takesue Kaneso, discouraging the representatives of the mills in this port from deciding to shut down the factories and stating that he had found a proper remedy and would implement his proposal after he arrived in Shanghai from Osaka. However, it is not known what method Takesue Kaneso's so-called proper remedy would employ. After receiving this telegram, this association had the motive to convene a joint conference of representatives of various textile mills in Shanghai. It was originally scheduled to be formally held tomorrow (the 15th), but now a temporary problem has arisen. This conference has to be postponed accordingly. As for when the meeting will be held, it will definitely have to wait until Takesue Kaneso arrives in Shanghai before a decision is made.</p>
<h3>Consolidated News of Donations for the Support of Ma Zhanshan</h3>
<p>The Hardware Industry Association Remits 2,500 Yuan: The Hardware Industry Association sent a telegram to Ma Zhanshan in Hailun, which read: "Chairman Ma of Hailun, your lone army's resistance against Japan is admired by all. Our industry has raised 2,500 yuan, which has been telegraphed to Harbin through Citibank in Shanghai. It is a small contribution to support the military needs. Please send someone to receive it and reply. Sincerely, the Shanghai Hardware Industry Association." Chairman Ma replied by telegram: "To the Shanghai Hardware Industry Association, your telegram has been received. Thank you for your support and generous donation. The officers and soldiers of the three armies share your heartfelt sentiments. Our government has now moved to Hailun. Your donation has been assigned to be transferred from Harbin. Also reported is Ma Zhanshan's gray, sealed message."</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Returning from the United States Remit Over 900 Yuan: On the 11th of this month, the President Wilson arrived in Shanghai from New York, USA. A third-class passenger on board claimed that when the ship passed through Japan, they had gone ashore with other passengers and crew members for sightseeing. They found groups of three to five Japanese people holding flags with slogans such as "Occupy the Three Northeastern Provinces" and "Down with the Chinese," joyfully dancing and demonstrating in lines. They were insulted at every turn. We were in the tiger's mouth and dared not resist, so we could only swallow our anger and return to the ship. After the ship departed from Japan, all the passengers were overseas Chinese who had lived in the United States for many years. Living in a civilized country, they had never witnessed such barbaric behavior. They mourned our country's declining politics and increasing foreign insults. Some cried bitterly, and some vowed to resist foreign aggression to the death. Then, crew members Xu Maofang, Ye Qinji, Yu Gui, Yan Zheng, Ye Yan, etc. continued to speak with grief and passion, roughly saying that our country has 3 million soldiers and hundreds of thousands of officers, but only General Ma Zhanshan can kill enemies and resist insults. Now, he has retreated to Hailun due to lack of ammunition and reinforcements. So they initiated a fundraising campaign to support Ma. The crew members took the lead, contributing 706 yuan and 6 jiao, and the passengers contributed 285 yuan and 5 jiao. When they arrived in Shanghai on the 11th, the crew members filled out a remittance form at the Bank of China to telegraph it to General Ma. The bank issued two receipts. The passengers were all third-class passengers, and the crew members were also all third-class crew members. If they could have solicited donations from first and second class, the results would certainly have been more than this, it was said.</p>
<p>The Huasheng Company Employees Donate 130 Yuan: All the staff and workers of Huasheng Printing Company, No. 261 North Henan Road, realizing that General Ma Zhanshan is resisting the Japanese invaders with a lone army, and mindful of the difficulties of the army stationed on the frontier, donated 130 yuan. Yesterday, Wang Keqin, an employee of the company, delivered it to the Bank of China to be remitted to General Ma Zhanshan in Hailun as a token of respect.</p>
<p>Ma Zhanshan Thanks the Municipal Chamber of Commerce by Telegram: The Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously remitted 10,000 yuan to General Ma Zhanshan as a reward. According to a telegram from General Ma Zhanshan in Hailun: "To the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Wang Xiaolai and gentlemen, your letter has been received. Your donation of 10,000 yuan has been received and acknowledged in the reply telegram on the 28th. Thank you for your support." - Ma Zhanshan, gray seal.</p>
<p>Ma Zhanshan Thanks the Chaozhou Association by Telegram: "To the Chaozhou Association in Shanghai, your telegram has been received. Your generous gift is deeply appreciated. I and my troops express our gratitude. Your donation has been dispatched to be transferred from Harbin." - Ma Zhanshan, gray seal.</p>
<h3>Jiangbei Disaster Victims in Severe Cold</h3>
<p>Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Relief Association Xinghua Disaster Relief Report</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Relief Association is the only relief organization in the country. Throughout history, it has been committed to providing disaster relief for major floods and droughts, feeding the hungry and rescuing the drowning. Its contributions to this year's flood disaster are particularly significant. In all heavily affected areas, the association has established branches to actively carry out relief work. Now, the Xinghua branch of the association reports that the floodwaters have not yet receded, indicating the severity of this flood disaster, which is rare in modern times. In addition to providing emergency relief, it is now continuing to provide winter relief. It was first decided by the association to allocate 50,000 yuan, but due to the severity of the disaster, it was insufficient, so another 50,000 yuan was allocated, totaling 100,000 yuan. Xinghua is divided into six districts. The association, together with the government's disaster relief representatives and local charities in the Jiangsu Relief Association, negotiated to divide up the areas in order to achieve full coverage. The association is responsible for the second district and six villages attached to the first district. Its recent work report is excerpted as follows: (1) The allocated 50,000 yuan for winter relief is not enough. (According to the investigator's report, there were originally 23,036 households in the 17 towns and villages in the second district and six villages attached to the first district. Excluding the current number of displaced households, after strict review, there are at least 10,000 disaster-stricken households. According to the investigator's experience, each household has about five members, including adults and children, meaning there are about 50,000 people. If two small children are counted as one adult, each household has three adults, meaning there are actually more than 30,000 people. It is decided to investigate once and distribute three times, giving two portions of wheat flour and one portion of rice. In the first month, each person will receive half a bag of wheat flour. In the second month, each person will receive 1.2 dou of rice. In the third month, each person will receive half a bag of wheat flour. A total of 3,600 dan of rice is needed, at a price of 12 yuan per dan, totaling 43,200 yuan. A total of 30,000 bags of wheat flour are needed, at a price of 2 yuan per bag, totaling 60,000 yuan. The sum of these two is at least 100,000 yuan. The association has approved an additional allocation of 50,000 yuan as mentioned above.) (2) Recent surveys are more detailed, but there have been no changes, and there is no assistance from other organizations or individuals. (3) The association has identified the names of the towns, villages, and hamlets in the second district and six villages, and the number of original households. The list is attached for your reference. (4) It is best to purchase wheat flour from nearby Taixian County, as previously reported. Rice should also be purchased from neighboring counties. The current price is 12 yuan per dan, but it should be prepared early, as it may increase later. (4) Regarding the work steps, it is instructed to provide more assistance to the elderly, weak, men, and women, and to find ways for the young and strong to work, which is the correct way to do things and is highly admired. We will implement it conscientiously. However, the fields in the county are still under water, from three to four feet in shallow areas to six to seven feet in deep areas. There is no work to be done urgently. This plan will be implemented when the opportunity arises. For this winter relief, it is planned to be carried out for three months, with one distribution per month. After the investigation and issuance of tickets, the first distribution will be made according to the number of tickets. Before the second and third distributions, there will be a supplementary investigation of displaced people returning home and extremely poor disaster victims whose food has run out, and relief tickets will be issued and distributed together. Among the three distributions, one will be rice, which will cost more because the disaster victims have not had rice for a long time, so it is used to adjust their diet. Recently, 100 boxes of sweet potatoes have been issued. Once the association receives them, they will be distributed to replace wheat flour. The distribution of clothes has already been entrusted to the investigators, who will discreetly mark the number of items to be given to men, women, adults, and children on the tickets so that they can be distributed together during the distribution."</p>
<p>The report also stated: "The disaster victims of this flood, in addition to food and clothing, also rely on relief materials to build shelters. According to the association's investigation, there are many villages that used to have one or two hundred households, but due to the impact of the flood, none of the houses in the entire village survived. Other collapsed walls and tilted houses are especially conspicuous. The disaster victims have been living in leaky boats or resting on broken dikes for months. Even if the floodwaters recede, they still have no home to return to. The wind and snow are pressing in, and they have no place to shelter. I am afraid that they will not escape death. The situation is especially tragic. The only relief organization in Xingyi planning for this is the county chamber of commerce, which has prepared tens of thousands of reed mats to help them build shelters when the water recedes, but it can only be given to the urban area, and it cannot do more. The association needs a lot of money and dare not make any claims, and other organizations have not made any preparations, so there is nothing to be done. I dare to offer my opinion, if the association is kind enough to pity them, in addition to giving food and clothing, it can raise funds to purchase large quantities of reed mats to help all the homeless disaster victims in the county." It is reported that the association has approved all the requests of the Xinghua branch. As for the construction of thatched huts, it has been replied that it will be allowed to withdraw funds for the event within the relief funds, so as to avoid the disaster victims being displaced.</p>
<h3>Zhu Qinglan Telegraphs the Tragic Situation in the Disaster Area</h3>
<p>Zhu Qinglan went to Wuhan to investigate the disaster. A telegram came from Wuhan on New Year's Day, stating that there was a strong wind in Hankou on the evening of the 11th, the weather suddenly turned cold, and it froze. On the morning of the 12th, he inspected the Heshan disaster fence. The area is divided into 17 reed fences, with 17,000 disaster-stricken households, totaling 106,076 people, mostly from Mianyang, Jichuan, Tianmen, and Qianjiang. Within a dozen miles, all that could be heard was the sound of hunger and cold. Within an hour, I personally saw several deaths. Then, I went to the Qiaokou disaster fence to inspect, with more than 10,000 disaster victims. The situation was the same. In total, more than 170,000 people have been taken in in the three towns of Wuhan. The number of those who have not been taken in is still unknown. It is said that the number of disaster victims under other names is far from the original need for wheat, cotton, and clothing. This morning, I took advantage of Cai's inspection of the porridge factory and distributed flour in Heshan. He went to Hunan in October to investigate the disaster.</p>
<h3>Jiangnan Seawall Aftermath Committee</h3>
<p>The seawalls in Baoshan, Taicang, Changshu, and Songjiang counties were impacted by storms, heavy rains, and giant tides in mid-August of this year, and the seawalls were in danger of collapse. Fortunately, the Jiangnan Seawall Engineering Office carried out emergency rescue operations in sections, ensuring safety and preventing unexpected disasters. People from Bintai Changsong County believe that the aftermath of the seawall is unthinkable and have repeatedly telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Government, the Department of Civil Affairs, and the Department of Finance, requesting the swift allocation of huge funds to rush the construction of the seawalls in each county as soon as possible to protect the lives of the people. However, due to the huge amount of funds required for the seawall construction, there has been no solution. It is now learned that the authorities have decided to organize a Seawall Aftermath Committee to deal with the aftermath of the seawall as soon as possible. The Jiangsu Provincial Government will allocate 3.5 million yuan as expenses. The candidates for the aftermath committee will be the Jiangsu Provincial Government Construction Department, the Shanghai Municipal Government Public Works Bureau, the Bintai Changsong County Government, the Construction Bureau Director, etc. as ex officio members, and local well-reputed and impartial gentry will be hired as members. The organization will be launched soon.</p>

<h3>Jiangxi Association Established</h3>
<p>The Jiangxi people in Shanghai had been preparing for the Jiangxi Association. Yesterday, the inaugural meeting was held at the Hu'an Guild Hall. One hundred and twenty people attended. The preparatory members first reported on the process. Mr. Li Liejun was elected as the temporary chairman, and he announced the meeting open. After customary ceremonies, Mr. Li reported, "Today, we continue to hold this meeting, and fellow villagers are participating with such enthusiasm, which shows that our hearts are united in saving our hometown and saving the country. The purpose of this association's organization is detailed in the charter, and it is a purely political party. In fact, we must focus on improving politics and promoting public opinion. Although this is the Jiangxi Association, we should also pay attention to the overall situation. If the central government's politics can be improved, the local areas will be easily reorganized. If the local areas can govern themselves, they can also assist the central government. This is what distinguishes this association from ordinary ones. Based on this spirit, we should have two insights: that is, we should have understanding and sincerity for past events, and we should have a spirit of common struggle for future events. This point, I think, will be approved by you all, and I hope you will all pay attention to it. Today's meeting focuses on the election. If you have no other opinions or proposals, we will start the election." Then, several election rules were discussed and voted on.

<h3>Retrial Verdict in the Case of the Qinglian Pavilion Owner Accused by His Concubine</h3>
<p>Original Verdict Upheld, Both Parties Innocent</p>
<p>Sun Yunqing, the owner of the Qinglian Pavilion market, was previously sued for assault by his concubine Jiang Cuiling in the First Special District Court. The initial trial found Sun Yunqing innocent. Sun countersued Jiang Cuiling for false accusation, and she was also found innocent at the same time. Both parties were dissatisfied with the verdict and appealed to the collegial panel of the Special Court. As a result, Sun was sentenced to a fine of 50 yuan, and Jiang was found innocent. After the verdict, Sun filed a third appeal to the Second Branch of the High Court. The High Court ruled to revoke the original verdict and send it back to the Special Court for retrial, as previously reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, the retrial verdict was announced. Sun Yunqing was absent due to illness, and his agent, lawyer Ni Zhengxue, was present in court to await the verdict. Zhou Hanting, the presiding judge, along with assessors Feng and Shen, took their seats in the First Criminal Court and announced the main text of the judgment: Both appeals are dismissed, and the original verdict of the first instance is upheld, both parties are innocent.</p>
<h3>Further Hearing of the Housheng Yarn Factory Lawsuit</h3>
<p>The directors of Housheng Ziji Yarn Factory, Bei Runsheng, Xue Gansheng (the eldest son of the late Xue Baorun), Fu Hongshui, Zhao Jixiang, Zhang Lanping, Cheng Houkun, and the manager Li Dixian, etc., were previously sued in a criminal case by the factory's employee representatives Jiang Zhonghe, Zhou Qichang, etc., who hired lawyers Tao Wuzhi and Wang Xiubo to file a complaint with the First Special District Court, accusing them of embezzlement of dividends, etc. At the last court hearing, Xue and Fu were absent. The court ordered the five people who were present, including Bei Runsheng, to each provide a guarantor who would ensure their presence at any time for questioning, as previously reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, the hearing continued. Because there were many cases, it was already after 5 o'clock when this case was opened. The defendant's agent, lawyer Wu Linkun, stated that the five defendants who were present at the last hearing were all present today, and Fu Hongshui had also rushed back from another place to turn himself in. However, Xue Gansheng was indeed suffering from a severe illness with swelling all over his body, so he was still unable to be present. If the court did not believe this, it could send a forensic doctor to Xue's home at No. 832 Avenue Joffre in the French Concession to investigate, etc. Fu Hongshui then stated that the two of them had been managers at Zhikangzhuang on Tianjin Road. Housheng Yarn Factory had a total of seven shareholders, and he was a shareholder and director with 50 shares. The chairman of the board was the late Xue Baorun. Now, the Housheng Factory has been closed due to losses and has been transferred to the Shenxin Yarn Factory. The presiding judge, Feng Shide, asked Fu whether the Housheng Factory had profits in 1926, 1927, and 1928. Fu answered that there were profits of over 100,000, but after deducting the depreciation fund of 50,000 each year, there was little profit left. He was asked whether the profits had been distributed. Fu answered that because there was only over 10,000 yuan, it was kept in the account. By the second half of 1929, there were losses and the factory was closed. The plaintiff Jiang Zhonghe was then questioned by Judge Feng about how much the Housheng Factory had actually earned in the three years. Jiang answered that, including the so-called reserve fund of 300,000 by the defendant, and according to the manager's report, it was over 900,000. In these three years, there were a total of over 500,000 earned. Because in 1926 and 1927, over 110,000 was earned, and in 1928, over 140,000 was earned, plus the reserve fund of 300,000, the total was 550,000. Moreover, the red accounts also clearly stated how much the net profit was, so depreciation, etc., had naturally already been deducted. Lawyer Wu then presented a flow account book, pointing out that the source of the 300,000 was not a dividend from profits. Therefore, to understand the situation of this case, it was necessary to have an accountant thoroughly investigate all the account books of Housheng. Finally, the plaintiff's lawyer stated that Xue Gansheng, one of the defendants, was the son of Xue Baorun. Now he claimed to be ill, but the truth was unknown. Because Xue Baorun was a major shareholder of the Housheng Factory, holding 55% of the factory's shares. Now that Xue had passed away, his eldest son, Xue Gansheng, was most familiar with the affairs of the factory and was a key figure in this case. He must be present. Please arrest him or order him to provide bail. Judge Feng reported this and, as it was already 7 o'clock, ordered that the case be adjourned pending the appointment of an accountant to audit the accounts, and that another hearing be scheduled. Fu Hongshui was ordered to provide a guarantor who would ensure his presence at any time. The remaining people were each ordered to provide their original guarantors. A forensic doctor was also sent to Xue Gansheng's home to investigate and verify the situation.</p>

<h3>Mr. Wang Yongkang Entrusts a Message to Mr. Liu Xintao</h3>
<p>(Discussing the Establishment of a Porcelain Company)</p>
<p>Mr. Xintao, after reading your article in Shenbao, "A Brief Description of Porcelain Making in Jingdezhen," I know that you are an enthusiastic advocate of national products and that you are very knowledgeable about the porcelain industry. Since we and our colleagues left school in 1925, we have witnessed the decline of domestic industry and frequent foreign insults. Therefore, we have united with our comrades to promote national products. Also, in view of the fact that Jingdezhen porcelain is a famous product of our country, we established the Jingdezhen Porcelain Company on Nanjing Road and sent Mr. Tan to Jingdezhen to investigate the porcelain industry, hoping to improve it in the future. However, in recent years, although we have worked hard, the only results we have obtained are being bullied and sabotaged by colleagues who stick to conventions. There has been no benefit to the porcelain industry itself. We feel ashamed when we examine ourselves at night. Now, after reading the newspaper, we all express sympathy for your enthusiasm. Therefore, we intend to make you a comrade. In the future, we hope that you will teach us about all the aspects of the porcelain industry that should be promoted and reformed. If you intend to launch a kiln company or a porcelain factory, we would be happy to sponsor it and do our best to promote national products. We would be very grateful if you could inform us of the organizational outline and plan.</p>
<h3>Mr. Chang's Message (Discussing Electrical Porcelain Industry with Mr. Liu)</h3>
<p>Having read Mr. Liu Xintao's description of porcelain-making in Jingdezhen published in this column on December 11, due to my shared interests, I dare to consult with Mr. Liu, though I am a humble man. In my opinion, porcelain-making is an important type of ceramic industry, which is on par with glass, enamel, and brick industries. Each of the western and eastern countries has numerous factories, and universities establish specialized studies of these industries which are as important as electronics, mechanics, civil engineering, etc., thus becoming extremely developed. On the other hand, looking back to China, despite being the first country to invent porcelain, the modern factories have remained lacking, and research and experiments are even rarer, which is a pity. Given such an environment, if one wishes to gather capital of tens of thousands or millions of yuan to establish a factory for manufacturing, I am afraid it is not easy to gain the trust of entrepreneurs. Even if we only gather tens of thousands of yuan to first conduct trial runs, we need entrepreneurs with far-sighted vision willing to sacrifice, in my opinion, it would be better to collect fund from 50,000 to 100,000 to manufacture electrical porcelain, and set up research and improvement for the daily necessities to prepare for future expansion. This is because electrical porcelain (referred to as "electrical porcelain") is easier to manufacture, and doesn’t require much research. Yizhong Company and Qixin Company in Tangshan are both engaged in this industry and have done so for several years. As for the larger scale factories, there are also plants established by foreigners in Shanghai, with more than ten years of history. All equipment and manufacturing methods are new. Because manufacturing daily necessities such as cups and saucers are roughly similar, they have also tried to manufacture these, and have seen good results. However, since there are no experienced workers as in Jingdezhen, and electrical porcelain is not their focus, they have not developed this. Only manufacturing electrical porcelain is guaranteed to be problem-free. This way of production, while doing research, will surely gain the support of all parties. As for the location of the factory, I agree with Mr. Liu's high opinion that Hukou is a great location. But in the first phase of experiments, it is still better to be in Shanghai. There are all kinds of conveniences, and when the trial results are in and a large-scale effort will be required, then factories can be established inland. Regarding the matter of talents, Mr. Liu's opinion of sending students to study abroad is also the most important step. It is best to establish a ceramic studies department in the national universities to train talents, so that there won't be a lack of talent in the future, and it is possible to see the revitalization of the porcelain industry. Regarding the porcelain industry, it includes daily necessities (such as cups, bowls, dishes, teapots, etc.), decorations, bathroom utensils, electrical and chemical products. In addition, the manufacture of floor tiles and wall tiles is similar. The amount of foreign goods imported into our country every year is countless, and electrical porcelain is almost entirely Japanese goods. This is because although the quality is inferior, the price is low. During the current time of resistance, it is a great opportunity for entrepreneurs to invest. I am willing to discuss this with my fellow countrymen.</p>

<h3>The Economic Recession in the Dutch East Indies by Qiu Bin Cun</h3>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>The Dutch East Indies, encompassing 734,000 square miles, is sixty times the size of the Netherlands itself. The importance of the Dutch relationship with its East Indies colony is akin to the vital connection of the British Empire to its Indian colony.</p>
<p>The production of the Dutch East Indies holds a significant position in the international market. Its main products include quinine, accounting for 90% of world production; kapok, 80%; pepper, 70%; rubber, 30%; tin and tea, both 20%; and cane sugar and coffee, both 10%.</p>
<p>Amidst the current global economic downturn, the economy of the Dutch East Indies is naturally experiencing a major blow. The prices of its main products have plummeted. For instance, the market price of rubber per picul (担) has fallen from 280 guilders to 18 guilders; the market price of cane sugar per picul has dropped from 18 guilders to 8 guilders; and the market price of pepper per picul has decreased from 180 guilders to 50 guilders. The prices of other products have also experienced significant reductions.</p>
<p>Affected by the global economic panic, the Dutch East Indies inevitably suffers from the chronic disease of commercial recession. This recession naturally leads to the following phenomena in society:</p>
<p>(1) Restriction of Production: A single example suffices to illustrate the rest. Take sugar, for instance. Because the Russians, with lower prices than the Java Sugar Trust, adopted a dumping policy, selling at a reduced price in British Malaya, British India, and elsewhere in Southeast Asia, the cane sugar of the Dutch East Indies had no choice but to be sold at a loss. Furthermore, due to Cuba's reduction in cane sugar planting, the Dutch government had to issue an order restricting this year's cane sugar production to 2.4 million tons, a decrease of 500,000 tons compared to last year's 2.9 million tons. It was also stipulated that in the next three years, 100,000 tons could be added each year, reaching 2.7 million tons by 1934, after which this would be the standard production amount.</p>
<p>(2) Merchant Bankruptcies: The Medan Dutch Chamber of Commerce held an officers' meeting to discuss commercial issues. During the meeting, the chairman of the Chamber expressed numerous observations on this year's commercial market, stating that the business slump has been worsening. In the past three quarters, the number of merchants declaring bankruptcy has exceeded 250. Moreover, this number will increase even more in the upcoming quarter, as the end of the year approaches. Therefore, it is estimated that bankruptcies in this semester will not be less than 400. In 1930, there were 175 bankruptcies; in 1929, there were 118; in 1928, there were 81; and in 1926, there were 52. From this, it is evident that the business of this island has been in a decline since 1926. Considering the entire Dutch East Indies, the number of bankruptcies this year is at least in the thousands.</p>
<p>(3) Unemployment: According to a secretary of the Dutch East Indies Commercial Union, speaking to a reporter of the Dutch East Indies newspaper, the union currently has 841 members, of whom 71 are unemployed, meaning one in every ten is unemployed. Previously, female stenographers and typists could easily find positions earning 250 guilders per month, but now, earning 150 guilders per month is considered fortunate.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to a report released by the Batavia labor exchange on September 17th, as of the end of June this year, the number of unemployed had reached 8,400, including 2,400 Europeans, 460 Chinese, and 5,500 indigenous people. The majority of these unemployed individuals seek secretarial positions, but the local demand is for technicians and those with other specialized knowledge. As for secretarial positions, government offices and shops have long been overstaffed. No wonder the number of unemployed is increasing daily. The majority of the unemployed are secondary and middle school graduates, not counting the uneducated workers.</p>
<p>(4) Sharp Decline in Trade: A large volume of import and export trade in a region indicates a thriving economy. Conversely, a small volume indicates economic decline. Currently, the foreign trade of the Dutch East Indies is simply in sharp decline. Let us examine the comparative table of imports and exports for the years 1928, 1929, and 1930:</p>
<p>Year      Imports      Exports      Total</p>
<p>1928      1030       1590       2620</p>
<p>1929      1166       1488       2654</p>
<p>1930       923       1233       2156</p>
<p>In these three years, exports decreased year by year. Imports only increased in 1929 compared to 1928, but an increase in imports is not a good sign. Moreover, imports decreased significantly again in 1930. Comparing 1930 with 1929, imports decreased by 243 million guilders, exports decreased by 255 million guilders, and the total trade volume decreased by 500 million guilders, which is undoubtedly a substantial amount.</p>
<p>Let us also look at the general situation of imports in Java in September of this year, as released by the Batavia Central Bureau of Statistics. It is reported that imports in September of this year totaled 99,870 tons, valued at 36,458,000 Dutch currency. In the same month last year, imports were 152,239 tons, valued at 50,594,000 Dutch currency. As for the statistics from January to September, this year's total was 1,304,846 tons, valued at 411.809 million Dutch currency, while the same period last year was 1,470,034 tons, valued at 526.376 million Dutch currency. From this, we can understand that the trade of the Dutch East Indies is declining month by month and year by year.</p>
<p>(5) Austerity Measures: Since the economic recession occurred this year, the Dutch East Indies government in Batavia has had to adopt austerity measures to cope with government expenses. The original decision was to approve a 10% salary reduction for all civil servants working in government agencies throughout the Dutch East Indies, starting from January 1st of next year. However, according to the Ministry of Finance's budget, due to the national treasury's deficit, the government suggested to the Dutch government that the date of the salary reduction be moved forward to November. The Governor-General has approved this, and the estimated amount of savings in expenditure for two months is 1.5 million guilders.</p>
<p>(6) Issuance of Public Bonds: In planning to remedy the shortfall in government expenses, the Dutch East Indies government in Batavia, in addition to actively implementing austerity measures of layoffs and salary reductions, has also initiated the issuance of public bonds to compensate. The reasons for and amount of the issuance of public bonds have been submitted to the Dutch East Indies National Council for approval and to the Dutch Colonial Minister for review. The amount of public bonds issued by the Dutch East Indies government is 200 million guilders. This amount exceeds previous issuances in the Dutch East Indies because the current government's income is insufficient to cover its expenses, amounting to a deficit of 53.6 million. Without this remedy, the deficit would further increase to ten to twenty million. Combined with previous debts, the total would be over 200 million guilders. The Dutch government does not consider the issuance of this large public bond to be excessive.</p>
<p>Based on the descriptions in the previous six sections, it can be seen that the economy of the Dutch East Indies is trapped in a dilemma.</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>Among those suffering the most from the economic recession in the Dutch East Indies, it is the local masses, not the Dutch East Indies government. The government is hypothetical, not real. Government finances are based on expenditure within income. If government expenses are insufficient, they can still be taken from the masses to make up for the shortfall. Of the total population of 51 million in the Dutch East Indies, indigenous people account for 49 million, Chinese account for 1.2 million, and Dutch people account for only 154,000. Our vast community of 1.2 million Chinese suffers particularly greatly under the economic recession in the Dutch East Indies. I will now provide a brief analysis:</p>
<p>(1) Chinese Merchant Bankruptcies: According to a Batavia dispatch, on September 25th, the Batavia High Court declared 15 Chinese businesses bankrupt. Assuming an average of 15 Chinese bankruptcies per month in Batavia alone, the annual total would be 180. Moreover, considering the Chinese businesses bankrupt in the provinces of West Java, Central Java, East Java, Sumatra, Borneo, Celebes, the Moluccas, and the Lesser Sunda Islands, the annual number of bankrupt businesses would be no less than several thousand.</p>
<p>(2) Repatriation: According to a Medan dispatch, when the ship "Kimma" of the Paketvaart line set sail from Haikou, it was found that 116 Chinese were being repatriated to their hometowns by the local government due to lack of residency rights. In addition, 60 Chinese workers were being repatriated from various plantations of the Deli Maatschappij due to layoffs, totaling 176 people. Assuming that there are at least three or four ships sailing from Medan and Batavia to China each month, and that each time hundreds of Chinese are repatriated or voluntarily return to their homeland due to lack of employment, the total number of Chinese repatriated or voluntarily returning to their homeland each year is at least tens of thousands.</p>
<p>(3) Forced Closures: According to a Singapore dispatch, the Riau Islands, under the rule of the Dutch East Indies government, are lush with forests and abundant in fuel. Consequently, Chinese charcoal merchants in Bengkalis have established hundreds of charcoal kilns on the Riau Islands. However, due to heavy taxation and high costs, coupled with poor business in recent times, businesses are unprofitable. The Dutch East Indies Forest Minister has invoked forest protection as a pretext to order all Chinese charcoal kilns on the islands to close by the end of June. After protests from the Chinese Consuls-General in Singapore and Batavia to the Dutch East Indies government, the Dutch side agreed to consider the situation and execute the closures in stages. Dutch East Indies forest officials and income tax officials have repeatedly met in Bengkalis to discuss the matter. Chinese charcoal merchants, facing the current business slump, have no choice but to voluntarily close their charcoal kilns. Therefore, 50 Chinese charcoal kilns in Riau, Lingga, and Singkep have complied with the order and closed down, incurring losses of at least one million yuan, according to industry insiders. Approximately 10,000 charcoal makers have been laid off, 90% of whom are Malays, with Chinese accounting for only 10%. After being laid off, the Malays mostly switched to fishing, while the Chinese workers had no choice but to return to China. It is reported that the remaining 50 Chinese charcoal kilns have also received notices from the Dutch East Indies government to be closed down separately between the end of this year and June of next year. The losses for the Chinese merchants and the loss of livelihoods for the Chinese and Malay workers will become even more severe.</p>
<p>Other businesses, such as tin mines, rubber plantations, and cane sugar farms owned by Chinese merchants, are also suffering from the same misfortune of being ordered to close, suspend tapping, and restrict production by the Dutch East Indies government. Chinese workers are even more at a loss as to how to find a way out.</p>
<p>(III)</p>
<p>The name "Nanyang Islands" has always been associated with the adjective "golden." From this phrase, we can realize that Nanyang fully embodies the color of gold. Indeed, in the past, Nanyang was filled with the charm of intoxicating people. Our overseas Chinese have also built magnificent palaces in the economy of Nanyang. Therefore, our overseas Chinese have always regarded Nanyang as an "earthly paradise." Nanyang has never understood what a recession is, except after the outbreak of the European War, when some goods could not be imported due to military influences, causing shortages, and some goods could not be exported, causing surpluses, slightly revealing the knot of a recession.</p>
<p>But now, as capitalism has fully developed to the final stage of the third period of financial capital, the economy of the world, especially the economy of industrially advanced nations, has experienced an unprecedented and major recession. The Dutch East Indies is also under the dense clouds of this recession. As a result, goods are restricted from production due to lack of outlets, shops are closed due to lack of business, people lack purchasing power due to loss of employment, tariffs decrease due to the decline in imports and exports, and the government implements austerity measures and issues public bonds to make ends meet due to the shortfall in government expenses. The hardships of the people's livelihood are endless, and our overseas Chinese are clamoring incessantly under these dark clouds. Finally, we can conclude that the golden age of our overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies and other places in Nanyang has passed.</p>
<h3>The Red River of Batavia by Bin Cun</h3>
<p>In Batavia (also called Jakarta or Batavia) in the Dutch East Indies, there is a river called the Red River. The reason why this river is named the Red River is because the overseas Chinese once sacrificed themselves under the iron heel of Dutch imperialism, "their blood flowing into channels," shedding countless amounts of fresh blood, dyeing the river red.</p>
<p>I once went to Batavia at the invitation of a Chinese newspaper there. Friends there told me that during the Qianlong era of the Qing Dynasty, the Dutch colonial government wanted to force our overseas Chinese in the East Indies to pay an exorbitant tax. The overseas Chinese in Batavia, unable to endure the exploitation by the Dutch, became inflamed with national consciousness and opposed it. The Dutch government then ordered troops to massacre the overseas Chinese. The local overseas Chinese gathered to resist, and as a result, tens of thousands of overseas Chinese were brutally killed. Red blood spewed into the sky, and this Red River became the most important page in the history of overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies. The Dutch troops had sharp weapons and the government as their backing, naturally taking advantage of their position. Our overseas Chinese, however, had no weapons for combat and no government to support them, naturally destined to fail and harbor hatred without redress.</p>
<p>The Dutch government, realizing that the massacre of the overseas Chinese was too brutal and extensive, became somewhat afraid of starting trouble. Therefore, it sent an envoy to the Qing court to apologize. According to common sense, the Qing court would surely raise a punitive expedition to argue with them. However, the Qing court's response was, "Overseas traitors are not subjects of the Great Qing. Killing them is of no consequence. The court never interferes." The Dutch, receiving such a response, became even more unbridled in their brutal methods of massacre and had no fear.</p>
<p>The overseas Chinese, completely defeated and hopeless, and with the enemy's flames becoming more intense, could not help but develop a terrifying desire for mutual destruction. Therefore, they cut off their fingers, changed their clothes, pretended to be indigenous people, and lived with them to avoid being hunted by the Dutch troops. Over time, they assimilated with the indigenous people and forgot that they were of the Chinese nation. They could not even know their own ancestral origin and surname. Occasionally, when someone asked them, they were at a loss for words. This situation, common in various parts of Java, is truly pitiable. The Dutch massacre of our overseas Chinese is painful, and the Qing court's abandonment of our overseas Chinese is hateful.</p>
<p>Now, the situation in China is different. Our national government under the Party is very concerned about the suffering of overseas Chinese and wants to find solutions. The overseas Chinese in Batavia should know how to unite in spirit and use the Red River formed by our blood to irrigate the blood flowers of the overseas Chinese there, so that Batavia will forever be a paradise for our overseas Chinese immigrants.</p>

<p>Book Review</p>
<h3>"History of Japanese Imperialist Aggression Against China" by Ai Xuan</h3>
<p>Written by Jiang Jianren</p>
<p>The lessons of history never deceive. "Do not forget the past, it is a guide for the future." We who are heartbroken by the aggression of the violent Japanese should recognize the historical development of Japan's aggressive policies and carefully and meticulously settle this old score. We must not believe that this Japanese aggression in the Northeast is the ambition of a few warlords, a sudden event. History tells us that this is an inevitable stage in the history of imperialist aggression. In fact, it has recently been fully proven how deliberately the Japanese have planned this incident. The pitiful people of our country have spent their years in a daze. On the day the incident occurred, the whole country was at a loss. "A nation that has forgotten the lessons of history will never have a chance to raise its head." How should we learn from this lesson of history? I am introducing a book to readers as the first step.</p>
<p>The structure of this book is very sound, with systematic and accurate statistics, but it is not a running account. It has faithful and detailed theories, but it does not fall into the empty talk of "accumulating nouns." It has neither very profound and boring academic discussions, nor is it a superficial work that gathers scattered words and compiles them into a chapter. This can be regarded as the only reason why this book is a suitable reading material for the general public. Below, please briefly describe its content and structure.</p>
<p>This book is divided into three parts. The first part describes "The Causes, Policies, Methods, and Periods of Japanese Aggression Against China." This can be said to be the theoretical basis of this book, telling readers why Japan occupies the most chapters in "The History of Imperialist Aggression Against China." The author's opinion is:</p>
<p>1. There are six reasons for Japan's aggression against China: (1) Japan's overpopulation in the past sixty years has forced it to open up territory and emigrate abroad, so it came to China, which is vast and sparsely populated. (2) Because Japan has too little arable land, and the production of rice cannot increase with the population, there is a fear of food shortages, so it invaded our country, which is rich in products. (3) In order to make profits and develop its industry, Japan wanted to take this densely populated and vast China as the only market for its goods. (4) It aims to seize China's raw materials such as coal, iron, soybeans, cotton, and wool. (5) Japan wants to actively invest its surplus capital in China in order to reap the greatest profits. Because of these reasons, Japan "cannot but, to some extent, exploit China's interests, harm Chinese society, and seize Chinese political power," and recently, it has even further annexed Chinese territory.</p>
<p>2. The author lists four policies of Japan's aggression against China: (1) The continental expansion policy, "the purpose of which is entirely to occupy Korea and Manchuria and build a continental empire." The current facts show that the author has unfortunately hit the mark. (2) The maritime expansion policy. (3) The hard-line policy towards China. (4) The soft policy towards China. "Imperialism is a butcher that kills without spilling blood." How can China's weak diplomacy be a match for these insidious methods? "Therefore, if we want China's liberation, we can only use the strength of the Chinese nation itself to exchange it with blood and flesh, and no longer stretch our necks to Geneva or Paris."</p>
<p>3. The methods of Japan's aggression against China: (1) Military oppression. (2) The establishment of politically unequal treaties. (3) Economic aggression. The South Manchuria Railway Company is the commander's platform for Japan's annexation of the Northeast this time. (4) Japan is also very fierce and powerful in cultural aggression, resulting in countless "Japanese obedient citizens" and not a few "Japanized Chinese." (To be continued)</p>
