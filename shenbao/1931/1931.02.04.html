<p>政黨之政戰。每不失敗於敵黨進攻之猛烈。而失敗於本黨内部之自生意見而起變化。苟我黨内團結一致。步伐嚴整。不予人以進攻之間隙。則敵黨雖甚勇敢。亦决不至於一敗塗地而不可收拾也。此非僅政黨之政戰爲然即凡小至一團體一公司之事業。大至國際間之交涉。疆塲上之戰爭亦無不以此卜勝負也。今以各國議會中黨爭之形勢言之。德日兩國之政府黨。均不免有此種弱點之微露。柏林電謂。國會將開始討論預算。政府難關重重。不僅受反對黨之攻擊。即本派各黨間。亦意見不能一致。政府爲欲避免均田黨之退出。故擬提出救濟農業計劃而社會民主黨則竭力反對此事至欲以倒閣爲抵制此即德政府黨内部不一致之徵也東京電謂。日政府與黨間發生齟齠因各種重要法案。違反一般人豫想。故民政黨非難政府之聲亦高。與黨幹部恐形勢惡化。開緊急幹事會。與安達内相協議結果雖未可料然形勢已甚緊張此即日政府黨内部不一致之徵也。德日兩國議會中之政爭。本爲常事。而政府與黨間之自生意見。則所罕見。大可爲政府前途慮耳。</p>

<p>十三、植物園</p>
<p>法國幾個有大學的城市差不多都有狠完備的植物園jardindesplantes規模當然比外省的更加宏大而且完備。</p>
<p>從巴黎大學出來。由聖哲克街走到塞萊河岸。轉彎沿着河岸向東走。十幾分鐘便到了植物園的西門。河岸的閒步已經狠使人神清氣爽了。但你走進植物園後。你的頭腦會更加輕快。在學生們住得最多的第五區。除我以前說過的盧森堡公園外。植物園可算得第二個比較適於學生們休息的地方了。</p>
<p>植物園地位没有盧森堡公園那樣大。風景也遠不及盧森堡公園那樣美。但這兒有一種普通公園所没有的好處。你在這兒散步可以增長許多見識。這園内有一萬一千多種植物。全都用科學的方法分門别類。每一種植物前面都插着牌子標明他的學名俗名以及産地等等。全世界各處種種不同的植物差不多都有一兩種樣本。你在這兒走過一圈。便等於把全世界的植物考察了一遍。</p>
<p>園内還附有動物園。不過要另外買票才能進去。裡面也有好幾種中國人不易見到的動物。但這動物園究竟是附帶性質。規模不大。巴黎城外另有一個完備的大動物園。以後當别爲文介紹。</p>
<p>蜂固善釀蜜者也。畫會而署蜂名。其勤於製作。可以想見。蜂社諸君子值庚午歲杪。風雪甚猛。爲消寒計。闢新世界飯店。集於一室。圍爐煑酒。殺粉調鉛。藝界之韵事盡矣。閱旬。檢其畫件。得精品二百軸。公開展覽。愚道出西藏路。因一過賞之。嘆爲觀止。張善孖畫虎。有虎虎撲人之勢。合以馬企周點綴樹石。工力悉敵。葉渭莘畫白鴿。由王師子補以薔薇。設色幽妍。風韵絶佳。商笙伯所畫「酒肉朋友。」花肉一條。黄壚一塜。别具風趣。孫雪泥之「柴米夫妻。」一飯籮。一束薪。亦頗神妙。奚燕子爲題一絶云。「聞道長安不易居。薪如玉桂米如珠。笑他貧賤夫妻輩。風雪漫天守故廬。」燕子年來飄泊。詩多牢騷語。烏衣舊夢。遂不自覺其慨嘆深矣。他若熊松泉之畫獅。馬孟容之紅鯉。沈劍知賀天健之山水。爭奇角勝。有足多者。至於「歲寒三友」一幅。鄭午昌畫松。錢瘦鐵畫梅。蒼烟撲秀。瘦骨多姿。益以孫雪泥之雙鈎新篁。緑深箐密。蕭然有風籟之聲。洵爲難得。予尤賞葉渭莘畫山水大横幅。氣魄高遠。水墨淋漓。杜詩所謂滿壁瀟湘者。不啻爲此詠也。論其神韵。在襄陽苦瓜之間。而不拘一格。化以筆法。故於蒼老之中。亦得清靈嫵媚之致。謝玉岑王個簃鄭午昌各繫一詩。稱賞備至。夫營營羣蜂。其刻畫之精。旣如上述。我東方文藝。儻亦有賴於諸君子之扶輪也歟。</p>
<p>▲梅訊昔范成大序梅譜。稱梅爲天下尤物。又謂梅以韻勝、以品高。故梅之品。以横斜疏秀。老幹杈枒者爲貴。如宋廣平杜少陵林和靖諸名賢。皆與訂方外交。良有以也。今有小觀園出品之梅。若順風梅。剪錦梅。古本劈梅。合景之松竹梅。牡丹山茶梅等盆景。各具姿勢。上市以來。購者紛至。如愛多亞路大世界西首門市部及望平街時事新報隔壁分銷處。均有應接不暇之概云。（六弓）</p>

<p>第十七回駐顔有術翠黛溷蛾眉續命無方黄金市駿骨</p>
<p>阿森的幾輛亨斯美馬車。正收拾得非常的漂亮。車身旣油漆得纖塵不染。光可鑑人。車墊也都是用品藍緞子。鵝黄緞子。繡出了許多五彩花朶。韁繩用緑色絲帶。車上插了一根有一丈多長的軟籐鞭子。那鞭子上用藍白的綢子相間紮成。一節一節。又裝成了紅的紫的黄的緑的纓毛。臨風招展。在夕陽影裏。更覺的好看。車子旣已輕快。駕上一匹烏雲騅。四蹄翻風。和騰雲一般地快。那馬也和御者一般輕快敏健。到了三月裡游龍華看桃花。以及新年裏的五日頭兜圈子。出風頭。和春秋兩季的跑馬汛裏。這幾位時髦的堂子裏先生。都要搶着坐阿森的馬車。到了那幾天。阿森的風頭。也更加健了。那亨斯美馬車。旣輕且小。不能坐許多人的。至多只能容三人。最好是和馬車夫並肩而坐。讓那馬車夫拉繮。不然。前面並坐了女伴兩人。馬車夫從後面還有一個位子。可以從前面兩人的肩縫中。代爲拉繮。花元春是個好出風頭。而又生性好勝的人。伊又常常學着自已拉繮。由阿森親自敎授。漸漸地親密起來。所以人家搶不到的。伊先自搶到了。花元春得了兩個伊所喜歡的人。可是這兩個人不能碰頭。但是伊又不願意刮上了那一個。扔下了那一個。就像孟夫子所說的。魚。我所欲也。熊掌。亦我所欲也。這就靠堂子裏先生的一種手段。一個姑娘。做了兩户客人。倘然没有手段。弄的不好。便閙的爭風吃錯。房間裏器具搗毁。杯碟亂飛。自已左右做人難。迫的無路可走。甚而至於吞生鴉片烟自盡的。有手段的姑娘們。伊能兩面灌米湯。對於甲客是山誓海盟。只有他一人是最恩最愛的。對於乙客也是指天矢日。除了他以外是没有第二人的。「曾經滄海難爲水。除却巫山不是雲。」也是他們的一種秘訣。第一步。就是使甲客不知有乙客。乙客不知有甲客。做了個避面尹邢。實在是春光漏洩了。伊依舊可以彌縫過去。對於甲客。說是自已完全傾心於他。對於乙客。不過是敷衍他罷了。換一個方面。向乙客說。也是如此。到了被伊迷惑了時候。甲乙兩方。都會相信伊的話。凡是手段高妙的倡門中人。都能如此。花元春自然當時也是上海的一位名娼。所以伊的對於一對歡喜寃家。雖則分道揚鑣。却仍能並駕齊驅。</p>

<p>▲具普通敎育困難外有特殊困難</p>
<p>國立勞動大學校長王景岐博士、因有人探問情况者甚多、最近談話發表對於勞動敎育之意見、大略如下、</p>
<p>余到勞大方數週、一切狀態尚未研究十分清楚亦無從說起改良之點、若就余個人行爲則殊簡易、第按照上月十九日之誓言中一字一句認眞的去做而已、對總理遺像所說的係實在話、對學校亦當做實在事在各方勸余担任勞大之前時、即有少數友人亦勸余勿就、謂「辦敎育事業、爲最困難之事件、而辦勞動大學、則爲困難中之尤者、」故仍有主張余仍往海外或國内辦外交、不必辦敎育行政因余對此方面、很少把握與經驗、但是後徵求同意、余始終並無一語推辭、畏難而退、可是余今天亦覺得在普通敎育界辦事困難之外勞大方面具有兩特别難題、</p>
<p>其一、爲我國勞動敎育之特别見解、即所謂勞動敎育化敎育勞動化者、此爲國民黨統一中國後之主張實行者此種最高尚之理想、在將最高深之學問丨大學丨　輸於最下層之社會階級内在歐美先進國家據余所知亦方在理想範圍彼之　謂勞動敎育者可以歸納爲二種、</p>
<p>一即職業學校在敎社會以適用的、必要的技能予人以半工半讀之機會顧此種學問、當然趕不上其他大學學生之程度、</p>
<p>一即國家社會設法使貧苦子弟亦能在大學内去研究高深學問</p>
<p>我國理想中之勞動大學化、大學勞動化、較諸别國自爲更上一層使勞動者受大學敎育或使受大學敎育者同時作勞動、在普通大學制度外、再加做工試騐之期間、第一先問做工者有無趣味、時間上能力上能否分配合度</p>
<p>其二即爲勞大工廠問題、勞大工廠原爲模範工廠其初年年虧本中經若干年、不特無充分力量發展而且愈趨愈下、且其設備是否合於學生工作、亦是一問題凡由國家經營之工業無論何國、無論管理如何得法、俱不及商家所經營者、故國家工廠向來賠錢、尤其在中國、勞大工廠倘不用工人完全敎學生去做萬無此事、即一部分使學生做工其費原料、耗時間牽動工人進程異常不便、假定目前勞大工廠仍由學校經營又加入學生練習勢必賠本無欵賠本若工廠停閉則機器不易保存、若不停閉則學校方面、那有許多財源賠墊、又若不停閉、又使之流動、多做外間定貨、則製貨之流通資本何來此數點在勞大方面辦理工廠、本身萬逃不了之困難、余之特别提出者、並非害怕不向前去做第要在使社會人士知勞動大學癥結之所在、可以隨時以高明意見指示、余明知其難而仍願意去幹、亦並無奇異方法不過第一步即如何設法節省費用集中財力以事整理、並希望政府經費按月接濟、使余有節省之可能、勞大産生未久、即蒙多難、元氣迄未全復、惟望在校同學同仁、能通力合作、共策中國空前之勞動敎育、引人光明正大之路、遵守一月十九誓言則爲余一生幸事</p>

<h3 id="c179">雪鐵龍計劃中之新車敷售價特廉 <a href="#c179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>雪鐵龍汽車以搆造特優。品質可靠著名於世者。歷有年所。而其售價之廉。尤爲汽車界所絶無僅有。當一九二六年時。該公司特添設偉大製造廠於勃金厦之四羅城。採用最新科學方法製造大宗車輛。以應世界各處之需要。今則該廠組織益趨完善。出品彌臻精優。而其計劃中之新車。亦旦日新月異。進步無已焉。兹就所知略述如次。</p>
<p>該廠計劃中最重要之新車。厥爲全部售價僅共一百八十五鎊之四缸轎車。按新車之精優華美。試以目今盛行十三匹至三十六匹馬力四缸式雪鐵龍底盤之絶對可靠證之。即可想見。蓋其搆製正相似也。新車錫以佳名曰捷爾吞車身搆造精優絶倫。華美異常。而其寛敞舒適。且猶不可冀及。車凡四門。闢有六窗。車内設備舉凡汽車家所習用者。無不應有盡有。其有喜用八活動車頂。安全玻璃。保險槓。行李架者。則有喀拉蘭通式以應其需要焉。按具有此種附件之新車。售價亦僅二百十五鎊耳。若六座家庭式新車。則售價爲二百十鎊。</p>
<p>至於六汽缸者。計有勃金滇轎式新車。特價洋二百三十五鎊。其備有活動車頂等設備者。名之曰勃開來式。又七人座者。其售價則爲二百六十鎊云。</p>

<p>▲顔色運用安全有關</p>
<p>▲駕駛汽車應加注意</p>
<p>顔色之與汽車安全問題。驟視之風馬牛耳。似不相涉。然因顔色所俱之返光力甚强。故與汽車駛行之安全問題。却有莫大之關係在也。交通專家對於顔色之利用。自小孩以至貨車。各項事物。凡可以利用顔色者。無不廣爲採用。深知顔色之返射光線。雖在遠距離間。薄暮或斷黑之後。咸能顯明感觸。一若日間也。</p>
<p>美國汽車會安全股。近以研究所得佈之於世。略謂街道中之幼童、凡身穿淡色衣服者。在遠距離間。令人注意。較穿深色衣服者爲甚。因之小孩於非極端謹愼時。不得通行於大道通衢外。尤必令汽車駕駛者。得於遠距離間。因淡色衣服之光線返射。而早有警告也。</p>
<p>顔色於避免馬路上之肇禍。厥功亦甚偉太。其方法即用各種記號標幟。令人加以注意是也。至其原理則因有若干種顔色。俱有返射光線之特質。令人於各種記號。對像及標識等。一望即知。</p>
<p>顔色之返光愈强者。則在遠距離間之發現亦愈易。即在光亮暗弱之處。亦能引人注意。故道路安全股。對於此項研究。費力甚多。據顔色專家之意。白色之返射光力在各種顔色中爲最强。奶油色次之。其後依次而下。則爲象牙色。皮革鈍黄色。淡緑色。黄色。灰色。淡藍色。淡紅色。深褐色。深紅色。及深緑色等是。</p>
<p>由上觀之。知白色乃馬路上最佳之顔色。若與黑色並用。不論爲字體或底面。其返射之光力。因相對而更烈。職是之故。黑白兩色常相互用。作爲記號及標識之用焉其他顔色之採用。有時其返射光力迴乎尋常。蓋因用不調和之顔色。相合一起。常能引起注意。超過黑白兩者也。美國機械工程會之馬路標記委員組。曾</p>

<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>經考察全國之摩托運輸狀况。而定一致之馬路運輸標議。其所舉慣用之顔色配合例如次。鐵路交叉通過處。白底黑字。鐵路交叉通行入口。黄底黑字。停止進行。黄底紅字。慢行。黄底黑字。注意。黑字黄底。曲折單程。白箭底黑字。問訊白底黑字。不准停車。白底紅字。有限數停車。白底緑字。限止行人。白底藍字。其他限止。白底黑字。</p>
<p>凡用黑色白色以外之顔色。相合一處者。在汽車駕駛人或行人之胸中。以爲必有特别之警告令其注意也。照心理學而論。凡於常例之外。而分擾駕駛人者。殊屬不妥。不過上列之各種顔色。不論底字。均富於返射光線者也。白字黑底。或黑字白底。究以何者爲佳。此問題當就夜間是否須用燈光照耀而决定之。苟須用燈光照射。則以黑底白字爲妙。總之黑底善於吸收光亮。而使白字愈加明顯著目也。</p>
<p>故從汽車駕駛人之安全方面言。白色實爲重要之顔色。故凡地面標識。籬笆。柱子。樹幹等。大多髹以白色。即在雨日霧天。亦能有强射之返光也。栅籬之漆以白色者。在灣轉之處。亦能減少危險。馬路上之白色標識。爲功亦巨。馬路上最普通之標識爲中分線、常用白色作記。昔日馬路工程師。不知白色具有强力之返光時。則用黑綫作界也。</p>
<p>美國機械工程會。對於作標識之材料。亦均規定。凡木材金屬料等。莫不詳細規定。油漆之種類亦有一定標準。金屬製之記號標識。須用琺瑯質之油質。以資耐久。木材之記號。油漆成分。必須不易變化褪色者。其表面又須光滑耐用而無罅裂。木料標記之製作。塗漆時須抹三次。俾免走色。每次塗抹時又須待其乾燥然後更塗。凡栅笆柱子等。若用此法塗抹。而油漆係屬上等質料者。其壽命可延三年之久。</p>
<p>駕駛貨車者。常用一種木製之假手。左右轉灣時。用示後來之車。此種木手常作白色俾便視看。白色之返光射力又有其他便利之處。爲各個汽車駕駛者所利用。譬如夜中驅車進車間時。感覺黑暗不便者。可預先於狹道上劃白綫兩條。俾車輪進行時有所遵循。而於車間之内劃一白綫作爲停止之記號則安全萬分矣。</p>

<p>在普羅文學的漸次没落民族文藝的更形深入的交替的過渡時期、産生了許多民族主義的文藝刋物、在這許多刋物中、「草野週刋」是比較有力而且是最前綫的、它的編幅雖然狹小、然而它的内容却是異常地精彩和豐富、現在已經出版到第四卷了、在藝術上、顯然地、每期都有着偉大的進展、</p>
<p>最近出版的第四卷第四·五·六號三期、内容除了記者的三篇「編後隨筆」和王鐵華的「期待着你」黄奐若的「慰安」兩篇續稿外、所刋載着的作品、有宓羅的「元旦的祝福、「爐邊琅語」、「都市散絃」、王墳的「生前死後」、郭蘭馨的「峭絶」、湯增毅的「我燃燒着火塊似的心情」、「鼓勵曲」、「妮娜絲姑娘」、野渡的「我在樓廊上憑眺」慧香的「鵲巢鳩佔」、王啓懷的「梁定遠」、鄒枋的「三對愛人兒」、以及「文壇新訊」等篇、都是很難得的作品、</p>
<p>王墳的「生前死後」、它的梗概、是叙述一個呌做陳大伯的農夫的兒子、自從三四年前這兒子分明給什麽軍隊拉去當兵後、他就詛咒當兵及打仗、後來他的兒子突然還鄉、但是不久又因吐血死去了、這自然是打傷的、陳大伯兒子的死、使鎭上的人都很深刻地覺到當兵的危險可怕、然而他反是從兒子的遺言中得到一種啓示、他想丨丨</p>
<p>「兒子的打仗是革命、革命是光榮的、兒子的死也是光榮了、一個人那裏免得了死、與其在床上生病、奄奄而死、還不若在革命中吃一彈、或者像兒子一樣、傷了吐血而死、兒子死的時候、不是並不怨恨嗎、他也許並不苦痛、他自已說當兵是百姓當盡的事、爲全民族而革命、爲革命而打仗是好的事情、他雖然死但是很快樂、因爲他自已說是已經盡了百姓的本分了、那麽我何必自尋煩惱而悲傷呢、」於是陳大伯不像往昔的痛恨戰爭而且又爲怕當兵的許多青年人解釋、並勸他們去參加革命、他死後、送喪的已經有好幾個穿着軍裝的鎭人了、</p>
<p>自利自私是中國民族一般的特性、尤其是智識淺薄的農民、他們對於當兵都存着死的恐怖的心、對於全民衆的幸福他們是毫不顧到而只恐惶着小我的犧牲、在另一方面、他們又自利地覺得當兵是很容易　　　　的、「生前死後」、作者便是抓着這思想　錯誤而給他們一個重大的痛擊、這樣、我們可以知道、作者所表現於作品中的事件不但具着民族主義的中心意識、而且給予人們一個偉大的啓示、在技巧上、作者更有一種强力、這强力、就是能夠洪大地激動我們的心潮、光是這「力的感動」、已可以證實作者的成功了、</p>
<p>王啓懷的「梁定遠」也是一篇很好的創作、作者描寫很十分深刻而動人、故事是述一個向上的青年見着這目前的時局、「···外有帝國主義的張牙舞爪、洶洶欲試、内有軍閥武人的跋扈、到處殺戮搶掠、於是天災人禍時至頻來、閙得全國人民號聲震天、餓莩遍野···」便感覺到「···生在這時代狂瀾下的我們、應當具有向上奮鬥、的精神、我不入地獄、誰下地獄、我不負這個責任誰來負去···」於是他就立志去效班定遠投筆從戎的故事、離開了那個大學而考入了軍官學校、要爲全中華民族的生存振興、在危困的環境中而挣扎奮鬥了、</p>
<p>我們看了這篇小說的大概、便可知道我們的作者是怎樣清楚地認識當前的時代、民族地位的日益淪落、因此、作者便喚起我們、生存於今日的苦雖時代的青年、是不應當躲在時代的幕後而要必然地追上時代的浪頭、作者更進一步地指示我們應負的使命、「···我們是青年、我們要起而自救、不要悲觀···」「把民族意識喚起、同心毅力、一致爲中華民族奮鬥···」在最後、作者更這樣雄壯地說、「···父親、讓你現在的兒子定遠肩一肩這個責任吧···」、</p>
<p>這的確是一篇民族主義文藝的力作至於時的方面、在「草野周刋」三期裏的詩要推湯增敭的最佳了、作者是個詩人、而且是個有偉大的天才的詩人、他更有着洪洪的火一般的情緒、如丨</p>
<p>············</p>
<p>我擎起一口寳劍、</p>
<p>以殺你、你這强暴的、</p>
<p>我揮着一把鋼刀、</p>
<p>以殺你、你這陰險的、</p>

<p>斬去那中華的障碍、</p>
<p>開闢了荒蕪的崖山、</p>
<p>············</p>
<p>丨鼓勵曲</p>
<p>這些詩、都充滿着熱烈和雄壯、作者是何等有勁的鼓勵我們爲中華民族奮鬥、這些詩都是含着偉大的意義而應重視的、話似乎說得多了、就此結束吧、在這、裏所介紹的皆比較重要的作品、其餘的、各篇爲編幅所限、未能多述了、</p>

<p>Last Night Chairman Chiang Hosted a Banquet</p>
<p>Brief Discussion on Sino-Russian Negotiations</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Mo Teh-hui, the plenipotentiary representative for the Sino-Soviet Conference, arrived in Beijing at 10:10 AM on the 3rd, traveling from Tianjin via the Jinpu Railway. Besides Wang Jia-zhen, those accompanying him included Secretary Wu Ze-sheng, Wang Zhao-quan, Specialist Li Chen, and seven other staff members. Chairman Chiang sent Gao Ling-bai, a secretary from the National Government, to welcome them at the station and dispatched Shi Chun-sen, the head of the General Headquarters' Protocol Section, to handle all arrangements. From the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, those welcoming them at the station included Hu Shi-ze, Director of the Asian Affairs Department; Ji Jing, Director of the International Affairs Department; Jiang Hua-ben, Assistant Director of the Asian Affairs Department, and over twenty other staff members. Mr. Mo's carriage was a chartered carriage number 246. After arriving at the station, Gao Ling-bai, Hu Shi-ze, and others boarded the carriage to meet him. After shaking hands and exchanging pleasantries, Representative Mo disembarked and walked out onto the platform, taking a small fire-powered ferry prepared by the General Headquarters to cross the river to the naval wharf, where they disembarked. They then traveled by car to the Central Hotel to rest, planning to meet Chairman Chiang in the afternoon to report on everything. Chiang also arranged to host a banquet at the General Headquarters at 7 PM for Mr. Mo and his staff. According to Mr. Mo, he came to Beijing in January of last year. The government suddenly entrusted him with the important task of plenipotentiary representative for the Sino-Soviet Conference. He declined but was not permitted to, so he followed the strategies given by the government and the opinions expressed by various sectors, left Beijing, and returned to Harbin to handle all preparations. On May 1st, he left the country for the Soviet Union, conducting negotiations based on the spirit of equality and reciprocity. More than eight months passed. Although there were only two formal meetings, there were dozens of informal negotiations. Initially, the scope of the meetings and various issues were discussed for four months, and the first formal meeting was held on October 11th. However, the Soviet Union raised the issue of the Khabarovsk Protocol, which hindered the progress of the meeting. After continuing to exchange views and through several twists and turns, the second formal meeting was held on December 4th, and three committees were established for trade, diplomatic relations, and the Eastern Route, with specialists appointed to carry out practical work. Since the meeting had entered a regular phase, Mr. Mo urgently needed to return to China to report the detailed progress to the government and to consult on all matters. He arrived in Harbin on December 29th. Mr. Mo suffered from insomnia during his months in the Soviet Union and also caught rheumatism. After arriving in Harbin, he sought medical treatment and also sorted out and resolved important issues such as the joint use of Chinese and Russian languages on the Chinese Eastern Railway and the equal employment of personnel. Therefore, he stayed in Harbin for more than ten days. The progress of these eight months of negotiations and the general situation of the correspondence back and forth have been disclosed from time to time, which I hope you are all aware of. As for the details, I will arrange a time to exchange opinions with you as much as possible after reporting to the government. (3rd)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Mo Teh-hui took the Jing-Liao train via Xuzhou to Beijing on the evening of the 2nd. (2nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After Mo Teh-hui arrived in Beijing, Liu Shang-qing was the first to visit him and arranged for lunch together. In the afternoon, Mo visited Hu Han-min, Wang Chong-hui, Yu You-ren, Liu Shang-qing, Zhang Wo-hua, and others to discuss everything. At 7 PM, Chiang hosted a banquet at the General Headquarters for Mo and his staff, accompanied by Chen Ji-tang, Chen Diao-yuan, Liu Shang-qing, Wang Jia-zhen, Li Jin-lun, Gao Ling-bai, and others. During the banquet, Mo briefly reported on the Sino-Soviet Conference, with the detailed progress to be presented to Chiang in person on the 4th. In addition to verbally reporting on the progress of the Sino-Soviet Conference to Chiang, Mo also plans to submit a written report to the Central Government. The report describes the situation and progress of the Sino-Soviet Conference in great detail. Due to the confidential nature of the diplomatic relations, its publication will be delayed. Mo will attend the Central Political Council on the 4th to report on the progress of the Sino-Russian Conference. Mo continued to tell reporters that he plans to stay for two weeks to ask the Central Government for instructions on the principles of trade and diplomatic relations and to report on the progress of the conference. Regarding the Khabarovsk Protocol issue, after several negotiations, Russia has stopped mentioning it. On the issue of redeeming the Chinese Eastern Railway with a reserve price, Russia has expressed agreement in principle, but the details need to be discussed. As for preventing Soviet Russian propaganda and communism, Russia has consistently denied having such actions. When I passed through Liaoning, Zhang Xueliang happened to be returning to Liaoning. I met with him to report only on the past progress. Zhang did not participate in any opinions, because Zhang listens to the central government's orders on foreign policy, and he also mainly obeys the central government's intentions on Russian affairs. Therefore, the future direction of negotiations still needs to be decided by the central government. (3rd Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) According to Wang Zhaoquan, secretary of the Chinese Eastern Railway Council, who came to Beijing with Mo Dehui, the results of Mo's negotiations in Harbin regarding the reorganization of the Chinese Eastern Railway: (1) Absolute equality in employment: after greatly reducing the number of employees, the railway still has about 3,000 staff members, with Chinese and Russian employees accounting for half each. In the future, if there are vacancies, they will be filled alternately by the Chinese and Russian sides; (2) The materials used by the railway are not exclusively purchased from Russia. There are plans to expand the railway's forestry and mining industries. The output of Chinese territory is rich and can be purchased as much as possible; (3) Implementing a reduction in freight rates: currently, because the railway's freight rates are high, many goods are transported via the Siping-Taonan Railway, resulting in sluggish business. It has been decided to reduce passenger fares by 15% to 20% and freight rates by 15% to 40%. There are plans to continue to reduce them in the future. (3rd Special Dispatch)</p>

After the detailed review meeting is passed, it will be submitted to the Privy Council's general meeting next week for approval. If there are no questions, it can be signed next week.

<p>Zhao Chengshou's Troops Plan to Reduce and Retain Four Brigades</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) Each army commander and Xu Yongchang discussed the matter at Wang Jingguo's residence on the morning of the 1st. Each army commander felt that there was not much violation of the principle of separating military and civilian affairs in Shanxi from the actual standpoint of the Shanxi army. Xu Yongchang said that although we agree, it will be difficult to approve in the Northeast. The three guard and reserve commands planned to be established by the headquarters are tentatively: Rong Honglu will be in Taiyuan, Zhao Chengshou will be in northern Shanxi, and Zhang Huizhao or Li Fuying will be in southern Shanxi. There are also reports that the Shanxi organization will have eight formal divisions and one road guard division, each division retaining four regiments for a total of thirty-six regiments, which is difficult to understand. In short, these are all proposals and must be decided by the Northeast in the end. (2nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) Zhao Chengshou's cavalry, consisting of the four divisions of Sun Changsheng, Lu Jiliang, Peng Yubin, and Guo Fengshan, are stationed in Datong and Suiyuan.

<h3 id="e20">The Governments and Parties of Germany and Japan <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>The political warfare of political parties often fails not due to the fierce attacks of the opposing party, but due to the changes arising from the self-generated opinions within its own party. If our party is united, moves in step, and does not give others a gap to attack, then even if the opposing party is very brave, it will never be completely defeated and irrecoverable. This is not only true for the political warfare of political parties, but also for everything from the small affairs of a group or company to the great negotiations between countries and the wars on the battlefield. Victory or defeat can be predicted by this. Now, taking the form of party strife in the parliaments of various countries, the government parties of Germany and Japan inevitably have the slight exposure of this weakness. A Berlin dispatch said that the parliament will begin discussing the budget, and the government is facing many difficulties. It is not only being attacked by the opposition party, but also the various parties within its own faction cannot agree. In order to avoid the withdrawal of the Land Reform Party, the government plans to propose a plan to aid agriculture, but the Social Democratic Party is doing its best to oppose this, even to the point of using a vote of no confidence to resist. This is a sign of inconsistency within the German government party. A Tokyo dispatch said that friction has occurred between the Japanese government and the party because various important bills violate the expectations of the general public, so the voice of the Minseito Party criticizing the government is also high. The party leaders are afraid that the situation will worsen and held an emergency meeting with Minister of the Interior Adachi. Although the outcome is still unpredictable, the situation is very tense. This is a sign of inconsistency within the Japanese government party. Political strife in the parliaments of Germany and Japan is a common occurrence, but self-generated opinions between the government and the party are rare, which is a major cause for concern about the future of the government.</p>

<p>The North Island of New South Wales Suffers Extensive Damage</p>
<p>Half of Napier Reduced to Ruins</p>
<p>Reuters, Sydney, 3rd: The observatory detected a severe earthquake at 8:51 AM this morning, which lasted for two hours. According to wireless reports from ships, the North Island of New South Wales suffered extensive damage, especially Napier.</p>
<p>Reuters, Wellington, 3rd: A very severe earthquake occurred in the Hawke's Bay region of New South Wales this morning. It is reported that the seabed near Napier has risen, so all ships are now sailing away. Many oil pools in Napier have caught fire, and communication is cut off, so news is scarce. Further telegrams say that the warship Veronica, stationed in Napier, sent a wireless report stating that no stone houses in Napier were undamaged, and many fires have broken out. It is feared that many people have been killed or injured. Several warships have dispatched sailors ashore to provide aid. Two warships are rushing from Auckland with doctors, nurses, and medicine to the disaster area in Napier. It is feared that there are already hundreds of homeless people. Another telegram from a gentleman in Napier says that the city's buildings, including the post office, have all collapsed as if they had been shelled. Another telegram states that the official field reports that 21 people have died in the earthquake in Hastings, 12 miles from Napier. Napier's hospital and nursing homes have collapsed, crushing several people to death. The fire in Napier is very fierce, and half the city is in ruins. Napier is still experiencing incessant earthquakes, and there have been reports of damaged houses and injuries elsewhere. The disaster victims of Napier are now taking refuge on British warships. Bridges on the North Island have suffered considerable damage.</p>
<p>Reuters, Wellington, 3rd: The death toll from the Napier earthquake will exceed 100. Bluff Hill, overlooking the entire harbor, has many houses built on it, and part of the mountainside has now collapsed. The commercial district, covering about half a square mile, has been completely destroyed by fire. Hastings, 12 miles from Napier, has also suffered severe damage, with several people burned to death.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Telena, 3rd: This area near Gletchai has again suffered a very severe earthquake, with countless houses collapsing and residents fleeing in all directions. The authorities have ordered troops and doctors to bring food and provide relief. The exact losses are still unknown.</p>

<p>Motion to Withdraw from the League of Nations Has Been Rejected</p>
<p>Parliament to Begin Discussing the Budget</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 2nd: The situation of the Brüning cabinet seems to have improved slightly today after the German Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee rejected the National Socialist Party's motion to withdraw from the League of Nations. This motion was only intended for party strife. The government party does not have many seats on the committee, and this result is seen as a good omen for the government's future. Parliament will begin discussing the budget tomorrow and is expected to complete it by Easter. The government faces many difficulties at this time, not only from attacks from the opposition parties but also from disagreements among the parties within its own faction. For example, to prevent the Agrarian League from withdrawing, the government proposed a 600 million mark agricultural relief plan, but the Social Democratic Party strongly opposed it, saying that they would vote against the bill in parliament to topple the cabinet. However, Republican newspapers supporting the government say that the premier and cabinet members are intelligent and courageous and have faced many dangers. Although this is the greatest difficulty in the ten months since they took office, they will be able to overcome it. The Deutsche Zeitung, an organ of the Catholic Party, also stated that if Parliament cannot cope with the crisis, the government will have no choice but to dissolve Parliament for the sake of the overall situation.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 2nd: The German Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee today discussed Foreign Minister Curtius's report on the last session of the League of Nations Administrative Council. During the discussion, the National Socialist Party moved to demand that Germany withdraw from the League of Nations because the League had completely failed in protecting minorities and in disarmament. The Communist Party also demanded withdrawal from the League of Nations, but both motions were rejected.</p>

<p>Second Stage Strategy of the Seiyukai</p>
<p>Telecommunications Agency, Tokyo, 3rd: Today was the last day of the House of Representatives Budget Committee, so the visitor seats were full from early morning, and the atmosphere in the rest rooms was tense. The meeting opened at 10:30 AM. Mr. Tsuyun Kunikazu (Seiyukai) took the podium and asked, "Regarding the press oppression incident at the end of last year, did Interior Minister Adachi apologize to the representatives of news agencies on behalf of the government?" Interior Minister Adachi replied, "I expressed my apologies in my capacity as the minister in charge. State ministers are always representing the government." Tsuyun then repeated this question to War Minister Ugaki, who also replied, "As the Interior Minister said." Mr. Tsuyun said, "In that case, suppressing freedom of speech and only apologizing for the ugly police politics is not enough. The Interior Minister's conscience has long been numbed." He also said, "The ban on publishing articles about the liquidation bank is actually intended to cover up the loopholes in the government's policy." Interior Minister Adachi replied, "The ban on publishing articles related to the liquidation bank is a necessary measure to prevent financial turmoil." Mr. Tsuyun then asked whether the Tokyo Stock Exchange's guarantee of 76 million yen from the Industrial Bank of Japan for its members was illegal. After several debates with Commerce and Industry Minister Tawara, he turned to Finance Minister Joue to question the recent inspection of the state of banks, reserving the rest of his questions and adjourned at noon.</p>
<p>Telecommunications Agency, Tokyo, 3rd: The House of Representatives Budget Committee resumed at 1:00 PM on the 2nd. Washino Yonetaro of the Kokumin Doshikai took the podium. After criticizing the government's attitude towards the labor union bill, he questioned Finance Minister Inoue, saying that the implementation of the relief law cannot be delayed for a day in the current state. Why is there no progress? Also, the government's plan to combine the steel industry has not been implemented and has become a deadlock. What is the reason for this? Finance Minister Inoue replied, "Both cases are under study and are expected to materialize soon. They have not become deadlocked." Washino asked, "Local banks have continued to collapse and suspend operations since last year. The government not only does not provide relief but also expresses its intention to prevent relief, which is incomprehensible." Finance Minister Inoue replied, "For banks that have suspended operations, after investigating their situation, we will do our best to have the Bank of Japan or the Industrial Bank of Japan provide relief." Washino asked, "The government should have decided on the first type of income tax and business income tax that was not decided in the fourth year, but now it is specially delayed and incorporated into the fifth year's revenue. Is it because you anticipate a defect in the fifth year's revenue and are using this as a cover?" Finance Minister Inoue replied, "It was compiled this way for the convenience of the affairs. It is not a remedy as Mr. Washino says. There are also items from this year that are included in the sixth year, but the amount is currently unclear." Next, Horikiri Zenbei of the Seiyukai took the podium and said that War Minister Ugaki had stated at the plenary session the previous day that unproductive military spending must be reduced. Would this cause problems with the army's responsibilities? War Minister Ugaki replied simply, "The reduction of unproductive military spending is a prerequisite for changing national defense facilities." Mr. Horikiri asked, "Can the military system reform not be carried out without observing the results of the disarmament conference?" War Minister Ugaki replied, "The progress of the disarmament conference will also be considered, but it is not necessary to wait for this to decide." Mr. Washino of the Kokumin Doshikai took the podium again and asked lengthy questions about military system reform, financial consolidation, and reducing the burden on the people. Next, Ota Masataka of the Seiyukai took the podium and said that Finance Minister Inoue insisted that the revenue estimate was not too high, but judging from the tariff revenue, it was 23 million yen less than the minister's estimate. He listed numbers and criticized Finance Minister Inoue's financial policy. Finance Minister Inoue signed, asking not to list individual examples, and asked to criticize the entire tax revenue. His words were extremely empty. Ota said that the total tax reduction, as the minister said, cannot be resolved by 60 million yen and should be more than 100 million yen. Is the expansion of the limit for issuing government bonds by the Ministry of Finance not a countermeasure? Next, Tsuyun Kunikazu of the Seiyuukai took the podium and questioned the borrowing of disaster relief funds from the earthquake in May of last year. Okuchi Kirou of the Seiyukai criticized the government's lack of sincerity in reducing government bonds and had a few questions and answers with Vice Minister of Finance Ogawa. Then, Sunada Shigemasa of the Seiyukai questioned the depletion of rural areas. Minister Inoue and Minister Machida only gave simple and abstract answers. Mr. Sunada was very angry, saying that the Minister of Inoue had no understanding or sympathy except for the merger with the textile industry. Finance Minister Inoue replied, "I cannot agree with the policy of giving money to farmers. We are now awakening from the prodigal policy." Sunada said, "If you resign, no matter who it is, even without a special plan, they can always do something to help the farmers." Then, after some debate on the public debt policy between San Shi Chungzo and Inoue Finance Minister, Chairman Takeuchi said that the Budget Committee will continue tomorrow. There was no objection from the audience, and they adjourned at 7 PM during Mr. Tsuyun's re-interrogation.</p>
<p>Telecommunications Agency, Tokyo, 3rd: The battle of the House of Representatives Budget Committee ended today, and the Seiyukai will enter the second stage of the strategy, attacking the government from the front. However, if the no-confidence motion is submitted too early, the remaining session will lose the material to impeach the government. Therefore, the timing of the no-confidence motion will be after the budget bill is returned to the House of Peers. However, regarding the method and order, it is necessary to submit individual no-confidence motions to both Prime Minister Delegate and Inoue Finance Minister before submitting the overall no-confidence motion to the cabinet. Therefore, it has now been decided to first submit the no-confidence motions for the two ministers, and then submit the overall no-confidence motion to the cabinet. In addition, the Seiyukai has gained three points in the battle of the Budget Committee, namely: 1. The prime minister delegate issue has exposed the government's weaknesses; 2. The loopholes in the government's financial policy have already been clarified; 3. The revenue estimates for the fifth year's implementation budget and the sixth year's budget are indeed too high, etc. The Seiyukai executive committee is discussing the attitude towards the budget bill. Some within the party advocate for the budget to be withdrawn, but the majority argues that it is more effective to implement the budget return theory than to advocate the withdrawal theory. As a result, this theory prevailed, and it was decided to move forward with the budget return theory.</p>

<p>The King Orders a Ban on Marriage</p>
<p>The Prince Resolves to Disregard Titles</p>
<p>National News Agency, Stockholm, 2nd: After Swedish Prince Lennart became engaged to Ms. Liselotte Sander, the daughter of a merchant, he announced it without first informing the King. Because a royal descendant was marrying a commoner, the King ordered the marriage to be banned. However, it is heard that the Prince has resolved to disregard his titles, leave the royal family, and marry Ms. Liselotte, after which they will live in seclusion on Mainau Island in Lake Constance, Switzerland. This is an unprecedented event in the Swedish royal family, so the Swedish people are paying close attention.</p>
<p>Reuters, Stockholm, 2nd: The Swedish royal family issued a notice today related to the royal descendant's love affair. Prince Lennart is engaged to Ms. Neswin, the daughter of an accountant in Stockholm.</p>
<p>The prince has announced this matter, but today the royal family announced that royal descendants may not marry without the King's consent. The King, after long consideration, has decided that he cannot agree to Lennart's marriage. It is heard that Prince Lennart is prepared to accept all the legal and constitutional consequences after the marriage, but the wedding date has now been postponed.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 2nd: The expert committee for the reorganization of the International League of Nations Secretariat met today to discuss whether the post of Deputy Secretary-General should be abolished or whether the number of staff should be increased. In fact, this is in response to Britain and France's dominance of the League of Nations. Currently, the Secretary-General is British and the Deputy Secretary-General is French, while people from Germany, Italy, Japan, and other countries only serve as secretaries. Therefore, these countries feel deeply dissatisfied.</p>

<p>Telecommunications Agency, Tokyo, 3rd: The Labor Union Bill, the Steel Industry Merger Bill, the Telephone Privatization Bill, the Enterprise Control Bill, and other important bills have all violated general expectations, and they may not even be submitted to the parliament. Even if they can be submitted, their essence will be lost. Therefore, voices criticizing the government are also high within the Minseito Party. Fearing that the situation will worsen, the party executives held an emergency executive meeting today and invited Interior Minister Adachi to attend the consultation. Therefore, there is a trend of discord between the government and the party on the issue of important bills.</p>

This opinion has attracted much attention because the US and the Soviet Union have not yet established formal diplomatic relations.

<h3 id="e64">### The Wuxi Chamber of Commerce Requests Correction of the Business Tax Rate in Jiangsu Province <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>In order to compensate for the loss after the abolition of likin, the Jiangsu Provincial Government has established a business tax, with the Department of Finance drafting regulations for the collection of business tax and detailed implementation rules, which have been approved by the provincial government meeting and will soon be implemented. The Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce believes that the tax rates set by Jiangsu Province, which are almost all between five per thousand and twenty per thousand, are significantly different from the general guidelines for the collection of business tax in various provinces set by the National Likin Abolition Conference in 1928. Therefore, it has specifically raised three points of opinion and telegraphed them to the Ministries of Finance and Industry today, requesting correction, and requesting that the Jiangsu Department of Finance be ordered to postpone the collection temporarily before receiving approval from the ministries. Simultaneously, telegrams were sent to the chambers of commerce in Zhenjiang, Nanjing, and Shanghai, as well as other places, requesting unified advocacy. The telegram to the Ministry of Finance is recorded below:</p>
<p>"We humbly acknowledge that your esteemed ministry replied to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce's telegram, stating that the report that Jiangsu Province's planned business tax rates had been increased tenfold from the original guidelines was a false rumor. Merchants and citizens were relieved and rejoiced. However, unexpectedly, news reports indicate that the Jiangsu Provincial Government's 367th meeting passed the business tax regulations and detailed implementation rules, as well as the tax rate schedule, with tax rates mostly between five per thousand and twenty per thousand. What your esteemed ministry suspected to be a false rumor has become a reality in Jiangsu Province, which is deeply alarming. After careful examination of the general guidelines for the collection of business tax in various provinces set by the National Likin Abolition Conference in July 1928, the business tax rates stipulated that the sales industry, manufacturing industry, printing industry, hotel industry, inn industry, entertainment venue industry, and photography industry should be taxed at one to two per thousand of their sales amount. The brokerage industry should be taxed at two per thousand of the brokerage fee. The contracting industry should be taxed at five ten-thousandths of the contract amount. The leasing industry should be taxed at one per thousand of the rental amount. The transportation industry should be taxed at one per thousand of the transportation amount. The money shop industry, pawnshop industry, and warehouse industry should be taxed at one per thousand of the capital amount. The general tax rate was one per thousand, and the highest was no more than two per thousand. The lowest, such as the contracting industry, was only five ten-thousandths. At that time, the Likin Abolition Conference accommodated the opinions of the business community, and the rates were carefully considered and determined. Although provinces could formulate their own flexible measures and tax standards in special circumstances, the tax rates levied should not be higher than the provisions of this general guideline. The intention was extremely prudent. Since the business tax is levied based on business income, regardless of profit or loss, the tax rate can only be expressed as a per thousand ratio and cannot be expressed as a percentage. However, if the per thousand ratio reaches ten, it is no different from a percentage. However, the Jiangsu tax rate schedule lists ninety industries, and the tax rates of fifty-seven industries exceed two per thousand, and forty-eight industries even reach ten per thousand or more. This not only deviates greatly from the general guidelines for business tax set by the Likin Abolition Conference in 1928, but also differs significantly from the fourth article of the general guidelines for the collection of business tax in various provinces recently submitted by your esteemed ministry to the Executive Yuan for promulgation, which stipulates that the business tax rate should be calculated using the per thousand method according to the tax base, and should not exceed two per thousand at most. This is the first point that your esteemed ministry should pay attention to and remedy. As for luxury and other businesses that should be banned, according to the fifth article of the business tax guidelines recently submitted by your esteemed ministry to the Executive Yuan for promulgation, provinces must establish a business tax review committee to collect business tax. It seems that the committee should be established before or with reference to the Likin Abolition Conference in 1928, representatives from chambers of commerce should be convened to participate in the evaluation. Currently, officials are not allowed to concurrently operate businesses. They may not fully understand the situation in the business community, and it is not advisable to interpret things literally, which may cause obstacles. This is the second point that your esteemed ministry should pay attention to and remedy. According to the first article, second item, of the business tax guidelines approved by the Likin Abolition Conference in 1928, business licenses should be renewed annually. The third article of the supplementary measures recently promulgated by your esteemed ministry also stipulates that businesses must apply for a business license within one month after the promulgation of the guidelines and supplementary measures, and in the last month of each subsequent year. The competent authority should determine the annual business tax rate, level, and amount when issuing the business license, and it should not be reduced or increased within that year. The collection period may be determined by each province according to the situation, monthly or quarterly, but the amount of tax should still be calculated annually according to the prescribed tax rate without any ambiguity, to prevent provinces from gradually re-levying taxes monthly or quarterly. This is the third point that your esteemed ministry should pay attention to and remedy. Furthermore, there is something that cannot be left unsaid: Since the government issued a clear order to abolish likin, merchants dare not be overly humble and forget the meaning of 'taking from the people for the people,' nor dare they falsely rely on organizations or engage in other hidden agendas. However, practically speaking, the increased customs duties have already been implemented, and the recently revised tariff has also been appropriately increased. According to the old Treaty of Renyin, the abolition of likin should be able to compensate. However, the original commodity likin has now been mostly converted into consumption tax, and the tax rate may be higher than before. The inconvenience of investigation and searching door-to-door has caused commercial unrest, which is worse than setting up checkpoints everywhere. The merchants' suffering has not been alleviated. The business tax that the provinces are now considering is a new burden for the merchants, who need to develop a habit of paying it. It is a new income for the government, which should pay attention to the source of tax. If the tax rate is too high, not only will the merchants be unable to bear it, but since January of this year, all prices have risen sharply, and the social situation is precarious. A slight increase in the burden will only affect the merchants, but the high prices will affect the entire society. This is what we are worried about. Our association cherishes the idea of sharing the joys and sorrows of the country and dares not suppress this information. Therefore, we urgently submit this report, hoping that you will carefully consider the intention of abolishing likin to save the people and quickly correct the Jiangsu Provincial Government's reported business tax regulations, detailed implementation rules, and tax rate schedule according to the general guidelines for business tax set by the Likin Abolition Conference in 1928, and order Jiangsu Province to temporarily postpone the collection before receiving approval from the ministry, in order to save the merchants from dire straits and ensure social stability. We await your orders with eager anticipation. Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce bows respectfully, Jiang. (The telegram to the Ministry of Industry is omitted as it is the same.)"</p>
<p>Today, the Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce also sent telegrams to the chambers of commerce in Nanjing and Shanghai, as well as the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce, requesting them to telegraph the Ministry of Finance to inquire about the discrepancies between the current general guidelines for the collection of business tax in various provinces promulgated by the ministry and the nine articles of the general guidelines resolved by the Likin Abolition Conference in July 1928, and to request an explanation. The telegram reads as follows: "Jiang sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance, and a separate letter will be sent. It has been found that the general guidelines for the collection of business tax in various provinces recently promulgated by the Ministry of Finance and the general guidelines for the collection of business tax in various provinces set by the National Likin Abolition Conference in July 1928, although both have nine articles, differ significantly in content. The most important difference is in the business tax rate. The general guidelines set by the Likin Abolition Conference in 1928 fully stipulated the types and levels in the second article, and they have already been determined separately. However, the recently promulgated guidelines by the ministry divide them into three articles, the second, third, and fourth. The second article stipulates that the types and levels should be determined separately by each province according to the local commercial situation. The fourth article adds a proviso that this does not apply to luxury businesses and other businesses that should be banned. Strictly speaking, businesses that should be banned should not be allowed by the state in the first place. What business tax is there to speak of? Furthermore, the eighth article of the supplementary measures stipulates that the tax base can be up to twenty per thousand of the capital amount. Business tax cannot be expressed as a percentage. Jiang has stated in detail in the telegram to the Ministry of Finance that if the per thousand ratio reaches ten, it is no different from a percentage, let alone exceeding it. How can merchants bear this? Furthermore, the industries that should be exempt from business tax were defined as the fourth article in the general guidelines set by the Likin Abolition Conference in 1928, which included four items: 1. Those with capital less than 500 yuan; 2. Those with annual business income less than 1,000 yuan; 3. Those without shops or signs; and 4. Firewood industry. However, the recently promulgated guidelines by the ministry only list one item in the second article of the supplementary measures, that is, those with capital less than 500 yuan. The rest have been deleted, resulting in the Jiangsu Department of Finance mistakenly listing the firewood industry in the same category as coal and collecting business tax, which is even more harsh. However, according to the Shanghai News on January 21, the Ministry of Finance sent a telegram to the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, distributing the general guidelines for the collection of business tax in various provinces, also stating that the general guidelines for the collection of business tax in various provinces resolved by the Ministry of Finance at the National Likin Abolition Committee meeting in July 1928, now that likin and all similar taxes have been abolished, the business tax in various places must be implemented in accordance with the original plan of the Likin Abolition Conference, and the ministry has prepared thirteen supplementary measures, and copied the general guidelines for business tax in various provinces, and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for instructions. It is said that the general guidelines for the collection of business tax in various provinces recently promulgated by the Ministry of Finance were indeed handled in accordance with the original plan of the Likin Abolition Conference in 1928, but why are there differences in the content and articles, and the different articles are all important. According to the fifth article of the recently promulgated guidelines by the ministry, each province should establish a business tax review committee to collect business tax, and its members should include representatives from the chamber of commerce, which shows that the central government does have the intention of sincerely adopting opinions. The general guidelines set by the Likin Abolition Conference in 1928 were determined after careful consideration and are the result of merchants' opinions. As the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce stated in its telegram to the Ministry of Finance on the day, the two taxes currently being discussed, the special consumption tax and the business tax, both have guidelines set at the Likin Abolition Conference, and they must be implemented in accordance with them to avoid abuses. Your esteemed association leads the merchants, and we in the lower regions admire you. We request that you present an explanation to the ministry as to why the recently promulgated business tax guidelines are inconsistent with those agreed upon at the Likin Abolition Conference in 1928, and request that they be implemented in accordance with them to stabilize business and avoid abuses. Therefore, we enclose the general guidelines for business tax set by the Likin Abolition Conference in 1928 as a substitute for a telegram. We await your decision with eager anticipation."</p>

<p>The Ministry of Finance is reorganizing the salt fields, raising the status and authority of the field directors to increase administrative efficiency and merging the field areas to reduce expenses. The original eleven fields in Huainan have been merged into six fields: Miaowan merged with Xinxing, Donghe merged with Anliang, Dingxi merged with Caoyan, Pinjiao merged with Fengjue, Lvsi merged with Yuzhong. The general field director of Tongtai belonged to a transfer agency, which was abolished at the end of December last year. The original twenty-six fields in Liangzhe have been merged into sixteen fields: Xucun merged with Huangwan, Haisha merged with Baolang, Dongjiang merged with Sanjiang, Dasong Chuanzhang merged with Qingquan, Shangwang merged with Shuangsui, Minghe field was abolished, Songjiang's four fields were merged into one field, which is Qingcun and Liangpu merging into Yuanpu, and Chongming field was abolished. All of these changes have been in effect since February 1st. It is said that the standard for the abolishment and merger is based on the overall planning of production, affairs, and transportation.</p>
<h3 id="e66">### Reasons for Liu Shufan's Exclusive Appointment to Postal Savings <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Communications presented a request to the Executive Yuan to transfer Liu Shufan to be the full-time Director-General of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, in recognition of his achievements in handling postal savings and remittance matters, in order to delegate responsibility to him. Long Dafu, the section chief, was promoted to the position of Director of the Postal Department that Liu Shufan originally held concurrently, and Qian Chunqi was appointed to the position of Director-General of the Postal Bureau that Liu Shufan originally held concurrently. All were appointed by the National Government and sworn into office at the auditorium of the Ministry of Communications on February 2nd. The original submission from the Ministry of Communications is recorded below: "Liu Shufan, Director of the Postal Department and concurrently Director-General of the Postal Bureau of this ministry, was specially appointed as the plenipotentiary representative of the Republic of China to attend the Universal Postal Union Congress two years ago. After the meeting, the ministry sent him to Europe, America, and Japan to study postal matters. Afterwards, he reported that the postal savings and remittance business in various countries was extremely successful, and that our country should emulate it. Therefore, he was tasked with actively preparing for it. Subsequently, the regulations of the Bureau were promulgated, and considering that he had more than 30 years of experience in handling postal matters, and that he had gained much knowledge of savings and remittance matters through his overseas investigations, he was selected to concurrently serve as the Director-General of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, while the Vice Minister Wei Yifu temporarily served as the Director-General of the Postal Bureau. It was reported to the Executive Yuan for approval. Since the Bureau was established on March 15th of last year, it has only been a few months, but the results have been good. Judging from its development, it is not enough to have a dedicated person in charge to take on this important task. It is proposed to transfer him to serve exclusively as the Director-General of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, and to remove him from his original position as Director of the Postal Department and concurrently Director-General of the Postal Bureau, in order to focus his responsibilities. For the vacant position of Director of the Postal Department, there is Long Dafu, the current chief of the first section of the Postal Department, who is experienced and capable and has been handling postal affairs for many years, and his qualifications are very deep. It is proposed to appoint him as Director of the Postal Department. For the vacant position of Director-General of the Postal Bureau, there is Qian Chunqi, a technician with excellent talent and learning, who served as a counselor to Representative Liu at the Universal Postal Union Congress last year and has made many plans for postal reform since returning to China. It is proposed to transfer him to be Director-General of the Postal Bureau. We ask that the Executive Yuan review and implement the above reasons for the sake of public convenience."</p>
<h3 id="e67">### Anhui People Again Request the Abolition of Salt Surcharges <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>In order to raise funds for the provincial defense army, the Anhui Provincial Government collected a surcharge on salt tax in northern and southern Anhui of 2.4 yuan per stone. The people of Anhui, unable to bear the burden, publicly elected Peng Zhuoru, Yang Yaonan, and others as representatives from the mass organizations of 21 counties in northern Anhui to petition in Beijing. Although the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance repeatedly issued orders to abolish it, the Anhui Provincial Government did not comply. Recently, it has been vigorously enforced and forced to pay. The representatives, feeling the urgency, sent another telegram to the central government yesterday, appealing for a strict order to be issued to the Anhui Provincial Government to implement the abolition, and would not stop until the goal was achieved. The telegram is recorded below: "Chairman of the National Government and Premier of the Executive Yuan Jiang, Minister of Finance Song, for your consideration. We, the representatives, were publicly elected by the mass organizations of 21 counties in northern Anhui to petition in Beijing for the abolition of the salt surcharge in Anhui Province. We have repeatedly petitioned and have been repeatedly ordered by your esteemed Executive Yuan and Ministry to abolish it. All the people of Anhui are deeply grateful. We, the representatives, should have waited quietly for the resolution, how dare we bother you again? However, we have just received a letter from Wabao stating that the Bengbu Bureau has not complied with the order to abolish the salt surcharge and has reported it, and there are telegrams about sealing salt warehouses and arresting the ringleaders. Merchants and citizens are in a state of panic. Bengbu is located in the central hub of the southern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, and commerce is concentrated there. Salt and grain have always been fundamental. If salt and grain are suddenly heavily taxed, merchants will not dare to risk investing in transportation, and all industries will be shut down. The livelihood of tens of millions of laborers will be cut off. At a time when the communists are lurking, if an accident occurs, the impact on local security will be enormous. The central government rules the provinces, and the provinces rule the counties. This is the legal procedure. Now, the Anhui Provincial Government has arbitrarily added a salt surcharge, disrupting the salt administration, violating the law, and acting willfully, causing the central government's policy of abolishing likin to be unable to be implemented. Anhui Province is in a state of decline, and the people's livelihood has been suffering for a long time. How can the people recognize this illegal surcharge, which adds millions of burdens every year? We, the representatives, came to Beijing to petition, determined to sacrifice ourselves. Threats and inducements are of no concern to us. We know that this action will inevitably incur the resentment of the provincial government, and it will be easy to find fault in the future. However, we, the representatives, are pleading for the people, concerning the greatest suffering of the people in 21 counties. Even if we risk execution, we will not hesitate. Therefore, we are submitting this report again, hoping that the Chairman and your esteemed Ministry will quickly telegraph the Anhui Provincial Government, ordering them to abolish this salt surcharge immediately, in order to uphold the law and alleviate the people's hardship. We await your orders with utmost fear and trepidation. Peng Zhuoru, Yang Yaonan, and others, representatives of the petitioning group of the people of 21 counties in northern Anhui, together with Qiu Yuzhou and Xiang Yuncheng, and others of the Bengbu Chamber of Commerce, the Huai Salt Transport Merchants Association, and the Salt Industry Association, bow respectfully."</p>
<h3 id="e68">### Qingdao Consolidated Tax Bureau Prepares to Start Collecting Taxes <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Implementation to Begin on February 1st</p>
<p>Registration of Existing Inventory and Payment of Supplementary Taxes</p>
<p>Qingdao Communication: Since its establishment, the Qingdao Luyu Consolidated Tax Bureau has continued to collect taxes on the original two items, cigarettes and wheat flour, and has not yet begun to collect taxes on the three newly added items, cotton yarn, cement, and matches. Now, the bureau has received a telegram order from the Ministry of Finance, approving the implementation of the collection of the consolidated tax on all three unhandled items starting on February 1st. After receiving the order, Director Pan Yaorong has ordered his subordinates to prepare accordingly and decided to start collecting taxes on February 1st. In addition to reporting the handling situation to the Ministry of Finance, he also notified the factories concerned to comply. All the resident factory staff have also been announced and assigned to the factories to take up their duties. The letter from the bureau to the Qingdao Chamber of Commerce and the supplementary tax measures are recorded below:</p>
<p>Letter to the Chamber of Commerce: This bureau previously received instructions from the Ministry of Finance to handle the consolidated tax on cotton yarn, matches, and cement in Shandong and Henan, and immediately prepared to proceed. Now, it has been completed and the collection will begin on February 1st of this year. However, it has been discovered that goods without tax bills or code symbols will be punished in accordance with the tax evasion regulations. If the supplementary tax measures are not notified in advance, merchants may suffer unexpected losses, which is not the intention of this bureau to care for the merchants. Therefore, four supplementary tax measures for cotton yarn, matches, and cement are formulated. In addition to public announcements and separate letters, the text of the measures is hereby sent to your association for your information. Please assist and notify merchants and others to comply.</p>
<p>Supplementary tax measures: (1) The inventory of cotton yarn, matches, and cement in various factories that has not been shipped out should be stopped from moving three days before the start of collection, and the resident factory staff should be allowed to check and register. When the goods are shipped out, the consolidated tax should be paid in accordance with the prescribed procedures. (2) The inventory in various customs warehouses should also be stopped from moving three days before the start of collection. The warehouse manager and the consigning merchants should report to the resident customs office and allow them to check and register. The consolidated tax should be paid up on the day of collection, and the tax bill should be issued after printing the inspection code and stamping the symbol, and then the goods can be picked up. (3) The stock of goods sold by merchants or wholesalers should also be stopped from moving three days before the start of collection, but each merchant is allowed to dismantle a certain amount of goods for retail, but must report the number of pieces in advance and pay the supplementary tax on the day of collection. (4) Goods stored in other warehouses (various banks or companies) by factories due to loans or other reasons should also be stopped from moving three days before the start of collection. The resident factory staff should check the number and pay the supplementary tax at the management office in charge on the day of collection, and then print the original factory inspection code and stamp the symbol. The tax bill may be issued as a general tax bill first, and then a separate transportation bill may be issued when sold in the future, or the factory may request to issue a zero-number tax bill at its discretion.

<h3 id="e69">Changes in the Chinese Director of the Chinese Eastern Railway <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Guo Chongxi Dismissed, Fan Qiguang Succeeds</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: Since the incident on the Chinese Eastern Railway in 1929, the positions and powers of key personnel on the railway, such as the Director and Department Heads, have been different from those of ordinary transportation agencies with only specialized skills. They must possess both transportation and diplomatic acumen to handle matters effectively. Without transportation knowledge, it is increasingly impossible to cope with the actions of the Russians in the vast Russian sphere of influence, and the Russian side will inevitably act unilaterally, disregarding the Chinese side. Without diplomatic experience, it is difficult to deal with the Russians' numerous cunning schemes when an incident occurs. This is especially necessary for the Director, because the Chinese Eastern Railway Bureau system is inherently abnormal. The Russian side has one Director and one Deputy Director, while the Chinese side has only one Deputy Director as assistant. Without a capable person, there is no opportunity to speak or ask questions. After the 1929 incident, former Director Lü Ronghuan issued a statement blaming Chinese Deputy Director Guo Chongxi, saying that he was weak and incompetent. Although not entirely true, Guo's timidity caused problems not infrequently. After the signing of the Khabarovsk Protocol and the restoration of the Chinese Eastern Railway to its original state, Guo, the Director who was dismissed by Lü Ronghuan, also benefited from Russian influence and was restored to his original position. Last spring, when Mo Dehui came to take office as Supervisor, he planned to remove Guo for his poor performance. Later, he went to Russia and had no time for this. When Mo returned to China before the New Year, Guo, knowing that he was inevitable, submitted his resignation in advance. Mo then forwarded it to the Ministry of Railways and the Northeast Transportation Committee for approval. On the 18th of this month, Mo went from Harbin to Liaoning to personally report to Zhang Xueliang. Zhang also considered the powers and status of the Director of the Chinese Eastern Railway to be important and instructed to select diplomatic talent for the position. There was discussion about transferring the current Acting Chairman of the Chinese Eastern Railway, Li Shaogeng, but since Mo was still going to Russia for meetings and the Acting Chairman was also important, they discussed the next best option. It was decided to transfer Fan Qiguang, a Director of the Chinese Eastern Railway, to fill the position. Fan had served as Consul in Boli (Khabarovsk) and Heihe, Russia, and as a Director of the Chinese Eastern Railway for many years. Choosing the right person for the job, it was deemed appropriate. Therefore, on the 20th of this month, Mo summoned Li and Fan to meet Zhang Xueliang and immediately telegraphed the Ministry of Railways to issue an official announcement. As for Fan's vacant Director position, it will be filled by Zhang Shou Zeng, the current Director of the Heihe Municipal Preparatory Office. This must also be officially announced by the Ministry of Railways. Although Guo Chongxi has not yet handed over his duties, he is no longer handling affairs. Several Department Heads related to Guo are also rushing to hand over their duties. In less than ten days, the situation on the Chinese Eastern Railway will have a new look. (January 29th)</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau, recognizing that weather changes are closely related to water conservancy, agriculture, transportation, and other aspects, has established a weather station within the bureau. Branch weather stations will be established in the construction bureaus of various counties, and water gauges will be set up along the Yangtze River and the Grand Canal to observe water levels. It is reported that the weather instruments for the main and branch stations were ordered from famous manufacturers in England and Germany and have been arriving continuously. Once they are fully installed, observations will begin. The results will be reported twice daily, in the morning and afternoon, by the provincial radio station to the Nanjing Central Station, the Xujiahui Station in Shanghai, the Qingdao Special Municipality, the Shandong Construction Department, and other weather stations in the country for reference. The daily weather forecast for the next 24 hours in Zhenjiang will be published in newspapers after several days of testing.</p>
<p>Also, the clocks in the provincial capital are inconsistent and lack standardization, causing inconvenience to all sectors. It is reported that the station is studying the use of noon cannons or other methods to provide a standard for timekeeping for all sectors.</p>

<p>Shenyang Dispatch: Mo Dehui, the plenipotentiary representative for the Sino-Soviet Conference, arrived in Shenyang a few days ago to pay respects to Deputy Commander Zhang. He then went to Tanggangzi with his secretary for rest. He telegraphed Foreign Minister Wang, saying, "Minister Wang Rutang, my dear brother, I hope this reaches you well. I am still suffering from skin disease and insomnia, and plan to go to the hot springs for a few days to recuperate, and will come south immediately. I expect to arrive in Beijing around the end of the month. I am sending this telegram in advance." Now, because Mo is eager to go south, he returned to Shenyang on the 24th. He has been in consultation with Deputy Commander Zhang and various administrative committee members for several days. By the 27th, the opinions of the leaders had converged, and Mo's mission in Shenyang was completed. He left Shenyang south today (30th) at 7:00 PM with Deputy Foreign Minister Wang Jiazhen, Special Commissioner Li Chen, Secretary Wu Zesheng, and others. Many important figures in the political world went to the station to see him off. It is reported that Mo will not delay in Tianjin and will immediately enter Beijing. (30th)</p>

<p>A Fifteen-Year-Old Girl Seduced and Detained: Bian Qiaolin, a girl from Wuxi residing in Sijing Town, is only fifteen years old and has some beauty. She was seduced by Zhang Shuming of the Sijing Rope Shop a few days ago, causing inflammation of her lower body. Her family discovered this and reported it to the local branch station, requesting an investigation. Officer Zhang ordered the police to arrest Zhang. Because the case involved allegations of rape and was a criminal matter, it was prepared and sent to Songjiang and then to the Prosecutor's Office for investigation. The girl, Bian Qiaolin, was transferred to Songjiang Hospital for examination to determine if she was a virgin. It is reported that the hospital has confirmed and submitted its findings for review.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Banditry in Punan: Bandits are rampant in various towns in Punan, and the people are living in misery. Robberies and kidnappings are heard of almost daily. The night before last (1st), more than ten bandits suddenly came to the home of Zhang Xiangyu in Xiaheng Southwest of Tinglin, each carrying sharp knives and axes, and entered to commit robbery. During the commotion, Xie Zikun, a neighbor, heard the noise and went out to investigate, but was slashed by a bandit guarding the area, causing serious injuries. However, the losses were not too great because the bandits, seeing that they had caused trouble, hastily fled. It is also reported that a few days ago, dozens of bandits wearing copper basin hats and white edges suddenly came to the Qianxiang area, divided into the Public Security Bureau and the District Office, intending to coerce the leaders. However, the town merchants, seeing the situation, were alarmed and wanted to go to the door, but were stopped by the bandits, who claimed, "We are not local bandits, nor are we kidnappers. We are here to raise funds." They ordered the pointing out of more than thirty wealthy households in the town, wanting to raise 12,000 yuan. As a result, in addition to looting police weapons, they also took away a list of wealthy households.</p>

Yesterday (1st), he took police officers to Shanghai and reported to the local police station. Two men from Jiangbei, Jiang Huanzhang and Chen Sishan (nicknamed "Big Head"), were arrested in houses at 602 Xiaoshadu Road in the Public Concession and in Yichang Lane.

<p>Communist from Jiangyin Arrested in Wuxi: Lu Zibao, a famous communist leader from Jiangyin, was arrested and executed in that county. His followers, Wang Fuquan and others, continued to commit murder and arson in the county. Qian Tianxiong, the captain of the water patrol team of the local county police brigade, received a report from an informant stating that Wang Fuquan, a communist from Jiangyin, had fled to Suzhou last month, robbed a family named Mao in Huqiu, and had now come to Wuxi, hiding in a certain place in the South Gate of the county.

<p>Collection of Storefront Rent Donation in the Urban Area: The County Government previously received an order from the Department of Civil Affairs instructing it to investigate and report when the storefront rent donation in the urban area was approved for collection, how it has been collected in the past, how much is collected annually, and what it is used for. The County Government immediately sent a letter to the City Property Management Committee for investigation and reporting. The City Property Management Committee replied that the storefront rent donation in the urban area has been collected by local self-government organizations since the late Qing Dynasty during the preparation for self-government, and is specifically used for police expenses. In September of the 18th year of the Republic (1929), the former Municipal Preparatory Office revised the regulations for collecting storefront rent donations, which were approved by the Department of Civil Affairs under Order No. 22325. Calculated at 10% of the actual rent, the monthly amount to be collected in the urban area is 5,390.274 yuan, but the average actual monthly collection is only more than 5,000 yuan, which is not enough to cover the 5,500 yuan allocated monthly for urban public security expenses. Yesterday, the situation was reported to the County Government, along with the regulations for collecting storefront rent donations, for forwarding to the Department of Civil Affairs for record.</p>

<p>Chamber of Commerce Cables Request to Revise Business Tax Rate: The Wuyi County Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Executive Yuan of the Nanjing National Government and the Ministry of Finance yesterday (2nd), stating that according to Article 4 of the Outline for the Collection of Business Tax in Various Provinces promulgated by the Executive Yuan, the business tax rate should be calculated and collected at a rate of per mille based on the taxable standard and should not exceed 2 per mille. Recently, it was read in the newspaper that the tax rates stipulated in the Jiangsu Province Business Tax Regulations were more than ten times higher than the outline, which was clearly inconsistent with the central government's orders. All businesses were alarmed and appealed, requesting a reduction or exemption to alleviate business difficulties. In recent years, business conditions have been depressed, and all industries have been struggling. Bankruptcies and closures have been frequently heard of. Even if the government does not provide relief, it should show sympathy and reduce taxes to allow for recovery. Now, it is still violating the principles of the outline promulgated by the Executive Yuan and increasing the burden on businesses and the people, which is not a way to save the people and support businesses. Therefore, we specially telegraph the Executive Yuan and the Ministry, humbly asking you to consider the difficulties of businesses and quickly order the Jiangsu Provincial Government to revise the tax rate according to the outline, so that the businesses and the people who are on the verge of collapse can catch their breath.</p>

Commerce has been increasingly prosperous recently. The proposal to build a long-distance telephone branch line in Tonglu Fenshui, which was decided at the previous construction conference, has not yet been implemented. However, there is an increasing need for it recently. Please order the Construction Department to expedite its construction to facilitate transportation and benefit the entire province. The report is factual. Your department should quickly investigate and handle it to satisfy the people's hopes. Yesterday, Director Shi ordered the Telephone Bureau to plan and prepare for construction.</p>
<p>Hangzhou Tap Water Implemented Trial Water: The Hangzhou Tap Water Preparatory Committee has recently buried a section of water pipes from outside Gulou to Yan Gong Lane, which has been completed. Fearing that the installation may not be appropriate, trial water was conducted first, and the results were very good. However, because the terrain from the mouth of Yan Gong Lane to the Ziyang Mountain Reservoir is from bottom to top, and the lane is too winding, it is feared that there will be obstacles in pumping water to the reservoir in the future, and the amount of power consumption will also be large. Therefore, it is proposed to ask the Municipal Government to straighten Yan Guan Lane to facilitate progress. Construction can begin in a few days.</p>

<p>▲Money that can be accumulated but not spent inevitably turns one into a miser. Money that can be spent but not accumulated inevitably turns one into a spendthrift.</p>
<p>▲By not setting foot in places of pleasure, gambling, etc., one not only cherishes wealth but also cherishes one's body. By paying attention to useful books, whether Chinese or Western, one not only increases wisdom but also increases virtue.</p>
<p>▲Knowing the bitterness of asking for help from others, one should be even more frugal when one has extra money. Knowing the difficulty of entrusting others to handle matters, those who are in position should not be greedy for more.</p>
<p>▲Miserly families often produce prodigal sons. Acrimonious children are sure to be failures.</p>
<p>▲When one is in the world, one must have pride, but not arrogance. When parents love their children, they do not need to leave them property, but they must give them skills.</p>
<p>▲Instead of haggling over every penny in the vegetable market, why not eat one less bite yourself? Instead of arguing red-faced with a rickshaw puller over the fare, why not walk a few more steps yourself?</p>
<p>▲Heaven and earth are the lodging places of all things, so great wealth and honor are just empty dreams. Why take them too seriously? Time is a passerby for a hundred generations, so whether one is a saint or a madman, one should seize every moment. How can one not cherish it?</p>
<p>▲A single word of greed can lead to the bankruptcy and ruin of the rich. A single word of diligence can enable the poor to start a business and prosper.</p>
<p>▲Not reading dead books is true learning. Being able to recognize small resentments is called a great hero.</p>
<p>▲Those who are content always have more joy. Those who are never content have little happiness throughout the year.</p>
<p>▲Those who like to talk about the shortcomings of others behind their backs are certainly not upright people. I should be careful in dealing with them. Those who can point out my faults to my face are certainly warm-hearted people. I should befriend them well.</p>
<p>▲Entering a good family is like sitting in the spring breeze, making one feel refreshed. Reading bad novels is like falling into a demon's lair, making one's mind confused.</p>
<p>▲Flowers are best when half-open. One should leave some room when drinking alcohol.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Strange Customs of Mongolia Zhao Lanhuan <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, I attended a friend's banquet and met an old man in his sixties. He claimed to have just returned from the northern border. During the banquet, he spoke at length about the customs of Inner Mongolia, as if they were his own family treasures. I will record its strange points to share with readers.</p>
<p>▲Difficulty in Asking for Directions: The most inconvenient thing for travelers entering Mongolia for the first time is the difficulty in asking for directions. Mongolians consider it shameful to speak Chinese and delightful for Chinese to speak Mongolian well. Chinese who speak Mongolian well will certainly receive enthusiastic hospitality wherever they go. If one speaks Chinese to ask for directions, Mongolians will certainly ignore them, even if one begs on one's knees.</p>
<p>▲Lamas in Power: The administrative power of all Mongolian tribes is controlled by lamas. Once orders are issued, the people must obey. Moreover, Mongolians worship lamas, so if there are two sons, one must be chosen to become a lama. Although restricted by religious rules and not allowed to marry, the material benefits are very generous, and there is hope of holding great power in the future. Therefore, Mongolians see becoming a lama as a shortcut to promotion and wealth. There are no doctors in Mongolia. When someone is sick, the lama will diagnose them, often using tree bark and animal bones as medicine, and many recover safely.</p>
<p>▲The Custom of Polygamy: Mongolia is a vast desert, but the water and grass are lush, making it easy for nomads to live. Most of the people make a living from this, and there are very few idlers. Women work especially hard. Men only engage in outdoor herding, while women, in addition to managing household affairs, also milk livestock in the morning and evening. The wealthy often marry multiple wives and concubines to share the work, and there is no distinction between wives and concubines.</p>
<p>▲Trade by Barter: Any Chinese who are familiar with Mongolian customs will profit when they go to do business. Trade is conducted by barter, and very little is done with cash. The method is to first distribute goods to Mongolians at the beginning of the year, and in the winter, take livestock, bones, leather, fur, and other items of equivalent value. Mongolians</p>

<p>Spring Everlasting (Chun Bu Lao): Mustard greens are pickled and stored for over a month, removing the pungent taste. They are eaten as an appetizer,</p>
<p>remarkably delicious.</p>
<p>Spring Bamboo Shoots: The shells of spring bamboo shoots are peeled off, and the tips are picked. They are stir-fried with shrimp roe, soy sauce, and a little lard, then removed after two or three stirs. They are extraordinarily tender.</p>
<p>Spring Rolls: Fillings of leek sprouts and shredded pork are wrapped in wrappers to form rolls. They are placed in a lard wok and fried until golden brown on both sides. They are crispy and delicious.</p>
<p>▲ Spring Pancakes: Finely shred radish and mix with flour and salt. Fry in an oil wok until cooked and eat immediately, known as "biting the spring."</p>
<p>Honest and reliable, with very little dispute, it is said.</p>
<p>▲ An Unconventional Funeral: Mongolian funerals are particularly strange. When someone dies, regardless of age, they are not placed in a coffin. Instead, the body is moved to a wilderness area frequented by wolves, tigers, and leopards to satisfy their hunger. After a few days, if the body has been eaten by wild animals, it is said that the person has ascended to heaven. Otherwise, it is said that the person was extremely sinful, and the whole family considers it unlucky, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Thirty-Year-Old Blind Man Regains His Sight in Autumn <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>In Poet's Valley, America, there is a blind merchant named Fish. J.F. Fish lost his sight due to eye disease thirty years ago. On the evening of a certain day in early July of last year, he suddenly felt something in front of him, gradually becoming clear. Both eyes actually regained their sight. Because of the interesting nature of this event, he wrote it down.</p>
<p>▲ Wedding Bliss Turns to Calamity: Thirty-one years ago today (i.e., 1899), Fish had just graduated from university and married his beloved in Poet's Valley. They went to Wahawa for their honeymoon. One day, while walking in the countryside with his wife, they rested under a large tree. Suddenly, a branch broke off and fell to the ground, hitting the groom's eye and injuring it. The bride accompanied him home and sought medical treatment, but it was ineffective, and he became blind. Over the years, he had spent over 50,000 gold coins on medical expenses to treat his eyes, but to no avail. Now, when all hope was lost, he suddenly regained his sight, which is quite remarkable.</p>
<p>▲ Interesting Dark Life: Fish, a promising young man, suddenly suffered the pain of blindness. His life was dark, and he had no joy in living. One can imagine. However, he was quite content in his thirty years of darkness. He had profound knowledge to interact with society. He had no worries about the family being well-fed and clothed. He also had a virtuous wife who served him every day. He had no internal worries and enjoyed family happiness. Although his eyes were blind, his heart was happy. One evening, while sitting on the side of the courtyard, his wife was reciting a novel for him. Fish suddenly felt a slight light shining in front of him. The light gradually increased. Suddenly, he saw a chair in the darkness. After a long time, he saw a picture. After a long time, he saw his wife sitting beside him. Fish was extremely shocked and stood up, saying, "The world has turned upside down! Where shall I place myself? Wife, I see you!" Then they hugged and kissed, and cried, "Thirty years of separation, I can see you again. God is so merciful." The next day, he told his relatives and friends. His relatives and friends were also overjoyed and threw a party to celebrate. At the banquet, Fish said to the crowd, "After twenty years of separation, your faces are no longer the same as before. The social situation has also been completely renewed, very different from before. Recalling the situation thirty years ago is like another lifetime. My heart is extremely happy. Please offer sincere thanks to God for me."</p>

<p>Thirteen, The Botanical Garden</p>
<p>Almost every city in France with a university has a very complete botanical garden (jardindesplantes), the scale of which is naturally larger and more complete than those in the provinces.</p>
<p>Coming out of the University of Paris, walk along Rue Saint-Jacques to the bank of the Seine. Turn and walk east along the riverbank. In a dozen minutes, you will reach the west gate of the Botanical Garden. A leisurely stroll along the riverbank is already very refreshing. But after you enter the Botanical Garden, your mind will be even lighter. In the fifth arrondissement, where most students live, the Botanical Garden can be considered the second most suitable place for students to rest, after the Luxembourg Gardens that I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>The Botanical Garden is not as large as the Luxembourg Gardens in area, and the scenery is far less beautiful than the Luxembourg Gardens. But this place has a benefit that ordinary parks do not have. You can gain a lot of knowledge by walking around here. There are more than 11,000 kinds of plants in this garden, all categorized scientifically. In front of each plant is a sign indicating its scientific name, common name, and origin, etc. Almost all kinds of different plants from all over the world have one or two specimens. Walking around here is like surveying the plants of the world.</p>
<p>The garden also has a zoo attached, but you have to buy a separate ticket to enter. There are also several kinds of animals inside that Chinese people rarely see. But this zoo is ultimately an ancillary nature and not very large. There is another complete large zoo outside the city of Paris. I will introduce it in a separate article later.</p>
<p>Bees are certainly good at making honey. A painting society adopts the name "Bee," and its diligence in production can be imagined. The gentlemen of the Bee Society, at the end of the Gengwu year, when the wind and snow were fierce, to pass the cold, opened the New World Hotel and gathered in a room. They sat around the stove, brewed wine, and mixed powder to prepare pigments. The elegance of the art world was exhausted. After a dozen days, they examined their paintings and obtained 200 pieces of fine art, which were publicly exhibited. I, Yu Dao, passed by Xizang Road and took the opportunity to admire them. I exclaimed in admiration. Zhang Shanzi's painting of tigers had the menacing power to pounce on people. Combined with Ma Qizhou's embellishment of trees and rocks, the craftsmanship was equally matched. Ye Weishen's painting of white doves was complemented by Wang Shizi's roses, with elegant colors and exquisite charm. Shang Shengbo's painting "Wine and Meat Friends" showed a piece of fatty meat and a mound of yellow soil, with a unique flavor. Sun Xueni's "Firewood and Rice Couple" showed a rice basket and a bundle of firewood, also quite wonderful. Xi Yanzi titled a poem, saying, "I heard that it is not easy to live in Chang'an, firewood is like jade cinnamon, and rice is like pearls. I laugh at the poor couple who guard their old house in the wind and snow." Yanzi has been wandering in recent years, and his poems are full of complaints. The old dream of black clothes makes him unconsciously sigh deeply. Others, such as Xiong Songquan's painting of lions, Ma Mengrong's red carp, and Shen Jianzhi and He Tianjian's landscapes, competed for beauty, which is worth mentioning. As for the "Three Friends of Winter," Zheng Wuchang painted pines, Qian Shoutie painted plums, with misty smoke and delicate elegance, and Sun Xueni's double-hooked new bamboo, with lush green depths and dense thickets, creating the sound of wind through the pines. It is truly rare. I especially admire Ye Weishen's large horizontal landscape painting, with its lofty spirit and splashed ink. Du Fu's poem "The walls are covered with scenes of Xiao and Xiang" seems to be written for this painting. In terms of its charm, it is between Xiangyang and bitter gourd, but it is not limited to one style. It is transformed with brushstrokes, so in the midst of the ancient and vigorous, it also obtains a clear, exquisite, and charming style. Xie Yucen, Wang Geshan, and Zheng Wuchang each wrote a poem to praise it. The diligent bees, whose carving is as refined as described above, I hope that the literary and artistic world of our East will also rely on the support of these gentlemen.</p>
<p>▲ Plum News: In the past, Fan Chengda wrote a preface to the Plum Manual, calling plums the most precious thing in the world. He also said that plums are superior in charm and high in character. Therefore, the most prized plums are those with a horizontal, oblique, sparse, and elegant shape, with old trunks and forked branches. Famous sages such as Song Guangping, Du Shaoling, and Lin Hejing all had diplomatic relations with plums, which is reasonable. Now there are plums produced by Xiaoguanyuan, such as Shunfeng plums, Jianjin plums, Gubengpi plums, Hejing pine bamboo plum, peony camellia plum, and other bonsai, each with its own posture. Since they were put on the market, buyers have flocked to them. The retail departments at the west entrance of the Great World on Avenue Edward VII and the distribution point next to the Shishi Xinbao on Wangping Street are all overwhelmed, it is said.

<p>Chapter 17: The Art of Preserving Youthful Looks with Emerald Black Eyebrows, Continuing Life is Impossible with a Golden Market of Fine Horses</p>
<p>Ason’s several Hansom cabs were all spruced up exceptionally well. The body of the carriage was lacquered to be immaculate, so shiny it could be used as a mirror. The cushions were all made of royal blue satin and daffodil-yellow satin, embroidered with many colorful flowers. The reins were made of green silk ribbon. The carriage was equipped with a soft rattan whip that was over ten feet long, tied with alternating blue and white silk, section by section, also decorated with red, purple, yellow, and green tassels, fluttering in the wind, looking even more beautiful in the shadow of the setting sun. The carriage was not only lightweight, but also harnessed to a black-cloud piebald horse, whose four hooves kicked up the wind, galloping as fast as a cloud dragon. The horse was as nimble and energetic as its driver. During the third month's excursions to Longhua to see the peach blossoms, and the New Year's five-day head start on the circular route, to show off, and the spring and autumn racing seasons, these fashionable gentlemen from the "Tangzi" establishments would all vie to ride Ason’s carriage. On those days, Ason's limelight was even stronger. The Hansom cab was light and small, unable to seat many people, at most accommodating three. It was best to sit shoulder to shoulder with the coachman, letting the coachman hold the reins. Otherwise, if two female companions were seated in the front, the coachman could still have a seat from behind and pull the reins through the gaps between the shoulders of the two women in the front. Hua Yuanchun was someone who enjoyed showing off and had a competitive nature. She often learned to hold the reins herself, personally instructed by Ason, and gradually became close. Therefore, what others could not snatch, she had already snatched first. Hua Yuanchun got two people she liked. However, these two people could not meet. But she was unwilling to offend either of them or abandon either of them. It was like what Mencius said, "Fish, I desire; bear's paw, I also desire." This relied on the means of the "Tangzi" establishment. A single girl serves two clients. If she did not have the means, things could go wrong, leading to jealousy and disputes. The furnishings in the room would be smashed, and cups and dishes would fly everywhere, making it difficult to please both sides, forcing her into a corner with no way out, even to the point of swallowing raw opium to commit suicide. Girls with means could pour sweet talk on both sides. To Client A, she would make mountain oaths and sea alliances, claiming that he was the only one she loved most. To Client B, she would also point to the heavens and swear by the sun, saying that there was no one else but him. "Having seen the great sea, water is difficult to be anything else; except for Mount Wu, clouds are not clouds," was also one of their secrets. The first step was to make Client A unaware of Client B, and Client B unaware of Client A, creating an impression of separation. Even if the truth leaked out, she could still patch things up. To Client A, she would say that she was completely devoted to him. To Client B, she was merely being perfunctory. On the other hand, she would say the same to Client B. When they were bewitched by her, both Client A and Client B would believe her words. All the skilled people in the brothel could do this. Hua Yuanchun was naturally a famous courtesan in Shanghai at the time. Therefore, she could still drive side by side, even though her two beloved enemies were traveling on separate paths.</p>

<h3 id="e92">Fierce Rise in Gold Prices <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Increase of Eighteen Taels and Two Mace</p>
<p>The market outlook is extremely beautiful. Yesterday, February 3rd, gold prices rose repeatedly and endlessly, almost reaching their peak. From morning to night, there was a total of over seventeen taels of fluctuation. This was due to the continued decline in overseas silver markets, which led to some tightness in Shanghai bills of exchange. Since the previous market, there had been an increase and decrease of eight to nine taels, with varying buying and selling. For example, Chengfeng, Yongfu, Changyu, Cheng Yong, Yuanxing, Yong, etc. were all buying, while Yuanmaoyong, Yongheng, Zhenchang, Xiang, etc. had all sold. The market price had already exceeded 730 taels early on. Later, due to the agility of the sellers, it fell sharply by seven or eight taels. Afterwards, the foreign exchange trend was sharp, and the buyers on the trading floor were still strong, presenting a rising scene again, quickly exceeding 35 taels. The aftermarket was even more expensive, and the bills of exchange were quoted down by half a notch. This was because major players such as Chengfeng, Yongheng, etc. were fiercely short-covering, and the sentiment was extremely firm, advancing in an orderly manner, even exceeding the major threshold of 740 taels. The British exchange rate had almost reached a new low. Recently, it had broken three pence, and the banks' intentions were even firmer. This morning, large bars still needed to fall, and the industry's intentions were the opposite of last week. Now, it is expected that the future still has the possibility of rising again, etc.</p>
<p>The previous market hesitated and lingered. The opening price for March in the morning rose by six taels and seven mace, totaling 732 taels. This was because the large bars had all fallen by one-eighth, and the silver price had steeply contracted by one-half. Especially because the United States was still selling, and private telegrams were also down by one-half. Then, there were mutual ups and downs from 31 taels to 34 taels. Later, because Wanxing, Tongtaichang, Shunli, etc. all unloaded, it turned downwards, until 9:30 AM, it was 30 taels. British gold had been sold by Huabi, Taiwan, Sumitomo, and brokers, etc. for 1325 for April and May. However, HSBC's listing did not change, so it fell to 28 and a half taels again. The domestic market was stable. Banks mutually traded March at 25, and soon rose to 29 taels and eight or nine mace. Retail investors in the field sold, and it retreated to 28 taels, but there were no special changes. Subsequently, Sumitomo ate up the February shilling 25, and the hedge funds came to put in notes, so around 10 o'clock it was 30 taels and 03. After entering, Fuyu, Zhifeng, Yong, etc. tended to sell, and with British gold seeming loose, Chinese and Japanese banks mutually did 133125 for May and June, and it fell by four taels. After 10:30 AM, it was 26 taels and one mace. Afterwards, it presented an upward peak again, but there was an ups and downs, and the bills of exchange were easy to rise. Mitsui bought present Dalian at one tael, five mace, nine fen, and five li, and each bank also did March British gold at 1325. Korea also came out near Dalian at one tael and six mace. On the trading floor, Chengfeng, Yongyuan, Xingyong, Fuchang, etc. fiercely competed to buy, from 10:30 AM to 11:30 AM, a flying increase of over nine taels in this one hour. But there were occasional ups and downs, and it had already risen to 35 and a half taels. At noon, the closing price returned to 33 and a half taels, and rose to 35 taels again. Wanxing, Shunli, and retail investors chased after it, but Zhenchangxiang unloaded more of the long position. The quoted price was still 778 taels and two mace, pressing 50 taels to 43 and 44 taels.</p>
<p>▲ Bold Advance in the Aftermarket: The opening price in the afternoon market was as high as 36 and a half taels, which was the remaining trend after the noon closing. Then, due to the activity of the sellers, it retreated to 34 taels. However, British gold was even firmer. Zhongfu and Mitsui mutually did 131875 for April and May. Afterwards, McGalli, Huabi, and East Asia Mitsui, etc. did 1875 for June, plus Chengfeng Yong, etc. bravely resisted the short position. And with the expectation of British gold changing to a discount, it was two taels. At 1:30 PM, it did discount by one-point two-five, American gold two-five, and Japanese gold added one fen and two-five. It rose to thirty-eight taels. The domestic market was even stronger, only 13125 could be settled. Slightly inferior to one tael plus, at 2:45 PM, it was rebounding again. Chengfeng, Yongheng, Zhifeng Yong, Wanxing Tong, Taichang Shunli, etc. successively bought. The market atmosphere was prosperous. Until 3:30 PM, it suddenly broke through the major threshold of 40 taels. In the meantime, there were over two taels of turnarounds. The sentiment was very firm. Afterwards, hovering around 40 taels, at 3:30 PM, it reached 42 taels. Recently, British gold showed at 130625 to 13. Shortly after, Fuchang Zhifeng Yong slightly sold. Around 4 o'clock, it retreated to 40 taels. After that, it frequently ascended to the sky. Yongheng, etc. scrambled to buy in. The Dalian gang also had an unloading, so the February-March British gold had suddenly fallen within three pence. The banks were unwilling to easily sell. By 4:30 PM, the closing price jumped to 43 and a half taels, a sharp increase of eighteen taels and two mace compared to the day before. After the closing price, it rose to 45 taels again, really because there were few notes, and demand exceeded supply. Checking the highest price for the entire day was 43 and a half taels, and the lowest price was 26 taels and one mace, with a difference of 17 taels and four mace (according to the listed price). Goods market: morning price 32 taels and five, noon closing 34 taels, afternoon 36 taels and two mace, closing price 45 taels. The listed price in the afternoon has been changed to 784 taels and two mace, pressing 46-7 taels to about 40 taels.

<h3 id="e93">Foreign Exchange Even More Tight <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, British, American, and Indian silver markets all declined again. The exchange rate was flat. HSBC's foreign exchange initial listing did not change, only Hong Kong added two-five, totaling seventy-seven taels and two-five. At 2:30 PM, it suddenly changed to half a notch, totaling British gold one-point-two-five. The current price is one shilling and three pence, reaching a new record.

Japanese gold added one fen and two-five, totaling one tael six mace two fen seven-five. The domestic market was also very tight. The gold market had broken out of the 740-tael mark. The sentiment was unusually firm. Major players were covering their short positions, and the sentiment was the opposite of last week, so the gold price still needs to be viewed as rising. Chinese gold firms were scrambling to hedge British gold, totaling about 200,000 pounds, also arbitraging notes. Banks such as Sumitomo, Huabi, Zhengjin, Taiwan, Mitsui, Shanghai, McGalli, etc. were all selling. However, they were psychologically bullish and unwilling to sell easily. Each bank mutually traded 100,000 pounds and also arbitraged American gold 200-300,000 yuan. Small Luzon continued to sell, and American silver companies also came out. Regarding Japanese gold, Huabi and Mitsui had absorbed it in the previous market. In the afternoon, Korea Sanlin sold, totaling about 1 million yuan. However, gold firms did not have large tickets coming in and out due to unsuitable hedging. The resulting price totaled British gold discounting three-one-two-five compared to the day before, almost breaking three pence. American gold discounting six-two-five. Japanese gold adding two fen and two-five. The market atmosphere was even more sharp.</p>

<h3 id="e94">Overseas Silver Prices Decline <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>According to London telegraphic communication yesterday, the price of large bar silver continued to fall. China and India slightly sold in the base and the market was calm due to lack of supply from other parties. After the market closed, it looked dull because the United States sold at the listed price, for example, recent shortening</p>

<p>The overall situation in the market is that the money industry is about to finalize their accounts so they are paying little attention to the buying and selling of silver dollars. Also, the capital is so relaxed, no one cares more, and since payments have been continuing to return from all ports, there is an abundance of cash and there are more offers than requests in the East Corner market. As a result, the price is breaking all records. Copper cents also shrunk accordingly.</p>
<p>▲Daily Loan prices: (Silver Dollars) Buying is quite exhausted, so the price is downstream. The morning market was priced at seven qian two fen 08 hao seven suddenly half, noon was seven qian two fen 06 hao two suddenly half, which is closing to breaking the 2 fen range. (Cash loan) The morning and noon markets were the same at two fen, splitting up to black-out.</p>
<p>The market situation of subsidiary currency is that Jiangnan small dollars were seven qian seven fen one li in the morning, and six qian seven fen two li at noon, meaning there were 2 li of better transactions than the previous day. Five thousand jiao were transacted in the morning and one man zero five hundred jiao at noon. Guangdong small dollars continued to soar by six li, totaling six qian seven fen six li in the morning and six qian seven fen nine li at noon, which is closing to the peak of eight fen. This is due to the scarcity of current goods on the market so this trend is to continue. Transactions were 170,000 jiao in the morning and 85,000 jiao at noon. Copper cents shrunk four thousand, totaling 356,000 wen.</p>
<p>▲Cash and Silver flows: (Silver funds) Yesterday the bank revenue was mediocre, but because of settlements the revenue was busier, totaling 2,700,000 in silver, 1,900,000 for foreign businesses and about 3-4 million for settlement. Miscellaneous bills, tariffs, tax and fees totaled 9 million. Disbursements were one million. The Japanese bank collected 4,200,000 in total, settled one million, disbursed 500,000, and the private banks collected 43.3 million plus settlement revenues of 4.4 million and 1.2 million for external settlements and 1 million in cash.

<p>The tightness of silver was well suited, so the average volume for the month was only around 4 silver taels total for the whole month (based on 26 days with only 3 taels and 5 qian 2 fen and the price for 4 closed days was added which is said to be four taels). Yesterday it was determined that the monthly interest rate should be set at four taels 95 and if overdue, the interest would be added after sitting on 4 taels. Also, to finalize the accounts of the 19th year from February 1 to the 10th, this interest rate will continue to be deliberated. Yesterday it was decided it would be charged 2 taels, 95, and overdue interest was added after sitting on 4 taels, and that from the 11th to 19th for 8-9 days, the money deposited would not be accounted for.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Yarn and Cotton Yarn Market Declining Sharply <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market weakened further, with the decline intensifying slightly. The main reason was that many bulls were taking profits and closing positions, causing market sentiment to loosen. Furthermore, the demand for spot yarn decreased because various groups had purchased enough after the implementation of the new tax, and most are currently adopting a wait-and-see attitude, resulting in stagnant trading. With the settlement period approaching, the willingness to trade is becoming increasingly weak. However, manufacturers remain firm, as their inventory is lower than before, exchange rates are difficult to increase, foreign goods and silver prices are high, and the cotton market is trending upwards, so the yarn market cannot fall significantly in the long run.</p>
<p>▲People's Mark Trending Downward In the pre-market trading of People's Mark yarn, there was a lack of buyers in the market, and market sentiment was loose. Prices fell steadily throughout the day, resulting in declines of 1.8 or 1.9 candareens for all months. In the afternoon, spot yarn business was reported to be slow, and the situation remained weak. This month's contracts fell 1.4 candareens, while distant months fell 4, 5, 8, and 9 candareens. Statistics show that a total of 35,850 bales were traded throughout the day. Tongxing sold 1,700 bales, Tiancheng sold 1,400 bales, Hengchang sold 1,400 bales, and Tianlong sold 1,650 bales. Yuda bought 1,200 bales, Xincheng bought 1,400 bales, and Ruidi bought 1,500 bales. The closing prices are recorded below. People's Mark Closing Prices Rise/Fall Balance May 15.97 Down 2 761 950</p>

<p>April 158.9 2.4 70,00</p>
<p>▲Extremely Scarce Yarn Sales The sales of spot yarn remain extremely scarce. Statistics show that various groups bought a total of 260 bales throughout the day, and the market was generally weak. Customer groups from Nanyang bought 105 bales, Gaoyang bought 20 bales, Hankou bought 25 bales, Yunnan bought 20 bales, inland provinces bought 10 bales, Jiangxi bought 20 bales, Sichuan bought 50 bales, and fellow merchants bought 10 bales.</p>

<p>The cotton market fell in the morning but stabilized in the afternoon. However, there was little change in overseas cotton markets, and exchange rates remained tight, so the bulls did not take any action. However, the yarn market is trending downward, and people's confidence has inevitably been shaken, causing prices to fall slightly. However, imports of foreign cotton are blocked, and speculators are ultimately unwilling to let go, while the supply from Hankou is dwindling, making spot prices very tight.</p>
<p>▲Hankou Mark Falls 3-4 Candareens In the pre-market trading of Hankou Mark cotton, the American cotton market was stable and the yarn market was trending downward, causing market sentiment to loosen and prices to fall 3-4 candareens. In the afternoon, the market rebounded slightly, with prices rising by 0.5 to 1.5 candareens. Statistics show that a total of 62,400 piculs were traded throughout the day. Meiji sold 3,600 piculs, Hengyi sold 4,200 piculs, and Changfeng sold 3,200 piculs. Yuda bought 7,900 piculs, Shenchang bought 3,500 piculs, Ruidi bought 2,300 piculs, and Gongtai bought 2,500 piculs. The closing prices are recorded below.</p>

<p>▲Zhabei Yesterday, 30 to 40 boats arrived from various groups. Sales turned stagnant, but market sentiment remained good. Moreover, the inventory in the lower reaches of the river had decreased by more than 10,000 piculs due to purchases made the previous day, so the price of Northern粳 rice is rising steadily. Top grades continued to open at 13.5 yuan, while medium and lower grades increased by 0.15 yuan. The market for thin paddy rice is stable, but trading is not active, and prices are slightly better by about 0.1 yuan. The trend of Yangxian rice has become slightly stagnant again, but people's confidence seems not weak. High-quality goods are still priced around 12 yuan. Various grades in the middle range have generally seen slight increases. Duxian rice is scarce and inventories are low, and the situation is quiet. Prices at the port are tight at around 0.1 yuan. Merchants still intend to sell at higher prices. The exchange rate conversion is neutral, balancing arrivals and sales. Although the overall trend is still firm, prices are difficult to increase further, and demand is very mediocre. Top grades opened at 13.2-13.3 yuan.</p>
<p>▲Hu Nan Yesterday, few boats arrived from the lower reaches of the river. Sales in this street were quite good, and the situation was more lively than in the northern market. Changxi and other grades of high-quality goods are still strong. Ordinary grades are generally better by 0.2 yuan. Sales of Baijing rice from Sutong and other groups are also brisk, and prices are up by 0.3 yuan, making the market very tight. The supply of thin paddy rice and early rice from the Southern groups is still continuing, but sales are not strong. Overall, prices rose by 0.15 yuan following the general trend. Sales of Yangduxian rice vary depending on customer demand, but according to reports from the production areas, the news is good, and sellers are asking for higher prices, so prices have continued to rise by 0.1-0.2 yuan. Sales of Baiyuan rice have turned brisk, and market prices have generally increased by over 0.1 yuan.</p>

<p>▲Price is Slightly Lower by About 0.1 Yuan</p>
<p>The customer Xian rice market, after having no complete transactions the day before yesterday, saw softer market sentiment yesterday. Guangdong groups took advantage of the lower prices to ship over a thousand bags of Jiangxi Jiming rice. There were also some inquiries in this street, and the market was slightly more active. However, compared to the market prices a few days ago, prices are slightly lower by about 0.1 yuan. Statistics show that a total of 1,300 bags of Jiangxi Jiming rice were traded, priced at 11.5 yuan to 11.32 yuan. 200 bags of Mingguang machine-milled rice were priced at 9.6 yuan. 120 bags of Nanjing brown rice were priced at 8.55 yuan. There were no other transactions.</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, prices in various months once again became lively. Foreign wheat prices improved by about 0.1 yuan, and with strong demand from inland buyers, the market was quite brisk. Subsequently, manufacturers, seeing this opportunity, frequently released their stocks, which undermined the rising trend. By the afternoon opening, foreign merchants came again to peddle foreign wheat, and asking prices loosened again, reportedly only 4 taels per Shanghai yuan. It was also rumored that a certain factory had made a small deal, so the market atmosphere became gloomy again. Manufacturers released their stocks even more enthusiastically (reportedly, Fufu and Liangjia reached around 200,000 bags), and the market plummeted again and again. In the end, the source of foreign wheat was endless, and there was little optimism for the future. As a result, February contracts fell by 0.01 yuan compared to the previous day, March and April contracts fell by 0.0325 yuan, May contracts fell by 0.03 yuan, June contracts fell by 0.025 yuan, and July contracts fell by 0.03 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Wheat Market Softens <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market in the morning, prices continued to be lively due to continued absorption by inland buyers. However, traders and factories, having made a deal for 14,000 tons of Australian wheat at only 4.01 taels the day before yesterday, successively shorted large quantities, so prices gradually softened again for various months. By the afternoon opening, short sellers continued to release their stocks, and factories continued to make deals for foreign wheat, so selling was even more prevalent, and prices for all months softened further. According to this situation, once domestic prices improve, foreign wheat will come to be peddled. It is feared that if a surge of supply is encountered in the future, it will be difficult to avoid falling again. As a result, this month's contracts fell by 0.06 yuan compared to the previous day, March and April contracts fell by 0.04 yuan, May contracts fell by 0.02 yuan, June contracts fell by 0.03 yuan, and July contracts improved by 0.01 yuan.</p>

<p>▲Coarse Sand and White Sugar Trending Upward</p>
<p>Yesterday, according to sugar market dispatches from producing regions, the spot price of Cuban sugar fell by 0.0625 compared to the previous dispatch. New York sugar futures fell by 0.02 for March, 0.01 for May, 0.03 for September, and 0.01 for December. The spot price of Javanese sugar and the price of March futures fell by 0.125-0.25. The new price for April is 8.250. In the Public Association market, the sentiment for Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse sand white sugar was quite strong, but transactions were scarce. The price was 10.05 taels, and high-quality goods were 10.055 taels, a continuous increase from before, and the market outlook was also strong. No. 20 medium sand white sugar was 10 taels, and No. 8 Dutch red sugar was 9.2 taels. Import and export were relatively relaxed, but the market was not weak. Japanese sugar also rose. N mark prices were 10.065 taels, Meiji YP mark was 10.07 taels, YT mark was 10.05-10.055 taels, YRO mark was 10.01 taels, SH mark was 10.03 taels, and T mark was 10.075 taels.

<h3 id="e106">North-South Goods: Sharp Rise in Price Due to Shortage of Orchid Seeds <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The inventory of orchid seeds in Zhangzhou has been completely purchased by Xiamen merchants, so the buying price has risen again by 3-4 yuan. Although Xiamen ships have recently transported some down, the total number of goods in the hands of stores and traders is only dozens of pieces. Considering the cost, it is said to be up to 40 taels, which is an unprecedented high price. However, sales have turned stagnant due to the high price, so the market price is 40 taels, and traders are still watching. However, given the scarcity of future goods, it may be possible to push prices higher.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Pi Tou: Intense Search and Purchase by Tianjin Groups <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The Pi market was particularly good yesterday. Tianjin groups were searching and purchasing extensively, resulting in very good sentiment. Zhigong呢 from the lower body rose by 0.005 tael. Si Junzi without a pass has opened at 0.315 yuan. The Three Friends picture spot goods have a tendency to become empty. The increase in the price of Fine Biji is also sharp. The First Class has been completely searched for by Tianjin groups, selling for 0.335 yuan. The Three Friends picture miscellaneous colors opened 50 pieces, for 0.3325 yuan.

Tianjin groups are very interested in purchasing. Zhu Hu has been sold out at 0.3 yuan, Luyingting is 0.315 yuan, Magu is 0.31 yuan, and Magpie Bridge Meeting is 0.32 yuan. The Three Friends Yuan Fine Biji also saw a great turnaround yesterday. Tianjin groups have already moved, so 0.315 yuan is needed. However, this street, due to its adherence to habit, is showing signs of ending the old year during this abolition of the lunar calendar, so there are not many transactions. Fine cloth continues to rise. Shuang Longzhu collapse households are searching very diligently, and yesterday it already required 7.55 taels. Shile Bird is 8.575 taels. Among Western goods, Fang Li Zhigong呢 is the most popular, and there are still few spot goods available at 0.31 yuan. There are more goods available for Tiaozi Banling at 0.275 yuan. Bleached cloth has hardened again.</p>

<p>Hardware transactions have been very quiet recently, so in the entire city, except for a few popular colors, such as French-style nails, water-resistant cement, new lead wire, checker copper, and tinplate, which have seen some negotiation and transactions, there are few buyers for other goods. However, prices are exceptionally firm amid the current surge in gold prices. Even with the declining sales of goods such as black iron sheet and green wire cloth, there is a situation of holding on. Regarding arrivals, yesterday over 2,000 bundles of 3x6 foot black iron sheet arrived, so there is little risk of falling prices in the market for a while. Other items such as large British steel plates, Dongbai iron, and old iron have also arrived in small quantities.</p>

<h3 id="e110">Business Tax Rates in Various Provinces <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>If They Exceed Regulations</p>
<p>They Should Be Revised Separately</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance Replies to Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Telegram</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce previously telegraphed the Ministry of Finance on the 29th of last month, stating that the business tax rates set by various provinces mostly exceeded the limitations of the guidelines issued by the Ministry, and specially requested that the Ministry of Finance strictly revise them during the review. It is now reported that the Chamber received a reply telegram from the Ministry of Finance yesterday, saying: "To the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, your telegram of the 29th is noted. Regarding the implementation of business taxes in various provinces and cities, if the proposed tax rates and collection methods for business classifications exceed the regulations of the outline and supplementary measures set by the Ministry, the Ministry will review and revise them separately when the province submits them for record, in order to comply with the original plan. As for business circles in various provinces, if they wish to participate with their opinions in advance, they can directly submit them to the competent authorities for approval. This is a special reply. Ministry of Finance."</p>
<h3 id="e111">Research Committee on Tax Regulations for Various Industries Writes Important Documents on Business Tax <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>▲Submitting Statements</p>
<p>The Research Committee on Tax Regulations for Various Industries of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday submitted a letter to Minister Song on the issue of business tax, and also sent letters to accountants Pan Xulun and Xu Yongzuo, submitting statements. The original letter is as follows:</p>
<p>▲Letter to Minister Song: "To Minister, the Committee previously determined that the business tax rates stipulated by Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces were too high, and the business community found it difficult to bear the burden, with Shanghai being the most affected. Representatives were dispatched to submit petitions, but as you were unwell, we were unable to meet you. We left the petition for your review, hoping you will examine it. The Likin system is harmful to merchants and detrimental to the country. You, with the greatest determination, demolished and cleared it. The people are benefiting, and it is the glory of the Party and the country. However, after abolishing Likin, it is necessary to find compensatory measures. The way to compensate is to increase taxes, so abolishing Likin and increasing taxes has become a consistent and related term for decades. This year, Likin was abolished and tariffs were increased simultaneously. Short-term gains were used to compensate for losses, and with the revenue from consolidated taxes, there is no need to worry about shortages. The so-called business tax is only used to compensate for the additional tax losses of various provinces after the abolition of Likin, and it must not be assumed that the entire Likin revenue of various provinces should be compensated by the business tax. This is evidenced by the speech of legislator Ma Yinchu at the Shanghai Party Headquarters, stating that Zhejiang province lost 1.4 million yuan after abolishing Likin, and is further evidenced by your approval to subsidize the administrative expenses of Hunan, Hubei, Henan, and Jiangxi provinces with monthly payments ranging from 300,000 to 100,000 yuan. However, the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have not paid attention to this point, and they have misunderstood the object. Therefore, the provincial financial authorities feel the hardship of having no rice to cook, and the tax rates are feared to be too low, while the merchants in the two provinces are panicked and running around, as stated in the joint telegram of the sixty chambers of commerce in Jiangsu and Zhejiang: 'We have just celebrated the abolition of Likin, and we are now subjected to harsh taxes.' The melons of the Yellow Terrace, how can they be picked again? Going further, the financial authorities of the two provinces, coming from the people, also know the hardships of the merchants, but they have to do so because the province must have administration, and administration requires expenses. What they silently understand in their hearts, but cannot express in words, is that the central government is being generous at the expense of the provinces, completely removing the financial resources of the local areas, and greatly increasing the revenue of the central government. Furthermore, some even informally tell the merchants this, so the merchants shift their blame from the inappropriateness of the tax rates stipulated by the two provinces to resentment towards the central government. In fact, the central government is determined to abolish Likin, and its grace is deeply rooted in the people. The promulgation of the business tax guidelines and supplementary measures is also well-defined and comprehensive. The only misunderstanding is that there is no clear regulation on the Likin losses that various provinces should compensate with the business tax. The Committee intends to request you to quickly order the relevant departments to clearly announce the amount of additional tax lost by each province and city due to the abolition of Likin, and to simultaneously notify each province and city to still base their drafting of business tax rates on the guidelines issued by the Yuan and the supplementary measures restrictions, to compensate for the inadequacy of the additional tax. Furthermore, please ask the central government to allocate funds to subsidize the provinces. As for the Likin regular tax, it will be compensated by the increased tariffs and the consolidated and special taxes. The provincial and municipal financial authorities need not worry too much about it. If this decree is issued this morning, we will see cheers thunderous, and the virtue of the Party-State and you will be forever engraved in our hearts. In addition, on the 3rd of this month, the newspaper reported your remarks, saying that the business tax rates of 2/1000 and 20/1000 are all extremely low tax rates. Considering your original intention, it is assumed that you consider extremely low tax rates to be compared to those in Europe and America. However, in terms of production, China is an extremely low-production country. In terms of people's lives, 99% of the Chinese people cannot even achieve an extremely low standard of living. It is obvious that extremely low tax rates must be levied on a country with extremely low production and a population with extremely low living standards. However, Article 4 of the Executive Yuan's Guidelines for the Collection of Business Tax in Various Provinces states that the tax rate for those levied on business turnover shall not exceed 2/1000. Article 8 of the Supplementary Measures states that the tax rate for those levied on capital shall not exceed 20/1000. What you call an extremely low tax rate is a comparison between China and other countries. The guidelines and supplementary measures, the so-called 'shall not exceed' and 'shall not exceed' are to limit the highest burden standard for the population with extremely low standards of living in an extremely low production country. Currently, the number of industries collecting business tax in Zhejiang province is eleven, and the number of industries collecting business tax in Jiangsu province is sixteen. Among the eleven and sixteen industries, only food, firewood, coal, and salt in the sales industry are taxed at 1/1000, while the rest are all above 2/1000. It is almost as if they recognize the highest limit previously stipulated by the Executive Yuan as the lowest limit. A slight difference leads to a great error, as the saying goes. Therefore, we must implore you to strictly correct them when reviewing the tax rates of the two provinces. Paying taxes is an obligation that the people should fulfill, but the level of tax rates is related to the national economy and the people's livelihood. The Committee has always admired your clear understanding and dares to present its humble opinions, respectfully requesting your adoption. We are fortunate and fortunate. We respectfully salute you."</p>
<p>▲Letter to Accountants Xulun and Yongzuo: "To Mr. Xulun Yongzuo, I have often heard that a country has its own special environment, and thus has its own special thoughts. It is impossible to transplant an entire academic theory to countries with different lifestyles. In terms of the current state of living, European and American countries have the highest production and the highest standards of living, while Japan has the highest production and a higher standard of living. China, on the other hand, has the lowest production, and the people cannot even achieve the lowest standard of living. This is evidenced by the increasing number of liquidations and the frequent bankruptcies when you and others perform accountant duties in Shanghai. The burden on the people is directly proportional to their production capacity and living conditions. If we must impose on the Chinese people the same amount of taxes that European, American, and Japanese people bear, wouldn't that be driving them to their deaths? Similarly, the public expenses for Chinese accountants handling cases cannot be compared with those of European and American accountants. This simple example is enough to prove it. We have heard that when Zhejiang province discussed business tax rates, a certain expert attended and said every day, 'This industry's tax rate is already low, and foreign countries should collect so much.' His intention seems to be that the Chinese business tax rates may as well follow the rates set by other countries, and there is no need to deliberate independently. Not only has he failed to give the slightest consideration to the declining state of Chinese industry and commerce and the exhaustion of the social economy, but he has also violated the Executive Yuan's guidelines on the business tax in various provinces. Does he have to see each industry go bankrupt and each store close down before he is happy? If you want to eat chicken eggs, you must cultivate the chicken itself. Killing the chicken for a momentary pleasure is not the economic policy that the country should adopt. Currently, Jiangsu's business tax rates are based on Zhejiang's rates, and the appeals of the sixty chambers of commerce in Jiangsu are indirectly due to the gift of a certain expert. The Shanghai business tax plan is currently being drafted and prepared by the Municipal Finance Bureau, and you are all members of the Finance Discussion Committee of the Municipal Finance Bureau. Since Jiangsu and Zhejiang have already erred in the past, this city must prevent it from repeating the same mistake. We are therefore offering this sincere advice and asking you to pay attention. A bone in the throat, it is good to spit it out. Offending words may be good medicine, and we hope you will take it to heart. We sincerely hope so. We wish you good health."</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Business Tax Collection Outline and Implementation Rules have been passed by the Municipal Finance Discussion Committee.

<h3 id="e113">Rice Merchants Discuss Business Tax Issues <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>The Rice Merchants Association of this city held an executive committee meeting yesterday afternoon, attended by more than a dozen people. Chairman Xu Jingzhi presided over the meeting to discuss the issue of business tax. The gist of the discussion was that since the central government promulgated the business tax, various provinces have formulated business tax regulations and are preparing to start collecting the tax. The tax rates in some provinces even exceed the central government's prescribed standard of two per thousand or twenty per thousand. Currently, various industries in this city are striving to negotiate, and a tax regulations research committee has been organized by various industries to specifically discuss this issue. However, the commodities of this industry must go through the procedures of traveling merchants, etc., before reaching the retailers. If a business tax of two per thousand has to be paid every time a traveling merchant is involved, the burden will inevitably increase sharply, and the price of rice will also inevitably rise, which will have a significant impact on the people's food supply. It has now been decided to hold another meeting to discuss the matter after the tax regulations research committee has made a definite statement.</p>

<p>▲ Yuan Liang Resigns and Prepares for Handover</p>
<p>▲ Chen Xizeng is Selected as the Successor</p>
<p>Yuan Liang, Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, recently received an order from the National Government to go to Japan to study police administration. Yuan Liang has submitted his resignation from the position of Director of the Public Security Bureau to the Municipal Government. The reporter from Nisshin Shimbun visited Yuan at the Public Security Bureau yesterday to inquire about the details of his resignation, the date of his departure to Japan, and the successor to the position of Director. Yuan provided a detailed answer. The conversation is recorded as follows: (Reporter's question) I recently heard that you have been ordered to go to Japan. Is this true? (Yuan's answer) I received an order from the National Government a few days ago to go to Japan to study police administration. Mayor Zhang also instructed me to study municipal administration. This is an order from the National Government, so I submitted my resignation from the position of Director of the Public Security Bureau to the Municipal Government yesterday. (Question) Has the date of departure to Japan been determined? (Answer) Since I took office as Director of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau on May 16, 1929, it has only been twenty months. However, because Shanghai is a corner where people from all directions gather, public security matters are of great importance, and I have been striving to do my best day and night, and I am fortunate to have made no mistakes. However, I feel that my energy has been deeply exhausted. I suffered from hemoptysis a month ago, which was slightly relieved after treatment. However, it suddenly recurred the day before yesterday. Therefore, after this resignation, I plan to rest for a month before deciding on my next move. I also plan to go to Beijing in the next few days to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and personally explain my intention. (Question) Have you heard anything about the successor? (Answer) I heard that Chen Xizeng, the current Director of the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau, will succeed to the position of Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. (Question) Are you ready to hand over? (Answer) I am now preparing to hand over. At this point, the reporter saw that Yuan had many visitors, so he excused himself and left. According to reports, Chen Xizeng, Director of the Telegraph Bureau, went to Beijing one day and returned to Shanghai yesterday morning.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Sun Baoqi Dies in Shanghai Residence <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>▲ Passed Away at 10:15 Last Night</p>
<p>▲ Twenty-One Children Attending</p>
<p>Former Prime Minister Sun Baoqi had been living in Shanghai since retiring. He suffered from a gastrointestinal disorder last winter, and after treatment by a Western doctor, it would sometimes improve and sometimes worsen. Two months ago, his condition suddenly worsened, and he also suffered from diarrhea. Treatment was ineffective, and he passed away at 10:15 last night, at the age of sixty-four.</p>
<p>▲ Treatment Process: Sun had a history of gastrointestinal disorders. In October of last year, he went to the Sino-Western Sanatorium Hospital on Bausch Road for treatment. The French doctor at the hospital said that there were parasites in his large intestine and that treatment would not be effective unless the parasites were killed. So he used medicine and acupuncture for treatment. Unexpectedly, he developed diarrhea due to the strong reaction of the medicine and acupuncture, which caused chills and fever from time to time. He then used quinine to reduce the fever. Because of his old age and weak physique, he could not support it. He was hospitalized for two months, and his vitality was greatly damaged. He had no choice but to move back to his residence on Jessfield Road, where he changed to Chinese medicine doctors Wang Zhongqi and Xia Yingyun for treatment. They both used ginseng and antler tonic products, but they were also ineffective after taking them. The diarrhea was the same as before. He also asked German doctor Polo and Dr. Huang Zhong to see him, but they all said that his original energy was too weak, and there was no significant effect. By 8:00 last night, he had reached the most dangerous time, and he passed away at 10:15 last night.</p>
<p>▲ Family Situation: Sun has six sons and sixteen daughters. The eldest son, Yongshi, is currently the manager of the Sumitomo Bank. The second son, Yongzhen, is the Deputy Consul of the German Consulate in Hamburg. The rest are all studying at school. The youngest son is only eight years old. Except for the second son, Yongzhen, they were all attending to him. After his death last night, his family immediately telegraphed relatives and friends in Tianjin and other places to announce the news.</p>
<p>▲ Sun's Brief Biography: Sun Baoqi, also known as Muh Han, was from Hang County, Zhejiang. He was sixty-four years old. His father, Yijing, was a Hanlin scholar in the Southern Study and served in the Yuqing Palace, teaching Emperor Dezong. He rose to the position of Vice Minister of the Ministry of Revenue. Sun was admitted to the officialdom through privilege and assigned to the Ministry of Punishment as a principal. In the twenty-first year of Guangxu, he was transferred by Wang Wenshao, Governor-General of Zhili, to the Beiyang Commission as a Daotai. In the twenty-fourth year, he was recommended as a talented official and summoned by imperial decree. In the twenty-sixth year, he went to Xi'an to handle official telegrams for the Military Affairs Department. Two years later, he was appointed as envoy to France. After completing his term, he returned to China and was appointed Governor of Shuntian Prefecture. The following year, he was ordered to be envoy to Germany. The following year, he was appointed Deputy Director of the Jinpu Railway.</p>

<p>After returning to China, he was released as Governor of Shandong. In the third year of Xuantong, the people's army launched an uprising in Wuhan, and he retired due to illness. In the Republic of China, he served as Minister of Foreign Affairs and concurrently as Acting Prime Minister. He was then transferred to the position of President of the Audit Court. In the fifth year, he was transferred to head the Ministry of Finance, and then transferred to the position of Director of the Customs Administration. In the twelfth year, he served as Prime Minister. During Duan Qirui's administration, he was appointed as ambassador to Russia but did not take office. In the fifteenth year, he retired from Beijing. In the seventeenth year, he went south and lived in Shanghai. He had great ambitions when he was young. During the Sino-Japanese War, most people in the capital advocated war, but he held dissenting views and almost suffered misfortune. Later, as an envoy, he repeatedly submitted memorials to request the establishment of a constitution and the reform of politics. Modern diplomats are either his subordinates or his disciples. When Cao Kun was in power, he served as Prime Minister. Because he opposed the Gold Franc case, he firmly refused to countersign it, which was praised by the times. He served as Director of the Customs Administration for seven years, and he always prioritized the interests of merchants and did not regard accumulation as a skill. After thirty years in office, his official bag was empty, but he was never stingy with charitable causes and helping friends and relatives in need. He always lent to them. He was clean and honest, and both Chinese and foreigners admired him.</p>

<h3 id="e121">Two Jiang Ships Have Accidents <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The Yiping, a vessel of the Yiping American Jiejiang Company, was en route from Shanghai to Yichang this time. When it was about 140 Chinese miles from Hankou, the water level was very shallow. Six Yangtze River vessels had long stopped night navigation for fear of accidents. Unexpectedly, the Yiping sailed upstream this time, coinciding with a decrease in the water level. Local bandits, in order to rob passing merchant ships, secretly moved the navigation warning lights set up by the Customs in that area. The Yiping, unaware, mistakenly entered a shallow beach. The hull was stranded, but it managed to pull itself out. However, the bottom of the ship was damaged and could no longer sail upstream. It immediately unloaded its cargo and passengers and returned to Shanghai. After arriving in Shanghai yesterday, it has already entered the factory for repairs. The warning lights moved by the bandits have been moved back to their correct positions by the Xunhan Customs.</p>
<p>The Yuanjiang Maru, an upstream vessel of the Yuanjiang segment, of the Nisshin Company, travels the Yichang route. On the first of this month, the ship sailed from Hankou to Yichang. Seventy miles upstream of Hankou, in the Jiayu Tao area, the river water was sharply receding, and there were often moving reefs in that area. Since the communist disturbances, the setting of warning lights has often been lost. The Yuanjiang Maru actually hit a reef in Jiayu Tao. The bottom of the first cabin was breached, and river water rushed in. Since it was heavily loaded, the second cabin was also affected. The passengers were greatly alarmed, and the hull was in extreme danger, with a precipitous tendency to sink. Fortunately, the company's Dangyang Maru, en route from Hankou to Yichang, rushed to rescue after receiving the news. According to follow-up news obtained yesterday, the passengers of the Yuanjiang Maru have been transferred to the Dangyang vessel, and the cargo is completely submerged in water. The vessel has sunk into the river, five feet below the waterline. The situation is still extremely dangerous. If the water level rises by one foot, the Yuanjiang will sink and be lost. The Hankou branch of Nisshin Company has sent barges to rescue the ship and has requested Japanese warships to sail to protect it.</p>

<h3 id="e125">Shanghai-Ningbo Vessels Implement Increased Escort Teams <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>▲ Twenty-Two Constables per Vessel</p>
<p>▲ To Be Implemented on March 1</p>
<p>Shanghai-Ningbo vessels are discussing increasing the number of escort teams to prevent pirates, as previously reported in this newspaper. Now, this matter has been proposed by Sanbei and others, and the method has been drafted immediately. It has also been requested from the Songhu Garrison Command that constables be sent on board to serve as escort teams. It has been decided to implement it on March 1. The details of the method are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Name: China Merchants, Ningbo-Shaoxing, etc., have publicly recommended Yu Qiaqing from the Sanbei Company to draft the charter system for the escort team in order to increase the number of escorts early. Yesterday, Yu, together with the two bureaus, agreed that the escort team should be named the Shipping Self-Defense Corps. A draft of forty-eight articles of association was specially drafted to regulate the duties of the corps members. In Shanghai, it was decided to set up an office of the Shipping Self-Defense Corps to manage all the affairs of the corps soldiers on the Xinjing, Tianning, Xingning, and Xinning-Shaoxing ships.</p>
<p>▲ Troop Strength: It has been agreed that the Shipping Self-Defense Corps will have one commander, who will be used by Xinjing, Tianning, Xingning, etc. There will be two deputy commanders with a monthly salary of 40 yuan each, two squad leaders with a monthly salary of 25 yuan each, and twenty-two soldiers with a monthly salary of 20 yuan each. The above is the number of officers and soldiers used by one ship. Each vessel will be equipped with 36 handguns and 24 wooden shell guns. In total, the three vessels will have six squad leaders, sixty-six soldiers, one hundred and eight handguns, and seventy-two wooden shell guns. The companies will receive them from the Garrison Command. The uniforms are in the drafting stage.</p>
<p>▲ Responsibilities: Yesterday, the three companies, having had a meeting, stipulated the responsibilities of the commander, squad leaders, and soldiers. The commander is responsible for training and guiding all squad leaders and soldiers, and has the power to promote, demote, reward, and reprimand. The soldiers' responsibilities are to be assigned to guard the interior and exterior hatches of each vessel to prevent pickpocketing. If there are suspicious people, they will jointly inspect them with the captain and the Water Public Security Bureau. If military equipment, etc., is found, it will be sent to the commander for forwarding to the company and the government. Soldiers will be stationed in the captain's office, the accounting room, the engine room, and the upper and lower hatches. In case of fog or rain, the squad leaders must go to high places to watch. Each vessel will also have three plainclothes soldiers as spies, and one female inspector will be added to prevent bandits, etc., from mixing into the vessel as women.</p>
<p>▲ Implementation Draft: The draft has been prepared, and it has been decided to request the Garrison Command to transfer sixty-six constables off the ships. All military uniforms, salaries, and food will be supplied by the shipping bureau. The draft will be implemented after it is revised. Therefore, requesting soldiers to board the ships is scheduled for March 1.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Heavy Fog at Songkou Yesterday <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Forty River and Sea Vessels Unable to Enter Port</p>
<p>The fog in Shanghai yesterday was the worst in recent memory. All river and sea vessels of various companies were blocked outside Wusongkou, and no vessels arrived in Shanghai all day. This situation is the only in recent years. The reports are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ River and Sea Vessels All Blocked: Yesterday, the fog outside Wusongkou was even heavier than in Shanghai, and it did not disperse all day. Only the China Merchants' Xinjing and the Sanbei's Ningxing vessels, due to their regular Shanghai-Ningbo schedule, which could not be missed, ventured into the Huangpu River at 7:15 AM. They arrived at Wusongkou and anchored at 4:30 PM in the afternoon, waiting for the fog to clear before continuing. Other Yangtze River vessels of the Six Companies, such as Xinningxing, Anqing, and Wusong, were anchored at the mouth of the Yangtze River to avoid the fog. Some, scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the morning of the 2nd, have still not been able to arrive. Sanbei Company's new vessel, Sanbei, also had its propeller damaged. Yesterday, the Six Companies, seeing that no vessels had arrived, sent out wireless telegrams to inquire. They said that the sea was a vast expanse, and it was impossible to distinguish the waterways and incoming vessels, so they dared not travel. If the fog can disperse today, they can come, they said. Coastal vessels, such as Jardine Matheson's Shun Tien of the Northern Line, Ewo's Guisheng, Dalian's Dalianxiao, and Nanyang Line's Niuzhuang and Shandong, Great Britain's mail steamer Melville, and Italian mail steamer Venizelos, etc., were all blocked beyond Sanjia Shui. Three cargo vessels from the Pacific Ocean were also blocked and could not enter. Jardine Matheson's tugboats went to tow them several times, but they returned to Shanghai because they could not distinguish the routes. As a result, not a single river or sea vessel entered the port yesterday, a rare occurrence.</p>
<p>▲ Huangpu River Surface Guarded: After 5:00 PM yesterday, the surface of the Huangpu River was already misty, as if in smoke, and it was impossible to distinguish anything at a short distance. All of the companies' small ferry boats across the river stopped operating half an hour earlier. The civil boats and cargo barges in the river also docked early and stopped working. From 6:00, no ships were traveling on the river. The British and French warships on the surface of the Jingjiang River outside the sea, fearing that other ships might collide with them, implemented a guard. They rang a warning bell every minute and sounded a foghorn every three minutes. The sound of "woo-woo" and the ringing of bells all sounded together for a while. It was also heard that Changxing Company's Empress of Canada, originally scheduled to leave for Hong Kong on the 5th, was delayed to Shanghai by one day due to the fog, so it was rescheduled to leave the port on the 6th.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Zhu Xiaochun Assault Case: Municipal Government to Lodge Protest <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>According to Guodi News Agency, since Zhu Xiaochun was arrested and severely beaten, a serious injury has appeared on his head. Furthermore, being detained overnight in the cold of the police station has affected his lungs, causing him to cough frequently. Therefore, upon regaining his freedom, he immediately went to the Shēnjiāng Hospital in the French Concession for a medical examination. Dr. Liu Zhigang, the hospital's director, confirmed that he was indeed injured by a blunt instrument, pointing out four areas of injury. Fortunately, after undergoing surgery and taking medicine, his injuries are said to be fully recovered, but the cough has not yet subsided. At that time, after Zhu was declared innocent by the Special District Court, he submitted petitions to the Party and government authorities for serious negotiations. It is learned that, in addition to the municipal government's inquiry, the Secretariat of the Municipal Party Headquarters also sent a letter to Zhu yesterday, stating: "Respectfully, we acknowledge receipt of your previous petition reporting the unwarranted assault by the British police and the unjustified detention by the police station. The case has been submitted to the municipal government for negotiation. We have now received Public Letter No. 2380, which states that while the matter is under investigation, Zhu Xiaochun has submitted a similar petition. In addition to lodging a serious protest with the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession, we are informing you accordingly. Please take note of the matter."</p>
<h3 id="e128">Postal Workers Demand Housing Allowance <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>▲ Representative Assembly Held Yesterday to Discuss</p>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union held a meeting the day before yesterday to discuss the issue of housing allowances, among other matters, and resolved to negotiate with the authorities. At 9:00 AM yesterday, the union dispatched representatives Zhang Kechang, Lu Jingshi, Zhu Xuefan, Qi Jiamou, Meng Shuxiu, and others, nine in total, to the General Post Office to submit a petition in person. At that time, the new Director-General, Qian Chunqi, was in Beijing and had not yet returned. Secretary Yang Sili came out to meet them, explaining that Director-General Qian had not yet returned and could only temporarily accept the petition for forwarding upon his return tomorrow (i.e., today). The representatives, having failed to achieve their objective, returned together. Yesterday afternoon, the union held a representative assembly to plan response strategies and discuss issues such as collective exemption from income tax and management of the fund. The Guowen News Agency reporter then met with Zhang Kechang, the executive member of the union, and the conversation was as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Zhang stated, in brief, that housing allowances were already in place in places like Beijing, Tianjin, Jinan, Harbin, and Nanjing. In Shanghai, only the Second Transportation Division had it, while other staff were still in the process. Today, we went directly to the bureau to request an audience with Director-General Qian, intending to submit a petition in person to him. To our surprise, Director-General Qian had gone to Beijing and had not yet returned, but he is expected to return tomorrow (i.e., today), at which point we will make the request again. Furthermore, the petition has already stated that a response must be given within ten days from today. Therefore, we expect a solution upon Director-General Qian's return to Shanghai. As for future action plans and strategies to be adopted in the event of necessity, these will all be determined at today's assembly.</p>
<p>▲ Main Points of the Petition Yesterday, the nine representatives of the union went to the General Post Office to submit a petition. The main points of the petition stated that, as the cost of living is rising daily, renting a house in the concessions costs several tens of dollars per month. While housing in remote areas is cheaper, the cost of transportation is also considerable. Employees who earn only a few tens of dollars a month are already struggling to afford housing alone. Therefore, we earnestly request that the authorities provide a monthly allowance of ten dollars to all levels of staff below postal officers. Furthermore, the housing allowance has been in place in the capital for many years. In other places like Pingjin, Ji, and Ha, in addition to housing allowances, there are also coal allowances. Therefore, Shanghai would not be the first to implement this. Even postal directors, who have relatively high salaries, have housing rents of over a hundred dollars paid for entirely by the bureau. Compared to employees who earn only a few tens of dollars a month, it is even more difficult to make ends meet.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Sino-American Joint Venture in Shipping <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>▲ Terms Not Yet Agreed Upon by Both Parties</p>
<p>▲ Li Zhonggong Has Gone to Beijing to Negotiate</p>
<p>It has been widely rumored recently that China and the United States will jointly operate Chinese shipping, which was initiated by Mr. Dollar, the owner of the American Dollar Steamship Company. During his last visit to Shanghai, Mr. Dollar proposed conditions to Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting, which were that the ships would be provided by the Dollar Company, and the shipping operations would also be managed by them, but under the Chinese flag. The company would pay a certain percentage of the profits to the Chinese government, and the company would register with the Chinese authorities and be supervised by the Chinese Shipping Administration. The company's headquarters would be located in Shanghai, initially operating routes between Shanghai and Hankou, Shanghai and Ningbo, Shanghai and Fuzhou, and Shanghai and Tianjin, etc. After receiving the proposal, Foreign Minister Wang forwarded it to Minister of Communications Wang Boqun. Minister Wang expressed disagreement with several points and advocated operating based on the model of the China National Aviation Corporation. Minister Wang's response to Mr. Dollar was that the National Government's policy was to accept the management of all ships, utilizing American capital to develop Chinese shipping. The Dollar Company could lend money to China to develop shipping. The loan would be repaid over a period of fifteen years, and the National Government would control personnel and administration for shipping operations. In addition to inland and coastal routes, overseas routes should also be established, etc. The Dollar Company has not yet responded. Li Zhonggong, the Director-General of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, has now gone to Beijing to negotiate the matter. Last Sunday, when Minister Wang was in Shanghai, reporters also asked him about this matter. Minister Wang replied that China is currently negotiating the recovery of navigation rights. The purpose of the Sino-American joint operation of shipping is to prepare for the development of Chinese shipping after the recovery of navigation rights. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and shipping experts are currently studying the matter.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Yesterday's News on Sino-German Aviation <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>

Two of these aircraft are en route from Germany to Shanghai and are expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 12th of this month. The fifteen pilots and navigators hired are all German nationals and are also expected to arrive in Shanghai soon.

A trial flight can only take place after the installation is complete. Therefore, the airline has not yet been able to determine the date of the trial flight, and there is even less certainty about when it can officially launch.</p>

<h3 id="e134">Henan Chairman Liu Sends Urgent Telegram Pleading for Disaster Relief <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Red Cross Society yesterday received a telegram from Liu Zhi, Chairman of the Henan Provincial Government, pleading for disaster relief. The plea was earnest and unbearable to hear. It is urgently disclosed as follows: "Received telegram from Zhang Fang, Director of the Henan Civil Affairs Department, from Luoyang, stating that he had met with various county magistrates along the way, who all reported a severe shortage of grain and funds, leading to a rise in banditry. He passed through Xin'an, Mianchi, and Xia County, where the poor were impoverished and without food, and even the rich were crying out in hunger and cold, a truly pitiful sight. The army has money but cannot buy rice. We earnestly request that you instruct the relief association to first implement price controls to alleviate the immediate crisis. If that is not immediately feasible, please negotiate with the Railway Bureau to prepare a train to transport grain, thereby rescuing the remnants of the people. We also request that you promptly send telegrams to the National Government and various charitable organizations to raise relief funds, so that dying disaster victims may receive assistance. We await your response with utmost anticipation." It has been investigated that Henan Province has suffered deeply from natural disasters and war. We have previously sent telegrams to various charitable organizations to solicit funds for assistance and also telegraphed the Central Government to request a disbursement of 100,000 yuan for direct disbursement of urgent relief in areas affected by the war. However, a cup of water is insufficient to extinguish a burning cart of firewood. As winter approaches, the cold and hunger are compounding the suffering. Fundraising in various places is limited, and it is difficult to implement price controls. The sight of misery everywhere is truly pitiable. In addition to telegraphing the Central Government to continue allocating relief funds, we also ask that you have compassion for the remnants of the people and solicit relief funds to be remitted continuously. We await your response with utmost anticipation." Liu Zhi, Chairman of the Henan Provincial Government.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Relief Society yesterday received the original letter from the relief delegation sent by the Shaanxi Branch, as follows: "Investigated the severe disaster situation in Shaanxi Province, the miserable conditions are evident. Winter and spring relief needs to be prepared early to save the remnants of the people. We hereby send Mr. Li Runzhi as a representative of our society to appeal to the Shanghai-Nanjing area, and we hope to provide guidance when the time comes." According to Mr. Li, although there was some planting in the province in the autumn, it was all damaged by insects, resulting in no harvest. More people are starving to death. Refugees in the countryside are not only demolishing houses and selling them as firewood, but also transporting farm tools and stone mills from hundreds of miles away to sell in the city. In this snowy and icy weather, without clothes or food and homeless, if rescue is not provided in time, another tragedy of starvation will occur. Not only is winter relief urgently needed, but spring relief must also be prepared early, as farm tools have been lost and seeds are lacking, making cultivation even more difficult. We hope that all parties will act with compassion and rescue these remaining people as soon as possible, so that the people of Qin will not all be buried in ditches, etc." It is heard that the society is also deeply anxious due to a shortage of funds.</p>

<h3 id="e150">Russian Accused of Gambling and Embezzlement <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>The president of the Russian Military Society at 91 Route Tenant de la Tour, Gao Lai Si Re Gao Fu, and attorney Yan Qiu Fen Ling, have filed a lawsuit in the Special District Court against Shu Hai Ying Peng and Fan Che Lin, accusing them of gambling and embezzlement. They request legal punishment and an order for compensation for losses through civil suit. The defendants have retained attorney Wei Wen Han to file a defense and counterclaim. The case was heard in the third court by Judge Feng Shi De on January 26th. However, due to the absence of the first defendant, Ai Hai Ying Peng, the hearing was postponed to February 2nd. On February 2nd, the case was heard by Cheng Shang Feng, but Judge Cheng had many other cases, resulting in insufficient time. The hearing was then rescheduled for yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. The details of the hearing and the defendant's defense are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲ Gao Lai Si Re Gao Fu's Testimony</p>
<p>At 3:30 PM, after Cheng Shang Feng took his seat in court, he first questioned Gao, who described the embezzlement by the defendants and the operation of a gambling den at the Russian Military Society at 91 Route Tenant de la Tour. The testimony was generally the same as the previously published complaint, so details are omitted. After the testimony, the judge asked: "In February 1930, you sent a letter to Fan Ban Lin, stating that the club had no relationship with you. Is the signature at the end of the letter your own?" Gao replied, "It seems like it was my signature." The judge asked again to be sure, and Gao replied, "It was my signature." The judge asked, "Is your secretary Hua Gen Song?" Gao replied, "Yes." The judge asked, "On November 22, 1930, the first defendant, Ai Hai Ying Peng, sent you a letter. Is that correct?" (The original letter was presented to Gao for review). After reviewing the letter, Gao replied, "That's correct." The judge asked, "The first defendant's letter stated that the club's business was not good and that they were planning to close it down after January. Is that correct?" Gao replied, "Because we were planning to buy a portion of Bao Men's shares, that's why he wrote that letter." The judge asked, "But you wrote back to him, telling him not to resign. Did you write that letter yourself?" Gao replied, "I wrote the letter." The judge asked, "Did the defendants later write to you again, saying that they were definitely not going to continue? Was there such a letter?" Gao replied, "Yes, there was." The judge then summoned Gao's secretary, Hua Gen Song, for questioning. Hua testified that he was a 35-year-old Russian and worked as a clerk for the plaintiff. The judge said to Hua, "You must tell the truth about what you are asked in court. If you lie, you will be punished." Hua replied, "Yes." The judge asked, "Did you write the letter that the plaintiff sent back to the defendants?" Hua replied, "Yes." The judge asked, "Did the plaintiff sign his name himself?" Hua replied, "He signed it." At this point, the defendant's lawyer, Wei Wen Han, stood up and asked Judge Cheng to ask the plaintiff what he meant by the first article of the contract signed on July 24, 1929. Judge Cheng immediately asked the plaintiff, and the plaintiff replied, "The first article roughly states that Bao Men and Luo Men Si Ke Wei Qu each receive half."</p>
<p>▲ Ai Hai Ying Peng's Testimony</p>
<p>The judge asked, "What do you do for the plaintiff?" Ai replied, "I am the manager." The judge asked, "Do you have shares in the club?" Ai replied, "He is the president and manages the members' affairs. I am the manager and manage the club's affairs. I also have no shares." The judge asked, "Do you gamble and skim profits in the club every day?" Ai replied, "Our club is the same as other clubs. We read newspapers and sometimes gamble a little." The judge asked, "Does the plaintiff often write letters to you, telling you not to gamble?" Ai replied, "On October 22nd of last year, we sent a letter to the plaintiff, stating that we were quitting." The judge asked, "Did the plaintiff send letters to you, telling you not to gamble?" Ai replied, "Yes, he did." The judge asked, "Then how many letters were there in total?" Ai replied, "About one or two letters in December." The judge asked, "You filed a complaint against the plaintiff at the Zhabei Police Station. Why?" Ai replied, "He threatened me with a gun, so I reported it to the Zhabei Police Station." The judge asked, "When?" Ai replied, "December 30th." The judge asked, "Did you go with them?" Ai replied, "Yes, I went with them." The judge asked, "How much time elapsed between the plaintiff threatening you with a gun and you reporting it to the police station?" Ai replied, "I reported it the next day." The judge asked, "Is the gun found by the police station the same one that the plaintiff used to threaten you?" Ai replied, "Yes, it is." The judge did not believe him and asked to send someone to investigate. The judge asked, "Who is currently keeping the club's furniture?" Ai replied, "It is entrusted to a French store for safekeeping."</p>
<p>▲ Fan Che Lin's Testimony</p>
<p>The judge asked, "What do you do?" Fan replied, "Nothing." The judge asked, "Did you put any money into the club?" Fan replied, "No." The judge asked, "The plaintiff said you are the 'face' and Ai Hai Ying Peng is the 'insider,' is that correct?" Fan replied, "That's not correct." The judge asked, "Do you often go to the club?" Fan replied, "I haven't been there for four or five months." The judge asked, "Aren't you always going there to gamble?" Fan replied, "I used to go there often, but I haven't been there for the past four or five months." The judge asked, "Do you have a share in the current furniture?" Fan replied, "I don't have a share. I only acted as a guarantor on the contract, and I have no other relationship."</p>
<p>▲ Debate Scheduled for Today</p>
<p>Lawyer Wei stood up and said, "May I ask the court, can a final verdict be announced today? If a final verdict can be announced, the defendant is willing to withdraw the counterclaim. If the hearing is postponed, the counterclaim will not be withdrawn." Judge Cheng then announced that the debate would begin at 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 4th. Lawyer Wei immediately stated that the counterclaim would not be withdrawn.</p>
<p>▲ The Plaintiff's Sorrowful Words</p>
<p>At this point in the hearing, the plaintiff requested permission from the judge to present a statement. The judge granted permission. The plaintiff then said, "I was a high-ranking military officer before the Russian Revolution. Now I am living in your country as a stateless national. I can only request that the judges of your country conduct a fair trial." After making this statement, Judge Cheng said, "The theoretical aspects can be discussed during tomorrow's debate. There is not enough time now," and then adjourned the court.</p>
<p>▲ The Defendants' Defense</p>
<p>The defense statement argues that the accusations are fabricated and requests a legal defense and counterclaim. The first defendant leased No. 8 Tongfu Road as the Russian Naval Club. All the furniture and equipment belong to Min Yu Ge Le, who bought it from Luo Men Si Ke Wei Qu, who bought it from Bao Men. There are contracts to prove this, and the plaintiff is one of the witnesses and cannot deny this. The first defendant has not embezzled anything. Furthermore, Lawyer Qiu Fen Ling previously sent a letter on behalf of the plaintiff, requesting that he have the right of first refusal when Bao Men leaves the club. This alone proves that the plaintiff fabricated the facts and made false accusations. As for gambling, that place is a club and should have appropriate entertainment. However, there has never been any gambling. The so-called appropriate entertainment is all stated in the contract. The plaintiff's fabricated accusations are surprising. Furthermore, the house belongs to the Terry firm, and the lease has now expired. It has been leased to a French firm, Shi Lai, for a monthly rent of 660 taels for a term of one year. The second defendant is only the guarantor for the first defendant and has no connection to the club. Based on the above facts, the plaintiff has committed a crime under Article 180 of the Criminal Law and is therefore submitting a defense and counterclaim, respectfully requesting that the court conduct a trial and deliver a verdict according to the law to prevent false accusations. Submitted to the Shanghai Special District Court.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Tang Hui Xuan's Case Against Wife Dismissed <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>▲ Tang Also Submits a Request to Withdraw the Complaint</p>
<p>Tang Hui Xuan, an American economics PhD, accused his wife of adultery with Chen Gen Wei, causing a sensation in Shanghai. His wife, Zou Ai Zhen, retained law PhD Zheng Yu Xiu as her defense lawyer. The previous newspapers have reported this. The court found that Tang's procedures did not comply with the Criminal Procedure Law and transferred the entire case file to the prosecutor's office. The chief prosecutor, Liu Mao Chu (who holds a French law PhD), thoroughly examined it and found many flaws, which he refuted. The prosecutor's decision is thousands of words long and should be noted by society. Excerpts are provided below:</p>
<p>▲ Decision of Non-Prosecution</p>
<p>Defendant Zou Ai Zhen, female, 26 years old, from Shanghai. Defendant Chen Gen Wei, male, 29 years old, from Shanghai. The above defendants are involved in case No. 288 of the criminal code of the Republic of China, concerning offenses against marriage. After a thorough investigation, this court believes that a decision of non-prosecution should be made. The facts and reasons are stated as follows: "Facts" Tang Hui Xuan, also known as Tang Chong Ci and Shi An, accused his wife Zou Ai Zhen of adultery with Chen Gen Wei. Because the first instance declared them not guilty, he appealed to the collegial panel of this court. The second instance reversed the original judgment, rejected the plaintiff's complaint in the first instance, and notified the prosecutor to investigate according to Article 343 of the Criminal Law. Reviewing the original case file, the plaintiff stated that he returned to the country in the 16th year of the Republic of China and resided with the first defendant at his mother's house, and they had two children. He also stated, "My wife often goes out with Chen Gen Wei. She is now engaging in various improper behaviors, which my friends have noticed and urged me to return. So I came back on August 9th. My wife took me to the kiosk to live and did not share the bed with me. On the 10th, she told me that she did not want to live with me. On the 12th, I moved out. On August 13th, I went to my mother-in-law's house, and my wife had already left. I asked the nanny, Zhou A Mei, who Ai Zhen usually sleeps with. She replied that Master Chen and my young mistress are husband and wife. They sleep in the same bed every day and live in the back parlor upstairs. When I heard this, I immediately told the nanny that I am the mistress's husband. Later, when I asked the nanny about what she said, she refused to say anything. Later, on the 16th, I went to my mother-in-law's house and saw Ai Zhen and Chen Gen Wei sleeping in the same bed. I immediately reported to the third division of the first district and brought two police officers with me to arrest them. It was 5:00 AM. I went upstairs to take a look first and then called the police to go up and pull them out. They were still fast asleep. Three of us went in. One was a plainclothes officer, one was a driver, and one was a friend of mine whose surname is Xu. I don't know his name. He is a friend of a friend. He was introduced by a friend. I don't know where he lives. He refuses to say where he lives. He works at the Public Security Bureau but refuses to come to court," etc.</p>
<p>During the appeal, he also said that he returned to the country in the 16th year of the Republic of China and lived at No. 2 Qiyun Lane, Da Nan Men. After Zou Ai Zhen returned to the country, she first lived at No. 2 Qiyun Lane and then moved to No. 890 Route Père Robert. Last year, she moved to her current residence at No. 821 Zhonghua Road, her mother's house. He also stated that he returned in the 16th year and lived with Ai Zhen for two months. He went to Hubei. In August of last year, a friend named Chen Pi Lan told me. Another friend, Zhai Yi Zhi, also told me, but he has already gone to Guangxi. These two came to my mother-in-law's house to find me and learned of the various actions. Another friend, Hu Hai Gu, saw the two of them riding in a car together. A foreigner, Bian Luo, saw Zou Ai Zhen without her pants on in a small room in the photography studio. He also said that they had not lived together since August 6th of last year. After I returned to Shanghai from Hankou, she refused me and told me to move to a hotel. Two weeks later, I went to Guangdong. On August 9th of this year, I returned from Hong Kong, and she refused to let me come back. Later, I stayed at her mother's house for one night and slept alone in the kiosk," etc. During the investigation by this office, Tang Hui Xuan stated that he returned from the United States in the 16th year and lived with Ai Zhen. In February of the 17th year, he first went to Nanjing and then to Hubei. I went to Hankou, and Ai Zhen also went with me. She stayed for three months. She returned to Shanghai because the children were sick. I lived in Hankou for eight months. In August of the 18th year, I returned to Shanghai and found Chen Wei Gen living in the house. Ai Zhen forced me to live in a hotel for two weeks. He also stated that when I was in Hubei, a friend wrote to me, saying that the two of them went out together. When I returned, I personally saw them flirting with each other. I said at the time that I could not stand this situation. At 6:00 AM on August 16th, I hired a car on the road and took two police officers, a friend surnamed Xu whose name is unknown, and a driver whose name is unknown, and pushed the door open. I went upstairs to take a look first and then came down to take the police officer He Feng Lin up. A friend also went up, and one police officer stayed downstairs. The driver also went up, I think. I directed the police officer to go in and arrest them. I stood at the door. They lived in the kiosk. The police officer only pulled the two of them up, etc. The main points of the first defendant's defense are roughly as follows: Because the plaintiff had syphilis, they had signed a written agreement to live in separate rooms for two years. This time, when he came back, he brought many women's belongings. On the 12th, they started talking about divorce, but I refused, etc. Combining the testimony of the second defendant and the first defendant's younger sister and stepmother, Zou Yu Shi, the second defendant was in the back parlor upstairs, and the first defendant was in the front parlor upstairs. The first defendant, his oldest child, and his stepmother slept on floor mats, and the youngest child slept in the bed. The younger sister, Yue Zhen, also slept on another floor mat. The three plainclothes officers first grabbed the second defendant and then went to grab Yue Zhen. The plaintiff said at the top of the stairs that she was not the woman. The first defendant heard the noise and got up to see what was going on and was arrested instead of Yue Zhen, etc. "Reasons" Based on the above facts, the actions of the defendants were either heard by the plaintiff or witnessed by the plaintiff. Some belonged to old matters, and some belonged to new evidence. In general, there are three main points: (1) the relationship between the defendants was too intimate; (2) what was heard about the incident at the photography studio; and (3) what was witnessed on the morning of August 16th. To clarify the truth, let us examine each point separately. A. The relationship between the defendants on weekdays. The second defendant lost his father at the age of six and was adopted by the first defendant's stepmother, Zou Yu Shi, at the age of twelve. He lost his mother at the age of fourteen. He lived in the Zou family, married a wife for two years, and after his wife died, he lived with his stepmother for another four years for convenience. Their relationship is in fact like that of a mother and son, which the plaintiff must have known. Therefore, the fact that the defendants went out together should not have started in the 18th year of the Republic of China. If merely talking and laughing with each other, lighting her cigarettes, and eating her leftover porridge are considered signs of impropriety, then men and women in all families must maintain strict distance from each other. However, this may not be the format of families after the European War. Moreover, according to the testimony of the stepmother, Zou Yu Shi, what kind of improper behavior did the second defendant show? Although the second defendant's nephew, Chen Zhen Han, voluntarily came to this office to testify that his character was not good, when asked what his relationship was, he said, "He owes me money." Therefore, his words are not credible. According to the plaintiff, his friends Chen Pi Lan and Zhai Yi Zhi came to his mother-in-law's house to find him and learned of the various actions. However, according to common sense, if the person is not at home, ordinary friends would rarely sit inside and chat. Improper actions would also not be done in front of any close friends. Moreover, the plaintiff cannot point out the addresses of Chen and Zhai, so it is clear that they are not accurate. On this point, one cannot help but think that the plaintiff is overly sensitive. B. The incident on March 31st of the 18th year. This matter was presented to the plaintiff by Bian Luo, a Czech technician at the Queen's Photography Studio, in the law office of Shi Ying after the complaint was filed. The plaintiff said that he met him for the first time at 4:00 PM on September 27th. The three of them talked about eating at Da Zhonghua on Sichuan Road. However, the letter from Lawyer Shi to Bian Luo was written on September 29th, so the testimonies do not match. Leaving that aside, there are many brothels along the Bund, so there are many opportunities for secret meetings. Why would the defendants go to a photography studio where someone they know lives upstairs? Even prostitutes on the street know to be discreet, so why would they open the door wide? Moreover, the defendants and Bian Luo are both shareholders of the photography studio. When foreigners address each other, they usually distinguish whether they are Mrs. So-and-so or Mr. So-and-so. Why would the defendant not know what kind of relationship he had and mistakenly assume they were husband and wife? Therefore, the testimonies of the Englishman, Ge Bi Te, and the Russian, A Ke Xi Si, that Bian Luo and the second defendant had a dispute over the store's accounts are more credible. This part should be considered unreasonable. C. The incident on August 16th of the 19th year. This is the main point of this case. According to the plaintiff, he stayed at his mother-in-law's house for one night this time. He learned about it on August 13th from the nanny, Zhou A Mei. However, since he was able to stay at the Zou family's house, the servant would definitely know what kind of relationship he had with the owner. The servant and maid have been there for two months, so they would definitely know whether this house is the Zou residence or the Chen residence. For secret messages, even if the servant is foolish, they would not casually say anything to guests. This is one suspicious point. Examining the entire case file closely, the plaintiff stated that he first saw the defendants sleeping in the same bed and then went out to call the police. In the appeal and complaint, he stated that he went to the police directly. The testimonies differ slightly. This is the second suspicious point. The plaintiff went to arrest the adulterers, which is a very serious matter, yet someone whose name is unknown followed to watch. Moreover, a friend who knew his surname but not his name and knew he worked at the Public Security Bureau but refused to say where he lived helped them. None of them could be invited to testify. This is the third suspicious point. As evidenced by the words of the servant Zhou A Mei and the police officer who arrested them on that day, Zhou A Mei did not admit to telling him anything and even said that they did not have an affair (see the appeal transcript of November 11th of the 19th year). As for the police officer, He Feng Lin, in two court hearings, he testified that he did not lay a hand on them and said, "On this day, I was on duty and saw a car. Tang Hui Xuan came out and said to me that he was going to arrest people. Later, he reported to the district chief and went with him. When entering the Zou family's door, the Tang surname called me to stand at the foot of the stairs. The Tang surname grabbed the two defendants and told me to take them to the bureau. The Tang surname told me not to enter the room, fearing that it would startle the defendants. So I stood at the foot of the stairs and did not enter the room. The three people who came with the Tang surname went to arrest them." Therefore, the defendants' criminal behavior cannot be proven. Based on the above conclusions, the defendants did not commit any crime. While preparing the official decision, the plaintiff submitted a request to withdraw the complaint. In accordance with Articles 244, Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a decision of non-prosecution is made as above.</p>

<p>▲ Lai Yi Ferry to Establish a Water Plant</p>
<p>▲ North Hu Tang to Open Artesian Well</p>
<p>The Pudong area of this city does not yet have tap water facilities. Residents have always drawn water from the Huangpu River for drinking, and the water flow is turbid and not hygienic. The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, recognizing the urgent need for tap water among the people there, has drafted a plan for a municipal Pudong water plant. It has been learned that the municipal government has decided to establish it and has approved an initial allocation of 80,000 yuan for the purchase of land and the ordering of machinery. The Public Utilities Bureau is consulting with the Land Bureau to purchase private land near the Lai Yi Ferry, You Long Pier, and Tao Yuan Zhai in Pudong for construction. The North Hu Tang of Lai Yi Ferry previously had foul-smelling water, and the Public Utilities Bureau designed and drilled an artesian well there, designating the open space north of No. 105 Lai Yi Ferry as the well site. This location is close to the proposed water plant site, so it may not be necessary to build it. However, the construction of the water plant will take at least one year to complete. For temporary relief, it is still necessary to drill another artesian well. It is reported that this plan has also been approved by the municipal government and is currently being actively carried out.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Declining Exchange Rate for Silver <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Recently, due to the extreme shortage of silver coins and copper coins on the market, the bulk price has been consistently increasing. Therefore, the exchange rate for silver dollars has gradually decreased. Yesterday morning, one silver dollar could still be exchanged for five double-horn silver coins (equivalent to ten horns) plus 150-160 cash coins. In the afternoon, it was only plus 120-130 cash coins. One silver dollar could be exchanged for 2,540-2,550 copper coins, which is 70-80 cash coins and 100 cash coins less than the exchange rate a week ago. It is said that in the coming week, the exchange rate may decline further, or silver coins may be exchanged for no change at all. The price of copper coins may fall below 2,500 cash coins or increase, which is still uncertain.</p>

<h3 id="e155">Record of the Interrogation of the Kidnappers in the Cai Fu Lin Case <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Cai Fu Lin, a comprador of the British American Tobacco Company from Pudong, was kidnapped twice and ransomed for 30,000 yuan each time. His first kidnapping occurred on March 14th of the 18th year of the Republic of China. The chief inspector of the Criminal Investigation Department of the General Police Station, Lu Lian Kui, and inspectors Tang Jian, Feng Zhi Ming, Liu Zhao Nian, Zhang Shao Qing, etc., have successively arrested the kidnappers Zhang Jin Sheng, Chen Xiang Long, Jin Cang Shou, Qiang Hong Xiang (also known as Zhang Hong Xiang), Wang Dao Shi (also known as Wang Xiao Gen), Zhang Jin Chun, Shao Ren Mei, the woman Zhang Qian Shi (Zhang Jin Sheng's wife), Chen Wu Shi (also known as Da A Jie, Chen Xiang Long's wife), etc., a total of nine people. The detailed circumstances are recorded below:</p>
<p>Cai Fu Lin lived at No. 56 Hede Road, Shanghai West. At 8:00 AM on March 14th of the 18th year of the Republic of China, Cai took his private chartered car to the office. While passing the corner of Hart Road and Avenue Haig, several kidnappers suddenly blocked the road, claiming to be sent by the tobacco tax bureau and asking Cai to go to the bureau to talk. They tied Cai up and put him in car No. 6746, which was parked by the roadside, and drove him to Route de Say Zoong in the French Concession, hiding Cai at No. 7, Lane 79. After about eight days, they moved him to No. 91 Zhou Jia Zui Road. On April 20th, he was ransomed for 30,000 yuan. After this case occurred, the police conducted a thorough investigation. Recently, Chief Inspector Lu Lian Kui and others found that this case was initiated by Chen Wu Shi, the wife of Cai Fu Lin's colleague Chen Xiang Long. She knew Cai and knew that his family was somewhat well-off. She secretly met with the kidnappers at the Da Dong Hotel and planned to kidnap Cai. Zhang Jin Sheng and Zhang Hong Xiang were in charge of guarding the hostage. Chen Xiang Long, Chen Wu Shi, Zhang Jin Sheng, and Zhang Hong Xiang were arrested. It was later found that Zhang Qian Shi was the one who delivered food to Cai every day, so she was also arrested. Later, Wang Dao Shi, the driver of the kidnappers' car, and Zhang Jin Chun, who wrote the ransom letter, were arrested. According to Chen Wu Shi, Jin Cang Shou was also involved in the scheme. Jin had been sentenced to five years in prison by the court on January 23rd of the 19th year for robbing a prostitute of her jewelry. Inspector Lu went to the Western Prison and brought Jin in for questioning. It was then learned that the license plate of car No. 6746 used by the kidnappers was fake. The real license plate number was 16746. The car was borrowed by Shao Ren Mei, a driver at the Mitsui Bank, to the kidnappers. Shao was also arrested and handed over to the Special District Court. Repeated interrogations were conducted, but because spectators were prohibited, it was impossible to record the details. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Ge Zhi Qin held a public hearing. The police lawyer, Wang Yao Tang, stated that the court had instructed the police to investigate the landlord of the kidnappers' hideout and summon the plaintiff's younger brother, Cai Yun Lin, to testify. According to the police investigation, the house on Route de Say Zoong is currently owned by the Xie Long Company. It is said that the house has changed hands several times since the plaintiff was kidnapped. The house on Zhou Jia Zui Road is owned by the Sincere Company, which also recently purchased it. Therefore, they knew nothing about it. Cai Yun Lin is ill today and cannot attend court. He had previously gone to the police station to identify the kidnappers. He said that the person who directly negotiated the ransom with him was not among them. Cai's prescription was then presented as evidence. Then, Cai Fu Lin was asked to testify. Judge Ge then summarized the previous testimonies of the defendants and asked them questions. The defendants also retained lawyers E Sen, Fan Gang, and Jiang Rong for their defense. Judge Ge then ordered the defendants to be returned to custody separately and adjourned the hearing to next Friday for the start of the debate.</p>

<p>▲ Bodyguards Refuse to Purchase Tickets</p>
<p>Shi Kang Nian (from Ningbo, 25 years old), the No. 12 ticket seller of the No. 4075 bus on the No. 3 route of the Zhabei Hua Shang Public Bus Company, was at the Datong Road Sun Temple station at 4:20 PM the day before yesterday when three bodyguards from the Zhenru District Second Regiment, members No. 103 Zhang Fu Quan, No. 114 Wang Jin Tao, and No. 129 Zhang Yi Bao, boarded the bus and refused to purchase tickets, leading to an argument. The bus stopped, and the three members jumped off the bus, grabbed the ticket seller Shi Kang Nian, and beat him severely.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>They struck him on the head, causing a hole and covering his face with blood. His waist was also severely injured. Kang Nian, unable to bear the pain, cried for help. The police officers from the Sun Temple police station of the Fourth District Public Security Bureau came out and took the three assailants and the injured Shi Kang Nian to the station and transferred them to the Fourth District for processing. After questioning, they ordered Shi Kang Nian to seek medical treatment on his own. The three members were detained, but they were soon released on bail. After receiving a report from Shi Kang Nian, the bus company sent a letter to the Fourth District Public Security Bureau yesterday, requesting that the three assailants compensate for the losses.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Three Who Fell to Their Deaths <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>▲ Yu Shanzhong, a resident of Hua Ji Road, Donggui Fang, in a flat house, was from Yangzhou.  He was over fifty years old and had long been a foreman at the docks.  He had been in Shanghai for several decades and had many friends.  He originally planned to return to his hometown tonight and come back to Shanghai in the middle of next month.  Unexpectedly, some of his friends heard about this and hosted a farewell banquet for him last night.  Yu couldn't refuse the gesture, so he went. After the meal, he was invited by another friend to see a Yangzhou opera at the Sanmin Theater on Xi'an Road. Being old and frail, while walking up the escalator on the middle level, he carelessly slipped and fell.  His skull was fractured, and he bled profusely.  He was taken to the Tongren Hospital for treatment by his friends, but his injuries were too severe, and he died yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>▲ Li Maozhi was from Zhenjiang and was already in his seventies, living a solitary life. He currently resided at the Tongxinggong Inn in the Maijiaquan area of Shandong Road.  He had previously opened the Chunyang Apartment in Xinkai River, but it closed due to poor business.  Li had been idle for too long, was destitute, and could barely afford food and clothing. He was mentally unstable.  At 11 a.m. the day before yesterday, he went to the Tianlaifu Electric Material Company on Simalu (Fourth Road) and Zhejiang Road to visit a friend.  As soon as he went up to the third floor, he lost his footing and fell to the ground. The back of his head cracked open, and he was on the verge of death.  Someone then called the police, and he was taken to Tongren Hospital for treatment.  Because of his age and weakness, the medicine was ineffective, and he died at 12:30 p.m. yesterday.</p>
<p>▲ Xu Er'er was from Wuxi and was 31 years old. He made a living selling fruit and lived at No. 309 Xiaoshadu Road in western Shanghai. His wife, Tang, was 30 years old. Last night, during dinner, he drank too much alcohol and became drunk, unable to control himself. At around 9 p.m., he insisted on inviting his neighbors to play mahjong. Unexpectedly, the light bulb had been borrowed by a neighbor.  Xu disregarded everything and staggered over to ask for it back. The neighbor's wife said, "You can just take it off yourself."  Xu immediately stood on a stool and climbed up. Carelessly, he fell to the ground, immediately lost consciousness, and was taken to police station No. 2893, then to Baolong Hospital.  Because he had been in a coma for too long, he eventually died.</p>

<p>Sir, I am writing on behalf of my client, Mr. Hu Tiaoyi, who was surprised to read in the news column of the Shen Bao on the 1st of this month a report entitled "Hu Zhaoxi Dies for His Wife". Although I once tried to mediate the rift between Hu Zhaoxi and his wife, there were many relatives and friends besides the lawyers on both sides who knew about the matter. Later, because the mediation was ineffective, each side went to extremes, and the mediator was helpless. The matter was then resolved by agreement between the lawyers on both sides. The facts are all there, and it is impossible to point fingers at random. I am now writing this letter on behalf of my client to ask your newspaper to correct the report based on the facts for the public to see. Yours sincerely, Lawyer Chen Zhongyin, February 3rd.</p>
<p>Sir, I have read in your local news column of February 2 the article "New Combination of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Hubei Guilds in the Chinese Medicine Industry", which states, "The regular expenses are borne by the industry, divided into two types: A, those who establish their own shops pay 40 yuan at a time; B, those who are affiliated with a firm pay 20 yuan at a time." This kind of regulation is the start-up fee that our members have agreed to share, and it must be approved by the higher-level guild before it can be collected. Because it is slightly inconsistent with the facts, I am afraid it will cause misunderstandings. Therefore, I am writing this letter to ask you to examine and publish it in the letters to the editor column to correct it. I would be grateful if you could do so. Yours sincerely, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Hubei Group Office, Shanghai Chinese Medicine Industry Guild. Sir, I have read the article "New Combination of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Hubei Guilds in the Chinese Medicine Industry" in your local news section of February 2, which is not entirely correct. On the 25th of this month, the Sichuan, Yunnan, and Hubei Group held a meeting to establish the group. Our association sent Executive Committee member Chen Wenming to attend and provide guidance. According to Chen's report, the organization of the group did not comply with the group rules drafted by our association and arbitrarily imposed membership fees, which was illegal. Chen stated his objection at the meeting. The group then submitted a report to the association, and the 11th Executive Committee meeting of our association decided that the crude organization of the group was difficult to record. In addition to notifying the group to reorganize according to law and returning the original documents, a special letter was sent to clarify the matter. Please allow it to be published in the letters to the editor column to show the facts. Thank you very much for your public assistance. Yours sincerely, Executive Committee, Shanghai Chinese Medicine Industry Guild, February 3rd.</p>
<p>Sir, I have read today's news in your newspaper about the French Concession Court continuing to hear the case of the Day and Night Bank, which states that "the five places belonging to the Gongfa Company, including the Hot Spring Bathhouse, Jiufu Company, and Chinese and Western Pharmacy", etc., are not true. Our company is a limited company and was registered with the National Registration Bureau in the 17th year of the Republic of China in accordance with the law, holding Registration No. 205. It has nothing to do with Gongfa Company. I am sincerely afraid that all circles will misunderstand. Therefore, I am writing this letter to clarify the matter and hope that you will publish it in the letters to the editor column to correct it to clarify the truth. To build public amity, Yours sincerely, Jiufu Co., Ltd., February 3rd.</p>

<h3 id="e167">Opening of the Shandong Provincial Educational Administrative Conference <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Shandong Provincial Department of Education convened the presidents of provincial schools to hold the second provincial educational administrative conference. The preparations have been reported in previous news. Yesterday (the 1st) at 10:00 a.m., the opening ceremony was held at the Provincial Women's Normal School in Nanguan. All members and staff except Sun Yuxi, the president of the Second Middle School, and Li Taihua, the president of the Third Middle School, were present. The only guests were Yang Zhensheng, the president of the National Qingdao University. The Jinan branch of the Commercial Press and the World Book Company came to the meeting to distribute educational supplies for entertainment. At 10:00 a.m., the meeting was held as scheduled. The chairman was He Siyuan, the master of ceremonies was Liu Cixiao, and the recorder was Yang Peng. First, the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting, saying that today is the opening of the second educational administrative conference. The most important task is to discuss the administrative difficulties of the 19th year and seek a solution for removal and improvement. At the first meeting last year, the difficulties of the 18th year were discussed, and a solution for removal and improvement was requested. However, after a year of implementation, many difficulties have arisen. This time, we must discuss the materials based on experience and earnestly remove and improve them. The scope of this discussion can be summarized as follows: (1) Difficulties: problems regarding the salary clock allocation of teachers and staff, and the distribution of temporary fees must be discussed. The most important problem is to pay attention to the detailed and rapid creation of budgets to avoid repeated approvals, corrections, and early arrival and early issuance regarding the problem of recruiting students, such as the enrollment of the Sixth Middle School and the First Middle School. Up to 1,000 applicants are there. The enrollment of one teacher is 40, and there are as many as 700 applicants. This is a good phenomenon, but it is enough to prove that the supply of schools does not meet the demand. We should discuss how to accommodate students or expand classes regarding equipment problems. We should discuss the methods of equipment for the convenience of students' studies, books, instruments, and all other equipment. Last month, Japanese supervisors came to Jinan to visit education and were surprised by the good atmosphere of the youth, but they were dissatisfied with the imperfection of the equipment. This is limited by financial resources, but it must also be discussed in detail to the extent of financial resources. Regarding the problem of enrollment, the Ministry of Education ordered that students from unregistered private schools should not be recruited. There have been many disputes in the past, and this should also be discussed. (2) Budget issues: In the 18th year, there were 20,020 primary and secondary schools in the province, with 700,000 students. The 19th year is not over, and it is estimated that there will be at least 35,000 primary and secondary schools up and down, with 1 million students. The education expenditure in the 18th year was 2.2 million yuan, and in the 19th year it was 2.8 million yuan. In the 20th year, the number of schools and students will increase, and the treatment of teachers and staff will be improved, so the budget will naturally have to increase. It is estimated that it can be increased to 3 million yuan. This budget should be discussed on how to distribute it and must be submitted to the central government by March 1 at the latest. (3) The entire education plan of the province: In order to accommodate as many students as possible, in addition to increasing classes in the original schools, it is planned to expand various schools throughout the province. To sum up in one sentence, the scope of discussion of this meeting is (1) to solve difficulties, (2) to prepare the 20th-year budget, and (3) to create the whole plan. The meeting method is different from the previous one. This time, a round table is adopted, so that each school can submit proposals as much as possible, without limiting the form, time, and scope. Also, the proposals of the previous general meeting must first be reviewed by the review committee, and the power of approval seems to be in the hands of the review committee. This time, the review committee will be changed to a research nature, and the results of the research will be submitted to the general meeting for public decision. Next, the guests Yang Zhensheng, Zhou Chao, the president of the Third Normal School, Sun Wei Yue, the president of the First Middle School, and Zhu Jingtang, the president of the Second Vocational School, spoke. Finally, Yang Chengrong, the director of the Shandong Mass Education Museum, reported on the work of the museum. At this point, the chairman announced that from tomorrow onwards, two formal meetings will be held every day from 9:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m., and the meeting period is uncertain, depending on the number of proposals. The ceremony was completed, and the meeting was adjourned. After the meeting, a dinner was held in the school.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education, in order to develop Mongolian and Tibetan education and train primary school teachers, yesterday issued an order to the Mongolian and Tibetan banners and sects to select outstanding and qualified students to study in normal high schools, normal science departments, or rural teachers' schools in the interior or border provinces to train teachers to return to their hometowns to serve. It is said that the number of schools set up in Mongolian and Tibetan areas is small. Although there are various reasons, the lack of teachers is one of the main reasons. In order to popularize Mongolian and Tibetan education, training teachers is an urgent task today. The Ministry has seen this and, in addition to actively preparing Mongolian and Tibetan schools in Nanjing and Xikang to set up normal classes and train such talents, the normal schools in the interior or border provinces that have achieved success can also train excellent teachers for Mongolian and Tibetan areas. For this reason, the Ministry orders each banner and sect to quickly select outstanding and qualified young students to study in normal schools, normal high school science departments, and rural normal schools in the interior or border provinces to train suitable teachers to return to their hometowns and engage in local education work. This is very important. This order.</p>

<h3 id="e171">Party and Government Agencies Investigate the Zhonggong School Incident <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>The Board of Directors Telegraphs the Ministry of Education for Handling</p>
<p>(Kuomintang News Agency) The sudden change in the Zhonggong School turmoil was reported yesterday. However, the content of the school is complex and changes rapidly. It is specially reported separately.</p>
<p>▲ The Board of Directors telegraphed the Ministry of Education. After the drastic change in the school the day before yesterday (2nd), Chairman Cai immediately convened a temporary meeting of the Board of Directors to seek a solution. It was originally scheduled to be held at Cai's residence at 6:00 p.m. However, seeing Ma Junwu instigating three student representatives to come to the scene to disrupt the meeting, the location was temporarily changed to the Cangzhou Hotel. A total of seven directors arrived at the Cangzhou Hotel: Cai Yuanpei, Gao Yihan, Wang Yunwu, Liu Binglin, Yang Xingfo, Ding Gouyin, and Ma Junwu. As they were about to start the meeting, the three disrupting students rushed to the scene again. All the directors were very dissatisfied. Therefore, a general resignation was proposed. It is now heard that Chairman Cai has telegraphed the details to the Ministry of Education and stated that the directors cannot be held responsible. The Ministry of Education is asked to handle everything.</p>
<p>▲ Party and government agencies sent personnel to investigate. After the representatives the day before yesterday aroused the public anger of all students and resisted in self-defense, the students closed all the offices and sent classmates to guard the doors of each office to prevent the representatives from returning to the school to take control under false pretenses. Yesterday afternoon, personnel from the Municipal Party Department, the Government Public Security Bureau, and the Municipal Education Bureau came to the school with Battalion Commander Xiong and District Chief Yang to inspect the school for a week. They thought the situation was very good and instructed the students not to disturb each other and to wait quietly for the Ministry of Education to issue a clear order to solve the problem. It is also heard that Chen, the Vice Minister of the Ministry of Education, happened to come to Shanghai on official business at the time of the Zhonggong School turmoil. He has a clear understanding of the truth of the school turmoil. He returned to Beijing yesterday, and it is expected that a thorough solution will be announced soon.</p>
<p>▲ Ma Junwu's enticement of Battalion Commander Xiong. According to a source from a certain agency, when the school was being assaulted the day before yesterday, Ma Junwu asked the battalion headquarters to send a team to suppress the incident and offered a letter of appointment, asking Battalion Commander Xiong to serve as a military instructor with a monthly salary of 200 yuan. Battalion Commander Xiong considered it an insult and strongly rejected it. Later, the battalion headquarters received a phone call from the Public Security Bureau, and Battalion Commander Xiong sent a company of soldiers to maintain order.</p>
<p>▲ The students issued a statement to the faculty. The students of the school sent a letter to the faculty yesterday, stating that Mr. Ma Junwu had been approved to resign by the Board of Directors and had long lost his qualifications as president. All the letters of appointment and all documents issued recently in the name of the president would not have any effect. Teachers are intelligent and should not be fooled.</p>
<p>▲ The announcement of the extension of the Zhonggong New Students. The first enrollment examination for new students for the winter vacation was originally scheduled to be announced on the 4th, but it could not be announced as scheduled due to unforeseen circumstances. It is heard that it is planned to publish a notice in the newspaper announcing the date of the announcement and to notify the admitted students one by one.</p>
<p>▲ The attitude of the current faculty members. The current faculty members of Zhonggong School, Pan Guangdan and others, cannot use the name of Zhonggong faculty members because the contracts of the previous faculty members have expired. Moreover, the executive committee of the current faculty members was elected at the Zhongshe in Weihaiwei Road the day before yesterday. To avoid confusing the public, it is planned to publish a notice to make a solemn statement.</p>

<h3 id="e173">Dr. Wang Jingqi Discusses the Key Problems of Labor Education <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>▲ There are special difficulties in addition to the difficulties of ordinary education.</p>
<p>Dr. Wang Jingqi, the president of the National Labor University, recently published his opinions on labor education due to numerous inquiries about the situation. The general gist is as follows:</p>
<p>I have only been at Labor University for a few weeks. I have not yet studied the situation thoroughly, so I cannot talk about improvements. However, if I just follow my personal behavior, it is very simple. I just need to earnestly do every word of the oath I took on the 19th of last month. What I said to the portrait of the late Premier was the truth. I should also do real things for the school. Before various parties advised me to take on the role of Labor University president, a few friends advised me not to, saying, "Running an educational institution is the most difficult thing, and running a Labor University is the most difficult among the difficult." Therefore, some still advocated that I should go abroad or handle diplomacy domestically, and not engage in educational administration because I have little experience or confidence in this area. However, after seeking consent, I never declined or retreated from difficulties. But today, I also feel that in addition to the difficulties of running things in the ordinary education field, the Labor University has two special difficulties.</p>
<p>One is the special understanding of labor education in our country, namely, the so-called "labor educationization" and "education laborization." This is the ideal advocated and implemented by the Kuomintang after unifying China. This most noble ideal involves transferring the most profound knowledge (universities) to the lowest level of society. In developed countries in Europe and America, as far as I know, it is still in the realm of ideals. What they call labor education can be summarized into two types:</p>
<p>First, vocational schools provide practical and necessary skills to society, giving people the opportunity to study and work part-time. Of course, the level of knowledge cannot keep up with that of students at other universities.</p>
<p>Second, the state and society find ways to enable poor children to study advanced knowledge in universities.</p>
<p>The Labor University-ization and university laborization ideals in our country are at a higher level than those of other countries, making laborers receive university education or making those receiving university education engage in labor at the same time. In addition to the ordinary university system, a period of work experimentation is added. The first question is whether the workers have interest in it and whether they can allocate time and ability properly.</p>
<p>The second is the problem of the Labor University factory. The Labor University factory was originally a model factory. In the early years, it lost money every year. After several years, not only did it not have sufficient power to develop, but it also declined. Furthermore, whether its equipment is suitable for students to work with is also a problem. All industries operated by the state, no matter what country or how well managed, are inferior to those operated by merchants. Therefore, state-owned factories have always lost money, especially in China. It is impossible for the Labor University factory to be entirely operated by students without workers. Even if students do only a part of the work, the cost of raw materials, the time consumption, and the impact on the progress of the workers are extremely inconvenient. Assuming that the current Labor University factory is still operated by the school and students are added for practice, it will inevitably lose money, but there is no money to lose. If the factory is closed down, the machinery will not be easily preserved. If it is not closed down, where does the school have so many financial resources to subsidize it? If it is not closed down and it is allowed to circulate and take on more external orders, where will the circulating capital for manufacturing goods come from? These points are unavoidable difficulties for the Labor University in running a factory. What I am specially pointing out is not that I am afraid to move forward, but that I want the people of society to know the key problems of the Labor University so that they can provide enlightened opinions at any time. I know it is difficult, but I am still willing to do it, and there is no strange method. However, the first step is how to find ways to save costs and concentrate financial resources to reorganize, and I hope that the government will provide monthly financial assistance, so that I can save. The Labor University has not been established for long, and it has suffered many difficulties. Its vitality has not yet been fully restored. I only hope that the students and colleagues in the school can work together to promote the unprecedented labor education in China and lead people to a bright and upright path. Abiding by the oath of January 19th would be a blessing for my entire life.</p>

<h3 id="e179">Citroen's Planned New Car for Sale at a Particularly Low Price <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Citroen cars are famous throughout the world for their excellent structure and reliable quality, which has been the case for many years. Furthermore, their low selling price is unmatched in the automotive industry. In 1926, the company added a large manufacturing plant in the Four Roads area of ​​Bourgogne, using the latest scientific methods to manufacture large quantities of vehicles to meet the needs of all parts of the world. Today, the organization of the factory is becoming more and more perfect, and the products are becoming more and more refined. The new cars planned by them are also improving with each passing day. I will briefly describe what I know as follows.</p>
<p>The most important new car planned by the factory is a four-cylinder sedan with a total selling price of only 185 pounds. Based on the absolute reliability of the currently popular 13-36 horsepower four-cylinder Citroen chassis, you can imagine the excellence and beauty of the new car, as its construction is similar. The new car is given the beautiful name of "Gelton." The body structure is extremely excellent, extremely beautiful, and its spaciousness and comfort are even more unattainable. The car has four doors and six windows. All the equipment that car enthusiasts are accustomed to is available.

<h3 id="e180">A Study of Automobile Driving and Color by Pei Gan <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>▲ The use of color is related to safety</p>
<p>▲ More attention should be paid to driving a car</p>
<p>At first glance, the issue of color and car safety seems to be unrelated. However, because color has a very strong reflective power, it is closely related to the safety of driving. Traffic experts widely use color for various things, from children to trucks. They know that the reflected light of color can be clearly felt even at long distances, at dusk, or after dark, as if it were daytime.</p>
<p>The Safety Department of the American Automobile Association recently published its research results, stating that children on the street wearing light-colored clothes are more noticeable at a distance than those wearing dark-colored clothes. Therefore, children should not be allowed to pass through the main roads unless they are extremely cautious, and car drivers must be warned from a distance due to the light reflected by light-colored clothing.</p>
<p>Color is also very important in avoiding accidents on the road. The method is to use various signs and symbols to draw attention to them. The principle is that some colors have the special quality of reflecting light, so people can recognize various signs, objects, and symbols at a glance.</p>
<p>The stronger the reflection of color, the easier it is to spot it at a distance, and it can attract attention even in dimly lit places. Therefore, the Road Safety Department has put a lot of effort into this research. According to color experts, white has the strongest reflective power among all colors, followed by cream. After that, in descending order, are ivory, leather tan, light green, yellow, gray, light blue, light red, dark brown, dark red, and dark green.</p>
<p>From the above, we know that white is the best color on the road. If used with black, whether as text or as a background, its reflective power is even stronger due to contrast. Therefore, black and white are often used together as signs and symbols. The adoption of other colors sometimes has an unusual reflective power because the use of incompatible colors together can often attract attention, exceeding both black and white. The Road Marking Committee of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers has</p>

<p>Turkey is known as a "man's country" because of its emphasis on men and its disregard for women. In recent years, the women's rights movement has been very popular in various countries, and Turkey has also responded. A woman in Constantine is currently studying car driving, passed the examination by the Engineering Bureau, and was given a chauffeur's license to drive a taxi.</p>
<p>The lady's name is Ma Meihai, a beautiful 29-year-old who entered a car school. She is physically fit and has special achievements. For this test, the lady chose a new Chevrolet sedan, equipped with a business trip accessory. The test results were satisfactory. Today, the lady is driving passengers between cities, making her the first female driver in the country.</p>

<p>After investigating the national motorcycle transportation situation, they established a unified road transportation agreement. The commonly used color combinations they cited are as follows: railroad crossings, white background with black text; railroad crossing entrances, yellow background with black text; stop, yellow background with red text; slow down, yellow background with black text; caution, black text on yellow background; winding one-way, white arrow on black background; inquiry, white background with black text; no parking, white background with red text; limited parking, white background with green text; pedestrian restrictions, white background with blue text; other restrictions, white background with black text.</p>
<p>The use of colors other than black and white together is considered by car drivers or pedestrians to be a special warning that requires their attention. From a psychological point of view, anything that disturbs the driver outside of normal routines is not appropriate. However, the various colors listed above, whether background or text, are rich in reflected light. Is black text on a white background or white text on a black background better? This question should be determined based on whether or not lights need to be used for illumination at night. If lights need to be used, then a black background with white text is best. In general, a black background is good at absorbing light and making the white text more obvious.</p>
<p>Therefore, from the perspective of the safety of car drivers, white is an important color. Therefore, ground markings, fences, pillars, tree trunks, etc. are mostly painted white, which can have a strong reflection even on rainy and foggy days. Fences painted white can also reduce danger in winding places. White markings on the road also have a huge effect. The most common marking on the road is the center line, which is often marked in white. In the past, road engineers did not know that white had a strong reflective power, so they used black lines as boundaries.</p>
<p>The American Society of Mechanical Engineers also has regulations for the materials used for marking. All materials such as wood and metal are detailed. The type of paint also has a certain standard. Metal signs and symbols must be coated with enamel-like oil paint for durability. The paint composition of wooden signs must be non-changing and non-fading, and the surface must be smooth, durable, and free of cracks. When making wooden signs, the paint must be applied three times to prevent color loss. Each time it is applied, it must be allowed to dry before applying more. If fences and pillars are painted in this way, and the paint is of high quality, their lifespan can be extended for three years.</p>
<p>Drivers of trucks often use a wooden fake hand to signal to cars behind them when turning left or right. This wooden hand is often painted white for easy viewing. The reflected light of white also has other convenient uses that are used by individual car drivers. For example, when driving into a garage at night and feeling dark and inconvenient, you can draw two white lines on the narrow road in advance for the wheels to follow when moving, and draw a white line inside the garage as a stop mark, which is extremely safe.</p>

<p>The most developed construction project in Zhejiang Province is highways. Since Director Chen took office, he has been carrying out the project step by step. The six major trunk lines can be completed one after another, which is of no small benefit to facilitating transportation and benefiting the people. The situation of each line is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>1.  The Hangzhou-Changxing Line runs from Hangzhou to Changxing's Fuzi Mountain, with a branch line from Wukang to Mogan Mountain. This line goes directly to the capital. Currently, the line is delayed because of gravel piles on the Jiangsu road in Yixing.</p>
<p>2.  The Xiaoshao Line runs from Xixing Riverside to Shaoxian's Wuyunmen, connecting the privately-run Shengxin Yu road line.</p>
<p>3.  The Hangping Line runs from Hangzhou to Pinghu, passing through Changan, Haining, and Dazha Pu. Recently, the road surface construction of the Zha Ping section has not been completed, and it cannot be opened to traffic for a while. There is also the Yuanhua Town branch line. This line can be connected to the Jiangsu road to reach Shanghai.</p>
<p>4.  The Hangchang Line has now been opened to Yuqian Changhua. Because the bridge there has not been completed and construction is difficult, it can be opened to traffic to reach Anhui Province once it is completed. However, this line passes through the Hangzhou-Yu's Lin Liang privately-run automobile companies.</p>
<p>5.  The Hangfu Line, from Hangzhou directly to Fuyang, is the shortest line. It is privately-run and has not been perfected. The Highway Bureau has taken it back and allocated 130,000 yuan to actively repair it. It will be opened to traffic in the spring tea</p>

<p>▲ French automobile industry develops The French automobile manufacturing industry has developed very well recently. Compared with all countries in the world, the United States is the champion, followed by France. Compared with the various industries in France, the automobile manufacturing industry ranks third. The first is wheat production, and the second is the wine industry. Although American-made, British-made, and German-made cars are often exported to France, according to statistics, for every two foreign cars shipped to France, France will exceed it by exporting five cars. Therefore, no matter what, its automobile export industry will certainly exceed imports by far. The French government levies particularly high import taxes on automobiles. For cars with more than 15 horsepower, whether they are assembled in France or imported as complete vehicles from foreign countries, a very high tariff must be levied. In comparison, Citroen Renault and other cars manufactured in France with no more than 10 horsepower have many advantages. The national wealth occupied by the French automobile industry is 6,500,000,000 francs, the wheat industry is 11 billion francs, the wine industry is 7 billion francs, and the silk industry is 6 billion francs. The steel used by France to manufacture cars last year was enough to build 25 large iron towers with surplus. A total of 245,000 tons of steel, 45,000 tons of cast iron, 12,000 tons of copper, 4,500 tons of paint, 3,300 tons of cotton, and 250,000 square meters of glass were used, which is also very impressive.</p>
<p>▲ Self-driving rental cars The Hanless Company in Camden Town, England, has recently created a new self-driving rental car business. The company prepares six-cylinder and eight-cylinder Studebaker cars. There are no drivers, and the renters drive themselves. The fee is 11 pence per mile, one shilling, or one shilling and three pence, etc., depending on the newness and size of the car. A reduction of one or two pence will be given after using more than 50 miles. From then on, similar deductions will be made. There are other preferential discounts for renters who use the car for a certain distance and shorten the time during the year. This method is very convenient for foreign tourists because they can get suitable transportation even if their stay is limited. Those who like to drive but do not want to buy a car are also very welcome to this rental method.</p>
<p>▲ Feixia Cars Win Honors Repeatedly In addition to driving speed, automobile competitions include various competitions such as the beauty of the car body and the comfort of driving. In this regard, Feixia cars often win in European competitions. (1) In the Sadu Pei competition in Portugal, the Feixia No. 525 four-wheeled van won. In the Calia local competition, the Feixia two-seater No. 521 car won the first prize. (2) In the Salando competition in Italy, Feixia cars of various types won the first prize. (3) In France, in the Leli local competition, Feixia cars won the standard first prize among cars manufactured in foreign countries.</p>
<p>▲ Marius cars sell for 100 pounds Marius small cars have always been known for their exquisiteness and durability. Sir William Marius, the owner, decided to sell them to the public for 100 pounds. This plan has been realized. The Marius car factory has sold the Marius small car with two seats for 100 gold pounds thanks to its large output and special economic manufacturing methods. This new car is slightly different from the ordinary Marius car with two seats. The original intention of manufacturing the car is not to compete with the existing ones, but to provide simple and practical small cars to the general public at a low price within the possible range. Those who purchase this car only need to pay a price of 100 pounds to get a car with two seats, and the fuel and recurring expenses are also very limited on weekdays. The Marius car factory has specially hired many car workers and greatly promoted its sales methods for the sake of manufacturing this new car.</p>
<p>▲ Chevrolet cars tour Germany Recently, a German company specializes in selling electric washing machines. They use Chevrolet trucks to tour the country as a promotional advertisement. The method is to use glass as the car body, with three washing machines inside. The motors of the car are used to show the working process. In addition to placing machines, there is still room in the car body for visitors to test on the spot. As a result, sales are booming. The company specially sent a letter to General Motors, praising the function of Chevrolet cars, saying that the journey was 14,000 kilometers and there were no obstacles along the way.</p>
<p>▲ Announcement To San Yuan, Dai, Pei Gan, Ji, , Ke Jia, Ding, Ke Luo, Ding Zuzhe, Zhi Zheng, Huang Yingdai, Cheng Yuqing, gentlemen. Thank you very much for the manuscripts you have sent us last month. I have prepared a small amount of compensation. Please open a bill and collect it from the accounting department of our museum.

<h3 id="e186">Grassland Weekly, Fourth Volume, Numbers 4, 5, 6 <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>In the transitional period of the gradual decline of proletarian literature and the deeper development of national literature, many nationalistic literary publications have emerged. Among these publications, "Grassland Weekly" is relatively strong and at the forefront. Although its format is small, its content is exceptionally brilliant and rich. It has now been published to the fourth volume. Artistically, it is clear that each issue has made great progress.</p>
<p>The recently published Fourth Volume, Numbers 4, 5, and 6, contains, in addition to the reporter's three "Post-Editorial Notes" and Wang Tiehua's "Waiting for You" and Huang Huanruo's "Consolation" (both continued), the following works: Mi Luo's "New Year's Blessing," "Fireside Chats," "Urban Loose Strings," Wang Fen's "Before and After Death," Guo Lanxin's "Steep Cliff," Tang Zengyi's "My Heart Burning Like a Coal," "Encouragement Song," "Miss Nina," Ye Du's "I Overlook from the Balcony," Hui Xiang's "Cuckoo in a Magpie's Nest," Wang Qihuai's "Liang Dingyuan," Zou Fang's "Three Pairs of Lovers," and "Literary News," etc., all of which are rare and valuable works.</p>
<p>Wang Fen's "Before and After Death" tells the story of a farmer named Chen Dabo's son. Since the son was clearly taken away by some army three or four years ago to serve as a soldier, he cursed soldiering and war. Later, his son suddenly returned home, but soon died of spitting blood. This was naturally due to wounds sustained in battle. The death of Chen Dabo's son made the people in the town deeply aware of the danger and terror of being a soldier. However, he instead received an inspiration from his son's last words. He thought:</p>
<p>"My son's fighting is revolution, revolution is glorious, and my son's death is also glorious. No one can avoid death. Rather than dying sickly in bed, it is better to take a bullet in the revolution, or die spitting blood like my son. When my son died, wasn't he not resentful? Perhaps he wasn't in pain. He himself said that serving as a soldier is what the people should do, revolution for the entire nation, and fighting for revolution is a good thing. Although he died, he was very happy because he said that he had fulfilled his duty as a citizen. So why should I worry and grieve?" Therefore, Chen Dabo did not hate war as he did in the past, and he explained to many young people who were afraid of being soldiers and encouraged them to participate in the revolution. After his death, several townspeople in military uniforms were already among those who came to mourn.</p>
<p>Self-interest and selfishness are common characteristics of the Chinese people, especially farmers with shallow knowledge. They have a deathly fear of being soldiers, and they do not care about the happiness of the entire population, but only fear the sacrifice of the small self. On the other hand, they selfishly feel that being a soldier is very easy. "Before and After Death," the author seized on this ideological mistake and gave them a major blow. In this way, we can know that the events expressed by the author in the work not only have a central consciousness of nationalism, but also give people a great inspiration. In terms of technique, the author also has a kind of power, this power is able to greatly excite our hearts. Just this "forceful emotion" can prove the author's success.</p>
<p>Wang Qihuai's "Liang Dingyuan" is also a very good creation. The author's description is very profound and moving. The story tells of an upward-looking young man who, seeing the current situation, "...with imperialism baring its fangs and claws, eager to try, and warlords and military men rampaging internally, killing and looting everywhere, so that natural and man-made disasters come frequently, causing the people of the whole country to cry out to the heavens, and corpses of the hungry are everywhere..." he felt "...we who live in this age of raging waves should have the spirit of striving upward. If I don't go to hell, who will? If I don't take this responsibility, who will take it..." So he resolved to follow Ban Dingyuan's story of giving up his pen and joining the army, leaving the university and entering military academy, to struggle for the survival and revitalization of the entire Chinese nation in a difficult environment.</p>
<p>After reading the outline of this novel, we can know how clearly our author recognizes the current era and the increasingly degraded national status. Therefore, the author awakens us, the youth who live in today's bitter age, that we should not hide behind the times, but must catch up with the tide of the times. The author further indicates the mission we should bear, "...We are young people, we must rise up and save ourselves, do not be pessimistic..." "Awaken national consciousness, unite our hearts and minds, and strive for the Chinese nation..." In the end, the author said so grandly, "...Father, let your current son Dingyuan shoulder this responsibility..."</p>
<p>This is indeed a powerful work of nationalist literature. As for the poetry in the three issues of "Grassland Weekly," Tang Zengyi's is the best. The author is a poet, and a poet with great talent. He also has a flood of fiery emotions, such as:</p>
<p>············</p>
<p>I hold up a precious sword,</p>
<p>To kill you, you violent one,</p>
<p>I wield a steel knife,</p>
<p>To kill you, you insidious one,</p>
<p>············</p>
<p>My heart burns like a coal</p>
<p>············</p>
<p>I am not afraid of the thorns everywhere,</p>
<p>Go, go bravely,</p>
<p>Cut off the obstacles of China,</p>
<p>Open up the barren Yai Mountain,</p>
<p>············</p>
<p>| Encouragement Song</p>
<p>These poems are full of passion and grandeur. How vigorously the author encourages us to strive for the Chinese nation. These poems all contain great significance and should be valued. It seems that too much has been said, so let's end here. The works introduced here are all relatively important. As for the rest, each article is limited by space and cannot be described in detail.</p>
