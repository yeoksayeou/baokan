<h3>世界之毒物談</h3>
<p>假使毒物認爲商品各國間可以自由貿易則亦不必多言如謂人道主義之故視爲害人之物則中國乃受害之國所有毒物大抵爲他國所產中所製造所推行所遺留而流毒於中國者今世界名爲禁制毒物之團體不責以毒物害人之國而於受毒物之害之國責備惟恐不苛此其舉措寗得謂平故吳凱聲博士抗議遠東鴉片吸食調查團報告書表明中國政府現正欲肅清烟害並取締國內麻醉品云云在我國固當聲明而在產生製造及推行之國聞之當自慚愧也</p>
<p>又據埃及警局麻醉品股主任發表謂歐洲製造毒藥之廠雖監視視前較嚴但海洛英高根興哈希施大批毒藥由君士坦丁運出甚多君士坦丁幾爲非法麻醉品運入東方與美洲之大來源云又據紐約電稱聯邦當局在外來輪船上　查嗎啡後即從事調查現悉有一國際私運毒藥機關以兩巴黎人爲領袖聞去年私運嗎啡入美共値二千萬元云云可知歐洲之國以毒物自利者大有人在徒苛責受毒物之害之國初無補於禁制毒物之本義也</p>

<h3>記王女士之逃婚</h3>
<p>筑鳴</p>
<p>吾父南歸。行篋中題王耕烟歲寒三友拳石圖七古一首。中有句云。﹁朅聞延津合故劍。盈階秀茁之蘭叢。向平且辦娛老計。未要五嶽支吟笻﹂數語。指一極新頴之逃婚故實。晚近逃婚之劇。導演者鮮不爲其情人。而王女士獨異於是。是不可不大書特書也。</p>
<p>王耕烟先生者。官青島法院。昔在皖時。有一妻一妾。嫡出一女已嫁。妾生一女三子。女已畢業中學矣。耕烟爲訂婚某氏。嫁有日而未得女同意。女度老父頑梗。不可以爭丶遂奉母挾弟出走。不知所之。論者謂女必與所歡偕亡。際此潮流。固無足異也。然事有出人意料者。女之出亡。實自食其力。蓋旣卒業中學。中英文咸有根抵。謀之師友。遂止蘇爲小學敎員。以束修所得。奉母養弟。不特無情人。且絕口不談婚事。洎革命軍興。遂投身革命工作丶。由蘇之粵。又由粵至京。服務於首都公安局。自以背父出走。所爭爲婚姻自由。故崖岸自高。少所許可。至是始識浙中某君。月夕花晨。雅有情　。乃漸有委身之意。然間關千里。與父已不相聞。時局大定。始輾轉訪得其父所在。奉母挈弟來歸。在外八年。母埀老而弟亦長成。其事乃大白。去年某月。甫由其父主婚。在都與某君舉行婚禮。其嚼然不同於流俗。蓋如此。女士在蘇敎學時。化名爲蔣季華。以其姓與吾宗有連。故樂爲之記也。</p>
<h3>二十年一月三夕偕默君於焦山枕江閣待月得雨兼示同遊諸君</h3>
<p>— 邵翼如</p>
<p>昔年曾宿松寥庵。醉看寒玉澄江潭。呼婦起坐夜方午。搜句直欲星辰探。爾來三載困塵饑。車轍轔轢嗟未諳。幸茲歲朝得休沐。便著芒鞵穿霜嵐。嚴威凜冽萬木死。祇餘冰萼香正酣。焦山山靈舊相識。同遊况有客兩三丶老僧開室揖我坐丶共被妙墨啓金函。丹青縱橫逸興發。禪機徽婉造化參。夜闌啓戶望霄漢。江月未出山雨湛。枕江聽雨亦清絕。何必流輝情始耽。人生當頭月有幾。待月得雨味更醰。頗似奇文吐險怪。婦除平易鬥嶔嵁。曉來臨江光潑眼。杲杲日出照疏龕。乘興更發南郊南。</p>
<h3>凍瘡</h3>
<p>葉華女士</p>
<p>費昆年博士。邇由德奧行醫歸國。昨蒞舍約賞雪景。途中家人詢及凍瘡問題。渠乃歷舉以告。茲記於次。</p>
<p>患處凍瘡俗稱死血。又名凍瘃。凡身體遇束縛受壓力之部分。如足趾·足踵·踝關節。凍瘡易生。衣服不能遮蓋處之耳·鼻·面·手等。亦爲其大本營。患後。該局部先現蒼白色。迨血管麻痺。乃成青紅色。繼即腫脹而麻癢。此種現象。遇熱度過高時。則膚感大半消失。麻癢特甚。最後即成潰瘍破裂。若再受寒。勢釀壞疽。藥石難治矣。</p>
<p>原因此瘡原因不一。大槪由於貧血。萎黃病。日常進食不足。時感肚肌。飲酒過多。吸烟過度。患傷寒。罹虎列剌。遭痢疾。以此禦寒力减少。瘡遂侵入。其在足部者。係鞋靴不適。或過小。或結帶過緊。或襪薄。以致刺戟局部。血脈不和。頻見胖子常受凍瘃之苦者。以其動作緩慢。有碍血液活動也。</p>
<p>療法病者將患處擱高。用雪冰冷品摩擦之。以活血脈。苟用熱品。反增不舒。故宜戒絕。平日在家。手足各部。可用冷熱交換浴洗擦。法以面盆兩只。一置三十八度至四十度之熱水。一置十度至十五度之冷水。先將患處浸投熱水盆二分鐘。然後浸入冷水盆半分鐘。旋復入熱水盆。如是往返。約自四次至六次。惟最後一次須在冷水盆。另有一法專用熱水。其度數最低爲三十九。最高至四十二。水中置檞樹皮。或糡或蘇打或明礬或粰皮少許。擇一而浴之。上述兩法同時並用。亦無不可。每日曝晒瘡處於太陽下。亦一良法。人工太陽燈與電氣按摩。功效最速。施行五六次即可告痊。雖已潰破。仍可診療。倘因貧血傷寒而患凍瘡者。則先治病源。最爲上策。市上出售之凍瘡膏。何止恒河沙數。要以Ｕｎｇｔ．Ｃｅｒｕｓｓａｌ　Ｃａｍｐｈｏｒａｔｕ日曁Ｔａｎｎｉｃ　Ｏｉｎｔｍｅｎｔ較善。</p>
<p>工藝術界消息海上名畫家。由賀天健錢瘦鐵孫雪泥鄭午昌馬企周馬孟容謝公展熊松泉商笙伯葉渭莘等組織蜜蜂畫社已九閱月矣。此次爲比國賽會。國畫品評得全世界第一之榮譽。合社畫家。更爲得意。乃有推廣爲中國畫會之提議。自本月五日起假新世界飯店。召集同人。開一談話會。議决先由畫社同人。合作山水花鳥人物。開一畫展會。將所得之欵。半充善舉。半充會費。連日工作頗勤。已得百餘幅。并倩詞人謝至岑奚燕子沈劍知等題詩。論者咸謂詩書畫三絕定畫者日必數十起。洵破天荒之盛况云。（老蔗　　出版界沙息文華書局出版之﹁電影月刋﹂。向由盧夢殊君主編。盧刻君因事煩辭職。由周世勳君繼續擔任。周君從事電影有年。對於取材方面。素主嚴格。刻該刋第五期業已出版丶。內容頗多精彩。即印刷一層。亦較精美。聞自六期起將更有驚人之改革云。</p>

<h3>按摩考</h3>
<p>秋水</p>
<p>按摩。英語曰麻煞奇Ｍａｓｓａｇｅ源出於希臘。意謂磨擦也。古代之希臘人民。凡遇各種疾病。在未受醫術相當之手術以前。多用按摩以治之。在醫術最發達之德國。凡偶患傷風感冒·大便不通·肝臟病·腎臟病·或皮膚病等。在未用藥治之前。亦多以按摩爲試騐之方。亦足奇矣。相傳按摩之術。源於中國。（意之按。中國稱之曰推拿）。其發明期約在耶穌紀元前之三千年。其後印度人傳之。（紀元前七百年間）再傳於羅爲。羅馬人用以治戰爭時受皮膚傷之武士。其後希臘得其法丶視爲萬靈之方藥丶用以治各病矣。然至耶穌降世之後。則歐西人民。鮮有用之者。直至一七七六年丶有體育專家名林堅利克Ｇｅｎｒｉｃｈ者興。提倡按摩之術。設一按摩院於司都克河馬（瑞典國京城）Ｓｔｏｃｈｏｌｍ專爲運動員各種皮膚筋骨之傷。此爲世界各地開設按摩院之嚆矢。其後安格門及柴婆都佛司金兩教授Ｐｒｏｆｓ．Ｅｎｇｅｒｍａｎ　ａｎｄ　Ｚａｂｕｄｏｖｓｋ　相繼予以提倡。乃風行一時也。至今冷街僻巷。多有一塊白板。狂書按摩院字樣者丶其中黑幕重重。借醫學爲幌而無惡不作者。何可勝數。殊非昔年提倡者之所料及也。不亦哀哉。考按摩之術。初亦爲醫術之一。用之得法。奏效如神。用之不得其法。則能貽害於無窮。寄語海上熱心按摩之人士。其母以寶貴之身體。輕作嘗試之品也。　　意之曰。本篇作者爲奈其君。曾載原文於字林西報。偶見其所言足以諷世也。爰爲譯而出之。以示國人。</p>
<h3>巴黎物語</h3>
<p>六曾寄於巴黎</p>
<p>回到城內。伊更隨落得一天比一天深。伊喝起酒來了。每天蹀蹼街頭。身上一文沒有。天下雪時。避到那些小酒店裡。別人給伊一杯酒喝。呌伊說出和那死刑犯最後一夜的情形。某晚就在這樣的境况中重遇着了伊以前的未婚夫。那男子動了不忍之心。想把伊帶回去。但別人都議笑他。竭力阻止他和伊同走。</p>
<p>托尼斯加逃出酒店後。在街上被馬踏倒了。伊徐徐的在伊的未婚夫懐裡斷了氣。</p>
<p>這影片的情節大槪如此。我摘述得太簡單一點。但單就這簡單的叙說看來。已可知道這影片的內容非常哀楚了。死刑犯的最後一夜和𠟂子手的期待等。可以說己在影戲史上留下了不能磨滅的記載。</p>
<p>一個大藝術家的出現。使得這影片更增了許多光彩。我們以前在﹁愛諾迪根﹂一片中已見過利拉（ＩｔａＲｉｎａ）女士的倩影。在﹁托尼斯加﹂一片中伊更盡量的表現出了伊的許多優點。托尼斯加一角本來很不易飾的。但利拉却做得那樣好。質撲丶自然而又悲壯。伊的美貌用不着讚美。最動人的是伊那種天賦的悲劇的才藝。</p>

<h3>Northwest Army of Jin Begins Reorganization and Dismissal</h3>
<p>Military Commission Credentials and Seals Issued</p>
<p>Jin Generals Request Zhang to Delay Departure from Tianjin</p>
<p>Tianjin, Zhang Xueliang, on the afternoon of the 16th, separately summoned the generals of the Northwest and Shanxi armies for talks, and issued a joint telegram from the commander-in-chief and deputy commander to the generals. The gist of the telegram was to appoint so-and-so as the commander or division commander of the nth army, etc. Since the credentials and seals of office had not yet arrived, the generals would implement the reorganization and dismissal based on this telegram. It is reported that the First Army of Shang Zhen, the Second Army of Xu Yongchang, the Third Army of Song Zheyuan, the Fourth Army of Yang Aiyuan, the Fifth Army of Fu Zuoyi, the Independent First Division of Pang Bingxun, and the Second Division of Sun Dianying, all have no Northeast Army designation and are directly under the Central Government. According to Song's talk, he received 120,000 yuan for the reorganization and dismissal, approximately 30,000 men will be dismissed, and two divisions will be retained, with Zhang Zizhong and Feng Zi'an as division commanders. The remaining middle and lower-ranking officers will be sent to the Baoding Military Academy and the Northeast Jiangwu Hall respectively. If there are any remaining, a military officer training regiment will be established for advanced studies. The remaining senior officers will be appointed by Zhang as counselors and advisors to the deputy commander's office. The reorganization and dismissal expenses are significantly insufficient. If the loan from Shanxi Province can be established, it may provide some assistance. It has not yet been determined whether the future monthly military pay will be the responsibility of the Central Government or the Northeast. Zhang will leave Tianjin for Shenyang within three days. According to Pang's talk, he received 50,000 yuan for reorganization and dismissal, which is sufficient for his smaller force. In the future, they will be stationed north of Shijiazhuang and south of Baoding. According to Gao Guizi's talk, his troops will be reorganized by Shang Zhen and changed to the nth division, which is currently unknown. He will meet with Shang tonight to finalize it. (16th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>Tianjin, Zhang Xueliang, on the afternoon of the 16th, summoned the generals to give instructions in person: He himself will return to Fengtian the day after tomorrow. If there are no major matters for you in Tianjin, you can return to your defense areas early to handle the reorganization and dismissal. The Jin generals said that division commanders such as Sun Chu and Li Fuying will arrive in Tianjin within days. Could the deputy commander delay his departure slightly to give instructions to the division commanders? Zhang said that if the division commanders can arrive in Tianjin within days, he can stay for an extra day or two to meet with them. (16th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>Tianjin, Shang Zhen, went to Song's banquet at 10 PM on the 16th. Returning to his residence, he told reporters that the Jin army received 450,000 yuan, with 300,000 yuan for the reorganization and dismissal of four armies, and 150,000 yuan to close down the military agencies. Gao Guizi's reorganization and dismissal expenses are also included in this amount, which is significantly different. The amount to be given to each officer and soldier has not yet been determined. The Ministry of Finance's special commissioner, Jing Youyan, was refused a loan of 2 million yuan from the banking sector because the collateral was not very reliable. Deputy Commander Zhang is very anxious and willing to sign a guarantee. Each bank telegraphed its head office for instructions, and then received a reply stating that Zhang's signature was very good, but according to the general practice of bank loans, collateral is still required. Zhang again asked Special Commissioner Jing on the 16th to be responsible for the loan, saying that he must secure this loan before he can leave Tianjin. Song Zheyuan received 120,000 yuan for reorganization and dismissal, Pang Bingxun received 50,000 yuan, and Sun Dianying received 80,000 yuan. The commander-in-chief and deputy commander's joint credentials and the seals of the army and division commanders were received on the evening of the 16th. The order of the armies starts from the Third Army, because the Northeast already has two armies, namely the First Army of Yu Xuezhong and the Second Army of Wang Shuchang. The difference is that the credentials state "Appointing so-and-so as the commander of the nth Army of the Republic of China," without the "Northeast Army" designation. Song Zheyuan is the commander of the Third Army, and the rest, Xu Yongchang, Yang Aiyuan, and Fu Zuoyi, are the commanders of the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Armies. The credentials of the division commanders under the Fourth Army have been handed over to Ji Yiqiao, the reorganization and dismissal commissioner. He does not remember clearly. Pang Bingxun is the commander of the First Division of the Republic of China Army, and Sun Dianying is the commander of the Second Division. The reorganization of Gao Guizi's division and brigade will be discussed after the verification. The three cavalry divisions of the Jin army have been reduced to two brigades, and the ten artillery regiments will not be reduced but will be under the command of Deputy Commander Zhang. Regarding the subsidy after the elimination of customs duties in Shanxi Province, he met Song on the evening of the 16th, who agreed to plan comprehensively and promised to do his best to help with the rescue of Shanxi currency and will have a solution within days. (16th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>Taiyuan, the army commanders and Rong Honglu, etc., held a joint banquet at the Zhengda Hotel on the evening of the 15th, and reached a concrete agreement on the aftermath of the Jin military and political affairs. The army reduction has a military committee meeting, jointly organized by the Jin army commanders, and plans to nominate Rong Honglu as the chairman of the committee. (16th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>Taiyuan, a certain important person told reporters that the issue of the organization of the Jin-Sui Army has recently been discussed by the army commanders, and the specific method will have to wait for the Central Government to decide. Since the military power has been unified, the organization must have a procedure. This is something that cannot be changed in terms of the unified system and command. (16th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>Internal Affairs Conference Subgroup Reviews Proposals</h3>
<p>Nanjing, the subgroups of the Internal Affairs Conference, held review meetings on the 16th, both in the morning and afternoon.

<p>Nanjing, the four subgroups of the Internal Affairs Conference, namely Civil Affairs, Police Affairs, Land, and Etiquette and Customs, held review meetings on the 16th, both in the morning and afternoon, to discuss the proposals. (A) The Civil Affairs subgroup will first merge the proposals related to local autonomy, amending the county organization law, and training the people, which are of the same nature, and set them aside for review. Of those reviewed with results, 42 cases can be submitted for a report at the general meeting on the 17th. (B) The Police Affairs subgroup divided all the cases into ten small groups: (1) Organization, (2) Education, (3) Treatment, (4) Funding, (5) Household Registration, (6) Public Security, (7) Uniforms, (8) Judiciary, (9) Hygiene, (10) Opium Suppression. However, it was decided that the two small groups of Hygiene and Opium Suppression would be transferred to the Hygiene subgroup for review. (C) The Land subgroup completed the review of 25 cases. The content relates to detailed information such as surveying and land measurement. After formulating a plan, it will be submitted to the general meeting for a public decision and sent to the central land administration agency for reference or adoption. (D) The Etiquette and Customs subgroup merged and reviewed three cases, including the commendation regulations. For the cases where the heads of various agencies should be responsible for investigating and correcting the use of domestic goods by their staff and abolishing licentious temples and evil cults, it is planned to divide them into three stages: investigation, publicity, and implementation, proceeding in steps. (16th Special Telegram)</p>

<h3>Sun's Troops Temporarily Not Transferred to Jiangxi</h3>
<p>Nanjing, Chairman Chiang originally planned to transfer Sun Lianzhong's 26th Route Army to Jiangxi to assist in suppressing the communist bandits in Jiangxi Province due to their rampant activity. According to information from the army's office in Nanjing, the location of the army's defense is quite important. Moreover, the Jiangxi troops have recently been reinforced with the 52nd Division of Han Deqin and the 4th Division of Xu Tingyao. In fact, there is no need to reinforce the army, so the army will not be transferred to Jiangxi for the time being. (16th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>Nanjing, the first batch of Sun Lianzhong's troops arriving in Nanjing will cross the Yangtze River north tonight. The second batch will arrive in Nanjing tomorrow morning. (16th Special Telegram)</p>

<h3>Negotiation on Recovering Water Cables</h3>
<p>Ministry of Communications Consults with Pacific Company</p>
<p>Nanjing, the Ministry of Communications' International Telecommunications Negotiation Committee continued its meeting with representatives of the Pacific Water Cable Company on the 16th to discuss the details of the contract. The two sides discussed various prices and landing restriction rules for a long time. Since it was late, it was decided to discuss it again on the afternoon of the 17th. (16th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>Nanjing, the Fujian Provincial Telecommunications Workers' Union telegraphed the Ministry of Communications, stating that regarding the recovery of the Fuzhou-Xiamen-Gulou borrowed cables, the company has arbitrarily delayed, fearing that it may be plotting other schemes. It has taken decisive measures on the 1st, with the support of the local party and government agencies, and cut off the two borrowed cables. In addition, the Fujian Provincial Party Headquarters and the Provincial Government, considering that the Fuzhou Cangqianshan Daidong Company and the Xiamen Haihou Dabe Company have no debt disputes, also telegraphed the Ministry of Communications, ordering them to be revoked within a time limit. Furthermore, the Hebei Provincial Telecommunications Workers' Union also telegraphed the Central National Government and various ministries, requesting that the Shanghai-Yantai-Guyu cable and the Tianjin-Beijing reporting room be taken over quickly according to the original agreement.

<h3>Talks of British and American Loans</h3>
<p>British and American Banking Circles Deny It</p>
<p>Tokyo, regarding the news that Britain, America, and Canada will lend China 1 billion gold yuan, reliable sources said today that a powerful figure in the Morgan system said that he only learned of the loan from public rumors. He had not discussed it with anyone. Firstly, China has not yet reached the point of needing such a loan. Even if Britain, America, and Canada were willing to lend, who would provide the funds? American private capitalists are currently unable to lend. The American financial community also finds it difficult to agree with the Bittman's loan case. He denied this statement. British market bankers also said that this statement is unfounded. (16th Dentsu Telegram)</p>

<h3>Opium Prohibition Society Replies to Anti-Drug Society</h3>
<p>Nanjing, the Shanghai China National Anti-Drug Society inquired to the Central Opium Prohibition Society because newspapers reported that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued an English declaration stating that the government was preparing to manage opium trade and change the policy of complete prohibition. The Opium Prohibition Society replied to the society that the society is in charge of opium prohibition, and the administration should follow the government's policies and proceed in order. The government has long had laws and regulations for the implementation plan of opium prohibition administration. Since there is no change in the policy in the laws and regulations, there is no possibility of the administration violating the laws and regulations. The rumors are groundless and the facts are self-evident. As for the original meaning of the declaration of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, there may be errors in the translation. The former Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Health plan to establish a general management agency for narcotic drugs based on the Regulations for the Management of Narcotic Drugs, to handle the import, export, and transportation of narcotic drugs for legitimate medical and scientific purposes throughout the country, which is also not the so-called management of the national opium trade.

<h3>Talk of the World's Poisons</h3>
<p>If poisons are regarded as commodities that can be freely traded between countries, there is no need to say more. If, for humanitarian reasons, they are regarded as harmful things, then China is the country that suffers. All poisons are mostly produced, manufactured, promoted, and left over by other countries, and spread to China. Today, the world's groups that are nominally prohibiting poisons do not blame the countries that harm people with poisons, but blame the countries that are harmed by poisons, fearing that it is not harsh enough. How can this be called fair? Therefore, Dr. Wu Kaisheng protested against the report of the Far East Opium Smoking Investigation Team, stating that the Chinese government is currently trying to eliminate opium harm and crack down on domestic narcotics. While this should be stated in our country, those countries that produce, manufacture, and promote it should be ashamed of themselves.</p>
<p>Also, according to the director of the narcotics department of the Egyptian police, although the monitoring of factories manufacturing poisons in Europe is stricter than before, large quantities of heroin, cocaine, and hashish are shipped out of Constantinople. Constantinople is almost the largest source of illegal narcotics entering the East and the Americas. Also, according to a New York telegram, after the federal authorities checked for morphine on foreign ships, they immediately began an investigation. It is now known that there is an international drug smuggling organization led by two Parisians. It is said that the morphine smuggled into the United States last year was worth a total of 20 million yuan. It can be seen that there are many countries in Europe that profit from poisons. Merely blaming the countries that are harmed by poisons does not help the fundamental meaning of prohibiting poisons.</p>

<h3>Northern Altai Exploits Gold Mines</h3>
<p>Beiping, since the completion of the Western Shishi Railway along the border of Xinjiang, there have been 400,000 Russian immigrants and a German technician group of 2,500 people, who are distributed to various farms and factories along the border. In the Northern Altai gold mines, Russia sent more than 100 German technicians to supervise more than 40,000 people to excavate, producing more than 5,000 taels of pure gold per day. Now they are digging into the southern Altai in China. German technicians estimate that the gold production in the Southern Altai is three times higher than that in Russia, but no one goes to handle it, which is a pity. On the northern border of Outer Mongolia, Russia has newly established factories, using many German technicians. The Outer Mongolian government entrusts them to manufacture military weapons, plows, and other agricultural implements, all of which are engraved with the year number of the Outer Mongolian government, but in fact they are not made in Kulun.

<p>Chairman Briand Delivers Opening Remarks</p>
<p>Location of Disarmament Conference</p>
<p>Soviet Russia Objects to Geneva</p>
<p>Geneva, 16th (National Telegram) - Twenty-three foreign ministers from European nations, the prime minister of Bulgaria, and representatives from other smaller nations gathered at the League of Nations Hall this morning for the European Federation Conference. Chaired by French Foreign Minister Briand, the conference officially opened at 11:00 AM. It commenced with an hour of closed-door discussions, followed by the public opening of the conference hall. The audience was shoulder to shoulder, with journalists numbering no less than several hundred. At the public meeting, Briand delivered the opening remarks, stating that he hoped this year's alarming incidents would be fewer than in previous years. After a committee was appointed three months ago to specifically consider the issue of the European Federation, various countries experienced unprecedented commercial difficulties, leaving them little time for other matters. However, the deeper the commercial difficulties, the more urgent the necessity of the European Federation became. European governments must find ways to prevent this economic catastrophe, and the initiative of federation has been recognized as an urgent matter along with the key issue of European peace. He expressed the hope that this conference would gather the opinions and information of various countries on this issue, and consider them, so that European peace and federation could be achieved step by step. Following Briand's speech, German Foreign Minister Curtius stated that Germany was willing to fully assist in the achievement of European peace and cooperation based on the principle of equality. Germany was among the most affected by economic difficulties, and therefore would gladly follow any means of relief. Finally, Dutch Finance Minister Colijn spoke, stating that they should pull European countries out of national parochialism and move towards the goal of a united Europe. The biggest problems facing the world and Europe today cannot be solved without the sincere cooperation of all countries.</p>
<p>Moscow, 15th (National Telegram) - The Soviet Russian government has sent identical notes through its ambassadors to various countries, requesting that all participating countries in the upcoming disarmament conference have completely equal rights. The chairman should be elected by the conference and not be appointed by the League of Nations. Representatives from countries that have taken a significantly negative attitude towards disarmament at the preparatory meetings, and countries with highly developed arms manufacturing industries, should not be elected as chairman of the conference. Furthermore, Geneva is not favored as the location of the conference, as it should be held in a country that has diplomatic relations with all participating countries. Since Switzerland and Czechoslovakia have not officially recognized Soviet Russia, Soviet Russia does not favor Geneva. Berlin and the Swedish capital are considered the most suitable.</p>

<h3>俄報評論國際對華借欵</h3>
<p>Russian Newspaper Comments on International Loans to China</p>
<p>British Indian Sales Policy Promotes Silver Depreciation</p>
<p>Pittman Issues Three Proposals</p>
<p>Moscow, 15th (National Telegram) - A Russian newspaper commented on the proposal for international loans to China, stating that it was first proposed by American silver mining capitalists, whose initial intention was to absorb hundreds of millions of ounces of raw silver in order to save the drastic decline in silver prices. However, such a huge amount of international loans would lead to the internationalization of China's finances, and the United States, as the initiator and leader of the new international silver syndicate, would greatly consolidate its power in China. Therefore, the Americans' attempt to provide this loan is simply to transform China into a financial colony, which will inevitably be fiercely opposed by other imperialist countries. At the same time, it can be seen that the imperialists' interference in China is becoming more active.</p>
<p>Washington, 15th (Reuters) - Senator Pittman today blamed the low silver prices on the British policy of selling Indian silver bullion on the market. Pittman is the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee studying the causes of the low silver prices. It is said that the committee's report will advocate (1) the cessation of negotiations on the British Indian silver sales policy, (2) silver loans to China, and (3) a study of future international conferences on the use of silver as currency and its exchange value. Pittman also said that Minister Song of the Chinese Ministry of Finance's statement that China is unwilling to accept silver loans and that those who want to lend silver to China are American silver marketeers seeking to dump their surplus silver on China, he did not see anything in it that opposed the committee's plan. He believes that Minister Song's words likely mean that what China is most concerned about is actions that can curb the continued decline in silver prices and restore the purchasing power of silver. He fully agrees with Minister Song that if the British Indian silver sales policy remains unchanged, speculators in various silver markets will continue to sell silver and promote its decline. India has hundreds of millions of silver coins. If Britain does not announce the cessation of its sales policy, there will be no hope for the silver market. Chinese speculators know this, so they are selling off in droves, which is why silver prices are so low.</p>
<h3>印度圓桌會議</h3>
<p>Indian Round Table Conference</p>
<p>Holds Plenary Committee</p>
<p>Bombay Textile Mills Close</p>
<p>In Sympathy with Demonstrations</p>
<p>London, 15th (Reuters) - The Indian Round Table Conference held a plenary committee meeting today. The Prince of Bhopal said that the federation proposal, which the Simon Commission and the Indian government considered to be bleak and untimely, has now become a reality. Britain's implementation of the fundamental aspiration of equality and fairness is commendable. It is hoped that the Indian people will abandon their racial differences. India is now eager to hear British Prime Minister MacDonald's words of lovingly and kindly uniting Britain and India forever, and hopes that the British Prime Minister will not disappoint them. The chief representative of the Muslims, Aga Khan, was absent due to illness and had his speech read by another representative. It stated that if the Muslims do not receive full protection, there can be no progress in the provinces or at the center. Speakers for the non-Brahmin castes welcomed the report of the conference, promised to support the implementation of its proposals, and hoped that the disputes between Hindus and Muslims could be resolved after returning home. Sir Chintamani of the Indian Liberal Party spoke, expressing disagreement with the reservations on finance, currency, and exchange rates, but still supported the report. Keir, the representative of the non-official Europeans, also welcomed the report, but said that the future legal, educational, and commercial status of Europeans must be fully guaranteed. Sir Sapru said that the fundamental principles of the report were very sound. Jayakar also agreed with the general principles of the report, but considered the financial safeguards to be excessive, and said that he also agreed with the reserved issues of national defense and foreign affairs, but the possibility of immediately transferring these issues should be further studied. Sapru quite agreed with this proposal, and Chintamani said that there should be a provision for the transitional period.</p>
<p>Bombay, 16th (Reuters) - As a result of yesterday's clashes between police and demonstrators, about a hundred people were injured and hospitalized. Almost all Bombay textile mills were closed yesterday, as 140,000 factory workers went on strike for a day to express sympathy with the demonstrators. The authorities deployed a total of 5,000 police officers, in addition to two companies of soldiers from the East Lancashire Regiment. The Bombay government had issued a warning in advance that people should not engage in any activities regarding the execution of criminals in Poona, but the public ignored it. This demonstration was organized by the All-India Congress Struggle Committee.</p>
<p>Chaiawaddy, Lower Burma, 15th (Reuters) - Fifty bandits, wielding long knives, rushed into the Kyaukpyaung railway station at midnight, surrounded the room of the Bengali stationmaster. The stationmaster's wife offered valuables to avoid harming her husband. The bandits took the valuables, broke open the safe, cut the telephone wires, and destroyed all the items in the station. Finally, they dragged the stationmaster to the platform and hacked him into several pieces, ignoring his wife's pleas. Other station staff members took the opportunity to escape, avoiding harm. After receiving the alarm, the authorities dispatched an armored train, but the bandits had disappeared. The government is now preparing to suppress them severely. Nighttime mail trains passing through the affected area are now led by armored trains.</p>
<h3>台督府幹部總辭職</h3>
<p>The Entire Staff of the Taiwan Governor-General's Office Resigns</p>
<p>Opposition Parties Attack Government</p>
<p>Adding Another Excellent Piece of Information</p>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Electric Communication) - Yesterday, Governor-General Ishizuka of Taiwan visited Prime Minister-Acting Bihari, and Minister of Colonial Affairs Matsuda also arrived, and formally submitted his resignation. Prime Minister-Acting Bihari, after the regular cabinet meeting today, immediately reported to the Emperor tomorrow afternoon and obtained his approval. The successor will be appointed to the current Director-General of the Kanto Prefecture, Ota. It is heard that due to the resignation of Governor-General Rightzuka, the Chief Secretary of the Taiwan Governor's Office, Hitoshi, the Chief of the Police Bureau, Ishii, and the Governor of Taichung, Mizukoshi, have also decided to resign jointly. The reason why the staff of the Taiwan Governor's Office made this move is that Governor-General Ishizuka originally intended to resign himself, so he came to Tokyo to negotiate follow-up measures, etc. Unexpectedly, the government had already decided on his successor, which he felt unpleasant. After the government explained various matters, it still ended with his resignation. However, the Chief Secretary Hitoshi also resigned as a result, which the government did not expect at first, so it was quite embarrassed. As a result, the Musha Incident became more serious. The House of Representatives and the House of Lords believe that since the government has acknowledged the failure of the management policy, it is only natural to dismiss all the staff of the Governor-General's Office, and it is only natural for Minister of Colonial Affairs Matsuda to resign to take responsibility. It is determined to pursue Minister of Colonial Affairs Matsuda's responsibility in the parliament.</p>

<h3>Foreign Minister Wang's Speech on Receiving the Tianjin Belgian Concession and Stating Future Aspirations</h3>
<p>After arriving in Tianjin, Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting attended the ceremony for the return of the Belgian Concession on the 15th. In the afternoon, he received a warm welcome from the citizens of Tianjin. Wang delivered a detailed speech about the process of recovering the Belgian Concession and his aspirations for the future. The following is a transcript of his speech: "Based on the late Premier's instructions, the Ministry is actively seeking the abolition of unequal treaties. We have decided on the following steps: (1) to remove economic constraints, namely tariff autonomy; (2) to remove judicial constraints, namely the recovery of judicial power; (3) to remove all other administrative and military constraints, namely the recovery of concessions, leased territories, and inland navigation rights, and the withdrawal of foreign troops, etc. Since beginning our efforts in the 17th year [of the Republic], all new tariff treaties concluded with various countries have come into full effect by November 18 of the 19th year [of the Republic]. Economic constraints were thus completely removed on that day. Regarding the issue of judicial power, on December 28 of the previous year, the National Government announced that it would begin abolishing the consular jurisdiction of various countries in China from January 1 of the 19th year [of the Republic]. The attitudes of major European and American powers have also become extremely clear recently. This issue will be fundamentally resolved in the shortest possible period. With economic and judicial constraints being completely removed, our efforts should naturally be focused on the administrative front, and the most important task should be the recovery of concessions and leased territories. The recovery of concessions and leased territories in China by various countries did not begin today. However, the recovery of concessions in the past, such as the Russian, German, and Austrian concessions in Tianjin and the Russian and German concessions in Hankou, was based either on severance of diplomatic relations or on military force. Since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, the signing of agreements to recover concessions through peaceful bilateral negotiations began with the Belgian Concession in Tianjin. These bilateral negotiations began on June 17 of the 18th year [of the Republic] and lasted for approximately two and a half months until the agreement was signed on August 31 of the same year. It was stipulated that the agreement would come into effect from the date on which the two governments mutually notified each other of its ratification. Our government ratified the agreement on November 7 of the 18th year [of the Republic]. The Belgian side's ratification document was sent last winter. Now, the instruments of ratification have been exchanged, and it has been decided that our side will take over the concession on the 15th of this month. Thus, the land in the Hedong section of Tianjin, which was leased by our country to Belgium in the 27th year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty (1902), has finally been returned to its original owner. Although the Tianjin Belgian Concession has an area of less than two square li and a population of less than two thousand, and its material relationship is not very important, it is the only exclusive concession that Belgium has in our territory. Now, the Belgian government and people are willing to return this concession to China. We should accept their spirit of friendship and their goodwill in assisting China to restore its administrative power with utmost sincerity. We firmly believe that many countries with relations with China, who are willing to uphold justice and renounce their privileges, are not limited to Belgium alone. I cannot help but feel this. In the past, the Qing dynasty was either deceived or oppressed regarding foreign affairs, leading to the signing of various unequal treaties. Today, with the recovery of the Belgian Concession, one of these scars of inequality has been erased. We can take some comfort in this. However, in handling diplomacy, it is important to have a definite procedure and, more importantly, a thorough determination. The steps to abolish unequal treaties are as mentioned above. As of today, in addition to the Belgian Concession currently being received, the British concessions in Zhenjiang and Xiamen, as well as the Weihaiwei leased territory in Shandong, have been completely recovered. The Xiamen Kulangsu International Settlement, the Hankou Japanese Concession and the Hankou French Concession are in the process of being recovered. The recovery of all other concessions and leased territories will be carried out gradually, taking into account the circumstances, so that after tariff autonomy and the recovery of judicial power, the administrative constraints we have suffered for more than eighty years will be completely overthrown and cleared away. After all concessions and leased territories have been recovered, our country will spare no effort to protect the lives and property of all people, both Chinese and foreign, within those boundaries. The result of recovering concessions and leased territories will only increase our country's responsibilities, while it will not have the slightest impact on foreigners. This is what we hope people at home and abroad will understand. The Ministry is responsible for negotiation and struggle, but the country is currently facing difficulties and still relies on collective strength. Towards friendly foreign countries and their people, we should base our actions on the spirit of equality and mutual respect, without being constrained by prejudice or narrow-mindedness. We should always and everywhere demonstrate the attitude of a great Chinese nation, so that we can unite internally and uplift ourselves externally, and achieve the great accomplishment of abolishing unequal treaties as soon as possible."</p>

<h3>He Chengjun and Others Travel to Beijing Together</h3>
<p>Hankou dispatch: He Chengjun, Director of the Wuhan Garrison Headquarters, on the 7th of this month, received a telegram from Commander-in-Chief Chiang, ordering him to go to Hunan with Wang Jinyu, Supervisor of Bandit Suppression and Rural Pacification in the border areas of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi; Xia Douyin, Commander-in-Chief of the 21st Route Army; Liu Wendao, Mayor of Hankou, and others to inspect Hunan and to discuss bandit suppression matters with He Jian, Commander-in-Chief of the 4th Route Army. He and the others arrived in Changsha on the 8th, representing Commander-in-Chief Chiang, to慰勞 the various bandit suppression armies, inspected the Changsha Fortress, and convened a military conference on bandit suppression at the headquarters of the 4th Route Army, attended by officers above the rank of brigade commander. A detailed plan was determined for bandit suppression matters. On the 11th, he and Wang, Xia, Liu, and others returned to Hankou by special train. At this time, banditry in Jiangxi Province was rampant again, and the armies suppressing the Communists in the Donggu area had not yet achieved rapid success. He, who was responsible for supervising the suppression in the three provinces, and having returned from his inspection of Hunan, knew that the main force of the Communist army was concentrated in Jiangxi, and that bandit suppression could not be discussed until the main force of the bandit army in Jiangxi was resolved. Therefore, he decided to go to Beijing by plane on the 15th with Wang Jinyu and Xia Douyin to request a fundamental solution from Commander-in-Chief Chiang, to report on the recent bandit suppression situation in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi and the inspection of Hunan, and to submit for approval the recent plan for Hunan and the allocation of funds. Incidentally, he would also request instructions on the political affairs of Hubei Province and the salt tax surcharge. Because He Qiyang, President of the Hubei Higher Court, was holding a supplementary swearing-in ceremony on the same day, He, representing the Judicial Yuan as the supervisor, was slightly delayed, so he changed to the Sanbei Company's Xinning Shao wheel, accompanied by Wang Jinyu, Xia Douyin, He Guoguang, and several attendants, and one telecommunications officer, and set sail eastward at 12:00 noon. Those who came to the dock to see him off included Xu Yuanquan, Supervisor of Bandit Suppression in the border areas of Sichuan, Hunan, and Hubei; Xiao Zhichu, Commander of the 44th Division; Liu Wendao, Mayor of Hankou; Zhang Guanshi, Director of the Department of Finance; Fang Dazhi, Director of the Department of Construction; Huang Jianzhong, Director of the Department of Education, and more than a hundred others. During He's stay in Beijing, the affairs of the Garrison Headquarters will be temporarily handled by Chief of Staff Zhu Chuanjing, the affairs of the headquarters of the 3rd Army Corps will be handled by Chief of Staff Chen Guangzu, and the affairs of the Hubei Provincial Government will be handled by Secretary-General Hua Jueming. He is expected to stay in Beijing for three days and then return to Hankou. (January 15)</p>
<h3>Shanxi Province Urgently Needs Post-Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>Military and Political Affairs are at a Standstill, Disaster Victims Fill Pingyao</p>
<p>New News of Feng and Xue, Financial Changes</p>
<p>Taiyuan Dispatch: The post-disaster situation in Shanxi is becoming increasingly serious. Troops are stationed in various counties, and most of them are requisitioning supplies locally. The supply of grain and fodder goes without saying, and even shoes and socks are being made by the people according to the number required. At a time when resources are exhausted, the people are unable to save themselves, let alone care for this large army of more than 200,000. In addition, in the past day or two, there has been a heavy snowfall and a sudden change in the weather. A considerable number of poor people have been frozen to death. After Shang Zhen, Xu Yongchang, and others were summoned to Tianjin, military officers and the majority of the people in Shanxi hoped that a concrete solution would be found as soon as possible to resolve the situation satisfactorily and provide post-disaster relief. However, after Shang and others left, a month has passed, and there is still no news of their return to Shanxi. In order to seek an early solution and to reassure the military, the military officers jointly requested Gu Renfa to go to Beijing to personally present the plight to the central government. Many officers are still waiting for news in Pingyao. The provincial government and various departments have only been carrying out routine business in recent days, and everything is virtually at a standstill. Provincial Chairman Shang Zhen and Director of Finance Qiu Zengyi are in Tianjin on official business, and Director of Agriculture and Mines Geng Guiting and Director of Industry and Commerce Li Shangren have also gone to Beiping one after another. The headquarters is currently being maintained by Zhou Dai, but Zhou is often at home, and nothing can be done. Since the order to abolish lijin [transit tax] arrived, the Shuheguan Zhengtai Cargo Tax Bureau and the Shanxi North Joint Collection Bureau have stopped collecting taxes in accordance with the order and are actively handling the winding up. Disaster relief officials in Pingyao feel that the area is increasingly full of disaster victims. From Beiping and Tianjin alone, approximately 16,000 officials of all ranks have been sent back, and combined with those in Hebei Province and Chahar District, the number is at least over 20,000. Given the current situation in Shanxi Province, not only is it impossible to resettle these people, but even the original staff of the various customs offices in Pingyao have been repeatedly laid off. Therefore, maintaining the disaster relief officials alone is very difficult. Xue Dubi, who has followed Feng Yuxiang for the longest time, is still in a private residence in Pingyao, reading books behind closed doors. He refuses to see anyone who visits. According to some sources, Feng Yuxiang disguised himself and left Pingyao four days before the Lunar New Year. It is certain that he was hiding in a small shoe store in the provincial capital. His current whereabouts are still unknown and cannot be confirmed. The former officials of the provincial party headquarters have shown signs of activity. Members of the Executive Committee, Han Xisheng and Zhao Shanru, have returned to Pingyao from Tianjin to arrange everything. It is said that all the members will be able to return to Pingyao and start work within half a month. The price of provincial currency has not changed much. One silver dollar can currently be exchanged for two dollars and sixty cents. A few days ago, it once rose to three dollars. After investigation, it was learned that a certain magnate withdrew several million dollars from a Japanese bank. The Japanese merchants took the opportunity to buy up Shanxi currency to meet the demand, causing a sudden surge in price. This information was obtained from the financial sector and cannot be confirmed. The soaring prices of goods in Pingyao continue to rise unabated. In addition to the fact that trains, telegraphs, telephones, electricity, and post offices have switched to collecting in silver dollars, the Shanxi Hotel and various foreign merchants have also switched to silver dollars. Although the general price of goods is still based on the provincial currency, the actual value is even higher than when silver dollars were commonly used. Taiyuan has certainly entered its most difficult period. (January 9)</p>
<h3>Harbin Conference on Restoring Prosperity</h3>
<p>Joint Meeting of Seventeen Organizations</p>
<p>Resolved to Purchase Soybeans and Issue Paper Money</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: This afternoon (the 9th), various Harbin agencies and legal entities held a joint conference at the Binjiang Chamber of Commerce to rescue the market and commerce. Those in attendance included Zhong Yu, Director of the Binjiang Municipal Preparatory Office; Li Keyuan, County Magistrate of Binjiang County; Gao Qidong, Director of the Binjiang Public Security Bureau; the heads of the six banks, namely China, Jiaotong, Bianye, Dongsansheng, Yongheng, and Guangxin; and the chairmen of the eight chambers of commerce, namely the Harbin Chamber of Commerce, the Binjiang Chamber of Commerce, the Grain Trade Association, the Oil Mill Association, the General Merchandise Association, the Flour Mill Association, the Grain Exchange, and the Money Trade Association, totaling twenty-five representatives from seventeen organizations. The meeting began at around 12:00 noon to jointly discuss plans to maintain commerce and restore Harbin's prosperity. The key results were three: (1) to organize an institution similar to the Anglo-American state-owned bank consortium to purchase soybeans, a special product of northern Manchuria, and raise sugar prices, so as to indirectly activate the market; (2) to issue 50 million yuan in paper money that is specially used for purchasing soybeans and that can be circulated and cashed throughout the three northeastern provinces. The paper money will be distributed by various banks. Prior to this, representatives will be recommended by various Harbin organizations and agencies to contact the government of the three northeastern provinces. In the future, the agency for purchasing soybeans will be supervised by representatives from the provincial government and various Harbin organizations. If there are any losses, they will be borne by the governments of the three provinces. The governments of the three provinces will be responsible for issuing the paper money. The soybeans purchased by the company will be the direct guarantee for the provincial government and the indirect guarantee for the paper money. The reason why the amount is set at 50 million yuan is that only soybeans have the opportunity to be sold abroad among the grains in northern Manchuria. The soybean production is about 250,000 train cars (about 1.3 million tons). In addition to the 20,000-30,000 train cars that have been sold since the market opened, there are still 200,000 train cars to be purchased. Every 100,000 train cars requires 10 million yuan, so it is necessary to prepare double the funds; (3) to recommend the two chambers of commerce in Daoli and Daowai, the Grain Trade Association, the Money Trade Association, the Flour Mill Association, the Oil Mill Association, and the Grain Exchange as drafters. On the morning of the 10th, at 11:00, they will meet at the Binjiang Chamber of Commerce to jointly draft. It is scheduled that on the 11th, the original groups will still convene at the Chamber of Commerce to conduct a detailed discussion in accordance with the charter. As soon as the charter is drafted, representatives from each of the seventeen agencies and organizations will be recommended to go to Liaoning to contact the authorities. The meeting adjourned at around 3:00 p.m. This matter is related to the prosperity and decline of Harbin, so various agencies and organizations are proceeding actively and dare not slack off. Today, when people in the market heard this news, soybeans rose from seven cents to nine cents per bushel (30 catties), and the exchange rate rose from 14 yuan to 17 yuan per 100 yuan. (9th)</p>
<h3>Liaoning Agricultural and Commercial Loans to be Issued</h3>
<p>Issuance of 20 Million Yuan in Remittance Vouchers</p>
<p>Shenyang Dispatch: Due to the impact of floods and the gold standard in Liaoning, the market has been sluggish and farmers and businesses are struggling. Even at an interest rate of eight percent per month in the outer counties, there are no funds available for loans. The financial exhaustion is evident. Previously, representatives from ten counties in western Liaoning came to the province to petition. The provincial government immediately agreed to find a way to provide relief. The presidents of the Chambers of Commerce and Education were appointed to go to Tianjin to meet with Deputy Commander-in-Chief Zhang. As a result of the discussions, it was decided that the Three Northeastern Provinces Official Silver Bureau would issue 20 million yuan in remittance vouchers (i.e., Feng Dayang vouchers converted to silver dollars at the current exchange rate). On December 26, 19, the provincial government formulated twelve articles of the "Outline of the Method for Agricultural and Commercial Loans in Liaoning Province" and submitted it to the provincial committee meeting for resolution and approval. It was stipulated that agricultural and commercial loans must be secured with appropriate collateral and reliable guarantees, with a monthly interest rate of one percent. The provincial government will organize a management committee to be responsible for supervision and correction, and may send personnel to conduct on-site inspections if necessary. Loan offices will be established in various cities and counties to be responsible for introduction, investigation, and collection. If there are inaccuracies in the collateral or incomplete collection, the personnel in charge of each office will be jointly responsible. Subsequently, the "Regulations for Agricultural and Commercial Loans in Liaoning Province" and the "Organizational Regulations for the Management Committee for Agricultural and Commercial Loans in Liaoning Province," and the "Regulations for Agricultural and Commercial Loan Offices in Various Cities and Counties of Liaoning Province" were all passed by the Provincial Committee on the 7th of this month and officially announced and implemented on the 8th. Regarding loan procedures, the Management Committee and the Official Silver Bureau will jointly allocate funds according to the situation in each county. The loan offices in each city and county will be responsible for the investigation. It is stipulated that the maximum loan for farmers shall not exceed 2,000 yuan, and the maximum loan for businesses shall not exceed 3,000 yuan. The Official Silver Bureau headquarters and its branches will be the agencies for handling agricultural and commercial loans in each city and county. In places where there are no branches, the headquarters may send special personnel to handle the loans, but loans shall not be granted directly without the introduction of the local loan office. Borrowers shall submit their existing real estate deeds or personal property receipts, and other related documents to the loan office for verification of the value. Then, together with the loan agreement, they shall be submitted to the Official Silver Bureau for verification. If there are no errors, the Bureau shall pay the loan amount directly. The collateral shall be kept by the Bureau, and a receipt for the collateral shall be issued. When the loan is due, the borrower shall first report to the loan office for registration, and then pay the principal and interest directly to the Official Silver Bureau for verification and collection. After the Bureau has cleared the payment, it shall return the collateral and notify the loan office to close the account. The provincial government has now distributed the various regulations to each city and county for announcement and is preparing to stamp the remittance vouchers for distribution to various counties. All loan offices have been ordered to actively prepare for organization and establishment and must implement the loan to the people by mid-month at the latest. (January 11)</p>
<h3>Shandong Business Tax Preparatory Committee Established</h3>
<p>Will Start with Investigating Business Conditions</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: Since January 1, Shandong Province has implemented the abolition of lijin [transit tax], reducing revenue by 500,000 yuan per month. Government expenses are almost impossible to maintain. The only item that can offset this is the business tax. Therefore, the provincial government has established a business tax preparatory committee. Wang Xiangrong, Director of the Department of Finance, Wang Fangting, Director of the Department of Agriculture and Mines, and Xin Baoding, Chairman of the Jinan General Chamber of Commerce, are ex officio members. Tian Lianzhong, former Superintendent of the Linqing Customs, Zhang Shaotang, Secretary-General of the Provincial Government, Weng Zhiquan, Secretary Director of the Department of Finance, and Ren Yueying are hired as members. The committee is located at the former site of the Jinan Finance Committee. The inaugural meeting was held at 2:00 p.m. this afternoon (the 12th). Wang Xiangrong, the chairman, reported on the preparatory process, stating that the abolition of lijin has caused financial difficulties for the province, so the business tax is being actively prepared. However, the matter is new and the procedures are difficult, so it was decided to start with investigation. Zhang Shaotang then spoke. After the speech, a group photo was taken and the meeting adjourned. The first regular meeting was then held. The attending members were Wang Xiangrong, Zhang Shaotang, Weng Zhiquan, Ren Yueying, and Tian Lianzhong. Those who attended as observers were Secretary Director Wang Zhaolin, Director of the First Section Zhang Zanxu, Director of the Second Section Cui Xinchu, and Director of the Third Section Yu Baosheng. After the meeting began, the first item discussed was the election of the chairman and standing committee members. Wang Xiangrong was elected as the chairman, and Tian Lianzhong, Ren Yueying, and Weng Zhiquan were elected as standing committee members. Next, the meeting rules and operating rules were approved. Then, Weng Zhiquan proposed that since the Shandong business tax is new, there is no basis for the total revenue for this year and the proposed tax rate regulations. An investigation should be conducted first to facilitate the process. A business survey form and application form have been drafted. A vote was requested on whether or not to approve the proposal, and it was approved as presented. The content of the proposal was that the six most prosperous commercial areas in Shandong Province are Jinan, Yantai, Qingdao, Zhoucun, Jining, and Weixian, and they will be the areas with the highest business tax revenue in the future. One or two people will be sent to each area for investigation. For the other counties, one person will be sent to investigate every three counties. The investigation procedure is to first issue a business declaration to the merchants, asking them to fill in their business situation and the amount of capital. After filling it in, the investigators will review it together with the county government. If there is no false reporting, then the tax amount will be determined based on the information. The meeting adjourned at 4:00 p.m. It is said that the central government stipulates that business tax should be levied based on business income. Shandong Province finds this method difficult to investigate, and the province is facing financial difficulties, so the tax needs to be implemented urgently. In the future, the tax may be levied based on the amount of capital first. (12th)</p>
<h3>Recent Military Affairs in Fujian Province</h3>
<p>Headquarters of the Marine Corps Abolished</p>
<p>Changes in the Provincial Garrison</p>
<p>Ye Chunsheng Executed</p>
<p>Liu's Division to Enter Jiangxi to Suppress Communists</p>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: Chen Jiliang, Commander-in-Chief of the Navy and Marine Corps, recently resigned from all his concurrent posts. Yang Shuzhuang's title of Army Commander-in-Chief has been revoked by the National Government. The post of Commander-in-Chief of the Navy and Marine Corps cannot be retained alone. Chen has been ordered to continue serving as Commander of the First Fleet and not to decline resolutely. As for the headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief, the handover is being expedited. As for the issue of the jurisdiction of the First and Second Brigades of the Marine Corps, there are several options: direct jurisdiction by the Navy, command by the Security Department established by the Provincial Government, or merging them into one division with Lin Zhiyuan as the division commander.</p>
<p>After Liu's division went upstream, only Li Huan's regiment remained in Fuzhou to镇摄. Recently, Yang Shuzhuang telegraphed that the defense areas of each army would be slightly changed. It is said that the entire training regiment stationed in Quanzhou will be transferred to the province. The First Battalion of Liang Jichuan's troops, originally stationed in Yongtai, and the anti-bandit commander Huang Bingwu's troops in the northwest township will be transferred to Quanzhou. The defense of Yongtai will be taken over by Huang Maohe's regiment of the First Brigade of the Land Army. A detachment will be stationed in Minqing by Liu's division. Xue Ying's unit of Huang's troops has already set off for Yongtai. The training regiment will arrive in Quanzhou after Liang's and Huang's troops arrive in Quanzhou, and will arrive in the provincial capital in about a week.</p>
<p>After the Communist bandits in Jiangxi Province were severely suppressed by the army, they fled to Ningdu and Ninghua. The civil defense office dispatched civil defense teams to intercept them and requested that Zhang's division dispatch troops to jointly suppress them. Zhang replied that his troops were currently suppressing Communists in Longyan and Yongding and could not take care of both, so he sent a letter to the provincial government requesting that it dispatch troops to jointly defend and suppress them with the civil defense teams. Qiu Tiwu, a member of the Longyan and Tingzhou Association for Saving His Hometowns, also telegraphed the provincial government, requesting that it dispatch capable troops to defend the area and intercept the remaining Communists fleeing into Fujian. The provincial government replied by telegram that it had made concrete plans for suppressing Communists in western Fujian and that Jiangxi had dispatched a large army to intercept them.</p>
<p>Ye Chunsheng, the leader of the Jian'ou Civil Defense Force, was previously incorporated into the Third Detachment by Liu Zongyi of the Provincial Police Brigade after capturing He Jinbiao. Recently, the leaders of the civil defense forces of the five counties stated that since Ye's troops were originally civil defense forces, they should be assigned to the five counties. When Lu's troops were transferred, Ye led his troops into Jian'ou. When Lin Pingzhou of the Marine Corps entered Jian'ou, he withdrew, but was still in the border area of Jian'ou, harassing the area. Lin received a secret report and lured and arrested Ye. He telegraphed Liu Heding to report. Liu replied by telegram that he should be executed on the spot. Lin executed Ye on the 7th after receiving the telegram.</p>
<p>After Liu's division went to Yanping, the National Government strictly ordered the division to depart for Ruijin and Shicheng by a specified date to coordinate the suppression of the Communist bandits. Currently, one regiment of Liu Shangzhi's brigade of the division has arrived in Shunchang. The provincial government telegraphed the regiment yesterday, ordering it to quickly leave Taijian and head towards Shicheng. Liu also telegraphed Zhou Zhiqun's and Lu Xingbang's brigades, urging them to advance towards Ruijin and Shicheng, and decided to personally lead Chen Naitai's troops to advance and encircle them.

<h3>Jiading</h3>
<p>Continued News of the Massacre of the Green Gang Members. Regarding the case where Green Gang members were rounded up by the garrisoned road protection soldiers during a gathering at the Yang Wang Temple in Nanxiang on the evening of December 12th of last year, resulting in a tragic incident, it has recently been learned that the Civil Affairs Department has strictly ordered County Magistrate Chen to swiftly arrest and bring the gang leader, Zhou Xiuqing, to justice. Hua Shijun, the head of the town's Public Security Bureau, has been dismissed from his post and replaced by Pan Jie, a graduate of the Police Academy. A strict investigation will be conducted to determine if there was any situation of condoning or protecting wrongdoing. The captured criminals were also jointly requested for release by the town's merchants to the Military Law Office of the Capital Garrison Command, but this was not approved. The Civil Affairs Department has transferred the case to the command to be sent back to the original county for interrogation.</p>
<p>Water Police Capture Bandits. Since the second half of last year, theft cases have occurred frequently in the southwest and southeast townships of this county, but none have been solved.

He immediately ordered his men to go there and, with the assistance of the French police, searched house number 17 in the lane. The main offender escaped and was not caught, but one bandit, Xu Qiuquan, was arrested on the spot and escorted back to Jiading yesterday. The bandit was extremely cunning and only admitted to trafficking in people. He was immediately sent to the judiciary for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>News of a Market Strike in Xinzhuang Town. Recently, the Xinzhuang Town District Office sent a letter to the patrol officer of the Public Security Sub-bureau, requesting that he summon and pursue the tea houses that owed donations due to unpaid donations. It is said that the amount of donations owed was about five yuan. The tea house owners were greatly angered. The people summoned were subsequently released on bail by the standing committee of the Chamber of Commerce. The tea houses then went on strike together, and tea drinkers were left wandering on the streets. Soon, other shops also followed suit and went on strike, and reported everything to the county government. The town's Chamber of Commerce immediately convened an emergency meeting to discuss everything, hoping to persuade the merchants to resume business.</p>
<p>The County Party Headquarters Ordered to Investigate. The Reorganization Committee of the County Party Headquarters recently received an order from the province to investigate the various situations of various agencies, organizations, and party members, and issued an investigation form to Songjiang. After receiving the order, the committee immediately assigned responsibilities for the investigation.

<p>A Case of Extortionist Arrested. Nan Dian Shan Ma Peng and other places in Songpu have been the areas most plagued by bandits, and the people have been living in fear for more than a day. Recently, those with a little savings have received extortion letters from bandits, demanding large sums of money. Chen Rongchu, the captain of the County Police Squad, has arrested Zhang Mengguan, alias Zhongkai, of Ma Peng, who specializes in writing extortion letters. Zhang once served as an executive committee member of the Iron Industry Association in Shanghai and was active in the reaction. After his failure, he returned to his hometown and served as an executive committee member in Li Yi'e's unit, seizing the Ma Peng Security Group's weapons and burning down the New Town, both of which he commanded.</p>
<p>Another Theft Case in Xinzhuang Town. Theft cases have been occurring frequently in Xinzhuang Town recently, and almost none have been solved. In the first half of this month alone, two theft cases occurred. Yesterday morning at about 1:00 a.m., five bandits suddenly came to the home of Sheng Jinhe, a villager in the Chun Shen Temple, Henan area, about a mile away from the town. They climbed over the roof into the house, speaking in the local dialect, and holding out handguns and other iron implements, threatened them to remain silent. After searching for clothing and ornaments, they were still not satisfied and used a Western candle flame to burn Sheng's daughter-in-law's lower body, demanding that she reveal where the money was hidden. After searching for about an hour, they left with their loot. It is said that they looted more than one hundred yuan in cash and clothing worth about three hundred yuan. He immediately reported the incident to the Fifth Sub-bureau of the Xinzhuang Public Security Bureau, requesting an investigation.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>"Beat Injustice" Newspaper Editor Escorted to Court. The Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau arrested Wang Liwu, an editor of the "Beat Injustice" newspaper, on December 25, 1920, on suspicion of being a reactionary. He was immediately escorted to the Shanghai Local Court. Yesterday (the 16th), the Shanghai Local Court sent police to escort the prisoner Wang, along with the case file, to the Suzhou High Court and sent him to the Sisi Qianwei Detention Center. Electric Request to Exempt National Product Advertising Tax. The Wu County Chamber of Commerce stated that, according to the South Ocean Brothers Tobacco Company in Suzhou, Shanghai newspapers reported that the company's advertising in Wuxi was free of charge. The Wuxi Property Management Conference ruled that although the company was a national product, its nature was similar to entertainment and leisure and could not be compared with legitimate national product daily necessities. A letter was immediately sent to the county and then submitted to the Department of Finance for verification and decision. Suzhou newspapers also reported that the Wuxi Chamber of Commerce had decided to follow the Shanghai Municipal Public Utilities Bureau's Provisional Measures for National Product Advertising Tax and still levy 80% of the advertising tax on the product. The county Chamber of Commerce believes that national product advertising tax was previously exempted by order of the Executive Yuan, how can the Yuan's order be changed? The County Chamber of Commerce believes that national product advertising tax has been exempted in each county. Yesterday, it sent separate telegrams to the Ministry of Industry and the Jiangsu Provincial Government, requesting that all counties be ordered to quickly comply with the Yuan's order and uniformly exempt national product advertising tax to promote national products. Case of Accusation Against Judges Submitted to the Ministry for Verification. Previously, Song Lian submitted a petition to the Ministry of Justice, accusing Huang Bingdao, the presiding judge of the Third Criminal Division of the High Court, Zheng Chi, the presiding judge of the Second Criminal Division, and others of embezzlement and perversion of the law in handling the cases of Luo Buzhou (former compradore of the Nanjing Heji Foreign Firm), Wang Zuoliang, and Sun Yuan (chief of the San Francisco Consulate General in the Gao Ying Native Products Case). After the Ministry instructed President Lin of the High Court to secretly send Shen Yuan, the presiding judge of the Civil Division, and others to investigate, yesterday (the 16th), Lin submitted the results of the investigation to the Ministry of Justice for verification.</p>
<p>The Dispute Over the Xuanmiao Temple Wall Case Continues. The case of rebuilding shops on the old site of the Xuanmiao Temple Wall in Suzhou has been deadlocked for half a year between the preservationists and the business advocates. Although it has now been resolved, with the abbot of Yuandu raising funds to build houses for rent, there are still undercurrents within. Because the abbot of Huatai Xiyuan (also known as the Leizu Temple) claims that a portion of the old site of the wall belongs to Huatai Xiyuan, the right to rent it in the future should belong to Huatai Xiyuan, but the abbot has not agreed. Therefore, Huatai Xiyuan has hired lawyer Zhu Run and filed a lawsuit in the local court. The National Products Relief Association believes that the old site of the wall is public land, and in the future, the construction of houses for rent should be limited to national product shops. A report has been submitted to the Executive Yuan's Ministry of Interior for approval. However, a merchant from the area, Xu Xunru, submitted a report to the county government, claiming that the National Products Association's move was monopolizing business and requesting relief. Yesterday, the Iron and Silk Weaving Association also submitted a report to the county government and the Party headquarters, accusing Xu Xunru of destroying national products and requesting compliance with the Yuan's order to issue a notice prohibiting the opening of foreign goods stores. The outcome is unknown.</p>
<p>Jinshan County Magistrate Xu Gui's Unclear Handover. After Xu Gui, the former Jinshan County Magistrate and Director of the Finance Bureau, left office, the handover was not clear. After repeated urging by the succeeding County Magistrate Huang Zhewen and Finance Bureau Director Cheng Yin Gu, Xu ignored it. Huang then submitted a report to the province, which transferred it to the Wu County Government, ordering police to go to No. 64 Dataping Lane in Fengmen to strictly urge Xu Gui to go for clearing and handover.</p>

<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Various News from the Cold and Frozen Weather. The weather here is extremely cold, the rivers are frozen, and transportation is cut off. Although the temperature increased slightly on the 13th, the river ice is still difficult to melt, so the ships have not yet started. The Public Security Bureau, due to the long-term obstruction of transportation, ordered Inspector Cheng Chongli to go to the shipping companies to discuss ice-breaking measures. It was decided to recruit 30 temporary laborers, each receiving 1.2 yuan per day for labor and food, using wooden rafts to knock the ice. In the end, it was impossible to break the ice. Students studying abroad, seeing no hope of the ships starting and the school exams approaching, organized a walking group to Kunshan. The post office's letters were also carried by postmen on foot to Zhitang, then transferred to Kunshan for transportation by car, and then distributed to various places after arriving in Suzhou. Many schools have also suspended classes. Due to the cold and freezing weather, rickshaw pullers' business is slow, and their daily income is only a few hundred yuan, while the rent is 840 yuan per day. Therefore, they went on strike uniformly starting from the 13th. In the afternoon, hundreds of people gathered at the County Party Headquarters to request relief. The Public Security Bureau will search and arrest vagrants. The Jiangchang Labor Camp in this county has already been opened, but there are still many vagrants in society. At the Public Security Bureau's patrol officer meeting on the 13th, measures were decided to crack down on vagrants, and it was decided to arrest them and transfer them to the Vagrant Labor Camp for training.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>A Record of Exhumation and Verification of a Village Woman's Sudden Death. On February 18th of last year, Lu Wangshi, the wife of Lu Benda, a villager in Lu Xiang, Xi Xiang, Nanshuang Temple, Qingcheng City, suddenly died. Lu Wangshi's mother, Wang Jiangshi, based on rumors from outsiders that her daughter was strangled to death by Lu Benda, immediately submitted a report to the county government requesting an examination. The county government sent an official to examine the body and confirmed that she had died of illness. Wang Jiangshi expressed dissatisfaction and immediately reported the injustice. After reading the report, County Magistrate Pan submitted the case file to the High Court, requesting instructions for handling. The other day, the High Court appointed Lu Wenqin, a prosecutor from the Wu County Local Court, to come to Wuxi with a clerk to re-examine the body. Yesterday morning at about 11 a.m., Prosecutor Lu and others took a car to Luoshe and then transferred to Nanshuang Temple Lu Xiang to re-examine the body in accordance with the law. After arriving in the village, Prosecutor Lu questioned Wang Jiangshi, Lu Dabao (the deceased's father-in-law), Lu Benda, and the village head Zhang Keji. He then opened the coffin for examination. After examination, it was found that there were no strangulation marks on the deceased Lu Wangshi's neck. There were wooden object injuries on the back of her right hand and right arm. It was confirmed that she had died of suffocation due to illness. After the re-examination was completed, Prosecutor Lu ordered the deceased's husband, Lu Benda, to make a statement preparing a coffin for burial, and ordered the village head Zhang Keji to watch over Lu Benda and be available whenever summoned. After the instructions were completed, Prosecutor Lu and others returned to the city and reported back to Suzhou that night. However, according to Prosecutor Lu, this case will not be established as a murder case, as there are no real injury marks. Although there are two wooden object injuries on the hand, according to the law, it is only punishable as a case of one injury.</p>

<p>Bandits Extort Money. Qiang, a resident of Qiangjia Bridge, Taibo City, 12th District, used to be a village director and had a wealthy family. He had previously received a threatening letter from bandits, demanding 200,000 yuan. Qiang ignored the letter. The other afternoon, Qiang came to the city from the countryside to shake a club. Before leaving, he ordered a member of the security group to accompany him for protection. He took a car in Zhou Jing Lane. Unexpectedly, a bandit was secretly monitoring him. When the car arrived at the Wuxi Station, he ordered the accompanying group member to go back first. After Qiang got out of the car and walked to the vicinity of the station dormitory, he was stopped by a bandit who had been secretly monitoring him. At the same time, three bandits who had been ambushing there surrounded Qiang, threatened him with guns, and tied him to a certain inn on the road, booked a certain room, locked him in the room, and carried out negotiations. As a result, they extorted 15,000 yuan. At that time, they forced Qiang to write a certain Zhuang village ticket. A bandit took the ticket to a certain Zhuang to pay the money. When a certain Zhuang became suspicious, they immediately called Qiang to inquire. Qiang replied that the money should be paid as instructed. After the bandits got the money, they went far away. Qiang was finally able to regain his freedom and return home safely.</p>

<p>Extension of Time Limit and Free Registration of Salt Reclamation Land. The land registration agency for the salt reclamation companies in Huainan has been designated by the Ministry of Finance. Now, the companies report that it is difficult to collect deeds for the vast land area and the shareholders who have divided the land, and they request an extension of the time limit of half a year to the province. Also, the registration fee is one dime per mu. Most of the salt reclamation land has no income. The price of land is only a few jiao of silver, and some of the barren land is worthless. It is requested that the registration be free of charge to help the difficult situation of the barren land by the sea. It is unknown whether this will be approved.</p>

<h3>Pinghu</h3>
<p>Salt Police and Paramour Die Together at the Hands of Bandits. Near the Xiaojia Lane town of Peijia, at the intersection of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, there is a small team of salt police stationed at the Haiyue Nunnery.

Li was captured by the bandits and killed with several cuts. Zhang Erbao was also killed by the bandits.</p>
<p>Bandits in Dongxiang Rampant Beyond Belief. Bandits in Dongxiang, Pinghu, have been increasingly rampant recently. Recently, Liu Dexing, a notorious bandit, led small boss Cheng Laohu and dozens of gang members to the town on the 12th, broke into the Public Security Sub-bureau, intending to rob firearms. The bureau only had six rifles, all of which were dilapidated, so they did not rob them. On the 13th, Sub-bureau Chief Cheng Taichang sneaked into the city. The town was almost in bandit territory. On the 14th, the bandit leader sent a letter to seven families, including Lu Jingxin, Zhu Meisheng, Shen Qinqia, Gu Ba, etc., claiming that they would not use violence in view of Shen Qin's face, but that the military pay was lacking and that they needed to borrow 35,000 yuan. However, the town has always been poor, and this amount is not easy to raise, so it has not been resolved as of the 15th. It is said that Wu Sanlaoban is mediating and intends to offer several thousand yuan, but it has not been settled. The bandits have been staying for four days, all wearing wooden-cased guns, fur robes, and overcoats, and have sent out patrols. Hearing the news, various agencies in the city telegraphed the province on the 13th. On the afternoon of the 15th, they received a reply, saying that troops would be transferred immediately, and they could arrive no later than the 16th. Later, the bandits learned that six naval patrol teams of water police had arrived near the Huxiao Bridge. They fled east together.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>

He went to the district headquarters on the afternoon of the same day to take over the job, and Xu has transferred everything.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>Kidnapping and Extortion of 100,000 Yuan. Zhang Tianxiong, a wealthy man in Changxiang Village, Dongxiang, Xiaoshan, has now passed away. At the end of December of last year, more than 20 bandits broke down the door at night and kidnapped one of Zhang's concubines. A letter was recently received from a distance, demanding a ransom of 100,000 yuan. It is said that Zhang's two sons have both moved to Shaoxing, and it is unknown how to rescue her.</p>
<p>Reaction to the Order to Pay for Sand Fields. Since its flooding, the Shengwei Sand Field in Xiaoshan has been plagued by disputes. Now, the Sand Field Bureau has issued a notice stating that since the sand field has been flooded and collapsed, the qualifications of the original grain households have been eliminated. They should pay the price and not argue over completing grain payments at the bottom of the water. Now, it is estimated uniformly at the lowest price, and five jiao of silver should be paid per mu. Now, the various business owners hold official property office and former reclamation bureau issued ministry certificates and provincial certificates, decades of grain completion records, as well as new registration certificates and old red lists and other property certificates, according to the regulations, there is no need to pay again. They have stated the reasons and jointly requested the provincial bureau to quickly revoke the original case.</p>
<h3>Bengbu</h3>
<p>The Twists and Turns of the Anhui Province's Salt Tax Surcharge</p>
<p>The salt tax surcharge has become almost the sole source of income for military and administrative expenses in provinces such as Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hubei, totaling no less than 50 million yuan. However, Anhui Province's finances are more difficult than any other region. Considering just the defense forces, there is an annual shortfall of over 300,000 yuan. Exhausting all means, Chairman Chen submitted a proposal to the provincial government meeting to the effect that Anhui Province's salt tax surcharge should be limited to Jia'an and other counties. The areas where Zhejiang salt is sold in southern Anhui, and the areas along the Huai and Lu rivers in northern Anhui, have not been levied. The burden is uneven within the same Anhui region, so the proposal was to extend the levy to meet the military needs. When committee members arrived at the Bengbu Bureau to collect the tax, the local area began to vehemently oppose it, with letters and telegrams flying back and forth, all claiming that a surcharge of two yuan and forty cents per package was too heavy a burden, and that the people could not bear it. The standoff has lasted for weeks without resolution. It is rumored that the provincial government's fixed rate of two yuan and forty cents was calculated based on the sale of 1.4 million dan of salt in northern Anhui. Now, the Bengbu area alone can sell 2.4 million dan annually, so there is room for discussion about reducing the tax rate. As for the issue of centralizing salt administration, it will be difficult to implement until the finances of the various provinces are practically resolved. As for this urgent defense surcharge case, judging from the overall situation, it will take a sharp turn and seems unavoidable. Although the Bengbu Bureau has repeatedly received strict orders to start collecting, the responsible department is taking a peaceful approach, so no drastic measures have been taken yet. All parties should pay close attention to this important issue and resolve it quickly to avoid extremes.</p>

<p>(United Press, Tokyo, 16th) In view of the close relationship between China and Japan in the future, the Japanese Ministry of Education has decided to include Chinese language as an elective subject in secondary schools across Japan. Therefore, the current Enforcement Law of the Secondary School Ordinance, which states that "foreign languages are English, German, and French," must be amended to add "in addition to the three languages, Chinese language will also be included." It is planned to implement this from the new school term in April.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Explains the Relationship Between Education Associations and Party Headquarters</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education believes that education associations belong to cultural organizations and must be supervised and guided by party headquarters. It has specifically instructed the Zhejiang Education Department and the Qingdao Municipal Education Bureau to explain: (1) The Zhejiang Education Department reported that the Wu County Education Association submitted a request for instructions on whether the county education association should follow the procedures for reorganizing social organizations promulgated by the province. The Ministry of Education instructed: "Noted. According to the provisions of the revised organizational plan for people's organizations passed by the 101st Standing Committee of the Central Committee, people's organizations are divided into vocational organizations and social organizations. Social organizations include student organizations, etc. Furthermore, according to Article 2 of the organizational outline for cultural organizations passed by the 67th Standing Committee of the Central Committee, all organizations that promote academic, health, and educational qualities belong to cultural organizations. Since the education association aims to study educational matters and develop local education, it should belong to a cultural organization and must be supervised and guided by party headquarters. However, according to Item 8 of Section 3 of the revised organizational plan for people's organizations, '...people's organizations that already have an organization, but whose organizational content does not comply with this plan...should be ordered to reorganize.' Furthermore, after examining the contents of the regulations for education associations promulgated by the Ministry, they are not inconsistent with any of the clauses listed in Item 3 of Section 3 of the aforementioned plan. Therefore, if local education associations are organized and established in accordance with the regulations for education associations, they do not need to be reorganized. As for applying for permission from the party headquarters, this should be done in accordance with regulations. You are hereby informed and instructed to comply." (2) The Qingdao Municipal Education Bureau submitted a request from the Qingdao Municipal Education Association for an explanation of the relationship between the party headquarters and the association. The Ministry of Education instructed: "Noted. According to the revised organizational plan for people's organizations passed by the 101st Standing Committee of the Central Committee, people's organizations are divided into vocational organizations and social organizations. Social organizations include student organizations and cultural organizations. Furthermore, according to Article 2 of the organizational outline for cultural organizations passed by the 67th Standing Committee of the Central Committee, all organizations that promote academic and educational qualities belong to cultural organizations. Since the education association aims to study educational matters and develop local education, it should belong to a cultural organization. When corresponding with the party headquarters, it should comply with the regulations of the Central Committee regarding the official document format for interactions between people's organizations and party headquarters. You are hereby informed and instructed to comply."</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Refuses Stein's Entry into Xinjiang</h3>
<p>The Englishman Stein is traveling to Xinjiang this time with a large sum of money and many people. Considering Stein's past actions of smuggling Dunhuang stone treasure scriptures and murals, the Chinese people are extremely concerned. The Ministry of Education has repeatedly received requests from the Antiquities Preservation Committee and other parties to prevent him from entering Xinjiang and to revoke the originally issued passport. It has reported the situation to the Executive Yuan, which telegraphed the Xinjiang Provincial Government to act accordingly. According to a telegram from the Xinjiang Provincial Government to the Executive Yuan on the 15th, Stein is about to arrive in the province, and orders have been issued to the counties along the way to prevent him from proceeding and to order him to leave the country. Stein's archaeological work has not yet been implemented, and military personnel are accompanying him to monitor him, making it difficult for him to use his cunning. After receiving the telegram, the Executive Yuan yesterday (the 15th) instructed the Ministry of Education to telegraph the message to inform the Chinese people that the goal of protecting antiquities has been achieved.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Province Restricts the Admission of Transfer Students to Middle Schools</h3>
<p>The case of whether to separately stipulate restrictions on the acceptance of transfer students in middle schools in all grades was previously notified by the Ministry of Education to the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities to instruct the schools to investigate and act accordingly. However, the "Provisional Regulations for Transfer Students in County-Run Middle Schools in Jiangsu Province" restricts middle schools from accepting transfer students in the highest grade. This regulation clearly conflicts with the Ministry's order. The Jiangsu Provincial Education Department submitted a report to the Ministry of Education, outlining the difficulties of unrestricted transfer students in middle schools and requesting the Ministry to allow Jiangsu Province to follow the "Provisional Regulations for Transfer Students in Provincial and County-Run Middle Schools" separately stipulated by the province, given the special circumstances of middle schools in Jiangsu Province. After receiving the report, the Ministry of Education yesterday instructed the Jiangsu Education Department to temporarily allow the province to follow the "Provisional Regulations for Transfer Students" stipulated by the province.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Orders Provinces and Cities to Quickly Establish Mandarin Phonetic Symbols Committees</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education recently ordered the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities (excluding the eight provinces of Hubei, Hebei, Guangdong, Jiangxi, Guizhou, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Rehe, and the three cities of Nanjing, Hankou, and Shanghai) to report on the establishment of Mandarin Phonetic Symbols Promotion Committees in their provinces and cities and the cities and counties under their jurisdiction, in order to assess their performance. The order stated: "The regulations for the Mandarin Phonetic Symbols Promotion Committee of this Ministry have been formulated and promulgated, and on May of last year, Instruction No. 491 was issued to all to comply. Article 9 of the original regulations stipulates that each province and city, and the cities and counties under its jurisdiction, should comply with the regulations to establish Mandarin Phonetic Symbols Promotion Committees in their respective provinces, cities, and counties. A considerable amount of time has passed since then, and many have reported their establishment, but quite a few have not yet reported. We are now in the period of political tutelage. To enable the majority of illiterate people to increase their knowledge, we rely on the promotion of Mandarin Phonetic Symbols to help popularize education. The need for this committee in each province, city, and county is extremely urgent. Whether your province has complied with the establishment of the Mandarin Phonetic Symbols Promotion Committee has not yet been reported. Within one month of receiving this document, please compile and report the compliance situation in your province and the cities and counties under your jurisdiction, for assessment. This is of utmost importance." This order.</p>
<h3>Alumni Association of Jiangsu Medical University Submits a Request to Revise the Medical Education System (1)</h3>
<p>The Alumni Association of Jiangsu Medical University submitted a document to the Central Party Headquarters and the National Government requesting a revision of the medical education system, stating:</p>
<p>"Respectfully requesting the revision of the medical education system and permission to establish specialized medical schools, in order to cultivate practical medical talents extensively and promote health construction. Submitting our humble opinions, we earnestly hope that they will be considered. It is our belief that the rise and fall of national fortune, and the expansion and contraction of national power, are closely related to the health of the people. Our country has accumulated thousands of years of cultural weakness, and the average lifespan of the people is less than thirty years. The 'sick man of East Asia' is an undeniable truth. Our Party has inherited the teachings of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen and is implementing political tutelage. Health construction is included in the program, and excellent plans and ideas are welcomed throughout the country. However, at the beginning of construction, there is an urgent need for talent. Currently, the number of people in the country who have received scientific medical education is not large. Not only is it greatly insufficient to save the people from suffering in peacetime, but also, when it comes to recruiting talent to manage the national health administration, there may not be enough to meet the demand. In the future, the way to remedy this is to cultivate medical talent extensively, so that we can obtain practical talent in a short period of time to meet the needs of the country. However, at present, the number of medical education institutions is as scarce as morning stars. Since the closure of the specialized medical schools in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, the number of medical schools has become even smaller. The medical colleges of the highest institutions of learning are either newly established or awaiting preparation. Not only is there a temporary risk of interruption in the production of medical talent, but also the number of students studying at medical colleges is only a few dozen per year. Even if they achieve something in the future, it will be a drop in the bucket and may not be able to meet the urgent needs of the country and society. This is because the medical college program is too long, and at a time when social livelihoods are difficult, most students who are advancing their studies are reluctant to do so. There is no need for our association to elaborate on this, as your department must already regard it as a hidden concern. We have read in the newspapers of December 15th of last year that Dai Jitao, a member of your department, reported during the memorial week that he wanted to suggest to the Central Government that a specialized medical school should be established in each provincial capital and city with a population of over 300,000, and that each school should have a hospital with at least 200 beds, and that classes should begin in 1932. We see your clear insight and understanding of the crux of the problem. However, according to the current system of the Ministry of Education, specialized schools are required to be attached to medical colleges and are not allowed to be established independently. Therefore, the prerequisite for Mr. Dai's proposal must be that medical colleges are first established in various places, and then specialized departments can be attached. Considering the current financial strength of the provinces and cities, it is impossible to establish them in provincial capitals, let alone in every city with a population of over 300,000. Therefore, to increase medical education institutions, it seems that the education system must be revised so that specialized medical schools can be established independently."</p>

(2) According to a letter from the Songjiang County Education Bureau, the field rent for the Fuxue sweeping has been approved by the Provincial Education Department at 80% of the original plan, which is 800 yuan per year.

<h3>Dean Ling of Zhongguo University Resigns</h3>

<h3>X-ray Radium Expert Zhang Youmei Returns to China</h3>
<p>Zhang Youmei, a native of Pudong, Shanghai, graduated first in his class from the Department of Medicine at Aurora University in the summer of 1927 with a doctorate in medicine. That autumn, he went to France to enter the Department of Medicine at the University of Paris to pursue a doctorate in medicine, specializing in X-ray radium and electrical engineering. He achieved outstanding results, and Professor Sterluk highly valued him. He was invited to serve as an assistant instructor in the X-ray Department of the Charité Hospital of Paris and the Paris Radium Institute. In the autumn, he submitted his thesis, "The Advantages and Disadvantages of X-rays on Living Organisms," which was highly praised by the examiners and awarded the highest honor. He also received a doctorate in X-ray radium and electrical medicine from the University of Paris. The Charité Hospital of Paris intended to invite Zhang to be a physician at the hospital. However, Lu Bohong, the director of Sacred Heart Hospital in Yangshupu, Shanghai, urged him to return to China. Zhang arrived in Shanghai a few days ago to serve as the director of the X-ray and Electrical Therapy Department of Sacred Heart Hospital. The treatment of diseases with X-ray radium is a recent focus of the medical community in Europe and the United States. Although many in China's medical community study radium, Zhang Youmei is the first person to formally obtain a doctorate specializing in this field.</p>

<h3>Northeast University Basketball Team Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>A Group of Eleven Led by Song Junfu, Matches Begin on the 19th</p>
<p>The Northeast University basketball team, led by团长 Song Junfu, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. All eleven members of the team are staying at Jiaotong University. They will stay in Shanghai for twelve days, preparing to compete with the athletes of Shanghai six times. They are scheduled to leave Shanghai for Beijing on the evening of the 28th, where they will compete with Jinling and Central schools.</p>
<h3>A Shanghai Football Fan's Lucky Break</h3>
<p>At a time when basketball talent is emerging and the atmosphere is vigorous in Shanghai, a new force has suddenly arrived. There will be countless waves and many miracles to embellish it. Shanghai football fans are truly fortunate. Now that the army has arrived, the Association has officially announced the name of the opposing team. In the sound of silver whistles, we will see heroes from the North and South galloping on the field, each showing their skills. The meeting place has been set at the Chinese Basketball Hall on Laoxuefu Road. The competition schedule is as follows: (1) January 19th, Northeast University vs. Qingguang (2) January 21st, Northeast University vs. John (3) January 23rd, Northeast University vs. Labor University (4) January 25th, Northeast University vs. Zhonggong (5) January 27th, Northeast University vs. Huadong.

<h3>Northern Athletes are Versatile and Talented</h3>
<p>Readers will recall that at last year's National Games in Hangzhou, when athletes from all over the country competed for the basketball championship, the Liaoning team, which had previously been unknown, also made a great appearance and was in the limelight for a while. At that time, good players such as Ma Bingjun and Yuan Tingrui are still key members of the Northeast basketball team. In addition, with the addition of Zhao Lingzhi, Tian Xinguang, Pang Ying and other young talents, their fighting strength seems to be more impressive than that of the Liaoning team in the past. According to team leader Song Junfu, the team has excellent qualities. Their five-man defense work is well-organized and full of the spirit of teamwork. They tend to get better as they fight. Because of the lack of strong teams to compete with in the local area, they led the team south to seek improvement. However, they felt very tired from the long journey by car, and the diet and daily life were difficult. Fortunately, they were able to rest for a day or two, which did not affect their performance. The eleven members of the team are: team leader Song Junfu, captain and left guard Ma Bingjun, center Zhao Lingzhi, right forward Yuan Tingrui, left forward Tian Xinyuan, right guard Pang Ying, forwards Fu Bao, Zhu Furu, and Yang Zhongji, and inner guards Shi Wanxian and Jiang Zuo Zhou.</p>

<h3>The Strong and the Weak Draw</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the battle, Lu Zhonghui of Shanghai Zhongrong had the first free throw opportunity, but missed it in front of his face. Chen Zhaoqiu of Xiaguang scored a goal. After the record was opened, Feng Nianhua of Shanghai Zhongrong scored one point from a free throw, followed by Qian Jingyong, who scored a goal. Shanghai Zhong took the lead 3-2. Kang Yuefa of Xiaguang broke into the enemy's formation and made an aerial shot. Later, with the help of his teammates, Kang reaped the rewards. Xiaguang took the lead 6-3. Ren of Xiaguang committed a foul, and Feng Nianhua scored a free throw. Qian Jingyong also took the opportunity to hit someone. Ren Jiexing made up for his sins and made a long shot. Kang and Chen also each scored, and Xiaguang still led 11-6. Before long, there was a difference of 14-8 (Xiaguang took the lead). At that time, Shanghai Zhongrong's luck turned, and Wang, Lu, Feng Qian, etc., each made contributions, scoring eight points in total, and catching up to 16-14. Fortunately, Kang Yuefa raised his hands and made the score 16-16 at the half.</p>
<h3>Triumph After Hardship to Win the Championship</h3>
<p>After the lineup was reorganized, Ren Jiexing's two long shots bounced out. Xiaguang gained the upper hand, and the ball was mostly in their hands. However, Shanghai Zhongrong's defense was tight, and their ambitions could not be achieved. Suddenly, because of Wang's foul, Kang scored one point, and Cai Yan followed. Xiaguang took the lead 19-16. In the next three minutes, the battle was fierce. Shanghai Zhongrong triumphed after hardship, and Feng Nianhua single-handedly scored four points and exceeded by one point. Ren Jiexing made a long shot, and Xiaguang took the lead again. Dai Linzhen replaced Wang on the field, and the demeanor of a famous general was different after all. From then on, the whole team soared, and they were invincible. Before long, the inner guard Sun Zongqing was brave and injured his eyes, and blood flowed all over his face. Wang made a comeback, and he was still quite successful. As a result, Shanghai Zhong</p>

<h3>Yessheng Also Beats Chizhi (First Division)</h3>
<p>Chizhi Strikes First and Strong</p>
<p>Qian Dingshen made a successful shot and Yessheng sent out its troops. Chen Weide and Geng Bowei presented courage one after another and soon took the lead 6-4. Zeng Guangrong of Chizhi also contributed to the battlefield and tied the score. The momentum gradually shifted and Chizhi took the lead, making a difference of 15-6 in the blink of an eye. Yessheng rallied and the score gradually approached, but it was difficult to surpass them. At halftime, Chizhi led 21-15. The battle began again and Chen Weide of Yessheng made three consecutive shots, immediately tying the score 21-21. Xia Yushu committed four fouls, and Chizhi played with four players. However, they were still able to fight bravely and unyieldingly. Although Yessheng won, they only won by one point. The final score was 29-27, Yessheng won. Referee: Pei Lis</p>
<p>Haizei Defeats Zhenru (First Division)</p>
<p>Haizei made their debut, but their performance was not outstanding. Fortunately, they encountered Zhenru, whose talent was lacking, so they were still able to take the lead. Sullivan started it, and Zhenru countered, resulting in Zhang Jiyou tying the score. Zhenru's defense was quite strong, but their shooting was inaccurate. Otherwise, the score would have been impressive. Most of the three forwards in Haizei failed to score, so they changed to the inner guards to play in reverse, and they were very successful. At halftime, Haizei had 14 points and Zhenru had 4 points. At the beginning of the second half, Yin Guiren scored a free throw and Yu Wencai scored a goal, and the situation improved slightly. However, Haizei soon went straight in again and scored several goals. Haizei's momentum gradually flourished again. As a result, Haizei won 29-14.</p>

<h3>Record of the First General Meeting of the Two-Route Business Conference</h3>
<p>Six Motions Voted On, Remaining Submitted for Review</p>
<p>Second General Meeting Held This Morning</p>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Two-Route Business Conference held its first general meeting at 9:30 AM yesterday at the Jiande Savings Society on Bazilu Fusheng Road. A total of 114 people attended, including representatives from various regions, experts, and personnel from the railway bureau. The meeting lasted until 12:00 PM, with only six motions discussed and voted on. As it was not yet concluded, the meeting was extended twice. At 12:25 PM, it was decided to form a review committee to review the remaining motions and then submit them to the general meeting for discussion before adjourning. The second general meeting was held at the same location at 9:00 AM this morning. The details are recorded separately below.</p>
<h3>First General Meeting</h3>
<p>Chairman's Address The meeting was called to order at 9:30 AM yesterday morning with the ringing of a bell. The representatives took their seats according to their assigned numbers and performed the rituals. First, Chairman Liu Weizhi gave an address, reporting on the status of the proposals, stating that the railway bureau had reviewed and classified them according to their nature. He asked the representatives to express their opinions as much as possible, and the railway bureau would adopt them as much as possible within its capacity. Minister Sun of the Ministry of Railways would also be happy to accept them. Regarding freight cars, in addition to purchasing 100 forty-ton cars, the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway would also lease 200 twenty-ton cars from merchants for use on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. He said that freight cars should be sufficient from now on, but there was still a shortage of locomotives. It is planned to purchase another 20 locomotives this year, and a decision will be made within February, which is of great importance to the future of commercial transportation.</p>
<p>Discussion After the chairman's address, he temporarily excused himself due to important railway bureau matters, and Vice Chairman Liu Chengzhang announced that the meeting would follow the agenda and discuss the various motions. At that time, Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce representatives Wang Xiaopu, Ye Huijun, and Yan Esheng suggested that as there were more than 180 motions for the general meeting, the discussion would take a long time. They proposed forming a review committee to review the motions in groups on the 17th and 18th, and then submit them to the general meeting for discussion on the 19th and 20th. They also proposed forming a two-route business promotion association as a permanent body. After a long discussion, the majority still decided to follow the agenda and begin discussing station services, starting with motions 126. Chairman Liu Weizhi attended again to report that the construction of a branch line to Ganlu Port in Zhenjiang was estimated to cost 600,000 yuan. Now, due to the high price of gold pounds, it would cost 1 million yuan, but the estimated annual income was only 400,000 yuan. Therefore, the railway bureau planned to first build the Zhenjiang Customs branch line, which would only cost 120,000 yuan, and would generate more profit in the future. Once business developed, the construction of the Ganlu Port branch line would continue. There were no objections. Then, motions 127 to 130 were discussed, and resolutions were made based on the railway bureau's responses. Subsequently, motion 131, regarding the construction of a wharf and warehouse in Wusong to facilitate transportation, was discussed. Railway Bureau representative Kuang Kaihua reported that the railway bureau was currently planning to proceed with the proposal and invited representatives from the Wusong and Shanghai chambers of commerce, as well as the Jianghai Customs, the Whangpoo Conservancy Board, and the municipal government, to jointly carry out the discussion. By then, it was nearly noon, and the majority argued that this motion was important and should be submitted for review. Representative Zheng Baoran proposed in support, and Wang Xiaolai and others temporarily proposed forming three review committees for station services, transportation, and freight to submit the motions that the general meeting had been unable to discuss for review, to be discussed at tomorrow's (i.e., today's) general meeting. After extending the meeting twice for a total of 25 minutes, it was discussed and resolved to form three review committees to submit motions 131 to 184, 1 to 48, and 49 to 68 for review. As the representatives were unfamiliar with each other and their occupations were unknown, it was decided that the chairman would appoint the members of each review committee before adjourning the meeting.</p>
<p>Motions Resolved (1) Motion 126: Expedite the construction of the Zhenjiang Ganlu Port branch line to facilitate transportation and protect commerce. Resolved: The railway bureau is currently undertaking the survey and construction of the Zhenjiang Customs branch line. After the completion of the branch line, it will plan and proceed. (2) Motion 127: Extend the nine tracks at the Beijing Station and add another track to facilitate intermodal transport (i.e., intermodal transport with Beijing municipal trains). Resolved: The railway bureau will adopt and implement it. Motion 128: Add freight car tracks at Jiaxing Station. Resolved: As freight transport in Jiaxing is not developed, it will be postponed. Motion 129: Extend the freight car siding and warehouse river channel at Qiyan Shu Station to accommodate more vehicles. Resolved: The railway bureau's engineering department will survey and handle it. Motion 130: Add freight branch lines at Ningbo Gaozhu Station to prevent boat transport and benefit train transport. Resolved: The railway bureau will handle it at its discretion.</p>

<h3>Visiting the Wusong Machine Factory</h3>

At 2:00 PM yesterday, they were invited by the railway bureau to take a special train to Wusong to visit the machine factory.

They also saw four new Pacific-type locomotives still being assembled, and new cars were being set up with body freight car bottoms and steel frames. The Shanghai-Ningbo armored car body was nearing completion. The representatives were satisfied and also visited the Wusong wharf for a week's tour.</p>

<h3>Public Servants Must Purchase Tickets for Ferry Rides</h3>

<p>The Songhu Garrison Command issued a notice yesterday, stating: "Regarding the matter of issuing a notice, according to the Shanghai Shipping Association's report that government personnel and retired soldiers, as well as those wearing miscellaneous uniforms, traveling on the Shanghai-Yangtze River routes, generally do not comply with regulations and purchase tickets, the matter is forwarded for verification and an order for prohibition to alleviate the difficulties of merchants and maintain the shipping industry. According to the letters from the association's members, Dada Steamship Company and Datong Renji Shipping Company, each of our companies' ships, sailing to various ports on the Shanghai-Yangtze River, encounter public institutions personnel and retired soldiers, as well as those wearing miscellaneous uniforms, traveling back and forth on the ships, generally not buying tickets. Despite repeated and sincere persuasion from the ticket office, they ultimately ignore it or even cause disputes. Recently, the business situation has been bleak, and it is difficult to make a profit in the industry. In addition, the lack of ticket purchases has caused even greater losses. Our companies have endured this for a long time, and the losses have been significant. Therefore, we have clearly stated the facts in a letter to your association, requesting that you forward it to the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force and the Shanghai Garrison Command to be mindful of the difficulties of merchants and issue an order for prohibition. From now on, no institutions or military personnel shall use the excuse of public service to seek free tickets. All those who have reserved berths must purchase tickets according to their class and pay the full price, so that the future of the shipping industry can have sufficient income and be able to make up for the losses. This is truly a public good. The association has investigated that the transportation of active military personnel by ship has long been subject to regulations formulated by the Transportation Department of the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and the implementation has been ordered. All military personnel should strictly comply with these regulations. If they are not military personnel, they should be even more strictly controlled. It is reasonable to forward the matter for verification and an order for prohibition to alleviate the difficulties of merchants and maintain the shipping industry, which is a public convenience. Based on this, it is hereby announced that all persons of various types must comply with it. It is imperative. This notice."</p>

<h3>Anhui Residents Telegraph to Request the Cancellation of the Anhui Salt Tax Increase</h3>
<p>In order to fund provincial defense expenses, the Anhui Provincial Government has established a bureau to collect a salt tax surcharge of 2.4 yuan per stone on both Anhui South Zhejiang Permits and Anhui North Huai Permits. Anhui residents in Shanghai were greatly alarmed upon hearing this news. Organizations such as the All-Anhui Public Association, the Huining Shanghai Fellow-Villagers Association, and the She County Shanghai Fellow-Villagers Association have all telegraphed Chairman Chiang and Finance Minister Song, urging them to swiftly order the province to cancel the tax.</p>
<h3>Land Bureau Extends Deadline for Handling Ministry Certificates for Grain Assessment</h3>
<p>Extended to March 8th</p>
<p>Land Will Be Confiscated If Overdue</p>
<p>Previously, in order to reorganize land, the Land Bureau issued a notice on May 9th of the 19th year, regarding the business owners holding Ministry Certificates for Sha Tian official property of the Ministry of Finance, that those who had not yet registered for grain assessment should apply for it, be ordered to pay the assessment fee, and exchange for land business licenses to manage the property. The notice set a deadline for all business owners to comply within six months. By the deadline of November 8th, many had complied, but some were delayed due to owners being away or the property being mortgaged. To accommodate business owners, the Land Bureau submitted a request to the Municipal Government to extend the deadline by four months to March 8th. Those who still apply late or conceal their property in the hope of evading taxes will have the land confiscated by the city after the city reimburses the business owner with the original land price paid to the Sha Tian official property bureau plus 6% annual interest, deducting unpaid taxes over the years. It is reported that a renewed notice will be issued to all business owners to comply.</p>
<h3>Reply to Inquiry Regarding the Collection of Acreage Surtax</h3>
<p>County Government Replies to the Social Bureau</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau sent a letter to the County Government regarding the collection of acreage surtax to allocate it to the Agricultural Bank Fund. The Social Bureau requested the County Government to provide a comprehensive reply regarding the numbers of collection and accumulation. After receiving the letter, County Magistrate Yan immediately instructed the Finance Bureau to investigate and reply. Director Wang clarified that this acreage surtax was a 2-cent surtax per mu levied under the order of Sun Chuanfang, the Commander-in-Chief of the Five Provinces Allied Army, before the arrival of the National Revolutionary Army. It was levied under the winter tribute of the 15th year and the busy silver of the 16th year. At that time, the area had not yet been divided, so the busy tribute of the 16th year was still collected by the Finance Bureau. Therefore, the County Government has already sent a letter to the Social Bureau to inform them of the situation.</p>
<h3>Statutory Organizations Eligible for Reduced House Tax</h3>
<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Notifies Various Trade Associations</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to various trade associations yesterday, stating: "In accordance with Article 5 of the Shanghai Municipal House Tax Collection Rules, which were amended and promulgated for the third time on September 27th of the 19th year of the Republic, charitable organizations and other statutory organizations that have not yet reported to the central ministry or the competent bureau of this city for registration shall pay the full tax, but shall be allowed to apply for reduction or exemption after registration." The letter further stated: "All trade associations that have completed the reorganization procedures and have applied to the Social Bureau for registration and have been granted licenses should list the date of approval of registration, the license number, the detailed address of the association, and the current monthly house tax amount, so that they can be compiled and submitted to the Municipal Government for consideration of tax reduction. This is of utmost importance."</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Construction Department Committee Takes Over the Inland River Merchants Steamship Bureau</h3>
<p>Director Chen Shuntong's Resignation Approved</p>
<p>Shi Ying Sends Shi Zhaoji to Replace Him</p>
<p>Since the Zhejiang Provincial Government leased the Inland River Merchants Steamship Bureau last year, Director Chen Shuntong, Shanghai Bureau Manager Zhang Shusheng, and Operations Director Qin Jun have all exerted their best efforts to expand the business. In seven months, all 28 routes were opened, and two new routes were added last month in Zhenze and Huzhou. The business was just getting on track when Director Chen suddenly resigned. Shi Ying, the newly appointed Director of the Zhejiang Construction Department, has already sent a committee to Shanghai to take over. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Director Chen's Resignation: Director Chen Shuntong is an expert in Shanghai shipping and is very familiar with various passenger groups. Previously, after Zhejiang Governor Zhang Jingjiang leased the Inland River Merchants Steamship, he hired Chen to serve as the director of the management office, originally planning to revitalize the dilapidated inland river shipping industry. He planned to generate 400,000 in business within a year. Therefore, after taking over, he invited Zhang Shusheng, a leader in the Shanghai customs brokerage industry, to serve as the Shanghai Bureau Manager. In the seven months of operation, there was a surplus every month. The difficulty was that the accounting offices of the Shanghai and Hangzhou bureaus had too many officials appointed by the government, requiring more than 10,000 yuan in monthly salaries, which was a huge expense. After Governor Zhang resigned this time, Director Chen went to Hangzhou to strongly request his resignation to Construction Director Shi Ying, in order to show his solidarity with the Governor. His resignation has been approved, and he is preparing to hand over the work immediately.</p>
<p>New Director to Arrive in Shanghai: The new director, Shi Zhaoji, has been appointed by the Construction Department and will come to Shanghai to take over. Shi is a relative of Construction Director Shi Ying and has previously worked in the Yidu Shipping Bureau in Hankou. He has considerable experience in shipping matters. The appointment telegram has arrived in Shanghai yesterday, ordering him to temporarily act as director. Before being officially appointed, Shi has already sent someone to Shanghai to investigate everything, because the routes in the Suzhou-Hangzhou inland rivers are complex and the bureau currently has more than 20 routes. Therefore, it is necessary to inquire beforehand. He is expected to arrive in Shanghai within the next few days to take office.</p>
<p>Changes in the System: When Zhang Jingjiang leased the bureau, he ordered it to be managed by the Shipping Administration Bureau and supervised by the Construction Department. Now that Shi Ying has taken over, the system has been changed, and the Merchants Inland River Shipping Bureau is directly under the Construction Department and no longer managed by the Shipping Administration Bureau. As a result, Sun Yunxiao, the Director of the Shipping Administration Bureau, also submitted his resignation, which was reportedly approved by Shi Ying. Furthermore, the bureau will be reduced in size. It is said that 15 old personnel in the Construction Department have been dismissed by Shi, while 40 new officials have been appointed.</p>
<p>Suspension of New Routes: After Chen Shuntong and Zhang Shusheng added two new routes in Hangzhou, Huzhou, Zhenze, and Si'an in December of last year, they planned to add another new route in Shaoxing and Yuhang this month, specializing in the transportation of goods. They had already discussed the plan with Xie Nian, the resident assistant in Hangzhou, and were proceeding with adding ships. At the same time, they also agreed to build two fast purple oil boats to compete with the Sixth Company on the Shanghai-Lake route. All the new plans were just getting underway when Chen resigned, causing them to be suspended indefinitely, which is a great pity. Passenger Groups Discuss Retention: In order to fundamentally develop the business, Chen, Zhang, and others actively negotiated with the customs and tax offices regarding the transportation of goods by various passenger groups, requesting a reduction in the tax rate for incoming and outgoing goods. After three months of efforts, they finally succeeded. The cargo owners and passenger groups in the Ting, Zhejiang, and inland areas all praised them. The convenience in taxation was significant, so the bureau's business was better than other bureaus. Now that Chen has resigned, the various passenger groups in Suzhou, Shanghai, Lake, and Wuxi and other ports have learned of it and are proposing to request his retention. However, Chen's determination to resign is firm, and he has ordered the various departments to handle the handover procedures.</p>
<h3>Jiang-Zhejiang Fisheries Bureau Notifies Fish Markets to Investigate Japanese Fishing Boats</h3>
<p>In order to Submit a Serious Protest to the Authorities</p>
<p>The Jiang-Zhejiang Fisheries Affairs Bureau in Shanghai believes that the large-scale fishing by Japanese fishing boats in the coastal waters of Jiang-Zhejiang is an infringement on China's rights. Recently, it specifically notified various fish markets and fishing industry merchant groups to investigate Japanese fishing boats at any time and report them, so that it can submit a serious protest to the competent authorities and request them to inform the diplomatic authorities. The original letter is as follows: "It is known that the sea areas of Jiang-Zhejiang have vast fishing grounds and abundant fish resources. There are countless fishing villages, numbering in the millions. The relationship to the national economy and the people's livelihood is both deep and great. However, in recent years, the area has been plagued by local troubles and rampant pirates, causing harm to merchants and civilians. The fishing industry is declining, and many still use old methods of fishing, failing to make improvements. The supply is insufficient to meet demand, and the profits are difficult to compensate for the original capital. The fishing industry is declining rapidly. Moreover, some unscrupulous people are acting as agents, disregarding the national interest and seeking their own selfish gains. Is it only affecting tax revenue and suppressing the fishermen's last hope for survival? Speaking of this makes us feel disheartened. This bureau is the organ for collecting marine fish tax and is tasked with prohibiting foreigners from encroaching on territorial waters. In view of the decline of the fishing industry, we must earnestly promote and guide it. We must also earnestly protect China's territorial fishing rights and conduct strict investigation. We have consulted with the Jiang-Zhejiang Provincial Fisheries Center to jointly handle it from time to time, advocating and guiding fishermen in various places to improve fishing, hoping to develop it. We have also supervised the captains of the relevant warships to earnestly patrol the sea and strictly investigate. If any foreign ships are found to have encroached on territorial waters to catch fish, they should first be stopped by peaceful means at any time, and the location, date, ship type, flag, ship size, and number of fishermen should be recorded in detail and reported to the bureau, which will submit it to the competent authorities for serious protest and handling by the diplomatic authorities. It is assumed that your public office is a fishing industry merchant group and has more knowledge and closer access. If there is any of the above, you should report it at any time to protect fishing rights. Secondly, you should persuade all fish businesses to take patriotism and love of the community as the premise, maintain each other and jointly develop the domestic fishing industry to benefit the people's livelihood. At this time, when advocating national goods and saving the country, people all over the country are working together, and our fishing industry should rise up. Those who do not know how to cherish themselves will be spurned by the people. Colleagues should supervise each other and take care of the overall public reputation to avoid damaging the fishing industry. Please earnestly persuade them and report the situation. Special attention is requested. With utmost anticipation, the Finance Department of the Jiang-Zhejiang Fisheries Affairs Bureau."</p>
<h3>Part of Goods Shipped to the United States Exempted from Filling Out Consular Price List</h3>
<p>The Continental News reports that, traditionally, goods shipped to the United States with a value of more than 100 British gold pounds require a consular price list to be filled out and submitted with the export documents. Recently, the American Consulate General announced that the U.S. Treasury Department has decided that, henceforth, all goods exempt from duty and ad valorem tax by the U.S. Customs will no longer be required to fill out a consular price list. However, the tax classification of these goods must be easily identifiable, and the attached commercial invoice must also be sworn to be free of concealment or false reporting. If, in the future, customs officials have any doubts about the category of the goods upon entry, they will still need to provide a consular price list to be able to import. Currently, the main exports from this port to the United States that can be exempted from filling out a consular price list are tea, tung oil, sesame oil, raw oil, eggs, powder, frozen eggs, raw silk, bristles, and furs.</p>
<h3>Resolutions of the Chinese Cigarette Industry</h3>
<p>The Executive Committee of the Chinese Cigarette Industry Association adopted a resolution on the mutual assistance between officials and merchants and the elimination of abuses and promotion of benefits for the tax authority, stating: "Our Chinese cigarette industry has been in a very difficult situation since the increase in tax rates and the rise in costs. Fortunately, Director Xie has returned to his old post and is open about everything, treating merchants and civilians with sincerity. He readily accommodates anything that is convenient for merchants and civilians, benefiting the country and caring for merchants, taking both sides into consideration. This time, he has revised the new tax system to be fair and equitable, which is very fortunate for Chinese merchants. In the future, Chinese merchants will also assist the tax authority with any cigarette factories that have not yet complied or have concealed tax revenue, so as to fulfill the obligation of cooperation." The Chinese Cigarette Industry Association has listed this as a proposal for discussion and it has been unanimously approved.</p>

<h3>Red Cross Receives Disaster Report from Siyang and Suqian</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Red Cross Society received an official letter from Zhang Pengzhu, the magistrate of Siyang County, stating that according to a report from Zhu Qingzhao and other standing committee members of the county's fundraising disaster relief committee, Siyang is located in a remote area north of the Yangtze River, with barren land and impoverished people. Last year, it was affected by the war, and bandits took the opportunity to rise up in groups, ranging from thousands to hundreds. They were well-equipped with sophisticated weapons, and their ferocity was overwhelming. They killed people throughout the fields when attacking villages and left nothing behind when looting towns. Cases of murder, arson, and extortion were almost daily occurrences. From spring to autumn, the banditry showed no signs of abating. Women and children forgot their sleep, and able-bodied men abandoned their farming. The area affected by the bandits covered approximately two thousand square miles in all directions, with tens of thousands of households suffering losses of property close to a million, and the deaths of thousands of men and women. This is the situation regarding the bandit disaster. The main source of income for the people of Siyang is from the South Lake and North Polder areas. Last year, during the spring and summer, the Huai River flooded, and Honghu Lake overflowed, turning the lakeside area into a swamp. The water did not recede for eight days. Last year's wheat harvest was lost, and this year's wheat could not be planted. In addition, excessive rainfall caused flooding. The fertile fields in the interior suffered a poor harvest, and the polder land in the north and the lake land in the south were equally affected. The people's livelihood was cut off. This is the situation regarding the flood disaster. Qingzhao and others witnessed the suffering and knew that seeking disaster relief was necessary to save the remaining people affected by the bandits and floods. Therefore, they convened an emergency meeting and publicly appointed Yi Fengwu and Li Angxuan as committee members to travel and appeal for help, hoping to obtain generous donations from various charitable organizations to provide disaster relief. They have presented the situation in detail and requested that it be forwarded to the Shanghai Red Cross Society, etc. Based on this, it is clear that Siyang has suffered from both bandits and floods since February of last year. Criminals and bandits are everywhere, and corpses fill the fields. Villages and hamlets have become ruins, and the old and young are wandering in ditches. Those who have fallen into bandit captivity must pay thousands of silver dollars for ransom. Where can they find the copper mountains and gold mines? Those who live near the water's edge struggle to find a single meal a day. Everywhere they look, they see cold stoves and barren smoke. The dead cannot be comforted, and the living are in urgent need of rescue. The information presented by the committee members is all accurate. Therefore, we are submitting this official letter and earnestly request that your esteemed society show great compassion and provide assistance to relieve the distress of the people and save them from their plight. We are extremely hopeful.</p>
<p>The society also received an official letter from the Suqian County Temporary Disaster Relief Committee, requesting assistance, with the situation being particularly pitiful. The letter stated, "Our county has suffered from both flood and bandit disasters, and the situation is extremely dire and in urgent need of relief. We have previously reported the situation and publicly appointed Committee Member Liu Ruzhen as a representative to seek your generous assistance. We hope that you will show compassion to the survivors of this great calamity and provide assistance. We have now received a letter from the Tenth District Office stating that the towns and villages in our district, including Xishan Township and Nanshan Township, were previously occupied by a large group of bandits, who brutally killed more than twenty people and burned more than ten villages. According to statistics, more than five hundred households were affected, and all their houses, utensils, and coarse grass items were reduced to ashes. About one thousand five hundred men, women, old, and young fled their homes, with no homes, no clothes, and no food. The north wind is piercingly cold, and they have nowhere to turn, wandering and crying out in despair. It is heartbreaking to witness. Moreover, the autumn harvest is coming to an end, and the east wind is still far away. The future is uncertain, and when will the wheat harvest arrive? We desperately hope that you will come to our rescue. Although the dead have already died unjustly underground, if the living do not receive your grace, they will inevitably fill the ditches. Thinking of this, we are filled with pity. However, we, who serve the local area, failed to prevent this from happening, causing the bandits to run rampant and affecting thousands of people. We are lost and feel deeply guilty. However, our strength is weak, and our abilities are limited, and we cannot save them. In addition to reporting to the county and province and requesting compassionate assistance, we believe that your esteemed society is charitable and will be able to provide assistance. Therefore, we are writing this letter to earnestly request that you take swift action to provide relief, so that the thousands of disaster victims can be saved. We will be eternally grateful. We hope that you will understand our situation." Upon receiving this letter, the society immediately sent personnel to investigate and confirmed that the situation was indeed dire and unbearable to witness. Therefore, we are again presenting the disaster situation and respectfully requesting that your esteemed society, in consideration of the disaster victims' displacement, lack of clothing, and lack of food, provide swift assistance to save the remaining lives. We are awaiting your instructions with utmost urgency.</p>
<h3>Two Groups Send Personnel to Jiangxi to Handle Disaster Relief</h3>

<h3>Head of Xinchang Security Corps Shot and Killed by Robbers in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Encountered robbers on the way home from watching a play late at night</p>
<p>Killed for showing slight resistance</p>
<p>Ni Jian, a native of Wenzhou, the current head of the Xinchang Security Corps in Pudong, was 43 years old. His younger brother, Wenhao, is currently a soldier serving in the residence of Jiang Tongzhang, the section chief of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, at No. 9 Yong'an Lane, Baire Road, Taiping Bridge, in the French Concession. Ni Jian came to Shanghai the day before because the younger brother of a colleague from the corps was getting married in western Shanghai. He personally went to congratulate him and stayed at the colleague's house that night. The next day (the 15th), he went to his brother Wenhao's place and prepared to spend the night, planning to return to the Xinchang Corps headquarters yesterday morning. Because Ni Jian was working in Pudong, he rarely had the opportunity to visit Shanghai for leisure during this busy winter defense period. So, that night (the 15th), he and his brother Wenhao, along with a 14-year-old child, went to the Qitian Stage next to the Great World on Avenue Edward VII to watch the newly staged Journey to the West. After the show ended at 12:30 a.m. yesterday morning, they went to a nearby restaurant for a snack. It was already 1:30 a.m. and they planned to return to Section Chief Jiang's residence. The three of them walked shoulder to shoulder, turning from Avenue de Messimy into Route Groke. When they reached the front of No. 34 on that road, two robbers dressed in black suddenly rushed out from beside a telephone pole, each holding a pistol, and proceeded to rob them. Ni Jian was wearing a silk robe. The two robbers threatened him with guns, forcing him to take off his clothes. Ni Jian was unwilling to submit and reached out to grab one of the robbers. Just as he was about to take the gun, he was shot in the left abdomen by the other robber. He immediately fell to the ground with the injury. The two robbers took the opportunity to escape. Because the injury was to a vital area, he immediately died. His brother Wenhao, seeing that both robbers had pistols, did not dare to resist. He rushed to the Songshan Road police station to report. The head of the police immediately sent detectives to investigate. They first carried the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall to examine the body. The criminal section of the French police station reported to the French Court. Judge Zhu arrived at the scene at 2:30 p.m. to examine the body. He sat in the official seat. The investigator reported the previous situation. Ni Wenhao, the younger brother of the deceased, also described the situation at the time. Judge Zhu ruled that the deceased Ni Jian had been shot and killed by robbers. The body was photographed and allowed to be collected by the family members. The police station was ordered to strictly apprehend the robbers and bring them to justice.</p>
<h3>Town-Wide Strike in Xinzhuang</h3>
<p>Caused by Forced Tea Shop Donations</p>
<p>Xinzhuang Town in western Shanghai is located at the junction of Songjiang and Shanghai. The market is considered quite good. It originally belonged to Songjiang County but has now been划入(designated) into the urban area, but it has not yet been taken over. Yesterday morning, the police from the Fifth Branch of the Public Security Bureau collected tea donations from various tea shops without success and detained the owners of the tea shops, demanding payment, which aroused public outrage from all the shops in the town. At about 3:00 p.m., they closed their doors and went on strike. The details of this case are as follows:</p>
<p>Forced Tea Donations and Detained Shop Owners</p>
<p>The market in Xinzhuang Town is usually better than other towns in western Shanghai. There are more than a dozen tea shops of various sizes in the town. The Public Security Bureau branch there relies heavily on tea donations for income because the police salary is insufficient. Recently, the weather has been cold, and the market has been sluggish, resulting in a large backlog of tea donations, even owing tens of thousands. Zhou Dacheng, the patrol officer of the branch, discussed solutions with the district office. The district office replied to the branch, ordering them to strictly collect all the donations. After receiving the order, Patrol Officer Zhou sent police to the tea shops, ordering them to pay the donations within a limited time, or they would be arrested and detained and forced to pay. Six people, including the owner of the Tongchun Tea Garden, were arrested.</p>
<p>Public Outrage and Town-Wide Strike</p>
<p>After the arrest and detention of the six tea shop owners, the tea shops were greatly alarmed and gathered to discuss solutions. They believed that the police station's behavior made it impossible to operate their businesses. At about 11:00 a.m., they unanimously closed their doors and went on strike first. On the one hand, they sent representatives to request assistance from the Chamber of Commerce, which asked the police bureau to release the six arrested people. At that time, all the merchants and residents of the town were outraged after learning about the above situation and discussed it heatedly. At about 3:00 p.m., the two major foreign goods and silk shops, Feng Tai Xing and Hongda, and the Tongkang pawnshop, and dozens of other larger shops, first went on strike. By about 4:00 p.m., the entire town went on strike to support the tea shops.</p>
<p>The Town Chamber of Commerce Held an Emergency Meeting</p>
<p>After the town-wide strike, Wang Xingsheng, chairman of the town's Chamber of Commerce, and committee members Qian Jianzhang, Jin Zechun, Pan Mengsheng, etc., immediately convened a temporary emergency meeting of representatives from more than thirty major stores to discuss solutions. Patrol Officer Zhou Dacheng was invited to attend and questioned the reasons. He attributed it to the orders of the district office, but after investigating the district office, they said it was the instructions of the county government.</p>
<h3>Xiao's Mother Telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Yesterday</h3>
<p>Requesting Serious Negotiations on the Xiao Xin'an Insult Case</p>
<p>Xiao Huangling, the mother of Xiao Xin'an, telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday, saying, "To Your Excellency Wang, Minister of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing. My daughter, Xiao Xin'an, was hired by the Bede School in Makassar, Nanyang, and Buru Island, and was appointed by the Nanjing Municipal Education Bureau. She went abroad in September of last year. Unexpectedly, she was insulted by the first and second mates of the Zhava Ship in the middle of the journey. This matter has been rescued by compatriots at home and abroad, and your ministry has requested the Dutch consul to severely punish the first and second mates. My daughter Xin'an serves the capital and has always valued her reputation. Although she is almost thirty years old, she has no misconduct. Her fellow villagers and classmates all praise her. This unprovoked insult is extremely important to her lifelong reputation and should be regarded as a great shame and humiliation to our country's diplomacy. If it is not thoroughly investigated, what consequences can be imagined? I implore your ministry to conduct serious negotiations and severely punish the first and second mates who committed the crime, as well as the Zhava Ship Bureau that protected the criminals, in accordance with the law, in order to uphold justice and fairness. Not only will I be grateful and never forget your kindness, but all compatriots across the country will also praise you endlessly. Xiao Huangling of Yixing bows her head."</p>
<h3>How Heartless, a Woman</h3>
<p>Husband Paralyzed...Requests Divorce</p>
<p>Son Cries Loudly...Turns Her Head and Ignores</p>
<p>Wang Zhaolin, a native of this county, lives in Yangjiazhai, Pudong. He used to be a cold-work craftsman in the Jiangnan Shipyard. He recently suffered from rheumatic fever in his legs, making it difficult to walk, so he stopped working and stayed at home for medical treatment. Three years ago, he married Jia through a matchmaker and had two sons, one three years old and the other only three months old. In October of this year's lunar calendar, Wang Jia left her paralyzed husband and two infants on the pretext of going out to work, never to return. Now, Wang Jia has suddenly filed a lawsuit with the local court, requesting a divorce. The reason she stated was that she had been abused and beaten by her husband and had no food or clothing, so she went out to work and earn a living as a servant, requesting permission to divorce. Yesterday morning, Judge Tong Shenglie opened the court to hear the case. Because Wang Zhaolin was paralyzed in both legs, he hired someone to carry him to the court in a rattan chair, holding his three-year-old son in his arms. After the judge took his seat, Jia Wang was first questioned. She stated that she was 23 years old, from Jiajiajiao, Pudong. She got married at the age of 20 and is now working as a servant in the Feng family in Derenfang, Ai'erjin Road. Because he (referring to the defendant) doesn't earn money, she has to divorce him. (Question) When was the engagement? (Answer) I was only ten years old when we got engaged. (Question) Did you know that he had this rheumatic fever when you got married? (Answer) I knew, but he could still walk at that time. (Question) You said he beat you, but you have no scars to show. Husband and wife should support each other. Now that the defendant is paralyzed and cannot work, you want to divorce him. Where is your conscience? Even if we take a step back, the two infants are your own children. For the sake of the children, you should reconcile. It's better not to divorce. However, she insisted on the divorce. Next, the defendant Wang Zhaolin was questioned. He stated that he was 26 years old and currently suffers from rheumatic fever. Not only can he not walk, but he cannot even raise his hands. Since the summer of this year, he has been bedridden. (Question) If you can't work, how do you live? (Answer) I have elder brothers and sisters who help me, so I won't starve. (Question) Where are you receiving medical treatment? (Answer) I'm receiving medical treatment at Lanni Ferry. (Question) Did you beat the plaintiff? (Answer) No such thing. She wants a divorce, and I don't want it. The judge then invited Prosecutor Yang Qi to the court to express his opinion. He briefly stated that the plaintiff's request for divorce was groundless and should be rejected. The judge then announced the end of the debate and scheduled the judgment for the 19th of this month. When the court adjourned, the child caught sight of his mother, burst into tears, stretched out his little hands, wanting his mother to hold him. However, she turned a blind eye, turned her head and ignored him, and left the court in a hurry with another woman, heading north. For a moment, all the bystanders could not bear it, and even three or four women waiting for trial shed tears for him, scolding her for being heartless.</p>
<h3>Arrest of Reactionaries</h3>
<p>Many Printed Materials Confiscated</p>
<p>Among the workers of the Shengdan Silk Factory at No. 143 Huade Road, there are quite a few who have been induced by bad influences, such as Zhan Shaogang and He Qihao. Zhan is a native of Shaoxing and lives at No. 79 Mingyuanfang, Huade Road. At 6 p.m. the day before yesterday, Zhan was carrying Communist propaganda publications such as the Red Flag Daily, the Haiguang Daily, and pictures from his home, when he passed by the intersection of Huade Road and Huasheng Road. Just as Yangshupu police detective Xu Guirong and a Chinese and Western police officer were inspecting the area, Zhan threw away the printed materials in his hand and turned to flee. He was captured by the detectives and taken to the police station along with the newspapers. According to his confession, the newspapers and pictures were given to him by a Mr. Wang. When he left home, Wang was still in his residence with a man and two women. Western detectives went to his home to search for him, but they had all left. They then searched the house and confiscated the Haiguang Daily, pictures, leaflets, slogans, and eight or nine membership badges of the China Revolutionary Mutual Aid Society and the Shanghai General Federation. They took them to the police station and assigned a portion of the detectives to guard the house. Later, they took Zhan to the Shengdan Silk Factory, where Zhan pointed out that his fellow villagers He Qihao and Wu Aiwen, a 15-year-old girl from Shaoxing, were also accomplices. They were also arrested and sent to the Jiangsu Higher Branch Court yesterday. The police station lawyer Gan Jingxian filed a lawsuit against them based on Articles 6 and 10 of the Anti-Revolutionary Punishment Law and submitted the confiscated items to the court. Judge Du Fuyao interrogated the three defendants, Zhan and others, and ordered them to be detained separately for further questioning at a later date. At 9 a.m. yesterday, two more accomplices suddenly arrived at Zhan's residence at No. 79 and were arrested by the detectives guarding the house. Due to lack of time, they will be sent to the court for questioning today.</p>
<h3>Zhabei Replacing Old Fire Hydrants</h3>
<p>Zhabei Water and Electricity Company recently found that as the market in the city is becoming more and more prosperous, the original fire hydrants on each road either protrude into the road due to the narrowing of the road, which hinders traffic, or are located in unsuitable locations and need to be moved elsewhere. Moreover, fires have been occurring frequently recently, and often the water pressure is insufficient, making it impossible to extinguish them in time, which leads to the burning of houses. Therefore, they have specially ordered many 4-inch diameter hydrants from foreign countries to replace all the old hydrants in Zhabei that are not suitable for use. The original old hydrants had a large diameter of 3 inches and a small diameter of 2 inches. Now, the large diameter is being changed to 4 inches and the small diameter to 3 inches. Moreover, the base of the new hydrants is shorter than the old hydrants, and the water output is very high. The replacement is currently underway.</p>
<h3>French Concession Tramway to Re-lay Double Tracks</h3>
<p>Section from Rue Massenet to Route Ferguson</p>
<p>The French Concession's French Commercial Tramway and Electric Light Company plans to re-lay double tracks on the tram line on Avenue Joffre from Rue Massenet to Route Ferguson to facilitate traffic.

<h3>Villager's Home in Liuhang Township Robbed by Bandits</h3>
<p>Sun Lushan Injured and Killed</p>
<p>Sun Lushan, a 27-year-old villager from Sunjiazhai, west of Liuhang Township, Baoshan County, is a farmer. His family is well-off. At more than 7 p.m. the day before yesterday, Liu had already entered the room to sleep when he suddenly heard a knock on the door. Sun took a lamp and went out. As soon as he reached the main hall, he saw that the door had been broken open, and a large group of more than thirty bandits poured in, wearing black old military uniforms and speaking the Hakka dialect. Seeing Sun's arrival, the bandits took the initiative to fire a shot as a warning. Unexpectedly, the bullet was merciless and hit Lushan's stomach, causing blood to flow like a river. He fell to the ground. Bandits guarded the front and rear doors, while the remaining bandits broke into the inner room, overturning boxes and cabinets, and looting at will. The estimated loss was 120 yuan in cash and many clothes and jewelry. After half an hour, they escaped with their loot. Afterwards, the victim reported the incident to the Liuhang Public Security Bureau, which ordered the police to rush to the scene to apprehend the bandits. However, the bandits had already disappeared without a trace. The injured man hired a car to take him to the Tongren Hospital the next morning for treatment. After the doctor performed surgery and tried to remove the bullet, the gunshot wound had been too long, and there was too much blood loss, so he died at 11:30 p.m. last night.</p>
<h3>Collapse of Tianjing Xinfu Money Shop Involves Shanghai's Fang Anpu</h3>
<p>Limited Time to Go to Tianjin to Confront</p>
<p>Tianjin Xinfu Money Shop failed in business last year, and its economic turnover was not flexible, so it went bankrupt. The amount owed was about 270,000 yuan. The creditors suspected that the shareholders of the company had fraudulently obtained property and filed a lawsuit with the local judicial authorities. Recently, the Tianjin District Court Prosecutor's Office found out that Fang Anpu, the accounting director of the Shanghai Zheng Guanghe Soda Factory, was also one of the shareholders of Xinfu and sent a letter to the Special District Court to assist in the arrest and investigation. The Special Court issued a warrant to summon Fang, ordering him to pay a cash bail of 3,000 yuan and provide a guarantee from two shops, promising to be available whenever summoned. In addition to paying the cash bail in accordance with the order, Fang also asked the Nanjing Road Shi Weiji Clock Company and the Qiaoxingxiang Soda Factory to act as guarantors. However, the Special Court considered that the two shops could not bear the responsibility of guaranteeing and rejected the request, ordering him to find shops that could bear a guarantee of 100,000 yuan before he could be released. However, Fang Anpu did not have the ability to do so and was detained in the police station. Yesterday morning, Judge Ge Zhitan brought Fang to the court and told him, "This court has already telegraphed the Tianjin District Court to inquire about the qualifications of the guarantors. Now, according to the reply, they are satisfied with the guarantee provided by Shi Weiji and Qiaoxingxiang. You can ask the two shops to formally prepare a letter of guarantee for approval. After being released, you should immediately go to Tianjin to surrender yourself for questioning within the limited time." Fang's lawyer Zhang Deqin made a statement that the defendant was currently unwell and that the accounting duties he held at Zheng Guanghe needed to be cleared up for handover. The previous deadline was too short and it would be difficult to set off on time. He requested an extension of three weeks so that he could clear up his public and private affairs and then go to Tianjin to confront the charges. Judge Ge considered that the defendant's statement was true and granted the request.</p>
<h3>He Chuxiang Case of Killing His Wife in Anger Judged</h3>
<p>Mitigating Circumstances Allowed for Reduced Sentence</p>
<p>Sentenced to Twelve Years of Imprisonment</p>
<p>He Chuxiang, a native of Shaoxing, was forced to sell his wife due to poverty. Angered by his wife's lack of understanding, he wrote four suicide notes at 2:30 p.m. on New Year's Eve, bought and consumed opium wine, and then ran to his wife's new husband Chen Tianlin's house at No. 1148 Qipu Road with a sharp knife and killed his wife Hu. Chen Tianlin then handed him over to the police, who took him to the police station and transferred him to the Special District Court for questioning. The judgment date had been announced and published in this newspaper. Yesterday morning was the date for the judgment of this case. The police escorted He to the court, where Judge Feng announced the judgment, reducing the sentence to twelve years of imprisonment. The number of days of detention before the judgment was confirmed would be counted as one day of imprisonment for every two days of detention. The murder weapon, a knife, was confiscated. After the judgment was completed, he was told that according to the law, he should be sentenced to death, but considering the mitigating circumstances, the sentence was reduced. He listened obediently and did not express any disagreement. He was then taken back to the police station by the police to wait for confirmation before being sent to prison to serve his sentence.</p>
<h3>Child Avoids Car In Time</h3>
<p>Tragically Dies Under Wheels</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon around 4:15 PM, at the intersection of Route Lafayette and Rue du Marche in the French Concession, a loaded truck with license number 1682, carrying yellow sand and gravel, was passing through. Unexpectedly, a young child from Jiangbei nearby, running across the road, was unable to avoid it in time, and was struck and crushed in the head, instantly killing him. Officers on duty at the scene saw this, recorded the truck's license number, and reported it to the police station. The body was then taken to the Tongren Fu Yuan Tang mortuary for an autopsy, which is scheduled for today.</p>
<h3>Apprentice and Master's Concubine</h3>
<p>An Amusing Love Drama</p>
<p>Bian Mingsheng, who runs the Xinglong Automobile Shop at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Rue Auber, is about forty years old. His concubine, Madam Bian Zhu, is only twenty-one years old, with a very beautiful face. Bian himself kept her strictly guarded. Bian had an apprentice, Shen Senlin, twenty-three years old, who nevertheless frequented his master's chambers, disregarding all suspicion. An illicit affair ensued. Automobile drivers Pan Ouyi and Sun Lian San informed Bian, who learned of it. Because Bian's car was used every night for the dog racing business, he did not return home until one or two o'clock in the morning. He took Shen Senlin with him, but the night before last, Shen Senlin did not go. Around one o'clock in the morning, Bian returned home to his room and found Shen Senlin there. Bian, along with Pan Ouyi and Sun Lian San, caught them in the act and reported the case to the Third Precinct of the Fifth District. Yesterday, they were sent to the District Court. Prosecutor Li presided over the preliminary hearing. Bian Mingsheng claimed that his concubine was having an affair with his apprentice, and he had Ouyi and others as witnesses. The official said that current law adopts a monogamous system, so if she is a concubine, the husband has no right to sue and may even be punished. Madam Bian Zhu immediately claimed that she originally had a husband who runs a coal shop on Baoshan Road, and she became familiar with Bian Mingsheng before she married him, so later she hired a lawyer to publish a notice to dissolve the marital relationship with her original husband and follow Bian. Last night, she did not have an affair with the apprentice; she only called the apprentice to talk because she was lonely. Shen Senlin also denied the affair. According to the testimony of Pan Ouyi and Sun Lian San, when they went to catch them, their socks were not even on properly. The official then asked the plaintiff whether his concubine came to him out of love. Bian replied yes. The official then severely rebuked him, saying that he seduced a married woman to be his concubine. Although the defendants were shameless, the plaintiff himself was not innocent. He dismissed the case from the court. The law does not protect improper unions. The amusing case of the master-apprentice love affair thus came to an end.</p>
<h3>Tao the Immortal's Money Swindle</h3>
<p>Yuan Jiaqi's Inappropriate Behavior</p>
<p>Witchcraft to Cheat Money Truly Detestable</p>
<p>Madam Shen Chen, the wife of Shen Fuxing, a carpenter residing at No. 37 Jinlong Street, north of Dagou Bridge, had recently been suffering from liver and stomach problems. She heard people say that Tao the Immortal (male) at No. 461 Yuanhe Lane in the Old North Gate was good at using mysterious methods to treat all kinds of difficult and complicated diseases. He also set up a shrine, enshrining two clay statues, one called "Daddy" and the other "Little Sister," which were said to be extraordinarily efficacious. He also provided fortune sticks for those seeking guidance on lottery numbers, attracting a throng of superstitious people. Madam Shen Chen went behind her husband’s back for treatment. Tao the Immortal ordered her to burn incense and pray sincerely. Before long, Tao the Immortal began to yawn repeatedly, saying that Madam Shen Chen's family was being harassed by a fierce ghost. If she did not pray for resolution, one of her and her husband would surely die. Madam Shen Chen was shocked and asked how to pray. According to Tao the Immortal, she needed to invite eight Taoist priests to chant twenty-four volumes of the Great Sutra, each volume costing four yuan, for a total of ninety-six yuan. In addition, there were expenses for resolving the stars, sacrificial offerings, incense, candles, paper ingots, and lamp oil, totaling one hundred and thirty-six yuan and forty cents. Madam Shen Chen then secretly took ninety-six yuan, which her husband Shen Heshang had set aside for store expenses, and gave it to Tao the Immortal. The next day, she fasted and went to kowtow, only to see two Taoist priests chanting scriptures. Madam Shen Chen did not doubt it, because although Tao the Immortal was male, his speech and mannerisms were no different from a woman's. She then found another forty yuan and forty cents, and he told her, "Next year, on Daddy's birthday in the first month, bring your child to worship the Godfather, and he will ensure that you never get sick." Later, her husband Shen Heshang needed money to pay the rent, so he asked his wife for money. She said the money had been used, but never mentioned the prayers. Thereupon, Shen Heshang suspected that his wife was playing the lottery or had lost money gambling. A conflict arose between the couple. She was forced to confess the truth. Shen Heshang was never superstitious and knew that sorcerers specialized in swindling women out of money for their own extravagance. He was extremely angry. So yesterday afternoon at six o'clock, he took his wife, Madam Shen Chen, to Tao the Immortal’s place, intending to demand the return of the swindled money. Unexpectedly, Tao the Immortal suddenly claimed that he was Yuan Jiaqi, a businessman, not an immortal. Madam Shen Chen testified that this was true. Shen Heshang then turned over the "Daddy" and "Little Sister" idols and curtains in the parlor to the First Precinct of the Second District for investigation. Chief Qian interrogated Madam Shen Chen, who recounted the previous events. Yuan Jiaqi’s testimony was evasive. Yuan Jiaqi's behavior was inappropriate. There was no doubt that he was using mysterious witchcraft to swindle people out of money. He was sentenced to be sent to the Public Security Bureau along with all the witnesses to be dealt with according to the law.</p>
<h3>Commercial Press Compilation and Translation Department Opposes New Standards</h3>
<p>According to Guowen News Agency, Wang Xuewu, the general manager of the Commercial Press, after returning to Shanghai, imitated Western scientific management methods to formulate a set of trial regulations for the remuneration standards of the Compilation and Translation Department, consisting of twenty-six articles, which were promulgated on January 10 of this year, for a six-month trial period. After the promulgation of these new standards, the atmosphere in the company suddenly became tense. The workers' union of the Compilation and Translation Department convened an emergency meeting the day before yesterday, attended by more than two hundred and eighty people, chaired by Liu Nanhai. Party Representative He Yuanming from the Municipal Party Committee and representative Xu Zhi from the Social Affairs Bureau attended. After the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting, Social Affairs Bureau representative Xu said that these new standards came from Western capitalist countries and whether they could be applied to the countries that embraced the Three Principles of the People with an emphasis on the Principle of People’s Livelihood still needed to be studied. The following resolutions were passed: (1) Unanimously oppose the so-called new standards that are absolutely inconsistent with scientific methods. (2) Inquire of the director whether he can maintain his inherent powers; if not, a committee should be elected by the entire body to organize a compilation and translation conference to restore the original situation. (3) The general manager shall not interfere beyond his authority in the internal affairs of the Compilation and Translation Department. (4) Report the opinions of all colleagues to the board of directors. (5) Organize a special committee, etc. The notice issued by the Executive Committee of the Workers' Union of the Compilation and Translation Department is also recorded as follows: "According to the decision of the joint meeting of the Executive Committee, the new work standards of twenty-six articles promulgated by the General Affairs Office yesterday greatly hinder the welfare of colleagues. All unanimously deny it. In addition to sending a letter to General Manager Wang, asking him to automatically withdraw the regulations, we ask all members to continue working as usual. This is specially announced." In addition, the Joint Office of the Four Unions, composed of the Workers' Union of the Printing Office, the Workers' Union of the General Affairs Office, the Workers' Union of the Distribution Office, and the Workers' Union of the Compilation and Translation Department, issued a notice: "For the purpose of notification, it is hereby announced that since General Manager Wang replied to the nineteen articles and improvement conditions for the treatment of colleagues proposed by the four unions to the company, they have been studied and rejected. Now, the four unions have decided that before General Manager Wang sincerely accepts them, all kinds of new methods and rules related to the work of colleagues shall be suspended for the time being. Please all members continue to work as usual in order to negotiate. This matter concerns the welfare of the colleagues of the four unions, so please comply with it."</p>
<h3>Old Man Dies After Taking Poison</h3>

<h3>Water Police Captain Pays Attention to Winter Defense</h3>
<p>Since Captain Xie Baosheng took office in the First District, Third Team of the Water Police stationed in Gaochang Temple, he has been actively consolidating the defense, sparing no effort. Now that winter defense is critical, on the 14th of this month, he convened a meeting at the Gaochang Temple Headquarters with First Squad Leader Tang Siming, Second Squad Leader He Beizhi, and Third Squad Leader Zhou Liancheng to discuss that during this winter defense period, defense work must be given extra effort. In addition to complying with the joint defense measures decided by the District Department's winter defense meeting, the defense situation in each jurisdiction must be reported twice a week. If there are any bandit alerts, they should be immediately investigated and reported, and earnest pursuit should be carried out. He also ordered each squad leader to be stationed in their squad and not to leave without authorization, to emphasize their responsibilities. Fearing that the work of the squad police might still be negligent, Commander Zhou personally went to the defense areas of each squad every day from the 15th to inspect and assess in order to supervise and urge them.</p>
<h3>Mischievous Children Hanging on Carriages Cause Accidents</h3>
<p>Streetcar Hits People</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at four o'clock, at the intersection of Dongxin Bridge Street and Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession, an upper-class person about fifty years old was riding in a hired carriage from west to east when suddenly more than ten mischievous children hung onto the leather canopy at the back of the carriage. The coachman did not notice, causing the carriage to be pulled to the side. The person in the carriage and the coachman fell to the ground. At this time, a streetcar from the 16 Puli to Xujiahui was driving west. The driver saw the overturned carriage in the road. The driver did not stop in time and the passenger who had fallen was pushed four or five feet by the streetcar, causing his face and feet to bleed profusely. Afterwards, a patrolling officer saw this and helped the injured person up. He investigated the mischievous children who had hung on the carriage, but they had already taken the opportunity to escape, so he was unwilling to go to the police station. He used the original carriage to go home and went to the hospital for treatment.</p>

<h3>Women's Hair Found in Silk Reeling</h3>
<p>Silk Merchants Association Asks Factories to Pay Attention</p>
<p>Shen Huachen, chairman of the Shanghai Silk Mill Association, yesterday received a letter from the Shanghai Silk Merchants Export Association, stating: "According to letters from our members Yongxingtai, Luanan, Litai, Heli, Bailixiang, Maoxin, Xinfu, Shenyu, Renji, Xinglian, and Anqi foreign firms, etc., the Chinese silk reelings purchased by our firms for export, whether shipped to Europe or America, often found women's hair mixed in the reelings during spinning, which hinders the work. If manual selection is used, it is time-consuming and costly. If chemical methods are used to destroy human hair, it is feared that it will damage the quality of the silk. Therefore, we specially send a letter to your association, forwarding it to the Chinese Silk Merchants Association, asking you to immediately notify all silk reeling colleagues to pay special attention to management, prohibit female workers from combing their hair and cutting their hair during work, and strictly forbid discarding human hair in the reelings, so as to avoid Chinese silk reelings from being discredited and devalued in foreign markets." The association requested the above from Chairman Shen. Chairman Shen immediately notified all silk mill colleagues to investigate accordingly.</p>
<h3>Shaanxi Disaster Still Severe, Begging for Relief</h3>
<p>Shaanxi Chinese and Foreign Relief Association Repeatedly Sends Urgent Telegrams</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Relief Association previously had Luo Erxi, the general secretary of the Shaanxi Association, personally come to Shanghai to beg for relief, and mentioned that the original relief funds had been used for work-relief projects, but the harvest and the disaster situation were both beyond expectations, so the shelters had to continue to operate and maintain until the wheat harvest next spring. The Shanghai meeting decided to first remit ten thousand yuan specifically for sheltering disaster children and orphans, but the winter disaster situation is becoming more serious and urgent relief cannot be delayed. The repeated telegrams calling for help are recorded as follows: "(1) To the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association: The Shaanxi disaster is still becoming more serious. At this time of ice and snow, urgent relief cannot be ignored. We ask your association to quickly send a large sum of money to save the disaster victims. The merit is immeasurable. (2) We are deeply grateful for the ten thousand yuan you have given. However, the Shaanxi disaster is still severe and the tragic situation is overwhelming. At this moment of ice and snow, people are suffering from cold and hunger, and death is everywhere. It is painful to say. Winter relief is extremely urgent and cannot be delayed. We still ask your association to have compassion for the disaster victims and provide assistance again to save the survivors and complete the work." The Shaanxi Chinese and Foreign Relief Association heard that the association was concerned and considering all aspects and was quite anxious. It is deeply hoped that all major philanthropists will continue to provide assistance in a timely manner. This final assistance is even more of a life-saving grace.</p>
<h3>Bandit Imprisoned for Five Years</h3>

<h3>The Overseas Chinese Federation's Submission to the Central Government</h3>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Federation submitted a document to the central government agencies yesterday, stating: "Regarding the inaccurate reports in the newspapers, which have been corrected, we hereby reiterate the facts and request investigation and analysis." The Federation was humbly founded by the writer during the Xinhai Revolution, organized by the general representative of overseas Chinese, Wu Shirong, and others, upon the explicit instructions of the Generalissimo. On January 26th of the first year of the Republic of China, it was approved for registration by the Interior Minister under the command of the Generalissimo during his tenure as President. It gathered the strength of overseas Chinese to provide military supplies, as recorded in national and party history. When the Song case occurred, the entire overseas Chinese community was outraged. Chairman Wu Shirong and others announced the crimes of the traitor Yuan, which greatly angered the enemy party, leading to slander and sabotage. Chen Xinzheng, a revolutionary pioneer, repeatedly refuted the enemy party's arguments in newspapers, all of which are recorded in Chen Xinzheng's collected works. From a historical perspective, the Federation has never failed the party and the nation. After its establishment, it fought against the enemy party while supporting overseas Chinese, striving for overseas Chinese political rights, negotiating the Singapore, Haiphong, Jambi, and other massacres, abolishing the unequal Dutch treaties, protesting the harsh taxes in Dutch territories, requesting the maintenance of domestic and foreign civil post offices, requesting the reduction of overseas Chinese postal rates in Southeast Asia, requesting the revision of the Foreign Ministry's passport law, requesting aid for the Kunshan fire disaster, requesting the amendment of the Dutch regulations insulting clause "Chinese Assimilation to Indigeneous Peoples", requesting the regulation of the number of overseas Chinese representatives in the National Assembly, and assisting overseas Chinese who were killed, defiled, persecuted, or kidnapped. All efforts were for the public good. From a work perspective, the Federation has never failed the overseas Chinese community. Unexpectedly, it was doubted and even accused. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Central Government used a submission from an unknown person as evidence that the Federation was a preparatory society without verifying the source of the submission or determining whether it was true. It immediately requested its dissolution, which seemed excessively unjust. Fortunately, the Commission and the Executive Yuan of the National Government cautiously ordered an investigation. The Shanghai Municipal Government, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the Public Security Bureau dispatched investigators in accordance with the law, allowing for the clarification of the facts and the lifting of the injustice. Otherwise, the injustice reported in the newspapers would not only burden the Qingming party rule with imagined crimes and imprisonments, but also affect legal rights. In order to clarify the truth, we respectfully submit the following to the Commission: (1) The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission's original submission only cited reports stating: 'The Overseas Chinese Federation of the Republic of China Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission has recently expanded its operations, causing the original premises to be insufficient for office use. It plans to build a federation headquarters in Shanghai, establishing organizations such as the Overseas Chinese Student Association, the Overseas Chinese Introduction Center, the Overseas Chinese Reception Center, and the Overseas Chinese Industry Group. It also plans to build branch offices in Xiamen, Shantou, Guangzhou, and other areas. The construction cost for this project is estimated at 600,000 yuan, which the Overseas Chinese Federation has requested overseas Chinese in Singapore and other parts of Southeast Asia to raise funds.' Based on this, the submission inferred that the Federation was using the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission's name to deceive overseas Chinese. However, reports in newspapers are prone to errors. Unless the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission intentionally pursued this matter, it should first investigate whether the Federation displayed the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission's signboard, whether the news was issued by the Federation, whether the Federation's envelopes, letterhead, seals, and documents used the name of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, and whether it sent a letter or telegram to Singapore and other places to request fundraising for construction expenses. It should also investigate whether anyone or any group in Singapore and other places received a request from the Federation using the name of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission to raise construction funds. If this is the case, then the situation is true and the crime is justified, and we will not accept the punishment. If this is not the case, then the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission's assertion in its presentation that 'its actions are undoubtedly outside the bounds' is based on erroneous speculation and is indeed questionable. Since it is questionable, isn't the Shanghai Municipal Government's reply a reasonable and appropriate compromise? The Federation, with its twenty-year history, organized for the sake of the Party and fighting for the Party, a society without guilt and without transgressions, to repeatedly insist on dissolving the Union, will be misunderstood as being fiercely anti-Dutch and that someone wants to take this opportunity to avenge the Netherlands. Overseas Chinese groups at home and abroad, seeing that the Federation, loyal and condemned, is not dissolved by Yuan Shikai whom we opposed, not dissolved by the warlords we attacked, but dissolved today by our party that we support to unify the country, will also feel suspicious and insecure. This is one aspect for your careful consideration regarding the facts of this case. (2) The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission's original submission stated that the Federation 'is a small number of idle people, under the pretense of a name, hoping to profit.' We do not know what the basis is. The Federation's officers and members mostly have legitimate occupations and are mostly members of the Party, who have only sacrificed for the Federation and have never profited from it. Even taking the most foolish Ji Gong for example, in the year of Yimao, he organized a democratic state with Tang Jingsong and others in Taiwan, resisting Japanese soldiers for three years. When the Generalissimo arrived in Taiwan, he taught them day and night. His revolutionary thoughts were no less than those of the officials of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. During the Wuchang Uprising, he and other revolutionary overseas Chinese formed the Federation to raise funds and provide aid. After Dun Gong was assassinated, he followed the Generalissimo's instructions and conspired with Mr. Keqiang and others to launch the Second Revolution, providing assistance to Han Hui and Xu Qiwen to attack Gaochang Temple. Following the martyrs Chen Yingshi and Minister Niu Yongjian, he plotted to attack Zheng Ruicheng but was eventually discovered by the traitor Zheng, who sent troops to arrest Ji. He was subjected to severe torture five times, almost dying. After being released from prison, he fled to Tokyo. He received an order from the Generalissimo to return to China to work, saying, 'With every ounce of energy, do a part of the cause. With every penny, help comrades to start an uprising. Who has merit and who has guilt, will be judged after death.' Ji was deeply moved and ordered his wife, Huang Danzhi, to return to Taiwan, pawn off their property, and use the proceeds to participate in the assassination of Zheng Ruicheng and the bombing of the arsenal. Later, with the assistance of Wu Shirong of the Federation, he went to Fujian to mobilize the people's army to attack Li Houji until Yuan died. When Borodin vigorously promoted communism in Hanyang, he conspired with his party comrades to drive him out, agreeing with Yang Qichang and Liu Zuolong to start an uprising at a fixed time. However, Yang's army departed from Qingshan to Xujiapeng, and Liu Zuolong did not fire his artillery as agreed, leading to failure. Yang's army was disarmed by Zhang Fashi, and Ji was arrested and imprisoned. Fortunately, Mr. Sun Zhesheng, Shen Zhuowu, and others rescued him, and he escaped disaster. In this way, how could he have failed the party and the nation after going through nine deaths and one life? If such is said to be 'idle', then must everyone be an official to be considered 'useful'? This is the second point for your careful consideration regarding the Federation's officers. (3) The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission stated that the Federation's sub-branch in Jakarta 'widely recruited members and heavily collected membership fees.' The sub-branch has been established there for ten years and has been a member of the Federation for less than two years. It is heard that their actions are not appropriate, and a letter has been sent to correct them. If they do not repent, then a denial will be published in the newspaper. Regardless of administrative or judicial penalties, there is no way that the dissolution of the general branch will be given due to one faulty branch. Similarly, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission once had a hired employee with outrageous behavior. As a result, only the employee was dismissed, and no one recklessly suggested dissolving the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. Because a small number cannot harm the majority. However, the branch in Siam only requested to stop the actions of the sub-branch, while the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission went a hundred steps further and asked for the dissolution of the Federation, which seemed like an excuse to take revenge. This is the third point for your careful consideration regarding the cautious rewarding and punishing. (4) The purpose of the Federation's constitution is to 'instill the Three Principles of the People.' Based on this purpose, the Federation has spared no economic sacrifice or mental exertion in initiating an anti-Dutch movement to express its determination to protect the Party in response to the Dutch government's prohibition of textbooks on the Three Principles of the People, its prohibition of holding memorial weeks for the Generalissimo, its arrest of the Party's committee members, and its expulsion of the editors of our Party's newspapers. However, the Federation's monthly expenses average only about 200 yuan, and its daily work often extends to 9 or 10 p.m. All this hard work can be reported to the Generalissimo and the martyrs. We did not expect to be wronged for the Party and to suffer for the country, only to please the Dutch, which is tantamount to helping the enemy to promote their cause. This is the fourth point for your careful consideration regarding the purpose of the Federation. Other reasons will not be stated in detail. The original corrected text is attached. We respectfully request your review and approval. Xu Ji Gong, Acting Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Federation. Attachment: one copy of the original corrected text (omitted).</p>

<p>Farmer: I've been raising this pig for three years! It cost me a lot of money and effort.</p>
<p>Driver: Don't get upset. I'll compensate you.</p>
<p>Farmer: But you look so skinny. Not as plump as my pig!</p>

<p>Man: My love, I'm praising your temper. Why are you so unhappy?</p>
<p>Woman: When a man doesn't praise a woman's looks but her temper, it means he thinks she's not very pretty.</p>

<h3>A Record of Ms. Wang's Elopement</h3>
<p>Zhu Ming</p>
<p>My father returned south. In his luggage was a poem I wrote on Wang Gengyan's "Three Friends of Winter and Rock Painting." One verse said: "I heard that the old sword fits in Yan Jin. The orchid blooms in the courtyard. Xiang Ping will prepare for his old age. He doesn't need the Five Mountains to support his poetry cane." It referred to a very new and interesting elopement story. In recent elopements, the directors are usually the lovers. But Ms. Wang is different. This is worth writing about.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Gengyan was an official in the Qingdao court. He had a wife and a concubine when he was in Anhui. The wife had one daughter, who was already married. The concubine had one daughter and three sons. The daughter had already graduated from middle school. Gengyan arranged a marriage for her with someone named Mou, setting a date without the daughter's consent. The daughter thought her stubborn father couldn't be reasoned with, so she took her mother and brothers away. No one knew where they went. People said the daughter must have run away with her lover. In this trend, it was nothing strange. But something unexpected happened. The daughter actually supported herself. Having graduated from middle school, she had a good foundation in Chinese and English. She consulted her teachers and friends and stopped in Jiangsu to become a primary school teacher. With her salary, she supported her mother and brothers. Not only did she not have a lover, but she never mentioned marriage. When the revolutionary army rose, she joined the revolutionary work. From Jiangsu to Guangdong, and then from Guangdong to Beijing, she served in the Capital Public Security Bureau. Because she ran away from home and fought for freedom of marriage, she held herself to high standards and rarely approved of others. It was then that she met a gentleman from Zhejiang. They had a romantic relationship, and she gradually intended to commit herself to him. But they were separated by thousands of miles, and she hadn't heard from her father. When the situation stabilized, she finally found her father's whereabouts. She took her mother and brothers back home. She had been away for eight years. Her mother was old, and her brothers had grown up. Then her story became clear. Last year, in a certain month, she was married by her father. She held a wedding in the capital with the gentleman. She was different from the common people. Ms. Wang used the name Jiang Jihua when she was teaching in Jiangsu. Because her surname was related to my family, I was happy to write about it.</p>
<h3>On the Thirtieth of the First Month of the Twentieth Year, I Waited for the Moon with Mo Jun at the Zhenjiang Pavilion in Jiaoshan, and It Rained, Showing the Guests Who Toured With Us</h3>
<p>Shao Yiru</p>
<p>I once stayed at Songliao Nunnery.</p>
<p>Drunk, I watched the cold jade purify the river pool.</p>
<p>I called my wife to get up and sit up in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>I searched for sentences, wanting to explore the stars.</p>
<p>Three years have passed, trapped by dust and hunger.</p>
<p>The car tracks are noisy, alas, I am not familiar.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I was able to rest during the New Year.</p>
<p>So I put on my straw shoes and walked through the frosty forest.</p>
<p>The strict cold is so cold that all the trees are dead.</p>
<p>Only the ice calyx has a strong fragrance.</p>
<p>Jiao Shan's mountain spirits are old acquaintances.</p>
<p>There were also two or three guests with me on the tour.</p>
<p>The old monk opened the room and greeted me to sit down.</p>
<p>We shared the wonderful ink to open the golden letter.</p>
<p>The brushwork is vertical and horizontal, and the interest is unrestrained.</p>
<p>The Zen machine is subtle, and the creation is involved.</p>
<p>At night, I opened the door and looked at the sky.</p>
<p>The river moon did not come out, and the mountain rain was heavy.</p>
<p>Listening to the rain in Zhenjiang is also pure and beautiful.</p>
<p>Why must the brilliance of the moon be indulged?</p>
<p>How many months does a person have in his life?</p>
<p>Waiting for the moon and getting rain tastes even more mellow.</p>
<p>It's like a strange article spitting out dangerous monsters.</p>
<p>The women take away the ease and fight for the steepness.</p>
<p>At dawn, the light pouring over the river is dazzling.</p>
<p>The bright sun rises and illuminates the sparse shrine.</p>
<p>I was more excited to go to Nanjiao South.</p>
<h3>Frostbite</h3>
<p>Ms. Ye Hua</p>
<p>Dr. Fei Kunian returned from Germany and Austria where he practiced medicine. Yesterday, he came to my house to enjoy the snow scene. On the way, my family asked about frostbite. He told us about it. This is what I recorded.</p>
<p>Frostbite is commonly known as dead blood. It is also called frostbite. Frostbite is easy to occur in parts of the body that are bound or under pressure, such as the toes, heels, and ankle joints. The ears, nose, face, and hands, which cannot be covered by clothing, are also its main camps. After suffering, the affected area first appears pale white. As the blood vessels become paralyzed, it turns blue-red. Then it swells and becomes numb and itchy. This phenomenon is greatly relieved when the temperature is too high. The numbness and itching are especially severe. Finally, it ulcerates and ruptures. If it is exposed to the cold again, it will lead to gangrene. It is difficult to treat with medicine.</p>
<p>Cause: The cause of this sore is not uniform. Most of them are due to anemia. Chlorosis. Insufficient daily food intake. Often feel hungry. Drinking too much alcohol. Smoking excessively. Suffering from typhoid fever. Suffering from cholera. Suffering from dysentery. As a result, the ability to resist the cold is reduced. The sore then invades. Those on the feet are due to inappropriate shoes. Or too small. Or the straps are too tight. Or the socks are too thin. As a result, it irritates the local area. The blood vessels are not harmonious. Frequent people who are often obese suffer from frostbite. Because their movements are slow. This hinders blood circulation.</p>
<p>Treatment: The patient should elevate the affected area. Rub it with snow ice cold products. To activate blood vessels. If you use hot products. On the contrary, it increases discomfort. Therefore, it should be banned. Usually at home. Each part of the hands and feet. Can be washed and wiped with alternating hot and cold baths. The method is to use two basins. One is filled with hot water at 38 to 40 degrees. One is filled with cold water at 10 to 15 degrees. First, immerse the affected area in the hot water basin for two minutes. Then immerse it in the cold water basin for half a minute. Then return to the hot water basin. Repeat like this. About four to six times. Only the last time must be in the cold water basin. Another method is to use hot water only. The temperature is at least 39 and up to 42 degrees. Put oak bark, or bran, or soda, or alum, or rice bran in the water. Choose one to take a bath with. The above two methods can be used at the same time. It is also impossible. Expose the sores to the sun every day. Also a good method. Artificial sun lamps and electrical massage. The fastest effect. It can be cured after five or six treatments. Even if it has been broken. It can still be treated. If frostbite is caused by anemia or typhoid fever. Then treat the source of the disease first. The best policy. There are countless frostbite creams sold on the market. Ungt. Cerussal Camphoratu and Tannic Ointment are better.</p>

<h3>Massage Examination</h3>
<p>Qiu Shui</p>
<p>Massage. In English, it's called Massage, derived from the Greek. It means rubbing. In ancient Greece, when people encountered various illnesses, before undergoing significant medical procedures, they often used massage to treat them. In Germany, where medical science is most developed, when people occasionally suffer from colds, constipation, liver disease, kidney disease, or skin diseases, they often use massage as a trial method before using medicine. This is quite remarkable. It is said that the art of massage originated in China. (Note by the translator: In China, it's called Tui Na). Its invention period was around 3000 BC. Later, the Indians spread it (around 700 BC), and then the Romans. The Romans used it to treat warriors who suffered skin injuries during wars. Later, the Greeks obtained the method and regarded it as a panacea, using it to treat various diseases. However, after the birth of Jesus, the people of Europe and the West rarely used it. It was not until 1776 that a physical education expert named Henrik Ling rose up and advocated the art of massage. He set up a massage clinic in Stockholm (the capital of Sweden) specifically for athletes with various skin, muscle, and bone injuries. This was the beginning of massage clinics being established all over the world. Later, Professors Engerman and Zabudovsk successively promoted it, and it became popular for a time. Today, in remote streets and alleys, there are many white boards wildly scribbled with the words "Massage Clinic." Within, there are layers of darkness, using medicine as a guise to do all kinds of evil. How can this be counted? It is far beyond what the original advocates had anticipated. Is it not sad? Considering the art of massage, it was initially one of the medical arts. When used correctly, it is miraculously effective. When used incorrectly, it can cause endless harm. I advise those who are enthusiastic about massage at sea not to lightly experiment with their precious bodies. The translator notes: The author of this article is Mr. Nai Qi. The original article was published in the North China Daily News. I happened to see that his words were enough to satirize the world, so I translated it to show it to the Chinese people.</p>
<h3>Parisian Tales</h3>
<p>Six, Living in Paris</p>
<p>Returning to the city, she became more and more dissolute. She started drinking heavily and wandered the streets every day without a penny. When it snowed, she took refuge in small hotels where people would buy her a drink and ask her to tell them about her last night with the condemned prisoner. One night, in such circumstances, she ran into her former fiancé. The man was moved with compassion and wanted to take her back, but people laughed at him and tried to stop him from going with her.</p>
<p>Toniska ran out of the hotel and was trampled by a horse in the street. She slowly died in her fiancé's arms.</p>
<p>The plot of the film is roughly like this. I have summarized it a bit too simply, but even from this simple narration, it is clear that the content of the film is very sad. The condemned prisoner's last night and the executioner's anticipation, etc., can be said to have left an indelible record in the history of cinema.</p>
<p>The appearance of a great artist added much more brilliance to this film. We had previously seen Ms. Ita Rina's beautiful figure in "Erodiade". In "Toniska", she fully demonstrated her many advantages. The role of Toniska was originally very difficult to play, but Lilla did it so well, simple, natural, and tragic. Her beauty does not need praise. What is most touching is her innate talent for tragedy.</p>

<p>At that time, Sun Qilei continued, "In recent years, Mr. Ren has experienced many things, especially regarding the events since the revolution. If you bring out the material in your stomach, it would be an excellent historical novel. If Mr. Ren wrote it, it would be even more moving." Ren Peiqi held a pair of small silver wine glasses and took a sip of brandy, saying, "It's a pity that my writing skills are not good enough. I can't write things. If it's about material, I have plenty in my stomach. There are also many that are very secret, which outsiders would never know. However, that kind of news cannot be published, so I have to keep it to myself. Unless it reaches a certain period, it can be announced. But there are also many that are all so-called ugly histories of those great men, so I can only hide their evils and promote their virtues." Sun Qilei said, "Mr. Ren, why don't you tell our poet Shi Chen some stories? He is very happy to write novels. Instead of fabricating ideas, it is better to describe the real events of recent years. I know that picking them up at random would be excellent novel material." The person next to him, Long Ziyun, said, "Mr. Ren initially organized the Women's Revolutionary Army and later fought for women's suffrage. I think he must have experienced a lot. I think just the material on Mr. Ren himself would probably be enough to write hundreds of thousands of words." Long Ziyun seemed to want to make a big speech again. Zuo Shi Chen quickly stopped him with his eyes, and Long Ziyun did not dare to continue. Ren Peizhen then took another sip of brandy. There was already only half a glass left in that cup. Zuo Shichen looked at Luyi, and Luyi understood and quickly raised the bottle of brandy and filled Ren Peizhen's cup. It turned out that Ren Peizhen had already drunk the fourth cup since coming here. Whether he had drunk elsewhere, I don't know. He heard Long Ziyun say this and picked up the glass of brandy that Luyi had just filled and took a big gulp, drinking away half of it, and a circle of red appeared on his face. He put down his glass and sighed, "Indeed, I have been in the political world for the past few years and have not achieved anything. However, I have pierced through all their paper tigers. What is called revolution is completely selfish and self-serving. In the past, those corrupt officials were called 'skin scrapers.' Now, look at those warlords, they are simply 'land scrapers.' In the future, I am afraid they will even resort to 'territory scraping.' The word 'revolution' is to deceive those old people. But the old people are not so easily deceived. Have they not felt anything after suffering at your hands? However, under heavy pressure, they cannot speak out. This cannot be hidden from you gentlemen. You gentlemen are all pioneers in the press and know much more than I do. As for us women, what are we fighting for when we fight for suffrage? We also know that it is very far away. However, gender equality is also one of the slogans. Now, we women, after the revolution, may I ask you gentlemen, what benefits have we gained?"</p>

<h3>Gold Market on the Financial Swap Date</h3>
<p>With Strong Advances and Retreats</p>
<p>Many parties in the swap market posted the gold price situation on January 16 yesterday. The violent change, with forwards retreating and strong advances and retreats, presented a reversal after a sharp rise. Coinciding with the start of the swap, the exchange opened at 8:30 AM. The February-March swap was posted by many parties, initially at 4 taels and 56 mace to 5 taels. Subsequently, it was quoted at 4 taels and 7 mace, then estimated at over 5 taels. At noon, it was 5 taels, but there were no term transactions, and it was canceled as usual. However, the opening price was 733 taels and 8 mace, and the closing price at noon was 743 taels and 8 mace, an increase of 10 taels and 08 mace compared to the day before yesterday. It was transferred according to the March term. After noon, it was generally changed to the March term without quotation.</p>
<p>The March Market Undergoes a Drastic Change. The March term has already entered the market. Transactions among colleagues were relatively agile. Xinxing, Yifeng, Yongheng, Xingyuan, etc., all bought in, while Fuchang, Yuanheng, Zhifeng, Yongchang, Sheng Yong, etc., all sold off. The chaos of the situation surpassed the previous one. Bad mixed with good, fluctuations ranging from 3-4 taels to 6-7 taels. The total market fluctuated by as much as 20 taels, making people lose their will. The violent storm showed no sign of stopping. Almost as if the foreign exchange was trending towards tension, the contract was reduced by half a point. Although the overseas silver market has rebounded, it did not move, presumably because the US selling intentions were unabated, so the gold price was not affected. Subsequently, buyers were diligent, flying high, soaring by more than ten taels, suddenly breaking through the 750 taels mark, and opening up a new era of 753 taels, an unprecedented feat. Afterwards, it advanced and retreated sporadically, and the complexity was endless. In the after-market, various firms had an oversupply, so the market situation showed a reactionary plunge of more than ten taels and then breaking within the 740 taels mark. However, the changes were very rapid, and the final count was between 35 taels. Almost as if the draft has slightly loosened. Given the recent surge in gold, crises are lurking everywhere. Are there fears of major changes in the future?</p>
<p>High Prices Appeared in the Early Morning. The March contract opened at 738 and a half taels in the early morning (the gross price was initially within 30 taels, but it was not easy to buy. It rose to 38-39 taels in an instant, so there were quite a few buyers). The large bars rose by 16/7, the long-term rose by 3/8, and the silver price also rose by 3/8. Foreign telegrams only added 25, so people's hearts were not moved. Subsequently, because Wanxing, Yifeng, Yongshunli, etc., bought aggressively, it jumped thousands of feet in an instant, reaching 53 taels. There were only two or three taels of difference. The foreign exchange market was also firm. In April, British gold was offered by Shanghai McAlister, etc., at 13125, and in February, the silver price was done against 125. After entering, Fuchang Yuanheng, etc., sold off, and it immediately fell by 7-8 taels, counted as 45 taels, and then added 7 taels, counted as 52 taels. The first order was announced at 50 taels and change, and the listing was reduced by 125, US dollars 25, Japanese gold plus one and a half cents, but the gold market was flat, followed by 48 and a half taels, and the domestic market stabilized. Retail investors, etc., bought in, and at 9:45 it was increased to 52 and a half taels. Hua Bi offered Dalian March at 1 tael 6 mace 1 cent 75, Hua Bank traded against English gold in January at 131875. Subsequently, McAlister offered 13115 in March. The Dalian gangs Zhifeng and Yong, etc., all sold off, so after 10 o'clock it fell back to 45 taels, then there were five or six taels of fluctuations, until 11 o'clock it was 44 and a half taels, goods hedged and Fuxing Yong, etc., sold out, but all foreign exchanges did not change. At this time, Hengxingyuan came in, jumping more than 7 taels, counting as 52 taels, and goods, etc., went out again, at 11:30 it was 46 taels, and then added four taels, counting as 50 taels, but it was confusing and difficult to grasp. By the time the noon market closed at 48 taels and 8 mace, it had fallen to 44-45 taels again, goods and Wanxing sold out, so goods closed at 46 and a half taels, and the announced price had been changed to 786 taels and 6 mace, which was the Japanese gold listing one and a half cents higher, counting 36-37 taels outside 40 taels, and noon closed at 37-38 taels.</p>
<p>The Downstream Trend in the Afternoon. The after-market opened at 46 and a half taels (the gross price was 44-45 taels to 7 taels). Subsequently, because major firms such as Zhifengyong, Fuchang, Chang Shengyong, Heng Xingyuan, Zhaokang, etc., tended to sell, it fell by more than five taels. At 2:15, it was 41 taels, then it rose by a full four and a half taels, and then because Yuan Maoyong, Yu Da, etc., came to sell, and also the English gold loosened, in January, Shanghai Mitsui traded against 131875, and Holland Hua Bi Chengwen exchanged in March 25. Until 3:00, the 40 taels mark was broken, counting as 39 taels. In an instant, Yuan Xingyong bought in, and in half an hour it returned to a high of five and a half taels, counting as 44 taels and 5 mace. Subsequently, there were three and a half taels of ups and downs, from 41 taels to four and a half taels. Almost all foreign exchanges were frustrated. The Sino-Japanese Bank traded US dollars in March at 31 yuan 0625. Then, in the You [name illegible], a first order of 1325. After 4 o'clock, Yu Ren, Zhaokang, Fuxingyong sold off aggressively, and the market atmosphere suddenly fell into a tired state, with a plunge of ten taels. At 4:20, it was 34 taels, then added 2 taels, and by the time the market closed at 4:30 it was 35 and a half taels, again suppressed to 34 taels. The highest price of the day was 753 taels, the lowest price was 734 taels, with a difference of 19 taels. The announced price was suppressed by nearly forty taels to fifty-one or two taels. On the ledger, the morning February was 44 taels, March was 49 taels, the afternoon was 39 taels to 44 taels, and the water supplement was 44 taels, the afternoon goods were 39 taels, the morning closed at 46 and a half taels, and the afternoon closed at 6 o'clock was 33 and a half taels.</p>
<p>The United Gang Bought More and Sold Less. According to the transactions of each firm, Dadecheng, Yuancheng, Xinheng, Hengxing, Yifengyong, Heng Xingyuan bought in; Shunli, Wanxing, bought more and sold less; Chang Shengyong, Zhifengyong, Fuchang, Yuanheng all sold off; the goods bought and sold irregularly; Yuantai, Yu Da, Taikangrun, sometimes sold and sometimes accepted. In the afternoon, Taikangrun, Shunli, Wanxing, Hengxing, Yuan Xingyong all bought in; Zhifengyong, Chang Shengyong, Fuchang, Chengfengyong, Zhaokang, Yu Da, Heng Xingyuan, Fuxingyong all sold off; the goods had irregular ups and downs. The Dalian gang entered more than 2,000 items in the morning market and sold more than 1,000 items. In the after-market, they bought 2,000 items and sold more than 1,000 items. The Guangdong gang made a slight purchase, it is said.</p>

<p>Yesterday, it was suddenly reported that the British and American silver markets showed signs of rising, but there were not many transactions, and sellers were still concentrated. The United States still had some sales. The British and American exchange rate slightly decreased, and the Kobe and Yokohama markets remained mediocre. Almost as if the HSBC listing's various exchanges tended to shrink, calculated as half a point. For example, British gold shrank by 125, currently one shilling and three pence, which has revealed a new record. US dollars shrank by 25, calculated as 30 yuan and 0375, Indian exchange 75, calculated as 84 rupees 25 francs 6 yuan, calculated as 774 yuan, and foreign exchange 75, calculated as 75 taels 25, German exchange did not change, still 128 marks 75, Singapore exchange added one and a half taels, calculated as 185 taels 25, Hong Kong did not move, calculated as 76 and a half taels, Japanese gold rose one and a half cents, calculated as one tael six mace three cents two five.

The after-market suddenly retreated to within the 744 taels mark, with a difference of 19 taels throughout the day. The huge waves were difficult to suppress. The dangerous situation, I do not know where it will end. However, the market did not change too much. Chinese merchants, speculators, and gold businesses all started to buy in. It is estimated that 300,000 pounds of English gold were traded. Banks such as Shanghai, Mitsui, McAlister, Sumitomo, etc., all sold off.

Comparing each exchange's closing price to the day before, it is estimated that British gold still shrank by 0625, US dollars shrank by 1875, and Japanese gold decreased by half a cent.

<h3>Tense Situation Remains in Yarn Market</h3>
<p>The yarn market opened steady in the morning, but prices rose at noon, and the situation remained tense. Most people expect prices to rise further. Due to high gold prices, the prices of imported goods have soared, making it uneconomical to import them into China. Compared to imported yarn, domestic yarn is much cheaper. Therefore, as soon as prices drop, buyers flock to purchase it. Furthermore, Hengde Company has made substantial profits from cotton and has already changed its strategy, liquidating a large amount of cotton and purchasing standard yarn, totaling over 10,000 bales in two days. However, sellers such as Chao Bang and Japanese merchants remain inactive. Because large transactions of spot yarn have just taken place, the market is currently quiet and shows no signs of improvement. It is said that short-selling of distant months continues.</p>
<p>Nearby Months Decline, Distant Months Rise in Man Label Yarn Futures</p>
<p>The Man Label yarn futures market opened with gold prices rising, and confidence remained strong, with prices rising by 0.03 to 0.04 taels. In the second and third rounds of trading, Xincheng Company sold in large quantities, causing the market to plummet, resulting in declines of 0.02, 0.03, 0.05, and 0.08 taels respectively. In the afternoon, standard yarn suddenly became tight, and the market soared as Xincheng Company re-entered the market. Long positions in nearby months were mostly liquidated at break-even, while distant months rose by 0.08 taels to 1.23 taels. The total trading volume for the day was 51,700 bales. It was found that Xincheng sold 3,300 bales, Yiyu 1,400 bales, and Daji 1,400 bales. The buyers were Meiji 1,650 bales, Tiancheng 1,150 bales, Yuda 1,400 bales, Gengfeng 1,150 bales, Hengde 4,300 bales, Changfeng 1,750 bales, and Xiesheng 1,350 bales. The closing prices of Man Label yarn futures are listed below:</p>
<p>Man Label Yarn Futures Closing Prices, Gains/Losses, and Open Interest</p>
<p>January 1497 Rise 0.05  31,200 April 1541 Rise 0.08 66,300</p>
<p>February 1511 Fall 0.05 61,100 May 1551 0.07 14,700</p>
<p>March 1530 Rise 0.10 71,000 June 1555 0.09 31,950</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales remain good, with various firms buying a total of 1,200 bales throughout the day. Domestic firms purchased 390 bales, and the market price rose by 0.05 taels. Customer firms from inland areas purchased 185 bales, Jiangxi 220 bales, Sichuan 255 bales, Shantou 55 bales, Shenxin 250 bales, and other firms 150 bales.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Increasingly Strong</h3>
<p>Han firms Take the Opportunity to go Short</p>
<p>The rising trend in the cotton market is intensifying, mainly due to the continued rise in gold prices, causing panic among retail investors and further tightening the market. Japanese merchants are also exporting machinery cotton, further increasing market tension. Han firms are taking this opportunity to short-sell 50,000 to 60,000 piculs. Hengde Company is liquidating long positions, approximately 20,000 to 30,000 piculs per day, while most retail investors are inclined to go long. This situation is the opposite of what it was before. In summary, with the volatile gold prices, it is difficult for the cotton market to stabilize.</p>
<p>Futures Continue to Rise by 0.03 taels</p>
<p>The Han Label cotton futures market opened with gold prices rising, and confidence remained strong, with prices rising by 0.02 taels. In the second round of trading, prices declined slightly, resulting in gains of 0.01 to 0.02 taels. In the afternoon, the market became even stronger, with the opening momentum being sharp, rising another 0.02 taels. Later, as long positions were sold off, the gains eased slightly, resulting in gains of 0.005 to 0.025 taels. The total trading volume for the day was 157,800 piculs. It was found that Hengde sold 14,100 piculs, Xincheng 5,700 piculs, Jifeng 3,800 piculs, Tianlong 3,200 piculs, and Tianchang 3,200 piculs. The buyers were Gongtai 9,800 piculs, Yichang 5,000 piculs, Lianji 5,300 piculs, Tongxing 4,800 piculs, and Maoji 4,900 piculs. The closing prices of Han Label cotton futures are listed below:</p>

<p>March 3600 0.030 194,900 June 3500 0.030 81,400</p>
<p>The Spot Market Shows Slight Improvement</p>
<p>The business of spot cotton from factories remains flat. However, Japanese merchants are conducting some transactions. The sources are 600 bales of Tong Cotton, 800 bales of Yao Cotton, and 37 piculs of Shaanxi Cotton. Hongzhang Factory purchased 250 pieces of spot Shaanxi Cotton at 36.50. Xiefeng Factory purchased 100 pieces of spot Shaanxi Cotton at 25.75. Dacheng Factory purchased 100 pieces of spot machinery cotton at 34.25 delivered to the warehouse.

<h3>Grain Market: Sharpening Decline in HeXia Rice Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there was a large arrival of goods at Hexia, with over 100 boats. Sales were very slow, and the decline in Northern Japonica rice intensified. Prices of better-quality rice fell by 0.20 yuan, while medium-quality rice needed a 0.30 yuan discount. Top-grade rice was priced at only 13.80 yuan. Thin-husked rice followed the Japonica rice trend downwards, with sluggish buying interest and a continuous drop of over 0.20 yuan. Yangdu Indica rice has become thicker, and sales are gradually slowing, with prices down by 0.15 yuan. The situation in the port area is still acceptable, and quotations in the interior remain stable, with a slight price decrease of around 0.10 yuan. Transactions of Yuan Diao embryo rice are still active, and although arrivals continue, prices are not easily lowered. Top-grade rice is still priced at around 13.40 yuan. Yin Yuan rice is slightly lower, with few transactions. Among the general market, White Yuan rice is considered to be [missing word].</p>
<p>Yesterday, 30-40 boats arrived from various firms in South Shanghai, and sales became even more sluggish. Changshu and Xixiang Machine Japonica rice was selected and purchased at a discount of 0.20 yuan by local distributors. Suzhou and Tong White Japonica rice sales were sluggish both in retail and rural areas, with prices falling by 0.20-0.30 yuan. The market for Southern firms' thin early rice remains weak, and buyers are reluctant to purchase due to small quantities. Special grades are gradually declining. Top early rice is priced at around 12 yuan. Yang Indica rice is still in good condition, and the situation is similar to Du Jian rice, with prices falling by 0.10 yuan. Sales of Yin Yuan rice for customer and wine production are frequent, with the initial quotation being high and subsequent reductions.</p>
<h3>Little Change in Flour Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened, prices for various months fluctuated. With quotations for foreign wheat slightly declining by 0.10, 0.20, or 0.60 yuan, initial market sentiment was quite depressed. However, later, as gold prices soared, the market was inevitably affected, and buying interest in various contracts became slightly more active. As for factories and customers, large factories showed no activity, small factories made slight moves, and customer firms were mostly wrapping up, with little activity. The key to future trends will still depend on fluctuations in exchange rates. As a result, the current month remained unchanged, the second, third, fourth, and fifth months gained 0.0025 yuan, and the sixth month gained 0.0075 yuan.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market Generally Flat and Slightly Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market showed a trend of being generally flat and slightly firm. Factories preparing to receive goods in the current month have largely exhausted their demand. Based on the trend of the exchange, it seems that short positions are more reliable. However, considering the previous years' experiences, both sides are taking facts as the premise. Because distant months were only being sold by a certain grain firm, with more purchases than sales, the market reversed and showed strength. If the gold market undergoes further changes, it may become more active again. As a result, the current month was down 0.002 yuan from the previous day, February was up 0.003 yuan, March was up 0.002 yuan, and April, May, and June had no comparison.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: New Crop of Dutch Brown Sugar Begins to Be Sold</h3>
<p>Refined White Sugar Also See High Recovery</p>
<p>Yesterday, news from sugar-producing areas reported that the spot price of Cuban sugar remained unchanged. New York sugar futures for all months declined by 0.02 to 0.03 points. Spot and futures prices of Javanese sugar remained unchanged. The club market drew its lines. Initially, the price of Dutch 24-grade coarse white sugar was quite favorable due to the high exchange rate, with bids at 10.07 taels. However, there were no takers, and the buying price was lower, resulting in a stalemate. Later, some holders released goods, with the price dropping to 10.05 taels. Buying interest was still strong, and the market was quite firm, up 0.05 yuan compared to the previous day. Transactions in Japanese sugar were still frequent, with prices initially rising and then falling. N Mark was 10.07 taels, TM Mark was 10.025 taels, YT Mark was 10.0575 to 10.055 taels, YRO Mark was 10.0125 taels, YP Mark was 10.085 to 10.08 taels, Minghua goods were 10.0725 to 10.07 taels, and YT Mark was 10.0525 to 10.05 taels. Transactions on the stock exchange were even scarcer. New Qing sugar is becoming looser, and sales of the new crop of Dutch Brown sugar for June and July shipment have begun to be transacted, but the quantity is not large. This is because the quoted price is too high, resulting in weak buying interest. Jiecheng Foreign Firm sold 200 tons of 8-grade goods, priced at 5.47 Dutch guilders. The market is unremarkable.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Dried Lily Flowers' Rising Trend Continues</h3>
<p>Since the price of dried lily flowers has risen, demand from Guangdong and Hong Kong firms remains active. Therefore, the price continues to rise, and the trend is strong. Yesterday, Guangdong and Hong Kong firms made further purchases, with prices ranging from 28 to 26 taels. Secondary grades fluctuated by around 2 taels, up over 2 yuan from the previous market. Market sentiment is upward, and it is difficult to expect a turnaround in the short term. (Yesterday's report that Xiasheng's sun-dried longan pulp rose by 2 taels was incorrectly printed as 2,000 taels. This is corrected.)</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Shanghai Factories' Supply Can't Meet Demand</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there was little change in the local foreign firm silk market. This is because silk mills in Europe and the United States are all operating, and the demand for seasonal silk fabrics is increasing. Demand for Shanghai white factory silk from overseas remains strong, and telegrams remain favorable. However, manufacturers have underestimated the cost of raw materials, resulting in a shortage of supply. Yesterday, Qianli and others imported 50 bales of Shanghai white factory silk, and Kaili and others imported 30 bales of Sichuan yellow factory silk. Prices remain firm.</p>
<h3>Green Tea with Needle-Like Sprouts Shows Signs of Movement</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Tongfu, Jinlong, Tianxiang, and other firms resumed trading in green tea with needle-like sprouts. Transactions were not quiet, but the market price was 4-5 taels lower than before. Although there were sporadic transactions in Precious Sprouts and Pearl Tea, selling prices have fallen to the extreme, and market sentiment remains pessimistic. Gongxi Green Tea, Russian firms have announced a suspension of trading. There is no certainty in the sales of Whitehead Tea.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Rhapsody</h3>
<p>(1) Su Ling</p>
<p>"The End"</p>
<p>After "The End" was projected on the screen, the whole theater changed from darkness to light. Men and women stood up from their seats, their minds vaguely recalling the events of the past hour. Reluctantly leaving their seats, they inevitably headed towards the exit.</p>
<p>The air outside was naturally much fresher than inside the theater. Ke Ming tilted his felt hat and decided to walk to the tram station. Suddenly, he heard a familiar voice calling out from behind.</p>
<p>"Ke Ming, Ke Ming!"</p>
<p>"Oh, Chao Sheng, it's been a long time," Ke Ming replied.</p>
<p>"Yes, why haven't I seen you in so long?"</p>
<p>"I just returned to Shanghai two days ago. I took a long trip," Ke Ming said.</p>
<p>"That's great! Were you two together? Why didn't I know you and Miss Bi got married?" Chao Sheng asked.</p>
<p>"What? You're completely wrong. I traveled alone. But why don't you know that my love with Bi has long reached 'The End'?" Ke Ming replied.</p>
<p>"Oh, so your long trip was a sorrowful escape after breaking up with her," Chao Sheng said.</p>
<p>"Not entirely. Love is like a series of plays. When one play reaches 'The End,' one can only switch to another partner in some way. For example, when this movie is over, the next one has to have a new group of viewers. So, like us, we have to wait for a new movie to come out before we watch it," Ke Ming explained.</p>
<p>"So you're back in Shanghai and looking for a new partner?" Chao Sheng asked.</p>
<p>"Not yet. But Chao Sheng, what about you?" Ke Ming inquired.</p>
<p>"Me? I never see 'The End.' You know my past. I don't have an old [partner], and I don't have a lover. To be honest, when I start with a woman, that's when it ends. This may sound mysterious, but it's really just that there's no beginning and no 'The End.' If I suddenly end up with this woman, then suddenly end up with that woman, maybe I'll end up with this one again, but I don't know. So, I don't know if there's a beginning and if there's 'The End,'" Chao Sheng replied.</p>
<p>As they talked, they unknowingly walked to the middle of Nanjing Road.</p>
<p>"Let's meet again when we have the chance. I'll walk over there. I don't know if you're taking the tram," Ke Ming said.</p>
<p>"Okay, goodbye," Chao Sheng replied. Ke Ming got on a tram and saw Chao Sheng walking down a side street, illuminated by the red light of a traffic light.</p>
<p>Ke Ming struggled in a jumble of memories.</p>
<h3>White Goose Painting Research Institute to Hold Exhibition</h3>
