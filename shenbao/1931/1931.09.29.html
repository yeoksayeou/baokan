<p>異哉日人所謂满洲自主獨立運動。前日路透社載東京電。謂華人代表團袁金鎧等商諸關東軍司令本莊。請扶助推倒張學良。俾建設满洲獨立政府今日軍通社電。又謂满洲自治主義之新政權運動。已有進步。袁金鎧等九人組織地方維持委員會。擬將東北全部行政權。握於其手另傳一消息。更爲具體謂满洲之獨立運動。已制定憲法。準備由满洲民族形成一獨立國家。分下列數項。一遼吉黑熱四省及内外蒙。離開中央獨立。二以獨立青年黨爲運動之主體。三由野心家及舊軍閥策動。又有復辟派參加。立於表面運動者。有張作相張宗昌及溥儀之一派等。日人揑造此種種離奇怪誕之消息。其處心積慮。不外欲達其久佔满洲之目的。欲效法蘇俄併吞外蒙之手叚。以亡我東三省。其陰謀不過如是而已。</p>
<p>蓋日本之視東三省。爲其囊中物者已久。十餘年來。蓄意經營。近日突然以如如火荼之暴軍。强佔遼吉各地。固未嘗不欲直截爽快。一氣吞下。然觀國際間之形勢。有所不能。强佔各地之兵。旣不能不撤。則即不能達其明目張膽實行久佔之目的。於是乃另易　間接過渡之方法。前已滅亡朝鮮。旣已用此方法今又何嘗不可。且其所以亟亟焉製造此種新聞者。尚含有兩種用意。一方用以威嚇張學良。使之早日就範。早日俯首忍受其要求。一方則用以試探各國之意見。照一九二二年華盛頓所訂九國協定。（日亦簽字國之一）各締約國應尊重中國之主權與獨立。暨領土與行政之完整。日本自不能擁某一派人獨立。以破壞中國領土與行政之完整。故先放此空氣。以試探與約各國之有無異言。亦爲意中之事。日人之詭譎狡謀。本無所不至。今之傳布此說。不過益露其蓄謀併吞東省之野心耳。嗚呼。寗能以一手掩盡天下目耶。</p>

<p>使用國際所禁毒彈</p>
<p>天津通信、日軍在關外所演慘劇、愈演愈烈、自前日（二十四日）開始用飛機追擊列車以來、昨日較前日所演者更甚前日不過追擊由瀋西來列車、昨日則連東上列車一併截擊、且將行動範圍擴充至大虎山以西、窺其用意、似欲阻斷平瀋交通、以圖掩蓋遼吉間一切眞相、昨日上午十一時、有山海關開往瀋陽之一百零五次大通車、在饒陽河西即被飛機追逐、追至饒陽河車站西揚旗外、即由機上擲下炸彈一顆幸未擊中、列車遂在站不停、開足速力前進、將達東揚旗外、日機又擲下炸彈一顆、亦未中、墜於棉花地内、該日飛機見兩彈未中、又追上列車、發機關槍一排、車上亦未有死傷、昨日下午由瀋開平之第四次客車、行經溝帮子東一站之趙家屯、忽來土匪若干、在軌道兩旁向列車開槍轟擊、該車亦加足速力前進、雖未被土匪刦去財物、車上旅客被擊傷七名、有無死亡、尚未探悉、該匪行動之敏捷、亦與前日搶刦一零四次車相髣髴、同日下午三時許、由山海關東開之第一零三次客車、行經巨流河車站、該站已被日軍佔據、站上駐有大批日軍將該車截住、並將所有旅客、逐一檢查、行李等件全被搜檢、有無損失尚未調查、押車路警之槍械全被繳去、有一警略露不願之意、即被日軍綁架而去、生死未明、現北寗路局對關外段列車、决定仍抱犧牲精神、將各次客車照舊行駛、</p>
<p>前日在興隆店被日軍飛機用機關槍掃射之一零二次大通車、於昨日下午四時開抵天津、記者特登車視察、當時受傷之旅客三名、一名在唐山已下車、二名隨車來津、當由北寗路醫院派醫生將其接下、遂往馬大夫醫院代爲醫治、一名焦嘉惠、係東北航空處機械班班長、在皇姑屯登車時、因車上已無揷足之地、乃爬登車頂、被日軍飛機打傷右手、食指碎裂、一名張樂文、係來天津找第二軍軍部胡副官、立在車門之外、被日飛機擊中左腕、皮膚開裂據談當時情况、謂日軍飛機三架、機身均係灰色、原爲吾國所有、被日軍取去者、自該車由皇姑屯開駛時、即跟車前日軍飛機在北寗路興隆店站東轟擊客車左圖係車廂鋼皮被日飛機用國機公約禁止使用之達姆彈射中之彈孔</p>
<p>進、内有一零九號飛機、於事達興隆店車站前、陡然下降、距車頂不過數尺、機上日人已可明瞭望見、列車知該機將預備被日軍飛機擊斃之北寗車旅客遼寗財政廳書記李豐年（被達姆彈射中股間將肉炸去彈由小股穿出）</p>
<p>射擊、乃開足速力前進、該機共繞車三匝、似均未得到瞄準機會、最後乃順列車行進方向飛去、至若干距離後、復行飛回、用機關槍向列車迎頭射擊、車頂上當時擠满乘客、於飛機盤旋時、即紛紛預備擠入車内、紛擾之時、有由車頂滾落地下者、當時車内外人聲鼎沸、婦孺哭嚎之聲、尤慘不忍聞、飛機旣開槍、因係由前面迎射而來、故將掛在列車中段之二零五號三等車前半部之旅客擊斃二名、擊傷三名、死者二人均係立在車門之外、其北寗路火車满載由瀋陽逃難到天津之難民</p>
<p>一著新藍布大褂、舉動頗似一化裝出走之軍政人物、其頭部被所中子彈開花炸裂、左右之人身上均濺有血跡、登時倒地而亡、其姓名則無從查悉、屍首已在興隆店車站移下、其一携有妻子老母、被日飛機擊中胸部、子彈亦在胸内炸裂、且似非祗中一彈、故腹破腸出、登時斃命、其妻母覩狀、痛不欲生、哭暈數次、於軍抵青堆子時、由其妻母將屍移下、詢其母知爲李姓、同時並有一婦人懷抱一子、坐於車門外脚踏板上、其子被日機擊中、即時躍下、墜於車底、該婦人亦隨其子躍下、是否其身亦被日機擊中、則不可知、但有人窺見、似已墜落軌道之上、被列車輾過、同時尚有立於車外之人、因驚慌失措、而墜車者若干、該車開行速度極高、墜下之人不死亦傷、其數目則無法考查矣、檢查死者所中之彈、於擊中後均自行炸裂、車上所留彈孔、亦有寸餘、故足證明確爲達姆彈之一類、此彈在歐戰以前即經國際協約禁止使用、因其中人之後、受傷過鉅、極難保持生命、有傷人道主義、戰爭目的在挫折敵人戰鬥力、不在殺傷多寡、故國際公約規定對已失戰鬥力及非戰鬥員不准加以傷害、今日飛機乃用國際不許之毒彈、無故射擊非戰鬥員、且爲避難之人民、此與嗜殺成性之蠻族無以異、尚得靦然列於國際之林耶、（二十六日）</p>

<p>日軍於十八晩十時後、分頭出動、約有五百人往攻迫擊砲廠、入門即横掃機關槍、致衞兵工人約死三十餘人、門窗被損壞不少、日軍進内、將一切軍火携走甚多、機器上重要零件、亦悉卸下携去、</p>

<p>廢歷八月十八日大汛時期已屆、潮水漲落、關係頗巨、緣因各省慘遭水災、吳淞口塘工潰决、雖經市公務局等各機關竭力搶修、恐潮水高大、湧上岸塘、此非人力所能制止者、日來潮水最高尺度、想爲社會人士所極關注意之事、茲錄如下、此次自舊歷十三晩潮起汛、潮水漲至三十八尺、十四日潮及夜潮、均不相上下、因該兩日係東北風、至晩間轉成西北風、十五日則風轉東南、故潮水略減、十六則西北風起、晩潮漲至三十七尺三吋即退、昨日日潮、在三十六尺九吋之間、晩潮大約有减無漲、今日倘無猛烈之東北風發現、則决無巨潮、照此看來、本埠本年之大汛、諒可無虞矣、</p>

<p>暴日蠶食瀋陽。其野心固不止東北而已。田中義一有言曰。欲征服支那。必先征服满蒙。使世界知東亞爲彼之東亞。永不敢向其侵略。是則蹂躪瀋陽。即并吞我中華之導火綫耳。本市市民大會舉會之日。適晤由瀋避難來滬某君。聆其涕泣之詞如后。</p>
<p>某君虎口餘生。直至行抵天津。周身血液。始稍覺舒暢。而錯亂之神經。固猶驚恐無定也。日軍於大隊入城之際。遇華人。即示生吞活剥之狰獰凶態。酒臭薰天。見者奔避不遑。無辜孩提。父母抱携不及。日兵輒用右手緊握孩踵。奮力分屍爲二。或以剌刀解體爲四。凶狠殘酷。舉世罕聞。</p>
<p>莊丁登車脱險。苟爲日兵瞥見。則拖曳而下。先施以鞭撻。繼持利刃剖斷之。車站積屍遍地。示衆三日。則以蔴袋載運離瀋。以圖絶跡。而日本佔據瀋陽之軍事當局。猶口口聲聲。禁止華人越東省一步。儘可安居樂業。一面乃唆使其殖民地亡鮮流民。謂汝等本满洲産侵汝土地。殺汝祖宗者。支那人。汝等今欲雪恥。此其時矣。而不辨恩怨之朝鮮亡國奴。竟墮其術中。成羣結隊。呼嘯於城市要衝。大展奸淫擄掠之厥技。據愚所稔。瀋陽留滬之學生。彼輩固久不接故鄉音問。亦無敢作歸里之想者。涕泗語人。我儕國雖未盡破。而家即先亡。誠非牽衣惜别時所可逆料者。</p>

<p>日本雖和我是同種的國家。他們的心理。倒和我國人完全不同。我國人很像破落戶的子弟。狂嫖濫賭。只曉得满足個人的慾望。一味的冥頑不靈。來受地棍惡痞的剥削。吮其血而鹽其腦。還自以爲可度其安閑的日子·日本人很像地棍惡痞。刁鑽古怪。唯利是圖。現在瞧見那破落戶的子弟有些覺悟。有此作爲。一不做二不休。便翻下了面孔。拔出拳頭打過來了。唉。不是我們平日自暴自棄。那裏有這個吃苦頭的日子到來呢。俗語說「矮子多肚腸。」這可說是日本人正確的心理測騐。你瞧日本男子。唇上留了一撮小鬍鬚。目光鋭利。不是一副陰險的面孔麽。他們做生意的時候。非常謙和。委實和上海的店肆夥計。大不相同。你說他有禮貌。實則矮子心裏。自有城府。要騙中國人的金錢罷了。可憐中國人貪小便宜。一切日用物品。已經是日本人的經濟世界了。這次日本侵略東省。窮兇極惡。我勸中國人不要再貪小便宜。快快改用國貨。萬衆一心。制他死命。這個主見。人人鐫在心裏。不在於口頭宣傳。佛言「一切心造」確有至理。不信且看甘地。古人說。「楚雖三戶。亡秦必楚。」這個「心」字。力量很大。我願國人個個有心便好了。日本雖强。必有一日。我雖没功夫做大文章。在自由談裏不妨談談罷。日本的女子。雖然對貞操問題。不當什麽一回事。可是愛國的心。不讓男子。有某婦拿梨與荔枝給伊的兒子喫。兒子吃得非常快樂。那婦人道。這梨是中國天津産的。這荔枝是中國廣東産的。你們喜歡梨和荔子。便可想到中國的天津和廣東了。中國是個好地方。中國人是個自暴自棄的人類。你們將來大可給國家立些功烈呀。唉。日本人的心理怎樣。日本的幼穉敎育怎樣。我們不是要不寒而慄麽。日本人也很喜歡賭博。所以上</p>

<p>— 定明</p>
<p>首都市民於九月二十三日上午九時。在公共體育塲開反日救國大會。余於七時許即持「打倒日本」三角形紙旗。徒步前往參加。至復成橋前數十武處。邂逅一律右手執旗。身着白衣黑裙赤腿黄鞋之女生一隊。併步趕至隊前。視其所執之大布旗。始知爲國民革命軍遺族女子學校。二人一排。悲憤之氣。呈於顔面。余細瞻各持之旗。大率書「打倒日本帝國主義。」敎員之旗書「勿再五分鐘。」「寗爲玉碎。勿爲瓦全。」「急起救國。捨身赴難。一男敎員則持「有日無我。有我無日。」旗。而一年長女生。體格健全。態度悲壯。手執「殺到東京去。痛飲倭奴血。」其志向之偉大。爱國心之熱烈。表現無餘。黨國先烈之後裔遺族。畢竟不凡。至監察院門前。此女生隊突然停止。旋見領隊者予各人以黑紗。一轉瞬齊纏臂上。繼續進行。入公共體育塲去。塲前立童子軍一隊。軍警散佈四周。秩序井然。門内兩旁置長桌二列。桌上紛置簽到簿。簿分黨學農工商軍政市民及市民團體各部。簽名索傳單入而縱觀。則會塲在北。主席台遍懸黨國旗。南與指揮台之無數小旗相聨貫。</p>
<p>時尚早。參加之羣衆。絡繹於門。喇叭聲。號呌聲。斷續於耳。全塲遍佈童子軍。主席台後即第一公園。數十株垂楊。絲絲倒掛。似亦作垂頭喪氣狀。已而開會。舉踵環視。則碩大無垠之體育塲。已人山人海。僅見數百千之旗幟。飄拂風中而已。</p>
<p>老主席氣急報告　如儀開會後。大會主席團公推周伯敏爲主席。報告開會理由。并朗讀提案。但累因咳嗽中輟。或曰此老恨倭人生氣。故發咳耳。後市民中有一人高聲提議。請另易一人讀之。主席不顧。須臾又一人請。始許之。此翁老而益壯。足爲後生矜式。</p>
<p>唐國楨聲涙俱下　演說時。有婦女救濟會代表唐國楨女士者。態度自然。發言清晰。詞尤慷慨激昻。有云「願政府對日宣戰。望大衆爲刀下鬼。勿爲亡國奴。」伊則願以碧血殉主義。言至目下國内人民顚沛流離。日本乘機肆虐。及已往慘案。忍痛嗚咽。且哭且說。最後云「願在塲女性。發起組織女子反日救國敢死隊。實地參加作戰。不讓男子之後。」云云。說畢。仍頻頻以巾拭涙不止</p>
<p>華僑同志傷心　華僑代表鄭螺生。一年邁老翁也。演說至傷心處。將馬來土語帶出。令人不解。但無不默許其爲熱衷愛國者。</p>
<p>東北代表哀號　次爲東北旅京同鄉會代表馮兆異演說。先以簡單之語報告東北此次遭慘現狀。終乃大聲哀號曰。「東北亡了。東北亡了。」而退。愚按凡人有涙無聲謂之泣。有涙有聲謂之哭。有聲無涙謂之號。號乃傷心至極之表示。此君蓋傷心極矣。</p>
<p>小弟弟要打倒日本　提案通過後。即由指揮股指揮整隊游行。至大中橋。逢約六七歲之男女小學生二。女生手中已高執三四旗。男生突至余前索旗。余出隊詢其故。并問旗上何字。男生伸手取旗。且指旗上字曰。「要……打倒日本」。嘻。反日空氣。已深印小弟弟之腦筋矣。</p>
<p>于院長代中央致辭　嗣經淮清橋·姚家巷·夫子廟·四象橋·太平路·楊公井·二郎廟·碑亭巷。轉至國府路。一路標語满眼。國旗紛飛。惟均下半旗耳。沿途四人一列。秩序整齊至國民政府請願時。首在國府前全體高唱黨歌。次由主席團代表全體入内請願對日宣戰。由于右任院長代中央出見。于院長挺立國府門前木凳上致辭。有云「今日人民所請願於政府者。政府當盡力之所至。共同救國。此即本人代表政府之意。亦即所以答復各同胞者。望此次共同挽救國難的奮鬭。英勇堅决地達到成功。」</p>
<p>於是羣衆於高呼口號聲中。出至中山路散隊而歸。歸而泚筆記之。用告國人。</p>
<p>海跑狗塲裏。常有他們的足跡。日人所辦的本埠某學校。裏面旦可以公開打馬將。不過是消遣性質。並不是拿金錢來作輸贏的。和我國人的心理。又大不相同啊。</p>

<p>「那麽我挽留你，你也走？」陳先生眞是情不自禁，把心裏要說的話，坦白地說出來了。</p>
<p>「……但是現在的環境，要我走，我是非走不可的了；我們也許有再見的日子，今夜你夫人不知什麽時候回來，要是不能遇見伊，請你給我傳句話，說我不能和伊握别了」。李夫人起初默然地半嚮，後來便悽然地這麽說，伊把自已的頭漸漸地沉到懷裏去，聲音是哽咽着，陳先生也睢不起伊是不是在哭泣。</p>
<p>「外面的謡言，總是謡言，我們自問良心，有什麽對不起人的地方，作何必這樣生氣？我想你的生活是狠苦，你决不能辭職，還是由我辭職離開了上海吧。我本來有個朋友在天津銀行當總經理，他去的時候，我　塊兒走的，我老實告訴你，就因爲捨不得離開這上海，才没有去。假使現在我去找他，一定可以找到一個相當的事情，你千萬不要走，讓我走吧！」</p>
<p>「我不過是個女人，名譽和地位，都没有關係；你是一個男子，並且還年青，兒女却已成行·你的負担是多麽重，萬一受了這謡言的影響，我怎麽對得起你；咳！總而言之，我們遇見的機會是太遲了，别的都是廢話」</p>
<p>「你到杭州的話，李先生是怎樣意見？」</p>
<p>「他麽？他對我一無表示，好似我們兩人是一無關係的樣子。你給我想着吧，這樣的家庭，還有什麽意味？假使換一個意志稍爲薄弱一些的人，是早已自殺的了。前天晩上，他回家的時候，他公然把一筆木器公司的賬，在那裏算，我問他；買這些重價的木器，要來何用？他回說；不用管；我又問他把我如何處置？他又說；你得放心，我决不和你離婚，你得安靜地吃你的飯，你要像陳先生那麽的性格，我便疼愛你了。你想他的話，可惡不可惡；我眞没法把他怎樣。我假使提出離婚，外面一定會把謡言聨想起來，使你受到不白之寃；幸而現在你夫人不常出去，和你是狠好，伊總可以不再疑心到我們有什麽　昧，否則我也無從向伊辯訴了。在從前我還懇求你給我探聽汽車裏的女人，現在我也死了這心，因爲聽着你的話，我眞知道了一切，不但無法抵制他，反增加自己的煩惱，如今他大買木器，還不是和那個女人租了房子麽？」</p>

<p>這一號的内容是更比以前的充實了、像隨着日子的推移這週刊是一步步的進化着、一步步的走上完善的光明的道路的、本號是「世界女作家特輯號」、那更是引起文藝界的注意、爲的誰也會感到興趣去知道一些最近世界女作家的身世和作品的、</p>
<p>我現在把該號裏的内容介紹如左、第一篇是我們的翻譯界名流趙景深先生的「冰心女士的「南歸」」、我們讀過趙先生的這一類的文字的人一定知道趙先生的筆鋒是輕快而婉轉的、這一篇「南歸」的讀後感的文字更是輕淡而抒情化的、同時含有詩的趣味的、</p>
<p>趙先生的該文中的—</p>
<p>「南歸只是兩萬多字的一個中篇、但這却是冰心女士最長的作品、與其說是小說、還不如說是回想錄更來得尊重作者一些、她不是拿幻想的事實來娱樂我們、而是拿她的一顆眞誠的女兒的心熱烈的托出來獻給我們、她一方面是在苦痛的追憶她那死去的母親、一方面却是要一些同情於她的或與她遭遇相同的人互通聖魂上的交感、這是至情至性的文字、雖然全篇所寫的只是她的母親　死的記錄、她的母親病前的徵象、」</p>
<p>這一段寫得何等使人感動、同時、趙先生以回想錄來批評「南歸」、更是有識、其次、楊昌溪的法國當代女作家高麗黛的介紹文字、是很有趣味的文字、凡讀過高女士的「紫戀」的人是更需要知道她的藝術化的身世的　如何去當舞女、如何的大膽描冩婦女的實際生活、如何去嫁給那貴族的音樂天才的象徵詩人的來歴的、</p>
<p>毛一波的「印度女詩人奈都」一篇也是很精巧的文字、女詩人奈都的抒情詩已是引起各方面的作家注意了、她的民族運動更是引起全世界人士的贊賞而敬佩、我們讀了毛先生這篇文字以後、更可知道奈都女士的身世、而爲文藝界的興奮的談助、</p>
<p>倪貽德的「現代女畫家」是一篇介紹羅朗商夫人的身世、和作品的文字、羅朗商是現代風的女性的典型、是現代人藝術的典型、她是野獃派的畫家、我們讀了倪先生的這篇文字、便可知道羅朗商的作風一切了、</p>
<p>崔萬秋先生生的「林芙美子訪問記」一篇是很有趣味的訪問記、林芙美子是日本文壇上出色的新進女作家、她的作品已有一部分由崔先生譯成中文了、我們讀了這篇崔先生的很幽默的文字之後、更可知道林女士是怎樣的浪漫而活潑的年青女子、</p>
<p>此外有羅朗商的「彈提琴的少女」的插圖、還有已逝世的普羅作家蔣光茲夫人吳似鴻女士之近訊、在民族主義的文學勃興的時期裏、看一看普羅没落的人物的行動、更是有趣味的了、</p>
<p>最後、很值得報告讀者的是星期文藝編者湯增敭先生已請定許多國内外名作家特約撰稿、詩歌方面、請黄霍遐先生邵冠華先生等担任、介紹方面、請楊昌溪先生等担任、同時倪貽德毛一波崔萬秋徐蘇靈諸先生也願担任些稿件、由此看來、星期文藝的確是有「蒸蒸日上」之勢的、</p>

<p>（一）</p>
<p>起來呀、同胞們、猛醒起來、</p>
<p>日本帝國主義的槍頭、砲口、</p>
<p>已在瞄準我們全國的腦袋、</p>
<p>還要做夢嗎、還要醉眠朦朧、</p>
<p>我們的東北便將成他人的满蒙、</p>
<p>瀋陽城頭、太陽旗兒隨風飄動、</p>
<p>瀋陽城裏、狂燒着烟火蓬蓬、</p>
<p>我們的財産、我們的屋宇、我們的一切</p>
<p>都化成了殘灰、青烟、散入空空、</p>
<p>看呀、日帝國主義的長槍、利刃、</p>
<p>射擊着、屠殺着我們無辜的民衆、</p>
<p>看呀、日帝國主義的大砲、炸彈、</p>
<p>把我們的東北打得片土不完、</p>
<p>同胞的熱血满塗着遼東三士、</p>
<p>同胞的屍骨遍舖了錦纑江山、</p>
<p>聽呀、砲聲、殺聲撼動着宇宙、</p>
<p>哭聲、泣聲響徹了雲空、</p>
<p>聽呀、北寗路邊正吹着戰號衝鋒、</p>
<p>太平洋正喧着戰鼓鼕鼕、</p>
<p>世界滾進了滔滔混混、</p>
<p>日月蒙住了慘慘昏昏、</p>
<p>同胞們明敏的同胞們、</p>
<p>還要做夢嗎、還要醉眼朦朧、</p>
<p>起來喲、同胞們、猛醒起來、</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>起來喲、同胞們、覺悟起來、</p>
<p>日本帝國主義的陰謀毒計、</p>
<p>正如電網一般的設施佈擺、</p>
<p>還要漠然嗎、還要置若不聞不見、</p>
<p>我們舉國便將墜入茫茫的陷阱、</p>
<p>不要希望國際的公道、</p>
<p>不要希望世界的同情、</p>
<p>如今、公道是握在强權的手裏、</p>
<p>同情不種在人類的心田、</p>
<p>不要相信凱洛格的非戰公約、</p>
<p>不要枉想國際聨盟的調停、</p>
<p>如今、公約徒是紙上的虚文、</p>
<p>調停徒是緩和我民氣的美名、</p>
<p>强國侵略弱國、</p>
<p>衆民殘殺寡民、</p>
<p>强權就是公理、</p>
<p>公理也是强權、</p>

<p>還有什麽公道、</p>
<p>還有什麽同情、</p>
<p>更還顧什麽公約、</p>
<p>更還容什麽調停、</p>
<p>——弱者滅亡、强者生存、——</p>
<p>我們不要索性的鎭靜、鎭靜、</p>
<p>我們不要索性的無抵抗、無抵抗、</p>
<p>不聽見嗎、人家的話兒、</p>
<p>三十六小時、要把中國滅亡、</p>
<p>今天、到了明天晩上、</p>
<p>唉、我們便要做了亡國的羔羊、</p>
<p>同胞們呀、對着慘黯的前途、</p>
<p>你們的心靈可感到何等的痛創、</p>
<p>到了手銬·脚鐐·枷在肩上、</p>
<p>是的、那時候、我們祗有鎭靜、鎭靜、</p>
<p>那時候、我們祗有無抵抗、無抵抗、</p>
<p>濟案的血痕、鮮案的痛創、</p>
<p>豈已從我們的腦海、心頭一齊消亡、</p>
<p>同胞們、勇敢的同胞們、</p>
<p>還能鎭靜嗎、還能無抵抗、</p>
<p>起來喲、同胞們、覺悟起來、</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>起來呀、同胞們、振作起來、</p>
<p>日本帝國主義正礪刀砥劍、</p>
<p>準備着向我們大舉殺害、</p>
<p>還容等候嗎、還容躊躇、</p>
<p>我們的面前只横着一條死路、</p>
<p>我們有廣大遼闊的疆土、</p>
<p>爲什麽要供人家瓜分割據、</p>
<p>我們有四萬萬多的同胞、</p>
<p>爲什麽要供人家任意宰屠、</p>
<p>我們有沸騰的熱血、</p>
<p>要渲紅汚濁的太平洋、</p>
<p>我們有活躍的熱力、</p>
<p>要顚覆蕞爾的扶桑、</p>
<p>我們有勇毅的精神、</p>
<p>要叱咤宇宙的日月風雲、</p>
<p>我們有蓬勃的豪氣、</p>
<p>要吞吐世界的海陸空、</p>
<p>但是呀、現在我們正遍地哀鴻、</p>
<p>跳梁的倭奴又乘機集我遼東、</p>
<p>長春去了、瀋陽去了、吉林也去了……</p>
<p>數萬里的土地已入了他人的懷中、</p>
<p>財産失了、廬舍失了、性命也失了……</p>
<p>冷月秋星正弔着哀哀的孤魂、</p>
<p>現在、我們的面前只横着一條死路、</p>
<p>還容等候嗎、還容躊躇、</p>
<p>來吧、來吧、剛毅的同胞們、</p>
<p>滾起我們的熱血、燒起我們的熱力、</p>
<p>吐出我們的豪氣、振起我們的精神、</p>
<p>拼命呀、和這東亞的妖魔拼個死命、</p>
<p>伸出我們的拳頭、</p>
<p>打死這無恥的跳梁小丑、</p>
<p>放準我們的砲口、</p>
<p>對着蕞爾的扶桑三洲、</p>
<p>這是我國家民族生死存亡的時候、</p>
<p>這是我國家民族一髮千鈞的時候、</p>
<p>同胞們、剛毅的同胞們、</p>
<p>還容等候嗎、還容躊躇、</p>
<p>起來喲、同胞們、振作起來、</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>起來呀、同胞們、武裝起來、</p>
<p>日本帝國主義的鋭槍利刃、</p>
<p>已將加在我們的肩頭項背、</p>
<p>還容害怕嗎、還容退讓、</p>
<p>唯一的對付只有武裝抵抗、</p>
<p>「寗爲戰死鬼、不作亡國奴、」</p>
<p>縱使血流曠野、屍爛寒江、</p>
<p>也强如眼看着妻離子散、國破家亡、</p>
<p>不要退讓、不要害怕、</p>
<p>我們要以齒還齒、以牙還牙、</p>
<p>不要害怕、不要退讓、</p>
<p>我們四萬萬的屍體要塡塞太平洋、</p>
<p>我們四萬萬的頭顱要壓扁扶桑、</p>
<p>抛了斧頭、鐮刀與筆桿、</p>
<p>拏起雪亮的利刃、明晃的長槍、</p>
<p>出了學校、田隴與工廠、</p>
<p>跑上黄沙滾滾、殺氣騰騰的戰塲、</p>
<p>同心合力、勇往直前的跑向敵方、</p>
<p>殺呀、呌呀、拼命呀、奮鬥呀、</p>
<p>爲着國家民族的生死存亡、</p>
<p>行看那燦爛的、勝利的太陽、</p>
<p>終會照在我們的頭上、</p>
<p>同胞們、偉大的同胞們、</p>
<p>還容害怕嗎、還容退讓、</p>
<p>起來喲、同胞們、武裝起來、</p>
<p>全國一致起來抵抗、</p>
<p>亭子間裏的悒鬱文華</p>
<p>是昨天早晨、我正躺在棉軟的床上、吟味着幾首情意纏綿的古詞、忽然有人在門上得得地擊了幾下、</p>
<p>「快點、不得了、報告你一個大不幸的消息、」這彷彿是灿的聲音、</p>
<p>大不幸的消息、是什麽一回事呀、怕不要是來兜什麽滑稽的玩兒、這樣想時、灿已推門而入了、祇見他面門上的肉痙痙着、揑着一大捲的報紙的手顫抖着、表情是這樣的緊張、充满了憤懑、悒鬱、難言的苦痛、</p>
<p>「什麽事呀、值得這樣大驚小怪、」我急速從床上爬起來、把一本詞選往旁邊一丢、知道事情有些不妙、</p>
<p>「不得了、不得了、日本兵佔據東三省了、什麽安東、瀋陽……都已被佔領、兵工廠被毁、人民被慘殺、軍隊被解除武……」他終於吃住口了、眼淚熱烘烘地從他的眼眶裏滾下來了、</p>
<p>「眞的麽、怎麽事先一點都不知道呢、在那裏、讓我看、」</p>
<p>「你去看吧、」他將手中的兩張報往床上一擲、</p>
<p>一斜條的紅字、即刻映入我的眼簾裏、</p>
<p>日本兵——殺吾同胞繳吾槍械佔吾地千里、毁吾兵工廠參謀長榮臻全家被擄旅長團長被殺、</p>
<p>眞好像一個晴天霹靂、使人的神經振盪了、使我的血管鼓漲了、我幾乎暈倒過去、我忍着痛、逐字看下去、是不忍卒讀的一個個血字哪、這是我的祖國的恥辱、四千文化的中華、一旦竟罹此奇恥大辱、無辜受異族的侵凌、殘酷的日賊啊………</p>
<p>我終於看不下去了、我的神經已經麻木了、</p>
<p>「爲什麽日人竟這樣兇殘呢、」我像吐氣一般說、</p>
<p>「最可惡的是乘我們水災的時分來侵襲我們、這簡直是獸類的行爲哪」、灿的面也漲紅了、他底胸頭迅速地起伏着、我們都被憤懑的情緒鼓動着了、這狹窄的亭子間中、充满了悒鬱的氣氛、像要爆裂一般地緊張、在這一殺那、全中國的同胞凡是有血氣的、恐怕都像我們一樣義憤塡膺吧、</p>
<p>「可憐自己中國人還朝夕相侵、一點也不合作、以致落得這般田地、眼見得祇有坐以待斃了……」我說、</p>
<p>「是啦、要是此刻没有兩粤的反叛、合國的軍隊都一致對外、恐怕還能和日本抵抗一下呢、」</p>
<p>我們又沉默了片刻、各人面面相覻、都是一張憤慨的面孔、在我們的心頭、像壓着一坑冷重的石頭一般、</p>
<p>「我想、與其這麽挨受恥辱、無寗和他媽的開戰一下、死就死了、亡就亡了、在民族史上總尚存着光榮的一頁、」</p>
<p>「是啦、打他媽的一下子、亡總不見得的、至多也不過是失地喪兵、但那也是值得的咧、」</p>
<p>「這一次要是中國人再没有嚴重的表示、往後國家的命運怕比雅片戰爭的浩刦以後都還不知呢、」</p>
<p>「是的、我們要告訴他中國人是不易欺的、我們尚有熱烈的血、」</p>
<p>「啊、我們要當兵去纔好呢、跑到血腥的邊域、殺得他媽的猪狗血肉横飛、片甲不留啊、」灿的情感是興奮極了、他高昻的嗓子震動了全厔、他揑緊着的拳頭、望桌子上痛擊了一下、就躺倒在床上了、</p>
<p>「當兵去、直殺到扶桑三島、殺盡敵人、」</p>
<p>超頂點的氣憤和悒鬱裹住了我俩的周身、我們都沉默下來了、</p>
<p>「可是呀、那裏有容許我們去和敵人厮殺的機會呢、要是執政者們不抛棄他們私人的利害、替中國抗爭、那是什麽辦法都没有了、」</p>
<p>「不是得吧、先要我們人民覺醒起來、一致對外、執政者來運用這力量纔好呢、」</p>
<p>「啊、難道中國人是永不會覺醒的麽」</p>
<p>、中國人就活該做奴隸的麽、天哪、那些冷血的青年們、怕還在頽廢的亭子間裏呻吟、在紅燈綠酒之間享樂咧、他們的腦中、難道是没有祖國的印象的麽……」</p>
<p>「我們有血氣的青年是應該結合起來、挽此祖國的危機、救起四萬萬將做亡國奴的同胞、」</p>
<p>「當兵去吧、祖國將亡了、」</p>
<p>我們的興奮的話是有盡的、但我們奔放的熱情、汹湧的血潮是永無止期的呀、</p>
<p>兩個祖國的孩子這樣悒鬱在亭子間裏、</p>

<p>(Harbin) A unit of the Second Division of the Japanese Army Opened Up the Tao'ang Road and Forcibly Occupied the Road. The Fifth Unit of the Japanese Army Will Open Up Jilin Today. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Received Telegrams from Beiping That the Japanese Army's Brutal Acts of Trampling on the Northeast Have Not Ended. The Most Recent Situation is as Follows: (1) According to a Report from the Tao'ang Railway Bureau, on the 25th, two Japanese aircraft Dropped two sulfur bombs near the South Barracks in Taonan. Then, at 10:00 AM, two trains of Japanese soldiers arrived, stopping at the South Station in Taonan, carrying about two to three hundred Japanese soldiers, with several machine guns and three cannons, claiming to be a reclamation army. Upon hearing that the reclamation army had also been transferred far away, they immediately claimed to return to their country the next day. Also, a Japanese advisor from the Tao'ang Road accompanied the troop train to Tao, requesting an official letter from the bureau to entrust him with handling the bureau's affairs. However, the Japanese person immediately entered the city and did not return. (2) According to a Report from the Tongliao County Magistrate, on the 22nd, several Japanese armored trains came from the Zheng-Tong Line, advancing towards the county. They even fired a shot at Ouli. They came again the next day, using several vehicles with guns and cannons, firing four shots at the city. On the morning of the 24th, Japanese aircraft also came and dropped several bombs, causing damage and injuries. (3) The Japanese troops invading Liaoyuan have increased to a thousand people, and the situation is becoming more urgent. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Japanese Aircraft Shoot at the Beining Railway Train <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Endangering the Safety of Chinese and Foreign Passengers</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Municipal Government, based on a letter from the Beining Railway Bureau, stated that Japanese aircraft have been chasing passenger trains for days, endangering the safety of Chinese and foreign passengers. On the 27th, in addition to informing the consuls of various countries, requesting them to negotiate with Japan to stop the brutal acts of the Japanese army, Section Chief Shen Dijia was also sent to protest to the Japanese consul, but to no avail. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) At 3:00 AM on the 26th, the fourth passenger train departing from Huanggu Village on the Beining Railway, carrying many family members of important figures, was discovered by Japanese troops. As the train passed Wanjia Village, it was intercepted by disguised bandits. The armed police on the train returned fire, and the locomotive sped away to escape danger. Two stokers were injured. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the derailment at Raoyang Station on the Beining Railway, some of the refugees boarded the rescue train and arrived in Tianjin, while the rest remained at the Baiqibao Station. The derailed passenger train has not been retrieved. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to transportation sources, on the afternoon of the 26th, the tracks of the Raoyang River on the Beining Railway were destroyed by Japanese plainclothes troops, and the 102nd passenger train derailed. As of the evening of the 27th, the overturned train had not yet been put back on the tracks. Among the passengers in the first and second class carriages, it was determined that two men and two women from Italy and the Netherlands, one German woman, and two Indian men who were not dead were taken to Xinmin Village by Japanese armored vehicles, intending to show goodwill. Two drivers and three stokers were killed on the locomotive, and four people were crushed to death under the water tank. The number of deaths in the third-class carriage is still under investigation. Eastbound passenger trains on the Beining Railway only sell tickets to Dahu Mountain, but only travel to Goubangzi, as it is too dangerous to proceed further. It is also heard that a Japanese company arrived in Goubangzi on the 27th to scout westward, with the intention of invading Jinzhou. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to extremely reliable sources from the enemy side, Japanese aircraft have machine-gunned trains carrying people fleeing Manchuria more than once. On Thursday, a train carrying several foreigners and many Chinese refugees had barely traveled a few miles when the sound of engines was heard, and then they saw it firing at the train, killing at least two people and injuring several others. Foreigners on the same train witnessed the victims and the bullet wounds. After arriving in Tianjin, photos of the damaged train were taken, so that China could submit the matter to the world for judgment. The British people on the train have reported the situation to the British Consul in Tianjin. It is now confirmed that two more trains were also shot at by aircraft. In addition to the aerial attacks, two trains were also attacked by bandits near the railway. It is said that the bandits had white cloths wrapped around their arms with writing on them, but the people on the train could not discern the words. There were no armed soldiers on the train, so it is incomprehensible why the Japanese aircraft took this action. (26th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) In the Raoyang River train accident, a total of sixty people died. Some drowned after the train overturned and fell into the river, while the rest were killed by bandits who boarded the train to rob. It is now known that there were seven or eight foreigners on the train, and one Chinese and one Indian person each died or were injured. It is heard that the bandits also kidnapped several Chinese passengers. (28th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Beining Railway Bureau and the Hebei Provincial Government telegraphed successively on the 27th that at 10:45 AM on the 24th, the 102nd passenger train on the Beining Railway, while passing near Xinglongdian Station, was pursued by a Japanese aircraft, which fired machine guns at the train, piercing the roof with countless bullet holes. One passenger died in the carriage, along with one Indian and one of our railway staff members, and one driver. The foreign passengers in the first-class carriage, including two Italians and one German and one Indian, were all unharmed and have been taken to Xinmin by Japanese armored vehicles. The remaining deaths, injuries, and losses are pending investigation. On the 25th, the 105th train, while passing Raoyang Station, was bombed twice by Japanese aircraft, but fortunately, they did not hit the train. The train increased its speed, and the aircraft continued to pursue it to several stations before stopping. At 11:30 AM on the 27th, Japanese aircraft circled in the air and fired machine guns at Baiqibao Station. Whether there were any casualties among the staff and passengers is still unknown. Also, the 102nd train on the Beining Railway was robbed and derailed between Raoyang River and Lijiawopu, and the damage was too severe to repair temporarily. An emergency route was being rushed to completion and was completed at 4:00 PM on the 27th. The 103rd train had already passed through at 5:00 PM and headed to Huanggu Village Station. According to a telegram from the Tongliao Machinery Department Chief, at 7:00 AM on the 27th, two Japanese aircraft, No. 29 and No. 51, came to Tongliao and circled several times, dropping four bombs, but fortunately, no one was injured. It seems that every train is being attacked, affecting the safety of Chinese and foreign passengers, which is a disregard for humanity and a violation of public law to the extreme. The authorities are in serious protest. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to a telegram from Goubangzi, on the evening of the 27th, after the 105th train passed Baiqibao, it was suddenly heard that a large group of bandits was planning to rob the passenger train, but they retreated to Dahu Mountain. On the afternoon of the 28th, 400 to 500 Japanese plainclothes troops were suddenly discovered departing from Huanggu Village on the 102nd train, stopping at Xinmin. The 103rd train departing from Shanhaiguan stopped at Dahu Mountain. The Railway Bureau telegraphed the 19th Brigade Commander Sun Dequan stationed in Dahu Mountain, requesting him to send troops to suppress the bandits. Sun was afraid of causing misunderstandings with the Japanese army and dared not comply. At 4:00 PM, the plainclothes troops retreated, and the 102nd train proceeded at risk, fortunately without incident. The 103rd train returned to Shanhaiguan, and the 105th train returned to Tianjin. Telegrams and telephones from Xinmin County, Xinglongdian, Qiansanjiazi, Huanggu Village, and other stations on the Beining Railway are all being monitored by Japanese soldiers, and it is extremely difficult for the station staff to report train information. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the morning of the 24th, the 104th train departing from Huanggu Village was machine-gunned by Japanese aircraft in Juliu River, killing five passengers. The train arrived in Tianjin on the afternoon of the 28th. Each of the first, second, and third-class carriages had eleven bullet holes, all shot from top to bottom. British and American reporters boarded the train to inspect and confirmed that it was shot by aircraft. (28th Dispatch)</p>

<p>but so far there is no way. Several grain and rice shops in the city have been robbed by poor people. Many citizens are moving. Although the Beining train is open, it is extremely crowded and there is no time to depart. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A certain foreigner came to Beiping from Shenyang and talked about the disorder in Shenyang, the depreciation of banknotes, the inability of the general laborers to make a living, and the difficulty for middle-class families to support themselves. Each bag of flour has risen to ten silver dollars and is not available for purchase. The sources of other daily necessities are constantly cut off, and the market price is far higher than the flood-stricken areas. After nightfall, it is a world of bandits and rogues. Robberies occur every day. Korean rogues are especially unscrupulous. All Chinese people will abandon their property and flee completely one day. Recently, Japanese troops have gathered in Juliu River, and the situation is extremely serious. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Two-thirds of the people in Shenyang have fled, because one, the cash has run out and there is no source of income, even if there is money, it may not be possible to buy food; two, they fear that bandits will take the opportunity to rob; three, there are rumors that the Feng Army will counterattack, and the order is deteriorating. Foreign banks in Shenyang have not opened because they are linked to Chinese banks. The Central and Jiaotong Banks first said that official funds were not allowed to be withdrawn, and private funds could be withdrawn at 50 yuan per person, but now, because the order is deteriorating and robberies occur from time to time, it is impossible to open the doors. Important people usually use checks and do not store cash, so life is even more difficult when the banks are closed. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) The Chinese Local Peace Preservation Committee issued a proclamation on the 26th, saying that the purpose of organizing the Local Peace Preservation Committee this time is to maintain local order, set up self-defense police, and maintain security, so that financial and commercial affairs can return to normal. All autonomous rights are handled by this committee, and it is hoped that local merchants and people will not panic each other. (28th Telegraphic News Agency Dispatch)</p>

It seems that the powerful residents have all left here, and those seeking refuge and leaving the country are still coming in an endless stream.

<p>Yoshizawa Declares Troop Withdrawal Within a Week</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations conference was originally scheduled to close last Saturday, but now, in order to obtain a guarantee for the resolution of the Three Eastern Provinces incident, it was decided today that the adjournment would be at the earliest on Tuesday. The Council will probably wait until after the Japanese troops have withdrawn before holding its meeting until Saturday. Japanese Representative Yoshizawa has now assured the League of Nations that the Japanese troops in Manchuria will probably be withdrawn to the South Manchuria Railway concession within this week. People in the League of Nations hope that once the Japanese troops withdraw from the occupied areas, negotiations can be held between the Chinese and Japanese governments. (27th National News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Regarding the Manchuria incident, there have been no changes here this morning. The Parliament will close tomorrow, and the Administrative Council will conclude its meeting tonight according to existing procedures. Under normal circumstances, after the closing of the meeting, it takes six months before the countries gather again in Geneva. The League of Nations Administrative Council's handling of the Sino-Japanese issue seems to be at a deadlock. The Administrative Council has acknowledged the veracity of Japan's promise to withdraw its troops as soon as possible and withdraw from the occupied territories. However, it is extremely doubtful whether the Administrative Council can have a resolution that satisfies China today. The Chinese representatives are extremely disappointed due to the change in circumstances. It is expected that the Administrative Council will extend its session in order to reconsider the Manchuria issue, but as of now, official sources still say that the Administrative Council will close tonight. It is generally known that the main difficulty is that China does not trust Japan's declaration that the Japanese army is now retreating into the South Manchuria Railway area. Shi Zhaoji received a telegram from the Nanjing government last night, stating that on September 25, aircraft bombed trains on the Beining Railway. According to September 25, Yoshizawa declared the day after the Japanese now withdrew its troops from occupied areas in the Administrative Council, and the Administrative Council actually wants to end its discussion of the Manchuria incident when it meets today. The Chinese representatives are very anxious about this. It is heard that the Chinese representatives and the Chinese government believe that the meeting should not be adjourned before the Japanese troops have completely withdrawn from the occupied areas, otherwise, Geneva will create a sad impression in China and lose China's trust in the League of Nations. At this critical moment, the diplomatic officials of Britain, France, and Germany are not in Geneva, and the authority of the Administrative Council has been reduced as a result, which is extremely unfortunate. The tense situation in Europe is really responsible for this. British Foreign Secretary Reading cannot leave London due to financial needs, and the Foreign Ministers of France and Germany have important talks in Berlin and cannot come. However, British Chief Representative Cecil has made great efforts to promote understanding between China and Japan, and his spirit and sincerity in performing his duties are commendable. (28th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Washington) Officials here expressed the opinion today that the Sino-Japanese dispute cannot be resolved in a short time. However, Japan will soon withdraw its troops to the South Manchuria Railway area and leave a small number of troops to guard the key points in Manchuria. This small number of troops will be withdrawn only after a treaty resolving the disputes between the two countries has been negotiated. The United States' policy on this case has been clearly decided. The State Department is currently studying various treaties between China and Japan and the history of Japan's interests in Manchuria, collecting all materials so that when the United States needs to continue to make recommendations to China and Japan, there is a basis.

<p>Hoping to Adopt the Most Effective Methods</p>
<p>To Maintain the Dignity of International Treaties</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The original text of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' reply to the U.S. government is as follows: The Chinese government received yesterday afternoon the note from the U.S. government delivered by the U.S. Minister to China from Beiping regarding the current incident in China. The Chinese government and people are very pleased with the deep concern of the U.S. government and people about the incident caused by the actions of the Japanese army in China, and the hope that the relations between China and Japan, like those between other civilized countries, will apply the principles and methods of peace, rather than resorting to force. The Chinese government firmly believes that the U.S. government, in issuing notes to the Chinese and Japanese governments, was driven by a sincere desire to maintain international treaties as a member of the contracting parties, especially the dignity of the Non-Aggression Pact signed in Paris in 1928, so that the treaty binds each contracting party, not to adopt war but to adopt peaceful methods in their relations. As a result of the Japanese army's invasion, our country's territory has been invaded, our cities have been occupied, and some have been looted. Our officers, soldiers, and innocent people have been insulted, injured, and killed. Even on the day when the U.S. government issued the same notes to the Chinese and Japanese governments, informing them to stop the use of force, the passenger train on the Beining Railway carrying refugees was attacked by Japanese military aircraft with bombs and machine guns, causing many deaths and injuries. Although the Japanese government has stated that it will take all measures to avoid the incident from escalating and will immediately withdraw its troops from the occupied areas, the Japanese army still has such new war actions. Even in this situation, all the people of China have been instructed to maintain calm and solemnity, deeply believing that under the principles of maintaining the dignity of international treaties of peace, the violating country will fully confess the crime of its violent acts before all civilized countries. At this time when international law and international treaties are being trampled on, the Chinese government cannot find other ways to satisfy the demands of international law and international agreements except for Japan to immediately withdraw its troops completely from the occupied areas and provide full compensation to the injured party, that is, the Chinese government and people. The Chinese government sincerely hopes that the most effective methods will be adopted immediately to maintain the dignity of the above-mentioned international treaties and their inviolable principles, so that all the efforts of all countries, especially the United States, in maintaining peace in the past, will not be abandoned.

Yoshizawa telegraphed Tokyo to ask for instructions on how to deal with it. The Japanese government has replied as follows: (1) The Japanese government has refused to form a joint investigation committee, and the League of Nations should have been able to understand the Japanese government's intention. It is now proposing to send observers, which shows that the League of Nations does not trust Japan. (2) Sending observers will delay the resolution of the incident, so the Japanese government rejects this proposal. Two (28th Telegraphic News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e20">Japan Advocates Manchurian Independence <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>It is strange that the Japanese are promoting what they call the Manchurian autonomous independence movement. The other day, Reuters reported from Tokyo that a Chinese delegation, including Yuan Jinkai, consulted with General Honjo, commander of the Kwantung Army, requesting assistance in overthrowing Zhang Xueliang to establish an independent Manchurian government. Today, a military news agency reported that the new regime movement for Manchurian autonomy has made progress. Yuan Jinkai and nine others have organized a local maintenance committee, intending to take all administrative power in the Northeast into their own hands. Another message further specified that the Manchurian independence movement has drafted a constitution and is preparing to form an independent nation from the Manchurian people, divided into the following points: 1. The four provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe, as well as Inner and Outer Mongolia, will secede from the central government and become independent. 2. The Independent Youth Party will be the main body of the movement. 3. Ambitious individuals and old warlords will instigate it, with restorationists participating. Those standing on the surface of the movement include Zhang Zuoxiang, Zhang Zongchang, and a faction of Puyi. The Japanese are fabricating these bizarre and absurd messages, their premeditation being nothing more than to achieve their long-standing goal of occupying Manchuria, and to imitate the Soviet Union's annexation of Outer Mongolia in order to destroy our three eastern provinces. Their conspiracy is nothing more than that.</p>
<p>Japan has long regarded the three eastern provinces as something in its pocket. For more than ten years, it has been deliberately planning and managing them. Recently, it suddenly used a fierce military force to forcibly occupy various parts of Liaoning and Jilin. It has never not wanted to swallow them directly and swiftly in one gulp. However, considering the international situation, it is unable to do so. The troops forcibly occupying various places cannot but be withdrawn, so it cannot achieve its openly and brazenly implementing its long-standing occupation plan. Thus, it has changed to an indirect and transitional method. Having already destroyed Korea, it has already used this method, so why can it not do so now? Moreover, its eagerness to create this kind of news contains two intentions. On the one hand, it uses it to intimidate Zhang Xueliang, so that he will submit as soon as possible and bow his head to endure its demands. On the other hand, it uses it to test the opinions of various countries. According to the Nine-Power Treaty signed in Washington in 1922 (Japan is also one of the signatory countries), each contracting country should respect China's sovereignty, independence, and territorial and administrative integrity. Japan itself cannot support a certain group of people to become independent in order to undermine China's territorial and administrative integrity. Therefore, it first releases this atmosphere to test whether the countries to the treaty have different words. It is also something expected. The Japanese's treacherous and cunning schemes have no limits. Now, the spreading of this statement only further exposes its long-planned ambition to annex the eastern provinces. Alas, how can one hand cover the eyes of the world?</p>

<p>Clash Occurs at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs</p>
<p>Wang Zhengting Beaten and Injured</p>
<p>Zhu Jiahua Requests Punishment</p>
<p>Japanese Consulate Mobilizes Troops for Protection</p>
<p>(Nanjing) More than a thousand students from the Central University marched in the rain at 9 AM on the 28th to petition the Central Party Headquarters. Along the way, they shouted various slogans to resist Japan and save the nation. Upon arriving at the Party Headquarters, they were received in the open air in front of the second gate by Standing Committee member Ding Weifen, who responded to each of their requests and accepted them. After more than half an hour, the students, learning that Central University President Zhu Jiahua was attending the memorial week at the Central Party Headquarters, demanded that he lead them to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to petition. Zhu initially hesitated, but seeing the crowd's intense attitude and fearing disturbances, he agreed to go with the students to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to petition. Minister Wang Zhengting initially planned to send representatives to receive them, but the students were greatly angered and went to the Minister's office upstairs to seriously question Wang Zhengting. A conflict broke out during the conversation. The students, unable to suppress their anger and indignation, used their fists and feet, slightly injuring Wang's head. He was taken to Gulou Hospital for treatment. Some of the Ministry staff were also beaten in the chaotic situation. Some of the furniture in the Ministry's reception room was slightly damaged. The situation was eventually calmed down after the military and police strongly dissuaded them. All the students then went to the National Government to petition. The military and police sent to suppress them remained in the Ministry all day and have not withdrawn. All the staff in the Ministry are on their guard, and there is a sense of panic. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At 9 AM this morning, students from the Central University went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to petition. Wang Zhengting had just arrived at the Ministry and was receiving Wu Tianfang, a clerk, Secretary Zhu, and a guest in his office upstairs when student representatives entered Wang's room and questioned him. There was some argument. A representative struck the table with his hand, shattering the glass tabletop. Wang was about to leave and go downstairs when several students went upstairs and were pushed down by someone resembling a servant, intending to protect Wang's departure. This led to a conflict, and Wang was slightly injured in the head in the crowd. He was escorted by military police to Gulou Hospital. It is said that the injury was minor, and he had a slight fever of 38.5 degrees Celsius in the afternoon. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>

They then turned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, shouting slogans along the way. Upon arrival, Minister Wang was in the office and sent staff to receive them, asking them to appoint representatives for talks. The representatives from Nanjing schools stated that they could not represent Shanghai schools and were asking Shanghai schools to elect representatives when dozens of people, ignoring dissuasion, swarmed up and went straight into the Minister's office, destroying objects and assaulting Wang Zhengting. At the same time, the various offices in the Ministry were also destroyed by the crowd. Wang's injuries appeared to be quite serious, and he is currently under medical care. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Central University faculty, staff, and students questioned Minister Wang of Foreign Affairs, dividing their questions into four points, ending with, "Sir, you have deceived the government and deceived the people. We have no personal grudges against you, but in our capacity as citizens, we request that the government dismiss and investigate you. We hereby question you and request a reply." (28th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Since the Japanese forcibly occupied the eastern provinces, the people have been critical of the diplomatic authorities. Minister Wang of Foreign Affairs has expressed to the central government his desire to have a more capable person replace him. However, the central government, considering the urgent nature of the diplomatic situation, urged him to continue actively. The situation has become increasingly dire, and the people's emotions are becoming more intense. On the 28th, the Central University petition group and others withdrew from the Central Party Headquarters and went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to petition. Upon arriving at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it was about 10 AM. The students shouted slogans, and their emotions were tense. In the chaotic situation, public property at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was slightly damaged. Later, Wang was encountered in front of the reception room, and the crowd was overly excited, with some shouting to hit him.

<h3 id="e22">Central Government Issues Letter to Students Nationwide <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>The People Should Be Under Unified Command</p>
<p>The Government Has the Discretion to Punish</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Executive Committee issued a letter to students nationwide on the 28th, as follows:</p>
<p>At this critical moment of China's survival, the government is entrusted by the people to unite the people's strength and bear the responsibility of weighing the situation and resisting foreign aggression. If the government does not respect the people's will, the people will abandon their government, and the country will perish. If the people do not obey the government's command, the government cannot restrain its people, and their steps will be disordered, allowing the enemy to take advantage, and the country will also perish. Alas, at this moment, can it be said that we can still not be of one heart and one mind, and bare our hearts to face the disaster of national subjugation and extermination under the unified command of the central government? Students nationwide are full of vigor and deeply patriotic. If students can be of one heart and one mind, obey commands, and be advocates for the nation, then the national situation can certainly be saved. Survival or destruction is determined by subtle signs, and life or death is determined in an instant. Therefore, we wish to sincerely inform you, students. The so-called unified command means that those above and below are of one heart, their steps are consistent, and they sacrifice their personal and partial prejudices and interests to contribute to the nation. If students now want to advocate for war against Japan, then let us speak of war. Modern warfare is not like the historical battles where soldiers were driven to fight each other. It cannot be fought unless the nation's land and water transportation are concentrated under the government's authority and commanded. It cannot be fought unless the nation's economy is concentrated under the government's authority and commanded. It especially cannot be fought unless the nation's people's usual freedom of life is gathered under the government's authority and commanded. The entire national strength must meet the needs of war, even destroying our houses and graves is not unfilial, and destroying our homes is not unkind. We ask, in this period, can people still each have their own opinions and interests without obeying the unified command? It is not only true in times of war, but also when enduring hardship and training, there must be unified command to have sufficient preparation. For example, students nationwide now all wish to carry guns to the front and sacrifice themselves for the country, but while their righteous indignation can reach the sky, they have no usual training, so they must be given short-term military education. During this period of military education, they sacrifice the freedom they usually enjoy in order to become orderly and solemn soldiers. If it is said that war has not yet come, restraints can be ignored, and work can be done intermittently, then the barracks on the dam are merely child's play. Once they face the enemy, they will be flustered and at a loss, making useless sacrifices and not helping the country's crisis. We know that students who understand reason and justice will certainly realize the necessity of unified command and should prepare for this even before the war. Since the Japanese imperialist army invaded and occupied Liaoshen, the news has spread, and the national spirit has boiled over. Young students have exhausted their clothing and shoes to provide disaster relief and have requested to join the army alone. Some have had their blood boiling and unable to be suppressed, committing suicide to sacrifice themselves for the national crisis. This spirit of sacrificing oneself for the country is enough to be a sign that the country will not perish. What is especially admirable is that the people nationwide, in their hot and excited state, can still be calm and avoid giving the enemy an opportunity to exploit, reflecting the civilized nation's character with the enemy's barbaric actions, thereby gaining the world's sympathy. We know that the great plan of survival depends on ourselves, but seeking sympathy is equivalent to dependence. We deeply believe that only the people's persistent and calm nature can lead to great achievements, and only a disciplined force can win on the battlefield. Therefore, what the people nationwide have recently expressed is not only passively preventing others from exploiting opportunities but also actively ensuring the survival of the nation. We earnestly hope that students nationwide will encourage each other on this good foundation and thoroughly achieve final success. During the Franco-Prussian War, French schools continued to sing under German gunfire. Those who have read "The Last Lesson" should understand this. The French nation, because of its spirit of persistent and calm desperate study, was finally able to avenge its hereditary enemy. If students nationwide want to avenge their shame, they should follow the Volunteer Army Regulations promulgated by the central government and strive for military training day and night. If they stop attending classes together when the enemy comes, it would only weaken our sharpened spirit and show weakness to the enemy. How can that be allowed? Now, some are using "no declaration of war" and "no classes" as slogans, and some are mentioning "sending troops and studying together." While their enthusiasm is difficult to criticize, they are actually mistaken in many ways when considered in light of reason and events. The question of declaring war cannot be weighed by whether students strike. If a country can fight but does not, leading to its destruction, it is the government's fault. If a country cannot fight but does, leading to its destruction, it is the government's fault. If a country lightly engages in war before completing preparations, leading to its destruction, it is the government's fault. If a country has completed preparations but does not dare to fight, leading to its destruction, it is the government's fault. At this time, the government bears the responsibility for the nation's survival and is entrusted with the people's livelihoods. What it relies on to live and die with the country and the people is only the determination of impartiality and loyalty, the trust of the people, and the exercise of its sole authority to determine the sole grand plan. If the government does not consider the nation's interests at this time, lightly yields to requests, or builds a house by the roadside, hesitating and unable to decide, then it is neglecting its duty, harming the country, and becoming a sinner for thousands of years. With great disaster looming, the people still do not trust the government, and the government still does not take absolute responsibility, then accusations will not cease, and the country will no longer be a country. Furthermore, the government bearing this full responsibility has the discretion to punish military affairs. Whether to declare war or not is not a question that the people who trust the government need to ask, nor is it a question that the responsible government should answer. While diplomacy should be open, military affairs are confidential. Patriotic students, prepare yourselves and be the government's backing. Quickly prepare to follow in the footsteps of those who came before. The government will never betray the nation. Alas, today's affairs are as urgent as fire, and today's country is as precarious as a pile of eggs. We cleanse ourselves with Premier Sun Yat-sen's legacy of saving the nation and the people and bear this inescapable responsibility. If it benefits the nation, we must die before the people. If it harms the nation, we cannot tolerate it due to our duties. We sincerely tell you, and we hope that students nationwide will take note. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Jinzhou dispatch: On the morning of the 28th, a German reporter interviewed Zhang Zuoxiang. Zhang said that the Japanese military's invasion and occupation of Liaoning and Jilin was met with no resistance from the Chinese army. The Japanese military engaged in massacre without prior notice or demands, and suddenly engaged in military action, which was contrary to justice and trampled on the people. Acts such as bombing by planes and machine gun fire are too inhumane. If the general public is forced into insecurity, taking risks would not only be a problem for China but would also cause global unrest. He hoped that all countries would uphold justice, and he would go to Beiping after the funeral arrangements were completed. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Electing Representatives to Petition Zhang</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Beiping Anti-Japanese National Salvation Citizens' Assembly was held this morning in front of the Taihe Gate.

<p>(Nanchang) He Yingqin and over thirty generals telegraphed, saying: Let all countries and newspapers be aware that as our nation recovers from natural disasters and banditry, Japan has brazenly sent troops to Liaoning, occupied our land, killed our people, burned our homes, looted our property, arrested and detained our local administrative officials, and cruelly harmed our border land, sea, and air force soldiers. They are even advancing on Changchun and Harbin, attempting to disturb Yantai and Qingdao. Their wild ambitions and atrocities are truly aimed at destroying our country. When the alarming news came, grief and indignation filled our hearts. If we can tolerate this, how can we be considered human? If this shame is not avenged, how can our nation stand? We, in the ranks, are soldiers, and we have always adhered to the Central Government's orders. How could we forget our duty to defend the Party and the nation? However, we believe that foreign aggression arises from internal strife. When the nest is overturned, how can the eggs remain intact? Without ending internal strife, we cannot resist foreign aggression; without resisting foreign aggression, we cannot strive for survival. Now that the Japanese invaders are rampant, the nation will perish any day now. We hope that all comrades in arms across the country will rise up, end internal strife, and resist foreign aggression to fulfill their duty as soldiers. We especially hope that our Party comrades and all fellow countrymen will quickly resolve to save the nation and relieve its difficulties, remember the warning of brothers fighting each other, unite in spirit, face the national crisis together, concentrate our strength to support the government. We are not talented, but we are willing to lead the charge, fight the enemy with arms, and determine life and death in this one battle. Success or failure is not our concern. We earnestly submit this plea for your consideration.

We hope that the leaders of the Party and the nation will discard their old grievances and jointly face the national crisis." (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>

<p>(Shantou) On the 28th, the Shantou Party Headquarters convened a meeting of citizen representatives at the Grand Theater, attended by three thousand people. Japanese residents took refuge in the consulate, and some Japanese sailors entered the consulate. The authorities dispatched additional armed military police to protect it. Security was extremely tight on Wai Ma Road. All stores, customs, and post offices in the city flew flags at half-mast, closed for one day, and suspended entertainment for three days. Police wore black armbands to express mourning. The meeting passed resolutions including: (1) Organize an anti-Japanese national salvation movement, with each sector electing one person to organize it. (2) Send a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, notifying all businesses that they must not receive or transport Japanese goods in the future. (3) All sectors must not buy Japanese goods, travel on Japanese ships, work in Japanese factories, or stay in Japanese hotels. (4) Request Hu Hanmin to take on foreign affairs. (5) Request the National Government to issue an order to sever diplomatic relations and declare war on Japan. (6) Telegraph to all armies not to retreat in fear from the Japanese army's atrocities. (7) All shops and households should post anti-Japanese national salvation signs. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Shantou) The 26th warship "Kaga" also arrived in Shantou. Treacherous merchants handled five hundred boxes of Japanese cloth in the port, taking the opportunity to unload them ashore. The goods piled up like mountains in front of the customs, blocking the road. Those who saw it felt heartache. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) According to sources, Zhang Xueliang, considering the tense diplomatic situation, believed that diplomatic talent should be concentrated. He invited Gu Weijun and Tang Erhe to Beijing to report to the Central Government on the truth of the Japanese military atrocities and to contribute their expertise. They will depart within days. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Gu Weijun said that the Japanese military's occupation of the Northeast was an act of destroying international peace. The League of Nations, for the sake of its reputation, would have to inquire. Fortunately, the incident occurred during the Executive Yuan's meeting, which was very convenient for Chinese propaganda. However, the League of Nations knew that it had no real power and could not take further action. Russia and the United States also had their own interests and would not use force at this time. However, ten days after the incident, China itself had no solution. The British ambassador was in Switzerland, the Japanese and Chiang Kai-shek ambassadors were en route, and the American, French, and German ambassadors were all absent. How could there be diplomacy? The Japanese had long made arrangements internationally. This time, they would not hesitate to make sacrifices. Their demands would not only be limited to the Jihui Road commercial lease rights and Huludao. They would also pay attention to consolidating their position, stopping the anti-Japanese movement, and importing foreign capital. At this time, we cannot talk about party interests. We should unite all the best people in the country and carefully study how to respond and save the country from this crisis. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) More than twenty members of the Supervisory Yuan and the Legislative Yuan held a discussion meeting at the Legislative Yuan tonight. They all said that members of the two houses, aware that the nation would perish any day now, should urgently plan concrete measures to save the country and jointly plan and propose suggestions to the government in their capacity as citizens for adoption. Unexpected rumors were untrue, causing various misunderstandings. As national crisis looms, absolute avoidance of emotionalism in dealing with external affairs is necessary to avoid creating new problems. The current government has also made up its mind, determined its direction, and does not need us to worry too much in the near future. This discussion meeting decided to temporarily suspend. In the future, if there are any opinions, they will be submitted to the heads of the two houses in a personal capacity and forwarded to the government. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>

Two people should be drawn from every hundred people in each county to serve as the reserve army. Based on the national population of 400 million, 4 million people could be obtained. The expenses should also be borne by the people, with the 98 people in every hundred jointly bearing the military expenses of the two. All active soldiers in the country should be sent to the front line to secure national defense. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>

<p>Aims to Solve Economic Problems</p>
<p>Agreed to Organize an Advisory Committee</p>
<p>Study Conditions for Cooperation Between the Two Countries</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 27th - French Prime Minister Laval and Foreign Minister Briand are visiting Berlin today, the first visit by French officials to the German capital since the war. Everywhere, shouts of "Long live Briand! Long live Laval!" could be heard. The welcoming arrangements at the train station were reminiscent of the Russian Emperor's visit before the war. From the train station to the hotel, tens of thousands of onlookers lined the streets through which the French politicians' cars passed, cheering continuously. After arriving at the hotel, crowds gathered outside the door, cheering repeatedly. To thank them for this friendly gesture, the French Prime Minister and others appeared on the balcony and waved to the crowd, who shouted even louder, "Long live Briand! Long live Laval! Bring peace to the world!" After the French Prime Minister and others retreated, the crowd outside the door had not yet fully dispersed, and the cheering had not yet completely stopped. The French Prime Minister and others then drove from the hotel to the French Embassy, where they hosted a press conference. Laval delivered a speech, broadcast nationwide by radio, saying that he and Briand came to visit to consolidate mutual trust between France and Germany and to develop the spirit of cooperation between the two countries. He did not say that misunderstandings could be completely eliminated, but both sides must consider possible solutions to prepare for a better relationship between the two countries in the future. The two countries must understand that they should not get involved in certain difficult issues (presumably referring to the reparations issue). Economic problems can be dealt with immediately. A Franco-German committee will be established to study various economic issues related to the two countries. The world is in an unprecedented economic panic and is now paying close attention to the Franco-German meeting. Therefore, understanding must be established because it can solve difficulties. Briand later went from the French Embassy to the grave of the late German Foreign Minister Stresemann. During his lifetime, Stresemann devoted himself to Franco-German understanding and world peace and was highly respected by people in both France and Germany. There were many onlookers at the grave, and the scene was silent and solemn. It was not until Briand got into the car and left that the crowd shouted, "Peace! Peace!" Then they shouted loudly, "Glory to Stresemann! Glory to the German nation!" In the afternoon, the French Prime Minister and others went to the German Prime Minister's residence to meet with German government leaders. During the recess, a communiqué was issued stating that there had been very satisfactory progress and that discussions would continue tomorrow morning. It also stated that the two sides had agreed on the principle of establishing a non-political Franco-German advisory committee. This committee, composed of senior civil servants, employers, and labor representatives, will discuss ways to improve economic relations between France and Germany, but any methods adopted by the two countries must not be directed against any third country. Tonight, German Prime Minister Brüning will hold a grand banquet to entertain the guests. This is a rare event in Berlin in recent years. The atmosphere is full of hope and friendship. General opinion believes that Laval and Briand's visit may have far-reaching results that will benefit both countries, but Germany is not entirely welcoming. The National Socialist Party still has doubts about it. Today, the party leader Hitler warned party members not to demonstrate against the French to avoid France using it as an excuse to make political demands that would be detrimental to the party. At the same time, the extreme right wing also showed no friendly signs. Its organ even made a statement in advance that it would not recognize any agreement between France and Germany. The German authorities have taken extraordinary precautions to protect the safety of the French Prime Minister and others during their visit to Berlin. This morning, when the special train arrived, the crowd had to stand two hundred yards away from the station, and special police forces were deployed to prevent demonstrations.</p>
<p>Kokumin News Agency, Berlin, 27th - The German and French executives and their political and economic experts met at the Prime Minister's Office today to discuss economic issues between the two countries. According to official sources, the scope of the discussion was very broad, and the results were mutually satisfactory, but it did not involve any third country. The scope of the talks was limited to Germany and France. The suggestions on industrial cooperation in chemicals, electricity, mining, and steel, as well as the conditions for organizing a Franco-German committee to study all joint economic issues, were discussed. The meeting adjourned at 6:30 PM and held a historical public banquet. German Prime Minister Brüning first stood up to speak, saying that for the first time in decades, German and French officials were gathering at the same table in the German capital. He then recalled the past when Foreign Minister Briand and Mr. Stresemann worked together for peace and close cooperation and finally signed the Kellogg-Briand Pact in Paris, which has become a permanent monument in the international community. However, the economic situation that the world is concerned about today still awaits our efforts. Prime Minister Laval then rose to speak, raising his glass to wish President Hindenburg good health and thanking Prime Minister Brüning for the grand banquet. He said that he and Briand were deeply aware of the great significance of their personal visit to the German capital. He also said that their visit was with the same intentions as Prime Minister Brüning had just mentioned. He and Briand did not want this visit to be merely a reciprocal visit. In the past two months, the world situation has been deteriorating. It is urgent for those with power to show goodwill and join hands to overcome difficulties. For example, Franco-German reconciliation will inevitably change the world situation. He hoped that the results of this visit would be based on the results obtained in Geneva and that closer economic cooperation between the two countries would be carried out. He earnestly hoped that the results of this visit would be able to make up for the usual rifts between the two countries and achieve concrete results. This is not only for the benefit of the two countries, but also for world peace.</p>

<p>Kokumin News Agency, London, 28th - Europe is continuing to roil in economic turmoil today. The stock exchanges in Berlin, Copenhagen, and Stockholm have been closed indefinitely, and Sweden and Norway have followed Britain's example and announced the suspension of the gold standard. The Norwegian Council of State also decided to ban cash exports, and the Swedish National Bank increased the discount rate from 6% to 8%. The Belgian government, in order to balance the budget, decided to reduce national defense spending by 350 million Belgian francs and postponed the construction of eastern border fortifications. Rome increased the discount rate from 5.5% to 7%, and Athens also increased the discount rate. At present, the only ray of hope for stabilizing the market is the French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister's visit to Germany. In addition, there is hope that a solution can be found to the Sino-Japanese crisis in the Far East.</p>

Seven Paraguayan soldiers were killed, and the number of Bolivian casualties is unknown. The Chaco, which covers 62,000 square miles, is an undefined border region between the two countries, and each wants to claim it for itself.

<p>Telegram from Yanzhou: To all newspapers: We were shocked and dismayed to read in the newspapers that Japan had unjustifiably sent troops to the Northeast, occupied our cities of Shenyang and Jilin, and committed arson, murder, looting, and other inhumane acts. The alarming news was received with deep sorrow and indignation. The Japanese's barbaric atrocities not only insult our nation's dignity but also destroy the peace of East Asia, violate public law, and expose their savage hearts. Our government should take effective measures to urge the Japanese army to withdraw from all occupied areas immediately and inform the world of the truth of the incident. If humanity is not extinct, justice still exists. Although Japan is barbaric, it can ultimately be restrained. As a good citizen and soldier, I have the honor to be a teacher and officer. At this time of urgent foreign trouble, it is time for soldiers to go to the battlefield. I have already encouraged my troops and am waiting for orders. If unfortunately, the situation breaks down, I am willing to lead my troops to the front and give my life. I also pray that my patriotic comrades and compatriots, mindful of the impending disaster and the daily threat of national demise, put aside their differences and jointly face the national crisis. The descendants of the Yellow Emperor, life, death, honor, and disgrace, are all at stake in this one move. I submit this plea in tears. May you consider it carefully. Gu Liangmin, Commander of the 22nd Division of the Army, and all officers and soldiers respectfully kowtow and affix their seal.</p>
<p>Telegram from Gushi: To all newspapers and elders and brothers across the country: I recently read in the newspaper that the Japanese imperialists, in disregard of international law, are taking advantage of our disasters, relying on their savage troops to occupy our Liaoning, plunder our borders, arrest our officials, massacre our soldiers and civilians, and usurp our sovereignty. They are also continuously transferring divisions stationed in Korea, preparing to invade further and further, disregarding justice and acting willfully. When the Xinwan Incident negotiations have yielded no results, and the country's indignation has reached its extreme, Japan not only shows no remorse but also exposes its aggressive ambitions, occupying our Liaoning Province, destroying peace, offering our beautiful land for their occupation, and seeing the descendants of the gods and heroes fall into ruin. This is truly a public enemy of the Chinese nation and is not tolerated by international practice. All of us Chinese people have an irreconcilable hatred. I, as a citizen loyal to the Party and the nation, and a soldier, have vowed to destroy the Xiongnu before dispelling my desire to wipe out Wu in ten years. As Jian Shu still exists, how can I forget the words of thanks given three years ago? However, incessant rains are causing disasters, and provinces are suffering from floods. Bandits are rampant everywhere, and the war clouds in Jiangxi have not yet dissipated, while the flames of war in Lingnan are rising again. To resist foreign aggression, we must first stabilize the interior, jointly save the overturned boat and stop the disaster, and unite against external aggression. How can we allow internal strife to continue? Do not covet the gains of mutual harm and benefit the fisherman. As the Book of Changes says, "Its demise, its demise, is tied to a cluster of mulberry trees." The survival of the nation hangs in the balance. This is the time for the court and the people to fast, and for soldiers to give their lives. I can only firmly request that our Central Party Department lead the people, order our diplomats to protest seriously, order our Commander and Deputy Commander to encourage the troops, and order all our compatriots, soldiers, and comrades to unite with a common enemy. I vow to fight and save the nation. In accordance with international law, we will not stop until we achieve the goals of withdrawing troops, apologizing, compensating, punishing the ringleaders, and guaranteeing future safety. I will encourage the soldiers to wait for orders and stain the Japanese invaders' blood to compensate for our sacrifices, sever the head of the Di tribe to appease this common anger. I submit this plea with all sincerity, hoping you will understand. Dai Minquan, Commander of the 45th Division of the Army, and all officers and soldiers respectfully kowtow and affix their seal.</p>

The petition objectives of Fudan University included: (1) Punishing the responsible officials in the Northeast for losing territory; (2) Punishing the Minister of Foreign Affairs for losing sovereignty and harming the country; (3) Ceasing the policy of non-resistance and issuing an order from the central government to all national troops to arrange national defense and vow to resist the Japanese army's free occupation of various domestic regions; (4) Issuing firearms to students of various universities. The petition objectives of Jinling University included: (1) Expelling Japanese troops from the country; (2) Requesting the National Government to order Zhang Xueliang to defend the Northeast to the death; (3) Vowing never to engage in local negotiations; (4) Vowing never to sign treaties that humiliate the country; (5) Urging all military and political leaders of the country to unite as one; (6) Requesting Mr. Hu Hanmin to immediately end his leave and preside over the grand plan. The petition objectives of National Central University included: (1) Requesting the promotion of peaceful unification; (2) Issuing a final ultimatum to Japan; (3) Restoring popular movements; (4) Requesting the issuance of firearms to volunteer armies; (5) Vigorously implementing revolutionary diplomacy; (6) Expediting the dispatch of ambassadors to various countries. Subsequently, Yu Youren, standing in the pouring rain, ascended the platform and addressed the crowd, stating that the government personnel were truly moved by the enthusiasm of the students and comrades from various schools today, enduring mud, water, wind, and rain. He would first express his acceptance of everyone's enthusiasm. He boldly stated that China would not perish and Japan would certainly be defeated, considering that the people of the nation have such enthusiasm at this critical moment of survival. Regarding the requests made by everyone today, he would respond to each item individually: (1) Regarding peaceful unification and the request for Comrade Hu to take office, the National Government had dispatched Comrades Cai, Zhang, and Chen to Guangdong several days prior. Their mission was that the National Government personnel could sacrifice anything regarding internal matters, only seeking sincere unity, practical cooperation, and a unified front against external threats. As for Mr. Hu's taking office and the Guangdong Committee's coming to Beijing, the National Government would sincerely welcome this and strive to make it happen. This is the situation of students from Beijing and Shanghai petitioning the National Government (photo taken by Guanghua in Nanjing).</p>
<p>Only in this way can there be no peaceful unification, and only through peaceful unification can the nation have new life. (2) Punishing the officials in the Northeast responsible for defending the territory: Japan had been plotting against the Northeast for decades, and it was difficult to guard against. The Wan'an Incident, the Fresh Case, and the Nakamura Incident were all incidents that were difficult to prevent. Border officials should naturally be responsible for defending the territory, but the central authorities should also bear considerable responsibility. The central authorities will definitely punish the officials responsible for this dereliction of duty separately. However, according to reports, Zang Shiyi was able to refuse to sign after being imprisoned and humiliated by the Japanese, which was sufficient to wash away the shame of the Northeast. (3) Punishing the diplomats: In recent years, the government's diplomacy has not only failed to satisfy the people but should also admit its negligence. The central authorities will punish those who do not work hard in diplomacy, not only by removing them from their posts, but also by strictly urging diplomatic progress. (4) Regarding the landing of Japanese troops in Haizhou, reports indicate that they have already withdrawn. (5) Regarding resisting the Japanese army, the government has not only appealed to the League of Nations but has also made final preparations. It is deeply believed that the government and the people, united as one, can certainly defeat the tyrannical Japan. (6) Regarding restoring popular movements, popular movements have been restored invisibly since the Sino-Japanese Incident occurred. The only concern is that unscrupulous elements may take the opportunity to cause disturbances and provide excuses for others. (7) Regarding recovering the lost territory of the Northeast, the headquarters had previously issued orders, and future orders may be issued to urge progress. (8) Regarding issuing firearms to volunteer armies, although the outline for the education of volunteer armies has been announced, there are still detailed measures to be taken. Firearms will be issued at that time, and there will certainly be no unarmed resistance against Japan. (9) Regarding not engaging in local negotiations and not signing treaties that humiliate the country, the Northeast leaders have already expressed this clearly. It is hoped that everyone can rest assured that there will certainly be no local negotiations. (10) Regarding expediting the dispatch of ambassadors to various countries, he had long felt that this was necessary and planned to propose it to the Central Political Conference. Facts would prove this within a few days to reassure everyone. After answering, the representatives of Central University handed over a letter questioning the Minister of Foreign Affairs. After receiving it, Yu Youren led the students, shouting slogans such as: (1) Down with Japanese imperialism; (2) Long live the Republic of China; (3) Long live the National Government; (4) Long live the Chinese Kuomintang. After retreating, the students requested that Chairman Chiang personally deliver a speech. Chiang initially planned to invite representatives from each school to meet with him. Later, each school elected three representatives to meet with him and requested Chiang to deliver a speech. Chiang agreed and, along with representatives and National Government members Yu Youren, Shao Lizi, Ye Chucang, and Central Committee member Chen Bulei, went to the second gate, ascended the platform, and delivered a speech. The gist of the speech was that the students from various universities in Shanghai and Nanjing had come to the government to petition, and at this time of national crisis, their enthusiastic performance was something that the government personnel would never fail to live up to the expectations of the young compatriots. The youth were the lifeblood of the nation, and their actions, words, and attitudes were extremely important to the survival of the nation. The government personnel were happy to see an orderly and organized petition, and the government would certainly accept everyone's petition and not disappoint everyone. After you return, tell everyone that you can rest assured and must remember to "hold onto your ambition and not lose your temper." All Chinese people must harbor revenge for Japan's tyranny. The youth should especially use a calm mind and passionate blood to cope with the national crisis. If they are too impetuous, it will only add to the nation's humiliation. The government personnel can accept the opinions of the petition and will certainly do their duty and use their strength to handle them. Please tell all the students to return to Shanghai as soon as possible, and those in Beijing should also rush back to school. Even in sadness, there must be an effort to study diligently and increase knowledge for every minute or hour possible, which is also a way to increase the strength to resist the enemy. It is hoped that everyone will listen to their brother's instructions and return early and focus on their classes. After Chiang's speech, the students from various schools shouted slogans and returned to their schools in formation. The students from Fudan University in Shanghai, who had come to Beijing, also went to National Central University in formation to stay temporarily.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Japanese Army Intentionally Destroys Beining Transportation <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Planes Continuously Bomb Trains</p>
<p>Using Internationally Prohibited Poisonous Gas Bombs</p>
<p>Tianjin Communication: The tragedy played out by the Japanese army outside the pass is escalating. Since the day before yesterday (the 24th) when they started using airplanes to chase trains, yesterday's performance was even worse than the day before. The day before, they only chased trains coming from Shenxi, but yesterday they intercepted even trains going east. Moreover, they expanded the scope of their actions to west of Dahushan. Their intention seemed to be to cut off the traffic between Ping and Shen in order to cover up all the truth between Liaoning and Jilin. At 11:00 AM yesterday, Tongche No. 105, heading to Shenyang from Shanhaiguan, was chased by airplanes west of Raoyang River. When it was chased to outside Yangqi Station, west of Raoyang River Station, a bomb was dropped from the plane, but fortunately it did not hit. The train did not stop at the station and proceeded at full speed. When it reached outside Dongyangqi, the Japanese plane dropped another bomb, which also missed, falling into a cotton field. Seeing that the two bombs had missed that day, the plane chased the train again and fired a burst of machine gun fire. There were no deaths or injuries on the train either. Yesterday afternoon, the fourth passenger train from Shenkai Ping was passing Zhaojiatun, a station east of Goubangzi, when suddenly a number of bandits came and fired guns at the train from both sides of the track. The train also accelerated at full speed. Although the train was not robbed of property by the bandits, seven passengers on the train were injured. Whether there were any deaths has not yet been ascertained. The agility of the bandits' actions was also similar to that of the robbery of Train No. 104 the day before. At about 3:00 PM on the same afternoon, passenger train No. 103, which was heading east from Shanhaiguan, was passing Juluhe Station. The station had been occupied by the Japanese army. A large number of Japanese troops stationed at the station intercepted the train and inspected all the passengers one by one. All the luggage and other items were searched. Whether there were any losses has not yet been investigated. The firearms of the escort police were all confiscated. One policeman slightly revealed his unwillingness and was immediately kidnapped by the Japanese army. His life and death are unknown. The current Beining Railway Bureau has decided to maintain its spirit of sacrifice on the section of the train outside the pass, and all passenger trains will continue to run as before.</p>
<p>The through train No. 102, which was strafed by Japanese airplanes with machine guns at Xinglongdian the day before, arrived in Tianjin at 4:00 PM yesterday. The reporter made a special trip to inspect the train. At that time, three injured passengers, one of whom had gotten off the train in Tangshan, and two of whom came to Tianjin with the train, were taken down by a doctor sent by the Beining Railway Hospital and taken to Dr. Ma's Hospital for treatment. One, Jiao Jiahui, is the head of the mechanical class of the Northeast Aviation Department. When he boarded the train at Huanggu Tun, because there was no room to stand on the train, he climbed onto the roof of the train and was injured in his right hand by a Japanese airplane. His index finger was shattered. The other, Zhang Lewen, came to Tianjin to find Deputy Adjutant Hu of the Second Army Headquarters. He was standing outside the train door and was hit in the left wrist by a Japanese plane. His skin was lacerated. According to the situation at the time, it was said that there were three Japanese airplanes, all of which were gray in color. They originally belonged to our country and were taken away by the Japanese army. Since the train departed from Huanggu Tun, they followed the train. The left picture shows the steel skin of a carriage hit by the internationally prohibited dumdum bullets used by Japanese aircraft at Xinglongdian Station on the Beining Railway.</p>
<p>As it advanced, one of the planes, numbered 109, suddenly descended in front of Xinglongdian Station, only a few feet from the roof of the train. The Japanese on the plane could be clearly seen. The train knew that it was going to be shot by Japanese planes to be killed by Japanese airplanes on the Beining train. Li Fengnian, a secretary of the Liaoning Finance Department (shot in the groin by a dumdum bullet, which blew away the flesh, and the bullet penetrated from the small thigh)</p>
<p>Shooting. It then accelerated at full speed. The plane circled the train three times, but seemed unable to aim. Finally, it flew in the direction of the train and returned after a certain distance, using machine guns to shoot head-on at the train. The roof of the train was crowded with passengers at the time, and when the plane circled, they all rushed to squeeze into the train. During the chaos, some rolled off the roof of the train. At that time, the noise inside and outside the train was deafening, and the cries of women and children were especially unbearable. After the plane opened fire, because it was shooting from the front, it killed two passengers and injured three in the front half of car No. 205, a third-class car in the middle of the train. The two dead were standing outside the train door. The Beining Railway train was full of refugees fleeing from Shenyang to Tianjin.</p>
<p>He was wearing a new blue cloth gown and behaved very much like a disguised military or political figure who had left. His head was blown open by the bullets he was shot, and those around him were splattered with blood. He immediately fell to the ground and died. His name could not be ascertained. The body had been removed at Xinglongdian Station. Another carried his wife and old mother. He was shot in the chest by a Japanese plane, and the bullet exploded in his chest. It seemed that he had been hit by more than one bullet, so his abdomen was broken and his intestines came out. He died immediately. His wife and mother were so grieved that they fainted several times. When the army arrived at Qingduizi, his wife and mother moved the body down. When asked by his mother, she knew that his surname was Li. At the same time, a woman was holding a child and sitting on the foot pedal outside the car door. Her child was shot by a Japanese plane and immediately jumped down and fell under the car. The woman also jumped down with her child. Whether she was also shot by the Japanese plane is not known, but someone saw that she seemed to have fallen on the track and was run over by the train. At the same time, there were also some people standing outside the car who fell off the train due to panic. The train was traveling at a very high speed, and those who fell off the train were either dead or injured. The number of them could not be investigated. When the bullets that hit the dead were examined, they all exploded after hitting them. There were also holes of more than an inch in the car where the bullets were left behind. Therefore, it is sufficient to prove that they are indeed a type of dumdum bullet. This bullet was prohibited by international agreements before the European War because it caused too much injury to the person who was hit, making it extremely difficult to maintain life. It violated humanitarianism. The purpose of war is to frustrate the enemy's fighting power, not to kill as many as possible. Therefore, international conventions stipulate that those who have lost their fighting power and non-combatants are not allowed to be harmed. Today, airplanes are using poisonous bullets that are not allowed internationally to shoot non-combatants without reason, and they are also people who are avoiding disaster. This is no different from bloodthirsty barbarians. How can they still be listed among the nations of the world? (26th)</p>
<h3 id="e62">Foreigners Confirm Japanese Army Fabricated Evidence <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, Dalian, 24th: A well-known foreign resident of Shenyang has arrived here and described the situation of the Manchurian Incident, saying that the Japanese are doing their best to make the world believe that the incident on the night of September 18 was caused by the Chinese army attacking the South Manchurian Railway. As far as I know, the Chinese army authorities have repeatedly received Zhang Xueliang's instructions, strictly prohibiting the army from causing trouble to avoid giving the Japanese an excuse, and even ordering the army not to defend themselves even if they are attacked. The evidence shown to me by the Japanese was several pieces of paper with slogans found in the Chinese army barracks. I often go to the Chinese army barracks and have seen them for a long time. They only wrote the numbers "Pay attention to the railway to your west". The Japanese then pointed to it as proof that the Chinese army was planning to attack. In fact, this is just a word of encouragement in the army. The Japanese also showed me an order signed by a certain commander. I know a little Chinese characters and know that this order only ordered soldiers of a certain regiment to perform a certain service on a certain day. The service and time have nothing to do with this incident. What is even more strange is that the order was dated September 19, which happened to be the day after the incident occurred. Although Shenyang currently claims to be peaceful on the surface, there are many incidents that foreigners do not know about. Two days ago, the Japanese promised to use Chinese police to patrol the streets unarmed, but after appearing in the morning, they disappeared. According to news from the Chinese, Japanese soldiers entered the police station and shot 30 people for no reason, so the remaining police all went on strike. Japanese soldiers are making trouble for the Chinese everywhere and are searching for privately hidden weapons and money under the pretext of searching for weapons. I have also personally experienced it. Two days ago, when I was on my way to Huanggu Tun, I was stopped and searched by a Japanese soldier. I had three or four ten yuan bills in my pocket. After the Japanese soldier found them, he took one of them and said in Chinese, "Give me one."</p>

<p>Send Workers to Lay the Dunhua-Huiyuan Railway Tracks</p>
<p>Jilin Communication: Since the Japanese army used lightning speed to resolve the Changchun Nanling garrison before dawn on the 18th, all telephone and telegraph lines were cut off, causing Jilin to have no news. Moreover, newspapers from other ports were also withheld. On the 21st, acting Chairman Xi Qia and the Japanese advisor to the provincial government took a special train to Tumenling to visit the Japanese army. At 2:00 PM, a Japanese plane flew over the provincial capital's airspace. The flight distance from the ground was quite low, about 200 meters, and many leaflets were scattered. It circled in the air for several hours before leaving. At 9:00 PM that night, the Japanese army opened three armored trains from Changchun, and more than 1,000 Japanese troops got off the train at the Xiajiutai Rubber Factory along the way, about 200 people. At the same time, a part of the market in Xiajiutai was burned down. After the Japanese army arrived in Jilin, they first occupied various agencies and also occupied various key passes outside the city. All city gates were guarded by Japanese troops. The official bank was also completely occupied by the Japanese army. Jilin University and the provincial party headquarters were filled with Japanese troops. The area near the Japanese consulate was closed to pedestrians. Large cannons and machine guns were erected, and machine guns were erected at various street intersections. The drivers of the Jichang and Jidun roads were replaced by Japanese, and the station masters were also replaced by Japanese. The current transportation on both roads is completely controlled by the Japanese. Our army retreated without resistance. The Japanese army also forced Xi Qia to order all armies and security regiments to surrender their weapons. Yesterday, two companies of the 34th Regiment had their weapons surrendered. The remaining armies all withdrew to the mountains to avoid their sharp edge. Today (the 23rd), two more trains of Japanese troops arrived. The commander was Lieutenant General Tamon Jiro, commander of the Second Division. The headquarters was located at the Nagoya Hotel on Dongma Road. This morning, 600 Japanese troops departed from Jilin to Dunhua. The Jidun Road has now been completely occupied, and it is heard that another train of engineers has been sent to speed up the laying of the Dunhua-Huiyuan Railway tracks. The provincial capital is now completely occupied by the Japanese army, and more than 30 Korean prisoners have been released from prison. (September 23)</p>
<h3 id="e64">Record of the Tragic Robbery in Shenyang <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>At about 8:00 PM on the 18th, the Japanese army, under the guise of an exercise, test-fired cannons near the South Manchurian Road, and then fired live ammunition at the Beida Camp. The rumbling sound shook the houses and continued throughout the night. The Beida Camp was occupied at 3:00 AM on the 19th. The army stationed in the camp was the Northeast Army's 7th Brigade, about two regiments. They had already received orders not to resist, so there was no contact. Except for about one regiment that had heard the news earlier and retreated towards the eastern suburbs of Shenyang under the leadership of its commander, the rest were unable to retreat in time and were killed by Japanese artillery fire. The number of people was about 800 or 900 (no accurate number). After the Japanese army occupied it, they used trucks to transport away all the gunpowder depots in the camp. In order to eliminate the traces of too many corpses in the camp, they set fire to them. The black smoke did not stop until the evening of the 19th. The Northeast Wireless Radio Station near Beida Camp was occupied at the same time, and important machines were damaged.</p>
<p>After 10:00 PM on the 18th, the Japanese army set out in separate groups. About 500 people went to attack the mortar factory. As soon as they entered the door, they swept with machine guns, causing about 30 guards and workers to die. Many doors and windows were damaged. The Japanese army went inside and took away a lot of munitions. The important parts on the machines were also removed and taken away.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Japanese army attacked the police sub-station from the Maluwan commercial port area (bordering the Japanese station). They killed Chinese police when they saw them, and then attacked the Public Security First Bureau of the Commercial Port. Four policemen were killed, and the number of injured is unknown. The rest all fled from the back door (the corpses of the dead policemen were lying stiff in front of the bureau and had not been buried until the 20th). The road attacked and entered the city gate, and opened fire when they encountered a sub-station. At the same time, the Japanese army occupied the arsenal and the Aviation Headquarters (both late at night on the 18th). The guards all had orders and did not resist at all, allowing them to surrender their weapons. All the military supplies in the factory were taken away. The large pieces of machinery were not moved. About 150 aircraft stored in Shenyang were generally taken away by the Japanese army that could fly. The number is unknown.</p>
<p>After the Japanese army occupied the back door of the arsenal, they wrote in large letters that anyone other than Japanese soldiers entering and leaving this door would be shot.</p>
<p>At 5:30 AM on the 19th, the Japanese army set up long ladders outside the city to enter the city. The police, military police, and guards in the city had prepared in advance, and some had safely evacuated in advance, so the number of people captured and disarmed by the Japanese army when they entered the city was not large. All important agencies were occupied. The original wooden plaques were destroyed, and Japanese Empire occupation signs were posted instead. They entered the Marshal's Mansion (Zhang's private residence), searched and copied everything, and took away all important items. In addition, the items in various government offices were either taken away or left for the army to guard. There were only three or four soldiers guarding the door. The official bank, Bianye, and Zhongjiao Sihang were all blocked and monitored by the Japanese army (it was heard that the current money in the official bank had been taken away).</p>
<p>Zang Shiyi knew that the overall situation was gone on the morning of the 19th and telegraphed to summon various leaders to his private residence to discuss the aftermath. They were all monitored by the Japanese army and were not allowed to enter or leave. It was heard that their bodies were still safe. All 200 Northeastern Air Force airplanes of the leaders outside the city had been snatched by the Japanese army. The blue sky and white sun on the planes were all repainted with the Japanese national emblem. Eight out of ten houses were searched by the Japanese army, and valuable items were transported away. All public and private cars were also driven out for use.</p>
<p>In the panic, the citizens had no special actions. Businesses closed their doors. From the morning of the 19th to noon on the 21st, there were no Chinese police or Chinese soldiers in the city, and the city was in a state of government. They were still able to be safe, which shows the calmness of the Northeast people. Starting from the afternoon of the 21st, some Japanese troops and local groups in the city discussed with the Japanese side to release the captured Chinese police to maintain the security of the city without giving them firearms. It has not been done outside the city. Japanese military police patrol in groups of three or five. Robbery cases have rarely been discovered. However, on the 20th, dozens of poor people were shot and killed by Japanese soldiers at the Beining Railway Station for robbing flour from the train.</p>
<p>Zang Shiyi met with the Japanese Consul General at his residence and requested that he quickly maintain local security. The Japanese Consul replied that he had no authority to handle it and would have to wait until Commander Honjo of the Kwantung Army arrived. After Honjo arrived in Shenyang on the evening of the 20th, part of it was resolved on the 21st. The Japanese troops occupying Shenyang were Lieutenant General Tamon, commander of the 2nd Division of the Japanese Army. Those seen in the city included: (1) formal troops, (2) local military associations, and (3) youth groups. There were many announcements from the Japanese side, roughly nothing more than deceiving the citizens not to panic and prohibiting anti-Japanese behavior. Japanese officials appointed by the commander of the Kwantung Army, such as the mayor and police chief, were all announced on the 21st and are now in office.</p>
<p>The Beining train was able to barely run on the 21st, but it was necessary to board the train at Huanggu Tun. The situation was extremely chaotic. The post office was monitored by the Japanese side. Although it was still receiving and sending letters as usual, it could not be guaranteed whether they could be sent out. The news was not leaked, which was extremely painful. Telegrams were still not available. Banks were not open. Food and vegetables soared in price. If this continues, civilians will face bread problems and security will be very dangerous. The reporter goes out to inquire every day, but there is no clue.</p>
<p>Important people and their families either hid, hid, or have already left. There is no definite news about their whereabouts. In short, this place has completely entered a zone of panic. (Sent from Shenyang on the evening of the 21st)</p>
<h3 id="e65">People in Andong are Fleeing in Droves <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Gold Note Prices Have Fallen Miserably</p>
<p>American Ships Follow Japanese Ships to Andong</p>
<p>Andong Communication: The circumstances of the Japanese army's attack on Chinese streets and occupation of various agencies have been recorded in previous letters. Now, the situation in the past day or two is recorded below.</p>
<p>Japanese inconvertible paper money, commonly known as gold notes (colloquially called "old man notes"), has been popular in North and South Manchuria in recent years and dominates the financial circles of the three northeastern provinces. Each yuan of gold notes has been exchanged for more than two yuan and sixty-seven cents of silver. Now, it has suddenly fallen miserably. The reason is that after the Japanese army occupied Andong on the 19th, the silver market of all financial institutions in the port was automatically closed from that day. During this period of closure, the prices of other silver coins and currencies were stable, while the gold notes fell below two yuan from two yuan and fifty cents. As of the afternoon of the 22nd, each yuan of gold notes could only be exchanged for one yuan and fifty-six cents of silver. People are generally fearful and unwilling to accept it.</p>
<p>The Japanese army occupying the Andong County Government received an order from the commander at 8:00 PM on the 22nd to immediately dispatch a small detachment, about 20 people, to drive to Shahe Town Station in a fire brigade fire truck, board the train and set off. On the same night, a regiment of Japanese troops stationed in Korea also set out and passed through Andong northward on a northbound passenger train. On that evening, the northbound passenger train stopped selling tickets and only carried the troops that were dispatched.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 21st, an American warship arrived from Yantai, weighing 12,000 tons. Because the river water was shallow, it dropped anchor outside the Dajiang Estuary. The commander of the ship took a motorboat to Sandaolangtou in the afternoon to survey the water and immediately returned to the ship. It is said that the American warship came with the Japanese warship this time.</p>
<p>The city newspaper attached to the Andong County Government and the Business and Industry Daily attached to the Chamber of Commerce automatically ceased publication on the day the Japanese army entered the street. Because of the rumors that were rampant, the authorities planned to order the two newspapers to continue publishing in order to quell the rumors. The Japanese police station requested to review the sample copies of the two newspapers. It is still difficult to predict whether the two newspapers will agree.</p>
<p>Since the Japanese army entered the street, the well-established merchants and people have been wary. For days, dozens of households have taken their families on foreign ships to escape. They mostly fled to Dalian, Qingdao, Yantai, Shanghai, and other places. Therefore, the British Swire Shipping Company's Zhoushan ship was full of refugees leaving the port, carrying a total of about 1,000 male and female passengers. (23rd)</p>
<h3 id="e66">Widespread Panic Among Overseas Chinese in Japan <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese Everywhere Prepare to Leave the Country</p>
<p>Students Suspend Classes and Return Home</p>
<p>Two Overseas Chinese in Tokyo Brutally Murdered</p>
<p>Osaka, 23rd dispatch: Since Japan unreasonably seized our country's Eastern Provinces, the atmosphere in the Japanese mainland has suddenly become tense. For days, Japanese troops stationed in various locations have been acting as if facing a major enemy, conducting drills day and night, firing cannons at night as a show of force, and airplanes constantly circle in the air. This is both to encourage their own people's morale and to intimidate our country's overseas Chinese in Japan. Japanese youth groups and veterans are also practicing at night, preparing to declare war on China. Students and businessmen alike are holding demonstrations everywhere, shouting all sorts of slogans insulting the Chinese. Many Japanese thugs are eager to attack our overseas Chinese in Japan. Since the incident occurred, the Japanese police have also been closely monitoring the actions of overseas Chinese, prohibiting gatherings of more than three people. Newspapers are also actively inciting anti-Chinese sentiment among the Japanese people, publishing extra editions seven or eight times a day, falsely claiming that Japanese women have been killed by Chinese soldiers, and showing war footage filmed in the Eastern Provinces, subjecting the Chinese to all kinds of insults. In recent days, overseas Chinese in Tokyo, Yokohama, Osaka, and Kobe have been greatly alarmed. They have completely stopped all trade with Japanese businesses and are packing their belongings, preparing to return home en masse if necessary. Among the Chinese students in Tokyo, more than 500 are from the Three Northeastern Provinces. Most of them have suspended classes and have been gathering at the Office of the Supervisor of Overseas Students in Oiwake-cho, Koishikawa-ku, inquiring about news from their homeland. Since the 21st, some have been boarding ships from Kobe to return home, but many are temporarily disembarking in Tianjin and Beiping because they have no homes to return to in the Eastern Provinces. Overseas Chinese in other industries are also returning home in an endless stream. Judging from the current situation, the atmosphere in the Japanese mainland may well lead to a second Korean incident. On the 21st of this month, at one o'clock in the middle of the night, two Japanese gangsters suddenly broke into a Chinese restaurant called "Chuka Ken" in Tokyo Prefecture, and brutally murdered a Chinese chef and a waiter with knives. After the incident, the Japanese police arrived, but the thugs had already fled. The Japanese police instead claimed that the Chinese restaurant's business hours were too late, and that being killed by Japanese people was to be expected and that they could not be held responsible for catching the murderers. Afterwards, the Japanese police refused to allow Chinese people to investigate the truth. Therefore, the names of the deceased are still unknown. From this, one can imagine the oppression suffered by the overseas Chinese in Japan.</p>
<p>Osaka, 24th dispatch: Since Japan forcibly occupied the Eastern Provinces, overseas Chinese residing in various parts of Japan have been driven by patriotism to sever ties with Japanese businesses and are preparing to leave the country en masse. In addition to the 130 overseas Chinese who sailed from Kobe on the Nagasaki Maru on the 23rd of this month, about six to seven hundred people have been taking ships to Qingdao, Tianjin, Zhifu, and Dalian every day. However, many are finding it difficult to pack up and return home immediately because their affairs in Japan have not been settled. It is expected that most will be able to leave soon. Because overseas Chinese in various ports have expressed their determination to return home in recent days, the situation in various places is recorded below:</p>
<p>Kobe: Overseas Chinese residing in Kobe, upon receiving news of the Japanese occupation of the Eastern Provinces, held an emergency meeting at the Kwong Ngai Kung So on the coast road on the evening of the 22nd in preparation for any eventuality. More than 50 local community leaders attended the meeting and resolved to use the association's fund of 50,000 yuan to hire American ships to escort the 7,000 overseas Chinese in Kobe back home if diplomatic relations between China and Japan are severed. They also notified the families of overseas Chinese, urging them to quickly pack up their belongings and retrieve all their deposits from Japanese banks, preparing to leave the country if necessary.</p>
<p>Okayama: There are only about 40 overseas Chinese in Okayama, a very small number. In order to prevent harm from the Japanese, they all left the country on the 23rd and returned to their hometowns. Most of the overseas Chinese there are merchants dealing in buckwheat, sundries, etc. They have long been unable to bear the oppression of the Japanese. Therefore, when leaving the country, many have expressed their willingness to join the army and go to the country to share the national crisis.</p>
<p>Tokyo: Chinese students at the Army Officer Academy, concerned about national affairs, have no intention of studying and have now gone on strike. The 298 officer cadets have suspended all exercises and decided to await orders to return home. Only four or five of the more than 600 students housed at the Toa Preparatory School in Kanda Ward are attending classes. Chinese students at Waseda University and Meiji University have also decided to return home immediately. Yokohama: The total number of overseas Chinese in Yokohama is more than 4,300. Since the incident occurred, they have been preparing to return home en masse. In addition to the 25 people who returned to Shanghai on the Rokko Maru on the 22nd, several batches will be arriving in Shanghai soon. Most of the overseas Chinese in Yokohama are gathered in the Shimosan-do area. On the 24th, leaflets suddenly appeared announcing that the Japanese police will restrict the actions of Chinese people, causing great consternation among the overseas Chinese.</p>

More than 60 representatives attended and decided to hold a mass rally at the public stadium at 2:00 PM on the 27th. Propaganda teams will be organized by various agencies, organizations, and schools to go to various places to conduct practical propaganda.</p>
<p>Shangyu: Since the various circles of the county, braving the rain, opened an anti-Japanese National Salvation Committee at the Shangyu Xianxian Temple in the urban area on the 23rd, as the Japanese army relentlessly advanced and the situation in the Northeast became increasingly deteriorating, the masses became even more indignant. The committee has been meeting continuously for several days, emphasizing both disaster relief and national salvation. On the one hand, party and government agencies, organizations, businesses, and individuals have spontaneously transferred the money from the waste lunar mid-autumn festival banquet or dinner to the committee's funds and flood relief donations. On the other hand, they telegraphed the National Government, requesting troops to resist Japan. They also made large-scale speeches to towns, cities, townships, villages, and families in the county on the 26th and 27th. The audience was all moved. At the same time, the Bureau of Education ordered all primary schools in the county to organize anti-Japanese National Salvation speech teams and establish the Shangyu County Primary School Disaster Relief Fundraising Committee, issuing donation books to engage in propaganda and fundraising, based on the principle of not missing class. They also decided to organize a volunteer team at the Anti-Japanese Association joint meeting, asking the National Government to go to the front line to defend against the violent Japanese.</p>

<p>Enthusiastic Public Sentiment in Business and Academic Circles: Since the violent Japanese occupation of the Fengji Provinces, the people of the whole country have been filled with fury. However, there are still some treacherous merchants who are planning to transport Japanese goods to seek private gain. Even more, they are disguising Japanese goods as domestic goods and transporting them to the inland for sale. Now, the shipping industry in this county, such as Taidong, Laogongmao, China Merchants, and Xiexing, and other four steamboat transfer companies, have opened a joint meeting. They unanimously decided that from now on, they will stop loading all Japanese goods. If any Japanese goods are disguised as domestic goods for shipment, once discovered, they will report to the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association for inspection. Also, some young people here, in addition to propagating everywhere, are also organizing a national salvation volunteer army. The registration office is located at the Dayu Society in the North City Center. More than 20 people have already joined. In addition, all firefighters of the Central District Fire Department, in order to supplement their strength, have joined the Central District Business Corps and are receiving military training on a daily basis to prepare for future defense. Others, such as male and female students from county high schools, as well as the Public Education Museum and the Propaganda Department of the County Party Department, have been giving speeches and propagating for days, and some have gone to various towns and townships to give costume speeches.</p>

<p>Inspections of Japanese Goods are Extremely Serious: The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Investigation Section of this county dispatched more than ten investigators yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM to go to various shops inside and outside the city to conduct thorough investigations. Treacherous merchants were terrified and hid Japanese goods or sealed them in the guild hall, awaiting resolution. Also, in the postal bureau of the county, several treacherous merchants from other ports arrived a few days ago and sent Japanese goods to various ports to avoid the eyes and ears of the local national salvation associations. The incident was learned by the Anti-Japanese Association of this county, which immediately dispatched investigators to the New World and other hotels where the treacherous merchants were staying, as well as the post office, for inspection. The treacherous merchants knew that they had been exposed and fled, and their whereabouts are unknown.</p>
<p>The Disaster Relief Committee Appropriately Allocates Disaster Relief Funds to Yixing: The Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce Flood Relief Committee previously received a telegram from Yixing County Magistrate Sun Gongqi requesting relief. Because the disaster situation in Xiyi was also extremely serious, it was unable to allocate much money. It specially allocated 500 yuan and remitted it to the Shanghai Jiangsu Flood Relief Association for distribution in the county. It also telegraphed Magistrate Sun by express mail to inform him. Yesterday, the Disaster Relief Committee of the Chamber of Commerce received a thank you telegram from Magistrate Sun, saying that he respectfully received the telegram, and in addition to telegraphing the Shanghai Jiangsu Flood Relief Association to urge the allocation of funds so that they can be distributed as soon as possible, he also telegraphed to express his thanks, and so on.</p>

Therefore, the captain of the team has sent the two criminals to the county for legal action.</p>

<p>Various Anti-Japanese Associations Expand Their Organizations: Because the Zhejiang Provincial Party Department has been invaded by violence by Japan and the country is in danger, the people from all walks of life in the provincial capital are enthusiastic about saving the country and have organized various anti-Japanese groups. However, the names are different and the strength cannot be concentrated. Therefore, it convened representatives from various agencies and organizations on the 28th to decide to organize the Zhejiang Province Hangzhou City Anti-Japanese National Salvation Joint Association as the general leading agency for anti-Japanese groups. Forty-five members were appointed, and Xiang Dingrong of the Provincial Party Department and Pang Jufu of the County Party Department were appointed as standing committee members. All kinds of anti-Japanese joint groups that have been established in the city must be abolished and reorganized separately within a limited time.</p>
<p>Military Training for Provincial Government Staff: Because the Zhejiang Provincial Government Chairman Zhang is being forced by foreign aggression and the country is in danger, he specially proposed the establishment of a military training team for staff of counties, offices, and departments under the provincial government. Zhu Mingtao, director of the Fangce Security Office of the Provincial Committee, will serve as the captain and deputy captain. The Secretariat, Security Office, and the four halls of People's Construction, Finance, and Education will be divided into three companies. At 7:00 AM on the 28th, the Security Office dispatched personnel to various halls to begin military training for staff. Although it was held in the rain, the spirits of each company were high and the order was excellent.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education's Telegram Was Ineffective</p>
<p>The second delegation of students from universities and schools throughout Shanghai to go to Beijing to petition for troops took special trains prepared by the Railway Bureau from the North Station last night to go to Beijing to petition for troops. Nineteen schools attended, including 600 from Jiaotong University, 600 from Jinan University, 600 from China Public School, 300 from Guanghua, 200 from Chizhi, 200 from the Academy of Fine Arts, 150 from Datong, 160 from Tongji, 200 from Law and Politics, 10 from Culture, 5 from Tongwen, 2 from Aurora, Jiangnan, etc., more than 100 people, totaling about 3,000 people. At about 8:50 PM, they arrived at the North Station from various schools by van, and gathered at the station gate under the command of Liu Liangzhan, the commander-in-chief of Jiaotong University, and assigned vehicles in an orderly manner. The students boarded the trains at 9:15 PM. The special train was divided into two trains, each with 18 cars. The first train departed at 10:20 PM and is expected to arrive in Beijing at 6:00 AM this morning. The second train departed at 12:00 AM and is expected to arrive in Beijing at 8:00 AM this morning. Jinan University students boarded the train in Zhenru. All boarding issues were certified to the Railway Bureau by each school's letter and charged half price. In addition to wearing thin clothes, the students did not bring other items. After hearing the news, about 100 employees of the two railway companies went to the station to see them off, shouting slogans together. After the train left the platform, the sound of shouting "Long live the Republic of China" could still be heard. After the delegations from various schools arrived at the station, representatives from various schools suddenly received a telegram from the Ministry of Education at 9:30 PM, urging them to stop going to Beijing. The representatives immediately convened a temporary meeting at the North Station. The group believed that the content of the telegram was unclear, so they unanimously decided to continue going to Beijing to petition. The telegram is as follows: To President Chu of the Sino-French Institute of Technology and to the presidents of various universities and colleges, I have received your telegram. This morning, students from Fudan University went to Beijing and, together with students from China University, Jinling University and other schools, petitioned the National Government. The National Government has generally expressed its acceptance of the students' petition on several points. I hope that you will instruct the students who have not yet come to Beijing to stop coming in order to avoid unnecessary travel. Education Department Jian,</p>

<p>Chairman's Report: On this day of bleak wind and bitter rain, our association is holding a passionate temporary meeting of member representatives to discuss how to deal with the Japanese military's invasion and occupation of our Eastern Provinces. We must understand that the reason for Japan's invasion of our country is caused by the lack of unity among our people. If this continues, not only will the Eastern Provinces be reduced to foreign lands, but our entire national territory may also perish with it. Faced with the national crisis today, if our people do not wake up quickly and work together to save the country, the only outcome will be national subjugation. Today's representatives are all important figures in the business community. I hope that everyone will express their great ideas and determine thorough methods of permanently severing economic ties with Japan to save the crisis of the country's destiny, etc. Next, Standing Committee Member Wang Yansong and Municipal Party Department Representative Zhou Funong both gave poignant speeches.</p>
<p>Proposed Resolutions: After the speeches, the discussion of the proposals began, and the following items were resolved: (1) To telegraph the Central Government, urging them to immediately send troops to Japan, drive the Japanese troops out of the country, and recover the territory; (2) To urgently telegram the Central Government and the Guangzhou Committees, limiting them to come to Shanghai immediately to discuss anti-Japanese and national salvation methods, with the people of the whole country attending the meeting as supervisors; (3) To thoroughly and permanently sever economic ties with Japan, and if there is any buying or selling with Japan, once discovered, the people will strictly punish it; (4) To notify the Banking and Money Association to immediately stop lending money to businesses dealing in Japanese goods, and if any violations are discovered, they will be regarded as undermining the anti-Japanese movement; (5) To notify various industry associations to immediately establish Japanese goods inspection teams for self-inspection. If they still fail to organize and establish them within a week, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce will send inspection teams from other industries to carry out the inspection on their behalf; (6) To notify Chinese managers and employees of Japanese business firms and factories to resign voluntarily within a week, otherwise the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association will severely punish them; (7) To petition the government to order the customs to prohibit the import of Japanese goods; (8) To raise anti-Japanese and national salvation donations; (9) To organize a business community implementation committee for severing economic ties with Japan; (10) To order various industry associations to organize national salvation volunteer armies and establish them within a limited time; (11) The Japanese Marines set up machine guns and armed military parades in the Hongkou training ground and Jiaxing Road Bridge in the Shanghai special district, etc. We should ask the Chinese taxpayers' association to question the board of directors of the Bureau of Industry and Commerce for allowing it to run rampant and act illegally; (12) To prevent domestic goods from taking the opportunity to raise prices; (13) To convene a meeting of importers in this city; (14) To ask all representatives present to stand up and take an oath that they will never buy or sell any Japanese goods in the future; (15) To establish a National Diplomacy Committee; (Resolved to be handed over to the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association.)</p>
<p>Member Oath: After the discussion, the presidium led all member representatives to stand up and take an oath. The oath reads, "On September 28th, the 20th year of the Republic of China, a member representative of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, I swear that from this day on, I will never buy or sell Japanese goods. If I violate this oath, I am willing to accept the most severe punishment."</p>
<p>Congress Slogans: Slogans: (1) Strictly implement economic severance; (2) Vow to never buy Japanese goods; (3) Down with Japanese imperialism; (4) Long live the Chinese Kuomintang; (5) Long live the Republic of China.</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Sent Two Important Telegrams Yesterday</p>
<p>Telegraphing the National Government to Reorganize the Army and Recover Lost Territory</p>
<p>Inviting Committee Members in Guangdong to Come to Shanghai to Discuss National Salvation Together</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce immediately sent two telegrams yesterday based on the resolutions of the meeting of member representatives, as follows:</p>
<p>Telegram One: To the National Government of Nanjing, The Association convened a temporary meeting of member representatives on the 28th of this month regarding the Japanese occupation of Liaoning and Jilin. It was unanimously resolved that the officials guarding the territory of the province allowed the violent Japanese to drive straight in, and thousands of miles of territory have fallen to the strong bandits. This is truly a great shame and humiliation to the country. We should request that the army be reorganized immediately and that a date be set to recover the lost territory to fulfill the government's responsibilities. Respectfully, The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Telegram Two: To Committee Members Gu, Sun, Lin, and Liu in Guangdong of the Nanjing Central Party Department, The Association convened a temporary general meeting on the 28th of this month regarding the Japanese occupation of Liaoning and Jilin.

<p>Japanese Army's Brutality is Tantamount to Seizing the World Market</p>
<p>Enemies of Friendly Nations and Enemies of the World</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce hosted representatives from various countries' chambers of commerce in Shanghai (excluding Japan) at 4 PM the day before yesterday. Attendees included the Chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce, R. Hers Marshaee; the Chairman of the German Chamber of Commerce, Y. Boaeseu; the Chairman of the Belgian Chamber of Commerce, J. Hers; the Vice President of the American Chamber of Commerce, P. S. Hop-Kins; and the Representative of the Italian Chamber of Commerce, Dr. V. Jumagalli, totaling over thirty people. After tea and refreshments, Chairman Wang Xiaolai delivered a speech, followed by responses from the representatives of the various countries' chambers of commerce. The text of Chairman Wang Xiaolai's speech is recorded below:</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech: Esteemed Chairmen and Directors of the Chambers of Commerce of Friendly Nations in Shanghai, it is a great honor to have this opportunity to meet with you today at the invitation of our Chamber. We regret that we were unable to inform you of the reasons for this invitation beforehand, for which we offer our sincere apologies. We hope you will understand the unavoidable circumstances and extend your understanding. Thank you very much. This year is one of the most unstable years for the world economy. The hardships and difficulties experienced occupy a most memorable page in history. Despite the countless efforts of the world's great statesmen and industrialists, no perfect solution has been found. Therefore, our most important task today is to eliminate the accumulation of suspicion, strife, and selfishness, join hands, and engage in peaceful proposals so that the world economy can quickly return to its original state and the structure of modern society will not be fundamentally destroyed. This is truly an effort that humanity should make, especially ancient and advanced civilized nations. Those who act contrary to this are the enemies of the world. Our country, with its vast territory and dense population, and with its modern industrial organization still in its infancy, has the greatest demand for materials from friendly nations. Therefore, the Far Eastern market is indeed an important market for the world. If our country's international trade were to fall into a state of decline, then at this time of world economic stagnation, the sudden loss of an important market would lead to an irredeemable plight. Therefore, preserving the Far Eastern market is the same as reversing the misfortune of the world economy. Our Chamber believes that no one can deny this. Friendly nations also understand this situation, and for the sake of maintaining the common happiness of mankind, they hope for our country's peace and stability, contributing to the world economy. Unfortunately, this mentality is the opposite of that of Japan alone. Recently, they have even condoned their soldiers to act freely, attacking cities and seizing weapons, and arbitrarily occupying our country's Liaoning and Jilin provinces. Such actions are unprecedented in the history of modern civilization. Our Chamber not only feels sorry for the other party but also feels sorry for human civilization. You should know that the three northeastern provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang are newly developed regions of our country with vast land and sparse population. The soybean crop alone is enough to supply the great needs of the European market. The remaining forests and minerals are hidden in the ground, waiting to be developed. The need for assistance from friendly nations' capital and technology is countless. Gentlemen, you should still remember the proposal by U.S. Secretary of State Knox to borrow money to build the Jin-Ai Railway. Who destroyed it? Recently, this kind of hideous face has become more and more obvious, and they directly want to seize it all by force of arms. Judging by their actions, it is tantamount to seizing the main market of the Far East and even the most promising market in the future. It is truly an enemy of friendly nations and an enemy of mankind. Let us take a step back and speak of the present relationship, regardless of the future situation. This year, the Yangtze River basin suffered an unprecedented flood, affecting a total of sixty to seventy million people. These people have all lost their purchasing power, so commerce in the Yangtze River area this year will inevitably decline abnormally. What we rely on to restore vitality is entirely the three northeastern provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang. The harvest of farmland in these three provinces, except for a corner of western Liaoning, is very rich. Therefore, this kind of violent seizure and violent control, if extended for one day, will destroy commerce for one more day. This year, the trade of friendly nations with China will inevitably fall into an unprecedented tragedy. It can be asserted that not only will there be a major wound in the current world economic downturn, but it will also harm the vital interests of overseas Chinese merchants. Therefore, the purpose of our Chamber in inviting you today is to hope that you will put aside political relations and consider only commercial interests. You should also petition your respective governments to pay attention to the serious changes in the Far East, provide practical and effective assistance, reduce the pain of the commercial future, and establish a deep foundation of friendship with China. This is truly the only wish of our Chamber on behalf of the business community towards you. In addition, there is another important statement that we hope you will pay attention to. Today, our country is experiencing such a major stimulus, and because of the urgent need to find substitutes for various commodities, we will inevitably turn to friendly nations for them. However, due to the long sea voyage, high costs, and prices and other conditions, or the inability to have equal convenience, this will be enough to hinder the commercial future. Therefore, our Chamber hopes that at this meeting, a new commercial foundation can be established. How should friendly nations find ways to fully supplement all currently needed substitutes so that consumers do not have to worry about shortages? How should prices and conditions be made as convenient as possible so that those who place orders do not feel inconvenienced? If gentlemen consider this in depth, there should be proper solutions that satisfy both parties. If you see this as a good opportunity to enhance trade between the two countries and think there is a possibility of consultation, our Chamber will choose a date to introduce relevant industries to discuss with you in person. We would like to express this intention as a preliminary inquiry. Finally, our Chamber has one more thing to say to you. Since the unfortunate news from Liaoning and Jilin provinces was spread, friendly nations have been able to understand our country's attitude and give full sympathy. This can be seen from the recent enthusiastic situation of the League of Nations, which is enough to prove that the world is moving towards peace and mutual assistance. Although there are short-sighted countries that violate the trend, they will eventually be intolerant of public opinion. This kind of public opinion sanction may not be as effective as military sanctions, but it is truly good news for mankind. Our Chamber, on behalf of the business community, would like to express our warm gratitude to you and hope that this intention will be conveyed to your respective governments.</p>

<h3 id="e81">Initiating the Organization of Merchant Boy Scout Troups <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>The City Boy Scout Association Informs National Merchants and People</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce Boy Scout Association issued a statement to national merchants and people, saying: "The Japanese invasion and annexation of the Northeast, the country's demise is imminent, all our compatriots should wake up and resist Japan. Japan has only sixty million people and a small territory... (omitted above)... The main purpose of Boy Scout training is twofold: first, in times of national peace and prosperity, through disciplined and organized training, to cultivate healthy morals, physique, intelligence, and young people with a sense of national mission, and to save the nation from those who are drunken, dreamy, and decadent; second, in times of national war, these energetic people will add military training to the three-level curriculum they usually receive, such as signaling, field warfare, surveying, scouting, mapping, and first aid. Once ordered, they can be organized and dispatched. Therefore, countries have risen to advocate it. They usually call Boy Scouts to promote unity, globalization, friendship, and peace. In fact, once the war starts, they are daredevils standing on the front line. Therefore, the United Kingdom has more than 600 social Boy Scout troops, while Japan, which invades us, even as small as a kimono store, gathers more than 20 partners to become a Boy Scout troop. Its strategy for training young people is meticulous and should not be underestimated. Looking back at our country's merchants, when encountering national humiliation, they send telegrams and publish declarations as embellishments. Those who organize volunteer armies and daredevil teams, once time passes, those who resist Japanese goods will hold banquets and socialize with Japanese merchants. Those who join the army have also been enjoying themselves in theaters and dance halls. It is said that they only have a minute of enthusiasm, which is not a false accusation. Therefore, today, to seek thorough anti-Japanese resistance and to prepare and resolve the issue properly with the Japanese army, the business community of our Republic of China should organize merchant Boy Scout troops. Our young people in the business community must sincerely accept this training. Expanding on this, all sectors, whether farmers, workers, party members, politicians, no matter what group, should organize it. Then, even if we are not like Japan, using this as a tool to invade others, at least the invaders will not dare to stride forward. When national disaster is at hand, we hope that everyone will rise up and advocate it. This is addressed to all the fathers, elders, brothers, sisters, and compatriots in the national business community. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce Boy Scout Association."</p>

<p>Intensified Military Training</p>
<p>Meeting: The Shanghai Northern District Defense Corps convened a meeting of the leaders, supervisors, platoon leaders, and trainers of each team at 9 AM yesterday to discuss anti-Japanese national salvation. More than 80 people attended. Corps Leader Wang Dong presided over the meeting.

The atmosphere in the entire venue was extremely tragic and impassioned. The following are the important resolutions: A. Issue a declaration of anti-Japanese national salvation. B. On the passive side, strictly implement economic severance with Japan. The corps headquarters will formulate a vow, which will be sworn unanimously during the drill. C. On the active side, intensify military training. (1) Each team should effectively reorganize the quality of existing members, eliminating the weak and retaining the strong. (2) Recruit new members. Any citizen with a proper occupation, aged between 20 and 35, should provide their own clothing, obtain a guarantee from the store, and submit a volunteer application to be reviewed and enlisted. (3) Each team should increase training during morning and evening exercises and focus on running practice. (4) There will be a joint exercise once a week, and field exercises will be scheduled regularly. D. Submit to the Defense Corps Management Committee and then to the Shanghai Municipal Government.

Take a calm attitude and strive to prepare for anti-Japanese national salvation in a calm spirit. The meeting adjourned at 12 o'clock.</p>
<p>Declaration: The Shanghai Northern District Defense Corps' Declaration of Anti-Japanese National Salvation states: "Japanese imperialism has been plotting to seize Manchuria and Mongolia for a long time. This time, taking advantage of our national disaster and internal troubles, in the midst of fiery heat and deep water, they sent troops to the Northeast, attacked and occupied Shenyang, seized dozens of cities, and invaded thousands of miles of land. Wherever the brutal army went, the houses were destroyed, compatriots were brutally raped and murdered, villages and neighborhoods were painfully burned and looted, military and civilian officials were all imprisoned, factories and barracks were destroyed, treating human lives like grass, and treating justice like discarded shoes. Their wild ambition is burning, and their desires are insatiable. They are also eyeing Tianjin and plotting to occupy Jiaozhou. Alarmist telegrams are frequently shocking, and the whole country is in grief and indignation. All those with life and breath are splitting their eyes and gnashing their teeth. If this can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated? Rather than waiting for death with our hands tied, why not risk death to seek life? Rather than stretching our necks and being sentenced to execution, why not take up arms and serve the country? Japan treats Koreans as obedient people, but the will of the three Hans to resist Japan has not weakened. Britain treats Indians as slaves, but the spirit of the two Indias to resist England is even stronger. How can our great Chinese nation be willing to be slaughtered by Japanese slaves and not struggle a little, becoming a sacrifice on their altar? Or are our four hundred million compatriots willing to be slaves of a fallen country and not stir themselves a little, waiting to be judged as prisoners? As the saying goes, we can only speak of justice after having power, and we can only maintain peace after having military strength. However, the time is dangerous, the situation is pressing, the war is already at hand, and the fall of the country is imminent. Ten years of recuperation and ten years of education, the Japanese will not wait for us. Weak countries have no diplomacy, but they can still decide to fight to the death. Besieged beasts still plan to struggle. How can we plan for a perfect solution? Planning in the room for three years has no success. Whether the tiles are complete or the jade is broken is determined in one word. Even if we are shattered to pieces, it is difficult to survive. If we can sink the boat and smash the cauldron, defeat is also honorable. This current great humiliation is not only related to the safety of the country but also the key to the survival of the nation. As members of the Defense Corps, we have the duty to protect the country and defend the people. Even if we go through boiling water and flames, how dare we refuse? We must strive to maintain a calm spirit, temper the morale of national salvation, vow to avenge national humiliation, and perish with Japan. On the passive side, strictly implement economic severance with Japan. On the active side, intensify national military training. We deeply hope that fellow countrymen in the sea and inland will unite and build a strong Three Principles of the People's fortress, follow the banner of the Blue Sky White Sun flag, advance together in the face of national disaster, and extinguish the Japanese bandits. We are willing to be pioneers for the national patriots, and even if we shed blood and lose our heads, we will not hesitate to turn back. We wait for orders with our weapons at the ready and issue this declaration with tears."</p>
<h3 id="e83">National Salvation Volunteer Army Working Intensively <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>The Number of Registrations Exceeds Two Thousand</p>
<p>Patriotic Youths Join One After Another</p>
<p>The National Salvation Volunteer Army of Shanghai has been working extremely hard since its organization began. In just a few days, in addition to the existing students and factory workers, the number of people who have registered with the association has exceeded two thousand. After 10 AM yesterday, the wind and rain were mixed, and the roads were slippery. Patriotic youths were not hindered by this at all and rushed to the association at Tianhou Temple to register. What is even more surprising is that Wang Peide, a visitor from Andong County, Liaoning Province, had been oppressed by the Japanese bandits on the 25th and escaped to Shanghai alone. He registered with the association, stating that the ferocity of the Japanese and the tragic situation of the compatriots were tearful. Huang Weishan, a former sailor on a British ship, happened to return to the country from London this time. He was saddened by the fall of his motherland and was willing to abandon his work as a sailor to serve. He sent a letter requesting the articles of association and stating his opinions, which were慷慨激昂and tearful, making them unbearable to read. Zhuang Jietao, a graduate of Huangpu, had held important military positions and was willing to serve as a soldier. The National Salvation Ten-Man Group of the Fengjing Sports Association was willing to lead the entire group to join the training. Western doctor Ni Kanghua was willing to sacrifice his profession to serve as a military doctor in the army. Jiang Guojun, a youth from the labor community, requested to be exempted from providing a shop guarantee and led a large number of comrades to join the foreign ports, determined to sacrifice themselves and save the country. Those who are determined to sacrifice themselves and save the country are flourishing like this. We hope that everyone will be aware of the crisis of the country and rise up to participate in order to save the country.</p>

<p>Executive Committee Meeting of the Shanghai Education Community. Shanghai. The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of the Shanghai Education Community held its third executive committee meeting at Wuben Girls' School yesterday at 2 PM. Sixteen people attended, including Yang Weiyu, Jia Foru, Lu Dianyang, Wang Xiaoying, Huang Zaoxiong, Ni Wenya, Chen Gonglu, Zhao Luqing, and Zheng Tonghe. Zheng Tonghe chaired the meeting, and Yang Weiyu recorded the minutes. The following resolutions were passed: (1) The draft outline of anti-Japanese national salvation propaganda was renamed the Guiding Plan for the National Salvation Movement. (2) The plan for vigorously implementing military training, for which the central government already has regulations, was incorporated into the Guiding Plan. (3) The plan for economic severance with Japan will be submitted to the Municipal Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association after revision. (4) Guide middle school students in propaganda based on the Guiding Plan. (5) Request teachers and staff of all schools to quickly organize anti-Japanese national salvation groups to lead students in their work and to contact the association at any time. (6) Recommend to the general assembly to elect representatives to petition in Beijing and Guangdong. (7) The next meeting is scheduled for Thursday at 2 PM.</p>
<p>Talks by University Presidents. Shanghai University presidents held a talk at the China Science Society yesterday at 12 noon to discuss ways to deal with Japan's latest atrocities. Sixteen university presidents attended, including Chu Minyi, Zhang Shouyong, Li Zhaohuan, Zheng Hongnian, Yan Fuqing, Chu Fucheng, Liu Zhanen, He Shimei, Ou Yuanhuai, Xiao Youmei, Fan Zhengbo (representing Wang Jingqi), Zhu Yingpeng (representing Pan Gongzhan), Lu Xiyan, Cao Huiqun, and Jin Tongyin. They expressed extreme indignation at Japan's atrocities. The presidents spoke one after another, saying that in this critical period, the Shanghai education community should strengthen unity, intensify organization, and serve as a strong backing for the government. It is not appropriate to disperse forces and act independently, and the steps taken should be orderly to be effective. Chu Minyi also said that the youth of Shanghai are particularly indignant about national affairs and are willing to die on the battlefield to avenge the country, which is commendable. We should cooperate with them to jointly save the country. All universities have earnestly implemented the seven national salvation measures promulgated by the Ministry of Education, one of which requires students to attend classes as usual. Although schools have temporarily suspended classes due to student petitions in Beijing, it is still hoped that they will not forget to save the country while studying, and not forget to study while saving the country. As soon as satisfactory results are obtained from the petition, classes will resume immediately, and studying diligently is an invisible way to save the country. At this time, various national salvation movements are temporary emergency measures to treat the symptoms. To achieve a fundamental and permanent cure, it is essential that students across the country study diligently and work hard. It was subsequently resolved to use the name of the Shanghai University Federation to send a telegram to universities in Europe and the United States, announcing Japan's atrocities, in order to arouse the attention of the world's academic community and rise up to make fair claims to restrain Japan's tyranny. The translated text of the telegram is as follows: "Japanese militarists are destroying peace in East Asia. Disregarding justice, they are committing acts of violence, occupying our cities in the three northeastern provinces, and slaughtering our people. Now military actions continue unabated. Warships have been dispatched to various locations along our coast to demonstrate. Cruel and tyrannical, they willingly act as the instigators of war. Our people can no longer tolerate this and will rise up in legitimate defense. The League of Nations has recently expressed its views on Japan's atrocities, but it has not yet been resolved. We deeply hope that your university president and the education community of your country will uphold humanitarianism and rise up to uphold justice, so as to avoid the spread of war. Shanghai University Federation, grateful."</p>

<p>International Propaganda Exposing the Ugly Acts of the Violent Japanese</p>
<p>All staff members of the Chinese National Anti-Narcotics Association are extremely indignant about the violent Japanese occupation of the Northeast and the large-scale massacres. In addition to sending representatives to actively participate in the city's anti-Japanese movement, they have also formed an anti-Japanese national salvation group to actively carry out its work. The Anti-Japanese work was decided by the Association's Cadre Department to change this year's Anti-Drug Week to Anti-Drug and Anti-Japanese Week, leading more than 400 anti-drug organizations across the country to unanimously oppose Japan, collect clear evidence, and announce the fact that the Japanese have historically spread opium, morphine, heroin and other drugs in order to anesthetize and poison our people, in order to arouse the Chinese people's thorough understanding and awareness of Japan. At the same time, it instructed the Association's international propagandist stationed in the United States to actively propagate and expose the ugly acts of the Japanese in China in order to win a just international verdict, and to publish anti-Japanese declarations and anti-drug and anti-Japanese posters to be distributed among various anti-drug organizations. At the same time, representatives were sent to Beijing to submit a petition, advocating: (1) Notify the Japanese troops to withdraw from the occupied areas within a time limit, or formally declare war. (2) Find ways to accommodate the compatriots in distress in the Northeast. (3) Stop foreign warships from entering our country's territorial waters. (4) Gather military, political, and diplomatic talents from all aspects within China to form the highest capable government. (5) Implement open diplomacy and punish diplomats who humiliate the country and forfeit its power.

<p>The First District Party Department Requests Implementation of Military Training</p>
<p>The First District Party Department submitted a document to the Municipal Party Department yesterday, stating: "It is submitted for the purpose of requesting party members to implement military training on a specific date, and forwarding it to the central government to order the entire country to implement it uniformly to save the crisis." All three northeastern provinces of our country have been occupied by the violent Japanese army, countless compatriots have been harmed, and property losses have been enormous. It is most heartbreaking and tragic. The Japanese soldiers are further encroaching on Beiping and Tianjin. At this critical moment of life and death, how can our party comrades sit idly by? The only plan for now is to implement military training on a specific date, form a party army, and go to the national crisis together to fulfill the duties of party members. Therefore, we request your association to implement military training for party members on a specific date and forward it to the central government to order all party members across the country to implement it uniformly in order to resist the violent Japanese and save the crisis. We present our words with tears and await orders with utmost urgency."</p>

<p>The National Salvation Ten-Person Group's Anti-Japanese Movement. The Joint Council of the Chinese National Salvation Ten-Person Group convened a meeting of the entire committee at the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association at 5 PM the day before yesterday, and announced in the newspaper in advance to welcome new comrades to join the registration and jointly go to the national crisis. After the meeting, Ren Jinping was elected as the temporary chairman. The chairman first gave an opening speech, stating that the association was established in the eighth year of the Republic of China (1919) with the original purpose of resisting Japanese goods. This time, the Japanese soldiers committed atrocities, invaded our land, and massacred our officials and civilians. If we do not rise up to seek survival, the country will be destroyed soon. Therefore, a notice was published in the newspaper to convene old comrades and solicit new comrades to hold a meeting to expand the anti-Japanese movement. We are determined to persevere in economic severance with Japan to the end in order to control the lives of the Japanese. Subsequently, it was resolved to appoint Zhang Jinglu, Chen Xingsun, and others as drafting committee members to draft new regulations and the group's creed within three days. The chairman designated Zhang Jinglu as the convener. New and old members who have usable opinions can present them to the drafting committee members, and it was decided to convene a general meeting of members at 4 PM on October 3. The address is still at the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association. Zhang Qucheng proposed the organization of a volunteer group, which was passed by the entire meeting. A temporary office was set up on the fifth floor of the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association. Those who are enthusiastic about joining can register there. Furthermore, since there are still many people in Shanghai who are living in a drunken stupor and indulging in the pleasures of nightlife, it is necessary to shout loudly to awaken the lost dreams. Therefore, a twilight preaching team was organized to go to various places such as brothels, dance halls, and theaters where gambling begins to engage in preaching at sunset and dusk. It is divided into ten groups, with three people in each group, and will be expanded when necessary. The preaching began last night. The team members each held a small white flag and cried out in their speeches, which moved many listeners.</p>

<p>Anti-Japanese Telegram from the Jiangxi Fellow Villagers Association. The Jiangxi Fellow Villagers Association telegraphed, "(Title omitted) Your Excellency: According to recent reports, the violent Japanese have launched a large-scale invasion, forcibly occupying Liaoning and Jilin, encroaching on Beiping and Tianjin, massacring our people, ravaging our territory, and burning our barracks and schools. Military and civilian officials have been killed and humiliated, and the hidden possessions have been looted. Yet, their ambition has not been satisfied. The whole country is in a frenzy, sending warships and dispatching troops, and the activities continue unabated, regarding our country as nothing and discarding justice. Upon hearing this, we are filled with sorrow and indignation. We humbly hope that our central government will quickly determine a plan and announce a policy so that the people will know what to follow and serve as a backing for the government. The Japanese have been plotting against us for more than just a day. Now, taking advantage of our disasters and the inability to rescue the dying, they dare to disregard the world and invade our territory and annex our Manchuria and Mongolia. This is a critical autumn for the survival of our country, and it is also the first step of the Japanese imperialists' poisonous methods. If we do not concentrate the power of the whole country and jointly seek effective responses, the country will no longer be a country, and destruction is imminent. We humbly believe that our ruling officials and prominent figures in the opposition, whether they bear the responsibility of building the country or are the center of the people, are all pillars of the party and the country and are connected to the safety and security of the country. Although there may be occasional differences in political views on weekdays, there is no difference in the heart of loving the country. We urge all of you to base your efforts on the enthusiasm of loving the country and make good plans to resist foreign aggression. Abandon your past grievances and jointly go to the national crisis. Military and civilian officials in various parts of the Northeast have a duty to defend the territory. Although the matter arose suddenly, the repeated concessions and loss of thousands of miles of land are difficult to absolve. We should ask the central government to strictly order those responsible to go to the front lines in person and make atonement by meritorious service and restore the lost territory. Do not allow them to use the excuse of non-resistance again, giving our solemn and splendid rivers and mountains to others with folded hands. On the one hand, an order should be issued for national mobilization, heading straight to the three islands, drinking the yellow dragon to the full, and wiping out our shame. Our authorities initially believed that the League of Nations had accepted our country's petition and waited for a long time, trying to discern whether there was justice in the international community. Therefore, we adhered to a peaceful strategy. Now, because of the strong Japanese sophistry, the League of Nations does not allow its intervention, bowing its head and not daring to inquire, and has adjourned the meeting. The testing period has passed, and the custom that weak countries have no diplomacy has become more credible. We are convinced that the only way to survive is for the whole country to mobilize and fight to the death with this ferocious Japanese enemy. This association is not talented, but we pledge to be the backing. We present our words with tears and still hope for a clear decision. Jiangxi Fellow Villagers Association, printed and sealed."</p>
<p>Declaration of the Newspaper Delivery Industry Trade Union. The Shanghai Newspaper Delivery Industry Trade Union declared: "At this time when our country is in great difficulty, Japan took advantage of the Nakamura incident to send troops to the eastern provinces, occupy Shenyang, kill our compatriots, destroy our military warehouses, destroy our construction, and imprison our officials. They also sent warships to our coastal ports to provoke and demonstrate, showing their strength and acting recklessly, and their conspiracy is fully revealed. However, Japan used cunning tricks to propagate to the international community that this incident was of a local nature and did not allow third countries to intervene. The so-called League of Nations also disregarded justice. Japan's plan for direct negotiations has been sold. If we do not save ourselves, our country will be in danger. All our compatriots, at this critical moment, should rise up together and fight to the death with the Japanese bandits. This association is willing to lead all workers to the battlefield to fight for the country."</p>

After the May Fourth Movement, Chinese established factories to manufacture various products, and the focus shifted from foreign goods to domestically produced goods.

Since the Mukden Incident, the industry has decided that from now on, in addition to using Western goods for unavoidable raw materials, domestic raw materials will be used as much as possible.

<p>News From the Jiangsu Flood Relief Association</p>
<p>Representatives From Baoying Western Townships Beg for Relief The flood disaster in Baoying is extremely severe. The first to suffer was the Western Townships. The association recently received a letter from Mr. Zhai Xuehe, a representative from the Western Townships, stating: "The disaster is appalling, and the people are in dire straits. Urgently requesting the distribution of emergency relief to alleviate the hardship. This year's flood disaster is the worst ever in northern Jiangsu. The disaster in Baoying Western Townships is even worse than in the Eastern Townships. The Eastern Townships only suffered flooding after the Gao-Shao levee breach, while the Western Townships have suffered from droughts and floods in the past. In addition, last year, the fields were flooded, and most of the rice and wheat could not be planted. The fundamental situation was already one of poverty. Since the beginning of this summer, the Huai River has been wreaking havoc, and the tides have turned villages into ruins. The danger of climbing trees and houses and the misery of being swept away by the waves occurred two months earlier than in the Eastern Townships. Even just considering the Shian and Sixi villages, the Dexing, Zhenxing, and Six Lian dams have collapsed one after another. The Cangtong Tai Da Dam was also breached simultaneously with the canal embankment. Thousands of acres of cultivated land yielded no grain. More than ten thousand households were destitute. The young and strong fled to high ground, while the old and weak were buried in the bellies of fish. Families were separated, and hearts were broken. Empty pockets made it difficult to find even half a meal each day. Lost baskets and boxes left people wearing only single layers in the late autumn. The sight of desperate people waiting to be fed is extremely pitiful. The urgent need for relief is paramount. It is heard that in the Eastern Townships, there are already refugee shelters and preparations for emergency relief for next year's cultivation. There is also an organization for cattle protection. The Western Townships are isolated and separated by Lake Chang, and rescue has not yet reached them. Xuehe and others are deeply concerned about their hometown and feel it is difficult to remain silent. Therefore, they have jointly appealed on behalf of the people, urging the committee to consider their suffering. In addition to actively preparing for winter relief and next year's dam construction work relief to save the disaster victims, please also quickly find ways to raise emergency relief so that the people can be revitalized. They will be extremely grateful." Presented to the Jiangsu Flood Relief Association.</p>
<p>Funing Red Cross Pleads on Behalf of the People The association received a document from the Funing branch of the Chinese Red Cross, stating: (Omitted above) Funing County is located in the coastal area of the Yellow River, with saline-alkali soil. Even in years of good harvest, the people often lack sufficient food, and the repeated famines and disasters have made their lives unbearable. This year's wheat harvest was meager. Since the beginning of summer, continuous rain has caused low-lying fields to be submerged. It was hoped that the rice paddies on both sides of Lake She and the dry land crops such as sweet potatoes, autumn beans, and miscellaneous grains in the northwest could provide sustenance. Unexpectedly, the breach of the canal and the southward flow of water inundated the land to a depth of four, five, or six feet. The entire area was a vast expanse of water, with no villages in sight and no mention of crops. Countless houses collapsed, and people and livestock were swept away. Food supplies were submerged. Boats traveled on land, and sails could be raised everywhere. The most painful thing is that the old and weak drowned and were buried in the bellies of fish, while the young and strong, though still alive, were mostly without clothing or food. Men and women were naked and living together without regard for kinship. The misery is unbearable to see or hear. This is an unprecedented disaster that has not occurred for thousands of years, and words cannot describe even a fraction of it. As autumn cools, the suffering disaster victims are gaunt and emaciated, sleeping in the open air and eating in the wind. The prospect of winter is even more concerning. Lake She is narrow, and the accumulated water is difficult to drain quickly. Wheat cannot be planted, and there is no hope for next year. By the time the water recedes, there is bound to be a situation of vast red earth. The consequences are unimaginable. This branch is a charitable organization and has long considered raising funds for relief, but the disaster area is vast, and a drop in the ocean will not help. Therefore, we must submit to your committee and ask you to have pity on the disaster situation and allow us to find ways to relieve the disaster victims, which will be a great blessing. We anxiously await your command. (Omitted below)</p>
<p>Disaster Situation in Linze Town, Gaoyou Received a petition for relief from 100,000 disaster victims in the Tenth District of Gaoyou: (Omitted above) Since the years of drought in the Republic of China 17 and 18, the people's livelihoods have been difficult. Last year was only half-ripe. The people believed that next year would be bountiful. Unexpectedly, heavy rain in the beginning of summer soaked the earth for months, and all the low-lying fields were flooded. The hope was that there would be autumn in the high ground that would prevent starvation. Unexpectedly, the canal overflowed, autumn had not arrived, and the three dams had already been breached. All of the high grass was flooded, and there was no harvest. Families were selling their belongings and crying loudly to protect the embankments and fortify the dams. Now, it is all over. The livelihood of 100,000 people in the entire district is on the verge of despair. The canal on the 26th August at the Junlou and Hetang districts burst again. The water rose with an additional 3 chih overnight. All higher elevations turned into a watery country. Houses collapsed and drifted with people and livestock. Disaster victims who were able to climb on roofs or green trees in search of help wailed a mournful song in a mournful atmosphere. It was a tragic picture to look upon. Those who were able to stay alive carried the old and the young as they found shelter, eating the elements and crying out for food. This is a disaster unprecedented in ancient times.

<p>Brief Report on the Disaster Situation in Shandong Province</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu Qinglan, director of the disaster area work group of the National Government Flood Relief Committee, previously sent a telegram appointing Zhang Shaotang to investigate the flood situation in various counties of Shandong Province. According to a report submitted by Commissioner Zhang, this year's disaster area in Shandong Province, based on the report received by the Shandong Relief Committee, includes a total of 45 counties. Among them, the most severely affected counties are Jining, Yutai, Jinxiang, Ziyang, Dongping, and Jiaxiang. The more severely affected counties include Dingtao and Linyi, totaling twenty-three counties. The less severely affected counties include Gaomi and Yuncheng, totaling sixteen counties. The most severely affected counties have been thoroughly surveyed, and the disaster situation is indeed serious and requires the allocation of relief funds. The cause of the disaster in various counties is due to excessive rainfall this year, flash floods, years of disrepair of the Grand Canal, and the existing river channels in various counties being narrow and shallow, making it difficult to drain the water.</p>

<p>The Japanese Research Society has been established for nearly three years, publishing the "Japanese Research Monthly" and various supplementary reading materials for primary and secondary school students. It is the earliest institution in the country to study Japanese issues. Since the occurrence of the Japanese violence against our Northeast incident, the society deeply feels that the work of studying Japanese issues has become even more important, and it is urgently necessary to develop the organization, promote social affairs, and intensify research. A board of directors has been newly established, with Ma Xiangbo and Cai Yuanpei serving as chairman and vice-chairman, respectively. Zhu Qinglan, Shi Liangcai, Zhang Yunhe, Mu Ouchu, Lin Kanghou, and more than ten other people serve as directors. It is planned to start soliciting members immediately and to compile a "Special Issue on the Japanese Army's Invasion of the Northeast," which will include detailed annotations and maps of Tanaka Giichi's plan to invade our Northeast, so that the people of the country can understand the entire plan of the Japanese advance to the north by reading this book. The book is scheduled to be published on October 15th. All subscribers to the "Japanese Research Monthly" will receive a free copy. The society's address is No. 6, Difeng Lane, Difeng Road, Shanghai.

<h3 id="e97">New Improvements in the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Since Commissioner Guo Waifeng took over the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, he has been proceeding practically and the rectification has gradually gotten on track. Recently, since Shen Zhongyi, Chief of the Business Section, was transferred to be the director of the Hankou Branch and Zeng Guangqin was reassigned to take over as Chief of the Business Section, Mr. Zeng, as a navigation expert, has been paying great attention to the management of ships. Recently, because the company's ships, except for those on the Yangtze River, can be profitable, the ocean-going ships are mostly old and consume too much coal, and the speed is low, and the productivity is weak, resulting in huge hidden losses every year. In order to increase the production capacity of all commercial ships and make the business more prosperous and the income greater, Mr. Zeng used the latest scientific methods to make detailed comparisons of the outbound voyages, coal consumption, and cargo handling of each ship. Among them, those ships with excessive consumption and little freight were shortened in their voyages and the dates of stopping and throwing anchor, and the capacity was improved to make the income and expenditure suitable. This can save hundreds of thousands of yuan every year. At the same time, the statistics desk in the Business Section was merged into the Audit Department, which was newly added, so that the authority is clear and the handling of affairs is orderly. It is heard that the improvement of the shipping affairs of ocean-going ships will be realized soon.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Decrease in the High Flood Tide <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>The Highest Was Only Thirty-Eight Feet This Time</p>
<p>The high flood season of the eighteenth day of the eighth month of the lunar calendar has arrived. The rise and fall of the tide are of great concern. Because the provinces have suffered from floods and the seawall at Wusongkou has collapsed, although various agencies such as the Municipal Public Works Bureau have tried their best to repair it, it is feared that the high tide will rush up the shore, which cannot be stopped by human power. The highest level of the tide in recent days is a matter of great concern to the public. It is recorded as follows: the tide rose to 38 feet from the thirteenth night tide of the lunar calendar. The tides on the fourteenth day and night were similar. Because the northeast wind was blowing on those two days, it turned into a northwest wind in the evening. On the fifteenth day, the wind turned southeast, so the tide decreased slightly. On the sixteenth day, the northwest wind rose, and the evening tide rose to 37 feet 3 inches and then receded. Yesterday's daily tide was between 36 feet 9 inches. The evening tide is expected to decrease rather than rise. If there is no strong northeast wind today, there will be no huge tide. Judging from this, the big flood of this year in this port should not be a concern.</p>
<h3 id="e99">The Japanese Salvage Ship Sinks While Salvaging the Yangtze River Ship <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>The Hull Was Completely Destroyed and Fourteen People Drowned</p>
<p>Two Chinese People Rescued, Four Died</p>
<p>The other day, the observatory warned that there was a strong wind in the Wenzhou waters. A salvage merchant ship of Yamamoto &amp; Co. in this port was salvaging the Yangtze River ship that had previously run aground and sunk in the Zhoushan waters. It was capsized by a hurricane, and fourteen Chinese and Japanese sailors and divers died. The details of this matter are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Ship Salvages Sunk Ship: The Yangtze River ship that was lost in the Zhoushan waters has been sunk for a long time. The cargo inside the ship has not been completely salvaged. Recently, the shipowner negotiated with Yamamoto &amp; Co. in this port to send a salvage ship named Shisi Maru, carrying technicians and divers, etc., to the scene of the accident on the 22nd to repair the broken holes in the Yangtze River ship in order to pump water and tow it away. Unexpectedly, on the second day of construction, a hurricane occurred, resulting in an accident.</p>
<p>Ship Destroyed, Sailors Fall into the Sea: At about 1:00 AM on the 23rd, a strong wind occurred in the area, and the raging waves broke the anchor chain of Shisi Maru, and the ship capsized immediately. All the Japanese technicians, crew members, and Chinese sailors on board fell into the sea, and the ship was destroyed by the waves. The crew members fell into the sea and scattered in all directions, unaware of each other's whereabouts. As a result, four Chinese sailors drowned and ten Japanese people drowned.</p>
<p>Rescued Sailors Arrive in Shanghai: The Indian-class liner Sheerpersis Maru of Osaka Company came to Shanghai from the port. When it reached 120 degrees east longitude and 27 degrees 57 minutes north latitude, which is outside Ningbo waters, it caught a glimpse of a wooden board on the sea with two people on it, calling for help loudly. It was rescued. The two people fainted as soon as they boarded the ship, and then woke up. One was a Chinese sailor named Gu Boshun, and the other was a Japanese named Qiaokou. The two said that after falling into the sea, they sank to the bottom of the sea several times. After floating up, they grabbed a wooden board and floated in the sea for four days and nights without food. When they were extremely hungry, they each grabbed raw fish in the sea to fill their stomachs. They thought they were going to die, but they were rescued. It was an accident.</p>
<p>Fourteen People Missing: Gu and others also said that there were sixteen people on the same ship. At the time of the capsize, they fell into the sea together. To this day, the life and death of each person is unknown, and they are generally hopeless. Among them, there were four Chinese sailors, as well as Japanese shipowner Fujii, diver Yamamoto, and Korean employees. Ten people are also missing. After being brought back to Shanghai by Sheerpersis Maru, they have been handed over to the Japanese Consulate and sent back to Yamamoto &amp; Co.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Changshu Sanfeng Temple Guest Monk Steals Paintings <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Famous Paintings by Tang Bohu and Qiu Shizhou, etc.</p>
<p>A Total of More Than Twenty Paintings Were Stolen and Shipped to Shanghai</p>
<p>Openly Opening Rooms and Peddling Everywhere</p>
<p>Arrested on Jiangxi Road While Looking for Customers</p>
<p>Sanfeng Temple outside the north gate of Changshu is a famous ancient temple with a large collection of ancient books and paintings, which are of great value. It has been kept by the abbot monk. Every summer, it must be taken out to dry in the sun to prevent mold and pests. During the drying period this summer, the guest monk Yuechun in the temple took the opportunity to steal more than twenty valuable ancient paintings, such as Tang Bohu's landscape hanging scroll, Qiu Shizhou's figure silk paintings, and Wen Zhengming's, Wen Su's, and Wang Shigu's landscapes, etc. He colluded with Chen Huting, the owner of a certain cloth shop in the area, to find a way to transport the ancient paintings to Shanghai, and opened a room at No. 40 Mingyuan Hotel in the Public Concession with the Yue monk, peddling them everywhere. After the abbot Xueshen of the temple found out, he immediately reported it to the Changshu Public Security Bureau. Director Yin sent the detective team leader to Shanghai to report to the police station and send detectives disguised as employees of a certain foreign company on Jiangxi Road. They went to Room 40 of Mingyuan Hotel and told Yuechun (at this time, Yuechun had changed into secular clothes and changed his name to Zhong Yulin) and Chen Huting, etc., that the manager of the company wanted to buy ancient paintings, and asked them to go to the company to negotiate. Zhong and Chen did not know the plan. The other day, they did bring the stolen ancient paintings to Jiangxi Road and were looking for the foreign company when they were ambushed by the Chinese and foreign detectives there. The two criminals, Zhong and Chen, as well as the stolen goods, were arrested and taken to the police station for temporary custody. The detective team leader has returned to Changshu to report to Director Yin, etc., and asked for an official document to be issued in order to apply to the Special Zone Court for extradition and return to the case for interrogation.</p>

<p>Dear Reporter, yesterday I read a news item in the "Local News" column of your newspaper on September 19th entitled "Woolen Fabric Expert Wu Jiazhen". After reading it, I was very happy because I have long been interested in industry, but I regret that I do not have suitable talents to work with. I have been accumulating my ambitions for five years now. Based on the experience of Mr. Wu as reported in your newspaper, it is probably not a false statement. I have written another letter to Mr. Wu separately, and I would like to ask your newspaper to disclose it. I intend to communicate with Mr. Wu. Your newspaper promotes industry and spares no effort. Can you accept this request? I wish you well, Zhou Misi, September 25th, one attachment.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu Jiazhen, I am very pleased that you have completed your studies and returned to China to contribute what you have learned to the country. I regret that I have long been interested in industry, but I lack suitable friends to assist me, and I dare not try it lightly. According to the Shen Bao, you are a woolen fabric expert with rich knowledge and experience. It is only a matter of time before you benefit the domestic industry in the future. I would like to take this opportunity to ask you to directly inform me of your address, "No. 3, Mutual Aid Lane, Xiaoxin Wharf, Hankou", so that I can communicate with you and ask for advice. I am in a hurry and cannot express all my thoughts. I respectfully wish you well, Zhou Misi.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Reader's Letter <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>You Rongbo (Opinions on Resisting Japanese Goods)</p>
<p>I read the "News from Mu Gengxun" and your reply in your newspaper on the 26th of this month, "How to Recognize Japanese Goods". I hope that the public groups resisting Japanese goods will compile various explanatory books on Japanese goods to help people recognize them, which is indeed a good method. However, I still have a little contribution to add. Of course, it is easier for those who are old in the business world to recognize Japanese goods. Furthermore, if all stores, especially major department stores, do not import Japanese goods and do not use Japanese goods to pretend to be goods from other countries to deceive customers, then Japanese goods will have no way to invade. At this point, most Chinese people can probably wake up and everyone can "save the country with conscience". Therefore, I hope that the business community will unanimously import Japanese goods, which is the fundamental solution. Even if there are one or two customers who want to buy inferior goods, they will have no way to buy them. Please persuade major stores to import goods with a conscience and not to take advantage of the situation and only seek profit.</p>
<p>(Reply) I admire your opinion very much. I think the gentlemen in the business community are also working hard for the patriotic movement and will definitely agree with your proposal.</p>
<p>An Yang (Anti-Japanese Issue)</p>
<p>The violent Japanese invasion is becoming more and more serious. Our Northeast provinces will soon be handed over to others completely. Anyone with eyes and ears is heartbroken. As evidenced by what is published in the newspapers every day, compatriots from all over the country, either in the name of groups or in their own names, are sending letters and telegrams to blame the government. Their anger can already be seen. However, the government still has no concrete expression and only uses weak slogans such as "enduring pain" and "calming down" to suppress public opinion. Its intention is nothing more than to fear the violence of the Japanese and dare not lightly seize its edge. What is even more surprising is that at this time of imminent danger, the officials in power do not think about how to survive. They recklessly hope that the powerless and unheroic League of Nations will come out and advocate justice and resolve the matter peacefully. Peace is a good strategy, but it is also a dangerous matter. If the negotiations are successful and we are able to live in peace, then that is fine. If the negotiations are not successful, then they will rely on their violence to coerce us. If we do not prepare for war in advance, the result will not be good. The art of war has always spoken in detail about peace and war, which cannot be neglected. Therefore, abandoning war for peace is difficult to rely on. Preparing for war for peace is durable. We must negotiate for peace on one hand and prepare for war on the other, so that peace can prevail and war can be victorious. Otherwise, if we cannot fight and cannot negotiate, we will inevitably perish. I deeply hope that our wise authorities will pay attention to these words and not rely on peace without using war as a backing, which will be beneficial to the future of the country.</p>
<p>(Reply) This time the Japanese suddenly invaded our Northeast. For the sake of self-defense, we should prepare for a decisive battle on one hand, and hope that the League of Nations, which is known for world peace, will come forward to uphold justice on the other. However, these events are a matter of life and death for our nation, and we must rely entirely on the self-help of our people. I greatly admire your opinion.</p>

<p>Education News Highlights</p>
<h3 id="e106">Zhejiang Education Department Promulgates the Implementation Plan for Anti-Japanese National Salvation in Educational Institutions at All Levels in Zhejiang Province (1) <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The Implementation Plan for Anti-Japanese National Salvation in Educational Institutions at All Levels in Zhejiang Province is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e107">Section for Schools of Class A or Above <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>1.  Regarding Teaching Aspects</p>
<p>"Study without forgetting national salvation," "Save the nation without forgetting study." Amidst this national crisis, all schools should strive for national salvation while intensifying teaching and training. It is imperative to avoid strikes that would sacrifice academic pursuits, and equally important not to neglect national salvation work while focusing solely on studies. Based on this principle, all schools should maintain composure and continue classes as usual. Students must intensify their studies and strictly adhere to school regulations and discipline. In teaching, the following points should be earnestly implemented:</p>
<p>(1) All subjects should take the current Japanese military invasion of our territory as the starting point for teaching, focusing on stimulating students' independent research into the Japan issue and effective methods for resisting Japan and saving the nation. Efforts should be made to link all subjects together. It is best to use the "design-based education method," with the current Japanese atrocities serving as the central unit for designing teaching plans in all subjects.</p>
<p>(2) Add courses on the Japan issue. These courses should be taught for one or two hours daily, outside of the regular curriculum, during the day or evening, by teachers to the entire student body. The content outline for this course is provisionally set as follows: (1) Overview of the international situation after the European War; (2) The Pacific issue and the relations of countries like Britain, America, Japan, and Russia regarding the Pacific issue; (3) The organization and development of the League of Nations; (4) The content and formation of the Kellogg-Briand Pact; (5) A brief history of Sino-Japanese diplomacy (including unequal treaties concluded with Japan throughout history); (6) An overview of Japan's policy of aggression in Manchuria and Mongolia; (7) A general overview of Sino-Japanese international trade in recent years; (8) A general overview of Japan's domestic political and economic situation in recent years; (9) Modern Japanese diplomatic policy; (10) The crisis of the current Japanese atrocities and the Second World War; (11) International relations and attitudes towards this incident; (12) Our country's countermeasures.</p>
<p>(3) In Chinese language courses, attention should be paid to selecting and reading records of Japanese military violence, reports and declarations from the National Government and various party organizations, and opinions or suggestions from the Chinese people regarding this incident, as well as other important documents related to this incident or documents that arouse patriotic and national salvation sentiments. In terms of composition practice, students should be asked to try writing propaganda or opinion papers and plans for resisting Japan and saving the nation. Furthermore, in literature and art, emphasis must be placed on promoting the national spirit and creating a vigorous and brave atmosphere. All romantic, decadent, and weak literature and art should be absolutely prohibited.</p>
<p>(4) Social science subjects such as history and geography should pay special attention to the domestic part of the country and its relationship with Japan. The topography and terrain of the three northeastern provinces and coastal provinces, and their relationship to national defense, should be studied in detail. Other subjects such as political economy should focus on the study of modern international political and economic situations. Educational courses should focus on clarifying the principles of education for national salvation.</p>
<p>(5) Mathematics courses should focus on military surveying, calculating the area of the three northeastern provinces, the number of Japanese troops, statistics on various losses suffered by our country in the three northeastern provinces, and other matters that should be noted in military calculations.</p>
<p>(6) Industrial arts courses such as handicrafts should focus on the structure and application of various military weapons and the practice of digging trenches, the construction of various fortifications, etc. Drawing courses should focus on the anatomical drawing of the structure of military weapons, the drawing of national defense maps, maps of national humiliation, as well as imaginative drawings of the current Japanese military violence and the drawing of anti-Japanese propaganda, etc. Music courses should have students try to compose songs and scores for joining the army and saving the nation, and sing inspiring songs.</p>
<p>(7) Natural science courses should focus on the manufacture of gunpowder, the principles of explosives, the manufacture and application of gas, the manufacture of aircraft, and the structure and application of other new military machinery.</p>
<p>(8) Physical education and hygiene courses should focus on physical fitness and intensified military training. Female students should also pay attention to general medical hygiene and knowledge of nursing and first aid.</p>
<p>2. Regarding Organization and Training Aspects</p>
<p>Under the guidance of local party departments and the government, teachers, staff, students and workers of each school should organize a certain school's anti-Japanese national salvation association to enthusiastically participate in the anti-Japanese national salvation movement. The work can be divided into propaganda, volunteer army training, economic severance, research and design departments. The work outlines and implementation matters of each department are specified separately as follows:</p>
<p>((1)) Propaganda Work Outline</p>
<p>(1) Students of older age and those skilled in speaking should join and organize anti-Japanese national salvation propaganda teams. Each team can be further divided into groups of five to ten people. Until the Japanese army has completely withdrawn from our country's territory, student propaganda teams from each school should take turns to set off to propagate to the public every day. (2) Each group of students setting off for propaganda should be accompanied and guided by at least one teacher. Attention must be paid to the spirit and order during the propaganda. (3) Propaganda materials should be requested from the local party department and provided by teachers. (4) The propaganda locations should be within the location of the school and within a ten-mile radius around the school. Convenient transportation may also be varied as appropriate, but the round trip should be calculated to a maximum of three hours. (5) Students setting off for propaganda must wear school badges and hold self-made anti-Japanese national salvation small flags.</p>
<p>(2) Volunteer Army Training Outline</p>
<p>1. In accordance with the central regulations, the education outline of the volunteer army stipulates that all high schools and above in the province should uniformly organize youth volunteer armies. All junior high schools and below should organize children's volunteer armies, implement military training, swear to believe in the Three Principles of the People, pledge loyalty and bravery, eliminate shame and save the country, assist the government, obey orders, and abide by the following rules: (1) Sacrifice oneself and love the Republic of China to be loyal and brave citizens forever. (2) Obey orders and strictly observe discipline. (3) Develop autonomous habits and implement group life. (4) Help others and serve the public at any time and in any place. (5) Never use Japanese goods for life. 2. Each school implements military training. When necessary, the Education Department shall submit a request to the provincial government for the issuance of guns and ammunition. 3.

<p>Letter to Chairman Chiang: The representatives did not bring luggage, each person only brought two yuan of national currency. If there is no substantial result, they plan not to return to school and brought a letter to Chairman Chiang. The original text is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Presented to the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Chiang: The country is in danger and on the verge of collapse. Please clarify your policy to comfort the people. On the 27th, our association received a telegram from the representatives petitioning in Beijing, stating that you had granted them an audience and addressed their five petitions point by point. All universities in Shanghai were deeply inspired by this good news, but there are still doubts, and we dare to present them to you again. (1) You instructed that if Japan advances further, troops will be sent, and lost land will be recovered. We believe that the purpose of the Japanese invaders is our Northeast. Today, the entire Northeast has fallen into the hands of the Japanese. If the Japanese do not advance further into our country, will you send troops? As for saying that if they advance further, troops will be sent, we do not know to what extent they must advance before troops can be sent. Now Japan is increasing its troops in the Yangtze River and Pearl River basins, and along the coast. Do you think that Japan has advanced further? Also, you instructed that lost land will be recovered, but you did not state how to recover it. Will the Japanese unconditionally return the occupied land to our country, or will the occupied land be recovered by war? This is truly beyond our comprehension, and we should publicly announce it to comfort the people. (2) You instructed that the government is responsible for diplomatic mistakes. We believe that the government is the organ of the state, and the organ must have responsible personnel to function. As for the so-called external mistakes, the government is responsible. Is the Minister of Foreign Affairs responsible, and what kind of responsibility should he bear? If the person responsible is derelict in his duties, how should he be dealt with? Please clarify to appease public anger. (3) You instructed that you have telegraphed Vice Commander Zhang to recover the lost land. According to various newspapers, all of Vice Commander Zhang's troops have been disarmed by the Japanese army. Although the Central Government has sent a telegram instructing him to recover it, Vice Commander Zhang is still using the principle of non-resistance as an excuse, saying that he is incapable of recovering it. How should you deal with this situation? Please clarify to comfort the people. (4) You instructed that university students across the country should be armed, and weapons will be issued when necessary. We believe that the survival of the country is at stake, and our association believes that it is necessary at this time. We do not know if you can fulfill your previous statement and issue weapons. This should be clarified to reassure the people. (5) You instructed that you will not acknowledge the treaties that humiliate the country. We believe that the Northeast has already been occupied by Japan. Why wait to acknowledge the treaties? Before the negotiations are successful, please publicly announce the daily negotiations and the policies taken so that the public can understand them, and earnestly implement revolutionary diplomacy. Do not retreat any further, lest you fail the expectations of the 400 million people. You are the leader of the masses and in charge of the government. In this time of Japanese atrocities and national crisis, we implore you to give further instructions so that the people of the country can follow the anti-Japanese national salvation policy in the future. We are eagerly awaiting your orders. Respectfully presented by the Shanghai University Students Anti-Japanese National Salvation Joint Association.</p>

We regard the violent Japanese invasion of the Eastern Provinces as a hereditary enemy.

<p>The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Joint Association of Shanghai Middle School Students is working hard. The propaganda department of the executive committee had designated propaganda locations for each school the day before, but due to the rain, several schools that were sent to the countryside were unable to set off. Those who were nearby still worked in the rain. Those who did not go to distant places either gave speeches nearby or worked on propaganda materials at school. In the future, the large-scale propaganda will be postponed for three days.</p>

<p>— Juan</p>
<p>Dear compatriots, please stop being self-righteous and talking about being citizens of a great nation. You must know that our international standing is not even as good as that of India, which has been conquered for a long time. Even though Britain has the power of life and death over India, it still does not dare to plunder and massacre the Indian people arbitrarily. However, the Republic of China, which has not yet been conquered, is being plundered and massacred wantonly by the violent Japanese. This is unbearable, and what is not unbearable?</p>

<p>The Dragon Pavilion in Kaifeng is where the Song dynasty held court, and it has now been converted into Zhongshan Park. On the morning of the thirteenth of December in the sixteenth year of the Republic [1927], before dawn, I visited with Cha Mianzhong and saw lines of wild geese flying from Yang Lake, which was a magnificent sight. A poem by Kang Youwei is inscribed on the Dragon Pavilion, which says: "Looking from afar, it is high and cold overlooking Bianzhou: the Iron Pagoda of Fantai floats with the clouds. Ten thousand families have no trees and no palaces; only the rolling Yellow River is seen."</p>
<p>After reading this poem, I stood there in a daze. Mianzhong asked, "What are you looking at?" I said, "I cannot see the Yellow River, let alone its rolling flow."</p>

<p>The new invention of a love message recording. Modern English women are receiving love letters from their sweethearts that they don’t have to read. This is not because the lovers' handwriting is bad or the sentences are incomprehensible, but because love letters can now be written without using a pen. Men only need to send a small record to the woman they love. The woman puts it on a record player and starts it up, and after listening carefully, she will know the details and can hear the lovely voice of her lover. What a joy! Women can also use this method to send love letters to men. This newly invented machine is called Recordavox and is installed in booths that look like public telephone booths on the streets. You only need to put a shilling in the keyhole at the door to open it and enter. Inside, there is a funnel-shaped tube. You can pour all the tender words you want to say into the tube. One shilling allows you to speak for one and a half minutes. If you want to speak longer, you only need to pay another shilling for three minutes. While you are speaking, a diamond needle engraves it on a thin record. When the time is up, the machine will stop automatically, and a small record will be sent out from a crack for you to take away. This machine is not only useful for lovers, but also very convenient for commercial purposes.</p>
<h3 id="e122">The Tragic Situation of Japan's Encroachment on Shenyang <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>— Yun Sun</p>
<p>Japan's encroachment on Shenyang clearly shows that its ambition is not limited to the Northeast. Tanaka Giichi said, "To conquer China, we must first conquer Manchuria and Mongolia, so that the world knows that East Asia is our East Asia and will never dare to invade it." Therefore, trampling on Shenyang is the fuse for annexing our China. On the day of the municipal assembly, I happened to meet a gentleman from Shenyang who had taken refuge in Shanghai. I listened to his tearful words as follows:</p>
<p>This gentleman survived by a narrow escape. Only when he arrived in Tianjin did he feel a little more comfortable in his whole body. However, his confused nerves were still in a state of panic. When the Japanese army entered the city in large numbers, they showed a ferocious and fierce attitude of devouring Chinese people alive. They reeked of alcohol, and those who saw them fled in panic. Innocent children could not be taken away by their parents in time. The Japanese soldiers would often firmly grasp the child's heel with their right hand and forcefully tear the child in half, or dismember the child into four pieces with bayonets. Their ferocity and cruelty are rarely heard of in the world.</p>
<p>If the porters boarded the train and escaped, if they were caught by the Japanese soldiers, they would be dragged down, first whipped, and then cut off with sharp knives. The train station was covered with corpses, which were displayed to the public for three days and then transported out of Shenyang in sacks in an attempt to eliminate traces. However, the Japanese military authorities occupying Shenyang still repeatedly said that Chinese people were forbidden to take a step out of the eastern provinces and could live and work in peace. On the one hand, they instigated the exiled people from their colony, Korea, saying, "You are originally from Manchuria. The Chinese are the ones who invaded your land and killed your ancestors. Now is the time for you to avenge yourselves." The Korean slaves who did not distinguish between kindness and resentment fell into their trap and formed gangs, howling in the important areas of the city and displaying their skills of rape, plunder, and looting. According to what I know, the students from Shenyang who are staying in Shanghai have not received news from their hometown for a long time, and they dare not even think about returning home. They tearfully told people, "Although our country has not been completely destroyed, our home has been destroyed first." This is something that could not have been foreseen at the time of parting.</p>
<p>I often fantasize about the strength we can have. That is to boycott Japanese goods. I have another suggestion. For example, thirty years ago, there was no official or nobleman who did not eat opium. At that time, the world also believed that not being a part of the opium addict group meant not being able to hold an important position. What has changed today? I am afraid that if we say it the other way around, if the people of the country regard using Japanese goods and selling Japanese goods as something that is despised by society, and if we are of one mind and persevere, the results will be great. I hope that the people of the country will act in good conscience and take action quickly.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Alarm Bell <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>

<p>This time the Japanese soldiers occupied Shenyang, insulting us to the extreme. I advise all merchants across the country to vow not to import Japanese goods. If all the people of the country unanimously refuse to use Japanese goods, then the Japanese goods purchased by the merchants may turn into losing goods. I hope they will wake up quickly. (Reply)</p>
<h3 id="e124">An Analysis of Japanese Psychology <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>— Chi Fo</p>
<p>Although Japan is a country of the same race as us, their psychology is completely different from that of our people. Our people are very much like the children of bankrupt households, engaging in reckless prostitution and gambling, only knowing how to satisfy their personal desires, stubbornly resisting enlightenment, and being exploited by local bullies and scoundrels, sucking their blood and salting their brains, and still thinking that they can live a peaceful life. The Japanese are very much like local bullies and scoundrels, cunning and greedy, only interested in profit. Now that they see that the children of the bankrupt households are somewhat enlightened and have taken some action, they stop at nothing and turn against them, pulling out their fists and punching them. Alas, if we had not been self-destructive and self-abandoning in the past, how could we have come to this day of suffering? As the saying goes, "Short people have long guts." This can be said to be an accurate psychological test of the Japanese. Look at Japanese men, with a small mustache on their lips and sharp eyes, aren't they insidious faces? When they do business, they are very humble, which is really different from the shop assistants in Shanghai. You say they are polite, but in fact, the short people have their own plans and are trying to cheat the Chinese people out of their money. It is a pity that the Chinese people are greedy for small gains, and Japanese goods have already dominated their economic world. This time, Japan's invasion of the eastern provinces is extremely ferocious and evil. I advise the Chinese people not to be greedy for small gains anymore. Quickly switch to using domestic goods. With everyone united, we can kill them. Everyone should engrave this idea in their hearts, not just promote it verbally. The Buddha said, "Everything is made by the mind," which is indeed the ultimate truth. If you don't believe it, look at Gandhi. The ancients said, "Even though Chu has only three households, it will surely destroy Qin." The power of this word "mind" is very great. I hope that every Chinese person has a mind. Although Japan is strong, there will be a day... I don't have the time to write a long article, but I can talk about it in Free Talk. Although Japanese women don't care much about the issue of chastity, their patriotism is no less than that of men. A woman gave her son pears and lychees to eat. The son ate them very happily. The woman said, "These pears are from Tianjin, China, and these lychees are from Guangdong, China. If you like pears and lychees, you can think of Tianjin and Guangdong, China. China is a good place. The Chinese people are a self-destructive and self-abandoning people. You can make some contributions to the country in the future." Alas, what is the psychology of the Japanese? What is Japanese early childhood education like? Shouldn't we be chilled to the bone? The Japanese also like to gamble very much, so up...</p>
<h3 id="e125">Participating in the Capital Citizens' Anti-Japanese National Salvation Congress <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Ming</p>
<p>On the morning of September 23rd, the citizens of the capital held an Anti-Japanese National Salvation Congress at the public stadium at 9:00 AM. Around 7:00 AM, I took a triangular paper flag with "Down with Japan" written on it and walked to participate. Several dozen steps before reaching Fucheng Bridge, I encountered a team of female students, all holding flags in their right hands, wearing white clothes, black skirts, bare legs, and yellow shoes. I walked alongside them and caught up with the front of the team. Only then did I realize that they were from the National Revolutionary Army Veterans' Girls' School, two people in a row. The atmosphere of grief and indignation was evident on their faces. I carefully looked at the flags they were holding, which mostly read "Down with Japanese Imperialism." The teachers' flags read "No More Five Minutes," "Better to Be a Broken Jade than a Whole Tile," and "Rise Up to Save the Country, Sacrifice Yourself in the Face of Disaster." One male teacher held a flag that read "Either Japan or Me, Either Me or Japan." A tall and healthy senior female student with a tragic attitude held a flag that read "Kill to Tokyo, Drink the Blood of the Wornu (Japanese)." Her great ambition and passionate patriotism were fully expressed. The descendants and orphans of the martyrs of the Party and the country are indeed extraordinary. When they reached the front of the Supervisory Yuan, the female student team suddenly stopped. Then, they saw the leader giving each person a piece of black gauze, which they immediately wrapped around their arms and continued on. They entered the public stadium. A team of Boy Scouts stood in front of the stadium, and military police were scattered around to maintain order. Inside the gate, there were two rows of long tables on both sides. The tables were filled with registration books, which were divided into departments for the Party, academia, agriculture, industry, commerce, military, government, citizens, and civic groups. After signing in and claiming pamphlets, I entered and surveyed the scene. The meeting hall was in the north, and the chairman's platform was covered with Party and national flags. The south was connected to the command platform by countless small flags.</p>
<p>It was still early. The masses participating in the congress entered through the gate in an endless stream. The sound of loudspeakers and shouts could be heard intermittently. Boy Scouts were scattered throughout the stadium. Behind the chairman's platform was the First Park. Dozens of weeping willows hung upside down, as if they were also drooping their heads in mourning. After the meeting began, I looked around and saw that the vast and boundless stadium was already a sea of people. Only hundreds of thousands of flags could be seen fluttering in the wind.</p>
<p>The elderly chairman reported anxiously. After the meeting began as scheduled, the congress presidium unanimously elected Zhou Bomin as chairman. He reported the reasons for the meeting and read the proposals aloud. However, he was interrupted several times due to coughing. Some said that this old man coughed because he hated the Japanese. Later, a citizen proposed in a loud voice that another person be asked to read it. The chairman ignored him. After a while, another person requested, and he finally agreed. This old man is getting stronger with age, which is a model for future generations.</p>
<p>Tang Guozhen spoke with tears. During the speech, Ms. Tang Guozhen, a representative of the Women's Relief Association, was natural in her attitude and clear in her speech. Her words were especially generous and passionate. She said, "I hope the government will declare war on Japan and that the masses will be ghosts under the knife and not slaves of a conquered country." She was willing to sacrifice her blood to the cause. When she spoke of the people of the country being displaced and homeless, and Japan taking the opportunity to wreak havoc, and of the past tragic cases, she sobbed in pain. She cried and spoke. Finally, she said, "I hope that the women in the audience will initiate the organization of a Women's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Suicide Squad to participate in the actual combat and not lag behind the men." After she finished speaking, she repeatedly wiped her tears with a towel.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese comrades were heartbroken. Zheng Luosheng, a representative of the overseas Chinese, was an elderly man. When he spoke to the point of heartbreak, he brought out the Malay language, which was incomprehensible. However, everyone silently acknowledged that he was an enthusiastic patriot.</p>
<p>Northeast representatives wailed. Next was Feng Zhaoyi, a representative of the Northeast Compatriots Association in Beijing, who spoke. First, he briefly reported on the tragic situation in the Northeast, and then he wailed loudly, "The Northeast is gone, the Northeast is gone!" and withdrew. According to my analysis, people with tears but no sound are said to be weeping, people with tears and sound are said to be crying, and people with sound but no tears are said to be howling. Howling is an expression of extreme heartbreak. This gentleman was probably extremely heartbroken.</p>
<p>Little brother wants to defeat Japan. After the proposals were passed, the command section directed the formation of a parade to Dachong Bridge. They encountered two male and female elementary school students, about six or seven years old. The female student was already holding three or four flags high. The male student suddenly came in front of me and asked for a flag. I left the team and asked him why, and asked him what was written on the flag. The male student reached out and took the flag and pointed to the words on the flag and said, "Want... to defeat Japan." Hiss. The anti-Japanese atmosphere has been deeply imprinted in the minds of the little brother.</p>
<p>President Yu gave a speech on behalf of the central government. Then, passing through Huaiqing Bridge, Yaojia Lane, Confucius Temple, Sixiang Bridge, Taiping Road, Yanggong Well, Erlang Temple, and Beiting Lane, we turned to Guofu Road. Slogans filled the eyes along the way, and national flags fluttered, but they were all at half-mast. The procession was four people in a row, and the order was neat. When they arrived at the National Government to petition, they first sang the Party song in front of the National Government. Then, the representatives of the presidium entered to petition for a declaration of war on Japan. President Yu Youren came out on behalf of the central government. President Yu stood on a wooden bench in front of the gate of the National Government and gave a speech. He said, "The government will do its best to meet the people's petition today and save the country together. This is my intention on behalf of the government, and it is also my response to all compatriots. I hope that this joint effort to save the country will be a courageous and decisive struggle to achieve success."</p>
<p>Then, amidst the shouting of slogans, the crowd went out to Zhongshan Road and dispersed to return. I returned and wrote this down to inform the people of the country.</p>
<p>In the Shanghai racetrack, their footprints can often be found. A certain school in this city run by the Japanese openly plays mahjong, but it is only for entertainment and not for gambling with money. This is very different from the psychology of our people.</p>
<p>Statement In yesterday's "Words of Heartache," the second line was missing the word "me" after the word "pan." We hereby declare this.</p>

<p>— Jiang Hongjiao</p>
<p>"Then if I try to persuade you to stay, would you still leave?" Mr. Chen was really unable to restrain himself and said what he wanted to say in his heart frankly.</p>
<p>"...But the current environment forces me to leave, and I have no choice but to leave. Perhaps we will have a chance to meet again. I don't know when your wife will be back tonight. If I can't meet her, please give her a message for me, saying that I can't say goodbye to her." Madam Li was silent at first, but later said sadly. She gradually lowered her head into her arms, and her voice was choked with sobs. Mr. Chen couldn't tell if she was crying.</p>
<p>"The rumors outside are just rumors. We can ask our conscience. Do we have anything to be ashamed of? Why should we be so angry? I think your life is very hard, and you definitely can't resign. Let me resign and leave Shanghai. I have a friend who is the general manager of a bank in Tianjin. When he left, I... We were supposed to go together, but I'm telling you the truth, I didn't go because I couldn't bear to leave Shanghai. If I go to him now, I can definitely find a suitable job. Please don't leave. Let me go!"</p>
<p>"I'm just a woman, and reputation and status don't matter. You are a man, and you are still young, but your children are already grown up. Your burden is so heavy. What if you are affected by these rumors? How can I face you? Alas! In short, the opportunity for us to meet came too late. Everything else is nonsense."</p>
<p>"What does Mr. Li think about you going to Hangzhou?"</p>
<p>"Him? He hasn't expressed anything to me. It's as if the two of us have no relationship at all. Think about it, what's the point of such a family? If it were someone with a slightly weaker will, they would have committed suicide long ago. The night before yesterday, when he came home, he openly calculated a bill from the wood company there. I asked him, 'What are you buying these expensive wooden items for?' He replied, 'Don't worry about it.' I asked him again, 'What are you going to do with me?' He said again, 'You can rest assured that I will never divorce you. You have to eat your meal quietly. If you had a personality like Mr. Chen, I would love you.' Think about his words, how hateful they are! I really can't do anything about him. If I file for divorce, the rumors outside will definitely be associated with it, causing you to suffer injustice. Fortunately, your wife doesn't go out often and is very good to you. She can always not suspect that we have anything... ambiguous, otherwise I would have no way to defend myself to her. In the past, I still begged you to find out about the woman in the car for me, but now I've given up on that idea, because listening to your words, I really know everything. Not only is there no way to resist him, but it only increases my troubles. Now that he's buying a lot of wooden items, isn't it to rent a house with that woman?"</p>

<h3 id="e127">Gold Market Fluctuations Still Severe <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Resulting in a Drop of Thirteen and a Half Taels</p>
<p>The Situation is Extremely Complicated. Yesterday, the 28th, the gold price started sharp but turned sluggish, and there were still drastic changes. The angry tides and huge waves were beyond control. It was not unusual to see fluctuations of three or four taels to ten taels at any moment. The overall market had a difference of nearly thirty taels, and the result was another drop of thirteen or fourteen taels. People were extremely anxious. The supply and demand in the market varied, but there were no large transactions, mainly because the risk was too high. The overseas silver market suddenly rose and fell, and there were many reversals. However, the overall silver bar still rose in the past two days, while American silver fell instead. As a result, it was expected to reach a peak in the morning, and it once exceeded the 700 tael mark. However, the selling pressure was too strong. In addition, the exchange rate was loosening, the domestic market was tightening, and the British, American, and Japanese markets were all trending toward loosening. Moreover, because the Japanese pirates were still fierce, the intentions of the industry were quite timid, and the bulls were ultimately unable to be optimistic. The market price has now fallen sharply by more than twenty taels. The future market is even weaker. The buying price of the Bank of England gold is approaching one shilling and seven pence and a half, and the atmosphere is deteriorating, and rumors are rampant. It is said that it will continue to fall by ten taels.</p>
<p>A Brief Show of Strength in the Morning. The market opened slightly lower by one tael at 688 taels for the November contract. However, the large silver bar rose sharply by 3 pence 625 on the 26th, and the silver price rose by 1 cent 875. On the 27th, it suddenly fell back by 3 pence 125, and the silver price even shrank by 2 cents 25. The overall silver bar still shrank by 375. As a result, buyers were like clouds, and Dachen, Xiekang, Yuanheng, and others all entered the market. As a result, the bulls turned from worry to joy, while the bears showed terror, which was incredible. It immediately soared by more than ten taels, reaching 702 taels. However, the bulls sold some, and it plunged ten taels to 692 taels. Unexpectedly, British gold tended to rise, and it was diligent. November was 1.6625. HSBC absorbed 625, and then only settled at 1.65625. Furthermore, the buyers were even stronger, jumping ten taels, reaching 703 taels at 9:15. In an instant, Fuyu, Yuancheng, Yongcheng, Fengyong, and others came to sell for hedging, and the price was difficult to support due to the poor situation. It fell by about ten taels. The telegraphic transfer rate was announced as 695.6 taels, the listed price increased by 25, the US dollar also increased by 50 cents, and the Japanese gold fell slightly by 2 and a half cents, and immediately fell to 88 taels. Retail investors purchased, and it became 93 taels. Zhifengyong, Tong Taichang, Wanxing, and others sold, and Zhengjin and Sumitomo issued November British gold 1.68125. After 10:00, it was 85 taels. Then, Zhengjin absorbed US$31.875 and purchased Japanese-US exchange rate of 49.1875, which suddenly rose by six or seven taels to 92 taels. In an instant, the sellers were excited, and the December British gold could be settled at 1.6875. Furthermore, Japanese-US only did 49 yuan, so at 10:30, it was 81 taels and 3 qian. At 11:00, it was 85 and a half taels, and in an instant, it fell again. Mitsubishi issued forward British gold at 1.7125, and because of rumors that a certain important person was insulted, people were even more afraid. At 11:15, it suddenly became 77 taels and 5 qian. Afterwards, HSBC and others absorbed November US dollars at 32.125 yuan, and the retail shorts made up their positions, so it has been pulled up six or seven taels. However, there was a two or three tael spread. By noon, it closed at 84 taels and 2 qian, and continued to do up to 4 taels. The announced price was changed to 831 taels before and after, with a total of 140 taels or so, then 152 or 3 taels, and 146 taels at noon.</p>
<p>The Atmosphere in the Future Market Deteriorates. The afternoon market opened at 86 taels, then from 84 taels to 86 and a half taels. Then, due to Daxing's selling, it lost six or seven taels to 79 taels 5. Before long, Dalian Bang and Yifeng and others bought in, adding to 82 and a half taels. However, Zhengjin issued January British gold at 1.725. Later, HSBC bought December at 4.375. Yuanmao Yongshunli and others came to sell, and the atmosphere was even more dangerous, falling again by more than eight taels. After 2:30, it was 74 taels. It was heard that HSBC ate 1.7375. After 2:45, it was 80 taels, but the mood was not good. Zhengjin suddenly issued December at 1.7375 again. At 3:00, it was 75 and a half taels. At that time, 375 was not easy to close, so it added 3 taels to 78 and a half taels. Soon after, the banks did US dollars at 32.25 yuan. General retail investors sold off. At 4:00, it was 74 taels. After this, it seemed peaceful, but there were only two taels of ups and downs. By the close, it was 75 and a half taels, a drop of 13 and a half taels compared to the 25th (before the market closed). After the close, it did up to 76 taels. According to the maximum of 703 taels and the minimum of 674 taels in one day, the difference was 29 taels. The physical goods market was 96 taels in the morning, 84 taels at noon, 85 taels in the afternoon, and 76 taels at the close. The announced price was 145 taels to 156 or 7 taels, and finally 155 taels. The registered replenishment price was 84 taels in the morning and 76 taels in the afternoon. The current red bar was plus 11 taels. The market situation was normal, and customer sales were still lacking, but Yingfeng Heng and others made some progress.</p>
<p>The Inflow and Outflow are Extremely Chaotic. The over-the-counter transactions were complex. According to statistics, Dachen, Xiekang, Yuancheng, Shunli, Yongde, physical goods, etc. bought in. Wanxing, Tong Taichang, Qianchangxiang, Zhifengyong, and Yuanmao Yong sold more and bought less. Yuandayong, Yuanxingyong, and Chengfengyong all sold. Yuantai, Yuanchun, Fuchang, Yuanheng, Futaiheng, etc. had a lot of inflows and outflows. In the afternoon, Hengxing, Yuanmao Yong, and Wanxing all sold. Shunli, Zhifengyong, and Dachen bought in. Draft hedging all sold, and the hedging of British gold also sold. However, those who sold Japanese gold bought in. Dalian Gang sold a total of 1,6700 taels and bought more than 2,000 taels. Speculators had few inflows and outflows. Guangbang sold 5600 taels.</p>
<h3 id="e128">No Change in British Silver <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>国民社（Guomin News Agency） reported from London on the 28th that there was no change in the big bar. The spot price was still 16 pence 375, and the forward price continued to be 16 pence 5625.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Foreign Exchange: Initially Firm, Then Weak <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Quotation Raised by One Notch</p>
<p>Since last Saturday (the 26th), the British and American banking markets had robust gains, but by the next day, they suddenly retreated. Over two days, British silver still managed to rise by half a penny, reaching 56.25. American silver, however, shrank by 3.75. The market situation is volatile and unpredictable. The exchange rates, however, were small. The Japanese and American rates trended upward. When HSBC posted its rates, it raised the quotation by one notch yesterday. British gold was quoted at 25, equivalent to one shilling and six pence. American gold was raised by five cents, quoted at 28.625 yuan. Japanese gold fell by 2.5 fen, quoted at one tael, seven qian, and 2.5 fen. Other rates also generally rose, except for German exchange, which decreased by 0.25, quoted at 121 yuan. The Hong Kong rate suddenly changed, quoted at 78 taels. The internal market trend was complex, initially appearing firm, then weakening, especially in the afternoon. The result was that, compared to the 25th, British gold increased by 0.625, American gold by one yuan, and Japanese gold decreased by 0.06. The gold price turned from firm to weak, with a difference of about 30 taels. Chinese merchants in the gold industry mostly covered their short positions with British gold to offset previous losses, effectively selling gold. However, the profit was considerable. The hedge covered about 74 or 75 taels, with a turnover of about 300,000 pounds. As for silver prices, Japanese merchants were mostly selling, while remittance hopes were slightly buying. In addition, American dollars worth 300,000 to 400,000 yuan were sold by various firms, along with over one million in Japanese gold. Regarding Japanese-American exchange, Zhengjin bought December at 49.1875 yuan in the morning and also traded with Taiwan at 49 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e130">Money Market Suddenly Tightens Again <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Call Loan Rate Soars to a New High of Five Cents</p>
<p>Market Overview: The money market has been very tight in recent days due to various influences. The situation was further strained by the year-end settlement a few days ago. Yesterday morning, the situation became even tighter, with the call loan rate reaching a new high. By the afternoon, it was reported that banks on the Bund had loans available, and the situation eased slightly. However, the capital base of Chinese merchants remained insufficient, and a small number of unpatriotic wealthy households transferred their deposits from Chinese banks to enemy banks, further depleting the financial resources. Fortunately, due to the seasonal nature of the business, most operations have reduced their scope. Therefore, large-scale transactions seem to be coming to an end. Overall, there is unlikely to be any major danger. As for foreign interest rates, they have already fallen back to below normal levels, so there is no problem.</p>
<p>Interest Rate Prices: (Foreign Interest) The morning interest rate was slightly better than the previous morning by 0.375 hao, at 0.724625 yuan. The afternoon interest rate fell back to 0.724 yuan, the same as the previous day's morning rate, showing a stable situation. (Silver Call Loan) The morning call loan rate was even higher due to the extreme shortage of funds, reaching a new high of five cents, unseen this year. In the afternoon, the situation eased slightly due to reports of bank loans being released. The closing call loan rate was four cents, with a markup of only 0.256. The bank's listed rate was two cents.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market Conditions: Jiangnan small silver coins, after rising once the day before yesterday, immediately fell back. Yesterday, the morning and afternoon markets both saw transactions at 0.6605 yuan. The morning market saw 5,000 jiao traded, and the afternoon market saw 3,000 jiao traded. Guangdong small silver coins were slightly tighter. The morning market was 0.60225 yuan, and the afternoon market was 0.6053 yuan. The morning market saw 160,000 jiao traded, and the afternoon market saw 90,000 jiao traded. Copper coins increased by another 1,000 wen, to 375,000.</p>
<p>Silver Coin Inflow and Outflow: (Silver Funds) Yesterday was Monday, and because of the two-day closure, the receipt and disbursement situation was particularly busy. Moreover, with the end of the month approaching, settlements were frequent. Various ports, aware of the tight money market in Shanghai, sent remittances to Shanghai, along with various special remittances. Therefore, the banks faced unusually troublesome procedures and could not accurately calculate the usual receipt and disbursement information. According to rough estimates, the total amount was over 20 million. However, the banks made over 2 million in loans, remittances from various ports totaled over 1 million, receipts from money shops and silver guilds totaled over 5.1 million, receipts from Liu Tou totaled over 5.7 million, remittances from various routes totaled over 800,000, and cash receipts totaled over 1 million. (Foreign Funds) Remittance drafts totaled 2.4005 million in the morning market and 1.684 million in the afternoon market. Banknotes totaled 165,000 in the morning market and 80,000 in the afternoon market. Off-market banknotes totaled 220,000 in the morning market and 185,000 in the afternoon market. Bank trading totaled 1.3 million in the morning interbank market and 800,000 in the afternoon market. Receipts and disbursements between foreign accounts of various banks totaled over 2.3 million. Banknote inflow and outflow totaled over 1 million. Receipts from money shops and foreign public units totaled over 8.3 million. Receipts from foreign remittance headers totaled over 3.2 million. Interbank lending of foreign funds totaled over 2.2 million. Small money shop transactions totaled over 600,000. Sources from other ports totaled over 400,000.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Yarn and Cotton Yarn Market: Buying Interest Remains Strong <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Impact of Domestic Yarn Supply Falling Short</p>
<p>The yarn market trend is particularly firm. Due to the intense anti-Japanese movement, Japanese yarn cannot circulate. Domestic yarn is in short supply, causing it to become increasingly tight. Speculators flock to buy, causing the market to rise. Despite the tight money market, buyers remain enthusiastic, and sales of spot yarn are still developing.</p>
<p>Man-Mark Yarn Rises Two to Three Taels: The opening market for Man-Mark yarn was flat, but later, due to a lack of sellers, all months rose by one tael and 0.24 qian.

<h3 id="e132">Cotton Market: Difficult to Recover from Accumulated Problems <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Foreign Cotton Trend Weak... Mills Increasingly Stagnant</p>
<p>The cotton market is very weak, with a softening trend. Due to the heavy burden of American cotton, sentiment is weak. Foreign cotton prices are very cheap, and transactions at domestic cotton mills are scarce. Hankou guilds and cotton merchants are still mostly long, but the global situation is very pessimistic, so the market cannot recover.</p>
<p>Hankou-Mark Falls Sharply, Recovers Slightly: At the exchange, Hankou-Mark opened lower due to the foreign exchange increase and poor performance of American cotton. All months fell by 0.05 or 0.06 qian. Later, some short covering caused a slight rise. Ultimately, all months fell by 0.03 or 0.04 qian. In the afternoon, due to rain, all months recovered by 0.005 to 0.03 qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 100,280 dan. Gong Tai sold 6,100 dan, Mei Ji 2,000 dan, Heng Yi 2,400 dan, Tian Long 3,100 dan, Yi Cheng 2,800 dan, and Li Chang 3,500 dan. Yu Da bought 3,800 dan, Ji Feng 3,800 dan, Chang He 4,800 dan, Da Fu 2,700 dan, and Yuan De 2,200 dan. The closing prices are recorded below.</p>

<h3 id="e134">Indian and English Cotton Spot Sales Active <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Bombay: The futures market situation last week was unstable. Speculators were very excited due to conflicting rumors about Robi's future prices and bank closures. However, the government emphasized the stability of India's finances, so the trend remained firm. In terms of spot goods, trading was good at the beginning of the week. Japanese exporters inquired about Aumra, Shanghai exporters bought Bai Luoxi, and Liverpool merchants showed interest, especially in Benjie and Central Provinces cotton. The statistics for last week are appended below (unit: 1,000 bales).</p>
<p>1930, 1931</p>
<p>Accumulated Receipts Since September 1st: 42, 28</p>
<p>Weekend Inventory: 567, 583</p>
<p>Accumulated Exports Since September 1st: 160, 67</p>
<p>Shipped to Europe: 38, 14</p>
<p>Shipped to China: 33, 22</p>
<p>Shipped to Japan: 88, 26</p>
<p>Other Regions: 1, 5</p>
<p>Liverpool: Spot sales were active last week, and market prices rose. In terms of futures, prices rose sharply due to the suspension of the gold standard. Dealers and local merchants bought in large quantities, and short positions were also covered. Afterward, the market became even more active. The Egyptian cotton market also saw activity.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Grain, River Water, and Rice Market Turn Loose <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Nantou: Yesterday, over 30 ships arrived from various guilds. City and rural shop sales were limited, even though the Mid-Autumn Festival had passed, due to diplomatic tensions, financial urgency, and the arrival of new goods from various places. Sellers wanted to hold on but found it difficult, so the price of thick broken japonica rice fell by 0.10 or 0.20 yuan, and thin broken rice followed suit by 0.10 yuan. However, appetite remained stagnant, and actual sales were poor. Under these circumstances, it is difficult for the market to flourish. There is little inventory of aged Lu Yang tip, and it also followed the price decline. Transactions in discolored yuan were sluggish, and the trend is also weakening. New japonica rice and new Lu Yang tip arrived and were sold in small quantities, cutting the price by 0.10 or 0.20 yuan. There is not much inventory of water chestnut tips, and appetite is also sluggish, following the price decline by 0.10 or 0.20 yuan. The original reason is the relationship between the situation and finance, coupled with foreign firms dumping large quantities of foreign rice futures. Moreover, about 500,000 bags are expected to arrive this month. Furthermore, customer sales are limited, relying only on this street, which is also limited.</p>
<p>Xinzha: Yesterday was rainy, and the rice market did not improve. The opening market in the morning saw prices of all goods fall. There were not many arrivals from the west, and people's minds were relaxed. Dongxi new japonica rice and new Yang Lu tip were short by 0.20 yuan each. Thick and thin broken japonica rice, early and late rice, etc., showed no spirit. Only the new customer tip arrivals were limited, and rural village guilds had some sales channels, showing a downward trend.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Foreign Rice Futures Suddenly Rise by 0.015 Yuan <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot market for foreign rice was flat, and prices remained soft. Futures prices from the production areas rose by 20%, and foreign firms' asking prices increased by 0.02 yuan, no longer pushing sales as much as last week. Distant futures were even more popular, with 1,000 qing of February/March futures sold, priced at 5.805 taels, up 0.0155 yuan from last week. 400 tons of October futures were offered, priced at 5.45 taels. Only 1,000 bags of spot goods were offered, priced at 11.92 to 11.82 yuan. Lixin Foreign Firm telegraphed 500 tons of No. 1 Saigon cargo for November shipment, priced at 6.20 taels.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Flour Prices Fall Consistently and Severely <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Cheap Russian Wheat is a Major Factor</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening market in the morning and afternoon, all months of the flour market showed a consistent and sharp decline. Since the Japanese atrocities, sales in the three northeastern provinces have been blocked, and the financial situation has also tightened step by step. Moreover, the country is still in turmoil, so most of the bulls dare not stay in the market and are closing their positions step by step. Furthermore, a major factory is said to have abandoned its prejudices and is unwilling to maintain the market, so the bulls' background is even more pessimistic. As for the world's wheat market, it is still silent, and the sale of Russian wheat is becoming more vigorous. Since the first batch of 3.80 taels was traded, it has continued to fall. The latest price is said to have fallen to 3.55 taels. If this dumping continues, it will be difficult for the Chinese market to return to its old state. The loose market atmosphere seems to have a huge cause and effect. As a result, this month fell by 0.0275 yuan compared to the previous weekend, October fell by 0.0275 yuan, November fell by 0.03 yuan, November/December fell by 0.02 yuan, and February fell by 0.0175 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Wheat Futures Continue to Fall <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Recent Months Fall by Over 0.01 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening market in the morning and afternoon, all months of the wheat futures market showed a sharp decline. The conclusion of the last month was such a severe fall, and the recent Russian wheat atmosphere is very loose, falling another 0.02 yuan compared to the first batch price, pushing the market down step by step. The Shanghai market is inevitably facing a price war. The current predicament is due to the factories having very large inventories and being unwilling to inquire about market funds. The shorts all have physical goods, and the longs have no producers to support them. With this one factor, it is difficult for the market to hold up. Moreover, all kinds of facts are unfavorable to the longs. Therefore, the inland Yangtze River area no longer dares to push up the market and is seeking to escape. The continued fall of the market is not without reason. As a result, October/November fell by 0.011 yuan each compared to the previous week, December fell by 0.008 yuan, January fell by 0.007 yuan, and February fell by 0.006 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the trading of metals was even quieter due to the influence of the pouring autumn rain. Business from northern and southern customers was deserted, and local factories also bought very little. Therefore, the trading volume of various goods in the city was very small. However, the excessively loose overseas exchange market caused the prices of several types of goods in this port to decline significantly. Fortunately, overseas prices continue to rise, and people's confidence in this port is slightly firmer, so there is no major price drop on the surface.</p>

<p>Over 10,000 dan of new and old iron products arrived yesterday at the New Taikoo warehouses. At a time when the country is in turmoil and sales are sluggish, this has a significant impact on the future of the market.</p>

<p>Loss of 3 Taels Per Dan</p>
<p>The first batch of new Xinhua rounds, transported from the origin, totaled over 6,000 boxes, with over 4,000 boxes to Ningbo and only 2,000 to Shanghai. Yesterday, the goods arrived, and various firms agreed that the standard Jiechun Zheng Er would be sold at 99 taels, with other brands discounted accordingly. However, the cost is 102 taels, and the price is less than 100 taels, resulting in a loss of 3 taels per dan.</p>

<p>Coarse Sand White Also Turns Firm</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were no telegrams from the production areas in the general market. Transactions of Liu Pan He sugar No. 24 coarse sand white in the guild market remained quiet. However, due to rumors that Java company's freight rates would increase, sentiment was slightly firmer, and price reductions turned into price increases. New goods were traded at 11.40 taels, high-quality goods at 11.45 taels, No. 20 medium sand white at 10.09 taels, and No. 8 Dutch red at 9.25 taels. The market remained firm. Taikoo sugar trading was active, and market prices therefore increased. B mark 12.05 taels, the market then called for 12.10 taels, DY mark 10 taels, HX mark 11.95 taels, HM mark 11.45 taels, 11.4625 taels, and even rose to 11.50 taels, and the market situation was quite attractive. Given the company's tight factory market and thin inventory, it seems to have the potential for a gradual increase.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the silk market in Shanghai was increasingly deserted due to dramatic changes in the exchange market and economic instability overseas, with silk sales almost at a standstill. European and American silk telegrams did not turn yesterday, and the market atmosphere was quiet. Yesterday, only Hangzhou Silk Factory purchased five bales of white factory warp, and Boxin purchased six bales of yellow drawn warp, both at flat prices.</p>

<p>Japanese Merchants Rely on American Sales as their Main Outlet... Over 40,000 Bales Reached this Month</p>
<p>Since Japan had a bumper autumn cocoon harvest, silk production was surplus. China has implemented an economic boycott against Japan, and Japanese cocoons can no longer be transported to China. Japanese silk merchants can only promote sales in Europe and the United States. Since American silk merchants have focused on reducing costs, Japanese silk has become increasingly competitive in the United States. Shipments to the United States are strong. This month, Japanese silk shipments to New York reached 41,375 bales, indicating that Japanese silk relies on American sales as its main outlet.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Tunxi Zhenmei English Sales Slightly Move <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the Shanghai foreign tea market, Jilong Foreign Firm, an English firm, resumed purchasing Tunxi high-grade Zhenmei green tea. Over 600 boxes were sold in the city, priced at over 110 taels, 0.10 taels lower than before. The Zhenmei item, since the outbreak of Japanese aggression against China, and then the suspension of the gold standard in Britain, the market has been lifeless. Fortunately, this year's output is scarce, and supply actually falls short of demand. It seems that the market's inventory will not be difficult to sell out within the year.</p>

<h3 id="e146">Sunday Literature: East Monarch <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Special Issue on World Women Writers</p>
<p>The Sunday Literature, edited by Tang Zengyang, has been popular nationwide since its publication. Famous writers and literary youth are scrambling to buy and read it, because this literary weekly is concise and insightful. At the same time, this weekly is most suitable for the conditions of "journalistic literature."</p>
<p>Since the publication of "Students of the Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts to Mr. Zhu Yingpeng" in the recent ninth issue, it has attracted more attention from the art world and the publishing industry, no, it has attracted the attention of the entire society. Everyone is willing to see what is going on.</p>
<p>The content of this issue is even richer than before. Like the passage of days, this weekly is evolving step by step, moving step by step towards a perfect and bright path. This issue is the "Special Issue on World Women Writers," which has attracted even more attention from the literary world, because everyone is interested in knowing something about the lives and works of the latest world women writers.</p>
<p>I will now introduce the contents of this issue as follows. The first article is "Ms. Bing Xin's 'Returning South'" by Mr. Zhao Jingshen, a famous figure in our translation circles. Those who have read this type of writing by Mr. Zhao will definitely know that Mr. Zhao's writing style is light and tactful. This article, a reading of "Returning South," is even more light and lyrical, and at the same time contains poetic interest.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhao's article—</p>
<p>"Returning South is only a novella of more than 20,000 words, but this is Ms. Bing Xin's longest work. It is more appropriate to call it a memoir than a novel, to show more respect to the author. She is not entertaining us with fictional facts, but offering us her sincere daughter's heart with enthusiasm. On the one hand, she is painfully recalling her dead mother, and on the other hand, she wants to share a sense of sacred communion with those who sympathize with her or have the same experience. This is writing of the highest emotion and nature, although the whole article is only a record of her mother's death and the signs of her mother's illness before death."</p>
<p>How touching this passage is written! At the same time, Mr. Zhao's criticism of "Returning South" as a memoir is even more insightful. Secondly, Yang Changxi's introduction to the contemporary French female writer Colette is a very interesting piece of writing. Anyone who has read Ms. Colette's "Purple Love" needs to know more about her artistic life: how she became a dancer, how boldly she described the actual lives of women, and how she married that noble, musical genius, and symbolist poet.</p>
<p>Mao Yibo's "Indian Female Poet Naidu" is also a very exquisite piece of writing. The lyrical poetry of the female poet Naidu has already attracted the attention of writers from all walks of life. Her national movement has also aroused the admiration and respect of people all over the world. After reading Mr. Mao's article, we can learn more about Ms. Naidu's life and become a topic of excitement in the literary world.</p>
<p>Ni Yide's "Modern Female Painter" is an article introducing the life and works of Mrs. Roland Sean. Roland Sean is a typical modern woman and a typical modern artist. She is a painter of the Fauvist school. After reading Mr. Ni's article, we can learn all about Roland Sean's style.</p>
<p>Mr. Cui Wanqiu's "Interview with Fumiko Hayashi" is a very interesting interview. Fumiko Hayashi is a prominent new female writer in the Japanese literary world. A part of her works has been translated into Chinese by Mr. Cui. After reading this humorous text by Mr. Cui, we can learn more about what kind of romantic and lively young woman Ms. Hayashi is.</p>
<p>In addition, there is an illustration of Roland Sean's "Girl Playing the Violin," as well as recent news about Ms. Wu Sihong, the wife of the late proletarian writer Jiang Guangci. In the era of the rise of nationalist literature, it is even more interesting to see the actions of the declining figures of the proletariat.</p>
<p>Finally, what is worth reporting to the readers is that Mr. Tang Zengyang, the editor of Sunday Literature, has invited many famous writers at home and abroad to contribute. In terms of poetry, he has invited Mr. Huang Huoxia and Mr. Shao Guanhua to take charge. In terms of introductions, he has invited Mr. Yang Changxi to take charge. At the same time, Mr. Ni Yide, Mao Yibo, Cui Wanqiu, Xu Suling and other gentlemen are also willing to contribute some manuscripts. From this point of view, Sunday Literature is indeed showing a trend of "rising steadily."</p>

<h3 id="e148">The Most Gigantic Mail Ships of the East and West Oceans Face Peril <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Since the end of the European War, all sectors of the world have been vying to devote their full efforts to the shipping industry. Since the invention of the diesel engine, steam engines have abandoned coal and switched to burning oil, which not only eliminates smoke, coal dust, and gas on ships but also increases speed. This is truly a major innovation in the shipping industry. In just a few years, coal-fired steamships will become obsolete relics of the past, while oil-engine motor ships can be called modern new ships.</p>
<p>The Atlantic and Pacific Oceans are the focal points of the world's shipping industry. The Atlantic shipping route is the only route for transportation between Europe and the United States, so it is the center of competition for shipping companies from various countries, including Britain, the United States, Germany, France, Italy, and the Netherlands. The Atlantic Ocean is an indispensable route for passage to the Far East and is therefore an area of competition for shipping lines from both Japan and the United States. Due to the intensity of the competition, unprecedentedly large ships have been completed to break records. Now, please allow us to describe the unprecedented gigantic ships in both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Unprecedentedly Large Ship on the Atlantic Ocean Will Be Completed <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Among the shipping operators in the Atlantic Ocean, before the outbreak of the European War in 1914, the German shipping lines were the most powerful, followed by the British. At that time, the German Hapag-Lloyd Company had two of the largest mail ships, one called the Bismarck, with a capacity of 52,000 tons. The North German Lloyd also had a ship called the Lützow, weighing 46,000 tons, and another largest ship of 56,000 tons was under construction. At that time, the British Cunard Line, which confronted German ships in the Atlantic, had its largest ship named Aquitania, measuring 42,000 tons. When Germany was defeated in 1919 and the peace treaty was signed, the country possessed three gigantic ships in the history of world shipping, two of which were acquired by Britain. The 52,000-ton ship was purchased by the Cunard Line and renamed the Berengaria, while the 56,000-ton ship was bought by the White Star Line and renamed the Majestic. The largest ship, weighing 59,000 tons, was acquired by the United States and renamed the Leviathan. To this day, these gigantic ships still sail in the Atlantic Ocean, so the crown of the world's shipping industry still belongs to Britain, while the world's largest ship is in the United States. After its defeat in the war, Germany's national strength declined, but it still focused its efforts on the shipping industry. Therefore, within a few years, the North German Lloyd's 50,000-ton giant ships Europa and Bremen were completed again, actually competing with the victorious countries for the Atlantic shipping business.</p>
<p>The Atlantic Ocean is the concentration point of the world's giant ships. Ships of 20,000 to 30,000 tons have become ordinary ships. Only giant ships of 40,000 to 50,000 tons can win the favor of passengers. The material civilization and living standards of European and American countries are advanced, and many of those who travel to and from the Atlantic are aristocrats, dignitaries, the wealthy, and major merchants. The competition among shipping companies to outdo each other has further increased passengers' desires. They would rather pay high fares than take smaller ships. As a result, the world's unprecedentedly large ships have gathered on the Atlantic route. The route from New York to Southampton in England or Cherbourg in France is the focus of the competition among the world's large ships. There are more than fifty large ships of 30,000 tons or more, six or seven giant ships of 40,000 tons or more, and seven or eight magnificent mail ships of 50,000 to 60,000 tons, such as the Columbia, Bremen, Aquitania, Homeric, Europa, Paris, and Majestic, etc., all of which are great ships. On average, France is not as good as Germany, Germany is not as good as the United States, and the United States is not as good as Britain, and the maritime hegemony still belongs to Britain. Recently, in the Atlantic Ocean, the Cunard Line has added a 40,000-ton giant ship named Empress of Britain, and the White Star Line already has two 50,000-ton giant ships and is now planning to build an unprecedentedly large mail ship of 65,000 tons. Unexpectedly, the Cunard Line, upon hearing the news, did not yield and, in order to permanently occupy the first place in Atlantic shipping and the first place among the world's large ships, specially planned to build an extraordinarily large and fast mail ship that would shock the world. The construction cost has been set at £10 million, equivalent to 240 million Chinese dollars, and it is planned to start immediately and be contracted to the British Clydebank shipyard. The displacement of the extraordinarily large ship has been set at 70,000 tons, with a hull length of 1,070 feet. The ship will use electric motors and a 600,000-horsepower engine to travel at 33 nautical miles per hour on average, the same speed as the world's super-dreadnought cruisers, breaking the record for sea travel speed. The construction contract has already been signed by the Cunard Line and the shipyard. Therefore, the construction project of this unprecedented giant ship is very complicated. The Clydebank shipyard has employed more than 10,000 workers and will take four years to complete. Before building this world's largest ship, the shipping company and the shipyard spent a long time considering improvements to machinery and materials, collecting drawings, measuring models, and conducting tests, using dozens of specialized personnel and spending a great deal of preparatory money before research could be successful. First, specialized personnel drew diagrams of the ship's hull skeleton. After the company hired specialists to review them, they used blueprint paper and other materials to create a scaled-down model with a scale of tens of thousands to one and put it in a pool to test its performance and other results. At that time, the ship's model was tested in the pool of the National Institute of Physics and Chemistry, and dozens of experts watched the test. They carefully measured the speed, waves, and other aspects, and even created artificial wind and rain to test the ship's resistance. After several revisions, the ship's shape was finalized before being handed over to the factory for construction according to regulations. The ship will require more than fifty types of wood and mica for each rudder and hall will be specially purchased from Italy and Norway. It is said that the total length of the electrical wires used in the ship can be extended to 1,000 miles, with 30,000 light bulbs. The amount of steel used is even more astonishing. The hull is divided into thirteen decks. The upper deck alone can accommodate fifty train cars, and if a park were built on the bow, it would be large enough for horse racing. If the tallest 81-story building in New York were placed horizontally inside its large rudder, it would only occupy a small portion of the space. The number of passenger supplies prepared in the giant ship is truly staggering, such as 150,000 blankets and more than 5,000 beds. More than 60,000 sets of knives, forks, bowls, and plates will be used. In addition to the interior decoration, the hull alone will cost £7 million. When building the ship, the Cunard Line faced enormous costs and heavy responsibilities. If an accident occurred, it would have major implications. Therefore, it contacted insurance companies during construction to insure at least £7 million. The London and New York insurance companies were so astonished by the huge amount that no single company dared to underwrite the insurance. As a result, the British government, in order to encourage shipping and maintain its status as the world's shipping hegemon, agreed to underwrite the full amount of the ship's construction cost, while the remaining half was jointly underwritten by major British insurance companies. Once this issue was resolved, construction could begin. The hull is now under construction and the keel has also been laid. Around 1934, this world's largest ship will be able to sail on the Atlantic Ocean. After the ship is completed, it will overshadow all the existing large ships of more than 50,000 tons. The current major mail ships in the Atlantic Ocean are listed below:</p>
<p>Ship Name  Tonnage Length  Company Country</p>
<p>Leviathan  59,200 tons  922 feet  American Mail Line United States</p>

<p>(I)</p>
<p>Arise, compatriots, awaken!</p>
<p>The bayonets and cannons of Japanese imperialism,</p>
<p>Are aimed at the heads of all of us in the country,</p>
<p>Are you still dreaming? Still drunkenly drowsy?</p>
<p>Our Northeast will soon become their Manchuria and Mongolia,</p>
<p>On the walls of Shenyang, the Rising Sun flag flutters in the wind,</p>
<p>Inside Shenyang, fireworks burn wildly,</p>
<p>Our property, our houses, everything we have,</p>
<p>Has turned into ashes, smoke, scattering into nothing,</p>
<p>Look, the long spears and sharp blades of Japanese imperialism,</p>
<p>Are shooting and slaughtering our innocent people,</p>
<p>Look, the cannons and bombs of Japanese imperialism,</p>
<p>Have devastated our Northeast, leaving no land intact,</p>
<p>The blood of our compatriots stains the Three Heroes of Liaodong,</p>
<p>The corpses of our compatriots are spread across the landscape of Jinzhou,</p>
<p>Listen, the sounds of cannons and killing shake the universe,</p>
<p>The sounds of crying and wailing resonate through the clouds,</p>
<p>Listen, the battle horns are blowing along the Beining Railway,</p>
<p>The drums of war are thundering in the Pacific Ocean,</p>
<p>The world rolls into a turbulent chaos,</p>
<p>The sun and moon are obscured by a dismal gloom,</p>
<p>Compatriots, discerning compatriots,</p>
<p>Are you still dreaming? Still drunkenly drowsy?</p>
<p>Arise, compatriots, awaken!</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>Arise, compatriots, realize!</p>
<p>The conspiracies and poisonous schemes of Japanese imperialism,</p>
<p>Are like an electrical grid, laid out and arranged,</p>
<p>Are you still indifferent? Still turning a deaf ear and a blind eye?</p>
<p>Our entire country will fall into a vast trap,</p>
<p>Do not hope for international justice,</p>
<p>Do not hope for world sympathy,</p>
<p>Now, justice is in the hands of the powerful,</p>
<p>Sympathy is not planted in the hearts of mankind,</p>
<p>Do not believe in Kellogg's Pact of Paris,</p>
<p>Do not vainly hope for mediation by the League of Nations,</p>
<p>Now, treaties are merely empty words on paper,</p>
<p>Mediation is merely a pretty name to ease our people's anger,</p>
<p>Strong countries invade weak countries,</p>
<p>The masses kill the few,</p>
<p>Might makes right,</p>
<p>Right is might,</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>What justice is there?</p>
<p>What sympathy is there?</p>
<p>What pacts are there to consider?</p>
<p>What mediation is there to allow?</p>
<p>--The weak perish, the strong survive--</p>
<p>Let us not be calmly composed, composed,</p>
<p>Let us not be resolutely non-resistant, non-resistant,</p>
<p>Don't you hear? What others are saying,</p>
<p>In thirty-six hours, they will destroy China,</p>
<p>Today, by tomorrow night,</p>
<p>Alas, we will become lambs of a conquered nation,</p>
<p>Compatriots, facing the bleak future,</p>
<p>What pain do you feel in your hearts?</p>
<p>When handcuffs, shackles, and yokes are on our shoulders,</p>
<p>Yes, at that time, we can only be calmly composed, composed,</p>
<p>At that time, we can only be non-resistant, non-resistant,</p>
<p>The bloodstains of the Jinan Incident, the pain of the Xiamen Incident,</p>
<p>Have they all disappeared from our minds and hearts?</p>
<p>Compatriots, brave compatriots,</p>
<p>Can we still be composed? Can we still be non-resistant?</p>
<p>Arise, compatriots, realize!</p>
<p>(III)</p>
<p>Arise, compatriots, rally!</p>
<p>Japanese imperialism is sharpening its knives and whetting its swords,</p>
<p>Preparing to slaughter us on a large scale,</p>
<p>Can we still wait? Can we still hesitate?</p>
<p>Only a dead end lies before us,</p>
<p>We have a vast and expansive territory,</p>
<p>Why should we let others divide and occupy it?</p>
<p>We have more than 400 million compatriots,</p>
<p>Why should we let others slaughter us at will?</p>
<p>We have boiling blood,</p>
<p>To stain the turbid Pacific Ocean red,</p>
<p>We have vibrant energy,</p>
<p>To overturn the tiny Fusang,</p>
<p>We have courageous spirits,</p>
<p>To scold the sun, moon, wind, and clouds of the universe,</p>
<p>We have surging heroic spirit,</p>
<p>To swallow the world's land, sea, and air,</p>
<p>But alas, now we are filled with grief everywhere,</p>
<p>The jumping dwarfs are taking advantage of the opportunity to gather in our Liaodong,</p>
<p>Changchun is gone, Shenyang is gone, Jilin is also gone...</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of miles of land have fallen into the hands of others,</p>
<p>Our property is lost, our homes are lost, our lives are also lost...</p>
<p>The cold moon and autumn stars are mourning the lonely souls,</p>
<p>Now, only a dead end lies before us,</p>
<p>Can we still wait? Can we still hesitate?</p>
<p>Come, come, resolute compatriots,</p>
<p>Stir up our blood, ignite our energy,</p>
<p>Release our heroic spirit, rouse our courage,</p>
<p>Fight desperately, fight to the death with this monster of East Asia,</p>
<p>Extend our fists,</p>
<p>Beat to death these shameless jumping clowns,</p>
<p>Aim our cannons accurately,</p>
<p>At the tiny three provinces of Fusang,</p>
<p>This is the time for our country and nation to live or die,</p>
<p>This is the time when our country and nation hang by a thread,</p>
<p>Compatriots, resolute compatriots,</p>
<p>Can we still wait? Can we still hesitate?</p>
<p>Arise, compatriots, rally!</p>
<p>(IV)</p>
<p>Arise, compatriots, arm yourselves!</p>
<p>The sharp knives and blades of Japanese imperialism,</p>
<p>Are already pressed against our shoulders and backs,</p>
<p>Can we still be afraid? Can we still retreat?</p>
<p>The only way to deal with it is armed resistance,</p>
<p>"Rather be a war ghost, than a slave of a conquered nation!"</p>
<p>Even if our blood flows in the wilderness and our corpses rot in the cold rivers,</p>
<p>It is better than watching our wives and children separated and our country and homes destroyed,</p>
<p>Do not retreat, do not be afraid,</p>
<p>We must retaliate with a tooth for a tooth,</p>
<p>Do not be afraid, do not retreat,</p>
<p>Our 400 million corpses will fill the Pacific Ocean,</p>
<p>Our 400 million heads will flatten Fusang,</p>
<p>Throw away axes, sickles, and pens,</p>
<p>Pick up the bright blades and the shining spears,</p>
<p>Leave schools, fields, and factories,</p>
<p>Run to the yellow sand rolling, murderous battlefield,</p>
<p>With one heart and one mind, run forward bravely towards the enemy,</p>
<p>Kill, shout, fight desperately, struggle,</p>
<p>For the life or death of our country and nation,</p>
<p>Behold, the bright, victorious sun,</p>
<p>Will eventually shine upon our heads,</p>
<p>Compatriots, great compatriots,</p>
<p>Can we still be afraid? Can we still retreat?</p>
<p>Arise, compatriots, arm yourselves!</p>
<p>The whole country unites to resist!</p>
<p>The Melancholy Cultural Elite in the Garret</p>
<p>It was early yesterday morning, and I was lying on my soft bed, savoring a few lingering ancient poems when someone suddenly knocked on the door.</p>
<p>"Hurry, it's terrible, I have to tell you a terrible unfortunate news," it seemed to be Can's voice.</p>
<p>Terrible unfortunate news, what was it all about? I was afraid it was to amuse me with something funny. Just as I was thinking this, Can had already pushed the door open and entered. I saw the flesh on his face twitching, the hand holding a large roll of newspapers trembling, and his expression was so nervous, filled with indignation, depression, and unspeakable pain.</p>
<p>"What's wrong? What's worth making such a fuss about?" I quickly climbed out of bed, threw a book of poems aside, and knew that something was wrong.</p>
<p>"It's terrible, it's terrible, the Japanese soldiers have occupied the three northeastern provinces, such as Andong, Shenyang... all have been occupied, the armories have been destroyed, the people have been massacred, the troops have been disarmed..." He finally choked back his words, and hot tears rolled down from his eyes.</p>
<p>"Really? Why didn't I know anything beforehand? Where is it, let me see."</p>
<p>"Go and see," he threw the two newspapers in his hand onto the bed.</p>
<p>A diagonal line of red characters immediately came into my eyes:</p>
<p>Japanese soldiers - kill our compatriots, seize our guns, occupy our land for thousands of miles, destroy our armories, Chief of Staff Rong Zhen's entire family was captured, brigade commanders and regimental commanders were killed.</p>
<p>It really seemed like a bolt from the blue, shocking people's nerves and swelling my blood vessels. I almost fainted. I endured the pain and read each word, which were unbearable to read, one bloody word after another. This was the shame of my motherland. China, with its four thousand years of culture, had suddenly suffered this great humiliation, innocently subjected to the invasion of foreign tribes. Cruel Japanese bandits...</p>
<p>I finally couldn't read any further. My nerves were already numb.</p>
<p>"Why are the Japanese so brutal?" I said, as if exhaling.</p>
<p>"The most hateful thing is that they invaded us when we were suffering from floods. This is simply the behavior of beasts!" Can's face was also flushed, and his chest rose and fell rapidly. We were both stirred by indignant emotions. This narrow garret was filled with a depressive atmosphere, as tense as if it were about to explode. At this moment, all the compatriots in China who had blood, I am afraid, were as indignant as we were.</p>
<p>"It's a pity that the Chinese themselves are still attacking each other day and night and don't cooperate at all, which has led to this situation. It seems that we can only sit and wait for death..." I said.</p>
<p>"Yes, if there were no rebellions in Guangdong and Guangxi at this moment, and the national armies were all united against foreign enemies, I am afraid that we could still resist Japan a little."</p>
<p>We were silent for a moment again, looking at each other's faces, all of which were indignant. In our hearts, it was as if a heavy stone was pressing down.</p>
<p>"I think, rather than endure such humiliation, it would be better to start a war with them. Death is death, destruction is destruction, but at least a glorious page will remain in the history of the nation."</p>
<p>"Yes, let's fight them. We may not be destroyed. At most, we will lose land and soldiers, but that is also worthwhile."</p>
<p>"If the Chinese do not express themselves seriously this time, then the fate of the country in the future will be worse than the catastrophe after the Opium War."</p>
<p>"Yes, we have to tell them that the Chinese are not easy to deceive and that we still have hot blood."</p>
<p>"Ah, we should go and be soldiers. Run to the bloody borders, kill the damn pigs and dogs until their blood and flesh fly everywhere and not a single piece of armor remains!" Can's emotions were extremely excited. His raised voice shook the whole house. He clenched his fists and slammed them on the table, then lay down on the bed.</p>
<p>"Go and be a soldier, and go straight to the three islands of Fusang and kill all the enemies!"</p>
<p>The overwhelming anger and depression wrapped around us. We were both silent.</p>
<p>"But where is there an opportunity for us to fight the enemy? If the rulers do not abandon their personal interests and fight for China, then there is nothing we can do."</p>
<p>"That's not right, first we need our people to awaken and unite against foreign enemies, and then the rulers can use this force."</p>
<p>"Ah, will the Chinese never awaken? Are the Chinese destined to be slaves? God, those cold-blooded young people are probably still groaning in their decadent garrets and enjoying themselves among the red lights and green wine. Do they have no impression of their motherland in their minds..."</p>
<p>"We young people with blood should unite, save this crisis of the motherland, and save the 400 million compatriots who are about to become slaves of a conquered nation."</p>
<p>"Let's go and be soldiers, the motherland is about to perish!"</p>
<p>Our excited words were limited, but our unbridled enthusiasm and surging tide of blood were endless.</p>
<p>Two children of the motherland were so depressed in the garret.</p>
