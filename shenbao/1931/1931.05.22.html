<p>自由談一得之言  秋水　　摩登女子的哲學。以爲婚姻之於戀愛與夜晩之於睡眠一樣的不相關涉。　　一個女子。當伊結婚的當時。决不注意及於證婚之牧師。究竟爲狀何若。然而一個漂亮的律師。可以使其格外堅守着離婚契約。　　眞正的美。不在面貌而在心靈。然而摩登的少年。却還没有一雙鋭利的眼睛。可以看穿女人們心靈上的美醜。　　一般的女性。都喜歡他的丈夫有煤油大王的賺錢本領而又像好萊塢明星的會使錢。摩登社會上婚姻之難得美满。其理或即在此。　　對於仇人像猛虎。對於友人像綿羊。明槍易躱。暗箭難防。一個人的禍難。泰半來自友人而不起於仇人。　　婚姻與政治一樣。夫妻間的風潮。輒有一第三黨在裏面作祟。要治療婚姻上所産生的一切疾苦。只好是根本剷滅那第三黨。　　男子們在戀愛上極少求得經騐。因爲你落入情網之後。就目炫心迷。失去了原有的知識。否則。他們這一次失敗了以後。爲什麽第二次又會重蹈覆轍的呢。　　結婚以前。一個男子輒津津樂道其駕御女性的理論。及至結婚以後。他就不得不去研究怎樣的可以暫時脱離了他妻子的覊絆。技擊餘聞  青松居士　　少林宗派已如前述。顧尚有女子數人。亦餘勇可賈。一時無兩。未始不可爲矜式。因再略述所聞。以爲究心國術者告也。　　陳扆蓮者。舊松屬之由拳少女也。拳藝絶羣。尤精劍術。時有曾南庾者。亦奇士。任俠好擊劍。一日晌午。少女踵門請比劍。雲髮覆額。神清若雪。怪而問焉。女曰相約郎官到莊上試劍。餘言何置喙爲也。及期而往。女已先在。繡裳錦服。捧劍而立。倐忽間颯颯有聲。白光旋轉。女於光中飛舞。隱約不可見。而鋒鋩駭疾。捷如鷹隼。曾乃目眩神辣。呆視若木鷄。自此退避三舍。不敢以劍術自矜焉。　　同光年間。我松之附郭鄉村。時被盜刦。東鄙有王氏子。世家而巨富。盜埀涎已久。一夜有暴客一餘人。明火執仗。破扉而入。某與妻心驚膽戰。不知所爲。幸新納一妾。急中生智。摸索屋中一拐杖。拔關突出。舞動如風。鳴鉤震擊。當者辟易。羣盜仆地蒲伏。亡魂鼠竄。而王氏財産。竟無損失。盜亦咸有戒心。不敢時肆覬覦。蓋妾一奇女子。芳名艶香。葉其姓。父爲拳棒名師。女得盡傳其術。不啻萬人敵。故擊賊若狗彘。而所向披靡也。　　五十年前。茸城泗涇鎭。來一異方少婦。不詳其姓字。年輕貌美。日游於市。衣裝艶麗。眉目如畫。腰肢婀娜。弱不勝衣。雙尖瘦小。俏如菱角。鎭中無賴艶其色。趨之若鶩。爭欲博一餐以爲榮。顧少婦懔若冰霜。急切不得犯。諸無賴以爲個妮子嬌弱可欺。一人直前撲之。而婦蓮鈎略舉。已顚仆百步外。衆益憤。合力共攻之。婦乃揮拳抵敵。略無懼怯。踔厲風發。操縱裕如。一無賴見不能取勝。暗投一石子。適中其額。婦遂忍痛跳圈外。身輕似燕。疾走如飛。瞬息已不知所之矣。心喪記  十一齡女生杜小梅　　維共和二十年仲夏。業師王夫子梅璩。於四日遽爾仙遊。十日暫厲於聨義山莊。於斯時也。微雨數點。土不揚塵。說者謂後世必昌。此夫子之福歟。夫子循循然善誘人。誠有古風。而今竟溘然長逝矣。夫子之德。何日能忘。噫。浮生若夢。誠非妄言。若以外貌景仰。軒昻磊落。倔强不凡。今埋藏地下。同歸於盡。亦未必異於常人。而夫子之文傳四海。德播千秋。可使余後生小子永不能忘者也。茲謹記後。不覺悲凉凄愴。惘惘如有所失焉。嗚呼。並附輓王夫子聨於後。　　百歲實難逢。昨日彌留仍面笑。　三年親受業。今朝餘痛到心喪。（却酬）其二  十二齡女生陳潔蘩　　嗚呼。業師王夫子梅壉。竟於國歷仲夏四日午後二時歸道山矣。越二日星期三。出殯於聨義山莊。暫厝焉。至日昨爲奉安之期。因事起怱促。故送客甚少。溯自夫子仙遊後。日夕陰雨連綿。純現一種凄凉景象。夫子遺族尚有妻即數人。均血淚蹙踊。慘不可言。現尚未開弔。吾等目前功課雖停。惟時刻繫掛在心。未嘗或釋也。。夫子在日曾賜我名。曰潔蘩。茲奉母諭曰。此名爲夫子所命。切不可忘也。因再爲文記之。然永記者。又豈僅一名而已乎。　　附輓王夫子梅據聨　　循循敎我忽離世。赫赫名師别暮春。（却酬）小金魚之更水譚  吳吉人　　陽春天氣。百物孶生。我愛金魚。爰將金魚卵化後之飼養更水工作。紀實本譚。迨亦啫痂諸君所樂聞者歟。　　魚卵着藻。其七日孵化經過。已如前述。時小魚方脱穎而出。四出覓食。斯時之目力口勁。均極穉嫩。不能如長成者之敏鋭。且母魚旣乏餵養之力。故小魚僅能遇物而食。一無追覓爭逐之術。我人此時。可聽其自然。祇須秧魚缸中之水。不稍移動或更易。日給水蛆足矣。如或蓄者性躁。見身水過穢。另易生水。則全缸小魚。頃刻頓絶。無少許留。緣秧魚初胎。依原水爲生。尚無自動能力。迨半月以後。魚色已黑。然後擇天氣晴明之辰。取一竹筐。外緣細紗。縫固如黏。而持置秧缸中。及筐中盛水已满。再另取一小器。掏去筐中之水。（掏去之水。以掏至半缸爲度。）使魚身無絲毫影響。掏水工作旣畢。隨即加入生水。所加水量。當與掏出之多寡相等。又須多給水蛆。如法飼之。則不一二日而小魚即可長大至一倍以上。更閲二星期。再依前法易水。當能長大至半寸許。細種頭角。即可漸露。色亦隨之而變矣。滬濡訪佛記  周元琪　　去秋。老友化佛。嘗來首都。舉行佛畫展覽會。與其流連詩酒者。幾旬日。鬯談間得悉化佛組藝乘書畫會於南京路。囑走來滬之便。一讀佛畫。顧走于役京華。絶鮮暇晷。茲以春光明媚之時偶作歸計。乃訪佛於南京路。豈料藝乘已作喬木之鶯遷。在三馬路雲南路口矣。與佛晤。握手大快。化佛頗健於談。爲言寒雲之不壽。欷歔無已。化佛擬繪萬佛。造一萬佛樓供奉之。寒雲生前嘗贈以聨云。「揮灑千秋。心靈三藐。因緣萬佛。天地一樓」。見聨思人。不覺憮然。劉海粟氏嘗藏宋元佛像五十餘幀。以化佛之耽佛。贈以上方廣衆德佛畫一尊。莊嚴華妙。爲今世所罕見。衣褶用流水行雲法出之。色彩神態。濃妙精深。海粟有跋語云。以之比擬内府及東西京所藏。大觀如此者。皆無之。足見此畫之冠絶後世也。化佛繪畫。素以四尺爲限。今春忽雅興勃發。竟作八尺巨幅。一壯繆。一壽翁。均栩栩生動。爲化佛畫中所不多覯者。詢之化佛。方知此二畫。殆贈與海上聞人黄金榮先生者也。化佛除於畫佛外。更蜚聲戲劇界。刻擬組織一樂樂社票房。伶界中若金碧艶張桂芬賈翰卿等。均在贊助之例。前途之光明。當可預卜。藝乘書畫會。雖祗小樓一楹。而結搆殊精。墨瀋琳瑯。金碧輝映極盡佈置之能事。非化佛曷克致此哉。乃樂爲之記（却酬）黄海環遊記（一○）  黄炎培　　民國十六年十二月全鮮同時發生排華行動。殺傷吾國人無數。日本警察視若無覩。就是這種政策的表現。自然。一旦他們爲满蒙問題對我或對蘇俄有事時。萬一鮮人搗亂他們的後方。這是何等可怕的事情呢。　　我國人遊朝鮮者。總想一遊吳武壯祠。朝鮮壬午之變。中國政府調廣東水師提督吳長慶率登州兵以七月度韓鎭攝。亂旣定。韓人倚若長城。居三年。移金州。旋卒於軍。謚曰武壯。韓人爲之建祠。曰靖武祠。嗣日本統監府欲廢止之。華僑力爭。乃移歸中華總領事管理。祠在京城南明哲坊訓練洞。有碑刊光緒八年隨征將士題名。首列優貢江蘇通州張審。第二十一名營務處同知河南項城袁世凱。「少賤未殊衆。貴來方悟稀。」不錯。這番遊朝鮮。不料得到一批寳物。在總領事署。承領事季君達。魏君錫賡等的指示。獲檢閲朝鮮未亡國前中韓間各種重要擋案。摘鈔了不少史料。壬午之變。也是其中一部分。　　朝鮮風俗。應該大大的改良。勤。儉。信實。這種民族建國的要素。與個人自立的信條。他們都感缺乏。一女僕領到了工資。不及回家。已儘量用光。到家還是借債度日。告假三天。總須四天五天纔肯銷假。親友間一人作官。蠭擁去就食謀事。我四年前遊鮮所認識的某局長朝鮮人。此次訪問。則早被革職了。問何以故。則因身爲局長。一班親戚故舊。天天到他家喫飯。活活的把他喫窮。到不了時。收受了一筆贓欵。案發。革職。風俗的不良。是亡國的一大原因。「殷鑒不遠。」吾們不暇爲一身一家計。爲國家及民族前途計。對於這種懶惰。浮華。浪費。不自立種種不良風俗。究竟取怎樣態度纔是呢。說部扶輪會霍桑探案轉灣（二一）  程小青　　（七）餐館中所見　　人們常說性情的緩急。往往因着年齡而轉移。我的年齡雖然已不是血氣方剛的少年。但卞急的性情。却至今没有改變。我好容易耐了兩天。到第三天仍舊消息渺然。我因想起了那個笨伯邱奎。我曾和他約定三天的期限。必須查明那人的下落。我明知他不會有什麽成績。但也打了一個電話到第四分署裏去。據那署長張寳全說。邱奎日日夜夜在外面奔波。却還没有查明。故而請我再寛限他三天。我聽了這話。起先固覺得邱奎可惡可恨。現在却又祗覺得他如憐。　　這樣又挨過了三天。到了第六天的晩上。我正在家中進膳。霍桑的電話來了。請我換一身衣裳。趕緊到卡洛頓西菜館去。我心中暗暗懷疑。霍桑平日不甚喜歡西菜。怎麽今夜裏約我到這樣高價的西人菜館裏去。但我一接電話。也没有功夫仔細推索他的用意。我和佩芹說明了一句。放了飯碗。換上一件黑毛葛夾袍。緊緊趕去。這卡洛頓菜館在靜安路西段。地點比較冷靜。食客們以西人和菲列濱人居多。我國的顧客不過十之一二。並且我國人到這裏來的。目的不在示闊。却祇是抱着特别目的的少年男女。我一進門口。除了帽子。便踏進一間廣大的餐室。餐室中布置得非常富麗。地上舖着厚厚的毯子。走路時絶無聲響。淡藍色的油壁。罩着幽淡的燈光。餐桌上白綢的檯布。銀質的刀叉。每桌上都供列着異色的鮮花。食客雖已有了六七成光景。談話時却都放低語聲。絶無尋常餐館的喧閙呌器。却有一種幽靜的趣味。我站住了向四面一瞧。見這廣室的右邊的裏角。霍桑正靠着一隻圓桌。舉着杯子正在飲水。他也換了衣服。穿一身藏青白細綫條的嗶嘰西裝。我走到他的面前。他祇和我點一點頭。我便坐了下來。這時那侍者正端了兩盆牛尾湯上來。霍桑仍默默無言的開始飲湯。我雖抱着满腹的疑團。一時也不敢開口。等到飲完了湯。第二道菜剛才上來。霍桑忽把頭前傾了些。低聲向我說道。「你先瞧瞧我的背後。可認識他麽。」</p>

<p>青年園地爲新東方詩社答邵冠華王一心　　冠華兄、　　你給新東方詩社和給我個人的信都拜讀了、關於新東方詩社、我還得和你談談、因爲你對於它似乎還有些誤會、在這裏我不能不和你解釋一下、　　第一、我們的主張是「反對模倣西洋詩、自己創造富於東方情緒的詩歌、」我覺得模倣是創作的、初部、無論詩歌或小說、至於「影響」、自然不能和「模倣」相對論、「模倣」是有意的、而「影響」是無形的、無形的影響我們不敢反對、有意的「模倣」我們却不敢同情了、我們說出這話、是因爲目下的中國詩人太歡喜模倣了、他們不但是外形模倣西洋詩、就是情緒也有矯揉造作失去眞實的地方、似乎模倣西洋詩是一件時髦的事情、這、我們是極端反對的、至於「自已創造富於東方色彩的詩歌」的「東方色彩」四字是「東方情緒」四字的錯誤、所謂「東方情緒」也者自然不單是中國舊詩裏的情緒才算是「東方」「東方」二字的意義是很廣的、只要不去矯揉造作的去模倣西洋、東方人所表現的情緒自然是「東方的」了、這並不是閉關自守、在我個人、我覺得非但要創造「東方情緒的詩歌、」而且要創造「一心自己的情緒的詩歌」、非但要在詩裏表現「東方的特色一」、而且要表現「一心的特色」、那麽我不是更閉關自守了嗎、創作是一件事、鑑賞是一件事、多鑑賞西洋詩我們是極端贊成的、否則、我們何以還要把「翻譯東西詩歌」列入工作範圍的第一項、多介紹西洋詩歌我們當然極端贊同、能彀多翻譯西洋詩歌是最好不過的、但我們不希望創作也像翻譯一樣、　　詩的内質是靈魂、自然不能不加以重視、但我覺得「形式」的重要並不低於内質的重要、詩不是散文、在形式上不能不注意到圖案、詩的形式不是每句每行寫就算、但也不能像五言七絶一樣的呆板、於賡虞的只能運用一種形式丨方塊兒丨所以他的詩在外形上就不免失散了、他的失敗和五言七律的失敗一樣、「太呆板、」我們知道詩的形式也和圖案畫一樣的可以自由變化、五角形也好、長方形也好、三角形以致於雪花形蝴蝶形都好、實際上没有侵犯到形式、誰如果說圖案畫没有變化、只能怪他自已不懂圖案畫、不能作圖案畫、新詩的形式也有一樣的道理、而且、形式在技巧上運用純熟了是不會影響到内質的、　　關於詩、不是幾句話可以說完的、我將來預備寫一本「新詞講話」、再來詳細叙述我對於新詩的種種意見、我希望我們以後能彀時常討論討論、把我們討論的成績印行一本「新詩討論集」、　　弟王一心謹覆、五、一八○、中公劇社定期公演  心　　中國公學戲劇研究社現已改名簡稱「中公劇社」、從成立到現在、時間不過兩個多月、但他們的精神實在比中公其他集團都好、社員程一戎、李民棪、歐陽信、武翰章、張兆和、張仲華、張良澤等、尤爲出力、出版方面、因爲經濟關係、只能每週出一期壁報、現在已經出到第四期了、前次由執委議决、本學期决定在吳淞本校公演一次、日期定於六月六日、劇本已選定三幕劇「梅羅香」、由該劇作者顧仲彝先生導演、現在已經排演過好幾次、聽說該社社友爲限制人數和尊重藝術起見、每位需要須入塲券洋二角、交大女生排球隊復興  荃　　交通大學女生排球隊、濫觴於民國十六年、當時健將如雲、成績爲海上各大學冠、不幸次年健將陶蒓女士因病輟學、陶菊芬女士適人退學、而金咸瑊女士又因故轉學復旦、主力分散、潰不成軍、又該年入學考試、女生被取者絶無僅有、遂使排球覊業、一蹶不振、論者咸惜之、去年春、陶蒓女士病愈復學、當時雖有重興覊業之議、但以後起乏人、人數不足、一木焉能支大夏、且陶女士大病之後、體力不充、不能劇烈運動、重興覇業之議、至是遂闐焉無聞、暑假後、女生來考者頗不乏人、新進之士、擅長運動者、亦甚衆、而</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary: The New Five-Year Plan of Soviet Russia</p>
<p>A Moscow dispatch states that the highest-ranking officials of the People's Committee have formed a special committee to formulate a new five-year plan to be implemented after the completion of the current plan. It is believed that the work of the original plan must be linked so that the national construction project will not be interrupted. This is also a matter worthy of attention. The original five-year plan of Soviet Russia initially sought survival, and ultimately aimed to overthrow the world's economic organization. The new plan will inevitably advance further with this aim, which goes without saying. However, under the current economic situation, countries are seeking ways to survive. Any plan that harms their survival will be suppressed with all their might. All countries coexist under one economic organization, and if someone destroys the organization, all countries will rise up to deal with it, which also goes without saying. Countries with strong economic power, although affected by the recession, can still maintain their course by using their agile skills to withstand the tide of external influences and maintain their course. If their financial resources are not very strong, and they are greatly affected by the commercial downturn, they will not be able to withstand any unexpected trend that forces them to cope with it by any means necessary. The world's turmoil arises from this. Today, the United States' attention is still focused on the silver problem, believing that solving the silver problem is enough to save the economic doom. The United Kingdom, France, Germany, Austria, and other countries are focused on tax treaties and reparations debts, believing that solving these problems can also save today's economic doom, but they do not know that the economic doom is always determined outside of the problems that are being haggled over.

<p>Foreign Important Telegrams: League of Nations Expresses Willingness to Cooperate Closely with China</p>
<p>The Health Proposal Has Been Accepted</p>
<p>Special dispatch from Geneva by the National Society on the 20th. On May 19th, the Council of the League of Nations held its second meeting. The proposal for cooperation between the expert groups of the League of Nations and the newly established National Economic Council of the National Government of China was submitted for discussion at the meeting. The proposal was unanimously passed by the representatives of the member states, which proves the very good impression and trust of the great powers' governments in the National Government. This is truly an unprecedented victory for China in the League of Nations meetings. British Foreign Secretary Henderson praised the National Government leaders' foresight in establishing the National Economic Council and the National Government's great achievements in quelling the destruction of national peace and unification over the years in extremely warm terms. He also hoped that the Council would unanimously accept this proposal so that China and the Western countries could have fuller and closer cooperation. He also said that he hoped to personally express the same feelings to the National Government leaders in Geneva recently. After the British Foreign Secretary finished speaking, the Italian Foreign Minister Grandi gladly stood up to express his support for the proposal and pointed out the specialized nature of the proposal and the necessity of cooperation between countries for its complete realization. The Japanese Ambassador to France, Arakawa, continued to speak, stating Japan's friendship towards the Republic of China, and moved to accept the proposal, because its content is limited to the technical scope. The Japanese representative also hoped that the League of Nations could accommodate Japanese experts in the implementation of its various plans. He also said that the Japanese Director of the League of Nations Council will pay close attention to the step-by-step development of the cooperation plan, believing that it will be a powerful arm for China's future stability and prosperity. Next, French Foreign Minister Briand made a speech declaring that the French government is willing to sincerely support any proposal submitted by the National Government to the League of Nations. After the Directors finished speaking, Dr. Wu Liande represented the National Government of China and made a speech, thanking the League of Nations members for their enthusiastic support for the proposal. He continued that the impartiality and suitability of the cooperation plan that the Chinese government and the League of Nations Health Expert Group have already implemented proves that the various cooperation plans listed in the proposal will surely proceed smoothly. He also said that China is happy to accept any cooperation suggestions put forward by the League of Nations, because this cooperation will surely enable China to make practical contributions to general cultural undertakings. Finally, the Director of the Council and Day Chairman and German Foreign Minister Curtis made a speech, saying that the unanimous and enthusiastic support of all members of the League of Nations Council for the proposal is a rare enthusiasm in the League of Nations meetings. He also pointed out that this cooperation will not only benefit China but will also benefit all members of the League of Nations.</p>
<p>League of Nations Executive Committee Continues to Discuss Disarmament</p>
<p>Issue of Arms Disclosure</p>
<p>Russian Representative Supports German Proposal</p>
<p>Italy and the United Kingdom and France Speak with One Voice</p>
<p>Special dispatch from Geneva by the National Society on the 20th. German Foreign Minister Curtis expressed to Spanish Foreign Minister Le Roues today that Germany is extremely pleased with the enthusiasm of the Spanish new government for international work regarding the selection of Geneva by the Council of the League of Nations as the venue for the disarmament conference next year and not accepting Spain's invitation to hold it in Barcelona. Furthermore, when discussing disarmament events today, an unexpected event occurred, that is, Italy changed its attitude in the Disarmament Preparatory Committee, did not agree with Germany's proposal to require countries to announce their arms and reserve force material storage, etc., but joined the United Kingdom, Japan, France, Poland, and other countries in jointly opposing it. Therefore, the only one who supported Germany's proposal was the Soviet Russian representative Litvinov. From this, it can be seen that the world's great powers today still regard genuine disarmament as too early.</p>
<p>Italian to Continue as Commissioner of Danzig</p>
<p>Special dispatch from Geneva by the National Society on the 20th.

Count Gravina has always attached great importance to Danzig's sovereignty. Poland has repeatedly committed acts of infringement, which have been stopped by Gravina's best efforts. Therefore, Gravina's re-election is welcomed by the people of Danzig.</p>

Although the salary reduction has been strongly opposed by railway employees, primary school teachers, etc., the cabinet is still determined to implement it so that the budget can be balanced. However, it is currently proposed to apply it to those with monthly salaries of more than 50 yuan. If so, only a little more than 10 million yuan can be saved annually. If the original proposal is followed, 25 million yuan can be saved. The leader of the People's Political Party has passed a resolution at a meeting, urging the government to implement the salary reduction plan as soon as possible to save the current financial difficulties. However, the matter has not been implemented, and grievances have risen everywhere. According to the opinions of the general public, if it is implemented, it is feared that it will cause political turmoil.</p>

<p>Opposition Party Plots to be Unfavorable to the Government</p>
<p>Capital City Declares Temporary Martial Law</p>
<p>Special dispatch from Havana by the National Society on the 20th. Today is the Cuban Independence Anniversary. The Cuban government has declared martial law in the capital city, sent troops to patrol the entire city, and monitored the opposition party to prevent any actions to overthrow the government. Because Cuban President Machado has been in office for six years, the opposition party believes that the term of office has expired and the extended four years are illegal. They also point out that the government has wasted national currency on public works and has failed to raise sugar prices, resulting in an economic panic. They have been constantly plotting political change, so the current government is strictly guarding against it.</p>
<p>American Congressmen Pass Through the Philippines to China</p>
<p>Investigate the Silver Price Problem</p>
<p>Remarks by Soulders upon Returning to San Francisco</p>
<p>Special dispatch from Manila by the National Society on the 21st. American Senator Urdell and Robinson, Congressman Dwyer and Gilbertson, etc., arrived here today on the Hunterson transport ship. Urdell is a representative of the famous silver-producing Nevada state. In his capacity as Chairman of the Senate Mining Committee, he came to the Far East to investigate the silver market and the impact on trade between the Far East and the United States. He recently discussed the silver market with reporters from the American Federation of Societies, saying that if world trade is to be restored to its former state, it is necessary to quickly raise and stabilize silver prices, but the matter is very difficult and requires cooperation from the Far East and European countries. Because stabilizing silver prices is not tied to the amount of production, but to whether silver is used in currency. The surplus of silver in the world and the drop in silver prices are all caused by the reduction in the use of silver in currency. According to the members' visit to the Philippines, it is for general observation and they will still take the transport ship to China on the 26th, and are expected to arrive in Shanghai on June 1st.</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch from New York on the 21st. The famous League of Nations economic expert Sir Soulders said today when he arrived in San Francisco from the Far East that international cooperation and assistance to China to enable it to restore trade on a silver standard is an urgent task. China is now striving to create industrial independence economically. Any country that helps to solve China's financial problems will surely open up one of the world's largest markets.</p>
<p>British Conservative Party Questions the China Merchants Bureau's Dismissal of British Employees</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch from London on the 20th. Conservative Party member Samuel asked the government in the Lower House today to instruct Minister Lan, the ambassador to China, to investigate the reasons for the dismissal of several British employees after the Chinese government took over the China Merchants Bureau. Deputy Foreign Secretary Dalton replied that Minister Lan has paid close attention to the events since the reorganization of the China Merchants Bureau in 1928 and has made representations for the British employees who have left their jobs at any time. The Foreign Ministry can now ask Minister Lan to investigate the reason why the employees' salaries have not been received. It was found that the employees did not receive prior notice of dismissal and should be paid their salaries. The Chinese judge also ruled that the employees won the case, but the salaries that should have been received have not been paid. Minister Lan will take all possible actions regarding this matter.</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch from London on the 20th. Conservative Party member Miller asked in the Lower House this afternoon whether the negotiations on extraterritoriality between Minister Lan and the Chinese Foreign Minister reopened in Nanjing were based on the instructions previously issued by the British government. Deputy Foreign Secretary Dalton replied that the instructions given by the government to the British ambassador must be kept secret during the negotiations. Miller then asked the Lower House whether the basis for this negotiation could not be heard. Dalton replied that now is not the time.</p>
<p>Public Telegram</p>
<p>A telegram from Kaifeng: "We salute all newspaper offices. We hereby send a telegram to the Central Party Headquarters and the National Government, which reads: 'The country is roughly settled, and the people are yearning. If there is any humanity, how can we bear to talk about destruction again? Unexpectedly, just as the Central Government is holding the National Assembly and striving for political training and construction, Gu Yingfen and others have issued a 30-word telegram, picking up frivolous words and speaking nonsense. At first, we thought it was a personal dispute, and there was a way to resolve it properly. Unexpectedly, Chen Jitang re-issued the Jiang telegram, fueling the flames, using crazy words, and wantonly slandering. If the resignation of Comrade Hu is used as a pretext to play a role, I don't know that the personal advancement and retreat of Comrade Hu has its own decision by the highest organ of the party. Why should Chen Jitang intimidate at will? Commander-in-Chief Jiang leads the revolution, and his achievements are in the party and the country. His worries and vigilance are seen by the people of the country. Although there are occasional disagreements with Comrade Hu on political views this time, it is also a common occurrence. Commander-in-Chief Jiang is of course not liable for any legal responsibility. If they must use this to impeach, is there no formal procedure to follow? Chen Jitang, on the one hand, sends telegrams, recklessly attacks and calculates, confusing the public, and on the other hand, forces away the commander, colludes with Zhang Gui, recruits troops and levies wealth, and the situation is becoming increasingly urgent. He intends to rely on force to betray the party and the country and occupy Lingbiao, self-sufficient in wisdom and self-reliant in heroism. It is already clear and obvious. At this moment, the initial dawn of peaceful reunification has appeared, and political training and construction have a rough outline. Chen Jitang is mad, goes against the trend, not only destroys unity and hinders political training, but also promotes the fierce flames of the Red Bandits and endangers the safety of the lives and property of the people across the country. Such rebellious traces are obvious, and his nature is prone to chaos. He is truly a sinner of the party and the country, and he is abandoned by the people. The party discipline and national laws are not tolerated. We propose that the Central Committee condemn and punish him to eliminate the rebels, maintain unity, and benefit political training. Shi and others devote themselves to the revolution, only knowing how to support the party and the country. There is no personal grievance. Seeing the ferocity, they are filled with anger. We will do our best to lead our troops and serve. The public enemy of the party thieves will never stand side by side. The telegram cannot express the urgency of our indignation.' It is hoped that the sages and philosophers of the party and the country will share our righteous indignation and unanimously advocate to eliminate the ferocity and maintain the foundation of the country. The party and the country are fortunate.

The National Assembly Adds a Budget After Completion</p>
<p>More Than 330,000 for Secret Police and Security Offices</p>
<p>An Additional 114,000 Yuan is Now Requested</p>
<p>The National Government instructed the Executive Yuan and the Control Yuan on the 19th: "According to the document submitted by the Civil Service Department of this government, it is stated that the National Assembly's Secretariat letter Min Zi No. 107 states that the various expenses required for the National Assembly were previously prepared by Chu Tsang in the preparatory period of the Secretariat, and separate payment budgets were prepared for the Secretariat and the Security Offices. The Secretariat's budget was 292,670 yuan, and the Security Office's budget was 42,554 yuan, totaling 335,224 yuan. It has already been submitted to the National Government's Directive No. 1124 for approval. However, it was found that the original budget listed by the Secretariat did not include travel expenses for attending and attending representatives and reception staff fees. In addition, the Security Office also increased fees for purchasing equipment, etc. It is now proposed to add 90,115 yuan for the travel expenses of the attending representatives, 15,500 yuan for the travel expenses of the attending representatives, and 6,110 yuan for the travel expenses of the reception staff accompanying the representatives from various provinces and cities, totaling 111,725 yuan for the supplementary budget of the Secretariat. In addition, the supplementary budget for purchasing equipment, etc., for the Security Office is estimated at 3,000 yuan. The total supplementary budget for the two offices is 114,725 yuan. Correspondingly, separate supplementary budgets have been prepared, and this letter is sent to your office for verification and transfer for approval, and the order is given to the Executive Yuan to instruct the Ministry of Finance to issue it according to the budget, and the order is given to the Control Yuan to transfer it to the Audit Department for verification. The reasons for maintaining public friendship, etc., should be presented for your review, and approval should be given. In addition to issuing separate orders, the original budget of two copies is enclosed, ordering the Yuan to transfer it to the Ministry of Finance for verification and issue the required amount, and the Audit Department is to verify it, this order."</p>
<p>He Jian Reports on the Situation of the Red Bandits in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi Provinces</p>
<p>Many Followers of the Bandits Are Awakening and Surrendering</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence, The Red Bandits in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces mostly originated in Hunan. The important bandits Zhu, Mao, Peng, Huang, etc., except for Zhu De, who is from Yunnan, are all from Hunan. He Jian, Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Government and Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth Route Army, has thoroughly investigated the origins, current latent situation, and existing strength of the Red Bandits in the three provinces. He specially wrote a report and submitted it to the National Government: "The Hunan Communists, since being severely damaged in May of the 16th year of the Republic of China, Mao Zedong and other important members have been lurking in the areas of Chaling and Lianhua in Jiangxi. Although there are many bandits, there are very few firearms. In the winter of that year, Zhu De of the Jiangxi Army rebelled and combined with Mao, and they disturbed the various prefectures of southern Hunan and southern Jiangxi. There were nearly 2,000 firearms and more than 10,000 bandits. In the autumn of the 17th year, Peng Dehuai and Huang Gonglue rebelled in Pingjiang, and He Long secretly returned to Sangzhi. As a result, the strength of the Communist bandits suddenly increased. Because the Hunan and Hubei government troops have repeatedly failed in their years of suppression and because Soviet Russia has provided assistance and replenishment, the situation has secretly grown and the number of people coerced has gradually increased, resulting in a situation that is not easy to clean up. It is estimated that when the bandits invaded Changsha twice in the autumn of the 19th year, their strength was about as follows: Peng Dehuai's unit of the pseudo-Third Army, more than 6,000 rifles, more than 40 machine guns, and more than 10,000 spear bandits; Huang Gonglue's unit of the Fourth Army, more than 3,000 rifles and 4,000 to 5,000 spear bandits; He Changgeng's unit of the Eighth Army, more than 2,000 rifles and 2,000 to 3,000 spear bandits; Kong Hechong's unit of the Sixteenth Army, more than 2,000 rifles and 3,000 to 4,000 spear bandits; Li Can's unit of the Independent Fifth Division, more than 1,000 rifles; Liu Xiangyun and Chen Shao's unit of the Independent Division, a total of 700 to 800 rifles and 2,000 to 3,000 spear bandits; Zhang Jingwu's unit of the Liuyang Red Guards General Command, more than 300 rifles and more than</p>

<p>Mastermind of Attempted Assassination of a Certain Important Person Arrested, Native of Fenghua, Jiang Baoguo</p>
<p>Yesterday, Director Chen of the Municipal Public Security Bureau suddenly received a tip-off, stating that Jiang Baoguo, the mastermind behind an attempted assassination of a certain important person last autumn, had been feigning a lung disease for months and hiding under an alias in a regular ward of the Siming Hospital behind the Empire Theatre on Avenue Joffre in the French Concession. The informant urged the bureau to send officers to arrest him as soon as possible. Upon hearing this, Director Chen immediately ordered Detective Captain Lu Yiying to personally lead several officers to the French Concession Special Branch yesterday morning around 11 AM, bearing a document requesting assistance with the arrest. The Branch Chief ordered Western Detective Bardet to accompany them, and the suspect was apprehended on the spot. He was first taken to the police station for a brief interrogation. Jiang confessed that he was 34 years old and a native of Fenghua. From 1922 to 1927, he served as a guard for a certain important person, holding the rank of lieutenant. He initially denied the assassination plot. After the interrogation, he was handed over to Captain Lu to be taken back to the Public Security Bureau for further questioning.</p>
<p>Various Circles Issue Telegrams Supporting Peace</p>
<p>Since the Guangdong incident occurred, various circles in this city have been sending telegrams to warn Chen Jitang and others. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e2">Telegram from the Fourth District Party Headquarters <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Omissions) Now that the period of political tutelage has begun, the primary focus should be on construction, and the key to construction lies in peace. The realization of peace depends on the unification of the nation. Since the founding of the Republic, internal wars have been rampant, leaving the people impoverished and the nation exhausted. Looking around, we see only devastation and suffering. Ambitious warlords have taken advantage of the situation, exploiting and plundering the people, further weakening the nation's vitality and shaking its foundations. The convening of the National Congress in the capital was an unprecedented event. However, unfortunate events have once again arisen in Guangdong. The news has caused deep shock and concern. War is a dangerous thing, and conflict is devastating. Renewed conflict will not only inflict more suffering on our people, turning them into starving refugees, but also prevent the abolition of unequal treaties and hinder the improvement of our international standing. This is deeply regrettable. In recent days, telegrams have been pouring in from all over the country, filled with benevolent and insightful words, expressing deep concern and commanding widespread respect. If those involved can repent and turn back from the brink, it would not be too late to mend the fence. The Central Government has always been magnanimous and will surely understand everything. We urge all parties to prioritize the interests of the Party and the nation, and to place the lives of the people above all else, working together to overcome difficulties, uphold national integrity, turn swords into plowshares, and establish a lasting peace for the nation. This would be a great blessing for the country and its people. We respectfully submit our humble plea and hope that you will take it into consideration.</p>

<h3 id="e3">Telegram from the Eighth District Party Headquarters <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Omissions) Greetings to all. Twenty years have passed since the founding of the Republic, but turmoil and disorder have continued unabated. War has ravaged homes and villages, bandits have run rampant, and starvation has been widespread. Looking around the country, we see only devastation and suffering. Thinking of this, we cannot help but feel heartbroken. Furthermore, our industries are still in their infancy, the people's livelihoods are in decline, and the great powers are watching us, waiting for an opportunity to exploit us. Now that the foundation for unification has just been laid, we need to focus on active construction, and the nation's oppressed must rely on sincere unity. However, recently, rumors and slanders have been spreading, and the situation in Guangdong appears turbulent and uncertain. Considering the future, we cannot help but feel a sense of dread. It is essential to recognize that with foreign threats looming, we cannot afford to engage in internal conflict again. The people cannot bear any more suffering, and we must not allow the nation to be devastated again. We hope that all compatriots across the country will rise up to support the Central Government and advocate for peace. This would be a great blessing for our people and our nation.</p>
<p>Shanghai Special Municipality Eighth District Party Headquarters</p>
<h3 id="e4">Telegram from the Sixth District Party Headquarters <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Omissions) The successful path for national revolution lies only in construction, not destruction; the sole condition for national survival lies only in unity, not division. Therefore, our greatest need at present is not the continuation of military achievements amidst the rain of bullets, but rather a period of recuperation and rehabilitation, a time for the people to recover and rebuild under political tutelage. Unexpectedly, this desire for peace, shared by all 400 million compatriots, was shattered by unfortunate events that occurred during a period of supposed freedom of action for a few petty individuals. Perhaps this was driven by the ambitions of local warlords. However, after expending countless amounts of blood and sacrificing countless lives, we finally obtained this glimmer of hope that is the Republic of China. Unless one is insane or willing to be enslaved, one would not dare to resort to military force or disrupt the peace. Yet the reality is that our expectations have been betrayed. Every time we recall this, our blood boils with anger. Therefore, I say that Deng Zeru, Gu Yingfen, and others are not merely harboring sinister intentions, but are also destroying the life of the Chinese nation. Chen Jitang, who is fond of chaos, is not merely a criminal eager to lead troops, but also a willing accomplice ready to sell out the Republic of China, becoming the next Li Wan Yong or Chen Jiongming. We, standing for the interests of the entire nation, absolutely cannot allow such a group of demons to exist. Therefore, at this final moment, I still hope that they will turn back from the brink and awaken to the truth, so that the storm clouds of war can be transformed into the peaceful colors of a white flag. That would be the act of a great man who is courageous in correcting his mistakes and wise in understanding the situation. If our earnest pleas are not enough to restrain the desire for leadership of these petty clowns, then we can only appeal to the Central Government to suppress the rebellion and unite the people to eliminate these traitors, so as to fulfill the final instructions of our late Premier for peace and national salvation.</p>
<p>Chinese Kuomintang Shanghai Special Municipality Sixth District Executive Committee</p>
<h3 id="e5">Telegram from the Tenth District Party Headquarters <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Omissions) Since the founding of the Republic, twenty years have passed, but turmoil and disorder have continued, and the nation has not had a day of peace. Banditry has been rampant, and the people have been unable to bear it. Fortunately, the domestic warlords have been almost entirely eliminated, and the suppression of bandits in various regions is expected soon. The Central Government, adhering to the teachings of our late Premier, convened the Great National Congress as scheduled, gathered the opinions of the people, and established the fundamental laws of the Party and the nation, hoping for the realization of unity and peace in order to complete the tasks of political tutelage and national construction. However, Deng Zeru, Gu Yingfen, and other comrades picked up rumors and spread false accusations, causing panic throughout the country, and Chen Jitang and others have once again resorted to military force. The news has been particularly shocking. At this time when the people are eagerly hoping for peace and stability, they have disregarded the overall situation and are willing to destroy peace. If Chen and his cohorts can repent, obey the Central Government, safeguard unity, and turn back from the brink, it would not be too late. If they stubbornly act on impulse and disregard what is right, their defeat is imminent. The examples of Feng and other rebels are not far off. Our Association has recently been circulating the messages from comrades across the country urging Chen and others to reconsider, filled with benevolent words and beneficial advice. After admiring these messages, we are sending this telegram in response, hoping that all comrades and compatriots across the country will rise up together to uphold justice, support the Central Government, curb the seeds of chaos, and save the Party and the nation.</p>

Yesterday, he requested the Spanish Vice-Consul in Shanghai, Carrega, to forward a request to the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, asking them to notify the Panchen Lama in advance so that he could arrange to go to Nanjing at a set time.</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Asks for Correction of Heavy Tax on Cotton Yarn</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Consolidated Tax Bureau yesterday, stating: "Regarding the matter of directly addressing you, we received a letter on the 19th of this month from the Shanghai Association of Chaozhou Sugar and Sundry Goods Merchants, stating that our members received a telegram from Shantou stating that cotton yarn shipped to Shantou had already been subject to consolidated tax at the Shanghai Consolidated Tax Bureau upon export. However, after the goods arrived in Shantou, the Consolidated Tax Bureau wanted to collect the tax again. This double taxation is illegal and violates the clear orders of the National Government regarding unified tax rates. We have already sent a letter to the Shanghai Cotton Mill Association, requesting them to seek assistance from the Shanghai Consolidated Tax Bureau. We are now urgently requesting your Chamber to forward a message to the Shanghai Consolidated Tax Bureau to properly address the aftermath of our members' shipments to Shantou, so that the goods can be sold smoothly and avoid heavy taxes, thus maintaining commerce and friendly relations between merchants." After investigation, Article 5 of the Consolidated Tax Regulations states: "Cotton yarn and its directly woven products, as well as matches and cement, which have already been subject to consolidated tax, shall not be subject to any other taxes when transported to various provinces." According to the aforementioned situation, the Shantou Consolidated Tax Bureau is attempting to collect taxes again on goods exported from Shanghai that have already been subject to consolidated tax, which is a violation of regulations and disrupts the consolidated tax system. We are hereby requesting your office to investigate and swiftly order the Shantou Consolidated Tax Bureau to strictly correct this matter in order to uphold the tax system and maintain friendly relations. Respectfully submitted to the Consolidated Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grain Industry Asks for Reduction of Export Tax</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Miscellaneous Grain, Oil, and Oilcake Trade Association sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, stating: "Respectfully submitting this matter, we recently read in the newspaper that the revised Customs Export Tariff stipulates a tax rate of 3.4 mace for rice, an increase of 1.9 mace compared to the previous regular and additional taxes. Sesame is taxed at 4.3 mace, an increase of 2.275 mace, peanuts at 2.9 mace, an increase of 0.065 mace, broad beans and peas at 1.5 mace, an increase of 0.06 mace, and green beans and red beans at 1.8 mace, an increase of 0.09 mace. Considering that rice is related to the people's food supply, it should be allowed to circulate freely within the country, in accordance with the late Premier's instructions to regulate food supplies. The richest rice-producing provinces are Jiangsu, Anhui, Hunan, and Jiangxi, from which rice is exported and sold throughout the north and south, always requiring transshipment. Now that the export tax rate has suddenly increased, merchants will be unable to afford it, which will inevitably lead to sluggish sales. The impact of this will not only harm the people and farmers, but also impact the future of the national food supply. Therefore, the export tax should be reduced. Sesame and peanuts, as well as broad beans, peas, green beans, and red beans, are produced in Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, and Shandong, gathered in Shanghai, and transshipped for export. They have long been needed by foreign countries, and domestic sales are limited, relying mainly on exports. If the government truly wants to support domestic productivity, it should protect and promote these exports. Therefore, the export tax should be reduced to expand national production. Since the end of the European War, commercial warfare has intensified, and almost all countries have paid attention to the progress of international trade. Therefore, they often use the power of the state to support merchants. Looking back at our country, production is lagging, commerce is declining, and most of our needs for clothing, food, housing, and transportation depend on foreign goods. The amount of wealth flowing out of the country each year is huge, amounting to hundreds of millions. Therefore, if domestic products can be exported, they should be encouraged in every way, so that merchants are willing to operate and increase the effectiveness of their foreign trade, thereby compensating for the loss of wealth to some extent. Therefore, the export tax should be reduced to encourage foreign trade. In the newly promulgated Customs Tariff, soybeans maintain the original tax rate, while soybean oil and soybean cake have been reduced. This shows that the government does not want to discourage exports. However, sesame and peanuts are both raw materials for oil production, and their properties and effects are the same. Broad beans and other similar beans are also needed by foreign countries, just like soybeans. However, the tax rates are vastly different, with light and heavy being differentiated. This is too unbalanced. Edible oil and soybean oil both belong to the oil category and should be reduced in accordance with the example of soybean oil. Therefore, the export tax should be reduced to ensure proportionality among similar products. Based on the above four points, for the purpose of circulating domestic rice, supporting farmers' economies, encouraging exports, and increasing the effectiveness of international trade, it is necessary to reduce or exempt taxes. Although the reduction of national tax revenue is minimal, the benefits to farmers and merchants are immeasurable. Therefore, we boldly submit this statement, requesting your Chamber to forward it to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry, so that the above items can be reduced and appropriately revised in order to benefit the national economy and improve the people's livelihoods. We remain respectfully.</p>
<p>All Shanghai Butchers Closed Yesterday</p>
<p>Government Officials State That Discussions Will Resume After Business Resumes</p>
<p>The fresh meat industry in the city has been closed for seven days due to the slaughter tax issue. Butchers in the concessions have all stopped slaughtering starting yesterday and have gone on strike. Colleagues in Zhejiang Province have also telegraphed in response. The details of yesterday's situation are as follows:</p>
<p>Citywide Shutdown</p>
<p>Over 1,400 fresh meat shops in the Public Concession and French Concession, including Lugaoxuan, have unanimously supported the strike. After implementing the cessation of slaughter, the Suxi Slaughterhouse at Dawang Temple slaughtered all its pigs by 2 PM yesterday. The French Municipal Council Slaughterhouse at Nanyang Bridge has also ceased operations. The meat sold by concession butchers today is old meat, and they will go on strike starting tomorrow.</p>
<p>Municipal Government Statement</p>
<p>Yesterday, reporters from various newspapers visited Yu Hongjun, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, regarding the slaughter tax case, asking for his opinion on the butchers' request to change the slaughter tax to a business tax. Yu stated that according to Article 11 of the Supplementary Measures to the Outline of Business Tax Collection in Various Provinces, the Ministry of Finance stipulates that the change from slaughter tax to business tax should be implemented in two steps. The first step is to rename the slaughter tax as a business tax, while the tax rate remains the same as the original slaughter tax rate. The second step is to change the original tax rate to the business tax rate after the business tax is ready. Regardless of whether the business tax has been implemented in this city, even if the business tax is implemented in the future, it must be implemented in stages in accordance with the outline supplement stipulated by the Ministry. Furthermore, Article 5 of the supplementary measures stipulates that the business tax should be paid directly by the taxpayer to the competent authority and must not be contracted or subcontracted by others. The government abolished the contracted donations and still collects them in accordance with the original slaughter tax rate, which is in accordance with the measures stipulated by the Ministry, and there has been no increase in the burden on citizens. The tax rate and tax amount are completely different, so there is no room for misinterpretation. The government is determined to eliminate long-standing malpractices and will only handle matters in accordance with the law. It is hoped that butchers will not be exploited by a few unscrupulous merchants and suffer losses, and it is further hoped that the public will uphold justice.</p>
<p>Zhejiang Merchants Respond</p>
<p>The Fresh Meat Industry Association received a joint telegram from the Meat Industry Associations of 16 locations in Zhejiang Province, including Jiaxing, stating: "Greetings to the Shanghai Fresh Meat Industry Association. Having read in the newspaper that your association is requesting the abolition of the heavy slaughter tax and the change to business tax, but has not received a satisfactory response, resulting in a full shutdown, we cannot help but feel deeply moved. Article 7 of the Outline for the Collection of Business Tax in Various Provinces stipulates that the slaughter tax should be abolished immediately after the establishment of the business tax. Although there are restrictions in Article 11 of the supplementary regulations, the business tax will be temporarily collected at the original tax rate as a transitional measure. However, the second step of the same regulations states that after the business tax is ready, the original tax rate will be changed to the business tax rate to achieve uniformity. Furthermore, the implementation of the business tax in Zhejiang Province has been decided and will be opened within this month, as has been announced. Since the business tax is scheduled to be opened, it is natural that the preparations have already been completed, and the old tax should be abolished and changed to the new tax. This is very clear. Your actions are to relieve the poor of heavy burdens and are worthy of being the leaders of the national meat industry. Our association expresses deep sympathy. In addition to submitting a request to the Zhejiang Provincial Government to transfer to the Ministry of Finance, requesting the abolition of the slaughter tax and the change to the business tax in accordance with the outline of the business tax in order to relieve the people's difficulties, we are also sending this telegram. We hope that you will inform the national meat industry to strive for it together, so that the effort will be halved and the goal will be easily achieved. Local areas are fortunate, and the industry is fortunate.</p>
<p>Jiaxing, Tongxiang, Xincheng, Chongde, Qingzhen, Wuxing, Wuzhen, Shuanglin, Lianshi, Shanlian, Qingshan, Daixi, Mayao, Deqing, Xinshi, Nanxun and other Meat Industry Associations jointly sign"</p>
<p>Intestine Industry Assistance</p>
<p>The Municipal Intestine Industry Association, because it is closely related to the meat industry, is particularly concerned. A special meeting of the Executive Committee was convened yesterday, resolving to send a letter of condolence, expressing assistance, and requesting the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to assist in resolving the issue as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Resolution Path</p>
<p>The meat industry shutdown has now been going on for seven days. Yesterday, a reporter from Xinsheng News inquired with officials and butchers about the resolution of this case. He learned that the butchers could reluctantly agree to the collection of a single layer, but the tax rate was too high to bear. They requested that the authorities understand the difficulties of the merchants and reduce the tax. The charitable undertakings previously undertaken should also be continued by the government. Officials indicated that maintaining charitable undertakings could be allowed. If the butchers agreed to the point calculation, the reduction of the tax rate could also be discussed, but the prerequisite was that business should resume first before other items could be discussed.</p>
<p>A Few Sand and Gravel Businesses Have Resumed Operations</p>
<p>Representatives Will Be Sent to Nanjing to Petition</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of the shutdown of the sand and gravel industry in this city, after receiving instructions from the Ministry of Finance, a small number resumed operations yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Minority Resumption</p>
<p>After the Sand and Gravel Trade Association received instructions from the Ministry of Finance on the previous day, agreeing to revoke the tax, the association's more than 300 members resumed operations yesterday to await resolution. However, over 1,000 non-member businesses have not yet indicated that they will resume operations because the donation tax has not been completely revoked.</p>
<p>Petition to Nanjing</p>
<p>The sand and gravel industry believes that although the Ministry of Finance has instructions to investigate and revoke the tax, it is not a thorough solution. Now that they have been willing to sacrifice and stop business, they must achieve the goal completely before stopping. Therefore, it has been decided to organize a petition group to prepare a document and go to Nanjing to request the Ministry of Finance to implement the cancellation.</p>
<p>General Assembly Resolution</p>
<p>The Sand and Gravel Industry Association convened a general meeting of all members yesterday at 7 PM to discuss the matter of persuading non-members to resume business and requesting Party and government agencies to stop the collection of taxes. The resolutions are as follows: (1) Resolve to order members of the Association to persuade non-members to resume business; (2) Resolve to submit a document to Party and government agencies reporting the resumption of business; (3) Resolve to submit a document to Party and government agencies requesting the cessation of the extortionate sand and mud tax contracted by Dachang Company; (4) Resolve to send Zhou Fengzhang, Li Zefu, Lu Xiaozuo, and Chen Jianqiu to attend the meeting of the Construction Industry Association on May 23rd.</p>
<p>Industry Response</p>
<p>The Shanghai Stone Quarry, Sand, and Gravel Trade Association jointly announced to the industry yesterday, stating: "Since the implementation of the management fee for the collection of yellow sand by the Construction Department of Zhejiang Province, all our sand and gravel industry members have regarded it as the biggest obstacle to our business. At a time when taxes are being cut and reduced, there is still such a policy of exorbitant taxes. The sand and gravel industry must fight to the death to seek a line of life. However, to oppose this management fee, our colleagues should first unite and carefully plan thorough solutions, ensuring that the steps are followed properly and that the workers in the industry and the laborers of the carrying sticks and trucks do not suffer unnecessary losses. This is our humble opinion, and we trust that our colleagues will agree. We hereby inform you and respectfully request your consideration."</p>
<p>Party Department Meeting</p>
<p>The Wusong Eighth District Party Department convened a joint meeting at 2 PM on the 18th of this month for this matter, inviting various help boat households, the Sand Industry Association, and officials from the Construction Department's Sand Transport Order Office. Xu Yifei, the representative of the office, explained the process of handling the matter according to the order, and the help boat households reported on the oppression they have suffered from brokers (i.e., the Sand Industry Association) over the years. It was said that the yellow sand used for construction in Shanghai is produced in various coastal areas of Zhejiang Province. The sand has traditionally been purchased from landlords and transported to Shanghai for sale by the help boat households. However, the boat households rely on physical labor, and after their sand boats arrive in Shanghai, they are eager to return for loading and transportation in order to maintain their livelihoods, so they cannot stay in Shanghai for a long time to wait for sales. Brokers take advantage of this weakness, using their monopolistic methods to deduct tonnage and reduce prices, doing everything they can to exploit them. They also know that the boat households are short of capital, so they use a small amount of money as a tool to coerce them, preventing the boat households from selling freely forever. The boat households have suffered this oppression for many years and have been unable to find a way to eliminate it. Now that the landlords in various production areas have formed the Yitai Company to sell their own sand, they are giving the boat households preferential water feet (transportation fees) and valuing the sand by the ton so that they do not suffer losses. When the boat households heard this news, they all celebrated and transported the sand for sale. As a result, they incurred the jealousy of the brokers, who did not hesitate to use various means to disrupt the situation. On one hand, they gathered people to create disturbances under the pretext of collecting management fees, and even hired gangsters to prevent sand boats from entering the port. The boat households stated that if they did not lose anything in the water feet after paying the management fees, they would not resist in any way and would not be used by anyone to request the maintenance of the regulations. After hearing the explanations of the office representative and various help boat households, the Eighth District Party Department also expressed deep understanding. The brokers of the Sand Industry Association had nothing to say. The Eighth District Party Department has clearly understood the truth and has ignored the unreasonable demands of the Sand Industry Association.</p>
<p>Barge Industry News</p>
<p>On the 19th, the Shanghai Coal and Stone Barge Industry Association received reports from members such as Zhu Tongfu of the Xiejin Barge Transportation Company, stating that all stone boats imported from Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, Wuxi, etc., were stopped at the docks and could not unload their goods, resulting in huge losses every day, and requested speedy relief. After receiving the report, the Association noted that coal boats were transporting as usual, supplying the needs of various transportation agencies, and there were no obstacles to uploading or unloading. They wondered why the stone boats could not unload their cargo after arriving in Shanghai. They immediately sent personnel to investigate various docks and found that the coolies on the docks were on strike, so the imported stone boats were unable to unload their cargo. In addition to requesting compensation from various brokers for all losses incurred by the boat households, the Association has informed all members.</p>
<p>County Clearing Bureau Ends as Scheduled</p>
<p>Meeting Scheduled to Discuss on the 25th</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Shanghai County Clearing Bureau has reached its three-month limit at the end of this month. All important tasks, such as investigating households, inspecting ships, and inspecting self-defense firearms, have been completed in order. Therefore, Director Yan ordered the end of the clearing on schedule and specially scheduled a meeting for the district and sub-bureau directors at 2 PM on the 25th of this month (Monday) to discuss the end of the clearing. Yesterday, letters were sent to the sub-bureau directors, requesting them to attend the meeting at that time and to prepare a report on matters that have not been completed and should be continued, and to submit it to the meeting for joint discussion. There should be no delay.</p>
<p>Ningbo Association Promotes Telephone Line Between Shanghai and Ningbo</p>
<p>In order to promote the telephone line between Shanghai and Ningbo, the Ningbo Association in Shanghai sent a telegram to the Ministry of Communications, requesting its speedy implementation. The original telegram is recorded below:</p>
<p>"To Minister Wang of the Ministry of Communications in Nanjing,</p>
<p>The telephone business is a powerful tool for developing communications. Since the Hangzhou-Ningbo line was connected, the business community has been eagerly looking forward to the connection and call between Shanghai and Ningbo. Our Association has been repeatedly urged by fellow villagers. In order to facilitate public transportation, we are not prepared to withhold the news. Therefore, we are sending this telegram to request your Ministry to adopt this proposal and promptly connect the line for calling in order to facilitate business information. We also hope to receive a reply.</p>

<p>Japanese Tourist Groups Arrive in China One After Another</p>

<p>Guanghua Factory Labor Dispute Resolved</p>
<p>The Bureau of Social Affairs mediated a dispute involving Gu Yongjing, the manager of the silk-finishing office affiliated with the municipal dyeing industry union, and the Guanghua factory. Gu Yongjing had dismissed workers for no reason, causing resentment between labor and management, which nearly led to a strike. Yesterday, the Bureau of Social Affairs conducted a second mediation. At 1 PM, both sides were summoned for questioning. Xu Zhi, the chairman of the Second Section, attended, as well as Zhou Jinji and two others representing the labor side, and Gu Yongquan and two others representing the management side. As a result, three conditions were agreed upon: (1) The factory is willing to allow Xu Guangsheng to return to work. (2) Xu Guangsheng tore up the notice. The management will give him a demerit, taking into account the circumstances. (3) Xu Guangsheng acted improperly. He will write a letter of repentance to the factory and will work peacefully in the future. Thus, a storm was calmed.</p>
<p>Printing Workers' Wage Increase Movement</p>
<p>The wage increase movement of printing workers in this city is very tense. In recent days, over thirty factories, with more than 1,200 workers, have been asking the industry union (referring to the typesetting industry union) to promptly propose revisions to the treatment contract and increase wages. They are also voluntarily raising funds to strengthen the union's financial backing. Details of some of their demands are as follows: generally, each worker is requesting a monthly wage increase of four yuan, the employer must subsidize the workers' housing costs by four yuan per person per month, implement an eight-hour workday, and request the establishment of a school for printing workers' children. There are over twenty other demands, which are difficult to describe in detail. Over ten more factories are joining. If an accident occurs, public security will inevitably be greatly affected. It is now known that the Shanghai Typesetting Industry Union is convening meetings of cadres in various districts to discuss the direction of action in order to cope with the demands of the workers, so as to persuade and enlighten them. The general idea is to unite, wait for the union to submit a request to the higher authorities for legal action, and for workers in each factory to strictly obey discipline in order to maintain public security and not be exploited by reactionary elements,</p>

<p>Commercial News: The financial and gold markets are extremely chaotic, with storms frequently seen. Yesterday, the 21st, the gold market's situation was chaotic, with huge waves that were impossible to suppress. From morning to evening, there were more than eleven taels of fluctuations. In the end, it broke even. Transactions among colleagues were extremely disorganized. As for the silver market, it reported gains, but opened with a low trading price. Afterwards, news from foreign silver markets was divided, so there were fluctuations of more than ten taels. People were extremely anxious. At one point, it broke through the 780 tael mark. However, as foreign exchange rates slightly improved, the trend seemed to contract. The listed price did not change. There were telegrams from India for purchases. Afterwards, the market remained in a state of confusion, with fluctuations of four to five taels. However, the exchange rate remained stable. Later, the trend eased, with the view that large amounts would rise again within 77 taels. There were fluctuations of more than ten taels.

Subsequently, it increased by 1.34 taels. However, it immediately fell to 71.5 taels due to selling by Yuan Mao, Yong Chang, Sheng Yong, and speculator Mr. Wu, etc. Suddenly, news came that India was buying British gold. As a result, Sanling Zhengjin and Mitsui, etc., sold June contracts, totaling 1275, so it rose to 74.9 taels. Subsequently, there were fluctuations of 1 or 2 taels, from 73 to 4.5 taels.

In addition, Yuan Mao, Yong Fu Yu, and speculators actively purchased, so the price jumped by more than eight taels, suddenly breaking through 80 taels, reaching 82.5 taels at 10:10, almost with the feeling of flying high. Afterwards, Mr. Wu, Yuan Mao, Yong Chang, Sheng Yong, Yuan Kang, Xiang Yong, Feng Fu Chang, and Xin Heng, etc., jointly sold off. In addition, due to the fact that the United States had just sold silver, it was a mistake to purchase, so British gold relaxed again, closing at 6875. Banks had bought 18125. As a result, the gold market rapidly declined, falling by more than 11 taels. At 11:10, it finally reached 71 taels. Because retail investors chased after it, it rose by 4 taels. At noon, it was 5.23 taels. At noon closing, it was 74 taels. Afterwards, it was flat, within 4 taels. The quoted price was still 811.8 taels, a decrease of 37 to 38 taels, to around 30 taels.

Heng Xing, Yuan Kang, Xiang Yu Da, etc., purchased, increasing to 76.5 taels, then suppressing it to 4.78 taels. After 2:30, the buying side was quite strong. Run Chang, Yu Zhi Feng, Yong Yuan Kang, Xiang, etc., all started to purchase. As for the exchange rate, it was stable. HSBC offered 6875, and Guang Bang, etc., all had closing purchases, causing the gold price to rise sharply by 4 taels. Around 4:00, the Indian exchange rate reported a small increase of three annas, rising to 79.2 taels at the time. Suddenly, Qian Chang, Xiang Yi Feng, Yong Fu Chang, etc., suddenly came to sell, reaching 74.7 taels at 4:20. Then, it was pulled up by two taels, as retail investors made up for it. As for British gold, it was available for purchase and sale at 6875. At 4:30 closing, it was 76.9 taels, only an increase of one cent compared to the day before yesterday. The maximum price for the day was 82.5 taels, and the minimum price was 71 taels, a difference of 11.5 taels. The price of goods in the morning market was 74 taels, noon closing was 3.8 taels, the afternoon was 4.5 taels, and the closing price was 6.5 cents.

Guang Bang was watching in the morning market, and had a total of more than 400 transactions in the afternoon market. Foreign exchange situation is complicated. Gold Businesses Mostly Buying, Less Selling. Yesterday, the British, American, and Indian silver markets all saw increases, with generally more buying than selling. As for the Shanghai market, HSBC's listed price did not change, but the domestic market slightly fluctuated, initially showing looseness, then tightening, and then loosening again, so the gold market was extremely chaotic, with fluctuations of 780 taels. In the afternoon, it was flat. Compared to the morning before, British gold increased by 0.0625, American gold by 0.125, and Japanese gold decreased by 0.0125.

Yesterday, only the 1929 customs bond was traded in the morning in the spot market. The futures market was more prosperous than before. Due to time constraints, the closing auction was temporarily held. In the morning auction, the prices fluctuated. In the second auction, the buying side was strong. In the final auction, the market demand was still strong, and the price continued to rise. However, as the supply gradually leveled off, it slightly eased. As a result, only the May Reorganization bond rose by 2 yuan. The 1929 customs spot also rose by 1 yuan and 1 jiao. Other bonds also rose slightly, but only by about 2 or 3 jiao. Total spot market transactions for the day were only 1,000 yuan, while futures market transactions reached more than 14 million in the morning and more than 8 million in the afternoon.</p>

Yarn and Cotton Market Stable. The yarn market trend is firm, with a relatively strong situation. The current yarn sales are still good, and the exchange rate has shrunk significantly. Rumors about the current situation have calmed down slightly, and American cotton has also turned to an upward trend, causing retail investors to buy in, and people are determined. A certain merchant is expected to receive a huge amount of 13,000 bales this month. The delivery items are mostly 10-count Red Lotus Bee, accounting for about 4,000 to 5,000 bales. The rest are also coarse yarns, but generally retail investors have not completely given up their plans to sell short due to the chaotic current situation, and the pressure is still heavy. There are still many who sell short when the price rises. However, judging from the overall situation, although there is no actively rising trend temporarily, it is difficult to find a sharp drop. If the Guangdong political situation does not change and the import tax is settled, there will be a large number of coarse yarn businesses, because they have not been purchased this year, and there will naturally be great hope in the future. As the exchange rate does not increase, not only can overseas goods not be shipped in, but there are exports, so in comparison, the market is quite likely to be consolidated.</p>
<p>Human Label Situation is Better. The human label market opened higher in the morning, because American cotton turned to an upward trend and large households bought in, and the market atmosphere tightened. All months increased by 28 qian to 1.23 taels. In the afternoon, short sellers continued to sell, and the pressure was still heavy. Each month fell by 3, 4, or 5 qian. Transactions totaled 33,100 bales. It was found that Rongxing sold 2,450 bales, Yida 1,000 bales, Yiyu 1,950 bales, and Xiesheng 1,750 bales. Heshen bought 2,000 bales, Gengfeng 3,800 bales, Taixing 1,000 bales, Rongxing 1,350 bales, Tiancheng 1,000 bales, Yichang 1,000 bales, and Changfeng 1,100 bales.

Cotton Market Has No Major Changes.</p>
<p>The cotton market is calm, but American cotton has fallen for nine consecutive days and is now rebounding. However, the market atmosphere is bland, rising and falling again. Because Japanese merchants do not intend to take delivery this month, the delivery is sufficient. However, the exchange rate is still firm, and new sellers have not been very enthusiastic. Han Label Stabilizes. The Han Label market opened lower in the morning. There were more sellers this month, down 3 qian. The second and third auctions rose due to the good yarn market. As a result, it increased by 2 or 3 qian. It fell slightly in the afternoon. This month, it fell by 4 qian. The far-term fell by 5 fen to 2.5 qian. Transactions totaled 63,400 dan. It was found that Yiyu sold 3,500 dan, Shenxin 2,100 dan, and Xincheng 1,600 dan. Changfeng bought 4,500 dan, Jifeng 1,600 dan, and Tongxing 1,400 dan. The closing prices are recorded below.</p>

Current Demand is Extremely Weak. Current cotton business is flat. Yao Cotton: 35.80. Guangdong Purchase: 300 Bales. Consistent Rebound in Stacked and Foreign Cotton.</p>
<p>American Cotton Rebounds Due to Short Covering. Yesterday, American cotton was initially firm due to good news from Liverpool, but then weakened due to weakness in Wall Street. Finally, it rose again due to short covering by short sellers. Futures rose by 17 to 21 points, and spot prices rose by 20 points. British cotton futures rose by 2 points, and spot prices were unchanged. Egyptian cotton spot prices were unchanged. Indian cotton was firm due to purchases by European exporters. Pygout Oumra and Bairoxi all rose by 2 rupees. The original telegram is recorded below. (20th Telegram)</p>

<p>Grain and Foreign Rice Sales are Slow and Prices are Falling. Yesterday's customer rice market was halted, and the market immediately became sluggish. Although there were contacts for 300 bags of Jiangxi machine late rice in the morning, the price was not right in the afternoon and it was withdrawn. Therefore, there were no transactions in the whole city, because the arrival of rice from the river is strong, and the source can be expected to be more abundant after the weather clears. Therefore, this street has refocused on the rice and rice from the river, and no longer asks about the customer rice. Customer yuan rice was handled by Xiamen gang to Jiangxi second machine yuan rice 200 bags, the price was 12 yuan 5 jiao half. As for foreign rice, no one in this street paid attention because there was a lot of Dumi rice arriving. Foreign companies did not open. Huilong goods opened Min Dang 100 tons in June, the price was 5 taels 5 qian 3 fen, which was 2 fen less than the previous market. Flour prices stabilized due to the weather turning stable.</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after the opening in the morning, although the quotation of foreign wheat was good for about 2 or 3 jiao in each month's market, the inland gang's thinking was slightly relaxed because the weather had cleared, and the market saw fatigue and decline in each month because of the return of floating profits. The closing price was about 1 fen lower than the previous day. Until the opening in the afternoon, because the weather was hot and stuffy, and everyone was afraid of a downpour, the market still rose. Judging from the situation after this, it seems that there is a flood in all places because the rainfall is too sufficient. At this time, when the new wheat will come to the market, there must be clear weather to save it, otherwise it will be difficult for people to calm down. As a result, May, June and July were slightly better than before 2 li half, September was better 2 li half, and August and October were unchanged. Period Wheat's Later Market Turns Good.</p>
<p>Yesterday's period wheat market, after the opening in the morning, each month's market had a hovering trend. Because the weather had turned fine, the inland gang's office stomachs were slightly advanced, or they were engaged in returning goods, so the softest time was about 2 or 3 points less than the previous day. Until the opening in the afternoon, because the decline in the flour market was not much, and there were few sellers, the market's needs were still dominated by bulls, so the bids in each month were also good. Judging from this, if the pricing of foreign wheat is appropriate, it can ease people's hearts, otherwise it will be difficult to return to low prices for the time being. As a result, this month was 1 fen better than the previous day, June was 5 fen better, July was 3 fen better, August was 5 fen better, September was 3 fen better, and October was 5 fen better.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea Foreign Firm Silk Market Has Little Vitality. In the European and American markets, the price of Japanese silk is cheap, and the progress of Chinese silk factories is slow and stagnant. Prices have fallen sharply, especially in Shanghai factories. The market atmosphere is depressed. Yesterday, only Hexing purchased ten packages of Sichuan yellow factory silk, and Xin Shichang purchased ten packages of Bai Gan factory silk. Prices are trending down. Shaoxing High-Quality Cocoons are Scarce and Prices are Rising Sharply. Cocoon production only accounts for 30%... High-quality cocoons open at 52 yuan.</p>
<p>This year's early silkworms in Shaoxing's various cities and villages were frozen to death during the first sleep. During the late silkworm's major sleep, heavy rains and cold weather caused 40% to 50% of the silkworms to die of jaundice and stiff death. After being put on the wicker frames, they suffered from severe cold winds and sand. Cocoon production is very scarce. New cocoons have been listed on the market. The total harvest is only about 30%. Only 24 cocoon firms have opened scales in the entire county. The scales have been opened for three or four days, and the goods arriving on the market are few, and the cocoons are thin and of poor quality. Very few high-quality cocoons. The price of cocoons has risen sharply. The price of improved varieties of high-quality goods has risen to 52 yuan. Each firm's collection is very limited.</p>
<p>Qi Tea Transactions Exceed 4,000 Boxes. Yesterday's tea market in the foreign firms in this port, English firms were very interested in purchasing Qimen upper and middle grade black tea, and German and French firms also started searching and purchasing. The market turned firm. Transactions in the city for Qi tea from various routes reached 4,717 boxes. The top board still opened at 360 taels. Chinese tea merchants, in view of the shortage of production this year and the large sales in England, people's hearts turned firm again, so yesterday's market was unchanged from the previous day.</p>
<p>Suian Zhenmei Tea Has Arrived in Shanghai. More than 400 boxes of Zhejiang's Suian green tea have been transported from Hangzhou by Yongxinglong and Gong Shengyong tea warehouses yesterday, and samples will be available today. News from Wuyuan Tea.</p>
<p>Few Scales Opened. New tea from Wuyuan's various villages has been negotiated by tea houses for days. Mountain households are separated from the too harsh sale prices, which are far from covering costs, and they insist on not giving in. Except for the two places in Yintai Liujiaxia that opened scales yesterday, only one place, Chamuqiao, opened scales today. The board price is still 40 yuan, no higher or lower than yesterday's market. New tea in the Xilu Shicen, Yantian, and Huchuan areas is still being negotiated, but the sale price is only 30 yuan and has not yet been agreed upon. Judging from the stalemate between the firms and households, it seems difficult to achieve large-scale openings for a while.</p>
<p>Silver is Extremely Tight. In previous years, the various tea funds of this county were obtained from Yueping, Jingdezhen, and Tunxi in addition to the merchants' supply, so the silver situation was still flexible. This year, none of the tea funds of the various firms are prepared. The tea warehouses stationed in Wuyuan only lend to those who have capital and have not controlled the warehouse funds. Even the firms with tickets and capital are afraid of the danger of transporting cash from afar due to the rampant bandits. The only source of cash is the assistance of merchants in this county. However, the business of shops this year has been greatly declining, and the amount of funds released is small. Recently, the ticket price has increased from 1,370 yuan per thousand taels to 1,330 yuan, and there is still a market but no funds to exchange. The extreme tightness of silver is rare.</p>
<p>Mountain Households are Suffering Losses. This county has more mountains than fields, and tea production is the bulk. The livelihood of farmers throughout the year also relies on the income from tea prices. This year's tea leaves were picked early and the labor force was short, resulting in a strange shortage of harvest. According to tea households in various villages, those who produced one dan of tea in previous years only produced 40 to 50 jin of tea this year. Compared with previous years, the harvest has been reduced by 70%, 60%, 50%, and 40%. It is estimated that the total output of the county this year must be discounted by at least half. In addition, the mountain price is harsh and small, and the loss of harvest and price has left tea households wanting to cry without tears.
