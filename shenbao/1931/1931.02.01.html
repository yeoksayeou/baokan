<h3>美民主黨之哀的美敦書</h3>
<p>美國政黨與政府間所以鮮有劇烈之衝突者以之共和與民主兩大政黨之主張要本上旣無大相反對之處政策亦大同小異且此兩大政黨皆與政治家資本家之要人有相聯係而總統可以調和維擊於其間帮兩黨雖偶有意見上之争執而恒能消弭於無形總之勢力亦因之而無損也兩黨政策所以略有分别者因共和黨員向以東北實業之區爲肆據地民主黨則以</p>
<p>南方農業之區爲多帮共和黨之政策在注重工商實業以開發財源民主黨之政策在注重民以發展農利爲先因此兩黨在議會中不免時起齟齬但以工商業正在興盛猛進之際農民方面雖稍受壓近而因經濟力尙充未感若何苦痛也今自工商業衰落而後國内經濟形勢頓然改變農民因受災失</p>
<p>業之影響生活愈感困難胡佛總統又未能實踐救濟農業之宣言感情因之愈壞試觀今日電訊民主黨爲賑濟災農事對胡佛提出衰的美敦式之連名呈文措詞異常嚴峻不啻表示與共和黨宣戰之意竊恐此問題未能如從前各問題之容易消弭而美議會亦將一變而爲多事之議會矣</p>

<h3>鄭鍚棠勇猛　格鬭綁匪</h3>
<p>奪下匪之手槍</p>
<p>擲入黄浦江中</p>
<p>兩匪逃一匪獲</p>
<p>車夫嫌疑被扣</p>
<p>昨日上午十一時許南市滬軍營機廠街發生劇盜圖綁未遂等被綁者爲北京路老公茂内河輪船局之總經理甬人鄭錫棠氏結果鄭當塲逃脫倖免一匪中彈被擒茲將詳細情形探錄於次</p>
<p>鄭錫棠行止不定　甬籍鉅商鄭錫棠（一字華堂）年三十八歲現任公共租界北京路一七八號老公茂内河輪船局及南市外灘七十八號平安輪船公司總經理職惟老公茂設有船塢廠於浦東白蓮涇老擺渡附近故鄭住址無定或住船塢廠或居北京路有時竟下榻於長子處鄭共有二子長名晉臣（字肇九）年二十三歲襄助乃父辦理各處事宜現住南市方浜橋幼子僅二歲名亦臣尙在襁褓</p>
<p>孫女曾一度被綁鄭因職務冗繁故自備汽車一輛以代步更因地位關係舉止未免闊綽致爲匪徒所垂涎去歲春間鄭之長子肇九及孫女否娟曾在南　　家闕路務本女學門首遇險一次</p>
<p>結果其子因身體敏捷逃入校内得免僅將其孫女杏娟綁去終至備欵贖還詎未及一載匪徒又垂涎鄭之本人</p>
<p>昨日中午來浦西　鄭自孫女被綁後爲防範未然計陸續雇用保鏢者兩名各備手槍以防萬一昨日上午十時左右鄭至北京路辦公畢即過浦至老擺渡船塢視察臨行時僅带保鏢王玉生（天津人年二十六歲雇用已近兩載）一人隨過浦視察畢行至十一時許擬返浦西至平安輪船公司午餐遂臨時雇一舢舨偕保鏢者渡至浦西在南碼頭機廠街碼頭登岸</p>
<p>路旁竄出三綁匪　舢舨泊定後鄭·王·一齊登陸王在前行鄭隨其後詎方離碼頭約百步之遙行抵材料堆棧附近突由路旁竄出綁匪三人兩匪先將王玉生攔阻出槍嚇禁聲張並將王身畔所佩之第三四九二三號自衛手槍奪去當時鄭距離僅十餘步相近睹狀明知遇匪乃亟返身向浦邉奔逃以冀再乘原有舢舨圖遁</p>
<p>鄭滑倒綁匪開槍保鑣者被兩匪監視已完全失去抵抗力佇立江干静候處置詎另一匪暼見肉票返身圖逃乃拔槍在後緊追不料鄭方奔抵碼頭正擬拾級而下而當時適值微雨滿地泥汚濕滑異常倉皇間忽滑仆於地該匪見其倒踣遂向其轟擊一槍彈中左手袖口射穿一洞彈珠落於鄭之身畔黄色紙簿上故皮膚毫未受傷</p>
<p>奪匪槍奮勇角鬥　鄭見該匪</p>
<p>開槍乃情急躍起向該匪猛撲吊住該匪兩手竟將匪之手槍奪下順手一抛槍適墮落浦邊泥汚中鄭見匪去手槍膽乃益壯遂奮力與匪角鬥而同時岸上監視保鑣者之兩匪突聞槍聲知事不妙乃舍王奔人預停道旁之篷式汽車中開足速率風馳電掣而去</p>
<p>綁匪故作鎭静態　當兩匪方登入車中呼捕之聲大作附近某廠請願警士金禹九聞警執槍趕出距離汽車五十步之遙先認明汽車號碼並同時開槍射擊奈車行過速追已不及而其時追鄭之匪見汽車去遠無法逃遁乃故示鎭静將兩手插在大衣袋内佯作取槍態度從容前進不料保鑣者在旁觀察異常清晰乃暗尾其後以待相當地點以擒之</p>
<p>綁匪終於被截獲　王暗隨該匪約數十武適遇警士金禹九兩人乃一齊上前將其截獲而同時二區總署高昌廟分駐所巡官高鴻賓業已聞警率警赶到先將該匪拘解到所再至江邊檢查一過果將匪棄下之手槍尋獲槍之號碼爲八六五六二號高巡官查畢乃將鄭·王·兩人一齊带所詳詢當時經過並一面用電話報告二區總署</p>
<p>盧家灣發現汽車　當時據王玉生及警士金禹九報稱匪之汽車爲篷式白牌營業汽車號碼爲一七九六三號（市八八五號）但真僞不及細辨隨由王區長亟派偵緝員曹鈞逹分乘機器脚踏車四處兜捕詎巡至盧家灣法總捕房門口果見該號汽車停於路隅遂入捕房陳述詎該車之汽車夫已先往捕房報告矣</p>
<p>綁匪租車之情形　曹偵緝員遂向捕房陳明情形捕頭隨將車夫連同汽車交與該員直接带至二區總署經王區長詳審一過汽車夫供名吴根友年三十三歲浙江慈谿人現在有恒路二號興華汽車公司爲汽車夫今晨（昨晨）八時許忽來一西服年約三十餘歲之雇客謂須雇車一輛專往各處有事租金以每小時三元計算賬房遂命我開出第一七六九三號雪佛萊蓬車一輛</p>
<p>約定等候一小時　最初先將車開至法租界南陽橋平濟利路相近停車又有一着西裝·一御中山服·兩人上車命開往北京路車抵北京路山西路南首某弄口又命停車三人乃一齊下車入弄約隔半小時三人又復行上車遂命開往十六舖滬軍營停在機廠街一小碼頭附近一西裝者向余云我等須過浦有事約一小時方回命在彼處守候</p>
<p>在福開森路逃走　詎未及半小時西裝者兩人忽然怱怱奔入車中袖出手槍命余開足速率向前直駛余當時脅於淫威祗得唯命是從詎車行約五十步即聞後面槍聲一響呼盜之聲大作至於車中这匪是否還槍當時因驚悸萬分未能細辨嗣後車經斜橋折人法租界從徐家匯路至盧家灣一直至霞飛路向西抵福開森路附近即命停車兩匪乃下車逃遁余乃將車開至盧家灣報告云云</p>
<p>擒獲之匪已受傷　王區長訊畢以該車夫爲綁匪開車逹數小時之久竟毫無所覺尤以車抵機廠街碼頭時匪徒對渠聲稱過浦須一小時之久命彼稍待且車資分文未給該車夫竟貿然允許實足滋人疑慮遂命暫押候查訊畢復命提截獲之匪詎該匪下顎已被槍擊成一洞穿過右頸下齒擊落兩枚血流如注絲毫不能言語王區長無奈祗得暫命收押候傷愈再訊但該匪究屬爲何人擊傷尚未能查明云</p>

<h3>曁南球足真茹球籃隊征菲記（五）</h3>
<p>（本報記者文初於一月二十六日寄自馬尼拉）</p>
<p>（一）足球勝聯合隊</p>
<p>丨第四次比賽丨</p>
<p>三與一之比</p>
<p>昨（二十四日）爲籃球傪敗之日羣衆感覺不快幸今（二十五日下午四時半）足球比賽又以三與一之比戰勝英西美菲各國阰合隊則足球錦標已屬我有（共有五場比賽一塲對和三塲大勝）亦可洗昨夜慘敗受盡外人呐喊之譏矣</p>
<h3>國勢影響體育</h3>
<p>在未比賽之前在塲中先有英國海軍足球隊與先迷撈大學隊比賽亦有一塲　争虎門但因觀</p>
<p>衆不注意遂覺力不討好故塲中亦無若何彩擊其結果篇二與一之比英海軍勝此中有一事耐人尋味者即英人之氣宇昂自誇爲大一等國民且足球爲其發源地無異家常便飯大有目無餘子之概且個個身體雄壯益覺糾糾可畏在菲人則自視爲弱小民旅故異常謹畏全不敢有越軌行動紙有奮勇抵禦全不見猛烈反攻此國勢强弱情形亦影響於運動場上在觀衆有同一不快之感想也</p>
<h3>陳鎭和立首功</h3>
<p>時間旣到我方對日而陣其地勢旣遜一籌兩軍交綏後敵方來勢甚猛即竭力進攻有一二次險球皆爲我方二衛救出由是前鋒五虎奮起神威直摀敵境黑將軍陳鎭和神脚一揮對準敵門打進於羣衆歡呼中記功第一次</p>
<h3>戴中鋒再破敵</h3>
<p>我方旣得一球聲勢益壯後衛馬二將軍與江善敬策應有方不使境内稍留敵蹤前鋒中鋒盘出應敵戴中鋒又奮通争先再打進　一球　比距開戰紙十分鐘也</p>
<p>敵方亦奮勇直追屢次進攻但球入我界内即被後挑出而我軍前鋒五虎屢在敵域外示威連進攻數次終以敵方抵禦得法故上半場紙成爲二與○之比</p>
<h3>敵幸未吃鴨蛋</h3>
<p>下半場開戰我軍更爲數度熱烈進攻一次戴中鋒得左翼之傳遞與黑將軍兼程并進敵方救援馳至戴中鋒至此反用軟工夫將球輕輕從右方挑人而羅家將即由是受傷矣幸回寓時已能照常行動矣</p>
<p>下半場竸争更爲劇烈敵方拚命欲打破鷄蛋記　争　　　　　故對　　　　　　不　　最終被其踼進一球成爲三與○之比我方遂大告特勝</p>

<p>真茹先中一球</p>
<p>評判員笛聲一響兩軍即擺列陳勢敵方左衛即犯規罰球黄兆霖擲籃不中球遂在兩軍手中輾轉經還我方左鋒蔡榮瑞忽奪得敵球急傅與右衛孔廣益孔即遠射人　我方遂先開二分新紀錄</p>

<p>敵方見被我方開新紀錄大奮精神左鋒在近籃打進一球隨又罰進一球遂反以三比二佔先從此我方步步落後漸成十二與二之比惱得楊家將（麟毓）带病出戰使黄老將略事休息我方士氣爲之一振無如敵方隨即回敬分數又增至二十比四未幾兩方所得分數成三與一之比例即二十四對八敵方旣勝大有左右逢源之勢擅用右手遠射之左鋒又打進一球雖魏文長莽將軍亦因兩次罰球而命中然敵方藉罰球又增一分李誠元本带病在旁參觀見我軍失敗勉强加人作戰黄老將得其傅遞再進二分而李以傷痛難支仍由魏代上半場結果敵方遂以二十七比十二勝我方</p>
<h3>我方反攻無效</h3>
<p>敵方戰功扶遙直上佈告牌下之寫手幾於手不停揮我方雖屢次有得球在手機會逮射近攻皆不能命中至四十一對十六時氣得黄老將虎目横豎奮勇奪得一球急傅與蔡從左射人再得二分而敵方一時分數又增加五分成爲四十六對十八張翼德在場中獲得一球急傅之魏魏傳之蔡其傅法大有精采再打進一球軍心再爲之一振　爲最後挣扎無如敵方大得倖運再進一球又罰一球至是我方僅得二十分敵方經增至四十九矣我軍經此敗創雖抱破釜沉舟之志無如敵方旣估勝着身體　活視線又確不期皆手到功成故最後二分鐘間被其一攻再攻連進丑球故完塲時成爲五十九對二十二大勝真茹隊</p>
<p>真茹失敗原因</p>
<p>如老將黄漢升第一次之功績爲中外人所共見乃因天氣關係此一二日來身體欠佳遂稍歲祺　　　　　　軍而此　　　　　　　崦敵方戰術巧妙手叚靈敏實爲我方所不及此爲觀衆公認即其跳高急跑傳遞射擊亦花樣百出大足令觀者目眩五色令戰方應接不暇此爲制勝最大原因而我方射投皆不準確心慌手浮故屢有　球機會而遠射近攻皆不能命中連數次罰球亦皆不能人籃雖然勝敗固常事如能探人之長以補我短將來自可反敗爲勝矣</p>

<h3>巴黎物語（二）（○）</h3>
<p>六會寄於巴黎</p>
<p>說了半天我不過狠空泛的說着聖母院的外貎現在再說說聖母院在美術史上的價值罷我在上面不是說過聖母院建於一一六三年嗎但偌大的聖母院並不是一下建成的它是一一六三年開始的全部建築的完成却在十一世紀中頁當聖母院建築之始正是傳統的羅馬風建築漸衰新的奇特式Ｓtylegothiue建築起而代之的時候聖母院旣是今天建築這一部份明天建</p>
<p>築那一部份在這時代裹面一串連續完成的工作於是哥特式發逹的形跡都保存在這建築物裡面因此巴黎聖母院不但是現在研究哥特式建築的一個最好模型並且可双把它做一部從十二世紀到丨四世紀的法蘭西建築發逹史看</p>
<p>現在去遊聖母院的走近正面最先觸目的就是這建築物上裝飾的豊當墻頭星角無一處不嵌着精美的彫刻聖母院正央有三個弓形的大鬥每張鬥的周園就不知有多少彫像那些彫像部大多代表着宗教上的故事三張鬥上又有一個Galeriedesroiso那上面列着古猶太和綺色列的二十八個國王的像再上面是長長的一條闌干上面也點綴着彫刻虫間是聖母和兩個天使右邊是亞當左邊是夏娃這兩個赤身男女是從樂園逐出的人類的祖宗想矣誰都知道的闌干後面有一個極大而又彫鏤得極精緻的蓄微形玻璃窗這破璃窗呌做Roseo這是每個天主教堂都少不了的再上去又是一條柱廊連貫着兩座方形高塔從底下看來好像菲常脆弱非常危險的樣子其實這柱廊却很堅實上面可以供人往來奔走</p>

<h3>兒童藝術教育</h3>
<p>葉秋原</p>
<p>不久之前在某處電影院看見關於墨西哥的兒童彫刻院底影片在那里有許多兒童各依其興之所到爲各式的彫刻有的用了活的猴子或是猫狗做他們的模特爾從粗魯的作品内活現了他們童真的藝術天才我的印象是這墨西哥兒童彫刻院是由墨西哥政府出資辦理的凡有爇術興趣丨尤其是彫刻興趣的丨兒童都可以人内修習不收費用並由該院供給材料并教習的指導院内空氣的濃厚兒童的活潑使我感到充分的興趣與羡慕因此使我聯想起美國各地的彫刻很多是出於墨西哥人的手筆是有此來歷的他們從小便開始了兒童的藝術素養了（註最近在美國舊金山建築的交易所大屋底彫刻是請某墨西哥人辦理的曾引起當地工人及藝術家聯盟底重大反感引起嚴重風潮）</p>
<p>回想起在今日的我國藝術教育底荒蕪欲使政府出資辦理如墨西哥似的兒童藝術院正不知待於何日官僚主義與封建勢力底重重只要能有一隅的安頓微薄的同情已足使從事於藝術的人有所慰藉了中國的藝術活動遂不得不集中於較稱偏安的上海以努力於藝術空氣底逐漸濃厚社會的了解逐漸加增　　前幾天陳抱一兄曾經同我談起將預備努力於兒童繪畫運動說是此項運動將由（上海藝專）主動王道源兄的（新的努力）又將這運動公表出來兒童藝術教育之被受到注意可以說是具體化了</p>
<p>兒童藝術教育底運動是在培養兒童藝術天才同時也可被認爲藝術之社會化民衆化底一種工作在今日的中國正需要着的中國政府在目前縱不能出資辦理兒童藝術院但由（上海藝專）所主藝的兒童藝術運動或者也能獲得同樣的結果在今日的中國有多少事是望不到政府辦理須由國民直接舉辦的呢這種兒童藝術教育運動也就是一例</p>
<p>（上海藝專）底歷史雖不甚悠久但其從事於藝術教育底至誠可謂無出其右的了一年來的努力得到社會上不的少同情今回舉辦的兒童藝術教育運動本着誠毅的努力必能有理想的成效</p>
<p>就王道源兄的（新的努力）與陳抱一兄的談話知道這運動多少集中於兒童的繪畫方面及小學校的圖畫課程上但若就兒童藝術教育而言我以爲有下列數點應加注意</p>
<p>（一）兒童藝術教育該是多方面的這是說兒童藝術的運動不能單以繪畫爲對象能有具彫刻裝飾美術天才底兒童而對繪畫少有意興的應企發其獨特的彫刻的或裝飾美術的才能應以兒童的個性而施相同的教養</p>
<p>（二）兒童藝術教育不能全以小學課程爲範疇小學的藝術教程是有限的如有獨異的天才及興趣的兒童應充分發展其藝術的才能故於小學的教程以外應設兒童藝術院以充分培養其藝術的天才上項兒童藝術院即可附設於（上海藝專）</p>
<p>但在藝兒教育荒蕪的中國關於上述的方案一時容或不能實現能有如王道源兄所主唱的兒童繪畫運動至少已足開了兒童藝術教育的運動我們唯有希望其繁榮與將來的發展而已一</p>

<h3>Jin Army Plans Reorganization</h3>
<p>Tui Ji Yiqiao to Report to Shenyang</p>
<p>Zhang Xueliang Hopes Jin Generals Will Maintain Original Agreement</p>
<p>Taiyuan Shang, Xu, and Yang held a second formal meeting with the army commanders and commanders at the General Headquarters at 1:00 PM on the 30th. As a result of the consultation, it was determined that the eight divisions and thirty-two regiments to be retained in Tianjin were too few, and the ten divisions and sixty regiments proposed by the army commanders differed too much from the Tianjin agreement. It was decided to refer to retaining fifty-one regimental commanders and the names of commanders, etc. The army commanders still insisted on cancellation, but this is a transitional nature and does not affect the main points. Before the meeting, Fu Cunhuai, Chen Zengzhi, Zhang Biejie, and Gao Yunjie mediated and proposed the establishment of a committee, which was generally approved after discussion. The number of members is planned to be five to seven, and political personnel may not hold more than half of the seats. Candidates are nominated by the army commanders and have not yet been determined. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Taiyuan Yang Shiyuan, Kong Fan, and Chen Zengzhi hosted a banquet for Ji, Hu, Chen, and the army commanders at the Shanxi Hotel on the 30th. Shang and Xu also attended. In the evening, the army commanders and Xu held a banquet at Rong Honglu's residence to continue discussing the aftermath of the downsizing. It is reported that Zhang's reply to the army commanders' clever telegram has arrived via Ji. The main points are to order the maintenance of the original agreement in Tianjin. The full text has not yet been announced. As a result of continuous consultation between Shang, Xu, and the army commanders, it is hoped that the four-army, eight-division system can be followed. However, internal transitional measures such as establishing a military committee are being sought. Shang has expressed to the army commanders that in order to take the overall situation into account, they must follow Zhang's proposal. Yu is definitely not a mediator and hopes everyone will pay attention. There is indeed no major dispute between the army commanders and Shang and Xu. The Jin situation can be specifically resolved recently. Fu is also quite understanding and has been urged to return by telegram. Rong Honglu will lead the discharged officers to the Pingjiang Martial Arts Hall to discuss the downsizing fees. On the evening of the 30th, he went to meet with Ji et al. to discuss funding. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Taiyuan Wang Jingguo talked about the reorganization of the Jin army, which has a great relationship with the country and the local area, and the aftermath is very important, so the method must be cautious. According to the Tianjin agreement, it is difficult to communicate emotionally by dismissing too many officers who have shared life and death difficulties. The eighteen telegrams from the army commanders were directed at the matter, not at the person. After the General Headquarters meeting, the opinions of all parties have been unified. Whether it is the army commander system or the committee, as long as it benefits the people and the country, the army commanders must insist on it and will never act emotionally, he said. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Taiyuan Zhang Xueliang telegraphed Song Zheyuan and Pang Bingxun to urge the speedy reorganization of Lu Fengnian's troops. (31st Dispatch)</p>

<p>Beiping Regarding the reorganization of the Jin army, the army and division commanders requested the abolition of the army commander and the establishment of a military committee to manage military affairs. Shang Zhen said that the issue is not whether the army commander should be abolished, but whether the reorganization can be realized. Ji Yiqiao was dispatched to Shenyang to report to Zhang Xueliang. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping Zhang Xueliang replied to the clever telegram from the nine division commanders of Jin, saying that the Tianjin agreement was the result of joint consultation between the East, the Central Government, and the Jin army leaders, and that it was definitely not a personal decision. All generals who love the country and their hometown should have sympathy and still hope to maintain the original agreement to facilitate the start of the reorganization. The telegram was forwarded by Ji Yiqiao to Sun Chu and others, informing them that the four-army, eight-division system cannot be increased further because each division is planned to have six regiments, which requires instructions from Chiang and Zhang. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping Jing Yaoyue, the representative of the nine division commanders of Jin, including Sun Chu, met with Zhang Xueliang and later said in Beiping that Zhang's intention was to implement the Tianjin decision. One side is to plan for the aftermath of Jin, and the other side is to plan for the peace of the country. If the eight divisions of the Jin punitive expedition are still insufficient, how can the people of Jin bear it if the number of troops is increased again? At present, the only way is to maintain the decision. The central government fully understands the difficulties of the generals. The request to abolish the army commander and separate the military and the people will be discussed later. Please Jing return to Jin to inform Sun and others to take note of the preliminary downsizing. Jing talked about the departure to Bing. (31st Dispatch)</p>

<h3>America's Democratic Party's Ultimatum</h3>
<p>The reason why there are few violent conflicts between American political parties and the government is that the Republican and Democratic parties have no fundamental disagreements on their core principles, and their policies are largely the same. Moreover, both parties have connections with important figures among politicians and capitalists, and the president can mediate and maintain balance between them. Although the two parties occasionally have disagreements on opinions, they can always be resolved invisibly, so their strength is not impaired. The reason why the policies of the two parties differ slightly is that Republicans have always relied on the industrial areas of the Northeast as their base, while Democrats have relied more on the agricultural areas of the South. Therefore, the Republican Party's policy focuses on industry and commerce to develop financial resources, while the Democratic Party's policy focuses on the people to develop agricultural interests first. Therefore, the two parties inevitably have disagreements in Congress from time to time. However, with industry and commerce booming, although farmers have been slightly suppressed, they have not felt much suffering due to sufficient economic strength. Now that industry and commerce have declined, the domestic economic situation has suddenly changed. Farmers have felt increasingly difficult lives due to the impact of disasters and unemployment. President Hoover has also failed to fulfill his promise to provide relief to agriculture, so feelings have become increasingly worse. Looking at today's telegrams, the Democratic Party has submitted a jointly signed ultimatum to Hoover regarding disaster relief for farmers. The wording is extremely stern, no less than a declaration of war against the Republican Party. I am afraid that this issue cannot be easily resolved like previous issues, and the American Congress will also change into a contentious Congress.</p>

<h3>Gandhi Strives for Indian Freedom</h3>
<p>Dissatisfied with British Prime Minister's Remarks</p>
<p>All India Congress Postpones Meeting</p>
<p>Churchill's Pro-India Propaganda</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 30th - A telegram from Gandhi states that the British Prime Minister's remarks at the closing of the conference are still completely insufficient on the surface. However, I and the majority of members of the National Congress are unanimously and absolutely without prejudice. I have temporarily refrained from making a judgment based on the urgent request of Sapurru and others. Personally, I am now eagerly seeking a way out to achieve the freedom that India desires and deserves through honorable peace. In order to create an atmosphere suitable for calm discussion, the complete release of members of the National Congress who are imprisoned, the repeal of oppressive regulations, and the return of confiscated property are absolutely necessary events.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Bombay, 30th - The All India Congress Executive Committee has postponed the meeting until Sunday due to Nehru's illness.

<h3>Lancashire Cotton Industry Faces Serious Labor Unrest</h3>

<h3>Mussolini Accepts U.S. Apology</h3>
<p>Democratic Party Leader Strongly Defends Butler</p>
<p>Accuses the Italian Prime Minister of Being Nothing More Than a Mad Emperor</p>
<p>Military Tribunal in Preparation</p>
<p>Associated Press, Washington, 30th - Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has accepted the U.S. government's comprehensive apology regarding General Butler's remarks. Democratic Party leader Heflin strongly criticized Mussolini at today's Senate meeting, stating that Butler's ability to speak the truth shows his courage, while Mussolini is nothing more than a mad emperor and a cruel despot. Butler must face a military tribunal because he is a military officer and his words were not cautious. However, Heflin is not an active military officer and is a member of Congress with freedom of speech, so his words, no matter how激烈, cannot be held against him.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Phoenix, Arizona, 30th - A report from Telegrapher Vandermeer, who previously mentioned anecdotes about Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, which General Butler used as material for his speeches and attacked greatly, causing him to be condemned by the government and sent to a military tribunal. The general public has repeatedly intimidated Vandermeer because the disaster was caused by Vandermeer. Vandermeer has now been granted permission by the authorities to carry a handgun to prevent accidents. General Butler's trial is imminent, and the military intends to subpoena Vandermeer to testify at that time. However, Vandermeer's lawyer claims that General Butler's offense to the Italian Prime Minister was due to insults. Whether the facts are true or not is irrelevant to Vandermeer, and Vandermeer's testimony in court will not help. Reuters, Washington, 30th - The Navy Department is now proceeding with preparations for the military trial of General Butler. The number of judges will be no less than five and no more than thirteen, all senior naval officers. The general has hired his old friend, Major Leonard, a famous lawyer, to defend him. Leonard saved General Butler's life in Tianjin during the Chinese Boxer Rebellion.</p>
<h3>U.S. Drought Relief Bill</h3>
<p>Becomes a Point of Contention Between the Two Major Parties</p>
<p>Associated Press, Washington, 30th - Democratic Party members in Congress today jointly submitted an ultimatum to President Hoover, stating that if President Hoover does not accept the plan to allocate 650,000,000 U.S. dollars for disaster relief for farmers and the unemployed, the national legislature may be completely paralyzed and a special session of Congress may have to be convened next summer. Senator Robinson stated at a Senate meeting that there are a total of six types of amendments to the relief plan attached to the national government's expenditure bill. If the authorities force the House of Representatives to erase this amendment, then no matter what bill is proposed in the future, it will not be passed, and a special session of Congress will have to be convened. As for the previous allocation of 25,000,000 U.S. dollars to the Red Cross for disaster relief, it was not approved by the House of Representatives. Therefore, this time, the Democratic Party is determined to use harsh measures to fight against the Republican Party and the government. Moreover, the Democratic Party's proposal for a special session of the 72nd Congress next time may gain a majority with the support of progressives and radical elements of the Republican Party. However, today's ultimatum is the most激烈的 dispute between the government and the Senate since last December.</p>
<h3>Japanese Seiyūkai: Overthrow the Cabinet Rally</h3>
<p>More than 2,000 People Attend</p>
<p>Police Authorities Implement Strict Security</p>
<p>Prime Minister Pro Tempore Kijūrō Shidehara Unfamiliar with Reply</p>
<p>Naval Replenishment Plan Faces Further Issues</p>
<p>Tokyo, January 31st, Japan United Press – The Seiyūkai held a major rally today at noon to overthrow the Hamaguchi Cabinet. At the entrance to the venue, slogans such as "Overthrow the Deceptive Cabinet" and "A List of Finance Minister Inoue's Dishonesty" were posted. Over 2,000 people attended, including members of both the House of Peers and the House of Representatives belonging to the party, led by Inukai Tsuyoshi, and general public. Secretary-General Mori delivered the opening address, Matsuoka criticized Shidehara's diplomacy, Ōta mentioned the economic recession, Hamada Kunimatsu denounced the Wushe Incident, Yamazaki brought up the issue of the acting prime minister, Andō touched on the unemployment problem, and Sanshi addressed financial and economic issues. The police authorities dispatched 700 police officers to the venue for security.</p>
<p>Tokyo, January 31st, Electric Communication Society – The House of Representatives’ General Budget Committee meeting commenced today at 10:00 AM. Sunada continued his attack from yesterday on financial and economic problems, the recession, and price issues, taking the lead in criticizing ministers such as Shidehara, Inoue, Yasube, and Machida. Next, Uchida addressed the replenishment plan issue, Ōta discussed economic problems, Matsuoka and Kiyose covered diplomatic issues, and Hamada Kunimatsu debated the Wushe Incident, each displaying their eloquence in a relentless attack on the government. The government side also remained highly vigilant. Overall, both the government, the ruling party, and the opposition parties approached today's General Budget Committee meeting with unusual tension.</p>
<p>Tokyo, January 31st, Electric Communication Society – The House of Peers formally convened at 10:25 AM today. Katsuta of the Research Group continued his questioning from the previous day, stating that although Finance Minister Inoue claimed yesterday that the fiscal year Showa 5 deficit was approximately 80 million yen, he estimated that it would reach at least 120 million yen by the end of the fiscal year. Furthermore, the budget deficit for Showa 6 would reach over 200 million yen. He questioned whether the government had full confidence in the budget. Finance Minister Inoue replied that since the abolition of the tobacco monopoly, revenue had increased by 10 million yen, and based on the state of revenue, there was certainly no cause for concern. The budget for Showa 6 was 155 million yen lower than the current fiscal year's budget, so there was no possibility of a huge deficit as Katsuta claimed. Fujita reiterated that the government had repeatedly altered the approved budget, showing disregard for the parliament's right to consent. To maintain the facade of non-borrowing, it no longer included German reparations in the debt reduction fund and used unemployment relief as an excuse to issue many public bonds. It was patching here and there while still wanting to reduce taxes, which was very contradictory. He further questioned Army Minister Uegaki, stating that although military reform had been a long-standing issue, there was still no progress. He asked what the reason was. Army Minister Uegaki replied that military reform required extensive investigation and could not be achieved overnight. Furthermore, budget cuts had greatly reduced regular expenses, making it even more difficult. However, the Military Reform Review Committee was continuing to study this issue. The League of Nations might also promote a disarmament conference, and this point was also being considered and carefully addressed. Katsuta further criticized the government's shift from its non-borrowing policy in less than a year, indicating a flaw in the current government's policies. He also discussed local finance and asked the Finance Minister what relief measures were available. The questioning concluded here, and the meeting adjourned at 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>Tokyo, January 31st, Electric Communication Society – Seiyūkai councilors convened yesterday and strongly condemned Prime Minister Kijūrō Shidehara's response to the House of Peers’ questioning, asserting that evading the important responsibility of assistance was an outrageous act unacceptable to those in responsible political positions and resolving to continue to denounce it.</p>
<p>Tokyo, January 31st, Electric Communication Society – At yesterday's House of Representatives General Budget Committee meeting, Sunada of the Seiyūkai used sharp arguments and extensive, incisive material regarding the economic recession and price problems to directly attack the government's gold standard lifting and its erroneous aftermath. This put Finance Minister Inoue in a position where he could not provide a theoretical defense, achieving a distinguished victory in this parliamentary questioning battle. The government seemed to feel a significant threat from Sunada's attack.</p>
<p>Tokyo, January 31st, Electric Communication Society – At yesterday's House of Representatives General Budget Committee meeting, Navy Minister Yasube offered a significant clarification in response to Uchida's questioning. When Uchida questioned that if the entire expenditure of 240 million yen for the construction of warships in the First Replenishment Plan would be completed by the end of Showa 11, and the launching of warships would be completed by the latest in Showa 10, how would the naval authorities maintain Japan's shipbuilding capacity after Showa 11, given the expected sharp reduction in factory work? Navy Minister Yasube replied that a Second Replenishment Plan would be established before Showa 11 to maintain shipbuilding capacity. This response clearly indicated that if the Second Replenishment Plan were included in the budget before Showa 11, its financial resources would become a problem. There was a concern that the financial resources the government had reserved for tax cuts would be taken away by the navy, deepening the doubts. It was reported that the Second Replenishment Plan would total 140 million yen and include (1) one aircraft carrier, (2) six destroyers, (3) several fast work ships, fast oil tankers, minelayers, and other restricted vessels, and (4) the establishment of two additional air squadrons, with construction and expansion as its main focus.</p>

<h3>Executive Yuan Refutes Anhui Province's Request to Increase Salt Surtax</h3>
<p>Recently, the Anhui Provincial Government submitted another memorial to the Executive Yuan, detailing the situation of adding a surtax to Zhejiang salt in southern Anhui and Huai-Lu salt in northern Anhui, requesting special consideration. It is heard that after receiving this memorial, the Executive Yuan has instructed to reject it, stating that before the imposition of the salt tax surtax, the National Government clearly ordered that it be allocated to the Ministry of Finance for unified collection and management, and that provinces should not independently establish items for collection. It was ordered by the Yuan to comply, and the province's imposition of a surtax on Zhejiang salt in southern Anhui and Huai-Lu salt in northern Anhui after the order was issued clearly violated the decree and harmed both national tax revenue and the people's food supply. It is expected that the previous orders will be strictly followed, the collection will be revoked immediately, and a report will be submitted, and the Ministry of Finance will be notified.</p>
<h3>Surtax on Salt and Rice in Northern Anhui Still Being Collected</h3>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: Although the surtax on salt managed by the Anhui Provincial Government has been stopped by the Central Government and opposed by local authorities, the province, concerned with its revenue, continues to actively pursue it regardless. The Bengbu General Bureau for the Collection of Salt Surtax in Northern Anhui was previously ordered by the Department of Finance to start collecting the tax from the 10th of this month. At that time, due to the strong opposition from the Huai Salt Merchants Association and other groups, and the fact that the salt transported by various merchants was piled up on ships and they refused to transport it ashore and declare the tax, resulting in a passive resistance, there was actually no tax to collect. Now, the Department of Finance has sent Chief Section Zuo to Bengbu to urge the start of collection. The Northern Anhui Collection Bureau has re-established a branch bureau in Suzhou to collect surtax on Eastern Salt. In Quanjiao and Lai'an counties, salt merchants are responsible for collecting surtax on tickets for salt. Due to the small amount of salt coming from Xiba in the lower reaches of the Huai River, no branch bureaus are temporarily set up in Siyang and Wuhe. Regarding the rice tax issue, after the Establishment of the General Inspection Office for Sailboat Rice Tax in Dashengguan, branch inspection offices for sailboat rice tax were established in Rendingpu, Huayang, Tianchang, Wuhe, Chuzhou, Huaiyuan, and Chenjiaqian. Representatives from the chambers of commerce in Bengbu, Linhuai, Mingguang, Huaiyuan, and Chuzhou in Northern Anhui went to Beijing to petition the Executive Yuan for revocation. It is heard that the Executive Yuan telegraphed the Anhui Department of Finance to immediately cancel the collection. Those that have not yet been established must not be established. However, the general and branch inspection offices for sailboat rice tax that have already been established are still actively proceeding because they have not received the Department of Finance's order to revoke. Since the Huaiyuan Branch Inspection Office for Sailboat Rice Tax in Northern Anhui began collecting rice tax fees on the 21st of this month, it has collected over 1,000 yuan to date. This rice tax charges six jiao per stone of rice and three jiao per stone of paddy and miscellaneous grains. The branch office has inspection posts in Bengbu, Guzhen, Suzhou, Linhuaiguan, and Fuliji, each staffed with a director. The Bengbu inspection post has been established in the Huadong Apartment. At first, the grain merchants were quite hesitant. After the chamber of commerce came forward to mediate, for grain and rice transported out by train, a registration method was used, requiring reporting of the tax fee but temporarily not paying it, recording it in a book as a disaster relief fund, and observing whether the Wuhu rice merchants paid the fee as a contingency, quietly awaiting a solution from Wuhu. Although they did not ostensibly pay the tax fee, they had actually tacitly agreed. (January 29th)</p>
<h3>Anhui Province's Regulations for the Collection of Business Tax</h3>
<p>After abolishing the Likin tax, Anhui Province is actively preparing for the business tax to compensate for the loss. The Provincial Government has submitted the Business Tax Collection Regulations to the 166th Provincial Government Standing Committee for amendment and approval, ordering the Department of Finance to comply. The regulations are recorded as follows: (Article 1) The collection of business tax and business license registration fees in this province shall be handled in accordance with these regulations, except as otherwise provided by the laws and regulations of the Central Government. (Article 2) All shops and merchants in cities and towns of this province shall apply for a business license every year and pay business tax and business license registration fee. However, companies that have already paid income tax to the Central Government and special taxes collected by the Central Government that are not within the scope of local business tax are not subject to this restriction. (Article 3) All merchants applying for a business license shall submit the following items to the local business tax collection agency: (1) Business type, name, and location; (2) Name, origin, and address of the business operator; (3) Business capital; (4) Estimated annual business income. (Article 4) For all types of businesses with an annual business income of more than 1,000 yuan, business tax shall be levied at a rate of two per mille. For the above ratio, those with a full 1,000 yuan shall be levied a business tax of 2 yuan, those with more than 1,000 yuan up to 1,500 yuan shall be levied a business tax of 3 yuan, those with more than 1,500 yuan up to 2,000 yuan shall be levied a business tax of 4 yuan, and the remainder shall be increased by 500 yuan as a unit. (Article 5) When it is not possible to levy tax based on business income, it shall be levied at 20 per mille of the capital or by other calculation methods.

<h3>Kong and Li's Bandits Occupy Gao'an Again</h3>
<p>Gao'an is Only a Hundred Miles from Nanchang</p>
<p>Lu Has Telegraphed Liu and Hao's Units to Suppress Them</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Communist bandits Kong Hechong and Li Shixing, after fleeing from Wanzai and occupying Shanggao and Yifeng, advanced towards Gao'an again. It is heard that this group numbers about three to four thousand people. On the 25th, they captured the county seat of Gao'an and looted extensively. All the shops and residents' money and valuables were looted, and fires were set everywhere. From Taifuhou at the north gate of the county seat to the Construction Bureau, an entire street was reduced to scorched earth. Some other places were also burned down, destroying many shops. The entire essence of the county was reduced to ashes. Zhang Hongzao, the chief of the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau, is a native of Gao'an. After receiving the above report on the evening of the 25th, he immediately went to the Ninth Route Army Department with fellow villagers to request the dispatch of troops for support. At the same time, he telegraphed Lu Zongzhihui in Ji'an for instructions. After receiving the telegram, Lu Dipin immediately telegraphed Liu Yi's Independent 14th Brigade and Hao Mengling's 54th Division stationed in northern Jiangxi to suppress them. However, Gao'an is only a hundred miles from the province. The provincial capital was quite alarmed after receiving the above news, but with heavy troops stationed in the provincial capital, there is certainly no cause for concern. Furthermore, the Public Security Bureau has received news that one brigade of Hao Mengling's unit is advancing from Fengxin towards Gao'an and Shanggao to cut off the bandits' retreat, and Mao Tuan's unit of the 14th Brigade is also advancing from Shengmi Wanshou Palace towards Gao'an County. The Public Security Bureau received a telephone call from Wanshou Palace at noon, stating that Liu's brigade and Mao's unit had entered Wanshou Palace, only a few dozen miles from Gao'an. The communist bandits' sentries had been deployed to five miles southeast of the county seat, and they have now withdrawn most of them, appearing to be retreating towards Yifeng. The county seat will be recovered tomorrow. (27th)</p>
<h3>Aftermath of the Yang Family's Library in Liaocheng</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Yang Family's Haiyuan Pavilion Library in Liaocheng has suffered severe losses, and the remnants are now being transported to Jinan for preservation. The Provincial Government, considering the books' relation to Chinese culture, has instructed the Department of Education to discuss preservation measures with the Yang family, with approximately three options: (1) Have the Yang family preserve the books themselves, establish the Haiyuan Pavilion Library in Jinan, with a descendant of the Yang family as the librarian. The library's ticket sales revenue would go to the Yang family, and the government would pay the librarian a monthly salary. (2) Purchase half and donate half, placing the books under provincial ownership. (3) The government would fully fund the purchase. It is yet to be determined which option will be adopted.</p>
<h3>Opening of the Northeast Financial Conference</h3>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: Zhang Xueliang believes that the financial situations of the northern provinces and cities urgently need to be reorganized. With the abolition of Likin, the income is increasingly insufficient and needs to be addressed. After returning to Shenyang from Tianjin, he instructed the Finance Department of the Northeast Political Affairs Committee to prepare for the convocation of a financial conference. He also telegraphed the financial authorities of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Rehe, Hebei, Shanxi, Chahar, Beiping-Tianjin, and Harbin provinces and cities to come to Shenyang to participate. The preparations have now been completed, and the opening ceremony was held at the Provincial Government on the 26th.

Chairman Zhang Xueliang delivered the opening speech, stating that with the completion of the military pacification and the achievement of unification, the Central Government is implementing innovative policies to alleviate the suffering of the people and uphold the abolition of Likin in order to develop the national economy. He strongly supports the abolishment of the Likin system and the implementation of new taxes to compensate for the loss. He had previously telegraphed the provinces to comply with the order to abolish Likin and prepare for new taxes. During this transitional period of abolishing Likin and establishing new taxes, the finances of each province urgently need to be actively reorganized, aiming to address both the needs of the national economy and finance, while also considering legal governance. The finances of all provinces should be centralized in the Central Government to achieve financial unification. He would fully comply with the Central Government's intentions to reorganize the finances of each province and hoped that all members would sincerely discuss the financial policies of each province, region, and city. After the speech, the ceremony concluded and adjourned. From the 27th onwards, discussion sessions will be held from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM, and review sessions will be held from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM. The conference is scheduled to last for ten days.

<p>Human Traffickers Arrested and Handed Over to the Bureau: Hu Axi, a resident of Yangxiang in the fourth district (Kaiyuan Township) of the county, has been working as a butcher in Shanghai. In 1928, through matchmaker Zhou Quan, he married Ms. Sui, the younger sister of Sui Xiangyu from Changzhou. After the marriage, the relationship between the couple was considered harmonious. Recently, Hu's wife, Ms. Sui, was trafficked by women Zhang Jinxiu and Zhang Shen, etc., for 140 yuan. When Sui Xiangyu, Ms. Sui's elder brother, learned about this, he took a train from Changzhou and brought the traffickers Zhang Jinxiu, Zhang Shen, and Ms. Sui's husband, Hu Axi, and Hu's mother, Zhang, to the ninth public security sub-bureau and asked for an investigation. After preliminary interrogation by Sub-bureau Chief Liu, he prepared a document yesterday and handed them over to the County Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<p>A Commissioner's Romantic History: Recently, a commissioner dispatched by the province came to Wuxi to inspect police affairs, staying at the New World Hotel. Unexpectedly, the commissioner had a certain disease and called for a prostitute, Sun Lirong, to accompany him for the night. In addition, two other people, a township sub-bureau chief and a police officer, also called for prostitutes to enjoy themselves. The scene was filled with extravagance and debauchery. The day before yesterday, the commissioner left Wuxi for Suzhou, taking a young woman with him. The woman was Zhou Xingzhen, the concubine of Shen Xiang from Niushenong in the city. Shen Xiang found out about this and was furious. He tracked them to the Dongwu Hotel in Suzhou and arrested both the commissioner and Zhou Xingzhen, handing them over to the first sub-bureau in the area for temporary detention and investigation. Shen then returned to Wuxi and reported the incident to the Public Security Bureau, requesting that they be brought back to Wuxi for trial. After receiving the report, Director Xu ordered the second sub-bureau to arrest the prostitute Lirong and interrogate her. She confessed to sleeping with the commissioner for three nights and with several other inspectors for several nights.

As a result, the atmosphere of demolition was once again very active. It is now heard that after the announcement of the resolution, sixteen people, including Mr. A of the county, stated that with the rampant activities of bandits in recent days, if the city wall is demolished, the lives and properties of the city residents would be completely unprotected. Furthermore, Nanchang is currently building earth forts to defend against bandits, which shows that the city wall is necessary to be preserved temporarily. They listed the reasons and jointly telegraphed Chairman Jiang of the National Government, requesting that the demolition be waived. After receiving the telegram, Chairman Jiang reportedly approved the request and ordered that the demolition be waived. This order will arrive in Wuxi within a few days.</p>

A few days ago, Hu Qingfu suddenly returned secretly and was arrested and brought to the county. Just as the court was about to open, someone offered to mediate, and Wanhe Grain Store initially offered 3,500 yuan, with the remaining 10,000 yuan to be paid in installments over two years.

Director Li Zhibin immediately went to search at 10:00 PM, together with police captain Tu. The two bandits guarding the captives in the back of the house were captured, and weapons were seized. Five captives, both adults and children, were rescued in the thatched hut in the back field. They were taken back for interrogation overnight.

<h3>Hefei</h3>
<p>Shucheng County Prisoners Escape: A guest from Shucheng County mentioned that at around 9:00 PM on the 22nd, a prison warden in the county discovered that a prisoner surnamed Xu, a former platoon leader in a certain army who had been sentenced to life imprisonment for adultery, rushed out of the prison with a kitchen knife. The other prisoners followed suit, seizing five rifles from the public security police guarding the prison gate and fleeing out of the North Gate along Tangcang Alley and Hou Street. Merchants and residents, unaware of the details, hurriedly closed their doors, creating great chaos. The prison warden ran to the county government to report, and County Magistrate Wu Yunfeng immediately led the group police to pursue them. However, because the round trip from the Xiaodongmen county government to the Drum Tower Prison was too far, the bandits had already regrouped and fled far away. They then tightly closed the city gate and searched, capturing only three prisoners with shackles and fetters in the Ni family garden and the open space of Dadongmen, and took them back to prison. A headcount of the prisoners revealed that 21 prisoners had escaped from the prison and 4 prisoners had escaped from the detention center. Neighboring counties have been notified to set up roadblocks.</p>
<p>Letters Received</p>
<h3>Letter from the Township Head of Huinong Township, First District, Nanhui County:</h3>
<p>Respectfully, upon reading the local news in your newspaper on January 25th, the section mentioning "Accused of being a thief, attempted suicide, and was rescued" does not correspond to the facts.

Following the sound, they discovered that the household of Zhang Yixian had a damaged fence. They apprehended one Zhao Asan, who, when questioned, stated that Chen Yena and Mao Laoer were his accomplices. The three people Chen, Mao, and Zhao were captured and were to be brought to the local county jail. However, after their family members pleaded and the victim signed the necessary release documents, they were released, without any form of coercion. This special letter is to request that the letter be added to the "Letters Received" section and corrected accordingly. With respect, Gu Kaitong, Township Head of Huinong Township, First District, Nanhui County, bows on January 27th.</p>

The gatekeeper stated that the Minister was unable to receive guests due to illness, and that if the representatives had any petitions, they could leave them for the authorities to submit. The representatives handed over the petition they had brought and planned to visit again after Minister Song recovered, to achieve their goal.</p>
<p>Business Tax Assessment Standards: Over 160 industry associations in this city sent a telegram yesterday as follows: To the National Government of Nanjing, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, the Provincial Governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and the Shanghai Municipal Government: It is heard that Zhejiang province lost 4.5 million yuan annually after the abolition of likin taxes, so the business tax rate could not be reduced. Although the authorities are concerned about the people's livelihood and sympathized with merchants, they were also suffering from a shortage of funds and had to take it from the people. During the recent petitions, it was stated that the increase in customs duties to compensate for the abolition of likin taxes was the unanimous expectation of merchants across the country. Now that the abolition of likin taxes has been implemented, the national revenue is reduced by 90 million yuan, while the new customs revenue this year has increased by 70 million yuan, and with the revenue from consolidated taxes and special taxes, the total should not be less than 90 million yuan. The two offset each other with a surplus. According to recent reports, the central government has subsidized the administrative expenses of various provinces. Hubei receives 200,000 yuan per month, Hunan receives 200,000 yuan per month, Jiangxi receives 110,000 yuan per month, and Fujian receives 100,000 yuan per month. The central government's overall calculation is equal and unified, and it should not uniquely allow Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to suffer from the lack of resources. Moreover, the donation taxes in Jiangsu and Zhejiang have always been heavier than in other provinces, and Zhejiang's taxes are even heavier than Jiangsu's. The increase in customs duties is passed on to the people, and the people in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces bear more of the burden because of their greater purchasing power. Now, if the provincial government insists on taking the full loss of 4.5 million yuan from the business tax, it would be biased in terms of reason and difficult to sustain in terms of ability. Furthermore, Mr. Ma Yinchu, a member of the Legislative Yuan, said in a speech at the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters the other day that Zhejiang province gained an additional 25% in the likin era, so it could get 1.4 million yuan per year. Now that the likin tax has been abolished, this 1.4 million yuan in revenue has naturally been canceled. Therefore, in order to compensate for the revenue of various provinces after the abolition of likin taxes, the central government had to implement the business tax. Judging from this, the revenue standard for Zhejiang province's business tax should be limited to the annual 1.4 million yuan from the 25% surtax on likin. According to the current business tax rate proposed by Zhejiang province, the annual revenue can reach 2.5 to 3 million yuan, which exceeds the loss from the abolition of likin taxes by a factor of two. If merchants hope to reduce the burden through the abolition of likin taxes, and the provincial government increases revenue due to the abolition of likin taxes, it would not be the government's benevolence to merchants, nor would it be implementing the original intention of the likin tax policy. We sincerely request your government to give special consideration, and the business tax rate should be based on the loss of surtax revenue for the provincial government after the abolition of likin taxes. The number of insufficient government expenses should be requested from the central government in order to achieve fairness. Zhejiang and Shanghai are geographically close, with close commercial ties. We dare to present our views and appeal on your behalf. We respectfully request your approval. (Signatures omitted)</p>
<p>Presentations to the Municipal Authorities: The Tax Rules Research Committee of the Shanghai Business Industry Association yesterday separately sent letters to the municipal authorities of this city and the construction and finance discussion committees: Respectfully submitted, we previously read in the newspaper the instructions of the municipal government that the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce requested to be allowed to send representatives to participate in the discussion when formulating business tax rates, etc., and ordered the Municipal Finance Bureau to investigate. On January 30th, we also read in the newspaper that Secretary-General Yu informed that Mayor Zhang has decided on three reasons for the business tax in this city: (1) Unwilling to burden Chinese merchants more than the concessions, (2) The tax rate must not be higher than Jiangsu and Zhejiang, or must be lower, (3) Accommodating the opinions of merchants, the municipal government will not arbitrarily set tax rates. This shows that the municipal government has insight into the people's sentiments and concern for the commercial situation, and we are grateful for its virtue. This association respects the wise authorities' aim to broadly gather opinions, and presents its views on the issue of implementing business tax in this city. The proposals are as follows: (1) Using consolidated taxes and special taxes to compensate for the central government's loss from the abolition of likin taxes, and using business taxes to compensate for the local loss from the abolition of likin taxes, was originally the main point agreed upon at the likin tax conference. The level of business tax rates in various provinces and cities should be considered within the framework of the guidelines promulgated by the Executive Yuan, and the tax rate should be determined based on the actual loss of likin tax in this province and city. The amount of loss of likin tax in this city should be announced by the municipal finance authorities in advance so that the citizens can be aware of it, and at the same time, it can be seen as supporting the progress of municipal administration. We also do not want the municipal authorities to lose revenue due to the abolition of likin tax and suffer from the lack of resources. (2) This city has the distinction between the Chinese area and the concessions, and revitalizing the Chinese area market is a consistent policy of the municipal authorities. The mayor does not want the burden of the Chinese merchants to be heavier than that of the concessions, which will affect the plan to revitalize the Chinese area. Therefore, when determining the business tax rate based on the amount of likin tax loss in this city in the future, merchants in both the Chinese and concession areas should bear the same burden, and not allow the Chinese area to be weakened. (3) Increasing the burden on citizens must be approved by the representatives of the citizens. This has been regarded as the golden rule in democratic countries. According to the municipal system promulgated by the government, the representative body of citizens in a city is the Municipal Assembly. This city previously had the establishment of the Municipal Council. The councilors of the Municipal Council were all appointed by the mayor. In the one year of its existence, it was able to consider the citizens' concerns regarding the additional housing tax levied by the former Municipal Finance Bureau and resolved to reduce the collection. Although the reduction method has been cancelled, the citizens still have not forgotten the good governance of the former Municipal Council. After the cancellation of the Municipal Council, there are now the Construction Discussion Committee and the Finance Discussion Committee in the municipal government, which are still appointed by the municipal authorities. However, in name and in fact, the purpose of discussion is to consult with the authorities and for the members to contribute their opinions. In terms of their nature, the members include both administrative officials and leaders from various sectors, which is different from the former Municipal Council and even more different from the Municipal Assembly in the municipal system. In terms of their power, they naturally do not have the possibility of representing the citizens to increase the burden. In fact, even if all the members are famous figures and business leaders in Shanghai, the procedure for appointment and election is different in law, and the qualifications of natural persons and legal representatives are also different. The municipal authorities should be aware of this. However, in Secretary-General Yu's talk, it was mentioned that "many of the members of the Finance Committee are merchants and can represent the merchants." Therefore, we do not avoid the trouble of clarifying its nature. If the wise authorities can accommodate the opinions of the merchants, they should directly convene representatives from various industries to have an open discussion before a decision can be made. The above three points are the most important. We believe that the wise authorities of our municipal government and the members of the Construction and Finance Committees will be able to accept them. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Government, Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau, Shanghai Municipal Finance Discussion Committee, Shanghai Municipal Construction Discussion Committee.</p>
<h3>Kong Xiangxi's Talk</h3>
<p>The League of Nations Gold Loan is Not Confirmed</p>
<p>American Loan is Private Negotiation</p>
<p>Minister of Industry Kong Xiangxi arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning at seven o'clock on the overnight express train from Beijing. This newspaper's reporter interviewed him at his residence yesterday. The record of his talk is as follows:</p>
<p>Niyue Bank: The reporter first asked about the methods used by the Ministry of Industry to deal with the aftermath of the Niyue Bank and the liquidation of the Great World Amusement Savings Department. He replied that the Ministry of Industry had instructed the Social Affairs Bureau to carefully supervise the liquidation. The first step should be to investigate the contents of the company's organization and the names of the directors and shareholders. Since the company has not been registered, the directors and others should bear unlimited liability. It is his opinion that this matter is of great importance to the financial welfare of the lower and middle classes of society in Shanghai, and he hopes that the municipal government can work hard to take responsibility for handling the matter, so that depositors will not suffer losses. Gold Industry Exchange: Kong said that the Ministry of Industry has been considering banning gold industry exchanges for a long time. The current gold rush is turbulent, and the changes are huge in a day. Those who have lost their fortunes because of this are countless. Therefore, it has been stipulated that the traders in the exchange are limited to importers and exporters in order to show the restriction. Recently, it is planned to add special commissioners to be stationed in the office to supervise everything, but no agency will be set up.</p>
<p>Gold and Silver Loans: Recently, there has been much noise about the League of Nations lending 10 million gold pounds and the American loan. Kong told reporters yesterday that the American loan was only a matter of private negotiation and was far from the truth. The League of Nations gold loan is even more absurd. The League of Nations itself needs to be maintained by various countries. How can it have huge amounts of gold to lend to others? Furthermore, the League of Nations Health Minister Lachman came to China to investigate health undertakings, and the Soviet Union's Minister of Economic Affairs Su Lide came to China at the request of the Ministry of Finance to investigate the economy for the purpose of promoting reforms and has nothing to do with loans, he said.</p>
<h3>Wang Boqun's Talk</h3>
<p>Telegraph and Postal System to be Reformed Immediately: Preparing a Direct Radio Station to London: The Sino-German Aviation Route is Difficult to Test Fly at the End of the Month: Minister of Communications Wang Boqun came to Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning to recuperate and is scheduled to return to Beijing tonight. This newspaper's reporter specially visited and asked about the reform of the old system and the construction of new undertakings in the field of communications, and he answered in detail. Regarding the Sino-German aviation issue that has been publicized for a long time, it has been reported in the newspapers that it will be possible to test fly at the end of this month. Minister Wang told reporters that the preparations for the Sino-German air route still require time, and it is still difficult to hope to implement the test flight at the end of this month. However, the four aircraft that have already been purchased will arrive in Shanghai around the tenth of this month. Minister Wang then said that our country now has a telegraph management bureau in each province, which is not appropriate in terms of administrative system, talent, and economy. The establishment of a telegraph management bureau with the province as the unit easily flows into the disadvantage of being close to the province and isolated from the ministry. One telegraph management bureau in each province, the administrative line is divided into several sections, and each bureau has one director and one engineer, which uses more people and has less efficiency. Therefore, it has been decided to change the establishment of the telegraph management bureau to take the line as the unit. Even if a line crosses several provinces, it will still be managed by one bureau. In this way, the administration can be unified and the use of personnel can be economical. As for the postal management bureau, the one that uses the province as the unit has also been decided to be changed to use the convenience of transportation as the standard. In areas where transportation is convenient, several provinces will establish one management, such as Jiangsu and Anhui provinces, which have now been merged into one postal area with only one management bureau. In areas where transportation is inconvenient, one province will establish several management bureaus. As for the electrical materials, the cost of purchasing them from foreign countries every year is very high, and gold and silver are even more affected. It is now planned to borrow money to open a factory to manufacture them ourselves, so that the cost of electrical materials can be saved by at least half. Regarding the construction of radio, the Fenglinqiao radio station has been established and can only communicate with cities in Asia. The Zhenru radio station has been connected to New York, Berlin, and Paris. The radio station that is directly connected to London is still missing. The Ministry of Communications also plans to start preparations. The power of the Zhenru and Fenglinqiao radio stations is still weak. Several larger generators purchased from Germany have been shipped to Hong Kong and will be shipped to Shanghai for installation soon. Finally, Minister Wang stated to reporters that the report that the Executive Yuan meeting passed a resolution to investigate Zhuang Zhihuan, Director of the Electrical Affairs Department, and appointed Minister Song and others to investigate is completely fabricated.</p>
<h3>Wang Zhengting Went to Ningbo Yesterday</h3>
<p>Received Shigemitsu Aoi Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Returned Home to Celebrate Father-in-Law's Birthday</p>
<p>Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Zhengting received Huddman, the newly appointed Swedish minister to China and Japan, at the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at eleven o'clock yesterday morning. At 11:40 AM, Japanese Chargé d'Affaires Shigemitsu Aoi went to visit and talked for twenty minutes. At 12:30 PM, he received Dr. Guo Bingwen. He returned to his residence to rest at 1:00 PM. Wang's spirit did not seem to have fully recovered after his illness. He told this newspaper's reporter yesterday that Shigemitsu's visit was an ordinary courtesy call, and he briefly discussed the Ningbo and Hankou cases between China and Japan. As for the issue of recovering the Japanese concession in Hankou, it was not discussed. The ambassadors of England, France, and the Netherlands will go south in a few days to continue the negotiations on extraterritoriality, he said. Wang and his wife, children, and nurses took the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Xinjiangtian steamer to Ningbo at 5:00 PM yesterday afternoon and went directly to Fenghua, his hometown, to celebrate his father-in-law's birthday. He is scheduled to stay for two or three days before returning to Shanghai and then to Beijing to report for duty.</p>
<h3>City Health Bureau: Preventing Meningitis</h3>
<p>Releasing Essential Knowledge on Prevention and Treatment</p>
<p>Dispatching Personnel with Medicine to Hangzhou for Treatment</p>
<p>In light of the widespread epidemic of epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis in Zhejiang Province, which poses a serious threat of infection, the City Health Bureau, in addition to complying with the central government's order to send personnel to Zhejiang Province to assist in suppressing the disease and administering preventive injections, has formulated an expanded prevention plan for the city and submitted it to the municipal government for approval. Once approved, it will be implemented immediately. Yesterday, a public notice was issued to guide prevention and facilitate public awareness, which is transcribed below:</p>
<p>Essential Knowledge on Prevention and Treatment of Epidemic Cerebrospinal Meningitis (Commonly Known as Convulsions)</p>
<p>(A) Essential Knowledge on Preventing Meningitis</p>
<p>(1) Wear a face mask. These masks are sold in pharmacies at a very cheap price. After buying one, use several layers of cooked gauze (also sold in pharmacies at a low price) to cover the mouth and nose. This way, when breathing in air, it will be filtered, preventing airborne germs from invading the body.</p>
<p>(2) Avoid going to crowded places. Crowded places are most prone to spreading diseases because some people, although not sick themselves, carry germs on their bodies. Contact with them can cause infection. Therefore, unless there is a legitimate reason, avoid going to crowded places to reduce the chance of contracting the disease.</p>
<p>(3) Pay attention to personal hygiene.</p>
<p>(1) The food and drink, clothing, housing, bedding, and utensils used should all be clean. Hair should be cut regularly, and baths taken.</p>
<p>(2) Doors and windows should be opened frequently to allow air to circulate, and one should go to open spaces from time to time to breathe fresh air. The air in crowded places is turbid, and germs inevitably float around, so it is best to avoid them.</p>
<p>(3) Sunlight is good for killing germs, so daily clothing, bedding, and even the inside of houses should be exposed to sunlight. Everyone should pay more attention to hygiene, and the body will be strong and have the power to resist germs. Even if exposed to germs, one will not suffer too much harm. Therefore, paying attention to hygiene is the fundamental way to prevent disease.</p>
<p>(4) Isolate: Do not come into contact with patients. If a family member unfortunately contracts the disease, they should be sent to the hospital for treatment immediately to prevent uninfected people from being infected. If it is necessary to personally care for the patient, a face mask must be worn.</p>
<p>(5) Disinfect: All items used by the patient must be boiled in boiling water, washed, or exposed to sunlight for several days. Under no circumstances should they be used immediately. In particular, food eaten by the patient should not be eaten again.</p>
<p>(B) Essential Knowledge on Treating Meningitis</p>
<p>(1) Sending the patient to the hospital for treatment is the most appropriate course of action.</p>
<p>(2) Report to our bureau immediately so that we can send a doctor to provide guidance, which will be beneficial and harmless to the patient and their family. Our bureau's assigned doctors will not cost the patient's family a penny.</p>
<p>The National Government's Ministry of Health, due to the severe epidemic of cerebrospinal meningitis in the vicinity of Hangzhou, which has caused heavy casualties, has ordered Qian and Yao to rush to investigate and urgently telegraphed Director Hu of the City Health Bureau to additionally dispatch Director Cheng of the Testing Institute to quickly prepare various applicable testing materials, such as culture media and serum, to take to Hangzhou for joint investigation and testing of the disease to eradicate it as soon as possible and prevent its spread.</p>
<h3>Preparation for Dredging the Divine Shoal</h3>
<p>Financing: Additional Duty on Imported Goods Starts in April</p>
<p>Schedule: Five-Year Program</p>
<p>Implementation: Custom-Built Dredging Ship</p>
<p>The Divine Shoal in the southern waterway of the Yangtze River estuary has long hindered the development of the Port of Shanghai for ocean-going vessels with deep drafts. Now that the government has decided to dredge it, the Jianghai Customs will levy an additional dredging duty on imported goods, calculated at three percent of the ad valorem tariff rate of five percent. This will be stored separately as dredging funds. According to the Chief Engineer of the Dredging Bureau, speaking to a reporter from the North China Daily News, this additional duty will be levied starting in April based on the actual amount of import tax collected, and will no longer be calculated based on the five percent tariff rate. The Commissioner of Customs has ordered the Customs to do so, so the amount of additional duty collected in the future should be more than double. As for the dredging project, it has long been set as a five-year program. The bureau has ordered a large suction dredging ship from abroad, about 300 feet long, which looks quite like a cargo ship. The dredging method is that when the ship moves, it digs the mud into a trough and then sucks the mud and water into the ship's hold, so it does not need to anchor and stop, which would hinder navigation. Its work capacity can exceed the bureau's existing crab claw-style dredging ships by more than five times. The dredging ships used at Dagu Port are of this type, but the ship body is smaller. The first of the ships ordered this time should arrive in Shanghai by the end of next year, at which time work can begin. However, before the dredging is carried out, a special measurement must be taken to determine the dredging location in detail.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Yarn Exported to India</h3>
<p>Opportunity due to the Premium on Gold and Cheapness of Silver</p>
<p>According to a news report from the Continental Daily News, India has a large stock of cotton yarn piece goods. Recently, due to the strike of British yarn factories, there has been no cargo shipped, so there is a gradual shortage. Shanghai yarn factories are taking this opportunity to promote their goods because the exchange rate is particularly favorable for export trade due to the premium on gold and cheapness of silver. Therefore, Shanghai yarn can be exported to India.</p>
<h3>The Consolidated Tax Administration Issued a Notice Yesterday</h3>
<p>Implementation of Collection Starts Today</p>
<p>The Consolidated Tax Administration of the Ministry of Finance issued Notice No. 1 yesterday, stating: (The regulations on the consolidated tax on cotton yarn, matches, and cement have been promulgated and implemented by the National Government. It is now decided that the collection will begin on February 1st. All Chinese and foreign merchants, except for goods already in stock that have been reported and inspected and given a certificate, and on which a certificate has been affixed, will be allowed to pay the customs duty on imitation machine-made foreign goods and be exempt from paying the consolidated tax before February 16th. After that, all cotton yarn, matches, and cement must comply with the promulgated regulations and pay the consolidated tax at the tariff rate at the customs or factory, and no concealment or evasion will be allowed, which would lead to investigation. However, when transporting goods for sale, each management office and inspection sub-office should immediately release whole packages of cotton yarn or cloth that have been completed the payment of the cotton yarn consolidated tax, and have printed numbers on the package surface, and have a tax payment certificate, as well as whole boxes of matches and whole barrels of cement that have a tax payment certificate, once they have been verified and should not be detained without reason, which would hinder transport and sale. This is hereby notified.)</p>
<h3>City Finance Committee Discussed City Business Tax Yesterday</h3>
<p>The City Finance Discussion Committee held its fourth regular meeting and second meeting at the City Minggong Yushi Society at 2:00 PM yesterday to discuss the collection of city business tax. The committee members present included Shen Tianxin, Li Quanshi, Xu Peikun, Wang Xiaolai, Zhu Hao, Xu Jiyu, Wang Yansong, Qian Xinzhi, Xu Shengchan, Yu Hongjun (represented by Zhu Hao), Qin Runqing, Ye Huijun, Pan Xulun, and Xu Yongzuo, as well as Tang Naikang, Director of the City Finance Bureau. Wang Xiaolai chaired the meeting, which adjourned at 6:15 PM. It is reported that as a result of the discussion, the 23 articles of the draft collection regulations and the 16 articles of the implementing rules drafted by the City Finance Bureau were revised and passed. The draft tax rate was not discussed due to the late hour. It is reported that the passed cases will be submitted to the Mayor for approval by the Finance Bureau.</p>
<h3>Various Industries Appeal for Lower Business Tax</h3>
<p>Ham Industry: The Ham Industry Association recently stated that the Jiangsu Province's promulgated business tax regulations list ham as a category subject to a tax rate of 15 per thousand. The intention is to regard ham as a luxury item. Therefore, the association convened a general meeting of all industry representatives the other day. More than 80 representatives, including Zhan Zhiliang, Guan Ruqing, Zhang Ziyuan, and Xu Renming, attended, and each had opinions to express. Generally, they believed that ham is a product made from fresh meat and pickled for the purpose of long-term storage. It is not comparable to leisure tonics, etc., and is even more equivalent in nature to pickled dried fish, which is an ordinary food item. Now, because it is regarded as a luxury, the tax rate is increased, and the disparity between the tax rate for pickled dried fish is too great. After discussion, it was decided to submit the detailed situation to the City Chamber of Commerce and the various industry tax committees to forward it to the central government for tax reduction.</p>
<p>Candle Industry: The Candle Industry Association appealed for a reduction in the business tax. They sent a letter to the City Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating: "In order to sincerely request the forwarding of the true situation for a reduction in the business tax rate, it is planned to implement the collection starting on February 10th, and the tax rate for incense and candles is set at 10 per thousand, etc. After reading it, we were shocked and at a loss. The marketing of incense and candles in our industry is small, but the labor costs are heavier than other industries. For example, the sales of candles are ten yuan (this is an assumed number, and the average daily sales of each store is no more than four or five yuan), of which the raw material cost is seven yuan, and the labor cost is one yuan. The remaining surplus, after deducting food, wages, rent, and miscellaneous expenses, has little or nothing left. Now, according to the newly determined tax rate standard, a tax fee of 10 cents must be levied, and the businessmen are operating with difficulty, and the result is that they have no profit to gain every day. How can they not be heartbroken? Moreover, the raw materials for incense and candles are purely domestic products. At present, the price of gold is soaring, and kerosene and the like are increasing endlessly. If we can help its development to save the application of the middle and lower classes, it may be enough to slightly fill the gaps."</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>"Adding to the people's strength depends on the government's intention to promote industry and encourage local goods. It is not appropriate to levy heavy taxes, which would hinder its development. Furthermore, the outline of the business tax previously formulated by the Ministry of Finance stipulates that the maximum shall not exceed 2 per thousand. Now, the provincial governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang levy a sudden increase of ten times on the products of our industry, which is not only a discrepancy between government orders, but also greatly contrary to the principle of people's livelihood. At this time, when the authorities are vigorously cutting down on the elimination of wasteful administration, our businessmen, in addition to being ashamed of their poverty, should, for the sake of making up for the loss of the national treasury, of course comply with the order to bear the burden. However, among the businessmen, there are still special difficulties, such as our industry. We should ask the provincial and municipal governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang to give extra consideration to this. In short, our industry's patriotism does not lag behind others. We should fulfill our obligations to the best of our ability. The new business tax regulations promulgated by the provincial governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang should be considered in accordance with the orders of the Ministry. It is not appropriate to be slightly biased. The highest limit should not exceed 2 per thousand, which would endanger the poor industry and commerce. We dare not be silent, so we hereby sincerely request that your association quickly forward the matter to the provincial governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang regarding this newly ordered collection of the incense and candle industry tax, and that the original proposed standards should be greatly reduced so that they do not exceed 2 per thousand, which would endanger the poor industry and commerce. The industry is very fortunate and the people's livelihood is very fortunate. Sincerely presented to the Tax Regulations Committee of the City Chamber of Commerce."</p>
<p>Embroidery Industry: The Embroidery Industry Association telegraphed to the Executive Yuan Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Industry in Nanjing, stating: "Cutting down on likin and adding taxes has been the hope of merchants for a long time, like a cloud dew in a great drought. Now, our government is resolutely implementing it, and all our merchants are happily rejoicing, thinking that since they indirectly bear the burden of adding taxes, they can directly breathe a sigh of relief from likin. How can we expect that in order to supplement the income of provincial governments from likin and surcharges, the business tax is organized according to the central government's regulations of 2 per thousand, which merchants are still reluctant to bear? However, our embroidery industry is actually being taxed as much as 15 per thousand. The tax collectors are exceeding the rate set by the central government, and what can the taxpayers do? Moreover, the embroidery industry has been declining, which is far different from the past. The industry is feeling overwhelmed, and the facts are very obvious. The government has always been generous and will definitely be able to provide legal aid and relief. Moreover, there are many who rely on this handicraft for their livelihood, but there are very few who set up shop for this business. As for the areas of production, there are only three places in Shanghai, Suzhou, and Hunan. Therefore, the total number of people affected by the business tax is even more meager. We humbly request that you order compliance with the outline promulgated by the ministry, which should not exceed 2 per thousand at most. In order to wholeheartedly support the government, the merchants should recognize and pay the tax with pain. The telegram cannot express the fear and awe of awaiting orders." The association also sent a letter to the Shanghai City Trade Associations Research Tax Regulations Committee (omitted).</p>
<p>Representative of Overseas Chinese Expelled from Mexico</p>
<h3>Returned to Shanghai from Beijing Last Night</h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Promised to Handle Negotiations</p>
<p>The 29 overseas Chinese who were expelled from Mexico this time arrived in Shanghai on the "American" ship. Representatives Chen Yaoyuan and three other representatives, as well as Mr. Yu Yonghe, landed and reported to the Shanghai office of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. They then went to Beijing to petition. The representatives arrived in Shanghai by train from Beijing at 6:00 PM yesterday (the 31st). They will stay in Shanghai for a few days and leave Shanghai by the Great China Company ship on the 4th of this month to return to Guangdong. The process of being expelled and petitioning is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Process of Being Expelled: There are a total of 29 people who were expelled from Mexico and returned to the country. Some served in the resident party branch in Mexico, some worked in the education field, and some were engaged in industry and commerce, but all were Cantonese. The Mexican government has been very anti-Chinese in recent years. Last year, the government strictly enforced the policy. When overseas Chinese were traveling, they would deliberately create conflicts by checking their residence permits and arbitrarily arresting overseas Chinese. This was a despicable tactic rarely seen in other countries, but it was used in Mexico without any scruples. On December 8th last year, immigration officials and police went to the port of Canali to check the residence permits of overseas Chinese. Unexpectedly, the officials forcibly confiscated them and even threatened to tear them up at any time. We were expelled from Mexico and immediately imprisoned in a small house dozens of miles away from Canali Port. We were searched one by one, and we were detained three times a day, so that other overseas Chinese in the port could not know. They regarded us as kidnappers. Later, we were escorted to Lai Ma Port, where local overseas Chinese found out and sent representatives with bedding and food to comfort us. However, the prison officials confiscated the items and imprisoned the representatives at the same time. We went on a hunger strike for two days. Their methods were so cruel that they can be said to be the most tragic in the world. Later, the overseas Chinese in Mibu Port saw that the representatives were imprisoned and could not provide relief, so they used thousands of dollars to bribe the prison officials, and the representatives were released. At that time, a similar expulsion of overseas Chinese occurred in Luo Wuzhu Port. There were originally four people expelled, but at a train station in the middle of the journey, an overseas Chinese who was going to another port to buy goods was arrested, and when they arrived at the Duo Lu Port of Yizi City, two more people were arrested. In total, 29 people were arrested in each port. The overseas Chinese heard the news and ran around calling for help, but to no avail. They asked our country's consul in Mexico, Peng Yaoxiang, to go to negotiate, but the immigration officials there were so rude that they refused to see him and forced the overseas Chinese to sign and fingerprint with a gun. Those who refused were beaten by the prison officials. When the expelled overseas Chinese ship arrived at Dabu Port, there were people returning from Cali who said that after Lei Xuelie, Lei Shouping, and others were arrested, their stores were looted by the local gentry, and their houses were burned down. There are now nearly 30,000 or 40,000 overseas Chinese from our country in Mexico, and their lives and property are under violent oppression. Therefore, this time, they returned to the country to petition in Beijing to negotiate with the Mexican authorities.</p>
<p>Petitioning in Beijing: The four representatives of the expelled overseas Chinese and Mr. Yu went to the Shanghai Bureau of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and reported. They then prepared a document and went to the Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission in Beijing to petition for negotiations. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission considered that the matter concerned international face and reported the situation to the National Government to instruct the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate seriously.</p>
<h3>Dr. Monroe Visited Song Ziwen for Advice</h3>
<p>Will Visit with Guo Bingwen Tomorrow Morning</p>
<p>Leaving Shanghai on the 4th for Hong Kong and Guangdong</p>
<p>Dr. Monroe, who recently came to China from the United States, attended the meeting of the China Education and Culture Foundation Committee in Shanghai and went north with Mr. Stuart Frost, the president of Yanjing University. The other day, he visited Minister of Finance Song Ziwen with Dr. Guo Bingwen (who returned to Shanghai from Pingming and will give a speech at the invitation of the Pan-Pacific Conference tomorrow morning on the 2nd) to discuss a certain important matter. When Mr. Guo visited Minister Wang yesterday, he originally planned to invite Mr. Wang to go with him, but because Mr. Wang was in a hurry to return to his hometown, he changed his plan and sent Liu Yunle to represent him. It is reported that Dr. Monroe is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 4th for Hong Kong and then go to Guangdong to inspect Lingnan University and the University of Hong Kong, and then return to Shanghai and go to Japan. Mr. Meng has visited Chairman Chiang several times and discussed education issues in detail.</p>

<h3>Pan Gongzhan Talked about the Extended Implementation of the Factory Law</h3>
<p>Factory Survey Continues</p>
<p>Labor Law Decided to be Temporarily Postponed</p>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency specially visited Pan Gongzhan, Director of the City Social Affairs Bureau, regarding the extension of the implementation of the Factory Law. The interview is recorded as follows: (Question) I heard that the central government has extended the implementation of the Factory Law by six months. Has your bureau also received a clear order? (Answer) We have not yet received a clear order, but today's newspapers reported that the eighth National Government meeting has already decided to extend the implementation to August 1st, which is a confirmed fact. (Question) I heard that your bureau convened a discussion with industrial representatives in the city and sent personnel to conduct on-site surveys because the Factory Law was implemented. Will it continue to be handled after the extended implementation? (Answer) The Factory Law has been promulgated for many years, and the factories involved should have prepared for it long ago. However, according to the discussions and surveys conducted by our bureau this time, we deeply know that not many factories in the city fully understand the meaning of the Factory Law, let alone the equipment and other matters. This is because most citizens usually do not pay much attention to government laws and regulations. Now the central government has decided to extend the implementation, or it may have taken this into consideration. However, the six-month period will expire soon. If it is still the same at that time, how can the central government allow another extension? Therefore, our bureau has decided to continue the survey in order to understand the actual situation of each factory in the city. On the one hand, we can take this opportunity to guide the factories to prepare for implementation, so as not to say that they are too late to prepare when the time comes. (Question) I saw in the newspaper that the city government would instruct your bureau to stop the four provisional labor laws and regulations in this city because the implementation of the Factory Law was scheduled, and ordered you to formulate separate laws and regulations for small factories that are not applicable to the Factory Law. How will we handle it now that the implementation of the Factory Law has been extended? (Answer) Since the implementation of the Factory Law has been extended, the four provisional labor laws and regulations previously promulgated in this city will continue to be valid and will not be abolished at the end of January. We have already received instructions from the city government on this point and will comply with them. As for the separate laws and regulations, whether they are formulated in advance or not, their promulgation and implementation date should be the same as the implementation date of the Factory Law.</p>
<h3>Special News from the Shipping Industry</h3>
<p>Sino-American Joint Shipping: Yesterday, the Japanese-language newspaper in this city reported that the long-rumored establishment of a new shipping company in cooperation between China and the United States has now been investigated and found that the proposed routes are: first, the Shanghai-Hankou Yangtze River route, then the Hankou-Yichang upper Yangtze River route, then the Shanghai-Tianjin North China route, and then the Shanghai-Hong Kong and Guangdong South China route. The ships used to start the routes will be supplied by the American Dollar Steamship Line, and the shipping rights will be managed by Chinese merchants. Most of the Chinese parties undertaking this new shipping business are from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. This move by American businessmen is a private action and has nothing to do with the government. It is now reported that the two parties, China and the United States, are in the process of negotiations, and the date of realization has not yet been announced.</p>
<p>British Ships Deal with Sichuan Merchants: The British-owned Taikoo Company's upper Yangtze River ships "Jie Ding" and "Xiu Shan" ran aground in Chenglingji in November last year. The shipowners were afraid of being robbed by bandits, so they threw the goods into the river to escape. Afterwards, the merchants demanded that Taikoo Company compensate them. After much negotiation, the matter was not resolved, and the two ships were detained by Sichuan merchants. At the same time, it was agreed that if the matter was not resolved, the Sichuanese would stop loading goods, which contained the nature of resistance. Recently, it was reported that in order to maintain its shipping business, the British merchants have changed their methods and leased the "Jie Ding" and "Xiu Shan" ships to Chinese people to operate. On the surface, they do not belong to Taikoo, but in fact, they have changed to a back-office boss. In this way, the loss of resistance can be avoided in a transfer, and the issue of compensation for abandoned goods is still under negotiation.</p>
<p>New Yunnan Ship in Distress: In November last year, the New Yunnan, a ship owned by the Two Lakes Special Tax Bureau, was carrying tobacco and various items when it ran aground in Diaoguan. All the tobacco and various items on the ship were robbed by bandits, and the crew members were also kidnapped by the bandits. Only an empty ship was left and abandoned in the river for more than three months. Recently, the kidnapped crew members have been released from the bandits' den and have gone to Yichang to find a way to send a small ship to Diaoguan to tow the New Yunnan. It was not until yesterday that it was rescued and came to Shanghai. It is now reported that the ship will first purchase and equip the lost items in Shanghai and then undergo a major overhaul. This time, the loss of cargo and the ship body of the New Yunnan is estimated to be between 300,000 and 400,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Yu Shun Steamship Runs Aground: The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Yu Shun steamship was traveling from Shanghai to Guangdong via Xiamen, but when the ship was approaching Dashizha, four miles from Guangzhou, it encountered fog. The ship mistook its direction in the fog and ran aground. Yesterday, the Shanghai Bureau received this news and telegraphed the Guangdong Bureau to send a ship to tow it as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>National Goods Community Welcomes Inspection Team Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Factory United Association received a telegram yesterday from Zhou Guojun and Ye Youcai, the two leaders of the Inspection Team of the Nanyang Islands, stating that they were delayed in Hong Kong and will not arrive in Shanghai until the afternoon of tomorrow (the 2nd). The association has sent letters to the various factories to send personnel to the pier to welcome them at that time.</p>
<h3>Silk Factories Crave Silk Bonds</h3>
<p>Since January, the Shanghai foreign exchange silk market has been affected by the repurchasing of Shanghai white silk by Japanese merchants, coupled with the depreciation of exchange rates, and European and American merchants have started to sell their silk in droves. The price of silk has been rising steadily. The various manufacturers, in view of the relief bonds, have already convened a meeting of representatives of the industry in Shanghai by Deputy Finance Minister Zhang. The amount of bonds has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation, and has been fully supported by the financial community, which has provided loans for raw materials and started operations separately. In less than a month, the Shanghai silk factories have reported that they have reached four out of ten. Unexpectedly, in recent days, the price of silk has fallen sharply again. European sales have been sluggish, and the price of B-grade silk has fallen by more than 100 taels. The news about the bonds has been silent again. The various manufacturers have started to panic and have inquired about the situation with the industry association. If the bonds are delayed again, the factories that have already started operations will be difficult to support, and those that have not started operations may have no hope of resuming operations. Shen Huachen, the chairman of the Silk Factory Industry Association, is preparing to urge the Ministry of Industry to issue the bonds as soon as possible to maintain the silk industry.</p>
<h3>City Public Security Bureau Seizes the Rickshaw Pullers' Labor Preparatory Committee</h3>
<p>Meng Jinchen, Chen Jintang, He Wushan, and others set up a rickshaw pullers' labor preparatory committee in the Zhabei Laoximen French Concession. The Civic Training Association immediately sent staff to investigate and found that the founders of the industry were mixed with people outside the industry. They sent a letter to the City Public Security Bureau to seal up all the preparatory offices separately. The various situations have been reported in previous newspapers. It is now learned that the City Public Security Bureau has ordered the various rickshaw pullers' labor union preparatory offices and preparatory committees, etc., to be sealed up separately.</p>
<h3>Investigation of Trafficking of Women and Children Can Contact Customs</h3>
<p>Reply from the Water Patrol to the Social and Public Security Bureaus</p>
<p>The Social and Public Security Bureaus stated that the International Federation's investigation of the trafficking of women and children is about to come to China to investigate the situation of trafficking in women and children in the East. Protecting humanity is of great importance. They specially sent a letter to the Customs Water Patrol to collect relevant materials for compilation and supply to the group for reference. Chief Wu of the Water Patrol approved the letter and immediately requested instructions from the Customs Port Director. He then received an order to the effect that the bureau could directly contact the Customs Tax Department to investigate the matter, which would be more familiar. The chief of the patrol sent a letter to the two bureaus yesterday, explaining the situation for their reference.</p>

<h3>Municipal Health Bureau to Prepare for the Establishment of the Zhabei Clinic</h3>
<p>Opening Soon</p>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau, in light of the large number of common people in the city, had long planned to establish thirty free clinics throughout the city for relief and widespread benefit. However, due to the lack of funds in the municipal treasury, the plan was delayed. Recently, considering the pressing needs of the common people near the Zhabei Sun Temple area, it was decided to urgently establish the first free clinic at the old site of the Zhabei Office on Minli Road in Zhabei. Preparations are being actively made, and it is expected to open before February 10th. Experienced doctors will be sent to preside over the clinic. It is tentatively scheduled to be open every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday from 9:00 AM to 11:45 AM. Registration fees, medical fees, and medication fees will all be waived. Nurses will also be dispatched to visit patients' homes to check on their condition and provide guidance on various health knowledge and treatment plans, greatly benefiting the common people of Zhabei.</p>
<h3>Fuyuan Hall Tenants' Rent Reduction Movement</h3>
<p>Requesting 20% Off, Demanding 30% Off</p>
<p>And Immediate Return of Small Rents</p>
<p>The properties on Fen'guan Ma Road, Dexing, Zhizhong, and Lixian Streets in the French Concession belong to Tongren Fuyuan Hall. After the Hall announced a 20% rent reduction the other day, the tenants gathered and decided that the majority would reject the 20% offer. They insisted on the original demand of a 30% rent reduction and the return of the small rents. Previously, the French Concession Landlords' Association had submitted the same request to the Municipal Government for review and had already received a reply. The submitted petition and reply are recorded below: The petition is for Tongren Fuyuan Hall's private collection of small rents and high housing fees, requesting an order for the Hall to voluntarily refund. The petition states that the tenants of Dexing, Zhizhong, and Lixian Streets in the French Concession claim that Tongren Fuyuan Hall is the largest charitable organization in Shanghai. However, the current administrators of the Hall are violating the instructions of their predecessors by using the cemetery land east of Baxianqiao in the French Concession to build houses on Dexing, Zhizhong, and Lixian Streets, totaling over a hundred buildings. They are also arbitrarily collecting small rents and raising housing fees, which is opposed by the majority of tenants. Although using cemetery land to build residential houses is not entirely unacceptable, at a time when the concession authorities are increasing land taxes, landlords are adding rent, and all industries are declining, causing hardship for the people, any public welfare organization should not associate with unscrupulous merchants and monks who are solely focused on money, thereby deviating from the name of public welfare. Moreover, the French Concession authorities are already cracking down on the private collection of small rents and illegal rent increases. How can the Hall claim that it is making charitable donations and issuing receipts, leaving room for criticism? The monthly rent is even more shocking. Before 1919, the highest monthly rent for a city house was no more than 100 yuan. Now, the Hall's houses are renting for 150 yuan per month, causing other houses to rent for over 100 yuan. If the market is booming, then vacant houses account for two or three out of ten. If tenants voluntarily lease, then those who have already leased find it difficult to advance or retreat, and those who have not leased are deterred. It is obvious at a glance. The evolution of things must follow a natural process. Hasty advancement and rapid retreat have become an unchanging principle of the world. Pulling up seedlings to help them grow is not something that those who manage public welfare should do. Considering the Association's weak ability, it is clear that in today's world, only those who practice can compete for profit. In fact, there is no way to prevent private individuals from being greedy, but it cannot sit idly by and watch public welfare organizations be greedy and forget righteousness. Moreover, although the receipts issued by the Hall are not enough to convict it of illegality, the Association is determined not to expose the ugly side of famous public welfare organizations to outsiders. Therefore, it petitions the Municipal Government to order the Hall to voluntarily refund all small rents collected and reduce the housing fees to a reasonable level. The attached reply reads: Regarding the petition for Tongren Fuyuan Hall's private collection of fees and high rent on houses in Dexing, Zhizhong, and Lixian Streets, please order a voluntary concession. The petition has been received and will be forwarded to the bureau for instructions. This is the reply.</p>
<h3>Biscuit, Candy, and Canned Food Industries Raise Prices</h3>
<p>Effective Today</p>
<p>The Shanghai Biscuit, Candy, and Canned Food Industries Association issued a notice to its members regarding price increases: Notice: Upon investigation, although many of the raw materials used in our industry are produced domestically, such as sugar, spices, colors, and tinplate for cans, whether directly or indirectly, most of them are supplied by foreign goods. Recently, the price of gold has been high, and the import tax rate has been revised, resulting in huge costs. Not only is it difficult to make a profit, but also costs are being lost. In order to seek remedial measures and maintain capital, prices will be appropriately increased to provide support and resist the long-term drive of foreign goods to avoid overshadowing the host. Those who promote domestic goods should not haggle over this. It has been decided at the representative meeting on January 8th that, starting from February 1st, biscuit categories, regardless of coarse or fine, bulk or canned, canned food categories, meat, vegetables, fruits, and other items such as preserved tangerine peel, will all be increased by 10%. Candy categories, regardless of soft or hard and colors, in addition to the existing increase, will be increased by 20%. This notice is issued to all members to follow consistently to protect capital and maintain business. Special announcement.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing Fellow Villagers Association Convened a Council Meeting</h3>
<p>When the Shaoxing Seven Counties Sojourning in Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association previously held a council meeting, it passed a proposal to add a secretary and replace the clerks. All the clerks were greatly dissatisfied and petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau for protection. The Association decided to convene a council meeting today to discuss the case again. It is heard that some council members believe that the council's decision to add an extra secretary is unnecessary, as the Association's paperwork is not very heavy. Important documents have always been drafted by the secretary-general. Recently, Mr. Chen was hired to replace the former secretary-general, Mr. Zhang, so important documents can still be drafted by Mr. Chen. Why cause unnecessary changes and cause all sorts of disputes? It is inappropriate to dismiss staff for no reason. It is proposed to express opposition to the council's proposal at today's meeting.</p>

<h3>Zheng Xitang Valiantly Fought Off Kidnappers</h3>
<p>Disarmed the Bandit's Gun</p>
<p>Threw It into the Huangpu River</p>
<p>Two Bandits Fled, One Bandit Captured</p>
<p>Rickshaw Puller Suspected and Detained</p>
<p>At around 11:00 AM yesterday, a violent robbery and attempted kidnapping occurred on Jichang Street in the Nanshi Hugujunying area. The victim was Zheng Xitang, a Ningbo native and general manager of the Laogongmao Inland Shipping Bureau on Beijing Road. As a result, Zheng escaped on the spot, fortunately avoiding danger. One bandit was shot and captured. The detailed circumstances are recorded below:</p>
<p>Zheng Xitang's Unsettled Lifestyle Zheng Xitang (courtesy name Huatang), a wealthy merchant from Ningbo, is 38 years old. He currently serves as the general manager of the Laogongmao Inland Shipping Bureau at 178 Beijing Road in the Public Concession and the Pingan Shipping Company at 78 Waitan in Nanshi. However, Laogongmao has a shipyard located near Bailianjing Lao Baidu in Pudong, so Zheng's residence is uncertain. He either lives at the shipyard or resides on Beijing Road, and sometimes even stays at his eldest son's house. Zheng has two sons. The eldest, Jin Chen (courtesy name Zhaojiu), is 23 years old and assists his father in handling various matters. He currently lives at Fangbang Bridge in Nanshi. The youngest son, Yichen, is only two years old and still in diapers.</p>
<p>Granddaughter Was Once Kidnapped Zheng has a car for transportation due to his busy work schedule. Because of his status, his behavior is inevitably extravagant, which has been coveted by bandits. Last spring, Zheng's eldest son, Zhaojiu, and granddaughter, Xingjuan, encountered danger in front of the Wuben Girls' School on Nanji Que Road.</p>
<p>As a result, his son escaped into the school due to his agility, but his granddaughter, Xingjuan, was kidnapped and eventually redeemed with money. Unexpectedly, within a year, bandits coveted Zheng himself.</p>
<p>Went to Puxi at Noon Yesterday After his granddaughter was kidnapped, Zheng hired two bodyguards to take precautions, each equipped with a handgun for emergencies. Yesterday morning, around 10:00 AM, Zheng went to the office on Beijing Road and then crossed the river to the shipyard at Lao Baidu for inspection. Before leaving, he only took bodyguard Wang Yusheng (a 26-year-old Tianjin native who has been employed for nearly two years). After the inspection, around 11:00 AM, he planned to return to Puxi for lunch at the Pingan Shipping Company. He temporarily hired a sampan and crossed the river with his bodyguard to the wharf on Jichang Street in Nanshi.</p>
<p>Three Kidnappers Jumped Out on the Road After the sampan was docked, Zheng and Wang landed together. Wang walked in front, and Zheng followed behind. Unexpectedly, only about a hundred steps away from the wharf, near the stack of materials, three kidnappers suddenly jumped out from the roadside. Two bandits first stopped Wang Yusheng, pulled out guns to scare him into silence, and seized his No. 34923 self-defense handgun. At that time, Zheng was only about ten steps away. Seeing this situation, he knew that he had encountered bandits and quickly turned back to run towards the riverbank, hoping to take the original sampan to escape.</p>
<p>Zheng Slipped, Bandits Opened Fire, Bodyguard Was Supervised by Two Bandits Completely Lost Resistance, Standing Still on the Riverbank Waiting for Disposal. The other bandit saw the hostage turn around to escape and pulled out his gun to chase after him. Unexpectedly, Zheng rushed to the wharf and was about to go down the steps when it happened to be drizzling at the time. The ground was muddy, wet, and slippery. In a panic, he suddenly slipped and fell to the ground. The bandit saw him fall and fired a shot at him. The bullet hit his left sleeve, pierced a hole, and the bullet fell on Zheng's side on a yellow paper book, so the skin was not injured.</p>
<p>Disarmed the Bandit, Valiantly Fought Zheng saw the bandit open fire and jumped up in a hurry, pouncing on the bandit and grabbing the bandit's hands. He snatched the bandit's handgun and threw it into the muddy riverbank. Seeing the bandit without a handgun, Zheng became more courageous and fought the bandit. At the same time, the two bandits who were monitoring the bodyguard on the shore suddenly heard the gunshot and knew that something was wrong. They abandoned Wang and ran to the covered car parked by the roadside, accelerating away.</p>
<p>Bandit Pretended to Be Calm When the two bandits were boarding the car, shouts for capture were heard. Jin Yujiu, a volunteer policeman from a nearby factory, heard the alarm and rushed out with a gun. Fifty steps away from the car, he first identified the car number and fired a shot at the same time. However, the car was moving too fast to catch up. At that time, the bandit who was chasing Zheng saw that the car had gone far and there was no way to escape. He pretended to be calm, put his hands in his coat pockets, pretended to take out a gun, and walked forward calmly. Unexpectedly, the bodyguard observed very clearly and secretly followed him, waiting for an appropriate location to capture him.</p>
<p>Bandit Was Finally Intercepted Wang secretly followed the bandit for dozens of steps and met policeman Jin Yujiu. The two of them stepped forward together to intercept him. At the same time, Gao Hongbin, a patrol officer from the Gaochangmiao branch of the Second District Headquarters, had heard the alarm and rushed to the scene with the police. He first detained the bandit and brought him to the office. Then, he went to the riverside to check and found the handgun abandoned by the bandit. The gun number was 86562. After Gao, the patrol officer, finished checking, he brought Zheng and Wang to the office to inquire about the details and reported to the Second District Headquarters by telephone.</p>
<p>Car Found in Lujiawan At that time, according to Wang Yusheng and policeman Jin Yujiu, the bandit's car was a covered white-牌营业 car with the number 17963 (City 885). However, it was impossible to distinguish the authenticity in detail. Wang, the district chief, sent detective Cao Jun達 to search around on a motorcycle. Unexpectedly, while patrolling to the front door of the French General Patrol House in Lujiawan, the car with that number was found parked on the roadside. He entered the patrol house to state the case. The car driver had already reported to the patrol house.</p>
<p>The Situation of the Bandit Renting the Car Detective Cao then clarified the situation to the patrol house. The patrol chief handed the driver and the car over to the detective to take directly to the Second District Headquarters. After Wang, the district chief, questioned him in detail, the car driver confessed his name was Wu Genyou, 33 years old, from Cixi, Zhejiang. He is now a car driver at Xinghua Automobile Company at 2 Youheng Road. This morning (yesterday morning), a customer in a suit, about 30 years old, suddenly came and said that he needed to hire a car to go to various places. The rent was calculated at three yuan per hour. The accountant ordered me to drive a Chevrolet covered car with the number 17693.</p>
<p>Agreed to Wait for One Hour First, the car was driven to the vicinity of Pingjili Road, Nanyang Bridge in the French Concession, and stopped. Then, there was another man in a suit and a man in a Zhongshan suit who got on the car and ordered to drive to Beijing Road. The car arrived at the south end of Shanxi Road on Beijing Road and stopped again. The three men got off the car and entered the alley. About half an hour later, the three men got back on the car and ordered to drive to Hugujunying in the 16th Pu, stopping near a small wharf on Jichang Street. A man in a suit said to me that they had something to do across the river and would be back in about an hour, ordering me to wait there.</p>
<p>Escaped on Fuxing Road Unexpectedly, within half an hour, two men in suits suddenly rushed into the car and pointed a gun at me, ordering me to drive straight forward at full speed. At that time, I was threatened by the power and had to obey. Unexpectedly, about fifty steps after the car drove, a gunshot was heard behind me, and shouts of robbery were heard. As for whether the bandits in the car returned the gun at the time, I was too frightened to distinguish it in detail. Afterwards, the car passed the Xiejiao and turned into the French Concession, from Xujiahui Road to Lujiawan, all the way to Xiafei Road, heading west to the vicinity of Fuxing Road. They ordered to stop the car, and the two bandits got out of the car and fled. I drove the car to Lujiawan to report, and so on.</p>
<p>The Captured Bandit Was Injured After Wang, the district chief, finished questioning, because the car driver had been driving for the bandits for several hours, he was completely unaware. Especially when the car arrived at the Jichang Street wharf, the bandits claimed to him that they had to go across the river for an hour and ordered him to wait a little while, and the car fare was not paid at all. The car driver rashly agreed, which was very suspicious. He ordered him to be detained temporarily for investigation. After questioning, he ordered the intercepted bandit to be brought in. Unexpectedly, the bandit's chin had been shot into a hole, pierced through the right neck, and two lower teeth were knocked out. Blood was flowing like a stream, and he could not speak at all. Wang, the district chief, had no choice but to order him to be detained temporarily and interrogated after he recovered from his injuries. However, it has not yet been determined who injured the bandit.</p>
<h3>Bandit Leader, Wang Biezui, Arrested</h3>
<p>Seven More Bandits Arrested at the Same Time</p>
<p>Crimes Too Numerous to Remember</p>
<p>Shu Xiaogou Has Already Been Killed</p>
<p>Wang Changgeng, a detective from the Laozha Police Station, cracked a kidnapping gang and arrested eight bandits. It was briefly recorded in yesterday's newspaper. Now, we will continue to report the details of the cracking and the various kidnapping cases committed by the bandits.</p>
<p>Shu Xiaogou, a Rich Household in Ningbo, Kidnapped Shu Xiaogou, a rich household in the Gaoxie area of the Zhoushan countryside in Ningbo, was kidnapped by bandits on the night of November 9th of the lunar calendar. Shu's son, Mingting, successively received six letters from the bandits demanding a ransom of 20,000 yuan. In order to redeem the ticket, he could go to Shanghai for negotiations. Mingting urgently wanted to get his father out of trouble and immediately took a boat to Shanghai, temporarily staying in an inn. He had negotiated with the bandits several times, but because the ransom had not yet been settled, his father was still in the bandit's lair.</p>
<p>Two Bandits Captured in Dingsheng Inn The fact that the bandits were hiding in Room 15 of the Laodingsheng Inn at 699 Fujian Road was detected by Wang Changgeng, a detective from the Laozha Police Station. He led detectives Liu Junqing, Shi Yingjie, and others to secretly go to the address at 3:00 PM the day before, only capturing Yu Jinf发, a Ningbo native. Suspecting that there were accomplices outside, he brought Yu into the police station and sent detectives to guard the room. As a result, Ni Ronggao was subsequently captured. The two bandits, Yu and Ni, fully admitted to the Shu kidnapping case.</p>
<p>The Bandit Leader Is Also Known as Wang Biezui and also supplied that their leader, named Wang Zhixiang, also known as Wang Biezui, also from Ningbo, was hiding in Room 17 of the Lingnan Hotel at 5 Wuchang Road. The detective immediately went to the address to arrest the leader. Cao Tongyu, Cao Xingzhang, Zou Jierui, Xia Zicheng, Zhao Ayu, and others in the same place were all arrested.</p>
<p>More Than Seventy Gang Members After being brought back to the police station for a brief investigation, it was learned that the so-called kidnapping leader, Wang Zhixiang, was indeed the ringleader. Two years ago, in the case of more than seventy bandits captured on Dixiwei Road, all of them were Wang's gang members. The police station had been hunting them for a long time, but because their whereabouts were secretive, they could not find any clues. This time, after being arrested, the bandit knew that his crimes were full and it was difficult to escape the law. Therefore, when the captain asked about the cases he had committed, he did not hide it at all and confessed one by one.</p>
<p>Eight Major Cases Committed in His Life Because the crimes he committed in his life were too numerous to remember, he could not list them all. Of the ones left in his mind, there were about eight cases: (1) Kidnapping Bei Runsheng, a wealthy paint merchant, for a ransom of 250,000 yuan. He received 3,000 gold. (2) Kidnapping Wang Yitai on Qiujiang Road for a ransom of 70,000 yuan. He received 10,005 yuan. (4) Kidnapping Shi Jiufeng on Xinjihang Road (5) Kidnapping a compradore of Sanbing Foreign Firm on Xizang Road (6) Kidnapping a silk factory owner in Lujiawan (7) Kidnapping the owner of Cai Tongmao Glass Shop on Gongping Road (8) Kidnapping a Cantonese student on Bazhi Road. For the ransom of each case from the fourth to the eighth, and how much he shared, he had forgotten everything.</p>
<p>Eight Bandits Sent to Court Yesterday Morning Yesterday morning, the police station sent these eight bandits to the Special District Local Court. Judge Zhou Hanting interrogated them. Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer from the police station, stated that the various kidnapping cases were still under investigation. Only the illegal association under Article 161 of the Criminal Law was prosecuted. Detective Wang reported the process of arresting the bandits and submitted the confession of the eight cases admitted by bandit Wang at the police station.</p>
<p>The Kidnapping of Shu Xiaogou However, because Shu Xiaogou, who was kidnapped, had not escaped danger, his son-in-law, Ding Maofa, went to court to state the circumstances of his father-in-law's abduction, saying that when the bandits arrived at his father-in-law's house, the bandits first shot the dog to death because the dog barked. They then destroyed the door of his father-in-law's house with stones and went inside to abduct his father-in-law. His wife's brother, Shu Mingting, happened to be away from home, otherwise he would have been kidnapped as well.</p>
<p>Shu Xiaogou Was Already Killed Afterwards, according to Yu Jinf发's confession, before kidnapping Shu, Ni Ronggao discussed it in a tea house on Sanma Road, and I was pushed to be the guide because I was familiar with the route. I did not advance when I was about to arrive at Shu's house, and Ni and others went to kidnap. I have not met since then. I really don't know where the hostage is hidden. Ni Ronggao confessed that Shu Xiaogou was taken by the two fleeing bandits, Ding and Chen, with weapons. Since there was no way to hire a boat for transportation after they succeeded, they shot the hostage and abandoned the body in a coffin next to the Land Temple, two miles away from Xujiacun, Zhoushan. Wang did not hear about this. Wang was in Hankou at that time, and Ding informed him by letter and invited Wang to Shenyun.</p>
<p>Wang Zhixiang Was in the Business of Kidnapping Continuing to question Wang Zhixiang, the bandit claimed that he was in the business of kidnapping and had committed many cases that could not be listed in detail. There were many accomplices, most of whom had returned to their hometowns. Although the Shu case was not done by me, the letter demanding the ransom was written by me and was really an accomplice. The bandit also said that I did not want to burden others and did not deny it. People like Zou Jierui, Xia Zicheng, Zhao Ayu, and Cao Xingzhang were not involved in any of the cases. He requested that they be released to avoid harming innocent people. Judge Zhou questioned the remaining defendants and ordered the defendants to be sent back to prison for another fourteen days of interrogation. He also asked the police station to take a bandit to search for Shu's body near Shu's family and report to the local official for inspection.</p>
<h3>Recent News on the Construction of the Pujiang Railway Bridge</h3>
<p>There is No Definite Funding Plan</p>
<p>The Municipal Government is Still Reviewing</p>
<p>The Municipal Government recently received a petition from business representatives Yao Jizhong, Xu Qingwen, and others, requesting approval to invest in the construction of a Huangpu River railway bridge at Dongjiadu in South Shanghai to facilitate Pudong's transportation and develop commerce. Considering the significance of this matter, if it can be handled properly, it will be of great help to the development of Pudong. It immediately ordered the Public Works Bureau to conduct a detailed review. In order to clarify the truth,</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>it is heard that it will send a letter to invite the initiators for a conversation. The key to this matter lies entirely in whether there is a solid grasp of funding. Other projects are secondary issues. However, it is learned that the cost of the bridge is estimated at more than 3.5 million yuan. In addition to the start-up costs already recognized by the initiators, no cash has been raised. It is said that the remaining funds will be guaranteed by the Dalian 銀團團 in the future. The Dalian 銀團團 has not been registered and is said to be Huaqiao equity. Its representative is Xu Qingwen, the initiator of the bridge construction. The submitted engineering drawings are also very simple and cannot be reviewed. It is heard that the Public Works Bureau has reported this situation to the Municipal Government.</p>
<h3>Bandits and Enemies on a Narrow Road</h3>
<p>Suddenly Met as Strangers</p>
<p>The Enmity of Cut Ears Is Unforgettable</p>
<p>Gu Xuewen, a 53-year-old Chongming native, has been engaged in farming and has a wealthy economy of fields and houses, which has been coveted by bandits. In the spring of the 19th year of the Republic of China, he received threatening letters, demanding three thousand yuan as a extortion fee. If he did not agree, he would set fire to Gu's house. Gu valued money more than his life and ignored them. Unexpectedly, on June 23rd of that year, when Gu was going to the fields to cultivate, he was abducted by bandits Jiang Sihe and others when he passed through the Stone Sand area of Chongming. He was forced to pay a ransom within a time limit. Gu was afraid of being threatened and had to exhaust his family's wealth to take the money to redeem him. Gu's wife had no choice but to ask her neighbors Zhang Genfa and Gong Wangshi to carry 1,020 yuan to the bandit's lair and hand them over to Wang Yu'ao. Unexpectedly, the bandits were not satisfied with their desires and, in anger, cut off Gu's left ear and drove him into the wilderness late at night. Gu lost a lot of money and suffered heavy injuries. He was so angry that he wanted to vent his hatred, but the bandits had already fled and could not be arrested. Unexpectedly, after a year, he suddenly received a secret report from a friend that Wang Yu'ao, who collected the money at the time, was now living at No. 1506 Tailai Li, Haining Road, Zhabei. Gu took witnesses Gong Wangshi and Zhang Genfa by car to Shanghai and stayed at a客棧 in Xiejiao, Nanshi. At about 6:00 PM yesterday evening, when he was passing through Yaojia Stone Bridge on Datong Road in Zhabei, he suddenly met Wang Yu'ao on a narrow road. He called the twelfth watchman police officer Li Wenkang from the fourth district to arrest him and bring him to the office. Gu供禀了前情，要求严究诘之。 Wang's confession was hesitant. It was judged that the case was related to charges of abducting people and extorting ransoms. The important facts were to be investigated by the bureau.</p>

He encountered two thieves, each holding a handgun, who blocked the road and robbed him. Wang shouted loudly, and Wu A'er, a rickshaw puller who was pulling an empty car on the way, heard the sound and helped to chase after him. Finally, one thief was captured, and a handgun discarded by the thief was found in the mud pile by the roadside, containing seven bullets. However, the loot was taken away by another thief. A Chinese patrol officer No. 1968 also heard the sound and arrived. Wang handed the stolen weapon to the patrol officer and took him to the Pudu Road Police Station. According to the confession, his name was Chen Asi, also known as Zhang Shaolin, from Dachang. He used to work at the Neiwai Cotton Mill at No. 14 West Suzhou Road. Yesterday, he was sent to the Special District Local Court and interrogated by Judge Cheng. Wang stated the circumstances of the robbery and pointed out that Chen was one of the two thieves who held a handgun to prevent him from making a sound. The other thief robbed the money and fled first. Wu A'er also went to court to prove the situation of helping to chase the thief. When questioned, Chen盗尚图狡赖，谓伊因赴通益纱厂访友经过该处被拘等语。 Subsequently, the lawyer from the police station applied for a postponement to investigate the remaining accomplices. The court ordered the defendant to be detained for another seven days of interrogation.</p>
<h3>Cruelty of the Sea Bandits in Da'an Port</h3>
<p>Cutting Ears··· Cutting Noses··· Digging Eyes··· Gang Rape A certain Mr. Liu, a resident of the coastal area of ​​Hebei, was kidnapped by sea bandits to Da'an Port in October last year and has now been redeemed for 3,500 yuan. He came to Shanghai yesterday to briefly describe the situation of the bandit's lair. According to him, the bandits usually send people to the coastal areas to inquire about the wealthy residents and report back to the bandit leader. The bandit leader chooses a date and sends a team of dozens or hundreds of people to set off, no different from plainclothes soldiers. They first rob and then kidnap. The newly kidnapped tickets are divided and hidden in various places, either on ships or on the shore. When demanding money from the new tickets, they often cut the ears, cut the noses, and dig the eyes of the tickets that are not redeemed to show their power. If several people are bound in one family, they even send the cut ears and noses to their families to intimidate their families. Among the female tickets, if there are young and slightly attractive women, they will be gang raped, which is called opening the 條子. It is now heard that the Provincial Public Security Bureau has dispatched a large team of police officers to station in the coastal areas to protect the residents.</p>

Old stallholders must register with the Chinese Ratepayers' Association with their January notice, and the lottery will be held separately to determine the location. In addition, the Public Works Department has proposed three measures: (1) After the lottery, the Public Works Department will submit the list of stallholders to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association for review. If there are any fraudulent cases, the Ratepayers' Association will notify the Public Works Department. (2) After the lottery, each vegetable vendor will immediately submit their nameplate number to the Public Works Department. (3) The lottery will be held upstairs in the new market at 2:00 PM on February 3rd, and downstairs at 1:00 PM on February 4th.

<h3>Shanghai Soong Residents Oppose Quarrying at Tianma Mountain</h3>
<p>Last night, Songjiang natives residing in Shanghai, including Lei Mingjiu, hosted a banquet at the Dadong Hotel for all their fellow villagers, with over 300 people in attendance. Chairman Shen Zhiling first reported on the investigation, stating that the Tianma Mountain quarrying case in the county by Jiang Erchang was previously reported to the authorities by over 700 local residents, including Gu Shunhua. Chairman Jiang then ordered the former Jiangsu Civil Affairs Director Bian to investigate strictly and the Department of Agriculture and Mining to ban it entirely. Since Jiang Erchang's death, his wife, Jin Heying, and the stone merchant Cao Yunji have dared to deceive the authorities and continue quarrying before complying with the order to pay a large fine. The harm to local public welfare has already been reported in the newspapers and will not be reiterated.

<h3>Mastermind Behind the Assassination of the Flower Association King, Peng Fuxing, Tried Yesterday</h3>
<p>Trial Adjourned for Seven Days for Further Investigation</p>
<p>As reported yesterday, the suspect Peng, who assassinated Liu Lianghong, the "King of Flowers", was arrested at the Ningbo Hotel on Dongxin Bridge Street. Liu, originally named Xikang, died on the night of May 8th two years ago. On that day, foreign residents in Shanghai were attending the spring horse racing at the racetrack. Liu, who loved watching races, left at 6:00 PM after watching the event and took his car with his wife to the Lao Yutai Hotel on Yunnan Road for a drink. As they got out of the car at the entrance of the hotel, several assassins rushed out from the roadside, each holding a pistol, and opened fire on Liu, firing over a dozen shots. Liu was fatally wounded at the scene. The assassins fled. In July of that year, the police arrested seven suspects, including Zhang Guoqing, who were interrogated by the court. Zhang was confirmed as one of the participants in the assassination and sentenced to 15 years in prison. The others were released. During the interrogation of the seven, Kang Xingfa and Chen Falin both confessed that the mastermind behind the assassination of Liu was Peng Fuxing from Changzhou. The police dispatched detectives to Changzhou to arrest him but were unsuccessful until 9:00 PM the night before, when Wang Zhusheng, an investigation officer from the Jing'an Temple Police Station, and detective Shan Huihai received a tip that Peng was hiding at the hotel and secretly went to the hotel with detectives from the French Concession Police Station to arrest him.</p>
<p>He was escorted to the Special District Court yesterday morning and interrogated by Judge Cheng Shangfeng. Wang Yaotang, the police lawyer, requested an adjournment for further investigation and evidence collection. Peng, 40 years old, confessed that he ran the Ganshengtai rice shop in his hometown and had come to Shanghai from Changzhou a few days ago, staying in room number 9 of the Ningbo Hotel. He denied any knowledge of the assassination of Liu Lianghong and retained a lawyer for defense. Judge Cheng ordered the defendant to be detained and the trial adjourned for seven days for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Ordnance Factory Destroys Mortar Shells</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the Shanghai Ordnance Factory of the Ministry of War sent a tugboat with a barge loaded with over 1,600 mortar shells to the deep-water area outside the Sanjiaoshui estuary in Wusong to be discarded and destroyed. They returned to Shanghai after the task was completed after 3:00 PM. According to factory technician Mr. Li, these shells were outdated and the internal explosives had deteriorated, making them useless and potentially dangerous if stored in the factory. Although a large sum of money was spent on manufacturing them, they were being disposed of to avoid danger and ensure safety. When asked if there would be any danger if ships touched them when entering and leaving the harbor, he replied that they were sunk to the bottom of the deep sea with heavy objects, so there should be no other dangers.</p>
<h3>Young Woman Dies Tragically in Icy Pool, Body Unclaimed</h3>
<p>Coffin Temporarily Placed in Cemetery</p>
<p>It was previously reported that a young woman tragically died in an icy pool next to the Longwang Temple in Dachang Town. The chief of the first branch of the Baoshan County Public Security Bureau in the town, Mou Yizhi, reported to the county government to send personnel to investigate. It is now known that the county government sent the examiner Huang Jie with a clerk and investigators, accompanied by the chief of the first branch of the County Public Security Bureau, Wang Jinzhang, to investigate at around 5:00 PM the day before. Li Pinghua, the local guard of the 37th district of the town, moved the body to the shore. The examiner found no injuries on the body and determined that the death was caused by drowning. He filled out the death certificate and ordered the family of the deceased to prepare a coffin for burial. However, the Lu family claimed that the deceased's siblings did not recognize her as their sister and accused her of being a prostitute, so no one claimed the body at the time. The examiner Huang had no choice but to seal two strips of paper from the Lu family and order the local guard to prepare a coffin, carry the body to the cemetery, and temporarily place it there.</p>
<h3>Foreigners Entering China Must Present Passports</h3>

<h3>Hu Zhaoxi Dies Because of His Wife</h3>
<p>Younger Cousin Should Bear Major Responsibility</p>
<p>Hu Zhaoxi, a native of Xiaoshan who lived at No. 1 Yuyang Lane, Dongpushi Road, in the French Concession, and previously worked as a compradore for the Japanese-owned Yamamoto Yoko, remarried to Cheng Suizhu, a woman from Suzhou, in the summer of the 19th year because his wife had passed away and there was no one to manage the household. Initially, they lived harmoniously, but as an old man and a young woman, their feelings were not compatible. The young woman was also easily influenced by malicious words, leading to frequent conflicts. Hu's younger cousin, Tiao Yi, claiming to be a public-spirited person, kept his wife from leaving and even demanded a large sum of money. They once reached an agreement that the woman would take away all her clothes, jewelry, and chests, and also demanded 2,000 yuan in alimony from Hu. Hu did not want to pay, so he sought help from someone powerful to overturn the agreement. His cousin, afraid of the power of that person, relented. However, his desire to take advantage of Hu never diminished. Recently, they agreed to a divorce for 1,500 yuan. After the agreement, Hu felt that marital quarrels were normal, and his cousin should not have kept his wife from leaving and even demanded a large sum of money, which caused discord between relatives. He became angry and resentful and intentionally took his own life by taking poison the night before (the 30th). When his family discovered it, they rushed to call Dr. Niu Huilin for treatment, but he died that night. The body is now placed in the Wanguo Funeral Home, awaiting a family meeting to determine the funeral arrangements. It is said that after Zhaoxi died that night, his family reported it to the French police, but his cousin secretly asked for an exemption from inspection, which made his relatives very dissatisfied.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Province: Organization of County Education Associations Temporarily Suspended</h3>
<p>Zhenjiang Dispatch: The Jiangsu Education Department issued an order to the education bureaus of 34 counties, including Shanghai, Yixing, Wujiang, Guanyun, Wuxian, Piaoyang, Haimen, Jiangning, Chongming, Wujin, Suqian, Nantong, Qingpu, Dongtai, Jiading, Yangzhou, Nanhui, Gaochun, Jurong, Wuxi, Songjiang, Peixian, Zhenjiang, Fengxian, Huaiyin, Chuansha, Siyang, Donghai, Huaian, Qidong, Kunshan, Suining, Danyang, and Fengxian, that the organization of county education associations must be in accordance with the Education Association Law. The order is as follows: "The Ministry of Education's telegram states (omitted above). The Education Association Law has been drafted by the Legislative Yuan and submitted to the National Government for promulgation. The education associations in various counties and cities in the province that are in the process of organization should wait for the promulgation of the Education Association Law before proceeding in accordance with the law.

<h3>Jiangsu Education Department's Handling Method for the Teacher Strike at Jiangdu Elementary School</h3>
<p>During the two-week teacher strike at Jiangdu Elementary School, representatives of the elementary school teachers and staff came to the department to state two points: 1. Please order the collection of back pay. 2. Maintain the salary standard of the 18th year. The Jiangdu Bureau Chief Chen also came to the department to report on the situation of collecting funds and paying salaries. The Education Department believes that the arrears of salaries should of course be raised by the county government and paid in the shortest possible time with three months of funds. However, maintaining the salary standard of the 18th year would clearly destroy the new budget prepared for the 19th year and cannot be recognized. The county government has been strictly ordered to comply and the elementary school teachers have been urged to resume classes immediately.</p>

<h3>Conversation between Committee Members Cai and Shao and Students Studying in Japan</h3>
<p>Student representatives studying in Japan, including Lu Fubao, He You, and Cui Feng, have petitioned for their return to China after the suspension of the Boxer Indemnity, as reported in previous newspapers. It is now reported that the representatives met with Central Committee members Cai Yuanpei and Shao Lizi on the 27th and 28th. The main points of the conversation are as follows:</p>
<p>Committee Member Cai stated that since the difficulties faced by students studying in Japan are real, it is necessary to find ways to help them. Before the resolution of diplomatic issues, students studying in Japan should respect their own character and not accept selection fees from the Japanese. After the resolution of diplomatic issues, a portion of the Boxer Indemnity should still be used to subsidize students studying in Japan. Other countries have precedents for returning the Boxer Indemnity, so there should be no problem.</p>
<p>Committee Member Shao stated that the difficulties faced by students studying in Japan are so urgent that they should be resolved as soon as possible. The longer the Japanese Cultural Affairs Department exists, the greater the loss to China's Boxer Indemnity. It is reported that the representatives plan to meet with Chairman Jiang and Committee Members Hu, Wu, Yu, Dai, and Chen within days to present everything in person.</p>

<h3>Final Inter-Port Football Trial Match: Hypothetical Representative Team Wins</h3>
<p>Five to Zero</p>
<p>United Team Goalkeeper Defends in a Suit</p>
<p>One Goal After Another, the Whole Field Roars</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Westerners' Football Association held the final inter-port football trial match at the Yiyuan Football Field to determine the selection of the representative team for the inter-port games. Because the Westerners' Association announced yesterday that the match would be held regardless of the weather, the crowd was very large. The match started at 3:00 PM, and the result was a 5-0 victory for the hypothetical representative team over the Shanghai United team. The referee was Li Silian.</p>
<p>The United Team Faced the Challenge with Ten Players, and There Were Minor Changes to the Lineup Compared to the Announced Players. The Two Teams' Formations Were Mutually Adjusted. At 3:15 PM, There Were Still Only Twenty-One Players on the Field. The Hypothetical Representative Team Played the United Team's Ten Players with Eleven Players. In the Second Half, Wilson Joined the United Team as Goalkeeper, and the Original Goalkeeper, Manhush, Was Moved to Right Wing. The Two Teams' Lineups Are Listed Below:</p>
<p>Hypothetical Representative Team:</p>
<p>Zhou Xianyan, Martin, Monroe, Baodeheng, Gazu, Gushitai, Aili'ao, Kelasha, Sinclair, Weitma, Gedi Shi</p>
<p>Shanghai United Team:</p>
<p>Wilson, Faping, Marseille, Helei, Situke, Tuile, Miller, Mofei, Bolait, Ke'erqiao, Manhush</p>
<h3>Kelasha Scores the First Goal</h3>
<p>As soon as the two teams started the match, the United Team, with only ten players, had only four forwards attacking. Fortunately, Marseille was transferred to inside defense and cooperated with Faping to defend effectively. The representative team launched a fierce attack, with all three armies advancing directly to the goal. Kelasha, from the inside defense line about twenty yards away from the goal, launched a quick and extraordinary shot, breaking through the opponent's goal. The victory was decided within two minutes amidst the cheers of the crowd, who applauded the first goal. The United Team then defended strongly, and although the representative team attacked repeatedly, the score remained 1-0 until the end of the first half.</p>
<h3>Wilson Keeps Goal in a Suit</h3>
<p>After a brief rest, the teams switched sides and resumed the match. A few minutes later, the United Team moved goalkeeper Manhush to the forward line as right wing, hoping to add fresh strength to the attack. Wilson, dressed in a neat suit and appearing like a refined gentleman, took over as goalkeeper. The field was very wet, and the ball was often covered in mud. If he tried to catch the ball in his suit, it would get dirty. Therefore, after Weitma scored one goal, Gazu followed up with another, and then Weitma scored again, making it 4-0. Loud applause erupted. Unfortunately, in the last five minutes, Aili'ao broke free and attacked directly. The ball grazed the crossbar and went in, resulting in a final score of 5-0.</p>
<p>Representative Team to Be Decided Today</p>
<p>According to the Westerners' Association, the representative team yesterday was only hypothetical. The official list of players going to Hong Kong will be decided today.</p>

<h3>Western Youth Women's Basketball Association: Western Youth Wins Over Dongguang</h3>
<p>Result: 40-8</p>
<p>|Peicheng Has Withdrawn|</p>
<p>The Western Youth Women's Basketball Association originally had two matches scheduled yesterday: one between Western Youth Red Team and Dongguang, and one between Maiquan and Peicheng. However, Peicheng withdrew halfway through, and all subsequent matches were cancelled. Therefore, only one match between Dongguang and Western Youth was held yesterday. The difference in strength between the two teams was significant. Although Dongguang tried its best to resist, it was no match for Western Youth. In the end, Western Youth won 40-8. The referee was Shao Ji.</p>

<h3>Philippines Proposes Cancellation of Volleyball Championship</h3>
<p>China and Japan Unanimously Oppose</p>
<p>Next Meeting to Proceed as Usual</p>
<p>The Philippine Sports Association recently proposed the cancellation of the volleyball championship at the next Far Eastern Games because the Olympic Games do not have this event. Japan was the first to oppose this. The Chinese National Amateur Athletic Federation believes that this competition has been held for a long time and that the people of the three countries have a deep interest in it, so it also expressed its disagreement with the Philippine proposal. With the unanimous opposition of China and Japan, the proposal cannot exist, and the next meeting will proceed as usual.</p>
<h3>Former Honorary Director of the Federation, Shen Siliang, Resumes His Duties Today</h3>
<p>Director-General Hao Boyang Resigns</p>
<p>Shen Siliang, the former honorary director of the Chinese National Amateur Athletic Federation, was highly regarded for his management of the federation's affairs. He went to the United States to relinquish his duties a few years ago. Last year, after returning to China, the board of directors of the federation firmly requested Mr. Shen to resume his post, but he was unable to do so due to various reasons. Currently, the director-general of the federation, Hao Boyang, has completed all the procedures for the previous Far Eastern Games and has fulfilled his long-cherished wish to retire cleanly. Yesterday, he bid farewell to the directors of the federation. The board of directors reluctantly granted his request. However, the board believes that the progress of the federation's affairs is related to the future of the entire country, and only someone with both qualifications and knowledge can lead the way and develop it. After considering the entire country, the board believes that Mr. Shen is the most suitable person. The board reiterated its previous request, and Mr. Shen, unable to avoid it, agreed to take time to attend the federation and oversee the overall direction. It is scheduled for him to resume his duties today, and they plan to hire another secretary to handle various matters with Mr. Zhou Jiaqi.</p>
<h3>Jinan Football and Basketball Teams' Campaign in the Philippines (5)</h3>
<p>(Report from Manila by Our Correspondent Wenchu, January 26)</p>
<p>(1) Football Victory Over the United Team</p>
<p>|Fourth Match|</p>
<p>A Score of Three to One</p>
<p>Yesterday (January 24) was a day of basketball defeat, and the crowd felt unhappy. Fortunately, today (January 25, 4:30 PM), the football team defeated the combined team of British, Spanish, American, and Filipino players with a score of 3-1, so the football championship already belongs to us (there are a total of five matches, one draw and three big wins). It also washed away the ridicule and jeers from foreigners last night after the crushing defeat.</p>
<h3>National Strength Affects Sports</h3>
<p>Before our match, there was also a match between the British Navy football team and the San Beda University team in the field, also a battle, but because the audience did not pay attention, they felt unappreciated, so there was no applause. The result was a 2-1 victory for the British Navy. There is one thing to ponder in this. That is, the British are arrogant and boast that they are a first-class nation, and football is their birthplace, no different from a family meal, with an attitude of looking down on everyone else, and everyone is strong, which makes them even more daunting. The Filipinos regard themselves as a small and weak people, so they are unusually cautious and dare not take any transgressing actions. They only bravely resist and do not see any fierce counterattacks. This situation of national strength also affects the sports field, and the audience has the same unpleasant feeling.</p>
<h3>Chen Zhenhe Deserves the First Credit</h3>
<p>When the time came, our side lined up against the enemy, and the terrain was inferior. After the two armies fought, the enemy came fiercely and tried their best to attack. One or two dangerous balls were saved by our two defenders. As a result, the five tigers of the forward launched their divine power and directly attacked the enemy territory. General Chen Zhenhe, with a divine kick, aimed at the enemy's goal and scored, recording his first merit amidst the cheers of the crowd.</p>
<h3>Center Dai Breaks the Enemy Again</h3>
<p>After our side scored a goal, our momentum became even stronger. Defenders General Ma Er and Jiang Shanjing coordinated well, not allowing the enemy to stay in our territory. Forward center Dai came out to meet the enemy and fought bravely to score another goal. The distance between the scores started only ten minutes into the battle.</p>
<p>The Enemy Also Fought Bravely and Pursued Directly, Attacking Repeatedly, But As Soon As the Ball Entered Our Territory, It Was Picked Off, And Our Army's Five Forward Tigers Repeatedly Demonstrated Outside the Enemy Territory, Attacking Several Times in a Row. In the End, the Enemy Defended Effectively, So the Score Remained 2-0 in the First Half.</p>
<h3>Fortunately, the Enemy Did Not Get Shut Out</h3>
<p>At the Beginning of the Second Half, Our Army Launched More Intense Attacks Several Times. Once, Center Dai Received a Pass from the Left Wing and Advanced Alongside General Hei. The Enemy's Rescue Arrived. At This Point, Center Dai Used His Soft Skills to Lightly Pick the Ball to the Right, And General Luo Jia Was Injured as a Result. Fortunately, He Was Able to Act Normally Upon Returning to His Residence.</p>
<p>The Competition in the Second Half Was Even More Intense. The Enemy Desperately Wanted to Break the Shutout Record, So They Did Not Hold Back. In the End, They Managed to Kick in a Goal, Making the Score 3-0. Our Side Then Declared a Great Victory.</p>
<p>Jinan Lineup</p>
<p>Xie Quanhe, Jiang Zhujing, Feng Yunyou, Chen Jiaqiu, Sen Songfa, Liang Shutang, Yang Hongbao, Chen Zhenhe, Lin Jie, Yang Baomiao (Below), Luo Haiguang (Above), Fu Hexuan</p>
<h3>(2) Basketball Defeated by Santo Tomas</h3>
<p>|Fourth Match|</p>
<p>Twenty-Two to Fifty-Nine</p>
<p>At 7:00 AM on January 24, Our Country's Zhenru Basketball Team Competed Against the Basketball Team of Santo Tomas STC. Tamas University. This Was Their Fourth Operation in the Philippine Expedition. The Result Was a Miserable Defeat of 22-59. On a Long Expedition with an Isolated Army, Victory and Defeat Are Common. However, There Are Many Notable Preparations for Domestic Athletes to Reference.</p>
<h3>Santo Tomas Basketball History</h3>
<p>The History of Santo Tomas University Was Detailed in the Previous Correspondence. Its Basketball Team Has Also Been Training for a Long Time. In the Past Two Years, It Has Competed in 42 Matches Against All University and Community Basketball Teams on the Philippine Islands, And All Have Been Victorious and Unbeatable. Therefore, It Has Recently Been Called the Steel Army of the Basketball World. More Than a Month Ago, Foreign Reports Announced That the University Authorities Believed That the Athletes Were Too Enthusiastic About Basketball, And Their Usual Studies Were Seriously Neglected, With More Than Half Failing to Advance to the Next Grade. There Was a Resolution to Temporarily Suspend Not Joining Any External Sports. Later, Because Our Country's Jinan University Football and Zhenru Basketball Teams Were Planning to Compete in the Philippines and Win Honor for the International Community, The Previous Resolution Was Cancelled (After This Competition, It Was Decided to Suspend It). In Addition, The Jinan University Was Subdued Four to One in Yesterday's Football Championship, So It Was Even More Determined to Seek Revenge and Restore Its Years-Long Reign as a Basketball Overlord. Among Its Players, Jacinto and Del Io3ario and T. Vlianucva Are Representatives of the Far Eastern Games Basketball Team, While Center Montinola and Striker Silva Are Brave Generals Who Have Won Hundred Battles. They Are All Confident and See No One Else in Their Eyes.</p>
<p>Zhenru Scores First</p>
<p>As Soon As the Referee's Whistle Blew, The Two Armies Immediately Displayed Their Formations. The Opponent's Left Guard Immediately Fouled, And Huang Zhaolin's Penalty Shot Missed. The Ball Was Passed Back and Forth Between the Two Armies. Suddenly, Our Left Forward Cai Rongrui Snapped Up the Enemy's Ball and Passed It Quickly to Right Guard Kong Guangyi. Kong Immediately Took a Long Shot and Scored, And Our Side Opened a New Record of Two Points.</p>
<h3>The Opponent Has a Smooth Sailing</h3>
<p>Seeing That Our Side Had Opened a New Record, The Opponent Was Greatly Energized. The Left Forward Scored a Goal Near the Basket, Followed by a Penalty Goal, Thus Reversing the Score to 3-2. From Then On, Our Side Gradually Fell Behind, Gradually Reaching a Score of Twelve to Two. Yang Jiajiang (Linyu) Was Annoyed And Brought His Illness to the Battle, Allowing General Huang to Rest Briefly. Our Side's Morale Was Boosted, But The Opponent Immediately Responded with a Score, Increasing It to Twenty to Four. Before Long, The Scores of Both Sides Were in a Three to One Ratio, That Is, Twenty-Four to Eight. The Opponent Had a Great Advantage and Had a Smooth Sailing. The Left Forward Who Was Good at Using His Right Hand Long Shot Scored Another Goal. Although General Wei Wenchang Also Hit Twice Because of Two Penalty Shots, The Opponent Used Penalty Shots to Increase Another Point. Li Chengyuan, Who Was Originally Watching from the Sidelines with an Illness, Forcibly Joined the Battle Seeing Our Army's Failure. General Huang Received His Pass And Scored Another Two Points, But Li Was Still Unable to Endure Due to His Injury, So Wei Substituted Him Again. The First Half Resulted in the Opponent Winning 27-12.</p>
<h3>Our Counterattack Was Ineffective</h3>
<p>The Opponent's War Merit Rose Straight Up. The Scribe Under the Billboard Almost Wrote Non-Stop. Although Our Side Had Many Chances to Get the Ball in Hand, Close Shots Could Not Be Hit. When It Reached 41 to 16, General Huang Was Angered And His Tiger Eyes Went Horizontal. He Bravely Snapped Up the Ball And Passed It Quickly to Cai, Who Shot It in from the Left And Scored Another Two Points, And The Army's Morale Was Boosted Again. As a Last Struggle, The Opponent Was Very Lucky And Scored Another Goal And Then A Penalty, Until Our Side Only Got Twenty Points, And The Opponent Had Increased to 49. Although Our Army Had the Ambition to Break the Boat, The Opponent Had a Good Guess and Their Bodies Were Alive And Their Vision Was Accurate. They Achieved Success Every Time, So In the Last Two Minutes, They Launched One Attack After Another, Scoring Ugly Goals. Therefore, at the End of the Game, It Became 59 to 22, A Great Victory for the Zhenru Team.</p>
<p>Reasons for Zhenru's Failure</p>
<p>The First Time That Veteran General Huang Hansheng's Achievements Were Seen by Chinese and Foreigners Was Due to Weather Conditions. In the Past Day or Two, He Was Not Feeling Well, So He Was Slightly Older. The Opponent's Tactics Were Clever and Their Skills Were Nimble, Which Was Really Beyond Our Reach. This Was Recognized by the Audience. That Is, Their High Jump, Sprint, Pass, And Shot Were Also Full of Tricks, Which Made the Spectators Dazzled and the Warring Side Was Overwhelmed. This Was the Greatest Reason for Victory, And Our Side's Shot Were Inaccurate And Our Hands Were Flustered, So There Were Many Chances for Baskets And Long Shots Near Attacks Could Not Be Hit. Even Several Penalty Shots Could Not Be Baskets. Although Victory and Defeat Are Common, If We Can Explore People's Strengths to Make Up for Our Weaknesses, We Can Reverse the Defeat.</p>

<h3>A Laughing Matter 1 ·Hai·Ke</h3>
<p>A: Mr. C is an insensitive and unfeeling person. Everyone says his heart is as hard as iron.</p>
<p>B: I don't believe that. Didn't you see his eyes?</p>
<p>A: What about his eyes?</p>
<p>B: I saw one of his eyes was very soft. When he looked at people, it was watery, like a woman's.</p>
<p>A: That's a fake eye made of glass.</p>
<p>A: I heard you've been married for three years.</p>

<h3>Remembering Old Times at the Deer Terrace</h3>
<p>Sick Mandarin Ducks</p>
<p>The Mi Luo Treasure Pavilion was a renowned scenic spot within the Yuan Miao Taoist Temple in Suzhou. This magnificent three-story tower pierced the clouds. During the Taiping Rebellion, it was destroyed by fire. During the Tongzhi and Guangxu reigns, a businessman from Zhejiang, Wu Xueyan, funded its reconstruction, restoring its former glory. Unexpectedly, it was later consumed by another fire, reduced to a pile of rubble.</p>
<p>Tang, a poet, once wrote a verse about it: (Cool evening breeze within the Yuan Miao Temple, leisurely sipping tea and chatting about the thirty thousand Chang. The pavilion, after the calamity, is scorched earth, only the incense-offering old women speak of the past.) This was composed in memory of the pavilion. Now, the people of Suzhou intend to rebuild the Zhongshan Hall on its ruins, transforming the useless into something useful. (San Wan Chang is a famous old teahouse in Suzhou, established during the Tongzhi reign and still existing today.)</p>
<p>The former site of the palace of Zhang Shicheng, the King of Wu, is now a park, library, and public sports ground. During the Qing Dynasty, it was the garrison of a garrison commander named Chou. During his tenure, Commander Chou planted willow trees on both sides of the road outside the garrison gate. In spring and summer, the green shade was like a canopy, and the drooping branches brushed the ground, turning people's clothes and shoes green as they walked beneath them. In front of the drill hall was a vast open space with lush green grass like a carpet. The stablemen in the garrison often grazed horses there. At sunset, the sight of the horses, black or yellow, standing or lying down, rubbing against each other affectionately or kicking each other in anger, was a beautiful scene.</p>
<p>I once wrote a verse about it: (In the second month of the year at the base of the Wu King’s Ruins, slender willows droop green mist at the garrison gate. In times of peace, there is no war, and the swift steeds enjoy grazing on the grass.) This is also a factual record.</p>
<p>The enclosure was built by Qian Yuan, the Prince of Wuyue. Now, it is abandoned and used as farmland. The area from the west to Canglang Pavilion and the east to Fengmen City Root is all called Nan Yuan (South Garden). However, the exact location of the old garden is unknown. The farmers there all plant rapeseed flowers. Every year in February and March, the fields stretch as far as the eye can see, like gold. Young women often come in groups to enjoy the scenery.</p>
<p>I also once wrote a verse: (In the second month of the year, the South Garden is fragrant with rapeseed flowers. The ground is covered with gold, measured by the peck. After all, gold can still be bought, but the spring scenery is hard to buy with ten thousand gold.)</p>
<p>The West Lake in Hangzhou and Mochou Lake in Nanjing are both famous for producing lotus roots. However, neither can compare to the lotus roots of Nantang in Suzhou. Nantang is located more than ten li outside Fengmen City, commonly known as Da Tang Guo. The area also produces chicken beans, which are also quite famous. The flesh is white as pearls, soft and smooth. In the past, Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang Dynasty praised Consort Yang's breasts, saying that they were like soft and warm freshly peeled chicken beans. He used the words "soft and warm" to describe the chicken beans. Now, looking at the chicken beans of Nantang, I admire the ingenuity of his words even more.</p>
<p>I once wrote a verse: (Fengxi is originally a land of water and clouds. The seasonal delicacies of early autumn are tasted in turn. The chicken beans are round and even, the fresh lotus roots are emerald green. The cries to buy them fill Nantang Street.) I wonder how the gluttons would react upon seeing this, drooling with desire.</p>
<h3>Discussion on National Arts Identification by Wei Mo the Second</h3>
<p>My friend Jin Yiming from Yangzhou is a scholar and a martial arts expert. He has authored numerous books on boxing techniques, published by Zhonghua, Da Dong, Bai Xin, Zhong Xi, and other publishing houses. Appreciated by Mr. Niu Tiesheng, he was specially commissioned by the Jiangsu Provincial Guoshu (National Arts) Museum as a training instructor. His monthly salary would be used for living expenses, allowing him to focus on writing and promoting the martial arts.</p>
<p>Recently, Mr. Jin invented a national arts identification. He said that whenever martial artists perform or spar, they must clasp their fists and say "Please." However, this gesture has many variations depending on the school. Outsiders may not notice, but experts can immediately tell the difference.</p>
<p>Jin believes that with the current popularity of national arts, with both official Guoshu museums and private societies flourishing, there must be an identification for authentic national arts. What is this identification? The left hand is clenched into a fist, and the middle three fingers of the right hand are placed on top of the left fist. This allows people to immediately recognize that it is the orthodox boxing technique of the Republic of China and contains the meaning of the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution.</p>
<p>Now, Mr. Jin has submitted a detailed report to Zhang Zhijiang, the director of the Central Guoshu Museum, requesting that all national arts organizations, both public and private, throughout the country be ordered to adopt this Three Principles of the People and Five-Power Constitution national arts identification. However, it is still unknown whether this will be approved. However, some say that Jin's invention is indeed interesting and has a proper purpose. It is believed that it will be adopted and commended after it is presented.</p>
<h3>A Record of the Long-Distance Exhibition of the China Art College</h3>
<p>Qi Qi Lu</p>
<p>The China Art College has been established for two years.</p>
<p>The professors it has hired are all famous literary and artistic figures in Shanghai. With proper guidance and practical management, the results have been remarkable. At the beginning of the year, the Second Achievement Exhibition was held at the Ningbo Association and its reputation spread far and wide, hailed as a sight to behold. The 700 exhibits can be divided into three parts: works by famous artists outside the school, works by the school's professors, and works by students.</p>
<p>Famous artists such as Ma Xiangbo, Cai Zimin, Zhou Mengpo, Zhu Qiangcun, Zheng Xisou, Wang Yiting, Shang Shengbo, Wu Daiqiu, Jiang Tianduo, Zhang Xiaolou, Qian Mingshan, Zheng Sukan, Yu Youren, Yan Ganyuan, Chen Taoyi, Dong Shoujing, Chen Rongmin, Zhang Taiyan, Ye Weixin, Qian Shoutie, Wang Fuan, Qin Qingzeng, Ma Qizhou, Yu Yueyuan, and other gentlemen contributed a total of 300 works of calligraphy and painting, all extremely valuable and difficult to collect.</p>
<p>The works of the professors were both exquisite and numerous. For example, Zhang Daqian contributed 20 large landscape paintings, ten of which were landscapes with mist and clouds, and beards and hair were skillfully depicted. These were normally impossible to obtain even with large sums of money. Qi Baishi contributed ten paintings of figures, tigers, and landscapes, all without equal. He contributed twelve paintings of lions, with clear and elegant brushwork that transcended appearance. He also contributed fifteen paintings of red azaleas, as well as a handscroll of a hundred flowers worth three thousand gold, which he donated to the school. Xin Hu contributed fifteen pieces, Meng Rong fifteen pieces, and Pan Tianshou forty pieces, all of which were carefully crafted and a magnificent sight to behold, like entering a treasure mountain.</p>
<p>Among the students' works, those by Shen Limin, You Qi Kan, and Dai Hetian were particularly outstanding in landscapes. Wang Fuding, Fang Jiangshui, Huang Jinghua, Zhang Youfen, and Wu Yuanzhen excelled in flower paintings. Qu Zongxie's meticulous brushwork of animals was the best. All of these students inherited the teachings of masters such as Hong Wei, Meng Rong, Pan Tianshou, Gong Zhan, Qi Baishi, and Huang Binhong, so they were able to make rapid progress. The assistant teachers Du Xiaofu, Chen Yishi, Zhou Shengan, and Qi Weixin each had unique styles, demonstrating the outstanding achievements of the school's previous graduates.</p>
<p>It is now reported that the colleagues at the school are planning a long-distance exhibition along the Beijing-Shanghai line, from Wuxi, Changzhou, Suzhou, and Yangzhou to the capital, to enlighten the aesthetic concepts of the people in the interior and seek evaluations from all walks of life. With enthusiastic sales of tickets, its reputation will surely spread far and wide, becoming a unique highlight in the artistic and educational circles of Southern China. (Que Chou)</p>
<h3>Xuzhou Will Have a Charity Performance to Raise Relief Funds</h3>
<p>Xiao Ting</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Xuzhou Red Swastika Society has been very enthusiastic about providing medicine and relief. In addition, the city has been plagued by frequent wars in recent years, with a large number of refugees gathering there. Therefore, the relief work is even more arduous than in other places. Last year, during the campaign against Feng Yuxiang, the members bravely rescued the wounded soldiers and achieved remarkable results. Chairman Jiang deeply appreciated this and donated 5,000 yuan to promote winter relief. The people in charge of the society are all local celebrities. Seeing that the weather is cold and the year is ending, the number of victims waiting for relief is countless. Therefore, they established a large-scale porridge factory at the four gates. After its implementation, the order was well maintained. However, there was not enough porridge for everyone, and refugees from all directions came to hear the news. They were constantly waiting to be fed, making it difficult to refuse them. Therefore, they united with local talents from all walks of life to discuss holding a charity performance to raise large sums of money for relief, so that the merits could be fulfilled and there would be no regrets.</p>
<p>After the decision was made, Mr. Li Baochen was publicly recommended to come to Shanghai to discuss the matter of inviting performers with Mr. Su Shaoxiang and myself. With the strong support of Mr. Gao Shikui, a famous figure in Shanghai, Mr. Gu Zhuxuan of the Tianchan Stage agreed to lend the stage, and Liu Kuiguan's troupe was invited to perform in Xuzhou for five days. Kuiguan had been in Xuzhou for a long time in the past, and his performances were very popular. The relationship between the two sides was very close, making it easy to create a sensation. In addition, Yang Baosen, a famous Laosheng (old male role) performer, was tired of traveling and wanted to return home. Now, taking advantage of his passing through Xuzhou, I and others invited him to perform. Mr. Yang and Mr. Liu, who are both benevolent and good friends, generously agreed to perform difficult and popular plays. It is planned that Baosen will perform "Dingjun Mountain", "Yangping Pass", "Heavenly Thunder", "Report to the Southern Heaven Gate", "Scolding Cao", "Celebrating the Birthday", "Capturing and Releasing Cao", and "Fenhe Bay". Kuiguan will perform "Jiujiang Kou", "Taking Gao Deng", "Tongtian Rhinoceros", "Ancient City Meeting", "Flooding the Seven Armies", "Running the City", "Walking the Wheat Field", and "Battle of Xiaoting". It is predicted that after the performance begins on February 3rd, the results will be satisfactory. If so, then the benefits to the victims will be significant.</p>
<h3>Parisian Tales (2) (0)</h3>
<p>Six Meeting in Paris</p>
<p>After talking so much, I have only described the exterior of Notre Dame Cathedral in a very general way. Now, let me talk about the value of Notre Dame Cathedral in the history of art. Didn't I say above that Notre Dame Cathedral was built in 1163? But such a large Notre Dame Cathedral was not built all at once. It was started in 1163, but the entire construction was completed in the middle of the 14th century.</p>
<p>When the construction of Notre Dame Cathedral began, it was precisely the time when the traditional Romanesque architecture was gradually declining and the new and unique Gothic style (Style gothique) architecture was rising to replace it. Notre Dame Cathedral was built part by part in this era, with continuous work being done. Therefore, the traces of Gothic development are preserved in this building. Thus, Notre Dame Cathedral is not only the best model for studying Gothic architecture today, but it can also be seen as a history of the development of French architecture from the 12th to the 14th centuries.</p>
<p>Now, when you go to visit Notre Dame Cathedral and approach the front, the first thing that catches your eye is the rich decoration on the building. The corners of the walls are embedded with exquisite carvings. In the center of Notre Dame Cathedral, there are three large arched doors. I don't know how many statues there are around each door. Most of those statues represent religious stories. Above the three doors is a Galerie des roiso, which lists the statues of twenty-eight kings of ancient Judah and Israel. Above that is a long railing, also adorned with carvings. In the middle are the Virgin Mary and two angels, Adam on the right, and Eve on the left. Everyone knows that these two naked men and women are the ancestors of mankind who were expelled from paradise. Behind the railing is a very large and exquisitely carved miniature stained glass window. This stained glass window is called Roseo. This is indispensable in every Catholic church. Going up again is a colonnade connecting the two square towers. From below, it looks very fragile and dangerous, but in fact, this colonnade is very solid and people can walk back and forth on it.</p>
<h3>Warmth in the Heart (361)</h3>
<p>Tian Xiao</p>
<p>Chapter 17: The Magic of Staying Young; Green-Black Eyebrows Confused; No Way to Extend Life; Gold Market and Swift Horses</p>
<p>Ever since Ren Peizhen left, everyone thought she was a topic for discussion. Some said she was strangely shaped and simply didn't look like a woman. Some said she was earnestly trying to expand women's rights... Unfortunately, women's education was underdeveloped and women's knowledge was still too lacking. After another half hour, Long Ziyun and others also left. Zuo Shichen originally wanted to go with them, but because Luyi had said that she hadn't been to class for several days, not only had she not learned new books, but she was afraid that she had forgotten the old ones, so she was preparing to teach a few new lessons and review the old ones. Therefore, she was still late. Just as she was teaching, Luyi's mother slowly came out with a water pipe in her hand. She said to Luyi, "My daughter, do you know that Hua Yuanchun, Hua Lao Liu, is dead?" Luyi was still teaching her class and didn't pay much attention to that sentence, because she didn't really know Hua Yuanchun very well. Although she had met her once or twice, it was just a casual acquaintance and they didn't greet each other. Zuo Shichen knew this person, so he asked, "Isn't Hua Yuanchun in Beijing?" Luyi's mother said, "Isn't she dead in Beijing? Her business was also very good in Shanghai. Unfortunately, this Miss Liu was really too reckless. She didn't treat her business like a business, and she didn't treat money like money. The workers carried foreign money, thinking of making a profit, but her debts kept adding up, more and more. She didn't care at all and continued to be reckless. But the debts she owed had to be repaid in the end. Forced to the point of no return, she had to leave the pier." Zuo Shixuan said, "I know Hua Lao Liu's business was not bad in Shanghai. She had a lot of guests, her rooms were well cleaned, and she had a little bit of a career. Why was she forced to leave the pier?" Luyi's mother said, "Second Young Master, you really don't know that those reckless young ladies are more likely to squander money when their business is good. They spend the money they earn as if it were being poured away and never care about the days to come. They don't repay any of the money they owe. You think the interest on the loans in the brothel is several times higher. Three or four cents isn't surprising. Three thousand foreign dollars will turn into four thousand in the blink of an eye. Those young ladies spend money as they please, as long as they are in the limelight. Once their clothes are made, they only wear them three or four times and then say they are not fashionable and want new ones. They change their shoes twice a day, which is a bit of a waste of things. They just carelessly created that big hole. Second Young Master, you say her business was still good. At first, it was indeed not bad. There were some adults and old masters who liked her very much. Later, the reputation of the reckless party spread. The scandalous reputation of having affairs with actors and grooms spread, so why would people bother to come and serve you? So Hua Lao Liu later got to the point where she couldn't make it anymore before she finally left."</p>
<h3>Watching the Moon with the Abbot of Jinshan on the First Night of the Month</h3>
<p>Watching the Moon Mao Heting</p>
<p>The Yangtze River is like a dragon, its waves like scales. Each scale is a pearl, full of light. Suddenly, the river surface extends a corner, transforming this solitary pagoda into thousands of layers of clouds. I have stayed at Jinshan many times. Briefly speaking, I have been with Master Fu (Yuanshu) and Chen (Shanyu) before. The old people are still there, but only the Master is still alive (Meicun Rongtong both retired, but both transformed). Meeting again, we are older and more enthusiastic. The previous dynasty left me, bitterly unwilling to stay. I cherish the words of parting. I met an old friend in Moling (referring to Zhan Tang). Who knew that he would turn north and return. Going and staying are not up to me. Thinking carefully, what is not a past cause? How can there be no moon on the Qinhuai River tonight? Why abandon it and go here? The master says that the moon there is the same as the moon here. Look at the swirling patterns on your fingers. Please write a poem to pay off the long-standing debt. There is definitely a dragon in the heart of the river that knows and hears.</p>
<h3>The next day I stayed overnight in Jiaoshan with Yiru and his wife, with no moon all night</h3>
<p>Yesterday I drunkenly stepped on the ridge of Jinshan Mountain, clapping my hands at the long Yangtze River, the river moon white. I slightly disliked that it was only nine points round, leaving this one point for tonight. Shao Jun is also not a person who seeks anything. The room is quiet and the pampered spring is good. Taking the time out of his busy schedule to fulfill a promise, he said that if he didn't come, he would be ashamed of the river god. Under the Jiang Pavilion, the river flows, competing with the moon as a bright lamp, with the river as a mirror. Jiaoshan has always been compared to a beauty. It should be even more beautiful in the moonlight in the frost. The Ti Garden also came from Yangzhou, and Jin Jun urged me to write a poem to the moon. What is the purpose of our obsession? From morning to evening, we wander thousands of times. Suddenly, heavy rain hits the window. Looking around, the clouds block the view. I know I have missed it and want to come again next year. I still think I can spit it out at the fourth watch. The old monk broke the rule and came out to socialize, and the Taoist priest drowsily hung his head. Yesterday's moon and today are both given by heaven. How can they all be up to you? Let's listen to the sound of the bell eight hundred times.</p>

<h3>Finance - Spot Gold Continues to Appear Lively</h3>
<p>Turbulent and fluctuating, yesterday, January 31st, the gold price rose sharply, but the fluctuations were still large, sometimes hovering around three or four taels, causing people to feel uneasy. As overseas silver prices continued to fall, gold prices rose sharply. Buyers were hesitant, but large firms such as Xin Heng Yuan, Sheng Fu Yu, Heng Xing, etc., were actively buying, while sellers included Yuan Heng, Hong Li, Yi Feng Yong, and the Dalian Gang. The exchange rate remained tight, but the premium was slightly reduced, and the listed price was reduced by half. In the morning, the gold price once exceeded 720 taels. Afterwards, sellers increased, causing the price to fall slightly to 714 taels. Then the situation diverged. At noon, the exchange rate improved, and there were reports of India increasing taxes. This aroused people's enthusiasm, and there were still many buyers, presenting a sharp upward trend. Finally, the spot price was close to 720 taels, about 4 taels and 7 maces and 5 lis higher. The large bars still had to fall this morning. In the afternoon, the market was closed as usual on Saturdays.</p>
<p>The market opened high. In the morning, the March opening rose by 3 taels and 5 maces to 717 taels and 5 maces. The large bars were down another quarter. The forward silver price fell by one-eighth, but the United States still had sales, and private telegrams also showed a small decrease of one-half. The market was flat. Therefore, the market opened high, and then increased by 5 maces. Xin Heng Yuan, Cheng, and others all entered the market, but there were still many sellers. Zhen Chang Xiang, Yuan Heng, Yuan Mao, Yong Cui Tai, and others all sold off. Suddenly, the market fell back to 15 taels and a half. Suddenly, it saw an upward trend again. It was actually because Xin Heng, Fu Yu, and Yuan Cheng were chasing after Luo's order, and the exchange rate had revealed a tight market. Banks were mutually doing near-term British gold at 133.75, which was bought by HSBC. Then Zheng Jin and others came out with the May price, which was the same, and it was predicted that Xian Ling and others would have to shrink, so the price rose by more than 5 taels, reaching 721 taels at 9:30 when Xian Ling opened.</p>
<p>A declining trend was discovered. The listed price was indeed reduced by 1.25 US dollars, and the gold price did not rise further. The market was flat in the 20 taels range. Banks were mutually doing June at 134.375. McGalli also sold at the same price for the April period. Fu Chang, Yi Feng Yong, and others sold in the market, so the price had dropped to 16 taels and a half. At about 10 o'clock, Yuan Heng, Heng Xing, Yuan Hong, Li Shun Li, Yi Xing, and others all sold, and Anda also sold British gold for 13.5.1 at one o'clock, causing the market to slump and depreciate by 4 taels at 10:10, suddenly falling to 14 taels.</p>
<p>After the close, the market continued to rise. Heng Xing, Hong Xing, Fu Yu, and others all came to buy. British gold rebounded. Mitsui absorbed February at 134.375, and the gold price jumped by more than 5 taels, reaching 19 taels and 5 maces at more than 10:50. After 3:15, the market seemed to be stable in the 2 and a half taels range. After 11:30, Yuan Mao, Yong Hong, Li Wu Pin, and others sold a lot, and in just over ten minutes, the price plunged by more than 5 taels, falling to 14 taels at more than 11:40. Shortly after, the buying party seemed to see cumbersome hedging clauses and did not enter the market, and the exchange rate was flat. Hua banks were mutually doing April British gold at 43.75, which suddenly tightened, and the gold price increased by 2 taels, totaling 17 taels, 1 mace, and 2 qian. At noon, the closing price was 716 taels and 7 maces, which was an increase of 2 taels and 7 maces compared to yesterday. It soared again by 2 or 3 taels, reaching almost 20 taels. Fu Yu, Chang Sheng Yong, and others all entered the market, and news came that India would increase import taxes, causing people to be enthusiastic and prevent the large bars from falling without increasing. The maximum price in the morning was 22 taels, and the minimum price was 14 taels, a difference of 7 taels. Wu Pin's early market was 17 taels and a half, and the afternoon closing was 18 taels. The listed price has been changed to 772 taels, suppressing 52 or 3 taels to 58 taels. At noon, 55 taels were recorded. February was 12 taels, March was 17 taels, and the water supplement was 12 taels.</p>
<p>There was a high demand. The market was oversupplied. The speculators Luo's No. 2 supplemented the market. Xin Heng, Fu Yu, Yuan Cheng, Yong Heng, Zhi Feng Yong, Heng Xing, Sen Chang Yong, and Da De Cheng all entered the market. Yi Xing, Hong Li, Shun Li, Yuan Xiang Tai, Tai Run, Yuan Tai, Zhen Chang Xiang, Yi Feng Yong, and Fu Chang all sold. Finally, Chang Sheng Yong and Fu Chang re-entered the market. Yuan Mao Yong Wu Pin sold a large amount. The Dalian Gang sold 1,200 to 1,300 bars, stopping at 300 to 400 bars. The Guangdong Gang also pulled in hundreds of bars.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange - Both the Official and Unofficial Markets Were Tight</h3>
<p>Chinese Merchants Concluded 200,000 Pounds of British Gold Transactions... Japanese Gold Transactions Were Scattered</p>
<p>Yesterday, the British, American, and Indian silver markets all reported declines. The United States was still selling, so the market trend was weak. The British-American exchange rate rose slightly, and the British-Japanese exchange rate, which had not moved for many days, suddenly fell. The Yokohama and Kobe markets had no good or bad records. As a result, the Shanghai HSBC listed prices for various currencies were reduced by half a grade. British gold was reduced by 125, currently at 1 shilling and 3 pence, 25 US dollars, 25 at 30 yuan, 0875 Indian exchange rate, 75 at 85 rupees. The French franc was reduced by 6 yuan, currently at 887 yuan. The German exchange rate was reduced by 1 yuan, currently at 129 marks, 75 and the ocean was reduced by half a yuan, currently at 76 shields, 75. Singapore was increased by 1 tael and 7 qian and 5 fen, currently at 182 taels. Hong Kong remained unchanged at 77 taels. Japanese gold was increased by 1 cent and 25 fen, currently at 1 tael, 6 qian, 025. The British gold internal market was initially firm, but then seemed to loosen. The gold market also saw a setback. At noon, the situation suddenly turned sharp and strong. As a result, various currencies also became tight. It was reported that India was planning to impose an import tax, so the silver market was afraid of the stimulation of the reappearance of pressure. Compared with the previous day, the British gold market shrunk by 125, the US exchange rate shrunk by 25, and the Japanese gold market rose by 75. Chinese merchants in the gold industry slightly bought in, totaling 200,000 pounds of British gold. Banks such as Hua Bi, Zheng Jin, Anda, and Mai Xing all sold, but Mitsui slightly bought in. Various banks also mutually concluded transactions, with HSBC buying in the first contract. For US dollars, Mitsui slightly shipped in and out. Mobil Oil Company still concluded accounts. As for Japanese gold transactions, they were scattered. In the afternoon, there was a lack of market due to Saturday.</p>
<p>British Exchange - The internal market was estimated to have a rise and fall of 0625. The asking price for January and February in the morning was 1 shilling and 3 pence, 375, the buying price for March and April was 4375, plus 0625. China-France and HSBC did a 10,000 pound deal this month. Shanghai-Korea and HSBC mutually did 20,000. Da Tong and Sumitomo mutually did 10,000 in March. Anda shipped 5,000 in March, and Hua Bi and Zheng Jin shipped 10,000 in May, with the same price of 375. After 9:30, China and Sumitomo mutually did 10,000 in June.

In the morning, the asking price for January and February was 31 yuan and 125, and the trade price for March and April was 21 yuan and 25, plus 125. Trading was initially very quiet. Later, Mitsui bought 350,000 yuan for 31 yuan and 3125, then shipped 25,000 yuan for a price of 31 yuan and 25, and then offered a term of 50,000 yuan with the same price (from Mobil Oil).

<h3>Massive Collection and Delivery of Silver Dollars at the End of the Month</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the end of the month and a Saturday. Banks were only open for half a day, so various silver dollar collections and deliveries were unable to be signed as scheduled due to time constraints, or it was difficult to implement due to too many procedures. The market was quiet and news was desolate. The paper market opened at a premium price. The morning market was 7 qi and 2 fen and 1 li and a half. The afternoon market was 7 qian and 2 fen and 1 li and 7 hao and a half, slightly less than the previous day. The exchange bills were made. The morning market was 2,095,000, and the afternoon market was 1,100,000. In the banknote paper market, the opening price in the morning market was 200,050, and the afternoon market was 120,000. In the bank trading market, the interbank market was 600,000 in the morning market and 500,000 in the afternoon market. Various bank foreign currency accounts, remittances, and collections are omitted as they could not be investigated. There were also more than 10 million money shop foreign currency bills and 50 to 60 million silver bills. The exact number is not detailed. The silver dismantling was very loose.

<h3>Total Amount of Silver Dismantling Last Month</h3>
<p>The silver dismantling in January was initially firm and then loose. In the first half of the month, it was always above 1 qian. In the second half of the month, it was sometimes several fen. As a result, the total amount for the whole day was 3 taels, 5 qian, and 2 fen. However, there were four days off for New Year's Day. If so, it is necessary to add about 4 or 5 qian for four days of silver dismantling, which would be about 4 taels. The original total amount was calculated according to 26 days, which is 1 qian, 3 fen, 5 li and a half per day. It is expected that the standing committee will propose a deposit interest case of about 4 taels, 95 qian, and Jie's score.</p>
<h3>Securities: Bond Market Strong and Prices Firmly Up</h3>
<p>One-Nine Good Customs Tariff Reorganization and Disarmament Treaty Up One Yuan</p>
<p>Active Trading Reaches a Total of Ten Million Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, although spot trading of various government bonds in the securities market was still sporadic, the futures market was far more active than the previous day. The trend of various bonds was due to the market buying being far greater than before, and large holders were also seen gradually accumulating positions, which eventually led to a steady rise. By the afternoon close, the market had slightly eased. As a result, bonds such as the One-Nine Good Customs Tariff Reorganization and Disarmament Treaty all rose by about one yuan. The One-Nine Customs Consolidation Six also improved by half a yuan, but other fluctuations were still slight. It is estimated that the spot trading for the whole day was 14,000 yuan, and the futures trading was over 4.8 million yuan in the morning and over 5.1 million yuan in the afternoon, totaling over 10 million yuan. Among them, the One-Nine Good Disarmament was the most active, followed by the One-Nine Customs Reorganization and Disarmament, while the others were still relatively calm.</p>

<h3>Yarn &amp; Cotton: Yarn Market's Fierce Rally</h3>
<p>A Glimpse of Panic Among Short Sellers</p>
<p>The yarn market is experiencing a fierce rally, and the momentum is unstoppable. This is mainly because the overseas cotton and yarn market is stable, and exchange rates are difficult to rise, resulting in high prices for imported goods. The bullish sentiment is strong, and short sellers are quite uneasy. Furthermore, there are rumors of instability among various brokerage firms due to financial issues, so those covering shorts are more eager. However, actual yarn trading is flat. Only Rongxing, a long position holder of No. 20 yarn, released over 7,000 bales, but the upward trend is still difficult to curb, which shows the panic of the short side. The human standard is 2 taels higher. The foreign standard opened higher in the early market because the previous day's settlement was suspended for one day, and the situation of foreign cotton was good. Retail investors scrambled to cover shorts, and the rising wind was very obvious. Each rose by 1 tael and 3 qian to 2 taels and 5 qian. In the afternoon, the standard second market trend was still strong, but the leading positions were still covered, and each month rose by 2, 4, 5, and 6 qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 54,150 bales. It was found that Rong purchased 7,450 bales, Yudda 2,550 bales, Gongtai 3,950 bales, and Yi Dayu 1,550 bales. Rui purchased 1,750 bales, Gengfeng 3,900 bales, Yongfeng 1,650 bales, Yiyu 3,400 bales, Changfeng 1,850 bales, Tianlong 1,650 bales, Mingde 1,150 bales, Meiji 1,200 bales, and Yuantai 1,200 bales. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>
<p>| Human Standard Closing Price | Rise/Fall | Open Account |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| April 162 | Up 5 | 713,002 |</p>
<p>| February 159.0 | Up 1 | 543,800 |</p>
<p>| May 135.2 | 762,000 |</p>
<p>| March 160.6 | 369,300 |</p>
<p>| June 163.5 | 234,740 |</p>
<p>Actual Demand Flat, Current Situation. The sales of spot yarns are flat. According to the current goods statistics of each gang's trade for the whole day, there are 820 bales. The same industry entered 660 bales. The market price rose by about 1 tael. Among the guest gangs, 230 bales were imported from the mainland, 130 bales from Hankou, 200 bales from Sichuan, 200 bales from Nanyang, and 60 bales from miscellaneous gangs.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Continues High</h3>
<p>The cotton market is trending firm, and the rise is dramatic. This is because foreign cotton is calm, pressure on tickets is difficult to ease, and combined prices are high and expensive and cannot be imported. However, the source of Han routes is not smooth, so buyers are emboldened and buy without letting go. Various factories gradually intend to purchase spot cotton, so the market situation is even tighter, and scattered shorts are showing signs of panic. However, the Japanese merchant Dongmian Trading Company has concluded a large number of more than 10,000 dan.</p>
<p>Han Standard Rises to 1 Tael. The Han Standard opened higher in the early market. With the rise of American and Indian cotton, the market situation became tighter. The sound of buying was heard in the market, and the situation was unbearable for a while. This month rose 9 qian, and the distant month rose 5 or 6 qian. Although Japanese merchants came out of the cage in the afternoon, the market situation was still strong, and each month rose another 3 or 4 qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 137,500 dan. It was found that Gongtai sold 12,500 dan, Tongxing 5,000 dan, Tianlong bought 7,400 dan, and Deji 5,800 dan. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>
<p>| Han Standard Closing | Rise/Fall | Open Account |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| April 37.80 | Up 2.0 | 125,900 |</p>
<p>| February 37.90 | Up 1.0 | 11,000 |</p>
<p>| May 37.65 | 95,145,500 |</p>
<p>| March 37.75 | 10,146,700 |</p>
<p>| June 37.60 | 95,980,000 |</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Holders Act Speculatively. Various factories are trading spot cotton, and because the yarn market is good and foreign cotton and exchange rates are firm, they intend to purchase quite a bit, so the holders of cotton are keen to act speculatively. According to the source, there are 420 bales of Tonghua. The sales list is as follows: Special Shaanxi Cotton 38.25, Yufeng Factory entered 2,500 pieces, Spot goods delivered to the factory, Special Shaanxi Cotton 38.00, Dacheng Factory entered 100 pieces, Spot goods delivered to the warehouse, Special Shaanxi Cotton 39.25, 39.00, Dacheng Factory entered 100 pieces, Spot goods delivered to the warehouse.</p>
<h3>Foreign Yarn and Cotton Both Show Progress</h3>
<p>American Cotton Rose Another 15 Points. Yesterday, American cotton rose due to good news from Liverpool. Traders purchased, and short positions were covered, so the market situation was strong. It is estimated that futures rose by 11 to 15 points, spot goods rose by 10 points, British cotton futures rose by 6 or 7 points, spot goods rose by 2 points, Egyptian cotton spot goods were unchanged, and Indian cotton rose due to brokers. The price of Pingguoer near and far terms rose by 3 rubies, Aomu La rose by 1 ruby, the far term rose by 4 rubies, and Zhe Luoxi rose by 1 ruby.

<h3>US Cotton Fluctuates Greatly Last Week</h3>
<p>New York, 30th Telegram reports on the cotton market during the week: The cotton market fluctuated irregularly last week. Recently, the market has turned up, and the supply in the south is also clearly more smooth, and there are hedgers selling forward contracts, mostly in May and July. The covering of short positions is gradually fading, and traders' purchases are also limited to price declines, which is suitable for curbing the market's rebound, and the potential trend can be stabilized. According to news from the southern market, the activity of yarn factories is gradually increasing, and it is also heard that Japanese yarn factories will increase working hours from April. This is enough to help the market develop. The news of new cotton arrangement is particularly degraded, especially in the central and eastern cotton belts. The cotton field problem has no development, but the reduction of planting is estimated to have an increasing trend, approximately reducing by 10% to 15%. Attached is the weekly statistics as of the end of the week (unit: thousand bales)</p>

<h3>Food: Rice Market Sales Stagnant, Continuing to Fall</h3>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, each road was delineated at around No. 50, and the capital sales were surprisingly stagnant. The special top of Beizha only opened at 13 yuan, while the general market paper was priced at 12 yuan. As for the superior medium opening paper, it opened at 11 yuan, which was another 1 or 2 jiao lower than the previous day. Observing the later situation, it still needs to fall. The air of the thin folds is desolate, and the small jiao half-yang indica has plummeted. The highest is only 12 yuan. The sharpness of Guan Zuo Dubu is not strong, and each price is small by jiao half yuan. Yin Hua lacks people to ask, and the street stomach is unbearable to say that the top white yuan barely opens at 12 yuan and 7 or 8 jiao. The situation of each type in the general market is quite difficult to last. At present, everyone is consistently short-sighted, and the market is difficult to stand.</p>
<p>South Shanghai: Yesterday, about No. 30 was seen downstream. Changxi Su Tong's various machine japonica retail sales were stagnant, and the market was turned downstream from exhaustion. The special high goods were slow due to scarcity, and the price was high and soft. The actual decline was due to the poor production of the inside road and the news that transport applications had been received, and the overall decline was seen. Even if the buyer's intention to enter is active, it must be a fierce batch. The trend of thin early rice and yang dubu in the south road is not strong, the unsmooth sale of goods and the urgent release of goods by merchants are all giving buyers a chance. The market is changed from fixed to weak and tired to Yin Yuan to receive sales are flat, and the price is still small near corners.</p>
<h3>The Progress of the January Starch Powder Delivery</h3>
<p>31,000 Bags Delivered by Warehouse Receipts</p>
<p>Yesterday was the January delivery. The actual delivery for the whole day was 29,000 bags of Green Soldier Ship, 2,000 bags of Huilong Green Samsung, totaling less than 31,000 bags. Because Fuxin and Fufeng both drew samples in advance, they were all drawn by guest gangs, and the total number was about 250,000 bags. Therefore, the exchange felt lonely. Although January is coming to an end, I am afraid that it will still be difficult to draw samples for February. Now the spot price is still 2 taels, 1 qian, 7 fen and a half, so the rise and fall in the later market will inevitably be unexpected. The futures transaction decreased slightly. The list is below (unit: thousand bags)</p>
<p>| January 680 | February 103 | May 1044 |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| February 646 | April 1592 | June 564 |</p>
<h3>Hardware: 20,000 Sheets of Dong Bai Iron Arrived Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Mitsubishi Corporation and Huishan Warehouse together arrived with 20,000 sheets of spot goods, so the local market situation was more moderate than before. It is heard that the Yangtze River gang has been handling a lot for several days, and the inland river construction gangs have also handled over 5 or 6,000 sheets of New Year's goods. The price is 3.6 feet, 1 tael and 05 fen, and 3.7 feet, 1 tael and 2 qian and 5 fen.</p>
<h3>Chess Copper Spot Shortage</h3>
<p>Recently, spot chess copper has suddenly reported a shortage, and the bid price has skyrocketed, reaching an unprecedented level. It is estimated that each dan is 205 taels. It is heard that customers who want to add this product, such as Sichuan, Hankou, Tianjin, and local furnace workshops, are all looking forward to it day and night.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Fungus Sales Flat</h3>
<p>Recently, the arrival and sales of fungus have been rare, and the market price is still upside down. It is estimated that the cost of handling goods in Hankou is 90 taels, plus all external expenses, it is calculated that Shen is about 104 taels. It is found that the high-grade ear in Shen Market is only 100 taels, and the second-grade paper is not equal to 92 taels. Now, the high-grade village Malanping goods are priced at 104 taels, but the sales are flat and the market is difficult to revive. Yesterday, the village ear was sold for 190 taels and the original brand ear for 102 taels. The trend is flat and tired.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Market Turns Upward Unanimously</h3>
<p>Ice Flower Qing Falls Quite Sharply</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market's production area telegram Cuban spot sugar price remained unchanged. New York futures sugar for March and December both fell by 2 points, May fell by 1 point, and September fell by 3 points. Java spot futures sugar did not rise. The public market's dividing market rose due to the exchange rate. People's sentiment was firmer, and there were not many people going out. The bidding price was also high, and the trading intention was strong. The market rose again. The transaction price was 7 taels and 03 qian. The demand was active, and then the shouting price was 10 taels and 04 qian. The trend was flat. No. 10 medium sand white 9 taels and 9 qian. The transaction of Japanese sugar was still rare, but the market also turned pretty. Meiji YT mark was 10 taels and 04 qian to 4 qian and a half. YRO mark was 10 taels. YP mark was 10 taels and 05 qian and 7 fen to 6 qian. The market shape was outstanding and the number market was silent. The Yonghua Qing Market has been quiet for a long time, because the sale is stagnant and the number is tight. Yesterday, a certain two banks suddenly delineated hundreds of bags, and they were Hong Kong goods. The price plummeted to 8 taels and 9 qian.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Dry Cocoons in Zhejiang Province are Scarce and Expensive</h3>
<p>Superior Spring Cocoons Open at 180 Taels</p>
<p>Last year, the production of cocoons in Hangzhou, Shaoxing, and Jiahu in Zhejiang Province was poor, and the supply was insufficient to meet the demand. The cocoon market was lively day by day. Recently, overseas Shanghai factories sold smoothly through Europe, and silk prices soared. Various silk factories sought to replenish raw materials and started work one after another, resulting in a surprisingly lively cocoon market. Cocoon merchants raised prices and acted speculatively. Although silk prices have fallen back by more than 100 taels, the dry cocoon market is scarce and the market is still firm. Yesterday, it was negotiated at the Chamber of Commerce that 80 dan and 600 catties of high-quality spring dry cocoons in Hangzhou County were priced at 180 taels per dan for winding and discounting. Each silk package requires 1,100 taels of net cocoons, and the factory still has to lose money.</p>
<h3>Foreign Zhuang Silk Sales are Increasingly Uninspired</h3>
<p>European and American silk merchants all believe that Japanese silk prices are cheap and Shanghai factories have sent telegrams that prices are expensive. The telegram has turned silent. Chinese silk merchants are difficult to sell because of the heavy cost and the scarcity of goods. Yesterday, Yihua imported 10 packages of Shanghai White Factory silk and Ganli imported 20 packages of Huang Factory silk. The prices were flat and tired.</p>
<h3>Qining Black Tea Sales in the UK are Slightly Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Yihua, Xiehe, Tianxiang, and Dude, etc. of Qining Yichang and other black tea companies in the UK slightly increased their appetite. More than 600 boxes were traded in the whole city. The sales prices ranged from 30 taels to 46 taels. There was no increase or decrease compared to the previous market. The current inventory of black tea in the market is only more than 2,000 boxes, and it will not be sold out within the year. There is no major development in the green tea market. Yesterday, more than 1,000 boxes of Lanyuan Gaozhuang green tea were shipped from the Yangtze River, and Fuke will uniformly distribute samples next week.</p>

<h3>Children's Art Education</h3>
<p>Ye Qiuyuan</p>
<p>Not long ago, I saw a film about the Mexican Children's Sculpture Institute in a certain cinema. There, many children were doing various sculptures according to their interests. Some used live monkeys or cats and dogs as their models. Their childish artistic talents were vividly displayed in the rough works. My impression is that the Mexican Children's Sculpture Institute is funded by the Mexican government. Any child with artistic interest, especially sculpting interest, can study there without charge. The institute provides materials and instructors. The strong atmosphere and the children's vitality made me feel full of interest and envy. This made me think of the many sculptures in the United States that are made by Mexicans. They have been cultivating their children's artistic literacy since they were young. (Note: The sculpture of the Exchange Mansion recently built in San Francisco, USA, was handled by a Mexican, which aroused strong resentment from local workers and the Art Alliance and caused a serious storm.)</p>
<p>Recalling the barrenness of art education in China today, I don't know when the government will fund children's art institutes like Mexico. The heavy bureaucracy and feudal forces only need a corner of accommodation and a little sympathy to comfort those engaged in art. Chinese art activities have to be concentrated in Shanghai, which is relatively safe, to strive for a gradual enrichment of the artistic atmosphere and a gradual increase in social understanding. A few days ago, Chen Baoyi talked to me about preparing to work hard on the children's painting movement, saying that this movement will be led by (Shanghai Art College). Wang Daoyuan's (new efforts) will also publicize this movement. The attention paid to children's art education can be said to have been concretized.</p>
<p>The movement of children's art education is to cultivate children's artistic talents, and it can also be regarded as a kind of work of socializing and popularizing art. In today's China, this is what is needed. The Chinese government may not be able to fund children's art institutes at present, but the children's art movement led by (Shanghai Art College) may achieve the same results. In today's China, how many things cannot be expected from the government and must be directly organized by the people? This kind of children's art education movement is also an example.</p>
<p>Although the history of (Shanghai Art College) is not very long, its sincerity in engaging in art education can be said to be unparalleled. A year of efforts has received a lot of sympathy from the society. This time, the children's art education movement launched with sincere efforts will surely have ideal results.</p>
<p>Knowing from Wang Daoyuan's (new efforts) and Chen Baoyi's talks that this movement is somewhat concentrated on children's painting and the art curriculum of elementary schools, but in terms of children's art education, I think the following points should be paid attention to:</p>
<p>(1) Children's art education should be multi-faceted. This means that the children's art movement cannot only focus on painting. Children who have talents for sculpture and decorative art but have little interest in painting should be encouraged to develop their unique sculptural or decorative art talents. Education should be based on the child's personality.</p>
<p>(2) Children's art education cannot be entirely based on the elementary school curriculum. The elementary school art curriculum is limited. If there are children with unique talents and interests, their artistic talents should be fully developed. Therefore, a children's art institute should be set up outside the elementary school curriculum to fully cultivate their artistic talents. The above-mentioned children's art institute can be attached to (Shanghai Art College).</p>
<p>However, in China, where art education for children is barren, the above-mentioned plan may not be realized for a while. The children's painting movement advocated by Wang Daoyuan is at least enough to open the children's art education movement. We can only hope for its prosperity and future development.</p>
<h3>Preface to Cheng Huan's (Wasteland Smoke) by Zhang Ruogu</h3>
<p>Mr. Cheng Huanzi is a literary youth I met in the summer of the 16th year of the Republic of China. At that time, I was working in the General Political Department of the National Revolutionary Army in Nanjing. Mr. Cheng wrote me a letter to register for the Central Military and Political School. This first letter is still kept by me as a souvenir of our friendship. According to statistics, Mr. Cheng sent me more than one hundred letters in the three and a half years. Almost every one of these letters is full of enthusiasm and distress. If they are compiled and printed, it is a true confession of the life of a modern young man.</p>
<p>Time flies so fast. In the short three or four years, Mr. Cheng experienced many changes in his life. At first, he was determined to abandon business and join the army, but because of the ties of his family and the siege of the environment, he endured his enthusiasm and still kept his job safely. Later, he returned to his hometown to get married. After marriage, he returned to Shanghai to continue his job in the pawnshop industry. From the surface, it seems that.</p>
