<h3>西班牙廢王</h3>
<p>西班牙因選舉共和黨佔多數王乃退位而出國不得謂爲流血之革命也其去位也視中國以前清室之退位尤爲和平視歐戰時德國革命德廢皇之退位更不可同日而語西班牙人民對之雖不能尊崇宜若可以相諒矣然而據西電所傳某共和社會黨尙宣言欲治廢王以罪也</p>
<p>其宣言所云其一治廢王以所犯之干政治罪與刑事罪其二繳舊時王室軍隊之械以與共和軍其三懲治與舊朝有關係之人如今西班牙之革命新政府是否採用此議雖尙不可知然而其國人對於舊王朝之不能寛恕於此己可見矣</p>
<p>又如西班牙廢王現方由法赴英英國官塲爲之特别戒備以保護之蓋因廢王在巴黎接有恐嚇信之故是則廢王退位之後非特不能見諒於國中抑且不能安居於國外以視中華人民之優待清室其相去何如耶</p>

<p>須俟霧退據公平輪電滬報告昨日午後五時半可以到鯉魚山援救華陽輪船及旅客嗣續接公平電告在五時許駛抵馬鞍島時海面霧露極重該處暗礁林立不能前進衹得抛泊守候霧散後往救現公平輪抛停之處與華陽輪距離約五海哩與一洋商輪同抛該處海面一俟霧退即放舢板往華陽駁載船員等還滬</p>
<p>人員避難華陽輪係海船載重約二千噸價值十萬元兹聞船底己爲礁石穿破船員旅客有無死亡刻尙未能明瞭其己經離船者料己光上小島避難全部人員將由公平救回詳情尙待續報</p>

<h3>太保阿書正法瑣記（上）</h3>
<p>— 竹天</p>
<p>太湖匪首太保阿書徐天雄横行江浙積案如山此次在滬被捕可謂天網恢恢疏而不漏本月十六日由閔行解赴金山縣張堰鎭斬决其胞弟徐福生亦同時伏誅兹據閔行水警第一區中人言述太保阿書兄弟在獄狀况及就刑時前後情形多爲各報所未經揭載者因補誌之</p>
<p>居處優待　太保阿書係拘押於閔行水警第一區署内客廳旁之小室中有沙發數事太保長日無事嘗倚坐小憇又恐其憂悶致病也督察長偵探長等日在其左右盤桓縱天地間事太保因而大樂幾忘其置身獄中矣太保胃量甚佳每食能盡飯三器菜亦極講究魚肉菜筍等羅列滿桌每日菜金平均須一元數角太保爲癮君子日吸鴉片烟十餘元由滬解閔行時己數日未沾唇委頓不堪區署即爲之購到數元無日中斷至行刑之前二日太保自願戒絶屏勿吸謂蒙此間優待感激不盡但來日解往他處寗能再作是想不如早爲之計也同時其弟徐福生則拘押於拘留所與其他罪犯同待遇所謂地位不同歟</p>
<p>攝影交涉　自太保阿書正法消息傳出後滬上各報記者均均趕往閔行隨同出發攝影記者尤爲忙碌益之以徐區長電影機徐區長公子及其他私人之照相機隨往觀刑之法工部局督辦等均手提一架浩蕩蕩極爲熱閙十六日下午一時半太保阿書弟兄解到張堰鎭直解保安隊步兵第二團團部暫息有團附某竟出而禁止攝影喝令副官將各人手提照相機暫存團部俟斬决後再還據稱斬首爲刑法所無不能將照片登報云云各報記者立時提出抗議往返交涉許久最後仍許公開攝影但不許攝斬首照片防其對外宣傳也</p>
<h3>印度遊記（三一）</h3>
<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>寺中菜園花圃風吹香氣殊覺可人余問其僧人亦作工否答菜園甚大有時雇工人有時諸僧自鋤地而植菜余甚贊成農工之僧人此辦法外道勝於内道之坐食矣中國佛徒自六祖以搗米成道其繫腰石在黄梅縣據劉鐘云六祖昔在黄梅作因堆輕故腰繫石以加重便於搗米也其辛苦如此乃能成道豈有坐食之理而今有大勇比丘於臨死以前作一文云僧人永不應作工己足報社會之恩是固非全無理由然豈可行於今日哉又何解於六祖之工人禪卑又見該寺内亦置紡車此蓋甘地之敎僧人亦作工矣太虚師者乃大勇之師久倡農禪工禪之論吾甚贊成之觀於印度敎之自炊與種植而可以知改衣佛徒生活之法矣</p>
<p>白樓寺可以代表印度敎但據僧云此非其本寺乃其一支也本寺在北方不遠之某地云每年四月衆士女自遠方來聚餐於此可數千人云此地白樓宗派共有五寺以外宗派尙不少也至印度敎之優劣一言難盡自佛法言則爲外道意其世法多歟甘地其代表也甘地屢稱格逹經典而不及論佛意者印度敎帶剛性歟總之人生是人生社會社會是複雜搆成亦不能言純是唯物經濟關係更不能過重宗敎政治等乃爲平均論也同一耶敎而歐洲各國興亡不等同一佛敎而日本暹羅興高麗缅甸亡中國同一孔敎而二十四朝代興代滅惟其人耳印度敎僧亦願來華宣傳當此時代亦不必以爲外道而排之應用比較研究歡迎之也吾聞之沈子培前哲云佛圓敎秘宗盡攝諸敎無外道云惜乎中國於印度哲學所得甚少因受佛呵斥故也今萬國文化如百花競美只有用科學之分析比較法爲有益於人生社會之文化也</p>
<p>印度人之相貌是一種有價值之研究本來佛甚重相貌羅漢相頗多奇偉者今觀印度敎名僧飛夫克南之像異常雄偉固印人自詡爲降伏歐美人者然余意不盡然記昔某君見某名僧之像曰此怪物也不爲僧必亂天下如逹摩之怪像與張飛相近矣意亦有種怪人好修怪像若佛像只是慈祥廣大並不怪近甘地像只是一工人平淡無奇我意無所用其怪也雄怪暴露於外只是不祥吾無取焉</p>

<p>昨日粉巿上午開盤後各月份巿面因洋麥報價回小三四五角不等致開價時之人心極形不穩較之前日收盤曾回跌一分左右迨後因業外浮多心思仍堅紛紛爭進故近遠各期又疲而復振下午開船以廠方態度依然觀望近遠均鮮出檔兼以麥巿非但未愛影響反較前日爲佳故業内外心思竟爲帶佳較上午之最低價回振一分半以上結果本月份較好五厘五月份好二厘半六七月份好五厘八九月份好二厘半云</p>

<h3>北行散記</h3>
<p>— 平安</p>
<p>十二　公寓</p>
<p>到了北平第一次巡禮到的北平的特色那是公寓</p>
<p>當幾年前中國的文壇還没從北平搬到上海來的時候常常在一些描寫住在北平的那些流浪的學生的生活的文草上拜識了公寓這一類的生活的風調到了北平說有機會上公寓裏在觀光一回自然高與其實所謂公寓在南方就是所謂「寄宿舍」樣的房子裏面所住的客人大體上全是一些潦倒的窮學生飯餓一次不要緊幾十天不洗一回澡不要緊兩三個月不剃頭不光鬍鬚不要緊或者幾個月老是披着那件藍布衫……全不要緊但是烟不能不抽也許高興再來這麽一杯酒戲不能不看實在没錢得張開了喉嚨自己唱給自己聽尤其是在北平也許還得愛光光窰子要是有什麽新的文藝書新的什麽刋物來了更不能不設法幾毛錢去買一本來看看這些全是浪漫最生活在藝術的生活裏的青年的生活以我個人的推測流浪在北平的公寓裏的窮青年比較住在上海的那些寄宿舍或租着享子間的年青的朋友其生活之潦倒還要利害我的上公寓那是因爲陪一個朋友去看一個朋友的那個朋友的月友便有住在一個破爛的公寓裏朋友也不是一定要我陪但也不是一定說不願意我去旣然我高興同去也好當我到了那公寓裏我眞想不出一句句字可以寫出我在那一霎間的感想自然我還不至於像一個有錢的嬌貴的太太或小姐一旦跑進一家窮人的屋子裏感到那樣的不安侷促然而以最適當的安眼來說明公寓裏的破敗是說它比所謂破落户也者的人家的屋子還來得難看四壁是没有磚頭的當中隔着一層蘆條就在蘆條上糊上一層報報紙破舊的窗也是糊的紙天花板也是報紙糊兩條長凳三四塊木板一架殘壞的洗壞的洗臉架一張破桌子如是便是一個房房小在一個人房大得安排下兩張或三張床人便在那樣可憐的天花板下住下來了自然什麽事情都是一慣縱使那種生活可怕但住慣了也便没有什麽我去的時候正是冬天房子裏生着火是一架瓦爐燒的不是煤是煤　主人看是我們來了去買了一些花生米幾條糖倒一杯熱水於是大家圍在火爐旁看看報談談天不消說這種生活是很有風趣的人們對於生活上的Taste各人相異這種生活有一部份人是無論如何過不來的但另外一部分就能安之若素而且高興我想過這種生活的人看起來是窮其實倒也並不一定是因爲窮的關係有一些也是因爲趣味的關係尤其是年青的人年青的學生對於這一種生活頂合胃口關於這種生活有好處也有壞處說他的好壞自然並非指物質上的說法我是說這一種生活對於住在這種生活裏的人的思想與學問的事就是說上進不上進的事現在的敎育是完全失敗了的是完全騙人的就在正在讀着書的學生們也未常不明白這一點但因循的傳統思想縛住一個人的心當眞說因爲現在的敎育失敗在不學讀書騙人得去換另一種方式去求學問的事倒底又没有勇氣去實行你怎知道脫離這學校生活後是否自己的意志會堅决地不受外界一些些誘惑呢誰也不敗回答這句話所以結果明知在大學讀書是騙父母是騙自己也没辦法衹好糊裏糊塗過下去敎書的先生也一樣先生敎書最好不要去想什麽是否自己的敎書所能使學生得多少得了多少又能影響於國家社會多少敎書的先生要去想這些事他們應該去自殺敎書的先生最好衹按時到校上課按日拿錢一切讓他糊糊下去因爲根本上没有辦法</p>
<p>話兜了太遠得歸正題說住在公寓裏什麽浪漫的生活都可以做得出没有人來管束你能來管束你的便衹有你自己說往活浪漫也並不是一定說生活不上進你知道經騐學問不一定都是從書本上得來的經騐學問是從許多實際的行爲上得來的實際行爲可以牽動心理的變化心理變化可以牽動思想的變化所以有人說出去玩一天比在家讀一天書好住在公寓裏的人如其自己有一個經緯那就是說對於你自己的學業有一個計劃有一個成竹即使偶而荒唐幾天而仍然能不跑得太遠遠到不可收拾了遠到跑不回來則我想信那種自由的讀書（自然得請人指導是另外件事）自由的思索自由的探訪該比在這些好像肺病養成所的大學校裏讀死書吃飯起身睡覺要有功效得多多</p>

<h3>Central Political Council Foreign Affairs Group Discusses Legal Rights Issue</h3>
<p>Wang Zhengting Reports on Negotiation Progress</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At the Central Political Council's Foreign Affairs Group meeting on the 21st, Wang Chonghui, Sun Ke, Wang Zhengting, Kong Xiangxi, special secretary Li Jinlun, Xie Guansheng, and Xu Mo, director of the European and American Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, etc., decided that the legal rights issue should still be actively negotiated by Minister Wang with relevant countries. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Today, the Central Political Council's Foreign Affairs Group discussed the legal rights issue. Foreign Minister Wang reported on the progress of negotiations and the concessions made by Britain. Our side considered the results unsatisfactory and decided that the move to automatically declare the recovery of rights would be delayed based on the current situation. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) British Ambassador Lampson and Foreign Minister Wang discussed the most important points of legal rights. Some concessions have been made, but our demands have not been fully accepted. The British Ambassador has telegraphed his government for instructions. (21st Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain foreign envoy told people that the nations have made some concessions on the legal rights issue compared to before. It is impossible to predict whether this can be resolved or will be delayed further. In short, the nations are still leaving room for negotiation. It is expected that in the current situation, China will not make a general declaration of recovery because the process and steps discussed by the various countries are completely different and cannot be included in a single document. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>London Conservative member of Parliament, Mr. Mill, asked in the House of Commons today whether the British Ambassador to China had received instructions to sign any treaty between China and Britain. Foreign Secretary Henderson replied that Ambassador Lampson is currently negotiating the issue of consular jurisdiction. The government has not issued instructions to sign because there is no agreement between China and Britain. However, he cannot promise that the House of Commons must consider the terms of the agreement before signing because the government must bear the responsibility of signing at the appropriate time. (20th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Drafting Conference of the Provisional Constitution</h3>
<p>Draft to be Submitted to the Central Standing Committee Tomorrow</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Drafting Conference of the Provisional Constitution was held at the Central Conference Hall at 3:00 PM on the 21st.

Chairman Wang Chonghui presented the entire draft of the Provisional Constitution, a total of eight chapters and more than eighty articles, and discussed them chapter by chapter. The discussions on the three chapters concerning the rights and obligations of the people, the livelihood of the people, and national education were very detailed. The meeting adjourned at about 6:00 PM, and it was decided to hold another meeting after the Central Political Council meeting on the morning of the 22nd to continue discussing the chapters on government organization, etc. After the discussions are completed, the draft will be finalized and submitted to the Central Standing Committee for discussion and approval on the 23rd. In addition, the issue of proposals to the National Assembly was originally planned to be studied after the Provisional Constitution Conference. However, because the discussion of the Provisional Constitution took a long time, there was no time to discuss it, so it has been changed to be discussed at the same time when the Provisional Constitution Conference is held on the 22nd.

(21st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Xueming was hospitalized for stomach illness yesterday, and he was discharged from the German Hospital this afternoon after recovering slightly. He visited guests everywhere. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chiang Kai-shek was very pleased that Zhang Xueliang was going to Beijing to participate in the National Assembly and ordered the Ministry of Railways to prepare first-class carriages at Kaiping to welcome him. Wu Tiecheng was asked to convey his welcome and accompany him to Beijing. It is rumored that Zhang plans to take the "Pode" aircraft to Beijing, but it has not been decided yet.

<h3>Xu Yongchang Went to Beiping Yesterday</h3>
<p>Shang Zhen's Remarks After Arriving in Beiping</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) Xu Yongchang went to Beiping on the afternoon of the 21st. Rong Honglu returned to Taiyuan on the 21st. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Shang Zhen arrived in Beiping this afternoon and told reporters that he came to Beiping this time to meet with Zhang and report on the current financial and military situation in Shanxi. He has no proposals of his own and is only providing consultations. Xu Yongchang is ill and did not travel with him. He decided to come to Beiping on the 22nd. Li Shengda and Wang Jingguo are in Taiyuan, and Yang Xiaoou is in Lu'an, waiting for Yang Yaofang and others to return to Beiping before coming again. The loan from the British and American Tobacco Company is a rumor. Shanxi Province receives 16 million yuan in military expenses and spends 31.2 million yuan in political expenses and 8 million yuan. The revenue and expenditure are short 23 to 4 million yuan. The new tax to be levied in the future will only bring in 1 to 2 million yuan. After meeting with Zhang, the issues will be resolved one by one. He himself will not go to Beijing and will return to Taiyuan in a few days. Feng Yuxiang's whereabouts after leaving Fenyang are unknown. Secretary Guo Zengkai is still in Taiyuan. Shang Zhen's plan to go abroad was approved by both Chiang and Zhang and should not be a problem. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Li Peiji came to Beiping last night to meet with Zhang and report on the situation in Suiyuan. Suiyuan's annual income is more than 4 million yuan, but after the abolition of Likin, it is only more than 2 million yuan. The consumption tax has not been implemented, and the income has been reduced by another 600,000 yuan. The land in Suiyuan is barren and the people are poor, and they often suffer from having too many soldiers. It is estimated that there are three cavalry brigades of Zhao Chengshou, Guo Fengshan, and Sun Changtai, two infantry divisions of Wang Jingguo and Fu Zuoyi, and three battalions of military police under Yuan Qingzeng. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Chongqing) The provincial side has softened on the Beidao incident. The 24th Army has withdrawn from Suining. Deng Xihou will hand over the two counties of Xichong and Shehong to Li Qixiang in the near future. Li Qixiang, Luo Zezhou, and Yang Sen are meeting in a certain town in Shunqing to thoroughly cooperate in military, political, and economic aspects. Chen Shunong has retreated to Anyue and has no supplies. He recently sent a representative to Chongqing to see Liu Xiang, expressing his sincerity and support, and requesting assistance. Liu intends to let Dazu be Chen's defense area, which is currently being negotiated. The situation in Sichuan can be temporarily maintained in peace. (21st Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Shanghai newspapers previously reported that Li Qixiang repented to Deng Xihou. Li telegraphed to Beijing on the 20th, saying that Deng was instigated by Liu Wenhui and suffered great losses in strength, so he fabricated the rumor to save face. (21st Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Sichuan situation described by the personnel stationed in Beijing by Liu Xiang and Liu Wenhui is different. Most politicians are indeed in Chengdu. Zeng Qi, of the State Ist Party is also in Neijiang. The Jiangjin meeting has not been successful. No war has yet broken out between the two Lius. The local products planted in the five counties including Dazu can be harvested at the end of May. Liu Wenhui is still in Chongqing and is still in contact with Deng and Tian.

<h3>Details of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Accident</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Guangzhou-Kowloon train derailed on the evening of the 20th, destroying the locomotive and four passenger cars, killing and injuring more than ten people. It will take about a week to repair. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway train derailed near Shatin last night while heading to Kowloon. The locomotive and three carriages fell into a valley 30 feet below and were completely broken. It is now estimated that at least 30 people are dead and about 20 to 30 people are seriously injured. The cause of the accident was due to heavy rains in recent days causing the embankment to loosen. When the train overturned, it broke the tracks, and the falling earth and rocks blocked the road parallel to the railway, making it difficult for rescuers. The scene of the accident tonight is tragic. Men, women, old and young, trapped in the cars were struggling to escape amidst screams. After the accident, a large team of police, firefighters, and railway employees rushed to the scene to carry out rescue operations, but the situation was very dangerous because the mountain was still collapsing and threatening to bury the victims and rescuers. At midnight tonight, there are still groans at the bottom of the valley, proving that there are still several people who have not been rescued. Many doctors and nurses have organized a temporary first-aid station near the accident site. Those who are seriously injured are sent to Kowloon Hospital by sick car, and the rest are arranged to stay overnight in the homes of Chinese and foreign residents nearby. It is heard that all the passengers in the car were Chinese. It is also reported that eleven bodies have been recovered, and it is estimated that there are still about 20 people who have not been rescued. Two young children were found this morning with their knees pressed by steel objects. Although they had suffered all night, they were still alive and conscious. The rescuers tried to remove the pressed objects, but they could not do so after exhausting all their strength. They administered anesthesia and amputated the legs to remove them. Due to the damage to the tracks, the train service is completely suspended and will take about two weeks to repair before it can operate as usual. (21st Reuters Telegram)</p>

<h3>The Abdicated King of Spain</h3>
<p>Because the Republican Party won the majority in the Spanish elections, the king abdicated and left the country. This cannot be called a bloody revolution. His abdication was even more peaceful than the abdication of the Qing Dynasty in China and cannot be compared with the abdication of the German Emperor during the German Revolution in the European War. Although the Spanish people cannot respect him, it seems that they can understand each other. However, according to the Western telegram, a certain Republican Socialist Party also declared that it wanted to try the abdicated king for his crimes.</p>
<p>The declaration stated the following: First, the abdicated king should be tried for the political and criminal crimes he committed. Second, the weapons of the old royal army should be confiscated and given to the Republican army. Third, those who were related to the old dynasty should be punished. Although it is not yet known whether the new government of Spain will adopt this proposal after the revolution, it can be seen from this that the people of the country cannot forgive the old dynasty.</p>
<p>Moreover, the abdicated King of Spain is now going from France to England, and the British authorities are taking special precautions to protect him because the abdicated king received threatening letters in Paris. Therefore, the abdicated king cannot only not be forgiven in his own country, but also cannot live in peace abroad. How different is this from the preferential treatment of the Qing Dynasty by the Chinese people?</p>

<h3>Spanish Republic's New Regulations Adopt British System</h3>
<p>Deposed King Goes to England Via France</p>
<p>Special Security Measures Along the Way</p>
<p>Socialist Party Demands Punishment of Alfonso</p>
<p>Serious Financial Crisis Occurs in Barcelona</p>
<p>Reuters, Beijing, 20th – The Belgian government has recognized the government of the Spanish Republic.</p>
<p>Reuters, Madrid, 21st – The Spanish Minister of Justice yesterday met with the presidents of the Supreme Court and other courts, informing them of the need to thoroughly revise Spanish regulations, advocating the adoption of the British system within the scope suitable for Spanish needs.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 20th – Deposed Spanish King Alfonso will depart for London tomorrow to arrange for his third son, John, to study at the British Naval Academy. John, 18, was previously an apprentice naval officer in Cadiz. After the revolution, he fled abroad and is now traveling from Italy to London. After arriving in England, Alfonso will meet with the British King at Windsor Palace, but will only stay in England for a few days before returning to France. His eldest son has recovered from his illness.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 20th – Deposed Spanish King Alfonso is expected to arrive in London tonight. Government officials are taking special security measures to protect him. Fifty detectives familiar with political fanatics, their personalities, and methods will be deployed at Victoria Station. No one will be allowed on the platform without special permission. The reason for these precautions is that Alfonso received threatening letters in Paris.</p>
<p>Reuters, Madrid, 21st – A Republican Socialist Party organ published a manifesto demanding the trial of deposed King Alfonso for his political and criminal offenses. The manifesto listed various demands, including the immediate surrender of weapons by the old regime's army to the Republican army, the punishment of Alfonso and those related to the old regime. It also stated that Alfonso is strongly suspected of not only repeatedly committing political crimes but also engaging in various illegal activities during his reign, especially using the last dictatorship of Primo de Rivera as a shield. It is reported that the authorities plan to store military equipment sufficient for 150,000 laborers in Madrid to prevent unforeseen events. The government is also considering exempting laborers and commissioned officers from income tax, regardless of their income level.</p>
<p>Reuters, Madrid, 21st – People are flocking to Madrid to deposit securities in various banks and mortgage properties to banks. The Minister of Finance has requested banks to advise customers to remain calm, stating that regulations to punish those disrupting the financial system will be announced soon. A serious wave of bankruptcies has reportedly occurred in Barcelona, with the exchange rate falling and the business community suffering greatly. Commercial activity has almost completely stopped. The issue of stabilizing the currency cannot be resolved until the convocation of the parliament. Therefore, the government plans to expedite the general election to avoid unfavorable political reactions and hinder mining.</p>
<p>National News, Madrid, 20th – Today, the cabinet decided to make May 1st, Labor Day, a national holiday in Spain. Some say that the new government is taking steady steps and leaning left, causing complaints from left-wing figures. Therefore, the government had to use this to slightly appease public sentiment. Also, according to reports, there are signs of unrest in Spanish Morocco. News from London indicates that the riots by radicals in Tangier may endanger Morocco's international status. British authorities have deployed heavy troops in Gibraltar so that they can immediately go to Tangier if necessary. However, Spanish news strongly denies this, stating that Tangier is as peaceful as Spain itself and other territories.</p>
<h3>Portuguese Colony's Rebellion Suppressed</h3>

<h3>Turkey's Opium Production Surprisingly High</h3>
<p>Mostly Exported Abroad</p>
<p>Reuters, Cairo, 20th – The Turkish government intends to establish a monopoly on the manufacture of narcotics and plans to take over three existing narcotics factories in Constantinople starting in September. The discovered figures of opium are noteworthy. Turkey's opium production is estimated at 480,000 kilos per year, of which 400,000 kilos are exported abroad. If all the production were converted into morphine, it would yield 56 tons of morphine per year. According to League of Nations experts, the world's legal need is only 10 tons per year. Seven kilos of Turkish opium are worth 10 pounds and can be made into one kilo of morphine worth 33 pounds. Last month, Constantinople factories reported a total stock of 1,995 kilos of heroin and 500 kilos of morphine.</p>
<h3>Japan-Soviet Fishing Zone Issue</h3>
<p>Soviet Russia Disregards Japanese Demands</p>
<p>Holds Solo Bidding</p>
<p>Denstu News Agency, Tokyo, 21st – The Japanese Consul General in Vladivostok telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, reporting that the Soviet Far East Fisheries Department completely disregarded Japan's request to postpone the fishing zone bidding and still carried out the second fishing zone bidding at 1:00 PM on the 20th as scheduled. Only Russians participated, and no Japanese. The results of the bidding may be announced at 3:00 PM this afternoon.</p>
<p>Denstu News Agency, Tokyo, 21st – Japanese foreign ministry authorities believe that the Russian side disregarded Japan's request to postpone the bidding and intend to instruct Ambassador Hirota to Russia to negotiate with Russia regarding the fishing zone bidding. The Japanese government believes that a fishing zone bidding without legitimate Japanese participation is not valid under the treaty and is awaiting a reply. Depending on the content of the reply, an extraordinary cabinet meeting will be held to decide on the final attitude. In fact, even if the ruble issue is resolved and the bidding is held again, the fishing season in western Kamchatka will soon end this year. Only the salmon and trout fishing zones are left. After winning the bid, it will take at least a month to prepare for fishing. Therefore, if the second bidding is not held as soon as possible, the operation of the new fishing zones this year may be hopeless.</p>

<h3>Case of French Officers Privately Photographing German Military Photos</h3>
<p>Serious Nature Beyond Initial Expectations</p>
<p>National News, Berlin, 20th – The three French officers who previously photographed inside the German barracks in Königsberg have now been ordered by the French Embassy in Germany to immediately leave East Prussia and exit Germany. After receiving this order, they left Germany and entered Poland. After checking the photos they carried, the seriousness of their nature exceeded initial expectations. The camera used was a motion picture camera, and the object photographed was an experiment with a shell aiming machine inside the German barracks. This type of aiming machine cannot be made public. Moreover, all three are officers of the French General Staff, and two of them are members of the French so-called Second Bureau, namely the military intelligence department. As the case expanded, German newspapers now expect the government to take further action and demand that the French government recall the French Consul in Königsberg and a certain military officer from the French Embassy, because the Consul acted as a guide for the three officers, and one of the three officers is an officer from the French Embassy.</p>

<h3>Progress in Preparing for the Aviation Conference</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Military Affairs believes that now that military operations have ended and construction has begun, aviation is a vital undertaking. However, this is a major matter, and the entire nation should have an overall plan to enable the central government and the provinces to work together for development. It is necessary to quickly convene a national aviation conference with collective wisdom and unified planning. Therefore, on January 10th, the Ministry presented this reasoning to the Executive Yuan, which was approved at the 10th National Government Affairs Meeting and submitted to the National Government for approval. Since the aviation conference had been approved, all related matters were prepared by the Aviation Department. Cao Baoqing, Zhao Yunpeng, Wang Tianchi, Cha Zhenhu, Li Jingyuan, Zheng Shouyi, Yan Shoukang, and Ren Liangxi were appointed as eight preparatory committee members to organize the preparatory committee. The committee's rules of procedure, secretariat rules, and rules of deliberation were drafted by the preparatory committee based on the original plan and approved and implemented by the Ministry of Military Affairs' administrative meeting. The conference expenses were budgeted at the lowest possible level based on previous conferences, totaling 17,428 yuan, including 10,598 yuan for hospitality, 230 yuan for salaries (clerks and stenographers), 600 yuan for equipment, and 6,000 yuan for office expenses, printing, and miscellaneous expenses. This was submitted for approval and approved by the 18th National Government Affairs Meeting of the Executive Yuan and referred to the Ministry of Finance for allocation. The budget resolution will be announced separately in the future. On the other hand, in accordance with Article 2, Item 17 of the regulations, experts were selected and hired, including Yao Xijiu, Li Ruyan, Shen Dexie, Nie Kaiyi, Qin Guoyong, Zhu Binhou, Chen Wenlin, Qian</p>
<p>Changzuo, Lin An, and Fei Zhemin, a total of eighteen.</p>
<p>With the preparations for the aviation conference well underway, the preparatory committee was dissolved on April 3rd, and the secretariat was established to handle daily affairs. For the convenience of operations, the secretariat was divided into four sections: (1) Document Section, responsible for: 1. Telephoning the provincial and municipal governments, aviation agencies, and experts to request representatives to attend; 2. Requesting the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government General Headquarters, and the five Yuan to send representatives to participate and provide guidance at the opening ceremony; 3. Telephoning aviation agencies to request past work reports to be brought to the conference; (2) Deliberation Section, responsible for: 1. Creating a member registration book and a proposal registration book; 2. Organizing proposals; 3. Hiring stenographers; (3) Editorial Section, responsible for: 1. Preparing to publish periodicals; 2. Devising slogans; 3. Writing propaganda materials; (4) General Affairs Section, responsible for: 1. Establishing a reception center; 2. Printing conference regulations and purchasing necessary items; 3. Arranging the venue.</p>
<p>For the convenience of the conference, it was decided that the venue would be within the Aviation Department. However, due to the short time and limited space, the arrangements would be simple, especially for the reception, which would be limited by the budget. Recently, as the conference date approached, the staff was busy with work, working day and night. All the necessary procedures have been completed. As of the evening of the 19th, a total of 71 members have registered, and 168 proposals have been received. This is the situation of the aviation conference preparations.</p>
<p>The proposals received by the aviation conference have been classified according to Article 6 of the rules of procedure as follows: (1) Matters concerning the construction and development of aviation: 22 items; (2) Matters concerning aviation legislation: 11 items; (3) Matters concerning the expansion of the air force: 11 items; (4) Matters concerning national defense aviation: 13 items; (5) Matters concerning private aviation: 8 items; (6) Matters concerning international aviation: 5 items; (7) Matters concerning aviation education and training: 33 items; (8) Matters concerning the dissemination of aviation knowledge to the public: 6 items; (9) Matters concerning aviation safety: 6 items; (10) Matters concerning aircraft manufacturing: 15 items; (11) Matters concerning the aviation industry: 4 items; (12) Matters concerning aviation funding: 11 items; (13) Matters concerning auxiliary aviation affairs: 24 items.</p>

<h3>Revival of Peace in Guangxi Province</h3>
<p>Li, Zhang, Bai, and others retreat from Longzhou to engage in military training.</p>
<p>Nanning is vacated to allow Huang Shaoxiong to handle the aftermath.</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Since Huang Shaoxiong, representing Xia Wei, went to Nanning to explain the peace plan in detail, Li, Zhang, and others realized that obstructing peace in a corner was not beneficial, and considering the years of war in Guangxi and the survivors, they could not help but be moved, so they agreed to a conditional peaceful solution. The recent peace plan was slightly modified. The item of Li, Bai, etc., going abroad is a temporary plan that has not yet been implemented. However, on the one hand, in order to respect the peace process, the troops in Nanning and Liuzhou will be withdrawn as soon as possible to facilitate the handling of the aftermath. Superintendent Huang Shaoxiong returned to Nanning to take charge of everything. It is reported that Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, Zhang Fakui, and other three people went to Longzhou together on the 3rd of this month and at the same time ordered the troops stationed in Yong and Liu to withdraw to the Longzhou and Tiannan area. Only Huang Shaoxiong's old troops Huang Xuchu's unit remained in the city of Nanning. After Li and others arrived in Longzhou, they have been focusing on military training in Longzhou recently, and have opened a military training school in the old Jiangwutang in Henan. Li Zongren is the principal, Zhang Fakui is the deputy, and Bai Chongxi is the educational director. There are currently more than 2,000 officers and staff enrolled. Their troops are stationed in Baise, Jingxi, and Ningming and other places. As for the military expenditure of the Zhang Gui army, it is said that it is entirely dependent on the opium tax in the area. In the past, the opium tax was 20 yuan in legal currency per 100 taels, but now it has been increased to 50 yuan. Longzhou is the main outlet for Yunnan opium exports, with exports of no less than 10 million yuan per year, so Li and others have increased the opium tax, which alone is more than enough for military expenditure. As for the Eighth Route Army, there is still a division and a brigade stationed there. It will be completely withdrawn after the Guangxi situation has completely reached peace. (April 17)</p>
<h3>Eighth Route Army Suppresses Bandits on the Jiangxi-Fujian Border</h3>
<p>Huang's Brigade of the North River enters Xinfeng from Nanxiong.</p>
<p>Zhang's Brigade of the East River enters Fengshi from the Fujian border.</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The Eighth Route Army of Guangdong has recently been actively carrying out bandit suppression work. After the Third Regiment of the First Independent Brigade, Zhong Fangjun's unit, returned to Zhaoqing, the local authorities believed that bandits were rampant in Luoding, extorting tolls and fees from travelers, and that the bandits should be wiped out. Therefore, Zhong's regiment was sent to Luoding Jiangkou and other areas to be stationed to quell the banditry. In addition, large gangs of bandits have recently been discovered in the Lianyang area of the Little North River, burning, killing, looting, and being extremely rampant. The 63rd Division stationed in the North River reported on the 12th of this month that it had ordered three regiments to go and severely suppress them. The Third Independent Regiment, Deng Hui's unit, the Supplementary Regiment, Lin Bin's unit, and the 252nd Regiment, Ouyang Xin's unit, have been ordered to completely eliminate the bandits in the Little North River within a week. As for the Nanxiong area, it has always been the responsibility of the 63rd Division, Huang Yanzhen's brigade, to deploy defenses. Recently, because the 19th Route Army of Jiangxi Province launched a large-scale campaign against the Communists on the border of Northeast Guangdong, martial law was declared at the same time. The Eighth Route Army was also ordered by the Central Government to appropriately dispatch troops to enter Jiangxi to protect transportation. Therefore, the 125th Brigade (ie, Huang Yanzhen's brigade) in Nanxiong has actively replenished and opened to the Jiangxi southern Xinfeng area for concentration. The brigade headquarters has moved to Nanxiong yesterday, with the 249th Regiment of the brigade, Guo Runhua's unit, as the vanguard, and the Supplementary Regiment, Yan Yingyu's unit, following behind, and the 250th Regiment, Tan Langxing's unit, as the reserve. On the 13th, Guo's regiment had arrived in Xinfeng, Yan's regiment had reached Dayu, and Tan's regiment and the brigade headquarters had set off in the next few days. In the past few days, the brigade has purchased a lot of rice, grain, and medicine, and transported them to Shaozhou in batches for delivery to the front line. Since the 19th Route Army of Jiangxi Province was ordered to launch a general offensive against the Red bandits, the 60th and 61st Divisions have been dispatched separately. The 60th Division, under the jurisdiction of Cai Tingkai, has advanced to Yudu with the 119th and 120th Brigades and the division headquarters. The 119th Brigade, Liu Zhanxiong's unit, had a fierce battle with Peng Dehuai's bandits in the Longgang area. On the 8th, Liu's brigade had defeated Peng's bandits. Now the 120th Brigade has followed closely behind to assist the 119th Brigade in attacking Ningdu. According to the recent situation of bandit suppression in Jiangxi, the front line has gradually shifted to eastern Jiangxi. Eastern Jiangxi is adjacent to western Fujian and the East River of Guangdong, so the Fujian-Guangdong border has to be seriously guarded. The Fujian army Zhang Zhen Liu Heding and other units have now been stationed in Longyan. The remaining bandits are scattered in Wuping Shanghang and other places. It is reported that a split has occurred within the bandit party, and a fire fight has occurred. A group plans to escape to Jiaoling on the Guangdong border. The First Independent Brigade Zhang Ruigui's unit currently stationed in the upper reaches of the Han River will be opened to Fengshi and other places on the Fujian border to assist in defense. (April 15)</p>
<h3>Han Fuju Returns to Jinan</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Provincial Chairman Han Fuju, believing that the joint military suppression of the Baodugu bandits has been arranged properly, and that the military and political affairs of the province urgently need to be dealt with in Jinan, returned to Jinan by special train from knee county today. The train passed through Yanzhou at 1:25 pm, passed through Taian at 5:45 pm, and arrived at Zhangxia at 8:30 pm. Military and political figures gathered at the station to welcome him. At 9:30 pm, the special train entered the station. Han got off the train, shook hands with the welcomers, and talked about the bandit suppression situation at the front, saying that the bandits in southern Shandong in Mengshan had been completely eliminated, and those around Baodugu had also been resolved. It is estimated that 70% of the bandits have been eliminated, with only 30% remaining near Baodugu. The general attack order will be issued on the evening of the 15th. Because Chen's division on the south side</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>Chief (Yaohan)'s troops were a longer distance away, they only arrived on the evening of the 17th, so the attack only started yesterday. On the same day, they reached the first predetermined destination. Today they continued to attack for a day and have reached the second destination. Tomorrow, in another day, they will reach the final destination. The bandit nest around Baodugu is only a few dozen li in circumference, and there are not many bandits left, so it will not be difficult to resolve. However, the four counties of Linyi Tengyi Fei have been ravaged by bandits for a long time, and the villages have been destroyed. In the future, they must be divided into four special zones to handle the aftermath and appease the refugees. There is no need for me to return to the front, etc. After talking about this, Han took a car back to the provincial government. Zhang Yue of the Provincial Committee, Inspection Director Li Tianni, and inspectors from various departments also returned to Jinan with Han. According to Zhang, although the Baodugu mountain is dangerous, it is now surrounded by troops. The area is about 50 to 60 li wide from east to west and only 20 to 30 li from north to south. The area is very small and water is very scarce. According to local people, there are no less than 10,000 bandits, and the water in the valley is definitely not enough. It will soon collapse. The military affairs at the front will be temporarily handled by Chief of Staff Liu Shuxiang after Chairman Han returns to the province. (19th)</p>
<h3>Dong Railway Decides to Restore Zhalanuoer Mine</h3>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: The Zhalanuoer Coal Mine was destroyed by the Russian army in the winter of the 18th year. Afterwards, the Russian side wanted to promote the sale of its Sucheng and Cherkhsky coal, and strongly opposed the restoration of the Zha mine. In the spring of the 19th year, there were several disputes between the Chinese and Russian directors of the Dong Railway Board of Directors. The Russian side insisted that the restoration of the mine would require a large amount of money, as much as 2 to 3 million, and that the coal seams had been exhausted. If it were to be restored, it would be necessary to start a new stove, find a specialized engineer to explore, and purchase new machinery before mining could be carried out. However, the arrangement of funds and the time required for the purchase and transportation of machinery meant that actual mining would take at least two years. They used excuses to exaggerate and tried their best to obstruct it. It was not until the end of the year that it was agreed to first carry out small-scale mining. Ding Tao, the Chinese mine director, recruited more than 100 workers to dig in the mining area. This year, before Mo Dehui went abroad, the Russian side suddenly took the lead in advocating the restoration of the mine. Mo took the opportunity to inspect the mining area on his way abroad and learned that the coal seams were exposed and could be mined without machinery. Moreover, the coal seam in Xiaobeigou is the thickest, and it is expected that 100 million tons of coal can be produced. Manual mining is also very convenient, so it was decided to agree to the Russian proposal. The Materials Department of the Railway Bureau planned the restoration. The Russian side's initial reluctance and sudden advocacy of restoring the mine is said to be due to the current shortage of coal in Russia, which is waiting for the supply of foreign coal. The coal seam of its largest Sucheng coal mine in the Far East suddenly discovered rocks last month, which made mining difficult and coal production sharply reduced. As a result, the delivery of coal as scheduled in the contract with Dong Railway has also been delayed and shortened for the past two months. It will not be easy for the mine to restore its original output in a short period of time, so it agreed to restore the Zha mine. Now the Materials Department of the Railway Bureau has drafted a plan for the restoration of the Zha mine and submitted it to the director of the Railway Bureau for review by the Board of Directors. The restoration fund is set at 500,000 rubles. The work can start whenever the funds are allocated. In addition to setting up an electric light factory to generate electricity and absorb water from the mining area, this restoration will still use manual excavation. The price of coal produced by manual labor, including freight, is about 3 rubles per ton, which is one to two times cheaper than Sucheng coal (the price of Sucheng coal purchased by the railway is 5 rubles per ton). Crushed coal will also be purchased by a machine to roll into coal balls and sold to lower-level households at a low price. (16th)</p>
<h3>Recent Situation of Jiawang Coal Mine</h3>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: The Jiawang Coal Mine is located northeast of Xuzhou City and has a large output. Although its heating power is inferior to that of Zaozhuang Coal Mine, it is convenient to extract and use, so many people use it. However, in recent years, the management has not been effective, resulting in no improvement and frequent labor unrest. The mining area has been reorganized three times. The recent situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Jiawang Mine was originally operated solely by Yuan Shichuan and was called the Jiawang Company. It was prepared at the end of the Qing Dynasty and started in the early years of the Republic of China. Coal was actually produced in the third year of the Republic of China. Later, it was taken over by Yuanji Company for more than a year and lost 400,000 yuan. Recently, Huadong took over Jiawang Company. The manager of Yuanji Company was Chen Xiaoan, and the general manager was Hu Zhonghan. The shareholders were Yan Huiyu. Today, the shareholders of Huadong Company are Liu Hongsheng and Cheng Wenqin. Huang Zhaoxiu is the general manager and Huang Zhaoxiu is the mine manager. There are twelve departments: civil engineering, coal exploration, coal mining, mechanical and electrical, general affairs and security, chemical testing, coal sales, vehicle affairs, materials and land, and worker welfare. Each department has a director and clerks to assist.</p>
<p>When the mining area was Jiawang Company, there were only coal wells No. 1, 2, and 3. Yuanji Company added coal wells No. 4 and 5. Currently, wells No. 1 and 2 have been destroyed, and wells No. 3, 4, and 5 are being repaired. Huadong has added wells No. 6 and 7. The depth of the well is about 300 zhang. The inner square has been mined to a dozen li. The round diameter of the well mouth is about 30-40 zhang. The daily output of coal can be 200 tons, and the daily expenditure is about 60,000 yuan. The company has also purchased new motors and will use machine coal production. In the past, coal was burned for steam power, but now it has been changed to electric power. According to the coal exploration office's exploration to a depth of 160 zhang, there are three layers of coal. The first layer is about 2 chi, the second layer is about 4 chi, and the third layer is about 6 chi. If it is thoroughly mined, it is indeed the only source of benefits for Xuzhou.

<h3>Taxpayers' Association Letter to the Public Works Department Urging Expansion of Elementary Education</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council of Chinese Taxpayers yesterday sent a letter to the Public Works Department of the Public Concession, which stated: "Greetings. It is the responsibility of municipal authorities to popularize elementary education, and it is an essential plan for sound municipal administration. With this in mind, this association solemnly mentioned this issue in an exchange of letters with your department on March 26, 1928. However, three years have passed, and only three elementary schools have been established successively. The construction of the Second Elementary School has been repeatedly delayed, and it is said that it will not be available until the autumn of next year, which is quite unsatisfactory. Even the recently proposed eight-year education plan seems to indicate that your department is beginning to pay attention to elementary education to fulfill its municipal responsibilities. However, in the view of this association, it is still far from the goal of popularization. We urge your department to improve this plan so that all school-age children within the concession can enjoy the right to elementary education by the end of 1938. Furthermore, the budget for the planned school facilities does not need to be so large. In the opinion of this association, if your department entrusts the prescribed funds to Chinese education experts, the same amount of funds can achieve greater results. Accordingly, based on the resolution of the general assembly, we hereby request your review and implementation to fulfill the responsibilities of municipal authorities and establish an essential plan for sound municipal administration."</p>

<h3>Jiang Dingwen and Others Maintain Educational Undertakings in Their Hometown</h3>
<p>Fundraising Widely for Yizhong</p>
<p>Please Contribute Generously, Fellow Villagers</p>
<p>(Guomin News Agency) The Zhuji Yizhong Public School, founded by the late Kuomintang veteran and renowned figure from eastern Zhejiang, Mr. Wu Zhonghuai, was established during the late Qing Dynasty in the Guangxu reign. Cai Yuanpei, Ma Yichu, and others previously taught at the school. Therefore, over the past twenty years, numerous talented individuals have emerged, holding important positions in various Party, government, military, educational, and other sectors. Jiang Dingwen, Si Lie, Jiang Bocheng, Cai Guanluo, and Zhang Weiying are particularly prominent examples. Currently, the school has been affected by floods and rent reductions in recent years, resulting in a decrease in arable land and a shortage of annual income, causing significant economic difficulties. Therefore, Jiang Dingwen, Zhou Boxiong, and others have initiated a fundraising campaign to strengthen the foundation. Fundraising teams have been organized in Hangzhou, Shaoxing, Ningbo, Shanghai, Beijing, Shandong, Anhui, Tianjin, Henan, Beiping, Wuhan, Guangdong, and the local county, totaling thirteen teams. Each team has appointed a fundraising director responsible for soliciting donations. Chen Boxiu, a member of the Shanghai Special City Party Committee, has been appointed as the fundraising director for the Shanghai team. According to Chen, Shanghai's Zhuji fellow villagers have always been known for their public spirit and concern for education in their hometown. They will surely be happy to support this fundraising initiative and contribute generously to this great undertaking.</p>

<h3>Yu Binqi Initiates Women's Swimming Association</h3>
<p>Yu Binqi is a sports enthusiast, especially interested in swimming. In 1929, he and Mr. Ye of the Municipal Party Committee, Ms. Lu Lihua of the Liangjiang Women's Sports School, and others organized the China Swimming Research Association, which attracted more than 300 members. Their diligent research yielded remarkable results. Last year, at the Shanghai Municipal Games, Binqi was fortunate to win the first Shanghai Swimming Championship. From this, he realized that organized and methodical training is highly effective. The Second National Games are scheduled to be held in the capital on Double Ten Day, and all provinces and cities are preparing to participate. Shanghai has been working hard on track and field, ball games, and other events, and progress has been made. However, swimming, especially the women's swimming team, has rarely been promoted, and there has been no organization for training, which is regrettable. In view of this, Mr. Yu and his colleagues initiated the organization of the Shanghai Women's Swimming Association, taking on the responsibility of providing guidance and dividing the talent into teams for training. It is hoped that this will promote women's sports, arouse women's interest in swimming, and enable Shanghai women to shine in the sports world in the future. Ms. Guo Shaohui, Yan Kun, and Lou Jian of Guanghua University, Ms. Li Manli of Jinan University, Ms. Li Xiumin and Gao Guang of China Women's Sports School, Ms. Gao Manqian of Muir Church, Ms. Wu Wei, and others have already joined. Once a sufficient number of people have been recruited, a meeting will be held to establish the association. In the future, when the Public Works Department swimming pool is open, training will be implemented. It is hoped that enthusiastic women swimmers in the city will join as soon as possible for joint research. The registration address is temporarily set at the Chinese Typewriter Department of the China National Products United Department Store on Nanjing Road. Low Hurdles</p>

<h3>Huayang Steamer Accident</h3>
<p>Set Sail for Fujian the Day Before Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>Encountered Fog and Ran Aground Midway Yesterday</p>
<p>Local Authorities Received SOS Signal</p>
<p>Fairness Steamer Already Dispatched to Rescue</p>
<p>In the past two months, alarms of collisions, fires, groundings, and accidents involving ships in this port have been pouring in like snowflakes, truly a turbulent time for the shipping industry. Now, there is another accident involving the Huayang Steamer running aground in the fog. The results of the investigation are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Huayang History: The Huayang Steamer was originally owned by Liu Shisun of the Nanhua Company. Later, it was sold to Mr. Wang Boqun. Mr. Wang leased the ship to others for coastal routes. Last year, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (CMSNC) chartered the ship to sail to Dalian and Niuzhuang. At the end of the contract, Mr. Wang took it back and entrusted it to Mr. Ying, the principal of the Wusong Merchant Marine School, for management. He also formed the Zhiliang Company to manage the business of the Huayang. This year, the South City Navigation Safety Company chartered it to operate the Shanghai-Fuzhou-Xinghua-Quanzhou route, which was quite prosperous.</p>
<p>Encountering Fog on the Way to Fujian: The Huayang Steamer departed from Shanghai at 2:00 PM on the 20th, first heading to Fuzhou and then to Xinghua. There were more than 50 passengers on board bound for Fujian. There were also 1,000 tons of export goods loaded in Shanghai. The voyage felt calm when sailing out of the Wusongkou. However, the ship suddenly encountered dense fog obscuring the target when it reached the Wenzhou waters yesterday afternoon, causing it to mistakenly run aground on a reef, resulting in an accident.</p>
<p>Condition of Grounding: At 3:00 PM yesterday, the Huayang Steamer was near Ma'an Island in the Wenzhou waters, near the side of Sijiao Mountain, where the CMSNC's Xinchang Steamer had an accident, about 200 nautical miles from Wusongkou in Shanghai, at a place called Liyu Mountain Reef, known in Western terms as Heishan Saddles. The ship struck a submerged reef. It was heard that the bottom of the ship had been breached, and seawater immediately flooded into the various cabins. The ship gradually sank, and the situation was extremely critical.</p>
<p>Sending SOS: At 3:30 PM yesterday, the shipowner urgently sent a radio distress signal, SOS. The local coastal radio station received the signal and immediately notified the South City Navigation Safety Company and the Customs Patrol Service by telephone, urging them to quickly dispatch a ship for rescue. The CMSNC radio station also received the signal and notified the Navigation Safety Company to send help.</p>
<p>Fairness Arrives for Rescue: The CMSNC's Fairness Steamer was returning to Shanghai from Shantou and received the distress signal from the Huayang Steamer when it arrived in the Fuzhou waters. The shipowner of the Fairness Steamer immediately set sail for Ma'an Island in accordance with the maritime disaster rescue regulations to rescue the crew and passengers of the Huayang Steamer. There was also a foreign merchant ship near Ma'an Island that received the Huayang's SOS signal and had set sail for Heishan Saddles to assist the Fairness in the rescue.</p>
<p>Waiting for Fog to Clear: According to the Fairness Steamer's report to Shanghai, it was estimated that it could reach Liyu Mountain at 5:30 PM yesterday to rescue the Huayang Steamer and passengers. Later, the Fairness Steamer reported that it arrived at Ma'an Island at around 5:00 PM, but the sea was very foggy, and there were many hidden reefs, making it impossible to proceed. It had to drop anchor and wait for the fog to clear before proceeding for rescue. Currently, the Fairness Steamer is anchored about five nautical miles away from the Huayang Steamer, together with a foreign merchant ship. Once the fog clears, they will send lifeboats to the Huayang to transport the crew and others back to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Personnel Taking Refuge: The Huayang Steamer is a sea vessel with a deadweight of about 2,000 tons and a value of 100,000 yuan. It is reported that the bottom of the ship has been breached by reefs. It is currently unclear whether there have been any deaths among the crew and passengers. Those who have already left the ship are believed to have gone to small islands for shelter. All personnel will be rescued by the Fairness Steamer. More details are awaited in subsequent reports.</p>

<h3>Mr. Wang Yansong's Remarks</h3>
<p>A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency visited Mr. Wang Yansong, a standing committee member of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, yesterday after receiving news that he had been elected as a Shanghai representative to the National Assembly, and asked for his views on the election. According to Mr. Wang's statement to the reporter, he has been following the business community and striving to promote commerce, fearing its decline. This election to the National Assembly was due to the business community's erroneous selection of him to serve as a representative, which made him feel deeply apprehensive. He believes that the purpose of the National Assembly is to gather national representatives together to receive the Premier's instructions and decide on the national construction policy, which is of utmost importance. He himself feels that his talent and knowledge are superficial and does not dare to accept the election. However, on the other hand, he observes that attending as a representative is an obligation, not a right. Since the business community has instructed him to serve, he does not dare to rest idly. Fortunately, there are five representatives from this city, and there will be much benefit from mutual criticism and research. At the same time, the representatives of various industries in the business community should not fail to urge and instruct him so that he can live up to the trust placed in him. As for the proposals of the Shanghai business community for the National Assembly, they are still under discussion. In his opinion, there are two points that deserve the most attention: First, the abolition of unequal treaties. The Premier's will was to convene a National Assembly and abolish unequal treaties, which have been realized in the shortest period of time since the establishment of the National Government. Diplomatic work has been extremely diligent, and the recovery of tariff autonomy has been achieved. However, the abolition of consular jurisdiction and the recovery of concessions have not yet been fully achieved. Shanghai merchants and people feel the pain of consular jurisdiction and concessions most deeply. These points should be clearly and strongly expressed in the National Assembly as a backing for the government's diplomacy. Second, the issue of national livelihood. In recent years, commercial depression has reached its extreme, and the reason lies in the hardship of the national livelihood. If commerce is to prosper, the people must have purchasing power, and if the people are to have purchasing power, attention must first be paid to the maintenance of national livelihood. He deeply hopes that when the National Assembly discusses the constitution, special attention should be paid to the chapter on national livelihood so that the spirit of the Principle of People's Livelihood in the Three Principles of the People can be fully expressed.</p>

<p>The German warship Emden arrived in China for the first time on April 15 and sailed to Nanjing from the Philippines. On April 20, it departed for Shanghai and arrived at 10:00 AM yesterday, mooring at the No. 3 buoy in the Huangpu River. Dr. Walter Frentzel, the German Consul in Shanghai, and eight German businessmen in Shanghai boarded the ship to welcome it. At noon, the German Consul hosted a banquet for Captain Wittorf and other senior officers in the consulate. At 4:30 PM yesterday afternoon, Chinese and foreign reporters were received</p>

<p>More than twenty reporters from Chinese and foreign newspapers boarded the ship at the New Customs Wharf, taking a small motorboat specially released by the ship directly to the No. 3 buoy in the Huangpu River. After boarding the ship, they were received by Naval Major Tilly, the ship's news officer, who said that the Captain had just gone ashore for official business and was unable to rush to welcome them, and asked him to represent him in welcoming everyone. He then reported the history and internal details of the ship. According to him, there have been three German warships named Emden, and the current ship is the third one. It was launched on January 7, 1925, with a displacement of 6,000 tons, a length of 155 meters, a width of 14.3 meters, and a draft of 6.3 meters. The ship has 22 officers, 3 warrant officers, 15 junior officers, 120 senior non-commissioned officers, 314 soldiers, and 67 naval cadets. The ship is equipped with eight 150mm guns, two 88mm guns, two underwater mine tubes, and four training dinghies. It was also said that Captain Wittorf, a lieutenant colonel in the Navy, served as a mine officer on the former German warship Emden. Before the outbreak of World War I in 1914, the Emden participated in various battles in the Indian Ocean, and Mr. Wittorf also participated. Before the Battle of Cocos Island in 1915, the Emden was destroyed, and Mr. Wittorf was captured. He was released after the war and returned to Emden, which is a famous ancient city on the coast of northern Germany that was extremely prosperous hundreds of years ago. Naming the warship after it shows remembrance. The reporters were then led on a tour of the entire ship. Before long, the Captain also rushed to greet the crowd, saying that he was deeply grateful for the State Council's hospitality in Beijing, and that he was especially honored by everyone's presence today. This is the first time a German warship has visited China since the Great War. It plans to stay in Shanghai for six days and then set sail for Japan before returning home via the same route. At 5:30 PM, the reporters shook hands and said goodbye.</p>

<h3>National Goods Promotion to Southeast Asia Shows Great Promise</h3>
<p>Zhou Guojun Reports at a Welcome Reception</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Factories Joint Association held a general meeting yesterday to welcome Zhou Guojun, Ye Youcai, the leaders of the Southeast Asian Islands Inspection Group, and all members. More than eighty representatives from factories such as the China Enamel Factory, the Huasheng Electric Appliance Factory, the Scientific Instrument Museum, and the Golden Rooster Tie Company were in attendance. Chairman Lu Xingzhuang reported the purpose of the meeting. Sun Choucheng publicly read the Ministry of Industry's instruction urging the reporting of inspection results. Zhou Guojun stood up and reported, briefly stating that this trip to Southeast Asia had covered all ports except Rangoon and the Philippines. The circumstances of the trip will be presented in a written report, but due to the time constraints today, only a brief oral report can be given. The promotion of national goods to Southeast Asia shows great promise. The points requested by overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia are listed below: (1) It is hoped that domestic factories will send their national goods for display to facilitate recognition. (2) It is hoped that factories will open a mobile exhibition of national goods in Singapore to facilitate purchases. (3) It is hoped that the government will establish a commercial committee in Southeast Asia to focus on foreign trade. (4) It is hoped that factories will send personnel to reside permanently in Southeast Asia to facilitate liaison. In short, the patriotism of overseas Chinese and their love for national goods are well known. There are two key points that require urgent attention for the important work of promoting national goods: (1) The issue of foreign exchange remittance. Overseas Chinese propose that the National Goods Bank take on this responsibility. (2) Transportation is currently inconvenient. Overseas Chinese request that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company open a Sino-Southeast Asian route for direct cargo transport. Subsequently, Zhu Zhenhan, Ye Youcai, Gu Jiuru, and other gentlemen successively expressed their opinions and proposed promotion methods. The result was that this intention would be submitted to the Executive Supervisory Committee for detailed discussion before being implemented separately.</p>

<h3>Oath-Taking Ceremony for Members of the City Defense Corps</h3>
<p>All Corps Members Stand in the Rain</p>
<p>Future Work Will Focus on Training</p>
<p>The Management Committee of the City Defense Corps has been appointed by Mayor Zhang. Yesterday, the committee members held an oath-taking ceremony at the City Public Sports Ground at 3:00 PM. Sun Baorong, a counselor of the city government, Chen Xizeng, director of the City Public Security Bureau, Luo Jingyou, head of the Second Section of the city government, Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yansong, Ye Huijun, Yao Mulian, Wang Binyan, and Yu Hede, were in attendance. Except for Luo Jingyou and Yu Hede, who were absent due to other commitments, the other seven members attended the ceremony and took their oaths. More than two thousand officers and members of the City Defense Corps participated in the ceremony. They assembled at the Public Sports Ground at 9:00 AM, with Shi Fenglin, a trainer of the City Defense Corps, serving as the temporary commander. Mayor Zhang and others arrived at the venue at 3:00 PM, and the inauguration took place immediately. Ye Huijun, a member of the Management Committee, was publicly elected to preside over the ceremony. The oath was then taken, with Ye Huijun publicly elected to recite the oath on behalf of the members: "We swear with utmost sincerity to恪遵Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will, implement the Three Principles of the People, obey the orders of our superiors, defend the locality, and protect the people, so as not to betray the earnest intention of establishing the defense corps. If we violate this oath, we are willing to be subjected to the most severe punishment of our party. We solemnly swear." Mayor Zhang delivered a speech, generally stating that the Shanghai City Defense Corps has a long history and has made great contributions to maintaining local security and protecting the people during the warlord wars. However, in the past, due to the lack of a fully responsible command organization, funding, planning, and training were not unified. The city government felt the need for reorganization, so it established a reorganization committee. The members of the reorganization committee were all deeply involved in the history and relationship of the Defense Corps. After the reorganization was completed, the results were satisfactory, and the budget was not exceeded. Education and training were also well-organized. It can be said that the Shanghai City Defense Corps has been built on a very solid foundation, and popular martial affairs can be promoted and developed. However, although the reorganization has been completed, the reorganization committee members requested to be reorganized because their responsibilities had been fulfilled. However, the city government felt that the management methods for the Defense Corps in the future had not been thoroughly studied, and the central government had not promulgated regulations for the City Defense Corps. Therefore, after research by the city government, it was decided that a proper organization should be responsible for the management of future issues such as funding and education. Hence, the establishment of this Management Committee to command all members of the City Defense Corps. All candidates have a long history with the Shanghai City Defense Corps. We believe that the members will be able to gradually improve the Defense Corps during their tenure. In addition, there is a newly joined member, Director Chen of the Public Security Bureau. The Director of the Public Security Bureau was originally designated as a member of the committee because the police of the Public Security Bureau and the local Defense Corps are closely related. One is a government agency, and the other is a popular organization. Moreover, Shanghai's police force is very weak, and the assistance of the Defense Corps is sometimes necessary. In addition, Mr. Li Yingshi, who is deeply related to the Shanghai City Defense Corps, has also joined as a new member. However, due to his physical weakness and the fact that his area of residence is not within the scope of the city, he resolutely resigned. Mr. Li and I have been friends for many years and know his difficulties, so I granted his request. In addition, Luo Jingxian, the head of the Second Section of the city government, has also joined. Committee member Luo is the head of the Second Section of the city government, and all affairs of the City Defense Corps are managed by the Second Section. Therefore, Committee member Luo is also very familiar with the City Defense Corps. Moreover, Committee member Luo is a graduate of the Army University and will definitely make considerable contributions to the training of the Defense Corps in the future. All members are capable and pleasant and will make the City Defense Corps improve day by day. The safety of more than three million people in Shanghai will be fully guaranteed. At the same time, it is hoped that the members of the Defense Corps will work together to serve the public, and that the committee members will do their best to plan and implement all plans and contributions. The city government will also do its best to support them. Next, Director Chen Xizeng delivered a speech. Next, Xu Peihuang, Director of the City Education Bureau, delivered a speech on behalf of the guests. Finally, Sun Baorong, publicly elected as a representative of the Management Committee, delivered a reply, generally stating that the main points that can be reported in the past year are only a few: (1) Defining the organization. (2) Determining funding. (3) Stipulating the establishment. In addition, training has not yet been carried out. Now that this committee has been established and works with one heart and one mind, it will definitely be able to achieve the true meaning of these two words: "defense." At the same time, the members of the corps in each district must also understand that the Defense Corps is to serve the public and to implement the responsibility of assisting the military and police in arresting bandits. Members must not be afraid of difficulties or lazy, and must train diligently. The meeting adjourned at 4:00 PM.</p>
<h3>No Farming Allowed in Newly Designated County Seat Land</h3>
<p>Payment to Be Given Within a Deadline, Construction to Commence</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government issued a notice yesterday stating that, according to the petition submitted by Wu Wenhua, a member and chairman of the Relocation Design Committee, the fourth meeting of the committee resolved to appoint Committee Member Wang Li, Committee Member Wu Wenhua, and Committee Member Yang Fulin to be responsible for the acquisition of land. Committee Member Wang Li and others stated that they had visited the site on the eleventh of this month to jointly demarcate the area and erect wooden stakes. Therefore, it is earnestly requested that the magistrate be permitted to issue a notice prohibiting the villagers in the demarcated land from farming in order to facilitate the proceedings for the public good. In addition to instructions, this notice is hereby issued to inform all landowners and tenant farmers in the demarcated land that the site for the new county seat has been surveyed and demarcated for acquisition. Payment will be given and construction will commence within a deadline. No further farming is allowed on the land to avoid losses. All should comply and not violate this notice.</p>
<h3>Refund Approved for Excess Tariff on Yarn and Cloth</h3>
<p>The Chinese Cotton Mill Association Has Received a Reply from the Consolidated Tax Bureau. The Shanghai Chinese Cotton Mill Association previously reported that the customs authorities were imposing heavy tariffs on machine-made foreign goods on yarn and cloth in areas where the consolidated tax had not been implemented. Merchants feared that the sudden increase in the double burden would lead to a complete halt in the transport and sale of yarn and cloth, and that the resulting losses would be too great. The association submitted a proposal to the Consolidated Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance requesting relief. It is now learned that the association has received a reply from the Consolidated Tax Bureau approving the request. Therefore, it has been notified to the various mills yesterday for compliance. The original letter reads: "We previously requested the Consolidated Tax Bureau to provide relief for the customs duties levied on cotton yarn and its direct woven products transported to areas where the Consolidated Tax Bureau has not been implemented. Now we have received a letter from the Consolidated Tax Bureau dated April 18, stating that, since merchants believe that the customs duties levied on cotton yarn and its direct woven products transported to areas where the Consolidated Tax Bureau has not been implemented are an increased burden, they should be handled as proposed in your letter. Each factory is allowed to submit the receipts for the customs duties paid to the Bureau before the 25th of each month, and the Bureau will first refund the amount of the original consolidated tax paid (issuing a tax refund certificate to offset taxes at the end of the month) to show special accommodation. The remaining consolidated tax will be fully refunded after the goods arrive at their destination and the evidence from the local collection agency is submitted to the Bureau. This letter is in reply and we hope you will inform the various cotton mills for compliance."</p>
<h3>Exemption of Tariff on Native Cloth Is Expected</h3>
<p>Representatives of the Three Trade Associations Go to Customs to Request Exemption</p>
<p>The Customs Consolidated Tax Bureau Has Granted Oral Approval</p>
<p>More than seventy native cloth companies in Shanghai send native cloth to the Northeast. Because native cloth is made of cotton yarn, and cotton yarn is subject to the consolidated tax, the customs duties that were previously payable to the customs authorities should be waived in accordance with the principle of one tax per item promulgated by the Ministry of Finance. The authorities are requested to waive the duties immediately, taking into account the merchants' difficulties and benefiting the transport of goods. It is reported that representatives from the Native Cloth Association, the Yarn and Cloth Association, and the Cotton Textile and Dyeing Association went to the Jianghai Customs Consolidated Tax Bureau with a letter on the 20th to meet with the director of the bureau. The main points of the report stated that the native cloth industry is currently in a state of depression, with declining business. Moreover, Japanese cloth has been selling well in the northeastern provinces for several years, encroaching on transactions. The amount of domestic native cloth sold is decreasing year by year. Northeastern merchants prefer to trade in large quantities because Japanese cloth is cheaper, while domestic products are being phased out. Each native cloth company exporting to the Northeast has a tax exemption permit issued by the Consolidated Tax Bureau for the entire route. It is requested that your Bureau, in accordance with the principle of one tax per item formulated by the Ministry of Finance and the purpose of the Ministry of Finance in establishing taxes, immediately suspend the collection of taxes on native cloth, so that the burden on cloth merchants can be slightly reduced and the price of cloth can be slightly cheaper. The amount of cloth exported will definitely increase from now on, and it will not be too late to recover the lost revenue. The Director of the Customs Consolidated Tax Bureau replied to the representatives of the three associations that customs officers continuing to collect taxes on the export of native cloth was a misunderstanding. He orally granted the native cloth companies permission to transport native cloth to the Northeast without paying the usual taxes. The native cloth companies are now awaiting the official announcement from the customs authorities and the arrival of the instructions from the Ministry of Finance before resuming the export of goods.</p>
<h3>Preparation Office for City Business Tax Invites Representatives from the Chamber of Commerce to Participate in Discussions</h3>
<p>Collecting Opinions from Various Trade Associations</p>
<p>The regulations and implementation rules for the city business tax, as well as the tax standard and tax rate schedule, have been drafted by the Business Tax Preparation Office under the direction of the former director of the City Finance Bureau, Tang. It is reported that representatives from the Chamber of Commerce will be invited to participate in the discussions on a regular basis. The preparation office has issued a notice to the various trade associations that if they have any opinions, they may submit them to the representatives of the Chamber of Commerce for compilation and transfer, or send them directly to the office within two weeks for research, so as to benefit both tax revenue and commercial information.</p>
<h3>Various Industries Request Revision or Exemption from Business Tax</h3>
<p>Pen and Ink Industry: The Pen and Ink Industry Association sent a letter to the City Chamber of Commerce on April 18, stating: "Our association's ink industry originally used domestic tobacco to make ink. The quality was fine and the selling price was high. Every 100 kilograms of exported goods was valued at 80 taels, and the tax was 4 taels at a rate of 5%. Later, the source of domestic tobacco gradually dried up, and all raw materials had to be supplied by imported goods. The quality was inferior and the selling price decreased, even falling to around 40 taels. However, the customs duty levied remains the same, which is actually more than doubled invisibly compared to the past. We previously requested your association to forward the request to the Ministry of Finance for tax exemption, and we received the approval that 'the current tax rules are not without excessive weight, and it should be investigated and adjusted to make it appropriate.' Now the Ministry of Finance proposes to revise the export tax rate, and even insists that the tax rate remain the same for ad valorem taxes. The intention is nothing more than that the state's tax revenue has no losses to speak of because the ad valorem taxes have increased with the market price. However, it is not known that the ink industry's selling price has decreased due to the quality of the raw materials. The situation is special and cannot be understood by others. If we do not request to revise it based on the selling price, the depth of the pain will be immeasurable. Moreover, the amount of goods exported by the ink industry each year is very low. Even if taxes are levied based on the selling price, it will not have a great impact on the state's tax revenue, but it can relieve the difficulties in the ink industry's business operations. We have always admired your association's leadership in gathering merchants from all walks of life, and we earnestly request that you forward the request to the Ministry of Finance for approval to revise it, which would be a great benefit."</p>
<p>Advertising Industry: The Advertising Industry Association recently stated that various advertisements operated by the industry must be taxed. Although the National Government has abolished various miscellaneous taxes, local government offices still collect them. Now that the business tax is being implemented, this advertising tax should be abolished immediately. It is reported that a letter has been sent to the Tax Rules Research Committee of the City Chamber of Commerce on the one hand, and an appeal has been made to the authorities to abolish this tax on the other.</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Explains the Scope of Applying for Business License</h3>
<p>Companies Registered with the Central Government Are All Exempt</p>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce, in response to a letter from the Sanyou Industrial Society requesting clarification on various doubts regarding applying for a business license, replied as follows: "(1) Companies that pay income tax to the central government and those that are subject to special taxes collected by the central government do not need to obtain a business license in accordance with Article 1 of the General Outline for the Collection of Business Tax in various provinces. The original regulations are very clear. (2) The nature of the company registration license is equivalent to the business license issued by the central government. The effect of this license naturally covers all branches of the company. According to Article 1 of the General Outline, regardless of whether it is a head office or a branch, it is directly obligated to pay taxes to the central government and is considered that this company does not belong to the local government's tax administration system. Article 1 of the General Outline does not have any exceptions for head offices and branches, and it should be interpreted as being exempt from paying for business licenses."</p>

<h3>The Customs Brokerage Strike Is About to Be Resolved</h3>
<p>Cotton Cloth Cartage Fees Will Still Be Borne by Merchants</p>
<p>Work Can Be Resumed After Approval by the Two Associations Today</p>
<p>The strike by customs brokerage workers in the city has continued to this day, and cotton cloth and foreign goods from the factory have not yet been shipped. Yesterday, the Social Bureau convened another meeting to mediate. The cotton cloth cartage fees will still be handled in accordance with the notice issued by the authorities. The cartage fee rates have been negotiated independently, and a draft agreement has been drawn up for the shipping routes. However, work can be resumed only after it is approved by the Customs Brokerage Association and the Customs Brokerage Workers Association at today's general meeting. The various circumstances and the authorities' statements are recorded below.</p>
<p>Mediation Meeting: The Social Bureau convened a mediation meeting again yesterday at 10:00 AM regarding the suspension of cotton cloth and foreign goods from the factory. Ren Jinxiang and Su Houxin, representatives of the Customs Brokerage Workers Association, Shi Zikun, a representative of the Customs Brokerage Association, and Chen Songyuan, Deng Zhonghe, Shi Jiucheng, and He Ganchen, representatives of the Cotton Cloth Association, attended the meeting. Chairman Guo Yongxi first reported the handling of the notice issued by the authorities, which was beneficial to all parties. After a detailed explanation, the representatives of the Cotton Cloth Association and the Customs Brokerage Association agreed to comply with the notice issued by the authorities regarding the cotton cloth cartage fees. As for the issue of the shipping routes for foreign goods, the chairman instructed them to negotiate independently outside the meeting. If a settlement could not be reached, they would submit a request for legal processing.</p>
<p>General Meeting: The Cotton Cloth Association held a general meeting yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM. One hundred and seventy-nine companies, including Rixin Zeng, Su Xinyi, Jinfeng, and Yuan Maosheng, attended the meeting. Chairman Chen Songyuan first reported the purpose of the meeting and the progress of the negotiations with the Customs Brokerage Association. Then, discussions began and it was resolved that (1) the conditions proposed by the Customs Brokerage Association were approved in principle, but the wording still needed to be slightly revised. The third item, "No shipping further south," should be deleted because the cartage fee for the Taichu warehouse in that area has always been paid by the factory. (2) Yu Wenlan and Wang Shengyuan were added as representatives to revise the conditions. (3) If the workers still do not agree to the above conditions, the industry must insist on rejecting the cartage fee and set up its own customs brokerage firm as a fallback. (4) In accordance with the instructions of the Social Bureau, all merchants should collect an additional 3.4 cents of silver from the customers in addition to the price of the goods.</p>
<p>Negotiation Situation: Representatives of the Customs Brokerage Association, the Customs Brokerage Workers Association, and the Cotton Cloth Association borrowed the shipping declaration office in Jiangxi Road after being instructed by the Social Bureau to negotiate the cotton cloth cartage fee and shipping route case. You Senting and Shi Zikun of the Customs Brokerage Association, Chen Songyuan of the Cotton Cloth Association, and Ren Jinxiang and Su Yuanxin of the Customs Brokerage Workers Association negotiated a settlement for a long time and finalized the cotton cloth cartage fee schedule. Although a draft agreement has been drawn up for the cotton cloth shipping route, each must return to consult with each other before formally signing it through the Social Bureau.</p>
<p>Setting Cartage Fee: The cartage fees for cotton cloth shipped from the factory have been resolved through negotiations between representatives of the Cotton Cloth Association and the Customs Brokerage Workers Association as follows: Yihe coarse cloth 15 cents, coarse diagonal triangle Hengfeng Xiang cloth 20 cents, Yangshupu coarse cloth 20 cents, coarse diagonal four angles three Tai coarse cloth 20 cents, fine diagonal four angles Tongxing sugar diagonal four angles, fine cloth four angles, Gongda fine cloth four angles, fine diagonal four angles, Yongan coarse cloth 24 cents, fine diagonal four angles and eight cents, Shenxin coarse cloth 20 cents, internal and external coarse cloth 20 cents, fine cloth four angles, Public Benefit fine cloth 20 cents, Dalai coarse cloth 20 cents, Toyota coarse cloth 24 cents, fine cloth four angles, Zhenzhou fine cloth 30 cents. If there is no cartage fee, it will be handled as before.</p>
<p>Draft Route Agreement: Yesterday, the Customs Brokerage Association, the Customs Brokerage Workers Association, and the Cotton Cloth Association negotiated the draft of the cotton cloth shipping route. (1) The cotton cloth cartage fee along the Suzhou River is 29 cents for a double package and 15 cents for a single package. The warehouse fee is deducted by 200 points for a double package and 100 points for a single package. The Sichuan-Hankou and Second B幫 do not deduct the warehouse fee, and the lower labor is not responsible. (2) Piece goods from Yangjingbang to　山码头 (Sanshan Dock) do not give cartage fees. For warehouses in Osaka and Huangpu, the cartage fee is 20 cents per piece. The remaining cartage fees are supplemented by customs brokerage firms. The southernmost point is Ning Shao Lao Zhan and Dada Zhan. No shipping beyond that. (3) For each piece of goods from the warehouses along the Suzhou River and across Lihe Zhan, the cartage fee is 15 cents. The goods are delivered to the warehouse door and are not responsible. The cotton cloth warehouse cartage fees are handled as before. The goods from the store are shipped as usual, but must be passed by the Customs Brokerage Association and the Customs 上会 and be approved and amended.</p>
<p>Authorities' Statement: A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency met with Guo Yongxi, the staff member of the Social Bureau who is handling the case, and asked about the situation of the customs brokerage workers' strike. According to him, the customs brokerage workers went on strike because the Cotton Cloth Association published a statement in the newspaper stating that the cartage fees would be borne by the customers. After repeated inquiries from all parties, it was believed that the customs brokerage workers' strike was harmful to transportation. Therefore, the Bureau weighed the matter and issued a notice to the merchants that, in addition to paying the consolidated tax, fine cloth would still pay a cartage fee of 3.4 cents of silver. At the same time, the Cotton Cloth Association was instructed to inform all the companies in the industry to collect an additional 3.4 cents of cartage fee from the customers in addition to the price of the goods and distribute it to the workers as cartage fees for transporting the goods. After the announcement and instructions were issued, the merchants and the cotton cloth industry considered them appropriate and fully complied with them. Therefore, there were no problems with the case, and work could be resumed immediately. However, the Cotton Cloth Association raised the issue of the distance of transporting foreign goods with the Customs Brokerage Association, which led to disputes. The Bureau requested a mediation. The Bureau believed that this issue was an unnecessary complication, so it first instructed the Customs Brokerage Association, the Cotton Cloth Association, and the Customs Brokerage Workers Association to consult with each other first. If there were no results, it would be submitted as a separate case for the Bureau to mediate. However, last night's report did not mention that the Bureau convened a meeting with all parties to ask questions.</p>
<p>This may be a mistake.</p>

<h3>Continued News on Labor-Management Issues in the Western Restaurant Industry</h3>
<p>Social Affairs Bureau Interrogates Yesterday</p>
<p>This newspaper reported yesterday that five workers in the city's Western restaurant industry were dismissed by the management for organizing a labor union, leading to a labor-management dispute. It has been learned that regarding the dismissal of workers, the Social Affairs Bureau summoned both labor and management to the bureau for questioning yesterday (the 21st) at 10:00 AM. At 10:00 AM, the City Social Affairs Bureau summoned Chen Lianfu, the manager of Jinlong, representing the management, and Gu Youqing and Lai Shengquan, the dismissed workers, representing the labor side, to the bureau's First Mediation Office for questioning. Zhang Shuye from the Social Affairs Bureau presided over the interrogation. He first asked Gu Youqing, representing the labor side, how many years he had worked at Jinlong, why he was dismissed this time, and how much his monthly salary and tips were. Gu replied that he had been working there since Jinlong opened and was dismissed this time because he joined the labor union. His monthly salary was only four yuan, and the average monthly tips were only about ten yuan. Then, he asked Chen Lianfu whether he was the manager of Jinlong. Chen replied yes. He asked him why he dismissed Gu, Lai, and other workers. Chen replied that they were lazy and that the company's business had been slow recently, so they were laid off. He was then asked whether Gu and others had committed any faults in the past. Chen did not answer. Zhang then showed him the labor-management dismissal regulations and asked if he was aware of them. Chen replied that he was not. After questioning both parties, Zhang asked Chen to follow the dismissal regulations and not dismiss workers without reason. He proposed that the two dismissed workers be reinstated to avoid disputes, as per the bureau's mediation. Chen Lianfu, representing the management, did not agree and said he would consider it. Zhang then told the labor side to await the bureau's instructions. Thus, both parties left.</p>

<h3>Business Community's Custom Regarding Liability for Exchanging Banknotes</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce replied to the Silk and Satin Trade Association yesterday, saying: "Regarding the inquiry about disputes over the right of recourse for banknotes, and the request for an interpretation of current customs, as this matter concerns the customary practices of banknotes in this city, it should be based on inquiries with the city's banking industry. After separate letters were sent, a letter was received from the Bankers' Association, stating that according to the customary practice of our industry, if a client uses a check issued by another person or company, or a check drawn on another bank, to pay a bank, and the check is stamped with the words 'Exchange for bank's own note,' the bank should exchange it for its own note on behalf of the client. If the exchange cannot be made, the original check should be returned to the client. If the exchange is made but the note cannot be cashed when it matures, the exchanged note should still be returned to the client for exchange. The bank is not responsible for anything. The notation 'Exchange for bank's own note' indicates that the client has entrusted the bank to make the exchange on their behalf. The exchanged note is the same as if the client had directly given the bank a note from another bank. Therefore, if it cannot be cashed when it matures, it should still be returned to the original party." The letter was received earlier, so it is being replied to accordingly for your information.</p>

<h3>Retrial of the Dalun Case</h3>
<p>Wang Youling Proposes Four Levels and Four Trials</p>
<p>Judges Briefly Discuss</p>
<p>Preliminary Hearing to Seek Interpretation</p>
<p>Gao Shuo Summons Tenants for Questioning</p>
<p>The Dalun Real Estate Company leased the land at the corner of Nanjing Road and Fujian Road, Zhifu Lane, to the Great China Company to build a commercial center two years ago. Because the existing tenants, seventeen households including Lao Dafang, were unwilling to move, Dalun sued the tenants in the former Provisional Court, which ordered them to move. The tenants appealed to the previous Appellate Court, which overturned the original judgment. Dalun then appealed to the Supreme Court. In early spring, the Supreme Court ruled to send the case back to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court for a retrial. The continuous lawsuits have prevented the Great China Company from starting construction. Although it has purchased the land from Dalun, it is still subject to legal restrictions due to the ongoing litigation, and the handover is indefinite. Yesterday afternoon, the Higher Court's Second Branch held a hearing. Judge Ye Zaichou, assessor Li Mo, Gao Junxiang, and clerk Qian Qizhong presided. Qin Liankui and Li Zuyu, the lawyers representing the landlord, and Wang Youling, the lawyer representing the tenants, were present. Many people attended to observe. First, lawyer Wang raised the issue of jurisdiction and requested a preliminary ruling, saying that the issue was very important. He then elaborately stated his argument, roughly saying that the case was a relocation case, and according to Article 2, Paragraph 2 of the Civil Procedure Law, relocation cases fall under the jurisdiction of the primary court. During the Provisional Court era, the appellate body for primary cases in the second instance was the Appellate Court, and the appellate body for the third instance was initially undetermined. After the reorganization of the court, upon request for interpretation from the Judicial Yuan, the Judicial Yuan's Order No. 160 stated that for primary cases judged by the former Appellate Court, the final appellate body is now the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court. However, this case was appealed to the Supreme Court, which constitutes four levels and four trials, which does not conform to the current four levels and three trials. Changing a primary case to a local case is not in accordance with the legal system. Any judgment that does not follow the legal system, even if finalized, can still be requested for a retrial to correct the error. Moreover, this case has not yet been finalized, so this error must be corrected urgently. This is purely a legal issue. If this is not resolved first, nothing can proceed. Then, lawyers Qin and Li responded point by point, saying that in the first instance, the plaintiff recognized that it was a local case. Thereafter, from the first instance to the third instance, it was handled as a local case. Now, the interpretation of the Judicial Yuan cannot be used to overturn the judgment of the Supreme Court. Even if the previous procedures were incorrect, there is no way to remedy it now. One can only let it be wrong to the end. Moreover, the judges in the previous trials all investigated and determined that it was a local case based on their authority. Now, the other party suddenly has this claim, which is nothing more than a pretext to delay. It must be known that this case is not a retrial now, but a retrial sent back by the Supreme Court. The court can only retry the main text of the Supreme Court's judgment and cannot overturn the judgment of the Supreme Court. The presiding judge then announced a temporary recess for deliberation. After about a quarter of an hour, he reappeared and announced the court's intention, saying that if it is deemed necessary to request an interpretation of the issue, a request will be submitted to the superior authority. The trial will continue, and both parties are ordered to present evidence. The landlord's lawyer immediately declared that all evidence would be submitted with numbering. The tenant's lawyer stated that today's intention was to resolve the jurisdiction issue, so all evidence was not brought to court. The presiding judge's announcement of the court's intention was very appropriate, but it is strongly hoped that the ruling on the jurisdiction issue must be decided before the oral argument of the case, and the presentation of evidence should also be submitted as soon as possible in accordance with the instructions. The presiding judge then announced the adjournment of the court for further hearing. When the court was in session, Gao Shuo, a former lawyer and member of the Bar Association who had just been appointed as an advisor to the Supervisory Yuan, also attended the hearing. After the judges adjourned the court, Gao summoned the tenants in the case to the reception room of the Higher Court for questioning. After the tenants elected five representatives to enter the room, Gao asked them one by one about the details of the case, and then bid farewell to Director Xu and left the court.</p>
<h3>Jin Anxiang Kidnapped</h3>
<p>Going to Invite a Doctor Due to Mother's Illness</p>
<p>Suddenly Kidnapped by Bandits While Boarding the Car</p>
<p>Jin Runxiang, the manager of Minfeng Paper Company at No. 29 Bowuyuan Road, a Ningbo native, lives at No. 24 Renheli, Baike Road. His younger brother, Anxiang, is 32 years old and works as an accountant in the Minfeng Company. He lives with his mother and Runxiang's second concubine at No. 31 Mendelan Road. He goes to the company every morning at 9:00 AM and returns in the evening. Because his income is limited, he usually takes the tram. His elder brother, Jin Runxiang, owns car No. 2436 for transportation. The driver's name is Lu Ajin, from Tongzhou. Runxiang stayed at the second concubine's residence the night before, so he instructed Ajin to park the car in front of No. 29 Mendelan Road yesterday morning so that he could drive to the company in the morning. Unexpectedly, Runxiang's mother suddenly had a severe stomachache yesterday morning. At 9:15, Anxiang took car No. 2436 to No. 27 Renheli, Baike Road, to invite Dr. Song Bojin for a consultation. After picking up Dr. Song, they were about to board the car to go to Mendelan Road. However, when the driver Lu Ajin was about to start the engine, four bandits suddenly blocked the car with guns and jumped into the car. They drove the driver to the side and one of the bandits drove the car via Baike Road, Xizang Road, Baoshan Road, and Jiangwan Road. Near the racecourse, the bandits pushed the driver Lu Ajin and Dr. Song Boying out of the car and drove away with the hostage Jin Anxiang eastward. The driver and doctor reported to the Public Security Bureau and the patrol room, requesting an arrest. However, the car has not yet been found. It is speculated that the bandits intended to kidnap Anxiang's elder brother Runxiang, but made a mistake, or there was a misunderstanding.</p>
<h3>Liu Tongyun Case: Kidnapper Sentenced to Death</h3>
<p>Liu Tongyun, the owner of Fugi Paper Shop at No. 46 Chunjangli, Aiduya Road, was about to board his own car No. 6233 at 8:45 PM on September 19th of last year when several kidnappers suddenly swarmed forward, fired a shot to demonstrate, and then abducted Liu and escaped. His family paid a ransom of 20,000 yuan. Shao Jingfan, a Chinese detective from the Gordon Road patrol room, arrested the suspect, Miao Liucheng (age 25) from Yancheng. It was confirmed that the defendant Miao Liucheng was indeed the principal offender in the kidnapping of Liu and received 300 yuan afterward. Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer from the patrol room, filed a public prosecution. The Special District Local Court held several hearings and concluded the case. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Ge Zhiqin, the presiding judge, announced the verdict: the defendant Miao Liucheng was sentenced to death for the crime of jointly kidnapping and extorting ransom, and deprived of his civil rights indefinitely.</p>
<h3>Protest in the Shen Yun Jie Case</h3>
<p>If the Patrol Room Does Not Prosecute</p>
<p>Shen Jiting Will Sue</p>
<p>Regarding the case of Shen Yun Jie, a member of the Special Police Chinese Regiment, who was mistakenly shot and killed by a patrol officer who mistook him for a bandit, the deceased's father, Shen Jiting, has entrusted lawyers Yang Linzhi and Zhang Jiahui to first send a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers Association to negotiate with the Municipal Council to urge the patrol room to investigate and prosecute. Otherwise, the party concerned will file a lawsuit in the Special District Local Court. Yesterday, lawyers Yang and Zhang sent a letter to the Shanghai Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association, saying: "We are writing to you on behalf of Shen Jiting, who claims that his son, Yun Jie, is currently a member of the Public Concession Special Police Chinese Regiment. On April 15th, at 8:45 PM, he was on duty at the Laozha Patrol Room and left work at 10:00 PM. On his way home from the patrol room, he passed Nanjing Road when patrol officers were pursuing bandits and fighting. His son was mistakenly shot and killed by the patrol. The Chinese Police Regiment has certified that it is true, and Prosecutor Guo of the Special District Local Court has examined the body and confirmed that Shen Yun Jie was killed by a gunshot during the fight with the bandits. The plainclothes patrol officer who fired the shot stated that he heard that Wang Yongqin's shoe store on Xinzha Road had been robbed, so he followed the bandits from Xinzha Road to the opposite side of the New World, where he joined the officers and shot at the bandits. The plainclothes patrol officer followed the bandits for a long distance and for a long time. He should have clearly recognized the clothing and appearance of the bandits. How could he have mistakenly shot and killed my son? After realizing the mistake, he instructed the employees of Wang Yongtai's store to identify my son as a bandit in an attempt to shirk responsibility. As a public official, he is so cruel and unreasonable. Moreover, the patrol officers shot my son more than ten times. At that time, my son was already lying on the ground after being shot once. Even if he was a bandit, he had no ability to resist. He could have been captured safely. Why did the patrol officers fire more than ten shots in a row after my son fell to the ground, causing my son to be covered in gunshot wounds and blood? How could such an inhumane thing happen in broad daylight? The patrol officers neglected their duties beforehand, brutally killed innocent people during the incident, and dared to fabricate facts afterward in an attempt to escape punishment. This is extremely illegal. Moreover, Nanjing Road is the center of the bustling city with many pedestrians. How dare the patrol officers disregard human lives and indiscriminately shoot, causing the innocent to be brutally killed and the culprits to escape? Such neglect of duty, disregard for human lives, inhumanity, and harm to the public is causing the deceased to die unjustly and the living to appeal in vain. The Special Chinese Police Regiment was established through the efforts of the Chinese Ratepayers Association. My son, Yun Jie, is a member of the regiment. We request your lawyer to send a letter to the Municipal Council to lodge a serious protest and severely punish the plainclothes officer who falsely accused a good person of being a bandit and brutally killed an innocent person in accordance with the law. We also ask you to protect the spirit of the public interest."</p>
<h3>Lu Lixia Regrets Losing Her Footing</h3>
<p>Lan Wenlin Accused of Fraudulently Seducing</p>
<p>Lu Jiyun's Resentment is Clear in His Words</p>
<p>Lu Jiyun, residing at No. 1 Fumeili, Ben Cheng County, has, together with his daughter Lu Lixia, recently hired lawyer Lu Qi to draft a complaint to the prosecutor's office of the local court, accusing Lan Wenlin, a Guangdong native, of fraudulently seducing a girl under the age of sixteen, causing her to be poisoned, and of instigating the deception of others' property with the intention of absconding, requesting legal action and the recovery of the deceived jewelry, with the following private prosecution:</p>
<p>The plaintiff, during the winter of the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, was harmed by others due to business disputes and detained in the concession patrol room for a long period. It was inevitable that the family's livelihood would be lacking a person to manage it.</p>
<p>The eldest daughter, Lixia, had just graduated from school (age sixteen) and was forced to seek a position as a female staff member at the local National Goods Bank to help with the family's finances. This was unavoidable and a last resort. Unexpectedly, the defendant Lan Wenlin, a colleague at the bank, took a liking to her at first sight and began to court her. Initially, he only invited her to dinners and plays, then lured her to dancing and movies, and eventually, he took her for car rides and</p>
<p>Forcibly embraced her, arousing his bestial lust. In the winter of that year, he lured Lixia into the Juelu Hotel, locked the door, and threatened her, engaging in unrestrained adultery. Lixia, being of weak constitution, could not resist, and a young girl was subjected to abuse. Even more hateful is that after her body was defiled, she was also infected with a venereal disease, nearly leading to unforeseen consequences. She was bedridden for a while and diagnosed as not only having her innocence tarnished but also being</p>
<p>Sterile for life. Lixia was young and did not initially</p>
<p>Students' happiness was cut short from then on. She also hid her head and covered her tail, hoping to conceal her shame. Therefore, few people in the family initially knew about it. Unexpectedly, the defendant became even more reckless, taking an inch after gaining a foot. Since the relationship was already established, resentment was futile. It would be better to stay together for life and make do to preserve oneself. Lixia was not intelligent and found it difficult to get rid of him. She could not speak out and had no face to listen to his bewitchment, so she blindly followed him. Moreover, the defendant claimed to have graduated from a university and worked for a certain organization, exaggerating his claims to make it easy for people to listen. In addition,</p>
<p>He was skilled in flattery, using sweet words to make Lixia listen to his instigation to borrow gold and jewelry from her classmates, and he also stole valuable jade rings and clothes from the plaintiff's house and gave them to the defendant, intending to elope. At that time, the plaintiff was imprisoned and unable to control himself, let alone think about it. Therefore, the defendant was able to calmly implement his plans,</p>
<p>Continuing to seduce her, saying that he would hire a matchmaker to propose marriage soon, and that he would get the approval of her parents. Fearing that the plaintiff would return home and discover the truth, the defendant exchanged wedding vows with Lixia and took photos together to control her. In reality, the defendant</p>
<p>was a libertine who had no concept of marriage. His constant talk of engagement was nothing more than a pretext to satisfy his lust. Lixia naively hoped to marry him for life, but she would be abandoned in the end and unable to extricate herself. Moreover, he was not only defiling her, but also had further cunning plans. The defendant was inherently evil, cunning, and had a habit of committing crimes and illegal acts as a daily routine.</p>
<p>His actions were secretive and erratic, and he was willing to engage in unlawful and undisciplined behavior. He forged school seals, forged diplomas, impersonated relatives, and defrauded money. The number of people in society harmed by him is unknown. The plaintiff could not bear to see his weak daughter deceived and his humanity destroyed, so he was willing to expose the crime and engage in a legal battle with him. Therefore, he pleads with the court to uphold the spirit of justice, immediately arrest the defendant (the defendant is currently serving a prison sentence for fraud and is about to be released. If he is released, there will be no way to summon him), investigate and interrogate him, and initiate a public prosecution in accordance with Articles 244, 249, and 363 of the Criminal Code to punish him severely as a warning to those who harm</p>
<p>He destroys morals, injures humanity, and victimizes others. The victim, the plaintiff's eldest daughter Lixia, was defiled and poisoned. It is requested that she be examined in advance to prevent the defendant from denying it. The hearing has been ordered after receiving the order.</p>
<h3>Unemployed Youth Drowns in Pudong</h3>
<p>Having Eaten Up All Possessions and Having Nowhere to Go</p>
<p>Forced to Take This Last Resort</p>
<p>The day before yesterday evening, a young man boarded ferry No. 3 from the Hankou Road New Customs Wharf to Pudong. Not far from the shore, the young man suddenly took advantage of the lack of preparation and jumped into the river to commit suicide. Zhang Adai, an experienced boatman, tried his best to rescue him. Because he had inhaled a lot of water, he had already fainted. He was sent to the water patrol room and revived. He was later identified as Zhan Deshun, a native of Shaoxing, 19 years old. He worked at the Minghua Mirror Factory. He had introduced a friend to work at the factory, but when items were stolen from the factory, the factory manager suspected my friend and laid off both of us. We have been unemployed for many days, and after we ate up everything and there was truly no way to go, we had no choice but to take this last resort. The officer asked if Zhan had any relatives or friends in Shanghai. Zhan said that his friend Chen Qingyuan worked at the Xiefengchang Department Store at the Dongxinqiao Gongguan Road in the French Concession. The officer sent someone to bring Chen to the patrol room to take Zhan back and provide relief.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Adds Low-Income Housing</h3>

<h3>Petition from Rickshaw Pullers in West Shanghai</h3>
<p>Requesting Additional Licenses and Offering Suggestions for Regulation</p>
<p>Sun Zhaokang, Li Zhiliang, Zhu Qingyun, Zhang A'er, Qin Jiangzhou, and about twenty other representatives of the more than four hundred rickshaw pullers in West Shanghai, submitted a petition to the Public Utilities Bureau yesterday. The petition states: "We are mostly poor farmers from Jiangbei who, due to natural disasters and man-made calamities, have no land to cultivate and no home to return to. Therefore, we bring our elderly and children to Shanghai to seek a livelihood. Shanghai is a place of industry and commerce, and we are naturally subject to elimination, enduring hunger and sighing with longing for a home. Fortunately, with the help of relatives and friends, we have acquired rickshaws in the Zhoujiaqiao and Caojiadu areas of West Shanghai to eke out a living. This area is close to foreign-built roads that extend beyond the concession, allowing us to operate freely without licenses or permits, pulling our own rickshaws and making our own living, unaffected by wind, rain, cold, or heat. As a result, the number of rickshaw pullers has steadily increased, and people from all walks of life, both good and bad, are intermingled. We have jointly petitioned your bureau to issue licenses and regulate the industry to distinguish between them, and we have received your instructions that the North-South Rickshaw Merchants Association's guaranteed donation will expire on March 31 of this year, after which we should submit another petition. On the 11th of this month, we carefully read the rickshaw regulations jointly announced by your bureau and the Finance Bureau. The registration and inspection procedures are extremely strict, preventing unscrupulous merchants from deceiving the system and leaving a surplus for poor laborers. We belong to the latter category and dare not presume too much. However, the rickshaws we currently rely on for survival are all淘汰 from rickshaw companies or purchased from old goods stalls as salvaged vehicles. Their forms are different, and their value is also different. It seems inappropriate to allow these vehicles within the same urban area. In terms of their nature, they are self-pulled and self-provided, with the aim of earning a living. They operate in remote areas and have limited income. Considering the economic and time aspects, it is not something that can be rectified overnight. If we were to replace them all with new vehicles, not only would all the old vehicles be rendered useless, but how could those who cannot afford to go without food for a day or two immediately afford new vehicles costing eighty or ninety yuan? We are poor people, and even if we sell all our meager belongings, it would not be enough to pay for one rickshaw. Who does not have children, family, and close relatives? How can we bear to resort to the method of 'cutting flesh to heal wounds'? We have no magical way to make money and no one to appeal to. We can only implore your bureau to consider the livelihood of the poor and issue licenses according to the existing number of rickshaws, temporarily allowing them to operate in the West Shanghai area. Only after they have replaced their rickshaw types should they be allowed to travel between South Shanghai and Zhabei to prevent confusion and to avoid the pretext of caring for the poor while still failing to regulate traffic. For the rest of our lives, we will be grateful."</p>
<h3>Male and Female Travelers Commit Suicide by Taking Poison</h3>
<p>The man, a chauffeur, is dead</p>
<p>The woman is in critical condition after taking poison</p>
<p>At 11:30 AM the day before yesterday, a man and a woman arrived at the Zhongzhou Hotel in Maijiaquan and checked into room 107, paying a room fee of one yuan. After entering the room and sitting for a while, they went out and returned in the evening, asking the waiter to buy a newspaper for them to read. Then they took a bath, ate dinner, closed the door, and went to sleep. Yesterday afternoon, the waiter asked the guests if they wanted to change rooms, but no one answered when he knocked on the door. Greatly surprised, he broke down the door and found the man and woman lying on the bed, barely breathing. Realizing that they had committed suicide by taking sleeping pills, he immediately reported it to the front desk, who in turn reported it to the police station. Police officers were dispatched to investigate and found that the man was already dead. According to the registration book, the man was named Wang Wenkui, a local resident, 24 years old. The woman was about 20 years old. The police immediately prepared a vehicle and sent her to Renji Hospital for treatment, where her life was in danger. Later, according to the parents of the deceased Wang Wenkui, his real name was Zhang Jingtao, a native of Yangzhou, and he worked as a chauffeur. He was already married in his hometown, but due to marital discord, he came to Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Publication of Moganshan Map</h3>
<p>A Guide for Tourists</p>
<p>Moganshan is covered with bamboo, and its scenery is beautiful and refreshing. It is not only suitable for sightseeing but also beneficial to health. Since spring, countless celebrities have flocked to the mountain for sightseeing. Recently, Chairman Jiang visited Hangzhou and took half a day of his time to climb the mountain for a short rest. Moganshan's importance is evident. However, the scenic spots and landscapes on the mountain are everywhere, and the newly opened roads are also countless. There has never been a perfect map to guide tourists, which is a pity. Now, the owner of Langgan Villa has taken advantage of his leisure time while touring the mountain to conduct on-site surveys, measurements, and compilation of a map. The map is exquisitely printed in two colors and includes the numbers of the Western-style houses on the mountain, mountain streams, baseball fields, swimming pools, roads, stone paths, trails, contour lines, mountain peaks, parks, etc. With this map, it is as if one has a guide. At the same time, English explanations have been added for the convenience of Westerners. Each copy is only sold for two dimes. The sales locations are the China Travel Service at 114 Sichuan Road, Shanghai, and 56 Hubin Road, Hangzhou. Anyone interested in visiting the mountain should prepare a copy.</p>
<h3>The "Chang'e" Dance Hall Dispute Remains Unresolved</h3>
<p>Before this Case is Concluded,</p>
<p>No One May Operate the Business</p>
<p>The "Chang'e" Dance Hall at the former site of the National Hotel on Tianzhutang Street in the French Concession is involved in a rental dispute. Fang Jiaohui, represented by lawyers Xu Yannian and Jiang Yiping, sued Lu Xihou, Zhang Shangxun, and others in the Criminal Court of the French Court for fraud, extortion, coercion, and other charges. Yesterday, defendant Zhang Shangxun was summoned again but failed to appear. Lu Xihou, represented by his lawyer, claimed that the case was a rental dispute between the plaintiff and Zhang Shangxun and did not involve his client. He argued that the plaintiff should not have implicated him without cause. Plaintiff's lawyer Jiang Yiping stated that defendant Zhang Shangxun had failed to appear after being summoned, indicating an intentional defiance of the court's orders. He requested that the summons be changed to an arrest warrant. Regarding the "Chang'e" Dance Hall, Lu Xihou had sublet it to the Paris Black Cat Dance Hall, and the opening had already been announced in the newspaper. However, the main point of contention between the plaintiff and the defendant lies entirely in the dance hall. Before the case is concluded, how can the defendant lease the business to someone else? He requested that the court issue an order prohibiting the dance hall from operating during the litigation period to avoid further complications. Lawyer Xu Yannian stated that the circumstances of the case were extremely bizarre. Defendant Zhang Shangxun had initially entrusted his lawyers to sue Lu Xihou. However, Zhang suddenly changed his mind without consulting his lawyers and unilaterally filed a petition to withdraw the lawsuit. He believed that the content of the case was very strange, and that certain lawyers were colluding in the matter. He also wanted to negotiate with the Bar Association and requested that the right to sue be reserved. Judge Zhu ordered that before the case is concluded, no one may operate the "Chang'e" Dance Hall, and no items inside the premises may be moved. He further ordered Zhang Shangxun to be summoned again for questioning and investigation.</p>

<h3>Smuggling Soldiers Carrying Opium</h3>
<p>Wang Hualin Confesses to Trafficking</p>
<p>At around 2:00 PM yesterday, Su Baohang, a police officer from the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau's Water Patrol Team, was patrolling the river near the Dongjiadu Wharf in South Shanghai when he saw the Jutai Steamboat berthed there. He immediately boarded the ship for inspection. A soldier in military uniform was seen inside the cabin and appeared flustered when he noticed the police officer. Su, suspecting something, immediately searched the soldier and found a large package of opium, weighing approximately 36 taels, inside a small bundle of military clothing that he was carrying. He took the person and the evidence to the team. During the preliminary hearing led by Captain Xu, the person identified himself as Wang Hualin, 36 years old, from Anhui. He stated that he was a soldier in the Second Company of the Anti-Smuggling Battalion. The opium was purchased for more than one hundred yuan in North City and intended to be brought to Hengmian Town in Pudong. He said he mixed the opium in with his military uniform, bundling it up and assuming that he would be safe along the way because he was wearing a uniform. However, before the ship set sail, he was caught. Wang was charged with being a public servant who dared to smuggle opium, showing a lack of discipline. He was immediately ordered to prepare a document to be sent to the Third Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Pawnshop Owner Accused of Bigamy and Abandonment</h3>
<p>Song Jiasheng, a native of Fengxian residing at No. 2, Yian Lane, Limei Road, French Concession, has a daughter named Guiyu, who is 29 years old. When she was still a toddler, her parents arranged a marriage for her with a son of the Tu family from the same county. However, because she moved to Shanghai with her parents, the marriage has not yet taken place. Guiyu is beautiful, and many people covet her. Two years ago, Sun Runyu, the owner of Yuxing Pawnshop on Sixth Malu, became a widower and was eager to remarry. He admired Guiyu's beauty and used all sorts of inducements, eventually committing adultery with her. He then encouraged her to dissolve the engagement with the Tu family, promising to marry her as his successor wife. Guiyu was young and weak-willed and fell into his trap. Her father, Jiasheng, was concerned about his reputation and did not want to publicize the matter. After the engagement was dissolved, Sun hired Chen Shiliang and Jiang Junfang as formal matchmakers and made a betrothal gift in October of last year according to the lunar calendar. The wedding was held at the Fanwang Palace Hotel. Those who knew the situation said that Sun was truly in love, and even if he had committed adultery first, it was still harmless to marry her. However, Sun's marriage was not sincere. Three days after the wedding, he made an excuse to return to his hometown and has since disappeared, leaving Guiyu neglected. After the woman made repeated inquiries, she learned that Sun had remarried in his hometown to a woman named Xia Ziyu and had abandoned Guiyu. Living in extreme hardship, Song Jiasheng, who had wanted to cover up the matter, could no longer bear it and hired lawyer Chen Tingrui to file a private prosecution against Sun Runyu in the Special District Court for bigamy and abandonment. The Special Court held a hearing a few days ago, but the defendant failed to appear out of fear of punishment. Lawyer Chen requested the issuance of an arrest warrant, which was approved. Sun Runyu may be arrested and brought before the court to face Song Guiyu in the next hearing.</p>

In our opinion, Mr. Zhang's usual behavior and the allegations in the report are all innocent implications. We respectfully request your court to quickly clarify the situation and maintain his reputation."</p>
<h3>News from Various Labor Unions</h3>
<p>The Seamen's General Union issued an order to all levels of its branches the day before yesterday, stating that the Union's secretary, Hua Yuzhou, reported that since the reorganization of the Union in the 17th year of the Republic of China [1928], over ten thousand official documents have been issued. Among them, there are many with splendid content and writing, concerning international politics, labor movements, ceremonies, and other important matters. If the essence of these official documents could be collected, compiled into a book, and distributed to all levels of the Union branches and sold to labor organizations, (1) it would allow the Union's work to be publicized to the world, and (2) it would allow readers to learn through browsing, observation, and imitation. Based on this rationale, he plans to start organizing this project. However, copying and printing materials all require capital, and the current funds are limited, making it difficult to allocate. Therefore, he proposes to instruct all levels of the branch to contribute one thousand silver dollars from their income to cover the cost of materials, and to prepare a budget table to be submitted to the Union for consideration and implementation. After compilation, the proposed title is "Seamen's Official Documents," which will be divided into categories such as submissions, official letters, correspondence, instructions, directives, announcements, postal correspondence, declarations, ceremonies, appointment letters, etc. A budget table is attached for reference. The Union's 27th standing committee meeting has already decided to proceed as proposed. In addition to distribution, please find attached the table, and order the respective branches to comply and collect the required material cost of silver dollars to fund the compilation without delay.</p>

Passed. (6) A worker who had been expelled from the Union by Cai Tongde recently sent a representative to the Union requesting reinstatement. The Union had sent a representative to negotiate and promised to handle it according to previous examples, but the representative had not yet expressed anything. How should this be handled? It was resolved to notify the representative to come to the Union for negotiation within ten days; otherwise, reconsideration would be rejected, and all members would be notified that workers from that store are permanently prohibited from doing any work or temporary work in other stores within the city. Passed. (7) Regarding the letter from Qi Jinxian requesting reinstatement in the Union, how should the Union handle it? It was resolved that Qi Jinxian's expulsion from the Union was an order from a higher level, and the Union has no authority to intervene and should submit it to the higher level for handling. Passed. (8) Regarding the letter from Lu Ziqing requesting reinstatement, how should it be handled? It was resolved to review the previous case and discuss it again. Passed. (9) Recently, employers have been attacking the Union, and the news is frequently published in newspapers, which is detrimental to the Union. How should the Union respond? It was resolved to issue a declaration to announce the Union's principles to all sectors and to notify all members to unite to prevent employers from taking advantage of loopholes and to preserve the glorious history of the past. Meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>An Unprecedented Song and Dance Extravaganza at the Summer Peacock</h3>
<p>The Summer Peacock Grand Theatre on Jing'an Temple Road is the birthplace of song and dance. In the past, various famous European and American song and dance troupes, such as Dennis Duncan, have performed at the theater and received enthusiastic support from the public. The theater has always refused to rent to Chinese song and dance troupes, so no Chinese song and dance troupes have ever performed at the theater. However, the Liwa Song and Dance Troupe, which caused a sensation at one time, was recognized by the theater as the only most perfect Chinese song and dance troupe, and the troupe's director, Ms. Wei Yingbo, has always been praised by Westerners. Therefore, there is this unprecedented cooperation between a Chinese song and dance troupe and a Western theater, opening a new era for the Chinese song and dance world and adding glory to the Chinese art world. It is said that the opening date is from the 25th of this month, and the program will be in accordance with the theater's film schedule, with three performances day and night. The program is completely new, such as the scenery and costumes of the play "Luoshen," which have cost thousands of gold. There are more than 60 actors on stage, and its magnificence is self-evident. It is also said that the scripts of the troupe's plays are all written by the writer Mr. Yin Tianku, and the lyrics and music are all new and poetic.</p>

<h3>Purple Swallows Piercing the Waves: An Examination of Ice Skating</h3>
<p>— Li Liantang</p>
<p>The game of ice skating has existed in our country for a long time. Zhu Zhutuo's "Old News Under the Sun" mentions, "By the Taiye Pond in winter, ice plays were practiced and rewards were given to cultivate national customs." Also, the "Yanjing Chronicle" says, "Ice skates are made of iron, with leather straps inside to tie to the shoes. When the body stands up, it moves and cannot stop temporarily. The skillful ones are like dragonflies skimming the water and purple swallows piercing the waves, which is quite a sight to behold." The Western game of ice skating originated in Sweden and spread throughout Europe. If the Taiye ice play recorded in "Old News Under the Sun" was to cultivate national customs, and national customs refers to the national customs of Manchuria, then is the origin of Chinese ice play not like Europe's origin in Sweden? At the beginning of European ice skating, the shoes were bound with animal bones. At the beginning of ice skating in our country, the shoes were bound with iron strips. Is the creativity of our country not very precious and unique? But who was this creator of ice skating among the yellow race? Was he born in Manchuria or in Beiping? If he was born in Beiping, did he ever go to Miaofeng Mountain to see the clouds or to Jianxin Studio to listen to the water? There is no way to know his life's achievements, and his name and birthplace are also untraceable. This is truly regrettable for those who are interested. This is how ice skating is seen in records.</p>
<p>The Yilantang in Beihai Park was once where Qianlong and Cixi watched ice plays. In the eleventh year of Qianlong, the Emperor Qianlong wrote a poem about the Taiye ice play, saying, "Following the time to present national customs, choosing a place to test heroes, orders are transmitted like rivers, and dignity records the water officials... Riding the wind in formation, discussing difficulties day by day... Surpassing the group with dazzling speed, making gestures even more graceful, imitating the sound of strings urging arrows, and the appearance of mirrors dancing with phoenixes." Also, the preface to the Taiye Ice Play Couplet says, "Touching the shoes, the sharp blade is sharpened, and the cannons roar and invite travel." It can be seen that the popularity of ice skating was at its peak at that time. The cannons roaring and following the rules indicate that there were not only ice skaters but also ice skating teams. Descending to today, old ice skates from the Qianlong and Jiaqing eras and the Tongguang period can still be found in the old capital, and the Qianlong Imperial Appreciation of the Ice Battle Chart is still carefully preserved in the Palace Museum's Archives. This is the evidence of ice skating in the dynasty of that era.</p>
<p>In the winter of the eighteenth year of the Republic of China [1929], I practiced ice skating on the Fuyang River in Li Zhen, Jixian County, Hebei. The onlookers were like a market, admiring and envying, looking at each other and laughing, all thinking that they had seen something they had never seen before. Only one old man approached with a cane and said, "Let me see your shoes." I raised my ice skates to him. After the old man finished looking, he sighed and said, "This is slightly different from the old ice skates of our country, but largely the same. When I was young, there were no postal services or railways in the country. Usually, it took half a month for letters and mailbags from Tianjin to reach our town. But every winter, letters from Tianjin would arrive in just one day, relying on ice skaters. The ice skaters would tie mailbags to their backs, put on ice skates, and go down the Fuyang River. They would leave Tianjin in the morning and arrive in Daming in the evening. Even riding the wind would not be as fast as them. I haven't seen ice skaters in our town for thirty years. I never thought I would see them again in you today. It turns out that ice skating, which our country had in the past, was not only used for self-entertainment but also for human affairs." This is the evidence that can be provided by ice skating. Alas, if people do not think of their ancestors, then the virtuous should follow their example. If the art of ice skating had not originated in Europe and they were quietly practiced, would it not be an account of their ancestors? "Learning Records" says: "Store it, rest in it, play in it." Confucius said: "Set your mind on the Dao, base yourself on virtue, rely on benevolence, and play in the arts." Ice skating is an art, and ice skating is a game. Is it not said that a small path is worth watching?</p>
<h3>A Record of the Annual Meeting of the China Child Education Society</h3>
<p>— Ms. Ye Hua</p>
<p>Since the European War, educational organizations have flourished like bamboo shoots after a spring rain, especially in Russia and Austria. The China Child Education Society in our country has also emerged in response to the trend. The society began its annual meeting on the 18th, and members from various places in Shanghai arrived gracefully. Many famous educators also came together, making it a grand occasion. I will excerpt one or two things to leave a mark.</p>
<p>After a long separation, they talked about their longing. The members mostly came from the education departments and normal departments of various schools, so they were all classmates. Since singing the parting song from their alma mater, they had scattered like swallows and swifts. Although they were close in the same city or district, they were usually too busy with their own affairs to gather together, making them feel that although they were close, it was not easy to meet. Those who lived far away in the corners of the earth felt even more longing. On the occasion of the annual meeting, old friends from the past stood together arm in arm. Some had not seen each other for a year, and some had been separated for ten or twenty years. When they met, they were surprised and delighted. The longer the separation, the deeper the affection. It was the season of spring, and the thoughts were particularly strong, especially among the female classmates. I had been separated from Liu Xuezhi, Zhang Mingyi, Wang Huixiu, Huang Yusheng, and other friends for a long time. Once we met, we could not help but feel attached to each other. The most moving thing was that the meeting bell had already rung three times, but groups of three or five were still lingering in the corner of the venue, talking from the bottom of their hearts, as if they did not hear the loud bell.</p>
<p>In the midst of songs and music, true innocence was revealed. On the first day of the annual meeting, children from the United States, China, and Japan performed recreational activities. The American children took the stage in different costumes. When singing, the arrangements were not always equal in length, and the children, who were seven or eight years old, were lively and behaved as if no one else was around. They were worthy of being the people of a free country. The Japanese children wore their native homespun short shirts and pants, and had shaved heads. Their faces were yellow and brown, and their bodies were strong and sturdy, like people from Shandong in our country practicing martial arts, somersaulting and tumbling. Could this be a legacy of the Bushido spirit? Examining the lives of samurai in the feudal era of Japan, the most important things were swordsmanship and reading. It cannot be said that this trend has not entered the schools, and weak children should be wary. On another day, young girls performed ancient dances. An old woman on the side plucked the strings on the ground and sang, not breaking away from the inheritance of history.</p>
<p>In the gentle spring breeze, they toured the South Garden. Xu Peihuang, director of the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, hosted a banquet for the members of the society in the South Garden. The garden belongs to Jian Zhaonan and is a place for Buddhist studies in Shanghai. Now it is renamed Jueyuan, and the architectural layout is similar to that of Southern Europe. The winding paths are secluded, and the flowers and trees are lush. I remember holding my mother's clothes and listening to Master Taixu lecturing on the scriptures. Before I reached adulthood, several years had passed in a hurry, and things had changed, but the scenery of the garden remained the same. Revisiting the old place gave me a sense of the past and present. On that day, half of the visitors were members and the other half were colleagues from the Education Bureau. The number exceeded 400, and the flower-shaded road was crowded. After the photography, refreshments were served in the Xiangguang Room. The tables and chairs used were from the Sangha equipment. How fortunate we were to taste this Taoist object! During the meeting, Director Xu said that he welcomed the members of the society to visit "Nanyuan" and "Jueyuan," meaning that the society was a "south" needle for education and a forerunner and "Jue" for education, which can be said to be extremely appropriate.</p>
<h3>Chenguang Art Society to Open Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Fa Qing</p>
<p>The Chenguang Art Society has not held an exhibition for a long time, and many art lovers regret this for the society. Because the society has been established for twelve years, it held an exhibition once a year before 1925, and it has made progress every year. At that time, the only one who contended with Chenguang was Tianma Association. Tianma Association announced its cessation after ten exhibitions, while Chenguang only held five exhibitions and stopped halfway. This is what we cannot help but regret.</p>
<p>I have now learned that the Chenguang Exhibition will continue to be held. Those who know the inside story know that all the members of Chenguang are party members. During the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army, the society mostly served in the political departments of the various armies and devoted itself to propaganda work, which led to the dispersal of its members and the de facto suspension of the exhibition. Now that the military affairs have ended and the north and south are unified, the members have returned from the military one after another. In these years of revolutionary upsurge that shook the world, the members have personally experienced and described various situations and lives during the revolutionary period, accumulating a great deal of material. There are also new writers who have worked hard in these years and their research works are also abundant. The leaders of the society, such as Zhu Yingpeng, Song Zhiqin, and Wang Daoyuan, are extremely enthusiastic about art and culture, so they decided to open the fifth exhibition. The venue has been borrowed from the Shanghai Art College at the intersection of Jiangwan Road and Tongji Road. It is said that the exhibition period is from the 25th of this month to the 3rd of the next month. Famous writers Chen Baoyi, Qiu Daiming, Fang Ganmin, Li Jinfu, Wang Rongjun, Guan Zilan, and Xu Suling all have exhibits, totaling more than 100 pieces, all of which are large-scale. In this bright spring, there is such a magnificent exhibition for us to appreciate, and the grand occasion at that time is almost predictable.</p>
<h3>Predicative News of the Shaanxi Disaster Relief Charity Show</h3>
<p>— Wu Yunyan</p>
<p>General Zhu Qinglan came south to help with the Shaanxi disaster, and enthusiastic people in Shanghai have been soliciting donations in various ways, and the collected funds have been remitted to Shaanxi to provide relief to the millions of starving disaster victims. This is truly a righteous act. Gentlemen in the film industry are enthusiastic about public welfare and dare not lag behind. They have recently agreed to the request of the Shaanxi Disaster Relief Association to hold a show at the original site of the City Hall for three days from Friday to Sunday of next week. All the ticket proceeds will be used to help the disaster. It has been learned that the programs of the Star Opera and Drama Companies are as follows: On the first day, Peking Opera stars Ms. Hu Die and Mr. Zhou Jianyun will perform "You Long Xi Feng." On the second day, Ms. Gu Meijun and Mr. Zheng Xiaoqiu will perform "The Shepherd Boy." Ms. Xuan Jinglin and Mr. Xie Yunqing will perform "Su San Qi Jie." On the third day, the drama "Laughter and Tears" will be performed by Mr. Zheng Zhengqiu, Ms. Hu Die, Mr. Wang Xianzhai, Mr. Cai Chusheng, and Ms. Gao Hanying. It seems that such a gathering of famous actors and stars can be expected to be lively.</p>
<p>News Flash: Ms. Wei Yingbo, a famous Chinese song and dance director, has recently responded to the needs of the times and joined forces with well-known figures in Shanghai's film industry and well-respected song and dance experts to create a large-scale Liwa Song and Dance Troupe, which is divided into eight departments: rehearsal, scriptwriting, dance, singing, stage scenery, clothing, general affairs, and business, each of which is staffed by experts. More than 120 actors have begun rehearsals, and after three months of rehearsals, six major song and dance dramas, including "Youth Under the Moon," "A Period," "Under the Pomegranate Skirt," "Li Ying," and "Luoshen," are said to be scheduled to premiere at the Summer Peacock on Jing'an Temple Road starting on the 24th of this month.</p>
<h3>A Trivial Record of the Just Execution of Taibao Ashu (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Zhu Tian</p>
<p>Taibao Ashu Xu Tianxiong, the bandit leader of Taihu Lake, has been rampant in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, accumulating countless cases. His arrest in Shanghai this time can be said to be a case of Heaven's net having large meshes but letting nothing slip through. On the 16th of this month, he was escorted from Minhang to Zhangyan Town, Jinshan County, to be executed. His younger brother, Xu Fusheng, was also executed at the same time. According to people from the First District of the Minhang Water Police, the situation of Taibao Ashu and his brother in prison and the circumstances before and after their execution were not reported by various newspapers, so I am writing this supplement.</p>
<p>Preferential Treatment in Residence: Taibao Ashu was detained in a small room next to the reception room in the First District of the Minhang Water Police. There were several sofas in the room, and Taibao often leaned on them for a rest when he had nothing to do all day. Also, fearing that he would be depressed and sick, the Chief Inspector and the Detective Chief stayed by his side every day, discussing the affairs of the world, which made Taibao very happy and almost forgot that he was in prison. Taibao had a good appetite and could eat three bowls of rice at each meal. The dishes were also very exquisite, with fish, meat, vegetables, and bamboo shoots arranged all over the table. The average daily cost of dishes was more than one dollar. Taibao was an opium addict and smoked more than ten yuan of opium every day. When he was escorted from Shanghai to Minhang, he had not touched it for several days and was exhausted. The district office immediately bought several yuan worth of opium for him, which was never interrupted. Until two days before the execution, Taibao voluntarily quit and refused to smoke, saying that he was very grateful for the preferential treatment he received here, but he would be escorted to another place in the future and would not be able to think about it again, so it was better to plan for it early. At the same time, his younger brother, Xu Fusheng, was detained in the detention center with other criminals and treated the same. So-called different status.</p>
<p>Negotiations for Photography: Since the news of the execution of Taibao Ashu was spread, reporters from various newspapers in Shanghai rushed to Minhang and set off together. Photography reporters were especially busy. In addition, Xu District Chief's movie camera, Xu District Chief's son's camera, and other private cameras were taken along to watch the execution. The overseers of the French Concession also carried a camera in their hands, which was a very lively scene. At 1:30 PM on the 16th, Taibao Ashu and his brother were escorted to Zhangyan Town and taken directly to the headquarters of the Second Regiment of the Security Team Infantry to rest temporarily. A certain regimental adjutant came out and prohibited photography, ordering the adjutant to temporarily store the cameras of everyone in the regimental headquarters and return them after the execution. He claimed that beheading was not a criminal law and that the photos could not be published in the newspaper. Reporters from various newspapers immediately protested and negotiated back and forth for a long time. Finally, it was still allowed to take photos openly, but it was not allowed to take photos of the beheading to prevent its external propaganda.</p>
<h3>Travel Notes of India (31)</h3>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>The vegetable garden and flower garden in the temple have a pleasant aroma in the wind. I asked the monks if they also worked, and they replied that the vegetable garden was very large and sometimes they hired workers, and sometimes the monks themselves tilled the land and planted vegetables. I very much approve of the farming and working monks. This method of external Tao is better than the internal Tao of sitting and eating. Since the Sixth Ancestor of Chinese Buddhists attained enlightenment by pounding rice, the stone tied to his waist is in Huangmei County. According to Liu Zhongyun, the Sixth Ancestor used to work in Huangmei, and because the rice heap was light, he tied a stone around his waist to increase the weight and make it easier to pound the rice. He was so hardworking that he could attain enlightenment. How can there be a reason to sit and eat? And now there is a Bhikkhu Dayong who wrote an article before his death saying that monks should never work and that they have already repaid the society's kindness. This is certainly not without reason, but how can it be feasible today? And how can one explain the Sixth Ancestor's labor meditation? I also saw spinning wheels in the temple, which is probably due to Gandhi's teachings that monks should also work. Master Taixu is a teacher of Dayong and has long advocated the theory of agricultural meditation and labor meditation, which I very much agree with. Seeing the Indian monks' self-cooking and planting, one can know the method of changing the lives of Buddhist disciples.</p>
<p>The White Building Temple can represent Indian Hinduism, but according to the monks, this is not its main temple but a branch. The main temple is in a certain place not far to the north. Every April, thousands of men and women come from afar to have a communal meal here. There are five temples of the White Building sect in this area, and there are also many other sects. It is difficult to say in a word the advantages and disadvantages of Hinduism. From the perspective of Buddhism, it is an external Tao, meaning that its worldly laws are more. Gandhi is its representative. Gandhi repeatedly mentions the Geda classics but does not discuss Buddhism, meaning that Hinduism is rigid. In short, life is life, and society is complex. It cannot be said to be purely materialistic economic relations, and religion and politics should not be overemphasized. They are for an average theory. The rise and fall of various European countries are not equal to the same Christianity, and the rise of Japan and Siam and the fall of Korea and Myanmar are not the same as the Chinese Confucianism, and the rise and fall of the twenty-four dynasties are only those people. Hindu monks also wish to come to China to propagate. In this era, it is not necessary to regard them as external Tao and reject them. Comparative research should be used to welcome them. I heard from the former philosopher Shen Zipei that Buddhism, Yuanism, Esotericism, and all religions are included and there is no external Tao. It is a pity that China has gained very little from Indian philosophy because it has been criticized by Buddhism. Now, the cultures of all nations are like a hundred flowers blooming, and only the method of scientific analysis and comparison can be beneficial to the culture of human society.</p>
<p>The appearance of Indians is a valuable study. Originally, the Buddha valued appearance very much, and there were many monks with strange and great appearances. Now, looking at the image of the famous Hindu monk Feifukenan, it is unusually majestic, and Indians boast that he subdued Europeans and Americans. However, I do not entirely agree. I remember that a certain gentleman saw the image of a certain famous monk and said that this monster must not be a monk and must disturb the world, just like the strange image of Bodhidharma and Zhang Fei. It is also a kind of strange person who likes to cultivate strange images. If the Buddha image is only kind, broad, and not strange, Gandhi's image is only a worker, plain and unremarkable. I mean, what's the use of being strange? The majestic strangeness exposed to the outside is only ominous, and I have no interest in it.</p>

<h3>Financial Standard Gold in Hovering</h3>
<p>A Slight Increase: Yesterday, the 21st, the standard gold continued to trend higher, but with slight changes, fluctuating by three or four taels to six or seven taels at a time. From morning to night, there were a total of twelve taels of fluctuations, resulting in a slight increase of just over two taels. The receipts and disbursements of each firm were different. Although the overseas silver market fell, it had been initially anticipated the previous evening, so the gold price was slightly dampened early on. Then it weakened, perhaps due to the agility of the sellers. As the foreign exchange narrowed by half a point, the domestic market also showed a slight improvement. Afterwards, large buyers entered the market to compete for purchases, and there were occasional short coverings, especially due to the tension in the exchange restriction notes, causing the market to shake sharply and rise by ten taels, suddenly surging. Beyond 727 taels, and with sellers appearing to be numerous, it turned mild. The after-market weakened from strong, likely due to the exchange notes turning flat and the complex situation in the market. Finally, it hovered around 20 taels, with the possibility of further declines in large deals this morning.</p>
<p>Unstable Fluctuations: From the opening of the six-month session early on, seven qian [0.7 taels] was added, making it 718 taels and 5 qian. Large deals fell by 16/3, and the silver price rose by 8/3. Private telegrams were the same, but the market was flat. The United States was already waiting and seeing. Afterwards, there were slight fluctuations of one or two taels, but Wanxing, Hengxing, Shunli, etc. all sold, causing the price to fall. From 19 taels and 5 qian, it dropped to 15 taels and 5 qian. British gold seemed to loosen, and Mitsui and others bought 7/8 of 625 to 6875, and then Tong Taichang and others purchased, causing it to rise by two taels. First, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation announced a narrowing of 125 U.S. dollars. At 25 days and one point and 25 qian, it was 18 taels. However, Hengxing continued to sell, immediately suppressing it by a little over one tael, totaling 16 taels and 3/4 qian. At 10:00 AM, Dadecheng, Chenfeng, Yongheng, Yu, etc. came in, and because it was difficult to settle British gold at 625, the dealers stopped selling and changed to settling at only 5625. Therefore, at 10:15 AM, it rose to 23 taels. Then, Changsheng, Yongda, Xingyong, and speculators sold, so it depreciated by three taels, totaling 20 taels. At 3:30 PM, Xinxheng, Dadecheng, Hengxing, Yuancui, Changyong, etc. joined hands and advanced, mainly because the British gold bank sold at half a penny to 4375, and the market atmosphere suddenly rose and soared by more than seven taels, reaching 27 taels and 5 qian at 11:15 PM. Afterwards, the Dalian gang's selling pressure was still strong, and in just over ten minutes, it retreated by more than three taels to 23 taels and 8/9 qian. Tong Taichang and others purchased and jumped up two taels again to 25 taels and 6/7 qian. The Dalian gang sold again, and at noon it was only 22 taels and a half, then it added about the same amount, because the buyers were not lonely. The price was changed to 765 taels, totaling a hold of 48 taels to 38 taels at noon, 41/2 taels.</p>
<p>Then it fell again. The afternoon market opened at 24 taels, then 5 taels and 1 qian, because Mitsui ate 6 months of British gold at 1.35. Afterwards, it could be settled at 1.35, and Shunli and Wanxing sold it, so it retreated to 22 taels. In a flash, the Indian exchange rate reported a drop of 7/8 annas, and it immediately soared to 26 taels. Afterwards, Yuanmao, Yongqian, Changxiang, Wanxing, etc. sold one after another, and the exchange notes were still in a state of emergency and weakness, so it was poured out by more than 7 taels. At 3:00 PM, it was finally 18 taels and a half, fully driven by the bank's eating of British gold at 5625. Also, Tong Taichang bought in, and in an instant, it pulled up 4 taels to 22 taels and a half. The retail investors took this opportunity to sell, and at 3:15 PM it was 19 taels. Yuanmao, Yongyuan, Heng, Jing, Mr. Wu, and others bought it and added it to 23 taels. Immediately after, Sumitomo and others sold British gold at 5625, and now it has been suppressed to just over 20 taels. At 3:30 PM, it was heard that the recent Indian exchange rate would not be farther away and the distant period would be slightly reduced by 4 annas, plus one tael and more. At 4:00 PM, it was 22 taels, but the sellers on the platform continued to sell. It was 19 taels and 8 qian close to the market. At 4:30 PM, the closing market was 20 taels, which was still an increase of two taels and two qian compared to the previous day. Then, it was made into a large amount of money. The largest price of the whole day was 27 taels and a half, and the smallest price was 15 taels and a half, a difference of twelve taels. The goods in the morning market were 19 taels and a half, and the afternoon closing was 24 taels. The afternoon was 23 taels and 6 qian, and the closing market was 21 taels. The marked price was a hold of 40 taels to 45 taels, and the book price was 21 taels to 23 taels. The water was 17 taels, and the afternoon was 14 taels.</p>
<p>Inconsistent Inflow and Outflow: The transactions of each firm were as follows: Cuichangyong, Qianchangxiang, Shengfengyong, Dadecheng, and Fuxingyong all entered. Shunli, Hengxing, Wanxing, Changsheng Yong, Zhifengyong, and Yuanmaoyong all exited. Yuantai, Futaiheng, Yuanheng, Fuchang, Fuyu, etc. had unequal inflows and outflows. Xinxheng covered some short positions. In the afternoon, Tong Taichang, Cuichangyong, and Dadecheng all entered. Zhifengyong, Fuchang, and Yuanheng Yuanmaoyong alternately entered and exited. Qianchangxiang, Fuxingyong, Yiyu, Wanxing, and Shunli all made hedging transactions with both purchases and sales. The exchange notes were inconsistent. The Guangdong gang issued a total of more than 1,000 notes, and the Dalian gang supplied more than they demanded, issuing a total of 3,000+ notes and taking in 1,000+ notes.</p>

<h3>Interest Market Sees High Momentum Again</h3>
<p>General Market Situation: Recently, although the spot silver dollar market in Shanghai is not very strong, the daily transactions are still bustling and can be considered a good opportunity. Therefore, the trend of the interest rate is still rising amidst fluctuations. As for the buying and selling situation of banks, they consider the current price to be irrelevant and do not pay attention to it. It is generally believed that if the interest rate on silver dollars exceeds 0.03, there will be competition and maintenance measures to save it.</p>
<p>Interest Rate Quotations (Silver Dollar Interest): The interest rate in the early market did not change much due to balanced supply and demand, remaining at 7 qian, 2 fen, 8 li, and a half hao. The noon market then rose by 0.00375 to 7 qian, 2 fen, 8 li, 8 hao, and 7 hu, resulting in a rate approximately 0.01 better than the early market rate the day before. (Silver Discount) Because the silver market has been loose for a long time, people do not bother to ask about the rise and fall of this silver discount. Therefore, both the morning and noon markets yesterday remained the same at 0.02. Liu Toubai also sold to colleagues, and no one cared. Moreover, the head liners tended to sell to their colleagues.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market Conditions: The early and noon markets for small silver coins from Jiangnan were both 0.065, the same as the previous noon.

The transaction volume was 95,000 jiao in the early market and 70,000 jiao in the noon market. Copper coins were changed to a short of 500 to 370,00500 wen.</p>
<p>Silver and Foreign Dollar Inflow and Outflow (Silver): Yesterday, the banks' collection and delivery of news was relatively sparse. Chinese merchants collected and delivered over 1.9 million in drafts, foreign merchants collected and delivered over 2 million, and various cargo exchange tax and miscellaneous items amounted to 8.45 million. Outbound from the warehouse was 400,000. Japanese banks collected and delivered over 4.2 million in various items, and outbound from the warehouse was 500,000.

<h3>The Yarn, Cotton Yarn Market Holds Steady, Showing Signs of Stability</h3>
<p>The yarn market is slightly firm, and the trend is still soft. Because actual sales have not been very smooth, and the customs declaration issue has not been completely resolved, most retail investors have very low morale and are actively selling short on rallies. Moreover, this month's supply of 10-count coarse yarn is abundant, so sellers are very confident and have no intention of covering short positions. Therefore, the overall situation remains one of fluctuation. However, the overseas cotton yarn market is gradually turning around. The price of yarn from the three districts has recently risen by 4 yuan, but large long positions have not been active. Most people are watching for a price of around 160 taels.</p>
<p>The human standard (yarn) rose slightly. The human standard (yarn) opened higher in the early market due to the surge in American cotton, but the market sentiment softened and fell again in the second half of the session. The close rose slightly, with each month rising by only 0.01, 0.02, or 0.03 yuan. In the afternoon, it was reported that gold prices were good, and the price of yarn from the three districts rose. The spot cotton market rose, and the market sentiment turned firm, with each rising by 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, or 0.06 yuan. The total transaction volume was 18,800 bales. It was found that Senkang sold 1,000 bales, Shenda sold 450 bales, Tongyu sold 700 bales, Yijiang sold 450 bales, and Heshen sold 400 bales. Gengfeng bought 1,200 bales, Shenyu bought 800 bales, Changfeng bought 100 bales, Daji bought 500 bales, Dafu bought 450 bales, and Xinfeng bought 700 bales. The closing prices are recorded below.</p>
<p>Human Standard Closing Prices Rise and Fall Inventory Number</p>
<p>April 163.2 Rise... 22200 July 165.8 Rise 760550</p>
<p>May 164.5 Rise 647950 August 165.9 660700</p>
<p>June 165.0 Rise 372700 September 162.8 616900</p>
<p>Yarn Sales Were Quieter. Current yarn sales were relatively flat. It was found that various gangs bought a total of 950 bales throughout the day, and colleagues bought 700 bales. The price of Japanese yarn fell slightly. Among the customer gangs, Sichuan bought 410 bales, the inland area bought 115 bales, Guangdong bought 210 bales, Anqing bought 25 bales, the northern gang bought 30 bales, and the miscellaneous gang bought 115 bales.</p>
<h3>The Cotton Market Is In Progress</h3>
<p>The cotton market is very firm, because the overseas cotton market is stable, and the exchange rate is difficult to loosen. The spot goods in Shanghai are scarce, and people's morale is strong. Japanese merchants have a very firm attitude and do not relax at all, and they buy in on dips. The Japanese Dongmian Foreign Company sells spot goods and buys futures. Therefore, the market rose in the afternoon. However, some people sold short due to sluggish factory demand. In short, the future cannot be predicted before the inventory is exhausted.</p>
<p>Han Standard Rose 3-4 Qian. The Han Standard opened higher in the early market due to the slight rise in American cotton, but Indian cotton still fell, and the market sentiment was still scattered. Later, it rose slightly by 0.01 to 0.015 yuan due to the news of good gold prices. In the afternoon, Japanese merchants sold spot cotton. It was heard that various factories had some intention of activity, and the market sentiment suddenly tightened. Each rose by 0.03 or 0.04 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 49,600 bales. It was found that Rongxing sold 2,200 dan, Taixing sold 2,400 dan, Yiyu sold 1,800 dan, and Yuanda sold 1,000 dan. Jifeng bought 1,600 dan, Gengfeng bought 3,300 dan, Changfeng bought 2,000 dan, and Xinheng bought 2,200 dan. The closing prices are listed below.</p>

<p>Shaanxi Flower 40.50, Yongan Factory bought 300 pieces, spot delivery to the factory</p>

<h3>Foreign Cotton Yarn Rises More Than It Falls</h3>
<p>American cotton purchasing power turned strong. Yesterday, American cotton was firm due to purchases by colleagues, short covering, and a lack of sellers. Futures were estimated to be up 0.03 to 0.06 pounds. Spot prices were unchanged. British cotton futures were up 9 points, and spot prices were up 7 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices were up 10 points. Indian cotton initially rose along with American cotton, but then weakened due to long covering and poor news from Liverpool. The Pingle near-term and forward fell 1 rupee, Aomura fell 1 rupee, the forward fell 2 rupees, Bai Luoxi was unchanged, and the forward fell 1 rupee. The original telegram is recorded on the left (20th dispatch).</p>

<h3>Grain Market: Rice Market Firm and Quiet Amidst Cloudy Weather</h3>
<p>In Zhabei yesterday, due to continuous rain, the supply was extremely scarce. Sales in the market were not very prosperous because river cargo was difficult to open. However, people’s morale was very good. There were not many transactions for white japonica river cargo from the northern gang. Warehouse cargo was still slightly active, and prices gradually became firmer. Special top-quality japonica was around 12.5 yuan. Although the thin rice market was quiet, the overall trend felt firm and strong. The highest-priced was also between 11.2 and 11.3 yuan. There were slight transactions for Yangdu and various indica varieties, with various parties selectively inquiring about higher prices. The overall market continued to rise by several points. Baiyuan's sales were mediocre, and the market became even quieter due to the rain.</p>
<p>Yesterday, not many river boats arrived in Shanghai South. Most of the sales in the local street were watching due to the rain. Therefore, the number of buyers visiting the market throughout the day decreased. On the West Road and North Road, those inquiring about white japonica rice chose to buy at higher prices, but ordinary transactions were also slightly active. The overall market rose by nearly 0.1 yuan. Sales of thin early rice from various South Road areas were flat, and the market was firm. The arrival of Yangdu indica rice was not strong. All parties were standing by due to the rain, and the market showed a firm trend. Bian Yuan's arrival and sales were both weak, and the market was not prosperous.</p>
<h3>The Flour Market Weakens and Then Recovers</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the market for each month was extremely unstable because the quoted price of foreign wheat fell by 0.03, 0.04, or 0.05 yuan, resulting in a decline of about 0.01 yuan compared to the closing price of the previous day. Later, because there were still many outside speculators with firm intentions, they competed to buy in, so the near and far terms weakened and then recovered. In the afternoon, after the ships opened, the factory attitude remained cautious, and there were few offers for both near and far terms. Moreover, the wheat market not only did not seem to be affected but was even better than the previous day, so the inside and outside speculators turned positive. The price rose by more than 0.015 yuan from the morning's lowest price. As a result, the current month was better by 0.005, May was better by 0.0025, June and July were better by 0.005, and August and September were better by 0.0025.</p>
<h3>The Wheat Futures Market Remains Steady</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market in the morning, the market for each month was still firm, even though the price of foreign wheat fell by 0.03, 0.04, or 0.05 yuan. Because the current month was close to delivery, all the hedging of the brokers had been gradually collected in advance, and the actual chips had to be reduced compared to the previous month. Therefore, although squeezing the shorts was not the right time, the position of the shorts was already dangerous. The overseas trend has now changed, and it is feared that it will be easier to change foreign wheat into foreign flour.</p>
<p>The tide wheat itself has been solid, and it is estimated that there are not many selling households. Therefore, the market sentiment in each section of the afternoon was particularly stable, and the asking price for each month was raised by another 0.01 or 0.02 yuan compared to the morning. As a result, the current month was better by 0.03 than the previous day, May and June rose by 0.04, July was better by 0.02, August was better by 0.03, and September was better by 0.02.</p>
<h3>The Sugar Market Suddenly Rises for Both Raw and White Sugar</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market's area telegram reported that the current price of Cuban sugar had fallen by 0.03125 compared to the previous telegram. The price of New York sugar futures had fallen by 0.02 for each month. There was still no telegram from the Java sugar market. The association market allocated Dutch sugar 24 raw and white sugar, and the market was quite strong. At first, the asking price was 10 taels and 0.045, and the high price was 10 taels and 0.055. However, there were few buyers, and a small number of households were willing to compromise. The transaction price was 10 taels and 0.04, and the high price was 10 taels and 0.05. Several hundred bags were traded, and the market was quite lively. No. 20 medium raw white sugar was 9 taels and 0.09. The market was also stable. Japanese sugar transactions were more active, and the market rose by another 0.05, and it was strong. N mark 10 taels 0.05 YT mark 10 taels 0.0375 to 0.04 Minghua cargo 10 taels 0.035 to 0.0375 YP mark 10 taels 0.0725 Meiji 10 taels 0.075 TX mark 10 taels 0.0675 SH and TM mark prices were all 10 taels 0.01 J mark 10 taels 0.085 Taikoo B mark 10 taels 0.08 All trends were firm. Japanese sugar allocation, Meiji Minghua May and June cargo bills allocation has been gone, but a reply telegram is required to confirm.</p>
<p>Silk, Tea, and Soup Cocoon Prices All Surge</p>
<p>Since silk weaving factories in Jiangzhe and other provinces have seen smooth sales of semi-silk woven products, the demand for silk cocoon and scrap has been strong, causing market prices to surge. The soup cocoon market has also been very firm recently. Yesterday, 120 dan of silk head soup cocoons were imported from the inland, priced at 40 taels. 80 dan of silk factory soup cocoons were priced at 48 taels, which was another 0.02 or 0.03 yuan higher than before.</p>
<h3>Small Profits, Heavy Capital: Silk Sales Are Difficult to Smooth</h3>
<p>The European and American markets for raw silk factory sales remain sluggish. Therefore, the telegrams for silk prices are getting smaller. The Chinese silk merchants think the losses are too great, and the intention to sell is still weak. Only Bidi and others entered Shanghai with 20 packages of white factory silk. Xinfu entered Sichuan yellow factory silk with 10 packages. Xinshichang entered white dry silk with 5 packages. Gaobei entered 6 packages of yellow coarse silk. The prices were all flat.</p>
<h3>High-Quality Meijin Green Tea Sales to Europe Continue Smoothly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the local foreign tea market, the Meijin green tea from the Zhongxi and Yin counties continued to be searched for by Tongfu and Jinlong and other firms. The market was still not quiet. The total transaction volume for the market was over 720 boxes, and the selling price ranged from 45 to 60 taels. It was found that each firm had exported no more than 52,000 boxes of Meijin recently. The sales were quite rapid. The current inventory in the market is only 2,000 boxes, so it seems not difficult to sell them all. However, because the tea price is too low, the losses suffered by Chinese merchants are 0.03 or 0.04 yuan per dan.</p>
<p>The Wholesale Eastern Goods Market Appetite Remains Strong</p>
<p>Wholesale transactions were extremely dull because customs declaration workers were still on strike and it was raining. There were no special ups and downs in the market.

The Moon Hua velvet with large patterns already needed 0.0215, the medium patterns were 0.02125, the Double Dog Water Wave velvet was 0.022, and the Foreign Beauty was 0.0235. They were all goods that were going to be covered up and sent on their way.</p>
<h3>Woolen and Summer Goods Sales Are Active</h3>
<p>There were no special rises and falls in the wholesale wool market. Retail transactions were still prosperous. The wool goods needed for summer sales are currently being bought up by all parties.

<p>Metal Goods: Continuous Rain Affects Market Transactions</p>
<p>Yesterday, due to continuous rain, customers who needed metal goods from various gangs waited for the weather to clear before handling them. The business of colleagues dismantling goods also felt reduced. Therefore, there were no special transactions in the whole market, and the market situation was quite quiet.</p>
<p>Flower Ring Lead Wire: 0.5-0.6 Bundles Arrived Yesterday, the long-dormant flower ring lead wire was found to have been bought up by the Yangtze River and Tianjin, and the market was becoming active. An estimated 4.75. It is reported that the Japanese had shipped another 0.5-0.6 bundles to the Mitsubishi Company warehouse, so the future market should not have any shortage problems.</p>
<p>The Shortage of Small Patterns of the Original Nails The original nail business has been quite developed. Although several factories are trying their best to ship goods, there is still insufficient supply, and the small pattern is especially lacking in the current market. Therefore, the prices are soaring by 0.04-0.05 yuan, and it is still impossible to buy them. It is reported that customers from Hankou and other areas have to handle them, so the market situation is quite optimistic.</p>
<p>The New Lead Wire Supply is Greater Than the Demand. The new lead wire inventory is sufficient for 3-4 months of sales. Therefore, the general colleagues are quite panicked. The standard situation is getting worse and worse. Currently, No. 16 to No. 20 are only sold for 13.34. No. 21 to No. 25 are estimated to be 19.25 per dan. It is reported that there are only scattered transactions.</p>

<p>Yuzhong Industrial Cooperative Society in Dexin Xili, Tianbao Road, Hongkou, announces that our society has newly produced A-character brand domestic clothing powder, also known as marking chalk. The texture is firm, the lines are clear, and the color is fresh. It does not come off when rubbed by hand, and it is comparable to imported products. The price is very low. Major merchants are very enthusiastic to purchase in bulk, etc.</p>
<p>Changtai Tobacco Company, No. 19 Jiujiang Road, announces that our company's manager directly imports and sells European famous brand cigars for the use of the upper class.

All large and small tobacco shops sell them.</p>
<p>Economic Pure Charcoal Portrait Studio announces that the paintings produced by our studio are extremely pure. "Pure" means that they are entirely drawn with charcoal powder, and then sprayed with a scientific liquid to prevent permanent discoloration. "Impure" means that charcoal powder is mixed with ink (for example, buttons, collars, and other places are drawn with ink and then coated with charcoal powder. Not only is the drawing different from the original photo, but the style is also inelegant). After the drawing is completed, it is washed with water to distinguish between "pure" and "impure." We are holding a month-long special price promotion, with the commission calculated at 80% of the original price. We are also offering a special 12-inch complimentary drawing for one month. During the complimentary drawing period, each portrait is only six dimes (postage for return to the local area is included, and postage for other areas is one cent). The photos to be drawn are limited to four-inch half-length portraits or larger. Full-body portraits will not be accepted. The receiving address is Hu Yimei, upstairs at Tongtai Yuan, No. 1280 Guanyin Pavilion, Beijing Road, etc.</p>

<h3>Random Notes on a Trip to Beiping</h3>
<p>— Ping An</p>
<p>12. Apartments</p>
<p>The first unique thing about Beiping that I visited after arriving in Beiping was its apartments.</p>
<p>When the Chinese literary world had not yet moved from Beiping to Shanghai a few years ago, I often came across descriptions of the lives of wandering students living in Beiping in literary works. Arriving in Beiping, if one had the chance to visit an apartment, naturally one would be delighted to see it again. The so-called apartment is like a "boarding house" in the South. The guests who live inside are generally impoverished students. It doesn't matter if they miss a meal, it doesn't matter if they don't take a bath for dozens of days, it doesn't matter if they don't shave their heads and beards for two or three months, or if they always wear that blue cloth shirt for months... It doesn't matter at all, but they have to smoke cigarettes. Maybe they'll have a glass of wine for fun. They have to watch operas. If they really don't have money, they have to open their throats and sing to themselves. Especially in Beiping, maybe they also have to love the shining kiln. If there are any new literary books or new publications, they have to find a way to spend a few cents to buy one to read. These are all the lives of romantic young people living in art. In my personal opinion, the impoverished young people wandering in Beiping's apartments are even more miserable than the young friends living in Shanghai's boarding houses or renting small rooms. I went to the apartment because I accompanied a friend to see a friend whose girlfriend lived in a dilapidated apartment. The friend didn't necessarily want me to go, but he didn't necessarily say he didn't want me to go. Since I was happy to go, that was fine. When I arrived at the apartment, I really couldn't think of a sentence that could describe my feelings at that moment. Of course, I wouldn't be like a wealthy, delicate lady who feels uneasy and cramped when she enters a poor person's house. However, to describe the dilapidation of the apartment in the most appropriate way, it was even uglier than the house of a so-called impoverished family. The four walls had no bricks. There was a layer of reeds in the middle, and a layer of newspapers was pasted on the reeds. The old windows were also pasted with paper, and the ceiling was also pasted with newspapers. Two long benches, three or four pieces of wooden boards, a dilapidated washstand, and a broken table - that was a room. The rooms were small, but if one could arrange two or three beds in one room, people would live under such a pathetic ceiling. Naturally, everything was customary. Even if that kind of life was terrible, they would get used to it and it wouldn't matter. When I went, it was winter. There was a fire in the house, burning in a tile stove. It wasn't coal, it was coal. The host saw us coming and bought some peanuts and a few pieces of candy, and poured a cup of hot water. So everyone gathered around the stove, read the newspaper, and chatted. Needless to say, this kind of life is very interesting. People's tastes in life vary. Some people can't live this kind of life no matter what, but others can be content with it and be happy. I think that people who live this kind of life look poor, but they don't necessarily have to be poor. Some of them are because of their interests, especially young people and young students. This kind of life is very appealing to them. This kind of life has both advantages and disadvantages. Speaking of its advantages and disadvantages, naturally I'm not referring to material things. I'm talking about the impact of this kind of life on the thoughts and learning of the people living in it, that is, whether they are progressing or not. Today's education is a complete failure, it is a complete deception. Even the students who are studying understand this, but the traditional ideas bind a person's heart. If you really say that because today's education is a failure and studying is a deception, you have to find another way to seek knowledge, you don't have the courage to put it into practice. How do you know if your will will be firm and unaffected by external temptations after you leave school? No one can answer this question. So in the end, knowing that studying at university is deceiving your parents and deceiving yourself, you have no choice but to muddle through. Teachers are the same. Teachers should not think about whether their teaching can help students gain knowledge, how much they can gain, and how much it can affect the country and society. Teachers who think about these things should commit suicide. Teachers should just go to school on time, teach classes, and get paid every day. Let everything muddle through, because there is no way to do anything about it.</p>
<p>I've gone too far astray and have to get back on track. Living in an apartment, you can do all sorts of romantic things, and no one will control you. The only person who can control you is yourself. Living a romantic life doesn't necessarily mean that you're not making progress. You know that experience and knowledge don't necessarily come from books. Experience and knowledge come from many practical actions. Practical actions can affect psychological changes, and psychological changes can affect changes in thought. So some people say that going out to play for a day is better than reading a book at home for a day. If people living in apartments have a plan, that is, if they have a plan and a clear idea for their studies, even if they occasionally indulge in a few days of absurdity, they can still not run too far, so far that they can't recover, then I believe that kind of free reading (naturally, getting someone to guide them is another matter), free thinking, and free exploration will be more effective than reading books, eating, getting up, and sleeping in these universities that seem like sanatoriums for lung disease.</p>
<h3>Spring Picnic</h3>
<p>— Feng Kui</p>
<p>Letter of Invitation</p>
<p>The God of Spring, draped in brocade and silk, and containing sweet smiles, has descended to earth peacefully on some beautiful evening.</p>
<p>The earth presents a new景象. Who says it's not the seeds scattered by the God of Spring? Look, nature is dressed in green clothes and dotted with red rouge, gracefully and deliberately competing with each other, swaying her slender waist in the wind. The peach tree is unwilling to let the willow monopolize the youth, and has hurriedly put on her adorable pink coat overnight. The pond water is also unwilling to fall behind, using white geese that particularly highlight the youthful and emotional nature of the girl to fulfill the pond water's original intention, and is particularly happy to swim. "White feathers float on the green water, red palms ripple the clear waves." This is a truly vivid painting.</p>
<p>But a great feast is hard to repeat. That sketch of the new spring has gradually turned to another stage. The red has faded and the green has thickened, and the spring light is about to disappear. However, the ardent young men and women are still immersed in the prosperous and beautifying atmosphere of spring, and have not yet anticipated that the Spring Maiden is about to bid farewell to people.</p>
<p>Yes, Jiangwan Road, which has been repeatedly praised by a group of people, does have a place that makes people who have been living in the pigeon-cage-style lanes yearn for. There is the beautiful No. 63 Garden, the vast Hongkou Park, and the swimming pool that is about to open. That area is a school district. Within an area of only one bus stop on the public bus, there are the three-legged legal schools of Chih Chih and Aiguo. Every evening, when the setting sun shines obliquely, the moonlight reveals her delicate face shyly, wanting to appear and yet slow. The sun is like a brave knight, his face full of the light of his military prowess. The two of them stand facing each other from east to west, reflecting each other, but it happens to be the natural strength and softness. The worthy Jiangwan Road is peacefully shrouded in the air full of artistic and poetic flavor, but it is tinged with a blush like a girl's face. Affectionate couples take advantage of this beautiful scenery to indulge in joy, intoxicated. This is the strength and softness of people.</p>
<p>Friends, you have been living by the bustling roads and lanes. Have you ever felt isolated from nature and yearned for the poetic and picturesque Jiangwan area? At the same time, I can also tell you that this is not entirely the countryside. Cars and horse-drawn carriages can also be seen at any time. Japanese women carrying packages, Western children carrying briefcases, artists holding easels and sketching, and athletes running naked are all images of the city that are sent into your eyes. It can be said to be a small model of the urbanization of the countryside and the ruralization of the city. For the sake of your inability to live this harmonious life, I have long wanted to invite you to come to me to breathe in some fresher air. Unfortunately, there has never been a suitable opportunity. Dear sisters, this cannot but be considered a regrettable thing, because we are not all idle people. Those who serve are serving, and those who study are studying. Where is there time to get together often? Since we are all in Shanghai, in fact, we are no different from being separated by mountains and rivers.</p>
<p>Okay, finally we have a wonderful opportunity. On the 25th of this month, the Chenguang Art Association will open its fifth Western painting exhibition. The venue is the Shanghai Art College in Tiantong'an. The location of the school is suitable for both Jiangwan and Hongkou. On this beautiful spring day, it is a good opportunity for us to seek fragrance. We should also emulate the infatuated men and women of Jiangwan Road, unaware that the end of spring is approaching, hand in hand, wandering and wholeheartedly projected into the arms of the God of Spring, tenderly intoxicated. Therefore, I resolutely decided to implement the following plan.</p>
<p>Wait a minute, friends, let me first introduce to you the general situation of this painting exhibition so that you can get the gist of it when you come to see it that day. As for what exactly the plan is, you have to be patient and wait a moment to hear me tell it with a smile.</p>
<p>Recently, I often see Shuren, so I am able to know something about the exhibition. The exhibitors at this exhibition include Chen Baoyi, Wang Daoyuan, Zhu Yingpeng, Chen Zhifo, Song Zhiqin, Wang Rongjun, Zhang Meisun, Zeng Zhiliang, Xu Suling, Wang Shuren, Yang Qiuren, Fang Ganmin, Qiu Daiming, Guan Zilan, Weng Yuanchun, Chen Qiucao, Dou Xueou, Fan Xinqiong, Li Jinfang, and other artists. The works are roughly divided into four categories: the first category is the depiction of the lives of the people; the second is about China's national humiliation and the suffering of the people; the third is the history of the revolution; and the fourth is folk tales. Among them, there are many that I love. As for the content of the paintings and the reasons why I love them, I don't need to describe them one by one here, firstly because I am afraid of taking up the valuable space of this garden, and secondly because I will use them as talking points when we get together.</p>
<p>As for what I said above, what exactly is the plan? To put it simply, I think you will definitely be happy too. I plan to sincerely wait for your arrival at the venue from 1 pm on the afternoons of the 25th and 26th. If you think my hospitality is just a simple reception and cannot answer questions about the paintings, then I can ask Shuren and Huizhong to help me with the reception. I think I will always give you a more satisfactory answer.</p>
<p>I am preparing to buy a lot of food, soda, canned goods, side dishes, bread, jam, and butter. In addition, Mom said that Miss Chen and Miss Wu like to eat curry chicken, and Mr. Li loves to eat tea eggs. At that time, they will also be indispensable. Sha Qian and Ji Zeng, do you think so? Xiaolan and Xuankui, Zi Jing, what do you like to eat? I hope you will notify me immediately after seeing this letter so that I can ask Mom to prepare. As for which of you will come on the 25th or 26th, that is not a problem. Fortunately, I am preparing the same thing on both days. Mom has allowed me not to eat indoors, and will probably ask Amei to deliver it to the big pool in Hongkou Park that I specified at around 5 o'clock. We can also have a small picnic.</p>
<p>We haven't had such a big gathering for a long time. Friends, do you have this request like me? I have already asked Zhenqiong to bring her two little sisters.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>However, Ji Zeng, you must also invite Miss Yang to come with you. Rest assured, we won't snatch your beautiful girl away. Look how generous Huizhen is. Didn't she come out with Mr. Guo that time? Qing Qian and Xuan, the three of you have always been very cultivated. If you also have lovers, you must also invite them to come. All my friends, if you see my simple invitation, please come. Please rest assured that my food will definitely not cause panic.</p>
<p>Your friend Feng Kui respectfully invites you.</p>
<h3>Collection of Specimens by the Department of Biology at Jinan University</h3>
<p>The Department of Biology at Jinan University has always been famous for its complete facilities and advanced curriculum. However, its facilities, such as all specimens, are collected by students during their travels over the years, which is more applicable than purchasing them at high prices. Currently, due to the soaring price of gold and the limited funds of the school, it has been decided to conduct a large-scale collection of specimens this year to further enrich the facilities and increase experiments. All third- and fourth-year students of the school must participate, a total of about eighty students, divided into four teams. Each team has ten third-year students and ten fourth-year students, so that fourth-year students can guide third-year students. Each team is led by two professors. The first team will travel to Jiujiang and Mount Lu, the second team will travel to Mount Heng in Hunan, the third team will go to Mount Tai in Shandong, and the fourth team will go to Dayu Mountain between Guangdong and Jiangxi. The period of three months will be used for this trip. During this three-month travel period, classes will be held for four hours every day according to the schedule to avoid neglecting studies. The remaining time will be used by the professors to assign students to search the valleys for various animal, plant, and mineral specimens. The first team in Jiujiang and Mount Lu will pay special attention to plant specimens, because Mount Lu has many rare flowers and plants that are rarely seen by people. The second team in Mount Heng will pay attention to all kinds of specimens. The third team in Mount Tai will focus on animals. The fourth team will focus on minerals. When collecting specimens, professors will also work together. All kinds of equipment must be brought. When digging, instruments that can dig to a depth of twenty feet must be prepared, so that valuable specimens can be obtained. It is also said that this collection plans to collect more than 300,000 species. Each student must collect at least twenty species. Those who exceed this number will be rewarded by the school, and those who do not reach this number will still participate in the next trip to make up the number. Otherwise, they will not be given credits and cannot graduate. Therefore, students of all grades are actively involved and their spirits are greatly enhanced. In addition, in order to train students' physique and make them have the spirit of enduring hardship, the school specially stipulates that this trip is not allowed to stay in hotels. "All must camp in the mountains, and work must also be camped in the wilderness. Only when it is unavoidable can temples be temporarily borrowed to rest. After returning to school, an exhibition will be held to display the exhibits for viewing, etc.</p>
<h3>Shanghai East Branch of the Caoye Society</h3>
<p>— Xu Yi</p>
<p>Mention Caoye and everyone will know that it is a publishing house at No. 34 Fielun Road in this city. It was established on May 1, 1929. The inaugural issue of Caoye was published on May 4. The initial founders were four students from the Department of Chinese Studies at Zhengfeng College of Arts and Sciences. Among the four, Mr. Song Hongming and Mr. Zhou Peisheng are currently studying at Chih Chih and have long been disassociated from Caoye. This is not because they had disagreements, but because they did not like each other. Mr. Guo Lanxin had a longer relationship with Caoye, and gradually became estranged only at the end of the second volume. He is now working at the Shanghai Municipal Land Bureau. Among the four, Mr. Jin Kuansheng has been striving and maintaining the development from the beginning to the present. His interest has not shown any signs of fatigue.</p>
<p>When Guo Lanxin resigned, Mr. Wang Tiehua first joined the group as a strong new force. Mr. Tang Zengyang also began to appear on the scene in a few days. Later, Mr. Huang Huanruo and Mr. Zou Fang also joined the group.</p>
<p>The development of Caoye is very slow, because the members who run Caoye all have their own jobs and take advantage of their spare time to rush to do the affairs of the society and the publication of Caoye, which often leads to delays in publication. Wang Tiehua is studying law and politics at the Faculty of Law, Tang Zengyang and Huang Huanruo are studying at Fudan, Zou Fang graduated from Fudan last year and is currently teaching at Labor University, and Jin Kuansheng is working as an English-French clerk at the Abel Cloud Marble Factory at No. 18 A Taopeng Road. Each of them has their own jobs and lives in different places, one in northern Shanghai, one in eastern Shanghai, and one in central Shanghai, which makes it difficult to achieve anything. Therefore, after the establishment of the Hangzhou branch on September 15 last year, the intention was to set up a branch office in Shanghai to be handled by the above-mentioned members nearby. Therefore, the Shanghai East Branch was first established by Mr. Jin Kuansheng. He lives in the branch, and the headquarters on Fielun Road is run by his younger brother. He also goes to inspect it every night to deal with urgent matters.</p>
<p>The branch office is located at No. 33 Lianglu Fang, next to the Mingyuan Garden on Huade Road in eastern Shanghai. It is a newly built Shikumen building that has now been fully arranged and started working. Readers and those who have relations with Caoye can directly go to the branch office to inquire about everything. Mr. Jin also wants to invite all community members and readers to the branch office for tea parties every Sunday to discuss everything and connect friendship, so that the community affairs can get more help from the majority and can easily develop.</p>
<p>The Caoye Bookstore wants to restore its original state soon and asks several community members to help sort it out, because the address of the headquarters on Fielun Road is not suitable for office work due to its size. Now the branch office can put all its efforts into handling community affairs, and the landlord is generous and the location is quiet.</p>
<p>The Caoye Society has published "Between Flesh and Spirit", "Rose-Colored Dream", "Solo", "Premarital Notes", "Sister's Remains", and "Fragrant Kiss", all of which are bestsellers in various places. In addition, "Caoye Weekly", which is published in the groups of young men and women in major middle and elementary schools in this city, has now reached Volume 5, No. 3. The "Caoye Annual" in 1931 has also been published on the 15th of this month. The second collection is being printed and can be published around May 1.</p>
<p>Caoye has a lot of contacts with other literary and artistic groups, and hopes to gradually connect with groups that have not yet been contacted, and is willing to exchange and promote each other with various literary and artistic publications.</p>
<h3>Female Students of Jinan University Organize Basketball Team</h3>
<p>The Jiangnan University Sports Association decided this year that women's groups should be added to all events of the championship sports, except for baseball and football, because these two items are not suitable for female physique. After hearing this news, the female students of Jinan University discussed the organization of a basketball team and practiced every day to compete with various universities. There are more than eighty female students in Jinan University who are good at basketball, but unfortunately there is no fixed organization for practice at ordinary times, and the practice is quite lacking. In view of this, the female students elected Ms. Li Jinhua as the captain and Ms. Wang Kexiang as the manager. The two ladies are responsible for investigating which students are good at basketball. After a detailed investigation, more than 20 strong players were found. They were immediately summoned to decide that the practice time would be from 6 am to 7 am every day, and the director of physical education was asked to designate a female basketball court on the open space north of the lotus pond. The construction of the ball rack was started on the same day, and it was completed in less than three days. The place is quiet and the field is flat, and all the female athletes are quite happy. The director of physical education also sent Wang, the physical education instructor, to be the female basketball instructor to teach various shooting and defensive methods and various female basketball rules. After half a month of training, the results are very impressive.</p>
<p>It is said that Instructor Wang said that the rules of female basketball are simple and easy to practice. As long as the physique is good and can last for a long time without exhaustion, victory can be controlled. The female students of Jinan University are all from Nanyang and Guangdong, and their physique is far stronger than that of women elsewhere. The female basketball team of Jinan University is a new organization, but the results are so good because of their strong physique.</p>
<p>The official team members have been selected by Instructor Wang, eight in total. Captain Li is the center forward, very agile and tall, and his throws are said to be unique. Manager Wang is also a talented forward, serving as the right forward and echoing Ms. Li, able to come up with surprising plans to win. In addition, Ms. Xu Guoying serves as the left forward. She is also very strong and her passing has reached the level of perfection, and her speed is also her special skill (Xu Guoying often made a big splash in the sprint at the school sports meeting). Therefore, if the three forwards do not get the ball, they have already scored. Ms. Hua Yunzhen is the reserve player for the right forward, and Ms. Lei Xiaoshu is the reserve player for the left forward. Their skills are also excellent. Ms. Zhong Kezhen is the right guard, and her ball-snatching technique is excellent, able to prevent the enemy from approaching the basket and assist the front. The merits are endless and cannot be said completely. A few days ago, the team played a friendly match with Beimen Girls' School and surprisingly defeated the team that had been on the battlefield for a long time with a newly organized team.</p>
<h3>Fudan Drama Society Rehearses "The Liar"</h3>
<p>— Yutian</p>
<p>The Fudan Drama Society's annual performance of plays will be held again this semester during the pomegranate season. It is said that the play to be performed by the society this time is the British Jones' masterpiece "The Liar" (originally "The Lying Women"), adapted by Mr. Zhu Duanjun. The play has four acts and is Jones' representative work and a representative work of British comedy. The intention is profound and the structure is rigorous, unprecedented. The third act, the round of lies, is the most interesting and humorous part of the whole play, and is well-known in the theater world. The emotions of the whole play are implicit and the words are obscure, which is different from the cold humor of the French school of comedy. It is currently being rehearsed every day and is expected to be rehearsed in the school in mid-May. After the first rehearsal, it will be scheduled to be performed in Shanghai, etc.</p>
