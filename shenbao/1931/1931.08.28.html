<p>時評</p>
<h3>最近中國學術界之兩大年會（一）</h3>
<p>中國科學社與中華農學會</p>
<p>最近我國學術界中有兩大年會。一爲中國科學社在鎭江舉行之第十六屆年會。一爲中華農學會在北平舉行之第十四屆年會。中國科學社設有生物研究所科學圖書館。工作頗爲努力。近年來貢獻亦頗多中華農學會成立於民國五年。各省農業界學者大都参加。爲國内研究農學之一重要團體。在目前洪水横流。我全國人民同苦於自然界迫害之際。科學社與農學會於一片水災聲中。先後舉行年會。吾人彌覺其足以重視。記者謹以無限之熱望。敬致其希冀之忱。</p>
<p>我國以農立國嚮以精神文明自尙惟其以農立國故農業之進步與退落乃爲我國家存亡之關鍵。惟其以精神文明自尙。故對於世界進步之科學。常發生思想上與行爲上之義和團。淸代之（中學爲體西學爲用）說。近年來蠢蠢欲試之復古運動。同使我國科學之發展。遠落於歐美各國之後。即以此次洪水而論。一般人民所得之敎訓。不爲人力未盡。不爲科學未發達。不爲今後如何用手與腦戰勝自然。戰勝物質。而爲（昊天不吊。）爲（天降閔兇。）爲（皇天震怒。）或且爲（金龍大王作怪。）（水伯逞威）總之人民之對洪水之所能體認者。只爲不可避免之天災。不可挽救之怪水。故水來時惟有呼天。惟有待死。水退後惟有逃荒。惟有求乞。漢口各界爲水災舉祈禱。呼靈於天。且聞當地長官。亦有參加者。國内人民科學知識如此落後。其恃爲立國之本之農業。安得而不衰落。國家安得而不貧亂交迫。人民安得而不流離輾轉。生無食所。死無葬處。就此種現象而言。是則農業會所負之責任。其重大爲如何。而科學社所負之責任。其重大更爲如何。</p>
<p>人類之所以高出於動物者。厥爲人能創製工具。使用工具。吾人試回首人類文化之軌跡。由有史以後之茹毛飲血。穴居野處。使用石器時代以至於文化昌明之現代。由崇拜自然時代進而至於征服自然利用自然之現代。凡此文化之積累。要皆科學進展之軌跡。故科學之眞意義。即爲人類爲供應并满足其生存上之需要。用腦與手創製使用物質之工具。并求其使用時之時間物質與人力。都逹到極經濟之地步。有史以來之人類社會。即有其科學。實不始有於二十世紀之現代。</p>
<p>人類對於經騐自然界未知事物之態度。第一步爲驚奇。即驚奇此新事物之爲（何物。）繼之爲好奇。即懷疑此新事物。（從何而來。）更繼之爲利用。即開始經騐此新事物（有何用）。人類知識書中。每一新頁之標點符號。第一爲（！）其次爲（？。）最後乃爲使用之痕跡。故我國非無科學也。特農業因襲其舊有之農業方法與技術。工業因襲其舊有家庭工業手工業之方法與技術。舉凡一切思想與行動。在歐美皆已成過去之軌跡。在我則正保守勿替。對於在歐美各國所創製之新鮮事物。正投以驚奇之眼光。而哇然呌出（呀！。）投以懷疑之眼光。而冷然呌出（咦？。）視以人力救治天災爲不可能。視以化學方法製造食品爲神話。試取今日馳駛於歐美各國窮鄉僻壤之摩脫車。馳駛於水面之汽艇。及種種農業工業上機器。陳之於我佔全國人數百分之八十以上之農民之前。其有不驚爲奇物怪獸而奔走駭汗者乎。人以日益邁進於幸福之境域。我則仍不免於受水旱疫疾種種自然之迫害。（物競自擇。適者生存。）國人固都應努力。而農業會與科会氏社諸君子。則更應如何急起直追。迎頭趕上去。</p>

<h3>談測量與救災</h3>
<p>先將接收江陰吳淞一叚測量</p>
<p>災民避走内地軍艦無從援救</p>
<p>海次兼江南造船所所長陳紹寛氏、昨來滬上、國聞社紀者晤陳于船所、叩以最近接收海甆測量及海船救災等兩事、所談經過、誌錄如下、</p>
<p>接辦測量陳謂昔時我國對海上測量、素不注重、且無一正式與專理測量之機關故、一切事宜、盡由海關辦理、直到今日、航輪欲覔一航海地圖、非向外人購取不可、近年來海軍鑒於海上測量、事關國防、故一面自起設局、派艦測量、但同時海關理船廳、仍派其專條·流星兩測量巡輪、赴口外測量、今海軍旣設有專局、爲統一事權計、海關測量、自應移轉、且海軍二年來、對於長江及江浙閩沿岸海線、行將測竣、所未測者、僅數要港岸、於是海部迭向海關商洽接收、現江陰至吳淞一段正由本埠海軍測量局局長吳光宗會同海關理船廳西人漢而門辦理轉移、與轉移後之具體方法、大約兩三星期内必可接收完竣、至其所轄之專條流星兩測量巡輪、因口内外尙有燈塔與浮筒之關係、暫時仍由海關管理、</p>
<p>派艦救災漢口原泊有楚謙·仁勝·兩全艦、嗣因接得慈善團體、要求派艦赴救漢災、與保護災民、故臨時復調沿江之咸寗·楚有·德勝·威勝·四艦前往、但大半災民咸避至内地高處、軍艦不能駛進、故至今救援無從、祗所謂負保護而已、外傳沿江水漲、股匪出没、盡不確、即有之、亦屬地方一二土氓攔路搶竊而已、海軍現西至監利、南至長沙湘潭、沿江有軍艦駐紮、此次京滬一带颶風爲災、海軍毫無損失、祗本埠船所第二船塢底泥土鬆陷、江水湧入、與江邊所蓋運廠被風吹折一二處、損失並不重大、</p>
<p>會操未曅第一艦隊司令陳季良率海容海籌等十艦、在閩洋三都會操、須操至九月中旬、方能告畢、故前傳海容派往古巴、參加華僑革命紀念塔開幕一事、殆難實現云、</p>

<h3>持三刀殺妻</h3>
<p>妻不安分夫下毒手</p>
<p>被戳八刀血流遍體</p>
<p>前日下午九時五十分許、滬西家渡存善里、發生夫婦口角、夫竟藏持利刀三把、將妻猛戳八刀、性命危殆之慘劇一案、爰將詳情、探錄於下、</p>
<p>家庭狀况住居曹家渡存善里五號之董鶴良、年二十八歲、本地人、前在安迪生電燈砲廠作工爲業、性甚誠篤、克勤克儉、勉力成家、娶妻李氏、現年祗二十有三、亦本地人、妻容艇麗、體態苗條、性亦風流、結褵以來、迄已三載、初因夫婦同廠作工、所入勉右敷衍、故雙方情感尙睦、惟氏年輕愛俏、鑒於夫之樸實、卒有不满之意、</p>
<p>起釁原因董自去年間被廠中停歇之後、敷衍在家、其妻雖仍在該廠做工、則一月所得工資、亦不足以維家用、董因一無所入、祗得藉典質以彌補、於是日積月累、虧負頗巨、乃氏本存不满、乘此野心勃發、近忽與某有染、視夫如同陌路、現董得悉妻有外遇、時向勸導、不特如耳邊之風、抑且反而辱駡、前日董適有事在外、忽見妻與一男、並肩而去、董遂怨憤萬分、旣怨失業之無能、又憤愛妻之背棄、當即怏怏而返、預藏利剌三把、頓萌殺妻之念、</p>
<p>慘劇所見迨至下午鍾鳴九下、該氏由外而返、董初默無一言、霎時氏鑒夫容憤怒、預備睡臥之際、董忽啓口詰氏、在外何幹、於是雙方唇槍舌劍、口角頓生、董遂一躍而起、將氏扭住、拔刀猛向腹部連戳兩刀、刀失落地、又於腰間復拔二刀、向氏兩腿連戳六處、氏即痛極倒地、血流如注、該屋二房東瞥見慘狀、不妨卒覩、立即鳴警到來、一併拘回該管六區警署、</p>
<p>審問口供任區長得報後、當以該氏傷勢頗劇、立即車送紅十字會醫院救治、據醫士云、傷勢甚重、恐有性命之虞、又據董鶴良供、因妻李氏、近來與人私通、向之勸導、反被辱駡、故而憤恨已極、出此毒手等語、任區長以案關持刀傷害、昨特備文解送地方法院訊究、</p>

<h3>發售冒牌府綢</h3>
<p>僞造單雙鹿牌府綢</p>
<p>復冒用他人之名義</p>
<p>羅龐二方提起訴訟</p>
<p>所追損失分作兩部</p>
<p>漢口路大豐綢莊股東兼經理深子槎·及該莊股東金醴泉、因共僞造久成洽記·與外成志記兩綢莊所共有之單雙鹿牌府綢商標、曁冒署該兩莊主羅坤祥·龐竹卿·之名義、案發被羅·龐·兩人延律師在第一特區地方法院提起刑事自訴、請求按律懲處外、並附带私訴、要求賠償損失銀　　萬　壬三百六十　兩詢二假　商標之巨案、惟案情頗爲裑雜、業經法院數度開庭研訊、猶未終結、兹撮述其内容如次、</p>
<p>羅龐各設一莊緣羅·龐二人、前曾夥開久成府綢莊、所製府綢、以單鹿·雙鹿·爲商標、先後向北京政府及國民政府註册專利、沈子磋原爲久成雇夥、厥後羅·龐·分立、各營一莊、牌號均稱久成、但羅則加洽記、龐莊則加志記、</p>
<p>沈立大豐綢莊沈於羅龐分立後、遂糾合金醴泉等、創設大豐綢莊、深知久成之府綢、行銷甚暢、獲利極優、乃僞造該項商標之貨物潛行兜銷、羅等雖早有所聞、以無佐證未與交涉、</p>
<p>發現雙鹿府綢迨至本年六月二十五日、久成洽記夥羅坤陽送貨往法租界法商伯興洋行貨棧、突見堆存單雙鹿牌之府綢甚多、且商標俱係僞造、詢據該洋行大班弃茜及跑街夥邱連生等言、係由大豐所售、</p>
<p>價格廉於久成當白於羅坤祥、禀請法國領事簽發搜查狀、飭令法捕房派捕馳往伯興貨棧、將早牌府綢九百饖疋、搜存法領署、一面赴伯興洋行調查賬簿、悉其自去年十二月起、陸續裝運出口之該牌府綢、已有二萬九千五百六十一疋之多、其中註明向大豐購買者、則爲二萬一千零十疋、價格皆較久成低廉、</p>
<p>冒名僞造商標旋羅復報由公共租界捕房、轉請第一特區法院出票、派捕往大豐綢莊搜查、獲有關係賬簿十册、核算其自去年起、售與伯興府綢、總數爲二萬五千七百六十四疋、其中註明單鹿雙鹿商標者、爲一萬一千三百六十一疋、而其僞造該牌之貨、則爲三萬四千一百三十四件、彼除僞造商標外、所印廣告、亦假冒久志志記及龐竹卿之名義、於是始與沈等交涉、　　訴追兩部損失沈則諉稱該貨係向久成志記跑街夥龐春生購買、而匪轉售與伯與者、並謂春生乃龐竹卿之姪云云、但龐竹卿絶對否認有此族姪、以沈金實係飾詞圖卸責任、故請求按律治罪、至所追損失、則分兩部、（一）被告銷出之僞造貨品、至少在三萬四千一百三十四疋以上、每疋盈利以二兩計算、應賠六萬八千二百六十八兩、（二）自僞造之貨發現後、羅·龐·兩莊銷路銳減、每家所受損失、奚　十萬、故最低限度、應令賠償銀十萬兩云云、惟被告亦延有律師辯護、現審理終結、定期下禮拜一宣判、</p>

<p>敎育消息</p>
<p>特載</p>
<h3>補習敎育的效用在那裏</h3>
<p>江問漁（一）</p>
<p>通常所謂補習敎育、大概皆是爲小學畢業、無力升學、現正從事於農工商職業之靑年而設、目的在利用工作餘時、補授以職業上必要的知能、及與職業有關係的科學常識、又於靑年立身處世的公民道德服務道德、亦同時加以相當的訓導、因爲此種敎育的對象、是職業界服務的靑年、而補習的課程、又是重在職業知能的灌輸與訓練、故在學制上往往把他列在職業敎育範圍之内、或逕稱之爲（職業補習敎育）、</p>
<p>試略略考察近代各文明國補習敎育的歷史、最初的設施、大概皆如上文所說、可是近來漸漸不同了、因爲敎育思潮、趨向於平民化、於是敎育制度、亦就趨向於社會化、所以就横的一方面看旣要人人皆能夠受較高深的敎育、就縱的一方面看、自然也就要把此種非正式的補習敎育程度、逐漸提高、絶不願意使敎育的權利、爲少數人所壟斷、歐美各國、且不論、即就日本來說罷、近數年來補習敎育的（學科制）、已漸漸進化爲（學年制）、就是從前的補習、大都以專習一科或兩科爲目的、一科習完敎育即算終了、面所謂某某科者大都限於職業、而最近則不盡以科爲限、多數改爲（學年、）就是除專授職業學科外、並注意於其他文化敎育各科、以期受敎育的靑年、穫得完全訓練、使之旣能謀生、又能做人、故現以學年爲限、而不復以（學科）爲限、不但此也如靑年訓練所辦法、除職業訓練人格修養外、更致意於軍事訓練、那尤其是補習敎育特殊的一種了、講到課程、復分出若干級、低的等於中學初期、高的超過中學而近於專門科的初步、我們看到日本一處的情形、其他各國也就不難推知了、本來是（天下無難事、只怕有心人、）儘管生長寒家、無力升學小學畢業、即入商店、或工廠做一個學徒、而能每天於工作之後、修學二三小時、繼續全八年或十年之久、其程度未必不及高中畢業生、未必不及專門學校的一二年級、我想、只要有供給這種敎育的機關、一定有這種艱苦卓絶的靑年、日本現在不是已有這樣趨勢了麽、並且如大學講座、夜大學、亦未嘗不可列入補習敎育範圍、英國不是有一位小學畢業的工人、因爲受過補習敎育復到大學講座、聽講多年、一旦内閣改組、竟做某部部長了麽、大家千萬不要看不起這（未入流）的非正統的敎育啊、要知道不是正途出身的、倒也有不少奇才異能的人物哩、</p>
<p>說到我們中國、正式的學校敎育、尙未能普及、尙未能辦得像樣、甚且因爲有了學校、反而使社會生出許多不好現象、致社會一般人痛心疾首、那裏還能說到非正式的學校敎育補習敎育呢、可是、我的意見、却不是這樣、我以爲惟期正式學校敎育、未能普及、惟其正式學校敎育、没有辦好、惟其社會不满意於現在學校、而補習敎育、更要特别注重、用他來補徧救弊、以期解决種種困難、所以近年來我嘗和朋友們討讑到目前中國敎育問題、大家皆晨肯呈短歎、認爲百病叢生、最後、我却大大的高捧補習敎育一番說、他在今日的中國、却有醫治（敎育病）效能、值得大家來提倡我曾記得我有一段近乎武斷的話、</p>
<p>要聞</p>
<p>蘇省</p>
<p>各縣注意敎師進修訓練</p>
<p>江蘇各縣敎育局以勵行敎育普及、亟應注意師資訓練、以冀量的擴充、與質的充實並顧計自民國十八年起、即由江蘇各縣籌備義務敎育聯合辦事處、設立師資訓練函授部一方面使不合格敎師、從事進修補習、便於參加檢定試騐、而成績優良者、亦得充任爲初級小學校長或敎員、）查各縣敎員登記不合格者有一萬一千六百七十三人超過師資額之半數）又一方而使合格敎師、因敎學相長之中、灌輸新知、增進其敎育效率、此項訓練以一年畢業頗見節省經費、而收益甚鉅、敎育部曾特予嘉許而浙江福建等省敎育廳、亦經仿照辦理、現在該部正招收第三屆學員、所有各敎學方法之講義、均查照敎育部最近訂定之新課程標準、重生編輯、因此項課程標準之編審委員、大都即係担任該部之編輯及指導員、故彼此益能銜接、各科講義都附有詳細之作業指導、及參考資料、用問答·測騐·調查·參觀、實習等方法、切實研究、凡參加學員、一律應向敎育局報名、各縣並定有補助及奬勵研究辦法、按照學區指派敎員參加、至外省各縣參加學員、報名期展延至九月底爲止云、</p>

<h3>世界小事記</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>驚人的醫費</p>
<p>暹羅王因左眼患白内障。特地由暹京朋考克　　　遠迢迢地趕往美國紐約去就醫。請一位最著名的眼科醫生給他診治。美國有五六位專門醫家。每年的入收總在十萬金鎊至十五萬金鎊之間。如今這一位給暹王醫眼的醫士。其收入也不相上下。而爲了鄭重將事起見。勢必放棄了其他的診務。專給暹王一人效力他的損失。當然須由暹王補償他。先前曾有一位大富豪。請外科名醫某氏施行手術一次。付費至五萬金鎊之多。那麽暹王所費。至少也要如此。加以日夜看護婦各二人。麻醉術專家一人助手若干人。需費約在一萬六千金鎊左右。診治的期限須二個月。租住大厦一所。約需六萬金鎊。王與后二人并扈從等一百六十人。從暹京來美往返旅費。至少須七萬金鎊。更有一切雜費日用諸費。統計定在二十五萬金鎊之譜。所以此次暹王的醫費。其鉅大實爲歷史上空前所未有。但是東方的君主。大都富有。這二十五萬金鎊的醫費。也許不以爲意吧。</p>

<p>一刹那間水深及膝。漢口近月餘來。雖亦苦雨。惟以隄工甚固。人民亦安之若素。某日淸晨。予友方赴市啜茗。歷一小時而出。即聞人云。隄潰矣。當時尙未置信。乃行不半里。見憲兵營中已有水。未幾。洪濤奔騰而至。勢不可禦。急雇車返寓。水已深數寸。但見江水内灌。瞬息尺餘。方知大禍將至。不禁相顧失色矣。</p>
<p>身葬魚腹尙在夢中漢口人民。迷戀于烟館者頗多。一般癮君子。非至淸晨。不克安眠。隄决之日。適逢昩爽。而來勢又猛。遂致有若干人民。于睡夢中爲洪濤捲去。亦云慘矣。</p>
<p>黄包車亦有頭等昔嘗于滑稽小說中。見有鄉人初游上海。乘坐黄包車時。蹲伏座位之下。謂係坐三等云云。此次漢臯水勢上漲。黄包車夫一時生涯鼎盛。其後水面愈高黄。包車下部已着水。乘客乃坐于車篷之上。謂之頭等。行時由二車夫扶推。取價極昻。而行動迂緩。亦别開生面之奇觀也。一般不顧乘頭等車者。祗可赤足步行。惟嗣後水勢繼漲。高及六七尺乃至丈餘。並頭等車亦不可坐。其苦痛可知矣。</p>
<p>小舟往來如入威尼斯黄包車絶跡後。繼之者爲小舟。在市政府登記者。凡五千餘艘。一時街道盡成河渠。但見舟楫往來。如入水城威尼斯。街道原不甚闊。舟行擁擠。時時相撞。每舟須舟子二人。方可行駛。上挿白旗。遠望極饒奇趣。</p>
<p>上樓容易下樓難當水勢愈趨愈高。平房居民。已不能安居。紛紛遷入漢口最著名之五層樓某大旅店舍。方期可禦水魔。不幸於日前又告傾圯。淹斃數百人。于是人民又惴惴不敢登樓。顧平房水深尋丈。又不能安寢。進退維谷。其窘狀可以想見</p>
<p>自樓窗上傾糞水災泛濫後。市民食糧問題。固發生種種困難。然排洩尿糞。亦苦無從。市政府于每日派舟至各處收糞。居民自樓窗上下傾。多半排流水内。或則竟淋及舟子漢身。街道水渠。旣如是不潔。加之尸身剽海。日久遂成惡臭。陽光愈烈。愈不堪向邇。漢臯人民。眞如處十八層地獄也。</p>
<p>嗷嗷待哺之災民平漢鐵路地勢較高。災民咸恃此爲棲息地。惟日來已岌岌可危。災民呼號之聲。慘不忍聞。現每日由救濟會派舟分散　包。然粥少僧多。終無濟于事。設再無退水方策。人民將同歸于盡矣。市上除米店不准休業。勉强開市外。餘均宣告停頓。</p>
<p>武昌亦成巨浸當漢口江水入城之日。武昌尙告無事。故救濟會曾將一部分災民。移至武昌暫住。乃未幾武昌之隄岸亦决。遂至無法可施。各輪船碼頭已不可復見。恃甲划登輪。輪中擁擠萬狀。予友狼狽歸來。覓一席地而不可得。所幸外商輪船公司。尙存天良。未曾加價云。</p>
<p>水利不修致酿巨變漢口對於隄工。原有專欵辦理。比年負責人員。一味因循。遂致一發不可收拾。今雖薄有懲罰。然數千人民之犧牲。數千萬元之損失。將何所取償。鄂人對於建設廳長。將有嚴重表示云。</p>
<h3>特别潤格</h3>

<h3>造雲林故居</h3>
<p>— 李寓一</p>
<p>倪雲林先生。爲元代四大畫家之一。所居在無錫東鄉之長大夏。富於資。因爲物質之有力反抗者。其祇陀故廬。現已僅餘寺院。所建淸閟閣。昔日富藏書畫見稱海内者。亦已渺不可得。徒見桑隴稻田而已。然遺韻傳說。有足記者。</p>
<p>自來評雲林之畫。疏淡冲遠。列爲逸品。今觀其居風景。世松修竹。夾植田間。河溪溝沼。隠現林際。上而與曠闊之天空。輕渺之雲色相映。雲林之疎淡冲遠。亦即雲林之疏淡冲遠也。得乎自然。毫無疑意</p>
<p>雲林先生嗜桐。日必洗之。野叟傳言。其桐被仙人唾。故至今之桐汁黏。其故居旁有枯木如猿。鄉人因其歷久不壞。謂必有神居。</p>
<p>其前有短溪名下沼河。水質較他處重百分之二十。一如惠泉。淸澄見底。產　螺之屬。皆被絲綠毛。更前有古松二。如中大之六朝松而茂。凡此皆因先生而見稱者。</p>
<p>其居農皆倪姓。都數百家。宅式無論貧富。皆三進屋中建廣廳廳。上十九有節孝扁額。且二三方不以爲奇。婦女守節風盛。亦一異事。</p>
<p>余因廠美藝鑑赏社作工處於至友倪小遷先生家。見彼廳之額亦有二方。蓋其先祖之守節者已二代矣。此可推知其地女子多於男子而健。吾國傳說。富則多生女。貧則多生男。證以今日統計研究。亦確鑿不移。其地之多女者。亦正以其地之富庶。稻麥雜穀外。益以蠶桑之利。蠶可春秋二季。時正秋蠶。老稚各有所職。守節婦女。集其心力於此。生活裕無復他思。且守節而善。可减生育。有裨益於人口問題。亙千數百年倪姓數百家。無人满爲患。可爲左證。至雲林之畫。得乎自然者。不徒於風景之感召。</p>
<p>其優裕生活。衣食足而後知藝事。亦最大造因也。或以爲藝事之精從堅固精神中得來者。得勿以此爲妄乎。</p>
<h3>印度遊記（九三）</h3>
<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>凡一切小陔育於母懷。長於母手。在胎中即有聖靈之長育。長大時時受其覆護。成第二天性。甚矣女性之難以離神穫。即世間宗敎未易撲滅也。觀於恒河之水。回憶楞嚴經波斯王對佛言。我憶三歲慈母携我謁耆婆天。見恒河水者。乃證實印人之育於神懷。故報母恩念甚重也自恒河回。沿途婦女抱小孩者甚多。均點兒額以五采。爲受洗於聖水紀念。</p>
<p>過許多小廟。均有女人守之。香客來打　。給以錢。不知爲女尼與否。但以吾所知。世界有三不可抗力。一强權。二金錢。三兩性愛均難抵抗。印度敎雖極窮高極遠。而其僧人或私生子或返俗或愛懋之案。屡見之仍須律師解决。各廟均有僧人。亦有女人。問之則其弟子也。但事實上有許多案件發生。余遍觀宗敎史。而知談理太高。不合人生。未有不失敗者。此出家制之所以爲例外。而難以爲常道也。經過一大公園。結構壯麗。花草頗好。</p>
<p>是日下午五時在Anglo-Bengalee　Mtermediate　College　Allahubad阿拉哈巴兩省聯合大學講。副校長阿敦那Mr.　Asthana爲主席聽者不過百人。蓋印度地方。大會數千乃至萬人。甚平常也。以此證明佛經說法與萬八千弟予俱在。中國人以爲妄誕。在印度此等大會。猶常見之也。印人之好學愛智。不愧爲第一大師。冠於世界也。此日聽者不多。乃因講會事發生於臨時前三點鐘。學生均散學於元旦。而又值本日爲閉市日。甘地之徒正爲國民大運動也。阿敦那爲本省名人。有諸學生問余。問題甚多。余告之。均可了解。其好學可佩服也。余講未畢。户外街上甘地之徒大喊呌。游行全市。已上燈火。六時許散會。余乃隨衆人參觀甘地運動。男女魚貫而來。經一時許。手執大小印度國旗。或持木杖。或以頭頂明燈。亦有頂香者。男戴甘地帽。其帽爲白粗布。向前略尖。即中國之大布白孝帽而已。絲毫無異也。到一大公園。可容三四萬人。高聲大呼。聲淚俱下。蓋其親戚子弟。有被害於獄中者。余不懂印度語。聞其聲。至今書此。不覺代爲悲哀。女界講演尤見奮興。此阿拉哈巴一市有三萬人運動。聞全印度各大小市鎭。本日無一不爲同式之運動。亦可謂壯烈也已。印人對於甘地。即今日之生佛也。印人對我曰。英人不敢害甘地。若害甘地。則大暴動起。立可變爲共產式。若用柔化。印人尙可容忍也。</p>
<h3>東北考察隨筆（四）</h3>
<p>— 劉穗九</p>
<p>（五）文溯閣四庫全書之由來</p>
<p>乾隆巡幸時。創設文溯閣於瀋陽。收藏四庫全書。今日奉天尙得存有一部完整之四庫全書。即淸帝東巡之賜。現文賜現文溯閣之前部。爲遼寗省敎育會會址。欲參觀四庫全書。須得該會或省府之許可與介紹。予於今春偕該會副會長王化一君入内瀏覧一次。聞某公言。前歲奉天曾籌翻印四庫全書。且已印成樣本。爲洋式裝訂有歐洲國際聯盟秘書長艾文諾氏。願承銷多部。及索觀樣本。見爲洋式裝訂。爲之不樂。即直告張學良氏。謂西人不喜此種裝訂。後又加之其他緣因。此舉遂致擱置矣。</p>
<p>（六）帝王文學作品</p>
<p>淸帝巡幸瀋陽之其他副產物。則爲盛京賦。帝王文學作品也。去歲在奉天圖書中得親見乾隆製本。查乾隆御製盛京賦内容。爲漢文三十二種篆體。與满文三十二種篆體書成者。該館所藏有漢文八套三十二册。满文八套二十五册。其三十二種漢文篆體爲……</p>

<p>（七）人富有中國地圖及省縣志</p>
<p>猶憶去冬中央研究院。派梁君往熱河考古。經過奉天時。欲覓一詳細熱河地圖而不可得。同年十一月七日。予接大連圖書館漢文部長松崎鶴雄氏來函。約往參觀該館舉行之支那地圖展覧會。併寄來目錄一册。計關於中國全省縣以及窮鄉僻壤。遠至二三百年前之精要各種地圖。收藏達四百五十一種之多。此等地圖。余固於先期在大連該館得展閱之矣。又聞該館藏有全中國各省省志縣志。完整無比。又其他古本孤本圖籍甚多。往日過大連參觀該館時。館長杮沼介氏。出示該館藏書目錄厚約六英寸。當承其惠贈已經印成之目錄第一第二兩册。零售第本須日金二元左右。聞尙有不公開之書目云。</p>

<p>新閘昨日各路來貨不多、因天時晴正、本街走銷呆懈、厚粳頂中二檔均疲七角、買氣極淡、市上人心均看回低、薄稻貨雖有限、况去路不佳、價亦回落一元零、變陰元因粳米旺到、故趨勢下游、影響新粳及洋尖、價無漲跌、蘆尖埠尖明定暗萎、洋米到積漸薄、客帮動辦、價續带軟二三角、</p>
<h3>小絞新定三千噸</h3>
<p>回籠貨成交一千噸…北帮辦裝客元米　　昨日洋米現貨交易停頓、而期貨則甚活動、現貨因存底不多、貨主喊大、而進户以粉麥下跌、擬撳小再辦、故無交易、期貨有達豐售出回籠貨一千噸、爲九月份小絞、價六兩五錢二分、原係太和洋行抛出者、洋米新交易則有十一月份小絞三千噸、即係前日祥茂打出電報之覆電轉准也、此批成交後、市上人心略見回軟云、</p>
<h3>期麥晨跌午回</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份市面以千五百萬蒲式耳美麥、經國府露布、此大批洋麥確定後、人心自不免大爲動搖、本月份更以交割關係、廠家不收、最低曾跌至三兩七錢九月份至三兩九錢四分、十月份至四兩零三分、十一月份至四兩零七分、十二月份至四兩一錢一分、一月份至四兩一錢四分、較前日又跌三四五六分不等、迨至下午開盤、以外行空頭抵補頗殷、兼因粉市之回振、遠期各月份带振三四分不等、至木月份之交割數量、聞已扞樣者達一百餘車、如行家不自行軋去、當達二百車也、（聞祥新收五十車、申大收二十餘車、新豐收二三十車）、結果本月份較前日反好二分、九月份好一分、十月份不動、十一月份小一分、十二月份小二分、一月份不動、現麥因廠家無意、一無見交云、</p>
<h3>標粉受美麥影響</h3>
<p>後市補空稍回</p>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市面、因美麥賑飢之一千五百萬蒲式耳、國府已經通過、此種消息、一經露布、人心自然大爲震動、蓋賑災旣有巨大之美來爲準備、自無缺糧之可虞、多頭方面彷彿失一保障、故買氣暢盛、廠家又有抛壓、因此本月份最低至二兩零七分七厘半、九月份至二兩零八分七厘半、十月份至二兩一錢零七厘半、其餘月份、亦均低落、平均跌度、又達二三分不等、迨至下午開盤、初仍平疲、旋因補空甚急、實銷帮亦略有吸進、市氣略覺穩定、但以大勢言、此種大跌小回、仍非佳兆也、結果本月份小五釐、九·十月份小一分、十一月份小一分二釐半、十二月份小一分、一月份小一分半云、</p>
<p>糖市劃盤交靜市平</p>
<p>組砂白略見轉挺</p>
<p>昨日糖市產區電訊、古巴現糖價爲一·四三七五、紐約期糖九月及十二月份價均一·三一、明年五月份一·三五、九月份一·四一、比前電均回跌三分至七分不等、爪哇現期糖仍乏升降、公會市場劃盤交易殊寥、但市氣略定、荷糖二十四號粗砂白新貨成交價升十一兩六錢半、市形尙堅、二十號中砂白十一兩、要手不多、太古糖進出亦屬凋零、B嘜十二兩零二分半、DY嘜十一兩八錢二分半、HX嘜十一兩七錢半、HM嘜十一兩四錢、○嘜九兩四錢、趨勢則平、華新兜CW嘜十一兩九錢、殊少問津、陳貨油袋粗砂白略有售出、額僅數百袋、價爲十一兩四錢半、行方進意淡薄市形亦萎而無神云、</p>
<p>南北貨黑新瓜子大批踵到</p>
<p>市勢反緊</p>
<p>新黑瓜子前批曾有少數運到、計江西子開十六兩、天津子十七兩、兹聞鎭帮什糧帮各號到有大批新徐魁子一千二百包、因索　過高、未能成盤、行號雙方正在相持中、惟天津子亦有二千包可以　到市象難望回　、蓋今庚以水患關係、各產區以數收居多人心向上、勢必　人堅緊之進、可斷言也、</p>
<p>絲茶日商續購滬廠經</p>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊絲市、仍無轉機、查歐美市塲日絲開價仍廉、與滬白廠經相懸二百餘兩、絲電不轉、昨祇日莊繼起補空、計三井等進滬白廠經四十包、達昌等進白乾經二十包、價仍堅挻云、</p>
<h3>無錫白絲頭運滬不弱</h3>
<p>長吐繭衣湯繭等運到一百八十件</p>
<p>無錫絲廠四十八家、現計開工者已達四十家、絲頭產額較增、兹以月底將屆、各廠商承抛各洋行之絲頭亟須依期交解、昨日滬錫客車裝到絲廠長吐繭衣湯繭等一百八十件、預備交解云、</p>
<h3>婺源珍眉歐銷轉暢</h3>
<p>昨本埠洋莊茶市、婺源高莊珍眉綠茶、協各永興保昌杜德等行、均起動辦、市面轉趨暢達、屯溪珍眉、錦隆洋行、亦略有淮胃、市盤一百五六十兩、頗爲堅硬、其餘貢熙針眉秀眉等項、亦均活動、綠茶市勢、已臻穩固之境、祁門紅茶、怡和天祥等行、均有進胃、惟售價跌至四五十兩、華茶商頗多大受虧折云、</p>
<p>疋頭仍在疲靜過程中</p>
<p>疋市復形見軟、大有一厥不振之勢、實以各埠水災奇重、荒象已成、故客銷完全停頓中、兼之反日風雲依然緊急、東貨異常呆滞、所以日來棉布公會市場、成交寥落、爲從來所未有、昨棉布中細布復跌、藍雙魚七兩四錢、陽鶴彩球七兩三錢半、汽球七兩七錢半、惟細斜尙挺、蓋川帮染坯需要甚殷、粗布續小二分半至五分、粗斜趨勢呆頓、東貨近來祗有零星去路、小川帮及河南雲貴等處、頗有郵包運去、就中以雪花嗶嘰較多、寒山寺爲三錢二分、千里駒三錢一分半、孝順圖三錢一分七厘半、雪花色汀亦有辦去、長城騎馬陞官圖一致二錢九分半、月華絨·直貢呢·直貢緞因走勢不振、連日下落甚烈、較之上週小去五厘之譜、西貨到銷均寂、滬埠積存之素洋紗、此次被巨潮所浸、爲數頗夥云、</p>
<p>五金跌多漲少</p>
<p>市場概况近來五金交易、緣各地採辦不廣、致市場實交異常蕭條、因此各市行情、跌多漲少、蓋當此水患頻仍、商貨　滞之秋、欲求五金市之盛衆、在理勢上似難有濟、據熟悉内幕者云、欲其市况之進展、恐非等秋節過後、一時殊難見有活動氣象、</p>
<p>差强人意之五金品新鉛絲自東貨抵制後、西貨行情紛紛提加、計每擔估十三兩五錢、（十六號至二十號）而二十一號至二十五號售十九兩、十八張黑鐵皮昨因貨缺、亦漲至十一兩五錢、七厘半英鋼板昨價已漲至六兩五錢、比前又提一錢花園鉛絲貨少、價已漲至五兩二錢半、白鉛皮·紫銅·點錫等交易尙覺活潑、但行情除挺定外、殊無有上漲消息云、</p>
<p>頻跌不已之熱門貨馬口鐵交易甚少、而行情無振展希望、刻市雖能擯持而不落、已十分幸運矣、法西釘開價、目下現祇估八兩七錢半、然尚無受主、美白鐵受到源充塞而趨疲、刻估十八兩七錢半、交易除福建帮外、别帮無指染者、因此行情又有續小之可能、白鉛皮因銷令未到、而行情益軟、靑鉛自土鉛湧到後、市更不振、價估十五兩七錢半、受主十分寥少、而其他新洋元·竹節鋼·新鐵絲等無一不在衰疲訊中云、</p>

<h3>悼亡友陳君行叔并介紹他的思想（續）</h3>
<p>— （鶴亭寄自巴黎）</p>
<p>羣體主義是否是眞理、另是問題、我們不能在此討論、但是、單單這一番大公無私的理論的動機、已值我們欽仰、我們從他對朋友的態度上、更可見他大公無私的精神、</p>
<p>行叔是一個可親可愛的朋友、他對朋友的交誼、十分深摯、但是、他從不以私情妨碍公義、社會有許多人、以交友的目的、在互相吹嘘、在飯碗同盟、行叔對此、最痛恨、他以爲做人不應當專爲自已或自已的朋友、在满目瘡痍的中國、哀鴻遍野的中國、满目是在飢寒貧病中的同胞、社會上多少英才、多少志士、多少能努力的份子、埋没在裏面、我們何必亦何能常爲幸運份子、假使放大着眼睛在社會上、我們怎忍得、專希望自已與自已的朋友幸福、中國的壞、就壞在大家專爲朋友帮忙、不爲社會設法、</p>
<p>但是在封建社會、生長慣的中國人、祗知有私交、只知有公義、社會上所謂（英雄）（好漢）（志士）（俠客）盡是些借公濟私、貪得贓來帮助朋友、培植私黨的人物、誰知道、私人關係之上另有人一個社會、社會與公義、在他們看來、太抽象了、誰能了解得、難怪、朋友會愈多、兄弟會愈衆、私友的交誼愈發達、而社會的事業、一天壞似一天、（朋友）（同志）將變爲合夥行刧的代名詞、如行叔的不以私害公的主張、在現社會上、誰還情願顧及、</p>
<p>某日、星期、許多朋友、在一起談天消遣、提起了政治、大家照例發牢騷、嘆惜、因爲留學生的牢騷最多、使他們發牢騷的原因、亦最複雜、行叔甚不以發牢騷爲然、他說、（我們觀察社會、不必看了政潮的起落、忽悲忽喜、因爲政潮僅是社會表面的風波、並不是左右社會演化的主源、論事、須追本求源、我們須把我們的視線、改變一方面、注視在社會的根本問題、生產問題上、）</p>
<p>在此、他的主張、頗與唯物史觀相接近雖然他並不是唯史觀的信徒、他根據了社會的生產、來分析社會的亂源、他以爲中國社會失掉經濟上的平衡、農村上的生活標準、與大都市中的生活標準、相差太遠、農村的人民、在過着歐洲十六七世紀的經濟生活、大都市的人民、則已亨盡二十世紀最奢侈的物質文明、但大都市中的人物、大多祇能消費、他們不是（地主）、便是（買辦）或官僚、都是不從事直接生產、（食於人）的人物、他們都直接間接、依賴着農村上都市中貧寒飢餓没知識的小農工小商人來維持他們的生活、在如此情形下、難怪社會經濟一天破壞一天、人民生計、一天痛苦一天、失掉了穩固的經濟基礎、社會上不易有政治的安定、所以我們要求社會的穩定、一定要努力生產、</p>
<p>這是一個多麽主要的原則、從社會學目光看來、社會失掉（平衡）、使不能生存、中國社會上、從各方面看來、都已失掉平衡、都在（衝突）（矛盾）中、在經濟方面、有農村經濟與都市經濟的不平衡、有消費最與生產量的不平衡、又有直接生產者與間接生產者分配的不匀、在道德思想方面、則又有新舊文化東西文化的衝突、别論社會、就是個人的思想行爲當然一部分是社會的反影莫不在衝突、矛盾、紊亂中、所以、政治的紊亂、自有他主要原因、我們徒嘆惜唏嘘、有何用處、行叔才算了解中國社會的病源了、</p>
<p>我們要談到他的職業主張了、他是留學生中的佼佼者、他照例好做一個學者敎授、并且是有名的、但是他時時對人說、他頗不願做敎授與學者、因爲這不是現社會上最最急需的事業、他很想經營一個小實業、朋友們聽了、常常笑他幻想、但是這確是他很認眞的主張、因爲他家住在山麓、他曾想了不少墾植山地的方法、擬了不少提倡栽種果樹的計劃、　　假使我們以他的話、是東方式的隱士觀念、我們便差誤了、行叔是一個積極的份子、至少在他的思想、因爲他尙未行動、他不是厭世、更不是求個人生活的安康與瀟灑、他目覩著社會的需要、在提倡生產、所以他自已情願爲前驅、去實行生產事業、大實業不成、便努力小職業、</p>
<p>幾千年來的重士觀念、（勞心者役人、勞力者役於人）的觀念、使中國人把（讀書）（學者）（學問）和（文化）諸名詞、看得太神秘了、誰又知道、文化與學問、不過是增加生活幸福的工具其本身、並無價值、從行叔的職業主張上、我們可知道、他的思想、早已完全脫了（士大夫）的臭氣、行叔如不早死、他的主張、能否實現、當然是一大問題、但是他能如此主張、已經不是一個人云亦云的學者了、</p>
<p>中華民族、假使不從此淪亡、在最近的將來、一定有許多志士靑年、丢棄了書本、離了纯理論的實騐室、爭向着生產的路上去跑、現社會的演進趨勢、已在壓迫我們、使我們不得不如此去跑了、行叔這一番理論、的確是切乎實際的理論、是現社會需要的產物、</p>
<p>我把行叔的主要思想、介紹給大家、我並未添油加醬、我並不來爲死朋友捧塲、這僅是我與行叔、在這半年來、自他由德國回法後、許多次深夜長談的一部分記錄、只可惜我的筆太笨心太粗、我的性情又與行叔不同、我的記述中、與他所談的大意、並無多大出入、但是在口氣上、和措辭上、一定有許多懸殊、這是我自已覺得十分不满意的地方、不過、亦没奈何、嚴格的說、一個人的思想、别人本不能代述、</p>
<p>行叔的可記念之處、實在太多了、他的一切、都值得我們紀念、不過、我不得不暫時擱筆了、說下去、總不能完、並且總太悽慘、</p>
<p>自然和社會都未嘗合理化、自然界中、有多少鮮妍的花卉、正在盛開時、便遇着狂風的摧折、社會上、有多少聰明分子、努力分子、因爲無適當環境的栽培、便永永埋没、自然旣給了行叔先天的知慧、後天的環境、但是偏偏又奪掉他身體的健康、這眞是天地的不仁、我並不爲行叔嘆惜、生死、本有什麽分别、我祇是爲社會嘆惜、</p>
<p>記者按、陳君行叔爲光華大學發起人之一、曾任光華大學敎職、民國十六年赴法、進巴黎大學、研習政治經濟、今年暑期可得博士學位、不料竟患腹膜炎、于五月三日、病殁巴黎、現陳君友人何炳松潘公展等、定本月三十日、在法租界亞爾培路西愛咸斯路南中國科學社、開會追悼、</p>
<h3>林白家境及其幼年生活</h3>
<p>— 袁葆康</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>一千九百零二年二月四號、余生於美國密希根省地屈勞城、時余父正執行律師職務於明南司大之立特福斯處、余生後未满二月、余父即携余去密西西比河畔之農塲、此地離立特社斯祇二里許、</p>
<p>余父爲林白查利、（按美國父子同名者極多、祇須於名後加一（大）或（小）而已、）生於一千八百六十年一月二十日瑞典國之司大克好姆城、余祖父爲門新矣拉、　　　　　　　（自遷美後始改姓林白）曾任國會議員、及皇帝秘書等要職於瑞典國、</p>
<p>一千八百六十年、余祖父率其眷屬、乘輪離瑞來美、旋即築宅於掃克、與明南司大城相鄰、余父之幼年生活即度於此、</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>時明而司大鮮有學校之設立、故余父之幼年時代、多費於獵釣等事上、關於敎育則多半受之於家中、偶然間或能進鄉村學校、而總未有讀满一學期者、</p>
<p>當其正式受敎育時尙爲肄讀於明南司大城之格羅府湖中學、畢業後、考入密希根大學、法學士學位亦即得之於此、　　大學畢業後、旋即返至立特福斯、行使律師職務、但不久其又轉心政治、於一千九百零六年、第十次國會、余父竟被選爲明南司大第六區之代表、派赴華盛頓出席、先後共任此職歷十年之久、</p>
<p>余母爲英籍、而生於地屈勞城、亦卒業於密希根大學、得理學學士、後又於哥侖比亞大學得碩士學位、余外祖父爲蘭特查耳斯、　　　　　乃地屈勞城之一牙醫也、生於加拿大之新口、余之外曾祖父、爲蘭特約翰、自英遷加、且爲開創漢密耳登城者之一人、</p>
<p>余外祖父專心研究牙科、終日工作於實騐室中、忙碌異常、對於牙科確有極大之供獻、如金牙之鑲嵌等、並爲磁質牙之首先發明及鑲用者、故衆人多皆喚其爲磁牙之鼻祖、諒此榮號亦係苦中得來者、</p>
<p>余四歲前居住明南司大城中、除至地屈勞城外、並未再有他處之遠行、自余父被選後、吾家址遂亦有二焉、冬日則度於華盛頓、夏日仍返明南司大、地屈勞遂亦爲余等常經之地矣、</p>
<p>八歲時、余入華盛頓之福爾斯學校、因吾等行止無定、致涉及余之肄讀、因之從未得讀满一學年、</p>
<p>於此時期中余嘗作長途之旅行、横渡美洲凡二次、及去巴拿馬一次、而此等長途有趣之旅行、總未能附我慾望、蓋余係一極好旅行者也、</p>
<p>學校中余最嗜好者、莫如機械、余自立特幅斯中學畢業後、遂决學習機械、二年後、轉入買迪生城威司康新大學機械工程學院、</p>
<p>余此後旋注意及航空、余首次觀瞻飛機、尙於華盛頓時爲一千九百十二年、此後我心即爲之蠱惑、於一千九百二十二年、入一航空學校、雖日處飛機叢中、而始終未能使余满意、蓋自覺與飛機接觸之時尤嫌太少也、</p>
<p>四</p>
<p>大學功課之忙碌、致余時感頭痛症、不得已輒讀之於户外、俾得免去頭痛之苦也、</p>
<p>第一暑暇時、余去坎他基之砲兵學校、約住二星期後、遂籌得洋四十元乘一機車出發往福老利大、當吾抵捷克生費耳後並未過度、即於當日、乘原車另覓他路而返、十七日後、始拆買迪生、機車已損壞、囊中之餘銀九元矣、余於買迪生稍事休息、而機車則大加修理、待其畢、遂又取道返立特福斯、度剩餘之假期、</p>
<p>第三學期、余决定學航空、並定此即吾學生所應抱之方針、故未待此學期終了、約三月中旬（一九二二年）余决然離買迪生而赴林肯、入尼不類司克航空敎練所、及此、余之夙願可謂已達到矣、當余離校時、他人多嘖嘖不已、以余年少年無謀、棄正歸邪而隗時思之、有今日之成功者尙全基於當時毅然之一舉也、</p>
<p>譯者按、林白夫婦作飛行遠東之舉、時下已將抵東京、我國政界亦已籌備歡迎大會、張副司令今亦願將其私自福特大機供彼游覧中國之需、故於其未抵國前、介紹其歷史於此、</p>

<h3>一個婦人的供狀</h3>
<p>— 徐梗生</p>
<p>一個婦人的供狀徐梗生</p>
<p>以淸新明快的畫筆、輪廓地、輕捷地、而又富有纖麗穠郁的色素、以描繪近代都市婦女的生活、思想、舉動、爲其大部份創作的基礎、周樂山是獲得了可驚的成功、</p>
<p>（一個婦人的供狀）裏、一共包括短篇小說十五篇、中篇小說一篇、即一個婦人的供狀、這篇可以算是本集子裏的代表作、因爲從這篇裏面最可以看出作者的作風、（那筆致簡潔、使人大爲感動的作風、）傳彥長君序語、</p>
<p>所謂一個婦人的供狀、就是描寫一個婦人在未死以前的懺悔狀、這個婦人、曾嫁過七個丈夫、曾流浪過大連、南洋、吉隆坡、巴黎、及上海等有名的都市、曾　童養媳（毛了頭）的身份、進而爲摩登女生、舞女、賣唱者、官僚、名優、校長、富商與及律師的太太、最後則流爲娼妓、和燕子窠的主人、以這樣情節的複雜、人物的複雜、地域的廣大、風土的懸殊、作者却統同把她包括在二十八個中國頁當中、使我們讀了、覺得每一個情節、都窮形盡妙、所有的人物、都個性不同、每處地域、都如親身經過一般、這不能不認爲是作者的心靈手敏了、</p>
<p>女主人薇、是一個豪爽任性、勇於愛的　爭、而容易爲愛情所屈服、所陶醉、所傾倒的剛性的女子、我們且看她的第二個丈夫Y愛上了她的同學B女士、而把B女士（挾在脅下送她出門去）的時候、我們的作者、寫她對於愛的　爭的情態的文字說、</p>
<p>（我那時想自殺、又想復仇、自殺、復仇、我想了一夜、最後决定、自殺是弱者的行爲、我决定復仇、</p>
<p>自抱定了復仇主義之後、我的行徑和以前完全不同了、我在外面的社交行動、一切都對Y守秘密、我那時期待得Y特别的好、Y也漸漸的從新死心塌地的愛我了、有一夜、他自動的向我懺悔以前的罪過、他說、不知道爲什麽一時蒙蔽了良心、被B引誘着了、</p>
<p>他要我原恕他、我装做不理會這一回事、微笑着說、</p>
<p>一這算一回事嗎、靑年人都常常有的、</p>
<p>我於是進行我的復仇計劃、</p>
<p>我開始向Y的一個好朋友陳不同進攻…）</p>
<p>我們又看學描冩她豪爽任性的地方吧、這是她和第三個丈夫陳不同離婚的一幕、</p>
<p>（你爲什麽不得我的同意、來做唱戲的勾當、</p>
<p>我冷然地答他道、</p>
<p>你能管着我嗎、演劇是一種不正當的事業嗎、</p>
<p>我今天無論如何不准你上臺、</p>
<p>我偏要上臺去、看你怎麽樣、</p>
<p>他的脸靑了、大聲地喝道、</p>
<p>你不聽我的話、那我們從此斷絶關係、</p>
<p>眞的嗎、</p>
<p>誰和你開頑笑、我是不要一個如你這般不聽約束的女子的、</p>
<p>那再好没有了、在我的戲散塲之後、在陸律師處相見、）</p>
<p>再看看他寫她爲愛情所屈服、所陶醉、所傾倒的情態、這是她同英白衣在大連的同居生活、</p>
<p>（我在那時、才得着了人間眞正的愛、我始相信、（愛是無條件的）這名話是可以成立的、）</p>
<p>在那時、我有什麽希求呢、我只希望我和白衣的美满生活永遠的繼續下去、以至於無窮、）</p>
<p>至於篇中的幾個男性的個性、也各自顯然不同、薇的哥哥、是一個沈毅而有决斷的人、Y是一個愛情容易浮浪的靑年、陳不同是一個銅臭商人、他的眼中、什麽都商品化、同時女人也商品化、吳白衣是一壯健的男性、同時忠於女性的肉的迷戀者、姚義成是一個長厚的商人、因而也是一個懦弱的丈夫、黄訪是女性男子、一個没有决斷的定命論者、陳一鷗是一個陰險家、夏微音是一個瀟灑的藝術家C君是一個富有科學頭腦的沉默的法律家、以上一干人的性情雖然各不相同、然而作却没有從正面去刻意描寫、他祗是旁敲側撃、從各方面淡淡地、不經意地、烘托出來、除了描寫C君的性格以外、這也是作者富有藝術素飬的表現、</p>
<p>此外要談談他的寫景的手腕了、我在這裏提出他寫巴黎的一段、巴黎是世界物質生活高度化的名都、但如果你先從物質上着眼、則任你寫得如何（金迷紙醉、）却不能顯出巴黎的特色、却不能顯出活的新鮮的巴黎、作者似乎看到了這一點、所以特地抽出巴黎的近郊來寫、抽出巴黎的秋來寫、又從秋中而又抽出紅葉來寫、於是巴黎近郊紅葉秋、寫來便何等具體、何等生動、何等的幽默而富有詩趣、現在且把她引在下面、</p>
<p>（我到巴黎的時候、剛是秋天、巴黎的秋是再美麗不過的、你往巴黎近郊去一望、遍山遍野的紅葉、紅得愛人、那時郊外比城裏熱閙多了、時髦的婦女多夾着她的情人駕着輕便的小汽車、往近逛去、那種時髦的裝束、可說是人人不一樣、令人暗暗的呌聲（好、）</p>
<p>加之、紅葉實在紅得醉人、有許多人坐在满生着紅葉的山峯下喝酒、喝得臉紅的和紅葉一色了、我愛巴黎、醉人的巴黎呵、）</p>
<p>以上是我對於一個婦人的供狀的讀後的印象、</p>
<p>其餘各篇、除了（都市幻想曲）是另種象徵的筆調、爲在作者的作品中不經見外、都有一個共同之點、就是能於平鋪直叙之中而包藏一種深沉的悲哀、就是造句遣辭、没有斧鑿的痕跡、作者是一個多產的作家、兩年之間、創作集問世的有四部、兒童文學有八部、眞如作者自已所說、（我若在上海再獃下去、怕要著作等身了、）但是在他作品中的致的色素不經意、不矯揉造作、富有如閑雲野鶴般的閒曠的美、却是隨處都可以發現着的、總之、這些作品不是做出來的小說、而是寫出來的小說、這也許就是他的特色之一吧、</p>

<p>如此、德軍七月十五日攻勢戰失敗之後、聯軍急行乘機反攻、大捷、七月廿四日的計劃書中的目標現在盡行達到了　　七月十八日、後備集團軍（第六第十軍）在愛斯南河與馬爾納河間進攻、不久、中部集團軍（第九第五軍）繼之在馬爾納河與凡斯爾河間前進、三星期之内、敵軍被撃退至凡斯爾河、巴黎歇龍鐵路綫遂告肅淸、</p>

<p>(Yangzhou) On the morning of the 26th, a northwest wind howled, and Hongze and Gaoshaohu Lakes surged, with waves battering the eastern dike of Shaobo. At noon, fifteen breaches occurred from the south of the Nanda Wang Temple to the Six Gates and the south of the North Ban Factory.

Five small vessels and ten tugboats were dispatched on the evening of the 27th, carrying cash, dry rations, and reed mats to rush to the rescue. Provincial Commissioner Li Mingyang led a company of soldiers in advance. The provincial government prepared 10,000 cash, half of which was used to purchase dry rations, which were also loaded. However, there are few ships and many people, and disaster victims cannot be rescued without requisitioning small boats from other ports. In addition to preparing grain and attaching it to vessels for relief, Yangzhou has also set up a disaster victim reception center. Moreover, the Ma Jiagang Dike on the north bank of the Yangtze River in Zhenjiang is in danger, and efforts are still underway to reinforce it. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Conditions for American Wheat Loan to China</h3>
<p>Our Country Still Considering</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Our country is borrowing 15 million English pounds of American wheat. The State Council has approved it in principle.

The US side has informally put forward conditions: (1) The repayment period should be divided into several installments; (2) The standard for the minimum interest rate; (3) The standard rate for the gold unit of pricing, whether to pay the money at a certain time, that is, according to the gold price at a certain time, or use a specified gold price standard rate; (4) The procedures and guarantees for China's payment. How our country should respond to and negotiate this matter is still under detailed consideration. Once there is a concrete result, it will be submitted to the meeting for approval and officially reply to the United States. After both parties agree, a contract will be signed.

<h3>Two Types of Taxes on the Banking Industry</h3>
<p>To Be Levied Simultaneously</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the promulgation of the Regulations on Bank Income Tax and Exchange Coupon Issuance Tax, the Shanghai Banking Association requested exemption. After the Ministry of Finance explained, the Banking Association requested equal treatment for both Chinese and foreign banks, but it is feared that this is difficult to handle. This time, when Finance Minister Song stayed in Shanghai, he contacted important banking figures. As a result of Zhang Shouyong's explanation, the banking community has agreed to accept tax coupons. At the same time, because the income tax is levied on the net income, starting from 5% to 15%, according to commercial practice, the profits of the branch and the head office are merged into the head office for final accounts, and the branch is not taxed. As for the banknote issuance tax, it is levied at 2.5% of the reserve. It is heard that the two taxes will be levied simultaneously from the current accounting year. According to financial circles' investigations, the private banks currently issuing banknotes include Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Central South Bank, Bao Ye Bank, Si Ming Bank, China &amp; South Sea Bank, and Industrial Bank. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance Revises</p>
<h3>Henan Business Tax Regulations</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance, based on the Henan Provincial Finance Director Wan Wu, formulated the Business Tax Regulations and Implementation Rules, clarifying that the issue of pure income of various merchants cannot be correctly resolved in a short period of time, and hasty actions may hinder progress. Therefore, this tax standard is not adopted for the time being. Article 2 states that the term "business" refers to all businesses with the purpose of making profits, but agriculture is not included. Article 5 states that the tax standards for business tax in this province are limited to two types: total business income and business capital, with each industry limited to one type, and stipulates the scope of exemption from business tax and the types and standards of taxation. The full text contains a total of 34 articles, with two copies of the tax rate schedule. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Zhang Xueliang</p>
<h3>Convenes Meeting of Various Generals</h3>
<p>Discussing the Issue of Yan and Feng Going Abroad</p>

<p>(Beiping) Xu Yongchang and Yang Aiyuan have visited Zhang Xueliang several times to discuss the issue of Yan and Feng going abroad. Zhang Ji, Wu Tiecheng, Han Fuqu, Jiang Bocheng, and others have also exchanged opinions in recent days. Generally, they all hope that Yan and Feng will go abroad. Jiang and Zhang especially hope that Yan and Feng will leave Shanxi as soon as possible so that they can forward their requests to the central government, grant them nominal travel expenses, and guarantee their safety. However, without Yan and Feng going abroad, public order in North China cannot be stabilized. This afternoon, Zhang Xueliang summoned Xu Yongchang, Yang Aiyuan, and other generals to have a concrete discussion on this matter. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Han Fuqu told reporters that the generals in the Northeast are simply exchanging opinions on the matter of Yan and Feng going abroad and there are no concrete measures yet. The Deputy Commander is urgently seeking to resolve this issue and is scheduled to convene a meeting of cadres and generals tonight or tomorrow morning to discuss concrete measures. Before Xu Yongchang came to Beiping, Yan had expressed to Xu that he would not go abroad for the time being and asked Xu to guarantee it. Xu told me Yan's intentions after arriving in Beiping and asked me to guarantee it. I believe that everything is impossible without Yan and Feng going abroad, so Xu dared not readily agree to guarantee it. I trust Xu personally very much, but I believe that if public order in North China is to be consolidated, there must be a solution for Yan and Feng to go abroad. I will leave Beiping only after the issue of Yan and Feng going abroad is resolved, or I will go to Bian with Zhang Fang. Han attended a welcome meeting for representatives of chambers of commerce from various counties in Hebei this afternoon and gave a speech. (27th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Two Major Annual Meetings of the Chinese Academic Community Recently (I)</h3>
<p>Chinese Science Society and Chinese Agricultural Society</p>
<p>Recently, there have been two major annual meetings in the Chinese academic community. One is the 16th annual meeting of the Chinese Science Society held in Zhenjiang, and the other is the 14th annual meeting of the Chinese Agricultural Society held in Beiping. The Chinese Science Society has a biological research institute and a science library, and its work is quite diligent. In recent years, it has made many contributions. The Chinese Agricultural Society was established in the fifth year of the Republic of China, and scholars from the agricultural community in various provinces have mostly participated, making it an important domestic organization for agricultural research. At a time when floods are rampant and the people of our country are suffering from the persecution of nature, the Science Society and the Agricultural Society have held annual meetings one after another amidst the sounds of floods. We feel that they are worthy of attention. The reporter would like to express his infinite hopes and sincere wishes.</p>
<p>Our country is founded on agriculture and has always valued spiritual civilization. Because it is founded on agriculture, the progress and decline of agriculture are the key to the survival of our country. Because it values spiritual civilization, it often engages in ideological and behavioral Boxer movements against the progress of science in the world. The saying of the Qing Dynasty that "Chinese learning is the foundation, Western learning is the application" and the recent revivalist movements that are trying to make a comeback have caused the development of science in our country to lag far behind European and American countries. Even in this flood, the lesson learned by the general public is not that human power has not been exhausted, that science has not been developed, or how to use hands and brains to overcome nature and overcome matter in the future, but that "Heaven is not compassionate," that "Heaven sends down misfortune," that "Heaven is enraged," or even that "the Golden Dragon King is doing mischief" and "the Water God is showing off his power." In short, what the people can recognize about the flood is only an unavoidable natural disaster and an unrecoverable strange water. Therefore, when the water comes, they can only call on Heaven and wait for death. After the water recedes, they can only flee the famine and beg. All sectors of Hankou held prayers for the flood and called on the spirits in Heaven, and it is heard that local officials also participated. With such backward scientific knowledge among the people of the country, how can the agriculture that it relies on for its foundation not decline? How can the country not be plagued by poverty and chaos? How can the people not be displaced and homeless, with no food to eat when alive and no burial place when dead? In terms of this phenomenon, the responsibility borne by the Agricultural Society is so great, and the responsibility borne by the Science Society is even greater.</p>
<p>The reason why humans are superior to animals is that humans can create and use tools. We try to look back at the trajectory of human culture, from eating raw meat and drinking blood, living in caves, and using the Stone Age after history to the modern age of cultural prosperity, from the age of worshiping nature to the modern age of conquering nature and utilizing nature. All of this accumulation of culture is the trajectory of scientific progress. Therefore, the true meaning of science is that humans create and use material tools with their brains and hands to supply and meet their needs for survival, and strive to make the time, materials, and manpower used reach the most economical level. Human society has had its science since the beginning of history, and it did not begin in the modern age of the twentieth century.</p>
<p>Humanity's attitude toward the unknown things of experiential nature: The first step is surprise, that is, to be surprised by what this new thing is. Then comes curiosity, that is, to doubt where this new thing comes from. Then comes utilization, that is, to begin to experience what this new thing is used for. In the book of human knowledge, the punctuation marks for each new page are, first, "!", then "?," and finally traces of use. Therefore, our country is not without science. However, agriculture inherits its old agricultural methods and technologies, and industry inherits its old household industry and handicraft methods and technologies. All thoughts and actions have become things of the past in Europe and the United States, while we are preserving them and not changing them. We are casting surprised eyes on the fresh things created in European and American countries, and exclaiming "Ah!" We are casting suspicious eyes and coldly exclaiming "Eh?" We regard human efforts to treat natural disasters as impossible, and we regard chemical methods of making food as myths. Try to take the motor cars that are running on the remote countryside of European and American countries today, the motor boats that are running on the water, and the various machines in agriculture and industry, and present them to the farmers who account for more than 80% of the country's population. Are there any who would not be surprised by strange things and monsters and run away in fear? People are increasingly moving towards the realm of happiness, but we are still inevitably subjected to various natural persecutions such as floods, droughts, epidemics, and diseases. "Survival of the fittest." The people of the country should all work hard, and the gentlemen of the Agricultural Society and the Science Society should strive to catch up as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Important Foreign Telegrams</p>
<h3>Coup d'état in Lisbon</h3>
<p>Armed civilians occupy artillery barracks</p>
<p>Quickly recovered by the Republican Guard</p>
<p>The rebels have failed</p>
<p>Order is fully restored</p>
<p>Reuters, Lisbon, 26th: A coup d'état occurred in Lisbon this morning at six o'clock, but it was unsuccessful. Civilians, armed with machine guns and rifles, stormed the barracks of the Third Artillery Regiment, occupied it without resistance, detained officers, and lured soldiers to join the rebellion. However, soldiers who did not join the rebellion, together with the police and the Republican Guard, soon attacked the artillery barracks. The rebels, led by Diaz, surrendered their weapons after a brief resistance. There was no unrest elsewhere in Lisbon. Armed vehicles and the Republican Guard are patrolling the streets with machine guns. The Portuguese government now claims that the entire territory is peaceful.</p>
<p>Reuters, Seville, 26th: This afternoon, a plane suddenly arrived over the Spanish city of Seville and landed outside the city. It was found to be from Portugal, with bullet marks on the plane. There were two people on board, one a civilian aviator and the other an armed mechanic. The two claimed that the coup in Lisbon this morning had failed, and they had escaped by plane. When fleeing towards Seville, they threw bombs at the Belém Palace, but it is unknown whether they had any effect.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Lisbon, 26th: At 7:30 this morning, a sudden rebellion broke out in Lisbon. Armed civilians issued a declaration against the dictatorial president and attacked two garrisons, overcoming them. The government immediately mobilized troops to attack, finally using machine guns and artillery to bombard them. Airplanes dropped bombs. From morning until 5 PM, the rebels were dispersed. When things were urgent, the cabinet meeting moved to the Republican Guard headquarters. Postal and telecommunications services were all censored. According to a government announcement at 1 AM, the rebellion resulted in 40 deaths, 265 injuries, and the arrest of 250 rebels. Several of their leaders have been captured. The president declared that order would soon be fully restored.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Madrid, 26th: According to news from the Portuguese border, an armed revolution has broken out in the capital, Lisbon. All communication between Lisbon and other places has been cut off. This news has been indirectly confirmed, but detailed information is still unavailable this evening. Rumors claim that Portuguese President Carmona has been seriously injured by the rebels, or even killed. Initial reports suggest that the revolution has been successful. According to wireless communications received here, a portion of the Portuguese naval fleet appears to have joined the revolution.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Lisbon, 27th: Order in Lisbon has been fully restored this morning after an 18-hour rebellion. This incident was caused by a sudden mutiny by troops stationed in a barracks outside the city yesterday morning. Armed civilians joined them, and they marched into the city, attempting to occupy government agencies. Although their plan was extremely secret, the authorities had already heard about it. Upon receiving the report, they mobilized troops to resist, and at the same time strictly censored postal and telecommunications services. As a result, street battles broke out in various places. At one point, the rebels gained considerable momentum, and some government troops seemed to sympathize with them and were unwilling to fight hard. Finally, the authorities used tanks and airplanes to attack, and the rebels were overwhelmed, and they collapsed. Government troops pursued them in all directions, and the sound of gunfire continued throughout the night. The rebel leader, Antelo Miranda, was captured during the street fighting and immediately executed. A total of hundreds of rebels have been arrested. According to official reports, the unrest did not affect the rural areas.</p>
<p>New British Cabinet</p>
<h3>Holds First Meeting</h3>
<p>Policy to resolve the nation's financial difficulties</p>
<p>Appoint a special committee to study everything</p>
<p>MacDonald expresses his grievances</p>
<p>Opponents are not understanding</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 27th: The new cabinet has held its first meeting. Reuters has learned from reliable sources that the new cabinet members are unanimous in their opinions, and their discussions are focused on the most important part of the new government's policy to solve the nation's financial and economic difficulties. A special committee has been appointed to study everything. It is said that the government does not want to proceed with any controversial bills, nor does it want to raise ordinary debts in the financial market. However, a method of exchanging bonds is inevitable. The detailed text of the new government's proposal must wait until Parliament convenes on September 8 before it can be announced. However, the government plans to propose several bills that can be implemented once passed. Opponents of MacDonald in the Labour Party, because MacDonald only mentioned reducing unemployment benefits by 11% in his broadcast speech, pointed to this as the new government's only financial management method. In fact, MacDonald spoke of equal sacrifice for all. The measures he plans to take to reduce spending and increase revenue are not limited to reducing unemployment benefits alone. The content of the new government's program is now being speculated by people. It is expected that pay cuts will be one of them. Sailors, soldiers, teachers, and civil servants with slightly higher salaries will probably be subject to pay cuts. As for new taxes, it is likely that income tax, entertainment tax, and tobacco and alcohol taxes will be increased. The Consumer Association case and the electoral system improvement case proposed by the previous government, which are of a nature that could cause controversy, will definitely be shelved. MacDonald sent private letters to the Labour Party members of Parliament, explaining that his actions were entirely out of a desire to do what he believed to be right, and said that it would be easier to resign and leave, without being responsible for major decisions and avoiding the party's criticism. But what about the country? It is now predicted that the national crisis can be resolved in a few weeks. However, opponents ignored him and regarded it as sarcasm. It is expected that there will be a great disturbance in Parliament on September 8. Those who previously supported MacDonald will now turn to attack him. MacDonald's separation from his old comrades is of course not without feeling. The first speech he delivers in the temporary Parliament in the capacity of the leader of the new government is worthy of attention. The General Council of Trade Unions, the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party, and the Advisory Committee of Members of Parliament held a joint meeting yesterday, unanimously deciding to oppose the new government inside and outside Parliament with the national labor movement, and advocating that the Labour Party members of Parliament should immediately form a formal opposition party. General trade union experts are now beginning to work to formulate policies to replace the 10% reduction in unemployment benefits. The plan is to heavily tax income, taxing 10% of all income below £250, and increasing the tax for those earning over £250.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 27th: The new government has appointed the Marquis of Crewe as Secretary of State for War. This position does not carry a cabinet title, which is unprecedented in British history. Crewe is a Liberal, 71 years old, the same age as Geddes. He served as a cabinet member in 1905, holding the positions of Secretary of State for the Colonies, Secretary of State for India, and Secretary of State for Education, and also served as Lord President of the Council, Lord Privy Seal, and Ambassador to France. He resigned in 1928. He is a writer and poet.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 27th: Prime Minister MacDonald's son, also a member of Parliament, has now decided to support the new government.</p>
<p>Italian Trial Performance</p>
<h3>Defending against Sky Raids</h3>
<p>900 aircraft participated</p>
<p>Italian King and Prime Minister personally reviewed the exercise</p>
<p>National News Agency, Rome, 27th: At 2:20 this morning, Italy held the world's largest air force exercise, with 900 aircraft participating. Italian King, Prime Minister Mussolini, and Minister of Aviation Balbo personally reviewed the exercise. A trial attack on Spezia was conducted first. The purpose of this exercise was to test Italy's ability to defend against sky raids.</p>
<h3>Hamaguchi's Body Autopsied</h3>
<p>Cause of death unrelated to the assassination</p>
<p>Brain and internal organs preserved in the Imperial University Hospital</p>
<p>Electric Communication Agency, Tokyo, 27th: Hamaguchi's corpse, according to his will, was transported to the autopsy room of the Imperial University at midnight this morning. Dr. Ogata performed the autopsy, assisted by his eldest son, Takehiko Miki, and three attending physicians. In addition, Hamaguchi was posthumously promoted to the second rank of Shō-nii for his merits.</p>
<p>Electric Communication Agency, Tokyo, 27th: Hamaguchi rose from his bed and enjoyed looking at the flowers on the morning of the day before his death, chatting with his family. He suddenly coughed at 11:30, and then vomited, his illness suddenly endangering him. Dr. Shioda and Dr. Komagafuchi heard the news and rushed to the scene, but found that he was already hopeless, but his consciousness was still clear. He knew that his death was approaching and called his family to his bedside, saying, "I am saying goodbye forever. It is fate." At this time, his old classmate and friend Izawa Takio also rushed to the scene upon hearing the news, took his hand and called, "Hamaguchi, Izawa is here, do you know?" He was still able to nod his head in understanding, and then passed away. Today was exactly the 286th day since the assassination.</p>
<p>Electric Communication Agency, Tokyo, 27th: Prime Minister Wakatsuki visited Hamaguchi and told people that he had a deep relationship with Hamaguchi, was a colleague for many years, and was a person who devoted himself to the country and shared political joys and sorrows. At his death, he was filled with all kinds of feelings. Since the disaster, he had hoped that he would rise again, but now he has passed away, which is very sad.</p>
<p>Electric Communication Agency, Tokyo, 27th: Hamaguchi's remains were autopsied at the Imperial University Hospital at midnight this morning by Dr. Ogata. According to his announcement, a bullet was embedded in the ischium of the hip joint. From the outside, it was 1.2 centimeters long and not rusted. The bullet wound had completely healed. The cause of death was actinomycosis, which was not related to the external injury. The weight of the brain was 1495 grams, which was 145 grams heavier than the average person. The sulci were also complex, making it a good brain. After the autopsy, the brain and the internal organs with bullets embedded in them were preserved at the Imperial University, and the corpse was transported back to his private residence in Seishiyama at 3:30 AM. The coffin was placed at 1:30 PM. The remains will be kept for three days. After the funeral, he will be buried next to the late Count Kato Takaaki in the Aoyama Cemetery. The Emperor dispatched Noguchi Tsutae to the funeral at 3 PM today.</p>
<p>Electric Communication Agency, Tokyo, 27th: After the death of Hamaguchi, the president of the Minseitō, the Seiyūkai observed the following changes in the Minseitō: Hamaguchi had already resigned as president, so his death has no direct impact on the party. However, the Hamaguchi faction, including Eki and Miki, had been using former President Hamaguchi as an idol and occupied a position of power in the party. Since Hamaguchi has passed away, the power relations within the party will inevitably change. For example, the Miki faction has always valued itself because of Hamaguchi, and will no longer be considerate and will be active. If the issue of consolidation of provinces arises, internal party disputes will become more obvious, or it may lead to the collapse of the cabinet, which is unpredictable. This situation will also affect the elections for prefectural assemblies this autumn, and local officials will not be able to command as they wish.</p>
<p>Anglo-American Loan Negotiations</p>
<h3>Proceeding Smoothly</h3>
<p>Reuters, New York, 26th: According to the general opinion of the financial community, the British loan will soon be established. According to informed sources, formal negotiations have not yet begun, but this statement cannot be taken as a solution to the loan problem, which has not yet been considered. It is expected that informal talks will begin soon. Kirkland, a shareholder of the Morgan Company, went to Europe last night, which has special significance, as the Morgan Company is the financial manager of the British government in the United States.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 27th: Talks about a powerful American banking group providing a huge loan to Britain are currently proceeding smoothly. The banking group is currently being organized. The negotiations are being conducted via telegram and telephone with Norman, the Governor of the Bank of England, who is currently in Canada, and financial figures in London. It is said that an agreement can be reached before the Parliament convenes on September 8.</p>
<p>Arctic Exploration</p>
<h3>Will Have Significant Development</h3>
<p>Speech by Professor Samoilevich</p>
<p>National News Agency, Moscow, 26th: Today, University Professor Samoilevich gave a speech at the Academy of Sciences on the Arctic exploration with the Zeppelin airship, saying that the scientific achievements obtained during this trip are of utmost importance and have opened up new avenues for entering the Arctic region. It is expected that the northern exploration activities next year will be much more active than before. There are two important experiments, one of which is an automatic exploration vessel. The vessel is very small, equipped with self-recording instruments, and will be launched from Novaya Zemlya or North America into the Arctic region. The vessel is ingeniously constructed, able to rotate among the ice floes without changing its direction. When it is blocked by ice rocks and cannot move forward, it can automatically transmit its approximate location. The vessel is already under construction. Other details cannot be disclosed at this time. The other is a newly built icebreaker, which will take the northern route from Arkhangelsk to Vladivostok.

<p>German Chancellor Talks</p>
<h3>World Economic Crisis</h3>
<p>Relief measures…</p>
<p>There should be the closest international cooperation</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 26th: German Chancellor Brüning told the Associated Press correspondent today that this winter will be the most difficult period in nearly a hundred years. Germany is like this, and the rest of the world is no different. The world economic crisis will continue and become more serious. The only relief measure now is the closest international cooperation. He expects that the reparations issue may not make much progress before the US Congress approves the Hoover Plan this winter. Before formally considering the German-French ten-year political truce proposal, Germany is willing to first reach an agreement with France, Germany, and other countries on economic issues, especially on tariff issues. He also said that the German government does not necessarily have to follow the plan to build six new pocket battleships before 1938.</p>

<p>Hunan Border</p>
<h3>Withdrawal of Guangdong-Guangxi Troops</h3>
<p>All Counties in Southern Hunan Report to the Province</p>
<p>A dispatch from Changsha reports that there have been rumors recently that the Guangdong and Guangxi armies are invading Hunan. Until last week, a part of the Guangxi army under Tan Lianfang retreated from the Huangsha River area to Quanzhou. The Guangdong army in Jiufeng Pingshi also withdrew. The Hunan border area has become peaceful. All counties in southern Hunan have sent telegrams reporting: (1) A telegram from Lingling states that according to merchants returning to Hunan from Guangxi, the reason why the Guangxi rebels sent troops across the Hunan border this month was because they heard that the Central Army was preparing to launch a southern expedition, and they had to prepare in advance. Recently, because our army has no troops coming to Yongzhou, the troops crossing the river have retreated to the west bank of the Huangsha River. They have been sending scouts to Guilin and Quanzhou to investigate. The comprehensive situation is as follows: 1. There are about two regiments of rebels in Quanzhou, all of whom are new soldiers. Seventy percent have guns, and the rest are empty-handed. 2. Guilin is currently the concentration point for the rebel armies, and they are rushing to build defenses. It is said that Li (Zongren) and Bai (Chongxi) have also recently arrived there. Because the Shi rebels have been eliminated, the rebels dare not lightly invade. I know the matter is urgent, and I hereby report it. Respectfully, Hu Tianxiang, Magistrate of Lingling County. (2) A telegram from Dong'an states: 1. The Seventh Regiment, Third Battalion, and One Company of the Twenty-fourth Division (Tan Lianfang) formerly stationed in Huangsha River retreated to Quanzhou on the first day of the lunar month. 2. The only military force stationed in Quanzhou is the Quanxing Militia, with mixed guns, mostly made in Han, two machine guns, and a severe shortage of bullets, and two hundred coolies. 3. Quanzhou has been recruiting new soldiers to go to Guilin for several days. 4. Chen En Yuan, the police chief of Quanxingguan, was transferred to Guilin and reorganized into the Fourth Army. 5. Zhang Fakui is still in Hong Kong and has not returned to Guangxi. Respectfully, Li Yaonan, Magistrate of Dong'an County. (3) A telegram from Rucheng states that the Hu Militia Regiment (Hunan) has not returned to defense. The Guangdong army stationed in Jiufeng has withdrawn to Kaitang Village. Only one battalion is stationed in Pingshi, and it also appears to be withdrawing. About two regiments have arrived in Lechang. Remnants of the Guangdong bandits Deng (Shixi) and Yu (Jingbang) have been discovered in Miaotou Xu. Troops have been dispatched to suppress them. Respectfully, Wan Fangzhou, Magistrate of Rucheng County. Secretary Lu Zhengyuan and Deputy Director of the Neighborhood Militia, Hu Fengzhang. (4) A telegram from Qiyang states: 1. According to intelligence reports, about two battalions of rebel troops are stationed in Huangsha River, preparing to return to Quanzhou. The atmosphere of invading Hunan has completely dissipated, and the Yongzhou territory is peaceful. 2. Rumors in subordinate counties have also subsided. Further investigation reports will follow. Respectfully, Yang Yanxuan, Magistrate of Qiyang County. (5) A telegram from Officer Bai states: 1. Guangxi rebel troops in Quanzhou have been withdrawing to Guilin for the past two days. Heavy troops are also stationed in Xing'an, and the situation is serious. 2. It is rumored that Zhang (Fakui)'s troops stationed in Yongwu, because Zhang Fakui himself is in Hong Kong and has not returned, and there is no military pay, the soldiers do not obey orders, and two regiments have rebelled. Li (Zongren) and Bai (Chongxi) and other rebels have transferred troops to prevent disturbances, and the situation is very chaotic. 3. There are no rebel troops in the Huangsha River area. Currently, only the militia is left to defend it. Only one regiment of Tan Lianfang's troops is stationed in Quanzhou. 4. The Guangdong Road Government is controlled by Chen Jitang, the Party power is controlled by Wang (Jingwei), and the military power is controlled by Xiang (Hanping) and Gu (Yingfen). Each has his own plans, and disputes arise from time to time. Financial difficulties and military pay have not been released for several months, and opinions are becoming increasingly chaotic. There is no possibility of invading Hunan. The security of all counties on the Hunan border has returned to normal.</p>
<p>Wang Rongbao Investigates</p>
<h3>Report on the Wanxian Incident</h3>
<p>After the Wanxian Incident occurred, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs immediately telegraphed Wang Rongbao, the Minister to Japan, to go to investigate. Recently, after Wang returned to China, he reported the facts to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>Confidential report. On July 9th of this year, I received your telegram regarding the Korean incident. The government attaches great importance to it. Please go to investigate and express condolences. After the matter is completed, please come to Beijing, etc. I immediately telegraphed to request a staff member to accompany me and asked Councilor Jiang to temporarily act as the head of the consulate. I also stated that after the matter in Korea is completed, I will go to Liaoning and Yan to investigate and discuss everything, and then return to Beijing immediately. I received a reply telegram approving it. I then scheduled a meeting with Foreign Minister Shidehara and notified him in person. I departed from Tokyo on the 13th of the same month, passing through Kobe. I immediately transferred Consul Ren Jiafeng from the consulate to accompany me and assist in all matters. I went to all the places in Korea where the incidents occurred, including Busan, Seoul, Pyongyang, Zhennampo, Incheon, and Sinuiju. I have telegraphed the general situation in advance. I left Korea on the 23rd, stayed in Andong for one day, and stayed in Shenyang for two days. I met with important local officials and clarified the whole story of the so-called Wanbaoshan Incident. I then took the Beining Line directly to Pingjin, paid my respects to Deputy Commander Zhang, and immediately purchased a boat ticket because I learned that the Jinpu Southern Section was blocked by water. I changed to the sea route and went south, arriving in Shanghai on the 5th of this month and arriving in Beijing today. After investigating the situation in various disaster areas, Pyongyang was the most severely affected, followed by Incheon. The situation in the other areas was relatively early and did not lead to major changes. I will now report the situation in each place separately as follows:</p>
<p>Pyongyang, Zhennampo, On the evening of July 4th, Zhennampo Consul Xu Sui learned that anti-Chinese riots had occurred in Seoul and Incheon. On the morning of the 5th, he formally sent a special telegram to the police chiefs of the South Pyongan and Hwanghae Provincial Governments, the police chief of the Pyongyang Police Station, and personally met with the police chief of the Zhennampo Police Station, entrusting them to protect the overseas Chinese properly. He also discussed preventive measures with the local chamber of commerce. As for the Pyongyang incident, representatives from all walks of life of the local overseas Chinese claimed that at about 11:00 AM on the 5th, they received a phone call from the Pyongyang Police Station, asking the chairman of the chamber of commerce to go to the station for a discussion. At that time, because the chairman had just returned to Andong, the executive committee member Zhang Jingxian and translator Luo went together. They were received by Senior Director Ando, who said that if riots occurred locally, the station would definitely provide effective protection. If Koreans caused trouble, he hoped that they would be particularly tolerant and close their doors early, and they could rest assured. After returning to the chamber of commerce, he immediately notified all overseas Chinese to be cautious and take precautions. By about 7:00 PM, a sudden riot broke out. Countless rioters gathered, holding clubs, knives, axes, stones, and other weapons, and carrying flashlights. They attacked the houses of overseas Chinese, regardless of farmers, industrialists, merchants, and wealthy people, in teams and shifts. They beat our Chinese, regardless of men, women, old, and young, to death. They destroyed and looted property, burned accounts, and carried flammable materials, trying to set fires everywhere. The commanders used police whistles, and the organization was quite complete. It did not stop until dawn. The cruelty was rare in the world. The police at various places did not wear weapons and tried to stop them with their bare hands. What good did that do? By the 9th, it was known that more than a hundred people had been killed, and more than two hundred people had been injured. After investigating the entire Korean anti-Chinese incident, Pyongyang was the most severe. Local government officials did not take serious precautions after receiving telegrams from the consulate. The provincial government had no precautions. The police station made empty promises. After the riots broke out everywhere, they still did not take decisive measures. That night, the police were not armed, and the army did not move out, so the rioters had no fear and were able to carry out their crimes. Their negligence, dereliction of duty, and disregard for the lives and property of our overseas Chinese were such. The Pyongyang overseas Chinese affairs were under the jurisdiction of the Zhennampo Branch. When the branch learned of the matter on the morning of the 6th, there were also unstable rumors in Zhennampo. In addition to discussing emergency measures with the local chamber of commerce and Japanese government officials, Consul Xu Sui took a car directly to Pyongyang. When he arrived at the station, the stationmaster and personnel from the provincial government were waiting to receive him. They said that our overseas Chinese had been properly accommodated, and armed police, troops, and fire brigades had been dispatched. There was nothing to worry about after that. If there was anything to instruct the overseas Chinese and government officials, they would relay the message. It was useless to see them now, and the situation in Zhennampo was very urgent, so please return quickly to take charge. Consul Xu Sui reluctantly agreed to their request and immediately took a car back to Zhennampo. As expected, at about 2:00 PM, Koreans gathered everywhere, and armed police disbanded at any time. Overseas Chinese flocked to the consulate to take refuge. Overseas Chinese in remote farms and shops also negotiated with the police station to send police to search for and escort them. However, those who were a little late had already been beaten. By about 6:00 PM, all were accommodated. At about 7:00 PM, the rioters gathered more and more, and although the police tried to suppress them, they were too few and could not take care of everything. The farms and some shops of our overseas Chinese were still stoned, smashed, looted, and set on fire. On the following 7th, there was even talk of attacking the consulate, because some rioters from Pyongyang came to Pu to help, and the situation became even more dangerous. Fortunately, a telephone was temporarily installed on the evening of the 6th to negotiate directly with the provincial government and send more troops and police, so assistance was provided one after another, and the public was safe. Although property losses were unavoidable, there was no tragedy because of the early accommodation. On the 8th, Consul Xu Sui went to Pyongyang to inspect and express condolences. He also appointed a temporary investigator to investigate the damages in Pyongyang, Zhennampo, and other places together with the investigators from the chamber of commerce. According to the investigation, excluding those who were unable to investigate after returning to China, those who did not report indirect losses, and those who have not yet been recorded, the total losses in Pyongyang are about 2,545,000 yen, and the losses in Zhennampo and other places are about 117,000 yen. As for the number of deaths and injuries in Pyongyang, according to the provincial government, 95 people died. According to our investigation, 109 people died, 163 were injured, and 63 were missing. 19 people were injured in Zhennampo. Rongbao arrived in Seoul on July 16th. Because Pyongyang was the most severely affected, I went to Pyongyang that night and arrived on the morning of the 17th. I went to various places to inspect and express condolences. I first went to the medical training center to express condolences to the overseas Chinese who were taking refuge. The center accommodated up to 5,000 people at its peak. Except for those who continued to return to China, there were still more than 1,000 people being accommodated as of the 17th. The shelter had facilities such as toilets, bathrooms, infirmaries, thatched sheds, and kitchens. I discussed with Meng Xianxi, the president of the chamber of commerce, to have representatives elected by various groups to go to the hotel in the afternoon to talk to Rongbao. Later, I went to the Provincial Hospital to visit the injured overseas Chinese. There were still about 100 people in the hospital for treatment. Most of them would recover soon and could be discharged from the hospital immediately. In addition, it would take a week or ten days to recover. The general patients were very happy to see Rongbao visit the hospital, and they all said that they were no longer in pain and would recover soon. However, a Mr. Wang was weeping because his wife and children had been killed. He was extremely pitiful. Later, I went to Changshan Cemetery to pay tribute to the dead and injured civilians. The cemetery was divided into five rows. According to the provincial government, 20 people were buried in each row, one coffin and one grave per person. However, there were two infants who were buried together in one coffin. The first row was shorter, and it was said that there were a total of 95 people. Later, I went to inspect the destroyed shops. At 4:00 PM, I met with Meng Xianxi, Wang Zichen, Zhang Jingxian, Xu Weimin, representatives of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, Wang Zeguo, a representative of the Chinese Restaurant Association, and Liu Wenzhi, a representative of the Chinese Farmers' Association. They said that dozens of injured civilians, women, and children were willing to return to China, and they requested that a way be found to do so. I negotiated with the government officials to prepare a car to send them back to Andong. The overseas Chinese in the shelter were also preparing to leave. Four larger overseas Chinese shops were selected to accommodate them separately. Some overseas Chinese who still lived in the vegetable gardens were returning to farming, and others were returning to their home countries. The Japanese side still agreed to provide food to the unemployed for about ten days. If they were still unable to make a living at that time, the various overseas Chinese chambers of commerce would temporarily provide relief. Rongbao also launched an emergency relief effort for the distressed overseas Chinese in Korea while in the East. More than 10,000 yuan in national currency has been donated by Osaka, Kobe, and other places, and fundraising is still continuing in various places. It will be remitted to Korea one after another. At the same time, Japanese and Korean groups have also sent慰問現金慰問物品 as gifts. Because they were for relief purposes, they were all received and distributed. Later, Zhennampo Consul Xu Sui reported to the Japanese police chief that after investigating Pyongyang overseas Chinese, 108 people died, 3 in Hanchuan, and 1 in Shenghuli. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Yan Xishan Chanting Sutras and Reciting Buddhist Scriptures</h3>
<p>Ge Liu Bao All Visit Yan in Wutai</p>
<p>A dispatch from Taiyuan states that Ge Jingen and Liu Guang came to Taiyuan a few days ago to discuss important political affairs in Shanxi Province with Xu Yongchang. On the 20th, Ge Liu and Xu Yongchang's secretary Wang Ping and others took two cars and departed from Taiyuan at about 6:00 PM to visit Yan Xishan in Wutai. When they arrived near Liulin Village in Cao County, the car Ge was riding in suddenly crashed into a tree, causing Ge to suffer a minor arm injury and the engine to be destroyed. Ge Liu and others then shared a car and arrived at Xihui Village in Wutai at about 10:00 PM. Feng Yuxiang lived in this village last year, and Yan is also living here now. Yan's father still lives in his original residence in Hebian Village.</p>
<p>The courtyard where Yan lives is extremely simple, with only a few police and soldiers guarding the perimeter. After Ge Liu and others got out of the car, Yan personally greeted them outside the door and led them to the inner room for a conversation. Yan's attitude was extremely calm. According to what he told Ge Liu, his return to his hometown was purely to visit his relatives and had no political intentions whatsoever. He would not make any comments on the current situation. Apart from living with his family and occasionally visiting the countryside, he did not want to ask about anything else. He declined all visits from friends from all sides, except for those who came for private talks, to avoid suspicion. Ge Liu talked with Yan for about three or four hours before leaving and returning to Taiyuan. However, Ge Liu's meeting with Yan was purely a private matter, and they offered some advice, hoping that Yan would leave Shanxi as soon as possible to quell the rumors. Yan expressed his agreement with the words of the two men.</p>
<p>According to those around Yan, Yan goes to a temple near Xihui Village every day to chant sutras once, to purify his mind and rest. His attitude is extremely silent. Judging by his appearance, he seems to want to sever ties with the world and transcend to a celestial realm. Bao Wenxue, who came with Ge Jingen, also went to Xihui on the morning of the 21st together with Artillery Supervisor Zhou Dai to visit Yan. They are scheduled to return to Taiyuan last night and take the express train to Pingjin with Ge Liu and Xu Yongchang this afternoon. Also, Wang Jingguo and Li Shengda are planning to go to Pingjin with Ge and others to visit Zhang Xueliang, because they failed to meet him on their previous trip to Pingjin as Zhang Xueliang was sick.

<h3>Chen Cheng Uses Military Fire to Attack the Red Bandits</h3>
<p>More Than 2,000 Remnant Guns Recovered</p>
<p>More Than 5,000 Bandits Burned to Death</p>
<p>More Than 5,000 Also Surrendered After Coming Down the Mountain</p>
<p>A dispatch from Nanchang states that the Red Bandits, who gather and disperse unpredictably and whose whereabouts are erratic, often hide in deep mountains and remote valleys, making it impossible to find out their exact location. When the troops of Chen Cheng and Luo Zhuoying recently advanced to suppress the area under Ningdu Xingguo, the bandits hid deep in the local mountains, and the officers and soldiers could do nothing about it. On the 18th and 19th of this month, the southeast wind was strong. Commander Chen then used the strategy of burning the Red Cliffs to order his subordinates to prepare flammables, and at the same time, ambushed heavy troops at the key passes of various mountain passes. At 1:00 PM on the 18th, all the officers and soldiers set fire to the mountains at the same time. At that time, the wind was very strong, and in a short while, the fire had spread all over the mountains and reached the top of the mountains. Many of the bandits' guns, ammunition, and gunpowder exploded due to the fire, and the sound shook the mountains and valleys. Countless bandits were burned to death, and those who dared to rush out through the fire were all annihilated by the ambushing troops guarding the mountain passes. By the 19th, the fire had finally been extinguished. The various units went up the mountain to search and recovered more than 2,000 remnant guns. They found the charred corpses of bandits, about 5,000 or more, scattered all over the ground, and the stench was unbearable. After the Red Bandits in the mountain were eliminated, it was heard that the Red Bandits in other mountains, because the source of food and supplies had been cut off, such as salt and rice, etc., could not be found, and many of them disguised themselves as farmers and came down the mountain to surrender. The Headquarters issued a message that, according to the telegrams from various generals, the number of bandits surrendering in the past five days has been increasing day by day. It is estimated that Sun Lianzhong's troops have taken in more than 800 people in the Gulonggang area, Chen Cheng's and Cai Tingkai's troops have each taken in more than 600 people, Zhao Guantao's and Wei Lihuang's troops have each taken in more than 300 people, Gong Bingfan's troops have taken in more than 900 people, Ma Kun has taken in more than 200 people in Ganzhou, Mao Bingwen has taken in more than 100 people, Shangguan Yunxiang has taken in more than 500 people, and Jiang Dingwen has taken in more than 100 people, totaling more than 5,000 people. Commander-in-Chief Jiang telegraphed the above units, approving them to be temporarily detained, but it is necessary to pay attention to whether they are feigning surrender, and to supervise and persuade them at any time. As for the pseudo-third and fourth armies belonging to Zhu Mao, they have recently fled back from Ningdu Guangchang to Ruijin and are looting money and rice in the western countryside of Ruijin before fleeing into the mountains. Also, because there were too many casualties in the battles of Huangpi Xiaopu Longgang Liantang, etc., it was impossible to replenish them. Whenever a man was encountered, he was captured to fill the bandit army, and women were divided into washing and comforting teams according to their age. Therefore, most of the local people, except for those who have already fled, have been forcibly incorporated into the Red Bandits. The fields are barren, the houses are in ruins, and the scene is extremely tragic. (August 21)</p>
<h3>Shandong Province Sends Telegram to Beijing Requesting Relief for Disaster Areas</h3>
<p>Twenty-One Counties Report Disasters</p>
<p>A dispatch from Jinan states that the water disasters in Shandong Province have been reported by various counties. The Department of Construction received another telegram yesterday from Song Longming, the district chief of the fifth district of Yi County, stating that the area under his jurisdiction is located in the lower reaches of the Grand Canal in Yi County, and the terrain is the lowest. Since late July, there has been continuous rain, and there have been two floods. The Gushao Xinhe, Jinhefang, Xiawang, Shangwang, and other communities in this district have been submerged in beans and rice by one-third. Unexpectedly, on the 2nd of this month, there was thunder, lightning, and torrential rain that lasted for five days and nights. Mountain floods broke out, and the river rose and the dikes collapsed. The streets of Taizhuang were several feet deep in water. The communities on the banks of the river were all turned into swamps. Su Huanzhang, the chief of the Taizhuang Public Security Bureau, Yuan Guangchang, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, and several community leaders took a boat to survey the area. Most of the more than 230 villages under the jurisdiction of this district were submerged in water. Houses collapsed, beans and rice were washed away, people and livestock were drowned, and corpses floated with the water. The residents, old and young, in Taizhuang were standing in the water, and the sight of their wailing was unbearable to witness. This flood is unprecedented in the past thirty years. Please find a way to provide relief to help the disaster victims and save the lives of the people. After receiving the report, the Department of Construction immediately telegraphed the National Government Relief Administration and the Provincial Relief Administration, requesting that relief be provided.</p>
<p>The tail dike of the lower reaches of the Yellow River in Lijin County was breached due to the sudden rise of the river a few days ago. Yue Guangnai, a representative of the disaster area, presented a request to the Department of Civil Affairs and Finance and the River Affairs Bureau for relief. However, since then, although the water level in various streams has dropped, the water level at the breach of the newly built tail dike is still rising sharply. The fields and crops have been flooded, and countless people and livestock have died. The fields and villages in the Northeast Dongxin area have been completely submerged, and the disaster is extremely severe and unprecedented. Yue Guangnai, the disaster area representative of the county, telegraphed the provincial government and the Department of Civil Affairs and Finance and the River Affairs Bureau again on the 24th, requesting immediate relief to save the disaster victims. At the same time, he also telegraphed various agencies, groups, and charities, calling for relief.</p>
<p>The Shandong Provincial Relief Association had previously telegraphed the Central Relief Committee to request relief for the water disasters in Jinxiang and other thirteen counties. Yesterday, because nine counties including Teng Yi had successively reported water disasters, they telegraphed the Central Relief Committee again to request relief. The telegram said: Nanjing Relief Committee, please note. The water disasters in Shandong Province, including Jinxiang and other thirteen counties, have been stated in the telegram on the [omitted] day. Since then, there has been intermittent rain, and the river has overflowed. As of today, nine more counties, including Teng County, Yi County, Ziyang, Dongping, Zhangqiu, Cao County, Yucheng, Wenshang, and Jining, have reported water disasters. Either because of accumulated water causing trouble, or because of mountain floods breaking out, people and livestock have drowned, and houses have collapsed. The remaining old and young are sheltering on high ground, enduring hunger and waiting for assistance. Moreover, the water level of the Yellow River has not stopped rising, which is worrying everywhere. Thinking about the future, it is even more frightening. In addition to distributing the existing funds to provide relief to the most deserving, we hereby present the counties that have successively reported water disasters to you for your kind attention. We beg you to quickly allocate large sums of money to urgently save the remaining lives. We await your orders with utmost urgency. Shandong Provincial Relief Association respectfully.</p>

<h3>Sand Island Embankment Breached for Several Tens of Zhang</h3>
<p>Over 70,000 Mu of Farmland Flooded, Over 30,000 People Affected. From Beijing News: Sand Island Embankment, near the outskirts of Beijing, is the primary embankment of Jiangning County. Since the beginning of summer, there have been continuous torrential rains for many days, and both the river tide and river water have risen. Leng Jun, the County Magistrate of Jiangning County, in order to prevent the collapse of the embankment, organized a levee patrol team, appointing Deng Biaoyu, the Captain of the County Police Brigade, as the team leader, and supervised the embankment residents to rush to rescue. Therefore, although there were several dangers, they were fortunately avoided due to effective rescue efforts. However, on the 25th, a sudden hurricane occurred, and the river tide surged more than a foot. That night, the river waves vibrated violently, and the embankment was in extreme danger. Although the levee patrol team rescued all night, by twelve o'clock at night, a section of Mojiawan and a section of the three-hundred-zhang new embankment suddenly collapsed for several tens of zhang, and the rescue was ineffective, resulting in the breach. The County Magistrate of Jiangning County learned of this in the morning and immediately led the heads of the Public Security Bureau, Land Bureau, and Construction Bureau to rush to the site to investigate and plan rescue measures. Sand Island Embankment is the most important embankment in Jiangning County, and its relation is significant. After the breach, the entire embankment area was submerged. It is estimated that there are more than 70,000 mu of embankment farmland, and more than 30,000 people affected by the disaster, which is truly an unprecedented catastrophe. Relief efforts are currently underway.</p>
<h3>Fuzhou Business Tax Embezzlement Case</h3>
<p>Surveillance Placed on Zheng Jinqing and Four Others</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Since Fujian Province changed the various consumption taxes to business taxes, Zheng Jinqing has been in charge of the bamboo paper business tax. However, the original amount was 240,000 yuan per year, but Zheng only acknowledged 150,000 yuan. After the tax was levied, the actual receipts in June and July were 50,000 yuan, but Zheng only remitted 7,000 yuan. This was noticed by Su Wenbing, a staff member of the Business Tax Bureau, who reported it to He Gonggan, the Director of the Department of Finance. He immediately dispatched staff from the Department to the Zhuzhi Bamboo Paper Business Tax Collection Office on August 11 to search, and indeed found many pieces of evidence of embezzlement, and implicated Zhang Zhedan, the Acting Director of the Business Tax Bureau, and Sa Jiaheng, a staff member. The Department of Finance immediately dismissed Zheng Jinqing and appointed Lin Yi to take over, increasing the annual tax quota to 192,000 yuan. However, Xu Xida was willing to take over at 240,000 yuan per year, but was not approved, so he filed a complaint with the provincial government. Yang Shuzhuang, the Chairman, believed that the case was complex and should be thoroughly investigated, and public opinion was also extremely indignant. Therefore, at the meeting of the Provincial Government Committee on August 21, He Gonggan voluntarily submitted a report and requested a review. After deliberation, it was decided to send He Gonggan and Cheng Shiwei to investigate, and then determine a method after the report was submitted. After the meeting, the Provincial Government sent Secretary Wu Xianren, Chief Clerk Lan Dakeng, the Department of Finance sent Section Chief Wang Ziyi and Clerk Chen Yiwei, and the Department of Education sent Section Chief Zheng Qinde and Clerk Cai Shangmo, leading detectives from the Public Security Bureau, taking cars, to Zheng Jinqing, Zhang Zhedan, Sa Jiaheng, and the home of Lin Zhao, the director of the Zhuzhi Bamboo Paper Tax Collection Office, to search. The search started at 1:00 PM and ended at 5:00 PM, but no evidence was found. However, the Provincial Government is determined to thoroughly investigate this case, and strive to get to the bottom of it. Surveillance has already been placed on Zheng Jinqing and four others, and the Minhou Local Court also sent Prosecutor Yang Chongshi to the Business Tax Bureau on the 20th to review the case files and take notes of the answers and confessions of Zhang Zhedan and Zheng Jinqing, in preparation for prosecution. Currently, all parties are paying close attention to this case. More reports about changes will be provided (August 22).</p>
<h3>Guangdong Ferry Bombed Again by Bandits</h3>
<p>Incident Location: Guangzhou City</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The Guangdong Province ferry bombing case has occurred many times in the past month. Recently, another tragic bombing incident occurred in the provincial capital, a place heavily guarded by military police. It was found that the Guangdong Li ferry, which travels between the provincial capital and Chencun, usually anchors along the embankment. At the beginning of this month, it suddenly received a letter from the famous bandit gang Jian Kun, in the name of the Democratic Party, extorting a fee of 2,000 yuan at a time, and a daily bribe of 30 yuan, which must be sent on time, otherwise it would be treated with extreme measures. After receiving the letter, the ferry thought it was just a bandit's intimidation tactic, which was commonplace, and put the letter aside, only taking precautions from time to time. The bandit gang was greatly angered by this. At 7:25 AM on the 20th of this month, as the ferry was about to depart from the province, bandits disguised as passengers boarded the ship, and secretly placed a bomb hidden in a package at the ferry head, mixed in with the crowd and escaped. Later, merchant guilds sent goods, and the goods were stacked on the ship. A ship worker named Zhang Hong noticed a small iron box on the bow of the ship, containing iron hairpins and covered with a straw mat. He felt strange, stepped forward to lift it, thinking it was lost by a passenger, but thinking that it was obstructing traffic, he moved it. As soon as his hand touched the iron box, there was a loud noise, the explosives detonated, and black smoke filled the air. The ferry passengers were shocked and rushed forward to inspect. They saw Zhang Hong lying down injured, his hand blown away, his arm flesh torn off, and blood stains all around him. They knew he had been hit by the bomb and blown up. They immediately asked someone to carry the injured man to the nearby Second Hospital of Zhongda for treatment, cut off traffic, and searched for the bandits, but the bandits had already fled far away and could not be captured. The police officers found several business cards of the bandit gang (signed "Guangdong Provincial People's Party, Dwarf Kun of Panyu") and the iron shell of a bomb on the ship, and sent them to the Haizhu Police Branch for filing. It is reported that Zhang Hong, who was injured, was in serious condition after being admitted to the hospital, and his life may be in danger. When the authorities received the news, they immediately stepped up the arrest of bandits to protect navigation and merchants.</p>

<p>Corpses Discovered for Consecutive Days. Yesterday, amidst the howling of a hurricane, a floating corpse was found beached in the Caihua Jing River outside the west gate. The body was wearing a summer cloth long gown and appeared to be around thirty years old. The local town police reported to the county court prosecutor's office for inspection. The inspection confirmed that the person had died by drowning in the river. A corpse certificate was filled out, and a letter was found in the deceased's possession. The letter was signed Zhang Yuanchang, from Kunshan, stating that he was driven to this by poverty and illness. He hoped that a charitable organization would provide a coffin for burial. The judge instructed the town police to collect the body. Unexpectedly, today (the 27th), another monk's body was found in the Caibi Bridge River outside the west gate. It was later identified as Dahe, a monk from the Great Temple who had moved from the Xilin Temple. He had accumulated 100 yuan, which he lent to Lanfeng, the abbot of the Great Temple. Now, because the monk wanted to move back to the Xilin Temple, he was asking Lanfeng for the money. It is unknown why he suddenly died today. The case has been reported for inspection.</p>

<p>A Unique Divorce and Marriage Case A-Si, the son of Tang Heshang of Taiping Bridge in Sanguantang County, married a girl named A-Jian from the Gao family when he was young. After three years of marriage, they had no children. Recently, due to family matters, a dispute suddenly broke out, and the relationship between the couple deteriorated. Not only did Tang Zi insist on divorce, but the woman also wanted to separate. However, Tang's father felt that it was difficult because his daughter-in-law was diligent in housework and needed assistance in everything. He had a strange idea. The other day, he invited relatives and friends to discuss a solution. He married his son to a woman named Wu, and regarded his daughter-in-law as a goddaughter. He recruited her old relative Wu Hedi as a son-in-law by living in his family. Both parties agreed, and the marriage was completed the other day. This is a rare and interesting story in divorce cases.</p>

<p>Bizarre Murder Case and Corpse Transfer Dispute At Luosujing, a place bordering the seventh and eighth districts of the county, there was Jiang Songqin (Songting), who had some assets and was cunning and litigious. The tenant farmer Lu A-yin was often abused. The other day, he suddenly disappeared. In the evening, his body was found on Jiang's beach crossing. Jiang secretly kept the news and moved the body to Lijia Pavilion in the middle of the night, throwing it into the river. This was seen by someone cooling off. Jiang claimed that A-yin had a fever and was sent back, and drank water on the way, causing him to fall into the river and drown. Please find a way to rescue him. The villagers saw that A-yin's whole body was swollen, with blue marks all over, and realized that he had not died by falling into the river. They detained the boat and planned to report to the county government for inspection. Jiang took the opportunity to escape, asked someone to mediate, and ordered Jiang to pay 350 yuan to compensate the family of the deceased and settle the matter.</p>

<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Public Security Bureau Staff Accused of Accepting Bribes Xiao Gengsheng, who runs a cigarette shop in Junziju Alley outside the south gate of this county, was discovered by the Public Security Bureau. The other day, Inspector Huang was dispatched to crack down. Xiao and others were arrested. However, at that time, it was rumored outside the south gate that the Xiao family had 600 yuan in silver, which was also taken away. The next day, the incident was recorded in the Qinbao newspaper. After seeing the newspaper, Public Security Bureau Director Yin ordered Inspector Lv Baozhong to investigate and reply, but the reply was vague. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 26th, the Xiao family was arrested again by the Public Security Bureau. At that time, in addition to the cigarette owner Xiao Gengsheng, his old mother and cigarette guest Lu Yinbao and others were also arrested. They were immediately sent to the county. Shen, the judge, opened the court for trial. Xiao Gengsheng admitted that he smoked cigarettes and did not open a cigarette shop. Judge Shen sentenced him to a fine of 200 yuan and imprisonment for one year and one month. His mother was also sentenced to imprisonment for one year and one month and a fine of 80 yuan. Xiao's wife was also in the audience, and after hearing the verdict of her husband, she fell to the ground and fainted. Xiao Gengsheng himself cried and knelt on the ground, begging the judge to redress his grievances. Only then did he admit that he opened a cigarette shop, saying, "I pay more than 100 yuan in bribes every month, and I still have to suffer like this." After hearing this, the judge asked Xiao, "Who do you give your bribes to?" Xiao said, "Everyone in the Public Security Bureau, from the section chief to the patrol officers, receives them." Judge Shen asked if there was any evidence. He replied that there was a notebook to rely on, but he did not bring it and it was hidden at home. He immediately ordered two bailiffs, Zhang Danru and others, to accompany him to retrieve it and submit it to the court. The above-mentioned situation was indeed found. Xiao and others were detained for investigation. At that time, the Public Security Bureau was shocked when it heard the news. Director Yin and others went to see County Magistrate Tan and first detained the patrol officer Lu Zhenying who had handled the case, and the rest were thoroughly investigated.</p>
<h3>Jiading</h3>
<p>County Magistrate Thoroughly Investigates Extortion Case. County Magistrate Pan Zhongjia was secretly reported that police officers extorted more than 800 yuan from Bai Zhixiang, a villager in Luduqiao Township, and was furious. He is now strictly investigating the matter. The reason is that Bai Zhixiang lost clothes and other items worth 300 to 400 yuan a few days ago, and beat Jin A Xiao, who had stolen them nearby, to force a confession. Jin, unable to bear the pain, falsely accused Li Adong, who opened a pastry shop in Loutang, of stealing them. Bai gathered villagers and went to Lou to arrest Li privately and took him back to Lu, where they beat him severely. Li's family reported to the Third Branch of the Public Security Bureau, and the police were dispatched to the bureau to summon Bai, Li, Jin and others. After interrogation, they were sent to the County Public Security Bureau the next day, and Bai and Jiang, who helped commit the crime, were sentenced to adding violence to others and fined ten yuan each to close the case. However, before the Third Branch sent them to the county, it was rumored that police officers had extorted more than 800 yuan from Bai. The matter was over, and the details were secretly reported to the county government. County Magistrate Pan ordered Bai Zhixiang and the township police chief Zhu Xishan and detective team leader Yu Taiji to be brought to the case on the 23rd. He interrogated them secretly in the West Garden, and detained Zhu Xishan and Yu Taiji together to await investigation. On the 26th, he also detained Tian Zhihe, the director of the Third Branch, and secretly interrogated him in the West Garden, and ordered him to be detained immediately. Zhu Yaoxue was sent to temporarily replace the position of the director of the Third Branch. During the trial, the details were unknown due to the strict confidentiality, but it was heard that the case involved a lot of people. All walks of life are paying close attention to this case.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Zhu, Who Conspired to Harm Her Husband, Was Sent to the Court for Trial Zhou Jiashan, Director of the Eighth Branch of the Public Security Bureau, received a letter from Li Boru and others, the head of the Gengdu Township in the Third District, stating that the farmer Lu A-mei was old and weak, and his wife Zhu had an affair with Jiang A-xue, a farmhand from Changshu. A-mei slightly interfered, and A-xue and Zhu used beatings and threats. Recently, they have intensified their efforts. A-xue said to A-mei that he had to be strangled with a rope. The next day, A-mei found a hemp rope next to his wife's pillow, measuring one zhang and seven feet long. A-mei was so frightened that he ran out and has not returned for three days. After receiving the report, Director Zhou immediately ordered the police to summon Lu Zhu and Jiang A-xue to the case. After a preliminary trial, they were sent to the County Public Security Bureau and then to the County Court for trial in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>Appeal to Issue Silk Industry Public Bonds The Silk Factory Industry Union of this county found that the Silk Industry Relief Public Bond Regulations have been promulgated for more than a month, but have not been issued. Yesterday, they sent a telegram to Minister Kong of the Ministry of Industry and Minister Song of the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, asking them to have mercy on the suffering of unemployed workers and quickly change the procedures and issue them immediately to maintain the silk industry and comfort the public.</p>
<p>Reorganization of the Jiangsu Provincial Business Tax Bureau Since the beginning of this year, the Jiangsu Provincial Business Tax Bureau has established bureaus in various counties to handle various procedures such as investigation and registration, and the chambers of commerce have assisted in the business. Most of the industries have separately acknowledged the entire amount. The collection began on April 1. Now the first quarter's taxes have been successively paid separately. However, after several months, the collection has not been smooth. The taxes reported by the counties to the Department of Finance are only about 100,000 yuan, and the various expenses after the establishment of the bureaus have reached 70,000 to 80,000 yuan in the past six months. Moreover, merchants in various counties mostly insist that the starting date of the tax should be from June. In order to promote the new tax and achieve the greatest benefit, it is necessary to rectify it. After thorough consultation between Director Xu of the Department of Finance and Chairman Ye, it was decided to reorganize on September 1. Except for Zhenjiang, Suzhou, Wuxi and other 18 counties, which will set up separate bureaus, the business tax bureaus in the remaining counties will be attached to the finance bureaus, and the director of the bureau will be concurrently held by the director of the finance bureau. For small counties without a finance bureau, the county magistrate will concurrently hold the position in order to save expenses. Moreover, the Suzhou area is vast and the commercial markets are densely packed, ranking first among the counties in Jiangsu Province. At this time of active rectification, it is impossible to handle without smart and capable people. Yang Wubian, the director of the Wuxi Business Tax Bureau, is extremely capable, and after the tax was levied, he was able to maintain order, and his achievements were the best among the counties. It has now been decided to transfer him to Suzhou, and Wang Shutang, the former director of Suzhou, will be transferred to Wuxi. The appointment has been issued. Director Yang has rushed to handle the handover procedures and went to Zhenjiang to meet with Director Xu of the Department of Finance to ask for instructions on everything. The Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce believed that Director Yang was able to understand the difficulties of merchants in Wuxi and especially sent a telegram to Director Xu, requesting that he be exempted from the transfer in order to keep a skilled person.</p>
<p>Lin Huanbin, a Famous Bandit from Yixing, Surrenders Himself with Weapons Lin Huanbin, a famous bandit from Yixing, is from Kaosi Township, Huzhen. He has three brothers, all of whom are farmers. Last year, Huanbin went out to mill rice and joined the bandit party, lurking in the mountains. He went to Guangde the month before. Recently, the Yixing County Government has repeatedly received reports that Lin Huanbin participated in various robbery cases and ordered Lu Maohe, the head of the sixth district, to arrest Huanbin's brother Guangwen. Huanbin heard the news and thought that he was the only one who was a bandit and should not implicate his brothers. He immediately took a letter stating his willingness to reform, a wooden-cased gun, and twenty-five bullets and surrendered himself to the Water Police Inspection Office stationed in the town. The inspector Bai Guosheng immediately telegraphed the Ninth Team Headquarters and dispatched Sun Meizhang, the patrol officer of Patrol Boat No. 2, and Ye Songqi, the patrol officer of Patrol Boat No. 8, to inquire. When the boat arrived at the Danjia Alley in Huli Xu, Inspector Bai and the surrendered bandit Lin Huanbin were already waiting in the mulberry field. They were immediately taken aboard the patrol boat. Just as they were about to leave, Lu Maohe, the head of the Sixth District, rushed to the patrol boat and took Lin to the district office and convened the town's defense regiment. Together with the water police, they ordered Lin to lead them to the mountains to arrest the remaining bandits, but they had already fled and nothing was gained. Officer Sun and others then escorted Bandit Lin back to the team headquarters. After interrogation by Captain Huang Cheng, they sent the police to escort Bandit Lin to Xixi and return to the district headquarters for trial. It is reported that Lin Huanbin claimed to be the beloved disciple of Tang Jinbiao, a famous bandit leader. After Tang fled, Lin supervised his subordinates, who were extremely fierce. Now, due to internal disagreements and the vigorous pursuit by the government, he is willing to reform.</p>
<h3>Danyang</h3>
<p>Robbery and Injury in Maojiatang Chen Changjun and Chen Hesong, farmers in Maojiatang Village, Huangtang Town, Dongxiang, were living together. The other night, more than 20 bandits went to rob them and rushed in. The Chen brothers escaped from the side door. The bandits searched separately, but failed to satisfy their demands. They set fire and fired guns to show their power and escaped. After inspection, it was estimated that more than ten houses were burned down. Hesong's son, Rongkuan, was shot in a vital part. Changjun's four sons all died in the fire. The case has been reported for investigation.</p>

Wu Wenguang, the head of the township, has reported to District Chief Wang of the District Office, who is making every effort to exterminate them.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Reports of Disasters in Various Townships Amidst Strong Winds and Rain. Since the continuous rain in Zhenjiang last month, the river tide has been rising, and the Jinshan Road area near the river has become a swamp, and residents are complaining. Last night, the weather suddenly changed, with strong winds and heavy rain. The houses along the riverbank completely collapsed and were washed away. The areas along the river in the first district suffered the most, and telegrams reported the disasters. The details are as follows: (1) Jiuli Township: Due to strong winds and heavy rain last night at 2:00, the river tide rose above the riverbank, causing more than 2,000 mu of farmland from Ganlu Temple to Xiangshan to be flooded, and 40 to 50 houses were washed down. Debris floated in the water, and everything was washed away. The victims climbed trees and mountains and cried out in various ways. The water inside the levee was more than a zhang deep, and shallow areas were four or five feet deep. The river tide was overflowing, and there was no end in sight. The victims had nowhere to stay. (2) Baojin Township: The township, east from Ganlu Temple to the boundary of Dengxian, has a total of two to three hundred mu of fields, all completely submerged by water. The water depth is about five or six feet. Dozens of wood sheds and more than a hundred households were all submerged in water. (3) Dingye Township: The township is connected to Huangni Township. Due to the collapse of the riverbank in Huangni Township, the crops had been affected. The accumulated water has not yet receded, and they are still working hard to rush to rescue. Suddenly, heavy rain caused the river tide to overflow, completely submerging more than 700 mu of crops, and more than 120 households were submerged in the water. Livestock and debris were washed away. More than 700 victims were either avoiding on the roof or climbing tree branches, desperately calling for help, which is very pitiful. The Rescue Bureau has been requested to send red boats to provide relief. (4) Huangni Township: The township suffered the most damage last month. Yesterday at 4:00 in the morning, due to heavy rain and strong winds, the Longgeng levee collapsed another twenty zhang, and the waves were overwhelming, destroying more than 30 houses. More than a hundred residents on the shore were submerged in water and are in urgent need of relief. The above is the situation of the disaster in various townships along the river in the first district. The disaster in other districts and villages should also be similar to that in the first district. Although the crops in the mountainous areas had a relatively good harvest before, the strong winds last night may have made them sterile. The Zhenjiang County Party Department and the County Government believed that the disasters in various townships were severe and needed relief urgently. They convened various institutions and groups to organize a disaster relief committee to prepare to raise donations and distribute them. Now that the disaster in various townships has worsened, and the victims in various townships along the river are waiting for food, the relief cannot be delayed any longer. A meeting has been scheduled at 2:00 PM on the 29th in the Chamber of Commerce to jointly discuss the method of distributing emergency relief.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Disaster Situation in Various Places After Strong Winds and Heavy Rain. On the 25th, the east wind was tight, and sand flew with the stones. It rained suddenly after 5:00 PM. At night, the rain was heavy and the wind was strong. The walls collapsed and the houses collapsed. Three stockades in the back of the county government office, which were being repaired, collapsed at 4:00 AM on the 26th, injuring a craftsman named Chen Changshou who was staying overnight. The county magistrate gave him 50 yuan for compensation. The Guannanshou flagpole of the Deputy Transport Department was broken into three sections by the wind, knocking down a corner of the Nanpai stockade and a civilian house. As for the water situation in the Grand Canal, the rise and fall could not be explored due to the telephone and telegraph lines being blown off by the wind.</p>
<h3>Pinghu</h3>
<p>Eleven People Injured by Collapsing Houses The Yongxing Rice Mill in Zhoujiawei Town, Pinghu, was recently expanding its business and building a new factory building. It was completed the other day. Yesterday (the 25th) at about 1:00 AM, the building suddenly collapsed completely. Eleven people, including the Jiao family, were inside the house, all in a dream and unable to escape, and were all injured. They were later rescued and brought to the city for treatment. Hurricane and Rainstorm Caused Disaster. Since the morning of the 25th, the weather in Pinghu has suddenly changed, with strong winds roaring like tigers, and countless trees being blown down. Heavy rain poured down, and the river water suddenly rose by three feet. The water has submerged in low-lying areas. The wind and rain did not stop for a moment on the 25th. Several steamships in various ports have stopped sailing.</p>
<p>Former Director Accused of Illegal Actions Jiang Hongxun, the former director of the Pinghu Public Security Bureau, was impeached by the county party department for his private and corrupt practices while in office and for arbitrarily handling cigarette cases. Recently, merchants Li Xingyuan and others jointly accused Jiang of failing to fill in the amount on the receipts for fines and of embezzling 100 yuan for the Tangjiahama Shixing cigarette case and 30 yuan for the Yaofuk Daoshi cigarette case at the county government. It is understood that the county government has ordered Director Huang to investigate and reply. The bureau found that the Shixing case was 125 yuan and the Yaofu case was 25 yuan, and has reported the situation to the county government for legal action.</p>
<h3>Anqing</h3>
<p>Resolution of Property Dispute Involving Wuwei Taibei Zhou School: The property dispute involving the Wuwei Taibei Zhou School has been jointly submitted to the Provincial Government by the Civil Affairs, Construction, and Education Departments. It has been confirmed as school property, and the Provincial Government has resolved to approve it. The Education Department has instructed the county to handle it appropriately.</p>
<p>Proposed Financial Remedies: Anhui Province's financial income is insufficient to cover its expenditures. According to reports from the authorities, the deficit for the 20th year of the Republic has reached 1.5 million yuan. Combined with the arrears from the 19th year, the total deficit is 2 million yuan. Currently, the province is experiencing severe floods, exacerbating the deficit. The Finance Department is proposing two remedial measures: one is to levy an export tax on rice, and the other is to divert funds from road construction bonds. There are also plans to raise funds through surcharges on tobacco and alcohol, and to issue 3 million yuan in public bonds. These plans are being submitted to the Central Government for approval. It is also planned that after the 3 million yuan public bonds are issued, the funds from the road construction bonds will be returned.</p>
<p>Various Relief Efforts Amidst the Chaos: The flood situation in Anhui Province is extremely severe. The Relief Committee has agreed to allocate 170,000 yuan in relief funds and has dispatched the committee's secretary, Hong Jiong, to Anhui for inspection. Du Yuesheng of Shanghai generously donated 1,200 bags of flour, sending his representative, Jiang Zuozhou, to Anhui for distribution. Ma Jidi, an Anhui native in Beijing, donated 5,000 yuan to the Luning County Flood Relief Association for distribution. The Anqing Chinese Medicine Association has formed a flood relief clinic team, which opened on the 23rd near Guangjiwei. The Zhejiang Provincial Government has provided 3,000 yuan in aid to Anhui.</p>

<h3>Relief Bonds for Flood Victims</h3>
<p>Primarily to Issue 10 Million Yuan First</p>
<p>Entrust to Existing Fund Committee for Management</p>
<p>Minister Song made the following statement yesterday regarding the issuance of relief bonds for flood victims:</p>
<p>To provide relief for the current floods, the government originally planned to issue 10 million yuan in public bonds. This is a preliminary measure, as the exact amount of funds needed for relief will be determined after a detailed investigation and study by the Flood Relief Committee. The Legislative Yuan is currently advocating for the issuance of 80 million yuan in public bonds and proposes to use a portion of it to purchase relief grain. This seems to overlook the government's ongoing negotiations with the U.S. government to purchase American wheat. Regarding the establishment of a separate fund management committee, while the existing fund management committee has maintained the credit of public bonds with considerable success, it seems to have been disregarded. I am now proposing to the Central Government that, while the purchase of American wheat is under negotiation and the committee's proposal is being prepared, the original plan to issue 10 million yuan in public bonds should be implemented first, and the existing fund management committee should be entrusted with its management. It is well known that the current flood relief requires a large amount of funds. I fully support the government's efforts to raise funds for disaster relief to the best of its financial ability. However, we must be practical in addressing this issue. Therefore, as a first step in terms of finance, we should still approve the issuance of 10 million yuan in flood relief bonds according to the original proposal.</p>

<h3>Zhu Qinglan and Others Fly to Hankou</h3>

When I passed through Jinan a few days ago, I asked Zhou Baipeng to convey to He Chunlao to initiate disaster relief. I am now shocked to learn of Chunlao's passing yesterday. I am deeply saddened. I have always admired your enthusiasm for public welfare and your high reputation in Shandong. I respectfully request that you forward this to Chairman Han and unite with various legal entities to raise funds for relief, thereby expressing sympathy. Shandong is my second hometown. In the past, it suffered repeated disasters, and I was grateful for the generous assistance from various charitable organizations in the North and South. I cannot stand idly by during this flood in Jiangnan. On behalf of millions of flood victims, I bow nine times in advance. Shaojiang, my younger brother, please also convey my condolences. Sincerely, Zhu Qinglan."</p>

<h3>News from All Sectors on Disaster Relief Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Large Batch of Hankou Flood Victims Arriving in Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>The Flood Relief Committee, considering the severity of the flood in Wuhan, has specially requested the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to send the Jiangong vessel to Hankou to rescue flood victims.

<h3>Ningbo-Shaoxing Emergency Relief Association Establishes Accommodation Centers</h3>
<p>The Ningbo-Shaoxing Emergency Relief Association for the Hankou Disaster has dispatched the Xin Ningxing steamer, which was sent to Hankou to assist disaster-stricken fellow villagers. The ship departed from Hankou on the 20th with over 1,000 refugees and is expected to sail directly to Ningbo. However, due to insufficient coal, it may stop in Shanghai tomorrow to replenish coal. The association is deeply concerned that the increasing number of Hankou refugees arriving in Shanghai may disrupt order due to overcrowding. Therefore, it has borrowed the Ding Siming Guild Hall as the first accommodation center, the Yongxitang of the Zhejiang-Shaoxing Guild Hall as the second accommodation center, and the Zhejiang-Ningbo Guild Hall as the third accommodation center. Regarding the situation in Ningbo, County Magistrate Chen Guanling of Yin County is currently in Shanghai and has been contacted. When the Xin Ningxing arrives in Ningbo, additional military police will be dispatched to take care of the refugees and arrange for accommodation and transportation. It is also reported that the association received a telegram from Hankou urgently requesting a large quantity of biscuits for relief. It immediately purchased 60 large boxes, 30 of which were shipped on Saturday, and the remaining boxes are planned to be shipped to Hankou on Monday.</p>

Within three days, the association would be informed, and the funds would be handed over to well-organized relief organizations for rapid distribution.

More than ten people, including Liu Wanqing, attended the meeting. Ming Runshen was elected as the temporary chairman. First, Wang Xiaozhai and Liu Shanfu proposed that the disaster in Hubei Province was extremely severe and that relief was urgently needed. Although the committee members present had donated 10,000 yuan to the Hubei Fellow Villagers Association for remittance to Hankou on the 10th of this month, it was a drop in the bucket. Fearing that fundraising would be too slow to be effective, it was proposed that each committee member should contribute a certain amount in advance for remittance to Hankou for relief, which would be reimbursed from the relief funds raised in the future. The proposal was unanimously approved by the committee members, and a total of 10,000 yuan was raised, which would be remitted to Hankou immediately.</p>

Any disturbance would be met with severe punishment by the authorities. It was resolved to telegraph the provincial government and the disaster-stricken counties, convene various legal entities, and find ways to accommodate and appease the people. It was also requested that the provincial government issue public bonds, which would be repaid by surcharges on land taxes in each county in the future. (9) It was decided to hold a general executive committee meeting at 4:00 p.m. on August 29th at Yipinxiang to carry out fundraising.</p>
<h3>Emergency Relief for Calamities Organized by the Jisheng Society</h3>
<p>The China Jisheng Society, in light of the unprecedented calamities in various provinces, had no choice but to hold an emergency meeting to address the most pressing needs and rush to provide assistance. In addition to the appointment of Zhu Junqi, a standing committee member of the society, and Gu Yabin and other relief workers to go to Wuhan to investigate and carry out emergency relief, and the allocation of funds and flour from the fundraising association for flood relief in various provinces, the society has publicly invited Liu Junlingsheng and Qu Junzhancheng to investigate the severe flood situation in Anhui Province and select the most deserving cases for relief. The Jiangsu Province flood situation has also been entrusted to Zhou Junyuankai and Li Junyushu of the Qingjiang branch to investigate the severe disasters in the Huai'an, Huaiyin, Siyang, and other three counties, and the society has appointed Zhou and Li, the director and deputy director of the branch, to go to inspect the situation and select the most deserving cases for relief. The society's nine congee kitchens in Rehe Chaoyang in northern Hebei, which are jointly operated with the North China United Association, have achieved remarkable results and saved many lives and still need to continue their work. The society has allocated an additional 5,000 yuan to meet the urgent needs. However, the society's old relief efforts are not yet completed, and new relief efforts are coming one after another. The old debts have not been paid off, and new debts are huge. The calamity is so tragic that it cannot be ignored, but there is no money to provide relief. It is hoped that philanthropists and benefactors at home and abroad will be able to provide independent relief or join the society to work together to remedy the disaster in the slightest possible way.</p>
<h3>Enthusiastic Assistance from All Sectors</h3>
<p>Donations from Children and Newspaper Vendors: The Shanghai Fundraising Association for Flood Emergency Relief in Various Provinces received donations from Cui Lutong of Datong, Anhui Province, and Liu Yiming of Shanghai, which are truly commendable. One is a 12-year-old boy who donated 1,008 yuan, which he had accumulated over the years from gifts from his elders, through the Chengyuzhuang Bank in Wuhu for relief. The funds have been received by the Shen Bao and deposited with the Jin Cheng Bank. Cui Lutong is also skilled in calligraphy and has strong brushwork and is willing to write 50 pairs of couplets to be sent to Shanghai for sale to raise relief funds. The other is a poor newspaper vendor, Liu Yiming. According to his letter to the Emergency Relief Association, "I am a poor man selling newspapers at the Qinglian Pavilion, earning only four or five dimes a day. After expenses, I have only one or two hundred cash left. Sometimes, when business is bad, I have to borrow money at high interest to make ends meet. It is really hard. But compared to the fellow citizens who are suffering from the flood, I am much better off. Therefore, I am sending all the money I earned from selling newspapers for the past three days, including principal and interest, totaling one yuan and four dimes, and 26 copper coins. I have already sent the money to the Emergency Relief Association yesterday, saying, 'Poor people have no money, please accept it and save a life.' As he spoke, he sobbed and wiped away his tears."</p>
<p>Donations from the Faculty and Staff of the Wusong Merchant Marine School: The Wusong Merchant Marine School held a school affairs meeting on the 25th, as the autumn semester was about to begin.

<p>Chen Shaokuan</p>
<h3>Discusses Surveying and Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>First, Complete the Survey of the Jiangyin-Wusong Section</p>
<p>Flood Victims Flee Inland, Warships Unable to Provide Assistance</p>
<p>Chen Shaokuan, the naval commander and director of the Jiangnan Shipyard, came to Shanghai yesterday. A reporter from the Guowen News Agency met with Chen at the shipyard and asked him about the recent survey handover and the naval vessel disaster relief. The details of the conversation are recorded below.</p>
<p>Handing over the Surveying: Chen said that in the past, China did not pay much attention to maritime surveying and did not have a formal agency dedicated to surveying. Therefore, all matters were handled by the customs. Even today, to find a nautical chart, ships have to purchase them from foreigners. In recent years, the navy has realized that maritime surveying is crucial for national defense. Therefore, on the one hand, it has set up its own bureau and dispatched warships for surveying. At the same time, the customs marine office still dispatched its Zhuan Tiao and Liuxing surveying cruisers to survey outside the port. Now that the navy has a dedicated bureau, the customs surveying should be transferred for the sake of unifying authority. Moreover, the navy has almost completed surveying the coastline along the Yangtze River and the coast of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Fujian in the past two years. Only a few important port shores have not been surveyed. Therefore, the Ministry of the Navy has repeatedly negotiated with the customs to take over the surveying. Currently, the section from Jiangyin to Wusong is being transferred by Wu Guangzong, the director of the Shanghai Naval Surveying Bureau, together with Hanermen, a Westerner from the Customs Marine Office. The specific method of transfer will be completed in about two to three weeks. As for the Zhuan Tiao and Liuxing surveying cruisers under its jurisdiction, they will remain under the management of the customs for the time being due to the lighthouses and buoys outside the port.</p>
<p>Dispatching Warships for Disaster Relief: Hankou originally had the Chuqian and Rensheng cruisers docked there. Later, due to requests from charitable organizations to send warships to rescue the Hankou flood victims and protect the victims, the Xunning, Chuyou, Desheng, and Weisheng cruisers along the Yangtze River were temporarily transferred. However, most of the flood victims fled to higher ground inland, and the warships could not enter, so they have been unable to provide assistance. They are only providing protection. The rumors that the water level along the Yangtze River is rising and that bandits are emerging are not accurate. If they exist, they are only local bandits robbing and looting on the road. The navy currently has warships stationed along the Yangtze River as far west as Jianli and as far south as Changsha and Xiangtan. The navy suffered no losses during the recent typhoon disaster in the Jinghu area. Only the mud at the bottom of the second dock of the shipyard in Shanghai was loosened, and river water poured in. A few places where the transport factory was built along the river were blown down by the wind, but the losses were not significant.</p>
<p>Naval Maneuvers Not Cancelled: Chen Jiliang, the commander of the First Fleet, is leading the Hai Rong, Hai Chou, and other ten warships in naval maneuvers in Minjiang Sadu. The maneuvers must be completed by mid-September. Therefore, the previous report that the Hai Rong was dispatched to Cuba to participate in the opening ceremony of the Overseas Chinese Revolutionary Memorial Tower is unlikely to be realized.</p>
<p>Zhengji General Company Telephones to Confirm</p>
<h3>Guangli Ship is Safe</h3>
<p>After reports yesterday that the Zhengji Shipping Company's Guangli ship had struck a reef and sunk near Qingdao, causing passengers to drown, the Zhengji Shanghai office said yesterday that it had received a telegram from the Dalian General Company at 10:00 p.m. on the 26th, sent at 3:20 p.m. that day, stating, "Received your telegram. Guangli is safe in Andong." This indicates that the Guangli ship did not strike a reef. It is currently unknown which ship struck a reef near Qingdao, or it may be just a rumor.</p>
<p>Guangsheng Ship</p>
<h3>Rescued Sailors Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Relating the Tragic Fate of the Guang Sheng</p>
<p>The Guang Sheng, a ship belonging to Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., encountered a reef and sank in the waters off Wenzhou during the last typhoon. All of the over one hundred people on board perished. Only three sailors were rescued and returned alive. Two of these rescued sailors arrived in Shanghai yesterday. A reporter made a special visit to inquire, and the circumstances they described are as follows:</p>
<p>The True Picture of the Disaster: The Guang Sheng set sail from</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>Shanghai on the eighth of this month, heading for Shantou and Guangzhou. At 10 PM on the ninth, the ship reached Shandou Island, 180 miles from Fuzhou, and encountered a hurricane. The captain intended to seek shelter by the shore, but the wind was fierce and the waves extremely high. The engine failed, and the ship was spun around by the wind. After one night, at 7 AM on the tenth, the ship struck a hidden reef. The engine room was breached, the engine was destroyed, all the cabins took on water, and the electric lights went out. The ship then began to sink. At that time, the waves were over ten feet high. The Guang Sheng was ultimately sunk into the sea by the huge waves.</p>
<p>All Passengers and Crew Died: The Guang Sheng was fully loaded with cargo. There were about sixty passengers who had boarded in Shanghai, and about fifty crew members and sailors. After the accident, the radio was also ineffective. Everyone could only grab life jackets and allow themselves to sink into the sea. By about 8 AM, the entire ship had sunk into the sea. Not a single crew member or passenger survived; all drowned with the ship. There were also over a hundred horses and sheep on board, which also drowned. Among them, sailor Song Fusheng, stoker Su Guiyuan, and helmsman Li Peifang were swept away by the waves. After drifting for sixty hours, they were rescued by fishing boats on the night of the thirteenth.</p>
<p>Seeking Refuge in Dajin: These three sailors were rescued by fishing boats and taken aboard. They were half-dead. The fishing boats took the three men to Gaole Village and Dajin Village. Song and Su were taken in by the Tianxiang Store in Dajin. The next day, Li Peifang was also brought there. The three stayed in Dajin for seven days, inquiring about the Guang Sheng's entire crew and passengers. They learned that all had drowned. On the nineteenth, they boarded a wooden boat to Fuzhou. In addition to the stoker and sailors, there were twenty foreign employees on the Guang Sheng, none of whom survived. Yesterday, Song and Su arrived in Shanghai on the Wanxiang Wheel. Li Peifang remained in Fujian due to illness and has not yet arrived in Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Premier's Stamps to Be Used at a Later Date</h3>
<p>Post Office to start on the 10th of Next Month</p>
<p>The Directorate General of Posts had previously decided that, starting from September 1st, the new stamps with the portrait of the Premier (in denominations of 1 cent, 4 cents, 1 dime, and 2 dimes) would be used in all postal areas nationwide. The Directorate also ordered the Shanghai Postal Supply Office to allocate these new stamps, with the intention of gradually distributing them to all postal areas nationwide within the month, for uniform use at that time. According to a responsible person at the Directorate speaking to a Guowen News Agency reporter yesterday, the stamps may not be universally available nationwide by September 1st. The Directorate is considering postponing the implementation for three reasons: (1) The postal areas nationwide are vast, and the allocation of quantities is a complicated procedure. Although active efforts have been made to distribute them, the deadline is too close, and it is practically impossible to ensure that all twenty-three postal areas will have received and distributed the stamps by the end of the month. (2) The Director of the Department, Qian Chunqi, and the Director of the Beijing Printing Bureau, Shen Nengyi, have consulted in Beijing with the Postal Department of the Ministry of Communications regarding the printing of six types of martyrs' stamps by the Beijing Printing Bureau of the Ministry of Finance. It was agreed that 200 million martyrs' stamps would be printed within five years, with the printing price increased by 20% according to the usual price. The Beijing Printing Bureau will actively produce the stamps, and a batch of new martyrs' stamps will be published and used in about a month. The Directorate plans to use the Premier's and martyrs' stamps simultaneously. However, since the stamps currently being printed in Beijing still require time, only the Premier's new stamps can be sent out first. The martyrs' stamps will take another month and a half to be available nationwide. (3) The Directorate is postponing the use of the Premier's new stamps to the anniversary of the founding of the National Government on September 10th. The Directorate will submit this to the Ministry of Communications for approval in the coming days.</p>

<p>Xin Yi Li Ship</p>
<h3>Yesterday, Due to Rudder Damage and Rapid Tides, It Mistakenly Collided with a U.S. Warship</h3>
<p>Very Minor Damage, to Be Repaired by Yi Li</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the Xin Yi Li ship of the Yi Li Shipping Company in Shanghai was test-driving to Wusong yesterday when it collided with the U.S. gunboat USS Asheville, which was docked in the Huangpu River off the Bund on Rue Edward VII. The bow of the U.S. warship was damaged, while the ship was unharmed. The company consulted with the captain of the ship and the company directors on how to handle the situation. As a result, the company will be responsible for the repairs. It was decided to discuss the repair plan again today. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Brief History of Xin Yi Li: The Xin Yi Li ship of the Yi Li Company was purchased from the Austrian government in November of last year. It was originally an Austrian transport ship with a load capacity of 800 tons. After arriving in Shanghai, it was repaired by the Jiangnan Shipyard and converted into a merchant ship, to be used in the future to sail between Wenzhou, Shantou, and Xiamen. Previously, the ship's water rudder engine was slightly damaged and repaired by Xiechangxiang Machinery Factory. It has now been repaired and is docked at the Dada Wharf in Shiliupu. Reason for the Collision: Yesterday, the Xin Yi Li ship was test-driving to Wusong. At 8:30 AM, it lifted anchor from Dada Wharf. When sailing near the Bund on Rue Edward VII at 9:10 AM, the water rudder engine was damaged and could not turn. In addition, the tide was rapid, and there was no way to avoid it. It came into contact with the U.S. gunboat USS Asheville, which was docked there. The iron plate on the bow of the ship was slightly damaged. Fortunately, the Xin Yi Li ship was unharmed.</p>
<p>Resolution of the Aftermath: The captain and commander of the U.S. warship, Haley (transliteration), invited representatives of the Yi Li Shipping Company to discuss how to handle the situation. The owner of the company, Xu Tingzu, personally went to meet with the captain and commander. Because the personal relationship between the two sides has always been harmonious, and although the incident was accidental, the damage was very minor, so both sides were willing to resolve it peacefully. As a result, because the U.S. warship was docked in the Huangpu River, the Yi Li Company hired workers to repair it. It was decided that both sides would discuss the repair plan again today. The Xin Yi Li ship is still docked at the Dada Wharf, and will sail to Wenzhou after the water rudder engine is completely repaired.</p>

<h3>Killed Lover with Sharp Blade</h3>
<p>Xu Jinlian's Lack of Virtue</p>
<p>Chen Adong's Extreme Measures</p>
<p>Xu Jinlian, a woman from Jiangbei, residing at No. 114 Mingyuanfang, Huade Road, was stabbed to death with a sharp blade at around 9:45 PM last night. The Yangshupu police station dispatched detectives to investigate and apprehend the murderer, and Chen Adong was arrested on the spot, allegedly the culprit. The deceased was 20 years old and worked at the British American Tobacco factory on Huade Road. She met Chen two years ago, lived together, and started a relationship. The woman's occupation was introduced by Chen. Unexpectedly, the two could not treat each other with sincerity. Xu Jinlian had affairs with another man, secretly making things difficult and unsettling Chen. Therefore, the brutal killing of Xu may have stemmed from this. Xu Jinlian lived with her parents and younger sister. When the tragedy occurred last night, her father was also at home. He suddenly heard a scream coming from the woman's room, rushed to check, and saw Chen Adong fleeing. He immediately called the police to arrest him. Chen is 24 years old, also from Jiangbei, and previously worked in the tobacco silk section of the British American Tobacco factory. He will be sent to court today for questioning. When she died, the deceased was wearing a black shirt and white pants, with her hair styled like a fan. She suffered two knife wounds: one in the waist and thigh, and one in the right arm. An autopsy will be conducted today.</p>

<h3>Killed Wife with Three Knives</h3>
<p>Wife's Infidelity Leads to Husband's Deadly Act</p>
<p>Stabbed Eight Times, Blood Everywhere</p>
<p>The following are the details of a tragic case that occurred the day before yesterday at around 9:50 PM at Cunjia Crossing, Huxi, in which a husband and wife had a quarrel, and the husband hid three sharp knives and stabbed his wife eight times, endangering her life.</p>
<p>Family Situation: Dong Helang, 28 years old, a local, residing at No. 5 Cunjia Crossing, previously worked at the Edison Electric Light Bulb Factory. He was very sincere, diligent, and frugal, and worked hard to support his family. He married a woman surnamed Li, who is now only 23 years old, also a local. The wife has a beautiful appearance and a slender figure, and is also fond of romance. Since their marriage three years ago, they both worked at the same factory, and their income was barely enough to make ends meet. Therefore, their relationship was still harmonious. However, the wife was young and liked to be pretty, and seeing her husband's simplicity, she eventually became dissatisfied.</p>
<p>Cause of the Conflict: Since Dong was laid off from the factory last year, he stayed at home. Although his wife was still working at the factory, her monthly income was not enough to support the family. Because Dong had no income, he had to resort to pawn to make up for the deficit. As a result, the accumulated debt was quite large. The wife harbored resentment, and her wild ambition grew. Recently, she suddenly had an affair with someone, treating her husband like a stranger. Now, Dong learned that his wife was having an affair and tried to persuade her, but she did not listen and even insulted and scolded him. The other day, Dong had something to do outside and suddenly saw his wife walking away with a man, shoulder to shoulder. Dong was filled with resentment, both resenting his unemployment and the abandonment of his beloved wife. He immediately returned home with a heavy heart, hid three sharp knives, and conceived the idea of killing his wife.</p>
<p>Scene of the Tragedy: It was not until the bell rang nine times in the afternoon that the wife returned from outside. Dong initially said nothing. Moments later, the wife saw her husband's angry expression and prepared to go to bed. Dong suddenly opened his mouth and questioned his wife about what she had been doing outside. As a result, a war of words broke out, and a quarrel ensued. Dong suddenly jumped up, grabbed her, pulled out a knife, and stabbed her twice in the abdomen. The knife fell to the ground, and he pulled out two more knives from his waist and stabbed her six times in the legs. The wife fell to the ground in extreme pain, bleeding profusely. The landlord of the second room saw the tragic scene and, unable to bear it, immediately called the police, who arrested them both and took them back to the Sixth District Police Station.</p>
<p>Interrogation: After receiving the report, District Chief Ren immediately sent the wife to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment due to her severe injuries. According to the doctors, the injuries were very serious and her life was in danger. According to Dong Helang's statement, his wife, Li, had been having an affair with someone recently, and he had tried to persuade her, but she had insulted and scolded him, so he was filled with resentment and committed this heinous act. District Chief Ren, considering the case involved wielding a knife to injure someone, prepared a document yesterday to send the case to the local court for questioning.</p>
<p>Dafeng Silk Shop Accused</p>
<h3>Selling Counterfeit Fuchou Silk</h3>
<p>Counterfeiting the Single and Double Deer Brand Fuchou Silk</p>
<p>Also Using Other People's Names</p>
<p>Luo and Pang File a Lawsuit</p>
<p>Losses Sought are Divided into Two Parts</p>
<p>Shen Zicha, shareholder and manager of Dafeng Silk Shop on Hankou Road, and Jin Liquan, a shareholder of the shop, are being sued by Luo Kunxiang and Pang Zhuqing, the owners of Jiucheng Qiaji and Waicheng Zhiji silk shops, respectively, for counterfeiting their Single and Double Deer brand fuchou silk trademarks and falsely using their names. Luo and Pang have hired lawyers to file a criminal self-suit in the First Special District Local Court, requesting that they be punished according to law, and have also filed a private suit, demanding compensation for losses of silver 19,362 taels, in a major case of trademark forgery. The case is quite complex, and the court has held several hearings, but it has not yet concluded. The following is a summary of the content:</p>
<p>Luo and Pang Each Establish a Shop: Luo and Pang had previously partnered to open Jiucheng Fuchou Silk Shop, and used Single Deer and Double Deer as their trademarks. They successively registered patents with the Beijing Government and the National Government. Shen Zicha was originally an employee of Jiucheng, but later Luo and Pang split up and each ran a shop, both using the name Jiucheng, but Luo added Qiaji and Pang added Zhiji.</p>
<p>Shen Establishes Dafeng Silk Shop: After Luo and Pang split up, Shen joined Jin Liquan and others to establish Dafeng Silk Shop. He knew that Jiucheng's fuchou silk was selling very well and making excellent profits, so he counterfeited the trademarked goods and secretly sold them. Luo and others had heard about it for some time, but they had no evidence and did not negotiate with him.</p>
<p>Double Deer Fuchou Silk Discovered: On June 25th of this year, Luo Kunyang, a partner of Jiucheng Qiaji, delivered goods to the warehouse of French merchant Bo Xing Foreign Firm in the French Concession. He suddenly saw a large amount of Single and Double Deer brand fuchou silk stacked there, and the trademarks were all counterfeit. According to the manager of the foreign firm, Qi Qian, and the street vendor, Qiu Liansheng, they were sold by Dafeng.</p>
<p>Prices Lower Than Jiucheng's: Luo Kunyang reported this to the French Consul and requested that a search warrant be issued, ordering the French police to rush to the Bo Xing warehouse and seize 900 pieces of early-brand fuchou silk and store them in the French Consulate. He also went to Bo Xing Foreign Firm to investigate the account books and learned that since December of last year, more than 29,561 pieces of the brand fuchou silk had been shipped out, of which 21,010 pieces were marked as purchased from Dafeng. The prices were all lower than Jiucheng's.</p>
<p>Counterfeiting Names and Trademarks: Luo then reported this to the Public Concession police, who requested the First Special District Court to issue a warrant and send police to search Dafeng Silk Shop. They seized ten relevant account books and calculated that since last year, the total number of fuchou silk sold to Bo Xing was 25,764 pieces, of which 11,361 pieces were marked with Single Deer and Double Deer trademarks. The number of counterfeit goods of the brand was 34,134 pieces. In addition to counterfeiting the trademark, the advertisements were also counterfeiting the names of Jiu Zhiji and Pang Zhuqing. Therefore, they began to negotiate with Shen et al.</p>
<p>Two Parts of the Lawsuit: Shen claimed that the goods were purchased from Pang Chunsheng, a street vendor for Jiucheng Zhiji, and that he was reselling them to Bo Xing. He also said that Chunsheng was Pang Zhuqing's nephew. However, Pang Zhuqing absolutely denied having such a nephew, believing that Shen Jin was making excuses to evade responsibility. Therefore, they requested that he be punished according to law. As for the losses sought, they are divided into two parts: (1) The forged goods sold by the defendant amount to at least 34,134 pieces. Calculating the profit per piece at 2 taels, the compensation should be 68,268 taels. (2) Since the discovery of the counterfeit goods, the sales of Luo and Pang's shops have declined sharply. The loss suffered by each family is 100,000 taels. Therefore, at a minimum, compensation of 100,000 taels should be ordered. However, the defendant has also hired a lawyer to defend himself. The trial has concluded and a verdict is scheduled for next Monday.</p>
<p>After Lin Yunfang Fled</p>
<h3>Seized His Deposited Luggage</h3>

<p>Leather Suitcases Full of Clothes</p>
<p>Lin Yunfang, the director of the Jiangnan Shipyard of the Navy and a native of Guangdong, embezzled more than 110,000 yuan of public funds and fled secretly on August 4th. The shipyard reported the case and issued a wanted notice, but he has not been found yet. Zhang Zhiqin, the chief detective of the General Patrol Room, and Mei Sheng, the Western detective, discovered that Lin had two wooden boxes and six leather suitcases deposited with his friend Gao Dagang at No. 370 Haig Road. They requested the First Special District Court to issue a search warrant and seized the eight boxes from Gao's house the other day. Upon opening them, the wooden boxes were full of antiques and the leather suitcases were full of clothes, estimated to be worth about 5,000 to 6,000 yuan. Yesterday morning, the patrol room lawyer, Ru Baoyi, requested the court to dispose of them. Judge Xu Jiashi ordered that the seized clothes be detained for future compensation.</p>
<p>Shen Chengfu's Home</p>
<h3>Guns and Hunting Rifles Seized</h3>
<p>All Disposed of Separately by the Court</p>
<p>Shen Chengfu, a comprador of the British merchant Taihe Foreign Firm at No. 15 Bowuyuan Road, a native of Shaoxing, recently embezzled several million yuan of public funds and fled secretly. The firm reported the case to the police and requested the First Special District Court to issue a warrant for his arrest. The patrol room seized three of Shen's cars and requested the court to impound them, as reported in this newspaper. The other day, Geng Debiao, the Chinese detective of the General Patrol Room, and Huai Aituo, the Western detective, were ordered to search Shen's residence at No. 2, 1168F Jingansi Lane, Jingan Temple Road. They seized five pistols and 535 bullets, and two hunting rifles. They reported back to the patrol head, and yesterday morning, lawyer Ru Baoyi, representing the patrol room, applied to the First Criminal Court of the Special Court for disposal. According to lawyer Ru, the serial numbers of the five pistols seized were 609098, 3925, 68, 32475, and 2445. Among them, only 609098 had a license, and the rest were unlicensed. One of the two hunting rifles was deposited by Shen's colleague, a Westerner named Shelang Sikesiji. Therefore, they requested the court to decide how to dispose of them. Subsequently, Western detective Huai Aituo reported the search situation. Criminal Judge Xu Jiashi reviewed the report and ordered that one hunting rifle be returned to Shelang Sikesiji, and the licensed pistol and hunting rifle and documents should be detained. The unlicensed pistols and bullets should be confiscated and first handed over to the patrol room for inspection.</p>
<h3>Shangsong Road to Open Soon</h3>
<p>It Has Been Decided that the Beiwai Line Will Be Trial-Run Starting September 10th</p>
<p>The section of the Shangsong County Road from Beiqiao Station on the Shanghai-Min Road west to Weiqiao, about twelve li, is under the construction of Shanghai County. The construction of this item was completed early. From Weiqiao to the West Gate of Songjiang, about eighteen li, is under the construction of the Songjiang County Construction Bureau. They are now building bridges and paving roads, working hard. The Weiqiao, which is the border between Shangsong and Songjiang Counties, has been approved by the Construction Department to be jointly managed and will soon be started and built. The Shangsong Company, which contracted the road line, was organized and established early, and vehicles have been prepared for a long time. The stations along the way have been completed one after another. It was originally planned to run the entire road on August 1st, but due to the three-in-one earthworks and the Weiqiao project, it was slightly delayed. Yesterday, it was learned that the company's manager, Yin Shisheng, in order to consolidate the roadbed, which had been built with weeds, decided to first conduct a trial run of the Beiwai long-distance bus in early September to facilitate local transportation. Once the Weiqiao, jointly built by the two counties, is completed, the entire road will be open to traffic. It is said that the route is connected to the Songsijiao Road, and in the future, it will be able to reach Sheshan directly.</p>
<p>The Meaning of the Dongjiang Identity Case</p>
<p>In the case of lawyer Dong Yu and his wife Jiang's appeal for confirmation of identity, it was heard in the Jiangsu High Court on the 15th of this month. Because the witnesses were not complete, it was necessary to summon and examine them again. Zhang Yaozeng, the lawyer hired by Jiang, specially submitted a written argument. The following is a transcript:</p>
<p>Regarding the submission of a supplementary written argument, the appellant and Dong Yu's case for confirmation of identity and request for alimony has been debated by the court on the 15th of this month. The appellee, Dong Yu, stated that the Shanghai French Concession Court's judgment on July 8th approved the divorce of the two parties. According to Article 5 of the Annex to the Sino-French New Agreement, this matter has been determined, and the appellant has lost the qualification of the party. His agent also made the same statement in court and submitted a photo of the judgment of the French Concession Court as evidence. After the appellant filed a detailed rebuttal of the facts and the law, the matter is of great importance, and I am deeply afraid that the records at the time may not be detailed. I hereby submit the written arguments as follows: Part 1 Regarding the facts, in November of last year, the appellee, Dong Yu, filed a lawsuit in the Shanghai French Concession Court for divorce on the grounds that the appellant had lung disease. After several trials, in February of this year, the plaintiff, namely the appellee, suddenly applied to declare an indefinite postponement. The appellant wandered without a home and had no choice but to file a lawsuit in the Special District Local Court for confirmation of identity and separate maintenance. The court then lawfully transferred the case to the Shanghai Local Court for trial and judgment. The appellant refused to accept the judgment and appealed to the court in accordance with the law, and was waiting for the hearing. Suddenly, the French Concession Court reheard the original case, which had been suspended for a long time. The appellant immediately filed a statement, stating that the previous trial was only due to consideration of the treaty, but now that it belongs to the Jiangsu High Court, we respect Chinese law and it is difficult to respond to the trial. Repeated summonses were not answered. When the court opened the trial on July 21, the appellee did not attend for reasons and declared the debate closed. Then, he requested to reopen the debate. At the end of July, the Sino-French New Agreement was announced, and the appellee suddenly declared that the French Concession Court had already made a judgment and that it was now determined to be valid, and that the Jiangsu High Court would be unable to revive the case. The appellant was deeply shocked and inquired everywhere. The member of the court confirmed that all cases were judged uniformly at the end, so this case is known to be so, but since it was not served, nor was the time of the pronouncement of the judgment clearly indicated, on August 8, he submitted a presentation to the Third High Branch Court of Jiangsu, requesting service and declaring that he would reserve the appeal. This is the actual situation of the case. Among them, there are extremely noteworthy ones: (1) After the case was appealed to this court, the French Concession Court suddenly reheard the case, which had been declared suspended, obviously intending to resist the legal proceedings. (2) After reading the appellant's statement, the French Concession Court knew that the case was legally under the jurisdiction of the second-instance legal system, but still brazenly proceeded with the judgment, obviously disregarding Chinese legal rights. (3) The appellee's reply submitted after July 21 did not mention the judgment of the French Concession Court at all, so it is questionable whether the judgment was made on July 8. (4) Since the judgment of the French Concession Court has not been served, how could the appellee be able to obtain the full text of it alone, and be able to take a photo of the original? Part 2 Regarding the legal part, the appellee, relying on Article 5 of the Annex to the Sino-French Agreement on the Establishment of Chinese Courts in the Shanghai French Concession, argued that the divorce judgment of the French Concession Court has been determined and that this case cannot be established, which is a misunderstanding. The legal interpretation of Article 5 of the Annex refers specifically to cases in dispute in the French Concession Court. Those cases that are simultaneously in Chinese courts outside the French Concession and are proceeding legally are not included. There are three reasons for this: Article 5 of the Annex does not mean that all judgments of the French Concession Court have a determined effect, but limits those that are in dispute or have been suspended for a long time and are not subject to change. This is to maintain the stability of the legal relationship. The intent of this article, which excludes cases that have already been sued or can still be appealed, is very clear. Therefore, if the same legal relationship is in dispute in the French Concession Court and is also legally proceeding in the Chinese court, even if one side's French Concession Court has made a judgment, the other side's Chinese court proceedings are still in progress and have not been interrupted. The dispute relationship has not ended, there is no so-called reversal, and there is no reason to prohibit its progress. Therefore, it is naturally not subject to the application of this article, this is one. Article 5 of the Annex gives legal effect to the previous illegal judgments of the French Concession Court, and the intention is only this. There is absolutely no reason to overturn the previous legal procedures of the Chinese courts. Therefore, its application is naturally limited to cases that are tried in the French Concession Court and have not been involved in Chinese courts. If cases that are simultaneously involved in Chinese courts are also subject to application, this is to overturn the previous legal procedures, which is not the original intention of the legislation, this is two. According to the precedents of the former Dali Court and the customary laws of various courts, the judgments of the French Concession Court are invalid. All judgments of the French Concession Court are still accepted and judged when lawsuits are later filed in Chinese courts, so as to distinguish between legality and illegality and guide the people to follow. If Article 5 of the Annex is interpreted broadly, saying that cases that are simultaneously involved in the French Concession Court and the Chinese Court are also subject to application, then those who violated the law and acted arbitrarily in the past will be protected, and those who obeyed the law and sought justice will be ruined. How will the prestige of the national law be compared before and after, this is three. According to this case and the subject matter of the lawsuit requested by the appellee in the French Concession Court are different, but the facts and legal relationship in dispute are completely the same, and it is a case that is simultaneously involved in the French Concession Court and the Chinese Court. According to the above explanation, the progress of this case cannot be prevented due to the judgment of the French Concession Court. Furthermore, there is a big question as to whether the judicial organs can immediately invoke Article 5 of the Annex. In the past, although cases were judged by the French Concession Court, the parties could still freely file lawsuits in Chinese courts. Now, as a result of the provisions of Article 5, all those who could still file lawsuits in the courts in the past cannot file lawsuits because the judgment is valid. This is clearly a regulation restricting the people's right to sue. According to Article 21 of the Covenant, the people have the right to sue in the courts according to the law. If you want to restrict this right to sue, you must do so according to the law. Article 5 of the Annex is not the law. Some say that the treaty has the same effect as the law, and the annex to the agreement is a treaty, and it is not impossible to replace the law. However, the treaty has a certain form in international law. Regardless of whether the annex is clearly an exchange of notes and does not conform to the treaty form, even if its substance is a kind of treaty, according to Article 29 of the National Government Organization Law, the treaty case must be resolved by the Legislative Yuan. Now the annex has not yet been resolved by the Legislative Yuan, so it is known that it has not yet become a treaty. To use an exchange of notes that has not yet become a treaty to restrict the people's right to sue, which cannot be restricted without the law, is a violation of the Covenant. The judicial organs have the duty to maintain the law, and there is no obligation to invoke the rules that obviously violate the law. The above two items are stated according to the facts, and I beg the court to carefully investigate and make a fair judgment, which is for the benefit of morality. Respectfully presented to the Jiangsu High Court, the person presenting the case is Jiang Shi, agent lawyers Zhang Yaozeng, Yuan Jingtang, Sheng Shenghiu.</p>

<h3>Remaining News After the Big Storm</h3>
<p>The Eye of the Storm Fortunately Changed Direction</p>
<p>The Water Level of the Huangpu River Broke Records</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that the fierceness of this typhoon was the greatest of all the typhoons this summer. According to meteorological reports, between 9:00 and 10:00 PM on Tuesday night, its eye was originally heading directly for this port, but it suddenly encountered high pressure in the northwest and turned to the northeast, blowing through the mouth of the Yangtze River and Chongming, fifty or sixty miles from Shanghai. At that time, the wind speed reached 100 miles per hour. If it had not changed direction temporarily, its eye would have blown through Shanghai, and the loss of life and property would have been incalculable.</p>
<p>The North-China Daily News reported that the water level of the Huangpu River on Tuesday night broke the highest record of 1921. According to the water gauge in the Bund Park, the water level of the Huangpu River on August 20 of that year was 14.3 feet higher than the lowest water line. This time it was 14.8 feet higher than the lowest water line. The total amount of loss this time is still unestimated, but it is expected not to be too large, and the damage caused by street flooding will be the main one. It is also said that 300 trees were blown down on the Shanghai Municipal Council's property inside and outside the concession, and the situation in the French Concession was roughly the same.</p>

<h3>Two People Died from Electrocution One After Another</h3>
<p>Worker and Rickshaw Puller</p>
<p>In the front days on Lujiazhai Road, Zhabei, a power line was blown down by the wind and fell on the ground. A man who looked like a worker in his thirties passed by and was electrocuted to the ground. At that time, a rickshaw puller Wu Linju passed by and saw the man fall on the ground. He did not know that he was electrocuted, so he pulled him with his hand, which caused the electricity to pass through his body, and he was also paralyzed to death by the electric current. The Five District Police Station ordered the local guarantor Yan Liugen to report the case to the local court for autopsy. Prosecutor Wang and others arrived at the scene and separately verified and clarified that they should be collected and buried.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Puller Hangs Himself on a Tree</h3>
<p>The Deceased's Wife Claims He Was Driven to It by a Police Officer's Debt Collection</p>
<p>Yao Xiangzhou, a 26-year-old from Funing, resided in Hengkang Lane, Guangzhou Road, Zhabei, and worked as a rickshaw puller. Yesterday, at 12:20 PM, in front of No. 23 Wangjia Sha, he used his own belt to hang himself from a tree. After being discovered, a report was made to the Xinzha Police Station, which dispatched detectives to investigate. They found Yao hanging from the tree, about three to four feet off the ground, with rickshaw No. 3240 parked below. He was taken down, but was already dead. The body was transported to the Philand Road morgue. Yesterday morning, Guo Wei, a prosecutor from the First Special District Court, along with forensic doctor Wei Ligong and clerk Liu Chun, arrived to examine the body. Yao Zhou, the deceased's wife, testified, stating that her husband had borrowed five yuan from Chinese police officer No. 1481 in April, and had been gradually paying it back, but still owed over twenty cents. In the past few days, her husband had been unable to pull a rickshaw due to illness. The night before, her husband went out to pull the rickshaw, but the officer insisted on him returning the debt. Her husband had no money, so the officer took away his license, which she believed led to his suicide. However, she did not know about the hanging at the time. Prosecutor Guo then declared that Yao Xiangzhou had indeed died by hanging himself. The body was released to his wife, Yao Zhou, for burial.</p>
<h3>Husband and Wife Quarrel, Wife Hangs Herself</h3>
<p>Wang Bu Xing, the second son of Wang Kaitian, a native of Taizhou, resided at No. 18 Chenjia Zhai, Miaotou, South Railway Station. He was married to Wang Yang, 24 years old. The affection between husband and wife was not strong, and they often quarreled. The other day, they argued again over a trivial matter. The woman felt deeply resentful, returned to her room, and wept. Shortly after, she hanged herself. By the time she was discovered and attempts were made to save her, it was too late. Yesterday, the First Section of the First District summoned Wang and others for questioning, and ordered the head of the twelfth tu to report to the local court for an examination. Prosecutor Yang and others arrived at the scene and confirmed that it was a suicide by hanging. They ordered the family to collect the body for burial pending further investigation.</p>
<h3>Xu Yueqin Commits Suicide by Smoking Opium</h3>
<p>Xu Yueqin, a Guangdong woman, 18 years old, lived with her brother Xu Shijiu and others at No. 2 Baochang Road, Zhabei. Recently, she had been betrothed to someone, but Yueqin, being of a romantic nature, still went out to play frequently. Her brother Xu Shijiu repeatedly advised her against it. The other day, because Yueqin returned late at night, Shijiu scolded her. Yueqin, in a moment of anger, secretly consumed opium in order to commit suicide. Her brother noticed and immediately rushed her to Guangren Hospital for treatment, but because she had taken the poison for too long, the treatment was ineffective and she soon died. The hospital notified the Hongkou Police Station, which dispatched detectives to send the body to the Philand Road morgue. A report was filed with the First Special District Court, which sent Prosecutor Guo and others to the morgue to confirm that the death was due to poisoning. They ordered her brother, Xu Shijiu, to collect the body for burial pending review.</p>
<h3>Only Recognizes Her Brother, Not Her Husband</h3>
<p>The Personal Dispute Between Zhao Yu and Zhao Jianzhuo</p>
<p>Zhao Yu, 22-year-old wife of Zhao Jianfu from Fuyang, secretly fled to Shanghai at the end of the fourth lunar month last year and hid at No. 19 Wanzhu Road. Recently, Zhao's nephew, Shichang, sent a letter to his uncle, who came to Shanghai yesterday and took Yu to the First Section of the Second District to be investigated and to request that Yu be ordered to return home with her husband. According to Zhao Yu, "I have been Zhao Jianfu's adopted daughter since I was a child. Zhao Jianfu is my brother, not my husband, so I do not want to return home with Jianfu." As the case involved a marital dispute, Zhao was instructed to file a lawsuit in court himself.</p>
<h3>Robbery of a Rice Boat</h3>
<p>Searching for Silver: Beating People: Cargo</p>
<p>Ji Weixiang, a rice merchant, recently sold rice he had brought from Songjiang in Shanghai, earning over two thousand yuan. He planned to return and used the money to buy 500 bags of flour. He had more than 600 yuan left, which he divided into two packages and hid under the stove before setting sail. The other day, while sailing in Desheng, a hurricane suddenly broke out, so he anchored at the edge of the river to shelter from the wind. Unexpectedly, the next morning, a pirate ship arrived with seven or eight bandits, who swarmed onto the boat. They asked the watchmen what was going on and then tied them up, gagging them with cloth. The bandits got off the ship. Ji woke up from his sleep, shouting and was threatened by the bandits who pulled out guns, preventing him from making noise. They forced Ji to hand over the silver, but he refused. He was beaten and injured. Ji, in unbearable pain, had to reveal where the silver was hidden. After the bandits searched under the stove and found the silver, they beat Ji again, considering him extremely cunning, forcing him to reveal if there was silver elsewhere. Ji said there was no silver anywhere else. The bandits searched Ji's body and took away another sixty or seventy yuan and a watch. Before leaving, they also took more than twenty bags of flour, loaded them onto the pirate ship, and sailed south in a hurry. After the bandits left, some of the crew untied the watchmen. Ji sailed the boat back to Minhang and sent the injured crew to the hospital for treatment. It is said that the crew were seriously injured and unable to speak, and Ji also suffered internal injuries and was vomiting blood.</p>

After the owner reported it to the police station, Detective Bao discovered and arrested Shen, along with the stolen hams. Yesterday, he was sent to the Summary Court of the Second Special District for questioning. First, the police lawyer explained the case, and the owner complained about the theft. When questioned, Shen admitted that he stole the salted meat due to poverty. He said that all the money he got had been gambled away. Judge Wu Fanglian verified the confession and immediately sentenced the defendant to two months of imprisonment. The number of days detained before the verdict will be counted as two days to offset one day of imprisonment.</p>
<h3>Westerner's Chinese Servant Missing</h3>
<p>Zhang Desen, a native of Fengtian, who worked as a Chinese servant for a Westerner at No. 50 Shanzhong Road in the French Concession, was hired in Fengtian. Because he was trusted and favored by his master, he came to Shanghai. However, Zhang was addicted to opium and liked to gamble. He suddenly disappeared between the seventeenth and eighteenth of this month. His Western master sent people out to search for him everywhere, but could not find him, and was very anxious. He has now reported to the police station to investigate. If anyone knows the whereabouts of Zhang, please report to the French Police Station or his employer's house.</p>

<h3>Abduction Case Aboard the Lushan Maru</h3>
<p>Xu Cuizhen, Young and Deceived</p>
<p>Pan Afu, Deserves to Die</p>
<p>Xu Cuizhen, a young woman from Hangzhou, 18 years old, married Lao Xu, who lived near the train station, last year. Because her family was poor and could not make a living, she came to Shanghai to work as a helper, living at her uncle's house in Xujiahui. Not even three days had passed. The other day, while going out to buy cigarettes, she was met by the kidnapper Pan Afu (50 years old, from Wenzhou), who used his means of seducing women to lure Xu Cuizhen to a inn and had intercourse with her for one night, feigning affection and vowing to be husband and wife, boasting of his wealthy family in Wenzhou, so she would not have to suffer back in Hangzhou. Cuizhen, deceived by him, deeply believed him. Pan then colluded with Chen Axi to take Cuizhen aboard the Lushan Maru steamer to Xiamen for sale, telling the woman that they were returning to his home in Wenzhou to live as husband and wife forever. If anyone questioned them, they would say they were husband and wife. However, before the ship set sail, investigators Chen Shaoting and Lin Yongfang from the Relief Society, along with police detective Deng Jiagen from the Water Police Station, boarded the ship and questioned Cuizhen. She only said she was going to Wenzhou, and the rest of her answers were inconsistent. The investigators knew that she was being abducted, and that Pan was 50 years old and Xu was 18 years old, which was an unlikely match. The language spoken in Wenzhou and Hangzhou was different, and Axi was not a relative. They were all taken to the Water Police Station and questioned. The truth immediately came out. Yesterday, they were transferred to the local court for questioning.</p>

At 6:10 PM the other night, Ge Changsheng, a detective from the Customs Water Police Station, boarded the ship and discovered it, arresting Zheng and Fu together. They were taken to the police station. Zheng, 40 years old, from Ningbo, and Fu, 22 years old, from Ningbo, both confessed to smuggling opium paste for profit. The police chief ordered all the opium paste to be handed over to the customs for burning, and the two criminals will be sent to the local court for questioning.</p>

<h3>Letters</h3>
<p>To the Editor of Shen Bao,</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>I have just read a news item in the local news section of your newspaper, stating that our company's Guangli steamer ran aground and sank near Qingdao on the 24th of this month. This is not true. We have just received a telegram from our Dalian head office stating that the ship is safely in Andong. We are writing to request that you correct the record. We wish you peace and happiness. Respectfully, Zhengji Shipping Company, August 27, Noon.</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>I have just read a correction by Yichangxing in your "Letters" column, which involves me. This does not correspond with the facts. On the 18th of this month, Yichangxing had a misunderstanding with District Chief Wu. The Chamber of Commerce, based on the report from that company, etc., convened a general meeting of members. At the time, Jingling did not participate in any comments. Because the attendance was not sufficient for a quorum, the resolution could not be established. A provisional resolution was attempted in accordance with regulations. The next day, an executive and supervisory meeting was convened, originally intending to remedy the situation legally, to avoid the Chamber of Commerce violating the law. The original letter from that company suspected that Jingling was biased because he also served as an accountant at the District Office, which was a misunderstanding. Fortunately, the facts are all there and don't require Jingling to argue. I fear that the rumors are untrue, so I am writing to request publication in the "Letters" column, granting a correction to clarify the truth. Respectfully, Zhang Jingling, Acting Chairman of the Minhang Chamber of Commerce, August 26.</p>

<h3>What is the Effectiveness of Supplementary Education?</h3>
<p>Jiang Wenyu (1)</p>
<p>Generally speaking, supplementary education is primarily designed for young people who have graduated from primary school, are unable to continue their education due to financial constraints, and are currently engaged in agricultural, industrial, or commercial occupations. The purpose is to use their spare time after work to supplement them with the necessary knowledge and skills for their occupations, as well as scientific common sense related to their occupations. At the same time, considerable guidance is also given to the moral and service ethics of citizens who are working to make a living. Because the targets of this type of education are young people serving in the workforce, and the supplementary curriculum focuses on the inculcation and training of occupational knowledge and skills, it is often classified within the scope of vocational education in the educational system, or simply referred to as (vocational supplementary education).</p>
<p>If we briefly examine the history of supplementary education in modern civilized countries, the initial facilities were generally as described above. However, things have gradually changed in recent years. Because the educational trend is towards popularization, the educational system is also moving towards socialization. Therefore, from a horizontal perspective, everyone should be able to receive higher education. From a vertical perspective, it is natural to gradually improve the level of this informal supplementary education, and we absolutely do not want the right to education to be monopolized by a small number of people. Without discussing European and American countries, let's take Japan as an example. In recent years, the (subject system) of supplementary education has gradually evolved into the (academic year system). In the past, supplementary education mostly aimed to specialize in one or two subjects. Once a subject was completed, the education was considered finished. And so-called certain subjects were mostly limited to occupations, but recently, they are no longer entirely limited to subjects. Many have been changed to (academic year,) which means that in addition to specializing in occupational subjects, they also pay attention to other cultural education subjects, in order to provide students with complete training, so that they can both make a living and be good people. Therefore, the focus is now on academic years rather than (subjects). Not only that, but as with the youth training center approach, in addition to occupational training and personal cultivation, more attention is paid to military training, which is especially a special type of supplementary education. When it comes to the curriculum, it is divided into several levels, the lowest equivalent to the early stages of middle school, and the highest exceeding middle school and approaching the initial stages of specialized subjects. When we see the situation in one place in Japan, it is not difficult to infer the situation in other countries. Originally, (nothing is difficult in the world, as long as you have the will.) Despite growing up in a poor family, being unable to continue schooling after primary school graduation, and immediately becoming an apprentice in a shop or factory, being able to study for two or three hours every day after work, continuously for eight or ten years, their level may not be inferior to that of a high school graduate, and may not be inferior to the first or second year of a specialized school. I think, as long as there is an institution that provides this kind of education, there will definitely be this kind of hardworking and outstanding youth. Isn't this already a trend in Japan now? Furthermore, university lectures and night universities can also be included in the scope of supplementary education. Didn't a worker who graduated from primary school in England, because he received supplementary education and went to university lectures, listen for many years, and become a minister in a certain department once the cabinet was reorganized? Everyone, please don't look down on this (unorthodox) unofficial education. You must know that there are quite a few talented and capable people who did not come from formal channels.</p>
<p>Speaking of our China, formal school education has not yet been popularized, and has not yet been done properly. It has even caused many bad phenomena in society because of the existence of schools, causing the general public to be heartbroken. How can we even talk about informal school education or supplementary education? However, my opinion is not like this. I believe that because formal school education has not been popularized, because formal school education has not been done well, and because society is dissatisfied with the current schools, supplementary education should be given special attention, using it to make up for the shortcomings and solve various difficulties. Therefore, in recent years, I have often discussed with friends the current educational problems in China. Everyone sighs and believes that all kinds of problems have arisen. Finally, I strongly advocate for supplementary education, saying that in today's China, it has the effect of curing (educational illnesses) and is worth promoting by everyone. I remember that I had a nearly arbitrary statement:</p>
<p>Important News</p>
<p>Jiangsu Province</p>
<p>All Counties Pay Attention to Teacher In-Service Training</p>
<p>The education bureaus of various counties in Jiangsu Province, in order to promote the popularization of education, should pay close attention to teacher training, in order to expand the quantity and ensure the quality. Since 1929, the various counties in Jiangsu have been preparing for the Joint Office for Compulsory Education, and have established correspondence departments for teacher training. On the one hand, unqualified teachers are engaged in in-service training and tutoring, making it easier to participate in certification exams (and those with excellent results can also serve as primary school principals or teachers). It has been found that there are 11,673 unqualified teachers in the teacher registration of various counties, exceeding half of the teacher quota. On the other hand, qualified teachers can instill new knowledge and improve their educational efficiency through the interaction of teaching and learning. This training graduates in one year, which is quite cost-effective and yields great benefits. The Ministry of Education has specially praised it, and the education departments of Zhejiang and Fujian provinces have also followed suit. The department is now recruiting the third batch of students. All the lecture notes on teaching methods are checked against the new curriculum standards recently established by the Ministry of Education and re-edited. Therefore, most of the members of the curriculum standards committee are also editors and instructors of the department, so they can connect with each other. Each course of lecture notes is attached with detailed homework guidance and reference materials, using methods such as questions and answers, tests, surveys, visits, and practical exercises to conduct thorough research. All participating students should register with the education bureau, and each county has also established subsidy and incentive research methods, assigning teachers to participate according to the school district. The registration period for students from other provinces and counties is extended to the end of September.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Authorities Emphasize Fisheries Education</h3>
<p>Starting with Training Talents</p>
<p>China's fishing industry adheres to outdated methods and does not know how to improve, causing the East adjacent countries to constantly invade coastal areas, causing frequent disputes. Recently, the Department of Agriculture and Mines of Jiangsu Province, in view of this, has specifically formulated the Jiangsu Provincial Fisheries Guidance Personnel Training Measures, and has recruited two fisheries trainees at the Jiangsu Provincial Fisheries Experiment Site in Xiaobeimen, Shanghai, specifying that they are limited to those with Chongming and Guanyun county registration, because the fishing profits of the two counties are very large and are often seized by the Japanese. If we do not remedy it quickly, we will be unable to recover. The fisheries guidance stations attached to the agricultural improvement sites in Nantong, Rugao, Yancheng, and Changshu counties also recruit two people in each county for training. High school graduates with aspirations can send letters to the Shanghai Fisheries Experiment Site or the county sites to request detailed regulations. It is heard that the training method is set for two to three years, stipulating that there are two months of lessons each year, totaling 288 hours, and two months of assisting work and eight months of practice. The Jiangsu Provincial Education Bureau also established a fisheries village normal school at the old site of the Guanyun Xugou Fisheries Training Institute (the starting point of the eastern section of the Longhai Railway) this year, because the fishing villages are vast and there is no education to speak of. The qualifications for admission are the same as for ordinary rural teachers, and the entrance examination will be held on September 1 and 2 at the Haizhou Donghai Middle School headquarters.</p>

<h3>Periodic Memorial for Chen Hangshu</h3>
<p>At the Chinese Science Society at 1 PM on the 30th</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Hangshu, former secretary and lecturer of Guanghua University, went to France in the 16th year of the Republic of China (1927) to specialize in economics at the University of Paris. He suddenly contracted peritonitis and passed away in the hospital on May 3rd of this year. His friends He Bingsong, Pan Gongzhan, Wu Songgao, He Zhongchi, Ma Chonggan, and others have arranged a memorial service to be held at 2 PM on the afternoon of the 30th of this month (Sunday) at the Mingfu Library Hall of the Chinese Science Society on Albert Road, Avenue See Ahms, in the French Concession of this city. A brief biography of Mr. Chen is recorded below:</p>
<p>Mr. Chen, given name Xunshu, courtesy name Hangshu, surname Chen, was from Zixi, Zhejiang. He was exceptionally intelligent from a young age. At the age of thirteen, he graduated from a village school and entered Xiaoshi Middle School in the county seat. In the tenth year of the Republic of China (1921), he entered St. John's University in Shanghai to study economics and political science. In the summer of the fourteenth year of the Republic of China (1925), the May Thirtieth Incident occurred, and the British president of St. John's University, Bu Fangji, prohibited students from participating in the movement. The entire faculty and students left the school in anger and organized a post-departure committee. Mr. Chen devoted himself to writing and publicity. Later, in the establishment of Guanghua University, Mr. Chen's efforts in planning and organization were considerable. After the new school was completed, he served as secretary to the president and taught political science, comparative political science, and other courses. In November of that year, he married Ms. Hong Shulang. The following year, he went to France to study economics at the University of Paris, also studying social history and other subjects. The Academia Sinica heard of his reputation and invited him to be a researcher at the Institute of Social Sciences. Mr. Chen declined with humility. In the summer of the nineteenth year of the Republic of China (1930), Mr. Chen went to Germany to study German for half a year before returning to France. In March of this year, he suffered from diarrhea and abdominal pain. Doctors diagnosed it as anemia, but later discovered that his lungs and intestines were also affected. He then moved to a sanatorium in the 14th arrondissement of Paris for treatment, but it was ineffective, and he passed away on May 3rd at the young age of twenty-six.</p>

<h3>German National Games</h3>
<p>Amazing Track and Field Results | Worthy of Being a World-Class Enemy | Triple Jump Not as Good as Our Country</p>
<p>(Berlin Correspondence) Germany is preparing to participate in next year's World Games, so it held the National Games at the Freyenc Shevat Sports Ground in Berlin on August 1st and 2nd. The most noteworthy aspect was the track and field competition results. Although Belz, who holds the world middle-distance record, and Yanlu, who holds the short-distance record (100 meters in 10.3 seconds), did not participate, the rapid progress of the general youth is enough to be a strong enemy in the world next year. The United States and the United States shared courtesy, and the best of all achievements should be promoted to close to the world record. The 1,500 meters is the most outstanding, with a time of only three minutes and fifty-seven seconds and six five thousand meters, ten thousand meters and marathon long-distance running have considerable status in the world. However, the 100-meter and 200-meter are not good, and are not as good as the previous Far East results. The iron throwing in the three irons has a score of 15 meters and 56, which is also a rare record in the world. The worst is the four-jump score in the field competition, which is slightly inferior to Japan. The triple jump is not as good as our country. The remaining ten high-bar, middle-bar, and relay are all close to the world record. Considering the strength of Kodmei, each has its own strengths. It is unpredictable who will die in the future. We can try to wait and see the competition between the two countries on the world stage next year. The track and field results of the German National Games are recorded below.</p>

<h3>World Tidbits</h3>
<p>—Hai Ke</p>
<p>Astounding Medical Expenses</p>
<p>The King of Siam, suffering from cataracts in his left eye, traveled all the way from Bangkok, Siam, to New York, USA, for medical treatment. He engaged a most famous ophthalmologist to treat him. There are five or six specialist doctors in America whose annual income totals between £100,000 and £150,000. Now, the income of this doctor who is treating the King of Siam’s eye is also similar. And for the sake of serious work, it is bound to abandon other diagnoses, specializing in serving the King of Siam alone, his loss. Of course, the King of Siam has to compensate him. Previously, a wealthy tycoon paid a famous surgeon Mr. So-and-so as much as £50,000 for an operation. So the King of Siam’s expenses will be at least that much. In addition, there are two nurses each for day and night care, an anaesthesia expert, and some assistants, costing about £16,000. The term of treatment is two months. Renting a mansion costs about £60,000. The round-trip travel expenses from Siam to America for the King and Queen and 160 attendants is at least £70,000. Plus all miscellaneous daily expenses, the total is set at £250,000. Therefore, the King of Siam’s medical expenses this time are unprecedented in history. But the monarchs of the East are mostly wealthy, so these medical expenses of £250,000 may not be taken to heart.</p>

<p>This time, the floods in our country have spread to 16 or 17 provinces. Among them, the three towns of Wuhan have suffered the most severe disaster. The details have been repeatedly seen in the newspapers. Yesterday, a friend came to Shanghai from Hankow to avoid the disaster. During our conversation, he told me everything. I selected what the outside world does not know and sent it to this column.</p>
<p>Knee-deep in water in an instant. For more than a month, Hankow has been suffering from heavy rain. However, because the embankment work is very solid, the people are at peace. One morning, my friend went to the market for tea. When he came out an hour later, he heard people saying that the embankment had collapsed. At that time, he still did not believe it. But after walking less than half a mile, he saw water in the barracks of the military police. Before long, a torrent rushed in and was unstoppable. He hurriedly hired a car to return home. The water was already several inches deep. He saw the river water pouring in and quickly rose more than a foot. Only then did he realize that a great disaster was coming, and he could not help but lose his color.</p>
<p>Buried in the belly of fish still in a dream. Many people in Hankow are addicted to opium. Most addicts cannot sleep until early in the morning. The day the dike broke coincided with the morning, and the momentum was fierce, so that some people were swept away by the flood in their sleep. It is said to be tragic.</p>
<p>Rickshaws also have first class. I once saw in a humorous novel that a villager was visiting Shanghai for the first time. When he took a rickshaw, he squatted under the seat, saying that he was sitting in third class. This time, the water level in Hankow rose, and the rickshaw pullers' livelihood was prosperous for a while. Later, as the water level rose, the lower part of the rickshaw was submerged in water. The passengers sat on the hood of the car, which was called first class. When traveling, it was pushed and pulled by two rickshaw pullers, the price was extremely high, and the action was slow. It is also a strange sight. Most of those who do not care about riding in first-class cars can only walk barefoot. However, the water level continued to rise to six or seven feet or even more than a foot. Even first-class cars could not be taken. The suffering can be imagined.</p>
<p>Boats come and go as if entering Venice. After the rickshaws disappeared, they were followed by boats. There were 5,000 boats registered with the municipal government. For a time, the streets became rivers. Boats came and went, as if entering the water city of Venice. The streets were not very wide, and the boats were crowded, colliding from time to time. Each boat needs two boatmen to operate. White flags are inserted on the boats, which is very interesting to look at from a distance.</p>
<p>Easy to go upstairs, difficult to go downstairs. As the water level continues to rise, residents of bungalows can no longer live in peace. They have moved into the most famous five-story hotel in Hankow, hoping to resist the water demon. Unfortunately, it collapsed a few days ago, drowning hundreds of people. As a result, people are afraid to go upstairs again. However, the water in the bungalows is several feet deep, and they cannot sleep peacefully. They are in a dilemma, and their embarrassment can be imagined.</p>
<p>Pouring night soil from the windows. After the flood, the food problem of the citizens caused various difficulties. However, it was also difficult to discharge urine and feces. The municipal government sends boats to collect manure from various places every day. Residents pour it down from the windows of the buildings, mostly into the water, or even on the boatmen. The streets and canals are so unclean, and the bodies are floating on the sea. After a long time, they become foul-smelling. The stronger the sunlight, the more unbearable it becomes. The people of Hankow are really like they are in the eighteenth level of hell.</p>
<p>Famine-stricken victims waiting to be fed. The Pinghan Railway is relatively high, and the victims rely on it as a habitat. However, it has become precarious in recent days. The cries of the victims are unbearable to hear. Now, the relief society sends boats to distribute buns every day. However, there is not enough porridge for many monks, and it is of no avail. If there is no way to retreat the water, the people will perish together. Except for rice shops, which are not allowed to close, and are forced to open, the rest of the city is closed.</p>
<p>Wuchang also becomes a huge flood. When the river water in Hankow entered the city, Wuchang was still safe. Therefore, the relief society had moved some of the victims to Wuchang for temporary residence. However, the dikes in Wuchang also broke after a while, so that there was nothing to do. The wharves of various ships can no longer be seen. It is necessary to rely on boats to board the ships. The ships are extremely crowded. My friend returned in a panic, unable to find a place to sit. Fortunately, the foreign shipping company still has a conscience and has not increased the price.</p>
<p>The failure to repair water conservancy projects has led to huge disasters. Hankow originally had special funds for embankment construction. In recent years, the responsible personnel have been following the same old routine, resulting in an irreversible situation. Although there is a slight punishment now, what will be paid for the sacrifice of thousands of people and the loss of tens of millions of dollars? The people of Hubei will have serious expressions to the Director of the Construction Department.</p>
<h3>Special Remuneration</h3>
<p>— Chou Cheng</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Taiyan's son, Zhang Qishi, is only seven years old, but his calligraphy is already elegant and he can write screen strips. This is enough to show the family's academic background. A tiger does not have a dog son. The other day, I went to visit Mr. Taiyan because of something and saw a piece of paper posted in the guest hall with Zhang Qi's writing rules. He does not accept money, but values stationery and toys. It broke the new record of remuneration and is also a good story in the art world. Without naming it, it is called a special lubrication. Here is a special transcription as follows. The four big characters of the writing rules of Shangshu Zhang Qi are written. The middle section is divided into two items: pieces and rewards. (Couplets) A small airplane. Two large notebooks of foreign stationery. A small train. (Screen strips) A Parker fountain pen. (Horizontal scroll) Top-notch a dozen pencils. The four characters "Zhang Qi respectfully ordered" are written below.</p>
<h3>Building the Former Residence of Yunlin</h3>
<p>— Li Yuyi</p>
<p>Mr. Ni Yunlin was one of the four great painters of the Yuan Dynasty. He lived in Changdaxia, Dongxiang, Wuxi. He was rich and a strong resister of matter. His former residence, Zhituo, now only has a temple. The Qingbi Pavilion, which was once famous at home and abroad for its rich collection of books and paintings, is also nowhere to be found. Only mulberry ridges and rice fields can be seen. However, the legacy of legends is worth recording.</p>
<p>Since ancient times, Yunlin's paintings have been praised for their sparseness, lightness, and remoteness, and are listed as Yi products. Now, looking at the scenery of his residence, tall pines and slender bamboos are planted among the fields. Rivers, streams, and swamps are hidden among the forests. Above, it is reflected in the vast sky and light clouds. Yunlin's sparseness, lightness, and remoteness are also Yunlin's sparseness, lightness, and remoteness. It is natural and there is no doubt.</p>
<p>Mr. Yunlin loved tung trees and washed them every day. The wild old man passed on words that his tung tree was spit on by an immortal, so the tung juice is still sticky today. Beside his former residence, there is a dead tree like an ape. The villagers said that it must be inhabited by gods because it has not rotted for a long time.</p>
<p>In front of it, there is a short stream called Xiazhao River. The water quality is 20% heavier than other places, just like Huiquan. It is clear and bottomless. The snails produced are all covered with silky green hair. Further ahead, there are two ancient pines, like the Six Dynasties pines of Zhongda and Mao. All of these are named after Mr.</p>
<p>The farmers in his residence are all named Ni, totaling hundreds of families. Regardless of wealth or poverty, the house style is to build a wide hall in the three-entry house. There are nineteen plaques of chastity and filial piety on the hall. And it is not surprising to have two or three parties. The custom of women keeping festival is a strange thing.</p>
<p>I worked at the factory's aesthetic appreciation society at the home of my close friend Mr. Ni Xiaoqian. I saw that there were also two plaques in his hall. It turns out that two generations of his ancestors have kept their chastity. From this, it can be inferred that there are more women than men in that place and they are healthy. It is said in our country that the rich give birth to more daughters and the poor give birth to more sons. Based on today's statistical research, it is also confirmed. The reason why there are so many women in that place is because of its wealth. In addition to rice, wheat, and miscellaneous grains, the benefits of sericulture are added. Silkworms can be raised in spring and autumn. The old and young have their own duties. Chaste women concentrate their efforts on this. Life is abundant and there is no other thought. And keeping festival and being good can reduce fertility, which is beneficial to the population problem. For thousands of years, hundreds of families with the surname Ni have not been overcrowded. It can be used as proof. As for Yunlin's paintings, those who get natural are not only inspired by the scenery.</p>
<p>His affluent life, with enough food and clothing, is the biggest cause of art. Or, it is thought that the essence of art comes from a strong spirit. Would it be delusional to think of this?</p>
<h3>Travelogue of India (93)</h3>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>All young children are nurtured in their mother's embrace and grow up by their mother's hand. From the womb, they are raised by the holy spirit, and as they grow, they are constantly protected, forming a second nature. How difficult it is for women to separate from the divine, and how difficult it is to eradicate worldly religions. Observing the waters of the Ganges, I recall the King of Persia's words to the Buddha in the Surangama Sutra: "I remember at the age of three, my loving mother took me to visit the Jiva God and see the waters of the Ganges." This confirms that Indians are nurtured in the embrace of the divine, hence their deep sense of gratitude towards their mothers. On the way back from the Ganges, I saw many women holding children, all with foreheads marked with five colors, commemorating their baptism in the holy water.</p>
<p>We passed many small temples, all guarded by women. Pilgrims come to offer incense and give money. I don't know if they are female nuns or not. But from what I know, there are three irresistible forces in the world: power, money, and love between the sexes. All are difficult to resist. Although Hinduism is extremely profound and far-reaching, cases of its monks having illegitimate children, returning to secular life, or engaging in love affairs are frequently seen and still require lawyers to resolve. Each temple has monks and also women, who are said to be their disciples. But in reality, many cases occur. I have read widely in religious history and know that talking about principles too high and not in accordance with human life is bound to fail. This is why the monastic system is an exception and difficult to be the norm. We passed a large park, magnificently structured with beautiful flowers and plants.</p>
<p>At 5 p.m. that afternoon, I lectured at the Anglo-Bengalee Intermediate College, Allahabad, a joint university of two provinces. The vice-principal, Mr. Asthana, presided, and there were only about a hundred listeners. In India, large gatherings of thousands or even tens of thousands of people are very common. This proves that the Buddha's sermons with eighteen thousand disciples present are not exaggerated, as some Chinese think. Such large gatherings are still commonly seen in India. Indians' love of learning and wisdom is worthy of being the first teachers and leaders in the world. The small number of listeners today was because the lecture was announced only three hours before it started, students had already dispersed for the New Year, and it was also a market closing day, with Gandhi's followers engaged in a major national movement. Asthana is a famous person in the province, and many students asked me questions, all of which I was able to answer. Their love of learning is admirable. Before I finished my lecture, Gandhi's followers were shouting slogans on the street outside, parading through the city. The lights were already on. Around 6 p.m., the meeting ended, and I followed the crowd to observe Gandhi's movement. Men and women came in single file, holding Indian flags of various sizes, or carrying wooden sticks, or with lit lamps on their heads, or with incense. The men wore Gandhi caps, made of coarse white cloth, slightly pointed in the front, exactly like the large white mourning caps in China. There was no difference at all. They went to a large park that could hold thirty to forty thousand people, shouting loudly with tears in their eyes, because their relatives and children had been harmed in prison. I don't understand Indian languages, but hearing their voices, even now as I write this, I can't help but feel sorrow for them. The women's speeches were particularly inspiring. In Allahabad alone, there were 30,000 people participating in the movement. I heard that in every city and town across India, large and small, similar movements were taking place today. It can be said to be a magnificent sight. Indians regard Gandhi as a living Buddha today. An Indian told me that the British dare not harm Gandhi. If they did, a major riot would erupt, and it could immediately turn into a communist-style revolution. If they use gentleness, the Indians might still be able to tolerate it.</p>
<h3>Random Notes on a Northeast Inspection Tour (4)</h3>
<p>— Liu Suiqiu</p>
<p>(5) The Origin of the Siku Quanshu in the Wensu Pavilion</p>
<p>During Emperor Qianlong's inspection tours, the Wensu Pavilion was established in Shenyang to house the Siku Quanshu (Complete Library of the Four Treasuries). Today, Fengtian (Shenyang) still possesses a complete copy of the Siku Quanshu, a gift from the Qing Emperor's eastern tour. The front part of the current Wensu Pavilion serves as the location of the Liaoning Provincial Education Association. To visit the Siku Quanshu, one must obtain permission and an introduction from the association or the provincial government. This spring, I accompanied Mr. Wang Huayi, the vice-chairman of the association, to browse through it once. I heard someone say that Fengtian had planned to reprint the Siku Quanshu a few years ago and had already printed a sample in Western-style binding. The Secretary-General of the European League of Nations, Mr. Eric Drummond, was willing to undertake the sale of many copies and requested to see the sample. Upon seeing the Western-style binding, he was displeased and directly told Zhang Xueliang that Westerners did not like this type of binding. Later, due to other reasons, the project was shelved.</p>
<p>(6) Imperial Literary Works</p>
<p>Another byproduct of the Qing emperors' inspection tours to Shenyang is the Shengjing Fu (Ode to Shengjing), an imperial literary work. Last year, I had the opportunity to see Emperor Qianlong's edition in the Fengtian Library. Upon inspection, the content of the Shengjing Fu written by Emperor Qianlong consists of thirty-two types of seal script in Chinese and thirty-two types of seal script in Manchu. The library has eight sets of thirty-two volumes in Chinese and eight sets of twenty-five volumes in Manchu. The thirty-two types of Chinese seal script are:</p>
<p>1. Jade Chopstick Seal Script 2. Curious Character Seal Script 3. Greater Seal Script 4. Lesser Seal Script</p>
<p>5. Upper Greater Seal Script 6. Hanging Needle Seal Script 7. Sui Script Seal Script 8. Willow Leaf Seal Script</p>
<p>9. Inverted Leek Seal Script 10. Revolving Constellation Seal Script 11. Lingzhi Seal Script 12. Biluo Seal Script</p>
<p>13. Hanging Dew Seal Script 14. Dragon Script Seal Script 15. Hanging Cloud Seal Script 16. Tadpole Script</p>
<p>17. Bird Track Seal Script 18. Insect Carving Seal Script 19. Qilin Script Seal Script 20. Swan Head Seal Script</p>
<p>21. Bird Script Seal Script 22. Luan Phoenix Seal Script 23. Dou Script Seal Script 24. Dragon Claw Seal Script</p>
<p>25. Scissors Seal Script 26. Tassel Dropping Seal Script 27. Suspended Needle Seal Script 28. Shu Script</p>
<p>29. Gold Inlay Seal Script 30. Talisman Carving Seal Script 31. Flying White Script 32. Zhongding Seal Script</p>
<p>The entire ode was translated into French by the Jesuit priest Amiot in 1770 and published in Paris. It is mentioned in the Moukden entry of the Encyclopedia Britannica. I also had the opportunity to browse through the French translation at the library. The library has many books and illustrations related to the history of northeastern China, as well as various Chinese steles and rubbings from past dynasties. The Japanese are not only involved in politics, economy, military affairs, and industry in Manchuria and Mongolia.</p>
<p>(7) The Wealth of Chinese Maps and Provincial and County Gazetteers</p>
<p>I still remember last winter when Mr. Liang from the Academia Sinica was dispatched to Rehe (Jehol) for archaeological research. When he passed through Fengtian, he wanted to find a detailed map of Rehe but could not. On November 7th of the same year, I received a letter from Mr. Matsuzaki Tsuruo, the head of the Chinese section of the Dalian Library, inviting me to visit the Chinese map exhibition held by the library and enclosing a catalog. The collection includes 451 types of detailed maps of all provinces and counties in China, even remote areas, some dating back two or three hundred years. I had already previewed these maps at the Dalian Library earlier. I also heard that the library has complete and unparalleled provincial and county gazetteers of all provinces in China, as well as many other ancient and rare books. When I visited the library in Dalian in the past, the librarian, Mr. Kakinuma Kai, showed me a catalog of the library's collection, about six inches thick. He kindly gifted me the first and second volumes of the printed catalog. The retail price for each volume is about two Japanese yen. I heard that there is also a non-public catalog.</p>

<h3>Gold Market Continues to Show Weakness</h3>
<p>Another drop of about two taels, standard gold weakened and then leveled off, the trend is downward again, but the movement is uncertain, a total of eight taels changed hands throughout the day. Afterwards, it continued to decline by about two taels. It seemed that the overseas silver market suddenly rebounded, and the psychology of the industry was weak, so it opened lower. As for the foreign exchange situation, it was loose, with buy orders coming in contrarily. However, the supply seemed constant, so the price hovered around 770 taels. The market became slightly more moderate later, staying above 70 taels. It seemed that the exchange rate stabilized, and various firms resumed buying. Finally, it stood between 73 taels. Will there be no changes in British silver this morning?</p>
<p>It opened lower at the beginning of the morning. The opening price for October was down 3.40 taels to 771 taels. Large bars rebounded by 1/16.

Subsequently, Tong Taichang, Fuyu, Fuxingyong, Fuchang, and others followed suit and sold, immediately dropping to 67 taels. Due to Zhifengyong, Dadecheng, the Dalian gang, and others buying in, and Mitsui absorbing October British gold at 875 and December at 9375, the quoted price for British gold was 69.5 taels, but the spread was 125. US dollars were 25, and Japanese gold was slightly lower by 1.5 fen, slightly less than 1 tael, at 68.2 taels.

At 9:30, it was 71.8 taels. In an instant, Yu Da, Fuxingyong, Yongfeng, and commodities hedgers sold in succession, so the price could not stand firm and fell by more than 3 taels again.

Then it fell by four or five cents. Then, Dadecheng, Zhifengyong, Yuancheng Yong, Yifengyong, Tongtaichang, and others came to drag it up, and banks seemed to be hedging British gold with each other in this month's US$30.0625. Then Shanghai and others sold November at 875, so the price rose happily, adding up to 4 taels, reaching 75 taels at 3 o'clock. HSBC sold October at 8125, followed by Mitsui selling at 875. There seemed to be more buyers, but it was sold by hedgers. At 3:30 it was 73 taels, plus another tael, but there was no excessive fluctuation. After 4 o'clock it was two, three or four cents, then 73 taels were seen again. By the time the market closed at 4:30, it was 72.6 taels, and then it was traded again around 73 taels, down 1.8 taels compared to the previous day's posted price.

<p>The yarn market has turned firmer, trending slightly higher. Overseas cotton and yarn conditions are rising consistently, and the rise in Toyo's three grades of yarn is exceptionally strong. As a result, the market sentiment is excited, and buying interest is tighter. However, the large firms' open positions have not yet been offset, so the market sentiment is still stable. Most small merchants are mentally exhausted, as they are disappointed in the autumn sales due to the severe floods in all directions. However, there is a slight hope for a turnaround in foreign cotton.</p>
<p>Yarn Market Tends to Rise. At the opening of the yarn market in the morning, American cotton rose, and market sentiment improved slightly, with slight increases of four, five, and nine cents for various months. In the afternoon, the three grades of yarn rose sharply, and the market became even tighter. A portion of the shorts in this month turned around, rising by 1.5 taels alone. Distant months rose by six, seven, and eight cents. A total of 30,100 bales were traded. It was found that Gongtai sold 1,000 bales, Dafu 700 bales, and Yichang 1,450 bales. Hengde bought 1,200 bales, Xincheng 2,200 bales, Guangfeng 950 bales, and Tianlong 600 bales. The closing prices are recorded on the left.</p>

Sales of current yarn are ordinary. It was found that a total of 1,300 bales were bought by various gangs throughout the day. 235 bales were traded among peers. The market was slightly firm. Among the merchant gangs, Sichuan bought 625 bales, Tianjin 125 bales, inland 60 bales, and miscellaneous gangs 115 bales.</p>
<h3>The Cotton Market is Inclined to the Upper Reaches</h3>
<p>The cotton market is trending upward. American cotton is rising, and Japanese Dongmian is buying in. Most local cotton merchants are in a long position, and their pulling force is particularly strong when they encounter an opportunity. As for the issue of standard cotton including Indian cotton, both sides are still discussing it. There are rumors in the business community that there were floods in all directions this year, and Hankou suffered particularly heavy losses. In the future, it will inevitably be subject to squeezing, so most people are buying in to go long. However, looking back at the world cotton industry, it is still in surplus. All factories' current cotton transactions show no signs of movement, so the future still depends on American cotton for ups and downs.</p>
<p>Hankou Standard Rises Six or Seven Cents. At the opening of the Hankou standard cotton market in the morning, both American and Indian cotton rose, and there were fewer merchants in the market. Prices for various months rose by 3 cents. In the afternoon, Japanese merchants bought in, and the market became even tighter. Prices for various months rose by 2.5 to 3 cents. A total of 78,400 dan were traded. It was found that Dachang sold 2,100 dan, Shenda 2,700 dan, Yichang 2,900 dan, Xinheng 1,600 dan, and Shenchang 1,500 dan. Guangfeng bought 4,100 dan, Changfeng 4,200 dan, Deji 2,300 dan, and Yuda 200 dan each. The closing prices are recorded on the left.</p>

<p>Spot Demand is Cut Off. The current cotton business is cut off. All factories are watching from the sidelines.</p>
<h3>Foreign Cotton and Yarn Rise Consistently</h3>
<p>American Cotton Resists Shorts and Rises. Yesterday, American cotton rose due to short covering. The harvest conditions were poor, there was a lack of merchants, and it was firm. Futures rose by 14 to 18 points, and spot rose by 20 points. British cotton futures rose by 6 points, and spot rose by 3 points. Egyptian cotton spot was unchanged. Indian cotton was firm due to Gandhi's decision to attend the London conference. Pingguoer rose by 1 rupee, Omula rose by 1.25 rupees, and Bailuoxi rose by 1 rupee. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram on the 27th).</p>

The Rice Market in Hexia Rose and Fell Again</p>
<p>The storm in Nanshi stopped yesterday morning. Twenty or thirty ships of goods arrived from the interior. Sales in urban and rural stores also slackened. The situation turned loose due to the dispatch of investigators by the Social Affairs Bureau, and the market sentiment calmed down. Changxi Beigeng temporarily maintained its original price. Sales of Su Tong Ping Li and other goods were weak, and the price was short by three corners. Early and late rice arrived and sold equally. Inventories were thick, falling by five corners. Luxiang Jian goods were also scattered, and if they were removed, they would move slightly. The market showed a steady trend. There was no market for new geng and changed yin yuan due to a lack of goods.</p>
<p>Not many goods arrived at Xinzha yesterday because the weather was clear. Sales on the street were sluggish. Thick geng, medium and second grades, were all tired by seven corners, and buying interest was extremely weak. Everyone in the market was looking to go lower. Although the supply of thin rice was limited, and the outbound routes were not good, the price also fell by 1 yuan. Changed yin yuan went downstream due to the strong arrival of geng rice, affecting new geng and foreign tips. There was no price increase or decrease. Luxiang tips and Bu tips were clearly stable and secretly weak. Foreign rice arrivals gradually thinned, and merchant gangs were actively buying, with prices continuing to be soft by two or three corners.</p>
<h3>Small Compressing Newly Set at 3,000 Tons</h3>
<p>1,000 Tons of Repatriated Goods Traded...Northern Gang Handles and Loads Passenger Yuan Rice Yesterday, spot transactions of foreign rice were suspended, but futures were very active. Spot merchants asked for high prices due to low inventories, but entrants intended to suppress smaller prices and handle them again due to the fall in flour and wheat, so there were no transactions. In futures, Dafeng sold 1,000 tons of repatriated goods, which were small compreesing for September, priced at 6 taels 5 cents and 2 fen. They were originally thrown out by the Taihe Foreign Firm. New transactions of foreign rice included 3,000 tons of small compressing for November, which was also the approved reply to the telegram sent by Xiangmao the day before yesterday. After this batch was traded, market sentiment slightly softened.</p>
<h3>期麥晨跌午回</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market, after the morning opening, prices for each month fell because the National Government announced the import of fifteen million bushels of American wheat. The news inevitably shook market confidence. The current month, due to delivery considerations, saw no buying interest from factories, and prices dropped to a low of 3.72 taels. September fell to 3.94 taels, October to 4.03 taels, November to 4.07 taels, and December to 4.11 taels. January fell to 4.14 taels, a drop of three to six fen compared to the previous day. However, in the afternoon opening, there was active short covering from outside investors, and the flour market rebounded, boosting prices for forward months by three to four fen. The delivery volume for the current month is said to have reached over one hundred carts of sampled goods. If dealers do not roll over their positions, it will likely reach two hundred carts (it is reported that Xiangxin received fifty carts, Shenda over twenty carts, and Xinfeng twenty to thirty carts). As a result, the current month was two fen higher than the previous day, September was one fen higher, October remained unchanged, November was down one fen, December down two fen, and January unchanged. Spot wheat saw no transactions due to lack of interest from factories.</p>
<h3>標粉受美麥影響</h3>
<h3>後市補空稍回</h3>
<p>Yesterday’s flour market, after the morning opening, prices for each month saw drops due to the announcement that the National Government had approved the import of fifteen million bushels of American wheat for disaster relief. This news shook market confidence, as the massive American aid implied no fear of food shortages. The long positions seemed to have lost a guarantee, so selling pressure came from factories. The current month fell to a low of 2.0775 taels, September to 2.0875 taels, and October to 2.107 taels. Other months also fell, with an average drop of two to three fen. However, in the afternoon opening, the market initially remained weak, but rapid short covering and a slight increase in spot sales helped stabilize the market. But generally speaking, this large drop followed by a small recovery is not a good sign. As a result, the current month was up by five li, September and October were up by one fen, November was up by 1.25 li, December by one fen, and January by 1.5 fen.</p>
<p>Sugar Market: Quiet Trading, Flat Prices</p>
<p>Granulated White Sugar Shows Slight Firming</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw reports from producing regions that Cuban spot sugar was priced at 1.4375, New York sugar futures for September and December were both priced at 1.31, and May and September of next year were priced at 1.35 and 1.41 respectively, a drop of three to seven fen compared to previous reports. Java spot and futures sugar prices remained unchanged. The public market saw little trading, but market sentiment was relatively stable. Dutch No. 24 coarse granulated white new sugar was traded at a price increase of 11.65 taels, with the market appearing firm. No. 20 medium granulated white sugar was priced at 11 taels, with few interested buyers. Tai Koo sugar transactions were also sluggish. B mark was 12.025 taels, DY mark was 11.825 taels, HX mark was 11.75 taels, HM mark was 11.4 taels, and O mark was 9.4 taels, trending flat. Huaxin CW mark was 11.9 taels, with little interest. Some old oil-bag coarse granulated white sugar was sold for 11.45 taels for a few hundred bags. Dealers showed little interest, and the market appeared listless.</p>
<p>North-South Goods: Large Quantities of New Black Melon Seeds Arrive</p>
<p>Market Strengthens Instead</p>
<p>A small quantity of new black melon seeds had arrived in previous batches, with Jiangxi seeds priced at 16 taels and Tianjin seeds at 17 taels. It is now reported that wholesale grocers have received a large quantity of new Xu Kui seeds, 1,200 bags in total. Because asking prices were too high, no deals have been made, and both parties are currently holding out. However, there are also 2,000 bags of Tianjin seeds that may arrive, making it difficult for prices to fall. Due to the floods this year, most producing areas are reporting reduced harvests, and people are optimistic, so sellers will definitely be firm, which can be stated with certainty.</p>
<p>Silk &amp; Tea: Japanese Merchants Continue to Purchase Shanghai Silk</p>
<p>Yesterday's silk market in Shanghai remained unchanged. European and American markets offered lower prices for Japanese silk, with a difference of over 200 taels compared to Shanghai white silk. There were no changes in silk telegraph rates. Only Japanese firms continued to cover short positions, with Mitsui and others buying 40 bales of Shanghai white silk, and Dachang and others buying 20 bales of dried white silk, with prices remaining firm.</p>
<h3>無錫白絲頭運滬不弱</h3>
<p>180 Pieces of Wuxi White Silk Waste Shipped to Shanghai, Market is Strong</p>
<p>Of the 48 silk factories in Wuxi, 40 are currently operating. The output of silk waste has increased. As the end of the month approaches, factories need to deliver silk waste to foreign firms. Yesterday, 180 pieces of long-fibered cocoon silk, boiled cocoon silk, and other types of silk waste from Wuxi silk factories arrived in Shanghai by passenger train, in preparation for delivery.</p>
<h3>婺源珍眉歐銷轉暢</h3>
<p>Wuyuan Zhenmei Green Tea Sales to Europe Improve</p>
<p>Yesterday, the tea market in Shanghai saw improved sales of Wuyuan high-grade Zhenmei green tea by foreign firms such as Xiechang, Yongxing, Baochang, and Dutoit. Tunxi Zhenmei tea was also slightly favored by the Jinlong Foreign Firm, with a firm price of 150-160 taels. Other varieties such as Gongxi Needle-eyebrow and Xiu-eyebrow teas were also actively traded. The green tea market has stabilized. Qimen black tea was favored by firms such as Jardine Matheson and Tienshsiang, but the selling price fell to 40-50 taels, causing significant losses for Chinese tea merchants.</p>
<p>Piece Goods Market Remains Sluggish</p>
<p>The piece goods market has weakened again, showing no sign of recovery. This is mainly due to the severe floods in various ports, causing widespread damage, which has completely halted sales to customers. In addition, the anti-Japanese sentiment remains high, making Japanese goods extremely sluggish. As a result, the cotton cloth public market has seen unprecedentedly low trading volume in recent days. Yesterday, medium and fine cotton cloth fell again, with Blue Double Fish at 7.4 taels, Yang Crane Colorful Ball at 7.35 taels, and Balloon at 7.7 taels. However, fine twill remained firm, as dyeing mills in Sichuan had strong demand. Coarse cloth continued to fall by 2.5 to 5 fen, and coarse twill was sluggish. Japanese goods have seen only sporadic sales recently, with small quantities being shipped to places such as Sichuan, Henan, Yunnan, and Guizhou by postal parcel. Among these, Snowflake Serge was more popular, with Hanshan Temple at 3.2 taels, Qianliju at 3.15 taels, and Filial Piety at 3.175 taels. Snowflake-colored Ting was also being shipped, with the Great Wall Horse-Riding Official Promotion design at a uniform price of 2.95 taels. Yuehua Velvet, Zhigong Ni, and Zhigong Satin have been declining sharply in recent days due to sluggish demand, down by about five li compared to last week. Sales of both arriving and stored Western goods have been quiet. The plain foreign yarn stored in Shanghai was largely damaged by the recent floods.</p>
<p>Metal Goods: More Declines Than Gains</p>
<p>Recent metal goods trading has been exceptionally quiet due to limited procurement from various regions, resulting in more declines than gains in market prices. Given the current frequent floods and sluggish cargo, it is difficult to expect a prosperous metal market. According to insiders, significant market improvement is unlikely until after the Mid-Autumn Festival.</p>
<p>Encouraging Items: New Lead Wire: After the boycott of Japanese goods, Western goods prices have increased significantly, estimated at 13.5 taels per picul (No. 16 to No. 20), while No. 21 to No. 25 sold for 19 taels. Yesterday, due to lack of inventory, 18-gauge black iron sheet also rose to 11.5 taels. 7.5 li British steel plate has risen to 6.5 taels, another increase of one qian. Garden lead wire is in short supply, and the price has risen to 5.25 taels. White lead sheet, red copper, and spot tin have seen active trading, but prices remain stable without significant gains.</p>
<p>Falling Items: Tinplate: There is little trading, and there is no hope of price recovery. It is fortunate that the market can hold steady. French West nails are currently estimated at 8.75 taels, but there are no buyers. American white iron sheet is becoming oversupplied and weakening, currently estimated at 18.75 taels. Except for the Fujian merchants, no other merchants are showing interest, so prices may continue to decline. White lead sheet is also softening due to a lack of sales orders. After the influx of domestic lead, the market for green lead is even more sluggish, estimated at 15.75 taels, with very few buyers. Other items such as new foreign coins, bamboo-joint steel, and new iron wire are all showing signs of weakness.</p>

<h3>In Memory of My Late Friend, Mr. Chen Xing Shu, and an Introduction to His Thoughts (Continued)</h3>
<p>— (He Ting, sent from Paris)</p>
<p>Whether collectivism is the truth is another question, which we cannot discuss here. However, the motivation behind this utterly selfless theory is already worthy of our admiration. We can see his selfless spirit even more clearly from his attitude towards friends.</p>
<p>Xing Shu was a kind and lovable friend. His friendship was very deep and sincere. However, he never let personal feelings interfere with public justice. Many people in society make friends for the purpose of mutual flattery and forming alliances for jobs. Xing Shu hated this the most. He believed that one should not work solely for oneself or one's friends. In a China riddled with sores and filled with the cries of suffering people, one sees compatriots in hunger, cold, poverty, and sickness everywhere. How many talents, how many patriots, how many people capable of hard work are buried within? Why and how can we always be fortunate people? If we open our eyes wide and look at society, how can we bear to hope only for the happiness of ourselves and our friends? China's problem is that everyone helps their friends but does not find ways to help society.</p>
<p>But the Chinese, who are accustomed to living in a feudal society, only know private relationships and do not know public justice. The so-called "heroes," "good men," "patriots," and "knights" in society are all figures who use public office for private gain, take bribes to help friends, and cultivate cliques. Who knows that there is a society beyond private relationships? Society and public justice seem too abstract to them. Who can understand this? No wonder, the more friends there are, the more brothers there are, the more developed private friendships are, the worse social undertakings become day by day. "Friends" and "comrades" will become synonyms for partners in robbery. In today's society, who would be willing to consider Xing Shu's idea of not harming the public for private gain?</p>
<p>One day, on a Sunday, many friends were together chatting and relaxing. Politics came up, and everyone complained and sighed as usual. Because students studying abroad have the most complaints, and the reasons for their complaints are also the most complicated. Xing Shu did not approve of complaining. He said, "When we observe society, we don't need to be happy or sad about the ups and downs of political tides, because political tides are only superficial waves in society and not the main source that drives social evolution. When discussing matters, we must trace the root and source. We must change our perspective and focus on the fundamental problem of society: the problem of production."</p>
<p>Here, his views are quite close to historical materialism, although he was not a believer in historical materialism. He analyzed the source of social chaos based on social production. He believed that Chinese society had lost its economic balance. The living standards in rural areas and the living standards in big cities were too different. The people in rural areas were living the economic life of Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries, while the people in big cities were enjoying the most luxurious material civilization of the 20th century. But most of the people in big cities can only consume. They are either "landlords," "compradors," or bureaucrats, all of whom do not engage in direct production and are "fed by others." They all directly or indirectly rely on the poor, cold, hungry, and uneducated small farmers, laborers, and small businessmen in rural areas and cities to maintain their lives. Under such circumstances, it is no wonder that the social economy is deteriorating day by day, and the people's livelihoods are becoming more and more painful. Without a solid economic foundation, it is difficult to have political stability in society. Therefore, if we want social stability, we must work hard to produce.</p>
<p>What a fundamental principle this is! From a sociological perspective, society loses "balance" and becomes unable to survive. Chinese society, from all aspects, has lost its balance and is in a state of "conflict" and "contradiction." In the economic aspect, there is an imbalance between the rural economy and the urban economy, an imbalance between consumption and production, and an uneven distribution between direct producers and indirect producers. In terms of morality and thought, there are conflicts between new and old cultures and between Eastern and Western cultures. Not to mention society, even an individual's thoughts and behaviors - of course, partly a reflection of society - are all in conflict, contradiction, and disorder. Therefore, political disorder has its main causes. What is the use of our sighing and lamenting? Xing Shu can be said to understand the source of China's social ills.</p>
<p>Now we must talk about his professional views. He was one of the best among the students studying abroad. He naturally wanted to be a scholar and professor, and a famous one. But he often said to people that he did not want to be a professor or scholar, because this was not the most urgent career needed in today's society. He really wanted to run a small business. Friends often laughed at his fantasies when they heard this, but this was indeed his very serious idea. Because he lived in the foothills, he had thought of many ways to cultivate the mountains and drafted many plans to promote the planting of fruit trees. If we think of his words as an Eastern-style hermit idea, we would be wrong. Xing Shu was an active person, at least in his thinking, because he had not yet acted. He was not a pessimist, nor was he seeking personal comfort and elegance. He saw the needs of society and advocated production, so he himself was willing to be a pioneer and carry out production activities. If big businesses fail, then work hard at small jobs.</p>
<p>The millennia-old concept of valuing scholars ("those who labor with their minds govern others, those who labor with their strength are governed by others") has made the Chinese see the terms "reading," "scholar," "learning," and "culture" as too mysterious. Who knows that culture and learning are just tools to increase the happiness of life, and have no value in themselves? From Xing Shu's professional views, we can know that his thoughts had completely shed the stench of "scholar-officials." If Xing Shu had not died young, whether his ideas could have been realized would certainly have been a major question. But the fact that he could advocate this way already meant that he was not a scholar who simply echoed others.</p>
<p>If the Chinese nation does not perish from this, in the near future, there will certainly be many patriots and young people who abandon their books, leave their purely theoretical laboratories, and race towards the path of production. The trend of social evolution is already forcing us to run that way. Xing Shu's theory is indeed a practical theory and a product of the needs of today's society.</p>
<p>I have introduced Xing Shu's main thoughts to everyone. I have not embellished them. I am not here to praise a dead friend. This is just a partial record of many late-night talks between me and Xing Shu in the six months since he returned to France from Germany. It's just a pity that my pen is too clumsy, my heart is too coarse, and my temperament is different from Xing Shu's. There are no major discrepancies between my descriptions and the gist of what he said, but there must be many differences in tone and wording. This is something I myself feel very dissatisfied with. However, there is no other way. Strictly speaking, one person cannot represent another person's thoughts.</p>
<p>There are really too many things about Xing Shu that are worth remembering. Everything about him is worth remembering. However, I have to stop writing for now. If I keep talking, I will never finish, and it will always be too tragic.</p>
<p>Neither nature nor society has ever been rationalized. In the natural world, how many beautiful flowers are destroyed by storms when they are in full bloom? In society, how many intelligent and hardworking people are permanently buried because they lack a suitable environment for cultivation? Nature gave Xing Shu innate intelligence and a favorable environment, but then took away his physical health. This is truly the unkindness of heaven and earth. I do not lament for Xing Shu; what difference is there between life and death? I only lament for society.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Mr. Chen Xing Shu was one of the founders of Guanghua University and once held a teaching position at Guanghua University. In 1927, he went to France to study political economy at the University of Paris. He was expected to obtain his doctorate this summer, but unexpectedly, he suffered from peritonitis and died in Paris on May 3rd. Now, Mr. Chen's friends, such as He Bingsong and Pan Gongzhan, have scheduled a memorial meeting to be held on the 30th of this month at the South China Science Society on Albert Road, Rue Sieyeshams, in the French Concession.</p>
<h3>The Lindbergh Family's Background and Early Life</h3>
<p>— Yuan Baokang</p>
<p>One</p>
<p>I was born on February 4, 1902, in Detroit, Michigan, USA. At that time, my father was practicing law at Littelfos in Minneapolis. Less than two months after my birth, my father took me to a farm on the banks of the Mississippi River, which was only two miles away from Littelfos.</p>
<p>My father's name was Charles Lindbergh (Note: In the United States, it is very common for fathers and sons to have the same name. You only need to add a "(Senior)" or "(Junior)" after the name.) He was born on January 20, 1860, in Stockholm, Sweden. My grandfather was Mårten Olsson (Note: After immigrating to the United States, he changed his last name to Lindbergh). He served as a member of parliament and secretary to the emperor in Sweden.</p>
<p>In 1860, my grandfather led his family and took a ship from Sweden to the United States. Soon after, he built a house in Sauk Centre, which is next to Minneapolis. My father spent his childhood there.</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>At that time, there were few schools established in Minnesota. Therefore, my father spent most of his childhood hunting and fishing. As for education, he mostly received it at home. Occasionally, he was able to attend a village school, but he never finished a semester.</p>
<p>When he formally received education, he was still studying at the Grof Lake High School in Minneapolis. After graduating, he was admitted to the University of Michigan, where he also obtained a Bachelor of Laws degree. After graduating from university, he immediately returned to Littelfos to practice law. However, he soon turned his attention to politics. In 1906, in the 10th Congress, my father was elected as the representative of the 6th district of Minnesota and sent to Washington to attend the meeting. He held this position for a total of ten years.</p>
<p>My mother was English and was born in Detroit. She also graduated from the University of Michigan with a Bachelor of Science degree. Later, she obtained a Master's degree from Columbia University. My maternal grandfather was Charles Land, a dentist in Detroit. He was born in New Cross, Canada. My maternal great-grandfather was John Land, who immigrated to Canada from England and was one of the founders of Hamilton City.</p>
<p>My maternal grandfather devoted himself to dental research and worked tirelessly in the laboratory all day long. He made great contributions to dentistry, such as the inlay of gold teeth. He was also the first to invent and use porcelain teeth. Therefore, many people called him the ancestor of porcelain teeth. Presumably, this honor was hard-earned.</p>
<p>Before I was four years old, I lived in Minneapolis. Apart from going to Detroit, I had not traveled far to other places. After my father was elected, our family had two addresses. We spent the winters in Washington and returned to Minnesota in the summers. Detroit also became a place that we often passed through.</p>
<p>At the age of eight, I entered Force School in Washington. Because our movements were uncertain, it affected my studies. As a result, I never finished a full school year.</p>
<p>During this period, I made long journeys, crossing the United States twice and going to Panama once. But these interesting long journeys never satisfied my desires, because I am a very good traveler.</p>
<p>Among the subjects in school, my favorite was mechanics. After graduating from Littelfos High School, I decided to study mechanics. Two years later, I transferred to the Mechanical Engineering College of the University of Wisconsin in Madison.</p>
<p>After that, I turned my attention to aviation. The first time I saw an airplane was in Washington in 1912. Since then, my heart has been bewitched by it. In 1922, I entered an aviation school. Although I was surrounded by airplanes every day, it never satisfied me, because I felt that I had too little contact with airplanes.</p>
<p>Four</p>
<p>The busyness of university studies caused me to often suffer from headaches. I had no choice but to read outdoors to avoid the pain.</p>
<p>During my first summer vacation, I went to the artillery school in Kentucky. After staying for about two weeks, I scraped together $40 and set off on a motorcycle for Florida. When I arrived at Jacksonville, I didn't overspend. On the same day, I took the same motorcycle and sought another way back. Seventeen days later, I returned to Madison, with the motorcycle damaged and only nine dollars left in my pocket. I rested in Madison for a while, and the motorcycle was heavily repaired. When it was finished, I took the road back to Littelfos to spend the remaining vacation.</p>
<p>In the third semester, I decided to study aviation and decided that this should be the direction of my student life. Therefore, before the end of the semester, around mid-March (1922), I resolutely left Madison and went to Lincoln, entering the Nebraska Aviation Training School. At this point, my long-cherished wish can be said to have been achieved. When I left school, many people clicked their tongues and said that I was young and reckless, abandoning the right path and turning to evil. But thinking about it now, my success today is entirely based on that decisive action at that time.</p>
<p>Translator's Note: Mr. and Mrs. Lindbergh are currently making a flight to the Far East and are about to arrive in Tokyo. The political circles in our country are also preparing a welcome meeting. Deputy Commander Zhang is now willing to provide his personal Ford plane for them to tour China. Therefore, before they arrive in the country, I am introducing their history here.</p>

<h3>A Woman's Confession</h3>
<p>— Xu Gengsheng</p>
<p>A Woman's Confession Xu Gengsheng</p>
<p>Zhou Leshan has achieved astonishing success in using fresh and lively brushstrokes, outlining concisely, swiftly, and yet with rich and delicate colors, to depict the lives, thoughts, and actions of modern urban women, which forms the foundation of most of his creations.</p>
<p>(A Woman's Confession) includes a total of fifteen short stories and one novella, namely A Woman's Confession. This piece can be considered the representative work of this collection because it best reflects the author's style (that concise and deeply moving style). From the preface by Mr. Chuan Yanzhang.</p>
<p>The so-called A Woman's Confession depicts a woman's confession before her death. This woman had been married to seven husbands, had wandered through famous cities such as Dalian, Nanyang, Kuala Lumpur, Paris, and Shanghai. She had been a child bride (adopted daughter-in-law), and then became a modern girl, a dancer, a singer, the wife of an official, a famous actor, a school principal, a wealthy merchant, and a lawyer, and finally became a prostitute and the owner of a brothel. Despite such complex plots, characters, vast regions, and disparate customs, the author has managed to include her within twenty-eight Chinese pages, making us feel that every plot is vividly portrayed, all the characters are distinct, and every region is like a personal experience. This cannot but be recognized as the author's mental agility.</p>
<p>The female protagonist, Wei, is a bold and willful woman, courageous in love and contention, but easily subdued, intoxicated, and captivated by love, a woman of strong character. Let us look at the words of our author when her second husband, Y, falls in love with her classmate, Miss B, and (takes Miss B under his arm and sends her out the door), describing her state of mind in contending for love:</p>
<p>(At that time, I wanted to commit suicide, and I also wanted to take revenge. Suicide, revenge, I thought about it all night, and finally decided that suicide is the act of the weak. I decided to take revenge.</p>
<p>After embracing the doctrine of revenge, my actions were completely different from before. My social activities outside were all kept secret from Y. At that time, I expected Y to be particularly good to me, and Y gradually began to love me wholeheartedly again. One night, he voluntarily confessed to me his previous sins. He said that he didn't know why his conscience was temporarily blinded and he was seduced by B.</p>
<p>He wanted me to forgive him. I pretended not to care about it and said with a smile,</p>
<p>"Does this count as anything? Young people often have this."</p>
<p>I then proceeded with my revenge plan.</p>
<p>I started to attack Chen Butong, a good friend of Y's…)</p>
<p>Let's look again at the place where she is depicted as bold and willful. This is a scene of her divorce from her third husband, Chen Butong:</p>
<p>(Why did you engage in singing opera without my consent?</p>
<p>I coldly replied to him,</p>
<p>Can you control me? Is acting in a play an illegitimate business?</p>
<p>I will not allow you to go on stage today no matter what.</p>
<p>I insist on going on stage, what can you do?</p>
<p>His face turned green and he shouted loudly,</p>
<p>If you don't listen to me, then we will sever our relationship from now on.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Who's joking with you? I don't want a woman like you who doesn't listen to restrictions.</p>
<p>Then that's for the best. Meet me at Lawyer Lu's office after my performance.)</p>
<p>Let's take another look at how he writes about her being subdued, intoxicated, and captivated by love. This is her cohabitation with Ying Baiyi in Dalian:</p>
<p>(At that time, I had found true love in the world. I began to believe that the saying "love is unconditional" could be established.)</p>
<p>At that time, what did I hope for? I only hoped that my and Baiyi's happy life would continue forever, to infinity.)</p>
<p>As for the personalities of the several male characters in the story, they are also clearly different. Wei's older brother is a deep and decisive person. Y is a young man whose love easily drifts. Chen Butong is a copper-smelling merchant, in whose eyes everything is commodified, and women are also commodified. Wu Baiyi is a strong male, and at the same time loyal to the physical fascination of women. Yao Yicheng is a generous merchant, and therefore also a cowardly husband. Huang Fang is a feminine man, a fatalist without decision. Chen Yi'ou is an insidious person. Xia Weiyin is a dashing artist. Mr. C is a silent lawyer with a scientific mind. Although the temperaments of the above-mentioned people are all different, the author did not deliberately portray them from the front. He only hinted from the side, subtly, unintentionally, and set them off from all aspects. Apart from the depiction of Mr. C's character, this is also an expression of the author's rich artistic cultivation.</p>
<p>In addition, I want to talk about his skill in writing scenery. I will bring up his writing about Paris here. Paris is a famous city with a high degree of material life in the world, but if you first focus on the material, then no matter how you write (gold-obsessed and paper-drunk,) you cannot show the characteristics of Paris, you cannot show the lively and fresh Paris. The author seems to have seen this, so he specially extracts the suburbs of Paris to write, extracts the autumn of Paris to write, and from the autumn, he extracts the red leaves to write. Thus, the red leaves of autumn in the suburbs of Paris are written so concretely, so vividly, so humorously, and so full of poetic interest. Now let's quote her below:</p>
<p>(When I arrived in Paris, it was just autumn. The autumn in Paris is more beautiful than anything else. If you look out to the suburbs of Paris, the mountains and fields are covered with red leaves, red enough to be loved. At that time, the suburbs were more lively than the city. Fashionable women often took their lovers in light cars and went for a stroll nearby. That kind of fashionable dress can be said to be different for everyone, making people secretly exclaim "Good!"</p>
<p>In addition, the red leaves are really intoxicatingly red. Many people sit under the mountain peaks full of red leaves drinking, and their faces are as red as the red leaves. I love Paris, the intoxicating Paris!)</p>
<p>The above is my impression after reading A Woman's Confession.</p>
<p>As for the other articles, except for (Urban Fantasia), which is a different kind of symbolic style, unseen in the author's works, they all have one thing in common, that is, they can contain a deep sadness in the plain narration, that is, the sentence-making and wording have no traces of chiseling. The author is a prolific writer. In the past two years, four collections of creations and eight children's literature works have been published. It is true as the author himself said, (If I stay in Shanghai again, I am afraid that I will write a lot of books,) but the unique color in his works is unintentional, unpretentious, and full of the unrestrained beauty like idle clouds and wild cranes, which can be found everywhere. In short, these works are not novels made up, but novels written out. This may be one of his characteristics.</p>

<h3>Marshal Foch's European War Diary</h3>
<p>— Translated by Gu Angruo</p>
<p>The battle to clear the remnants of the enemy north of the 疴亚斯 River has now been completely successful. Before concentrating our forces to advance on Cambrai and Mezières, we must first conduct the battle of the Meuse River according to the planned plan, with a large American force as a reserve. I then replied to Admiral Haig,</p>
<p>...The final objective you mentioned in your letter coincides with my plan for the Allied forces to fight. These battles are being conducted separately in several different areas. The time between each battle is very short. Now we only need to actively develop these battles. I am focusing on achieving this goal.</p>
<p>The allocation of all forces now must depend on the outcome of future battles. It is also the same whether American troops still need to be transferred to the British side. We can only push forward with all our strength for the time being.</p>
<p>On August 26, Commander Horne directed the British right wing to attack east of Arras, winning a great victory in one battle. The next day, he seized the ferry crossing of the Saint-Cyr River under Clercy. On the 28th, he captured Clercy and attacked the Telequancian line. This is the enemy's base. The enemy defended by danger, and it was difficult for our army to advance again. On the 29th, the enemy took advantage of its position to counterattack the British First Army. Although unsuccessful, the enemy seized the opportunity to retreat further south.</p>
<p>The German army, seeing Commander Horne's rapid advance and the threat of the British Third and Fourth Armies and the French First Army, was greatly frightened. It immediately carried out a retreat along the vast line between the Saint-Cyr River and the 疴亚斯 River on August 27, 28, and 29, deploying defenses on the Cham River and the North Canal. Key towns such as Combles, Herschnault, La Vacquerie, and Noyon in the middle road were abandoned. On the west bank of the Cham River, the enemy is now defending only a bridgehead in front of Péronne. Our army must defeat the enemy here with a main force attack.</p>
<p>On August 30, the British Fourth Army seized the railway bridge south of the city. On the night of August 31 and September 1, it occupied the key of the city of Péronne's defense, the Little Mountain of Saint-Quentin. At dawn the next day, the German army in the ancient city of Péronne surrendered.</p>
<p>The British First Army continued to advance on the extreme left wing of the battle line, preparing to attack the Telequancian line. The British-French central army (British Third, Fourth Armies, French First, Third Armies) was attacking the Cham River line. The French Tenth Army was on the right wing of the battle line, fighting fiercely on the plateau north of Soissons between the Aisne River and the Ailette River. The enemy defended by danger and trenches. Mount Saint-Pépin was the pillar of the German defense for four years and would not be easily abandoned. However, the French Tenth Army advanced inch by inch, progressing daily, and finally captured the heights of Celles-sur-Aisne on September 2 and reached the highway from Soissons to the Celles-sur-Aisne villa area.</p>
<p>At the other end of the battle line, the British First Army re-attacked. After fierce fighting on September 2, it broke through the Telequancian line and advanced several miles towards Marquion. The enemy suffered a heavy blow and retreated along the entire line between the Cham River and the Saint-Cyr River, deploying a new defense line before the Hindenburg Line, relying on the Tortille River and the North Canal.</p>
<p>In this way, after the failure of the German offensive on July 15, the Allied forces quickly took the opportunity to counterattack and won a great victory. The goals in the plan of July 24 have now been fully achieved. On July 18, the reserve group army (Sixth, Tenth Armies) attacked between the Aisne River and the Marne River. Soon, the central group army (Ninth, Fifth Armies) continued to advance between the Marne River and the Vesle River. Within three weeks, the enemy was driven back to the Vesle River, and the Paris-Châlons-sur-Marne railway line was cleared.</p>
<p>On August 8, the French and British armies attacked between the Ancre River and the Avre River. Within three days, the enemy retreated to the old defense line of 1914, and the Amiens and Paris-Amiens railway lines were completely out of danger.</p>
<p>After these goals were achieved, the British First, Third, Fourth Armies and the French First, Third, Thirteenth Armies simultaneously attacked the entire line between Arras and Soissons. After two weeks of fierce fighting, the enemy was greatly shaken and retreated to the Hindenburg Line. (To be continued)</p>
