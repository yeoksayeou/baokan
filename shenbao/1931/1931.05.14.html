<p>西班牙之反敎運動。形勢愈趨嚴重。搗毁敎堂寺院傷斃敎民之事。各地仍在繼續發現。而羅馬敎皇亦已訓令其使臨向西班牙提出抗議。此事之原因。有可得而言者。當西班牙共和政府成立之初。司法部即宣佈廢棄天主敎爲國敎。其照會敎皇使者之文。謂新政府此後對各敎將一視同仁。當時敎廷。雖未有不滿之表示。然該敎徒在西班牙境内。驟失其獨尊之地位。當然不能不有所怨恨。而新政府之所以首先意於此。則以天主敎徒向爲君主黨中之中堅分子。恐此後助反對派活動。故以此先發制之。記者曾論此事。認爲新政府大可憂慮之一。而不謂今日果已突然爆發矣。人民對於該敎徒積怨旣深。該敎徒又以失去勢力急謀恢復之活動。於是相逼而成此暴舉。據今日路透電謂。伐倫西亞某寺院。搜出軍械子彈及文件。證明院中敎徒。陰謀反抗共和政府。以圖帝制死灰之復燃。故知此次西班牙人民之反。敎不單純反敎。而實有政治問題雜於其中。一時不易收拾。此又不待煩言者也</p>

<p>（南京）　但是也是不相上下、這些都是據城市村鎭容易看見的記下來的、空鄉僻壞中的人命財產、更不知道有多少了、我們試想如果這種禍害蔓处起來、那末、每年全國人命財產的損失、是如何可怕的數目、所以我們現在决不可再以毛賊視之、如果我們自身不努力的話、也就説不定唐代黃巢明末流寇之禍、又將現於今日了、本來歷代的流寇、都有他憑藉的優勢、赤匪則除了這些優勢以外、還有其他的鬼蜮、第一流寇不惜犧牲民衆、而政府軍隊總要顧到地方安寗、因爲赤匪採取這不惜犧牲的惡計、所以民衆不能不畏而從賊、因爲政府軍隊不能亂殺、所以民衆也就不會怕他、從前曾國藩勦髮匪的時候、也説過「必使之畏我同於畏賊、」這就是看破了匪的伎倆的憤語了、所以赤匪可以焚燒房屋、逼上山上、可以不帶糧秣隨地就食、可以逼着民衆當赤衛隊擋前鋒、而我們當然都不能做的、第二、流寇總是利用險阻的地勢、裏脅土著、所以地形在我們總是不熟悉、在他們則可隨時擾竄、第三就是愚弄農人、這也是歷代流寇所常常利用到的一個狠狡的方法、他們鼓動佃農來分田、而實際上租谷都抽到匪的手中去、這是根據事實、毫無虚造、他們利用雇農來分田、而實際上則如同漁翁玩鷺　一様、并不許他吃進去、所以匪用種種欺騙方法來煽動鄉民、而結果則完全是要拿他們擋頭陣、第四就是愚弄兵士、他們欺騙兵士、説有十元一月、而實際上三元還不到、而且待遇之苛、防備之利害、更非人所能忍受、第五則是發展人們獸慾、驤他們打破家庭、然後好專門爲匪所利用、所以女子小孩也就被匪利用爲宣傳的工具、總括説起來、赤匪的策略、就上兇狼狡詐的四個字、殺人放火是凶、犧牲羣衆是狠、避强打弱是狡、欺騙農工是詐、總之、赤匪是爲目的不擇手段的、只要能奪政權、甚麽事也可做出、關於較詳的分析、本席另外有一本小册子分送、請各位參閲、國民政府對於勦匪、從前因爲注全力於削平軍閥、限於事實、不能從早撲滅、現在已經下决心、要把匪迅速肅清、江西目前是匪的根據地、所以政府派了二十萬大軍、從事圍勦、并且命本席赴江西主持勦匪軍事、此次勦匪、旣然具了最後的决心、所以一切過去的錯誤、皆要糾正、從前因爲把匪的力量估計過低了、所以常常受着暗算、不免有小的損失、其次則是兵站没有、運輸交通非常不方便、以致匪可以用堅壁清野的方法來困我、其三、則是我們軍餉偶然没有發清、以致匪徒可以乘機煽惑、其四、則是我們那時没有政治訓練、迷誤宣傳不能爲民衆所看破、可是現在這些錯誤都改正過來了、我們現在有了剿匪宣傳處、進勦部隊多設有兵站、勦匪部隊之軍餉、則按預算八成、實數發給毫不拖欠、所以這些情况、都要比以前進步些、目前我們要用步步爲營的策略、逐漸的把他肅清、讓他們無從施其散兵戰、然後好讓我們聚而殲之、江西方面、自從上月圍勦以來、匪勢日蹙、如廣昌銅鼓永豐樂安寗都泰和等縣、現均收復、現正進勦匪之老巢、—寗都附近各要點、鄂東方面股匪之主力、被我吉部擊潰、山東抱犢崮及湖南境内之大股赤匪、已完全肅清、如今後無其他故障、一定可以把赤匪完全消滅、我們從赤匪猖獗的原因、與乎現在的禍害看來、我們已經充分的明了、赤匪對於我們民族、我們身身的大患、一定有三點趨勢、一個就是把中國送爲赤色帝國主義者的𨽻屬國、很明顯的中國共產黨是直接受第三國際指揮、匪之所謂蘇維埃、又受匪黨的指揮、以過去事實爲證、匪黨重要領袖常以赤色帝國主義者的喜怒爲進退、然則中國的最高統治權、豈不在外人的手裏、我們知道所謂民族自决、是無論好意與惡意、都以不受外力干涉爲前提、如果照赤匪的辦法、還説什麽自决、於直連民族國家都可以不要了、另一個大患則是空前未有的死亡與犧牲、將要在中國現出來、我們都知道俄國革命時所受的損失、所死的人數、無論他現在宣傳如何進步、然即過去的犧牲、再過幾十年、還是抵不住的、在中國却完全如上古代流寇式的殺掠、那麽、比俄國的犧牲至少還要多百倍了、在這種大犧牲中、赤匪然後可以激動人們好殺的情緒、發展人們的獸慾、才可以作他們好的工具、所謂洪水猛獸之患也、就不過如是了、此外、就是這一般匪黨、將要憑藉這種預期的混亂、以覇佔政權、宰割民衆、同時匪黨以内的糾紛、也將隨之而擴大、固然以匪現在的力量、是還不能把這一種大患實現出來、但是如果我們怠忽輕敵、那就不能預算了、所以現在勦匪的一件事、不單是政府的責任、也同時是國民大家的責任、這是一個個人的問題同時也是一個民族的問題、我們要爲着民族的緣故、個人的緣故、大家担起勦匪的任務、從赤匪起因的分析上、我們就可明白、勦匪也必須針對着他的起因、除了改良敎育方針、提高農民生活、應令省政府負責外、我們國民自身要注意的有三、第一·我們就是要從振起民族精神、恢復民族自信做起、我們要用這種精神和自信、團結所有民衆來勦滅這爲外人做走狗的匪黨、我們要用這種精神和自信、來消滅一切個人意見和私人利益、第二·我們必須竭誠擁護中央和平統一、只有永久的和平統一、才能免除軍閥的割據、才能爲有組織的應戰、第三·我們必須堅固自身的自衛組織、使匪徒不能容身、自身的團結也永不爲小事所破壞、如果大家都能了知赤匪的罪惡、了知自身的責任、本着簡單的三點做去、那麽、我們相信赤匪的撲滅、就是在目前的、（十三日專電）</p>

<p>讀自由談靈花君印度遊記。常及道階法師。因憶其師八指頭陀。以見浮屠氏之多高僧焉。頭陀法名敬安。自署曰寄禪。湘人。幼失怙恃。以貧窶故。出家衡山某寺。司飼貓犬之役。一日。見籬中桃花零落。飛紅滿溪澗。恍然有悟。遂於佛前。燃去二指。不覺智慧大開。偶游岳陽樓。見洞庭烟波浩渺。不覺期吟曰。「洞庭波送一僧來。」自是文思飆發。下筆爲詩。清俊拔俗。耆碩訝爲賈島復生。樊樊山·易哭菴·陳散原諸人。與師詩歌唱和甚富。卓錫四明天童寺時。與鄕老盛省傳·陳天嬰唱和亦多。所刋八指頭陀詩集。説者謂可亂唐人楮葉云。師軀幹魁梧。聲若洪鐘。其修屠浮之學。似不及今日台宗諦閑之淵博。太虚之新頴。然頭陀爽直坦白。急公好義。不談佛學而深合佛理。觀其創辦佛敎會·僧學校。成績斐然可觀。豈得厪以「詩僧」目之哉。時項城當國。頭陀以佛敎會立案事。北走燕都。爲某科長所揶揄。憤甚。是晚圓寂於旅邸。其徒法源寺方丈道階。爲之經紀其喪。葬於四明天童之生壙。壙外遍植梅花。師詩所謂「傳心一明月。埋骨萬梅花。」者是也。茲錄師詩數首如下。包恊如舍人。以其友李商山羣。弔女弟子花月㾗詩見寄。爲題二絶句於後。「月湖湖上有人家。十五雛姬鬢始鴉。不許紅塵侵玉骨。野風吹落白蓮花。」「紫蘭香凈掩重門。省識　天小謫魂。莫向湖邊歌懊惱。鏡花水月偶留㾗。」題王梧生戶曹所藏韓人金醉堂詩卷。「欲向西山歌采薇。白雲心事與時違。誰將東海孤臣涙。吹上南朝舊衲衣。」「國破身存恨若何。遙憐荆棘泣銅駝。降王却愛魏宮妓。壯士空悲易水歌。」重陽後一日。金陵寄魏學佐太湖。「又作江南客。蕭然憶舊游。微霜洞庭葉。殘照秣陵秋。問訊重陽節。登高何處樓。白衣應送酒。曾插菊花不。」夫詩詞爲人之慧業。師以略識之無。而所造如是。佛氏六通之説。信不誣也。</p>

<p>讀晋史陸機被誅時。歎曰。華亭鶴唳。可復聞乎。是則華亭縣之產鶴。已著於古。今種類猶存。在縣之境内坡水涯間。朱冠白羽。長頸閣足。往往而見。一若高人逸士之臨流訪勝也。其形較尋常所見之鶴爲小。尾與翅無雜羽。周身潔白。最奇者。其飛不出華亭境。故他處難得一見。而其巢多構縣署前之大樹上。性頗馴。除出覓食外。每拳一足閉雙目。棲於樹頂。雖兒童號呼驅擾於其下。閉目拳足如故。或取磚上擲。不切其身。則略一開目俯視而已。其幽靜鎭定。不肯自擾有如此。誠足爲我人法也。然因是而每爲弋者所戕害。有司雖一再禁止。奈弋者自弋。令之不行可知矣。余聞歐美人不特對於古物保存之。研究之。而於禽獸種類之鮮者。亦必豢養保護。使之永久留存。我深恐華亭之鶴。不出數十年。其種且滅絶。如麒麟鳳凰之徒留美名於人間耳。</p>

<p>不佞旋因不洽于主任宋君。解職去滬。師嘗代爲扼腕。且勉之曰。處世以和。持躬宜端。無生驕慢心。務重一己人格。拜領嘉言。銘之肺腑。違師年餘。無時不在繫念中。今歲三月。重進明星。又以筆墨紛繁。不克走謁。四月朔。承瘦鵑先生示我居址。乃往叩謁。師臥病甫起。然神氣健旺。不改從前。接談兩小時之久。别後情形。詳詢靡遺。師嘗曰。今旣有室。宜勤所事。不可因循自誤。别時知不佞藝金魚成癖。囑旋里時帶幾尾來。蓋師壯年亦曾蓄此。憶有金魚養方一文。刋某報也。</p>

<p>人事叢脞。足跡不至吳門者。幾易歲序。日前公司同人赴蘇攝取「人參果」劇外景。遂偕往焉。不意天不做美。抵蘇即雨。枯坐旅邸。異常悶損。乃與杜宇君驅車進城。作滄浪亭之游。水榭曲廊。嶙嶒累石。杜宇亟賞之。蓋滄浪亭之美。美在外表。入門攬勝。反覺林泉庸凡。了無桂趣。想蘇舜卿有知。當亦首肯予言。内設美術專門學校。學友顏樑主其政。文樑游歷法邦。臨摹彼邦名油畫若干幅張諸於壁。工緻無與倫比。石膏像雕製絶精。有如無瑕白璧。蓋皆自彼邦帶來者也。壁間更張有國畫。最饒韻致者。爲顏蒓生之桃。樊少雲之林石。蔡震淵之雛鴨。爲之駐足凝目者久之。往對門可園訪吟秋。未值。即歸閶。習日。天仍霢霖不已。但限於時期。有不能待晴之勢。乃雇汽油艇。冒雨駛行。達支硎山麓。諸演員化裝結束。相率陟坡。予爲雨故。裏足未能登岸。獨臥篷窗中。看雨珠跳激。谿水盡成泡沬。前滅後起。人事之代謝。彷彿似之。且風吹山木。倍覺颼　作響。眺望遠巒。生雲冉冉。爲景絶奇。非晴霽之時所得而領略也。予口占一絶云。「黃鸝老去櫻桃熟。正是送春迎夏天。難得浮生閒半日。一篷烟雨綠谿眠。」欲再續吟。而諸演員已攝畢下艇。遂開至車站。乘長車而返。</p>

<p>二十日到青島停四小時。參觀德國舊時砲台。青島大學。及觀象台。</p>
<p>青島大學校舍。即前卑士麥兵營。去年開辦分文理兩院。文學院分中國哲學。外國哲學。敎育學三系。理學院分數學。物理學。化學。生物學四系。學生百餘人。敎徒三十人。常年費實領到的。省撥三十六萬圓。膠濟路撥四萬八千圓。共四十萬八千圓。</p>
<p>青島觀象台。建自德人手。後爲日本占領。民國十一年接收。現設氣象部。地震部。天文部。磁力部。海洋部。每日廣送天氣圖。日管時代限於日本船。且用日文。今則普及中外船舶。設有短波無線電台。收發氣象電報。凡近海船舶。遇暴風等有所咨詢。直接答覆。三年以來。用電音報時機以代午砲。一日三次。頗準確。新建圓頂。赤道儀室。購置大鏡及日月攝影器等。中華敎育文化基金董事會特助二萬五千圓添購赤道儀子午儀。以時養成測候人才。台長蔣丙然自接收時即任此。極努力。印行各種圖表年刊月刊及其他出版物多至數十種。然每月經費僅得三千圓。由市政府支出。</p>
<p>此台尙爲中日間一種懸案。當十一年接收時。日本不肯放棄東亞海上學術權。藉口我無此項專門人才。不允交還。磋商結果。規定由中國派台長練習員。但日員照舊執務。不受中國報酬。將來技術員養成後。與日本職員交代。並訂定與日本各地聯絡報告免費方法。實則中國何至並此項技術員而無之。其後日本職員自遞意見書稱中國已有此項技術員。應全部交還。但交涉至今。日方種種推諉。卒無結果。</p>

<p>— 程小青</p>
<p>霍桑所提出的疑問。果眞是很重要的。可是這内幕中的情由旣很幻複。一時也得不到相當的結論。我們三個人經過了十多分鐘的考慮。就假定有三種緣因。就是除了霍桑先前所説的盜动和惡作劇以外。又假定一種報復的理想。霍桑因説道「這個人設計非常周密。又很險毒。决不是尋常朋友中開玩笑的舉重。試想當時間我的老友包朗。如果再前進一步不是會發生性命的危險麽。」張寳全點頭道。「是啊。這事當眞險極。最可恨的。那邱奎實在太愚蠢無用了霍桑道「這探夥的舉動。如果當眞出於愚蠢。那還可原。否則我不能不疑他有通同的嫌疑了。」張寳全忙道。「這一層决不會的。我可保證。今晚上我從高家門前經過。瞧見門外面車馬擁擠。料想來客很多。所以我除了依照那高佩賢的請求。派了四個警士去照料以外。又派這邱奎去暗守護。以防萬一。却不料他鑄成了大錯。但我派遺他。在黃昏時方才决定。所以預先的串通。决不可能的。」霍桑低倒了頭。把手指彈去了些烟灰。不即答話。我因接口道。「張先生能保證他不會串通。那再好没有。但最好呌他有些表示。那才能憑信。」張寳全道。「怎様表示。請包先生吩咐。我一定呌他遵辦。」我道。「那奸徒當時旣被他放走。理應由他負責追尋回來。我以爲他在三天以内。應當把那人交給我們。至少也應查明他的踪迹。」張寳全連連點頭道。「好好。這個不但是他應負的責任。我的職分所在。也當同様負責。」這一種辦法霍桑雖不曾參加意見。但明明是贊同的。他立起身來。把那書桌上的項圈。依舊用那塊白巾包好。他説道。「寳全兄。旣然如此。我們就分頭進行罷。這東西暫時由我保管。你總可應許罷。」</p>

<p>早開低盤即入靜境　自早間六月份開盤計跌二兩九錢、爲七百四十三兩八錢、大條長十六分之一、銀價公私電均升四分之一、於是人心下游、旋後大連帮等買進、漲至四十五兩、然福餘元春恒餘等售出、遂降至四十三兩、至滙市平平、朝鮮初進大連一兩五錢九分三七五、正金進一兩五錢九分二五、英金可結一三三一二五、入後源成及物品等買進、遂又抬高三兩、至先令揭佈未更、僅東滙加二五、時爲四十五兩九錢、内盤和平、正金買現大連一兩五錢九分二五、惟檯面上賣者似多、退爲四十四兩七八錢、昌升永乾昌祥永豐等追購、十點時爲四十六兩半、此時華銀行曾做過八月英金一三二五至三一二五、未幾時乾昌祥同太昌等出售、且美日等銀行售出七月英金三一二五、故退至四十五兩一錢、轉瞬買方适動、志豐永大興永恒餘等皆進、加之三井吸大連一兩五錢九分半、即行拉上二兩、十點半後爲四十七兩、往後天裕永等出售、十一點十餘分爲四兩六七錢、大連帮及春源永等拖進、故又加起一兩餘、三井亦吸七月美金三十一元、至十一點半後爲六兩三錢、復又抑至五兩二三錢、乃散戶脱手、惟同太昌等補進、計爲四十六兩、午收四十五兩八錢、揭價改爲七百八十四兩一錢、計撳三十八九兩、</p>
<p>無聊之極提早收市　午後開盤四十五兩八</p>
<p>錢繼爲五兩半、復漲至四十六兩、但交易微細、二點半天裕永同太昌等來賣遂降八九錢至二點五十餘分爲四十五兩一錢、檯而上異常寂寞、惟市塲秩序複亂、一般同行中好動者、互將踢鞋作球類戲、一時人聲鼎沸、故三點零即行閉市、收盤爲四十五兩五錢、無如不散、重又哄上四五錢、故物品做大四錢、比較前天（照掛牌）討回落一兩二錢、迭漲多日反向也、按終四最大價四十七兩、最小價四十三兩、相差四兩、物品早市四兩二錢、午收五兩六錢、下午六兩、收市五兩九錢、揭價計抑小三十八九兩、登賬四十六兩、補水四十四兩、下午同、</p>

<p>昨日英美銀市均已報升、惟市况平靜、殆匯豐掛牌各匯除香港加一二五、計七十八兩八七五、日金加二五、計一兩六錢二分七五外、其餘均無伸縮、至於内盤英美日三匯以見鬆勢、惟無特殊變化、因金市甚平庸、然結果濳小一兩零、午刻收市比較前天、計英金長零六二五、美金亦加零六二五、日金則降二五、正謂明增暗减景况也、下午因逢週三、例無市面、而金業中稍有結進英金、銀行如匯豐花旗台灣安達等有所賣出、約成交十萬鎊之數、美金少數出入、至大連帮曾抛出大連票一百萬元、悉由日商銀行購去云、</p>
<p>英匯　内盤半日間計有零六二五升降、匯豐於早晨出七月三一二五、美豐與麥行互做本月同價、十點時興業與和豐對做七八月二五至三一二五、旋後花旗台灣出七八月三一二五、十一點後安達出二五至三一二五、午收出價與早開彷彿、</p>
<p>美匯　内盤僅以一二五上落、早開出價三</p>

<p>骤跌時間、差勝多多不過需求稀少、形勢卒難飛騰、照目下情形、確已蒸蒸日上、但終難趨出從前舊價、（即七錢三分）蓋繭汎不振、即有客路、其他銷胃、終屬不暢耳</p>
<p>厘拆價格（洋厘）早市厘價較前日午市又好三毫七忽半、爲七錢二分八厘三毫七忽半、午市續高七毫半、爲七錢二分九厘、結果較前日早市又加昻一厘有奇、（銀拆）早午兩市均爲四分劃頭則又爲白劃</p>

<p>紗花　紗市午後轉秀勢</p>
<p>紗市晨跌午漲、但現銷較爲發展、車洋出口交易又見活動、故大阪三品紗本月份軋空、近日漲風劇烈、因該處底貨枯薄、空頭恐慌、今日購去二十支人鐘紗五百包、日幣一百○八元五角、合規元百七十八九兩光景、因之商塲上人心大爲震動、市氣遂形轉漲、惟美棉形勢尙疲、於是賣出壓迫、依然劇烈以十支粗紗存貨太厚、而時期在清澹之際、逢漲抛賣者即衆、總之目前大部份看小、尙不脱盤旋之局實需較爲興奮、</p>

<p>棉市始跌後漲、美棉市氣仍疲、但本埠底貨太枯、來源凋零、漢埠來申購印棉、足見到貨缺乏、所以日商及多頭拉緊不放、故一跌即漲、惟現棉交易沈悶、散戶有做空者、</p>

<p>幸虧一躍下車才得免脱</p>
<p>昨日上午十時四十五分鐘、南市新開河麵粉交易所門口、發生綁票案、茲將其詳情、探錄於後、</p>
<p>經營麵粉　該所五十二號經紀</p>
<p>人潘家熾、字瑞階、羅店人、年四十七歲、向在新拉圾橋公益里口、開設瑞記麵粉號、專營阜豐公司之現貨麵粉、住宅則賃於法租界蒲柏路一三八號洋房、</p>
<p>一度被綁　自昔年十月間一度</p>
<p>被匪綁去贖出後、行蹤稍秘、惟亦日至交易所、乘自備黑色汽車、車之號碼、公共租界爲三三二六、華界爲二三七八、到所辦公、風雨不間、</p>
<p>二次遇險　不料昨日當麵粉市</p>
<p>塲散市後、潘即遣門房、招呼停在丹鳳街口之汽車馳來、預備登車至瑞記號視事、當時忽有一西裝少年、向該所門崗孫玉鳳、詢問粉所是否即將搬塲、門崗不以爲意、頷首稱是、且告以遷至何處、</p>
<p>綁匪三人　其時潘之汽車夫揚</p>
<p>州人施家筠、（二十四歲）已將車子開近門口、潘即招呼其子潘房康、先行上車、而已隨之、惟左面之車門未閉、車夫正欲撥動機輪、站在法租界之身穿黑色長袍者凡三人、頎頎偉貎、孔武有力、飛快奔近車、</p>
<p>肉票逃脱　三人各執手槍、先</p>
<p>將車夫嚇禁聲張、迫其下車、一人持槍開右面車門似有所威脅、潘雖魁梧其軀、而機警非常、知非善類、於是一脚蹴開左面車門、身體一　猛力跳下、竄入交易所頭門内、狂呼綁票、</p>
<p>長警圍捕　當時門崗與街上行</p>
<p>人、始行注意、一致呼喊、該匪徒四人、各執手槍、揚長乘預停路旁之汽車向法租界逃逸、當被一區二分所得訊後、由毛巡官聖正率同全班長警、趕往圍捕、奈已無蹤、復至出事地點調查、嚴行查緝、惟據潘謂人、事前並未接得恐嚇信云、</p>

<p>— 偉男</p>
<p>……一個小小的紀念……</p>
<p>「阿姊、您站在當中吧、」</p>
<p>「是的、老姊姊應該在當中的、」</p>
<p>這是去年暑假期中的一天、那時我和芝同住在斜橋的一間亭子樓、度我們小家庭式的生活呢、每天照例到醫院去跑一趟外、其餘的時間便在那斗室裏了、我倆分工合作的過了一月多、覺得身體也較在學校時胖健得多了、</p>
<p>處在這强烈的陽光之下、冰淇淋店裏的老板也熟識起來了、晚上穿着拖鞋挾了把扇子不到他那邊去了、這様的又過了十多天、覺得太煩厭了、結果、又和西瓜相交了幾天、解我們的炎暑熱氣、</p>
<p>芝病了、芝眞的倒在床上不能和我同行了、這是我底責任呀、冰淇淋和西瓜好吃嗎、……這麽自責的想了一會、便催芝去求治了、</p>
<p>常常聚在一地的我倆、情如骨肉、何况芝是舉目無親的作客這裏呢、我爲這可憐的人兒難過、病勢日重一日了、我個人能力有限工芝後來曉得我的苦衷、便請了好底愛友青從杭來滬了、</p>
<p>青經騐比較來得豐富、好説到醫院去是便當些、芝無可無不可的允許了、我這時像出籠小鳥似的、輕鬆了不少、</p>
<p>住在醫院時、是多麽快樂呀、病者漸愈了、青和我也漸漸的相親起來了、三位一體的頭銜、張先生也曾這様説過、我們自己心中也早默認了、</p>
<p>剛把芝住的第五號病室佈置好我們的用具……斜橋住處的用品漸漸都搬到醫院了、……不料却又要離開它、我有點依戀着、但是病好了不住在那邊豈不是太不經濟了嗎、</p>
<p>離開學還有一星期、青又要回杭去了、我提議我們三人合拍一照、算是芝病中的看護紀念和送青的離滬紀念、三人同意了、急着要拍了、那時電車罷工、坐黃包車吧、得了同意、</p>
<p>年齡最少、而又要做人家的姊姊的我、最喜歡人家呼我做姊姊、芝和青都明白這道理、又在親親熱熱的呼我了、我高興、有這兩位好妹妹站在兩傍、增中老姊姊的福氣、</p>
<p>聚散無常、人事滄桑、這眞不錯呢、我久未見青了、芝又回鄕去了、我呢、雖則仍度着學校生活、但是近日學校空氣十二分緊張呀、立案的問題、假使我們不努力而不能達到目的時、我不得已要離開這些老友和親愛的上海了、青呀、芝呀、我想念您們、遠望着您們的佳音、我對着我們合拍的小照、寫了這些回憶舊事的稿子、您們能看到嗎、您們能同時想起了您們的老姊姊嗎、</p>

<p>Discussion on Industrial Proposal Incomplete</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Assembly held its fifth general meeting on the morning of the 13th at 9:30 AM. 493 delegates and central National Government members were present, with 63 attending as observers. The presidium consisted of Yu Youren, Zhang Xueliang, Dai Chuanxian, Zhang Ji, Wu Tiecheng, Chen Lifu, Zhou Zuomin, Liu Chunyi, and Lin Zhifu, with Wu Tiecheng presiding.</p>

<p>(2) Review Committee Report</p>
<p>(3) Report Documents: (1) Delegates Wang Yansong and Hou Dachun each requested a one-day leave of absence. (2) The Assembly received 17 additional congratulatory telegrams. Discussion Items</p>
<p>(1) Delegate Ma Yinbing and others proposed a resolution for the Assembly to accept all of the late Premier's teachings and issue a declaration to inform the national populace, urging them to sincerely accept and diligently implement them. Additionally, Delegate Zeng Jikuan and others made a temporary motion for all representatives of the National Assembly, on behalf of the national populace, to sincerely accept all of the Chinese Nationalist Party Premier's teachings. The two proposals were combined for discussion. Ma Yinbing and Zeng Jikuan explained the purposes of the proposals in turn. The chairman then put it to a vote, and it was unanimously passed by all, followed by three minutes of silence to express sincere acceptance. The presidium then designated eleven people, including Ye Chucang, Shao Lizi, Chen Bulei, and Zeng Jikuan, to draft a declaration accepting all of the late Premier's teachings, to be convened by Ye Chucang.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) At the fifth meeting of the National Assembly on the 13th, the Declaration of the National Assembly on the Abolition of Unequal Treaties was passed. The original</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>text is as follows:</p>
<p>"China has been bound by unequal treaties for several decades. Although these unequal treaties were concluded at different times, they all harm the sovereignty of our independent nation and hinder the survival and development of our people. The treaty countries, at that time, took advantage of the lack of public awareness in our country and used the hands of our ignorant and autocratic government to conclude these contracts that violate the principles of fairness, as a guarantee for seizing unjust rights. This not only violates international justice and common sense but is also a stain on modern civilization. Since the conclusion of these treaties, the harm and suffering suffered by the Chinese nation have not only been in the economic field, with impoverishment and poverty increasing daily due to the fulfillment of unilateral obligations, but also in the efforts to reform politics and complete the modern nation-state, facing many obstacles and difficulties. In the last three or four years, especially after the European War, the principle of national self-determination has become increasingly established. The Chinese people, awakened by national consciousness, have deeply felt the intolerability of this unreasonable shackle, and the efforts to break free from it have become increasingly vigorous. The national revolution led by Chinese Nationalist Party Premier Sun Yat-sen is the culmination of this movement, and the abolition of unequal treaties and the re-signing of new treaties that mutually respect sovereignty are listed as one of the important political programs of the Chinese Nationalist Party, which is enough to represent the unanimous demands of our 400 million people. Therefore, since the establishment of the National Government, in accordance with this public opinion, clear declarations have been made repeatedly regarding the correction of unequal international relations and the re-signing of new treaties of mutual equality, expecting a thorough awakening and correction from the treaty countries. Indeed, the Chinese nation is a nation that deeply loves justice and peace and does not want to assume that the actions of various countries in holding onto unilateral benefits indicate that they have no possibility of automatically abandoning them. However, as the facts have shown, although the people of various countries do not lack clear expressions of support for public opinion, the governments of various countries still stubbornly adhere to the basis of the treaty's validity or put forward unreasonable excuses, procrastinating and delaying in the hope of prolonging the life of these unequal treaties. The recent negotiations on legal jurisdiction are a clear example. This is truly contrary to what we expected and cannot but be regarded as a major shortcoming. The Chinese nation today is no longer comparable to before the revolution. The unification of the nation has been truly completed. The National Government, representing the entire nation, is eager to work hard on various important constructions to seek the interests of the nation and the people. Therefore, if we allow the various unequal treaties that undermine the integrity of our territorial sovereignty and suppress our political and economic development, as well as the various facts attached to the unequal treaties, to continue to exist, it will not only harm the nation's independence and security but also limit and obstruct the progress of various political reforms and constructions. This is something that the national populace, who adhere to the Three Principles of the People, cannot tolerate. The National Assembly, entrusted by the national populace, cannot ignore this major fact that endangers the survival of the nation. It believes that to remove the nation's shackles, the abolition of unequal treaties cannot be delayed any longer, nor is there any need for further expectations. It should declare their abolition with a resolute attitude. According to the precedents in international law, when there is a significant change in circumstances, one of the treaty countries may declare the abolition based on the principle of changed circumstances and replace it with a suitable treaty that conforms to the principles of fairness and the actual situation to avoid hindering the interests of the treaty countries and endangering international faith and peace. The unequal treaties concluded between China and various countries were all made decades ago. Compared with the situation at the time of the treaty and today, it cannot be considered that there has been a major and significant change. How can we continue to recognize the existence of such an unsuitable old treaty and endanger the survival of the nation? This is one reason. Our country is a member of the League of Nations. Article 19 of the Covenant of the League of Nations stipulates that "The Assembly may from time to time advise the reconsideration by Members of the League of treaties which have become inapplicable and the consideration of international conditions whose continuance might endanger the peace of the world." Although this clause was once submitted to the General Assembly of the League of Nations by our country's representative Wu Chaoshu, urging them to pay attention, it has not received due respect. However, the world cannot but recognize it as a general rule of international application. The old treaties between China and various countries that have not yet been abolished are biased in terms of rights and obligations, damaging sovereignty, and infringing on territory. There is no doubt that they are inapplicable. In order to strive for national equality and ensure world peace, we cannot recognize their continued prolongation. This is the second reason. Moreover, the reason why various countries hold onto unequal treaties is often based on some unrelated reasons, often using the facts of our country's internal affairs as conditions, without knowing that the improvement of our country's political affairs is based on the needs of our country itself and does not allow foreign interference, let alone the supervision of any foreign power. In terms of our country's actual achievements, such as the completion of various important legal codes in recent years and the reorganization of administration, except for some obstacles caused by the existence of unequal treaties, they are sufficient to prove our country's determination and ability to seek improvement. For example, in the past, foreign countries often used the realization of tariff autonomy as a prerequisite, and even said that after tariff autonomy, China would have no intention of abolishing the likin. However, the facts prove that after the complete realization of tariff autonomy, our country did not hesitate to make any sacrifices to abolish the likin throughout the country in order to eliminate the long-standing malpractice. Therefore, those who use internal political reasons as a threat in foreign countries are just proving that they are reversing the facts. The determination and perseverance of China to reform politics will not hinder the rate of its rapid progress due to the fact that foreign countries do not abandon unequal treaties. This is the third reason. Based on the above reasons, the National Assembly, on behalf of the national populace, makes the following decisions and solemnly declares to the world:</p>
<p>(1) The Chinese nation does not recognize any unequal treaties that have been imposed on China by various countries in the past.</p>
<p>(2) The National Government should follow the late Premier's teachings and realize the complete equality and freedom of the Republic of China in the international arena in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>The decision on the right is not only necessary to defend the survival of the Chinese nation, but also enough to eliminate the obstacles to world peace and wash away the stain of modern civilization. We firmly believe that all countries in the world will be able to deeply understand this firm expression, and our national compatriots will certainly unanimously support this decision, without fear of any difficulties and sacrifices. This declaration is hereby made."</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Declaration on the Abolition of Treaties passed by the National Assembly on the 13th has been translated into English and Japanese by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and telegraphed to the embassies and consulates abroad for their information.

<h3 id="e4">Proposal to Accept the Late Premier's Teachings <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) At the fifth meeting of the National Assembly on the 13th, the National Assembly passed the proposal that all representatives of the National Assembly, on behalf of the national populace, respectfully accept the teachings of the Chinese Nationalist Party Premier. The original text of the proposal is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(A) It is proposed that the Assembly resolve to accept all of the late Premier's teachings and issue a declaration to inform the national populace, urging them to sincerely accept and diligently implement them. (Reason) The late Premier of our Party, Sun Yat-sen, devoted himself to the national revolution for forty years. In these forty years, he not only overthrew the thousands-year-old autocratic system and built the current republican nation but also, with forty years of experience, stipulated the procedures and steps for China to achieve freedom and equality. Twenty years have passed since the establishment of the Republic of China, but China has not yet achieved the goal of freedom and equality. The biggest reason is that although the late Premier's propositions are a good medicine for saving the nation, the level of the national populace has not yet been able to thoroughly understand and support them. Therefore, in his declaration on going north, the late Premier still said that convening a national assembly would enable the national populace to thoroughly understand and support the Party's propositions. Now that the National Assembly has been realized, it should naturally recognize the late Premier's teachings as a good medicine for saving China and should clearly declare and express unanimous acceptance so that the national populace can work together under the same goal. Is this appropriate? Please make a public decision. (Measures) Issue a declaration in the name of this Assembly to accept all of the late Premier's teachings to inform the national populace, urging them to sincerely accept and diligently implement them. Proponents: Ma Yinbing and 110 others.</p>
<p>(B) All members of the National Assembly, representing the national populace, respectfully and sincerely accept the teachings of the Chinese Nationalist Party Premier. (Reason) This time, the National Government, in accordance with the teachings of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen, convened the National Assembly to seek the unification and construction of China. It has already formulated a draft of the Provisional Constitution for the Period of Political Tutelage in accordance with the Outline of National Reconstruction and submitted it to the Assembly for approval as a fundamental plan for national construction. At the same time, all representatives of the National Assembly unanimously and respectfully swore an oath before the meeting to abide by Mr. Sun's Three Principles of the People and, under the guidance of the Chinese Nationalist Party, to seek the political tutelage and construction of the nation. This not only recognizes that political tutelage is extremely important in China at present but also recognizes that the highest guiding body for implementing political tutelage is only the Chinese Nationalist Party, which implements the Three Principles of the People. Since the National Assembly represents the national populace and accepts the draft of the Provisional Constitution for the Period of Political Tutelage submitted by the National Government, it is especially necessary to solemnly express its absolute obedience to the guidance of the Chinese Nationalist Party, the highest guiding body for implementing political tutelage, during the period of political tutelage, in order to conform to the late Premier Sun Yat-sen's teaching of ruling the country with the Party. Only then can the National Assembly show the national populace that there is a common belief and trend. It is hereby proposed that, in the name of the plenary meeting of the National Assembly, representing the national populace, it respectfully and sincerely accept all the teachings of the Chinese Nationalist Party Premier, and that the national populace absolutely obey the guidance of the Chinese Nationalist Party during the period of political tutelage in order to complete the construction of political tutelage as soon as possible and promote the realization of constitutionalism. Is this appropriate? Please make a public decision. Temporary movers: Zeng Jikuan and 75 others. (13th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e5">Industrial Construction Program <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(1) Review Report</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The full text of the review report on the industrial construction program is as follows: "Having been submitted by the Assembly, the review of the industrial construction program, and having been submitted by the Assembly and the presidium successively, seventeen opinion papers from various representatives, we convened two review meetings on the afternoons of the 9th and 12th, respectively, and carefully reviewed and discussed them item by item. All agreed that the ten programs listed in the original proposal are urgently needed for industrial construction during the national construction period. The National Government should follow this proposal, plan year by year, to enrich the country and benefit the people's livelihood. All Chinese people should unanimously accept it and assist the government with all their strength to promote its gradual realization on schedule. In addition, all the opinions in the opinion papers that are relevant to the actual situation and agreed upon have been adopted, adding a section to the railway program in the second item of the original proposal and adding text to the agricultural program in the ninth item. Although the opinions of the other items are all based on the grand plan and legacy of the late Premier for industrial construction, it is limited by both talent and economy to carry them out simultaneously within six years. The only way is to prioritize the urgent over the slow to avoid disrupting the target. Moreover, the original proposal</p>

<h3 id="e6">Anti-Religious Movement in Spain <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>The anti-religious movement in Spain is becoming increasingly serious. The destruction of churches and temples, and the deaths and injuries of church members, are still being discovered in various places. The Roman Pope has also instructed his envoy to protest to Spain. The cause of this matter is understandable. When the Spanish Republican Government was established, the Ministry of Justice announced the abolition of Catholicism as the state religion. In its note to the papal envoy, it stated that the new government would treat all religions equally from now on. At that time, the Holy See did not express dissatisfaction, but the sudden loss of its exclusive position by its followers in Spain could not but cause resentment. The reason why the new government first intended to do this was that Catholics have always been the backbone of the monarchist party, and it was feared that they would help the opposition in the future, so this preemptive measure was taken. The reporter once commented on this matter, considering it one of the new government's major concerns, but did not expect it to suddenly break out today. The people's resentment against the Catholic followers has been deep, and the Catholic followers are eager to restore their lost power, so they are forced to form this violent act. According to today's Reuters report, weapons, bullets and documents were found in a temple in Valencia, proving that the temple's believers conspired to resist the Republican government in order to revive the imperial system. Therefore, it is known that the anti-Catholicism of the Spanish people this time is not purely anti-Catholicism, but actually has political problems mixed in it. It is not easy to clean up for a while. This is also not necessary to bother to say</p>

<p>is a program outline for industrial construction, and opinions involving trivial details can naturally be omitted. The revisions and additions are now presented with explanations for submission to the Assembly. Is this appropriate? Please make a public decision. Kong Xiangxi, of the Financial and Economic Planning and Investigation Committee."</p>
<p>(2) Revised Points</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The results of the review of the industrial construction program have been revised as follows:</p>
<p>(Original Second Item) Complete the following railways within a limited time according to the urgent needs of the current national economy and people's livelihood: (A) Yuehan Railway, Zhuzhou to Shaoguan, to be completed by the end of 1933; (B) Longhai Railway, (1) Tongguan to Xi'an section, to be completed by the end of 1932, (2) Xi'an to Lanzhou section, to be completed by the end of 1936, (3) Yunhe Station to Taierzhuang branch line, to be completed by January 1932; (C) Xinlongsui Railway, Baotou to Ningxia section, to be completed by June 1934; (D) Jingxiang Railway, Nanjing to Zhuzhou, to be completed by 1934; (E) Cangshi Railway, Cangzhou to Shijiazhuang, to be completed by the end of June 1932; (F) Other routes, such as the Guangzhou-Tengyue line, Guangzhou-Chongqing line, Tongzhang line, Taolu line, Zhangduo line, Hatao line, and Sichuan-Kang line, are all important. The government should actively plan and complete them within a limited time.</p>
<p>(Reason) Southwest and Northeast are important areas of the country, and they are important in terms of economy and national defense. Therefore, according to the opinions of the review committee members, the railway lines that should be prepared and laid in the Southwest and Northeast are supplemented as follows as a model for the government to continue to organize.</p>
<p>(Original Ninth Item) Regarding the increase in agricultural production, the principle of scientific agriculture should be adopted. In addition to important constructions such as water conservancy and electricity, attention should be paid to the experimentation and improvement of agricultural products and the promotion of afforestation. Experimental county areas should also be designated in each province as models for improving agriculture. The detailed plan should be formulated and implemented by the National Government.</p>
<p>(Amendment) Ninth item. Regarding the increase in agricultural production, the principle of scientific agriculture should be adopted. In addition to constructions such as water conservancy and electricity, attention should be paid to the experimentation and improvement of agricultural products, encouraging the increase of agricultural products, and the promotion of afforestation, as well as the development of fisheries and animal husbandry. Experimental county areas should also be designated in the rear provinces as models for improving agriculture. The detailed plan should be formulated and implemented by the National Government.</p>
<p>(Reason) The original text did not mention the encouragement of increasing agriculture, and the development of fisheries and animal husbandry is also important, so it is proposed to amend it as right to be comprehensive.</p>
<p>(3) Review Report on Agricultural Plan</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Review report on the proposal to determine the five-year agricultural plan to enrich people's livelihood. Having been submitted by the Assembly, the proposal to determine the five-year plan for the development of agriculture to enrich people's livelihood was reviewed in conjunction with the industrial construction program. In addition, five opinion papers from representatives regarding this proposal were submitted by the presidium. We submitted it to the second joint meeting on the 12th for joint review with the ninth item of the industrial construction program. After discussion, it was found that the six aspects of this proposal, namely, immigrating and colonizing the border areas, clearing and measuring land, repairing rivers, establishing agricultural banks, developing rural agricultural education, and establishing rural cooperatives, were either covered in special articles in the Provisional Constitution, or were mutually seen in other proposals, or had already been handled by the government. The industrial construction program is a summary of the industrial construction program, and the ninth item has a general chapter on agricultural issues. The decision was made: "Please forward the Assembly to the National Government for consideration and handling." The review opinions are attached hereto for submission to the Assembly. Is this appropriate? Please make a public decision. Kong Xiangxi, Convenor of the Joint Meeting of the Financial and Economic Review Committee.</p>

<p>(2) Resolution</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The resolution on the review report of the general political report is as follows: This Assembly accepts the review report of the special review committee on the National Government's general political report, and considers that the statements made by the National Government are very faithful. Although the late Premier has passed away, his teachings will be illuminated in the world. The National Government, inheriting the late Premier's teachings, although its measures have not been fully realized due to various relationships, such as the repeated rebellions of warlords, the incitement of Red bandits, the instability of society, and the impurity of thought, the spirit of its hard work and integrity to pursue one goal is understood by this Assembly. However, from now on, there will be more clues and more difficulties. This Assembly, representing the national populace, will also increasingly supervise and urge the National Government. The National Government should continue to abide by the late Premier's teachings to eliminate all obstacles, implement the Provisional Constitution and all resolutions formulated by this Assembly, and strive to move forward to complete the political tutelage and ascend to the constitutional period in order to build the welfare of the national populace and start the foundation of the Republic of China. There are high hopes. (13th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Education Review Committee's review report is as follows: Having received the "Proposal to Determine the Trend of Educational Facilities" submitted by the National Government, the committee convened for review at 3 PM on the 11th of this month. Forty-eight members attended. The various opinions expressed by the delegates at the conference regarding this proposal were summarized into nineteen items. Additionally, two items were proposed by the delegates attending the conference. All of these were presented by the chairman for detailed discussion, item by item. However, because each of the proposed items was either already stipulated in the "Educational Aim and Implementation Policy of the Republic of China" announced by the National Government on April 26, 1929, or already listed in Chapter 5 of the Provisional Constitution, or not closely related to the special purpose of this proposal by the government, and would even slightly hinder the consistent spirit of the entire proposal, none of them received majority approval. The result of the discussion was a decision to pass the original proposal's articles, with the exception of adding the three characters "智識與" [knowledge and] under the third item "Assist in their production." This report is respectfully submitted for public decision. Report by Cai Yuanpei, Convener of the Education Review Committee. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e15">He Yingqin's Explanation of the Bandit Suppression Report (Continued from Yesterday) <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) But [the losses] are comparable. These are only what can be easily seen and recorded in cities, villages, and towns. The losses of life and property in remote, desolate areas are even more unknown. Let us imagine that if this scourge spreads, then the annual loss of life and property nationwide will be a terrifying number. Therefore, we must not regard Mao Zedong as insignificant. If we do not exert ourselves, it is possible that the disasters of Huang Chao in the Tang Dynasty and the roving bandits at the end of the Ming Dynasty will reappear today. Originally, the roving bandits of previous dynasties had their own advantages. The Red Bandits, in addition to these advantages, also have other insidious tactics. First, the roving bandits do not hesitate to sacrifice the people, while the government troops must always consider the peace and tranquility of the region. Because the Red Bandits adopt this evil plan of not hesitating to sacrifice, the people cannot but fear and follow them. Because the government troops cannot kill indiscriminately, the people will not fear them. Zeng Guofan, when suppressing the Taiping rebels, also said, "It is necessary to make them fear me as much as they fear the bandits." This was an angry remark that saw through the bandits' tricks. Therefore, the Red Bandits can burn houses, force people up the mountains, go without food and forage wherever they go, and force the people to act as Red Guards to block the front lines. But of course, we cannot do any of these things. Second, roving bandits always take advantage of dangerous terrain, coercing the natives. Therefore, the terrain is always unfamiliar to us, but they can constantly harass and flee. Third, they fool the peasants. This is also a very cunning method that has been used by roving bandits throughout history. They incite tenant farmers to divide the land, but in reality, the rent is all taken by the bandits. This is based on facts and is not fabricated. They use hired farmers to divide the land, but in reality, it is like a heron playing with an egret, not allowing it to eat anything. Therefore, the bandits use various deceptive methods to incite the villagers, and the result is completely to use them as cannon fodder. Fourth, they fool the soldiers. They deceive the soldiers, saying they will get ten yuan a month, but in reality, it is less than three yuan, and the treatment is harsh, and the defenses are so dangerous that no one can endure it. Fifth, they develop people's bestial desires, tearing apart families, and then specializing in using them for banditry. Therefore, women and children are also used by the bandits as propaganda tools. In summary, the Red Bandits' strategy is summarized by the four characters "兇狼狡詐" [fierce wolf, cunning and deceitful]: Murder and arson are fierce, sacrificing the masses is ruthless, avoiding the strong and attacking the weak is cunning, and deceiving the peasants and workers is deceitful. In short, the Red Bandits are unscrupulous for their purpose. As long as they can seize power, they will do anything. Regarding a more detailed analysis, I have another booklet to distribute for your reference. In the past, the National Government could not eliminate bandits early on because it was focused on quelling warlords. Now, the government is determined to quickly eliminate the bandits. Jiangxi is currently the bandits' base, so the government has sent 200,000 troops to encircle and suppress them and has ordered me to go to Jiangxi to preside over the bandit suppression military affairs. This time, since the bandit suppression has a final determination, all past mistakes must be corrected. In the past, because the power of the bandits was underestimated, we were often ambushed and suffered small losses. Secondly, there were no supply stations, and transportation was very inconvenient, so the bandits could use the method of clearing the fields to trap us. Thirdly, our military pay was sometimes not fully paid, so the bandits could take the opportunity to incite them. Fourthly, we did not have political training at that time, and misleading propaganda could not be seen through by the people. But now these mistakes have been corrected. We now have a bandit suppression propaganda office, and the advancing troops have many supply stations. The military pay for the bandit suppression troops is paid according to 80% of the budget, with no delays. So these situations are more advanced than before. Currently, we must use the strategy of advancing step by step to gradually eliminate them, so that they have no way to use their skirmish tactics, and then we can gather and annihilate them. In Jiangxi, since the encirclement and suppression last month, the bandits' momentum has declined. Counties such as Guangchang, Tonggu, Yongfeng, Le'an, Ningdu, and Taihe have now been recovered. We are now attacking the bandits' old nest—various key points near Ningdu. The main force of the bandits in eastern Hubei was defeated by our Ji unit. The large groups of Red Bandits in Baodu Mountain in Shandong and within Hunan have been completely eliminated. Now, if there are no other problems, we can definitely completely eliminate the Red Bandits. From the reasons for the Red Bandits' rampancy and the current disasters, we have fully understood that the Red Bandits are a great disaster for our nation and ourselves. There must be three trends. One is to send China as a vassal state to the red imperialists. It is clear that the Chinese Communist Party is directly under the command of the Third International. The bandits' so-called Soviet is also under the command of the bandit party. As evidenced by past facts, the important leaders of the bandit party often advance or retreat according to the joys and sorrows of the red imperialists. Then, is the supreme ruling power of China not in the hands of foreigners? We know that so-called national self-determination, whether with good intentions or bad, presupposes not being interfered with by foreign forces. If we follow the Red Bandits' method, what self-determination is there to speak of? Even the concept of a nation-state can be dispensed with. Another major disaster is that unprecedented deaths and sacrifices will appear in China. We all know the losses suffered during the Russian Revolution, and the number of people who died. No matter how much they are promoting progress now, the past sacrifices cannot be made up for in a few decades. In China, it is completely like the ancient roving bandits' style of killing and looting. Then, the sacrifices will be at least a hundred times greater than those in Russia. In this great sacrifice, the Red Bandits can then stimulate people's murderous emotions, develop people's bestial desires, and then use them as good tools. The disaster of so-called floods and fierce beasts is nothing more than that. In addition, this group of bandits will rely on this expected chaos to seize power and slaughter the people. At the same time, the internal disputes within the bandit party will also expand. Of course, with the bandits' current strength, they cannot yet realize this great disaster. But if we are negligent and underestimate the enemy, then it cannot be predicted. Therefore, the task of suppressing the bandits now is not only the responsibility of the government but also the responsibility of all the people. This is a personal issue and a national issue. For the sake of the nation and for the sake of ourselves, everyone should take on the task of suppressing the bandits. From the analysis of the causes of the Red Bandits, we can understand that the suppression of the bandits must also be aimed at their causes. In addition to improving the education policy and improving the lives of farmers, the provincial government should be responsible. There are three things that we as a nation must pay attention to. First, we must start by revitalizing the national spirit and restoring national self-confidence. We must use this spirit and self-confidence to unite all the people to suppress this bandit party that acts as a running dog for foreigners. We must use this spirit and self-confidence to eliminate all personal opinions and private interests. Second, we must wholeheartedly support the central peace and unification. Only permanent peace and unification can eliminate the separatism of the warlords and enable organized resistance. Third, we must strengthen our own self-defense organizations so that bandits cannot find a place to stay, and our own unity will never be broken by small things. If everyone can understand the sins of the Red Bandits and understand their own responsibilities, and do it according to the simple three points, then we believe that the elimination of the Red Bandits is imminent.

Measures: In recent years, the five rivers in North China have undergone surveying and planning by the central government's specially established water conservancy agencies, and many plans have been completed. The overall strategy for the management of the Liao River has been outlined by Premier Sun Yat-sen. Concrete plans have also been drafted for the Huludao commercial port. If funds can be raised, it will not be difficult to plan and start construction. According to the use of the British Boxer Indemnity, it was previously decided at the Second Plenary Session to allocate one-third of the total amount for water conservancy and electrical undertakings. Subsequently, the central political conference resolved the allocation method, but North China was not included. In 1922, the British government sent personnel to China to investigate the use of the refunded indemnity and deemed the construction of water conservancy in North China as one of the appropriate uses. Therefore, the exchange of notes between China and Britain specified that the use of the funds should refer to the 1926 report of the Boxer Indemnity Advisory Committee organized by the British government. The report recommended that, in addition to a portion being used as education subsidies, public bonds should be issued to build the Guangdong-Hankou Railway and manage the Shunzhi Water Conservancy (Shunzhi being the scope of North China). There is a basis for including it earlier. Therefore, it is requested that a slight change be made and a portion be allocated from the designated water conservancy special funds to be reserved for the above-mentioned water conservancy and transportation projects.

<h3 id="e19">Proposal to Vigorously Implement Protection and Encouragement Policies <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Li Shengbo proposed that the government should vigorously implement protection and encouragement policies and ban foreign merchants from establishing factories to save the national goods from danger. Key Points: (A) If the government considers the effectiveness of national goods to be widespread and if they engage in similar industries as foreign merchants, they may increase the tax rate. All the increased taxes from Chinese merchants will be fully returned as a bonus to protect existing national products and to encourage future enterprises. (B) Abolish unequal treaties and recover concessions. The Prime Minister's last words are brilliant and are what the Chinese people unanimously desire. Before the abolition and recovery, foreign merchants should be banned from entering outside the concessions to establish factories. The factories that have already been established in the concessions should be subject to special registration regulations established by the government and strictly restricted.

However, in addition to the various departments, a Buddhist Committee should be established to rally support and should never be merged into other departments to reduce its prestige and arouse the resentment of the lamas, hindering the progress of governance. The organizational laws of the committee should be promulgated and implemented by the National Government to demonstrate prudence. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Panchen Lama hosted a banquet for the entire press at the Central Hotel on the afternoon of the 13th, with more than eighty people attending. The Panchen Lama reported that Tibet is Chinese territory, and its administrative relationship is closest to China. Since the establishment of the Republic of China, there have been no barriers between China and Tibet, resulting in administrative phenomena that differ from the old days. The Panchen Lama's pleas have been ongoing for nine years, only because the situation has not been stable and the government has been unable to quickly resolve Tibetan affairs. The people of Tibet and Kang have also been yearning for governance in the western borderlands, and have been calling for help for years without success. Now that the People's Congress has opened and representatives from all over the country have expressed their great views to consolidate our national foundation, the government is also making every effort to unify even the remote border areas. I sincerely hope that the press will uphold Premier Sun Yat-sen's intention to help the weak and support the falling and unanimously support this, so that the ethnic groups in the western borderlands can enjoy freedom, equality, and well-being with the Chinese people.

<p>The Pope Lodges a Protest</p>
<p>The Government's External Credit Shaken</p>
<p>Loan Agreements Temporarily Difficult to Conclude</p>
<p>National News Agency, Madrid, 13th: The turmoil in Spain is intensifying today. Angered by long-standing resentment towards the Catholic Church, the people have repeatedly clashed with the military. In Cordoba, a mob attacked a Catholic church, leading to a clash with the militia, resulting in two deaths and five injuries. Two militiamen were also injured. In Alicante, there were renewed instances of setting fire to churches. In Valencia, one monastery and five church buildings were destroyed. Two more monasteries were set on fire by the mob, and the fire is still burning. Martial law has now been declared in the area. In Granada, martial law has also been declared due to anti-religious acts. The people have long-standing grievances against the church, and upon hearing reports of sympathy for a restoration, they have become uncontrollably enraged.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Madrid, 12th: Although the authorities in the capital are able to control the situation with force, the destruction of idols and anti-religious actions are rampant throughout the country. Monasteries and churches in places such as Cadiz, Seville, and Alicante have been burned down by mobs. The ancient Archbishop's Palace in Malaga has also been looted. Similar disturbances have occurred in Cordoba. Seville suffered the greatest losses, with the burning of a church seminary, two St. Joseph's monasteries, and one church. All idols, ornaments, and other items were piled up in the square and burned. Monks and nuns fled in all directions. Although the authorities quickly declared martial law, the people remained like drunkards and maniacs, and could not be stopped. The Radical Party has declared that it will form an extreme Republican Party, whose policies include the dissolution of the army and navy, the confiscation of land, and the management of factories by workers. This declaration clearly leans towards communism. The final clause stated that the government is unable to carry out a genuine revolution, but only the armed people can do it. Without experiencing a period of terror, it is difficult for the Spanish Republican government to be established. Cadiz and Alicante have now declared martial law. The Communist Party attempted to attack the Montjuïc Fortress in Barcelona, but was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Reuters, Madrid, 13th: Martial law has been declared in Granada. It is reported that rioters in Cordoba looted gun shops, resulting in four deaths and ten injuries. It is extremely difficult for the police to restore order. It is also reported that weapons, ammunition, and documents were found in a monastery in Valencia, proving that the monks in the monastery were conspiring to resist the militia. Bishop Segura was asked to resign by the public and has reportedly left the territory of Toledo by car under police escort. The Minister of Finance explained the reason for the closure of the stock exchange, saying that the authorities discovered that a well-known financier was trying to trigger an economic crisis and take the opportunity to restore the monarchy.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Madrid, 12th: The situation in Spain remains tense. Twenty-seven monasteries have been burned down in the past two days, with Madrid being the most affected, accounting for twelve.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Rome, 12th: According to sources close to the Pope, the Pope has instructed the envoy to Madrid to lodge a serious protest with the Spanish government, demanding an apology and punishment of the perpetrators, because the Spanish authorities have failed to provide effective protection for the organization and property of the church. However, the Spanish provisional government, in order to avoid future disputes due to the strong momentum of the radical elements, is likely to reject the Pope's request. Reuters, Madrid, 12th: The Spanish prosecutor claims that he will file a public lawsuit against the deposed King Alfonso regarding the recent disturbances, because the close relationship between the deposed king and some nobles must be immediately investigated. The deposed king is currently in court. Dr. Apinan and the director of the Monarchist Association were arrested and imprisoned this afternoon.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Madrid, 12th: It is widely rumored in financial circles that the loan negotiations between the Spanish government and the American Morgan Company have been temporarily suspended. It is reported that they plan to borrow from British and French banks on more favorable terms. However, since the recent riots, foreigners' trust in the new government has been shaken. Therefore, a large loan agreement may be difficult to conclude for the time being.</p>

<p>Briand and Doumer Compete</p>
<p>The Desolate Former Palace Suddenly Becomes Lively</p>
<p>National News Agency, Versailles, 13th: Today at noon, 900 members of the French Senate and Chamber of Deputies gathered in the historically famous Great Hall of Versailles Palace to elect the twelfth president. It is expected that after three rounds of voting, Foreign Minister Briand will be elected. Since this morning, special trains, countless tour buses, and private cars have been carrying deputies, journalists, politicians, and tourists to gather in the square outside the palace. Temporary candy shops and other stalls are decorating the grand event. The normally desolate and deserted former palace has suddenly become a grand festive venue.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 13th: The left-wing factions of the French Chamber of Deputies and the left-wing Republican Party of the Senate have decided to support Doumer as president.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 12th: It has been learned that Foreign Minister Briand and Senate President Doumer will have a fierce competition in the presidential election. Minister of Military Affairs Maginot has clearly indicated that he will give up his candidacy. Therefore, Doumer is confident that the right-wing figures who originally planned to elect Maginot will vote in favor of Doumer. However, according to his observation, some people in the right-wing are also willing to vote for Briand in order to get Briand to leave the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and abandon his active political career. As for the third candidate, Brandy King Hennessy, there is little hope. In the future, after Briand is elected, Premier Laval will succeed him in attending the Pan-European Conference and the League of Nations Council meetings.</p>

<p>Italy, Austria, and Hungary Reach Understanding</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 13th: According to a Rome dispatch, negotiations between Italy, Austria, and Hungary on concluding a credit agreement to promote commerce have reached an understanding in principle. German newspapers expressed great welcome to this news, believing it to be a good omen for the Geneva Conference, because in the future, in the debate over the German-Austrian customs union, this can be used to unite Germany, Austria, Hungary, and Italy to counter the alliance of France, Poland, and the Little Entente, and allow Britain to act as a mediator. The German-Austrian tax agreement plan has stipulated from the beginning that other countries can be invited to join, without geographical restrictions. This also proves that France's accusation that Germany and Austria intend to establish a new Central European state is completely fabricated.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 12th: The British Secretary of Commerce stated in the House of Commons today that Austria, Belgium, France, Italy, Germany, Poland, and Switzerland have all expressed their willingness to consider proposals to reduce tax rates in order to begin negotiations. Therefore, Britain's proposal has now been put forward, but detailed negotiations have not yet begun.</p>

<p>To the Newspaper Offices, Nanjing: Recently, there have been rumors that the military and political authorities in Guangdong have suggested establishing a separate government from the Central Government. Sichuan is located in a remote western area, and news is delayed, so the details cannot be heard. It is speculated that those holding dissenting opinions are remnants of the reactionary Gui clique, as well as frustrated politicians, with other intentions. No matter what reasons they hold, their intentions are nothing more than to use the opportunity to incite chaos, hoping to destroy the unification, which goes against the teachings of Sun Yat-sen, and is intolerable to the party and the country. Since the chaos has just been quelled and the country is on the right track, we look forward to entering constitutional rule and starting construction. All citizens of the country, hoping for progress, and sympathizing with the current situation. At a time when suppressing the communists domestically and recovering extraterritoriality are about to succeed, all of our compatriots should arouse their conscience and work together to assist. Even if those in power occasionally fail to meet expectations in their measures, they should sincerely consult and work together to overcome difficulties. It is absolutely impossible to use personal grievances to harm the fundamental interests of the country. Hunan and others, far away in western Sichuan, support the Central Government and remain steadfast in their determination. In addition to reorganizing our troops, we will also strengthen ties with neighboring borders and strive to serve the Central Government. We hope that our comrades in the party and the people of the country will speak out for justice in order to eliminate troubles and complete the unification. This is our greatest hope. We respectfully submit our words and ask for your consideration. Sichuan Rehabilitation Supervisor Liu Xiang, Chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Government Liu Wenhui, Yu Yin, Chief of General Staff Yuan You.</p>

<p>Zhang Xueliang Telegraphed Shanxi Agreeing to Allocate Funds</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: Since returning to Shanxi from Beiping, the Shanxi generals have been waiting for Shang Zhen to return to negotiate issues such as troop reduction and military pay, so they have been staying in Shanxi. After several discussions, since Shang's return has no fixed date, and they have been away from their posts for a long time, their troops need to be trained after being reduced, they decided to return to their posts in the coming days. Regarding the issue of military pay, Zhang Xueliang recently telegraphed, agreeing to pay from May 1st. The generals are extremely grateful and plan to jointly telegraph Zhang to express their gratitude and request that the funds they are entitled to be allocated as soon as possible to alleviate their urgent needs. At the same time, it was decided to send personnel to Nanjing to directly request instructions on how to claim the funds.</p>
<p>The situation in southern Shanxi is still very serious. It is recently rumored that the Hedong salt funds have been intercepted because the military pay for the troops stationed there is not available. Liang Shouguo, the Hedong salt transport envoy, has come to the province to request instructions on how to deal with the situation. This matter concerns national tax revenues and involves local administration. If this precedent is set, it will only increase disputes. The previous disturbances in the Fenyang garrison, although clarified by all parties, were said to have originated from misunderstandings. However, recently, with various troops intermingling, robbery cases are still being reported daily. Therefore, the county is currently negotiating with the military and will provide 50,000 yuan in Shanxi currency per month to the garrison to maintain law and order.</p>
<p>As for the weather in the province, there has been widespread rainfall in the past three days, so the people's hearts are gradually stabilizing. This is also a piece of good news in the midst of the precarious situation in Shanxi. (May 9th)</p>

<p>Published After the Panchen Lama's Arrival in Beijing</p>
<p>Urging the Government to Resolve Tibetan Affairs</p>
<p>Since the time of Tsongkhapa, who founded the Yellow Sect during the Yongle reign of the Ming Dynasty, the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama, as his two disciples, have resided in the front and rear Tibet respectively, managing Tibetan affairs. In the 57th year of the Kangxi reign of the Qing Dynasty, the Dzungars invaded front Tibet, and the Dalai Lama took refuge in the塔尔寺 Ta'er Monastery in Xining. The Qing court ordered 傳爾丹噶爾弼 Chu'er Dan Ga'er Bi and others to lead troops from Qinghai and Sichuan in two routes to attack Tibet. The Dzungar army was defeated, and the Dalai Lama was reinstated in the 59th year of Kangxi. Two thousand Mongolian soldiers were left to garrison Tibet but were soon withdrawn. In the 7th year of the Yongzheng reign, the rebellion of 阿爾布巴 A'er Bu Ba was quelled, and two high officials, a principal and a deputy, were sent with two thousand soldiers from Sichuan and Shaanxi to garrison front and rear Tibet. In the 15th year of the Qianlong reign, the number of troops stationed in Tibet was increased by fifteen hundred. In the 22nd year, 伊犂 Yili was pacified, and front Tibet was free from the troubles of the Dzungars. In the 55th year, the Gurkhas invaded rear Tibet, and the Panchen Lama took refuge in front Tibet. The Qing court ordered 福康安 Fu Kang'an and 海蘭察 Hai Lan Cha to lead troops from Qinghai to rear Tibet, defeating the Gurkhas and entering their territory for one hundred and sixty miles. The Gurkhas surrendered, and the Panchen Lama was reinstated. Three thousand Tibetan soldiers and one thousand Han and Mongolian soldiers were left to garrison Tibet. Regulations were also established for the two high officials, treating them equally with the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama, with unified authority. Rear Tibet was thus free from the troubles of the Gurkhas. From then on, China and Tibet were at peace for more than a hundred years. During the 17th year of the Guangxu reign, 德爾智 De'er Zhi, advocating pro-Russian ideas, served as a lecturer to the Dalai Lama, which aroused the ambition of Britain. Consequently, in the 29th year, they started a war in Lhasa. The Dalai Lama was defeated and sought help from Russia, going to Kulun to meet 哲布尊丹巴 Zhe Bu Zun Dan Ba, who introduced him to the Russian representative and telegraphed St. Petersburg. The Russian Tsar then presented four hundred sets of cavalry uniforms and equipment. The Qing court, upon learning of this, revoked the Dalai Lama's title and appointed the Panchen Lama to concurrently manage front Tibet, and secretly ordered the Kulun minister to intercept the Dalai Lama in the 丰熱吐 Feng Re Tu area of Outer Mongolia. The Dalai Lama, on his way, heard that Russia had been defeated by Japan, and then requested an audience and asked for troops to be sent to Tibet for defense. The Qing court advised the Dalai Lama to return to Tibet. The Dalai Lama then took the route through Xining. It was not until the tenth month of the first year of Xuantong that he arrived in Lhasa. Because of a strained relationship with 聯豫 Lian Yu, the resident minister in Tibet, he intended to go back on his word and obstruct the entry of troops into Tibet. However, in the sixth month of that year, Zhao Erxun, the governor of Sichuan, had already received an imperial decree, ordering Zhong Ying to lead a combined brigade to enter Tibet from 打箭鑪 Daqianlu, and arrived at Lari in December. The Dalai Lama mobilized Tibetan troops from Lhasa to 江達 Jiangda to set up defenses against the Han soldiers. He sent a letter inviting the Panchen Lama to send troops, but the Panchen Lama refused. After the Sichuan army attacked with infantry and artillery, the Tibetan troops could not hold out and retreated, pursued to 烏斯江 Wusijiang, five miles from Lhasa. At that time, Zhang Hongsheng, a committee member accompanying the army, borrowed dozens of infantrymen and took a shortcut to Lhasa, where he shot and killed a living Buddha in the crowd in the streets, and injured two or three people. The Tibetans were terrified and in a panic. The Dalai Lama, seeing this, was alarmed and asked the deputy minister Wen Zongyao to go up the mountain to request three conditions: to effectively protect the people, temples, and the Yellow Sect. Wen said that this was the original responsibility of the Han soldiers entering Tibet, and there was no need to set conditions. The Dalai Lama insisted, and Wen then consulted with Lian Yu. Unexpectedly, Lian Yu did not agree to the request. The Dalai Lama then led 虾渣卡弄 Xia Zha Ka Nong and others, going west along the river. When they were about to reach 錯木 Cuomu, a British military officer urgently telegraphed the London government, and received a reply instructing them to protect them properly and send them to Darjeeling as soon as possible. The Governor-General of India provided accommodation and other support. At that time, Chinese troops were stationed near Lhasa, and Lian Yu established military preparation and staff departments at the embassy, ​​no different from the governors of various provinces, and transferred Luo Changlu to succeed Zhong Ying as commander, accusing his soldiers of revolution every day. The soldiers were resentful. By the spring of the first year of the Republic of China, the Republic of China was established, and Commander Luo was killed in 工部 Gongbu in Tibet, and Lian Yu was also expelled. Zhong Ying appointed himself as the chief of affairs and commander. Because of his poor command of the soldiers, he aroused the anger of the Tibetans, who, under the orders of the Dalai Lama, cut off the Han soldiers' and merchants' food and salaries for more than a month. The Panchen Lama, taking pity on them, not only provided relief himself, but also secretly ordered the 第穆佛寺 Dimu Monastery and 布賚綳寺 Bulai Beng Monastery to provide relief successively. In the second year of the Republic of China, Xie Guoliang, the battalion commander of the Tu army, colluded with Tibet to attack Sichuan. The Sichuan army was about to be defeated, and after mediation by Nepal and representatives of the Panchen Lama, the Han soldiers surrendered their weapons. Later, the Gurkha company advanced funds to send the Han soldiers and merchants back to Shanghai from India. The Dalai Lama then returned to Tibet in October of the second year. The Tibetans sent troops to the Sichuan border, cutting off the eastern route and not allowing Han people to travel back and forth. Tibet continued to invade the east, and by the eighth and ninth years of the Republic of China, the Tibetan troops had occupied Ganzi on the Sichuan border, and seven or eight out of ten of all border areas had been lost. They deeply resented the Panchen Lama for providing food to the Sichuan army, and massacred all five hundred lamas of the 第穆佛寺 Dimu Monastery, burning down the temple. They also ordered the ten thousand lamas of the 布賚綳寺 Bulai Beng Monastery to collectively apologize. The monastery sent more than twenty representatives to Lhasa, where they were all subjected to torture. The discord between the Panchen Lama and the Dalai Lama arose from this. In the third year of the Republic of China, the Dalai Lama intended to seek independence, ceding the 錯那 Cuona area of Tibet to Britain, telegraphed the British government requesting its approval for independence, and asked it to send personnel to jointly resolve the pending issues between Britain and Tibet. The Chinese government sent Chen Yifan to the 赤姆納 Chimuna area in India to meet with the Dalai Lama, requesting independence, but Chen refused. The British then mediated, and designated the Lhasa, 洗自, and 槍駝 areas bordering Britain as Outer Tibet, and the 巴塘 Batang, 裏塘 Litang, and 塔多 areas bordering 西康 Xikang as Inner Tibet, and signed eight articles of agreement. The Panchen Lama, upon learning of this, feared that once the agreement was signed, national sovereignty and territory would be lost, and immediately telegraphed the chief of affairs stationed in Tibet, who forwarded the telegram to the government, and Chen was recalled. This matter was then shelved. Later, the Dalai Lama sent people to demand two million taels of silver and five hundred thousand shi of highland barley from rear Tibet every year. The Panchen Lama reluctantly agreed. Since the withdrawal of the Sichuan army from Tibetan territory, the Dalai Lama dispatched troops to garrison rear Tibet, occupying all the areas with abundant production. The military discipline was poor, and conscription was imposed on households, with all military uniforms and salaries borne by the conscripts. The people were resentful, and jointly requested the Panchen Lama to go to the mainland and seek relief from the central government. The Panchen Lama agreed. The Dalai Lama, upon hearing this news, invited the Panchen Lama to front Tibet to discuss resisting China, and threatened to resolve the matter with force if he disagreed. Fortunately, one of those involved in the discussion, a believer in the Panchen Lama, secretly reported the situation and advised him to leave quickly. The Panchen Lama then, in the eleventh month of the twelfth year of the Republic of China, lightly armed and with a reduced entourage, ventured out of Tibet. The Dalai Lama sent troops to pursue him, but the Tibetan troops deliberately moved slowly, so he was able to escape. The Panchen Lama arrived in Gansu and immediately sent a letter to the Dalai Lama, requesting him to send representatives to the central government to discuss Tibetan affairs, but received no reply. After arriving in Beiping, he again sent a trusted confidant of the Dalai Lama stationed in Beiping with a letter urging the Dalai Lama to lean towards the motherland, but again received no reply. The Panchen Lama has been in the mainland for nine years, and the government, due to the unresolved military affairs in the mainland, has not yet had a definite solution. Now, on the occasion of the National Assembly and the upcoming Tibetan Conference, all Chinese people should pay attention to the territorial and administrative relations of Tibet, and unanimously urge the government to resolve Tibetan affairs as soon as possible, which is the most urgent task of the day.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Japanese Monopolize North China Shipping <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Newly Built Four Ships Will Extend Routes to South China</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Qingdao is the only trading port in central China, with convenient shipping routes to Shanghai in the south and Yantai, Weihaiwei, Tianjin, and Dalian in the north. The most prosperous route is the Shanghai-Dalian line, which is exclusively operated by the Dalian Steamship Company, a Japanese company. The Shanghai-Qingdao line is operated by China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, 太古 Taikoo, 怡和 Jardine Matheson, and 三家 Sanjia. The Qingdao-Dalian route is operated by 政記公司 Zhengji Company. The ships of the Dalian Steamship Company operate on a regular schedule and are punctual, with large tonnage and high speed. Therefore, although the fares are high, the number of passengers does not decrease. The ships of this company operating between Shanghai and Dalian include 大連丸 Dalian Maru, 奉天丸 Fengtian Maru, and 長春丸 Changchun Maru, each of which is 4,500 tons. They sail on average once every three days. The fare from Qingdao to Shanghai is 70 yuan for first class, 50 yuan for second class, and 17 yuan for third class, and the journey takes 27 hours. The fare from Qingdao to Dalian is 50 yuan for first class, 35 yuan for second class, and 12 yuan for third class. This company was originally an affiliated agency of the South Manchuria Railway Company, specializing in attracting passengers and goods for the South Manchuria Railway. Gradually, it expanded and became the only shipping agency monopolizing China's coastal shipping. It is now reported that this company has even greater ambitions and will make every effort to expand shipping. Recently, it built four new ships, one of which is the 山東丸 Shandong Maru, about 4,500 tons, built by the 玉造 Shipyard in Okayama Prefecture, managed by 三井 Mitsui, and launched on the 15th of last month. The second is the 河北丸 Hebei Maru, also 4,500 tons, built by the Nagasaki Mitsubishi Shipyard, and launched on the 20th of last month. It will be completed and put into operation on the shipping routes this year. In addition, the 山西丸 Shanxi Maru and 河南丸 Henan Maru, both 4,500 tons, are also planned to be built. The company's predetermined plan is that once these four ships are completed in the future, they will extend the routes to South China, intending to completely seize the passenger and cargo transportation of 政記 Zhengji, 招商 China Merchants, 太古 Taikoo, and 怡和 Jardine Matheson, and attract customers with low prices. If this plan is realized, China's shipping industry will suffer a more significant blow. (May 10)</p>
<h3 id="e85">Qingdao Citizens Demand Cancellation of Rent Rights <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Clash Between Citizens and Security Team</p>
<p>City Authorities Agree to Temporarily Postpone Payment</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Previously, the citizens of Qingdao repeatedly sent representatives to the city authorities to request the cancellation of the additional rent rights levied by the municipal government, but without result. Now, the Finance Bureau has ordered the landlords to pay the rent rights within ten days, otherwise they will be detained. The landlords, under urgent circumstances, convened a general meeting at the 齊燕會館 Qi Yan Guild Hall on the 11th, with more than 400 people attending. It was decided to send the entire group to the Party and government to petition. They first went to the City 指委會 Steering Committee,</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>And elected Han Jiangshi, Mou Ziming, and Ye Yujie as representatives to meet with Wu Zunming, the Minister of Propaganda, and explained their intentions. Wu said that since it concerned the pain of the masses, the City Party Department would naturally find ways to help them eliminate it. The representatives left satisfied and went to the municipal government to petition. Because of the large number of people, the city authorities specially dispatched a small team of security forces to maintain order, and sent Yu Jinhe, the Director of the Public Security Bureau, to ask the petitioners to elect representatives for contact. However, the petitioners, considering that the 40 people previously elected as representatives had negotiated several times without any effect, stated that they were willing to meet with the authorities as a whole, and the group surged towards the gate. However, the security team tried their best to stop them, and a conflict arose between the two sides, and the order was disrupted for a time. The glass of the city government gate was also broken in the melee. As a result, three of the petitioners were seriously injured, including one named Wang Qinzhai, who was unconscious at the time, and more than 20 people were slightly injured. Several police officers were also injured. At the time, petitioners Zhou Ye, Jiao Jizong, Ye Yujie, Wang Zhaolin, and Mou Ziming re-entered the city government to meet with Hu Jiafeng, the Secretary-General, and explained that this petition was originally intended to be peaceful, but unexpectedly a violent incident occurred, causing injuries to many people, which they regretted very much. Secretary-General Hu also personally went to the outside of the city government gate to comfort the masses, saying that he was acting as mayor and that everything still needed to be reported to the mayor for approval, and a reply would be given within a week. The deadline for collecting the rent rights would be postponed for ten days. Therefore, the petitioners returned to the City Chamber of Commerce to discuss measures and decided to elect 90 representatives to be responsible for negotiating the following matters with the Party and government authorities on the 12th: (1) Cancel the rent rights; (2) Punish the police officers who used weapons to injure people; (3) Provide compensation to the injured masses. If there is no result, the City Chamber of Commerce will convene a citizens' meeting and send telegrams to the government and Party departments in various places for assistance. (May 12)</p>
<h3 id="e86">New Road Protection Measures Established for the Shenhai Railway <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Recently, banditry has been rampant in Northeast China, and cases of robbery and theft of vehicles have been frequently reported. Since the Pingji Railway opened to traffic, the Shenhai Railway has suddenly become an important transportation artery, and the number of travelers has increased day by day. However, the entire line extends for more than 250 kilometers, and the mountains and forests it passes through are complex, often frequented by bandits, and the police force is weak, making it difficult to provide comprehensive protection. Therefore, Chinese and foreign travelers are all wary. The railway authorities, therefore, submitted a request to the Liaoning Provincial Government and directly consulted with the Garrison Commander of Eastern Border to discuss measures to protect the line and passenger trains, and drafted twelve articles of service rules for the road protection army, which were submitted to the Northeast Frontier Defense Commander's Office for approval and implementation. In order to protect the line and defend local security, the Garrison Commander of Eastern Border also drew troops from the original jurisdiction and reorganized them into the First and Second Road Protection Army teams, and three independent detachments, and drafted thirteen articles of temporary regulations for the Road Protection Army, which were submitted to the Commander's Office for approval and forwarded to the Shenhai Railway for information. The service rules for the Shenhai Railway Road Protection Army are listed below: Article 1: In order to ensure the safety of passengers, this company requested the Liaoning Provincial Government to send 320 officers and soldiers from the Eastern Border Garrison Commander's Office to station along the line and patrol the line at any time to ensure security.

Article 3: The items and office buildings, coal, etc. required by the road protection army shall be supplied by the company, and the number shall be determined separately. A monthly subsidy of 2,000 yuan in silver shall be provided for the food expenses of the officers and soldiers, and all other expenses shall be borne by the army itself. Article 4: The official ranks, names, and number of officers and soldiers of the road protection army in each place shall be listed by the officers in charge and sent to the company for record. The same shall apply in case of replacement. Article 5: The road protection army should patrol the line every day, paying special attention to the following: (1) Whether there are bandits gathering near the railway, they must be strictly investigated and guarded against at any time; (2) If there are pedestrians walking on the roadbed, they should be strictly prohibited; (3) If the rails and mountain caves and bridges are destroyed or obstructed by bandits, they should immediately indicate a danger signal to stop the oncoming train and inform the workers to quickly rectify them; (4) If there are thieves or those who damage railway accessory items and electric wires and poles, they should be immediately apprehended and sent to the office for investigation. Article 6: The road protection army shall abide by all the rules of this road. Article 7: All members of the road protection army must wear specially made armbands to show identification. The style of the armband will be determined separately. Article 8: The road protection army is solely for the protection of the safety of the railway, and shall not interfere with the convenience of passengers and the handling of railway operations, unless required by the responsible personnel of the railway at all locations. Article 9: The road protection army, in addition to being subject to the orders of its superiors, must also obey the orders of the company when necessary, in order to achieve effective coordination. Article 10: The railway may, when necessary, request the garrison to withdraw the original defense or add personnel at any time. Article 11: These rules shall take effect from the date of approval. Article 12: These rules may be amended at any time if there are any omissions.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Suzhou Representatives Petition for Dredging of the Upstream Waterway of the Songkou <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Su merchants Li Shengbo, Qian Sunqing, Yu Xiaochuan, Wang Jingting, Lan Bohua, Zhang Shouyi and other representatives of the National Assembly have made concrete plans for dredging the upstream Yangtze River waterway of the Songkou in order to maintain the prosperity of Shanghai, and have formulated reasons and methods. Yesterday (the 13th), they submitted petitions to the National Government, the Ministry of Communications, and the Yangtze River Waterway Regulation Commission. Cai Pei, the director of the Shipping Administration Department of the Ministry of Communications, agreed to report to the National Government and earnestly proceed. The reasons and methods are recorded below: (A) Reasons: Shanghai is the third most prosperous city in the world, and it will not be difficult to advance to second and first place in the future. However, because it is located at the mouth of the world's fifth largest river, the Yangtze River, it has a close relationship with water conservancy. In the past, it dredged the Huangpu River, but now it is banning pontoons. Recently, it has been excavating the 神灘 Shentan sandbar, which will make it difficult for foreign warships to navigate. The disadvantages of the mud-filling標 have already been seen. Water management must focus on the upstream. Adjusting the flow center, narrowing the width, gathering volume, and enhancing power will cause silt to move away without excavation, and fertile land will be reclaimed without cultivation. Now, from Jiangyin to the east, to the Songkou, follow this approach to make the water flow have a track to follow, and permanently cut the south side. Then, near the 白茅沙 Baimao sandbar, we can even open the night navigation ban for the first time, and the annual cost of four or five million yuan to excavate the Shentan sandbar, which is not necessarily effective, can also be opened without dredging. The convenience for shipping and the development of the economy are immeasurable. (B) Methods: (1) In terms of technology, the regulation of the Yangtze River from Jiangyin to the Songkou is a huge project, and precise measurement should be carried out first to study the required width of this section of the Yangtze River, and the degree to which the water force should be increased to wash away the Shentan sandbar, so as not to obstruct navigation. It is proposed to ask the government to instruct the Yangtze River competent authorities to study in detail, design carefully, and formulate a whole plan and budget for implementation. (2) In terms of funding, (1) follow the precedent of the 沾𤀹</p>
<p>The dredging tax has already been established as a precedent, and the customs will collect the dredging tax; (2) transfer the special funds for the dredging of the Shentan sandbar by the Dredging Bureau to expand the scope and engage in fundamental regulation; (3) the newly formed sand fields along the river should be commuted by the government; (4) one-third of the total allocation of the Geng indemnity should be allocated to water conservancy, and a portion should be allocated to offset the cost, following the example of guiding the Huai River and regulating the Yellow River.</p>

<p>Two Robberies in Xiangcheng Township: More than a dozen bandits arrived at the 陶家村 Taojia Village in 蔃善 Xiangshan Township outside Qimen the other day and robbed Xu Anbo's family, losing about 300 yuan. They then went to Jiang Zhongru's house in 蔃無 Xiangwu Village and looted it, with a huge loss. The bandits then fled towards Yangcheng Lake.</p>
<p>Middle School Student Returns After Disappearance: Lu Yihe, a first-year junior high school student at the County Middle School in Canglangting, is 14 years old and lives at No. 5 西善長 Xishan Chang in this city. His father's name is Yi Han, and he is currently the tax section chief of the Shandong Stamp Special Tax Bureau. On the morning of the 8th, he disappeared suddenly after going to school with his brother Yiming (also studying at the school). After many inquiries by his family, there was no news. When a candy vendor Xiao Houqing in front of the school gate demanded payment of debts, they reported to the Public Security Bureau to summon Xiao for questioning, but there was no sign. Until the morning of yesterday (the 13th), Yihe suddenly returned home. According to him, he met Xiao Junqing and a gray-uniformed man on the way that day, and felt dazed after being slapped on the head by the man. He was then taken into the bottom of a boat by these people, and the boat set sail. On the 12th, he accidentally hit open the flat table board while stretching, and was delighted that the boat people were unprepared, so he hurriedly escaped ashore. He knew he was in Wuxi, so he went to the local public security branch, and a Zhang-surnamed patrolman bought him a train ticket back to Suzhou. After the family reported to the Public Security Bureau here, they have detained Xiao for strict interrogation.</p>

<p>Fire in Caitang Lane, Beitang: Qin Cainan, a resident of Caitang Lane, Beitang, outside the North Gate of Wuxi, works in a foreign firm in Shanghai and has saved a considerable sum. Yesterday morning (the 13th), at around 1:00 AM, a fire broke out due to negligence. Thick smoke billowed, and flames shot out in all directions, making it impossible to approach. Soon, the fire broke through the roof. The Qin family, comprising over ten men, women, and children, were all asleep. Hearing the fire alarm, they quickly put on their clothes, got out of bed, and rushed to the roof to escape, thus avoiding disaster. Fire brigades from various sections rushed to the scene with fire engines and made every effort to extinguish the blaze. After more than an hour, the fire gradually died down. However, all two buildings with three sections were burned down. The total estimated loss amounted to over 20,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Pawnshop Employee Flees with Stolen Jewelry: Li Erguan's son, Shusheng, also known as Xingbao, a resident of Henan Street, Zhangjing Bridge Town, Seventh District (Huai Shang City), has been working at the Tongji Pawnshop in Yanjia Bridge, Eighth District (Huai Xia City), for more than twenty years. Recently, Li Shusheng suddenly changed his behavior and secretly transported out of the vault, gold and silver jewelry, more than six hundred items, valued at thousands of yuan in pawn value and over ten thousand yuan in market value. On the 10th of this month, Shusheng asked Manager Jia of the pawnshop for leave under a pretext. The manager gave him ten yuan for travel expenses. That day, around 1:00 AM, Shusheng hired a barge owned by Aju and sailed to the city. Around 6:00 AM the next morning, Shusheng told the boatman Aju that he had important business today and would take the early bus to Changzhou to visit friends, and then went ashore. However, the pawnshop initially was unaware. It was not until the day before yesterday, when they were putting away the pawned gold jewelry, that they suddenly found the safe empty. The pawnshop manager suspected that Shusheng's leave was suspicious and immediately sent someone to Li's house to question him, but Shusheng had already fled and his whereabouts were unknown. They are currently searching for him everywhere, but it is not yet known whether the case can be solved.</p>
<p>Impersonating Public Officials to Rob Guests at Hanzhuang Brothel: A man from Jiangbei named Ma Changgui (around 50 years old) owns the Yongsheng Button Factory in Suzhou. He brought 2,900 yuan to Wuxi the day before yesterday (funds for purchasing buttons on behalf of the Shanghai Showa Foreign Firm). At 11:00 AM, he went to a brothel outside the Guangfu Gate to engage in prostitution. The brothel madam hired a prostitute named Qiaoxian to spend the night with him. Around 1:00 AM the next morning, Cheng Shaohong, Wei Fei, Jin, Gu Daichi, Shao Qisheng, and four other new actors from the Anle Grand Theater suddenly arrived, claiming to be officers from the Public Security Bureau sent to inspect. They then searched Ma Changgui and found 1,000 yuan in cash in his pocket. They then took the money and fled. The brothel owner, Pan Hongshi, immediately reported it to the nearby Second Branch of the Public Security Bureau. Director Sun dispatched patrol leader Gu Liewu and police officers to pursue them. They apprehended Cheng Shaohong and the other four near the Guangfu Bridge and recovered the stolen 1,000 yuan in cash. They were taken to the bureau and transferred to the County Public Security Bureau. Wang Zhonghu, the chief of the Judicial Section, held a trial and ordered Ma Changgui and Pan Hongbao to be released on bail, while Cheng Shaohong, Wei Fei, Jin, Gu Daichi, and Shao Qisheng were detained. Yesterday, they prepared a document to transfer them to the County Court for further investigation.</p>
<p>Young Woman Commits Suicide Due to Prolonged Illness: Lu Asheng, a native of Ningbo, worked as a coppersmith. Several years ago, he became involved with a woman from his hometown named Wang Jinmei (29 years old), and they lived together as if they were husband and wife. Asheng then opened the Yanshengxiang Copper and Tinware Shop next to the Postal Bureau on Hanchang Road outside the Guangfu Gate. Later, Jinmei gave birth to a daughter (now five years old). Unexpectedly, after giving birth, she contracted pulmonary tuberculosis. Although Asheng hired doctors for treatment, it was ineffective. She was confined to bed all day and turned to opium, indulging in smoking to alleviate her illness. Recently, Asheng, seeing that Jinmei's illness was terminal, found a young woman from Henglin as a replacement wife and built a separate house for her. When Jinmei found out about this, she was deeply dissatisfied and contemplated suicide. On the evening of the 7th of this month, she secretly took four red pills in an attempt to end her life. Fortunately, her partner noticed and rushed her to the Tongren Hospital for treatment, saving her life. The day before yesterday, Jinmei took advantage of the lack of attention, found a pair of sharp scissors in the room, and stabbed her throat several times. Blood gushed out, and she collapsed to the ground, barely breathing and unconscious. Lu Asheng found out about this and immediately sent her to the Brothers Hospital for treatment. However, due to excessive blood loss, the treatment was ineffective. She passed away yesterday morning around 10:00 AM.</p>

<p>Elderly Farmer Commits Suicide Due to Economic Pressure: Chen Shengsheng, a farmer from Xiaoliantang, Tu 92, Heyang Township, Pucheng District, is over fifty years old and has two sons, Tongtong and Chaosi. His family is poor, and Shengsheng often finds it difficult to make ends meet, leading to accumulating debts. Recently, Shengsheng has become older and more frail, deaf and visually impaired, and can no longer work in the fields. As a result, his income has decreased, and creditors have been pressing him for repayment. The day before yesterday, Shengsheng discussed coping strategies with his two sons. Unexpectedly, not only did his sons have no solutions, but they also berated their father. Shengsheng was further angered and quietly went to the kitchen, grabbed a kitchen knife, slashed his throat, and collapsed. When his family heard the noise and went to check, they found him lying in a pool of blood, barely breathing, with the kitchen knife still in his hand. Township Chief Qian Ju'an heard about this and rushed to investigate, reporting it to the Sixth Police Station in charge, who dispatched police to hire a doctor for treatment. However, due to excessive blood loss and damage to the throat, he could not be saved and soon died. Tu, the patrol officer from the official police station, considering it a matter of life and death, intended to report it to the county for examination. However, Chen Tongtong and other sons requested the station to waive the examination and declared that their father committed suicide due to economic pressure and that they would handle the burial themselves.</p>
<p>Over Ten Families Robbed in One Night: Four bandit boats, carrying about fifty to sixty bandits, suddenly arrived at the Xiaojiayang area of Hengtang District on the evening of the 11th. After landing, they entered Zhang Senbao's house with weapons and robbed him of over two hundred yuan. Then, they went to Ni Quanbao's teahouse and robbed him of clothes and silver dollars worth about a hundred yuan. They then went to Zhang Xiaowu and Zhang Anan's houses and robbed them of over five hundred yuan. After robbing four families, they went to Gaojiazhai (about two mornings away from Xiaojia) and robbed Wang Er, Wang Xing, Wang Quanquan, and three other families. The total losses were estimated at over three hundred yuan. Then, they went to Qiangwu (names unknown) to rob. Finally, they robbed Tang Jinshan, Tan Kangbo, Tan Bo'an, and other families in Waitang. The villagers heard about it and reported it to Township Chief Cao Xuchu.

<p>Bandit Leader Chen Lin and Others Escorted from Hangzhou to Zhenjiang: Chen Lin (also known as Chen Wenqi), Shou'er, Labajinbiao, and other bandit leaders led a large group of bandits in July of last year (lunar calendar) in Shanghui Village, Xiaohui Village, Yuantou Village, Xue Village, and other places outside the South Gate of Zhenjiang, killing, robbing, and burning hundreds of civilian houses, and kidnapping several hostages. After a thorough search by the authorities, they fled to Hangzhou and hid in the Lunzhou Hotel in the New Market of Hangzhou. A few days ago, Huang Hongnian and others from Zhenjiang who were living in Hangzhou learned of their whereabouts and reported it to the Zhejiang Provincial Guild Public Security Bureau Detective Team, which apprehended the bandits Chen Wenqi and two others. After interrogation, they confessed that they had been commissioned by Yan Xishan in July of last year to gather hundreds of people in the western countryside of Zhenjiang to create disturbances in the rear. The team then placed the bandit leaders under strict guard and sent a letter to the Zhenjiang County Government, requesting them to send someone to take over and escort them. After Zhang, the county magistrate, approved the letter, he sent the deputy leader of the county police team, Zhen Kui, to Hangzhou with a police team to receive the three bandits yesterday and escort them to Zhenjiang.

<p>Provincial Education Department Sends Personnel to Yangzhou for Inspection: The Jiangsu Education Department believes that there have been many disputes in Jiangdu education in the past, mostly due to economic reasons. It has ordered the county to cooperate with the Education Bureau to organize an Education Fund Management Committee and issue bonds to fundamentally eliminate arrears and avoid panic. The Management Committee has now been established, and bond sales have begun. If there are no other obstacles or changes, all arrears owed to teachers and staff will be cleared by the end of this academic year. However, Director Chen still has many revolutionary matters regarding Jiangdu education. Therefore, yesterday (the 13th), he specially sent Yang Ziting, a staff member of the Fifth Section, to Yangzhou to inspect everything. It is said that he will first plan from the administrative aspect, and then inspect various schools and community school organizations.</p>

<p>Commits Suicide by Poisoning After Unable to Recover Debt: Wu Kunlong, a worker in the Yangzhong County Party Department, was naturally timid. Through years of hard work, he had saved a little money. Ji Zhiy, a neighbor who ran a sesame seed cake shop, coveted his wealth and pretended to be friendly, tricking him into depositing 180 yuan of his savings in the shop. In February of this year, Wu Kunlong quarreled with Ji Zhiy over his inability to withdraw his deposit. Tang Jisheng, a member of the Party Committee, Liu Yulin, the principal of Sanmao Elementary School, and Zhu Jinzhang and other neighbors mediated, and Ji Zhiy transferred two mu of land to Wu Kunlong for management, with a written agreement, and the matter was resolved. Afterwards, the relationship between the two men was erratic, with occasional visits and inquiries, but quarrels and disputes were almost daily occurrences, leaving everyone baffled. On the evening of the 9th, Wu Kunlong argued with Ji Zhiy again because he could not recover the money for the flour he had purchased. On the morning of the 10th, Ji instigated his wife to rush to the entrance of the Party Department, grab Wu Kunlong, and curse and scold him on the ground. The First Public Security Branch sent police to arrest both parties and released them on bail shortly after. Wu Kunlong, feeling humiliated and resentful after being unable to recover his debt and being insulted, contemplated suicide. He secretly went to a smoking den and purchased one yuan of raw opium, sitting in the sesame seed cake shop. In the evening, the poison took effect, and his face turned pale. The shop owner, Ji Zhiy, and his wife, seeing that they had caused trouble, took the opportunity to escape. Neighbors hired a doctor to treat him, but the poisoning was too deep, and the treatment was ineffective. He died around 11:00 PM that night. The landlord, surnamed Zhu, fearing being implicated, reported it to the Public Security Branch, which sent police to the countryside and arrested the culprit, Ji Zhiy, in a small widow's house near Shisiwei and sent him to the county government for detention. It is reported that on the 12th, the news was transmitted to the family of the deceased, who sent personnel to examine the body. The Party Department has sent a letter to the county government requesting that it be handled according to law.</p>

<p>The Coastal Protection and Bandit Suppression Process in Jiangsu Province: In March, the Jiangsu Provincial Government convened a provincial conference on the protection of the fishing industry. Representatives of the fishing industry along the coast of northern Jiangsu described the brutal situation of the sea bandits. The provincial government, together with the Provincial Pacification Supervisor and the National Coast Guard Department of the Navy Department, handled the protection of the fishing industry and bandit suppression. Because bandit spies were densely distributed in various parts of northern Jiangsu, they secretly discussed a plan of action in the province, Shanghai and other places. On the one hand, the province ordered the county government to find ten pilots from Lusi to Doulonggang in Yancheng, hire more than thirty sea boats, and establish a temporary office for coastal protection of Jiangsu along the coast of Tongcheng. Ding Zhennan, director of the Coast Guard Department, was appointed as director, and Zhang Han, director of the Wusong Water Police District, and Pan Taowan, head of the 282nd Regiment, were appointed as deputy directors. Seven radio stations were set up along the coast. Once the deployment was completed, Directors Zhang and Pan led military police ships to Lusi to suppress the bandits. There were more than forty patrol boats and warships. The bandit ships were approximately thirty. The bandits only paid attention to the military police in the south. They did not expect the interception in the north. Many people were killed and injured. Outside Huanhai Port, a bandit ship was captured. There were only eight bandit corpses and three guns on board. Many other bandit ships were destroyed by artillery fire. More than twenty fishing boats and eighty crew members that were kidnapped by the bandits have all escaped and returned. The Tonghai, Ruyang and Qi oceans have been completely pacified. Among the bandits, Shen Fengshan, a force of 500 men, surrendered to the government troops. With the approval of the provincial government, the Security Department reorganized them into the Jiangsu Maritime Guerrilla Force. This team, assisted by artillery sent by the military police, was extremely effective in the suppression. Many people died in the Battle of Juegang. The remaining three hundred or so have reached Dongtai Pincha and are joining forces with the Huaibei Maritime Police Guerrilla Force to pursue the fleeing bandits to the north.</p>

<p>Son Arrests Father for Adultery, Requests Clan Chief to Decide: Chen Ensheng, from Chen Gongling, Fenghua, inherited a large amount of ancestral property. Later, because Ensheng indulged in evil habits and gambling, he spent a lot of money, leading to the decline of his family. At first, he pawned clothes and jewelry, then sold fields and houses. His son, Zenghe, initially endured it, then complained. Recently, a major conflict broke out. His father, Ensheng, hating his son for being unfilial, discussed with his mistress, Chen Yinge, planning to send Zenghe to the authorities for investigation. However, his son found out about it.

<p>Lieshan Labor Strike to Be Resolved Soon: The Lieshan Coal Mine in Su County experienced twists and turns when Li Battalion of the 39th Regiment of the 7th Division stationed in Suixi arrested bandits, which triggered a strike by all coal mine workers. Details were reported in previous newspapers. It is now learned that after Lu Zidong, the general manager of the mine, arrived in Xuzhou, he originally intended to meet with Division Commander Wang Jun face-to-face to negotiate. Because Wang went to Beijing, his chief of staff met with him instead. Lu reported the course of events and requested that he be instructed to quickly release Xu Ziqin, the supervisor of the mine workers, and the thirty or so workers who had been arrested, in order to resume work and avoid long-term losses to the mine. Wang's chief of staff agreed to instruct Li Battalion to release them as soon as possible to resume work. Lu then went to Lieshan to inspect. According to current observations, the Lieshan incident can be resolved peacefully within a few days. Once the workers are released and the mine resumes work, Lu Zidong will return to Bengbu.</p>

<p>—Lost to Pharmacy School 19 to 20—Defeated Kansai 30 to 10</p>
<p>Unfortunately Lost to Pharmacy School</p>
<p>(Osaka Communication, 7th) The Liangjiang Girls' School basketball team arrived in Osaka at noon on the 6th. The players were extremely exhausted due to the long journey. They originally planned to rest for a while before competing with various teams, but the Osaka and Kansai Basketball Associations had already scheduled the matches and could not reschedule. The Liangjiang players had no choice but to do their best, even playing while feeling unwell, regardless of the outcome. Thus, they played against the Imperial Pharmacy School team at the YMCA field at 5:30 PM on the 7th. Mr. Isawa and Mr. Sawada served as referees. Liangjiang performed well in the first quarter, but their strength declined, and their performance did not improve. Repeated fouls were also a contributing factor. Seeing an opportunity, the Pharmacy School team pushed forward and scored more points in the second and third quarters. The fourth quarter was a tie. As a result, Liangjiang lost by a score of 20 to 19. Osaka newspapers reported on the game the next day, saying that it was a "glorious defeat." In terms of skill, Liangjiang performed admirably, but they were ultimately unable to win due to fatigue. The score sheet is as follows:</p>
<p>Liangjiang Team　　Position　Fouls　Points</p>
<p>Shao Jinying　Right Forward　1　9</p>
<p>Yang Ren　Left Forward　1　2</p>

<p>Great Victory Against the Kansai Championship Team</p>
<p>(Osaka Communication, 8th) The Liangjiang Girls' School basketball team played against the Kansai Women's Basketball Club at 5:10 PM on the 8th. This team is the Kansai Championship Team, dominant in Osaka, and invincible. After losing to the Pharmacy School team by one point yesterday, the Liangjiang players were filled with anger and determined to overcome the strong opponent and avenge their defeat. The overseas Chinese community was highly expectant. Tian Shenhua and Ting organized a cheerleading squad of over 40 people to cheer on the team, creating a tense atmosphere. The referee was Xiaojie Dangguo. After the game began, the two sides were evenly matched. In the first quarter, the score was 10 to 8. From the second quarter onwards, Liangjiang advanced on both offense and defense, leaving the opponent defenseless. Shao Jinying scored several consecutive points, and the Kansai team was unable to make progress, resulting in a shutout. The score at the end of the first half was 18 to 8. In the third and fourth quarters, Liangjiang scored 12 more points. The final score was 30 to 10. Liangjiang won by a large margin, setting a new record. Shao Jinying stood out the most in this game, scoring 18 points. She used her brilliant strategy and ran back and forth as if she were in an uninhabited place, earning praise from the audience. The other players also displayed great teamwork. It was truly a remarkable achievement to perform so well overseas. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>Liangjiang Team　　Position　Fouls　Points</p>
<p>Shao Jinying　Right Forward　1　18</p>

<p>As the reporter writes this, the Liangjiang team has received urgent telegrams from Kyoto and Nara, urging them to come and compete. They have decided to depart at 9:00 AM today (the 9th). Today is National Humiliation Day. Reflecting on the past fills us with emotion. Each player has vowed to win, perhaps as a way to serve the country.</p>

<p>—Jielu</p>
<p>While reading Linghua Jun's travelogue of India in "Free Talk," Daojie Fashi is often mentioned. This reminds me of his master, the Eight-Fingered Ascetic, which shows that there are many eminent monks in Buddhism. The ascetic's Dharma name is Jing'an, and he calls himself Jichan. He was from Hunan. He lost his parents at a young age and became a monk at a temple in Hengshan due to poverty. He was assigned to the task of feeding the cats and dogs. One day, he saw peach blossoms falling from the fence, covering the stream with red petals, and suddenly had an epiphany. He then burned two fingers in front of the Buddha. Unknowingly, his wisdom greatly increased. He visited Yueyang Tower and saw the vast expanse of Dongting Lake, and spontaneously recited, "Dongting waves send a monk here." From then on, his literary talent flourished, and his writing was elegant and refined. Scholars were surprised, thinking that Jia Dao had been reborn. Fan Fanshan, Yi Ku'an, Chen San'yuan, and others frequently composed and sang poetry with him. While living at Tiantong Temple in Siming, he also frequently composed poems with local elders Sheng Shengchuan and Chen Tianying. The Eight-Fingered Ascetic's Poetry Collection, which he published, is said to rival the Tang Dynasty poems. The Master was a burly man with a booming voice. His study of Buddhism seems less profound than Dixian of the Tiantai school or as novel as Taixu, but the Ascetic was forthright and honest, and he was deeply patriotic and righteous. He did not discuss Buddhist doctrine, but he was deeply aligned with Buddhist principles. Observing his founding of the Buddhist Association and monastic schools, his achievements were remarkable. How can we simply label him a "poet monk"? During the time when Yuan Shikai was in power, the Ascetic went to Yandu to have the Buddhist Association registered but was ridiculed by a section chief. He was very angry and passed away that evening at an inn. His disciple Daojie, the abbot of Fayuan Temple, managed his funeral and buried him in his prepared tomb at Tiantong in Siming. Plum blossoms were planted all around the tomb. It is what the Master's poem called "Transmit the mind with a bright moon, bury the bones among ten thousand plum blossoms." Now, I will record several of the Master's poems below. Bao Xie, the attendant, sent me a poem from his friend Li Shangshan Qun, mourning his female disciple Hua Yuezhen. I wrote two quatrains after it: "On the shore of Moon Lake is a house, a fifteen-year-old girl's temples are just beginning to darken. Not allowing red dust to contaminate jade bones, the wild wind blows down white lotus flowers." "Purple orchid fragrance cleanses the heavy door, recognizing the exiled soul from the heavens. Do not sing mournfully by the lake, fleeting flowers in a mirror, the moon in the water, casually leaving traces." I wrote on the poetry scroll of the Korean Kim Duitang, collected by Wang Wusheng, the director: "Wanting to sing collecting ferns in the Western Mountains, white clouds' thoughts are contrary to the times. Who will take the lonely tears of a subject from the East Sea and blow them onto the old robes of the Southern Dynasties?" "What is the regret for the country being destroyed and the body remaining? Pitying the bronze camel in the thorns. The surrendered king loves the concubines of the Wei Palace, the brave warrior sadly sings the song of the Yishui." One day after the Double Ninth Festival, I sent a message from Jinling to Wei Xuezhuo in Taihu: "Again as a visitor to Jiangnan, sadly recalling old travels. Light frost on the leaves of Dongting, the setting sun on the autumn of Moling. Asking about the Double Ninth Festival, where to climb high? A man in white should send wine, did you insert chrysanthemums?" Poetry and lyrics are the wisdom of people. The Master, with only a slight knowledge of letters, achieved so much. The Buddhist theory of the six supernatural powers is indeed not false.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Huating Cranes <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>—Gu Zhizhou</p>
<p>When reading the History of Jin, Lu Ji sighed when he was executed, "Will I ever hear the cranes of Huating again?" This shows that cranes from Huating County have been known since ancient times. The species still exists today. In the territory of the county, by the slopes and watersides, with scarlet crowns and white feathers, long necks and slender legs, they can often be seen, like lofty hermits visiting the stream and seeking scenic spots. They are smaller in shape than the ordinary cranes we see. Their tails and wings have no mixed feathers, and their entire bodies are pure white. The most amazing thing is that they never fly out of Huating, so they are rarely seen elsewhere. Their nests are often built on the large trees in front of the county government. They are quite docile in nature. Except for foraging for food, they often curl one leg up and close both eyes, perched on the top of the tree. Even if children shout and disturb them below, they remain with their eyes closed and legs curled. Or if someone throws a brick at them, and it does not hit them, they simply open their eyes and glance down. Their quietness and composure, unwilling to be disturbed, is such. It is truly a model for us. However, because of this, they are often harmed by archers. Although the authorities have repeatedly prohibited this, it is evident that the archers do as they please, and the orders are not followed. I have heard that Westerners not only preserve and study ancient artifacts, but they also raise and protect rare species of birds and animals, so that they may be preserved permanently. I am deeply afraid that the cranes of Huating will become extinct within a few decades, like the unicorns and phoenixes, leaving only beautiful names in the world.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Mourning Master Mei Ju <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>—Wu Jiren</p>
<p>Master Wang Mei Ju of Guangdong was nearly seventy years old, open-minded, and possessed the talent to save the world. Sadly, he was stuck in the literary world and not used by the world. In his prime, he was a law official, known for his integrity. In recent years, he resided in Shanghai, tutoring the two sons of Mr. Du Meishu. My friend, Cai Jun Bomin, had three generations of friendship with the Master. He thought I was a poor writer with a meager income and nowhere to learn. He introduced me to the Master. After that, every time I visited, I would ask for advice. Although the Master was old, he was vigorous in spirit and explained in great detail without tiring. Every time he wrote an essay, in addition to making revisions, he would write another one for me to consult. However, due to my job at the Mingxing Film Company, which kept me busy, I was unable to follow him day and night. I only studied diligently for three months. Thinking of it now, I am filled with endless sorrow.</p>
<p>I was later dismissed from the company because of a disagreement with Director Song. The Master often expressed his regret and encouraged me, saying, "Be harmonious in life and upright in conduct. Do not be arrogant, and strive to maintain your personal integrity." I received his kind words and engraved them in my heart. For more than a year after leaving the Master, I was constantly thinking of him. In March of this year, I rejoined Mingxing, but I was too busy with writing to visit him. On the first day of April, I received his address from Mr. Shou Juan and went to visit him. The Master had just recovered from an illness but was still energetic and unchanged from before. We talked for two hours, and he asked me in detail about my situation after we parted. The Master once said, "Now that you have a home, you should work hard and not waste time." When he learned that I was addicted to raising goldfish, he told me to bring a few when I returned home because he had also raised them in his youth. I remember that he had an article on goldfish raising published in a certain newspaper.</p>
<p>The Master liked to drink, but he never refused or got drunk. In recent years, his illness recurred, and his liver energy rose frequently. He began to abstain from alcohol. I was planning to choose a day to prepare wine and food and have a good drink with the Master, but unexpectedly, the sad news came that he had been summoned to heaven. Recalling the depth of love we had shared over the years, I could not help but burst into tears. I write this to express my grief.</p>

<p>—Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>I have been so busy with personal affairs that I have not been able to visit Wumen for several years. Recently, colleagues from the company went to Suzhou to shoot outdoor scenes for the play "Ginseng Fruit," so I went with them. Unexpectedly, the weather was not good. As soon as we arrived in Suzhou, it started raining. I was extremely bored sitting in the hotel, so I drove into the city with Du Yu Jun to visit Canglang Pavilion. The waterside pavilions and winding corridors, with jagged piled stones, were greatly appreciated by Du Yu. The beauty of Canglang Pavilion lies in its appearance. Entering the pavilion, I found the scenery to be ordinary and lacked charm. If Su Shunqin knew, he would probably agree with me. There is a fine arts school inside, headed by my schoolmate</p>

<p>People in the South primarily eat rice. Although they also occasionally consume wheat products, their choices are limited to noodles and pastries. However, people in the North have a much wider variety of wheat-based foods. These days, it is the time when "the wheat fields send a breeze carrying the fragrance of cakes and pastries." I will introduce some Yuan wheat products that are most interesting in our Jiangbei region.</p>
<p>Fragrant Green Wheat: Use green Yuan wheat that has matured but not yet withered and yellowed. Roast it in a pot until cooked. It's delicious.</p>
<p>Cold Needles: Lightly stir-fry green Yuan wheat in a pot. Then, grind it with a millstone. This will produce soft, long, needle-like strands. The taste is fresh and pleasant.</p>
<p>Cold Needle Pancakes: Sun-dry the cold needles and store them. You can mix them with flour and large shrimp to make pancakes. They have a unique flavor.</p>
<p>Wheat Flake Congee: Grind the matured wheat into fine flakes. Use them to cook congee with rice. This not only saves firewood but is also very healthy.</p>
<p>Coarse Wheat Rice: Grind Yuan wheat into coarse flakes. It can be cooked with rice. Eating this kind of rice in summer is very cool and refreshing.</p>

<p>— Huang Yanpei</p>
<p>On the 20th, we arrived in Qingdao and stopped for four hours. We visited the old German artillery battery, Qingdao University, and the observatory.</p>
<p>The Qingdao University campus was formerly the Bismarck Barracks. It opened last year with two colleges: Liberal Arts and Sciences. The College of Liberal Arts is divided into three departments: Chinese Philosophy, Foreign Philosophy, and Education. The College of Science is divided into four departments: Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. There are over a hundred students and thirty faculty members. The annual budget actually received is 360,000 yuan allocated by the province and 48,000 yuan allocated by the Jiaoji Railway, totaling 408,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The Qingdao Observatory was built by the Germans and later occupied by the Japanese. It was taken over by the Republic of China in 1922. It currently has departments of Meteorology, Seismology, Astronomy, Magnetism, and Oceanography. It sends out weather maps daily. During the Japanese occupation, it was limited to Japanese ships and used Japanese language. Now, it is available to both Chinese and foreign ships. It has a shortwave radio station for receiving and transmitting weather telegrams. Ships near the coast can directly inquire about storms, etc., and receive replies. For the past three years, it has used an electric time signal instead of a noon gun, three times a day, which is quite accurate. New domes and equatorial rooms have been built, and large telescopes and solar and lunar photography equipment have been purchased. The China Education and Culture Foundation Board of Directors has provided a special grant of 25,000 yuan to purchase equatorial and meridian instruments to train meteorological talent. The director, Jiang Bingran, has been in this position since the takeover and is very diligent. He publishes various charts, annual reports, monthly reports, and other publications, totaling dozens. However, the monthly expenses are only 3,000 yuan, which are paid by the municipal government.</p>
<p>This observatory is still a pending case between China and Japan. When it was taken over in 1922, Japan refused to relinquish its maritime academic rights in East Asia, claiming that China had no specialized personnel in this field and refused to return it. After negotiations, it was stipulated that China would send a director and trainees, but Japanese staff would continue to work and would not receive Chinese compensation. After the technicians were trained, they would be handed over to the Japanese staff. It was also agreed to establish free communication methods with various places in Japan. In reality, China was not lacking in such technicians. Later, the Japanese staff submitted a written opinion stating that China already had such technicians and that it should be completely returned. However, negotiations have stalled due to various prevarications by the Japanese side.</p>

<h3 id="e119">Hawthorne's Detective Turn (13) <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>The question raised by Hawthorne was indeed very important. However, the situation behind the scenes was very complicated, and a proper conclusion could not be reached immediately. After more than ten minutes of consideration, we assumed three possible causes: besides theft and pranks, as Hawthorne had suggested, we also assumed an ideal of revenge. Hawthorne said, "This person's plan is very meticulous and very insidious. It is definitely not the kind of prank that ordinary friends would play. Imagine, at that time, if my old friend Bao Lang had taken another step forward, wouldn't his life have been in danger?" Zhang Baoquan nodded and said, "Yes, this matter was indeed extremely dangerous. What is most hateful is that Qiu Kui is really too stupid and useless." Hawthorne said, "If this detective's actions were truly out of stupidity, that would be excusable. Otherwise, I cannot help but suspect that he is in collusion." Zhang Baoquan quickly said, "This is definitely not the case. I can guarantee it. Tonight, I passed by the Gao family's door and saw that there were many carriages and horses outside, so I guessed that there were many guests. Therefore, in addition to following Gao Peixian's request to send four police officers to take care of things, I also sent Qiu Kui to guard in secret, to prevent any accidents. But I didn't expect him to make such a big mistake. But I decided to send him only at dusk, so collusion in advance is impossible." Hawthorne lowered his head and flicked some ash from his fingers, without answering immediately. I then interjected, "If Mr. Zhang can guarantee that he is not in collusion, that would be best. But it would be better for him to make some demonstration, so that we can trust him." Zhang Baoquan said, "How should he demonstrate? Please tell me, Mr. Bao, and I will definitely make him follow your instructions." I said, "Since the villain was let go by him at the time, he should be responsible for tracking him down and bringing him back. I think that within three days, he should hand that person over to us, or at least find out his whereabouts." Zhang Baoquan nodded repeatedly and said, "Good, good. This is not only his responsibility, but also my duty, and I should be equally responsible." Although Hawthorne did not participate in this suggestion, he clearly agreed with it. He stood up and wrapped the collar on the desk with the white cloth again. He said, "Brother Baoquan, since that's the case, let's proceed separately. I will keep this thing for now. You can agree to that, right?"</p>

<h3 id="e120">Financial Gold Market Extremely Quiet <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Very Desolate with a Slight Softness: Yesterday, the 13th, the gold price was extremely stable, with a slight downward trend, fluctuating only within one or two taels. The total market difference was no more than four taels. Traders were cautious, so there were few transactions, mainly because the expiration date was approaching. As for the silver market, prices had generally risen, so the opening was low. Afterwards, there were some ups and downs, and the foreign exchange was slightly loose, with prices as before. The cash transactions of various firms were slightly different, with prices hovering around 745 taels. By the afternoon, it became even more dull due to Wednesday's lack of activity in the foreign exchange market, so prices often remained within 46 taels.</p>
<p>Low Opening and Immediate Quietness: The June opening fell 2.9 qian to 743.8 taels, with a large spread of 1/16. The public and private telegrams for silver prices both rose by 1/4, causing a downward trend. Afterwards, the Dalian gang and others bought in, pushing the price up to 45 taels. However, Fuyu, Yuanchun, Hengyu, and others sold, bringing it down to 43 taels. The exchange rate was flat. Korea initially entered Dalian at 1.59375 taels per won, and Zhengjin entered at 1.5925 taels per won. The pound could be settled at 1.33125. Afterwards, Yuancheng and items entered, further raising it by 3 taels. The shilling remained unchanged, with Donghui adding 0.25, reaching 45.9 qian. The domestic market was stable. Zhengjin bought spot Dalian at 1.5925 taels per won. However, there seemed to be more sellers on the trading floor, so it retreated to 44.78 qian. Changsheng, Yongqian, Changxiang, Yongfeng, and others chased purchases, reaching 46.5 qian at 10 o'clock. At this time, China Bank had made a deal for August pounds at 1.325 to 1.33125. Shortly afterwards, Qianchangxiang and Taichang and others sold, and American and Japanese banks sold July pounds at 3.125, so it retreated to 45.1 qian. In an instant, buyers became active. Zhifeng, Yongda, Xingyong, Hengyu, and others all entered, and Mitsui absorbed Dalian at 1.595 taels per won, immediately pulling it up by 2 taels, reaching 47 taels after 10:30. Afterwards, Tianyu Yong and others sold, reaching 4 taels 67 qian after 11:10. The Dalian gang and Chunyuanyong and others pulled in, so it rose by more than 1 tael again. Mitsui also absorbed July US dollars at 31 yuan, reaching 6.3 qian after 11:30, then suppressing it again to 5.23 qian, as retail investors unloaded, but Tong Taichang and others bought in, totaling 46 taels. The noon closing was 45.8 qian, and the posted price was changed to 784.1 taels, a difference of 38-39 taels.</p>
<p>Extremely Boring, Early Closing: The afternoon opening was 45.8 qian, continuing to 5.5 qian, then rising to 46 taels, but transactions were minimal. At 2:30, Tianyu Yong and Tong Taichang and others came to sell, resulting in a drop of 8-9 qian, reaching 45.1 qian after 2:50. The trading floor was extremely quiet, but the market order was chaotic again. Some active members of the industry kicked shoes at each other as a ball game, causing a lot of noise, so the market closed at 3:00, closing at 45.5 qian, but without dispersing, it rushed up 4-5 qian again, so items made a large profit of 4 qian, compared to the day before (according to the posted price), recovering a drop of 1.2 taels, a reversal after many days of rising. The final maximum price was 47 taels, the minimum price was 43 taels, a difference of 4 taels. The early morning price of items was 4.2 qian, the noon closing was 5.6 qian, the afternoon was 6 qian, and the closing price was 5.9 qian. The posted price was reduced by a small 38-39 taels. The registered price was 46 taels, and the water subsidy was 44 taels, the same in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Expiration Approaching, No Intention to Trade: The transaction numbers of various firms are as follows: Zhifeng Yong, Yuancheng, Changsheng Yong, Juchang, and Shunli all bought in. Hengyu, Yuanheng, Wanxing, Tong Taichang, Yongfeng, Futaiheng, Dadecheng, etc., had fluctuating ins and outs. Tianyu Yong, Shunmao, Yuancheng Yong, Yuantai, and Yuanmao Yong all sold. In the afternoon, Yuanmao Yong, Yuanda Yong, Hengchang Yong, and Hengyu occasionally had ins and outs, with a small number. Zhifeng Yong bought in. Tianyu Yong, Tong Taichang, and Yuankangxiang all sold. The item slips also had only a few ins and outs. The Dalian gang had a total of 800 transactions, with balanced ins and outs. The Guang gang had no transactions, it is said.</p>

<p>Although Posted Prices Shrank…Domestic Prices Rose Instead</p>
<p>Yesterday, the British and American gold markets both reported rises, but the market was calm. Almost all of HSBC's posted exchange rates, except for Hong Kong, which added 0.125, totaling 78.875 taels, and Japanese gold, which added 0.25, totaling 1.6275 taels, remained unchanged. As for domestic British, American, and Japanese exchange rates, there was a loosening trend, but no special changes. Because the gold market was very mediocre, the result was a slight loss of 1 tael. The noon closing was higher compared to the day before, with British gold rising by 0.0625, American gold also adding 0.0625, and Japanese gold falling by 0.25, which is a situation of ostensibly increasing but actually decreasing. In the afternoon, because it was Wednesday, there was usually no market. Gold companies slightly settled British gold, and banks such as HSBC, Citibank, Taiwan, and Anda sold off, with transactions of about 100,000 pounds. American gold had a small number of ins and outs.

It was much better, but demand was sparse, and the situation was difficult to improve significantly.

<p>Securities: Bond Prices Remain Weak</p>
<p>The Market Remains Strong, with 21.7 Million in Transactions</p>
<p>Yesterday, the spot market for public bonds remained sluggish, while the futures market was as strong as before. Morning transactions totaled over 10 million yuan, and afternoon transactions totaled over 1 million yuan. The trend was chaotic. The result was a larger drop compared to the previous day for the 19 Customs and the 19 Benevolence May contracts, with each falling by 1 yuan 3-4 jiao. Other contracts continued to fall by several jiao. Spot transactions for the day totaled 9,000 yuan, and futures transactions reached over 21.7 million yuan.

<p>Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Market Turns Bullish in the Afternoon</p>
<p>The yarn market fell in the morning and rose in the afternoon, but spot sales were more developed. Exports of Japanese yarn saw renewed activity, so the Osaka Sanpin yarn for this month was short-squeezed. The recent rise has been drastic because the underlying inventory there is scarce and shorts are panicked. Today, 500 bales of 20-count "Ren Zhong" (Human Bell) yarn were purchased at 108.5 Japanese yen, equivalent to about 178-9 taels of Gui Yuan. As a result, market sentiment was greatly shaken, and the market turned bullish. However, the American cotton situation was still weak, so selling pressure was still intense. There was too much inventory of 10-count coarse yarn, and at a time when demand was weak, many people sold on the rise. In short, most people are currently bearish, and the market is still in a state of fluctuation. A more exciting situation is needed.</p>
<p>The Human Standard Fell in the Morning and Rose in the Afternoon: The Human Standard market opened in the morning with American cotton falling again, and selling pressure causing the market to weaken again. Each contract fell by 7-8 qian, and the second and third contracts fell slightly by 5, 6, and 7 qian. In the afternoon, upon hearing that Sanpin yarn had risen and exports had resumed, the market was in great condition, and the situation was tight. Each month rose by 1 tael 5-6 qian, with transactions totaling 18,200 bales. Yi Chang sold 850 bales, Yongfeng sold 700 bales, Shen Da sold 550 bales, Rongxing sold 600 bales, and Heshen bought 950 bales, Tongyu bought 650 bales, Tianlong bought 500 bales, Hengde bought 600 bales, and Deji bought 500 bales. The closing prices are recorded on the left.</p>
<p>Human Standard Closing Prices: Rise/Fall, Account Balance, Closing Price, Rise/Fall, Account Balance. May: 16.15, Up 1.0, 58,950. August: 16.1, Up 0.6, 84,200. June: 16.14, 970,150. September: 15.73, 1,043,550. July: 16.11, 876,250. October: 15.74, 929,750.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Sales Still Active: Spot yarn sales were still smooth. It was found that all the gangs bought a total of 2,600 bales for the day, with 1,050 bales being traded among the industry. Prices were trending upwards. Among the customer gangs, 200 bales went to the mainland, 100 bales to Shantou, 720 bales to Sichuan, 1,300 bales to Hankou, 150 bales to Tianjin, 150 bales to Qingdao, 50 bales to Weihaiwei, 100 bales to the Northern gang, and 250 bales to miscellaneous gangs.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Cotton Market Initially Weakened, Then Stabilized <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market initially fell and then rose. The American cotton market was still weak, but local inventory was too scarce, and sources were drying up. Hankou merchants came to Shanghai to purchase Indian cotton, indicating a lack of arrivals. Therefore, Japanese merchants and bulls held on tightly, so it rose immediately after falling. However, spot cotton transactions were sluggish, and some retail investors shorted.</p>
<p>The Hankou Standard Rose by 1-2 Qian: The Hankou Standard market opened in the morning with American cotton falling again, and most retail investors sold short due to bearish sentiment, with each contract falling by 3, 4, and 5 qian. The second contract rose by 1-2 qian. In the afternoon, it rose by 3, 4, and 5 qian, following the yarn market. Transactions totaled 57,900 dan. Changfeng sold 4,900 dan, Yuanda sold 1,300 dan, and Dafeng sold 2,200 dan. Yicheng bought 5,200 dan, Rongxing bought 2,600 dan, Jing Ruida bought 1,400 dan, and Guangfeng bought 1,600 dan.

<p>American Cotton Continues Downward: Yesterday, the American cotton market was lackluster, with industry insiders adopting a wait-and-see approach. Later, due to positive forecasts from the West and unfavorable news from Liverpool, the market weakened. Futures prices fell by 6 to 7 points, while spot prices dropped by 5 points. British cotton futures remained unchanged, while spot prices fell by 6 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 10 points. Indian cotton was sold by Japanese traders, and the market was weak.

<p>Foreign Rice: New Order for Over 1,400 Tons</p>
<p>May-June Futures... Japanese Traders Dumped... Local Dealers Purchased</p>
<p>Yesterday, the trading of Kehsien rice remained sluggish. Keh gangs maintained their standstill, and the general market only had 167 bags of Hunan machine-processed rice at a price of 10 yuan and 85 cents, which were purchased by local dealers. There were no other transactions.</p>
<p>Foreign rice has been absent from the market for a long time. The previous order was directly shipped by the Keh gangs, so there were no transactions in the market. However, yesterday, a new order for over 1,400 tons was placed by local dealers with Japanese traders, all dumped by Mitsui &amp; Co. It includes 650 bags of No. 1 Saigon rice, to be shipped at the end of May, priced at 5 taels and 43 cents per hundred catties; and 800 tons of Small Ground rice, to be shipped in early June, priced at 5 taels and 6 cents. No. 1 Saigon rice was distributed among local dealers, while Small Ground rice was ordered by Dingfeng, Dingtai, Dafeng, Xie Daheng, Xingji, and other firms.</p>

<p>Factory Raw Silk: Telegraphic Price Fluctuations Indicate Flat or Hidden Declines</p>
<p>Yesterday, the local foreign firms' silk market was flat and weak. European and American silk factories were still slow to purchase Shanghai white factory raw silk due to the low price of Japanese silk. Although there were telegraphic price fluctuations from England and France, the exchange rate remained flat or showed hidden declines, making transactions difficult. Yesterday, only Lienar and others purchased 50 bales of Shanghai white factory raw silk, and Qianli purchased 50 bales of white dried raw silk. Prices did not increase.</p>

<p>The silkworm season in Hangzhou and Shaoxing is the earliest, but this year the weather has been unfavorable. The early silkworms failed, and the late silkworms were affected by extreme cold and heavy rain, resulting in 50-60% losses. According to inquiries from various cocoon merchants, due to the lack of tenants, the number of those who paid and renewed their licenses was very small, statistically less than 20-30%. The silkworm industry is now facing another blow. As silkworms are being placed on racks, the number of cocoon merchants preparing to open their harvests will decrease further. The cocoon market in Zhejiang province this year is expected to be in dire straits.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Qimen and Fuliang Black Tea Harvests Face Deficits <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The Qimen and Fuliang black tea, which has attracted much attention, was reported by a Jiujiang telegram yesterday to have already shipped over 3,000 boxes through Gutang in Jiangxi province. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai this Saturday. However, the cost of this black tea for Chinese merchants is between 200 taels and 300 yuan, an unprecedentedly high price. The reason for this is due to the deficient harvests. According to reports from Qimen and Fuliang, the production of various mountains is only 60% of last year, while the number of tea processing firms has increased by more than 30, resulting in supply shortages and excessively high tea prices.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Local New Tea Sales to Europe Are Sluggish <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign firms' tea market continued to be quiet. Although 100-200 boxes of green tea from Huzhou and Suian, produced by local tea factories, were available, English firms were unwilling to actively purchase them due to the high tea prices. No transactions were seen throughout the city.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Ningzhou Tea Industry Plunges <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Ningzhou is an important tea-producing area in Jiangxi province. In recent years, sales to foreign firms have been sluggish, and the production area has been ravaged by bandits and communists. The output has decreased sharply year by year. Although the bandits and communists in the urban areas of this region have been suppressed, the remote rural areas are still unstable. As a result, tea merchants are hesitant, and only two tea processing firms remain, with limited operations due to tight credit. This year, the foreign firms' tea output in this region is no more than 4,000 boxes, indicating a sharp decline in the tea industry.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Piece Goods <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Both Chinese and Foreign Goods Show General Stability</p>
<p>Local Cloth: There has been very little change in recent days. Retail sales are sporadic, mainly because it is the off-season and demand from northern ports is sluggish. Although Ningbo and Wenzhou gangs are making purchases, they are also limited. Fine twills, affected by the unrest in Guangdong, rose once but have since fallen again. Those who advanced payment for coarse cloth have been gradually withdrawing. Fortunately, Flower Yarn is still strong, so the price of goods has not weakened. Yesterday, Yanghe fine twills fell slightly, Blue Double Fish remained stable, and Squirrel was still within the 7 taels range. However, Ewo &amp; Co. bleached cloth is increasingly scarce, reaching 8 taels and 65 cents. Fine cloth brands such as Colored Ball, Yanghe, and Trumpet Boy remain around 7 taels and 40 cents. Shipments of coarse twills are decreasing, but outbound traffic is also limited.</p>
<p>Eastern and Western Piece Goods: Among Eastern goods, Yuan foreign yarn is particularly strong. Point Autumn Fragrance requires 10 taels and 35 cents, fluctuating rapidly. Han Shan Temple Double Child Deer and other brands have also become stronger. Fine bombazine: yesterday, Three Friends Picture suddenly rose to 30 cents and 7.5 mils, due to the scarcity of spot goods. White crepe cloth is still difficult to rise due to the abundance of spot goods. Copper Plate remains at 4 taels, 1 mace, and 7.5 cents. Moganshan, Man and Dog, and Banana Leaf Inscribed Book brands are all at 4 taels and 1 mace. Large Swirl bombazine has softened, falling to 27.5 cents. Zhongshan flannel sales are quiet, and blue satin arrivals are increasingly abundant, making it difficult to maintain prices. Among Western goods, bleached cloth is stronger, and the brands that should be sold are lacking.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Sugar Market <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Market Transactions Become Smoother After Dividing Market</p>
<p>Huanggang Green Gradually Opens and Rises</p>
<p>Yesterday, sugar market telegrams from production areas: Cuban raw sugar prices remained unchanged. New York sugar futures for May and next year's March each rose 1 cent, with no change in other months. Java raw sugar futures also remained unchanged. In the Public Association market, buying interest in Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse white sugar was slightly active, with high-quality transactions priced at 10 taels and 65 cents, and ordinary sugar at 10 taels, 47.5 cents to 50 cents. No. 20 medium white sugar was priced at 10 taels, and supply was also short. Japanese sugar transactions were quite active: N Mark at 10 taels, 60 cents, and in short supply; SH Mark at 10 taels, 15 cents; J Mark at 10 taels, 97.5 cents to 11 taels; TK Mark at 10 taels, 60 cents; TM Mark at 10 taels, 25 cents; YP Mark at 10 taels, 92.5 cents; Minghua goods at 10 taels, 90 cents; YT Mark at 10 taels, 90 cents; YR Mark at 9 taels, 95 cents; Minghua goods at 9 taels, 97.5 cents. The market outlook is firm. Among those dumping goods, Bingchang &amp; Co. yesterday offered 200 tons of bowl green sugar for May-June delivery at 4.30 Dutch guilders, and Nanshenglong also sold 100 tons at the same price. Demand was not high. In the branded sugar market, Xiang &amp; Co. offered 3,000 bags of medium white sugar at 10 yuan, and market sentiment was tightening. The stock of domestic Huanggang Green sugar is very limited, and the market is gradually opening and rising. Yesterday, over 300 bags were offered at 7 taels and 67 cents, with high-quality goods at 7 taels, 90 cents to 95 cents. The market is very brisk and has a tendency to rise further.</p>
<h3 id="e135">North-South Goods <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Tong'an Dried Longan Opens and Rises by Two Plus</p>
<p>Tong'an dried longan was previously sluggish due to poor sales and lack of supply. Recently, market prices have risen. A batch arrived the day before yesterday, with top-grade priced at 27 taels and 60 cents, medium-grade at 23 taels, and secondary grade at 18 taels and 20 cents, an increase of two plus compared to the previous market. It is noted that the new goods from various places this year show signs of poor harvests, so the market may rise further in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e137">Sun Ke Issues Two Important Telegrams on the Current Situation <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Telegram to Chairman Chiang</p>
<p>Telegram to Gu, Chen, etc.</p>
<p>Sun Ke, Minister of Railways of the National Government, has been recuperating in Shanghai for several days. The Central Government, in order to invite him to attend the National Conference, sent representatives Wu Zhihui, Zhang Jingjiang, Li Shizeng, and Kong Xiangxi to Shanghai to urge him to go to Nanjing and to mediate in the Guangdong situation. This has been reported in previous newspapers. It is now learned that Sun Ke, in order to mediate in the current situation, issued two important telegrams on the 5th and 8th of this month, one to Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the National Government, and the other to Gu Yingfen, Chen Jitang, and others of the Guangdong Committee. Both telegrams have been published successively. They are recorded below. Telegram to Chairman Chiang: Yesterday, Brother Tie visited Shanghai and relayed your instructions, stating that you have decided to resolve the Guangdong issue through the Party, without resorting to military or political means, and that the relationship between taxation and the Party is extremely close, and it is not appropriate to passively supervise and blame at this critical juncture. Upon hearing this, I feel deeply ashamed. I have been involved in Party affairs for nearly thirty years, and I would not hesitate to go through fire and water for the benefit of the Party and the country. I am bound by great righteousness and have no room for evasion. If I still fail to fulfill my duty to offer my suggestions to you on this matter, I would not only fail you, but also the Party and the country. I dare to respectfully submit my humble opinions to you. Since you assumed office two years ago, you have worked tirelessly day and night for the Party and the country. Your desire to assist you in completing the unfinished business of the late Premier is well known to all comrades. Differences of opinion may arise from time to time, and you may express your candid views straightforwardly, but this also stems from your love for the Party and you. If it is said that there is any intention of harboring dissent, I am sure that there are millions of comrades who are willing to vouch for you with their millions of lives and fortunes. Reading the declaration of the Four Supervisors, it is indeed somewhat excessive, but the motivation is entirely for you. The misunderstandings between us have been deep, and there has been no opportunity to sit down and discuss them frankly and without reservation. Therefore, temporary anger is understandable. Now, you advocate resolving Party affairs through the Party, which is a wise statement. Danger turns into safety, and misfortune leans on fortune. The opportunity for a turnaround lies in this. The national crisis is pressing, and no one can survive alone. We must rely on all loyal comrades of the Party, based on the principle of "dying yesterday and living today," to unite sincerely, work together, divide responsibilities, and jointly take responsibility. Then, the future of the Party and the country, unified construction, and so on, will hopefully be achieved. I hope that you will work hard based on this principle, and that the psychology of the future will be transformed in one question, and that harmony and brightness will be realized on the spot. I cannot help but offer my sincere prayers. If my humble opinion is accepted, then I will not hesitate to work hard to mediate in the future, if I am driven. I am terrified at the telegram, and I await your instructions. Your brother, Sun Ke, respectfully. Urgent. Telegram to Gu, Chen, etc.: Extremely urgent, Guangzhou Committee Member Gu Quanqin, Chief Commander Chen Bonan, with respect. Since the Hu case occurred, I have been occupying a position in the Central Government but have been unable to remedy the situation. My mood of depression has turned negative. Therefore, I have been staying at home in Shanghai for more than ten days, declining all engagements. You are far away in Lingnan, and you feel deeply indignant. Therefore, you have proposed impeachment. I am concerned about the current situation and deeply worried that once a dispute arises, the war will be reborn, and unification and peace will once again become a bubble. I have been pacing back and forth, unable to sleep at night. On the day of this month, Brother Tiecheng came to Shanghai with the order of Chairman Chiang, saying that Chairman Chiang had decided to resolve the Guangdong issue within the Party and would not involve military or political matters. Furthermore, Ke's relationship with the Party and the country is extremely close, and at this critical juncture, he should come forward to mediate and should not passively blame. On the day of Wei, I sent a telegram in response. Today, Chairman Chiang entrusted Zhihui, Shizeng, Jingjiang, Yongzhi, and other gentlemen to bring a reply in person, saying that as long as it is beneficial to the revolution and the consolidation of the Party and the country, all good suggestions from comrades can be accepted. He also asked me to convey a telegram from Zhihui and others, signed by five people, to Brother Xiang, and to show me the draft telegrams personally written by Zhan Gong to both of you. Zhan Gong is loyal to the Party and has no peer in history. He advises you not to cause disputes for the sake of one person and to avoid causing suffering to the people. His words are earnest and sincere, and I was moved to tears when I read them. Thinking back to the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army, countless comrades fought bravely and sacrificed their lives to achieve what we have today. Unless it is absolutely necessary, we should never resort to war again, lest we fail our martyrs, bring disaster to the people, and allow the hidden dangers to grow and become powerful. The Soviet Union has declared to the outside world that China will completely become a Soviet nation within three years. Although this is propaganda, it makes me shudder to think about it. If civil war is truly unavoidable, it will only create opportunities for the Red bandits. The Party will perish and the country will perish. We are all followers of the Three Principles of the People. If there is a glimmer of hope to avoid war, then we should not hesitate to make any personal sacrifices. After thinking about it again and again, I believe that at this critical moment, if it is beneficial to the Party and the country, I would not hesitate to go through fire and water. I can no longer shirk my responsibility to mediate. I plan to go to Nanjing with Zhi, Shi, Jing, and Yong to speak directly to Chairman Chiang, and then discuss with all comrades the way to live in peace with each other. I urge you to maintain silence in Guangdong, stabilize the people's hearts, and not allow the situation to rush towards a difficult resolution. This is my hope. Please let me know your opinions as much as possible, and I will be responsible for mediating. Ze Ru and all comrades send their regards. Your brother, Sun Ke, respectfully.</p>

<p>Stays for a Month or More Before Going to Europe and America</p>
<p>Sun Hiwen Goes to Nanjing Again Last Night</p>
<p>Chen Mingshu, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, along with his secretary Yang Jianping, left Shanghai for Japan on the British mail ship Kashmir at 7:00 a.m. yesterday. He also specially dispatched his secretary-general, Sun Hiwen, to Nanjing by the 11:45 p.m. night train to meet with Chairman Chiang, report everything on his behalf, and bid farewell. According to Sun, when interviewed by our reporter yesterday:</p>
<p>Unexpected Travel: Chairman Chen has been thinking of traveling abroad, but he has not had the time. When he went to Nanjing last year, he strongly requested Chairman Chiang to allow him to go abroad, but his request was not granted. This spring, he telegraphed again, but it did not materialize. This time, he considered it the only opportunity and resolutely went abroad.</p>
<p>Inspection of Europe and America: Chen has applied for passports for Central Europe and the Americas. He plans to stay in Japan for a month or more, and then decide on his itinerary to Europe and America. However, in any case, he has decided not to return to China for the time being. Even if the Guangdong issue is resolved peacefully, Chen will not repeat the same mistake.</p>
<p>Trip to Jiangxi Not Confirmed: The reporter then asked if it was true that you would be ordered to go to Jiangxi to慰劳 Chiang and Cai's armies. He replied, "I will return to Shanghai within a few days. The trip to Jiangxi is baseless." When asked about Huang Shaoxiong's whereabouts, he replied, "I heard that Ji Lu will also travel to Japan. I don't know anything else."</p>

<h3 id="e141">British Minister Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Returns to Nanjing This Sunday</p>
<p>Reopening of Legal Rights Negotiations</p>
<p>Sir Miles Lampson, the British Minister to China, accompanied by his Chinese secretary, Deckmann, and others, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing on the German ship Dehe at 10:00 a.m. yesterday and stayed at the residence of the British Consul General. According to those around the British Minister, Sir Miles will stay in Shanghai for three or four days and is scheduled to return to Nanjing this Sunday. At that time, he is expected to reopen legal rights negotiations with Dr. Wang, the Minister of Foreign Affairs. It is also reported that the British Minister is scheduled to meet with important members of the British Association and the China Association at the British Consul General's residence at 11:00 a.m. today to solicit their opinions on the legal rights negotiations.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Shanghai-Guangdong Route Reopens <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Guangdong Authorities Have Agreed Not to Obstruct</p>
<p>Yushun Arrives in Shantou: The Yushun ship of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company went to Hong Kong and Guangdong this time. It first went to Hong Kong, transported a large batch of sugarcane, and then went to Guangdong Province. When the ship arrived at the Qingshan Head sea area, it saw no way forward. The captain quickly ordered the ship to reverse and retreat to another route, but the ship's hull had already run aground in the shallows. At that time, there was no way to get out of danger, so they had to telegram Hong Kong for help. The Hong Kong authorities sent a barge to unload part of the cargo to reduce the weight and drag the ship out. Upon arriving in Guangdong, they were assigned to Shantou. Yesterday, a telegram was sent from Shanghai to Shantou to ask if it was possible to return to Shanghai, but no reply has been received yet.</p>
<p>Yuan'an Stays in Xiamen: The Yuan'an ship, which can be used in place of the Xinchang ship for Hong Kong and Guangdong routes, is making its first voyage south. It was originally intended to go directly to Guangzhou, but for the sake of caution and to avoid delaying the schedule, it went to Xiamen first and stayed there. The Guangzhou passengers and cargo on board were originally intended to be transshipped to Hong Kong, but since goods shipped from Hong Kong to Guangdong had to be taxed as foreign goods, they were transshipped in Xiamen and transported to Guangzhou by smaller ships, while Yuan'an stayed in Xiamen awaiting instructions.</p>
<p>Dispatching Personnel for Consultation: The Hong Kong branch of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has been停班 for another ten days since the Shanghai-Guangdong route was seized by the Party's货. A large number of goods and passengers are transported by foreign ships instead, which is like驱雀丛 and causes huge losses to Chinese merchants. The director of the Hong Kong branch personally went to Guangdong Province to request the provincial authorities not to detain ships in order to facilitate transportation and maintain shipping. After repeated discussions, the provincial authorities agreed to allow Chinese ships to go to Guangzhou without being detained or assigned officials.</p>
<p>Dispatching Ships to Guangdong: The Guangdong authorities have agreed not to detain merchant ships anymore, so the Hong Kong branch telegraphed Xiamen, ordering the Yuan'an ship to set sail for Guangzhou immediately and operate as usual. They also telegraphed Shanghai, reporting that the commissioner of the Hong Kong branch had agreed with the provincial authorities that ships of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company could operate as usual to Guangdong without obstruction and requesting that ships be dispatched quickly to resume the Shanghai-Guangdong service. Yesterday, the Shanghai branch received this telegram and has been planning to resume the Shanghai-Hong Kong-Guangdong service, which has been suspended. It also notified the Guangdong帮 that goods and passengers to Guangdong can be transported as usual from today. Once the Taishun ship returns to Shanghai and the Guangda ship leaves the dock, the service will be resumed immediately.</p>

<p>Recuperates for One or Two Days Before Going to Nanjing</p>
<p>Mr. Huang Bingheng, former Deputy Director of the Aviation Administration, was ordered by the Central Government on March 12th of this year to go to the United States for inspection. Now that Director Zhang Huichang of the Aviation Administration has left Nanjing due to illness, the Central Government repeatedly telegraphed Huang to return to China. Huang left New York on the 12th and arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning on the Empress of Japan. Those who came to welcome him at the New Customs Wharf at 7:00 a.m. included Shen Dexie, Director of the Hongqiao Aircraft Office, Li Jingyuan, Section Chief of the Aviation Administration, and his brother Huang Guanghan, and more than ten others. The ship arrived at the port at 7:00 a.m., but it was not until 10:30 a.m. that they were carried back to the New Customs by ferry and landed. They changed cars and returned to their residence in the French Concession. Cha Zhenhu, the Navigation Section Chief of the Aviation Administration, who was sent by the Aviation Administration to Shanghai to welcome them, had returned to Nanjing the day before due to official business and could not wait any longer. Only his wife and attendants He Renshi and others (three to five people) came with Huang. It is said that Huang was originally scheduled to go to Nanjing that night, but due to the fatigue of the journey, he still needs to stay in Shanghai for one or two days before starting his journey. Huang has already telegraphed Nanjing yesterday afternoon to report.</p>

The International Chamber of Commerce should convene an international silver conference within this year to solve this urgent problem and urge the national chambers of commerce to ask their respective governments to pay attention to this.'" This proposal was passed by the delegates at the General Assembly on May 7 and has been submitted to the Proposals Committee for examination and implementation. As for the issue of silver and the global economic downturn, the representatives distributed more than 1,000 copies of the declaration, which resulted in a good phenomenon and deep interest. British government officials have made profound statements, expressing their willingness to formally join the conference and provide concrete cooperation. Arthur Balfour, the chief British representative, advocated that the conference should be held in the East, preferably in our country, and said that the British government would definitely join and support it. The Indian representative also enthusiastically supported this proposal. The Japanese representative also expressed his goodwill. The representative Nagami said that the method of saving silver prices should be drafted by our country, and Japan is very willing to cooperate when the conference is convened. According to the above-mentioned situation, the representatives believe that the present is an excellent opportunity for our country to convene an international silver conference. If the conference is organized perfectly, it will gain the participation of various countries and achieve success. We pray to the National Government to petition for its implementation as soon as possible. In this important event, please do not lose the opportunity to be an international leader because of domestic affairs. Please consider this carefully. Li Guochin, Bei Zuyi, respectfully." It is said that the China branch of the International Chamber of Commerce has already telegraphed the government for approval yesterday.</p>

<h3 id="e152">Various Trade Associations Telegraph Support for Wang Yansong's Proposal Yesterday <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>The following trade associations in this city telegraphed Wang Yansong, the representative of the Shanghai business community attending the National Assembly, yesterday: Knitting Industry Association, Department Store Association, Clothing Industry Association, Domestic Pigment Industry Association, Refining Industry Association, Local Goods Industry Association, Mineral Ash Factory Industry Association, Paint Industry Association, Bamboo Industry Association, Candle Industry Association, Shoe Industry Association, North-South Goods Exchange Industry Association, Duck Slaughtering Industry Association, Flower Industry Association, Noodle Skin Industry Association, Miscellaneous Grains Industry Association, Sesame Oil Industry Association, Lacquer Industry Association, Shaoxing Wine Industry Association, Dried Tobacco Industry Association, North Goods Industry Association, Cooked Food Industry Association, Fruit and Local Goods Industry Association, Fish Industry Association, Chicken and Duck Industry Association, Sofa Number Industry Association, Cured Meat Industry Association, Blacksmith Industry Association, Native Cloth Industry Association, Construction Factory Industry Association, Kerosene Industry Association, Flour Mill Industry Association, Rice Number Industry Association, Seafood Miscellaneous Goods Number Ginseng and Bird's Nest Industry Association, Soy Sauce Number Industry Association, Local Yellow Wine Industry Association, Fire Machine Ginning Industry Association, Silk Weaving Cotton Weaving Industry Association, Transportation Customs Declaration Industry Association, Advertising Industry Association, Embroidery Industry Association, Postal Transportation Industry Association, Sand and Gravel Industry Association, Travel Industry Association, Tea Food Industry Association, New Medicine Industry Association, Electrical Appliance Industry Association, Color Printing Industry Association, Book Industry Association, Restaurant Industry Association, Chinese Woolen Factory Industry Association, Military Uniform Industry Association, Tobacco Exchange Industry Association, Foreign Firm Tea Industry Association, Biscuit Dried Fruit Candy Canning Case, Silk Satin Industry Association, Chinese Medicine Industry Association, Electric Machine Silk Weaving Factory Industry Association, etc. The telegram reads as follows: "To Mr. Wang Yansong, Representative of the National Assembly Secretariat, Nanjing: Our country is suffering from the heavy shackles and layers of oppression of unequal treaties imposed by imperialists, and internally plagued by the rebellion of warlords who harm the country and the people. The people are haggard, and the country is about to perish. Colleagues who have experienced internal and external troubles have suffered the most. Therefore, businessmen's desire for governance is even greater than that of all sectors. Fortunately, with the efforts and struggles of our party comrades, the country has been unified, and the National Assembly has been opened as desired in accordance with the Prime Minister's will. Businessmen from all walks of life, in view of the depth of their suffering, have greater expectations for the National Assembly than other sectors. The responsibility of the businessmen's representatives is also becoming heavier. Shanghai is a gathering place for commerce, and the whole country's businessmen are watching. Mr. Representative of the Shanghai business community attending the National Assembly, your responsibility is even heavier. Now reading the newspaper, your proposal is that during the period of political tutelage, efforts should be made to restore national rights externally and to properly plan for the people's livelihood internally, which shows a clear understanding of the crux of the matter. All the public industry associations, in addition to sincerely supporting you, hope that you will persevere in striving to achieve the goal. We look forward to hearing from you soon." The original text of Wang's proposal is recorded as follows: "Since the government launched the Northern Expedition in the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, Hebei has been pacified two years later, and the whole country has entered the political tutelage program. However, rebellions have occurred repeatedly, and it has taken more than one attempt to quell them by force. In practice, it cannot be said that it has completely broken away from the era of military government. Therefore, the planned political tutelage facilities are inevitably clumsy. It was not until the end of the nineteenth year that the reactionary forces were gradually eliminated, and all facilities related to political tutelage could gradually be started. This time, the government is following the legacy of the teaching and convening the National Assembly to complete an important page of its political tutelage work. The main purpose of the National Assembly is to make the public have a deep understanding of the party platform of the Kuomintang, sincerely accept it, and at the same time, the public should select those that are suitable for the needs of the political tutelage period within the scope of the accepted party platform, and ask the government to implement them separately. This is actually the preliminary practice of the public's movement of political power. Considering the current situation, the public's needs in today's politics are to seek territorial integrity and sovereignty externally in order to restore national independence and national freedom. Internally, we must ensure that the 400 million people, although they cannot immediately reach the realm of adequate household income, can each maintain their minimum living standards, so that they have land to farm and industries to operate, and will not be displaced by disasters or take risks. This is indeed the most important task of the government today. In accordance with this idea, the following articles are proposed: (A) Those that belong to external affairs, such as the completion of tariff autonomy, have now come to an end. The abolition of consular jurisdiction is being actively pursued by the government, so there is no need to repeat it. In addition, it is believed that the government should devote all its efforts to the following matters in the next few years: (1) To recover the concessions, such as the Belgian concession in Tianjin and the British concession in Zhenjiang, which the countries concerned consider to be of little importance, but it still took considerable efforts from the diplomatic authorities to complete. As for the Japanese and French concessions in Hankou, which are relatively important, our country has been proposing them for several months, but the result is still delayed. Therefore, the recovery of the concessions, in terms of the past situation, is most difficult to proceed. The government should make double efforts. (2) To recover the leased territories and railway affiliated lands. Among the leased territories, such as France's Guangzhou Bay, there was an agreement to return it early in the Chinese Huai Conference, but now it is waiting and hesitant and unwilling to fulfill it, especially because the land is there, and it cannot be publicly overturned. Japan's lease of Lushun and Dalian Bay continues the Russian lease right, which was due early. As for the lease period extended according to Article 21, the matter was coerced, and our country's officials and people have long declared their denial. These two ports, one in the south and one in the north, are both important national defense areas of our country, and it is difficult to allow them to be occupied for a long time. As for the railway affiliated land, there is no clear provision in the unequal treaties. According to Article 16 of the Sino-Russian Agreement in Harbin in the first year of Xuantong, the so-called "land within the railway boundary that is exclusively for railway use, such as stations and factories, etc., may be managed by the company itself. The remaining land that has not been leased and the houses exclusively for the company's own use, according to the agreed drawings, not subject to the public council, will still be managed by the company itself temporarily. This remaining land should be temporarily exempted from land tax, etc." The nature of the so-called railway affiliated land is only that the railway company can manage its own land that has not been leased and is exempt from land rent. The South Manchurian Railway occupied by the Japanese can inherit a part of the Central Soviet Railway, and its rights cannot exceed those of the Central Eastern Railway. However, the Japanese hold the sole administrative power in the area, set up police and taxes, and regard it as an extension of the leased territory. Our country has been saying that it will abolish unequal treaties. The railway affiliated land is an unauthorized occupation beyond the unequal treaties and should be dealt with first in accordance with the treaty in order to seek the integrity of territorial rights. (3) To withdraw foreign troops stationed in the country. The stationing of these troops is based on unequal treaties. From Yuguan to Beiping, the origin is the Xin Chou Treaty, which is used to protect the transportation of its embassy from the capital to the sea. Now the situation has changed, and the mutual stationing of troops from various countries is either to maintain the balance of power or to have other intentions. It is not set up to protect the embassy's transportation and should have been negotiated and withdrawn long ago. As for those that exceed the unequal treaties, the situation of the South Manchurian Railway Garrison stationed by Japan is the most obvious. According to Article 2 of the Sino-Japanese Agreement on the Three Eastern Provinces in the thirty-first year of Guangxu, "The Government of Japan is willing to fulfill China's expectations, such as Russia agrees to withdraw its guard troops, or China and Russia have another well-negotiated method, the Government of Japan agrees to follow the same method." Russia withdrew its guard troops on the Central Eastern Road in the winter of the sixth year of the Republic of China. According to the agreement, Japan had no right to set up a garrison on the South Manchurian Road after the seventh year of the Republic of China. However, our country is accustomed to forgetting it, and Japan also regards the treaty as waste paper. This cannot but be attributed to the previous warlord government's playing and leaking to mislead the country. It is difficult to delay the situation any longer. (4) To negotiate with Russia and England to recover the sovereignty of Mongolia and Tibet. Since the Red Russia invaded Outer Mongolia, not only in the economic aspect, it has been manipulated by the abdomen, but also in the political and ideological aspects, it has been assimilated and anesthetized, no less than a dependency. According to the descriptions from various parties, not only has Tangnu Ulianghai been turned into territory long ago, but also many of the old place names of the four Khalkha tribes have been changed. Although Article 5 of the Sino-Russian Agreement has the condition of waiting for the Mongolian withdrawal, it is stated in Article 2 of this agreement that after negotiation in the meeting, the Soviet troops will be withdrawn from Mongolia in full. However, today the trouble of the Outer Mongolian heart and abdomen is no longer in the small number of Soviet troops stationed there, but in the all-encompassing political power. The remedy is to organize a party branch there by the central government, so that its politics can be carried out under the guidance of the party, and there is no way to get rid of the anesthesia of Red Russia. However, Outer Mongolia cannot receive merchants for transportation in one day, and it is still obstructed, let alone the transplant of party governance. Therefore, this Sino-Russian Moscow Conference must resolve the issue of receiving Outer Mongolia at the same time at the conference table, otherwise it will only discuss the restoration of trade and diplomacy, and I have not seen its benefits in practice, and the power of Red Russia is advancing southward from Outer Mongolia, and Inner Mongolia will also be affected by it. This is especially related to the national defense and safety of the provinces of Hebei and Shanxi and cannot be regarded as a slow plan. England's support for Tibet is no less deep than Russia's Outer Mongolia, or even more so. Since the collapse of the Sino-British Simla Conference, there is no agreement to restrain it, and England has continued its consistent policy in Tibet for more than ten years, and it is not as good as Russia's overthrow of the imperial system, its power in Outer Mongolia once faltered. Therefore, Outer Mongolian power has not publicly invaded Inner Mongolia, while England has used Tibet as a tiger to swallow almost three-quarters of the entire province of Xikang, and now it is advancing to Batang and Litang. In terms of border defense hidden dangers, it is more severe than Russia in Outer Mongolia. It should be proposed to negotiate with England together. In addition to acknowledging its historical trade relations in Tibet, all other political actions of our side, as the sovereign state, will be revoked, and it will be declared internally that there is no intention to assist the Dalai Lama in resisting China, so that Tibetan sovereignty may be recovered. (B) For internal affairs, the top priority should be to properly plan for the people's livelihood, as mentioned above. However, in terms of clothing, food, housing, and transportation, the old saying goes, "Food is the people's heaven," which seems to be particularly important. Moreover, the majority of our country's people are engaged in agriculture. If we can develop agriculture to solve the people's food problem, then purchasing power will increase, and the industrial and commercial sectors will also prosper, and clothing, housing, and transportation will also be solved in conjunction. Therefore, the government's current policy seems to be to focus on this with all the manpower and material resources that can be concentrated, in order to provide a key point. The matters that should be handled are briefly listed below: (1) The central government and the provincial governments should raise funds to organize large-scale immigration companies, lend agricultural tools, seeds, and build houses, and continue to immigrate to Xinjiang, Qinghai, Xikang, Chahar, and other places for a period of several years. After the expiration of the period, the atmosphere will be opened, and free immigrants will become more and more prosperous, then this move can be stopped. This will not only solve the unemployment problem and the rice shortage problem, but also consolidate the northwest border defense. (2) Disaster prevention fund. The government has had this plan, but it is impossible to speculate whether it is currently being implemented. It is believed that it should be strictly implemented according to the planned plan. If the annual budget is insufficient and the allocated funds cannot be equal to the amount, it seems appropriate to add some from the consumption tax on cigarettes to supplement it. After this fund is raised, some will be used to purchase food for storage and standby, roughly like the old system of storing grain, and some will be used exclusively for river management and forest cultivation in various provinces. The government's current financial resources are used to divert the Huai River and manage the Yellow River, all of which are used to withdraw the Gengzi indemnity, and there are many main rivers and tributaries in various provinces that are related to farmland rights and should be dredged. Since we must plan and take care of both, it is definitely necessary to open up another source of wealth, so as not to cause delay. (3) The improvement of agricultural crops and animal husbandry should be set as the performance evaluation of each county. The provincial government or the central government should select people with rich knowledge and technology to go to each county to guide and handle the matter, and the county government should be responsible for raising funds. This matter does not cost much. Ding County, Hebei, has already made some progress in recent years. It is said that if it is promoted year by year and continued for ten years, Ding County alone can increase production by 70 million yuan per year. This is a near path to solving the people's livelihood problem, but if the government does not preside over it, it will only be difficult for private forces to popularize it in the country. (4) To strictly limit the establishment of national farmers' banks. The reason why the rural economy cannot develop is entirely due to the lack of a low-interest financing agency. The farmers' bank is set up to remedy this defect. However, considering that those who have actually complied with the order to establish it, except for Jiangsu and Zhejiang, are rarely heard of. Moreover, although Jiangsu and Zhejiang have established them, they have not actually been popularized in each county, and there is little benefit to farmers. It is believed that the government should investigate the established ones to see if their achievements meet the needs of farmers, and those that have not been established should be strictly ordered to raise funds within a time limit. The government uses this as the performance evaluation of the provincial government, and the provincial government uses this as the performance evaluation of the county government, so that it will not be a day-to-day affair and there will be no deadline for completion. To sum up, the main points of working hard to restore national rights externally are: (1) To recover the concessions, (2) To recover the leased territories and railway affiliated lands, (3) To withdraw foreign troops stationed in the country, (4) To recover the sovereignty of Mongolia and Tibet. For internal affairs, the people's livelihood should be cultivated, starting with revitalizing farmland water conservancy. The main points are: (1) Immigration and reclamation, (2) Establishment of disaster prevention fund, (3) Improvement of agricultural work, (4) Universal establishment of farmers' banks, all of which are considered in the order of priority and the current financial resources of the government. I dare not make any exaggerated remarks to avoid any blame. As for the articles on properly planning for the people's livelihood, it seems appropriate to stipulate them in the chapter on national economic law, so that officials and people can share their faith and abide by them. Is there any correctness in submitting it for public decision?</p>

<p>The Native Cloth Industry Association and the Yarn Cloth Industry Association in this city have sold 200,000 packages of native cloth that were prepared to be shipped to Yingkou and other places in the three eastern provinces. Since they were collected customs duties and shelved, they have been accumulated in various stacks and have not been able to be shipped. They have repeatedly petitioned the Ministry of Finance and the tax authorities, but there has been no considerable result. The two associations, in view of the fact that the weather is approaching the moldy season and the price of yarn is falling day by day, if it is delayed any longer, the native cloth will definitely develop mold and rot, and the original selling price will change, or even cause disputes between the buying and selling parties. Therefore, although the Shanghai National Assembly representative Wang Yansong received a reply letter, he has forwarded the situation to the Ministry of Finance to expedite the approval. He also believes that the crux of the matter lies in the Customs Administration. Therefore, he also sent a letter to Shanghai Representative Wang Yansong to join Nantong National Assembly Representative Zhang Shengbo, (according to the yarn cloth industry, that is, Nantong cloth merchants, to expedite the Customs Administration to issue an order yesterday to the Jianghai Customs to exempt exports, so that merchants can transport it,)</p>

<p>Opposing the Collection of Slaughter Tax</p>
<p>The Shanghai Fresh Meat Industry Association, due to the municipal government's point-by-point collection of slaughter tax, has aroused unanimous opposition from the industry throughout the city. Yesterday afternoon, a members' congress was held in the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Hall, with more than 1,200 members attending. The Municipal Party Branch sent representatives Lu Yin Chu and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent representatives Sun Mingqi to attend and guide. Rong Qianchu, Wan Yongchu, and Yan Weixiao were elected as chairmen, and Huang Jitang recorded the proceedings. After the ritual was completed, the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting and the situation of sending representatives to Beijing to petition. Resolutions: (1) Request the municipal government to abolish the slaughter tax in the urban area and change it to a business tax. Before the change, they are still willing to pay the amount they acknowledge. (2) Request the abolition of the technician inspection fee. (3) Request the abolition of the pre-slaughter and post-slaughter fees. (4) Request the municipal government to no longer force the industry to buy tickets and pay taxes after the 25th of this month, otherwise the entire city will suspend business. (5) Oppose the municipal government's construction of a new slaughterhouse and still allow the industry to run its own slaughterhouses in different districts. The meeting was adjourned after the discussion.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Knitting Industry Association, in view of the fact that the procedure for the Unified Tax Bureau to fill out the unified tax transportation permits for each factory is complicated and often delayed, causing great pain to the factories, has repeatedly sent personnel to discuss with the Unified Tax Bureau. Now, the tax bureau has agreed to improve and allow the association to print and distribute blank transportation permits for the knitting part of cotton yarn directly woven into finished products. Each knitting factory can fill them out by themselves. It is reported that the association has scheduled to hold a general trade association congress this afternoon to report on the printing and distribution of transportation permits.

<h3 id="e156">Pacific and New York Line Far East Shipping Alliance <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Resisting the Disruption of Non-Member Ships</p>
<p>Establishing New Rules for Pre-arranged Contracts</p>
<p>This year, the competition between Sino-American shipping lines is the most intense and the turmoil is the greatest. On the Pacific and New York routes, new ships are being launched at fast speeds. Generally, ships that are not members of the alliance are drastically lowering freight rates, causing indescribable chaos. Therefore, almost all Sino-American liners are suffering losses. Now, the shipping freight alliance has specially convened all members to discuss relief measures in order to resist the disruption of non-member ships. They have agreed on new methods to resist non-member ships, to be implemented on the 15th. This matter is of utmost importance to the shipping industry, and a detailed account of the situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>General Meeting The Freight Alliance Operating on the New York Route</p>
<p>To unite the strength of its members due to the increasing number of non-member ships, and to jointly fight against non-member ships in unison with the Pacific Shipping Alliance, this time all members were convened. Representatives from eighteen shipping companies attended, including American-Mongolian Shipping Company Baohe Agency, Babb Shipping Company, Tianxiang Manager, Blue Funnel Company Battery Company, Tianxiang Agency Dalaiyang Firm, Nippon Yusen Kaisha, Osaka Company, American Post Changxing, Jardine Matheson, and Kawasaki. They agreed on a new freight rate, divided into a pre-arranged contract rate for members' ships and a non-contract rate, so that cargo can be attracted, and disruptors will have no way to apply their tricks.</p>
<p>New Rate Types After discussion, the alliance stipulated new</p>
<p>rules, the method is, for all export goods loaded to the Pacific or New York routes, there has always been only one freight rate. Now, it is divided into two: (1) For customers who load on ships of alliance members and who sign a shipping contract in advance, the freight rate can enjoy special benefits. Regardless of the type of goods, the freight can be reduced by two US dollars per ton (approximately eight yuan in Shanghai currency). (2) If customers do not sign a loading contract with members in advance, the freight rate will be cancelled according to the newly established rate, which is two US dollars more expensive compared to signing a contract. It is stipulated that customers who sign contracts this month must not load non-member ships starting on the 15th.</p>
<p>Freight Contents After a detailed investigation by the reporter, the contents of the two types of freight are specially recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(Goods Name) (Quantity) (Contract Price) (Non-Contract Price) Ore Per Ton Six Dollars and Fifty Cents Eight Dollars and Fifty Cents</p>
<p>Duck Feathers Per Ton 10.0 22.0</p>
<p>Oils Per Ton 6.5 85.</p>
<p>Eggs Per Ton 10.0 12.0</p>
<p>Tobacco Leaves Per Ton 12.0 14.0</p>
<p>Copperware Per Ton 14.0 16.0</p>
<p>Leather Per Ton Six Dollars and Fifty Cents Eight Dollars and Fifty Cents</p>
<p>Walnuts Per Ton 6.5 8.5</p>
<p>Tea Leaves Per Ton 8.5 10.5</p>
<p>Ramie Per Ton 7.5 9.5</p>
<p>Wool Per Ton 8.0 10.0</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Goods Per Ton 14.0 16.0</p>
<p>Signing Contracts Competitively After the announcement of this new method, major foreign firms in Shanghai handling export business, such as Yuntong, Anding, Beide, Flander, Ruifeng, Longmao, Shunyu, and Jardine Matheson, all went to the alliance yesterday to request signing pre-arranged contracts for loading Pacific and New York export goods in order to enjoy superior freight benefits. Yesterday, twelve firms reported signing contracts. It is expected that the number of attendees signing this loading contract will increase even more in the next two days.</p>
<p>Requesting Membership The new rules of the two alliances this time are enough to determine the fate of the general disruptive wildcat ships that have not joined the alliance. Where there is profit, people will inevitably flock to it. American firm Fulaiyang, which also newly operates the Pacific-New York route, has not yet joined the alliance. Upon receiving this news, its manager, Mr. Afolited, has reported requesting to join as a member. After a general meeting resolution, it is hoped that his membership will be approved. Those who have not joined the alliance will no longer be able to engage in irregular competition in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Yesterday's News of the Bookbinding Industry Strike <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau Ordered to Resume Work First</p>
<p>The Apprentice Problem Has Been Resolved</p>
<p>Eighty-five bookbinding workshops, including Ma Hongji, which does both Chinese and Western-style bookbinding, have been on strike in this city. Yesterday, fifty more shops, including Zhu Jinji, joined the strike, greatly affecting publications. The apprentice problem was resolved yesterday through mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau. The wage issue still needs to be reviewed and handled. It is also ordered to resume work immediately. The details of each situation are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Strike Expanded The day before yesterday, more than 1,200 workers from eighty-five Chinese and Western-style bookbinding workshops, including Ma Hongji, in the Zhabei area, went on strike because their request to amend the terms of treatment and increase wages by 40% was not met. Yesterday, more than 500 workers from more than forty workshops, including Zhu Jinji, Pu Xieji, Shen Heji, Lu Guiji, and Tang Yunji, in the British Concession, more than one hundred workers from six workshops, including Wu Fuju and Shu Yiji, in the Nanshi, and more than two hundred workers from more than ten workshops, including Shen Ji, Chen Xieji, and Qin Bingji, in the Yangshupu area, uniformly joined the strike. As a result, the number of strikers has increased to more than 2,000, and there are already 240 workshops on strike. If this is extended, publications will inevitably be greatly affected.</p>
<p>Mediation Meeting Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau</p>
<p>convened labor and management for mediation. Ding Handong and Xu Hanqing, representatives from the bookbinding industry association, and Chen Zhaoqing and Ren Changfu, representatives from the bookbinding industry union, attended. The meeting was chaired by Yin Yongxi from the Social Affairs Bureau and recorded by Wang Huqin. The labor side stated the reasons for the workers' strike, saying that the management had no sincerity in accepting the conditions. The management stated the reasons for not being able to accept them. After a lengthy discussion, the chairman considered repeatedly and stated briefly that the bureau would order the workers to resume work immediately. Regarding the issue of wage increases, he ordered the management to turn to the book industry association to request it, and a firm reply must be given within ten days. Then, the bureau will convene mediation in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>Apprentice Problem In accordance with the city's interim apprentice rules</p>
<p>and factory standards for employing apprentices, ordinary workers, those with fewer than fifty workers, can recruit five apprentices, those with more than one hundred workers can recruit fifteen apprentices, and those with more than three hundred workers can recruit twenty apprentices. If there is an organizational branch, the number is based on each branch. Male and female children under the age of twelve must not be employed. The management representative agreed to comply with this. The labor representative agreed to find ways to persuade the workers to resume work on the 15th.</p>
<h3 id="e158">The Incense and Candle Industry Again Requests a Reduction in Business Tax <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>The City Candle Industry Association requested a reduction in the business tax on incense and candles. Yesterday, it sent a document to the various industry associations' tax rate research committee, stating that it was submitting a request for the Shanghai Municipal Government to reduce the business tax on incense and candles because the tax rate was too high. It should be listed as the same as the candle and soap industry. It said, "Having read in the newspaper that the Shanghai Municipal Government has now formulated a standard business tax rate table, with the item of incense and candles having a tax rate of 10 per mille, etc., after reading it, we were extremely alarmed. Upon investigation, both incense and candles are daily necessities. Now, the government taxes them at 10 per mille, which seems to be unevenly weighted compared to the candle and soap industry, which is of equal nature. The reviewing officials consider candles and soap to be daily necessities for the people, and taxing them too heavily may be detrimental to people's livelihoods. Therefore, they have carefully considered reducing it and levying a tax rate of 1 per mille, understanding the difficulties of merchants, which cannot be said to be not thorough. Now, for incense and candles, which have the same function, a tax ten times heavier is added. Favoring one over the other is probably not the original intention of the reviewing officials. Probably because there are many categories and the review is inevitably flawed, the industry feels left out. Now, we humbly present the reasons for the amendment and reduction that should be made, and we urge you to review and transfer them. According to the items of candles and soap, one is to replace the lamp, and the other is to remove dirt. The function is originally very grand and universal. However, the products of our industry, such as incense, are enough to kill insects and stop odor, and are prepared by households, which are not inferior to soap. As for native candles and foreign candles, the materials are the same, and the uses are exactly the same. The weight is the same. For tax rules, there should be no difference at all. Secondly, foreign candles are more expensive than native candles. In poor rural areas, due to financial constraints, those who abandon them and use them cannot be counted. Our government strives to keep the tax rate low for universally used items for the poor and hardship classes in order to relieve people's difficulties, and all the lands are covered. This is the second reason why the tax on native candles should not be increased. Our industry originally did not dare to complain about the government's measures. However, the facts are like this, so how can we remain silent? Therefore, we specially state the situation below, and we urge your association to quickly strive hard according to the facts, and be sure to revise the business tax rate of the incense and candle industry to 1 per mille in order to alleviate business difficulties and value people's livelihoods. We will be extremely grateful."</p>

<p>The Fundraising Method Has Not Yet Been Determined</p>

According to Mr. Lin Kanghou, a member of the fundraising committee, the fundraising method has been decided by the committee's fifty members, each responsible for raising 20,000 dollars, totaling one million dollars.

<h3 id="e165">Flour Broker Pan Ruijie Was Almost Kidnapped <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Fortunately, He Jumped Out of the Car to Escape</p>
<p>At 10:45 AM yesterday, a kidnapping case occurred at the entrance of the New Kaihe Flour Exchange in Nanshi. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Operating Flour Pan Jiachi, with the courtesy name Ruijie, is a broker</p>
<p>at No. 52 of the exchange. He is from Luodian and is 47 years old. He used to open the Ruiji Flour Company at the entrance of Gongyi Lane on New Laji Bridge, specializing in the spot flour of Fufeng Company. His residence is rented in a foreign house at No. 138 Papu Road in the French Concession.</p>
<p>Once Kidnapped After being kidnapped and ransomed once in</p>
<p>October of last year, his whereabouts were slightly secretive, but he still went to the exchange every day, riding a black car he prepared himself. The license plate number of the car is 3326 in the Public Concession and 2378 in the Chinese area. He went to the exchange to work, rain or shine.</p>
<p>Encountered Danger for the Second Time Unexpectedly, after the flour market</p>
<p>closed yesterday, Pan sent the doorman to call the car parked at the entrance of Danfeng Street to come over, preparing to board the car to go to the Ruiji Company to inspect matters. At that time, a young man in a Western suit asked Sun Yufeng, the gatekeeper of the exchange, whether the flour exchange was about to move. The gatekeeper did not take it seriously and nodded, saying yes, and also told him where to move.</p>
<p>Three Kidnappers At that time, Pan's chauffeur, Shi Jiajun, from</p>
<p>Yangzhou (24 years old), had already driven the car close to the entrance. Pan then called his son, Pan Fangkang, to get into the car first, and he followed. However, the left side of the car door was not closed. The chauffeur was about to turn the engine, when three people wearing black robes and standing in the French Concession, tall and mighty, rushed quickly to the car.</p>
<p>The Hostage Escaped Each of the three people held a handgun, first</p>
<p>scaring the chauffeur into silence and forcing him to get out of the car. One person held a gun and opened the right side of the car door, seemingly threatening. Although Pan was burly, he was very alert and knew they were not good people. So, he kicked open the left side of the car door with one foot, jumped down with a strong force, and ran into the head door of the exchange, shouting kidnapping.</p>
<p>Police Surrounded and Arrested At that time, the gatekeeper and</p>
<p>pedestrians on the street began to pay attention and shouted in unison. The four robbers, each holding a handgun, sped away in a car parked on the side of the road towards the French Concession. After the news was received by the second division of the first district, Chief Inspector Mao Shengzheng led the entire police team to surround and arrest them. However, they were nowhere to be found. They returned to the scene of the incident to investigate and strictly investigate, but according to Pan, he had not received a threatening letter beforehand.</p>

<h3 id="e167">Three Children Were Burned to Death in a Careless Fire in a Caojiadu Shack <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Two Other Children Were Burned</p>
<p>A Cry of Disaster Victims</p>
<p>At about 9:45 AM yesterday (the 13th), on the wasteland at the intersection of Binlang Road, opposite the Gongyi Yarn Factory on Labosheng Road in West Shanghai, a fire broke out in shack No. 10, where Jiangbei poor people lived. While cooking, they inadvertently left the fire unattended, and suddenly thick smoke filled the air and pierced the roof. The police officer on duty there saw it and immediately reported it to the Caojiadu Fire Brigade, which drove to the scene to put out the fire. However, because the shacks were close together and the wind was blowing violently, the fire had spread widely, and there was a blaze of fire. After the firefighters worked hard to put out the fire, it was extinguished after about an hour. It is estimated that 30 to 40 shacks were burned down. Because the fire was fierce, two boys and one girl were hiding in the fire pit. Two other boys and one girl had their skin burned. The firefighters then dug out the bodies of the three children, all of whom had become charred wood, which was unbearable to witness. One body had its limbs burned off. After being identified by their families (one boy named Qiao Longkouzi, four years old, another boy named Xia Xiaokouzi, also four years old, and one girl named Feng Xiaomazi, also four years old, all from Gaoyou), they were taken back for burial. The two injured children were also sent to the hospital for treatment, and their injuries were quite severe. At that time, dozens of poor people, big and small, who were affected by the disaster, gathered at the fire scene, wailing and crying, which was extremely miserable. Then, Chief Ren, the district chief of the sixth district police station, sent police to the scene to investigate for a week, and immediately detained Wang Xueshi (28 years old), a woman from Baoying who was in charge of the fire, and brought her back to the station for interrogation. After an interrogation, she immediately prepared a document and sent it to the third section of the Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e168">An 18-Year-Old Apprentice Blackmailed a Doctor <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>The Doctor Received a Total of Eight Letters</p>
<p>The Handwriting Seems to Be from Two People</p>
<p>A Letter After Zhu Genli Was Kidnapped</p>
<p>It Is Also Related to the Apprentice</p>
<p>On the 17th of last month, someone went to a doctor's clinic and asked him to go to Li Shengmin's house at No. 702 Hadong Road to treat a disease. The doctor went by car. When he arrived at his destination, he asked around and found no one by the name of Li Min. So, he drove back. The next day, he received a letter delivered by mail, signed by Li Shengmin, which stated that the invitation to the doctor yesterday was originally intended to kidnap him, but because of face, he was not harmed. Please send 55,000 yuan to Xibaoshan Road, Zhabei, as soon as possible. The letter included a bullet. The doctor sent someone to the agreed place to negotiate, but no one arrived after waiting for a long time, so he gave up. However, he received as many as four threatening letters after this. On the 3rd of this month, he received a letter signed by the San Kai Party, demanding 1,000 yuan and instructing him to send the money to Gan Weimin at No. 2 Beifujian Road Printing Office. The doctor reported the information, and the police wrote a reply. The day before yesterday, Gan's reply was received, and Detective Wang Yingjie was sent to disguise himself and wait in front of the printing office. At the same time, a letter in Gan's name was sent by the postman. He saw Huang Yongqing, an 18-year-old worker from Wuxi, receiving the letter. Detective Wang arrested him without waiting for him to open it. He then went to Huang's house at No. 733 Maigen Road and found the reply to Gan Weimin's letter. Only then did he know that Gan was Huang's pseudonym. However, the handwriting of the letters signed by the San Kai Party and Gan was different from that of the letters signed by Li Shengmin. Therefore, it is not yet possible to determine whether the eight letters before and after were written by the same bandit. However, according to the police's identification, the handwriting of the last two letters was similar to that of the threatening letters received after Zhu Genli, who lived at No. 212 Changsha Road, was kidnapped. Therefore, it is speculated that Huang Yongqing may be related to the kidnapping and blackmail of Zhu. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Special District Local Court for questioning. The defendant hired a lawyer to defend him, saying that the defendant was only 16 years old. When asked about it, Huang admitted that the last two letters were written by him. Judge Xu Ting ordered him to be detained for further questioning because the police still needed to investigate.</p>
<h3 id="e169">A Case of a Female Corpse <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>The Widow of Shen Xuan Fell into the River</p>
<p>The No. 876 Sampan Escaped</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Weituoma Road Water Police Station received a phone call from the Blue Funnel Wharf reporting that a female corpse had floated up. So, they sent Chinese constable No. 47 to bring the corpse to the police station, and immediately sent detective Wang Haiquan to investigate. According to the report of the woman Shen Xuan, the deceased was her widow, 26 years old, from Ningbo, and lived at No. 376 Zhoujiazui Road. Her husband had only been dead for a month. At 11:40 PM on May 11, she crossed the river to Pudong and did not know she was dead. However, the detective's investigation revealed that the deceased fell into the water at the Lan Road Wharf to the Asia Wharf in Pudong. She hired Sampan No. 876. The sampan was seized, but the boatman had escaped. However, it was in the middle of the night, so it was very confusing as to why the deceased crossed the river and died in Pudong. But the boatman escaped, so it is difficult to find the truth. Her body has been taken to the Southern Wharf Life Saving Bureau. It has now been reported to the Local Court for inspection.</p>

<p>Wang Weihu Was Naturally Furious</p>
<p>Fu Liu's Head Was Cut with a Knife</p>
<p>The Assault Resulted from a Reason</p>
<p>Sentenced to Three Months in Prison with a Two-Year Reprieve</p>
<p>Wang Weicai from Suqian and his wife, Xie, had lived at No. 107 Xiamen Road for a long time. Fu Liu lived at No. 99 next door and often went to Wang's house to chat. Because Xie was slightly beautiful, he often teased her. It was not until July of last year that they had a relationship. From then on, they secretly cheated, and Wang did not know. On the evening of the 10th of this month, Fu Liu learned that Wang had gone out, sneaked into Xie's inner room, and indulged in love. At midnight, Wang returned, and Fu was still sleeping with the woman. Wang was filled with anger when he saw this dirty sight. He ran to the kitchen and took a sharp knife to the room to commit violence. Although Fu was aware of it, he did not have time to escape. His head was cut with a knife. Wang wanted to commit suicide, but the second landlord arrived and persuaded him. Wang threw the knife on the ground and accidentally injured his foot. Fu took the opportunity to escape. The next morning, Wang surrendered to the Laoza Police Station, saying that he had been harmed by Fu for no reason. The head of the police sent detectives to arrest Fu, but he was nowhere to be found. So, he sent Wang to the hospital for treatment. On the way, he told the detectives the reason for the quarrel. The detectives believed that Wang should not have made false accusations, so they brought him back to the police station and waited for investigation. The night before last, the police detectives were performing inspection duties on the tram on Beihai Road. They saw a passenger with a head injury. When asked, he said he was Fu Liu. So, they took him to the police station. The head of the police questioned why he did not report it at the time. Fu replied that he knew he was wrong. The head of the police ordered the detectives to summon Xie to the police station for questioning. According to her, Fu often came to her room with a sharp blade. Because she was afraid of his power, she endured the humiliation and followed him, against her will. The head of the police waved her away and ordered her to go to the Special District Local Court for questioning the next morning. Yesterday morning, the Special Court interrogated her. Xie avoided appearing in court. After Judge Xu Ting interrogated Fu and Wang, he found that Wang Weicai had committed violence with a knife and injured someone. He sentenced him to three months in prison with a two-year reprieve, taking into account that the incident was caused by a reason. The knife was confiscated.</p>

<p>Starts on the 16th of this month</p>
<p>One departure every ten minutes</p>
<p>The area between Dinghai Bridge in Puxi and Qingningsi in Pudong sees many workers from Qingningsi working in factories in Yangshupu, commuting early in the morning and late at night, making the traffic extremely frequent. The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities once tried to operate a cross-river ferry service here in the 17th year of the Republic, but it was discontinued due to the shallow and silted shores on the Puxi side, which made it difficult for the ferry to dock. However, recognizing the need, the bureau included the cross-river ferry service in the first phase of its expansion plan when it considered expanding the municipal ferry service last year. Subsequently, it ordered the construction of ferries and, under the supervision of the Bureau of Public Works, built floating docks, actively preparing for the service. The ferry and the Qingningsi dock had already been inspected and accepted, and the Dinghai Bridge dock was recently completed. It is reported that the Bureau of Public Utilities has scheduled the official launch of the ferry service starting on the 16th of this month, with departures every ten minutes from 5:00 AM to 8:00 PM. The fare is eight copper coins per person per trip, and vehicles and goods can also be transported at a low cost.

<p>Extended for another half month</p>
<p>Deadline is the 25th of this month</p>
<p>The exchange of rent voucher tickets in this city, which were requisitioned earlier, was started by the Municipal Finance Bureau on February 6th of this year, originally scheduled to end on March 6th. Later, with the approval of the Municipal Government, the bureau extended the period for one month, continuing the exchange from April 11th. This was announced in various newspapers and notices were posted to inform the public. Now, the extended period is about to expire again. After verification by the bureau, there are still a small number of vouchers that have not been exchanged. Article 2 of the Regulations for Exchanging Vouchers stipulates that exchanges are not allowed after the deadline. Moreover, the deadline could have been enforced after the extension. However, the Municipal Government, considering that some owners holding these vouchers may not have been able to come to the bureau to exchange them due to certain reasons, has approved the bureau's request to extend the period for another half month, starting from the 11th of this month, to protect their rights. It is said that after this extension, the deadline will be enforced according to the law.</p>

Recently, it has been heard that merchants and residents of this town, clinging to old habits, are still planning to hold a fair on the 28th day of the abolished lunar third month, which wastes money and time. Moreover, communist bandits are lurking in various places, constantly plotting disturbances, which may take advantage of the opportunity to disrupt public order, which is not insignificant. It is the duty of this office to plan ahead and prevent problems before they arise. Therefore, a public notice is hereby issued to prohibit such activities in order to prevent problems from arising.

<h3 id="e176">Further Report on the Conflict Between Fishing Boats and the Shipping Department in Wusong Yunzaobang <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper reported on the misunderstanding that occurred between fishing boats docked in Wusong Yunzaobang and the Shipping Department of the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities, which led to a conflict. It is now learned that the fishermen were greatly angered after the incident, so they refused to unload any of their catch for sale. Yesterday, various fish markets showed signs of closing down, and various businesses were panicked. Details are described as follows:</p>
<p>Business Letter: Most of the commercial market in Wusong relies on the fishing season. After hearing this news, everyone panicked and held a temporary meeting. They jointly sent a letter to the Wusong Chamber of Commerce for assistance. The businesses that signed the letter included Gan Fengtai, Hua Chang, Wan Sheng, Rui Long, Fu Chang, Yong Feng, and more than 200 others.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Situation: Yesterday, the crew members of various fishing boats refused to work because the case of the Shipping Department of the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities injuring the crew members had not been resolved. Therefore, the fish in the cabins could not be unloaded for sale, and various fish markets were virtually closed, creating an atmosphere of panic. People flocked to the Wusong Chamber of Commerce, waiting anxiously for a solution. Until about 4:00 PM, Yang Shaozhen, the director of the Shipping Department, replied to Zheng Shushan, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, saying that he had reported the situation to the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities and that he could not solve it. At that time, the water patrol team suddenly sent a letter to the Chamber of Commerce, handing over Wang Jinyu, Lü Wanzhi, Lü Wannian, and Lü Wancheng, who had been bailed out the day before, saying that they were ordered by their superiors to transfer them to the court. However, the Bureau of Public Utilities did not send anyone to Wusong, so the Chamber of Commerce could not mediate.</p>
<p>Dispatching Personnel for Investigation: The Society Bureau paid close attention to this incident due to its impact on the Wusong market. Therefore, Wang Defa was sent to Wusong around 1:00 PM yesterday to investigate the incident with various institutions in Wusong and fish markets such as Cuisheng, Baofeng, and Shentai. He returned to Shanghai around 4:00 PM to report the situation for verification.</p>
<p>Crew Members File Lawsuit: Wang Jinyu, the injured crew member, was sent to the Haibin Public Hospital for treatment by the Chamber of Commerce the day before. Jiang Yisheng, the president of the hospital, and the doctor examined the injuries and signed a medical certificate, which stated: "Wang Jinyu, 39 years old, from Yancheng, Jiangsu, a sailor, was sent by the Wusong Chamber of Commerce. (Self-report) He was hit with a pole around 2:00 PM today, causing a lot of bleeding from his head and severe pain.

<h3 id="e184">Retrial of Young Woman's Lawsuit Demanding Alimony Opens <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Judge Persuasively Tries to Reconcile</p>
<p>Young Woman Remains Uncompromising</p>
<p>The case of Xu Xishi, a young woman from Shanghai who filed a lawsuit against her father-in-law, Xu Zhilan, demanding alimony of 10,000 yuan because she refused to live with her husband, was appealed by Xu Zhilan. The retrial was held at the Jiangsu High Court the day before yesterday. As reported in yesterday's newspaper, the two parties involved in the case were an elderly man with white hair and a young woman with elegant demeanor, presenting an interesting contrast in court. The details of the interrogation on that day are recorded as follows: Around 3:00 PM, Zheng Zhiguo, the presiding judge, summoned Xu Zhilan to the deliberation chamber first. (Question) Has the family been divided? (Answer) The family was divided last month. (Question) Is your appeal because you are unwilling to pay alimony? (Answer) My business has been losing money in recent years, and I am heavily in debt. I really have no ability to pay such a large sum. (Question) Then how do you plan to deal with your daughter-in-law? (Answer) I want them to live together as husband and wife. My ancestral home is Ningbo, and I still have some thin fields that are enough to live a simple life. We should share blessings and misfortunes together. Demanding alimony is really impossible. Moreover, I am already over sixty years old and my energy is declining. According to regulations, I should be supported by my children, how can a father-in-law support his daughter-in-law? At this time, Fan Ming, the lawyer representing the appellee, submitted a list of Xu Zhilan's current assets, which stated that he had about 600,000 yuan in property. However, Xu Zhilan pointed out one by one that some properties had been mortgaged and some properties had been sold. After offsetting each other, he was still in debt. The judge then summoned Xu Ding's, (Question) What is your opinion on the original judgment? (Answer) In addition to alimony, I also need 8,000 yuan for my young daughter's education expenses. (Question) Do you know how much property your father-in-law has now? (Answer) About 100,000 yuan. (Question) Can you specify the various properties? Xu Ding's was silent and unable to answer. The judge then asked, "Have you and your husband always been harmonious?" (Answer) Very harmonious. (Question) Have you always lived together? (Answer) We lived together. The judge then summoned Xu Xiaofu to the court, (Question) Where do you live now? (Answer) I live with my brother now. (Question) Did you sign the separation agreement yourself? (Answer) Yes. (Question) Do you know how much property your father has? (Answer) There is no property now. (Question) Do you have a daughter? (Answer) Yes. (Question) Does your father treat you well? (Answer) They treat me well. (Question) Are you and your wife harmonious? (Answer) We have always been harmonious. However, since I suffered from madness last year, she often drove me out, did not give me clothes, and did not give me food. I had no choice but to live with my brother temporarily. (Question) Do you want to live with your wife now? (Answer) I really want to. I hope the judge will fulfill my wish. At this point, the judge tried to mediate, saying to both parties, "This case is a family misfortune. It is rare for a daughter-in-law to sue her father-in-law. I think it is better to reconcile." He then asked Xu Zhilan, "What is your intention?" (Answer) I have two options: (1) I will go home and live with my husband, and I will treat each room equally. (2) Or call her to live in Ningbo, because there are ancestral fields in Ningbo that can support her. The judge then asked Xu Ding's, "How about living with your husband?" (Answer) I don't want to. (Question) Since you are husband and wife, you should live together. It is better for you to go to Ningbo with your husband. (Answer) I am not used to living in Ningbo, and I am afraid of being bullied by them in Shanghai. (Question) Since you married a Ningbo man, you should go to Ningbo. Moreover, you are now demanding alimony, which may not necessarily be fulfilled. Even if you can achieve the goal of 10,000 yuan, how many years can you use it? In the future, it will still be useless. However, despite the judge's gentle persuasion, Xu Ding's remained stubborn, and the result was ineffective. Shen Yuan, the presiding judge of the First Civil Court, then changed to the First Court and ordered the two lawyers to begin the debate. First, Zhong Hongsheng, the lawyer for the original appellant, strongly argued that Xu Ding's demand for alimony had no legal basis and was unreasonable. He also cited the Family Law and asked the court to revoke the original judgment. Then, Zhang Henghai, the second lawyer for the original appellant, supplemented that the original appellant was factually unable to bear the alimony, and it should also be rejected in reason. Then, Fan Ming, the lawyer representing the appellee, responded, requesting that the original judgment be upheld. Around 5:00 PM, the judge declared the debate in this case to be concluded and announced that the judgment would be announced on the 15th of this month.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Fire at Dongjiadu Straw Paper Factory <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>The Lidachao Straw Paper Factory, opened by Yao Chunrong from Wuxi at the southern end of Sanguantang, Dongjiadu, Pudong, has been around for seven or eight years. Later, due to the prosperous business, a rope-making factory was added two years ago. Both factories employ seventy or eighty male and female workers. Yao and his wife closed the door yesterday morning and went to Puxi to visit their relatives. Unexpectedly, at 3:30 PM, a fire suddenly broke out in the pile of rice straw at the door of the factory. Thick smoke filled the air, and then the fire broke out. At that time, the wind was quite strong, and the fire quickly spread, making it impossible to approach. The workers fled outwards. The police officers from the Third Sub-precinct and Third Precinct reported to the precinct, and Director Dong immediately led all the police officers to the scene and sounded the alarm whistle. Soon, the Huachang Kenpian Factory and the Dongjiadu Special Zone Fire Brigade in Puxi drove water pump trucks to the scene one after another and tried their best to put out the fire. By 5:00 PM in the evening, the fire gradually subsided and was extinguished. In total, more than ten thatched houses, tens of thousands of bundles of rice straw, and more than sixty rope-making machines (each worth about thirty yuan) were burned down. In addition, Yao's furniture, clothing, and miscellaneous items in his bedroom were also greatly damaged. It is said that the fire was caused by a careless worker throwing a cigarette butt into the pile of straw, causing the fire.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Minutes of the Board Meeting of the American Eastern Bank <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>At the board meeting of the American Eastern Bank on the 8th of this month, it was resolved to hold a special shareholders' meeting at the office at 29 Nanjing Road at 5:00 PM on the 18th of this month to propose an amendment to the company's articles of association. The proposal is to split each share of preferred stock and Class A common stock into five shares. The par value was originally 100 yuan in Shanghai general currency. Now, by dividing into five shares, each share will be worth 20 yuan, which is the same as the par value of Class B common stock, in order to unify the price and facilitate trading on the market. According to the recent market price of Class A common stock, which is 135 yuan, all 25,485 shares of Class A common stock and 77 shares of preferred stock will be split into smaller shares after this proposal is passed. The proposal can be implemented with the approval of two-thirds of the shareholders.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Review of Rent Reduction Movement by Tenants in Chengzhi Lane <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Wanlong Sauce Garden, Tianjitang, and five other households in Chengzhi Lane (formerly Fuxing Lane) on Moulin Street in the French Concession hired lawyer Zheng Yuxiu to sue the landlord Xia Guifang in the French Public Concession for demanding rent reduction. The court ruled to dismiss the case. The plaintiffs were dissatisfied and hired lawyer Yao Zhaodi to represent them and request a review. Yesterday, after being summoned, the lawyer representing the plaintiffs first stated that the court had not thoroughly investigated the case during the initial trial and dismissed the case, so they requested a review. Now there are four requests: (1) Reduce the rent by 30%. (2) Recover the small rent. (3) Reduce one month's rent. (4) Do not increase the rent within five years. Regarding the rent reduction, the defendant's rent is more expensive than the rent in the neighboring areas. According to the regulations for suppressing rent issued by the former Consul General Wei in Shanghai and Article 442 of the Civil Code on housing regulations, they are all contrary. As for the small rent, the plaintiffs each paid six or seven months' small rent when they moved in, which is considerable, so they requested to recover it. Moreover, the house was completed at the end of September, but the landlord actually published a notice requiring all tenants to pay rent starting from September, which is unreasonable. It is found that the land at that location covers a total of three mu, six fen, and eight li. According to the municipal price of the Engineering Bureau, each mu is no more than 35,000 taels, totaling more than 100,000 taels. The construction cost of the house is found to be made of old materials, which did not cost much. Calculating the defendant's cost, the agreed rent is too high. The court should revoke the initial trial's ruling and approve the plaintiffs' request. The defendant Xia Guifang was represented by lawyer Peng Qi, who argued that, to rent a house, one must agree to the landlord's contract terms, otherwise there is no argument to be made. When the plaintiffs rented the house from the landlord, the rent amount was agreed upon in advance, so how can they renege afterwards? As for how much the landlord's land price is, let's not discuss it for the time being. It's like I buy something and want to sell it for 10,000 yuan. If the other party doesn't want it, they can simply not buy it. How can they renege after buying it? It is found that only the plaintiffs and five others in Chengzhi Lane are opposing, and the other tenants have no objections. Why don't the plaintiffs compare with the people in the same lane, but instead compare with the houses in other places? Moreover, the plaintiffs have not paid rent since filing the lawsuit and have not deposited the rent in the bank. The request for a review is without reason and should be rejected. Judge Zhu Cheng issued an order to postpone the hearing for further review.</p>

<p>Such Wrongful Souls are Not Easily Dissipated</p>
<p>Deng Yulin, the bursar of Tongwen College on Hongqiao Road in the Shanghai West District, was suddenly hit and killed by a truck transporting bricks and tiles in front of Weile Garden on Haig Road at around 7:00 AM the day before yesterday. The news was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that the deceased was 36 years old and lived at No. 20, Lane 289, Hongqiao Road. His father died early, and his mother, Luo, is nearly seventy years old. His wife, Li, is 30 years old and has one son and one daughter. The son's name is Miaogen, who is still in infancy, and the daughter's name is Miaoying, who is only five years old. The family of four relies entirely on Deng for their livelihood, and the family is very poor. Now, unfortunately, he died in an accident, and the whole family is overwhelmed with grief. According to Lao Zhang, a small worker from Gaoyou who witnessed the incident, the deceased's head, face, chest, arms, and other places were all bluish-purple, which proved that he died of suffocation after being injured. The police have ordered the deceased's nephew, Deng Mingxiang, to prepare a coffin for burial and are not investigating the truck that caused the accident, which is difficult to accept. They now plan to petition the court for a re-examination and appeal to all parties to help redress the injustice.</p>

<p>In the midst of the appreciation of gold and the depreciation of silver, the value of imported goods is very high and the supply is gradually decreasing. Therefore, those who previously sold foreign goods now have no choice but to sell national products to maintain the market. It is now learned that the various goods produced by the Paris Cosmetics Factory in Shanghai are not only welcomed by the citizens of Shanghai, but especially by the large number of merchants from other provinces. For example, the stores in Tianjin, Hankou, Chongqing, and Guangzhou are all ordering various goods from the factory to be shipped and sold. This is truly good news for the development of national products and a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. It is hoped that the major manufacturers in Shanghai will work hard to manufacture and improve their products, so that the sales of national products will not be inferior to the exclusive beauty of the Paris Cosmetics Factory.</p>

It is truly the most abundant and complete masterpiece since the history of the Republic of China. The first volume was published not long ago and became popular for a time. Now the second volume has also been published, and the records of the various revolutionary battles described are mostly the author's participation in the work, so it is even more detailed than the first volume. It is said that the third volume will also be published soon. Recently, the Revolutionary History Editorial Office believes that all members of the National Assembly should be full of common sense about the revolution and the establishment of the country. Therefore, they have sent letters to the representatives of the National Assembly, stating that if they directly purchase the History of the Revolution from the editorial office, they will be given a 50% discount to express their welcome.</p>

<p>This was one day during summer vacation last year. At that time, Zhi and I lived together in a pavilion house in Xieqiao, living our small family-style life. We made the usual trip to the hospital every day, and spent the rest of our time in that small room. The two of us worked together for more than a month and felt much healthier and fatter than when we were at school.</p>
<p>Under this strong sunlight, we became familiar with the owner of the ice cream shop. In the evening, wearing slippers and holding a fan, we would go over to his place. After another ten days or so, we felt too bored. As a result, we made friends with watermelon for a few days to relieve our summer heat.</p>
<p>Zhi fell ill. Zhi really fell on the bed and couldn't go with me. This was my responsibility. Was ice cream and watermelon delicious?... After blaming myself for a while, I urged Zhi to seek treatment.</p>
<p>The two of us, who often gathered in one place, were as close as siblings. Moreover, Zhi was a guest here with no relatives to depend on. I felt sad for this poor person. The illness became more serious day by day. My personal ability was limited. Zhi later understood my difficulties and invited my good friend Qing from Hangzhou to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Qing was more experienced. She said that going to the hospital would be easier. Zhi reluctantly agreed. At this time, I felt like a bird out of a cage, much more relaxed.</p>
<p>Living in the hospital was so happy. The patient gradually recovered. Qing and I gradually became close to each other. Mr. Zhang once said that we were a trinity. We had already silently acknowledged it in our hearts.</p>
<p>Just as we were setting up our belongings in Ward No. 5 where Zhi was staying... The supplies from the residence in Xieqiao were gradually moved to the hospital... Unexpectedly, we had to leave it again. I was a little reluctant, but wouldn't it be too uneconomical to not live there when the illness was cured?</p>
<p>There was still a week before the start of school. Qing was about to return to Hangzhou. I suggested that the three of us take a photo together as a memento of Zhi's nursing during her illness and as a farewell to Qing leaving Shanghai. The three of us agreed and rushed to take it. At that time, the tram was on strike. Let's take a rickshaw, we got the consent.</p>
<p>I, who was the youngest but had to be someone else's elder sister, liked people calling me elder sister the most. Zhi and Qing both understood this and affectionately called me elder sister. I was happy. Having these two good younger sisters standing on both sides increased the blessings of the old elder sister.</p>
<p>Gatherings and separations are impermanent, and human affairs are ever-changing. This is really true. I haven't seen Qing for a long time. Zhi has returned to her hometown again. As for me, although I am still living a school life, the atmosphere at school has been extremely tense recently. The problem of registration. If we don't work hard and can't achieve our goal, I will have to leave these old friends and beloved Shanghai. Qing, Zhi, I miss you. Looking forward to your good news from afar, I wrote these manuscripts recalling old things in front of our group photo. Can you see them? Can you remember your old elder sister at the same time?</p>
