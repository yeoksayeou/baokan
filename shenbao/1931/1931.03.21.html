<h3>飛行界之慘劇</h3>
<p>世界航空事業日益發逹。而失事之慘劇。亦時有所聞。蓋冒險進取之心愈奮。祝險如夷。則易遇險境。此凡百事業進步之常例也。近自英國大飛船Ｒ百０一號失事。受重大損失後。各國皆知注意於預防。思所以减少以後飛行之危險。然而失事之慘劇。則仍繼續發現。如此次意國著名飛行家三軍官。由意飛往南美。突在比蕯失事慘死。亦可謂爲意國極重大之損失。故其國人哀悼之深。不减於英人前次之痛惜大飛船失事也。其次美信洋行飛機師白羅斐。駕鳳凰號由澳門往菲。在中途失踪。雖經派機四出尋覓。迄求猶無音耗。故亦已引起美人之憂慮矣。更有一可異之消息。則爲美國發覺有人謀毁海軍大飛艇是也。據電該艇阿克朗號。尙建築未竣。謀破壞者爲一匈海軍軍官。已被密探捕獲。并謂其謀如成。成則該艇落成後第一次試飛。即可墜落毁壞。其禍必有不堪設想者。事前發覺。亦云幸矣。夫以今日之航空界。正因設備之未週搆造之未精。天時變幻之無常。時生失事慘劇而慮維護防範之無術。乃竟有人惟恐其不失事。而欲以人力助成之。競爭之心熱。則一切人道皆所不顧。亦世事之可槪者矣。</p>

<h3>財政部十八年度財政報告（四續）</h3>
<p>銀價問題金銀比價兩年以來銀價跌至一半而弱十九年份慘落尤甚馴至今日銀價依然不振其結果政府商人曁消費洋貨者均受重大之影響所幸吾國民衆之用洋貨者究不甚多故雖國際銀價狂跌而國内銀幣之購買力並未過於低落然萬一年成歉收民食問題須向用金各國購進糧食方能解决則情形之嚴重將不堪設想同時此普遍的經濟衰頽設一旦漸見起色則銀價之低落反足以增進國產之輸出此則亦事實之未容忽視者銀價如此跌落世界經濟狀况又如此衰頽而銀之出產並未十分減少此因銀爲採煉他項金類時之副產品之故又歐西各國銀輔幣之成色減低印度亦採用金本位並將餘剩之銀脫售於世界用銀市塲其出售之額雖鉅而剩銀仍多又世界各國以經濟狀况不振故中國出產品之需要亦因之銳減試觀十九年份有一時期吾國竟有餘銀出口其狀况可見一斑</p>
<p>政府關於銀價問題上年曾屢向各國政府徵詢意見擬以國際合作之方法解决此項難題並願盡力贊助促成其事顧至今國際合作計劃尙未能有切實之方針如各國有切實整頓銀價辦法時吾國政府自當隨時協助其進行也現在銀價如是慘跌吾國改良幣制之需要日益顯明政府對於此事正視爲目前之一大問題</p>
<p>預算政府預算不敷實爲緊急問題十七年度（十八年六月底止）國庫短絀數逹八千萬元而創辦中央銀行所借之資本兩千萬元尙不在内十八年度（十九年六月底止）之短絀數爲一萬零一百萬元十九年度上半期（十九年十二月底止）因軍費浩繁故不敷之數更鉅僅就借欵一項而言已逹九千六百萬元十九年下半期（二十年一月至六月底）雖抵補裁厘之新稅尙未完全實行國庫擔負綦重而不敷之數可以減少以後設無意外之事故則二十年會計年度中（二十年七月一日至二十一年六月三十日止）努力爲之或能有收支兩抵之希望</p>
<p>支出之最大者尙爲軍費及債欵之還本付息欲求收支適合非減少上兩項之負擔不可查現在軍費每月直接由國庫支出者約兩千三百萬元當此共匪尙未肅清近年來吾國歷史上最激烈之戰事又甫經結束自不能將軍費立即減省然軍閥共匪勢力戢伏後軍費支出當能逐漸减輕本部之意擬照下述計劃逐期減支軍費以期逹　日决議歲支軍費兩萬一千六百萬之目的</p>
<p>二十年七月至十月　　　月支兩千萬元二十年十一月至廿一年二月月支一千九百萬元二十一年三月至六月　　月支一千八百萬元軍費以外預算不敷之最大原因爲國債還本之繁重國民政府所舉之内債多屬短期其中三萬六千萬元（約合本金全數百分之六十）須於三年之内悉數清償本年（二十年份）政府須還内債約一萬三千八百萬元外債三百萬鎊（約合國幣六千五百萬元）兩項合計約國幣兩萬萬元二十一年份應償内外債數目預計與本年同一繁重此數較已往任何年份不敷之數超出甚多即未來年份之不敷數預料亦未必如是之鉅</p>
<p>以後預算問題驟視之似甚黯淡細審之亦非無法蓋臨時借欵雖多而逐年攤還債欵之數實較新借欵之數爲多故國家之負擔非特不增反形輕减然國債之總數雖未增而借新還舊利率折扣之損失甚鉅補救之法惟有通盤計劃從長商榷籌得一種鉅額之基金將最短期之各債提先償還其較長者仍之更視其　要就籌得基金之總數發行時間較長之新公債以博内外各界投資此項新公債計劃如果實行則期間旣長每年付還債欵之數目减而預算漸可適合且有餘欵移作新長期公債之擔保爲謀建設之用如此則政府之財政愈臻鞏固各項公債之信用當益昭著政府與執券人實兩相利益也</p>
<p>綜論之以後若能相當的限制軍費支出同時發行長期公債收回短期公債並將一應稅收力圇改良三事並行政局平靖則預算不敷問題自能解决顧爲政之道非僅注力於收支兩抵而已細考吾國財政問題斷非預算適合即可引以自满不生產之費用自應節减至最低限度收支適合自爲當今急務然以吾國幅員之遼闊而第年政費値五六千萬元實祗能應付環境欲謀建設勢不可能七年以來國基奠定政權漸趨統一然民衆之期望不僅　除軍閥共匪民衆政治上之覺悟已如旭日之東升關稅自主告成厘金廢除國家生產力已不受若河束縛加之外力侵漸若世界經濟之蕭條曁銀價之慘落皆足影響民生促進覺悟民衆之仰望於政府者固不僅預算之均平也</p>

<p>接要聞</p>
<p>幣制當如何改良實業當如何振興絲茶等業當如何恢復舊觀交通綫路當如何開闻普及敎育及公衆衛生當如何提倡此尤民衆仰望於政府豈徒以收支相抵預算適合爲可以塞責者</p>
<p>政府各部曁各機關鑒於民衆對於建設之熱望有提出各種計劃者其中肯者固不少而以帑項空空能說而不能行者實居多數各個計劃復有各不相謀之慽</p>
<p>當歐戰緊張時各國鑒於生產效能之薄弱組織之散漫乃運用政府力量歸納而統一指導之大都得有相相當之成效近年來因世界經濟衰頽各國合理化之呼聲日益增高而實行此政策之最澈底者厥爲蘇俄其最高經濟委員會管理及支配全國一切生產力五年計劃之偉大程序將使蘇俄成一完全工業化之國家本黨奉總理遺敎負建國使命自當努力實際借鏡各國另組一强有力之設計機關以指導全國主產力通力合作設定計劃認清目標努力前進務使於一定時期内完成某項某項已定之計劃羣策羣力臂指相連以貫澈建設工作則僅就吾國國内之財源而論能充此項事業之用者爲數已甚鉅矣</p>
<p>總之政府預算之計劃不宜僅視爲一年度之收支統計藉消極政策减少支出使收支勉能相抵即以爲自足民志如此發揚民氣如此蓬勃嗣後預算之設非合力向積極方面鼓勇進行謀有餘力以資建設不能爲功也爰舉事實並抒所見敬祈察核財政部長宋子文</p>

<p>竊思電影事業年來日益發逹各國均異常重視之誠以此爲各種事業宣傳之最利工具其功效遠在文字語言宣傳之上我國電影事業糼稚雖有一二私家創辦者簡陋已甚竊謂當兹訓政時代建設伊始百廢待舉欲圖興辦各種事業必須先有相當宣傳則電影尙矣爰攝由中央組織中央電影文化宣傳委員會以利宣傳兹請就其功效之彰明較著者矑述如云</p>
<p>一宣傳民生主義總理致力革命事業凡四十年其目的在求中國之自由平等惟欲逹到自由平等之域非得民衆先安居樂業不可故總理獨見之明首重民生惜宣傳之力不廣以是未能普及而近年國步多艱民生日　無業之徒或入軍旅或爲流寇以維殘命輾轉禍國擾亂良民使有業者亦不能安居陷國家於杌隍之境此其原因皆爲不講民生主義之故以是治本之計一方宜盡力宣傳民生主義一方應以實施民生主義之主法指示人民衣食住行必如何實施而後人民始有幸福庶幾學理與事實並重易於推行然我國民衆科學智識淺薄而又方言各異若恃文字宣傳旣患不能普及使全民百分之九十五不識字者全能了解若恃講演宣傳則有言語杆格之弊然則如之何而後可曰惟有藝術化科學化之電影宣傳能使民衆感受最深刻之印象收效易而且速廣而且宏可使無業之遊民咸知謀生之樂趣有業之良民安居而樂業蓋能收濳移默化之功於無形中也</p>

<h3>肺癆病原菌脫蠟術新發明</h3>
<p>（一）（由最近德國結核雜誌編譯）自考克博士發見結核菌爲肺結核症（即肺癆病）之病原體以來。東西結核學者爭先研究。欲期得一殺滅此菌之妙方。但其結果盡歸失敗。蓋因歷來一般之醫家。因未明瞭肺結核菌之别具一種特殊性構造。以爲凡爲病菌。盡可以消毒之藥劑。用内服或注射之方法撲滅之。一如六０六之注射於梅毒也。自柏格爾博士ＤrBergell苦心研究後。始發表肺結核菌有一種特殊之防禦力。能抵抗一切外來藥力之攻擊。蓋肺結核菌體係中性脂肪之内膜及抗酸性蠟質之外膜Lipoid所構成。若非設法破壞其蠟質之防線及解除其脂肪性之武裝。則無由俘擒結核菌而置之死地。且結核菌龔入人體局部時。其四週即被侵蝕。而形成頑强之結節。以阻礙血流之通過。致使注射或内服之一般消毒藥劑。無由越雷池一步。宛如特别戒嚴之禁區藝力旣無從接觸患部。則雖溺沉全身於樂池中。亦不能傷結核菌之毫髮。是以撲滅肺結核菌之唯一作戰方略。至少必須具備下列之兩種先决條件。（一）凡樂力能破壞結節而直逹患部者。（二）又能　奪或溶解其蠟質及脂肪性之内外膜者。如此始能奏破關斬將之功。否則隔靴搔癢。彼結核菌且在此兩種保障之下。竊笑人之莫余害也。</p>
<p>（二）曾有哈莫塞哈黎Hammersehaly及提禮潘斯基Terebensky氏等。發現結核菌之酸性。係因蠟質能抗酸而然。遂應用五乃至一０％之苛性加里液。而得除去結核菌之抗酸性蠟質。後有莫純Moussn及高披爾Goupjl兩氏。應用鹽素瓦斯。而亦得除去抗酸性蠟質。然此種脫蠟法。祇能適用於顯微鏡檢查上染色法而已。蓋其藥性劇毒。對於人體終不能實用也。</p>
<p>近數年來。偶有將大楓子油應用於痲瘋症。而獲意外之奏效者。蓋痲瘋菌與肺結菌爲同性質之抗酸菌。而大楓子油能有脫蠟之作用。兼具石炭酸百倍以上之殺菌力。於是一般學者。遂引起狂熱的注意。思以大楓子之油。應用於結核症患者。冀圖奏效。乃用種種之化學的方法。提出大楓子油之主要成分。然祇限於皮膚及表在性結核症。能奏良效。而對於深部的臟器。如肺臟。肝臟。腎臟等結核。則仍不能奏何等之效果。</p>
<p>（三）因此我普天下結核病者之大恩師柏格爾博士。百尺竿頭。再進一步。搜集動植礦物性各種樂物。而苦心研究。期得一種有脫臘作用。而無大楓子油之種種缺點者。孜孜數十年。不知絞盡幾許腦汁。瀝瀝幾許心血。以求其最合理最純粹的化學劑不已。終發見特殊動物之腸間膜腺壓縮汁中。有某一種有效成分。對於結核菌有强力脫蠟之作用。乃即將此新成分作用於結核菌。而行基兒加排特氏Ziehigabett染色法。則已不染紅色。而染青色。此項結果。與他　非抗酸菌完全相同。自此東西醫家所視爲人工不能除去結核菌抗酸性之主張。完全推翻。而占脫蠟殺菌劑中之最高權威。遂將此化合物實驗於動物及人體之各種結核症。均得偉大之神效。並無副作用。此實前後千古醫學界一大疑問的肺結核治療新曙光也。</p>
<p>（四）肺結核之病原及病理旣閘明後。柏格爾大醫聖發明这肺結核治療上理想的新醫理。亦實驗而大功告成。二十世紀唯一無二之肺結核特效藥三那星Sanosin遂遵此新醫理新學說而產生。開醫學界一未有之新記錄。兹將三那星所含有之主要成分。臚述於下。</p>
<p>第一成分之化學名Aminoaethyisulfonsaeure（C2H7Nso3)係由特殊動物之腸間膜腺肝臟。及海中軟體動物之血液中提取製出者也。其化學性質。無色透明。爲有光輝之四出或六出形結晶。在攝氏十二度。能溶解於十六倍之冷水。於熱湯更易溶解。但不能溶解於無水酒精及依的兒内。如以强鹽性液煮沸之。則成醋酸及亞硫酸。與水銀溶合時。則形成不溶於水之白色粉末。倘於攝氏二百四十度分解。而加以數倍之炭酸曹逹。更細密混合。加熱於白金板上。則生殘塊。據修例德博士。DrSchroder之實驗報告。謂此種成分。能施直接作用於結核菌。而溶解其外膜之蠟質及脂肪質。結核菌旣失去此險要之屏藩。遂不能免避其死刑。抑尤有進者。此種成分。且有一種相當之刺激性。能使患者之胆汁增加其分泌量。且新陳代謝之機能。愈形旺盛。對於肺病　。則又能變化其結締織。而奏治療的效果。）第二成分係提曼博士DrTiemann創製之KaliumSulfoguajacolicumG6H3(CH(OCH)2SO2OK其功用能增進結核患者之抵抗力。及血清之凝結力。促進新陳代謝。增加白血球。防止結核菌之發育。有健胃袪痰消毒之特殊作用。故自現代著名結核大醫萊享白哈博士GrReichenbach提倡應用於肺結核以來。德英諸國醫家莫不以此成分奉爲治撩結核症之無上聖品。</p>
<p>（五）綜合以上二大寳責之主要成分。而製成三那星新藥。故三那星爲肺結核治療上空前絶後之特效新藥。確有極大之價値。兹舉其醫治作用於下。（一）設於試驗管中。實驗（三那星）之藥力作用。則一分鐘後。結核菌皆消失其抗酸性。至三分鐘後。則此肺結核菌。完全殺盡。無一倖免。（二）以内服或注射之方法。應用三那星於人體。則能滲入於肺臟等各臟器内部。迄十八小時後。檢查小便。則能發見ＤＩＡＺＯ之反應。於四十八小時後。此反應即行消失。而白血球非常增加。（三）依動物試驗。則發見（三那星）能滲入結核病　内。設檢查其病　内潛伏之結核菌。則盡</p>
<p>失其抗酸性。此足證明其蠟質之完全溶解矣。（四）内服（三那星）約一星期左右。則可見咯痰之稀釋。體熱之下降。及心身愉快等之狀態。（五）更繼續内服（三那星）逹一二個月以上。則顯見體重增加。食慾激進。一切症狀。逐漸緩和。終逹其回天再造之偉功。</p>

<h3>英領贊成租界禁絶賽狗</h3>
<p>自利南復工部局函</p>
<p>字林報云關於禁絶跑狗事昨日（十九）</p>
<p>工部局又與英總領事往返函商一次白</p>
<p>利南總領事復函表示工部局决意禁絶</p>
<p>界内跑狗深爲英當道所贊同英公使意</p>
<p>見常謂辦理此類事件乃工部局之職責</p>
<p>邇來有爲跑狗場張目者揚言此項賭博</p>
<p>爲英國法律所許可渠對此一點雖不</p>
<p>欲於此際表示意見但據聞近日英國法</p>
<p>庭所審案件未嘗有證明跑狗賭博爲合</p>
<p>法者此外英國殖民地之香港與新加坡</p>
<p>俱未准許跑狗亦一大可注意處英當道</p>
<p>對於工部局努力肅清界内商業性質之賭</p>
<p>博甚表同情而跑狗場之所爲久已非</p>
<p>所贊成且尤不願見英人利用治外法權</p>
<p>而有妨害工部局行政之行爲接照洋涇</p>
<p>浜章程取締公衆娱樂場所乃工部局權</p>
<p>限内事工部局旣以良好理由拒絶發給</p>
<p>執照於跑狗場倘此時决定勒令停閉則</p>
<p>英公使亦認此種舉動甚有益於租界者也</p>

<p>先生以民力爲之之舉無論集資艱難障礙層</p>
<p>出亦且枝節自爲工作計畫不能統一已覺非</p>
<p>法况復經種種之妨害折挫致成今日之局面</p>
<p>以余之見宜有下之數種辦法(一)國家籌集鉅</p>
<p>欵將沿海未築之堤築成應建之閘建成應開</p>
<p>之幹河開成人民之享有水利者俟其開墾成</p>
<p>熟或另徵工程費用或升科後帶徵工程費用</p>
<p>人民旣享其利然後分成輪將是爲統籌全局辦</p>
<p>法人民得墾植之利公欵有歸還之時此爲最</p>
<p>上策(二)如鉅欵難籌得浩大之工程不及辦則</p>
<p>仍就各公司之現狀分别予以經濟援助派員監</p>
<p>督欵勿虚糜務使其未竣之工程完竣其援助</p>
<p>欵項寛以年限分期收回是爲因勢利導辦法</p>
<p>各公司前功不致盡棄後效自有可觀此爲次</p>
<p>策(三)如國家此時無暇及此則肅清盗匪使其</p>

<h3>世界小事記</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>▲波斯國内。凡是男子。以笑爲可恥。因爲大家以爲笑是屬於女性的。所以他們逢了要笑的時候。往往强制着不笑。但是婦女却可以任意嬉笑。並無顧忌。</p>
<p>▲南非洲東面的馬逹加斯加島Madagascaro是法蘭西的殖民地。島中以絲綢爲最低廉的衣料。所以一般最窮苦的婦女。也穿着綢衣。</p>
<p>▲近年以來。明信片風世界。而最初用明信片的。却是奥大利國。</p>
<p>▲非洲撤哈拉大沙漠SaharaDesert中的沙。平均深約三十英尺。</p>
<p>▲據英國某博物家研究所得。一個蚱蜢。能比它身體的長度跳到二百倍遠。一個蜘蛛每天所吃的東西。比它的身體重二十七倍</p>
<p>▲英國北面的埃斯蘭lceland島中。男子們相見時。有彼此接吻的風俗。但他們難得和婦女們接吻。</p>

<h3>煤山軼聞</h3>
<p>— 清癯</p>
<p>三月十九。爲明思宗殉國煤山之日。舊歷已廢。則日是與三月廿九日七十二烈士。黃花岡之革命同。憶昔人紀念思宗。而託之爲太陽誔。故其經首曰太陽明明朱光佛。可以知已。</p>
<p>人第知甲申。闖賊入西安。將度河時。督師剿賊者有李建泰。思宗親至正陽門。把琖語之曰。先生此去。如朕之行。詎未幾。兵即折回。自是相繼失守者。不特平陽太原。而平壹之一席話。閹宦杜勳。已輸誠於賊。而畿輔之臣如魏藻德等。乃束手無言。熊袁死後。可謂朝無一人。故思宗臨殁。有君非亡國之君。臣乃亡國之臣者。即指此也。</p>
<p>壬午後。北兵至河陽。不待西寇内犯。而京師已危。所恃以捍禦者。唯一京營。且人數不足。而都城女牆。多至五萬四千餘奇。上知無以守。乃令各監局掌印以下之太監。不論老小。悉引之登陴。久之。因無炊竈。所謂守兵。皆離防地覔食。而叛閹如曹化淳。早與賊通氣。縱有勤王之師。亦不能保尺士。而况無一能提兵以趨者耶。</p>
<p>萬歷間。賦稅已重。民間苦之。而崇禎末。昔之遼練剿各餉。俱無以催比。甲申元旦。諸臣以防邊費重無著奏上。咸以内帑請。上頗難之。旣乃泫然泣下。嗣召户部侍郎吳履中。詢庫内有現銀否。曰。僅八萬耳。無已。勸朝右助餉。嘉定伯周奎。且爲周皇后父。厚資獨擁。不名一錢。思宗以微詞諷后。后傾宮中所貯以與奎。俾體上意。詎奎復吞其半以進。然有一老翁。年已六十餘。未始有朝廷一命之榮。獨痛哭以血汗所積之四百金。解囊輸之。謂無一愛國者。亦豈確論。噫。此吾所以讀明史最末之一頁。而不能已於辭也。</p>

<p>有悲女塵果可悲。聰明見賺誤佳期。人間的有眞情種。恨不相逢未嫁時。</p>

<h3>童軍黨義演說記</h3>
<p>— 葉華女士</p>
<p>蓋聞英將貝敦堡創童子軍也。原重　士兒童國民訓練。吾國童軍始自之民二。兹受黨之指導。於國民訓練目標。益見努力。滬市童軍於總理忌日舉行首届黨義演說競賽會。是乃吾國黨童軍空前之盛舉爰撮一二見聞。以留鴻爪。</p>
<p>▲王潔之急　中學組優勝第一名。係女童軍王潔。誠吾國自民五辦女童軍來之新紀元。主性活潑。好動而不好静。演說次序依報告先後。而王之演說適排人最末。王覩同志一一登壇。彼則秋水望穿。偏不輪値。一種杌隍不安性急不堪之情狀。宛若虎初入　。先手足無所措。繼血液上升。满面通紅。終將口喃喃發詞。余坐其側。瞻其急。亦代之急。心甚忐忑俟評判結束。王竟名列前茅。至此吾人始恍然悟王潔之急非無因也。</p>
<p>▲黃衣心理　攝影畢。有人詢某童軍何故頭戴黃帽。身穿黃衣。一身所有。幾皆黃物。某云。色之偏愛。各以民族個人而異。光帶之紅黃端。人每愛之。黃爲光帶最顯明之色。令人活動鼓舞。吾國專制時代平民尙紅。貴族尙黃。黃尊於紅。天子衣。曰黃袍。詔書以黃紙傳鈔。名黃榜。天子經過之地。舗黃土。其居上自瓦下至墊。莫不用黃。洎乎清代。甚至國旗亦黃。宗室皆繫金黃帶。大臣服黃馬褂。可謂黃之極盛時期。又古綠衣黃裳。譬妾貴妻賤。尊卑倒置。尊哉黃色也。無怪童軍之愛黃。然童軍之黃。並無貴族或述信意。惟採取其活動鼓舞。藉此努力奮發耳。</p>
<p>▲紀律如鐵　競賽分圑體與個人。圑體本定每團童軍選代表二人參加。乃此項規定在章程中被手民脫落。補救之道。惟發通告。詎知通告應選代表二人。又誤書二人爲限。與原意逕庭。而事前口頭上之報告。以二人爲標準。但有一部分未之前聞。故爲圑體出席者一人二人皆有。兹事遂快於評判會。結果根據文字。蓋所謂二人爲限。意參加者至多二人。一人可。三人則不可。好在一人分數。有幸有不幸。殊甚公平。於是一人得允代表團體。評判終結。某組團體優勝者爲一人代表。二人出席者不免怏怏。雖然。惟有服從議决案。無一間言。如此紀律。値得讚賞。查競賽塲無謂之爭。中外皆然。已成司空見慣。此次競賽有可爭之隙。而安然不爭。深足表揚童軍之美德也。</p>
<h3>書樊樊山</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>樊樊山先生。於本月十四日逝世。天不憗遺。凋殘耆舊。詩宗一代。銷歇風流。鳥呼傷已。先生爲京華寓公者有年。百魔蜩沸。政亂似麻。先生獨與羅瘿公·易龍陽諸子。載酒題襟。澹然忘世。及羅易先後赴玉樓。先頗有寂寞寡侣之感體本清健。奈年來漸現衰邁这態。客嵗。偶啖馬打滚而病。馬打滚者。爲贛地之食品。法取糯米粉蒸而熟之。使之團　成餅。俟其乾硬。然後和水煑之。及糜爛而止。謂之粢巴。别取糖霜豆麥粉。盛之以盎。栥巴投入盎中。糖霜豆麥粉。則自然黏附。啖之甘芳可口。名之爲馬打滚者。取其形如也。顧衰邁胃弱。滯而不化。爲之困頓奄臥者多日。於是外間遂有先生作古之謠海外東坡。傳聞失實。先生一笑置之。先生風情綺豔。雖晚年尙喜作香　之吟。大有却扇一顧。傾城無色之槪。蓋其傳情如繪。讀之合人銷魂蝕骨也。我友徐子枕亞。欽其詩才。以師禮事之。時海上風靡詩謎之戲。枕亞常往推敲。一日。謎條爲樊山詩什。枕亞固熟誦其什者。乃下注。并移他人之注而集中焉。及揭發。果爲枕亞所中。獲四百金。一時傳爲佳話。張丹翁前輩。藏有先生所貽之小影一幀。會蒙見示。貌癯而莊。正衣冠而足登厚底朝靴。大約乃　昔服官遜清時所攝。先生之案牘書札。早已刋行。遺詩三萬餘首。不久當有爲之付梓行世者。當民國初元。先生常以詩什付諸報章附刋。予亦愛讀先生之詩者。見輒錄存之。至今旅篋中尙有一二鈔本。均先生之佳構也。先生逝世。亨年八十有六。</p>

<p>夫人諱縑。字韻緗。姓王氏。先世浙江山陰人。清嘉道間客湘。遂流寓長沙。考諱本昌。妣童太君。太君早寡。有子女二人。鞠育敎誨。動循禮法。夫人糼隨母待養玉母。以孝聞顧擇配嚴。年二七。始歸元倐爲繼室。元倐家世寒素。不事生產。自光緒壬寅游學日本歸。慨念國事阽危。創設明德學校。自是二十餘年。恒奔走在外。終歲不一歸。即歸席不暇暖。皇皇有求。門以内事。悉委夫人。不復過問。夫人處之晏然。雅性高絜。惡衣菲食。屏絶僕嫗。從容操作。室鮮蓋藏匱不時告。而事無弗舉。戚黨饋遺。必稱以周。元倐得壹意興學。而人亦以元倐舉室蕭然。能自刻苦者。夫人之賢也。夫人無世俗好。惟嗜讀書。日手一編。至忘寒暑。所作詩詞駢體文。多可存者元倓嘗錄爲晚晴集一卷。又有手書訓子遺言數則。根據道德。通逹事理。語多可法。晚年奉佛。性益岑寂。沈默寡言。雖體羸多病。輒諱疾戒無擾。今夏先湘亂數日以微疾逝。時元倓方客京師。阻亂不獲歸視。傷哉。夫人生於清同治癸酉年八月二十八日。卒於民國庚午五月五日。年五十有八。字三。牧留學日本慶應大學。得經濟學士。娶張氏。毅留學美國芝加哥大學。得敎育博士。娶帥氏。徵隷業國立音樂院。聘陳氏。孫女一。是年仲冬戊申葬於長沙大賢鎭師古籌之原首乙趾辛。銘曰。</p>
<p>猗嗟淑儷。實我良友。處如静女。勞如　婦。儉而中禮。質有其文。吐詞成章。載揚清芬。如何一旦。泊焉永寂。匪値亂離。寗知佛力。瑤華閟采。清瑟遺音。式兹貞珉。悠悠我心。</p>
<h3>旅歐漫談（六）</h3>
<p>— 汪亞塵</p>
<p>此館法國名家製作中。可以特别記載者。即薛望Chavannas的四幅大壁畫。嵌入三層樓扶梯旁之四壁。每幅長約三丈。闊五丈餘。不但描寫結實。材題方面。亦極有意義。第一幅是希臘時代。描寫古希臘藝術盛期的景象。後景都用希臘神話中之人物作背景。第二幅是羅馬時代。描寫羅馬盛期的光景。　以雄壯之羅馬建築。畫中人物皆裸體。一種融融然享樂於自然的陶醉。表顯無遺。第三幅是宗敎時代。描寫宗敎藝術盛期之光景。一羣敎徒在敎堂製作壁畫。令人喚起當時對宗敎之誠虔。畫中建築。全用羅馬式之環門。一見即知羅馬宗敎時代之偉大。這三幅壁畫。作於一八八五年。沿門尙有一幅。描寫人類始祖之亞當夏娃。拼成對模形之裝飾圖案。色彩及構圖。煞費經營。上述四幅。實爲薛望平生之精品。從薛望之壁畫左首進内。陳列一大間文藝復興以後及至十八世紀末葉意大利及法國之繪畫。計百餘點。其中有幅勞勃司蒂的裸婦。其手法傅色。極似鐵青。Tition此爲該室意大利畫中最優之傑作。除此以外。所陳意國之畫。皆非精品。其中有幾幅法國大畫家之臨摹作品。頗有記述之必要。一。馬内Manet臨特拉克華Delacroix之但丁小舟。原晝二百號。陳列於巴黎羅佛館。馬内僅用六號海面畫幅。但其大部分之感覺。都能表出。二。特拉克華臨谷婁其Correge之聖像圖。原作八十號人物。亦陳列在巴黎羅佛館中。特氏以五號之小幅臨其大體人物衣冠。悉皆與原畫感覺無異。手法之老到。用色之深刻。都無懈可擊。三。特拉克華臨鐵青之名作耶蘇下十字架圖。畫幅僅六號。却不失鐵青原作之精神。歐洲已往各大畫家。在探索時期。皆徘徊於巴黎羅佛美術館。對古代大家作品。作深刻的研究。以前臨畫者。僅照原作的大體而運用自身的技術。按照此法摹寫。確於自身的技術有極大收獲原來自身技術的根本條件已經解决的作家。臨摹古畫時。决不會被原作迷惑住的。余見馬内與特拉克華之模寫畫。覺得臨畫的工作是有意義的。參觀樓上繪畫後。再至樓下。見陳列雕刻品。共十餘室。意大利名雕及翻印品頗多。雖不及意大利雕刻之名貴。但足可供　美術者研究之用。復由雕刻室登樓。見陳列現代法國作品。凡巴黎著名畫家之作。每人皆有一二幅陳列。該館至中午例須閉門。參觀至此。時近正午。未及一一記錄。出館仍乘車回至英國旅館近處中餐。餐後。沿河畔遊覽。河之後景靠山。兩岸植木整然。遠望山聞。屋字鱗比。其繁華不亞於巴黎。河中所行船隻。較巴黎賽納河中尤多。蓋其地商業繁盛。運轉亦較熱閙。在河　行四五里。旋回旅舍。略事休息。乘下午三時十四分之特别快車回巴黎。</p>

<h3>法將福煦歐戰日記（續）</h3>
<p>— 顧昂若譯</p>
<p>二日三日兩夜比較的岑寂三日德軍自覺虚弱開始有秩序的向頁普里斯砲擊這是他們在這種情形下的慣事餘時他們祗能進行局部的攻擊並無效果四日戰况也是一樣</p>
<p>現在可說他們向頁普里斯的會攻已告失敗他們的軍隊軍火雖則遠過聯軍他們的奮鬥遇着聯軍的石壁已告瓦解他們不能繼續奮鬥了德軍參謀部不得不收縮其野心</p>
<p>敵人覺得不能以全線總攻推翻聯軍的防寨更不能佔領頁普里斯的重要中心以直搗海岸因之他現在想改攻我們防線的凸角的兩個樞柚其一在頁普里斯之北其一在頁普里斯之南</p>
<p>敵人所想得着的戰略上的勝利雖没有成功但是他至少再可在法蘭特以戰術的勝利鞏固其西綫的陣地轉而攻俄</p>
<p>他可以不必佔領頁普里斯而逹到這個目的因爲向凸角的兩端進攻可以使他調動砲隊逼近南北兩面阻碍我們以頁普里斯爲中心的交通迫脅我們的軍隊從半圓形陣綫撤退</p>
<p>這樣在城東激戰之後兩軍又將在其南北兩面交戰了</p>
<p>自五日始　人得着一個生力師的增援就在我們向梅新内斯前進的時候向韋斯基的南面大舉進攻在北面敵人的第三後備軍團順利的向俾斯曲和郎基馬克開戰敵人餘部則不見活動</p>
<p>十三日頁普里斯之戰終了德軍的攻擊南北兩樞抽以揻凸角促成兩次大戰相持數日不分勝負</p>
<p>十一月十八日兩軍各歸原防陣綫完全穏定</p>
<p>戰事旣息我們立刻乘機改編軍隊總司令調到大批援兵使我們頗易着手</p>
<p>我們多數的兵士已陷於進退維谷的境地他們的更替迫不及待了我現在開始與法蘭樞總指揮談判前綫的劃分和聯軍的配置從長計議了數日我們對於各軍負責防守的戰區逹到了同意</p>
<p>因爲我們仍舊不能確悉敵人的情形我們因此常用飛機和騎兵偵察敵人是否有退却的行動我們且請求但基克的海軍當局偵察紐埠北面德軍沿海岸的砲台的位置幾次偵察我們始悉敵人的戰壕築得很固處處遇著步槍和砲擊海軍的偵察不敢冒險到預防比潛水艇的水雷區域</p>
<p>德軍大體是乎固守陣地牢不可破</p>
<p>聯軍在法蘭特作戰歷時甚久戰區很廣參戰的軍隊份子複雜人數不甚衆多常常開到遲緩且易混雜在這樣錯綜複雜的情形之下非有統一的指揮根據大綱明察形勢進行混戰則勝利實無把握猶有一件其功不可磨滅的就是聯軍間和各軍司令問的最有效力的聯絡這不過是聯軍的合作精神的另一表現</p>
<p>聯軍司令常能在日裏互相見面我在每天晚上請杜白將軍來到宛馬特討論我們的軍事和預備翌日的命令他的司令部設在魯斯布路治十點鐘左右亨利感爾遜爵常常帶了聖亞美英軍總司令部的戰報來到加塞爾我的司令部並且報告法蘭樞總指揮翌日的計劃我們與佛爾内斯的比軍司令部也是息息相通</p>
<p>我們的英國聯軍的能團結始有實力的格言在從前大約没有更像這次一心一意的合作的完全實行過這就是以弱敵强相持一個足月終歸勝利的秘訣</p>
<p>我自然常與我的總司令有密切的接觸我雖從十一月二日以後没有見他我們天天交換意見他雖則始終承認法蘭特戰事的重要他未能立即派遣充分的兵力他的軍隊經過兩月的激戰已是精疲力盡他們又缺乏軍火况且他更不得不鞏固虚弱的陣線戰線展開甚速到現在從伏斯基斯到雷斯河戰線長至三百七十五英里</p>
<p>戰綫的範圍這樣廣闊兩軍處處接觸甚近每處都有龔擊的可能這此事實就是援軍絡絡續續開到參加頁普里斯戰爭的原因他們也就是參戰的軍隊須長期作戰的原因只因爲並無别的軍隊可供替代但是他們在全部惡戰裏仍能不屈不撓實屬難能可貴現在二個例予可以證明</p>
<p>英國第一軍團自從十月三十一日以後歷受巨創那天牠且已開始退却但是牠停止了回去再戰奮勇百倍敵人一再猛擊均未得手最後敵人確被遏制了然後在十一月十八日離開戰塲</p>

<h3>Tianjin Waterworks Workers Decide to Implement a Slowdown</h3>
<p>The Company Calls an Emergency Board Meeting. The Tianjin Waterworks Union held a press conference at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 20th to report that the company had refused the workers' demands and did not recognize the union.

The company convened an emergency temporary board meeting at 3:00 PM to consider recognizing the union as a legal organization and to discuss the conditions put forward by the workers. Unfortunately, the union had already decided to implement the slowdown, making it difficult to reverse the decision. (20th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Tragedy in the Aviation World</h3>
<p>The world's aviation industry is developing rapidly. However, tragic accidents also occur from time to time. The more adventurous and enterprising one is, the more likely they are to encounter dangerous situations if they treat danger as if it doesn't exist. This is the usual course of progress for all undertakings. After the British airship R.101 crashed, resulting in significant losses, all countries knew to pay attention to prevention and to think about how to reduce the risk of future flights. However, tragic accidents continue to occur. For example, the recent tragic deaths of three Italian military officers, famous aviators who were flying from Italy to South America, in an accident in Pisa can also be said to be a major loss for Italy. Therefore, the depth of mourning of its people is no less than that of the British people in the previous grief over the airship crash. Second, the American Crichton Airplane Co. pilot, Bai Luofei, disappeared en route from Macau to the Philippines in the Phoenix. Although aircraft were dispatched to search in all directions, there has been no news. Therefore, it has also aroused the concerns of Americans. Even more bizarre news is the discovery in the United States of a plot to destroy a naval airship. According to reports, the airship Akron is still under construction. The person plotting the destruction is a Hungarian naval officer who has been captured by secret agents. It is said that if his plan succeeds, the airship could crash and be destroyed on its first test flight after completion. The consequences would be unimaginable. It is fortunate that it was discovered beforehand. In today's aviation world, which is already fraught with tragic accidents due to inadequate equipment, imprecise construction, and the impermanence of weather, and where there are concerns about the lack of means to maintain safety and prevent accidents, there are people who fear that accidents will not happen and want to use human power to make them happen. The enthusiasm for competition is so great that all humanitarian concerns are disregarded. This is a comprehensive reflection of the state of the world.</p>

<h3>Seiyukai Launches Final Massive Attack</h3>
<p>Motion of No Confidence Proceeds to Agenda</p>
<p>Chorei Explains Reasons for Motion</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 20th: This afternoon's session of the House of Representatives, due to the motion of no confidence being placed on the agenda, commenced at 1:20 PM. At the sound of the bell, members of both ruling and opposition parties entered the chamber with tense expressions. The gallery was also silent. Prime Minister Hamaguchi entered with a vigorous stride and was greeted by clapping from his party members. After taking his seat, Speaker Fujisawa announced the continuation of the morning session and the alteration of the agenda to include the motion of no confidence proposed by the Seiyukai. There was no dissent. Advisor Chorei Tokonami of the Seiyukai, dressed in an elegant kimono, ascended the podium to applause from the opposition. Chorei, in a clear and eloquent tone, delivered a speech on the motion of no confidence. The entire chamber listened in solemn silence. Prime Minister Hamaguchi, seated in the ministerial seats, also leaned forward to listen. Chorei stated that the current cabinet, without adequate preparation, rashly implemented the gold standard and forced the people to practice erroneous consumption savings, leading to industrial stagnation, widespread unemployment, and a general economic downturn. In foreign affairs, under the guise of international cooperation, the foundation of national defense was endangered. Many of the so-called grand policies promised to the people have been abandoned. The cabinet clings to power, disregarding the fundamental principles of constitutionalism and failing to fulfill its responsibilities. Prime Minister Hamaguchi should immediately declare his intention to resign and retire to a quiet place to reflect and seek to renew the hearts of the people and restore the light of politics. He thoroughly criticized the reasons for the motion of no confidence from various angles.</p>
<p>Negotiating Parties Reach Compromise</p>
<p>Discontent Among Anti-Executive Faction</p>
<p>Seiyukai Exposes Weakness</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 20th: Yesterday's negotiating parties, representatives of the Seiyukai, Secretary-General Mori and Director-General Shimada, agreed on the following compromise proposal, seeking approval from the members' meeting: (1) At the plenary session on the 19th, Speaker Fujisawa reported that Prime Minister Hamaguchi could not attend, and the Seiyukai withdrew its questioning. (2) Regarding the discussion of supplementary budgets, the Minseito and Seiyukai parties are each limited to one speaker. (3) The Horse Racing Law Amendment Bill and the Makino Bill will be reviewed by the committee on the 19th and immediately placed on the agenda for the plenary session, followed by deliberations on other government bills. (4) The motion of no confidence proposed by the Seiyukai will be placed on the agenda for the plenary session on the 20th.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 20th: The negotiating parties have reached a compromise. The Seiyukai held a secret members' meeting at 8:00 PM last night, where strong voices of discontent were raised against the arbitrary actions of the executive. The reasons for opposing the compromise proposal are threefold: (1) The executive's acceptance of this humiliating compromise is due to the lawsuit filed against Secretary-General Mori and Director-General Shimada by the Minseito Party. (2) The Minseito and Seiyukai parties have already reached an agreement that Prime Minister Hamaguchi will attend and answer the Seiyukai's questions. There is no reason for a compromise now, which is inappropriate. (3) If the Seiyukai shows weakness at the plenary session on the 19th, its momentum will be greatly reduced when the motion of no confidence is placed on the agenda, making it difficult for Chorei to speak forcefully from the podium. The most important reason is the long-standing discontent towards Secretary-General Mori and Director-General Shimada, which has surfaced through the opposition to the compromise proposal. In short, the Seiyukai completely exposed its disunity and internal turmoil last night, which is likely to continue.</p>
<p>Supplementary Budget Passed by Vote Overnight</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 20th: Due to the compromise reached between the Minseito and Seiyukai parties, the plenary session of the House of Representatives on the 19th did not reconvene until 11:00 PM late at night. Following a motion by Sakuta of the Minseito Party, each supplementary budget bill was put to a vote, resulting in unanimous passage.</p>

<h3>Remnants of Pinghan Railway Bandits Fleeing Eastward</h3>
<p>Xu Yuanquan Supervises Suppression of Communist Bandits in Western Hubei</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondent: Since the Bian and Han Headquarters dispatched troops to encircle and suppress the bandits along the Pinghan Railway, the situation has stabilized in recent days, and the damaged bridges and roads are gradually being repaired. Commander-in-Chief Chiang, in order to ensure the permanent safety of the railway, specifically ordered the Kaifeng and Wuhan Headquarters to divide and guard the railway, and dispatched four artillery trains to patrol between Guangshui and Zhumadian to ensure thoroughness. The task of searching and suppressing the remnants of the bandits is the responsibility of Li Mingzhong, the Pacification Director of the Henan, Anhui, and Hubei border areas. The Wuhan Headquarters has transferred the First Aviation Team stationed in Hankou to dispatch several fighter planes daily to conduct reconnaissance to the north. If Communist bandits are discovered, they will be bombed at any time. After receiving the orders, the Bian and Han Headquarters made separate arrangements. Liu Zhi, Director of the Bian Headquarters, arrived in Xinyang on the 15th and returned to Bian on the 16th. Before leaving, he ordered Zhao Guantao and Yuan Ying to maintain close contact. Yesterday (the 18th), he also appointed Zhang Fang as the Commander-in-Chief for suppressing bandits in Southern Henan. All units of the 20th Route Army and the units of Zhao Guantao and Wan Dianzun are under his command and will depart immediately to supervise the suppression. He Chengjun, Director of the Wuhan Headquarters, ordered the troops stationed in the southern section of Wusheng Pass to thoroughly defend the area, and assigned Xiao Zhichu and Luo Zhuoying to carry out the search and suppression. He also ordered He Jingwu, Director of the Pinghan Railway Bureau, to expedite the repair of the tracks and bridges so that traffic can be restored as soon as possible. It is reported that the Communist bandits, due to the concentration of large forces in the southern section of the Pinghan Railway, fear being surrounded and have turned eastward. The leader of the bandits is unknown, but it is heard that Kuang Jixun is among them, perhaps the main force of the bandits. Director Li Mingzhong has taken a plane to Beijing to ask Chairman Chiang for instructions on everything. After returning to Hankou, he will depart to the east of Hubei to supervise Ji Hongchang and other units to encircle and suppress the bandits. In the western Hubei area, after Xu Yuanquan took office as the Director for Suppressing Bandits and Clearing Villages, he divided and dispatched troops to thoroughly suppress the bandits, and divided the responsibility for various areas with the Sichuan Army, Guo Xun, the Hunan Army, Li Jue, and the Guizhou Army, Luo Qijiang.

They are currently besieging Tiao Guan near Shishou, and the navy has dispatched the Jiangxi, Xianning, and Desheng ships to assist in the search and suppression. Xu departed from Shashi on the 16th to inspect the troops in the Shishou and Hao Xue areas, urging them to advance bravely and set a deadline to recover Tiao Guan and eliminate the remaining bandits.

<h3>Zhu Peide Inspects Troops in Bengbu</h3>
<p>Review of the 45th Division Stationed in Bengbu</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondent: The Central Government, in order to reorganize the military and government and assess the strength of each division and brigade, has specially dispatched Chief of Staff Zhu Peide to inspect the troops stationed along the Tianjin-Pukou and Longhai Railways. The inspection team was first organized to prepare everything. Wu Qingzhi, the director of the first inspection team, Fan Yuying, the director of the second inspection team, and the inspection commissioners arrived in Bengbu at 3:30 PM on the morning of the 18th, crossing the Yangtze River from Nanjing by the second-class train on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. Wu Qingzhi, along with the members of the first inspection team, Jin Jifang, Shen Zheng, Zhang Yazhun, Liu Fu, Zhang Pengwan, Zhang Zaiqin, and their attendants and escorts, disembarked and stayed at the Transportation Villa on Er Ma Road. Fan Yuying and others did not disembark and went to Xuzhou to inspect the 7th Division. Wei Lihuang, commander of the 45th Division here, had already received orders from the headquarters and concentrated his troops in Bengbu ten days ago to actively prepare. Director Wu informed the division headquarters last night of the schedule for inspecting the division. On the first day (the 19th), from 8:00 AM to 10:00 AM, the division's troops stationed in Bengbu will assemble at the airfield for a military parade.

At about 8:00 AM, he went to the Xiaoshan South Airfield for a military parade. The 45th Division dispatched troops to distribute posts along the way with strict security. (March 19)</p>
<h3>The Termination of the Taiyuan Headquarters</h3>
<p>Establishment of a Termination Office to Handle the Closure. Li Fuying to Leave for Shenyang Within Days to Urge the Allocation of Funds. Taiyuan Correspondence: After the cancellation of the Jin-Sui Garrison Headquarters, it was proposed to establish a Jin-Sui Military Termination Office to handle the closing affairs of the headquarters. However, this matter is of great importance and must be approved by the Northeast before it can be started. The army commanders had sent a telegram to Deputy Commander Zhang with the agreed results and the proposed plan for instructions. They received a reply expressing agreement. Therefore, Xu Shang, Yang, and others decided at a headquarters meeting on the 13th to officially establish the Jin-Sui Military Termination Office on the 15th of this month. The original eight departments of the headquarters were reduced to eight groups: Chief of Staff Group Lian Zhuangqiu, Chief of Military Affairs Group Fu Penghai, Chief of Military Supplies Group Guo Dianping, Chief of Ordnance Group Zhou Weihan, Chief of Military Medicine Group Bo Guitang, Chief of Military Law Group Lang Fenggeng, Chief of General Affairs Group Gao Guancheng, and Chief of Telecommunications Group Zhai Xiushan. After deducting the monthly expenditure of 80,000 for councilors, the original budget for the eight departments of the headquarters was approximately 30,000. This would be reduced by two-thirds, resulting in a monthly expenditure of slightly over 10,000. However, it is said that the chiefs of the Military Supplies and Military Affairs groups are unwilling to take office. The position of director has been decided as Shi Rongxi. The affairs handled by this office are limited to all matters that should be terminated, and they will not be involved in matters concerning various troops or military institutions. Furthermore, as this office is of a short-term nature, no new seal will be made, and the old seal of the Jin-Sui Garrison Commander will continue to be used for official documents. It is reported that the pre-scheduled time limit is three months, during which all termination matters will be completed and then the office will be abolished. If it cannot be completed by then, it may be extended for one or two months before being canceled again. Regarding the issue of funding allocation, Shang Xu, Yang, and Li Fuying, along with Fu Zhan魁, Men Zhizhong, and others, had a long discussion at the Shanxi Grand Hotel on the evening of the 14th. It was decided to send Li Fuying to Shenyang to meet with Zhang in person to present the actual difficulties of the Jin faction's military pay situation and urge the allocation of funds. Currently, the Jin faction's military pay has only been paid up to November of last year, with arrears reaching four months. A large sum of money is urgently needed to facilitate demobilization. According to Li Fuying, the generals have completed the inspection of their respective units and recommended him to go to Shenyang to request demobilization funds from Zhang. He decided to leave Taiyuan within three days. He also stated that the inspection of the troops stationed in northern Shanxi by Ji Yiqiao had yielded excellent results. Ji expressed that Deputy Commander Zhang would, of course, be responsible for the issue of military pay after this inspection and demobilization, and asked all generals, officers, and soldiers to rest assured.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Deputy Commanders Xu and Yang sent a telegram to all units, ordering them to quickly prepare rosters of demobilized officers and soldiers and report the total amount of arrears in pay in order to expedite the allocation of funds. The telegram stated: It has been found that the arrears in pay for December of last year and January and February of this year for various departments and battalions had previously been ordered to be allocated by the Bureau of Provisions. However, due to insufficient funds, it has not been possible to allocate the full amount in a timely manner. However, the demobilization of troops has been completed, and it is inappropriate for demobilized officers and soldiers to remain for long waiting for pay. The following measures are now stipulated: (1) The total amount of arrears in pay for each month for the demobilized officers and soldiers of each unit should be telegraphed immediately in order to instruct the bureau to expedite the allocation. (2) The arrears in pay for the remaining officers and soldiers retained will be collected after the first item has been completed. In addition to sending separate telegrams, it is hoped that you will investigate and handle this accordingly without delay, as this is extremely important. (March 16)</p>
<h3>Shandong Businessmen's Federation Petition Regarding Business Tax</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Shandong Provincial Businessmen's Federation specially convened a meeting in Jinan for the implementation of the business tax by the provincial government. Yesterday (the 17th), the chairman of the Businessmen's Federation, Xin Zhujiu, representative of the Yantai Chamber of Commerce, Lin Songpu, chairman of the Zhoucun Chamber of Commerce, Li Huafeng, representative of the Linqing Chamber of Commerce, Lu Jiting, representative of the Yidu Chamber of Commerce, Ma Fangchuan, representative of the Heze Chamber of Commerce, Ma Shiyin, representative of the Boshan Chamber of Commerce, Xiahou Hongru, representative of the Ziyang Chamber of Commerce, Zhu Xinqing, went to the Finance Department to meet with Director Wang Xiangrong and deliver a petition regarding the collection of business tax, putting forward three requirements: (1) The total tax should be paid once a year, with shops divided into levels but goods not divided into levels. (2) If goods must be divided into levels, please reduce the categories (such as the business tax rate proposed by Shandong, where goods are divided into five categories for taxation, please reduce it to three or two categories). (3) The collection procedure should be simple, and it is best for the county governments or finance bureaus to collect and remit to the provincial treasury without setting up separate bureaus to avoid harassment. Wang Xiangrong expressed that the three requirements were difficult to implement and could not be approved. The representatives of the Businessmen's Federation also requested: (1) Those who pay consolidated tax should not pay business tax again. (2) Handicrafts such as straw hats and braids should be taxed lightly and not listed as luxury goods. (3) The collection procedure should be as simple as possible. Wang expressed that the latter three requirements could be discussed and said that the implementation of the business tax was just beginning, and it was difficult to estimate how much could be collected. It was estimated that the annual amount would be about 5 million yuan. The government sympathized with the difficulties of businesses and would not cause any harassment. The Businessmen's Federation has now closed its meeting and has appointed the petition representatives to be stationed in Jinan to study the business tax issue. The petition is recorded as follows: It has been found that the implementation of hidden levies and the implementation of business tax to make up for the accumulated malpractices of a hundred years. Once exempted, it is indeed pleasing to businessmen. I would like to offer the Director my humble opinions: (1) Handicrafts should be taxed lightly. My country's handicrafts are the source of livelihood for the poor. For example, hairnets, lace, and embroidery are all handicrafts. They are luxury goods domestically, but trade with foreign countries requires encouragement of exports, and customs duties have always been exempted. Therefore, the business tax rate should be determined lightly. (2) The collection procedure should be simple. The disadvantage of the former Likin was that there were numerous bureaus and cards, and the procedures were cumbersome, which was inconvenient for businessmen. The collection of business tax should be corrected. It is best to set up as few bureaus as possible and to be lenient in inspection. Harassment is worse than heavy taxes. For example, in matters such as checking accounts, the types of goods in a store often differ, and the tax rates are different. If it is necessary to classify and carefully seek it, it will inevitably be impossible to cope with and the burden will be unbearable. Therefore, the tax audit should be based on the main points and not be harsh, so as to prevent abuses and conform to the business situation. (3) Goods that have already been collected with special tax should be exempted. If special tax is levied again, it is double taxation. For example, coal in Boshan is a necessary commodity, and wine in Yantai can resist foreign wine. All have special taxes and should not be taxed again, depriving people of their needs and benefiting the infusion of foreign wine. I have stated above whether it is appropriate to ask your hearing to review and adopt it. It is for the public convenience.</p>
<h3>Postponement of the Northeast Party Committee Inauguration</h3>
<p>Due to personnel adjustments, it is necessary to wait for the central government to announce. Shenyang Correspondence: Since Wu Tiecheng arrived in Shenyang, he has discussed with Deputy Commander Zhang the steps for implementing party affairs in the Northeast and Zhang has appointed Peng Jiqun, Director of the Construction Department, and Zhu Guangmu, Director of the Northeast Telecommunications Administration, to be responsible for the preparations. At that time, Peng went to Tianjin to attend the North China Water Conservancy Commission. After Wu电促to return to Shenyang, he began to prepare with Zhu Guangmu and Wu Tiecheng actively guided the process. It was originally planned to establish the Liaoning Provincial Party Department on the 14th of this month. At the same time, the Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Rehe, and 哈 各 provincial steering committees 集 in Shenyang to take office and then go to the provinces to carry out party affairs. The Northeast provincial and district party committees were designated by the central government as early as 1929. Over the past two years, personnel changes have been made. After consultations between the central government and the Northeast, it was decided to make slight adjustments to the provincial committees. This procedure must be announced by the central government before the committees can officially take office. On the 12th, it happened to be the anniversary of the death of the Premier, and the Central Executive Committee was adjourned. Therefore, it is necessary to wait for the regular meeting on the 19th to submit and issue an order before the oath of office can be scheduled in Shenyang. The Liaoning Provincial Party Department will be established. The steering committees of the Jilin, Heilongjiang, Rehe, and 哈 各 provinces and districts will remain for observation for two or three days before going to the provinces and districts to prepare for the establishment of party departments. Wu Tiecheng will successively go to Jilin, Harbin, Heilongjiang to inspect the provinces and districts before returning to Shenyang for a short rest and then go to Beiping to transfer to Rehe to inspect. The number of committee members in each province and district is set at seven for Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe, and five for the 哈 特区. (March 16)</p>
<h3>The Eighteenth Annual Financial Report of the Ministry of Finance (Continued 4)</h3>
<p>Silver Price Problem The gold and silver parity has fallen by half in the past two years, and the dismal fall in 1929 was even worse. Even today, the price of silver is still sluggish. As a result, the government, merchants, and consumers of foreign goods are all greatly affected. Fortunately, not many of our citizens use foreign goods, so although the international silver price has plummeted, the purchasing power of domestic silver coins has not fallen too low. However, in the event of crop failure, the problem of food supply must be solved by purchasing food from gold-using countries, and the situation will be dire. At the same time, once this widespread economic decline gradually improves, the low price of silver will instead increase the export of domestic products. This is also a fact that cannot be ignored. Silver prices have fallen so much, and the world economic situation is so depressed, but the production of silver has not decreased significantly. This is because silver is a by-product of refining other metals. In addition, the fineness of silver coins in Western countries has been reduced, and India has also adopted the gold standard and sold the remaining silver to the world silver market. Although the amount of sales is huge, there is still a lot of surplus silver. Moreover, due to the economic downturn in various countries, the demand for Chinese exports has also been sharply reduced. Looking at 1929, there was a period when our country actually had surplus silver exports, which shows the situation.</p>
<p>Regarding the silver price problem, the government has repeatedly consulted with the governments of various countries last year, intending to solve this problem through international cooperation, and is willing to do its best to promote it. However, to date, there is still no practical plan for international cooperation. If various countries have practical measures to rectify the silver price, our government will assist in its implementation at any time. Now that the silver price has fallen so badly, the need for our country to improve its monetary system is becoming increasingly obvious. The government is paying attention to this matter as a major problem at present.</p>
<p>Budget The government's budget deficit is an urgent problem. In the 17th year (ending June 1928), the treasury deficit reached 80 million yuan, and the capital of 20 million yuan borrowed for the establishment of the Central Bank was not included. In the 18th year (ending June 1929), the deficit was 101 million yuan. In the first half of the 19th year (ending December 1929), the deficit was even greater due to high military spending. The amount of borrowing alone reached 96 million yuan. Although the new taxes to offset the abolition of Likin in the second half of the 19th year (January to June 1931) have not been fully implemented, the treasury burden is heavy, and the deficit can be reduced later. If there are no unexpected accidents, it may be possible to achieve a balance between revenue and expenditure in the 20th fiscal year (July 1, 1931 to June 30, 1932).</p>
<p>The largest expenditures are still military expenses and the repayment of principal and interest on debts. To achieve a balance between revenue and expenditure, it is necessary to reduce the burden of the above two items. Currently, the direct military expenditure from the national treasury is approximately 23 million yuan per month. At a time when the communists have not yet been eliminated and the most intense war in our country's history in recent years has just ended, military expenditure cannot be reduced immediately. However, after the suppression of warlords and communists, military expenditure can be gradually reduced. The intention of this department is to gradually reduce military expenditure in accordance with the following plan in order to achieve the goal of reducing annual military expenditure to 21.6 million yuan as resolved by the 日:</p>
<p>July to October of the 20th year: Monthly expenditure of 20 million yuan November of the 20th year to February of the 21st year: Monthly expenditure of 19 million yuan March to June of the 21st year: Monthly expenditure of 18 million yuan</p>
<p>The biggest reason for the budget deficit other than military expenditure is the heavy burden of repaying national debt. Most of the domestic debt raised by the National Government is short-term, of which 360 million yuan (approximately 60% of the total principal) must be repaid in full within three years. This year (20th year), the government must repay approximately 138 million yuan in domestic debt and 3 million pounds in foreign debt (approximately 65 million yuan in national currency), totaling approximately 200 million yuan in national currency. The number of domestic and foreign debts to be repaid in the 21st year is expected to be the same as this year. This number exceeds the deficit of any previous year by far, and the expected deficit in future years is not expected to be as large.</p>
<p>Looking at the budget problem in the future, it seems very bleak at first glance, but it is not impossible to solve if you look closely. Although there are many temporary borrowings, the amount of debt repaid annually is actually greater than the amount of new borrowings, so the national burden is not only not increasing, but is actually decreasing. However, although the total amount of national debt has not increased, the losses from borrowing new to repay old debt interest discounts are very large. The only way to remedy this is to plan comprehensively and discuss it in the long term, raise a large fund to repay the shortest-term debts in advance, and maintain the longer-term debts. If necessary, new public bonds with longer issuance times can be issued based on the total amount of funds raised to attract investment from home and abroad. If this new public bond plan is implemented, the number of debts repaid annually will be reduced, and the budget can be gradually adjusted. Moreover, there will be surplus funds to transfer as collateral for new long-term public bonds for construction purposes. In this way, the government's finances will become more stable, and the credit of various public bonds will be more obvious. The government and bondholders will benefit from each other.</p>
<p>In summary, if it is possible to reasonably limit military expenditure in the future, while issuing long-term public bonds to recover short-term public bonds, and improve all tax revenues, and the political situation is peaceful, the budget deficit problem can be solved. However, the way of governing is not only to focus on balancing revenue and expenditure. Looking closely at our country's financial problems, it is not enough to be satisfied with just balancing the budget. Non-productive expenses should be reduced to the minimum. Balancing revenue and expenditure is the urgent task at hand. However, given the vastness of our country's territory, the annual government expenditure of 50 to 60 million yuan can only cope with the environment. It is impossible to seek construction. Since the foundation of the country was laid and the political power has gradually become unified in the past seven years, the expectations of the people are not limited to 除军阀共匪. The political awareness of the people has risen like the sun rising in the east. Customs autonomy has been achieved, and Likin has been abolished. The country's productivity is no longer restricted. In addition, foreign aggression and the world's economic recession and the tragic fall in silver prices all affect people's lives and promote awareness. What the people look forward to from the government is not just a balanced budget.</p>

<p>How should the monetary system be improved? How should industry be revitalized? How should industries such as silk and tea be restored to their former glory? How should transportation lines be opened up and popularized? How should education and public health be promoted? This is especially what the people look forward to from the government, and it cannot be evaded with just a balance between revenue and expenditure and a balanced budget.</p>
<p>The government's various departments and agencies, in view of the people's eagerness for construction, have put forward various plans. Many of them are certainly worthwhile, but most of them are just talk because of empty coffers. Each plan also has the sadness of not being coordinated with each other.</p>
<p>When the European War was tense, various countries, in view of the weakness of production efficiency and the disorganization, used government power to summarize, unify, and guide it, and most of them achieved considerable results. In recent years, due to the world's economic recession, the call for rationalization in various countries has been increasing, and the country that has implemented this policy most thoroughly is the Soviet Union. The great program of the Supreme Economic Council's management and control of all national productive forces in the Five-Year Plan will make the Soviet Union a completely industrialized country. Our party is entrusted with the mission of building the country according to the Premier's will, and we should strive to learn from other countries and form a strong and powerful design agency to guide the country's main productive forces to cooperate, set plans, identify goals, and strive forward. We must complete certain planned projects within a certain period of time. Everyone should work together and connect our arms and fingers to implement construction work. Then, just in terms of our country's domestic financial resources, the amount that can be used for this cause is very large.</p>
<p>In short, the government's budget plan should not only be regarded as an annual revenue and expenditure statistics, and it should not be considered self-sufficient to reduce expenditure with a passive policy so that revenue and expenditure can barely be balanced. The people's aspirations are so developed, and the people's morale is so vigorous. After that, the budget should not be bravely promoted in a positive direction to seek surplus power for construction. I have cited the facts and expressed my views respectfully. I hope you will observe and verify them. Minister of Finance Song Ziwen.</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>The case of building a memorial monument to Premier Sun has been determined. The Ximen Yuecheng base was previously requested by the people to be designated as the site for building the memorial monument to Premier Sun by the County Party Department. The County Government decided to collect a small part of the camp site led by private individuals on the base for public use at public expense. Wu, the landlord, filed a lawsuit in the Civil Affairs Department requesting the cancellation of the County Government's disposition. Various organizations once convened a meeting presided over by the County Government to discuss the design drawings and planned to slightly move the memorial monument to the south of the road to show consideration for Wu's houses to avoid demolition. The Construction Bureau drew up the drawings, prepared a budget, and submitted them to the Construction Department for verification. It is now learned that the Construction Department has issued instructions to the county that the relocation of the memorial monument to the south of the road is disrespectful and should be based on the entire planning and construction of the Yuecheng base. The grassy area next to the center is connected by a bay-shaped road, and the houses that should be demolished are indicated clearly in red lines on the original drawing. The Civil Affairs Department also approved the order to the county to comply with the order and rejected Wu's appeal. The case has come to an end. It is now heard that the County Government will convene a land acquisition review meeting in accordance with the order of the department, and the Construction Bureau will also correct the points in accordance with the order of the department and redraw detailed drawings and budgets to be submitted to the department for approval before workers can be recruited for construction.</p>
<p>A fraudster impersonating an official was arrested and brought to Songjiang. Zhang Yishi, a native of Zhuanqiao, is nearly thirty years old and has been a teacher. Recently, he suddenly claimed to be the second director of the Reconnaissance Team of the Jiangsu Civil Affairs Department in various townships in Songjiang and Qingpu counties, such as Fengjing, Fanbang, and Xinzhen. He wore a badge with the above title (made of pure gold) and widely recruited reconnaissance team members at a price of 70 yuan, granting them a card with the front printed with the Songjiang-Qingpu County Reconnaissance Certificate and the official seal of the Civil Affairs Department. The reverse side was printed with the words "Second Branch of the Reconnaissance Team of the Jiangsu Civil Affairs Department," with the member's name stamp below. He often carried two letters with him, one from Niu Yongjian, the former Minister of Internal Affairs, stating that he was young and capable and could join the Civil Affairs Department. The letter stated that a certain security group had suspected connections with bandits and had been sent to the Civil Affairs Department for verification, signed and sealed. The other was a letter from the First Section of the Fourth Division of the Secretariat of the Provincial Government, with a message from the Chairman inviting him to come to the government to meet and talk on a certain day. Those who were keen on official careers were all shocked. Yang Shijie, an inspector of the Public Security Bureau of the county, discovered the situation and immediately reported to Director Shen that the Civil Affairs Department had not heard of this organization and had not issued any orders. Whether this was impersonating an official or defrauding money, an investigation should be made immediately. Yang was ordered to investigate the school. When he was selling long hair in Jia, he saw that the surname Zhang had been rewritten on the license plate, which was already suspicious, so he interrogated him and searched all the above exhibits one by one, and brought them back to the Public Security Bureau for questioning.</p>
<p>The permission to set up an office across the border has been ordered to be revoked. The Xinzhuang Town Chamber of Commerce has repeatedly requested the National Chamber of Commerce to forward letters to negotiate because the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce set up a branch office in Qibao Town across the border. After failing to obtain results, they submitted a request to the County Government to submit it to the Provincial Government to negotiate with the Municipal Government. It is now learned that the Chamber of Commerce has received instructions from the Provincial Department through the County Government stating that it has approved the Municipal Government's consultation and reply. According to the previous request from the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, the instructions were issued with the approval of the Bureau's original proposal. Before Qibao's administrative takeover, it can temporarily retain its old way of handling matters. In addition to distributing it to the Social Affairs Bureau to order the cancellation, the consultation and review will be conducted. It is heard that the Chamber of Commerce will send personnel to Qibao to take over.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>A grocery store in Kaiyuan Township was robbed by thieves. The Jiang Shunji grocery store in Helukou, Kaiyuan Township, was suddenly attacked by more than 20 thieves speaking with northern accents at around 1:00 am yesterday (the 20th). They broke into the house and searched everywhere, taking about half an hour before they looted and whistled away. By the time the 9th branch of the Public Security Bureau learned of the alarm and sent police, the thieves were far away. The total loss of silver, foreign goods, and goods was estimated to be worth more than 500 yuan.</p>
<p>The department ordered a thorough investigation of the tea guest donation. Qian Zhongliang, the head of the first district of Wuxi, previously intended to organize a tea guest donation of one copper coin for each tea in order to raise autonomous funds because the autonomous funds were severely short. Although the restaurants had been notified, it was not implemented because it had not been approved by the superior authorities. However, Wang Debiao and other representatives of tea houses in the city submitted a letter to the Finance Department requesting the cancellation of the original plan. The Finance Department based its presentation on the fact that there was no record of this tea donation. If the presentation was true, it would inevitably be close to harsh levy. Yesterday, a special order was issued to the County Government to investigate and reply.</p>
<p>The murderer in the Qitai Inn case was arrested. Xiang Afu, a cook at the Qitai Inn on Tongyun Road outside Guangfu Gate, was killed after an argument with Gu Ar'er over the collection of a cigarette holder and 15 copper coins. Gu Ar'er was able to escape. It is now learned that after the case occurred, Gu Ar'er was able to escape. It is now learned that after the case occurred, the murderer Gu Ar'er escaped to the Guanyintang in the Cypress Bridge, Tu 583, Jingyun City, outside the East Gate, intending to evade punishment. The incident was discovered by the kitchen owner Xiang Deyu, who personally went to the countryside to trick Ar'er into the city and sent someone to guard him. That night, the head of the township, Meng Yangsu, and the deputy head of the township, Guo Xinliu, believed that Xiang Deyu was also related to the case and intended to settle it privately in the township. However, because the murderer's family was very poor, there was no result. At 4:00 pm yesterday, the family of the deceased decided to report to the County Court for an autopsy. Upon receiving the report, the Prosecutor's Office immediately sent Prosecutor Du, along with the coroner Shen and bailiffs, to the mortuary of the Inn Industry Association for an autopsy.

<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Another kidnapping case occurred near Cuiqiao. Sun Xichang, a resident of Sunjiatang in the 5th district of Wuyi, about five miles away from Cuiqiao Town, has been a chef in Shanghai. Only his wife and a three-year-old child were left at home. The situation was not very wealthy, but the houses they lived in were quite magnificent, which was coveted by bandits. At 1:00 am on the 17th of this month, more than a dozen thieves knocked down the iron door and entered the house, robbing Sun's wife's bedroom and Sun's younger brother Shanchang's house one after another. Unsatisfied with what they had obtained, they kidnapped Sun's three-year-old child and left. Before leaving, they instructed them to prepare 40,000 yuan within three days and send it to 圩　for redemption. At that time, Tian Huo Wang Laosan stepped forward to stop them and was injured by the thieves.</p>

<p>Regular Convocation of Eight Counties Pacification Conference</p>
<p>The first regiment commander of the Provincial Security Corps stationed in Cheng, and concurrently the commander of the Su-Chang Pacification Sub-district, Zhu County, has scheduled a joint meeting on the 28th of this month at the Guan Yue Temple regimental headquarters on South Street, Jiangyin. The meeting will include all district commanders of land and water military police from Wu County, Wujiang, Kunshan, Qingpu, Changshu, Wuxi, Wujin, and Jiangyin. The command headquarters has prepared proposals and distributed them to the eight counties. Excerpts are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) It has been found that the recent bandit intelligence reports and the actual status tables of armed groups in various counties under the district have often not been submitted on time to the headquarters, making it impossible to clearly understand the recent situation in each county. It is requested that they be submitted by a specified date for assessment.</p>
<p>(2) Any scattered bandits in each county that can be captured and eliminated by the police and militia forces of the county should be strictly searched and arrested by order of the county government within a specified time, and dealt with according to law to eradicate the root cause.</p>
<p>(3) If a large group of bandits suddenly appears in any county, the county government should handle the situation based on the bandit situation, and promptly report the details to the headquarters for verification.</p>
<p>(4) During the pacification period, all armed groups in the district should conduct mutual sentry duties daily. In case of bandit activity, in addition to making every effort to suppress and eliminate them, they should also promptly inform friendly forces to assist in the suppression. If a bandit alert occurs in County A, County B, which is connected, should also be notified for assistance in the suppression, so as to avoid the problem of suppressing them here while they flee there. However, a report must be submitted to the headquarters for record afterward.</p>
<p>(5) During the village cleansing period, private possession of firearms or bandit weapons by civilians should be thoroughly investigated and reported to the headquarters by the county government for submission to the Superintendent's Office for verification.</p>
<p>(6) In areas where traffic is inconvenient and bandits roam, the district office, defense corps, and public security bureau of each county should seriously urge the public to organize civilian sentries to report bandit activity and military liaison matters. If the public in the area fails to comply, they should be punished by military law.</p>
<p>(7) The command headquarters should send a letter to the provincial party headquarters to instruct the party headquarters of each county to organize propaganda teams to promote the benefits of pacification and village cleansing to the public.</p>
<p>(8) If a county or armed group fails to assist when a neighboring area experiences a bandit alert and requests assistance, resulting in an accident, it will be considered as aiding the bandits once verified by the headquarters.</p>
<p>(9) The county where pacification and village cleansing have been completed should report to the headquarters for submission to the Superintendent's Office for record.</p>
<p>(10) All bandits and communists in each county should be thoroughly eliminated within two months.</p>
<p>(11) In counties within this pacification sub-district where there is no bandit disturbance, all armed groups should be instructed to assist the village cleansing bureau in carrying out village cleansing immediately.</p>
<p>(12) During the pacification period, each armed group should report the process of bandit suppression and assistance in village cleansing in detail at any time.</p>
<p>(13) All attending agencies are requested to submit proposals for discussion to ensure thoroughness. Please decide whether this is appropriate.</p>
<p>Past Years' Accumulated Grain Depleted</p>
<p>After the establishment of the Jiangyin Granary Management Committee, it took over the public funds and property management register. Since the implementation of accumulating money instead of grain in Jiangyin, the granary households have stored grain for many years. Upon verification of the original accumulated grain funds, it was found that there was no surplus left in the register. The previous committee was also unable to take over. A total of 104,540 yuan, 2 jiao, 7 fen, and 1 li were found to have been misappropriated. The committee resolved to send the register with the committee's endorsement to the county government for verification and handling.</p>
<p>Election of President and Vice-Presidents of Relief Center</p>
<p>Since the Relief Center was reorganized into a committee system for receiving and organizing, the committee of the center requested the county to officially appoint a president and vice-presidents in accordance with the regulations promulgated by the ministry the other day. County Magistrate Li has now appointed Cao Yuanmo as president, and Zhang Chengshu and Chen Xiaoqing as vice-presidents. Xia Juemou, Zhu Danqing, Qian Hanwu, Gong Yinggeng, Wu Shuying, and Xie Youtao are appointed as fund management committee members and have been reported to the Department of Civil Affairs for record.</p>

<p>Peng Yunhui's Malfeasance and Fraud Case</p>
<p>Peng Yunhui, the former captain of the Detective Team of the former Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau, was accused by the parties in the Wang kidnapping case in Dongxiang of fraud and dereliction of duty. He was sentenced to three months in prison by the court. Peng appealed to the High Court, which changed the sentence to four years. He appealed again to the Supreme Court, which reduced the sentence to two years. Peng still refused to accept the sentence and filed an extraordinary appeal, which was sent back to the Suzhou High Court for retrial. The sentence was changed to one year and two months, and the complainant was refunded 656 yuan. Peng has been involved in this case for a long time and has stated that he will accept the sentence and wait for execution.</p>
<p>Establishment of the Journalists Association</p>
<p>The Zhenjiang journalists initiated preparations to establish the Journalists Association because the Jiangsu Provincial Party Headquarters recently issued organizational guidelines for the establishment of journalists associations in various counties, which were limited to this month. The preparations have now been completed, and a permit has been issued by the county party headquarters. Therefore, a founding meeting was held at 2:00 PM yesterday in the auditorium of the county party headquarters, and executives were elected. Thirty-seven members attended. Yao Qisu, a representative of the county party headquarters, provided guidance, and Xu Baqun, a representative of the county government, supervised the election. Wang Zhenxian was elected as the temporary chairman by public recommendation. After the ceremony, ballots were cast to elect executives. As a result, Guan Qizi, Tong Xiping, Wang Shaoxian, Tang Zhenqiu, Jiang Xiaochen, Dai Biao, and Dai Jiesan were elected as executives.

<p>A Fire Caused a Loss of Nearly a Thousand Gold</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, two children were playing with fire in the Zhu Bajun area south of the Longwang Temple in Matang, when a fire suddenly broke out. At that time, the east wind was strong, and the fire spread to the houses. In an instant, eight or nine thatched houses were reduced to ashes. It is reported that the loss was about eight or nine hundred yuan.</p>
<p>Scheduled Collection of Banquet Donations</p>
<p>In order to compensate for education expenses, the Bureau of Education once drafted regulations for the collection of banquet donations in accordance with the methods of Wuxi and Nantong counties and submitted them to the county government for submission to the Department of Finance for verification. Subsequently, the Department of Finance submitted it to the 375th meeting of the provincial government, which decided to approve it.

<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Provincial Government Protects the Fishing Season Along the Coast of Jiangbei</p>
<p>Due to the rampant pirates along the coast of Jiangbei, the provincial government believed that the fishermen did not dare to go to sea during the current fishing season. Representatives were sent to the province to petition. The representatives have now returned to Nantong. The province has indicated that it will work with the Superintendent of Pacification to protect the fishing season along the coast of Jiangbei. The matter involves military plans and cannot be disclosed.</p>
<p>Difficulty in Increasing Taxes on Enclosed Land Along the River</p>
<p>The Provincial Government Committee decided to increase taxes on enclosed reed fields along the river in Tongyi, following the example of Changshu. Jiang Yongyi was appointed to handle the matter in Nantong. Commissioner Jiang arrived in Nantong and, together with the county government, surveyed the fields. Due to the collapse of the reed fields in the northern part of the enclosed sea sand area, it was not possible to proceed as planned and a report was submitted to the province for verification.</p>
<p>Relief for the Severe Collapse of the Riverbank</p>
<p>The collapse of the riverbank in Tongyi has become increasingly severe recently. The disaster victims along the river have appealed to the province and county for relief. Currently, the urgent task is to build a retreating bank and a healthy retaining wall, which will cost 300,000 yuan. The provincial government has decided that the province and county will each bear half of the cost. The Bank Protection Committee has continued to report to the provincial government, requesting that a special commissioner be sent to Nantong to manage the county funds. The county funds are insufficient, and it is requested that some of the 40% of Zhang Jian's confiscated property be allocated to facilitate progress.</p>
<h3>Huzhou</h3>
<p>Henan Residents Beat and Injure Villagers</p>
<p>Around 1:00 PM on the 15th of this month, in the Nanyang Dou area of Shanlian Town in the southeast of this city, a group of itinerant residents from Henan, led by Ren Hesan, drove more than 300 yellow ducks into the fields. Farmers such as Pan Shirui were working in the fields and, fearing that the ducks would harm the spring flowers, advised them to stop. Ren held a grudge against Pan and gathered forty or fifty vagrants who were living in the area. Each of them carried hoes, wooden sticks, and other implements and rushed to the village. Without asking any questions, they beat the villagers indiscriminately, injuring many. They also tied up the villagers Pan Yatou and Shen A'duo and beat them severely in the thatched shed where the itinerant residents lived. When the villagers saw this, they reported it to the village chief, who informed the Shanlian Town Defense Corps and requested that they send a team to suppress the violence. Chief Zhang of the corps personally led more than ten militiamen to the thatched shed, rescued the injured Pan and Shen, and took Ren Hesan's brother, Ren Awu, and a worker to the Wu-Xing Local Court for investigation yesterday.</p>

<p>Resolution of the Case of a Female Student Injured by a Car</p>
<p>Chen Yuxi, a student at Jinan Provincial Women's Middle School, was injured by a military vehicle No. 6 while lining up to attend a meeting on the anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death. Because the car owner firmly refused to admit responsibility, the education community launched a public appeal to the party and government authorities, making six demands. After Director of Education He Siyuan returned to Jinan on the 16th, the car owner admitted to injuring the student, and the matter is expected to be resolved peacefully. The student has been discharged from the hospital and returned home, but she is still mentally distraught.</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang's Remarks on the Change of Presidents at Tsinghua University</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency)</p>
<p>The change of presidents at Tsinghua University has attracted much attention. Yesterday, Chairman Chiang made the following remarks to a reporter about the approval of the resignation of former President Luo Jialun. The record is as follows:</p>
<p>President Luo has achieved remarkable results in running Tsinghua University. Not only has the university's affairs improved day by day, but everything has been done in accordance with the principles of our party and the policies of the central government. He has made great efforts to rectify the academic atmosphere and unify thought. When the reactionary forces of Feng Yuxiang were rampant, President Luo worked hard in the north to uphold justice and to make students understand right and wrong and the location of obedience. This was particularly appreciated by the central government. Therefore, although Luo repeatedly requested to resign since last year, the government earnestly persuaded him to stay. During the spring, I personally urged him to return to the university to preside over it in Hankou twice. Later, the central government decided to appoint him as the director of academic affairs of the Central Political School. The Central Political School is very important to the party and the country. All comrades in the central government believe that it is essential to have someone as loyal, hardworking, knowledgeable, and experienced as Comrade Luo to take on the role. In fact, it was difficult to balance both roles. Therefore, his resignation was finally approved at the State Council meeting and Wu Nanxuan was appointed instead. President Wu is loyal and sincere, and the affairs of Tsinghua University will surely develop along the right track. The report in the newspaper yesterday that I met with students on Tuesday and that the conversation did not match the situation at the time is inaccurate. The government can consider the wishes of the students if they are reasonable, but the government will naturally make the final decision on the selection and appointment of personnel.</p>

<p>8. All expenses of the committee shall be raised by the Central Government.</p>
<p>The Origin of the Creation</p>
<p>The Central Film Culture Propaganda Committee was proposed by Mr. Li Yiyuan, Dai Ce, and Wang Shilian, graduates of the National Conservatory of Arts and Crafts in Paris, France. The proposal was submitted by Central Committee members Wu Zhihui and Chu Minyi and passed by the Central Political Conference. The origin of the creation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>It is believed that the film industry has developed rapidly in recent years, and all countries attach great importance to it. This is indeed the most effective tool for propaganda for various undertakings, and its effect is far above written language. Although China's film industry is still young, and there are one or two privately run enterprises, they are very simple. It is considered that in this era of political tutelage, with the beginning of construction, and with the abandonment of various undertakings, if it is desired to promote various undertakings, there must first be considerable propaganda, then film is still necessary. Therefore, it is proposed that the Central Government organize the Central Film Culture Propaganda Committee to facilitate propaganda. The more prominent of its effects are described as follows:</p>
<p>1. Propagandizing the Principle of People's Livelihood. Dr. Sun Yat-sen devoted himself to the revolutionary cause for forty years. The purpose of this was to seek freedom and equality for China. Only when the people have first settled down and are able to live in peace can they reach the realm of freedom and equality. Therefore, Dr. Sun Yat-sen's unique vision places primary importance on the people's livelihood. Unfortunately, the strength of propaganda was not widespread, and as a result, it failed to become popularized. In recent years, the country has faced many difficulties, and the people's livelihood has become increasingly difficult. The unemployed have either entered the military or become bandits to maintain their lives, causing disasters to the country and disrupting the good people. Even those who have businesses are unable to live in peace, placing the country in a dangerous situation. The reason for this is that the Principle of People's Livelihood is not being discussed. Therefore, the fundamental solution is to make every effort to propagandize the Principle of People's Livelihood on the one hand, and to instruct the people on how to implement the Principle of People's Livelihood in terms of food, clothing, housing, and transportation so that the people can have happiness. It is hoped that theory and practice will be equally emphasized to make it easier to promote. However, the scientific knowledge of the Chinese people is shallow, and dialects vary from place to place. If we rely on written propaganda, we are afraid that it will not be popular, so that 95% of the people who are illiterate will be able to understand it. If we rely on lectures, there will be the disadvantage of linguistic barriers. So, what can be done? Only artistic and scientific film propaganda can make the deepest impression on the people, with easy, fast, broad and宏 effects, so that the unemployed vagrants all know the joy of earning a living, and the good people with businesses live in peace and enjoy their work. This can achieve the effect of潜移默化 in the invisible.</p>

Shu Hongyun, the coach of our Chinese team, is well-prepared. At that time, we will show our Chinese power and resist the strong momentum of the enemy. Then there will be a third and final game. Unfortunately, if the United States wins again, the championship will go to the United States. Last year, the China Underwear Company donated two A.B.C. silver cups to promote sports, one for men and one for women. The first team to win the championship for three years will get to keep them permanently. The women's cup in the previous (first) tournament belonged to the United States, and the men's cup belonged to China. In this year's (second) tournament, the American girls kept the cup for another year. Whether the men's silver cup will remain in China's possession or be transferred to the hands of the United States will be decided tonight. In addition, the losing championship game between Korea and Jewish is also very moving, and there is a great deal of struggle between the strong and the weak. The order for tonight is as follows:</p>
<p>Korea vs. Jewish 6:30 PM Referee: Bo Latte Shao Ji</p>

<h3>Municipal Public Bonds Drawn for the First Time Yesterday</h3>
<p>Total of $210,000 in winning bonds; Payment of cash from the 31st of this month; Last year, the municipal government issued $3 million in municipal public bonds. The Municipal Finance Bureau held the first drawing yesterday in the deliberation hall of the Bank Association, presided over by Director Tang Naikang, with Xu Youru recording and registering, and Chen Kecheng as the emcee announcing the numbers. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Representatives from Various Parties Present; Representatives included Wang Shiduo from the Supervisory Yuan; Pang Zeen from the Ministry of Finance; Mayor Zhang, Zhu Hao, Zhu Ming, Yuan Shengting, and Chen Kecheng from the Municipal Government; Dai Hongji from the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court; Wu Deying from the Local Court; Zhu Jianming from the Bank of China; Li Tisheng from the Central Bank; Jin Jingyuan and Shen Zhonghao from the Bank of Communications; Xia Peide from the Municipal Bank; Xu Jili from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce; Tao Leqin from the Fund Management Committee; Lin Kanghou from the Bank Association; Yan Junan from the Money Industry Association; and Yu Qiaqing, Fang Jiaobo, Fan Jietang, and more than a hundred others.</p>
<p>Various Supervisors; The supervisors were Wu Deying, Wang Shiduo, Jin Jingyuan, Yan Junan, Tao Leqin, Li Tisheng, Zhu Jianming, Xia Peide, Fan Jietang, Pang Zeen, and ten others.</p>
<p>Meeting Agenda; (1) Ring the bell to start the meeting; (2) Pay the highest respects to Sun Yat-sen's portrait; (3) Read the will; (4) Silence; (5) Mayor's speech; (6) Chairman's report; (7) Invite supervisors to check the signed checks and check stubs; (8) Perform the lottery; (9) Tea and refreshments; (10) Adjournment</p>
<p>Mayor's Speech Excerpt; Today is the first drawing of municipal public bonds. I am honored to have all the representatives present to participate in the supervision. Since the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Government in the 17th year of the Republic of China, it has been actively carrying out various new construction projects in order to create a new Shanghai. Since I took office, I have been thinking about further advancing the municipal construction. However, construction projects require funds everywhere, which has made the municipal government's expenses feel even more enormous. Therefore, there is the issuance of public bonds. The issuance of public bonds does not have any difficulties in fact, because on the one hand, it can get the enthusiastic support of all sectors, and on the other hand, it is for the public interest of the citizens. However, the municipal government has specially formed a public bond fund management committee to show its creditworthiness, and the members of the committee are all leaders and prestigious figures from all sectors. Therefore, in terms of credit, not only I dare to be responsible, but also the fellow citizens and the members of the fund management committee dare to be responsible. As for the use of these 3 million public bonds, 1 million will be used to establish a municipal bank, 500,000 will be used to construct the central area of the city, 200,000 will be used to reorganize old public bonds, and the rest will be used for new construction projects other than the main roads of the city. The future new construction of Shanghai will also start from here. Moreover, the refunding fund for this drawing not only does not feel insufficient, but also has a surplus, which further shows the municipal government's prudence regarding public bonds. After the speech, Chairman Tang Naikang, Director of the Bureau, reported on the situation in a similar way.</p>
<p>Lottery Results; A total of seven bonds were drawn this time, each worth $30,000, for a total amount of $210,000. The winning numbers are 12, 46, 60, 63, 74, 85, 98. All winning bonds will be paid in cash, including principal and interest, from the Shanghai Central, Communications, China, and Municipal Banks starting from the 31st of this month.</p>

<h3>After the Sale of the China and Foreign Telephone Company, the Ministry of Communications is Preparing to Recover It</h3>
<p>Prepare cash at the actual price to recover the Chinese shares; After the sale of the Shanghai China and Foreign Telephone Company, the Ministry of Communications is still proceeding with the method of recovering sovereignty. Yesterday, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce also received a letter from the Ministry notifying all Chinese shareholders not to transfer their equity to foreigners. The Ministry can prepare cash at the actual price to recover it. The original letter and notice are recorded below:</p>
<p>Original Letter from the Ministry of Communications; Sirs, Regarding the case of the Shanghai China and Foreign Telephone Company being sold to the International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation in June of the 19th year and renamed the Shanghai Telephone Company, and the Shanghai Concession authorities arbitrarily approving the 40-year telephone franchise, it not only infringes upon our national sovereignty but also hinders the progress of recovering the Concession. When the Ministry heard of this proposal beforehand, it prepared to negotiate in September of the 18th year and advocated that the government prepare the price to recover it. On one hand, the Ministry requested the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to instruct the Shanghai Jiangsu Negotiator and the Shanghai Office to seriously negotiate with the Shanghai Consul Corps. On the other hand, it prepared to implement the procedures for recovery. However, the Shanghai Consul Corps and the Public Works Department authorities had no sincerity and deliberately delayed the protests and negotiations of our government. They also allowed the China and Foreign Company to proceed with the sale. On June 12 of the 19th year, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs approved the Ministry's request and issued a declaration in Chinese and English, stating that the Chinese government could not recognize any method of the China and Foreign Telephone Company's sale to foreign merchants, in preparation for future negotiations. At the same time, the Ministry also requested the Shanghai business community and the Chinese directors of the Concession to provide assistance. At that time, the public sent many letters and telegrams and were able to cooperate quite well. However, the company's board of directors attributed all measures to the shareholders, and the Chinese shareholders were mostly scattered small shareholders and lacked unity. As a result, although the Chinese shareholders were absent and protested against the company's bidding method, it was easily passed by the Western shareholders in the company. Negotiations have not been successful for more than a year, which is regrettable. However, the Ministry's determination to recover the Shanghai Concession telephone has not changed because of this. Now that the company has disregarded the protests of our government and people and has brazenly implemented the transfer, our government can only use effective methods to remedy the situation. The Ministry has repeatedly consulted with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and decided to proceed from the practical side to gradually recover the sovereignty. The State Council has approved the proposal and is now implementing it step by step. However, this matter is of great importance, and its success still depends on the efforts of the public, and the unity of the Chinese shareholders is particularly important. It is found that the original shareholders of the company, the Chinese shareholders, actually accounted for 47%. If they could have united and cooperated to protest at that time, the company's sale plan could have been cancelled. In view of this past, it is even more necessary to make plans early to seek unity. It is known that your association is a gathering place for Chinese merchants and has a long-standing reputation. I hope that you will take the lead in leading and supporting the government. I am now enclosing a detailed list of the names and addresses of the Chinese shareholders of the Shanghai Telephone Company and ask you to notify the Chinese shareholders to register with your association and not to sell the shares to foreigners again. If you want to sell, the Ministry will prepare cash at the actual price to recover them. This method will enable a complete statistical count of the Chinese shares and will not be difficult to gradually recover the Shanghai Concession telephone. I am corresponding to you accordingly, hoping that you will investigate and reply with the progress of the handling. Sincerely, Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Notice from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce; The case of the Shanghai China and Foreign Telephone Company being sold to the International Telephone Company and renamed the Shanghai Telephone Company was decided after consultation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to gradually recover the sovereignty from the practical side, and the State Council approved it. It is now being implemented step by step. The original shareholders of the company, the Chinese shares, actually accounted for 47%. The unity of the shareholders is particularly important. The names of the Chinese shareholders of the Shanghai Telephone Company are now enclosed. Please notify the Chinese shareholders to register with the Chamber of Commerce and not to sell the shares to foreigners again. If you want to sell, the Ministry will prepare cash at the actual price to recover them, etc. The matter is related to protecting sovereignty, and the government has already decided on a method of gradual recovery. All nationals should sincerely support it. Moreover, the Ministry of Communications has promised to prepare cash at the actual price to recover them, and there is no damage to the actual interests of the Chinese shares. It is the same sale, and it should be allowed to be taken over by the Ministry of Communications in order to prevent the gradual recovery plan from being interrupted. I am afraid that the addresses of the shareholders have changed and the letters may be incorrect. A special announcement is hereby published in the newspaper instead of sending individual letters. I hope you will appreciate it.</p>
<h3>Sinking of the Changjiang</h3>
<p>Three female passengers and eleven crew members drowned; Sixty-two crew members and passengers rescued arrived in Shanghai yesterday; Total loss of ship and cargo estimated at over 1 million; The Shanghai Shipping Company's Changjiang liner, managed by Kang Zhenji of Renji Road in this city, was returning to Shanghai from Annan Haiphong when it met with an accident at the junction of the Fuzhou and Wenzhou sea areas. Fourteen people died, including passengers, crew members, and stokers. Sixty-two crew members were rescued and returned to Shanghai yesterday by a French warship. Our reporter went to various parties to record the details of the ship's accident as follows:</p>
<p>Reef Trapped Under Hull; The Changjiang liner, flying the French flag and traveling between Shanghai and Vietnam, was carrying coal back to Shanghai from Haiphong on the 13th. It was originally scheduled to enter the port on the morning of the 18th, but at 2:00 PM on the 16th, when it was sailing to the junction of the Min and Ou sea areas in the North Yushan sea area, a thick fog occurred. At that time, it was heard that the first mate was on duty and the shipowner, Krathat, was resting in the room. The ship suddenly struck a reef outside North Yushan in the fog. The bottom of its second hold was immediately trapped by the reef and the hull was broken, allowing seawater to enter the ship. However, it was not immediately submerged.</p>
<p>Reversing Engine Breaks Bottom, Sinks Ship; Upon receiving the report, the shipowner hurried out of the cabin to observe, thinking that he could find a way to escape the danger. He immediately ordered the driver, Goodmus, to quickly reverse the engine so that it could retreat back into the sea. The driver and stoker dared not disobey and immediately reversed the engine. Unexpectedly, the reef trapped in the second hold was very sharp. As soon as the engine was reversed, the hull retreated, but the bottom of the second hold had been split into two, and a large amount of seawater entered the hull, causing it to sink immediately. Most of the crew members and passengers on board were unable to escape and drowned.</p>
<p>Fourteen Lives Lost; Hull Split Open, Ship Sinks Immediately; In total, it only took ten minutes from hitting the reef to sinking. At this time, the crew members, stokers, sailors, servants, and passengers on board rushed to the deck to untie the lifeboats in an attempt to escape. There were eight passengers in the cabin who came to Shanghai from Hong Kong, including five men and three women. After the three female passengers grabbed a lifeboat on the deck, they untied the rope and lowered it into the sea. Unexpectedly, one end of the hanging rope was not untied in a hurry and the lifeboat was lowered, causing it to capsize. The three female passengers (all Cantonese) fell into the sea and were immediately swept away by the huge waves. The bodies of the deceased have not been found. The other 73 crew members and male passengers competed for eight lifeboats and hurriedly lowered them into the sea. Unexpectedly, the ship sank too quickly and the ropes could not be untied. All eight lifeboats also capsized into the sea. Of these 73 people, two servants, four stokers, one foreign kitchen chief steward, one person from the management department, and three cooks, totaling eleven people, all drowned because they did not know how to swim.</p>
<p>Passengers Climb Mountain to Hide; After the lifeboats capsized, more than fifty crew members, sailors, stokers, and passengers swam and climbed up a small island opposite North Yushan to temporarily hide because the small island was only twenty-odd feet away from the shipwreck. These fifty-odd people stayed on the island for one night and a half a day. The clothes on each person's body were completely wet and there were no changes, and there was no food and they were hungry and cold for twenty hours. At 9:00 AM on the 17th, the villagers of North Yushan opposite saw the crew members living on the small island and sent eight small sampans to rescue the fifty-odd people, giving them food and clothing to change into while waiting for rescue.</p>
<p>Shipowner Sends for Help; When the ship was in distress, the shipowner sent a radio distress signal, which was first received by an American ship. Because it could not be found at that time, it was sent to Shanghai on its behalf. Kang Zhenji of the Shanghai Company received the report and immediately sent a radio message to Fujian to inquire, but no one accepted it. Kang Zhenji also went to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to ask them to send a telegram to the Wenzhou branch to inquire on their behalf. The Wenzhou branch ordered Haiyan to inquire, but the ship had already sunk, so they telegraphed back to Shanghai saying that it could not be found. Therefore, there was a rumor for a time that the Changjiang was missing.</p>
<p>Japanese Ship Relays Telegram, French Warship Arrives; The day after the ship's accident, the crew members and others had been rescued to North Yushan. The shipowner also left the ship to the mountain and hung a distress flag on the North Yushan lighthouse. At that time, a Japanese ship passed by and saw the distress signal and relayed a telegram to the French warship in Zhoushan, informing them of the location of the ship's accident. The French warship Mengna then sailed to the rescue.</p>
<p>Number of People Rescued; The French warship Mengna arrived off North Yushan at 10:00 AM on the 18th. At that time, it wanted to rescue the people on the mountain back to Shanghai, but the waves were extremely large and the sampan was overturned as soon as it was put into the sea. The French warship had to anchor at sea and wait for the waves to subside before rescuing them again. It was not until about 8:00 AM on the 19th that the waves subsided. The French warship then put the sampan into the sea and sailed to North Yushan, rescuing the shipowner, the first and second mates, and 57 other crew members, as well as five passengers, and sailed back to Shanghai. At about 1:00 PM, the ship arrived in Shanghai and anchored off the Jingjiang River in the outer ocean. The Jiangnan small barge was dispatched to carry the rescued people ashore.</p>
<p>Currently Temporarily Residing in French Concession Police Station; The 62 crew members and passengers who were rescued were first led by Kang Zhenji to Tailai Inn for lunch, and then sent to the French Concession Police Station. The police station specially set aside a room in the Songshan Road Police Station for the people to live in. When the reporter arrived at the police station, he saw that the rescued people were all in ragged clothes and were very embarrassed. Among the crew members and workers, there were many Cantonese and Ningbo people, and there were also Annamese people. They are waiting for the company to send them back to their hometowns.</p>
<p>Company's Post-Accident Arrangements; Kang Zhenji has not yet expressed any post-accident arrangements for the victims, and the shipowner's accident report has not yet been submitted. It is heard that the company is currently planning to buy ship tickets for the crew members in the police station and send them back to Annan, Guangdong, and Ningbo, and plans to pay them wages. Another plan to provide compensation for the deceased stokers, servants, cooks, etc. is under discussion.</p>
<p>Huge Sum of Money Also Sinks; The cargo carried by the ship from Annan to Shanghai was coal. After arriving in Hong Kong, more than 30 boxes of silver dollars were added, totaling 160,000 to 170,000 yuan. There were also 1,000-odd new purple copper bars, which were also very expensive. They all sank together. The loss of only part of the cargo in the ship is at least 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. The personal clothes and luggage of the crew members and workers were also completely lost.</p>
<p>Total Ship Loss; The ship weighed 4,500 tons and was built in 1907. The hull was still in good condition. According to the company, the loss of the ship's hull would be more than 500,000 yuan.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>Including cargo and cash, the estimated loss is more than one million. When the French warship left North Yushan yesterday, the chimney of the Changjiang had also sunk, leaving only about two feet of the mast wood top on the sea surface. The bottom of the ship was split open and there was no hope of salvaging it.</p>
<p>Another Report of the French Warship's Righteous Deed; It is also reported that at 3:00 PM on the 17th of this month, the radio in the French Concession of this city suddenly received a distress signal from the Changjiang on North Yushan, saying that it had hit a reef and needed help. It immediately notified the French warship Namaer, which was berthed in the Huangpu River, to rush to the rescue. It has now returned to Shanghai yesterday. A total of five passengers and sixty-five crew members were rescued in this operation and brought to Shanghai. The Chief of Police of the French Concession has sent personnel to take care of them and provide the victims with clothing, food, and other items. The injured will be sent to the hospital for treatment, and they will be sent back to their hometowns when a convenient ship passes through Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Transfer of Ownership of Sanxin Yarn Factory</h3>
<p>Workers Insist on Settling Affairs First - Labor-Management Negotiations Failed Yesterday - Day and Night Shifts Completely Stopped Yesterday</p>
<p>Since the announcement of the sale of the Sanxin Textile Factory on Yangshupu Road, it has attracted attention from all walks of life. The Municipal Social Bureau sent personnel to thoroughly investigate. Rong Zongjing's attempt to take over the factory the day before yesterday failed due to worker rejection. That evening, the night shift was declared closed. Yesterday afternoon at 5 p.m., representatives of labor and management negotiated a solution at the Sanxin Yarn Factory office at No. 7 Huangpu Bund Road, but no agreement was reached. The details of yesterday's situation are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Yesterday's Situation</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Yangshupu Police Station dispatched more than 20 armed Chinese and foreign detectives to maintain order inside and outside the factory, and cavalry patrolled. In the morning, male and female day shift workers came one after another, preparing to enter the factory to work, unaware that the factory had declared a shutdown the night before, so many waited on the road. Currently, each department inside the factory is guarded by more than ten workers dispatched by the workers' relief group to prevent accidents, and notices are posted to instruct workers to strictly observe order, so the order inside the factory is very good. Male and female workers, especially male and female child laborers, waited persistently and refused to leave at the factory gate. Yesterday afternoon, the police station sent an additional 16 patrol officers to the factory for protection.</p>
<p>Workers' Meeting</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 10 a.m., the relief group organized by the workers convened a temporary emergency meeting, attended by all staff members, union representatives, and department heads, totaling more than 200 people. It was resolved to (1) nominate Sun He, Chen Youqing, Jin Fuchu, Zhu Sanshan, Yang Desheng, Xu Zhixuan, Yu Zhisheng, and Gu Xiuyun as eight representatives responsible for negotiations; (2) demand that the factory owner compensate the workers for previously owed bonuses; (3) maintain workers' livelihoods; (4) issue workers severance pay; and (5) request lawyers Wu and Cai for legal assistance. The meeting adjourned at 12 p.m.</p>
<p>Workers' Petition</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the Cotton Textile Industry Union of the Third Special District sent representatives Hou Jiahai and Gu Lansheng, among others, to submit a petition to the Municipal Social Bureau, requesting a fair mediation based on the city's labor regulations and urging prompt withdrawal of armed detectives from the factory. It is reported that after receiving the workers' request for assistance, the Social Bureau sent personnel to investigate all parties and has now completed the investigation and is properly reviewing the matter.</p>
<p>Negotiations Fail</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4 p.m., representatives of labor and management negotiated a solution at the Sanxin Yarn Factory office at No. 7 Huangpu Bund Road. Labor representatives Sun He, Chen Youqing, and others attended. Factory owner Sheng Ze Cheng's representative only allowed four labor representatives due to the number of labor representatives. The labor side refused to compromise. Sheng Ze Cheng's representative insisted, and the negotiations failed, so each representative thought that the capital side had no sincerity to accept the consultation, and they hated it very much, so they returned to the factory to report to all workers and then planned further actions.</p>
<p>Internal Organization</p>
<p>The shareholders of Sanxin Yarn Factory are Sheng Ze Cheng with six shares, Sheng Ping Cheng with two shares, and the remaining two shares belonging to Sheng's residence. The chairman of each room is Sheng Ze Cheng, the foreign manager is Yu Cihua, the manager is Sheng Yu. The factory site occupies approximately 270 acres with a capital of 4.5 million. There are a total of 70,000 spindles and more than 1,000 looms, producing 18,013 packages of yarn and 253.728 bolts of cloth per day. Yarn trademarks are Blue Dragon, Red Dragon, Golden Double Horse, etc. Cloth trademarks are Double Horse, Four Horse, Grass Cow, Rain Dog, Human Tower, Wealth, etc. There are a total of 96 staff members and more than 4,000 workers. The actual price of the sale by HSBC is reportedly 4.5 million, but the total amount of the sale by Sassoon &amp; Co. was 5.8 million.</p>
<p>Two Notices</p>
<p>(1) Sanxin Yarn Factory posted a notice at the factory gate yesterday, stating that the factory is scheduled to temporarily close for a few days from March 20th. This notice is hereby issued. (2) The relief group organized by all staff members issued a notice yesterday, stating: Colleagues, please be aware that during this period, you should strictly observe order and refrain from any inappropriate actions. No one is allowed to leave the factory without permission. If there is an important matter, it must be reported and approved before leaving.</p>

<h3>Soviet Russia Competes in the World Oil Market</h3>
<p>Soviet Russia Establishes Agency in Shanghai</p>
<p>Recently, the Soviet Russian Oil Trust, in order to compete in the world oil market, has dispatched Mr. Li Pengnuofu as its representative to establish an office in Shanghai to contact Chinese merchants to promote Russian oil. Mr. Li told reporters yesterday that Soviet Russia now has the world's richest oil fields with 4.67 million tons of oil reserves, recently ranking third among the world's oil producing countries. However, after the successful industrialization that is now underway, it can jump to second place. Currently, Soviet Russia produces 20 million tons of oil annually, a sharp increase of more than double compared to before the war, when Soviet Russia produced only 9 million tons annually. It is estimated that in five years (i.e., by 1933), it can increase to 46 million tons, a double increase compared to the original Soviet Russian Five-Year Plan. Other oil-producing countries, due to the world's economic downturn and limited consumption, have seen a daily reduction in production. The development of Soviet Russia's oil production is partly due to its huge investment in the oil industry. The investment from October 1929 to October 1930 was 350 million rubles (accounting for about 10% of the total basic industry in the same year). In the future, more investment is needed and the quality of oil needs to be improved. Currently, gasoline factories are gradually established based on the latest American style, and their products are for domestic and export use. Exports from 1929 to 1930 were 4.62 million tons, five times higher than before the war (Russian oil exports in 1913 were 947,000 tons), and also increased by 28% compared to 1928-1929 (Russian oil exports in 1928-1929 were 3.63 million tons). Domestic consumption is also increasing daily, from 7.7455 tons in 1928-1929 to 10,115 tons in 1929-1930. Soviet Russia is now also focusing on the production of fuel oil. Before the war, kerosene accounted for 77% of its oil exports, gasoline accounted for 16%, and fuel oil accounted for 7%. Last year, kerosene accounted for 25.5%, gasoline accounted for 30%, and fuel oil accounted for 48%. Sales have been expanded globally, etc.</p>
<h3>Rumors of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Reorganization are Inaccurate</h3>
<p>Li Zhonggong Will Resume His Duties Next Week Due to Illness - The French Side is Not Sincere About the Jin Liyuan Case and a Breakup is Imminent</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice News Agency visited Mr. Song Shuqiao, Secretary General of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, yesterday to inquire about the rumors that Director-General Li was being passive. According to him, he had recently been suffering from tracheitis and the flu, and had been under medical treatment. He had not been able to come to the bureau for several days due to following the doctor's advice, and the various external rumors were not true. Moreover, Mr. Li had written to him today saying that he could come to the bureau next week. The reporter then inquired about the rumors of a breakup in the Jin Liyuan Wharf negotiation case. Mr. Song said that in this matter, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, in order to respect the opinions of the French Consul and the mediator Du Yuesheng, offered to buy the wharf based on the letter from Sandetang, but Sandetang's asking price of 390,000 taels exceeded the estimated price by many times. After Father Xiaqi returned to Shanghai, Attorney Gao Shuo visited Xiaqi on behalf of Director-General Li to discuss the matter. However, Xiaqi was arrogant and unreasonable, and the next day he sent a written letter informing Sandetang that he was willing to redeem the wharf for 200,000 taels. Yesterday, Attorney Bahe sent a letter to the bureau stating that the previous letter from Sandetang agreeing to transfer the wharf was withdrawn. Director-General Li was extremely angry about this and, in addition to writing to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to formally ask the French Consul to pay attention to this matter, the bureau decided to fight for it on the basis of reason and will appeal to the people of the country. If any misfortune occurs as a result of this case, Sandetang should bear full responsibility, etc.</p>
<h3>Changsha Chamber of Commerce Representatives Discuss Yihe Foreign Firm Robbery Case</h3>
<p>Nominate 11 People to be Stationed in Shanghai to be Responsible for Negotiations</p>
<p>On July 30th last year, the Changsha Yihe Foreign Firm suffered a robbery of more than one million yuan in passenger goods due to bandits occupying the city. Negotiations have been ongoing without any results. Now, representatives from various industries of the Changsha Chamber of Commerce, including Tang Nongjie, have come to Shanghai to negotiate. A meeting was convened at the Pacific Hotel yesterday, attended by more than 60 people from various Hunanese merchant houses in Shanghai, including Wang Xin and Liu Jusheng, and Wu Nanfu, etc. Everyone believed that although the situation at the time was serious, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Sanbei, Hong'an, Pujin, Taikoo, and Nissin companies handled it properly without any losses. Only the Yihe Company was negligent in its management responsibilities, resulting in this change. It is necessary to demand full compensation from them, otherwise, they should be treated with all their strength, and 11 people were elected on the spot to be stationed in Shanghai to be responsible for handling the matter.</p>
<h3>The Families of the Victims of the New Kang Disaster Continue to Petition the National Government</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Plenary Committee Meeting Resolved</p>
<p>The New Kang Steamer Disaster Family Association held a plenary committee meeting yesterday afternoon. First, Committee Member Zhu reported on the recent progress of the association's affairs and contacts with various parties. After the committee members expressed their opinions, they all agreed that although the case is currently in legal proceedings, if the right of consular jurisdiction is not abolished, it is feared that the other party will be difficult to be persuaded, and the date of resolution will be unknown for many years. In order to seek an early resolution, diplomatic means should also be used to continue active negotiations at the same time, so that a two-pronged approach may be easier to resolve. It was resolved to submit a request to the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Transportation, requesting that national rights and people's lives be given priority, and to continue to negotiate with the government to achieve compensation for (1) all losses; (2) to publicly nominate representatives to go to Beijing to petition the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Ministry of Transportation, requesting active and serious negotiations to abolish all unequal treaties, abolish consular jurisdiction, and cancel the right of foreign ships to navigate in the sea; (3) to publicly nominate Zhu Xiaoyun, Zhu Youcun, and Chen Jicheng as the third batch of representatives to go to Beijing to petition, and to go to Beijing to petition immediately; (4) to proceed with the lawsuit and contact lawyers Wu Jingxiong and Sheng Zhenwei at any time; (5) to send telegrams to all sectors of the country to unite and resist for assistance. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>

<h3>New Discovery of Tubercle Bacillus Delipidization</h3>
<p>(1) (Translated from the recent German Journal of Tuberculosis) Since Dr. Koch discovered tubercle bacilli as the causative agent of pulmonary tuberculosis (i.e., consumption), scholars of tuberculosis in the East and West have been vying to study it, hoping to find a miraculous way to kill this bacterium. But the results have all been failures. This is because general physicians in the past did not understand that tubercle bacilli have a special structure. They thought that all bacteria can be eradicated with disinfectants, either by internal administration or injection, just like injecting Salvarsan for syphilis. After Dr. Bergell's painstaking research, he began to publish that tubercle bacilli have a special defense force that can resist the attacks of all external drugs. The tubercle bacillus body is composed of a neutral fat inner membrane and an acid-fast wax outer membrane (Lipoid). Unless a way is found to destroy the waxy defense line and disarm its fatty armament, there is no way to capture the tubercle bacilli and put them to death. And when tubercle bacilli attack a local part of the human body, the surrounding area is eroded to form stubborn nodules to prevent the passage of blood flow, so that the general disinfectants injected or taken internally cannot cross the Lei Chi pool. Like a specially martial law forbidden area, the medicinal power cannot contact the affected area, so even if the whole body is immersed in the pool of medicine, it cannot harm the tubercle bacilli. Therefore, the only strategic plan to eliminate tubercle bacilli must at least have the following two prerequisites: (1) All medicinal powers can destroy nodules and directly reach the affected area; (2) They can also deprive or dissolve the waxy and fatty inner and outer membranes. Only in this way can the merit of breaking through the barriers and killing the generals be achieved. Otherwise, it is like scratching an itch from outside the boots. The tubercle bacilli, under these two guarantees, secretly laugh at people's inability to harm them.</p>
<p>(2) There have been Hammersehaly and Terebensky, etc., who discovered that the acidity of tubercle bacilli is due to the ability of wax to resist acid. Then, a 5 to 10% caustic potash solution was applied to remove the acid-fast wax of the tubercle bacilli. Later, Moussn and Goupjl applied chlorine gas and also removed the acid-fast wax. However, this delipidization method can only be applied to staining methods under a microscope. Because its medicinal properties are highly toxic, it cannot be used in practice for the human body.</p>
<p>In recent years, there have been occasional cases where chaulmoogra oil has been used for leprosy and has achieved unexpected results. This is because leprosy bacilli and tubercle bacilli are acid-fast bacteria of the same nature, and chaulmoogra oil can have a delipidizing effect and has a bactericidal power more than a hundred times that of carbolic acid. As a result, general scholars have aroused fanatical attention and thought of applying chaulmoogra oil to patients with tuberculosis in the hope of achieving results. They used various chemical methods to extract the main components of chaulmoogra oil, but it was limited to skin and superficial tuberculosis and could achieve good results, but it still could not achieve any effect for deep internal organs, such as the lungs, liver, and kidneys, etc.</p>
<p>(3) Therefore, Dr. Bergell, the great benefactor of tuberculosis sufferers all over the world, went a step further, collected various medicinal substances from animals, plants, and minerals, and painstakingly researched, hoping to find a kind of delipidizing substance that does not have the various shortcomings of chaulmoogra oil. For decades, he racked his brains and poured his heart's blood to find the most reasonable and purest chemical agent. Finally, it was found that a certain active ingredient in the compressed juice of the intermesenteric glands of special animals has a strong delipidizing effect on tubercle bacilli. This new component was immediately applied to tubercle bacilli, and the Ziehigabett staining method was performed. It was no longer stained red, but blue. This result is exactly the same as other non-acid-fast bacteria. From then on, the claim that the acid resistance of tubercle bacilli cannot be removed artificially, which was regarded by doctors in the East and West, was completely overturned, and it occupied the highest authority among delipidizing and bactericidal agents. This compound was then tested on various tuberculosis in animals and humans, and all achieved great miraculous effects without any side effects. This is indeed a new dawn for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis, a major question in the medical field for thousands of years before and after.</p>
<p>(4) After the pathogenesis and pathology of pulmonary tuberculosis were clarified, Dr. Bergell, the great medical saint, invented the ideal new medical theory for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis and also achieved great success through experiments. Sanosin, the only unique special medicine for pulmonary tuberculosis in the 20th century, was produced according to this new medical theory and new doctrine, opening up a new record that has never existed in the medical field. The main components contained in Sanosin are listed below.</p>
<p>The chemical name of the first component is Aminoaethyisulfonsaeure (C2H7Nso3), which is extracted from the liver of the intermesenteric glands of special animals and the blood of mollusks in the sea. Its chemical properties are colorless and transparent, and it is a shining four- or six-pointed crystal. It can be dissolved in 16 times the cold water at 12 degrees Celsius, and it is easier to dissolve in hot water, but it cannot be dissolved in anhydrous alcohol and ether. If boiled in a strong saline liquid, it becomes acetic acid and sulfurous acid. When merged with mercury, it forms a white powder that is insoluble in water. If it is decomposed at 240 degrees Celsius and mixed more finely with several times the sodium carbonate and heated on a platinum plate, a residue is produced. According to Dr. Schroder's experimental report, this component can directly act on tubercle bacilli and dissolve the waxy and fatty outer membrane. Once the tubercle bacilli lose this dangerous barrier, they cannot avoid their death sentence. What's more, this component also has a considerable stimulating effect, which can increase the secretion of bile in patients, and the function of metabolism becomes more vigorous. For lung lesions, it can also change its connective tissue and achieve a therapeutic effect. ) The second component is KaliumSulfoguajacolicumG6H3(CH(OCH)2SO2OK, created by Dr. Tiemann, which can enhance the resistance and serum coagulation of tuberculosis patients, promote metabolism, increase white blood cells, and prevent the development of tubercle bacilli. It has the special effects of strengthening the stomach, eliminating phlegm, and disinfecting. Therefore, since Dr. GrReichenbach, a famous modern tuberculosis doctor, advocated its application in pulmonary tuberculosis, doctors in Germany, England, and other countries have regarded this ingredient as the supreme holy product for the treatment of tuberculosis.</p>
<p>(5) The new drug Sanosin is made by combining the above two precious and important components. Therefore, Sanosin is an unprecedented and definitive special new drug for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis and has extremely great value. Its medicinal effects are listed below. (1) When the medicinal power of (Sanosin) is tested in a test tube, tubercle bacilli all lose their acid resistance after one minute. After three minutes, the tubercle bacilli are completely killed, without a single survivor. (2) When Sanosin is applied to the human body by internal administration or injection, it can penetrate into the lungs and other internal organs. When urine is examined 18 hours later, the DIAZO reaction can be found. After 48 hours, this reaction disappears and the white blood cells increase significantly. (3) According to animal experiments, it was found that (Sanosin) can penetrate into the tuberculosis lesions. If the latent tubercle bacilli in the lesions are examined, they will all</p>
<p>Lose its acid resistance. This proves that its wax is completely dissolved. (4) About a week after taking (Sanosin) internally, the sputum can be seen to be diluted, the body temperature to be lowered, and the mental and physical state to be pleasant. (5) If you continue to take (Sanosin) internally for more than one or two months, you will clearly see an increase in body weight, a radical improvement in appetite, and all symptoms gradually ease, finally achieving the great merit of turning the tide and recreating life.</p>

<h3>Continued Hearing of the Xue Die Contract Termination Case</h3>
<p>Hu Die is determined to terminate the contract. The courthouse was packed yesterday morning. Xue Die stood on opposite sides of the witness box. Lin said the contract termination was mostly not Hu's own intention. Die replied, "How do you know it wasn't my intention?" Disagreement arose sharply over goods payments and loans. Signatures and handwriting required much research. Further investigation and adjourned hearing are required. The lawsuit filed by Hu Die, a movie actress from the Star Film Company, and her fiancé Lin Xuehuai to terminate their engagement was preliminarily heard on the 28th of last month by Judge Zhou Daren of the Special District Court, who, reluctant to see a good match turn into a bad outcome, diligently ordered both parties to attempt reconciliation outside the court. In the event that restoring the old relationship proved difficult, he would conduct a continued hearing on the 20th of this month. Lin initially sent a letter through his lawyer to Hu on the 10th of this month, expressing his regret for past mistakes, while Hu, on the 14th, also replied with a letter through her lawyer, using indignant language. Since then, the two parties have engaged in a major war of words, with each letter being disclosed in this newspaper. As of yesterday, the date of the continued hearing, the two parties met again in court. Notable aspects of the court hearing are recorded below:</p>
<p>Crowds Inside and Outside the Courthouse. Around 8:00 AM yesterday morning, when a heavy fog enveloped the streets, the Special District Court on North Zhejiang Road was already crowded with people. Young men and women flocked to the court, many of whom had failed to secure a seat at the previous hearing and therefore arrived early this time, hoping to be among the first to enter. Since the previous hearing had been held in the Third Criminal Court, they assumed it would be the same place and crowded into the Third Court. However, when the police escorted numerous criminal cases to the court, it was suspected that the hearing would be moved to the Second Court. Unexpectedly, they all rushed upstairs, only to be turned away by the bailiffs at the Second Court. They then returned downstairs and flocked to the First Court of the High Branch, where the double doors were wide open and the lights inside were off, resembling a dark room. Seeing that it didn't look like a hearing was about to begin, the audience turned back to the Third Court. At this time, the entrance to that court was heavily guarded by bailiffs, restricting entry and exit. The crowd then gathered at the entrance, with some standing on the stairs, neither advancing nor retreating, obstructing traffic. Although the bailiffs tried to persuade them to disperse, they ignored the requests.</p>
<p>The Audience Surrounds Hu Die's Car. In fact, the location of the hearing had already been decided as the First Court of the High Branch, but it was feared that announcing it would cause the crowd to rush in, making it difficult to maintain order. Therefore, it was kept secret for the time being, and only the court clerk informed the lawyers and parties concerned when they arrived at the court. The general audience, unaware of the exact location, acted like madmen, shouting and rushing back and forth, which was quite amusing. After 9:00 AM, Hu Die and Lin Xuehuai, each accompanied by their lawyers, arrived at the court by car. The crowd suddenly rushed towards Hu's car, surrounding it from all sides, eager to catch a glimpse of her. As a result, Hu was unable to get out of the car. The bailiffs then dispersed the crowd, and Hu Die was able to get out with her lawyer, Zhan Jifeng. Hu's father, Shao Gong, and an old woman with white hair and a yellow fox fur collar, wearing a long robe, followed Hu Die, led by Lawyer Zhan, to the lawyers' lounge. The crowd, thinking they were going to the courtroom, also rushed over, and the entrance to the lawyers' lounge was instantly filled with people standing shoulder to shoulder. Every time a lawyer entered or exited, the bailiffs had to clear the way. Such a crowded scene was truly rare. With judicial police guarding the front and back doors. At 10:30 AM, Lawyers Eson and Ni Zheng'ao arrived in a car parked in front of the women's prison and invited their client, Lin Xuehuai, to enter the First Court of the High Branch through the side door. Hu Die, her father, and the accompanying old woman also followed Lawyer Zhan from the lawyers' lounge into the First Court. The audience tried to rush in again, but the chief of the judicial police had temporarily assigned seven or eight additional bailiffs to guard the front and back doors of the court. Despite such strict precautions, two or three hundred people still managed to squeeze in, while countless others remained outside the door. They were persuaded to disperse by the bailiffs, so there was no chaotic situation. At 11:00 AM, Judge Zhou Daren arrived in court with the court clerk and began the questioning. The hearing adjourned at 11:50 AM, with the announcement that further investigation was needed and a new hearing date would be set. The people inside the court rushed out, and those outside the court, hearing the court door creak open, suspected that the hearing was still in progress and tried to rush in, holding each other at the doorway. After another three minutes, the crowd finally realized the truth and dispersed like a tide. It can truly be said to have been an extremely grand divorce case.</p>
<p>Hu Die Only Seeks to Terminate the Engagement. Hu Die did not wear a hat yesterday, her hair was curled, and she wore a beige flannel coat, white gloves, and carried a coin purse. After arriving at the First Court, she sat on the right-hand side with her father and the old woman, her face solemn and without a smile. Lin Xuehuai, still in the same suit as before, sat in the back row of the lawyers' seats, only a foot away from Hu, but they did not look at each other, as if separated by a thousand miles. Judge Zhou pointed to Xue and Die, who stood on opposite sides of the witness box, and asked both parties about the progress of reconciliation after the previous adjournment. Hu Die spoke first, saying that the defendant's character, morality, and behavior were all very bad, and that reconciliation was impossible. She requested that the judge make a speedy judgment to avoid prolonged mental suffering. The judge asked her the purpose of her request, and Hu said that she only sought to terminate the engagement.</p>
<p>Lin Xuehuai Suffers Mentally. The judge then turned to Lin Xuehuai to ask about the reconciliation process. Lin replied that on the 10th, he had asked his lawyer to send a letter to Lawyer Zhan, requesting him to convey to the plaintiff his desire to maintain the engagement, but her reply was full of abuse, accusing him of encroaching on the car and trying to deny debts. At the end of the letter, Lawyer Zhan added that he should quickly confess the facts of his cover-ups and embellishments. He was extremely dissatisfied and felt greatly insulted. Lawyer Eson then presented the letter as evidence and said that although the defendant had been unhappy with the plaintiff before, he had sent a letter asking for her forgiveness, but the reply did not mention reconciliation at all, and instead ended with words such as "confess the facts truthfully," attacking the defendant severely. This really caused the defendant great pain.</p>
<p>The Reply Letter Fully Expressed Hu Die's Intention. Lawyer Zhan immediately said that the content of the reply letter fully expressed the intention of his client. The key to this case lies in the dissatisfaction with the defendant's character. Therefore, although he sincerely asked the plaintiff to reconcile, the plaintiff, because the defendant had previously written two letters, one saying "the kindness and righteousness are broken," and the other saying "terminate the engagement quickly," instructed him to write a reply asking the defendant to confess the facts of his cover-ups and embellishments to the world before reconciliation could be discussed. He then also presented the letters as evidence. The judge then asked Hu Die if the letter she replied on the 14th was her true intention, and Hu replied that it was entirely her own intention.</p>
<p>Hu Die Insistently Demands Termination of the Engagement. The judge then asked Lin Xuehuai that now that Hu Die was unwilling to maintain the engagement and wanted to terminate it, what was his intention? Lin replied that he knew the contract termination was mostly not Hu's own intention, so he was still unwilling to terminate it. Hu Die then said in a loud voice, "How do you know it wasn't my intention? I have already said it in court myself. How can you force me? Let alone you, no one can interfere." The judge asked Hu Die if she wanted to terminate the engagement unconditionally, and Hu said that she had suffered greatly and suffered too much loss. This small amount of compensation for the loss should be paid to her. The judge then asked Lin for his opinion, and Lin said that he still felt there was no reason to terminate the engagement. Lawyer Zhan then said that the defendant had twice expressed his desire to terminate the engagement, but now he suddenly did not want to terminate it, his intention being to avoid bearing the name of terminating the engagement.</p>
<p>The Problem of the Six Hundred Yuan Loan. The judge then changed the subject to the loan. First, he asked if there was evidence for the six hundred yuan loan, and Lawyer Zhan presented the check for this amount, saying that when the defendant went to the bank to withdraw the money, he had stamped the back of the check. The judge then handed the check to Lin for inspection. Lin said that the check was for him to get cash from the bank on her behalf, which he had already handed over to the plaintiff and could not prove that the money on the check was used to lend to him. He asked if there was evidence of the money being handed over. He signed the check with her as his fiancée, and he did not know that there would be today's events and did not obtain evidence. He asked if he had money deposited in the Hongkou branch of the Shanghai Bank. Lin said no. The judge turned to Hu Die and asked if she had evidence that she had lent the defendant six hundred yuan and then helped him put together five hundred taels and deposited it in the bank. Hu replied that she only saw the defendant give her a current account booklet from the Shanghai Bank, but she did not pay attention to whether the money was deposited in the branch or the head office.</p>
<p>The Car Price is Three Hundred and Eighty Taels. The judge then asked about the situation of the loans other than the six hundred yuan. Hu replied that the remaining money was all given in the form of checks, with the account name being "Butterfly Company." Some of the checks had a stamp, and some had her father's signature. She asked if the car was also bought with checks, and she replied yes, the car price was three hundred and eighty taels, divided into three checks, stating that the payee was Anfei Automobile Company, but the car repair costs were not included in the car price.</p>
<p>Goods Invoices are Evidence. The judge asked what evidence there was for the goods payments. Hu replied that it was the invoices. The judge asked if there were account books, and Hu replied that there were no account books. The judge asked who signed the invoices, and Hu replied that most of them were signed by Lin. The judge then handed the invoices to Hu and ordered her to pick out those signed by Lin. Hu replied that because she rarely saw him write, she did not recognize his handwriting very well. The judge then handed the invoices to Lin for him to read himself. Lin looked through them for a long time and said that only two of the handwriting was quite similar, but he had settled the account at the end of the month for the goods he took from the plaintiff's store and had never been in arrears. These two may have been forgotten. Lawyer Zhan then said that the defendant had previously admitted to owing more than one hundred yuan for goods, but now he was taking advantage of the plaintiff's weakness that she did not recognize his handwriting and was denying owing money. The judge then reviewed the invoices one by one and discovered that several of them were signed by Lin, but Lin said that he could not remember them one by one. If he did owe money for goods, he should produce the account books to prove it.</p>
<p>Taking Goods and Paying for Them Would Not Lead to Arrears. The judge then asked Hu if there was other evidence for invoices not signed by the defendant. Hu replied that she had to ask the defendant. She assumed that since he owed money, he could not deny it. Lin immediately said that the plaintiff was intentionally damaging his character and wanted to use the money owed as a tool to terminate the engagement. The judge still asked the defendant if he owed the plaintiff 185 yuan for goods. Lin replied that this amount was opened by the plaintiff, and he did not know about it, but he had paid for the goods he took and probably would not be in arrears.</p>
<p>It Was Said That the Loan Had to be Returned. The judge then asked about the loan to the defendant. Lin replied that the plaintiff's store was often financially strapped and could hardly lend him more than a thousand yuan. The judge also asked the plaintiff whether she had evidence regarding the loan. Hu replied that the money borrowed by the defendant was all the money she had earned, and there was no evidence. The judge asked if the 1385 yuan and 191 taels claimed were given to him for use as a fiancé and fiancée or had to be returned. Hu replied that these two amounts were loans and it was said that they had to be returned, and the money she lent him for use was not included in the calculation because there was no evidence. Lin said that this was a joke.</p>
<p>Xuehuai's Occupation and Salary. The judge then asked the defendant whether he had brought the newspaper that he had previously stated contained rumors of Hu Die's improper behavior. The defendant said that Zhu had brought it. Lawyer Zhan then requested the court to ask the defendant about his previous occupation and salary. Lawyer E objected and the request was denied. The judge then asked Lin if he had any other claims. Lin replied that he requested to maintain the engagement and had no other claims.</p>
<p>This Case Requires Further Investigation of Evidence. The judge asked where Zhou Jianyun lived, and Lin replied at the Star Film Company on Dumei Road. The judge adjourned the hearing and declared that the case required further investigation of evidence. After the investigation was confirmed, another hearing date would be set. Thus, the second act of the Xue Die marriage change came to an end.</p>
<p>Continuing the War of Words and Discussing Legal Principles. After returning home, the war of words continued. Because Lawyers E and Ni had replied with another letter on behalf of Lin Xuehuai the day before, they invited Ms. Hu to read it. According to reports, after reading the reply letter, she said that Die's reply was full of scolding, and after reading it, she couldn't help but laugh. After carefully reading the entire letter, the text was full of how deeply he loved, how kind, and how sincere his true love was, etc., but there was no explanation of the legal principles that cannot be separated from the word "love." Now, abandoning the word "reason" to talk about "emotion," is it because the reason is exhausted? One must know that emotion has emotion, reason has reason, and law has law. This is like a car having rails, and if it goes without them, how can it run? The provisions of Chapter 4 of the General Principles of the Civil Code regarding the expression of intent are intended to make the person expressing the intent bound by the expression of intent. If arbitrary revocation is allowed, then what is the value of this provision? This is legal principle. It is reported that when Mr. Lin is angry, he repeatedly seeks to terminate the engagement and demand compensation for damages, but suddenly he wants to maintain the old engagement and again tries to deny debts and encroach on money. His repeated words and actions are such that Die cannot bear it. Die had previously stated in a letter that she did not have time to waste words. Now, with a bone stuck in her throat, she makes a final rebuttal and entrusts this lawyer to reply, hoping that your esteemed lawyers will sincerely persuade your client to wake up quickly and not argue any further. Sincerely, Eson and Ni Zheng'ao, Barristers. Lawyer Zhan Jifeng, March 20, 20th year.</p>
<h3>Piracy and Plunder on the Pinghu Small Ferry</h3>
<p>Violent Pirates Pose as Passengers. The ship was raided after reaching Duxing. A shot was fired at the accountant's room. Fortunately, the injury was not serious. The Pinghu No. 1 small ferry, operated by the Pinghu Ferry Company of the Dali Wharf on Nanjing Guanqiao Bridge, which travels between Shanghai and Pinghu, was robbed by bandits around 5:00 PM the day before yesterday (the 19th) after departing from Pinghu and sailing to Shanghai via Tangkou and Zhangang. Fortunately, there were few passengers at the time, and there were no major injuries. As a result, the ship's supervisor was shot and injured in the left shin by the bandits, with losses of about a thousand yuan. The detailed circumstances are recorded below:</p>
<p>The Pinghu Ferry Runs Three Times a Day. There are two major companies operating small ferries between Shanghai and Pinghu, both located on the Pujiang River near Guanqiao Bridge in the Nanshi area. One is the Minnan Ferry Company of the Dashun Wharf, and the other is the Pinghu Ferry Company of the Dali Wharf. The two companies have a total of five small ferries: the Minnan, Pingshen, and Xinmin of the Minnan Company, and the Pinghu and Shanghai of the Pinghu Company. The two companies are integrated and operate in shifts three times a day, and their business is still sustainable.</p>
<p>More Than Ten Violent Pirates Pose as Passengers. The first shift the day before yesterday (the 19th) was the Pinghu of the Pinghu Ferry, which departed from Shanghai to Pinghu at 7:00 AM, intending to return to Shanghai at 5:30 PM, which was the earliest return shift of the day. The ship arrived in Pinghu at 11:20 AM at noon, and then set sail at 1:00 PM to return to Shanghai via Xintang, Mijing, Xuanlai Temple, Yexie, Minhang, and other ports. When the ship arrived in Minhang, more than ten violent pirates, both men and women, disguised as passengers and mixed into the ship.</p>
<p>Suddenly Robbery Occurred Midway. The ship was scheduled to sail directly to Shanghai after leaving Minhang. Around 4:00 PM, when the ship was sailing through the northern part of the Duxing Township and south of the Tangkou, a red light flashed in a nearby port, and a boat sped towards the ship and fired three shots to warn the ship. The pirates in the ship also took out their guns and monitored the actions of the crew members in the master cabin and engine room, and did not allow the ship to stop, but slowly sailed to avoid the eyes and ears of the river patrol. One of the pirates commanded the other pirates to start searching and robbing all the silver dollars and other items around the passengers on the ship. They were still not satisfied and wanted to strip the passengers of their clothes and transport them together with the passengers' luggage to the small boat with the red light.</p>
<p>Accountant Cao Jiecai Was Shot. After the pirates had robbed the passengers, they then rushed to the accounting room and asked who was the accountant. The ship's accountant, Cao Jiecai, had no way to hide and had to come out and answer, "I am." The pirate asked Cao for 5,000 yuan in cash. Cao replied that there was no cash on the ship. The pirates then threatened Cao with guns and wanted to take Cao's long robe. Cao then said to the pirates, "If you want silver dollars, I will lend you two yuan, but please don't take my clothes and make me cold." The pirates hated Cao for his cunning and fired a shot, hitting Cao's lower left leg. He immediately fell down in pain. At that time, the pirates were searching the crew members and all the rooms, and no one was spared. Even the small accounts collected by the tea room were robbed. It is estimated that the robbery lasted for about two hours and robbed more than 2,000 yuan in cash (including passengers) and countless clothes.</p>
<p>The Fellow Villagers Association Telephones to Request Arrest. After the pirates had finished looting, they jumped back into the small boat, fired a shot, and sped away. Afterwards, the ship's captain helped Accountant Cao Jiecai up and found that the injury was not fatal, so he immediately sailed back to Shanghai and reported the incident to the company, which then reported it to the land and water police to strictly arrest the pirates. In addition, the injured accountant Cao Jiecai was sent by car to Qu Zhibu Hospital on Penglai Road in Nanshi for treatment. Because the injury was not fatal, it was not serious. The robbed passengers then reported to the Pinghu Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association on Lingji Street in Dadongmen, Nanshi. The directors of the association, Cheng Zengfeng, Xu Qingyang, and Cui Baolu, telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs yesterday, urging the Water Police Department to set a deadline to solve the case to ensure the safety of merchants and maintain the navigation industry. As for the injured accountant Cao Jiecai, he was not an employee of the Pinghu Ferry Company, but was specially dispatched by the Minnan Company to the Pinghu Ferry to supervise the ship's affairs. It is reported that the two companies have regulations in place to send people to supervise each other to prevent abuses.</p>

<h3>British Consulate Supports the Concession's Ban on Dog Racing</h3>
<p>From the letter of the Public Works Department to the South.</p>
<p>According to the *North China Daily News*, regarding the prohibition of dog racing, yesterday (19th),</p>
<p>The Public Works Department again exchanged letters with the British Consul General.</p>
<p>The British Consul General replied, expressing that the British authorities strongly supported the Public Works Department's decision to prohibit dog racing within the concession. The British Minister's view has always been that handling such matters is the responsibility of the Public Works Department.</p>
<p>Recently, some people who support dog racing have claimed that this type of gambling is permitted by British law. Although the British Consul General did not want to express an opinion on this point at this time, it is heard that recent cases heard in British courts have not proven that dog racing gambling is legal. In addition, Hong Kong and Singapore, British colonies, have not allowed dog racing, which is also a noteworthy point. The British authorities expressed sympathy for the Public Works Department's efforts to eliminate commercial gambling within the concession, and have long disapproved of the dog racing fields and do not want to see the British using extraterritorial rights to interfere with the Public Works Department's administration. According to the Yangjingbang Regulations, it is within the authority of the Public Works Department to regulate public entertainment venues. Since the Public Works Department has refused to issue licenses to the dog racing fields for good reason, if it now decides to order them to close, the British Minister also believes that this move is very beneficial to the concession.</p>
<h3>Xia Xi'e's Deep Night Humiliation Involves Litigation</h3>
<p>Two Women and One Man in a Room</p>
<p>Someone Snores Beside the Bed</p>
<p>Wang Guozhen Intends a Double Play</p>
<p>Wang Aizhen Knows No Shame</p>
<p>Xia Xi'e, a 21-year-old woman from Jiangyin residing at 2905 Nanfu Lane, Roberts Road, has recently hired a lawyer to file a complaint with the Special District Court against her fellow villager Wang Guozhen and a woman named Wang Aizhen for offenses against public morals and other matters. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Feng Shide opened the fifth court to hear the case, and both parties were present. According to Xia's statement, she was married but, due to poverty, rented a room on the front floor of Nanfu Lane with Wang Aizhen and her mother, Wang Wu. On the 23rd of the lunar December, Wang Guozhen, who claimed to be Aizhen's "older brother," wanted to stay there. On that day, Aizhen's mother, Wang Wu, was out working as a seamstress for a woman and did not return home. Aizhen proposed that she and I share a bed and let Wang Guozhen sleep alone on one bed. Because I was embarrassed to refuse Aizhen, I had to agree.</p>
<p>In the middle of the night, I suddenly felt that Guozhen was also lying next to Aizhen. I could not help but feel ashamed and indignant, so I got up by myself and slept on another bed. After Guozhen had a relationship with Aizhen, his lust did not subside and he crawled to my bed, trying to force himself on me and tearing at my clothes and pants. I was about to shout when Aizhen came to persuade me, saying that Wang would give me silver dollars later to buy new clothes. Although I come from a poor background, I still know etiquette and insisted on refusing, and asked Aizhen and the others to burn incense and repent the next day. Wang and the others agreed. The next morning, Wang and the others broke their promise.</p>
<p>I then reported the matter to the two landlords, Wang Zugen and his wife, and negotiated with them. Wang and the others then invited Zhou Jigen to mediate and were willing to pay 30 yuan as compensation. At that time, they gave Zhou 15 yuan and then gave 4 yuan the next day. On the third day, Wang and the others reported to the Putuo Road police station that Wang Zugen had been dismantling a beam, and the police arrested Zugen and sent him to court the next morning, where he was sentenced to one month of detention. But Wang's actions are really disgusting, so I filed a lawsuit. Wang Guozhen testified that on the night of December 23, he came to Shanghai to find his sister but did not find her. He went to his cousin Wang Aizhen's place to visit. Because it was late and he was unfamiliar with the area, his cousin persuaded him to stay for one night and then go to find his sister the next morning. I agreed, and Xia Xi'e and my cousin shared a bed, and I slept alone on one bed. I slept until the next morning when I went downstairs to leave, but the two landlords stopped me and accused me of molesting Xia Xi'e at night and intending to rape her.</p>
<p>They also gathered a crowd to imprison me and extorted 30 yuan. Because I was forced and had no way to escape, I first paid 15 yuan and then reported to the police station. I don't know Xia Xi'e at all. How could I rape her? Wang Aizhen's testimony was the same as Guozhen's, and she declared that she was a virgin and would not do anything rude.</p>
<p>Judge Feng said that the witness Zhou Jigen was not present today and ordered the case to be adjourned and ordered Wang Tan, the wife of the two landlords, to summon Zhou to court for questioning. Wang Guozhen paid 500 yuan for bail.</p>
<h3>Elementary School Principal Accused of Sucking Students' Semen</h3>
<p>The Student's Illness is Very Serious</p>
<p>A Widow Files a Lawsuit</p>
<p>Chen Wang, a widow from Changle Lane, Changan Road, Zhabei, brought her sixteen-year-old son, Wang Shidi, to the District Court, claiming that her husband had died many years ago and she only had this one son to rely on. The Xinguang Elementary School at No. 130 of the same lane opened a summer tutoring class last year, and my son went to study there. However, he gradually became thin and weak, and I was secretly puzzled.</p>
<p>By December of the lunar calendar last year, my son was already sick, and when I took off his pants to wash them, I unexpectedly found blood and semen stains on the pants. But my son had not yet developed, so I was puzzled and questioned him closely. According to my son, in June of last year, he was lured to bed by the principal Wang Shijie and Wang sucked my penis with his mouth. The second time was in December, and he was sucked until it bled. This kind of strange habit is inhumane. Now my son's illness is very serious and he needs two yuan of medical expenses every day, and he is about to be childless.</p>
<p>She demanded an investigation and offered the stained pants as evidence. Zhao, the prosecutor, summoned Wang Shijie yesterday. Wang, from Jiading, testified that he graduated from the Second Agricultural School in Suzhou and worked as the principal of Xinguang Elementary School. He completely denied the accusation. The prosecutor then ordered bail to be set, but Wang was unable to find bail at the time and was detained. It is now scheduled for continued investigation on the 24th of this month.</p>
<h3>The Public Works Department's Attitude Towards the Acquisition of the Dahua Hotel</h3>
<p>It is Inevitably Too Costly with Public Funds</p>
<p>It Does Not Benefit the Common People Much</p>
<p>The *Shanghai Evening Post* reports that the Public Works Department of the Public Concession does not want to take any action on the issue of the Dahua Hotel property at the Western Ratepayers' Annual Meeting. Unless a ratepayer proposes a motion to acquire the property as a city hall or park and it is passed by the meeting, this issue will not be raised again. According to reliable sources, the Board of Directors believes that the acquisition of the Dahua Hotel is inevitably too costly with public funds, and the result will inevitably lead to an increase in taxes. If it is converted into a park, it will only benefit the rich and not the common people much. Most directors do not agree to rebuild it into a new bureau, but if someone proposes it at the Western Ratepayers' Meeting and it is passed, the Board of Directors will not object.</p>
<h3>Negotiations for Reprinting *The Fate of Laughter and Tears*</h3>
<p>The Book Has Been Registered by the Ministry of the Interior</p>
<p>Counterfeit Books Seized in Beijing, Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Other Places</p>
<p>Lawsuits Have Been Filed in Local Courts</p>
<p>The novel *The Fate of Laughter and Tears* by Zhang Henshui was published by the Shanghai Sanyou Bookstore and exclusively sold by the Sanyi Bookstore. It has been registered by the Ministry of the Interior and issued a license No. 660 for distribution. Since its publication, it has been very popular. Recently, it was rumored that someone was privately reprinting it for profit. The company believed that since it held the copyright, it should strictly investigate. It sent people secretly to visit various ports and found that counterfeit reprints were being sold at the Zhongshan and Wulin bookstores in Hangzhou, the Xiaoshuolin and Wenyi bookstores in Suzhou, and the Capital Bookstore in Nanjing.</p>
<p>It immediately turned over the evidence to the police station for safekeeping and hired lawyers to file lawsuits in local courts according to law. The copperplate of the counterfeit book is blurred, the printing is poor, and the content is mostly disconnected and missing pages. The bottom page also does not have the red national emblem and copyright notice of the Sanyou Bookstore. The authenticity can be distinguished at a glance. However, the bookstores in the interior openly sell the counterfeit books for meager profits, and buyers are deceived without noticing. The reprinting is very hateful. The company, in addition to filing lawsuits in court to recover losses, will also notify special commissioners in various places to report infringements at any time to protect the copyright. It will also publish warnings in newspapers to warn all bookstores not to lightly attempt to print and sell counterfeit books.</p>
<h3>Vegetable Vendors on Ximen Road Moved into the Vegetable Market to Operate</h3>
<p>The Result of Persuasion by the French Concession Taxpayers Association</p>
<p>The vegetable vendors in the Ximen Road area of the French Concession were previously opposed by all the vendors in the vegetable market, and the shops in the area jointly requested the French authorities to ban them because they were obstructing traffic. The police station in charge implemented the ban in December of last year, and the livelihoods of the vegetable vendors were cut off. They elected representatives to petition party and government agencies and requested the Chinese Taxpayers Association of the French Concession to find ways to provide relief. It is now learned that the Taxpayers Association convened representatives of the vegetable vendors yesterday and persuaded them to move into the vegetable market to operate together and revitalize the vegetable market. It also asked the Vegetable Market Federation on Caishi Road to send representatives to negotiate the move-in procedures and persuaded them to work together in harmony. The representatives of all parties were very satisfied, and the Vegetable Market Federation has investigated vacant stalls and turned to the Public Works Department to issue licenses so that all vegetable vendors can move in to operate.</p>
<h3>City Public Works Bureau Cracks Down on French Tramway Dog Racing Advertisements</h3>
<p>Advance Warning: Vehicles Will Be Impounded Immediately for Violations</p>
<p>Dog racing is a form of gambling, and the municipal government is strictly cracking down on it.</p>
<p>Therefore, dog racing advertisements are also strictly prohibited. In December of the 17th year of the Republic [1928],</p>
<p>The City Public Works Bureau discovered French tramways operating in the Chinese area posting dog racing</p>
<p>advertisements and cracked down on them. In July of last year, French tram number six again</p>
<p>displayed such advertisements and was ordered by the Public Works Bureau to remove them. Recently, however, dog racing advertisements have been found again on French tramways operating on routes five and six. It is reported that the bureau has sent a letter</p>
<p>warning that if such advertisements are found again, the vehicles will be impounded to reinforce the ban.</p>
<h3>Music Prodigy Maktelna to Perform Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Performing Air Music</p>
<p>French music prodigy Mr. Maurice Martenot has devoted more than twenty years of painstaking effort to invent</p>
<p>air music and has self-manufactured, based on physics, chemistry, and electricity,</p>
<p>a type of radio wave musical instrument that he performs with everywhere, gaining the appreciation of music lovers in various places.</p>
<p>The governments of those places have also given him extremely generous</p>
<p>protection. In his first year, Mr. Martenot went to America, and Fox and Paramount</p>
<p>two film companies vied to hire him with large sums to perform and produce newsreels.</p>
<p>We were only able to see him on the silver screen, but ultimately could not personally</p>
<p>witness his divine skills. Now, Mr. Martenot has arrived in Shanghai at the earnest</p>
<p>invitation of friends in Shanghai and has chosen this Sunday and</p>
<p>Monday evenings to perform at the Carlton Theatre on Jing'an Temple Road.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the theater manager and Mr. Zhou Shixun jointly</p>
<p>invited consuls from various countries in Shanghai, as well as university and news reporters, to visit the theater</p>
<p>for a viewing. The guests were all extremely surprised and exclaimed it was a wonder to behold.</p>
<h3>Xu President's Car Accident Case Judgment</h3>
<p>Russian Fined Forty-Five Yuan</p>
<p>Xu Weizhen, President of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, on</p>
<p>the evening of the 26th of last month at 11:50 PM, was riding in his private car, number 8908,</p>
<p>driven by chauffeur Chen A'ming, returning from shopping outside to his residence on YuYuan Road.</p>
<p>While passing the intersection of Edinburgh Road and Seymour Road, he was suddenly struck head-on by a car number 7302 driven by a Russian man named Man Lie-na-lai.</p>
<p>Xu suffered minor injuries, and the glass doors and windows of his car were also damaged.</p>
<p>The Chinese police investigated and recorded the number of the offending vehicle and reported it to the police station.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the Special Court summoned the Russian to the Vehicle Affairs</p>
<p>Court, and the police station also sent a representative, lawyer Zhang Tianyin, to appear in court and</p>
<p>declare three points confirming the defendant's negligent behavior. After Judge Shen</p>
<p>questioned the defendant, he sentenced the Russian Man Lie-na-lai</p>
<p>to a fine of forty-five yuan as a warning.</p>
<h3>Three Fires in One Day</h3>
<p>A firewood and charcoal shop opened by Zhou Fuming, a native of Yancheng, at number 511 Haichang Road, Zhabei, caught fire at 1:30 AM yesterday morning due to carelessness,</p>
<p>spreading to neighboring numbers 512 and 513. The fire was extinguished after various fire brigades arrived and doused it.</p>
<p>On East West Huade Road yesterday morning at 10:40 AM, a rubber factory near Dixiwei Road on East West Huade Road</p>
<p>experienced a motor malfunction due to carelessness. The Hongkou fire brigade was notified and immediately drove to the scene and extinguished the fire quickly.</p>
<p>At 2:15 PM yesterday afternoon on Guangfu Road, people went to the Guangdong Guild Hall on Guangfu Road</p>
<p>to sweep tombs and burn paper money. Sparks flew and landed on</p>
<p>the roof of a nearby thatched shed, and the fire quickly flared up, spreading to more than ten buildings.</p>
<p>Gu Fucheng's tree shop at number 1541 and a row of bungalows were also</p>
<p>affected. The fire brigade drove to the scene and doused the fire, extinguishing it.</p>
<h3>Two Holidays for Factories in May</h3>
<p>May 1st and May 5th</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that the Shanghai Municipal Government has raised questions regarding the ambiguity of the Central Executive Committee's amended regulations on factory holidays, specifically regarding whether or not May 5th should be a holiday,</p>
<p>and whether or not Labor Day on May 1st should be removed. They submitted these questions to the Executive Yuan for interpretation. The Executive Yuan yesterday received an official letter from the Secretariat of the Central Executive Committee,</p>
<p>stating that the Standing Committee had already resolved in its 100th regular meeting that May 5th</p>
<p>is designated as a National Memorial Day and should be included in the annual factory holiday schedule. Furthermore, May 1st is also designated as a holiday by the Factory Law.</p>
<p>In addition to instructing the Shanghai Municipal Government to comply, the Executive Yuan has also directed the Ministry of Industry to notify the provincial and municipal governments.</p>
<h3>National Federation of Commerce Cables for Dredging of the Yangtze River</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce sent separate telegrams to the National Government Construction Committee in Nanjing, the Yangtze River Conservancy Commission, the Hubei Provincial Government Water Conservancy Bureau in Wuchang,</p>
<p>and other relevant bodies, stating, "Recently, we received a letter from nine groups, including the Yiyang and Yangxin</p>
<p>Chambers of Commerce in Hubei, which stated that the Great River, also known as the Yangtze River, flows from Sichuan into Hubei, from Yisha to Xinghekou, converging with the water from Dongting Lake in Hunan and reaching Xindi. Its source is mixed,</p>
<p>carrying silt. Numerous ships pass through, depositing coal ash. In addition, due to historical changes,</p>
<p>the embankments have been increasing daily, with farmers competing with the water surface for land. The river's shape has changed from a bowl</p>
<p>to a saucer, and the shallow water has caused silt to accumulate, forming islands. This is inevitable. Forty-five li upstream of Xindi is Luoshan. During the Qing Xianfeng and Tongzhi periods, it was a town with convenient river and lake access.</p>
<p>Later, due to river siltation, it became a dead port. In the river at Xindi,</p>
<p>there is only a line of sandbars. In recent years, the area has gradually</p>
<p>increased, starting from Zhujia and extending to Maobu Township, spanning more than forty li, dividing the river surface between Xindi and Jiayu County on the opposite bank into two sections, including Zhou,</p>
<p>Qingjiang Estuary and other places. The riverbed is silting up, and the islands are winding. During high water, the slightest carelessness may lead to grounding. If it is autumn or winter,</p>
<p>when the water is low, even small vessels have difficulty navigating. Military vessels and merchant ships are out of the question. Therefore,</p>
<p>last winter, a small boat from Xiantao capsized upstream of Xindi at Daoling.</p>
<p>The Jiali merchant ship ran aground on the old river surface opposite Xindi. Such incidents are too</p>
<p>numerous to count. At this time, with the beginning of political tutelage and the vigorous suppression of bandits, the throat of the Great River, connecting</p>
<p>Sichuan and Hunan above and reaching Nanjing and Shanghai below, is being allowed to be blocked by islands and silt. Not only will</p>
<p>Xindi become a second Luoshan, trapped in eternal ruin, but also the obstruction of the waterway will affect the commerce of Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang provinces and cities. Moreover,</p>
<p>in the event of a major military emergency, military vessels will have difficulty passing through, making it difficult for neighboring provinces to move troops to rescue each other,</p>
<p>like the head and tail of a Changshan snake responding to each other. This is still speaking of the inconvenience of transportation. If there is a flood,</p>
<p>causing a disaster and turning the land into a swamp, as far back as the Wushen and Jiyou years [1908, 1909] and as recently as the Yimao and Bingyin years [1927, 1928], dikes and embankments will be breached, fields will be flooded, and houses will be swept away. The lives and property of the people</p>
<p>will be eliminated by the giant waves. Although national funds are spent on relief, foreign loans</p>
<p>can never restore vitality. The reason is that the river is not dredged and is silting up day by day. Without this solution, even if we talk about construction every day,</p>
<p>it is like not grasping the root and only managing the branches. In the blink of an eye, the market towns will be flooded, the fields will be submerged, and the people will be displaced. What is called construction is like the hair without the skin, where can it be attached?</p>
<p>This is another meaning of the Great River's impact on water disasters. The late Premier Sun Yat-sen's teachings on dredging the river were detailed and insightful, and many can be verified.</p>
<p>We, the public groups, live in Xindi, and we are shocked by what we see. Regarding the interests and harms of this Great River, which are related to national planning and the people's livelihood, how can we remain silent? In addition to submitting separate reports to the National Government Construction Committee, the Hubei Provincial Government, and the Water Conservancy Bureau, we</p>
<p>hereby submit a document requesting that your association approve the transfer to various officials to send personnel to the Xindi</p>
<p>area along the river to conduct detailed surveys and regular dredging to promote water conservancy and strengthen</p>
<p>the foundation of the country. It is for the public good." Upon investigation, the dredging of the Great River is a matter of great importance.</p>
<p>We respectfully and unanimously advocate for appealing and calling for action to form a consensus and facilitate implementation. We await your reply.</p>
<p>The Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, Lin Kanghou, and Standing Committee Members Su Minsheng, Zhang Yuquan, Lu Guangji, Chen Riping, Li Kuian, and Peng Chuli, respectfully kowtow and stamp.</p>
<h3>Zhu Qinglan's Talks on Reclamation in Huainan</h3>
<p>Presenting Three Strategies</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu Ziqiao [Zhu Qinglan] has come to Shanghai to raise funds for disaster relief in Shaanxi. All sectors believe in his sincerity</p>
<p>and effectiveness in relieving disasters. Therefore, they have welcomed him and assisted in fundraising daily. In less than two weeks, he has already obtained a donation of 100,000 yuan. His enthusiasm for disaster victims and his credibility in society</p>
<p>are beyond description. Reporters from various newspapers knew that Mr. Zhu and Mr. Zhang Jian of Nantong were proponents of the Huainan salt pan reclamation project</p>
<p>and that he was also the chairman of a certain salt reclamation company. In recent years, the Huainan reclamation industry has long been doubted by society,</p>
<p>so they took advantage of Mr. Zhu's busy schedule to ask for his opinion. His remarks</p>
<p>should be welcomed by those who care about industry. They are disclosed as follows:</p>
<p>(Question) Sir, you have made great contributions to disaster relief in North China. I heard that you have been involved in reclamation</p>
<p>in Jiangbei. Have you paid attention to it in recent years? What is the situation now?</p>
<p>(Answer) The disaster area is too vast, and the disaster is too severe. We can only say that we have done our best, according to our conscience, to judge.</p>
<p>There are still many people who cannot be rescued, so how can we talk about merit? As for reclaiming the Jiangbei salt pans, I followed Mr. Zhang Si [Zhang Jian] and organized the</p>
<p>Huacheng Salt Reclamation Company. Later, I joined forces with friends to establish the Taihe Salt Reclamation Company. Taihe has been progressing steadily. Although it has not made a profit, it can still be sustained. Huacheng, on the other hand, made the mistake of having too little capital budget and the mistake of having chaotic steps taken by those in charge, resulting in</p>
<p>interruption midway. At this time, no one responded to increasing shares, and no one believed in lending money.</p>
<p>The only option is to maintain the status quo and wait for the opportune time. We also plan to submit all the land</p>
<p>to the government authorities as an experimental area for equal land ownership. Whether it can be implemented is still uncertain. Although I have not been personally involved in the company's affairs in recent years,</p>
<p>I have entrusted my most trusted friend, Mr. Zhang Peiyan, to be my representative. All matters are discussed by letter and telegram. Therefore, many difficult problems have been solved satisfactorily over the years.</p>
<p>If the company has a solution that can slightly reduce the disaster in North China, I will definitely go to Jiangbei to continue the work and will never be one who starts but does not finish.</p>
<p>(Question) The salt reclamation companies are all about ten years old or more, and the capital is hundreds of thousands or even millions, but we have not heard of any success. Why is it so difficult to operate this industry?</p>
<p>(Answer) Coastal land is formed by seawater accumulation, and its geological</p>
<p>evolution is slower than that of plains and mountains. The various methods of changing the geology</p>
<p>cannot be explained in a short time. However, because there is a certainty of improvement,</p>
<p>and because the region is in a densely populated area of Jiangsu Province with a mild climate,</p>
<p>the unprofitable or indebted state of the various companies engaged in operations has its own differences. However, regarding inadequate capital, incomplete projects,</p>
<p>inadequate equipment, and unfavorable environment, resulting in hindered progress and poor harvest,</p>
<p>the problems are almost the same. If we understand this, we will know that it is not that this industry cannot be done, but that there are various preventive factors such as timing, environment, and resources.</p>
<p>(Question) In your opinion, what measures should be taken to promote the success of the Jiangbei reclamation industry?</p>
<p>(Answer) The coastal area of Huainan, located east of the Fan Gong Dike, is no less than</p>
<p>ten million mu. With such a vast area, if the state were to operate it, like the Song Dynasty building dikes and constructing sluices along the coast,</p>
<p>this area of land could have long been transformed into fertile land. However, the authorities at that time did not consider this, so Mr. Zhang Si took the initiative to do it with private funds. Regardless of the difficulty in raising funds and the layers of obstacles,</p>
<p>the working plans were not unified, and the work was already illegal. Moreover, after various obstacles and setbacks, the situation of today was created.</p>
<p>In my opinion, there should be the following measures:</p>
<p>(1) The state should raise large sums of money to build dikes that have not yet been built along the coast, build sluices that should be built, and open trunk rivers that should be opened, so that the people can enjoy water conservancy. After the reclamation matures, either collect additional project fees or collect project fees together with the increased tax.</p>
<p>The people will enjoy the benefits, and the government funds will be repaid. This is a comprehensive planning approach.</p>
<p>The people will benefit from reclamation, and the public funds will be repaid. This is the best policy.</p>
<p>(2) If it is difficult to raise large sums of money and large-scale projects cannot be undertaken, then the existing companies should be given financial assistance separately, and personnel should be sent to supervise the money to ensure that it is not wasted and that the unfinished projects are completed.</p>
<p>The assistance should be given with a long-term repayment period. This is an approach that takes advantage of the situation.</p>
<p>The companies' previous efforts will not be abandoned, and there will be considerable results in the future. This is the next best policy.</p>
<p>(3) If the state does not have time for this at this time, then bandits should be eliminated to allow people to settle down and work, and taxes should be reduced to reduce the burden. This is a policy of recuperation.</p>
<p>Although there will not be rapid progress, there will be gradual progress. This is the minimum requirement. If even this cannot be achieved, how can we promote the success of the reclamation industry?</p>
<p>However, I still have one heartfelt word to offer to you, sir. When Mr. Zhang Si and I were engaged in the Jiangbei reclamation industry, the purpose was not to seek large profits for the shareholders, but to open up sources of profit for the local area.</p>
<p>It is hoped that all construction will be based on this development. Otherwise, the precedent of the reclamation and pastoral company is there. Who would be willing to invest for more than ten years without receiving interest? The world still regards them as large capital landowners, and their views are inevitably wrong.</p>

<h3>Six Records of the Burning of the Daji Steamer</h3>
<p>The Actual Number of Fatalities Exceeds Two Hundred and Fifty</p>
<p>The case of the Daji steamer of the Da Da Steamer Company, which was sailing to Zhanghuanggang and caught fire due to carelessness,</p>
<p>has been reported in previous issues. However, as of yesterday, it has been reported that the number of crew members and passengers who died in the disaster</p>
<p>has exceeded two hundred and fifty. The following is a record of the news received yesterday.</p>
<p>Hull Repair: The hull of the Daji was towed back to Shanghai by Chu Heng at approximately 5:00 PM on the 17th.</p>
<p>In the evening, it entered the Ruirong Shipyard in Yangshupu for repairs. Before entering the shipyard, the Water Patrol Team dispatched police officers</p>
<p>to inspect the ship together with the Navigation Association and the Customs River Authority. In addition to the remaining ashes, there were</p>
<p>five iron barrels containing salt. Because they were securely placed, they were not burned.</p>
<p>The shipyard has now refreshed and cleaned the hull and is surveying the bottom of the ship in preparation for repairs. The total repair cost is estimated to be more than 100,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Actual Number of Fatalities: Yesterday, a reporter from Guowen Newspaper investigated from various sources.</p>
<p>The number of crew members and passengers who died in this disaster is more than two hundred. The Daji</p>
<p>steamed from Shanghai through the major ports of Tongzhou and other ports. Some passengers boarded the ship without purchasing tickets,</p>
<p>and there were also free passengers and hawkers, making it impossible to verify the numbers. Therefore,</p>
<p>the number of bodies recovered by sandboats and company-dispatched salvage vessels in recent days</p>
<p>has already reached two hundred and sixty-seven or eight. Approximately</p>
<p>twenty or thirty more people are missing and have not yet been found. Therefore, the total number in the future will be between two hundred and seventy and three hundred.</p>
<p>Three More Coffins Arrive: For several days, boats have been transporting coffins back. The first</p>
<p>batch of eight coffins and the second batch of thirteen coffins all belonged to crew members and passengers who lived in Jiangnan.</p>
<p>On the 19th and 20th, Daqing and Dahe arrived in Shanghai, transporting three more coffins: (1) Li Asheng, head of the kitchen, from Zhoushan; (2) Pan Boqing, cook, from</p>
<p>Lanxi; (3) Passenger Zhou Dayin, whose family is in Shanghai, so they were temporarily placed in the Huaiyang Guild Hall. Yesterday, most of the coffins of the crew members who died in the disaster were transported back to their hometowns</p>
<p>on the Xinning Shaolun.</p>
<p>Continuing Reports: For several days, the Chonghai Fellow Countrymen's Association has been registering</p>
<p>the names of the deceased and missing persons. Some relatives were late due to delays en route, while others returned to Shanghai after searching in vain at the scene of the accident.</p>
<p>The association facilitates investigation. Therefore,</p>
<p>more relatives came in the past two days. The surnames are recorded on the left.</p>
<p>(Number of People Reported) (Native Place) (Deceased) (Total)</p>
<p>Wu Dafa Ningbo Younger cousin Wu Moufu One</p>
<p>Wang Lianfu Gaoyou Concubine Yin Baolin One</p>
<p>Li Gucheng Yancheng Father Li Jinrong One</p>
<p>Wu Jinxie Gaodeng Sister-in-law Wu Mao One</p>
<p>Zong Tingjie Zhenjiang Aunt Zong Zhang Tangdi Lin Two</p>
<p>Yan Yixuan Suzhou Younger brother Gao Heming</p>
<p>Han Changbao Shaobo Father Han Chunhai</p>
<p>Yan Bujin Yancheng Younger brother Bu Lan One</p>
<p>Company's Aftermath: For several days, the Dada Company has been holding board meetings</p>
<p>to discuss the aftermath. The details are complex and inconsistent between people and goods. The communications department has also consulted with the Jianghai Customs Supervision Office for investigation. Yesterday, the company submitted a document</p>
<p>explaining its aftermath plans. It is reported that the general approach can be divided into three parts: cargo and passenger losses. The company will consult with the Navigation Association to determine the amounts for freight losses. Crew members</p>
<p>will be compensated by the company. Passengers are registered and verified, and the company will consult with the fellow countrymen's association to handle the situation. The amounts are still being discussed and cannot be determined.</p>
<p>It is feared that it will take several more days.</p>
<h3>City Public Works Bureau to Examine Automobile Drivers' Licenses</h3>
<p>Starting April 1st</p>
<p>The City Public Works Bureau registers each automobile driver in the city and issues a driver's</p>
<p>license. Originally, examinations were conducted every full year. However, because the dates on which drivers</p>
<p>received their licenses varied, they often could not remember the dates later on. Therefore, it was revised</p>
<p>to designate April 1st to June 30th of each year as the license examination period to</p>
<p>standardize and facilitate memorization. Now that the period is not far off, it is reported that the bureau has begun</p>
<p>preparing the license examination procedures. It is also reported that if an automobile driver does not submit their license</p>
<p>to the bureau for examination, they will be fined five yuan if they are overdue for less than one month, and their license</p>
<p>will be revoked if they are overdue for more than one month.</p>
<h3>Movie Theater Almost Sued for Not Paying Stamp Tax</h3>
<p>Since the French Concession stamp tax has been handled by Specialists Liu Chunyuan and Shen Rulin,</p>
<p>they have simultaneously implemented both promotion and exhortation to drive sales and tax collection achievements are constantly improving. And even the rental revenue stamps have been gradually implemented. Regarding entertainment venues</p>
<p>and vehicle stamps, there has been a vigorous overhaul to eliminate favoritism. This is because it was found</p>
<p>that the French Concession movie theaters have been observing, delaying, and resisting filling out business forms and stamp tax payments monthly. The delay has been four months. Liu</p>
<p>and Shen submitted a report to the Jiangsu Stamp Tax and Liquor and Tobacco Office in Shanghai,</p>
<p>which sent a letter to the French Concession Patrol House. The patrol house immediately dispatched officer</p>
<p>Guo, an employee of the movie theater, for a stern warning. He was given three days to pay the back taxes</p>
<p>to the French Concession Stamp Tax Office. If he could provide written proof that he had complied, he would be exempt from prosecution. Otherwise,</p>
<p>he would be prosecuted according to the law. After receiving the order, Guo went to the French Concession Stamp Tax Office in Zhenping Lane</p>
<p>and pleaded repeatedly. He promised to pay the taxes owed for the four months of November, December, January, and February and to file reports and pay taxes monthly in the future.</p>
<p>Liu and Shen were invited to approve the matter leniently</p>
<p>and sent a letter to the General Patrol House to withdraw the charges and express their gratitude for the assistance. The movie theater's warning will serve as a precedent for other entertainment venues.</p>
<h3>Judgment on the Registration Rights of the Little Luzon Tobacco Factory</h3>
<p>Little Luzon's Old Beauty and Comet brand cigars have long been popular</p>
<p>and sold in China for more than forty years. It has recently been reported that</p>
<p>there are similar products in Hong Kong. The British government has ruled that the registration rights should belong exclusively to the Little</p>
<p>Luzon Tobacco Factory and that others cannot use them concurrently.</p>
<h3>The Seventh Volume, First Issue of Red Rose Published</h3>
<p>Red Rose is published and distributed by the World Book Company and has already reached its seventh volume, first issue.</p>
<p>It is a collection of original novels and was published today. Subscriptions can be placed at the company's main distribution center on Fourth Malu Road and at branches in various provinces.</p>
<h3>Shenchang Chinese Employees Hold a Dinner Party</h3>
<p>The American Shenchang Foreign Firm in this city is large-scale with a large number of employees.</p>
<p>The 31st of this month marks the 25th anniversary of the firm's founding. Chinese employees</p>
<p>have initiated a grand dinner party to celebrate and commemorate the occasion. It will be held at Fuxing Garden on Pingwang Street on the 28th of this month. At that time,</p>
<p>there will be noble songs, dances, entertainment, national arts, and theatrical performances to add to the fun.</p>
<p>It is also planned to permanently establish the Shenchang Chinese Employees Mutual Benefit Association to provide mutual assistance. Yu Xinyan, Jin Changkang, Lu Shixiong, Shen Zhaoxiong, and Ren Fengde</p>
<p>have been elected to draft the association's constitution and financial management regulations.</p>
<h3>Anhui Public Associations in Shanghai to Hold a Joint Meeting Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Anhui Native Place Association in Shanghai and various Anhui provincial trade, industry, study, and fellow countrymen's</p>
<p>groups in Shanghai are scheduled to hold a joint meeting at 1:00 PM tomorrow (the 22nd) at 6 Guling Road to discuss various important issues and report on the recent administrative facilities of Anhui Province.</p>
<h3>Trade Association News</h3>

<h3>Anecdotes of Coal Hill</h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>March 19th is the anniversary of Emperor Sizong of Ming's death on Coal Hill. The old calendar has been abolished, so this day coincides with the revolution of the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang on March 29th. I remember that in the past, people commemorated Sizong by attributing it to the birth of the sun, hence the beginning of their scripture: "The sun is bright, the light of Zhu Buddha," which is understandable.</p>
<p>People only know that in the year of Jia Shen (1644), the rebel Li Zicheng entered Xi'an. When he was about to cross the river, Li Jiantai was the supervisor who was supposed to suppress the bandits. Emperor Sizong personally went to Zhengyang Gate, held a cup, and said to him, "Sir, go forth as if I were going." However, before long, the troops retreated. Since then, cities fell one after another, not only Pingyang and Taiyuan. Moreover, in a conversation, the eunuch Du Xun had already surrendered to the rebels. Yet, the ministers of the capital, such as Wei Zhaode, remained silent. After the deaths of Xiong Tingbi and Yuan Chonghuan, it can be said that there was no one in the court. Therefore, when Emperor Sizong was dying, he said, "The monarch is not the one who brought about the downfall of the country, but the ministers are," referring to this.</p>
<p>After the year of Ren Wu (1642), the northern troops arrived at Heyang. Even before the western bandits invaded, the capital was already in danger. The only thing to rely on for defense was the Beijing Garrison, but its numbers were insufficient. Moreover, the city wall had more than 54,000 sections. The emperor knew that it could not be defended, so he ordered all the eunuchs below the seal-holding eunuchs of various supervisorates, regardless of age, to ascend the wall. After a long time, because there was no cooking, the so-called defending soldiers all left their posts to look for food. Meanwhile, rebellious eunuchs like Cao Huachun had long been in communication with the rebels. Even if there were loyalist troops, they could not protect an inch of land. Moreover, there was no one who could lead troops to rush to the rescue.</p>
<p>During the Wanli reign (1573-1620), taxes were already heavy, and the people suffered. But by the end of the Chongzhen reign (1628-1644), the various levies of the past, such as the Liaodong levy and the bandit suppression levy, could not be collected. On the first day of the Jia Shen year, the ministers reported to the emperor that the border defense expenses were heavy and there was no way to pay for them, and they all requested from the imperial treasury. The emperor was reluctant. Then, he tearfully summoned the Vice Minister of Revenue Wu Luzhong and asked if there was any silver in the treasury. Wu replied, "Only eighty thousand taels." Unable to do anything else, the emperor urged the officials to donate to the military expenses. The Earl of Jiading, Zhou Kui, who was also the father of Empress Zhou, possessed vast wealth but did not donate a single coin. Emperor Sizong subtly hinted to the Empress, and she poured out what she had stored in the palace to give to Kui, hoping he would understand the emperor's intention. However, Kui swallowed half of it and presented the rest. Yet, there was an old man, already sixty years old, who had never held an official position in the court, who cried bitterly and donated four hundred taels, accumulated from his blood and sweat. To say that there was no one who loved the country would be an inaccurate assertion. Alas, this is why I cannot stop writing after reading the last page of the Ming History.</p>
<h3>Lament for the Passing of Tang Meixi, a Master of Poetry, Due to a Love Suicide in the Moon Palace—I Only Learned of It From Shoujuan</h3>

<p>Wind and rain grieve for his literary talent.</p>
<p>Cuckoos cry in the clear moonlight,</p>

<p>Her intelligence deceived, missing her best time.</p>
<p>A true romantic soul in this world,</p>
<p>Regretting not meeting before she was married.</p>
<p>Arrows cluster, dividing the fields,</p>
<p>There are no good matches in this world.</p>
<p>The old poet understands the emptiness of beauty,</p>
<p>Yet still sheds a tear for the radiant red.</p>
<p>The drama of the resentful woman and infatuated man is heartbreaking,</p>
<p>How much karmic debt is hard to repay.</p>
<p>A passionate admonition to arrange,</p>
<p>Seventy-two lovebirds, thirty-six lines.</p>
<h3>Record of a Boy Scout Patriotic Speech</h3>
<p>— Ms. Ye Hua</p>
<p>It is said that General Baden-Powell founded the Boy Scouts, originally emphasizing civic and national training for children. Our country's Boy Scouts began in the second year of the Republic. Now, under the guidance of the Party, they are making greater efforts toward the goal of national training. The Shanghai Boy Scouts held the first Patriotic Speech Competition on the anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's death. This is an unprecedented grand event for our country's Party-affiliated Boy Scouts. I will record a few things I saw and heard to leave a trace.</p>
<p>▲Wang Jie's Anxiety: Wang Jie, a girl scout, won first place in the middle school group. This is a new era since our country started girl scouts in the fifth year of the Republic. Her main characterstic is liveliness, preferring movement to stillness. The order of speeches was based on the order of reports, and Wang's speech happened to be scheduled last. Watching her comrades take the stage one by one, she looked forward with anticipation, but it never seemed to be her turn. She was in a state of anxiety and impatience, like a tiger entering a cage for the first time, unsure of what to do with its hands and feet, then with her blood rising, her face flushed. Finally, she muttered the words of her speech. I sat beside her, seeing her anxiety, I felt anxious for her too. My heart was very uneasy. When the judging ended, Wang was actually ranked at the top. At this point, we suddenly realized that Wang Jie's anxiety was not without reason.</p>
<p>▲Yellow Clothing Psychology: After the photography was finished, someone asked why a certain Boy Scout was wearing a yellow hat and yellow clothes, almost everything on him was yellow. Someone said, "Preference for color varies according to ethnicity and individual. People tend to love the red and yellow ends of the light spectrum. Yellow is the most prominent color in the light spectrum, making people active and encouraged. In our country's feudal era, commoners favored red, and nobles favored yellow. Yellow was more honored than red. The emperor's clothes were called yellow robes, and edicts were copied on yellow paper, called yellow lists. The ground the emperor passed was paved with yellow earth, and from the roof tiles to the cushions, everything was yellow. During the Qing dynasty, even the national flag was yellow, members of the imperial family wore golden yellow belts, and ministers wore yellow mandarin jackets. It can be said that yellow reached its peak. Also, in ancient times, 'green clothes and yellow skirt' meant that the concubine was valued more than the wife, reversing the proper order of status. How noble is the color yellow! No wonder Boy Scouts love yellow. However, the yellow of the Boy Scouts has no noble or superstitious meaning, but only takes its active and encouraging aspects, using this to strive and forge ahead."</p>
<p>▲Iron Discipline: The competition was divided into group and individual. It was originally stipulated that each Boy Scout group should select two representatives to participate. However, this provision was dropped from the regulations due to a printing error. The only way to remedy this was to issue a notice. However, the notice said that two representatives should be selected, but mistakenly wrote "two people maximum," which was different from the original intention. The oral report beforehand stated that two people were the standard. But some people did not hear about it, so there were groups with one or two people present. This matter was quickly brought to the judging panel. The result was based on the written words, meaning that "two people maximum" meant at most two people could participate, one was acceptable, but three was not. Fortunately, the scores of the one person were sometimes lucky and sometimes unlucky, which was very fair. So, one person was allowed to represent the group. After the judging was completed, the winning group in one group was represented by one person, and those who had two people present could not help but feel disappointed. However, they could only obey the decision without any objection. Such discipline is worthy of praise. Disputes in competition arenas are common both at home and abroad, and have become commonplace. This competition had room for dispute, but no one disputed it, which is a deep demonstration of the Boy Scouts' virtues.</p>
<h3>On Fan Fanshan</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Mr. Fan Fanshan passed away on the fourteenth of this month. Heaven was unwilling to spare him, and an elder statesman has withered away. A poetry master of his generation, his elegant style has faded. The birds sing in sorrow. Mr. Fan was a resident of the capital for many years. Surrounded by chaos and political turmoil, Mr. Fan, along with Luo Yinggong, Yi Longyang, and others, composed poetry and drank wine, forgetting the world. After Luo and Yi went to heaven one after another, Mr. Fan felt quite lonely. His body was originally healthy, but in recent years he gradually showed signs of aging. Last year, he accidentally ate "Ma Da Gun" (馬打滚) and fell ill. "Ma Da Gun" is a local food from Jiangxi province. It is made by steaming glutinous rice flour until cooked, then shaping it into a cake. After it dries and hardens, it is cooked in water until it becomes porridge. It is called "Zi Ba" (粢粑). Then, sugar frost and bean and wheat flour are taken and placed in a bowl. The Zi Ba is put into the bowl, and the sugar frost and bean and wheat flour naturally adhere to it. It tastes sweet and delicious. It is called "Ma Da Gun" because of its shape. But his aging and weak stomach could not digest it, causing him to be bedridden for many days. Therefore, there were rumors outside that Mr. Fan had passed away. It was an inaccurate rumor about "Dongpo of the Overseas." Mr. Fan laughed it off. Mr. Fan had a romantic and beautiful nature. Even in his later years, he still liked to compose poems about beauties, giving the impression of a glance behind a fan, captivating all. His depictions of feelings were like paintings, enchanting and unforgettable to read. My friend Xu Ziya admired his poetic talent and treated him with the respect due a teacher. At that time, the game of poetry riddles was popular in Shanghai. Ziya often went to ponder them. One day, the riddle was a poem by Fan Fanshan. Ziya was very familiar with his poems, so he wrote the answer. He also copied the answers of others and concentrated them in his own. When the answer was revealed, it was indeed Ziya who got it right. He won four hundred gold coins, which was a wonderful story at the time. Senior Zhang Danweng has a small portrait of Mr. Fan that was given to him. I had the opportunity to see it. He looked thin and dignified, wearing formal attire and thick-soled court boots. It was probably taken when he was an official during the Qing dynasty. Mr. Fan's documents and letters have already been published. His remaining poems number over 30,000, and someone will soon publish them. In the early years of the Republic of China, Mr. Fan often submitted his poems to newspapers for publication. I also loved to read Mr. Fan's poems and would record and save them whenever I saw them. I still have one or two handwritten copies in my travel bag, all of which are Mr. Fan's masterpieces. Mr. Fan passed away at the age of eighty-six.</p>
<h3>Epitaph for the Late Mrs. Wang</h3>
<p>— Hu Yuan of Xiangtan</p>
<p>The deceased Mrs. Wang, whose given name was Jian, and courtesy name was Yunxiang, came from a Wang family originally from Shanyin, Zhejiang. During the Qing Jiaqing and Daoguang eras, they came to Hunan and settled in Changsha. Her father's name was Benchang, and her mother was Madam Tong. Madam Tong was widowed early and had two children, whom she raised and taught according to proper etiquette. Mrs. Wang followed her mother and was raised by her grandmother (玉母), known for her filial piety and careful selection of a spouse. She married Yuan Shuo as his second wife at the age of twenty-seven. Yuan Shuo's family was poor and did not engage in production. After returning from studying in Japan in the Guangxu Renyin year, he was distressed by the precarious state of the country and founded the Mingde School. For more than twenty years since then, he was constantly traveling abroad, not returning home for the entire year. Even when he did return, he did not have time to rest, constantly seeking solutions. He entrusted all the affairs within the family to Mrs. Wang and did not concern himself with them. Mrs. Wang managed everything calmly. With refined elegance and high moral standards, she wore simple clothes and ate simple food, avoiding servants and maids, and operating with ease. The room rarely had hidden savings, and the pantry was often empty, but nothing was left undone. Gifts from relatives and parties were always properly distributed. Yuan Shuo was able to focus on running the school, and people also recognized that Mrs. Wang was virtuous because the Yuan family lived so plainly and was able to endure hardships. Mrs. Wang had no worldly desires, but only loved reading books. She held a book in her hand every day, forgetting the cold and heat. Her poems, lyrics, and parallel prose were mostly worth preserving. Yuan Tan once recorded them in a volume called "Late Sunny Collection." She also had several handwritten "Admonitions to My Sons," based on morality and offering comprehensive and insightful advice, with many words that could be emulated. In her later years, she devoted herself to Buddhism, and her temperament became even more tranquil. She was taciturn and rarely spoke. Although her body was weak and prone to illness, she would always conceal her illness and avoid causing trouble. This summer, she passed away from a minor illness a few days before the Xiang turmoil began. At that time, Yuan Tan was in Beijing, and was unable to return home due to the chaos. Alas! Mrs. Wang was born on the twenty-eighth day of the eighth month of the Guiyou year of the Qing Tongzhi reign and died on the fifth day of the fifth month of the Gengwu year of the Republic, at the age of fifty-eight. She had three sons: Mu, who studied economics at Keio University in Japan and obtained a bachelor's degree, marrying Zhang; Yi, who studied education at the University of Chicago in the United States and obtained a doctorate, marrying Shuai; and Zheng, who was enrolled in the National Conservatory of Music and was engaged to Chen. She had one granddaughter. She was buried on a Wushen day in the mid-winter of this year, at the original site of Shiguchou in Daxian Town, Changsha, facing Yi (乙) in the first direction and Xin (辛) in the foot direction. The inscription reads:</p>
<p>Oh, virtuous spouse, truly my good friend.</p>
<p>She was as composed as a quiet maiden, as industrious as a weaver woman.</p>
<p>Frugal yet adhering to propriety, possessing substance with elegance.</p>
<p>Her words formed chapters, praising her pure virtue.</p>
<p>How could it be that one day, she would rest forever?</p>
<p>If it weren't for the turmoil, who would have known Buddha's power?</p>
<p>Her radiant beauty is concealed, her clear zither's sound is left behind.</p>
<p>This stone records her chastity, and my heart is filled with sorrow.</p>
<h3>Random Musings on Europe (6)</h3>
<p>— Wang Yachen</p>
<p>Among the works of French masters in this museum, the four large murals by Chavannas are particularly noteworthy. They are embedded in the four walls next to the three-story escalator. Each mural is about thirty feet long and five feet wide. Not only are the depictions solid, but the subjects are also very meaningful. The first mural depicts the era of Greece, depicting the glorious scene of ancient Greek art. The background is filled with characters from Greek mythology. The second mural depicts the Roman era, depicting the glory of the Roman era, dominated by magnificent Roman architecture. The figures in the painting are all nude, enjoying a sense of natural intoxication, expressed vividly. The third mural depicts the era of religion, depicting the glorious scene of religious art. A group of believers are making murals in a church, evoking the sincerity of that time towards religion. The architecture in the painting all uses Roman-style arches, which immediately show the greatness of the Roman religious era. These three murals were made in 1885. There is another mural by the door, depicting the first ancestors of mankind, Adam and Eve, forming a decorative pattern of symmetrical shapes. The color and composition are elaborately designed. The above four works are truly Chavannas's best works. To the left of Chavannas's murals is a large room displaying Italian and French paintings from the Renaissance to the end of the 18th century, totaling more than a hundred pieces. Among them is a nude woman by Robert Sterl, whose technique of applying color is very similar to Tie Qing (Titian). This is the best Italian painting in the room. Besides this, the Italian paintings displayed are not masterpieces. Among them are several copies by great French painters, which are worth noting. 1. Manet's copy of Delacroix's "Dante's Boat," originally number 200, is displayed in the Louvre Museum in Paris. Manet only used a number 6 canvas for the sea, but he was able to express most of the feeling. 2. Delacroix's copy of Correggio's "Holy Image," originally an eighty-figure work, is also displayed in the Louvre Museum in Paris. Delacroix used a small number 5 canvas to copy its general human figures and clothes, all of which had the same feeling as the original. The skill of the technique and the depth of the color are impeccable. 3. Delacroix's copy of Tie Qing's famous "Descent from the Cross," the painting is only number 6, but it does not lose the spirit of Tie Qing's original work. In the past, all the great painters in Europe, during their exploratory period, lingered in the Louvre Museum in Paris, conducting in-depth studies of the works of ancient masters. In the past, those who copied paintings only followed the general outline of the original work and used their own techniques. Copying according to this method is indeed of great benefit to one's own technique. Writers whose basic conditions of their own technique have already been resolved will not be confused by the original work when copying ancient paintings. Seeing the copies by Manet and Delacroix, I feel that the work of copying paintings is meaningful. After visiting the paintings upstairs, I went downstairs again and saw sculptures displayed, totaling more than ten rooms. There are many famous Italian sculptures and reproductions. Although they are not as precious as the famous Italian sculptures, they are enough for art lovers to study. After the sculpture room, I went upstairs and saw modern French works displayed. Each of the famous painters in Paris has one or two works displayed. The museum must close at noon. By the time I finished visiting, it was almost noon, and I had not had time to record everything. I left the museum and took a car back to the vicinity of the British hotel for lunch. After lunch, I strolled along the river. The background of the river is mountains, and the trees are neatly planted on both banks. Looking into the distance, the houses are densely packed, and the prosperity is no less than Paris. There are more ships sailing in the river than in the Seine in Paris. Because the area is commercially prosperous, the transportation is also more lively. I walked along the river for four or five miles and then returned to the hotel for a short rest. I took the special express train back to Paris at 3:14 PM.</p>

<h3>Gold Speculation Returns to a Weak Path</h3>
<p>America Has News of a Silver Famine Relief</p>
<p>High Winds and Rough Waves: Extreme Danger: Gold speculation on March 20th once again took a weak turn, with extreme and unpredictable ups and downs. The difference between the opening and closing prices was seventeen or eighteen taels, causing extreme nervousness. The result was a sharp drop of thirteen taels, although the exchange rate continued to shrink by half a point, the internal market was already flooded. This was truly a divergent trend of external tightness and internal looseness. The prices of spot market trades were very different. In the morning, Yuan Maoyong, Tong Taichang, Xin Heng, etc., were all buyers, while Chang Sheng Yong, Qian Changxiang, Cui Changyong, etc., mostly sold. Overseas silver markets all reported declines, but the gold price instead fell. The reason for this was that America seemed to have the intention of relieving the silver famine, as well as the stimulation of the Japanese cabinet turmoil. Afterwards, the ups and downs of over ten taels near 700 taels became unbearable. In the afternoon market, prices were initially stable, then weakened, as the selling pressure was very strong. With the increasing supply of bills of exchange, prices plummeted by more than ten taels, almost to the point of collapse, finally breaking the 690-tael mark. The British gold price has settled at four pence, which has become a stable situation in recent days. However, both long and short positions are very dangerous. The spot market also seemed to soften, with a premium of about eight taels for term trading.</p>
<p>The Market Opened with a Drop and Became Complicated: The May contract opened in the morning with a drop of five taels, at 698 taels. The long-term price fell by sixteen and nine-sixteenths cents, the deferred price by only one-half cent. Private telegrams were down by sixteen and eleven-sixteenths cents, so the market sentiment was down. Then, Yuan Heng and Tong Taichang bought in, and the price rose to 703 taels. Suddenly, it fell by seven taels as Da Decheng, Zhi Fengyong, and other firms sold out, reaching 695 taels and five cents. In an instant, it rebounded by ten taels because Fu Yu, Shunli, Yuan Maoyong, Wanxing, and others competed to buy. The settlement price was announced at 706 taels, and the listed price had shrunk by 125 US dollars. The gold price was up by one and a half cents on the 25th because banks were doing June British gold futures at 87.5 to 7.5. After a while, there was a difference of two taels, but Yiyu and Hengyu sold out, and Dehua quoted June at 93.75, so the price at 9:30 AM was 698 taels. Later, as Tong Taichang, Yongheng, Fu Yu, etc., bought in, and Mitsui absorbed 1.54375 taels from Dalian, the price immediately rose at 10:20 AM to 703 taels. After that, the turmoil was overwhelming, and the selling was heavy, as Qian Changxiang, Changyong, Yuan Maoyong, and certain speculators were inclined to unload their positions. With the slump in British gold, Zhengjin and others bought four pence in deferred deliveries, and the gold price fell precipitously by twelve or thirteen taels, until at 11:00 AM it was only 689 taels and five cents. Suddenly, it was learned that Mitsui and HSBC were doing May British gold futures at 1.39375. Then, Zhejiang absorbed 87.5, and Yuan Maoyong, Fu Yu, Yongfeng, and others joined the chase, the price suddenly rose by more than twelve taels, reaching 702 taels at noon. However, there were varying ups and downs in between, with fluctuations of one or two taels. The noon closing price was 701 taels, continuing to rise to 03 to 04 taels. The situation was drifting, making it difficult to grasp. The listed price was changed to 753 taels, a difference of about 50 taels. Afterwards, it was 63 to 64 taels, and the closing price at noon was 50 taels outside.</p>
<p>Bills of Exchange Weakened, and the Market Showed Signs of a Collapse: The market opened in the afternoon at 705 taels, the remaining momentum after the noon closing. Then, it was 06.5 taels. After a while, the Indian exchange rate fell and then rose by eight annas, and the price immediately fell to 694 taels, with Xing and Shen Xing selling out. However, there were few buyers on the table. After that, it rose and fell, with the price fluctuating between 97 and 91.5 taels at 2:30 PM. Later, British gold tended to weaken, and Mitsui and others quoted 93.75, so the gold price continued to fluctuate by five taels. At 2:30 PM, it was 97 taels, and at 3:20 PM it was 91.5 taels. The fluctuations of the various firms were erratic. At 3:30 PM, the Indian exchange rate rebounded by four annas, and the price rose again to 97 taels. However, Chang Sheng Yong, Yuan Maoyong, Yongfeng, Hengyu, and others jointly sold off their positions. With the slump in British gold, with a quote of 1.4 possible, the price plummeted by eight or nine taels in just half an hour. At 4:00 PM, it was 688.5 taels. At this time, the Dalian gang and goods took the opportunity to drag in, and the price was pulled up by three taels, to 91.78 taels. However, as the market sentiment was unstable, and sellers still unloaded their positions, there was another round. Tong Taichang, Zhi Fengyong, and others sold out, and the price fell to 88 taels. Then, two or three taels were added. At the 4:30 PM closing, it was 690 taels, a drop of twelve taels from the previous day. After the closing, there were further fluctuations of two or three taels, with prices fluctuating between 91 and 88 to 89 taels, then rising to 91 taels. The maximum price for the day was 706.5 taels, and the minimum price was 688 taels, a difference of 18.5 taels. The early price for goods was 99 taels, the noon closing price was 700 taels and 005 cents, the afternoon price was 05.5 taels, and the closing price was 80 taels and a half. The settlement price was reduced by 63 to 64 taels. The ledger prices for the morning market were 94 taels for March, 97 taels for April, and 701 taels for May. The afternoon market prices were 83 taels for March, 86 taels for April, and 90 taels for May. The water supplement was 94 taels, and the afternoon market was 83 taels.</p>
<p>Transactions were Extremely Complicated: Among the transactions within the industry, Yuan Maoyong, Fu Yu, Xin Heng, Yuan Cheng, Yuan Heng, Yongfeng, Shunli, and Tong Taichang were all buyers. Heng Xing Yuan, Wan Xing, Fu Taiheng, and Zhi Fengyong were selling and buying. Yuan Tai, Qian Changxiang, Yu Da, Cui Changyong, and Chang Sheng Yong were all sellers. In the afternoon, Da Decheng, Zhi Fengyong, Shunli, Yongfeng, Qian Changxiang, and Yu Da had varied fluctuations. Yuan Heng, Yongheng, and other accounts were all buyers. Wan Xing, Tong Taichang, Yuan Tai, Heng Xing, Chang Sheng Yong, Tai Xing, and Cui Changyong were all sellers. Fu Taiheng, Yu He, and Tai Fengcheng made few purchases and sales. The Dalian gang bought a total of more than 2,500 shares and sold more than 2,300 shares. A small number were sold by the Guangdong gang.</p>
<h3>Major Fluctuations in Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>Shifting with Gold Prices, Diverging Trends in Open and Black Markets. Yesterday, the British, American, Indian, and silver markets all reported declines, but the market was flat. British and American exchange rates rose to the rates posted by HSBC. Various exchange rates also contracted by half a notch. The calculations were: £125 for British gold, $1.3625 per shilling; $25, calculated at $31.625; ₹75 for Indian exchange, calculated at ₹87.25; 7 yuan for French francs, calculated at 808 yuan; 1 yuan for German exchange, calculated at 132.75 marks; 75 and foreign, calculated at 78.75 shields; adding 1.25 taels to Singapore exchange, calculated at 177.5 taels; Hong Kong remained the same, calculated at 77.75 taels; adding 1.5 fen for Japanese gold, calculated at 1.5625 taels. However, the domestic bank market diverged. It was stable in the morning, but then the gold market showed weakness, and later it fluctuated uncertainly. It was flat at noon, then stable in the early afternoon, and then declined. The gold price had broken through the 690 taels mark, but the fluctuations were too great to grasp. By the afternoon close, compared to the previous night, British gold was up 0.1875, American dollars were up 0.375, and Japanese gold was down 2 fen. It was truly a divergence of shrinking openness and releasing darkness. The situation was the opposite of the day before. Transactions by Chinese merchants were still brisk, but supply exceeded demand. The turnover of British gold still totaled £300,000. Chen Fengyong and others continued to settle, and bank payouts were appropriate. In the morning, Hua Bi, Mitsui, Sumitomo, and others sold, while Mitsui, Sumitomo, Hua Bi, Maihang Zhengjin, and others bought tirelessly. Transactions were not smooth in the afternoon, but Shanghai, Mitsui, Anda, Hua Bi, and others all sold, while Mitsui and Sumitomo absorbed slightly. It was said that interbank trading was not quiet, and only 200,000 to 300,000 yuan of American dollars were traded, and only tens of thousands of yuan of Japanese gold. Mitsui slightly increased its intake, and the market was almost in a revolving situation.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Yarn Sales Gradually Developing</h3>
<p>The yarn market is in good shape, and the market trend is tightening. The spot yarn business is thriving, and all gangs have intentions to buy, with the Sichuan gang purchasing the most smoothly. As a result, people are shaken, and the prices of overseas three-grade yarns are tens of taels higher than those of Chinese yarns. Therefore, Shenxin and Yong'an factories in China are increasing their exports of cotton yarn and cloth, which is also good news for Chinese factories. Therefore, large households have an unusually strong intention to purchase and receive goods, so the market is very stable, but most sellers are doing their best to dump their large inventories. However, judging from the general trend, the marked yarn may be stabilized.</p>
<p>The human label situation is gradually improving. The pre-market opening of the human label market was dull, and then the situation was particularly tight in the second and third rounds. All months rose by 6, 7, 8, and 9 qian. In the afternoon, the news of good spot sales made the market situation even more tense. All months rose by 2, 3, and 6 qian. At the close, with the gold price falling back, the transaction volume totaled 25,400 bales. It was found that Baoji sold 1,400 bales, Rongxing 700 bales, and Changfeng 950 bales. Gengfeng bought 1,600 bales, Tianlong 1,600 bales, and Xincheng 500 bales. The closing price of the human label is recorded on the left.

Among the customer gangs, Sichuan entered 800 bales, the mainland 200 bales, Tianjin 200 bales, the northern gang 80 bales, Hong Kong 300 bales, the oil head 35 bales, and miscellaneous gangs 250 bales.</p>
<h3>The Cotton Market Has No Major Advances or Retreats</h3>
<p>The cotton market trend is slightly calm due to flat actual sales. Various factories are silent, but the exchange rate is difficult to turn around, so some people are still firm, and the bottom goods are thin, so the pulling force is still tight. The future depends on the exchange rate and foreign cotton for advancement and retreat.</p>
<p>The Han label is stable and quiet. The Han label market opened tightly in the early market due to the shrinking exchange rate and stable foreign cotton. All months rose by 2 to 3 qian. In the afternoon, it was heard that the gold market was falling, and cotton fell by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan. The transaction volume totaled 52,500 dan. It was found that Changji sold 2,000 dan, Jifeng 1,800 dan, Tongxing 3,000 dan, Shenda 2,700 dan, and Jinfeng 3,000 dan.

<p>April: 4010, 0.15, 65,500. July: 4000, 0.25, 878,000. Cotton demand is bleak. Spot cotton transactions are still sluggish. Various factories are very lazy to handle it. Sources: Yao cotton 750 bales, Tong cotton 130 bales.</p>
<p>American seed cotton 44.00. Yong'an Factory entered 200 pieces. Spot goods were sent to the factory.</p>
<h3>Foreign Cotton Yarn Sees Mixed Ups and Downs</h3>
<p>American cotton is still not energetic. Yesterday, the American cotton market was dull, and all peers took a wait-and-see attitude. Futures rose and fell by 1 to 2 pounds. Spot prices did not move. British cotton futures rose by 3 points, and spot prices rose by 8 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 15 points. Indian cotton was firm at first due to purchases by brokers, and then tired due to sales by speculators. Pingguoer's near-term and long-term prices rose by 2 rupees. Aomula rose by 2 rupees in the long term and 1 rupee in the long term. Bairoxi rose by 2 rupees in the long term and 1 rupee in the long term.

<h3>Food and Rice Market Steps Down</h3>
<p>Yesterday, about number 40 of the river boats arrived in Zhabei, and the market sales were still stagnant. White japonica rice showed a weak trend. Telegrams from the inner roads reported softening. The stores here were fully stocked, and the limelight of all the steamed buns has passed, so people's hearts have turned lax, and the price is stepping down by half a jiao. The top of the market is opening at 13.23 yuan. The sales of thin indica rice were mediocre and also tired by about a jiao. However, Yangdu glutinous rice was still in a fixed situation, and transactions were flat. The buying air of Tongbian Yin Yuan was stagnant and wooden, but the high-quality goods still had a way out. The middle and second grades saw no improvement, and the overall market returned to near the scale.</p>
<p>Yesterday in Shanghai South, more than 20 numbers of sources from inner roads had different sales venues. Although the market appetite for Chang Gang white japonica rice was receiving, the price was tired by a jiao. Su and Tong white japonica rice sales were quite stagnant, and the market also softened by about a jiao. However, special goods could be said to be immovable. The customer sales of Nan Gang thin early rice were tending to be quiet, and only a small number of local street transactions saw a reduction of half a scale. The market was flat with no rise or fall in the rare arrival of Yangdu sharp rice. The receiving taste of Yin Yuan from various parties was not refreshing, and the price was showing signs of weakness.</p>
<h3>Starch Market Sales Show a Hint of Beauty</h3>
<p>After the market opened yesterday morning and afternoon, the market for each month showed a slight firm and stable look. Although the quoted price of foreign wheat fell slightly by a jiao, the exchange rate gradually shrank after the gold price rebounded. The order for foreign wheat has stopped. Moreover, major manufacturers seemed to intend to wait and see, and stopped throwing together. Although small and medium-sized manufacturers also followed suit in releasing stalls, their power was weak, and the market had no impact, and the step was rising. According to this kind of situation, it may be possible for the market to be a little higher. However, the biggest key still depends on the strong growth of the gold price. As a result, this month was 0.025 yuan better than the previous day, April was 0.015 yuan better, June was 0.05 yuan better, July was 0.075 yuan better, and August was 0.01 yuan better.</p>
<h3>Wheat Multi-Party Step Out This Month</h3>
<p>After the market opened yesterday morning and afternoon, the market for each month showed a slump. The quoted price of foreign wheat was small, and the transaction in this month was already close to delivery. The multi-heads outside the industry were all expected to close. It was heard that the actual amount of multi-air double sides was more powerful. There were only two manufacturers preparing to receive goods, about 100 vehicles. In addition, the non-industry multi-head had to close step by step. In the long run, the family heads in each month were also offering stalls in the afternoon. It was the pricing of a few days ago that was sold out at this point. Therefore, each month fell again and again. As a result, this month fell by 0.06 yuan compared with the previous day, April fell by 0.035 yuan, and the second, six, seventh and eighth months fell by 0.03 yuan. The current wheat market opened yesterday with 200 bags of Mingguang wheat at a price of 3.45 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Coarse Sand and White Continued to Rise by Two Qian</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market reported that the current sugar price was 1.3125, slightly higher than 0.0625. New York futures sugar rose by 4 points in March, 5 points in May, 1 point in September, and 1.52 in December, rising by 2 points. The Rotterdam sugar market was quite strong, and there were not many transactions. The transaction price was 10.03 yuan, which was 0.03 yuan higher than the previous day, and the households were very scarce. The medium sand white market also shouted high, but there were not many buyers, and the market was flat. Japanese sugar transactions were smoother. N 10.01 yuan, 10.03 yuan. SH 9.75 yuan. YP 10.02 yuan. YT 10.0 yuan. TK 10.0 yuan. YRO 9.6 yuan. After more than a thousand bags were traded, the sellers tightened and the transaction price gradually increased by 0.05 yuan. The buyer's absorption was still strong, and transactions were frequent.</p>
<h3>Silk Tea and Silk Factory Stagnation Head is More Popular</h3>
<p>There are 106 silk factories in Shanghai, and only about 4/10 of them are currently in operation, resulting in a daily reduction in the output of silk factory stagnation heads. However, the European demand is still strong, and the mainland sales taste is also not weak, resulting in insufficient supply and the market is becoming more popular. Yesterday, the high-quality goods were already opened at 24.5 yuan, and there was still a lack of giant scenes for supply.</p>
<h3>The Piece Goods Slightly Reveal Signs of a Turning Point</h3>
<p>The cloth market in this factory is gradually rising, especially the fine cloth is the hardest. Yesterday, more than 300 pieces were traded, resulting in a sharp increase in the asking price. Yanghe, Caqiu, Laba Tong, repeated openings of 7.3 yuan. The blue double fish has been sold to 7.4 yuan. The blue flying fish can still be stabilized and sold for 7.8 yuan. There are also searches for fine oblique broken households, and the price has also risen. Yanghe is 7.275 yuan, and the blue double fish is 7.15 yuan. However, the squirrel has 6.85 yuan, and there are still hand goods. The coarse cloth is also hard, and the 11-pound three rabbits and three deer have been sold to 5.45 yuan. The 16-pound goods are even more lacking. The current goods of Five Cranes are out of stock, and Peony is sold for 8.1 yuan. Due to the suspension of weaving by the new factory, the current goods of 13-pound double horses and horse dogs are also becoming increasingly rare.</p>
<p>Since the opening of the eastern and western piece goods, there has been no day without a decline. The eastern goods are even more depressed. The reason is that the gold market is falling, the hand goods are full, and the actual sales are also shrinking because the asking price is too high, resulting in a lower and lower trend. The turning point came yesterday, because the gold market was slightly stiff, the hand goods were reported to be tight, and people's hearts turned better. Yesterday, the tribute ne rose by 0.05 yuan, and the English Qianshan Lieyan were all 0.35 yuan. Shuangtong Deer was 0.32 yuan. The Four Gentlemen rose sharply to 0.295 yuan due to the increase in the unified tax. Fine weaving was also slightly rebounded. The Changsha Gang was quite active in wool silk cloth. Sanmatou was 2.85 yuan, and Sangong was 2.75 yuan. If the remaining original ocean yarn, bleached cloth, and fine cloth have risen slightly.</p>
<h3>Hardware, Flower Garden, Lead Wire is Extremely Quiet and Thinking of Moving</h3>
<p>More than 2,000 dans of Hunan lead arrived yesterday. The flower garden lead wire market has been deserted for a long time, so there is no transaction to record in the market. However, the trend is very quiet and thinking of moving. The export to Tianjin, Qingdao, Dalian, and other gangs have all made purchases, so the market is quite lively. Although the standard has not seen an increase, it has been very stiff, estimated to be 5.25 yuan per, checked that more than 2,000 bundles have been released in the past two days, and there are still a lot of people who will purchase in the future.</p>
<p>Hubei lead has recently arrived in large quantities. Yesterday, Taikoo Jinli also arrived with more than 2,000 dans of spot goods. There is more and more inventory on the market. Although the tea gang has some movements, the number is not enough to enter the bid. It is only sold for 16.5 yuan, which is about 1 yuan lower than the red market.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous News: 1,740 pieces of glass came from Belgium.</p>

<h3>Marshal Foch's Diary of the European War (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Gu Angruo</p>
<p>The two nights of the second and third were relatively silent. On the third, the German army felt weak and began to bombard Ypres in an orderly manner. This was their habit in this situation. At other times, they could only carry out local attacks and had no effect. The war situation on the fourth was also the same.</p>
<p>Now it can be said that their combined attack on Ypres has failed. Although their army and ammunition far exceeded the Allied forces, their struggle against the stone wall of the Allied forces has collapsed. They cannot continue to fight. The German General Staff had to shrink its ambitions.</p>
<p>The enemy felt that it could not overthrow the Allied forces' defense with a full-line general offensive, nor could it occupy the important center of Ypres to directly attack the coast. Therefore, it now wants to change its attack to the two pivots of the convex angle of our defense line, one to the north of Ypres and one to the south of Ypres.</p>
<p>Although the strategic victory that the enemy wanted to achieve was not successful, it could at least consolidate its western front in Flanders with a tactical victory and turn to attack Russia.</p>
<p>It can achieve this goal without occupying Ypres, because attacking both ends of the convex angle can allow it to move artillery closer to the north and south sides, hindering our traffic centered on Ypres and forcing our troops to withdraw from the semi-circular front line.</p>
<p>In this way, after the fierce battle in the east of the city, the two armies will fight again on its north and south sides.</p>
<p>Starting from the fifth, people gained the reinforcement of a new division and launched a large-scale attack to the south of Wesque when we were advancing towards Messines. In the north, the enemy's third reserve army successfully launched a war against Bisquique and Langemark. The remaining enemy troops were not active.</p>
<p>The Battle of Ypres ended on the 13th. The German army attacked the north and south pivots to subdue the convex angle, leading to two major battles that lasted for several days without a victory.</p>
<p>On November 18, the two armies returned to their original defense and the front line was completely stable.</p>
<p>After the war, we immediately took the opportunity to reorganize the army. The commander-in-chief transferred a large number of reinforcements, making it easier for us to start.</p>
<p>Most of our soldiers have been trapped in a dilemma, and their replacement is imminent. I am now beginning to negotiate with the Flanders commander-in-chief on the division of the front line and the deployment of the Allied forces. After several days of deliberation, we reached an agreement on the areas for which each army is responsible for defending.</p>
<p>Because we still cannot be sure of the enemy's situation, we therefore often use aircraft and cavalry to scout whether the enemy has a retreat. We also asked the Dunkirk naval authorities to scout the location of the German army's coastal batteries to the north of Nieuport. After several scouts, we learned that the enemy's trenches were very solid and encountered rifle and artillery fire everywhere. The naval reconnaissance did not dare to venture into the submarine mine area.</p>
<p>The German army is generally holding its ground, impregnable.</p>
<p>The Allied forces have been fighting in Flanders for a long time, the war zone is wide, the participating army elements are complex, and the number of people is not very large. They often arrive slowly and are easily mixed up. Under such complicated circumstances, without unified command, and conducting mixed battles based on the outline and observing the situation clearly, victory is impossible to grasp. There is also one thing whose功不可磨灭 is the most effective contact between the Allied forces and the commanders of each army. This is just another manifestation of the spirit of cooperation of the Allied forces.</p>
<p>The Allied commanders can often meet each other during the day. Every night I ask General Dubail to come to Wanmat to discuss our military affairs and prepare the orders for the next day. His headquarters are located in Lusseburg. At about 10 o'clock, Sir Henry Wilson often brings the war report from the headquarters of the St. Amiens English Army to Cassel, my headquarters, and reports the plans of Commander-in-Chief Flandre for the next day. We are also closely connected with the headquarters of the Belgian Army in Fournes.</p>
<p>The motto of our British Allied forces to be united to have strength has never been more completely implemented than this time. This is the secret of using the weak to defeat the strong and holding on for a full month to achieve victory.</p>
<p>I naturally often have close contact with my commander-in-chief. Although I have not seen him since November 2, we exchange opinions every day. Although he has always recognized the importance of the Flanders war, he could not immediately send sufficient troops. His army has been exhausted after two months of fierce fighting. They also lack ammunition, and he has to consolidate the weak front line. The front line is expanding very quickly, and now the front line from Vosges to the Lys River is 375 miles long.</p>
<p>The scope of the front line is so wide that the two armies are in close contact everywhere, and there is a possibility of bombardment everywhere. These facts are the reason why the reinforcements continue to arrive to participate in the Ypres War. They are also the reason why the participating armies have to fight for a long time, only because there are no other armies to replace them. But they were still able to persevere in the entire evil war, which is really commendable. Now two examples can prove it.</p>
<p>The British First Army has suffered heavy losses since October 31. On that day, it had already begun to retreat, but it stopped and fought back, and its courage was a hundred times greater. The enemy attacked repeatedly and failed. In the end, the enemy was indeed contained and then left the battlefield on November 18.</p>
