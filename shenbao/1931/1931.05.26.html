<p>白里安之外交政策爲法政府共定之國策亦爲法民衆共表同情之政策故此次選舉總統而後總理賴伐爾即聲明法之外交政策决不因此變更而白里安亦即毅然赴日内瓦擔當國際間折衝之任如對德奥對蘇聨等重要問題仍發表其堅决之主張以冀外交政策之始終一貫可見白氏並未因未得總統而稍表示消極也迨白氏由日内瓦會畢返國民衆熱烈歡迎爲向所未有而賴伐爾總理欲使白氏貫澈其外交主張至欲提出總辭以讓彼組閣是白縱有意消極而以民衆擁護政府督責之故亦决不終於消極也蓋今日歐局安危之重心在法而法之能當折衝之任者祇有白氏一人情勢固巳顯然倘法於此時更易外長即政策不變國際間亦必起種種疑障如前日白氏落選之消息傳至日内瓦議塲中之空氣驟形緊張一若外交形勢將有重大變化故法政府與議會苟不欲更易其外交政策者必不肯更易外長白里安知法外交關係之重大者亦必不肯輕言辭職然則連日所傳白里安之消極辭職說又何爲乎來哉</p>

<h3>日减俸案</h3>
<h3>形勢益趨險惡</h3>

<p>各省官吏以辭職相恫嚇</p>
<p>鐵路大罷工有實現可能</p>
<p>路透二十五日東京電　減俸問題有促成風潮之勢其結果殊難預料行政省官員連外省在内巳呈請政府勿加實行且以辭職爲恫嚇惟陸海兩省未加入此項運動鐵路僱員月薪多在八十五元之下故不在减薪之列但若輩仍作罷工之恫嚇顯恐政府第二舉將裁員也政府方面並不以局勢嚴重而示弱惟或將稍稍略改辦法行政各省雖或一致反對减俸但全國各鎭村領袖今日午後在東京開民衆大會通過贊成减俸之决議案其理由顯爲商業凋敝久無起色農民收入大减而官員反享高俸也</p>

<p>路透二十五日東京電　江木鐵相諭鐵路局各課長渠未能考慮路員反對减俸之請求殊覺抱憾尙望路員原諒盡力維持適當秩序因鐵路爲人民日常生活中之要需也路員現已表示其避免磚及公共便利之意故衆意罷工可不發作如竟從事罷工政府或將調出陸軍鐵路隊以便辦理路務政府雖議定採行戒備計畫以防意外然决定不採取締目前鼓噪之行動近來經濟蕭條民衆各方面收入皆减獨政府俸給迄未受影響是以政府認减俸爲救濟國家財政之最公允辦法故似巳决計實施此議</p>

<p>肺癆療法之新發見</p>
<h3>德國肺病療養雜誌抄譯</h3>
<h3>何謂肺癆菌</h3>
<p>肺結核菌（卽肺癆菌）係桿狀之細菌其體形眞直或稍彎曲長徑約一迷達之百萬分一五非肉眼所能見據一定之方法以熟練之手段製爲染色標本用六百倍至一千倍之顯微鏡檢視之始克窺知實爲極小之物也</p>
<p>古昔之時中國名之曰癆咳蟲現今則人皆知結核菌爲肺病之蟲不屬於動物界之系統蓋吾人之周圍有無數之下等微生物存在卽通稱么微有機體爲肉眼所不能見此么微有機體分爲動物性與植物性二種屬於動物性者曰原始蟲屬於植物性者曰黴菌此下等植物之黴菌屬於隠花植物之一科無葉綠素黴菌之中又視形狀性質分爲「絲狀黴菌」「芽性黴菌」「分裂黴菌」之三種</p>
<h3>肺癆菌之殖民政策</h3>
<p>分裂黴菌之繁殖本諸自身之分裂作用卽自一而化爲二自二化爲四日漸增加故有分裂黴菌之稱人類及他種動物往往因之發生疾病故稱曰「病原菌」因形狀之不同又分爲「球狀黴菌」「桿狀黴菌」「螺旋狀黴菌」之三種肺癆菌卽分裂黴菌中之桿狀菌</p>
<p>肺癆菌在肺病患者之痰中混之最多常視患者病勢之輕得而有增減據德國海角雷兒博士謂肺病患者之痰一塊中含有三萬萬之結核菌故小時内咯痰一次者一晝夜中有七十二萬萬之結核菌自結核患者之體内而排出散布於空氣中世間之人日夜被其侵襲然此多數之病菌果何自而生乎蓋分裂菌之本體有分裂作用已如前述其日漸增加繁殖者職是之故起始時原屬一個黴菌其後日漸分裂由一爲二由二爲四依次遞推增殖之勢力日漸廣大今試假定增殖之速力每一小時營分裂作用一次則二十四小時内一個之黴菌已化爲一千六百萬個矣由是以觀則下述之事項可推測而知</p>
<p>（一）黴菌繁殖力之如何旺盛</p>
<p>（二）究因何故而患者之體中發生無數病菌</p>
<p>（三）患者之痰究因何故而有無數之肺結核菌</p>
<h3>肺癆菌之抵抗力</h3>
<p>肺結核菌之抵抗力非常强盛推知其抵抗力之大小爲肺病豫防及治療上之最緊要者結核患者之痰放置空氣中時結核黴菌之生存可達半年以上置於光線缺乏之暗室内則一年以上尙得保其生存此種黴菌對於寒冷之抵抗力尤爲强大遇攝氏零下十度之寒冷經六七星期而不死對於温熱之抵抗力亦較他種黴菌爲强他種黴菌遇攝氏六十度之温度經二三十分鐘便行死滅而此種黴菌須八十度之温度經二三十分鐘始克死滅惟對於日光之抵抗力最爲荏弱遇直射之日光經五六分鐘便死遇攝氏百度以上之温熱一二分鐘便死若就消毒藥而論肺病患者之結核菌在二十倍石炭酸水中歴三十秒鐘而死在百倍石炭酸水中歷一分鐘而死在千倍昇汞水中歷十分而死</p>

<p>蓋肺結核（卽肺癆）之原因是結核菌而此菌一入人體内則於該處便成結節以斷血行之路又結核菌能分泌一種抗酸性蠟質包圍其體以防禦一切外來藥力之侵人故雖用種種殺菌藥内服或注射終不能達其病菌之實體内歷來醫家所慣用之自然療法對症療法理學的療法血清療法藥劑療法及其他一切治療法等尙未完全成功而肺病無藥之說徧滿於一世者因未知此深奥學理故耳由此現代結核學者根據上述之學理繼續研究不遺餘力結果竟成此殺盡肺癆菌之化學聖劑名曰三那星Sanosin此藥係遵肺癆菌發明者德國考克博士與肺癆菌脫蠟術發明家德國柏格爾博士之最新醫理而發明成功者據現下德國瑞士及其他各國諸肺病療養院之實騐報告此藥有滲透肺病竈之結節及溶解蠟質之作用兼具有殺菌力能根治一二三期之肺癆確有萬試萬靈之特效在中國業經國民政府中央衛生試騐所化騐藥性和平無毒絶無任何副作用茲略舉醫治作用於下</p>
<p>（一）設於試騐管中實騐「三那星」之藥力作用則一分鐘後結核菌皆消失其抗酸性至三分鐘後則此肺結核菌完全殺盡無一倖免</p>
<p>（二）依動物試騐則發見「三那星」能滲入結核病竈内設檢查其病竈内濳伏之結核菌則盡失其抗酸性此足證明其蠟質之完全溶解矣</p>
<p>（三）如患者内服「三那星」一星期左右則立見咯痰稀釋體熱下降等良好狀態</p>
<p>（四）更繼續内服「三那星」達三十天至六十天以上則顯見體重增加食慾激進一切症狀逐漸緩和終達其回天再造之偉功</p>

<p>如逕行接受嚴重取締</p>
<p>記者因上海公共租界工部局决定將銀七萬餘兩補助界内各私立學校一事關係重大特往訪市敎育局徐局長茲記其談話如左</p>
<p>工部局並無管理租界内敎育之權至其自設之華童公學三民小學四所課程與訓育均不遵照中央敎育宗旨及標準辦理視租界爲化外言之殊堪痛心本局對於華童公學等現正籌劃收回其管理權工部局近因市民攻擊不得已爲掩飾起見乃有補助私校之舉一則以少數之金錢冀博得民衆之好感一則藉名補助以竊取管理私校之權其計誠巧而且險矣且聞其所欲補助者不僅在租界範圍之内且有在越界築路區域内者則其侵犯我國主權更甚總之工部局以常年一千六百念一萬兩之收入而用諸華人敎育者不過三十餘萬兩較之市政府以六百五十萬元之收入而敎育經費竟達一百零六萬元之鉅者相差何啻倍蓰本局認爲工部局對於華人敎育經費實有儘量擴充之必要但其經費之支配權則應歸諸本市維一之敎育行政機關即木局是也故此次補助私校辦法在工部局未商准本局以前各私校如有逕行接受補助費者定行從嚴取締云云</p>

<p>Eurasia Airmail Service</p>
<h3>Time and Postage</h3>
<p>Before the Sino-Soviet meeting in Nanjing reaches a conclusion regarding the issue of Eurasia Aviation passing through Russian airspace, the method for transporting mail is for the Eurasia Company to use aircraft to transport it to Manzhouli, from where it is transported by train to Moscow. After arriving in Moscow, it is transported directly to Berlin by aircraft of the German-Russian joint venture aviation company. It is estimated that the combined transport schedule from China to Berlin will take six days at the fastest. The company has stipulated that the aircraft will arrive in Manzhouli in one and a half days. However, the train from Manzhouli to Irkutsk departs at half past noon every day, so the aircraft needs to arrive in Manzhouli before noon to connect. As for the postage issue, the company stipulates that each item weighing less than twenty grams will be charged two jiao for every thousand kilometers. For example: (1) A letter from Shanghai to Berlin weighing less than twenty grams will be charged six jiao. (2) A letter from Hankou to Berlin will be charged eight jiao. (3) A letter from Chengdu to Berlin will be charged one yuan. As for postage from Berlin to China, the charge is eight jiao regardless of the destination, which is exactly the same as the value of one European franc. (Special dispatch on the 25th)</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>The Resignation Rumor of Briand</h3>
<p>Briand's foreign policy is the national policy jointly determined by the French government and the policy of sympathy jointly expressed by the French people. Therefore, after this presidential election, Prime Minister Laval declared that France's foreign policy would not change because of this, and Briand resolutely went to Geneva to take on the task of international coordination. On important issues such as Austria-Germany and the Soviet Union, he still expressed his firm views, hoping that the foreign policy would be consistent from beginning to end. It can be seen that Mr. Briand did not show any pessimism because he did not win the presidency. When Mr. Briand returned from the Geneva meeting, the people warmly welcomed him, which was unprecedented. Prime Minister Laval wanted Mr. Briand to implement his foreign policy so much that he wanted to propose a general resignation to let him form a cabinet. Even if Bai intends to be passive, he will not end up being passive because of the people's support and government supervision. Today, the center of gravity of European security lies in France, and Briand is the only one in France who can take on the task of coordination. The situation is already very clear. If France changes its foreign minister at this time, even if the policy remains unchanged, it will inevitably raise various doubts internationally. The atmosphere in the Geneva discussion field suddenly became tense when the news of Bai's defeat in the election was transmitted, as if there would be major changes in the diplomatic situation. Therefore, if the French government and parliament do not want to change their foreign policy, they will not be willing to change the foreign minister. Briand, knowing the importance of France's diplomatic relations, will certainly not lightly speak of resignation. So, what is the origin of the rumor of Briand's passive resignation that has been circulating for days?</p>

<h3>Japanese Salary Reduction Case</h3>
<h3>The Situation Grows Increasingly Dire</h3>
<p>The Authorities are Determined to Enforce Their Position</p>
<p>There is Fear of Precipitating a Political Crisis</p>
<p>Provincial Officials Use Resignation as a Threat</p>
<p>A Railway General Strike is Possible</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 25th: The issue of salary cuts has the potential to incite unrest, and the outcome is difficult to predict. Administrative officials, including those in outer provinces, have petitioned the government not to implement the cuts, using resignation as a threat. However, the Army and Navy ministries have not joined this movement. Railway employees mostly earn below 85 yuan per month and are therefore not included in the salary cuts. However, they are still threatening to strike, apparently fearing the government's second step will be layoffs. The government is not showing weakness in the face of the serious situation, but may slightly modify the approach. While administrative provinces may unanimously oppose salary cuts, leaders from towns and villages across the country held a public meeting in Tokyo this afternoon and passed a resolution supporting salary cuts. The reason given is that commerce has been stagnant for a long time, farmers' incomes have greatly decreased, while officials continue to enjoy high salaries.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 24th: The Home Minister, Railway Minister, and Finance Minister discussed for a long time and decided not to abandon the original plan for salary cuts due to threats of resignation from railway staff. Tomorrow, the cabinet will hold a special meeting to discuss this matter. At night, Railway Minister Ekami summoned Vice-Minister Aoki for talks, apparently to persuade Aoki to communicate with the chiefs of the railway bureau and reconsider the resignation resolution to avoid a large number of resignations leading to a serious situation.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 25th: The government's salary cut proposal has just been decided, and protests have spread across the country, causing anxiety for the cabinet. However, 400 employees of a certain factory, mindful of the business slump, voluntarily requested a salary reduction. The factory initially did not allow it, but after repeated requests from the employees, they agreed to a 10% reduction. This move could save the company 36,000 yuan per year.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 25th: The Emperor of Japan is scheduled to return to Tokyo by train this afternoon. The authorities fear that railway staff will oppose salary cuts and take unexpected actions, so they have taken special precautions to ensure the safety of the tracks. A railway strike is possible. Employees of the Ministry of Communications, post offices, etc., have also reportedly said that they will stop working if salary cuts are implemented. It is expected that the government is currently planning methods to deal with any possible events.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 25th: Railway Minister Ekami instructed the chiefs of the railway bureau that he was unable to consider the railway staff's opposition to salary cuts and felt deeply regretful. He hoped the railway staff would forgive him and do their best to maintain proper order, as the railway is essential to people's daily lives. Railway staff have now expressed their intention to avoid disrupting public convenience, so it is generally believed that a strike will not erupt. If a strike does occur, the government may deploy the army railway unit to handle railway affairs. Although the government has agreed to adopt precautionary plans to prevent accidents, it has decided not to take action to suppress the current uproar. In recent times, the economy has been depressed and incomes have decreased in all sectors of the population, but government salaries have not been affected. Therefore, the government believes that salary cuts are the fairest way to alleviate the country's financial difficulties, so it seems to have resolved to implement this proposal.</p>

<h3>His Position Remains Unclear</h3>
<p>One Account Says His Decision to Resign is Firm</p>
<p>Another Says He Will Form a Cabinet</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Paris, 24th: It is still difficult to ascertain the position of French Foreign Minister Briand at this time. The enthusiastic welcome he received upon returning from Geneva was unprecedented, indicating strong public support. However, after a long conversation with Prime Minister Laval, his friends claimed today that Briand's decision to resign was very firm and could not be reversed. However, it is also widely rumored that Laval will propose a general resignation at the cabinet meeting on Wednesday and recommend Briand to the President to form a cabinet. Furthermore, Briand himself visited several political party leaders, such as Loucheur and Danilou, before leaving the capital to go to his home in Cocherel for a holiday, indicating that he is not yet tired of politics.</p>

<p>An Exquisite Declaration from a Female College Student in Serbia</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Belgrade, 24th: A most interesting trend has recently emerged in Yugoslav education. The director of a famous women's university has prohibited students from wearing powder and rouge. The students were in an uproar, organized a "Twelve Sisters Committee" to engage in resistance, and sent representatives to visit the Minister of Education. The Minister refused to see them. The students were even more indignant and published a declaration in major newspapers in the capital, stating that they were determined to strike until this medieval ban was lifted. Their declaration included these exquisite words: "Rouged lips, painted nails, and disheveled hair are more important to us than obscure and useless Latin and Greek. We do not want to be as ugly as our grandmothers. We all want to get married, and a diploma filled with knowledge is far less useful than a beautiful appearance." However, the authorities were not persuaded by their eloquent arguments and expelled the striking students. Public opinion on this matter is divided, and a heated debate is currently underway.</p>

<p>Telegram</p>
<p>Nanjing Telegram: All newspaper offices are aware that internal troubles have not yet subsided, and the public desires governance. The period of political tutelage has just begun, and construction is in full swing. It is appropriate to work together in times of difficulty, cooperate to discuss national affairs, complete unification, and adapt to new opportunities. However, I hear that suspicions have suddenly arisen in Guangdong, with accusatory telegrams inflaming matters and invading the central government. I do not understand the difficulties of the authorities, and the brewing of internal strife only increases the suffering of all parties. Judging from their erroneous arguments, they cannot avoid sensationalizing rumors. Considering their true intentions, I feel that they harbor separate views. Generalissimo Chiang is loyal and diligent to the Party and the country, and his integrity is as clear as the sun and moon. The public yearns for peace and harmony; how can they wish for the obstruction of dust and haze? At this time, when people's hearts are not at peace and the flames of red are spreading, the fundamental plan lies in urgently seeking governance. We must adhere to the fundamental plan, pledge loyalty and steadfastness, praise Yao and Shun while remaining vigilant, and not forget our duties. I only uphold my consistent aspirations and encourage my humble loyalty. I respectfully lead the entire army and await further orders. I hope that comrades of the Party and the country will unanimously advocate this, so that hidden troubles can be eliminated and all can move towards the right path, in order to demonstrate righteousness and consolidate the foundation of the country. I respectfully dispatch this telegram and pray for your examination. Respectfully, Tian Songyao, Commander-in-Chief of the Twelfth Route Army.</p>
<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Central Party and National Government Memorial Week</h3>
<p>The Panchen Lama Speaks on the Relationship Between the Government and Tibet</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang Reports on the Course of Opposition to Alignment with Russia</p>
<p>Central Party Headquarters: At 9:00 AM on May 25th, the KMT Central Party Headquarters held a memorial week for the late Sun Yat-sen in the auditorium. Central Committee members Ding Weifen, Liu Luyin, Zhang Qun, Fang Juehui, etc., as well as staff from various departments and offices, and guests, totaling approximately 500 to 600 people, attended. The Panchen Lama also led several Khenpos and other attendants to participate in the memorial. Chairman Ding Weifen presided over the ceremony. The Chairman reported that the National Assembly had passed the provisional constitution and many important proposals in the shortest possible time, and its spirit and achievements were recognized by people at home and abroad. The most important of the resolutions passed by the Assembly was the acceptance by all representatives of the National Assembly of Sun Yat-sen's complete legacy. Sun Yat-sen's doctrines and policies, which could previously be said to be the doctrines and policies of a part of the Chinese Kuomintang, are now the doctrines and policies that are jointly followed by the people of the entire Republic of China, and it is an unprecedented union of the people of the entire country and the Chinese Kuomintang. Before the National Assembly was convened, many people feared that it would not be able to gather as scheduled. However, representatives from various provinces and cities came as quickly as possible, and the quorum was reached at the time of the opening, which shows that the people of the country yearn for peace and unification. They wish to use the power of the Assembly to seek long-term peace and stability for the country, eliminate the phenomenon of disintegration, and reduce the suffering of the people. However, unfortunately, during this period, an incident violating peace and unification occurred in Guangdong. The Central Government has decided to resolve the changes caused by some misunderstandings through political means and in a peaceful way, and will definitely not expand it. I hope everyone will work with peace of mind and strive to carry out the political tutelage and construction undertakings to achieve the goal. Next, the Panchen Lama gave a speech, translated by Gesang Zeren, saying: "I have been in the Chinese land for nine years. This time I came to the capital and saw the prosperous political atmosphere and the spirit of the National Assembly. I have infinite optimism for the future of the country. Since the Tang Dynasty, Tibet has been protected by Chinese politics, and the payment of tributes and the exchange of envoys have long become inseparable. The Yellow Sect is presided over by the Dalai Lama and myself in Tibet, and the regions have a certain division. Under the protection of the Chinese government, there should be no disputes. Previously, due to internal disunity, Nepal once invaded Tibet. If it were not for the protection of the government, it would have been difficult to avoid being on the brink of danger. Looking at the recent situation, politics and religion cannot be separated. If Tibet leaves the government, it will not be able to protect itself. If the government loses Tibet, it will inevitably suffer the loss of its teeth after its lips are gone. Recently, there are still disputes in Kang and Tibet, and transportation is cut off. I hope the government will use political power to promote a solution as soon as possible to achieve stability. I have long wanted to contribute the situation in Tibet and Xinjiang to the government and the people of the whole country, but because the country has been in trouble and the situation has been unstable for many years, there has been no suitable opportunity. Now that the foundation of the central government has been consolidated and the representatives of the National Assembly have gathered, I have come to admire the national glory and present everything to the government and all my compatriots. I deeply hope that special attention will be paid to the suffering of the border people, so that it can be relieved as soon as possible. Although I am not a member of the Party, I firmly believe that the Three People's Principles are the only good policy for saving the country and the people, so I absolutely believe in them. Mongolia and Tibet should also be urged to jointly believe in them. The spirit and strength of religion have always been the foundation for maintaining the survival of Mongolian and Tibetan society. If the complete legacy of the Premier can be instilled in the hearts of the people of all ethnic groups and carried out without contradiction, then the culture can be advanced and all suffering can be relieved." The meeting adjourned at 10 o'clock after the speech.</p>
<p>National Government: At 10:00 AM on the same day, the National Government held a memorial week for the late Sun Yat-sen. Chiang Kai-shek, Shao Yuanchong, Zhu Peide, Wang Shuhan, Shao Lizi, Zhang Qun, Jiao Yitang, Wang Zhengting, Zhang Jinghui, the Panchen Lama, Ma Fuxiang, Chiang Tso-pin, Liu Shangqing, He Yaozu, Ru Yuili, Lin Xiang, Zhu Luxian, Chen Qicai, Chen Shaokuan, Zhou Yawei, Li Shuhua, Zhang Weihua, and officials from the National Government's civil service, military, accounting, and other departments, totaling more than 300 people, attended. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek presided over the ceremony. Chiang reported on the course of opposing the alignment with Russia and said that we should, of course, respect our old comrades in the Party who are truly loyal, but if old comrades oppose the new comrades and oppose the doctrines of the Party, we should work hard to eliminate them. I hope that government colleagues will understand the current environment and past history, follow the resolutions of the National Assembly, and strive to build so that everything is on the right track to unify China and complete the revolution. The meeting adjourned after the report.</p>
<h3>Shang Zhen Distributes Compilation Expenses to Various Armies</h3>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: Shang Zhen brought funds back from Beiping this time, and the issue of compilation expenses can be barely overcome. In recent days, Shang has been discussing with Yang Aiyuan, Sun Chu, etc. It is planned that starting from today, the headquarters will close the office, first review the salary slips of various departments, and then order the grain and clothing bureau to transfer them to the provincial bank for issuance. Feng Pengzhu has already departed from Shouyang and is coming, and Wang Jingguo is also scheduled to return from Sui in two or three days. It is heard that the tasks of Feng and Wang are both to negotiate the issue of compilation expenses. The situation of the armies in southern Shanxi has become tense recently due to problems with daily food and provisions, and all parties are paying close attention. Song Zheyuan returned to Taiyuan last night (21st). According to him, Chief Commanders Chiang and Zhang have promised to issue the salaries of their troops on a monthly basis, so the issue of salaries for their troops will naturally not be a problem. The funds previously advanced by various counties will be repaid as soon as the military expenses are received. The current maintenance method will have to wait until consultation with Chairman Shang before a decision can be made. I plan to return to southern Shanxi in a day or two. Shang Zhen's attitude has become increasingly positive recently, and he is determined to be responsible for the reorganization of Shanxi currency. Once the entire plan is drafted, it will be announced to the public. (May 22nd)</p>
<h3>The Disputes Between the Various Factions in Guangdong Province</h3>
<p>It is Difficult to Expect the Establishment of a Military Government</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Since Guangdong expressed its change of heart, the organizers initially planned to start with military affairs first, and leave other party unification and politics as the second step. Therefore, there was news that a military government would be established on the 20th. However, the leaders failed to agree on the deadline, so it could not be realized. There is also a saying outside that the establishment of a military government must be legally produced by the highest party headquarters. Therefore, the theory of party unification cannot but become a prerequisite. According to the opinion of the Zou Lu faction, it is advocated to recognize the enlarged meeting. The Gu Yingfen faction advocates maintaining the Nanjing legal system. The leaders of various parties have different opinions on how to convene the highest party headquarters in the future, and it is inevitable that they will hesitate. As for the organization of the military government, the opinions of various factions are divided. Deng and Gu and others advocate adopting a committee system. The military government is further divided into four committees: military, political, financial, and foreign affairs. Each committee is staffed with three or five members, but some people oppose it, so it is still unknown whether it can be established. Those who are currently in charge of military affairs plan to cancel the name of the Eighth Route Army after the establishment of the military government and change the serial number to a certain army. In recent days, the military leaders of Guangxi Province have successively arrived in the province. Bai Chongxi arrived in Guangdong on the 17th and had several meetings with Chen Jitang. There is no specific plan for the military liaison between the two Guangs. Zhang Fakui, who has been stationed in Liuzhou, Guangxi Province, also arrived in the province at around 4:00 PM on the 19th. Zhang was summoned by Guangdong dignitaries and started from Liuzhou the previous week. When he passed through Nanning, he had a meeting with Li Zongren, but it is not known what the result was. Then he took a steamboat from Nanning along the river via Hengzhou and arrived in Wuzhou on the 18th. At that time, Chen Zhangfu, the director of the Eighth Route Army's headquarters, had already closed the Wuzhou camp and waited to accompany Zhang back to Guangdong. He then took the Guanghua steamboat east from Wuzhou at 12:00 on the evening of the 18th and landed in Sanshui on the afternoon of the 19th and transferred to the Guangsan Road train to arrive at the station at 4:45 PM. Zhang came with only his wife and Chen Jinjie, the director of the political training department of the Fourth Army. He immediately took a car to Dongshan to visit Chen Jitang. According to people in that department, the First Route Army (i.e., the Gui Army) has indeed set up the First Route Army's headquarters in Wuzhou, presided over by Xia Wei, but the garrison headquarters has not yet been established, and the troops have not yet been urgently transferred. Furthermore, the entire military plan has not yet been decided. (May 20th)</p>

<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The Finance Department previously set up a business tax preparation office and formulated the business tax regulations, which were submitted to the Finance Department and forwarded to the Provincial Affairs Council for deliberation and decision. The tax regulations also included the firewood and rice industry as a trading industry subject to taxation. Recently, the citizens believe that firewood and rice are necessities of daily life. If a business tax is levied, merchants will inevitably pass the tax rate on to consumers, which will inevitably increase the price of firewood and rice and make it possible to assert that the livelihood of the common people will become more difficult. Therefore, the firewood and rice guilds have repeatedly received letters of inquiry from citizens and specially put forward a discussion to deal with it yesterday. It was decided to write a letter of opinion requesting the city chamber of commerce to forward it to the authorities to exempt the two industries from business tax in order to maintain the people's livelihood. The letter of reason is as follows: "For the sake of rice being like pearls and firewood being like cinnamon, and the people's livelihood being difficult, we jointly request that the authorities be requested to approve a clear order to exempt the business tax to alleviate the people's difficulties. Since Guangdong reversed the rebellion, wars have been continuous, and disasters of water, fire, and thieves have been rampant. Cantonese people have hardly been in deep waters and hot fires every day. Recently, the level of living has been increasing and the people's livelihood has been difficult. The prices of firewood and rice have soared. Firewood is only forty or fifty catties per yuan, and rice is only seven or eight catties per yuan. The common people have tasted the pain. Recently, I heard that the authorities have a measure to levy business tax, and the amount of capital, rent, and employees are the standards for taxation. The procedures are cumbersome. The industry has requested improvements, but there are no clear regulations for the collection of firewood and rice. It is thought that the authorities are considerate of the people's difficulties and anticipate that there will be an exemption. However, our association, etc., have to overthink, because recently the price of rice is like pearls and the price of firewood is like cinnamon, and the people's livelihood is increasingly declining. If the tax is levied according to the ordinary trading industry, the price will soar, and the desolate scene will be immediately visible. How can the people have a chance to live? (Explanation) Recently, firewood is forty or fifty catties per yuan, and rice is seven or eight catties per yuan. If the tax is levied according to the ordinary trading industry, the price will increase to at least five, which means firewood will be thirty catties per yuan and rice will be five or six catties per yuan. Thinking of this, I can't help but feel chills. Although it is said that the price is taken from the price of goods, the price of goods has already risen and the people's livelihood is difficult. Firewood and rice are necessities for the people's daily life, and are not comparable to other goods. I am sincerely afraid that the authorities will drain the pond to catch the fish, and the people will suffer miserably. This is why our association, etc., appeal to request a clear order to exempt the firewood and rice business tax in order to maintain the people's use and enrich the people's livelihood. It is hoped that Guangdong lacks food. Even if there is a bumper harvest every year, there is only food for four months. Recently, due to the soaring price of gold and the suspension of foreign rice transportation, the authorities also planned to allocate huge funds to relieve the poor in the midst of last year's emergency in the treasury. The slight amount of stamp duty was approved to be exempted. All these are to show concern for the people's livelihood and feel that there is no limit. However, as far as firewood is concerned, the source is interrupted from time to time because thieves are rampant and the rivers are blocked. Therefore, the Construction Department has measures to create agriculture and forestry to seek relief. Recalling the soaring price of firewood in Guangdong in the sixth and seventh years of the Republic of China, only 30 catties were sold per yuan. At that time, the three legal groups sent representatives to jointly visit the late Premier, who was instructed by telegram to order the Railway Bureau to reduce the fare and order the factories along the way not to detain the people. In the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, Tang, the director of the third branch of the Seafarers' Union, extracted a commission of two cents for every hundred loads of firewood. When the authorities found out, they executed Tang. All these things are nothing more than to show concern for the people's livelihood. Today's situation is easier and more severe than before. It is said that political tutelage and construction should be maintained with all efforts, especially since firewood and rice have been exempted from taxes and duties from the early Qing Dynasty to the present. In this autumn of people's suffering, how can we bear to engage in taxation? Our association, etc., pleads for the people's lives, thinks of problems and takes precautions, and dares to submit a statement to your association, requesting that the authorities approve a clear order to exempt the firewood and rice business tax in order to cultivate vitality and the future of the people's livelihood. It is deeply beneficial." (May 21st)</p>
<h3>Various Issues in the Sino-Japanese Railway Negotiations</h3>
<p>Regarding Loan Agreements and Interest Rates</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: After the Sino-Japanese railway negotiations designated special committees by both parties, the Japanese special committee has been fully prepared in Dalian and will come to Shenyang in the next few days together with Kimura. Our special committee is also gathering in Shenyang to discuss day by day the strategies to be taken. Gao Jiyi, chairman of the Transportation Committee, also plans to return to Shenyang in the next few days. This negotiation is extremely important. The Liaoning Provincial National Diplomacy Association has regularly convened an emergency meeting to discuss the policies that the people of the Eastern Provinces should take and to warn the special committees of the important responsibilities they bear, while at the same time giving sincere advice to the Japanese side. It is found that, in addition to the Chinese Eastern Railway, the Shenhai Railway in the Eastern Provinces is jointly operated by government and merchants. The Jichang, Jidun, Sitao, Taoang, Jihai, and Beining railways all have loan relationships with the Japanese side. Among them, the Beining Railway has relatively few loans, while the total of the principal, interest, and compound interest accumulated on the other railways will exceed 100 million yuan. The annual interest rate is mostly 9%. The Sitao Railway has relatively good business and can still meet the interest payments. The Jihai, Jidun, and Taoang railways will not have enough annual income even if all the interest payments are paid. Therefore, there is no question of the development of road services. All the railways have been burdened by the Japanese side's high-interest loans and are unable to cope with the unequal treaties on debt rights. Therefore, in this negotiation, our side should pay close attention to the revision of the loan agreements, the reduction of interest rates, and the responsibility of the Japanese side for the losses caused by the unequal treaties. In addition, the Taoang Railway was completed in the 14th year of the Republic of China by the South Manchuria Railway with a loan of more than 12 million Japanese yen. When the road was completed two years later, our side should only bear the 12 million Japanese yen for the construction, and there were no other loans. However, the Japanese side suddenly increased the fees for survey, supervisor's salaries, subsidies, travel expenses, and road construction campaign fees, and the total cost was called "various hanging fees" totaling more than 1 million Japanese yen, which must be recognized by our side. Our side argued that the road construction was a large package, and all expenses were within 12 million Japanese yen, and that the various hanging fees should not be established. The formal road agreement between the two sides has not been revised. The losses suffered by our side as a result of this amount to more than 5 or 6 million Japanese yen. The responsibility for this loss should also be borne by the Japanese side. The problem of the Taoang Railway loan has not been resolved for a long time because of this. It is difficult to avoid similar situations with other railways. Therefore, this Sino-Japanese railway negotiation is an important event. (22nd)</p>
<h3>Continued Levy of Provincial Border Tax at Shahu Pass</h3>
<p>People from All Walks of Life in Hequ County Telegraph to Request a Halt</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: After the National Government announced the implementation of tax reduction on New Year's Day, Shahu Pass in northern Shanxi also complied with the order. However, since most of the goods passing through that place enter and exit Mongolia, the provincial government formulated five temporary measures. All goods transported to or exported from Inner and Outer Mongolia are still temporarily collected as usual. Recently, the Tax Reduction Propaganda Committee of Hequ County telegraphed that Supervisor Yang of the pass had suddenly restored several temporary measures on his own, and the content encompassed everything and was still collected according to the old system without levying on everything, which was no different from restoring the provincial border tax. Therefore, it specially telegraphed to the provincial government, the provincial party headquarters, and the tax reduction propaganda committees of all walks of life in Shanxi to request a speedy halt to comply with the decrees and benefit business conditions. The telegraph read: "It has been found that the restoration of the Hehu Bureau violates the central government's good tax reduction policy and increases the exceptional suffering of the people. We have repeatedly appealed in writing and telegram, stating the reasons. Previously, we received Chairman Shang's respectful telegram promulgating five measures for the collection of taxes at Huguan, and we also sent a telegram explaining that the goods of Huguan and Inner Mongolia, which are not affiliated to the province, are taxed on their way to and from Shaanxi, Gansu, and Sui provinces, and that inland goods are not taxed. The people have followed the case. Unexpectedly, not long ago, Supervisor Yang of the pass unexpectedly posted a notice on Xiaori, restoring seven temporary measures that greatly contradict the five measures set by Chairman Shang's previous respectful telegram. The content encompasses everything, is difficult and heavy, and is still the restoration of the old system without levying on everything. In addition to sending the measures in detail by express mail, if the measures are implemented, it will be no different from restoring the provincial border tax. The people of Heshui swear to oppose it and will never recognize it. We sincerely request that you take pity on the people's difficulties and strictly stop it in order to comply with the original order and follow public opinion. With boundless gratitude, the Hequ County Tax Reduction Committee bows its head and prints the letter." (22nd)</p>
<p>Changsha Pass</p>
<h3>Investigation Underway in Embezzlement Case Involving Embankment Donations</h3>
<p>The Control Yuan also ordered the Hunan Provincial Government to thoroughly investigate.</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: The case of embezzlement involving embankment donations in Changsha Customs is currently under joint investigation by officials dispatched by the Ministry of Finance and the governments of Hunan and Hubei provinces. However, all former personnel of the customs office have privately left the province, and the suspects have fled together, making it impossible to access documents for review. The committee members have agreed to start by investigating the amounts of primary and secondary taxes received by the Tax Bureau and the number of pier donations in Hunan Province (because the suspect, during his tenure as supervisor under Mao, collected embankment donations at seven times the pier donation rate in Changsha, and Yuezhou Customs added 20% to the primary tax). This is to examine the amount of embankment donations that should have been remitted but were instead embezzled. It is reported that some progress has been made. Yesterday, the Hunan Provincial Government specially telegraphed the Hubei Provincial Government with the officially stipulated standards for collecting embankment donations to facilitate thorough investigation. The Hunan Provincial Government also received instructions from the Control Yuan to thoroughly investigate the case, report back with accurate details, and ensure that all suspects are apprehended and punished according to the law to uphold discipline. The telegram from the Hunan Provincial Government to the Hubei Provincial Government stated: "We have received your telegram inquiring whether the collection of embankment donations at Chang-Yue Customs should be based on ten times the pier donation rate in Changsha or continue to be based on the old customs rules, adding 20% to the primary tax. We request a reply via telegram so that we may comply." After investigation, pier donations and embankment donations are both local levies of the same nature. The procedures for collecting donations on goods are generally the same. The established pier donation rate is one-thousandth of the assessed commodity value, which is equivalent to 2% (i.e., two fen) per hundred taels of primary tax silver. The established embankment donation rate is one percent of the assessed commodity value, which is equivalent to 20% (i.e., two cheng) per hundred taels of primary tax silver. Therefore, the percentage of embankment donations collected is originally ten times higher than the percentage of pier donations collected. The intention of collecting embankment donations at ten times the pier donation rate is to maintain the original donation rate, not to change it. In the past, the personnel dispatched by the Chang-Yue Customs Supervision Office to collect donations arbitrarily exempted or refused to collect embankment donations for various imported goods, or used the excuse of collecting donations from Hankou, resulting in the nature of the embankment donations being the same as pier donations. The percentage of donations collected could not match the percentage of pier donations collected, which was a crucial point for seeking personal gain and engaging in corruption. The present provincial government, in view of this, clearly stipulated standards to rectify revenue and eliminate the malpractices of Hankou exemptions and non-collection. The situation has been reported to supervisor Liu Dejun and committee member Zhang Zexiong for transmission to your government. Since the rectification, not only the embankment donations</p>

<p>New Discoveries in Tuberculosis Treatment</p>
<h3>Translation from a German Magazine on Pulmonary Therapy</h3>
<h3>What is the Tuberculosis Bacterium?</h3>
<p>The tubercle bacillus (i.e., the tuberculosis bacterium) is a rod-shaped bacterium. Its body is straight or slightly curved, with a length of about one-five millionths of a meter. It is invisible to the naked eye. Prepared as a stained specimen using a skilled method, it can only be observed under a microscope at 600 to 1000 times magnification. It is indeed a very small object.</p>
<p>In ancient times, the Chinese called it "consumption cough worm." Nowadays, everyone knows that the tubercle bacillus is the "worm" of tuberculosis, not belonging to the animal kingdom. Countless lower microorganisms exist around us, commonly known as "minute organisms," invisible to the naked eye. These minute organisms are divided into two types: animal and plant. Those belonging to the animal type are called protozoa, and those belonging to the plant type are called fungi. These lower plant fungi belong to a branch of cryptogams, without chlorophyll. Fungi are further divided into three types based on their shape and properties: "filamentous fungi," "budding fungi," and "fission fungi."</p>
<h3>The Colonial Policy of Tuberculosis Bacteria</h3>
<p>The reproduction of fission fungi is based on their own division, that is, one becomes two, and two becomes four, gradually increasing. Therefore, they are called "fission fungi." Humans and other animals often develop diseases due to them, so they are called "pathogenic bacteria." Based on the different shapes, they are further divided into three types: "spherical fungi," "rod-shaped fungi," and "spiral fungi." The tuberculosis bacterium is a rod-shaped bacterium among the fission fungi.</p>
<p>The tuberculosis bacteria are most abundant in the sputum of tuberculosis patients, often increasing or decreasing depending on the severity of the patient's condition. According to Dr. Haikeler of Germany, a piece of sputum from a tuberculosis patient contains 300 million tubercle bacilli. Therefore, someone who coughs up sputum once an hour excretes 720 billion tubercle bacilli from the body and spreads them into the air every day and night. People in the world are attacked by them day and night. But where do these numerous bacteria come from? The fission fungi itself has a fission function, as mentioned earlier, and its increasing reproduction is the reason. In the beginning, it was originally a single fungus, which gradually divided, from one to two, and from two to four, and so on. The power of proliferation is gradually increasing. Now, let's assume that the speed of proliferation is that each hour performs a fission function, then within 24 hours, a single fungus has turned into 16 million. From this point of view, the following matters can be inferred:</p>
<p>(1) How vigorous the reproductive power of fungi is.</p>
<p>(2) Why do countless bacteria occur in the patient's body?</p>
<p>(3) Why does the patient's sputum contain countless tubercle bacilli?</p>
<h3>The Resistance of Tuberculosis Bacteria</h3>
<p>The resistance of tubercle bacilli is very strong. Knowing the magnitude of their resistance is most important for the prevention and treatment of tuberculosis. When the sputum of tuberculosis patients is placed in the air, the tubercle bacilli can survive for more than half a year. When placed in a dark room with a lack of light, they can still survive for more than a year. These fungi are particularly resistant to cold. They can withstand a cold of minus 10 degrees Celsius for six to seven weeks without dying. They are also more resistant to heat than other fungi. Other fungi die after two to three minutes at a temperature of 60 degrees Celsius, while these fungi require a temperature of 80 degrees Celsius for two to three minutes to die. However, their resistance to sunlight is weakest. They die after five to six minutes when exposed to direct sunlight. They die after one to two minutes at a temperature above 100 degrees Celsius. In terms of disinfectants, the tubercle bacilli of tuberculosis patients die after 30 seconds in 20 times carbolic acid solution, after one minute in 100 times carbolic acid solution, and after ten minutes in 1,000 times mercuric chloride solution.</p>

<h3>Deceration and Sterilization Method for Tuberculosis Bacteria</h3>
<p>The cause of pulmonary tuberculosis (i.e., consumption) is the tuberculosis bacterium. Once this bacterium enters the human body, it forms nodules at that site, blocking the blood flow. The tuberculosis bacterium can also secrete an acid-resistant wax to surround its body to defend against the invasion of all external drugs. Therefore, although various bactericidal drugs are taken internally or injected, they cannot reach the substance of the bacteria. The natural therapy, symptomatic therapy, physical therapy, serum therapy, drug therapy, and all other therapies that doctors have been accustomed to using in the past have not been completely successful, and the saying that there is no cure for tuberculosis has spread throughout the world because this profound theory is unknown. Therefore, modern tuberculosis scholars, based on the above theory, continue to research unremittingly, and as a result, this chemical holy agent that kills all tuberculosis bacteria, called Sanosin, has been successfully produced. This drug is invented according to the latest medical theory of Dr. Koch of Germany, the inventor of tuberculosis bacteria, and Dr. Berger of Germany, the inventor of deceration surgery of tuberculosis bacteria. According to the current practical reports of various tuberculosis sanatoriums in Germany, Switzerland, and other countries, this drug has the effect of penetrating the nodules of tuberculous lesions and dissolving wax, and it also has bactericidal power and can radically cure tuberculosis in stages 1, 2, and 3. It is indeed effective in all tests. The National Government's Central Sanitation Experiment Institute has verified the medicinal properties as peaceful and non-toxic, without any side effects. The medicinal effect is briefly described below:</p>
<p>(1) In the test tube experiment, when the medicinal power of "Sanosin" is used, the tubercle bacilli disappear after one minute, and their acid resistance is completely killed after three minutes without a single survivor.</p>
<p>(2) In animal experiments, it was found that "Sanosin" can penetrate into the tuberculous lesions. When examining the tubercle bacilli lurking in the lesions, they all lose their acid resistance. This is enough to prove that the wax has been completely dissolved.</p>
<p>(3) If the patient takes "Sanosin" internally for about a week, they will immediately see good conditions such as sputum dilution and body heat reduction.</p>
<p>(4) If you continue to take "Sanosin" internally for 30 to 60 days or more, you will see obvious weight gain, appetite stimulation, and all symptoms gradually alleviate, and finally achieve the great merit of bringing back to life.</p>

<h3>News in Brief</h3>
<p>Compared with pier donations, the amount of donations received each day has increased dramatically. Therefore, the Hunan Provincial Government telegraphed the fact that the embankment donations should be collected based on pier donations, and that there is no discrepancy between the original plan to add 20% to the primary tax according to the old customs rules. Please instruct your subordinates to comply accordingly.</p>
<p>The Control Yuan's instructions to the Provincial Government stated: "According to the signed report of Control Yuan members Gao Youtang, Tian Jiongjin, and Zou Hongji, the Hunan Provincial Party Affairs Steering Committee Wang Qi and Zhang Jiong telegraphed that corruption cases in Hunan Province have emerged one after another recently, especially the case of Yang Ren, the director of embankment collection in Changsha Customs, embezzling 200,000 yuan in donations, which was investigated and arrested by the Provincial Government. He was then handed over to Chen Ciyu, the deputy supervisor of the customs, for supervision. However, Chen and Yang were originally in collusion and embezzled another 35,000 yuan together and absconded. This is a disgrace to officialdom. We earnestly request that an order be issued to strictly arrest the suspects and punish them according to the law to uphold discipline." After review, it is believed that the case involves public officials embezzling donations and should be ordered to be thoroughly investigated and reported back by the Hunan Provincial Government for verification.

<h3>Bengbu Transportation Merchants Request Tax Reduction on Freight</h3>
<p>Passengers and goods switch to water transportation due to increased freight prices.</p>
<p>The salt, sugar, and paper industries are all affected.</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: Before the completion of the Jinpu Railway, the soybeans, wheat, and miscellaneous grains produced in eastern Henan and northern Anhui were mostly transported through the Changhuai waterway. When the Jinpu Railway was first completed, the freight rates were very low, so merchants all switched to transportation by train. Bengbu is located in the middle reaches of the Changhuai River and is the hub for disembarking and landing, so commerce has flourished in the past ten years, and the transportation industry also occupies an important position in Bengbu, with an estimated 70 to 80 companies. Although supply exceeds demand, each company can still operate stably. Since the National Government implemented the reduction of Likin taxes, all checkpoints in Anhui and Jiangsu provinces have been abolished, and the Changhuai River for thousands of miles is unobstructed. Grain and other goods from the upper reaches of the Changhuai River are transported by boat at low prices, so all boatmen and merchants have abandoned land transportation and switched to water transportation, which has greatly affected the business of transportation companies and grain merchants in Bengbu compared with before. As for the major imported goods such as silk, cloth, Beijing-Guangdong salt, ironware, sugar, and paper, which used to be transported from Pukou by train to Bengbu, now that the regular checkpoints have been abolished, all grain ships loaded with miscellaneous grains to Shanghai, Changzhou, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, and other ports immediately purchase the above-mentioned goods or go to Xiba to purchase salt and transport it back to northern Anhui for sale after unloading. Since all the grain ships go straight down to Bengbu without stopping, the commerce in Bengbu is extremely depressed, and the income of the Jinpu Railway Bureau has also decreased sharply. The Transportation Industry Association here believes that if no measures are taken to rescue them, the future of all industries will be unimaginable. At the beginning of the month, representatives Sun Qiqian and Wang Moqing were specially dispatched to the Jinpu Railway Bureau to request a reduction in freight rates between Bengbu and Pukou. The Railway Bureau only agreed to reduce them to 90%, but Sun and others hoped to reduce them to 70% to resist water transportation. After reporting back to Bengbu, the Transportation Industry Association joined forces with the Salt Industry Association, Grain Industry Association, Sugar and Paper Industry Association, and Ironware Industry Association to discuss rescue measures. It was decided to jointly send a letter to the Chamber of Commerce to forward it to the Ministry of Railways, calling for a reduction in freight rates or, with reference to the freight rates for sugar, cotton, and yarn on the Jinghu Railway, to set a special price for soybeans, wheat, and miscellaneous grains from Bengbu to Pukou in order to save land transportation business. It is reported that after receiving the letter, the Chamber of Commerce has not only sent a document to the Ministry to request a reduction in freight rates, but also sent a letter to the Jinpu Railway Administration requesting the same.

<h3>Mass Arrests of Thugs in Fujian Province</h3>
<p>Eleven members of the Xie Society were arrested and executed.</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Recently, the authorities of Fujian Province have learned that a group of unruly youths have secretly organized the Xie Society, gathering party members, carrying short guns and knives, and specializing in soliciting dry salaries from donation and tax agencies, as well as collecting customary fees from entertainment venues. They often commit assassinations and sabotage public order. Therefore, the security office, the garrison headquarters, the public security bureau, and other military and police agencies announced a temporary curfew from the 13th and carried out a massive search to arrest Cao Kai, Zheng Qingqi, Xie Zongying, Zhang Liansheng, Jiang Nuying, Zhang Qingguan, Chen Shengguan, Pan Yongchao, Deng Silu, Wang Mengquan, Kang Lin, and eleven other important members of the society. On the 16th, they were ordered by the Provincial Government to be escorted to the outside of the southwest gate for execution as a warning. From the 17th, military police detectives were dispatched to Jipi Lane, Cangxia Island, Cangqian Mountain, and Ya-Mu Island to search the agency department of the society and arrested Tang Pengxiang, Lin Yigao, He Huashu, Hong Ermei, and Lin Yunyi, five people were arrested and sent to the garrison headquarters for interrogation. On the 19th, the Provincial Government Committee held a meeting to thoroughly eliminate the thugs. At that time, three items were immediately discussed and decided: 1. A reward of 5,000 yuan was offered for the arrest of Lin Meisheng, the leader of the society. 2. Private possession of firearms by civilians was limited to submission to the garrison headquarters. 3. A limit of two weeks to investigate and clear the city's household registration. Residents must have joint protection to prevent criminals from hiding. There are no fewer than six to seven hundred members of the Xie Society, from dismissed employees and students expelled from schools to discharged soldiers and street ruffians. They are rampant in theaters and brothels on weekdays and stir up trouble when things happen. They have now disappeared to avoid arrest and flee. (May 21)</p>
<h3>Case of Private Sale of Qin and Han Bricks and Tiles</h3>
<p>The person who privately transported them was a Japanese named Ota.</p>
<p>The Shandong Education Department decided to send officials to confiscate them.</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The private sale of Qin and Han bricks and tiles collected by the Gao family in Weixian to the Japanese has been seized in Qingdao. Yesterday, the Jiaoji Railway Administration telegraphed the Education Department to report the situation, stating that seven wooden boxes were detained, including two steles and five boxes of Qin and Han bricks and tiles. The shipping documents listed them as jade and stone, and the consignee was Ota. Please send officials to Qingdao to discuss the matter. After receiving the telegram, the Education Department immediately telegraphed the Ministry of Education in Nanjing, intending to confiscate them in accordance with Article 6 of the Law on the Preservation of Antiquities, and sent Wu Jingshou to Qingdao with a letter to visit the Qingdao Municipal Government and the Jiaoji Railway authorities to assist in the confiscation and transport them to Jinan. The incoming and outgoing telegrams are recorded together below:</p>
<p>Jiaoji Railway Bureau's telegram to the Education Department: Jinan Station forwards to He Siyuan, Director of the Shandong Provincial Education Department: It is reported that seven wooden boxes were transported from Weixian Station to Qingdao on the 18th of this month. The shipping documents listed them as jade and stone, and the consignee was Ota. Upon inspection, they were found to be two steles and five boxes of Han bricks and Han tiles, which are indeed valuable items.

In addition to telegraphed the Ministry of Education and replying in a letter, Wu Jingshou, an official of the Department, has been appointed to visit with a letter in hand, hoping to look into and grant assistance in transporting them to Jinan for delivery to the Jinshi Preservation Institute attached to the Provincial Library for permanent preservation and research. This is to promote public friendship. Qingdao Municipal Government (The letter from the Department to the Jiaoji Railway Bureau is the same as the letter to the Qingdao Municipal Government, so it is omitted here).</p>
<h3>Stein Barred From Entering Xinjiang and Returns</h3>
<p>The Xinjiang Provincial Government ordered him to leave the country.</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: The Englishman Stein had previously entered Xinjiang and Gansu three times to investigate, taking away many Dunhuang Tang scriptures, Western Regions bamboo slips, Buddhist statues, and antiques. The academic community was deeply saddened by the loss of these valuable cultural relics. Last year, Stein, with the financial assistance of the British Museum and the American Yenching College, hoped to make a comeback and organized a large-scale expedition. He secretly departed from India, along the Pamir Mountains and Tianshan Mountains to enter Xinjiang and Gansu. In view of Stein's old tricks, various academic groups in our country repeatedly presented the National Government to revoke the passport of the group and telegraphed the Xinjiang Provincial Government to prevent him from entering the country. The Antiquities Preservation Committee received a reply telegram from Chairman Jin of the Xinjiang Provincial Government yesterday, stating that Stein has been stopped from returning to Kashgar and ordered to leave the country. He is scheduled to return to his country via Puli on May 18. (May 22)</p>
<p>The Anhui Provincial Government</p>
<h3>Two Construction Plans Under Review</h3>
<p>The Anhui Construction Department previously drafted the Anqing Municipal Construction Plan and the Anhui Recent Construction Plan and submitted them to the Provincial Government for approval. The Provincial Government has submitted them for review and excerpts the main points of the two plans as follows:</p>
<p>Anqing Municipal Construction Plan: (1) Reorganization of the city streets. The streets of Anqing are narrow and urgently need reorganization and measurement. The design is rough and should be carried out gradually. (2) Geographical conditions. The terrain of Area A is adjacent to the Yangtze River in the south, rising in the west and flat in the east. In the future, while reorganizing the old city streets, a new urban area will be opened in the east of the city. The water veins of Area B, 20 miles northwest of the city, have Shimen Lake, which can be used as a reservoir for tap water. In the west of the city, there is Ya'ertang and in the east, there is Linghu, which can be opened as parks. The temperature of Area C is at its coldest in early January, about 16 degrees Fahrenheit, and at its hottest in mid-July, about 100 degrees Fahrenheit. The maximum rainfall of Area D is 515 mm per day, and about 915.4 mm per year. The wind direction of Area E is mostly northeast and secondarily southwest. The population of Area F was 111,200 in the 17th year and 115,100 in the 19th year. (3) Regional division. The industrial zone should be located outside the west city, the commercial zone should be located on the riverbank and outside the east city's new urban area, the education zone should be located near Linghu, and the southern bank of Linghu should be designated as the administrative zone. Ya'ertang and Linghu are designated as parks, and other addresses are residential areas, small commercial areas, and small parks in the city. (4) Road planning.

<p>黑白敗於白隊二十八比二十四相差四分</p>
<p>The Black and White team lost to the White team by 28 to 24, a difference of four points:</p>
<p>今晚八時戰東西</p>
<p>Tonight at 8:00 PM, the East-West Game:</p>
<p>黑白隊來滬後一勝滬江再勝約翰其聲勢之煊嚇不可一世昨晚八時遇白　不幸以四分敗挫殊爲可惜比數二十八比二十四上半時所失過多下半時内雖突飛猛進死命緊追愈離愈近然時光催人仍得不償失焉黑白失敗之因不外下列數點黑白失敗原因</p>
<p>After the Black and White team came to Shanghai, they won against Hujiang and then against St. John's. Their momentum was unstoppable. Unfortunately, they lost to the White team by four points last night at 8:00 PM, which was a pity. The score was 28 to 24. They lost too much in the first half. Although they made rapid progress in the second half and tried to catch up, time was running out, and they still did not make up for the losses. The reasons for the Black and White team's failure are no more than the following: Reasons for Black and White team's failure:</p>
<p>（一）得球後不立即傳球運球太多錯過時機使敵人得從容佈防（二）前鋒進展遲緩不善鑽謀深入偷襲每在後方互傳旣耗時間復不試擲投籃（三）玩籃球時不應注重姿勢之美觀以炫耀觀衆博得無意識之呌好（四）比賽開始即當努力見敵人之攻勢兇猛又不盡力防守和衷共濟迨相差過多氣勢已衰即欲奮鬥爲時已晚</p>
<p>(1) After getting the ball, they did not pass it immediately, dribbling too much, missing opportunities and allowing the enemy to calmly deploy defenses. (2) The forwards were slow to advance, not good at planning deep sneak attacks, often passing the ball to each other in the back, which wasted time and did not attempt to shoot. (3) When playing basketball, one should not focus on the beauty of the posture to flaunt the audience and win unconscious applause. (4) One should work hard from the beginning of the game. Seeing that the enemy's offensive was fierce, they did not try their best to defend and cooperate sincerely. By the time the difference was too great and their momentum had weakened, it was too late to fight.</p>
<p>白隊藝術較佳</p>
<p>The White Team Had Better Art:</p>
<p>上塲之初旗鼓相當由各三而各五後此白隊漸入佳境回觀黑白常在後方盤旋毫不進取分數愈落愈後上半時白隊以十八對八領前下半時仍無起色直至最後五分鐘始見覺醒努力爭扎奈時不我與矣白隊楊毓麟得分最多孔廣益進攻退守滿塲飛奔錢鼎愼之投籃姿勢佳妙夏澤人接濟襲擊防不勝防其餘諸將俱見工夫極形聨絡黑白守多於攻投籃機會較少</p>
<p>At the beginning of the game, the two sides were evenly matched, each scoring three and then five points. After that, the White team gradually got into the swing of things. Looking back at the Black and White team, they often hovered in the back and did not make any progress, and the score fell further and further behind. In the first half, the White team led by 18 to 8. There was still no improvement in the second half until the last five minutes, when they began to wake up and struggle hard, but time was not on their side. Yang Yulin of the White team scored the most points. Kong Guangyi ran all over the court, attacking and defending. Qian Dingshen's shooting posture was excellent. Xia Zeren's support attacks were unstoppable. The rest of the players were very well-coordinated. The Black and White team defended more than they attacked and had fewer shooting opportunities.</p>

<p>Today, the Black and White team will play the East-West team in the Chinese Basketball Room. The time is still 8:00 PM. White Team:</p>

<p>Transactions reached 2.77 million.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Government Bond Market Situation</h3>
<p>In the spot market, except for the 1919 Customs bonds, there was no activity. In the futures market, bond prices fell sharply, causing extreme tension. The inflow and outflow of major bonds were heavy. With the situation not looking optimistic, market sentiment was uneasy. The Guangdong gang continued to sell large volumes on the market, causing bond prices to fall significantly. Trading opened lower in the morning, and the trend remained weak. Trading only resumed around 4 PM. In one transaction, the 1920 cigarette bonds immediately fell by 4 yuan and trading was suspended. Other issues also continued to fall by varying amounts of two or three yuan, while the 1896 bonds only fell by half a yuan. Spot transactions amounted to only 5,000 yuan. Futures transactions reached 1.77 million yuan in the morning and over 900,000 yuan in the afternoon, totaling 2.68 million yuan.</p>

<p>The Yarn and Cotton Yarn Market is Tight</p>
<p>The yarn market is trending stronger, with the situation consistent overseas. However, the price of silver has fallen sharply, rising in secret. Therefore, market sentiment has not weakened, and the current yarn market is showing signs of improvement. All gangs are showing excitement. The Guangdong gang, which is in a state of emergency, is also actively purchasing. Sichuan and the Northern gangs are showing strong interest. The Yangtze River area is also showing vitality. As a result, the market atmosphere is becoming stronger. Some sellers are short, and most short sellers have not yet acted. If the coarse yarn market continues to be active, there may be a price surge. Because sellers are putting too much pressure, a reversal will be difficult to contain when a good opportunity arises. However, most people still hold a bearish view due to the unfavorable political situation. Those receiving goods this month are very determined.</p>
<p>Man-Made Fiber Prices Rise</p>
<p>Although American cotton fell and the price of silver shrank in the previous market, sentiment was strong and prices rose by 4, 5, and 6 jiao for each month. In the afternoon, news of good actual sales caused the market to remain tight, and prices rose again by 3, 4, and 5 jiao for each month. Total transactions for the day were 35,700 bales. Sales included 1,750 bales from Gengfeng, 950 bales from Yongfeng, 850 bales from Yicheng, 850 bales from Dachang, and 800 bales from Taishengkang. Purchases included 1,800 bales from Tianlong, 2,800 bales from Yida, 1,100 bales from Yichang, 1,050 bales from Lichang, 1,050 bales from Dachang, and 800 bales from Jifeng. Closing prices are recorded below:</p>
<p>Man-Made Fiber Closing Price | Change | Account Balance | Man-Made Fiber Closing Price | Change | Account Balance</p>
<p>------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------</p>
<p>May 16.09 | Up 0.62 | 805,000 | August 16.15 | Up 0.08 | 862,000</p>
<p>June 16.17 | Up 0.08 | 652,500 | September 15.80 | Up 0.09 | 481,000</p>
<p>July 16.17 | Up 0.09 | 78,500 | October 15.49 | Up 0.11 | 394,000</p>
<p>Yarn Sales Progress</p>
<p>Yarn sales are improving. Statistics for the day show that various gangs purchased a total of 4,100 bales. Fellow merchants took in 405 bales. Prices rose by 5 jiao. Customer gangs took in 1,550 bales from Sichuan, 255 bales from Qinhuangdao, 300 bales from Shantou, 50 bales from the Northern gang, 110 bales from the mainland, 500 bales from Guangdong, 140 bales from Zhenjiang, 50 bales from Hankou, 350 bales from Changsha and Huai, 50 bales from Luzhou, 70 bales from Tianjin, and 300 bales from miscellaneous gangs.</p>
<p>The Cotton Market is Very Strong</p>
<p>The cotton market is very strong. Although foreign cotton prices have fallen and the price of silver has also fallen sharply, calculations still show that the price of silver is difficult to lower. Therefore, sentiment remains strong, and the volume of transactions this month is still large. Buyers are determined to receive goods, and there is talk of a short squeeze. The underlying reason is that the supply of goods is too low, and it is even more difficult to predict in the era of old goods.</p>
<p>Hankou Cotton Prices Rise by 3-5 Jiao</p>
<p>The market atmosphere was strong at the opening of the Hankou cotton market because of rumors of a large increase in gold prices. Therefore, sellers were scarce, and prices rose by 5 fen to 2 jiao for each month. In the afternoon, the current month rose by 5 jiao, and the long-term rose by 5 fen to 2 jiao. Transactions totaled 79,000 dan. Sales included 2,400 dan from Meiji and 2,300 dan from Gengfeng and 2,200 dan from Changji. Purchases included 4,400 dan from Changfeng, 2,900 dan from Shenchang, 2,200 dan from Taixing, 2,200 dan from Tianlong, and 1,700 dan from Gongtai. Closing prices are recorded below: Hankou Cotton Closing Price | Change | Account Balance | 7th Month 38.75 | Up 3.0 | 190,900 | 5th Month 38.80 | Up 0.55 | 68,900 | 8th Month 38.65 | Up 0.20 | 52,600 | 6th Month 38.80 | Up 0.35 | 139,600 | 10th Month 37.25 | Up 0.25 | 135,100</p>

<p>Current cotton transactions are still normal. The source is estimated at 500 bales of Yao cotton and 150 bales of Tong cotton.</p>
<p>Shaanxi Cotton 38.00, 200 pieces imported by Tongchang Factory. Spot goods delivered to the factory. Also 38.00, 100 pieces imported by fellow merchants. Sales and delivery of third-grade cotton yarn are still experiencing price declines.</p>

<p>English and Indian Cotton Industry Weekly News</p>
<p>Menghe: Although the market conditions last week fell along with American cotton, it was still relatively stable. Holders are also unwilling to sell at the current low prices. Merchants and speculators have sold 46,800 bales of White Luo Xi for delivery in April and May, 8,300 bales of Oumula for delivery in May, and 4,800 bales of Pingguoer for delivery in May. Most of them were taken in by exporters. Spot transactions were peaceful. Japanese merchants continued to purchase Pilar and Gandhi. There were not many inquiries from Europe because the European-Indian exchange rate was unfavorable. The weekly statistics are attached as follows (unit: 1,000 bales):</p>
<p>|             | 1930 | 1931 |</p>
<p>|---------------------|------|------|</p>
<p>| Cumulative receipts since September 1 | 321  | 2960 |</p>
<p>| Weekend inventory       | 1273 | 967  |</p>
<p>| Cumulative exports since September 1 | 1974 | 1929 |</p>
<p>| Exports to Europe        | 659  | 509  |</p>
<p>| Exports to China        | 320  | 291  |</p>
<p>| Exports to Japan        | 947  | 1109 |</p>
<p>| Other regions          | 48   | 20   |</p>
<p>Liverpool: Spot sales were very good last week, and prices fell slightly. Futures prices fell throughout the week. Weather news from American cotton did not affect this area. However, continued selling by the mainland gang and profit-taking by bulls caused the market to remain unstable. Egyptian cotton was stronger than American cotton due to good news from Alexandria.</p>
<p>Grain Merchants Sell Small Quantities, Foreign Rice Prices are High</p>
<p>Foreign rice futures did not open yesterday because the high price of gold made it uneconomical. Foreign firms were even more reluctant to sell, and the asking price for returned goods was raised by 1 qian. Importers felt the price was too high and did not import, so the overall market had no transactions. The customer rice market was still weak due to the influence of rice from the lower reaches of the river. It was difficult to find demand in this area, and prices continued to fall by small amounts. Jiangxi machine-milled late rice was offered at 250 bags for 11 yuan and 7 jiao and 2 fen. Also, 700 bags of machine-milled early rice were offered at 10 yuan, 7 jiao and 4 fen. 160 bags of Wuhu machine-milled rice were offered at 10 yuan, 7 jiao and a half. The customer rice yuan was purchased by the Guangdong gang for 300 bags of medium-grade goods at 13 yuan, 4 jiao and 3 fen. Because the supply was small and sales were active, the market was better than customer rice.</p>
<p>Wheat Flour Prices are Strong</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, prices for each month were quoted by foreign merchants, with small variations of 4, 5, and 6 jiao. Therefore, the market atmosphere was quite stable at first, with little change from the closing prices of the previous week. However, after the second session, a surge of activity suddenly emerged. The recent price increase was initially caused by prolonged rain. Unexpectedly, in recent days, foreign exchange rates have shrunk and gold prices have soared, making it impossible to order foreign flour and wheat (800 taels of gold left the customs in the morning). Therefore, both insiders and outsiders engaged in speculation with a surge of buying interest. The total volume in the third session reached over 900,000. When trading resumed in the afternoon, gold prices reached a high of around 805 taels, and insiders and outsiders were again motivated. Buyers seemed to believe that goods were scarce and increased prices even more aggressively. This month's prices were particularly strong due to active sales in the north. Judging from the situation, prices are still more likely to rise than fall. As a result, this month's prices rose by 4 fen and 2.5 li compared to the previous week, June's prices rose by 3 fen and a half, July's prices rose by 3 fen and 2.5 li, August and September's prices rose by 2 fen and a half, and October's prices rose by 2 fen and 2.5 li.</p>
<p>Long-Term Wheat Prices are Stronger</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the futures wheat market opened in the morning, prices for each month were quoted by foreign merchants, with small variations of 4, 5, and 6 jiao. People were calm about prices in the near term. Although the long-term prices did not move at first, outside short sellers were eager to cover their positions, so they were slightly better by 2 or 3 fen. When trade resumed in the afternoon, both sides were inactive this month due to the proximity of delivery, and prices were stable. The long-term prices were slightly lifted by the soaring gold prices and flour market. However, due to the good weather and the surprisingly rapid price increase in the previous week, the market was less volatile than the flour market. Therefore, people were calm and the price increase was small. As a result, this month's prices rose by 1 fen compared to the previous week, June's prices rose by 3 fen, July's prices rose by 4 fen, August's prices rose by 3 fen, and September and October's prices rose by 6 fen.</p>
<p>Northern and Southern Goods: Orchid Seeds are Out of Stock</p>
<p>Orchid seeds have been out of stock for more than a month. According to a letter from Xiamen, the inventory is exhausted. There may be a small amount of new flowers available in early next month, but they have been damaged by the continuous rain. Therefore, it is necessary to wait until the end of the seventh month of the lunar calendar for genuine water goods to be available from the border areas. It is expected that the output will not be large, and prices will be difficult to lower. The goods in stock here have long been sold out, and the available goods are also out of stock. The highest price has been sold for 55 taels.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea: European and American Silk Sales Remain Sluggish</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market in this port remained sluggish due to the lack of activity in overseas silk sales. Telegrams from Shanghai reported that European firms hoped to accumulate inventory at low prices. Chinese merchants found it difficult to sell. Yesterday, only Kechang took in ten packages of white silk, and Samsung took in six packages of yellow coarse silk. Prices were weak.</p>
<p>High-Quality Spring Cocoons from Gengshan Gate are Scarce and Prices are Rising</p>
<p>Continuous heavy rain has made cocoons scarce. The price of high-quality cocoons has opened at 56 yuan.</p>
<p>The spring cocoon harvest in Hangzhou this year has been surprisingly poor, with only about one-third of the usual output. Moreover, the cocoons are of poor quality. Only seven cocoon firms, including Weicheng, opened for business at Gengshan Gate. The market has been quiet for four or five days. Furthermore, the continuous heavy rain has made cocoons even scarcer, and cocoon prices are rising. Various firms are competing to buy high-quality cocoons, and the price has risen to 56 yuan. Secondary-quality cocoons are only 46 or 47 yuan.</p>
<p>The Once Extremely Prosperous Qihong Tea Market</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the tea market in this port, foreign firms such as Jardine Matheson continued to show strong interest in Qihong and other types of black tea. Firms such as Tianyu, Xiehe, Tongfu, and Dodd also actively searched for goods. Total transactions for the city reached over 4,600 boxes. The market was unusually strong, and prices were also quite stable. Observing the current market situation, the overall trend of black tea is stable. The green tea market was quiet yesterday. English firms still had a strong demand for Suian tea, but the supply was scarce and there were no large transactions. Chinese firms such as Zhenmei, Xiehe, and Tongfu also had some small transactions.</p>
<p>Large Quantities of Wubei New Tea Open for Sale</p>
<p>The output of tea in Wubei is the richest in the entire county. The abundance or lack of goods is closely related to the demand for green tea from foreign firms. The output in all four rural areas this year has been poor. According to a statement from a household in the Siyuan Mountain area, each village in that area usually produces over 2,000 dan of tea, but this year the loss has reached 600 dan. Therefore, it can be seen that the rest have also been severely reduced. Therefore, knowledgeable firms in the northern countryside, seeing that the supply of raw materials is insufficient and that the price of Tunxi tea is soaring, and that the supply of Deyu new tea is obstructed, are all eager to search for goods as soon as possible. Starting yesterday, they have successively dispatched firm clerks to buy tea day and night. Last night, from dusk to midnight, lights and scales could be seen everywhere along the roads in the villages. Tea merchants were buying tea with enthusiasm, which was rare. The towns of Qinghua and Sikou, where the tea market is concentrated, have already discussed and decided to open for business today (the 18th) at a fixed price of 48 yuan. Other places that have opened for business include Dacheng Mountain at 48 yuan, Xiaogang Houshan at 44 yuan, Xiyuan at 46 yuan, and Gaoan at 43 yuan. There are more than 20 other places where prices are being negotiated. It is expected that new tea from various villages will continue to open for business successively tomorrow.</p>
<p>News from the Xiushui Tea Market</p>
<p>According to a letter from a Xiushui firm, the quality of Xiushui black tea picked and produced by mountain households from mid-February was good, and the output was lower than in previous years. Initially, there were more than ten foreign and Chinese tea firms opening for business in the mountains. Later, because the Communist bandits in that area were severely defeated by the Central Army, the local area gradually became peaceful. Four or five new local firms have been temporarily added. Because there are fewer firms in the mountains, no one is competing for business, and the market is trending in one direction, unlike the chaos and disorder of the past. The amount of tea purchased by each firm ranges from 20,000 to 30,000 catties for large firms and over 10,000 catties for small firms. The price of first-grade tea is approximately 45 or 46 yuan. Because shops and firms are eagerly entering the mountains, the market price has not fallen. First-grade boxed tea has already been boxed and shipped to Xun and then to Shanghai. Several tea firms are still waiting to buy seed tea and make last-grade tea after the second-grade tea has been made because mountain prices are low.</p>
<p>Fine White Direct Tribute Cloths are in Short Supply</p>
<p>Recently, there has been a large demand for white direct tribute cloths. The five-liang variety is particularly popular. The stock in Shanghai is very scarce. Currently, only the "Good Times" brand is available, so the "Good Times" brand of white direct tribute cloths is suddenly in short supply. Its price has soared sharply. Yesterday, the spot price for immediate delivery was four liang and nine qian. Sellers were unwilling to open for credit sales at a net profit. Yesterday, Heji goods were sold for five liang and seven qian and a half, Mitsui goods for four liang and six qian and a half, Hong Kong goods for four liang and one qian, and striped goods for four liang and seven qian and five fen.</p>
<p>Demand for Yellow and Gray Wool Serge Remains</p>
<p>There is still demand for yellow and gray plain wool serge. Yesterday, tailors from this street and from cities such as the capital, Wuhu, and Hangzhou continued to purchase more. Taihe goods were four liang and three qian and a half, and Tianxiang goods were four liang, two qian and two and a half fen. Most transactions were for one or half a bolt, with no interest in whole boxes. This is because the weather is getting warmer, and transactions for wool and woolen goods are gradually becoming lighter.</p>
<p>Hardware: Dongbai Iron is Thriving</p>
<p>The Dongbai iron market has been thriving recently due to active sales in the Yangtze River area. Moreover, the Donghui exchange rate has soared, so prices have been rising. Customer gangs and hoarders have recently been competing to purchase goods, causing the market supply to become increasingly scarce. Therefore, standards are rising steadily. Currently, six-foot Dong iron is selling for one liang and seven fen per sheet, and seven-foot iron is selling for one liang and two qian and seven fen per sheet, an increase of two fen and a half compared to the previous market. Yesterday, there were three or four thousand sheets for sale. Two thousand pieces of English steel plate arrived yesterday.</p>
<p>200 tons of Heshi iron also arrived.</p>
<p>The market for four-foot and eight-foot English steel plates is very quiet because there are few buyers. However, yesterday it was reported that 2,000 sheets had arrived at the Xintai Ancient Pier, so there is no shortage of goods in the market for the time being, and there is no panic. The current market price is 2.5 li, estimated at 9 liang and 5 li, 6 liang and 9 qian and 7 li, 6 liang and 5 qian and 1 fen, 6 liang.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Qichang Pier received 200 tons of Heshi iron, so there is no concern about the supply being cut off in the market. The price is 33 liang and 7 qian and a half per box. It is reported that local factories sold 300 to 400 boxes yesterday, and export gangs such as Hankou, Tianjin, and Qingdao also made some purchases.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous News: 9,000 bags of wheat flour are being shipped to Tianjin, and another 7,600 bags are being shipped to Shantou.</p>

<p>Social News The Most Glorious Page of the SMS Emden - Lin</p>
<p>"Clear for Action"</p>
<p>My companions did not notice anything else until the lookout shouted that a ship was approaching us. Immediately, the order to "clear for action" was issued. Everyone thought that the approaching ship must be an old, dilapidated warship that we could easily dispose of. Earlier, we had received reports that the British cruiser HMS Sydney was escorting a convoy of merchant ships north of us, but a peculiar twist of fate caused this escort ship to abandon the shortest route and take a longer route to its destination, intending to avoid our detection on this route.</p>
<p>Later, HMS Sydney's mast and hull appeared above the horizon. We immediately weighed anchor, went to full speed, and sailed to meet her. We did not have time to allow the landing party to board the ship, but only sent a signal to inform them that something had gone wrong. They could not see the enemy at that time.</p>
<p>When the two sides were 9,000 meters apart, we opened fire on the enemy. The second salvo was very effective, and HMS Sydney soon began to run away. She hid behind a thick smoke screen, and at that time we thought we had scared her away.</p>
<p>But several hours later, HMS Sydney returned. She skillfully avoided our artillery fire and bombarded us. Soon, her bullets hit their mark. We had no reinforcements. The only hope to get HMS Sydney into our artillery fire was to lure her into circling around us. Our captain was successful several times, even causing HMS Sydney to enter the range of our torpedoes. At that time, we were already considering her as a prize. Colonel Weddigen, the torpedo officer, stood on the command bridge and issued the "prepare to engage" order to HMS Sydney.</p>
<p>The End is Near</p>
<p>The torpedo launchers were determined to release the lever, but in an instant, a shell from HMS Sydney struck the torpedo room, destroying it. Before long, water flooded the entire room. Now, the end was near, and we were preparing to perish, but the SMS Emden was still circling around in order to approach HMS Sydney, but the speed of progress gradually decreased, and the hull slowly began to sink. Every moment, water poured directly into the ship. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Youth Corner Random Notes on a Trip to the North - Anping</p>
<p>Fifteen: Fragments of Yanjing (Part 2)</p>
<p>In the previous two sections, I talked about the material aspects of Yanjing. Here, I want to talk about its spiritual aspects.</p>
<p>Is Yanjing University really good? Of course, it is a notch above the average universities in Jiangnan, but it is hard to say exactly how good it is. Of course, "good" here does not refer to its material aspects. It offers many courses, has ample funding, and the faculty is relatively good. These are all conditions that can make a good university. However, a certain kind of life can only cultivate a certain kind of atmosphere, and it is people who emerge from that kind of atmosphere. For example, the general level of students at Yanjing cannot be dismissed, but on the other hand, it cannot be said to be very good. In terms of "tools," the level of students at Yanjing is good. In terms of "knowledge," the level of students at Yanjing cannot be said to be bad, but in terms of "thought," the students at Yanjing do not have anything special to make us admire them. This is the most disappointing aspect. Students at Yanjing are almost all very diligent when it comes to studying, which is far beyond comparison with some universities in Jiangnan. No one does not study, no one is not diligent. Sitting in the library all day studying is not considered a big deal. Students will never praise each other for being "diligent." It is almost like diligence is something that students should do. You will be looked down upon by your classmates if you do not study, even if you are a top athlete. This is of course partly due to the good environment. To be honest, Beiping is a good place to study. Once you get there, you will be at peace and not have any evil thoughts. The school is also really far from the city, and the school often holds various legitimate entertainments. On the other hand, because the coursework is demanding, it cannot but make you study diligently all day long.</p>
<p>Many schools are centralized, for example, all the power of the school is in the hands of one or two people, such as the president or vice president. This kind of school is easy to go bad, but also easy to go well. Whether it goes well or badly depends entirely on the one or two people in power. But a school like Yanjing would not go that badly even if it was poorly managed, but it also could not be managed to that good a degree. All the power of the school is divided, each with its own limits, but also with its own connections. The way each department does things is really what Chinese people call "by the book" to the extreme. This is the advantage of their way of doing things, and they will never be like ordinary Chinese people who care about face. This is because Yanjing is a church school that has been completely influenced by the way foreigners do things. Everyone sticks to the rules, even the president himself does not dare to break them.</p>
<p>However, there is a phenomenon that is very funny, that is, although Yanjing is a church school, there are many teachers inside who have a particularly strong anti-Christian tinge. In class, they often complain and scold Christianity. However, the school does not care. Not only do the teachers have a very strong anti-Christian tinge, but even the students have an anti-Christian alliance that engages in various anti-propaganda activities.</p>
<p>Although Yanjing is economically abundant, they do not have an endowment. Their money is all donated from abroad from time to time. Their method of donating money is also very interesting. The money is donated by each department in its own name. For example, the money donated by the political science department, no other department should think about getting a dime of it. For example, if this money is donated to build a building, it can only be used to build a building and cannot be used for other purposes. Therefore, sometimes because too much money is donated and it cannot be used for other purposes, they have to think of many uses to spend these surplus donations.</p>
<p>In conclusion,</p>
<p>"It is very worthwhile to transfer from an ordinary school to Yanjing, but if you go to Yanjing with a beautiful dream in your heart, you may be disappointed."</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Twelve Bandits Executed by Firing Squad at Command Headquarters. Bai Jizhi, Battalion Commander of the First Battalion, and the First Squad of the Water Police successively apprehended twelve members of the Tai Bao A Shu gang, including Pei Jinlai (also known as Zhuang Adi), Jiao Busheng, Yu Alai, Zhu Danan, Song Aqiu, Xie Along, Zhang Amei, He Aqiu, Zhou Agen, Lu Heshang, Yao Axiao, and He Erheshang, all from Jinshan County. They confessed to the crimes of kidnapping in places like Lüxiang. Commander Cao sentenced them to death, and the pacification supervisor approved the sentence and ordered execution by firing squad. The execution was carried out at 1 PM on the 25th, with a team assigned to verify the identities of the bandits, bind them, and take them to the execution ground.</p>
<p>Investigating the Leak of Opium Raids. Fengjing is located at the junction of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. After Zhejiang Province strictly enforced the opium ban, opium dens and opium trafficking operations have moved to Songjiang, where business is thriving. Previously, the Jin County Magistrate cracked down on the opium tycoon known as the "Opium King", but because it was far from Songjiang, business continued as usual. Yesterday (24th), Yang Zuojun, the Inspector-General of the County Public Security Bureau, led police officers by car to Fengjing to conduct strict arrests. Upon arriving in Fengjing, it was discovered that all the opium dens and opium trafficking operations had been informed in advance and had shut down. Only Cheng Sijing, Lu Zhangshi, and Wu Arong were arrested, along with evidence. They were immediately escorted back to Songjiang for investigation into the leak. It was discovered at the long-distance telephone bureau that a police officer had called Fengjing to report the opium raid to Director Wang of the local Public Security Bureau, but his name was unknown. Subsequently, the police officers at the bureau were gathered to be identified by the telephone bureau staff. Li Yuanheng, an internal patrolman, was identified. After interrogation, he confessed that he had colluded with Ji Guangguo, the patrol chief of the dispatch office, and had agreed with a certain person from Fengjing to report the information for a reward of fifteen yuan. Director Shen ordered his detention for investigation.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Another Kidnapping Case in Hengjing. More than ten lake bandits suddenly came to the home of Xu Chunmei at 17 Xujia Bridge in Hengjing the night before last, kidnapping Chunmei's wife, Jin, and granddaughter, Yundi, and looting more than nine hundred yuan in cash.</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>The Public Security Bureau reported yesterday (25th) that it has ordered the relevant authorities to investigate and rescue.</p>
<p>Lake Bandits are Rampant Again. The county government reported yesterday (25th) that more than forty bandit ships, each with more than forty bandits, were discovered again in the central Taihu Lake near Hengjing. County Magistrate Huang summoned Du Hongyi, the captain of the police brigade, to discuss the strategy of suppression. Du left for the rural command post that afternoon to coordinate the suppression with the water police. Yu Ada, a former hostage who escaped from the bandit den, said that the group of lake bandits moved from the Baihu shore of Taihu Lake near Hengjing Port to Caogang at about 4 PM on the 22nd, heading south to Puyuan Town, where they robbed for three hours until the next morning. At 2 PM in the afternoon, they fled to Tanqiu, where they encountered the Zhejiang water police warship and opened fire for about half an hour. They then encountered the Suzhou water police's 15th team led by Inspector Zhang Bigao near Lintouba, who opened fire together with the security team until the morning of the 25th, when they kidnapped three hostages in Meiyan Liqiao, and so on. Yesterday, Shen, the director of the third district of the Suzhou Water Public Security Bureau, took the Zhizhong steamship towing six naval vessels himself, set off for Yanmu Shengze area to supervise the suppression.</p>
<p>Two People Acquitted in Liyang Grain Transport Corruption Case. The Liyang land tax corruption case involving Zheng Chengyuan and eleven others has not yet been heard by the High Court. At the time, seven people were detained in Suzhou. Pan Bin had died of emaciation. Among those detained in the case, Hu Jinghua and Shi Qinglian, former cadres of the Liyang Party Department, had their original four-month sentences expired as of yesterday (25th). Therefore, the two men withdrew their appeals and were acquitted by the High Court after investigation.</p>
<p>Scheduled Opening of Silkworm Cocoon Markets in Four Rural Areas. This county's silkworm cocoon season has been greatly reduced due to weather conditions. It is only 20-30% compared to previous years. Now that most silkworms have spun their cocoons, cocoon merchants are preparing to open cocoon markets. However, the number is only half that of last year. There are five companies in the urban area, such as Dexin and Hengchang, and more than ten companies in the rural area, such as Xiangshan Gong, Dayi, and Dada. The price will be announced on the 29th. Because the cocoons are not good this year, the price will be above 40 yuan. Regarding the business tax to be levied on the silk cocoon industry, cocoon merchants who have licenses are reluctant to oppose it, but they are taking a wait-and-see attitude. Wang, the director of the business tax bureau, has repeatedly stated and explained that it is difficult to implement. Yesterday, the bureau received a telegram from the Department of Finance stating that the issuance of licenses is to allow the establishment of cocoon markets and the drying of cocoons, which is different from cocoon merchants raising funds to collect, sell, and transport cocoons. The latter should be subject to business tax in accordance with the business tax regulations and should not seek exemption by citing the license. The telegram also instructed the Chamber of Commerce to check and not to ask for instructions again. It is also reported that the bureau has sent documents to the cocoon industry associations in Mudu, Xishan, and other places, ordering all cocoon markets to fill out application forms and apply for business licenses before the opening of the market, otherwise they will be treated as privately established and punished.</p>
<p>Local Tyrant in Dongtai Declared Not Guilty. Ting Duo, a resident of Dongtai County, was previously accused of being a local tyrant and gentry. The former Special Court sentenced him to seventeen years in prison. Meng refused to accept the sentence and appealed to the High Court, which changed the sentence to two years in prison. Meng still refused to accept the sentence and appealed to the Supreme Court, which sent it back for retrial. On the 25th, the retrial declared him not guilty.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Child Killed by Wuxi-Chengjiang Long-Distance Bus. Wuxi-Chengjiang Long-Distance Bus Company's No. 5 bus departed from Tonghui Road at 4 PM the day before yesterday, heading towards Yanqiao (the driver was Yu Baofeng, a craftsman in his 40s). While passing near Beizhakou, a 7-year-old boy named Wang Qinggen, the son of Wang Jisheng, a resident of the area, was playing in the road and failed to avoid the bus, which ran him over and killed him instantly. His flesh and blood were scattered, a gruesome sight. The driver, Yu Baofeng, seeing that he had caused the accident, intended to abandon the bus and escape, but was caught by passersby and sent to the First Police Station of the Sixth Public Security Bureau. At that time, Wang Qinggen's mother, Cao, also heard of her son's tragic death and immediately went out to see. Her grief at the sight of her son's body was heartbreaking. After Yu Baofeng was arrested, the patrol chief of the police station transferred him to the Sixth Public Security Bureau to prepare documents and send him to the General Bureau. Yesterday (25th), he was presented to the County Court to be interrogated and dealt with according to law.</p>
<p>Two Ships Robbed by Bandits in Baitangwei. The owner of a boat traveling from Wuxi to Jiangyin, You Xiuyi, was traveling from Wuxi to Longgubangkou in Baitangwei at about 10 PM the day before yesterday when he suddenly encountered several oar-propelled boats. More than ten bandits jumped out of the boats, holding pistols and ordering the boat to stop, and firing shots as a warning. The boat owner saw this and stopped the boat. The bandits then boarded the boat and robbed at will. As a result, two pieces of Shen Guangmao silk and satin and dozens of yuan in cash were looted, for a total loss of more than 130 yuan. At the same time, Fang Haifu, the owner of a boat traveling from this county to Jintong Bridge, was also passing through the area when he was stopped by bandits. The bandits forced the two boats to come closer and then boarded the boat and searched the passengers one by one. After more than two hours, they took the stolen goods, jumped back onto their original boat, and sped away. After investigation, it was found that passengers had been robbed of silver dollars, clothes, copper coins, and other items, for a total loss of more than 300 yuan.</p>
<p>Negotiations Over Steamer Collapsing Embankment. A small steamer of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company traveling from Gongyunqiao to Qianzhou Town in the 15th district collapsed part of the embankment near Qinxiang Town the day before yesterday, but did not repair it. The villagers rose up in protest. Yesterday, the small steamer was traveling from the countryside to the city when it passed under the Qinxiang Bridge. More than one hundred villagers gathered under the bridge and threw yellow stones, injuring boatman A-Quan. The boat crew arrested Qin Dingxun and brought him to the city and sent him to the Second Public Security Bureau, who transferred him to the County Public Security Bureau for interrogation. However, the villagers are also negotiating with the Shipping Bureau on reasonable grounds, and it is unknown how it will be resolved in the future.</p>
<p>Lake Bandits Rob in Majishan. The lake bandits who recently robbed the Fengshuidun area bordering the three counties of Wuxi, Wu, and Yi have their main base in Majishan in Taihu Lake. According to the villagers there, the bandits are divided into three groups, occupying the northwest, south, and central parts of the mountain. They come down the mountain to chat with the villagers, but in reality, they are inquiring about the residents' property. After 10 PM the night before last, several bandits suddenly came to the home of Song Zhutang, the village chief of Yanmen Township in the western part of the mountain. Because the gate was strong, they climbed over the wall and broke the windows to enter the house and search for loot. Fortunately, the family had already heard the noise and fled to a neighbor's house. The bandits searched for a long time before leaving with the loot and signaling to their team to return to the southwest. The loss was about several hundred yuan.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Continuous Robberies and Injuries in Shiqiao Town. Dozens of bandits suddenly came to Shiqiao Town in the third district of Wu County on the night of the 23rd, each armed with guns, and robbed the homes of Dan Shujin, Dan Yantong, Zhang Shunkang, and Dan Bodu, for a total loss of several thousand yuan in cash and clothing. He Jinghe and Dan Weibing were shot and injured, and He's life is in danger. The bandits had already escaped when the nearby Public Security Bureau sent police to the scene. On the 24th, the Public Security Bureau reported the incident to the General Bureau and the County Government and requested an investigation.</p>
<p>Robbers Hold Up Pedestrians. At about 12 PM on the night of the 23rd, a night car passenger named Yu Kang (working at the Nantong Court) was traveling by rickshaw under the Diaojiao Bridge outside Zhongshan Gate in Wu County when he was suddenly robbed by two bandits who searched him and took his wallet, cash, and certificate. After reporting to the Public Security Bureau, Director Li ordered Lu Hanjun, the patrol officer of the responsible substation, to solve the case within three days.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Four Families Robbed in Xiangqiao Town in One Night. At about 11 PM on the night of the 22nd of this month, more than twenty bandits, all armed with pistols, came by double-oar fast boat from the junction of Chang and Tai in the eastern part of the Zhengxiu District's Xiangqiao Town. When they arrived at the town, they first fired their guns as a warning and cut off the telephone line installed in the Jiangcheng Dahai Foreign Goods Store. Then, they went to the entrance of the Jiangcheng Da Shop, broke the door with a huge stone, and rushed in to loot. After the looting, they went to the Jin Fusheng Flower Shop and the Pan surname hotel to rob. The bandits did not leave to Nantai until 12 PM. When passing through Yaozhen, they broke into Cui Shusheng's house and ransacked the boxes and chests, searching for valuables and clothes. After investigation, it was found that Jiangcheng Dahai Foreign Goods Store had been robbed of wool, green grass, wool serge, tribute cloth, and cash, totaling about more than one thousand yuan. Jin Fusheng had been robbed of some winter leather clothing, etc.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Oppose the Establishment of a Wounded Soldiers Factory. The 11th Division of Hankou established a wounded soldiers factory in Tong, and the first batch of eighty-four wounded soldiers arrived. All sectors of society are unanimously opposed because the representatives who went to Beijing to petition are still in progress. On the evening of the 23rd, the entire city's business community went on strike. At 12 PM, the Chamber of Commerce convened a joint meeting of various industries to persuade them to stop, but it was ineffective. At 4 PM on the 24th, the Chamber of Commerce held an emergency meeting and resolved five items: (1) To send representatives to the County Party Department and the County Government to request them to be responsible for negotiating with Zhuang Mingyuan, the director of the wounded soldiers factory, to relocate the factory. (2) To telegram the General Headquarters to order the wounded soldiers to leave Tong. (3) To separately telegram the Ministry of Military Affairs and the Provincial Government, and to urge the petitioning representatives in Beijing to strive for it. (4) To join the All-Circles Citizens' Congress. (5) To resume business in unison with all sectors before the Citizens' Congress is held. The County Government immediately telegraphed the Provincial Government and the Civil Affairs Department, stating that the 11th Division of the Army used privately owned poor people's factories to learn skills and had not consulted with the local representatives in Beijing. The crowd was agitated when they arrived in Tong on the 23rd, and the business community went on strike. The County Magistrate advised them to open the market, and the people gathered at the government to demand that the wounded soldiers leave Tong. He asked the General Commander Chen to transfer them to other places to quell the public anger and wait for instructions. Zhuang, the director of the wounded soldiers factory, said that the local opposition was very strong, so he telegraphed the General Headquarters and Luo Shizhang Zhuoying in Hankou for instructions, and telegraphed to stop the departure of the second batch of wounded soldiers.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Tax Collection Agent Accused of Corruption. The distilleries in the 90th district of the northwest township of the county allege that Wang Shaoqing, the wine tax collection agent of the two districts, has engaged in corrupt and oppressive practices. In addition to formally submitting a written complaint, they have appointed Yang Youba, Wu Zuoqi, Wu Xianting, Wu Zuochen, Ganquanshan, Zhao Wanliang, Tiepaidian, Li Mengjia (Director of the Farmers' Association of the Ninth District), and Guding Temple Li Xiaozhou (Director of the Farmers' Association of the Tenth District) as representatives. They are scheduled to come to Yangzhou on the 25th to go to the County Government and the Party Department to state the agent's corrupt practices and request a definite tax collection method to avoid numerous names and corrupt disturbances.</p>
<h3>Luhe</h3>
<p>Total Resignation of Teachers and Staff from All Schools. Last year, teachers and staff from all schools launched a strike due to overdue salaries, which has been reported in various newspapers. This year, salary arrears have accumulated to more than three months. Yesterday (21st), the teachers and staff held a meeting and sent representatives to the Education Bureau to negotiate, but to no avail. The teachers believed that under the circumstances, they had no hope of supporting themselves and their families, and had no choice but to resign en masse. Therefore, all teachers submitted letters of resignation to their respective schools to show their determination. Currently, the principals of all schools are seriously negotiating with the Education Bureau. If there is no adequate solution, they also intend to resign and find other jobs. It is unknown how this teachers' strike will be resolved.</p>
<h3>Huzhou</h3>
<p>Hucun Robbed by Bandits. Hucun, located at the junction of Dongtang Dongqian in the eastern township of this city and Nanxun, has more than thirty small stores and more than one hundred households. At about 1 AM the day before yesterday (21st), two bandit boats suddenly arrived, with more than thirty bandits armed with guns. After landing, they carried out large-scale looting in the village, robbing more than twenty stores and residents, with losses of more than 2,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Security Team Captures Five Bandits. The Ninth Company of the Second Regiment of the Security Team learned that the bandits who robbed the firearms of the Lijiaxiang Security Group were hiding in Lijiacun, Xiaowushan. The company sent more than ten plainclothes soldiers to arrest them. However, more than ten bandits opened fire to resist arrest. The two sides exchanged fire for about half an hour, wounding two bandits, Liu Qi and Wu Dehe, and capturing the bandit leaders Zheng Laosan, Zheng Laosi, and Ruan Xingtian. Two wooden-shell guns and four fast guns were confiscated. The soldiers of the company sent the captured bandits and firearms to the Changxing County Qingxiang Bureau for verification.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Peddler Robbed and Cut Seven Times. Chen Amao, a native of Xiaoshan, set up a small stall selling cigarettes and fruit at the Baoan Liangting in Hushu Yuhangtang. Unexpectedly, three robbers came the night before last, knocked on the door, and entered the house under the pretext of asking for straw. After entering the house, they intimidated him and ordered him to hand over his silver dollars. Chen replied that he had no money, which angered the robbers. They pulled out their knives and cut Chen seven times, and robbed Chen of two yuan and seven jiao in silver dollars. Chen is seriously injured and his life is in danger.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing</h3>
<p>Robbery and Murder Case Occurs in Baiyang. Zhang Zhiqing, who is from Shaoxing Baiyang Dangshan, has been the manager of a bank in Tianjin for a long time and is wealthy, which has attracted the attention of bandits. On the night of the 23rd, dozens of bandits suddenly came and used force and weapons to break into the house, ransacking boxes and chests, and searching separately. Zhu Atang, a servant in the house, shouted for help and was stabbed to death by the bandits. They also stabbed and injured three other people before leaving with their loot.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>The Public Opposes Increasing the Household Registration Fee. This time, the Xiaoshan County Government was ordered to handle the Qingxiang and began investigating household registrations and inspecting civilian firearms. According to provincial orders, each household was issued a household registration certificate and charged a fee of one jiao, and each gun inspected was charged a fee of two jiao. This was stipulated by the provincial order. Unexpectedly, the First District Office of the urban area proposed to increase the fee for each household registration certificate by five fen, intending to charge one jiao and five fen. However, the public was dissatisfied with the increased burden on each household. The provincial order stipulates that the fee for household registration certificates is uniform throughout the province, but Xiaoshan District suddenly increased it, ignoring the people's difficulties and exploiting the people's wealth. This kind of discussion is too harsh. They have already telegraphed the province to revoke it. It is unknown how the provincial peak will approve it.</p>
<p>Rare Disaster of Gale and Hail. In the villages of Tongxing Zhenfu, etc., in the seventh district of Xiaoshan, on the night of the 21st, there was a sudden thunderstorm, followed by gale, hail, and torrential rain. All the thatched houses in the villages were blown down. Many farmers in the villages were in the process of putting silkworm cocoons on clusters, and more than twenty houses were burned by the silkworm mountain fire due to the collapse of the houses. Nine-year-old girl, surnamed Qiu, and three others were injured, and hundreds were injured. The flowers, wheat, soybeans, etc. on the ground were all crushed by the hail. The total loss amounted to 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. This is truly a rare disaster that has not been seen in decades.</p>

<p>Border Dispute Expected to be Resolved. The border dispute between Anhui, Zhejiang, Chang, and Ji has been entangled for a long time. The Ministry of Internal Affairs is now proposing a compromise solution in accordance with the border survey regulations, under which the entire Shangtang Village will be assigned to Zhejiang Chang and the entire Jingzhou Village will be assigned to Anhui Ji. The private property of the people will not be affected. It can be implemented after it is submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval.</p>
<p>Department of Finance Notifies County Magistrates Owning Arrears. There are more than seventy cases in Anhui Province where county magistrates who have arrears and have not handed over their accounts have been wanted and their property has been sealed. The Department of Finance is now notifying that those who go to the county to clear up their accounts before the end of June will be able to cancel the wanted status and return their property.</p>
<p>Educational Circles Fight for Education Funds. The Anhui fiscal year 20 education budget increased by more than 570,000 yuan compared to the tenth fiscal year. The provincial government did not immediately approve it, and representatives from the education sector are fighting for it. Liu Fu, the head of the provincial government, has telegraphed Chen Diaoyuan, the chairman in Shanghai, to ask for instructions. It is feared that it will still be difficult to pass the proposal as it stands.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>June 1, Suzhou</h3>
<h3>Provincial Schools Adjourn Early</h3>
<p>Due to Lack of Funds</p>
<p>Enrollment Will Be Suspended This Summer</p>
<p>The principals, teachers, and staff of Jiangsu provincial secondary schools have previously held meetings and decided that if the April funding could not be fully paid by the end of May, the teachers and staff of each school would stop working from June 1, the schools would adjourn early, and they would repeatedly appeal to the responsible parties, hoping to urge the authorities to realize the severity of the situation and take measures to provide relief as soon as possible. Unexpectedly, it is now the end of May, and the actual funding paid is still one and a half months short of the minimum amount desired by the schools. The authorities are too unsupportive and disregard the precarious education situation in the province. Because they have no rice to cook, they cannot maintain it and are preparing to end it. It is decided that all will adjourn early on June 1. It is heard that the principals of each school are planning to hold a meeting in Nanjing on the 29th of this month to discuss various issues after the adjournment. If the authorities do not take measures to provide relief, each school may suspend enrollment this summer.</p>
<h3>Letter to Director Niu of the Education Funding Office</h3>
<p>The Teachers and Staff Union sent a letter to Director Niu of the Education Funding Office, stating that on this day, they paid respects to Chongjie and expressed their heartfelt feelings. They were disappointed that he had returned to Shanghai. The funding for Jiangsu provincial schools has been exploited and plundered by various parties, and the annual amount is still the same as it was ten years ago. Supply and demand are not corresponding, and the situation is getting worse. Arrears are accumulating month after month, and only half a month's payment is made at a time. It is also heard that there will be no funding for recurring expenses after April, and temporary expenses are even more unimaginable. The schools in Jiangsu Province are culturally advanced, and it is now a time of political training. The phenomenon is regrettable. The principals of each school cannot endure the economic pressure that hinders their loyalty to the Party and the country, and have decided to adjourn early on June 1. After the teachers and staff of the province have worked hard and pondered, they are suffering from the cries of children and wives. Their pain from enduring oppression is even greater than that of the principals. There is no profession where workers are supervised and not paid. The colleagues in Jiangsu Province feel that they are not even as good as mediocre workers. Colleagues feel that unless they work hard to save themselves, turn back the hearts of those who exploit, and change the minds of those who plunder, there is no way to arouse the attention of people in society and win fair and correct criticism. In addition to submitting a letter expressing a consistent and decisive attitude to Director Liu for submission, they are specially sharing their innermost thoughts. Please have pity and save them. If the education history of Jiangsu Province must leave a stain, colleagues are unwilling to do so. Sincerely yours, the petition representatives of the Jiangsu Provincial Secondary School Teachers and Staff Union, Wu Dezhang, Xia Peibai, Gu Kangbo, Xue Jianwu, Wang Dagang, Chen Yue, Fu Qianzhi, and others.</p>
<h3>Forty Elementary Schools Added in Beijing</h3>

<p>Shanghai Municipal Council</p>
<h3>Subsidize Private School Funding</h3>
<p>Director Xu of the Municipal Education Bureau Releases Statement</p>
<p>Serious Action Will Be Taken if Accepted Directly</p>
<p>This reporter made a special visit to Director Xu of the Municipal Education Bureau regarding the important matter of the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council's decision to subsidize private schools in the Concession with more than 70,000 taels of silver. Here is a record of his statement:</p>
<p>The Municipal Council has no right to administer education in the Concession. The curriculum and moral education of the four Chinese Public Schools and Sanmin Elementary Schools that it has established do not comply with the central educational principles and standards, and it is painful to see the Concession as a place outside the law. The Bureau is currently planning to take back the management rights of the Chinese Public Schools, etc. The Municipal Council has recently been attacked by citizens and has had to cover up its actions by subsidizing private schools. On the one hand, it hopes to win the favor of the public with a small amount of money, and on the other hand, it takes advantage of the name of subsidies to steal the right to manage private schools. Its plan is truly clever and dangerous. Moreover, it is heard that those who want to be subsidized are not only within the scope of the Concession but also in the area of the road outside the border, so its infringement of our country's sovereignty is even worse. In short, the Municipal Council has an income of 1.61 million taels per year, but only more than 300,000 taels are used for Chinese education, which is far less than the 1.06 million yuan spent by the Municipal Government with an income of 6.5 million yuan. The Bureau believes that the Municipal Council really needs to expand its funding for Chinese education as much as possible, but the right to allocate funds should belong to the only educational administrative agency in this city, namely this Bureau. Therefore, if any private school directly accepts subsidies from the Municipal Council before the Municipal Council has consulted with this Bureau, strict action will be taken.</p>

<h3>Test Senior High School and Junior High School Students' Understanding of Party Principles</h3>
<p>The Time is Around Mid-Next Month</p>
<p>In order to assess the understanding of Party principles of senior high school and junior high school students in the city, the Training Department of the Municipal Party Department is preparing to promote the method of examination in accordance with the Department's work. The target of the examination is the senior high school and junior high school students in the city. However, since there are many schools, the administrative authorities of the Municipal Education Bureau are afraid that it will be difficult to hold the graduate examinations this year. Therefore, a total of 47 municipal and registered private middle schools in the city have been selected as the target of the examination (all senior high school and junior high school students (i.e., graduates of the third grade) are the target to examine the Party principles of the graduating classes of middle schools in the city. It is heard that the examination materials are taken from the Party principle textbooks of various bookstores in the city, with reference to other important materials, and are compiled by a mixed method. The performance is being actively tabulated and allocated in accordance with the law. The meaning of mixed examination includes two functions: 1. Collect all Party principle materials; 2. Senior high schools and junior high schools can use them, so that the purpose and technology of the examination can be taken care of when it is implemented. It is also a good plan for the city to implement Party principle education. The Department's Party principle education section has prepared various regulations and the examination schedule of each school, and will issue a letter to the Municipal Education Bureau to inform all schools, and it is heard that the examination will start in mid-next month.</p>
