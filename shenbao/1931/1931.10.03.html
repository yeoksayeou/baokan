<p>抗日救國運動中敎育界之責任　　自日本暴行發生以來。我舉國學生青年。椎心泣血。悲憤萬狀。有投筆從軍者。有囓指血書者。更有憤恨自殺以促國人之覺醒者。奔走呼號。血涙交流。一種愛國家愛民族之熱忱。可歌可泣。中華民族之一綫生機。應其在是。中國尙有此民氣。有此青年。吾人敢斷言中國必不至滅亡。中國前途。尙充滿有無限之希望。　　雖然。流涙流血。嘶聲呼籲。終屬可暫而不可常。青年血氣未定。情感起落無常。驟然之剌激。可使其血脈騰沸。事過境遷。其情緒亦極易降落。五四運動時代之朝氣。而今安在。濟南慘案時代之朝氣。今又安在。今日内憂外患。交相煎迫。不斷國脈。僅存一綫。如國民再不作最後之覺醒。終始之努力。如不能常持其朝氣。日即於新之路程。則古老破落之民族。决無倖存之理。故處此一髮千鈞之時機。如何誘掖青年步入奮鬥之正軌。如何指導青年之奮鬥應急而有效。如何保持青年之朝氣。助長其創造新時代之能力。如何堅定其意志使其情感不至漲落無常。斯爲我全國敎育家在今日抗日救國運動中所應負荷之重責。　　吾人認爲目前之中國。已入於非常時代。敎育界本身應有非常之認識。敎育本身亦應有非常之敎育。　　非常之認識與非常之敎育爲何。吾人以爲。　　第一。敎育家本身應認清本國。認清日本。並認清世界。當前欲滅我民族者爲日本。但日本何以侵我。我何以被日侵。世界列國何以不出而干涉。進一步言。日本侵我之意義何在。日軍暴行於遠東與世界將發生若何影響。設使我東北遂長此落入日人之手。世界局勢又將起若何變化。我國將陷入若何地位。部應有相當之認識與把握。惟知彼知己者乃能决勝負。惟内審國情外嘵世界者乃能謀對策。故欲抗日救國。必先自知必。先知日。亦必先知世界。此全國敎育界在今日應有之認識一。　　第二。應認識學生。學生未受舊社會之薰陶。其思想與行動。都爲純潔的。活潑的。前進的。敎育界應認識此點。應時時與學生親密接觸。與學生打成一片。應時時以自身生活之經騐。供學生之體認。更時時以學生之朝氣。防自身之衰頽萬不應岸然道貎故自矜持。上課爲師生。出門成路人。學生與敎員有若不處於同一時代。無形中劃成新舊分野之鴻溝。惟認識學生乃能把握民族之將來。惟親近學生。乃能使學生之行動趨於積極而有效。亦惟有與學生打成一片。乃能使敎育之效率增多。此全國敎育界在今日所應有之認識二。　　第三。應認識敎育之使命。敎育之使命。在於推進社會。推進時代。使社會日即於合理之軌道。使人羣日步近幸福之樂園。青年學生即爲推進社會之動力。即爲創造時代之先鋒。如何使用此動力。如何領導此先鋒。即爲敎育界之責任。故敎育界絶不應有傳統觀念。不應因循守舊。不應固守成軌。應領導學生日趨於維新之途。此全國敎育界在今日所應認識者三。　　國處今日。勢如纍卵。舉國上下。從今日起。如再不以毫無疑慮之態度。領導朝氣勃勃之青年。作維新有效之奮鬥。而猶畏首畏尾。固守舊軌。因循徘徊。則民族前途。决無可救。上述三者。我舉國上下。蓋都應有此認識。　　次之。在此非常時期。自應有非常時期之課程。非常時期之課程爲何。吾人認爲應删除一切不切實際不切需要之課程。即最經濟之時日與辦法。敎授應急之救國科目。所謂應急之救國科目。初不僅限於男學軍事。女習看護。於此之外。吾人認爲更應注意於（一）增進經濟戰爭之生產力。（二）增進和内。禦外之團結力。（三）增進判斷事態之思想力。（四）增進經濟戰爭之生產力。（五）增進抗禦强暴之抵抗力。一言以蔽之。即應於此非常時機之下。敎育學生青年。使其身體健全。思想健全。行動健全。堅定意志。持久奮鬥。若敵騎薄城。山河破碎。而猶如平時之敎其所敎學其所學。如僅以爲男學軍事。女習看護。即可以抗强。即可以救國。前者爲迂闊。後者爲識淺。其實皆非。吾人茲謹貢其管見如此。時危勢急。敎育界其急起肩荷其應負之重任。國内要電三京平航空定期搭客　　（北平）　京平航空定十六日正式搭載乘客、（二日專電）羅文幹由粤北返　　（北平）　羅文幹二十九由粤北返、不日可抵平覆命、（二日專電）張宗昌母抵平　　（北平）　張宗昌母今由大連抵平、寓利通飯店、副官梁瑾玉隨來、張母向人表示、效坤絶不能作亡國奴、我也不能呌他做辱國之事、彼日内來平、倘有賣國行爲、我即自殺、（二日專電）德新使陶德曼抵平　　（北平）　德新使陶德曼昨午夜由瀋抵平、一二日内晉京、（二日專電）華北黨部聯陳三事　　（北平）　冀平津熱綏五省市及北寗·平綏兩路特黨部、聯絡電中央、痛陳三事、（一）鞏固中央、（二）團結同志、（三）眞正統一、（二日專電）唐山北戴河日僑到津　　（天津）　唐山北戴河日僑五十餘名、經我國軍警保護、昨今平安抵津、（二日專電）津自來水公司工潮　　（天津）　自來水公司董事會因工會理事馬純黎、進行反日工作、經日董事要求開革、工會大憤、醖釀罷工、形勢嚴重、二日經市府社會局·市黨部、派員向公司交涉、董事會允令馬即日復工衆怒始平、（二、日專電）青市實業銀行擠兌　　（青島）　本市實業銀行二日午後二時、忽發生擠兌、因謡傳濟行擠兌所致、該行特延長辦公時間至晩十時、據調查、該行準備金充足、不致影響、（二日專電）滬急振欵携湘散放　　（長沙）　滬急振欵十萬八千、由趙友琴携湘散振、濱湖各縣救災會再推魏振邦赴京滬請振、（二日專電）軍部派員視察澄砲臺　　（江陰）　軍政部王廳長朱科員偕洋顧問二日蒞澄、視察黄山砲臺、（二日專電）南菁學生驅敎務長　　（江陰）　南菁學生二日晨將敎務長薛德炯驅出、敎職員星散、即行停課、學生家長開緊急會議、電請敎廳整飭學風、（二日專電）張礪生過徐赴歸德　　（徐州）　騎師長張礪生二日晨乘平浦車由京來徐、當轉隴海快車赴歸德、（二日）</p>

<h3>十萬元</h3>
<p>庫劵鉅騙案</p>
<p>福泰錢　亦騙去四千元</p>
<p>字跡圖章均與往日無異</p>
<p>北京路一百二十六號通益信託公司、前由温州阜資錢莊無條件寄存公債庫劵十萬元、詎至八月卅一日、接到阜資由温州來信、謂派人將庫券提去翌日、即有自稱朱明者來、即如數交付、詎忽接温州阜資來電、謂該莊書柬圖章等、忽已遺失着將庫劵注意保管、一律止付、通益即復電、謂已由朱明如數取去該莊即派人來滬調查眞相知有</p>
<p>温州人戴鼎甫者　於此案頗有嫌疑、正在杭州擬將庘劵出賣、遂由告訴入林壽梅往杭將戴獲案、同時尙獲徐伯華名惟徐訊供無關、當塲開釋、戴即提解至上海特區第一法院並供出此案主犯係曾六林、及朱驤、二人住在南京路東亞旅館五百十一號房間、即由捕房往拘時曾·朱·二人適不在當塲拘獲在杭州曾被拘而釋放之徐伯華一名及温州人趙洛書陳蘇生·陳遠耀·等數人解於法院經一度審訊、　　趙陳陳三人無干　開釋、一方並由法院函温州地方法院調查、有無金城錢莊委派戴鼎甫到申向中南·鹽業二銀行接洽生意、（因戴曾供受該莊之委托來滬接洽生意也）並傳通益信託公司及同時受騙之福泰錢莊經理等一併到案審理、昨届庭期、由江公亮推事承審、首由戴鼎甫供稱二十一歳、温州人業錢莊、在杭州被拘、據我被拘緣由捕者説爲</p>
<p>曾六林騙走公債　因我與彼相識、涉有嫌疑、然我並不知情、至此捕房律師起稱該戴鼎甫係由杭州拘來、彼與曾六林在滬相遇、曾即託彼到杭州與農工銀行接洽出售債劵事、並給予五百元、作爲應酬費經告訴人温州阜資錢莊經理林壽梅探悉、報局被拘、至於徐伯華部份、有温州旅滬同鄉會及温州初級公立中學來函證明、謂徐與案無關、且有職業</p>
<p>惟有可疑者二點　（一）當彼在捕房供稱無業、與曾在一處、係向之謀業（二）曾六林先到滬、徐係後來、何以徐　杭州彼拘釋放後、又在上海曾處被拘據徐伯華供、在温州公立中學爲會計、來滬原因係代學校購買儀器物於八月廿八日從杭州抵滬到實學通藝館照單配貨與曾六林相識、因從前被曾爲我介紹牙醫生、且爲同鄉、自到滬後、即住在香賓旅社、凡屬温州同鄉來滬、多居是處其時曾姓亦來看我到滬時、與戴姓同輪、時捕房律師又起稱、當徐在杭被拘</p>
<p>訊無關係而釋放　其時告訴人林壽梅在杭拘獲戴鼎甫後返滬、而徐亦追蹤同乘一車而行直接到東亞旅社報告曾六林·此種行動殊有可疑、訊之徐供、在滬時彼曾訪我是日適我往訪故不期被拘、次由通易信託公司代表李文杰述稱、與温州阜資向有來往、曩以五萬元編遣庫劵、及五萬元十九年善後庫劵、共計十萬元庫劵無條件存在公司、八月三十一日接到温州阜資錢莊二十七日所發一信、謂存劵叧有他用、特託朱明來提翌日即有朱明持叧一信及名片來到察其</p>
<p>來信及筆跡印鑑　語氣與歷來來信及最近之來信無二、當場信任而交付詎旣付之後下午忽得阜資來電謂圖章遺失債劵止付然已不及、况該朱明臨行並謂該債劵是月底之政府付還之本息、可逕介福泰錢莊其數約有一千餘元、因素知該二家素有往來、向來亦如此辦法、更是使人不疑、其圖騙之手段、實十分縝密也、次由福泰錢莊代理人金潤甫稱、與阜資向有往來、此事未發生前、有一二千欠欵八月廿八日、並到阜資來信謂特派陳壽卿來支洋四千元翌日、即有自稱陳某者來提欵、字跡圖章、與向日往來者無異、無從察破、</p>
<p>故當即照付不疑　後得阜資電報、方知被騙然已交付、祗得回電説已介至此次捕房律師要求將提欵之四信、交與捕房、查騐筆跡、因徐·戴·二人捕房中有親筆口供存在可以核對對於已逃之曾六林·朱相·要否提起公訴、亦於下次庭期解决、因捕房向例、被告獲案後、方肯起訴也、至此庭諭改期再訊、並傳原告林壽梅同到　審、</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>痛心的話</h3>
<p>— 鵑</p>
<p>親愛的國人。西方有一句諺語呌做「以一齒報一　　齒。以一目報一目。」Ａｔｏｏｔｈｆｏｒａｔｏｏｔｈａｎｅｙｅｆｏｒａｎｅｙｅ意思是有咬我一口的。我還咬他一口。瞅我一眼的。我也還瞅他一眼。這原是很公平的辦法。而我國人之對外是怎様。咬我一口。我自己撫摩一下算了。瞅我一眼。我低下頭去算了。甚至於外人要批我的面頰。我以面頰凑到他的手頭。外人要砍我的腦袋。我以腦袋迎到他的刀上。唉。此之謂禮讓。此之謂容忍。此之謂愛好和平。</p>
<p>不除庭艸齋夫談薈</p>
<h3>大掃除</h3>
<p>有人問我：「你爲什麽要向自由談投稿？」我説：「我就是愛他那自由兩字。」我見了自由談便聯想到兒童的自由，婦女的自由，被壓迫民衆的自由，世界弱小民族的自由。我在這裏要開自由之砲，破奴隷之城，繳奴主之械,解奴隷之鐐，不使人頀再有奴隷，要人人都成爲自由人。有人説奴隷也是有自由的。何以呢？他没有做奴隷之前一定有出處的自由。還是做自由人奮鬥而死，還是做亡國奴乞憐而活，在這中間，他豈没有自由的選擇？所以除非是他自己死心塌地情願做奴隸，誰也没有力量呌他做奴隸。我們所要連根掃除的便是這種奴隸性。這種奴隸性不掃除乾凈，則自由的世界是永遠不會實現。好。𠴰們來他一個大掃除吧！�</p>
<p>「誰有自由筆？</p>
<p>一起來掃地！</p>
<p>掃到那一天？</p>
<p>地上無奴隸！」</p>
<h3>瀋陽歸客痛語</h3>
<p>— 蔣劍意</p>
<p>友人姜君健行。服務瀋陽兵工廠。十　　九日日寇襲城之變。君實躬與其難。一昨間道變服南歸。去死間不容髮。爲言日軍獸性暴行。令人髮指。今紀其所言三事如下。</p>
<p>日軍之入瀋陽也。旣攻北大營兵工廠得手。同時全城警察。皆已繳械。遂由浪人爲導。狼奔豕突。攔入人家。商店則責令遍懸日旗。姜時寓其友郭君家。郭在商埠營有雜貨商店。携眷屬内居。十九日晨。在砲火聲中。爲日軍擁入。郭君圖避。日軍倒曳出。責令速懸日旗。倉卒無以應。則羣蹴痛撻。於哀呼宛轉中。彈畢命。姜偕郭君老母及眷屬正乘隙謀逃。日軍在後瞄準。彈至如雨。老母先躓。郭君已不及見。姜則仆地傷額。血流被面。僅以身免。昏惘中猶聞郭婦慘呼。爲逼入隔室。其聲哀厲。令聞者摧毁心肝。姜君言時泣下。謂此仇不雪。如枉戴頭顱何。</p>
<p>日軍旣大舉殺人。街衢間積屍塞路。日人不問情由。見華裝者即槍殺。尤以學生裝及中山裝者萬無生理。姜君親見工人裝束及學生裝者十餘人。坌息而逃。面無人色。其後日軍追逐。至避無可避。逼令負牆駢立。以日語申申詈已。一一行戮。其逃者亦飮彈而亡。無一倖免。姜君臥積屍中。以背承日軍蹴踏而過。謂雖不死。其傷心慘目。實較身死尤哀。</p>
<h3>世界小事記</h3>
<p>巴黎的時式手套　　法京巴黎。可説是全世界時髦的婦女的中心點。一切衣服與裝飾。常在推陳出新。而引起其他各國的倣傚。最近巴黎的婦女。又在手套上想出新花様來。便是把伊們的纖纖玉手。戴一雙顏色各别的手套。往往一隻手戴白手套。而一隻手戴黑手套。一隻手戴綠手套。而一隻手戴紅手套。這風氣一開。時髦的婦女便人人戴起兩色手套來。於是專售婦女衣飾的商店。也趕辦這種兩色手套。以應伊們的需求。　　新發明的麵包製造機西方人甚麽都講經濟。旣要金錢上經濟。又要時間上經濟。所以經濟而發明的新事物。就層出不窮了。最近有一位意大利人。發明一架麵包製造機。他在一頭將榖類放進去。一霎時磨成細粉。而知别的成分混合在一起。只須二十分鐘。已經製成麵包。隨即烘好。可以立時給你果腹。</p>
<p>姜弟凌霄。肄業東北最高學府。其學校被圍之夜。先見砲火燭天。全校皆起。繼聞殺聲動地。日軍潮湧而來。姜弟幾膏利刃。憤不欲生。其後逃出尋兄。至今離散。健行旣逃至皇姑屯。見難民中其弟同學亦在。始知凌霄出校消息。特逃散後迄今踪跡杳然。意者鐵蹄雜　之中。已以頸血濺我喪土。健行上有老母。獨鍾愛幼兒。自謂逃死須曳中。所見斷腹揕胸流血横屍之慘。輒復憶及其弟。嗟乎。與爲孱奴。寗爲雄鬼。吾不暇爲凌霄哀。亦無以塞健行之悲也。感書四絶於後。萬刦終成今日變。人間無地可貪生。紛紛歌哭尋常事。喋血彊塲要有人。石破天驚又此回。身殘心死有餘哀。果然方式三韓様。十萬頭顱換不歸。痛哭陳詞百不堪。此何如事莫空談。荷干擐甲沙塲死。斬得倭奴有未甘。泣血椎心永不忘。萬人號泣願偕亡。已非鎭靜從容日。力挽强弓射太陽。（移酬助賑）</p>
<h3>殲倭寇之木瀆敵樓</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>依然雉堞瞰河濱。小小嚴關禦敵人。　　今日烽烟久消歇。夕陽芳草對殘春此詩人王汝玉詠木瀆救樓之什也。敵樓在白塔橋堍。方廣十三丈有奇。高三丈六尺。累石爲基。四面甃甎。旁列洞孔以發矢石銃砲。予艤舟香谿。曾游憩於其下地。旣　曠望靈嚴支硎之秀。近在眉睫令人作仰止景行之想。洵佳地也。考諸縣志。是樓乃明嘉靖間。巡按御史尙維持建。爲木瀆十景之一。相傳嘉靖三十四年。倭寇自楓橋往木瀆西山等處。焚掠殆徧。兵備任環。與總兵湯克寛率健卒來。寇竄入太湖。焚刦洞庭兩山。旣而又擾至寳帶橋。爲任環部下所圍。寇潰圍過五龍橋。奔梅灣。越日。又奔喪巖山。任環搜捕之。殲寇甚衆。即敵樓地也。任環死。居民立廟於走馬塘。塑其遺像。供奉香火。所以不忘勦寇之巨功也。惜兵燹後。廟像改易無復舊時衣冠矣。際此東海揚波寇犯日亟。不知世有任公其人乎。雖爲之執鞭。固所願也。任公。字應乾。　安人。特表誌之。以爲今日勦倭之模範人物。</p>
<h3>迷信公理的中國和平民族</h3>
<p>— 胡靜屏</p>
<p>近來除了少數人覺悟到「公理」二字　　不大可靠外。其餘的還在迷信着這捉不住。看不見。兑現不到的「公理」我們但看許多人依然在那裏指望着國聯或美國（甚至俄國）出來帮忙。就可知道。　　據我看。迷信公理是一句冠冕堂皇用以自欺的話。其實正是我們中國人怯懦</p>
<h3>抗日救國根本問題芻議（三）</h3>
<p>— 寄萍</p>
<p>抵制日貨。是中國目前最急切的工作。祗要我們努力抵制下去。三年以後。我敢預言日本　　一定會發現三種恐怖的現象。（一）大規模的工商業完全停頓。只殘劉一部供給本國的需求。（二）因工商業停頓而經濟起了極度的恐慌。内部必致醖釀惡化。（三）人民與政府對抗。政治上發生變亂。到那時候。日本帝國主義。自會趨於軟化。而一變他們猙獰的面目。所以説最後的勝利。於歸於我們的。但是抵制日貨。還是消極的救國辦法。第一先要增進生產。能以貨抵貨。纔是積極抵制的策略。故以現實的情形而論。這兩件事要同時並進。不可偏廢。因爲只抵制而不生產。我們還是要需用洋貨。利權依然外溢。惟有自己製造。才能塞住漏巵。下列幾點。也可以作參考。</p>
<p>（一）工商界各業領袖。應首先發起添辦工廠。集合股本。或由海内外資本家踴躍投資。先造那一種貨物。視其需要的緩急而定。原有的國貨工廠。宜昨用這機會。設法增進生產。擴充營業。政府加以奬勵。減免捐税。　如以現社會最需要的棉紗而言。三十六支四十二支的細紗。幾乎完全是日本貨。現在來路旣經截斷了。急需有同様的代用品。那末華商紗廠聯合會應召集會議。討論如何添辦細紗椗。趕緊出貨。以應急切的需求。倘再徘徊不進。簡直是自暴自棄。其他各業。也當召集同業。切實合作。消除「同業必妒」最卑劣的心理。</p>
<p>（二）上海及各地日本工商業機關。都有罷工歇業的趨勢。我中國的員工們。都有專長的技能。國貨工廠應相機延聘。最好組織一個機關。辦理登記。安置這班人。同時政府及社會各方面。應當協力救濟他們失業後的生活問題。</p>
<p>（三）上海應先試辦一個研究機關。最好由抗日會主辦。羅致有經騐的工商業專門人才。先從調查入手。把日本貨的種類·品質·價格……精密的統計。加以詳細的研究。做各種報告書。供國貨工廠作參攷。最近回國的留日工商人才。都可以來參加這種工作。　　（四）實業部早有籌設五大工廠的計劃。用國家的財力來辦。的確容易辦到。可是這五大工廠。遲遲不進。不知何年何代才能成功。其實我們中國要辦大實業。原料有。資本有。人才也有。可惜熱心提倡的人太缺乏了。</p>
<p>現在京粤兩方。還算明白大義。全國哀求「和平統一」和中山先生彌留時「和平統一救中國」的遺言。重復可以實現了。然而和平統一還得有永久的保障。賢能政府也該迅速產生。我很希望我們的賢能政府。也頒佈五年計劃。把國防·内政·外交·敎育·工商·交通·……依照具體的方案。限期完成建設。興中華。報國仇。雖説是政府之職責。我四萬萬同胞。更當共同努力。促其實現。自私·依賴·苟且等等劣性情的表現。堂堂一個國家。有兵有將有人民。却想在被人欺侮的時候。望别國來帮忙。即使有這回事的實現。我也認爲是在被人欺侮的第一重國恥外。再加上忍辱受人恩惠的第二重國恥而已。然而現在中國人丨丨大多數丨丨居然是都在夢想國聯會討伐日本。或是美國調來大兵若干。把日本人從東三省全趕走。我們却安尼觀望。坐享其成。一般所謂黨國要人。仍舊據地自肥。擁兵自衛。幹那在猢猻當中稱王的把戲。嗚呼。要是一個稍有自尊心的人。誰能甘受這無上的恥辱。而中國人在危亡的時候。偏有這種卑鄙的希望。</p>
<p>中國人眞是和平的民族。（這句話是除去了對内而言）不説自己不爭氣。偏説别人强横。不説自己懦怯。偏説别人野蠻。而且在温飽無事之時。還要高唱其世界大同的論調。自詡高明。可是像我們這種自賤自卑的民族。誰肯和你「大同」以自降强國的身份。切實點説。要想世界大同。除非是在中國戰勝了日本而也排列到幾大强國的行伍中去的時候。不然。迷信公理。和空喊世界大同的中國人。可以休矣。</p>
<p>更正前日「記甲午之戰韓世昌殉難事一」文。「韓世昌」實係「鄧世昌」之誤。鄧氏後人馳名商界者有鄧君瑞人。爲杭州鄧莊之主人。特此更正。兼謝來函見告之顧之槃先生。</p>
<p>説部扶輪會</p>
<h3>敲夢的杵（三）</h3>
<p>— 程瞻廬</p>
<p>「居士，假使一二百年前的中國在你眼前實現，你見了，作麽生　　？」</p>
<p>「要是實現，我便做我的太平之民了」；「此間樂，不思蜀」。「實現容易，祗須你坐上這張轉輪椅子」。長老指着中間這張椅子説。</p>
<p>「老和尙，果眞麽」？陶遲口中咀嚼着芋艿，含糊地説。</p>
<p>「老僧不打誑，居士一坐上椅子，管敎你實現那夢想的十八世紀的太平無事的中國」。</p>
<p>「坐上椅子，難道可使年光倒流」？陶遲很驚異的説。「單使年光倒流，還不能顯出轉輪椅的妙用；這張轉輪椅，却有三般不可思議的功效：丨丨一可使年光順流，二可使年光倒流三可使年光不流」。「老和尙的話太奇妙了，請道其詳」。</p>
<p>「居士，請你多吃幾枚芋艿，待老僧講給你聽。年光是隨着地球轉動而變遷，地球周圍二萬五千哩，旣能在二十四小時中自轉一周；那麽在赤道上地球轉動的速率，每小時應在一千哩以上。中國位置在温帶地方，距着赤道尙遠；準着地球自轉的公例，離着赤道愈遠，自轉的速率也愈减；假定我們所居的地方，每小時轉動的速率是八百哩；一坐上這張轉輪椅；輪的轉動，比着地球自轉要快千萬倍，便是地球每小時自轉八百哩，轉輪的速率便有千萬倍的八百哩；在地球上度日子，祗過得小時，而在轉輪椅上度日子，已過了千萬小時了。所以一坐上轉輪椅子，坐了一小時，便可見千萬小時以後的未來歷史；這便呌做可使年光順流」。</p>
<p>「請問年光倒流是怎麽解」？</p>

<p>厘拆價格（洋釐）早市厘價爲七錢二分四厘八毫七忽半、午市爲七錢二分五厘一毫二忽半、結果較前日市價上落僅一毫二忽半間、（銀拆）早市二錢、與前晨同、午市一錢四分、較前午又小一分、銀行掛牌仍爲八分、劃頭加水毫無行市、一律白劃、</p>

<h3>證劵鹽税跌二元九角</h3>
<p>其他跌逾一元關税獨漲</p>
<p>昨證劵交易所各債市况現貨無交易、期貨續祇十月期一種、十一月期仍未開出、而十月期以須現品提供、市面依然平靜、以日本對我東北陰謀益亟、買方又呈觀望遂令市上賣出交易、又佔優勢雖未有　大漲落、而忽漲忽跌迄未有一致之傾向、結果較前日計鹽税下降達二元九角、二0關捲統税一九善整六等各回跌一元五六角、其他上落尙微、獨關税比前日續漲一元一角、察債市之形勢、現仍未易測知、外交之能否轉機、當仍爲債價漲落之重大原因云、計期貨交易上午六百數十萬、後市約二百九十萬合計九百十五萬元、</p>

<h3>紗花紗市晨疲午俏</h3>
<p>紗市晨平午漲、趨勢依然紊亂、以世界大勢狀况十分悲觀、而對日經濟絶交、日紗不能通銷、轉靠華紗、不足供給、故各廠現貨早已抽空、市價當然騰漲、然迥顧金融情形枯竭、四方水災甚烈、價格抬高、現銷或滯、午後商場上謠傳印度商有大量購進説、故漲風愈激、</p>
<p>後市人標漲一二兩　人標前市開盤、以外棉不振、且上日有大戶將多頭之額吐出不少、市氣尤鬆各月一兩外、二三盤又回漲、結果平平、午後市盤驟漲一二兩不等、全日成交統計六萬二千九百包、查賣出達記二千五百包、勞興一千六百包、賡豐一千三百包、森康一千四百五十包、長豐二千三百包、義餘一千八百五十包、買進和愼一千二百包、公泰一千八百包、義成二千三百包、益昶一千零五十包、信誠一千四百五十包、德記一千一百五十包、茲將收盤價錄左、人標收盤價漲跌存賬數</p>

<h3>棉市被美花帶落</h3>
<p>美棉跌風劇烈、且逐步發現新低價、而形勢萬分險惡、各洋行在市兜銷現棉甚亟、價格特别低廉、今價較上日低一兩許、本廠雖有購進、然視大勢不良、皆不敢盡量吸收、本棉交易完全被外棉搶佔、印度翁默拉棉價祇合二十三兩、（在印）與標棉價低過十餘兩、此種狀况、爲歷來所罕見、照此情形、將後美印兩棉、滬上均有滿坑滿谷之患也、前途不敢預料、</p>

<h3>糧食河下米市步鬆</h3>
<p>南頭昨日來源尙湧、計三四十號、本街市銷突滯、新粳因同里價軟划申較廉、惟蘇市仍定、買戶因貨旺、進胃告淡、行情因降三角、新洋杜尖步跌二角、早稻薄稻形勢呆弱、價帶軟化、百哥稻一時興、銷路忽懈、特頂貨悉短角半、糯米陰化來貨雖稱絡繹、各銷則尙活動、價無榮辱　　新閘來源略有、存底亦厚、去路不振、西新頂粳仍在十六元左右、中關宿次低二三角、大勢難以振作、厚薄破脚地雖告獨穩、然亦欠佳、故價回落近角、南帮薄稻百哥走銷尤滯、價批落四五角、新洋蘆尖尙有小數鄉胃、盤面得以站定、茭白尖亦軟二角、</p>
<h3>期現米又跌五七分</h3>
<p>小絞米續有訂定　　回籠米跌一錢</p>
<p>昨日洋米愈開愈小、而新交易則有洋行兜攬、形勢更軟、昨由錦隆售出三月份小絞三千噸、價五兩半、比前日小七分、回籠貨十月份小絞五兩二錢、十一月份又過磅貨五兩三錢二分、比前市又小一錢以上、小絞現米開五百包、高十一元八角、又小五分、中關貨則十一元六角、後市仍居軟象云、</p>
<h3>粉市暴落之因果</h3>
<p>昨日粉市又呈暴落之態、以洋麥報價又小二三四角不等、且近期價又爲國外之最低紀錄、由此推想國外之過剩、尙未脱危險之境、而國内情形、洋麥來源不絶前之所定者、又接續進口、在表面上雖未達過剩、然以廠家存底豐厚、雜糧業之浮存小麥、迄未過問、可見供求之間、早已發生問題、如外埠多頭、對此水盡山窮之時、祗好猛力回出、以求解决、此風不動則已、動則非跌不可、連日之步落不已、即屬此故也、結果本月份較前日跌二分二厘半、十一月份跌三分、十二月份跌二分半、一月份跌三分、二月份跌二分半、三月份跌二分云、</p>
<h3>麥價又開最低紀錄</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面又一致疲落、因洋麥報價旣復逐步回跌、且低落之程度、又開最低紀錄、而市塲空氣、近期震於洋麥甚湧、遠期有洋麥爲比較、人心不振、一般長江路客帮、逐見回出、致各月份開價均不見佳、觀察後步、如果洋麥湧到後、出路未能解决、恐變動之來、尙屬不可測也、結果本月份較前日跌五分、十一·十二月份跌五分、一月份跌四分、二月份跌五分、三月份較前日上市則跌九分、現麥交易甚寂、昨開崑山麥三兩五錢四分、三兩四錢、計四百包、由華豐辦去、</p>
<p>糖市　太古糖廠盤步昻</p>
<p>粗砂白盛開五千餘袋</p>
<p>昨日古巴糖價仍一·四0六二五、紐約期糖十二月份一·三九、比較前電升二分、三月份一·三五、五月份一·三九、各升五分、九月份新價一·四八、爪哇現糖價七·五00、期糖各月份均七·六二五、比前仍乏起伏、公會劃盤荷糖二十四號粗砂白買氣活動、新貨成交價爲十一兩四錢至五錢、高貨粗粒者十一兩六錢、貨且缺乏、二十號中砂白十兩0九錢、綿荷白十一兩九錢、碗青八兩三錢、九號荷赤九兩四錢、市形堅秀、太古糖ＤＹＨＸ嘜市存仍寥、ＨＭ嘜十一兩六錢半、Ｂ嘜十二兩二錢半、趨勢頗挺、華新開出五百包、價亦十一兩二錢半、號盤有禎祥售開新中砂白一千餘袋、價十兩0九錢、陳粗砂白三千袋、價十一兩二錢、油袋貨亦售開二千六百袋、價十一兩、行方買意頗濃、如數售通、太古糖廠盤又喊漲五分、經已有人問津、尙須回電作實、於此可見市象之　達矣、</p>
<h3>南北貨金針菜一再回降</h3>
<p>金針菜前以走場暢盛、頂莊菜曾一度升至二十九兩外、而號盤亦甚緊俏、熟知邇來各處銷胃漸見减少、於是由俏轉疲、一再回降、前後已跌去二兩左右、近日惟粤閩等屬尙有去路、數均不多、昨市頂莊菜售二十七兩、上中莊自二十一兩半至十九兩、中次莊十八兩半、市氣平疲、　　絲茶　貢熙茶俄銷旺盛昨日婺源·屯溪兩路貢熙綠茶、俄國協助會進意續趨殷濃、全市成交九百餘箱、頂盤開出五十五兩、視前無漲落、針眉·鳳眉·蕊眉·蝦目等項、亦略有零星交易、市價堅定、惟最關重要之珍眉綠茶、全市均無人問訊、茶市前途、未能認爲樂觀也、</p>
<p>五金　美白鐵逐步高陞</p>
<p>美白鐵近因各帮採辦甚踴躍、而到源甚鮮、行情步高、四十八張每担可售至十八兩六錢、比前又漲錢半、二十八號十九兩二錢半、二十六號十八兩五錢、二十四號十七兩五錢、亦比前好一錢、而交易尤以四十八張爲最踴躍統計昨市售出達三四百担、聞後批到貨甚少、故人心良佳、而行情仍有繼續升漲之望、</p>
<h3>青鉛每况愈下</h3>
<p>青鉛交易、近來奇少、雖海外連電報漲、但本埠人心因實銷不多、仍無振作氣象、價格受不良環境之壓迫、故有每况愈下之概、刻估十五兩二錢半、比前竟跌二三錢、據最近一般人心之推測、恐行情一節、將來或須再跌也、</p>
<p>雜訊　美棉二千件昨已進口、</p>

<h3>血鐘響了</h3>
<p>— 羅家樑作</p>
<p>呵、</p>
<p>起來、</p>
<p>同胞們、</p>
<p>大家起來、</p>
<p>靠不了國聯、</p>
<p>靠不了旁人、</p>
<p>最靠得住的、</p>
<p>是我們自身、</p>
<p>我們不能妥協、</p>
<p>更用不着和平、</p>
<p>誓以頭顱熱血、</p>
<p>奪回東北主權、</p>
<p>我們要羣策羣力、</p>
<p>我們要奮勇殺敵、</p>
<p>我們要直搗東京、</p>
<p>我們要痛飮長崎、</p>
<p>同胞們、再不忍耐了、</p>
<p>我們在不能倫生了、</p>
<p>你看、强暴的日本兵、</p>
<p>巳經踏平了瀋陽城、</p>
<p>想、東三省是誰的國土、</p>
<p>東北人民是誰的手足、</p>
<p>呵、東北同胞已殉難了、　　踏着他們的血泊殺去、</p>

<p>都不要懼怕、也用不着躊躇、</p>
<p>倭奴的鐵蹄、踐踏着祖國的江山、</p>
<p>屠殺我們的同胞、是倭奴的槍彈、</p>
<p>好吧、就來拚拚、我們有的是熱血、</p>
<p>我們願意犧牲、爲了中華的主權、</p>
<p>拜倫爲甚從軍、不是爲希臘的沈淪、</p>
<p>黃海爲甚怒吼、不是爲神州的陸沉、</p>

<p>正當的、死是正當的、爲着祖國的自由、</p>
<p>光榮的、死是光榮的、爲着祖國的自由、</p>
<h3>孩子們的氣概</h3>
<p>— 黃奐若</p>
<p>此文寫就待發、倭寇</p>
<p>已大舉犯我東省、髮</p>
<p>指眦裂、舉國同憤、我</p>
<p>不知小孩們得到這個</p>
<p>消息後、又將怎様的</p>
<p>憤慨呢、</p>
<p>雪妹因爲有事不能去校授課、要我暫代好的職務、於是孩子氣的我居然跑上了講台、指手劃脚地當起「先生」來了、　　「猢狲王」的生活不一定像人們所詛咒的坐「冷板凳」様的討厭、我是素來羨慕小學敎員的自然與偉大的、不是爲了更大的使命擱負在肩上、也許我也是小學敎育界上的一員小將呢、</p>
<p>孩子們對於我的感情似乎很不錯、上課時天眞地聽着我的講述、看着我的表演、縱使他們是本能地歡喜動、但並不怎様的嘈雜、散了課、辦公桌的同圍聚集了許多的孩子、散步的時候、身畔蜂擁着許多的孩子、「先生、」「先生、」的呼聲不絶地送入耳膜、問長問短、熱烈地等待我的答復、這情境是融恰的、是美麗的、</p>
<p>講故事、孩子們最歡喜聽、利用這機會、許多的補充敎材給我攙入在這裏、歷史上的故事、足以培植健全的國民性的、盡量地灌輸、趁此收暗移默化之效、某優生學家説、中國是一個没有希望的國家、因爲中國民族的先天是一個惡劣的種子、我是堅决地反對這種荒謬的論調、我始終認爲民族的優劣、全視敎育的程度而决定的、敎育的功效、不是死的注入、而是海的感化、孩子們歡喜聽故事、有益他們心性的敎材便是一個陶治的最好機會　　歷史到了近代的階段、許多可以振發民族精神的事蹟遺留着、一天、把關於中日間歷史上的關係編成了一段故事、準備講給他們聽、日本、這兩字祗要在口頭提及、就是窮鄕僻壤間的民衆、聽了也會憤火冒上心頭、「矮奴」的駡聲吐出了民衆們的口唇、孩子們聽到要講到日本人、大家都十分地表示贊成、「萬寳山慘案」幾個字也浮盪在孩子們的羣隊中、</p>
<p>從中日的怎様發生關係講起、講到中日戰爭、講到二十一條、講到萬寳山慘案、最後講到日本兵的越界干涉反日會的檢查工作、搶刦反日會檢查出的仇貨的事件、孩子們聽的聚精會神、異常的興奮、但和平時却有些不同、笑　並未掛上他們天眞的小臉、眉峰緊鎖着、顯然天眞平安的童心也起了不平靜的波痕、</p>
<p>「先生、那末、我們中國人爲什麽不和他們開戰呢、」一個孩子懷疑地而又憤懣地開口問了、</p>
<p>「我們的軍器没有他們那麽的精、没有他們那様的多、戰不過他們、」我這様不自然地回答、</p>
<p>「那末、我們是没有希望的了、我們要做亡國奴了、是不是、」另一個搶着問　　他的身子已從座位上立了起來、幾十個滿懷着驚疑的小臉、都眼珠直射着我的臉、自然迫待着我的答話、</p>
<p>「這也不然、祇要我們肯力圖自振、也是可以成爲强國的、但是、假使永遠這様的昏迷不醒、那是眞的没有希望的了、」我是這様的説、我很快活、孩子們還没有眞如某優生學家所説的那様不堪造就、因爲他們的熱烈很充分地表顯着自覺的痕跡、</p>
<p>「先生、要不做亡國奴、是不是要救國、要救國是不是應該抵制日貨、」</p>
<p>「對了、我們要救國、我們要抵制日貨、諸位、你們家裏有没有日本貨、你自己没有日本貨、希望你們以後不要再買日本貨、」我是很熱烈地和他們講、孩子們也很熱烈地在聽、「還有、除了抵制日貨以外、不要忘記其它的外國貨也是不可買、除非非用外貨不可的時候、再有一點、希望小朋友們努力的、便是你們要誠懇地去勸你們的親戚朋友、從今以後、大家要親愛、要團結、一切的困難要聯合起來去打破、一起的事業要互助的去努力、這様外國人方才不敢來欺侮、我們中國方才有富强的一天、」</p>
<p>這一課算是激昻慷慨地在鈴聲中下課了、孩子們不像平日一般的平靜、熱烈的勇敢的一種愛國的高潮醖釀在孩子們的羣中、</p>
<p>隔了一天、當我們幾個敎師到村中散步的時候、居然看見了幾個孩子正在對農人們宣傳他們的救國方針、農人們也覺悟地痛咒着日本人、點首地稱讚着孩子們所講的方針、</p>
<p>這様、熱烈的反日空氣便洋溢在全村了、</p>
<p>孩子們的氣概眞是不凡、誰説中華民族是無望的、</p>
<h3>抗日聲中之交大</h3>
<p>— 荃</p>
<p>交通大學、在以往學生運動占有光榮之歷史、年來該校人才輩出、在工程界科學界中占有相當位置着、　學校當局培植之功、而愛國運動亦不無影響也、此次日人暴行、噩耗傳到、該校學生自治會代表大會、迭開臨時緊急會議、議决召集全體大會、討論救國辦法、開會時全體同學均出席、濟濟蹌蹌、開從來未有之紀錄、主席報告日人暴行後、全場空氣頓形悽慘、有掩面而泣者、有放聲狂哭者、當時全體議决即日組織抗日救國委員會、辦理以下各項事務、</p>
<p>（一）軍事訓練該校軍事訓練、原本嚴格、學生均荷槍實彈、每星期操練二		次、成績頗有可觀、上次訓練總監部閲操至該校、嘆爲觀止、曾由部中傳令嘉奬、現以外侮日亟、學生亟宜武裝救國、特加緊軍事訓練、凡學生未輪到演講者、均須每日操演四小時、敎授二小時、晚間並露宿帳中、並實行演習野戰情形、務使學生他日效命疆塲時、得有充分之軍事智識與日人决鬥云、</p>
<p>（二）軍用化學該校化學敎授徐名材氏、本係漢陽兵工廠總工程師、於軍用化學深有研究、現該氏特加多研究鐘點、埋首試騐室中、準備研究一種（ＭｕｓｔａｎｄＧａｓＣＩ·Ｃ２Ｈ４·Ｃ２Ｈ４ＣＩ·）爲戰爭時之用、期以六月必底於成、助彼研究者、爲化學名家張懷義氏云、</p>

<p>還有其他各地飛行場、正在進行建設中、他日馬來亞半島各飛機塲完成後、不特郵遞快捷、就是乘客航空旅行、也可達到的、</p>
<p>結言</p>
<p>我的結言是、馬來亞飛機塲、等到星羅棋佈、極其縝密的時候、不特馬來亞本身的郵務交通、可有長足的發展、就是歐·非·亞·澳·的經濟與文化、也必有驚人的進步、這種説話、是從其好的方面來觀察的、若就其壞的方面來觀察、世界經濟陷於不景氣的危崖、英國猶拚死力地發展英澳的航空、則其别有會中可知了、蓋英國的殖民地、綿亘歐·非·亞·澳·諸洲、若非有靈敏的軍事力量做保障、在在有失掉的危險、其在新加坡建設軍港、與發展英澳航空的用意、無非欲取得軍事上的連絡、藉以永久保有其旣得屬地與權益而已、是以馬來亞航空盡量發展之日、英國就如虎添翼、其在歐·非·亞·澳·的地位、尤其是在遠東的地位、就穩如泰山而不能動撼了、（完）</p>
<h3>日本對付東北附屬地陰</h3>
<p>險手段的一航丘·耀·民·</p>
<p>日帝國主義這次武裝對華侵略之爆發、實不是偶然的舉動、而是有他深長的根據、這我們祇要觀察他平時對東北的經營、更可概見一般了、去年我因事到東北去、親自見聞、日帝國主義對付當地附屬地人民的種種陰的剛柔手段、現特縷述如次、由此、大概總可看出日帝國主義者孜孜汲汲經營東北之决心及其這次奪地殺人的舉動吧、</p>
<p>（一）公開設立鴉片小賣所鴉片小賣所不但城市方面（如大連頭道溝……）遍地林立、即鄕村僻壤地隨處皆是、像登沙河很小的鄕下公開鴉片用賣所便有兩所、大連不計其數、長春頭道溝大概總不下七八十家、據泰東報調查所得、則大連一處每日鴉片小賣所的總收入數達四千餘元、我們試一進這些鴉片小賣所去便可看見無數的同胞在呑雲吸霧、「一生事業樂（？）燈花」、什麽事都不管了、不但如</p>

<p>此、最兇毒的嗎啡、海羅英……復隨處有賣、且普及最苦之百姓、由是、我們同胞的頭腦麻木了、他們便更容易統治了、　　（二）施小惠去寵絡人民日本人對待租借地人民的手段、最毒辣的、最陰險的、要算是施小惠的手段了、因爲如此、一般頭腦昏庸、眼光狹小的人民、便會對他們歌功誦德、便會趨附他們、像敎人怎樣種棉花、施醫……都不惜工本、盡心竭力、有一次我親眼看見二三日本人在鄕下萍果樹田中、「無料」的爲人民剪萍果樹枝丨無用的枝樹丨那時大雨臨頭、一般聽他講授植物生理的老百姓都溜了大吉、而這幾位愛民如赤子（？）的日本人却仍冒雨工作、你想怎不令人感服、</p>
<p>（三）强行收買土地日帝國主義者一方面施用陰柔的手段、另方面却不惜露其猙獰的面孔、現其蠻横强惡的手段、像强行收買土地便是其中最主的例子、聽說土地任由他們關東廳規定價目丨最低的價目、便實行强買、</p>
<p>以上所列不過其中幾種而己、餘如學校、鄕村自治會……都是勾心鬬角、盡其侵略之本能、</p>
<p>現在他們大舉而來了、他們不但要經營租借地、他們要奪取我們的東北三省、他們要滅亡我們整個國家了、起來、武裝驅逐日帝國主義者、收回租借地、</p>
<h3>法將福煦歐戰日記顧·昂·若·譯·</h3>
<p>聯軍的總攻、一九一八年十月十五至十一月十一日、</p>
<p>各路聯軍在北海以至苗斯河之間前進、戰綫長二百哩、分頭進攻、自然不免幾處遇着勁敵、敵軍頑抗的程度如何難以預測、惟有把各軍前面的地勢以及各軍前進的速度加以研究、方可略知一二、但大體上聯軍自右而左、即自苗斯河兩岸的山地以至法蘭特的大平原、地勢愈低愈平、自古至滑鐵蘆、歐洲的命運常是在那裏决定的、</p>
<p>疴亞斯河之北的區域裏、我軍最易運用優勢的兵力、這優勢在現代最重要的是我軍的軍備和軍火的供給超過敵人、英軍在這裏獲得的驚人的進展即其明證、繼續挺進也顯然有利、更以我軍分頭會攻的影響、敵軍在一處所受的打擊不免影響别處、因之别處雖仍足以抵抗也被牽動而動搖了、</p>
<p>十月十日、我請海格元帥注意這形勢、同時、我令貝當貝司令增援英軍右翼的法第一軍、我的訓令内容如下、</p>

<p>疴亞斯河之北、英軍進攻蒙斯阿佛斯南、當天進至瓦西尼·勒加篤·沙勒斯美·杜亞意線、該軍因自南面動搖列藜區域、雷斯河和北海間的法蘭特集團軍則自北面威脅、該集團軍在十月十四已到了穩固的陣地、交通方面絶無顧慮、早在石倫和韋活克間恢復攻勢、形勢甚利、前線撤回的美軍也已調往助戰、更因該方面法軍增加、濮蘇迪將軍遂派往任第六軍軍長、狄高德將軍仍爲比王參謀長、匡助比王指揮戰事、</p>
<p>法蘭特集團軍這様補充之後、即直向韜樂·谷特萊·和蒙明繼續進攻、開展甚速、十四日佔領賀爾特魯勒和摩西爾、十五日攻過谷特馬克、進至谷特萊城下、攻入蒙明和瓦活克、十六日韜樂·列希特韋爾特·亞杜意·伊斯堪、相繼攻下、　　敵軍遂退出全部比利時海岸、沿海砲台以及數年來危害英國和英法交通的潛水艇根據地也全部放棄、</p>
<p>十七日比軍克恢奥斯敦、十九日克恢布倫肯堡和齊布魯治、二十日比軍進至荷蘭邊境和希普同運河、比王亞爾培也準備奏凱重入布魯治了、</p>
<p>五星期前聯軍總司令决定「擊敗比境敵軍恢復雷斯河以北失地」的計劃現由法蘭特集團軍完成、</p>
<p>十月二十二日、我親向比軍祝捷、並且通知他們整理隊伍、恢復交通、聯絡後方、佈置沿海岸陸戰隊策應之後、立即繼續前進、</p>
<p>法蘭特集團軍在北海和雷斯河之間進展之際、英軍右翼也根據計劃續向瓦西尼和沙勒斯方面進攻、十月十七日英第四軍擊破了敵軍頑强的抵抗、佔領了勒加篤、十八十九兩日佔領瓦西尼和沙勒斯、斯把德軍擊退至桑布爾疴亞斯連河的東岸、右翼和英第三軍聯絡渡過塞爾河、佔領沙勒斯（十月二十日）、進至蘭特勒西和摩麻爾林邊（十月二十四日）、　　左翼、英第三軍肅清桑西河南岸、攻過愛加宏河、進至勒格斯諾和凡倫西城下（十月二十四和二十六兩日）、</p>
<p>北方戰事、法蘭特集團軍爲左路和英軍右翼爲右路、兩路並進、同時、英第一第五兩軍担任中路、壓迫正面的敵軍、遂使敵軍實行總退却、敵軍前綫自雷斯河直至史家坡河、十月十七日起開始退却、經十天之久、十月十七日、我軍收復列藜和杜亞意、十八日收復馬爾興和巴興、二十日收復特宗、二十一日收聖亞蒙、二十七日英軍全線進至希爾特河左岸、自都那義以至凡倫西均告克復、　　法蘭特集團軍的右翼重新進攻、渡過雷斯河、十月十九日佔領谷拉義、立即續向希爾特河進逼、達到亞夫爾和都那義間的河岸（十月二十至廿六日）、　　法蘭特集團軍的左翼和中路乘勝於十月卅一日再行進攻、激戰四日、把敵軍擊退至希爾特河右岸、十月十日的軍事計劃遂發展至疴亞斯河之北、</p>
<p>我在十月十九日始能一面繼續把右翼軍向梅齊歐共同目標挺進、一面另調兵力向新目標發展、</p>
<p>我的計劃如下、</p>

Even after the complete withdrawal of the Japanese troops and the restoration of the previous situation, the Chinese government should continue to request the League of Nations to assist in resolving the issues of responsibility and compensation for the events after September 18.

Gu went to Shanghai at 4:30 PM due to business matters, and is scheduled to stay for one or two days and then return to Beijing. (2nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the issue of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the government has already replied to Shi Zhaoji, advising him to return home after the meeting and reluctantly take office as Minister of Foreign Affairs. However, before Shi returns, important diplomatic matters cannot be handled by acting Minister Li Jinlun alone. Therefore, the Special Foreign Affairs Committee is actually in charge of diplomatic affairs. An invitation has been prepared to invite Gu Weijun to join the committee. (2nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Gu Weijun originally planned to return to Beiping immediately. The plane was taken by Zhang to come to Beijing again.

<h3>Chairman Jiang Denies Sending Qi Shiying to Japan</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) On the 1st, a Japanese newspaper reported that a person named Qi Shiying, claiming to have been sent by Chairman Jiang in Tokyo, and also claiming to have been sent by the Central Party Headquarters, was soliciting opinions from Japanese government and public figures. Our agency immediately sent someone to visit Chairman Jiang to inquire. Chairman Jiang said that there was no such thing at all, and that he had not seen this person for a long time. This statement is either a rumor or fabricated by Japanese newspapers. As for the Central Party Headquarters, there is no reason to send Qi Shiying to Japan. Secretary-General Chen Lifu of the Political Council also said that although there is a person named Qi Shiying among the staff of the Central Party Headquarters, he is neither an important person nor has he been to the meeting for a long time, having taken leave of absence from Beijing a long time ago.

<h3>Ministry of Finance Orders All Customs Offices to Strictly Guard Against Japanese Sabotage</h3>

<h3>Feng Yuxiang Expresses Formal Resistance to Aggression</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Feng Yuxiang issued a telegram yesterday, generally stating that today's events require unifying revolutionary forces and unanimously opposing foreign aggression, first making thorough preparations to conform to the true intentions of the people. Now that the foreign threat is imminent, there is no time to waste. If we wait for the League of Nations to advocate, what is the international justice for China, which has suffered the tragedy of being deeply oppressed by imperialism for decades? Only by uniting the masses, unanimously opposing foreign aggression, and urging the national army to go to the front lines and important ports to formally resist the aggression of Japanese imperialism, and to defend the survival of the nation, so as to avenge the supreme humiliation. The survival of China depends on this.

<p>The Responsibility of the Education Sector in the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Movement Since the occurrence of the Japanese atrocities, our country's students and youth have been heartbroken and filled with grief and indignation. Some have thrown down their pens to join the army, some have written blood letters with bitten fingers, and even more have committed suicide in anger to awaken the people of the country. Running and shouting, tears and blood flowing, a kind of patriotism and love for the nation is worthy of praise and tears. A glimmer of hope for the Chinese nation should lie in this. China still has this public sentiment and these young people. We dare to assert that China will not perish. The future of China is still full of unlimited hope.</p>
<p>However, shedding tears and blood, and shouting hoarsely, is ultimately temporary and cannot be sustained. Young people's blood is not yet settled, and their emotions rise and fall unpredictably. Sudden stimulation can make their blood boil, but as things pass, their emotions are also extremely easy to decline. Where is the vitality of the May Fourth Movement era now? Where is the vitality of the Jinan Massacre era now? Today, internal and external troubles are pressing each other, and the lifeblood of the nation remains only a thread. If the people do not make a final awakening and continue their efforts, if they cannot always maintain their vitality and immediately embark on a new journey, then an ancient and declining nation has no chance of survival. Therefore, at this critical moment, how to guide young people onto the right path of struggle, how to guide young people's struggle to be urgent and effective, how to maintain young people's vitality, and help them create a new era, and how to strengthen their will so that their emotions do not rise and fall unpredictably, this is the heavy responsibility that educators across the country should bear in today's anti-Japanese national salvation movement.</p>
<p>We believe that today's China has entered an extraordinary era. The education sector itself should have an extraordinary understanding. Education itself should also have extraordinary education.</p>
<p>What are extraordinary understanding and extraordinary education? We believe:</p>
<p>First, educators themselves should recognize their own country, recognize Japan, and recognize the world. The one who wants to destroy our nation now is Japan. But why does Japan invade us? Why are we invaded by Japan? Why don't the world's powers come out to interfere? Furthermore, what is the significance of Japan's invasion of us? What impact will the Japanese military's atrocities have on the Far East and the world? If our Northeast were to fall into the hands of the Japanese for a long time, what changes would occur in the world situation? What position would our country fall into? We should have considerable recognition and understanding of this. Only those who know themselves and their enemies can determine victory or defeat. Only those who internally examine the national situation and externally understand the world can devise countermeasures. Therefore, to resist Japan and save the country, one must first know oneself, know Japan, and also know the world. This is the first understanding that the national education sector should have today.</p>
<p>Second, we should recognize students. Students have not been influenced by the old society, and their thoughts and actions are pure, lively, and progressive. The education sector should recognize this point. We should maintain close contact with students at all times and become one with them. We should always provide students with our own life experiences for understanding. More often, we should use the vitality of students to prevent our own decline. We must not pretend to be dignified and self-important. Teachers in class, strangers outside. Students and teachers are as if they do not live in the same era, forming an invisible chasm between the old and the new. Only by recognizing students can we grasp the future of the nation. Only by being close to students can we make their actions more positive and effective. Only by becoming one with students can we increase the efficiency of education. This is the second understanding that the national education sector should have today.</p>
<p>Third, we should recognize the mission of education. The mission of education is to promote society and promote the era, so that society gradually moves onto a rational track, and so that people gradually move closer to a happy paradise. Young students are the driving force for promoting society and the vanguard for creating the era. How to use this driving force, how to lead this vanguard, is the responsibility of the education sector. Therefore, the education sector should never have traditional concepts, should not be complacent, and should not adhere to established paths. We should lead students towards the path of innovation. This is the third thing that the national education sector should recognize today.</p>
<p>The country is in a precarious situation today. From today onwards, if the whole country does not lead the energetic youth with an attitude of no doubt to carry out effective struggles for reform, and still remains timid, adheres to old ways, and hesitates, then the future of the nation will be hopeless. The above three points are something that the entire country should recognize.</p>
<p>Secondly, in this extraordinary period, there should be a curriculum for an extraordinary period. What is the curriculum for the extraordinary period? We believe that all impractical and unnecessary courses should be deleted, and that the most economical time and methods should be used to teach urgent national salvation subjects. The so-called urgent national salvation subjects are not limited to men learning military affairs and women learning nursing. In addition to this, we believe that more attention should be paid to: (1) Increasing the productivity of economic warfare. (2) Increasing the unity of internal harmony and external resistance. (3) Increasing the intellectual power to judge situations. (4) Increasing the productivity of economic warfare. (5) Increasing the resistance to withstand violence. In a word, under this extraordinary situation, students and youths should be educated to be physically sound, intellectually sound, and have sound actions, with a firm will and sustained struggle. If enemy soldiers are approaching the city and the country is breaking apart, but they are still teaching what they used to teach and learning what they used to learn, and if they only think that men learning military affairs and women learning nursing can resist the strong and save the country, the former is impractical and the latter is shortsighted, and neither is true. We hereby offer our humble views as such. In this time of crisis, the education sector should quickly take on the heavy responsibilities it should bear.</p>

<p>Gandhi Plans to Tour Europe After the Round Table Conference Ends</p>
<p>Various Ethnic Groups Compete for Seats in Congress</p>
<p>It Is Definitely Not Something That Can Be Resolved in a Moment</p>
<p>National Daily, Berlin, After the end of the London Round Table Conference, it is heard that Gandhi will tour Europe. His itinerary will probably start from the British capital to Hamburg, Germany, to meet with the so-called "Believers in Nature," Chikomann.

Because Chikomann walked around the world several years ago and became close friends with Gandhi after meeting him in India, Chikomann returned to Europe and devoted himself to the Indian independence movement and promoted a new religion in Europe. The teachings of this religion are quite similar to Taoism.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, Indian Hindus, Muslims, and other small ethnic groups are competing for seats in the Indian Round Table Conference, which is difficult to reconcile, so the Minority Committee will suspend the meeting for a week starting today in order to hold informal talks.

Now, taking advantage of our internal unrest and the severe floods, when the people of the country are trying to save the dying and help the living, they openly send troops to the Eastern Provinces, attacking Liaoning and Jilin. Famous cities and important towns have been captured, with burning, killing, looting, and all kinds of inhumane atrocities. They gain an inch and advance a foot, and their ferocious flames are spreading endlessly. They disregard the world's great disrespect, open up unprecedented tragedies in the international community, despise our national sovereignty, disregard international law, violate public morality, and exterminate humanity. If this can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated? All of our countrymen, as long as there is a breath left, with the same hatred for the enemy, should be of one mind. In addition to having this association vigorously publicize the Japanese people's malicious atrocities based on facts, hoping to awaken the world's sympathy and abandon them with humanity, we also hope that everyone will work together, unite their spirits, go to the national crisis, and save the crisis. The telegram is urgent and overwhelming with indignation. The Beiping Journalists Association bows in gratitude.</p>
<p>Telegram from Xinyang Prefecture</p>
<p>To All Newspaper Offices: Japanese imperialism has occupied our Eastern Provinces without cause, killing our compatriots, and continuing to send troops to prepare to enter the pass. The news of the alert has come, and our hearts and膽俱裂 are broken. At this time, our Chinese nation will die whether we fight or not. Instead of sitting and waiting for death, it is better to concentrate our forces and fight to the death with the Japanese slaves. If we are lucky enough to win, we can wash away the humiliation of the past. If we are unfortunate enough to lose, then it is more glorious to go to justice together than to live and be humiliated. This association is willing to lead hundreds of thousands of people in the whole county to prepare for armed forces and listen to the vanguard's orders. The telegram is extremely悲憤. The Xinyang Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association bows.</p>
<p>Telegram from Wuyuan</p>
<p>To All Newspaper Offices and Compatriots Across the Country: After reading the circular telegram of Deputy Commander Zhang Hao and hearing the news, we were shocked. At a time when our country's internal war and Communist disasters have not yet stopped, and floods in the Huai and Han Rivers continue one after another, when all of our friendly countries are rescuing us, Japan took the opportunity to send Japanese slaves to invade and occupy our three Eastern Provinces, massacre our compatriots, destroy our railways, burn down our arsenals, and occupy our institutions. All kinds of barbarism are infuriating. Such barbaric behavior is actually betraying international law and destroying world peace. The Anti-War Pact should be observed by all, but the Japanese slaves ignore it and take this inappropriate action. All of our compatriots, can they not hate it? Yingdang will read Hao's telegram to each camp, and all officers and soldiers will deeply feel anger and distress. They would rather die to save the country than be slaves to a fallen country. I deeply hope that our compatriots will share this heart. The telegram is a painful cry, and I don't know what to say. Righteous Army Commander Wang Ying respectfully leads all officers and soldiers.</p>
<p>Telegram from Dinghai</p>
<p>Shen Bao transmits to the National Government: This time, Japan added troops to the three Eastern Provinces, killed our soldiers and civilians, and occupied our territory. At Shanhai Pass, the old capital's vassalage erected machine guns horizontally. A large number of troops suddenly came to important coastal ports, forcefully occupying and intimidating, invading Manchuria and Mongolia. This has been verified. Annexing China is another attempt. The demise is imminent. Can the people sit idly by? The Shenjiamen community held a meeting on the day of the fall and resolved to telegraph the government to resist the fierce invaders from abroad, end the disputes within the walls, invite virtuous and talented people, discuss national affairs together, issue a decree of mourning to declare war on Japan, and ask to inform all public organizations across the country, whether in cities or villages, to prepare national salvation savings. It should be regarded as the enthusiasm of the Chinese people and stored at will. At this time when the Japanese slaves are invading the border, the people's spirit is aroused, and the effect will be great. It can be used greatly. Save the people's food and clothing and prepare for war. The economic aspect will not be lacking. During the war, it can last and control the Japanese slaves' lives, and revive the majesty of the yellow race. The courtyard and the hole will be swept away, and our golden pot will be restored. It is a matter of life and death. We must not hesitate. I hope that our government leaders and leaders will quickly set the direction. The island people of the sea swear to be your backing. The Zhejiang Shenjiamen Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association bows.</p>
<p>Telegram from Xiantao Town</p>
<p>To All Newspaper Offices, Overseas Chinese, and Compatriots Across the Country: The Japanese army is barbarous. Under the pretext of the Nakamura disappearance case, they forcefully occupied our Eastern Provinces, bombed and destroyed our arsenals, shot and killed our residents, and robbed our property, disregarding world justice and disrupting East Asian peace. The blood of the Manbao Mountain case has not yet dried, and the tragic killings in the three Eastern Provinces have risen again. If this can be tolerated, the country will be destroyed in no time. Rather than waiting for death with our hands tied, it is better to fight to the death. I still hope that our government, people, and all armed comrades across the country will unite sincerely and go to the national crisis together. All officers and soldiers of this division have always aspired to love the country and swear not to be inferior. With one breath left, we will not hesitate to put on our armor and take up our weapons. We cannot help but be indignant and await orders. Zhang Wanxin, Acting Division Commander of the 34th Army, bows respectfully.</p>
<p>Telegram from Jincheng</p>
<p>To All Newspaper Offices: Our country is unfortunately plagued by frequent disasters. Recently, the Japanese slaves have provoked incidents and been recklessly cruel, and they have actually occupied our cities of Shenyang, Yingkou, Changchun, and Andong on the Hao Day of this month, wantonly burning, looting, and wantonly killing, not only disregarding our country's sovereignty, but also regarding international law as a tattered shoe. Looking at their unbridled behavior, they will surely carry out their long-cherished desire for forceful encroachment. When the bad news came, we were all deeply indignant. Therefore, we established an Anti-Japanese Preparatory Committee on Kan Day, and immediately implemented economic sanctions against Japan in the county, and actively carried out propaganda work, vowing to be the government's backing and to be the vanguard of killing the enemy. I hope that the party-state and the public will quickly stop the internal strife and urgently plan to defend against insults. Human dignity is at stake, and this shame cannot be tolerated again. People's hearts are not dead, and justice will eventually be upheld. At the intersection of life and death, what are the concerns about success or failure? Even if only three households are left in Chu, they can still form a plan to destroy Qin. If there is still a breath left, how can there be no common hatred? I respectfully report this telegram and beg your kind attention. The Anti-Japanese Association Preparatory Committee of Jincheng, Shanxi, respectfully.</p>
<p>Important News: The Course of the Japanese Army's Capture of Changji</p>
<p>From the 19th to the 26th</p>
<p>Changchun Correspondence: The Japanese army heard that Shenyang was occupied on the night of the 18th, and began military operations in Changchun at 2:00 AM the next morning. They then advanced from Changchun to capture Jilin. The details of the continuous course of events are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Japanese Army's Attack on Changchun: At about 10:00 PM on September 18, the Japanese army began attacking Beidaying in Liaoning Province. At about 2:00 AM the next morning, the Changchun Japanese Army Brigade Headquarters received an order from the Kwantung Army Headquarters to mobilize and attack Changchun. They immediately dispatched teams to surround and attack the military camp of the Luguanzi Railway Army, which was guarding the station. Battalion Commander Fu Guanjun of the camp, thinking it was a normal field exercise, went out to investigate and was shot down by the Japanese army. They then began attacking the Eastern Railway Section 6 Police Station, which was adjacent to the camp, and the Eastern Province Special Zone Police Branch. Major Captain Qian of the Japanese army, with the mediation of Sun, the director of the Jilin Province Military and Police Inspection Office stationed there, ordered the troops of the office to surrender their weapons. Director Sun traveled back and forth between the Chinese and Japanese troops to mediate, and at the same time, he telegraphed Xi Qia, the chief of staff of the Jilin Border Defense Army Headquarters, by long-distance telephone for instructions. Xi replied that there was no need to resist. At this time, the soldiers of the camp had suffered many casualties, and because the battalion commander was shot and killed, they were extremely激昻 and refused to surrender their weapons. Some retreated northward. When the attack began, the sound of guns and cannons shook the city. After the army in the camp surrendered their weapons, the Railway Police and Special Zone Police there also surrendered their weapons together. The Japanese army immediately occupied the area and cut off the telephone lines connecting the area with other places. At about 6:00 AM on the same day, the brigade commander of the Japanese army stationed in Changchun led his troops to surround and attack the Nanling military camp, which was about three miles south of Changchun City. The garrison there had a artillery regiment, an infantry regiment, and a baggage battalion. The first to be attacked was the artillery regiment. The regiment headquarters telegraphed Xi Qia by long-distance telephone for instructions. Xi also replied, "Do not resist." The regimental and battalion officers there, because they could not resist and could not sit and wait for death, gradually retreated from each other, and the stored military equipment, food, and barracks were all burned by the Japanese army. The guns, cannons, and horses were also taken away. By about 8:00 PM on this day, the Japanese army began to return to Toudaogou, which was an annexed land of the South Manchuria Railway.</p>
<p>The Japanese Army's Advance from Changchun to Jilin: From the morning of the 19th, after the Japanese army occupied Kuanchengzi Station, the telegraph and telephone lines between Changchun and Harbin were all cut off. At about 8:00 PM on the same day, the important parts of the radio station were dismantled and Japanese soldiers were sent to guard them. On the morning of the 20th, the telegraph bureau of the city was also sealed off, and the long-distance telephone lines of the telegraph bureau were cut off. Only telephone calls within the city were allowed, and Japanese soldiers were sent to guard them separately. The intention was to cut off the connection between Jilin and Changchun. At the same time, armored vehicles also drove to Changchun from the south, and the Japanese military department retrieved the timetable for the Jilin-Changchun train. Japanese nationals in Jilin also came to Changchun one after another. The symbol of their advance to Jilin has been clearly revealed. Xi Qia learned of the above situation on the evening of the 20th and sent Diplomatic Director Shi Luben to question Shizhu Taigoro, the Japanese consul in Jilin. The reply was that there was</p>

<p>Letter to the World: The Shanghai Workers send a telegram to the workers of the world, saying: Fellow workers, you must already be extremely shocked and angered by the recent cruel and violent acts of Japanese imperialism and militarism against the Chinese nation, especially the workers in the three northeastern provinces. On the night of September 18th, the Japanese troops stationed in the three northeastern provinces suddenly attacked Shenyang, Changchun, Yingkou, Andong, and other places without warning, and occupied them completely without resistance. They then began a chaotic massacre of defenseless civilians, regardless of gender or age, raping women, burning cities, and destroying everything. A unit of troops forcibly occupied the Shenyang Arsenal. The Chinese soldiers did not resist, but when they entered, they injured about 30 to 35 workers inside with hand grenades and bayonets. It is still unknown how many Chinese people have been killed in total. Since then, Japan has occupied a portion of Chinese land equal in area to England, blatantly violating the covenants of the League of Nations, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and all treaties that Japan had signed, disregarding world opinion. The League of Nations has also succumbed to the pressure of powerful countries, and governments of various countries are retreating in fear, while Japan openly displays its hypocritical tricks, claiming on the surface that it has withdrawn its troops to within the South Manchurian Railway zone, but in reality, it has not only not withdrawn them, but has actually expanded its control to the three northeastern provinces. All Chinese railways are attacked with airplanes and machine guns, even passenger cars without troops, and they are colluding with bandits to destroy railway tracks and rob trains. Now they are advocating for the independence movement in Manchuria in order to permanently occupy the three northeastern provinces. Furthermore, Japan falsely claims to have special rights in the three northeastern provinces, but in reality, it does not have any special rights. Japan's special rights in the three northeastern provinces and the right to station troops along the South Manchurian Railway are based on the demands of the Twenty-One Demands in 1915, but those demands have never been approved by China's legislative bodies, so they are naturally invalid. Japan's presence in the three northeastern provinces is entirely based on aggressive force. As a result, millions of our compatriots are suffering from terror and massacre. Japan is carrying out violent acts that violate human morality. Solemn international obligations are nothing but empty words on paper in the eyes of Japanese imperialists, just like the empty words guaranteeing the independence of Korea. When it deceived the world and annexed Korea, it threw this empty document into the wastebasket. Japan, having obtained the three northeastern provinces, still wants the entirety of China, to make China a second Korea for their feudal imperialists to exploit and oppress. In the future, they will be able to threaten and intimidate other countries and sweep the world. Fellow workers, can we tolerate this? Are we going to resist them? We Chinese workers hope to promote world friendship and peace, but to achieve this goal, we firmly believe that we must first eliminate Japanese imperialism to avoid future troubles. We vow to achieve this goal at any cost. Please uphold justice and do your best to cooperate with us in this urgent task. We also hope that our Japanese fellow workers will wake up and work together. Whether there is hope for peace in the world depends entirely on the extent to which we defeat Japanese imperialism. If this task cannot be undertaken immediately, we fear that it will cause a world war, even greater and more violent than the last. We Chinese workers vow with the utmost sincerity to save the Chinese nation and all of humanity from the trampling of Japanese imperialism and militarism. Fellow workers, rise up and fight with us!</p>
<p>Telegram to the Central Government: The assembly sends a telegram to the Central Party Headquarters of the National Government, urgently addressed to the Central Party Headquarters of the National Government in Nanjing. The violent Japanese have invaded and are pressing forward, and the survival of the nation is in imminent danger. Our more than 800,000 workers in the city, with grief and indignation, adhere to the belief of learning from the past, preventing future troubles, ceasing internal disputes, and resisting foreign aggression, and are determined to perish with the country with utmost sincerity and loyalty. In addition to sending representatives to Nanjing to present our case in person, we also held a city-wide labor sector anti-Japanese national salvation meeting today and unanimously resolved on the spot with a firm and courageous attitude: (1) The whole country should immediately mobilize to drive the Japanese soldiers out of the country and restore the lost territories; (2) Please ask comrades Wang and Hu, as well as other senior party and national figures, to cooperate fully and take on difficult tasks; (3) The government should issue firearms and order the people of the whole country to organize volunteer armies as a backing for the government; (4) Please ask the government to earnestly provide relief to workers in Japanese factories; (5) A telegram should be sent to workers nationwide, urging them to unite and work hard to resist Japan, and other important matters. Our humble public opinion is truly essential for saving the nation from destruction. If the entire country can implement this, then in the near future, we will surely be able to overcome the great national crisis. Gentlemen of the Central Government, bearing the heavy responsibility of the Party and the country, how can you be willing to be traitors to the nation? Act promptly and decisively, without hesitation. Your merits and sins for thousands of years depend on your deep consideration and efforts. The Shanghai City Labor Sector Anti-Japanese National Salvation Congress bows in respect, winter.</p>
<p>Telegram to the Guangdong Faction: This association sends a telegram to Mr. Wang, Gu, Sun, and Chen in Guangzhou, urgent. Addressed to Mr. Wang Jingwei, Gu Xiangqin, Sun Zhesheng, and Chen Bonan in Guangzhou. Our country will not perish on the day of the Manchu Qing imperial system, but will perish at the time of revolutionary modernization. It will not be controlled by the powerful countries of Europe and America, but will be subjugated by the eastern neighbors of the three islands. What shame and pain is greater than this? Gentlemen, with the determination to serve the country, at this moment when the powerful enemy is driving straight in and the country's demise is imminent, how can you bear to each claim supremacy and forget the great righteousness of the country? Alas, the voices of peace are rife on the roads, but empty thunder without rain, suspicion and fear are inexplicable. Thinking of your past, there is absolutely nothing that the people cannot understand, and at this time, what all our citizens expect from you is both urgent and sincere. Gentlemen, saving the country and establishing merit is a once-in-a-millennium opportunity. We pray that you will make a decisive decision, abandon past grievances, resolutely come to Shanghai, gather openly, and jointly seek solutions to mutually support the plan to save the country. The time is critical, and it will be fleeting. The entire congress of our more than 800,000 workers represents the people of the whole country, looking south and hoping to resolve the national crisis. We can only plan quickly. The Shanghai City Labor Sector Anti-Japanese National Salvation Congress bows in respect, winter.</p>

Second Declaration of the Journalism Labor Union</p>
<p>To all oppressed people of China: Japanese imperialism has occupied our three northeastern provinces by force, massacred thousands of civilians, destroyed the entire social foundation of the north, deprived us of our national sovereignty and seized our rights. The terrible news has been spreading for nearly half a month. In these two weeks, the problem has not only not been solved at all, but the situation in all aspects has made it very clear and certain that the only way to solve the problem is for our people across the country to unite and fight Japanese imperialists to the death. Japanese imperialists are still actively attacking us, and the crisis of national subjugation is imminent. How is Japanese imperialism invading us, and how did it pre-arrange our three northeastern provinces? This is a question worthy of our great attention, and as long as we carefully review the situation before and after the incident, we can understand. For more than ten years, who doesn't know that the three northeastern provinces are a den of pro-Japanese warlords and bureaucrats. Although those pro-Japanese warlords and bureaucrats are Chinese on the surface, officials of China, and subordinates under the rule of the Chinese government, in reality, they are all lackeys of Japan, filial sons and grandsons of Japan. Therefore, for more than ten years, the three northeastern provinces have only been considered Chinese territory in name, but in essence, they have long become Japanese colonies. All political and economic power in the three northeastern provinces is entirely in the hands of the Japanese. However, the greedy and insatiable Japanese still feel that it is not enough, and they must thoroughly plunder the land and make it their formal territory in order to be happy. This dispatch of troops is the beginning of plunder. However, clever and cunning Japanese, in order to deceive the public, will force several Chinese traitors to organize an independent country after directly dispatching troops, blatantly seceding from China and throwing themselves into the arms of the Japanese. This is the old method of dealing with Korea, so our three northeastern provinces will become the second Korea. The people of the three provinces will soon become slaves of a conquered nation. Now, news from all sides is confirming the possibility and reliability of this fact, so what else is there to question? Alas, our China is still in a state of confusion and unconsciousness at this most critical moment, and it wants peace, non-resistance, and seeks the help of the League of Nations. What is this? Alas, the omen of national subjugation! Peace, peace, who doesn't like this word? However, the peace that is sought in this way is the peace of national subjugation, the peace of extinction, not the peace that is beneficial to the people. China's peace has long been destroyed by itself for decades, so what peace is there to speak of? Our people take out so much of their blood and sweat every year to support officials and troops, but as a result, when foreign aggression comes, they don't know to rise up and resist, but just weakly beg for forgiveness from the robbers and tell their own people to want peace and should not resist, and give up thousands of miles of territory to the dwarves in peace. Thinking about it, it is so painful! As for the League of Nations, it is even more unreliable. What is the League of Nations? To put it plainly, the League of Nations is an organization of imperialists united to oppress weak nations. The League of Nations oppresses weak nations, and is the executioner of weak nations. Where can it stand up for justice for us? The facts of the past few days have told us that it not only does not interfere with Japan's violence, but is tacitly allowing Japan to continue its violence and carve up the three northeastern provinces. Once the three northeastern provinces formally become Japanese territory, they will follow up and attack China, and divide China from the standpoint of "equal benefits." Therefore, the League of Nations is definitely not our savior, but our enemy! However, there are still many Chinese with noble words who are fantasizing about the help of the League of Nations, which is really shameful and ridiculous. The enemy has already raised the butcher knife and is chasing us closely. We don't know to escape, don't know to resist, just pray to the gods and worship Buddha, and make those unpromising stupid acts. How painful it is! Now the situation in all aspects is so dangerous and urgent. If we want to save China, save ourselves, and not be slaves of a conquered nation, we can only rely on our own courage to automatically unite and fight against enemies at home and abroad. Now, at this critical juncture of national subjugation and extinction, there is no second way to survive except self-rescue. Japan will not be merciful, will not wake up, will not "lay down the butcher knife and become a Buddha on the spot." The League of Nations will not uphold justice and help us. The government is so weak and traitorous, and in this state, only we, the people, can rise up and fight Japan without compromise. Peace has long ceased to exist, and non-resistance is a good way to destroy the country. Tranquility is just equal to being calmly slaughtered by Japanese imperialists. Compatriots who are unwilling to be slaves of a conquered nation, rise up, bravely, thoroughly, and without compromise: (1) Automatically arm yourselves and declare war on Japan; (2) Drive Japanese troops out of the country; (3) Do not work with Japanese people, do not provide Japanese residents with food and all items; (4) Mercilessly kill treacherous merchants who collude with Japanese people; (5) Recover all privileges of Japanese imperialism in China; (6) Confiscate all property of Japanese imperialists in China as compensation for the losses in the three northeastern provinces; (7) Oppose all internal disputes and unite against foreign enemies; (8) Oppose the policy of non-resistance and tranquility that will destroy the country; (9) Oppose secret diplomacy and the signing of treaties that cede rights and humiliate the country; (10) Down with imperialism; (11) Abolish all unequal treaties.</p>
<p>May the People of the Country Pay Attention to the Area of the Three Northeastern Provinces</p>
<p>Greater Than the Seven Coastal Provinces</p>
<p>According to a geographer yesterday, the total area of the three provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang is 3,533,000 square miles, which is larger than the seven coastal provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, and Guangxi. The total area of the seven provinces is only 3,447,500 square miles, which is 84,700 square miles less in comparison. Therefore, the people of the country should quickly wake up and understand that not an inch of national territory can be lost, let alone the great Northeastern Provinces.</p>

The chairman finished the report, shouted slogans at the end, and the meeting adjourned at dusk.</p>
<p>Proposals Passed: (1) Sending a telegram to the central government requesting severance of diplomatic relations with Japan; (2) Sending a telegram to the central government requesting the dispatch of troops to declare war on Japan on a specific date; (3) Sending a telegram to the central government requesting the Ministry of Education to order all schools above middle school level nationwide to strictly implement military training; (4) Sending a telegram to the central government requesting the appointment of Chiang Kai-shek as the commander-in-chief to fight Japan; (5) Sending a telegram to the central government requesting Chiang Kai-shek to preside over military affairs, Wang Jingwei to preside over party affairs, and Hu Hanmin to preside over political affairs; (6) Petitioning the central government to promptly order the Ministry of Industry to raise funds to establish state-owned factories to accommodate Chinese workers in Japanese factories and thoroughly implement economic severance with Japan.</p>

Because the violent Japanese are invading more and more urgently, and the country's demise is imminent, it is necessary to gather the elites of the whole country to jointly plan the major affairs of the party and the country. In the past, only personal political differences caused fragmentation, and now the trend of public opinion and the repeated declarations of the country by all of you also said that unity and resistance to foreign aggression are necessary. Therefore, we urge you to immediately abandon past grievances, gather together, and each display your abilities to manage the party, government, and military in order to save China from danger and resist foreign aggression, and then achieve world harmony and eliminate obstacles. We are eagerly looking forward to your acceptance. Shanghai County Third District Anti-Japanese National Salvation People's Congress bows in respect, winter. Quick Mail Telegram from the Fifth Division Party Headquarters.</p>
<p>All newspapers are requested to forward this to all compatriots across the country: Japanese capitalist imperialists, in order to reliably and abundantly supply all raw materials to prepare for the impending Second World War, and to save their incurable economic panic that has lasted for several years to maintain their domestic politics that are on the verge of collapse, decided to make their Manchuria-Mongolia policy, which they have been planning since the Meiji era, suddenly become white-hot, betray the non-war pact, break international precedents, and blatantly, under various pretexts, use extremely rapid and brutal means to send troops to occupy our three northeastern provinces. After the incident, they even fabricated facts, covered up the truth, rejected the mediation of the League of Nations, and continued to increase troops to successively occupy famous cities, attempting to permanently occupy the eastern provinces. It is because Japanese imperialism has now decisively re-enacted the scene of robbing Korea. Our compatriots across the country, facing this serious invasion, must not rely solely on the assistance that cannot be obtained by third parties, but can only hope to survive. Only by exerting all our own strength, uniting as one, and meeting head-on can we open up a path to survival. And the development of this path to survival cannot be accomplished without sweeping away all Japanese forces in China. All armed comrades of this division, filled with grief and indignation, are waiting with swords and pillows to take the lead for the country and stand on the front line to fight the Japanese bandits to the death. We earnestly hope that our compatriots across the country will rise up in time, closely organize and strengthen their forces, make long-term plans, and prepare to go to the national crisis with a determination to die. The survival of the country depends on this one action. We are willing to make the final great determination together.

<p>Students Studying in Japan and Others Are Returning Home One After Another</p>
<p>Students Studying in Japan Return Home: After the violent Japanese forcibly occupied our eastern provinces, students studying in Japan felt the pain of the loss of national territory and were particularly embarrassed to be within the sphere of influence of the violent Japanese.

A large number of students are still waiting for travel expenses, and will set off to return home after the money is remitted.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Return Home After Being Insulted: Most of the overseas Chinese in Japan are engaged in hairdressing, kimono, and cooking. Since the Japanese soldiers occupied Liaoning and Jilin on the 19th of last month, they have suffered various insults. Therefore, the overseas Chinese have left Japan and returned home one after another. The Ikoma Maru arrived in Shanghai yesterday, carrying 129 people including Fu Zhenghua. The Kasagi Maru arrived in Shanghai, and there were another 43 people including Xie Wenhua and Gu Qiyun. The Rokko Maru and Mikasa Maru arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, with a total of more than 210 people including Chen Qianyuan, Chen Huajun, and Bao Dequan, mostly from Zhejiang and Fujian provinces.

First, Yan reported on the various situations when leaving Shenyang, which were roughly the same as those reported in the newspapers.

He hoped that in the future, the people of the country would pay attention to all the actions of the Japanese army in occupying the eastern provinces at any time and report them to the international community and the League of Nations. On the other hand, they should also find ways to transmit information quickly in order to respond at any time. Then, Mr. Nie reported on the outrage of the Japanese expatriates towards the atrocities of the Japanese army, and the actions of the academic circles in Tokyo, uniting as one to jointly go to the national crisis.

<h3>Preparations for Beijing-Guangdong Peace Negotiations Move to Shanghai for Resumption</h3>
<p>Chiang Kai-shek Orders Chen Mingshu and Others Back to Nanjing</p>
<p>Guangdong Faction Sends Official Representatives to Shanghai</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Nanjing-Guangdong peace talks resumed at 3 p.m. on the 1st. The Guangdong side presented six concrete conditions. The Nanjing representatives found them satisfactory but still needed to telegraph Chiang Kai-shek for instructions. The clause regarding the release of Hu Hanmin and Li Jishen was changed to "inviting Hu and others to Shanghai to participate in a unified conference." Chen Mingshu received a reply telegram from Chiang yesterday, ordering Chen and others to return to Nanjing immediately. Therefore, the peace conference will be moved to Shanghai. Chiang's telegram did not mention any intention to step down. Discussions will continue at 3 p.m. on the 2nd. The Guangdong National Government decided at its meeting on the 2nd to send official representatives to Shanghai to participate in the peace talks. The number of representatives is set at three. (Special dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) News from the Guangdong National Government: Many telegrams calling for peace have been received here. A peace agreement is expected to be negotiated within five days. (Special dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Cai Yuanpei and Zhang Ji visited Zhu Zhaoxin on the 2nd to discuss Northeast diplomacy. (Special dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce representative Wang Hanliang and others petitioned the Guangdong National Government for a cessation of hostilities and a united front against external threats on the 1st. They were received by Tang Shaoyi, Wang Jingwei, and Gu Yingfen, and the outcome was satisfactory. Wang and others returned to Shanghai on the 2nd. (Special dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the Beijing-Guangdong peace issue, the six points reported by the Hong Kong telegram were described here as Cai Yuanpei's telegrams, which did not list conditions. Military and financial matters are particularly intertwined. Regarding the selection of the Minister of Finance, at least the consent of the highest military officer is required. Furthermore, the party operates on a collegial system, and it cannot be said that it should be handed over to someone to preside over. As for administrative issues, those willing to step aside are doing so. Moreover, Hu Hanmin has been able to receive guests freely starting today. He also stated that Wang Zhengting's mishandling of diplomacy was wrong, and the public opposition was justified. As for the unified conference, the name is still under consideration and has not been definitively decided, but the location is in Shanghai, and both Beijing and Guangdong have fully agreed. Tang Shaoyi and others will travel to Shanghai soon. Liu Luyin, representing Guangzhou, arrived in Shanghai yesterday. (Special dispatch, 2nd)</p>

<h3>Lindbergh and His Wife Encountered Danger in Airplane in Hankou</h3>
<p>All Three Fell into the Water but Were Rescued</p>
<p>(Hankou) This morning, Mr. and Mrs. Lindbergh planned to accompany Jin, a medical officer from the National Government's Health Department, in an airplane to survey Dongting Lake. The plane was unloaded from the British aircraft carrier HMS Hermes onto the water. Lindbergh himself was piloting the plane. As the plane took off, one wing suddenly tilted downward, and the plane flipped over in an instant. All three fell into the water. Lindbergh helped his wife with all his strength. A lifeboat from HMS Hermes happened to be on the ship's side and rushed to rescue the three, taking them aboard HMS Hermes. Fortunately, all three were unharmed. Although Mrs. Lindbergh was frightened, she remained calm. The overturned plane was then towed onto HMS Hermes. Upon inspection, it was found that one wing and other parts were damaged, but they could not be repaired in Hankou. It was decided that HMS Hermes would carry the plane to Shanghai for repairs on Saturday evening. Mr. and Mrs. Lindbergh will also travel east on the same ship. (Reuters dispatch, 2nd)</p>

<h3>Hefei</h3>
<p>Changlinhe Town Entirely Robbed: Changlinhe, a major town in the southeast along Chaohu Lake, is a fish-producing area with thriving commerce. Lake bandits have long coveted it, but they have been unable to invade because the town's merchants' corps and water and land police have maintained strict defenses. However, on the morning of the 25th, due to the Mid-Autumn Festival, the city was crowded, and the corps police were busy with the holiday, with lax defenses. Suddenly, fourteen large boats, fully loaded with two or three hundred water bandits, swarmed ashore, surrounded the town, and stormed in through the north and south gates. The garrisoned corps police were caught off guard and retreated under the leadership of Corps Commander Gong Ruiting. The bandits then arbitrarily searched and robbed every household along the streets. Hundreds of large and small businesses in the town were spared. Before leaving, they also kidnapped sixty or seventy wealthy merchants and fled to the center of the lake. The losses are estimated at over 100,000 yuan. The businesses of Liu Renhe and Yude Tai, among others, suffered the greatest losses. Today (the 26th), people from the town flocked to the city to report the case. The county government urgently dispatched a large detachment of self-defense corps to pursue and suppress the bandits. Furthermore, Sanhe Town, a famous rice-producing area ninety li south, is also currently under siege by several hundred bandits. On the 25th, the new County Magistrate Zhu Tingliao, along with the Self-Defense Corps Commander Yuan Doushu, led a team to suppress them.</p>

<h3>How Should the Jiangsu Provincial Middle School Principals' Conference</h3>
<p>Lead Students to Save the Nation?</p>
<p>Ten Measures Decided</p>
<p>(Zhenjiang Correspondence) The principals of Jiangsu provincial middle schools gathered in Zhenjiang Middle School on September 30th. Over ten people attended, including Principal Hu from Suzhou Middle School, Principal Zheng from Shanghai Middle School, Principal Gu from Taizhou Middle School, Principal Zhang from Nantong Middle School, Principal Zhou from Yangzhou Middle School, Principal Ren from Zhenjiang Middle School, Principal Chen from Suzhou Women's Middle School, and Principal Jiang from Songjiang Women's Middle School. They resolved nine proposals, the most important being two: (1) How to lead students to overcome national difficulties together. Ten measures were decided: (1) Teachers and students of each school should jointly form an anti-Japanese national salvation association to actively work; (2) Each subject should temporarily incorporate anti-Japanese national salvation teaching materials within a possible scope to meet the current extraordinary needs; (3) Teachers and students in various primary and secondary schools should jointly swear to always use pure domestic products and economically sever ties with Japan, extending from teachers and students themselves to their families and then gradually to society; (4) All faculty and staff of each school should wear domestic-made uniforms from now on to boost morale; (5) Principals Hu and Zheng should be nominated as representatives to request the Directorate-General of Military Training to issue militia forces to each school, with usable guns and ammunition for practice; (6) Each school should request the local garrison to send military officers to the school to assist in training, or lead militia schools to the garrison's camp to temporarily borrow guns for practice; (7) All girls' schools should increase nursing courses and organize nursing teams; (8) A letter should be sent to the Directorate-General of Military Training requesting that military instructors with excellent performance in each school not be transferred to other positions in order to deepen their training (9) Each school should pay close attention to this series of national salvation work, striving to achieve practical and lasting results, and avoid temporary extravagance and recklessness, or allowing enthusiasm to wane after the situation has passed (10) A telegram should be sent to the National Government to quickly decide on a strategy for armed self-defense and to the Guangdong side to jointly resist foreign aggression in order to alleviate the national crisis (2) How to promote donations for disaster relief. Three items were resolved: (1) Upon investigation, primary school teachers in various disaster areas are also affected by disasters, but because they are civil servants, they often cannot receive relief. This is extremely difficult, and the Department of Education should be urgently requested to allocate all the funds deducted from the salaries of faculty and staff of each school to specifically provide relief to primary school teachers affected by disasters. At the same time, contact public and private universities to do the same. As for the method of providing on-site relief, the Department of Education should convene the heads of education bureaus and the principals of each school in each county to coordinate it. (2) In addition to the stipulated salary deduction to help relief efforts, each school will raise more donations to provide emergency relief, the more the better. (3) The total amount of donations from each school must be reported for comparison and summarized and announced.</p>

In addition to the refereeing committee assigning as many as possible, if anyone is willing to serve as a referee, please contact Mr. Li Nuoshi, the secretary of the refereeing committee, at the Shanghai Waterworks Company on Jiangxi Road. For the matches today and tomorrow, the home team must request a referee in advance to prevent a situation where no one is available at the last minute.</p>

<h3>Malayan Overseas Chinese Tennis Team Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Four Track and Field Athletes Came Together</p>
<p>Female Athletes Temporarily Stayed in Hong Kong to Transfer to Guangdong</p>
<p>丨Led Back to Their Motherland by Wu Zaixing, Wang Shengzhi, etc.丨</p>
<p>For the purpose of promoting sports in various places in British Malaya, the All-Malaya Sports Games were held in April this year. Before the games, each port, such as Penang, Malacca, Kuala Lumpur, Seremban, Muar, Johor, Singapore, and Ipoh, first held its local joint sports meeting and then sent athletes to the games to participate. After the closing of the games, the athletes were selected and an overseas Chinese team was organized to represent Malaya in the National Games. Unfortunately, the National Games were postponed.</p>

<p>(From left to right) Wang Shengzhi (Secretary), Zhong Zhilin, Yang Lunzhang, Lin Wangsu, Feng Jiekun</p>
<p>The athletes, originally more than 70 people, were recalled midway in Hong Kong. However, the track and field athletes and Lin Wangsu, the all-Malaya tennis champion, and others, were very interested in visiting the motherland. Therefore, Wu Zaixing, a prominent figure in the sports world, and Wang Shengzhi, the secretary of the team, were responsible for leading the team. They took the Ardu to Shanghai from Hong Kong. More than 20 female athletes originally came on the same boat but changed their plans temporarily. The plan to stay in Hong Kong to transfer to Guangdong for competition and visit Shanghai was abandoned. Yesterday, Yang Yufen, secretary of Jinan University, Chen Zhang'e, director of physical education, and student representative Hao Chunde, and others went to the pier to welcome them. Qiu Feihai, a national tennis player, was also among those welcoming them and planned to shake hands with his old friend Lin Wangsu, but he could not wait long and left the pier first. The ship arrived at exactly 2:00 p.m., and passengers did not disembark until 4:00 p.m. This two-hour wait was relieved by meeting Lin Aimin, an overseas Chinese from Singapore, who talked about the state of sports among overseas Chinese. Mr. Lin was originally taking care of the athletes returning home, but the National Games were suspended due to an incident, and the enthusiasm of the overseas Chinese could only be given to the East River. This time, there are a total of ten overseas Chinese athletes, leaders, and secretaries who plan to stay temporarily at Jinan University and then travel to West Lake, Nanjing, Suzhou, and Beijing. Lin Wangsu and others in Shanghai may participate in disaster relief matches at the invitation of the Association for the Advancement of Cooperation. The four track and field athletes who have arrived will be joined by Deng Yuehan and Cai Wenli, who will come to Shanghai on the 6th along with the soccer team, and then play friendly matches against various universities in Shanghai. The names and achievements of the various staff and athletes who came to Shanghai are introduced below:</p>
<p>Wu Zaixing, leader, is the director of the Regulations Section of the Organizing Committee of the Association and has made great contributions to the Association. Mr. Wu is proficient in basketball and good at sprinting. He represented China at the 8th Far Eastern Games in 1927. He graduated from the Department of Economics of Xiamen University in Fujian. This time, he plans to enter the graduate school of Tsinghua University in Beijing to specialize in economics.</p>
<p>Wang Shengzhi, graduated from the Department of Political Science of Peking University (now renamed Beiping University), is the director of the Secretariat Section of the Organizing Committee and the reporter of the Malaysian-Chinese Sports Games. He is fluent in Chinese and skilled in communication. He is a versatile talent among overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>Lin Wangsu won the title of All-Malaya Tennis Champion in 1931.</p>
<p>Yang Lunzhang is the runner-up in this year's All-Malaya Tennis Championship and also won the Johor International Tennis Championship this year, winning glory for the Chinese community in the area.</p>
<p>Zhong Zhilin is the central figure among the full backs of the All-Malaya football team and is also proficient in tennis.</p>
<p>Feng Jiekun is young and ambitious and has a lively physique. He is a rising tennis star and made a shocking performance in Annam last year, making him a formidable new force.</p>
<p>Fu Jinsheng, nicknamed "Flying General," set a new record of 10 seconds in the 100-yard dash at the All-Malaya World Games in August and finished second in the 220-yard dash by a hair, with a time of 22.1 seconds, which can also be said to be amazing.</p>
<p>Deng Yuehan is a mainstay of the team, good at hurdles and skilled in jumping. He won the All-Malaya Individual Championship in April this year (arriving in Shanghai on the 6th).</p>
<p>Liang Junhua specializes in hurdles with a score of under 17 seconds and is also good at sprinting and long jump.</p>
<p>Pan Nanshun is a triathlon expert who won the first place in javelin and shot put at the National Games last year.</p>
<p>He Yishi is good at long-distance running and is a rising star.</p>
<h3>Malayan Football Team</h3>
<p>One Win and One Loss in Hong Kong</p>
<p>Lost the First Game 1-4</p>
<p>Won the Second Game 3-1</p>
<p>(Hong Kong Correspondent) The Malayan Overseas Chinese Football Team returned to China. It was originally planned to participate in the National Games and stop by Hong Kong to play interport matches. The team played twice in Hong Kong. The first time, the Hong Kong China Team won, with a score of 4-1. The second time, the Malayan Team won, with a score of 3-1. Hong Kong has a very good impression of the Malayan team's skills. The team is scheduled to come to Shanghai on the 6th and stay at the new Chinese YMCA premises in the French Concession. It is expected that when they meet the Shanghai China Team in the future, there will be an unprecedented and fierce battle.</p>

<p>Baoshan Road Tragedy</p>
<p>Party, Military, and Government Joint Investigation Underway</p>
<p>Public Organizations Request Punishment for You Bolu</p>
<p>Wang Zhijing Succeeds as Fifth District Chief</p>
<p>Chen Xizeng Voluntarily Requests Punishment Yesterday</p>
<p>The Fifth District Public Security Bureau police of Zhabei Baoshan Road had a misunderstanding with the public the night before last. Police officers opened fire, killing two civilians and seriously injuring five. The details were recorded in yesterday's newspaper. What this newspaper heard yesterday is compiled and narrated below:</p>
<p>Zhang Qun's Remarks: Regarding the incident of Fifth District Public Security Bureau police officers shooting civilians for stopping soldiers from posting slogans at a sentry post, a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency went to the municipal government yesterday to visit Mayor Zhang Qun and inquire about the truth of the matter and subsequent measures. I was honored to receive a detailed reply, as follows. According to the conversation, the truth of the incident can be divided into two points. The first point was that a dispute arose between soldiers posting slogans and police officers, which attracted the attention of the public. However, after the district chief explained, the matter was resolved. However, the audience gathered more and more, and then the second problem arose. After the matter of posting slogans was resolved, although the crowd gradually dispersed, some busybodies still inquired about the truth from the residents on the left and right. That morning, a Japanese merchant went to the Fifth District Public Security Bureau to negotiate the return of wheat bran detained by the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association on Suzhou Creek Road. The Japanese had negotiated this matter several times, but it had not been returned. Therefore, those in the surrounding shops who witnessed the Japanese entering and leaving told the crowd and speculated, mistakenly believing that the Fifth District's ban on posting slogans was colluding with the Japanese. At this critical moment of national crisis, patriotic actions are naturally shared by everyone. Therefore, the general public gathered again and went to the Fifth District police station to question them, and the shouts were thunderous. The police and security team came out to suppress them, and improper measures caused this unfortunate incident. I deeply regret it. However, those present at the time included Mr. Yang Youren from the labor community and members of the Sixth District Party Department of the Party Department, which was nearby. Both sides witnessed the course of events and came forward to mediate and explain. Therefore, when dealing with it according to law in the future, they can also serve as third-party witnesses. After this incident occurred, the municipal government immediately dismissed You Bolu, the Fifth District Chief, from his post for investigation, and sent Section Chief Qi Tiecheng, Public Security Bureau Chief Chen Xizeng, Mr. Wu Kaixian from the Municipal Party Department, and Mr. Hou Dachun from the labor union to rush to the scene of the incident to investigate the facts. The local court was notified to send personnel to examine the two deceased, and the five injured were sent to the hospital. On the one hand, the families of the deceased were sought to claim the bodies, but no one had claimed them by this afternoon. Since this incident was caused by the military police and the Sixth District Party Department was also present, it was decided that the party, government, and military would jointly investigate the matter thoroughly. After the investigation is confirmed and the three parties report together, if the fault lies with the Fifth District, whether it is excessive defense or improper measures, it will definitely be dealt with severely according to law to punish dereliction of duty and apologize to the citizens. In short, I will absolutely handle this matter openly and impartially. The position of the Fifth District Chief will be temporarily maintained by transferring staff from other districts, and a formal appointment will be made soon. (Note by the reporter: The Public Security Bureau has transferred Wang Zhijing, the Second District Chief, to succeed him.)</p>
<p>Corpse Examination: After the municipal government learned of this incident the night before last, it immediately notified President Shen of the local court and Chief Prosecutor Liu by telephone, requesting them to handle the matter. Prosecutor Yang Wenjun was immediately appointed to lead Police Chief Xu Jinqing, Police Officer Chen Xihui, and supervising police officers Xu Guoguang, Zou Zhendong, Li Jiajun, Wang Xiqing, Zhang Chunsen, Yu Shaoshan, and Hu Xianglin to rush to the front of the Fifth District Police Station at midnight to conduct an inspection and suppress the riot. Inspector Shen found in front of the police station a person wearing a gray serge gown. The injured part was from the left cheek, out of the right temple. However, a pistol was inserted into the waistband. On the opposite side, there was a man wearing a blue short shirt and pants, barefoot. The bullet entered from the back and exited the front chest. Both corpses were in their twenties. The judge then ordered the collection of the bodies. When asked about the guns, Director You of the district claimed that the police officers had found two bullet casings, which they thought were fired by the deceased. The prosecutor then inspected the gun, the number of which was 5589, with three bullets inside, but not loaded. According to the usage of pistols, anyone who has fired a bullet will definitely load one later. Now, the gun barrel is covered with rust, and the gun is inserted in the waistband, which is very puzzling. Therefore, it was ordered that the pistol be filed for future summons of all relevant persons for thorough investigation and handling.</p>
<p>Family Members Petition: The two male corpses who were shot and killed on the spot the night before last, the younger of the two, were claimed by his biological mother yesterday morning. She claimed that she is currently a maid in a mansion. The deceased was her son, Shen Wanlin, 18 years old, from Shaoxing. He used to be an apprentice in the Dali Clothing Factory near Baoshan Road. He went out to play after work that night and suddenly this disaster occurred. She cried bitterly, and the situation was extremely tragic. At about 10 a.m. yesterday, she, along with the general public, went to the Sixth District Party Department to petition. The members of the Party Department, Yang Youren, etc., persuaded her, expressing that the Party Department stood on the position of urging the government to uphold justice impartially. In addition to the fact that member Yang Youren had personally reported the incident to Mayor Zhang Qun, Standing Committee members of the Municipal Party Department Pan Gongzhan, Wu Kaixian, and member Chen Xizeng, he has now submitted a request to the Municipal Party Department to punish the murderers. As for the other corpse, no one has claimed it yet.</p>
<p>Joint Investigation: This case has been jointly investigated by representatives from the party, government, and military. The representative of the Party Department is Wu Kaixian, the representative of the municipal government is Yu Hongjun, and the representative of the garrison command is Jiang Yi. Yesterday morning at 9 a.m., they went to the Fifth District Police Station to conduct an on-site inspection and personally inquired about the situation from the patrol officers and police officers at the time, and whether it was necessary to open fire. At 4 p.m., they gathered the civilian witnesses who were at the scene at the Sixth District Party Department and questioned the shopkeepers in the vicinity in detail. Regarding the claim of the Public Security Bureau that a gunshot was first heard among the crowd, all witnesses unanimously denied it. As for a pistol found on the corpse, someone also testified that after the special curfew was imposed in the Baoshan Road area, there were no pedestrians on the road. Someone on the upper floor personally saw plainclothes police officers groping under the mat shed covering the corpse for a long time. It was not until about 6 p'clock that they dispersed. According to Yu Hongjun to this newspaper reporter, the joint investigation has not yet been completed (it is scheduled to continue tomorrow, which is today). It is not yet time to publish it. Everything will be handled publicly in the future.</p>
<p>Voluntary Request for Punishment: Chen Xizeng, Chief of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, submitted a document to Mayor Zhang yesterday, stating, "Reporting matter: It is hereby reported that at 8 p.m. on the 1st of this month, a conflict occurred between residents near Baoshan Road in the Fifth District and the district police, resulting in a shooting that caused death. The details of the incident have been reported in person and reported in the newspaper. This case has been ordered to be suspended from duty pending investigation. As the director in charge, although the situation was urgent this time, it was also due to the lack of supervision and exhortation on weekdays. Therefore, I should sincerely request strict punishment to show a warning. In addition to strictly ordering my subordinates to deal with it carefully, I should prepare a document and submit it. This paper is for your convenience. Sincerely presented to Mayor Zhang."</p>
<p>Reporting by Delegation: Feng Xiancheng, Standing Committee Member of the Sixth District Party Department, and Yang Youren, Propaganda Committee Member, told reporters yesterday that they had reported the witnessed circumstances to the Municipal Party Department, stating, "At about 6 p.m. yesterday, two post office mail carriers came to the district headquarters to report that the Fifth District Public Security Bureau police officers had a conflict because they did not allow soldiers from the Fifth Team of the Railway Artillery Brigade to post anti-Japanese slogans, and took them to the district headquarters. At that time, hundreds of people followed behind and gathered at the door of the Fifth District, unwilling to disperse. Please go to investigate," etc. At that time, the District Party Department was preparing to convene a meeting to organize an anti-Japanese national salvation dare-to-die team. Xiancheng, Youren, and comrade Wen Ren'an went to the Fifth District to meet Guo Chenggai, a member of the district. According to him, the police officers were planning to deal with the matter according to law and could be dismissed tomorrow. The soldiers of the company were also satisfied when they heard this, so they stood on the top of the car at the door of the Public Security Bureau and reported to the audience and left. Some of the people had already dispersed, and another part chased and gathered in the Party Department in this district, waiting for the results of the negotiations. Later, Fu Jisan, a soldier on duty in the artillery team, and Yang Youren did their best to persuade them, and they also dispersed one after another. Xiancheng and others thought that the matter was over, so they planned to hold a meeting. Unexpectedly, at about 8 p.m., more than ten people came to report, stating that more than a thousand people were still gathered at the entrance of the Fifth District Public Security Bureau, unwilling to leave. Xiancheng, Youren, etc. went to the police station again. Those who went with them at that time included Zhu Jiujiu, Ge Yongqing, Li Qiuxin, Shi Tifen, Zhang Wenkui, and other comrades. After inquiring about the situation, they learned that three Japanese had been staying in the police station for an hour three hours before the conflict between the military and police. They asked the district chief to explain the ins and outs. Then Xiancheng introduced You Bolu to the crowd and gave a speech to explain the ins and outs. Xiancheng and Youren continued to explain to the crowd and asked everyone to disperse. At that time, a bus (from North Station to Jiangwan) also stopped at the door to listen. Shi Tifen, the chief auditor of the company, urgently ordered it to leave, and the people also ordered it to leave, but the machine had stopped and could not start. Later, for some reason, there was a conflict with the people. The driver of the car, Wu Decai, was beaten by the crowd and rescued by Shi Tifen to the Fifth District Police Station. At that time, Youren saw that the people were not dispersing, so he inserted himself into the crowd and persuaded them to disperse. Xiancheng then ordered Xu Ziqing, the traffic officer of the district headquarters, to go to the Fifth Company quickly, planning to ask the soldiers of the company to come and explain again and persuade everyone to disperse, so as to maintain order. He also sent Youren's hat in the hand of the traffic officer to Youren, and he was also in the middle of the crowd. At this time, You Bolu, the director of the Fifth District Police Station, ordered to open fire. The first order was issued, but the police did not open fire. The director jumped and shouted to open fire, so they fired live ammunition (Li Qiuxin and Zhang Wenkui saw it personally and can testify), firing at the crowd in a sweeping manner for about twenty shots. There were a large number of people at that time. Youren was squeezed towards the entrance of Beilian Zhili, and Xiancheng was also squeezed into the hardware store opposite the police station. After the gunshots, one person was killed about two or three feet away from where Xiancheng and Youren were located, and one person was killed on the opposite side. After Cheng saw it, he went to the police station, intending to question You Bolu, but You Bolu said, "You are being used by others, I will take care of things myself," etc., and went straight to the side. Xiancheng thought that the district chief was unreasonable, so he reported directly to the superior.</p>
<h3>The Credit of the China Industrial Bank is Evident</h3>
<p>Daily Rumors Mislead Citizens</p>
<p>The Bank Extends the Cashing Time</p>
<p>The Run on the Bank Gradually Subsided Last Night</p>
<p>The China Industrial Bank and its branches in this city experienced a run on the bank yesterday. The reason was that the Shanghai Nichinichi Shimbun, a Japanese newspaper, published inaccurate news yesterday. The holders of the tickets did not know the truth, so they went to the bank to exchange them yesterday morning and afternoon. However, the bank's accumulated funds were substantial, and those who went to exchange them were able to exchange cash and leave satisfied. According to the bank's regulations, foreign exchange will be stopped after 5 p.m. every day. Yesterday, in order to show its credit, it posted a notice at the door, stating that the office hours would be extended to 8 p.m. The notice said: "Our bank will extend its office hours to 8 p.m. today and will open early at 8 a.m. tomorrow morning (that is, this morning)." As a result, those who went to exchange gradually retreated, and by 7 o'clock, it had returned to its original state, which was no different from usual. It also shows that the bank's credit is evident and the rumor-mongers' efforts are exhausted.</p>

<h3>Xiong Shihui Returned to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Got off at the Zhenru Railway Station Yesterday</p>

<h3>Layman Lin Yin</h3>
<p>Destroys His Home to Help Disaster Relief</p>
<p>Sells Property and Gets More Than 220,000</p>
<p>Uses 200,000 to Relieve Flood Disasters</p>
<p>The Chinese and Foreign Relief Society received a letter from someone named Layman Lin Yin yesterday, along with 200,000 yuan to help relief efforts. The country is in a difficult time, and the disaster is urgent. To resist foreign insults, we must first stabilize the country. The urgency of disaster relief is as urgent as a fire. We have this great philanthropist who destroys his home to help disaster relief. Raising his voice, I believe there will be responders. This is not only good news for the 30 million disaster victims, but also ironclad proof that people's hearts have not died. The original letter is attached below:</p>
<p>Respected Sirs, I have been living in seclusion in the mountains, isolated from the world, for many years. However, there is still a line of connection that cannot be completely severed, that is, my children send me the Shanghai Daily News every day. My children are filial and caring, afraid that I will be lonely in the deep mountains, so they use newspapers to relieve my boredom, and I cannot bear to refuse. Although the newspapers sent have been accumulating for a long time, I have never opened them to read them. They are all tied up and put on the shelf. These days, I have been sitting quietly, uneasy, and my heart is fluctuating. I feel that my mind is not pure, and my dregs are not exhausted. I have been arrogant in imagining introspection to blame myself. On the one hand, I still sincerely calm down and belittle myself in many ways, but I still cannot stop it. I picked up a bundle of newspapers and opened them to read them, to relieve my tense thoughts. Unexpectedly, various newspapers detailed the floods in various parts of the southern province, the water and fire, and the fierce disasters. There are also Hu Wenhu, a great philanthropist, who donated Tiger Balm, Headache Powder, Bagua Dan, and Qingkuai Water, and other medicines and huge donations, and overseas Chinese and domestic philanthropists enthusiastically recognized the donations to save the catastrophe. I live in seclusion in a secluded valley, and I cannot help but be shocked when I hear of this tragic situation. I believe that the restlessness of my heart these days is actually the compassion of my Buddha, silently showing the truth of saving people and saving myself. Only our generation adheres to the words "form" and "emptiness", but we still cannot stand idly by and watch people die. Therefore, I resolutely supported my cane down the mountain and discussed with my wife and children to relieve the suffering of the family. Fortunately, my wife and children did not refuse, unanimously agreed, and urged me to carry out disaster relief as if I were fighting a fire. I have sold all my thin property, earning more than 229,800 yuan. In addition to withdrawing more than 29,800 yuan for the cost of my wife's old age and the children's share, I intend to ask my friends to remit the remaining 200,000 yuan to the contribution meeting to meet the needs of disaster relief. I have always admired your association for its efforts in disaster relief over the years. The true donations are not falsely spent, and the actual benefits are for the disaster victims. Countless people have been saved. The whole country has a reputation for it. There is no religious discrimination or political influence. However, since I have gradually thinned out, I know that a drop in the bucket will not help the salary. I hope that Chinese and foreign philanthropists will appreciate my foolish sincerity, hear the wind and rise up. We must know that this disaster is a catastrophe that is rare in the ages. All of us Chinese people should jointly rise up and do our best to maintain it, so that the survivors after the disaster can slightly preserve their vitality. I hope that the great philanthropists of your association will hold the heart of hunger and drowning, and call for help from the high ground, so that it is not difficult to build a tower by accumulating sand and to make a robe by collecting armpits, so that tens of millions of disaster victims who are waiting to be slaughtered can be reborn. When I am in the mountains, I should pray for the great philanthropists day and night, without end. After I have finished my worldly affairs, I will return to the mountains immediately, and from now on my heart will be clear and cool, I will not deal with worldly affairs, and I will never set foot in the world again. Sincerely to the kind gentlemen of the Chinese and Foreign Relief Society, Lin Yin bows and says goodbye. In addition, I continue to see in the daily newspapers that the floods in Jiangbei are extremely serious, and the accumulated water is not receding. It is difficult to express the situation. Is it possible to transfer my donation to Jiangbei? It is now urgent to drain the accumulated water and use work as a substitute for disaster relief, so that both sides will benefit and the disaster victims will have hope of survival, so that the spring plowing next year will not be without harvest. I also ask all the good people to pay attention to this. If my intention is not feasible, please let your association allocate it as needed. And again,</p>
<h3>Baoshan Dike Protection Association</h3>
<p>Requests Thorough Investigation of Dike Works</p>
<p>The sea dikes in Baoshan County were attacked by storms and tides, and the entire dike was in danger everywhere. The Jiangsu Provincial Government quickly allocated huge sums of money and ordered the Jiangnan Dike Works Office to rescue them quickly. It has been half a month. Recently, Xue Zhaoshu, the director of the Jiangnan Dike Works Office, reported to the provincial government on the rescue situation, saying that since the dike was in danger, more than 100 workers have been hired every day to work separately, and the rescue project has been completed by 80%. When the dike protection committee of the county heard the news, it immediately sent many members to the dike to conduct an on-site investigation. It was found that there were 23 workers working in the Wuyuedun section, 17 in Chenhuabin, more than 40 in Zhangjiazha, more than 130 in Xuejiatan, and less than 30% of the earth bags. There were more than 20 in Niantoujing, and less than 10% of the earth bags. In addition, no one was working. The total number of workers was only more than 200. The rescue project was less than half completed, and most of it was done hastily. The dike protection committee found that the results of the above-mentioned survey were greatly inconsistent with those reported by the Jiangnan Dike Works Office. It was obvious that Director Xue of the office only sought personal gain and falsely reported to the provincial government. The dike is still in danger. If it is breached, not only will the lives and property of the entire Baoshan County be turned into nothing, but Shanghai will also perish. In addition, Taiga and other counties will inevitably be affected. After immediately convening a meeting of all members for discussion, the crowd was indignant. Yesterday, they sent a telegram to Shen Baixian, the director of the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department, about Director Xue's false report, requesting a thorough investigation to ensure that the work is real and the money is not wasted, so as to protect the lives of the people in the county.</p>
<h3>Zhang Xilin Kidnapped</h3>
<p>The Car Was Found Near Guanghua University</p>
<p>Zhang Xilin, a local, opened the Lishengchang Store at No. 147-8 Shandong Road, specializing in silk threads and factory silk business for more than ten years. At about 7 p.m. last night, Zhang took his own chartered car from outside to the store, preparing to dine. When he walked to the middle of the store, he was taking off his gown and had not yet sat down. Two kidnappers suddenly came from outside the door, wearing blue cloth shirts and pants, and holding pistols. They mixed into the store, dragged Zhang out, and tied him to car No. 8381, which was parked near the Sino-Western Pharmacy. Then they drove straight south, turned west at Avenue Edward VII, and disappeared in an instant. After reporting to the Central Patrol Room in charge, they immediately sent detectives to investigate. About an hour later, car No. 8381 was found near Guanghua University on the newly built Da West Road outside the boundary. It is said that the car is a small Austin brand, black in color, and owned by Mr. Wang. At the time of the incident, the driver drove it out, and the driver did not know where he went. Zhang Xilin is 51 years old and lives on Beile Road in the French Concession. When the bandits went to kidnap him, there were six in total, two bandits were on guard outside the door, and two bandits were in the car.</p>
<h3>Downstairs in the New Customs Building</h3>
<p>Thieves Steal and Injure People</p>
<p>Stabbed Severely After Leaving the Store</p>
<p>2,500 Yuan Stolen</p>
<p>Jin Yongfa, a native of Changshu, an employee of the Xinfu Foreign Firm at No. 9 Avenue Edward VII, was ordered to take 2,500 yuan in banknotes to the cashier's office on the fourth floor of the New Customs Building at about 4 p.m. yesterday. Unexpectedly, as soon as Jin arrived downstairs in the New Customs Building, five thugs who had been ambushing there rushed forward as soon as they saw Yongfa, stabbing him in the abdomen with a knife, causing his large intestine to flow out. He was also stabbed three times in both hands and three times in the chest. He was robbed of 2,500 yuan and then they all ran away. Later, the Central Patrol Room No. 1671 and No. 1308 arrived and sent the injured person to Renji Hospital for treatment. The situation of the robbery was reported to the head of the patrol room, and he ordered Chinese and Western detectives to investigate the murderers and punish them severely.</p>
<h3>Ten Thousand Dollars</h3>
<p>A Massive Fraud Case Involving Warehouse Receipts</p>
<p>The Futai Exchange Was Also Defrauded of Four Thousand Dollars</p>
<p>The Handwriting and Seals Were No Different From Before</p>
<p>The Tongyi Trust Company at 126 Beijing Road had unconditionally deposited public bond warehouse receipts worth 100,000 yuan with the Wenzhou Fuzi Exchange. On August 31st, they received a letter from Fuzi in Wenzhou stating that someone would be sent to retrieve the warehouse receipts. The next day, a man claiming to be Zhu Ming arrived and the receipts were handed over in full. Unexpectedly, they then received a telegram from Wenzhou Fuzi stating that the exchange's documents and seals had suddenly been lost and requesting that the warehouse receipts be carefully guarded and all payments stopped. Tongyi immediately telegraphed back, saying that Zhu Ming had already taken them in full. The exchange then sent someone to Shanghai to investigate the truth and learned that</p>
<p>Dai Dingfu From Wenzhou Was Highly Suspected in This Case and Was Planning to Sell the Receipts in Hangzhou, So the Informant Lin Shoumei Went to Hangzhou to Arrest Dai. At the same time, Xu Bohua was also arrested, but after questioning, Xu was found to be uninvolved and was released on the spot. Dai was then escorted to the First Special District Court in Shanghai and confessed that the masterminds behind the case were Zeng Liulin and Zhu Xiang, who were staying in Room 511 of the Dongya Hotel on Nanjing Road. When the police went to arrest them, Zeng and Zhu were not there. Xu Bohua, who had been arrested and released in Hangzhou, and several others from Wenzhou, including Zhao Luoshu, Chen Susheng, and Chen Yuanyao, were arrested and brought to court. After an initial interrogation, Zhao, Chen, and Chen were released as they were found to be uninvolved. The court also sent a letter to the Wenzhou District Court to investigate whether the Jincheng Exchange had commissioned Dai Dingfu to contact the Zhongnan and Yanyue Banks in Shanghai for business (as Dai had claimed to be commissioned by the exchange to come to Shanghai for business). The Tongyi Trust Company and the managers of the Futai Exchange, which had also been defrauded, were summoned to court for questioning. Yesterday was the court date, and Judge Jiang Gongliang presided over the trial. Dai Dingfu testified that he was 21 years old, from Wenzhou, and worked at an exchange. He was arrested in Hangzhou because the police said that</p>
<p>Zeng Liulin Had Defrauded Public Bonds Because I Knew Him and Was Suspected of Being Involved, But I Did Not Know the Details. At this point, the police lawyer stated that Dai Dingfu had been arrested in Hangzhou. He had met Zeng Liulin in Shanghai, and Zeng had asked him to contact the Agricultural and Industrial Bank in Hangzhou to sell bond receipts, giving him 500 yuan as entertainment expenses. The informant, Lin Shoumei, manager of the Wenzhou Fuzi Exchange, learned of this and reported it to the authorities, leading to his arrest. As for Xu Bohua, the Wenzhou Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association and the Wenzhou Junior Public Middle School sent letters of support, stating that Xu was not involved in the case and had a profession.</p>
<p>There Were Only Two Suspicious Points (1) When He Was in the Police Station, He Claimed to Be Unemployed and Was With Zeng, Seeking Work. (2) Zeng Liulin Arrived in Shanghai First, and Xu Came Later. Why Was Xu Arrested and Released in Hangzhou, Only to Be Arrested Again at Zeng's Place in Shanghai? According to Xu Bohua, he was an accountant at the Wenzhou Public Middle School. He came to Shanghai to purchase instruments for the school. He arrived in Shanghai from Hangzhou on August 28th and met Zeng Liulin while matching goods at the Shixue Tongyi Hall. They had previously been introduced by Zeng to a dentist and were fellow villagers. Since arriving in Shanghai, he had been staying at the Xiangbin Hotel, where many fellow villagers from Wenzhou stayed. Zeng also came to see him there. He arrived in Shanghai on the same boat as Dai. The police lawyer then stated that when Xu was arrested in Hangzhou,</p>
<p>He Was Questioned and Released Because He Was Found to Be Uninvolved. At That Time, the Informant Lin Shoumei Returned to Shanghai After Arresting Dai Dingfu in Hangzhou, and Xu Followed on the Same Train, Going Directly to the Dongya Hotel to Report to Zeng Liulin. This Behavior Was Highly Suspicious. When Questioned, Xu Stated That He Had Visited Me in Shanghai, But I Had Gone to Visit Him, So He Was Arrested Unexpectedly. Next, Li Wenjie, the representative of the Tongyi Trust Company, stated that they had dealings with the Wenzhou Fuzi Exchange. Previously, they had unconditionally deposited 50,000 yuan in reorganization warehouse receipts and 50,000 yuan in 19th year rehabilitation warehouse receipts, totaling 100,000 yuan, with the company. On August 31st, they received a letter from the Wenzhou Fuzi Exchange dated the 27th, stating that the receipts were needed for other purposes and that Zhu Ming had been entrusted to retrieve them. The next day, Zhu Ming arrived with another letter and a business card. After examining the</p>
<p>Letter and Handwriting and Seals, The Tone Was the Same as Previous Letters and the Most Recent Letter. They Trusted Him and Handed Them Over on the Spot. Unexpectedly, After the Payment Was Made, They Suddenly Received a Telegram From Fuzi in the Afternoon Stating That the Seal Was Lost and the Bond Receipts Should Not Be Paid, But It Was Too Late. Moreover, Zhu Ming Said Before Leaving That the Government Would Repay the Principal and Interest of the Bond Receipts at the End of the Month, Which Could Be Done Through the Futai Exchange, Amounting to Over a Thousand Yuan. Because They Knew That the Two Companies Had Dealings With Each Other and Had Always Done Things This Way, It Made People Even More Unsuspecting. The Means of Deception Were Very Meticulous. Next, Jin Runfu, the agent of the Futai Exchange, stated that they had dealings with Fuzi. Before This Incident Occurred, There Was a Debt of One or Two Thousand. On August 28th, They Received a Letter From Fuzi Stating That Chen Shouqing Had Been Specially Sent to Withdraw 4,000 Yuan. The Next Day, Someone Claiming to Be Chen Arrived to Withdraw the Money. The Handwriting and Seals Were No Different From Past Dealings, Making It Impossible to Detect the Fraud.</p>
<p>Therefore, They Paid Without Suspicion. Later, They Received a Telegram From Fuzi and Realized That They Had Been Defrauded, But the Payment Had Already Been Made. They Had No Choice But to Telegraph Back, Saying That It Had Been Referred. At This Time, the Police Lawyer Requested That the Four Letters of Withdrawal Be Handed Over to the Police to Check the Handwriting, Because Xu and Dai Had Written Confessions in the Police Station That Could Be Compared. Whether to Prosecute the Escaped Zeng Liulin and Zhu Xiang Would Be Resolved at the Next Court Hearing, Because It Was the Police's Usual Practice to Only File Charges After the Defendant Was Apprehended. At This Point, the Court Adjourned the Hearing and Summoned the Plaintiff Lin Shoumei to Attend the Trial.</p>
<h3>The Pacific Conference Will Open as Scheduled</h3>
<p>A Preparatory Meeting Will Be Held in Shanghai Starting on the 12th</p>
<p>Formal Conference Representatives Will Not Be Allowed to Attend</p>
<p>The Japanese Military's Invasion of the Northeast Will Be Discussed</p>
<p>The Fourth Conference of the Pacific International Academic Association, originally scheduled to be canceled due to the Japanese military's invasion of the Eastern Provinces, has recently been encouraged by the Central Government. Yesterday morning, our preparatory committee held a meeting and decided to proceed with the conference as originally scheduled, from the 21st of this month to the 4th of November, in Hangzhou. It was also decided to hold a preparatory meeting in Shanghai for one week starting on the 12th of this month. As for the issue of Japanese representatives attending the conference, after repeated discussions between Mr. Green, the American representative and chairman of the conference, and other representatives from Britain, France, Canada, etc., it has been decided that they will only attend the preparatory meeting and not the formal conference. Regarding the issues to be discussed, in addition to the case of the Japanese military</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>Committing Atrocities in the Northeast, Which Will Be the Subject of Extremely Important Discussions, It Has Also Been Decided to Discuss the Overall Theme. Furthermore, when representatives from Britain, the United States, Canada, and other countries arrived in Shanghai aboard the British ship Empress of Canada, the American side immediately sent a representative named Lao Kao to Liaoning to investigate the Japanese military's atrocities in order to gather information for the conference's discussion of the Manchurian case. Yesterday, it was learned that the representative had already arrived in Shenyang and would continue to investigate in Jilin and Changchun. However, according to a reporter from the New Sound News Agency who visited Mr. Massey, the former Canadian Prime Minister and a representative attending the conference, the day before yesterday, Mr. Massey said that he was unaware of this matter and did not wish to express his opinion on the Manchurian incident.</p>
<h3>Smooth Communication of Wired Telegraphs Between Shanghai-Fuzhou and Shanghai-Hankou</h3>
<p>The Quzhou Telegraph Bureau Installs Fast Telegraph Machines to Assist Telegraphing</p>
<p>Telegraph Transmission Between Fujian and Guangdong Is Very Fast</p>
<p>The Direct Line Between Shanghai and Hankou Has Also Been Repaired</p>
<p>In April of this year, after our country recovered the Xiamen Gulangyu submarine cable of the Great Eastern and Great Northern Telegraph Companies, the Shanghai-Fuzhou direct land line of the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau on Sichuan Road in this city suddenly became busy. This was because all telegrams sent from Shanghai to Fuzhou, Xiamen, Quanzhou, Hanjiang, and the two Guang provinces were relayed through this line. In addition, international telegrams sent from various countries to Fujian and Guangdong, which used to be relayed by submarine cable companies, are now routed through the land line due to the recovery of submarine cable sovereignty. The volume is even greater than before. However, the line passes through the entire province of Zhejiang to Fuzhou, which is too long, and it is old and prone to damage, causing frequent disruptions in work. In view of this, and in order to maintain our country's telegraph reputation to the outside world after recovering telegraph sovereignty, the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau specially requested and obtained approval from the Ministry of Communications to allocate funds to order the Shanghai-Fuzhou Telegraph Main Line Works Bureau to carry out major repairs, and ordered the Shanghai Telecommunications Machinery Manufacturing Plant to configure fast telegraph machines to assist telegraphing and install them in the Quzhou Telegraph Bureau. At present, the line repair project has been completed, and the auxiliary motor of the Quzhou Telegraph Bureau has also been connected. Recently, news from the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau on Sichuan Road stated that the Shanghai-Fuzhou line has been extremely smooth since the major repairs and the installation of the auxiliary motor. In the past, it could only send 40 to 50 telegrams per hour, but now it can send 150 to 160 telegrams. The speed and capacity have increased more than threefold, and the telegraph signals are clear and there are very few errors. The merchants and people from Fujian and Guangdong stationed in Shanghai are all very satisfied.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau's direct line to Hankou was previously disrupted by the floods in Hankou, as well as the flooding along the Yangtze River, such as in Wuhu and Jiujiang, which damaged many telegraph poles and made it impossible to repair them for a time. Now that the floodwaters have receded, Tao, the chief engineer of the Shanghai-Hankou Telegraph Main Line Works Bureau, personally went to Wuhu, Jiujiang, Daye, and other places to inspect the damage and supervise the engineers and line workers to rush to repair it day and night. It was restored to its original state yesterday morning (the 2nd). The Shanghai-Hankou direct fast machine dual-operation work has resumed. Since Hankou was devastated by the floods, the market has almost collapsed. After the floodwaters receded, the restoration of the Hankou market and telecommunications is particularly important. The bureau has carefully reorganized the telegraph services in Hankou and other places, all with the premise of assisting commercial development and facilitating the people.</p>
<h3>Memorial Service for Chiang Wei-shui of Taiwan Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Location: Penglai Movie Theater, Xiaoximen, Shanghai</p>
<p>The Shanghai All Circles Commemorate Mr. Chiang Wei-shui of Taiwan Preparatory Committee Public Announcement: Mr. Chiang Wei-shui of Taiwan led the people of Taiwan in engaging in the national liberation movement for twenty years. His purpose was to seek freedom and equality for the people. Although he suffered the oppression and imprisonment of Japanese imperialism, his revolutionary spirit was never diminished. His name will be eternally recorded in the revolutionary history of Taiwan. Unfortunately, the tragic news came that Mr. Chiang passed away in Taiwan at 7:30 a.m. on August 5th. The loss of such a great teacher is a great loss to the future of national liberation for the revolutionary people of Taiwan. All our revolutionary comrades at home and abroad should also deeply mourn. Therefore, it has been decided to hold a memorial service for Mr. Chiang at 9:00 a.m. on October 4th at the Penglai Movie Theater in Penglai Market, Xiaoximen, Shanghai City (the Huajie 2nd and 3rd Road roundabout trams all reach the front door). At that time, we respectfully hope that you will send elegiac scrolls and send representatives to enthusiastically participate in order to console the departed martyr and encourage those who follow. This is our earnest request. Please send elegiac items to Mr. Zhuang Xiquan, Zhuang Chuncheng Firm, No. 7 Jiuxingli, Xinkaihe, French Concession, Shanghai for forwarding.</p>
<h3>Wang Zhengting Arrived in Shanghai by Ship Yesterday</h3>
<p>Proceeding Directly to the Hospital for Long-Term Recuperation</p>
<p>Former Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Zhengting arrived in Shanghai aboard the Yongshui warship from Beijing at 11:00 a.m. yesterday, landing at the Gaochangmiao Naval Dock. He was accompanied by Mrs. Wang, Ms. Shi Meili, and others. Yang Nianzu, Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office, personally went to the dock to take care of him. After landing, Wang proceeded directly to the hospital by car for recuperation. It is reported that the injury has almost completely healed and only requires rest.</p>
<h3>The Harbor Quarantine Station Issues</h3>
<p>Report No. 10 on the Prevention of Cholera</p>
<p>The Harbor Quarantine Station issued Report No. 10 on the prevention of cholera in Shanghai yesterday, stating: (1) During the week from September 20th to September 26th, the cholera situation in this city has not changed much. According to the survey, the report is as follows: There were 38 cases of cholera in the Chinese area this week, with 3 deaths. There were 29 cases in the Public Concession (including 1 foreigner), with 3 deaths. There were 7 cases in the French Concession (including 1 foreigner), with 3 deaths. (Including foreigners) In total, there were 74 cases and 9 deaths last week. According to the above situation, the cholera epidemic is likely to gradually disappear in the near future. (2) The Wusong Quarantine Hospital of this station still has 1 cholera recovery patient. In the past week, ships from Hankou have been thoroughly inspected and no suspected cholera patients have been found. Therefore, the number of patients in the Wusong Quarantine Hospital has not increased. However, in order to prevent the epidemic, passengers from Hankou to Shanghai are vaccinated against cholera when boarding in Hankou. When arriving at Wusong, they are re-examined by the medical officers of this station. Those who have not been vaccinated are given vaccinations at any time. (3) Director Wu Liande took the Gonghe wheel to Hankou on the morning of September 26 to inspect the epidemic situation in the flood-stricken areas in order to plan epidemic prevention and harbor quarantine measures. After Wu returns to Shanghai, he will definitely have new methods for preventing cholera to contribute to society and the public.</p>
<h3>Wanfu Temple Is Transferred to Municipal Ownership</h3>
<p>The Public Works Bureau Is Starting to Plan</p>
<p>Previously, the Shanghai Zhabei business community requested the Municipal Public Works Bureau to transfer Wanfu Temple on Datong Road to municipal ownership because it protruded into the road and hindered traffic, and to demolish the temple to facilitate traffic. Yesterday, we received a reply from the Public Works Bureau, which is copied below: In reply, your association's letter of the 21st of this month requesting that Wanfu Temple be transferred to municipal ownership and that the road be reorganized, etc., shows concern for municipal administration, which is deeply appreciated. In addition to ordering the department to refer to it and start planning, this letter is specially replied to, so please take note.</p>
<h3>Guangdong People Aid Disaster-Stricken Fellow Villagers to Return Home</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Guangdong Guild Hall and the Guangdong Overseas Chinese Business Federation rescued fellow villagers from the Hankou disaster area who came to Shanghai. The other day, the Wuxue steamer brought the fourth batch of more than 70 men, women, and children. The guild hall and others sent personnel to receive them and take care of their accommodation in the Da'an Inn. Yesterday, they took the Taiyuan steamer to return home. On the same day, the Wuchang steamer brought the fifth batch, totaling more than 60 people, who were still received at the Da'an Inn. They took the Qiongzhou steamer home on the first of this month.</p>
<h3>The Oriental Review Weekly Is Published</h3>
<p>The Oriental Review Weekly, which has been in preparation for a long time and was founded by well-known people in this city, was published today. The content is very rich and includes many anti-Japanese articles. It is quite brilliant. Those who subscribe for half a year have the hope of receiving hundreds of yuan in gifts.</p>
<h3>The Hongkou Epidemic Hospital Extends Its Closing Date</h3>
<p>Since its opening this year, the Hongkou Epidemic Hospital in Yinxiang District has been crowded with patients, with more than 100 outpatients every day, resulting in a large budget overrun. It was originally scheduled to close at the end of September to prepare for the construction of permanent hospital buildings. However, it received a letter from the Bureau of Health stating that the epidemic situation this year is more serious and must be extended to October 15th to avoid the risk of cholera patients having nowhere to go for treatment. It is now reported that the hospital has agreed to do its best.</p>
<h3>The Ya Ge Troupe Will Perform the Play "Down With Snobbery" Tomorrow Night</h3>
<p>In view of the current rampant violence of Japan, the Ya Ge Troupe has specially rehearsed a new play, "Snobbery," by Zhu Choushi and Wu Jiangfeng. The plot depicts snobs doing all kinds of evil in an incisive and thorough manner. In the end, they are overthrown. Tomorrow night, at the National Road City Exhibition, the troupe will be invited to perform this play. This is also a manifestation of fulfilling the national duty, awakening compatriots, and jointly relieving the national crisis.</p>
<h3>China Now Has Chemical Porcelain Products</h3>
<p>Chemical porcelain products used to be imported from the West, resulting in a huge annual outflow. There was no alternative. The Science Instrument Museum contacted Jingdezhen two years ago and, after many setbacks, finally succeeded. The first batch of Bunsen electromagnetic cylinders has been shipped and is of better quality and glaze than imported products. The second batch of mortar samples has also arrived and has been tested and found to be suitable. The remaining products, such as evaporating dishes, crucibles, and various items for sericulture, are also being studied. This is indeed good news for promoting domestic products.</p>
<h3>Survey Statistics of the Value and Types of Japanese Imports</h3>
<p>Table</p>
<p>The Japanese invaders are rampant, and the whole country is indignant. Patriots from all walks of life are boiling with enthusiasm and rising up to carry out the movement to save the country and resist Japan. As it stands, before the National Government decides on a policy, boycotting enemy goods is indeed the only passive weapon to punish the Japanese invaders. Most of Japan's surplus production ends up in our country's market, accounting for more than one-third of our country's imports. The total value of Japanese goods imported in the last three years is staggering. If Chinese goods were shipped to Japan in such quantities, the Japanese would definitely be terrified and cry out about economic difficulties. According to the survey, the value of Japanese goods imported in 1928 was 334,757,417 taels (customs taels), equivalent to more than 500 million yuan in national currency. In 1929, it was 338,523,097 taels, equivalent to more than 505 million yuan in national currency. In 1930, it was 338,356,529 taels, equivalent to more than 505 million yuan in national currency. Therefore, the lifeblood of our nation has been unknowingly sucked dry by the Japanese. Even if they no longer treat us with inhumane cruelty, we should still make nationwide efforts to create products in order to recover the huge outflow. Now that the invaders have penetrated deeply and disaster is imminent, the boycott of goods must not be as lax as before. There should be a permanent plan of action. The first step must be to investigate the quantity, value, and types of Japanese goods imported. After the investigation is clear, Japanese goods exhibition halls and large-scale Japanese goods exhibitions should be set up in various places so that the public can know the true face of Japanese goods and avoid confusing them with domestic products. It can also provide a basis for the industrial sector to study and improve. It is reported that the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has completed the investigation and statistics of the quantity, value, and types of Japanese goods in the past three years and has produced statistics. We have obtained the full statistics of the investigation and will publish them in the newspaper day by day as follows.</p>

<h3>Suggestions from Sha Bingruo (For. Japan. Four. Items.)</h3>
<p>I have been reading your newspaper for days and have seen reports of the Japanese military's atrocities. We must awaken our compatriots and jointly face the national crisis. Your newspaper has always been known for its fairness and patriotism. I dare to propose the following four items, please publish them in the newspaper: (1) The Ministry of Education should order all bookstores to incorporate the Japanese military's atrocities into the textbooks of primary and secondary schools, so that the innocent and simple primary and secondary school students can recognize Japan and stimulate their patriotic feelings. (2) Please ask all bookstores to edit a large number of books on Japanese issues and reduce the price of books, such as The Manchurian Problem of Great East Asia, China's Twenty-Year Sino-Japanese Relations, and A Modern History of Japanese Imperialism's Aggression Against China, so that our fellow compatriots can also make an effort to purchase and read them. (3) Please ask all newspapers and magazines to announce and comment as much as possible on all Japanese actions and facilities if they are investigated, so as to give the people correct guidance.

<h3>Miss Mou's Inquiry (Regarding Whether or Not to Sell Goods to the Japanese)</h3>
<p>At this time when the Japanese bandits are displaying their martial prowess, the hearts of the entire nation are filled with indignation, and there is a unanimous call for economic severance with Japan. However, I have some doubts about this, and I would like to ask for your guidance, sir. I am currently working in a store in Hongkou. The owner is Chinese, and usually many Japanese people patronize it. Ever since those Japanese bandits seized the Northeast, the Chinese are furious and refuse to look at them. However, the Japanese bandits still patronize our business as usual. I would like to ask if we should continue to sell to them? If we sell, would it be a violation of economic severance?</p>
<p>(Reply) Since the people of the nation have declared economic severance, we should not sell goods to them. You should first explain this point to the store owner, and also agree with your colleagues to adopt a consistent attitude. It is important to be firm in your stance, but avoid causing disputes in language. This is crucial.</p>
<h3>Mr. Jin Yeqiu's Inquiry (Proposing a Cloth Clothing Association)</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese army occupied Shenyang, our compatriots have suffered this brutal experience. From now on, our lives should be simplified as much as possible. At this time, it is necessary to advocate wearing cloth clothing. The only effective way for India's Gandhi to subdue the British was to simplify his personal life and not use British goods. Chinese society has been accustomed to extravagance in recent years, and imported goods are highly regarded for daily necessities. Those who call themselves the intellectual class are especially fond of Western suits and leather shoes. The city admires the high, and all directions are higher by a foot. This trend has spread from cities to villages, without any limit. Therefore, the responsibility for changing the atmosphere lies with those of us who call ourselves the intellectual class. From now on, our youth should change to old cloth student uniforms to establish a national spirit of patriotism and supporting national goods. There are often people in society who judge others by their appearance, and regard those who wear plain clothes as ignorant villagers. This trend is especially prevalent in Shanghai. Therefore, before implementing the cloth uniform system, we should first unite several like-minded comrades and create an association to hang on the lapel, to express one's belief. The emblem of the association should be shield-shaped, with a depiction of Hou Yi shooting down the sun on the front, to show the object of one's efforts. On the back, write a simple warning, so that it is striking and does not become dull over time. This will make society respect those who wear cloth clothing and despise those who wear imported clothing. Such a change will have a very important and great impact on the country. I dare to ask the reporter to speak out loudly for this cause.</p>
<p>(Reply) Very good. We will publish your proposal. We also hope that everyone will start from themselves.</p>
<h3>Miss Shao's Inquiry (Omitted) (Marriage Problems)</h3>
<p>(Reply) After reading your letter, I deeply understand that your thoughts and actions are noble and pure. Now I give you three words: (1) Freedom of marriage is granted by current laws. Since there is nothing to be ashamed of, you can be completely unhesitating. (2) In everything you do, you should not be too hasty. When the water flows, the channel will be formed, and it will naturally be complete. (3) The sick body must be treated. Since you believe in religion, you should broaden your mind and vision, and eliminate the psychology of restraint and sorrow. A relaxed state of mind will have a very rapid impact on your physical health.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Heartbreaking Words</h3>
<p>— Juan</p>
<p>Dear compatriots, there is a Western saying that goes "A tooth for a tooth, an eye for an eye." A tooth for a tooth and an eye for an eye means that if someone bites me, I will bite them back. If someone stares at me, I will stare back. This is originally a very fair method. But how do our Chinese people treat foreigners? If someone bites me, I just pat myself and let it go. If someone stares at me, I just lower my head and let it go. Even if a foreigner wants to slap my face, I offer my face to their hand. If a foreigner wants to chop off my head, I offer my head to their knife. Alas, this is called courtesy, this is called tolerance, this is called love of peace.</p>
<p>From The Unweeded Garden, Talks by Zhai Fu</p>
<h3>A Thorough Cleaning</h3>
<p>Someone asked me, "Why do you contribute to Free Talk?" I said, "I just love the word 'free' in its name." When I see Free Talk, I think of the freedom of children, the freedom of women, the freedom of oppressed people, and the freedom of small and weak nations around the world. Here, I want to fire the cannons of freedom, break the city of slavery, seize the weapons of the slave owners, and unshackle the slaves, so that no one will ever be a slave again, and everyone will become a free person. Someone says that slaves also have freedom. How so? Before becoming a slave, they must have the freedom to choose their path. Whether they fight and die as a free person or beg for survival as a slave of a conquered nation, in between, don't they have the freedom to choose? So, unless they are determined and willing to be slaves themselves, no one has the power to force them to be slaves. What we need to eradicate completely is this kind of slavish mentality. If this slavish mentality is not thoroughly eradicated, a world of freedom will never be realized. Good! Let's give it a thorough cleaning!</p>
<p>"Who has a pen of freedom?</p>
<p>Let's sweep together!</p>
<p>Until what day?</p>
<p>No slaves on the earth!"</p>
<h3>The Painful Words of a Returnee from Shenyang</h3>
<p>— Jiang Jianyi</p>
<p>My friend, Mr. Jiang Jianxing, works at the Shenyang Arsenal. He personally experienced the disaster of the Japanese Kou's attack on the city on the 19th. Yesterday, he returned south in disguise, having narrowly escaped death. He described the bestial atrocities of the Japanese army, which were hair-raising. I will now record three of the things he said.</p>
<p>When the Japanese army entered Shenyang, after successfully attacking the Beida Camp Arsenal, they disarmed all the police in the city at the same time. Then, guided by ronin, they rushed into people's homes like wolves and boars. They ordered stores to hang Japanese flags everywhere. Jiang was staying at his friend Mr. Guo's house at the time. Guo ran a general store in the business district and lived there with his family. On the morning of the 19th, amidst the sounds of gunfire, the Japanese army crowded into their house. Mr. Guo tried to avoid them, but the Japanese army dragged him out and ordered him to hang the Japanese flag immediately. He was unable to comply in such a rush. Then they kicked and beat him severely. Amidst his cries of pain, a bullet took his life. Jiang, along with Mr. Guo's elderly mother and family members, were taking the opportunity to escape when the Japanese army aimed at them from behind. Bullets rained down. The old mother tripped first. Mr. Guo did not even have time to see her. Jiang fell to the ground, injured his forehead, and his face was covered in blood. He barely escaped with his life. In his dazed state, he still heard the miserable screams of Mr. Guo's wife, who was being forced into a separate room. The sound was so terrible that it broke the hearts of those who heard it. Mr. Jiang said that he was weeping at the time, saying that if this hatred is not avenged, what is the point of wearing a head.</p>
<p>After the Japanese army began to kill on a large scale, corpses piled up in the streets, blocking the roads. The Japanese did not ask the reason and shot anyone wearing Chinese clothing on sight. Especially those wearing student uniforms and Zhongshan suits had no chance of survival. Mr. Jiang personally saw more than ten workers and students, dressed in work clothes and student uniforms, fleeing in panic, their faces pale. Later, the Japanese army chased after them. When they could no longer escape, they forced them to stand side by side against a wall and cursed at them in Japanese. Then, one by one, they were executed. Those who tried to escape were also shot and killed, none surviving. Mr. Jiang lay among the corpses, with the backs of the Japanese soldiers stepping over him. He said that even though he did not die, the pain and horror he witnessed were more agonizing than death itself.</p>
<p>Jiang's younger brother, Lingxiao, was studying at the highest institution of learning in the Northeast. On the night his school was surrounded, he first saw the flames of artillery fire lighting up the sky. The whole school was in chaos. Then he heard the sounds of killing shake the earth. The Japanese army surged towards them like a tide. Jiang's younger brother nearly fell victim to a sharp blade, and in his anger, he wanted to die. Later, he escaped to look for his brother. He has been separated from him since then. Jianxing fled to Huanggu Tun and saw his brother's classmate among the refugees. Only then did he learn that Lingxiao had escaped from the school. However, his whereabouts have been unknown since the scattering. It is likely that he was buried with his blood splashing on our lost land. Jianxing has an elderly mother who dotes on her youngest son. He said that since he escaped death, he often recalled the tragic sights of disembowelment, chest-stabbing, and corpses lying in pools of blood. He also remembered his younger brother. Alas, rather than be a weak slave, it is better to be a heroic ghost. I do not have time to mourn for Lingxiao, nor can I console Jianxing's grief. Moved, I wrote four poems: Ten thousand calamities have finally led to today's change. There is no place on earth where one can greedily cling to life. Singing and weeping are common occurrences. There must be people who shed blood on the battlefield. The earth shakes and the sky rumbles again this time. A broken body and a dead heart leave endless grief. Indeed, the methods are like those in Korea. Ten thousand heads cannot be exchanged for return. Painfully crying and pleading cannot bear to express all. How can this matter be empty talk? Carrying weapons and wearing armor, let us die on the sandy battlefield. It is not yet satisfying to have killed Japanese slaves. Weeping blood and piercing our hearts, we will never forget. Ten thousand people cry out, willing to die together. This is no longer a day for calmness and composure. Let us pull the strong bow and shoot the sun. (Moving to help with disaster relief)</p>
<h3>The Enemy Tower in Muzhen for Destroying Japanese Pirates</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>The battlements still overlook the riverside. The small, fortified pass defends against the enemy.</p>
<p>Today, the smoke of war has long dissipated. The setting sun and fragrant grass face the remaining spring. This poem is by Wang Ruyu, praising the Muzhen Rescue Tower. The enemy tower is located at the end of the White Pagoda Bridge. It is more than thirteen zhang wide and three zhang six chi high. It is built on a foundation of stacked stones and the four sides are made of bricks. There are holes on the sides to fire arrows, stones, muskets, and cannons. I moored my boat in Xiangxi and once strolled beneath it. From there, one can see the beautiful scenery of Lingyan and Zhiqiu, which are close at hand, inspiring a desire to look up and emulate. It is truly a beautiful place. According to the county records, this tower was built during the Jiajing period of the Ming Dynasty by the Censor-in-Chief Shang Weizhi. It is one of the ten scenic spots of Muzhen. Legend has it that in the thirty-fourth year of Jiajing, Japanese pirates burned and looted almost everywhere from Fengqiao to Muzhen and the Western Mountains. The military commander Ren Huan and the commander-in-chief Tang Kewan led strong soldiers to fight them. The pirates fled into Taihu Lake and burned and looted both Dongting Mountains. Later, they harassed the Baodai Bridge again. They were surrounded by Ren Huan's troops. The pirates broke through the encirclement and crossed the Five Dragon Bridge, fleeing to Meiwang. The next day, they fled to Sangyan Mountain. Ren Huan searched and captured them, killing many pirates. This is the location of the enemy tower. After Ren Huan died, the residents built a temple for him in Zoumatang and sculpted his image to offer incense. They did not forget his great contribution in suppressing the pirates. Unfortunately, after the war, the temple image was changed and no longer resembled the original attire. At this time, when the East China Sea is turbulent and the pirates are committing atrocities, I wonder if there is a Ren Gong in this world. Even if I were to hold his whip, I would be willing. Ren Gong, styled Yinggan, from Anren. I specially record this to serve as a model for suppressing the Japanese pirates today.</p>
<h3>The Chinese Peace-Loving People Who Blindly Believe in Justice</h3>
<p>— Hu Jingping</p>
<p>Recently, apart from a few people who have realized that the word "justice" is not very reliable, the rest are still blindly believing in this intangible, invisible, and unrealizable "justice." We can see this from the fact that many people are still hoping that the League of Nations or the United States (or even Russia) will come out to help.</p>
<p>In my opinion, blindly believing in justice is a pompous word used to deceive oneself. In fact, it is precisely the cowardice of us Chinese.</p>
<h3>Preliminary Discussion on the Fundamental Problems of Resisting Japan and Saving the Nation (3)</h3>
<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>Boycotting Japanese goods is the most urgent task for China at present. As long as we work hard to boycott, I dare to predict that Japan will discover three terrifying phenomena in three years: (1) Large-scale industrial and commercial paralysis, leaving only a part to supply domestic demand. (2) Extreme economic panic due to industrial and commercial paralysis, which will inevitably lead to internal deterioration. (3) The people will confront the government, and political unrest will occur. At that time, Japanese imperialism will naturally tend to soften and change their ferocious face. Therefore, I say that the final victory will belong to us. However, boycotting Japanese goods is still a passive way to save the country. The first priority is to increase production so that we can exchange goods for goods, which is an active boycotting strategy. Therefore, in terms of the current situation, these two things must be done simultaneously and cannot be neglected. Because if we only boycott without producing, we will still need foreign goods, and the rights and interests will still flow out. The following points can also be used as references:</p>
<p>(1) Leaders of various industries and businesses should take the lead in starting factories, pooling capital, or encouraging capitalists at home and abroad to invest actively. The type of goods to be manufactured should be determined according to the urgency of the need. Existing national goods factories should take this opportunity to find ways to increase production and expand their operations. The government should provide rewards and reduce taxes. For example, in terms of cotton yarn, which is the most needed commodity in the current society, fine yarn of 36 to 42 counts is almost entirely Japanese goods. Now that the supply route has been cut off, there is an urgent need for similar substitutes. Then the China Cotton Yarn Mill Association should convene a meeting to discuss how to add fine yarn equipment and rush to ship goods to meet the urgent demand. If they continue to hesitate, it is simply self-abandonment. Other industries should also convene their peers to cooperate earnestly and eliminate the most despicable mentality of "envy among peers."</p>
<p>(2) Japanese industrial and commercial organizations in Shanghai and other places are trending towards strikes and shutdowns. Our Chinese employees have specialized skills. National goods factories should seize the opportunity to hire them. It is best to organize an agency to handle registration and placement of these people. At the same time, the government and all sectors of society should work together to help solve their livelihood problems after unemployment.</p>
<p>(3) Shanghai should first try to set up a research institution, preferably sponsored by the Anti-Japanese Association. Recruit experienced professionals in industry and commerce. Start with investigations. The types, qualities, prices... of Japanese goods should be accurately statistically analyzed in detail to make various reports for national goods factories to use as a reference. Newly returned industrial and commercial talents from Japan can participate in this work. (4) The Ministry of Industry has long had plans to establish five major factories. Using the country's financial resources to do so is indeed easy to achieve. However, these five major factories are progressing slowly. I don't know when they will be successful. In fact, we Chinese have the raw materials, capital, and talent to run large-scale industries. Unfortunately, there is a lack of enthusiastic advocates.</p>
<p>Now, both Beijing and Guangdong are showing a clear understanding of the greater good. The national plea for "peaceful unification" and Mr. Sun Yat-sen's last words when he was dying, "peaceful unification to save China," can be realized again. However, peaceful unification must also have a permanent guarantee. A virtuous and capable government should also be produced quickly. I hope that our virtuous and capable government will also promulgate a five-year plan to complete the construction of national defense, internal affairs, diplomacy, education, industry and commerce, transportation, etc. according to a specific plan and within a time limit. Revitalizing China and avenging national hatred is the duty of the government. Our 400 million compatriots should work together to promote its realization. Selfishness, dependence, living for the moment, and other inferior character traits are all evident. As a great country, with soldiers, generals, and people, we still think of asking other countries to help when we are being bullied. Even if this is realized, I think it is just adding a second shame of enduring grace on top of the first shame of being bullied. However, most Chinese are actually dreaming that the League of Nations will sanction Japan, or that the United States will send a number of troops to drive the Japanese out of the three northeastern provinces, while we sit idly by and wait to enjoy the fruits. The so-called party-state dignitaries are still enriching themselves and protecting their own power, playing the game of being king among monkeys. Alas, if one has a little self-respect, who can willingly endure this supreme shame? But when China is in danger, it is still filled with this despicable hope.</p>
<p>The Chinese are truly a peaceful people (this sentence is said except when it comes to internal affairs). Instead of saying that they are not competitive, they insist that others are tyrannical. Instead of saying that they are cowardly, they insist that others are barbaric. Moreover, when they are well-fed and have nothing to do, they still loudly sing the tune of world harmony and boast of their brilliance. But who would be willing to "harmonize" with our self-despising, self-deprecating nation and lower their status as a strong country? To be frank, if we want world harmony, it will only be possible when China defeats Japan and also ranks among the major powers. Otherwise, let those Chinese who blindly believe in justice and empty slogans of world harmony cease.</p>
<p>Correction: In the article "Remembering Han Shichang's Martyrdom in the Sino-Japanese War of 1894" the other day, "Han Shichang" was actually a mistake for "Deng Shichang." Deng's descendants, who are famous in the business world, include Deng Junrui, the owner of Deng Zhuang in Hangzhou. We hereby make this correction and thank Mr. Gu Zhipan for pointing it out in his letter.</p>

<h3>The Pestle for Knocking on Dreams (3)</h3>
<p>— Cheng Zhanlu</p>
<p>"Layman, if China one or two hundred years ago were to appear before your eyes, what would you do?"</p>
<p>"If it were to appear, I would be my peaceful people"; "This place is happy, I don't miss Shu". "It is easy to realize, you only need to sit on this rotating chair". The elder pointed to the chair in the middle and said.</p>
<p>"Old monk, is it true"? Tao Chi chewed on the taro in his mouth, saying vaguely.</p>
<p>"This old monk does not lie. Once the layman sits on the chair, I guarantee that you will realize that dream of a peaceful China in the 18th century."</p>
<p>"Sitting on the chair, can it turn back the years"? Tao Chi said in surprise. "Just turning back the years cannot show the wonderful use of the rotating chair; this rotating chair has three incredible effects: one can make time flow forward, two can make time flow backward, and three can make time stand still". "The old monk's words are too wonderful, please tell me the details".</p>
<p>"Layman, please eat a few more taro, and I will tell you. Time changes with the rotation of the Earth. The Earth is 25,000 miles in circumference and can rotate once in 24 hours; then the speed of the Earth's rotation at the equator should be more than 1,000 miles per hour. China is located in the temperate zone, far from the equator; according to the rule of the Earth's rotation, the farther away from the equator, the slower the rotation speed. Suppose the speed of rotation in our place is 800 miles per hour; once you sit on this rotating chair; the rotation of the wheel is ten million times faster than the Earth's rotation, that is, the Earth rotates 800 miles per hour, and the speed of the rotating wheel is ten million times 800 miles; spending a day on Earth is just passing the hours, but spending a day on the rotating chair has already passed ten million hours. So once you sit on the rotating chair, sitting for an hour, you can see the future history ten million hours later; this is called making time flow forward".</p>
<p>"Please explain how time reversal is explained"?</p>

<h3>Bidding for Gold Amidst the Battle Between Bulls and Bears in the Financial Market</h3>
<p>The trend is confusing and continues to decline by two taels. Yesterday and the day before yesterday, the changes in the bidding for gold were not small, sometimes advancing and sometimes retreating, making it difficult to grasp. The morning market was above 730 taels, and the afternoon market had already broken into the 30 tael range. The whole day saw a decline of 18 taels in retrospect. In short, under the stalemate between bulls and bears, the result continued to fall by two taels and zero. However, the turbulence began to subside. Large investors had different ways of seeking supply. British silver fell while American silver rose. Therefore, the market opened low. Later, due to active buying, the trend rose higher, once breaking through the 740 tael mark. As the exchange rate seemed chaotic, many speculators from Guangbang and foreign firms, such as Qiao Zhifu, sold off, turning downstream and retreating by 10 taels. In the afternoon market, the selling pressure became even stronger, and the exchange rate was even looser, continuing to fall by about 10 taels.</p>
<p>The morning market once broke out of the 740 tael mark. In the morning opening, November and December were mixed at 727 taels, already down 3 taels.

Before long, it added more than 2 taels, and when British gold was announced, it was 33 taels and 4 qian, but the banks did this month's US gold at 31.125. Then Mitsui absorbed 25, and British gold did not change, and US gold hung at eight-thirds of a cent, and the East exchange went down one cent, that is, it dropped to 31 taels. After entering, British gold seemed to be bullish, from 625 to half a penny, and US gold could only be settled at 31 yuan, the market such as Tai Chang, Cui Chang, Yong Yuan Mao, Yong Chang Sheng Yong, etc. all advanced, there are Wu's IOUs, and with the Citibank hedge also came to advance, but the price straight up to the sky, reached a high price of 42 taels at ten minutes past ten, after which Heng Xing, Da Xing Yong Dai, Qiao Zhifu and Shunli, Wan Xing, Zhi Feng Yong, etc. sold off one after another, and the market situation changed from sharp to weak, shedding about ten taels, at ten thirty was thirty-two and a half taels, and after a while, small retailers took this opportunity to advance, and the price rose again by four or five taels, at eleven thirty was thirty-seven and a half taels, but the sellers did not stop, Yi Feng Yong and items were sold, so the afternoon closing was only thirty-three taels, the announced price was changed to eight hundred and fourteen taels and two qian, accounting for about eighty taels,</p>

<h3>Gold Exchange Announcement on US Dollar Settlement Price</h3>
<p>November Transactions Extended to End of December for Settlement</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Gold Exchange issued two announcements regarding the change to using the US dollar as the standard for settlement prices and the extension of the settlement period. The content is transcribed below: "In response to an official letter from the Shanghai Exchange Supervisor, citing the chaotic foreign exchange market and the need to prevent potential problems, this is to inform you that, given the sharp drop in the British pound and the potential for further fluctuations in other currencies, which would inevitably have an impact, the Exchange convened a board meeting. It was unanimously agreed that the US dollar is considered stable, and physical cash can be transported at any time. Therefore, Article 47 of Chapter 10 of the Business Regulations will be temporarily amended to allow for forward trading. At the end of the period, if the goods have not been fully delivered, the initial exchange rate quoted by HSBC on that day for the US dollar, plus shipping costs, will be used as the standard, with US$240 per tael of standard gold for settlement." This decision was communicated to the Exchange's Brokers Association, which subsequently agreed to implement the change. This announcement serves to inform you that, effective immediately, the amended provisions of the Business Regulations will be implemented accordingly.</p>
<p>Another announcement stated: "Given the distance between China and the United States, it is temporarily necessary to extend the settlement period. Therefore, the transactions already concluded in November will be extended to December 31 as the final settlement deadline. At that time, if the goods have not been fully delivered, the amended provisions of Article 47 of Chapter 10 of the Business Regulations will be applied," and so on.</p>
<h3>London Silver Market Calm</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 2nd: The London silver market is completely still. Spot remains at 15 9375 pence, forward at 16 125 pence, the same as the previous day's closing price.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Initially Firm, Then Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the overseas silver markets showed divergent trends, with the British pound falling and the US dollar rising, while exchange rates generally increased. The Japanese yen and the US dollar both fell by one point, to 4938. Market conditions were generally stable, but HSBC's quotes showed slight changes. The US dollar increased by 375 points to 29.375 yuan, due to speculation in large foreign exchange transactions. The Japanese yen decreased by one point to 1 tael 6 qian 9 fen. The British pound remained unchanged at 1 shilling 5 pence 75. The Indian rupee increased by 25, the French franc increased by 7 yuan, and the German mark increased by 1 mark. Other currencies such as the Vietnamese piastre, Singapore dollar and Hong Kong dollar remained unchanged. The domestic market was initially firm, then stable, and weakened in the afternoon. As a result, compared to the day before, the British pound increased by 0.0625, the US dollar increased by 25, and the Japanese yen decreased by one and a half points. The gold market fluctuated, ultimately declining slightly, breaking below the 30 tael level. There was significant trading by Chinese merchants, mainly in US dollars, as the settlement price has been changed to US dollars, as already decided. However, there was selling by gold merchants, totaling approximately 700,000 to 800,000 yuan, to invest in gold bars. Banks continued to actively buy British and US currencies. About 100,000 pounds sterling were traded, but most transactions were to cover previous short positions. Japanese yen trading was mostly to square positions.</p>

<h3>Silver Dollar Market Atmosphere Calm</h3>
<p>Market Overview: Recently, after the surge in boycotts of Japanese goods and economic sanctions, various business categories have calmed down. Although domestic goods and other imported goods have tried their best to compensate, the people's minds are focused on national salvation, and they are not paying attention to commercial warfare. Therefore, the current business situation in the financial sector is quite dull. The joint resignation of the Chinese compradors of Japanese banks is particularly impactful on the financial sector's quietness.</p>
<p>Brokerage Prices (Taels per Mill): The early market brokerage price was 7 qian 2 fen 4 li 8 hao 7 hu and a half. The afternoon market was 7 qian 2 fen 5 li 1 hao 2 hu and a half.

Copper coins remained at 375,500 wen. Silver Dollar Inflow and Outflow (Silver Funds): Bank receipts and payments were particularly quiet yesterday. Chinese merchants' receipts and payments totaled 1.67 million, foreign merchants' receipts and payments totaled 1.34 million, and various goods, tax, and miscellaneous receipts totaled over 8 million. 300,000 went into the warehouse, and 400,000 went out of the warehouse.

<h3>Securities and Salt Tax Fall by 2 Yuan 9 Jiao</h3>
<p>Other Bonds Fall by Over 1 Yuan, Customs Tax Alone Rises</p>
<p>Yesterday, on the Securities Exchange, there were no spot transactions in any of the bond markets, and futures trading continued only in the October contract. The November contract was still not open. Because the October contract required the provision of physical goods, the market remained calm. As Japan's conspiracy against our Northeast intensified, buyers became more cautious, leading to a dominance of selling in the market. Although there were no major fluctuations, there was no consistent trend, with prices fluctuating up and down. As a result, compared to the previous day, the salt tax fell by as much as 2 yuan 9 jiao. The 2.0 Customs Consolidated Tax, 1926 (善整) and 6% bonds each fell by 1 yuan 5 jiao 6 jiao. Other fluctuations were still minor, with only the customs tax continuing to rise by 1 yuan 1 jiao compared to the previous day. Observing the bond market situation, it is still not easy to predict, and whether the diplomatic situation can improve will remain a major factor in the rise and fall of bond prices, it was said. The volume of futures trading was about 6.6 million in the morning and about 2.9 million in the afternoon, totaling 9.15 million yuan.</p>
<p>Bond Type | Contract/Spot | Previous Opening | Later Closing | Change from Previous Day | Volume</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn Market: Morning Weariness, Afternoon Vigor</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market was flat in the morning and rose in the afternoon, with the trend remaining chaotic. The global situation is very pessimistic, and economic sanctions against Japan mean that Japanese yarn cannot be sold, relying instead on Chinese yarn, which is insufficient to supply demand. Therefore, the factories' existing stocks have long been emptied, and market prices have naturally soared. However, the financial situation is bleak, and the floods in all directions are severe, so the price increase may lead to stagnation of current sales. In the afternoon, rumors circulated in the market that Indian merchants were buying in large quantities, which further intensified the rising trend.</p>
<p>The nominal price in the after-market rose by 1 to 2 taels. The nominal price opened flat in the early market. Due to the sluggishness of American cotton and the fact that major players had sold off many long positions the previous day, market sentiment was particularly weak. Apart from one or two taels per month, the second and third rounds of trading rebounded again, resulting in a flat outcome. In the afternoon, market prices rose sharply by 1 to 2 taels. The total volume of transactions for the whole day was 62,900 bales. Sales were made by Da Ji (达记) for 2,500 bales, Lao Xing (劳兴) for 1,600 bales, Geng Feng (赓丰) for 1,300 bales, Sen Kang (森康) for 1,450 bales, Chang Feng (长丰) for 2,300 bales, and Yi Yu (义馀) for 1,850 bales. Purchases were made by He Shen (和慎) for 1,200 bales, Gong Tai (公泰) for 1,800 bales, Yi Cheng (义成) for 2,300 bales, Yi Chang (益昶) for 1,050 bales, Xin Cheng (信诚) for 1,450 bales, and De Ji (德记) for 1,150 bales. The closing prices are recorded below: Nominal Closing Prices, Changes, and Account Balances</p>
<p>October: 1645, up 1, 238, 3501</p>
<p>January: 1657, up 1, 8109, 400</p>
<p>November: 1658, 2097, 200</p>
<p>February: 1658, 2282, 950</p>
<p>December: 1658, 19114, 500</p>
<p>March: 1656, 2333, 600</p>
<p>The sales of the 1,760 bales of spot cotton yarn were still good. According to statistics, various merchant groups bought 1,100 bales throughout the day, and fellow merchants took in 660 bales. The market was firm and rising. Merchant groups from Changsha bought 350 bales, Guangdong bought 185 bales, Jiangxi bought 275 bales, inland areas bought 90 bales, Sichuan bought 90 bales, and miscellaneous groups bought 100 bales, it was said.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Dragged Down by American Cotton</h3>
<p>American cotton prices fell sharply and continued to reach new lows, and the situation was extremely precarious. Foreign firms were actively selling spot cotton in the market at particularly low prices. Today's price was about one or two taels lower than the previous day. Although local factories made purchases, they did not dare to absorb as much as possible due to the unfavorable overall trend. Transactions in local cotton were completely taken over by foreign cotton. Indian Oomra cotton was priced at only 23 taels (in India), more than 10 taels lower than nominal cotton. This situation is unprecedented. Given this situation, both American and Indian cotton will be overstocked in Shanghai. The future is unpredictable.</p>
<p>Han Nominal Price Falls by Two, Three, Four, or Five Qian. The Han nominal price opened in the morning market with a more intense fall in American cotton prices, falling by three, four, five, or six qian. The afternoon was flat, with each month rebounding by five fen to one and a half qian. The total volume of transactions for the whole day was 110,260 dan. Sales were made by Mei Ji (梅记) for 4,000 dan, Gong Tai (公泰) for 5,400 dan, Tian Long (天隆) for 2,700 dan, Xin Cheng (信诚) for 4,800 dan, Yi Chang (怡昌) for 4,200 dan, and Yi Yu (义馀) for 2,000 dan. Purchases were made for 6,800 dan by Shen Chang (慎昌), 4,000 dan by Chang Feng (长丰), 6,400 dan by Yu Da (裕大), and 2,900 dan. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>

<h3>Grain: River-bottom Rice Market Loosens</h3>
<p>South Head: Yesterday's supply was still surging, with 30 to 40 boats. Sales in the local market were sluggish. The price of new japonica rice from Tongli was soft, and the Shen Regulations were cheaper. However, the Suzhou market remained fixed. Buyers reported a weak appetite due to abundant supply. Prices fell by 3 jiao. New Yang Du Jian (洋杜尖) fell by 2 jiao. Early rice and thin rice were weak, and prices tended to soften. Hundred Ge Rice (百哥稻) was momentarily popular, but sales suddenly slackened. Top-quality goods fell by 1 jiao and a half. Glutinous rice prices were unstable. Although the supply was continuous, sales were still active, and prices were neither rising nor falling. New Gate: The supply was slightly available, and the inventory was also thick. The outlet was weak. Western New Top Japonica (西新顶粳) was still around 16 yuan, and Central Off-grade (中关宿次) was 2 to 3 jiao lower. The overall trend was difficult to boost. Although thick and thin broken-grain land reported stable prices, it was also not good, so prices fell back by nearly 1 jiao. Sales of South Gang Thin Rice Hundred Ge (南帮薄稻百哥) were particularly sluggish, and wholesale prices fell by 4 to 5 jiao. New Yang Lu Jian (新洋芦尖) still had a small number of country buyers, and the market was able to stabilize. Jiao Bai Jian (茭白尖) also softened by 2 jiao.</p>
<h3>Futures and Spot Rice Fall Another 5 to 7 Fen</h3>
<p>Small Twisted Rice Continues to be Ordered</p>
<p>Backwater Rice Falls by 1 Qian</p>
<p>Yesterday, Yang rice continued to open lower, and new transactions were being solicited by foreign firms. The situation was even softer. Yesterday, Jinlong sold 3,000 tons of small twisted rice for March at a price of 5 taels and a half, which was 7 fen lower than the previous day. Backwater goods: 10 tael small twisted rice was 5 taels and 2 qian, and 11 tael rice overweighed at 5 taels 3 qian 2 fen, which was more than 1 qian lower than the previous market. Small twisted spot rice opened with 500 bags at 11 yuan and 8 jiao, down another 5 fen. Central off-grade goods were at 11 yuan and 6 jiao. The market was still showing a soft trend, it was said.</p>
<h3>The Cause and Effect of the Plunge in the Vermicelli Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the vermicelli market presented another state of plummeting, because the price of foreign wheat fell by another two, three, or four jiao, etc., and the recent price was again the lowest record abroad. From this, it was speculated that the excess abroad had not escaped the dangerous situation. The domestic situation was that the source of foreign wheat continued to come in without interruption of previous contracts. On the surface, it had not reached excess, but because the factory's inventory was abundant and the miscellaneous grains industry had not yet touched the floating wheat, it could be seen that problems had already occurred between supply and demand. If the bulls in other ports had to solve this mountain-exhausted time, they had to come back hard. If this wind did not move, it would not fall, and if it did move, it would not fall. The continuous fall these days was the reason for this. As a result, this month fell by 2 fen and 2.5 li compared to the previous day, November fell by 3 fen, December fell by 2.5 fen, January fell by 3 fen, February fell by 2.5 fen, and March fell by 2 fen, it was said.</p>
<h3>Wheat Prices Open at the Lowest Record Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market fell unanimously, because the price of foreign wheat had gradually fallen back, and the degree of decline had opened the lowest record again. The market air was shocked by the recent surge of foreign wheat, and the long-term presence of foreign wheat was a comparison. People were depressed, and the general Yangtze River Road customers saw that they were returning, so the opening prices in each month were not good. Observing the latter step, if the foreign wheat pours in, and the way out cannot be resolved, the coming of change may be unpredictable. As a result, this month fell by 5 fen compared to the previous day, November and December fell by 5 fen, January fell by 4 fen, February fell by 5 fen, and March fell by 9 fen on the market compared to the previous day. Spot wheat trading was very quiet. Yesterday, Kunshan wheat opened at 3 taels 5 qian 4 fen and 3 taels 4 qian, totaling 400 bags, which were handled by Huafeng, it was said.</p>
<p>Sugar Market: Taikoo Sugar Factory Prices Rise Step by Step</p>
<p>Raw Sand White Opens Over 5,000 Bags</p>
<p>Yesterday, the price of Cuban sugar was still 1.40625, and the price of New York futures sugar for December was 1.39, up 2 fen compared to the previous telegram. March was 1.35, May was 1.39, each up 5 fen, and the new price for September was 1.48. The price of spot Java sugar was 7.500, and the futures sugar prices for each month were 7.625, with no rise or fall compared to the previous day. The Association's market for Dutch sugar, 24-grade raw sand white, was actively traded, and the price of new goods was 11 taels 4 qian to 5 qian, and the high-quality coarse grain sugar was 11 taels 6 qian. The goods were also scarce. 20-grade medium sand white was 10 taels 9 qian, soft Dutch white was 11 taels 9 qian, bowl blue was 8 taels 3 qian, and 9-grade Dutch red was 9 taels 4 qian. The market was firm and beautiful. Taikoo Sugar's DYHX brand market inventory was still sparse, HM brand was 11 taels 6 qian and a half, and B brand was 12 taels 2 qian and a half. The trend was quite strong. Huaxin opened 500 bags at a price of 11 taels 2 qian and a half. Zhensxiang sold over 1,000 bags of new medium sand white for 10 taels 9 qian. Chen's raw sand white was 3,000 bags for 11 taels 2 qian, and oil bag goods were also sold for 2,600 bags for 11 taels. The buying intention of the business party was quite strong, and they were all sold. The Taikoo Sugar Factory's market also called for a 5 fen increase, and people had already inquired, so it must be returned to the telegram for confirmation. From this, it can be seen that the market image is up.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: Golden Needle Vegetables Fall Again and Again</h3>
<p>Golden needle vegetables have been falling back recently. Previously, the market was prosperous, and Dingzhuang vegetables once rose to over 29 taels, and the market was also very tight. It is well known that sales in various places have gradually decreased recently, so the market has changed from good to tired, and has fallen back again and again. The price has fallen by about two taels before and after. Recently, only Guangdong, Fujian and other provinces have a way out, but the numbers are not large. Yesterday, the market price of Dingzhuang vegetables was 27 taels, and the upper and middle Zhuang was from 21 taels and a half to 19 taels. The middle and second Zhuang was 18 taels and a half. The market was flat and tired. Silk Tea: Gongxi tea from Wuyuan and Tunxi was selling strongly to Russia. Yesterday, the Russian Assistance Association's intention to enter the market was still strong. Over 900 boxes were traded in the city. The top market opened at 55 taels, with no rise or fall compared to the previous day. Needle eyebrow, Phoenix eyebrow, pistil eyebrow, and shrimp eyes also had scattered transactions. Market prices were firm, but the most important Zhenmei green tea was not asked by anyone in the city. The future of the tea market could not be considered optimistic.</p>
<p>Hardware: American Tinplate Gradually Rises. American tinplate has recently been enthusiastically purchased by various gangs, and the source is very fresh. The market has risen step by step. 48 pieces per dan can be sold to 18 taels and 6 qian, up another qian and a half from the previous day. 28-gauge was 19 taels 2 qian and a half, 26-gauge was 18 taels 5 qian, and 24-gauge was 17 taels 5 qian, also better than the previous qian. Transactions, especially 48 pieces, were the most enthusiastic. It was estimated that 300 to 400 dan were sold in the market yesterday. It was heard that there was very little goods in the next batch, so people were in a good mood, and the market was expected to continue to rise.</p>
<h3>Blue Lead Deteriorates with Each Situation</h3>
<p>Blue lead transactions have been very few recently. Although overseas telegrams have been reporting increases, the people in this port have not been invigorated because there are not many actual sales. Prices are oppressed by the adverse environment, so there is a general feeling of deteriorating. The current estimate is 15 taels and 2 qian and a half, which is actually 2 to 3 qian lower than the previous one. According to recent speculations by the general public, the market may have to fall again in the future.</p>

<h3>The Spirit of the Children</h3>
<p>— Huang Huanruo</p>
<p>This article was written and waiting to be sent when the Japanese bandits</p>
<p>had already launched a large-scale invasion of our eastern province.</p>
<p>Hair stands on end, eyes widen in fury, the whole country shares the same indignation.</p>
<p>I do not know how the children, after receiving this</p>
<p>news, will react with such</p>
<p>indignation.</p>
<p>Because Xue Mei had matters to attend to and could not teach at the school, she asked me to temporarily take over her duties. Thus, the childish me actually ran onto the podium and started acting as "teacher" with gestures. The life of a "Monkey King" is not necessarily as annoying as people curse it to be, sitting on a "cold bench." I have always admired the naturalness and greatness of primary school teachers. If it weren't for a greater mission weighing on my shoulders, perhaps I would also be a small general in the field of primary school education.</p>
<p>The children seemed to have quite good feelings towards me. During class, they listened innocently to my lectures and watched my performances. Even though they instinctively liked to move around, they weren't too noisy. After class, many children gathered around the desk. When taking a walk, many children swarmed around me. The cries of "Teacher," "Teacher," continuously entered my ears, asking questions and eagerly awaiting my replies. This scene was harmonious and beautiful.</p>
<p>The children loved listening to stories the most. Taking advantage of this opportunity, I mixed many supplementary teaching materials into it. Historical stories, enough to cultivate sound national character, were instilled as much as possible, taking this opportunity to achieve a subtle and transformative effect. A certain eugenicist said that China is a hopeless country because the Chinese nation's innate nature is a bad seed. I resolutely oppose this absurd argument. I have always believed that the superiority or inferiority of a nation entirely depends on the level of education. The effect of education is not dead injection, but the subtle influence of the sea. Children love to listen to stories, and educational materials that benefit their minds are the best opportunity for cultivation. When history reached the modern stage, many deeds that could inspire national spirit were left behind. One day, I compiled a story about the historical relationship between China and Japan, preparing to tell it to them. The word "Japan," just mentioning it verbally, even people in remote rural areas would feel anger rising in their hearts. The curse of "dwarf slaves" poured out of the mouths of the people. When the children heard that it would be about the Japanese, everyone expressed their strong agreement. The words "Wanbaoshan Incident" also floated in the children's group.</p>
<p>Starting from how China and Japan came into contact, I talked about the Sino-Japanese War, the Twenty-One Demands, the Wanbaoshan Incident, and finally, the Japanese soldiers' cross-border interference and the inspection work of the anti-Japanese association, and the event of looting goods seized by the anti-Japanese association. The children listened attentively and were unusually excited, but it was somewhat different from peacetime. Smiles were not on their innocent little faces, and their brows were furrowed, obviously, the innocent and peaceful childhood hearts had also been stirred by uneven waves.</p>
<p>"Teacher, then why don't we Chinese go to war with them?" a child asked suspiciously and indignantly.</p>
<p>"Our weapons are not as sophisticated as theirs, not as many as theirs, so we can't win against them," I replied unnaturally.</p>
<p>"Then, we have no hope. We will become slaves to a conquered nation, won't we?" another抢着asked. His body had already stood up from his seat. Dozens of small faces full of suspicion all stared straight at my face, naturally eagerly awaiting my reply.</p>
<p>"That's not necessarily the case. As long as we are willing to strive for self-improvement, we can also become a strong country. However, if we remain unconscious like this forever, then it is really hopeless," I said. I was very happy. The children were not as hopeless as a certain eugenicist said because their enthusiasm fully expressed traces of self-awareness.</p>
<p>"Teacher, if we don't want to be slaves to a conquered nation, do we have to save the country? If we want to save the country, should we boycott Japanese goods?"</p>
<p>"That's right, we want to save the country, we want to boycott Japanese goods. Everyone, do you have any Japanese goods at home? If you don't have any Japanese goods yourselves, I hope you won't buy Japanese goods again in the future," I said to them enthusiastically, and the children were also listening enthusiastically. "Also, in addition to boycotting Japanese goods, don't forget that other foreign goods should also not be bought, unless it is absolutely necessary to use foreign goods. Furthermore, I hope that the children will work hard and sincerely persuade your relatives and friends. From now on, everyone should be affectionate, united, and work together to overcome all difficulties. We should cooperate in all undertakings. Only in this way will foreigners dare not bully us, and only then will China have a prosperous and strong day."</p>
<p>This class ended with excitement and vigor amid the ringing of the bell. The children were not as calm as usual. A kind of patriotic climax of enthusiasm and courage was brewing in the children's group.</p>
<p>The next day, when several of us teachers were taking a walk in the village, we actually saw several children propagating their national salvation policy to the farmers. The farmers also awakened and cursed the Japanese bitterly, nodding their heads in praise of the policies the children were talking about.</p>
<p>In this way, a fervent anti-Japanese atmosphere permeated the entire village.</p>
<p>The spirit of the children is truly extraordinary. Who says that the Chinese nation is hopeless?</p>
<h3>Jiaotong University in the Anti-Japanese Voice</h3>
<p>— Quan</p>
<p>Jiaotong University has a glorious history in past student movements. In recent years, many talented people have emerged from the school, occupying considerable positions in the engineering and scientific fields. The school authorities' cultivation efforts and patriotic movements have also had an impact. This time, when news of the Japanese's atrocities arrived, the student union's representative assembly of the school held several temporary emergency meetings and resolved to convene a general assembly to discuss ways to save the country. All students attended the meeting, crowded and respectful, setting a record never seen before. After the chairman reported on the Japanese atrocities, the atmosphere in the entire venue suddenly became tragic. Some covered their faces and wept, while others cried out loud. At that time, the entire body resolved to immediately organize an Anti-Japanese National Salvation Committee to handle the following matters:</p>
<p>(1) Military Training: The school's military training was originally strict. Students were fully armed with live ammunition, practicing twice a week. The results were quite remarkable. Last time, the directorate of training inspected the school and was amazed. It was commended by an order from the ministry. Now that foreign aggression is imminent, students should urgently use armed force to save the country. Special military training is being intensified. All students who are not scheduled to lecture must practice for four hours every day, teach for two hours, and camp out in tents at night, and practice field warfare situations, so that students can have sufficient military knowledge when they serve on the battlefield in the future and fight the Japanese.</p>
<p>(2) Military Chemistry: Xu Mingcai, a chemistry professor at the school, was originally the chief engineer of the Hanyang Arsenal and has in-depth research on military chemistry. Now, he is specially adding more research hours, burying himself in the laboratory, preparing to research a kind of (Mustard Gas Cl·C2H4·C2H4Cl·) for wartime use, hoping to succeed by June to help him in his research is the famous chemist Zhang Huaiyi.</p>

<h3>Aviation in Malaya Qiu Bin Cun (Continued)</h3>
<p>There are other airfields that are under construction. After the completion of various aircraft fields in the Malay Peninsula in the future, not only will mail delivery be faster, but passenger air travel can also be achieved.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>My conclusion is that when the Malay airfields are scattered like stars and extremely meticulous, not only will the postal and transportation affairs of Malaya itself have considerable development, but the economy and culture of Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia will also have amazing progress. This kind of statement is observed from its good aspects. If we observe from its bad aspects, the world economy is trapped in the dangerous cliff of depression. The United Kingdom is still desperately developing British and Australian aviation, then its other intentions can be known. Because the British colony spans Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia, if there is no sensitive military force as a guarantee, there is a danger of losing it everywhere. Its intention to build a military port in Singapore and develop British and Australian aviation is nothing more than to obtain military contact, so as to permanently retain its acquired territories and rights and interests. Therefore, on the day when Malayan aviation is fully developed, the United Kingdom will be like a tiger with wings added, and its position in Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia, especially in the Far East, will be as stable as Mount Tai and cannot be shaken.

<h3>Japan's Insidious Means of Dealing with Northeast附属Territories Qiu Yao Min</h3>
<p>The outbreak of Japanese imperialism's armed invasion of China this time is not an accidental move, but has its profound basis. We only need to observe his usual management of the Northeast, and we can get a general view. Last year, I went to the Northeast because of something, and I personally saw and heard all kinds of insidious and rigid means used by Japanese imperialism to deal with the local subordinate people. Now, I will list them as follows. From this, we can probably see the determination of Japanese imperialists to meticulously manage the Northeast and their actions of seizing land and killing people this time.</p>
<p>(1) Openly Establishing Opium Retail Stores Opium retail stores are not only densely packed in urban areas (such as Dalian Toutaogou...), but also everywhere in rural and remote areas. For example, in Dengshahe, a very small rural area, there are two publicly sold opium stores. There are countless in Dalian. There are probably no less than seventy or eighty stores in Changchun Toutaogou. According to the investigation of the Taidong Bao, the total income of opium retail stores in Dalian alone reaches more than 4,000 yuan per day. If we try to enter these opium retail stores, we can see countless compatriots swallowing clouds and spitting fog, "a lifetime career of happiness (?) lantern flowers," and not caring about anything. Not only</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>this, the most vicious morphine, heroin... are also sold everywhere, and are popularized to the most miserable people. Therefore, the brains of our compatriots are numb, and they are more easily ruled. (2) Giving small favors to win over the people The most vicious and insidious means of the Japanese in treating the people of the leased territories is to give small favors. Because of this, ordinary people with dim minds and narrow vision will sing praises to them and tend to them. For example, teaching people how to grow cotton and providing medical treatment... they do not hesitate to spend a lot of money and do their best. Once, I personally saw two or three Japanese people pruning apple tree branches for the people "free of charge" in an apple orchard in the countryside. At that time, heavy rain was imminent, and the common people who were listening to him lecture on plant physiology all slipped away, while these few Japanese people who loved the people like their own children (?) still worked in the rain. How can you not be impressed?</p>
<p>(3) Forcibly Buying Land On the one hand, Japanese imperialists use insidious and soft means, but on the other hand, they do not hesitate to reveal their ferocious faces. Now, their barbarous and forceful means, such as forcibly buying land, are the most important examples. It is said that the land is forcibly bought at the price stipulated by their Kwantung Office 丨 the lowest price.</p>
<p>The above is just a few of them. The rest, such as schools, rural self-government associations... are all scheming and fighting, doing their best to fulfill their instinct to invade.</p>
<p>Now they are coming in a big way. They not only want to manage the leased territories, they want to seize our three northeastern provinces, they want to destroy our entire country. Arise, arm yourself and expel Japanese imperialists, and recover the leased territories.</p>
<h3>French General Foch's Diary of the European War Gu Ang Ruo, translated</h3>
<p>The Allied General Offensive, October 15 to November 11, 1918</p>
<p>The Allied forces advanced between the North Sea and the Meuse River, with a front of two hundred miles, attacking in separate directions, naturally avoiding encountering formidable enemies in several places. It is difficult to predict the extent of the enemy's resistance. Only by studying the terrain in front of each army and the speed of each army's advance can we know a little. But in general, the Allied forces from right to left, that is, from the mountainous area on both sides of the Meuse River to the great plains of France, the terrain is lower and flatter. From ancient times to Waterloo, the fate of Europe was often decided there.</p>
<p>In the area north of the Aisne River, our army can most easily use its superior forces. The most important advantage in modern times is that our army's equipment and ammunition supply exceed the enemy's. The astonishing progress made by the British army here is clear evidence of this. Continuing to advance is also obviously beneficial. Moreover, with the influence of our army's separate attacks, the blow suffered by the enemy in one place will inevitably affect other places. Therefore, although other places are still sufficient to resist, they are also affected and shaken.</p>
<p>On October 10, I asked Marshal Haig to pay attention to this situation. At the same time, I ordered Commander Petain to reinforce the French First Army on the right wing of the British army. The content of my instruction is as follows:</p>
<p>Today, October 10, the direction of the three-way meeting of troops is as follows: (1) Belgian side, (2) along the Charleroi-Wasigny line, (3) along the Aisne-Meuse line. Because of the British army's victory, the most advantageous for offensive is the Charleroi-Wasigny line, so the battle should be carried out with all its strength. In this way, not only can we go directly to Mons and Avesnes, but we can also develop the following plan: (A) Join the attack on the Belgian side to clear the Lille area, which will be undertaken by the British army, fighting northeast between the Scheldt River and the Scarpe River. The scope of operations between the British and French armies extends to the south of Wasigny and the south of Avesnes, so that the British army's attack can develop northward.</p>
<p>(B) Join the attack on the Aisne-Meuse line, with the Selle River line, which will be undertaken by the French First Army. The first batch of reinforcements will be transferred to the First Army to help in the battle. The reinforcements that arrive later will be transferred to the Belgian side or the Aisne-Meuse line to help in the battle.</p>
<p>On October 15, the French and American armies between the Aisne River and the Argonne Forest went straight to Mézières, encountering the German army's strong defense line (Tingding斯特朗 and 布朗希爾特斯特朗 line,) which started from拉發爾, passed 克萊西西沙伏齊歐 all the way to 格倫特普爾,</p>
<p>North of the Aisne River, the British army attacked Mons Avesnes, advancing to the Wasigny·勒加篤·沙勒斯美·杜亞意 line on the same day. The army shook the Lille area from the south, and the French army group between the Lys River and the North Sea threatened from the north. The army group had reached a stable position on October 14. There is no concern about transportation. It had already resumed its offensive between Steen and Wervicq, and the situation was very favorable. The American army withdrawn from the front line had also been transferred to help in the battle. Furthermore, because the French army in that area increased, General Pousoudy was sent to serve as commander of the Sixth Army, and General De Cointet remained as the chief of staff of the Belgian king, assisting the Belgian king in commanding the battle.</p>
<p>After the French army group was supplemented in this way, it continued to attack straight to Thourout·谷特萊·和蒙明, developing rapidly, occupying賀爾特魯勒 and 摩西爾 on the 14th, attacking past谷特馬克 on the 15th, advancing to the city of 谷特萊 , attacking into蒙明 and 瓦活克, 韜樂·列希特韋爾特·亞杜意·伊斯堪 were captured one after another on the 16th. The enemy army then withdrew from the entire Belgian coast, and all coastal batteries and submarine bases that had endangered British and British-French transportation for several years were also abandoned.</p>
<p>On the 17th, the Belgian army recovered 奥斯敦, on the 19th, it recovered布倫肯堡 and 齊布魯治, on the 20th, the Belgian army advanced to the Dutch border and the希普同運河, and King Albert of Belgium was also preparing to re-enter Bruges in triumph.</p>
<p>The plan decided by the Allied Commander-in-Chief five weeks ago to "defeat the enemy army in Belgian territory and recover the lost land north of the Lys River" has now been completed by the French army group.</p>
<p>On October 22, I personally congratulated the Belgian army, and notified them to reorganize their teams, restore transportation, contact the rear, and arrange for the marines along the coast to respond, and then immediately continue to advance.</p>
<p>While the French army group was advancing between the North Sea and the Lys River, the right wing of the British army also continued to attack in the direction of Wasigny and Charleroi according to plan. On October 17, the British Fourth Army broke through the enemy's stubborn resistance and occupied勒加篤. On the 18th and 19th, it occupied Wasigny and Charleroi, driving the German army back to the east bank of the Sambre Aisne Lien River. The right wing and the British Third Army contacted and crossed the Selle River, occupying Charleroi (October 20), and advanced to蘭特勒西 and摩麻爾林邊 (October 24). On the left wing, the British Third Army cleared the south bank of the Sanshi River, attacked across the愛加宏河, and advanced to勒格斯諾 and the city of凡倫西 (October 24 and 26).</p>
<p>In the northern battle, the French army group was the left road and the right wing of the British army was the right road, advancing side by side. At the same time, the British First and Fifth Armies were responsible for the middle road, pressing the enemy army on the front, and causing the enemy army to implement a general retreat. The enemy army's front line began to retreat from the Lys River to the史家坡河 on October 17. After ten days, on October 17, our army recovered 列藜 and 杜亞意, on the 18th, it recovered 馬爾興 and 巴興, on the 20th, it recovered 特宗, on the 21st, it recovered 聖亞蒙, and on the 27th, the British army advanced to the left bank of the 希爾特河 across the entire line, and 都那義 to 凡倫西 were all recovered. The right wing of the French army group re-attacked, crossed the Lys River, occupied 谷拉義 on October 19, and immediately continued to advance to the 希爾特河, reaching the river bank between 亞夫爾 and 都那義 (October 20 to 26). The left wing and middle road of the French army group took advantage of the victory and attacked again on October 31, fighting fiercely for four days, driving the enemy army back to the right bank of the 希爾特河, and the military plan of October 10 was developed to the north of the Aisne River.</p>
<p>I was able to continue to advance the right wing army towards the common goal of Mézières on October 19, and also transfer troops to develop new targets.</p>
<p>My plan is as follows:</p>
<p>(To be continued)</p>
