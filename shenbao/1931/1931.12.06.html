<p>國際聯盟究爲何物乎爲公理與和平之保障乎抑爲强權之倀鬼乎自九一八我東北禍變爆發以來國聯之原形乃日益顯露迄至目前更捉襟見肘雖力求彌縫掩飾其虚僞之本來面目國聯發言人雖力爲狡辭辯護然而欲蓋彌彰事實上恰益以顯示其無能與無聊國際聯盟究爲何物吾人深信世界人士在今日應已獲得正確之批判</p>
<p>中國對於九一八以來日本極其横蠻無理之暴行以極誠信之態度聽從國聯之判斷今日旣已退無可退讓無可讓矣而日本之暴戾仍有增無已國聯仍爲黑暗所籠罩毫無一線光明之呈現據前日巴黎方面傳來之關於國聯理事會决議草案六項仍是敷衍遷延不痛不癢旣不肯决然予日本以嚴厲之裁制復不肯明白宣告中國遭受暴力之迫害爲應分惟以狡猾欺騙之手段處處順從日人之意志而右抑我國國聯明知此次對中日糾紛之處置爲違反會章而猶强辯謂東三省事件係屬非常性質冀以掩飾其袒强抑弱蹂躪公理與會章之行爲心勞日拙天下人耳目可以一手掩盡乎</p>
<p>所謂調查團之派遣據目前事實上所表現其内幕似亦大有文章在據巴黎方面傳來消息謂委員之人數有三人與五人之爭論而各小國與德國且各爭在調查團中占一席法國則力拒德之參加國聯方面空氣且謂如德國參加將引起某種之誤會即一向態度模稜之美國亦表示願派員參加夫調查團不過一調查事實眞相之公正人耳而各國竟演出爭奪之醜劇謂此中而無不可公開之秘密内幕謂此中而無不利於我國家之陰謀誰能信之</p>
<p>再就另一方面言調查團之工作應以絶對公正之立塲調查日軍之暴行及我東北之實在情况斷無調查我國内情形之理然而今日國聯中之空氣顯已有接受日方蠻横要求調查及我國内情形之表示對於日軍暴行之調查反有種種之限制日方要求中立區域有勦匪權國聯則認爲合理國聯主張日軍勦匪行動必須常有中立視察員監視日方則又堅决反對甚且反對調查團抵遠東時如日軍猶未撤退調查團可以報告理事會之辦法并要求有通過中立區域進兵之權就此種事實而觀則日方對於我國與國聯曲意屈從尚不滿足嗚呼世間果有公理其物耶日本今日之一意孤行吾人固已不欲置言獨足號稱維護公理與和平之國際聯盟今後其將何以取信於世界耶强權即公理之一言吾人今日於國聯之不公平之處理已獲得事實上之確證矣</p>
<p>我國對於國聯今復何望今日之事僅有二途非奮起自救即爲甘受宰割據當局近日宣示謂日不撤軍决不開始交涉並謂無論如何决不使國家領土輕易喪失尺寸全國人民都已聽取此種堅决之昭示矣政府不負國家不負人民我全國民衆亦斷不負政府當以堅决之行動爲政府之後盾。貫澈撤退日軍收回失地之主張恢復九月十八以前之我東北半壁大好山河</p>

<h3 id="c111">公媳通姦暴父挖子雙目 <a href="#c111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>世風日下倫常大變</p>
<p>楊廷臣眞老而無恥</p>
<p>竟視乃子如眼中釘</p>
<p>法院應予嚴厲懲辦</p>
<p>昨日南市二區總署轄境新橋路十四號草棚内發生翁媳通姦暴父突起很心竟將乃子用鐵練縛於木椿上以利刀挖去雙目極人間未有之慘狀幸被麗園路派出所長警覺察將其子救下暴父及帮兇當場被獲兹將詳情分述於下</p>
<p>養猪餬口楊廷臣江北阜寗人年五十二歲來滬有年初以拉車爲業近因年事衰老乃寄居於南市新橋路三十四號草棚内以養猪仔餬口楊於三十十八歲亡妻僅生一子名楊小桃子現年二十九歲役黄包車夫住居斜徐路河浜小艒艒船内妻顧氏現年三十一歲父代子職顧氏於七歲時即至楊家爲童養媳小桃子十五歲失恃十六歲即與顧氏結褵詎乃父廷臣當時以子年幼可欺加之鰥居有年竟爾獸慾衝動暗中與顧氏發生曖昧且已先其子飽嘗處女風味矣故當時兩小表面上雖已成婚而實際上乃由廷臣代理一切小桃子雖明知乃父之行爲不當然一旦聲張顧面攸關故始終隱忍而不發</p>
<p>曾控忤逆楊小桃子雖一再隱忍但其父仍欲得寸進尺視乃子如眼中釘大有不加拔除不能暢所欲爲之慨乃不惜吹毛求疵過事尋釁至本年舊歷六月間父子忽起勃谿廷臣竟具狀訴其子於地方法院控其有忤逆行爲詎當時法院方面觀察乃本天下無不是的父母之古訓將小桃子判處徒刑二月</p>
<p>商量毒計轉瞬兩月期滿至八月間出獄小桃子乃將其妻顧氏遷出另居以避乃父之鋒不料安居五十餘日廷臣竟百般設計將顧氏誘出藏匿無踪小桃子雖明知乃父所爲然亦不敢向其質問祇得鬱鬱在心拉車之暇遍往各處尋訪廷臣恐日久終必敗露心腹之患難免暴發至此惡念陡起乃與妻侄張毛鬍子（即張金奎）商得一策議决進行</p>
<p>誘往草棚前日下午五時許張金奎即往斜徐路而晤小桃子僞稱乃父廷臣見媳失踪連日亦四訪無着心甚焦急現擬偕往廷臣處商一妥善之策共同尋訪以收速効小桃子乃隨張同往詎甫入草棚廷臣即怒形於面並見同族之楊秉興（六十一歲乞丐）在座父子一言未合廷臣即命張金奎帮同將小桃子用鐵練緊縛於預先栽就之木椿上</p>
<p>竟下毒手廷臣與金奎將小桃子綑縛後兩人即對面相坐痛飮以助雅興直至夜深十一時許時已夜闌人靜小桃子見兩人形勢不佳正欲大聲呼援詎甫張口廷臣即用石灰投入喉内致小桃子欲鳴不得旣而廷臣更用修荸薺之利刀將小桃子雙目拕去復用石灰嵌入眼窩小桃子痛澈心腑呼援無門祇得聽天由命而已</p>
<p>巡官查明小桃子雙目被挖後廷臣更用言恫嚇謂須誣人謀害否則即置彼於死地云云詎料正在得意忘形之際適有二區總署麗園路派出所巡官王省三率同長警沈傳賢等巡邏經過聞得十四號棚内有慘極之呼痛聲乃入内檢查見木椿上縛一雙目被挖血跡淋漓之人不禁大駭遂將廷臣一干人等一齊拘入二區總署</p>
<p>解送法院凌區長聞得界内發生此等駭人聽聞之逆倫傷害案立即預審先由小桃子泣訴一過繼據廷臣供乃子自八月間釋出後即時有用斧害我（廷臣自稱）之言舊歷本月二十四日因長孫腹痛哭閙因之子媳發生口角媳旋逃亡無踪今同逆子歸家一時氣憤故而將其雙目挖去云云凌區長訊畢以本案案情重大當即備文一併解送法院盡法懲治</p>

<p>馬占山的研究</p>
<p>讀者諸君一致推重馬占山將軍有投書表示感激涕零者有典衣鬻產捐助餉帶者有結伴遠去願拚死命爲之援救者足見人心不死公道昭然其實馬占山將軍亦祗盡其應盡的職分身爲邊防軍事長官當然有守土抗敵之責馬將軍之大受國人崇拜祗以其處於不抵抗空氣　罩之下忽然得此愈使人歡喜贊歎幾於五體投地耳</p>
<p>吾希望讀者諸君對於馬占山勿空說幾句好話白倘幾滴熱淚至少須進一步研究下列幾個問題</p>
<p>（一）在此國難聲中何以抗敵不怕死的祇有馬占山與其部下</p>
<p>（二）究竟馬占山是何種敎育所養成</p>
<p>（三）究竟現在一般敎育是否能養成馬占山</p>
<p>吾聞馬占山並未讀過多少書識得多少字從行伍襄出身（一說是某種社會出身）升做卜級中級軍官一步步升至現職不但新敎育完全談不到連舊敎育也無多大關係吾想彼所受的敎育祇有小說罷大鼓罷戲劇罷再不然他的家鄉父老所傳下忠孝節義的故事罷而居然轟轟烈烈幹出一番爲國爭光的事業彼提倡不抵抗主義的將軍在某大學雖未畢業總是一個大學生然則現今一般名流所睡棄之舊道德舊文化該不該一拳打倒一脚踢翻怕還有不少考慮餘地</p>
<p>吾人平時所深信不疑者不是科學救國乎想到神權打破倫理廢棄今後取而代之者不是法治精神乎一般名流文字所宣傳口舌所鼓吹究其歸束不外乎此今馬占山孤軍絶域以甚少之兵額僅存之器械敵日本傾國之强兵而又四顧茫茫絶無援助以科學眼光觀之萬無倖存之理惟有屈服以圖苟全耳即以法治精神繩之有主張不抵抗之長官有拱手退讓之先例奉命而行豈得謂爲非法馬占山之所爲直是科學家邏輯所不容法治論者夢想所不到而恰受一般人祝電「爲中華喚起國魂爲民族爭回人格」之推崇然則僅僅倡科學倡法治雖非對不對的問題怕不免還有夠不夠的問題罷</p>
<p>吾知東北軍官馬占山以外尚不少馬占山其人乃至各地軍官亦尚不少馬占山其人祇受壓於一般不抵抗長官致英雖無用武成名之機會耳吾輩老百姓何嘗有私於馬占山早凖備着無限量的熱血與苦淚待輸與後起百千萬億的馬占山暴日無厭在有命好男兒好國民不乘此時立功報國更待何時我讀者通訉諸君倘一致贊許吾言乎這幾天讀者來訉除分别函復外暫停公表敬附啟</p>

<p>公認爲足球界驕子之曁南隊日前一敗於林肯甲組賽之希望减少昨又受挫於上海高級盃之前途繼絶球運欠佳藝術退化乎兩者實兼而有之也以昨日論上海隊素居於平庸球隊之列中曁南勝之雖不能易若反掌亦當措置裕如顧事實上竟見矛盾反遭二對一之慘敗且逢敵方名將辛克萊受傷缺席之秋如此良機得兹结果益令人起滄桑之感也雖然勝負家常事曁南健兒今後更宜提起勇氣努力從事於恢復令營發揮其偉大精神進而握海上之請權則此時之失敗未始不爲他日成功之母也</p>
<p>因禍得福</p>
<p>辛克萊氏上海隊之柱石因傷出場全軍震動十人作戰結果勝利實非意料所及内衛嚴密守門堅硬破之大不易事所失一球及十二碼罰球之結果非其罪也前鋒活動不多而聲色頗厲射擊亦鮮但竟有二下中的是亦難能可貴矣設或曁南而得穩妥之守門則所中二球至少可救一球充其量滿足上海隊和局之目的而已更何來逾量之凱旋乎</p>
<p>大難臨頭</p>
<p>上海撥球進展數攻不利　見劉祖侃左陲疾入傳向中央陳鎭和乘機射擊先後二下咸未命中丘東炎亦加以一脚亦仍失效繼之梅洪寳挑中劉祖侃頂違門前大起風浪曁南卒難覓隙入網三十分鐘丘東炎踢傷辛克萊腿骨倒地不起轉送醫院療治其傷重可知觀者多以丘氏氏之顰有反規律也上海隊遭此大故無暇進攻但努力於防守俾　致有所損失法平兩次救險　厥功甚巨上半時零對零</p>

<p>— 燕子</p>
<p>當甲午朝鮮變起。中日失和。仁川平壤之戰。祇聶士成一軍。曾與日軍力戰。而當時傳誦者。惟左寳貴之扼守平壤。血戰以殉。其實聶之驍勇善戰。固不亞於左。因此事平之後。葉志超衛汝貴。均以兵潰論罪。琅璫入獄。李鴻章深知聶之可靠。仍倚重之擢爲直隷提督。領武衛前軍。與董福祥袁世凱等。同爲新軍之健將。迨庚子秋。義和團起事於津沽。紅燈照大師兄輩。横行一時。路人側目。迷信之五大臣倒屣相迎。領重兵之董福祥。尤致傾倒。獨聶士成一軍。不爲所動。義和團之擾其防地者。剿殺無遺。匪類啣之甚。然亦無如之何。八國聯軍進窺津沽。聶獨率所部。扼要禦敵。其時聯軍之先鋒隊。爲日本與德國兩軍。聶不畏强敵。奮力抵抗。轉戰於楊柳靑一帶。兩宫之得以蒙塵西去者。聶之力也。團匪見聶軍禦敵。潛從背後夾擊之。聶督率所部。分兵接戰。後以彈盡援絶。全軍覆没。聶亦身中數彈。陷陣以殉。聞者惜之。嗟夫聶士成以一武夫。能知大體。不爲拳匪所惑。不爲强敵所屈。孤軍血戰。繼以身殉。較之董福祥輩之不知順逆。遺千戴臭名者。不可以道里計矣。壯哉聶士成。</p>

<h3 id="c153">戰神前之對話（五） <a href="#c153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>您說宣起戰來，中國不一定敗，這話有什麽根據呢？」</p>
<p>「日本不可以久戰。日本國内也是百孔千瘡。東三省進兵之前，日本失業人數已達一百五十萬，現在失業人數約在二百五十萬左右。東京府市一地衣食不足之細民在十二萬以上。無家可歸的人深夜在淺草一帶露宿者以千計。專門大學校畢業生找不着事做的在百分之四十左右。全國農人負債至五十萬萬日金，合華幣一百萬萬之多。對華貿易從第一位降至第五位，這兩個多月來買賣給英美佔去的在一萬五千萬以上。在這短期中現金流到美國去的將近三萬萬日金。在高橋龜吉之日本財閥之解剖及株式會社亡國論二書裏我們可以看見日本財界之腐敗及岌岌可危之活動寫眞。自從這抵制日貨發生效力以來，實業機關倒閉的不勝其數。因交通便利實業發達故勞農無產階級之組織更爲嚴密，近來進行尤猛，軍隊中時常發現秘密之煽動。天皇也不像從前那麽神聖不可侵犯。打倒天皇之標語口號是常見常聞的。日本的舊勢力是一日千里的向崩潰的路上奔走。新勢力是到處潛伏着，而且是繼長增高，好像對工舊勢力說：「彼可取而代之！」這種種情形都不許日本久戰。久戰則日本的舊勢力必崩潰。舊勢力戰到將崩潰的時候必不能再戰，不敢再戰。」</p>
<p>「日本只不利於久戰。倘一鼓而敗我全國之師。豈不糟糕？」</p>
<p>「中國出了一個馬占山，已經使日本受不了。倘若正式宣戰。徧國都是馬占山，必成久戰之局。久戰則日本舊勢力不與我議和必被新勢力打倒。」</p>
<p>「日本舊勢力推倒之後，則東亞多一共和國，中國也不寂寞了。」</p>
<p>「日本舊勢力推倒之後日本是否建立一個共和國，現在尚難逆料。但是對日宣戰不獨爲中國伸公道並且是給了日本新勢力一種很大的帮助，這是可斷言的。」</p>
<p>「中國對日宣戰曁是與日本新勢力有帮助，那麽日本的新勢力便應該諒解中國之抵抗。」</p>
<p>「中國起來抵抗，不但日本的新勢力諒解，世界各國之主張正義公道者都要鼓掌歡迎，都要站在我們的戰線上來。他們不是爲我們鼓掌，乃是爲正義公道鼓掌。如果我們向正義公道退縮，那末，全世界有志之人都要爲我們歎息，不是爲我們歎息，乃是爲正義公道歎息。」</p>
<p>「這樣看來，前途殊可樂觀。」</p>
<p>「你也不可以太樂觀丨照中國的歷史推測，這時候會出岳武穆也會在秦檜。此刻岳武穆正在與秦檜鬥法。中華民國將要不要做宋朝第二還得看這兩派人鬥法的結果咧。」</p>

<p>— 貧俠</p>
<p>雷吉生君松人也。昔曾兼任上海各著名華字日報採訪記者。與英工部局副總辦兼代理總辦麻經釀氏時相過從。縱談時事。一日恰爲星期。麻氏特命其侍役。邀君赴靜安寺路住宅會話君即驅車往。至則麻氏不遽出侍役謂總辦現正由日本敎習授日文課。請少俟。未幾。麻氏課畢出。君笑問曰。總辦旣兼英法德俄意華六國文言。猶以爲未足。故又添習日文耶。麻曰。余習華文久。甚覺日文易習。惟日文雖習之甚易日音則非經日人敎授不爲功。君復詢以自習日文。已幾閱月。曰迄今已兩月餘。日僅一小時余以爲已得門徑。儘足因應。一俟月底。即擬將日敎習辭却。又曰。日本人中多福爾摩斯一流人。若令久於其事。恐余公私秘密。不免多被其偵悉耳。麻氏言至此。又曰。余因此憶及一事。庚子一役。北京拳匪。圍攻東交民巷各使館時。各公使嚴令武員。凡界外華人。概不准溷入使館界内。因之各使館重要人物。欲覓一理髮匠不可得。嗣知界内祇有一日籍理髮匠。乃將就令其服務。彼乃往來於各使館中以爲常。嗣八國聯軍由津攻入北京。使館中人。羣見一人身穿軍服。袖章帽章。金邊燦然。策馬於旭日旗下。往來如飛者。即迭在各使館中爲人理髮之日人也。始知日人作此賤役。實具隱謀。不但欲探中國軍情。并欲剌探各使館機密也余於日人。故深畏之云。</p>

<p>— 劉海粟</p>
<p>他是用了這樣的熱誠。這是火一般的熱心來勉勵朋友看了這封信，不論是誰。對於志摩的眞的人是歷歷可見的。因爲他的爲人是這樣。纔成爲中國數一數二的新詩人。</p>
<p>我此次歸國就滿想與志摩抵掌叙一叙闊别。我在巴黎動身之前接到他的來信。知道他也有同樣的渴望。他並且願在上海等我。</p>
<p>我到滬的明天。午前十點鐘便到福煦路志摩家去。剛進門。他的僕人就對我說。</p>
<p>「劉先生你回來了嗎。姑爺剛於昨天上北平去。」</p>
<p>我一言不發。悵然如有所失。當晚就在滄洲旅館草草的寫了一封信給他。告訴他我回來了。你何以慰我。</p>
<p>大約過了六天以後吧。就接到他一封航空寄來的信。</p>
<p>「海粟。</p>
<p>我計程你遲至十五總可到。我延到十七動身。你還没有消息。我想你一定是在南方躭擱了。結果我走你到。幾年别緒　曾叙得。悵惘之至。到此後曾函洵美問起你到否。亦未得復。昨晚函來。至使欣慰。海翁此行。所得當可比玄獎之於西土。帶回寳物定然纍纍。久居國内。竟成聾瞶。但盼海翁歸來抵掌暢談。不意又復相左。嫂子想一同回來。少爺呢。北方尚鎭靜。你能來否。也許不久我想兩下一次。順便看你的傑作。」</p>
<p>那時候我正要上南京去。所以没有再寫信給他。我從南京回滬大約在十天以後吧。有一次我在志摩家聽說他將要南來。此後。我就每天期待着他。</p>
<p>十一月十四日那天我本想下午到杭州去。正在午餐時候。志摩來了。他一面上扶梯一面大聲感道。</p>
<p>「海粟。海棠。你好嗎。我來看你的寳物了。」</p>
<p>我眞没法形容我那在快樂的神奇的啟示中的渾身的震盪。諺云。得一知己。終身無憾。志摩就是我終身的一個知己。尤其是對於我的畫。</p>
<p>他走進畫室。就一張一張地细看着我的新作。大約看了二十幾張以後。他就坐在沙發上。充滿着兩頰發燒那樣神氣。深深地說。</p>
<p>「這樣才是畫。看了才過癮。海粟你的力量已經到了畫面之外。你站住了現在你是」</p>
<p>。不是中國的人了。可憐中國云何談藝。人才太少。但是有一人也夠了……」</p>
<p>以後。又大談其巴黎。顯着滿足希望的臉色。他也講了各樣的話我正想留他吃飯。</p>
<p>基請他吃飯。吃過飯再來詳細復看幾遍。</p>
<p>大約三點多鐘吧。他又用他天生的銀一般澄徹的聲音。一直喊上樓來。將一隻大手一把拉住我。使我重復感到無量的温情。</p>

<p>可是有什麽用呢。徒自憤恨。血肉之軀怎敵無情的槍彈。那麽駐防的國軍在那裏呢。爲什麽不見動靜啊。至於在城外的居民。更是驚慌得走頭無路流彈嗤嗤地在屋上飛過。性命就在眼前。任何人的生死。至此也難决定了有些胆大的明知太陽國已發了動員令。公然放出他們的獸行來。但不知道他們究竟攻打什麽。便悄悄地就樓上窺探。見南邊紅光一冒。接着一聲砲響。打到北邊去。緊接着機關槍的聲音。原來太陽國人正在攻打我們的北大營</p>
<p>隆隆隆。大砲的聲音接連響過後。太陽國的軍隊在砲火掩護之下。向</p>
<p>但是對面却很沉寂。並没有一槍還擊。兇很而狡猾的太陽軍還怕中人詭</p>
<p>以不斷地槍砲儘放過去。造成恐怖的局面。而他們却如入無人之境。發展</p>
<p>淫威。實施他們的計劃。本來太陽國人在我們東北地方。視我國如無人。禁臠。早已囊括在手掌之中。以遂他們席捲三省的野心。今番的舉動。一切佈置妥定先發制人。好滿足他們的侵略慾了。</p>
<p>唉。這是一個很奇怪的問題。兩國相戰。旗鼓堂皇。自有一定的步驟。斷没有不告而戰。偷偷掩掩的動手。這不是類于盗匪的行經麽。兵法上雖有出其不意攻其無備的策略。可是終在雙方宣戰以後。各出奇兵以决勝負的。斷無文明國人而出於這種土匪狗盗的舉動啊。但是太陽國人的性情。本來如此。他好趁此殺一個痛快。給人家措手不及。放出他們的手段來了。太陽國人和我們究竟結了什麽仇恨呢。照理論上說。彼此同文同種。又是同洲。理當互相携手。共謀兩國人民的幸福。</p>

The Administrative Council is Scheduled to Meet at 4:00 PM Today to Discuss This Matter. (5th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Meeting Between the Drafting Committee and Ito Ended at 12:30 PM Without Reaching an Agreement. Ito is Now Requesting Instructions from the Japanese Delegation. The Drafting Committee Will Discuss Everything with the Administrative Council This Afternoon. The Main Difficulty Now Lies in the Chairman's Critical Interpretation of the Bandit Suppression Plan, the So-Called Introduction. It is Reported that the Committee is Now Firmly Committed to the Investigation Committee's Plan and is More Determined Than Previously Expected. If This Requires Further Communication with Tokyo, Progress Will Inevitably be Delayed Again. Furthermore, the Chinese Delegation Has Not Expressed Any Intention to Withdraw Troops from Jinzhou, Which Also Makes the Discussion of the Incident More Difficult. However, This Issue Was Not Discussed This Morning. Only Dr. Shih Submitted a Memorandum, Revealing That China Wants the Neutral Zone to Start East of Jinzhou Instead of at the Great Wall, So That Jinzhou Remains in Chinese Control. This is the Situation on the 20th Day of the League of Nations Administrative Council's 83rd Meeting. Therefore, the Future Does Not Seem to Hold Much Optimism. (5th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Administrative Council Was Very Active This Afternoon. Initial Discussions Moved Towards a Resolution of the Manchurian Issue. After Several Meetings and Discussions, and After One Meeting of the Administrative Council, It Was Learned That the Observation Points of Both China and Japan Have Not Yet Approached Each Other More Closely Than Before. In Reality, Yoshizawa and Shih Chao-chi Visited Briand One After Another. Yoshizawa Has Not Yet Received the Full Text of the Instructions Issued by Tokyo, But He Explained to Briand Japan's Position on Paragraph 5 of the League of Nations Resolution Regarding the Organization of the Investigation Committee and Its Views on the Introduction to the Resolution, Stating That the Investigation Committee Must Not Be Linked to the General Issue of the Withdrawal of Japanese Troops from Manchuria or the Deadline for Withdrawal. Yoshizawa Said That Japan Abides by the Administrative Council's Resolution of September 30 on This Type of Incident. Yoshizawa Referred to the Introductory Recommendation to Slightly Modify the Language of "Having the Right to Adopt Police Plans to Combat Banditry" So That Japan Can Accept It. Dr. Shih Received Two Long Telegrams from Nanjing, Allowing Him to Explain the Chinese Perspective to Briand in Detail, But Dr. Shih Did Not Hand Over Any Documents. It is Reported that Dr. Shih Also Explained the Status of Jinzhou. The Administrative Council Met at 6:00 PM Tonight and Adjourned After Two Hours. Briand Informed the Members of His Talks with Yoshizawa, and League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond Also Notified the Members of the Information He Obtained from Dr. Shih. Most of This Information Was About the Negotiations Between Chinese Foreign Minister Koo and Other Key Figures in the Nanjing Government Regarding the Status of Jinzhou. Japan's Reply to the Administrative Council's Proposal Has Not Yet Been Received in Full, So the Administrative Council Only Discussed the Situation in Jinzhou. It is Reported That There Are Rumors of Renewed Military Action, Which Have Not Yet Been Confirmed. The Original Text of Japan's Reply to the League of Nations Resolution is Expected to Arrive Before the Administrative Council Meeting at 11:00 AM on the 5th for Discussion. However, in Any Case, the Administrative Council Has Decided to Hold a Meeting of the 12 Members at 11:00 AM on the 5th. It is Reported That the Japanese Representatives Are Prepared to Accept the Existing Resolution, But With the Reservation of Making Any Amendments According to the Tokyo Reply. After the Administrative Council Meeting Tonight, the Drafting Committee Gathered in the Secretary-General's Office to Formulate Questions That Will Be Cabled to Tokyo Tonight, Asking for a Point-by-Point Explanation of Several Points Related to Bandit Suppression and Police Plans and Related to Japan's Proposal to Demarcate the Boundaries of the Neutral Zone. It is Hoped That the Reply to These Questions Can Arrive in Paris Before the Meeting on the 5th. (4th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) Today, the League of Nations Council is Temporarily at a Standstill, Awaiting the Replies from China and Japan to the Draft Resolution of the Council. It is Reported That the British, American, and French Ambassadors to Japan Have Been Ordered to Inquire with the Japanese Government About the True Attitude Towards the Proposal of a Neutral Zone in Jinzhou on Behalf of the Council. It is Reported That the Drafting Committee of the Council is Now Asking Dr. Shih Chao-chi to Further Clarify China's Attitude Towards the Neutral Zone in Jinzhou and to Explain Whether China is Willing for Minister Koo Wei-chun to Negotiate Directly with Japanese Envoy Shigemitsu and the Extent and Scope of What it is Willing to Negotiate. Dr. Shih Has Not Yet Gone to Explain Because He is Awaiting Instructions from the Government. (4th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) Today, All Activities Are Concentrated on How to Define the Boundaries of the Neutral Zone and How to Implement Administration and Policing Within the Neutral Zone. In the Afternoon, Yoshizawa and Briand Met for a Long Time Because of This. Shih Chao-chi Then Met with the Secretary-General of the League of Nations and Submitted a Note. This Note Explained China's Position on Matters Such as the Withdrawal of Troops to Within the Great Wall and the Implementation of Policing Within the Neutral Zone. The Nanjing Side's Stance on These Matters is Well Known and Has Not Changed in Any Way. It Acknowledges Some Necessary Formalities for the Neutral Zone Being Attached to Japan and Reiterates This. When the Twelve-Member Committee Met, China and Japan Again Had Differences. At This Time, Japan's Intention Was That All Matters Related to the Neutral Zone Should Be Debated Directly Between China and Japan Outside of the League of Nations. The Executive Yuan Believes That This Move is "Another Evasive Act in Diplomacy, Which is Actually Making Unnecessary Complications," and Decided to Telegram the Japanese Foreign Minister at Night, Asking Him to State Japan's Views on the Neutral Zone Issue in Clear and Definite Terms. This Action by the Executive Yuan is Extremely Important Because It Negotiates Directly with the Japanese Government Without Going Through the Japanese Delegation, Which Shows That There Has Been a Major Change in Procedures. The Unhappiness of Senior Officials in the League of Nations, At Least Considered Impatience, is Also Expressed Here. (4th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) Today, at the Meeting of the Twelve-Member Committee This Afternoon, It Was Decided to Submit Several Questions to the Japanese Government. The Drafting Committee Then Met From 8:00 PM to 8:45 PM, and Prepared the Documents to Be Cabled to Tokyo That Evening. According to What This Agency Knows, the Executive Yuan is Asking Japan to Explain About Two Points: (1) The Extent to Which the Japanese Government Wants to Take Police Action in Manchuria to Suppress Bandits; (2) The Demarcation of the Boundaries of the Neutral Zone and Its Width. This Second Point Seems to Occupy the Main Part of the Document. (4th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the Draft Resolution, the Japanese Representatives Have Received Instructions. Except for Minor Differences Regarding the Powers of the Investigation Committee in Section 5, Japan is Willing to Accept It. As for Briand's Declaration, the Japanese Representatives Have Not Yet Received Instructions, But Have Received a Declaration That They Plan to Issue Before Accepting the Resolution, Which Will Explain Japan's General Policy in Manchuria and Its Views on the League of Nations' Handling of the Manchurian Incident. (4th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) This Morning, Marquis Ito Delivered the Japanese Reply to the Draft Resolution and the Text of the Chairman's Declaration to Briand. According to the Draft Resolution, If the Withdrawal of Troops Has Not Yet Begun When the Investigation Committee Arrives on Another Day, Then the Committee Should Immediately Submit a Report on the Issue of Troop Withdrawal. The Japanese Government Has Raised Objections to This Clause. As for the Issue of Bandit Suppression, Ito Requested That It Not Be Mentioned in the Resolution, But Be Included in the Declaration. Overall, Among the Difficulties Raised by the Japanese Government, There Are Important Relationships, But a Final Compromise is Still Possible. Student Demonstrations at Peking University in Peking Cause Conflicts, the National Government Orders a Prohibition on Group Petitions, Military Attaches from Various Countries Go to Shanhaiguan for Inspection, Shih Chao-chi and Wellington Koo Both Offer Resignations, the Fourth Plenary Session of the Guangdong Provincial Congress Concludes (See Domestic Important Telegrams), a New Government is Established in Lithuania (See Foreign Important Telegrams), Students from the Capital Welcome Representative Wang to Shanghai (See Local News)</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>Disappointment, Japan's Reply Regarding the Neutral Zone Has Not Yet Been Received, and the Executive Yuan Also Eagerly Awaits China's Answer. According to What This Agency Knows, China's Intention is That There is Already a Neutral Zone Between Jinzhou and Shenyang, So There is No Need for Chinese Troops to Withdraw from Jinzhou. This Kind of Claim is Not Necessarily Agreed to by Japan. According to Well-Informed Sources, Japan Definitely Wants Chinese Troops to Withdraw Completely. If This Demand is Not Met, It Will Definitely Enforce It. It Seems That If Chinese Troops Withdraw, It Will Help the Executive Yuan Discuss the Outcome of the Incident. Although This Method is Not Very Good, It Can Avoid Future Incidents and is Also an Inevitable Measure. While Diplomatic Work is Slowly Progressing to Completely Resolve the Dispute, All Incidents Should Not Be Allowed to Happen. (5th Havas Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) As a Result of Careful Deliberation on the League of Nations Draft Resolution and the Chairman's Draft Declaration Solicited by Yoshizawa, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Decided to Issue a Final Instruction Telegram to Yoshizawa at 4:00 PM on the Afternoon of the 4th Regarding the Amendment Clauses Requested by Japan. The Content is as Follows: (1) The Entire Section of Paragraph 5 of the Resolution Stating, "If the Two Parties, China and Japan, Have Not Yet Implemented the Pledges of the Council Resolution of September 30 When the Investigation Committee Arrives in Dong Province, Then the Committee Must Report to the Council as Soon as Possible," is Removed. (2) All of Section A of Paragraph 2 of the Draft Resolution is Amended to Adopt the Original Text of Japan's Reservation Request, Which Reads, "The Military Actions Implemented by Japan to Protect the Lives and Property of Japanese Residents in Response to the Activities of Bandits and Undesirable Elements are Not Included in This Example." The Above Two Requests are Japan's Final Opinion and There is Absolutely No Concession. If the League of Nations Council Can Acknowledge This Point, Then Yoshizawa Will No Longer Need to Solicit Instructions from the Government. (5th Japan League Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Bess, the President of the American United Press, Returned to Beiping After Inspecting Shenyang. According to What He Said, the Japanese Troops Are Determined to Expel the Chinese Troops Between Shanhaiguan and Jinzhou. If They Cannot Do So Through Diplomatic Means, They Will Resort to Force. The Japanese Side Claims That the Jinzhou Government and Chinese Troops Are Obstacles to Restoring Order in Manchuria. This Kind of Situation is Absolutely Intolerable to Japan. Honjo's Words About the Situation in Tianjin in Shenyang Were Extremely Exaggerated. (5th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A Spokesperson for the Japanese Officialdom Said Today That If the Chinese Think That After the Japanese Troops Withdraw Eastward, There is No Longer a Need for Chinese Troops to Withdraw Westward, Then They Are Greatly Mistaken. It is Rumored That Nanjing Has Rejected the Proposal to Establish a Neutral Zone. If So, This is Feared That It Will Have a Very Unfortunate Impact on the Japanese Authorities. The Japanese Troops Who Had Already Set Off for Jinzhou on November 27 Withdrew to Shenyang Because the Chinese Had Voluntarily Undertaken to Withdraw Their Troops into the Pass. Now, Rejecting the Establishment of a Neutral Zone is Proof That China Has Broken Its Promise. If China Does Not Fulfill Its Agreement, He Does Not Believe That the Japanese Government Can Stop the Actions of the Japanese Troops. (5th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e13">Our Final Understanding of the League of Nations <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>What exactly is the League of Nations? Is it a guarantor of justice and peace, or is it an accomplice of the powerful? Since the outbreak of the September 18th Incident in our Northeast, the true form of the League of Nations has become increasingly clear. Up to now, it is even more stretched and tries its best to make up for and cover up its hypocritical nature. Although the spokespersons of the League of Nations try their best to quibble and defend themselves, the more they try to hide, the more obvious it becomes. In fact, it only shows its incompetence and boredom. What exactly is the League of Nations? We firmly believe that people around the world should have obtained a correct critique today.</p>
<p>China has listened to the judgment of the League of Nations with the utmost sincerity in the face of Japan's extremely barbaric and unreasonable atrocities since the September 18th Incident. Today, it has retreated and conceded as much as it can, but Japan's brutality has increased unabated. The League of Nations is still shrouded in darkness and there is no ray of light. According to the report from Paris the day before yesterday regarding the six draft resolutions of the League of Nations Council, they are still perfunctory, procrastinating, and neither decisive nor effective. It is neither willing to decisively impose severe sanctions on Japan, nor is it willing to clearly declare that China has been subjected to violence. It only uses cunning and deceptive means to obey the will of the Japanese in every way, while suppressing our country. The League of Nations knows that this handling of the Sino-Japanese dispute violates the charter, but it still strongly argues that the Dongsan Province incident is of an extraordinary nature, hoping to cover up its actions of favoring the strong and suppressing the weak, trampling on justice and the charter. The effort is futile. Can the eyes and ears of the world be covered by one hand?</p>
<p>According to the current facts, the inside story of the so-called dispatch of an investigation team seems to be very important. According to news from Paris, there is a dispute over the number of members of the committee, whether it should be three or five, and the small countries and Germany are all competing to occupy a seat on the investigation team. France strongly rejects Germany's participation. The atmosphere of the League of Nations even says that if Germany participates, it will cause some kind of misunderstanding. Even the United States, which has always been ambiguous, has expressed its willingness to send personnel to participate. The investigation team is just a fair person investigating the truth, but the countries are actually staging an ugly drama of competition. Who can believe that there are no secrets that cannot be made public, that there are no conspiracies that are unfavorable to our country?</p>
<p>On the other hand, the work of the investigation team should be based on an absolutely fair position to investigate the atrocities of the Japanese army and the real situation in our Northeast. There is absolutely no reason to investigate the situation in our country. However, today, the atmosphere in the League of Nations clearly shows that it has accepted Japan's barbaric demands to investigate the situation in our country, and there are various restrictions on the investigation of the atrocities of the Japanese army. The Japanese side requires that the neutral zone have the power to suppress bandits, and the League of Nations considers it reasonable. The League of Nations advocates that the Japanese army's bandit suppression operations must be constantly monitored by neutral observers, but the Japanese side firmly opposes it. It even opposes the method of the investigation team reporting to the Council if the Japanese army has not yet withdrawn when the investigation team arrives in the Far East, and demands the right to pass through the neutral zone to send troops. Judging from this kind of fact, the Japanese side is not satisfied with deliberately complying with our country and the League of Nations. Alas, is there really such a thing as justice in the world? We have not wanted to say anything about Japan's insistence on going its own way today. Only the League of Nations, which claims to safeguard justice and peace, what will it use to gain the trust of the world in the future? The saying that might makes right, we have obtained factual confirmation of the unfair handling of the League of Nations today.</p>
<p>What hope does our country have for the League of Nations now? Today, there are only two ways: either rise up to save ourselves or be willing to be slaughtered. According to recent declarations by the authorities, they will never start negotiations if the Japanese do not withdraw their troops, and they will never easily lose an inch of national territory. All the people of the country have heard this firm announcement. The government will not betray the country or the people. The people of our country will never betray the government and will use resolute action to be the government's backing. Implement the claim to withdraw Japanese troops and recover lost territory, and restore the beautiful mountains and rivers of our Northeast, which were halved before September 18th.</p>

Although It is Stated That the Troops are Only Being Sent to Suppress Bandits, It is Widely Believed That There is a Possibility of Conflict with Chinese Troops. It is Reported That Many Places West of Shenyang That Have Recently Been Given Up by Japanese Troops Have Been Occupied by Chinese Troops. A Large Number of Chinese Troops Are Now Gathering in Dahushan and Goubangzi, and a Detachment is Stationed Along the West Bank of the Liao River. As for the Japanese Troops, They Have Retreated to the Areas East of the Liao River.

<p>(Paris) This Morning, the French Media Believed That the Only Pleasing News About the Dongsan Province Incident Obtained Yesterday Was the Official Denial by the Japanese That They Had Issued a Collection of Chinese Troops in Jinzhou to Attack the Japanese Army. Otherwise, There Was Absolutely No Progress. The Councillors Also Showed Impatience and Irritation Because of the Repeated Rotation of the Case. If the Paris Morning News Claims That Each Councillor is Working Hard and Still Has No Progress. This Kind of Situation Not Only Cannot Increase the Hope of Early Reconciliation, but Also Fears That Unfortunate Consequences Will Arise From This. Several Other Newspapers, While Worrying About Its Delay, Reverse to Speak Up for the Japanese. For Example, the Paris Echo Claims That Japan is a Strong General Against Soviet Russian Infringement. France Should Help Japan for This Reason and for Suppressing the Revolutions in the Colonies. However, the People's News of the Socialist Party Published an Article by Socialist Party Member Fohr, Explaining the Reasons for the Paris Echo's Bias Towards Japan, Saying That Japan, in Order to Launch a Conspiracy in Dongsan Province, Ordered a Large Number of Bullets and Military Supplies from the Famous French Military Equipment Company Schneider Creuzot Company. When the Contract Was Signed, the Japanese Representatives Made a Covenant to Transfer French Public Opinion to Make It Biased Towards Japan. Therefore, the Schneider Creuzot Company Specifically Established an Agency to Transfer French Public Opinion. The Paris Echo Has Close Ties with the Business Community, So It is Particularly Biased Towards Japan. The Above Two Kinds of Records Are Also Enough to Know a Part of the Reasons for the French Bias Towards Japan This Time. (5th National News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The National Government issued an order on the 5th prohibiting assembled petitions to the capital. The original order states: "Since the September 18th Incident in Shenyang, people from all over the country have been moved by righteous indignation and have come to the capital to petition, especially students from various schools. The spirit of patriotism is commendable, but the appropriateness of actions is related to survival. Now, several thousand young students gather in the capital to express their enthusiasm, sacrificing their time and wasting their studies, which is already regrettable. Moreover, in the name of petitioning, they forcibly occupy trains, drive away passengers, even beat stationmasters, destroy railway bureaus, violate national laws, and disrupt transportation administration. After arriving in the capital, they often make statements and actions that exceed the boundaries, causing public anxiety and social unrest. In addition, the diplomatic situation is urgent and changes rapidly. Government personnel work day and night, fearing negligence. However, receiving petitioning groups consumes energy and hinders important government affairs. All of this can turn a patriotic movement into a country-harming result, which is also what true patriotic citizens cannot bear. It is the intention of the people to petition the government only to express opinions and request adoption. Therefore, it is specifically and clearly ordered that, hereafter, no matter what organization, if it has opinions to present to the government, it should submit a written petition to the local administrative organ or school principal for forwarding. If there are truly feasible and commendable plans, the government will undoubtedly adopt them. The act of gathering in the capital to petition should be uniformly prohibited to avoid wasting studies and harming the country. Provincial and municipal officials, school principals, and responsible personnel of transportation organs should especially understand this purpose and strictly dissuade petitioning groups. All of us should know that, at this time of national crisis, only national unity, trust in the government, and support for the government can resist foreign aggression and save the country. Let us all be of one heart and mind, share this purpose, and fulfill our patriotic duty as citizens. This is the order." (5th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Because students from all over the country continue to petition in the capital, and recently there have been so-called demonstration groups, the National Government convened Yu Youren and Education Minister Li Shuhua at 3:00 PM on the 5th to discuss measures. (5th dispatch)</p>

Afterwards, the Ministry of Education telegraphed the central government's diplomatic policy to all secondary schools and above to clarify the truth. (5th dispatch)</p>

<p>Zhongda Students Rush into Garrison Headquarters; Zhu Jiahe Has Resigned (Nanjing) Although the Beida southward demonstration group was previously notified and advised by the garrison headquarters to cease activities, the group still refused to listen. At about 11:00 AM on the 5th, more than 300 students from the group, holding red flags with reactionary slogans, marched in demonstration from the Central University gymnasium. Along the way, they shouted reactionary slogans such as "Oppose the government selling out the Northeast Provinces," "Down with the traitorous government," and "Oppressed masses unite." Several people shouted the slogan "The national proletariat should rise up in revolt" and distributed reactionary leaflets along the way, the content of which was the same as that seized by the garrison headquarters on the 4th. When they reached Chengxian Street Floating Bridge, the guards came out to stop them. The patrol team of the garrison headquarters arrived and also tried to stop them. While negotiating with the group's commander, Yue Zengyu, some students in the team shouted "Fight!" and rushed forward, causing chaos. They attacked the police and officers with fists and feet. On the police side, the injured included squad leader Zhu Yu, platoon leader Liu Ying, and seven other police officers who were punched in the chest and back. Qin Fuxiang, a military policeman from the garrison headquarters, was seriously injured. The police then sent the students involved in the violence from the demonstration group to Xiaolingwei for resettlement in three buses, totaling 185 people, including 32 female students. At that time, some of the students in the demonstration group returned to Zhongda. When Zhongda students left class and saw the situation, they mistakenly believed that the police had arrested the students and also joined in the protest, causing a conflict with the police outside the school gate. In the chaos, one police officer was injured in the head by a stone, and several platoon leaders and police officers were detained by the students. The students sent to Xiaolingwei were temporarily settled, and they were prohibited from leaving, but food and drink were provided as usual. It is said that the authorities have urgently telegraphed the president of Peking University, Jiang Menglin, to come to Nanjing to investigate and bring them back to the original school in Beiping. It is also reported that some of the participants in the Beida demonstration group were not Peking University students, making the situation very complicated. Although the authorities had been prepared, the police officers dispatched were ordered not to carry weapons. (5th dispatch from Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At Central University on the 5th, more than ten students suddenly issued a notice in their names, calling for a general meeting to address the diplomatic issue and the reorganization of the Zhongda Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, demanding that President Zhu suspend classes. President Zhu did not allow it. At about 11:00 AM, the Beida demonstration group went out to demonstrate. The front team passed through Chengxian Street near the floating bridge and got into a fight with the military police. The police sent some of them to Xiaolingwei. A part of the rear team retreated into the Second Dormitory of Zhongda and then retreated back to Zhongda. The police followed behind. At that time, Zhongda was dismissing classes. Two students stepped forward to watch, causing a conflict. They then returned to the school and rang the bell to convene a general meeting. At about 1:00 PM, a meeting was held at the school and the following was decided: (1) Support Beida (2) Oppose the government's suppression of the people's movement (3) General strike. At that time, students from Jinling University attended the meeting to report on the situation of petitioning to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and requested assistance. Some students then went to the president's office to collect the school flag and prepared to gather and depart. They happened to meet Secretary-General Guo Xinshong. After a few words, they went forward and beat Guo, causing his head to bleed (sent to Gulou Hospital). Then, the students went to the General Affairs Office, wrote the "Zhongda Demonstration Group" flag, gathered hundreds of people, and set off to march. The slogans shouted on the road were roughly the same as those of the Beida demonstration group. They shouted slogans loudly in front of the National Government and continued to advance to Taiping Road and other places to march. Finally, the crowd rushed to the Garrison Headquarters and demanded four points from the Garrison Headquarters: (1) Release the Beida demonstration group students in Xiaolingwei (2) Apologize to Central University (3) Compensate the students for the losses (4) Release Yang Deqiao (Yang Deqiao was arrested on October 9). At that time, Garrison Commander Gu Zhenglun was not in the department. The Secretary-General came out to explain. The students insisted that they would not retreat unless they received a satisfactory answer and questioned on whose orders the Garrison Headquarters was acting. The Garrison Headquarters replied that maintaining public order was a matter of course. Finally, the students rushed into the gate of the Garrison Headquarters until 10:00 PM before they retreated. (5th dispatch from Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Li Jinde, Inspector General of the Nanjing Police Department, reported the situation of students beating police officers and police on the 5th, as follows: "For reporting purposes, at 10:00 AM on the 5th, inspectors, investigators, and patrols were dispatched to cooperate with security team officers and police in Dashi Shu, Sipaifang, Chengxian Street, and the National Government area to persuade the Beida demonstration group not to demonstrate on the streets, fearing that the public would misunderstand the word 'demonstration.' At 12:00 PM, more than 300 members of the group from the Zhongda Gymnasium emerged from the main gate and the east side gate of Zhongda and shouted slogans. Inspectors and others stepped forward to peacefully dissuade them, requesting them not to go out, fearing that the public would misunderstand the word 'demonstration.' However, the demonstration group not only did not listen to the advice but shouted 'Fight!' and hundreds of people rushed forward, injuring nine police officers and police. They attacked the officers and police with fists and feet. At that time, they had no choice but to send the Beida demonstration group who committed the violence to Xiaolingwei. When Zhongda students went out for lunch, they mistakenly thought the police were arresting students and joined the conflict. After the officers and police repeatedly explained that it was specifically to stop the Beida demonstration and had nothing to do with Zhongda, many people were talking at once, and two of the department's liaison officers and eight police officers were detained, and their whereabouts are unknown." (5th dispatch from Central News Agency)</p>

<p>Preparation to Reimpose Gold Embargo</p>
<p>Interior Minister Adachi Visits Saionji</p>
<p>Rumors of Cabinet Reorganization Abound</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 5th - Japan suddenly purchased British currency extensively today, seemingly due to expectations that Japan will soon reimpose restrictions on cash exports. The basis for this speculation cannot be determined for the time being. However, it is known that Interior Minister Adachi still firmly believes in the necessity of restricting cash exports. Although Finance Minister Inoue strongly opposes it, he has ultimately failed to change Adachi's opinion. The Interior Minister's visit to Elder Saionji today has further fueled speculation about changes in financial policy. However, the rumor of an impending cabinet reorganization is not generally believed. It is reported that the Interior Minister made a statement last month advocating for the formation of a national government to address the current severe financial and diplomatic difficulties. After exchanging opinions with Prime Minister Wakatsuki, both agreed that the plan to form a national government was sound in principle but difficult to implement in the current political environment, so the plan was temporarily shelved. Now, the Interior Minister's visit to Saionji has given rise to various speculations again. At the same time, the outflow of Japanese cash continues unabated. Another batch of 3.5 million yuan was shipped to the United States today. In recent weeks, each time cash was exported, there was a declaration that it was the last batch, but in fact, the outflow of cash has gradually increased. Since October 1, the total amount of Japanese cash exports is approximately 30 million yuan.</p>
<p>[Gandhi's Life in England]</p>
<p>Maintaining Tranquility and Unchanging Habits</p>
<p>Respected by Londoners</p>
<p>National News, London, 5th - Indian National Congress leader Gandhi bid farewell to England today but will travel to Europe before returning home. Gandhi left London at 9:00 AM this morning, appearing very tired due to suffering from a severe cold for several days. He delivered several speeches at the Round Table Conference, mostly criticizing the British government, but in a very peaceful manner, making listeners aware of his great dissatisfaction with the British government's treatment of India. During the two weeks of meetings of the Minorities Committee, Gandhi made every effort to seek a resolution, but without success. Gandhi still worked tirelessly day and night, contacting representatives from all sides. Gandhi also spoke with people from all walks of life in England - unemployed workers in Lancashire, factory owners, politicians, and propagandists - to understand British opinions on India and to make everyone aware of his vision for India's future. During this time, he stayed in a small hotel in the East End. Every morning from 6:30 AM to 7:30 AM, he would walk for an hour. Men, women, and children on the way would greet him, and he would smile in response. Some would even open their bedroom windows to say good morning. Gandhi would go to the office of the India Conciliation Group at the Lovejoy Bridge in the West End to meet with Indian friends and conference representatives. It was only a few dozen steps from St. James's Palace. During this time, Gandhi did not change his habits, but due to the poor climate in London, he only added a blanket around himself. As for food, he still consumed fresh fruits, dried fruits, and goat's milk. Gandhi would travel at the end of each week, never wasting a moment. At night, he would spread a thin mat on the floor and sleep for an average of less than four hours. Sometimes, he would return to his residence after midnight, but he would still spin yarn for half an hour before going to bed, never breaking his rule of spinning yarn for at least half an hour each day. Gandhi would wake up early, usually between 4:15 AM and 4:30 AM, and recite prayers. Before walking at 6:30 AM, he rarely rested. After finishing his walk at 7:30 AM, he would meet with guests. While having his simple breakfast in the bedroom, there would always be at least one guest sitting by his side. Sometimes, if the guests were impatient, he would invite them to walk with him and talk as they walked. However, usually, his devout follower, Miss Lester, would accompany him on his walk. When traveling by car from his residence to Lovejoy Bridge or St. James's Palace, a journey of about 20 minutes, Gandhi would often doze off in the car, as he was able to doze off anytime, anywhere to refresh himself. Monday was Gandhi's day of silence, a lifelong practice that he never neglected. If there was an important meeting on Monday afternoon, he would start his silence early on Sunday afternoon to complete the 24-hour period. Since arriving in Folkestone on September 12, although he was sometimes ridiculed, even when walking in the streets of London, his clothes would often attract laughter. Yet, Gandhi always had a gentle expression, leaving almost everyone who came into contact with him with a good impression. Gandhi met no fewer than several thousand people in England. Although their political views differed greatly, all admired his sincerity and simplicity and treated him with respect. Although his clothing was peculiar, he never appeared vulgar or eccentric in public or in any environment. Even in the magnificent meeting rooms of St. James's Palace, he appeared refined, or in the well-appointed reception rooms among guests in elaborate attire, he never seemed out of place. During his time in London, he only attended two public banquets: a fruit banquet held jointly by the Independent Labour Party and Gandhi, and a vegetable and fruit banquet held by the London American Correspondents. At the banquets, Gandhi only ate a few pieces of fruit and drank a little goat's milk prepared by Miss Mirabehn. Although he was repeatedly forced to attend receptions, he never attended any formal dinners. Now that Gandhi has left England, those who feel most relieved should be the eight London policemen and two or three detectives from Scotland Yard. When Gandhi resided at Kingsley Hall, there were five policemen on guard outside every night, and three others were assigned during the day. These eight men were on duty every day, rarely changing. Whenever Gandhi went anywhere, two or three detectives would take care of him, either going ahead or following behind. However, such thorough protection by the British authorities was only a sign of respect. The British people all respected him too much to even think of offending him.</p>

<p>The Selangor Klang Chinese General Chamber of Commerce cables all newspaper offices, schools, groups, and people of all circles across the country: The Japanese army forcibly occupies the Northeast and uses thugs to disturb Tianjin, with the ambition of annexing the entire country. Our government is becoming increasingly weak and has even proposed the suicidal policy of using Jinzhou as a buffer zone. After this, it is feared that the Japanese will also recognize the freedom to suppress bandits in the Northeast and directly negotiate when the troops are at the city. It is expected that this is what the authorities are happy to do. Overseas Chinese living in foreign lands feel indignant and do not want to live. We hope that the people of the country will rise up and seriously monitor the shameless actions of the government so that the Cao Zhangxian national betrayal will not be repeated under the rule of the Party. With tears in our eyes, we send this urgent telegram, hoping for your attention. The entire Chinese community of Selangor Klang bows.</p>

<p>Using the Pretext of Suppressing Local Bandits and Dispersed Soldiers</p>
<p>Zhao Xinbo Opens Large-Scale Opium Dens and Gambling Houses in Shenyang</p>
<p>Japanese Attempt to Transport Bombs to Harbin Foiled</p>
<p>Great American Evening News, Shenyang, 4th - It is reported that because the British reported that there were no Chinese troops near the Beining Railway, the Japanese army has recently made a big propaganda, claiming how many Chinese troops there are between Jinzhou and Shenyang, how rampant the scattered soldiers and bandits are along the South Manchurian Railway line, and that it was obtained by their aircraft reconnaissance and sentry teams, and detailed maps were drawn and shown to foreign reporters as if it were true. When the reporter asked whether the Japanese army would consider it a threat and advance towards Jinzhou since there are so many Chinese troops and scattered soldiers and bandits near the South Manchurian Railway, the Japanese avoided answering. It is speculated that they are preparing for further military action soon. According to the unofficial announcement by the Japanese Army Headquarters this afternoon, the total number of casualties to date is 1,306, including 200 killed, 500 seriously wounded, 400 seriously frostbitten, and 200 slightly frostbitten.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the leader of the Shenyang Chinese Municipal Government is now Zhao Xinbo, who was originally an opera singer from Peiping. Later, he changed careers and went to Japan to study law and political science. Now that he has been appointed as the mayor under the control of the Japanese, he is opening large-scale opium dens and gambling houses and engaging in extensive exploitation. Currently, he has issued licenses for 60 opium dens and gambling houses. Most of these gambling dens are places where people from the lower classes gather to gamble. The license fee ranges from 15 to 25 yuan per day. The reporter investigated a gambling den and took several photos. Outside the doors of each gambling den, there are often crossed Japanese flags, and inside, paper-made Kuomintang flags are often hung. The doors are marked with the words "China-Japan Commercial Club." Inside the main hall, all kinds of Chinese gambling games, from pai gow to fan-tan, are available. Small rooms on the side are equipped with opium pipes and lamps for people to smoke opium, and the price of opium and the name of the opium are clearly marked. They are openly open without any fear. Although there are still places in the three northeastern provinces that grow opium, opium dens and gambling were not openly allowed in Shenyang during Zhang Xueliang's time.</p>
<p>North China Daily News, Harbin, 4th - It is reported that the Chinese police here today seized 144 bombs hidden in wooden boxes transported by train from the south.

Almost every day in the past month, these wooden boxes were transported, but they were only discovered today. Southern mail has not arrived in Harbin for five days. The atmosphere is tense, and people are uneasy. When the reporter was sending the telegram, a Japanese plane was circling in the sky, flying very low.</p>

<p>Photographs of Japanese Troops' Atrocities</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence - News of the loss of Heilongjiang is cut off. A certain gentleman escaped from the tiger's mouth and provides a weekly account as follows: On the afternoon of the 18th, at 6:00 PM, our Heilongjiang army decided to withdraw because they had no reinforcements and lacked ammunition to continue resisting the 10,000+ Japanese troops. The Japanese troops were pressing closely behind. To avoid further conflict, our army withdrew overnight to a place 100+ li north of the provincial capital. At the time of the retreat, the discipline was strict, and the residents of Jiangyuan, except for a small number who had left with Chairman Ma Zhanshan, were mostly unaware. On the morning of the 19th, at 6:00 AM, a Japanese plane circled above Jiangyuan, only six or seven zhang from the ground, making a buzzing sound that shook people's eardrums, startling the city's residents. Soon after, a shedless car with more than ten armed policemen sitting back-to-back drove around the streets. The public security substations on each street also did not see a single policeman. Then, the plane seemed to land in the direction of the Japanese consulate and then took off again. At that time, rumors were rife that the Japanese army had entered the city or had advanced to the Longjiang East Railway Station on Taoang Road. As a result, residents, men and women, young and old, scrambled to escape. Businesses that had already opened their doors closed again. The plane went south and north, surveying the city for a long time, as if to detect the location of our army and worried about ambushes. At the same time, the merchants who were fleeing were also coming in a continuous stream. At 7:00 AM, a white flag with the words "Welcome" written on it was found on the street. No one knows who wrote it. At about 10:00 AM, the Japanese army entered the city from the Longjiang Railway Station on Taoang Road, about 800+ people, and sat outside the walls of the South Manchurian Railway Office. The officials entered the office. Then, several cars went to the South Manchurian Railway Office. Passersby whispered to each other, telling each other that these were traitors going to meet them. After the Japanese army entered the city, they ordered the Provincial Chamber of Commerce to prepare dinner and other supplies for the Japanese army. As of now (when the certain gentleman left), the Provincial Chamber of Commerce has spent tens of thousands of yuan. Usually, major stores and those with more assets are unwilling to contribute a dime to public welfare, but now, they all follow orders carefully. Most households are still closed and dare not go out. That day (the 19th), the Japanese army ordered a curfew, so the night was as silent as death, and the sound of cars and carriages was no longer heard. On the morning of the 20th, a Japanese plane came again. The Japanese army's telephone line was also installed from the East Railway Station north to the South Manchurian Railway Office. Japanese soldiers came and went on the streets a lot. More people fled than yesterday. It became clear that the Japanese army that entered the city yesterday was stationed in the South Barracks. Before noon at 8:00 AM, carriages and horses were like weaving in front of the Chamber of Commerce. The shops on the main street were forced to open and operate as usual, but mostly half-covered. At 11:00 AM, the Japanese army's military telephone line was pulled to the Public Security Bureau inside the Brick City Gate. At the same time, the Japanese army had occupied various agencies in the city. Japanese soldiers with guns were walking on the streets, seemingly boasting of their victory. At 2:00 PM, about twenty Japanese soldiers with hemp ropes went to the Heilongjiang Hotel to inspect. Then, they went to the homes of major households to search. Many people suspected of being soldiers or students were arrested. That day, about six or seven hundred Japanese infantry, cavalry, and artillery units entered the city. When the military flag reached Yong'an Lane, Furong Street (west of the power plant), the sound of artillery fire was suddenly heard from the South Barracks. The reason was unknown. The Japanese army was stationed in the West Barracks (the site of the military sergeant training team). At 6:00 PM that evening, four armored vehicles left from the Longjiang East Railway Station on Taoang Road to Tai'an Town. On the 21st, the Japanese army had completely occupied various agencies. Two or three Japanese soldiers in two small cars sped through the city to demonstrate in various streets and alleys. The Chamber of Commerce issued a notice to reassure the people, and public security was temporarily maintained by Chief Inspector Liu (nicknamed Liu Xiaohu). Since many policemen voluntarily followed Chairman Ma, the fire brigade and traitors pulled from the city were temporarily ordered to set up posts. On the 22nd, the Japanese army issued a notice to reassure the people. At 12:00 PM, three or five Japanese soldiers in full uniform rode horse carriages on the street, seemingly preparing to depart. In the evening, it was heard that the Japanese army had again gone out to pursue our army and that there were fierce battles in Tai'an Town. It was also heard that the Chamber of Commerce was making 300 sets of police uniforms and hiring 300 police to maintain the security of the provincial capital. The Farmers' Association did not participate because no leader attended, so they did not participate in the so-called maintenance of security meeting. In addition to maintaining security, some of the aforementioned 300 police were dispatched to protect the Chamber of Commerce, power plant, telephone bureau, official bank, etc.</p>

<p>It was also heard that the Japanese authorities requested thousands of people from the Chamber of Commerce, and the purpose is unknown. On the 23rd, it was heard that there were only 500 Japanese soldiers stationed in the city. At this time, the Korean residents who usually lived in the provincial capital actually put on Japanese military uniforms and roamed the city with guns, aping others as if they had forgotten that they were slaves of a fallen country. The South Manchurian Railway Office that day instructed the Heilongjiang People's Daily to quickly print 2,000 copies of a map of the area near Jiangyuan for Japanese use. It was also heard that the Japanese army had occupied the school buildings of the West City Transportation Middle School and Normal School as bases for the air force. It was also heard that a team of Japanese troops was attacked by the Xingyang Town militia (i.e., self-defense army) while passing through Ningnian Station on their way from the city, and many were killed. On the 24th, a regiment of Japanese troops stationed in Taonan was transferred to Jiang province. After occupying the various agencies, all accounting, clerical, and staff members could not enter or exit at will, as if there were three-way joint trials. Currently, most of the residents of Jiangyuan have fled, and the population has decreased by about one-third. (Next is January 25)</p>

<p>Second Middle School Suggests that all Middle Schools Continue to Go to Peiping</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence - More than 150 people from the National Wuhan University petition delegation, divided into four teams and sixteen groups, took the China Merchants Bureau's Jiangjing Wheel to Peiping on the evening of the 4th. The highest command of the organization was the Executive Committee, with one chief commander and one deputy commander. Each team had a team leader, and each group had a group leader. On the afternoon of that day, the entire petition delegation, led by Executive Director Wang Chuanzeng, Commander Yin Dekun, Deputy Commander Yan Guangzhi, Team Leader Chen Guangzhu, and Group Leader Cai Renxi, took an oath and set off. President Wang Shijie personally wrote a hand-written note stipulating eight points to be observed in terms of discipline and thirteen measures for punishing violations of discipline, which were mimeographed and distributed to all members to be strictly observed. It is heard that the main points of the petition are divided into six items: (1) Deny the establishment of the Jinzhou Neutral Zone; (2) Request the government to withdraw from the League of Nations; (3) Sever diplomatic relations with Japan and implement the recovery of lost territory by force; (4) Complete peaceful unification; (5) Allow General Zhang Fakui to send troops north immediately; (6) Provide practical assistance to General Ma Zhanshan and issue a declaration urging the government to abandon its policy of non-resistance and no longer rely on the League of Nations, but to fight the Japanese imperialists with blood and heads. They vowed not to return to school if they did not receive a satisfactory response. The students who remained at school decided to set aside the week from the 4th to the 10th as National Crisis Week, suspend classes, intensify military training, and hold lectures on the Sino-Japanese incident to study the anti-Japanese policy. Other schools have not yet organized petition delegations to Peiping. However, the Provincial Second Middle School decided on the 4th to suggest to the Wuhan Academic Anti-Japanese General Association that they organize petition delegations from various middle schools to Peiping to request a declaration of war against Japan (December 4).</p>
<h3 id="e73">Ironclad Proof that the Japanese Military and Civilians Unanimously Plot Against Us <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>The Wokou's Plot to Seize Our Northeast is Entirely Unanimous Between Military and Civilians</p>
<p>It is often said that years of aggressive behavior are all the actions of the tyrannical military factions of their country, and that their people are not like this. Alas, this is a fallacious theory that misleads the country! Now, we have found a copy of the recent resolutions of the "Japanese Residents in Manchuria Emergency Support Association," the content of which is outrageous and infuriating. Isn't this the general mentality of their people? Can it still be said that their people are not the echo of the Tanaka policy? We have translated the various items in the document to alert the people of the country and to prove that there is no meaning in the unanimity of the violent Japanese military and civilians. Now that the Japanese are holding their so-called "All China Residents' General Assembly" in Shanghai, what they resolve should exceed what is contained in this document. When the people of the country read this, they should be able to see Sima Zhao's intentions! The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Resolutions of the Japanese Residents in Manchuria Emergency Support Association</p>
<p>I. Regarding Political, Military, and Diplomatic Matters</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the Sino-Japanese incident, absolutely reject the intervention of the League of Nations and third countries. When necessary, we will not hesitate to withdraw from the League of Nations.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the four northeastern provinces, the Zhang Xueliang faction is a revival of the old regime and will absolutely not be recognized.</p>
<p>(3) We expect the rapid realization of an independent state in the four northeastern provinces.</p>
<p>(4) When resolving the situation, all matters concerning the four northeastern provinces should be negotiated with the aforementioned independent state.</p>
<p>(5) To protect Japanese rights and interests in the four northeastern provinces and the lives and property of the two million Japanese residents, we hope that imperial troops will be dispatched to necessary locations.</p>
<p>(6) The Chinese challenges of anti-Japanese humiliation and anti-Japanese goods should be thoroughly abolished and punished.</p>
<p>(7) When the central regime of the four northeastern provinces establishes a fixed independent country, it should guide and supervise its political administration to ensure the practical resolution of our required pending cases.</p>
<p>II. Regarding Transportation and Communication Matters</p>
<p>(1) The Chinese state-owned railways and ports in the four northeastern provinces should be managed by Japan at least until the situation is resolved.</p>
<p>(2) Various railways belonging to our vested rights should be laid immediately.</p>
<p>(3) Railways that violate transportation treaties and infringe on our rights and interests should be removed.</p>
<p>III. Regarding Financial, Fiscal, and Tariff Matters</p>
<p>(1) The collection of tariffs and taxes outside of treaties in the four northeastern provinces should be absolutely abolished.</p>
<p>(2) Financial institutions in the four northeastern provinces should be quickly established to promote currency integration.</p>
<p>IV. Regarding Commercial, Industrial, Agricultural, Forestry, and Mining Matters</p>
<p>(1) The vested rights of Japanese nationals in the forests, mines, agriculture, and commerce and industry of the four northeastern provinces, whether they are joint ventures or not, should be immediately restored and realized.</p>
<p>(2) The obstacles to Sino-Japanese two-way and general commercial relations in the four northeastern provinces caused by the situation should be quickly rectified to promote their smooth development.</p>
<p>(3) Civil and criminal lawsuits and disputes between Chinese and Japanese parties in the four northeastern provinces should be handled by imperial officials until the situation is resolved.</p>

<p>After Paying Respects to the Late Gu Yingfen, He Attended One Meeting</p>
<p>He and Mr. Wu Chaoshu Departed for Hong Kong Again That Afternoon</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: After the breakdown of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Guangdong Provincial Party Congress, Mr. Hu Zhantang, who had been residing in Shanghai after the departure of Sun Ke and the Wang Jingwei faction's representatives to Hong Kong, went south with Wu Chaoshu and others, intending to mediate. When Hu and his party arrived in Hong Kong, Sun Ke, Chen Youren, Li Wenfan, and others had also arrived in Hong Kong from Macau and held secret talks with Mr. Hu. Hu originally intended to mediate between the two sides in Hong Kong, but because six or seven representatives from Guangdong personally went to Hong Kong to welcome Mr. Hu to the province, Hu believed that it was his close friend Gu Xiangqin's burial on the 29th, which the National Government adorned with state funeral rites, and that it was proper for him to personally attend the funeral, to fulfill the friendship of life and death. Therefore, Hu took the Jinshan steamer from Hong Kong on the evening of the 28th and arrived in the province at 6:30 AM on the 29th. The provincial authorities, having heard the news beforehand, dispatched a large number of military police to guard the wharf and the roads. Chen Jitang, Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, Lin Yunhai, heads of various institutions, representatives of the Fourth Plenary Session, and others, about several hundred in number, waited in front of the wharf. Automobiles with flags high above, reading "Welcome Mr. Hu Hanmin back to Guangdong to preside over major plans," caused heavy traffic and great excitement. After the ship docked, Hu, accompanied by his daughter, Mulan, and Wu Chaoshu, disembarked. Those who followed included Secretary Wang Yangchong and Li Xiangen. Mr. Hu had been away from Guangdong for more than ten years, and this time, returning to his hometown, many old friends welcomed him. On that day, Mr. Hu wore a long cotton gown and a black mandarin jacket, appearing more gaunt than before, but still with a dashing manner. When he walked out of the wharf, due to the crowd, only Chen Jitang and a few others were able to shake hands with Hu; the rest were unable to get close. Chen Jitang then helped Mr. Hu into a car and drove straight to Gu Yingfen's ancestral hall on Cangbian Street to pay respects. Hu was very saddened when he paid respects to Gu, crying bitterly and fainting twice. Fortunately, his daughter Mulan and Gu's relative, Wu Zhimei, were by his side to support him for a long time before leading him upstairs to rest. Hu originally arranged to talk with the welcomers at the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall at noon, but because he was extremely sad at this time and his spirit was weary, he broke his appointment. The welcomers and representatives of various groups waited until the afternoon before dispersing. The authorities, considering that Hu was not feeling well and had chosen Yulu in Ershatou, Dongshan, as Hu's residence, Hu went to Yulu at 1:00 PM. Soon after, leaders of the party, military, and government arrived one after another. In addition to Hu and Wu Chaoshu, those who attended included Chen Jitang, Li Zongren, Huang Xuchu, Xiang Hanping, Deng Zheru, Xiao Focheng, Ma Chaojun, Lin Yun, Chen Ce, Li Yangjing, Feng Zhuwan, Chen Rong, Lin Yizhong, Yu Hanmou, Zhang Huichang, and others. A meeting was held to discuss the current situation, and various issues regarding the resolution of the situation were discussed. The details of the meeting were kept secret. According to outside reports, the resolutions of the Shanghai peace conference still need to be revised. The meeting lasted until about 3:00 PM. After the meeting, those around Hu, seeing that Hu was tired from the day's engagements and that his blood pressure had gradually increased due to excessive crying for Gu, advised Hu to go to Hong Kong for medical treatment. Therefore, Hu hurriedly took the Jinshan night boat to Hong Kong at 4:00 PM on the 29th, arriving in Hong Kong at 11:50 PM that evening. It is said that Hu may return to Guangdong to discuss major plans after resting in Hong Kong for a day or two. Another view is that whether Hu will visit Guangdong again is still questionable.

<p>Shantou Correspondence: The Tai Koo 洋行's Hanyang steamer, which sailed from Xiamen on the 18th and arrived in Shantou, was robbed by pirates riding electric boats off Nan'ao Island. Passengers on the ship lost more than ten thousand yuan in goods and property. When the ship was being robbed, it immediately sent a wireless message to Hong Kong for help. Hong Kong then dispatched a British warship to assist, but by the time it arrived at the scene, the pirates had already fled far away. After receiving the news, Zhang Ruigui, the division commander stationed in Shantou, also sent Chief of Staff Chen Gongxia to lead a company of special agents along with the British warship to Zhelin (in Raoping County) opposite Nan'ao Island. Guan Renfu, the captain of the Chao-Shan coastal security force, also led his troops on the Zhen Dong patrol boat to Zhelin to join in the suppression in the hope of apprehending the bandits and recovering the stolen goods. It is said that about five hundred pirates have gathered in Nan'ao, equipped with small electric boats, guns, and other equipment, specializing in robbing merchant ships traveling north and south, which is also a scourge to navigation.</p>

<p>The Apprehension of Kidnappers: After the execution of the Huzhou bandit Tai Bao Ashu, petty bandit gangs have sprung up, specializing in kidnapping. Recently, kidnapping cases have occurred in Qingpu County and Xiaokunshan Township in this county, causing trouble. Recently, Yang Shijie, a detective of the County Public Security Bureau, learned that Ding Asi, the leader of the kidnappers from Xiaozheng, was hiding in Songjiang, plotting wrongdoing. Therefore, at 7:00 PM on the 3rd, he led his detectives to search a grass shed at the end of Xita Lane, but found nothing. He then captured Ding Asi in a certain teahouse after identifying him. After being informed of the location of the weapons, and with the approval of Director Shen, he immediately dispatched Inspector Ling to assist and rushed to Beijie Jingdi in Xiaokunshan Township. Three Mauser pistols, two rifles, and more than one hundred rounds of ammunition were recovered from a floating coffin. The bandit was brought back at dawn today and is currently being held in the Public Security Bureau for interrogation and handling. It is reported that the bandit is a wanted criminal from Qingpu who has committed many crimes.</p>
<p>The List of Township Heads in the First District is Announced: In August, this county selected two township heads and supervisory committee members from each township in the first district and submitted them to the county government for appointment.

<p>Nanhui Representatives Come to the Provincial Capital to Petition on the Boundary Issue: Twenty-two representatives from Nanhui, including Chen Moquan, came to the provincial capital yesterday to petition on the issue of the demarcation of the boundary between Nanhui and Fengxian. It is reported that this issue arose because Fengxian wanted to划take the old Taiping Township and part of the old Duxing Township of Nanhui under its jurisdiction. Nanhui had convened a boundary committee meeting of local agencies and groups by the county government. The result of the discussion was that Fengxian's claim was groundless. Because the change in the administrative region of the county is compiled and prepared in accordance with the "Outline of the Administrative District or Organization of the County" promulgated by the Ministry of Internal Affairs, even if there are circumstances stipulated in Article 7 of the "Provincial, Municipal, and County Surveying Boundaries," the change in organization must be based on significant administrative inconveniences. The jurisdiction of the old Taiping Township and other areas under Nanhui does not have this kind of shortcoming for Fengxian. Therefore, various agencies and groups such as the County Chamber of Commerce and the Fund Property Office held a boundary protection movement conference in Biyutang on the 29th. Hundreds of representatives from all walks of life and residents of Taiping Township unanimously opposed being劃taken into Fengxian's jurisdiction, and elected the Fund Property Office Chen Moquan, County Chamber of Commerce Pan Ziping, County Education Association Zhao Xinmei, County Party Department Zhu Jiming, Education Bureau Shi Shunyuan, Relief Institute Shen Kejun and other districts Zhang Yiyi, and civilian representatives such as Wang Yinchong to come to the provincial capital to petition. They first went to the Department of Civil Affairs on the morning of the 3rd, followed by the Provincial Government. The result was very satisfactory.</p>

<p>The County Public Security Bureau's Prohibition of Temple Fair ถูกทำลาย by the Crowd: Yesterday evening (the 4th) around 7:00 PM, the Jingjiang Wang Temple Fair of Daoyuanwan passed by the Nanqiao County Public Security Bureau. In order to maintain order, the bureau sent Patrolman Wang to lead the police to stop it. Unexpectedly, the temple fair crowd, relying on their numbers, insisted on entering the street, which led to a conflict. On the spot, five or six hundred people gathered and rushed to the bureau, destroying the door plank and other facilities. The situation became tense and almost led to a major disaster. Fortunately, County Magistrate Shen Qingkang personally came out to pacify the situation, along with Weng Zuguang, a member of the County Executive Committee, and local gentry Lin Shiming and Li Tianmin. They tried their best to persuade the crowd, which finally defused the situation. The cause of the incident was reportedly due to the police being beaten and firing shots into the air.</p>

<p>筹组筹组of a Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce: In the spring of this year, the chambers of commerce of various counties in Jiangsu Province gathered in the provincial capital to discuss the business tax issue. In order to achieve the overall unity of merchants throughout the province, in accordance with Article 37 of the Chamber of Commerce Law, the chambers of commerce of Zhenjiang, Jiangdu, Suzhou, Wuxi, Nantong, and other counties initiated the formation of a provincial federation of chambers of commerce, and submitted a request to the Jiangsu Provincial Party Department for a permit. However, after half a year, the permit has been delayed and has almost become a dead letter. Recently, representatives from various county chambers of commerce gathered in the province and agreed that the formation of a provincial federation of chambers of commerce by merchants in accordance with the law is a legitimate right. The translated text only requires the initiation of more than one-fifth to be legal, and there is no reason to obstruct it. At this time when the situation is urgent and there are many business accidents, all merchants in the province should urgently seek unity and work together to relieve the national crisis and solve business difficulties. It was decided to appoint the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce as the representative to urge the Party and government organs to complete the task in the shortest possible time. Before the provincial federation of chambers of commerce is completed, the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce is publicly recommended to preside over all matters in the province. To date, the chambers of commerce that have not attended have sent letters from the Wuxi Chamber of Commerce to various counties, unanimously advocating.</p>

It was said that it had bribed to be released by 30,000 yuan. The Anti-Japanese Association has launched a strict investigation into the case and offered a reward of 10,000 yuan for reporting it. Lixin Company has also sent a letter to the Chamber of Commerce requesting that it forward the letter to the County Party Department and the County Government, asking the Anti-Japanese Association Prosecutor's Office to name the person who said this and to demand that they provide factual evidence or take responsibility for false accusations.

The Chamber of Commerce has sent a letter to the County Party Department and the County Government for reference. If the person who made the accusation cannot be held responsible, it is clear that they are arbitrarily spreading rumors to undermine the national goods movement and national salvation work. It is requested that severe sanctions be imposed to deter those who take the opportunity to cause trouble.</p>

We hope you will telegram Nanchang to inquire and show us for it’s honor, respectfully, Hanmin, Ke, Chaoshu Wenfan, Youren. The current negotiation situation is such that various Chinese and Western newspapers have reported various stories, such as the Jinzhou neutral zone and the joint management of Tianjin. The truth is unclear. The Guangzhou comrades have sent this telegram, and their desire to be informed of the details is extremely urgent. The Shanghai conference had a resolution on the diplomatic policy, which was a mutually agreed decision. We respectfully request that you provide detailed information so that we can pass it on. Respectfully, Wang Zhaoming, Zou Lu.</p>

<p>Explaining the Government's Policy Toward Japan</p>
<p>Central Committee member Shao Lizizhou arrived in Shanghai by early express train from Beijing yesterday morning, accompanied by 晚點遲. The reporter of the Hua Dong News Agency met with the two gentlemen at the station to discuss various matters. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Shao said that according to Shao, the rumors about opposing the establishment of a neutral zone have been rampant in recent days, but they are actually misunderstandings. When the situation in Jinzhou was urgent some time ago, our country telegraphed Minister Shi Zhaoji asking the League of Nations to take appropriate measures to stop the Japanese from advancing into Jinzhou. Therefore, the League of Nations had a plan to establish a neutral zone. However, the government will certainly not accept this kind of neutral zone. I came to Shanghai specifically to explain this matter to the various circles in Shanghai to avoid further misunderstandings among the people.</p>
<p>He said that according to He, the Fourth First Executive Committee is now waiting for the Guangdong situation to subside. The government has not accepted the rumors about the neutral zone. There are also rumors that Tianjin is jointly managed, which is even more unfounded. I came here to discuss with the Guangdong representatives staying in Shanghai. The date for Chairman Chiang to go north has not yet been determined.</p>
<p>Meeting Tonight: Last night, after He and Shao arrived in Shanghai, they went to the Public Restroom of the Municipal Government to hold a meeting. Those present included Mayor Zhang and leaders from various circles. It is reported that they reported on the central government's determined policy towards Japan.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Representatives of Various Schools in the Capital Welcomed Representative Wang. They Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Evening <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Scheduled to Visit Wang Today</p>
<p>Hua Dong News Agency said that over one hundred and eighty representatives from various schools in Nanjing who came to Shanghai to welcome Wang Jingwei's entry into Beijing to preside over the affairs of the Party and the country arrived in Shanghai at 6:00 PM this afternoon. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Number of Arrivals: Yesterday, a total of 189 representatives from 14 schools in Nanjing arrived in Shanghai, including Anhui Sanmin, Zhongnan Wenhua, Yuqun, Wusa Middle Schools, Nanjing Girls' Middle School, and the Poor Children's Home. The general commander was Wang Jianyu of the Poor Children's Home, and the chief inspector was Jing Jinxiang.</p>
<p>Welcoming Personnel: Those who arrived at the station last night to welcome included Liu Chuancheng, Liu Xiuru, Cui Buyu, Yuan Song, Liu Guoze, Li Shiyuan, Chen Xinghua, representatives of the Foreign Association of the Republic of China, and representatives of the Anti-Japanese Association of Shanghai Universities, Hu Guangyi, Wang Duannian, Ma Jibo, Lin Zuyin, Lin Weidong, representatives of the Guangzhou Student Federation, and Ma Huayi, Bao Tianfang, representatives of the United Office of Student Representatives from Various Provinces and Cities, Yan Wenzhang of Jinan University's Anti-Japanese Association, Yu Pu, and dozens of others.</p>
<p>Arrival at the Station: The director of Public Security局陈局长, specially派巡官苏鑫, and more than a dozen 长警于昨晨即派巡官苏鑫, as soon as the news came out last night that the student representatives would arrive in Shanghai by night train. The Zhulu Police Section was also added to by朱警务长加派路警维持秩序. The train arrived at the North Station at 6:00 PM yesterday. All the welcoming staff were holding welcome banners and were waiting on the platform. When the representatives got off the train, they shouted slogans and held up the words "Welcome Mr. Wang to return to Beijing to preside over the affairs of the Party and the country." Then they gathered on the platform. The representatives of Shanghai universities escorted the representatives to the Jiangwan Law School to rest. The Aftermath of the Train: Before the representatives left Beijing the night before, the Nanjing station received a transfer from the Ministry of Railways ordering that the representatives not be allowed to take the train. The representatives' negotiations were unsuccessful, so the chief of the Beijing station, Gao, was beaten, and the entire stationmaster's office was also destroyed. At 12 o'clock, the stationmaster was dragged out and searched for a locomotive (at that time, the night train's locomotive had been removed). They also obtained a driver who was old and did not drive, and forced him to drive. Because the route ticket was not signed, it was quite dangerous. At 3 o'clock, they arrived at Yaohuamen. The representatives learned that Guan, the Department Chief of the Railway Department, was in the sleeper car, so they wanted to force Guan to order the train to start. Fortunately, Xie inspector of the 两路 Police cleverly excused that Guan was not in the car and locked all the sleeper car doors to prevent accidents. At 6:00 AM yesterday, they arrived at Zhenjiang. The station telegraphed Beijing and the Shanghai Transportation Office for instructions. They then received a reply from Beijing instructing them to allow it. The stationmaster informed the representatives of this, and the right to drive the train was taken back by the Railway Bureau. Then the train could drive as usual. Therefore, the dispute over the train was resolved and they were able to drive directly to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Welcoming Wang to Beijing: According to the representatives who came to Shanghai to the Huadong News Agency, this trip to Shanghai was to represent the various schools in Nanjing to welcome Mr. Wang Jingwei to Beijing to preside over the affairs of the Party and the country so that Chairman Chiang could go north. They will petition at Wang's residence on Pushe Road tomorrow (today) morning, and will return to Beijing to report to the various schools after achieving their goal.</p>
<p>Slogans for Welcoming Wang: (1) Welcome Mr. Wang who protects the Party and saves the country. (2) Welcome Mr. Wang who leads the youth of the country. (3) Welcome Mr. Wang who relieves the suffering of the people. (4) Welcome Mr. Wang who puts an end to internal warfare and refreshes domestic affairs. (5) Welcome Mr. Wang who advocates the realization of democratic politics. (6) Welcome Mr. Wang and Mr. Chiang and Hu to jointly manage the affairs of the country. (7) Welcome Mr. Wang and Mr. Chiang and Hu to jointly drive the Japanese soldiers out of the country. (8) Welcome Mr. Wang and Mr. Chiang and Hu to seek lasting peace in the country. (9) Welcome Mr. Wang to Beijing to implement revolutionary diplomacy. (10) Welcome Mr. Wang who advocates the immediate recovery of the lost territory in the Northeast. (11) Welcome Mr. Wang who opposes the non-resistance policy. (12) Welcome Mr. Wang who advocates that the military should not interfere in politics.</p>
<p>Meeting Today: Because there are too many students and Wang Jingwei's private residence is too small to accommodate everyone at the same time, it has been decided that ten people will be in a group and will be interviewed in batches.</p>
<p>Foreign Envoys Traveling Together: In addition to Guan, the Secretary of the Ministry of Railways, and the diplomatic officials of Germany and the United States and their retinue were also traveling on the same train.</p>
<p>All Trains Delayed: All the trains from Beijing to Shanghai yesterday were delayed due to the delay of the night train along the way. The first train from Beijing to Shanghai should have arrived in Shanghai at 4:15 PM yesterday according to the regular schedule, but it was delayed until 9:30 PM. The Minister of Military and Political Affairs, He Yingqin, and member of the Central Committee, Shao Lizizhou, were also on the train. The other express trains, the Beijing-Hangzhou through train, and the 2nd and 4th class slow trains are expected to arrive this morning.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Yesterday's Emergency Meeting of All Circles in This City <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Resolved to Implement People's Self-Defense to Save the Country; Group Representatives to Continue Meeting Today</p>
<p>Youth Association Members, Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, National Progress Association, Postal Workers' Union, Diligent National Products Association, Shanghai Secondary School Youth Association, Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, and other groups convened an emergency meeting yesterday at 3 PM at the Youth Association on Sichuan Road to oppose accepting the humiliating conditions of ceding sovereignty in the Northeast. More than sixty groups participated, with approximately a thousand people in attendance. A resolution was passed to implement the People's Self-Defense to Save the Country. The atmosphere at the meeting was impassioned. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Attending Groups: More than sixty groups attended, including the Ten-Person Anti-Japanese National Salvation Group, Taiwan Remnants Association, Money Industry Anti-Japanese Association, Chinese Women's Political Participation Association, China Colonial Border Association, People's Diplomacy Support Association, Japan Research Association, Foreign Firm Chinese Employees Anti-Japanese Association, Party Protection Comrades Association, Pharmaceutical Industry Union, Shanghai Women's Middle School, Southeast Five Provinces Anti-Japanese Association, First District Shipbuilding Association, Cloth Industry Anti-Japanese Workers Union, Zhengfeng College, Ministry of Transportation Telecommunications School, Third District Dyeing Industry Anti-Japanese Association, Mahjong Industry Anti-Japanese Association, Western District Yarn Industry Union, Ai Qun Girls' School, Flying Flower Union, Ham Industry Guild, etc.</p>
<p>Meeting Proceedings: At the beginning of the meeting, Yin Zhiling, Wu Mai, Zhang Shaojie, Wu Ziqian, and Tan Zhibo were publicly elected as the presidium. Miao Zhijie and Liu Xiaozhou served as recorders. After the presidium took their seats, the entire assembly stood in silent tribute for three minutes to mourn the compatriots who died in the Northeast. Then, Yin Zhiling, the chairman, reported on the purpose of the meeting, stating that since the "September 18th Incident," when the Northeast was forcibly occupied by Japan, the Chinese government has relied on the League of Nations, hoping it would resolve the issue. However, after various meetings of the League of Nations, there were no results, and instead, five major conditions were proposed, including establishing Jinzhou as a neutral zone under international management, which the Chinese government has implicitly acquiesced to. If the Chinese government accepts these conditions, it would be tantamount to surrendering the entire Great China to other countries and inviting its own demise. Furthermore, yesterday's newspapers reported that the Dutch Minister Shih K'o-kung suddenly proposed at the League of Nations meeting to place Tianjin under international co-governance. However, today's newspapers reported that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the capital did not mention this case when hosting the press yesterday at noon. Therefore, the origin of this proposal deserves attention. The purpose of today's meeting is to discuss remedial measures regarding this type of incident. Subsequently, Wu Mai reported, stating that in this critical time of national peril, we should fight the invaders with our blood. Then, Tan Zhibo, Zhang Shaojie, and others delivered speeches that were very impassioned.</p>
<p>Passing Resolutions: After the speeches, more than fifty draft resolutions were discussed. The preparatory committee then presented a general proposal after revisions by the assembly, namely, "Implement People's Self-Defense to Save the Country." A resolution was passed, and each group present elected one official representative to be responsible for organizing a joint national salvation association to discuss and implement the measures. Afterwards, a photograph was taken, and the meeting adjourned. The meeting of the group representatives is scheduled to be held at the Youth Association again at 7 PM tomorrow to discuss and decide on the implementation of the resolutions.</p>

<p>Returned to Guilin to Reorganize the Army Awaiting Orders</p>
<p>It is learned that after the Fourth Army Commander of the National Revolutionary Army, Zhang Fakui, requested to assist the Northeast against Japanese barbarity, the two commanders-in-chief of Guangzhou, Chen Jitang and Li Jishen, telegraphed urging Mr. Zhang to return to Guangzhou quickly for joint consultation. It is now learned that Mr. Zhang, after telegraphing again requesting to assist the Northeast, took only three or four attendants and boarded the French mail steamer Perreire Cruessel yesterday at noon, heading to Hong Kong and then to Guangdong and Guilin. Upon arriving in Guilin, he will lead all the soldiers of the Fourth Army to the north to assist the Northeast.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Overseas Chinese Increase Contributions to Purchase Aircraft to Resist Japan <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Increased Contribution of Eight Thousand Yuan to Purchase Training Aircraft</p>
<p>Overseas Compatriots All Rose Up Upon Hearing the News</p>
<p>Anti-Japanese National Salvation Corps of the Chinese National Anti-Drug Association: The entire body of compatriots and members of the Penang Reading Newspaper Society in British Malaya, in view of the rampant Japanese invaders who forcibly occupied the three northeastern provinces, was filled with righteous indignation. They previously dispatched Mr. Xu Shengli, a local overseas Chinese leader, to return to China to petition the National Government for the purchase of an aircraft to prepare for war against the Japanese army, and have already remitted ten thousand yuan to Mr. Xu to forward to the National Government. It is learned that this training aircraft requires a price of eighteen thousand yuan. The previously remitted ten thousand yuan was still insufficient. Mr. Xu then telegraphed to Penang to explain the situation and instructed them to remit another eight thousand yuan in order to complete the aircraft purchase procedures. A reply telegram was received expressing approval, and the funds are being remitted. They should arrive soon. In addition, the comrades of the society in Penang are devising methods to promote the grand idea of practical national salvation to overseas compatriots in various places, hoping for a common response. It is heard that Mr. Hu Wenhu, a prominent overseas Chinese magnate in Singapore, will also follow suit by helping to purchase three aircraft and donating 10,000 cans of Tiger Balm. Recently, the establishment of an aviation school in Fujian Province was also advocated, and overseas Chinese from Fujian in various places have recognized and donated over 2.9 million yuan. This care for the motherland cannot but inspire respect, and the initiative taken by the society should not be forgotten.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Youth Aid-to-Manchuria Corps Departs Today <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's Farewell Banquet by All Circles</p>
<p>Concentration at the North Station This Afternoon</p>
<p>The Youth Volunteer Aid-to-Manchuria Anti-Japanese Corps has been established for several weeks, and internal work has been very intense. It is now learned that the corps has decided to concentrate at the North Station at 2 PM today to depart together and serve the country in the north. Yesterday at noon, the corps held a farewell banquet for all circles at the Gongdelin restaurant on Baker Road. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Farewell Banquet: More than twenty people attended the farewell banquet for the Youth Aid-to-Manchuria Corps yesterday, including Shen Yangyao, Pan Xulun, Huang Jingwan, and Zhang Zhilian. During the banquet, Zhang Shaojie, the corps commander, stood up and delivered a speech, stating that today's banquet is a farewell to everyone. He deeply hopes that we will never meet again in the future, as we have long made the determination to expose our bones in the battlefield. The funds for this corps were generously collected by all circles in Shanghai, for which we are deeply grateful. In the future, we deeply hope that everyone present can provide us with assistance in the rear and that you will work hard to promote the corps' purpose to the masses, so that the masses can advance along the trail of our blood. Finally, I hope that you will give us last-minute instructions here, and we will sincerely accept your guidance. Then, guest Huang gave an impromptu speech that was very impassioned. All attendees were deeply moved. A photograph was then taken, and the banquet was adjourned.</p>
<p>Women Participating: According to the corps commander, Zhang Shaojie, yesterday, the total number of corps members was 554. However, yesterday afternoon, four female students studying at Fudan University and two female students from Zhenjiang requested to join. They bit their fingers on the spot and wrote a request for the corps to accept them. The corps could not refuse, so it agreed to their participation. Recently, many letters have been received from enthusiastic youths in Nanjing, Jinan, Beiping, and other places, all expressing their willingness to join the corps when it passes through their areas and go north together to shed blood for the country. It is estimated that when the corps reaches Beiping, there will be at least a thousand members. I (Zhang, referring to himself) deeply hope that this national salvation movement can gradually expand.</p>
<p>Departure Today: The corps has decided to hold a rally of farewell for the corps members at 9 AM today at the Ximen Public Sports Field. At that time, corps member badges will be distributed, and luggage will be organized. Corps members' families and friends are invited to attend the farewell. At 2 PM, they will concentrate at the North Station to board the train and depart for Beijing, then head north.</p>
<p>Farewell to Shanghai, a Declaration of the Youth Volunteer Aid-to-Manchuria Anti-Japanese Corps: Because negotiations with the railway station regarding free tickets have still yielded no results, the corps plans to request boarding the train again today. When all the corps members arrive at the station, they will hold a rally of farewell for the corps members on the open space next to the station. The corps' declaration of departure from Shanghai is recorded below: Dear compatriots, farewell forever. We shall not meet again. At this moment of farewell, with heartstrings breaking, we respectfully offer our final words here for our compatriots to remember: Ever since Liaoning and Jilin fell and the Hei River was invaded, with Jinzhou in danger and Tianjin in chaos, the so-called justice and righteousness have long been extinguished. Yet our authorities still rely on the League of Nations, listening to its dictates. Recently, there was even a proposal to designate Jinzhou as a neutral zone and demand joint administration of Tianjin. Hearing this, our hearts ache and tears cannot flow. The members of our corps deeply feel the great meaning of national demise being our own demise, and vow to seek survival for the nation and preserve the country's territory with our blood. We will not live unless this goal is achieved. Compatriots, is this the time when life is glorious and death is regrettable? Saving the country with iron and blood is the time! This is the time! Now, the comrades are setting out today, purely to fulfill our natural duty, and proceeding of our own volition. Knowing that the road is long and the weather is cold, we are determined to brave the dangers and advance. If we can reach the Heilongjiang region and join General Ma Zhanshan in annihilating those Japanese invaders, then even if our bones are exposed on the battlefield, we will have no regrets. We hope that our passionate compatriots will follow our example, bravely stepping in our bloody footprints, and advance. Compatriots, we are leaving. Farewell. After our souls wander beyond the border, at our last meeting, we will sing a sorrowful song of Yishui. We respectfully wish our rear compatriots to cherish the country.</p>

<p>How Can There Be Negotiations When Japanese Troops Have Not Withdrawn?</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce telegraphed Foreign Minister Gu Weijun on the Japanese invasion of Northeast China, expressing opposition to direct negotiations with Japan, as signs of direct negotiations become increasingly apparent. It is now learned that Mr. Gu replied to the Chamber yesterday, saying: "To the esteemed Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, I have read your telegram, which shows patriotic enthusiasm. I am deeply moved. I am serving in diplomacy with my meager talents and my long-held aim is to protect national rights. I am aware of this foolish sincerity. Now, I am ordered to serve in a time of national crisis, and I am even more aware of my responsibility for the country's rise and fall. Currently, Japanese troops have not withdrawn, so how can there be negotiations? I will certainly follow the National Government's lead, gather opinions widely, and strive to the best of my ability to the end. I am honored by your guidance. I dare to express my heartfelt sentiments. Gu Jijun, with his official seal."</p>

<h3 id="e97">Commemoration of the Zhaohai Warship Uprising Held Yesterday <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the 16th anniversary of the Zhaohai Warship Uprising. The Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters specially convened representatives from all circles of the city to hold a commemorative meeting. Approximately 300 representatives attended. Chairman Chen Kecheng reported on the facts of the uprising and the significance of the commemoration, and elaborated on the efforts and directions we should take in the future. The details of the meeting are recorded below:</p>
<p>Meeting Order: (1) Entire body stand at attention; (2) Sing the Party song; (3) Pay the highest respect to the Party and National flag and the portrait of the Premier; (4) Chairman respectfully reads the Premier's will; (5) Silence; (6) Chairman's report; (7) Speeches; (8) Slogans; (9) Adjournment.</p>
<p>Attending Representatives: Yang Zheng, Hang Ding'an (Social Affairs Bureau); Xu Jingzhi (Cotton Textile Workers' Union); Yang Youren (Publishing Workers' Union); Yu Hongzhang, Lu Dafu (Civil Shipping Workers' Union); Wang Bingkui (Wine Making Workers' Union); Yu Guoying, Pan Shangsun (Dyeing Workers' Union); Qin Hegao (Quanzhang Middle School); Hu Jinglin (Cigarette Workers' Union); Yao Suikai (Coal and Firewood Workers' Union); and representatives from all levels of Party headquarters, all agencies, and all groups, totaling more than 300 people.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: Sixteen years ago, on December 5th, 1915, the Party's martyr Mr. Chen Yingzhi, acting on the Premier's orders, gathered comrades in Shanghai to orchestrate the great mission of the Zhaohai Warship Uprising, with the aim of capturing Shanghai as the vanguard for the national campaign against Yuan Shikai. At that time, Mr. Chen Yingzhi was in charge, Mr. Chiang Kai-shek was the planner, and Mr. Yang Hu was the executor. Mr. Chiang's plan was to occupy the warship and fort while actively attacking the arsenal. As a result of the revolutionary comrades' efforts, the Zhaohai warship was safely occupied, but the land attack failed due to strict defenses. Although the matter did not succeed, it was as great and heroic as the March 29th Guangzhou Uprising, and it was even more important for intensifying the Yunnan Uprising and overthrowing Yuan Shikai. Yuan Shikai seized the presidency of the Republic of China through the Xinhai Revolution but did not think of being loyal to the Republic, instead acting perversely, not only betraying his oath but also revealing his ambition for an imperial system, even colluding with Japan as foreign aid, allowing Japanese imperialism to take advantage of the European war to occupy Qingdao. Yuan Shikai did not hesitate to betray the country, agreeing to the Twenty-One Demands as an exchange condition for recognizing the imperial system, becoming so insane that the Party's Premier Sun Yat-sen, seeing this crisis, assigned responsibilities to actively carry out the campaign against Yuan. The Zhaohai Uprising was one of its initiatives. Although the grand and heroic Zhaohai Uprising did not succeed, it terrified Yuan Shikai, and anti-Yuan armies rose up everywhere. Yuan Shikai felt increasingly threatened and died in distress and anger. The foundation of the Republic was saved from danger. This is not only the glorious history of the Party but also the key to the revival of the Republic of China. Sixteen years have passed since then. The foundation of the country is even more shaky than before, and the invasion of foreign powers is even worse than before. Looking at the past and thinking about the present, mixed feelings arise. The Zhaohai Uprising was a matter of sixteen years ago. The courage of the comrades at that time to sacrifice themselves for the country was unmatched in the world. It is almost impossible to find such people today. Even cooperating and working together is hesitant and awkward, which is why the national crisis is lighter in the past and heavier today. It is even more unsurprising that solving the national crisis is easier in the past and more difficult today. If we have the same heroic and fearless determination as we did then, what difficulty would there be in resisting Japanese imperialism? What difficulty would there be in suppressing the domestic Red bandits? If we continue to focus on personal prejudices and desires for power, then the national crisis in the future will be unpredictable, and the nation's peril will be unimaginable. This is what our comrades should deeply reflect on, awaken to, and unite to urgently. The Japanese imperialists' ambition to invade our country has been around for a long time. In 1915, they had already revealed their sharp edge. If there were no righteous people of Zhaohai who fought bravely and killed the enemy, China would not know what it would be like today. Up to now, the Party's military strength has spread throughout the country, but the political foundation has not yet been stabilized, causing foreign insults to come and bandits to run rampant. In the future, how should the whole country unite sincerely to plan for internal stability and external resistance in order to save our dying country? Otherwise, we will have no way to face the righteous people of Zhaohai, no way to face the national masses, and even have no way to see the Premier underground in the future. I hope that we will all act together and strive for it.</p>
<p>Meeting Slogans: (1) Commemorate the great Zhaohai Uprising; (2) The Zhaohai Uprising is the key to the revival of the Republic of China; (3) The Zhaohai Uprising is to overthrow Yuan Shikai; (4) The Zhaohai Uprising is to resist the invasion of the Japanese barbarians; (5) Continue the spirit of the Zhaohai Uprising; (6) Compatriots across the country, unite; (7) Achieve peaceful reunification; (8) Forever break off economic relations with Japan; (9) Strive for military training; (10) Recover the lost territories of the Northeast; (11) Down with Japanese imperialism; (13) Long live the Chinese Kuomintang; (14) Long live the Republic of China.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Second Batch of Premier Stamps Arrives in Shanghai <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>To Be Distributed to All Postal Districts Nationwide Within Days</p>
<p>Martyr Stamps to Arrive in Shanghai by Year-End, Issued on New Year's Day</p>
<p>The Premier Commemorative Stamps were previously ordered by the Post Administration Bureau to be issued on November 12th in all postal districts nationwide. However, since a portion of the first batch of stamps arriving in Shanghai still needed to undergo reproduction procedures before they could be issued, and the supply office in Shanghai had limited inventory, only Beijing and Shanghai first issued and used them on the due date. Other provincial postal districts had to wait until the new stamps being shipped were delivered to Shanghai before the supply office could gradually send them to various districts. It is learned that the second batch of two-fen and four-fen Premier stamps sent by the De La Rue printing company in England arrived at sea yesterday, totaling fifty large boxes, with a total number of approximately 100 to 150 million. Because the postal authorities are routinely closed on Saturdays and Sundays, starting tomorrow (Monday), after the supply office distributes a fixed number, it will gradually send them to the 23 domestic postal districts based on the distance of the postal routes. It is reported that each district can be delivered for sale within this year. The third batch of new manual stamps will arrive in Shanghai by the end of the year. The martyr's portrait stamps printed by the Beiping Ministry of Finance Printing Bureau are being rushed. The General Bureau has now decided that if the stamps are delivered within the year, they will be issued on New Year's Day in 1932.</p>

(10) Ningbo Compatriots Association and eight elementary schools request an investigation of Japanese waxed paper: It was resolved that it is not within the scope of national products, so it is not convenient to investigate.

There were also six other proposals, and it was decided to postpone the discussion to the next meeting because the statutory time had been extended by 30 minutes.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Wang Jingwei and Others Yesterday Hosted a Banquet for Guangdong's Withdrawing Representatives <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Wang Gave a Very Long Speech</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei and Guangdong's representatives hosted a banquet for all withdrawing representatives, numbering over 200 people, yesterday at noon at the Dongya Restaurant in the name of the presidium of the Guangdong withdrawing representatives. All seven members of the presidium, Wang Jingwei, Chen Bijun, Gu Mengyu, Wang Faqin, Guo Chuntao, Zhao Pilian, and Bai Yunti, personally received the guests. The hosts and guests conversed freely until 2:30 PM. During the banquet, Mr. Wang Jingwei, on behalf of the entire presidium, gave a very long speech, encouraging the representatives on how to struggle in the future. The speech is recorded below:</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Jingwei's Speech: "Fellow comrades, today we invite you to this gathering. The preparations were extremely simple and not very respectful. However, before we leave Jing, we have the opportunity to meet here, which is a very valuable opportunity. Today, the presidium has entrusted me to say a few words. What I will be talking about today is primarily about our future joint work. As for the election issue and the Central Committee member issue, these are very small matters. The term of office for the Central Committee members is only one or two years. We should focus entirely on our methods of joint work and joint struggle, especially in this time of crisis for the Party and the nation, and particularly with Japan's dispatch of troops to the Northeast and the tense diplomatic situation. I would like to first report to everyone on the process of this election. When the peace conference in Shanghai had just ended, the seven of us, along with the six representatives from Guangdong and Mr. Hu Zhantang, sent a telegram to the Guangdong Extraordinary Conference proposing to adopt the limited joint election method for the upcoming Fourth Plenary Session election of 24 Central Committee members, with each vote electing eight people, because this method of election would allow both the majority and minority to have the opportunity to be elected. The Guangdong side immediately telegraphed back their approval. Therefore, the number of our withdrawing representatives in Shanghai, over 200, is more than one-third of the total of over 500 representatives. Therefore, we elected ten Central Committee members in Shanghai. This meaning was already stated at the previous meeting. A few days ago, we received two telegrams from Guangzhou. One was from Comrade Sun Zhesheng, saying that the Fourth Plenary Session in Guangzhou had overturned the limited election method, and his words expressed infinite indignation. The second telegram was from Comrade Li Zongren, saying that the Fourth Plenary Session decided that the presidium would introduce 14 candidates for Central Committee members, and the representative assembly would introduce 24 candidates for the election, and then the general assembly would hold a re-election. After receiving these two telegrams, we believe that the Fourth Plenary Session in Guangzhou cannot do this, because in fact, we came to Guangzhou entirely for cooperation. The number of representatives leaving Guangzhou this time is also more than one-third, so the election on December 3rd was very fair. Today, according to the reports, the Guangzhou side has elected 24 Central Committee members, and our list has not been accepted by them. This was expected. However, no matter what, I, representing the presidium and my fellow comrades, can responsibly say that we will definitely do our best to maintain the results of the election of representatives in Shanghai. We may use moderate means to fight for it, or even not be Central Committee members, as long as we achieve our goal. The second point is about our future joint work. This is what we should pay the most attention to. What we need most now is our joint action. The action of a revolutionary party member should be governed by reason. If one can govern their actions with reason, then power cannot subdue them, and wealth cannot move them. But how can we have joint action? Because there is a common proposition. To have a common proposition, we must first have a common discussion. But discussion is not an easy thing, so we must first have a common research. But research alone is not enough. It is easy for an individual to govern their thoughts with reason, but it is difficult to govern their actions with reason. For example, social malpractices often have the knowledge that they are contemptible in reason, but their actions are infected by them. So we must first talk about the issue of integrity. We must have integrity and then have a revolutionary personality. Therefore, we must first jointly encourage integrity to cultivate revolutionary figures. Only with a revolutionary personality can we achieve revolutionary achievements. In this way, we must first jointly encourage integrity, then have joint research, have joint research, then have joint discussion, have joint discussion, then have joint proposition, and have joint proposition, then have joint action. This is our common need. So how should we work together? From now on, we should follow this method to seek joint efforts. In the future, if we are scattered, we should have very close communication methods. If we gather together, we should have opportunities for discussion at all times. We are together in common, and we are also in common when we are not together. We jointly encourage integrity, jointly research, jointly discuss, jointly propose, and jointly act. From the individual to the Party to the nation, we are all fighting together in this way. As for the day of death, it also begins here. Therefore, our unity is a union of reason and is by no means for the small matter of Central Committee members. Everything we do is guided by reason to achieve the goal of joint action. Only in this way can we have a revolutionary personality, and only with a revolutionary personality can we shoulder the revolutionary cause. Conversely, if we do not take reason as our guide, do not encourage integrity, then we cannot have joint research, cannot have joint discussion, cannot have joint proposition, and cannot have joint action. So, at today's banquet, I am putting forward this idea for self-encouragement and to encourage all comrades. I wish all comrades good health."</p>

<p>Wang Xiaolai, a standing committee member of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, sent a letter of resignation to the association yesterday, stating: "I have been trying my best since I took over as a standing committee member, and I am deeply apprehensive and fear that I am responsible for the great cause, and I dare not not work hard, but I am involved in the complicated public affairs of the group, and I am ashamed of my failure. Now that the diplomacy is urgent and the work is becoming more and more important, it seems that it is not something that I, like Xiaolai, can do all day long. I hereby resign to give way to the virtuous and capable. As for Xiaolai's position as chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, the salvation of the country and the protection of merchants are equally important. Regarding the quick planning and disposal of detained goods, and the proper handling of sealed goods, I will continue to uphold my long-standing ambition to be responsible and try to assist in solving the problem, so that the Japanese goods can be cleaned up and the boycott can be sustained, the economy will not be panicked, and the New Year can be passed smoothly. Fortunately, in terms of discussing matters, all the committee members are aware of the situation and must have appropriate decisions. In terms of discussing people, the service personnel had a resolution when the Anti-Japanese Association was first established that the guarantor committee should be fully responsible, so there is no need to worry too much. I hereby send this letter to request that you follow the example and grant it. I am very grateful to the Shanghai Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association."</p>

<h3 id="e110">Unscrupulous Nephew Slashes and Kills Uncle, Aunt, and Cousin <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Three Out of Four Family Members Die</p>
<p>Nephew Is Vicious and Repays Kindness with Enmity</p>
<p>Perpetrator Escapes with Over a Hundred Yuan</p>
<p>Wang Zhenyuan Survives on the Third Floor</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, a bloody case occurred at the Wang Yuanxing Lumber Shop at the intersection of Dongxi Huade Road and Gongping Road. The deceased were the shop owner Wang Jiashun, his wife Jiang, and their eldest son, Xingbao. All three had their heads slashed open and fingers chopped off, a gruesome sight. The perpetrator, Wang's nephew Wang Songfa, fled without a trace after committing the crime. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Operating Lumber Shop for Nearly Ten Years: Wang Jiashun, a 54-year-old Ningbo native, has been operating the Wang Yuanxing Lumber Shop at 1673 Dongxi Huade Road for nearly ten years. The business is doing well, with annual profits. Wang usually lives frugally and has some savings. His wife, Jiang, is 44 years old and has a son and a daughter. The eldest son, Xingbao, is 16 years old and studies at Chengzhong School. The younger daughter, Zhenyuan, is 16 years old and sews at home. The shop employs three old clerks and three apprentices.</p>
<p>A Nephew Who Is Extremely Unscrupulous: Wang has a nephew named Songfa, 24 years old. His father, Jinmu, works at the Li Yun Yarn Factory in Jiangyin. Songfa has been unscrupulous since childhood and used to be a coppersmith. He is currently unemployed. His father hates him to the bone, so he stays in Shanghai and eats at his uncle's shop. Wang takes pity on his poverty and generously takes him in. Who knew that taking in a vicious person would cause harm and he would be murdered. It is truly tragic.</p>
<p>Songfa Suddenly Returns to the Shop to Ask for Clothes: The night before last, Wang went out to bathe. After the shop assistants finished closing up, they spent time playing cards for entertainment. Wang's wife, Jiang, was chatting upstairs with relatives and children when Songfa suddenly arrived at the shop. He first watched them play cards in the shop hall. Around 11 o'clock, Wang returned from his bath and went upstairs into the room. Songfa followed him up and said to his uncle, "The weather is getting colder, and I lack clothes. Please make me a cotton coat." Wang agreed. Songfa went downstairs to sleep. It was already late, and Wang and his wife undressed and went to bed together. His son, Xingbao, slept in another bed.</p>
<p>Three People Killed with a Hatchet: Around 2 o'clock in the morning, Songfa suddenly got up, took a hatchet used by the old clerks in the shop, went straight upstairs, pried open the door, and saw Wang and Jiang fast asleep. He immediately stepped forward and swung the hatchet, first striking Wang's head with a heavy blow, splitting it open. At the same time, he also struck Jiang with a blow, and blood flowed all over the bed. Jiang died on the spot, while Wang was still sitting up and resisting with his hands. Songfa immediately raised the hatchet and slashed wildly, severing all his fingers. At this time, Xingbao also woke up and shouted. Fearing that the matter would be revealed, Songfa turned around and struck Xingbao's head, killing him instantly. Seeing that all three were dead, Songfa pried open the silver box in the room and took over a hundred silver yuan. He also seized over fifty yuan from Wang's side and hurriedly went downstairs and escaped through the back door.</p>
<p>Tragic Case Only Discovered in the Morning: When the bloody case occurred, the shop assistants sleeping downstairs heard the noise but thought it was a quarrel between husband and wife and did not pay attention. They did not know anything when they opened the door in the morning. Later, Zhenyuan got up and entered the room and saw her parents dead on the bed and her brother dead on the ground. She was shocked and cried loudly. The shop assistants downstairs went upstairs to see and knew that a great disaster had occurred. They immediately reported it to the Huishan Police Station, which ordered Chinese and foreign detectives to investigate the scene. The shop assistants were all arrested and questioned. In the afternoon, the three corpses were taken to the forensic examination office on Feilun Road. The examination will be held the day after tomorrow on Sunday. A plaid duck-tongue cap that Wang Songfa usually wore was found at the time.</p>
<p>Wang Zhenyuan Fortunately Escapes: Of the four members of Wang Jiashun's family, three died tragically, which is heartbreaking to hear. Wang's daughter Zhenyuan was originally sleeping in the same room as her parents, but it happened that her father's niece-in-law had come to Shanghai that day and was temporarily sleeping on the third floor, otherwise she would have been harmed as well. It was a misfortune within a misfortune.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Father and Daughter-in-Law Commit Adultery, Violent Father Gouges Out Son's Eyes <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The World's Customs Are Declining, and Ethics Are Greatly Changed</p>
<p>Yang Tingchen Is Truly Old and Shameless</p>
<p>Actually Regards His Son as a Thorn in His Side</p>
<p>The Court Should Impose Severe Punishment</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the grass shed at No. 14 Xinqiao Road, in the jurisdiction of the Second District General Office in Nanshi, an incident occurred in which a father and daughter-in-law committed adultery, and the violent father suddenly became angry and tied his son to a wooden stake with an iron chain and gouged out his eyes with a sharp knife, a tragic scene unprecedented in the world. Fortunately, the chief of the Liyuan Road Police Station noticed it and rescued his son. The violent father and his accomplice were arrested on the spot. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Rearing Pigs to Make a Living: Yang Tingchen, from Funing, Jiangbei, is 52 years old. He came to Shanghai a few years ago and used to work as a rickshaw puller. Recently, due to his old age, he has been living in a grass shed at No. 34 Xinqiao Road, Nanshi, rearing piglets to make a living. Yang lost his wife at the age of 38 and only had one son, Yang Xiaotaozi, who is now 29 years old. He is a rickshaw puller and lives in a small boat in the Hebang of Xuxie Road. His wife, Gu, is now 31 years old. The father takes the place of the son. Gu came to Yang's family as a child bride at the age of seven. Xiaotaozi lost his mother at the age of fifteen and married Gu at the age of sixteen. However, his father Tingchen was able to take advantage of his son's youth and deceive him, and he had been a widower for many years, so he was sexually aroused and had an affair with Gu in secret, and he had tasted the flavor of a virgin before his son. Therefore, although the two young people were married in name, Tingchen actually took care of everything. Although Xiaotaozi knew that his father's actions were inappropriate, he was concerned about Gu's reputation once he spoke out, so he always tolerated it and did not speak out.</p>
<p>Accused of Insubordination: Although Yang Xiaotaozi repeatedly tolerated it, his father still wanted to take things further and regarded his son as a thorn in his side. He felt that he could not be happy until he removed him. Therefore, he did not hesitate to nitpick and find fault with everything. In June of this year, the father and son suddenly had a quarrel, and Tingchen actually filed a lawsuit against his son in the local court, accusing him of insubordination. However, the court at that time observed the ancient训 of there is no wrong parent in the world and sentenced Xiaotaozi to two months in prison.</p>
<p>Conspiring and Plotting: Two months passed in the blink of an eye, and Xiaotaozi was released from prison in August. Xiaotaozi then moved his wife Gu out to live separately in order to avoid his father's edge. Unexpectedly, after living peacefully for more than fifty days, Tingchen tried every means to lure Gu out and hide her without a trace. Although Xiaotaozi knew that his father had done it, he did not dare to question him. He could only feel depressed and searched everywhere when he was not pulling his rickshaw. Tingchen was afraid that it would eventually be revealed after a long time and that the trouble in his heart would be unavoidable. Therefore, evil thoughts suddenly arose, and he discussed a plan with his nephew-in-law Zhang Maohuzi (i.e., Zhang Jinkui) and decided to carry it out.</p>
<p>Lured to the Grass Shed: At about 5:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, Zhang Jinkui went to Xuxie Road to meet Xiaotaozi and falsely claimed that his father Tingchen had been searching for his missing daughter-in-law for days without success. He was very anxious and now wanted to go to Tingchen's place to discuss a proper plan and search together to achieve quick results. Xiaotaozi then followed Zhang there. Unexpectedly, as soon as he entered the grass shed, Tingchen's anger was evident, and he saw Yang Bingxing (a 61-year-old beggar) of the same clan sitting there. The father and son had not said a word when Tingchen ordered Zhang Jinkui to help tie Xiaotaozi tightly to a wooden stake that had been planted in advance with an iron chain.</p>
<p>Actually Commits a Heinous Crime: After Tingchen and Jinkui had tied up Xiaotaozi, the two of them sat opposite each other and drank heavily to enhance their mood. It was not until 11:00 p.m., when it was late at night and quiet, that Xiaotaozi saw that the situation was not good and was about to shout for help. However, as soon as he opened his mouth, Tingchen threw lime into his throat, causing Xiaotaozi to be unable to speak. Then, Tingchen used a sharp knife for trimming water chestnuts to gouge out Xiaotaozi's eyes and embedded lime in the eye sockets. Xiaotaozi's pain pierced his heart, and he had no way to call for help and could only leave it to fate.</p>
<p>Patrol Officer Investigates: After Xiaotaozi's eyes were gouged out, Tingchen threatened him, saying that he had to falsely accuse someone of murder, otherwise he would be put to death. Unexpectedly, while he was gloating, Patrol Officer Wang Shengshan of the Liyuan Road Police Station of the Second District General Office, along with Chief Police Shen Chuanxian, were patrolling and heard extremely painful cries from shed No. 14. They went inside to inspect and saw a man tied to a wooden stake with his eyes gouged out and covered in blood. They were shocked and immediately arrested Tingchen and his party and took them all to the Second District General Office.</p>
<p>Escorted to the Court: When Chief Ling of the district heard that such a shocking case of unnatural injury had occurred in his jurisdiction, he immediately conducted a preliminary hearing. First, Xiaotaozi tearfully recounted his experience. Then, according to Tingchen's confession, his son had said that he would harm him with an axe (Tingchen referred to himself) as soon as he was released in August. On the 24th of this month, because his eldest grandson had a stomachache and was crying, his son and daughter-in-law had a quarrel, and his daughter-in-law had fled without a trace. Today, he brought his rebellious son home, and in a moment of anger, he gouged out his eyes. After Chief Ling finished the interrogation, he considered that the case was serious and immediately prepared a document to send it to the court for punishment according to the law.</p>

"Did you see how many people were at the entrance of the Fifth District?" "Seven or eight hundred people." "What were they doing?" "I don't know." "Did you hear what they said in their mouths?" "I'm deaf, I don't know." "When you were investigating, how did you say you were beaten down in the Fifth District?" "I didn't say that." "I've been asking you for a long time. Even if you're not deaf, it doesn't matter if you said a slogan." "I don't know." "Are you willing to file a lawsuit after you were injured?" "I want to file a lawsuit." "Who fired the gun?" "I don't know." "Did you hear many gunshots?" "I heard them." At this point, the official asked the injured person</p>
<p>Shen Xikun, 24 years old, from Changzhou, a coppersmith living at 22 Tianjili, Xianshan Road, was asked, "Do you know Wang Xiangshou?" "I don't know him." "Where were you injured?"

"Which side of the Fifth District were you shot?" "Across from the Fifth District, at the corner of the market." "Did the gun come from the Fifth District or from the road?" "It came from the Fifth District." "Were there people in front of you?" "I saw a lot of people, so I walked across the street." "What happened after you were injured?" "I entered a clothing store." "What is the name of the store?" "I was dizzy at the time, I don't know." "How did you know you went to the hospital?" "The people in the clothing store sent me to the hospital." "Which hospital did you go to?" "I first went to Jisheng Hospital, but I couldn't get the bullet out, so I went to Tongren Hospital." "Did they take it out?" "They took it out." "Where is Tongren Hospital?" "Across from Peng Road, near the triangular vegetable market." "Did you see the bullet after it was taken out?" "I saw it." "What did it look like?" "It was long, like a finger, about half as long." "When the tailor sent you there, he should have known the name." "I didn't know, and I couldn't speak when I got to Tongren Hospital." "Where did the bullet come from?" "It came from inside the Fifth District." "Who fired it?" "The police." "Do you have a store next to the Fifth District?" "I don't have one." "Why did you say before that the store was next to the Fifth District, and you were shot when you came out of Tianjili? Why is that not right now?" "How many people did you see in the Fifth District?" "More than three thousand people." "Why were they there?" "I don't know." "What did you hear the thousands of people saying?" "They were saying that the district chief dragged the person who posted the slogans in." "Is there anything else?" "Everyone was talking about what was going on in the district, and they wanted to drag the person who posted the slogans in." At this point, the official asked the injured person</p>

<p>A coppersmith working at Lian'an Electric Company in Huangpu Wharf, Yangshupu. He lives at 46 Yipinyiwu. The official asked, "Where is Yipinyiwu?" He replied, "Baoshan Road, Qiujiang Road." "What time did you pass by the Fifth District that day?" "October 1st, 7 or 8 p.m." "How many people were walking?" "I was walking alone to find a friend on Xiangshan Road." "Did you walk past the Fifth District?" "There were many people, so I couldn't walk past. I waited a while, and a long-distance bus came. I thought someone had been killed by the bus, so I went to take a look and heard someone shout, 'Fire!'." "Who shouted, 'Fire'?" "The district chief. Later, he also stomped his feet and shouted, 'Fire!' and the bullets came." "Where did they hit you?" "In the foot." "Where were you standing?" "Five or six steps from the entrance of the district." "Were there people in front of you?" "There was a line of people." "How many were there?" "I don't know." "Where did you go later?" "After I was injured, I saw a rickshaw at the entrance of the alley and called it home." "Did you go to the hospital?" "I went to Jisheng Hospital." "Who sent you there?" "My family sent me there. Later, I also went to Tongren Hospital." "Was the bullet taken out?" "I don't know." "Did you ask the doctor later?" "He said it wasn't taken out. Now, a cut has been made in the inner thigh, but it hasn't been taken out." "Are you willing to file a lawsuit after being injured?" "I'm disabled, I want to file a lawsuit." "Did the gun come from the front or the back?" "It came from the front. I wanted to escape, so the bullet hit my foot." "Did you want to escape alone or did everyone want to escape?" "Everyone escaped." At this point, the official asked lawyer Zhang Chongding why the deceased Cai Bingquan and Shen Yan's family had not arrived.</p>
<p>Lawyer Zhang replied, "The day after the first hearing, the private prosecution was settled out of court with conditions. The family of the deceased took the money and immediately returned to Shaoxing and cannot come to court." "Where was the settlement?" "The Municipal Party Department." He then presented a letter stating that they had been relieved of their commission and had also filed a petition to withdraw the case. The official then checked the petition and stated that it stated that they were requesting to withdraw the complaint and were not filing a lawsuit. "But this is a public prosecution and cannot be withdrawn." "This was done by the Municipal Party Department." "How do you know it was signed by the Municipal Party Department?" "A relative of Cai Bingzhong, surnamed Xu, told me." "Does the Municipal Party Department manage this part of the injured people?" "No." "Was the petition written by the Municipal Party Department?" "Yes." "Who took out the money for the private settlement?" "The Municipal Party Department said that the municipal government took it out." "How much money?" "Each person took 1,300 yuan in cash, and each person also received a savings deposit of 3,500 yuan with a term of ten years." At this point, the official ordered You Boli and the patrol officers Qing Xiang, Wu Maolin, Liu Weicheng, Wu Zhanyou, and Qiao Xuechang to the case and then</p>
<p>Asked You Boli, "Did you fire the gun that day in the courtyard?" "Yes." "What kind of gun did you fire?" "A Mauser pistol." "How did you fire it?" "I ordered it to be fired into the sky to scare them." "Where did the two people die?" "One with a back injury died far to the east, and one died in front of the district. But please allow me to say a few words." The official allowed it. You said, "I am responsible for the safety and order of the Fifth District and for the firearms of the Public Security Bureau. They were shouting slogans and wanted to rob military equipment. If the area is disturbed or something uncontrollable happens, do I have to defend it? If I take legitimate defense, is the district chief guilty? As for posting slogans, not only did I explain it to them, but they should have dispersed. If they thought the district chief or the brothers were wrong, why did they want to rob the gun?" The official asked, "Are the bullets you fired from the Mauser pistol round or long?" "Long." At this point, You also claimed that on the evening of October 3rd, hooligans impersonated students from China Public School and shouted slogans to overthrow You Boli. At that time, I had been detained in the Public Security Bureau. They rushed into the Fifth District to question the patrol officers. They were not giving lectures at the entrance of Jinderli and distributing flyers. Ge Yongqing and Shi Tifen reported to the Sixth District Party Department. There were reports the next day that could prove it. "So I have been wronged for two months. I request bail." The official said, "Bail is not allowed. Whether you are guilty or not has not yet been pronounced." At this point, the official declared that although Cai Bingzhong and Shen Yan's family had not arrived, the case would still be transferred. Another injured person, Luo Fusheng, had never arrived, and the summons to Zhang Baolin could not be delivered either and should be summoned again. The case still needs to be transferred to witnesses and investigated further, so the case cannot be concluded. Therefore, he ordered each defendant to sign and be remanded in custody, and announced the adjournment of the court.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Yangsi Township Bandits Kill Two <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Victims Cut Off Bandits' Retreat</p>
<p>Leading to Dozens of Gunshots</p>
<p>Robbery Also Occurs at Wangjia Bridge</p>
<p>Authorities Are Now Strictly Pursuing the Robbers</p>
<p>In Pudong's Yangsi Township (Shangyi Ninth District), farmer Lu Miaogen's house, number seven in Lujia Residence, was suddenly invaded by a large gang of over twenty bandits at approximately one o'clock last night. Each held handguns, knives, and clubs, lying in ambush around the Lu residence. Several of the bandits were wearing blue cloth short shirts and trousers, speaking in a Jiangbei accent. They crashed into the house, and the Lu family, men, women, old, and young, were startled awake from their sleep, immediately driven into a corner and silenced in fear. The bandits then rummaged through boxes and chests, looting approximately sixty yuan in cash, paper money, and foreign currency, several land deeds, and four gold earrings. Dissatisfied with the small amount of loot, they simultaneously broke into the nearby Yang Zhaogui's house at number twelve, searching and looting. Yang seized the opportunity to escape through a side door, joining Miaogen, his son Fujin, and his cousin Abaobao, totaling four people, and ran to the stone bridge embankment behind the residence to wait (this was the bandits' only way back), intending to arrest them. Unexpectedly, the bandits guarding the bridge had already noticed them and violently slashed Miaogen's forehead with a knife, causing brain matter and blood to gush out like a spring. Another bandit immediately fired a gun, with continuous cracking and banging sounds, totaling forty to fifty shots. Miaogen was struck by six or seven bullets in his waist and immediately fell to the ground, dead. Yang Zhaogui suffered two gunshot wounds each to his left wrist and waist. Lu's cousin, Abaobao, had his foot pierced by a bullet. Lu's son, Fujin, was shot in two places on his left thigh and the back of his foot, both collapsing and unable to move. Seeing that they had injured and killed the victims, the bandits fled south and escaped. At dawn, the Lu family carried the injured to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. However, Yang Zhaogui's injuries were fatal, and he had already died upon arrival at the hospital and was carried back home. Abaobao and Fujin's injuries were light and not life-threatening. At nine o'clock yesterday morning, Officer Li, from the Yangsi Bridge Third District Third Precinct police station, reported the incident. The station then relayed the information to the Public Security Bureau, using the telephone to inform all district stations and teams to strictly pursue the stolen goods and bandits. The deceased, Lu Miaogen, was fifty-five years old, and Yang Zhaogui was thirty-six years old, both local residents. Their bodies had not yet been collected by evening. It was also heard that robbery cases occurred at Wangjia Bridge, where the border between the Second District of Shangyi and Nanyi is located, and near Zhuangjia Temple (Nanyi) on the same night. The victims' names have not yet been identified. Yesterday at dawn, the Beicai Town Security Corps intercepted three bandits and a package of stolen clothes, waiting for the victims to identify them.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Fierce Kidnappers Still Attempt to Flee After Being Shot <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Public Security Bureau Officer Captures Zhejiang Secret Agent Who Came to Shanghai to Arrest Bandits</p>
<p>Not Following Police Station Procedures</p>
<p>Ordered to Pay Bail and Be Available for Summons</p>
<p>Recently, Zhejiang Provincial Government Security Department secret agent Liu Ruibiao learned that Guo Abiao, a wanted kidnapping kingpin from Shaoxing, Zhejiang Province, had repeatedly committed kidnapping and extortion, resisted arrest, and injured people in Zhejiang. He had fled to the Shanghai Concession and gathered followers, planning to strike again. Therefore, he specifically reported to the Security Department Director and prepared official documents, coordinating with the First District Court and the Public Concession Police Department to assist the secret agent in apprehending him upon his arrival in Shanghai. Liu then brought his detective partners, Cui Huisheng, etc., from Hangzhou to Shanghai a few days ago, strictly investigating the bandit leader's whereabouts. The day before yesterday, at dusk, they learned that Guo Abiao was hiding in the Rongsheng Hotel in Puqing Lane, Fujian Road. Liu, without following the usual procedure of first submitting the official documents to the First Special Court and the relevant police station for assistance, immediately assigned his partners Liu Jinbiao, Wang Asi, and Ying Huisan to rush to the Rongsheng Hotel and arrest Guo. The three men reported back to Liu Ruibiao, with one person escorting Guo the bandit elsewhere. Unexpectedly, as soon as they left the Rongsheng Hotel, Guo, relying on his strength, resisted slightly and immediately broke free and fled. Since the captured bandit had escaped, they pursued him relentlessly. They chased one another until the intersection of Fujian Road and Fuzhou Road. The pursuers saw two Chinese constables, numbers 3280 and 3327, standing guard there and shouted for help to catch a thief. The two constables bravely assisted upon hearing the call, but Guo was extremely agile and moved quickly, making it difficult to catch him. The pursuer then took out a handgun and shot at Guo. The two constables also fired one shot each, but all missed. Guo then ran south quickly. At the intersection of Guangdong Road, the two constables fired one shot each again, and Guo was hit by a bullet and collapsed. The pursuers thought he could be captured, but Guo, enduring the pain, jumped up and continued running forward, disappearing in an instant. Fortunately, at that moment, a public security bureau detective, Han, was eating at a dim sum shop at number 275 Guangdong Road and saw a person suddenly rush into a store at number 234 and saw constables chasing him, so he also put down his chopsticks and assisted in the pursuit. When Guo the bandit ran out of the back door of number 234 and fled into Jiu'an Lane, Detective Han happened to be there and intercepted him. The two Chinese constables then arrived. However, the detective partner who was escorting Guo the bandit was nowhere to be found. After a long wait, he did not appear. The two constables then took Guo to the Lao Zha gate police station. The police chief, seeing that Guo was injured, immediately sent Detective Wang Shanxiang to the hospital for treatment. According to Guo's statement to Detective Wang, his name was Ying Dalong, originally from Shaoxing, and Detective Wang temporarily suspended the inquiry about why he was being chased because the doctor urgently needed to treat him. At 9:30 PM, Liu Ruibiao, the secret agent from Hangzhou, having learned that Guo had been captured, brought the official documents and his partner Cui Jinsheng to the Lao Zha gate police station. He stated that the person who had been arrested was the bandit leader Guo Abiao, not Ying Dalong. He also said that after Guo was arrested at the Rongsheng Hotel, he was escorted by Liu Jinbiao, and that Liu Jinbiao had shouted for help and fired the gun when he escaped. The police chief then ordered Detective Wang to go to the hospital again to question the injured person in detail, but he still denied that his name was Guo Abiao and said that the person who chased him and fired the gun was named Wang Asi, not Liu Jinbiao. Detective Wang immediately reported the situation to the police chief for verification. The police chief believed that according to precedent, when mainland government officials arrest criminals in the concession, they should first notify the police station. Since the secret agent did not follow this procedure, his actions could not be considered legal. He detained Liu Ruibiao and Cui Jinsheng. The box cannon, twenty-six bullets, and gun license carried by Liu, as well as the handgun and seventeen bullets carried by Cui, were temporarily confiscated. Yesterday morning, they were all sent to the First Special District Court, where Judge Xu of the Criminal Division conducted a preliminary hearing. The police station lawyer, Ru BaoYi, explained the situation and requested the court to verify whether the injured person denied that his name was Guo Abiao, and if the Zhejiang government officials wanted to identify him as the bandit leader, they should provide evidence to prove it. As for the secret agent's procedural errors, he requested the court to verify them. According to Liu Ruibiao's confession, the person captured was indeed the kidnapping bandit leader Guo Abiao, who had committed numerous crimes in Zhejiang. In addition to kidnapping and extortion, he had also plotted to capture and kill escorts the year before. After the interrogation by Judge Xu, Liu and Cui were released on bail and ordered to be available for summons. At the next court session, Liu Jinbiao and the other three people should be brought to the court, and evidence should be presented to prove that the injured person was indeed Guo Abiao, who had committed crimes, for verification.</p>

<p>Handgun and Uniform Taken With Him</p>
<p>Stolen Bicycle Recovered</p>
<p>Chinese Constable Zhang Shaoquan, number 2750 from the Putuo Road police station, a native of Shandong, was assigned by the police chief to patrol the Aomen Road area on the morning of the 2nd at 11:00 AM. He has not returned since, and his handgun and uniform are missing. The police chief ordered people to search for him at number 143 Maigen Lane, Maigen Road, but they said that he has not returned for several days. On the 22nd of last month, a bicycle was lost in transit. The Chinese constable is highly suspected of this. The day before yesterday, the police station's driver, Hua Ayu, recovered the stolen bicycle from Cui Xuesi's house, number 30 Hengtong Road, Zhabei. He reported this to the police chief, who sent Chinese detective Shen Dehui and a Western detective to the Public Security Bureau to investigate. They arrested Cui Xuesi at number 30 Hengtong Road and brought him and the bicycle back to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police station's lawyer explained the situation and requested an extension for further investigation into the Chinese constable's whereabouts. Under questioning by Judge Feng Shide, the defendant was ordered to remain in custody and the hearing was postponed.</p>

<p>Old Father Hangs Himself</p>
<p>Zhang Yougen, a villager from Zhangjia Residence on the Shanghai-Minhang-Nanzhe Road in the southwest countryside, is nearly forty years old and has only one daughter named Zhao Di, who is eighteen years old. Since she was young, she has been betrothed to Huang Shengyun, a tailor from nearby Zhujia Lane. Although Zhao Di is not beautiful, she likes to dress up. Last year, she asked her father to dissolve the engagement with the Huang family, but Yougen refused, causing Zhao Di to be unhappy. This spring, during the Qingming Festival, Zhao Di used the excuse of going to her relatives' house to sweep the tombs and entered a Buddhist temple as a nun. After repeated questioning by the old nun, she revealed the truth. The nun then notified Yougen to take her back home. The Huang family, learning about this, feared that it would affect the engagement and chose yesterday as the wedding date. However, Zhao Di refused to comply and repeatedly made things difficult for her father. Knowing that she could not change the situation, she ran away alone on the morning of the 2nd of this month while her family was asleep. After his beloved daughter ran away, Yougen asked people to search for her everywhere, but to no avail. The Huang family also gathered many people to demand an explanation. Affected by this, Yougen had the thought of ending his life. The night before last, he hanged himself while people were not paying attention. His wife, Cai, noticed it early and quickly rescued him, giving him ginger soup, and he recovered. Relatives are now mediating between the two families and dissolving the Zhang-Huang engagement. They are also posting notices to find Zhao Di and bring her home to prevent her from wandering elsewhere.</p>

<p>Combined With Nameless Head</p>
<p>At 11:45 AM on the 1st of this month, Liu Qingxiang, a minor worker number two from the Public Works Department Health Bureau, discovered the severed head of an infant next to a trash can at number 165 in a lane near Parker Road. Liu reported this to the Xinzha police station, who ordered detectives to investigate. The infant's head was sent to the Philan Road mortuary for examination. The next morning, Prosecutor Guo from the First Special Court arrived at the mortuary for examination and ordered it to be temporarily handed over to the forensic doctor for preservation. As reported previously, Chinese constables number 1065 and 347 of the police station passed by Mahou Road at approximately 4:00 AM on the 29th of last month and saw a Chinese man carrying a box and abandoning it on the east side of the road before fleeing. However, the two constables did not suspect that there was a headless infant corpse inside. The box was later transported back to the Putuo Mountain Villa Mortuary by the Dachang rear police station. The discovery of a head led to a thorough investigation, and they transferred the box back from Dachang to inspect it, confirming that there was a headless infant corpse inside. The corpse was immediately sent to the mortuary. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Guo from the Special Court arrived at the mortuary for examination. Forensic doctor Wei Ligong and the Public Works Department doctor stated that the head was indeed severed from the corpse and confirmed that it was a Chinese girl. Mr. Guo also questioned the two Chinese constables. He then ordered that the corpse of the unnamed female infant who had died and had been examined should be combined with the previously examined unnamed head and handed over to the Pushan Mountain Villa for burial. The police station is strictly pursuing the murderer and will investigate and punish them.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Large Quantity of Military Supplies Discovered in Cement on Sandboat <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Shao Weijun, a 54-year-old from Ganyu, opened the Sanxin Company at No. 5 Alley, Muming Lane, Cuifeng Street, Nanshi. Yesterday at about 1:00 PM, Xu Jishi, the captain of the Municipal Public Security Bureau's water patrol team, led detectives Wang Jiheng and other police officers to discover a Mauser pistol, 118 bullets, two opium lamps, and eight opium bubbles under a clothing box on the second floor of the building. Captain Xu strictly questioned the whereabouts of the large quantity of cement brought in. It was reported that it had been transported to the sandboat on the Pubin side opposite the First District Headquarters at Maojia Alley. The two men, along with the seized evidence, were taken to the First District and then back to the team. Then, under the direction of the men, the police officers took a boat to the sandboat indicated by Xian Zuoqing and opened the approximately twenty barrels of cement one by one. After more than an hour, they discovered thirty-one Mauser pistols, two two-inch Lejia guns, two Mauser pistols, one Browning pistol, and 3,020 bullets in four of the barrels. The entire collection was taken back to the team. Captain Xu believed that the case was extremely serious and immediately brought Xian Yin and the two men in for a preliminary hearing. Shao Weijun confessed that the military supplies were actually transported by customers Xian Zuoqing and a Mr. Li, and that he did not know the real situation. Xian Zuoqing, 38 years old, from Juzhou, Shandong, confessed that the military supplies were purchased by his friend Li Xiuchen and five other people and mixed into the cement barrels. They were transported to Juzhou on a sandboat. He only bought one large and one small gun, along with the ones he bought in Yemen, and transported them back to his hometown for self-defense. They had spent a lot of effort coming up with this secret method of smuggling guns, but they never expected to be discovered. They usually smoked opium in the Taixin Hotel in the French Concession. Detectives were immediately dispatched to the Taixin Hotel to arrest those people, but they had already fled. Captain Xu ordered a document to be prepared and had Xian Zuoqing and Shao Weijun, along with the seized military supplies and opium, sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for questioning and punishment.</p>

<p>The entire Shanghai raw cattle and sheep leather industry was outraged by the harsh implementation of the raw cattle and sheep leather export inspection rules issued by the Commodity Inspection Bureau without the consent of the leather merchants. Therefore, a general meeting was held at the Leather Merchants Association on Beihai Road at 5:00 PM yesterday. More than 40 people attended the meeting. Chairman Zhu, as well as Song Zigang, a representative from the Dangyouli Foreign Firm, and Wu Liangmei, a representative from the Shenyu Foreign Firm, reported that the export of supported buffalo leather that had been agreed upon by both the buyer and seller was repeatedly hindered by the Inspection Bureau, which refused to release it, resulting in missed shipping dates and heavy losses. The attendees were even more indignant upon hearing this report. They all believed that raw cattle and sheep leather was not comparable to silk flowers and did not require inspection. However, out of respect for the government, they made concessions and paid for the inspection. Now, the bureau's inspection methods are so harsh that they affect the leather merchants' capital. It is necessary to demand reform. It was unanimously decided to appoint six fellow merchants, including Mr. Zhu, as representatives to go to the Inspection Bureau to petition at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 5th). If the bureau cannot provide a satisfactory response, they will go to the Ministry of Industry in the capital to petition. At that time, all the facts of the bureau's violation of commercial sentiment will be published in the newspaper.</p>

<h3 id="e135">Reader Communication: Three Notices to All Readers of Reader Correspondence <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Research on Ma Zhanshan</p>
<p>All readers highly respect General Ma Zhanshan. Some have written letters expressing gratitude and weeping tears of gratitude. Some have pawned clothes and sold property to donate to the military. Some have traveled far together, willing to risk their lives to rescue him. This shows that the people's hearts are not dead and justice is clear. In fact, General Ma Zhanshan is only fulfilling his duty. As the military officer in charge of border defense, he naturally has the responsibility to defend the territory and resist the enemy. General Ma's great admiration by the people is only because he is in an atmosphere of non-resistance. Suddenly, he is even more pleasing and admirable, almost prostrate.</p>
<p>I hope that readers will not just say a few good words about Ma Zhanshan and shed a few drops of hot tears. At least, they must further study the following questions:</p>
<p>(1) In this time of national crisis, why is Ma Zhanshan and his subordinates the only ones who resist the enemy and are not afraid of death?</p>
<p>(2) What kind of education was Ma Zhanshan raised in?</p>
<p>(3) Can the current general education raise Ma Zhanshan?</p>
<p>I heard that Ma Zhanshan has not read many books and knows few words. He came from the ranks and rose step by step to his current position as a low-level and mid-level military officer. Not only is new education completely out of the question, but old education also has little relationship. I think the only education he received was novels, ballads, and dramas, or the stories of loyalty, filial piety, and integrity passed down by the elders in his hometown. He has actually done a great job of defending the country and winning glory. A general who advocates non-resistance, although he did not graduate from a certain university, is still a college student. Is there still a lot to consider about whether the old morality and old culture that today's celebrities despise should be overthrown and kicked over with one punch and one kick?</p>
<p>What we usually believe in is not science saving the country? Thinking of the smashing of theocracy and the abandonment of ethics, is not the rule of law spirit to replace them in the future? The publicity of general celebrities in words and the promotion of tongues ultimately boils down to this. Today, Ma Zhanshan is a lone army in a desperate situation, using a small number of troops and a few remaining weapons to resist Japan's all-out army, and he is surrounded by a vast and unhelpful situation. From a scientific point of view, there is no chance of survival, only surrender to seek survival. Even with the rule of law spirit, there are leaders who advocate non-resistance and precedents of giving up and retreating. Is it illegal to act on orders? Ma Zhanshan's actions are simply not tolerated by scientists' logic and not dreamed of by those who advocate the rule of law, but he is praised by the general public with congratulatory telegrams for "awakening the national soul for China and regaining the national character for the nation." Then, is it only advocating science and the rule of law, if not the problem of right and wrong, I am afraid there is still not enough problem.</p>
<p>I know that there are many Ma Zhanshans in the Northeast Army in addition to Officer Ma Zhanshan, and there are still many Ma Zhanshans in officers everywhere. They are only suppressed by general non-resistance leaders, so there is no opportunity to use their talents and become famous. We ordinary people have no private relationship with Ma Zhanshan and are ready to transport unlimited amounts of hot blood and bitter tears to the emerging hundreds of millions of Ma Zhanshans. The tyrant has no desire. If the good men and good citizens do not take this opportunity to perform meritorious service and serve the country, when will they wait? I ask all the readers of Reader Correspondence, if you all agree with my words? In addition to replying to the letters separately, public announcements will be temporarily suspended for the next few days. Sincerely,</p>

<h3 id="e138">Letter to the Editor <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>I am writing in response to a report in your esteemed newspaper on the 5th of this month regarding the handover of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps First Regiment. The report stated that I dispatched Wang Chengzhi and Tong Xianglong, leading over a hundred men, to surround the regiment headquarters, oversee the regiment commander, and coerce the handover. It further alleged that I apologized to the regiment commander, which I found utterly astonishing upon reading.</p>
<p>Upon investigation, the reorganization of our army is a matter concerning the entire army, not merely the First Regiment. The authority to transfer officials rests with the committee and cannot be unilaterally exercised by any single individual. Furthermore, due to my limited abilities and the burden of other duties, I have already submitted my resignation to the committee. I did not even attend the meeting yesterday, so there is no basis for the alleged apology to the regiment commander.</p>
<p>The matter is entirely fabricated, and I fear that the public may be misled and confused, thereby distorting the truth. Therefore, I am writing this letter to clarify the situation and hope that you will publish it in your newspaper to shed light on the truth.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Chen Ya-fu</p>

<p>The Shanghai Secondary School Progressive Association sent two telegrams yesterday as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Telegram to the Nanjing National Government and the Nanjing Special Diplomatic Committee: (Beginning Omitted) "The violent Japanese occupation of the Eastern Provinces has exceeded two months. The government has repeatedly declared that it would resist to the death and would never retreat if the enemy advanced further. Recently, Japanese atrocities have intensified. The government has surprisingly proposed recognizing Jinzhou as a neutral zone and Tianjin as an international co-managed area, and there are reports of direct negotiations with Japan. If this is the case, then there could be no greater loss of rights and humiliation to the nation, which completely contradicts the government's previous repeated statements and the will of the people to resist Japan with force. Our people are deeply puzzled by the government's attitude and hereby telegraph this statement, respectfully requesting a clear announcement to inform the people of the country." The Shanghai Secondary School Progressive Association respectfully bows. (End Omitted)</p>
<p>(2) Telegram to Minister Gu of the Nanjing Ministry of Foreign Affairs: (Beginning Omitted) "Since you, Minister, have been in charge of diplomacy, the League of Nations has conceded to Japan in every matter. Recently, there have even been proposals to designate Jinzhou as a neutral zone and Tianjin as an international co-managed area, and there are reports of direct negotiations. If this is the case, then it would be an even greater loss of rights and humiliation to the nation, violating the will of the people more so than Cao, Lu, and Zhang. Although the nation is weak, the hearts of the people are not dead. We hope that you will awaken and strive to the death to resist, and not succumb to pressure. We dare to offer this loyal advice, hoping that you will carefully consider it." The Shanghai Secondary School Progressive Association respectfully bows.</p>

<p>Result: 1 to 2</p>
<p>Shanghai Team Wins with Ten Men</p>
<p>Jinan entered the Senior Cup competition for the first time yesterday, meeting the Shanghai team at the China Baseball Field. The game was intense. Despite the prestige of Jinan, the result was disappointing. They succumbed to the ten-man Shanghai team with a score of 1 to 2. The audience of over 4,000 spectators left disappointed. Referee: Lei Tu.</p>

<p>O Soul, Return!</p>
<p>The Jinan team, recognized as the pride of the football world, suffered a defeat to Lincoln the other day, reducing their hopes in the Group A competition. Yesterday, they suffered another setback, with their prospects in the Shanghai Senior Cup cut short. Has their football luck run out? Has their artistry deteriorated? Both seem to be the case. Considering yesterday's match, the Shanghai team has always been in the ranks of mediocre teams. Even if Jinan's victory could not be as easy as turning their hand, they should have been able to handle it with ease. However, the reality was contradictory, suffering a bitter defeat of 2 to 1. Moreover, it occurred during the absence of the famous Shanghai player Sinclair due to injury. Such a good opportunity yielded such a result, which is even more upsetting. Although victory and defeat are common occurrences, the Jinan athletes should gather their courage and strive to restore their reputation and demonstrate their great spirit, thereby grasping the leadership of Shanghai football. This failure may well be the mother of future success.</p>
<p>A Blessing in Disguise</p>
<p>Mr. Sinclair, the mainstay of the Shanghai team, left the field due to injury, causing turmoil throughout the team. The victory in fighting with ten men was unexpected. The strict defense and solid goalkeeper made it extremely difficult to break through. The loss of one goal and the result of the penalty kick was not their fault. There was not much activity from the forwards, but their style was quite fierce, and their shots were quite rare, but it was commendable that two actually hit the target. If Jinan had a reliable goalkeeper, at least one of the two goals could have been saved, and the Shanghai team would have been satisfied with a tie. How could they have achieved an excess of triumph?</p>
<p>Impending Disaster</p>
<p>The Shanghai team's ball progress was unsuccessful with several attacks. Liu Zukan was seen rushing in from the left wing, passing to the center. Chen Zhenhe took the opportunity to shoot twice, but both times failed to hit the target. Qiu Dongyan also added a shot, but it was still ineffective. Subsequently, Mei Hongbao picked out Liu Zukan, who headed the ball in front of the goal, creating a big wave. Jinan was unable to find a gap to enter the net. After thirty minutes, Qiu Dongyan kicked and injured Sinclair's leg, and he fell to the ground, and his injuries were serious. Spectators mostly criticized Qiu for his non-rule-following behavior. The Shanghai team suffered this major incident and had no time to attack, but worked hard on defense to avoid losses. Faping's two rescues were of great merit. The first half ended 0 to 0.</p>
<p>Good and Bad Turn Upside Down</p>
<p>The second half started. In less than two minutes, Qiu Dongyan scored a penalty kick. The ball hit the post and bounced in from the head of a defender. According to the Shanghai team's inner guard, the penalty kick was very unjust, because the ball hit his chest, not his arm. Jinan continued to occupy the field, but unfortunately could not penetrate deeply to break through the defenses. Once, Liu Zukan kicked a corner kick that landed in a critical position. Chen Zhenhe headed it out, and the ball flew towards the goal. The Shanghai goalkeeper jumped up and hit it out. Only someone with skill could have done this. The situation suddenly changed. Hui Shimulun kicked casually from 30 yards away. Goalkeeper Wen failed to catch it securely, and the ball rolled into the net. Shanghai tied the score 1 to 1, and their spirits were boosted. Soon, Mo Lei scored another goal. Jinan made efforts to counterattack. Under tense circumstances, the Shanghai goalkeeper snatched the ball and eliminated the danger. Finally, there was almost another penalty kick in the Shanghai penalty area, but because there was no evidence, it was changed to a throw. As a result, Shanghai won against Jinan 2 to 1 and advanced to the second week of the Senior Cup.</p>

<p>Six to One Central is No Match</p>
<p>Guanghua and Public School Unfortunate Conflict</p>
<p>Jinan's Holding of the Future is Postponed</p>
<p>Jiangda's football match yesterday was the second week, and Jiaotong University defeated Central University with a score of 6 to 1. The battle between Guanghua and Zhonggong broke up unhappily due to misunderstandings and conflicts, and even entered a fistfight. The second half was not continued, which is unfortunate. Jinan's match against Zhizhi was postponed.</p>
<p>Jiaotong Greatly Defeats Central</p>
<p>Six to One</p>
<p>Jiaotong University and Central University held the game at Jiaotong University in Xuhui. Jiaotong took full advantage of the fierce attack and pressure. In the first half, Jiaotong led 2 to 0. In the second half, Jiaotong continued to score 5 to 0. At this time, Central only scored one goal. Jiaotong ended the game with a score of 6 to 1. Jiaotong's scorers: (1) Wan Mian (2) Liu Ximeng (3) Liu Ximeng (4) Chen Yong (5) Liu Ximeng (6) Chen Yong. Zhong Xiuqing scored for Central.</p>
<p>Guanghua and Public School Bleeding</p>
<p>One to One in the First Half and a Big Fight Breaks Out</p>
<p>The battle between Guanghua and Public School was held in Guanghua. Guanghua scored a goal first in the first half, and Zhonggong made it 1 to 1 to equalize. Later, Guanghua's striker had a fierce collision with Zhonggong's defender, and the cheering classmates' emotions were aroused, causing resentment. The spectators and the spectators first took action, and it affected Zhonggong's management and players, resulting in a big fight and causing a bloody tragedy. The second half was not continued and they dispersed unhappily. It is also an ugly phenomenon in Jiangda.</p>

<p>— Yanzi</p>
<p>During the Jiawu Korean incident, relations between China and Japan deteriorated. In the battles of Incheon and Pyongyang, only Nie Shicheng's army fought valiantly against the Japanese army. However, the only one who was praised at the time was Zuo Baogui, who defended Pyongyang and died in a bloody battle. In fact, Nie's bravery and skill in battle were no less than Zuo's. After the incident was settled, Ye Zhichao and Wei Rugui were both convicted and imprisoned for the collapse of their armies. Li Hongzhang knew Nie's reliability well, and still relied on him, promoting him to the Governor of Zhili and leading the Wuwei Vanguard Army, alongside Dong Fuxiang, Yuan Shikai, and others, as a strong general in the new army. In the autumn of the Gengzi year, the Boxer Rebellion broke out in Tianjin. The Red Lantern women's corps were rampant for a time, and passersby looked sideways. The five ministers who were superstitious welcomed them with open arms. Dong Fuxiang, who led a large army, was especially devoted. Only Nie Shicheng's army remained unmoved. The Boxers who disturbed his defense area were wiped out without exception. The bandits hated him deeply, but there was nothing they could do. When the Eight-Nation Alliance invaded Tianjin, Nie led his troops to defend the key points. At that time, the vanguard of the Allied forces was the Japanese and German armies. Nie was not afraid of the powerful enemy and resisted valiantly, fighting in the Yangliuqing area. Nie's efforts allowed the two palaces to escape to the west. Seeing that Nie's army was resisting the enemy, the bandits secretly attacked from behind. Nie led his troops to divide their forces and engage in battle. Later, with exhausted ammunition and no reinforcements, the entire army was annihilated. Nie also died in battle with multiple bullets in his body. Those who heard it lamented. Alas, Nie Shicheng, as a warrior, was able to know the big picture, not be confused by the Boxer bandits, and not be subdued by the powerful enemy. He fought a bloody battle with a lone army and died for his country. Compared with Dong Fuxiang and others who did not know the order of things and left behind a stinking reputation, the difference cannot be measured. How magnificent is Nie Shicheng.</p>
<p>Do Not Remove the Grass in the Courtyard - A Big Talk Compilation</p>
<h3 id="e153">Dialogue Before the God of War (5) <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>"You say that if war breaks out, China will not necessarily be defeated. What basis do you have for saying that?"</p>
<p>"Japan cannot sustain a long war. Japan's domestic situation is also riddled with problems. Before the invasion of the Three Eastern Provinces, Japan's unemployment rate had already reached 1.5 million. Now, the unemployment rate is around 2.5 million. In Tokyo Prefecture alone, the number of impoverished people who lack adequate food and clothing exceeds 120,000. Thousands of homeless people sleep in the open in the Asakusa area at night. About 40% of university graduates specializing in professional fields cannot find jobs. Farmers nationwide are indebted to the tune of 500 million Japanese yen, which is equivalent to more than 1 billion Chinese dollars. Trade with China has fallen from first place to fifth place, and in the past two months or so, trade worth more than 150 million has been taken over by the United Kingdom and the United States. In this short period, nearly 300 million Japanese yen in cash has flowed to the United States. In the books "Anatomy of the Japanese Zaibatsu by Takahashi Kamekichi" and "The Theory of National Ruin by Joint-Stock Companies," we can see vivid pictures of the corruption and precarious activities of the Japanese financial world. Since the boycott of Japanese goods took effect, countless industrial organizations have collapsed. Due to convenient transportation and developed industries, the organization of the proletarian labor and agricultural classes is even more rigorous, and it has been progressing especially vigorously recently. Secret incitement is often discovered in the military. The Emperor is also not as sacred and inviolable as before. Slogans calling for the overthrow of the Emperor are commonly seen and heard. Japan's old forces are rushing towards collapse at an alarming rate. New forces are lurking everywhere, and they are constantly growing stronger, as if they are saying to the old forces, "He can be replaced by me!" All these circumstances do not allow Japan to sustain a long war. A long war will inevitably lead to the collapse of Japan's old forces. When the old forces are on the verge of collapse, they will not be able to fight again, and they will not dare to fight again."</p>
<p>"Japan is only unfavorable to a long war. What if they defeat our national army in one fell swoop? Wouldn't that be terrible?"</p>
<p>"The emergence of Ma Zhanshan in China has already made Japan unbearable. If war is formally declared, and the whole country is full of Ma Zhanshans, it will inevitably lead to a prolonged war. A long war will lead to the Japanese old forces being overthrown by the new forces without negotiating peace with us."</p>
<p>"After the Japanese old forces are overthrown, East Asia will have one more republic, and China will no longer be lonely."</p>
<p>"Whether Japan will establish a republic after the Japanese old forces are overthrown is still difficult to predict. However, declaring war on Japan will not only uphold justice for China but also provide great assistance to Japan's new forces. This can be asserted."</p>
<p>"If China's declaration of war on Japan helps Japan's new forces, then Japan's new forces should understand China's resistance."</p>
<p>"China's resistance will not only be understood by Japan's new forces, but also applauded and welcomed by all countries in the world that advocate justice and fairness, and they will all stand on our battle line. They are not applauding for us, but for justice and fairness. If we retreat from justice and fairness, then people of ambition all over the world will sigh for us, not sighing for us, but sighing for justice and fairness."</p>
<p>"Judging from this, the future seems quite optimistic."</p>
<p>"You cannot be too optimistic. Based on Chinese history, a Yue Wu Mu will emerge at this time, and there will also be a Qin Hui. At this moment, Yue Wu Mu is fighting against Qin Hui. Whether the Republic of China will become the second Song Dynasty depends on the outcome of the struggle between these two factions."</p>

<p>— Pinxia</p>
<p>Mr. Reggie Sheng is a native of Songjiang. In the past, he also served as a reporter for various famous Chinese-language newspapers in Shanghai. He often associated with Mr. Ma Jingniang, the Deputy Director-General and Acting Director-General of the British Municipal Council, and they discussed current affairs at length. One day, it happened to be a Sunday, and Mr. Ma specially ordered his servant to invite Mr. Sheng to his residence on Jing'an Temple Road for a conversation. Mr. Sheng immediately drove there. Upon arrival, Mr. Ma did not come out immediately. The servant said that the Director-General was currently taking a Japanese language lesson from a Japanese instructor and asked him to wait a moment. After a while, Mr. Ma finished the lesson and came out. Mr. Sheng smiled and asked, "The Director-General already masters six languages, including English, French, German, Russian, Italian, and Chinese. Does he still feel that it is not enough, so he is adding Japanese?" Mr. Ma said, "I have been studying Chinese for a long time, and I find Japanese very easy to learn. However, although Japanese is very easy to learn, the Japanese pronunciation cannot be mastered without being taught by a Japanese person." Mr. Sheng further inquired about how many months he had been studying Japanese on his own. He said, "It has been more than two months. I only spend one hour a day, but I think I have grasped the basics and it is enough to cope with things. As soon as the end of the month comes, I plan to dismiss the Japanese instructor." He also said, "There are many people like Sherlock Holmes among the Japanese. If I let him do this for a long time, I am afraid that many of my public and private secrets will inevitably be detected by him." Mr. Ma said to this point, and then said, "This reminds me of something. During the Boxer Rebellion in the Gengzi year, when the Boxers in Beijing besieged the embassies in the Eastern Legation Quarter, the ambassadors strictly ordered the military officers that no Chinese people outside the boundary were allowed to enter the embassy area. As a result, it was impossible for important figures in the embassies to find a barber. Later, they learned that there was only one Japanese barber in the area, so they reluctantly allowed him to serve them. He often went back and forth among the embassies. Later, when the Eight-Nation Alliance attacked Beijing from Tianjin, people in the embassies saw a person wearing a military uniform with shiny gold-edged epaulets and cap badges, riding a horse under the rising sun. He was the Japanese who had been cutting hair for people in the embassies. It was only then that they realized that the Japanese were doing this lowly job with hidden motives. They not only wanted to probe Chinese military intelligence but also wanted to spy on the secrets of the embassies. That is why I am deeply afraid of the Japanese."</p>

<p>— He Chonglou</p>
<p>The sad news has arrived. Mr. Chen Gangshu, the Heavenly Gang Attendant, has passed away. The vicissitudes of life are deeply painful. Mr. Chen was skilled in calligraphy, painting, poetry, seal carving, and other arts. His works were highly praised by people in society. He was also proficient in Peking opera. I used to be in Shanghai</p>
<h3 id="e157">Zhi Mo's Death (3) <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Haisu</p>
<p>He used such enthusiasm, this fire-like passion, to encourage his friends. After reading this letter, anyone can clearly see the true Xu Zhimo. Because of his character, he became one of China's foremost new poets.</p>
<p>When I returned to China this time, I really wanted to meet Zhi Mo and reminisce about our long separation. Before I left Paris, I received a letter from him, knowing that he also had the same desire. He even wanted to wait for me in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The day after I arrived in Shanghai, at ten o'clock in the morning, I went to Zhi Mo's house on Foch Road. As soon as I entered the door, his servant said to me:</p>
<p>"Mr. Liu, you're back? The young master just went to Beiping yesterday."</p>
<p>I didn't say a word, feeling lost and disappointed. That night, I hastily wrote a letter to him at the Cangzhou Hotel, telling him that I had returned. How will you comfort me?</p>
<p>About six days later, I received a letter from him sent by airmail:</p>
<p>"Hai Su,</p>
<p>I estimate that you will arrive no later than the 15th. I postponed my departure to the 17th. You still haven't sent any news. I thought you must have been delayed in the south. As a result, I left and you arrived. The sorrow of separation for several years has not been expressed. I am extremely disappointed. After arriving here, I sent a letter to Xun Mei to ask if you had arrived, but I didn't receive a reply either. Last night, a letter arrived, which made me happy. Hai Weng's trip must be comparable to Xuanzang's trip to the Western Regions, bringing back many treasures. Living in the country for a long time has made me deaf and blind. I only hope that Hai Weng will return and we can talk freely. I didn't expect to miss each other again. My sister-in-law wants to come back together. What about the young master? The north is still calm. Can you come? Maybe I will want to go down once soon to see your masterpieces."</p>
<p>At that time, I was about to go to Nanjing, so I didn't write back to him. I returned to Shanghai from Nanjing about ten days later. Once, I heard at Zhi Mo's house that he was going to come south. After that, I waited for him every day.</p>
<p>On November 14th, I originally wanted to go to Hangzhou in the afternoon. Just as I was having lunch, Zhi Mo arrived. As he went up the stairs, he exclaimed loudly:</p>
<p>"Hai Su, Hai Tang, how are you? I've come to see your treasures."</p>
<p>I really couldn't describe the shock I felt in my whole body in that magical revelation of happiness. As the saying goes, "It is no regret to have one true friend in life." Zhi Mo was a true friend of mine for life, especially for my paintings.</p>
<p>He walked into the studio and carefully looked at my new works one by one. After looking at about twenty paintings, he sat on the sofa, his cheeks flushed with excitement, and said deeply:</p>
<p>"This is what painting is. It's satisfying to see. Hai Su, your power has reached beyond the canvas. You have established yourself, now you are... not just a Chinese person anymore. It's a pity that China talks about art like this. There are too few talents. But having one is enough..."</p>
<p>After that, he talked a lot about Paris, his face showing satisfaction and hope. He also talked about various things. I was just about to invite him to eat,</p>
<p>to invite him to eat. After eating, he would come back to look at the paintings in detail.</p>
<p>At about three o'clock, he used his naturally silver-like clear voice to shout upstairs, grabbing my hand and making me feel boundless warmth again.</p>
<p>to hold a Yanyihui to raise funds for the Shaanxi disaster relief. Mr. Chen also participated and performed on stage. It can be seen that he was enthusiastic about public welfare and did not only use this art for his own entertainment.</p>
<p>When Mr. Chen was in Shanghai, his residence was not far from mine, so I often visited him in my free time and had long talks. Mr. Chen had grand opinions on all aspects of academics, religion, current affairs, and so on. From this, it can be seen that Mr. Chen was not only proficient in art but also rich in thought.</p>
<p>This spring, when Mr. Chen took his family back to Chenzhou, he left a poem to bid farewell to his relatives and friends. The poem says, "Who is the first to awaken from the great dream? I am the first to wake up from the slumber. To seek a world of joy, I break the dream gourd. I have finished the karma of three lives, a string of Bodhi beads. I offer this cup to bid farewell, will there be another good meeting?" Everyone praised the poem for its transcendence. Who would have thought that it would become a prophecy?</p>
<p>It is said that when Mr. Chen was ill, Mr. Chen's elder brother became ill due to worrying about his younger brother's illness, and he could not recover. Mr. Chen's illness was so severe that his hands and feet were involved, and he also passed away. The two brothers, who went through thick and thin together, were comparable to Boyi and Shuqi on Shouyang Mountain.</p>
<p>Alas, in the midst of national crisis, experienced people are passing away, leaving people with nothing but sighs and uncontrollable grief.</p>

In the November 14th issue of your newspaper, Sun Choucheng's article "A Strange Tale of a Chaste Woman's Unrequited Love and Suicide" was published. After reading it, I am filled with pain. I, Lan, read some books in my childhood. Later, in the fifth year of the Republic of China, I married Zhang Zaifeng of Dongmuchang as my wife. I hoped to grow old together. Unexpectedly, my husband initially caught a cold the following year, but the pain turned into a serious illness. Medication was ineffective, and he passed away forever. Since my late husband's death, I have guarded his spirit tablet. Everyone in the neighborhood knows this. Now, Mr. Sun, without knowing the truth, recklessly submitted an article to the newspaper, claiming that a certain Shao was hired as a long-term worker and that they were having an affair, acting as master and servant by day and husband and wife by night. My family has never hired a long-term worker with the surname Shao. Moreover, my late husband's bones are not yet cold. Even in death, he is alive. How could I engage in indecent behavior? Furthermore, saying that I committed suicide due to unrequited love is even more laughable. I, Lan, am still alive in this world. Alas, Mr. Sun, your writing is profound, but I did not expect you to damage your own character, talk nonsense, and ruin the reputation of others. I would be extremely grateful if you could make a correction. With best wishes, Zhang Wang Lanzhen, November 22nd, from Hangzhou.</p>

<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chapter 1: Yuyang Drumbeat</p>
<p>But what's the use? It's just self-resentment. How can flesh and blood resist ruthless bullets? Where are the national troops stationed there? Why don't we see any movement? As for the residents outside the city, they are even more panicked and have nowhere to go. Stray bullets whiz over the roofs. Life is right in front of us. Anyone's life or death is difficult to determine at this point. Some bold people know that the Sun Country has issued a mobilization order, openly releasing their bestial behavior. But not knowing what they are attacking, they quietly peek from the upper floors. Seeing a red light flashing from the south, followed by the sound of a cannon, hitting the north. Then came the sound of machine guns. It turned out that the people of the Sun Country were attacking our Beida Camp.</p>
<p>Rumble rumble. After the sound of cannons rang continuously, the army of the Sun Country, under the cover of artillery fire, headed towards</p>
<p>But the opposite side was very quiet. There was no return fire. The fierce and cunning Sun army was still afraid of being ambushed</p>
<p>So they kept firing their guns and cannons, creating a terrifying situation. But they were as if they were in no man's land, developing</p>
<p>arrogance and implementing their plans. Originally, the people of the Sun Country in our Northeast regarded our country as no man's land, a forbidden fruit. They had already included it in the palm of their hand to fulfill their ambition to sweep across the three provinces. This time's action, all arrangements were made properly, taking preemptive action, to satisfy their desire for aggression.</p>
<p>Alas. This is a very strange question. When two countries fight each other, with flags and drums, there are certain steps to follow. There is no such thing as starting a war without warning, secretly and stealthily. Isn't this similar to the behavior of bandits? Although there are strategies in the art of war to attack the unprepared by surprise, it is ultimately after both sides declare war, each using surprise troops to determine the outcome. There is no way that civilized countries would engage in such bandit-like behavior. But the nature of the people of the Sun Country is like this. They like to take advantage of this to kill people quickly, catching them off guard and releasing their tactics. What hatred have the people of the Sun Country and us formed? In theory, we are of the same race and culture, and we are also on the same continent. We should work together to seek the happiness of the people of both countries.</p>

<h3 id="e163">Securities and Bond Prices Plunge Together <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Market Sentiment Weakens Due to Current Situation</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange, the spot prices of all bonds, except for the 1929 National Loan at 96, opened sluggishly and trading remained quiet. In the futures market, prices also fell sharply. The January contract remained inactive, while the December contract saw slightly more trading than the previous day, with activity seen on both sides. However, the market trend indicated that selling was far more active than buying, causing bond prices to fall sharply due to oversupply. This was due to the government's decision not to agree to the neutral zone issue in accordance with public opinion, and the Japanese continued their unreasonable and barbaric conspiracies, leaving the future of diplomacy very bleak. Furthermore, the issue of peaceful reunification with Guangdong had not been fully resolved, causing renewed public unease and a surge in selling activity. However, investor confidence remained weak, and they remained on the sidelines. At the initial opening, prices fell sharply across the board, with further declines in subsequent trading. Later, the supply and demand gradually balanced, and prices fluctuated without significant changes. As a result, compared to the previous day, the 1919 Customs Bonds, 20th Year Consolidated Bonds (futures), and Troop Reduction Bonds (spot) all fell by three yuan. Other bonds fell by two to two and a half yuan. Only the Entire Sixth Salt Tax futures fell by about one yuan, and the 1926 Loan fell by only 75 cents. The future of the bond market remains as uncertain as before. It is estimated that the total futures trading volume was 6,395,000 yuan, with 4,550,000 yuan in the morning session and over 1,800,000 yuan in the afternoon session. The total spot trading volume was 48,000 yuan.</p>

<p>The yarn market is weak due to unfavorable news and tight credit conditions, leading to a lack of confidence. Those taking profits seize the opportunity to close positions, further weakening the market. Actual sales are particularly sluggish, and all traders lack active sentiment. The overall trend remains in a state of fluctuation.</p>
<p>Subject to Rumors, the Man Brand Yarn Market Opens Softly</p>
<p>The Man Brand Yarn market opened with a soft tone due to weak U.S. cotton prices. Prices for all months fell by 2, 4, 6, and 8 cents. In the afternoon, due to unfavorable rumors about national affairs, near-term contracts fell by 1 tael and 1 cent, and far-term contracts fell by 2 cents. The total trading volume for the day was 13,700 bales. Sales exceeded purchases by 1,800 bales, with Changji selling 1,600 bales and Changfeng selling 600 bales. Purchases were made by Dachangcheng (1,100 bales), Warui Da (600 bales), Xinchang (800 bales), and Tongyu (750 bales). The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>The cotton market is flat and weak due to increasing private estimates of U.S. cotton yields, leading to softening sentiment. Gold prices are also weak, dragging down the market. However, Indian cotton prices are very high, and shipments from various regions remain scarce. Flower shops in rural areas report that sales are stagnant and credit conditions are tightening, leading to temporary closures and suspension of operations. Therefore, there is no prospect of vigorous sources of supply. However, the overall situation is very weak.</p>
<p>Hang Brand Yarn Market Declines</p>
<p>The Hang Brand Yarn market opened with a soft tone due to rising U.S. and Indian cotton prices. Prices for all months fell by 5 fen to 1.5 cents.

<p>A New York telegram from the 4th reports on the cotton market over the past week: The cotton market was very quiet last week, with very narrow fluctuations. Cooperatives sold slightly during market rallies, and hedging in the South was very thin. There were also no signs of a loosening of hoarding activities. When prices fell, short covering and inter-dealer buying occurred. The overall trend seemed to be awaiting the government's estimate report or stabilization of the securities market. Bullish sentiment was largely based on the fact that prices were too low. However, the current situation still lacks certainty because the visible supply is too large and all industries show no signs of recovery. Although the Department of Agriculture opposed the export bonds or farmland relief fees advocated by agricultural leaders in the Senate Agriculture Committee, they may become law. Therefore, the final success or failure of this matter is still uncertain, resulting in a calm and unstable cotton market last week.</p>

<h3 id="e171">River Rice Market in Shanghai Falls by Half a Yuan <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the supply from the countryside was still abundant, with over 50 dealers. Outbound sales in the city were extremely weak, and the situation collapsed. Chinese rice fell by half a yuan, and public sentiment stabilized. Merchants from the southern port purchased 500 shih of early and late rice. The local market had no appetite at all, so prices were uniformly lower by 2 jiao. Doyangjian rice arrivals were selling at a flat price, with no change. Transactions were sluggish. Breweries showed little interest, and prices were down by a few cents.</p>
<p>Around the Suzhou Creek in Xinzha, there were about 40 or 50 suppliers, but sales were stagnant. Xixin's medium-grade coarse rice was the most abundant, and prices fell by about 2 jiao. Shipments of thin rice from Shipu, Chonggu, Songjiang, etc. were also down by 2 or 3 jiao. Shipments of coarse rice and foreign rice were scarce, and the situation was stable. Although the arrival of glutinous rice was limited, demand was even weaker, and the overall price fell by a few cents.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Continued Transactions in Spot Foreign Rice <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>The rice market situation remained undeveloped yesterday, and the futures rice market seemed to be gradually sinking. However, there were still slight accommodations on the spot market from local merchants, and market prices remained flat. Although foreign firms showed intention to sell futures, there were no buyers interested, so there were no transactions in the overall market. Trading was also slow. Only the April contract for No. 1 Saigon rice traded 200 tons at a price of 5 taels. The Yinghua Company unloaded and offered a total of over 1,000 bags of No. 1 Saigon spot rice at a price of 11 yuan, 2 jiao, 3 fen to 11 yuan, 1 jiao, 5 fen. Taizhou's newly arrived rice was offered at 250 bags at a price of 10 yuan and 2 jiao, all of which were purchased by local merchants.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Sluggish Sales Lead to Weaker Wheat Flour Market <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat flour market trended weak. Although the quotations for foreign wheat only slightly declined, actual sales were sluggish. Large flour mills were already willing to lower prices below standard, and small and medium-sized mills naturally faced inventory accumulation. Therefore, public confidence in the current month weakened further. The opening price in the afternoon was 1 tael, 8 jiao, 7 fen, which was 2 and a half fen lower than the closing price of the previous day. Subsequently, buying from Tianjin traders slightly boosted sentiment, but the January contract was still being hedged. In this situation, there is no prospect of a good future. As a result, the current month was down by another 7 and a half li compared to the previous day, January was down 3 fen, February was down 1 fen, 2 li, 5 hao, March and April were down 1 fen, May was down 1 fen, 2 li, 5 hao.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Distant Wheat Market Extremely Weak <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market showed a trend of near-term stability and distant-term weakness. In the current month, due to few sellers, a small number of millers slightly increased their purchases, causing the market sentiment to fluctuate. Distant-term months were reportedly contracted to be supplied with foreign wheat by mills from the western part of Hanzhou at a mere 3 taels, 8 jiao, 6 fen. With such a low price, distant-term wheat naturally could not stabilize, leading to a gradual decline and extreme weakness. As a result, the current month was up by 1 fen compared to the previous day, January was down 3 fen, February was flat, March was down 4 fen, and April was down 3 fen.</p>
<p>The Miscellaneous Grains Exchange has scheduled the opening of trading for December to begin on the 20th, and trading for distant-term months to continue until the 25th. The market will open on January 5th next year, as has been publicly announced.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Silk and Tea Factories Experience Continued Sluggish Sales <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market in Shanghai continued to be sluggish. White and yellow filature silk sales to Lyon remained stagnant. There were no transfers from New York. Stockpilers continued to try to suppress prices, and negotiations were proceeding. Of the 350 bales of white and yellow filature silk for which an agreement had been reached, there were still issues with the Chinese merchants, and only 40% of those contracts were actually signed and registered the day before yesterday. Yesterday, only Xinfu and others purchased 20 bales of yellow filature silk, and Xinshichang purchased 10 bales of dry white filature silk. Prices remained flat and weak.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Yellow and White Raw Silk Exports Increasingly Rare <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>The CCP only exported over 900 bales last month. European and American demand for dry white silk is insufficient. Last month (i.e., November), the CCP only shipped 111 bales to the United States, Britain, and France. Due to India's increased import duties, exports of coarse yellow silk from Sichuan, Shandong, and Hubei have also decreased. A total of only 793 bales were shipped out in November.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Foreign Tea Market Increasingly Quiet <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign tea market in Shanghai continued to be quiet. This was because British and French firms had exhausted their inventories of green tea from Tunxi, Shexian, and other areas. The only remaining tea on the market was the Wubei Zhenjie, which amounted to only 3,000 to 4,000 boxes. With current European sales underway, transactions were scarce. However, according to tea merchants, it should not be difficult to sell off all green tea inventories within the year.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Coal: Sales of Zhongmei Anthracite Slack <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>The Zhongxing brand of anthracite coal dust from Shandong province is one of the best domestic coals. It is used by various Chinese warships and railways. However, because of its high value, it is rarely used by factories and households. Recently, since the Wan'an Incident, factories have gradually purchased it, resulting in active sales. The price has gradually increased to over 15 taels per ton. Unexpectedly, due to the recent closure of various silk factories in both local and foreign areas, the outlet of various coal dusts has stagnated, and the sale of Zhongxing coal has also become sluggish. The selling price has also weakened. Yesterday, the market offered to sell it at 14 taels and a half per ton.</p>

<p>The Far East Longhua Lee Company, located at 46 Hankou Road, announces that the company is the manager of the famous French factory's fat, white, red-blooded beauty skin tablets, which supplement blood and nourish the skin. They are an essential product for European ladies to strengthen their bodies and beautify their skin. They were once shipped to Shanghai and sold out quickly. Now, another batch has arrived, which is still limited. Therefore, they will not be distributed to other cities for the time being. In Shanghai, the exclusive agent is Meili, located at 306 Nanjing Road, in the middle section of the British Concession. Detailed Chinese instructions are available upon request.</p>
