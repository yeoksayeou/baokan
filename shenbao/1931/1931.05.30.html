<p>昨日美電稱美奥商約調印後美與德奥均互以最惠國相待遇此後美對德奥關稅同盟之態度頗堪研究蓋如依據最惠國待遇之規定美所輸往者竟不得同等利益則美將反對此項同盟是前所傳美已同意於德奥稅約之說尙未足恃也</p>
<p>今日法電稱白里安在衆院辨論外交事件時聲言德奥同盟之輪軸已被制止法意關係現有趨向完全妥協之勢是前所傳德奥稅約並不因提付海牙法庭而暫停進行及意國暗助德奥以反法等說亦尙未足信也</p>
<p>柏林電稱英政府對德國賠欵問題顯有討論之可能下星期英德要人相會於吉可爾斯時德若提出此問題英政府當不至拒絶然法國輿論則已加以駁斥謂德國倘敢將賠欵問題私自與英國接洽實屬違法之舉而英報對此說又加抨擊是前所傳英法對德賠欵問題取一致態度之說猶非眞相也德奥稅約與德賠欵兩事爲有關歐洲全局問題而亦爲牽涉最多之問題故各國應付此兩問題之態度如何實爲世人所最注意者蓋其離合變化之間即足以逆知前途之成敗也</p>

<p>藝術界關於新傾向底技巧  林倭衛著　陳抱一譯　　即講到新傾向但這里並非就那種莫名其妙的新的東西而說也不是要說得怎麽廣的意味只不過欲簡單地提起四五作家而就其特殊的技法誌述一點兒雜感罷了然而也因述者即非有着明確的見解而說的恐怕將會講出很瞹昧的東西來故預先向閱者諸君聲明一句　　却說繪畫上之重視技巧乃當然之事但比較起古代而看則今日於技巧上也有許多的變遷而變成了很複雜的東西「技巧」一種意味之解釋也自然而殊異起來了自從十九世紀後半特見呈示出劃然的變化竟打破了從來的僅認技巧爲繪畫構成上一大要素的看法而且浸潤到表示作家的個性之境域上面來了印象派畫家的技巧便能使人判然感到這事譬如便是莫納（Monet）便是辟薩羅（Pissao）其技法都是各自獨特的東西是以自己的自然觀爲對象必然的地産生出來的東西技巧的單是終於技巧而却變做了一種薰染着作者底潑刺的生活氣息的東西了塞尙（Cezanne）自不用說我以爲即就谷訶（Van　Gogh）而看或在不同的方面就羅脫萊克（Loutrec）須臘（Serual）等而看也可以充分地窺得此間之消息　　言歸本題若看到所謂現代新傾向的畫　則作爲最有特異的複雜性底技巧家而惹人注目者要算辟卡梭（Picasso）吧辟卡梭底藝術底本質我雖不能充分地了解但在他的異常的才能之閃爍和變轉無極的表現方法上却見有可驚異的東西單就我所親見的而講他的作品上也顯然有過五六回劃期變易他的初期之作我以爲是可屬於後期印象派之部類的但是在變了立體派的時候他的技法頓然現出顯着的變化來了因爲立體派這東西的形式旣是以多份意識的技巧爲必要者故亦可見得像他那樣的先天的發明的技巧者却能一任其才能而開拓了驅使奔放自在的技法之道　　五六年前的辟瞳梭曾脫出了立體派而急轉直下地復歸於古希臘試圖古典的原始性之表出但又卒然捨之而突如地把一種以纖麗的線描爲主的淡彩寗說是東洋風的作品來發表竟使觀者爲之愕然可是看那據說是今年（一九二六年）的作品則又見逆轉回去却又是屬於純粹的立體派的東西了那種目眩的變轉倒使我吃了一驚　　我覺得辟卡梭底技法之特徵乃在不澁滯的線描之整然和色彩之單純化所融合而成的清純的色調裏在畫面全體依明確的意識所構成着之處有新傾向的技巧所具的强味便看到安特萊羅脫（Anere　Lhote）的技巧亦見遠弱於前者的其畫品雖未可同日而論然在技巧之意識的强調上則有着某種共通點逗斐（Dafy）或比西愛爾（Bissiere）雖則稍異其趣但於各人自由地驅使筆觸色彩之處皆有特性　　稅岡澤克（Segonzac）底技法雖則全然與前述之作家廻異然而我覺得他底技法正是循踏着傳統而來的這雖然不是特由他所起始但却是由他底深切的「自然觀照」而把握到的極健實的東西也又是具着現代的一大特性底東西　　上面講的適如引言所述見與本題相離頗覺未能盡意那末就此擱筆了給比國朗誦家Liten一封公開的信  廖靑主　　我所敬愛的Liten先生　　我自從上禮拜一晚在國立音樂專科學校裏面聽過你的朗誦藝術之後我覺得有寫這一封信給你的必要而且是一封公開的信我要把它譯成中文在國内發表出去俾我的一般邦人亦可以知道它的内容　　我因爲向來很醉心說話的藝術尤其是因爲我從前在德國公開演講的時候被該處的新聞記者批評我的口音不好所以我才下了學習朗誦的决心我的先生一個很著名的演劇女藝人要我從ABC學起我自己亦不曉得做過多少苦工夫才得到我的先生的滿足所以我這裏要先拿來對你說我很知道朗誦是怎麽樣的一種藝術　　說話是理性的表現這是誰都知道的人之所以異於禽獸亦是因爲他會說話的緣故這就是說因爲他會把他的理性表現出來的緣故當我那時開首大略曉得朗誦的時候我眞是不勝歡喜我見得我從那時起才成爲一個完全的人被人呌做萬物之靈的人不是很應該把他的說話經過一番的藝術化麽　　我自回到東方以來已經是八年有多了在此八年有多的長期間當中我從未曾得到聽别人朗誦的機會遇着我向我的邦人說起朗誦的藝術又或我自己朗誦給他們聽他們總不大相信這是最高雅的藝術我用是太息我用是失望　　Liten先生你是一個朗誦的藝人你知道最清楚凡屬藝人尤其是朗誦的藝人都要得到外間的一些承認一個朗誦的藝人竟不能夠得到羣衆的了解僅能夠朗誦給自己聽這樣一種不幸的遭遇怎能夠不令人失望呢　　關於我自己的話我已經說了不少但是「如果我說起我自己來亦無非是從那個問題着想」這句話我或者可以引用來說當我那一天得到那個消息說你會到來國立音樂專科學校裏面朗誦我的歡喜眞是莫可形容到了那天晚上——吁那是怎麽樣的一個晚上你看那一般在座的人們拍掌拍得這樣熱烈你便可以想見他們的歡喜了但是内中由你的朗誦醖釀出來的最大的歡喜——你可以相信我那是我的歡喜我的邦人從此總可以知道朗誦是怎麽樣的一回事了他們從此亦總不會看輕這種藝術了如果我後來同他們說起這種藝術他們亦總會較爲願意聽了——　　我的法國話是很不高明的所以我要老實對你說你那天晚上拿來朗誦的法文詩我是不知道它的内容但是我何嘗不知道它的内容關於那些祇分别輕重說出來的字音我這裏用不着說起因爲詑不過是要使别人知道我們的思想換句話說知道我們的精神動作的一種符號而且同一個思想在各種說話之中亦可以用各種的字音把它表現出來如果換在那些染色的字音那便不同說法了染色的字音不僅是間接的符號而且亦是直接的精神動作的表現我要拿來說的就是這種染色的字音不論是中國話抑或是法國話那些用來表現我們的精神動作的音色總是一樣的因此之故我能夠由你說話的音色雖然你所說的話是我所不大懂的法國話我亦知道你在那一個時候嗟嘆在那一個時候歡呼無論你是請求抑或命令又或普通的叙述我都知道很清楚　　在很短的一個晚上我竟能夠身歷這許多的生活情態呈這就是說話的藝術的法力我看見你像秋天一般的晴朗像春風一般的愉快從你的笑口吐出一片如火如荼的熱情我看見你赫然震怒又好像面有憂色忽而痛苦忽而恐懼中間又愁嘆悲鳴我看見你不勝怨恨盡情嘲笑心比秋蓮之苦徒喚奈何又若惟我獨尊目無餘子有時你又做出一個中了一枝愛哥的情態這樣懇切這樣温柔我恍惚看見一個輕力短褲少年向着一個妙齡女子曲盡殷勤我怎樣看得出來無非是從你那種活潑不過的極抑揚頓挫之妙的說話審聽得來簡單的說一句從你的情感的音色察看出來你的情感的音色忽又亦在成意志的音色當我看見你若有所請求若有所威脅當你後來用平坦的話音和平的語勢朗誦那些雨雪的詩的時候我的像聽見debussy　ravel　scrjabine的音樂作品又好像看見monet　pizzarro　cezanne的印象名畫這不是你的認識的音的法力是什麽遇着你的話音低下去我便知道你的思想暫告一段落遇着你的話音高起來我便知道你的思想漸到了最高點遇着你說出一片沉細的話音我便知道你的思想旣到了陰暗的千鈞一髮的險境我說我的法國話雖不高明但是你所朗誦的詩和戲劇我都得到會心這是半點虚僞都没有的　　我這裏要想起goetbe的faust裏面的一段話　　Helena告訴我罷我怎能夠也說得這樣好聽　　Faust這是易事祗要從心裏說出來　　我所敬愛的Liten先生你的朗誦是由心裏說到心裏去的　　最近數年來西方的音的藝術開始流入我的祖國我雖淺陋亦願有以闡發音的藝術的神秘我們都很知道没有正確的說話的藝術詩的藝術和歌樂的藝術是没有希望的祗有　得朗誦的詩人才是一個完全的詩人祗有懂得朗誦的作曲家才能夠做出很好的樂歌若是我的邦人自聽過你的朗誦之後開首明白創作音的藝術是需要怎麽樣的根本條件在我的一般邦人之中我是頭一個要向你表示最誠懇的感謝　　在這種意義之中我向你頭一個使我的邦人明白說話的藝術的朗誦藝人表示最誠懇的敬禮我是　　最佩服你的靑主</p>

<p>Central Standing Committee</p>
<h3 id="e3">Held a Provisional Meeting This Morning <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing Central Government has scheduled a provisional standing committee meeting for the morning of the 30th to discuss the current situation. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e4">Wu Zhihui Answers Questions from Guests <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Reflections on the Guangdong Incident</p>
<p>The Central Government is Determined Not to Issue a Declaration of War Lightly</p>
<p>Nanjing: Wu Zhihui, answering questions from guests, stated that after the National Assembly, the Central Government intends to implement the Provisional Constitution and should first accomplish two things: (1) Launch a large-scale suppression of the Red bandits, eradicating the Communist bandits in Jiangxi and Hubei within a short period. (2) Urge local governments to eliminate bandits in various regions. The Guangdong faction intends to assist the bandits and Red elements, hindering the government's progress and making it impossible to proceed. Naturally, grievances arise. However, the current assembly in Guangdong, aside from the reorganization faction and others, consists of those who previously encouraged the government to suppress the rebels. The result was repeated deception. Those who encouraged the suppression of rebels turned to rebellion in an instant. I believe the Central Government will not easily issue another declaration of war and be deceived again. For now, we can let them be for a while. Perhaps their conscience will awaken during this time of bandit suppression, or the people will gradually disband and repent. Therefore, while peace cannot be guaranteed, war is not certain either. Hearing that Chen and Sun are traveling together, and that Wang, Gu, Li, Xu, Chen, and Bai may all be at the same meeting, a large pile of garbage may accumulate after an expanded meeting. What they sent are two telegrams, one from Tang Shaoyi and 21 others, and one from Sun Ke. These 22 individuals are divided into roughly six factions: First, the transcendent faction, namely Tang Shaoyi, Wang Chonghui, Lin Sen, and Li Liejun. Tang, as an observer, is often confused. Back in the 13th year of the Republic, he criticized Sun Zhesheng's father, Wang Chonghui, for attending the International Court of Justice. Yesterday, he spoke with Li Shizeng and expressed his unwillingness to be involved. The names of Mr. Lin and Mr. Li may have also been added. Second, the right-wing of the Kuomintang, including Gu and Chen, is further divided into two categories. Category A includes Deng Zhiru, Xiao Focheng, Chen Yaoyuan, and Deng Qingyang. They listen to one side of the story or pre-conceived notions, using injustice as a pretext and allowing their names to be listed. Category B includes Gu Yingfen, Chen Jitang, Chen Ce, Ma Chaojun, Li Wenfan, Liu Jiwen, and Lin Yinhai, who are the central figures in initiating the incident. Third, the Western Hills faction, namely Sun Ke, Xu Chongzhi, and Zou Lu. Xu and Zou ran to the expanded meeting, which originally differed from Sun's intentions. Sun is one to jump at the slightest provocation. Some, like Chen Youren, know that if they don't involve him, the factions won't come together, so they pushed him into the fire. Zou and Xu are precisely looking to vent their pent-up anger. Fourth, Li Zongren is the mortal enemy of Gu and Chen. Fifth, the reorganization faction, namely Wang Zhaoming and Tang Shengzhi. When their time comes, they will vent their anger for their failure in Beiping. Sixth, the Third Party of the Kuomintang, namely the handsome Chen Youren. He, along with Tan Pingshan and Deng Yanda, formed a party and may have a mission to the Third International. The cause of this dispute lies in their initial telegram, which stated, "Since the National Revolutionary Army completed the Northern Expedition and unified China, there was indeed an opportunity to implement our party's principles to benefit the country and the people. However, the officials have ruined everything, leading to popular disappointment and resentment reaching their peak. Comrades could no longer tolerate it and rose up to resist the officials. Counting the years, all domestic wars since the 18th year of the Republic have been caused by one official." Such words seem too simplistic. Please consider that the first war was to suppress the Gui faction. Now, Gu and Chen can sit and talk with Li and Bai, being comrades who could no longer tolerate it and rose up to resist the officials. Why would Gu and Chen assist the officials in resisting the comrades who could no longer tolerate it? You and others safeguard the authority of the Central Government and enforce discipline, which is righteous. However, as circumstances change, what Gu once considered righteousness is now considered the crime of one official, which is quite absurd. Therefore, on May 8th, Sun had already agreed to go to Beijing. Ma Chaojun went to Zhang's residence and said that Sun's wife feared something unfavorable would happen to Sun in Beijing. Zhang Jingjiang said that they could guarantee it. Ma jokingly said, "You have already lost credibility with Ren Chao, so it may be difficult to gain my trust." I angrily said, "If these words come from Mr. Ma, can you guarantee Mr. Gu as you guarantee us?" Premier Sun advocated equal rights and romanticized the hope of separation and cooperation. Those who strictly adhere to democratic centralism strive hard, and many comrades become strict. Therefore, they often feel apologetic for not being able to achieve centralization, as it seems to hinder unification. Revolution is definitely not for wealth and status but for principle. Otherwise, one would rebel at the first sign of frustration.</p>

<p>If one is not welcome here, there are places where one will be welcomed. Resentment is equivalent to treating people as animals. Our group today is an absolutely anti-Red group. Former enemies are now friends. This extended meeting is mocked at home and abroad. Today, the six groups in Guangzhou are incongruous and gathering together, which is a stain on humanity. For example, Deng Zhiru and Wang Zhaoming sit side by side, Gu Yingfen and Li Zongren share a table, Chen Jitang and Bai Chongxi shake hands, Tang Shaoyi and Chen Youren take off their hats. Can one's skin not crawl? The reason for the current situation in Guangzhou is whether Bo Nan is driving away Zhen Ru to seize power, then today those who condemn officials for occupying a country themselves want to occupy a part. Are they driving away for profit, then suspicious of handling the country's wealth as personal property, they themselves privately benefit from the wealth of a province. Mr. Hu's problem is that political views differ, but daily all originate from C and D colluding to reverberate. Then the feeling that A and B do not understand each other must be revealed, at least there must be passive action. Once a misunderstanding occurs, if someone is still like today, they must use their name to carry out the plot of driving away, adding the name of detention if they stay, adding the crime of expulsion if they leave, using it as an excuse, is it different? I'm afraid it's no different. Since both sides are guilty, naturally there is nothing to say. Mr. Hu's blood pressure is still high, so he is scheduled to travel. Originally, he was not fit to travel. As for future actions, he can decide for himself. If Mr. Hu goes to Guangzhou to be dragged into a garbage dump and negotiate with Wang, it is not what Hu would like. Because Hu is the leader of the anti-Red group, he cannot compromise on political views with Wang, the leader of the quasi-Red group. Even because someone detained Mr. Hu, please ask, has he not left Nanjing for four years, only occasionally recuperating in politics, and the central affairs still await him to preside over. Others call it detention and will make him avoid going, if they will make him accompany others to the icy land of Moscow. Those who were comically called exiled officials were biased enough for Hu and Wang to cooperate, wouldn't Mr. Hu laugh upon hearing it? If you want to use Mr. Hu's problem to incite war, what is the sincerity of rescuing Mr. Hu? I think Ze Ru will be the first to say, "We were greatly deceived when you brought in Mr. Wang. You are not sincere to Hu." Fortunately, I am prepared to taste the flavor of being skinned by the Communist Party and not afraid of massacres. Anyway, Mr. Sun's telegram deeply fears the communist disaster. Sun must have a final strategy to quell the chaos, which we can take. Mr. Sun's implementation of industrial plans is like a good son. As for dealing with the party and the country, he is used and has a young master's temper, saying all kinds of nonsensical things. When he was in Hankou, he expressed that the National Assembly was unnecessary, or people are doing it for him. Therefore, that branch of a tree going back to Guangzhou, those famous words are not equivalent, so let that branch of a tree compact it for now. How this matter will turn out depends on development, but our friends are acting on emotion and casually allowing others to be exiled. They also come to cry crocodile tears, and the last act may be a victory for the pro-Communist group, a great union of pro-Red groups, and the Third International laughing. We have to muster our spirits and think of a way, not watch the fire from the other side as if it is none of our business. Do you think our spirit of suppressing the Reds is not enough? These unbelievable friends in Guangzhou are still dividing our spirit. We only have to muster our spirits to first eradicate the Red bandits in Jiangxi and Hubei, making them completely gone. Otherwise, if they help the Red bandits come to disturb, we will treat them the same as Red bandits. (29th)</p>

<p>Nanjing: The British and American envoys have decided to disregard the notification from the thirteen members of Guangdong on the basis of diplomatic practice.

However, they said that the combination of the old diplomat Tang Shaoyi and the new diplomat Chen Youren is a very interesting issue. (29th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e16">Trade Treaty and Indemnity <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, a telegram from the United States stated that after the signing of the US-Austrian trade treaty, the United States and Germany and Austria mutually treat each other as most-favored nations. Therefore, the attitude of the United States towards the German-Austrian customs union is quite worthy of study. If, according to the provisions of most-favored-nation treatment, the goods exported by the United States do not receive equal benefits, then the United States will oppose this union. Therefore, the previous rumors that the United States had agreed to the German-Austrian trade treaty are not yet reliable.</p>
<p>Today, a telegram from France stated that Briand, during a debate on diplomatic events in the Chamber of Deputies, declared that the wheels of the German-Austrian alliance have been stopped, and the relationship between France and Italy is now trending towards complete compromise. Therefore, the previous rumors that the German-Austrian trade treaty will not be suspended due to being submitted to the Hague Tribunal, and that Italy is secretly assisting Germany and Austria to oppose France, are also not yet reliable.</p>
<p>A telegram from Berlin stated that the British government is showing the possibility of discussing the German indemnity issue. When British and German dignitaries meet at Chequers next week, if Germany raises this issue, the British government will not refuse. However, French public opinion has already rejected it, saying that if Germany dares to privately contact Britain on the indemnity issue, it is an illegal act. British newspapers have criticized this statement. Therefore, the previous rumors that Britain and France have taken a consistent attitude towards the German indemnity issue are still not the truth. The German-Austrian trade treaty and the German indemnity issue are both issues related to the overall European situation and are also the most complex issues. Therefore, the attitude of various countries in dealing with these two issues is what the world is most concerned about. The changes in their cooperation and division are enough to predict the success or failure of the future.</p>

<p>Beiping: Yang Shaoye and Zou Quansun, representatives of the Beiping Chamber of Commerce, and Chen Chuxiang and Bao Zhusan, representatives of the Tianjin Chamber of Commerce, visited Jing Youyan at 3:00 PM today, requesting the abolition of the production and sales tax and the release of seized goods. Jing Youyan replied that if the production and sales tax is to be completely abolished, he must request instructions from Deputy Commander Zhang before it can be implemented. For the time being, only temporary deferral of collection is possible. As for the seized goods, he will immediately order the various tax bureaus to release them tomorrow. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin: The Tianjin Chamber of Commerce and various industry associations opposed the production and sales tax and sent representative Wang Wendian to Beiping to visit Zhang and appeal for its abolition. Zhang did not see him, and he returned to Tianjin on the 28th. On the afternoon of the 29th, he, together with Zhang Pintao, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, visited Wang Shuchang at the provincial government. Zhang said that the merchants were celebrating the easing of the situation after the streamlining of customs duties, but now the implementation of the production and sales tax, with one item taxed three times, is even heavier than the likin tax. Since there is no clear order from the National Government and it has not been decided by the provincial government, if it is not abolished, all merchants will close down. Wang agreed to go to Beiping that evening to report the merchants' difficulties to Deputy Commander Zhang for review. The Chamber of Commerce convened a meeting of representatives from various industries on the afternoon of the 28th, and the sentiment was intense. It was decided that Wang Wen, Huang Jin, and Zhang Pintao would go to Beiping on the 30th to appeal separately. (29th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Are Being Drafted in the Legislative Yuan</p>
<p>Nanjing: The Finance and Economic Committees of the Legislative Yuan have jointly drafted the regulations for the issuance of 80 million yuan in unified tax treasury bonds and can submit them for review within a week to be passed by the Yuan. The tobacco tax accounts for the majority of this unified tax, with a monthly income of approximately 5 million yuan. The four items of cotton yarn, cement, matches, and wheat flour account for approximately 1 million yuan. Using this as collateral for the treasury bonds is more than sufficient. Only one-tenth of it needs to be extracted each year to cover the needs for repaying the principal and interest. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing: The regulations on the unified tax public bonds and the principal and interest repayment schedule have been submitted by the Ministry of Finance to the National Government to be reviewed by the Legislative Yuan. The fixed weekly interest rate is 8%, and the principal and interest will be fully repaid in one hundred months from the date of issuance. The Ministry of Finance originally planned to issue them on June 1st, but because the procedures still need to be negotiated, it will be postponed to July 1st. (29th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Ascending to 16,000 Meters</p>
<p>Graduation with Safe Landing on Glacier</p>
<p>Obtaining Important Scientific Data</p>
<p>Instruments Undamaged, Balloon Intact</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 28th - According to news from Vienna, Professor Picard and Dr. Kipfert, who ascended by balloon, landed safely on the Gugger Glacier near Millano last night. They ascended to a height of 16,000 meters, safe and sound, and their scientific instruments were not damaged.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>The two have now arrived in the town of Gugger. It is said that the flight was excellent and they have obtained very important scientific data. They spent the night in the balloon basket and walked to the valley after dawn.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 28th - Professor Picard and others told Reuters that the only discomfort they felt in the air was the lack of drinking water, and they did not feel in danger. The temperature in the basket was 40 degrees Celsius. In the upper atmosphere, the outside temperature was 55 degrees Celsius below freezing. They deliberately stayed in the air at night in order to land on the mountain in the dark, but a storm was approaching and the balloon was gradually losing its ascent power, so they had to land on the glacier. All of their equipment was undamaged and the balloon was intact. Soldiers are currently dismantling it.</p>
<p>Reuters, Brussels, 28th - Professor Picard called his wife from Albegogger to reassure her that the balloon had risen to a height of about 18,000 meters above the ground and only began to descend at sunset. The door of the basket, which could allow one person to enter and exit, was only opened ten minutes before the balloon landed on the glacier. The oxygen supply equipment was satisfactory throughout.</p>
<p>Reuters, Brussels, 28th - The Belgian King has awarded decorations to Professor Picard and Dr. Kipfert.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Guerchier, 28th - Professor Picard and aeronautical engineer Dr. Kipfert, after experiencing various strange experiences in the unexplored atmosphere by ascending in a balloon, told the American News Agency reporter today about their journey: They departed at 3:57 AM on Wednesday and ascended to over 16,000 meters (over ten miles). They landed on the Gürlai Glacier at 11:00 PM at night and stayed on the ice. The aluminum chamber they were in was undamaged, and all instruments and charts were intact. Many of the most valuable records were obtained when the balloon rose, which can provide scientists with years of research and will change some meteorological theories. They were very pleased to have been able to rise to such a height. Although they suffered various pains, the rewards were far beyond expectations. The balloon was always under control during the journey, flying from Augsburg to Gürchier at an average altitude of about 10,000 meters. In the upper atmosphere, the outside air temperature was between 50 and 60 degrees Celsius below zero, but the temperature in the aluminum chamber was often 41 degrees Celsius due to direct sunlight. The upper part of the aluminum chamber was so hot from the sunlight that it burned the hand. They tested the cosmic ray theory of relativity inventor Einstein. The results are sufficient to dispel all doubts in the scientific community about this theory. They originally planned to descend at the originally scheduled time, but the sunlight was too hot during the day, making it impossible for the gas in the balloon to escape, so they waited until night to land. Today, Mr. Picard called the factory in Augsburg that manufactured the balloon, saying that he may make another ascent, but he must wait until he returns to Brussels to make a list of the records he has obtained before he can determine. It is said that Mr. Picard will stay here for three days to supervise the packaging of all instruments and documents to be transported back to Brussels.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Innsbruck, 29th - This morning, news reporters from various countries gathered like locusts in the remote mountain village of Guerchier, wanting to meet Professor Picard, but Mr. Picard was fast asleep resting. Engineer Kipfert led soldiers and workers to the glacier in the early morning to dismantle the balloon and transport back the instruments. It is said that the balloon will still be transported to Augsburg because Professor Picard will soon make a second ascent. According to Mr. Picard last night, the balloon was always easy to drive, only the opening mechanism was blocked and unresponsive, so he could not descend during the day as scheduled. When he flew to the upper atmosphere, it was about 7:30 in the morning, and he stayed until the evening before he could descend. At that time, the oxygen stored in the aluminum chamber was only enough for two hours, so he hurriedly landed. He had enough food, but too little drink, because he did not expect that the aluminum chamber would be as hot as 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit). In the end, he could only lick the dew condensed on the wall of the chamber to soothe his parched throat. It can be said that it is a strange thing in the world that the outdoor air is colder than the Arctic, but the indoor air is so hot. At an altitude of 15,000 to 16,000 meters, the atmospheric pressure was measured to be 76 degrees (the original text is like this, I am afraid there is an error).</p>

<h3 id="e72">New Configuration of the Northeast River Defense Ships <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Damaged Ships Lijie and Jiangping are Docked</p>
<p>Sunken Ship Jiangheng is Now Being Salvaged</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: After the Sino-Russian War, more than half of the Northeast River Defense warships were damaged and sunk. Last year, Navy Commander Shen Honglie submitted a budget of 400,000 to the Northeast authorities for approval to restore the Lijie and Jiangping ships after the fire and damage. The construction was contracted by the Northeast Shipyard in Harbin. The ship's hull armor was purchased from a Czech factory, and the machinery in the cabin was transferred from old merchant ships. The windbags, gun emplacements, lookout towers, and masts were contracted to the German company Siemens. Construction began last winter and the two ships were completed simultaneously a few days ago. The armor is about one and a half inches thick, the gun emplacements have been increased to four, the displacement is 500 tons, the draft is two and a half feet, and the upstream speed is 45 li per hour and the downstream speed is 60 li per hour. All of these have been improved compared to before. Jiangping was originally converted from a merchant ship and could only be used for transportation. Now it has been renovated as well. The two ships were docked simultaneously on May 21, but the sailors have not yet been assigned and the captains have not been announced. The future deployment location will be the Tongjiang-Fujin area. In the future, the river defense warships, including Lisui, Liji, Jiangqing, and Jiangtong, will total six ships. Lichuan has been salvaged and handed over to the shipyard for repair, but construction has not started. Jiangtai and Jiang'an were shattered by artillery fire at the Sanjiangkou during the battle and could not be repaired, so the two ships were completely abandoned. The defense plan of the River Defense Fleet Headquarters will be to have Jiangtong cruise between Huachuan and Yilan, Jiangqing cruise between Yilan and Harbin, and Liji cruise between Jilin and Harbin. Because Russian warships and gunboats patrol the Heilongjiang and Ussuri international rivers every day, Chinese merchant ships are always in great fear when traveling back and forth. For protection purposes, it may be necessary to send Lisui to cruise the Ussuri River and Lijie to cruise the Heilongjiang River. There are not enough river defense sailors and they lack training. The fleet commander Xie Gangzhe has requested and been approved by the headquarters to transfer 200 sailors from the coastal defense, who are expected to arrive by the end of the month. The warship Jiangheng, which sank in Fujin during the Sino-Russian War, was salvaged for a year last year, but due to the deep water, rapid current, and siltation of the ship, it has not been excavated. More than 20,000 yuan was spent on construction costs during the year. This year, the River Defense Department changed the contract to a famous Japanese diving team, and the salvage cost was 30,000 yuan. The salvage has now begun, and it is expected to be completely out of the water in late July. Because the ship has a deeper draft and it is inconvenient to sail to Harbin for repairs, it has been decided to send workers to Fujin for repairs (May 23rd).</p>
<p>Jiaoji Railway</p>
<h3 id="e73">Coal Industry Strike Becomes a Stalemate <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Ministry of Railways Refuses to Cancel Price Increase</p>
<p>Coal Merchants Insist on Withdrawal Before Resuming Transport</p>
<p>Jiaoji Railway Party Headquarters Acts as Mediator</p>
<p>Qingdao Communication: Reports have previously detailed the strike by coal merchants along the Jiaoji Railway line in Zibo, Zhangdian, and Weixian. It is now reported that the Jiaoji Railway Bureau, recognizing the mutual losses to coal merchants and the adverse impact on society due to the work stoppage, repeatedly telegraphed the Ministry of Railways from the start of the strike, seeking a prompt resolution. The bureau received a reply from the Ministry of Railways yesterday, stating that the coal transport price increase could not be canceled, but the railway could consider reducing prices during the summer, following previous practices. The railway expressed hope for a resumption of transport and requested a report. However, the coal merchants, unsatisfied with the unfulfilled demands, insisted on the cancellation of the price increase before resuming transport. Consequently, both sides have taken extreme positions, resulting in a stalemate. The Jiaoji Railway Special Party Headquarters, fearing an indefinite delay that would harm national welfare and the people's livelihood, has stepped in as a mediator, hoping for a swift resolution to this crisis. Yesterday, they also telegraphed the Mining Industry Federation, outlining the reasons for demanding the cancellation of the price increase, requesting a clear response to facilitate mediation. The telegram reads: "To the Zibo Zhangdian Weixian Mining and Coal Industry Federation: We have received your telegram and the personal accounts from representatives Yu Gao, Cai, and Yuan. We respectfully acknowledge all the information. Upon investigation, your industry colleagues have implemented a strike since May 21st due to the failure to have the 20% freight increase rescinded. The sole reason you proclaim is that you cannot bear the losses. Your industry colleagues are esteemed leaders in the commercial sector, renowned far and wide, and would not resort to false claims. If you did not genuinely feel the pain of unbearable losses, you would not have resorted to such drastic measures. However, the market price of coal in Qingdao and along the railway line has consistently been around 24 yuan per ton for the past year, a fact widely known. As for how much profit can be made at this price, the secrets are not accessible to outsiders. However, according to insiders, the cost of coal extracted from the mine is approximately 3.9 yuan per ton, the cost of transporting it from the mine to the Boshan railway station is approximately 3 yuan per ton, and the Jiaoji Railway freight is 4 yuan per ton. The total of these three items is no more than 12 yuan. This is the cost per ton of coal, while the market price is around 24 yuan, making the profit almost equal to the capital, which is very clear. Even if the freight rate is increased by 20%, the cost per ton will increase slightly, but the profit is still considered substantial. We wonder, what is the true reason your industry colleagues claim to be unable to bear the losses? If your industry colleagues wish to achieve the goal of canceling the freight increase, we believe that you should first resume transport, then prepare detailed information about the unbearable losses and present it to the government, making it public nationwide. This should include irrefutable evidence so that even those who doubt it cannot deny it. Once all sectors of society understand the truth, they will naturally express fervent sympathy and offer assistance. If the government is concerned about the people's welfare and sympathizes with the merchants' difficulties, would it disregard your industry colleagues' requests? Even if the government, due to difficulties, cannot adopt your requests, the responsibility for the increase should be borne entirely by the government. Your industry colleagues' hardships will be understood by the entire country. However, since your industry colleagues' strike began, all the letters, telegrams, representative statements, and advertisements, though voluminous, have failed to elaborate on the only reason of unbearable losses, leaving the government and society in doubt, resulting in prolonged delays and a failure to address the key issues. We cannot help but consider this regrettable. Alleviating the suffering of the people is the sole mission of our party. Our association, entrusted with providing assistance, cannot shirk its responsibility. We sincerely hope that your industry colleagues will resume transport as soon as possible and promptly provide detailed information about the unbearable losses caused by the freight increase. We will present the situation to the central authorities for review and approval, and convey it to all parties for unanimous assistance in seeking a swift resolution. We eagerly await your response."

<h3 id="e74">Illegal Execution of Muslim Case <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Autopsy Confirms Death by Kerosene Ingestion</p>
<p>Diplomatic Association Issues Telegram to Advocate Strongly</p>
<p>Shenyang Communication: Mi Shuangzhen and his younger brother Shuangxiang, Muslims from Liaoyang County, have always been law-abiding citizens. However, the local Japanese police station suddenly arrested the brothers a few days ago, subjected them to torture and hanging, and then poured kerosene into Mi Shuangzhen's stomach, causing his immediate death. Mi Shuangxiang has not been released. Upon hearing this, the local Muslims were outraged and went to the county government to demand serious negotiations. The county government protested based on reason, but the Japanese police station strongly denied the accusations, claiming that Shuangzhen's death was due to illness and that there was no torture or kerosene ingestion. The county government then invited a British female doctor from the local public hospital to perform an autopsy. Officials from the Japanese consulate, the police station, and the director of the South Manchuria Railway Hospital were also present at the scene for the examination. The results confirmed severe injuries, and the left lung was collapsed with purulent fluid, indicating that a fatal liquid had indeed been ingested before death. In addition to engaging in serious negotiations, Liaoyang County reported the autopsy findings to the provincial government. The Muslims are also planning to gather representatives from 58 counties in Liaoning Province to hold a meeting at the mosque to discuss negotiation strategies. The provincial Diplomatic Association also issued a telegram yesterday, calling on the people of the country to rise up and fight for justice. The report from Liaoyang County to the provincial government is recorded below: "Report Regarding the Autopsy of County Resident Mi Shuangzhen, Who Was Tortured to Death by the Japanese Police Station, Requesting Review and Approval. The Public Security Bureau reports that Mi Shuangzhen, a resident of the mosque in our jurisdiction, was arrested and tortured to death by the Japanese police station, and Mi Shuangxiang is still detained. The circumstances have been reported previously. The First Precinct of our bureau requested the Liaoyang District Court to conduct an autopsy on April 30th. Prosecutor Zhu Chengbin, accompanied by an autopsy official, went to Mi Changben's house, but found it difficult to determine the cause of death due to the absence of serious injuries on Mi Shuangzhen's skin. Subsequently, on May 2nd, the Prosecutor's Office of the court transported Shuangzhen's body to the public hospital and invited British female doctor Wei Chenguang to perform an autopsy. Chief medical officer of the public hospital, Meng Xianqing, served as the examiner. Chief Prosecutor Wang Lian and Prosecutor Zhu Chengbin of the court were present to oversee the autopsy, along with Wada Masakatsu, Director of Foreign Affairs of the Japanese Consulate, Niizuma Senjuro, Director of Justice of the Japanese Police Station, Iida Hiroshi, Director of the South Manchuria Railway Hospital, Nie Yuzhen, a Chinese doctor at the British Missionary Hospital, and Liu Dingjiu, a doctor at the public hospital. Wang Pengkun, Chief of Duty Supervision, and Xu Boquan, Director of the First Precinct, were dispatched by our bureau to supervise the scene. The autopsy began at 5:30 PM that afternoon. The examination revealed that Mi Shuangzhen's skin had bluish-purple marks on his legs, and there were blue and purple spots below both knees. The left lung was collapsed with approximately 2000 cc of purulent and liquid matter. After extracting the liquid, the left lung was found to be shrunken, and the tail of the lung was also rotten. After the examination, the incision was stitched up, and the body was returned to his relative Mi Changben for preparation and burial. The cause of Mi Shuangzhen's death, whether due to illness or torture, was not definitively determined at the scene and requires further investigation. British female doctor Wei Chenguang issued a written autopsy report in English, but the Japanese doctors did not issue an autopsy report. Public hospital medical officer Meng Xianqing issued an autopsy report with an attached diagram, which was submitted by Xu Boquan, Director of the First Precinct. Upon review, there were no discrepancies. In addition to submitting the report directly and awaiting the submission of the court's investigation form, we have attached Meng Xianqing's autopsy report and diagram to this document for your review and approval for negotiation. While preparing to submit the report, the bureau submitted the court's investigation form. Upon investigation, it was confirmed that Mi Shuangzhen was tortured to death by the Japanese police station by pouring oil into his lungs. This is truly inhumane. In addition to issuing instructions and directly negotiating with the Japanese consulate and submitting a separate report, we have attached the diagram and documents to this document for your review and approval for implementation."</p>

<p>Fishermen Use Witchcraft to Defraud and Obtain Wealth: Shen Yimei and Zhang Genfu, two members of the net-boat gang under Xiaosanliqiao in Beitang, are inherently fierce and good at the art of "releasing madness", often causing people to die. Recently, Shen Yimei suddenly had a dispute with his nephews, Shen Linlin and Shen Shungen, over fishing. The two sides disagreed. Yimei used his witchcraft to kill Shen Shungen's wife and her four-year-old child. Shungen was in great pain and negotiated with Yimei. Yimei knew that things were not good and ran to the fifth sub-bureau of the Public Security Bureau to investigate. Director Peng immediately dispatched several policemen to arrest Shen Shungen and Shen Linlin and sentenced them to ten days of detention as a warning. Shen Linlin and his brothers refused to accept the sentence and filed a lawsuit with the County Court to file a criminal complaint. When Shen Linlin and his brothers were negotiating with Yimei, fishermen from neighboring boats, Zou Hongxing, Zhao Genji, and Zou Fushan, saw the situation and came forward to dissuade them from causing trouble. Shen Yimei considered them accomplices and held a grudge. He also used witchcraft to make Zou's wives sick and claimed that as long as they gave him 60 yuan, the Three Mao Lords could cure their wives' illnesses immediately. Zou Jianyan was planning to go abroad to extend his medical treatment when Shen Yuquan and seven others, who had already been defrauded, told Zou Hongxing the truth. However, Shen Yimei has repeatedly used fraudulent means to defraud others of their wealth, which is not allowed by law. Yesterday, Zhou Beiwu, a lawyer, was hired to write a statement to the Procuratorate of the County Court to file a criminal complaint and requested that Shen Yimei and Zhang Fugeng be arrested and severely punished according to law.</p>

<p>Directors of the Public Cemetery of the Seven Districts</p>
<p>Will go to the Public Cemetery Separately this Morning to Pay Respects</p>
<p>The entire working comrades of the Party Headquarters of the Seven Districts of this city specially prepared wreaths, elegiac couplets, and memorial essays for the commemoration of the May 30th Massacre today. At 8 AM this morning, they will go to the Public Cemetery of the May 30th Martyrs to pay respects. At 6 PM in the afternoon, they will go to the propaganda office attached to the district to promote propaganda and notify the permanent propaganda teams of each branch to set off for propaganda. At the same time, a letter to the public will be published as follows:</p>
<p>A Letter to the Public: The May 30th Massacre was caused by the oppression of our Chinese workers by the Japanese-owned domestic and foreign yarn factories in Shanghai in February of the 14th year of the Republic of China, which led to a strike. They used high-pressure tactics to shoot and kill worker Gu Zhenghong, which aroused the conscious workers and patriotic students of our country to participate in the anti-imperialist movement of our party. On May 30th, a grand anti-imperialist propaganda and demonstration was held in the Shanghai Public Concession. A tragic scene was enacted by the imperialist police chief, Ewart, ordering the police to open fire and brutally kill patriotic unarmed people. After reading the facts above, we know that the imperialists generally used a policy of massacre against the Chinese National Revolutionary Movement. May 30th was the National Revolutionary Movement led by our party's premier. The imperialists saw the self-consciousness of the Chinese nation and could not help but panic. Therefore, they did not hesitate to violate justice and humanity and used a policy of massacre to maintain their unreasonably and unequally acquired superior rights. However, in fact, our country's revolutionary movement has only progressed as a result of this, and our country's people have only become more conscious and concentrated under the banner of our party. In the shortest possible time, the Northern Expedition was completed, the imperialist pawns were eliminated, and the foundations of imperialist aggression in China were shaken. Recently, the central government followed the premier's last wishes and convened a National Congress in the capital, gathering national elites to discuss national affairs and passed a resolution to automatically abolish unequal treaties. This is really something that our people should rejoice and be encouraged by. People, work hard to overthrow all imperialism and abolish unequal treaties.</p>
<p>The Board of Directors of the May 30th Martyrs Public Cemetery is scheduled to hold a public memorial service at the May 30th Martyrs Public Cemetery in Fangjia Wooden Bridge, Zhabei at 9 AM this morning (30th). The order and memorial essay are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Public Memorial Order: (1) The master of ceremonies takes his place (2) The presiding officer takes his place (3) The assisting officer takes his place (4) Bow three times to the national flag and the premier's portrait (5) Read the premier's will (6) Bow three times to the martyrs' tomb (7) Offer flowers (8) Offer fruits (9) Read the memorial essay (10) Silent for three minutes (11) Assist officer retreats (12) The presiding officer retreats (13) The master of ceremonies retreats (14) The ceremony is complete</p>
<p>Memorial Essay to the Martyrs: On the 30th day of May in the 20th year of the Republic of China, the directors of the May 30th Martyrs Public Cemetery, Chairman Yu Qiaqing, Directors Cheng Xiechun, Lin Kanghou, Wang Xiaolai, Yuan Ludeng, Zhu Yinjiang, Ye Huijun, Gu Xinyi, Wu Zhihao, Wang Hanliang, Wang Binyan, Qin Runqing, Wang Yansong, Zhao Jinqing, Lu Fengzhu, and others, with incense, flowers, and pure crowds, pay tribute to the spirits of the martyrs who died on May 30th, 14th year of the Republic of China, saying: Alas, the martyrs became benevolent for the country, grieving the loss of sovereignty and struggling to save their lives. They awakened the hearts of the people in numbness, and their deaths shocked them. Seven years of bloodshed still terrify the powerful. The bodies were displayed for a hundred steps, and the compatriots who passed by were still shocked. We mourn the passing of the martyrs and lament the existence of the concession. Although the Council of Concessions has become a historical relic, the unsettled case of building roads beyond the boundary is still being pursued. We recall the martyrs' dedication and their sincere hearts for the country. We recall the efforts of our comrades, who have not done enough. We strive unremittingly to gain every inch and walk with swords and shoes. We pray for equality and leave behind our legacy to restore the country's sovereignty and vow to achieve our goal without sacrifice. May your souls come and bless us. Alas, enjoy the sacrifice.</p>

<p>Hope for Peaceful Resolution of the Guangdong Situation Still Exists</p>
<p>Sun Ke is Surrounded by Circumstances</p>
<p>Central Committee member Li Shizeng came to Shanghai the day before yesterday to further mediate the Guangdong situation. Yesterday morning at 10 AM, Mr. Li went to Haig Road to visit Wu Tiecheng, and at 2 PM he visited again for detailed discussions.

Therefore, he firmly believes that the hope for peace has not been completely severed. When asked about the truth regarding Sun Ke's departure from Guangdong, Mr. Li replied that when Sun was in Shanghai, he repeatedly stated that his goal was to mediate and reconcile. However, after arriving in Guangdong, there was a sudden change, which was likely due to being surrounded by circumstances. He still hopes that Sun can adhere to his original intention and mediate for peace. Mr. Zhang Puquan's return to Shanghai is not yet scheduled. In short, regardless of the situation, they will continue to strive to achieve peace, he said.</p>

This has been a planned project for several months, and I agreed with the government some time ago to go to Europe to take office after the drafting of the Provisional Constitution is completed. Therefore, I have already telegraphed the International Court of Justice to confirm my acceptance of the position. Now that the procedures for my passport have been completed, I will be leaving the country soon.</p>

<p>Sichuan Shipping Merchants</p>
<h3 id="e93">Resisting Foreign Ship Monopoly <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Sichuan Merchants Stop Loading Foreign Ships</p>
<p>Workers Unanimously Refuse to Load and Unload</p>
<p>A Prelude to Recovering Navigation Rights on the Yangtze River</p>
<p>Recently, foreign ships have been monopolizing navigation rights on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River from Yichang to Chongqing, arousing Chinese merchants to stop loading and refuse transport. And Chinese... resisted... big... The Director of the Chongqing Navigation Bureau, He Beiheng, has come to Shanghai specifically for this matter to discuss rescue measures with various shipping bureaus and has gone to the capital to report everything to the Ministry of Communications. This matter is of great importance to navigation rights. The reporter went to various parties to investigate as follows:</p>
<p>Foreign Merchants' Monopoly Plan: On the Shanghai-Yichang-Chongqing route, there are five foreign merchants, including Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, Nisshin Kisen, Chekiang River Steam Navigation Co., and Jufuk, with a total of more than 30 ships. The largest business on this route is yarn and cloth. Foreign merchants have long intended to occupy the Sichuan River shipping industry, but they cannot succeed with Chinese ships involved. Therefore, each foreign merchant plans to drastically reduce freight rates. They propose to reduce the freight rate for yarn and cloth from Shanghai to Chongqing by four taels per piece. Once implemented, Chinese ships will not be able to withstand the losses and will inevitably have to suspend all operations. At that time, foreign merchants will buy up all the Chinese ships and bring all the Sichuan River shipping into foreign hands, and then raise the freight rate for yarn and cloth to 30 taels per piece. Chinese merchants will have to submit to their demands. This plan is about to be implemented, and Chinese ships have received the news with great alarm and are urgently seeking to rescue the situation.</p>
<p>Recovery of the Xufu-Luzhou Navigation Line: The Xufu-Luzhou line in the upper reaches of the Sichuan River is an inland area. In recent years, British, Japanese, and American ships have extended their navigation lines, and more than ten ships operating on the Xufu-Luzhou line have expelled more than a hundred civilian barge boats. The Chongqing Navigation Bureau resisted, stating that foreign ships were not allowed to navigate inland. Businessmen in Xufu and Luzhou also unanimously refused to load. The Sichuan authorities also came forward to assist. Taikoo and Nisshin Kisen’s Weiding, Jintang, Xiushan, and Jialing Maru and Mausoleum Maru, which operated on the Xufu-Luzhou line, have now been removed from the route and have suspended operations. Navigation rights on this route have been recovered.</p>
<p>Sichuan Merchants Refuse to Load Foreign Ships: In order to save navigation rights, each Sichuan River shipping bureau and the yarn and cloth industry in Yichang and Chongqing, as well as eight trade associations such as customs brokers, barge associations, packaging coolies, and machinery industries, jointly organized a business transportation joint conference. It was decided that starting today (approximately June 1st), Sichuan merchants would use the clear order issued by the Central Government for domestic goods to be transported on domestic ships as a reason to stop loading foreign ships. On the worker side, foreign ships operating direct Shanghai-Chongqing services would cut off the livelihoods of Yichang workers. All foreign ships transporting goods from Shanghai to Chongqing would not be allowed to be loaded or unloaded on their behalf, and goods loaded on ships in Chongqing would not be allowed to be loaded onto foreign ships, and all work would be refused.</p>
<p>Chinese Ship Alliance: There are seven Chinese ships on the Sichuan River, including China Merchants, Sanbei, China Xing, Shu Ping, Yujiang, Yong Qing, and Sichuan Jiang, with a total of eight ships, including Emei, Wuxing, Fuyang, Fushun, Yongfeng, Wan An, and Shuheng. They have now formed an alliance and stand on the same front. The eight companies agreed that this time to resist foreign ships (1) prices are not allowed to be privately increased during shallow water periods, (2) prices are not allowed to be reduced during high water periods, (3) schedules are first come, first served, and no competition is allowed, (4) if there are any public duties, each company shall bear them jointly, and no one or two ships shall suffer losses alone, (5) important matters in business and foreign affairs shall be reported to the business transportation joint conference for management.</p>
<p>Director of the Navigation Bureau Comes to Shanghai: After the issue of resisting foreign ship monopoly arose, Director of the Navigation Bureau He Beiheng recognized that this matter had great significance for Sichuan River shipping, commerce, and diplomacy. He personally went east from Chongqing to Shanghai to discuss rescue measures with the persons in charge of each shipping bureau, requesting that each shipping bureau increase the number of ships to the Sichuan River when necessary to meet the needs of the business community. Each shipping bureau has agreed. Mr. He has also gone to Nanjing to report the course of events to the Ministry of Communications and seek substantial assistance from the government. The Ministry of Communications has agreed. It is reported that Mr. He will return to Chongqing within two or three days.</p>
<p>British Ships Postpone Trip to Chongqing: There are still two British merchant ships in this port that have not gone to Chongqing. They originally planned to load goods and depart immediately, but suddenly heard of a trend of resisting foreign ships in Chongqing. Fearing that the ships would be obstructed upon arrival, they postponed their departure and dared not transport goods for export. They first telegraphed Sichuan to inquire and then decide on a plan.</p>
<p>Is it a Relapse of American Soldiers' Misconduct?</p>
<h3 id="e94">Another Sailor Causes Trouble <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Qichang Pier Area in Pudong</p>
<p>American Sailor Injures People with a Knife</p>
<p>Recently, American sailors have continuously caused incidents of injuring Chinese people without cause. The newspapers have reported these incidents, causing alarm and shock, and everyone is filled with indignation. Unexpectedly, another American sailor injured people with a knife in the Qichang Pier area in Pudong the night before last. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The commercial district of Qichang Pier in Pudong is quite prosperous and not far from the Huangpu River. At 7 PM the night before last, an American sailor from the Atlanta City merchant ship, managed by the American company Jiangtian and docked at the pier there, went ashore from the pier and went straight to the main street of the town, carrying a sharp knife about eight inches long, rushing around recklessly. Chinese people saw that he had a weapon and fled in all directions. At that time, many dock coolies had finished eating at a restaurant at No. 126 in the town and were leaving the restaurant when they encountered the sailor rushing towards them head-on, raising his knife to stab them. The coolies had no choice but to quickly retreat back into the restaurant to hide, and the sailor also chased into the restaurant. The coolies and the restaurant diners and staff all fled out of the door. The restaurant owner, Chen Zhusheng, fearing that he would cause trouble, rushed to report to the police station of the third district of the nearby Public Security Bureau. At that time, the American sailor saw that there was no one in the restaurant and returned to the street, where he happened to meet Yang Jin'er, a coolie from Jiangbei, passing by. He suddenly raised his knife and stabbed Yang violently in the right leg, about five inches long. Yang fell to the ground in extreme pain.</p>

<p>When Officer Sun Deshi saw this, he ran over to stop him from committing further violence. Unexpectedly, the sailor was unreasonable and raised his knife to stab the officer, who quickly dodged, but his right hand was also stabbed. The sailor then punched Wang Jinfa, the boss of the Xinshunchang ferry, in the right eye, and Ma Lin, a coolie, was slightly wounded on the left cheek. After causing the trouble, he fled back to the original ship. Afterwards, Patrol Leader Shen from the police station took the injured people aboard the ship to investigate and learned that the perpetrator's name was Adorno Lucy Steve (transliteration), who worked as a stoker in the fire cabin. The ship owner learned of this and tied up the perpetrator with a rope, expressing his responsibility to punish the perpetrator. Patrol Leader Shen then returned to the station and reported the situation to the Third District by telephone. District Chief Zhang reported it to the Public Security Bureau for verification. The local Fifth District Party Headquarters also sent a letter to the Third District yesterday, inquiring about the truth of the handling of the case. District Chief Zhang immediately sent Patrol Leader Fan to the Party Headquarters to reply according to the situation.</p>
<h3 id="e95">The Xin Case Resolved Successfully <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The French Authorities Acknowledge Compensation and Apology</p>
<p>The Support Association Held a Meeting Yesterday to End</p>
<p>New Voice News Agency reports that on April 7, a Western policeman from the French Concession Police Station shot a pedestrian on Yong'an Street for no reason, seriously injuring Xin Haishan, an employee of Changhe Firm. After the incident, all sectors were filled with righteous indignation and held an aid conference at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce on April 28 to expand negotiations. Eleven representatives from various sectors were elected to form the Shanghai Support Xin Haishan Case Committee to handle the matter specifically. Together with the French Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association, Chinese Director Du Yuesheng, Ningbo Fellow Association, and other groups, they requested party and government agencies to forward the matter for serious negotiations with the French Consul. After several twists and turns and countless efforts, the French Consul was finally willing to negotiate sincerely. After Du Yuesheng mediated vigorously, an agreement was reached with the French Consul on compensation, apology, punishing the perpetrator, and guarantees. The Support Association agreed with the points proposed by Mr. Du and held a final committee meeting at the Citizen Federation Association on the third floor yesterday to end the matter. The attending committee members included Zheng Chengqing, Sun Mingqi, Ye Jiaxing, Sun Shouchang, Mao Chunpu, Shao Baoxing, Yuan Hongyue, Dong Xinqin, etc. Chairman Ye Jiaxing reported on the receipt and dispatch of documents. Then, Shao Baoxing and others reported on the negotiation process and the situation of collecting compensation fees together with the family members. The following resolutions were made: (1) Send a letter to the French Consul expressing the Association's agreement with the three points of compensation, apology, and punishing the perpetrator mediated by Mr. Du Yuesheng, but the Consul should still be responsible for medical expenses and should promptly report to our country's authorities. The case was resolved and approved and reported to the municipal government for record. (2) The negotiations on this case have concluded and letters of thanks should be sent to various groups that provided assistance. The case was resolved and approved and then ended and adjourned.</p>
<p>Industry and Commerce News Agency reports that the case of Yongren Xin Haishan being shot for no reason by a Western policeman from the French Concession has been actively negotiated by various groups organizing the Xin Case Support Association. According to reliable news yesterday, in this case, Chinese Director Du Yuesheng of the French Public Works Bureau mediated and decided to negotiate with Zheng Chengqing, Shao Baoxing, Dong Xinqin, and other responsible representatives of the Support Association (1) the French Public Works Bureau will compensate Xin Haishan 1,000 yuan for damages (2) the offending patrolman will be dismissed and severely punished (3) a verbal apology will be made to our government (4) all medical and nursing expenses for Xin Haishan's current stay in the hospital until the date of discharge will be borne by the French side. The Support Association held a meeting yesterday and decided to accept Mr. Du's mediation after the three representatives reported on the situation. This case will be resolved accordingly. It is reported that the Support Association will report the negotiation process to the Social Affairs Bureau and handle the closing of the association.</p>
<h3 id="e96">All Sectors are Indignant About the Qu Case <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Unanimous Support</p>
<p>The Anhui Fellow Association sent a letter to the Foreign Affairs Office stating: It is reported that members of our association, Ding Zigu, Wang Haiqing, and Wang Zhaoyong, reported to the association that fellow Qu Shixiang, a native of Tongcheng, is 41 years old and runs the Qu Shunji Clothing Store at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Gordon Road. Ma Duanxiang, a native of Hefei, is a partner of Qu Shunji. On the night of the 26th of this month, around 10 PM, two American sailors and another Westerner in plain clothes were riding in a rickshaw from east to west. One of the sailors had an argument with the rickshaw puller over the fare, and the sailor's hat was blown off his head by the wind and fell to the ground. At that time, Qu Shixiang's son, Qu Heigou, was playing at the door and saw the sailor's hat fall to the ground. He picked it up and returned it, which angered the sailor. The sailor jumped out of the rickshaw and beat Heigou. Qu's partner, Ma Ruixiang, stepped forward to dissuade him and was stabbed wildly by the sailor with the bayonet he was carrying, causing serious injuries to Ma's head, neck, waist, and abdomen. Qu Shixiang heard the noise and came out to see what was happening. He was also stabbed in the head and left arm, causing serious injuries. Except for Qu Heigou, who suffered minor injuries and is being treated at home, Qu and Ma were both sent to Baolong Hospital for treatment by the police. This was an unexpected disaster, and their lives are in danger. We request assistance in negotiating. Our association immediately held an emergency meeting, and the public was outraged by the unreasonable violence of the American sailors. We immediately sent people to Baolong Hospital to investigate the injuries of Qu and Ma. After the doctor's examination, it was confirmed that their lives were in danger. For days, reports have been published stating that American sailors wielded weapons and committed violence at will, causing Qu and Ma to be seriously injured. This proves that those imperialists treat the lives of our Chinese people like toys and run rampant in our country's territory. The case of Dai Tingzuo, a coolie at the Jinliyuan Pier, being pushed into the river and killed by an American sailor has not been settled for many days, and then this case occurred. The lives of Chinese people in the concession are constantly in danger, and humanity and justice have been completely extinguished. All Chinese people are indignant. For this reason, we hereby send a letter requesting your office to lodge a serious protest in order to achieve the purpose of punishing the perpetrators during this period of recovering legal rights, so as to uphold justice and avenge grievances. We await your urgent orders. May 29th, to the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Shanghai Bar Association, the Jing'an Temple Police Station, and the Bao Hospital. (The letters are omitted.) The association has also reported the case to the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting that the US authorities lodge a serious protest, and requesting the support of the municipal government, the municipal chamber of commerce, and the Chinese Ratepayers Association in this port.</p>

<h3 id="e102">Two Important Telegrams from the Tax Regulations Association <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Cancellation of Business Tax on Timberyard Brokers</p>
<p>Reduction of Export Tax Rate on Eggs</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Tax Regulations Research Committee of the various trade associations in this city sent separate telegrams to the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Legislative Yuan, and the Ministry of Finance regarding the Fujian Provincial Department of Finance's forceful collection of business tax on timberyard brokers and the increased export tax rate on eggs. They requested tax reduction and exemption. The telegrams read: (1) Respectfully to the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters: It is our understanding that the collection of business tax should be limited to those engaged in business activities. Brokers who only buy and do not sell should naturally be exempt. This matter was previously submitted to the Ministry of Finance, which approved and instructed accordingly, and was explicitly announced by the Ministry of Finance on May 2nd, including these brokers within the scope of tax exemption. However, the Fujian Provincial Department of Finance has disregarded central government orders, sending armed police with guns and ammunition to forcefully collect business tax from timberyard brokers in Fujian. Despite repeated appeals and petitions from these brokers, the department officials have stated that the central government's orders are not convenient for Fujian Province to consider. This is utterly unreasonable. We hereby respectfully request that your esteemed department swiftly order the Fujian Provincial Department of Finance to immediately cancel this tax to uphold government orders. We await your instructions with utmost urgency. Respectfully, the Tax Regulations Research Committee of the various trade associations of Shanghai. (2) Respectfully to the Nanjing National Government Legislative Yuan and Ministry of Finance: We have received a letter from the Egg Trade Association stating that in the new export tax regulations, taxes on tea, silk, and soybean oil have been reduced or exempted, but the tax rates on fresh eggs, dried eggs, wet eggs, and frozen eggs exported by our industry have not been reduced but have instead been significantly increased. This seems inconsistent with the National Government's policy of developing international trade and may be due to a misunderstanding. As the new tax regulations are scheduled to take effect on June 1st, we urgently request that your esteemed council swiftly telegraph the National Government, the Legislative Yuan, and the Ministry of Finance to reconsider and temporarily suspend the implementation of the new tax rates on the above-mentioned egg products, continuing to levy taxes at the old rates, which would be in the public interest. Upon investigation, eggs are a subsidiary agricultural product of great importance to the livelihoods of the entire population. In recent years, due to the convenience of transportation and the ability to maintain the freshness of eggs from Russia, the Netherlands, and Poland, Chinese products have found it difficult to compete. Furthermore, according to a Reuters dispatch from London reported on April 24th, European egg production has increased significantly this year, increasing by 30% compared to last year, excluding Poland and Russia. Russia will sell 200,000 large cases cheaply. If the price of Chinese eggs is not drastically reduced, the European and American markets will undoubtedly be completely occupied. Moreover, the Russian government has even allocated 64 million rubles specifically to develop chicken farming and expand egg trade, with a plan to be completed within two years. This does not seem conducive to fair competition. It is our understanding that the government's main objective is to encourage foreign trade. We approve of the previous letter and hereby appeal that you earnestly instruct for a re-evaluation and reduction of tax rates. Before a revised tax rate is established, we request that the old tax rates be temporarily maintained to protect the people's livelihood and benefit commerce. This is in the public interest. Respectfully, the Tax Regulations Research Committee of the various trade associations of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Yarn Association</p>
<h3 id="e103">Request for Exemption from Consolidated Tax on Stocked Yarn <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Cotton Mill Association submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance for exemption from the consolidated tax on stocked yarn, stating: "Our telegram requested that yarn already outside the manufacturing plant as of April 15th should have its original ownership canceled and be exempt from the re-levy of the consolidated tax. We requested approval and prompt action from the Consolidated Tax Bureau. It has been ten days since this request, and we have not yet received a reply, causing great anxiety. The sale of yarn is already sluggish, and if this stocked yarn is subject to the consolidated tax, it will be difficult to sell, leading to prolonged stockpiling, increased interest, and potential impact on quality. We earnestly request that you consider the difficulties faced by the mills and maintain the exemption for this yarn by instructing the Consolidated Tax Bureau to exempt all such yarn to facilitate gradual sales and avoid additional losses. We await your urgent instructions with utmost anticipation."</p>
<p>Yarn Association Requests Change</p>
<h3 id="e104">Tax Collection Method for Yarn Transported to Liaoning <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Cotton Mill Association sent a special communication to the Liaoning Provincial Department of Finance regarding the collection of consolidated tax on yarn transported to Liaoning, stating: "According to the Shanghai office of your esteemed department's Consolidated Tax Bureau, your office's consolidated tax will be levied starting June 1st. All yarn transported to Liaoning that has already been subject to the consolidated tax will be subject to the consolidated tax again, and the originally collected tax will then be refunded by the Ministry of Finance's Consolidated Tax Bureau. As Liaoning and Shanghai are both under the central government, tax collection should be consistent. If the above method is followed, the procedure of re-levying taxes that have already been levied and refunded will only add unnecessary complexity. In addition, it may be difficult for manufacturers to bear the financial burden. Would it be possible to change the method so that all yarn that has already been subject to the consolidated tax is exempted from further tax collection upon transportation to Liaoning? The Consolidated Tax Bureau can then record the shipments based on transport licenses, and the Ministry of Finance's Consolidated Tax Bureau can refund the full amount based on these records. Such a change would not harm your esteemed department's tax revenue in any way, while providing a significant convenience to manufacturers. We earnestly request that you consider the difficulties faced by businesses and grant our request. We are deeply grateful."</p>
<h3 id="e105">Letter from Taxpayers' Association to the Municipal Council <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association sent two letters to Mr. Jones, the Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement yesterday. The letters are recorded below.</p>
<p>Advance Notice Before Tax Collection: We are writing regarding a letter received from Mr. Yu Ming, a taxpayer residing at No. 1358, Anqing Lane, Hart Road, stating: "This morning, three Chinese and Western officials from the Municipal Council came to my residence to collect the summer police rate (i.e., house rate). As the person in charge of money matters was out, my mother negotiated with them, explaining that the relevant party was not home and had not received advance notice, and therefore had not prepared the funds. She asked if it would be possible to delay payment for a few days. She then paid the full amount as requested. Her tone was peaceful and polite. Unexpectedly, they abused their power and were uncontrollably rude, saying, 'If your family has no money, you can quickly pawn your belongings. If you delay any further, we will send you to the station.' Such behavior would be considered officials intimidating ordinary people even in an autocratic era. It is shocking that such blatant and bizarre incidents occur in Shanghai, which is hailed as civilized. Chinese people residing in the Settlement are subjected to unequal treatment beyond counting, and the unreasonable threats and oppression faced when collecting house rates are just one example. It is common for residents to be unable to pay immediately when people are suddenly sent to collect taxes without 'formal notice' beforehand. It is not an unreasonable request to ask for a few days' extension. What laws have been violated that they were subjected to such abusive language and threats of arrest? Although this unreasonable treatment is insignificant to my residence, I sincerely fear that these people will abuse their power and leave a bad influence. There are numerous cases of Chinese people in the Settlement being subjected to the same unreasonable treatment without a place to express their grievances. Therefore, to protect the dignity of all Chinese people in the Settlement, I am reporting the actual situation and requesting your association to uphold justice and thoroughly address this issue to quell public anger, which would not only benefit my family but also be greatly appreciated by all Chinese people." While processing this matter, we also received a letter from a taxpayer residing at No. 1486, Jiahe Lane, Hart Road, stating: "This morning, officials from the Settlement, including one Westerner and three Chinese, came to Jiahe Lane on Hart Road to collect the summer police rate for this year. I had just returned yesterday from Zhejiang Province, where I was recruiting new soldiers on the orders of the National Government's Guard Division, and I planned to go to the capital to collect my salary on June 2nd or 3rd, so I had not prepared the police rate. However, the Westerner and the Chinese officials relied on their power and forced me to go to the police station." This was later resolved through the mediation of neighbors. The Westerner stated that he would come to collect the rate at 10:00 AM on June 1st. However, as I will not return to Shanghai until June 2nd or 3rd, I fear that my family will be humiliated. Therefore, I am writing to request your association to forward a letter to the Municipal Council's Rate Office, requesting that the Westerner come to collect the rate on the afternoon of June 3rd, and I also request your association to legally protect me. Upon investigating the matter, we found that the collection of police rates should be done uniformly by sending a formal written notice to taxpayers fourteen days in advance to allow them to prepare. We have also instructed that the collectors should adopt a peaceful attitude and not be rude. We have already written to your council to request that you take these points into consideration. In response to the previous letters, we are writing to request that you promptly investigate and handle this matter to avoid discrepancies in treatment and prevent disputes.</p>
<p>Request for Explanation of Property Rate: We are writing regarding the statement published by your council in the 20th issue of the 2nd phase of the Municipal Gazette on May 20th, regarding the valuation of house rentals, which stated that "The standard for the valuation of house rentals adopted is the same as that adopted for the past sixty years, and not only has no change been adopted, but no change has even been considered." This association believes that it would be quite in line with the hopes of the taxpayers if this were actually the case. However, this association still has doubts about the proviso in Clause 9 of the Land Regulations cited in the statement, which states "The land rate shall not exceed one two-thousandth of the land price, and the house rate shall not exceed one percent of the annual house rental." We would like to know the actual amount of tax payable in specific cases. For example, if the land price is 10,000 taels of silver, how many taels of silver should be collected annually so that it does not exceed one two-thousandth of the land price? Also, if the annual house rental is 1,200 taels of silver, how many taels of silver should be collected annually so that it does not exceed one percent of the annual house rental? We are writing to request that your council promptly provide clarification to avoid misunderstandings.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Real Estate Association received a reply from the Municipal Council, stating: "We acknowledge receipt of your esteemed letter of May 20th with thanks.

The Board believes that no changes should be made until Judge Feetham's full report has been completed. We reply accordingly, hoping you will find this satisfactory."</p>

<p>Yesterday's Reception of Chinese and Foreign Guests</p>
<p>Including Li Shizeng, Kong Xiangxi, and Others</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting and his wife held a garden party at the Foreign Ministry's Shanghai Office on Fenglin Bridge to receive guests from all circles, both Chinese and foreign. The road beside Fenglin Bridge was congested with cars. Among the foreign guests were the Japanese Minister Shigemitsu Mamoru, the Swedish Minister Hederstedt, consuls from various countries, commercial representatives, and the Japanese naval attaché. Chinese guests included Minister of Industry Kong Xiangxi, Central Committee member Li Shizeng, Envoy to Germany Chiang Tso-pin, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Chia-chen, Zhang Qun, Wu Jingxiong, Yang Zhaoyun, Qian Xinzhi, Guo Dehua, Guo Bingwen, Xu Jianping, Li Zushen, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, Qian Jiecun, and media representatives such as Shi Liangcai, Zhang Zhuping, Wang Boqi, and Dong XianGuang. Foreign Minister Wang and his wife, along with the Director of the Foreign Office, Tang Liu, and his wife, Diao Minqian, and Wu Tianfang, personally extended cordial hospitality. A dance hall was set up in the Foreign Ministry building. Exquisite refreshments were provided in the garden, along with musical entertainment. The atmosphere was enhanced by various recreational activities and the singing of the Shanghai University string orchestra. A gentle breeze blew, adding to the enjoyment. Guests began to depart around 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>The anticipated arrival of the yachts was eagerly awaited for days, but from Tuesday to Thursday, there was still no news. It was not until 7:30 AM yesterday that one of the two yachts that had caused so much anticipation, the "Kliton," finally appeared in the open sea off Nagasaki, near the island of Shinshima, riding the waves. The German flag of black, white, and red waved in the vast sea. It is no exaggeration that the Japanese described the scene with the phrase "heroic posture." As the "Kliton" approached the quarantine station, a customs launch sailed to direct it to stop. Newspaper reporters all boarded the launch and eagerly climbed aboard the yacht. The owner, Mr. Ostedt, and Messrs. Blanc Douva Kler and others were all dressed in white, full of energy, and worthy of being called veteran sailors. The interior of the yacht was also extremely well-organized. Despite the six-day sea journey, there was no sign of disorder.</p>
<p>A Very Pleasant Trip: The owner, Mr. Ostedt, asked the Reuters reporter, "Have you heard if the 'Nidaros' has arrived yet?" Then he said to himself, "Why hasn't it arrived yet? Could something have happened?" A worried look appeared on his face, but then he smiled and said, "In that case, we will win the trophy!" His meaning was that the first to arrive at the port would have a chance to win the trophy. Later, he said, "Although the trip was hard, the crew were all healthy and well. The route was followed as planned. We did not have any contact with the 'Nidaros' during the trip, so we can only wait for its arrival after landing. We will still return on the original yacht and prepare sufficient food. The small boats of the Nagasaki and Shanghai bureaus set out from us, it was a very pleasant journey," and so on. The "Kliton" departed from Shanghai</p>

<p>The Brave Feat of Two Sailing Boats is a Success</p>
<h3 id="e112">Safely Arrived in Nagasaki Yesterday <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>"Kliton" Arrived First Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>"Nidaros" Arrived Three Hours Later</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Welcome from the Citizens of Nagasaki</p>
<p>Return Journey Still Made on Original Boats</p>
<p>The "Kliton" and "Nidaros" sailing boats (also known as "floating boats") set sail from Shanghai at 3:30 PM last Saturday and headed straight for Nagasaki. The daring adventure of small boats crossing the ocean was hailed as a heroic feat. The two sailing boats safely arrived in Nagasaki yesterday at 8:30 AM and 11:30 AM respectively. Tens of thousands of local residents went to the shore to welcome them, making it a grand occasion rarely seen in recent years. The "Kliton" arrived earlier, taking 136 hours for the voyage. The "Nidaros" arrived three hours later, taking 139 hours. Special reports are detailed below.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Arrival: The "Kliton" and "Nidaros" sailing boats set sail from the Huangpu River on the same day and headed east. The Asia Queen of the Changxing Company encountered the "Nidaros" on the ocean surface at 11:30 AM the next morning. The "Kliton" did not encounter it due to a different route. After that, news of the two boats disappeared. Everyone was worried, especially in Nagasaki, because the boats were originally scheduled to arrive on Tuesday. The journey took a total of six days, averaging 14 to 30 nautical miles per day.</p>
<p>Still a Competition: The "Kliton" arrived in Nagasaki at 8:30 AM yesterday. The "Nidaros" also arrived at 11:30 AM, and the citizens welcomed it as before. The crew members of the two boats shook hands, which was especially joyous. According to the United Press, Mr. Ostedt, the owner of the "Kliton," said that they had parted ways with the "Nidaros" at Wusongkou at 3:00 PM on the 23rd. His boat headed south, while the "Nidaros" headed north. They did not see each other after that afternoon. The "Kliton" encountered headwinds several times during the trip, but the voyage was still relatively smooth. Aside from breaking four glasses, there were no other losses. The speed averaged from 14 to 30 miles per day. The fresh meat ration ran out last night. We expected to enter the port of Nagasaki by midnight last night, but due to quarantine and other matters, it was delayed. We had to temporarily anchor near the island of Onna in the Goto Islands. It is possible that a small sailboat race between Shanghai and Nagasaki will be held within this year. This time, it is scheduled to stay in Nagasaki for two or three days before sailing back to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Russian Used Drugged Water to Subdue a Woman</p>
<h3 id="e113">Theft of a Huge Sum of Money <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Li Fu's Deception Due to Quitting Smoking</p>
<p>More Than Four Thousand Yuan Vanished</p>
<p>Li Fu, a resident of No. 35, Yuanye Road, French Concession, reported to the French police a few days ago that she had been victimized by a Russian named Gunisav, residing at No. 30, Taoerfeisi Road, who conspired with his son Yinihi to use anesthetic water to subdue the woman and then steal 4,500 yuan in cash. She requested an investigation. After receiving the report, the police chief immediately ordered detectives to arrest the Gunisav father and son and detain them in the police station. Yesterday, they were brought before the French court for questioning. First, the plaintiff, Li Fu, stated that she had a smoking habit but had long resolved to quit but had no good medicine. Coincidentally, her younger brother came a few days ago and said that he had two Russian friends (i.e., the defendants) who had been practicing medicine in Beiping and were particularly skilled in helping people quit smoking. When the woman heard this, she believed it to be true and asked him to introduce them to her. I asked them how much it would cost to quit, and they replied that they were friends and would not charge any money and said they guaranteed that I would be free in a month. I immediately took out a packet of powder and gave it to me to swallow. However, I never liked to take powder, so I asked them to switch to drug water. The defendants agreed and left. The next day, they came again with a bottle of drug water and asked me to smell it once or twice. I felt a slight perfume smell. After a while, the defendants took the bottle away. I asked them to put it in my place, and they said that the water had to be mixed at any time and could not be left behind. On the 21st of this month, they came again and took out another bottle of water and asked me to smell it. Unexpectedly, the woman immediately fainted on the opium couch and lost consciousness. The defendants took the opportunity to steal all the 4,500 yuan of cash beside the woman. (Note: This money was temporarily borrowed from the plaintiff by the elder sister, Di Fuwenying, in Suzhou for her son's marriage. The plaintiff asked her younger brother to withdraw it from the Zhejiang Industrial Bank and send it to Suzhou. When her elder sister already had the money, she returned it to Shanghai and gave it to the plaintiff for safekeeping when the defendants arrived.) After about half an hour, the woman woke up and found that the money was gone. She went to the defendants' house to ask, but only the first defendant's wife was at home. She asked the wife, who said that the defendants were not at home. Therefore, she reported to the police for arrest. This is the truth. She also hired lawyer Ba He to represent everything. The defendants denied the theft. The Chinese and Western officials ordered the defendants to hand over the money and be released on bail to await the police to investigate the facts before questioning them again.</p>
<p>Women Chasing After</p>
<h3 id="e114">Shouting to Catch Thieves <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The Maid is the Accomplice and Fled</p>
<p>The Apprentice Said the Master Was Holding Him Captive</p>
<p>At around 2:00 AM yesterday, constables Hui Jianting of the nineteenth post of the third district and Shen Hui of the fourteenth post heard someone shouting "Catch the thief!" while they were on guard duty at Xiaonanmen. They quickly turned around to investigate and saw a man running towards them under the dim streetlights, with a woman chasing after him, shouting "Catch the thief!" repeatedly. They immediately joined forces to intercept the two and took them back to the police station. The director of the station, Director Jin, interrogated them. According to the woman, she was Zhou Xu, 34 years old, from Lishui, residing at No. 4, Jingye Lane, Dingfu Wharf, Wangjia Wharf. Her husband, Xu Fengshan, is currently a detective in the Shanghai County Public Security Bureau. The man (referring to the arrested person) is Xu Da, who lives in Qidong. He is my husband's apprentice. Because he was doing things improperly, my husband specially summoned him to my house today to send him back to his hometown. Unexpectedly, he took advantage of our unpreparedness and secretly sneaked out. I discovered this and tried my best to chase after him. Because I was exhausted and hoarse, I had to shout "Catch the thief!" in order to get passersby to help me chase him. Xu Da, the defendant, stated that he was 27 years old, from Qidong County. Xu Fengshan is indeed my master. I used to farm for a living in my hometown. Because bandits harassed the area year after year, some bandits even occupied my house. They robbed during the day and stayed in my house at night. Because these people were numerous and powerful, I had no way to drive them away. Unexpectedly, the neighbors nearby misunderstood and said that I was hiding the bandits, so I have been deeply hated. Last year, all the bandits in the area were wiped out by the army, and the bandits who had occupied my house were scattered. My neighbors even set fire to my house, leaving me with nowhere to live. So, I came to Shanghai and rented a house at No. 22, Daxing Street, and truthfully reported the situation to my master, Xu Fengshan. In the twelfth month of the lunar calendar, Xu Fengshan arrested seven bandits in Shanghai, all of whom were evildoers in Qidong County. After confirming the interrogation, four of the bandits were executed on the spot in Qidong County. The remaining three bandits were actually colluded with by Xu Fengshan and the head of the judicial section of his bureau, Chen Guozhen, and released. Later, when I returned to my hometown for something, the authorities investigated me and inquired about the number of bandits I captured. I told them everything. Then, because Xu was a public official who dared to accept bribes and release bandits, the authorities sent personnel to apply to transfer the entire case to the Shanghai District Court for thorough investigation. After a hearing, Chen Guozhen was detained and scheduled to be sentenced next month. Xu and I were both released on bail. After Xu Fengshan left the court, he said that we were from the same family and yet I acted in a petty way. So, he held a deep grudge against me. At around 8:00 PM tonight, he feigned an invitation for me to have dinner at his house. I went to his house without suspicion. Unexpectedly, he had gathered many people to tie me up with a huge rope and hang me up, brutally whipping me until my skin was broken and my body was covered with wounds to vent his anger. Before long, they untied me and locked me upstairs, ordering his wife, Zhou, to watch me. Fearing that I would be killed, I pretended to be thirsty. When she went downstairs to get tea, I jumped from the window to the drying platform and jumped into the street and ran away, which was discovered and chased after. Because the case was important, the director ordered that a document be submitted to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>
<p>Husband Has Not Returned for Ten Years</p>
<h3 id="e115">An Aunt and Uncle Again Cruelly Abuse <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Zhu Ruixian Unable to Endure Abuse</p>
<p>Her Mother Files a Lawsuit</p>
<p>Evidence Includes Bloodstained Clothing from the Beatings</p>
<p>A Hospital Also Provided a Medical Certificate</p>
<p>Zhu Ruixian, a 37-year-old obstetrics assistant at the Shanghai Hospital at the Santai Wharf in the Nanshi District, married Qin Lvzhou, the son of Qin Jieshun, who resided in Zhongda Bridge East, Chenxing Township, Shanghai County, in 1919. Qin Jieshun is the younger brother of Qin Yanqi, who currently works at the Shanghai County Property Department. After Qin and Zhu married, they lived together for a year, after which her husband went to Southeast Asia to teach. Ten years have passed without him returning home once. Zhu Ruixian has been working at the Shanghai Hospital for many years. On January 16th of this year, it was her husband's uncle's daughter's wedding, so she went to offer her congratulations. After returning home, she was severely beaten by her aunt, resulting in injuries. She was treated at Nanyang Hospital near Xiaonanmen for many days before recovering. Recently, Zhu Ruixian, unable to endure the abuse, had her birth mother, Zhu Zhao, hire lawyer Wu Luping to file a complaint with the local court, accusing Qin Jieshun and Qin Shen of assaulting and injuring her daughter. The complaint stated: "The plaintiff's daughter married the defendant's eldest son, Lvzhou, in the winter of 1919 and lived together for over a year. Lvzhou then went to Southeast Asia and has not returned for ten years. She has been frequently abused by her aunt. On January 16th of this year, Qin Zhu Ruixian's husband's uncle, Qin Yanqi, had his daughter's wedding, and she went to his house to offer her congratulations. When she returned home that night, she was refused entry. The next afternoon at 3 pm when she returned, all the doors were locked. After entering the main gate, the gate was closed, and the defendants violently beat the plaintiff's daughter, causing injuries all over her body. She cried for help, and someone intervened, preventing her from being beaten to death. Qin Xingping, the head of the Qin clan, and Shen Yinshu, the marriage introducer, can testify. In addition to the certificate issued by Nanyang Hospital, this special complaint requests that the court examine the injuries, immediately arrest the defendants, investigate the case, and prosecute them according to the law." After receiving the complaint, the local court had prosecutor Zhao open an investigative hearing three times. However, the defendants did not appear, so the trial could not be finalized. This was the fourth hearing. Qin Shen did not appear, but Qin Jieshun testified that his son had gone to Southeast Asia to teach a year after marrying Zhu in 1919. Because travel was inconvenient, he had not returned for ten years. He also recommended his daughter-in-law to the Shanghai Hospital to study medicine to gain expertise. On January 17th of this year, his wife and daughter-in-law had a physical altercation, but he denied any beatings. The plaintiff stated that her daughter's husband went to Southeast Asia shortly after the marriage and has not returned. She has been frequently abused by her aunt and uncle, and the incident on January 17th was the most violent, causing injuries all over her body and requiring her to be bedridden for many days. She has a medical certificate and requests that a forensic doctor examine the injuries in court. If the injuries are confirmed, she requests that the defendants be punished according to the law to protect her daughter's life and punish the abuse of the daughter-in-law. Zhu Ruixian testified that she had been filial to her aunt and uncle after marrying into the Qin family, but the violence had caused her great pain, mainly because her aunt was a stepmother. On January 16th, she returned home from the wedding and found all the doors locked, preventing her from entering. The next afternoon at 3 pm, she returned again, and all the accessible doors were locked, allowing only exit and entry through the main gate. Upon entering, she was violently beaten by her aunt, causing injuries to her face and abdomen, as evidenced by the hospital certificate. She also had a piece of clothing stained with mud from the beating, which proves what happened at the time. The court sent a forensic doctor to examine the injuries, which were confirmed. The investigation was concluded, and the court deemed the defendants guilty and will file a public prosecution.</p>
<h3 id="e116">A Russian Criminal from Harbin Arrested in Shanghai <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Attempted to Flee to France Unsuccessfully</p>
<p>Authorized to be Handed Over to the Harbin Police</p>
<p>Harbin is a commercial center for Russians in China, with a large Russian population. Since the abolition of Russian consular jurisdiction, civil and criminal cases involving Russians in the area have been handled by the Eastern Provinces Special District Court. Recently, the court ruled in the case of Zahaov being sued by Fei Erfang for a debt of 20,000 yuan. Zahaov refused to comply with the judgment, and Fei applied for enforcement. Zahaov secretly boarded a ship, hoping to escape to France. Fei learned that the ship had already departed from Harbin and could not be stopped. He urgently requested the Harbin court to send a telegram to the Shanghai Special District Local Court and the French Concession Police to intercept the ship. The court immediately issued an arrest warrant, ordering the General Police Department to arrest Zahaov upon the ship's arrival so that the Harbin court could send personnel to take him into custody. On the 25th of this month, the ship arrived in Shanghai. A detective of Russian nationality, Bei Beining, boarded the ship to investigate and arrest him. Zahaov suddenly claimed that he was a citizen of France and not subject to the jurisdiction of the Chinese court, showing a passport issued by the French consulate in Harbin. The detective did not dare to act rashly and went to the French consulate to investigate. However, it was a Sunday, and the French Consul General, Peina Te, was not present. Fearing that the ship might depart immediately and allow the escape, the French police received a telegram from Harbin and dispatched detectives to arrest Zahaov. The next day, the French consular authorities telegraphed the French Embassy in Beijing and the French Consulate in Harbin for detailed investigation of Zahaov's nationality. Confirmation was received that Zahaov was indeed a Russian citizen. The Harbin court also sent a police officer with official documents to Shanghai to take him into custody. The French police handed Zahaov over to the General Police Department. Yesterday morning, he was brought to the Special District Local Court, where Judge Xu Jia Shi presided over the trial. Wang Yaotang, a lawyer from the Police Department, explained the case and requested the court to decide on the matter of extradition. Judge Xu then questioned the defendant about the debt dispute and ruled that he should be handed over to the police to be taken back for investigation.</p>

<p>Li Xia, a Ningbo native who lived at 93 Huai'an Lane, Baike Road, and worked as a private prostitute, abused her nine-year-old niece, Li Aidi, by severely beating her. Late at night, she abandoned the girl in a remote alley on Baoshan Road. A patrol officer discovered the girl and notified the relevant police station, who arrested the woman and brought her to the Special District Local Court for questioning. The details were reported previously. Yesterday morning, Judge Ge Zhitan held a continued hearing. Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer from the Police Department, stated that the defendant's actions were extremely cruel and intolerable by law and humanity, and requested that she be severely punished according to the law. Judge Ge then questioned the woman about the abuse. Finding her guilty of causing injury, he sentenced her to two years and six months of imprisonment. He also sentenced her to two years and six months of imprisonment for abandoning a person who was helpless and in need of assistance, care, and protection. The two sentences were to be served concurrently for a total of three years. A wooden stick was confiscated. Li Aidi was sent to a welfare institution.</p>

<p>Visiting His Cousin Led to His Death</p>
<p>Telegraphing Family Members to Collect the Body</p>
<p>Recently, there have been frequent incidents of people being injured by trains between the Chizhi College and the Law School on Jiangwan Road. The night before last (the 28th), at around 11 PM, another person died under the wheels of a train. The deceased was Xiong Yimin, a 40-year-old from Funing, Jiangsu. His cousin, Qingyun, is also a student at the Shanghai Law School. Xiong had come to Shanghai from Ningbo to discuss business and was temporarily staying at No. 1 Gejia Zui. That morning, he went to the Law School to meet his cousin. He started to return to his residence around 11 PM that evening, but unexpectedly, he was crushed to death by the last train coming from the North Station while crossing the tracks. His body was severed in two, his internal organs exposed, a truly tragic sight. The chief of the fifth branch of Tan Jia Qiao Police Station and the local headman immediately moved his body to the side of the railway. Yesterday morning, his cousin telegraphed his brother in his hometown and prepared a coffin to temporarily store his body at the Jianghuai Guild Hall. It is said that the deceased had two sons and one daughter, and the entire family depended on him for support.</p>

<p>Her Affection for Her Husband Transferred</p>
<p>A Divorce Lawsuit Has Been Filed</p>
<p>Wu A'di, from Suzhou, married Zou Xiuying in his hometown seven years ago. They have a three-year-old daughter. Due to poverty, they came to Shanghai to seek a livelihood. Through relatives and friends, Wu was recommended to work as a helper in a brothel on Guangxi Road, and Zou became a room attendant. The woman was young and beautiful, and she was good at understanding people's intentions. She was very popular with the patrons, who showered her with generous tips. The woman's affection for her husband gradually diminished, and she clearly expressed her unwillingness to be married to Wu. She hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the Special District Local Court, accusing Wu of being addicted to gambling, even mortgaging her clothes. When she tried to dissuade him, she was abused. She claimed that it was unbearable to live together and requested a divorce. She also asked for 20,000 yuan in alimony and that their daughter remain in her custody. Yesterday morning, Judge Xu Wenrong of the Civil Court of the Special Court summoned the plaintiff, but she was unable to attend due to illness. Wu A'di hired Ye Moukang to appear in court and argue against the divorce. After a brief questioning by Judge Xu, he ordered the case to be adjourned for another hearing.</p>

<h3 id="e120">The 10th Anniversary of the Exchange Postponed <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Securities and Commodities Exchange originally planned to hold its 10th-anniversary celebration at Bansong Garden in South Shanghai on July 1st. In the past week, participation from all sectors has been enthusiastic. The colleagues at the exchange were deeply grateful. However, due to the increasingly hot weather and the fact that Bansong Garden is far away in South Shanghai, making it inconvenient for guests to travel, it was decided to postpone the celebration temporarily. Once the weather cools down, a date will be set for a supplementary celebration. All performing arts groups that have already registered will be retained, and they will be invited to perform again when the date is set.</p>
<h3 id="e121">A New Tool for Sending and Receiving Secret Messages <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Hu's Secret Code Machine is Released</p>
<p>Available for Consignment Sale at Commercial Press Branches</p>
<p>Sending secret messages has relied on codebooks, which require the sender and receiver to compile and copy a book, which is time-consuming and prone to loss and leakage. The invention of Hu's Secret Code Machine makes up for these shortcomings. The machine has simple parts, convenient translation, and saves more than half the time compared to the old method. Its structure uses rotating wheels for infinite changes. Having one machine allows communication with thousands of locations, ensuring absolute secrecy and preventing investigation. It has been registered with the government and granted a patent, and it is divided into three types: the No. 1 four-wheel numerical machine can translate and send Chinese secret messages; the No. 2 five-wheel numerical machine can also send five-digit Western secret messages; and the No. 3 five-wheel Western character machine is specially for sending Western secret messages. The machines are sold at low prices, and branches of the Commercial Press in Shanghai and elsewhere consign them for sale.</p>

<h3 id="e122">Lawyer Yan Sends Letter Requesting Speedy Settlement <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The creditor's meeting of Day and Night Bank and the Great World Deposit and Tour Department previously commissioned Lawyer Yan Luqing to legally pursue the case. It has been four months, and the money has not yet been returned. The creditors are very anxious to receive their deposits for use before the end of May, so they have again commissioned Lawyer Yan to send a letter to accountants Wu and Pan, urging them to actively carry out the liquidation and make a partial distribution as soon as possible. The letter is recorded below: "To the Accountants: The liquidation of Day and Night Bank and other companies has been going on for four months, and the money has not yet been returned. The deadline for settlement at the end of May is approaching, and most of the creditors are poor people who urgently need their deposits. If we do not seek prompt settlement or a partial distribution, how can we appease the anxious hopes of the thousands of creditors? Therefore, at the second meeting of the creditors' representatives of the Gongfa Company on the 21st of this month, I proposed to find a way to make a partial distribution as soon as possible, and the accountants agreed to try. Now that the first accounting period of this year has arrived, and the creditors who have come to urge payment are even more numerous than before. Therefore, I am sending this letter specifically to ask you to pay attention and actively carry out the liquidation, and to make a partial distribution as soon as possible to ease the anxiety of the creditors. I would be very grateful."</p>

<p>Unequal Treatment Between Chinese and Foreign Employees</p>
<p>More than 100 employees and 560 workers of the British-owned Shanghai Gas Company on Xizang Road in the Public Concession have recently demanded a wage increase due to high prices and the difficulty of living. Representatives such as Wang Xigui have contacted and negotiated with the company's management, Pike, three times. Pike replied the day before yesterday that the company's business situation has been affected by the high price of gold and the low price of silver, resulting in monthly losses. Therefore, there is no way to increase wages. It is currently planned to reduce the scope and change personnel, resulting in no results. It is said that the company's salary regulations for Westerners are based on the price of gold, so the higher the price of gold, the higher the monthly wages. This unequal treatment is unfair. Yesterday afternoon at 6 PM, employees and workers convened a joint meeting of the working group leaders and directors in the union, deciding to push Yao Liankun, Wang Xigui, and others as representatives to make a final consultation with the company management.</p>

Zhang was less than half a step behind Duan, which caused her to lose the chance to compete in the 50-meter final. It is said that Zhang Suhui cried bitterly afterward, truly resembling Liu Bei's lament for his lost kingdom. However, her desire for honor and unwillingness to fall behind others is commendable.

<p>**Poor Publicity by the Organizing Committee**</p>
<p>The organizing committee did not announce the standings and times for each group in the preliminary rounds, only announcing the qualifiers for the finals. Reporters had to inquire with the designated publicity department to obtain this information. Even the publicity department was unclear about the details, indicating poor management. Besides the records mentioned earlier, another incident occurred after the women's 200-meter relay race. The referee did not announce the results and left with the score sheet to have a meal. Afterwards, the score sheet disappeared without a trace. The record-keeping department and publicity department searched everywhere but could not find it, leaving the audience unable to see the full picture, which was truly regrettable.</p>

<p>Group A: Cheng Lie First; Group B: Soochow; Group C: Suzhou Middle School.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Various Preparations Before the Start of the Suzhou Provincial Record Race <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>There were 181 participants in the All-Suzhou Games, including members of the Red Lion Sports Association of Soochow University, Cheng Lie Vocational School, Suzhou Middle School, Taowu, Cuiying, Yan Cheng, Soochow Middle School, County Middle School, and individual participants. Universities were classified as Group A, middle schools as Group B, and junior high schools as Group C. After a long period of preparation, the games began under the scorching sun at 1:00 PM yesterday at the Taowu Field. The military music seemed to indicate a good outcome for the games. Before the opening ceremony, a staff meeting was held to decide that the number of students participating in Group C under individual provincial names would not be included in the team score. In individual competitions, if an individual won the championship, the second-place finisher would be promoted. However, Group A retained its open nature, and individual and team scores were not separated.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Roll Call of the Games <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Three to four thousand guests were present, with 50-60% concentrated at the finish line of the track events. Many spectators occupied the high ground along the city wall. Spectators paid more attention to Group B than Group A or C, as Group B had many talented athletes. These included Cheng Jinkuan, a top athlete from the Ten Middle Schools, and Jiang Xianglin, the provincial track and field champion. Both the veteran Lu Yaxiong and the new forces were equally strong. However, Lu Yaxiong could not participate due to a foot injury. Cheng Jinkuan was called back to Shanghai due to an emergency at home but managed to return yesterday morning, fortunately not failing his mission. Based on the team scores, Cheng Lie was likely to win Group A, while Suzhou Middle School was unlikely to win Group B. Yan Cheng had a higher chance of winning. There were many new talents in Group C, making it difficult to predict the outcome.</p>

The results of the Group B and C preliminary rounds showed that Cheng Jinkuan ran the 100 meters in 11.8 seconds, while Li Kaiqing ran it in 11.6 seconds, indicating an exciting final round today. Wei Dayu ran the 200 meters in Group C in just 25.5 seconds, showing great potential. Today's races in Group B are expected to break many provincial records and come close to national records.</p>

<p>Zhuang Mingzhen, a female student from Cheng Lie, surprised everyone. Her high jump and 50-meter race both broke the national record, bringing honor to the cultured city of Suzhou. The first Suzhou Men's Track and Field Meet was held yesterday for two consecutive days. The events of the first day are described in detail below.</p>

<p>**Group B Two Provincial Records**</p>
<p>The results of the 100-meter and 3,000-meter finals in Group A were acceptable, but the 400-meter and 800-meter races in Group B broke this year's provincial records, making the spectators ten times more excited. Miss Zhuang Mingzhen, a female athlete from Suzhou, was also cheering on the sidelines. It was a pity that Lu Yaxiong could not participate, otherwise the long jump record would not have remained unbroken.</p>

<p>**Ministry of Education Issues Regulations on Assessing County and City Mayors' Administration of Education**</p>
<p>The Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Education have issued provisional regulations to the civil and education departments of various provinces regarding the assessment of county and city mayors' administration of education.</p>
<p>The circular states that the development of education in various regions depends entirely on the seriousness of the county and city mayors.</p>
<p>Currently, many mayors are enthusiastic and proactive in promoting education, but there are also those who treat it as a mere formality and fail to implement it effectively. If there are no specific assessment regulations to reward and punish accordingly, those who have contributed cannot be encouraged, and those who are derelict in their duties cannot be held accountable. This greatly impacts the efficiency of educational administration. Therefore, provisional regulations have been jointly drafted for assessing county and city mayors' administration of education, which have been submitted for approval and communicated to the Examination Yuan for record-keeping. In the future, the assessment of county and city mayors' administration of education will be conducted in accordance with these regulations. In addition to separate orders, the regulations are being distributed for strict compliance and communication to the affiliated county and city mayors.</p>

They were introduced to each other, and Mr. Liu's history was reported. All participants praised him highly.

<h3 id="e169">First American Art Exhibition in the Capital <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>By Wang Yachen</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Education organized the National Art Exhibition in Shanghai in the spring of 1929, it has not been reopened. To promote cultural undertakings by organizing art exhibitions should not be a one-time occurrence but should be held regularly every year. If it is only held when there is funding or when it is not too troublesome, its effectiveness in promoting domestic cultural undertakings is minimal and equals zero. The Nanjing Municipal Government and the Municipal Bureau of Education recently felt the need to promote culture in the capital. After five months of preparation, the first art exhibition was held in Nanjing on the 19th of this month. A month ago, Director Zhang Zhongdao of the Nanjing Municipal Bureau of Education came to Shanghai to contact Li Zuhan for Chinese paintings and Yu Gongtong for Western paintings and sculptures to jointly solicit exhibits from Shanghai. I arrived in Beijing on the morning of the 19th to participate in the opening ceremony as an examiner. A reception for guests was held in the auditorium of the Municipal Government on that day. Representatives from the Central Party Headquarters, the Ministry of Education, the Municipal Party Headquarters, and various agencies attended. In the morning, the Director of the Bureau of Education accompanied the guests to view the exhibits. The following is a brief description of the venue and the contents of the exhibits.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Arrangement of the Venue <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>The Confucius Temple in Nanjing is located on the banks of the Qinhuai River and has historically been a gathering place for the people. Its prosperity is similar to the City God Temple in Shanghai and the Xuanmiao Temple in Suzhou. This type of venue is not suitable for holding art exhibitions. However, the Nanjing Municipal Government spent 5,000 gold coins to renovate the interior and exterior, making it brand new. After the Municipal Government implemented regulations to eliminate miscellaneous items and stalls in front of the temple, these people were no longer seen. Recently, gardens have been set up, and the Confucius Temple has been used as a public library and lecture hall, which is a good deed. Since the opening, national and party flags have been hung from the front of the door to the center of the street, fluttering in the wind. The entrance is set up with a signature area. The two sides of the temple and the Dacheng Hall in the center all display works, allowing viewers to exit from right to left. The more than ten rooms on the right side of the corridor display Western paintings, sculptures, and photography. The left side displays Chinese paintings and embroidery. The Dacheng Hall displays ancient artifacts for reference.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Contents of the Exhibits <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>The exhibits are limited to Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, especially Nanjing and Shanghai. The total number of exhibits is over 2,000 items. Due to insufficient display space, they must be rotated three times, changing every three days. The most numerous exhibits are modern paintings, followed by Western paintings. There are about a hundred sculptures, photographs, and embroidery items. Although there is a review of all the results, each department is not strict, and there are no regulations or restrictions on the installation. This type of shortcoming is unavoidable in the first exhibition. If there is a precise organization in the future, it can be improved.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Valuable Artifacts for Reference <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>The valuable artifacts for reference are no less than those of the 18th National Exhibition. The first batch of exhibits includes a sword with Xia Dynasty patterns. The sword is made of bronze and engraved with the head, heart, and hand. The carving is exquisite, and the color is deep purple with a shimmering glow. It is truly a rare treasure. The Han Dynasty Wu Family Stone Chamber portrait depicts people with discernible clothing folds. The Tang Dynasty Wang Youcheng's Four Seasons Landscape, the Tang Dynasty Han Qiu's Buddhist Kingdom, and the Ming Dynasty Xue Zhuang Monk's landscape album are all rare pieces. The Song Dynasty Sima Guang Yan Chi Yan is not very large, but all the colors are present and cannot be compared to ordinary Yan. Yu Zhi's copy of Tang Wu Daozi's Heavenly King Sending Son is so skilled and the lines are so beautiful that it cannot be replicated by modern people. The most valuable rubbings include the Song Dynasty rubbing of the Bigan Stele, the Song Chunhua Famous Ministers Calligraphy, and the Tang Dynasty Seventeen Letters. Other calligraphy and paintings from the Ming and Qing Dynasties are not described in detail. It is said that the collections of Mr. Dai Jitao, Xu Shiying, and Ha Shaofu will be added during the second batch of exchanges. The country lacks art museum organizations, so this exhibition provides a good opportunity for viewers.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Dog Exhibition in the Shadow of Rose <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>By Ms. Ye Hua</p>
<p>The Chinese Kennel Club is organized by Chinese and Western people and holds a dog show every year at the end of the azalea season. This is the sixth exhibition. On the 16th day of June, the club held a dog exhibition at the Shanghai Racecourse. I and Dr. Fei Kunnian and his wife brought our dogs to participate. Entering the venue from No. 14 Ma Huo Road, the entrance fee was one yuan for the general public and half price for children. Uniformed personnel were charged two cents. Western boy scouts were invited to carry the special edition of the dog exhibition, and the guests were warmly welcomed. Many Western women were dressed elegantly and luxuriously.</p>
<p>The club's emblem, a red, white, and blue cloth banner, was hung around the venue, creating a dazzling effect. On both sides of the entrance, two or three pharmacies displayed dog medicine and dog food, generously giving away exquisite dog breeding guides and soap samples. Foreign merchants did not spare any expense on advertising, which further enhanced the atmosphere. The center of the venue was the judging area. Chinese and Western judges inspected, criticized, and awarded blue, red, green, and white ribbons. The winners also received silver cups. The dog kennels were made of reed mats and surrounded the judging area. The dog beds were four or five feet above the ground, and the ground was covered with sand to maintain hygiene. There were nearly 300 dogs participating in the exhibition, each marked with a number. The registration fee was two yuan per dog or per pair. Most of the dog owners were Westerners, especially women. Only a few Chinese participated. There were only three women. It is estimated that there are 3.5 million dogs in England and 5.4 million in the United States, averaging one dog for every six people. China is far behind. This is due to the instability of society and the weakness of the national economy.</p>
<p>European and American dog shows are often divided into more than ten groups. The club only has six categories, five of which are the same as last year. This year, a new obedience category has been added. The so-called obedient dogs have received considerable training and can come, go, lie down, stand, follow, jump, bark, and refuse food from others. They only obey the master's orders. A friend had a police dog named Xue Tao, which was extremely alert. It once disarmed a bodyguard of Madame Soong Mei-ling and refused her entry. It had attended this exhibition last year but is now dead. Recalling the past, I cannot help but feel ("The years are similar, but the dogs are different each year.")</p>
<p>Dog shows in the West have a long history, dating back to the 17th century. China has only had these organizations in recent years. The current exhibition features less than 30 dog breeds, which is a sign of the decline of dog shows. The most popular breeds among the 30 are toy dogs and foxhounds. The most valuable is Cheng Yize's police dog. Cheng is an enthusiastic dog breeder and is a leader among the Chinese. The establishment of the China Double Yuan Police Dog Institute relies heavily on Cheng's efforts. He has repeatedly taken champion police dogs from various countries to Western dog shows. This day, he added an exhibition for people to enjoy. The viewers were all envious.</p>

<p>By Huang Yanpei</p>
<p>Fifteen years ago, there was a very regrettable event in Chinese culture, which must be blamed on the military authorities in Beijing at that time for their lack of common sense. Dr. G.E. Morrison, an Australian from British Australia, began working as a correspondent for the London Times in Beijing in 1897. He traveled to almost all the provinces of China and, after 20 years of experience, became an expert on China. In the early years of the Republic of China, he even served as an advisor to the Presidential Office. He had a grand vision to collect ancient and modern books and documents written in European languages on the problems of the Far East. Through his continuous efforts, he made an unprecedented contribution. This is what is called the Morrison Library.</p>
<p>The library contains more than 24,000 books of various sizes, more than 1,000 maps and pictures, and more than 110 periodicals. The languages used include English, French, German, Russian, Dutch, Italian, Latin, Spanish, Portuguese, Swedish, Danish, Polish, Hungarian, Greek, and Finnish. The Far Eastern countries covered include China, Korea, Japan, Manchuria, Mongolia, Siberia, Xinjiang, Russian Asia, Tibet, Indochina Peninsula, East Indies, and the Philippine Islands, with China as the center. The types of books and documents include politics, diplomacy, law, economics, military affairs, literature, art, academics, religion, customs, history, geography, geology, minerals, animals, plants, medicine, health, games, entertainment, and various other topics.</p>
<p>During the Boxer Rebellion, Morrison's residence was burned to the ground. Fortunately, the library had been moved to Prince Su's residence a few hours earlier. Later, Morrison's residence and library were moved to Wangfujing Street, allowing scholars to view the Morrison Library, which became famous. In the fourth or fifth year of the Republic of China, Morrison suddenly felt compelled to sell the library. Harvard University, Yale University, the University of California, and American Minister Ren Xia were all competing to buy it. In the end, it was acquired by Baron Iwasaki of Japan for only 35,000 British pounds. It was as if the Chinese government did not know that there was such a thing as China. It was as if no one knew that there was enough financial power to buy it.</p>
<p>It did not matter if they did not know. On August 29th, the sixth year of the Republic of China, Iwasaki's representative went to Beijing to receive the library. It was transported by rail to Tanggu and then by the postal ship Takasagomaru to Yokohama. When it was transported out of Beijing, the Beijing government even sent police to protect it, as if they were happily sending him out of the country.</p>
<p>Morrison had three conditions for selling the library to Iwasaki: 1. It must be permanently preserved in one place and not dispersed. 2. The name "Dr. Morrison Library" must be retained. 3. If it is used as part of a larger library with the same purpose, it must still be accessible to scholars.</p>
<p>What about now? The Morrison Library has been expanded into the Toyo Bunko and a building has been built in Komagome Kami-Fujimae-cho, Tokyo. When the Great Kanto Earthquake occurred in September of the 12th year of the Taisho era, the building was not affected, which was fortunate for Eastern culture. I visited the library on April 8th and met with its director, Mr. Ishida. There were many new books and documents that had been collected, but most of them were about Japan. The former owner, Dr. Morrison, died three years after selling the library in his hometown of London in 1920.</p>

<p>My glass windows are made of two layers with a space of only one inch between them. I use the glass liner method of thermos bottles. There is a vacuum in the middle that does not conduct heat, so the outside heat in the summer will not be conducted in. Moreover, the louvers can let in the wind. Some of the glass windows are also made of louvers. My houseboat is square and does not have a fixed direction. The beauty of my magnesium wall is that it is specially used to block the scorching sun or the slanted wind and rain. Because magnesium is not heat-conductive and is not afraid of water or fire.

<p>An overview of the track and field finals has been published in this newspaper. Additional reports are provided below.</p>
<h3 id="e218">Liaoning Sweeps the 1500 Meters <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>1500 meters: First place, Zhang Baoxiang (Liaoning); second place, Liu Guxue (Liaoning); third place, Ma Degang (Liaoning); fourth place, Jiang Yunlong (Liaoning). The time was 4 minutes 21.4 seconds. The first two finishers broke the previous national record of 4 minutes 23 seconds held by Jiang Yunlong from the previous games. When it was reported that all four finishers were from Liaoning, the audience cheered and applauded. Liaoning has a wealth of strong athletes.</p>
<h3 id="e219">Zhang Lingjia Takes Second in Discus <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>Discus: First place, Zhou Lianzeng (Liaoning); second place, Zhang Lingjia (Liaoning); third place, Yang Xuexian (Shandong); fourth place, Zhao Wenzao (Beiping). The distance was 36.50 meters. The top two finishers broke the national record. The previous national record was 34.63 meters held by Zhang Lingjia. This time, Zhang Lingjia finished second, surpassed by Zhou Lianzeng. However, his distance of 35.49 meters was significantly better than his previous record.</p>
<h3 id="e220">Decline in Long Jump Performance <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>Long jump: First place, Fu Baorui (Liaoning); second place, Liang Yan (Tianjin); third place, Pan Zuoxin (Beiping); fourth place, Yao Dingwei (Beiping). The distance was 6.38 meters, a significant decline from the previous games. The previous North China and national records were both 6.74 meters. Pan Zuoxin did not perform as well as in the past and finished third, reportedly due to a back injury and lack of practice.</p>
<h3 id="e221">Athlete Oath <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<h3 id="e222">Wang Mingshen Leads from Start to Finish in the 800 Meters <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>800 meters: First place, Wang Mingshen (Harbin); second place, Zhang Baoxiang (Liaoning); third place, Jiang Yunlong (Liaoning); fourth place, Fan Baoen (Beiping). The time was 2 minutes 6.8 seconds. The top three finishers broke the national record. The previous national and North China records were both 2 minutes 9 seconds, with the national record held by Wang Xuanji and Deng Zhiming, and the North China record held by Wang Xuanji alone. This time, Wang Mingshen's time was 2 seconds faster than Wang Xuanji's. Zhang Baoxiang's time was 2 minutes 6.8 seconds, and Jiang Yunlong's time was 2 minutes 8.4 seconds, also better than Wang Xuanji's. Even the fourth-place finisher, Fan Baoen, with a time of 2 minutes 9 seconds, was comparable to Wang Xuanji. Wang Mingshen led the race from the beginning, leading by 20 meters after the first lap, and maintained the lead throughout the race, ultimately winning the championship. He is a truly outstanding athlete.</p>
<h3 id="e223">Javelin Performance Worse Than Last Year <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>Javelin: First place, Zhao Wenzao (Beiping); second place, Guo Jingsheng (Harbin); third place, Liang Dezhang (Liaoning); fourth place, Chen Shengkui (Beiping). The distance was 43.98 meters, worse than the previous North China record of 45.70 meters held by Yin Shangping and the national record of 45.90 meters held by Wen Dingxin.</p>
