<p>本屆各國之議會。雖因世界商業之衰落。經濟之困難。各國政府之反對黨。初咸盡力以攻擊政府。政府黨對之幾有岌岌可危之勢。迨至今日。各國議會之政爭時期。行將結束。而各國政府之重要議案。亦能通過。政府難關。逐漸過去。各國反對黨之倒閣運動。多至失望。此其故。蓋由於世界各國。處於今日困難之地位爲大勢所成。非一國一黨之力所可左右。此其情形。咸爲其國人所能原諒。苟變易政府。非特不能救濟其艱難。反恐益增其紛擾此其一。再則各國之反對黨。大抵由於前次執政失败而來。其主義政策。視今之執政者。更屬於守舊之方面。故無論若何攻擊現在之執政。而一般之國民不能信任。此其二因此二故。試觀今日之英。保守黨不能勝工黨而代。今日之日本。政友會不能勝國民黨而代之。其外若德。雖經兩極端黨之左右攻擊。而卒能安然度過一切難關。且德奥税約之成功。而博全國之歡譽。此中情狀。蓋深可思矣。</p>

<p>吾國行省制度丶始自元代丶初非有何深意丶不過圖軍事之便利丶爲臨時之設置而已丶明清因之丶民國肇建丶又仍其舊丶沿訛龔謬丶冗腫疏闊丶時人論之甚詳丶此誠吾國行政制度上重要問題也丶方今軍事敉平丶訓政伊始丶欲求增進行政效率丶非將省區重行審定丶縮小區域不可丶謹將理由臚陳如下丶</p>
<p>一曰幅幀遼闊　吾國省區之大丶世界莫與比倫丶河北一省大於英格蘭威爾斯之和丶四川一省丶大於日本三島丶比較面積甚小之浙江省丶尙大於比利時荷蘭兩國丶甚至一縣疆域丶有大於歐洲或中南美洲之一國者丶鞭長莫及丶治理粗疏丶省政府雖有指揮監督之權丶夷考其實丶發號施令丶徒恃一紙空文丶通行各縣丶各縣之是否奉行丶不得而知为奉行之成績若何丶更不得而考丶乃至地方利弊丶經濟衰窳丶更茫然罔覺丶在省府則患指揮不靈丶在各縣則感下情不能上達丶是故自治教育實業交通種種要政丶雖有良好計畫丶而末由實施丶此省區不能不縮小者一也丶</p>
<p>二曰交通梗塞　吾國文化雖甚古丶而物質文明發達則甚遲丶以交通言之丶除東北東南數省丶略有鐵路可通丶或兼擅舟楫之利外丶二十八行省及蒙古西藏丶鐵路寥寥可數丶西北如甘肅青海寗夏丶西南如四川西康貴州廣西丶尙無一尺鐵路丶河川亦少丶蒙藏更等自鄶丶其交通工具丶惟恃古代相沿之騾車駱駝子肩輿民船丶重以幅幀闊山嶺多之故丶自縣至鄉丶有須四五日或十日者丶自省至縣丶有經月始達者丶政府縱有勵精圖治之决心丶事實决無使臂使指之效力丶較之並世文明諸國丶政令急於置郵丶交通多朝發夕至者丶奚啻天淵丶此省區不能不縮小者二也丶</p>
<p>三曰情勢各别　一省之中丶言語不通为嗜欲不同丶風俗殊趨丶利害異致丶經濟懸絶丶同一省也丶東西南北丶利害背馳丶故省政府施政斠若畫一丶則興祁寒暑雨之嗟丶因地制宜丶又感削足適履之苦丶此省區不能不縮小者三也丶</p>
<p>四曰畛域太深　吾國人畛域之見为深入腦筋丶省界亦其一端丶民國以來丶此風未改丶機關易一長吏丶同鄉多慶彈冠丶省籍偶有不同丶賢才亦遭擯斥丶不獨政治爲然丶商業上社會上亦多此疆彼界丶劃若鴻溝丶論者謂吾國人聰明才力不遜西人丶祇乏合作之精神丶遂减辦事之效率丶推原其缺乏合作精神之故丶未嘗非省界爲之因丶此省區不能不縮小者四也丶</p>
<p>五曰軍人割據　幅幀遼闊丶交通梗塞丶旣如上述矣丶不幸而野心家起丶手握兵權丶蟠居省會丶一省之兵力財賦丶旣等於世界之一國丶故可與中央抗衡丶中央之權威失其控馭丶二十年來武人割據内亂循環丶陷人民於水深火熱之中丶而爲國民革命之絶大障礙者丶未或不由於此丶病定思痛丶實有改絃更張之必要丶此省區不能不縮小者五也丶</p>
<p>以上所舉理由丶前四者爲夙疾丶後一者爲新疴丶前四者病在麻木不仁丶後一者病在心腹之患丶要之夙疾新疴丶麻木不仁丶心腹之患丶胥有待於治療則一丶樞之愚見丶以爲縮小省區丶乃對症之良方也丶昔法國患幅員太大丶治理難周丶畛域太深丶軍人割據丶與我國今日情勢大略從同丶乃於大革命時毅然廢四十省丶改爲八十七州丶由是治理精密丶脈絡貫通丶相沿至今丶百廢具舉丶本黨爲革命建國之唯一政黨丶今日爲訓政實施之發軔時期丶本數十年奮鬥之精神丶謀政區之改革丶欲中央與各省能均權丶欲地方實行自治丶舍此别無他道丶其辦法則將行省區域縮小丶每省分爲二三丶審察山川形勢丶交通便塞丶財政赢絀为人口疏密丶經濟豐嗇丶以爲劃分之準丶務使調劑得宜丶號令敏捷丶截長補短丶無或偏枯丶庶足以應時勢之要求丶而策政治之改善丶抑更有進者丶國家政務紛然雜陳丶若者宜於集權中央丶若者宜於分權各省丶若者宜於中央及各省兼治合作丶吾國中央地方權限不分丶爲政象一大病丶兩者之間丶時或發生齟齬丶或互相推諉丶齟齬推諉丶厥弊維均丶政務廢弛丶胥此之由丶或謂此種權限之劃分丶爲將來憲法上一重要問題丶枝節更張丶無有是處丶不知憲法與非憲法之别丶不在中央地方權限之是否劃分丶而在其劃分之固定與否丶載之憲法丶則有强固性丶如或修正丶須經嚴重之手續丶不載之憲法丶則有流動性丶可斟酌時勢及政象丶隨時修正而已丶是亦宜與省區縮小案同時規定者也丶謹附帶説明如右丶伍朝樞丶</p>

<p>向犯人家屬索詐</p>
<p>無欵則拐賣其妻</p>

<p>先逮蔣正根　宜興縣公安局警察隊隊長王耀武丶前以蔣正根（又名王廷海）在宜興犯有强盜案丶被當地官廳嚴緝後丶潛逃來滬丶故會同匯可捕房將蔣拘解特區地方法院丶當因王隊長未提出移提公文丶未便遽將人犯交給帶去丶歸案訊辦丶諭暫將蔣覊押丶候宜興縣政府來文再核丶王即返宜報告丶經縣長給以公文丶仍行來滬丶</p>

<p>昨晚第三次决賽····三八比二七勝中華</p>
<p>不幸哉本屆萬國籃球賽之中華隊也、蓋自第一次失望之後、第二次即戰勝强美虎口餘生、奪得昨晚在中華籃球房第三次决賽之均等機會、於是人多以爲本屆之中華隊不難爭著祖鞭擊敗美國、保住Ａ·Ｂ·Ｃ·盃又一年矣、孰知不如意事、十居八九、最後一幕、竟爲美國以三十八比二十七占勝、遂攫本屆錦標而去、Ａ·Ｂ·Ｃ·銀盃又屬該隊本屆第一年之陳列品矣、</p>
<p>勝敗難逃公例</p>
<p>美國獲得最後之勝利是有其過人之處、絶無僥倖可言、彼史奎亞者籃球界之人傑、美國隊之重心、一旦披甲出戰、出其旋乾轉坤之技、引導全隊、直趨光明路上、達到成功之域、説可謂羣雄之龍、智勇超衆也、畢雪潑氏、麥令斯之柱石、昨晚戰來、出神入化、得分之多、幾占全隊之半、匹雷漢恩士二人、力盡蹶職、無暇可擊、獨史密斯失其常態、不及往昔之可顧、</p>
<p>好壞是有公論</p>
<p>中華隊之表演、前後不同、最初之十分鐘内、恍如疾雷迅電、天地失色、鋭氣之盛、駕諸美國之上、陸鍾思因係此中主腦、其餘四將之技能、亦能盡量發展、良辰不再、好景不常、俄頃之間、形勢漸惡、整旅重戰、依然欠佳、於是前鋒活動减色第衛防衛失策、最後赴湯蹈火、死中求活、無奈大勢已去、挽求乏衛、雙方終以後備應敵、爲閉幕前之點綴矣、</p>
<p>乘風破萬里浪</p>
<p>七時登塲交鋒、中央拍球、陸鍾思隨手奪來、急傳與魏海青、魏伏籃下、躊躇失策、孔廣益遠投失鵠、魏海青帶罪立功、首開紀錄、敵軍失膽、美隊反撲、五路並進、漢恩士士身先士卒、陳祥龍起而阻之、犯規受罰、漢恩士一一命中、成二比二、梁國權籃下仰攻、魏海青騰空躍入、兩球已得、聲勢大壯、乘風破萬里浪、慨然有澄清天下之壯志矣、</p>
<p>一波掀動萬頃</p>
<p>中華八分鐘之奮鬥、造成轟動一時之紀錄、乃一波掀動萬頃、星火竟能燎原、前鋒順利、後衛隨進、内部空虚、敵軍侵入、史　亞立功、漢恩士　之、二隊分數、遂至相等、彼時互告奮勇、作戰劇烈、美國史密斯畢雪潑之二球、猶如飛將軍破空而下、出人意外、從此美國扶搖直上、中華望塵莫及矣、上半時美國二十一分中華十四分、</p>
<p>心有餘力不足</p>
<p>休息時内、中華智多星錦鴻密授策略、再戰聲起、三四傳遞、魏海青登堂入室、一投成功、捷音傳來四座大震、或以佳兆一得、不難重握覇權、不料白駒過隙、美景頓易敵軍好整以暇、每出必獲、中華心有餘力不足、重山疊嶺、寸步難行、勝負之勢已定、各以後備應戰、結果美國以三十八比二十七勝中華、總三次决賽總結、美國以二對一勝中華、獲得本屆錦標、</p>

<p>— 陳元良</p>
<p>詩人樊樊山氏。自去秋臥病舊都。久久弗愈。愛好文藝者。常深繫念。冀其早占勿藥。再貢珠璣。孰意噩耗傳來。竟於三月十四夜九點三十分以中風逝世。海内文人。當爲之惋惜不置也。</p>
<p>樊爲鄂之恩施縣人。髫年即具卓越之天資。益以家學淵源。故每試輒冠其曹。從大儒李慈銘遊。得入堂奥。詩才俊逸。下筆成章。會張南皮總督該省。聞其名。招之入幕。薰陶日久。學乃益進。舉於鄉後。復擢至進士及第。旋放陜西宜川知縣。樊善辯才。片言折獄。聞者悦服。批語判詞。莊諧並茂。遐邇悉傳誦之焉。當榮祿大權獨攬時。延樊入幕。爲之運籌帷幄者若干時。迨拳匪亂作。遂隨鑾蒙難。後慈禧之罪已變法諸詔。純出其手筆。斯時樊之顯貴。已極一時。因此招嫉。而褫職他去。越年復起用。充江寗布政使。時端方總督兩江。治政之暇。每與之縱談古今爲樂。迨革命軍興。南京城陷。乃潛逃之滬。閉户研道。不問世事。曾御道裝。攝一造像。并題詩其上。有「朝家若問陶弘景。六月松風枕簟凉」之句。轉示朋儕。以明已志。黎元洪氏薦爲民政長。拒而不受。袁世凱亦慕其才。寵禮有加。卒一度拜命參謀之識。樊氏居官清正。雖位至顯貴。而依然兩袖清風。故身後一切。胥由其摰友李釋戡等爲之屏當。遺一孀媳及孫二。情景頗覺凄凉。惟著作甚富。已行於世者。有詩集詞集駢文集。政書公牘及等記等。其中以詩爲最多。遺詩未刋者約有二萬首以上。眞不愧爲一代詩人矣。若其公牘流行尤廣。腧炙人口。法家咸奉爲圭臬焉。晚年氏獨寄情聲色。每當樽前筵畔。倚紅偎翠之際。則詩興勃發。好句如珠。尤好捧角。致力於花衫子輩。當梅畹華初創天女散花劇時。嘗以詩寵之。極旖旎溫馨之致。至於女伶如新艷秋蓉麗娟孟麗　君劉艷琴小蘭芬及馬家姊妹艷雲艷秋等。亦幾無不經此老一捧而成名。今者溘然長逝。想若輩亦當緊蹙雙蛾。爲之扼腕欷歔不已也。</p>

<p>年逢春秋佳日。滬上必有賽馬之舉。跑馬塲裏。士女如雲。而名騎師亦得乘斯機會。一顯其好身手。賽馬之風。由來甚古。考諸往籍。大約有五千餘載之歷史。自昔君主豢馬。競賽以取樂。初非公諸平民者也。</p>
<p>新近考古家在米沙波達米亞平原發掘若干記載。始悉最古之賽馬。非創自歐洲。而源於亞陸。當時小亞細亞之海蒂民族。酷喜此道。跡其時期。蓋在紀元前一千年以上。記載之中。關於舉行大賽前馬之訓練方法。羅列極詳。波拉哥大學教授侯朗西氏。特將所得。作細密之研究。則知當時民族。縱未完全開化。而賽馬一道。獨具進步。不禁令人稱異。如豢馬須注意食料。不使身體過於肥重。馬體宜勤沐浴。以使周身平均發育。而訓練之際。亦按步就班。緩步快跑。依時遞進。所用方法。確見美備。並據述馬自開始訓練。以至出場比賽。中間時期。約佔六個月云。</p>

<p>去滬期年。月初重來海上。訪名畫師張聿光先生於斜土路之冶歐齊寓邸。並贈細種金魚十餘尾。爲先生壽。緣先生與不佞雅有同嗜也。冶歐齊凡三楹。居園之中心。園廣可二三畝。植花木甚繁。葡萄二架。廣可數尋。惜春初爲積雪所侵。致芽葉漸落。否則大好園林。益足留連矣。齊右一池春水。垂柳拂地。景殊清幽。園側有革命巨子趙聲塑象。象高丈許。魁梧奇偉。不愧一代偉人。詢之張師。知即爲京口公園所製。此其石膏遺型也。入室則四壁琳瑯。有粉畫。油畫。墨炭。水彩。毛筆。墨骨。等作品。咸摹自西方。咸臨之古本。或鎔中西於一爐。創作則居其大半。盡善盡美。非後生小子所敢品評。先生速予坐。承詢鄉邨生活。頗蒙嘉許。蓋不侫雖非雅士。而傲骨天生。不能隨俗浮沈沉淪。心儀先生恃藝術生存。不致仰人鼻患。第婢學夫人之見。恐有所不能耳。旣而月旦時賢。並及先生壯年對於革命之已往功績。張師之言曰。如光富間嘗襄助于右任辦理民立。民呼。民吁等報。鼓吹革命。不遺餘力。時光荏苒。而我老矣。無能爲出。至於黨國要人如老友王正廷。葉楚傖。襟兄鈕惕生。妻弟經亨頣輩。爲國宣勞。至令靡已。而我則盡瘁畫苑。沈醉藝術。已不復有當年豪氣已。言下憮然。時已逾午。愚興辭。先生殷殷留飯。不能却。須臾張夫人黄女士歸。引見之餘。知夫人服務地方看守所有年。爲女界參政之先導者。夫人人極和藹。無時下習氣。殊爲可佩。飽食而歸。援筆記之。</p>
<p>▲短訉　粤歌舞家紫羅蘭女士。此次赴都在國民大戲院表演。每日售座約在二千元以上黨國要人之餽贈亦不下數百件。首都影戲院擬請女士續演。詎爲聯華公司羅明佑邀請赴津。已於二十日搭津浦車起程。到津後在光明大戲院表演三天。再赴北平眞光平安明星等戲院表演。大約一月後方能返滬。再應聯華公司之聘。攝取有聲影片。而蘇杭諸埠來滬邀請表演者。亦不乏云。（嘉）</p>

<h3 id="c156">中華的「西線無戰事」 <a href="#c156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>— 鄭康民</p>
<p>「西線無戰事」爲轟動世界之名着。近頃我國已迻譯多種。。復攝成影片。國人對於此種描寫戰爭之名著。幾乎舉國歡迎。而反顧我國之小説獨少此種偉大的描寫戰爭之創作。則更缺如。誠憾事也。近聞有一偉大之戰爭小説出現。文藝界中人。動色相告、作者蓋即前一度競傳在歸德陣亡之黄君震遐也。黄君已由戰地歸來。並草成「隴海線上」一篇。將親臨戰地生活。及戰事之眞面目。衝鋒陷陣之狀况。士兵之心理。描寫盡致。足與雷馬克之「西線無戰事」相頡頏。而雷氏爲異國情調之作品。與我國讀者之心理頗有隔閡之處。黄君之「隴海線上」實爲本地風光。猶菜蔬然。須吃自家田園所産生。方稱有味。吾料黄君此作。必將洛陽紙貴。風行一時。不讓雷氏專美於前也。</p>
<p>黄君爲何如人乎。讀者諸君當能憶及。過去本報藝術界。常刊載君之詩文。其文筆之遵促。辭藻之優美。在在均予人以深刻之印象君原籍粤東。生長上海。幼失怗。萱堂亦於去年患盲腸炎死。孤苦零丁。僅存弱妹。斯時憂憤交集。百感皆興。遂日以醇酒婦人自娛。北四川路在海上以神秘之街著名。每當月上抑梢。君恒踽踽獨步其間。間或涉足舞塲。狂舞燈影之下。是亦君之身世有不堪告人之痛而出此者。迨後友朋間忽盛傳黄君失踪。跡近離奇。訪問之人遂蜂起。不逾月姑於黄君平日交好中。得悉君於中央軍招募新兵於北站時。彼即應徵。從此投筆從戎。效班定遠之壯舉。而書信亦時有往返。稍間。中央軍校招考。君又錄取。消息傳來。朋輩間咸爲之浮三大白。以誌此日黄君之新生也。會當閻馮稱兵叛亂。中央軍開拔前線。君以中央軍校入伍生之名義得以參與焉。於是音書爲之中斷。及歸德一役。我軍具破釜沉舟之决心。損失較鉅。君之生死未卜。而消息亦杳然矣。凡與黄君識或不識者。均爲之唏嘘不已。以爲刀光血影中。必無生還之理。本報藝術界。及前鋒周刊前鋒月刊。皆先後發表紀念文字。詎知事變無常。消息不易準確。旣而軍事底定。大局敉平。我軍奏凱歸來。方知黄君尚存人世。友朋問獲此佳音。歡欣不可名狀。歸來時君首先即至朱應鵬先生家訪問。沙塲生還。喜出望外。君是時口若懸河。滔滔不絶。并以作戰之顚末相告。遂袖出題名「隴海線上」之作品相示。裒然成帙。詳盡無遺。磨盾草成。讀來益覺生動。誠中國文藝界之最大收獲也。其中地方氣息極爲濃重。如野鷄崗之放峭。陣地民衆之罹鉅刧。流離失所之情景。君以生花妙筆。令讀者恍如置身烽火連天之境。謂爲中國的「西線無戰事」。亦無不可。聞此作將在現代書局出版前鋒月刊第五號上發表。除「隴海線上」外。尙有詩歌「琴與劍」。亦在該刊發表云。</p>
<h3 id="c157">印度遊記（四） <a href="#c157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>二十三日上午。遊各書店。見印人自著英文書。汗牛充棟矣。其學術文化之富。過於吾國。吾國能以英文著作者極少。而印度各種哲學。以英語譯出者亦充斥。觀於太戈爾之世界文化藝術運動。則知西洋已大受印度文化之影響。而中國今日甚爲缺乏。對於世界文化之貢獻。殆微乎其微。昔漢唐之盛。旣定天下。即興文教。况今萬國交通尤宜亟也。與印人談。始知日本伊呂波字母。由僧人空海所製者。本仿印度音。故日本音多加阿二音。今印人發音亦多此二種。故印人土音與英語混合。其英語多與中華之音大異。</p>
<p>印度大學今已有印度史之班次。但辛漢君對我言。印度人之觀念。大與中國人異。印度人不注意君王史。而最注意教派學術。故君王無史。以印度文化之久。然可考者少。自佛滅後阿輸迦王之世。始有明白之史。約在西歷前二百年。其餘神話推測。零碎難數也。按余讀印度名著Gita一書。述其最初傳述之史。始於TheGreatMahabbarataWar3ioi,BC摩訶拉他之大戰云。推想其應在西歷前三一○一矣。距今可五千年。其世代久遠可知也。據格達一書所述。從五千年前之時代。印度教即發生。蓋前乎佛二千餘年。而至今不衰。遍於印度。亦奇觀矣。是應當研究者也。</p>
<p>木痕大那博士Dr,　Mahondranath來訪。并詢問中國道教。延余至其家。余略述中國文化情形。其弟子在旁靜聽。木痕博士言。極希望中國國力進步。及文化之發揚。渠當力爲傳播。渠爲僧加利大學名教授。Sumkrit　College授哲學。余問以西洋哲學如何。渠殊不以爲意。余所讀西人所譯之印度哲學史。承認印度哲學之繁難深邃。非世上人可曉。今印人在哲學上尙自命居最高位置。精神文化上不但執亞洲之牛耳。尙欲居指導世界之位置。太戈爾有詩聖之號。甘地亦稱聖雄。即在獄中。並非獄囚。法官對之皆稱聖雄。先向之行禮。而後發言。此外印人所召集之世界佛教會。亞洲婦女會。均明年開幕。聞今正召集亞藝術會也。</p>

<h3 id="c176">復旦攝影學會與復旦攝影年鑑 <a href="#c176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— 奚佳</p>
<p>我敢説、在學校中學生所辦的攝影團體裏、復旦攝影學會、或許是其中最完善、精神最好的一個吧、這不特一班人如此説、即如現在社會上共同承認的中國第一流攝影作家的華社諸子、也同樣地稱贊過、的確、復旦攝影學會、在社會上已有她相當的地位、這地位的産生、便是那三次轟轟烈烈的攝影展覽會所種的因</p>
<p>復旦攝影學會的創辦、是遠在十七年的時候、經過一年的訓練、就有第一次攝影展覽會的舉行、翌年便有第二次展覽會的實現、到去年和復旦大學二十五週年紀念同時舉行的第三屆展覽會、便是大部分選爲此次發行的復旦攝影年鑑的資料、</p>
<p>這數年來、攝影人才輩出、其作品遂遍於全國各報、而稍稍關心於攝影的人們、對於復旦攝影學會、於是也有相當的認識、</p>
<p>在這次第三屆展覽會時、因爲是和二十五週年紀念同日舉行的緣故、愈使一般人得到了一個極深切的印像、所以、大會以後、各報館、各畫報紛紛要求、咸以一刋復旦攝影作品爲快、這是事實、</p>
<p>然此、攝影學會的人們、還不能自滿、認爲根本上不能給人們以永久流覽的機會、於是才有發行復旦攝影年鑑的願望、</p>
<p>「復旦攝影年鑑」、聽説現在早已發售預約了、據説内容還不止第三屆展覽會的精品而已、其中還參雜着第一屆和第二屆的作品、那末他的成績是更美滿了、</p>
<p>關於攝影集、我看過的是很多了、在中國出版的、我可以説没有一本是盡善盡美的、據説復旦攝影年鑑的銅版、完全是由美利製版公司承製的、至於印刷和紙張、當然也是非常考究的了、</p>
<p>總之、在一個學校範圍以内、組織一個完善的攝影會、已是很不易的了、而况是每年要舉辦一次展覽會、更其是要出版、一本攝影集、眞是難上又難、然而、復旦的攝影學會、都能一一辦到、這非特使我們要非常的欽佩、而且實足以使我們仰慕的了、</p>
<p>現在、該年鑑行將出版了、我願普天下的愛美者、皆宜人手一編、方不辜負這大好的足以賞鑑的「復旦攝影年鑑、」</p>

<h3 id="c177">時代青年—二十九期 <a href="#c177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— 左</p>
<p>在今日苦難時代的中國、一切本來都不能有完好的現象的、就出版界一方面論、書賈都祗知道迎合社會心理、不顧歪屈事實而加速出品、以粗知濫造的無聊書籍來換取（搜括）青年的金錢、但是正有許多青年還甘願受他們的欺騙呢、</p>
<p>眞的、青年們的確也太可憐了、每天除了枯燥無味的學校課本之外要找兩本適宜的課外讀物眞不容易、除了書賈們代理的那種粗製濫造的無聊的書報外、再有什麽書報可供閲讀呢、要找一本作爲青年自身的喉舌刋物或能爲青年界辯護和否定自身方面的書報、眞難似上青天呢、</p>
<p>但是、青年們也不必過於失望、因爲時代青年社出版的「時代青年」已給我們解决上述的難題了、你護、在該刋二十七期、新的開　中有已很明確的説明了、</p>
<p>「我們於此更以必然的不能苟安、便冀表現我們時代青年的精神、使我們的心靈把握正軌的安慰、結果、終於從低氣壓的氛圍之拘約中抬起我們自己的頭來、向奮鬥的征途上前行、」</p>
<p>由於這樣、「時代青年」將成爲時代青年的必讀刋物可知、該刋出版至今、已經半年餘、原先是單張報式的、對於青年運動的理論與實踐上有着深切的探討、自二十七期起改爲書本式、内容更形充實可觀、希每個時代青年對牠應加以特别的注意、茲把最近出版的二十九期推薦如下、</p>
<p>該期的内容計有冰的「我們對於選舉國民會議代表時應有之認識、」萍人的「動的研究與靜的研究、」一瞬的「關於男女同學、」點之的「漫淡青年讀物、」徐則驤的「夢中驚醒、」叙霞的「一天的狂遊」等、於質和量兩方面为較之以前該刋均有着顯著的進步、該刋編者説、</p>
<p>「本刋自改組後到本期爲止、已經又是和讀者第三次見面了、至這改組後的三期内、在量的方面説、多少可以説是加增了、但在質的方面呢、那我們不是個聰明的自知者、所以不敢有肯定的斷語、我們願意讓給讀者去做這項工作、同時、我們更希望能有愛護本刋的讀者常常賜予糾正和指示、俾得我們作爲繩準和南針、」正因爲我是一個讀者、因此我來對於質的方面來加以論斷、雖未必能供該刋作爲繩準和南針、可是在正械尋求良好讀物的青年主面、至少有些許貢獻吧、</p>
<p>氷的「我們對於選舉國民會議代表時應有的認識」一文是最値得我們注意的、在現在國民會議即將開幕、各地正在進行選舉代表的時期、這問題不特青年們當曉得、就是其他人民也是誰都應當知道的呀、作者説、「我們爲了要表現我們這些爲民族運動而奮鬥的、感覺較任何一般人都要鋭　的青年之能力起見、</p>
<p>我們對於這次選舉國民會議代表時確有加以愼重精密之考慮與探索之必要、我們更不能决絶地視爲不圖痛癢地瞎做盲從、我們要抛去一切的雜念、拿出大公無我、不分門　的精神選出一個眞眞不愧爲我們青年界之領袖的人物來、做我們在這次負有諾大使命、解决國事維進政治的國民會議中的代表者啊、」等話、誰説不是呢、</p>
<p>萍人的「動的研究與靜的研究」是憑事實和經騐來寫成的一篇讀書方法、他説研究的目標有靜的和動的兩個方向、</p>
<p>利用這兩種研究法治學、能收下列幾種</p>
<p>下接第九版</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>上接第七版</p>
<p>佳妙的效果、（一）使研究時不至感到枯澀而失却研究學術的興味、（二）二種學術在深切的研究、往往能趨於一途、同時有助於其他一種學術的進展、（三）將來離學校而走進社會時、這樣應用的範圍比較地廣泛而應用的機會也多、（四）能使達到將來有專門研究的捷徑、較之時下正流行的賣膏藥式的所謂各科學習法實際許多、毫無空泛之弊而的確可供青年們讀書的參考、</p>
<p>「關於男女同學二稿爲一瞬所作、以客觀的立場從歷史方面、生物學和社會學方面、學校三身方面來闡明男女同學無論對於人類、社會、道德、教育、性情、種種都有很大的裨益、足爲一般冬哄的當頭醒木、</p>
<p>默之的「漫談青年讀物」對於中國今日的出版界有着深刻的檢討、看了下面所錄的一節、就可知這篇東西自有相當的價値了、</p>
<p>「最後、要曉得、我們現代青年所需要的讀物决不是這樣的簡單、趨於商品化的一類濫汚作品、在知識上、在學問上都不能使我們花費了父兄的血汗而得到相當收效、這類書籍使我們讀了眞是没有絲毫的代價、不過青年們是受這般書賈（或稱市儈）之愚吧、我主觀地説一句切實的話、我們青年現在所需要的讀物、是一種實際的具體的輔助學術上有所進步的文字、那種玄而又玄的思想不正確的東西在現今是一槪不須它的産生、最重要的還是定價要特别低廉、切莫口是心非地一面在高嚷减輕讀者擔負、一面把所售出的書籍除了所定的最高實價多、再依照所謂、「同行公議、照碼加一」的歛錢把戲、錢固然要賺、那深負着的宣揚文化的使命却不要付諸黄海、這也可説是青年們贈與新書業者的箴、」</p>
<p>此外徐則驤的「夢中驚醒」與叔霞的「一天的狂遊」兩篇文藝作品都表現了青年們特有的情感、前者是一首詩、内中有慷慨激昻的呼聲、後者可説是一篇短篇小説为雖作者列爲白雪雜記之二、因爲是用第一人稱所寫的、故表現的題材比較來得更透澈和深切、</p>
<p>末了更附有學校無線電一束、報告各學校的新聞、是青年、大槪誰都喜歡看的吧、</p>
<p>又該刋爲西門方斜路二一○號時代青年社出版、每册祇售三分、確是價廉物美的最適合青年口味的良好讀物、望青年們不要忽略過、</p>

<h3 id="e2">Central Political Council Meeting <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Political Council meeting was held on the morning of the 25th.

Chiang Kai-shek chaired the meeting, and the following was discussed: (1) Reports from the Finance, Economy, Education, and Political Groups were submitted to the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee for deliberation. Sun Ke proposed that two-thirds of the entire Russian Boxer Indemnity be allocated to complete the Longhai Railway project, and that a portion of the remaining two-thirds of the Italian Boxer Indemnity be used to supplement the funds insufficient to complete the Longhai Railway project. Cai, Zhu, Dai, Li, and Wu jointly proposed that 5 million yuan in cash be allocated annually from the interest of the British Boxer Indemnity and the remaining Russian Boxer Indemnity to guarantee the issuance of 10 million yuan in education and cultural construction bonds. Kong, Sun, and Liu jointly proposed that one-third of the Russian Boxer Indemnity and one-third of the Italian Boxer Indemnity, which have not yet been designated for specific uses, be used as capital construction funds for the capital and as a fund for issuing bonds to repay principal and interest. In addition, the Executive Yuan's response to the National Government's proposal to review the methods of guaranteeing interest on the Boxer Indemnity was examined. As a result of the combined review, it was agreed that: 1. Regarding the principle of guaranteeing interest, all Boxer Indemnity projects that have not yet been allocated funds will be recognized at an interest rate of 5% for education and cultural expenditures. Projects that generate their own profits will bear their own interest. Projects that do not generate profits will have their interest borne by the national treasury. Projects that cannot generate profits temporarily will have their interest advanced by the national treasury. 2. Regarding the allocation method, the Executive Yuan will convene relevant agencies related to the Boxer Indemnity to form a committee to discuss the allocation method and submit it to the Political Council for approval. The Ministry of Finance will then issue bonds and distribute the funds as approved. A resolution was passed in accordance with the review report. (3) Wang Chonghui proposed that procedures for sentencing and trying party members who commit crimes be discussed. A resolution was made to refer it to the Legal Group. (4) Kong Xiangxi proposed that plans for developing four types of mineral resources, namely petroleum, gold, copper, and coal, be drafted and that funds be allocated immediately for their development. A resolution was passed to refer it to the Executive Yuan for consideration. (5) Kong Xiangxi proposed that the exact amount of the remaining British and Russian Boxer Indemnities be allocated quickly so that industries could be established based on plans to open up sources of profit. A resolution was passed to incorporate it into the first proposal. The meeting adjourned at around 10:00 AM. (25th Dispatch)</p>

<p>The Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Education Dispatch Personnel to Study</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the abrogation of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Agreement and exchange of notes, the Central Government previously formulated three measures and instructed the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Education to direct Ambassador Wang stationed in Japan to conduct negotiations. Recently, Ambassador Wang telegraphed that he had repeatedly negotiated with the Japanese side but had not yet reached a resolution. After repeated discussions, it was proposed that the two governments first informally appoint a number of special commissioners to gather together and exchange opinions in order to seek a solution within a scope that is acceptable to public opinion in both countries and does not harm the diplomatic relations between the two countries. After the commissioners have reached a consensus, they will then separately request a decision from the governments of both countries. It is now specially reported that, if there are no objections, it is intended to discuss the location and timing of the meeting of commissioners with the Japanese side and then implement it. The Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Education believe that the matter of abrogating the Sino-Japanese Cultural Agreement and the exchange of notes should not be delayed any longer and that Ambassador Wang's proposed method is worthy of adoption. It is proposed that the two ministries first select three to five commissioners to study the abrogation and resolution methods, and that the results of the study be submitted to the Central Political Council for review separately within three months. This has already been submitted to the Central Political Council for review on the 25th. (25th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e25">The Political Party Perspectives of the Current Parliaments of Various Countries <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>The parliaments of various countries in the current term, due to the global commercial decline and economic difficulties, have seen opposition parties initially exerting their best efforts to attack the governments, with the governing parties appearing to be in precarious positions. However, as the period of political strife in the parliaments of various countries draws to a close, the important bills of the governments have been able to pass, and the difficulties faced by the governments are gradually passing. The attempts of the opposition parties in various countries to overthrow the governments have largely been met with disappointment. This is because the difficult position of the world today is a result of broader forces and cannot be controlled by the power of a single country or party. This situation is largely forgivable to the people of those countries. Changing the government would not only fail to alleviate the difficulties but would likely increase the disorder. This is the first reason. Furthermore, the opposition parties in various countries largely come from previous ruling party failures. Their ideologies and policies are more conservative than those of the current rulers. Therefore, no matter how much they attack the current rulers, the general public cannot trust them. This is the second reason. For these two reasons, consider that the Conservative Party in England cannot defeat the Labour Party to replace them, and the Seiyukai in Japan cannot defeat the Minseito to replace them. Beyond this, consider Germany, which, despite attacks from parties on both the extreme left and the extreme right, was ultimately able to safely overcome all difficulties. And the success of the German-Austrian Customs Union has been celebrated throughout the country. The situation here is worthy of deep thought.</p>

<p>The Indian Situation Becomes Serious Again</p>
<p>Agreement Resolution Will Be Affected</p>
<p>Reuter's, Kanpur, 25th - A violent riot occurred here today, with 19 dead and 15 injured. The riot erupted after a demonstration against the execution in Lahore. Many temples and mosques were attacked, and many shops were looted and burned. All yarn factories and commercial firms are closed. The authorities have imposed a curfew. For the past four hours, the entire city has been in a state of panic, with no pedestrians on the streets. Continued telegram: The riot has resumed, and the death toll has reached 30. Hundreds of rioters were injured. Passing vehicles were attacked, and passengers were beaten, injuring several Europeans. The authorities have dispatched two companies of British troops to suppress the riot. Two hundred police officers from Allahabad and Lucknow are rushing here.</p>
<p>Reuter's, Karachi, 24th - At the All-India Congress venue, due to the executions in Lahore, there was no triumphal arch, only mourning clothes; no joyful cheers, only a procession of black flags. Gandhi and Patel could have received a warm welcome here, but Karachi presented a scene of complete commercial closure and deserted markets. The indignation of the people is evident. Although the executions were unexpected and shook the people, a second thought has apparently led the All-India Congress members to adopt a more calm attitude. It is generally believed that the people's loyalty to Gandhi will not be affected by this incident.</p>
<p>Reuter's, Bombay, 24th - There is considerable anxiety and uncertainty as to whether the execution of Bhagat Singh and two others in Lahore yesterday will have an adverse impact on the resolutions of the All-India Congress. Although the cotton market is closed today, trading is still taking place secretly. Today, the price of cotton is 203 rupees and a half per bale weighing 784 pounds.</p>

<p>Rumors of a Possible Hungarian-Italian Agreement</p>
<p>Regarding the New German-Austrian Economic Agreement</p>
<p>Experts from Various Countries Are Studying It</p>
<p>Reuter, Paris, 24th - Parisian newspapers report that a customs agreement between Italy and Hungary, similar to that proposed by Germany and Austria, is possible. The Hungarian Foreign Minister is currently visiting Rome, probably in connection with this plan. An Italian-Hungarian alliance could include Poland, and Hungary could become a natural link between Italy and Poland. Hungary is not hostile to the German plan, but regrets that it has not been taken seriously by Germany, and may therefore consider economic cooperation with Italy.</p>
<p>National, Berlin, 25th - The US Department of Commerce announced that after expert study, the new German-Austrian economic agreement was not found to conflict with existing treaties or minutes, nor can it be considered to violate the most-favored-nation clauses in other commercial agreements. German newspapers attach great importance to this news.</p>
<p>National, Paris, 25th - Reports indicate that British Foreign Secretary Henderson has so far declined to comment on the German-Austrian agreement. When asked, he stated that the British government's legal experts are currently studying its content and that no decision can be made until they submit their report. Currently, French nationalist newspapers are vehemently attacking Foreign Minister Briand, accusing him of timidity and cowardice for being deceived by the Germans. However, most newspapers remain peaceful in their attitude, awaiting the French government's response.</p>
<p>National, Rome, 25th - The Italian government today formally stated that it has only inquired with the Austrian government for details regarding the German-Austrian agreement and is currently having experts study it. The government will decide its response based on their report.</p>
<p>National, Warsaw, 25th - Poland is not very concerned about the German-Austrian agreement. Its political and journalistic circles indicate that the only country that can truly be affected by the agreement is Czechoslovakia. In the past, Poland and Czechoslovakia have repeatedly had disputes over tariff issues, so this time they would rather express sympathy with Germany and Austria. The semi-official Polish Daily only commented that the agreement is a first-rate event in history, without expressing any alarm or opposition.</p>
<p>National, Brussels, 25th - The Belgian Social Democratic Party's newspaper, The People's Paper, commented on the German-Austrian agreement, saying that Luxembourg and Belgium had already established a customs union, and the degree of their union is even greater than that of Germany and Austria. What is being done today is nothing new, but no one has yet accused Luxembourg of losing its sovereignty.</p>
<h3 id="e47">League of Nations Committee Meeting <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Opens in Paris, the Capital of France</p>
<p>Specifically Discussing the Plan for a European Union</p>
<p>Heated Debate Over Inviting Soviet Russia to Participate</p>
<p>National, Paris, 24th - The organizing committee of the European Economic Union opened here this afternoon. Twelve countries are directly participating, and three other countries, including Belgium, Norway, and Estonia, have sent observers to attend. Most countries are represented by their diplomatic envoys to France. In addition to Britain and France, which are represented by their foreign ministers and foreign secretaries, other heads of diplomatic missions participating include Polish Foreign Minister Zaleski, Swiss Foreign Minister Motta, and Danish Foreign Minister Munch. Briand delivered the opening speech at the meeting, but surprisingly did not mention the German-Austrian tax agreement. Later, the representatives of various countries unanimously elected Briand as chairman. Briand then stated that in the face of the current new pressures, the connection of Europe is indispensable, but the committee must not set a grand and unrealistic agenda, nor should it take a narrow view of its responsibilities. The committee met in closed session in the afternoon. Due to strict security, the reporters knew nothing except for the items listed on the agenda. As for the German-Austrian issue, although officials have absolutely denied it, it is predictable that it will occupy most of the debate time.</p>
<p>National, Paris, 24th - Today, the organizing committee meeting abandoned the plan to organize a European Council similar to the Council of the League of Nations and instead organized an administrative body with one chairman. The chairmanship will rotate annually among the countries, and there will be one vice-chairman, whose duties will be similar to those of the Secretary-General of the League of Nations. It was also decided to invite the Free City of Danzig to participate in the European Committee, but the debate over whether to invite the Soviet Union was extremely heated. The Swiss Foreign Minister opposed the participation of the Soviet Union, while Italy and Germany strongly advocated the inclusion of the Moscow government. As a result, it was decided that three European countries that are not members of the League of Nations should be invited to participate in the economic discussions of the European Committee.</p>

<p>Reuter, Madrid, 24th - The King of Spain, who went to London to visit his wife and mother, returned to Madrid today. When the King and Queen were driving into the palace, a group of young royalists cheered for them. Many medical students at the university burned desks and chairs and obstructed traffic. The police opened fire to disperse them, and some students were wounded by gunfire.</p>
<p>Reuter, Madrid, 24th - Republican leaders, who were sentenced to six months in prison by the court last December for signing a Republican declaration, have now been imprisoned for three months and were released this afternoon. The crowd gathered outside the prison and cheered loudly when they saw Zamora, who was elected Prime Minister of the Republic last December, and his comrades leaving the prison gate. They attempted to support Zamora in a parade through the streets, but were prevented by the police.</p>

<p>But Declares No Contractual Form</p>
<p>Sinclair Has Withdrawn His Resignation</p>
<p>Reuter, London, 24th - The Liberal Party Members of Parliament met today for five and a half hours and decided that there should be no contractual form between the Liberal MPs and the Labour government, but the Liberal Party agrees to unanimously support the Labour government, provided that the government implements certain political programs that the Liberal Party deems necessary at present. The Liberal Party later decided by a vote of 33 to 17 on a declaration regarding the Liberal Party's attitude towards the government in the House of Commons, stating no contract, no alliance, and the independence of the Liberal Party. The meeting agreed on the declaration, the content of which will remain secret until George announces it at the Liberal Party candidates' meeting on Thursday. Sir Simon, one of the 17 who opposed supporting the government, left the meeting before it ended. Since the content of the declaration is being kept secret, it is currently impossible to determine what important impact this declaration will have on the political situation. Sinclair, the head of party affairs, recently resigned but withdrew his letter of resignation at the meeting today and was re-elected as head of party affairs.</p>

<p>Nearly Two Hundred Killed on Both Sides</p>
<p>Reuter's, New York, 24th - According to news from the Peruvian capital, three companies of infantry mutinied against the government troops last night, causing disturbances for four hours until their headquarters was destroyed by shelling, after which they surrendered. Forty people were killed. The authorities have declared martial law. The mutineers, commanded by two sergeants, first detained the officers and then opened fire on the Presidential Palace with rifles and machine guns. Pedestrians fled in panic. Later, Army Chief of Staff Jimenez led troops to drive them back and rushed to the mutineers' camp. It was already late at night. Jimenez ordered his troops to stand by, and if he did not return in ten minutes, they could shell the camp. The troops agreed. After waiting for fifteen minutes, Jimenez still did not appear, so they broke through the camp gate and charged in with bayonets. The mutineers were discouraged and surrendered their weapons. Another telegram: A total of two hundred people were killed in the disturbances in the Peruvian capital last night, mostly mutineers. It is rumored that it was caused by the Communist Party's movement, but it also contained factionalism and ambition.</p>

<p>Departed at 3 PM on the 21st</p>
<p>Scheduled to Arrive in Moscow on the 28th</p>
<p>A Special Train of Seven Cars with 32 Personnel</p>
<p>Karakhan Telegraphed to Express Welcome</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: Mo Dehui, the Plenipotentiary for the Sino-Soviet Conference, along with a delegation of 32 special committee members and secretaries, departed by special train for Russia at 3:05 PM today (21st). The special train consisted of a first-class official car for Mo and his wife, two first and second-class sleeping cars for the special committee members and secretaries, two second-class sleeping cars for the clerks, two official cars for servants and baggage, and a dining car. Mo's second son, Songheng, is also traveling by train to take up his post as the head of the Chita Consulate General, along with his family. At 2:40 PM on the 21st, Mo and his wife arrived at the station after a banquet at the Public Office with the directors of the Sino-Russian Department of the Railway Bureau. The Special Police Department's Security Team and the Railway Superintendent's Guard dispatched large teams of armed police to maintain order at the station. About several thousand people from all walks of life came to see them off. Businessmen and students from various schools in the Special District also lined up to see them off, each holding banners with slogans. Important figures present included Zhang Jinghui, the Chief Executive of the Special District; Zang Qifang, the Director of the Land Bureau of the Special District; Song Wenyu, the Mayor; Chen Kezheng, the President of the Special Court; Zhou Shouyi, the Director of the Education Department of the Special District; Ding Chao, the Garrison Commander of Binjiang; Zhao Jinlin, the Chief of Staff of the Railway Protection Army Headquarters; Yemushanafu, the Russian Director of the Eastern Railway; Danilevsky, the Director; Li Shaogeng, the Chinese Acting Director; Shen Ruilin and Zou Shangyou, the Directors, and others, totaling over a hundred people. Foreign consuls such as the Russian Consul Melnikov, the American Consul Hanson, and the Japanese Consul Yagi also attended. At 2:50 PM, Mr. Mo boarded the train, stood on the train steps, took off his hat, and greeted the crowd. At 3:05 PM, with a whistle, the special train began to move, and the well-wishers shouted slogans such as "Long Live China," "Long Live Plenipotentiary Mo," and "Smooth Sino-Russian Negotiations," accompanied by melodious military music, creating an extremely warm atmosphere. The crowd did not disperse until the train had left the station. Mo's special train will not stop at any of the small stations along the way. It will cross the border from Manzhouli Station at 12:00 AM on the 22nd, but it plans to stop for three hours at Zalanor to inspect the local coal mines to determine whether they can be restored. The mines were destroyed during the Russian unrest in 1929 and have not been restored since, and have now become a problem between the Sino-Russian railways. It is expected to arrive in Chita on March 24 and in Moscow at 10:00 AM on the 28th. The 32 people traveling with him, in addition to Mo's wife and the families of the staff, include special committee members Wang Mingchen, Li Chen, Liu Zerong, and Zhang Shouzeng; secretaries Wang Yinchuan, Wu Zesheng, Zhang Mingzhe, Tong Deshan, and Wu Run; staff members Wu Hongyou, Chen Guangqi, and Nan Wenming; and clerks Feng Jie, Dai Yunzhang, Fu Dejin, Guan Ronggui, and Ge Jingzhen. Special committee members Xu Jianping and Qian Tai telegraphed today, saying that they will arrive in Harbin in a week. Mo has instructed the diplomatic messenger to transmit Zhan Wen to Xu and Qian when they arrive in Harbin and send it to Russia. Their diplomatic passports have been processed. In addition, the Central Government has additionally assigned Lao Weixiu as a secretary, who will also come with Xu and Qian. The delegation's expenses were initially set at 52,000 yuan per month, but have recently been increased to 60,000 yuan. A batch of 50,000 yuan was remitted by the Central Government some days ago and was immediately remitted to Moscow via Liaomi.</p>
<p>On the evening of the 19th, the Russian Consul-General in Harbin, Melnikov, hosted a banquet for the delegation at the Eastern Railway Club. At the banquet, Mr. Melnikov said that he had received telegrams from his government and Karakhan instructing him to express their welcome to Plenipotentiary Mo. Regarding the diplomatic passports, the Russian Consul expressed his special goodwill and provided convenience for their issuance. The delegation can pick them up at any time. Various groups and organizations have been bidding farewell to Mr. Mo since the 17th, so Mr. Mo has been extremely busy these past few days. At 1:00 PM on the 20th, Mo also hosted a banquet at his private residence on Dazhi Street, Ximajiagou, inviting various newspapers, news agencies, and reporters from Tianjin and Shanghai stationed in Harbin. Mo delivered a speech at the banquet, briefly stating that he was about to leave the country and had invited everyone here for a gathering. He was honored by their presence. In terms of the long history and international situation between China and the Soviet Union, it is necessary to quickly resolve all issues. This is Mo's first trip to Russia. The Sino-Russian Conference has undergone two rounds of negotiations, and all difficulties have been eliminated. This is now his second trip to Russia, and he will continue to proceed with the same spirit as before. However, the scope of this conference has been expanded, and the responsibility is extremely heavy. He hopes that the gentlemen of the press will uphold international rights and not be afraid of the long journey, and will provide guidance at the appropriate time. Guan Hongyi, the president of the Harbin Public Gazette, replied on behalf of the press. During the banquet, Mo also told the reporters that our side already has full sincerity for this conference. As long as the Soviet Union treats us with the same attitude, the future is naturally optimistic. However, as the scope of the conference has been expanded, the three groups of the Eastern Railway, trade, and resumption of diplomatic relations will be carried out simultaneously, and the issues are complex, which is known to everyone. The matter of trade is particularly complicated, and it is difficult to complete without a longer period of research. The economic relationship between China and the Soviet Union is extremely close. Now that both sides have agreed on the principle of equal trade, every item and every matter should be sought to be fair. When discussing items and concluding treaties, we must carefully consider them. Therefore, the duration of the conference is difficult to predict. Afterwards, the host and guests dispersed in joy.

<h3 id="e58">Huang Shaoxiong Comes to the Province from Hong Kong <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>To Consult with the Guangdong Authorities on the Guangxi Situation</p>
<p>There Are Still Rumors of Zhang, Li, and Others Resigning and Going Abroad</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The Guangxi situation is proceeding peacefully. Although the two sides have been very close recently, there are still matters that need to be discussed further. Therefore, after the second batch of troops from the Eighth Route Army returned to Guangdong, the third batch remains temporarily stationed between Guiping and Guixian, guarding the key fortresses of the Dazhao River, awaiting the complete resolution of the Guangxi situation before withdrawing. It has been learned that after the withdrawal of the Yu Division of the Eighth Route Army from the front line of Binyang, Bai Chongxi of the Guangxi military has dispatched Liang Hansong's division of about 2,000 men, plus about 1,000 militiamen, to be stationed in Laibin and Qianjiang. The Guangxi military police regiment is stationed in Xiangxian. In the Nanning and Shanglin areas, Zhang Fakui, Huang Heling, and Huang Xuchu's troops of about 2,000 men are stationed separately. On the 3rd of this month, Huang Heling sent another regiment to station in Binyang. As for the attitude of Zhang Jiajun's leaders, it is rumored that Zhang, Li, and others have decided to step down and go abroad. Once the Central Government allocates funds for their travel expenses and Guangxi's post-war reconstruction, they can implement their dismissal. Huang Shaoxiong, who is mediating peace in Hong Kong, sent Xia Wei, the former commander of the Seventh Brigade of the Seventh Army, to Guangxi a few days ago to consult with Li, Bai, and others. Mr. Xia has been in Yongning for over a week, but no definitive news has been received. Zhang, Li, and Bai have also sent representatives Huang Yansheng and Li Daqun to Hong Kong to meet with Huang Shaoxiong to discuss everything. The result has been quite good. Huang Yansheng and others have long since returned to Guangxi to report on their duties. Now, Huang Shaoxiong believes that the peaceful resolution of the Guangxi situation should be realized as soon as possible, so he took a ship to the province from Hong Kong on the evening of the 18th of this month. Chen Jitang, the commander-in-chief of the Eighth Route Army, sent Chen Weizhou, the Salt Transport Commissioner, and He Luo, the director of the arsenal, to Hong Kong to welcome him. Huang arrived at the dock at about 6:00 AM on the 19th and, after exchanging greetings with the welcomers, went to the Xinya Hotel with his nephew Huang Weifang and Mr. Gong Jieyuan to stay temporarily. Then, accompanied by Du Yiqian, the chief of staff of the Eighth Route Army who came to meet him, he went directly to the Tuisi Garden in Dongshan to meet with Chen Jitang and Chen Mingshu and had breakfast in the garden. Many people from the financial circles of Guangxi and Guangdong accompanied them. At noon, Huang, accompanied by Gong Jieyuan, Wu Fan, Yang Dingzhong, and others, drove to Baiyun Mountain and toured the scenic spots of Nengren Temple and Lianquan Temple. At 3:00 PM, he returned to the Tuisi Garden to stay. In the evening, Chen Mingshu hosted a banquet to entertain him. It has been learned that Huang came here specifically to consult on the peaceful settlement of the Guangxi issue and will stay in Guangdong for a few days before returning to Hong Kong. According to Gong Jieyuan, one of Huang's close associates, the Guangxi peace is still in progress, and rumors of obstruction are purely false. Guangxi military generals Huang Xuchu and Wei Yunsong have not resigned. Wu Tingyang, the deputy director, went to Beijing this time to ask for instructions on how to settle the Guangxi situation.

<h3 id="e59">Ministry of Finance Revises Regulations on Business Tax in Jiangsu Province <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>The "Regulations on the Collection of Business Tax in Jiangsu Province" and its implementation rules were previously passed by the 367th meeting of the Provincial Government and submitted to the Ministry of Finance for record. Various chambers of commerce in the counties, believing that the provincial regulations violated the outlines set by the Ministry, once held a meeting in Zhenjiang to discuss the matter and sent representatives to Beijing to petition for correction. It is now learned that the provincial regulations have been revised by the Ministry of Finance and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval according to law. However, due to the sudden drop in revenue in Jiangsu Province after the abolition of the likin tax, which urgently needs to be compensated without delay, the revised regulations and implementation rules have been sent back to the Provincial Government for implementation. The revised draft is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Regulations on the Collection of Business Tax in Jiangsu Province (Article 1) These regulations are in accordance with the "Outlines for Business Tax" and "Supplementary Measures" promulgated by the Ministry of Finance. (Article 2) All businesses operating within Jiangsu Province shall pay taxes in accordance with these regulations, unless otherwise stipulated by the Central Government. (Article 3) The standards for collecting business tax are provisionally set as two types: (1) Based on business turnover; (2) Based on capital. (Article 4) The business tax rates are stipulated as follows: (1) For those based on business turnover, the tax rate ranges from one per thousand to ten per thousand. (2) For those based on capital, the tax rate ranges from two per thousand to twenty per thousand. The tax rate levels mentioned above will be separately specified according to the nature of each industry. (Article 5) All businesses operating in this province, whether newly established or old, must apply for a business license by providing the following information: 1. Business type, name, and location; 2. Name, origin, and address of the business operator; 3. Business capital; 4. Estimated annual business income. The aforementioned business license shall be renewed annually without any fee. (Article 6) The tax collection agency may, when necessary, dispatch personnel to investigate and inspect the ledgers, documents, and goods used by the business operator, but must do so in conjunction with the local chamber of commerce. Without the resolution and permission of the business tax review committee, it is not allowed to remove the ledgers, documents, etc., from the inspected shop for investigation and inspection. (Article 7) If a business operator makes a false declaration, either by overreporting less or concealing information, thereby evading tax, or operates without a license, or fails to renew the license when required, in addition to being ordered to pay the taxes and obtain a license, a corresponding fine will be imposed. The penalty rules will be formulated separately. (Article 8) Businesses with operating capital of less than 500 yuan are exempt from business tax but must still apply for a business license to operate. (Article 9) For those whose tax base is based on turnover, the total annual tax payable is determined according to their estimated annual business income and tax rate. For those whose tax base is based on capital, the total annual tax payable is determined according to their capital and tax rate, divided into twelve months, and collected monthly (the monthly collection amount is one-twelfth of the annual tax amount). Receipts shall be issued by the Department of Finance. The business tax for newly opened shops shall be calculated from the month of commencement of business. (Article 10) If a business operator fails to pay the monthly tax due for more than one month, a late payment surcharge of 20% will be added. If the payment is not made for more than three months, the business may be suspended, and the tax and late payment surcharge will still be pursued. However, if the delay in payment is due to the delay of the collection agency, no late payment surcharge will be added, and no suspension of business will be imposed. (Article 11) For businesses whose types are omitted from the tax schedule but meet the nature of business tax collection, the collection agency shall propose an appropriate tax rate and submit it to the competent authority for approval and then forward it to the Ministry of Finance for review and record. (Article 12) The calculation of the capital standard amount shall be based on what is actually used for business purposes. Public reserve funds, etc., should be considered as capital. (Article 13) The calculation of business tax amount shall be based on the industry as a unit. If a household operates several industries with different tax rates, it shall be determined according to the main part of its business. (Article 14) For the sale of goods that are wholesale or bulk sales without retail, the business tax may be collected at half the rate. (Article 15) If various businesses have branches in this province, their business tax may be paid by the head office. If the head office or branch is located outside the province, it shall be remitted through the branch or head office located within the province to pay the business tax. (Article 16) Each county's business tax bureau and director shall organize a business tax review committee. (Article 17) The organization and rules of the business tax review committee will be formulated separately. (Article 18) If a business operator changes its business, adds new capital, or transfers ownership, it shall immediately report it to the competent collection agency and exchange for a new business license. (Article 19) When a business operator ceases operation, it must report to the competent collection agency within fifteen days and pay the tax due before the suspension of business. (Article 20) The collection agency shall announce the collected business tax amount monthly and compile a collection record at the end of each year, which shall be reviewed by the review committee and published with the signature of all members. (Article 21) After the implementation of the business tax, the original tooth tax, pawn tax, slaughter tax, liquor and tea house industry tax, hotel industry tax, entertainment venue industry tax, and other taxes that have not yet been collected and are the same as the business tax shall be temporarily handled according to the old regulations. After the business tax is fully implemented throughout the province, the above-mentioned original tax rates shall be changed to the business tax rates for collection. (Article 22) Detailed rules for the implementation of these regulations will be formulated separately. (Article 23) These regulations shall be reported to the Ministry of Finance for record, then promulgated and implemented.</p>
<p>Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Regulations on the Collection of Business Tax in Jiangsu Province (Article 1) These detailed rules are formulated in accordance with Article 22 of the "Regulations on Business Tax in Jiangsu Province." (Article 2) The collection of business tax shall be handled by special bureaus established in counties designated by the Department of Finance as having prosperous commerce. Those that are not prosperous shall still be handled concurrently by the county government or finance bureau. (Article 3) All businesses operating within this province must apply for a business license before being allowed to operate. (Article 4) The business license mentioned in the preceding article shall be displayed by the business operator in a conspicuous place in the store for inspection.

(Article 9) When calculating taxes, the decimals shall be rounded to the nearest li, with fractions below li rounded up if 5 or higher. (Article 10) When a business operator fills out a declaration form, if the household operates more than two types of businesses with different tax rates, it shall declare truthfully according to the main part of its business.

A copy shall be prepared and submitted to the Department of Finance for record. (Article 12) The Department of Finance, based on the reports from various county bureaus, may at any time dispatch special commissioners to conduct random inspections in conjunction with representatives of the local chamber of commerce.

(Article 16) These detailed rules shall be implemented simultaneously with the Business Tax Regulations of Jiangsu Province. (Article 17) If there are any matters not covered in these detailed rules, the Department of Finance may propose amendments to the Provincial Government at any time and report them to the Ministry of Finance for review and record.

<h3 id="e60">Lu Army Encircles and Suppresses Bandits in Baodu Ridge <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Han Fuju, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government and Commander-in-Chief of the Third Route Army, has decided to clear out Baodu Ridge, the bandits' nest of many years. He has formulated methods for encirclement and suppression. In addition to the Third Route Army's Cao Fulin, commanding Qiao Lizhi's division, and Zhan Shutang and Ning Chunxiao's two brigades, responsible for the northeast side, and Gu Liangmin's 22nd Division responsible for the Sishui route on the west side, he will also unite with Wang Jun's 7th Division in Tengxian, Ma Hongkui's 15th Route Army in Tai'an, and Chen Yaohan's 26th Division in Yizhou to implement a large-scale encirclement. Cao's 29th Division's engineering battalion, cavalry battalion, cadet battalion, and military band left Jinan for Qingzhou by train at 9:00 AM yesterday. The second train, carrying the division headquarters' eight departments and pistol battalion, led by Deputy Division Commander Xu Wenyao and Chief of Staff Wang Shiqi, also left for Qingzhou at 5:00 PM. After Gu Liangmin's 22nd Division was ordered to mobilize, the Jinpu Railway prepared four empty trains to first send the troops of Tang Yaoxun's 65th Brigade, all of whom got off at Yaocun and went to Sishui on foot via Qufu. Cao Fulin himself is scheduled to go to Qingzhou today. Han Fuju will also personally supervise the troops. The special train has been prepared, but it is not yet known whether he will go to Tengxian or Qingzhou.</p>
<p>Further news: The first regiment of the advance troops of the 65th Brigade, Tang Yaoxun, Kong Xiangsheng's unit, departed from Jinan southward on the first train at 1:50 PM today (23rd). The brigade headquarters and cavalry are loading onto the second train. The third and fourth trains are also being loaded and transported. Cao Fulin, commander of the 29th Division, who is responsible for commanding the northeast front, took the Jiaoji passenger train directly to Qingzhou at 12:00. Tang Yaoxun personally led the brigade staff and cavalry south on a train at 6:10 PM (23rd).</p>
<h3 id="e61">Guo Jingluan Receives Guests from All Walks of Life in Jinan <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Madam Guo Jingluan, wife of Cai Gongshi, recently came to Jinan to search for the remains of Cai Gongshi for burial and to seek to recover the old Negotiation Office address to build a martyrs' shrine as a permanent memorial. At 6:00 PM on the 23rd, Madam Cai hosted a banquet at the YMCA to receive important party and government figures, representatives of various organizations, and reporters from various newspapers. Those present included Shandong Provincial Government Chairman Han Fuju, Provincial Reorganization Committee members He Siyuan, Zhang Weicun, Zhang Hongjian, Provincial Committee members Zhang Honglie, Wang Xiangrong, Wang Fangting, Jinan Mayor Wen Chenglie, Secretary-General Xing Lantian, County Reorganization Committee members Zhang Zhuxi, Li Hansan, Yu Hongyan, Public Security Bureau Chief Wang Kairu, and others, totaling over a hundred people. On the host side, in addition to Madam Cai, Cai Yushan and Guo Ruheng were responsible for entertaining everyone. During the banquet, He Siyuan first introduced Han Chunru (an old worker at the former Negotiation Office whose son was a secretary at the Negotiation Office and was killed at the same time as Cai Gongshi; Han was spared because he went to the city to post slogans), Xin Changsheng (a handyman at the former Negotiation Office who was tied up with Cai Gongshi by the Japanese and temporarily escaped, shot five times by Japanese soldiers but not killed), and Zhang Hanru (Cai Gongshi's bodyguard who escaped from a gap in the wall when Cai was brutally killed by the Japanese, hit by several bullets, and fortunately, a Chinese man pushing water, ordered him to pose as a water carrier, thus avoiding death). The three men reported on the tragic circumstances of Cai Gongshi's death, with tears in their eyes. Next, Madam Cai delivered a speech, saying briefly that she was extremely honored by the presence of everyone. This time, Jingluan came to Jinan to search for the remains of Martyr Cai and to discuss building a martyrs' shrine as a permanent memorial. Four years have passed since the tragedy occurred. Jingluan organized the Gongshi School in Shanghai and went to Nanyang to raise over 300,000 yuan, which was fortunately established. She also suffered from repeated discomfort and was sick, so she came only today. Because she is unfamiliar with the people and place, she hopes that everyone will give her guidance and assistance. Next, Guo Yumin read out the proposed opinions drafted by Madam Cai (the original text is very long and omitted). Finally, He Siyuan and Han Fuju delivered speeches one after another, generally saying that the May 3rd Massacre and Martyr Cai's martyrdom were a great humiliation to our country, and the people of the country were all indignant. Today, being entertained by Madam Cai, they felt extremely ashamed. Martyr Cai's death is of great importance to the party and the country, and how to properly handle it is enough to comfort his heroic soul. They highly agreed with the opinions put forward by Madam Cai, but it is best to nominate a few people to formulate detailed measures. Therefore, He Siyuan, Zhang Weicun, Wen Chenglie, Chen Jiadong (Director of the Stamp, Tobacco, and Alcohol Tax Bureau), Cui Shijie (Jiaoji Railway Committee Member), Wang Kairu, Lu Tingzhuan (President of the Bank of Communications), Xing Lantian, and Madam Cai were nominated as eleven members to form a committee, scheduled to meet at the Jiaoji Hotel at 2:00 PM on the 24th to study everything. At 9:00 PM, a photo was taken and they dispersed (23rd).</p>
<h3 id="e62">Resolution of Chen Yuxi's Injury Case <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: On the 12th of this month, when the Jinan Municipal Government held a memorial service for the death of Sun Yat-sen, Chen Yuxi, a female student from a girls' middle school, was injured by a military vehicle while attending the meeting (as reported in previous newspapers). It is reported that Chen Yuxi's injured foot bone was broken in two places and has now been reattached by a doctor. Her life is no longer in danger, but she may be crippled and not return to her original condition after recovery. Regarding the resolution method, because Chen Yuxi's father, Chen Boyan, is a Jinan salt merchant, he has repeatedly stated that he does not want any consolation money or medical expenses. Therefore, the school recently sent a letter to the Public Security Bureau, only requesting seven items, deleting the consolation money item. The official letter said: Our school organized a team to go to the Municipal Government on March 12 to participate in the sixth anniversary memorial meeting for the death of Sun Yat-sen. Student Chen Yuxi was injured by military vehicle No. 6. The matter has been communicated in the record. As for the various matters that should be handled afterwards, your bureau chief has accepted the handling of the matter, for which we are very grateful. In addition to listing the items to be handled one by one, we hereby inform you and hope you will investigate and handle them and give a reply. A total of seven conditions are attached: (1) The Public Security Bureau should issue a notice that vehicles of any business or any organization should not be driven quickly to avoid causing disasters. (2) The driver of the car should be severely punished according to the law. (3) Prevent the recurrence of similar incidents in the future. (4) The owner of the car that caused the accident should apologize to the family of the injured student. (5) Punish the police officer on duty at the scene of the accident. (6) Any car should not be driven into the meeting place when holding a citizens' congress. (7) Cars should not rush into the team when encountering a citizens' congress marching in formation. After receiving the letter, the Public Security Bureau is deliberating. Chairman of the Provincial Government Han Fuju returned to Jinan from inspecting northern Shandong and heard about the matter. He attached great importance to it and immediately summoned Jinan Mayor Wen Chenglie to inquire about everything. After Wen reported in detail, Han immediately instructed Wen to order the Public Security Bureau to send the driver of military vehicle No. 6 to the local court immediately to be punished according to law and allocated 200 yuan to Chen for medical expenses, ordering Wen to personally send it to Chen's family and express condolences. The municipal government has now formulated seven rules for drivers of motor vehicles to pay attention to and announced their implementation. It is expected that this case can be considered resolved (22nd).</p>
<h3 id="e63">After the Qingdao Indigenous Product Merchants' Strike <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Sharp Decline in Customs and Port Bureau Revenue</p>
<p>More Than Ten Thousand Dockworkers Unemployed</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Qingdao's local product merchants were unable to bear the inspection fees charged by the Commodity Inspection Bureau for domestically sold peanut kernels and peanut oil, so they collectively went on strike on the 17th and sent representatives to petition the party and government agencies. Both the party and government sides believed that the strike of the local product merchants had a great impact on the market, and the financial and labor sectors were also severely hit. If a solution was not found quickly, the city's commerce would be unbearable. The Party Headquarters specially sent the two members, Hou Shenglin and Qin Yiwen, and the municipal government sent Secretary-General Hu Jiafeng. Yesterday (21st), they went to the Commodity Inspection Bureau together to discuss mediation methods with the Bureau Chief, Mou Junde. The discussion lasted for two hours, but no agreement was reached. It is reported that the local product merchants are very firm in their attitude in this strike. If they do not achieve their goals, they will find a way to export through Yantai and Longkou to avoid inspection and fees. Since the strike of the local product merchants, the market has been greatly affected. The first to bear the brunt are the general workers and shipping companies, followed by the customs and port bureaus. Because the merchants have stopped transporting goods, Butterfield &amp; Swire has telegraphed foreign ships to temporarily stop coming to Qingdao. Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. is also planning to follow Butterfield &amp; Swire's example because the strike has no end in sight. During the strike, there are already more than 10,000 unemployed dockworkers. These workers rely on loading and unloading cargo ships for a living. Once unemployed, they face the risk of freezing and starvation. The Qingdao Customs and Port Bureau have seen a sharp decline in various tax revenues in recent days because local products have all stopped being transported. Qingdao's exports of local products are mainly peanut kernels and peanut oil. Since the strike on the 17th, peanut kernels and peanut oil have fallen sharply in price due to lack of sales. Peanut kernels were around 11.5 yuan before the strike and have fallen to below 10.02 yuan in recent days. Peanut oil was around 23 yuan before the strike and has fallen to below 21 yuan in recent days. The Shanghai Exchange has also been greatly affected and has fallen from more than forty taels to just over thirty-seven taels in recent days. If the strike problem is not resolved quickly, it is feared that all industries will suffer a panic (March 22nd).</p>
<h3 id="e64">Bandit Alarms in Fujian Province Recently <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Lu's Troops Defect One After Another</p>
<p>Suburbs Harassed by Bandits</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: In Fujian Province in recent years, there have been repeated incidents of mutinies by stationed troops. For example, the two companies of Yu and Zhuo in Qian Yuguang's troops and Chen Heling in Zhang Ziming's troops are notable. Recently, the two battalions of Rao Kairu and Wei Jianxin in Lu Xingbang's troops also mutinied. After Lu pursued and suppressed them, they fled to Shunchang. Lu has now telegraphed the Provincial Government not to allow the Shunchang County Magistrate to accept them. Recently, Huang Ruobai, Director of the Business Tax Preparation Office in Shaowu, telegraphed the Provincial Government, saying that on the 18th, the troops stationed in Guangze under Ma mutinied, and the County Magistrate Li Dai was killed. The order is in chaos. At the same time, the section chief of the county also had the same report and asked for telegrams to various armies to suppress the bandits and to send personnel to handle county affairs. It is found that Ma's troops should be Ma Hongzao's battalion under Lu Xinming, and Lu Xinming telegraphed the province yesterday that he had entered Liancheng. At present, it is still impossible to know the truth. The villages northwest of Fuzhou have recently heard of bandit alarms one after another. On the evening of the 20th, Meiting Township, six or seven li away from the West City, was looted by the bandits under He Enniu and Li Yirun. The villagers, hearing the news, fled in advance. The troops rushed overnight, but the bandits had fled far away. On the morning of the 21st, dozens of farmers held flags and petitioned the Provincial Government, hoping that they would send capable troops to the area to station and maintain security (March 21st).</p>

<p>His Troops Will Be Stationed on the Border Waiting for Orders</p>
<p>Deng Xihou, the General Commander of the Fourteenth Route Army, recently telegraphed the headquarters, reporting in detail the bandit army's disturbances in the Chuanbian (Sichuan border region), Shaanxi, and Gansu areas. The original telegram stated: "My troops are stationed in Songmao, close to southern Longnan. In recent years, we have been protecting merchants and maintaining transportation between Sichuan and Gansu, making it convenient for travelers. Recently, taking advantage of the military unrest, bandit leaders such as Ma Tingxian gathered bandits into an army and arbitrarily appointed military commanders and commanders-in-chief, committing all kinds of atrocities in southern Longnan. After the defeat of the rebellious Feng (Yuxiang), the defeated soldiers joined them, intensifying the devastation. Local organizations and people have repeatedly pleaded for the dispatch of troops for rescue, and their descriptions of the atrocities are beyond imagination. The bandit Ma Tingxian and his subordinates, military commanders Ma Zhong, Wang Zhanlin, Han Jin, Ma Rucang, etc., are all of cruel nature and intent on slaughter. When attacking southern Shaanxi, they carried out massacres in every city they captured. Young women, girls, and young boys were all raped. Their methods of killing men involved breaking their limbs, abandoning them by the roadside, where they would groan for three or four days without dying. Or they would cut open their abdomens and stuff them with grass to feed cattle and horses, or burn copper and iron instruments to brand their faces to extort money. Women were gathered in groups of dozens and raped by bandits until death to satisfy their desires. Others were placed in the Seven-Room Building in Tianshui for the bandit leaders to compete in debauchery. If not used, they were tied up, and boiling oil was poured into their vaginas, or burning coals were inserted into their genitals. As for killing infants, they were placed on the ground between two door panels, and four or five people would repeatedly trample them until their brains and intestines were crushed. The elderly and weak were locked in dark rooms, and soldiers would enter and kill them indiscriminately until they were exhausted. They enjoyed this game every day. They even dug several mass graves outside Tianshui City and buried men, women, old, and young alive in them. In the Dongyao cave in Dingxi, more than 8,000 people were buried alive. The number of people killed determined the rank of officials. In these months, the number of people slaughtered, burned to death, and raped to death is countless. The number of those who committed suicide by jumping into wells, taking poison, or hanging themselves from the city walls due to rape is even greater. The most cruel act was Wang Zhanlin's capture of Lixian County. The people all defended themselves. After the city was captured, he ordered the city to be cleansed, and except for a few women who were captured, no one, young or old, in the entire city was spared. His brutal acts far exceeded those of Zhang Xianzhong, and it was a cruelty unprecedented in history. Your Excellency, please have pity on the small people trapped in misery and order me to lead my troops to clear the countryside and maintain the border. On the one hand, I will report in detail the situation of entering Gansu to clear the bandits and request instructions on strategy. On the other hand, I will also send personnel to the bandits'驻地, explaining the advantages and disadvantages, hoping that they will correct their mistakes, return to the right path, and follow the national law. However, the bandits could not be reasoned with and even shot all the representatives I sent. Taking advantage of our lack of preparation, they colluded with Xiao Jitang, who claimed to be the commander of the Anti-Rebel Army, and led their gangs Bai Yun, etc., to launch a large-scale attack. The Wencun and Bicun locations were repeatedly in danger. After a hard battle for more than ten days by my troops, the bandit troops were finally repelled, and the residents near Wenxian County were slightly relieved. Unexpectedly, the bandits' ambitions were not curbed, and they frequently came to loot. The county people are terrified, fearing only the departure of my troops, and they wept and begged us to stay. Because Gansu Province also belongs to the national territory and is also part of the Chinese people, how can we discriminate against those who are crying under the knife without saving them? The bandits are so rampant that they are not only a pain for the people of Sichuan and Gansu but will also become a concern for the central government's westward gaze. Therefore, I especially reveal the truth and earnestly request the central government to first send personnel to Gansu to investigate the truth of the suffering of the Gansu people so that rumors will cease. On one hand, mobilize several divisions of the national army to open up Shaanxi and supervise the suppression. My troops will be stationed on the border waiting for orders. If the bandit troubles can be eliminated, it will not only be a blessing for the people of Gansu, but also the merchants and travelers on the Sichuan border will benefit from it."</p>
<h3 id="e66">The Shanxi Provincial Party Department Telegraphs Again Requesting the Reorganization of the Ordnance Factory <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Advocating for its Conversion into a Machinery and Rail Manufacturing Plant</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: Although the central government and the Northeast authorities have sent personnel to inspect the reorganization of the Shanxi Ordnance Factory, a definite solution has not yet been determined. Recently, with the closure of the headquarters, the factory's funding has no source. Although the public unanimously advocates for converting it into a people's livelihood institution, there is still no effect. The Provincial Party Department specially telegraphed the central government again yesterday, requesting the factory to be converted into agricultural and industrial machinery and Datong-Puzhou railway rail manufacturing plants to meet the public's opinion and eliminate the source of trouble. The original text is as follows: "To the Nanjing Central Executive Committee, Your Excellencies: We have successively telegraphed to you the disadvantages of the Shanxi Ordnance Factory and the reasons why it should be converted into a productive enterprise. Now, based on the Premier's industrial plan and the needs of Shanxi's current environment, we further clarify the matter. If China wants to develop agriculture to enrich the people, then improving agricultural tools is essential. The Premier saw this early on, so in the industrial plan, there was a proposal to set up an agricultural tool manufacturing plant. Now, the factory's machinery can be used to manufacture new-style agricultural tools for improving agriculture in Shanxi and land reclamation in the Northwest, which will be of unlimited benefit. This is the first point. Shanxi is rich in mineral resources, surpassing the whole country, but it lacks mining machinery and relies mostly on human labor, which is time-consuming and laborious and difficult to achieve complete results. Now, the factory's machinery can be used to transform mining machinery to develop Shanxi's coal and iron to relieve people's livelihood and promote the future construction of northern ports. This is the second point. Our country's industry is still in the handicraft era. To revitalize it in the future, the first step is to use machinery. Now, the factory's machinery can be used to manufacture various industrial machines, and the various industrial plans in the second part of the Premier's industrial plan can be gradually implemented. The problem of people's livelihood can also be easily solved. This is the third point. The construction of the Datong-Puzhou Railway has been proposed for a long time, but it has not yet been realized because of the limitation of capital. It is difficult to purchase machinery, and there are no funds to purchase equipment. In today's environment of poor people and exhausted wealth, if even a rail or a spike must be purchased from abroad, it can be asserted that it is not easy to build. However, this road is of great importance to the development of commerce, mining, and industry, the progress of culture and education in Shanxi Province, and it is urgent to repair it. Now, the Datong-Puzhou Railway machinery and rails can be manufactured using the factory, and the cost of the iron-producing area in Shanxi can be reduced, and the process will be easier. It will also be a considerable supplement to the future construction of various routes in the fourth part of the fourth plan of the Premier's industrial plan. This is the fourth point. To sum up the above points, converting the factory into a manufacturing plant for agricultural tools, mining machinery, various industrial machinery, Datong-Puzhou Railway machinery, and rails is the most urgent task today. As for whether the factories should be manufactured separately or merged into one factory, the planning can be entrusted to experts in the future. We hereby reiterate the previous request based on the environment of Shanxi and the current needs of our country. We implore your council to transfer it to the National Government and order the Shanxi Provincial Government to handle it immediately, and we will be waiting for orders with great anticipation."</p>

<p>Former Pizhou County Magistrate Arrested in Suzhou: Wang Jiatian, the former magistrate of Pizhou County, was impeached by Wang Xipeng and Chen Kuiyi, citizens of the county, to the Provincial Government and the High Court for owing 36,000 yuan in public funds. The Provincial Government issued an order to dismiss him. Wang did not clear up the handover when he left office, and the Provincial Government issued an arrest warrant. As for Wang Xipeng and others suing in the High Court, Wang Jiatian was suspected of counter-revolution. Prosecutor Zhu Jun of the High Procuratorate has repeatedly summoned him for investigation and released him on bail. Wang Xipeng and others telegraphed the High Procuratorate again on the 23rd of this month, requesting that it be handled according to law. Prosecutor Zhu of the High Procuratorate originally scheduled to summon Wang Jiatian to the case for investigation on the afternoon of the 24th. After Wang received the summons, he arrived in Suzhou the next day. When he arrived at the case for interrogation on the afternoon of the 24th, he was still released on bail. Unexpectedly, the original accusers, Wang Xipeng and Chen Kuiyi, learned of the investigation date and followed him to Suzhou. When Wang Jiatian left the court at the gate of the High Court on the afternoon of the 24th, they stepped forward and grabbed Wang. Liu Fengshan, the policeman on duty at the station, saw this and inquired about the cause and effect, so he took them to the station. After a brief interrogation by Fang Ziqing, a patrol officer from the Fifth Branch of the Second Bureau, he immediately prepared a document and sent it to the Second Branch for transfer to the Public Security Bureau for verification.</p>
<p>Gao Ying's Opium Trafficking Case Opens Today: Gao Ying, the former Vice Consul in San Francisco, his wife Gao Liao, and his secretary Sun Yuan, appealed to the Supreme Court against the second-instance judgment of the High Court for trafficking in opium.

<p>The Rampant Situation of the River Pirates in Northern Jiangsu: After the fighting between the river pirates gathered along the coast of Northern Jiangsu, there are now three factions, Yan Zhenling, Zhong Zhaokui, and Fu Damaizi, with more than 500 bandits. Lusi is their lair. In addition to hijacking merchant ships, the bandits also窜 to various places along the river and sea to kidnap and extort ransoms. Recently, with the fishing season approaching in the counties of Tong, Ru, Hai, and Qi, the bandits have been demanding flag license fees from fishermen. This year, each ship must pay 120 yuan per month. Because the bandits are divided into three factions, they demand money at the same time, and the fishermen cannot afford it. They dare not go to sea. The Gu Yu peak season is coming soon, which is especially important to the fishermen's livelihood for the year. They have sent representatives to appeal to the province for the rapid implementation of measures to protect the fishing season.</p>

<p>Special Item</p>
<h3 id="e75">Explanatory Memorandum on the Proposal to Reduce Provincial Areas <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Our country's provincial system originated in the Yuan Dynasty. It was not intended to be profound, but only to facilitate military affairs and was a temporary arrangement. The Ming and Qing dynasties followed it, and the Republic of China followed the old system, which has become cumbersome and extensive. People have discussed it in great detail. This is indeed an important issue in our country's administrative system. Now that the military has been pacified and political tutelage has begun, if we want to improve administrative efficiency, we must re-examine the provincial areas and reduce the area. The reasons are listed as follows:</p>
<p>First, the territory is vast. The size of our country's provinces is unmatched in the world. Hebei Province is larger than the sum of England and Wales. Sichuan Province is larger than the three islands of Japan. Compared with Zhejiang Province, which has a very small area, it is still larger than Belgium and the Netherlands. Even a county's territory is larger than that of a country in Europe or Central and South America. The whip is too long to reach, and governance is crude. Although the provincial government has the power to command and supervise, in fact, the issuance of orders relies on a piece of paper. Whether the counties implement the orders is unknown. The results of the implementation are even more unknowable. The advantages and disadvantages of the place, the economic decline, are even more ignorant. The provincial government suffers from the lack of effective command, and the counties feel that the feelings of the lower levels cannot reach the upper levels. Therefore, even if there are good plans for various important policies such as autonomy, education, industry, and transportation, they cannot be implemented. This is one reason why the provincial area must be reduced.</p>
<p>Second, transportation is congested. Although our country's culture is very old, the development of material civilization is very late. In terms of transportation, except for a few provinces in the northeast and southeast, which have railways that can be reached, or also have the advantage of shipping, the 28 provinces and Mongolia and Tibet have few railways. In the northwest, such as Gansu, Qinghai, and Ningxia, and in the southwest, such as Sichuan, Xikang, Guizhou, and Guangxi, there is not even a foot of railway, and there are few rivers. Mongolia and Tibet are even more isolated. The means of transportation rely solely on the ancient mule carts, camels, sedan chairs, and civilian ships. Because of the vastness of the territory and the many mountains, it takes four or five days or ten days from the county to the countryside, and it takes months from the province to the county. Even if the government has the determination to work hard, it will never have the effect of making arms and fingers work effectively. Compared with the civilized countries of the world, where government orders are urgent, and transportation arrives in the morning and evening, it is like heaven and earth. This is the second reason why the provincial area must be reduced.</p>
<p>Third, the situations are different. Within a province, languages are not common, desires are different, customs are different, interests are different, and economies are suspended. In the same province, the east, west, north, and south, interests run counter to each other. Therefore, if the provincial government implements policies uniformly, there will be sighs of cold, heat, rain, and rain. If it adapts to local conditions, it will feel the pain of cutting feet to fit shoes. This is the third reason why the provincial area must be reduced.</p>
<p>Fourth, the boundaries are too deep. The people of our country have a deep-rooted view of boundaries, and provincial boundaries are one aspect. Since the Republic of China, this trend has not changed. When an organ changes a long history, many fellow villagers celebrate. If provincial籍 are different, even talented people will be rejected. This is not only true of politics, but also in commerce and society. The boundaries are clear, like a chasm. Those who argue that the Chinese people's intelligence and talent are no less than those of Westerners, but lack a spirit of cooperation, thus reducing the efficiency of doing things, attribute the lack of cooperative spirit to provincial boundaries. This is the fourth reason why the provincial area must be reduced.</p>
<p>Fifth, military separatism. The vastness of the territory and the congestion of transportation have been described above. Unfortunately, ambitious people arise, holding military power, residing in the provincial capital. The military strength and wealth of a province are equal to that of a country in the world, so it can confront the central government. The authority of the central government loses its control. For the past 20 years, warlord separatism and internal strife have been cyclical, plunging the people into misery, and being a great obstacle to the national revolution, not or not because of this. Now that the disease is settled, it is necessary to change the strings and change the chapter. This is the fifth reason why the provincial area must be reduced.</p>
<p>The above reasons, the first four are chronic diseases, and the latter one is a new disease. The first four are ill with numbness, and the latter one is ill in the heart. In short, chronic diseases, new diseases, numbness, and diseases in the heart all need to be treated as one. The humble view of the pivot is that reducing the provincial area is a good prescription for the symptoms. In the past, France suffered from being too large, difficult to govern, too deep in boundaries, and military separatism, which was roughly the same as the situation in our country today. During the Great Revolution, it resolutely abolished 40 provinces and changed them to 87 states. As a result, governance was meticulous, and the meridians were connected. It has continued to this day, and all wastes have been raised. The party is the only party for revolution and nation-building. Today is the beginning of the implementation of political tutelage. With the spirit of decades of struggle, we seek the reform of the political region, so that the central government and the provinces can have equal power, and the local area can implement autonomy. There is no other way. The method is to reduce the area of the provinces, divide each province into two or three, examine the topography of mountains and rivers, convenient transportation, financial surpluses and deficits, population density, and economic abundance as the criteria for division, so as to make adjustments properly, make orders agile, cut long and make up for short, and do not have partial dryness, so as to meet the requirements of the times and plan the improvement of politics. Furthermore, the national government affairs are numerous and mixed. If it is appropriate to concentrate power in the central government, if it is appropriate to decentralize power to the provinces, if it is appropriate for the central government and the provinces to co-govern and cooperate, our country's central and local powers are not divided, which is a major disease of political image. Between the two, there are often disagreements or mutual evasion. Disagreements and evasions are caused by all kinds of abuses, and government affairs are abandoned. Some say that the division of such powers is an important issue in the future constitution, and there is no place for branch changes. They do not know the difference between the constitution and the non-constitution, not in whether the central and local powers are divided, but in whether the division is fixed. It is recorded in the constitution, so it has robustness. If it is amended, it must go through serious procedures. If it is not recorded in the constitution, it has fluidity and can be modified at any time in consideration of the situation and political image. This should also be stipulated at the same time as the provincial area reduction plan. I hereby give a supplementary explanation to the right, Wu Chaochu.</p>

<h3 id="e76">The Gold Profit Source Case Negotiations Gradually Become Serious <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (CMSNC) Has Requested the Government</p>
<p>to Cancel the Deed of the Sande (Three Virtues) Church</p>
<p>If the Sande Church Does Not Realize the Situation Very Soon,</p>
<p>It Should Bear Full Responsibility for Any Accidents That Occur</p>
<p>Regarding the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Gold Profit Source case, because of the Sande Church's Father Hsia-ch'i's (Xavier) rude attitude, breaking promises and reneging on agreements, and withdrawing its agreement to sell the pier to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, after the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company sent a letter, in addition to replying to the Sande Church, it also sent a letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to seriously negotiate. If the church still wants to hoard, please ask the government to check the files and fundamentally cancel the deed held by the church. The details of each situation are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Respectfully informing you that our company and the French Catholic Sande Church have had disputes over land rental, and have repeatedly been involved in litigation, mediation, negotiation, and arbitration. Last December, we sent a letter to your ministry requesting assistance in negotiations and sending a note to the French envoy, ordering the French consul in Shanghai to strictly order the Sande Church to quickly resolve the matter. Our company believes that in this matter, based on diplomatic history, we are justified and will never lightly abandon our national rights or submit to the biased judgment of the French Concession Mixed Court. Furthermore, due to the discovery of new evidence, we have already filed a retrial with the French Concession Mixed Court. On our company's side, we have already determined our steps, and we must either continue the lease quickly or purchase it at a fair price. However, the French Consul General expressed sincerity and intended to maintain Sino-French relations, secretly preventing the Mixed Court from executing the judgment, and exerted extraordinary effort. In addition, prominent Shanghai gentry and merchants also mediated, hoping to reach a peaceful resolution. Our company, in view of the kindness of the outside world and the sincerity of the French Consul, did not want to immediately take extreme measures, and waited quietly for mediation. Recently, according to the mediators and the French Consul, they said that they had reached an agreement with the Sande Church, and our company could purchase the land at a fair price. They also instructed our company to send someone to negotiate the purchase price with the Sande Church. Our company, respecting the opinions of the mediators and the French Consul, immediately sent attorney Kao Shuo, who had previously served as an arbitrator, to formally represent our company and personally went to the Sande Church to meet with the responsible father. Unexpectedly, the father expressed that he was still stubborn and still insisted on his high price of 330,000 taels, with little concession, resulting in no result. Our company, forced to do so, turned to inquire with the mediators, who were surprised by the father's fickleness and only urged us to send a letter to the church to counteroffer. Our company, respecting the public opinion, sent a public letter to the church a few days ago, counteroffering 200,000 taels to purchase the land. The church has not yet replied, but based on our company's observation, the church may not have genuine remorse. If it still deliberately hoards and does not concede, our company will have to, based on diplomatic history and the original text of the contract, announce to the public and let the people judge right and wrong. At the same time, we will request the government to check the files and fundamentally cancel the deed held by the church. At that time, if the public, aroused by justice, attacks the church, forcibly seizes property, unreasonably invalidates the contract, and exposes all acts of engaging in business for profit under the guise of missionary work, and an accident occurs, harming Sino-French relations, then the responsibility for opening the gap should be borne by the church, and it cannot be said that our company intentionally provoked the incident improperly. After all, the diplomatic history of the previous Qing Dynasty for eight years does not allow the church to recklessly ignore it. Therefore, we specially request your ministry to send a note to the French envoy in China, ordering the French Consul in Shanghai to strictly order the Sande Church to fulfill the provisions of the land deed, not to hinder our company's use, continue the lease, or respect the mediator's arbitration and sell at a fair price, so as to avoid inciting a storm and affecting diplomatic relations. If your ministry believes that sending a note to the French envoy is too complicated, please inform your office in Shanghai to advise the French Consul and supervise the church to quickly and fairly settle the matter, and not to be stubborn again. Fortunately, the French Consul has expressed goodwill from the beginning and has repeatedly acted as a mediator. Now, if we issue a serious warning, he may use it as an excuse to force the church. The matter concerns national rights and national navigation. We earnestly request your ministry to vigorously preside over it, hoping for an early resolution and to achieve a final victory, then our gratitude will be boundless. All the details of the case and the key points for negotiation are hereby communicated. We hope you will investigate and reply. Respectfully addressed to Minister Wang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (March 19th)</p>
<p>Kao Shuo's Report to General Manager Li: Respectfully informing you that I have received a letter from attorney Bahe on March 18th, stating that according to the Sande Church, your attorney's letter to Father Hsia-ch'i, the manager of the church, on the 17th of this month, has been reviewed, and he has been entrusted to reply as follows: According to the letter, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is willing to use 200,000 Shanghai Common Regulations silver dollars to purchase all the rights to the pier and appurtenances of the Gold Profit Source pier, French Register A, No. 69. After investigation, the price offered differs by 190,000 taels from the price quoted by our client on November 3, 1930. Our client believes that it is difficult to approach the matter and there is no need to continue negotiations. Therefore, we specially convey this formally on their behalf. All of our client's price of 390,000 taels for selling the land of French Register A, No. 69 to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company on November 3, 1930, is now unconditionally withdrawn. Please investigate and inform the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. I hereby request your approval for handling. Furthermore, on the 13th of this month, I was ordered to represent you and accompanied Mr. Zhang Ji-xian, a member of the French Municipal Council, to the father's residence to discuss the purchase price of the land. We went sincerely, with the aim of settling the matter. We hoped that the case would be concluded soon. However, the father spoke rudely, referring to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company as thieves and robbers. After speaking in French, fearing that I did not understand, he repeated it in Shanghai dialect. I immediately refuted him, saying that offering a price for a sale, how could there be such absurd arguments? The church is asking for 390,000 taels, without any concessions, is it possible to force a sale? Is a counteroffer robbery? Moreover, the father should abide by Catholic rules, how can he arbitrarily scold people? The matter concerns public insult. How should this be handled? I await your instructions. As for the Father of the Sande Church, who previously sent a letter willing to sell the land, and now, upon a counteroffer, immediately withdraws it completely, it is very close to child's play, disregarding Sino-French relations, and clearly failing to live up to the French Consul General's hard work in mediating this case. Our side seems to be unable to allow this lightly. I hereby state this. Respectfully addressed to Commissioner Li of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. Attorney Kao Shuo, Seal, March 21st.</p>
<p>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Reply to the Sande Church: Respectfully replying to the letter from attorney Bahe on March 18th, representing your church, regarding your church's previous letter on November 3, 1930, agreeing to sell the Gold Profit Source pier at Registered Love No. 69 to our company, because the counteroffer differs from the price requested, it is considered difficult to approach the matter, there is no need to continue negotiations, and it will be unconditionally withdrawn, please inform, etc. After investigation, the pier on this land was originally built by our company with huge sums of money, and later ceded to your church. The deed states that it must be leased to our company for use and cannot be leased to others. The details of the negotiations between the Prime Minister's Office of the previous Qing Dynasty and the Shanghai Daotai with the French Minister and the French Consul General are all on file and can be easily reviewed. In this case, out of respect for Consul General Gan's hard work in mediation, your church formally agreed to sell, and both parties are negotiating, with various authorities in the French Concession mediating, hoping to achieve a satisfactory result. Unexpectedly, our company negotiated in good faith, but Father Hsia-ch'i, the manager of your church, acted arbitrarily and recklessly, arbitrarily slandering and even contradicting himself, which is very close to child's play. Our company believes that Father Hsia-ch'i's actions intentionally hinder the transportation of the National Government and will infringe upon the friendship between China and France. If your church does not realize the situation soon and follow a proper path, our company will have to take necessary measures. Any other unexpected events that occur as a result, the responsibility will be fully borne by your church. I hereby send this letter to your church for investigation. March 24th.</p>

<h3 id="e78">Various Industry Groups Discussed Unifying Weights and Measures Yesterday <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Six Measures Decided</p>
<p>To Be Implemented on July 1st</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, under the order of the Bureau of Social Affairs, convened representatives from various industry groups to discuss the unification of weights and measures. The details of yesterday's meeting are recorded below:</p>
<p>Representatives Present: Silk Factory Industry Wang Xiaolai, Southern Goods Industry Zheng Chengqing, New Medicine Industry Sun Choucheng, Flour Factory Gu Xinyi, Cotton Cloth Industry Chen Songyuan, Egg Factory Industry Cui Jinggong, Clothing Industry Wu Zhihao, Fresh Meat Association Shen Xie, Fur Industry Jiang Zhigang, and more than 60 others. Wang Xiaolai was elected as chairman.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: The chairman first gave a report, roughly stating: Today's meeting is based on the instructions of the Bureau of Social Affairs to discuss the matter of unifying weights and measures. Its meaning is like the three slogans in our country's commercial customs: fair transactions, no deception of the elderly or children, and unified and unwavering. But how can this be achieved? There must be a unified standard. In the past, our country's weights and measures were very uneven. Scales had sixteen ounces, ten ounces, and eight ounces. Rulers had sea rulers and Suzhou rulers. If they are not unified, not only will disputes often occur, but morally it is also very incompatible. Therefore, unifying the national weights and measures system has become an urgent matter, and the goal is to make the country consistent and in line with the international metric system.</p>
<p>Representatives' Speeches: Wu Huanru, the representative of the Bureau of Social Affairs, said: In the past, under the old system, weights and measures often caused disputes, and the people felt it was very difficult. In recent years, the government has been seeking to unify weights and measures, researching and improving methods, and establishing municipal weights and measures based on the international metric system to facilitate the promotion of the whole country. The city has established a weights and measures verification office, which is now equipped. It will register stores in the city that manufacture weights and measures and instruct them to manufacture new instruments in the future to achieve unification. Now, if representatives of various industry associations have any insightful opinions, please express them fully for discussion.</p>
<p>Verification Report: Zhou Zanming, the representative of the Shanghai Weights and Measures Verification Office, reported that the current unification of the weights and measures system is being handled by the National Weights and Measures Bureau urging various provinces and cities. The provincial government is responsible for the construction department, and the municipal government is responsible for the social affairs bureau. The implementation method of the Weights and Measures Verification Office is divided into five points: (1) Investigate the usage habits of various industries. (2) Promote the use of new instruments. (3) Verify the weights and measures of manufacturers and sellers. (4) Inspect the weights and measures already used by various industries. (5) Guide the use of new instruments. (6) Prohibit the use of old instruments.</p>
<p>Measures Decided: After discussion by the representatives, the following measures were decided: (1) July 1st was decided as the date for promoting the new system in the city. (Before the deadline for unification in the city) On the one hand, notify the members of each industry. On the other hand, register with the verification office. (2) Notify each industry to report the types and quantities of new instruments needed. (3) The verification office, based on the reports of various industries, urges the manufacturing factories to manufacture as much as possible to meet the needs. (4) Compare the new and old instruments, revise the prices, and compile simple conversion tables for distribution to various industries. (5) Assist the verification office in carrying out inspection affairs. (6) Execute other matters concerning the unification of weights and measures assigned by the Bureau of Social Affairs or the verification office.</p>

<h3 id="e87">Ministry of Finance Explains Key Points of Collecting Business Tax <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Divides the Boundaries of Exemption from Business Tax</p>
<p>Specifies the Affixing of Stamps to Business Licenses</p>
<p>In order to promote business tax and prevent various disputes from arising during implementation, the Ministry of Finance specially telegraphed chambers of commerce in various provinces and cities yesterday to explain everything. The telegram is recorded below: For the matter of consultation and implementation: An investigation found that the provinces and cities are implementing the abolition of Likin, and are holding business tax to compensate for the case. The ministry has reported to the executive yuan to approve the general outline of business tax collection and supplementary measures and ordered the provinces and cities to comply with it. However, article 1 of the business tax general outline stipulates that companies that have paid income tax to the central government and those that have been collected special surtaxes by the central government are excluded. Article 1 of the supplementary measures stipulates that all banks, special companies, and tobacco and alcohol industries that have been levied license taxes are excluded. In addition, how much stamp duty should be affixed to business licenses used for business tax is also not provided in previous regulations. All of these should be clarified so that both tax collectors and taxpayers can follow the rules. The five explanation measures are listed below: (1) Factories or companies that have paid unified tax or special consumption tax shall not be levied business tax by the provinces, but merchants and stores selling and selling them shall still be levied business tax. (2) Provinces shall not levy business tax on those who specialize in the salt industry and have been levied salt tax by the central government, but stores selling miscellaneous goods that also operate retail salt shall still be levied business tax. (3) Provinces shall not levy business tax on those who specialize in the tobacco and alcohol industry and have been levied tobacco and alcohol license fees by the central government, but stores selling goods that also sell tobacco and alcohol shall still be levied business tax. (4) Stamp tax tickets shall be affixed to business licenses. Those with capital above 500 yuan shall affix 5 jiao per certificate, and those with capital below 500 yuan shall affix 1 jiao per certificate. (5) The central government shall levy exchange tax on exchanges, and the provinces shall not levy business tax. In addition to consulting, the above measures should be consulted for reference.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government has been working hard since the establishment of the Business Tax Preparation Office.

They are now rushing to print forms and will begin the investigation in early next month. The deadline is one month. It is rumored that the formal collection of business tax can be officially started in early May.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Minhang Chamber of Commerce Appeals for Correction of Business Tax <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>The Minhang Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai County submitted a document to the Ministry of Finance yesterday regarding business tax, requesting corrections. The abstract of the original presentation is recorded below: The presentation is to appeal for the correction of the regulations on business tax collection in Jiangsu and its implementation details, which exceed the outline, in order to conform to the precedent and alleviate merchants' difficulties. We believe that our country's industry and commerce have suffered from the harsh demands of Likin, and they have felt pain for more than 80 years. The central government, realizing the people's sentiments, resolutely decided to implement the abolition of Likin throughout the country on the 20th of this year. Hundreds of millions of people feel this virtue together. After the Likin is abolished, the income of the localities has suddenly decreased, and the budget is acutely insufficient. The provinces have held business tax to compensate for this. However, we believe that the abolition of Likin originally intended to eliminate bad policies and renew the people. The quality of the new tax system is of great importance to the interests of merchants and people. At the beginning of this founding, we must not ignore it. Therefore, we will present several points of disagreement between the business tax regulations of Jiangsu Province and its implementation details and the Ministry's regulations to our Minister for consideration: (1) The tax rate should be revised. (2) The taxation of goods should be changed. (3) Goods that have paid central taxes should be excluded. (4) Grains and firewood should be exempt from tax. (5) The method of collection should be as convenient as possible. (6) The bonus for the fine of 50% should be considered. (7) The business tax of the brokerage industry should be expressly exempted. The above seven items are only a few of the major ones. They are all related to the skin pain of merchants. Likin harms merchants, but there is still a day of abolition. Once the business tax regulations are approved and filed, there is no hope of cancellation. At the beginning of the creation, if the planning is slightly careless, the future of industry and commerce will be greatly affected.</p>

<p>Directors of Beijing, Shanghai, Jinan and Ping Assigned</p>
<p>The two airplanes of Eurasian Aviation, Eurasian First and Eurasian Second, have been flying north from Shanghai to Beiping for test flights since the 15th of this month. On the morning of the 20th, they flew from Ping to Doron to find an airport. In the afternoon, they returned to Ping and placed the site at Nanyuan. In about a few days, they will return to Shanghai to report everything. The third and fourth Eurasian airplanes also started test flights at Hongqiao Airport at 3 pm the day before yesterday. The third airplane flew very low and circled Shanghai for 30 minutes before returning to the field to land. The fourth airplane flew very high for about two minutes and then safely stopped. As a result, all four airplanes brought by Germany performed well in the test flights. The directors of the four stations in Beijing, Shanghai, Jinan and Ping have also been appointed, namely Yang Qing, the director of the Shanghai station, Gao Jieshan, the director of the Nanjing station, Jiang Da, the director of the Jinan station, and Zhang Yunkai, the director of the Beiping station. The candidates for the directors of the Doron and Manchuria stations are being sought. According to Mr. Liang Mutang, an engineer of the Eurasian Company, the radio stations along the route have not yet been installed, so it is difficult to determine whether the official opening on April 1st can be achieved. The flight time, ticket prices, company operating rules, postal transport contracts, and staff salaries must be discussed and decided by the board of directors after Li Jingzong and Shi Mide return to Shanghai from Ping.

<h3 id="e91">China Aviation Corporation Investigates National Aviation Talent <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>The company held a board meeting yesterday.</p>
<p>The China Aviation Corporation held a board meeting the day before yesterday (the 24th) at the residence of Liu Shufan, the Director-General of the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau. A total of six Chinese and American directors attended. The main points discussed were: (1) Actively</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>deploying airports along the Beijing-Ping, Wuhan-Yichang lines to facilitate air navigation; (2) Recent assignment of American personnel: (A) Bender was appointed as Vice Chairman; (B) Hamilton and Saez were appointed as Directors; (C) Smith was appointed as Inspector; (3) Investigating aviation talent nationwide. The last question was discussed for a long time during the meeting. According to He Jiwu, the General Manager of the company, speaking to a reporter from the Guowen News Agency yesterday, China's aviation industry is booming, and the development of air transport is of great importance to the future of domestic transportation. Recruiting specialists is particularly important. Taking the company as an example, it currently employs six American pilots and ten Chinese pilots. This is sufficient for the time being, but after the Beijing-Ping, Wuhan-Yichang lines start formally carrying passengers, and the Shanghai-Guangdong line, which is currently being planned, will also start soon, the need for talent is very high. The Northeast, and provinces such as Pingjin, Hasui, Min, Guang, and Gui are not lacking in aviation talent, but our country has never had a detailed investigation and statistics, resulting in talent being buried and unheard of. When the aviation industry needs pilots, it often spends huge salaries to hire foreigners. Currently, the Chinese and American directors of the company all agree to search for Chinese aviation talent, and have entrusted aviation offices in various cities to conduct investigations, expecting to review and employ them when expanding in the future. The company's investigation letter to aviation offices in various cities is recorded below: Respectfully, although the development of our country's aviation industry has been temporary, the progress is truly surprising. It is a pity that new talent is often used by other states. This is due to the lack of domestic talent, but also because the usual inquiries are not thorough, and communication is rare, leading to this. In view of this, our office intends to conduct a large-scale investigation, collecting information on the origins, ages, experiences, etc., of all domestic aviation specialists, so as to facilitate communication and contact, which will be of some benefit to the future of domestic aviation. We have long admired your office for having established regulations for the aviation industry and understanding aviation talent like the back of your hand. We intend to attach a form with this letter, and hope that you will conduct a detailed investigation within your jurisdiction and show it to us for reference, in the spirit of public service. Sincerely, to: Aviation offices in Nanjing, Chongqing, Kunming, Changsha, Guangzhou, Taiyuan, Shenyang, etc.</p>

<p>All members must submit opinions on the Banking Law by the deadline.</p>
<p>The accounting period will remain at the end of June and the end of December.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Banking Association held a general meeting at its clubhouse at No. 4 Hong Kong Road at 2:00 PM yesterday. All 24 members attended. After the meeting began, the following were discussed: (1) Members will submit their written opinions on the newly revised Banking Law of the Legislative Yuan within three days, which will be collected by the Banking Association and forwarded to the central government. Because the Banking Law is greatly related to the banking industry itself, it must be carefully studied. (2) Regarding the accounting date, in order for the banking industry to respect the national calendar, the end of June and the end of December have always been used as the accounting period, and there is no need to change it at present. The above two items were unanimously approved, and the meeting adjourned at around 4:00 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Increase in Third-Class Passenger Tickets on Two Railways Difficult to Change <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Ministry of Railways replies to letter from Municipal Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>The Ministry of Railways replied to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday regarding the request to exempt the increase in third-class passenger tickets on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railways, stating that it was difficult to make a sudden change. The original letter stated, "Regarding your association's telegram on behalf of Xiantai, regarding the increase in freight rates on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railways, please allow the exemption of the increase in the price of third-class passenger tickets to benefit the common people, etc., which shows your concern for railway administration and consideration for people's livelihoods. However, it is found that the current price of gold is expensive, and not only the railway suffers huge losses, but also all businesses are affected equally. Your association should be able to understand this situation, without the need for detailed explanation. This increase in freight rates on the two railways is actually to make up for business losses, which is a last resort. Moreover, the transportation surcharges on the two railways have also been limited by the Ministry, and the price increase for third-class passenger tickets is very small. After the increase, it is still low compared to other railways. During the period of railway financial difficulties, it is still a consideration for people's livelihoods in making up for losses. Now that the case has been implemented, it is even more difficult to make a sudden change. Approved as before, reply accordingly, and hope to follow the original instructions," etc.</p>

<p>To be handled in conjunction with the Pacification Supervisor's Office</p>
<p>Each fisherman in the coastal area outside Wusongkou, as the fishing season approaches, each fishing boat prepares to set sail for fishing. However, in recent days, pirates have been rampant, and there have been incidents of forced donations. Therefore, the fishermen have been hesitant to move forward. After consultation, it was decided to send representatives to the province to petition. It is now known that the representatives returned to Song yesterday. The province stated that it is very concerned about the fishing season in the coastal area outside Songkou. The insecurity of the sea not only damages fishermen and merchants, but also hinders national tax revenue.

<p>Summoned for questioning this afternoon</p>
<p>Labor representatives put forward conditions yesterday</p>
<p>After the Sanxin Yarn Factory on Yangshupu Road announced its sale, the Ministry of Industry and the Municipal Government ordered the Municipal Social Bureau to investigate and handle the matter. Yesterday, the bureau issued a notice to the labor representatives and Rong Zongjing, and scheduled a questioning session first for this afternoon to facilitate mediation. The situation obtained yesterday is recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Authorities mediate After receiving the news of the sale of the Sanxin Yarn Factory, the Municipal Social Bureau, because it is greatly related to the future of the Chinese textile industry, and it is necessary to pay attention to who it is sold to, sent staff to investigate thoroughly. Later, they received instructions from the Municipal Government and telegrams from the Ministry of Industry, all ordering investigation and handling, and the labor representatives repeatedly petitioned for relief. Therefore, Xu Zhi, a staff member of the Third Section, was designated to summon the cotton textile industry union of the Third Special Zone, Sheng Zecheng, the owner of the Sanxin Yarn Factory, and Rong Zongjing, the buyer of the machinery factory, for questioning at 1:00 PM today, in order to start mediation. The notices have been issued separately yesterday.</p>
<p>Notice to the union Yesterday, the Municipal Social Bureau, due to being ordered to handle the sale of the Sanxin Yarn Factory, issued a notice to the cotton textile industry union of the Third Special Zone, instructing all workers to wait for mediation. The petition was submitted, stating that the Sanxin Yarn Factory was being sold, requesting that severance pay be issued to maintain livelihood, etc. All were aware. Respectfully, immediately instruct them to wait for mediation, and do not obstruct the old and new reception, causing disputes. This is an important notice.</p>
<p>Order to Rong Zongjing Yesterday, the Social Bureau issued an order to Rong Zongjing, the general manager of Shenxin Yarn Factory, the buyer of the machinery of the Sanxin Yarn Factory, stating, "To order compliance, the Municipal Government issued Order No. 7683, based on the petition submitted by the cotton textile industry union of the Third Special Zone, stating that the Sanxin Yarn Factory was being sold, requesting that relief be provided and that remuneration be issued, etc. The deputy petition was forwarded, ordering immediate investigation and handling, and reporting, etc. Upon receiving this, while the investigation and handling were underway, a telegram from the Ministry of Industry was received, ordering immediate investigation and handling of the case. It was found that the factory had been established for a long time, and the employees had served for several years, or even dozens of years. Once the factory foundation is sold, the foundation is shaken, and the public is panicked. It is a matter of course. In addition to persuading the factory employees not to obstruct the old and new reception, and ordering them to wait for mediation, the reason for the order is that, in addition to submitting separate reports and instructions to the union, it is necessary to order compliance. This order."</p>
<p>Workers' conditions Yesterday, the cotton textile industry union of the Third Special Zone held a temporary meeting and put forward three requirements, and submitted them to the Social Bureau for review and handling. It was submitted, stating that the Sanxin Yarn Factory disregarded the livelihoods of the workers and rashly closed down and sold the factory. Now the conditions are put forward, and submitted to your bureau. It is requested that the factory owner, Sheng Zecheng, be ordered to fulfill the requirements as soon as possible, so as to comply with government laws and protect the survival of workers.

<h3 id="e97">Second Plenary Session of Seamen Postponed <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Central Executive Committee's instruction has arrived</p>
<p>Since the reorganization committee of the Seamen's Union Federation, has prepared the affairs of the union, it is urgently necessary to convene a national congress of representatives to elect executive and supervisory committee members. The date of the congress has been set for April 1. The Shanghai branch also plans to convene a city-wide representative meeting before the plenary session. After submitting reports to the central government for review, the General Association received Instruction No. 4881 from the Central Executive Committee yesterday, stating, "Having received the report, it is known that the organizational regulations for special trade unions were abolished by the central government a long time ago. The new organizational regulations for seamen and civilian ship crew members have also been transferred by the central government to the National Government for the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Communications to consult and formulate as soon as possible. However, the new regulations have not yet been announced. The association's request to convene a national congress of representatives to elect executive and supervisory committee members is difficult to base on. Wait for the new regulations to be announced before reorganizing, otherwise, it may violate the central government's regulations, etc." After receiving the instructions yesterday, the General Association has informed the Shanghai branch to temporarily suspend the convening of the Second Plenary Session of the National Seamen.</p>
<h3 id="e98">The Two Railway Unions in the Midst of Reorganization <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>The Union Reorganization Committee issued a letter to members</p>
<p>The reorganization committee of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Unions, having received repeated orders from the central government that the railway is an industrial union and can only establish one complete union, and cannot divide it into car service, machinery, or other names, decided after 64 reorganization committee meetings to reorganize all existing unions into branch offices. After the reorganization is completed, the council members of the two railway unions will be elected by the representative assembly. Yesterday, Zou Keqin, the director of the guidance section, summoned the representatives of various unions for talks and published the "Letter to All Members of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Unions on Reorganizing the Unions" to explain. The recording is as follows: "Fellow workers of the two railways, the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Unions are now starting to reorganize. Before the reorganization, the reasons for the reorganization should be explained to all workers, so as to avoid doubts and misunderstandings. For the sake of clarity, it is stated segment by segment as follows: (1) The general situation of the organization of the two railway unions in the past. In the past, worker groups were organized according to the organizational system set by the former Central People's Training Committee. In the vertical aspect, each union was established, and then the general union was produced. Not only were the two railways like this, but most other places were the same. Later, the central government abolished this organizational system, and the Union Law and the Union Law Enforcement Law were promulgated by the National Government one after another. Originally, they could be reorganized from scratch according to the laws and regulations, but because of the long-standing habits and too many doubts in the Union Law, looking around the country, the worker groups were still proceeding in the original way, and on the one hand, they were still hoping for the promulgation of the special trade union law, and the superiors never had specific methods to instruct. At this time of wandering and crossroads, at a loss, the association can only do its duty to actively reorganize the various unions of the two railways. At the same time, it also feels that the organization of the union is no different from the organization of the party department. They are all from the bottom up. No matter how the name changes in the future, the basic organization must first seek to be sound. Fortunately, we did this and got the unity of the workers of different professions in various parts. Now, there are more than ten individual organizations of the union that have been established one after another, and there are still several in the preparatory period. The general situation of the organization of the two railway unions in the past is roughly like this. (2) The basis for the reorganization. Article 6 of the Union Law states that only one union can be established for workers in the same industry or workers in the same occupation in the same area. Article 2 of the Union Law Enforcement Law states that an organization that gathers workers of different occupations in the same enterprise is an industrial union, and an organization that gathers workers of the same occupation is an occupational union. The central government stipulates that the railway union is an industrial union, and the railway area is the scope from the beginning to the end of the line. There is no doubt in law that the two railways can establish one union. However, the already established unions have different duties and different systems. Mixed organizations are not only difficult in fact, but also may cause disputes. These difficulties are felt by comrades who guide the organization of railway unions. Recently, the central government also knows this actual situation and must find a way to remedy it. Therefore, it issued a simplified organizational rule for the branch offices of the railway union, but at the same time, it does not allow the various unions under the same enterprise to stand side by side, and must be reorganized according to law. We have this concrete plan, and all kinds of psychology that were formerly depressed and doubtful are gone. At the meeting of the reorganization committee, the plan to reorganize the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Unions was passed. (3) The significance of the reorganization. Workers join the union because the union can protect workers and seek benefits for workers. The reason why the union has this power is because it has the qualifications of a legal person. If it is not organized according to the laws and regulations of the union, the party department will of course stop it, and the government will not be able to guarantee it. Then, where can we get the qualifications of a legal person? The significance of reorganizing the union is to make the union legal, and to enable the legal union to protect workers and seek benefits for workers. Moreover, the reorganization does not have much change, but the names of the staff are different. The original organization is still preserved, and the original system is still maintained, so that the former scattered state of each separate state becomes a whole united "Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Unions" to maximize the obligations assumed by the union. (4) How to reorganize and the procedure of reorganization. The reorganization does not have much change. It has been said above that the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway should establish a union. Under the union, branch offices are established separately. The reorganization procedure is to first establish the various branch offices, and then elect representatives to produce directors and supervisors to formally establish the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Unions. At this time, all the procedures are completed. The highest party department certifies it and registers with the highest competent authority. Fellow workers, we need the whole union, especially the legal union. At the time of this reorganization, I hope everyone will work together and support it together," etc., etc.</p>
<h3 id="e99">San-Yi Coal Ball Factory Labor Dispute Resolved <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>The workers of the San-Yi Coal Ball Factory on Bansongyuan Road, because the factory was delayed in starting work and their livelihoods were in trouble, had no choice but to submit a report to the Social Bureau, requesting assistance. The bureau had instructed the factory to report the reasons for the suspension of work. More than a month has passed, but it has not been resolved. At 1:00 PM yesterday, the bureau held the third mediation session. The representatives of the capital side, Wang Jinchen and Li Xiangnan, the representatives of the coal and firewood industry union, Zheng Xiaotang and Xie Baoxing, and the chairman, Wang Bing, attended. After a long discussion, the labor and capital sides agreed to sign two items of the peace agreement: (1) The factory is allowed to dismiss 16 workers, including Ma Liansheng. The factory will give each of the listed workers a severance fee. As a result, the labor dispute in the factory was resolved.</p>

<p>Changsha Chamber of Commerce representatives continue to negotiate</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously requested the Jardine Matheson to compensate the Changsha Chamber of Commerce. When the Red Army captured Changsha, the ship company was unable to handle it and the goods stored in the warehouse were all looted. It is now known that the company has replied to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, stating, "Respectfully received the great letter. During the Communist Party's looting of Changsha in July last year, our company deeply regretted it. The looting of our company's Changsha warehouse, in fact, maintaining local order is the responsibility of the authorities. Before the arrival of the Red Army, there was early warning. Changsha merchants should have tried their best to take appropriate measures to protect their goods before the army withdrew. At that time, the situation was serious, and it was difficult for merchants to leave Changsha. Moreover, it was found in our company's books that some consignees had taken the goods away before the provincial capital was looted. Then, the Changsha merchants at that time already knew that the local turmoil was enough to endanger their goods. The responsibility that the merchants should bear should be recognized by everyone. Moreover, everything has been stipulated in our company's bill of lading terms. Our company's warehouse was unfortunately the first to be looted. The warehouses near Zou, which belong to other shipping companies, would have been unavoidable if foreign gunboats had not come out and interfered. Our company, as a shipping company, cannot protect the warehouse in the midst of turmoil. As for the authorities responsible for public security, they have stopped exercising their powers. Therefore, our company cannot be responsible for the losses that occurred at this time." It is heard that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has transferred the letter to the Changsha Chamber of Commerce for reference. At the same time, representatives of the Changsha Chamber of Commerce have personally gone to the company to negotiate on the basis of reason.</p>

<p>Shangyu: The Shangyu Native Place Association in Shanghai held an executive committee meeting yesterday afternoon at 4 o'clock. Attendees included Wang Zhixiang, Liu Xiaotian, Zhang Jieshou, Gong Zhijian, Wang Guoquan, Ye Qiding, Lu Yongju, and sixteen others. Chairman Wang Zhixiang presided over the meeting. The Director of Documentation, Liu Xiaotian, reported on: (1) the situation of the Shangyu delegations in Shanghai, who are seeking back the right of ownership of the Xiaonanhui academic property. Shangyu County’s Xixiang Xiaonanhui Tianen No. 2 sandy field has always been Shangyu’s academic property, and is recorded in the official records. Years ago, Feng Xueshu, Feng Xue, and Feng Meiyan of Shaoxing County, under the assumed name of Yu Shengjie, colluded with Tong Rong, the director of the Shaoxing County Reclamation Bureau, to acquire the property through a scheme, illegally occupying it. Shangyu legal entities have repeatedly telegraphed the Zhejiang Provincial Government's Civil Affairs, Finance, and Education Departments, as well as the Central Executive Yuan, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Education, requesting that the matter be kept on file. Later, Tong Rong was dismissed and investigated for bribery in this case. The Ministry of Finance, deeply aware of the insider information of the sandy field, stopped issuing permits, turning it into an unresolved case. Unexpectedly, the Fengs, relying on their power, acted recklessly, recently reclaiming the land and even dispatched Shaoxing police to demonstrate beyond the border. The Shangyu public and legal entities, having reached their breaking point, organized the Shangyu Support Association to Reclaim the Xiaonanhui Academic Property, appointing Yu Shiqing, Liu Enxi, Bei Zairan, Zhu Yuntai, Yao Xiantang, Huang Langyuan, and others as representatives. On March 15th, they first petitioned the Zhejiang Provincial Government. The Shangyu Native Place Association in Hangzhou also sent representatives to join the petition delegation to jointly petition in Beijing. On the 23rd, the representatives, with matters concluded in the province, took the night express train to Shanghai. Yesterday, Wang Yansong of the native place association hosted a dinner for the representatives. Mr. Wang Xiaolai, chairman of the Shaoxing Seven County Native Place Association, also attended, discussing the contents of the case. Chairman Wang promised to uphold justice and truthfully telegraph to the native place associations in Beijing and Shanghai for a fair resolution. Currently, the delegation plans to go to Beijing and request the association to send additional representatives to petition the national government. It was resolved to appoint supervisors Wang Yansong and He Wuliang as representatives. (2) The case of Yu Shengjie, actually named Feng, encroaching on 1,394 mu of academic property in the county was resolved to be submitted to the provincial chairman for thorough investigation. (3) The case of a tragic incident involving farmers in the lake fields, which should be announced, was resolved to telegraph the Zhejiang Provincial Government to order the county to handle it impartially. Next, they discussed scheduling the fourth general meeting and other matters before adjourning. Announced by the Shangyu Native Place Association in Shanghai.</p>

<h3 id="e111">Chen Gengxin Kidnapped <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Four Thugs in Total</p>
<p>Acted on Ningbo Road</p>
<p>Thugs Informed the Victim</p>
<p>About the Car's Whereabouts</p>
<p>Around 7 o'clock last night, Chen Gengxin, a major yarn merchant, was kidnapped by thugs in front of a friend's door at 68 Ningbo Road in the French Concession. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Chen Shihao Outwardly Strong, Inwardly Weak: Chen Shihao, styled Gengxin, is 51 years old, from Dinghai, Ningbo. He is the comprador of the Baoxing Yarn Factory in Dachang, Zhabei. The factory's main wholesale office is located at 243 Ningbo Road, Wufu Lane, in the Public Concession. His family resides at 870 Hengqing Lane, Lloyd Road. He has two sons and one daughter. The eldest son works at the factory's wholesale office, and the younger son is still studying. Recently, due to the poor business of the yarn factory, the factory could not escape unscathed, so Chen only holds an empty title and is outwardly strong but inwardly weak.</p>
<p>Visiting Mr. Li Every Afternoon: Chen met a friend named Li Chijie about a year ago. Li is in his thirties and used to work at the Bank of Communications but has been unemployed for a long time. He keeps a prostitute and resides on the third floor of the Jin Yu Law Firm at 68 Ningbo Road in the French Concession. Chen takes a car to Li's place every day around 3 pm. It has become a daily routine, regardless of the weather, and Li and the prostitute treat him with respect, regarding him as an honored guest.</p>
<p>Meeting Yarn Merchant, Visiting Li Earlier: Yesterday morning around 9 am, Li Chijie went to the wholesale office to negotiate with Chen because a yarn merchant from Changshu wanted to trade with the Baoxing factory, and Li acted as a broker. Before leaving, he asked Li to meet him earlier. At 3:30 pm, Chen took the green car No. 3715 directly to Li's place.</p>
<p>Four Thugs Carried Out the Kidnapping: Chen was at Li's place, and before he knew it, the clock struck seven. Chen bid farewell. Just as he stepped into the car, as the chauffeur Peng Amao (from Tongzhou) was starting the engine, four thugs suddenly rushed out from the roadside, each holding a handgun. They forbade the chauffeur from making any noise, then rushed into the car and forced the chauffeur to drive west. At that time, Ningbo Road was lined with vendors and crowded with tourists, and no one noticed. Even his friends Li and the prostitute were completely unaware.</p>
<p>Thugs Notified the Location of the Car: The car went past North Chu Chia Chiao, went straight to the west along Avenue Joffre, and soon turned into Hualong Road. The thugs pushed the chauffeur Peng Amao down. One thug drove the car to the north and disappeared. After Peng was driven away, he planned to return to the Avenue Paul Beau report to Chen's younger brother Hansan. But before the chauffeur arrived, the telephone at Chen's home suddenly rang. He listened carefully and heard the thugs informing that the car was abandoned near the dog racing field on Avenue du Père Robert, and told him to send someone to pick it up immediately. At the same time, the chauffeur Peng Amao arrived, and then he knew that Chen had been kidnapped. When Chen's younger brother heard the news, he was terrified and rushed to Li's house at 68 Ningbo Road to inquire. Unexpectedly, Li was still as if in a dream. They went to Chen's house together on Lloyd Road to inform the family, and they sent someone to drive the car back while deliberating on how to deal with the aftermath.</p>

<h3 id="e113">Public Entertainment Venues Without Permits <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau stipulates three measures</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau issued an order to the district heads, stating, "For the purpose of issuing a notification, regarding the case reported by Zhou Pu, the fourth district head, to investigate and handle public entertainment venues without permits, we have already ordered an investigation. It is found that there are nine entertainment venues in the jurisdiction, none of which have permits. The former district head only ordered them to submit application forms and did not punish or stop their business. Please instruct us on how to handle this situation." Based on this, we find that this notice orders each district to investigate public entertainment venues. If there are those who have not been permitted by the bureau and given a permit, they should be punished and their business should be stopped. They should still be ordered to fill out an application form and apply for a permit. This refers to those who specialize in public entertainment venues. As for tea houses with storytelling or local opera venues, and other entertainment venues, most of them have tea house registration certificates from the bureau, which is different from operators who specialize in entertainment venues. If they are all punished and ordered to close down due to not having permits, then seven or eight out of ten of these tea houses with incidental entertainment venues, a large number, would be affected. Once they are closed, it would take time to apply for a permit, which would be related to the livelihood of merchants and the monthly donations of the Finance Bureau. According to the reports from each district, the handling of tea houses with entertainment venues that do not have permits, whether punished or not, is not consistent. This is not only the case in the fourth district. It is urgent to distinguish the situations, stipulate measures, and issue a notice to comply with them to ensure uniformity and fairness. The following measures are hereby stipulated: (1) Before the promulgation of the Shanghai Municipal Public Entertainment Venue Management Regulations in October 19th year of the Republic of China (1930), all old tea houses with storytelling, local opera, or other entertainment venues that have tea house registrations from the bureau are different from private setups and should be exempt from punishment and a deadline for closure. They should be limited to filling out an application form and sending it to the district offices for submission to the bureau for verification and handling. (2) Tea houses with entertainment venues, as well as specialized theaters, cinemas, storytelling venues, local opera venues, and other public entertainment venues, even if they were established before the promulgation of the Public Entertainment Venue Management Regulations in October 19th year of the Republic of China, but the tea houses do not have registration certificates and the entertainment venues do not have permits, are considered violations. They should be punished in accordance with Article 33, Section 1 of the Violation of Police Regulations for illegal operation. Since they have been operating for years and have donation permits from the Finance Bureau, they are temporarily exempt from closure and are still given a deadline to fill out an application form and send it to the district offices for submission to the bureau for verification and handling. (3) After the promulgation of the Public Entertainment Venue Management Regulations, new tea houses with entertainment venues and all kinds of specialized public entertainment venues that have not been registered and permitted by the bureau are considered deliberate violations of regulations and should be punished according to the law and their business should be stopped. After filling out an application form and submitting it to the bureau, they will be verified and handled. The above three measures, in addition to being distributed separately, are hereby ordered to the district head to immediately comply with and implement them diligently and report back. This order is issued on March 21st, 20th year of the Republic of China. Director Chen Xizeng."</p>
<h3 id="e114">The Taihu Bandit Leader Arrested <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>"Kill Pig" A-mei</p>
<p>Taihu Lake bandit leader, nicknamed "Kill Pig" A-mei, formerly under the command of Taibao A-shu, has committed numerous crimes in the Punan area. Recently, he has been hiding in the French Concession of Shanghai. Lou Ziyun, the captain of the third team of the Jiangsu Maritime Public Security Bureau, discovered this and, together with the French Concession detective, arrested A-mei at his address at 3 a.m. yesterday and escorted him to Minhang for verification in the afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Yixing Police Captain Suspected of Kidnapping Women <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Extorting Money from Criminals' Families</p>
<p>Selling Their Wives If They Don't Have Money</p>
<p>If Public Officials Are Like This</p>
<p>Where Is the Discipline of the Country</p>
<p>First Arresting Jiang Zhenggen: Wang Yaowu, the captain of the Yixing County Public Security Bureau police team, arrested Jiang Zhenggen (also known as Wang Tinghai) because he committed a robbery in Yixing. After being strictly pursued by the local government, he fled to Shanghai. Therefore, he joined forces with the Huike patrolman to detain Jiang and escort him to the Special District Local Court. Because Captain Wang did not provide a transfer document, it was not convenient to hand over the prisoner and take him away for trial. It was ordered that Jiang be detained temporarily, pending a letter from the Yixing County Government for further verification. Wang returned to Yixing to report, and the county magistrate gave him an official document, and he came to Shanghai again.</p>
<p>Subsequently Capturing Wang Ronghai: Unexpectedly, upon arriving in Shanghai, he also captured Wang Ronghai and sent him to the Huike patrolman. According to Captain Wang, Ronghai was Zhenggen's accomplice, and the patrol head detained him. The next morning, he and Zhenggen were escorted to the Special Court. Wang then submitted an official document requesting extradition. However, Ronghai was captured by Wang on his second trip to Shanghai, so the official document from Yixing County only had Zhenggen's name, so it was still not possible to take both of them away.</p>
<p>Captain Wang Extorted Money: Moreover, during the interrogation, both of them denied being robbers, and Zhenggen even claimed that since Ronghai was also detained, he heard Ronghai say in the detention center that Captain Wang had extorted 200 yuan from his family, promising to release him after receiving the money. His family was poor, and Captain Wang had actually kidnapped his wife and sold her in Shanghai, causing them to be separated. He cried bitterly, banging his head against the wooden wall he was leaning against.</p>
<p>Two More Arrested: According to the confession, the judge questioned Ronghai, who confessed that Captain Wang had indeed sold Jiang's wife. Wang Yaotang, the lawyer for the patrolman, requested that the extradition be postponed pending the patrolman's investigation of the matter. The judge granted the request and ordered the two defendants to be remanded in custody. Until the other day, Captain Wang also joined forces with the Laozha patrolman to detain Pan Tingde and Xu Sanda and escort them to the Special Court, accusing them of being involved in the assassination of a former police captain of Yixing in the 18th year (of the Republic of China). He requested permission to extradite them back to Yixing. Judge Xu also questioned them briefly because he had not submitted a formal transfer document, and ordered Pan and Xu to be detained pending a letter from Yixing for further interrogation.</p>
<p>Selling Hemp Skin: At this time, the Huike patrolman had verified Wang Yaowu's kidnapping of Jiang's wife and had also learned that Pan and Xu were both Wang Yaowu's followers. Before Xu was arrested, he was specially ordered by his master to kidnap Jiang's wife to Shanghai with Li Awu and take her to 295 Xizang Road to entrust her to a hemp skin dealer, setting a price of 250 yuan, with 200 yuan paid to Yaowu and the remaining 50 yuan going to Awu.</p>
<p>Ending Up as a Beggar: The hemp skin dealer saw that Jiang's wife was not young and not attractive, and the asking price was unusually high, so it was difficult for him. Because of the friendship, he could not refuse at the time, so he solicited around for three days, but no one was interested. He wanted to send her back, but Li and others did not want to raise this ugly woman. The hemp skin dealer also refused to provide long-term meals, so he issued an eviction order. Jiang's wife was a stranger in a foreign land and became a beggar, sleeping in the open and eating in the wind, not just for a day. The Patrolman's Accusation: The other day, she was begging along the door on Lloyd Road when she suddenly met a detective who was ordered to investigate. The detective learned the whole story and took the woman back to the Huike patrolman. He then investigated Li and others and arrested Awu in Zhabei and sent him to the police station in charge. Subsequently, his accomplice Zhou Cairong was arrested. However, the hemp skin dealer's whereabouts are still unknown. Yesterday morning, Li Zhou and the previously arrested Wang, Pan, and Xu were all escorted to the Special Court, and the patrolman's lawyer Wang Yaotang filed a lawsuit against them for the crime of kidnapping women.</p>
<p>Questioning Captain Wang: The police captain Wang Yaowu was also summoned to the case. After Judge Ge Zhiqin interrogated him, he ordered all the defendants to be remanded in custody pending the transfer of Li Awu from the Municipal Public Security Bureau for further interrogation, and ordered the investigating detectives to also take Wang Yaowu to the patrolman to inquire about everything in order to clarify the truth.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Three Lawyers Charged Together <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Plaintiff is Cantonese Woman Zheng Lanru</p>
<p>Accuses of Perjury and Aiding False Accusation</p>
<p>Lawyers Huang Shaochang, Zhang Xingyuan, Gao Hanqiao, and three others, are now heard to be filed a criminal complaint to the Special District Local Court by Zheng Lanru, a Cantonese woman residing at 671 Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, for perjury and aiding false accusation. What is the content, before the public trial, it is not easy for outsiders to understand, but it is heard that the court has accused as many as three lawyers in a case, which is rare, so it is considered that this case is very important, and it has been scheduled to be held on the afternoon of the 31st of this month to research, all notices have been issued, presumably there will be a grand debate when the deadline comes.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Suspicious Case of Corpse in a Box <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>White-haired Men and Women</p>
<p>Decomposed Bodies Divided into Two Sections</p>
<p>Two small wooden boxes were suddenly found on the open space opposite the Jiangxi Guild Hall on South Railway Station Branch Road yesterday morning, each containing a corpse, which had decomposed, but the hair was still there, white hair, seemingly male and female. The most strange thing is that both corpses were cut into two sections, and two small wooden boxes were placed on top, inside which were dry bones. Nearby residents gathered to discuss, saying that it was a case of a corpse in a box for the purpose of murder, and those who went to watch were endless. However, looking closely, it seems that the two corpses must have been corpses in intact coffins. The rogue stole a good coffin, and then placed it in a wooden box, so he cut the corpse into two sections. If it was murder, it would not have decomposed so that the face was difficult to recognize. Since it was not reported to the court for inspection, it is still difficult to clarify the truth.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Opened Two Shots Due to a Trivial Matter <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Passers-by Urinated in a Small Alley</p>
<p>Doorkeeper Failed to Arrest</p>
<p>Accountant Was Furious and Quarrelled</p>
<p>Factory Owner Fired Two Shots After Hearing the News</p>
<p>Zhang Tiankai from Fengjing opened the Tiankai Xiang Light Bulb Factory at 93 Avenue Edward VII and set up a branch factory in Yangshupu. He employed more than a hundred workers and the business was booming. Ma Haiwen from Hunan was originally a peddler. Zhang knew of Ma, so last August, Ma abandoned his peddling business and became the factory's doorkeeper. At dusk on the other day at 6 o'clock, a passerby walked to the front of the factory. Due to a sudden need to urinate, he ran into a small alley on the side of the factory. Chang Huinan, the factory's accountant from Anhui, saw him and, because it was not a place for urination, ordered Ma to drive him away. When Ma entered the alley, the passerby had already gone far away. Chang Huinan then suspected that Ma had deliberately delayed, so he could not reprimand the urinator. He arbitrarily scolded Ma, and they started arguing with each other. Zhang Tiankai happened to arrive at the factory, and Chang told Zhang about it. Zhang was furious and spoke sternly to Ma. Ma was also unwilling to back down, so they wrestled each other. Zhang had a handgun that he carried with him. At this time, he suddenly used this thing, holding the gun and shooting, firing twice in a row. Ma quickly avoided, without injury. Afterwards, Ma reported to the Jing'an Temple patrolman, who sent detectives to Zhang's residence at 109 Avenue de Conty, arrested Zhang, and searched out a handgun, three bullets, one bullet casing, and one bullet box. He was escorted to the Special District Local Court yesterday, and Judge Ge interrogated him. The patrolman's lawyer Zhang Tianyin claimed that it has not yet been decided whether the case should be prosecuted for the crime of interfering with freedom under Article 319 of the Criminal Code, or for the crime of attempted murder under Article 282, Section 2. He is now prosecuting it as a crime of interfering with freedom, and if it is deemed inappropriate after the interrogation, it should be corrected. He then recounted the circumstances of the incident. The defendant Zhang Tiankai hired Jiang Yiping and Zheng Wenkai as lawyers to defend him. Then, Ma Haiwen was summoned for questioning, who testified that Zhang first slapped him on the cheeks, then kicked him in the chest, and then fired a shot at him, the bullet flying past him. He was extremely frightened, so he hugged Mr. Chang tightly. He did not see clearly when the defendant fired the second shot. Finally, he was dragged into the factory and beaten. When questioned, the accused confessed that because he had received threatening letters, he had donated to the Public Works Department to obtain a handgun for self-defense. Last night, he entered the factory, heard a lot of noise, and saw people fighting, and the order was very chaotic. At first, he did not know the reason, and when he asked Chang Huinan, he learned that the matter started with Ma Haiwen. At that time, Ma rushed towards me with an iron rod, so I fired a shot at the ground as a warning, telling Ma to give up the iron rod. He refused and wanted to commit violence, so he fired the second shot, and Ma escaped. My firing was really for self-defense and had no ill intentions. The iron rod held by Ma has been sent to the patrolman this morning. Chinese and Western detectives immediately declared in court that they had not seen any iron rod sent to the patrolman and requested that the case be postponed for investigation. The defendant's lawyer then requested bail for the defendant. Judge Ge ordered Zhang Tiankai to post a security of 5,000 yuan and wait for a further hearing on the 30th of this month.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Murder of a Concubine - The Culprit Returned from the Capital to Shanghai <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Allegedly, the Concubine Had Another Lover</p>
<p>Ma Songting, a native of Suqian, strangled his concubine, Song Qiaobao, a native of Suzhou, to death at 373 Hejian Road on the morning of February 13th last year, hid the body under the bed, stole the woman's private stash of a gold bracelet, four gold rings, and 150 yuan in cash, and fled without a trace. More than a year later, his brother, Ma Shouting, suddenly reported to the Yangshupu Police Station that his younger brother, Ma Songting, had been captured by the Nanjing Public Security Bureau. The police chief immediately requested the Special District Local Court to prepare a document and send Detective Shen Yuzhou to the capital to bring him back to Shanghai. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng opened the court for interrogation. Lawyer Li Zhishan of the police station stated that the defendant had confessed at the police station that he strangled the woman to death with a rope because she had another lover, but denied stealing any property. Ma Shouting then testified that in May of the year before last, his brother, along with the deceased and her mother, Song Gao, came to Shanghai from Suzhou and lived in the pavilion of his house. They had always been on good terms. On the day of the incident, at 10:00 AM, Song Gao suddenly went to the Third Factory of a Japanese company and told him that her daughter Qiaobao and Songting were both missing, along with some gold jewelry and money. He immediately took leave from the factory to help search for them. At 7:00 PM in the evening, he finally discovered Qiaobao's body under the bed, her neck strangled with a rope, and Songting was still missing. He suspected that he was the culprit and went to Suzhou and Kunshan to search for him, and recently learned that he had been arrested in Beijing. When questioned, Ma Songting claimed to be a dealer in old goods. That morning, he went to Yinxiang Port to collect old goods and returned home half an hour later. As soon as he entered the door, Song Gao shouted loudly, "Songting is back!" Qiaobao heard the sound and came downstairs and prevented him from going upstairs. Then he saw a man jump onto the roof and escape. He suspected that the man must be Qiaobao's lover. He scolded her, but Qiaobao slapped him and bit his arm,缠绕不停 (entangled him endlessly), so he strangled her to death with a麻 rope (flax rope) (or 麻绳, depending on typesetting in Chinese). He did not hide the body under the bed and fled immediately, and did not take any gold jewelry or silver dollars. The court ordered the defendant to be detained and adjourned the hearing for further investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e121">The Shanghai Municipal Council's Annual Report for Last Year <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Released Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's report for 1930 was released yesterday. It includes:</p>
<p>The Commandant of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps reported that at the end of last year, the entire corps had 1,857 members, 93 fewer than at the end of the previous year. Most of the reduction was due to repeated violations of the regulations, resulting in forced discharge. The American Company performed the best among all units.</p>
<p>The Fire Brigade reported that there were 671 alarms within the settlement last year, 19 fewer than the previous year. However, the loss ratio increased from 0.094% to 0.148%. Property at risk totaled taels 71,204,021. Annual water consumption was 1,421,450 gallons, and the hoses used could stretch 42 miles. There were 17 deaths, compared to 45 last year. The brigade also assisted in extinguishing fires outside the settlement 25 times.</p>
<p>The Police Department reported that last year, there were 40 armed confrontations with bandits during arrests. Four Chinese officers were killed and 13 were injured. Fifteen bandits were killed and 14 were injured. At the end of last year, there was a shortage of 151 Chinese officers. Due to the limited space in the training center, it was impossible to train many people at the same time to quickly fill the vacancies. It is now planned to hire qualified Chinese personnel to serve as patrolmen, with the aim of assigning one Chinese patrolman to each police district to manage police affairs.</p>
<p>The Police Court Advocate reported that 97,665 cases were prosecuted in the Local Court last year, with 19,457 convictions.</p>
<p>The Public Works Department reported that construction within the settlement reached a new record last year. Based on the estimated value of the licenses issued, private construction costs amounted to taels 46,633,800. In addition, there were miscellaneous projects worth taels 2,000,000. Public construction was also substantial, totaling approximately taels 27,000,000 for the year. However, due to the fall in the price of silver and the rise in the cost of building materials compared to last year, it is estimated that approximately taels 10,000,000 was due to the increase in expense due to the high cost of gold and the low cost of silver, so the ratio of construction costs only increased by about 30% to 35% over last year. A total of 6,818 Chinese-style houses and city houses were added throughout the year. After deducting the 3,796 houses that were demolished, there was a net increase of 3,022 houses. 327 Western-style houses were added, but after deducting the 309 houses that were demolished, there was a net increase of only 18 houses. In addition, new and renovated buildings included 3 hotels, 5 Western-style apartments, 35 office buildings, 298 Western-style shops, 6 theaters, 6 schools, 3 cotton mills, 24 factories, 64 warehouses, 1 hospital, 3 telephone exchanges, and 1,002 other buildings.</p>

<h3 id="e123">Shanghai's All-Day Broadcasting Radio Station <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai is a meeting place for Chinese and foreigners, and all kinds of businesses are thriving. However, a perfect and excellent broadcasting station is still lacking. It is now reported that the world-renowned Reuters News Agency and the well-reputed Meilingdeng Advertising Company in this city have jointly established a wireless broadcasting company with a Chinese and Western board of directors to oversee its operation. They have already built a broadcasting machine at 115 Edward Road in the Meilingdeng Building, which can reach a distance of 500 miles. A consulting group composed of wireless radio experts from various wireless radio companies in Shanghai, such as the United States Wireless Radio Company, Philips Trading Company, Telefunken Wireless Telegraph Wheeler Company, Asia Electric Company, and Cananda, will provide guidance to ensure that daily broadcasting is uninterrupted. Furthermore, there is a program committee dedicated to scheduling various interesting programs, which will be performed by members of the Shanghai ABC Drama Troupe. Mr. Gan Pu, the principal of the Huatong Public School, has also been invited to prepare for the transmission of English education, which is a good opportunity for Chinese people to practice English. The wireless radio management is under the direction of Mr. Auster, who has extensive experience in this field in the United States. Every day at 1:00 PM and 8:30 PM, Reuters news from abroad or about the Pacific region is broadcast in Chinese and Western languages. Chinese and foreign newspapers will also join in broadcasting local news, and Reuters' local financial news will be reported in Chinese. The broadcasting station aims to continuously broadcast various beneficial and interesting programs from 11:00 AM to 11:00 PM every day to serve the listeners. The station has been decorated by the Biju Company and has two broadcasting studios, a reception room, and an office. There are also two windows separated by glass so that the broadcasting situation can be observed from outside the room, which is particularly unique. Twelve musicians have been hired to be available for customers to choose from. Currently, each wireless radio company in Shanghai broadcasts various programs twice a week, which is very effective in terms of advertising. The equipment is now being installed, and broadcasting will begin in late April or early May. The Ministry of Communications has also issued a license. For more information, please contact Reuters News Agency and Meilingdeng Company.</p>

<h3 id="e134">Ministry of Education Proposes to the League of Nations <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Exchange of University Professors</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Ministry of Education sent a letter to the League of Nations suggesting that Chinese universities exchange professors with European and American universities in order to promote academic communication and cooperation between China and the West. The letter was written in English, and the main points of the original letter are translated as follows: Sirs, Our Ministry has recently received a suggestion from the President of Nanjing Central University that, based on the cooperation between China and the League of Nations in other undertakings, in order to promote academic communication between Chinese universities and European universities, we propose that the League of Nations send renowned professors to China to hold lectures. If the League of Nations agrees to this, China is very willing to send renowned domestic scholars, such as writers, philosophers, historians, and antiquarians, to lecture abroad. At the same time, the League of Nations should also select renowned European and American university professors, such as medical scientists, natural scientists, and political and legal scholars, to lecture in China for the purpose of exchange. This method will undoubtedly promote Chinese and Western cultures and facilitate communication of ideas. In practical terms, Central University is very welcoming of the League of Nations sending professors to China to hold lectures. Furthermore, the university currently needs a professor of English literature (who must be British), a professor of geography who can specially emphasize field work, and a professor of geology who specializes in geological structure and knows how to conduct field geological surveys. The latter two are preferred to be of German, Austrian, Swedish, or Swiss nationality and proficient in teaching in English. If the League of Nations considers this method feasible, our Ministry hopes to first send the aforementioned professors to China to lecture. When necessary, China will also send renowned scholars to lecture in Europe. As for the monthly salary for these exchange lectures, Central University can only offer 320 yuan in national currency. Our Ministry hopes for an possible indication of this special cooperation. If necessary, we may seek financial assistance from other sources to subsidize the expenses of exchange lectures in China. Our Ministry is not very clear about the scope of the League's work in cultural movements. Therefore, we would like to receive detailed instructions on the possibility of China cooperating effectively with the League's organizations, especially the International Institute of Intellectual Cooperation and the Educational Activities Photography Institute. Our Ministry welcomes individual contact with the League's organizations. The first step towards this goal is to propose Mr. Wu Zhihui as a member of the League of Nations Committee on Intellectual Cooperation. Mr. Wu will personally attend the committee meeting in July this year, and his secretary can help with liaison and progress on this matter and other cooperative matters.</p>

It asked whether China plans to send a representative to attend and whether there is an organization for a delegation of modern language professors, hoping to be instructed and notified by telegram after deliberation.

According to Article 5 of the Regulations on Commendation for Donating Funds to Promote Education, in addition to awarding a first-class certificate from the department concerned, a copy of the original report and a table of facts should be enclosed and submitted for review and forwarding to the National Government for a decree of commendation to encourage others.</p>
<h3 id="e137">The Directors of the Education Bureaus of Jiangning and Jiangdu Represent 21 Counties in Jiangsu and Anhui to Petition the Ministry <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the case of the education salt tax being assigned to the tax inspection office for collection, a special dispatch from Yangzhou stated that since the northward migration of salt transportation, all previous methods of paying taxes and levies have been gradually changed. It is now heard that the salt tax of 21 counties in Jiangsu and Anhui, including Jiangdu and Tianchang, has also been assigned to the Yangzhou tax inspection office for collection. This has caused panic among the education bureaus of the respective counties. It is recently heard that the directors of the education bureaus of the counties have jointly elected Tian Shunlin, the director of the Jiangning Education Bureau, and Chen Da, the director of the Jiangdu Education Bureau, to draft a document and personally go to the Ministry of Finance to petition. The original document is copied below to give a general idea of the past and present situation of the salt tax. The document states: "We have investigated that the education taxes of the 21 counties belonging to Jiangsu Province, including Jiangning and Jiangdu, as well as Jurong, Liuhe, Lishui, Gaochun, Jiangpu, Yizheng, Gaoyou, Baoying, Xinghua, Taixian, Dongtai, Rugao, Nantong, Haimen, Funing, Yangzhou, Yancheng, and Anhui Province's Tianchang, regarding the additional tax on salt, have always been collected by the Yangzhou Salt Transport Office under the Lianghuai salt tax item and allocated to the bureaus. This has been the case for many years. Recently, a letter from the office stated that on February 21 of this year, it received document No. 2255 from the Yangzhou Tax Inspection Office stating, 'Upon investigation, the additional tax on salt will be collected by this office from March 1 of this year and has been ordered to be notified accordingly. We have investigated that the Jiangdu County education fee of five cents per dan of Huainan salt is collected by the office and directly sent to the Yangzhou Educational Assets Office for verification and collection. Now, from March 1, it will be collected by this office and should be paid by the salt merchants along with the regular and additional taxes and verified and collected by the Bank of China in Yangzhou and credited to the account of the Ministry of Finance to comply with the original plan. In addition to separate instructions, we hereby instruct the office to immediately notify the salt merchants for their information.' Upon receiving this, Director Shunlin and Director Da consulted with the directors of the aforementioned 21 counties' education bureaus, who replied successively that the additional tax on salt is used to offset local education expenses and is very important. Once it is assigned to the tax inspection office for collection, they are sincerely afraid that the foundation will be shaken, which will affect education expenses. They also stated that it was reported that the 11th State Council meeting of the Executive Yuan resolved to inform the ministry to follow the instructions. Now that the Yangzhou Tax Inspection Office has already instructed the Salt Transport Office to collect the additional tax on salt from March 1, the education expenses of the 21 counties will not be allocated as usual from March. In this situation, it is necessary to jointly request the protection of the principle of independent education expenses. Therefore, they unanimously elected Director Shunlin and Director Da to go to the capital and provincial capital to petition separately. In addition to submitting a separate report to the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education and submitting it to the Jiangsu Provincial Government for consultation with the ministry, we humbly request the ministry to consider the importance of local education and earnestly request that the additional tax on salt be directly allocated under the Lianghuai salt tax item as before. We also request that the Bank of China in Yangzhou be allowed to retain it, and the Salt Transport Office will still be allowed to collect and distribute it on its behalf to maintain education and avoid complications. Is this appropriate? We humbly request your approval for compliance."</p>

The location will be the Chinese track and field grounds, and the time will be 2:00 PM.</p>

<h3 id="e151">The American Team Wins This Year's International Basketball Championship <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Defeated China 38-27 in the third final last night</p>
<p>Alas, for the Chinese team in this year's International Basketball Tournament. After an initial disappointment, they defeated the strong American team in the second match, surviving by the skin of their teeth, and secured an equal opportunity in the third final at the Chinese Basketball Hall last night. Many people believed that the Chinese team would be able to defeat the Americans and retain the A.B.C. Cup for another year. However, things rarely go as planned, and in the final act, the Americans triumphed with a score of 38-27, snatching the championship trophy. The A.B.C. silver cup will once again be displayed by the American team for the first year.</p>
<p>Victory and defeat are inevitable</p>
<p>The American team's victory was due to their superior abilities and not a matter of luck. Squier, the outstanding player in the basketball world and the core of the American team, led the entire team to success with his skill and guidance. It can be said that he is a dragon among heroes, with exceptional intelligence and courage. Bissell and Mains, the cornerstones, played exceptionally well last night, scoring nearly half of the team's points. Pierce and Hannes did their best and could not be faulted. Only Smith was not at his usual level and was not as impressive as in the past.</p>
<p>Good and bad are publicly recognized</p>
<p>The Chinese team's performance was inconsistent. In the first ten minutes, they played with lightning speed and overwhelming force, surpassing the Americans in intensity. Lu Zhongsi was the mastermind, and the other four players were able to fully develop their skills. However, the good times did not last, and the situation gradually deteriorated. Despite regrouping and fighting hard, they were still lacking. The forwards lost their momentum, and the defenders made mistakes. In the end, they desperately tried to survive, but the overall situation was irreversible. Both sides then used their substitutes, which was a highlight before the closing.</p>
<p>Riding the wind and breaking thousands of miles of waves</p>
<p>The game started at 7:00 PM. The opening tip-off was won by the American team, but Lu Zhongsi quickly stole the ball and passed it to Wei Haiqing. Wei, under the basket, hesitated and missed. Kong Guangyi's long shot was also off target. Wei Haiqing redeemed himself and scored the first points, putting the Chinese on the board. The American team was startled, and the US team counterattacked, advancing on all fronts. Hannes took the lead, but Chen Xianglong stopped him, drawing a foul. Hannes converted both free throws, making the score 2-2. Liang Guoquan made a layup under the basket, and Wei Haiqing jumped into the air and scored. The momentum was greatly enhanced, and the Chinese players, riding the wind and breaking thousands of miles of waves, seemed to have the ambition to restore peace to the world.</p>
<p>A wave stirring ten thousand acres</p>
<p>The Chinese team's eight minutes of struggle created a sensation. Like a wave stirring ten thousand acres, a spark could start a prairie fire. The forwards were successful, and the defenders followed up. However, the inside was vulnerable, and the American players invaded. Squier scored, followed by Hannes. The scores of the two teams became equal. At that time, they encouraged each other and fought fiercely. American Smith and Bissell's two goals were like flying generals descending from the sky, catching everyone by surprise. From then on, the Americans steadily improved, while the Chinese could only watch from afar. The score at halftime was 21-14 in favor of the Americans.</p>
<p>The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak</p>
<p>During the break, the Chinese team's strategist, Jin Hong, secretly gave instructions. As the second half began, they passed the ball three or four times, and Wei Haiqing scored, sending a wave of excitement through the crowd. Some thought that with a good start, it would not be difficult to regain control. However, time passed quickly, and the situation changed abruptly. The American team was well-prepared, and every attack was successful. The Chinese team's spirit was willing, but the flesh was weak. They faced many difficulties and could not move forward. The outcome was already decided, and both sides used their substitutes. In the end, the Americans won 38-27. In summary of the three final games, the Americans won two to one, claiming this year's championship.</p>

<h3 id="e153">The Death of Fan Fanshan <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>--Chen Yuanliang</p>
<p>The poet Fan Fanshan fell ill in the old capital last autumn and never recovered. Literary enthusiasts were deeply concerned, hoping for a speedy recovery and more of his brilliant works. However, the shocking news arrived that he had passed away due to a stroke at 9:30 PM on March 14th. Literary figures throughout the country must be saddened.</p>
<p>Fan was from Enshi County, Hubei. From a young age, he possessed remarkable talent and a strong family education, so he always excelled in examinations. He studied with the great scholar Li Ciming and gained deep insights. His poetic talent was outstanding, and he could write essays with ease. When Zhang Nanpi was governor-general of the province, he heard of Fan's name and recruited him into his staff. Through long-term influence, Fan's learning advanced even further. After passing the provincial examination, he was promoted to the position of Jinshi (presented scholar). Subsequently, he was appointed as the magistrate of Yichuan County, Shaanxi. Fan was skilled in debate and could resolve cases with a few words, winning the approval of listeners. His judgments and rulings were both solemn and humorous, widely praised. When Ronglu was in power, he invited Fan to join his staff and assist in strategy for some time. When the Boxer Rebellion broke out, Fan followed the emperor during the crisis. Later, the reform edicts of Empress Dowager Cixi were entirely written by him. At that time, Fan's prominence was at its peak, which aroused jealousy, leading to his dismissal. The following year, he was reappointed as the Jiangning Treasurer. At that time, Duanfang was the governor-general of Liangjiang. In his spare time, he often enjoyed discussing ancient and modern events with Fan. When the revolutionary army rose and Nanjing fell, Fan fled to Shanghai, closed his doors to study, and did not ask about worldly affairs. He once wore a Taoist robe, took a picture, and wrote a poem on it, which included the line, "If the court asks about Tao Hongjing, the pine breeze in June cools my pillow and mat," showing it to friends to express his determination. Li Yuanhong recommended him as the Minister of Civil Affairs, but he refused. Yuan Shikai also admired his talent and treated him with great respect, but he only reluctantly accepted the position of advisor. Fan was honest and upright as an official. Although he held a prominent position, he remained poor. Therefore, his funeral was arranged by his close friends, Li Shikang and others. He left behind a widow, a daughter-in-law, and two grandsons, and their situation was quite desolate. However, he left behind a wealth of writings, including published collections of poetry, ci poetry, prose, political essays, official documents, and notes. Among them, poetry was the most abundant, with about 20,000 unpublished poems. He truly deserves to be called a poet of his generation. His official documents were widely circulated and praised, and legal scholars regarded them as models. In his later years, Fan devoted himself to pleasures. Whenever he was at banquets, surrounded by beautiful women, his poetic inspiration would surge, and good lines would flow like pearls. He particularly liked opera, focusing on the roles of female impersonators. When Mei Lanfang first created the "Goddess Scattering Flowers" opera, Fan wrote poems to praise him, filled with enchanting and warm affection. As for actresses such as Xin Yanqiu, Rong Lijuan, Meng Lijun, Liu Yanqin, Xiao Lanfen, and the Ma sisters, Yanyun and Yanqiu, almost all became famous with his support. Now that he has passed away, it is conceivable that those actresses will also frown and express their sorrow.</p>
<h3 id="e154">The Origin of Horse Racing <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>--Lu Bing</p>
<p>Every spring and autumn, horse races are held in Shanghai. The racetrack is filled with men and women, and skilled jockeys get the chance to show off their skills. The practice of horse racing has ancient origins, with a history of about five thousand years. In the past, monarchs raised horses for racing and entertainment, not for the general public.</p>
<p>Recent archaeological discoveries in the Mesopotamian plains have revealed that the earliest horse races did not originate in Europe but in Asia. The Hittite people of Asia Minor were very fond of this activity. According to records, this was more than 1,000 years before the Common Era. The records detail the methods of training horses before major races. Professor Hou Langxi of Borago University made a detailed study of the findings and learned that although the people of that time were not fully civilized, they were advanced in the field of horse racing. This is truly remarkable. They paid attention to the horses' diet, ensuring that they were not overweight. They also bathed the horses frequently to ensure balanced development. The training methods were methodical, progressing from slow walks to fast runs, and the methods used were indeed excellent. It is also stated that the period from the start of training to the race was about six months.</p>
<h3 id="e155">An Interview at Mr. Zhang Yuguang's Studio <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Jiren</p>
<p>It has been a year since I left Shanghai. At the beginning of this month, I returned to the city by the sea. I visited the renowned painter Mr. Zhang Yuguang at his residence, "Yezhou Studio," on Xietu Road. I also presented him with over ten rare goldfish as a birthday gift. This was because Mr. Zhang and I share a refined hobby. Yezhou Studio consists of three rooms, located in the center of a garden. The garden spans about two to three acres and is densely planted with flowers and trees. Two grape trellises extend for several lengths. It is a pity that the early spring snow damaged the buds and leaves. Otherwise, the beautiful garden would be even more inviting. To the right of the studio is a pool of spring water, with weeping willows gently touching the ground, creating a serene and secluded scene. On the side of the garden, there is a statue of the revolutionary hero Zhao Sheng, about ten feet tall, imposing and magnificent, worthy of being a great figure of his era. I asked Mr. Zhang about it, and he informed me that it was originally made for Jingkou Park and this was the remaining plaster model. Inside the studio, the walls are adorned with a dazzling array of works, including pastel drawings, oil paintings, charcoal drawings, watercolors, brush paintings, and ink sketches. All are copied from Western works and ancient originals, or blend Chinese and Western styles into one. Original creations make up the majority. They are all so perfect that a young novice like myself dares not comment on them. Mr. Zhang quickly offered me a seat and asked about my life in the countryside, showing much appreciation. Although I am not a refined scholar, I am naturally proud and unwilling to follow the crowd. I admire Mr. Zhang for making a living through art, avoiding dependence on others. However, I fear my imitation will only be a superficial attempt. Later, we discussed contemporary figures and Mr. Zhang's past contributions to the revolution in his younger years. Mr. Zhang said, "During that period, I assisted Yu Youren in running the 'Min Li,' 'Min Hu,' and 'Min Xu' newspapers, tirelessly promoting the revolution. Time has passed, and I am now old and unable to contribute much. As for important figures in the party and the nation, such as my old friends Wang Zhengting and Ye Chucang, my close friend Niu Tiesheng, and my wife's younger brother Jing Hengyi, they are still working diligently for the country. I, on the other hand, have devoted myself to painting and immersed myself in art. I no longer have the heroic spirit of those years." He sighed as he spoke. It was past noon, and I bid farewell. Mr. Zhang insisted on me staying for lunch, which I could not refuse. Soon, Mr. Zhang's wife, Ms. Huang, returned. After being introduced, I learned that she had been working at the local detention center for many years, being a pioneer in women's participation in politics. Ms. Huang was very kind and did not have the common habits of the time, which was admirable. After a satisfying meal, I returned home and wrote this account.</p>
<p>▲ Short News: The Cantonese singer and dancer Ms. Zi Luolan recently performed at the National Grand Theater in the capital, with daily ticket sales exceeding 2,000 yuan. Gifts from important figures in the party and the nation numbered in the hundreds. The Capital Cinema intended to invite Ms. Zi Luolan to continue her performances. However, Mr. Luo Mingyou of Lianhua Film Company invited her to Tianjin. She departed on the Jinpu train on the 20th. After arriving in Tianjin, she will perform at the Guangming Grand Theater for three days, then go to Beijing to perform at the Zhenguang, Ping An, and Mingxing theaters. She is expected to return to Shanghai in about a month to fulfill her contract with Lianhua Film Company to make a sound film. Many venues in Suzhou, Hangzhou, and other places have also invited her to perform. (Jia)</p>
<p>▲ Correction Regarding Guyi Garden: In the article about Guyi Garden published on March 20th, there were some errors. Guyi Garden was built by the great painter Li Liufang of the Ming Dynasty, known as the "Old Man of Tanyuan." The garden is known for its square bamboo, a special product. The inscription was written by Dong Qichang, also a Ming Dynasty person. The original article mistakenly stated that he was from the Qing Dynasty. This correction is made. (Shan Ruo)</p>
<h3 id="e156">China's "All Quiet on the Western Front" <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Kangmin</p>
<p>"All Quiet on the Western Front" is a world-renowned novel. Recently, it has been translated into multiple versions in our country and made into a film. The Chinese people have almost universally welcomed this kind of famous work depicting war. However, looking back at our own country's novels, there is a lack of such grand creations depicting war, which is truly regrettable. Recently, I heard about the emergence of a great war novel. People in literary circles are excitedly spreading the news. The author is said to be Mr. Huang Zhenxia, who was once widely reported to have died in battle at Guide. Mr. Huang has returned from the battlefield and completed "On the Longhai Line." He vividly depicts life on the front lines, the true face of war, the situation of charging into battle, and the psychology of soldiers. It is comparable to Remarque's "All Quiet on the Western Front." However, Remarque's work has a foreign flavor, creating a gap with the psychology of Chinese readers. Mr. Huang's "On the Longhai Line" is truly a local scene, like vegetables that taste best when grown in one's own garden. I predict that Mr. Huang's work will become a bestseller, as popular as Remarque's.</p>
<p>What kind of person is Mr. Huang? Readers should remember that this newspaper's "Art World" section often published his poems and essays. His concise writing style and beautiful diction left a deep impression on people. Mr. Huang's ancestral home is in eastern Guangdong, but he grew up in Shanghai. He lost his father at a young age, and his mother also died of appendicitis last year. Feeling lonely and overwhelmed with sorrow, he indulged in alcohol and women every day. North Sichuan Road is known as a mysterious street in Shanghai. Whenever the moon rose, he would walk alone there, sometimes venturing into dance halls to dance wildly under the lights. This was also due to the unspeakable pain in his life. Later, rumors spread among his friends that Mr. Huang had disappeared, which seemed bizarre. People scrambled to inquire about him. Within a month, they learned from Mr. Huang's close friends that he had enlisted in the Central Army when it was recruiting new soldiers at the North Station. From then on, he abandoned his pen and joined the army, emulating Ban Dingyuan's heroic deeds. Letters were exchanged from time to time. Later, he was admitted to the Central Military Academy. When the news came, his friends celebrated with great joy, marking this day as Mr. Huang's rebirth. When Yan Feng raised troops in rebellion, the Central Army was deployed to the front lines. Mr. Huang was able to participate as a recruit from the Central Military Academy. Then, correspondence ceased. During the battle of Guide, our army showed a determination to fight to the death, suffering heavy losses. Mr. Huang's fate was uncertain, and there was no news of him. All those who knew or did not know Mr. Huang sighed with sorrow, believing that there was no chance of survival in the chaos of battle. This newspaper's "Art World" section, as well as the "Vanguard Weekly" and "Vanguard Monthly," all published memorial articles one after another. Who knew that events are impermanent and news is not always accurate? After the military situation was settled and the overall situation stabilized, our army returned in triumph. It was then that people learned that Mr. Huang was still alive. Friends were overjoyed upon hearing this good news. Upon his return, Mr. Huang first visited Mr. Zhu Yingpeng. He was overjoyed to have survived the battlefield. At that time, he spoke eloquently and recounted the details of the battle. He then presented his work titled "On the Longhai Line," which was comprehensive and detailed. After polishing the manuscript, it felt even more vivid to read. It is truly the greatest achievement of the Chinese literary world. The local flavor is extremely rich, such as the steepness of Yejigang and the suffering of the people in the war zone, the scene of being displaced. Mr. Huang uses his ingenious pen to make readers feel as if they are in a war-torn environment. Calling it China's "All Quiet on the Western Front" is not an exaggeration. It is said that this work will be published in the Modern Bookstore's "Vanguard Monthly" No. 5. In addition to "On the Longhai Line," his poem "The Qin and the Sword" will also be published in the same issue.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Travels in India (4) <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>On the morning of the 23rd, I visited various bookstores. I saw countless English books written by Indians themselves. Their academic and cultural wealth surpasses that of our country. Very few people in our country can write in English, while various Indian philosophies are translated into English in abundance. Observing Tagore's world cultural and artistic movement, one knows that Western culture has been greatly influenced by Indian culture. China today is greatly lacking in contributions to world culture, almost to the point of being insignificant. In the prosperous Han and Tang dynasties, after the world was settled, culture and education were promoted. All the more so should we do that in this age of international communication. While talking with an Indian, I learned that the Japanese Iroha alphabet, created by the monk Kukai, was based on Indian phonetics. Therefore, many Japanese sounds add the "a" sound. Today, Indians also pronounce many sounds in this way. Therefore, when Indians mix their native pronunciation with English, their English sounds very different from Chinese pronunciation.</p>
<p>Indian universities now have Indian history courses. But Mr. Xinhan told me that Indian concepts are very different from those of the Chinese. Indians do not pay attention to the history of kings but pay the most attention to religious sects and academics. Therefore, there is no history of kings. Because Indian culture has been around for a long time, little of it can be verified. Clear history only began after the death of the Buddha, during the reign of King Ashoka, around 200 BC. The rest are myths, speculations, and fragmented and difficult to count. According to my reading of the famous Indian work Gita, the history of its earliest transmission began with "The Great MahabbarataWar3ioi, BC." I imagine it should be around 3101 BC. It has been about 5,000 years since then, so the length of its generations can be known. According to the Gita, Hinduism originated 5,000 years ago, more than 2,000 years before the Buddha, and it has not declined to this day. It is prevalent in India, which is also a spectacle. It is something that should be studied.</p>
<p>Dr. Mahondranath came to visit and inquired about Chinese Taoism. He invited me to his home. I briefly described the situation of Chinese culture. His students listened quietly by his side. Dr. Mohan said that he hoped for the progress of China's national power and the promotion of its culture, which he would strive to spread. He is a famous professor of philosophy at Sumkrit College, Senga Lee University. I asked him about Western philosophy, but he didn't seem to care about it. The Indian philosophy history translated by Westerners that I read admits that Indian philosophy is complex and profound, beyond the comprehension of most people in the world. Today, Indians still claim to be in the highest position in philosophy. In terms of spiritual culture, they not only hold the reins of Asia but also want to be in a guiding position in the world. Tagore has the title of "Poet Saint," and Gandhi is also called "Mahatma." Even in prison, he is not a prisoner. Judges address him as "Mahatma" and salute him before speaking. In addition, the World Buddhist Association and the Asian Women's Association convened by Indians will open next year. I heard that the Asian Art Association is being convened now.</p>

<p>Fluctuation Range Still Large Yesterday, March 25th, the benchmark gold price slightly increased. Although it fell in the morning and then strengthened, it returned to the previous level in the afternoon. The range of fluctuations throughout the day was significant, eventually increasing by seven or eight taels. The market situation was still developing. The trend of foreign exchange was tense, and the listed prices were lengthened and then shortened, but the overall evaluation was still in a long position. The market transaction was acceptable, and the bull market seemed optimistic. There were more buyers in the morning market. Companies such as Hengxing, Chengfeng, Yongcui, and Changyong fiercely competed to buy. Yuanmao, Yongxin, Heng, Hengxingyuan, and others all sold. The overseas silver market had increased, so the gold price opened low, once falling below 675 taels. Afterwards, buyers from the Guangbang and other regions became excited, especially due to the tightening of exchange rates. There was a sudden sharp increase, almost reaching the top of the day, soaring by 20 taels. However, there were fluctuations. By noon, it had suddenly exceeded 690 taels. Afterwards, the supply exceeded demand, and it slightly fell back, eventually retreating below 690 taels. Exchange rates were flat due to the lack of market on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Gradually Increasing from Low Early in the morning, the May contract opened at 679 taels, a decrease of two taels. Large silver increased by a quarter, and the silver price increased by three quarters. Private telegrams increased by six eighths, followed by one tael. Dachenghongli, Tong Taichang, Wanxing, Hengxingyuan, and others successively sold, so it trended downward. Also, because English gold was loose, Taiwan first absorbed 1425, and then the April contract of Union Bank sold 3125, and McCarly entered June 375. So the gold price fell to 74 taels and 5 qian, with a fluctuation of one or two taels. Then, Chengfeng, Yong Hengxing, Fuchang, and others came in, and it went upwards. When the Bank of England's interest rate was announced, it was 80 taels and 05 qian. Although the listed price increased by half a pence, US dollars decreased by 4.75, but the gold market was flat and unaffected. This was because the buyers held on. Not long after, it depreciated by three taels, to 77 and a half taels. Then, retailers sold. English gold in the domestic market remained stable, McCarly ate the April contract 1425, and Hengxing entered again. The price increased by five taels. Around 10:00, it was 82 taels and 5 qian. Afterwards, Yuanmaoyongsen, Changyong, and articles sold, and the China Bank sold the April English gold 1875. By 10:20, it had fallen to 76 taels. Then, it gradually increased because Taiwan and other countries absorbed June 1875, and Sanjin entered 125. Especially because Hengxing, Changsheng Yong, Yongcui Changyong, and speculator Wu and others competed to buy, the price increased by ten taels. By 11:00, it had become stronger. Yuan Chengyong and others also increased. A storm arose, and by 11:15, it had reached 91 taels. At that time, English gold had suddenly changed 125, US dollars 25, and Japanese gold increased by 1 cent. The domestic market had also increased by 4 pence. Then, Fuchang and others sold, slightly lower than three taels, to 88 taels. By 11:30, it had returned to its peak. Yu Dayuan Chengyong Yong Guli Wanxing and others came to drag it in, and English gold continued to change 125, US dollars 25, and Japanese gold added another 1.25 cents, increasing by 67 taels. Near noon, the closing price was at 95 taels, but there were very few transactions at this price, and it was difficult to complete both buying and selling. The price was immediately suppressed to four and a half taels. The initial listing price was 735 taels, a reduction of 556 taels to 23 taels. At noon, it changed to 745 taels and 8 qian, a reduction of slightly less than 50 taels.</p>
<p>The Afternoon Market Slightly Declined The afternoon market opened down to 92 and a half taels, because the goods market opened lower. Then it was 94 taels. Suddenly, I heard that the Indian exchange rate increased by 4 annas, and it fell to 90 taels and 08 qian. Then, because Shunli Wan Yimai entered, the Indian exchange rate fell by 6 annas, and it immediately increased by more than three taels. At 2:45, it was 94 taels and 3 qian. Yu Da and others sold, falling by four taels. After 3:00, it was 90 taels. Afterwards, it seemed to return upward, but there was a fluctuation of one or two taels. Transactions were not smooth, and there were no large tickets or slips. Until after 4:00, sellers on the counter were eager, and it fell by three taels. At the close of 4:30, it was 88 taels and 6 qian, an increase of 7 taels and 6 qian compared to the previous day. Afterwards, it was pulled up by two taels. Therefore, the goods market did a large nine qian. The maximum price for the day was 95 taels, and the minimum price was 74 taels and 5, a difference of 20 taels and 5 qian. The early market for goods was 79 taels, the noon closing was 94 and a half taels, the afternoon was 93 taels, and the closing price was 89 and a half taels. The listed prices were suppressed by 523 taels to 578 taels. The logged prices were 88 taels in March, 91 taels in April, 95 taels in May, and the water supplement was 88 taels.

<p>Yesterday in the bond market, spot trading was scarce. The futures market was calm in the morning, but activity increased in the afternoon, and the market became slightly more lively.

<p>The yarn market fell in the morning but rose in the afternoon. Actual sales were exceptionally brisk. Buyers from Qingdao became more aggressive, focusing on local yarn because Japanese yarn was being purchased by Eastern buyers. As a result, the supply of Japanese yarn on the market became increasingly tight. It is reported that foreign firms in China recently sold about 7,000 to 8,000 bales of cotton yarn, greatly improving sentiment. A certain major merchant is very shrewd. Although general retail investors still tend to sell, given the current strong demand, there may be drastic changes ahead.</p>
<p>People's Standard Yarn: Initial Fall, Later Rise</p>

General-purpose rice arrivals and sales were both sluggish, but inventories remained ample, so prices also weakened by about one jiao.</p>
<p>South Shanghai</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were over twenty ships arriving from the river. The sales market in this street was remarkably sluggish. Only a few Su and Chang machine-milled geng rice varieties were sought in small lots. Prices uniformly fell by one to two jiao. The situation for southern thin early rice was unfavorable. Top-quality goods were especially scarce, with medium and lower grades dominating. Buying interest was quiet. Large-scale trading dropped slightly by one and a half jiao. Mutton Du and premium customers were unenthusiastic. Sentiment was dull and prices softened. Both white yuan rice and restaurant rice markets were in a wait-and-see mode. Although arrivals were not strong, the market was very weak. Prices were all down by one jiao.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Flour Market: Difficult to Recover <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market saw a downtrend across all months. Although foreign wheat prices fluctuated, overall sentiment considered both domestic and foreign flour and wheat still to be in a period of oversupply. It was rumored that despite large shipments of American wheat seeking sales in China, foreign firms were only quoting four taels, requiring orders of no less than 50,000 tons each time. Moreover, yesterday's quoted price for Canadian flour remained only $1.27. With such pressure, the inability of sentiment to recover was understandable. As of this month, spot prices in Tianjin have also fallen sharply, from $3.12 to $3.07-08. Consequently, if gold prices fall further, the distant months may even drop to 9.5 qian. As a result, this month fell 1.5 fen compared to the previous day. April and May fell 1 fen, June and July fell 1.5 fen, and August fell 0.5 li.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Futures Wheat: Rise and Subsequent Weakening <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market initially showed positive signs after opening in the morning. This month is approaching delivery, and due to substandard foreign wheat arrivals, dealers such as Tai Kang and Ding Tai were unable to meet their upgrade requirements and had to cover their positions and ship spot goods to Hankou. Consequently, sentiment improved. Distant months also saw short covering and price hikes, rising approximately 2 to 3 fen compared to the previous day. However, in the afternoon, the market weakened somewhat due to the sluggish flour market and continued unfavorable environment. Continued arrival of foreign wheat suggested that any speculative price increases could attract more foreign wheat, which would not be beneficial for the future. The results were unchanged for this month, up 1 fen for April, up 2 fen for May, up 1 fen for June, and down 1 fen for July and August.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Customer Xian Rice: Trading Halted <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Customers Transporting from Production Areas</p>
<p>Yesterday's customer xian rice market was extremely sluggish. Although there were some train arrivals, most were brown rice and goods purchased by traveling merchants, not displayed on the market. The quantities brought by merchants were minimal, and due to the very slow sales of customer rice, prices fell, and they were unwilling to display samples. On the sales side, river arrivals were present in this street, but customer sales were unprofitable, so everyone boycotted them. As a result, there were no sales in either market throughout the day. It was heard that merchants from the Upper Jiang region were trying to source in Anhui province due to the closure of Hunan rice and lack of arrivals from Hubei. Wuhu and other ports were seeing slight price increases, making transport to the Upper Jiang region profitable.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Standard Soybeans: Fluctuation <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Dalian soybeans initially fell but later stabilized. The market opened lower in the morning due to continued declines in margin deposits. Buying interest was exceptionally weak, and most local traders were bearish. As a result, the April contract once fell below the 6-qian mark. However, after the market opened in the afternoon, Dalian reported only a slight weakening. Some customer traders bought, resulting in a fluctuating trend. Compared to the previous day, the March contract was up 1 fen, April and May were unchanged, and June was down 1 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Metals: English Steel Plates Plummeting <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Since the arrival and slow sales of English steel plates and the subsequent downward trend in prices, there has been a pattern of continuous declines. Although overseas markets have gradually shown signs of recovery, the local market continues to plummet. Although customer merchants are making purchases, recent market quotes have been very low. 2.5 li per dan sells for only 9 taels, 5 li for 7.2 taels, 7.5 li for 6.7 taels, 1 fen for 6.45 taels, and 1.5 fen or more for only 6.25 taels.</p>
<p>50 tons of TC reinforcing steel will be transported to Wuhan today by the Jiangshun ship. It is reported that this was purchased by the Wuhan Ordnance Factory. The buyer in this city was a certain metal shop in the French Concession. It is said that market inventories of this product are low, and the future trend is very optimistic.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Sugar Market: Quiet Paper Trading <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market reported that Cuban spot sugar prices rose by 3125. New York sugar futures rose by 2 points across all months. Java spot and futures prices remained unchanged. Paper trading in the Association's market was sparse. Dutch sugar No. 24, coarse sand white, priced at 10.035 to 10.03 taels, saw little interest. Medium sand white high-quality goods sold for 9.9 taels, and lower-quality goods for 9.8 taels. Dutch No. 8 red sugar sold for 8.9 taels, with sluggish trading. The market appeared flat. Japanese sugar YR mark sold for 10.03 taels, Minghua brand for 10.0275 taels, N mark for 10.015 taels, SH mark for 9.8 taels, TM mark at the same price, and YRO mark for 9.65 taels. Transactions were also very limited. The market appeared slightly tight and stable. The exchange had a local factory offering large bags of rock sugar for 12.6 taels and pole-carried rock sugar for 13 taels, in quantities of only twenty to thirty bags each, so trading was light.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Piece Goods: Medium-Weight Broadcloth Maintains Status Quo <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Medium-weight broadcloth sales to Western tailors and sewing merchants have remained steady. There is zero retail demand. Therefore, its market price has been able to maintain the status quo, unlike other variegated broadcloth and worsted cloth, which have fallen. Yesterday, Fair SSS sold for 4 taels, Tian You 1000 series remained at 4.55 taels, 2000 series at 4.6 taels, and Tian Feng brand at 4.325 taels.</p>
<h3 id="e174">North-South Goods: Wood Ear Fungus Rebounds in Hankou <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>The lowest-priced offer for wood ear fungus in Hankou was as low as 130 taels for top-grade fungus and 74-75 taels for mixed fungus. According to letters, sales have gradually increased recently, and the trend has turned bullish. Sub-grade fungus has rebounded by 10 taels, reaching 140 taels, and mixed fungus has risen to 80 taels. Even at this price, it is still inverted compared to Shanghai prices. Therefore, local merchants lack interest in buying. Looking back at the Shanghai market, ordinary mixed fungus does not exceed 90 taels, and sub-grade fungus is only 155 taels. Based on local prices, everyone would incur losses.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Silk and Tea: Continued Shipments of Tin Factory Silk to Shanghai <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>As the end of March approaches, Wuxi manufacturers are preparing to deliver this month's futures silk sold to foreign firms. Therefore, manufacturers are shipping batches of silk to Shanghai. Yesterday, the Xihu passenger train transported 130 pieces of White Factory Silk from brands such as Golden Double Deer and Golden Double Eagle to Shanghai in preparation for the end-of-month delivery to foreign firms. The local foreign firm silk market remains unchanged. Exchange rates have stabilized, and foreign Shanghai White Factory Silk telegrams show a small increase in prices. However, factories are holding firm, unwilling to sell due to continued large losses. Market sentiment is weak. Yesterday, only Xinfu shipped 10 bales of White Factory Silk to Shanghai, and Dachang and others shipped 20 bales of Sichuan Yellow Factory Silk. Prices remain weak.</p>

<h3 id="e176">Fudan Photography Society and the Fudan Photography Yearbook <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— Xi Jia</p>
<p>I dare say that, among the student-run photography groups in schools, the Fudan Photography Society is perhaps one of the most complete and spirited. This is not only the opinion of some people, but also the praise from the Hua She group, who are commonly recognized as the first-class photographers in China. Indeed, the Fudan Photography Society has a considerable position in society. The creation of this position is due to the three sensational photography exhibitions.</p>
<p>The founding of the Fudan Photography Society dates back to 1928. After a year of training, the first photography exhibition was held. The following year, the second exhibition was realized. Last year, the third exhibition, held at the same time as the 25th anniversary of Fudan University, provided most of the material selected for this Fudan Photography Yearbook.</p>
<p>In recent years, many photographic talents have emerged, and their works have spread to newspapers across the country. People who are slightly concerned about photography have also gained a considerable understanding of the Fudan Photography Society.</p>
<p>During this third exhibition, it was held on the same day as the 25th anniversary celebration, which made a very deep impression on people. Therefore, after the exhibition, various newspapers and pictorial magazines clamored for the publication of Fudan photography works. This is a fact.</p>
<p>However, the people of the Photography Society cannot be complacent, believing that they cannot provide people with a permanent opportunity to browse. Therefore, there is a desire to publish the Fudan Photography Yearbook.</p>
<p>I heard that the "Fudan Photography Yearbook" is already available for pre-sale. It is said that the content includes not only the best works from the third exhibition but also works from the first and second exhibitions. Then its results will be more fulfilling.</p>
<p>Regarding photo collections, I have seen many of them. I can say that none of the ones published in China are perfect. It is said that the copperplates for the Fudan Photography Yearbook are entirely made by the American Engraving Company. As for the printing and paper, they are certainly very exquisite.</p>
<p>In short, within a school, it is already difficult to organize a complete photography society, let alone hold an exhibition every year, and even more difficult to publish a photography collection. However, the Fudan Photography Society has been able to do it all. This not only makes us very admirable but also makes us yearn for it.</p>
<p>Now that the yearbook is about to be published, I hope that all beauty lovers in the world will have a copy in hand so as not to let down this great "Fudan Photography Yearbook" that is worth appreciating.</p>

<h3 id="e177">Youth of the Era — Issue 29 <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Zuo</p>
<p>In China today, an era of suffering, nothing is perfect. Taking the publishing industry as an example, booksellers only know how to cater to social psychology, disregarding distorted facts to accelerate production, using crudely made, trashy books to extract (plunder) money from young people. But many young people are still willing to be deceived by them.</p>
<p>Indeed, young people are too pitiful. Besides the dry and boring school textbooks, it is really difficult to find two suitable extracurricular reading materials. Apart from the crudely made, trashy books and newspapers distributed by booksellers, what other books and newspapers are available for reading? It is as difficult as ascending to heaven to find a publication that speaks for the youth themselves or books and newspapers that can defend the youth and negate aspects of themselves.</p>
<p>However, young people need not be too disappointed, because the "Youth of the Era" published by the Youth of the Era Society has solved the above-mentioned problem for us. As you can see, the new opening statement in issue 27 of the publication clearly explains:</p>
<p>"We cannot be content with the status quo and hope to express the spirit of the youth of our era, allowing our minds to grasp the comfort of the right path. As a result, we finally lift our heads from the constraints of the low-pressure atmosphere and move forward on the path of struggle."</p>
<p>Therefore, "Youth of the Era" will become a must-read publication for the youth of the era. The publication has been published for more than half a year. Originally, it was in the form of single sheets, with in-depth discussions on the theory and practice of the youth movement. Since issue 27, it has been changed to a book format, and the content has become more substantial and impressive. It is hoped that every youth of the era should pay special attention to it. Here are my recommendations for the recently published issue 29:</p>
<p>The content of this issue includes Bing's "Our Understanding of Electing Representatives to the National Assembly," Ping Ren's "Dynamic Research and Static Research," Yi Shun's "On Coeducation," Dian Zhi's "Casual Talks on Youth Reading Materials," Xu Ze Xiang's "Awakening from a Dream," and Xu Xia's "A Day of Crazy Wandering," etc. Both in terms of quality and quantity, this issue has made significant progress compared to previous issues. The editors of the publication said,</p>
<p>"This is the third time our publication has met with readers since the reorganization to this issue. In terms of quantity, it can be said to have increased somewhat in these three issues after the reorganization. But in terms of quality, we are not clever self-aware individuals, so we dare not make definitive statements. We are willing to let readers do this work. At the same time, we hope that readers who love our publication will often give us corrections and instructions, so that we can use them as guidelines and compasses." Precisely because I am a reader, I will therefore make a judgment on the quality. Although it may not be able to serve as a guideline and compass for the publication, it can at least make some contribution to the youth who are seeking good reading materials.</p>
<p>Bing's "Our Understanding of Electing Representatives to the National Assembly" is the most noteworthy article. With the National Assembly about to open and various regions conducting elections for representatives, this issue should not only be understood by young people, but also by everyone else. The author said, "In order to express the ability of us young people who are fighting for the national movement and who feel more keenly than anyone else,</p>
<p>we must have careful and precise consideration and exploration when electing representatives to the National Assembly this time. We must not resolutely regard it as a blind following without any pain or itching. We must abandon all distracting thoughts, take out the spirit of impartiality and selflessness, and elect a truly worthy leader of our youth to be our representative in this National Assembly, which is responsible for such a great mission and for solving national affairs and advancing politics." Who says it isn't so?</p>
<p>Ping Ren's "Dynamic Research and Static Research" is a reading method written based on facts and experience. He said that the goals of research have two directions: static and dynamic.</p>
<p>Using these two research methods to study can achieve the following effects:</p>
<p>Continued on Page 9</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>Continued from Page 7</p>
<p>Excellent results: (1) It prevents feeling bored during research and losing interest in studying academic subjects. (2) In-depth research into two academic subjects often leads to the same path, while also helping the progress of the other academic subject. (3) When leaving school and entering society in the future, the scope of such application is relatively broad and the opportunities for application are also many. (4) It can achieve a shortcut to specialized research in the future, which is much more practical than the currently popular plaster-selling so-called "learning methods of various subjects," without any empty drawbacks and indeed can be used as a reference for young people's reading.</p>
<p>"On Coeducation" is written by Yi Shun, who elucidates from an objective standpoint, from the historical, biological, sociological, and school perspectives, that coeducation is of great benefit to mankind, society, morality, education, temperament, and everything else, and is enough to be a wake-up call for those who are confused.</p>
<p>Mo Zhi's "Casual Talks on Youth Reading Materials" has a profound review of China's publishing industry today. After reading the section recorded below, one can know that this article has considerable value.</p>
<p>"Finally, it must be understood that the reading materials needed by our modern youth are by no means so simple, a kind of vulgar works that tend to be commercialized. In terms of knowledge and learning, they cannot make us spend our parents' blood and sweat and get considerable results. Reading such books really has no value at all. However, young people are being fooled by these booksellers (or merchants). I subjectively say a practical word, the reading materials we young people need now are practical and concrete texts that help academic progress. Those mysterious and incorrect things are not needed in the present. The most important thing is that the pricing should be particularly low. Do not be hypocritical, on the one hand, shouting to reduce the burden on readers, on the other hand, selling the books except for the highest actual price, and then according to the so-called "peer agreement, add one according to the code" money-making trick, money is certainly to be earned, but do not consign the deeply burdened mission of promoting culture to the Yellow Sea. This can also be said to be a proverb given by the youth to the new book industry."</p>
<p>In addition, Xu Ze Xiang's "Awakening from a Dream" and Shu Xia's "A Day of Crazy Wandering," both literary works, express the unique emotions of young people. The former is a poem with generous and impassioned calls, and the latter can be said to be a short story, although the author lists it as the second of Random Notes on White Snow. Because it is written in the first person, the material expressed is more thorough and deep.</p>
<p>Finally, there is also a collection of school radio reports, reporting the news of various schools, which young people probably all like to watch.</p>
<p>In addition, the publication is published by the Youth of the Era Society at 210 Fangxie Road, Ximen, and each issue only sells for three cents, which is indeed a good reading material with low price and high quality that best suits the tastes of young people. I hope young people will not ignore it.</p>
