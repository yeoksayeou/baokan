<p>時評</p>
<h3>昨日之大風雨</h3>
<p>日來我滬上人士。正竭其全力。鼓其熱心勇氣。以從事於各省水災之濟救。與所謂天災者抗。而不謂天災之來襲。突又加於我全埠人民之身。其風雨之狂烈。勢若奔馬。輪路郵電。一切交通。幾皆阻斷。記者執筆時。浦江之潮。尙滚滚向馬路奔入。頃刻之間。多數馬路。已皆没踝。而風尙怒吼不已就此現狀以論本埠之損。失如房屋摧毀。貨物淹没。一切交通之被破壞其價値之重。已不可計算。若更以此次大風雨所經過沿涨各省而論。江浙首當其衝。棉花田禾。必將一掃而盡。所受損失之慘。巨尤可想像而得。我江浙人方將不顧一切犧牲。以救各省被災之難民。而我受此大風雨後。先自突增無數之災民方藉我江浙人民縮减所餘之食糧運往災區。以救難民之急。而我受此大風雨之影響。民食亦將發生問題。嗚呼。天何不仁。使我民陷於絕境至此。再試縱目一觀各省之現象。武漢又因昨晚颶風暴雨。街屋倒塌。碼頭衝壞。人民死傷。又不知增加幾何。而山東黃河康屯民埝告警。各處口壩。亦尙在危險之中。上則災禍之來。猶尙未知其所屆。我江浙人民。旣負救人之重任。今又負自救之鉅責。更將如何奮其百倍之勇氣。以達此人已並救之目的。我政府又將如何出其救國救民之熱心。以挽回此鉅大之刦運。嗚呼。此爲我民族存亡所繫。豈尋常細故也哉。</p>
<h3>英工黨内閣之更迭</h3>
<p>近年來世界經濟之不景况。使全世界列國都陷入蕭寥凋落之悲境。即號稱黃金國家之美國。亦不能例外。英國在大戰前。本操握世界經濟之中心。大戰以後。美國實取有其地位而代之。事實已證明先進資本主義國家之大不列顛帝國。已呈現日落崦嵫之衰老形勢。迄於最近。遭逢世界普遍蕭寥之大難。英國更大受困窘。海外貿易。日益衰退。工業日益凋落。苛重之租稅。窒息國民之創業精神。耗竭國民之購買力。因之工人失業。乃日益激進。而如何救濟失業工人。乃爲英國當前之大問題。亦即當前之大難關。</p>
<p>英工黨號稱以代表勞工利益之政黨。自一九二九年麥克唐納爾被選組閣。今已執政三年。處此一面失業工人數字激增。一面國家財政入不敷出現象之下。雖以麥氏之長袖善舞。亦已窮於以（一）增稅（二）發行公債（三）减低支出。甚至减少救濟失業工人之支出爲救濟之對策。自其召集自由保守兩黨黨魁聯席會議。成立臨時息爭條約。竭力希冀反對黨之贊助面觀。吾人早已見其捉襟見肘。無以策應時艱。自其黨内發生分裂。摩斯萊一派相率脫黨。另组新黨而觀。吾人更早料其内閣命連。將終難於支持。雖麥氏曾毅然作「英國之安穩亦如英格蘭銀行之安穩」之豪語然而財政上之一籌莫展。外以來敵黨之責難。内以起同志之分裂。麥氏最後之豪語。亦適見其爲最後之掙扎耳。</p>
<p>果也。據目前消息麥氏已將提出辭。呈英皇召見保守自由兩黨領袖計議組織新閣。行將有三黨合組之國民政府出現。而工黨閣員多人。且已表示謝絕加入新政府。凡此雖已在吾人意料之。中然而要皆爲英國政府歷史篇幅中最可紀念之一頁。</p>
<p>英國素爲奉行政黨政治之國家。始以保守自由兩黨輪流執政。迨一九二四年工黨崛起。乃形成三足鼎立之形。勢平時三黨都各門戶森嚴。步趨一致各抱主張。各有政見。彼進則此絀非至萬不獲已。决不混合組閣。茲則三黨内部各形分裂。派别林立。意見紛歧無法保持其在議會中之一致步調。混合内閣。自必然應運而產生。或者三黨輪流執政之形式。亦遂將從此衰落於英倫。次之。在此工黨内閣崩潰情勢之下。麥克唐納爾與財長史諾登等之信用。顯已動搖。其内部之裂痕更顯呈深刻此後大不列顛之工黨運動。或亦遂如日過中天將漸益式微。復次。英國以奉行政黨政治議會政治之國家。目前黨派日多。政見各歧。茲後所表現於政治舞台上者。其鈎心鬭角。變幻殆更無窮。故此次工黨内閣之更迭。在英格蘭政治史上。實至足重視。</p>
<p>雖然。目前世界經濟之不景况。失業問題之嚴重。世界列國。已同感束手而無可奈何德國已向世界作最後救援之呼籲矣。美國七百萬工人之失業。亦成爲絕大難關。而亦將成爲下屆大選之重大之問題。其他如意。都何莫不然。勢之所趨。力之所迫。以經濟力之推移而呈現其政治上之捩轉與變化者。又豈僅英倫一國而已哉</p>

<h3>哈航聯局結束後</h3>
<p>丨商船組織運輸處仍然團結丨</p>
<p>上半年獲利二百萬元</p>
<p>哈爾濱通訊、今春松花江航業爲謀營業之團結、曾有擴大聯航局之組織、詎以利害衝突、爲松黑烏三江沿岸十四縣商帮所反對、交訐半年、經政委會於上月底、令飭該擴大聯航、暫行結束、來年再議、於是官商合作之船業聯合總局、遂於日昨結束矣、頃據東北船務局經理王時澤君、談航聯結束經過、并現在航運狀况、大槪如左、</p>
<p>官商航聯局結束經過官商船聯局奉命結束後、一般商船股東、以爲中途解體賬目手續均不易結束、囑東北船務局轉懇東北當局、准予緩期至於封江、但仍批駁未准、於是商方絕望、遂不得不進行結束、顧航業性質、非同其他事業、船隻開出、航路遠近旣然不同、一朝結束、另換局面、的是不易、經過各航商多次討議、方决定八月十五爲結束標準期、在此期前、各船均航回本埠、結束後方准開出、自四月二十三日航聯成立、至八月一日、各船回埠、總計半年來獲利二百、萬按照加入船隻朋分、每一元股分、可獲利三角五分、惟因外欠尙有五十萬未收回、實際分利、祇及二成五、至八月十四日、各船結束完畢即自由開出惟航聯尙有許多事件、手續未清、故猶未完全結束、開往吉林方面之輪船四隻、以櫊淺故滯吉未航回、將來另行結束之、至航聯内部、尙有少數人員服務、預定薪給支至月底、如月底事務不得辦竣、再酌留數人辦理、此外一部帆船、因與航聯局有一年租契關係、中途解約、要求多予租金、至今尙未解决、</p>
<p>現在航運之趨勢大聯合航局結束後、官輪仍由東北航務局自辦、無甚問題、商輪則比較困難、因一般船主、雖在加入航聯時、暗地嘖有煩言、而衷心固願航聯繼續下去、彼此可省心力、官商聯航局解體、自理自家業務在此時機、頗多不</p>

<p>便、所以一部分仍進行縮小範圍、就商船方面、自成一團體、以維持至封江爲止、但其中船主、具有號召力者、多半消極、不肯出頭負責、目下祇由前大聯合航局副經理富仲臣爲總經理、董事長爲宋文林、機關定名爲商船運輸處、内部分爲二課、暫於船業公會内辦事、第一批聯合船隻、已開出、將來能聯合鞏固、須俟此次成績如何爲斷、航聯局存在時、各方以利害不同肆力攻訐、取消後有數點最爲可惜、（一）冷僻航線如吉林·如興凱湖·永無船班開往之望、（二）運送難民官商輪互相推諉、不似航聯局存在時便利、（三）應當軍運、不似以前之便利、此外不便之處尙多、要非大聯合之力、難以做到、故此次船聯之取消、在興利便民原則上言、均極端可惜云、（二十一日）</p>

<h3>世界小事記</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>碩大無朋的臥牀</p>
<p>英國最著名的臥床。是新近陳列在維多利亞與亞爾白博物院VictoriannAlbertMuseum中的惠亞大牀。GreatBekofware這大牀先前曾在歐得福府Hertfordsbire惠亞鎭Ware的王冠旅舍CroWNINN用過多年後來又移到别的旅館中去。確是一件古物了。</p>
<p>英國舊時的旅舍中。似乎通用大牀。給許多旅客同睡一張牀上的。即如瑙福爾克府Norfolk司夸爾鎭Scole的白哈脫旅館WhiteHart有一張碩大無朋的牀。可容四十人之多。這是在牀歷史中。可算得空前的大牀</p>
<p>考大牀的緣起。很簡單。據包咨毛司主敎Bishopofportsmonth說。他的辦祖是一位哀爾蘭的紳士。曾在他住宅的。彈子房中置有一張大牀可容八人安睡是専爲賓客而設的。因爲他們晚餐旣罷。打彈爲樂。要回去時。門外都是澤地。夜行不便。就在那大牀上權宿一宵。後來旅館中就採取這個方法。置備大牀。但是到了二十世紀。旅客們都喜獨住一房。這種大牀便廢置了。</p>
<h3>宣威誄話</h3>
<p>— 陶在東</p>
<p>宣威上將軍諸曁蔣　尊。字伯器。以今年八月八日。啓手足於上海旅邸春秋五十。嗚呼哀哉辛亥革命。君爲浙江第二任都督。繼任者朱興武。予爲興武行署秘書。故多悉君行事民四。予奉公入舊京。時君爲將軍府將軍。謁談甚歡。南下爲餞。酒罷。欵予與朱葆三君密室。告以五路參案。必促成帝制。吾必出京。歸致浙人。早籌應付。未幾。果設籌安會。而君亦飄然遠引。矣民六七。予宰諸曁。君之故鄉。爲政興革。每得君助。觀雲老人。尤多所獎藉督令裁退伍年金。予呈電力諍。忏督帥幾獲讉而免。以君喬梓爲言故。後此警官斯某告予。祁奚爲公不責叔向之不謝也。民十三四間。齊盧交閧。孫夏治浙。訂君蒞杭開會歡迎予時爲杭縣。公宴之後。繼以私覿。君知首縣苦供億。謂盍圖外調。予述劉知幾史官語。相期過於周孔相待等於奴隷。今日知縣似之。等人奴耳。道外縣何擇。焉君爲啞然又明。年予去官。賣文海上。遇君於周氏之喪次。同坐陳季侃徐桂卿余鐵珊輩曁邑人。君亟稱予廉能。有勸駕意。不知予倦鳥還雲。無心出岫矣。予抱淵明　疾。遂疏懶。親友有臨存而無報謁。率累歲不一見。而吾家星如從君游。爲言君邇來凈脩持佛。門庭蕭然。疾甚時。其友李武寗視疾日三四至。至必留五百金。或千金。資醫藥。殁日又貼千金市棺衾。否則貧無以爲殮。於是諸公皆多武寗。予尤感端人之所友端也。君於革命爲先進。在軍人爲耆舊。父子文武。名重東南。五十正古人服政之年。租界豈吾曹願終地。而竟貧病以死傷已。予念生平於疇昔。自憾年老才褪。不能爲金石之文傳君。旣歎逝者。睘復自念。撮爲挽章。藉抒哀感云爾。其詞曰。革命尚未成功。殄瘁云亡。長使英雄满襟淚。爲吏極知無狀。廉能謬許。何如符讖曲鉤侯。</p>
<h3>人生二十一年</h3>
<p>— 王沿津</p>
<p>據世界人類年齡表的統計。我們普通人的年齡。大約自五十歲至七十歲。把它平均起來。可以假定爲六十歲。現在再把膳食睡眠和休息時間去掉。來算眞正的事業時間罷。</p>
<p>一。敎育時間十五年。。二休息時間七年半。（一年的休息日。假定五十天。疾病假定十天。）三。飲食時間四年八個月。（每天都拿三小時計算）。四。睡眠時間十年十一個月。（十點鐘就寑。五點鐘起牀。）五。飯後休息時間十八個月。（每次飯後休息十分鐘。）</p>
<p>除以上五項外。就是人生的事業時期。仔細算起來。不做二十一年一個月。同胞們。人生的時間這樣短。我們的使命多麽重。再不容片刻的疏忽。怠惰因循了。大家努力罷。我希望朋家剪下這張表。做我們的座右銘。</p>
<h3>觀鬥鶉記</h3>
<p>— 儉父</p>
<p>宋朱有燉元宮詞。遇着中秋時節近。翦絨花毩鬥鵪鶉。是鬥鶉之俗由來已久。固不自今日始矣。特古時以此爲戲今則以此博財。是不同耳。鬥鶉之風盛行於江北。而以毫邑爲冠。鶉之佳者。可値百餘金而所博之資。動累千萬。中等之家。因之破產。比比皆是。較諸豪門之鬥蟋。蟀殆有過之。予客秋寓毫。時値鬥鶉之期。因當局嚴禁之結果。未能公然設廠聚賭多於住戶之宅内行之。鬥時先審鶉之體質。然後論賭値。示公平也。養鶉者多置鶉於錦囊。囊底爲一橢圓形之木圈。防鶉之被壓也。鶉之春初生者。名白鷩。秋後生者。名早鵚早鵚口最毒。白鷩所不敵。凡養白鷩者。亦多不願與早鵚搏職是故也。鬥法置大篾簏於地上。將鶉由囊内放入。再撒榖於簏内。鶉見榖。則爭食而鬥矣。鬥時各竦其翼。嗚嗚作聲。爭鬥之時間。或數分鐘或十數分鐘不等。其勢均力敵者。或竟歷時許。疲憊已極。始各稍休息。努目相視。狀如怒蛙。移時。其一稍俯視。欲啄榖。其一直前猛撲之。於是酣鬥之聲復作。經此最後之惡鬥。勝敗始分。而賭値亦告判斷矣。此時鶉之勝者。則攫食。人之勝者則。攫財旣得其所謂戰勝之代價。樂乃無藝。而鶉之負者。則跳出簏外。不敢復入。人之負者。則憐物惜財。羞憤交集。狀殊狼狽。而人物之變態。至此歎觀止矣。記者因賭鬥鶉而重有感焉。夫鶉者醇也。當其在野也。得食則相呼。聞聲則相聚。日則同伏。夜則共飛。初無得失之。爭何其義耶。及經人豢養見食則相搏聞聲則仇視。以囊槖爲地盤。以畚籠爲戰域。因今日黍粟之爭。忘當時在野之義。又何其薄耶。物情之變。如是之速。亦可怪矣。</p>
<h3>北站花絮</h3>
<p>— 蘭茜</p>
<p>閱昨日本談所載綺君之「北站花絮」。各節均屬實情。憔尙有事旣重且要者未予述及。特補誌之。</p>
<p>查此次水災。遍十六省爲百年來所未嘗遭遇之奇變。上天之於下。民其爲罰也亦酷矣。余儕之居留於上海者。風和日暖。波瀾不驚。方之身當其衝之難民。衣食宿諸　無以解决者。不啻天堂地獄耳。雖然。惻隱之心。人皆有之。已饖已溺之忱。於披閱各報之記載後。能勿油然而生哉。於是兩路局長郭氏。爰有兩路全國水災募捐之發議。並聯合兩路各要員擬具募捐辦法。凡路員新資之在五十元以下者捐百分之十五。百元以下者。百分之二十。百元以上者。百分之二十。五凡各路員倘另有高見可於三日内提出云云。夫當仁不讓有心人同具焉。水災之烈。烈於毒蛇猛虎。身未遭及可以想像寗有己則飽食安居。忍聽無量數受難同胞嗷嗷待哺不加憐惜者。兩路員司。照此數集算。可得八萬元餘。然仍不免有杯水車薪之嘆。所望全上海居民。充其自愛自利之心。量力捐助。庶幾裘成集腋。而災民亦獲福無涯矣。</p>
<p>短訊　味雅酒樓。因鑒於今年各省水災爲患。近百年所罕見。老店及支店勞資全體同人。特於今日作義舉一天。將營業所入加一小賬及搞賞諸費。悉數移充水災急賑會以救災。黎雖杯水車薪。但各大商店不乏慈善之士。本人類之天職。繼續義。舉未始不能集腋成裘云。（初）</p>
<h3>印度遊記（九一）</h3>
<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>二十年一月一日。在西拉哈巴市Sllahabadu住木克已英律師處。晨乘脚車游樹林。北市空氣鮮潔。道路寛廣。大樹蔭蔽。遠勝他。市。其東面有恒河聖水。數千年來七女受洗懺罪於此。乃印度之約但河也。是日余同木律師及一富媼同往媼家。富而吝嗇已甚。信敎甚虔。延途逢廟必拜。而對車夫一錢亦不輕與。令人念迷信之無益也。向東行約五里。近火車路有大樹成行皮色蒼白。名亞休特樹。Asutar此樹在印度占大勢力崇拜者甚盛與拜牛同一需要又名母樹。乃某樹之妻。印人無敢傷母樹者。公樹可爲藥材。用途甚廣。人用之而忘愛之也。惟母樹並無何用。而印人拜之護。之有敢傷母樹者。則人羣聚而與之拼命。可殺其人也。猶之有人敢於印度敎市殺牛者。則印人聚而殺其人。猶護母親然。余問其博士及大學敎授護牛之原理。均答以吾等全家。自幼食牛乳長成。旣食其乳。又食其肉。無天理良心者。印人不爲也余甚感其言。何印度之知報恩也。余觀印度之拜母樹母牛。乃悟佛說報恩各經之來源。此報恩一點善念。已種善根於東亞。將來必遍於全球。乃可望太平也。蓋印度者乃母性敎母性文化之民族也。</p>
<p>約近午。沿途見各大小廟。均有一物置殿當中。大者如磨。小者如盤如杯最大者高七八尺。如椎立。粗可尺許其形如棒。無一廟無此物者。均以石製之。一廟中或有多種。余心久疑之。何其形似男女陰陽具交媾之狀也。余久聞羅馬有拜陽具之俗。萬慧師云。印度有拜生殖器之俗。莫非即此物乎。然在城市各廟頗難觀察。人多房黑。洞洞不易辨。比遊各鄉。靑天白日之下。乃知遍地皆是。始悟印度敎者。乃拜男女生殖器交媾之敎也。全印度大抵皆然。不過派别大同小異耳。但其形質旣坦然明白。余問印人此何。物印人曰。穈訶特瓦。意大天或大神也。大天之名見於佛經。以大天作名之男女遍地。彼以爲此爲一切神之本。一切神皆有夫妻。爲人類及萬物與自然界生生之本。此本出於大神。故須崇拜之。即天地父母之意。然更由數千年哲學家加以深奥神秘之解釋。至於不可思。議永刦不能明其學。如我中國先天道敎亦講人類生殖與天地萬物本源。儒敎周易講陰陽太極八卦。父母男女相生也。亦無可奇。不過余見印人爲裸體男女生殖器而崇拜之。爲足異耳。</p>
<h3>東北考察隨筆（二）</h3>
<p>— 劉穗九</p>
<p>敎授單獨住宅凡三村（一）東新村。（二）西新村。（三）南新村。每村各有住宅數十所。屋内裝置熱汽管。冷熱水管。洋磁便桶浴盆每所估價約一萬元。又有無線電臺一座。價値三十萬元之體育塲一所翻砂廠一所機織廠一所。價値二十四萬元之科學館一所。大圖書館一所。建築費約計三十萬元。全校現藏書籍約共七萬餘册價値一百二十萬八千餘元。理工學院現有機器及化學藥品六七千種。器械一萬六千餘件。工廠工作機械五百三十架。工具數萬件。現有敎職員二百餘。人男女學生二千餘人。全校常年經費。由四十三萬九千元增至一百三十萬餘元。規模之大。爲國内所稀有。</p>
<p>（三）北婈之瓌偉</p>
<p>東北大學之北部荓藩。有北陵在焉。即前清太宗皇帝之陵寢。建築壯麗。有同北平公園。東西有大松林。靜坐品茗。令人有世外之想。每日中外遊人不絕。然遊者多不過以名勝或公園目之。予則别感興趣太宗之文后與洪承疇艶事。至今人猶樂談論之。余初抵瀋陽。寓大南門靑年會。蓋即當時囚洪承疇處也。夫以一婦人具偉大謀略。太宗賴其内助。而得天下。誠古今史乘所罕有者矣。</p>
<p>太宗之陵曰「昭陵。」北陵者。乃通俗之稱。日人對其建築有専門研究。著有奉天昭陵圖說。計一部共百四十九頁。去歲十一月二日。日人所設之奉天圖書館開展覽會。予應該館館長衛藤利夫氏之約。前往參觀。見有昭陵内太宗文皇帝神功聖德碑拓片。及「福陵」（即東陵）太祖高皇帝神功聖德碑拓片。碑文漢满蒙三種文字並列。余往日各處訪問此種拓片而未得見。竟不意見之於日人圖書館中。幸矣。又在該館見陳列德國出。版影印之該類满蒙文碑。及喇嘛廟（如北平雍和宮中漢满蒙藏四體文大碑）碑拓片縮本多種。甚精緻。乃驚外人對吾國史乘研究之精。到則吾人之遊昭陵。豈可僅止於遊公園品茗而已哉。</p>
<p>考有清太宗文皇帝。名皇太極。太祖高皇帝努兒哈赤弟八子。攝政王多爾袞之兄。年五十二而卒。在位十七年。死後第九子順治嗣位。其陵距城約十餘里。地勢優勝。遼水右廻渾河左繞築土爲山。樓堞高聳。殿宇崢嵘。規模壯麗。與宮殿媲美。隆恩門前有最大靑方磚。名曰（丹墀。）聞有清九部官員均在此坐。班唐詩中有獨對丹墀日未斜之句。蓋指此也。隆恩殿内有太宗與文后牌位。殿内雕梁畫。梀異常精緻。殿正門前有順鋪長條翠石一塊。長約七八尺。寛約三四。尺光色斑爛奪目。洵爲難得之品銜接翠石前之台階有白色寳石台階三。塊其石質潤澤。寳光四射。連接白寳石之西側有臬藍寳石一塊。係長方形式。有清四品官員。即以此種寳石作爲臬藍頂珠之用。</p>

<h3>洋米激漲角外</h3>
<p>昨日洋米市况、交易雖不甚暢、而市形頗佳本街囤戶胃口甚佳、因滬上已受風雨之災、河下白米飛漲、北市漲一元、南市漲上六七角、故於洋米收買甚力、價乃突漲角外、計開出二號西貢一千包、價十三元半小絞三百包、價十二元九角半、又江西機元一百七十包、價十四元八角、均本街收進、洋米電報轉准小絞即裝數百噸、價六兩八錢半云、</p>

<h3>本埠昨日颶風暴雨大潮</h3>
<p>馬路積水航輪停駛</p>
<p>本埠自前晚、颶風初臨、終夕風聲震耳炎威爲之一退、市民方以爲快、昨晨彤雲密布、颶風繼續吹來、惟尙無雨意、及至午刻陣雨忽來、風聲雨、聲愈迫愈緊、而黃浦江中、大潮上泛、入晚各馬路、均有積水、形勢十分嚴重、茲將情形分誌如次、　　天文臺昨晚警報徐家匯天文臺昨晚九時、發出特别警報云、颶風顯已向舟山羣島一帶海岸襲擊、經過杭州灣、繼續向西北方面進行、至上海全境、將有極劇烈之大風與暴雨、自東北向東南而來、颶風將向上海西部吹去、</p>
<p>市中情形蕭索大風雨中、本埠各馬路情形爲之一變、低窪之區、積水没脛、甚者深可盈尺、苦風凄雨、氣象蕭索、各商店均提早收市、入晚路上行人、亦極稀少、各種交通車輛、除汽車尙可通行外、電車提早進、廠不能載客、人力車則因不敵緊風猛雨、亦多歇業、市中交通、大感困難、</p>
<p>電燈熄滅數次南市閘北兩處電、燈因電線被風吹斷、方棚損壞雖經派工修理、一時多未能恢復、故入晚以後、各馬路路燈熄滅者甚多、閘北方面、自下午五時起、熄而復明、明而復滅者、約有三次之多、南市一帶、如九畝地等處、晚十時起、全部黑暗、馬路間被風吹落之照牌窗板等、爲數頗多、法租界方面、入晚電燈亦曾熄滅、</p>

<h3>Wuhan Embankment and Sluice Gate Saved from Danger After Emergency Efforts</h3>
<p>Hankou river water has receded another three inches, now at 52 feet 7 inches on the water gauge. The Wuchang Jinshui sluice gate and Saihu embankment, as well as the Hankou Zongguan embankment, appear to be out of major danger after emergency rescue efforts. Currently, floodwater in Wuchang is being drained in eight different directions. Drainage plans in Hankou are also continuing. The Disaster Prevention Office has dispatched Police Reserve Section Chief Liu Bingchu to negotiate with the Hanxingchang Construction Company to remeasure immediately, prioritizing unobstructed traffic. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Hubei Emergency Relief Committee Sends Refugees Back to Their Hometowns</h3>
<p>Zhu Qinglan Changes Today's Trip to Hankou</p>
<p>The Hankou Emergency Relief Committee is sending refugees from various counties back to their hometowns, totaling 25,000 people. Jardine Matheson and China Merchants Steam Navigation Company are also undertaking the transport. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Zhu Qinglan's trip to Hankou was changed to the 26th by plane due to strong winds. Li Jintan, a member of the Hubei relief committee, stated that there are many disaster victims in Hubei, and urgent matters include epidemic prevention, and protection from starvation and cold. Plans have been drafted and will be implemented after Zhu arrives. Also, Wang Yanzhi, an engineer from the Yangtze River Conservancy Commission who came to Hankou with Li, has been surveying the disaster areas by plane and taking photographs and drawing maps for several days. He returned to Beijing on the 25th to report. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<p>The provincial office of the Hankou Emergency Relief Committee has been established, and Su Jingshan and Xiang Yangzhi have been appointed as executive directors. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Wuhan Experiencing Storms</h3>
<p>Many Civilian Houses Continue to Collapse</p>
<p>Water Volume Increases Again, Temperature Suddenly Drops</p>
<p>Disaster Victims Stand Helplessly with No Place to Hide</p>
<p>Last night, a violent hurricane suddenly struck Hankou at midnight. Civilian houses on China Street collapsed successively, countless small boats capsized, and debris from three broken ships drifted along the docks and riverbanks, causing many deaths and injuries. (25th Reuter's Dispatch)</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>In Hankou, brick houses and cement walls throughout the city continue to collapse due to last night's strong winds. Most of the trees were uprooted by the storm. Two cinemas on China Street collapsed, causing many deaths and injuries among refugees seeking shelter. Although the Yangtze River is currently receding, excessive waves caused by the winds and continuous heavy rain are increasing the water volume, and there is a risk of further tragedy. (25th Reuter's Dispatch)</p>
<p>Until yesterday, the temperature in Hankou reached 96 degrees. However, since last night, the temperature has suddenly dropped, reaching 67 degrees this morning, causing a sudden feeling of cold. The raging waves of the Yangtze River were swept into the concession by the hurricane. The outer walls of the Japanese Consulate, facing Mianshanzaki Street, and the outer walls of the Nisshin Oil Mill were both washed away by the raging waves. The damage is even greater in the Chinese district, but details are unclear. (25th Reuter's Dispatch)</p>
<p>In this flood, Hankou is the most severely affected. Details of the tragedy are still being investigated. The major damage in Wuchang and Hanyang is generally as follows: the Wuchang Electric Light Company is completely destroyed; the Yuhua, Zhenhuan, and First, Second, and Third Cotton Mills are completely without power; the Hanyang Electric Light Company is completely destroyed; and the Hanyang Flour Mill has only a dozen or so chimneys remaining, standing in the water. Tens of thousands of disaster victims housed on Snake Hill are standing helplessly in the rain, with no place to hide. Moreover, relief supplies are insufficient, and most have been starving for several days. Most of the civilian houses in the Chinese district are old and have mostly collapsed or are tilted. (25th Reuter's Dispatch)</p>
<h3>He Chengjun Reports on the Flood Situation in Hubei Province</h3>
<p>The Wuhan Branch of the National Flood Relief Committee held a conference yesterday afternoon at the Wuhan Headquarters. Provincial Governor He Chengjun said in his speech that out of the 69 counties in Hubei Province, 425 counties have been affected by the flood, and 39 of them are most severely affected, with 15 to 16 million disaster victims. It goes without saying that farmlands and civilian houses have been submerged and washed away, and the number of deaths and injuries is uncountable. Except for Wuhan, disaster victims in other areas have no way to receive relief and have not been sheltered at all. The tragedy is unprecedented. (25th Reuter's Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Central Propaganda Department's Appeal to the Nation for Flood Relief</h3>
<p>Nanjing: The Central Propaganda Department recently issued an appeal to the nation for flood relief. The original text reads: "Fellow countrymen, for the past six years, our party has been adhering to the teachings of the late Premier, striving to eliminate warlords and unify the country, working diligently and cautiously, fearing any negligence, and wishing to permanently secure peace and realize our doctrines so that all countrymen can ascend to prosperity and enjoy lasting happiness. Who would have thought that the more we expect, the more severe the disasters become? In recent years, natural and man-made disasters have followed one after another, with foreign troubles and internal worries arising in succession. Although the government has exhausted its efforts to remedy the situation, the people still inevitably suffer deep wounds and pain. This is because the majority of the people have not yet recognized the perilous situation our country is in and are not very concerned about the survival and well-being of the nation. Therefore, the people cannot work together to overcome disasters and pursue achievements. Our party believes that the key to the survival of the Chinese nation and the success or failure of the national revolution must be repeatedly told to prompt the attention of our fellow countrymen.</p>
<p>In recent years, calamities have arrived in succession. Last year, the Northwest suffered a severe drought, with tens of thousands of miles of barren land and countless people dying and being displaced. The wounds have not yet healed and still await relief. This year, various inland provinces have again suffered from continuous rain, causing dikes to collapse and rivers to burst, resulting in floods that have engulfed mountains and hills, destroying houses and submerging people and livestock. The magnitude of the disaster is too tragic to describe. For example, in Yutang, Hunan Province, thousands of people were swept away by the waves. The once prosperous three towns of Ezhou have suddenly become a watery land. Other areas, such as northern Anhui and large areas of southern Jiangsu, are all一片汪洋弥望无际, with the flooding of the Yangtze and Han rivers showing no sign of stopping, and the vast expanse of Yu's legacy is in danger of being submerged. The dead tragically perish in the bellies of fish, while the living are reduced to starving people. This is truly a major change for the nation and a extraordinary disaster for the people, which we cannot ignore in the slightest. The extent of the disaster this time is nationwide, with reports received successively from 16 provinces and regions, including Hunan, Hubei, Guangdong, and Anhui, accounting for more than two-thirds of the country's area. The number of victims is at least 50 million or more. Currently, the floodwaters in various places have not subsided slightly, and the provinces of Hebei and Shandong are also showing signs of danger. The scope of the disaster will be unknowable. As for the loss of life and property, there are no precise statistics and cannot be listed in advance. The Ministry of the Interior is sending personnel to inspect in different directions, and we can obtain an alarming report on the latest situation in terms of losses. Moreover, the disaster-stricken areas are mostly agricultural areas, such as Hunan and Hubei provinces, which are major rice-producing areas. The food supply for most provinces depends on these areas. Now, suffering this extraordinary disaster, cultivated land has been submerged, and green seedlings have been washed away. The country has suddenly lost the supply of this huge amount of food, and future years of famine are inevitable. How to provide relief to disaster victims and how to prevent famine are both issues that must be resolved immediately.</p>
<p>Currently, hundreds of millions of disaster victims have no place to live, and their cries of distress can be heard everywhere, waiting to be fed. Arranging for emergency relief is a matter of urgency. In view of the severity of the current disaster, the central government has established a Flood Relief Committee to coordinate actions and jointly formulate solutions, and has widely invited Chinese and foreign people to manage the affairs to gather ideas widely. A 20 million yuan disaster relief public bond is being planned in detail, and the issuance date will not be far away. With funds and people in charge, the relief work will be carried out more quickly, and the benefits to the disaster victims will be substantial. At the same time, in view of the destruction of farmland, we will also plan to make remedies for future years of famine. All these relief measures by the government are somewhat comforting to the people of the country. However, the disaster is severe and the scope is broad. If we rely solely on government relief, our financial resources will be limited, and there is a fear of focusing on one thing while neglecting others. We hope that our fellow countrymen across the country will show compassion and sympathy, or offer opinions to the government for implementation, or generously donate money to help the relief efforts, or organize groups to solicit donations to provide relief. In short, we hope to jointly reduce unnecessary waste and provide relief to our disaster-stricken compatriots. When people speak of profit, they should rally and respond. By gathering a little, we can make a big difference. This depends on the joint support of our fellow countrymen and is what the government is eagerly hoping for.</p>
<p>There have been many disturbances, and it is not easy to deal with them. Obstacles arise one after another, and it takes time to overcome them. Therefore, there are troubles everywhere, and the flames of war have not yet subsided. Military operations are seen from time to time, and construction is impossible. Now the military districts are looking forward to rehabilitation, and the communist bandits still need to be wiped out. The massacre of Wanxian has not yet been resolved, and the unprecedented flood has arrived again. Therefore, today's China is really surrounded by natural disasters, man-made calamities, internal worries, and external insults. It is a time of crisis and survival. We still hope that our fellow countrymen across the country will recognize the environment, unite to assist the government, and work hard to provide emergency relief so that the people waiting to be fed can prolong their breath, to treat the symptoms. Wipe out the communist bandits, eliminate the rebels, secure the country internally, resist external aggression, and strive for construction, to treat the root causes. It is necessary to manage both the symptoms and the root causes and take care of both sides to relieve the disaster and enter the path of construction, accomplish the revolution, and reach a rich and strong nation. At this time of natural and man-made disasters, which are coming one after another, the survival of our nation and country depends on it. All citizens must not sit idly by and must support the central government and strive to salvage the situation, unite sincerely, and face the crisis together. If anyone is ignorant of this meaning, indulges in wickedness, disregards the difficulties of the country and the people, and indulges in creating chaos and rejoicing in disaster, it is tantamount to helping the wicked and adding insult to injury. Not only will the current disaster be unable to be rescued, but the collapse of the Chinese nation can be expected. The opportunity for survival is imminent, and rewards and punishments are self-inflicted. Let us reflect on these words repeatedly, which our fellow countrymen must be deeply vigilant about. Today, our Chinese nation is truly on the brink of death. Whether we live or die, whether we face disaster or blessing, will depend on the final efforts of our fellow countrymen. Heaven helps those who help themselves, and adversity makes a nation strong. Starting from humble beginnings, Chu used this to become strong, and enduring hardship, Yue used this to prosper. The previous examples are not far away, and the future can be pursued. I hope that our fellow countrymen across the country will rise up and work hard." (25th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Xu Yongchang Arrives in Beiping; Yan Xishan Fundamentally Unwilling to Ask About Politics Again</h3>
<p>Beiping: Xu Yongchang, Yang Aiyuan, Ge Jingen, and others arrived in Beiping this morning. Bao Wen樾, Wang Ping, Huang Lushu, and others came with them. Han Fuju, Jiang Bocheng, Tang Guozhen, and others all welcomed them at the station. Xu Yongchang told reporters that he came to Beiping this time because he was summoned by telegram from the deputy commander and had something to report. Mr. Yan returned to Shanxi and arrived in Datong by plane on the 5th. Zhou Dai arrived in Datong on the 6th to welcome him. Yang Aiyuan, Gu Renfa, and others had met him at Hebian Village one after another. He went to Hebian Village twice. The summary of Yan's conversation was nothing more than two points: (1) Yan fundamentally does not want to ask about politics again. (2) Yan's father is already over seventy years old, and Yan has lived in Dalian for a long time and misses him very much, so Yan has to go home. Yan repeatedly stated that he is willing to be an ordinary person in the Shanxi countryside because he is often surrounded in Dalian and does not want to be restricted by outsiders. When I was in Beiping before, I asked all parties to send a telegram to the central government to request amnesty for Yan, but this matter may not be easy to handle. Yan also expressed to Bao and Ge that he does not ask about politics. Feng Yuxiang originally traveled between Xinjiang and Quwo. Since Song Zheyuan's troops were withdrawn, he now lives in Fenyang and has not met Yan. Sun Dianying is now in Taiyuan. The central government will transfer the Shanxi army to suppress bandits. A telegram was recently sent to Gu Renfa, and Gu has gone to Beijing to present everything in person. The communist bandits in Fuping have fled to Zuo Yun, Youyu, and other places in Shanxi. The county magistrate of Fangcheng County was also kidnapped by the communists, and they are now being suppressed. Shanxi banknotes are exchanged at a rate of 3.67 yuan per silver dollar. I will visit the Deputy Commander today and tomorrow to ask for instructions on the policy of governing Shanxi and plan to stay in Beiping for a few more days. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping: Ge Jingen said that he went to Shanxi this time to observe the situation because he was ordered by Chairman Zhuang. On the 21st, he met Yan at Baifotang and did not see Yan practicing Buddhism. Yan told me that he did not want to live in Dalian for a long time and was worried about his old father, so he returned to Shanxi, but he would not ask about politics. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Taiyuan: Ge, Bao, Xu, Yang, Liu Guang, and others left Bing at noon on the 23rd, and all the generals saw them off in the rain. According to Ge, his impression this time was excellent. The people of Shanxi are loyal and simple. If the politics can be on track, the people of Shanxi are very easy to obey. The generals of Shanxi have a deep understanding of the general situation and their observations of the current situation are very accurate. The rumors are completely inconsistent with the truth. Hearing is not as good as seeing, this is true. Visiting Yan in Wutai was a private visit, and Yan's attitude was very frank, expressing that he had no political activities. Regarding leaving Shanxi, it will be decided after I arrive in Beiping and negotiate with the Deputy Commander, and it will definitely be done soon. Yang said that Xu went to Beiping to report the political situation in Shanxi Province to Zhang and asked for instructions on the administrative policy. I am visiting the Deputy Commander because he is ill. (24th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Great Wind and Rain</h3>
<p>The people of Shanghai have been doing their utmost to exert their enthusiasm and courage to engage in the rescue of flood victims in various provinces and to resist what is called a natural disaster. They did not expect that a natural disaster would suddenly strike the people of our entire city. The wind and rain were so fierce that they were like galloping horses, and all traffic on the roads, postal service, and telecommunications was almost completely cut off. As the reporter writes, the tide of the Huangpu River is still rolling towards the road. In an instant, most of the roads are already ankle-deep, and the wind is still roaring. Judging from the current situation, the losses in this city, such as the destruction of houses, the flooding of goods, and the disruption of all traffic, are incalculable. If we consider the provinces that were affected by the great wind and rain, Jiangsu and Zhejiang bore the brunt, and the cotton fields and crops will be swept away. The suffering and losses are especially imaginable. The people of Jiangsu and Zhejiang will disregard all sacrifices to save the refugees in the disaster-stricken provinces. But after suffering this great wind and rain, a large number of disaster victims have suddenly increased. They are relying on the people of Jiangsu and Zhejiang to reduce their remaining food and transport it to the disaster areas to save the refugees. However, due to the impact of this great wind and rain, there will also be problems with the people's food supply. Alas, why is Heaven so unkind, causing our people to be in such a desperate situation? Looking again at the phenomena in various provinces, Wuhan suffered street houses collapsing, docks being destroyed, and people being killed and injured again due to last night's hurricane and rainstorm. It is unknown how much this has increased. The Kangtun Min embankment of the Yellow River in Shandong is reporting alarms, and the dikes everywhere are still in danger. Disaster is still unknown to reach what point. The people of Jiangsu and Zhejiang bear the heavy responsibility of saving others, and now they bear the heavy responsibility of saving themselves. How can they muster a hundredfold courage to achieve the goal of saving both others and themselves? How will our government put forth its enthusiasm for saving the country and the people to save this great calamity? Alas, this concerns the survival of our nation, not a trivial matter.</p>
<h3>The Change of the British Labour Cabinet</h3>
<p>The economic recession in the world in recent years has plunged all the nations of the world into a state of desolation. Even the United States, which is known as a gold standard country, is no exception. Before the Great War, Britain controlled the center of the world economy. After the Great War, the United States actually took its place and replaced it. The fact has proven that the advanced capitalist country of the British Empire has shown the old age of the setting sun. Until recently, it encountered the great difficulty of the global recession, and Britain was even more troubled. Overseas trade is declining day by day, and industry is declining day by day. The heavy taxes stifle the entrepreneurial spirit of the people and exhaust the purchasing power of the people. As a result, workers' unemployment is becoming increasingly radical. How to relieve unemployed workers is the current big issue and difficult hurdle.</p>
<p>The British Labour Party is known as a political party that represents the interests of labour. Since 1929, when MacDonald was elected to form a cabinet, it has been in power for three years. In the face of the phenomenon that the number of unemployed workers is increasing sharply and the national finances are unable to make ends meet, even MacDonald's long-sleeved dance has exhausted itself by (1) increasing taxes (2) issuing public bonds (3) reducing expenditures, and even reducing the expenditures for relieving unemployed workers as a countermeasure for relief. Since he convened a joint meeting of the party leaders of the Liberal and Conservative parties and established a temporary truce treaty, he has tried his best to seek the support of the opposition party. We have long seen that he is unable to cope with the difficult times. Since the division occurred within his party, the Mosley faction left the party together and formed a new party. We had long expected that the fate of his cabinet would be difficult to support. Although MacDonald once resolutely made the bold statement that "the stability of Britain is as stable as the Bank of England," the financial situation was at a loss. Faced with accusations from the enemy party and the division among his comrades, MacDonald's last bold statement was just his last struggle.</p>
<p>As expected, according to the current news, MacDonald has already submitted his resignation and presented it to the Emperor to summon the leaders of the Conservative and Liberal parties to discuss the formation of a new cabinet. A national government composed of the three parties is about to appear, and many Labour Party cabinet members have also expressed their refusal to join the new government. Although all of this was already in our expectations, it is still one of the most memorable pages in the history of the British government.</p>
<p>Britain has always been a country that upholds party politics. Initially, the Conservative and Liberal parties took turns in power. By 1924, the Labour Party rose and formed a tripartite situation. In normal times, the three parties each have strict portals, consistent steps, each holding their own views, and each having their own political opinions. If one party advances, the other party retreats, and it will never be mixed to form a cabinet unless it is absolutely necessary. Now, the three parties are internally divided in various forms, with factions standing in a forest of divisions and opinions, unable to maintain their unified pace in Parliament. A mixed cabinet will inevitably arise in response to the times. Or the form of the three parties taking turns in power will gradually decline in Britain from now on. Secondly, in the situation of the collapse of the Labour cabinet, the credibility of MacDonald and Finance Minister Snowden has obviously been shaken. The cracks inside them are even more profound. In the future, the British Labour movement may also gradually decline as the sun passes noon. Furthermore, Britain is a country that upholds party politics and parliamentary politics. Currently, there are more and more parties, and their political views are different. What is expressed on the political stage in the future is likely to be even more unpredictable. Therefore, this change of the Labour cabinet is truly worthy of attention in the political history of England.</p>
<p>However, the current economic recession in the world, the severity of the unemployment problem, and the nations of the world have felt helpless. Germany has already made a final plea for help to the world. The unemployment of seven million workers in the United States has also become a huge hurdle and will also become a major issue in the next election. What about Italy? The trend of the times and the compulsion of force have presented their political twists and changes due to the shift in economic power, and it is not only Britain.</p>

<p>Important Foreign Telegrams</p>
<h3>MacDonald Commissioned to Form National Government</h3>
<p>Leaders of three parties cooperating sincerely, cabinet member list under discussion.</p>
<p>After the objectives of the new government are achieved, each party will resume its respective position.</p>
<p>Henderson is organizing a new Labour Party, and will launch fierce attacks on MacDonald.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 24th - An announcement was issued from 10 Downing Street tonight, stating that the new government is not a so-called coalition government in the usual sense, but a cooperative government. Its sole purpose is to deal with the current national emergency. Since undertaking the task of forming a new government, MacDonald has been consulting with Baldwin, Samuel, and Snowden on the list of new cabinet members. Significant progress has been made. After the objectives of the new government are achieved, each party will resume its respective position. Parliament is expected to convene around September 8 to quickly rectify the excess of expenditures over income, and proposals for thrift and revenue generation will be submitted to Parliament at that time. Not only is the business and welfare of Britain, but also a large part of the business and welfare of the civilized world, built upon the credit of the pound sterling. Therefore, the new government will take any necessary measures to maintain this credit and prevent it from falling. Prime Minister MacDonald has submitted the resignation of his cabinet to the King. The King accepted the resignation and instructed MacDonald to form a national government on a broad basis to cope with the current financial difficulties. MacDonald accepted the mandate and is now consulting with Baldwin and Samuel on cooperation in forming a cabinet. Baldwin published an article explaining the Conservative Party's attitude, stating that the current crisis facing the country requires a swift response. Dissolving Parliament and holding new elections at this time would be inappropriate. Therefore, the Conservative Party has agreed to join the national government for a limited period. Its specific purpose is to implement a plan to balance the budget and restore the nation's financial credit. There is no question of a permanent coalition. In organizing a national government to handle a specific event, there is no need for any political party to sacrifice any principles it believes in.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 25th - The tense political atmosphere of the past few days is gradually clearing, and Londoners are somewhat relieved. Except for those who support the trade unions, the people of the country are satisfied. Henderson, as a leader of the trade unions and a member of the wartime coalition government, is an old hand who has managed the parliamentary Labour Party machinery with strict discipline for many years. Now he resolutely turns away, unwilling to accept a second chance to jointly handle the nation's new crisis with different parties. He will be the leader of the Labour Party, based on the support of the trade unions, the nine resigned cabinet members, and about 200 rigid members of Parliament. Figures like Gen. Lyte, Klein, Alexandria, and Lansbury are all prominent figures in the former cabinet. With their assistance, Henderson can become a strong force. The new Labour Party now plans to launch fierce attacks in Parliament against MacDonald's economic proposals, and denounce MacDonald as a traitor. Therefore, the extraordinary meeting of the House of Commons will be the most scathing and disruptive gathering in the history of Parliament. The Daily Herald, the Labour Party's most powerful newspaper, with a circulation of over one million copies, has now declared its opposition to MacDonald. However, many people believe that MacDonald's decision to form a new cabinet is a great patriotic and selfless act by a statesman, which will be admired by later generations. Moreover, the new national government is different from a coalition government, it is merely an executive body convened to handle a specific event. Once the emergency plan has been implemented, this temporary body formed by integrating different parties will be dissolved, and the new government will find its footing in the ordinary context of party politics. What will MacDonald's position be at that time? The announcement issued by 10 Downing Street on Monday night has already explained this, namely that after the objectives of the new government are achieved, each party will resume its respective position. Now, let us briefly describe the situation MacDonald is in. On August 1, the Parliamentary Economic Committee, led by Sir May, issued a report stating that if government departments do not immediately make large cuts in spending, the budget deficit will reach £120 million. At the same time, British cash is flowing out of the country, and France, in view of London's financial position, is withdrawing large amounts of cash. The Bank of England suddenly raised interest rates, which are four and a half percent higher than those of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which is one and a half percent, a far cry. To remedy this situation, it is necessary for all classes to make equal sacrifices and to clean up unemployment relief expenses. Thus, the Labour Party was destroyed by the unemployment relief issue. After many days of hard negotiations, MacDonald realized during a cabinet meeting on Sunday night that he could not control the cabinet. Henderson and others were unwilling to abandon the close relationship with the trade unions. Seeing the insistence of the General Council of the Trades Union Congress not to yield to MacDonald, MacDonald clearly understood the truth of the overall situation and resolutely decided to temporarily join hands with the two different parties and put his own career, the British Labour Party, and the entire existing orientation of British party politics into the melting pot. Standing by MacDonald's side is the steadfast Chancellor of the Exchequer Snowden. Snowden strongly opposes the immediate inclusion of tax rates in the temporary plan, which is also a sign that the cooperation between the Labour Party and the Conservative Party is short-term in nature. Overseas Territories Minister Thomas also did not abandon MacDonald. The position of these three people seems to be the same as that of the pre-war radical Liberal Party. However, the backbone of the Labour Party, the trade union members, who once supported MacDonald to power, will now squeeze him down. Yesterday afternoon, MacDonald continued to meet with Baldwin, Sankey, Neville Chamberlain, Reading, and others. MacDonald told Reuters reporters that everything was progressing well. MacDonald smiled at the crowd when he left Downing Street for the palace. The King ordered MacDonald to form a new national government. MacDonald kissed the King's hand and accepted the mandate. Parliament will convene a special session on September 8. Telegrams have been sent to summon all members of Parliament. However, it is speculated that the new government will submit to Parliament a plan to generate revenue and reduce expenditure, roughly reducing government expenditure by £68 million and introducing new taxes of £52 million to offset the budget deficit of £120 million. Londoners were delighted to hear of this development. Government bonds and the prices of major industrial securities have risen. As for how the new cabinet members will be assigned, opinions vary before official news is released. As far as everyone knows, the number of new cabinet members is limited, like the famous cabinets during the war, about ten or twelve people, rather than the twenty-one of the Labour cabinet. The Conservative Party and the Labour Party each occupy four seats, and the remaining seats belong to the Liberal Party. Baldwin will serve as Lord President of the Council. Among the Conservative Party's leading figures, those with the most hope of joining the cabinet are Samuel, Reading, and Maclay. MacDonald has the assistance of Snowden, Thomas, and Sankey. India Affairs Minister Benn is also still loyal to MacDonald. Colonial Secretary Passfield stated that he has long had the ambition to retire from political life and engage in writing and academic research, and will take this opportunity to fulfill his long-cherished wish. Passfield is currently seventy-three years old.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 25th - This morning, all London newspapers except the Labour Party organ, the Daily Herald, unanimously expressed their satisfaction with the resolution of the political crisis and praised MacDonald and Snowden's courage and patriotism, valuing the country over the party and prioritizing national affairs without regard for personal considerations. This shows the democracy of Britain.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 24th - Britain's major labour organizations and trade unions are scheduled to hold a special meeting tomorrow to discuss the new situation of the Labour Party. The trade unions have stated that the trade unions' assistance to the government will naturally cease with the resignation of the cabinet.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 25th - Thomas has decided to follow MacDonald in forming a new government to implement an emergency plan to save the country's economic crisis. However, Thomas was originally a member of the General Council of the Trades Union Congress. The Trades Union Congress was instrumental in enabling him to enter the Labour Party's political arena. He has been the Secretary-General of the Transport and General Workers' Union for many years. He temporarily resigned from his trade union position when he entered the Labour cabinet. If he once left the cabinet, he would resume his original position. However, Thomas, considering the overall situation, has abandoned his personal considerations and decided to confront the trade unions. Today, Thomas spent two and a half hours in earnest conversation with his trade union members. He later told Reuters reporters that he would contribute what he could to help the country safely navigate the current difficulties, regardless of his own consequences. This is the responsibility that everyone should fulfill. I am well aware that my actions will cause misunderstandings and may even cause censure.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 24th - The news of the formation of a national government in Britain has created a very good impression in political and securities market circles here. Newspapers have praised the leaders of the Conservative and Liberal parties for their mutual forbearance for the sake of the country in joining the new government.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 24th - Wall Street now holds a hopeful view of the British situation. The news of the British government's resignation has not caused a major impact. The pound is stable, opening at 4.85 and fourteen-sixteenths, then falling by one-sixteenth, but closing at the previous price. The evening newspapers all write extensively about the British political crisis, but the tone is quite friendly.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 25th - Several of the most powerful bankers here today asked the New York Times to announce that if the new British government wants to borrow huge sums from American private banks, it only needs to notify them 24 hours in advance, and the loans can be obtained. A guiding report stated that if Britain needs to borrow money, the United States can lend £80 million. A telegram from London stated that according to a London newspaper, the American Federal Reserve Bank is willing to continue lending to the Bank of England as long as the United States can complete the reduction of government spending on unemployment insurance. Bankers here are very concerned about this news, but this news has not been confirmed at present, and the authorities have not denied it.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 24th - The U.S. government is closely monitoring the British political situation and naturally refrains from making hasty comments. It is reported that the U.S. disarmament plan will not be affected by this, as all British political leaders, regardless of party affiliation, are regarded here as firm supporters of the disarmament policy.</p>
<h3>The Vatican Protests Against the Anti-Religious Tide in Spain</h3>
<p>National Society, Rome, 24th - The Vatican has decided to lodge a serious protest against the Spanish Republican government's unilateral abolition of Catholicism. The protest letter has been drafted by the Vatican Secretary of State, Cardinal Pacelli, and submitted to the Pope for approval. It will be sent to Madrid tonight by special envoy. The content of the protest letter is said to be that the Vatican considers all measures taken by the Spanish government against the Catholic Church to be illegal, and declares that religious groups in Spain should have the right to reside, manage, and own property. The Spanish government should be fully responsible for any damage suffered by church personnel and their property as a result of this illegal policy.</p>

<p>The Huaiyin County Flood Relief Association Appeals to Shanghai Shenbao for Urgent Aid: Huaiyin is a poor and barren land, and has suffered from disasters and famines in recent years. Moreover, last year it suffered a terrible bandit robbery, and the people's strength has been exhausted. This spring, the wheat suffered from frost and drought, and the harvest was meager. Since summer, the weather has been timely, and the rice seedlings have grown luxuriantly. It was hoped that there would be a good autumn harvest and the people's difficulties would be slightly alleviated. How could it have been that since July, continuous rain has led to flooding of Hong Lake, which has been increasing daily and has not stopped. Initially, various sections of the lake beach were successively submerged. Now it has even reached the Taihuang Dam. Areas 2, 6, and 7 are all under water. Boats travel above the houses in Shunheji. Towns such as Zhangjiaxu, Zhaojiaji, Xiaoqiao Town, Tanghe, Jiubao, Taozha, Chenji, Xiaowangji, Wuji, and Zhengchang are all three to five feet deep in water. The south of the Grand Canal in Area 1 has suffered repeated flooding from the breaches in Huai'an 5, 6, 7, 8, Wanban, Yangjiamiao, Chahe, and Wanjii. Houses and sorghum have mostly collapsed into the water. Six hundred thousand acres of good farmland have all been turned into habitats for fish. Cooking smoke has ceased, and there is no sound of chickens and dogs. Only treetops and rooftops can be seen swaying amidst the frightened waves. Hundreds of thousands of victims are living in the open on the Taihuang and Hong Lake Dams. Such a tragic situation is unprecedented in a hundred years. Recently, a flood relief committee has been organized by local communities to first raise funds and select the most needy for relief. However, the disaster area is too wide and there are too many victims. A drop in the bucket is of no help. For this reason, we exhaustively report the disaster situation and appeal to all great philanthropists to send personnel to rush to provide urgent aid so that we can barely survive and avoid the extreme urgency of waiting for death. The Huaiyin Flood Relief Committee, He Zhoucheng, Li Yushu, Wang Shuxiang, Zhou Yuankai, Ni Jiafu, Han Zhao, Qian Danquan, Zhang Lupin, Fu Bingqi, etc. gratefully kowtow.</p>
<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Russian Citizens Arbitrarily Move Boundary Markers on the Northeast Border</h3>
<p>Encroaching on Our Country's Territory and Expelling Our Country's Farmers</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence, Suifenhe News, The Fifth General Department of the Special Police learned some time ago that the Soviet Union had privately moved the northern border stone marker in the territory of Dongning County. It specially sent a commissioner to secretly investigate. According to the report, it is said that in the area north of Dongning County, Dongdachuan Wengan Dingzi, the Soviet Union privately moved the Japanese character boundary marker of the national border westward, encroaching on our territory by two or three li or four or five li. The farmers who had been cultivating in that area for many years were told by several Russian cavalrymen that they were occupying and cultivating their land, and they forcibly expelled the farmers with force. More than fifty farmers argued with them, but the Russian soldiers did not listen, arrested several farmers, and seized horses and oxen, etc., and detained them in the Russian territory for many days. They forced each farmer to sign a statement that they would no longer cultivate the land before releasing them. However, the farmer Zhang Zenggui refused to sign because his fields, houses, and tombs were all in that area, and he has been detained by the Russians to this day. Also, in Taipinggou, 20 li north of Dongning City and Dachuan, on a hillside about 2.5 li west of the old national border, several new wooden posts were discovered that had been buried by the Soviets. Russian border characters and Arabic numeral "1" were written on them, and they were covered with loose soil, intending to pretend that they had been buried for a long time. The Dongning County government discovered this, sent personnel to pull them out, and burned them. However, in various places south of Dongning County, the border markers have recently been secretly removed by the Russians and thrown into the valleys. The national border markers have been buried, and it is no longer possible to distinguish between the Russian and Chinese areas. The Dongning County Magistrate has already telegraphed the Provincial Government for instructions. On the one hand, a protest has been lodged with the Russian officials, demanding the rescue and release of the farmers (19th).</p>
<h3>The Yalu River Water Level Rises, but the Crisis Has Passed</h3>
<p>Severe Flooding in Western Korea</p>
<p>Andong Correspondence, From the beginning of this month to the 20th, continuous rain continued for two weeks. The Yalu River, both upstream and downstream, rose in water level, with turbulent waves and overflowing floods. Residents and merchants in this port were worried that the flood disaster of the 12th year of the Republic of China would strike again and were all wary. On the 16th, from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM, the tide was at its highest, and the river rose to its most dangerous level. According to measurements taken by personnel sent by the county government, the average water level on that morning was one zhang, seven or eight chi. Low-lying areas in the city had become a swamp. The Jiang'an Bridge area outside the city was flooded with water about four chi deep or more on the morning of the 15th, and nearby merchants and residents were cut off from transportation. At the same time, six or seven sailboats were there to carry merchants and residents to the city for refuge. The Japanese and Korean residents of the nearby Jiang'an Tong area were moved to shelters under the command of the Japanese police to avoid disaster. During the three days of the 14th, 15th and 16th, when the water level rose sharply, the Andong County Office dispatched Yin Section Chief to supervise section chiefs and staff to patrol the river embankment in groups and dispatched special personnel to defend each sluice gate. The Yalu River Logging Company reported by telegram from the upstream branch offices during the three days of the 14th, 15th and 16th that on the 14th, the Maishitai water level rose one zhang, the Waichagou water level rose seven chi, and the Baicaidi water level rose one zhang and two chi. On the 15th, the Baicaidi water level continued to rise three chi, and the Waichagou water level continued to rise five chi. On the 16th, the Waichagou water level rose another five chi, and the Baicaidi water level rose another seven chi. The Maishitai water level continued to rise five chi. After 2:00 PM on the 16th, reports of receding water levels began to arrive one after another. The water level of the Yalu River upstream and downstream has turned from danger to safety.</p>
<p>As for the left bank of the Yalu River in western Korea, within Ping'an Province, rivers that flow directly into the Yalu River have been suffering. On the 14th, 15th and 16th, the water level rose sharply, exceeding the water level of the rivers within Yizhou County on the right bank of the Yalu River by about one zhang. In Jianchang County, the water level in the Jiayanli area rose about seven chi. In Bitong County, the Douman River rose nine chi. Long-distance automobiles traveling to and from the area were temporarily suspended starting on the 14th. Automobiles traveling from Weiyuan County to Chushan were also suspended starting on the 14th. The Anman Motor Road near Manpu Town was washed away in more than ten places on the 13th. Automobiles traveling in both directions were immediately suspended. In Cicheng County, the Cicheng River rose eight chi on the 15th. In Jiangjie County, the Tulu River rose nine chi. The bridge in Beigong Township was washed away in fourteen dong. According to a survey by the Ping'an Province Office, the losses in its jurisdiction during these three days are at least over 350,000. On the 15th, at the Jichuan Township ferry in Chushan County, two Korean youths were crossing the river and tragically drowned in the middle. On the 15th, rocks near Songdong Village in Jiangdong Township, Taishan County, suddenly collapsed, crushing a family of five, old and young, from the family of Korean Kim Kwang-chang. Director of the Incheon Customs, Tanaka Hidesaburo, returned on the afternoon of the 17th in a car with a certain geisha. The driver stepped on the gas, but failed to stop when he reached the river bank. With a crash, the car fell into the river. The driver was lucky enough to escape, but Customs Director Tanaka and the geisha were tragically drowned together. After days of rain, plague has been discovered in the western part of Korea, and many have died. The Ping'an Province Office has dispatched many government doctors to go in the rain to prevent the epidemic (21st).</p>
<h3>After the Harbin Navigation Joint Bureau Concluded</h3>
<p>丨Merchant ships organize transportation offices still unite丨</p>
<p>Profits of two million yuan in the first half of the year.</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence. This spring, in order to promote unity in the Songhua River shipping industry, there was an organization to expand the Joint Navigation Bureau. However, due to conflicts of interest, it was opposed by merchant groups in 14 counties along the Songhua, Heihe, and Wusuli Rivers. After half a year of mutual criticism, the Political Committee ordered the expanded joint navigation to be temporarily concluded at the end of last month and reconsidered next year. Thus, the Joint General Bureau of Shipping, a cooperation between officials and merchants, concluded yesterday. According to Mr. Wang Shize, the manager of the Northeast Shipping Bureau, about the closure of the Joint Navigation and the current state of shipping, it is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Closure of the Joint Bureau of Official and Merchant Navigation. After the official and merchant Joint Shipping Bureau was ordered to close, the general merchant shareholders believed that it would not be easy to close the accounts and procedures in the middle, and asked the Northeast Shipping Bureau to request the Northeast authorities to allow a grace period until the river was closed, but it was still rejected. Therefore, the merchants despaired and had to proceed with the closure. Considering the nature of the shipping industry, it is different from other industries. The ships set sail with different distances to be traveled, and it would not be easy to change the situation after a morning of closure. After many discussions among the shipping companies, it was decided that August 15 would be the standard date for closure. Before this date, all ships would return to their home ports and would only be allowed to set sail after the closure. From April 23, when the Joint Navigation was established, to August 1, when the ships returned to their ports, the total profit for the half year was 2 million yuan. According to the shares of the ships that joined, each share could earn 0.35 yuan. However, because 500,000 yuan in outstanding debts had not been recovered, the actual profit distribution was only 25%. By August 14, the closure of each ship was completed and they were free to set sail. However, the Joint Navigation still had many events and procedures that had not been cleared, so it was not completely closed. Four ships sailing to the Jilin area were stranded in Jilin due to shallow water and have not returned. They will be closed separately in the future. A small number of personnel are still working in the Joint Navigation, and their salaries are scheduled to be paid until the end of the month. If the work cannot be completed by the end of the month, a few more people will be retained to handle it. In addition, a sailboat has a one-year lease relationship with the Joint Navigation Bureau. Due to the termination of the contract midway, it demanded more rent and has not been resolved to this day.</p>
<p>The current trend of shipping. After the closure of the large joint navigation bureau, the official ships will still be managed by the Northeast Shipping Bureau without much problem. Commercial ships are relatively difficult because although the general shipowners secretly grumbled when they joined the Joint Navigation, they sincerely wished the Joint Navigation to continue so that they could save their efforts. The dissolution of the official and merchant Joint Shipping Bureau and the management of their own business at this time is quite</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>inconvenient. Therefore, some are still conducting on a smaller scale, forming a group of commercial ships to maintain it until the river is closed. However, most of the shipowners with appeal are passive and unwilling to take responsibility. At present, only the former Deputy Manager of the Grand Joint Navigation Bureau, Fu Zhongchen, is the General Manager, and the Chairman of the Board is Song Wenlin. The organization is named the Commercial Shipping Office, and is internally divided into two sections, temporarily working in the Ship Industry Association. The first batch of united ships has set sail. Whether the union will be consolidated will depend on the success of this trip. When the Joint Navigation Bureau existed, all parties attacked it with all their might due to different interests. There are several things that are most regrettable after its cancellation. (1) Remote routes, such as Jilin and Xingkai Lake, will never have ship service. (2) It is inconvenient to transport refugees, with officials and merchants shirking responsibility, unlike the convenience when the Joint Navigation Bureau existed. (3) It is not as convenient as before to transport military supplies. There are many other inconveniences that are difficult to achieve without the power of the large joint navigation. Therefore, the cancellation of this shipping union is extremely regrettable in terms of promoting benefits and facilitating the people (21st).</p>
<h3>Remarks by Han Fuju After Arriving in Beiping</h3>
<p>Yan Xishan's Return Has No Significant Impact</p>
<p>Mr. Feng Will Eventually Have to Go Abroad</p>
<p>Han Immediately Visits Zhang Xueliang at the Hospital</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Han Fuju, Chairman of Shandong Provincial Government, arrived in Beiping at 9:15 AM on the 22nd, having traveled north by special train from Jinan at 3:00 PM on the 21st due to the pacification of Hebei's military affairs and the need to discuss post-war arrangements in North China. Those accompanying Han included Jiang Bocheng, Song Shiyan, Chief of Staff Liu Shuxiang, Secretary-General Zhang Shaotang, Director of Industry Wang Fangting, Jinan Mayor Wen Chenglie, and many important military officials, along with two companies of guards. Han made the following remarks that day: "I have come to visit the Deputy Commander because he has recovered from his illness. The Deputy Commander also sent a telegram requesting my presence, so I came to Beiping to meet him, seek instructions on post-war arrangements in North China, and show domestic and foreign reactionaries that the more they provoke, the closer the generals in North China become. My stay in Beiping will depend on the Deputy Commander's wishes, but I plan to stay for a week and also visit Henan. I do not plan to go to Nanjing for the time being. As for post-war arrangements in North China, everything is under the guidance of the Commander-in-Chief and Deputy Commander. I am only doing my best within my responsibilities. Yan Xishan's return to Shanxi, outwardly expressing that he will not interfere in politics, is probably because it is too late. He cannot express his political views any longer. Last year, he had great power but was still unable to do anything. Now he only has tired soldiers from Shanxi Province and can do nothing. Moreover, the Shanxi army may not even be used by him. Therefore, Yan Xishan's return to Shanxi has no significant impact. As long as the generals in North China unite and sincerely support the Central Government, Yan will have to leave even if he doesn't want to. As for Mr. Feng Yuxiang, he will eventually have to go abroad because he has no army in Shanxi. Now, ten bandits could kidnap him. With Mr. Feng's character, he would never want to deal with bandits. The Shi Yousan's troops, who were incorporated, only number six to seven thousand. They are now being trained, and the organization will be reported to the Central Government for instructions. Because Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek has gone to Shanghai, I have not yet received a reply. Regarding provincial affairs, because I am from a military background, with limited talent and shallow knowledge, and unfamiliar with politics, I only know to work hard within my responsibilities. Therefore, instead of staying in the provincial capital, I often go to the countryside to take a look. Most people in Chinese society take the four words 'promotion and wealth' too seriously. Therefore, most officials now claim to be revolutionary, but their actions are exactly the opposite. The so-called revolution is nothing more than relieving the suffering of the people and seeking happiness for the people. Therefore, as long as officials do not act like merchants, always thinking of a short-term tenure, anything can be done. County magistrates, judges, and prosecutors are all so-called 'people-loving' officials, so their actions are especially important. Therefore, it is necessary to always see what they are doing. There are no bandits in Shandong Province, only scattered bandits on the border of Shandong and Henan, who gather at night and disperse in the morning, so there is no need to deploy troops to suppress them. Regarding the issue of opium prohibition, because of my personal nature, I don't know much about whether smoking is beneficial or harmful, but I see that smokers become weaker and weaker, so I oppose smoking. I have been with Mr. Feng Yuxiang for twenty years and have never left him. The reason for my previous departure was partly because Mr. Feng ordered the people to grow opium in Shaanxi and Gansu."</p>
<p>Wu Tiecheng, a member of the Central Committee, visited Mr. Han at around 11:00 AM on the 22nd and talked for about ten minutes. He received a phone call from the headquarters saying that Deputy Commander Zhang Xueliang would come to Han's residence to visit. Han thought that since he came to visit Zhang, it would be inappropriate for Zhang to come first. Han then led Fan Pujiang and Jiang Bocheng to the hospital to visit Zhang and report everything, talking for more than ten minutes. Then he visited Yu Xuezhong and Wan Fulin, exchanged pleasantries briefly, and returned to the reception to rest. In the afternoon, Zhang arrived at Han's residence in plain clothes and a straw hat, carrying a cane, accompanied by Zhang Xueming. He said to Han that he had heard that Han had inspected the troops on the way, which was extremely tiring. Han said that he took the opportunity to pay his respects to the Deputy Commander and inspected the troops on the way, so it was not worthy of praise. They talked for more than twenty minutes, and Zhang returned to the hospital. In the afternoon, Han Fuju visited Shang Zhen, Bao Yulin, Zhou Dawen, Zhang Xueming, Pang Bingxun, and others, talking briefly and then leaving. (23rd)</p>
<h3>Liu Zhenhua and Zhang Fang Pass Through Jinan: Liu Goes South, Zhang Goes North</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Liu Zhenhua, Pacification Commissioner of the Henan-Shaanxi-Shanxi Border Area, passed through Jinan by special train from Tianjin to Nanjing today (23rd). He arrived at Jinan Station at 9:40 AM. Liu was wearing a gray woolen gown and looked a little older than the last time he passed through Shandong. He was accompanied by a few staff members and a platoon of guards. After Liu got off the train, he shook hands with those who welcomed him and was invited to the first-class waiting room by Li Shuchun, Sun Tongxuan, and others to rest. According to Liu, his troops are currently stationed in the Huaiqing area and may be transferred to Xinxiang in the future. Liu casually talked with Sun, Li, and others. Liu said that the Henan militia has more than 5,000 rifles in each county, and even small counties such as Pingdeng, Ziyou, and Bo'ai have 10,000 rifles, totaling no less than 300,000 rifles in the province. Regarding the recent situation in western Henan, he can tell Chairman Han after he returns to Jinan. Now, Wang Naiwen in Lushi County is still recruiting bandits on a large scale. In fact, the more bandits are recruited, the more there are. If they are not recruited, there will naturally be no bandits. Therefore, there is now a nursery rhyme in western Henan: "If you want to be an official, first sit on a pole; if you want to sit in a sedan chair, first sit in a temple," which means that becoming a bandit can lead to promotion at any time, and everyone takes pride in being a bandit, which really has a significant impact on society. Liu finally asked about the opium prohibition situation in Shandong. Li Shuchun told him that it has been very effective. Those who sell drugs often commit suicide by disembowelment or hanging themselves because if they sell Japanese goods or are caught, they cannot explain to the Japanese. However, there are still those who sell them. In Linqu, someone actually planted more than 70 acres of opium in the mountains. When the county magistrate found out, he uprooted them, and the people actually went to the province to sue, saying that the county magistrate was oppressing the people. Later, the Department of Civil Affairs sent a telegram to commend the county magistrate for his meritorious service, and the people dared not sue anymore. Liu also talked about the prevalence of drugs in Henan, with all kinds of strange things. Some people can get addicted by rubbing a piece of white paper with their hands. Those who sell drugs must be shot. At 10:15 AM, Liu boarded the train and headed south. The welcoming staff also left the station separately.</p>
<p>Zhang Fang, Commander of the 20th Route Army and Director of the Henan Department of Civil Affairs, arrived in Jinan from Nanjing on Train No. 202 at 6:00 PM today (23rd). According to Zhang, his mission is to discuss the issues of clearing the countryside in Shandong and Henan and disaster relief for the floods in Henan with Chairman Han. Now that Chairman Han has gone to Beiping, he will immediately go to Beiping. The bandits in Henan have not been completely eliminated. Most of his troops are stationed in the Nanyang area. Because they are stationed too scattered along the railway line, they can only defend the areas where they are stationed. It is a little inconvenient to gather troops to suppress the bandits. When the plan for clearing the countryside is completed in the future, the bandits will no longer be a problem. After Zhang got off the train, he stayed at the Jiaoji Hotel and will go to Beiping in the next few days. (23rd)</p>
<h3>Shandong Yellow River Water Level Dropping, but Still Unpredictable Due to Wind and Rain</h3>
<p>Zhang Lianjia Is Still Supervising the Emergency Rescue</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Today, the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Yellow River continue to report water level drops. The water level at Luokou is 8 feet 9 inches and 2 fen above sea level, which is 3 feet 8 inches lower than the highest water level this year. The situation is generally stable, but the northeast wind is strong today, and it rained again in the afternoon, so it is still difficult to predict what will happen in the future. Zhang Lianjia, Director of the River Affairs Bureau, is still inspecting the Dongzhuang and Lisheng Village areas in the upper reaches, supervising the emergency rescue. The water level reports from the following locations are recorded below: (1) Upper Reaches: Zhang Lufu and Wang Huaiyi reported that the water level at Lisheng Village was normal at 6:00 PM last night, with a water level of 17 zhang 3 chi 4 cun. The water level at Sunlou dropped 4 cun at 6:00 PM tonight, with a water level of 14 zhang 3 chi. (2) Middle Reaches: Zhang Yunpei and Wang Kuiqing reported from Guanzhuang that the water level dropped 3 cun at 6:00 PM tonight, with a water level of 10 zhang 6 chi. Zhou Ruyi and Liu Yuhe reported from the Ji River that the water level dropped 5 cun at 6:00 AM on the 23rd, with a water level of 9 zhang 5 chi 6 cun. They also reported that the water level dropped 4 cun at 6:00 PM on the 22nd, with a water level of 9 zhang 6 chi 1 cun. Qi Zongshou and Chen Kuiyuan reported from Xiaoluzhuang in Luokou that the water level dropped 5 cun at 6:00 AM on the 23rd, with a water level of 8 zhang 9 chi 3 cun.

Wang Ziyuan, Director of the Public Security Bureau of Licheng County, reported today that the water level at Huojia Liuyu dropped a total of 3 chi 2 cun on the 21st, 22nd, and 23rd. (23rd)</p>
<h3>The Investigation Report on the Xuzhou Flood Shows the Need for Urgent Relief</h3>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: Since the Xuzhou area suffered a flood at the beginning of the month, a local flood relief association was formed to provide temporary relief and repeatedly telegraphed the provincial government to report the disaster, as well as sending representatives to the province to request relief. Recently, the provincial government sent Shen Tiecheng and Han Tongsheng to Xuzhou to investigate the disaster. According to the survey of the disaster area by the flood relief association, the main points are as follows: (1) Cause of the Disaster: Since the beginning of summer, there has been continuous rain, with particularly heavy rainfall from August 1st to 7th, with an average water depth of more than 2 chi in the whole county. In addition, the river channels in the whole county are silted up, the old Yellow River has flooded, and there are several breaches in Jizui Dam, Xiaobeimen, Hongfusi, Cangsheng Temple, and the Fire God Temple, which caused the disaster. (2) Loss Statistics: The total land area of Tongshan County is 3,600,000 mu, of which 2,160,000 mu were flooded, and 113,355 houses collapsed. (3) Affected Areas: The entire city and the 8th, 9th, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 6th, and 7th districts were most severely affected. In addition, the 4th, 10th, 11th, and 12th districts were less affected. The average water level was more than 1 chi 5 cun. (4) Number of Affected People: The total population of the county is 986,536, of which 493,268 were affected, including 328,846 adults and 164,422 children. 148 people were injured and 105 people died. (5) Estimated Urgent Relief Funds: Each adult needs 1 jiao per day, and each child needs 5 fen per day. The amount of funds depends on the length of the relief period. It is estimated that 287,731 yuan will be needed within a week. (6) Relief Methods: One is to open more temporary ditches to divert water into the river and dredge the lower reaches of the old Yellow River to facilitate drainage. The other is to rebuild the old Yellow River embankment and the old ditches in the city, add sluice gates, deepen the old river, and dredge the river channels throughout the county to prevent future disasters. The relief association's survey and statistics are as follows. The county government has also sent personnel to various districts to investigate the disaster situation. The relief association started to provide shelter from the 10th and ended on the 16th. At present, the water in the city has receded, but the collapsed houses are waiting to be repaired, and there is a lack of labor and materials. Those who have no houses to live in are living with relatives and friends, and there is also a shortage of food and fuel. During the shelter period, only 1,455 disaster victims were accommodated. There are still many people outside the city who have not been reached. The provincial government has approved the allocation of 3,000 yuan, and Wang Jun has telegraphed Zheng to Xuzhou to instruct the garrison to provide assistance of 1,000 yuan. Liu Zhi has telegraphed Xuzhou from Bianjing to remit 1,000 yuan. Local gentry and wealthy people have also made donations. Li Houji donated 2,000 yuan, Wu Jichang donated 500 yuan, and County Magistrate Yang donated 400 yuan. In addition, local personnel also initiated a disaster relief drama, with all expenses borne by the initiators, which can net 3,000 yuan. Other entertainment venues and entertainment groups have generously donated. However, after the major disaster in Xuzhou, they have all been affected, and there is still an urgent need for donations from other places to save the disaster victims. After Shen and Han finished their investigation, they went to investigate the seven counties. (24th)</p>
<h3>Large-Scale Bandit Suppression by Troops Stationed in Western Anhui</h3>
<p>Zha Bu Correspondence: The territory of Huoqiu and Lu'an in western Anhui is complex with mountains, so the Red bandits have been hiding in it, and they have not been completely eliminated so far. However, the various armies are still carrying out suppression. For example, the military authorities in the Yejiaji, Balitan, Baitaban, Wangjialoulou, Gujiadian, Hongjiaji, and Chongxingji areas in the southern part of Huoqiu, which have been reduced to Red areas, believe that the Song Shike unit of the temporarily compiled 2nd Brigade stationed in Huoqiu lacks training, so the county seat of Huoqiu has been in danger of being lost several times. Therefore, the independent brigade Zheng Tingzhen unit of the 32nd Division Liang Guanying was specially dispatched from Lu'an to Huoqiu to assist in the suppression of bandits. It is reported that the Zheng unit has recently joined forces with the local security regiment of Sun Gengshan and Yao, etc., and advanced from Huoqiu to the bandit area to search and suppress. They captured a lot along the way. When they attacked Danjiapu, the bandits were in a terrible state, but they still stubbornly resisted by the river. The local farmers took the initiative to join forces with the Red Band and White Tassel Spear Society to cross the river to assist in the attack.</p>
<p>The bandit forces were unable to resist and retreated one after another. The military and civilians took advantage of the victory to pursue and kill countless bandits. Yuan Jingfu, head of the Huoqiu Special Zone Joint Defense and Countryside Clearing Special Service Regiment, also led his team across the river to assist in the attack. In Lu'an, the Red bandits entrenched in the Donglianghekou area gathered more than a thousand people a week ago and crossed the river from Panjiawei to attack the Wangjiangwan anti-communist regiment. The leader of the regiment, Zhou Chengqing, led his team to fight head-on. After about an hour of fighting, they were unable to resist due to their weakness. They lured the bandits to the vicinity of Qingshan and urgently reported to the Wang and Liu brigade leaders of the 46th Division stationed in Subu for assistance. Wang and Liu rushed to help after receiving the report. The bandits were caught off guard and were defeated. They retreated to Lianghekou. The bandits were scrambling to cross the river to escape when the government army had already chased after them. They swept the bandit ships with machine guns, and many ships were hit and sunk. Many bandits drowned, so they were already in disarray. Moreover, the bandit leader Mao Zhengchu has been shot dead by the pseudo-division commander Xiao Fang, so the bandit army is on the verge of collapse. The Lu'an County Government believes that the Red bandits are spreading within the territory, and there are latent dangers everywhere. They have now issued special orders to the anti-communist regiments and security regiments in various towns, townships, and districts to strictly clear the countryside to eliminate the bandit scourge.

<h3>Wuhu Fast Mail</h3>
<p>The Wuhu County Education Fund has always relied heavily on surcharges on farmland. This year, the polder fields were almost completely flooded, and the education fund is on the verge of bankruptcy. Yesterday, County Education Director Yu and others convened a county-wide education administrative conference and decided that in addition to apportioning a small amount of the original education fund, they would also organize an education fund relief committee to raise funds. In terms of thrift, they will close schools with poor performance, merge classes, stop recruiting new students, and reduce administrative expenses.</p>
<p>The Wuhu Anti-Japanese Aid Overseas Chinese Committee recently held a meeting and resolved that the Wuhu rapeseed, which was originally sold to the Japanese, should be banned from export. The resale of Japanese goods to the mainland by various merchants is also strictly prohibited from export, and the industry workers are instructed not to transport them.</p>
<p>The water level here has risen more than five inches in the past few days. The Hankou branch of the Bank of China telegraphed the Wuhu branch, saying that there will be two feet of floodwater passing through Wuhu. Please pay attention to raising the warehouses. The water depth on Erjie Road and other places has reached more than four feet, and people cannot live in the houses. The number of displaced people is increasing day by day. All traffic can only be done by boats. The Public Security Bureau has opened boat registration and charges a handling fee of 5 jiao and 3 jiao. However, these people are all flood refugees and rickshaw pullers who have changed their professions and are extremely poor, so public opinion is against it.</p>
<p>Most of the industries in the Wuhu market have been suspended since the flood. The Public Security Bureau also has no way to collect the shop rent that it relies on to maintain itself. Bureau Director Zhao Jingshi invited the Chamber of Commerce and the banking industry to hold a meeting. As a result, they borrowed 10,000 yuan from the banking industry to meet the urgent need and will collect and repay it after the market recovers. (23rd)</p>

<h3>Students from Unregistered and Closed Schools Allowed to Transfer to Appropriate Grades</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education, based on the report from the Nanjing Municipal Education Bureau, stated that 13 private secondary schools requested that students from unregistered or closed schools be allowed to transfer to appropriate grades and be given academic status to encourage talent. The Ministry of Education instructed to check Article 17 of the Provisional Regulations for Secondary Schools, which stipulates that the entrance qualifications for junior high school are graduation from elementary school, and the entrance qualifications for senior high school are graduation from junior high school. If there are no two qualifications mentioned above, those with equivalent levels who pass the examination may also be admitted. Students from unregistered or closed schools who apply for admission may be admitted if they pass the examination and have equivalent levels. However, they must follow the Ministry's Order No. 854 of 1919, and the bureau will determine the proportion of students admitted to the total number of new students.</p>

<h3>Request to Change the Length of Medical Specialty Studies to Three Years</h3>
<p>The central government has decided to universally establish agricultural, medical, and engineering specialty schools in all provinces and cities, implementing plans for this as well as for establishing secondary agricultural and industrial schools. The duration of medical specialty studies was changed to four years. Subsequently, the Ministry of Education, based on recommendations from the Medical Education Committee, requested that the duration of pharmaceutical specialty school studies be limited to three years, plus one year of internship. The reasons are: (1) Given that medical schools are divided into two levels as a premise, the difference in duration between medical specialty schools and medical colleges should be at least two years; (2) Medical specialty schools aim to meet the urgent needs of the present, and reducing the duration of studies by one year would be more convenient for both the schools and the students. If the duration of studies for medical specialty schools is set at four years, the internship period should seemingly be included within that time. After the Ministry of Education submitted the situation to the Executive Yuan, it is rumored that approval will be granted.</p>

<h3>Covenant for Fellows of the Vocational Education Society to Use National Goods</h3>
<p>The Chinese Vocational Education Society, recognizing the dangers of economic aggression by the great powers, previously held a national vocational education discussion meeting in Zhenjiang. The meeting featured a proposal to adopt domestic goods, which was unanimously approved by the attending representatives. Recently, the staff of the society's office department have specially formulated five articles of covenant to ensure compliance. In addition to all staff members signing the covenant, it will also be circulated to all affiliated organizations, and it is planned to widely encourage all members within the country to implement it.

It says: Respected Sirs, the other day, the colleagues attended the vocational education discussion meeting in Zhenjiang, and the Zhenjiang organs set up a banquet to invite them to the Chamber of Commerce at that time, and the patriotic atmosphere permeated the whole hall. It was decided that all organs and staff members will uniformly use domestic goods in the future, and no matter how crude the domestic goods are, they should be used as much as possible. Our Vocational Education Society has already initiated it in the past, and should follow the principle of giving priority to righteousness. It will be implemented immediately, persistently and strictly, and from advocating the use of domestic goods, it will be transformed into using domestic goods and revitalizing domestic goods. This is not only fulfilling the duties of a single citizen, but also the rise and fall of the nation's future depends on it. The covenant is drafted as written on the left. If you agree, please sign your name.</p>
<p>Covenant of the Chinese Vocational Education Society</p>

(3) Fellows of the Society shall advocate that all items used by the Society should be domestic goods. If it is found that Japanese goods have been mistakenly purchased, the clerk should be informed to pay attention. Only if it is absolutely necessary to use foreign goods can a proposal be submitted to a meeting for decision. (4) Within the last year, the fellows of the Society may propose opinions on promoting domestic goods and revitalizing domestic goods at the office meeting held on the first Monday of each month for public discussion. (5) The effective period of this covenant shall be limited to one year for the time being, that is, from August of the 20th year of the Republic of China to July of the 21st year.

<h3>Women's Athletic Meet</h3>
<p>Low hurdle breaks world record ·· Twelve seconds</p>
<p>The United States is actively preparing for the world sports championship this year, so the U.S. National Women's Athletic Meet was held in New Jersey City on July 25. The results of each event were the highest peak in the world today. The most outstanding of these was the 80-meter low hurdle time of Ms. Tederigo Sun, which was only 12 seconds, breaking the world record of 12.2 seconds held by Czech Ms. Siguru. The 220-yard champion was won by Ms. Varasu, who represented Poland at the 3rd World Women's Games last year and won the first individual score (reported in this newspaper last year). The lady is indeed an American, and her representation of Poland last year was hired by the country. This matter was noticed by the conference committee last winter. When Ms. Varasu returned to the United States, she changed her name to Varasu. The results of the U.S. National Women's Athletic Meet are recorded below,</p>

<p>Diving Zhou Xuanguang (Jiao) Gong Yibin (Jiao) (Performance)</p>
<p>Total Score Fudan 18 points Jiaotong University 18 points</p>
<p>It is found that the swimming match is still the first of its kind in Shanghai. Peking Yanjing and Tsinghua held it once this year, and the results are still good. However, our country's swimming movement is extremely immature, and the results have not improved. The actions of the two schools can be said to be the forerunners of promotion.</p>
<h3>Fifth Ping Pong Champagne Cup</h3>
<p>Detailed Meeting Agenda for the Competition Starting on September 1</p>
<p>The Shanghai Race Club Members' Club 5th Ping Pong Champagne Cup, which has been rumored for a long time, has been scheduled to issue a mobilization order from September 1. The order forms for each group are already being arranged and will be released soon. The representatives' meeting convened by the cup competition staff meeting the night before (24th) was held as scheduled, and the rules decided are as follows: (1) The competition will use 02 China Lianhuan brand ping pong balls; (2) The competition will take the Far East Ping Pong Rules (3) A person named Lu Zhongqiu, during the finals of the previous Champagne Cup, tore up the coupons given by the staff meeting in accordance with the regulations because he did not get a hundred sheets of coupons. The crime of having no sports personality and sports morality, and even publicly insulting, is obvious, which is not a small shame to the ping pong world. The staff meeting proposed to discuss the issue of his qualification to join the cup competition. Later, a vote was taken with a majority in favor, resulting in a ratio of nine to six, and a majority opposed his participation in the cup competition, canceling his participation qualification. (4) If team A wants to postpone the match against team B, they can contact the other party directly. They must report to the staff meeting afterwards and make it up within two weeks. If the other party is unwilling to postpone, the arrangement will be based on the order form. (5) If team A cannot arrive on time due to important reasons, the other party may forgive it. If it is not approved, team A can report the details to the staff meeting, and the staff meeting will decide based on the circumstances. (6) The competition results must be submitted within two days at the latest. (7) The competition venue was recognized on the spot as follows:</p>

<h3>World Trivia</h3>
<p>— Sea Guest</p>
<p>An Unusually Large Bed</p>
<p>The most famous bed in England is the Great Bed of Ware, recently displayed in the Victoria and Albert Museum. This large bed was previously used for many years at the Crown Inn in Ware, Hertfordsbire, and was later moved to another hotel. It is indeed an antique.</p>
<p>In old English inns, it seems that large beds were commonly used, with many travelers sleeping on the same bed. For example, the White Hart Inn in Scole, Norfolk, had an unusually large bed that could accommodate as many as forty people. This can be considered an unprecedentedly large bed in bed history.</p>
<p>The origin of large beds is very simple. According to Bishop of Portsmouth, Bishopofportsmouth, his great-grandfather was an Irish gentleman who had a large bed in the billiard room of his residence that could comfortably sleep eight people. It was specially designed for guests, because after their dinner, they played billiards for pleasure. When they wanted to go back, the outside of the door was all swampy and it was inconvenient to travel at night, so they stayed on that big bed for one night. Later, hotels adopted this method and prepared large beds. But in the twentieth century, travelers preferred to stay in a room alone, and these large beds were abandoned.</p>
<h3>Eulogy for General Xuanwei</h3>
<p>— Tao Zaidong</p>
<p>General Xuanwei, the late Jiang Zun, courtesy name Boqi, passed away at the age of fifty on the eighth day of the eighth month of this year while residing in Shanghai. Alas! During the Xinhai Revolution, you were the second governor of Zhejiang Province. Your successor was Zhu Xingwu, for whom I served as the secretary of the Xingwu administrative office, so I knew much of your actions. In the fourth year of the Republic [1915], I was sent to the old capital on official business. At that time, you were a general in the General's Office, and we had a very pleasant conversation. When I was heading south, you hosted a farewell banquet. After the drinking, you and Zhu Baozan secretly confided in me, telling me that the Five-Route Memorial Case would inevitably lead to the establishment of an imperial system. You said, "I must leave Beijing and return to mobilize the people of Zhejiang to prepare for a response." Not long after, the Chuoan Society was indeed established, and you also drifted away into seclusion. In the sixth and seventh years of the Republic [1917-1918], I served as magistrate of Zhuji, your hometown. In my governance and reforms, I often received your assistance. Elder Guan Yun especially praised and supported me. When the supervisory order was issued to cut back veterans' pensions, I submitted a petition against it, arguing with the governor, and narrowly escaped censure because of your family connection. Later, police officer Si told me, "Qi Xi did not blame Shu Xiang for not apologizing because he was acting in the public interest." Between the thirteenth and fourteenth years of the Republic [1924-1925], when Qi Xie and Lu Yongxiang were at odds, Sun Xia governed Zhejiang. You were invited to Hangzhou to attend a welcome meeting. At that time, I was magistrate of Hangzhou. After the public banquet, we had a private meeting. Knowing the hardship of the chief magistrate in providing for everything, you suggested, "Why not seek a transfer?" I quoted Liu Zhiji, the historian, saying, "Being treated worse than a slave by Zhou Gong and Confucius," and said, "Today's county magistrates are like this. What choice is there in going to another county?" You were silent. The following year, I resigned and made a living as a writer in Shanghai. I met you at the funeral of Mr. Zhou. We sat together with Chen Jikan, Xu Guiqing, Yu Tieshan, and others from Zhuji. You repeatedly praised my integrity and ability, and there was an intention to encourage me to return to office. But you did not know that I was like a weary bird returning to the clouds, with no intention of leaving my secluded life. I have the illness of Tao Yuanming, so I am lazy. Even if relatives and friends come to visit, I do not return the visit, and often do not see them for years. But Xingru from my family, who has been traveling with you, tells me that you have been practicing Buddhism devoutly, and your household is serene. When you were seriously ill, your friend Li Wuning visited you three or four times a day. Each time, he would leave five hundred or even a thousand gold coins for medical expenses. On the day of your death, he added another thousand gold coins to buy a coffin and shroud. Otherwise, you would have had no means for burial due to your poverty. Therefore, everyone praises Wuning, and I especially admire that a man of integrity befriends another man of integrity. You were a pioneer in the revolution and a respected elder in the military. Father and son were both accomplished in civil and military affairs, and your name was highly respected in the southeast. Fifty is the age when the ancients took office. How could the concession be a place where we wished to end our days? Yet, you died of poverty and illness, which is heartbreaking. Reflecting on our lifelong friendship, I regret that I am old and my talent has faded, and I cannot write an inscription of gold and stone to commemorate you. While lamenting the deceased, I also reflect on myself. I have composed an elegiac poem to express my sorrow. The poem says: "The revolution has not yet succeeded, and you have died young. It makes heroes fill their sleeves with tears. As an official, I knew I was incompetent, but you wrongly praised my integrity and ability. How can I compare to Marquis Fuqianqu?"</p>
<h3>Life is Twenty-One Years</h3>
<p>— Wang Yanjin</p>
<p>According to the statistics of the world's human age table, the age of ordinary people is approximately from fifty to seventy years old. Averaging this out, we can assume it to be sixty years old. Now, let's subtract the time spent on meals, sleep, and rest to calculate the actual time for work.</p>
<p>1.  Education time: 15 years. 2. Rest time: 7.5 years. (Assuming 50 rest days per year, and 10 days for illness.) 3. Meal time: 4 years and 8 months. (Calculating 3 hours per day). 4. Sleep time: 10 years and 11 months. (Sleeping at 10 pm and waking up at 5 am.) 5. Post-meal rest time: 18 months. (Resting for 10 minutes after each meal.)</p>
<p>Excluding the above five items, what remains is the time for work in life. Calculating carefully, it does not even amount to twenty-one years and one month. Compatriots, the time in life is so short, and our mission is so heavy. We cannot allow for even a moment of negligence, laziness, or procrastination. Let's all work hard! I hope that friends and families will cut out this table and use it as our motto.</p>
<h3>A Record of Watching Quail Fights</h3>
<p>— Jian Fu</p>
<p>In a Yuan palace poem by Zhu Youdun of the Song Dynasty, it says, "When the Mid-Autumn Festival approaches, we cut velvet flowers and incite quail fights." The custom of quail fighting has been around for a long time and did not originate today. However, in ancient times, this was done as a game, while now it is done for gambling. That is the difference. The trend of quail fighting is prevalent in Jiangbei, with Hao County being the most prominent. A good quail can be worth over a hundred taels of gold, and the stakes for betting can amount to tens of thousands. Many middle-class families go bankrupt because of this. It is even more extravagant than the cricket fights of the wealthy. Last autumn, I stayed in Hao County, during the time of quail fighting. Due to the strict prohibition by the authorities, it was not possible to openly set up arenas for gambling; instead, it was done in private residences. Before the fight, the quail's physique is first examined, and then the betting value is discussed to ensure fairness. Quail breeders often keep the quail in brocade pouches, with an oval-shaped wooden ring at the bottom to prevent the quail from being crushed. Quail born in early spring are called "Bai Bi," while those born after autumn are called "Zao Tu." Zao Tu have the most venomous beaks, which Bai Bi cannot withstand. Therefore, those who raise Bai Bi are often unwilling to have them fight Zao Tu. Such is the reason. The fighting method involves placing a large bamboo basket on the ground and putting the quail inside from the pouch. Grain is then scattered in the basket. When the quail see the grain, they fight over it. During the fight, they each raise their wings, making a "woo-woo" sound. The duration of the fight can be several minutes or even tens of minutes. If they are evenly matched, it can last for quite some time. Exhausted, they each rest for a while, glaring at each other like angry frogs. After a while, one of them looks down, wanting to peck at the grain. The other suddenly pounces forward. Then the fierce fighting resumes. After this final battle, the victory and defeat are determined, and the betting stakes are also judged. At this time, the winning quail grabs the food, and the winning person grabs the money, obtaining what is called the spoils of war. Their joy knows no bounds. The losing quail jumps out of the basket, not daring to re-enter, and the losing person feels sorry for the loss of money, filled with shame and anger, looking quite disheveled. The transformations of people and things at this point are truly a sight to behold. The reporter is deeply moved by gambling with quail fights. The quail are pure. When they are in the wild, they call out to each other when they find food and gather together when they hear the sound. They lie together during the day and fly together at night, without any sense of gain or loss. What is the meaning of fighting? But after being raised by humans, they fight each other when they see food and become hostile when they hear sounds. They treat the pouch as their territory and the bamboo basket as their battlefield. Because of the fight over millet today, they forget the righteousness of being in the wild. How superficial they are! The change in the nature of things is so rapid, which is also strange.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes from the North Station</h3>
<p>— Lanxi</p>
<p>Having read the "Anecdotes from the North Station" by Qi Jun published in yesterday's newspaper, all the sections are true. However, there are still matters that are both important and crucial that were not mentioned. I am supplementing them here.</p>
<p>This flood has affected sixteen provinces, a rare catastrophe unseen in a hundred years. It is indeed a harsh punishment from heaven to the people. We, who reside in Shanghai, enjoy gentle breezes and warm sunshine, with calm waves. Compared to the refugees who are bearing the brunt of the disaster, who lack food, clothing, and shelter, it is no less than heaven and hell. However, everyone has a heart of compassion. After reading the reports of the devastation, can we not feel a surge of sympathy? Therefore, the two Railway Bureau directors, Mr. Guo, initiated a fundraising campaign for the national flood disaster on both railways and jointly formulated fundraising measures with key members of the two railways. All railway staff with salaries below fifty yuan are to donate fifteen percent; those below one hundred yuan, twenty percent; and those above one hundred yuan, twenty-five percent. If railway staff have any other suggestions, they can submit them within three days. When it comes to benevolence, people with good intentions all have the same heart. The severity of the flood is fiercer than poisonous snakes and fierce tigers. Those who have not been affected can imagine it. How can those who are well-fed and living comfortably bear to hear countless suffering compatriots crying out for food without showing compassion? The staff of the two railways, calculated according to these figures, can collect more than eighty thousand yuan. However, it is still like a drop in the bucket. It is hoped that all Shanghai residents will fulfill their sense of self-love and self-interest, and donate according to their abilities. Then, a little effort can accumulate into a great achievement, and the disaster victims will receive boundless blessings.</p>
<p>Short News. The Weiya Restaurant, in light of the severe floods affecting various provinces this year, a rare occurrence in nearly a century, the entire staff of the main store and its branches, both labor and management, will make a charitable effort today. All proceeds from business, plus small tips and rewards, will be transferred to the Flood Relief Association to aid disaster relief. Although it is like a drop in the bucket, many large stores are full of benevolent people, fulfilling the natural duty of humanity. Continuing charitable efforts may well accumulate into a great achievement. (Initial)</p>
<h3>Travels in India (91)</h3>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>January 1, 20th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1931]. Staying at the residence of lawyer Mu Keji in Sllahabadu, Allahabad City. In the morning, I rode a bicycle to tour the woods. The air in the north of the city is fresh and the roads are wide, shaded by large trees, far superior to other cities. To the east is the sacred water of the Ganges River, where for thousands of years, seven women have been baptized to repent for their sins. It is the Jordan River of India. Today, I went to the home of a wealthy old woman with lawyer Mu. She was extremely rich but very stingy, and deeply religious. She bowed at every temple along the way, but would not easily give a penny to the rickshaw puller, making one think of the uselessness of superstition. Traveling east for about five miles, near the train tracks, there are rows of large trees with pale bark, called Asutar. This tree occupies a great position in India, and those who worship it are numerous, with the same need as worshiping cows. It is also called the "Mother Tree," being the wife of a certain tree. No Indian dares to harm the Mother Tree. The male tree can be used for medicine and has a wide range of uses. People use it but forget to love it. However, the Mother Tree has no use, but Indians worship and protect it. Whoever dares to harm the Mother Tree will be surrounded by a crowd and fought to the death. It is like someone daring to kill a cow in an Indian religious city, then the Indians will gather and kill that person, as if protecting their mother. I asked its scholars and university professors about the principles of protecting cows, and they all replied, "Our entire family has grown up eating milk since childhood. Having eaten its milk, to eat its meat would be without heavenly principles and conscience, which Indians do not do." I was deeply touched by their words. How India knows to repay kindness! Observing the worship of Mother Trees and Mother Cows in India, I realized the origin of the Buddhist scriptures on repaying kindness. This good thought of repaying kindness has already planted good roots in East Asia and will surely spread throughout the globe in the future. Only then can we hope for peace. India is a nation of maternal religion and maternal culture.</p>
<p>Around noon, I saw that each temple, large and small, had an object placed in the middle of the hall. The large ones were like millstones, and the small ones were like plates or cups. The largest were seven or eight feet tall, standing like cones, about a foot thick. Their shape was like a stick. No temple was without this object, and they were all made of stone. Some temples had multiple types. I had long been suspicious of this. Why did they resemble the sexual organs of men and women in coitus? I had long heard that Rome had the custom of worshiping the male genitalia. Master Wanhui said that India had the custom of worshiping reproductive organs. Could this be the object? However, in the cities, it was difficult to observe the temples because there were many people and the rooms were dark, making it difficult to distinguish. After visiting the countryside, I realized that they were everywhere under the clear blue sky. I began to understand that Indian religion is the religion of worshiping the sexual intercourse of men and women. This is generally true throughout India, but the sects are largely the same with minor differences. But its form is so obvious and clear. I asked the Indians what this object was. The Indians said, "Mahadeva," meaning the great god or great heaven. The name "Great Heaven" is seen in Buddhist scriptures. Men and women named "Great Heaven" are everywhere. They believe that this is the root of all gods, and all gods have spouses, being the source of life for humans and all things and the natural world. This source comes from the great god, so it must be worshiped, meaning heaven and earth, father and mother. However, for thousands of years, philosophers have added profound and mysterious explanations to it, making the learning so incomprehensible and eternally impossible to understand. Like the Chinese Xiantian Taoism, it also talks about the origins of human reproduction and all things in the world. Confucianism's Book of Changes talks about yin and yang, Taiji, and the eight trigrams, where father and mother, men and women, give birth to each other. There is nothing strange about this. However, I find it quite strange that Indians worship the naked sexual organs of men and women.</p>
<h3>Random Notes from the Northeast Inspection (2)</h3>
<p>— Liu Sui Jiu</p>
<p>There are three villages with separate residences for professors: (1) Dongxin Village, (2) Xixin Village, and (3) Nanxin Village. Each village has dozens of residences. The houses are equipped with steam heating pipes, hot and cold water pipes, and porcelain toilets and bathtubs. Each house is estimated to be worth about ten thousand yuan. There is also a radio station, a sports field worth three hundred thousand yuan, a foundry, and a weaving factory. There is also a science museum worth two hundred and forty thousand yuan and a large library with construction costs estimated at three hundred thousand yuan. The entire school currently holds approximately over 70,000 books, valued at over 1.28 million yuan. The College of Science and Engineering currently has six to seven thousand kinds of machinery and chemicals, over 16,000 pieces of equipment, and 530 working machines in the factory, along with tens of thousands of tools. There are currently over 200 faculty and staff members and over 2,000 male and female students. The school's annual budget has increased from 439,000 yuan to over 1.3 million yuan. The scale is rare in the country.</p>
<p>(3) The Magnificence of Beiling</p>
<p>To the north of Northeast University is Beiling, the mausoleum of the former Qing Emperor Taizong. The architecture is magnificent, similar to Beiping Park. There are large pine forests to the east and west. Sitting and sipping tea, one feels transported to another world. Every day, Chinese and foreign tourists are endless. However, most tourists only see it as a scenic spot or a park. I am particularly interested in the love affair between Taizong's Empress Wen and Hong Chengchou, which people still enjoy discussing to this day. When I first arrived in Shenyang, I stayed at the YMCA at Dananmen, which was the place where Hong Chengchou was imprisoned at that time. A woman with great strategies, Taizong relied on her internal assistance to win the world. This is rare in ancient and modern history.</p>
<p>Taizong's mausoleum is called "Zhaoling." Beiling is a popular name. The Japanese have specialized in the study of its architecture and have written "Illustrated Explanation of Zhaoling in Fengtian," which is a total of 149 pages. On November 2nd last year, the Fengtian Library established by the Japanese held an exhibition. I was invited by the library director, Mr. Eto Toshio, to visit. I saw rubbings of the Tablet of Divine Merit and Sacred Virtue of Emperor Wen of Taizong in Zhaoling, and rubbings of the Tablet of Divine Merit and Sacred Virtue of Emperor Gao of Taizu in "Fuling" (i.e., Dongling). The inscriptions are in Chinese, Manchu, and Mongolian. I have visited various places to find these rubbings but have not been able to see them. Unexpectedly, I saw them in a Japanese library, which is fortunate. I also saw displayed in the library German-published photographic reproductions of such Manchu and Mongolian inscriptions, as well as various reduced versions of the tablets of Lama temples (such as the large tablet in four languages of Chinese, Manchu, Mongolian, and Tibetan in the Yonghe Temple in Beiping). They were very exquisite, and I was surprised by the precision of foreigners' research on our country's history. Therefore, when we visit Zhaoling, how can we merely stop at visiting a park and sipping tea?</p>
<p>It is said that Emperor Wen of Taizong of the Qing Dynasty was named Huang Taiji, the eighth son of Emperor Gao of Taizu, Nurhaci, and the brother of Prince Regent Dorgon. He died at the age of fifty-two, after reigning for seventeen years. After his death, his ninth son, Shunzhi, succeeded to the throne. His mausoleum is about ten miles from the city. The terrain is excellent. The Liao River curves to the right, and the Hun River wraps around to the left. Mountains are built with earth. The towers and battlements are towering, and the palaces are magnificent, comparable to palaces. In front of the Long'en Gate is the largest blue square brick, called "Danchi." It is said that officials of the nine Qing departments all sat here in order of rank. There is a line in Du Fu's poem "Facing the Danchi alone, the sun has not yet set," referring to this. Inside the Long'en Hall are the spirit tablets of Taizong and Empress Wen. The carved beams and painted rafters in the hall are exceptionally exquisite. In front of the main door of the hall is a piece of long, smooth green stone, about seven or eight feet long and three or four feet wide. The colors are brilliant and dazzling, truly a rare item. The steps connecting to the green stone in front have three white gemstone steps, with a smooth and lustrous stone quality and radiating precious light. To the west of the white gemstones is a piece of lapis lazuli in a rectangular form. Qing officials of the fourth rank used this kind of gemstone as the lapis lazuli top bead.</p>

<h3>Financial Gold Market Initially Weak, Ultimately Strong</h3>
<p>Several Changes...Rising Again by Eight Taels</p>
<p>The turmoil was not small. Yesterday, the 25th, the gold market was initially weak and then strengthened, with quite intense changes. There was a total fluctuation of sixteen taels in the early and late markets, with surging turmoil. As a result, it rose again by eight taels, and people's hearts went from virtual to high. Fellow traders sought supplies in different directions. The silver market rose, opening lower. Major players' selling momentum was excited. With both domestic and foreign exchange rates easing, the decline intensified, finally reaching 762-763 taels. Afterwards, exchange rates suddenly turned positive, and banks' buying intentions were not negligent, with same-day settlements. Good land partners and speculators competed to buy, rapidly turning upstream and surging by ten taels, breaking through the seventy tael mark. The late market felt even more promising, with buyers exceeding constant levels. Exchange rates changed again, continuing sharply, rising by four taels. The international economic situation was extremely difficult, making it difficult to relax the pound rate, and the gold price was also difficult to fall. There were many views of decline.</p>
<p>Slight Early Dip. The market opened slightly lower in the early morning of October by one tael and three qian, at 767.5 taels. The big bars were indeed longer by eight fen, the one-month forward was longer by sixteen fen and three li, the Zou price was increased by one-half, the private telegram was longer by sixteen fen and seven li, and the US stock market declined slightly. Inside the market, various firms such as Fuxing, Yongri, Changwanxing, Daxing, Yongqianchang, Xiangfuyu, Zhifengyong, etc., all sold, especially with British gold initially at 13 and then weakening. Shanghai Mitsui, etc., bought at 13.0625, so the continued decline was more than three taels. The British gold price was announced at 64 taels, with a listed price of 25 US dollars and 5 jiao, and the Japanese gold price dropped by three fen, so it fell to 62 taels. After that, Fuchang, Yifeng, Yongyuan, Hengyuan, Yuancheng, Yongyuanmao, Yonghengxing, Yuanda, Xingyong, Cuichangyong, etc., successively followed, mainly because Maijia Li absorbed 12.9375 British gold, so people's hearts turned upwards. Mr. Wu also dragged in, and the gold price happily rose, totaling more than ten taels. However, there were interjections of one or two taels, until 11:30, it was 73 taels and 7 qian. Yongheng, etc., sold out, and immediately lost more than one tael, becoming two or three qian. But the buyer was still active, and Mitsui, etc., absorbed British gold at 12.825, and the Indian exchange rate was also reported as slightly 4 anna. At noon, it reached 75 taels, 1 qian and 2 li, with retail customers slightly exiting, so the closing price was 73 taels and 9 qian, and then made to 4 taels and 5 or 6 qian. The announced price was changed to 797 taels and 4 qian, with a credit of 34-35 taels. The afternoon closing was 23 taels.</p>
<p>Thriving Aftermarket. The market opened at 75 taels, then 3 taels and 8 qian, and suddenly rose upwards. The Indian exchange rate was reported at slightly 23 anna, and Tian Hengxingyuan, Yuanmao, Yongfuyu, etc., bought in, so it rose by three or four taels.

It had already risen to 77 taels and 8 qian.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Yarn Markets Comparatively Stable</h3>
<p>This Month Down Only 1.5 to 2 Tael</p>
<p>The yarn market is slightly firm due to the consistent upward trend of overseas cotton yarn. Raw cotton prices are rising sharply due to weather conditions, leading to a rise in yarn prices. However, current yarn sales are relatively flat, and major players have already covered their short positions for this month, so apart from a unique drop of 1.5 to 2 tael, the far months are up 8 to 9 candareens.  However, both long and short positions are holding steady.</p>

<h3>Cotton Market Rebound Force Strong</h3>
<p>Foreign Cotton Weather... Two Major Reasons</p>
<p>The cotton market rose sharply, with the rebound force becoming stronger. The overseas cotton market turned upward, and the local weather was bad, with heavy wind and rain severely affecting cotton fields. As a result, short sellers panicked again, and there were also new purchases going long, leading to a sharp rise. However, major players and manufacturers with short positions remained unmoved and did not cover their positions at all. Some are still selling, because the world cotton market is still in surplus and not very frightening. However, the weather is very important, and there is currently a strong upward trend.</p>
<p>"Han Biao" Rises Sharply by 8-9 Candareens: The "Han Biao" market opened in the morning. The upward trend of foreign cotton was strong, with each month rising by 3 or 4 candareens.

<h3>Rice Prices Rise Sharply by One Yuan</h3>
<p>Due to the storm and rain yesterday, no boats could reach the South Market, and the inventory in the port was weak. In the morning, the number of people visiting the market was still quite large, and the route out of this street was more active than the previous market. Prices of various goods rose sharply, and people were panicked. Thin rice and thick japonica rice both rose by about one yuan. Although there was little early rice on the market, the situation also increased by 6 or 7 jiao. Superior grade rice was scarce, and customers continued to buy nearly 1,000 shi. The opening prices were all up by 4 or 5 jiao. New japonica rice and rice affected by weather were scarce.</p>
<p>Sources for Xinzha West Road were scarce, and city and rural transactions were not active. According to letters from Wuxi, the market for brown rice is increasing. According to this situation, prices of japonica and early and late indica rice rose by 5 or 6 jiao. Top-grade, reed-tip, port-tip, new japonica, and glutinous rice all rose by 4 or 5 jiao. The inventory of foreign rice was weak, and foreign firms continued to buy, and the opening price rose sharply by 3 jiao. River factories opened about 6,200 to 6,300 dan of various goods.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Prices Rise Sharply</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market situation: Although transactions were not very active, the market was quite good. Warehouses on this street had a good appetite. Because Shanghai has been hit by storms and rain, the price of white rice from downstream areas has skyrocketed, with the northern market rising by one yuan and the southern market rising by 6 or 7 jiao. Therefore, they were very active in buying foreign rice, and the price suddenly rose sharply. 1,000 bags of No. 2 Saigon were offered at 13.5 yuan, and 300 bags of small-grain rice were offered at 12.95 yuan. In addition, 170 bags of Jiangxi machine rice were offered at 14.8 yuan, all bought by warehouses on this street. A telegram for foreign rice was approved to ship several hundred tons of small-grain rice immediately at a price of 6 taels and 8.5 qian.</p>
<h3>Storm Creates Rise in Flour Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market: After the opening of the market in the morning, the prices of each month were generally hovering. Foreign wheat quotations had fallen slightly by 3 or 4 jiao, causing the market to be very quiet and transactions were few. Until the afternoon opening, sentiment was excited and prices rose sharply. Due to the sudden storm and heavy rain, and the predictions that Shanghai will also have a flood, the buying interest for near months was strong. The quantity of traders vying to buy from domestic gangs was extremely large. The buying interest for September, October, and November was the strongest, and the price increases were also drastic. This kind of price increase was purely caused by the storm. If the rain stops and the weather clears, sentiment should return to normal. As a result, the current month rose by 1.5 cents compared to the previous day, September rose by 2.25 cents, October rose by 3 cents, November rose by 2.75 cents, December rose by 3.25 cents, and February rose by 2.5 cents.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market Turns Firm in Afternoon, Near Months Uniquely Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market: After the opening of the market in the morning, the quotations for foreign wheat for each month were still not good, and the market was still flat. Until the afternoon opening, sentiment became excited due to the storm and rain. Domestic gangs successively purchased far-term months, and the market turned firm. Due to the settlement relationship of the current month, and because those preparing for delivery on the short side were between one and two hundred vehicles, and factories were not active, it was forcibly suppressed, and it felt slightly lower than the previous day. As a result, the current month fell by 1 cent compared to the previous day, and September to December each rose by 5 cents, and January rose by 3 cents. The spot wheat market turned quiet, and factories only responded. A total of over 1,000 bags of Kunshan and Pukou wheat were opened in the city, and the price did not fluctuate.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Japanese Merchants Replenish Stocks at Low Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market in Shanghai foreign firms still showed no improvement. Factory operations in New York are still at a standstill. Yesterday morning's silk report from Lyon, England, also showed no turn to Shanghai. Only Japanese firms replenished factory supplies at low prices, but the asking prices were not high, and factories' willingness to sell remained weak. Yesterday, only Mitsui bought 30 bales of medium Shanghai white from a factory, and Kechang bought 20 bales of yellow coarse silk. Prices remained firm.</p>
<h3>50 Pieces of New Silk Factory Cargo Arrived in Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Various silk factories in Hangzhou are bearing the foreign banks' monthly contract silk sales. Currently, because of the approach of the contract settlement, they are delivering the spot silk to Shanghai. Yesterday, 50 pieces of new factory silk from Wei Cheng and other factories were transported from Hangzhou by the Shanghai-Hangzhou train to prepare for settlement at the end of the month.</p>
<h3>Autumn Cocoon Feeding Volume in Linping Not Weak</h3>
<p>Smooth Incubation...Good Collection of Ants</p>
<p>Farmers in the Linping area have suffered losses in both spring and summer cocoons this year, and their willingness to raise autumn cocoons is quite strong. They pre-purchased a large number of improved varieties and started hatching. The weather was clear and pleasant, and the incubation was smooth, and the collection of ants was good. The feeding volume increased by about 30% compared to the summer cocoons.</p>
<h3>Gongxi Green Tea Sales to Europe Turn Smooth</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai foreign tea market saw slightly sluggish transactions of Zhenmei green tea from Wuyuan, Tunxi, and other areas. Except for the tip-picking category, which was still selling well to France, the rest were deserted. However, the Gongxi category saw some interest from British firms Jinlong, Baochang, Xiehe, Fushi, and others, as well as the China Tea Company. The Russian Aid Association also had some sporadic demand, and transactions were not quiet. The market price was unchanged from before. The market conditions for other items such as Zhenmei and Xiumei were slightly sluggish.</p>
<h3>New Autumn Woolen Cloth Sales Activated for Piece Goods</h3>
<p>As the new autumn season arrives and the weather gradually turns clear, the sales of woolen goods continue, and the market is gradually activating. In addition to the Hankou and Nanhua gangs, other Shanghai firms are also purchasing. Commonly used blue-grey plain serge, Huate woolen cloth, Huate woolen cloth in various mixed colors, Yuanzhigong, as well as Sea Tiger, Leopard Skin, Qiang, shoe felt cloth, and Maildeng thick woolen cloth all had transactions, and the original numbers of scattered pieces were opened for sale every day, and their sales were quite active.</p>
<h3>Hardware Transactions Increasingly Quiet in Storm</h3>
<p>Since the autumn, the sluggish sales and scarce practical applications of hardware have been rare in previous years. However, due to the impact of floods in various places, or the disturbances of soldiers and bandits, the period when autumn sales were activated in previous years saw a steady stream of purchasers, but this year there are very few. Because of this, the market is in a state of panic, and although standard grades are being maintained with great effort, the quiet business means that there is an appearance of strength but inner weakness. Furthermore, yesterday's storm and heavy rain caused fewer people to come to the market, so the goods opened for sale were even scarcer. It is estimated that over 200 dan of 7.5% British steel plates were sold yesterday at a price of 6 taels and 3.5 qian. 300-400 dan of No. 16 to No. 20 new lead wire were estimated at 13 taels and 2.5 qian. Various customer gangs were very diligent in purchasing No. 14 colored goods, and the market price was 12 taels and 2.5 qian. There were only sporadic transactions of American galvanized iron and black iron sheets. Although the Northern gangs were still inquiring about garden lead wire, the number of transactions was still scarce. In addition, although there were slightly more iron products opened for sale yesterday, the market did not fluctuate much.</p>

<h3>This Port's Yesterday's Hurricane, Rainstorm, and High Tide</h3>
<p>Roads Flooded, Ships Suspended</p>
<p>Since the hurricane first arrived the night before last, the roaring wind had subsided, and the intense heat had eased, much to the relief of the city's residents. Yesterday morning, however, thick clouds gathered, and the hurricane continued to blow, though without rain. By noon, sudden showers came, and the sound of wind and rain grew increasingly intense. In the Huangpu River, a high tide surged. By evening, all the roads had flooded, creating a very serious situation. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Yesterday Evening's Observatory Warning</p>
<p>At 9:00 PM last night, the Xujiahui Observatory issued a special warning, stating that the hurricane had clearly struck the coast near the Zhoushan Islands and was passing through Hangzhou Bay, continuing northwest. Shanghai would experience extremely strong winds and heavy rain, coming from the northeast to the southeast, with the hurricane moving towards the western part of Shanghai.</p>
<p>City Scene Desolate</p>
<p>Amidst the heavy wind and rain, the scene on the city's roads changed dramatically. Low-lying areas were flooded ankle-deep, some even a foot deep. The bitter wind and dreary rain created a desolate atmosphere. All the shops closed early, and by evening, there were very few pedestrians on the roads. Of the various modes of transportation, only cars could still pass. Trams were brought in early and could not carry passengers. Rickshaws, unable to withstand the strong wind and rain, mostly ceased operating, causing significant difficulties for city traffic.</p>
<p>Lights Extinguished Several Times</p>
<p>The lights in the Nanshi and Zhabei areas were extinguished several times due to power lines being broken by the wind and damaged transformers. Although workers were dispatched for repairs, restoration was difficult in the short term. As a result, many streetlights were out by evening. In the Zhabei area, the lights went off and on about three times from 5:00 PM onwards. In the Nanshi area, such as the Nine Acres area, all the lights were out from 10:00 PM onwards. A considerable number of shop signs and window shutters were blown down by the wind onto the roads. In the French Concession, the lights were also extinguished in the evening.</p>
<p>Strong Winds Blow Down Houses</p>
<p>Several houses were blown down by the strong wind and heavy rain. In Zhabei, the chimney of the Zhengtai Dyeing Factory on Minde Road was blown down around 5:00 PM, and the falling bricks injured the owner of the adjacent tofu shop. In Xinminde Xinli, one house was blown down. Around 3:30 PM, near Baker Road and Chengdu Road, several houses were also blown down. There were also several cases of fires caused by broken power lines.</p>
<p>High Tide in the Huangpu River</p>
<p>From 3:00 PM, the wind gradually increased, followed by heavy rain. The tide in the Huangpu River suddenly rose by about two feet. Ferries and sampans all stopped and sought shelter. The white waves were terrifying. It was reported that a barge was wrecked near the Bund Copper Statue Wharf. Many trees on the Bund were broken and felled by the wind. By 11:00 PM, the water level along the Bund had reached waist-deep due to the influx of river water.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Road Flooding</p>
<p>Roads in lower-lying areas were completely flooded, becoming a "country of lakes" as there was no way to drain the excess water. In the International Settlement, Fuzhou Road, Henan Road, Race Course, Chengdu Road, Carter Road, and in the French Concession, Route SayZoong and low-lying areas of Nanshi and Zhabei were flooded ankle-deep. Pedestrians had to lift their skirts and hold up their clothes to walk. Many motorcycles broke down on the road and were unable to move forward.</p>
<p>Drowning in Water Leads to Electrocution</p>
<p>Fu Baiqing, who lived at No. 262 Fuzhou Road, was playing in the water in front of his neighbor's house at No. 278 during the heavy wind and rain last night. Unaware that a broken power line was lying in the water, Fu accidentally stepped on it and was immediately electrocuted to the ground, unconscious. He was taken to Renji Hospital for treatment by the Lao Zha public concession police car, but it was too late. He died and was sent to the mortuary for an autopsy.</p>
<p>Overview of Roads This Morning</p>
<p>Due to the gradual rise of the tide in the Huangpu River, our reporter traveled by car to various locations at 1:00 AM this morning to conduct on-site investigations. The wind and rain made driving difficult. Abandoned cars were everywhere. The tide in the Huangpu River was rising westward. When the reporter was writing this report, the tide had already spread to Stone Road and was threatening to reach the Race Course. The Suzhou Creek also overflowed its banks. The ships anchored in the river to take shelter from the wind were densely packed, with their hulls as high as the houses on the shore. Nanjing Road, which is usually paved with wood, absorbed water and expanded, causing it to bulge upwards. Countless pieces of wood floated on the surface. The road surface was damaged in many places. When the wind stops and the water recedes in the future, the losses will be immeasurable. The Sixteen Puli and Gaochang Temple areas of Nanshi were completely flooded. All the lights were out, and the car traveled through a world of darkness. Even the police officers on duty had temporarily taken shelter. The walls of the residence of Dr. Ding Yuqin, a female doctor on Xunchidao Street, near the Great East Gate, collapsed, exposing the beds, tables, and furnishings inside. Many of the advertising billboards erected by the Public Works Department on various roads were blown down by the wind.</p>
<p>House Collapses This Morning, Injuring People</p>
<p>Around 1:00 AM this morning, the house of Wang Yongxing Laundry at No. 191 Henan Road, near Baoshan Road, collapsed in the strong wind. Four people inside the house were crushed to death because they were unable to escape in time. Three others were seriously injured. They were taken to Tongren Hospital for treatment by a fire engine. Their condition is quite dangerous.</p>
<p>Foreign Ships Sheltering from the Wind</p>
<p>This hurricane was even more severe than the last one. Yesterday afternoon, as the wind approached Shanghai and there were showers, foreign ships, which usually do not delay their schedules, had to anchor and stop en route. The Pacific Mail Steamer President Madison, of the Great Lai Yang Company, which came to Shanghai from Hong Kong via Luzon Island and was due to arrive in Shanghai yesterday morning, encountered the hurricane at Sanjiaoshui. For safety, the ship's owner had it anchored at sea. The Japanese Mail Company's San Francisco mail ship Ryuta Maru also sent a telegram to Shanghai yesterday, saying that it had sailed to Hirado Island to take shelter from the wind and would postpone its arrival in Shanghai. The Sino-American cargo ships Coolbaugh, and Kersaint, etc., were originally scheduled to enter the port today, but are now sheltering from the wind in the Yellow Sea and cannot sail here.</p>
<p>Sino-Japanese Liner Service Suspended</p>
<p>The Sino-Japanese liners scheduled to depart yesterday included the Nippon Yusen Kaisha's Shanghai Maru to Yokohama, the Rokko Maru to Osaka-Kobe, the Mikasa Maru, which goes to Kobe first and then to New York, and the Seimo Maru, among others, totaling six or seven ships. The cargo was fully loaded and the passengers boarded, but due to the continuing hurricane and the huge waves in the Yellow Sea, which made navigation very difficult, the ships did not dare to venture out and announced a postponement of their departure.</p>
<p>Coastal Vessels All Stopped</p>
<p>Having learned from the previous accidents involving the Weisheng, Guang Sheng, and Yichang, all coastal vessels refrained from sailing. The Swire Southern Ocean liner Suiyang remained in Wusong. The Northern Ocean ship Shuntian, the Niuzhuang ship Chongqing, and the Jardine Southern Ocean ship Zesheng, the Nisshin's Shanghai Maru, Huashan Maru, etc., all remained in Shanghai. The Xinjiang and Chongqing, which were already prepared for departure, sailed to Yangshupu, but due to the excessive wind, they all anchored and waited.</p>
<p>Yangtze River Vessels Remain Suspended</p>
<p>The strong wind has gradually approached Shanghai and reached the Hangzhou Bay area. There is also a hurricane in the Yangtze River Estuary. Therefore, all Yangtze River vessels did not depart on the 24th. Yesterday, the six companies' Yangtze River vessels that should have left Shanghai, including the Wuhu, Nanyang Maru, and Gonghe, had their cargo loaded, but because the wind was even stronger than the previous day, they were ordered to stay in Shanghai and not depart, waiting for the wind to stop tomorrow before traveling upstream with the previous day's Yangtze River vessels. As a result, mail to various ports along the Yangtze River was also indirectly delayed.</p>
<p>Large Numbers of Ships Anchored at the Mouth of the Song River</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, only the British Mail Company's mail ship Camora, loaded with silk and tea worth 2.5 million yuan and a large number of passengers bound for Europe, risked sailing because mail ships cannot be delayed. However, after arriving in Wusong, it immediately anchored and waited for the wind to stop before proceeding. In addition, the Jardine's Jinsheng, Guisheng, the EWO's Glen Line, and the China Merchants' Anning and Taiping also sailed to the mouth of the Wusong River and anchored nearby. In total, more than twenty import and export ships were blocked at the mouth of the Song River. Only a few import ships arrived yesterday, including the Yangtze River vessels Jiangda, Xiangtan, Shashi, Pinghe, and the Great Lai's Cleveland, and the Taikoo's Jinan. The rest were unable to sail into the Huangpu River.</p>
<h3>Observatory Denies Shanghai Will Have Major Flooding</h3>
<p>Social Affairs Bureau Sends Personnel to Inquire, Father Zi Firmly Declares</p>
<p>Father Zi of the Xujiahui Observatory issued a special denial in response to a Nanjing telegram published in a newspaper yesterday, claiming that according to the observatory's predictions, Shanghai would experience a ten-foot-high tidal wave around September 12th (Lunar August 1st). He stated that the observatory had never made such a prediction and did not know what the telegram was based on. He expressed regret that attributing such an alarming message to the observatory had frightened the citizens.</p>
<p>Upon seeing a Nanjing telegram in a local newspaper yesterday reporting that Shanghai would experience major flooding, stating that according to a report from the Shanghai Observatory, a flood of twelve feet was expected to occur in Shanghai on the first day of the eighth lunar month, the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau found this news to be quite strange. How could it be known that such a major flood would suddenly occur on the first day of the eighth lunar month, and how was this twelve-foot measurement calculated? Since it was claimed to be a report from the Shanghai Observatory, the Bureau immediately sent personnel to the Xujiahui Observatory to investigate. M. BURGAUR, the acting director of the observatory, firmly stated that there was no such report and that he did not know where the so-called Flood Relief Association obtained this information. The director will issue a letter of confirmation, which will state, in brief: "Currently, personnel from the Social Affairs Bureau have brought the News and the Shen Bao, which contain a news article stating that a major flood will occur in Shanghai on the first day of the eighth lunar month (lunar calendar). After investigation: (1) This observatory has never issued this news; (2) This news must be the result of personal speculation, causing considerable disturbance to society, which this observatory is quite concerned about." The observatory also requested that the Social Affairs Bureau investigate the source of the news and the location of the Flood Relief Association.</p>
<p>Note: This newspaper does not have this record, and we are deeply shocked to be involved. We hereby make a solemn statement.</p>
<h3>Disaster Relief News from Various Provinces Yesterday</h3>
<p>Relief Authorities Have Concrete Plans</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Individuals Continue to Actively Raise Funds</p>
<p>The responsible authorities issued a statement yesterday regarding the urgent relief efforts for the floods in various provinces, stating that they have concrete plans. Enthusiastic individuals from both China and abroad are also working hard to raise relief funds. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen Discusses Disaster Relief Policies</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chairman Song of the Disaster Relief Committee issued the following statement: "In order to decide on the steps for disaster relief, we must first understand the various issues involved in disaster relief work. The first step should be to prepare food, shelter, and medicine for the tens of thousands of homeless victims. The second step, after the water recedes, is to prepare food for those who cannot work and to employ the victims to repair old dikes and build new dikes, providing relief through labor. During this period, we will also widely encourage farmers to rush to plant vegetables and wheat before winter arrives. Finally, we should prepare to provide farmers with seeds and agricultural tools for spring plowing. According to our committee's observations, this work cannot be completed in a matter of weeks and will likely take at least six months. The committee will need to concentrate the government's allocated funds, private donations, and various food supplies as much as possible to provide relief. Currently, the government will need to bear 60 million yuan for urgent relief work. In addition to preparing funds to purchase ordinary supplies, we plan to purchase 50 million yuan worth of grain on credit. In summary, the losses of fields, crops, and property in this flood are so great that even 100 million yuan in cash may not be enough to meet the urgent needs of tens of millions of victims. In addition to the government's various forms of assistance, we also have the full support of Chinese and foreign individuals, charitable organizations, religious groups, the Yangtze River Conservancy Commission, the Huai River Conservancy Commission, the Whangpoo Conservancy Board, and other official public works agencies. Furthermore, missionaries in the interior who are familiar with local conditions can also assist with the current relief efforts and future projects. In view of the above situation, the committee firmly believes that the relief work can be handled exclusively by this committee, but we hope that all private charitable organizations can cooperate with this committee. To reduce expenses and strictly control the budget, all income and expenditure of funds will be carefully reviewed by the members of the accounting and auditing groups to prevent fraud. The names of the members are listed below: Bennett (Citibank), Chen Guangfu (Shanghai Bank), Hubbard (Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation), Lawrence (Reiss &amp; Co.), Ji Fusun (Zhejiang Industrial Bank), Lin Kanghou (Shanghai Banking Association), Lu Bohong (Nanshi Electric Light Company), Omura (Mitsui &amp; Co.), Song Hanzhang (Bank of China), Waldson (Accounting Advisor, Ministry of Finance), Zhang Jia'ao (Bank of China) (Director of this group)."</p>
<h3>News from the Relief Committee</h3>
<p>Donation Collection Agencies</p>
<p>The Disaster Relief Committee announced today that in addition to eleven foreign banks and twenty-five domestic banks, the Yida Tongchun, Fukang, Fuyuan, Zhixiang, and five other native banks have also agreed to collect donations.</p>
<p>The Situation of Disaster Victims in Wuhan</p>
<p>According to reports from Committee Member Li Zushen, the Disaster Relief Committee has established more than seventy shelters in the Wuhan area, which can accommodate 200,000 refugees. He also stated that there are 10 million disaster victims in Hubei Province, 5 million of whom are in urgent need of relief. The actual number of disaster victims in the Wuhan area is estimated to be 400,000.</p>
<h3>Zhu Cha and Others Postpone Flight to Hankou</h3>
<p>Zhu Qinglan, a standing committee member of the relief committee, and Bai Liangzhao, a member of the North China Charity Federation, were dispatched by the National Government's Disaster Relief Committee to investigate the details of the floods in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. They were scheduled to fly to Hankou from Shanghai at 7:00 AM yesterday to investigate the disaster situation along the way. However, due to the heavy wind and rain in Shanghai yesterday, the plane could not take off. Zhu and others waited for the plane at Longhua Airport for about an hour, but as a result of the bad weather, the flight was postponed until today or tomorrow, depending on when the wind and rain subside.</p>
<h3>Foreign Representatives Hold Disaster Relief Meeting</h3>
<p>The North China Daily News reported that representatives of the foreign community in Shanghai preparing for disaster relief held another meeting at the Fook Company yesterday (24th) afternoon, chaired by Major Nathan. They elected members of the executive, finance, and fundraising groups and resolved to organize one or two hospital ships with the funds raised to go to Hankou to treat diseases and prevent epidemics. According to the chairman's report, he has already contacted a ship, and the monthly rent is 10,000 yuan, plus medicine and other expenses, estimated to cost about 60,000 yuan in total for three months. Currently, only 12,000 yuan has been raised, and efforts must be made to raise more funds.</p>
<h3>Unbearable Disaster in Xinghua</h3>
<p>The flooding in Jiangbei this year is particularly severe, with Xinghua being the worst affected. A visitor from Jiangbei recently spoke about the tragic situation in the county, which is unbearable to hear. The county's terrain is low-lying, more than three feet below the bottom of Hongze Lake, shaped like a pot. Water must fill the entire area before it can seep into neighboring counties. This time, the three dams were opened simultaneously, pouring straight down. The west is about two feet higher than the east. The western and southern villages around Jiuli Jiaowazhuang were the first to be hit, and many houses were washed away and lives were lost due to the suddenness of the disaster. Almost none of the farmers who were in the fields harvesting the young rice survived. The three dam openings totaled more than 180 feet. Traditionally, a dam could only be opened every four days, with the water level rising four inches, and it had to be announced three days before opening the dam to allow the downstream people to prepare. This year, the river workers were unaware of the situation and opened the three dams suddenly within three days (the South Gate Dam was secretly opened by the river workers), and the water rushed down like an arrow, scouring the banks and causing destruction overnight. The ground in each village suddenly deepened by several feet. Farmers fled for their lives, fathers, sons, wives, and children unable to take care of each other. Some climbed onto rooftops or clung to trees, their cries were unbearable to hear. In the eastern part of the county, there are still one or two embankments that have not been breached. On the ninth of this month, news of a collapse was heard. Those guarding the embankment were unable to escape and dozens of people were washed away with the water. The fields and crops in the embankment were immediately submerged. The residents in the embankment were forced to live in the open on the embankment, suffering from hunger and heat. Many died, the old and weak groaned, and the young and strong moved away. There has been no relief to this day. Currently, except for a few high spots that have not been flooded, the lowest point in the county is five feet deep. Outside the city, there is a vast expanse of water. Where treetops are visible above the water, that is where the villages and markets used to be. The flooding of the entire county is terrible, and the water level is still rising every day, and the future consequences are unknown. The county has suffered from continuous famine for four years and was already in a precarious situation. Now that it has suffered this unprecedented disaster, the people are bound to starve to death. The provincial government has only allocated 5,000 yuan for urgent relief, which is a drop in the bucket and does not help. We hope that the great philanthropists in Shanghai will take into account the severity of the disaster in the county and allocate relief funds in abundance, so that the people of the county will be grateful beyond measure.</p>
<h3>Recent News from the Jiangsu Flood Relief Association</h3>
<p>Continued Reports from Various Counties (7) Liuhe County: This county experienced continuous heavy rain this summer, with mountain floods and rising river tides, resulting in the collapse of embankments on the southwest and east sides, inundating 99% of the fields. People and livestock were washed away, and houses were destroyed, creating a heart-wrenching scene. It is estimated that more than 400,000 acres of fields were affected, exceeding half of the county's total acreage. Nearly 100,000 disaster victims were displaced, gathering on small hills and high ground, their cries echoing in the air. (8) Liyang County: This county, also known as the ancient Jingjiang area, has extremely low-lying terrain. This summer, with continuous rain and mountain floods, most of the polders were breached. The crops in the higher fields were exposed to the floodwaters. The middle farmers exhausted their resources to save the embankments in the hope of having a harvest. However, in mid-July, there was another heavy rain, and the water level rose further. As a result, all the polders in the area were submerged. From Yixing in the east to Jintan in the north, and from the northwest to Hekouzhen, there was no embankment that was not breached and no crop to be seen. In addition, the water from the mountains in southern Anhui and the floodwaters from Wuhu, Gaochun, and the Yangtze River poured down, destroying and washing away people, livestock, houses, farmland, and crops. Looking from a high point, thousands of square miles were flooded, and the villages and residents were locked in by water, with no way to escape, and were left to die. (9) Suqian County: Since summer, the county has experienced continuous rain, which has inundated the crops. On the 2nd of this month, there was another heavy rain, causing the Yi and Yun rivers to rise sharply. The areas where the embankments collapsed have all become swamps, especially the Yaowan and Huanghe areas. (10) Huaiyin County: The county is located at the intersection of the Yun and Huang rivers and borders Hongze Lake to the southwest. Since the summer, there has been continuous rain, and the Huai and Yun rivers have risen, causing a severe disaster. In the first, second, sixth, and seventh districts, the water depth is about eight feet, and the shallowest is three to five feet. Houses and autumn crops have been destroyed and submerged. Hundreds of thousands of victims are living in the open, their faces showing signs of malnutrition. (11) Jintan County: The county's industry and commerce have never been developed, and the livelihoods of the common people depend entirely on agriculture. However, on July 5th of this year, there was a torrential rain that lasted all night, and the low-lying areas all became swamps. The embankments were also submerged in the water. Farmers ran around, shouting and rescuing, exhausting their mental and physical strength, hoping to make up for a fraction of the loss. However, on July 23rd and 24th, there was another downpour, and the streets were flooded, cutting off traffic. The suburbs were an ocean, and animals and houses were washed away.</p>
<h3>Wu Zhaozeng's Letter to Wang Yiting and Di Chuqing</h3>
<p>Regarding the Issue of Opening the Sanmao You River</p>
<p>Respectful greetings to Mr. Yiting and Mr. Chuqing,</p>
<p>I recently received your instructions stating that the citizens of Xinghua County have sent a telegram stating that the county has become a swamp because the Dafeng Yuhua embankment is blocking the water from flowing into the sea, causing great suffering to the people. They requested that the company be telegraphed to quickly open the Sanmao You River to facilitate drainage. You also expressed your willingness to sacrifice the Dafeng Company to save the people. Your bodhisattva-like heart is admirable and worthy of our respect. Regarding this matter, ten days ago, when the Cheluo Dam was opened, I received a letter from Leng Yujun Yuqiu, which had already telegraphed Dafeng to quickly discuss with Yuhua opening the Mao You East Dam as a temporary route for the western water. Later, I received a clever telegram from the company, stating that the water level in Dongtai was rising two or three inches every day, and that it was still two feet lower than the highest point of the people's houses. It has been more than ten days since the Cheluo Dam was opened. The company is located to the east of Dongtai, which is higher than the hinterland. How can it block the water from flowing into the sea? This is a fact. The rumors are turbulent, which is understandable given the urgency of the situation. However, what will be the consequences of provoking ill feelings? Scholars and officials are ignorant of the situation in the lower reaches of the river, and are occasionally deceived. The provincial government also lacks accurate surveys and announcements to maintain a fair discussion. I cannot help but worry. Now, I would like to briefly tell you two gentlemen about the situation in the lower reaches of the river, which has been recorded in history, and the current state of the salt fields: (1) Regarding the entry of diverted water from the east into the sea, during the Qianlong period, Tang Bin listened to the words of local scholars and officials and submitted a memorial. At that time, Jin Fu was the river governor, and strongly stated that the sea embankment could not discharge the water from the lower reaches of the river, and that a heavy dike should be built to block the water from entering the sea from Qingkou. The matter was submitted to the ministers for discussion and reply. Yu Chenglong advocated opening the sea embankment. As a result, scholars, officials, and court officials jointly criticized Jin Fu, who was almost punished and even had his fat subordinate Chen Hanzhi removed from his post to appease public opinion. Later, Yu Chenglong and Sun Zaifeng were specially sent to open the lower reaches of the river directly to the east into the sea. Over the years, due to the actual situation, the sea embankment could not be opened in the end. Yu Chenglong admitted his mistake, and Jin Fu's original proposal was adopted. Jin Fu believed that the water discharged by the canal should be centered on the lower reaches of the river, which included several counties, with a length of more than 300 miles from north to south and more than 200 miles from east to west, shaped like a pot. Only by digging in the bottom of the pot could the depth of the pot be increased. It would be impossible to go directly east into the sea, and opening it would be useless. Liu Qin's Dingmao poems on sensitive events state: "East of Bangjiang Bank, the accumulated water is always vast, covering seven prefectures and counties, and the coastal area is particularly elevated." This ancient saying proves that the coast is high. Today, Xinghua and Gaoyou have become vast lakes, while Dongtai, Yancheng, and Funing, which are located in the east, are not yet severely affected by water, which also shows that the terrain is different. Now, pointing to the salt reclamation company's embankment as blocking the western water should be proven with reason, and cannot be an act of transferring anger. Previously, I saw Zhuang Songlao's instructions on the Huai River diversion plan, which also stated that the water should be introduced into the river in the south and into the sea in the north, with the Chuanbang River as its tributary. It can be seen that those with practical experience have the same views. Those who can divert the water into the sea have five ports that can be connected. It is impossible to draw water from farmland. (2) The salt reclamation company is located outside the Fan Dike, providing a livelihood for the salt workers who are unable to survive on the coast. Since its establishment, it has dredged the old large ports on the west water side that enter the sea, and has not blocked them. The meridian and river, which has the function of transportation and irrigation, also has its own segment-specific models. It is a pity that it has not been able to get the government's help to connect them. There is also a plan to expand the Mao You River entering the sea, and dozens of plans have been completed, which can be used for temporary discharge. According to Jiangbei's arguments, there is a proposal to make the water run on the ground against the dikes of the salt reclamation companies, in order to restore the ancient floods. If this is the case, then the country should not seek construction in order to achieve the effect of drought and flood prevention. Salt reclamation shareholders have invested for more than ten years, and millions of debts and investments have not been paid. Now, they are still comforting themselves by saying: "Although we have suffered losses, hundreds of thousands of poor and helpless salt workers are gradually making a living." Now, the people in the lower reaches of the river, due to the water damage, have targeted the salt reclamation companies. We have telegraphed the reclamation area to properly arrange for it to comfort the people. Now, I see the reclamation area's telegram reporting that some people are inciting ignorant people to freely excavate, and yesterday I also presented a petition to the provincial government, requesting that it be stopped to avoid riots. The salt reclamation company is not greatly affected by the western water because the terrain is higher, but it is only afraid of the sea tide. If the sea tide is allowed to backflow, it will turn the reclaimable area that has been cultivated for more than ten years into bare teeth, and the water in the lower reaches of the river will still not be able to leave the five ports and enter the sea from the company's boundary, because the land is originally higher than the water in the lower reaches of the river, and the water cannot go uphill. This matter has been investigated by the local pro-people assemblies, and they have said that the people's lives in the interior are important, and the reclamation area's lives are also important. We should aim for mutual benefit. Moreover, the lower reaches of the river are only affected by the western water for one year, while the company's land is affected by the sea tide, and it will take ten years of cultivation to restore it. Although the company has a plan for the Sanmao You River, only the middle Mao You is connected to the sea, while the south Mao You is trapped by the economy and has not yet been dredged, and is still far from the coast. The north Mao You does not even have a river shape. The Dafeng north section has no embankment along the coast, and the western water can still run rampant. The local people know this, but they still spread their words to scare people, so it is suspected that they have an effect. In short, the reason why the western water is a disaster for the lower reaches of the river is actually in the upper reaches, west of the Yun Dike, where the bottom of the lake and the bottom of the river are gradually silting up, and the capacity is becoming shallower. Now, the Huai River diversion is ready to proceed, and the flooding of the canal can be reduced in the future. Chief Sun said that water conservancy is not something that can be done by Jiangsu Province alone, and he is truly aware of the situation. After all, there has never been water conservancy that is divided and governed by boundaries. You two gentlemen have always had clear eyes and no obstacles in your hearts. Therefore, I am not afraid of trivial words and hope that you will consider the actual situation, weigh the importance of things, and uphold justice. Those who are spared are many, and rescuing the disaster is the same merit. Please give your instructions if appropriate.</p>
<p>With respectful greetings,</p>
<p>Wu Zhaozeng</p>

<h3>The Sino-Foreign Relief Association Undertakes Emergency Relief Efforts</h3>
<p>The Sino-Foreign Relief Association reports that Hankou has been submerged for over twenty days, with a foul stench spreading disease and a severe shortage of food and drink. In addition to allocating funds for emergency relief, the association yesterday shipped four thousand bottles of cholera medicine, with director Yan Chengde dispatching personnel to distribute it to curb the spread of disease. They have also prepared five hundred bags of flour and seventy boxes of bread, which will be shipped to Hankou immediately for distribution. It is reported that strong northerly winds are blowing in Hankou, and there are concerns that the river may rise again. The association held an emergency meeting yesterday to discuss effective relief methods. The Sino-Foreign Relief Association has been receiving numerous letters and telegrams from various locations requesting relief, detailing tragic disaster situations. Benevolent individuals from various places are also generously donating to support the relief efforts. (1) The Yongshan Society, recognizing the significant donation of funds and medicinal supplies from overseas Chinese Hu Wenhu, was inspired to send 5,000 yuan. (2) The Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce wired 10,000 yuan.

<p>Yesterday, representatives from various organizations and groups attended the ceremony, including representatives from each organization, group, district party headquarters, and district branch offices, totaling approximately four hundred.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: After the ceremony, Chairman Pan Gongqing delivered his report, stating, "Central Oath Taker, representatives of various organizations and groups, comrades: Today is the inauguration ceremony for the third Executive Committee and Supervisory Committee members of the Shanghai Special Municipal Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang. We are honored to have Committee Member Zhang from the central government here to oversee the oath-taking, and representatives from various organizations and groups to provide guidance. As we hold this inauguration ceremony today, we should review the past work, determine future directions, and clearly understand the responsibilities of our comrades, so as not to fail the expectations of everyone. Now, I will briefly report on the work of comrades in Shanghai in recent years. There are things that are worth comforting ourselves with, but in general, we are still far from our ideals. Shanghai has been very important from the end of the Qing Dynasty until now, from the perspective of the revolution and the standpoint of the party. The cultivation of revolutionary forces and the launch of revolutionary work all started from Shanghai. Especially when the Northern Expeditionary Army conquered the Yangtze River basin and the communist elements became arrogant and subversive, endangering the party and the country, the purge movement started earliest and most thoroughly in Shanghai. Other provinces such as Guangdong, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Hubei suffered the tragedy of being burned, looted, and massacred by red bandits, but Shanghai was fortunate to escape this fate. The reason is that the general comrades and citizens of Shanghai were able to work together under the leadership of the central government. Therefore, this city has neither suffered the extreme labor-capital conflicts that Wuhan once experienced, nor the trampling by red bandits in Guangzhou and Haifeng, and it has not suffered the burning and killing in Jiangxi and Hunan. We can recognize that we can be slightly comforted by this. Moreover, because of the stability of social order in Shanghai, industry and commerce have been able to maintain their foundation and gradually develop and prosper, leaving a piece of intact work for the Central Plains and a fraction of vitality for the country. In recent years, the central government has been able to calmly suppress bandits and suppress rebellion, and make smooth progress militarily, so that the great cause of unification can be completed sooner or later. The assistance of Shanghai is undeniable. Just take this flood as an example. The disaster affected sixteen or seventeen provinces, with five or six thousand people being forced from their homes, with tens of thousands in gold being lost. Other areas are suffering from human-caused disasters and natural disasters. Fortunately, Shanghai, with its social stability and financial resources, has gathered the strength of its comrades to provide aid to our compatriots in other provinces and cities. The stability of Shanghai, seemingly a passive achievement, is something that we and our citizens can be proud of. However, there are many aspects of the work of comrades in Shanghai in recent years that are not satisfactory. The direction of future work should be changed. From the perspective of the spirit of party members, comrades in Shanghai seem to be more lax than in the era of secret work. If this continues, party members will become officials and the party headquarters will be close to the bureaucracy. It is important to know that the work of the party does not necessarily have to be done on a writing desk in the party headquarters. If everyone can do their best, use their own position to publicize doctrines, develop people's hearts, assist in autonomy, and carry out construction, then assuming that there are 6,000 party members in this city, there will be the strength of 6,000 comrades. Otherwise, only the efforts of the staff within the party headquarters will be available, and the city party headquarters, with one hundred people, combined with the district party headquarters and branches, will only have three or four hundred people. The difference is so small, and the error is so big. Is this not equal to reducing its strength? Therefore, starting from this session, the erroneous concept that comrades who do not work in the party headquarters do not have to do the work of the party should be absolutely corrected. Every party member should do his best for the party at all times and work hard. This is the first point. Secondly, the party anthem personally written by the Leader contains the two phrases "Counseling your many scholars, as the people's vanguard." The so-called vanguard is like the army's daredevil team and assault team, unafraid of sacrifice and difficulty, determined to kill oneself to achieve benevolence and abandon life to take righteousness. Only with this spirit can we lead the masses, and the masses will believe in the party members and thus obey the leadership of the party. If the party headquarters is high above and only issues an order or an official document to force execution, the masses may not dare to disobey, but how can it last? The Leader's instruction of 'vanguard of the people' originally wanted us to suffer first before the masses, not to flaunt our power above the masses. If every party member can recognize that the benefits belong to the people and the obligations belong to the party, not only will the masses be convinced, but the party will be the masses. The work of the party and the completion of the revolution will all be accomplished without any doubt. We certainly have the leader of our party, Mr. Sun Yat-sen's doctrines, spirit, morality, and learning, which can influence the people. But every party member must continue the spirit of the Leader and obey the doctrines of the Leader, so that our party can continue to influence the people and be their guide. In this way, the strength will be great and can complete a very difficult revolutionary work. From this session onwards, the executive and supervisory committee members should pay attention to the cultivation of party morality and party friendship, so that every comrade has the responsibility to serve the people and sacrifice for the party. This is the starting point for the development of the party's work in this city. This is the second point. Today, my comrades held an inauguration ceremony, very sincerely and frankly admitting the shortcomings of past work, and taking it as a direction for future efforts to improve. I hope that the central oath-taker and the representatives of various organizations and groups will give more guidance. Finished."</p>
<p>Oath-taking Committee Members: After the Chairman's report, each supervisory committee member, under the supervision of the Central Representative, raised their right hand and read the oath as follows: "I swear with utmost sincerity to abide by the Leader's last will, believe in the Party's doctrines, obey the Party's orders, abide by the Party's program and discipline, complete the national revolution, and realize the Three Principles of the People to seek China's freedom and equality. I will never act selfishly to mislead the Party or harm the organization. If I violate this oath, I am willing to receive the most severe punishment from the Three People's Principles." The names of the committee members who took the oath are as follows: (Executive Committee Members) Pan Gongzhan, Wu Kaixian, Tao Baichuan, Chen Xizeng, Yang Qingyuan, Chen Kecheng, Jiang Huaisu, Du Gang, Cai Hongyin. (Alternate Executive Committee Members) Hou Dachun, Lu Jingsheng, Huang Zaoxiong, Zhou Feicheng, Zhu Peng (Absent). (Supervisory Committee Members) Wang Yansong, Tong Xingbai, Huang Xuchu, Deng Tongwei, Xiong Shihui (Absent). (Alternate Supervisory Committee Members) Chen Bai, Zhang Zaibai.</p>
<p>Central Speech: After the oath, the Central Representative Zhang Yuejun gave a speech, stating: "Dear Committee Members, honored guests: Today, the committee members of the City Party Headquarters of this city are holding an inauguration ceremony, and the Central Committee sent brothers to come and oversee the ceremony. When the city held the Seventh City Representatives Congress last time to elect you all, the Central Committee also sent representatives to participate, which was a great honor. Just now, the chairman gave a detailed explanation and strict inspection and reflection on the importance of Shanghai's party affairs, the importance of Shanghai's party affairs and the relationship between the central government and the whole country, and the achievements of Shanghai's party affairs in recent years. We are very satisfied, and there is no need to add more explanation. Recalling when brothers participated in the Seventh City Representatives Congress, they once said that in addition to electing executive and supervisory committee members, the duties of the representatives congress are to accept the work reports of various agencies and examine and judge them as the standard for work, and to examine past work and determine the future direction of party affairs in the city. At that time, the representatives from the city gathered and studied with great concentration and proposed many important motions and decided on many concrete programs, resulting in a very satisfactory outcome. The resolutions of each case are deeply valuable and practical. Those who implement these resolutions are the committee members who are taking office today. I hope that the committee members will follow the guidance of the central government and implement the resolutions of the congress to make progress in the party affairs of this city. Brothers dare to believe that as long as you all work together with one heart, you will surely achieve your goals, because most of the committee members of this session are re-elected, and a few new committee members are also the comrades who are most familiar with the party affairs of this city. Naturally, you can achieve twice the result with half the effort. This is the first point I want to contribute to you all. The slogan 'Loyal Comrades Unite' was seen at the last City Representatives Congress and at today's inauguration ceremony. At the same time, brothers have been running around in various places in recent years and have often found such slogans. To be honest, brothers have felt infinitely emotional. On the surface, it is a very ordinary slogan, but why is it necessary to call on loyal comrades to unite? Of course, it is because there are some who are not loyal or because some who are loyal are unable to unite and unable to cooperate. The strength of the party is based on spiritual unity and unified will. Only with a spirit of unity and a unified will can there be mutual love and sincerity. Only then can the strength of the party be manifested and the revolutionary work can be completed. Not only in our country but in all the famous parties in the world, the organization, actions, and thoughts of their party members are simply completely militarized and disciplined. There is absolutely no individual will, only the will of the party. There is absolutely no individual action, only the action of the party. There is no such thing as loyalty and disloyalty in a party. All comrades have feelings, and I hope you will think deeply about this, and people must strive to achieve no longer seeing this kind of slogan and hearing this kind of shout, then the party morality and party friendship of our party will surely improve, and the strength of the party will be enough to eradicate all reaction and guarantee the peace and unification of the country. This is the second point I want to contribute to you all. The importance of the Fourth National Congress of the Communist Party of China is to contribute the items for discussion issued by the central government for a detailed and careful study for presentation to the Central Government in order to facilitate discussion."</p>
<p>Committee members' reply: After the speeches by the guests, Tong Xingbai, the representative of the executive and supervisory committee members, gave a reply, which has been omitted.</p>

<h3>Detectives Arbitrarily Investigate Pedestrian Disputes</h3>
<p>Neither Having a License Nor Acting Under Orders to Inspect</p>
<p>The plaintiff says more than ten silver dollars have been confiscated</p>
<p>Yesterday around four o'clock in the morning, a man named Chen Yuqing was returning from a business meeting with a friend near the North Railway Station when six or seven men suddenly approached him and stopped him. They searched him arbitrarily and found nothing. As a result, they took away more than ten silver dollars that were in his pocket. At first, Chen suspected they were plainclothes military police acting under orders to inspect pedestrians. But when he saw them snatching his silver dollars, he suspected that they were not good people. He asked them to show their badges, but they had no evidence of any official capacity. Chen immediately called the police to arrest them. One of them, surnamed Huang, claimed to be a detective from the Municipal Public Security Bureau's detective team, who had been ordered by his captain to inspect pedestrians. The police officer asked to see Huang's detective license, but Huang claimed that he had left his gun license at home and had not brought it out. The police officer, seeing no evidence, detained both Chen and Huang at the Fourth District Headquarters. The district chief conducted a preliminary hearing, during which Chen Yuqing described how he had been searched. Huang then identified himself as Huang Dongchen, currently a detective in the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and claimed that he was passing by the North Railway Station when he saw Chen and others arguing by the roadside, so he stepped in to mediate. The district chief, based on the evidence, immediately contacted the detective team. Team leader Lu, upon hearing the news, said that Huang was indeed a detective in the team, but he had not been ordered to inspect pedestrians in that area. He immediately ordered detective Zhou to go to the Fourth District Headquarters to clarify the situation. Zhou, accompanied by the police officer, first went to Huang's home and brought the detective license and gun to the district headquarters. Detective Zhou then took Huang, along with his gun and license, back to the team. Huang was first detained, and the incident was reported to Bureau Chief Chen. Bureau Chief Chen was furious, as Huang had neither received orders from his superiors nor carried his license or gun, yet he had arbitrarily gathered people to search pedestrians, which clearly indicated ulterior motives. He ordered Huang to be temporarily detained. As for the plaintiff, Chen Yu, he has been transferred to the Judicial Section by the Fourth District for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Defalcation of Over a Million: Shen Chengfu Flees</h3>
<p>Cotton Buyer of Tahe Foreign Firm</p>
<p>Court Issues Arrest Warrant, Search Proves Fruitless</p>
<p>Only Three of Shen's Cars Recovered</p>
<p>Police Discover He Fled to Qingdao</p>
<p>Shen Chengfu, a native of Shaoxing, age 36, was the junior owner of Zhihe Money Exchange. He resided at No. F2, Lane 1168, Jing'an Temple Road, Jing'an Temple. He was employed as a buyer in the cotton department of the British Tahe Foreign Firm at No. 15, Museum Road. Recently, he sold the firm's cotton, but did not remit the payments to the firm owner, embezzling them for his own use. The amount reached over a million, a matter discovered by the firm owner. Knowing he could not remain in Shanghai, Shen secretly fled with his entire family. The firm then reported the matter to the General Inspectorate of the Shanghai Municipal Police, who in turn requested the First Special District Court to issue an arrest warrant. The search proved fruitless. Zhang Zhiqing, the Chinese Detective Inspector of the General Inspectorate, and Geng Debiao, the detective, along with the Western Detective Inspector Huai Aituo, recovered three of Shen's cars. Yesterday morning, Ru Bao-yi, the police lawyer, requested the Special Court to dispose of them, stating the locations where they were found: (1) A Chrysler, No. 47, found at Aixueke Xuzi; (2) A Peugeot, No. 454, found at Aixueke Xuzi; (3) An Austin, No. 4702, found at Aixueke Xuzi. The first two cars were found at No. 38, Nanyang Road, and the third at the Mobil Automobile Repair Shop at No. 74, Beijing Road, discovered by the detectives. The police now know that Shen has fled to Qingdao, so they are requesting the court to reissue the warrant for general arrest, to facilitate sending personnel to Qingdao to apprehend him. Xu Jia-shi, the chief of the criminal court, reported the case, and it was ordered that, as Shen Chengfu's arrest has not been achieved, a general warrant should be reissued. The three cars are approved for detention and will be temporarily stored at the police station as collateral.</p>

<h3>Children's Welfare Association Warns Foster Mother</h3>

<p>Zhu Zhao-di, a nine-year-old girl from Haining, Zhejiang, was given to Zhu Chen, who runs a pancake shop at No. 85, Zhoushan Road, as an adopted daughter for a certain price due to her family's extreme poverty. Since entering the household, she has been repeatedly abused by her foster mother. Besides being assigned dangerous tasks, she is often beaten with firewood for minor offenses. Neighbors, feeling indignant, righteously reported this to the Chinese Children's Welfare Association. The association sent staff members, accompanied by Chinese and Western detectives from the Huishan Police Station, to investigate. After taking detailed statements, they brought Zhu Chen and Zhao-di to the police station for questioning. Zhu Chen confessed to the beatings. Finding no injuries on Zhao-di, they gave Zhu Chen a severe warning in person. Meanwhile, undercover detectives will continue to investigate, and the girl will be temporarily returned to the Zhu Chen family for a trial period to show leniency. If any further abuse is found, they will be arrested according to the law without fail. It is said that Zhu Chen, after receiving this warning, wants to improve her adopted daughter's life and does not want to abuse her again.</p>

<h3>Violent Incident of Competition Between Male Patrons</h3>
<p>Jin Ying-pei Beaten and Injured, Lin Ying Detained Awaiting Sentencing</p>
<p>Jin Ying-pei, an 18-year-old Guangdong native residing at No. 5, Xinchang Lane, Tiantong Road, worked as a water meter installer at the Anmei Foreign Firm on Dixiwei Road. At 2:25 PM on the 10th of this month, near the Xin'ailun Cinema on Haining Road, he was suddenly beaten to the ground by a fellow Guangdong native and stabbed in the back and abdomen with a knife, causing profuse bleeding. The Hongkou Police Station dispatched Chinese Detectives Liang Yong-ji and He Cheng-rui to the scene, who transported the injured person to Tongren Hospital for treatment and arrested a suspect, Lin Ying, a Guangdong tea boy, at the Hongkou Grand Hotel on North Sichuan Road. He was taken to the First Special District Court for interrogation and denied the charges. According to the police investigation, both the defendant and the injured person were patrons of Yue Jiulan, a Cantonese prostitute at No. 1142, North Jiangxi Road. The cause of the conflict was jealousy. However, the prostitute fled after the incident and is nowhere to be found. It was ordered that the case be re-examined after Jin recovers. Yesterday morning, the hearing resumed. Judge Shen Jiong-rong of the Third Criminal Court interrogated the parties. According to the police lawyer Li Zhi-shan, the prostitute Yue Jiulan was still impossible to apprehend. It was learned that the plaintiff was a member of the Xinli'an Club, and the defendant was a member of the Gonghele and Xin Shenhe Clubs. Fights often occur among the members of these clubs. The plaintiff Jin Ying-pei stated that he was going to see a movie at the Xin'ailun Cinema on Haining Road and had just arrived at the entrance when he saw a group of people fighting. He was trying to avoid them, but because he was wearing wooden clogs, he couldn't move quickly enough and was knocked down by someone in a white shirt and shorts, who stabbed him twice in the back and abdomen with a knife. He saw the defendant standing by watching, but he didn't make a move. He had played mahjong with him a few times but had no arguments. He hired lawyer Wu Shao-shan for defense. The defendant insisted that he was out shopping at the time and was just passing by watching, and he knew nothing about the incident. He had never met the plaintiff and had never played mahjong with him. He pleaded for justice and also hired a lawyer for defense. After examining the testimonies, Judge Shen ordered the defendant to be detained and set a date for sentencing.</p>

<h3>Rice Market in the Storm</h3>
<p>Rice Price Limited to Seventeen Yuan, Sale of Polished Rice Prohibited</p>
<p>The Wuchen Society reports: The price of rice has been gradually declining to 17 yuan per shi due to the Social Affairs Bureau's multiple adjustments. However, some rice merchants are still insincere and undermine the efforts. A notice was specially issued yesterday and posted in the North and South rice markets to serve as a warning. Furthermore, in view of the fact that polished rice not only wastes resources but also hinders health, the rice shops and trade associations are instructed to no longer seek polished rice for the market. Yesterday, the price of rice suddenly rose by about one yuan per shi due to the severe weather. After the investigators reported to the bureau, the bureau immediately instructed the rice merchants that the storm was a temporary phenomenon and that they must not hoard with the intention of making a profit. Therefore, the price of rice has not risen sharply. The notice and instructions are excerpted as follows: Notice: This year's floods in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River have caused a disastrous autumn harvest, which is expected. The harvest in Gao Tian is still acceptable, and the early rice harvest in Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu is quite abundant. The late rice is also developing well. The rice fields in Pudong are better than ever before. Moreover, after last year's bumper harvest, the grain reserves in various places are not meager. There should be no concerns about maintaining the current food supply. However, some rice dealers and hoarders are taking advantage of the natural disasters to raise rice prices, disregarding the people's difficulties. They are violating orders and disregarding discipline, unaware of self-reflection. This bureau takes the welfare of the public as its welfare. Therefore, these harmful elements, although leniency has always been the policy, cannot be tolerated. This special notice is hereby issued to all rice merchants, peddlers, and hoarders. After this notice, the highest price of japonica rice in this city is 17 yuan per shi, and the middle and lower grades are priced accordingly. If there is any secret price fixing, hoarding, or intentional harm to the food supply of the citizens, once discovered, it will be severely investigated and dealt with, and no leniency will be shown. This is hereby notified. The instruction to rice merchants is as follows: In order to comply with the order, the prohibition of milling refined rice is to enrich the people's food and focus on hygiene. Previously, this bureau had submitted a request to the municipal government and then to the Executive Yuan for approval, and a general order was issued to all provinces and cities to comply with and publicize the case. However, it was found that the rice shops are still providing refined rice to the citizens. When there is incoming rice, they compete to purchase it, and even transport it from the place of origin to Shanghai for sale. This has created a trend for unscrupulous merchants to hoard goods and is often a medium for high rice prices. After the floods, the hidden worries of a disappointing autumn harvest are deepening. The disaster victims are waiting to be fed, and every grain is difficult to obtain. However, they are still wasting resources and ruining God's gifts. Although every grain is sought after, or it is out of the needs of the citizens, this industry can always think that the people's food is difficult to maintain, and the bad habits should be eliminated as soon as possible. The government orders should always be adhered to, and they should not be sold together. Even if citizens want to eat it, they cannot get it. This bureau deeply considers the regulation of people's food and should proceed from all parties to achieve it. There are also people who are wise and know the truth in this industry. Therefore, they should be kindly informed that they should no longer seek refined rice for sale, and even when citizens come to buy it, they should also be informed of the harm of eating it, which not only damages people's food but also harms hygiene. We should all think of the difficulties of resources and share the abundance of national food. In addition to the public notice, the association is hereby ordered to immediately forward the order to the industry to comply and print it out for all rice shops to post in obvious places, so that everyone knows it. Do not violate it.</p>

<h3>British Public Bus Drivers' Mediation Breaks Down</h3>
<p>The Company Proposes Five Conditions for Resuming Work</p>
<p>Workers' Congress Resolves to Continue Strike</p>
<p>After the strike of all ticket sellers of the British Public Bus Company, the company still reluctantly operated routes 1, 2, 5, 9, and the AB special express yesterday. The mediation by the drivers broke down. The company proposed five conditions for resuming work. The workers held a congress yesterday, and the labor community actively provided assistance. The various situations yesterday are recorded below. Mediation Breakdown: At 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, the British Public Bus Company drivers, based on the resolution of the delegates' congress, sent three representatives to the British China Public Bus Co., Ltd. on the Bund of the Great Horse Road to mediate on behalf of the ticket sellers' nine conditions of treatment. As a result, the manager completely rejected all nine conditions and put forward five conditions for resuming work. The three representatives believed that the company was relying on imperialist forces to excessively oppress the workers and were very angry and withdrew, resulting in the breakdown of the mediation.</p>
<p>Company Conditions: The company proposed the following conditions for resuming work: (1) Ticket sellers who wish to serve in the company as a result of the strike must submit a list on the morning of the 25th of this month; (2) The company may randomly select members from the list and allow them to serve temporarily, which will be announced on the 26th; (3) Those who wish to serve must comply with the following conditions: (a) Regardless of new or old ticket sellers, the monthly salary will start at 20 yuan, and monthly salary increases will be as usual; (b) The 20 yuan deposit will be kept by the company as usual; (c) All previous bonuses will be canceled, and the bonuses for serving members will be calculated as for new members; (d) This company plans to prepare special bonuses to encourage them; (e) Those who violate the company's regulations will be dismissed immediately, and those who disobey the orders of superior staff will also be dismissed; (4) Among the serving members, the company must select them, and after the selection, they must put their fingerprints on it before the review is carried out in order to withdraw them; (5) The selected members must report to this company for service within 24 hours after the formal announcement.</p>
<p>Workers' Congress: After the ticket sellers were dispersed from the Chinese Park the day before yesterday, they held a full workers' congress again at 8:00 AM yesterday morning. More than 190 ticket sellers attended. First, the chairman reported on the company's refusal to negotiate, and the atmosphere was very tense. On the spot, it was decided that: (1) The strike should continue; (2) Severe measures should be taken against the running dogs who undermine the strike; (3) All trade unions in the city should be asked for assistance.</p>
<p>Labor Community Assistance: After all the ticket sellers of the British Public Automobile Company went on strike on the 20th because they could not stand the unreasonable oppression of the imperialist company, the company refused to negotiate and instead dismissed all the workers and proposed conditions for resuming work. The first district water and electricity industry workers' union, the tenth district cotton spinning industry workers' union, the British Concession tram workers' union, etc., all sent representatives to express their condolences, expressing their willingness to act as a backing and fight imperialism to the end.</p>
<h3>Petition to the Ministry from the Postal Workers' Union</h3>
<p>Regarding the request to amend the Postal Administration Organization Law</p>
<p>A petition from the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union and the Postal Employees' Union to the Legislative Yuan, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Communications, regarding the request to amend the Postal Administration Organization Law, states: Since the promulgation of the Postal Administration Organization Law, it has severely disrupted the postal system, profoundly impacting the future of the postal service, causing widespread anxiety. We respectfully and clearly state the obstacles at each point, earnestly hoping that you will consider the difficulties in establishing the postal service and approve a review and amendment to benefit transportation and strengthen the foundation of the postal service. It is our understanding that China's postal organization system has always been considered sound, which is why it has maintained its reputation for over thirty years as a leading state-owned enterprise. Since the success of the revolution and the recovery of postal rights, although there have been many changes in administration, it has not been as disruptive as the current postal system. The Unions have a deep understanding of postal service and would like to clearly state the following: (1) Article 2 of the organization law stipulates one deputy director general, but does not clearly specify that they should be selected from among senior postal directors. According to the current regulations, the director general is comparable to the current general manager, while the deputy director general is comparable to the deputy manager. When postal rights were recovered, Minister Wang of the Ministry of Communications appointed a senior postal director as the general manager. At that time, the general administration regulations stipulated that the general manager and deputy manager must be filled by postal service personnel. Although subsequent acting general managers were not from the postal service, they still relied on the assistance of experienced deputy managers, so there were few obstacles. The current postal regulations still stipulate that the position of deputy manager must be filled by service personnel. It is understood that postal operations are difficult, and measures are not easy, so non-experienced postal personnel are not qualified. The Unions foresaw this and pleaded with the Ministry during the revision of the organization law to retain this inherent good principle of the postal organization to ensure that the hard-earned foundation of China's postal service would not be shaken. This is not only to select and reward postal personnel as a means of advancement, but the recently revised Postal Administration Organization Law by the Ministry suddenly removes the stipulation that the deputy director general should be appointed from postal personnel. The original good principle has no clear provision, causing widespread anxiety. It is believed that this will cause chaos in the postal organization and hinder the development of the postal service. As a matter of fact, the current deputy manager is a senior postal worker and has been appointed as deputy director general by the Ministry of Communications, which shows that the inherent regulations are suitable for the postal situation. However, without clear provisions, changes are difficult to prevent in the future, and cunning people will easily create a path of competition and pursuit. Therefore, we earnestly request the Ministry to approve a review and retention of the inherent principles, and to clearly stipulate that the position of deputy director general should be appointed from senior postal directors. (2) In addition to the General Affairs, Accounting, Business, Inter-Postal, and Supply Departments stipulated in Article 3, the Performance Appraisal and Audit Departments should still be handled by the Postal Administration. The Performance Appraisal Department is responsible for the promotion, demotion, and dismissal of postal personnel, which has always been handled in accordance with the regulations. Tens of thousands of employees rely on this for protection, and the postal foundation can be consolidated. The Audit Department is responsible for reviewing national postal revenue and expenditure and supervising accounting, which has always been strict. Postal finances can be cleared. These two departments are indispensable to the postal service. The new organization law does not stipulate that they must be assigned to other departments. If they are divided and transferred outside the Postal Administration, the entire good system and its system of the postal service will inevitably be broken. The theory is not sound, and the facts are full of obstacles. The consequences are endless and not a blessing for the transportation industry. Therefore, these two departments should still be handled by the Postal Administration to show consistency and strengthen the postal foundation, and should not be divided. (3) Article 4 stipulates that the Postal Administration may set up a chief secretary, which should also be clearly specified to be appointed by senior postal personnel. The chief secretary is comparable to the current head of the secretariat, and their powers are similar. The head of the secretariat and other department heads have always been filled by senior postal personnel. Article 3 of the new organization law also clearly stipulates that the directors and deputy directors of each department should be selected from postal directors and deputy postal directors. The chief secretary has similar powers and should be treated the same. Moreover, their responsibilities are important and cannot be assumed by non-experienced postal personnel. It should be clearly stipulated that the above three points are related to the development of the postal service, the convenience of the transportation industry, and the glory of the country. The Unions serve the postal service and cannot remain silent. In addition to presenting to the Executive Yuan and submitting to the Postal Administration to forward to the Ministry of Communications to request the Ministry to approve a review and amendment, we should submit another document to the Ministry to earnestly consider the postal service, comply with the wishes of the people, and approve a review and amendment of the obstacles in the Postal Administration Organization Law, which is both for public benefit. Furthermore, the position of Postal Inspector is very important. Although it has been appointed by the Ministry of Communications, it has not been clearly stipulated in the organization law, so it should also be requested by the Ministry to amend and clarify it. Respectfully submitted to the Legislative Yuan. Shanghai Postal Workers' Union and Postal Employees' Union, respectfully submitted on August 25th.</p>
<h3>Stalled Sale of Housheng Yarn Factory</h3>
<p>Due to Provisional Seizure of Xue Baorun's Assets</p>
<p>The sale of the Housheng Yarn Factory has now been declared stalled because, during the sale process, all assets of Xue Baorun, a major dye merchant, were provisionally seized by the court due to a lawsuit filed by his nephews, Xue Jinfu, etc., for asset division, thus causing the stall.

Once found, he will request the court to seize them and sue those who privately transfer ownership for compensation. At the same time, his representative lawyer has sent a letter to banks, financial institutions, and real estate trust companies, advising them to pay special attention to the court's decision to avoid future legal issues.</p>

<h3>County Government Proclamation to Clean Streets</h3>
<p>The County Government issued a proclamation yesterday, stating, "It is important to tidy up roads to improve the appearance of the city. The quality of roads is not only related to the appearance but also to local transportation and public health, which cannot be ignored. It has been found that in the street areas of various districts and towns in this county, melon peels, fruit shells, and garbage are arbitrarily displayed, encroaching on the road surface, obstructing traffic, and detracting from the appearance of the city. Moreover, during this autumn and summer season, dirty and unclean roads are prone to epidemics, which is of great concern to public health. It is necessary to earnestly pay attention to rectification to facilitate transportation and emphasize hygiene. In addition to ordering the Public Security Bureaus to strictly crack down on violations and ordering the district chiefs to pay attention to rectifying the situation at all times, a public notice is hereby issued to inform all the people of the county to be aware of the situation and order them to pay attention to street cleanliness to jointly maintain public health, not to accumulate debris or dump garbage along the street, or to obstruct road administration. Those who dare to arbitrarily disobey will be investigated and dealt with severely. They must all comply with this order."</p>

<h3>Yousheng Travel Group Advanced Viewing of the Tide</h3>
<p>The Yousheng Travel Group received a letter from its Haining members yesterday, stating that this year's tide is the largest in recent years. The group sent Zheng Jiahuan to investigate last week and confirmed that it was larger than in previous years, surging and turbulent, with some waves rising several feet above the embankment. Therefore, the group decided to advance the trip and agreed with the Railway Bureau to open a special second-class train. It will depart for Changan at 6:05 AM on the 30th of this month and return to Shanghai by the same train at 4:05 PM that afternoon. The round trip from Changhai will be handled exclusively by the Zhejiang Provincial Highway Bureau, with a cost of six yuan (including the fare to Haining). Meals are at one's own expense. The quota is 250 people. This trip to view the tide is economical in terms of time and cost, so registrations have been very enthusiastic recently.

<p>Letter</p>
<p>To the editor, yesterday I read a letter from the Shanghai County First District Office in your newspaper, which contained many concealments. On the afternoon of the 18th of this month at about 1:00 PM, our company loaded asphalt from Shanghai to the Minjing Wharf. When the porters were carrying it to the front of the store for unloading, District Chief Wu Jingqing passed by with a fierce demeanor and broke into the store. First, he smashed the abacus on the counter, and then he beat the store clerk Chen Axiao and ordered the security guards and police officers to take him to the First Public Security Bureau. He was detained for eight or nine hours, which caused public opinion to boil over and aroused public outrage. The next day, various merchants, in accordance with legal procedures, requested the Minhang Chamber of Commerce to convene a general meeting of members, and resolved to submit a request to have District Chief Wu removed from his post and investigated. The Chamber of Commerce recorded the case and reported it to the County Government. This is what happened at that time. However, the current acting chairman of the Minhang Chamber of Commerce is the accountant of the First District Office, so after the resolution of the general meeting, he tried to remedy the situation in various ways and reconvened a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees, which resolved that "a mediation should be attempted, and District Chief Wu should (A) issue a written apology, (B) compensate for the abacus and medical expenses, and (C) provide a written guarantee that he will not arbitrarily insult merchants in the future within three days." These documents are available and can be checked. In order to avoid confusion, I am writing to your newspaper to correct the record. Respectfully, Yichangxing Oil and Sesame Store, Minhang Town, August 25th, address: 55 Main Street, Minhang Town, Shanghai County.</p>
